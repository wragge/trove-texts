THE RED PAGE.
MARY GILMORE’S VERSES.
DAY gives her radiant face, whereon,
Love’s red shows ever love’s unrest,
But Night, her clinging arms and all
The wonder-whiteness of her breast.
THE moonlight flutters from the sky
To meet her at the door,
A little ghost, whose steps have passed
Across the creaking floor.
And rustling vines that lightly tap
Against the window-pane,
Throw shadows on the white-washed walls
To blot them out again.
The moonlight leads her as she goes
Across a narrow plain,
By all the old, familiar ways
That know her steps again.
And through the scrub it leads her on
And brings her to the creek,
But by the broken dam she stons
And seems as she would speak.
She moves her lips, but not a sound
Ripples the silent air ;
She wrings her little hands, ah, me 1
The sadness of despair !
While overhead the black duck’s wing
Cuts like a flash upon
The startled air, that scarcely shrinks
Ere he afar is gone.
And curlews wake, and wailing cry
Cur-lew 1 cur-lew ! cur-lew !
Till all the Bush, with nameless dread
Is pulsing through and through.
The moonlight leads her hack again
And leaves her at the door,
A little ghost whose steps have passed
Across the creaking floor.
HIS eyes looked into mine,—
O, look that made me wise !
I hid my own, although
My world lay in his eyes.
I turned away my face,
My breath came like a sob,
And to his heart my own
Gave answer, throb for throb.
I could not raise my eyes,
Lest he should read therein,
I trembled, woman-wise,
And woman-waked within.
&
SING sweet, little bird, sing sweet, sing sweet!
Throb little heart, and beat!
Swell little throat of the mellow note !
Sing sweet, O bird, sing sweet t
Love came to me yesternight, O bird,
Came with a kiss and a whispered word,
Crowned me (sing !) with a golden ring—
Sing to me, sing, O bird !
Love came to me yesternight (sing on !)
Dear were his eyes where the love-light shone,
Dear was his mouth in its burning drouth :
Sing, sing, O bird, sing on !
MY little love is sleeping
Under the orchard tree,
Awhile she has been weeping,
But now she dreams of me.
And round her mouth there hovers
A tender little smile,
Aud Love laughs at two lovers
Who had been cross awhile.
TIME waits not on our idle days,
The balance ever forward swings ;
Life goes impatient while we wait,
And takes again the hour He brings.
Love-red, and quick, he faces us—
Shall we turn back and bid him go
To wait till Time has paled his cheek
And set his bounding pulses slow?
Come then, Beloved, when the day
Sinks, splendid, to the watching West;
Time will not wait for us, then come , .
The hours shall die upon my breast,
YOU are there
An’ I am here ;
What’s it matter ?
Tell me, dear!
Side by side,
Or far away,
Love can ever
Find the way.
So I send
The Lovin’-Word,
Spoken soft, as
Though you heard.
Just a word
Across the sea,
Lightly whispered :
“You an’ me !”
Send it back,
O, sweet an’ true,
Just as whispered:
“Me an’you!”
MY hand in thine,
Thy hand in mine,
God gave me thee,
God made me thine.
Go not away,
O heart, my heart;
I have no soul
From thee apart.
I have no life
Thou dost not share,
No joy in hope,
No balm in prayer.
Stay with me, sweet—
The sad hours go ;
Stay' with me, sweet,
Nor leave me so.
Holds life, dear heart.
No more than this :
A look, a word,
A touch, a kiss ?...
Draw down the blind,
Shut out the day,
Bring tapers tall,
Fold hands, and pray.
DRAW down the blind,
The end is come ;
The eyes are wide,
The lips are dumb.
The loving kiss
No more shall thrill,
The loyal heart
At last is still.
Draw down the blind,
Shut out the sun ;
The journey ends
At half-begun.
LOVERS.
YOU ’RE a-wanting me
I’m a-wanting you,—
What’s us waiting for?
Life is wearin’ through.
What’s us waiting for,
Peaky-faced an’ sad ?
Life ain’t watchin’ round,
Hopin’ we 'll be glad.
Ti ne’s no good for us,
Life’s got nothin’ sweet:
Me a-mnpin’ here,
You across the street.
What should come between,
Partin’ of us two,
Y >u a-wantin’ me,
Me a-wantin’ you ?
Kiss me in the mouth,
Kiss me lovin’-fair,
What we 're waitin’ for
No one else ’ll care.
Kiss rne in the mouth,
Kiss me straight an’ true,
You a-wantin’ me,
Me a-wantin’ you.
SWEET-HEARTIN’
IT’S gettin’ hits o’ posies,
An’ feelin’ mighty good,
A-thrillin’ ’cause'she loves you,
An’ wonderin’ why she should.
An’ stopping sort of sudden
Because you ’re full of thought,
An’ quick with res’less feelings
That make life seem too short.
It’s feelin’ ’s if she’d loved you
Before the world was made,
An’ that she’ll keep on lovin’
Till all our debts are paid.
As if there’s nothing mattered,
As if all things were good,
As if the Lord was lookin’
An’ sorter understood.
It’s feelin’ kind an’ gentle
To ev’rvthing that’s weak,
An’ doin’ just such actions
As seem to nearly speak—
Such acts as women reckons
A man will always do
When he’s in love with someone,
An’ chat someone is you.
QUARRELIN'.
US is out, her an me,
Moonin’ round the square,
Tryin’ how to make, believe
As us does n’t care.
Us is out, her an’ me,
Just like fools,
Bustin’—achin’ fora word—
Obstinit as mules.
Us is out, her an' me,
Out—an’ all f’r what—
Things as ain’t the worth o’ that,
When you ’re love-forgot.
Us ain’t made to snap an’ snarl—
Us that’s one an’ two ;
Us ain’t made to jar an’ fret—
Us, that’s me an’ you.
Us ain’t made to go apart—
Kiss me lovin’-true—
Us that’s touchin’ mouth to mouth—
Us, that’s me an’ you.
MARRI’D.
IT 'S singin’ in an’ out
An’ round about the place,
Here an’ there, an’ up an’ down,
An’ feelin’ full o’ grace.
It’s rollin’ up your sleeves,
An’ whit’nin’ up the hearth,
An’ scrubbin’ out the floors,
An’ sweepin’ down the path ;
It’s bakin’ tarts an’ pies,
An’ shinin’ up the knives,
An’ feelin’ ’s if some days
Was worth a thousand lives.
It’s watchin’ out the door
An’ watchin’ by the gate,
An’ watchin’ down the road, —
An’ wond’rin’ why he’s late.
An’ feelin’ anxious like,
For fear there’s something wrong,
An’ wond’rin’ if he’s kep’,
An’ why he takes so long.
It’s cornin’ back inside,
An' sittin’ down a spell,
To sorter make believe
You ’re thinkin’ things is well;
It’s gettin’ up again,
An’ wand’rin’ in an’ out,
And feelin’ wistful like,
Not thinkin’ what about.
An’ flushin’ all at once,
An’ smilin’ jes’ so sweet,
An’ bein’ real proud
The house is nice an’ neat;
An’ feelin’ awful glad,
Like them that watched Silo’m—
An’ everything because
A man is cornin’ Home.
BABY.
KISSIN’, kissin’, kissin’,
Lordy ! ain’t he sweet
Rosy roun’ de mouf,
Rosy roun’ de feet!
Jes’ tuk out de water :
Fresher dan de rose ;
Kiss him little fis’s,
Kiss him little toes.
Ain’t no babby like him,
Couldn’t neber he—
Him dat all is mine,
Him dat's kissin’ me.
One Australian Girl .
MARY GILMORE’S verses, printed m
The Bulletin. The Worker (Q.), The Queens-
lander, The Clipper, and many other Australian
papers, have gained a wide popularity. Those
reprinted on this page exhibit her talent at its
best poetically speaking. In other examples, where she
strikes the note of social sympathy, she appeals to a
numerous class of readers with equal force and ettect.
Her work is often hasty—the rough embodiment of a
mood or an idea, quickly seized and crudely set
down. Yet sincerity and passion give the verse a rare
poignancy. Such a little homely gem as “ Marri d is
unique. The theme is commonplace ; even the vision is
commonplace ; but the power to express the vision at
that pitch and in that way is memorable.
There are other
MAR? GILMORE.
pieces in which a finer
phrase meets a finer
emotion. The emotion
is usually lyric a
momentary flash, a
natural cry, owing
little to “fundamental
brain-work.” ,It is the
eye, the imagination
of the Celt once more.
Mary Gilmore’s father
was. a Scottish High-
lander, “very High-
land ” ; and the char-
acter of her verse is
hereditary, attenu-
ated by admixture
and coloured often by
personal experience.
The work of such
a quick, alive, glanc-
ing, scintillating mind
is naturally full of unconscious echoes. Occasionally
one is reminded of the style or matter of Heine or
another. Mary Gilmore’s poetical value issues, in tact,
from instinct and temperament, and not from education,
though she has been well educated in the conventional
sense. The heat, the glow, the touch of phrase and
tingle of feeling that differentiate her work from mere
journal-verse—these she owes to her ancestry. Her work
is original in fibre.
Twice or thrice, as in “A Little Ghost,” it holds an
atmosphere of mystery, that indefinably haunting quality
which is given and received by no conscious artifice or
effort. At other times, M try Gilmore writes what might
be called epigrams of emotion —stanzas of four or eight
lines in which the words set themselves without premedi-
tation to the tune of feeling :
We did not think it, did we,
Looe had us in a net ?
Now w& may not remember
Nor yet may we forget.
A slight verse and simple ; yet there is something in the
saying that is noteworthy.
The story of Mary Gilmore’s life is remarkable.
She was born near Goulburn, N.S.W. Her father was a
Cameron, and her earliest and best-known verses appeared
over the initials “M.J.C.” Going to country schools at
Wagga and elsewhere, she became a pupil teacher
under N.S.W. Education Department at the age of
sixteen, after passing a brilliant examination. She
was given herchoice of appointment in Sydney or any
of half-a-dozen country towns, and chose Wagga as being
near her own people, and because she had gone to school
there. “I was only a gawky country girl dressed in a
home-made frock when I entered the school to begin
work, and when I went eagerly up to an old school-
fellow (she wore a watch, and her skirt was weighted
down with pennies instead of shot, and afterwards she mar-
ried a clergyman and wore glasses) she coldly gave me
the tips of her fingers and turned away to another girl,
whose dress had six pearl buttons where mine had one.”
A successful career as a teacher followed—at Silverton,
and later at Sydney—until Miss Cameron came within
the circle of the New Australia movement, and went to
Paraguay as a colonist.
“ I had a lot of fever in the colony ; and people said I
worked too hard. I was married there, and my child was
born in the neighbouring town. The nurse—an ex-
colonist—was drunk from before his birth till a week
after, and I did not write to the colony for help because I
did not care to expose her, thinking no one but I knew
she drank. Only for the kindness of a chance visitor I
would have died, and only for the nurse’s little girl of
eight 1 would have gone often all day, while in bed, with-
out food. A month before my child was born I went into
Villa Rica. When my child vvasitwo weeks old I returned
to the colony, and when he was sixteen days old I was at
the washtub—this because I knew every woman in the
colony had as much work to do as ever she could manage
without mine being added. I remember the longing I
had, when my child was born, toisend a wire to my hus-
band, but I was afraid of the expense—it would have
seemed like taking bread out of the children’s mouths,
and I sent only a letter. But I never think of that tele-
gram without a feeling of sadness. I was away and the
baby was come, and I had to wait for the chance of the
mail being sent for from the colony for my husband to
know.
“ I remember how we made a cot for the child. Will
split the timber—lapacho, a hard wood and a heavy—with
maul and wedges, then he trimmed down the splintered
sides with an adze, after which he split the pieces with
an old saw. He was weeks over the work—the wood was
so hard—then with a plane ancfa spokeshave he smoothed
all the surfaces. It was a bit out of plumb in some of its
legs, but it would take a beautiful polish. The idea of
the polish was a joy to us, but we had neither
the time nor the material to polish with, so the
joy never had a foundation in fact. And though
the cot was finished, 1 never put the, boy to bed
in it except by day. It seemed so cold-hearted to put
him away in the night, and we thought he might feel
lonely. ‘ Besides,’ his father said, ‘he is such a little
fellow.’ We made also a whatnot, but it was sawn out
with a crosscut—l was the architect, Will was the execu-
tive. It was a thing of beauty, actually had a bead on
its front edges, and wouldn’t go skew-wise if it stood
away from the wall. In fact, it could on occasion stand
alone ; but we kept it nailed to the wall for security and
safety’s sake.
“Some time after, we severed our connection
with the Gosme colony, and while Will was in Patagonia
I went into Villa Riea to live, renting the same
little house where my baby was born. The evenings were
pleasant, for it was May, and I used to sit in thg verandah
at sundown and even till nearly dusk. After a week of
this my landlord and his six daughters came one evening
to see me and remonstrate. ‘lt wasn’t safe,’ they gave
me to understand ; ‘ there were bandidos about.’ ‘ Would
I go indoors before sundown and fasten up the house ?'
And he hauled in the trunk of a small orange tree to add
to the security of .my door. This door opened in the
middle, had a holt top and bottom, and a double-lock in
the middle. He fastened the bolts, double locked the
door, and then jammed the sapling against the middle of
it. One of the daughters, to make things more secure,
brought in a long board ; this was propped in against the
upper part of the door. Some weeks afterwards, finding
the door rattle in a high wind, I examined the hinges.
There were no screws in them, only nails, old rusty nails,
andl about two to each hinge. I smiled. The thing was
so like Paraguay.
" After that I ceased to barricade the door in the
middle, and did it at the sides —not that it mattered
much, except as a precaution against it being blown in.
To this house used poor Larry Petrie to come after his
seventeen hours duty at the Railway Station. ‘ I.arry,
lurry, you foolish fellow,’ I used to say— 1 why don’t you
goto bed instead of coming up here?’' ‘Bed!’ he would
reply—‘ how can I sleep ? The carpenters work beside
me, and the lampmen are in and out all the time ; and so
ic’s a case of get drunk, or come and talk to yju,’ and he
would stay and talk till his nerves quietened, and then
tramp wearily hack to his little lamp-room for an hour’s
sleep. Twice he prevented a collision ; once he saved a
train from fire, and died at last with his ribs through his
lungs, his life given for that of the stationmaster’s child.
. J*
“ Will came up to Villa Rica from Patagonia,
intending we should all go down as soon as the summer
came. We went from Villa Rica to Sapucay (the Railway
works) and lived there two or three months. Then to
Buenos Aires for a few months. Here Will went shearing
in the Argentine—such an experience! In November
nearly three years ago we left for Gallegos, in South Pata-
gonia. From Gallegos the Falklands lie #ast 300 miles, so
you may' guess how cold it was. Magellan’s Strait is two
days’ ride south. On the way south an epidemic of
measles broke out; my little son took the complaint, and
inflammation of the lungs set in.
“There was no milk, water ran short; it was thick
and purple ; we were on a waterless coast in an old ship,
whose engines might blow up any time, whose condenser
only condensed enough for the first class, and used to
break out in leaks every second day. The Doctor suf-
fered from melancholia and loss of memory ; he was
kindness itself, and used invariably to pray over my little
one, but he dared not trust himself to do anything
beyond taking his temperature. When I would beg of him,
‘ Doctor, is there anything can be done?’ he would say,
‘ We can only wait, we can only pray ’—and sometimes,
‘He is too weak for anyone to do anything.’ We were 31
days on a voyage that should only have taken six or
seven. The Pacific boats do it in two-and-a-half. Yet
Billy lived.
“In Patagonia I was for a time governess to, I
think, the most awful girl that ever lived. She was six-
teen, looked eighteen, and called herself fourteen. She
knew everything ever known, and what I told her one
day she told me back in a day or two as entirely her own.
Among the items of her own peculiar knowledge was that
‘ she knew the woman who made all the lace for Queen
Victoria’s wedding.’ After tnree months governessing
I went from the Estancia to live in Gallegos. Here I was
advised to take up English teaching. I demurred on the
ground that I could not speak Spanish. 1 Oh, but you
are such a good English scholar,’ was the reply, ‘ you
should do well at it.’ It seemed a queer reply and a
queer reason for success, but there was a lot in it; so I
took a house and began teaching.
“My first pupil was Don Vicente Canb, of the Bank of
Argentina, nephew to a gentleman whose name I forget,
but who was one time Plenipo. for Argentina in London :
a fine scholar and a brilliant writer. Don Vicente lent
me his uncle’s translation of “ Henry V,” which was really
Shakespeare in another language. The first month of
teaching was dreadful. I felt such a fraud, fori hadn’t the
use of twenty words of the language, though with the dic-
tionary I could read fairly well. As the lesson hour came
round my knees used to shake with apprehension lest
Don Vicente wouldn’t come, and my stomach grew sick
in dread of the lesson should he come. Whichever way
it was, it was awful. Yet in a week Senor Cane brought
me other puDils, and the Deputy Governor sent me more.
Indeed, in a little while, I had to take a more convenient
house, and had as many pupils as I could manage. And
they were so kind, all of them. I got on splendidly with
my Spanish, and they were kind enough to say they did
well with the English—and indeed, after a while, I think
they did, for I tried hard enough. Moreover, they all
expressed their sorrow and disappointment when I told
them I was leaving. _ . .
“ Half the lessons I gave at my own house, the rest at
the houses of pupils, and many and many a day the wind
blew my little boy off his feet as we hurried along to a
lesson, or dashed me against a telephone post or a fence.
The wind is incessant. Except in the dead of winter, when
all is frozen, it never ceases. I have been half-an-hour
going 100 yards, and holding on to fences all the way,
and I have seen men—who wear no skirts—have to put
their hands to the ground to maintain their balance. My
little boy I couldn’t leave at home, as he was too young,
and a servant was out of the question. Only soldiers
wives were available, and they would only stay till they
had pilfered all they wanted ; in addition to which none

“During the time I was in Gallegos, war was
threatened between Argentina and Chili. The disputed
territory was billy 60 miles away. It was a time of great
excitement. Soldiers drilled daily hack and front of my
house, beginning at 2 a.to. —the days were long and there
was little darkness at night ; the pigeons were taken out
and trained, and the wildest rumours prevailed. Ohilenos
were openly arrested in the streets and locked up, and l
was frankly to)d that unless .we had our passports Will
would be imprisoned. He was away and I was alone- he
was fifty miles off at Estancia Condor, initiating machine
shearing at the station. There was no direct mail to him,
and if I wanted to telephone or telegraph 1 would have
to do so via Chili, as the lines ran to and from runta
Arenas, and when Chili chose that we should get news of
the negotiations she opened the lines ; when she Qian D
choose she closed them. _ . , . ..
“ We had no Consul, but the English officials in the
Chilian English Bank swore to defend the bank and the
English women with their lives. There were afewro -
beries, and I slept every night with an axe, two or tnre
carving knives, and a siren whistle under my pi o ,
some of my pupils impressing upon me never to open my
door at night, should a knock come, till I knew who was
outside. Indeed, I was thought to be a phenomenal
woman to live alone and not be afraid. I wasn t atraia,
but I was mightily excited, and terribly anxious for tne
future. We had weeks of this, every few days bringing
news of mobilisation of troops first on one side anfl then
on the other. Our hope was that negotiations would go
on till snow fell in the Andes, when the passes—tneie
were only two —would be closed, and in the meantime
might get a man-of-war from the Falklands. Remem be ,
we were living amongst peoples only semi-eivihzed, an
of whom three parts were of Indian n „
never kept a revolver in the town, though 1 na
offered me. It is an awful thing to kill a man, and down
there unless vou kill it is useless shooting, and 1 w ° ul “"
dare to kill! My husband, too, was considered naa
because he did not carry a knive, not even when over
machines at Condor, where he had all the nation.
under him, and not one but was armed. , ...
“ For many reasons I liked living in Patagonia, *
cold was too severe—not the degree of cold, hut tn
combined with the wind. The wind gets in ever> •
I have been three days (on the edge of the Painpa) .. -,. .
to get the irons hot enough to iron, and burning „
coal all the time; and water dropped on the floor in»|)
kitchen froze at once. In the poorer houses the .
formed frost on the blankets, and I have h a d ic
eighth of an inch thick day and night on the msia,
bedroom window. As I sat governessing on the Estanma
my breath formed frost flowers on the scho ,
window, and the room stood at 32 degrees ana a
under. This with a kerosene-heater in the room.
“ After fourteen months of Patagonia we ie
Buenos Aires, and in March, 1902, left B.A. for

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ballade of a Mystery.
So’omon, the king, long past and gone,
Said : * ‘ There are four things bewilder me:
The way of a snake on a path of stone ;
The way of a ship on the trackless sea;
Then the way of an eagle—these three
Put the lamp of the sage in the shade,
And the fourth (it is odd, you’ll agree)
Is the way of a man with a maid.”
When a glance has the power to shock,
And a thrill in a smile there be ;
While the sweep and the scent of a frock
Make one swim in sweet ecstasy;
When a tear dropped artfully
Makes the heart of the bravest afraid.
There’s a problem the dullest must see
In the way of a man with a maid.
But the ways of Jenny with Jock
Are a lock with a different key;
Think how Essex was sent to the block
Back in the seventeenth century,
And there’s many another than he
Who for longing and loving has paid;
And the noose is too often the fee
For the way of a man with a maid.
Love, O Love ! what we suffer for thee,
Yet we dote on the jilt and the jade,
And the spice of the risk is a plea
For the way of a man with a maid.

A Face in the Street.
Only a face in the street,
Haunting me many a day ;
Passed on the wave of the crowd
Out where the noises are loud,
Out where the hurrying feet
Pause not or stay.
Only a face in the street,
Such as the angels have had.
Fair like the gold of the corn,
Waved by the winds of the morn ;
Eyes that were wondrously sweet —
Proud and yet sad.
Only a face in the street.
Haunting me many a day ;
Passing and vanished and gone.
Swiftly the crowd hurried on.
O ily a face in the street—
Fair as the May.

Come and Have a Drink.
Life is long and most unhappy
With its constant woes and owes,
And the ancient Problem fattens
As it old and older grows.
There is little left to keep us
From the suicidal brink
But the welcome invitation,
“ Come along and have a drink.”
First comes bold young Miss Ambition
With the warm, seductive arms—
“ Up, brave youth, we go together ”
(Oh, the glory of her charms).
Years of fruitless adoration
Make you stand aside and think :
“Seems a case of breach of promise—
Better go and have a drink.”
Secondly, the Lady happens—
Usual lady, soul and eyes—
She, of course, will solve the Problem—
Fact, herself is life’s first prize.
Then the Problem yawns and stretches,
Tips an age-worn, crafty wink,
Says, “ The best solution current
Is to cut and have a drink.”
Last, a reckless-looking party
Hands his card in branded “ Chance,”
“I,” he says, “will beat this Problem ;
I’m the moulder of romance.”
Cheerfully you back his schemings—
Just as cheerfully they sink
Till the last, lean shilling’s vanished—
Not enough to have a drink.
No, the Problem is the victor—
It was issued out of Hell,
And the answer will be written
When they ring the Judgment bell.
Leave it to my lord the Devil,
Let him mould it link by link—
Shake the wrinkles from your forehead—
Time we had another drink.

When We No More Know.
Who can say what the end will be?
Who can guess how the game will go ?
Dust to dust at the last for me,
Earth to earth when I no more know.
O’er my grave, wherever it be,
The rains will fall and the winds will blow ;
What will it matter then to me
Where I’m laid, when I no more know ?
Men may say and think what they will—
I’ll be out of their ebb and flow;
I’ll have done with the good and ill—
Done for aye—when I no more know.
Then why reck of a taunt or two,
True to myself as I come and go ?
Life will carry me safely through,
And Death is sweet—when we no more know !

Tf)e Finger Post to Health
This is an Interesting Story
for Liver Sufferers.
The case of
Mr. G. HEATHCOTE.
(BY a special reporter.)
Since enlightened humanity requires that
the trials incidental to sickness should be
minimised wherever possible, and since by
kindliness and consideration much can be
done in that direction, a reporter called
upon Mr. George Heathcote, of Surry-
street, Waterloo, who willingly assented
to answer any questions.
“ Were you once a resident of Bunda-
berg, Queensland ? ” asked the pressman.
“Yes,” answered Mr. Heathcote. “I
was living there when it was necessary to
cross the bridge by boat instead of walking
over it, or, to be more explicit, during the
time of the great flood, and it was during
that exciting and disastrous period that my
blood was so impoverished through exces-
sively hard work for long hours at a stretch
that sores broke out on my hands and arms,
and my legs swelled terribly. Previous to
this I had suffered from fever and ague,
which left me very weak and shaky, and
for some weeks I noticed that my appetite
was falling off; but I put that down to
fatigue more than anything else, until other
symptoms cropped up to show me it was
not so, but my liver and kidneys which
were responsible.”
“ What reasor were there to enable you
to arrive at that conclusion ? ”
“ Any number of them, one of the most
unmistakable being a nasty pain which
caught me here (Mr. Heathcote indicated
the part affected by placing his hand on the
small of his back). My back ached so in-
tensely that my wife made flannel belts for
me to wear, thinking that they would afford
me some relief. If I was doing anything
which caused me to bend down, the pain on
straightening myself was something terrible,
while walking also provoked great distress
and inconvenience. Other proof that my
kidneys were in a bad way was also in
evidence, and as for the rest of my ail-
ments—well, I hardly know where to begin
first.”
“ Tell me a few of the most important—
those that are uppermost in your mind ? “
“ Oh ! I have not forgotten any of them,”
was the quick response, “especially the
heavy feelings in my chest, which made me
short-winded. After eating, a weighty sen-
sation appeared in that quarter, and before
I knew where I was my stomach began
swelling out with wind, which made me
very uncomfortable always, and at times
gave rise to sharp, cutting pains. The
sour gases gradually worked their way up,
and caused me to belch, after which, and
until I took a little more food, I felt
slightly easier, but the same unpleasantness
followed each meal, however trifling. When
making my morning preparations for work
I used to feel as if I would like to go back
to bed again, as I was entirely devoid of
energy, and had no desire to attempt any-
thing. This languidness was due, no doubt,
to the restlessness every night. I could go
to bed feeling so drowsy that my eyes
seemed swollen for the want of rest, yet I
found myself awake the greater part of the
night, and when I got up my limbs were
all aches. Nearly every day I was dis-
tracted with intense headaches? which ap-
peared to bring a mist before iny eyes, as
if my sight was failing me, and without any
warning my head became so giddy that I
had to take a rest till the sensation passed
away. Every month I was getting weaker
and more wretched, being continually be-
set with pains under my shoulder-blades,
which travelled right through to the heart,
and caused me considerable anxiety The
white coating on my tongue explained the
unhealthy condition of my stomach, too,
and what I wanted was a real good medicine
to clear away all disorders and impurities ;
but in those days I did not know as much
as I do now, or I would have been out of
my troubles very quickly. I went from
bad to worse, and had arrived at that
melancholy and desperate stage when the
least and most simple thing excites a feeling
of irritation, and I am sure you will admit
that such a life of misery is not worth en-
during. Had I gone on a little longer in
that sorry plight I question whether I
would have been as sound a man as I am
to-day, for I was fairly in the grip of my
complaint, when, owing to the recollection
of some conversations between a few of my
friends, I hit upon the idea of taking some
Clements Tonic. I took immediate action,
as I firmly believed that further delay
would have brought irretrievable disaster
to my constitution.”
“ Your good fortune came at a very ac-
ceptable time, I should imagine ’ ”
“ Yes ; and a very critical time, too, and
I regretted that I had not bought a few
bottles of Clements Tonic at the outset;
but we all have to buy our experience, you
know, although I intend doing all I can to
help other sufferers by letting them know
what Clements Tonic can do. Personally,
I can truthfully say that it generally re-
vived me from my lethargic state when I
had drank but a small quantity, and I found
myself rapidly improving. Clements Tonic
had a magical effect on my kidneys and
greatly relieved the pains about my back
and shoulders. This relief, coupled with
the abatement of my headaches, had the
effect of making me feel more restful at
nights, and the sound sleep I got through
using Clements Tonic did me an immense
amount of good. My slumber was not in-
terfered with by dreams, and when I awoke
at the usual time for getting up I arose with
alacrity and hastened to my morning meal,
after which I was ready for work. It was
a marvellous change to be full of energy
and cheerfulness again, but the invigorating
properties of Clements Tonic were so re-
markable that I could not have restrained
my feelings of joy had I wanted to. Wind
never formed in my stomach after Clements
Tonic got to work, neither did my chest
trouble me, while in the matter of palpita-
tion the same medicine was equal to the
prevailing requirements. There is no
denying the fact that Clements Tonic
was wonderfully effective as a blood
purifier, for the sores were gradually
effaced from my hands and arms, and the
cause of my legs swelling—whatever that
cause might have been—was entirely re-
moved. My illness had considerably
affected my nerves, which became shaky
whenever I was disturbed, but to my heart-
felt thankfulness I must say that Clements
Tonic was as effective on my nervous
system as it was on my other deranged
organs.'
“ What was your appetite like then ? "
“As it was soon after commencing on
Clements Tonic—very good, indeed, and it
has remained so ever since. But the
strengthening qualities of my newly-found
medicine surprised me, for although my
work was very heavy I always got through
it without feeling any ill effects from the
time Clements Tonic cured me, and I have
not once had the faintest return of any of
my old symptoms, in acknowledgment of
which I give you permission to publish my
story as it pleases you.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Georor Heathcotb, of Surry-street, Water-
loo, in the State of New South Wales,

to live, and that it contains and is a true and faithful
account of my illness and cure by Clements Tonic,
and also contains my full permission to publish in any

without receiving any payment; and I make this
solemn declaration conscientiously believing the
same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of

Wore a Torture
BELT.
SUFFERED TERRIBLE AGONY.
From wearing an Electric Belt
charged by the use of
SULPHURIC 71GID.
Mr. W. Folley, Alfred Woollen Mills,
Williamstown, Vic., writing to tlie Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt Co., tells how he
was scarred and burned by the use of a
Free Belt, which he had erroneously
been led to believe was as good as theirs.
He paid £4 for the Free Belt because
he had been convinced that by paying
this cash price he was obtaining a similar
appliance to Dr. McLaughlin’s Famous
rejuvenator which has gained Worl<d
Wide fame as a Curative Agent. It goes
to show how misleading are advertise-
ments which seem to offer something for
nothing.
Gentlemen —In answer to your kind in-
quiries after my health, I beg to state that
I have been completely cured of the Scia-
tica that has troubled me for years. I
cannot thank you enough for your gentle-
manly treatment and fair dealing with your
patients, as I know from others that their
treatment has been the same as mine.
I may just as well let you know my ex-
perience in seeking a cure for my trouble
before I purchased one of your High Grade
Belts. I had been under doctors and re-
ceived scant relief; and also tried various
quacks, but it was all the same. I then
placed myself in the hands of a Specialist
(in Melbourne) guaranteed to cure Rheu-
matism and Sciatica, but received very
small benefit from the treatment. I then
had my attention drawn to Electricity.
Well, I thought, “ Never venture, never
win,” so I PROCURED first of all a Belt
for £1 and was very much disappointed
because I was informed that it was neces-
sary to take a long and exceedingly ex-
pensive course of drug treatment. I would
not do this and then I wrote for, and ob-
tained a so-called Free Belt, with a
most “ Wonderful Pedigree,” at a cost of
£4. I wore the Belt according to the in-
structions given faithfully for a period of
five weeks, and by that time I was Burnt
and Blistered so badly that I could not
wear it longer, and still no relief was
gained, although the Belt was guaranteed
to Cure Anything in Sciatica in One
Month. You bet I was very much dis-
couraged in regard to Electric Belts.
However, I was persuaded to come and
just see you, gentlemen. I then found
that I had been wearing a Torture Belt
and very Wrongly Applied, and quite
enough to give and patient a Horror of
so-called Electric Belts. After the con-
sultation I decided to place myself in your
hands. I knew my case was very diffi-
cult, as I was compelled to follow my em-
ployment, and standing at the vice was
irksome, and the complaint was a very
stubborn one. However, gentlemen, your
Belt, coupled with your advice, has made
me a grateful patient. I thank you kindly
for supplying me with a remedy which has
Completely Cured Me, and strongly recom-
mend it to all and sundry that I find are
suffering from the distressing malady
called “ Sciatica.”
I have not been wearing the Belt for the
past fortnight, but have passed it over to
my wife, who has received great benefit
for nervous troubles.
I remain, your grateful patient,
W. FOLEEY

The big success which Ruberoid Roofing has achieved in every part of the civilised world could

The Federal Capital.
It was in some measure unfortunate that the
Australian Federation was not cradled in time of
war or other great national stress. The easy and
comfortable conditions under which the union
came to birth—the only difficulty being the petty
and undignified one of soothing the squabbling
jealousies of various provincialists—deprived the
new nation of much that would have been valuable
in forming a character. Australia began federated
life too much under hothouse conditions. The
evil effects of this have shown themselves on
various occasions, but never so conspicu-
ously as in the discussion as to the location of
the Federal capital. From many sides comes a
clamor against a “bush capital,” and plaintive
arguments as to the “discomfort” and “incon-
venience” to legislators if the Federal Par-
liament sits anywhere outside Melbourne or
Sydney. In other quarters, whilst there is a
grudging acquiescence to the proposal that the
Legislature should move away from the fleshpots
of the great cities, there is an eager desire to veto
any proposed site which has real or fancied
hardships of climate or access. The time has
come to remark to those gentlemen of the
Federal Parliament who are desirous of
staying in one of our great cities, and to
those who are so querulously anxious that
a site should be ciiosen with prompt access by
Pullman car and with a soft and complaisant
climate, that the whole purpose of the Federation
is not to provide comfortable hotel quarters for
those who chance now to be its legislators. The
Bulletin wishes to say this firmly, if a little reluc-
tantly. This paper has never joined in that cheap
and nasty adulteration of Radicalism which seeks
the favor of the unthinking by belittling the repre-
sentatives of the people and attacking their so-
called “fat salaries ’ and ‘‘enormous perquisites.”
That is a Tory game to cripple the service of the
public so that the public may be the more easily
victimised. But, whilst Australia should give
the best that it can to its Parliament and
Ministers, concession must stop short of
keeping back the development of the nation
in the interests of the marble bath and the
civilised cocktail of the Legislature. So soon as
these things can be provided, consistently with
the national interests, they should be ; the legis-
lator is worthy of his bath and his cocktail. But
if the nation needs it, the Legislature should be
content with a bullock-dray capital. It must be
the nation’s interests first and those of the nation’s
s ervants second.
* * * *
It is ridiculous to hear, as one may hear, mem-
bers of the Federal Parliament arguing that the
Bombala site for the capital—the only truly
national site so far proposed—is impossible,
because, for a while, members would have to
travel some of the distance by coach, and
because the climate there is sometimes cold.
This is an old woman attitude. These “ dainty
affetuosos” who would sacrifice a nation’s in-
terests rather than submit to a little jolting or an
occasional sharp blast of wind, show themselves in
a wholly contemptible light. It is their misfortune
perhaps, rather than their fault, that such paltry
ideas should infect their minds. The daily papers,
With their draper souls, constantly preach paltri-
ness ini cowardice in national affairs, and there
has been in Australia of late no stirring deed to
rouse the mind from sluggishness. Federation
was born in peddling times. The very capital site
location was made matter of degraded huckstering
by George Reid. Eureka and the Anti-trans-
portation movement are far remote from these
days, and the spirit aroused by those great out-
bursts of national feeling has, to a great extent,
faded way. Else it would be impossible for an
Australian public man to balance against the
arguments in favor of a truly national Federal site
his personal liability to catch a cold in his nose.
• • * *
Ignoring the cold-in-the-nose issue, the con-
ditions which a locality must satisfy to make it
truly suitable for an Australian capital may be
briefly recapitulated as follows :
The area must be the sole property of the Federation,
and must be sufficiently large to secure for the Australian
people all the increment in land values which the build-
ing of the capital will give. An area of 100 square miles
would be inadequate even for the building of a city ; and
it would leave the larger share of land value increments
to the private landlords outside the area. Greater
Melbourne has an area of 250 square miles, and
that area by no means embraces all the land which
has largely increased in value by the mere building
of the city. If an area of 100 square miles, dedicated
tor a Federal city, were an exact square, and the city
were built in its exact middle, it would only be a distance
of five miles from the Federal G.P.O. to some private
landlord’s area. If, as it is more reasonable to suppose, this
exact mathematical regularity were not obtainable, it
might be only half a mile from the Federal city to the
outside area where the private landlord annexed the
profits.
The area must be of such a character as to permit of a
real city arising, with good agricultural lands contiguous,
with room and facilities for factories and arsenals. Either
an easy coal supply or water power must be available.
A bracing and sturdy climate is desirable. The Federal
area should be a nursery for the Federal soldiers and
Bailors and public servants.
A Federal port is absolutely essential. The present
humiliating tribute agreement with Britain cannot be
endured for ever. In time the Commonwealth must have
its own navy ; it will then want its own dockyards and
harbor. Further, the Federal capital should not be sur-
rounded on all sides by the area of any one State, and be
dependent solelv on that State for its means of communi-
cation.
Of the various sites under consideration there is
only one that meets all these requirements—the
Eden-Bombala area. In view of the necessity for
economy—the Commonwealth cannot very well
buy up Newcastle and the Hunter River valley—
it is probably the only site available in the whole
Commonwealth. And it answers to the natural
needs in a fashion almost absolutely complete.
An area can be secured stretching from an excel-
lent harbor on the coast towards fine, bracing high-
lands, where might be bred men who could beat
Maorilanders at football or steal cattle from a High-
lander of the 16th century. Railway communi-
cation with the great State capitals can be effected
without any enormous difficulty. There is a
splendid water-supply—the only really genuine
hall-marked, never-failing Australian river, the
Snowy, passes through the land, and water for
every requirement, from the generation of elec-
trical power for running factory machinery to the
dilution of the politician’s whisky, is available. It
is fitted, by reason of its cheap water power, to be
the greatest and most economical manufacturing
site in Australia—water is even cheaper than coal.
A harbor suitable for the naval and trade necessi-
ties of a Federal capital is in existence. There need
be no cramping of the area resumed, as 5000 square
miles, of mostly Crown lands, can be obtained.
On the Eden-Bombala site, in short, the Federa-
tion may found a city and a State which will
serve every national purpose, and wield a great
influence in breaking down those provincial
jealousies which are the chief obstacles to the pro-
gress of the Union.
• • • •
The question is a national and not a provincial
one. No member of the Australian Parliament
should consider New South Wales, Victorian, or
other State interests in coming to a decision.
Still less should he give a thought to his own per-
sonal predilections and weaknesses. The national
outlook is the only worthy one—an outlook not
confined to a generation, or even a century, but far-
seeing enough to take into consideration the great
possible future of this continent and of its Federal
Government. The question as to whether a little
bit of huckstering trade will go to, or be taken
away from, the merchants of Melbourne or Sydney
is one which cannot enter into the decision, with-
out treachery to Australia. The fear that a
national and economical site will necessarily be at
first a little remote from the big cities, a little
difficult of access, a little wanting in the higher
luxuries of civilisation, is one that can only in-
fluence the cowardly and the selfish ; the man
who would betray his country for the sake
of enjoying a little comfort on a velvet otto-
man is such a cheap traitor that he can’t
be conceded to have even the business acu-
men of a Judas. Members of the Australian
Parliament already make very great sacrifices in
attending to their duties, as they receive allow-
ances far too low to adequately compensate them
for their business losses. It would be very pitiful
if, after suffering serious inconveniences cheer-
fully, they should, on the deathbed of the first
Parliament, sacrifice the national interests in a
matter of the very highest importance for the sake
of an extra hour in a sleeping-car, in deference
to some provincial jealousy, or for any other
paltry personal or political reason. The Bulletin
in particular appeals to the Labor party to stand
to the national and patriotic attitude on this great
issue. That party has, so far, shown itself the
most consistently Federal and Australian of the
three organisations in the Parliament; it would
be a fitting crown to its work in the first Aus-
tralian Legislature if it were to stand unitedly for
the national, as opposed to the provincial, or the
personally selfish, view in the selection of the
national capital.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Civil Service Testimonial Cadge.
An estimable gentleman named Maynard is
retiring from a well-paid billet in N.S.W. Publio
Instruction Department, to spend his declining
years in reasonable affluence, and the usual
committee of highly placed busybodies has set to
work to practically blackmail the ill-paid sub-
ordinate employees of small sums to make up the
usual testimonial. The same old cadging circular
has gone out, but with extra-special impudence
the circular this time suggests the amount that
each employee is expected to give- so much from
the public servant with a salary of £150, and so
on according to a sliding scale. Many of the
people thus circularised never saw Mr. Maynard.
Some of them hardly heard of him in all their
lives. None of them, probably, reckons that
he or she is under any special obligations to him.
The writer of this has, at various times, when
some similar cadge was in progress, interviewed
civil servants—principally teachers and country
employees—and has found these to be very
common opinions on the subject:—
(1) That the habit of organising testimonials to depart-
ing high functionaries is sedulously kept up by high
functionaries who have not yet departed, so that the pre-
cedent may hold good when they leave the service in
their turn. In other words, the Jones who gets up a
testimonial to Smith to-day is credited with doing it for
the sordid purpose of getting his own testimonial to-
morrow. .....
(2) That the man or woman who doesn’t submit to this
petty tyranny and give his or her half-crown to the
rich boss, is marked down for punishment and petty
annoyance.
(3) That the chiefs of the service regard this process of
levying a tax on ill-paid subordinates, who can never hope
to get any testimonial themselves, as an unofficial means of
adding to their incomes, akin to the Chinese boss-man-
darin’s habit of exacting bribes from his inferior officials.
The service may be taking too harsh a view.of the
case, but that is the view a large section of it does
take. When a man who is in authority, or who is
supposed to represent someone in authority,
suggests to a poor subordinate that he should give
2s. 6d. to someone who has long been his cnief
boss, and who may still influence the course of
events, the subordinate naturally assumes that it
is safer to pay, however seriously he may feel the
loss of the 2s. 6d. He assumes that the influential
people who are running the cadge must want
2s. fid. very badly ; that they are liable to be dis-
appointed and infuriated if they don’t get it; that
if they are infuriated they may use their power to
do him injury. In his own mind he probably
regards them as mean blackmailers and not many
degrees higher than petty thieves, also as crawl-
some persons who are trying to earn somebody’s
gratitude by extracting petty sums from the poor
for his benefit; but, on the other hand, be con-
siders that, just as he parts his 2s. 6d. in order to
avoid offending them, they may also be in the
painful position of having to collect the 2s. 6d. in
order to avoid offending somebody else. And if
the view taken by the man who thus parts with one
of his scarce half-crowns is at all unfair, it can
only be said that tbe men who run the cadge
deserve to be thus viewed. They shouldn’t look
mean and grovelsome and mercenary and abject,
and then they wouldn’t be considered so. They
shouldn’t beg, and then they wouldn’t be regarded
as beggars. They shouldn’t cadge from people
they may be able to injure, and then they wouldn’t
be suspected of a tendency to injure those people
if the cadge isn’t responded to. And if they
haven’t sense enough to realise the situation and
cease cadging, Parliament ought to prohibit the
whole cadging system.

Senator De Largie’s “ Freetrade Tariff.”
Senator De Largie, of Westralia, has apparently
some curious ideas on fiscalism. He seriously
suggests that a fiscal referendum should be taken
on these four issues :
Protectionist tariff.
Freetrade tariff.
Protectionist revenue tariff.
Freetrade revenue tariff,
Three of these things are reasonably understand-
able, but tbe fourth is a contradiction in terms —
it is a live corpse, and a horse marine, and a tall
dwarf, and a pale European negro from Central
Africa. A Protectionist tariff, pure and simple,
is understandable. It means a tariff which is
designed solely to promote local industries ; and
when it achieves its purpose to the full, it will
yield no customs revenue at all, for the things
which can’t be produced here won’t be taxed, and
the things which can be produced here, and which
are taxed, won’t be imported. A Protectionist
revenue tariff is moderately understandable. It
presumably means a tariff in which Protectionist
duties are not so high as to stop imports, but
are only calculated to reduce them and to encourage
local production up to a certain point; also a tariff
which, in addition to its Protectionist duties,
includes some duties imposed for purely revenue
purposes on goods which can’t be locally produced.
A Freetrade revenue tariff is easy enough of com-
prehension. That implies a tariff in which certain
imports are taxed for revenue purposes with
exactly equal excise duties on similar articles of
local make, whereby the country secures revenue,
and at the same time enjoys all the alleged bless-
ings of free competition. If the excise duties are
not equal to the customs duties, then, to the
extent of the difference, tbe alleged curse of
Protection creeps in. But as for a Freetrade
tariff as distinguished from a Freetrade revenue
tariff there is no such thing—it is in the same
category as bears’ eggs and tbe famous Mrs.
Harris. Senator De Largie should _ try to
struggle out of bis state of mental confusion, and
explain what he is driving at.
A Chance for Reid.
The Sydney Importers’ papers have labored
heavily to prove that it was the duty of ex-Pre-
mier Barton to remain in politics and fight next
election, because G. H. Reid promised to oppose
him then at the Hunter. Apart from the facts
that it is pretty certain Reid would never have
made the promise but for his conviction that
Barton would not be in politics at next election,
and that he wouldn’t keep the promise if Barton
did remain in politics, there is something very
large and beautiful in the theory that the world
must stop short to wait George Reid’s conveni-
ence. The Importers’ party has certainly a rather
High opinion of the tonnage of its dancing clown,
but it is straining things a little to assume that
when Reid issues his comic challenge and waves
his dog in the air the other party must hang up
all other matters in order to meet him, or be for
ever disgraced. Anyhow, even if Barton is out
of the way, George need not despair. His quarrel
was not with Barton personally, but with tbe
head of the Protectionist Ministry. Alfred
Deakin is that head now, and there is nothing at
all to prevent Reid giving up his East Sydney
seat and fighting Premier Deakin next December
at Ballarat, which is almost as large a constituency
as tbe one Reid now represents. Of course, if he
didn’t really mean to oppose Barton, or if be only
meant to do it under the impression that Barton’s
seat was one he could capture without any
risk, lie will not attack Deakin ; but otherwise
there is every reason why he should. He pro-
fesses to want to fight the Protectionist Premier
of Australia, and Deakin is the man. And the
opportunity would be a glorious one to carry the
war into the enemy’s country, to snatch a seat
from the Protectionists, and to prove the reality
of that great Freetrade revival in Victoria, which
Reid has so often declared to exist. Also there
would be no question of deserting N.S.W. in any
material sense. Reid, of Ballarat, could see that
justice was done to N.S.W. quite as well as Reid
of East Sydney. In fact, N.S.W. would prac-
tically gain an extra member by the change.
The Labor Platform.
Few things are calculated to make any progressive
Australian feel sadder than the Federal and State
Labor platform as published regularly in the Labor
papers. It is such a fine platform at the beginning
and so miserably incompetent at the end. It
demands a legal minimum vvage, which is a good
thing—and which will raise the cost of production.
It asks for shorter hours which, when the wages
are not shortened to correspond, must also increase
the cost of production. ] t seeks for many things
which improve the condition of the people—and
m so doing raise the cost of production. And
certainly the cost of production should be raised—
in every case it should be raised high enough to
enable the work of production to pay decent
wages, allow decent hours, let the workman live
under decent conditions, and yet give the
employer a fair return. And with it all the
Labor party still states that it will sink the
fiscal issue, and allow itself to be represented by
Freetraders provided they accept its terms and
conditions. What is the good of a Freetrader
accepting any such terms and conditions? He
may vote for good wages, but, if he gets wages
fixed at a respectable figure by law, then, under
Freetrade, the foreign low-wage man gets the busi-
ness. He may help to get it enacted that the
Australian shall not work more than eight hours,
and then, under Freetrade, the foreigner who
works 12 hours gets the business. It is impossible
to"get short hours and good wages without raising
the cost of production—and then, under Freetrade,
the cheap foreign producer gets the business. If
tbe Labor programme is carried with Freetrade
attached thereto, it will bemuch worse for Australia
than if there had never been any Labor programme,
and the out-and-out Freetrade Labor member is a
worse enemy to Labor than Dobson, or Simon
Fraser, or Bruce Smith, or any of their kind.
Under a Dobson Freetrade regime the Australian
people, by dint of working long hours for low
wages, would still be able to live—in a kind of a
way. Under a Labor Freetrade regime they
would be prohibited from working long hours for
low wages, and they wouldn’t, through the com-
petition of cheap foreigners, get any work at all.
All the book platitudes in the world won’t alter
the fact that high wages and short hours mean an
increase in the cost of production, unless they are
counterbalanced by unusual and quite exceptional
skill, which the Australian certainly doesn’t
possess. The Labor platform is a good thing for
ensuring that what work there is to do in
Australia shall be done under fair circumstances.
But it does nothing to provide that there will be
work to do, under fair conditions or any other
conditions. At present Australia imports so
much and makes so little that there isn’t nearly
enough work for its people to do, and Freetrade
will increase the imports so that there will be less
work. Then there will remain—the platform,
which isn’t eatable nor wearable, which, without
the work to do, is only loose eloquence, theory,
language, ink, and well-meaning drivel.
—■ 4
The Victorian Factories Bill.
With loud professions that they desire to suppress
sweating, the Victorian employers are just now
engaged in a bitter fight against the new Factories
Bill. This paradoxical attitude only serves to
show what strange means some folk adopt in order
to prove their sincerity. They rank with that
genius in explanation who fired at a French Pre-
sident and explained that he only did it to draw
attention to anew method of stuffing flock mat-
tresses. The employers who hate sweating have
persistently opposed all suggested legislation for
its eradication. Before the advent of Federation
the Victorian Chamber of Sweaters used to
declare, “Give us any other means of putting
down sweating than the Factories Act and we
will support it.” Some of them and their press
heelers went so far as to advocate Arbitration in
preference to a Factories Act. The Federal Par-
liament came along with an Arbitration Bill,
and the employers rose in arms against it.
Now their own Irvine comes down with a
very much modified Factories Bill and the
employers are against it also. Apparently
the employers, when they say they are against
sweating, are telling one of those undiluted lies
sanctioned by the murky-faced goddess of “trade.”
It is the same kind of bald lie as is told by the
jam-maker who sells mangel-wurzels, turnips,
carrots, and vegetable marrows as “purest fruit
jams,” or by the meat-packer who sells twelve
ounces for a pound. “ Trade ” seems to be a sort
of hothouse in which the weeds of lying and
deceit flourish exceedingly. No lie, no meanness
is too colossal to bolster up a trade deal or to
hinder legislation designed to protect the public
from the tricks of employers. Although fac-
tories legislation has been on the statute-books of
Victoria for seven years or more, the Employers’
Federation sent a deputation to Chief Secretary
Murray to request that the present Bill should
expire in December, 1904, in order to give
the wildly novel idea a trial. In order
to have a free hand to exploit boy and
girl labor, the employers also asked that
no restrictions should be placed on the
number of boys and girls working in factories.
Here again the request was supported with an
unvarnished lie. The deputationists urged that
under the present system of fixing a proportion of
boys and girls to men and women in factories the
young people were excluded from learning trades.
When the employers had absolute freedom, before
Factories Acts were dreamed of, it is a notorious
fact that fewer boys and edrls were taught trades
than now. Boys and girls were then taken
on for a few months, without wages, by different
employers in turn, and then dismissed as
being unsuited. Further, the employers want
to exclude all men over 55 years of age and all
women over 45 years of age from the operation of
the Act. They want this done for the benefit of the
men and women themselves. The compassion of
these employers for the old and slow worker is stag-
gering. During the course of the deputation it was
strenuously denied that “ reputable
paid sweating wages. Assertions of that kind
recall the fact that it was said “reputable firms
did not diddle the customs revenue until it was
proved otherwise. As the employers could get no
satisfaction out of Murray, they put up Swin-
burne, the tall, lank advocate of freedom of
contract, to move a number of amendments
on the Bill in the Legislative Assembly, lo
the credit of a rather Tory House it has to be
said that the amendments w.ere rejected with
scorn. It is expected, however, that the sweaters
will have better luck in the House of 48 Rich
Landlords.
♦
The Rump Ministry.
The method of reconstruction of the Federal
Cabinet augurs ill for its fate at the general
elections. “A Ministry of rehabilitated frag-
ments,” Josiah Symon has dubbed the recon-
structed Administration, and it deserves the sneer.
As an entity, it is 25 per cent, below the average
of ability of the Legislature, and includes men who
would he too much honored by a seat m a state
Cabinet. Yet Premier Deakin had an absolutely
free hand in making changes. When his prede-
cessor resigned, the whole Ministry
him ; and Alfred Deakin, having been sent
for,” was empowered to choose whomsoever he
listed. He might have arranged with Kingston to
return to the Cabinet, and there were available
such men as Isaacs, Higgins, Symon, and possibly
J. C. Watson and B. R. Wise (the last is credited


with an intention to enter the Australian Parlia-
ment). There was no need whatever to re-appoint
J.ohn Forrest, who is quite out of place in a
democratic combination; or Fysh, who is old and
harmless; or even Drake. By retaining these,
and adding Chapman, who never was strong
enough for even a State portfolio, and Playford,
who is better than Chapman but yet none too
good, Premier Deakin seems to have deliberately
sought for a Ministry of colorless political respec-
tability. Apparently he was guided to some
extent by the foolish old parochial idea that it
was necessary to share the portfolios out in
certain proportions among the States regard-
less of personal fitness, and it is a painful
commentary on the weakness of the N.S.W.
delegation that, outside the Labor party, there
was only one better man than Chapman who
could have been selected ; and that man — Ewing
—didn’t belong, in the strictest sense of the term,
to the Bill Lyne circle, or represent any place in
the vicinity of Lyne’s electorate. Certainly it
was impossible to offer a portfolio to Wilks,
or anybody of his calibre. All the same,
if the parochial policy of sharing port-
folios out geographically makes it necessary to
take in Chapman rather than Isaacs, and to
retain Fysh and Forrest and Drake ; and if the
doctrines of bell-topperdom makes it impossible
to take in Watson or Hughes ; and if the theory
of being moderate and colorless and affable and
trying to please everybody shuts out restless,
active men like Kingston who want to
do things—then it is difficult to see that
Deakin could have done better. Assuming
that what he wants is a restful Govern-
ment that is pretty well content with things as
they are, that is elderly and accustomed to go to
Government House, and that is nicely divided
among the States, then he has got what he wants.
If he is in search of a strong, progressive demo-
cratic Government, then he has found as bad a
sample as could well be imagined. It only
requires to get rid of George Turner to be all
mediocrity; Turner is the one landmark of
statesmanship left. The dominating force of the
Cabinet is now the big, loud, aggressively-Tory
John Forrest, and the steersman who dodges a
wav among the snags of personal animosity
is Bill Lyne. Possibly, in getting his
nonentities together, Premier Deakin intended
to wait for guidance until the general elections
were over. Then if the Tory cause is successful
at the polls, the Forrest influence will dominate
the Cabinet. If the democratic cause prevails,
Bill Lyne will be entrusted with the task
of winning back the Labor party, and the Ministry
will be as progressive as you please, and as its
limited knowledge of what constitutes progress
will admit. But a Ministry which has lost King-
ston and O’Connor, and which hasn’t lost Lyne
and Forrest and Drake, and which has found
Chapman, will probably not live to receive any
instructions at the polls except instructions to
resign.
♦
The Federal High Court.
The Federal High Court, as constituted, commands
respect for its high ability, whilst imparting un-
easiness at the fact that it is all, practically, of
the one color as regards political convictions. The
last thing that a Supreme Court Judge should be
is a politician ; once he mounts the Bench his
partizan views should vanish and all things be
looked at in the sober and equable spirit of
impartiality. But it is inevitable that a man’s
training and associations should, to some extent,
tinge his mind, however much he may strive to
clear it of all bias. Whilst Australia can con-
fidently expect of the three judges appointed an
honest effort to be strictly fair in all things, it is
probable that in the decision of those high questions
of constitutional law which merge insensibly from
law into politics, their minds will be biassed
towards that Conservative and Imperialistic view
which they have followed all their lives. There is
no chance of any one of the three becoming a
Higinbotham, or following up that great
tradition of the English Bench which often made
the Judge the chief defender of popular liberty.
Griffith, Barton and O’Connor will dispense
good law, will administer even justice so far as they
can, but they will not, it may be safely predicted, in
laying down the early precedents which will make
Australian Common Law, ever fail to stretch, a
little towards the Tory view in local affairs,
towards the CHAMBERLAIN-Imperialistic view in
external affairs. In a Bench of five Australian
Judges, The Bulletin would welcome at least
two of them ; in a Bench of three, at least one.
It does not suggest the desirability of a palpably
Radical court as an alternative to this palpably
Tory and pro-English court. But, taking the
range of selection as including Griffith, Downer,
Barton, Higgins, O’Connor, Isaacs, Symon,
Wise and A. I. CLARKfive—or three —might have
been chosen who would have blended the different
constitutional law views of Australia. Griffith,
Barton and O’Connor are Tory and-pro-English;
Clark and Higgins are democratic and pro-
Australian ; Wise, democratic and pro-English ;
Symon, _ Tory and pro-Australian. A mixture of
these views would have secured a Bench embody-
ing the happy mean. The present occupants
represent the Conservative extreme. There is
one other point of criticism. It is stated in some
quarters that Chief Justice Griffith is to retain
some right to a future pension from the State of
Queensland. The Federal Parliament should
absolutely veto any such arrangement. If Mr.
Griffith has a promise of a future Queensland
State Pension—a promise which the Queensland
-State Parliament can at any time withdraw —
and a case, comes before him as a Judge in
which the interests of the State of Queensland
are in. conflict with the interests of the
Federation, what effect the fear of the loss of
his pension would have on him may be sur-
mised from two points of view—that of lofty
confidence, and that of suspicion. The suspicious
attitude would be the general public, if not the
correct, attitude. The Commonwealth must insist
on being sole paymaster, present and prospective,
of its Judges. In N.S.W. it is thought to be an
unwise thing to promote a District Court Judge
to the Supreme Court Bench, or to make a puisne
JAstice Chief Justice, on the principle that once
appointed to the Bench a man should have nothing
to nope for in the way of promotion, as well as
nothing to fear in the way of punishment, from the
Government. The loss of Griffith’s ability would
be great; but to surround the High Court with
an atmosphere of suspicion (which would be the
effect of his presence on the Bench whilst hoping
for a State pension) would be a much more serious
matter.

The Drift of N.S.W. Assembly.
Whilst N.S.W. Assembly, hindered by factious
opposition and bogged by inept leadership,
wrangles and drivels, there is a great mass of work
waiting to be done. The business paper shows,
the following valuable reform measures, few of
which have any hope of passing this session:
Influx of Criminals Prevention Bill (a measure to pre-
vent the State being swamped by imported gaol-birds);
it wants only one stage to become an Act. There is
another Bill on the business paper to deal more effec-
tively with the habitual criminals of the State.
Forestry Bill, to put some method into the State’s deal-
ings with its timber resources.
Liquor Bill, an honest, if somewhat namby-pamby,
effort to deal with the scandals and anomalies of
the liquor traffic.
Two Water and Sewerage Bills, to allow of more effec-
tive administration of municipal works in city and
country for water supply and drainage.
Dairy Industry Bill, to impose some much-needed regu-
lation on the dairy-products export trade.
Gun License Bill—a measure which will do something
to check the sale of the pernicious pea-rifle and the
devouring revolver to the youthful and the maniacal.
Two Bills to deal with juvenile vice, and to rescue
from the streets and bad houses youngsters from whom
are recruited the criminal classes.
And half-a-score others of less importance, but
still of great importance. All these are hung up
whilst the House discusses endlessly and aimlessly
Billjim’s dirt money and the punt in the
electorate of Horseleech, M.L.A. A good deal
is the fault of the Opposition—an Opposition
which includes such freaks as Wood, Affleck,
Storey, Fitzpatrick, Levy, Jessep, and Dr.
Ross, who are physically—no truthful person can
add, mentally—capable of discussing any subject
at any length, and at any hour. Blame also
attaches to individual Ministers, some of whom
seem to revel in adding the maximum of ir-
relevancy to the minimum of courtesy in their
replies to the questions and speeches of opponents.
But the greatest censure must fall on the Govern-
ment as a body. It in no wise leads the House,
but allows the session to drift to its close without
any serious effort to do anything but fill in
time. And that’s a game which does not pay in
politics.
Maoriland’s Landless Policy.
“Kiwi” writes from God’s Country—and
Seddon’s
Now that Victoria appears to be about to embark on
the mad and potentially corrupt policy of acquiring
private estates for settlement, it may be well to point
out the effects of that system in this State. Anyone
who cares to analyse the facts must conclude that it is a
crass failure. To begin with, we imposed a land-tax
in 1891 —a very proper impost ; but a couple of
years later we started buying the very properties that
paid the most taxation, and hence, though the unearned
increment of the land of this State has advanced twenty
million pounds since then, our land tax revenue is prac-
tically stationary Meanwhile, we have not settled the
land problem by any means. The State tenants who have
been placed on the resumed areas are generally
more bigoted reactionaries than the people they
have replaced. They are growing bolder as they grow
stronger in numbers, and they are now clamoring
for the freehold, in which demand they are backed up by
the so-called Farmers’ Union. The richest squatters are
not more opposed to labor legislation than these
“cockies”; in fact, it is no exaggeration to say that
our landless policy is breeding reactionaries, who are
more dangerous, because more numerous, than the
squatters. Yet we still have many large estates. The
Parliamentary return referred to in Bulletin (13 8/’O3),
shows that there are 192 people who own each from
10,000 to 100,000 acres of land, and this coterie alone shares
among its members some four million acres. Our policy
of spending borrowed money on public works is having the
inevitable effect of enhancing the value of land. Hence
land is rapidly becoming dearer, and so we must pay
more for our purchases from year to year. To borrow
money for public works is bad enough ; but to borrow
again in order to buy our own lands at prices in-
flated by borrowing is the high-water mark of
absurdity. Meanwhile, the big squatter is feeling
more secure, for he has an army of “cockies” to fight
for him, and he doesn’t at all mind being bought out for
a good price. I have no doubt that if the Russell crowd
once got into office all the “ best” people would soon be
rid of their properties at handsome prices.. The one
effective remedy—a tax on land values —is, for the
present, lost sight of, and as an increasing number of
people become interested in the maintenance of the
present rotten system, some time will elapse before the
landless majority will realise how they are being cheated
in the name of a progressive land policy.
The Bulletin (3/9/’O3) pointed out something of
this in an article headed “Irvine’s Resumption
Scheme.” But “Kiwi” isn’t conclusive. The
new Maoriland farmers may be a bad lot, but if a
country waits before settling the people on the
land till it can get perfectly honest and unselfish
people to settle, and doesn’t start manufactures
till it can get angels to run them, or shipping till
it has evolved the perfect shipowner, it will wait
a long while. The Bulletin’s theory is this:
(1) The country should stop all borrowing, and pro-
vide its public works fund and a public debt sinking
fund (however small) out of taxation. Then it should
start buying back land, paying for it out of taxation.
Under these conditions it would not have to buy on the
inflated values created by a loan boom.
(2) It should lease the land in limited areas—not sell it.
(3) There should be a heavy graduated land-tax on
estates above the limit to hasten the process of disinte-
gration.
The idea of limiting the area would, of course,
arouse the bitter opposition of the class which
wants large estates. But it would have the sup-
port of the greater class which has no land, or
which holds areas below the limit, and which
wouldn’t want to see its chance of getting up to the
limit spoiled by the aggregation of large estates,
and a consequent land famine.
The Crown Defender—Once More.
The Victorian Letter Carriers’ Association lately
passed a resolution “that the Solicitor-General
be asked to frame legislation that, when a criminal
charge has been proved to be unfounded, the
expenses of the defence be paid by the Crown.”
Judging by recent events, the Victorian Solicitor-
General is much more likely to frame a picture of
the person who makes such a charge—especially
if she be a short-skirted damsel of nasty mind.
The resolution has, so far, met with only a stony
stare of incredulous surprise; notwithstanding
which, so long as that resolution is not given
effect to —so long, in fact, as a Government pays
a Crown Prosecutor and not a Crown Defender
—any Solicitor-General or other personage, or,
indeed, anyone at all, who prates about the
glories of British justice, the “palladium
of liberty, ” and so forth, is just talking bunkum.
Every time any Podsnap person gets on his
hindlegs and babbles of Magna Charta, “which
denies to no man justice and right,” somebody
should hit him heavily and promptly with a
brick. The blessed Law says every man is innocent
until he is proved guilty, but it takes no interest in
his ability or capacity to prove his’ innocence,
though it assists his accuser to prove him guilty to
the utmost of his power. Why the Law is afflicted
witli this crooked habit of thought not even itself
knows; at least, it has never given the slightest
sign of knowledge. Any person (even if neither an
adult nor an elector) may lay any charge—from
petty larceny to murder and sacrilege—against any
other. Until the evidence is heard, it is merely
one man’s word against another’s, yet the lop-
sided Law straightway runs one party into the
lock-up and takes no manner of thought whatever
about his innocence—it, in fact, so strongly
objects to the idea of his innocence that it even
puts all possible obstacles in his way when he
tries to prove it himself with such means as he
possesses ; while it spends its time and substance
without stint in helping the other person to prove
—not his innocence—but the first person’s guilt.
Why the Law should be so keen on convicting
someone passes comprehension. It isn’t because,
having built several costly gaols, it is desirable to
fill them, for there are large numbers of persons
whom it never dreams of imprisoning who would
look exceedingly well in gaol. It isn’t because
the conviction of an accused is profitable, for
prisoners—in Australia, at any rate —are a. very
costly luxury. It isn’t because of its innate
tendency to socialistic legislation—the Law
assisted the accuser and hampered or neglected
the accused long before socialistic legislation was
ever heard of. It can’t be because the Law deems
defending an accused highly immoral; some of
the most respected and esteemed “officers of the
court ” give nearly all their time and brains to.
defending accused persons, and the Law thinks so
mijch of these that it often makes Judges of them.
It seems to be only a habit, and it is a wasteful
and useless habit which brings the Law into con-
tempt, and throws dirt on the rabbit-skin-
bedecked robe of Justice.
An Australian “ Explorer.”
Australian exploration is as easy as shelling peas
nowadays. A Scotchman named Macdonald, who
passed through Sydney a few weeks ago, lately
came back again ; and Sydney Telegraph called
him “ an Australian explorer, ” and gave him half-
a-colurnn or so of space in which to set out the
things he found while he was away. The intrepid
adventurer, it seems, went as far as Cunnamulla,
and even a little beyond, and from there rode
down to Bourke. He didn’t wander much
outside the limit of the country that is
used for settlement, and must have been
within coo-ee of a homestead lessee’s camp
or a boundary-rider’s hut most of the time; and
certainly there are, at this moment, scores of
Australian prospectors who are ten times further
away from settlement. Yet for no other reason
than that the present person comes from England,
alleged Australian papers give this sort of
“exploration” columns of space, and brand the
man who wanders along the tracks that have
existed for at least a quarter of a century “an
Australian explorer.” And either this particular
explorer or the reporter who is alleged to have
interviewed him is a most shockingly igno-
rant person. “We found,” the explorer says,
or is alleged to say, “a great many gems
in the old beds of streams. They were sapphires
and topaz principally, as well as zircon. You
haven’t heard of that gem before, eh ? It is new.”
The zircon new ! An “explorer” comes all the
way from London to tell us that; and apparently
the Telegraph doesn’t know that Coghlan’s
“Seven Colonies” alludes to zircon and a number
of other almost valueless gems as being “ found
throughout Australasia.” It ranks with garnet
and such-like trash. And now, having found out
all these things, the explorer is “off to England to
get machinery to work deposits we have located ”
—Australia being a poor sort of place which, not
knowing what zircons are, couldn’t be expected
to be able to supply a 10-h.p. hauling engine.
Australian papers ought to hit this sort of bump-
tious person on the head ; instead, they encourage
him to be bumptious by advertising him.

The Daily Paper.
C. C. writes :
It is fairly safe to prophesy that when the new demo-
cratic daily paper arrives, the Herald-Telegraph com-
bination will lose thousands of subscribers who at present
have practically no option but to purchase one of those
calamitous mis-leaders of public opinion. A business
man must have a daily paper if only to read the market
reports, and the present writer feels deeply the hardship
of having 1 to give a penny to an organ calciilated' to in-
spire loathing and contempt;- There was a time when, by
. ignoring its leading articles, a decent man could read the
Telegraph without using profane language, but novC it is
not safe to let one’s eyes stray from the advertisements.
The present-day great Australian daily, not satisfied with
straight-out, impudent lying in its leading columns, now
distorts even the news of the day by (1) the suppression'
of awkward facts detrimental to its alleged prin-
ciples, (2) by most unfairly paraphrasing the speeches
and “ interviews ” of political opponents, (3) by cunningly
•worded innuendoes of the “ don’t duck him in the horse-
pond ” order, (4) by suggestive denials of “rumors”
having no existence—for instance, the stale trick of
announcing that “ Mr. Hardfist, the Labor candidate,
denies that he was ever the paid advocate of Anarchy and
free love.” For all these, and many other contemptible
dodges, the "leading daily” is anathema to those who
are compelled to “ support ” it because there is no choice.
The leading columns of a daily paper are recognised by
its readers as the space allotted, more orless, t o romance,
and can be “ passed ”■ as such ; but the news columns are
supposed to be a record of matters of fact, and subscribers
have a right to get the news of the day unadulterated
•with the paper’s peculiar policy. If the fact that John
Smith hanged himself at Booligal is wired to the daily
paper, we may be sad, glad, or indifferent, but we don’t
want that item, of news distorted in the attempt
to convey by innuendo that John Smith fell a victim to
the blighting influence of the Old Age Pensions Act, or
hanged himself owing to socialistic legislation. Those
who avoid that acrobatic portion of the paper have no
objection to the blighting influence of its leading columns,
hut, when we find its politics slopping all over the paper
and coloring the current news, we curse the tardy arrival
of that long-looked-for democratic daily, in which we may
relieve our pent-up feelings. It’s nearly time that we had
a daily paper to report fairly other politicians besides
M’Millan, Reid and co., who at present have a monopoly
of “ cheers,” “ loud applause,” and “ hear, hear.”

“Driver ** sends this surprising item :—-
There seems to be still a section of the community with
a vague idea that men in the service of the Victorian
Railway Commissioners work on the basis of an eight
hours day. The following programme of a day’s work for
an engine-driver (striker) may prove instructive :
On duty 6 a.m., North Melbourne engine sheds, clean,
oil, &c., engine. Time, f hour to 1 hour.
Take road to Flinders-street (owing to all other traffic
having precedence over an engine the time taken is
never under £ hour.)
Thus, after having worked for It hours, you couple on
to your train and draw it up to platform, and then your
pay starts. You are down to take a train to Oakleigh
and return ; time, 65 minutes. On return you are off
duty, and have to take your engine back to North Mel-
bourne, draw fires, clean, oil, etc.: another 11 hours.
So we have:
Time worked .. .. 4 hours 5 min.
Time paid for .. .. 1 hour 5 min.
With another broken shift in the afternoon, three more
hours lost time, and a trip to Oakleigh again at night, my
day consists of:
Time worked 17 hours
Time cleaning engines and taking same to
and from Flinders-st 9 hours
Time paid for 8 hours
On top of this we receive notification from Mr. Woodroffe
that all holidays earned by strikers prior to the strike are
forfeited.

More of N.S.W.’s Owe’Sullivan :
It is utterly impossible at present for the Government
to get money at a fair rate of interest. Every work along
the coast, and even the central railway station, and im-
provements in his own district, had suffered through
want of money. But he did not think this condition of
things would last long. Already there were indications
of a change for the better in London. The Government
would watch its opportunity and approach the money
market at the proper time, so as to be able to resume
operations on a number of works which were at present
suspended.
Same helpless old Owe’ with his off-hand assump-
tion that Australia can never pay its debts, can
never make even a drain except by incurring new
debts, and that when we are not incurring new
debts we must just sit down helplessly, and wait,
and abandon all progress, and begin sliding back
into the aboriginal stage. If N.S.W. could only
find a Ministry that had one progressive idea
apart from borrowing !

“B.” writes:—
A single morning of the Metropolitan Quarter Sessions
in Sydney afforded striking justification for the main
principle of B. R. Wise’s Habitual Criminals Bill. One
man convicted of breaking and entering had previously-
been sentenced to life imprisonment; another, found
guilty of stealing, had not been out of gaol for much more
than a month at a time during the last 25 years;
another was described as no sooner out of gaol
than in again ; another had started crime at 13 ‘
years of age, and till now had spent 18 years in gaol ;
another had spent 20 years in gaol; and the final one for
the morning was sent up for four years, the Judge
remarking, “You are no sooner discharged from gaol
than you are back again.” The problem of these re-
lapsing criminals insists on a solution. The Habitual
Criminals Bill can be made to sohe at least some of the
difficulty, and even a partial solution is better than the
present continuous drift.
♦-
The Act of 1890, which constituted the power of
the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works,
contains a clause which provides that if any
householder fails to comply with the order of the
Board to connect his premises with the sewers,
“ he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £2O,
and also, after conviction, to a further penalty
not exceeding £5 for every day during which such
offence continues.” Yet, in spite of the fact that
the State Government has received innumerable
notices to sewer the public buildings, the matter
is continually overlooked —a course which even the
meanest householder would pursue at his peril.
This is Kyabramming with a vengeance. Not
only are the State buildings unconnected, but even
the old system of sanitation is neglected, and the
germ thrives like a fraudulent importer with no
Kingston about. The explanation blandly put
forward is that there is no money available for the
purpose—a plea which is summarily disallowed
even to the poorest working men. They have,
times out of number, found themselves compelled
to sell their little cottages, purchased from a small
income after years of thrift and self-denial, because
they were unable to meet the heavy expense laid
upon them in the interests of health by a Parlia-
ment which itself sits in an unsewered building.
Now, if the Metropolitan Board could only intro-
duce a Bill to give Irvine 12 months, or fine him
£IOO, on the lines of his own Coercion Act, some-
thing might possibly be done.

Significant that, after several years of drifting,
the M.L. Oppositionists have elected a leader.
Russell was the last formal leader, but he is too
tired to fight nowadays—l 3 years in Opposition,
without even a remote hope of office, would make
any aged politician tired. It was on his nomina-
tion that Massey, of Franklin, who has been
more or less Opposition whip since 1895, was
appointed. Massey, who is an Onehunga farmer
when he isn’t a politician, isn’t so chilly as
Russell. He starts out, too, with some distant
hopes. Besides Seddon’s awkward fix with
regard to the great whisky question and his
troubles with the Farmers’ Union, the old warrior
has had to announce a severe cutting down of
works expenditure, and that is making more
people “full up of Seddon” than anything else
he could do. Maoriland is a fairly advanced
country; but a lot of it isn’t advanced enough
to forgive the man who refuses to build a railway
for it.
Britannia’s Needs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Britannia needs no bulwarks —no tars with voices
deep,
No hairy sons of sea-dogs to guard her island-
steep;
Her trust is in the Lascar —the Dagoes make her
crew,
She leans her weary trident on her alien A.B.
true.
Britannia needs no Britons stout —she fills her
slimy slum
With every kind of wastrel cur that wolfs a
British crumb ;
Her yeomen wander over-sea to grow Canadian
corn,
And leave the peer and Polish Jew the land
where they were born.
Britannia needs no wheat-fields. Her beef is
raised afar,
Her mutton mostly grew beneath a far-off southern
star;
Her lands are falling fallow—her hillsides keep
the deer—
She loves the antlers passing well and hates the
grazing steer.
Britannia needs a noddle that will show the need
of men !
The need of keeping foreign trash within the
foreign den ;
She needs to base her Greatness on other grounds
than Greed,
And brag the less and do the more to save a
failing breed.
Britannia needs no Empire—she needs to keep her
Isle
A Home for sturdy freemen in a slavish world
and vile ;
If such Britannia’s passion were—l ween that
never more
The Earth should find her battling with the
freedom-loving Boer.
Britannia needs a yeomanry of sturdy men and
hale
To take the place of city weeds who cough at
every gale;
She needs to place a firmer faith in manly bosoms
bold,
And put no more her single trust in ledger-lore
and gold.
Britannia needs to cleanse of cant her crusted
British soul,
To give her poor an honest due and no dishonest
dole,
To let the heathen bow content before his wood
and stone
Until Britannia’s island boast no heathen of its
own!

Town Hall. ..: Ada Crossley Concerts.
♦
The Crossley concerts began with good
houses and worked up to crammed audiences. As
Ada is accepted as one of the best contraltos of
the planet, the wonder is that the Town Hall was
not crammed, from the first, through curiosity
alone. A voice that is one of the best
amongst a population of 1,300,000,000 (so far
as the census-taker has been able to count
them without being eaten while enumerating the
cannibals) ought to be heard —especially as it
first breathed over an area near our Dandenong
Ranges. It is a voice that has been variously
described as “golden,” “mellow,” “honey
colored,” “ dark in color,” and “ without a break.”
The over-soulers who can see the color of a voice
are few as. yet, but they are gathering numbers,
and by-ana-bye the singer who lifts a pale
green voice with a touch of crimson at the
edge will be quite common. Most Sydneysiders
are holding some of their admiration for Miss
Crossley in leash until they can hear her in
oratorio. When she breaks out in the stately,
sublime music of oratorio, the public will know
for the first time exactly how good that splendid
voice can be. In English songs Miss Crossley is
specially appreciated. She lias sung the pathetic
“Little Silver Ring,” the arch, plantation air,
“ Mighty Like a Rose” and the sprightly “ Love,
the Pedlar,” with all the qualities which their
various composers intended them to possess.
Added to her other gifts, she is a generous singer.
She doe's not make a bow take the place-of an
aria. Also she is good to'look at, tall and straight,
with a golden crown of gleaming hair.

The Crossley support is not ricketty.
Jacques Jacobs, a pupil of Joachim, is a violinist
who is never out of a first-class billet, even if he
is not valuable enough to have his right hand
insured for a vast sum. Percy Grainger is a-
pianist and coir poser who may one day be great
in bis art. He has no mannerisms, and produces
great effects in a singularly quiet fashion.
His interpretation of Cyril Scott’s “English
Waltz” has already caused a run on the music
shops for that composer’s pieces. Peterkin, the
basso, is reckoned on all sides “an artist,” and
bis sea-roller voiee never fails to win an encore.
Benno Scherek pianos for the contralto and Peter-
kin. Last of the Crossley concerts will be to-day’s
matinee.
* * * *
“ As You Like It,” without which no
Bacon-drama season is genuine, is the third of
Musgrove’s Shakspearori productions at Sydney
Royal. It at least equals, and at some points
surpasses, even “ Midsummer Night’s Dream ” in
the impressiveness of its mounting. There are
long and tiresome waits ; but the sets which show
the Forest of Arden form an entire gallery of
stage pictures of such rare beauty that the waiting
is atoned for. Some of the imported people
appear at their best in this production. Miss
Kerin, for instance, the Rosalind of the show, has
done nothing else so good in Sydney ; nor has Miss
Rignold, though her Viola in “Twelfth Night”
was excellent in patches. Explosiveness is Miss
Kerin’s besetting sin; no wonder her throat
suffers at times. But especially in the first act,
and later, in the scene in "which, disguised in
doublet and hose, she sets herself to cure
her Orlando of love, she is as winning as
one could , wish a Rosalind to be. Miss Rignold,
an actress of a severer type, always restrained,
often indeed not so much alive as the situation
warrants, nevertheless always graceful, drops
some of those mannerisms of speech which, espe-
cially in “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” often
made it difficult to follow her lines. With Nor-
man Partridge presenting Orlando as no one who
judged him by his previous work would have
thought him capable of doing, the three principal
parts are well filled. Yet the production will be
remembered for the pictures rather than for any-
thing else.
* * * *
Next to these comes Athol Forde’s Adam.
A fine old fellow is Adam, none. better in the
whole play ; and when Orlando leads him off,
with “Cheerily, Adam, cheerily,” the audience
feels for perhaps the only moment in the 3| hours
a twinge of emotion. On the other hand, W. H.
Denny’s work, as Touchstone, is mostly thrown
away ; the professional fool’s fooling is wearisome
nowadays. Kenningham, also, has poor oppor-
tunities. He had the fool’s part in “Twelfth
Night,” and that suited his comic-opera manner
much better than his present part of Amiens, the
singing gentleman who attends a banished duke.
Miss Milton also has the thankless part of the
poor-witted “country wench ” Audrey ; Sydney
is fortunate in having had the chance to see
her in something else. Alfred Bucklaw is the
melancholy Jacques who carries the burden of
some of the monumental speeches that dis-
tinguish what otherwise does not take high
rank among the master’s plays. His is a
well-considered performance; gentlemen who
recite “ The Seven Ages of Man ’’ should turn up
to see and hear how Bucklaw does it —an acid,
morose philosopher wouldn’t do it as it is generally
done by young men in evening clothes, who have
only read the lines in Somebody’s Reciter. And
the other people who don’t, want to learn how to
recite “ The Seven Ages of Man ” ought to turn <
up, if only to see the Forest of Arden as Hawes 3
Craven and the other artists have pictured it. a
*# * *
“Toreador,” at Her Majesty's (Sydney),
struts in triumph, although there is, up to date,
no gore on the sawdust. For the matter of that,
there is no sawdust. Spain is a perfect mine for
the comic operator, as well as for the grand
operator. The Spanish brave wears rosettes on his
shoes, and carries his dagger, and makes love—all
with the same kind of ferocious grace. Of course the
odor of garlic would discount the passion of his love
if it were sung too close to Donna Teresa. Fortu-
nately he usually sings it from the footpath,
whilst she leans out of an upper window. There
is a “Carlist agitator” in this opera. He is
played by Fred Young, and he aliases under
the name of Rinaldo. His get-up would hang
him at sight—if the Spanish Government did
the sighting before he got his artillery into good
position. He carries infernal machines about in a
sack and says “Hist” in blood-freezing tones.
Another minor character is that of" a band-
master which, played by W. Stafford, causes
a major quantity of laughter. He interrupts
the Dan O’Connor periods of the Governor
of Villaya with his rub-a-dub, and plays the
fool with a new kind of idiocy. Miss Florence
Young’s voice has lost nothing in popularity by
the public (interview) announcement by Miss
Crossley that she is better than anyone in the
same line in London. The “Toreador” will kill
his invisible bull to music for many weeks yet. j
*** * ’
That flickery picture thing which is
variously called the biograph, bioscope, wonder-
graph, shadowgraph, shudderscope and things
like that, is to turn up again at Queen’s Hall,
Pitt-street, Sydney, on Saturday. It is described
this time as American and electrical, and is called
the Yitagraph, and is supposed not to flicker. If
it doesn’t flicker it will be viewed with satisfaction.
* * *
“Mistakes Will Happen” goes better at
Sydney Palace now that the co. has settled
down to its stride, and some of the situations
which were good before are now extra-good.
When the nagging ladies are advised to moderate
their language “because there are gentlemen
present,” and when the dour matron shoos her
husband off the premises “because he annoys the
dog,” the laughter is now frequent and free, for
the points of these jokes have got into the public
mind, which was hardly the case on the first night.
A playwright who makes anew or nearly new joke
inflicts on the co. which produces his wares a great
deal of responsibility ; the public laugh rises much
more readily to old and familiar gags. When the
joke is quite new a gun ought to be fired immedi-
ately before it is uttered to fix the public mind on
it, and a flag ought to be waved immediately after
the joke.
** # *
M'Adoo’s Jubilee Singers are to open
their dark countenances in song at Sydney Town
Hall on Saturday, and will continue the process
till further notice. The Singers have always sung
something worth hearing in the past, and they
will doubtless do so again. The fact that they
can come into this country freely ought to demon-
strate to a lot of people, who have been led away
by the foolish brayings of Carruthers and co., that
the Immigration Restriction Act isn’t the insane
document those persons have brayed it to be.

The clawing of Pagel by his pet lion was
an unexpected addition to the programme of
Wirth’s circus that recent eventful evening. The
dog, which usually bustles round as a peacemaker,
sat still that night in a corner with a wistful look
in his eye; he seemed to know things were serious,
and apparently reckoned it might be better for
himself if he didn’t interfere. Leo became un-
usually violent, and when Pagel was lifting him
managed to spring away and claw the Hercules.
Pagel immediately dashed him against the iron
bars, and would have fallen upon him and torn him
up, had not the shrill voice of Mrs. Pagel induced
him to leave the enclosure. The huge, brawny,
fair-haired Teuton is not the slightest bit afraid of
the lion, and the animal is still half scared of him.
The lion is now three years old, and just beginning
to feel his strength, and apparently there are lots
of exciting arguments between him and his master
in sto.re yet. “ Dick Turpin’s Ride to York ”is a
Wild mix-up of men, in various colored coats and
pale-green moonlight, who rush about the ring and
ride in and out of the tents at full gallop. The
two-bright features of the “Ride” are when
Turpin takes Black Bess over a five-bar gate at
full gallop, and when that splendid mare falls
down in a dying condition and is carried out by
the company on a stretcher to the strain of the
“ Dead March in Saul.” But this writer prefers
the Haute Ecole act; there’s a lot more in that.
To-night, Thursday, two tall Hindus will wrestle
for the championship of White Australia.
* # #
Captain Starlight, whom Rolf Boldrewood,
his creator, killed, but whom Alfred Dampier
decided ought to have a chance to live out a purer
and nobler life, is drawing larger crowds to
Sydney Criterion than had been hoped for.
There is at present no thought of offering any
other attraction, and the fact that in seven nights
14,000 people, or thereabouts, have cheered the
picturesque protector of women and robber of
mail-coaches seems to be a pretty strong hint that
any sudden change would be a mistake.
* * * . *
“ The Power and the Glory ” will be
followed at the end of the present week by
“ When London Sleeps” ; and when that highly-
spiced sensation has had its little run ‘ ‘ Her
Second Time on Earth,” which sounds something
unusual, will be shown for the first time here-
abouts.
j “ Valentine Day ” writes :
i “ 0.K.” mistakes the grounds of comparison which
should be between the cast of the original Rignoldian
production (IBS9-’9O) of “ Midsummer Night’s Dream ’
and that of the late Musgrovian production. The 1892
performance was a revival, and greatly inferior. In the
earlier cast, the Titania was Madge Seymour, pretty and
petite, who sang sweetly and danced beautifully,
and excelled in comedy moments. Writing from memory,
I imagine that Bessie Rignold (Dora’s sister) was
the Oberon, and she certainly made a fine figure and sang
the music excellently. Harry Jewett and Arthur Green-
away played the Athenian lovers; Kate Bishop and
Maribel Greenwood played Helena and Hermia. Bessie
Colville was the Puck, and by far and away the most limber
yet seen here. She was light of foot as a forest fawn,
and her exits were made with lightning rapidity—at the
end of a wire. The six rude mechanics were George
Rignold, Harry Leston, Stirling Whyte, Frank Ayrton,
Joe Tolano, and Frank Harcourt. I think that Charles
Hall played Egeus, and Hazlitt the Duke. Tilly Salenger
and Minna Phillips, to the best of my recollection, were
the singing fairies. In my opinion, taken player for
player, the Rignoldian cast, save in one or two instances,
was much the superior.

At Sydney Tivoli the only new turn this
week is that of the Powers Bros. They are
clever wire-rope acrobats; but the fashion for
circus-turns in music halls seems to be fading, and
they rouse no enthusiasm. Next Saturday Mar-
zella and her performing birds appear. This is
reported, on excellent authority, to have been a
boom and a blessing to Harry Rickards’ Mel-
bourne theatre; and doubtless it will prove the
same in Sydney.
** * *
“The Union Jack,” revived at Melb.
Royal on Saturday, has been one of Bland Holt’s
best business concerns for about 15 years. The
late George Gordon spread himself upon the
scenery of the first production; subsequently
Spong took a hand in the panorama; and now
the “picturesque illustrations” mighty fine
and large illustrations at that —are supplied
by John Brunton. Eleven scenes and a lot
of naval and military supers, are crowded
into a well-meaning melodrama. There are
no steam hammers or dynamite catastrophes
appertaining to this oft-told tale, nor does the
dialogue ever descend to the penny dreadful level,
but at times the conversation is rather dull and
prolonged. Love-scenes in melodrama are mostly
built to please the silliest part of the audience, and
the present case offers no exception to the rule.
Otherwise “Union Jack” commands respect.
Everything is strictly unoriginal, but the eternal
verities were considered by the authors when they
drew their long-bow together, and the one murder
in the piece befalls the principal villain at the
right time in a reasonable way. A neatly placed
deed of bloodshed has many charms.
* * * *
Two nice tall girls, blessed with £30,000
apiece by their defunct father, are pursued by
two bad men, and when one of these hard citizcms
has dug a hole in the other fellow’s chest all goes
well with the two good young men. They get the
£60,000 between them as a reward of merit. Also
a third girl is left at liberty to recover from her
base betrayal by the villain who has gone to
answer for his sins. Nobody seems to be looking
for work in this drama. The characters, without
exception, enjoy their three square meals a day ;
and Bland Holt, as an able-bodied seaman, gets
drunk whenever the spirit moves him. Mrs.
Bland on one occasion threatens to marry Brown,
the soldier-man, if her rolling mariner doesn’t
reform, but he vanquishes her scruples by climbing
up an apple-tree and pelting his rival with the
fruit thereof. Walter Baker scores the maximum
number of points as a hero; also, Miss Ross,
armed once again with her pocket-handkerchief,
is a sympathetic believer in Baker’s inn-o-cence.
JVliss Harrie Ireland supplies a happy perform-
ance of the other orphan sister, whose harmless
adorer is billed as “an army swell,” although he
doesn’t look it. Miss Pollock makes a jaunty
pretence of being Bland Holt’s mother on wash-
ing day; whilst Miss Rutledge walks feebly
through the part of the lost innocent who listened
to Albert Norman by the light of the moon.
Styan is artistic as a moderately evil baronet, and
Brightie Smith, sad to say, makes no appearance
whatever.
** * *
Ada Crossley, who had a pretty big Mel-
bourne reputation before she became a distin-
guished singer on a distant shore, is making her
first appearance at Melbourne Town Hall on
Saturday next, Oct. 3. Percy Grainger, the
golden-haired kiddie pianist of yore, returns to
the’scene of his juvenile achievements on the same
evening, a full-grown genius with a “Mr.” to his
name. The Ada Crossley concerts are fixed for
Oct. 3,6, 8, Id, and 12, and when those five dates
have been named further remarks would be super-
fluous. Everybody who knows what’s what in
musical entertainment will attend one or other of
the concerts. The wisest people will attend them
all.

“Resurrection” is to run for another
week at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), the demand
for that depressing Russian fable being fairly
brisk. Whether the great masses of feminine
public are most attracted by the charms of Julius
Knight or the horrors of the prison scene is a
debatable question. Julius Knight, formerly of
Ancient Rome, is an established favorite, and his
fur trimmiugs are much admired, but the prison
scene likewise has fascinations for the more
curious sek. Prisons are such free-and-easy
places—in Russia. All the convict ladies
picnic together under the supervision of
male warders who whack them with the knout
(off the stage) when they feel so disposed. Also
gentlemen visitors are permitted to drop in and
supply the drunkest lydy with unlimited liquor
money, what time her companions are at
prayers. There never'was so much gin and shriek
in any previous prison scene, therefore the present
opportunities for a moral lesson ought not to be
missed. They will terminate on October 9th, and
“Monsieur Beaucaire” is to take the stage on
Saturday, the 10th.
* * *
“Are You a Mason ? ” concludes its little
joke at Melbourne Princess’s this Friday, making
way for “Oh! What a Night!” The comedy
with the exclamatory title can’t flourish for more
than two or three weeks, apparently, owing to the
theatre having been engaged by the Caledonian
Society, and an amateur Mikado co. and other
intrepid organisations.
** # *
At the Opera House the champion cockatoo
will have turned his last somersault ere these
remarks come to light. In place of Madame
Marzella and her birds W. 0. Fields, the frivolous
juggler, will pop up again on Friday, also Miss
Frances Leslie, a soprano from America, makes
her appearance. There is nothing else of an
exciting nature to say about the Rickards show,
except that the first part was changed last Satur-
day.

The Williamson co. made a brilliant finish
at Adelaide Royal with one night of “ The Chris-
tian,” Hall Caine’s own version of his gloomy story
being used. Before that the co. had given a short
trial to “If I were King,” which showed Athol-
wood at his best; Cuyler Hastings and Miss Lane
doing good work in parts not too well suited to
them. Also the grey charger seemed to be some-
what out of condition; but Edmund Gwenn
showed howagood man can make a small part stand
out. The mounting was excellent. The Adelaide
Royal stage is only moderate in size, and when
the houses of mediaeval Paris, and the Court party,
and the rabble all got on it at once there was_ not
much room to move about. In “Secret Service”
Hastings’American accent got a chance to hold
up its head at last; also Atholwood played a
nigger and Mabel Lane an old lady. William
Anderson is now back from Broken Hill with a
human ladder that descends from roofs and" robs
steam-hammers of their accustomed food, the
virtuous maiden. Mark Hambourg is giving
recitals at the Town Hall, but the Tivoli is closed
for the present.
The Wild Cat Column.
J.S.P. : The present co. is only about 14
months old and has paid three divs. of 2s. Quarterly
divs. of 2s. 6d. are promised, which would mean about
per cent, at 655. Bewick-Moreing (Kalgoorlie) are the
Australian representatives. Shouldn’t care to advise
buying E.J.S. : Consult R. N. Kirk, Sydney agent
of Broken Hill co’s, Imperial Chambers M.S. : Don’t
know the agent who has been engaging miners
to go to West Coast of Africa. It’s a good coast
to keep away from... .William Bendigo : Should say that
“about” signified that it was simply an estimate, and
that would not bind the society. You have paid less
than vou would in, say, the A.M.P., which is a set off
against non participation in profits during tontine period.
The tontine idea pans out best for those who continue
beyond the 20-year period.

society’s way, notwithstanding that it gets £212,022 at 21
per cent. What the loans are worth, and what, therefore,
the alleged intact capital is worth, are consequently
things that make one sad to think about. Nevertheless,
some progress is being made, especially in the matter of
reducing the liabilities to depositor's, mortgagees, and
banks ; the total has moved in the last few years in this
way
1897 .. £383,689 1901 .. £301,177
1898 .. 338,966 1902 .. 288,630
1899 .. 322,551 1903 .. 271,700
1900 .. 813,838
In six years, therefore, these liabilities have been reduced
by £111,989, and in the same period the assets have been
reduced by £173,711 (paper value). If the liquidation
can proceed at the same rate, the balance of these
liabilities can be got rid of by sacrificing about £425,000
(paper value) of the assets ; and that would leave the
society with about £77,000 of its capital. Even that is
something a long way better than a few years ago seemed
at all possible.

Victorian Chief Justice Madden is at work on a
brain-racking insurance case. Twenty-five years ago the
Australian Alliance Assurance Cos. paid a large amount for
shares in the Australasian Insurance Cos. The Alliance’s
fire branch for some years satisfied the liabilities arising
from the purchase of these shares, until the fire branch
became overdrawn ; and then, in 1884, a cheque for
£31,834 was drawn on the life branch and paid to the fire
branch. The Alliance’s life policy-holders (through
Joseph Webster) now want that £31,834 back, with
interest since 1884. Also, they allege that profits haven’t
come their way in the shape of bonuses as they should
have done —briefly, that the shareholders in the Alliance
have had in dividends a good deal of what ought to have
gone to the policy-holders in bonuses. The main dispute
is complicated by a subsidiary dispute as to what has been a
fair share of expenses for the life branch to carry: practi-
cally, the Alliance has left off taking new business (it has
only issued 46 new policies in the last two years, and that is
a good deal above the average), while its fire business has
increased ; yet the proportion of expenses hasn’t, it is
claimed, been readjusted. The defence is that everything
has been done for the best, and the Trusts Act and the
Act of Limitation and other solid masses of law are relied
upon ; also that the mere policy-holder isn’t entitled to
pry into the question of distributing the profits of a pro-
prietary concern—if anybody except the shareholder is to
do it, it is, not the policy-holder, but the man who is to
draw the money when the policy-holder dies. The Alliance
is not the only Australian assurance co. which has
practically gone out of the life business ; and though
most of these manage to pay very large dividends t)
shareholders, no bonuses seem to be reaching the
policy-holders. Possibly the latter have no legal claim ;
it all'depends upon the articles of association or deed of
settlement—in the case of the Alliance it is claimed that
the shareholders have a right to only 25 per cent, of the
profits, the policy-holders owning the rest. If, then, the
present case doesn’t settle policy-holders’ rights to
bonuses generally, it ought to set' them inquiring what

have ascertained that the Mond Gas Co. of Staffordshire
have accepted the tender of Mephan Ferguson, of Mel-
bourne, for the supply of about 13 miles of Ferguson’s
Patent Lockingbar Steel Pipes, from 18 inches to 36 inches
diameter. The machinery for manufacturing these pipes
has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire,
where the branch works are being erected. The same
firm have also erected engineering and pipe works at
Wanganui, New Zealand, and have contracted to supply
the Wai gmui Borough Council with about 20 miles of
Spiral hiveted Steel Pipes for the town water supply.*

their legal rights are in the special insurance concern
(especially any proprietary concern) in which they are
interested : whether, in short, they are to have a share
of the profits right to the end, or whether bonuses will
be paid only as long as the concern is seeking business,
and as a bait to catch new insurers. This, of course,
doesn't affect the case now before the Court (if it did,
this could not yet be written), because in that case the
position is said to be clearly defined by deed, and the
complication is simply the result of mixing up the two
main branches of insurance business.

The shareholders’ paid capital is £4721, but £3500 of this
went to pay for the goodwill of a previous institution ;
part of this amount has been written off, and the item
now stands in the co.'s balance-sheet at £2OOO. Very
little information is given as to the company’s business ;
not even the total amount of assurance in force is stated.
A valuation is, however, promised as at the close of the
current year, and thereafter triennially. Even then, on
account of the extremely complex nature of most of the
policies, the position will not be clear unless the funds of
the industrial and the ordinary branches are separated.
In the industrial branch all sorts of frilled policies are
available ; and it isn’t advisable that the insurance fund
to meet the plain, ordinary policies should be mixed up
with the insurance fund for the frilled sort of policy.
Business, however, in either sort seems to be dull; prac-
tically no progress whatever has been made during the
past two or three years—except in the matter of expenses.
Premiums (which include payments under the bottle-
of-medicine, Sarah Gamp, and other frilled policies before-
mentioned) amounted to £12,021 in 1901; in 1903 they
amounted to £12,313. Meantime, however, expenses
have risen from £5933 to £6471, and the dividend (£235)
makes tho total of £6706 shown above.
This shows the awful waste of the industrial
assurance system—the system under which, instead of
saving up a quarter’s or half-year’s premium, the working
man encourages the canvasser to call round every
Monday for twopence or thereabouts. The People’s
Prudential has practically added nothing to its business
in the last two or three years; and a society doing
ordinary business would, in those circumstances, show
an expense-rate of £lO per cent, of its income. But an in-
dustrial co. has to spend so much time and shoe-leather
hunting up the twopences, and it has to spend so much
more time and leather hunting up people who will take
the place of other- people who won’t pay the twopences
any longer, that, in spite of the net progress being prac-
tically nil, the expense-rate is enormous, and is still
growing. Year by year since the company started the
rate has been as follows :
Expenses in Proportion to Income.
1897.. £44 1 8 percent. 1901.. £4B 8 3 per cent.
1898.. 39 16 3 „ 1902.. 52 0 5 „
1899.. 39 13 5 „ 1903.. 52 17 5 „
1900.. 41 0 8 „ V
In the last two years a dividend of 5 per cent, on capital
is included ; deducting that, the rate was £SO ss. lOd. for
1902 and £sl os. 4d. for 1903. In view of the fact that
the premium income is practically stationary, these
figures could hardly be less satisfactory. The outlook for
customers has seemed hitherto to be unpromising ; and
it looks more unpromising now than ever.

Another example of how the Protected manufacturer
becomes a bloated monopolist and robs the country. In
these six years the shareholders have received £1167,
and have lost £2loo—they have lost their dividend
and £933 besides, in addition to getting no return on
£48,679 of capital. The co. has had to struggle
under a heavy load of overdraft and interest, against
which it has made little headway ; the progress in the
past six years has been as follows :
Overdrafts Interest and
Overdraws. Discounts.

Moreover, it cannot, unfortunately, be said that business
is improving; on the contrary, sales show, during the
last three years, a steady and serious downward move-
ment. The accounts, by the way, are commendably full
and clear.

It has been a bad year ; revenue from business was over

The Federal exists largely for the convenience Of visitors
who come down to see the waxworks and other wonders,
and for the last two years the country hasn’t had enough
toeome down with. What little profit the co. has made
has gone towards reducing the fearful load of mortgage
debt which is still carried ; it is down now to £55,625, £750
having been paid off during the year. On the other
hand, the net overdraft has gone up from £1976 to £2142,
making the total debt £57,767. Two years ago, on a
small burst of prosperity, this co. paid a dividend of 21$
per cent. 1 The late figures make that act look more
foolish than ever.

Premier See told a questioner in N.S. W. Assembly
a few nights back that the State’s steam yacht Victoria
costs the country £B7B a year in insurance premiums.
The almost useless craft is supposed to be worth some-
thing over £25,000, so it ought to be covered by some
insurance. There seems to be no particular reason, how-
ever, why the Government should not create its own
insurance fund —no particular reason, anyhow, apart
from the fact that if it did start a fund the Government
would probably lay hold of it, and use it instead of
revenue the first time nobody was looking. Not that
an insurance fund is any more necessary than ah
ordinary sinking fund. In fact, from one point of
view a sinking fund is more necessary, because, while it
is at least possible that the Victoria will not founder or
be otherwise destroyed by accident, it is absolutely cer-
tain that both it and every other thing that is made of
wood, or stone, or iron, or putty will fall to pieces some
day, from old age and ordinary wear and tear ; so the
country that can’t see the need of a sinking fund to wipe
out the cost of the perishable concern which was paid for
with borrowed money can’t reasonably be expected to
see the need of an insurance fund

ment of the half-year (capital, £66,000; calls in advance,

long drop. As, however, nothing has been written off for
wear and tear, the net profit is a good deal less than this.

placement, £7500.
The unspeakable Bent system of management is
■ working havoc with the Victorian railway revenue. Bent
knocked off trains wholesale, and. traffic took to other
channels. He saved money on repairs till the dilapidated
rolling stock couldn’t carry even what traffic was left,
and thousands of tons of goods that would bring in hand-
some freights lie waiting the trucks that never come.
For the first 2$ months of the present financial year the
revenue is £51,550 less than it was during the same
period in 1902 ; and, if the slump continues, the year’s
loss will be fully £250,000.

In emotion and italics the directors draw attention to the
fact that, for the first time, the co. has had to pay income
tax—£sos, “ equal,” they point out, “to J per cent, on
the capital of the co.” To this and to the issue of anew
schedule of rates which may temporarily affect the earn-
ings the reduced dividend is ascribed. Perhaps £505
is a good deal of income-tax to pay ; but a co. which, in
spite of shockingly bad times, and after paying the tax,
can still make lH P er cent, on its capital, can better
afford to pay and look pleasant than most concerns.

The quinquennial report of the Queensland
Registrar of Friendly Societies shows that, in the northern
State as elsewhere, some of these poor men’s insurance
institutions still earn a miserable rate of interest on their
funds, the average for the whole of the societies being
£2 18s. per cent. Only one society, the Manchester Order
of Oddfellows in North Queensland, earns over 4 per
cent.; the Brisbane Foresters, numerically one of the
strongest, earns 1£ per cent. It is not at all surprising,
therefore, in view of this obviously bad business
management, that, according to actuarial calculations,
the societies will be unable to pay anything like the
amounts which, they have undertaken to pay. The
Foresters show up, on the whole, worst in this respect;
of the three “ districts ” one could only pay 14s. 6d. in
the £, even if its funds were earning 3 per cent., which
they aren’t; another could pay 15s. Id. (in this case the
funds are actually earning less than 1£ per cent.), and
another could pay 16s. There is only one society, and
that a small German concern, which has a surplus and is
likely to be able to pay all its members 20s. in the £ of
what it has undertaken to pay. In all other cases the
contributions must either be increased dr the benefits
reduced.
Maoriland friendly societies show a much better
result ;• yet in his last report the Government actuary
says there are still some managers who, “ through ignor-
ance, carelessness, or indifference, have never realised
the fact that the regular and judicious investment of the
funds at the highest, rate of interest obtainable, con-
sistent with perfect security, is a primary condition of
success in every friendly society.” The aggregate sick
and funeral funds, notwithstanding this, averaged a
return of £4 9s. 7d. per cent.; one district of Manchester
Oddfellows realised £6 3s. per cent. One of the officers of
the State Life Assurance Department has been set aside
during several years past to help put these societies on
a firm financial basis ; and he seems to be doing it.

The S.A. Gas Cos. differs from the Melbourne and Metro-
politan (Sydney) Gas cos. inasmuch as it covers practically
the whole field of gas-making in its State it supplies, as
well as the city and suburbs, Port Adelaide, Glenelg,
Port Pirie, Gawler, Kapunda, and Strathalbyn—every
fair-sized centre, that is, in S. Australia. All but £7700
of the reserves are used in the business ; the amount
mentioned is in S.A. State stock. The capital is
£250,000; and on this and the reserves, as at the com-
mencement of the year, the return was equal to £8 16s.
Bd. per cent. The co. is one of the very few S. Australian
concerns which don’t show for the past year a better
return than usual, and nothing in particular seems to
have been responsible for it—there has been a general
small decline in receipts and a general small increase in
expenses.

Before the Westralian Government’s water
supply approached Kalgoorlie, that beautiful thing,
Private Enterprise, supplied the people with drinking
water at an average rate of about £3 15s. per 1000 gallons.
It would doubtless still be charging that if there were no
Government supply. The Government supply costs
about 6s. 6d. per 1000 gallons, and doesn’t pay at that,
and it is proposed to levy a rate and make other arrange-
ments, which will make the price something under £l.
Bub the people, who thought it quite natural that Private
Enterprise should charge £3 155., denounce the idea of
the State charging less than one-third of that as shame-
ful tyranny. Lands Minister Hopkins suggested, that, as
the hotelkeepers were making most of the row, they
might reduce the price of drinks from Is. to 6d. ; with
smaller profits, their municipal valuation wouldn’t be so
high, and then their water-rate, being based on the
valuation, would fall correspondingly. The publicans’
opinion of Hopkins is unpublishable.

Metal prices are again making miners feel un-
easy. Copper has eased a further 30s. within 10 days,
and lead has had another drop. Silver alone has had a
spring ; but speculation seems to be at the bottom of
that, so it probably won’t last long. Almost the whole
of the recovery which took place all round early in the
year has now been lost, and prices are back to very near
the level pf this time last year. The following figures
show the recent movement:
' Sept., 1900. Sept. 1902. March, 1903. Sept., 1903.
Copper £73 0 0 £52'12 6 £64 0 6 £55 10 0
Tin 132 10 0 118 10 0 136 11 6 119 5 0
Lead 17 15 0 10 17 6 13 4 6 11 1 3
Spelter 19 5 0 19 0 0 ,22 18 0 21 0 0
Silver 2 51-16 1 11J 1 10. V 2 3 7-16
September, 1900, was about the height of the last metal
boom ; from that point there was a rapid fall till the end
of 1901, followed by a recovery which reached its best in
March, 1903. Lead has had the worst relapse. It was on
the price passing £l2los. that some of the smaller Broken
Hill mines resumed work ; and the present fall must
make their position very critical, notwithstanding the
improvement in silver. Lead-market reports have, never-
theless, been a trifle more cheerful than they were a while
back; one significant feature is that, while the imports
to Great Britain from the U.S. in the first half of 1902
amounted to 28,968 tons, they fell to 18,532 tons in
the first half of this year. This probably means that
the stocks accumulated in the U.S. during 1899-1900
are about used up. Copper stocks are also stated
to be again low. The effect of last year’s low prices is
shown by the accounts of the Calumet and Hecla,
America’s big producer. To April 30th, 1903, it turned
out in 12 months 42,216 tons refined copper, as against
42,462 tons the previous year ; but dividends were only
2,000,000, as against 4,000*000 dollars. As to spelter, on
which Brcken Hill builds much hope for the future, the
report of the Belgian Soci6t6 de la Vieille Montagne,
the largest spelter manufacturer in the world, is par-
ticularly interesting. After putting aside in 1902 a reserve
of 515,066 fr. (about £32,600) as required by law (Aus-
tralian-law hasn’t yet reached that degree of common-
sense), it made a divisible profit of 3,726,924 fr. (£149,000).
“ The production of zinc in Europe,” it says, “ showed
an increase of about 12,000 tons over 1901, but the con-
sumption appeared to be larger, and the price of the
metal was much better. The, improved situation was
due to the increasing demand for zinc for various pur-
poses. . . . The production (of ore) does not seem to have
increased in accordance with the demand.”

The washing-up process of the unfortunate
Great Central Freehold copper mines at Mount Hope
(N.S.W.) came before the Melbourne law courts last week,
and was very lightly reported in the dailies. The co.
sued certain parties (of Chillagoe fame) for non-fulfilment
of contract to purchase shares. The defendants did not
limit their pleadings to legal grounds alone, but alleged
misrepresentations. This was a bold move, more especially
as the principal defendant was a director of the plaintiff
company at the time the contract, and alleged misrepre-
sentations, were made. The decision of the court, how-
ever, after a week’s trial, was a vindication of the Gt.C.F.
directors personally. A verdict for the full amount-
claimed, viz., £3333 16s. Bd., was given against Messrs.
Chapman, Higgins and F. P. Brett, the defendants.

“0. ” : Two Palmer (N.Q.) sluicing companies,
the Bonanza and the Mammoth, have just been floated in

prised if the Palmer supplied that something.

HYMEN (to legal lady, spinster, Ac.): “Drop it!
What this country wants is more wives and
Toothers and fewer lawyers!”
A Perth (W.A.) Sunday paper, edited by
Tommy Walker, ex-M.L.A. of N.S.W., lately
published an alleged libel on Perth’s champion
litigant, who took on the legal feud with the light
of battle shining in his eye. The affair, of course,
started with a writ claiming damages for libel.
The paper’s lawyers then issued a summons for
security for costs, which was dismissed owing to
an informality. Paper’s statement of defence
becoming overdue, the plaintiff signed an inter-
locutory judgment, and applied to the court for
assessment of damages. Paper then applied for,
and secured, the setting aside of the judgment
with costs, and sent its bailiff to collect the costs.
Bailiff found nothing to seize but an assortment
of papers of no value to anyone but the plain-
tiff, who secured the permission of the Sheriff to
constitute himself bailee of them, and to use
them in the legal campaign meanwhile. Next
round commenced by the paper taking out another
summons for security for costs. Granted this time
by the Chief Justice. Plaintiff then appealed to
the Full Court against the order, and, after a
desperate encounter against eminent legal horse-
hair, induced the Court to set aside the order
(Chief Justice not dissenting). The paper’s law-
yer asked that the costs of the setting aside of the
interlocutory judgment might be set off against
the plaintiff’s costs, but the Court held that, hav-
ing elected to issue execution, and having seized
the valuable lot of unmarketable papers aforesaid,
the paper must be content therewith. Paper or-
dered to deliver defence within seven days. Next
round opened with the paper commenting on the
decision, and suggesting, that one of the Judges
was biassed. The plaintiff promptly moved for a
rule nisi for contempt. Refused, as his case was
not prejudiced; but next day the Attorney-
General moved for, and obtained, a rule. Tommy
Walker, on the return day, attended in person,
unaccompanied by legal shark, and explained that
he meant merely unconscious bias. He was let off
on payment of the costs of application. Many
more rounds are now in prospect.

The up-to-date daily paper runs its serial
story on mutoscope lines; just as something
wicked is about to happen the curtain goes down.
Sydney D.T.’s shocker on a recent Thursday con-
cluded—
“ Your skin is white, is it not? You are proud of its
smoothness, its fairness, the pink flesh glowing beneath
the outer white. Well, since you are so proud of it,
’twould be a pity to keep so much of it hidden. And so,
your Highness,” she made a mock courtesy, “ Princess
Inez of Veragua, we propose that you shall be stripped,
so that all may admire, not only those here, but the men
of my establishment, the grooms, the lackeys, aye, even
the old Indians. 'Tis not often they have the oppor-
tunity to see pink and white.”

Of course, everybody who read that item bought
Friday’s issue to see all about the lady being
undressed, and found her jogging along through
the story with all her clothes on.

Are you a Mason 1 George Coppin is
appealing to the aproned citizens of Victoria for
the sum of £l2OO to endow another two “ homes ”
at the Melbourne Masonic Asylum, which, as he
explains, is practically a Freemasons’Old Colonists’
Association, the minimum age for an inmate being
50 years. The veteran’s circular is self-con-
gratulatory and interesting. He talks about his
own long connection with the craft and what he
has done for it. In March 1845 he was initiated
into the secret of the mystic gridiron; in 1871 a
committee of Brethren recognised his services
with a testimonial; subsequently he was elected
boss cockie of the Victoria Grand Lodge; and now
he states that when he is “ summoned to appear
before the Great Grand Master (they have made
the Almighty a Mason) to give an account of his
work, it will give him great happiness to feel that
the buildings for Masonic Old Colonists are
thoroughly protected by endowment against the
precarious and uncertain whims of casual sub-
scribers.” Good old Cop! A Bulletin paragraph
lately set him down as an evergreen of 90 winters,
but he’s not yet so ancient as that. He was born
April Bth, 1819.

During the recent gales in Melbourne the
lightship off Gellibrand, which marks a dangerous
reef, broke from its moorings and drifted three miles
out towards St. Kilda, where it was eventually
captured. Apparently it hasn’t had any new
moorings for a long while, for fear of damaging
Irvine’s “surplus.” There has been a constant
agitation for a decent structure in the vicinity,
the materials for which lie close at hand, but
Bent’s Public Works Department won’t do any-
thing till a P. and O. steamer goes ashore some
night while the lightship is having “time-off.”
Bent invented the idea of time-off without salary,
by the way.
* * * *
Two recent Yarra drowning cases are
monuments to the parsimony of the Victorian
Government—and particularly of the Bent Public
Works Department. Like everything else under-
taken in Melbourne at the public expense, the
Yarra improvement scheme lies half finished, as
it will lie until Cohen springs another loan. But
there is no excuse for the authorities leaving two
large excavations, some 30ft. deep, with perpen-
dicular sides, and containing 13ft. of water, unpro-
tected. The place is a veritable death-trap for
those who don t know the Government’s habit of
digging holes and then leaving them till next loan.
A watchman was employed at night time for three
years, but was lately withdrawn, as Irvine wanted
his wages to help the “surplus.” There is no
fence—it has also gone into the surplus'; and
there have been two drownings in one week. Also
the mother of ,a drowned boy died of shock—
which makes three corpses in Irvine’s “surplus.”
Apparently nothing will be done till Bent himself
falls in.

About the most tragic event connected
with the fall of the late Queensland Ministry was
the enforced abandonment of a gorgeous palace
car just completed for vice-regal and Ministerial
jaunts. Said car contained drawing room, bath-
room, lavatories, most elaborate fittings, lovely
panels—some “in the nude ” —painted at a cost of
£5O by a local artist, vice-regal coat-of-arms, &c.,
&c. Total cost about £3OO0 —a large sum to be
made good out of unfortunate swagmen’s poll-
taxes. And the Philp Government was kicked
out of office just as the car was completed.

A. Melbourne laborer has put up about the
best thing on record in the way of .explanations.
He told his washup that the bruises on his wife’s
face arose solely “ through his kissing her when
he came home from Maoriland.” As the lady was
reported to be bruised all over, however, the
court looked on the explanation suspiciously, and
made it £lO or three months.
The scoff of
“Revert”:—
“ Olmo'” (B.
27/8/’OS) is quite
right. There
seems to be a
general mis-
apprehension
about bar-
maids. They
are employed
by publicans
in order to de-
crease the
drink traffic—
not so much
w ay - b a c k,
where the dry,
hard soakers
would soak if
Satan lashed it
at them from
a cauldron, as
in towns and
cities, where
the youthful
population is
more in need
of kind, pure,
motherly ad-
vice. How
often may one
see one of these
good women
reasoning with
a wayward
youth, some-
times hand in
hand, or with
an arm around
his shoulder,
and with tears
in her eyes beg-
ging him not
to have another
“small shandy.”
Many a time have I seen a sweet, gentle
girl with golden hair and the face of an
angel, pleading thus with a half-drunk
navvy and urging him to shun the cursed bowl,
the publican, meanwhile, standing just within earshot
with a mild ecstasy of approval in his eye. Struggling
hard for the right and the benefit of their species these
noble spirits (publicans) are shamefully misrepresented.
No honest observer can deny that the influence of bar-
maids tends to put down drink.

Habitues of Melbourne City Court had
the pleasure, the other day, of gazing on a very
brave man who took on what will probably turn
out a very large contract. A young woman, after
being fined £5 for her severalth offence of using
“ langwidge,” was charged with having insufficient
means, &e. Whereupon a hero stepped forward
and announced that, as he was very fond of the
lady, he proposed preparing a home in the suburbs
for her, and in that home he proposed to teach
and reform her. When she was completely re-
formed he intended to marry her and live an
idyllic life for ever after. The worldly-wise beak
smiled grimly, but allowed the defendant to go
away to be “reformed.” The man who took on
this huge contract was aged 23, and earned 30s. a
week, and it was shown that the lady, to block
the arresting constable, had undressed in the main
street. Thirty shillings a week won’t go far
towards “ reforming ” a lady of that reckless habit.
But the young man has a lot of excitement before
him.
ECONOMY.
“One of the latest economies on the Victorian railways
is that the passengers are to turn the gas up or
down (or out), as required, and prevent waste.”— Daily
Paper.
DUBIOUS LOOKING PARTY (just as the train gets
into motion): “Of corse, yer won't mind me
turnin' out ther gas, miss; ther bloomin'
Goverment can't hafford no hextra expenses.”
THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS.
MRS. DE VERE JONES (who has advertised for a
parlor-maid): “ You have had the journey
out for nothing, I am sorry to say, as I am
already suited; however, as it is a long way
I'll pay your fare. Did you come by tram
or ’bus?”
APPLICANT (pertly): “Thank you, I just ran out
on me bike.”
A sweet spring-time advfc. in the “Missing
Friends” column of Melbourne Age the other
week was calculated to make more than one girl
happy. “ You are my love; every tree and shrub
as it blossoms tells how your boy loves you.”
Simply that and nothing more. No hint as to the
identity of the ad vertiser or of the girl. Although
he called himself a “boy,” he was possibly the
proverbial romantic man of forty suffering from
springicitis amoritis. Also, he was not impro-
bably a lunatic of no age in particular. There
are two or three polite lunatics knocking around
Melbourne just now, one of them being an alleged
Saviour, who wants to advertise his advent in the
dailies at 6s. per inch.

“ G.H. ” ; “A man never knows what a
woman can do until she cries” (Bulletin, Aug. 20).
Doesn’t he? I remember a case where he
knew right enough. Smith (the man) had
lost his wife per elopement with a strange
gentleinan*who occupied a front pew in a
suburban church ; and Smith stood with
a stony jaw on the steps of the Divorce
Court, waiting till his case should be
shrieked for. The lost wife, a super-
abundant female published in a bright
scarlet binding, stood there too, and
publicly besought Smith to forgive her
and takeherhome. (N.B.— The strange
religious gentleman, having tired of
her, had abandoned her at Manly with
seven pence in coppers.) The more the
lady besought and flung her arms
round Smith’s neck the rockier Smith’s
countenance became. Finally, she
tried the last she-resource—tears, gal-
lons of them. Smith wiped her and
the moisture from his shirt-front, and
laughed—a hard, bitter laugh that
sounded like bad sandwiches. ‘‘Cry
and be hanged !” he said. “Twice I
was soft enough to let you howl your
way back. Once you wept in a blue
dress and a big hat with a red feather
in it, and next time you wept in a green
frock and a big hat with a white feather
in it. Now you can weep in these red
clothes till the court’s bogged if you like, but
I’m full up.”

“P.L.”: As illustrating the distress pre-
valent in Queensland, it might be mentioned that
in one month, this year, 585 families received
public relief in Brisbane alone. Rockhampton
boasts empty houses by the hundred, and Bunda-
berg is half deserted. As to the western towns,
their condition simply beggars And
Queensland has no “ socialistic legislation.”
THE SYMPATHISER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
During a recent Victorian newspaper controversy on
Old Age Pensions, a contributor, himself a highly-salaried
State official entitled to a pension, stated that he “ yielded
to none in tenderness and sympathy for the aged poor,”
but he violently objected to Old Age Pensions, all the
same.
“My heart is sore,” he said,
“ For all the agbd crones—
Who really should be dead ;
I grieve to hear their moans.
*' I yield to none in my
Anxiety to give
The poor who soon must die
A blessing while they live.
“ Pve prayers and tracts for those
Who totter down the street—
For prayers are more than clothes,
And tracts are more than meat.
“Some folks would money give—
But ah t the sinful waste ;
Like water through a sieve
It vanishes in haste.
“ For poor and agfed, then,
I sigh as all men should :
’Tis verra cheap, ye ken—
’Tis verra cheap and good.
'* On this I’ve built my plan
On this immortal fact:
However wasteful man,
He will not drink a tract.”

A Western telegram to the Sydney
papers:—
A solicitor was to-day suspended for six months
for having failed to properly account for money
held by him for a client. It was found that the
client was in a starving condition, and sick in the hos-
pital, and though he implored the solicitor for the money
he could not get it.
A solicitor gets six months’ holiday for not
accounting for the money of a sick person in a
hospital. And the clerk who doesn’t account for
the money of a healthy solicitor (healthy except
for over-feeding) in a club would easily get six
years’ gaol.

Troubles.
“Insulting behavior” is such a large,
comprehensive term that it has even served as an
excuse for running in a woman of doubtful sanity
who entered Melbourne riding on the buffer of a
railway carriage. She had travelled 31 miles that
way. Presumably her conduct was held to be
derogatory to the locomotive, for it isn’t recorded
that she was otherwise than perfectly respectful
to everybody she met.

Sydney magistrate Donaldson, who sent a
boy of good character to gaol for one month for
tossing pennies in the street, is the gentleman
who recently broke out on the barmaid question,
contending that a barmaid had less claim than
other women to protection from insult because
“sheknew what she was doing when she accepted
that occupation”—just as a policeman should have
no remedy for assault because he knew when he
took up his line of business that he must needs
arouse the animosity of bad characters.

Some old Sydney buildings are on the
market—those known as Wilshire Place, Brick-

were two leases to the north of him and but one
to the south. East and west was bush, and
George-street was a cart track. Mr. Wilshire was
a tanner, his tannery being at the rear of the
buildings now about to be sold. He was the
second Mayor of Sydney, became a member of
the Legislative Council, and had a splendid monu-
ment over his remains in tho old Sandhills ceme-
tery. Not many Australian families retain a
century’s hold on their estates.

“ Ilex ” ; I have had the misfortune to
attend a Melbourne funeral. As the
dismal procession started, I
noticed an ex-
tremely seedy in-
dividual start
simultaneously in
the same direc-
tion. It was a
wet day, and the
St. Kilda ceme-
tery was three
miles distant,
yet whenever I
looked out of the
dog-box there
was the w e t,.
shabby individual
keeping well
abreast of us.
The • puzzle was
solved when he
was observed at
the cemetery dis-
puting with a
dozen others their
claims to the
privilege of
“holding a
horse.” Whether
he obtained the
job, and, if so,
whether any re-
muneration was
forthcoming, I
know not; but on
the return journey
I saw him pass
the first pub. with
a dejected air, so
I concluded that
the local “com-
bine ” had been too
strong for the
foreign competitor.

“Kati Kati” on
a large subject:
Some people seem
much concerned about
widows remarrying. Why
shouldn’t they? Because it
prevents the marriage of some
spinster? Not a bit of it. The
more marrying there is the more
there will be. Besides, the man who
marries a widow doesn’t want a wife to
love and cherish ; he wants one who will
love and cherish him and be a mother
to him. It is good for this sort of man to
meet a decent widow, and it is good for the widow.
She has acquired the habit of looking after a man, and
if she cannot get another she will have to get a parrot.
Surely no thinking woman, be she ever so unmarried,
would condemn another woman to keep a parrot.

In a cavity of the masonry at the new
tower of the Central Railway Station was placed
a glass jar sealed, containing coins, documents and
newspapers of the day. “Which,” said Mr.
Owe’Sullivan, “will show our descendants 50
years hence what we are doing to-day.” Appa-
rently the Owe’S. expects his immense station to
be rooted up in 1953.

The N.S.W. Supreme Court, by the mouth
of Justice Pring, has decided that pennies are not
instruments of gambling under the local Acts, yet
a Sydney stipendiary sent two lads to gaol for one
month each last week for gambling with pennies.
The Attorney-General released both lads, and
Carruthers has not yet tabled a motion of censure.
The following is an extract from a report
of the W.C.T.17. Conference recently held in
Adelaide: —
Committees on such topics as heredity and hygiene,
peace and arbitration, agricultural shows, purity, mercy,
and opium, and doing work among cabmen, sailors,
miners, shearers, household helpers, and numerous other
sections of the community, are connected with the insti-
tution, and are booked on the agenda for the presentation
of reports. The scope of the union is as comprehensive
as life itself. The principal influences at work are per-
sonal example and the dissemination of temperance
literature.
The habit of tackling too many things at once is
here manifest. There are too many committees.
When Mrs. Brown, living a quiet, retired life in
Adelaide, finds herself on the committee for the
reformation of shearers, and also on the one for
urging the Great Powers of Europe to arbitrate
instead of going to war, and for imploring the
Venezuelans not to revolushe, there is always a
chance that some insufficiently-reformed shearer
will cus3 while Mrs. Brown is busy elsewhere.

Vic. Education Minister Sachse showed
his fool mind conspicuously the other day when he
remarked to a deputation :
For the teaching of babbling infants it did not seem to
him that any very high qualifications were necessary.
Up to eight years of age practically no qualification
should be required.
This is dead against all modern educational ideas,
and against common-sense too. When plants are
young they demand most care.

The baby industry is a big thing in
Sydney. Consider this list of advts. from ono
recent issue (17/9/’O3) of S. M. Herald :
TXTANTED, a kind lady to adopt a Baby Girl, 2

Apparently the only address the baby has nowa-

N.S.W. Assembly should promptly quash
the proposal to lease Chief-Justice Darley’s
Katoomba house, Lilianfels, as a summer resi-
dence for the Governor-General at £OOO a year.
There is no reason at all why N.S.W. should
provide the G.-G. with a summer house; it
already maintains for him a mansion which is
utilised barely one month out of six. Further,
£6OO a year is far too high a price for Lilianfels,
which, it is rumored, has been under offer for a
sum which wouldn’t bring half of that in interest.
* * * *
A select committee of N.S.W. Anglican
Synod states, in effect, that the reason why the
Australian youth so rarely applies for holy orders
is that clerical pay is small, and no sufficient pro-
vision is made for old age and infirmity. In a
word, “No rum, no hallelujah.” Besides, the
bishoprics all go to imported men, except when
there is a bishopric of the damper-and-gunyah
variety on offer.
* * * *
S.M. Herald (23/9/’O3) prints the fol-
lowing :
TXT ANTED, thoroughly clean, honest ORPHAN
’’ GIRL, about 15, Prot., 2in family, home,
clothes, Is. week pocket-money, in return for ser-
vices ; open till Saturday.
The inducement is sufficient to make a clean,
honest girl of 15 slay her parents so that she may
be qualified to compete.
The Presbyterian General Assembly Com-
mittee (Melbourne) has formed an idea of the kind
that is peculiar to such gatherings of the godly.
After thanking a Castlemaine parson for having
protested against the introduction of Labor
politics into a Sawbath discourse, the P.G.A.C.
“instructed its executive to consider whether
steps could be taken to prevent meetings of the
same character being held on Sundays.” Why
not petition Irvine and Bent to pass a Bill for the
Suppression of Socialistic Sermons on Sunday ?
A largely increased police force, armed with
revolvers, might carry the measure into effect by
shadowing all persons suspected of the intention
to preach Democracy on the Lord’s Day, and
shooting them at the first mention of the Factories
Act.
There are people in the world who are
never happy unless they’re converting somebody.
Some time ago certain enthusiasts in Melbourne
laid themselves out to bring the Jews round to
Christianity. A recent meeting, however, con-
vened by advertisement, inviting “Christians of
the Jewish race” to attend did not show en-
couraging results. The only persons present were
the two gentlemen who convened the meeting.
* * * *
N.S.W. Anglican Church had a Synod,
the other day in Sydney, and a religious paper
publishes with some pride a list of the occupations
of the lay members :
Eighteen solicitors, thirteen merchants, twelve graziers
and farmers, sixteen civil servants, one soldier, ten clerks
in Holy Orders, three journalists, seven masters of
schools, five barristers-at-law, nine accountants, seven
clerks, five doctors, three builders, one Senator, two
printers, two architects, one District Court Judge, three
tradesmen, one M.L.0., two custom-house agents, two
bank managers, two commercial travellers, three com-
mission agents, four storekeepers, three warehousemen,
four auctioneers, two orchardists, two estate agents, and
one each of various other professions, whilst twenty-five
persons are styled “ gentlemen.”
Not a carpenter or a fisherman or a laborer of any
kind ! It goes ill with a church which cannot
muster to its councils one of the horny-handed, in
a country, too, where the average intelligence of
the horny-handed is so high.

The Horsham (Vic.) magistrates have
severely admonished and imprisoned for four
hours a lad of 13 who stole a postal note. He was
employed by a mail contractor, and had to ride 60
miles every day with the mails. The rest of hi 3
time he did odd jobs about his employer’s house.
And the wages were five shillings a week and
“found”—perhaps “lost” would be a better
word.

There was begun in Sydney, t’other day,
what is termed in legal parlance “a court of
inquisition,” before Edward Scholes, barrister,
and a jury of 14. This is the first court of its kind
held in N.S.W. for over half a century. It was
convened to test the question of the legitimacy of
one Matilda Clines, deceased, to determine
whether or not certain property should be confis-
cated to the Crown or pass to the deceased’3
relatives. Holman, Labor M.L.A., made his first
appearance as a barrister in the case.

Equity Judge Simpson decided in the case of
Blanche Tyson, in Sydney last week, that a woman
who obtains a divorce with alimony must continue
to receive alimony during her life out of her hus-
band’s estate even after the death of the husband.
“Till death us do part ” has been relied on by
many lawyers as the principle governing such
cases.
EVENING (UN) DRESS.
“I hear Miss Orlrite ‘came out ’ at the ball, the
other night.”
“I can quite believe it; I left early, and there
was a good deal of her out then.”
The other day an ancient person, who
described himself as a cabman, applied for
admittance to a Sydney hospital as a destitute
patient. He was in a dirty condition, but when
the attendants were about to prepare him for a
bath he objected vigorously. In undressing him
£834 in notes, cash, etc., was found ! How is it
that you rarely discover an unexpected rich man
who is not badly in need of a wash ? Perhaps tho
average miser’s wealth is simply the money ha
didn’t spend on soap.
A WET NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A mother with her brood of three,
Her bundles and a gamp,
Stands waiting—ah Iso patiently—
Beneath a yellow lamp.
Near by a boy is crying Post
To those that pass him—see,
He scorns the rain, but makes the most
Of opportunity.
A crowded car with sodden roof
Crawls slowly up the track.
The driver in his waterproof,
A dripping blot of black.
The great Post Office clock looks down
On all the life below.
And hour by hour he tells the town
That even Time must go.
The gutter’s flooded, lamps are lit,
Tired feet no longer roam ;
The blind is drawn, and under it
I see the light of home.
M.L.
W. FRANCIS CHAMBERS.
THE SLEEPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He is not dead, though o’er his head
The netting ivy creepeth ;
Though upstart weeds blot out his deeds,
He is not dead, but sleepeth.
Ay 1 though he lies where mortal eyes
See naught but gloom and sorrow,
At Death’s strong gates, he only waits
The dawning of To-morroiv I

THE VARNISHED BOARD*’
A WOMAN’S LETTER,
(Sydney, September 29, 1903.
Aly Dear Arini,—
• Crossley’s song season, opening last Thursday
in Sydney, has sped auspiciously so far; a full
-Town Hall and a full, glad welcome met the
singer on her return after nine years. Perhaps
the platform was purposely left unadorned in all
itscoldj stiff vvooden plainness that it might prove
the greater foil to the very decorative contralto’s
presence—a, long, slender, pale-blue presence
crowned with pale green leaves, a spring-like
picture. _ She stood smiling and bowing towards
three points of the compass with a deprecating,
so-good-of-you ” air, not usually associated with
ji star performer. After the audience had assured
if r enthusiastic hands that it remembered
she had been raised in Australia and that her
return in . the noon day of her splendor
was appreciated, Miss Crossley lifted up her
voice in the Italian aria “Caro mio ben”
—otherwise, “My Dearest One,” a century-
and-a-half-old melody with which we are
all fairly familiar, but not as Miss Crossley
sings it. It is a sweet, pleading, gentle entreaty
to some .beloved, heart to cease its cruelty. She
gave it its requisite measure of tears and tender
sentiment, but it did not give her pure, rich voice
the chance that it got later in “O that We Two
were Maying!” At the second concert her
singing of “When the Birds Go North' Again ! ”
mid (for a recall) “Rocked in the Cradle of the
Deep ” showed why she is so successful in
oratorio. I would like to hear her in “ Elijah.”
There is a reverential, vibrant quality in her
voice, that peculiarly fits it for the expres-
sion of the emotions of faith and hope and high
resolve.. Ada sings as if she said her prayers
every night, and never scamped them, no matter
how late the recalls kept her out of bed, and ais if
she thought in a reverential way. Everyone was
wishing that the programme held more songs set
in a majestic key. At the same time, hers is a
radiant voice, as was proved by her “ Sunshine and
Rain,” and Purcell’s “ Hark, the Echoing Air.”
No matter how sad her theme she never gives you
the dumps. '
. After her first number the platform' was a more
fitting background for the contralto. A proces-
sion of flower-laden ushers paced up, deposited the
offerings and returned for more—again and yet
again more. They trod the daffodil and carnation
path so often that benevolent Benno Scherek,
who helped to gather in the harvest of flowers and
stook them, was submerged in floral stars, baskets
and posies. One long gilt crook with a little
bunch of forget-me-nots and a tiny, worn, infant’s
shoe attracted the singer’s special attention.
At her second concert, Miss Crossley appeared
in a picturesquely crippled condition—a walking-
stick in one hand and Benno Scherek for a crutch
on the other side. One foot was in plaster-of-
Paris and a red woollen slipper. Skipping on the
morning of that day in a too large shoe, her ankle
turned and the ligaments were injured. Although
suffering somewhat Miss Crossley sang six songs
at a standing in the second part of the programme
and the loud applause that followed was meant
more as a tribute to her pluck and amiability
than as a demand for an encore number. .
The Crossley gowning runs to a long, straight,
clinging style. At her first concert she wore a
palo blue gauze silk, under an overdress of
glittering net, embroidered round the foot
and on the corsage with big sunflowers in
blue chenille with silver centres. On her second ap-
pearance she was all white and silver, and the skirt
of her govvn was heavily embroidered with raised
leaves and flowers. The third concert “creation”
was amber satin and cream lace. She does not jewel
much. A diamond chain and the Victorian order
usually adorn her. The last, presented by the late
Oueen, 13 fashioned of red enamel and diamonds
surmounted by the Imperial crown. It is worn
on a piece of purple ribbon, and is liable to be
given to a lady who manicures the King’s hands
as well as to the lady with one of the finest con-
tralto voices in the world. So, if I were Miss
Crossley, I wouldn’t be extra proud of it.
By way of a side light on the joys of being a
great singer—on one recent morning Miss Crossley
received 150 demands for signed photographs, and
this is not more than a fair day’s average. About
149 of the 150 pirates who boarded her in this
ruthless manner were complete strangers, and
they expected the singer to supply the photo-
graphs as well as the signatures j also, in many
cases, to stand the postage and pack the parcel
carefully, and address it legibly to Dingo Vale.
1 he distracted lady, who wants a little vest, states
that she can’t meet these demands*
Mrs. Mayoress Hughes (who of all our society
women shows the greatest ability to sit in a Big
Draught all through a Town Hall show without
turning blue), attended all the Crossley concerts.
On baturday night she was accompanied by the
violet-clad Monsignor Vay de Vaya; and on
Monday night, the most fashionable and crowded
of the series, the Bartons shared the Big Draught.
The enterprising American girls ! One oflier
has become, it is written, Empress of Corea. She
is the daughter of a Presbyterian missioner, and
was already in the harem under the name of
‘Om.” Her own name is Emily Brown. No
doubt the harem, with its dancing girls and sweet-
meats, was preferable to a Presbyterian home
where papa preached plain, flat-footed Hell!
Presently Corea s emperor may be seen dressed in
lifth Avenue clothes; with a bilk of exchange in
one pocket and treatises on grain elevators beef-
trusts, and hog-factories in another, and playing
baseball, or motoring. Australian girls don
seem to have any luck (although some of them
marry Chinamen). Their colored man seems to
be always of the penny plain variety. In England
there are 30 American women, holders of titles
acquired by marriage, and Germany has six
princesses and 19 countesses who are American
born. Italy, France and Russia have a good
snare. These marriages are a good advt. for
U.S.A. ; a proof of the bigness of the dowry
Uncle Sam can give his daughters, in exchange
for a title.
A friend of mine and his wife, who were house-
hunting recently in Hobart, were informed by a
female property owner with a long upper lip that,
after 24 hours’ deliberation, she was sorry to dis-
appoint the lady, but that she could not possibly
let her have the house because her husband looked
like an infidel. If you wear the restless expres-
sion of one who doesn’t believe in the Mercury
and Hobart’s sparkling Rivulet, then you are set
down as an infidel, and the Commonwealth’s small
kitten will have none of you.
Two ancient Sydney families were joined in the
“holy bonds ’’ last week, when Dr. P. Sydney
Jones, third son of Dr. P. Sydney Jones, of Strath-
field, and grandson of Mr. David Jones, M.L.C.,
was united to Miss Constance Myles, of Dingadee,
Burwood. The bride is granddaughter of Mr.
Myles, an old-time Commissioner of Police and
builder of Myles’ Buildings on the “ Robks,” the
big weather-beaten terrace on the sky-line.
A charwoman under regular engagement for
scrubbing purposes at a fashionable dancing
school in-Sydney, went last week as usual to fulfil
her duties. On arrival, however, she was informed
that her services were no longer required, the
scrubbing job having been given to a lady who
contracted to take payment in dancing lessons.
A Truck Act ought to be wide enough to get at
the academy which persuades its charwoman to
take out her wages in airy gambols on a large,
well-worn toe.
Jacques Jacobs, violinist of the Ada Crossleyco.,
is a short, broad, curly young man who does not
look mangel-wurzel fed. A man playing a fiddle
is always an unsightly object, and Yacks Yakobs
has even less of a pink lily aspect at the work
than other violinists I have seen. At the first
Crossley concert he got a flattering hearing,
and a laurel wreath, which he accepted as
if it had been a laundry bill. Local violin-
ists are saying that he has wonderful ex-
ecution and tone and technique—in fact,
that he has a lot of wonderful attributes, in-
cluding “soul.” “Soul” is a very indefinite
thing ; no two people agree as to what it is, and
those who say they know what it is have great
difficulty in describing it, and some influential
ironmongers have doubts as to whether there is
any such thing; but whatever it is, and assuming
there is such a thing, some people are quite sure
Jacobs has it.
A fashionable and political gathering helped to
make history at the laying of a corner-stone of
the new Sydney railway station last Satur-
day. Wet flags, an ocean of wet umbrellas,
dingy, bad-weather clothes, and mud, mud,
mild. Premier See spoke under an umbrella
which was held over him with tender care by a
politician who is doing his best to put the See
Government out. Mrs. O’Sullivan held a rain-
shade over her own .especial Minister, and her
daughters stood on a lower platform and made dis-
respectful remarks about foundation stones. Mr.
O’S. quoted some stirring lines from the
poet Campbell, who prophesied the building of
such structures as this railway station in these
parts, but who omitted to say if the Owed
Folks. at Home would supply the money. It was a
beautifully-ordered function, and no one ever saw
a man with vine-leaves in his hair so gracefully
and lightningly removed as was an offender who
interjected whilst the Premier was speaking.
Two big men in blue elasped him on either side,
and the shamrock shot forward as if he had been
dynamited horizontally.
Quite interesting to look over the names in the
Queen s House Music Society (started and con-
ducted by Percy Grainger, in London) and note
the. Australians. Mrs. Conway Gordon, the
beauty of late Richard Speight’s family, appears
among the contraltos. She lives with her aristo-
cratic husband’s family—for the husband himself
did-n t turn out quite an archangel. Mrs. Zebina
Lane is another of the contraltos, and amongst
the baritones are Rupert Bunny, the artist who
painted Melba’s portrait, and Henslow Orchard,
who conducts one of the Sydney musical societies.
Queens House is where the Rossettis lived—in
Clieyne Walk, Chelsea. It is now occupied by
Mrs. Frank Lowrey, a Blessed-Damosel-looking
hostess who allows Percy and his chorus to swamp l
her house—in the name of St. Cecilia.
Crick-Slattery slander action, to which the
public had been looking forward with perfectly
disinterested interest, has been settled privately,
on terms not unfavorable to the wily T.M.S.
Have you seen the tissue-paper hats ? Our girl
friends are making and wearing them on one and
the same morning—white, pink, or blue hats made
up of tissue-paper plaited, and wired. Their one
fault is that they are rather heavy. But they look
like chip straw.
Stated on good authority that a woman and two
children are regularly employed by N.S.W. tram-
way autocrats to traverse the different routes. The
woman generally tenders incorrect fares for the
children, and if they are accepted a report of the
occurrence goes into the Department, and. the
guard is called on for an “ explanation.”
The Royal. Sydney Golf Club is embarking on
an ambitious scheme to acquire some square acres
or land between Bondi and Rose Bay. At present
the club ha,s temporary possession of the paddocks,
and it realises that its occupancy will soon be
challenged by the spread of settlement. The new
tram extension has changed the howling waste of
a. few years back to the “ very desirable subdivi-
sjori of the real estate auction man. Already
the lives of the stray rooster and wandering
gander are in danger from the flying golf ball,
while the increasing holiday traffic along the roads
which run through the links is a positive nuisance
to the Royal golfer. So it is proposed to
boldly buy up the territory at a cost of £20,000.
It is the “thing” to belong to the “Royal
j-yoneyS’ _ and scores of persons who grudge
na i? n °^ er directions, cheerfully pay
be members, though they don’t know &
golf bunker from a coal bunker, and could not play
over the links to save their lives, and wouldn’t
know a golf ball if they saw three of it hanging
above a pawnbroker’s shop. The committee thinks
xt will find no difficulty in placing 20,000 £1 shares
among those anxious to be part of the swell con-
cern, and already one or two have asked for £lOOO
worth each.
Miss Ruby Bowriug, a popular Sydney soprano
singer, is engaged to be married to Mr. L. B.
Hunter Fincham, of St. James Park, Hawthorn
(Vic.).
Writes my Melbourne correspondent: —
“The Austral Salon has gained some public
interest through the recent demonstration of
handicrafts. In turn, the Commonwealth Exes.,
the State Exes., and the journeymen Exes, did a
patrol of the exhibition, the result being that the
crowd rolled up and the show ‘went.’ Once it
was believed that the Salon was the Mecca of
matrons too heavy for light amusements, but not
stodgy enough to remain at home and label
the jam, or darn worsted hose. But the recent
outbreak suggests that most Salonites can draw or
daub or point-lace, or invent a hen-coop, or
embroider a novel crib, or show a talent of one
kind or another.
“Mark Hambourg, so the story goes, loves the
Sydney girl more fondly than , her Melbourne
sister, whom he accuses of ‘ coldness.’ It chanced
while he was here that he went to a picnic in
company with a goodly band of maidens and
others. The day was sultry, .and the pleasure-
seekers were only halfway up the gully when they
.heard the babble of a mountain brooklet amid the
fern. The lion of the day flung himse.lf on the
ground, exclaiming, thirstily, ‘Now, who would
like to bring me a cup of water from the stream ? ’
No one answered, so, after a surprised pause,
Mark, struggling into a sitting position, announced
severely, ‘ Melbourne girls are slow in comparison
with those of Sydney. Now, had I begged a cup
of cold uiater from them, in one instant the ladies
of Sydney, fleeing to bring it, would have vanished
away—away —away ! ’
“At Mark’s Sydney hotel lie was wont, when
so disposed, to receive visitors, sunk back on a
couch, his eyes closed and his mind sealed, seem-
ingly. to all but thoughts of his music. Here, the
average caller was less complaisant, or ‘less sym-
pathetique—less intuitive.’ Did Mark button his
eyelids during a chat, Mrs. or Miss Melbourne
would not deliver her message in hushed tones
and steal away, leaving the dreamy seer to his
vision. Rather, she waited till he appeared to
wake, and then went on talking in businesslike
tones. If he drowsed a second time, she rose and
swept off, with an offended, tread of some size. ,
“Men, in general, credit women with petty
spite and paltriness. Sometimes ‘ large-minded-
ness ’ is as little at home Under waistcoats as
beneath frock-bodices. Observe the case of that
asylum superintendent, recently mulcted in
damages for alleged slander against his ex-
colleague (formerly matron of the same institu-
tion). Good friends to begin with, their mutual
esteem failed to stand the strain of official wear
and tear. Among other absurdities, it came out
in court that defendant had directed the hall-
porter to compile notes concerning all the
matron’s visitors and their doings. These Paul
Pry notes provided a merry 15 minutes for court
loungers. The menial didn’t know the names of
the visitors, so he described them by their hair
and the way their clothes dragged behind them.
“The encroachments of a fashionable foreign
costumiere upon the habitations of a little artistic
circle in Melbourne affords an interesting com-
mentary on the relative positions of mere Art and
Drapery. The lady started in a very small way
in one corner of a Collins-street building, the
remainder of which was devoted to artist’s studios,
Longstaff and others being located there. With
the rapid expansion of the costume business one
after another of the artists received notice to quit.
There are now only two left, and one of these,
sculptor Summers, will be leaving in a few weeks
in order to let the foreign lady put in thirty or
forty more girls to sew Cup costumes together.
The remaining man is away up at the top of the
building, and Madame is putting off to the very
last the necessity for climbing several flights of
stairs. But the last of the artistic fold can read
his doom through the skylight.
“Ada Crossley is to sell at the Australian
Church bazaar almost as soon as she arrives. She
always said that Dr. Strong’s church would be one
of the first places to receive her home-coming
homage.
“Fritz Mueller’s last appearance hereabouts,
before he makes for Vienna, drew a big audience
to Kew Recreation Hall. It was an interesting
little entertainment, because, besides gifted Fritz
himself, the programme included work by several
enthusiastic young musicians, students at Mar-
shall-Hall’s conservatorium. Fritz’s platform
demeanor is refreshingly boyish.
“The knee exercise of one or two sorrowing
Magdalenes in ‘ Resurrection ’ makes the truly
religious and un-Christian alike squirm. The
sackcloth of the true penitent is never visible, and
her tears are mostly spilt in secret. A recovered
soul praying before a Greek Church image
in the midst of the harridans of the prison
yard is a ludicrous incongruity. The. thing
is farcical. Likewise the final tableau where
the repentant sinners, Katusha and Dimitry,
.pose in their purification—the former on abject
knees before the crucifix, the latter with a
princely .hand halting in benediction on the
Magdalene’s head—is one that sends many away
smiling. A more natural figure of woe is the
tall, vacant-eyed woman who, with streaming
hair and hands locked overhead, moans in-
coherently for the child she has slaughtered.
“There are two military swells'in the city who
hold similar rank and surnames. It is awkward
—and also convenient. One is a bachelor, and
t’other a widower. Both are big figures in the
circle of Frill. Both are favorites. Every week
the wicked gossips engage one o» t’other to some
widowed matron or some fashionable maid. When
friends congratulate them, as friends do, .'half,
maliciously, the defence of each is : “ Oh, it’s the
other fellow ! ”
“A dear, fussy, old dame, who often exploited
the sentiment that money was the special prero-
gative of the vulgar, has just been bequeathed a
fine fat sum by a clerical relative. A wide circle'
of friends wonder how this wealth will be diffused.
Will the dear old soul find it incompatible with
her fixed ideas to take possession of the vulgar
hoard ?
The latest avenue for the female worker is a
scheme for turning out a dinner spree on an elastic

s u , s *'. ess rings up the feast-maker on the
phone, gives information relating to the prospec-
tive spree—the number to he dined, the wines to
be tabled, and so on. The voice at the other end
quotes her price—and the thing is done. It is
then only necessary for the guests to arrive.
“ The order of Carlos 111., a Spanish decoration
bestowed upon Consul Henry Cave, adds a gew-
gaw to the gold-braided coat of that impressive-
looking person and sheds reflected glory on his
smart wife. The lady does much to make her
Armadale home more than a tea-and-twaddle
centre for her friends. It is an assembling place
for the soulful who struggle with German litera-
ture and its words of 362 letters. Music, mediaeval
armor, aboriginal tools of defence and curios,
are other features of the Cave house.
“For the Melb. Hunt Club meeting people’
came out in strong force and short skirts. Gov.-
Gen. Tennyson, wearing his walnut boxer to lee-
ward and a jovial smile at a like angle, scornedl
the carpeted sanctuary of the tent and kept in the
open with the Waxcellency. He quite ‘ knockedl
about ’ and occasionally got swept into a vortex of:
the farming fraternity (always strongly'in evidence-
at'the Hunt meeting), and was gathered to the-
elect again only after hard lhanceuvres of „ex tri-
cation.
1 “ The smart girl is beginning to favor an*
execrable fashion in head-gear—a saucer-shaped-
toque with a twist or two of shot ribbon on the
crown. It’s not the shape to suit any of;'
the faces that Providence has at present in use..
For a charmer with a Grecian nose it becomes am
absurdity to have a bold saucer rim curling up>
from her fair brow, and it is grotesque in the-
extreme to,see a snub nose curling up after it. A
saucer hat 1 Isn’t the mere name of the thing,
enough for anyone ? Think how a Gainsborough
provokes thoughts of terraces and lawns, of gay-
knights and sweeping graces. And how a picture
hat lures the fancy, and how a ‘ flop ’ provokes the
heart to flippancy and frivol! But a saucer hat 1
“ By the death of Mrs. J. M. Templeton the
poor lose a staunch friend, and the Baptist flock
one of the most shining of good examples.
“Touring Australians, visiting New York, are
impressed by the ‘American smile,’ with its
revelations of up-to-date dentistry. A diamond,
twinkling in a front tooth, is quite common ‘over
thar.’ Much newer are the colored artificial
teeth, displayed by Yank beauty-actresses. At a
hotel favored by theatricals, a simple stranger
from far Geelong watched a blonde belle
coquettishly contrast her blue-enamel biters with
snowy meringues, while at another table a bru-
nette charmer let observers see for themselves how
‘cunningly’ her dental-furniture of pink coral
suited the simultaneous flash of her gypsy eyes.
“A certain smart set is disappointed that
Representative Isaacs was, after all, left out of
the Federal judiciary. Not that it matters to
the set how well or how badly he would exercise
the powers of judgeship, but he is the husband of
a charming woman. Mrs. Isaacs is showy and
extremely clever. She is a linguist, a conver-
sationalist, a decided poseuse of a picturesque
order, an occasionally decorative frocker,' and
almost a wit. More than that, she is popular.
So that a large section of Society regrets that her
busy and ambitious spouse failed to be Benched.
‘ ‘ So far, Railway Commissioner Tait has loomed
largest as a Society figure. He is a front-ranker
to an obstinate degree. It’s neck or nothing. He
pilots his wife carefully, bestows her on the
smartest coterie in sight, and then himself sets
about falling into step with those males worth
while. As a railway reformer he is yet to arrive.
Up in his Spencer-street department there is a,
vague belief in him, and they say, ‘ Wait a while-
and he’ll get right there. ’ So far, he’s only got:,
right there in Society ranks.
“Senator Glassey is the idol of the telephone-
girls, whom he has befriended many a time andrj
oft. The other day, he took P.M.-G. Fysh im,
tow through the tube department, trotted out the-
fairest spokeswomen, and enlisted the sympathy,-
of the white-whiskered chief on the spot.
“ Two breach-of-promise cases from which great;
revelations were expected have been amicably
settled, and the feelings of the jilted pair have-
been solaced by large sums. Nemesis is working;
overtime just now.
“The girl-golfer is sticking to her favorite:
sweet frilled hat, but the hardier dame shows a.
tendency to the cork helmet. This is a replica of
the style once associated in our minds with Indian
colonels, but popularised a little by middle-aged
family men during the last two or three hot
seasons. I saw some helmets modelled for female
heads at a Collins-street store, and hear there’s a
demand for them because of lightness, shade, and
comfort—by the golfers of. the downright sort.
Those who wear sweaters on damp match-days,
and leggings, are, likely enough, ready to don the
white helmet, no matter what severity and for-
midable lines it gives the countenance. The true
she-sport says, ‘ Hang appearances.’
“In furniture one notes symptoms of a re-
action against the present Arcadian or Watteau
style, with its flowery chintzes, all shepherdesses,
wreaths, and lovers’ knots. Dresden china colors
and curtains and cushion slips of fresh white
muslin will soon be back numbers. So much the
worse for. the owners of small rooms ! The new
furniture fabrics show more decided colors, varie-
ties of rose, brown and gold, recalling the bygone
craze for ‘art shades.’ The Durbar, no doubt,
has whetted the world’s appetite for color feasts.
In design, the new chintzes seem akin to the con-
ventional patterns of ‘aesthetic’ times. People
fresh from England renovate their rooms with big,
handsome, plain curtains, and large, square
cushions showing mediaeval tulips, or daffodils, or
scrolls trained up against their groundwork like
saints on stained glass. Very effective and decora-
tive, methinks, when employed in spacious apart-
ments.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

CURE THAT WEARY
SPRING FEELING.
You know it! The languor and the weariness—the loss of appetite —the touch of indigestion —the
irritation of the skin. They all come with Spring.
All these ills are banished by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They enrich the blood—brace up the nerves—
banish indigestion and chase all Spring weariness.
Just as new sap strengthens the trees to stand the Summer heat—so Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
strengthen men, women and children with rich, red blood.
They’re just the tonic you need for this Spring.
“ Last Spring-1 had that wearv, fagged-out feeling,” says Miss Alma Jones, 75 Albion-st., Surry Hills, Sydney. “ I grew
weak and listless, and just trailed my legs after me. Horrible sick headaches made me heavy and drowsy, and I felt more
dead than alive. I had to fSrce mvself to eat, for the very sight of food often turned me sick. Sometimes dizziness actually
blinded me, and I went into a lead faint. At last I got so bad that I had to give up business. Although I took common
tonics and doctors’ medicines until I hated the sight of a bottle, I got no better. Then Mrs. Goodhead told me how much
good Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People did her. She made me get some at Pattinson’s, and they started actually to
make new blood for me. Everv day I felt better. I got new life and energy from every dose. Six boxes made my blood so
pure and rich that now I never get tired. To-day I am a strong, healthy-looking girl, without a trace of that weary Spring
feeling.”

A correspondent writes about the old-time
convict Sir Henry Hayes (B. 3/9/’03):
When Governor Macquarie arrived with the 73rd
Regiment and displaced the old and smellful New South
Wales Corps, Sir Henry Hayes became a great favorite
with the officers
of the 73rd. He
kept open
house at Vau-
cluse and the
officers were
not backward
in accepting his
hospitality. It
worked the
oracle for him ;
after being 12
years in exile,
Hayes was in-
formed that the
Prince Regent
had extended
to him a free
pardon. One
version of the
story is that
Hayes’ daugh-
ter m e t and
danced with
the Regent at
a ball, and so
touched the
heart under the
huge royal
waistcoat that
the pardon
was granted on
her entreaty.
Sir Henry sold

Colonel O’Con-
nell of the 73rd
(who in turn
sold to Captain
Piper, who sold
to VV. C. Went

took a passage

crew remained on Eagle Island until rescued by a gun brig
sent from Buenos Ayres. Late in 1813 Hayes reached his
home at Mount Vernon. He tried to regain his social
position but failed. He lived many years and was buried
in the crypt under Christ Church, Cork. Miss Pike, as
proved at Hayes’ trial, was detained only a few hours, her
friends having stormed Mount Vernon and rescued her.
Joey Bell, the spick-and-span Queensland
Minister for Lands, is the eldest son of Joshua
Peter Bell, one of the Queensland pure merinos
of the early sixties. Joey recently married a
daughter of Senator Ferguson.
“ I don't wish to cause any heartburning,
but there was not any Prime Minister I met in
the Mother Country who could fill his seat as well
as I did —and I am still growing.”—Seddon, com-
paring the Maorilander and the Englander.
F. H. Bruford, the new Victorian Auditor-
General, originally in the Customs Department,
was first brought to the front by J. B. Patterson
when Minister ot Customs. He used to write the
statistical portions of J.B.’s speeches for him.
A bookmaker in one of the Australian
capitals, who, some years ago, owned a house
worth at least £5OOO in a fashionable suburb and
ran his own horses, was lately fined for making a
penny book with newsboys in a city right-o’-way.
The depressed-looking Drake, who only
got into the Federal Cabinet by the untimely
death of his predecessor, has now held three
different portfolios—as P.M.G., Minister of
Defence, and Attorney-General, all within two
months.
Miss Vida Goldstein, the pretty little lady
who is about to seek election in Victoria to the
Federal Senate, confesses that she is 32 years old.
“You see,” she remarked to an Adelaide inter-
viewer with a touch of coquetry, “although
people in Melbourne think I am only 25, one has
to be 30 before one is qualified to sit in the
.Senate.” Miss Goldstein is only a dress reformer
to the extent of keeping her skirts clear of the
pavement, but is not' a sufficiently' advanced
woman to have a pocket in her dress yet.
Years ago, when the present Justice Dash-
wood was in Adelaide, Kingston had a business
appointment with him, which he failed to keep.
The irate Dashwood, after waiting for an hour
or so in the private room at Kingston’s
office, indignantly scattered all his Briefs,
papers, etc., over the table, turned his
room upside-down, and, boiling with out-
raged dignity, left a message that King-
ston would “find a memo, for him on
the table.” Kingston stored up the
episode in his mind. A time came
when he had an appointment at Dash-
wood’s office, which Dashwood failed ;
to keep. Kingston emptied Dash-
wood’s coal-scuttle on the table, heaped
the furniture on top of it, strewed the
contents of the waste-paper basket on
the floor, and left a message that Dash-
wood would find a complete explana-
tion on the table. Thereafter, those
two unpunctual men always kept ap-
pointments with each other.
A long-overworked and brainy
enthusiast, who is now a member of
the Australian Parliament, once sought
in the course of his desperate struggle
for a crust to supply a Sydney suburb
with cheap mullet—a whole cartload
of them. But meat was cheap then,
and the weather was hot —anyhow, at sun-
down the future member found himself
with a cartload of fish that simply had to
be disposed of—if possible, without attract-
ing public attention. The legend closes
with the pathetic picture of a tired father
driving his cart up and down the suburban
by-roads late into the night, his little son in
the back of the cart dropping stale mullet at
judicious intervals, pausing to rest the horse
and throw out much mullet when they came to a
vacant allotment, and whipping him past the
council chambers, where no mullet was disposed
of.
N. J. Brown, Speaker of Tas. House of
Assembly, who died Sept. 22, was a native of
Hobart, born in 1838, so he was almost old enough
to be a tradition. In July, 1891, he succeeded
Thos. Reibey as Speaker. Reibey is still alive,
aged 82 years.
John See, E. W. O’Sullivan, and Dan
O’Connor made quite a picture at the laying of
the corner-stone at the new Sydney railway-
station. It was refreshing to see Dan holding
an umbrella over John while the latter was read-
ing railway statistics.
A prominent Queensland politician will
probably “ go up King-street” very shortly unless
something unforeseen happens. The Jews and
Christians have been pecking at this unfor-
tunate for years, the result of too much confidence
in Mt. Morgans at £l6 10s.
Robert Ledger, a Benalla (Vic.) business
man, recently received a silver medal from the
Admiralty in recognition of services rendered
over 42 years ago as a sailor on H.M.S. Niger off
the M.L. coast. There is no unseemly haste or
flurry or jump about the Admiralty.
Edward Miles, master mariner, who got
the Braddon Ministry into such awful trouble
over his Strahan harbor contracts, and had to
drop out of Tasmanian politics, is announced as a
candidate for the Federal Senate. This is about
the most unkind thing that has yet been said
about the Senate.
Justice Barton has acted several times as
Supreme Court Judge on circuit in N.S.W. ; and
while doing that work his most striking character-
istics have been extreme deliberation and almost
painful slowness. But “the Bar” of country
towns always welcomed his appointment; even if
the session lasted only two or three days there
was “ a little dinner to the Bar ” at the end of it.
Chief Justice Griffith and Justice Barton
graduated M.’sA. at Sydney University in the
same year, 1870. Barton, however, went straight
through with his course, and took the academic
honor at 21; Griffith, though he was B.A. at 18,
let six years pass before he took the next step.
Griffith’s admission to the bar dates from 1807;
Barton’s from 1871. Justice R. E. O’Connor is
also a Sydney Uni-man.
Federal Justice O’Connor likes to keep
“in good nick,” and one of his pastimes is run-
ning. One morning recently he was doing a
sprint round Melbourne Parliament House grounds
minus hat and coat, when a new policeman on the
beat gave chase. O’Connor continued his pace,
but the “force’’ran him down and laid violent
paws upon him. Then a trembling brother of the
baton apologised, and was thanked for providing
a novel and exciting turn.
A certain new Southern high Parliamen-
tary official is the man who used to com-
pose his twaddlesome speeches as he lay abed
at night, and awaken his wife to listen
to the peroration. At about 2.30 a.m. she
would be called upon to express her drowsy
approval of his stereotyped rhodomontade,
beginning—“ And now, Mr. Speaker,” whilst the
orator sat up in his bed with one hand beating the
air and the other holding a glass of water from the
wash-stand bottle.

The Victorian House of Landlords has
elected old “Nick” Fitzgerald Chairman of Com-
mittees. Fitzgerald is a voluble Irishman, with
rheumy eyes and a wild, whirling style; at one
time he was a wealthy man. The Chair only carries
a salary of £4OO a year. As soon as the death of
Fred. Brown, the late chairman, was announced,
Fitzgerald’s friends •• Wised each other to the
effect that Nicholas wu*> • as well-to-do as
formerly. The chairmanship has been a sort of
refuge for the poorer members of the House for
many years past.
A Victorian railway inquiry board lately
acquitted one of the loco.-drivers—an ex-striker —
of the heinous charge of “refraining from con-
versing with his fireman. ” The driver in question
was James O’Connell, the plucky, ambitious
individual who put in a long succession of night
shifts on his engine that he might attend Univer-
sity lectures by day, and is now M.A. and B.Sc.
of Melbourne University. It should be a fair
thing now to haul up Bent before O’Connell on a
charge of “ refraining from conversing grammatic-
ally with anybody.”
“ ti.” : There is an excellent notice of
John O’Shanassy, by G. C. Levey, in the supple-
ment to the Encyclopaedia Bkitannica. He
and Higinbotham are the most states-
manlike figures in Victorian history.
Like Wentworth, he began as
Radical, and ended as
Tory, wherefore such men
are to be rather discounted
when they call the people
fickle. The right way to spell
the name is O’Shanassy, as it
appears on a tablet in St. Pat-
rick’s Cathedral, and nobody
knows why he adopted the other
spelling. He was a very large man
with a small voice. None had such
a considerable share in laying the planks
of the Victorian constitution and the
financial arrangements needed at that era.
O’Shanassy’s earliest Melbourne experiences in-
cluded a spell as a publican at an inn called the
B.ack Boy, and another as an Elizabeth-street
butcher.
It is reckoned that the Seddon family now
draws £5OOO a year in public service salaries in
Maoriland. Old man Seddon, save in his Jingo
and Union Jackass moments, is far more than
worth his salary, but the others seem to be mostly
paid for being related to old man Seddon.
Frederick Spencer, the W.A. Auditor-
General, who recently reported the Treasurer for
using a swear word to him, is retiring on a pen-
sion at the end of the year. Gardiner, the
Treasurer, who did the alleged swear, retires from
the Ministry after delivering the Budget speech
tl is month. Did all this arise out of one little
cu 8 word ?
Cowley, elected to the Speakership in
Bananaland Assembly, vice Morgan, the n«w
Premier, was billed to oppose Bamford, Labor
M.H.R. for Herbert (N.Q.) at coming Federal
election. Cowley, who is boss-director of the
Bank of North Queensland, is perhaps the most
consistent Kanaka-labor barracker in the State,
and now that the man who bears the nigger stan-
dard has decided to remain out of Federal politics
Bamford’s chances of re-election are much im-
proved. The Kanaka crowd will never rally
round anyone else as it would round nigger
Cowley.
Died at Ballarat, last week, nonagenarian
Dimsey (old Ballaratians are notorious for quaint
surnames), one of the originals in the .Band of
Hope G.M. Co., registered nearly 50 years ago.
Dimsey was the godfather of the mine, which
took its title from the Rechabite lodge he
happened to be ruling at the time. He was always
a staunch teetotaller and Methodist. Perhaps it
was because he ran a florist’s business that Dimsey
made a dying request for a very quiet funeral
with no flowers. As a dealer in comi>limentary
tributes to the dead he knew just how much they
were worth.
“ F.C.” : Evidently the strain of managing
a big company is severe. Clapp, boss-
director of the Melb. Tramway Co., smart Yankee
and one of the thinnest men who ever left a
land of lean men, looks very weary now. Of late
Jiis managership has been little more than nomi-
nal, just as is Sprigg’s secretaryship. The real
bossing and planning of the company is done by
a “plain brown man”—Horace A. Wilcox, who,
in the street, dresses like a storeman or caretaker.
A medium-sized, nondescript, unimportant-look-

Mr. John Bligh Suttor, cousin of F. 8.5.,
President of the Legislative Council, takes White-
ley’s place as N.S.W. Commercial Agent in the
Far North ; salary, £750 and liberal allowances.
In the preliminary sorting out of the candidates
Mr. Suttor’s claims were not supposed to amount
to much, yet as batch after batch was winnowed
he was found to survive. A whilom Sydney
commercial man, now an extensive speculator,
was favorite, but, owing to relationship, Premier
See vetoed him. Then came a commercial man
who had lived in China and Japan and talks a
number of languages. But at the last minute the
railway engineer—a very capable man in that line,
whose services to day labor even the Owe’Sullivan
hasn’t quite destroyed—slipped in.
It is a novelty to hear of a Minister of the
Crown throwing up his billet because of the
drudgery of signing his name to official docu-
ments. That seems to be the case with Lands
Minister W. P. Crick. It is true that in the
Lands Department the documents to be Ministeri-
ally initialled are exceptionally numerous. But it
should be possible to apply some mechanical
process to the work, instead of laboring over each
job with pen and ink. A few years ago visitors
to a N.S.W. Lands Minister were frequently
edified by the spectacle of an old gentleman
patiently and placidly signing document after
document, taken from a three-foot pile before
him. As he signed, about an inch of his tongue
protruded and followed the movements of the
pen. That Lands Minister delighted in the task.
He used to hurry over breakfast to get down to
the office table “to attach my signature.”
CUTTING THE CLOTH ACCORDING TO
THE REFORM LEAGUE.
Bent, Shiels, and Irvine still snipping and saving.
Died last week, Frederick Grew, the oldest
resident of West Maitland (N.S.W.), aged 96
years. He arrived at Sydney in 1830, and settled
at Wallis’s Plains (as West Maitland was then
known) in November of that year. The place was
named after Captain Wallis, of the 46th Ptegt.,
who was commandant at Newcastle in the ’teens.
Travelling by road from Sydney to Newcastle,
Mr. Crew said that he passed many gibbets, relics
of the convict system. The old gentleman told
weird tales of floggings and hangings, having a
clear recollection of seeing six men hanged for
“ sticking up ” a dray.

That advt., by lady chastiser, alluded to in a recent
Bulletin, to wallop damsels 16 to 21, seems to fill a long-
felt want. My experience of ladies between those ages,
and especially round about 16, has convinced me that
judicious walloping and hard tucker are the things they
stand most in need of. Once had the misfortune to teach
a class of them, and, with absolutely no encouragement,
90 per cent, persisted in falling in love with me ; in hang-
ing around after lessons, and in occasional hysterical
outbursts if spoken to in a tone savoring of severity.
One, kept for a few minutes to explain her unladylike
deportment at an earlier hour, flung her arms round my
neck and sobbed out, “ You don’t understand.” My oath
I did, but I wasn’t taking anything in the way of hysterics
and got her out in double quick time. The presence in the
same city of a professional walloper, who might be called
in at any time to cane premature amativeness out of
them, would have saved me most of my hair.
“E.S.S.” : JRe carpet and rock snakes
(“Caber,” B. 17/9/’O3). H. J. M'Cooey gave the
following information in Bulletin of January 20,
1900:
Let me say that the generic distinctions between the
rock snake (Liasis childrenii, Krefft) and the carpet
snakes ( Morelia variegata, Gunther) are simply these : In
Liasis the lower labial shields are deeply pitted; in
Morelia the anterior upper labial shields are pitted. Also,
in M. variegata the entire dorsal surface is beautifully
variegated ; whereas L. childrenii is in general .color,
dark olive green. Again, M. variegata never attains a
greater length than 13ft., whereas L. childrenii may
attain to a length of 24ft. In re distinctions between the
carpet and the diamond snakes. There is in reality no
specific difference between M. variegata and M. spilotes.
They both work out the same and are anatomically
identical. M. spilotes is spotted all over; and appears to
non-experts to be a different and distinct species; but
mere .color-markings are absolutely worthless in the
determination of a species. In one word Morelia spilotes
is not a valid species. It is simply M. var. variegata.
Liasis childrenii is known as the Children’s Rock
Snake, and I don’t think there are many who
have seen a specimen over 12ft. —half of what
M‘Cooey says they attain to. According to Gun-
ther and others, the largest specimens of boas and
pythons seldom exceed 20ft. ; and Krefft adds :
“An Australian rock snake of 10 or lift, must be
considered a monster.’’ Also: “_A diamond or
carpet which measures above 10ft. in length may
be more than 20 years old. ” At that age they
have ceased to grow, though they may continue
to extend in girth. All the python id as are known
as rock snakes. Besides those mentioned, Queens-
land has the olive-green rock snake {(L. olivacea),
black-headed snake (8 or 9ft.), Gilbert’s rock snake
( Nardoa gilbertii), and one or two others. As to
distinction between carpet and diamond snakes,
it seems rather strange that the diamond is
found only along a limited strip of the east
coast of N.S.W. —not further north than the
Richmond River; while the carpet, snake
is found in almost every part of Australia, icith
the exception of the particular habitat of the diamond
snake. Krefft treats them as two distinct species,
and states that “there is reason to believe that
carpet snakes attain even larger growth than
diamond snakes.” According to the “Natural
History of Australia ” (which isn’t very reliable),
“the maximum recorded length of the carpet
snake (15 or 16 ft.) is considerably in advance of
that (lift.) of the other kind.” (N.B. —The snake
season commences in earnest in October.)

“ R.R,” : Some remarkable accidents. I
was cantering along, t’other day, when a.little
stick flew up and penetrated the horse’s side so
deeply that he died a few hours later. I once
saw a cow choked between the wall of a
house and a straining-post. She had evi-
dently, in an attempt to reach a few green
leaves alongside the building, slipped and
fallen as described. Riding past a
cocky’s place one day, my greyhound
“spotted” a pet kangaroo and gave
chase. The ’roo made for the pro-
tection of a “milker,” bumped
her over as my dog was closing
in, and all three fell in a heap.
The ’roo was killed by the impact,
and the dog was fatally impaled
on the cow’s horn. As I saw
Mrs. Cocky coming, I didn't wait
to see how the milker had fared.

“Bon” announces the arrival in Mel-
bourne of one of the Owe’Sullivan’s oddities:
Having a political personage behind him he was
promptly pushed into a night-work billet in the Govern-
ment printing office. Arriving at work at 8 p.m., he was
supplied with a case and stick and told to lift “ copy."
“ ’Struth ! I aint a bloomin’ Sampson ; 'sides, where is
it?” “In the box, you idiot.” “Oh! thought yer
meant one of them South African joints.” Coiling his
legs round a stool he spent a full half-hour in gazing at
his case. Then approaching one of the comps, he asked,
“What game is that bloke in ther corner playin’?”
“ Dis-irig.” “Oh, that’s what they calls chuckin’ them
lead things into them funny little boxes.” Ten minutes
spent in emulation of the “ bloke in ther corner” pro-
duced a glorious state of “pye.” He next saw a couple
“ jeffing ” to settle the ownership of a piece of “ fat',”
and entered into the game with great zest. Nine o’clock
found him exhausted and inquiring what time knock-off
came. “Oh, about five.” “What! in the mornin’?”
“Yes.” “ ’Struth! this aint no place for me. I must
have me night’s rest. 1 Yer needn’t say nuffln’, but I’m a
butcher, and me night’s rest ” but just here he was
led out by a profane and perspiring printer, who returned
to his desk to pen a strongly-worded request to Authority,
asking if it knew the difference between a butcher and
a compositor, and if it didn’t would it kindly buy itself a
kangaroo to refer difficult questions to.

“ C.P.” : Some bush scientists do wonder-
fully good work considering their opportunities.
Near Alstonville, in the Big Scrub (N.S.W.),
lately, I dropped on H. R. Elvery, a self-taught
egg-collector. He has one of the best collections
of eggs in Australia, some of its features being
unique—notably pitters and rifle and regent birds’
eggs. His “clutches” of these are unsurpassed

Once upon a time two Big Scrub cedar-
getters were on the spree in Ballina, and a travel-

one of their dozen mates could tell the time. Nor
could the two clock-buyers.
“ C.H.R.” : Sketch in B. (9/7/’O3)
of lady and gentleman dining in economic
costume, reminds me somehow of a cleric
of my acquaintance who scared his family
and guests one morning by coming to
breakfast simply arrayed in his pants.
After a cheerful salutation all round, the
holy man took liis seat and asked a blessing
over the chops, while the guests nearly
carried the door off its hinges in their en-
deavors to escape, and Mrs. Parson fell
over the back of her chair in hysterics,
dragging over the breakfast service. The
groom and gardener wrapped their master
up in the tablecloth and carried him up-
stairs. Subsequently the rev. gentleman
appeared in private theatricals as a Spanish
nobleman. After the performance he went
home and went to bed with ’em all on, not
forgetting the tall boots and the spurs.
His wife thought the Russians had at-
tacked Tasmania and raised the street.
When the police broke in they found a
Spanish nobleman sitting in the shower-
bath, with a long feather drooping over one
eye, holding the Book of Jeremiah im-
paled on a dagger. He has since re-
covered, but Tasmania hasn’t.

South Australia badly wants the old
age pension. Travel along any of the roads
or tracks of that distressful State and you
meet old men in twos and threes “ travel-
ling.” Yes, that’s the word, for they
themselves don’t know where they are tra-
velling to, simply looking for a doss and a
bit of tucker. Some of these poor old
fellows are of great age—over 70 —and
some can hardly toddle along. In the
travellers’ hut at Oollingrove station one
day recently there were three men each
over 66, two over 64, and one in his six-
tieth year. There is no possible hope of
these men getting work, but they keep
on moving because they might fall down
if they stopped. It is all utter misery, utter
hopelessness, utter waste of boots.

Birth notice sent to Launceston Daily
Telegraph of August 22nd: —
On the 7th inst., at Arthur-street, Launceston, Mr. Arthur
Taylor’s Jersey heifer, Jersey Lily, of twins—son and
daughter—by Magnet Boy XII. All doing well. Father
proud, mother happy, owner jubilant.
The story of Polly :
Fate decreed that Polly be reared “ on
the land” in the usual "settlement”
slab hut of two rooms, which, when
lighted at night, showed the family on-
goings through the chinks. Also, Polly’s
widowed mother and sister. Sis were
good-looking and sel-
fish ; she, herself,
being unselfish, cross
eyed, and uncom-
promisingly plain.
She was a working-
bee while her mother
and sister were of
the queen-bee varie-
ty. The two “boys”
of the family had
fallen into mischief
and on to the State,
so mother and Sis
did the best they
could on their
“ own," which was
not much, while
Polly was a long-
suffering “general”
in a family of 10.
Thus had Fate borne
a grudge against her
from the start.
Daniel Morton had
“ walked out ” with
Polly for a year or
two, and, at last,
June-twelve- months
was fixed for the
wedding. Now did
Polly, in her Bft.
square of servant’s-
room, dream dreams
of four-roomed sub-
urban cottages, in-
habited by a happy
Polly and Dan and—
baby, for babies
figured largely in
Polly’s dreams. Then
Fate tempted Polly
to take Dan to see
Mother and Sis.
Mother took to Dan
—so much so that,
ere that June-twelve-
months came round,
she became M rs.
Daniel Morton, and, when the occasion arose, Polly was
invited home to welcome a baby step-sister, which the
mother exhorted her to care for, and then died.
Nothing daunted was Polly, and while step-father Dan,
as he put it himself, “turned himself round” —which
process in his case took considerable time—she supported
the baby.
Likewise her heart was healed by the love of Thomas
Meehan. Five-feet-six of large-hearted Australian youth,
he also “ walked out” with Polly, who was getting rather
near thirty. But in an evil moment fate caused Sis to
fall in Polly’s way, and Polly, seeing how things were,
got a room and nursed her and her little stranger when
the hospital had done with them. This brought Sis into
the view of Tom.
Sis was a long time getting strong enough to go back
to work ; in fact she only got strong enough to take a
trip to town and come back Mrs. Tom Meehan. . But
Polly had made up her mind to outwit fate and claim at
least part of her dream ; so, shortly before Sis presented
Tom with a son, Polly presented him With a daughter.
Now askillionis added to the old slab hut, and Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Meehan and son, and Polly and Polly’s daughter,
with step-sister Morton, and Sis’s daughter, Gwendoline
Jones, live together in a happy, casual Australian fashion,
daily awaiting the return of step-father Dan, who has at
last “ turned himself round,” and is coming home from
the West to go back “ on the land.’

Near the end of last year two miners
sinking a shaft on White Cliffs opal field found a
colony of large black ants in the heart of a solid
rock, about 30ft. from the surface. The insects
died soon after exposure to the air. There was no
passage or fissure connecting the cell with the
outer world. The ants and a portion of their
prison walls have been sent to Adelaide Museum.
ON THE TRACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I grope in my soul’s dim places,
In its chambers hung with black,
And peer till I find the faces
Of two on a sunlit track.
Oh, grey were the great bush spaces
That flung us our wild words back !
I laughed when I heard you sigh it—
“ Good-bye,” but no word I said,
The blood in my veins ran riot;
I stayed not your parting tread,
But watched till the dusk was quiet
And the fay sky-line was red.
When night, giving rest to the sleepers,
Hangs over the silent quay,
I list to the white surf reapers
With their scythes against the sea,
Till my soul has slain its keepers,
And the danger thoughts are free.
Day comes with its jar and wrangle—
I fret at the sunbeam’s glare ;
For what is their tinsel spangle
To the molten gold they were ? •
When you strove with the twisted tangle
Of the pine-cones in my hair ?
I yield to a dream entreating
Of a pathway known to two,
And shadowy branches meeting
Where the sunshine filters through—
But never a glance of greeting,
Or word as I pass by you 1

“Boori”: Re “H.S.”par. (11/4/’3O).
The amount of solid food a blackfellow
can surround is as wonderful as his utter
disregard of its nature. Like the emu’s,
the nigger’s stomach refuses nothing but
broken bottles. Writer once saw a black-
fellow, quite a little fellow too, stow away
a bandicoot, entrails and all, which must
have weighed at least_ 81b. As he sat and
stuffed, I could see him, like Dickens’ tea-
party guest, “swelling wisibly before my
very eyes.” On my drawing his attention
to the fact that he was swallowing some
of the hair, he merely grinned from ear to
ear and said, “Oh, that all right. Mak’em
Jimmy’s binjie blenty warm inside.”
“H.S.’s” account of the aboriginals’ mas-
sage treatment for indigestion reminds me
of something. A Sydney doctor once told
me that while travelling in the South of
France he noticed in many of the peasants’
houses a great cannon ball weighing about
501 b. sewn up in flannel. On asking the
use of it he was told that when the good
man of the house suffered from indigestion
he lay flat on his back and the good woman
rolled the ball in circles all over his stomach
until relief came.

“ Cicada ” : The fruit bats, popu-
larly known as flying foxes, like all other
bats,carry theiryoungon their breasts; they
do not hibernate. In the early days there
was a very large “camp ” at Elizabeth Bay,
and at the present time there are a number
of well-known “flying fox camps” in the
county of Cumberland. This despised bat
makes a very good dish if skinned and
curried; and the writer when in Papua
had many a good meal of fox thus treated
when other supplies ran short. The true flying
fox is only found in the south of Japan, the Indian
and Malay region down to Australia, in a few
islands of the Pacific, and in Madagascar.
Probably no other creatures congregate in such
numbers. In a large fox camp the multitudes are
past all counting.

“ H.H.C.” writes:
It puzzles Tasmanians when they read about the hard-
ship of the poor N.S.W. cookies having to eat kangaroo,
wallaby and other native game. In Tasmania such fare
is only for the wealthy city folk, and whenever a consign-
ment of wallaby arrives in Hobart the fact is always well
advertised. At the auction rooms you will find the gour-
mets of the drainless city bidding spiritedly for hind-
quarters of scraggy marsupial, often blue-mouldy from
being “ hung” too long. One well-known Hobart identity
—a re-incarnation of the late Garden Honey of Sydney—
is often to be seen hawking a handful of wallaby remains
about when he isn’t on the Risdon racecourse inquiring
anxiously “ Who’ll’ave a good cigar?” Never saw him
actually make; a deal in either line, but I know a wallaby
cannot be earned around by the leg more than three
months even in Hobart. Stopping for a day at an hotel on
the Midlands I was surprised at having my breakfast
choice confined to “ fried rabbit or stewed parrots.” For
dinner the menu was curried rabbit and “ kangaroo
steamer,” and I was the only guest who didn’t beam upon
the “steamer” with joy. Waitress looked hurt when I
inquired if there was any cold dingo on the sideboard.
Escaped by the train before tea-time. In the carriage
with me was the corpse of a kangaroo-rat, neatly done up
in ferns, and a proud sportsman who beguiled the journey
with full particulars of how he “ stalked it ” for hours
before getting in the lucky shot. He said his people were
very fond of “ rat steamer."

Some religious sects not before discovered
turned up in the Westralian census papers. Also
some unusually truthful persons seem to
have sent in returns. In a front place
among these latter was a man who kept
a pub. and said his religion was
“£.s.d.” The most promising new
sect is that of the “ Goldfields Chris-
tian.” It is small yet —the founder
hasn’t had time to make any converts
up to date. The “ Goldfields Chris-
tian ” is understood to look coldly
upon the Coastal Baptist, - and to
wash irregularly. There is also one
Hoke and one Hylozoist wandering
over the face of the goldfields, though,
so far, neither of these has estab-
lished a tabernacle. What kind of
religion is a Hoke ?
“ Rus ” : A far-fcoo-frequent
item in the “country news” of the
Sydney dailies is the threshing-
machine accident, Hard, dangerous,
and ill-paid work “ following the
thresher.’’ Sixpence an hour
sounds (comparatively) fair enough,
but broken time —through bad
weather, shifts, etc.—reduces the
total earnings to less than the aver*
age weekly wage ; and microscopic
dust, smut, heat, and sun-glare on
the straw make the work extremely
disagreeable. “ Thresher men ” are
mostly youths who follow the mill far
more for “ the fun with the crowd ” than
for monetary returns, for, even in a season
of good weather and plenty of work, the
cheques at the wind-up are almost invariably
very light.
“ Kauri ” writes :
A peculiar insect has been found in the hot springs of
Lake Taupo (M.L.). It is about half the size of an ordi-
nary fly, but more slender in proportion, and black.
Builds natural incubators, and is not catalogued in
zoological works. Supposed by some theorists to play an
important part in building terraces. At Rotorua there
are numbers of living creatures always in hot water as it
were. Fishes swim in wateFaroqnd there hot enough to
cook them, but by some queer provision of nature the fish
are not cooked, but simply grow coarse and ugly.
Some of the girls who go to the hot lakes for a periodical
resurrection should consider these fish and the possibility
that the water may, in time, make a girl look the same
way.

“T.J.L.”; Re food-adulteration. I once
saw a purblind Victorian dairyman take the can
of cream from the separator-room, instead of the
skim-milk, and empty it into the pig-trough.
The mistake was immediately discovered, and
most of the cream was recovered after a fierce
tussle with the swine. I was going to remon-
strate with the old man over the business, but
thought better of it when I saw how he handled
the pigs. The butter was on sale later in the
local store, but the trail of Dennis has been over
Mulvaney’s brand for me ever since.
“ R.N.L.” tells of how an aboriginal voted
in Victoria:
Medlar, as election time drew near, addressed me :
“ Of course, you’ll see that your blackboy records his
vote, Banks—and in the right way, too ! He has merely
to state that he is an aboriginal native residing in the
district.”
“I’m not going to the trouble of coaching him.”
“ Leave it to me,” said Medlar confidently. “ I’ll see
that he acquires a proper notion of his responsibilities.
I’ll take him in on polling day and see him vote.”
Early on election day he drove up and took Paddy
aboard. The township is 10 miles away, and Medlar made
the most of the opportunity. He began by telling Paddy
how pleased Queen Victoria would be when she heard
that he had helped to send Swingate (our candidate) to
Parliament. Paddy had heard of Queen Victoria, and had
witnessed the annual distribution of blankets to blacks in
the township on her birthday. Medlar went on to explain
how Paddy was to tell the “ big-fellow boss alonga court-
house” tliat he wished to vote for Swingate, carefully
impressing the name upon the boy’s memory. Paddy
absorbed instruction slowly, but whep the tin roofs of
Westaway showed through the heat-haze, Medlar’s pains
seemed not to have been entirely wasted. Medlar, with
Paddy, entered the polling-booth, and Medlar said : “ This
black claims a vote as an aboriginal native.”
“ Well,” said the returning-officer, “ ’tis the first time
such an application has come widin me experience. Let
me see.” He turned up his form of instruction.
“ ’Tis unregular," he said at length. “ But I’ll chance
it.”
“ He can neither read nor write,” said Medlar.
“ I’m insthructed to assist voters in such cases. Who
d’ye wish to vote for, me boy ? ”
“Queen Bictoria,” said Paddy.
“Hivinsi Who’s been beguiling ye?"
Medlar returned to interpose. “He wishes to vote
for ”
“ Hold your tongue, sir ! I allow no wan to interfare
wid electors 1 Who d’ye want to vote for, me lad ?”
Paddy, laying a brown forefinger on the officer’s coat-
sleeve, smiled insinuatingly : “ You got im planket?”
And Swingate lost that vote.
SPLITTING RAILS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There isn’t much in bush work, save a “ collar” here and
there,
And a man is rather lucky if he strikes it pretty fair.
But a toiler doesn’t change his occupation till he must,
And that is why I’m sticking to the splitting for a crust ;
And by dint of solid labor for a dozen hours a day
In the best of blaekbutt timber I can nearly make it pay.
I’ve got to tie my “bo-yangs” at the bottoms of my
pants,
To guard against ground-leeches and marauding soldier
ants;
But seldom that precaution for protection aught avails,
And I’ve moments most exciting every day a-splitting
rails.
Then before I start to scarf it I must test each blessed
tree,
For some, although they’re hollow, look as solid as
can be.
I never pick the biggist, for, of course, they’re mostly
rough,
And the smallest ones are “ ringy,” and a lot not straight
enough;
So I fell a medium blaekbutt that is minus twist or flaw,
And I quarter from the small end every section that
I saw,
Split the quarters into fence-rails then, and trim ’em with
the axe
Till they’ve finest feather edges and an even width o’
backs,
And though some are spoilt by running out in “ over-
growths ’’ and “ wales ”
I raise the blooming record for a day at splitting rails.
But though by going willing still a living may be won,
The signs are getting clearer that this graft is nearly
done;
Ay, the grand old three-rail fences that they gloried in
of yore
Aren’t standing round the homesteads and selections any
more ;
And you’ll hear the wind a-moaning weird and melan-
choly strains
Through the “ wire-and-dropper ” fences that are slung
across the plains.
Ah, well 1 the graft was heavy, but I’ve stuck to it so
long
That I’ve grown to like it somehow, and I’ll miss it pretty
strong.
But it’s going, for the market’s mostly glutted ; and the
sales
Only leave starvation wages for the man that’s splitting
rails.

put on some necessary article, which we now import to
the extent of £1,000,000 a year, a duty which stops im-
portation. The duty yields no revenue. But there is
work found for, say, 8000 extra artisans in making the
article locally. What you get out of these men and their
families (perhaps 30,000 people) in railway fares, tram
fares, income-tax, local rates, and duties on other articles
is profit-about £IOO,OOO a year profit Wombat

Aldon : Inclined to be namby-pambyish A.: What

D.M. : Don’t quite understand your soap poem,
but hereut is :
O I slippery, slimy and serpentine Soap !
I glidingly, grudgingly, gloomfully grope,
Banefully back at the base of my brain
In seeking to capture the cadence again.
Lost in the languishing, lingering light,
Dipped in a droyvsy, deep dream of delight 1
O ! sliding and soulful and sorrowful Soap 1
Must I then madly and mournfully mope ?
Broken my heart is,' and burning my brow.'
At last 1 an inspira —lost it 1 How now !
Gadzooks 1 Odsbodikins ! Marry, come up 1
Drink to the dregs the despairing, dread cup l
Flout in the face, of fierce failure and fling
Shouts to the skies 1 Saponaceously sing ! !
Grant me the grace of a moment’s release,
, Quiv’ring, calumnious compound of grease 1

KIDNEYS
THE HUMAN FILTERS.
Note the Following
Are They in Order?
1
On each side of the spine, in the small of the hack, is the position occupied by the Kidneys.
The Heart, through connecting arteries, sends down a continuous flow of blood to the Kidneys day and night;
the work goes on without cessation.
■■ >' > >
2
The function of the Kidneys is to extract from the blood about three pints of urine every twenty-four hours, and
are thus nothing more nor less than HXJdVJIA.3NT FILTERS.
Animal and mineral matter are contained in this urine, together with about
an ounce of urea, and ten or twelve grains in weight of Uric acid.
mmm
The great desideratum is for the filters, or Kidneys, to be in perfect order;
they must do their work completely, extracting all waste matter from the
blood. If not, the blood becomes contaminated, causing many serious
diseases and much suffering.
Healthy Kidneys mean Perfect Health.
4
The Kidneys must not be overtasked or neglected upon the first symptoms of
inflammation.
Inflammation means sick Kidneys, and sick Kidneys throw every organ out
of order.
m
Impurities and poisons are left in the blood, which give rise to Bright’s
Disease, Congestion, Diabetes, Inflammation of the Bladder, Gravel, Urinary
Troubles, Headaches, Fluttering of the Heart, Limb Aches, Dropsy, Bheumatism,
and the troublesome and well-known Backache. The urine will not flow in
the proper quantity, the patient becomes irritable, nervous, weak and languid,
and lapses into a restless, feverish condition, eventually becoming “ done up ”
entirely.
TEST
Everyone can, in a great measure, discover the condition of their Kidneys, by
the following simple test:
In the morning, place in a bottle some urine, allowing it to stand for twenty-
four hours ; if if then contains a sediment like brickdust, or if particles float
about in it, or it is unnatmal in color, milky and cloudy, the Kidneys are out of
order—they are sick, and immediate steps should be taken to repair these MOST
important organs.
The great indicator of diseased Kidneys is Backache.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There’s talk of a select committee being
asked for to discover to what extent Sunday labor
is carried on in Sydney newspaper offices. The
idea has a great deal to recommend it.
Tasmanian Assembly passed without dis-
cussion, t’other night, a Bill extending the suffrage
to women —this for the fifth time. Presently, the
House of Dodery will, also without discussion, for
the fifth time pass the Bill out; and so the dance
goes on.
Brisbane Courier, which has been de-
nouncing the Barton Government as the puppet of
the Labor party, is , now supporting the Morgan
Administration, which depends entirely upon the
local Labor party for its existence. Circumstances
alter papers.
Bent and Irvine have now instructed the
overworked country stationmaster and policeman
to constitute themselves honorary labor-agents for
the Victorian farmer. Why these sturdy beggars
■houldn’t advertise their wants in the local paper,
just as the manufacturer does, Heaven only
knows.
John Haynes, or whoever likes to move
in the matter, should, instead of again thrusting
the old contentious abolition of death-penalty
Bill at N.S.W. Parliament, move a Bill of a
couple of clauses allowing the jury to qualify its
verdict of “ guilty ” by
ad d i n g “ without capital
punishment.” Such a
Bill would probably
encounter little oppo-
sition in Parlia-
ment, and would
get as near to the
abolition of the
death penalty as
seems possible
at present.
MR. REID AND HIS PARTY.
“Speaking at. Parramatta Mr, Reid said he would
not issue any manifesto until he had fully con-
sulted the party he led, because it was no use having a
manifesto at variance with the principles of the party.”—
Daily Paper.
MR. REID : “Hanged if I know which way THIS
dog wants to go, so it’s not much use sooling
him on .”
The disorganisation of Vic. Education
Department is evidenced by the fact that it lias
among its servants one pupil-teacher of 26 years’
standing, and several of 18 and 19 years. The
“pay ” of these sweated unfortunates never rises
beyond £4B a year. And yet the excessive cost of
education is a favorite subject out Kyabram way.
G. H. Reid at Paddington :
If there was one mistake a public man ought to avoid it
was that of exaggerating the merits of himself or his col-
leagues before they had been subjected to the test of
experience.
Perhaps George had in his mind’s eye a certain
politician who once upon a time announced him-
self as the “ Chap to Save the Country ” —and left
the country unsaved.
Quinn and Meagher both figure on N.S.W.
Parliamentary business paper as authors of motions
for, practically, the abolition of the Legislative
Council. One or other should be able to force a
debate on the subject, if it is possible to drive the
disorganised Legislative wreck into any kind of
definite action, and the debate should be carried
to a division, so that the country will possess a list
of names for and against.
Premier See, in answer to a question the
other night, assured N.S.W. Assembly that legis-
lation in regard to life assurance companies would
be considered by the Government when returns
now being collected were received from the State
statistician. Which, from John See, simply means
nothing. Mr. See is prepared to consider, or is
considering, a score of useful reforms, but never
does anything to advance one of them. His Par-
liament is a cat-prowl which does little but con-
sider motions for adjournment and swop perso-
nalities.
The Melbourne daily papers are wailing,
oh, so bitterly, because the Labor organisation is
exacting a pledge from its candidates in the
coming Federal elections. They have pointed out
in the deepest sorrow and humiliation how shock-
ing it is to send a man into Parliament bound by
a pledge, and ask what is to become of our noble
political institutions if such a thing is permitted ?
Yet it is just 12 months since the same writers
were proving what a noble thing it was to send
men into Parliament pledged to the Kyabram
programme.
One prominent defect of Yic. Factories
Bill is the absence of any provision dealing with
the employment of Chinese in the furniture trade.
Labor-Minister Murray told a deputation of
manufacturers, who asked that the Bill should
provide for the regulation of Chinese labor and
the stamping of Chinese-made articles, that he had
tried to have such a proviso inserted, but was
blocked by his colleagues.
The Australian Parliament has decided to
select the Federal capital site by open voting.
The proposal for a secret ballot, as originally in
the resolutions, is credited to Lyne (everything
objectionable gets round to Lyne’s door somehow).
Lyne has two possible sites in his electorate, and
he naturally wouldn’t want Albury to know if his
coterie voted for Tumut, or Tumut to know if the
same crowd voted for Albury.
The Victorian Government is earning
additional obloquy by its tardiness in paying the
compensation due to retired railway employees.
Compensation comprises nine months’ pay, which
is specially appropriated, and can, therefore, be
paid without a Parliamentary vote. Many of the
men have been out of the service for months and
are suffering real hardship while unable to collect
the money due to them by a mean Government.
Bent has just introduced into the Vic-
torian Assembly a bill to compel cow and pig
keepers to provide properly paved sheds, cow-
yards, or styes for their animals. But the Kyabram
cow-keeper is not to be interfered with too much.
The Bill only applies to cities, towns, and
boroughs, or to shires that ask for it. Shires that
feel so inclined can remain as filthy as before, and
the Kyabram class has a great weakness for being
filthy.
In Victoria the mad rush for land still
continues. For 105 blocks on the Lake Buloke
common over 4500 applications were received. A
few inferior blocks in Ararat drew 310 applica-
tions. Present land boards recall the land-lottery
days of Colao and Camperdown, when the best
land in the State was swindled away. The odds
against getting a block are so great that Tatter-
sail’s sweep is a better investment wherein to
sink £l.
George Reid has still all his old dishonest
notions of finance. During the financial debate
last week he said—
The House, in’a fit of virtue, said : “We will have no
public works constructed out of loan money. They must
come out of revenue.” That is an absolutely unsound
and ridiculous position. It is a cruelly wrong attitude to
take.
The cruel wrong of not leaving quite all the bill to
our children always rouses the borrowing patriot
to fury.
George Reid’s party seems anxious to lose
him. It is proposed, now that ex-Premier Barton
has taken a judicial position, Reid should transfer
his electoral challenge to Lyne, and contest the
Hume seat. The party’s desire that Reid should
abandon his comparatively safe billet, and go
where he has a fair chance to be licked, may yet
lead it to suggest that he should fight George
Turner at St. Kilda or pursue Kingston to his
lair at Adelaide.
If Federal Chief Justice Griffith gets a
pension for his services in Queensland this
is what will happen : Supposing he decides in
favour of Queensland in any case between that
State and the Commonwealth it will be said that
he did it for fear of having his pension stopped.
Supposing he decides against Queensland it will
be said that he did it for fear he should be
suspected of being influenced by the pension
question if he didn’t. This world is full of base
suspicions.
N.S.W. Opposition leader Carrutliers in a
Sydney Telegraph interview on the Federal
Cabinet changes:
An interesting point crops up in this connection,
whether the other Ministers, who still hold office, will
resign, and go up for re-election. If so, Mr. Lyne will be
sure to be opposed.
Evidently Joseph is not sufficiently familiar with
the Federal Constitution to know that it is not
necessary, even for the new Ministers, to go up
for re-election.
A protest has been made in N.S.W.
Assembly against the further desecration of
Sydney harbor by the erection of a naval gaol on
Garden Island, and Premier See promises to make
representations to the naval authorities on the
subject. The matter might engage, too, the
attention of the Commonwealth Government,
which has been very kind to the Admiralty lately,
and might claim as some sort of a return that
Sydney be spared this indignity.
A neat backhander for Joseph Carruthers,
who complains of Premier See treacherously de-
laying for two years his hustings’ promise to deal
with reduction of members. B. R. Wise speaks :
Those who criticise the delay forget that in 1896 Mr.
Reid, with whom Mr. Carruthers was then associated,
dissolved Parliament on what he and his newspaper sup-
porters declared to be the simple issue of Upper House
reform. During the three years that Mr. Reid remained
in power not a single step beyond the printing of the Bill
was ever taken in this direction.
Ex-Premier Barton gave a striking proof
of honesty in the matter of the High Court
appointments. In a rash moment he said he had
no intention whatever of taking the Chief Justice-
ship. He was probably very sorry afterwards,
but he stuck to his word and didn’t Yes-No. He
gave the coveted position to Griffith, who had far
fewer claims upon it, and, for the sake of his
promise, only appointed himself to a subordinate
judgeship under Griffith. It is difficult to re-
member another such case in Australian politics.
Westralia is slowly realising what a fool
it made of itself when it adopted the land-grant
railway system. Already it is finding that, as a
result of that system, it will soon have to buy
land for the purposes of close settlement, and now
it is actually subsidising a steam service between
Fremantle and Geraldton, in order to compel the
Midland Railway Co. to moderate its demands.
It gave land and rights away wholesale, and so
created one huge monopolist; and now it has to
pay another company to break that monopoly
down.
Apropos the proposal to
spend £20,000 of loan money on
a gaol at Bega. N.S.W. has a
gaol at Glen Times which cost
£20,000, and has never con-
tained a prisoner; an empty
gaol at Trial Bay ; another at
Silverton ; a new penitentiary
capable of containing several
hundred prisoners is being
built at Long Bay; and, with
a decreasing gaol population,
there are unoccupied cells con-
tinually in every gaol and lock-up in
the State. Industrial prison at Trial Bay
having been closed, it would be interesting to
learn something about the experiment started in
Maoriland last year to occupy the manageable
prisoners at re-forestation —a work sadly neg-
lected in Australia.
Says a Sydney paper :
Mr. Kingston’s huge political personality drifting about
the House is a constant source of danger.
Some night there will probably be a bump as the
natural consequence, and Turner will. come
hurriedly on deck, with his surplus in his hand, to
report that the vessel is filling rapidly, and Deakin
will speak eloquently over the side for four hours
to the object of collision, and urge that there
should be no personal ill-feeling.
Dr. Maloney recently brought forward in
Victorian Assembly his seventh Women’s Fran-
chise Bill. Premier Irvine said he had no hope of
getting a statutory majority, as the Upper House
had cast woman’s franchise out of the Constitution
Reform Bill, and no fresh legislation on the
subject would be possible until that Bill had
received the royal assent. The want of that
royal assent is going to be a handy peg to hang
many things on.
Premier John See (John the Considerer)
has promised to consider the demand that the
trading coupon shall be abolished in N.S.W: by
Act of Parliament. Victoria, Maoriland and
Tasmania have wiped out the parasite ; a Coupon
Abolition Bill passed S.A. Assembly but.was lost
in Jenkins’ Upper House by one vote ; and
Queensland has a Bill before Parliament. And
John See is going to “consider ” the matter. It
is difficult to remember what John isn’t consider-
ing just now.
In a Riverina town lives a Frenchman
aged about 80. He was naturalised in Victoria 40
years ago, and has lived nearly 30 years in N.S.W.
No one ever explained to him that he had to be
naturalised six times to become a full-blown
Briton throughout the Commonwealth, and
N.S.W. accepted him as a citizen and a voter
without any;question. But when he applied for
the old age pension N.S.W. repudiated him as an
alien. It was quite legal—but when is that
Commonwealth Old Age Pension coming along ?
The Bulletin receives a circular, the
work of one Lindon Biddulph, in which L.B.
seeks to point out that the only possible place for
a Federal capital is at Lyndhurst, on the N.S.W.
western line, and presumably somewhere about
Mr. Biddulph’s back door. The most interesting
item, however, is a footnote which begins thus :
N.B. —I have not considered Alburv or Bombala, as
these places are situated on or near the Victorian
The off-hand way in which a certain arrogant,
parish-pump party in N.S.W. assumes that every-
thing Victorian must necessarily be infected, and
that for a place to be even adjacent to Victoria
disqualifies it as a possible capital, is calculated to
promote a whole lot of good feeling.
The pestiferous, cadging farmer again.
The blessed Koroit (Vic.) Waterworks
Trust,, which in 1899 had £2047 of its
£5047 liabilities and .£127 of its £227
accrued interest wiped off the slate,
coolly asked Water Supply Minister
Cameron for‘the loan of £BOO the other
day, as its machinery, bought with money
borrowed' from the State and never repaid, was
worn out and it wanted to buy more. And,
instead of kicking these impudent beggars
downstairs, Cameron promised to consider
the request—that is to say, he would see
his boss, Irvine. Isn’t there one single
gang of farmers in the whole State
honest enough to pay interest on the /
very trifling amount debited to
themfor their waterworks and also
to make provision for wear and tear
of machinery ?
It is getting on for ten years
since Private Enterprise applied
for, and was granted, the right
to build the Tasmanian Great Western Railway,
and the line hasn’t yet been commenced. The
people who got the concession never seriously
attempted to build a line; their whole visible
purpose was to sell the “concession” at an
enormous price to some rich but unfortunate fools
and retire with the profits. The “concession”
has been renewed again and again, and it has been
hawked round England for years in a vain search
for the right kind of fool, and is now being
hawked round America for the_ same purpose—
and even yet Tasmania hasn’t quite raised the
courage to give Private Enterprise definite notice
to quit, and end the whole disreputable business.
The King has, so far, refused assent to
the Victorian Constitution Reform Bill, on the
ground that cool, calm Equity lawyer Irvine
didn’t know enough law, or didn’t' take enough
trouble about his law, to see that the measure was
passed by the statutory majority required to
amend the Constitution. The publication in
England of Irvine’s crazy and utterly illegal
Strike Suppression Bill probably made the British
authorities keep a specially keen eye on his law.
The position is a bitter commentary on the Cool,
Calm One’s incompetence. All the results of his
negotiations with the House of Landlords have
gone to pieces, unless the messages he has sent to
England, praying that the measure may be allowed
to go through after all, should soften the heart of
Balfour, and make him decide not to tread too
hard on the crushed worm.
THEIR BUSY DAY.
Melbourne Age recently complained that there-
was a blank in the weather telegrams from Satur-
day till Tuesday. The above represents the sort of
weather that is hanging round to take us unawares
on Sunday night.
The refusal of the Senate to hold a joint,
sitting with the House of Representatives for the
purpose of selecting a Federal capital is under-
standable enough. The Senate, by itself, repre-
sents half, the legislative power, but if the two-
Houses sit and vote together it represents less
than one-third—36 votes out of 111. There are
certain circumstances under which a joint sitting
is ordered by law, but a voluntary joint sitting is
quite another thing. The Australian Govern
ment should have selected its own site and intro-
duced a Bill. Failing that it should have pro-
posed a ballot in each House, to see if, by any
luck, the two Houses selected the same site, and l
tried the joint sitting afterwards if necessary.
New South .Wales can’t complain of its
share of Federal honors and profits. Until now
it has had three representatives in the Australian
Ministry—on a population basis more than have-
been allotted to either Queensland or Victoria. It
has supplied the Federal Premier, the leader and
deputy-leader of the Opposition; it gets the-
Federal capital, and it annexes two out of the-
v three High Court Judgeships. Also the position
of Minister of Customs was raised from the fourth
in order to the second, so that N.S.W.’s Bill Lyne-
' might rank ahead of Victoria’s George Turner.
Arid even then S.M. Herald came opt with an
article setting forth that N.S.W' vould be-
grievously wronged unless the second Australian-
Premier came from that State as woll as the first.
WHY SOME MEN
GO TO CHURCH.
“ Wot , don’t Billy
yo jishin’ a Sun-
dye no more?”
“ Not fer a while
he lent the par-
son a quid, an’ has to take it out in pew rent."
At last the N.S.W. Government makes a
feeble move towards the long-promised referendum'
re the reduction of the size of Parliament. It is
proposed to give the public a chance to vote for
an Assembly of 125 members, as at present, or
100, or 90, or 80. The person who wants a House
of 60 or 70 members is to be muzzled. The person
who wants to reduce the numerous State politician
by abolishing the Upper House is to be gagged.
And a referendum which takes no account of the
Upper House—which only allows the people to
vote, within certain limits, for the reduction of
the House which tries to do something, and gives
them no opportunity to vote for the reduction of
the House which doesn’t even try to do anything
—is a pretence and a mockery.

Nowadays every man who is good enough
to command a decent billet elsewhere is getting
out of the Victorian Public Service. Recently a
man with about half-a-dozen high-class diplomas
in chemistry and mineralogy left for a well-paid
post in Africa. A surprised Government, trying
to find out why he left, discovered that it had
absent-mindedly cut down his pay to £1 a week.
It is an evidence of the great tiredness of
Christians when a person by the name of
Nathaniel Levi, M.L.C. has to introduce a Bill
into the "Victorian Legislative Council to prevent
Sunday trading in hotels. If Levi is not a Jew
he ought to issue a writ for libel against
his nose. Levi’s Bill makes it a crime for anyone
not a bona fide traveller to purchase liquor on the
Christian’s Sunday or during hours prohibited by
the principal Licensing Act. Further, it makes
it a crime to be found carrying liquor on a Sunday
or during prohibited hours. Tin's, it would seem,
might press heavily on persons going home “with
a skin full ” by the last trains. In addition any
person requesting a child under 15 years to obtain
or carry liquor from any licensed premises on
Sunday will be liable to a fine not exceeding £5.
Levi’s enemies say that these provisions are catch-
vote-concerns and that Levi is really after power
to transfer a license from one house to another.
At any rate his Bill makes elaborate provision
for removal of licenses—a thing which a holy
Government practically suppressed some dozen
years ago.

On September 12th a few Tasmanians
remembered that it was 100 years since Boweni
commenced his abortive attempt of settlement ati
Risdon, the cramped little place with no back to;'
it. Also the daily papers, including the Hobart,
Mercury, brought out centenary numbers, care-
fully expurgated of undue references to “the
System.” As the System was almost the only;
live or vigorous item of news 100 years ago, there ;
was mighty little to write about when it was left j
out. A really good centenary number, with all
the ancient flogging in it, would have been the
most completely alive publication Tasmania has
seen for a long while. In February next, 100
years after the founding of Hobart by Governor
Collins, the threatened centennial celebrations
will be held. There will be a religious service
and some children’s buns and lemonade. Also,
John Norton hopes to deliver a political address
in Hobart about that time.

Bunkum caused to be shot in the early part of the

J. H. Carruthers, at Waverley (Sydney)
-bowling carnival, the other day,- let off. a. Wrtfc-
brous joke to , the effect that while :on a visit
to Japan, President John Young had pro-
posed to bring a team of Jap bowlers to Aus-
tralia, but, owing to Federal legislation regarding
aliens, the project had to be dropped. Which is
either the usual anti-White-Australia lie or else
evidence that Carruthers is a. crassly ignorant
politician. Federal immigration laws wouldn’t
have prevented any such Japs coming, provided
they didn’t intend to settle here. The Common-
wealth law expressly provides for such cases.

Referring to the credit of the State, Premier See said
that New South Wales would always meet its obligations

What beautiful bumptiousness! How does
Premier See know ? There is one occasion a little
way ahead when N.S.W. is pledged to repay
nearly £8,000,000 of debt in one lump. It will
meet that obligation if some one will lend it the
money ; if the loan is refused it will be bankrupt
unless its financial system reforms very much in
the interim. And there are a dozen similar
occasions ahead.

“ Bluecap ” writes :
The Minister for Education in the Vic. Crooked-Irvine
Ministry inquires into all cases of leave, and always
deducts pay. An outbreak of diphtheria occurred at one
school. School would have been shut and teacher would
have got full pay—but he was fool enough to catch the
disease from some youngster, and therefore lost his pay.
The following takes the cake : The Fijian authorities
vote £50 each year for a Victorian inspector to come
over and examine the schools. An inspector does this
on his holidays, and they take it turn about. This
year, one was sent as usual, and a Minister inquired into
the bill, which is paid through Vic. Education Depart-
ment, and refunded from Fiji. When asked to pass it, he
at first refused, but, after pressure, signed for £23, pass-
age-money. Balance was annexed by the Vic. revenue.
If the inspector prosecutes, he will be sure to be sacked,
go he must allow the Irvine Ministry to rob him of £27.
A Tasmanian politician tells this story : —
I had a motion on the paper which I considered of the
greatest importance, and by sounding my fellow members
I had come to the conclusion it would just squeeze
through. At the division old Winchester came over to
my side ; then he gave a sudden ejaculation, and went
back to his seat, and I was beaten by one vote. The old
man had promised me his vote, too, and I asked him
angrily why he left me. “My boy," he said, “ I’m very
sorry, but I’d left my spectacles on my seat, and Smith
was just going to sit on them. I ran to save them, and I
didn’t like to take them and come back again, lest Smith
should think I suspected him of an intention to steal
them." So the country was lost (for my motion would
have saved it, of course) all on account of old Winchester’s
spectacles. I’d rather have bought him an astronomical
telescope than have had that happen.

Perfect Health
Is within the reach of almost every woman. The
weakness, nervousness and irritability from which
so many women suffer is in general due to disease
of the delicate womanly organism. When tlie
disease is cured the general health is re-established.
Mrs. E. Chapman, 24 Princess-street, Sydney,
tells how Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills saved her
from a life of misery, and restored her to health
and happiness. She writes
“ Some years ago I suffered from headache
and biliousness, which finally ended in liver com-
plaint, so the doctors told me. I underwent
treatment from various ones, but no relief could I
find ; my back got considerably worse, and finally
I had to give up work. At the same time I was
badly affected with the various ailments that
women are subject to. I really began to give up
all hope, and felt that life was not worth living;
but relief came when I was persuaded to take a
course of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills; from
that hour I have never been without them. I can
say without fear that they completely cured me,
for I am now able to work without trouble,
regular in habits, and I can confidently recommend
them to all women similarly troubled, and I know
there are hundreds. lam only too glad to be able
to give this testimony. I may also state that my
husband has derived great benefit from taking the
pills. ”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills make weak
women strong, sick women well. They promote
regularity, dry disagreeable and enfeebling drains,
heal inflammation, and cure female weakness.
When these diseases are cured, headache, back-
ache and nervous weakness are cured also.

S.M. Herald threatens to wrest the Yes-No
championship from George Reid. Granny’s account of
the A.J.C, Derby Day filled a whole page, and for three
following days the old lady spread herself over two
columns of description of fashion, beauty and racing. At
the.end of the meeting the same old lady fired off a lead-
ing article on the “ Evils of Gambling," using as a text a
Christian Endeavorer’s remark that the Randwick meeting
was a gathering of all the scoundrels of the Common-
wealth- The fact that it had done its best to boom the
said meeting of scoundrels was carefully ignored.
On the rise overlooking the Randwick course,
where. the local council allows the unregistered
“ bookie ” to lay odds of two to one in thrUmmers, a full-
blooded Chinaman has started shouting the odds in
“ welly good ” style on his own behalf.

Some queer doings were disclosed at an inquiry
held by the M.L. Trotting Association into the general
conduct of the Auckland T.C., one of the foremost clubs
in the State. As a result, a Hotspur note was forwarded
to the. club suggesting reconstruction, the payment of
outstanding debts, that the secretary shouldn’t have any
connection with the tote, that men who were in the for-
feit-list shouldn’t be allowed to act as stewards, and that
the handicapper should be distinct from the starter.
Otherwise, the club’s programmes won’t be passed in
future.

A big M.L. Mo t’other day laid a local pressman
£lOOO to a cigarette against chances of Benzoni in
principal event of Riccarton November meeting. It will
be something of a joke if the scribe has to collect, and his
prospects are by no means bad, for the nag is still alive
and shaping well. This recalls a happening in Sydney
some years back. A group at Tatts. Club was talking
trebles and one of the party named three of late Hon
Jas. White’s horses as possibilities. “Rot," remarked a
bystanding book, “ to show you fellows you can’t pick
. trebles I’ll lay a thousand to a bottle of wine against the
' trio named and we’ll,, have the wine now.” A thriving
’ Sydney auctioneer of the present time accepted the bet

N.S.W. Parliamentary Gambling Committee
heard some straight talk from one-time punter, Mr.
Justin M’Sweeney. J. M‘S. was a big railway contractor
once, and now deals in timber. With a few paltry
thousands lying idle, he embarked upon racehorse-owning
.as a means of enjoyment and possible profit. The whole
lot of his seven o/ eight nags showed on the track that it
was in them to annex a Melbourne Cup, but somehow
each time they were “ after it ” the strong-armed jockey
or the doper or something got to work. Once he
backed his Arihi for £5OOO to win Maribyrnong
Stakes, and the “ good thing ” duly came off, but
subsequently his cake in every instance went to
dough. Between ’92 and ’97 he says he lost £30,000.
Mr. M‘Sweeney’s sizing-up of I. Moses’tribe isn’t flattering.
“They will hire people to kill a horse if every other
means of stiffening fails. They have been known to hire
jockeys to throw a horse, and they will do one of those
things to Mr. Crick if he has any chance of winning the
Cup with Ossian. They’ll never let him win £40,000 —he
hasn’t a hope.” Mr. M‘Sweeney said a great deal more,
most of which is useful reading for young men with turf
proclivities. ~

Maoriland always- did take itself verra seriously.
Nowadays it can hardly get its hat on. Lyttelton Times
of September 11 : “ Have we not just celebrated the
return to our shores of a football team which made our
Australian cousins seriously consider whether they were
made of exactly the same material as the Maorilanders ?
Do we not intend to officially welcome back to-night the
Arnsts, who from the extreme scratch mark disposed of
all the Australian champions in the greatest cycle road
race of the year ? Did not even our billiard representative
appropriate the’biggest billiard handicap that Australia
has ever promoted ? With Cruciform’s victory rounding
off this cycle of sporting successes it really does look as if
■in the colonial sporting world ‘ we are the people.’"

Again it is on the cards that the crack three-
year-old of Scobie’s stable may win the Derby and Cup
double. Emir, at time of writing, is apparently cured of
his leg trouble, and looks all the better in health for
his respite from hard work. A great colt, unless the
-trainer has made an almost impossible mistake in his
-estimate.
• • • •
Abundance, on his three-year-old record, is
-uncommonly well handicapped for the Melbourne Cup at
9.4. His score last season was five wins, including the
A.J.C. and V.R.C. Derbies ; four seconds, one third (Mel-
bourne Cup), and only two “nowheres,” one of these
being a meritorious failure in the Australian Oup race,
when the animal was off color, and the course was rain-
soddened. With another lOlbs. on his weight Abundance
would seem to have a Cup chance.

The Victory and Vanity Fair, winner and
runner-up in last Melbourne Cup race, will not see the
post this year. The mare seems to have knocked herself
out by a mad bolting gallop she perpetrated on the track
a while ago, and The Victory is suffering from a bad
tendon, or something. The burly little horse was ex-
pected to improve rapidly with hard work, but his pace
has gone, for the present, if not for ever.

Must not be forgotten by backers of the “ two
Belahs ” for Melbourne Derby and Cup that same man
(“ Mr J. East") owns Scottish King, though latter is
trained in Melbourne and former in Sydney. S.K. is
among the 6.7 section in both races and seems to have
more than an outside chance of winning.

The owners of the Maoriland flier, Achilles,
have sufficient belief in their nag to run the colt
against either the local Cruciform or Ibex, or both
together, in a sweepstake of 500 sovs. each. Wellington
(M.L.) Racing Club promptly offered to arrange the
event, and add an additional 600 sovs. and a 100-guinea
cup to the sweepstakes. If the event comes off, punters
are likely to be treated to the unique spectacle of every
horse in the event going as if Sheol would swallow him
unless he comes in first. It’s a satisfaction to even drop
cash on a race like that.
• * , * *
Significant facts about Nothos : 1250g5. was
refused for him. A big commission was invested at card-
call before last Metrop., and a load of coin placed early on
the day of the race. His showing was decidedly good,
and he humps 61b. less in the Caulfield than in the
Metrop. If he doesn’t score in the Caulfield, his prospects
in the Melbourne Cup are not too blue ; he’s quite able to
see the journey out.
* * * *
Said that but for recently placed false rail at
Randwick, Marvel Loch would have made a new record
for the Metrop., his 2.35 for l£m. equalled the best
previously done. But had T.M.S. run up to track gallop
of 2.32 he would probably have won. Also looks as if
Ibex would have established fresh ljm. figures but for
innovation referred to, as his 2.7 J was only Jsec. worse
than prior best. False rail runs out 12ft. in some places,
and is situated ’tween 5 and 6fur. posts, which means that
events set going at last mentioned point are something
in excess of nominal distance. More than possible Marvel
Loc h may annex Caulfield Cup ; most of Lochiel’s improve
witn age, and Scully’s squibby-looking little mare is yet
only four years old.

Despite two record gatherings, A.J.C. com-
mittee reports a loss of £3OO on recent meet, and yet
results are better than ever before for Spring. Same
period last year saw £10,700 added, and shortage £360.
This time added amount was £ll,OOO, with £l5O more for
salaries. Wet weather on closing day did the damage.

Regrettable that Orzil-Kettledrum colt, Kilfera,
has not so far figured, and will not shape in any spring
turf events, and might not be seen out till autumn,
through kidney trouble. Presence of Kilfera in various
big things would have rendered them heaps more interest-
ing owing to the fact that he squelched Emir, Cherson,
Duke of Grafton and co., when gathering A.J.C. Cham-
pagne Stakes’ laurels.

Fame ? From a Tweed River exchange :
“ The three-year-old gelding, Dill Maeky, is now being
hacked about the local streets. The Cardinal is enjoying
a spell in luxuriant paddocks. They will probably meet
again at the T.R. J. Club meeting on Boxing Day.
Compare performances of Australian and Maori-
land champion mares—Wakeful and Cruciform. Wakeful’s
first race was at four years. In 38 starts she won 22 races,
was second in 11, and third in three. Prize money accu-
mulated, £14,700. Cruciform commenced operations at
two years, and started nine times. Next year she made
14 starts, last season four, and present year two. Her
record is 18 firsts, nine seconds and one third in 29
attempts ; and money gathered tots up £6OOO. Wakeful
was bought by present owner for 310 guineas. Mr. Stead
paid 325 guineas for Cruciform.

Punters will be wondering whether “ Marmont ”
M’Arthur’s luck hasn’t turned again. Last Friday after-
noon two of his horses —Verne and Le Portel —collide)!
while at exercise on the track, and both of them were
killed. An abrupt termination to the owner’s recent ruiji
of good fortune, Verne, the 6-year-old sister to Bobadil
and Billali, had won a couple of races within the past few
weeks, and nromised to be a valuable brood mare anon. I
* • • •
Manner in which Billali is talked makes it
appear that Caulfield Cup is over, bar shouting, but
many good judges (among them V.A.T.O. handicapper)
aren’t taking as much stock in the nag’s Memsie Stakes
showing as the majority of people, and assert that, being
in front, with the game absolutely his own, is to him quite
a different thing from fighting it out in a good field.
Billali is his brother Bobadil’s double.

’Taint sport now. Th’ sport’s killed ! Up at Bung Bung
it was sport. Every horse, from a draught to a three-
months’ foal, would take part in the races, and the best

* Take ’im out o’ the crowd and get ’im some fresh hair

I fanned the man with me ’at and arsked four others to
take im out, but they all sez ‘ Take’m yerself.’ So I did,
and they promised to keep me place. But there’s no
’onor in bettin’ men. Next time I take a man, or a
woman either, what ’as fainted out of a crowd, I’ll be

women, whispered the profane word in my ear.

“ A Man on the Course,” writing in Sydney
D. Telegraph (27/8/’O3) re totalisator, says : “ Actually,
the bookmaker flourishes in its company,” and, of all
places in the world, cites Maoriland as an instance. The
cold facts are, that when the totalisator was first insti-
tuted in that State the bookmakers found they could not
make a living, and an almost general exodus ensued.
The few who remained had to lay totalisator odds, and
did not consider the results satisfactory. Most of the
howling brotherhood came to Australia, and are here
still. Some few may have gone back, but not many. The
writer states that, for some time back, odds have been
laid on the New Zealand Cup, which is not run till
November. Of course, “ long-shots ” will be laid by
bookmakers, in betting clubs or elsewhere, but the booky
is a thin crop in Maoriland now all the same.

was won by one horse, champion Ribbonwood. If the
private match with' Fritz is included, however, another
£llOO must be added to his total, and places owner and
horse at the head of both winning lists. Otherwise
Buckland’s St. Simon tops the crowd with £431.

At recent Coolgardie and Boulder meetings the
ramping and roping would have staggered the strongest
“joint” from the pony courses. Total of disqualifica-
tions—one horse and party for one month Boulder
stewards took a race away from Perplex for alleged inter-
ference with second horse (Allander), and disqualified
Mat Harris for 12 months without hearing further
evidence than that of the protesting jockey, Trewartha
The W.A.T.C., on appeal, promptly removed Harris’ dis-
qualification, and suspended Trewartha for three months
for improper conduct. Allander is a Boulder horse, and
some Boulder “ big bugs” backed him for a stake in this
E articular race. These individuals come out all right, for
oth books and tote paid backers of Allander, on the
decision of the local stewards. Perplex gets the stake,
of course, but there is no hard-and-fast rule in Westralia
about bets following the stakes.

The walking craze has gripped Maoriland with
the tenacity of an octopus. On Thursday afternoons
spider-legged drapers’ assistants pit themselves against
bacon-vendors and the like. Arrayed in bathing costumes
and blushes, they expose their hairy legs to the populace.
“ The Walk ” (which is the only name yet applied to the
insanity) always starts in the centre of the town, proceeds
—with its attendant crowd—along the principal thorough-
fares, and finishes ditto. When finishing the competitors
invariably swing their arms madly and roll their eyes in
the most horrible manner, what time the crowd waves its
umbrella and yells. Even Capital has been seized by the
mania. The Fat Men of one street challenge those of
another, and the press raves over “ the promotion of the
element of sport.” In the race most of the competitors
fall down near the first pub It is a pathetic sight to see
a fat man prostrate on the roadside from palpitation of
the heart, through hurrying at three miles ah hour.

“C.P.”: Had the job of “doing” some golf
championships recently. Didn’t know the game from a
bar of soap, and now that I do know something about it,
would certainly give the cake to the soap. The sturdy
athletes of both sexes who competed, as a rule resembled
nothing more than a consumptive sanatorium out for a
walk, though occasionally one ran to flesh —which was
about the only violent exercise he ever could have taken.
Not one seemed to strike the happy medium. Every one
of the male golfers assumed a Norfolk suit with a sweater
and plaid stockings, while the ladies wore curtailed
skirts, exposing also plaid hosiery. The less the
hosiery contained the shorter the skirt. The sweater
also prevailed. The principle of the game is somewhat
intricate—so say the people who play it. The competitor
places the ball on top of a miniature Himalaya, then
calls his boy, who is carrying a bag containing several
thousand sticks, says “Eena-deena-dina-do,” &c., &c., as
we all used to when small boys, and selects his
club. Removes his coat, swings the stick some
dozen times, then lets drive and knocks the ball
25 miles—or inches; that is if he’s a good player.
If he isn’t he hits the air or knocks down his
Himalaya. Having administered a severe blow to the inno-
cent ball, the expert hands the club back to the boy,
resumes his coat, and starts out on his arduous journey
to where the ball ought to be. But it isn’t. Looks two
hours for the ball. This seems to be the principal science
of the game. When the boy has discovered it first try,
the player again removes his coat, selects another club
by the same formula, gives the ball another swipe, and
repeats the former performance until he has gone right
round the earth and returned to the spot at which he
originally started. Golf undoubtedly proves that the
earth is round. The one who gets home with fewest
swipes is applauded and carried to the refreshment booth,
where he makes a speech and is afterwards presented
with a putty medal. Bowls is a better game than golf,
as you don’t have to wait so long ’tween drinks. I got
hold of a chap who used to say “haw ! ” and he told me
all about “ bogeys” and a chap having to “ lay a long put
on a keen green dead,” and another fellow being “ dead
square ” or “ halving the hole,” so I got on all right, and
worked up a good column. I’ve seen fights and football
matches —which perhaps are the same thing—but for real
excitement commend me to a golf championship.

Kurupo Tareha, who won the amateur golf
championship of M.L., t’other day, to the unfeigned
delight of Maoridom, is a fine, robust specimen of colored
humanity, stands 6ft. in his socks, and wears a smile one-
third of his own length. Tareha is a native of Hawkes
Bay, and comes from the bluest of blue-blooded
stock. His father, Te Moanawanui (Henare Tomoana),
at one time sat in the House of Representatives.
Tareha formed one of the Maori contingent that
went to England at Jubilee time and shook a great
deal of ground performing hakas for the glorification of
Seddon and the edification of the nobility. Nickolaus,
the runner-up in the tournament, has a glowing future
before him at the game of two up and one to play. When
other kiddies were playing marbles he used to bunker the
domestic cat in St. Andrews (Scotland), and his records
show that he won a match at the age of six. He is now 19.

The Victorian football season, just closed, is
probably the most brilliant since the old days, when
there were men with gigantic feet in the land and the
personal friend of Peter Burns or Billy Hannysee
possessed the freedom of the city. But one thing which
would lead to better football would be the captaining of
the team by a non-player. As what sort of incompetent
would the military world class Roberts or De Wet had
they conducted their campaign from a place in the front
rank, where they fired a rifle all day? Yet the football
captain is supposed to bear the heat and burden of the
combat and at the same time possess the cool,
hard head of the tactician. Under the captaincy of
Alec Dick, often said to be the best general that ever
managed a team, Essendon held either first or second
position for a long series of seasons. When Dick retired
from active play nobody thought of suggesting that he
should continue his captaincy as a spectator, keeping in
touch with his men by strolling casually about the ground
outside the boundary posts. Had they done so, Essendon
might be premier to-day instead of tailing in towards the
end of the list.
• • • •
It’s wise to have your life insured before taking
to football in Melbourne these times. Three matches on
the last day of the season resolved themselves into riots,
in which barrackers and players cracked one another’s
skulls like a 12th of July picnic party. In one case the
barracker-in-chief ordered his followers to “ Go for the
pickets ” 1 They accordingly stripped a neighboring
fence, and proceeded to “deal it out” with vigor. In
the struggle several heads were broken, and one player
was maimed for life. The battle-cry of these gentle lambs
was “kill the blankers.” The game as now played
is nothing but legalised assault and battery and premedi-
tated murder; athletes of the better class are giving it
up. The abolition of football by Act of Parliament may
yet have to be seriouslv considered. .
Immediately old man Duncan reached Dunedin
he burst up the “ happy family” fiction of the M.L. team
in Australia. Kiernan, he said, was no class ; Stead had
been unfairly treated, and North Islanders were grossly
favored in the selection of teams. In one act Duncan
became the most talked-of and most cursed man in all
Seddonland. The Aucklanders were particularly sore,
and when the Auckland crowd reached Otago they cut
their.ex-captain dead, apd promised Otago the premier
walloping of football history! One paper delicately
hinted that it would be wise of Duncan to sprain his toe
before the match. Duncan ignored the hint, but refused
to enter the Auckland dressing-room to toss up with
their captain, and sent one of his team instead. He sur-
vived the match, but sore at heart, for Auckland, after
being beaten by Taranaki, Wellington, and Southland,
got home on Otago by 11 points to nil.
* * * *
All things considered, Warner’s team will be
about as representative an All England Eleven as could
be picked, and if it is badly beaten in the five-games test
the result will only prove that among the multitude of
England’s front-rank cricketers there is little excellence
and a lot of inconsistency in form.

S.A. Cricket Association, with a fall of over 100
in its membership (now 679), has nevertheless reduced its
debt from £3600 to £1761 in three years. The loss on
inter-State matches last season was £l5, and the English
team played for a suburban association, the Oval being
let in advance fora cycling meeting. S.A. now exchanges
with Victoria one-third of the gross takings in matches,
paying £57 and receiving £226 last year. N.S.W simply
recoups any loss sustained through playing in Sydney
(after deducting profit made in Adelaide), and its subsidy
on this account came to £96. The S.A.C.A wants to
spend £4OOO on an improved members’ stand, but can’t
see its way to do so yet. It claims that the Oval bicycle
track is “ the finest in Australia.”
Eternal squabble between Sydney Cricket
Ground Trust and N.S.W. Cricket Association will yet end
in a free fight. S.C.G. people want to scoop 6d. from
every grandstand fee in connection with English matches
(which works out 27 per cent, of the whole), Associatijn
to pay out of the balance all ground exes., &c. In ancient
Sydney, Albert Cricket Ground Co.’s attitude forced
setting apart of present ground, and now the Cricket
Association talks of trying to secure a site of its own.

Finish of the Victorian 10 miles cross-country
championship saw what was probably the muddiest lot in
all Australia —their muddiness only being surpassed by
the misery of the shivering spectators —chasing J.
Stilwell (Essendon), the nearest to him at the business end
of the journey being Ferguson of East Melbourne. Stilwell,
in winning has placed a new record on the roster, this
being his third successive victory. Herbert, of Ballarat,
holder of record time (59min. ssec.), has also three
wins to his credit, but they were not secured jn
consecutive years. Winner’s time this year (60.37),
despite the fact that conditions favored stamina
rather than speed, is an improvement on both his previous
successes. The club championship also goes to Essendon,
which is this year suffering from a plethora of pennants,
it being the proud proprietor of the Cricket, Lacrosse,
and Harrier Championships. A feature of this year’s
meet was the presence of a team from “Tassy.” The
dozen from that brief island all completed the course—a
result achieved by no other competing team.

Likely there’ll be no match for Australian
heavyweight bruising supremacy for some time to come.
Champion M’Coll’s shoulder, wrenched in fight with
Scanlan, three months ago, isn’t nearly right yet, and
doesn’t even show signs of mending.. Hard luck for
M'Coll, who has a rich harvest in Creedon, Felix and
James waiting for him.
• * * *
That Felix scrap should be Scanlan’s last fight
in Australia. No boxing club can afford to have a hot-
tempered person of such toothy tendencies about the
premises ; he is too good a peg for the Obadiah press to
hang vast sermons on.
* * * *
Scanlan-Felix heavyweight fight, at Sydney
National Sporting Club, saw the white favorite at 2 to 1.
At end of first round Scanlan was 3 to 1, which was
absurd, considering form and skill displayed. Scanlan’s
chance was only visible during the first three rounds, and
then because there was a feeling that the black had no
heart, and that tfie changing situation might supply an
opportunity for the white right to flatten out the son of
Ham. It was not till the sixth round, when Scanlan’s
comparative helplessness and utter inability to make use
of any chances became evident, that Felix showed his
best form, driving home his long left with symmetry and
confidence, and thenceforward he was superb.- The
black man behaved most fairly, and, in breaking,
never once tried any “ smart” work, but Scanlan rarely
missed a chance to get one home during the break or
while holding Felix fast. For nine rounds the black’s
clever left was never off the Yankee’s face, throat or
chest. The 15th round was furious, and Scanlan forced
Felix against the ropes, and, gripping his throat with the
left, bent over him. Then the colored man hurled him
off, and rushed across to the referee and showed what
looked very like the marks of the Yankee’s teeth on his
breast, and the fight and the coin went to Felix on the
foul amid a storm of cheers and hoots. The Yankee
left on Monday for his native land, where they burn alive
the impudent negro who dares to stand up against the
white man.

If the Maoriland amateur pugs succeed in
downing this continent’s reps, after the manner of their
footballers, it will be due to brute force and crass ignor-
ance of when they are beaten. Heavyweight giant
Taylor and middleweight Griffin are sluggers pure and
simple, and the selection contests revealed nothing but
physical fitness and capacity for punishment. They don’t
box, they try to knock out.

The Fury of Justice A'Beckett.
The angry Justice A’Beckett got extra
angry at Ararat (Vio.), the other day. He
was trying a lad of 17 years of age for an alleged
attempted criminal assault on a girl of 15. The
evidence for the prosecution was that the offence
was committed by accused while three of his
mates stood guard. On the other side, the offence
was denied and it was shown that the young lady
had been guilty of previous improprieties. In
summing up to the jury Justice A’Beckett lashed
out like a wild horse and said, among other heated
remarks, that if the jury believed the girl’s evi-
dence there had been an assault of a most gross
character, and the conduct , of the ruffian who
assaulted the girl, and of the three ruffians who
looked on, was more like that of a horde of savages
than of members of a civilised community. The
jury did not believe the girl’s story, and promptly
brought in a verdict of not guilty. Then Mr.
A’Beckett lost all control of himself, and assum-
ing the alleged offence to be'proved he howled
like this :
Then I take it assaults on girls in this district are a
form of amusement not punishable by law, and that this
young man and his companions may benefit by the know-
ledge and let their desires grow riot at the expense of
girls, and that, however clear the evidence, an Ararat
jury will not convict. It is a disgrace to the community.
And, as usual, no juryman had the courage to tell
the cantankerous old man that his conduct in
bullying the jurymen for finding a verdict accord-
ing to their consciences, as they were sworn to do,
was a disgrace to the bench, and a blot upon the
judicial wig, and a smudge upon the long judicial
rags. For many years past there has been in
evidence all over Australia the evil-minded girl who
brings false charges against some man, and who,
when bowled out, cheerfully admits herself to be a
perjurer, and yet goes away unpunished. Among
dozens of such cases there hasn’t been one, so far
as the writer can recollect, in which the girl per-
jurer of this kind, even when she cheerfully
admitted herself a perjurer, has suffered in any
way from her crime. Judges and Attorneys-
.General conspire together to shield her,’ just
as if they liked that kind of crime. And just
because she knows, by reason of the shameful
fashion in which Judges and Attorneys-General
tolerate this especially foul species of per-
jury, that she can perjure herself with impunity,
this kind of girl is horribly frequent. And
because of her frequency, and because of the con-
spiracy to shield and encourage her, juries look
askance at the young woman of admittedly
dubious character who comes to the court with a
glib tale of how her pure young life was blighted.
But J udges, apparently, never grow any wiser.

sores quiekly healed. I find Zam-Buk also very
efficacious for cuts and burns, and I feel sure, when
its qualities are generally known, no family will

Mr. Chamberlain significantly asked of an
Australian in England the other day: “Now that
there is Federation and a Governor-General is it
necessary to have a Governor from England in all
the States?” ' '

SPECIALITIES
Sentenced at Perth recently to two years
for bigamy—George F. Mulqueeny, said to be
identical with Mulqueeny, a witness for the
Times before the Parnell Commission. Mul-
queeny, who was a man of many parts, told
Captain O’Shea he held proof that Parnell had
given Frank Byrne £100 to escape to America,
and the gallant captain introduced the informer
to Soames, manager of the Times. Mulqueeny, in
the box, declared that Soames gave him “£4a
week and money whenever he liked to call for it.”
He has never had such a good time since, and
when arrested in Perth was selling newspapers at
the post office.
Barton’s prolonged “think” before con-
senting to quit politics is said to have been
lubricated by draughts of milk and boiling water,
mixed in equal quantities. Nevertheless, we can
take it for granted that he would never have
arrived at any reasonable decision without the
illuminating help of D.C.L. Whisky. Most intel-
ligent decisions, whether in business or political
enterprise, or from the Bench, owe most of their
wisdom to D.C.L.—The Whusky of the Wise.*
S.M. Herald announces a death which
carries back to the very early days :
COX.—September 9, at her late residence, Flood-
street, Leichhardt, in her 71st year, Annie Mar-
garet, eldest and beloved daughter of the late John
and Sarah Cox, of St. John’s Wood, Regent’s Park,
London, grand-daughter of the late Francis Cox,
Circular Quay, Sydney, and only sister of Mr.
George Francis Cox and Mrs. M. Todhunter.
Francis Cox came out to N.S.W. about the year
1791 and set up a smithy on the shores of Sydney
Cove about the. spot where Harrison, Jones and
Devlin have their big warehouses now. In Sept.,
1806, he was one of 135 free settlers who presented
an address of welcome to Governor Bligh on his
arrival (afterwards the country presented him
mostly with bricks). This old pioneer had three
daughters, natives of Sydney. One married
William Charles Wentworth, a second Richard
Hill, M.L.C., and the third married George
Bloodsworth, an inn-keeper in Sussex-street.
“ Ku-Klux ” : I got a ticket for the gallery
of the dullest theatre in Melbourne, the other
day. I stayed 20 minutes, and during that time
two things struck me forcibly. One was the
monotonous regularity of Peacock’s “hear, hear,”
whenever Irvine spoke in a loud tone. The other
was the scarcely-veiled contempt with which
Irvine _ greeted the Kookaburra’s attenipts at
cordiality. Peacock isn’t an Opposition nowr;
he’s an echo.
W. D. Beazley, of Victoria, is the first
straight-out member of an Australian Labor
party to reach the Speaker’s chair, though for
three years J. H. Carin has been Deputy-
Speaker and Chairman of Committees in N.S.W.
Assembly. Probably, in fact, Beazley puts up a
world’s record. The first President of the Bul-
garian Sobranie was an elderly peasant who
couldn’t read, but it isn’t recorded that he was a
Labor member.
The Rev. N. M. Hennessy, of Sydney
(who seems to hold a brief for the Patman, who,
his Master declared, would have considerable
difficulty in entering the Kingdom of Heaven,
and who is anything but an admirer of the class
from which his alleged Master sprang) has been
exhorting men who make their wealth in N.S.W.
to enter its Parliament “and cleanse it, and bring
in a standard of manners, and a patriotic ambi-
tion that will make the bounder crowd, that
never understood the country’s good .....
drag themselves from the Chamber in which
they never should be found.” The gentle
preacher speaks rashly and in ignorance.
Had he been in N.S.W. during the bad old
days of unpaid politicians, when Parlia-
ment contained mostly men who had made or
were making money in the State, and if lie
had heard their language, listened to their wild
invitations to “come outside,” and heard one
honorable member cast dishonorable reflections on
the female ancestors of another honorable member,
he would have realised that the present “ bounder
crowd’’ are a set of quiet, refined gentlemen by
comparison with the people he wants to put in
their places.

“Chasselas” from South-western Victoria :
The Age sa.vs :—“ Under the Duffy Act of 1862, in the
Camperdown district, out of 699 selectors there were not
250 genuine cases ; 1,250,000 acres were alienated under
this grand Act, and 1,000,000 of them passed directly into
the hands of the big squatters. The land at the time was
worth more than four times the amount given for it, and
it paid squatters to give dummies a big consideration to
sell and clear out.” As the owners did not comply even
with the provisions of the loose Land Act under which
they obtained their titles, the State practically gave these
gentlemen of the old colonial school a present of its
richest land per medium of Duffy, and the jobbery
stinks like a tortoise to this day. Yet the Age
says nothing of a land-tax, but prefers to try to exact
something in the way of inconie-tax from the dairy
tenants who run their joyless existence for the landlord’s
benefit. Just now, to defeat Tom Mann and socialists,
and stop the exodus of population until times get better,
they are supporting Irvine and monkeying with the Com-
pulsory Resumption Land Act. Meanwhile, the big
estates are cutting up as fast as they can, on outrageous
terms, to establish a precedent. When the Government
arrives at its Resumption Act there will be little to
resume which Is not loaded up to thrice its value.
HE POUND RELIEF.
George Rudkin, Town Clerk, Kumara, says :—
“I have very great pleasure in stating that,
having used Chamberlain’s Pain Balm in a very
severe attack of sciatica, I found immediate relief.
Had before tried many other embrocations for the
same purpose, but found this the most efficacious.
Several of my friends who have been afflicted with
rheumatism have, on my advice, tried Chamber-
lain’s Pain Balm with equally good results. I
confidently recommend it to those in need of a
good household liniment or embrocation.” Sold
everywhere at Is. 6d.*
“ B.” : Met a ship’s captain just now who
told me he was off to the China coast with a local
charter. “ We might pick up a line or two from
the Chows to bring back. But if we don’t, we
won’t lose much. We will go into dock there and
be overhauled top and bottom. No seven shillings
a day over there. See ! ” A necessary part of
the Navigation Act will be to provide that all
Australian-registered ships be docked and re-
fitted in Australia, except in cases of emergency.
The shipping laws of most civilised countries have
such a provision.

Spruce Myth’s brutal method of stating
his economic principles does incalculable service
to the cause of progress and humanity. Those
unconsciously going his way are shocked when
Myth explains where such principles will land
them. Eulogising the law of supply and demand
in the House of Reps., the other day, he argued
that if a person desired a horse he bought it on
the very.cheapest terms, and, similarly, he ought
to get his work done for the very lowest wage
human beings will accept. The realisation that
in Spruce Myth’s school of thought a workman is
just a horse—something that works naked in
chains, and is flogged when it doesn’t go fast
enough, and is shot when it is worn out—was a
whole treatise on the Freetrade ideal of buying in
the cheapest market.

It was-only the other day that early closing was
denounced as “ a gross interference,” &c., and a
piece of “socialistic legislation”; yet to-day the
Victorian Shopkeepers’ and Traders’ Association
—which no one would accuse of being socialistic —
actually asks Chief Secretary Murray : (1) To
have all business places, including banks, public
offices, ,&c., .compulsorily closed on a weekly
half-holiday, this to apply to the country, as well
as the metropolis; and (2) that the police shall
take stringent action against all offenders, and
that provision be made fora minimum as well as a
maximum fine for breaches of the law. The demo-
cratic party leads the way in reform, while the
Fat Man denounces it for “driving capital out of
the country,” and so on. Then, when the reform
comes, the Fat Man finds it makes things better
instead of worse, and he approves of it cordially,
without retracting any of the lies, he uttered about
it or giving one word of credit to the pioneers of
the movement. Then the next suggestion of
reform finds him cursing with all the old activity.

440 Jones-street, Ultimo, Sydney,
October 14th, 1902.
Dear Sirs : My little daughter
suffered from birth with eruptions of
the skin and also had a weak chest and throat.
Her breathing was difficult and labored, and
it often seemed to us as if she was choking.
The measures I took only succeeded in giving
her relief of a temporary kind, so that she inva-
riably relapsed into her former condition. A
friend recommended me to give Scott’s Emul-
sion a trial. From the commencement, the
benefit Scott’s Emulsion afforded my child
has been remarkable: her skin has become
clear and pure; there is no further trouble
either with her throat or chest, and she is now
all that can be desired both in health and
spirits. Had I not given her Scott’s Emul-
sion at the time I did she would have sunk
into consumption. Faithfully yours,
(Signed) Mrs. E. Lees.
Messrs. Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney.
HOW DO YOU SOLVE THE
PROBLEM presented when a child is
suffering from general weakness with particu-
lar indications of a weak chest and throat, and
with some annoying skin eruption ? If you
solve that problem right, that is, if you put
the child out of its misery by obtaining a cure,
which would be the right way to solve the
problem, you will do so by the use of Scott’s
Emulsion. Scott’s Emulsion will solve the
problem for you much more quickly than you
can obtain a solution by any other means l
We do not need to give a description of the
trouble that annoys your child. Want you
want to hear from us at once, and briefly, is
the name of the remedy. That is
SCOTT'S EMULSION* itisnot
we alone who make this assertion ; it is made
above by one who has seen the cure per-
formed, one of many who has found out the
value of Scott’s Emulsion for herself. Scott’s
Emulsion acts from the first, clearly and
promptly, and successfully. It has cured con-
ditions similar to those described above in
every country in the world, and will cure them
in Australia. You have one precaution only to
take: and that is to see that on the wrapper
of the bottle there is a picture of a man carry-
ing a big cod-fish; if that cod-fish is not
there, you are not getting what we promise
you—a cure! You can obtain a sample of
Scott’s Emulsion, and the choicest children’s
booklet of the year, “A Bunch of Roses,”
beautifully printed in colors, by sending sd.
to Bcott and Bowne, Ltd., 483 Kent-street,
Sydney, and mentioning this paper. All
chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.
Preferential Trade.
There have been remarks from various quarters,
during last month, on the subject of Preferential
Trade with Britain—mostly illustrative of the
foolish habit that public men in Australia have of
throwing unnecessary eloquence about in a reck-
less fashion. The Protection Union :
Great Britain’s greatest living statesman, Mr. Chamber-
lain, finding the ruin that free imports have brought to
British industry, calls on the colonies for help in a policy
of Preferential Trade. Protectionists answer that call
with a loyal and glad assent. Freetraders refuse to give
the Mother Country-any advantage over foreigners. Pro-
tectionists unanimously accept Mr. Chamberlain’s call
for Preferential and Reciprocal Trade, with a loyal love to
the Empire. Freetraders would help the foreigners to
ruin the Empire.
Ex-Premier Barton :
With regard to Preferential Trade, the Government is
of the belief that it can be carried out quite consistently
with the maintenance of our own tariff for the purposes
for which we framed it, while giving for purposes of
Imperial cohesion an advantage which no Freetrade
policy can give to our own kith and kin.
Opposition leader Reid :—
If this tariff is to remain as it is, I am going to tell the
people of Australia that, no matter what they do in Eng-
land, I shall make no bargain with the people of that
country. I shall ask them for nothing. But I shall ask
the people of Australia to take down half the wall which
shuts us in from the mother country. I would not mock
the people of England with anything less, and I leave it
to them to fight out their own battles as to what is good
for them. I know that it must be good for them for us
to do what I propose. It has been hard enough upon
them, when they have given us our land, our lives, and
our humanity, to find a wall erected against them. They
have always had power enough to smash these walls
down, but they have been too noble to attempt to use the
slightest indication of pressure. When we are dealing
with people like that, we should be honest and frank
with them, and tell them what we mean.
Chamberlain himself seems to be the only man
who continues to say nothing definite on the pre-
ferential trade or Protection issue which he has
raised ; and until he does say something definite
there is no call for anyone in Australia to become
excited and promise things. With all the elo-
quence and scream now being devoted to the
“proposals of Mr. Chamberlain ’’—which so far
he hasn’t proposed—Australian public men are
putting their country into the position of a young
woman who is eager to say on what terms she
will marry the man before she is asked.
If, as is a possible outcome of the present
situation in Britain, Chamberlain persuades
that country to move in the direction of
Protection, undoubtedly Australia should be glad
to talk reciprocity ; considerations of business
will urge in that direction. But, so far, no assur-
ances or promises are in order. The Protection
Union blatherskite about a “loyal and glad
assent ” to a question which has not been asked is
foolish, because what Chamberlain proposes may
be something to which Protectionists cannot pos-
sibly assent. Ex-Premier BARTON’sstatement, which
is on all-fours with the views of the Canadian
Government, is, on the whole, the most sensible
yet made; if Australia decides to give a tariff pre-
ference to Britain, it would best take the form of
an increase of duties on non-British imports. But
even his guarded assurance is a good deal
too.previous. It would be a foolish step—and a step
which Australia almost certainly would not take—
to concede such a tariff preference to Britain and
get nothing in return, whilst losing heavily by re-
prisals from the non-British countries, which are,
on the whole, our most valuable customers. As
for George Reid’s top-note of loyalty, it shows
sheer midsummer madness. A 50 per cent, re-
duction of the tariff on British goods would shut
out imports from other countries in very many
lines and lead to a drop of about 40 per cent, in
the present tariff revenue. Reid may hope that
that fall would be made up for by a huge
increase, in imports, and a consequent general
destruction of local industries and an utter
inability to pay for the extra imports except out
of loans. In either case it would be a per-
nicious thing for Australia—a loss of fully one-
third of the customs revenue, or an increase in
imports of about 65 per cent. It is probable
that, Chamberlain having now given himself a
free hand by resigning from the British Cabinet,
some definite proposals will come; when they do,
it will be time for Australia to speak. Mean-
while, the rush to accept proposals that haven’t
been .made, and'to approve cordially without any
definite knowledge as to what we are approving,
is a ridiculous process of signing a blank cheque.
—" ♦
Lunacy Reform.
At length some definite action is likely to be taken
in Victoria for improving the method of dealing
with the insane. Two recent cases—those of
Esther Layton, the St. Kilda hermit, and
Robert Parker, the patriot who called on the
Governor-General with a gun—have brought
home, even to the unwieldy mind of officialdom,
the necessity of providing a receiving-house where
persons with “peculiarities,” and nothing more,
may be observed. It is an insult to civilisation
that people of this class should be forced to herd
with hopeless maniacs. The removal of maniacs,
who are a menace to the public safety, to a
place of restraint, is as desirable as the in-
carceration of the dangerous criminal. In fact,
the difference between them is growing harder to
define every day. But to lock the harmless or
merely suspected lunatic away in an asylum
along with incurables, and compel him to associate
with the most serious cases, is simply doing all
that is possible to make his case hopeless. With-
out doubt there is a certain uncanniness about
even the mildest cases of insanity, and it is as
much to the advantage of the public as the patients
that they should be removed from association with
saner people. At present this removal must be to
the general asylum, where overcrowding renders
proper classification impossible, and the chance of
recovery is remote. There is a natural horror
about the phrase “going into the asylum,” and,
as a consequence, mental cases seldom receive
skilled advice until so far advanced that they
are either hopeless or at least difficult. The
matter has already been considered in Maori-
land, and institutions are to be established
where suspicious oases will he treated, and per-
haps, in many instances, prevented from develop-
ing into actual insanity. The asylums are also to
be cleared of children and aged persons, whose
removal will make room for more serious cases.
With a view to allaying the popular -prejudice]
“ mental hospital ” and “patient’’are to lie sub-
stituted for the more familiar “asylum” and
“lunatic,” which are words to be as little used as
possible. Victoria, which, in the management of
its lunatics, has drifted' back to the methods of
the Bedlams of a century ago, is now threatening
to do something of the same kind, though it is
bqst not to hope for too much. The dreadful
desire to save money is always getting in the road'
in Victoria. - - - -

Fourpence per Dozen
when produced by
Eckersley’s Improved Aerated Water Machines
Owing to the number of unscrupulous imitators attempting to exploit a
tradeAvhich by virtue of the superiority of our machines we hold, we desire
to point out to intending purchasers
(1) That our machines are used solely by His Majesty’s Australian
Squadron, after an exhaustive trial, in which other so-called aerating
machines competed.
(2) That on all the Victorian Railway Refreshment Rooms, after careful
trial and examination, our machines were unanimously selected for
the excellence and purity of the aerated waters produced by them.
(3) That the leading Hotels and Clubs throughout Australasia have dis-
carded all other makes of machines and have given burs the preference.
(4) Being by fa'r the largest importers of Puie, Natural, Liquefied Carbonic
Gas in Australia, we can insure to purchasers of our machines an
unfailing supply of this gas.
A few of the hundreds of users of our machines are given below, and
they will be pleased to furnish inquirers! with their opinions thereon : —

South Kalgurli (W. A.) has just made the costly
experiment of sending 210 tons of ore to be treated at
Boulder No. 1 battery for the insignificant return of 13oz.,
equivalent to l'24dwt. per ton. The loss on this transac-
tion must be £150, and heaven only knows what it was
done for. The big heap of residues, which late manager
Isles always asserted were valueless after leaving the
Riecken vats, is to be re-treated by the ordinary cyanide
process. The mine is said to be absolutely depleted of
pay ore, but the main shaft is now being carried down
with the view of opening up deeper levels. Very little
work has been done on the Perseverance lode in the
sulphide zone, and the west portion of the property is
practically untouched below 300ft. The treatment plant
is to be brought up to date, so as to be in readiness when
the mine is again at a producing stage. As the Brown’s
furnaces and Riecken plant are to be scrapped, the
remodelled plant will be practically new.
* * * *
Kalgurli (W.A.) continues to give a good
account of itself both in monthly output and in
dividends. The 2s. 6d., payable October 6, is the
fourth this year, making a total of £60,000, or 50 per
cent, on the issued capital. Work is going on simul-
taneously at 10 levels, the deepest being 1050ft., so that
the monthly returns of ounce ore give a very fair idea of
the real average value of the mine. The ore reserves are
now a long way ahead of the treatment plant, which will
probably soon be extended. Three lodes are being
worked, the west, middle and east, the first-named being
the best and most uniform. All round Manager Ross has
done first-class work.
* * • •
Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie (W. A.), is at last
to start erecting another 50-head of stamps in continua-
tion of the new 50-head mill. The original 60-head, which
were erected on the cap of the lode, and are consequently
not too safe, will be run as long as they will save gold.
The original Martin’s air compressor, which formerly gave
trouble, has lately been overhauled, and will again be put
in work. This will enable another 20 drills to be used, so
that development may be pushed ahead faster. Whether
No. 4 lode is in the Boulder, as alleged by manager
Hamilton, or in the Horseshoe, as stated by-manager
Sutherland, is a moot point. In any case, the Horseshoe
has large reserves of ore in sight, and a series of other
lodes to fall back upon, if, unfortunately, the rich No. 4
has deserted its ground. It is more than likely that
the lode has split, and that one leg is in each mine.
• * * •
Princess Royal, Norseman (W.A.), shareholders
seem to be anything but a happy family, judging from
recent rowdy meetings over the proposed purchase of the
Central blocks on the east. Considering that negotiations
for the purchase of these blocks were opened two years
ago, the directors can hardly be congratulated on their
rate of progress. The statement made by one of the
directors, that it had taken seven years to get down to
380ft., and that consequently it would take another seven
years to reach 760ft., is not very reassuring to holders of
scrip, and does not say much for the energy of directors.
It was practically admitted that the Board had been lying
low with the view of squeezing the neighboring Central,
and apparently this policy is to be prolonged. It would
be much more satisfactory to come to some amicable
arrangement, as, sooner or later, a new shaft will have to
be sunk near the Central boundary ; the reef is dipping
so flat that the present shaft can hardly serve another
level. Unless the reef dies out, which is very unlikely, it
must eventually make into the Central ground, and, if
such is once proved to be the case, the Central blocks as
a mine will be a far more valuable property than the
outcrop property, which, even according to Captain
Treloar’s own estimate, will lose the reef at an average
depth of 1000ft. The Sons of Gwalia and the Great
Fingall Consols are already working deep level blocks
acquired after the co.’s were originally floated, and, but
for these acquisitions, they would both be nearing the end
of their tether.
• • • •
Bellevue Prop., Mb. Sir Samuel (W.A.), is the
scene of great activity, as portions of the new 40-head
mill, which is to supersede the present treatment plant,
are now arriving.on the ground. The mine has recently
been placed in charge of H.’C. Vail, a’Murkan engineer,
and since his advent thing's have hummed. Previously the
new main shaft was progressing 3 to 4ft. a month, now it
is going at the rate of 30 to 40ft. The property is
traversed by a very wide lode, running in places up to
30 to 40ft., which has so far been producing about 1800
tons monthly of 17 to 18dwt. ore. The new mill is ex-
pected to treat 4500 tons at least for a yield of 3500oz.,
and, as the old mill has been more than paying its way, it
is anticipated that the co. will be on the div. list early
next year. This mine is one of the best outside the
Golden Mile.
• • • •
Ironsides, North Kalgurli (W. A.), into which
shareholders have been beguiled into paying 6d. calls for
the past year or two, has just cleared up 57 tons for ,
4oz. 7dwt., an average of per ton. And yet share-/
holders have again and again been told that the mine was £
looking well, and that ore was being bagged for treatment, i
The co. appears to be an absolute wild cat, which will
never give holders a run for their money. Hannan’s
Prop, shareholders also have long been gulling themselves
with the yarn that they would get the same lode in the
Queen of the West lease, and that it was of a payable
character. The result of this crushing should about open
their eyes.
* • * »
The August yield of the W.A. mines tots up to
206,617oz., and brings the total of the first eight months
of the year to l,640,882oz., as against l,476,063oz. for the
same period of last year. This shows an improvement of
164,819oz. The gain is really far more, as quite a dozen
mines, including such large producers as G.B. Persever-
ance, Great Fingall Consols, Ivanhoe, Oroya-Brown Hill,
Sons of Gwalia, Cosmopolitan, etc., are now stating their
returns in fine gold worth £4 4s. lljd. per oz.
* * ; * *
Oroya-Brown Hill (W.A.) has very 1 - nearly
aompleted the extension of its treatment plant, and its
full 50-head mill should be runrting some time-.in October.
When in full swing the plant should treat about 7000 tons
monthly, and very materially increase'returhs'and profits.
The reserves of ore have been considerably augmented of
late, as the new underground boss, Williams, found that
the stopes above the fifth level of the Brown Hill had been
filled with pay ore, which is now being sent to the mill.
He also found new bodies of high grade ore at the same
level by drilling into the foot and hanging walls. On the
Oroya north block the winze below No. 10 level has gone
down all the way in 6oz. ore. Too much notice need not
be taken of this, as the winze follows the rich chute on its
dip, and practically scoops out all the rich ore. This was
done also in the Associated Northern.
* * - - » *
Golden Ridge (W.A.), which was discarded by
John Bull as a wild cat after much money had been spent
in equipment and development, looks as if it would
shortly yield large returns to the local syndicate that re-
pegged it. To-date, mine has produced 7128oz. from'
6778 tons, the latest return being: 6230 z. from 465 tons.
From proceeds of gold won the syndicate purchased the
adjacent Waterfall property, which is now connected by
tramline, and very shortly 20 head of stamps will be
producing over lOOOoz. monthly. The chief difficulty is
scarcity of water.
* * » •
Cumberland, Niagara (W.A.), which has been
in existence for over five years, is to be reconstructed
with 120,000 shares, or 20,000 more than previously.
Shareholders in the old co. will have the doubtful
privilege of buying one new share for each five old shares,
and will likewise get share for share in the newcO. fully
paid up. The co. owns 84 acres, and is equipped with a
20-head mill, which has crushed regularly since March,
1899. The average was originally 13dwt. from the plates,
but latterly has dwindled to 6Adwt.
* * * •
North Kalgurli (W.A.) is getting short of funds,
and all underground work has been stopped pending
starting of mill. If the mine cannot pay its way in
future, another reconstruction will be inevitable. The
co. appears safe for a year at least; but, as there will be
no funds for undertaking further development, it looks
as if, sooner or later, something unpleasant would happen.
• • • *
Golden Pole’s, Davyhurst(W.A.), initial crushing
is a long way short of expectations ; 600 tons yielded only
11490 z., worth £4400, whereas it was predicted that a
monthly profit of £SOOO, equivalent to a div. of 6d. a
share, would be earned. The mill ran 21 days only, so
that with a full month’s run, the tonnage will be con-
siderably augmented. As the new plates would absorb
a fair quantity of gold it is premature to say what the
mine is really capable of.
* • • •
Total divs. paid by W.A. mines during Sep-
tember tot up £138,285, against £72,860 for September,
1902. Companies responsible are : Great Boulder Prop.,
£65,625 ;• Oroya Brown Hill, £45,000; Brown Hill Ex-
tended, £20,000; Princess Royal, £4000; Queensland
Menzies, £3300; Lancefield, £360.
The Bulletin is informed that ib isn’t
true that M'Culloch, M.L.0., is the principal
part of the M'Oulloch Carrying Cos. In fact, it is
assured that the man who gave the co. its name
isn’t now even a shareholder. Also an explana-
tion is offered regarding the concession which was
made to the co. last year by the Victorian
Government for bringing farmers’ trade to the
railways. The concession, it is alleged, only ex-
tended to N.S.W. wool which otherwise might
not have gone to Melbourne, and the owners and
not the co. got most of the benefit of it; and,
anyhow, it wasn’t as big a concession as has been
reported.

Writes a Hobart pressman :
The late Nicholas J. Brown, Speaker of Tas. Assembly,
was conspicuously Tasmania’s most gentlemanly legisla-
tor. Politically, Brown’s qualities were such as can only
move a democrat’s derision ; but, personally, Brown was
a genial and estimable man, a perfect host, and at all
points a very amiable companion. As Speaker he was
suave and placid, with a pronounced Tory bent and a
habit of giving magnificently improper decisions
with a very magnanimous serenity He was of the
old school; and however little love is due to
the old school in . 1903, Nicholas Brown will be
mourned by many as an excellent fellow who
passed away over-early. Nicholas Brown was Hobart
agent and representative of the Lyell company. This
same company recently sacked Labor-man J. J. Long, on
the stated ground that the Lyell company would not
employ members of Parliament. Circumstances alter
c*ses.
N.S.W. Minister Kidd went up the Moun-
tains last Monday to “ formally open ” a motor
car service from Blackheath to Jenolan—to open
a sort of omnibus, in fact. One great reason why
N.S.W. never gets any decent local government,
any graduated land-tax, absentee-tax, closer settle-
ment law, Upper House reform, any State Land
Bank worth mentioning, why its finances are awful
and its debt ditto, is that Ministers haven’t time
to attend to big things—they have got to go and
“ formally open ” some darned bush omnibus or
other. And in course of time there has developed
the Minister who is only fit to ‘‘ formally open ”
the new omnibus, and the corresponding Parlia-
ment is developing. B. R. Wise is about the only
N.S.W. politician now who is above the omnibus-
opening level.
Attorney - General Wise introduces to
N.S.W. Council this week a Bill to change the
law position created by the “Taff Vale decision.”
The marrow of the Bill is that workers may
combine to ameliorate (1) their own conditions ,of
employment or (2) the conditions of others; and
in combination may refuse to work for or with
any person ; and ‘ ‘ may use any means which
are now or may be lawful to be used
by any combination of traders in pursuit
of gain, or by any other lawful means.” Further,
no union is liable for the actions of any
agent, if 3uch actions are performed contrary to
the instructions of the union and are repudiated
bona,fide by the union. And the Arbitration Act,
Sec. 7 (2) (a), is so amended as to make it plain
that a union registering as an industrial union is
thereby relievedx>f all pains and penalties except
such as are provided in the Industrial Arbitration
Act.

At Poverty Point.
A defeated Parliamentary candidate who has any pre-
tensions as an orator is always certain of a position as a
“ door talker ” for a side show. A door man was wanted
the day after a recent election. The defeated candidate
grabbed the position in front of twenty applicants, and is
now vigorously engaged in drawing the attention of the
passer-by “to the greatest show on earth visible inside
for the small sum of sixpence.”
The Maoriland musicians who went to England saloon
and came back steerage, after drumming through the
Cold Country with dire financial results, knocked against
surprises everywhere. Big magnates, who seemed to look
upon them as wandering curiosities, asked if their
“colony” had sent any men to the Boer war, as Canada
had done. “ Why,” returned the flabbergasted minstrels,
“we sent thousands 1 ” “Good gracious 1” was the in-
variable reply, “we never heard of it.” Yet the poor,
simple Maorilanders thought that, after Seddon’s great
advertising freak, the whole world knew it, and that the
band would get tremendous receptions everywhere.
Its arrival, however, only sent people scurrying through
geographies to see where on earth Maoriland was, and if
it was really connected with Asia by a bridge.
“ F.”: Why doesn’t Ada Orossley give more “ sacred ’’
songs? A contralto voice should never try to frivol or
to be passionate ; it cannot pierce through the air as a
sword of poignant feeling, or run up the scale of emotion
on little wings of violet and red flame. Its metier is to
express a massive British grief with a suggestion of
Divine consolation—the sentiment of the widow who is
gluttonously sorrowful in her fine weeds and her great
house with the photograph of the deceased’s splendid
mausoleum over the mantel-shelf.
“ J.A.G.” : Re “ 0.K.” on “ Midsummer Night’s

and was, all round, about the best that has been seen

“ Lion-tamer ” Pagel, who nightly monkeys with a lion
at Wirth’s Circus, can’t expect to be always merely
scratched on the forearm, as happened the other night.
Already, no doubt, some morbid people are following
him round in the expectation of seeing the lion bite off
his head.
Only once while in Melbourne did pianist Hambourg let
himself off the chain. This was when the softgocds
fraternity lured him round to its club and made him
listen to the tootlings of some of the dimmer musical
lights. Mark was afterwards taken off, and somebody
proposed his health. The lion joined in drinking to
himself, and did not attempt a reply, but impatiently
shook his mane and said, “Now for billiards.” Hambourg
is a fine billiardist, and would be still finer if his hair did
not get into his eyes.
Charles Hugo, the one-time versatile Buffalo minstrel,
died at Auckland (M.L.), t’other day, after a long spell
of adversity and sickness.
“ Madame Sans Gfine ” is about to be comic-operatised
in London under the title of “ The Duchess of Dantzig.”
The idea of a little stout Napoleon breaking out in song
and dance is perhaps slightly too iconoclastic.
Josephine Scantlebury writes: “ Comparison of the
voices and positions in the musical world of Clara Butt
and Ada Crossley is absurd. Clara Butt is over 6ft. high,
made in proportion—a tower of strength, and a voice of
such power that it appals you to listen. Clara Butt never
was and never will be an artiste. A voice of such sledge-
hammer magnitude must, of necessity, be rough, and
cannot be subdued to touch the heart. It is like a torrent
that sweeps all before it. I heard her in the Albert Hall
with full organ accompaniment, with forte stops all on ;
but above all rang out the trumpet notes, ‘ God who made
thee mighty, make thee mightier yet.’ The strain was
so great I felt thankful when it was over. Ada Crossley
is the most artistic singer I have ever heard. A rich and
velvet voice, full of pathos, whose sympathetic quality of
tone touches the heart and makes you feel ‘ a lump in the
throat.’ What strikes the hearer most is the evenness
and ease of the production, and the particular richness
of the middle and upper register and clearness of enunci-
ation. She is the sweetest singer of the day, and in her
subdued and sympathetic style has no equal.”


The drunkest train in all Maoriland, and
almost the drunkest in Australasia, is the one that
leaves Dunedin (M.L.) for Port Chalmers at 11.30
p.m. on Saturdays. Port Chalmers is a Pro-
hibition town now; the lumpers and such-like are
paid on Saturday, and they have the afternoon to
spend and the long, dry Presbyterian Sunday to
provide against. Dunedin hotels close at 10, but
the bar at the station remains open till the last
passenger train leaves, and then it takes six
policemen at least to shovel out the incapables
and load them into the train. Sometimes
the wrong incapable is thrown into the
wrong train, but it is necessary to clear
the place up, and the stray and unaccount-
able drunks are hurled in at random, and the
locomotive goes off breathing beer and vengeance.
When a busy and not very respectable seaport
has to concentrate its week’s drinking into Satur-
day evening the results are terrible. Port Chal-
mers is a dismal place on Sunday morning. The
heavy breathing of the drunks who are recovering
in bed sounds like a breeze shaking the bones on a
gallows, and the feet of the lost drunks —the ones
who were cleared up promiscuously when Dunedin
shut up for the night—are not beautiful on the
highways as they wander about asking the name
of the town and how they got there.
“L.W.”: “Should a widow marry?”
Certainly—if she can prove to an impartial
examination board that she can cook. If she can-
not cook—certainly not; the chances are ten to
one it was her bad cooking that killed the original
old man; in fact the cemeteries are full of the
bodies of men who were killed by their wives’
bad cooking. Probably the Other Place is full of
their souls. If a widow can cook she should be
made to re-enter the married state. For the busy ;
man the widow is invaluable. She conies to him
clothed in her former experience ; she is a skilled
hand and not a raw apprentice. She knows what
men require, and better still, what they like.
When he comes home on the rim of his hat, in-
stead of threatening to go home to ma, she bustles
round to get her lord and master fit for the office
next day. When a man marries a spinster it is
six months before he even dares to stay out late,
let alone come home on the rim of his hat. Then
he has to spend several years teaching her the
things she pretends she never even heard of, and
much valuable time is wasted bringing her to a
proper state of forgetfulness of things that it is
better she should disremember. All this is saved
by marrying a widow ; she starts off the same
mark with the man, so to speak.
An indignant Launceston man sends a few
facts anent the management of the smallpox out-
break in reply to B. (12/9/’03):
At the commencement of the smallpox outbreak the
Central Board of Health sent to Launceston its secretary,
a most estimable young man with no previous experience
whatever, and he, after being in the city for some days,
did absolutely nothing, and did it very well. The Central
Board exhibited every symptom of hysterical scare, and
issued fresh orders almost every day. Those objected to
by the citizens of Launceston were the ones which isolated
the city by ordering the placing of patrols at all outlets
and the prosecution of persons leaving unless vaccinated.
The Central Board also hysterically demanded the imme-
diate removal to the hospital of all patients, while the
hospital was not in a fit state to receive them, and the
wholesale vaccination of everybody while there was no
lymph with which to vaccinate them. Launceston’s
“ delirium” and “ insurrection ” consisted of a public
meeting protesting against the illegal isolation of
the city, and an impromptu procession emphasised
the protest by marching past the patrol at one of the
outlets of the city. Dr. M'Call, Chief Secretary, came to
Launceston as Chairman of the Central Board of Health,
and every measure he suggested was carried out, though
it must be conceded that our local officer of health did
not afford him that support which it is considered he
should have received. The first certain news of the out-
break was received on the 22nd June, and not until July
7th did Dr. M‘Call give authority for the erection of
additional wards at the hospital. Up to that date the
entire accommodation consisted of four small wards of
1300 cubic feet each, intended for the use of eight
patients, thus allowing 650 cubic feet of space for each,
and as it is generally conceded that small-pox patients
should have at least 1500 cubic feet each, it may be
imagined that the accommodation was not first-class.
The Central Board of Health had supreme control over
the hospital; the local Board had no authority at all, but
as time was passing Dr. M'Call, on his own initiative,
gave the local Board authority to construct a couple of
additional wards, of which the first was put up in a few
days, and the second only a short time afterwards, giving
accommodation for 16 additional patients. These wards
were erected by the local Board, and afterwards other
wards were added by the Central Board. That the
measures adopted by the local Board were effective is
proved’ by the fact that nothing was altered after the
appointment of Dr. Elkington, and that the epidemic
was practically “collared 4 ’ before the doctor’s arrival.
As to the decision of the Government not to charge the
cost of combating the epidemic to this year’s revenue, no
one condemns this senseless proceeding of “passing on”
extraordinary expenses more than I.
Thechurches have, for somereasonor other,
always opposed sanitary progress. They seem to
have acquired a taste for unclean methods.
Cremation, as opposed to the hideous practice of
planting dead bodies in and around the cities, has
receivedno encouragement from the churches. The
repulsive methods of administering the wine in
the Communion services have long been objected
to by the clean, decent party of civilisation. A
Colac doctor raised the question again at a Pres-
byterian meeting. He gave a case where 50 per-
sons had sipped from the same cup, and declared
that such a state of things was inimical to health,
and that the danger of contagion was very great.
Writing on this subject two years ago Dr. Gress-
well, the chairman of the Melbourne Board of
Health, said :
I do not suppose that any physician, any pathologist,
any bacteriologist, would venture to say that the drink-
ing of wine from a vessel from which another or other
persons had previously drunk (the vessel having been
merely wiped in the intervals while being passed from
one person to another) would not involve risk of con-
traction of infection of various sorts, such as diphtheria,
tuberculosis, &c. ; while repugnance to such pro-
cedure, if not the gravest apprehension of danger of
infection, would, I think, be at once aroused if such a
disease as cancer of the lips or mouth were borne in mind.
Years of Torture
MR. JAS. LANE, OF ROSE HILL, ORANGE, CURED OF CHRONIC SCIATICA.
AN OLD MAN’S STORY.
No farmer is better known in the Canoblas
District than Mr. James B. Lane, who lives at
Rose Hill, three miles from Orange. As his
wife says, “ they are as well known as the Town
Clockin Sydney.” Mr. Lane has been a martyr
for years to Sciatica, which no doctor has been
able to cure. Off and on, for thirty years, he
has suffered, experiencing that fearful grind-
ing, agonising pain, which all Sciatic and
Rheumatic patients know only too well. Mrs.
Lane, in a recent visit to the Specialists of
The Freeman and Wallace Institute, told
them of his marvellous recovery, through
wearing their ONE POUND ELECTRIC
“INVIGORATOR” BELT,’ and adopting
their Remedies. Here is her story
“You say your husband has suffered for
thirty years ? ” asked the Specialist.
“Yes. Off and on,” replied Mrs. Lane,
“he has suffered fearfully. Last winter, in
1902, he was confined to his bed; His right
foot and leg were swollen greatly. He was
never free from the pain, and never expected
to get well.”
“How long has he been under treatment?”
“He wrote for one of your Orte Pound
Electric 4 Invigorator ’ Belts about twelve
months ago, and took your medicines; He
improved from the start. ”
“And what is his condition now!”
“He is so well that he can go without the
stick he used for years. He Can now ride
round the paddocks for his coWs ; a thing he
could not do before. Anyone at Rose Hill
can prove this, and I think it all the more re-
markable because of his great age. Had he been
younger it would not have been so wonderful.”
“How old is he?”
“Seventy-three years old,” replied Mrs.
Lane, with pride, “but thanks to you and
your wonderful Belt, he is the picture of
health to-day. It is really a wonderful cure.
I am glad to be able to speak of it to you.”
“We are glad we have done him good.”
“Good is not the name for it. When I
think of how he suffered, and look at him now,
I can scarcely understand so great a change
for the better. I have brought the Belt to see
if it wants re-charging. Will there be any
price to pay? We do not understand it ex-
actly, but we have followed your instructions
as to its wear correctly.”
“There will be no charge whatever. We
will hand it to our professional electrician,
who supervises these matters. _ It will be
ready in a day or two. Call again and see us.
We shall be glad to see you at any time and
hear you tell such a pleasing story.”
“I think everybody should know of this
wonderful recovery,’’ said Mrs. Lane, as she
left the Consulting Room. “Persons suffering
from Sciatica might be. cured as well as my
husband. I am sure he is a living advertise-
ment to your wonderful skill, and to the great
powers contained in your Electric ‘ Invigo-
rator’ Belt. Is he to go on wearing it round
the waist as usual ? ”
“Yes ! if necessary. But if he is free from
all pain he need not wear it again.”
“ Very well, I’ll call for the Belt to-morrow,”
and with a smiling face, Mrs. Lane took her
departure.
This is Mrs. Lane’s story. Any sufferer should
w.'ite to the Specialists for full particulars. This is
only one case. The Specialists have thousands o
testimonies, and will mail a special pamphlet of
testimonies of cure free to any applicant.

If you have doubts about your condition and
you are not what you should be in health and
strength you can receive the SPECIALISTS’
professional opinions and advice free for the cost
of writing one letter. No delays are experienced.
Singular success has been attained in the treat-
ment and cure of the following grave disorders

LOST STRENGTH.
These wonderful strength-restoring “INVIGORATORS” are superior to any “BELT ”
sold in Australia. The SPECIALISTS of The FREEMAN and WALLACE INbTI-
TUTE will give £lOO TO ANY CHARITABLE INSTITUTION if it can be proved they are not as perfectly Electrical as
they are claimed to be. They are not to be confounded with any old-time Electric “ BELT,” sold at greater prices. ONE
POUND ONLY IS THE PRICE. The £lO “ INVIGORATOR ” contains 2oz. 18ct. gold. £8 is allowed for it on return,
even after successful use by any patient. Remember this when purchasing a “ BELT,” for which you may be asked to pay
£2O, or £5O. It possesses true non-conducting Vulcanite Insulation, without which all Electric “Belts” are absolutely
useless in medical practice. NOTHING WRECKS A MAN’S LIFE more quickly than disease. This “ INVIGORATOR ”
arrests at once the LOSS OF VITAL POWER, which degenerates and injures the system. Such diseases as INSOMNIA,
EPILEPSY, RHEUMATISM, INDIGESTION, DYSPEPSIA, SCIATICA, ST. VITUS’ DANCE, NERVOUSNESS,
HEART TROUBLE, HYSTERIA, or LUMBAGO are immediately relieved by it when worn nightly for a few hours con-
junctively with sound medical treatment. It is a sure cure in cases of Nervous Disorders classed as “incurable.”
When under treatment every patient is tinder the care of an Internationally Registered Physician and Specialist, Dr. R. WALLACE, M.D.,
L.R.C.P., E., L.F.P.S., E., L.M., who is registered by Medical Boards of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, England and America. He is the

CAUTiO
Beware of Pcrsors
advising the public
to use “ Belts With-
out Drugs,” and advise also a medical treat-
ment from medical institutes. This is a system
which speaks for itself. Beware also of those
who advertise the sale of the Freeman and
Wallace “ INVIGORATOR ” Belts for 10s., sold
for One Pound only. The Specialists employ
no agents. This is a trick to promote trade.

were more common among the children of the

trouble.”—Dr. Argyle, in a lecture on the feeding
of infants, before the Aus. Healtn Society.

A well-known society dame entered the shop
of a Collins-st. optician, the other day, and desired
to have her sight tested —but no fault could be
detected with her vision. Not satisfied, she had
almost every pair of pince-nez in the place hauled
out, and tried them on—still no result. At last
the resourceful assistant produced a beautiful
gold-rimmed affair that got her in the right
spot, and she paid the handsome price without
a murmur. Next day a very ruffled and excited
old lady again entered the shop and pounced on
that assistant. ‘ What sort of goods do you sell,
young man ? ’ she commenced. ‘ The best, madam,

They take their love-making very seriously
in Russia. A gruesome telegram in the London
papers of July 27 tells how 33 young women of
the Don district, working in the fields, locked
themselves into a barn at night “ to secure them-
selves from the importunities of farm laborers ” ;
whereupon the men, resenting this unsportsman-
like conduct, set fire to the barn and burned the
whole lot to death !
A recent commission appointed to investi-
gate the cause of the prevalence of leprosy
amongst the Kaffirs in S’Africa found that the
disease was due to the mass of badly-cured fish
sent inland from Capetown, and consumed by the
Kaffir aforesaid. This finding is to some extent
endorsed by the investigation of Jonathan
Hutchinson in India. Eleven years ago a British
commission decided that there was no connection
between leprosy and fish-eating because many
patients denied ever having eaten fish. Against
this theory Mr. Hutchinson points to the record
of a small island called Salsette lying off Bombay,
It has a population of 50,000, mostly occupied in
fishing and fish-curing. All being direct
descendants of converts made by the Jesuits during
the Portuguese occupation, the inhabitants are all
lioni an Catholics, and observe fast days and eat
fish largely, as well as catch and cure it. And Mr.
Hutchinson found that during the last eight years
all the lepers in the Bombay Presidency came
from this one small patch !

“You will be interested in hearing that I think the

“Dear Sir, —t wish to add my testimony to the won-

months, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
advice, and tried other ‘ remedies,’ without avail. I tried
yours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
first dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
may depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
wonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.

In the first Assembly under Respon-
sible Government in S. Australia (elected in
1857), three men sat for Mount Barker. One
(F. Krichauff) still survives, another (John Dunn)
lived to be 95, and the third (W. Rogers, father-
in-law of Attorney-General Gordon) has just died
at the age of 85. An 80-year-old brother of
Mr. Rogers died the day he was buried.
Treasurer Butler (S.A.) worries still over
the financial outlook, although the harvest pros-
pects are excellent. He has an “undertaker”
aspect at all times, and is taller and thinner even
than his predecessor, Holder; and he appears to
have no relaxations. Holder preached now and
then, or unbent h’imself at a tea meeting, but
Butler is unvaryingly lugubrious. Still, his eyes
do gleam with a sad joy when you tell him that
another rich man has died, and remind him that
both the wealthiest South Australians are over
80 years of age.
“Top”: Truganina, recently mentioned
in The Bulletin as a variously-spelt name, was
an old-time aboriginal belle, and absolutely the
last of the Tasmanian race. She died in the early
70’s. In the 40’s, she was in Victoria for a time,
having been brought over with some of her friends
by Aborigines Protector Robinson to assist him
in civilising the local blacks. After a while,
Truganina and her party, wanting to return to the
land of their birth, wandered away to Western
Port, having some vague notion that they would
be able to cross Bass’ Straits. When near Cape
Paterson, they decoyed ashore a vessel engaged
lu ” he _ seal trade, and murdered the crew. For
that offence, two of the male blacks were hanged
in Melbourne gaol.
“H.” : The newspapers to hand fill out
our cabled information about Pius X. It is clear
ttiat as a pcditieian, he is just as Tory as Leo
A.-LII. lhe King of Italy was much hurt because
there was no notification given him of the Pope’s
election. Consequently there is more coolness
between the Vatican and Quirinal than there was
under Leo. Pius X. has always been a marked
man by the Liberals, though they acknowledge his
benevolent character. He was stoutly opposed
by the local authorities when appointed Bishop of
Mantua. Again, his appointment as Patriarch of
Venice caused the Italian Government to raise
P°P e h a d no right to appoint to
that Patriarchate. The question was fought out
at law. Sarto is as lyird as steel on the Papal
privileges. _ There seems to be an impression that,
with all this, he will be rather a feeble Pope.
Concerning a new Judge :
F. E. Chapman caHed to the Bar in 1872, has been ap
pointed Supreme Court Judge in Maoriland, in succession
to the very aged Justice Conolly. The new Judge is a son
2r-? J e , nr £, Sara , . Chapman, who was called to the Bar at
Middle Temple in 1840. In 1843, Pa Chapman was ap-
pointed to a Judgeship in Maoriland, which he relin-
quished in 1852 for the post of Colonial Secretary in Van
Diemen s Land. He lost that office owing to his sympa-
tny with the anti-transportation party. He returned to
where he refused a West Indian Governorship.
54 he moved to Victoria, and in ’55 became a member
legislative Council. He was Attorney-General in
the first and second O’Shanassy Ministries. In 1862-63
he was an Acting-Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria
during the absence of Redmond Barry. In 1864 he was
appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court in Maoriland,
and lived in Dunedin until his death in December, 1881.
Mr. Chapman’s first wife, whom he married in 1840, was
a daughter of Mr. J. G. Brewer, barrister-at-law, and
afterwards a County Court Judge in Victoria. In 1865
Mrs. Chapman went to England, where Mr. F. R. Chap-
man was left for his legal education. The family took
passages in the ill-fated s.s. London, which foundered in
the Bay of Biscay in January, 1866.
Hall, M.L.A., of N.S.W. Labor party, the
youngest member of the Cornstalk Assembly, has
passed his final examination for the Bar. It is
pleasing to hear that no more Labor members are
pointing that way at present. The Bar is so
horribly overcrowded now that there isn’t a fair
living for half its members, nor an honest living
for one-third. And if it wasn’t for the old failures
dropping out—emigrating, turning cooks or bottle-
washers or kitchenmen, making for the Labor
Bureau, getting into gaol, or going to sleep out in
the Domain—things would be worse than they
are. Whenever The Bulletin hears of an
amateurish-looking burglary it wonders if some
lawyer has been driven to supplementing his
scanty earnings with a crowbar.
If ’Siah Symon goes out of the Senate the
vacancy should be filled by Kirkpatrick, who
stood a good seventh on the South Australian
poll. When Robert Reid was sent up in Victoria
the excuse was that if he wasn’t seventh he was,
anyhow, eighth ; and H. J. Saunders was chosen
m Westralia vice Ewing because he was the seventh
man. In South Australia, however, the political
claims of the seventh man (apart altogether from
his personal claims, which are great) are being
carefully suppressed in the interests of Louis Von
Doussa, a Conservative State member, who wasn’t
even a Federal candidate. Kirkpatrick’s offence
is simply that he is a Labor man. Von
Doussa, on the other hand, piloted through the
Assembly the Snow Tramway Bill, which has
been so huge a frost; and probably the Houses,
sitting together, will elect him as a reward for hig
great services in that connection,
Victorian Chief Secretary Murray aroused
himself from his customary lethargy when a depu-
tation from the Criminology Society waited on
him t’other day and made several sensible
remarks. He hit out at the barbarous solitary
confinement system, and declared that he was pre-
pared to recommend its abolition. “If our
Judges,” he said, “knew what solitary confine-
ment meant they would very seldom order it.”
Then he hinted that some of their Honors ought
to be treated to a personal experience of the lonely
cell which makes so many criminals and many
more idiots. Murray also said he was in favor of
imprisoning proved habitual criminals for life. It
was only fair to deprive a man of his liberty when
he abused it constantly.
That fine old Victorian gentleman,
Thomas Bent, didn’t allow even the opening
day _ of. the local Assembly to pass without
getting into conflict with a fellow member through
his studied politeness. Bromley was making
some remark about the Sandringham station*
which is being erected in Bent’s own electorate, at
the end of a hopelessly non-paying line, whilst all
the other works have been stopped by the firm
hand of Thomas. Thomas broke in with the
statement that Bromley was a fool. There is
hardly a sitting of the Victorian Assembly at
which Bent doesn’t call someone a fool; it’s his
way of replying to suggestions that he should
cover up his tracks more neatly after he has done
something that looks like a political job.


The Wail of the Back

’Tis a warning of Kidney Ills.
Backache is the Kidneys’ cry for help
the aches and pains of bad back —the
Lame Back—the Weak Back—all
tell of Kidneys sick from overwork.
Kidneys become blocked, con-
gested, inflamed.
They’re delicate little organs,
those kidneys of ours.
Weren’t intended to stand
the strain that Twentieth
Century hustle and hustle
puts on them. Most natural
thing in the world that they
should get out of order.
And when they do they
let us know about it mighty
quickly.
Send a sharp twinge in
the hack to tell us of their
need for help. It’s a warn-
ing that had best be heeded.
Serious trouble ahead if it isn t-
Backache is the beginning—the end is death, if the
warning is neglected.
No time should be wasted.
Go to their aid.
oan’s Backache Kidney pills
Will start the Kidneys work-
ing rightly, relieve the back
ache, heal the inflammation.
Remove the Backache, cure
every Kidney 111, cure Dia-
betes, and women's disorders.
They are a little remedy that
help women to bear the bur-
dens of life more easily. Make
better, happier, more capable
women of them. Are doing it
right here in Sydney.
The best proof of this lies
in the evidence of people you
know, the evidence of friends
and neighbours.
m
SYDNEY PROOF.
Mrs. Burraston, 93 Abercrombie-street, Sydney, says“ Three years ago, in
Armidale I made a statement that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me of
kidney complaint, which had afflicted me for twenty years. I have used this
remedy since I made that statement—but very little. lam pleased to tell you
that lam still well, the medicine having worked a permanent cure mmy case. 1
was real bad before I got these pills. I had frightful pains m the small of my
back • in fact, these pains were always bad. 1 could not well rise after bending,
and could not turn in my bed without crying out, it was so bad. I scarcely slept
at all excepting on the most favorable occasions. I suffered wi <i headaches, and
my sight was so dim I had to wear spectacles My secretmns were discolored
and contained a gritty deposit. At the time I got Doan s Pills I had become
hopeless of ever losing these troubles, and the effects when I used the medicine
were a most welcome surprise. The fourth dose gave me slight relief, and the
first box gave me increased energy. Not long after I was free of all pain and
headaches, and I slept splendidly every night. In fact I was cured. and cured
to stay, as time has proved. These are grand Pills for the Kidneys.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by
all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes,
15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price by Eoster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.
BUT BE SURE THEY ARE DOAN’S-
Eczema.
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any itchiness of the skm.
Piles almost drives you crazy.
All day they make you miserable.
All night they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema.
Such miseries are daily decreasing.
People are learning they can be cured.
Learning the merits of Doan s Ointment.
Plenty of proof that Doan’s Ointment will
cure Piles,
Eczema, or any irritation of the skin.
Read the testimony of a Sydney citizen
Mrs. Peters, 15 Ed ward-street, Redfern,
says :—“ About two years ago I certified that
Doan’s Ointment had cured me of E •zema, of
live years’ standing. 1 am better able to
bear the statement out now than two years
ago, as the cure has been proven since then.
I’ve been free of the itch ever since; in fact,
perfectly cured. It used to be a burning itch
on the leg that was very hard to bear. In
hot weather it used to be terrible. I had a
good deal of treatment. I had it seen to by a
number of doctors, but it baffled them, and I
was also treated as an out-door patient at the
hospital, with no better result. I came to use
Doan’s Ointment by hearing so many people
speak of it as an excellent remedy for itching
skin trouble.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of the skin, Eczema, Piles, Hives, Sores, In-
sect Bites, Chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe
and very effective. Very often two or three
pots have cured chronic case 3 where other
remedies have failed for years.
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Poster- McClellan
Co., 70 Pitt-street, Sydney.

The Great Australian Cow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sweet singers of the Southern Seas
Which lave our Austral strand,
Bard-builders of bush elegies
By poet’s sleight-of-hand,
Just hitch your brumbies to the trees
And listen to the band !
That sun-scorched clime of drink and curse,
Yclept the “ Western Plain,”
We shall not here depict in verse
Whose metres mourn in pain :
The Shearer and the Shearer’s Horse
Must rest—as we’ll explain.
Too long this woolly pair and bold
Have occupied the stage —
The songs of blood and brawn and gold
Been quite the writing rage ;
With tramps and teamsters o’er-extolled
Pervading all the page.
And when some critics trembling tried
To pass a few remarks,
Like Roman lords the poets cried,
“ The envious dingo barks ! ”
And chucked the beggar overside
And fed him to the sharks.
The swag was by verse-heroes swagged
Across a dactyl West,
Until each trocheed corpse lay snagged
With it upon his chest;
Or, fresh from flooded river dragged,
Spondeed at length to rest.
The native Muse shall now entwine
Fresh clover for the brow,
And o’er a land of palm and pine,
From Townsville to Cape Howe,
Shall sing, through Summer days ashine,
The Great Australian Cow.
With inspiration from the North
(A new and special brew),
We fain would bud and blossom forth
In praises of the Moo ;
A lacteal lyre loud strike henceforth,
To song and subject new.
Grave Brahmin bards, well versed in milk,
This singing band will be —
The horse-rugg’d Muse prepared to bilk
Of many a future fee ;
For they can flatten out that ilk
On points and pedigree.
From Milky River shall the white,
Pure inspiration spring,
The milk-cans gleaming large and bright,
The leg-rope and the ring,—
Which keeps the calf in penance trite—
These be fit themes to sing.
Those dauntless souls who danger scorn
In valor at the bails,
At sunny eve and dewy morn
In filling milking pails;
They shal, in future song, adorn
Poetic New South._Wales.
Why should the Horse for ever hold
A verse monopoly,
Horse tales in divers ways be told
And favorites beaten be,
With not a rhymer to uphold
The Austral Cow—save me?
Why should the Swagman largely loom
And all the credit steal ?
Before the bad Bushranger’s tomb
All poetasters kneel ?
For Milkmen there is surely room —
The Cow must have a deal!
Sweet singers of this mortgaged land
(In pawn to many Jews)
Get grass ! or else, converted, stand
To wider bovine views.
Behold the meek and sleeky band,
New subject for your muse !
Horse poets have we plenty bred
And teamster bards a few,
And swaggie “ potes ” have painted red
The blanket which was blue ;
But not a bardlet yet has shed
His light upon the Moo.
In “ fancy’s realms ” then let her graze,
And on your altars vow
The future source of Austral lays,
And laurels for the brow
Shall be, through all your singing days,
Your own Australian cow.
N.S.W.

The Recognition of the Native.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was morning. I was leaning over the white
railings of the wooden bridge that spans the creek,
smoking my pipe and watching a shoal of bream
swimming about in the clear water. A fish, I
reflected, always seems so much more at home in
the water than most of us are on land. So many
of us walk the earth as though we had not grown
accustomed to it. A fish is a perfect master of its
element. Poised between surface and bottom,
curving quickly or fanning the water in graceful
idleness, it moves with a flexibility of motion that
is perfect in its effortless ease. Now, look at the
fellow lurching down the road. He was born
and bred on the earth, like all of us, but
he is still a stranger to his native element. He
lumbers over it clumsily. If the soil were not
rock-ribbed he would sink through. ... I believe
he was drunk last night. ... He was—on closer
inspection I am sure of it. T
Presently he loafed up to me and asked if 1
lived in the township.
“ No,” I replied ; lam a stranger here.
“Seems to me as I am, too, mate, though I was
born here.”
Ilis teeth were irregular. Two, on the right
side of his mouth, were worn away by the pipe-
stem habitually held there. He was unshaven ;
his hair was long, black, straw-straight and the
tufts of it were ragged at the ends. Mis
moustache was like a housemaid s blacklead
brush. He chewed it at intervals.
I let him resume. “I haven’t been near the
place for nigh twenty year. Of course, I expected
to find changes, but' blow me if there s a soul in
the place that knows me.”
He spoke with so much regret in his tone that I
was interested, and inquired: “You left, then,
as a youth, I imagine ? ” . , ,
“ Yes, gettin’ on for bein’ a man. Ive humped
it a bit since, but I thought I should like to see
the township again, and ’ave a yarn with some of
my old mates, if there were any left.
“ And are there not any ? ” ,
“Well”—he took off his hat and scratched
his head, as an aid to reflection— Ive seen
several folks as I seem to know, but they don t
reckernise me. There was a woman uj> the road
as was cleanin’ her doorstep. I sez to er, Ain t
you Maggie Davis?’ but she guv a staie
at me. Rude ?my oath !—an’ then went in
an’ banged the door. Then there was a
man ridin’ a ’orse an’ leadin’ another, as 1
felt certain was a schoolfellow o mine.
*’ow are yer, Tom Perkins?’ I sez, but he only
sez, ‘Good day, mate’—civil enough, you under-
stand, but not reckernisin’ me—an rode on.
There was another woman, lead in two kicls to
school. So ’elp me never, I’ve kissed er ahun-
dred times when she were a gal. I stopped dead
in front of ’er, an’ dropped me swag, an sez
‘Mary ! ’ but she threw me a look fit to freeze up
an arteeshun bore, an’, afore I could say a word
to explain, hurried on. I might be a bloomin
Rip-Penny-Winkle, coinin’ ’ome after three years,
for all the reckernisin’l get.”
“Perhaps the hotelkeeper will know you, 1
suggested, and watched the effect of the remark.
“ No,” he said, with a laugh. “ Murphy would
’a’ reckernised me right enough, but e s dead, an
I don’t know the new bloke.
“ The policeman, of course, is new.
“Rather.” He laughed suggestively. Ibe
old one—Vs a sergeant now up Hamilton way, 1
think—would ’a reckernised me, I’ll take ray
bloomin’ oath, though we were never great pals,
’im an’ me. Through ’im I left the township—
leastways, it was through myself, you understand,
but me an’ ’im run up agen each other, an 1
cleared. Ah, them was lively times.
He was silent for awhile, and then, jerking his
head towards my canvas bag and camp-stool:
“Takin’ photos?”
“No,” I replied; “sketching.
“I’ll show you a pretty bit if you like, im
going along the creek to the cemetery. I want to
see where father and mother are buried. There s
a bend in the creek where we boys used to come
after ’possum and blaclcfish ; an’ there’s a big red
sandstone bank on t’other side where the swallows
used to build. Man, it is awful pretty, and Ive
often thought of it. If you want a good picture,
you can’t beat that spot. I’ve seen most o
Queensland, an’ a good part o’ the West, an New
South Wales since I left home, an’ have had a
look at some bits o’ scenery that folks would say
were fine—an’ so they were, I’m not denyin’ —but
somehow I always fancied they were nothing like
as pretty as that bend o’ the creek at home.
We were walking along the bank of the creek
as he spoke; for I liked his enthusiasm. I
wouldn’t mind givin’ a couple of bob for a photo
of that bend.” He looked at me as though wish-
ing me to understand that he was making a busi-
ness offer, and I had to assure him once more that
I was not a photographer. “Well, a picture o’
any sort would do,’’ he persisted. “ 111 give two
bob any day.”
He showed me the place. It certainly was a
beautiful corner, with its red sandstone bank
sloping down to a foreground of mossed rocks and
dainty ferns, shaded by silver gums most graceful
in form. I thanked him, and praised the place,
which pleased him. Then he went off to the
graveyard. ,
I stayed by the creek, sketching, reading,
dreaming, smoking, till the afternoon. T hen I
walked back to get a meal, when lo ! the first
thing I saw on approaching the hotel was my
friend of the morning coming out of it. He was
being shot beyond the bar door by the landlord,
who had one hand to his neck while the other
gripped the loose bulge of his trousers. He ca-tne
out with a great rush, arms snatching at vacancy,
legs sprawling east and west, eyes glaring, and
beer trickling down his chin. He and the land-
lord shouted together, the bar doors clattered as
they swung back, and in a moment the son of the
township was in the gutter.
He got up, swore, and shook his fist at the
hotel; after which he drew his torn shirt over his
uncovered mahogany chest and staggered down
the street. , . . , ,
A woman came out of a house behind me, ana
spoke to another woman who was walking along
with two children. Both women had witnessed
the unedifving incident. , , .
“Do you know who it is?” asked the woman
with the children. , , . . ..
“I do believe,” commenced the other, heavily
emphasising the “do.”
“Peter Callaghan come back, I m sure.
“Just what I was goin’ to say.”
“ The same old Peter ! ”
“ Same old Peter ! ”
A man rode along on a horse. Blest it ttiat
ain’t Peter Callaghan,” he said to the women.
We all watched him as he made his wav to the
bridge. Half-a-dozen men were by this time
sitting on the rail, smoking. Peter sparred up to
them. “Do ye reckernise me, ye dogs?” he cried;
“because if ye don’t” . He tapped one of
them on the chest, without any provocation.
“Same old Peter,” said the man on the horse.
The man who had been assailed sprang down
from the rail and grasped Peter. The wrestle
was only momentary. The returned native was
heaved into the air, over the railing, and into the
crcck.
Then the local constable, with whom the hotel-
keeper had communicated, came upon the scene.
Peter Callaghan scrambled up the bank a
drenched, miserable figure, but now compara-
tively sobered. ■, , _ „ ~
“Callaghan, my boy, Ive hearcj- of you, said
the policeman. . , „ .
“ Nobody reckernised me this mornm, he
gasped, while spitting the mud out of his mouth,
“but I meant this ere place to know I d come
back.” j .
“Is it a triumphant arch you wanted, with
‘ Welcome ’ on it in gold letters ? ” inquired the
constable. “Did you expect the brass band to
turn out to meet you?” Peter ignored the
sarcasm, and blew mud and grass out of his
nostrils. “I don’t want to lock you up, so the
best thing you can do is to clear out as soon as
you can. This place isn’t big enough for you,
Peter.”
“Well, all right, so long as they reckernise
me,” said the Native.

There is no doubt that if some beneficent being, with the power to grant our requests, were to
ask us to express our dearest wish and promise that it should be realised, nine out of every ten of us
would, without hesitation, elect to become millionaires. The other one-tenth, too, would be sorely
tempted to make a like choice, but would, probably, after severe mental conflict, conclude that a
million would be of little use without the capacity to enjoy the pleasures it would procure, and would
consequently decide that freedom from pain was the greatest boon they could ask. To the nine-tenths
nothing can be promised, but it is Within the power of a large proportion of the remaining tenth to
realise their desire, the sufferings of most of them being caused by 8
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Lumbago
Sciatica
Blood Disorders
Anaemia
Indigestion
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
and a radical cure in any of these cases can speedily be assured. One and all of the disorders specified
are but the effect of the failure of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
bo efficiently perform their functions. These important organs, when acting healthily, deal with
and remove from the system, the poisons which inflict the pain and sickness.
The Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce!
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either Weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous, and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, G nit, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Blad^ dei Troubles, and Brights Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition
of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and
let it stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust-like sediment, or if the
particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time
must be lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but
more painful illness will result.
The Liver.— ln the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood
converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood*
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived* their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion
Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache, and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
trie kidneys to be affected, and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys and
Liver was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure.
It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary to find a curative agent which
would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these organs being so immediately associated
in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and after many disappointments, the medicine
which possessed the required action in the fullest degree was at length discovered. Warner’s Safe
Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital
organs are enabled to rid the body, through the natural channels, of the urinary and biliary poisons
the presence of which, in the system are the cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Neuraigia, Lumbago, Back-
ache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and General Debility. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all these disorders simply
by removing the cause of the disorder. This is the reason why cures affected by Warner’s Safe Cure
are nermanent cures. [qgj
A Voice from the City.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On western plain and eastern hill*
Where once my fancy ranged,
The station-hands are riding still
And they are little changed.
But I have lost in London gloom
The glory of the day—
The grand perfume of wattle bloom
Is faint and far away.
Brown faces under broad-brimmed hats,
The grip of wiry hands,
The gallops on the frosty flats
Seem dreams of other lands.
The camp-fire, and the stars that blaze
Above the mystic plain,
Are but the thoughts of vanished days
That never come again.
The evening star I seldom view
That led me on to roam ;
I never see the morning star
That used to draw me home.
But I have often longed for day
To hide the few I see,
Because they only point and say
Most bitter things to me.
I Wear my life on pavement stones
That drag me ever down—
A paltry slave to little things
By custom chained to town*
I’ve lost the strength to strike alone,
The heart to do and dare;
I mind the days I’d roll my swag
And tramp to God-knows-Where.
When I should wait I wander out,
When I should go I bide ;
I scarcely dare to think about
The days when I could ride.
I would not mount before his eyes,
Straight bushrnan gaunt and tan—
I mind the day when I stood up
And fought him like a man.
I mind the time when I was shy
To meet the brown bush girls;
I’ve lunched with lords since then, and I
Have been at home with .earls.
I learned to smile, and learned to-bow,
And lie to ladies gay,
But to a gaunt bush-woman now
I’d not know what to say.
And if I sought her hard, bare home,
From scenes of show and sham,
I’d sit all ill at ease and feel
The poor, weak thing I am.
I could not meet her hopeless ey< s
That look me through and through—
The haggard woman of the past,
Who once thought I was true.
But nought on earth can last for aye,
And, wild with care and pain,
Some day by chance I’ll break away
And seek the bush again.
And find awhile from bitter tears
The rest the bush can bring.
And hear, perhaps, with truer ears
The songs it has to sing.

MR. JONES AT MARAETARA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Old Man read the telegram, and turned to
♦he Traffic Clerk in amazement.
‘ The Station-master,' Maraetara, has been
quite incapacitated by a badly-loaded truck of
firewood collapsing on him ; I never heard of such
a thing! ”
“ They do collapse sometimes, sir ! ”
He wants the Relieving Officer sent up at
once. Whom shall we send ? ”
Jones, I suppose ; he’s the best fighter on the
section.”
“The best fighter on the section ! What the
devil has that to do with running the station ? Is
this section a prize-ring, sir ? ” growled the new
Traffic Manager, with some asperity.
“Well, sir, the S.M. Maraetara is always a
fighting man ; the present officer in charge is
quite a pugilist. You see, sir, it’s a timber-
station, and the timber getters are very rough.
They never argue—they fight. At the end of the
month, when they are paid, two doctors and a
dispenser go up there for a week, and make
money.”
“Good heavens!—what savages ! ”
“They certainly are very rough, sir.”
“And this man Jones,” continued the Traffic
Manager, “is he a professional pug—does he
receive anything extra from the department for
being the boss bruiser of the section ? ”
“No ; but he’s a very good fighter, and many
of the professionals hereabouts decline to take him
on.”
“ H’m; to-day’s the 9th—he’ll probably arrive in
time for the tail-end of it. Perhaps you had
better notify Mr. Jones to stand by in readiness
to go to Maraetara.”
* ♦ * *
At 12.45 p m. the express steamed out of the
wilderness of fern trees, rimus and towering pines
into an open space of country where the bush was
visible only on three sides, while on the other the
view was bounded by a low line of hills with a
panorama of stream and lakelet lying between.
1 lie chrome-yellow railway buildings stood out in
bold relief in the foreground, and When the train
stopped Jones found himself at Maraetara.
Jhe scared-looking cadet, who shrank when
Jones spoke to him, led the way into the office,
and said the S.M. was in bed behind the letter-
rack and battery cupboard. Jones walked round,
and found a weird apparition gazing meditatively
at the fire with one eye, the bedclothes tucked
lghtly round his chin.
The apparition consisted mostly of sticking-
plaster, and had a large lump of steak fastened
over the right eye. It might have been a truck
tnat feu upon him, but he looked much more like
a man who had been fighting with three timber-
getters.
-The apparition explained that the truck of fire-
wood had. broken him all up.
A*’? you sure it wasn’t a bull kicked you ? ”
Said Mr. Jones, with a winning, affable expres-
sion.
The S.M. glared savagely out of the only eye he
could see with, and Mr. Jones went off to get the
express away.
* ♦ * *
Out in the crisp sunshine the bees were hunl-
ming; there was a scent of foliage, and a drowsy
stillness gave an atmosphere of heavenly calm to
the scene of frequent fights. Mr. Jones felt dis-
appointed So far, he hadn’t seen one warlike
individual. He began to think that Maraetara’s
reputation was bogus.
The landlord of the Railway Hotel was a mar-
vellously quiet man, and the few fellows lounging
around seemed anything but pugilistically in-
clined. After eating, Jones went to the smoking
room, and held a pleasant conversation with a
man in a blue shirt on the subject of timber-
getting.
The man in the blue shirt admitted screw-jacks
Were useful, but said they took up too much time
when Totara Jack was around. Totara Jack, he
explained, could shift any log, if there was some-
thing to plant his feet against, in which case he
just curled himself up between the log and the
stump of rock, straightened himself out, and then
either the log shifted or the other thing left the
ground.
Totara Jack, it was mentioned, was still in the
township, not having been able to tear himself
away from the charms of a woman who was badly
m love with him.
Mr. Jones determined to see this remarkable
man before he left Maraetara, and arranged for an
introduction. Then they had drinks, and Jones
went back to the station and received a bull-pup
valued at £65, consigned to the Hon. J. D. Break-
water, Rutaniwha. This valuable animal he
hooked by his chain to a bent nail in the wall.
A ballast train came in, and when the ganger
had got his time-table one of the men asked for
the afternoon off. The ganger was willing, and
the acting S.M. didn’t care a hang; so the train
went off, and the surface-man remained explaining
to J ones that he had reason to believe his wife
was receiving the attentions of a skunk known as
iotara Jack. He announced his intention of
wringing Jack’s neck.
“ But I thought Totara Jack was an abnormally
strong man—a dangerous man, in fact?”
“All skite ! He’s too muscle-bound to scrap.
111 fight him with one hand ; and I’ll out his
throat when I catch him talking to my missus
this afternoon ! ” And he ground his teeth with
rage.
“Well, if you’re going throat-cutting you don’t
leave this office.”
The surface-man breathed hard.
“I’ll be calm, boss; I will be calm!” he
repeated vehemently; “but, ’struth! I’ll kill Totara
Jack all the same. I’ll kill him calmly. I won’t
let my passions rise. ”
“ Shut up ! ” yelled Mr. Jones.
The man looked at the clock, and dived out of
the office. Hardly had he gone when a tall, hand-
some woman appeared at the parcel window and,
leering at the Relieving Officer, asked if the ballast
train had gone.
Being assured it had, she beamed on Jones, and
after ten minutes’ friendly conversation went off.
Mr. Jones watched her through the office
Window ; she was certainly a splendid animal,
and her regal walk fascinated him so that he
watched her till she disappeared among the
clematis-covered trees.
* * * *
The droning peace of the afternoon entered
Jones’s soul; he sat in front of the fire and read
a magazine. The little cadet was having an
afternoon off, the first since he joined the service,
for the S.M. sweated him dreadfully.
Suddenly the ears of Jones were offended by
horrible threats and blasphemy, shouted in tones
that travelled like the screech of a bull-Yankee
engine.
He got up hastily and through the window saw
the husband bounding towards the office at a
wonderful speed, and, yards behind, the biggest
man Mr. Jones had ever seen rushed along in
pursuit. The tall, handsome wife of the fettler
brought up the rear.
Mr. Jones chuckled.
The husband bounded into the office and begged
incoherently for protection.
“ Good Lord! I thought you’d have had his neck
wrung by this time ; but buck-up, man ! you and
I can surely lay him out; if we can’t we’ll get
Reid, the porter, to help us. and the three of us
ought to be able to eat him.”
. The husband responded to this stirring exhorta-
tion by scrambling into the battery cupboard
and lying down on top of the 70 odd jars of
rotting copper and zinc and putrid water. That
sort of electric battery doesn’t smell too nice at
any time, but when it’s disturbed !
Mr. Jones didn’t mind fighting a man a little
bigger than himself, but Totara Jack was not to
be thought of. So he locked the door and awaited
Jack at the parcel window.
‘“’Day, mister! ’’said Jack, civilly enough.
“’Day !” said Jones, shifting his cigar with his
left hand and knocking the ash off it with the
ruler in his right hand.
. “Pass out the bloke inside; I want to tear him
in three pieces,” said Jack in a confidential tone
of voice.
“ What for ? ” said Jones.
“ He’s chucked aspersions on his wife’s charac-
ter, a.n’ I won’t have it,” fiercely.
“ What are you to his wife—a relation ? ”
“Naw, but I’m not goiu’ to ’low that white-
livered sneak to take away her character.*’
“You’re quite right!” said Jones; “but I
don’t think I d better let you have him; you
might kill him and get yourself and the lady into
trouble.”
Look here, mister. Don’t you try to go for
to stop me. I’m goin’ to choke him with his own
words ; so just you pass him out, or I’ll come in
an’ take him. T can pull this yer buildin’ down
if I wants to—d’yer understand ”
‘Well, you’re not coming in here without a
fight, anyhow !”said Jones, savagely.
“Well, mister, if it’s fight yer lookin’ fer,
you’ve come to the right place to find it.”
Well, you’ll only get yourself into trouble,
and that’s what I want to keep you out of.**
“Your troubles about me !” said Totara Jack,
commencing to climb in through the parcel window
in a cold blooded, matter-of-fact way.
In just as cold-blooded and matter-of-fact
a manner Jones smote him across the head with
the black ruler, and he rolled off the parcel counter
on to the floor of the shelter-shed with his coun-
tenance badly broken.
He looked at Jones with a gloomy eye, while he
wiped the blood with his sleeve.
“That Was a, real ‘ wattle-snoozer,’ all right,
Mister! ” he said, in a tone that seemed to Jones
quite friendly ; “ but it’s no good ; I’m cornin’ in
fur that cove right now.”
The woman said nothing, only stood in a bent
position, with her hands between her knees,
intoxicated with delight at the sight of battle.
Totara Jack came with a rush, and Jones
swung up the heavy ruler, but Jack put his
hand On the counter and lightly vaulted in, feet
first. Before the charge of these mighty clay-
stampers Jones recoiled, and Jack landed on his
feet inside the office. But, before he could regain
his balance, Jones had seized him round the
knees and thrown him down on top of the bull-
pup, and that noble animal had bitten him twicb
before he had time to swear. As he sprang to his
feet he met the ruler once more, but Jones
missed the point for which lie had aimed, and
Totara Jack was saved from annihilation. He
staggered to his feet, and as he did so the bulldog
bit him again.
With something between a shriek and a shout
he kicked the dog heavily in the ribs and upset
him, and at the same moment he took a double
turn of the chain round his hand, and with one
mighty wrench tore the hook from the wall and
again dodged the black ruler. Then he assumed
the offensive. He swung the struggling bulldog
at the end of the chain, and lashed at Jones with
the animal.
Against this astounding weapon the black ruler
was useless. Jones side-stepped and ducked as he
had never done before, but it was all in vain. The
south end of the dog crashed down on his face and
chest, and sent him to the boards with a bang.
But he was up again in a flash, and once more
seizing Totara Jack by the knees tried to fling him
on to the stove.
Jack missed it, but the dog didn’t; though it
could have made no difference to him—if he wasn’t
dead he ought to have been. Jones rushed in to
finish thefight with thornier, butthedog smote him
heavily in the ribs and knocked him down, and
the boss fighter of the section realised he had met
a tougher man than ever before.
He tried to close with the giant once more, but
the long fellow shortened his stroke, and with a
blow over the head laid Jones right out.
Next minute a series of swears and howls,
accompanied by the crashing of much glass,
scared the bruised S.M. next door and sent his
wife into hysterics. Even Potter Reid at the far-
end of the platform, cleaning the main line points,
heard the crash of the battery as the intruder
dragged the injured husband out and spilt the
battery soup over the floor.
He banged the injured one with the dead dog,
and the husband rolled round the floor trying to
escape the blows, and was nearly drowned in the
soup. A playful mood came over the victorious
timber-getter, and finding three quart-bottles of
assorted inks he amused himself coloring the
injured husband in lurid half-tones. Then he
poured some over the face of Jones, and that
slogged-out individual opened his eyes, looked at
the dog, and tried to collect his thoughts.
Jack’s novel weapon tickled his fancy and he
regarded it critically as it made a dull, meaty
impact with the husband. That injured individual
was absolutely the noisiest man who was ever
walloped with the remains of a £65 bull dog, and
his yells roused Jones, who, with blood in his
eyes, suddenly scrambled to his feet, and to
Totara Jack’s amazement, attacked him at long
range with every portable thing he could lay
hands upon. The black ruler bounced off the
timber-getter’s head; ink bottles followed in
quick and unerring succession, and when Totara
Jack rushed at him Jones promptly fled round
the office and threw the furniture behind him.
Jack came down badly over the long, three-
legged stool which Jones tipped over right in
front of him.
Round and round the ofßce they went. He hit
Jones between the shoulders with the dog, and
Jones retaliated with the P 26 book in the eye.
The P 26 book was large, and the corners sharp,
and Jack dropped the dead pup and gripped his
eye with both hands. Like a flash Jones turned
and banged him heavily, knocking him against
the wall (the woman’s face, framed in hair like
burnished copper, now beamed at him through
the parcel window), but he was afraid to give
Jack a chance to get to close quarters. The
timber-getter renewed the chase, and the other
did more excellent foot-work. Reid, the rat-like
porter, scrambled in through the window, and
caught the giant round the legs. Jack tried to
slay him with one blow, but missed, and Jones
hit him 16 times almost simultaneously.
Suddenly Jack bounded about three feet into
the air and shook Reid off—that ferocious little
man had bitten him on the leg. Reid fled out of
the window again. The injured husband had
disappeared long since through the same orifice.
The <£G5 bulldog belonging to the Hon. J. D.
Breakwater was quite dead. The tall woman
cavorted up and down the platform in ecstasy.
Inside, Jones and the timber-Goliath again hustled
round the room at great speed.
Then a weak man of no account came and ended
the battle. The incapacitated S.M. crawled to
the window, looked round desperately for a gun,
or a brick, or some other weapon, then in despera-
tion took the steak off his eye and threw it feebly
at Jones’s enemy. Jack trod on the greasy sub-
stance, slid wildly across the room and came down
heavily. When he recovered a second or two
later, Jones was standing over him with a kettle
of boiling water, which the thoughtful porter had
handed in through the window.
“If you move,” said Jones, coldly, “I’ll spill
this on you.”
Jack said he was a peaceful man, and all he
wanted was complete rest. He even offered to
pay for the bulldog.

Mr. Wm. B. Mackie, of Dunedin, New
Zealand, sends us his photograph and
says:
“Not long ago I was run over by a
wagon and severely injured. For weeks
I was confined to my bed. I was reduced
to a mere shadow, so weak I could hardly
walk. The doctors told me it would be a
longtime before I could regain my health.
I felt I could not wait, so procured a
bottle of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. You can-
not imagine how quickly my health and
strength began to return. The first day
I felt an improvement. In a week I had
a better appetite, and was much stronger.
And only a few bottles wrought a most
marvelous change in me. I like your
medicine especially because it seems to
give just the aid nature sometimes
needs.”
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
If you have been sick and are not recovering rapidly, just try a bottle of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It is the strongest tonic* you can buy, and it aids nature
wonderfully. The better way is to take the Sarsaparilla before you get really
ill. Take it when you first begin to feel poorly. It will cure you quickly
then and save you much suffering and large expense. Yet even when you are
sick, you cannot find a better medicine.
There are many so-called Sarsaparillas. Be sure you get Ayer’s, the oldest,
strongest, and best Sarsaparilla. Don’t experiment with imitations.

“ Ami.” : Dan Barry made two great coups as a juvenile
newspaper man. He got out an extraordinary in Hobart
about the Russian bombardment of Adelaide, and another
ia Adelaide about the Russian bombardment of Hobart.
Also a Melbourne sensation, in a Sunday paper called
Gossir, about Ballarat caving in and entombing 400
people.
“Nar-Rooni” writes: The Australian girl may not be
able to capture London crowds by her singing, but she
seems to be fully able to capture the London press by
shaking the smallest grain of salt on its tail. “ M.A.P.”
of July 18 has a par which describes Miss Kate Rooney as
being “ a grand horsewoman, an excellent shot, a
champion swimmer, a splendid all-round athlete, and she
can throw a boomerang like a blackfellow.” Now I
have the pleasure of knowing Miss Rooney intimately,
and I can guarantee that she is a fairly good swimmer ;
but she had no athletic training, she never fired off any-
thing more deadly than a “ hunger,” and she can’t throw
a boomerang. I would be sorry to know a woman who
attempted such a thing. It wouldn’t be safe. The lovely
sex should practise first with a brick at a fowl. *
Hamlet” : “ L. 8.,” on Australian drama, among other
things, said that Australian managers would only be
willing to pay £5OO or £lOOO for a play equal to “ If I
Were King” and other such stuff if it were offered them
by an Australian. Would they? If a manager won’tread
your plays how is he to know whether they are good or
not? How often do our leading managers produce an
unknown play by an unheard-of author? Most of the
plays we see are those that have run successfully in Eng-
land and America. Our managers, as a rule, watch
London managers experimenting with new plays, and
those that are successful in England they buy up, and
produce on their London reputations.' Our leading
managers are doing practically nothing for our
Australian playwrights. The limited stock of
Australian drama we have is, for the greater part*
melodrama. Years ago The Bulletin stepped into
a long vacant position and assisted Australian litera-
ture; now the struggling Australian drama is
waiting and watching for a wealthy manager to feed it,
encourage it, and raise its tone. Despite "‘A Tired Aus-
tralian,” there is material around us to build comedies
upon—dramas, too, and, maybe, operas. Alfred Dampier,
who has done more for Australian drama than any other
manager, in an interview in Adelaide some months ago,
expressed the opinion that there was a great future ahead
of Australian drama, and a growing demand in England
for things typically Australian. If it were in Dampier’s
power, he would pay big prices for Australian workman-
ship of this class, but it is not. Still, he is doing his level
best for the cause, which is 100 per cent, more than our
bigger managers are doing.
Elizabeth Howard, from 40 to 30 years ago the greatest
of “circus queens,” and by many old hands reckoned the
most daring of all sawdust-performers, died a few weeks
back in New Orleans, where for years past she had been
a street paper-seller. She is said to have been the first
“star,” male or female, to tumble through paper hoops
while her horse was at full gallop.
Charles Cartwright, the actor with the mighty metallic
voice (of whom a Melbourne penwoman once wrote that
“he hasn’t a hair on his body”), is said to give a very
pathetic performance of Daniel Peggotty in the new
dramatisation of “David Copperfield.” Miss Agnes
Thomas plays the old maiden aunt, Betsy Trotwood, in
the same show. Time was when Agnes Thomas played
young girls in farcical comedy for the Firm, or smart
heroines in Bland Holt’s dramas. She came out to
Australia with Dion Boucicault the elder, and used to
capture the heart of Titheradge in “ The Shaughraun”
19 years ago, or thereabouts.
John Coleman, an older actor than Johnny “ Scare-
crow” Coleman, has been writing a book about the late
Charles Reade, in which appears a cold-blooded confession
of “ British fair-play ” as practised by one of the most
serious-minded of English dramatists and novelists.
Reade told Coleman the story of how he came to adapt
» The Ladies’ Battle ” from the French. He was in Paris
when the original was first played, and he stole it right
away. “No British brigands were present, so it occurred
to me as an inspiration to play the bandit myself.
Obtaining a copy of the play, I made way back with my
booty, and immediately set to work on the adaptation. I
am ashamed to say I never thought of paying Scribe or
LegouvA or even asking their permission to do the piece.
It was so customary then to steal from our neighbors.”
But when his own novel, “ It’s Never Too Late To Mend,’
was being pirated for stage purposes by the hack authors
of obscure theatres, Reade rushed to the law-courts and
started litigation, which ultimately settled the law of
dramatic copyright in his own country.
The last Charing Cross Hospital Gazette (London)
states that Margaret Howard, aged 76, a vagrant recently
treated there for an injured shoulder, claims to have
been once a leading lady in Henry Irving’s dramatic
company. It is believed that she is a well-known actress,
under a disguised name. Evidently a lady of education,
she was able to repeat long sketches of her theatrical
characters.
“ B.”: “Are You a Mason?” before it reached the
English stage, was a German farce. Traces of its Teutonic
origin are writ large upon the piece, for the German is as
good at writing farces as an elephant is at playing the
violin, or Bent at walking the tight-rope.
Labouchere was one of the members of the House of
Commons who proposed to bring stage children under
the Factories Act— i.e., abolish them altogether from the
profesh. Ultimately the minimum age of the stage kiddie
was fixed at 10' years, which is four years more than the
age of Ellen Terry when she played a fairy in “ Mid-
summer Night’s Dream.” A London paper, commenting
on Labouchere’s speech, hoped that his wife had some-
thing to say about it after he got home. Mrs. Labby—
nie Henrietta Hodson—started her stage career as a mere
baby, like Mrs. Kendal and most other actresses born of
theatrical parents.
A clairvoyant gave exhibitions of future-reading capaci-
ties in the Mechanics’ Institute of an up-country town, a few
weeks back, and answered queries with the usual facility
and accuracy. Amongst the members of the local Ranger
detachment were Corporal O’Toole and his hated rival for
military promotion, a wizened warrior named Smith.
O’Brien, who loved neither of them, wrote out a question,
“ When will O’Toole become a general?” and signed it
“Smith.” Question was read out from the stage,
but never answered. There was a roar like that of an
infuriated bull, a mad charge, a shout of “ What
the devil d’ye mane by axing that question, ye
crawlin’ cur?” then biff, biff, clench, roll, and a
wriggling mass of humanity surged towards the door, the
combatants locked in the centre of the knot. Ten
respectable citizens tore the farm-burners apart just in
time to save the empire from being torn to pieces
