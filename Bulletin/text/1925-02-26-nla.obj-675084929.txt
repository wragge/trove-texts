Really, that rutty, pot-holed road you have to travel need not have any terrors for you.
For many years engineers have
given much thought to devising
means of absorbing road
shocks, not only because of the
great discomfort they cause to
those riding in the car, but
because of the serious dan
that often results to the car
itself.

There have been and there are shock absorbers and shock absorbers, but it has remained for the manufacturers
of the world-renowned Stewart Speedometer to evolve a really efficient device that can be depended upon to
regularly absorb each and every shock—no matter how fast the shocks may come or how rough the road may
be—-without constantly needing attention itself, and frequent replacement of worn parts.

Dowell O’Reilly
Dowell O’Reilly wrote curiously little for
one who wrote so well. His verse is always
fresh, thoughtful and musical ; his prose lias
a quiet strength which occasionally touches
magic. The claim has been made for lum
that he is Australia’s best prose writer, but
the bulk of his achievement on the highest
plane is hardly sufficient to maintain this.
The Prose and Verse of Dowell O'Reilly
(Angus and Robertson, Sydney) contains
most of the work of permanent interest that
he gave to the world; though in the
preface by his old friend Justice Ferguson
there is ii promise of another volume con-
tairl-g a few essays and selections from his
letters. Those who remember the strength
the vigor of some of his correspondence iu
the press, as well as those wlm had the privi-
lege of closer intimacy, will look forward
to that book. ~ .
The sketch “Twilight,” which first ap-
peared three years or so back in Ihe Bul-
x.etin, has a quality of sympathy and tender-
ness which sets it in a place apart. Dowell
O’Reilly looked at the world with gentle,
kindly eyes. It might almost be said that
gentleness is the keynote of his writing.
Even his choice of word and phrase conveys
this feeling. Language is to him too soft
and sweet a tiling to touch harshly, though
he knows the value of contrasts and can occa-
sionally use the hard word with fine effect.
Nothing could more clearly show the out-
look of this weaver of delicate thought than
his quatrain on “Australia.” Others have
seen Australia as a prize, as a young queen,
as a home of wonder and mystery, but
Dowell O’Reilly put everything in a softer
setting:—
When Nature’s heart was young and wild,
She bore in secret a love-child,
And weeping, laughed—too glad to dress
Its lawless, naked loveliness.
Of himself he wrote: “I have published less
than any Australian writer of my age, but
I think I have followed the pale glimpses
of my star.” How near he sometimes got
to a full vision of that star his readers of
the future will best judge. The one thing
that is certain is that his place will be far
higher than the meagre quantity of his work
might suggest.
D. M. W.
Shakspearcana in 1924
During the past year there have been some
noteworthy additions to that colossal super-
structure which scholarship and perversity
have erected over the dramatic works gath-
ered together for the first time in the Folio
of 1623, and therein credited to William
Shakspeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon. So
amazing is this edifice that we realise very
thankfully the delight which can still be
found by the simple and uncritical in the
plays themselves. At the same time it is
good for the world to have emerged from
that fawning adulation of everything con-
tained in the First Folio which character-
ised the latter part of the eighteenth and
the beginning of the nineteenth century.
One of the most indefatigable of English
writers upon the problems of authorship in-
herent in many of the plays is Mr. John M.
Robertson. In 1922 he published the first
part of “The Shakspeare Canon,” dealing
with the origination of “Henry V.,” and of
“Julius Cmsar,” and the authorship of “Rich-
ard III.” In 3923 he published Part 11. of
the same work, dealing with the authorship
of “The Two Gentlemen of Verona,” “Rich-
ard II.,” “The Comedy of Errors” and the
problem of “Measure for Measure.” There
lias just reached Australia “An Introduction
to the Study of the Shakspeare Canon, pro-
ceeding on the Problem of Titus Androni-
cus.” In these last three works Mr. Robert-
son attacks the traditional canon of the
plays ascribed to Shakspeare. No doubt it
seems like rank heresy to deny the oft-
asserted authenticity of “Henry V.,” but Mr.
Robertson’s careful survey of the non-Shaks-
pearean elements in the vocabulary and
phraseology shows the presence of Marlowe,
Green, Peele and Chapman in the patchwork
composition of this chronicle drama without
anything more than a perfunctory handling
by Shakspeare. It is also startling to the
orthodox to find Clarence’s Dream in Act 1.
Sc. 4 of “Richard III.” assigned to Marlowe.
Most of us shrink from the savage melo-
drama of “Titus Andronicus.” Its theme
is bestial revenge, and it is full of horrors.
“Shakspeare,” says Masefield, “certainly
never touched this job for love.” It is the
most coarsely repulsive play in the entire
Elizabethan drama. In the “Cambridge His-
tory of English Diterature,” however, Pro-
fessor Saintsbury declares the play _ to be
Shakspeare’s on the ground that “it was
acted and published in 1594, mentioned by
Francis Meares as Shakspeare’s in 1598, and
included in the First Folio.” On the other
hand, the play was rejected by Dr. Johnson,
and even by Coleridge. Ilaziitt excluded it
from the canon without reservation, deciding
that the external evidence was over-ruled by
the internal. Professor Raleigh came to
the conclusion upon the external evidence
that Titus Is a work of Shakspeare’s “youth-
ful bravadd.” Professor MacCallum pro-
nounced that “the flame-tipped welter of
‘Titus Andronicus,’ the poignant radiance
of ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ belong to Shaks-
peare’s pupilage and youth.” After devot-
ing 477 pages to the problem, Mr. Robertson
comes to the conclusion that the external
evidence is inconclu'sive and the circumstan-
tial evidence strongly contradicts that of the
literary record. The existing play seems to
have been in the possession of a theatrical
company with which Shakspeare had no
known connection. The play was, moreover,
published three times during the poett’s life-
time without his name. It is demonstrated
by comparative evidence that much of “Titus
Andronicus” was written by Peele, and it is
hardly less certain that much of the rest was
the work of Greene and Kyd, with some of
Marlowe.
We shall all be only too ready to find the
soul of Shakspeare assoiled from the artistic
crime of “Titus Andronicus.” In spite of
the inclusion of the play in the First Folio
it is almost incredible that the sensitive
poetic nature that conceived and penned the
exquisite poetry of “Romeo and Juliet and
the fairy imagery of “A Midsummer Nights
Dream,” could have been guilty of the vulgar
physical horrors of Titus, in which tne
power exercised by the poet bears no pro-
portion,” as Hazlitt says, “to the repug-
nance excited by the subject.” .
Mr. Robertson’s methods are familiar to
scholars. They are those of “the higher
criticism” applied to secular literature, and
consist of a criticism of the plots and char-
acters, aesthetic appreciation .of the poetry,
measurement of the versification, the careful
consideration of double endings _ and un-
stopped lines, vocabulary, style, history and
comparison with the works of other Eliza-
bethans, We come from a perusal of his
books with a clearer vision of the process of
community play-making in the Elizabethan
theatre, where the rules of copyright were
vague, and the property in a play was vested
in a company, or in a theatrical entrepre-
neur, like Henslowe, rather than in an indi-
vidual playwright. It is clear that dramas
were written, rewritten and patched by
single authors, or by two or more in colla-
boration, and that a number of the works
in the First Folio were included therein by
its editors for other reasons than the authen-
tic nature of their authorship by William
Shakspeare. This view is better than the
Baconian heresy, or the fanciful strainings
of Looney and Abel Lefranc, because it is
founded by a process of induction upon the
ascertained facts. It gives us material aid
in understanding many of the problems in
the plays. It is, moreover, not new, for there
is a general admission that the first part
of “Henry V 1.,” and most of the second and
third parts, are not by Shakspeare. Add
to this the further admission that Henry
VIII.” is in great part from the pen of John
Fletcher, although all these were included
in the First Folio by Messrs. Helpings and
Condell, and the process of disintegration
has begun. The process may be distasteful
to the more conservative school, but it helps
us to see the man in closer relationship with
liis contemporaries and his theatre.
In her book, “The Women in Shakspeare s
Plays,” published last year, Miss Mure Mac-
kenzie has given a very fresh series of char-
acter studies. She is determined to look at
Shakspeare’s women not through the eyes
of man, but as a woman of to-dsly must look
at them. She is fully conscious of the
powers and duties of her sex, knows the
latest psychology, and has produced a book
full of humor and plain-speaking. The
studies she presents make no pretensions at
finality, for she realises that every genera-
tion has its own way of interpreting a work
of art. She observes that the dramatist was
interested not in abstract principles or the
sweeping generalities that pass for them, but
in the living people lie met, and, being a
dramatist, in the action that revealed them.
Her treatment of the subject differs from
that of Mrs. Jameson and of the great
actress, Miss Helena Faucit. In the nine-
teenth century, as in the eighteenth, the
opinions of women upon themselves were
derived in the main, not from their own
direct observations, but from the attitude
of the opposite and more articulate sex.
Miss Mackenzie observes the development of
the dramatist’s treatment of the women of
his plays. In the early works the women
are not unimportant, but their main in-
terest is as supplying motives for the action
of their men. In the progress of his art
Shakspeare individualised his women. Portia
in “The Merchant” stands out above any one
of her predecessors except Juliet. Her com-
bination of frank and generous feeling with
clear, shrewd wit makes her almost a Mere-
dithian woman. “But,” says Miss Macken-
zie, “she had no business to be consumed
with admiration of Bassanio —he is rather
a housemaid’s hero.”
The controversy upon “Shakspeare’s Hand
in the Play of Sir Thomas More” still rages.
In a book containing a series of papers and
studies by eminent scholars published in
1923, the subject was fully treated from the
point of view of style, matter and versifica-
tion ; moreover, Sir E. M. Thompson, one of
the foremost authorities on all subjects con-
nected with palaeography, directs his atten-
tion to the handwriting of certain passages
which, in his opinion, corresponds in all re-
spects with the hand of the known Shaks-
peare signatures. This is a discovery with
a most important bearing upon the question
of authorship. An attack upon it has been
delivered by Sir Geprge Greenwood, who. is
the champion of the theory that not the im-
mortal William of Stratford but some “great
unknown,” was the author. And so the
battle of scholarship, special pleading and
literary perversity is waged and “the Shaks-
peare section of the British Museum Cata-
logue oppresses the mind like the conception
of Eternity, only so much df it is not
eternal.”

What is English?
We all know oui* own language so thor-
oughly that it really is difficult to refrain
from dogmatising whenever we happen to
discuss it —especially when we discuss its
pronunciation. The French people have long
since recognised that it is not the province
of every Tom, Dick or Harry to determine
the right and the wrong in matters of lan-
guage. They have formed an Aca-
demy, not to lay down laws in advance
about the development of the language,
but to follow this development up, to
observe its progress and foster its spirit, to
standardise those modes of speech which are
in harmony with its genius, and which, by
a natural course, have come into usage.
Standard French is a definite thing; but
what is Standard English? Walter Ripman,
in his book, “Good Speech,” defines it as “a
form of the spoken language that contains
nothing that would jar on the ear of an edu-
cated speaker of southern English.” This
is something definite indeed! Who shall say
which pronunciation of a word is correct,
and which is not? Apart from the pronun-
ciation, who shall decide for us which words

Before the ranks of Rome."
Thus does Macaulay recall for us the
famous legend of Castor and Pollux with
their snow-white steeds.
Not on the battlefields of Roman legend,
but on the bottles of a famous Whisky do
we find the great White Horses of to-day.
For the White Horse has ever been the emblem of purity, strength,
courage and all the enduring qualities appreciated through every age.

have crossed the slang border-line? It is
nobody’s business, and so we all have a nnger
in the pie, and, upon my word, we do make
a Babel of it. . ,
Before attempting a genuine discussion ot
English pronunciation, one must have a thor-
ough knowledge of the comparative
phonetics both of the sister Germanic lan-
guages and of such of the Romance languages
as have influenced its development.
William Clowes, in his article, “The Origin
of Dialects” (R.P. 29/l/’25). attacks a cer-
tain pronunciation of those words in Eng-
lish which begin with the consonant group
,eh. He represents this pronunciation by
the letters phw. It is somewhat doubtful
what he wishes to indicate by these letters.
If he intends them to represent the unvoiced
labio-dental consonant, closely resembling f,
that is often used by uneducated Irishmen,
we must agree with him that they do not
represent standard English. But one scarcely
fears the spreading of an epidemic of
this pronunciation. On reading further, how-
ever, one has the suspicion that it is not
this labio-dental consonant he is condemn-
ing, but the bi-labial which is the unvoiced
counterpart of the sound represented phoneti-
cally by the letter w! lie would make no
difference, then, between the pronunciation
of “which” and that of “witch”! Certainly
the present-day spelling is misleading, in that
the h, which is intended to stand for the un-
voiced bi-labial consonant, follows the voiced
u\ instead of preceding it. The older spell-
ing of this class of words was more accurate
in this respect. For example, the modern
word “when” was formerly spelt “hwanne.”
There is no doubt that educated speakers of
southern English use this unvoiced bi-labial
before the voiced w in the wh words, and
there is no reason why we in Australia
should not conform with the standard in this
instance.
We must remember, when wo feel tempted
to dogmatise about our language, that, intro-
spection is a trustworthy guide only to a
certain degree; it must be heavily seasoned
with judicious observation of the practice
of others in their speech. Since we do not
seem to realise that the establishment of a
body similar to the French Academy is a
necessary thing for the welfare of the Eng-
lish language, and an institution of vital
importance to every one of us, let ns at least
be wary in our choice and acceptance of
authorities. It is contrary to the spirit of
language that its rules should be laid down
by the individual; it is contrary to its in-
terests that they should be laid down by
the mob. Let us emancipate our English
language, then, from these two evils ; nowa-
days it is the most pliant and supple lan-
guage of all, but at its present stage of de-
velopment it needs careful handling. There
is nothing else for it —we must have an Aca-
demy. Our tongue will then be more uni-
' ersally recognised as a national possession.
The whole of the British Empire will have
n definite standard, and perhaps Australia
will be prevented from following in America’s
footsteps. To speak Australian must not be
our ideal; we must remember that our lan-
guage is English.
I. A. H.
Henley, Journalist and Editor
If one only had the room for them there
would be no more pleasant possession than
sets of old periodicals. There is always an
excitement in coming on some well-known
masterpiece just as it first stood out in print,
as. for instance, Swinburne’s “Ballade of
Dreamland,” that pearl of English ballads,
in Miss Braddon’s “Belgravia.” Sometimes,
indeed, one must go to the original publica-
tion if one is really to understand and enjoy,
say, such things as Thackeray’s “Round-
about Papers,” which I have come to know
only since I picked up the early Cornhills ;
there they were filling the place for which
they were meant.
The two stately volumes I am turning over
now are not indeed perfect. Whole numbers
are missing, and many a number has been
gutted; for my collection, after all, is only
tlie debris of a Sydney newspaper office.
Still, such as it is, it is precious: William
Ernest Henley’s National Observer for
those most interesting years 1892 and 1893.
For over ten years Henley, as he tells us,
had to sink the poet in the journalist, and
his “Views and Reviews” ai’e confessedly
rakings among the “shot rubbish” of that
time. He had been editor of the Magazine
of Art, but it was the (originally Scots)
Observer that first gave him the chance he
wanted to get his hand on contemporary
literature in the making and leave an impress
on the younger men. One can see him at
work, and enjoying it. He was wisely gen-
erous in opening his doors; there is a rare
and various feast in each number, and litera-
ture has justified him. But his impress on
his young men, now a vanished thing, was
not good. The variety of the journal is
regularly in danger of being annulled by
the most exasperating of all monotonies —the
monotony of a forced brilliance, a strained
“bravery,” to use a pet term of Henley’s
own. And then the extraordinary jargon
which he foists, when he can, on his con-
tributors—the hand of Henley in nearly all
the “copy.” Be it an admiral writing on
his own technical subject or a simple cor-
respondent venturing his private word, both
must write “I trow not.” “Prefer before,
preferable before, preference before,” that is
your style. Never say “he himself” ; use “him-
self” as subject. Best of all is it if you can
get off “Himself hath said it.” Most amaz-
ing is the rule enforced on all but the sign-
ing contributors that “if” shall never be
followed by the_ indicative; and so you get
“if he be, if he have, if he do” in quite im-
possible senses. It was soon observed that
in Henley’s verse there was a trace of An-
cient Pistol, and the “bravery” of his prose
ran down, at the last, into truculence and
swashbuckling.
His next adventure, as editor, was the
New Review, and that ran out after the
Diamond Jubilee. Then, in his retirement,
the Pall Mall Magazine gave him its “Ex
Libris” section to do with as he pleased.
My set, there again, is not perfect; for I
remember discarding a few early numbers as
purely ephemeral; but there is more pre-
served than most people own. Tittle of all
this “shot rubbish” has been allowed into
his collected works ; for here, in letters, life
and politics, Henley lets himself run not to
the extent of becoming at times, as Chester-
ton puts it. a mere rowdy. It is not so
much the notorious Stevenson article, miracle
of tale-telling out of school as is that
same. It is the lettered vulgarity of the
true-blue Byronian, noisily roaring down the
whole nineteenth century to exalt his hero as
man, artist and man of letters : calling Ros-
setti’s “Nuptial Sleep’’ a “cold, bald, peer-
ing statement’’ and Morris's “Rapunzel’
“rubbish”; damning Rossetti for an “ama-
teur” and solemnly dropping his hat, like
Corporal Trim, on the P.R.B. “in the full
belief that it covers them, all and sundry,
originals and derivatives, John Tapper and
tlie late Sir Edward .Tones." Even so, D. S.
Mac Coll had to rebuke him for letting his
anti-Ruskinism ride him so far as “to make
a mudpie of Turner's sexual affairs .on the
doorstep of a notice of Turner’s art.”
It is better to forget his divagations into
politics. The course of Ilenley well exem-
plifies the late days and ending of Victorian-
ism ; the last decade opening, as Mr. Strachey
tells us, w r ith a solid splendor never before
matched, and closing with a cynically squalid
filibustering adventure and a scandalous
revelation of incompetence—we lived un-
easily ever after till the earth split. Of
Henley’s part in that brawl one prefers to
remember just one set of verses that was
not unworthy—at least. Rupert Brooke
found it a good quarry for one of his 1914
sonnets —“The East Post.” Contrast Mr.
Kipling, that greatest of all Henley’s “young
men”: how loud his banjo and tambourine
in 1899. how flat his trumpet in 1914! With
all his faults I stick to my Ilenley, and know
how to find the quiet singer and delicate
artist, behind the Pistol. He is a craftsman
on the small scale, and for that reason he
reads best in the dainty little editions of
80 years ago. I wish they had not dressed
him in the “Collected Works” library style.

Race Origins
The Social and Political Systems of Cen-
tral Polynesia (3 vols.), by R. W. William-
son, M.Sc. (Cambridge University Press),
sorts the evidence of travellers, beach-
combers, missionaries and officials. Only
just in time. Everything is sinking into
myth in those lovely islands whose inhabi-
tants are dwindling, not, as has been thought,
because they were a soft and gentle race
and Western civilisation was too harsh and
rude, but because the crude old social observ-
ances which kept the tribes alert and active
have been ameliorated by Western humani-
tarianism. One reads that in Raratonga the
constitutional unit was the family, and the
family system gave a refuge to all and pre-
vented pauperism; but this family commu-
nism also killed energy and enterprise, and
while it lasted no material progress could
be expected. A custom of other islands,
which every conscientious Government official
would feel obliged to suppress, of claiming
the firstfruits of all the crops for the chief’s
son for a fixed period, is thus seen to be a
valuable measure for teaching the people to
produce above immediate needs. Mission-
aries usually regard taboo as a kind of
dangerous heresy; yet it was constantly used
by the chiefs as an instrument of real states-
manship. Thus the taboo was placed on cocoa-
nut-trees until they had matured; famine
was averted by tabooing certain sources of
food supply when shortage threatened;
there was the germ of a League of Nations
in the taboo on fighting at certain seasons
and in particular areas. The method served
so well that on islands which modern spoon-
feeding is rapidly depeopling, population out-
grew means of subsistence so frequently that
a portion of the community was regularly
slaughtered to redress the balance.
The sifting of the evidence relating to
early origins leaves it fairly certain that war
drove the islanders’ ancestors out of India—
Great-Atia-covered-with-rice —about 450 B.c.
They came via the Straits of Malacca and
Java, carrying a memory of stone-walled
temples with them, and leaving remnants
of their people here and there. They con-
quered or expelled a Papuan race inhabit-
ing the Asiatic archipelago, who also came
from India, and they sojourned in Indonesia
for three or four centuries until the Malays,
arriving via Sumatra and Java, pushed them
on. Shoved from behind and resisted in
front, they sought the line of least resistance
towards the south-east until they reached
the romantic islands where the first Euro-
peans found them some 1500 years later.
They were grand navigators, these brown
Vikings. “Men’s Bones Were the Wood of
That Canoe,” was the name of one of their
flagships; and its keel was called “Atea’s
Bones.” Like good seamen they kept logs,
and it is from a comparison of these logs,
still orally preserved in the native chants,
that their migrations have been traced. In
one set ef voyages they visited 31 islands,
many of which have been identified, and
the recital finishes with the statement:
“Others remain ; the greater part is not writ-
ten.” One wonders whether farther research
will connect them with the Aryan invaders
of India 7 and thus establish them as blood
brothers of another celebrated small-boat
navigator of those seas who was later Gover-
nor of N. S. Wales —Captain Bligh.
M. G. S.
Novels and Readers
ALAN D. MICKLE.
A- man to get pleasure out of the reading
of a work of fiction must be able to, as it
were, slip himself, his real self or an
imagined self, inside the skin of the hei - o of
the work and be, whilst he reads, that hero.
That hero must be what the reader is or
what he would greatly like to be. There are
two main classes of such works —the works
wherein the authors’ real selves are de-
scribed, and those wherein are described the
authors’ dream selves. The first works are
introspective, psychological, philosophical.
They describe their authors’ experiences and
ideas. The second works are works of
romance. They are more or less truthful
descriptions of the imagined selves their
authors would like to be real. To make a
demand for these two classes of works there
are two classes of readers. The man who is
given to living inwardly must live to quite a
large extent outwardly too. But the man
who lives outwardly need not live to any
great extent inwardly. That is to say, the
introspective thinker must act to live. He
must walk and talk and work and eat food.
But the man of action need not necessarily
do any introspective thinking at all. The
man who looks within must look without
too. The man who looks without need not
look within. The first man will probably be
able to take pleasure from the reading of
both classes of works referred to above,
whilst for the second man the first class of
books will be practically meaningless and the
reading of them will give him no pleasure at
all.
A man's life from his birth to his death
would seem to be one long quest for himself.
He wants to find out what he is, and to give
a lasting expression in some form or other
to what he finds out. He looks into his
experience-history to discover what Ik; really
is. There he is described in the effect of
things upon him. Or he looks into his imagi-
nation, seeking the self described in the
effect he would like to have upon things. So
he is more or less aware of two selves, his
real self and his dream self. If he is an
inward-living man he will have a more or
less definite idea of these two selves. He
will examine his motives and emotions and
be able to see fairly clearly his real self,
and he will bo able to form a fairly definite
imaginative self. He will be quite good at
dreams. And the two selves lie knows he
will bring to all the works of fiction he
reads. He will come looking for that which
his real self will fit into, or for that which
will be quite in keeping with the self of his
dreams. He will read, with the responsive
recognition-thrill that is the pleasure one
takes from appreciated art in all forms, works
like Turgeneff’s novels, Tchekhof’s plays,
Shakspeare’s “Hamlet” and “Macbeth.” Also
with a like pleasure he will read works like
“The Three Musketeers,” “Robbery Under
Arms,” “Lorna Doonc.” For him, too, is
all the vast array of fictional works that
come between these two extremes.
The outward-living man, the man of action,
on the other hand, is, as a rule, only awmre
of one self. His inward self is to him more
or less a blank. If some painful experience
docs drive him at any time to look within,
lie sees only wdiat is dark, confused, indefi-
nite. He has, therefore, nothing to bring as
a comparison-standard to tin' reading of
introspective, psychological. philosophical
works. So he does not read such works and
cannot possibly understand them if lie does.
He does not express himself in thought: he
seeks himself, not in books, but in life. He
is not, therefore, driven to reading books as
is the inward-living man: he is called to
reading them. He reads purely for the
pleasurable excitement he gets out of read-
ing. and his dream-self —never so clear and
defined as is the first man's—must always
be in the book. There must be love, and
excitement, and, above all, action. These
he can understand. He finds the self he
seeks, and can recognise that self expressed
in terms of these. But introspection and
psychology are something beyond his experi-
ence, something for which there is within
him no definite demand.
The vast majority of people are, of course,
neither wholly inward-living nor wholly out-
ward-living, and the vast majority of works
of fiction are neither wholly introspective
nor wholly imaginative. But a strange
thing about them is that, whereas the first
class of works, wherein the reader seeks lus
real self, must be true to the reader’s own
experiences, the second class, wherein the
reader seeks an imagined self, must be quite
outside those experiences. The introspective
man, for instance, reading one of Turgeneff’s
novels, says to himself: “How true that is .
I have experienced that.” But when he
reads “Robbery Under Arms” he does not
say, “How true that is!” It is all some-
thing outside his experience. So it may be
true. If he has had experience of criminals
he will know that most likely it is not true.
But if he has had no such experience the
illusion will endure. It wall be found to be
the same with all imaginative works and
their readers. That is why imaginative
works in the main describe the unfamiliar
and non-intimate. Their scenes are usually
laid where the reader has never been, and
deal with a class of people and events that
lie really knows very little about. That is
why places like the Pacific islands and the
Wild West of America make such fine set-
tings for imaginative talcs, and why man-
sions and hovels are more often used to
house the characters than those suburban
cottages where the great majority of readers
live. All that is necessary is a more or less
crude framework bearing a semblance of
reality about which the author can weave
the fascinating stuff of liis dreams.
The modern work of fiction is the direct
descendant of the ancient saga. The first
saga sang only deeds. Later sagas sang
deeds and also what led up to and away
from the deeds. Down these lines the saga
has travelled and developed until the modern
imaginative novel comes into being. And
in the earliest descriptions of what led up
to and away from the deeds in the sagas
is rooted the work of fiction that describes
not deeds so much as feelings, emotions,
mind-states, experiences, ideas. There the
modern introspective, psychological, philoso-
phical novel was born.
“Bio”: I have always hart the greatest respect for
Arthur Lynch, but the casuistry of his arguments in
reply to my par. (R.P. 9/10/’24) will certainly not
add to my esteem. The point I raised was one of
simple fact. I said that Australia was not neutral
in the Boer War of 1899, and, incidentally, that
Lynch, in fighting with the Boers, fought against his
fellow-countrymen. These are matters of fact, and
all Lynch’s heroics about the causes of che struggle,
his own doings and sufferings and Australian
democracy and fair-play, are like the flowers that,
bloom in the Spring, and I’m quite content to let
The Bulletin and its readers judge between us.
But as Lynch repeats his statement that Australia as
a State -was not implicated, I reply that even now
the Commonwealth cannot be legally neutral when
the King is at war, and actually the States were
just as much embroiled in 1899 as in 1914.
Finally, I can tell Lynch that if he wasn’t flghtirg
against the Australians they were certainly fighting
against him, and in their then mood he did well to
escape capture by them.

Cleveland Six Record
24 minutes, 47.04
seconds
Previous record-
-25 minutes, 48.85
seconds
Ralph Mulford Stat
“In making the world’s record on Mt. Wilson,
the Cleveland Six Mileage motor never failed to
answer the throttle.
“I had more power than I could use in most
places.
“The treacherous hairpin turns controlled the
car’s speed.”
You Can’t Find a Better Motor Car
Performance has become the basic criterion of
motor car value, because it is the outward manifesta-
tion of design, material and workmanship. That’s
why you can’t find a better car than the Cleveland
Six. Its most recent achievements on the famous test
climbs of California and in a National Economy Run
substantiate this claim.
Mount Wilson in the world’s record time of 24 min,
utes, 47.04 seconds!
Mount Diablo in the world’s record time of 22 min-
utes, 36 3-5 seconds!
Mount Baldy in the world’s record time of 14 min,
utes, 31 3-5 seconds!
In a 48 hour non-stop run, 86 Cleveland cars averaged
1565 miles per car, with a grand average gasoline
consumption of a gallon to every 21.4 miles. That’s
economy!
The 1925 Cleveland Six will do better than 40 miles
an hour in second gear; better than 60 miles an
hour in high gear; and accelerate from 5 to 25
miles an hour in less than seven seconds! And it has
a longer wheelbase, larger motor, and is sturdier
built than most of the medium priced sixes.
•
You should by all means see and ride in the 1925
Cleveland Six. It is sweeping the country!

Compare the motor car of
twenty-five years ago with
the motor car of today.
The engineering, research
and manufacturing staffs
of General Motors include
many of the men who have
contributed most to the
development of automo-
tive transportation.
What makes motor car value?
2. Experience
the best teacher.
So General Motors, by uniting
many long established automotive
companies into a family, makes the
experience of each one available to
the others.
For example: Oldsmobile was
the first commercially successful
motor car. Cadillac was first to be
completely electrically equipped and
tohaveinterchangeableparts. Buick
gave the overhead valve engine.
Oakland was the first light six.
Chevrolet combined the features of
expensive cars with low price.
Each car division, a pioneer in
motor car development, contributes
its specialized experience to the
rest. And to this wealth of experi-
ence General Motors adds that of
a score of other divisions producing
parts, accessories and equipment.
• ♦ ♦ ♦
Thus when you buy a General Mo-
tors car or truck, you profit by the
experience of the division which
builds it, plus the accumulated
knowledge of the family of which
it is a part.

Alien Things.
On hill and river reach the breeze
Expires, its wayward spirit spent;
Smoke-wreaths among the stirless trees
Still hint of vanished merriment.
A feather here, and there a reed,
Upon the greying river floats;
No ripples, gleaming as they speed,
Run shoreward now from dancing boats.
With hushing hand and muted tongue
Grave Quiet walks by slope and shore;
The last of all the birds has sung
His farewell song, and sings no more.
And yet, though silenced is the lute
Of Joy the Minstrel, sped his tune,
And all is songless, grave and mute,
The bending trees and hills commune.
Tall hills and gum-trees, gaunt and grey,
Lit wanly by day’s afterglow—
I think in some mysterious way
They talk of things no man may know.
The river, too, for all its calm,
For all its stillness talks, I think,
In wordless speech to fern and palm,
That droop their fronds above its brink.
Deep gloom on hill and hollow falls,
Night enters on his vast estate,
Leaves circle down, a mopoke calls,
And calls afar his waking mate.
Dusk gathers, still and deep and tense;
An owl flies by on noiseless wings:
Too weird is all! I must haste hence —
Haste straightway from these alien things.

Sonnet.
If it be true that there are no pipes left
For poets who would sing these bitter
days,
If flute and lute and harp that pulsed old
lays
Now sing no more the pangs of love bereft—
The sting of Spring and lips of maidens deft
And dainty in their old-world gracious
ways—
Then wild Regret her secret zither plays
And Music with her own discords is cleft.
If this be true and song no more knows fire,
Yet must I seek my lost pipe in the grass,
My lute in the lone wind and still, with
trust,
Rustle the throbbing leaves for my lost lyre.
I know my song, my dreams, myself must
pass;
But I have heard my soul breathe under dust.

Vagabond.
Ever the call of the open sky
And the lure of the flying foam.
The glimpse of a seabird sweeping by,
Wheeling into the sunlight high,
Skipping the wave with a glancing wing,
While bird and wave and spindrift sing:
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Linger here
While the morn is sweet!
Never for you the seething town
Nor the dust of the street.
Lay by your stick, your pack set down,
Rest on the long sands, warm and brown,
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Heed the call
While the morn is sweet!
Follow and follow the unknown road.
Winding into the west,
Beauty and mystery are the goad
Of him who carries a weary load,
Drinking the fragrance of hawthorn bloom
Blent with the scent of the upland broom.
Vagabond! Vagabond !
Slowly tread
Under the noon’s white sky.
Here where the willows shade the stream
And the golden trout drift by
Throw down your pack and idly dream,
Watching the water’s fitful gleam.
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Life is sweet,
Under the noon’s white sky.
Ever the lure of the forest way
And the liquid note of a bird
In the green gloaming softly stray,
Where timid things of the woodland play,
Little brown mice in the rustling grass,
Tawny rabbits to watch you pass.
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Hear the sough
Of the wind in the swaying trees.
Nesting birds in the branches croon,
Rocked by each wandering breeze;
Till the long shadows of afternoon
Steal through the fields in their dusky shoon.
V agabond! Vagabond!
Listen long
To the wind in the forest trees!
Follow and follow the mountain track
Leading on to the stars;
Take not heed of your drooping pack
Or the echoing gorges lone and black.
Somewhere under a sheltering crag
You shall rest when your footsteps flag.
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Light your fire
Here on the mountain height.
Down on the plainland far below,
Faint in the haze of night,
Clustering lights of the city glow;
But the friendly stars are the lamps you
know.
Vagabond! Vagabond!
Heaven’s at hand
Here on the windy height.

THE PROSPECTUS OF BOLSH AND
CO., UNLIMITED.
The Australian Communist party, which
proposes to make a bigger effort than usual
to win seats at future elections, and which
considers, possibly with reason, that its pros-
pects are brightening, has issued its list of
promises in order to attract the “proletarian”
elector. No land-sale or mining prospectus
was ever more garish. And its sponsors con-
template one notable advantage for it above
the common or stereotyped programme. If
once accepted by, or imposed on, Australia
it isn’t intended that any future expression
of hostile opinion at the polls shall shift it
and those who run it and live by it. All
the people whose hostility might be confi-
dently reckoned on will be eliminated under
the “working-class dictatorship,” and the
working class, being itself dictated to by
the organised forces of its nominal leaders,
and its vote scrutinised and supervised by
them, won’t count for much either. In fact, the
proposed Communist Government is to be the
kind that has to stay, for not to stay would
be practically synonymous with being hanged.
The leading points of the new system are
to be as follows
“Banks, mines and large-scale industries” to
be taken over without compensation (just stolen,
that is), and put under the control of “the work-
ers.” “State and muncipal services” to be put
under control of “the toilers.’’ The difference, if
any, between workers and toilers is probably un-
important. The work-toilers will presumably super-
vise themselves. If intricate and large-scale indus-
tries don’t pay anything like working expenses when
all the old managers and organisers (the Men Who
Know How) are got rid of, it will be a calamity.
There being no place in the scheme for making
use of the Men Who Know How, and no apparent
way for them to make a living, they are probably
expected to die in the bush.
All workers, men and women, boys and girls, arc
promised at least £6 per week of 30 hours. On
last census day the Commonwealth was found to
contain 2,300,000 actual workers for pay (“bread-
winners,” they were called), and the value of their
entire production, of every sort, was set down at
not quite £394,000,000, or about £l7l per head
per year. Some difficulty may be experienced about
paying at least £312 in wages alone out of £l7l,
especially when the working time is reduced by one-
third or more and the output is further crippled by
the elimination, as public enemies, of the Men Who
Know How. Hut, in addition, industry is to carry
an extra load of indefinite size in the payment of
the full £312 per annum to the incapacitated and
the unemployed. Nobody is to be really paid for
working. He will be paid for being unemployed,
and he may work gratis if he likes.
All workers are to be unionists ; therefore, to be
thrown out of the union will presumably be equiva-
lent to being thrown out of the human race and off
the earth. This should keep the toiler in his place,
and make him very chary about being the first to
voice his discontent.
Police and soldiers are never to act against “the
workers” in any trade dispute, and presumably all
disputes will be “trade” disputes unless the Lov em-
inent says they aren’t. The police and soldieis may
look on at the massacre, or else join in.
• * * ®
The prospectus includes other items, but
these are the most showy goods in the shop
window. Nothing is said about finance, but
motherhood and childhood endowments are
promised, in addition to lavish pensions and
lavish education expenditure, and the effi-
cient military and police force which no Bol-
shevik Government can do without is an
expensive matter, so presumably there will
be finance of a sort. Fairly liberal holidays
on full pay figure on the list. A paragraph
is devoted to the abolition of patriotism, an
old-fashioned sentiment which leads people
to contemn Black Brother, and object to
him as a fellow-citizen, fellow-worker
or fellow-soldier. Still the paragraph doesn’t
specifically welcome Black Brother. He is
a topic to be broken gently.
* « * •
Some effect may be produced by exposing
schemes which are so lacking even in the
rudiments of plausibility, and which must
lead to prompt disillusionment. That is
called ap appeal to the commonsense of the
community. But no one knows better than
the boss Communists that their professions
are crazy, and that their promises are lies;
so exposure is wasted on them. It is equally
wasted on the militant section of their fol-
lowers. This section consists of the exten-
sive criminal class, and the extensive class
which is being taught to be criminal. There
is fascination in the idea of “taking over”
the possessions of the “bourgeoisie” safely
and legally and in wholesale fashion by day,
and being a notable political reformer at the
same time, instead of doing the same thing
in a dangerous and scrappy fashion by stealth
and often by night, and being an object for
the eager search of the police. The wrecker
of civilisation, like his brother on the coast,
considers that he will get more out of the
ruins of the ship than he could get by leav-
ing the vessel whole and sound and in the
possession of its original owner, so he ap-
proves of ruins. These people of no illusions
look for reinforcements among the fools of
the community, who are probably more con-
spicuous than the commonsense thereof. They
are the people who are always ready to give
the newest confidence trick “a fair trial,”
whether it be a Communistic paradise in
Paraguay or a bank which offers 18 per cent,
per annum for deposits. The party of the
Moscow Disease hopes to capture the Aus-
tralian Parliament some day when orthodox
Labor has been “white-anted” some more,
and when its opponents have wasted their
chances more than usual in the purposeless
shindy between the Bigendians of one party
and the Littlendians of a very similar party,
and when the “bourgeoisie” has been more
than usually apathetic about going to the
poll. Then the programme is plainly and
simply for the victors to dig themselves in
and let the great, unorganised, unarmed and
more or less disqualified majority be as dis-
illusioned as it pleases. It might be impos-
sible for them to dig in with the complete-
ness and permanency of their Moscow breth-
ren, but the process of digging out might
cost a great deal and leave civilisation look-
ing as if an earthquake had struck it.
* * * *
The position suggests that the Moscow
Disease is making headway. Communists run
the shipping industry, in which the hold-up
seems as if it would never quite end. and find
the seamen and watersiders amazingly docile.
They were even willing to put up a sort of
fight, under instructions, to have the Com-
munist Hall made their Sydney headquarters
for certain purposes. The law is powerless
against them, or acts as if it was. The
Labor movement is permeated with Com-
munists to an unknown extent, all of them
being there, save the few irreconcilables who
won’t give up wearing the badge openly. No
serious objection is made to Communist
doctrines inside the movement, but only to
membership of a Communist body, and advice
came from Moscow some time ago that the
wise Bolshevik should don the cloak of
hypocrisy, and get into the interior of the
fortress and become busy. Labor leaders
make all manner of concessions while pro-
testing that they will concede nothing. The
Red Objective has been accepted by some for
the sake of peace. Lang, of N.S.W., was
even reported as advising that politicians,
which term naturally includes the Govgrn-
ment and the forces at its command, should
remain torpid during industrial troubles,
which are sometimes industrial riots and
may become industrial civil war, and let
the situation fend for itself, which looks like
the new Communist doctrine in a polite form.
Possibly these leaders have a vision of their
crowd becoming a middle party and a
squeezed-out party like the Liberals in Eng-
land. Genuine Labor might have a better
chance to regain its morale and its
dicular if the Government followed the
example set by the Irish Free State, and
made the preaching and planning of rebel-
lion an offence good for 20 years’ gaol, and
threw r in permanent political disqualification.
Such an act would relieve the pressure. But,
then, Australia hasn’tthat sort of Goverument.
The Bruce crowd, unlike its warlike ances-
tor, believes it can disarm the raging lion
by politeness and forbearance. It is a sign
of the times that the other day a ballot was
taken to select five N.S.W. Labor candi-
dates for the Senate, and in the early counts
a very solid lead was established by a gentle-
man with an unfortunate gaol experience,
who used to be regarded as one of the
really deep-dyed Communists, whatever poli-
tical garment he may now drape himself in.
So, assuming permanent torpidity and neglect
of duty on the part of the overpaid Shep-
herds of the Nation, who are more akin to
sheep themselves, Bolsii and Company, Un-
limited, has a right to hope.
WHAT IS A WHITE MAN?
Tiie protest made on behalf of the Greek
nation against the limitation of the number
of Greek immigrants allowed to enter the
Commonwealth touches the whole question of
White Australia. It has been given out
to the world that we hold this continent for
the white man. The Asiatic, whether of high-
caste Aryan descent or of the lowest class,
has been barred out; the highly civilised
Chinese, with iIUOO years of culture behind
them, are as rigidly excluded as the rudest
African blacks. Yet no exact definition has
made it clear what we mean by a white man.
We freely admit the Hebrew without refer-
ence to liis Asiatic ancestry ; but we close the
door on his cousin the Arab. A family of
Western Europeans would be freely admitted
though they came to us from Asia; but a
Persian of the noblest family would be ex-
cluded, even though he could show an un-
broken descent from those who were origin-
ally one in race with the best Europe has to
offer. At present it would appear that a
white man is one of a family wiiich has re-
sided for some time in Europe ; but even this
definition requires a good deal of modifica-
tion. France has never shown any serious
prejudice against mixing with colored races;
and a family as prominent in literature as
the Dumas, father and son, could hold their
own unchallenged, though they were only a
generation or two removed from the negro.
Holland has recently thrown down barriers
and admitted to equality the half- and
quarter-castes from her Malayan possessions.
So it is clear that a good Frenchman or a
good Dutchman, fully vouched for by the con-
suls of their respective nations, may be
much further removed from any European
type than a Parsee or an Armenian. Again,
the color line is of very little assistance.
There are men in the British Islands who
have been on the soil for countless genera-
tions, and whose skins are far darker than
those of many South Sea islanders; there are
Portuguese and Italians far darker than some
of the races on the other side of the Medi-
terranean ; and there are blond types among
the Druses of Syria almost as fair as North
Germans. Obviously, as matters stand, a
very black man may be admitted to the Com-
monwealth as white, while a person with
fair hair and pale-blue eyes may be ruled out
as black. And this arbitrary arrangement of
black and white on a territorial basis is not
quite in the spirit of the White Australia
theory; for, with some broad exceptions, the
color faithfully denotes the racial character.
The black or nearly black men of Europe
have rarely any quality which would make
them desirable as Australian settlers, while
the rare white type in Asia has the under-
lying qualities of the white man elsewhere.
* * * *
The race history of any northern country
shows how incomplete the theory of a white
Europe must necessarily be. Britain, which
has maintained race purity as well as or better
than most lands, has yet a mixed foundation.
The earliest British people were those who
were buried in the long'barrows of which so
many have been examined. These were small,
dark men, of no great physique, with long
heads and oval faces. There has been no
difficulty about giving them their ethnological
place. They were at all points the same as
the ancient Iberian, who was at all points
the same as the modern Berber of Northern
Africa. So like were they to the Iberian
race of Spain that Tacitus imagined they
had recently crossed over from that country.
Naturally the Roman writer had not the
proof which the modern archaeologist possesses
that their bones had been buried on British
soil for thousands of years. They were fol-
lowed by the white Gaels and Cymri—the
people of the round burial mounds —by the
white Saxons and Angles and by the white
Danes and Normans ; but all these strong white
races settling in turn on the soil still leave
the fact unchallenged that the foundation race
of Britain was a dark-skinned people whose
blood brothers are the African Berbers. Still,
for practical purposes, Britain is white; the
more recent dark admixtures have been far
too slight to taint the national blood. But
consider the case of Spain. There the founda-
tion race was the same as in Britain ; but
around the coast early Phoenician settlements
were formed, which, in addition to bringing
Asiatic immigrants to the country, introduced
slaves of every color and nationality. A
modern Spaniard may he as fair as a Swede or
as dark as Othello ; he may have predomi-
nant in his veins the blood of Iberian, Phoe-
nician, Moor or Arab—all black within the
meaning of the White Australian gospel—or
of Ligurian, Roman, Goth or Vandal —all
somewhat white. While the descendants of
the white Cortez, with the blood and chiv-
alry of Castile evident in every action, may
become most desirable Australian citizens,
there is a good deal of doubt about the
blacker mixtures who might wish to assert
their claim to whiteness on the mere ground
that Europe has so long sheltered them. The
case of Italy is not better than that of Spain ;
Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily all have a dark
foundation. The Balkan States and Russia
show intrusive wedges of Asiatics in compara-
tively late times, and Hungary is definitely
non-European in race. For the Greek him-
self the claim is better than for many Euro-
peans, though there are clouds over his begin-
nings. All sentiment may be against throw-
ing any doubt on the whiteness of the first
people in Europe to rise to groat heights of
art and poetry ; but the Greek in action was
never a healthy person in the White Aus-
tralian sense. His art has the dew of a
new morning upon it; but he lied, tortured
and side-stepped realities in a thoroughly
Asiatic fashion. The chances are that, in
spite of the often repeated statement about
his decadence, the modern Greek is a better
man than any of his classic ancestors.
The whole White Australia idea is based
upon facts which, while they are related
to color, are not strictly dependent on it.
Through the long ages which the archaeolo-
gist lias revealed in glimpses to us, white
men in northern lands developed certain
views of life. There is a uniformity of tex-
ture about these views; and they differ
greatly from those developed by the peoples
of Asia and Africa. At the dawn of our
history they were already part and parcel
of the racial mind. Reading the story of
the Oriental nations of antiquity, we feel
that we are almost entirely on foreign
ground—foreign in the sense that neither
motives nor actions are along the lines with
which we can have an understanding sym-
pathy. Suddenly Cyrus, the white man,
appears among the riot of overgrown empires
and blatant shows of splendor. We recog-
nise him at once. Though planted in Asia,
and only concerned with things Asiatic, he is
our man and acts very much in our way.
That the Persians—a mere handful in the
midst of the teeming hosts of Babylon,
Assyria and Egypt—were soon corrupted
out of semblance to anything akin to them
by blood, does not alter the fact that their
first appearance is wholly satisfying. Even
in the days of their decay the native Per-
sians at Platea. when facing the superior
Spartan arms, were not easy to defeat. The
Asiatic and Greek allies of Xerxes were
poor stuff; but the Persians were man for
man as good as the Greeks. Yet it was not
on the battlefield that the white man really
revealed himself, though the battlefield may
have been the place where all his other quali-
ties were tested. The primitive Aryan
tongue, reconstructed from all the languages
into which it is now split, shows exactly the
manner of the white man’s life. In days when
his culture was only that of the rude stone
age, when he was onlv dimly beginning to
see the possibilities of agriculture and his
domestic animals were few, all his family
relationships were the same as they are to-
day. There you get a glimpse of the founda-
tion on which the white man has built and
of the trend of his thought. The culture of
the home circle came before pottery and
weaving and even the most rudimentary of
the crafts; and out of it grew' the first
simple idea of democracy which, though often
obscured, has never been wholly lost by any
section of the white race. Such ideas were
foreign to the primitive life of all the
darker races; and with the exception of the
Chinese —whose fundamental notions in early
times ran curiously parallel to those of white
men in Europe—nothing quite like them
has been developed since by any other
people. The external things, such as the
creation of vast empires, the building of
great cities, and the development of the arts
of luxury, change and pass; cultures are de-
veloped, broken, re-made out of fragments
of the past, lost and re-found; but the sim-
plicities of life remain through all changes.
It is out of those simplicities that racial
thought grows to its greater heights; and
it is the common heritage of these that
makes the white _ man believe that his race
is worth preserving.
THE TAMING OF THE OYSTER.
“Yes,” said the captain of the Little Ship
while we stood behind the wheel and con-
templated the primeval beauty of Port Ste-
phens on a summer morning, with Soldier
Point and Middle Island a little ahead on
the port bow, and drawing nearer as we
steamed westward towards the mouth of the
Karuali River—“yes, you may well say that.
A d—d marvel, so it is. Nothing here at
all—except the pub at Nelson’s Bay, those
two timber hulks over in Salamander and
the oyster leases. Nothing at all. And a
hundred years since the A. A. Co. settled
at Carrington over yonder! It’s one of the
wonders of Australia. You wouldn’t find it
anywhere else in the world —a harbor like
this utterly wasted and given over to oyster-
leases. You may say there’s nothing else
here. Five hundred miles of ’em.”
“What!”
“That’s right. In the Myall River and
Tilligherry Creek, the North Arm and the
Karuali, and all round these bays and islands.
Not a yard of available foreshore that’s
not taken up. Five hundred miles of oyster-
farming—where there ought to be wharves
and warehouses, and the suburbs of a city.”
This statement interested me, Mainly
for the reason that I supposed it to be exag-
gerated. But it is not. It is a modest
estimate of the extent of oyster-culture in
Port Stephens. So I set out to learn some-
thing of the domestication of Ostrea cucul-
lata, as I discovered to be his proper title.
I looked him up in books, and made inquiries
from some of liis exploiters, and learned a
good deal more about him than I had known
before —which had, indeed, only been that he
is sometimes good to eat. that Dagoes and
others retail him at about eighteenpence a
dozen, and that it is unwise to mix him
with whisky. Who and what the oyster is
is tersely and picturesquely put by the
Encyclopedia Britannica (Oth edition).
“Ostrea,” says that fascinating work, “is a
genus of T orrellilwanc 1 ' Molluscs bolo"g-
-ing to the third order, Monomya, the valves
of the shell being closed by a single large
adductor muscle. The degeneration pro-
duced by sedentary habits in all lamelli-
branches has in the oyster reached its most
advanced stage.”
The marriage of Ostrea’s parents and his
birth are processes too complicated for dis-
cussion here—a fact which is almost obvious
when it is remembered that the same oyster
is sometimes a lady and sometimes a gentle-
man, i.e., that there are alternations of sex
in the parent. However, when the young
oyster leaves the latter as a “troposphere”
it swims about freely near the surface of the
water among the multitude of other
creatures, larval and adult, which swarm
there. He is a very little fellow at this
stage of his career —only l-130th of an inch
long. He grows a bit before his travels
weary him, and when he sinks to the bottom
to pursue what the Encyclopedia calls his
sedentary habits by affixing himself to stones,
shells and other objects, he rapidly takes
on the appearance of a minute oyster, form-
ing a white disc l-20th of an inch in dia-


meter. The rest of his career is uneventful
until he is taken from his home, to he
packed in a tliree-bushel bag with a multitude
of his felloAvs. and consigned to Mr. Hellen-
opoulos in Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne or
any part of the CommoiiAvealth Avhere people
Avant to eat him: though under culture he
changes his place of residence by being trans-
ferred from ”catching’ grounds to ’ fatten-
ing.” One Professor Mobius, who seems
to have known Oslrco pretty intimately some
decades ago, has gheu it as his opinion that
oysters over 29 years of age are rare. An
assurance of this sort is a consolation to
such as have at times suspected othei-Avise.
It may be mentioned, also, that the three
sorts of oyster known as “dredge, “deep-
Avater rock” and “foreshore rock” are all
one oyster— O. cucullato. The ’’mud oyster
is a poor relation, commercially valueless:
he is O. nnfiasi.
The form of culture at present mosi in
use in Port Stephens is that of catching
and fattening upon wood-sticks or split logs,
black mangrove and swamp-oak being the
most usual material, though saAvn timber
dipped in a wash of cement is coming into
vogue. But there is also a good deal of
“stone-culture,” in which roughly-dressed
slabs of rooks are employed: and that is the
method most javorod in George’s River. A
“stick” oyster-lease at loav tide, looking from
the shoreward side, is a curious bit of
scenery. The mud-flat bristles with spikes
of wood in the fashion of an unshaven chin
that has been many days neglected, and each
bristle is covered thickly with clustering
oysters. Beyond lie the broad Avaters of
the big bay. and the far-off blue shore of
the opposite side—unless it happens that
the Avooded bank of a creek or a low-set
fl’inge of mangrove takes the place of the
distant background. The queer-looking oyster
orchards represent a good deal of wealth:
an infinity of patient endeavor, too, and
years of strenuous labor. At Port Stephens
within the last two years the business has
increased about 25 per cent.; there has in-
deed been so very large a growth of areas
occupied by leases that to-day hardly any
now ground is available. But it cannot be
assumed cheerfully that it is an easy or cer-
tain fashion of making a living. It lias many
drawbacks —quite as many as fruit-growing
or poultry-farming—and some of them are
of a nature that it is often impossible to
contend with. There is not room here to en-
large upon the ways of the mud-worm (Poly-
dorn cilinta). or the thief that cometh by
night, or the middleman who is the plain
and unabashed thief of open day; but one
deeply resented administrative injustice
under which the farmers are liable to suffer
may be mentioned. It is the old story of
insecurity of tenure.
Under the present system leases are
granted for 15 years, with a right of re-
newal for another 15. When a man has
made productive beds on previously value-
less grounds he is beginning to get some
return at the end of his first term. At the
end of the second lie is becoming an old
man—and he can get no renewal. Ilis lease
must then be put up for sale by auction or
tender, and lie finds liimself forced to com-
pete in open market for the results of his
years of hard work, possibly against wealthy
men or combinations who can easily outbid
him. He loses all he has, and is too old to
start again. He would not complain against
being called upon to pay a higher rental-
many times higher—so long as he may re-
main the owner of property which lie has
undoubtedly made valuable. But lie curses
and grumbles and has formed a very vigor-
ous league against wliar lie justifiably re-
gards as Confiscation. lie does not see why
his 30 years of sloshing about in the mud
should count for nothing.
J. H. M. ABBOTT .
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Splendid Pauper.
By persistence in lamentation the politicians
of Westralia have secured a Royal Commis-
sion to inquire into the sufferings, wrongs
and losses which the State has endured by
reason of 'Federation, and into the alleged
reasons why its smaller and, in most cases,
less richly-endowed neighbors should help.
The same dogged sticking to the point which
got Westralia a railway at the common
charge got the Commission, and may get
the subsidy. It was Nokbert Keenan, K.C.,
who set forth the case for the Cadge, and its
main features were as follows :
(1) Westralia entered the Federal compact from
a patriotic rather than a business motive, and the
dominant partners of the union had been given full
control, without any safeguard to protect the vital
interests of Westralia, except lhe totally inadequate
provision that for a limited period W.A. was to
continue control of its Customs.
(2) During the whole period of its existence as a
self-governing State; prior to Federation Westralia
faced and met the problem of developing its re-
sources with as bold a policy as any other Australian
colony.
(3) Victoria and N. S. Wales profited immensely
by Federation, and Queensland to a minor extent,
while S.A., Tasmania and Westralia all fared ill,
and Westralia by far the worst. Commonwealth com-
petition with the State Savings Bank had resulted
in considerable loss to the State, which would increase
with the lapse of time. The prohibition by the Com-
monwealth of the export of gold during the war had
affected the State seriously. The indirect loss of
taxation, despite increased taxes in the years 1915
to 1923, was heavy, apart from the falling off in
rental of mining properties and receipts for ser-
vices rendered in connection with goldfields com-
munities.
(4) The position of secondary industries in the
State since Federation had been a most difficult, if
not a hopeless, struggle against established indus-
tries and the mass production of eastern States. The
result of throwing down Customs barriers between
the States had led to Westralia becoming merely a
customer of the eastern States.
Whether Westralia went into the Common-
wealth in such an extra-large and generous
spirit that it should he paid for it is a
question which, after 24 years, is difficult
to answer. Certainly it was the only one
which extracted special concessions of any
talne. It secured a separate and profitable
Customs tariff for a number of years. It
contrived to obtain, for another number of
vears. an annual grant out of the Federal
Treasury. It got its big and unprofitable
railway supplied to it at the general charge,
making Fremantle the terminal mail-port in-
stearl of Adelaide; consequently when the
Navigation Act reduced the means of com-
munication of Tasmania and the Territory
to a minimum. Westralia had an alternative
route, and was still in a position to prosper.
It was a year after the other States had
spoken that Bigjohn Forrest put _ the
matter of joining the union to his admiring
subjects, and it has been alleged that in the
interval he was busy collecting pledges on
the subject of the East-to-West line from
probable and possible Ministers, or. in other
words, negotiating for his State’s pi'icc.
Westralia didn’t give “the dominant part-
ners’’ in the Commonwealth “full con-
trol” over its interests in any way that dif-
fered from the action of Queensland, S. Aus-
tralia or Tasmania. With one-twenty-first
part of the population it carefully annexed
one-sixth of the representation in the Senate,
so it made no special sacrifice which calls
for a handsome but belated donation. The
competition of the Commonwealth Savings
Bank has been the grievance of all the States
i qually. if it is a grievance, and the mourn-
ful mammoth of the West has as much right
to receive a bill for compensation as to pre-
sent one. The lamentation about “the prohibi-
tion by the Commonwealth of the export of
gold during the war” is also to be taken with ,
largo qualifications. Export, certainly, was
hung up for a while. But many industries
in other States were suspended altogether;
whereas the Wcstralian gold-producer was
permitted to do the best he could in the
world's market as soon as the matter could
be arranged. Finally, “the falling off
in rental of mining properties and receipts
for services rendered in connection with gold-
fields communities” is hardly a Federal re-
sponsibility. Any Golden Mile gives out if
man doesn’t leave it alone. A Brass Mile
might perform similarly. The tale of West-
ralia’s industrial decadence, which has brought
it to the bottomless and ultimate pit of
being “merely a customer of the eastern
States,” should likewise be inspected before
being consumed. The place began to have a
sort of industrial boom along with its gold
boom. Works connected with metals and
with the provision of homes for new arrivals
naturally helped. With the decline of the
gold industry the proportion of Westralia’s
population employed in factories began to
have strange ups and downs, and in
1917, the great strike year, the State ap-
peared to reach bottom. Yet with all draw-
backs Westralian factory industry reveals
such definite signs of looking up that it is
difficult to see how the splendid pauper can
build up much of a case. Dating from 1917.
when the Westralian position was at the
worst, the progress as regards employment
has been as follows:

When the youngest State has attained third
place for manufactures and is at the top of
the list for progress it doesn't seem to have
much to be miserable about, however lurid
its past may have been.

“A Sentence! Come, Prepare!”
Two boys, aged respectively eight and nine,
went to a shop in Dubbo (N.S.W.) to buy
sweets. The shop was kept by a Chinese,
and whilst the lads were on the premises
this “human monster,” as parents of the
town have described him, committed an
offence upon them usually regarded as one
calling for severe punishment. The offender
was sent for trial and brought before the
Quarter Sessions, presided over by a chair-
man whose administration has become the
despair of the police. The accused China-
man in this case was sentenced to three
months’ imprisonment, the short term being
made in effect still shorter by being pre-
dated to the day of arrest. A weak point,
and it is very weak, in all judicial systems
where the determination of the sentence im-
posed rests wholly in the hands of a presid-
ing Judge, is the human factor. Crimes
Acts and other statutes, as a rule, though
not invariably, fix a maximum penalty, and
in the case of murder an absolute one. though
even there the absolute may be avoided by a
verdict of manslaughter. The general effect
of this principle is to give the Judge a wide
range of discretion in the determination of the
punishment. It is over this area that the
human factor operates. It is well known
to practitioners on the criminal side in both
the lower and higher courts that all sorts of
ingenious subterfuges are used in order to
ensure an offender being dealt with in the
court presided over by a weak and lenient
Judge, and equal pains are expended that he
may not come before a Judge of tougher
metal. It is difficult to see how this condi-
tion of affairs can be remedied. Some dis-
cretion must be vested in the Judges. Fixed
absolute penalties without any elasticity
would cause as much mischief as the present
system, if not' more. This being so, one is
forced to the conclusion that the root of the
evil is to be found in the Executive. No
more serious duty falls to that body than the
appointment of judges, for to them the pub-
lic looks for not only the safeguarding of
liberties but the due and adequate punish-
ment of offenders against the body politic.
Much therefore, depends upon the selection,
and this is a duty that can be done only in
the dry light of the essential qualifications
for the office. It has been a custom, and a
very bad one. to make politics the doorway
to high judicial office. But it is not con-
siderations of this kind only that sway the
minds of the Executive. Some of them
are occult, not to be perceived, on any view
of the appointee and his record at the Bar.
by those qualified to give an opinion ; and
it is in the appointments to the courts pre-
sided over by District Court Judges and
chairmen of Quarter Sessions that this
occultism is most frequently found. Some-
body gets on the bench of these courts, and
why or wherefore nobody knows. Some of
the appointees, bv the grace of. Heaven, fill
their posts worthily, whilst others excite the
tears of the profession, the groans of the
police and the maledictions of the public.
It is this class who have made the first-
offenders provisions in the Crimes Acts of
several of the States a curse to the country
and “a boon and a blessing” to the criminal.
In the case of the Dubbo chairman it would
be interesting if the Executive—to justify the
wisdom of tho appointment—called for a
return of the number of instances in
which he has used these provisions for the
relief of a class for whose delinquencies so
soft a spot is found in his heart —and his
head.

The Burning Homes of Ireland.
The frequent and appealing hat has
arrived again, making three belltoppers that
have landed here in about as many years.
One of them, borne by a priest and a lay-
man. was to collect funds openly for another
bloodstained uprising in Ireland. Beckon-
ing that this country had no call to shed the
blood of a sister Dominion. N. S. Wales
Minister Oakes took advantage of the
absence of his flickering chief, and had the
pair deported. It was really the Prime
Minister’s business, but he was temporarily
dead, as he is liable to be at any crisis.
Another eady w’as to contain funds for the
starving millions in that earthly paradise.
Soviet Russia. What the bearer did with
the collection, if any, is forgotten. In the
present case two Irish ladies want a modest
£IO,OOO for the benefit of certain rebels who
were captured by the Irish Free State
Government while knocking saucepans out
of the peace in 1923, and put into intern-
ment camps. A Russian Government would
have held a wholesale execution, but the
Irish Cabinet treated most of its arrestees
as well as usually happens to prisoners of
war. The Daily Mail Year Book
sketched that exciting time :
The year was, so far as the newly-constituted
Irish Free State was concerned, perhaps one of the
worst in history. It was for the whole country a
period of almost unrelieved anxiety approaching to
despair. Many times over, for stretches of weeks
together, hardly a day passed without its tragic
talc of battles, ambushes, kidnappings and murders,
and the wanton pillage and destruction of loyalist
houses... .More burnings, fresh destruction of
public and private property to an estimated damage
of at least £25,000,000, guerilla lighting in many
places over the 26 counties, and a fiercer outbreak
of pillage and murder... .Well might the 60 Free
State Senators boast on December 18 that, in assent-
ing to the Adaptation of Enactments Dill, they had
legalised “the first Act passed by an Irish Parlia-
ment in 128 years," Within three months hardly
one of them had a roof over his head.
The prisoners were released some little
time ago, along with their Spanish-American
leader, in the hope that they would resume
peaceful habits. The leader certainly hasn’t
—in fact, clemency has had no visible effect
on the brigandish product of New York, and
lie is the same firebrand as before. About
liis discharged followers there is apparently
very serious doubt also, for the popular or
majority Government has just secured the
passage of a stringent Act to deal with the
next rebellion. It provides for treason, con-
spiracy, planning and inciting to revolution
and tiie like. True, famine lias come into
evidence in Ireland, a bad season having
eventuated on top of the ravages of De
Valera’s flayers and scorchers: but the
objective of the ladies who > hold out the
caubeen to this community isn't so much to
aid the sufferers as those who did their best
to cause the suffering,*,No, doubt both of
the ladies are genuine. ’Bftt they talk
too much about “independence.” and are too
enthusiastic about the patriotism and sur-
passing merit of De Valera’s followers,
and make it too clear that any local sub-
scription will be regarded as a censure upon
the Legislature and Cabinet of a self-govern-
ing Dominion. It is no part of Australia’s
business to meddle with the internal politics
or upheavals of any free and self-governing
sister Dominion, whether it be Maoriland,
Canada, Newfoundland or Ireland. There-
fore. if there is any desire l’ l tlmse nar f s to
relieve Irish distress, it would be best to have
this country’s own agent take the money
across, and see that it is so distributed that
it w r on’t be mistaken for a subsidy to any
political faction, especially one which is, so
fond of carrying guns’
A Small Job for Fuller.
Dear Bulletin, —The hesitating Premier of
N. S. Wales has decided to hold that short
final session which he promised, and though
he may possibly undecidc again, for the mind
that is made up can be made over, it looks
as if some good work was in prospect. In
a sort of manifesto he lately explained to
the country that his Government had really
yakkered like a nigger and done most of
what it promised. Fuller and Co. cer-
tainly have achieved more good work than
Lang and his quarrelsome lot would have
done. Yet the list of their omissions is
large enough. They didn’t repair the rot-
ten City Council franchise. They did
nothing for the subdivision of the State, or
the development of the unused and excom-
municated ports. They failed to mitigate
the great estate-agency swindle, or the rush
of bubbly new insurance companies. And
the ever-to-be reformed Upper House re-
mains where it was yesterday, and where it
was 13 Cabinets ago, when its repair was
also an urgent question, and not for the
first time by any means. The reasons for re-
construction weren’t exactly the same then
as now, but the urgency was almost as
great. The present situation is as follows:
The Upper House, which once consisted entirely
of men with large property and with all the
prejudices of their class, has been invaded of late
years, like the Sydney Municipal Council, by min
with a singular absence of property. The rush for
nominations is intense, yet many of the applicants
have, or would have if they got in, no visible means
of support except their honorary jobs, and there
is poor sustenance in an unpaid billet which doesn’t
even carry refreshments. The title, unlike tnat of
an earl, doesn’t bring the owner offers of well-paid
company directorships, nor does it improve his
or his son’s chance of marrying a beautiful million-
airess. Suspicious persons have endeavored to
account for the unaccountable situation by saying
that some of the unpaid might possibly scratch out
a living by taking fees for piloting bills through
the House, and by being remunerated for approving
of new railways or for ceasing to disapprove of
them; in other words, by blank and mangy corrup-
tion. They say that a man who meets his
constituents every third year has to ay to look
honest, but a man with a life appointment and no
constituents can be found out with impunity.
There is a tendency to appoint Sydney and sub-
urban men to the Upper Council and leave the rest
of the State unrepresented. The idea presumably
is that a man with a business at Armidale or
Lismore can’t be expected to neglect it for the sake
of an appointment with no salary and very little
distinction attached. The Government doesn’t can-
to be so cynical as to assume that there may be a
salary, though not a visible one, and that a poor,
but smart, man from the bush might got. along all
right. The tipper House’s allpgod bleak indifferrnee
to all projet ts which are not for the immediate
benefit of the big city and the districts geographi-
cally attached to it has often been commented on
with wrath.
An Upper House of the N.S.W. type offers few
visible attractions to men of intellect who are n it
axe-grinders. A British peer, anomalous as his
position is, may get some shreds of inspiration out.
of pride in his ancestors if his title isn’t absurdly
new, pride in the son who is to succeed him, or
devotion to his caste. The nominee life M.L.C. need
have no perceptible ancestors; his son doesn't come
alter him; and he belongs to no specific casts.
Even love of country isn’t much of an incentive in a
position where there is so little chance to do Ihings
for cue country.
The stereotyped proposition for Ma State
Upper House “reform,’’ though it never comes
off and no one shows any real interest in it, is
to appoint the honorary nominee for a term
instead of giving him a life sentence. Seven
years is almost invariably suggested, pos-
sibly because Nebuchadnezzar was mad
for that period, or else in honor of the
Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. This change
would make the House even less dignified
than it is, but no more representative and
no more responsible to the people. The
reason for appointing city and suburban men
almost exclusively, and the old hostility to-
wards country interests, would remain. If
there really are M’s.L.C. who live on the
game they would have to live harder, having
less time in which to live. A long-lived
Ministry might have time to make a com-
plete Legislative Council out of its own
party, and finish the process just before its
party went out, and might even make it out
of defeated candidates of its party, thus
producing an ideal House of Rejects and
Umvanteds. The seven-year method might:
eliminate the very aged, but no positive evi-
dence exists that the aged nominee is the
most pernicious nominee. A sort of posi-
tive reform might be arrived at by turning
the Council into an elective and paid and
responsible institution, for which purpose
the State might possibly be sawn into three
constituencies —north, central and south—
and letting the two bodies settle their dif-
ferences, which I hope would be many, in
joint sitting. There would be, at least, an
air of permanency about this settlement,
which doesn’t attach to any scheme for
creating a Chamber of Honorary Irrespon-
sibles for a period, and then having a fresh
distribution or auction of patronage. And
a House constructed on these lines would be
almost bound to know something beyond the
County of Cumberland.—Yours, etc., Sum-
mon Malaprop.
Our Murky Deliverers.
Zinovieff is again denying, or his friends
are doing it for him, that lie wrote the let-
ter. The document which went astray con-
cerned the organisation of the African nig-
ger against the white race and white
civilisation. The enrolment of the nigger for
the. general destruction of white institutions
being an avowed feature of the Communist
programme, in Australia and elsewhere, all
this mock astonishment seems waste of
energy. Quite recently the Red Agglomera-
tion in this country reissued its hackneyed
manifesto on the nigger topic. It stated
that the local Communist gang is “a section
of the Communist International,” which
means that it gets its orders from foreign
headquarters, and that it is quite “irrespec-
tive of race, creed or color.” It “strives to
unite the workers of all countries, nationali-
ties and colors” against the capitalist; and
when it brings its motley horde here to kill
off every Australian who is suspected of being
“bourgeois." there is every prospect that the
horde will stay and settle, as hordes mostly
do. It declares, further, that it stands for
“international working-class action.” One
might start an international butchery in Eng-
land with the aid of purely European allies
.—very uncouth, perhaps, but still European.
They would be handy; in fact, they
would be almost the only available
international material. But in Aus-
tralia, with colored folk in swarms to
west and north, and some of them to east
also, and nothing white to the south, the
blatant ruffian, who starts to internasli in a
revolutionary way is shouting for colored
occupation: the army which liberates the
white Australian from his adult suffrage,
and his State or Federal savings-bank ac-
count, and his old-age pension, and his work-
man’s compensation, and the freehold of his
suburban cottage, and his insurance policy,
and probably his job, cannot be anything else
but a polyglot and probably polygamous nig-
ger. The Australian is wonderfully patient,
or submissive, with the truculent and largely
alien push which throws mud at his white
ideal.
Twin Curses of the North.
An American observer has given this descrip-
tion of the condition of the poor white trash
that inhabits the malaria and hookworm belt
in Uncle Sam’s tropics:—
It is hard to believe that such miserable people
exist within the limits of our glorious democracy.
Their isolation is complete, and they look upon
every stranger with deep suspicion. Thousands are
infected with malaria, and a large proportion of
the children and young adults also have hook-
worm. Their complexions are always pale and
sallow, and their blood, placed on a glass slide,
is pale orange, not red. Their children either sit
still all the time or move very slowly; they never
romp and play. A putty-faced boy in overalls,
about 31 feet in height, picked at random, is found
to be 22 years old, and there can be no doubt of
his age, for 20 later children of his mother can
be accounted for, either in the shape of other
putty-faces or as tragic mounds in the front yaid,
bordered by pathetic little bits of white crockery
or empty snuff bottles. Life for all these children
is a succession of racking chills and fever, broken
by the lethargy anl gnawing hunger of hookworm.
One interesting characteristic of the popu-
lation of the fever-belt is its disastrous
fecundity; another is the lowering of intelli-
gence due to one or other of the infections.
The American scientists who are tackling the
problem get no sympathy from the stricken
population. “Th’ ain’t eny godum use for
these docs t’ tech these godum skeeters. It
they’d tek away them godum sourin’ pine-
cones we wud’nt hev these godum chills,
shouted an influential white citizen of one
miserable village. Another local specialist
attributed the symptoms to' an overdose of
water-melon. There are upwards of six mil-
lion people floating derelict in this Sargasso
Sea of American civilisation, and Uncle Sam

lias spent billions of dollars and all his
energy and skill in bringing succor, but with-
out conspicuous success. To drain all the
swamps, screen all the houses and put shoes
on all the people, and then train them all
to cleanly habits of living, is the solution.
“In brief.” concludes an American report,
“the whole thing is as simple and easy as it
would be for a one-armed man to empty
the Great Lakes witli a spoon.” The thing
has baffled Uncle Sam, because it has become
too deeply rooted. Only a wave 100 ft. high
along that coast of desolation would cleanse
it Australia’s problem has not gone far,
but it is already on the premises. Thirty-
one and a half per cent, of the miners of
Ipswich (Q.) and 75. S per cent, of those
of the Howard-Torbanlea group (Q.) were
found to be infected with hookworm in a
recent examination. Cases were found in
Newcastle (N.S.W.). Of 210.752 persons
examined by the Hookworm Campaign in
Tropical Australia and New Guinea, 48,381
were liarboring the germ. Filaria is spread
all along the coast of Queensland and the
Gulf Country. With malaria lying like
a vapor over the tropical lands to
the north, Australian ports may be said
to be in a constant state of siege from this
invader, and sporadic outbreaks have fre-
quently been traced to the arrival of ves-
sels from “the East.” Of 829 persons exam-
ined in Queensland only 40 had the infec-
tion that the anopheles brings, but that dire
destroyer breeds in our tropical regions in
billions, only waiting the advent of a malarial
host to infect them. Eternal vigilance in
the face of those twin curses of the North
is the price Australia will have to pay for
the development of her tropical territory—
and that means also the continued posses-
sion of this continent.
A Great Fall in Queensland.
When the Greater Brisbane Bill, providing
as it did for adult suffrage, compulsory
voting and unlimited rating, was passed last
year there was a joyous impression that the
municipal government of the Queensland
capital had been made safe for the Labor
party. That party already controlled a num-
ber of the districts to be amalgamated, and
for the conquest of the others a vast exten-
sion of municipal socialism was projected—
one gentleman, prominent in “the move-
ment,” held out. high hopes of free picture-
shows and free trams. When hostilities
began. Premier Theodore, Gillies, who ex-
pects to succeed him. and otlmr Trades Hall
warriors took the field on behalf of the pledge
and-Caueus candidates, and referred with
contempt to the opposing crowd, certainly
not a thrilling lot, and their platform—“a
thing as limp as a wet rag.” the Premier
called it. On election-day, however, some-
thing went wrong with the works. When
107,584 votes had been counted for the
mayoralty, Keogh, the leader of Labor’s
municipal party, had 44,700 and Jolly,
of the United party, 62,884. In the
contests for 20 aldermen another Iveogii was
elected for Fortitude Valley (a third Keogii
vas beaten in Sandgate). while ex-Treasurer
Fitielly got in for Paddington, .T. P. Teefey
for Brisbane, A. Lawrie for Buranda. and
W. ,T. Warmington for Ithaca, all Labor
strongholds. But the other 15 Labor can-
didates were defeated, although several of
them stood for suburbs which send Labor
members to the State Parliament. And the
majorities against them were, with very few
exceptions, substantial. Some of the electors
may have been influenced by reports as to
how municipal Sydnev has been run by the
Lambert-Bailey regime, and by that of
Paddy Stokes and Mick Burke. But it
looks as if the majority was intent on show-
ing that it is utterly weary of the party
which has misruled Queensland since 1915.
and which will have to fight a Federal and
a State election next year.

Jacky Dingo.
“7 PN”; Before we can launch our war on
Jacky Dingo it will be necessary to recon-
cile employing-class interests with those of
the toiling masses, and that is a pretty big
order. One of the things that have helped
to make the dingo-menace the appalling
problem it has grown into of late is the ani-
mosity that exists between these sections.
While they have been occupied snarling at
one another this sneaking red factor has
sprung into being between them like an evil
shadow. To-day the prick-eared curse is
threatening Australia’s greatest industry in
almost every quarter of the continent where
sheep are raised and grazed. The workers
claim that the land-owning classes have
earned their hostility, and that henceforth
anything that proves to be the squatters’
enemy shall be their friend. Consequently
many devious ways are being used to spread
the pest. Trappers and shooters realise
that there is big money promising in this
business shortly, and as soon as dog-catch-
ing is declared a national industry there will
be plenty of back-country talent to see that
the supply of wild does never runs out. The
crux of the trouble is that the protection of
Australia’s great sheep-industry is regarded,
as things stand to-day, as almost purely a
class-advantage. Since wool prices took to
sky-rocketing, the big squatting interests
are tighter than ever on the subject of letting
go a single acre of land for closer settlement.
In quarters so far away as British immigra-
tion depots it is known that there is hardly
one acre of suitable land available in Aus-
tralia to-day for one stray land-seeker. So
great is the earth-hunger that Australia can-
not supply the needs of her own people in
those districts where prosperous industries,
such as wool, are run. Of course, the un-
prosperous districts don’t count. A while ago
a ballot for land took place in Australia’s
biggest wool-centre —Longreach (Q.). to wit
—when 6000 applications were put in for
a single block. Some fool reared up on his
hind legs then and remarked joyously that
this was a record for Australia —or the
world, I forget which. Perhaps he meant
it was a bad record. In any case the crime
carries its own penalties. The exact date
when the national returns from dog-catching
will equal those from growing wool isn’t
known, but at the present rate of progress
it should happen within 20 years. Wild-dog
destruction is quite unlike eradicating
prickly-pcar or blowflies. With the innate
THE STRAPHANGER.
“Asked if the Government intended to try to rectify the glaring electoral anomalies that exist in
Victoria by bringing down a scheme of Redistribution, Mr. Allan said the question would not be con-
sidered by Cabinet for a long time. It was not due to come up until the last session of Parliament
in two years’ time, and the Government would not worry about it till then.”
PREMIER ALLAN: “Madam, I cannot a-bear to see a woman standing; consequently I
will proceed to close my eyes and keep 'em shut until we reach the end of
the journey.”
cleverness of the hound will be found com-
bined the land-holder’s human enemies, and
the villainy of the two will be hard to van-
quish. Unanimity of determination in the
destruction of wild dogs would blight the
most potential pest we have in Australia
to-day ; but then, as I say, thanks to class-
consciousness and industrial hostility, there
isn’t any.
Talk.
R. S. Ross asks leave to indulge a bad habit:
The leader on “Representation” (B. 12/2/’25;
thrusts greatness upon me only to leave my argu-
ment strutting crpokedly, like Malvolio in his aber-
ration. I have for my consolation the thought that
the great argument never ends, but marches on
from precedent to precedent.
What sense is there in arguing against speech,
since, like sight, it is? Reason delectably until the
Crack of Doom, and you won’t alter the funda-
mental power of talk. Back of the Parliamentary dis-
cussion that influences no votes stand the. Caucus,
the Cabinet and the Conference, all alike influenced
by words. Even Mussolini rules more by talk than
by terror. Greece and Rome fell by the sword
—not by speech, but for lack of the might v
speeches that alone shall save in the finish and in
the crisis and the war. Speech is the barometer of
culture, and where culture is not civilisation is in
the same place. “Man is only man by speech,”
said Humboldt, and none may better the instruc-
tion.
No less than The Bulletin am I perturbed by the
pimples and parasites upon public speaking and by
the gibbering manifestations that burlesque or befoul
it. The complaint is with those who construe the
counterfeit as the art. The plea is that oratory
is embraced within the art that enfolds all the arts,
and that its national neglect is the real sound and
fury signifying dementia naked and unashamed. May
one not ask that the alert and awakened resist the
predatory paws of the puppets of Platitude, and- light
a flame for the laurels of Eloquence? As the ora-
tory, so shall the strength of Australia be.
Since The Bulletin gave me generous space on
the subject I have been deluged with cynicism and pro-
verb. “Silence is golden” has been flung as a glove
into the arena, though silence is often cowardly.
Artistically at least, silence is golden only when
speech isn’t the better way. “Kind words butter
no parsnips,” a challenger said to my prayer for
great words. “No, but they sugar them,” 1 said,
and that is the artistry of the matter, and finally
all there is to the controversy. On the proverb’s own
ground, moreover, parsnips but provision the belly,
while words store the mind. “Actions speak louder
than words,” cried another—and yet, said I, speak
not at all without words; for nothing voiceless is
immortal. I quarrelled, too, with the loud and
lengthy talker who wouldn’t sea that it was harder
to talk well, and also with the mystic who insisted
that to the eye and not to the ear did we owe art
the fulcrum. Thinking on that since, I glimpse
that if half the culture given to the eye had been
given to the ear, it would have made impossible the
displacement of the legitimate drama by the shal-
lower movie.
I like that idea, set out in “Representation,” of
homogeneous constituencies as the basis of the State,
but think the acceptance of the idea will be deter-
mined by the talk about it. I will at any rate
affirm that Democracy stands or falls with Public
Speaking, that throughout Australia speaking is
being done to death by derision, and that here is the
danger-signal for all who care for Democracy, for
all ambitious for Australia. In a subtly-significant
way the two are one.
The way not only of tlie transgressor but of
the reformer is hard. Society has a playful
little way of crucifying its benefactors. They
are regarded as fools, and from the point of
view of self they generally are fools. And
society does not suffer fools gladly. “Here
are we engaged in business, trying to take
each other down, trying to make profits;
why should we be disturbed and worried
about reforms? Why does not the man
attend to his own business? The fellow is
a fool!” That is the voice of the herd, and
the herd instinct is strong in all of us. Yet,
thank God, there are still some such fools in
the world : they are the salt of the earth and
preserve it from putrefaction ! The B.M.A.
in Sydney recently sent in its little bill for
costs —some two thousand pounds—and Dr.
Thompson, its adversary, has gone insol-
vent ; a benevolent Government lias threat-
ened to cut off his telephone, and the
Municipality of Sydney his electric light.
That is the law of the herd : the crippled dog is
always destroyed by the pack. If Birken-
head was not entirely right he was at least
honest and near the mark—the instinct of
the brute still persists. Dr. Thompson
inspired a public inquiry into the saneness
or otherwise of Mrs. Farr, who has since (in
England) been declared sane. For this
public inquiry he personally paid the cost:
and a grateful country not only permitted
him to pay, but refused to relieve him of his
liability. Incidentally, he was expelled
from the 8.M.A., and, though a jury gave
him damages, the law, as interpreted by
judges, carried the day—with the result
before mentioned.

J. S. Garden, of the Communist Eden, has
lately announced the policy of his party. It
stands for a 30-hour week and a minimum
wage of £6, irrespective of age and sex.
Also, free compulsory education up to the
18th year. Garden’s fellow-workers in
China labor in the factories of the foreign
and native capitalists for 72 hours a week
day-shift, and 89 night-shift. In some mills
over 100 hours are worked. The old argu-
ment that the native factories are crude
and inefficient is not borne out by the figures
of industrial progress, either. In 1919 there
were 659,752 cotton spindles and 2050 looms
in China; to-day there are over 2,000,000
spindles and over 13,000 looms. This in spite
of civil war and anarchy, a tariff so low
as to be almost invisible, and the competi-
tion of the rest of the world, including
F.S.A., which toils for 55 hours a week, and
Britain, which spins for 45 to 48. Garden's
party also believes in universal brotherhood.
Freetrade and no defence. If he will explain
where his leisurely and unwalled Paradise
fits into the strenuous picture, public suspi-
cion that his Eden is all snake may be
allayed.

“S.W.H.”: A motor-'bus is not so safe as
a tram, consider it how you like. The
former makes its own track—which is mostly
all over the road—and is, therefore, a greater
danger to pedestrians and other road-traffic.
Three of the most recent accidents to ’buses
in Sydney have been attributed to faulty
steering-gear, a trouble that a tram
never suffers from, because it has no
steering-gear. Another crash was ascribed
to the driver taking ill (the poor devil
broke a blood vessel and was picked up
dying), a happening that opens up a field
of possibilities. There is no medical exami-
nation for ’bus-drivers. If they can show
that they can handle the big cars and “look
all right” (as one ’bus-driver put it when
I questioned him) they get the jobs. A
tram motor-man has to get through a severe
medical test, and most of them serve a long
apprenticeship as conductors before they
get their tickets. Again, a tram can be
slopped much more promptly than a ’bus, and
the brakes of the former do take effect
when applied, which is more than can be
said of those on a ’bus, especially in wet
weather. To anyone who likes thrills I can
recommend a ride down George-street, Syd-
ney, from the Central Station to Haymarket,
on a wet day, with the road greasy. One
night I counted 27 ’buses that could not
come down the hill without skidding; only
two completed the journey in a straight
line. One big vehicle gracefully slid nearly
50 yards, side on. before the driver resumed
control of it. The screams of passengers
could be heard three blocks off. This inci-
dent took place in the middle of the crowded
traffic on a Friday evening. And, finally, he
who says that a ’bus is more comfortable to
travel in is talking rubbish. The Railway Com-
missioners (and not in N. S. Wales alone)
will have to realise that they are up against
competition ; and they will have to meet that
competition in the ordinary business w r ay.
To have allowed the ’bus to grow in popular
favor without making a kick is most unfair
to the public, which owns the trams and has
to meet the losses out of taxation. The
trams will have to use publicity like any
other concern, and nersuade likely customers
that they offer the best service.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The dreadful truth is out that the Com-
monwealth Government line of steamers ate
up £245,474 of Consolidated Revenue be-
tween September 1, 1923, and March 31,
1924, and that the estimated loss for the year
is £480,969. That was exclusive of depreci-
ation. The position is really a lot worse
than these figures suggest, for in 1923 the
book value of the fleet was wCttcn down
from £12,766,588 to £4,718.150, and depre-
ciation was reckoned at £493,072 in 1922.
Prospective purchasers are invited to com-
municate with the management of the bank-
rupt concern. And, by way of encouraging
them to come forward, one more steamer
chartered the Government has been de-
clared “black,” and another strike has
occur ed on a recommissioned boat because
the supposed rulers of the country presumed
to engage seamen they formerly employed on
the s.s. Fordsdalc, the latter having been
boycotted for working without permission
from Mr. Walsh and Mr. Johannssen.
After hearing how Sydney aldermen
change their minds about tenders and other
things, The Bultjetin realises what the
civic motto means: “I take, but 1 sur-
render.”
The general executive of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation has fined its Port
Adelaide branch £2OOO, and the Fremantle
branch £lOOO, for refusing to work steamers
chartered by the Commonwealth Government,
as specified in the agreement for the settle-
ment of the Sydney waterfront wrangle. It
is a curious commentary on the frequent
statement that it is out of the question for
the Arbitration Court to impose substantial
penalties on award-breaking unions.
The Federal Court refused to penalise the
Seamen’s Union even by the formality of de-
registration, alleging that it was now com-
plying with the law, and that to do anything
to a union which was obeying the Court
might make it so mad that it would carry on in
a way calculated to scare the poor old Court
out of its boots. Actually the union wasn’t
obeying the law then, and it has shown no
sign of doing so since. But the Ministry of
S(mall) M(an) Bruce seems to have become
too feeble even to threaten. As reported
lately of Sun Yat Sen, it is sinking fast.
Freetrade did a trial canter the other day
in the Commons. The Baldwin Govern-
ment is cheerfully restoring the semi-Pro-
tective duties which Ramsay Macdonald
abolished, and adding thereto, and it has
broken new ground bv proposing a bonus for
home-grown beet sugar. McClumsy solemnly
censured it on the plea that its doings “must
lead to a system of general tariffs,” which
he spoke of as a self-evident horror, like
ingrowing toenails. Baldwin replied that it
would probably lead just there; one disillu-
sioned Laborite said that Freetrade wasn’t a
policy but the absence of one; and the House,
by a majority of 189, refused to care even if
“general tariffs” "were looming.
In the N. S. Wales Labor party’s ballot
for Senate candidates, Grant, sometime of
the 1.W.W., got 1.148 more primary votes than
“Jupp” Gardiner, deputy-leader of the party,
and a Labor politician, off and on, since
1891. This is Gardiner’s reward for" sug-
gesting at an A.L.P. conference that “the old
objective had been turned down in favor of
an objective made in another country because
it was too Australian.” Preferences put the
Australian ahead of the noisy importation,
but, should only one N. S. Wales Labor
Senator be elected next year, as was the
case in 1919, Grant will be the one if lie can
secure a corresponding advantage in primary
votes. Meantime the usual committee is in-
vestigating the customary charge of “irregu-
larities.”
The Bishop of Salisbury, the cable says,
considers it high time his Church made itself
felt in the matter of immigration. “The best
way,” said the Bishop, “to ensure a continua-
tion of Anglo-Saxon traditions and customs
throughout the Empire is to give settlers to
the Dominions who have been brought up
in the right atmosphere.” My Lord’s inten-
tions are doubtless excellent, and nobody is
going to be hurt by being brought up in an
atmosphere of honesty and diligence. But:
when it comes to “traditions and customs” —
well, the plain truth is that most of the
immigrants we have got for the past 100
years have come because they wanted to
escape those things. And most of those we.
will acciuire for the next 100 years will
doubtless be got with a promise of the same
escape.
MAKING A STEADY THING OF IT.
“A new Commonwealth loan is to be issued, chiefly on account of the States.”
THE BOSS: “No use turning her out of the hail We’ll leant to milk her again in a
minute.”
Steamer freights for wheat to Europe are
now 555. per ton —a fraction under Is. 6d.
per bushel. That is what Freetrade means.
The Protectionist wants to build up indus-
tries in Australia to consume our own wheat
and save the farmer that eighteenpence.
’Hitherto in Britain, unlike some other
countries, the foreign lady has become
British, and consequently proof against de-
portation, by marrying a British male sub-
ject, however objectionable; after which she
may proceed to have a large family of objec-
tionable British children. It is now pro-
posed to alter this, by requiring that the
bride’s character shall stand rigid inspection.
Failing to pass the test she may be torn
from her husband’s arms and shipped home
just the same. This may prove a serious
loss of income to the husband, if he is a
person who sells the benefit of British
nationality rather promiscuously.
For a week past everybody in Sydney,
with the exception of a privileged minority,
lias been working a little harder so that the
minority aforesaid may work a lot less. This
is the inevitable result of the 44-liour week
for City Council employees instituted by
sycophantic Labor aldermen at the bidding
of the union that put them in power; and
no amount of inspired oratory will make
it anything else. The last census of Tibet
(taken in 1737) showed a population of
316,000 llamas who didn’t work and 635,950
ordinary people who did. Applying the same
proportions to Australia, this country could
support nearly 2 000.000 municipal prayer-
wheel spinners. So the process can continue
for quite a while yet before the nation com-
mits complete suicide.
The Baldwinl Government, in deference to
Australian susceptibilities, is about to rc-
christen the Colonial Office the Imperial Office
and make some other changes to eliminate a
word that has come to be regarded as invidi-
ous by self-governing dominions. The curi-
ous thing about it is that, while there have
been spasmodic protests about the retention
of the old term since the Australian colonies
became States (including one by Arthur
Lynch in the House of Commons itself), at
least one part of the Commonwealth has been
so little troubled by the word that it has
never lifted a linger to revise it out of its
own vocabulary. Westralia still retains its
“Colonial Treasurer” and “Colonial Secre-
tary,” who figure as such in proclamations in
every issue of the Government Gazette.
According to the cable, the British Par-
liament re-opened “without ceremony” and
got at once to business. The Government
proposes to devote March to finance, so that
it may begin the new financial year on April
1 witii everything in order, instead of bring-
ing along the accounts, Australian fashion,
months late, and remarking that it doesn t
matter what the House thinks, as the money
is spent. The idea of beginning “without
ceremony” should be enthusiastically copied
here. Next thing should be to cut down the
debate on tlmt Australian nuisance, the vote
of censure,, to one sitting. When the cen-
surer has stated his case that should suffice.
After the parson has preached it is spinning
out the agony for the whole congregation to
preach also. And one speech for the defence,
by any Minister who may be put up for the
purpose, should be enough for all purposes.
South Aus. suffers from J.P.’s justice, too.
A 19-.vear-old Englishman, a new arrival,
walked' from Adelaide to Tanunda, about 29
miles, to get a job among the vineyards in
the district. Finding he was about six
weeks too early, he tramped back to Port
Adelaide, hoping for waterside work. He
was found asleep on a wharf early in the
morning, and was so utterly knocked out
that a kindly policeman fed him. The appa-
rently honest trier was then brought before
the Bench, and as he had no money and no
employment offering, two Justices of the
Peace, with characteristic tliick-headedness,
lined him £1 and 15s. costs, in default seven
days. Naturally he had no real option
he had to "choose” the seven days. It may
be practically impossible to cut the J.P. out
altogether so far as the Bench 'work of coun-
try townships is concerned, but this was a
case tried in the princinal port and second
town of the State —a State witli a Labor
Government, too, by the way.
A cable mentions that Glasgow Laborites
are opposing the presentation of the freedom
of the city to on e of the King’s younger sons
on the ground that the honor should be re-
served for men who have rendered their coun-
try special service. The shadowy distinction
being one that it costs little or nothing to
confer, it doesn't seem as if there were much
to get excited about. A more effective pro-
test against royal deadheadism might have
been made by the wild men of the Clyde
when their party was in office and their own
Ministers had control of the Parliamentary
purse-strings. In the matter of royal grants
and emoluments it looks as if the recipients
have much less to fear from Labor than they
had from some of the sturdy Radicals of
other days. Forty years ago and more, men
like Dilke, the baronet, and Labouchere, the
wealthy newspaper proprietor, used to peg
away year after year to get the taxpayers
relieved of some of the minor burdens of
hereditary monarchy. While they accom-
plished much against heavy odds, they left
a good deal to be done; but the job of hav-
ing the whole system of royal grants and
perquisites revised was about the last thing
apparently that Labor-in-office thought of
bothering itself about.
Melbourne Tram Board will be recast in
a few months, when the term for which
present members were appointed expires.
The Labor Government gave Cameron a
year’s extension, so he will warm the chair
till August. T. O’L. Reynolds (vice-
chairman) is likely to be retained, but it
will take a lot of string-pulling to save more
than half the others. The Composite Gov-
ernment has arrived at the conclusion that
there would have been little or no bus
problem if the Board had looked ahead and
Cameron had applied some of the knowledge
he should have gained from his world-trip.
The Turkish Government, which carries
on ns if it had won the Great War instead
of being licked, lately deported the Greek
Patriarch from Constantinople. It said it
disliked the look of him, and added some
vague remarks about the holy man interfer-
ing in local politics, which is exactly what
.Tohanson does here, only more obviously.
Greece intimated that it would appeal to
the League of Nations, and the Turk re-
sponded that it might appeal to its grand-
mother. The League is understood to hold
the view that the matter isn’t one for its
interference—it generally takes that atti-
tude when a State with nine army corps tells
jt. to go and get work. With Abyssinia and
Siam included it is mostly a colored partner-
ship now. Possibly for this reason Costa
Rica resigned the other day. The Rich
Coast is the whitest of the small American
republics, and possibly the proud hidalgo
regarded the arrival of Abyssinia as the last
straw.
One R. D. Lane, who was beaten by
Harry Mann, retired public servant, for the
Perth seat in the Westralian Assembly, is
to oppose another Mann, also a retired
public servant, for the Perth seat in the
House of Reps. He won the Labor selection •
ballot. It. is only a few years since the
same R. D. Lane was mentioned at a
Farmers and Settlers’ conference as a pros-
pective Cocky candidate for the Senate; but
Westralian Labor is unusually tolerant in
these matters. Compare its treatment of
Bill Angwin, now Acting Premier, though
he was an avowed conscriptionist during the
war, with the life-disqualification handed out
to every Labor conscriptionist in N. S. Wales
and other States.
Goudie, Vic.’s Minister of Works, got the
shock of his life when a man with a taste
for research or a sense of humor applied, to
the District Court for authority to register
his motor-’buses under a seventeenth-century
Act that hasn’t been heard of since Diek
Turpin used to “work” the York-road.
Application was made under the venerable
and unrepealed statute for license to
run ’buses from Melbourne to Reser-
voir as “stage coaches,” and the Court,
having only to satisfy itself, as by
law required, that the “stage coaches” could
travel faster than three miles an hour, sanc-
tioned their appearance. Had the ’Bus
Act repealed the Carriages Act, which was
consolidated in the Vic. statutes in 1915,
there could have been no such application.
Tommy Walker, who led the strenuous life
in N. S. Wales at the tail of last century
and is now Speaker of W.A., has been giving
the Sydney Prohibitionists his impressions
of Dry America. Says Tommy:—
I went to Peoria, the great whisky town of
America, where formerly there were 11 distilleries.
The secretary of the Chamber of Commerce put into
my hand documents published by the Chamber, which
showed that the prosperity of the city was so great
that they could not get enough railway trucks to
carry away the products of the city. Where 1000
people were formerly employed in the distilleries,
now there are 4000 employed in the manufacture of
food.
A “great” town where 4000 persons
employed in making food (variety unspeci-
fied) make so much of it that all the avail-
able trucks in the U.S. can’t carry it away
reads like bunkum out of Bedlam. As for
the rest of the Tommywalkerot, the great re-
public has become the most homicidal white
man’s land on earth ; the latest record of 2S
cities puts murders at 72 per million people
per annum, against 30 in Italy, nine in Spain,
and so on down to two per million in Swit-
zerland.
“IF.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The Queensland Labor party is considering the
claims of various candidates for the party leadership.
It is expected that a successor to Mr. Theodore will
be chosen this week.”
It you can take the ignorant and vicious
(Who’ve all got votes), ami get yourself returned
To office on a “programme” meretricious
Which prudent men consistently have spurned ;
If you can bound about with great resilience
From principle to what's next door to crime,
And skite, and tax, and chuck about more millions,
Wrung from taxpayers working overtime;
If you can rally all the fools and rotters,
With some small sprinkling of good men bemused,
By talking most mendaciously of “squatters”
And “money kings” who’ve loans to you refused ;
If you can paint your dupes an El Dorado,
A heaven on earth (of course, you easily can),
And meet all deprecation with bravado,
Or sheer denial, even, for a span ;
If you can find an acquiescent Speaker,
If you can get a servile Cabinet,
If you can make the Opposition meeker
(Though one more timid would be hard to get) ;
If you can llont the people’s wishes daily ;
If you can bully and degrade the Crown,
And pass a score of one-class measures gaily
Produced like sausages by some deft clown;
If you can pose as most unkindly injured
By criticisms in the “Tory” press;
II you can get your Caucus fainthearts gingered,
And make them bellow “No!” instead of “Yes!”
If you can waste, and borrow, spend and squander,
If you can set up “boards” and "trusts” and
“pools,”
And daily of monopolies grow fender,
And lay them on the necks of gaping fools;
If you can brave all custom and convention,
And roughshod ride over fair precedent ;
If you can model guttersnipe intention
Into bad laws, nor heed the loud dissent
That rises from a State enraged and plundered,
And apprehensive still of something more;
You’ll be —well, now, has anybody wondered?—
A proper man to follow Theodore.

“Spare Corp” : Apropos people feeling sen-
sation in a limb that has gone, I met a queer
THAT WOULD PROVE IT.
“If you turn me down I'll do something dashed silly.”
“Oh, do blow out your brains, and then we won't have to argue
any more about whether you've got any."
instance. I was sitting in a London restau-
rant with a Digger who had had .an arti-
ficial leg fitted to the stump left him after
Passchendaele, when a plate fell from the
table and hit sharply on the dummy shin.
Quick as thought his hand went down to
nurse the spot, and a spasm of pain flitted
over his face. He told me he actually felt
the blow just as if his had been a real meat
and bone leg; and for a couple of days
afterwards he had an extra limp in his
artificial limb.
“Towser”: I know a bit about the bush
kid, and the more I know the more wonder-
ful lie seems. I was sent to mend a pump
at a well in the N.T. 100 miles over the
Queensland border and found it in charge
of two children, a girl of 10 and a
boy of 8. They were the station-
owner’s infants, and were camped 40 miles
from anywhere. Tlieir fare consisted of
salt beef and damper. I was the first person
thev had seen for a fortnight, and all that
interested them was whether or not I could
mend the pump so they could resume then
work. They took their loneliness so much
as a matter of course that when I had
finished they said so-long to me with complete
unconcern.

“M.E.D.”: Some years ago, when I was a
timid little probationer doing night-duty in a
C.Q. hospital, an old boundary-rider was
sent in from one of the stations for medical
treatment. He arrived in the middle of the
night, and, after relieving him of a soiled
khaki coat and a flannel shirt, I began to
feel a trifle embarrassed at the sight of some
really exquisite lace. Further investiga-
tions revealed underclothing dainty enough
for any bride’s trousseau. The story which
we subsequently heard was that the old chap,
deprived for years of feminine society, had
found some solace in arraying himself in
lingerie and contemplating himself admiringly
in this disguise. He died intestate, and.
there being none to claim his effects, most ot
his old clothes were burped, and the rest of
his wardrobe utilised as dusters, floorcloths,
etc. It is the only time I have ever seen
hospital floorcloths trimmed with torchon.

“Sixenate”: A nomad of a new brand has
cropped up in a Melbourne liquor prosecu-
tion. He kept a bedroom engaged at three
hotels, and apparently slept in. whichever
happened to be nearest when he felt tired.
One, near the garage which supplied him
with a living, was useful if work kept him
late; another was in the pub where he
had most of his meals and sometimes liked
to rest after dinner; and the third was his
normal sleeping-place. The police, catching
one of the publicans serving the nomadic
person with drink after hours, claimed that
no man could be a lodger in three places at
once, but his Worship decided that there
were no grounds for conviction.

“C.”:, The aesthetic Hardy Wilson lias
recorded' his opinion that Lady Franklin's
Museum, the small
white model of a
Greek temple in
the Leriah Valley
(Hobart), is the
most beautiful
building in the
island. Erected in
1842, on an estate
of 500 acres, by
the bounty of Lady
Franklin, the syl-
van spot was ori-
ginally intended as
a retreat for over-
worked Ministers
of the Crown and
the centre of a
native arboretum.
At present it is
neither. _Tli e
museum, built of
sands t o n e, in
classic style, is
used as an apple-
packing shed ; the
grounds have be-
come a neglected
wilderness. But
the Leriah Valley
people, stung at
last to action by
taunts about the
place, have evolved
a progress associa-
tion which now
puts in its Satur-
day afternoons
s t raightening
things. Money is
also being raised
to restore the
museum, which
may yet become a
thing for Hobart
to be proud of. in-
stead of a disgrace.

“T.P.” : Just an-
other illustration of
the pluck of coun-
try women. Mrs.
John Murphy,
alone at her place in Cai-boor (Vic.), was
bitten on the leg by a snake. At once she
fixed a ligature, cut in deep with a razor,
used Condy’s crystals, walked a mile to a
doctor, and is now quite well, thank you.

“Hamer”: The prestige of a Melbourne
dog which, letter perfect in its part of the
faithful hound, dragged an escaping thief
from his bicycle and was mainly responsible
for his capture, is being threatened by a
Melbourne cat. The pampered feline, whose
kittens were in the basket stage, was percheu
on a high palm-pedestal near a ground-floor
window proudly regarding its offspring when
the burglar arrived. As he cautiously raised
the window and began to climb furtively
through, the cat decided that he had fell
designs on her family and leapt for his head.
A man who lurched blindly about a quiet
suburban garden trying to disentangle nim-
self from a cat that was digging its claws
into his scalp, was an easy haul for a passing
John Hop, who found on his captive sufficient
evidence in the form of house-breaking imple-
ments to secure a conviction.
BREAKING THE NEWS.
"Dad, do you mind if I attend a wedding to-morrow?"
“Must you?"
“Well, I think they'd like me to. I'm the bride.”
“C.S.” : Ail almost revolutionary talc, which
attracted hardly any credence the other day,
was to the effect that the Pope would emerge
from seclusion and enlarge his personal know-
ledge by a world tour. No doubt it is the
sort of event which will have to take place
some day, yet even at this hour it sounds
wildly improbable. For 55 years the Popes
have lived the indoor life, much as the Sultans
used to do. Pius IX. toured his dominions
once or twice, but in 1870 he ceased
to have dominions. Previously, in 1848, he
made a few-months’ trip to Gaeta, in Naples,
because his subjects proposed to hang him and
abolish his sacred office. Foreign troops
brought him back. Two Popes at the beginning
of the nineteenth century had a run to 1 ranee,
one being dragged thither by the Directory
and one by Napoleon. The first (Pius A I.)
died in France. He also, before his troubles
began, visited Vienna. But touring subse-
quent to their consecration was a diminishing
habit among Popes after the return from the
long exile at Avignon. And when, on the
death of Adrian, the Dutchman, 402 years
ago, it became an unwritten law that none
but Italians should occupy the chair of bt.
Peter the possible candidates became a very
much less travelled lot than formerly.
Whether the partial removal of the veil of
mystery would strengthen the hold of the
Church on its following, or whether proximity
would lend disenchantment to the view, it is
difficult to say. Probably a good deal would
depend upon the sort of press agent it had.

“G. 5.8.”: The parsimony of the Defence
Department and the ingenuity of a retired
naval commander are responsible for one of
the funniest little railways in the world. On
the shores of Port Phillip (exactly where
is. of course, a profound secret) is a little
workshop devoted to the “reconditioning and
overhaul of mines.” A line of light rails
connects the shop with the nearest town,
three miles away, but the fupds are not suffi-
cient to supply any rolling-stock. The com-
mander was, however, provided with a very
ancient Ford car, with which. he was ex-
pected to convey all stores to his depot, and
also some 30 workmen to and from their
Work. So he built bogeys to run on the line,
perched his Ford on top of them, and man.-
aged with drawing chains to link up the
driving-axle of his ’bus with the wheels of
the bogey. Then he built two trailers, and
the good old Ford runs as a miniature ex-
press on lines laid for a railway-engine. The
same commander was allowed to purchase
an obsolete submarine for £2OOO. He dis-
mantled and sold enough of its fittings to
pay back the £2OOO, and out of the remnants
gradually built up an electric-lighting plant
for his “island.” sundry machines for his
shop, and many ingenious little bits of plant
which headquarters were too poor to supply.
You can’t repress an old sea-engineer by re-
fusing to honor liis requisitions for plant
so long as there is a heap of scrap steel
about.
“Feng-Shui”: Geo. B. Duff, secretary of
the N.S.W. branch of the R.S.P.C.A., is
furious over the cruelties inflicted on wild
animals hunted for their fur in the Arctic
Circle. It is hard to say where the line should be
drawn. Mr. Duff, if he eschews meat, no doubt
eats salads, and so helps to give pain to
lettuces and Brussels sprouts, which my
friend Mohammed Sa’aid says have souls and
just as tender feelings as dogs and horses.
He doubtless also wears boots made of leather
that once grew on a dumb animal. In
summer he wears cotton singlets, and robs
the boll-weevil of its natural sustenance.
Owing to Australian neglect of a great
market tlie cotton-clad masses of China can-
not afford to buy winter wool, and are forced
to wear fur. They wear it inside out for
greater warmth. In the wonderful Street ot
Furs in Hankow, the great depot of the
Siberian trade, I have seen poor peasants
cheapening beautiful pelts that would make
an Australian woman pop-eyed with envy
and admiration. The smallest clerk can just
afford to wear a waistcoat lined inside with
fur. Fur is as essential to the Russian
moujik as silk socks to a Sydney shop-girl.
If Mr. Duff succeeds in making Australian
women abandon the wcai’ing of furs, it may
be good for their health, but it will not
diminish the sufferings of polar bears and
arctic foxes. It will only make furs a little
cheaper in Asia and enable more coolies to
wear them.

“Nikko”: A topsy-turvy version of the
old tale of the small boy who announced that
he had seen a lion in the back yard was heard
in M.L. the other day, when a Hawera

urchin reported the presence of an out-size
dog in the rear premises. Some commotion
caused his mother to investigate, and she was
horrified to discover a young lion in posses-
sion of the vegetable garden. Several
keepers from a circus arrived to capture the
animal, which, after putting up a great
fight, was overcome by a carpet and held
down by 10 men. But for the fact that the
beast was mainly occupied in evading capture
the end of the small boy might have been
sudden and sticky.

BALLADE OF THE VANISHED STEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Giving evidence before the Food Prices Commis-
sion, a railwayman’s wife said that before the war
working-men had been content with stews, but nowa-
days they demanded roasts, steak and chops.’ —Cable.
The sirloin sizzles in juices red,
On the gridiron hisses the mutton chop ;
The son of Martha is better fed
(And the till scoops more at the butcher’s shop).
He may sigh as he gulpeth his malt and hop
For the vanished kick of the pre-war beer,
The stuff with less of the foam atop—
But where are the stews of yesteryear?
The butcher stands where his stock is spread,
But of odds and ends he has less to lop ;
His keen knife slices the steak instead.
On the juicy rib does his cleaver drop.
There is fillet, too, when the rump shall stop,
The haunch and shoulder are severed clear,
And he has no fear that the price will flop—
But where are the stews of yesteryear?
Where are the legions the Kaiser led?
Where is the throne they were used to prop?
Where are the crowns be-diamonded
From sleek heads swept by the Bolshie mop?
Some in storage and some in pop ?
Where did the Sultan disappear?
Where is the threepenny razor strop?
But where are the stews of yesteryear?
Envoy.
Compensations, when all is said,
Come to soften afflictions drear.
What though the sixpenny nip has fled?
But where are the stews of yesteryear?

“Billy See”: In the olden golden days,
when bits of Coolgardie (W.A.) and other
goldfields towns were always going up in
smoke, the warning “Look out for the
dynamite!” never failed to stampede the
crowd. But no one was ever killed or
even injured by such fire explosions; it re-
mained for these present prosaic times to
provide such a tragedy. The night of Feb.
(» saw a Bailey-street butcher’s shop in
flames, and the “Old Camp’s” few remain-
ing inhabitants gathered to the spectacle.
Suddenly the ammonia tank attached to a
small freezing-plant burst and came hurtling
through the flames. Three men and a
woman were in its path, and it literally
tore them to pieces, the lightest individual
injury being a leg torn right off. The
woman and two men died within a few hours.

“Oxrnead” : The most notable characteristic
of the enterprising Australians who periodi-
cally set out for London to claim the millions
that some shadowy ancestor left in Chancery
is that they can seldom carry their own pedi-
gree back with any certainty for more than
two or three generations. Which is, per-
haps, one reason why they never get a sniff
at the huge masses of wealth they invariably
express themselves so sanguine of handling.
Probably the average Australian knows as
much of his forebears as the average Lon-
doner, but the exceeding vagueness of most
of these claimants makes one wonder if the
Family Bible has gone quite out of fashion
as a private registry of births, deaths and
marriages. In rural England, when I was

THE ORACLE : “Well, I’ve never found it very successful with

a hoy, it was still a common and authentic
record of the possessor's pedigree, or as much
thereof as could he crowded into the few
blank pages at the front. The Boer farmer, as
was borne in on us in 1902 and following
years, found it indispensable for precisely
similar purposes. Don't any of the people
who are always rising up to claijn Fazacker-
ley's millions or similar ownerless wads ever
have Family Bibles or know any of their kin
who may have been possessed of such? Or
is it one of the inevitable and baneful results
of the churches’ weakening grip—so often
deplored by the churches themselves —upon
erring humanity that the ponderous old
Family Bible of other days stands no more
where it did? Anyway, it is a pity.
Whatever its merits as an instrument of
salvation, it had a supremely practical use
bn the genealogical side.
“Akran”: The night before Guedecourt
our company engaged in their favorite
pastime, two-up. One chap got the
lot. He was in my platoon, and just
before our toes hit the sandbags to hop
oyer I asked him what he had inside
his tunic. “Francs,” he said, “two
thousand. I’m looking for leave when
I come out.” He never came out. I
have sometimes wondered whether his
winnings were buried with him, or if
some stretcher-bearer or grave-digger
collected the material for a ’day or two in
I’aris.

“Hasen”: The ship's doctor was beginning
to wear a harassed look long before we
reached Hongkong. There was no illness on
board to explain it, but there were two lady-
missionaries of an unpleasantly ardent type.
On their way to the heathen of “the East”
they tried tlieir hand on those of the ship,
with discouraging results until they fastened
doggedly on the doc., he being slow to take
offence and not good at discouraging. At
Sandakan, though, he all but revolted. Re-
turning from risking (and losing) his modest
pound at the fan-tan school, he was con-
fronted by the bigger and more ardent of the
two. “Ah, Doctor,” she hurled at him, “what
shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world and lose his own spill?” The doctor
made no reply, but his chance came a few
days later when the strong-minded lady be-
sought him pathetically for advice on the
settling of a most unruly stomach. The old
Adam awoke in him then as he thought of
past discomforts, and of how the whole of
the ship’s company had run before her. “Ah,
madam,” he said earnestly, “what shall it
profit a woman if she gain the whole deck
and lose her dinner?” And he departed with
dignity.
“Weka”: I heard
a man complaining
the other day of
the reluctance of
motorists to pick
up travellers on
country roads. Yet
this hesitancy is
sometimes jud i-
eious. Last year I
was driving along
a lonely road near
Taupo (M.L.) and
overtook a dust-
grimed individual
equipped with
bluey and a thick
ti-tree wal k i n g-
stick. lie accepted
iny offer of a lift
gratefully, and told
ine he was a motor-
mechanic down on
his luck, tramping
to Wellington to
look for work. He
seemed a decent,
intelligent young
fellow, an d w e
chatted about many
things. “That’s a
great view over
there,” he said sud-
denly, and as I
turned to look his
stick descended on
my head. Luckily
flic blow was a
glancing one, and
I was able to stop
the car and seize
him. We had a
great go for a few
seconds: then I
managed to toss
him overboard. 1
was slightly dazed,
the upholstery of
the car was
scratched and torn,
an d the wind-
screen was cracked.
Still, I was lucky:
had the struggle
ended otherwise I
have no doubt he
would have run the
car td a .secluded
spot and dismantled
and sold every-
thing removable. Since then I have been in-
clined to let the weary wayfarer walk.
“Cartot’’: From his list of countries in
which in mediaeval times animals were pun-
ished by process of law for their misdeeds,
“A.H.H.” (B. 12/2/’25) omits England.
There, as late as the fifteenth century, a wolf
was solemnly tried and executed at Lincoln
for killing a child, and its body was hung
in chains from a gibbet after the carrying
out of the sentence. The custom might
have originated in the Hebraic codes, but in
later ages if got most of its strength from
Papal edicts arid denunciations.
“C.G.C." : The abolition of the ornamen-
tal case that sur-
rounds the piano’s
inna r d s (B.
22/l/’25) would
deprive many a
household of a
handy receptacle
for odds and ends.
In my capacity as
tuner I was re-
cently called in to
dissect a valuable
instrument in Cen-
tr a 1 Queensland.
From its interior I
retrieved, am o n g
other things, half a
bottle of pickles,
several banana-
skins, an old pair
of socks and some
ancient fish-bones.

Macann”: Coincidence was a commonplace
at the war, but it never stretched its long
arm much further than the day it reached
out and found me sitting in an ambulance-
car, which the Horseferry-road authorities
had sent to gather up the night’s takings
from the various gaols of London. I had
spent the night in a cell in Vine-street for
the heinous offence of being caught in London
without a, pass. Most of the little party
had sore heads, and there wasn’t much con-
versation till one veteran who looked 16
hut reckoned he was two years older an-
nounced that he thought that was a nice
crimson way to be spending his birthday.
“Well. that’s darned funny,” another
drawled, “it’s my flamin’ birthday, too.” He
was 19. I thought they would put me down
as a liar if I advanced a similar claim, so
I kept quiet. Yet I was also on a birthday
anniversary. In my case, however, I was
old enough to know better; I was 20.

“Quack”: “Excuse me, sir,” said the
American passenger, breaking in on Jowett
and his friend talking by the ship’s rail. “I
just nat’rally had ter butt in on your little
symposium when you mentioned the word
‘system.’ ” Jowett was a mild little, man and
looked startled. "When you said that word.
Mister,” went on the man who looked like a
million dollars, “you said a mouthful. Believe
me, sir. system is the cat’s whole trousseau.
It’s both ends and the middle, the soul and the
guts of all business. It’s” “But”
began Mr. Jowett mildly. “There’s no ’but’
about it, sir. Henry Ford knew it, and what
did he do? Rockbilt, Vanderfeller, all the
groat men of the day realised that system was
everything. Ask me to what I owe my suc-
cess !” Mr. Jowett did not do so.
Instead, he began again. “But” “I
answer you in one word. System, sir.
System is the one best bet, the keystone in the
arch, the yeast in the dough, the juice in the
machine, the gas in the balloon, the”
“But” said Mr. Jowett. “It requires no
words of mine, sir,” the other cut in. “With-

Jowett more firmly, “we were talking of a

“Harold Ilardupp”: Melbourne police have
received inquiries from a lady in Canada who
wants them to trace her son. Four years
ago he was “employed on a sheep ranch at
Melbourne, Australia.” There is a suspicion
that this is the man who. living in a lonely
hut on the outskirts of Toorak station, used
to ride in to the post office twice a month
on his roan mustang, swimming his horse
over the river in preference to going round
by the ford near Richmond. Ilis red shirt
and cowboy breeches made him a picturesque
figure, while the ornament at his belt gave
the impression that he was a two-handed
gunman, a view further supported by his
habit of asking for letters from Canada or
the TJ.S.A. If this is the man inquired
about he probably set out for the recent
gold rush at Fitzroy, and there are dismal
conjectures that he may have either been
waylaid by blacks or lost his way in the
bush at Exhibition Park and perished miser-
ably.

“Boori” : The most versatile parson of all
once ministered in a suburb of our city.

down the wrath of the brotherhood, and he
was pushed out. Loath to leave a locality
so much to his liking, he set up as auc-
tioneer, etc. The unreasoning prejudice of
the church folk made the venture a dud. He
then took on odd jobs as rent collector,
bailiff, etc., and finally figured as private
detective in a divorce suit. The enterprise
and originality he put into that case caused
the defending counsel to counter by digging
up some of his past. Before coming our
way he had been a John Hop: his previous
history in the Old Dart remained a blank.
CASTE DIFFERENCES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]

The frills of life, inquiring maid,
Make life’s ranks strangely tangled
Vulgarity, I am afraid,
Is “style,” when starched and mangled.
Old titles sadly are misused,
Corrupted in their meaning:
The eagle’s greatness is confused
With peacocks, feathers preening.
There’s many a man with manhood small
But manners of a Stanley
Who scarcely is a man at all,
He is so gentlemanly;
Whilst others, who have chanced to pen
The cash that now is vital,
Are neither gentlemen nor men,
And yet receive each title.
No sow’s ear can a silk purse make,
Yet money (though by shady
Means it was won) a sow can take,
It seems, and make a lady!
’Tis oft the slavey-soul would be
A lady silked and scented ;
But loftier in her heart is she
Who “woman” makes contented.
Dear Mary Ann, ’tis such as she
Frets not about her label.
And lets each other woman be
A lady—if she’s able.
But, as the cringing fashion goes,
’Tis woman makes the lady—
The woman meek who makes the clothe*
To drape plain Jude O’Grady!
Just silk and frills, when all is clone—
A thing that’s scarcely human.
A “lady’s” very often one
Who's ceased to be a woman!

Along with the writing-down of capital the
directors record a profit more than three
times the average of the previous 10 years.
Shareholders have had a long wait for a de-
cent return. For the 10 years to l.H)_ they
got only 5 p.c. in divs. and in the next lo
years the average was under 4 p.c. Ibe
table takes tip the story at that stage. High
prices for wool were partly the cause of
last year’s splendid return. “Partly, be-
cause' the co.’s stations, Bundaleer and
Tliurulgoona are in the far south-west of
Queensland, where the weather is fickle, and
where blowflies and wild dogs vie with rabbits
in attempts to displace the jumbuck. Record
prices at the sales would, therefore, have
been of little use if other conditions had
been unfavorable. However, there wns a con-
spiracy among the co.’s good fairies: rain
fell at the right times over the co.’s prin-
cipality of 101 S square miles (it was 25 p.c.
larger at one time, but some of its holdings
were resumed by the Government), and though
dingoes and ’flies did more damage than they
should, there was plenty of grass throughout
the term. The clip was 1877 bales greasy
and 137 scoured, all but 27 bales of greasy
having been sold. At December 31 the num-
ber of sheep on the runs was 75,000, still
on the low side compared with the 107.701 of
1013 and the 142.030 of 1007. The £50.976
of profit was equal to 41 p.c. on the written-
down capital after £6BBO was struck off for
depreciation and £17,731 set aside for taxa-
tion.
Even the poor distributions shown in the
table are not all they look, for part has been
counted as return of capital. From 1012
to 1023 17s. had been so handed back, and
of last year’s distribution of os., 5s is labelled
bonus. In 1013 the Board announced that
when the bonuses amounted to 10s. per share
capital would be, reduced. .East year the
Court granted the co. permission to write
off the uncalled 10s., reduce capital by half
and alter the denomination of the shares.
This has been done, and the 07,335 shares
at £3 10s. (paid to £3) have been written
down to 30s. The amount of the reduction
was £146.002. and the adjustment is made
by writing that much off the book value of
leases. These have gone from £224,506 to
£72,977; during the year an additional pro-
vision of £5617 net for wastage of leases and
depreciation of improvements was made.
Balance-sheet movements reflect the writing-
down of capital and the phenomenal wool
position :

The directors report that no credit has been
taken for the 8038 shares held in
8.A.W.R.A., but income benefited by the
9s. per share paid during the year. As
Bawra shares are quoted at 11s. 4d. there
is a reserve in that. Then for the 75,000
sheep and other stock to be given a book
value of £45,230 is an insult to King .Turn-
buck. Allowing for liabilities, liquids and
livestock at December 31 amounted to
£154.017. sufficient to pay back tbe present
capital (30s. per share) and leave £8915,
plus stations, plant and improvements. That
sounds promising. But it must be remem-
bered that, although shares have been writ-
ten down 305., shareholders had not been
returned the full amount written off, and
their divs. have been very small. Further,
the leases have only another 10 years to
run, and there is no guarantee of renewal.
If renewals are not granted the co. will, of
course, have tenant rights in the improve-
ments, but their value under those circum-
stances is a matter of guesswork. Imme-
diate prospects arc good. Since the close
of the accounts eight inches of rain is re-
ported, and the wool market remains firm.
In the Wild Cat’s opinion merino prices will
not stay where they are, because smaller
quantities of high-grade clip will be used.
But the social revolution which has been
takin 0, place in the world has added millions
to the buyers of from fair to good woollens,
so that Australia is not ikely to have to
sell its clip at anything like the low prices
which it has sometimes had to accept.

Last year Victoria Malay’s loan from the
Planters’ Loan Board was reduced from
£8983 to £6l§8 —a good bite ; and since tljtc
close of the accounts a further £lO5O lips
been paid off.
When the co. was formed rubber was worth
nearly ss. per lb. Last year the average
price got by this co. was 12.66 d. To-day
best plantation is 174 d.. and that price is
maintained only by a drastic reduction of
output. With costs at 10.70 d. per lb.
(10.81 d. in 1023) there is not much in a
yield of 159,0001 b. The market is a little
stronger, and may move even higher,
thanks to the influence on demand of motor-
balloon tyres. But the restriction on pro-
duction is heavy: most plantations have
limited their tapping to 60 p.c. of the “stand-
ard yield,” and for the last two months of
this co.’s financial year it was as little as
55 p.c. The existence of this dammed-up
flood of rubber makes any rapid and sus-
tained increase of price unlikely. The best
hope for a slow but steady improvement lies
in the fact that the world’s stocks are now
small; and it is mainly in this hope that Vic-
toria Malay and other plantations are kept
in order.
Incidentally, the ordinance restricting rub-
ber output in Malaya has had some queer re-
sults. The stuff is almost as well worth
smuggling out as opium is worth smuggling in.
A big service of speed motor-boats is main-
tained to stop the traffic, and punishments
imposed on native contrabanders are savage,
fines of 5000 dollars or six months’ imprison-
ment being common. Most of the stuff comes
from the small planter, who complains that he
has been squeezed out of busines so that big
companies shall make “large profits.” Cer-
tianly the price has been pushed up; the
sales in the second year of the restriction
were 84.000,000 dollars (Malay) more than
in the previous year. Meantime, as the world
is calling for rubber and more rubber, and
as the Straits cannot control the output of the
whole earth, suitable countries like the Philip-
pines are planting rubber-trees as fast as
they can.

That is the lowest div. rate, and, in propor-
tion to capital, the lowest profit since 1909.
Causes? Keen competition in the milk and
ice business, and slackness in cold-storage
owing to dulness in the meat-export trade,
according to the report. And. perhaps, lack
of real summer weather in Sydney helped.
The mild weather this spring and summer
(accounts are to January 1) has brought
many of the smaller ice-makers to despera-
tion, and the F., F. and I. was also affected
in the demand for ice-cream and milk. A
dry spell in the dairying areas or a cold
spell in the metropolis each carries a kick
for this co. In 1923 it found its additional
ice-making machinery working at pressure to
meet the demand. Last year the old plant
would have been sufficient. Since the higlily-
successful 1919 term the divs. have not been
earned by £025; and the Board did well to
reduce the div. rate to 6 p.c., even though
reserves are fairly substantial. The outlook
is not such as to inspire prodigality: the
meat-export trade shows no sign of brighten-
ing; competition in milk will continue keen,
and the increasing number of small manu-
facturers of ice will mean severe competi-
tion in that line. Last year the co. held its
business, and doubtless will continue to do
so. but the competition does not help profits.
The co. is at present erecting a new building
which is to be equipped with modern milk-
handling plant. This will call for more
capital, so shareholders will be asked for
the 2s. unpaid on each of the 282.091 shares.
Balance-sheet movements were in the right
direction :
1915. 1920. 1923. 1924.

Hook debts. . .. 31,324 67,343 58,718 52,985
Property and plant moved down £12,842.
This was due chiefly to resumption of the
no.’s wharf, swallowed up in the reclamation
of Darling Harbor. The amount got from
the Railway Commissioners was written oft
leaseholds ; it helped to reduce the overdraft by
£5757 and other liabilities by £9511. Invest-
ments expanded £(5034, making the liquids
£34,497 in excess of all outside liabilities.
Shareholders have had a good average return
over the past 14 years, but the capitalisation
of £73.384 of reserves in 1912 and 1914 was
merely replacement of capital written off in
1904.' Capital at January 1 was £253.882;
when the 2s. is got. in it will be £282,091,
which will call for nearly £30,000 to pay
a 10 p.c. div. Certainly the co. has done
better than that, on less than half the capi-
tal ; but competition is keener, and costs are
heavier these days; so the scrip isn’t as at-
tractive as it was.

The unpatriotic policy which has left some
of Australia’s greatest harbors to be the play-
grounds of a few fishing-smacks while Syd-
ney’s traffic is more and more crowded lias
brought grist to the mills of firms like
Richardson and Wrench. Under the in-
fluence of this policy and Government bor-
rowing some amazing figures were shown in
1920; and although the tide has run out a
little since then, real-estate transactions
are still very heavy :

Richardson and Wrench maintained their
lead by accounting for £1,004,238 in com-
pleted sales for the year, and that was ex-
clusive of £235,000 worth of Gas shares.
Gross earnings, commissions and interest
were nevertheless a shade less than in the
previous year. llere are comparisons :

The position from other viewpoints is shown
in this comparison of balance-sheet figures:

Odds and ends .. 1,861 3,222 4,823 3,897
The contraction in capital is accounted for
by the return of £17.412 in 1923. The posi-
tion is very comfortable; after providing for
all liabilities and the final div., the balance
of assets was equal to 20s. 6d. for each 15s.
share. Though earnings cannot be expected
to stay up where they have been during the
past three years, the immediate future looks
very bright. Sydney is going to have a lot
of money to spend during the next 12 months.

Seeing how things were shaping in July, the
directors went to the Commission created
by the Gas Act and, being able to show that
by reason of high costs the co. could not
pay the standard 8 p.c., got permission to
put up the price from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 3d. But
the rise didn’t come early enough to quite
save the situation; so, though only £2OOO
Was extracted from revenue for the “special
purposes and depreciation fund,” as against
£4500 or so permitted by the Act, profits were
still less than the 8 p.c. div. called for. The
position is, however, a bit better than you
might judge from that; for during the year
a good deal of main extension was done, and
that isn’t instantly profitable, as a rule:
anyway, there is always some money dead
while such jobs are in progress. Even so,
there is nothing very attractive now about
these N.S.W. gas investments. It is true
that the law allows the cos. to put up prices
when they can show that they can’t pay 8
p.c. at the old rates; hut that doesn’t mean
that 8 p.c. is guaranteed. The time may
come when in order to compete with elec-
tricity a N.S.W. gas co. may accept a price
which won’t return more than 6 p.c. In
Tasmania, for instance, the Launceston co.,
having to meet keen electric competition, for
many years dared not charge more than
wonid return it 4 p.c. Further, nothing is
to be hoped for from bonus issues or even
from issues at par: if more capital is wanted
the shares have to be offered at auction —
20,000 in this co. were sold during the year
at a shade over par. Subject to the fore-
going remarks the outlook here is satisfac-
tory. There is only one Manly, and its
extension along one of the most beautiful
coastlines in the world is assured. The
directors have it in mind to take their
mains further afield; but there is no incen-
tive to do anything speculative in this way.
The Gas Act has the very best intentions;
but it practically stops divs. at 8 p.c. Direc-
tors certainly can’t look for a reasonably
quick 10 or 12 p.c. in return for taking risks.
If the extensions don’t pay 8 p.c., then cer-
tainly the price may be put up all round;
but, as remarked already, it is one thing
to put up a price and another to get busi-
ness at the higher rate.
Though in the circumstances it isn’t of
much practical value, a comparison is added
showing for purposes of record how various
items of the co.’s accounts have behaved since

G. G. Goode. Ltd. (Melbourne) : —The
original co. was Sniders and Abrahams Trop .
Ltd. This firm was well established and its
lines of tobacco were known throughout the
Commonwealth when, in 1919, expanding
business sent it to the public for pref. capi-
tal— £40,000 of S p.c. cum. The old pro-
prietors took all the ordinaries in the new
co., 124,902 fully-paid of 10s. each being
issued for the assets, which included £5204
for goodwill. As the profits for previous
years had averaged £7401 the prefs. were
taken readily. The first balance-sheet, which
covered a period of 11 months, more than
justified the prospectus: despite various ad-
verse factors, the net profit was £11,379.
Ordinaries got a 121 p.c. div. Then came
slump. In 1921 operations resulted in 0
loss of £27,178. The ordinary shareholders did
the decent thing by surrendering half then-
capital. The 1922 balance showed another
l oss —£22,679. Then the Board found that
there had been factors other than the post-
war slump in values; management had not
been all it should have been, and the leaf
purchased had been irregular in quality.
There was re-organisation; old plant was
scrapped, and the business, which previously
had been in three or four factories, was con-
centrated under one roof. The 12 months
ended June 30, 1923. showed the effect of
re-organisation, only £1331 being added to the
debit at Profit and Loss, which then stood at

£24.524. The promise was not fulfilled
iu the following year, which showed a loss
of £9896; but a recovery was made in the
second half of 1924. Here is the position
before that happened, with a comparison
back to the first year of the co.: —

corner seems to have been turned in
the last half-year. A profit of £1216 was
disclosed after provision had been made for
depreciation, bad debts and loss on realisa-
tions. The overdraft was reduced from
£3:1,794 to £21,118, but that was contributed
to largely by a redaction of £10,524 in stocks.
The Board expects even better results from a
removal to suburban premises. The change
was made at the close of December, so
the effect does not. show in the accounts for
tlie six months. Iu October last “prelimin-
ary conversations” took place regarding a
merger with the Tobacco Trust, but the direc-
tors report that “no mutually satisfactory
basis was found possible, so the proposal was
abandoned for tin 1 present.” The last three
words sound hopeful.
With liquids and semi-liquids at £61.613,
creditors had no need for concern : liabilities,
including an overdraft of £21,118 secured by
a debenture, amounted to £35,376. The
balance of liquids, plus plant (which wouldn’t
be worth much, of course, if the co. had to
stop using it), represents almost 19s. per £1
of pref. capital. Meantime (including good-
will, £5204) the deficit is a little less than
£33,203; but pref. divs. have been banking
up at the rate of £3200 p.a. Which suggests
that, unless there is remarkable promise in
near-future prospects, the ordinary capital
could again be written down by half (from
ss. to 2s. 6d. a share) with advantage, and
the goodwill item wiped out of the books.
Pref. holders have been querulous for some
time, but the co. appears to have a fighting
chance of repeating its earlier records.

The promoters of Australian Oil Invest-
ments, Ltd., naturally think better of their
scheme than the Wild Gat did (B. 5/2/’25).
Their authorised capital is 500.000 in £lO
shares. They offer 25,000 shares for subscrip-
tion and take 1000. The whole £lO per share
is to be paid within four months of allot-
ment. Of the subscribed capital 90l p.c. is
to be held on trust for seven years, or
until, within that period, the co. decides that
payable oil or mineral has been struck: in
that case the 90 p.c. becomes available for
the purposes of the co. The co. must, there-
fore, do all its exploring on DO p.c. of the
capital put up, plus the interest on the 90
p.c. But as brokerage is “not to exceed 5
p.c.,” and as “an amount not exceeding 10
p.c. of the capital actually subscribed” may
be taken “to provide for preliminary and
flotation exes., brokerage and the means to
commence drilling operations,” it is pretty
certain that, for the actual work of the co.,
the co. will have to depend upon what the
90 p.c. of capital can earn in the way of
interest. “One of the objects is to repay
shareholders the whole of the subscribed
capital without interest if at the end of
seven years no success has attended the
efforts of the co. to find a payable quantity
of 0i1.,..0r any* minerals or metals.” It is
a very praiseworthy object. But why
should the public be asked to put up so
much more money than the exploration is
going to cost V A comparatively small pros-
pecting co. would answer all the co. s pur-
poses : given a successful search, there
would be no difficulty in getting the capital
to carry on. To ask people to hand over
tlie control of their capital! so that part of
the interest on it may be used, for prospect-
ing. is a fantastic scheme. And it is more
fantastic because the promoters take 1 p.c.
of the capital subscribed, along with the
1000 shares abovementioned. It is like
forming a co. to buy a steam-hammer to
crock nuts, the promoter to get 1 p.c. com-
mission on the cost of the machine.

E. J. Gourley. one of Kalgoorlie’s inspec-
tors of mines, after an annual look at the
few remaining mines there, reports thus: —
Great Boulder: Operations during 1924 opened up
fair ore in places, but stupes of main reef are
gradually being depleted and the average grade of
the mine is still falling. In the co.’s recently
acquired Hannan’s North mines at the north end of
the field a good quantity of payable ore has been
opened up at and below 600 ft.
Boulder Perseverance: Some tributors have done
very well in the past, but latterly the grade of the
orfe mined has come down considerably. Still
the property, Which is 60 p.c. tributed and 40 p.c.
mined by the co., appears to have a long and
profitable life ahead of it.
Associated Gold Mines; Ore shoots very short
and mostly low grade. So far the rich ore worked
by South Kalgurli almost up to the Associated
boundary has eluded discovery.
South Kalgurli: Large reserves of ore, both rich
and poor, were opened up in 1924: Co. has installed
electrically-driven plant, 'and steam, except for
winders, will soon be done without.
Oroya Links Group: Mostly tributed. This co. is
treating oxidised ore with varying results at Brown-
hill, stoping low-grade ore in Croesus Proprietary
section and working out east at the 400 ft. an 1
800 ft. levels of the Kalgurli to pick up the con-
tinuation of the Associated lodes. Some of the
tributors on this co.’s mines have done well.
Golden Horseshoe: Now driving south at 3320 ft.
in low-grade ore, but values may improve at any
time. Grade of ore opened up during the past year
in other parts of the mine—chiefly between 2800 it.
and 3320 ft. levels —although not high, has been
fairly consistent.
Lake View— Star—Chaffer’s—lvanhoe: Recent de-
velopment has been chiefly done in the Lake \ ie-.v
section of this group; and as leading stopes are
being taken off and ore sent to the mill, results have
apparently been satisfactory. Chaffer’s is entirely
manned by tribytors, some of whom have done
well. Star’s main workings are being unwatercd
and a few contract parties are breaking ore in this
block. Chaffer’s mill is being duplicated in antici-
pation of considerable supplies being drawn from
the Ivanhoe in the near future.

Devon Co. (W.A.) has got hold of another
optimist. Again and again shareholders
have been told by “new managers’ that pre-
vious failures were due to mismanagement
and that they could count on divs. in the
future. But, alas! instead of_ receiving
they have had to give. Now another “new
manager” has promised that, “provided ore
as good as that extracted in the past can be
obtained in the future, operations must
show a considerable profit.” He adds that
but for the inexperience of his predecessors
the mine would have been a dividend payer
for years. On the strength of this boost and
criticism the Board has raised sufficient
cash from the sale of reserve shares to see
the co. “through to the producing stage.
* * * *
Some call-paying Mararoa shareholders
are wondering when some of the reported
wealth in the co.’s Emu mines (W.A.) is
going to be extracted. It is now some
time since the purchase of these properties
was completed, yet the only information
broadcasted about them has been about,
water supply and an odd reference to values
being apparently as good as ever. Assum-
ing that sufficient water for treatment pur-
poses has been obtained, the cost ot a suit-
able plant to extract the gold will, as The
Bulletin previously pointed out, me.au
calls and perhaps disappointment in the end.
The latest about the co.'s blocks at Wiluna,
which were officially reported us fttvorobly
situated,” is that they are under exemption
pending the “completion of petrological
examination of the drill core and the deter-
mination of the future policy of explora-
tion.” „ »

The plan of calling for State aid is being
tried by the Freney-KimberleyrOkes Duraclc
oil combination. Dr. Wade’s assertion that
some of the country held gives better chance
of success than anything he had yet seen in
Australia may be the lever used. Surely such
ambitious floats shouldn’t already lack foi.
funds. Of course Dr. Clapp’s condemnation
was a nasty hit, the effect of which lias
not yet passed from the public mind, despite
the directors avowal that as far as they know
the Yank expert didn’t got within 101 ► miles
of their bores. At the Fitzroy the drill is
down 1640 ft.. and traces of oil are said to
have increased. Boring at Mt. Wynne is to
be resumed with the plant able to roach
4000 ft. if funds for drilling to that depth
are forthcoming.

After paying £1520.000 in divs. out of the
Edna May, M. ’l’. Williams chucked gold
for oil. Acting for the Borneo Oil Option
syndicate, he lias picked up an over
28,000 acres of concessions in the Koetei
Dutch territory of the island. Of the block
785 acres is favored by a Hollander geolo-
gist. Most people would ask why lie has
not passed on the area to the Shell or its
pups, which are keen at grabbing anything
worth a bean, either within Dutch territory
or anywhere else. Williams s area lies north
of their producing Sanga Sanga concessions,
which makes the puzzle the more bewilder-
ing. Probably the fact that £400.000 has
to change hands if the syndicate comes to
grips with the holders of the solves
the mystery. Williams’s co. consists of
£25.000 in 10,000 shares of 50s. each, of
which 5000 have been issued. A deposit of
£2OOO lias to be lodged by March, and an-
other £2O-.000 is wanted for boring. Before
the money goes out of this country contribu-
tors should know whether the Hague is likely
to consent to a British-owned concern secur-
ing an adeauate title, and wliat royalty will
be asked. Bux has been on the same quest,
and tlie Yank was about earlier. But the
Dutch have been too slim for Brother Jona-
than to penetrate a foot into the East Indies
oil areas, despite the strongest diplomatic
pressure and a threat of reprisals regarding
Shell interests in the U.S.

Little more than gouging has been done
at Lawn Hill (Q.) silver-lead field, and
things will be pretty dull there until the end
of the wet season. Up to December about
50 tons of galena ore was being got monthly,
and from returns to hand this has proved
very disappointing in silver. One lot of 47
tons assayed 74.5 p.c. lead, but only 6oz.
7dwt. silver. It is too low in silver for a
gouger’s ideal. But probably it will never
be much more than it is, for the indications
don’t point to big tonnages but suggest
small, compact lodes of galena that can be
easily worked. And the place is more iso-
lated than even Mt. Isa was before the latter
got motor transport.
Clark, of Cairns, is launching the Palmer
River Gold Co.; he wants to place a modest
20,000 contribs. at 6d. application and (id.
allotment to do preliminaries. The wet
season should soon be over, and then the
boring plant can get to work and tell whether
the venture is worth while. The co. now
holds about 10 miles of the river.
Concurrently with the diamond-drill bor-
ing of Mt. Isa Prop.’s leases, sinking will be
resumed in the deep Black Star shaft of Mt.
Isa Mines. The steam winding plant is in
course of erection, and March reports from
this shaft should throw light on the assay
values likely to be met in the sulphides. The
co.’s Rio Grande shaft is down 150 ft., but
the water is becoming such a nuisance that
work may stop there at any moment.

If anyone has reasonable grounds for a
grouch against Labor Governments it is the
miners and shareholders of the Blair Athol
coal cos. The biggest seam of black coal
in the world produced the paltry total of
2690 tons during January. The State col-
liery at Baralaba is increasing its output, but
unfortunately there is not a market in Cen-
tral Queensland for the two groans. The
concession the Government has offered- —to
convey Blair Athol export coal for }d. a
ton-mile to a port—is valueless in the absence
of orders.

Poor old Carlyle, after propping the Ben-
digo Amalgamated for so Jong, has had to go
back to calls. Work is being done on the
Unity back at 1264 ft. The spurs are poor
and the extent of undeveloped ground nothing
much to speak of. Prospecting south at
1327 ft. is a bit. more encouraging. The pre-
sent plan is to test a run of stone making
into the claim from the Garden Gully. The
contraction of operations illustrates how
gutted of good stone are the old massive for-
mations.
* * # *
Bendigo describes work at the Hercules as
“satisfactory.” Yet only 7600 tons came out
of the mine during a six months’ campaign,
or about a fortnight’s treatment at a medium-
sized Kalgoorlie battery. Yield works out
at 39150 z., with scrapings from the plates,
or, roughly, lOdwt. a ton ; and out of the
proceeds profits of £3OOO were disbursed.
What makes the output so insignificant is
the official yarn that a reef of “big dimen-
sions” at 1380 ft. was available to furnish
ore. Truth is the reef is patchy, and it is
only the skill of the manager in selecting
that keeps the grade right. Great things
are to come from 1520 ft.: north, beyond
800 ft., richer stone shows there. The hope
is that this shoot of gold will be picked up
at 1440 ft., too, thereby providing fair-sized
reserves. Hercules is only down to a mod-
erate depth, and the line which has fur-
nished a lot of divs. may have another
advent.

As the Wild Cat said weeks ago, in spite
of all the talk there is not going to be any
industrial trouble at Broken Hill. The offi-

to risk losing what the cos. offer them,

The value of the output of minerals in
N.S.W. last year was £18623.088, which
exceeds the 1923 record by £2,331.672. The
increase was almost general. Silver, lead
and zinc were notable contributors of
£5,606.931 (£1238,417 increase) ; but the
greatest was c0a1—11.618,216 tons, valued
(pit-mouth) at £9,589.547. So far as silver-
lead is concerned, ores and concentrates are
treated at Port Pirie (S.A.), which adds
a further two millions to their value to the
Commonwealth. Tin to the value of
£259,485 was won, and gold about held its
own at £79.390. Total production figures:
Silver, lead and zinc (to Dec.. 1924),
£116.767.433; coal, £142.000.000; t*i,
£13.000.000: copper, £15.000,000; gold,
£63,000.000.

Santa Catarina Oil Wells, floated last
year in Sydney to bore in Mexican Cali-
fornia, anpears to be near the end of its
tether. The co. is in 200.000 2s. shares, all
called up; and the latest cable from attorney
McUvoy nuietly shifts the oil sands 500 ft.
lower. Six weeks ago the bore was down
2000 ft. It has gained a whole 20ft. in the
six weeks, and as usual “evidences of oil
are most encouraging.” The prospectus
stated that Professor Skeats anticipated oil
at 1250 ft.: whereas McEvoy now concludes
that “production is anticipated within the
next 500 ft.” Independent opinion from
Rosario might be enlightening.
Christmas Gift, near Cootnmundra

Lampeh, a Siamese tin-dredging co., with
Melbourne headquarters, suffered from the
usual over-estimate of yardage capacity dur-
ing its first run from March to September.-
Some valuable time was lost in alterations
to plant, and at the end of September 49
tons had been won from 223,532 yards, an
average of under Soz. Only 40 p.c. of pros-
pectus figures were realised in the earlier
stages; but the end of the run reached as
high as 95 p.c. Loss on working account
was £923 : development accounted for £3578.
Creditors, mostly for machinery, are waiting
for £14,098. The eo. has an area of 428
acres in leases, and a prospecting area of
4374 acres besides.

William McMillan (Ma State) and S. Aus.
ex-Agent-Gcneral Dr. J. A. Cockburn, each
in his 75th year, are the only survivors of
the 18 delegates to the Australian Federation
Conference convened by Henry Parltes, and
held in Melbourne 35 years ago this month.
M.L. Premier Massey has only to hang on
until the end of August to smash Dick Sed-
don’s record. Seddon reigned for 18 years
and a little over one month, and Massey got
the job in July, 1912. lOU Ward, who
kept going ftp- more than 54 years, takes
third place. Since the appointment of its
first under responsible government, on
May 7, 1856, M.L. has had 31 Ministries
and 19 Premiers. Atkinson was in charge
five times, but they were soon in and out
in his, day. In 1876 he reigned for 12 days,
then resigned, reconstructed his Cabinet and
hung out for 18 months. Henry Sewell, the
first Premier, had only a week of glory.
Ned Hogan, who has been chosen by Vic.
Parliamentary Labor party as first lieuten-
ant to Prendergast, in place of the late J. W.
Billson, won the job by shaping well when
Minister for Railways and Agriculture in
the Labor Government (July-November,
1924). Before get-
ting office he was
merely a destruc-
tive critic witli
strong party lean-
ings and fondness
for exaggerated
statement. Look-
ing as if he had
stepped out of a
f r a m e labelled
“Irish' pathriot,”
he is the tallest
man in the State
Parliament, and his
long head and crest
of coal-black hair
make him look even
taller. He was
born in his con-
stituency (Warren-
heip), but has a

The promotion of O. T. ,7. Alpers, of
Christchurch, to the M.L. Supreme Court
Bench was thought to create a precedent.
Born at Copenhagen, of Danish parents, he
was believed in M.L. to be the first Judge
in the Empire not born a British subject.
But Homburg, a S. Australian Judge of
a former generation, was born in Brunswick.
A sound scholar of prehensile mind and wide
range, particularly in English literature, in
which he has held a University chair, Alpers
has been professor and busy journalist, as
well as eminent barrister. While not claim-
ing quite the technical equipment of Sal-
mond, he has all of his literary gift. In a sur-
prising list of side accomplishments he in-
cludes a devastating wit which as occasion
requires may draw on Horace, Shakspeare
or W. S. Gilbert to light up dark places. At
Christchurch they think Chesterton is a
pale imitation of Alpers.
Died suddenly last week, at 50, J. J.
Dobbyn—"Barcoo,” of The Bulletin, and
owner of limes Vale station, Mitchell (Q.).
A tall, soldierly-looking man, he lost an arm
in early manhood, the result of a horse acci-
dent. He travelled over 130 miles to the
nearest doctor, who had to be sobered up
before he could carry out the operation. With
his one arm “Barcoo” was still a first-rate
billiard-player and rifle-shot, and as handy
a man about his property as the best. Ha
remained a bachelor until three years back,
when he resumed an interrupted romance
staged on the- banks of the Murray in the
long ago by marrying the widow of Dr.
O’Shaughnessy, of Albury (N.S.W.). The
Bulletin’s “Aboriginalities” Pages will miss
his occasional but always well-informed bush

Frank Clarke, President of Vic. Uppah
Chambah, has decided to desert the northern
province, which lie now represents, and to
stand in May for Melbourne South province,
which Arthur Robinson doesn’t want any
more. Before resolving on the change Clarke
took soundings, and came to the conclusion
that the risk was worth while. The A.W.N.L.
adopted him as its candidate with a blare
ot trumpets. It was the least it could do,
ir felt, for the pet son of its former chief
and torch-bearer, Janet Lady Clarke. Mel
bourne South is a mere label for the con-
stituency, which takes in such semi-conser-
vative nests as St. Ivilda, South Yarra,
Middle Park and Balaclava.

of the Bondi A.L.P., has been duly endorsed

With solid A.W.U. support, and a good
vote from the general body of Laborites,
R. S. Ross has a substantial chance of being

Ross is a man to whom nothing in life is

constructive thinkers the Labor party pos-
sesses. lie has got well into the forties,
after some hard battling on the Inky Way.
His first editorial experience was on a
Queensland sporting paper: then lie edited
Barrier Truth and the M.L. Worker. He

ment, but has never before sought political
honors for himself.

Howse who, after convincing Birdwood, Fetherston
and Babtie [the senior medical officer in the Medi-
terranean] , induced the British authorities to recog-

Council, a member of the Working Men’s
College Inquiry Board, and had charge ot
arrangements for Victoria during the big
’fin epidemic. If ever a man possessed the
ability to get things done he did : the story is
still told of how he once electrified the elderly,
slow-moving councillors at a certain Board
meeting by moving with great formality
“that the next meeting of the Board be held
on a merry-go-round,” adding plaintively,
“because we never get anywhere.”

Brisbane, an ex-M.L.A. for Charters Towers.
From whip-boy on the Towers goldfields he
worked on to the Inky Way, and conducted the
Labor Eagle with varying success. After
being member for Charters Towers from 1901
to 1907, he drifted from one job to another
( lie was editor of Trinity Times at Cairns
for a while), and was finally dropped in the
cosy chair of the City Coroner.
Adelaide gets (at £lOOO a year) and Hobart
loses 11. E. Bellamy, the water and sewers
expert. He learnt his business in England,
Australia first seeing him about 1900, when
he gave five years to making Rockhampton
sweeter and wetter. After a similar job at
Colombo, and further experience in the
U.S.A. he came to Sydney in 1912, and put
in some years on the Vaucluse and Long
Bay schemes. He has been tidying up Hobart
as City Engineer for the last seven years.
Now he goes to S.A. as Hydraulic Engineer,
which post has been held by only three men
since Oswald Brown was brought from Eng-
land close on half a century ago to arrange
deep drainage for the City of Churches.
Matthew Henry Legae, just dead at Haw-

Elizabeth Morris Young, just dead at
Brighton (Vic.), made her first appearance
in Collins-strcet, Melbourne, in 1841; and
not many of the native-born who saw 1925

daughter of John Clarke, a ("well-known

Gale Barnard, musician and old-time mate

The Last Post has just sounded over
B<q-geant Bartlett Provo, of Dunedin
(M.L.). The sarge was a spectacular figure

was a member of the first volunteer corps
formed in Victoria in the ’fifties, sailed in
1863 from Australia with Colonel Pitt’s
volunteers to deal with the Maori braves
who were on the warpath, and was the
oldest volunteer in M.L. He had notched 86
when the call came.
Rupert Millane, who knocked the new

a former officer of the Forestry Department.
The Millane family has been thinking out
things for 40 years, and is generally a gen-
eration or two ahead of public opinion. As
lar back as 1800 Rupert’s father gave a
vivid picture of coming traffic congestion,
and advocated a railway at the northern
end of inner Melbourne, but neither the
Raihvay Committee nor the public heark-

Mr. Wilshire, Mayor in 1844. The pit of
the old Victoria Theatre was boarded over
for the occasion.

out of a quarry at the rear of Govern-
ment House. The first preacher was
the Rev. T. Quinton Stow, whose son was
to become a Supreme Court Judge. The old
building had two Kingston memories; not
only was Charles Cameron’s father the archi-

TIME.
[FOR THE BULLEIN.]
The years go slowly up the hill,
And pause to glance and stay to talk,
Like an old man on a morning walk,
Until they reach the crown;
Then with the speed of a boy’s will
They run on and down.
O years, if you were young as fair,
ltunning on and up the hill,
With swift feet that were never still,
You might pause a while on the crown
And let the old man breathe the air
As he walked slowly down.
But you are old and life is young,
Ariel time and joy go ill together;
You speed a man like a wind-tossed feather,
And draw a boy like a weight of lead.
And ever and ever the song sung
Is a mourping for days dead.
The velvet wind, the silken day
And all the little laughing grasses
Cry shame on Time because he passes
With a jest on his foolish tongue;
But he has come so far, they say,
And he has so far to go, they say,
He is old before he is young.

THE LONG-LIFE
BATTERY.
For starting and lighting motor cars, for Wireless and foi
every similar purpose, Exide Batteries have for many years
been famous for long life and dependable service.
There is a suitable type for every car, and for every Radio
requirement.
Exide Batteries are backed by a world-wide service.
Chloride.
Chloride Batteries are used all over the world for central
power stations, for house lighting, and for every purpose
where a “Stationary” battery is required. Unfailing relia-
bility, freedom from buckling of the plates, and long life are
the leading features.
I
The Electrical Engineer who has studied batteries invariably
specifies “Chloride.”
Exide - Ironclad.
The inception and growth of Electric Traction calls for a
battery that can withstand rough usage and heavy charge and
discharge rates.
Exide-Ironclad batteries are specially designed for this work.
The special construction of the positive plate renders the
battery capable of being “boosted” at high rates without
disintegration of the plates—a feature no other battery
possesses.
Lux.
Railway lighting in all countries throughout the world depends
on Lux batteries. These batteries have been developed,
through many years of close association with the leading
Railway Companies, to give trouble-free service with
maximum efficiency.
“A TYPE FOR EVERY REQUIREMENT.”

"Nor’-West”: I agree with “Simon II.”
(B. 29/l/’25) that “Moe’s” theory that the
tiliovt cod inhabits swift waters and the
elongated one has its habitat in deep reaches
is not satisfying. I have caught both the
long and the short cod in the swift waters of
the Severn, Gwydir, Nainoi and Condainine, and in
the deep sluggish pools as well. Some old-timers
win tell you that the short cod is the “rock
tod,” but I regard that as another myth. In my
opinion, the short fish is ma and the long one dad.
If “Simon II.” and “Moe” take notice, they will
find the roes always in the shorter and thicker lish.
It is certain that there is but one speices of
Murray cod. The cod has nothing to do with the
absence of jew- or cat-fish, bream or yellow belly in
the Severn River, at all events. There were no
fish in the Severn above the falls until cod were
Put in at Ranger’s Valley station many years ago.
Catfish were put into a dam at Strathbogie station',
near Emmaville, and have got into the Severn River
there and made their way up to a sound full three
miles above Emmaville, which plainly proves that cod
cannot keep them out of a stream to which thev
gain access. It is probable that the tod were put
into the Gwydir above the falls in the old days also,
ninth would explain the absence of the other fish
mentioned.

Gouger cannot possibly state authoritatively what
a dingo will invariably do when
filing an emu, for the reason
that the spectacle is not likely to
be witnessed by one man more
than once or twice during a life-
time. I have spent half a life-
time in dingo country and have
seen it only once. On topping a
sandhill one evening I pulled up
my horse at the sight of an emu
helming in a peculiar manner on
the fiat, below. He was running in
irregular circles of about 200
>aids, and was evidently dis-
tressed. Presently I was able to
pick out two dingoes relaying
him from one to the other. One
would leave the spinifex and run
the bird for about 200 yards;
then the mate would take up the
job. 'When an emu is close
pressed, but fresh, lie runs very
erect, the neck and body almost
perpendicular; this chap was slow-
ing up, with head anl neck
sti etched out. 1 was about to
prevent the murder by cracking-
my whip, when the larger dog-
flashed out of the spinifex and
went clean over the emu. I was
sufficiently close to see the peculiar
sidelong jerk of his head as he
struck the bird. Examination
showed the victim’s neck broken
and almost severed. The clean-
bred warrigal does not grip or
worry like a dog, but strikes, in
passing, like the Canadian wolf.
1 have seen a sheep cut clean,
two inches deep, from shoulder
to elbow, b v v one blow of a dingo. 1 once made a
crust, (and something to put on it) trapping these
gentlemen, so I know a little about them—no one
knows much.

ez „ • doesn't know ns much as
uouger about cmu-catching. I had a black
kangaroo-dog—Jack Johnson—that always caught the
big birds by the neck, and, moreover, he was never
kicked by one. He raced up alongside, jumped for
the neck and then sat back. The result was a
complete somersault for Mr. Emu and a broken neck.
Johnson never used to stop to see the results of his
work as long as other emus were in sight. I have
seen him kill four out of one flock in the above
manner. His grip for a ’roo was the butt of the
tail, changing to the back of the neck as opportunity
offered.
W .3.C. : “ll.lk’s” N.S.W. North Coast
abo., -with his supreme being Mirrooral, is a much
more advanced type than the N.Q. inland nigger.
• K.B. s” nigger’s hell savors slightly of Dante’s
limbo, and his heaven is almost theosophical with its
planes of varying merit. This all points to a more
highly imaginative and more philosophical turn of
mind than is found among my particular black
acquaintances. These have not risen to the heights
of conceiving of a supreme being, protective and all-
good. The reason is obvious. Australia, especially
A.Q. with its rich natural endowment of birds, uni-
mals and tropical fruits, presented a happy hunting-
ground for the native—warm sun and abundance of
food. All he needed was at hand, and he had no
enemies to fear. Nature and his environment de-
manded of him only the ingenuity to produce a sharp
killing instrument and a rough shelter from the
elements. For these reasons we find him among
SAFETY FIRST.
LADY OF CAR (to friend): "You know, dear, our chuff is such a careful driver. We
hare run down hundreds, and not a fatality amongst them.”
Uie lowest of human types; for conflict and a strong
urge towards self-protecticn are the first essentials
of evolution and progress. But in India, with
fierce carnivorous animals stalking the land, the
natives in terror looked beyond themselves for help;
and on the fertile brain of one reacted to produce a
god. lie shouted his inspiration, and, lo! a religion
was born. Even if this life was uncertain, the
next would make up for it. Thus was spiritual
comfort ensured. The Australian abo. needed no
such spiritual support, for he had no fear and hunger
troubled him not, so long as he had energy to seek
his food. Practically in all things his existence
on this earth was secure, and the advantages of
provision for a comfortable life hereafter did not
occur to him. He could not even rise to the
level of sun worship. True, h<f had to face illness
and ultimately death. These ho attributed to “evil
night-walkers”—in Eacham dialect “bainegurrumba
junjabunni douragee”—who originated from dead
bodies which had not been mummified by binding in
palm leaves and lawyer-cane, a process which pre-
vented the “evil-walker” escaping from the body. These
evil bodies were not spirits, but earthly, and
assumed any fantastic shape, depending on the shade
of blue of the funk of the observer. Thus, my abo.
believed in a type of metempsychosis; but not the
mild transmutation of Pythagoras, who declined to
cat beans for fear he should eat his departed grand-
mother. All Binghi’s “evil-walkers” were intensely
evil and decidedly unvegetable. And in connection
with them his highest mental effort was the belief
that they fear fire and appear only at night. Con-
sequently he travels at night seldom and then only
when armed with firesticks, which he swings vigor-
ously as lie marches. When any in the tribe became
ill, which was due to the laying-on of hands of an
evil one, treatment consisted of poultices of-hot
coals. I his invariably worked, for as courage is
foreign to Binghi—due to ages of immunity from
serious enemies—and as the cure was much worse
than the disease, it was profitable to feel well. Anl
after one treatment the general attitude became that
of the scalded cat.
* * * *
. “T* U P" : “Longo’s” goanna that swal-
lowed its opponent (B. 15/l/’25) reminds me of one
I post-mortemed in the Gulf Country. Lying out
on a sandy plain, it seemed very sluggish, and
after shooting it an investigation revealed among
its cargo two black snakes, each as long as the
go. himself—23in. One was partly digested, the
skin coining off in patches; the other had only
lately been taken on board.
“FY7”: “Simon II.” asks (B. 2!)/l/’25)
how the Murray cod gets the mussels out of their
shells when it swallows them whole, later ejecting
the apparently closed shells without the mussels.
Once among the digestive juices the mussel soon
sickens, like an oyster in fresh water, and his
shell opens slightly. The juices quickly make an end
of the mussel, and the empty case is “returned to
grower.” Many other fish that swallow mussels
and oysters whole—the rays and some others —have
their throats fitted with a powerful crushing appara-
tus, exactly like a rockbreaker, which deals with
the shells.
“Colub’- : Most snake-experts who let their
pets bite them assert that they are able to do so
because of their knowledge of a general antidote to
snake-poison, a claim they have never been able to
sustain by production of the antidote. What is
more likely is that amongst them are some who
possess a genuine immunity to the" venom of the
species they handle, although with a large number
the feat of letting the shakes bite them is nothing
but trickery, the reptiles being previously induced
to discharge the contents of their poison-glands. In
the cases of a few it is possible that immunity has
been acquired by permitting themselves to be so
bitten that only minute quantities of venom have
been injected. After a few times they would be
able to stand a much larger quantity of venom,
against which they would be partially protected and
which, in its turn, would add to the immunity. The
human system quickly becomes immune to venom
of even the greatest toxicity, and in the laboratory
individuals have been protected in this manner
against such highly poisonous reptiles as the rattle-
snake. Such protection, however, docs not take

long to wear off; but in the case of those daily hand-
ling snakes and frequently being bitten, it would
be not only renewed but probably increased by each
injection.

a deep shade. And next to bandicoot is nicelv toasted

THE ROARING DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oli our days were tilled with labor and our thoughts
were filled with beer,
And we used to greet the buyers with a deep thirst-
laden (heer;
So we hit the townships singing and we drank the
clock around,
\\ hen the price of rabbit-skins went up to ten-and-
six a pound.
A\ ell we knew the joys of battle, and the air was
charged with bricks
'\ hen we stoushcd a cop at Bredbo wlio'd surprised
us after six ;
Oh, they searched the town at daybreak, but I’m
blest if we were found—
" ell, it wasn’t strange when rabbit-skins were ten-
and-six a pound.
1 here was Wild O’Toole from Cooma, who got shot
at Berridale,
Singing “Glory be to Ireland” as they yanked him
oil' to gaol;
But the magistrate was English, so in honor he was
bound
To increase the fine when rabbit-skins were ten-and-
six a pound.
Iheie were nights on A unuTalla when we went upon
the spree,
hen we danced and drank till morning while our
cash went fast and free;
And the number who saw rabbits bunnv-hugging on
the ground
Was surprising when the skins were fetching ten-and-
six a pound.
PROFESSIONAL PRIDE.
"Wot, are yer (join' to take ’er insults lyin’ down?”
"I can afford to. dearie — l’ve bin insulted by experts in
my time.”
Ah, those roaring days are over and the skins are
two-and-nine,
And the nights are mostly peaceful in the pub at
Jindabvne;
Yet it’s often that I’m thinking of the rough, tough
boys I found,
V hen the price of rabbit-skins went up to ten-and-

Rabbits exterminated with
CALCIUM CYANIDE
This excellent preparation is not “hit or miss” in its
results. It hits every time. Blown like rlust into the burrow,
hollow log or among rocks, it gives off deadly fumes over 24
hours, makes every opening visible, and kills every rabbit.
The New Fumo Dust Blower is the
result of experience in the application
of CALCIUM CYANIDE in the past 12
months.
It is strong, simple and convenient. The supply of dust is
under direct control and can be completely shut off if desired.

“Dawapia”: I never saw a man more fed
up with mutton-birds than a certain reverend gentle-
man who was shipwrecked on Badger Bland (Bass
Strait). When the Linda picked him up he made
for the galley and demanded beef. He told us
that for the months he was marooned he had
had mutton-birds’ eggs for every breakfast, boiled
mutton-birds for every lunch, and baked or stewed
mutton-birds for every dinner. Ho slept on a mutton-
bird feather bed and pillow ; had scones made with
mutton-bird fat; caught cold and was doctored with
mutton-bird oil (inside and out) ; and the last straw
was piled on him when the sole inhabitant of Badger
Island presented him with a small keg of salted
mutton-birds to take home.
“Sucre”: “Imbaga’s” spider (B. 29/l/’25)
is a sick spinner compared with one big fellow
in the Ravenshoe Scrub (N.Q.). There the cocky,
after clearing his land, plants posts six feet apart
around the clearing. In less than a week there is
a cobw'eb netting right round strong enough to
keep out everything but droughts and mortgages.
“8.8. C.”: Is this a record? A 15-foot
female tiger-shark, fitted with an 18-inch mouth and
five rows of teeth, had been caught on a line near
Gladstone (Q.). While struggling it gave birth to
two youngsters each 2ft. long, and after being
despatched by bullets and knife, was opened to reveal
49 similar youngsters. The grand total of 51 was

far in excess of anything seen in the vicinity before.
The stomach, by the way, contained the business-end
of a hammerhead shark. In the same locality the
head of a big bluenose man-eater was lately hooked
without the body, which had just been snapped off
from behind. Life seems to be fairly exciting for
sharks in that neighborhood.
“Old Blue”: Touching “1.L.1.’5” remarks
ibout the white man’s vision compared with the
native’s (B. 22/l/’25). On the Sinai desert it was
sometimes possible, on a clear day and without
glasses, for the ordinary-sighted Lighthorseman to
pick up a horse-track five or six miles away. The
phenomenon was caused by the sun, before and after

crossing the meridian, casting a shadow on one side
of the deep imprint in the loose sand, so that at a
distance there seemed to be a dark line against the
surrounding sandhills.

“The Rumpus”: A little thing you can
notice in Westralia would have told “iiudge” how
to dislodge a swarm of bees from his house (B.
15/l/’25). The rank smell of green jarrah is the
one reason why a respectable colony of bees won’t use
the tree-trunks as honey-factories, no matter how
good the accommodation or how sweet the syrup of
their flowers. For the same reason I suppose a hive
of bees could not iive within 200 yards of the Syd-
ney Town Hall.
* * # *
“Troophorse”: “T.lv.T.’s” par. on fancy
barbering (B. 22/l/’25) reminds me of the methods
employed by the natives around Blue Mud Bay and
Groote Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria (N.T.).
When they think they need a shave (which happens
only when they strike some flash beche-de-mer lugger
skipper clean-shaven), the bearded one will take a
handful of ash and rub the stuff dry over his face.
After some hard rubbing a friend is called over to
pluck him like a goose. The niggers report that
after this preparation the hair comes away without
an}' feeling at all. Perhaps the ashes, made mostly
from the burning of mangrove and paper-bark fire-
wood, have the same depilatory effect as lime on a
hide. It does not appear to have any deleterious
effect upon their skins. Around the Alligator River
(N.T.) the barber coats the ends of his fingers and
thumb with bloodwood gum, and then plucks his
victim without any anaesthetic whatever.
“MunjongT: The color of crows’ eyes
varies from dark-brown to white, and “Wart” is right
in saying that the difference is a matter of age. I
have seen birds in captivity wjiose eyes became
lighter as they aged, and have shot both white- and
dark-eyed fiends at the same job of frightfulness.
Will “E.S.S.” say how he knew the eye-color of birds
he saw working on live sheep? If there is a differ-
ence in size it is not sufficiently marked to be notice-
able at, say, 300 yards.

“L.J.”: A Lake Tyers (Vic.) legend of
fire doesn’t leave any necessity for a prodigal's
explanation to his spouse as to how he came into
possession of the secret of fire-making. The goddess (B.
22/l/’25) figures in the story, only here it was yams,
not fish, Binghi was dissecting. On her arrival, the
heavenly visitor joined him in his meal, against his
vociferously expressed wish. His protestations reached
the ears of his Mary, who proceeded to investigate
the cause. Jealousy inflamed the goddess, so with
a glance she literally burned her opponent, leaving
only a heap of smouldering ashes. In this fire she
roasted her yams and gave Binghi his first cooked
feed. As evening drew near, however, retribution
overtook the goddess. The “great spirit,” doing his
rounds, saw and disapproved of what his wanton
daughter had done, so he ordered her return to her
home. The sorrowing widower was rewarded by a
present from the “great spirit” of “the ashes that
would never go out.” (Blacks carried their fire 3
from camp to camp.) When this bereaved Binghi
died, he became the north wind —hot with desire and
causing the fire-god to awake.
“Daru”: “Parama” is correct in his de-
scription of Darnley Island as the last resting-place
of scores of Japanese
divers. White ones,
too. In the ’nineties
the Calico Reef was a
veritable death-trap.
The specific gravity of
saltwater, it is well
known, varies in differ-
ent parts of the ocean.
Around Darnley it is
considered particularly
“heavy” ; the same con-
dition is ascribed to
the deeps of China
Strait, near Samarai
(Papua), where good
shell was raised daily
from depths ranging
from 22 to 29 fathoms.
The Japanese took risks
on Calico for the ex-
tremely good shell that
could be found there,
but they paid a big
price for it. Conse-
quently Darnley got its
graveyard well tenanted
with dead Japanese,
and most of their last
homes were marked
with a post as “Par-
ama” states. Possibly
most of these wooden
“stones” have rotted
away by now or been
digested by the white
ants. One tale of Calico
is of two Japanese
fatalists. No 1 was
hauled up a corpse
from a 30-fathom
patch. Number 2
helped to undress the
dead man, donned the
dress himself to make
the most of the
“slack water” (the
period between tides)
—and was drawn up
dead. The red irag
was fastened at half-mast in the mizzen
backstays, and the lugger went to Darnley to add
two more to the graveyard.

“Linklater”: Have never heard of mango
trees bringing fleas, but last mango season North
Queensland people with a tree in close proximity to
the house complained that during the ripening of the
fruit fleas became a pest. The invasion was reckoned
to be due to flying-foxes, which during the season
visit the mango-trees in swarms. AVith the finishing
of the fruit the foxes discontinued their visits, and
the fleas disappeared.

“F.D.D.”: One of the measures adopted
by wild cattle of earlier ages to avoid attracting the
attention of flesh-eating beasts has survived many
hundred generations of domestication, and upon occa-
sion arouses the pri-
mitive in placid old
Buttercup of to-day.
This is the impulse to
kill or drive away any
member of the herd
which has suffered a
hurt resulting in a
flow of blood. Our
milkers ran in a scrub
paddock where they
were liable to injury
through staking; ot, as
happened once, through
the loss of the tail tuft,
due to the beast strug-
gling after the switch
had become entangled
in the jagged end of a
log. On each occasion
I found the hurt ani-
mal in hiding, evi-
dently aware that its
blood-smeared skin
made its presence un-
welcome to the others.
The disturbing effect of
the blood smell was
apparent when I col-
lected the cattle and
started them home. Un-
easy until the odor was
traced to the wounded
animal, two or three
of them then set upon
her. Unresisting, she
was horned and buff-
eted considerably be-
fore I could interfere. Whether she would
have been killed is an open question, but plainly the
impulse to do so was strong.
* * * *
“Morob”: Although, as a rule, the New
Guinea and Northern Australian croc, will attack
man only when he is by himself, there have been
occasions when a reptile has made an onslaught on a
whole party, and has succeeded in doing a good deal
of damage. In the Morobe district of New Guinea
in 1917 five white men, all armed, and four natives
were going up a creek in a whaleboat. Turning a
bend in the creek they ran on a mudbank. All
hands were getting the boat off again when a big
croc, suddenly appeared amongst the grass and reeds
that lined the water’s edge, and without a second’s
hesitation charged boat and party. The reptile
struck the side of the boat, canting it over and spill-
ing its occupants out on to the mudbank. Placing
its forefeet on the timber, it snapped its great jaws
and emitted a kind of snarl. Then it crushed part
of the gunwale between its teeth. At this stage one
of the party fired a bullet from a .45-calibre revolver
into the soft flesh beneath its fore-feet, mortally
wounding it, and another missile from the same
weapon settled it altogether. The natives in those
parts say that the old-man croc, is always dangerous
during the breeding season, when he will go out of
his way to attack anybody.
* * * #
“Bouragi”: The carved posts put up in
their burying-grounds by the aboriginals of Bathurst
and Melville islands (B. i/l/’25) are totem poles,
and are to be found, not only in Madagascar and
Patagonia, as “Wessel” remarks, but wherever else
totemism is practised, from China to Peru. Since,
naturally, live totems are no use to the spirits of
the dead, artificial representations take their place,
just as toy weapons and other representations of the
living man’s possessions are placed in the grave
with the corpse.
* * * *
“May Flower”: “Tally Banyan’s” white
snake reminds me of a white swallow that built in
our house for several years, but has disappeared of
late. I suppose it was just a freak, like a white
kangaroo that used to inhabit this district until he
was shot for his skin by a kangaroo hunter—may
Barcoo-rot get him!
* * # #
“T.C.W.”: This tip may come in handy
some time. After suffering considerable discomfort
through a swarm of bees settling between the roof
and the ceiling, so that the honey dripped through,
I got the carpenter to take off a sheet of iron and
several weatherboards, and thus dislodged them. But
they came back, and, when nearly driven silly, I
thought of the dislike bees have for kerosene. I tried
the liquid on the bees, and the effect was startling.
Now, whenever a swarm appears likely to settle, 1
just throw some kerosene about and they soon dis-
appear.
* * * *
“Jarrah”: I can corroborate wdiat “Up
Top” says (B. 8/l/’25) about a person suffering from
sunstroke walking backwards when the intention is
to go forward. My wife went across to see a neigh-
bor one hot morning. When she returned she com-
plained of headache. In the afternoon she had a
severe attack of vomiting. I saw her walking towards
the steps leading on to the back verandah; but
suddenly she began to step backwards. She did this
four times before she could w'alk up the steps. I
asked casually if it was a new dance she was practis-
ing, but the fire that flashed from her eyes withered
my jocularity. For three days she had the same
peculiar experience and it took a week to get rid
of the headache.
SOCIAL ITEM.
PARSON'A LADY : “I called to see Janey, Billy.”
BILLY : “Janey not at ’om,e to-day, missus. Him dress bin dryin’.”
“Munjong”: Neither “Moe” nor “Simon
II.” mentioned the difference of color between the
two varieties of Murray cod. The thicker fish is a
muddy grey, with darker mottled markings; in the
color scheme of the other green predominates, and the
belly is almost silver. Again, the head of the latter
fish is longer and inclined to be slightly concave from
the eyes to the point of the snout. I have repeatedly
caught both kinds from the same holes in the Murrum-
bidgee, so environment is not an explanation.
LOWING CATTLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When the day’s last light is going
And the distant trees are greying,
Sweet it is to hear the lowing
Of far cattle on the hillsides,
Through the grass and bracken straying.
Softly when no breeze is stirring
Comes that far sound, rising, falling,
When no startled quail goes whirring
Through brown grasses, and the plovers
On the creek flats cease their calling.
Then, when winds no longer riot
In the tree-tops, holding revel,
Tuned it seems to Nature’s quiet,
To her mood that soothes with slumber
Hill and hollow, slope and level;
Heard by herdsmen, watchful, lcnely,
Ages since, ’mid falling shadows,
Swayed by fancy, fancy only.
He that hears it now re-visions
Twilights old on English meadows.
When in distance she-oaks darken
And the day’s last light is failing,
Sweet it is to sit and heaVken
To the lowing of far cattle,
Through the grass and bracken trailing.
For who hears them falls a-dreaming.
Knows sure rest, sure rest and thorough,
Thinks not of his axe-blade gleaming
In the timber, or his ploughshare
Driving through the stubborn furrow.
Yea, who hears far cattle lowing
When dim lit the fading west is,
And the pulse of life is slowing.
As dusk gathers o’er the landscape,
Knows, in truth, what kindly rest is.

The Peacock-S.vme wedding made a splash
in the summer-calm water of the social pool.
Four hundred invitations had been broad-
casted, and, thanks to press publicity, the
bridal party found itself moving up the path-
way of Holy Trinity (Ivcw) between a
double line of massed humans, who overflowed
the pavements for several furlongs. Bride
Hilaria dimpled on her father’s arm, her
maternal grandmother’s old Brussels veiling
her youthful silhouette. Small sister Felicity
trotted behind the train, beaming ecstatically
above a gold-brocaded frock. Ivah Perry and
Ainslie Williams, with sister Joan and cousin
Nancy Syme, ’maided prettily in white and
gold with golden head swathes; Charles
Campbell sustained the nice-looking young
’groom. The old Syme home, Blytheswood,
where the dining-room tables complained
under the weight of wedding presents, made
a stately setting for the after-tamasha.
Mrs. Syme topped black lace and satin
with a picture hat in black and gold. Mrs.
Peacock, who, with daughter Stephanie, had
come from England for the event, trailed
graceful hangings of black and white, livened
by a dash of gold; Stephanie colored the
landscape with cherry georgette. At the
cake-cutting in the pink-lined marquee Judge
Williams orated brightly and J. Iv. Merritt
pleaded guilty to having brought the pair
together on an ocean voyage. The ’groom
is carrying his bride off to tread the matri-
monial way in Staffordshire, where his dad
does big business.
The bridesmaids, squired by a young man
apiece, ended up the day of thrills with a
theatre party to Betty, epilogued by a jazz
at Admiralty House. Joan and cousin
Nancy Syme are something different in flap-
perdom; they carry two thick plaits hanging
down their backs.
“So This Is London” arrived in Melbourne
on Saturday night with great swank. Lady
Forster was there to greet it, accompanied
by two blue-lapelled aides and her distin-
guished guest from England. The house was
packed with regular first-nighters, and dis-
played a profusion of shingled heads and
only one or two back-dated ladies sporting
a coil. The play is a bright and breezy
affair, even if it leads to no conclusion.
Hiram Draper (Thurston Hall > makes an
attractive “popper” to the Junior Draper
(Leslie Barry), who shakes a wonderfully
marcelled poll. Elinor Beauchamp (Mary
Macgregor) wore something green, and. put
up a fair representation of an elegant pray-
ing mantis. Lady Duckworth (Ailsa Gra
hame), the beauty of the piece, rolled ex-
pressive eyes, and wore many swagger gar-
ments. Gladys Webster, as Mrs. 11. Draper,
donned something quaintly suggestive of a
black and white marble mantelpiece. Beat-
rice Day, as a titled dame, splashed in the
limelight, and shared in the liberal applause
that followed Thurston Hall’s ultimate
speech, which was thrown across the usual
barricade of gift vegetation. Conspicious
in the stalls was “Lightniu’ ” O’Hara, and
Dr. Springthorpe hung prominently over the
dress-circle. General Monasli viewed the
proceedings three seats from the orchestral
front in the company of a prodigious feather
fan—probably there was a lady behind it
somewhere.
Melody night at Carlyon’s drew crowds
on to the jazz floor, in expectation of sur-
prise packets. The largesse came like manna
from Heaveti when, at 10 o’clock, two mon-
ster umbrellas hiding the ceiling furled them-
selves suddenly and showered jazz toys and
nodding balloons. The greediest snatched
handfuls, leaving the less speedy empty-
handed. Shouts of applause rent the air
when crick':' ?' O-egory neatly fielded two
bottles which still clung to the collapsed
brollies.
The New Gallery above Robertson and
Mullens’s was thickly peopled with the Very
Nicest one afternoon last week, when the
Edward Miller dame unveiled a show of
Gladys Owen’s paintings. Some were there
out of compliment to the artist’s war record,
which earned her an 0.8. E.; and others per-
haps because she is the daughter of a Sydney
Judge. Gladys was a slim silhouette in
black crepe with red roses flirting on the
ledge of her black hat. In the crowd were
Chief Justice Irvine’s lady, the Russell and
Frank Clarkes, the Barrett and Spencer
dames, th<> Charles Bage pair. Charles
Wheeler, Dr. Deeper and Irene Vanbrugh.
The art world presumably went next day.
General Brudenell White, who has been
understudying the veteran Henry Collins as
president of Alfred Hospital Auxiliary, wel-
comed the wanderer back from his English
jaunt at a tea-spread in the Botanical Gar-
dens. Mr. Collins, who looks younger than
ever after his trip, fielded a bombardment of
verbal posies. Most of the inviteds were
members of the Auxiliary Council, a notable
absentee being Mrs. Rupert Downes, who
helped to organise the movement: ill-healtli
was her excuse. The General wms supported
by his wife in a silky-brown dress under
a wide-brimmed hat with ostrich-feather
fronds around the brim. With them was
their flapper daughter, tailored in navy with
a natty little hat of powder-blue. Mrs. James
Angus and Mrs. Irwin, daughter of the late
General Downes, and well-liked Matron
Mann were also there.
Modern Melbourne has never seen' 'so
many top-hats together as at the Peacock-
Syme wedding. They dazzled. And be it
said the wearers were as highly polished
as the hats.
Mrs. Agar Wynne and her daughter, the
late Major Manser’s widow, combined to
cheer the elder Manser girl, Peggy, to her
matrimonial plunge with Reg Knowles
Kempton, at a tea-drinking in the Wynnes’
roomy Halcyon parlors. The rout gained
in both variety and avoirdupois by having a
couple of dozen male guests. Mrs. Wynne
was in silky dove-grey lace; her daughter
stood by in black crSpe weighted with
colored embroideries and a hat tinted like
new-mown hay. The bride-elect, convoyed
by the intending ’groom, was a ripple of
blue silk overhung by a dusky cloud. Mrs.
Pauli Carter had compiled the musical menu
on the backs of small fans, with Norman
Bradshaw’s fine tenor and Lorna Reid’s
songs at the piano as the hors-d’oeuvres. Tea
foamed in the dining-room, where the table
was freighted with the garden’s choicest
spoils. The Rev. Knowles Kempton, who
had crossed from Maoriland to help seal son
Reg’s contract, was busy getting acquainted
with his future daughter-in-law.
Several of us are making ourselves heard
through the London Fog. The forthcoming
opera season at Covent Garden is well
starred with Australian names, headed by
Florence Austral. Wilma Berkeley is to gee
her first London limelight next month, with
a recital at the Wigmore Hall. On the
dramatic side, Rose Duong is said to have
made a hit with various managerial heads,
is even quoted as the coming Bernhardt, and
is having an Oriental play written around
her in which she will face her first English
audience. Cahill and Brooke are making
brighter music-halls. Gertrude Johnson has
tuned up. Her lucky day was when Dorothy
►Silk fell on the sick list and she was en-
gaged to sing in Bach’s Passion at Easter for
the Philharmonic Society. Tom Minogue
steady work to do in the provinces.
Mrs. Horatio Webb, here looking at you,
is one of the brightest lights of the Austral
Salon, and has made out its balance-sheets
for the past 10 years. Her sister Salonites
eonsider her
the mascot of
the slxo w,
especially since
the building
was destroyed
by fire during
her r e cent
absenceabroad.
She is off again
shortly just in
time to miss
the opening of
the new Salon
w h i c h has
ai'isen on the
ashes of the
old. However,
she promises
not to stay
away for more
thaii a year,
wherefore
Salon members
will wave her
a cheerful farewell, and hope for the best.
Mrs. Webb is a sister of actor Fred Esmelton.
The wife of the kirk’s meenister at
Bacchus Marsh started to repair the well-
thumped pulpit cushion. Putting her hand
into its interior she pulled out an old bundle
of papers. One was a copy of the Age dated
November 30, 1865, then threepence a copy.
More interesting, however, was an envelope
bearing the inscription: “If you open, you
will find a relic of the past.” Inside she
found a slip of paper on which had been
written: “Thursday, in the Manse, on 30tn
November, 1865,” and four locks of hair,
tied with red wool and sewn to slips of
paper. On the papers were the names of
the four ladies to whom the locks belonged
—Mrs. Scott (the then minister’s wife),
Mrs. Rae, Mrs. Young and Miss McOutcheon.
Of these four only Mrs. Scott survives. She
lives at Sandy Hook, in Tasmania, and
although now 91 is still vigorous.
News comes from Singapore of the wed-
ding at St. Andrew’s of Alberta W. Pearce,
only daughter of the late Edward Albert
Pearce, of these parts, with Robert V. Wal-
ton, of the Standard Oil Co. The bride’s
mother, now Mrs. G. S. Lovett, greeted some
hundred guests at the reception. Handed on
by her stepfather, the bride was in ivory
georgette silver-embroidered, and defied the
worst with a pale green lining to a train of
silver tissue, a touch of color which brongnt
up the lights in her Titian hair. Both brides-
maid and wee train-bearer were nicely in the
picture in apparel of pink georgette, tulle
and silver lace.
Members of the Returned Army Nurses
Club extended the glad hand over the door-
step of their Anzac House to the British War
Office’s Matron-in-Cliief Anne Beadsmore
Smitli the other day. The place had burst
into flower, and violiniste Gertrude Alger
had been beckoned in to punctuate the
chatter with her fiddle. The room resounded
with the clank of decorations. On the star
guest’s breast the S’African Queen’s Medal
crashed against the Star of Jerusalem, and
a British Empire medal chimed with one
from France. Madge Donellan handed the
visiting angel a red posy; and the Edward
Miller dame, secretary Philadelphia Robert-
son and Mrs. Davie Grant were there to
represent the Red Cross Society.
The beautiful girl with “the little curl
right down the middle of her forehead,” pic-
tured here by 'Broothorn, is Grace Glover, a
clever little Aussie mummer, who lately
twinkled in the
locally - manu-
factured movie,
“The Mystery
of a Hansom
Cab,” and is
now a bright
circumstance in
the Midnight
Frolics at the
Palace Theatre.
Gracie comes
of old theatri-
cal stock. Her
parents, Peter
Savieri and
Julia Better •
ton-Glover, are
both wel 1-
known local
stage lights,
and her grand-
father, Gus
Glover, was a
leading Aus-
tralian actor. Both the Bettertons and Glovers
date their theatrical ancestry back to the
Restoration. Glover and Betterton streets,
hard by Drury-lane, commemorate the fact.
The return of Alice Henry to Melbourne
after 20 years’ absence in Chicago is being
hailed as an event by half a dozen different
groups. The white-haired, enthusiastic lady
was a leader in the ranks of both feminism
and Labor. In Chicago she managed to com-
bine the two by working for the Women’s
Labor movement. Her careful book, “Th<s
Trade Union Woman,” published some years
ago, has been followed by another on the
same line. Its facts are, of course, all
American. The same kind of book is badly
needed here, and the Trades Hall would be
glad of an Alice Henry to write it. Pacifists,
too, are enormously interested in what she
has to tell about the Peace movement in
America. There are those, like the famous
Jane Addams, of Chicago, who think that
America has not been called Columbia for
nothing, and that the overdue Dove of Peace
may be loosed from that quarter.
Women automobilists helped to oil the
stiff wheels of the social giddy-go-round
last week with a dispensation of tea, chatter
and music at their clubrooms. Dr. Nihill,
Walter Kirby and a few others of the
trousered sex braved the petticoated sea to
hear Isabel Langland exercise her fiddle as a
prelude to a farewell recital before she
migrates to the Old World. Dr. Bartoliui
sang, lion. sec. Mrs. Troedel bustled, and
president Mrs. J. 11. Robertson beamed over
a sheaf of presentation blossoms.
Frankston has succeeded where Toorak
failed, and has launched a Country Club of
the kind one reads about in high-toned
American novels. The organisers were lucky
in getting the thing ready-made. It had
started as a palatial golfing hostel, but
failed, and Frankston’s best-gilded bought it.
Members crowded in from all parts. Sport
of every denomination, from jazz to sea-
bathing, is provided, and golf and tennis
may be played in company with the moon,
the stars and powerful arc-lights; and there
are 50 bedrooms. The chief conspirators
are Prime Minister Bruce, Charles Bright.
General Grimwade and brother Russell and
Norman Brookes. Toorak’s effort was a
horrid dud. A place was bought, but as
nobody was found thirsting to shoulder the
financial responsibilities it was sold again.
The promoters gnashed their teeth when the
new owner promptly resold the place at a
few thousands more than he had paid for it.
England’s new poor are finding it harder
every day. Lady Ursula Blackwmod, daugh-
ter of the late Marquis of Dufferin, and Lady
Rosemary Boote Wilbraham, sister of the
Earl of Latham, are billed to sing at a six-
penny “pop” in Clerkenwell. In the daytime
Lady Ursula, who is a niece of our ex-G.-(L’s
wife, Lady Novar, and sister to little Lady
Pat Blackwood, sells notions over the coun-
ter of her fashionable London shop. The
American mother of the two has provided for
herself by marrying a not unwealthy peer,
bnt her daughters prefer to raise their own
dress allowances.
Actor Frank Dunn and his wife returned
from the Cold Country last week. They
went over to see the folks and have a “real
English Christmas” once more, returning by
way of Canada. A couple of years
ago Frank Dunn played the nervy gent,
in "Bulldog Drummond,” who has the vapors
as soon as the curtain rises, and finally shoots
himself. A kind lady told him one night that
he was very nice and all that, you know, but
in her opinion he didn’t shoot himself soon
enough.
The Argus Spowers have said “Bless you,
my children,” to their youngest daughter,
Myra, and John Keats, of Albury. Myra is
a sister of clever little artist Rosa, who
latelv returned from an art polishing on the
other side of the equator.
The latest expression of the shingle, now
threatening this country, is the short haircut,
which looks as if it came straight from a
prison barber’s scissors. For hideousness
nothing but a closely shaven poll could beat
it. Women, however, are not worrying so
much about the cut of their hair nowadays
as the shape of their figures. These must
resemble an athletic schoolboy’s. Feminine
curves are frowned on and contours “melted
down” with rubber stays aiid checked with
stout straight jackets of boned linen. Un-
comfortable of course, but one gets used to
it. A brighter tendency is the move in Lon-
don to popularise plus-fours instead of skirts
for feminine tennis-players.
Mrs. John Jones, who of all the
women candidates seemed likeliest to do
something at the next Federal elections, has
withdrawn. The Women’s Citizen Move-
ment put her forward for Fawkner; but the
idea that the espousal of politics by the
parson’s wife would make trouble in the
congregation which keeps the Bast St. Ivilda
Anglican Church going caused a meeting of
the vestry to be hurriedly convened; and there
the lady heard arguments which led to her
withdrawal.
As was evident from the time the exact
damage by fire became known, the City
Council is going to have the concert hall
reconstructed. The city engineer is to go
ahead with expert architectural assistance.
The discussion about new sites was merely
academic. Melbourne is too fond of the pre-
sent holy ground to give it up.
Sister Adelaide’s innings :
The Stokes-Stokes wedding—she the daughter of
the F. H. Stokes couple of Glenelg, and he the son
of the late Charles Stokes of W.A.—was staged in
St Peter’s, Glenelg, before a few relations and inti-
mate friends. The bride hung white satin with a
glimmer of palest pink and a cloudy tulle veil. The
bride’s father, with Mr. Hewgill, tied the knot.
Brother Edward gave her away, and two tiny pink-
clad Stokeses and Catherine Gilbert ’maided.
Enid Besanko, the Allan Wilkie co.’s songstress,
hails from the region of “Munta” and Wallaroo, and
has been studying under Madame Delmar Hall. The
piano is a second string—for some years she has
accompanied the Thousand Voices Choir.
The Clement Phillipson £20,000 has been ear-
marked for his wife and daughter during their life,
and subsequently for the grand-children, after which
it goes in trust to the University as the Clement
Phillipson Fund for Original Research in Agriculture.
The National Council of Women isn’t going to
let Mrs. Allen sit about during the couple of days
she will be in this village. Mrs. T. R. Bowman,
the Council’s president, will be her hostess, and a
heap of engagements await her.
Brain-waves from this State are travelling north-
wards to wish Edith Birks luck at the helm of the
Lady Sid—-by the tim e this is in print we’ll know
how much effect they’ve had. It is a far cry from
running an art school to steering a racing hydro-
plane, but Edith does them equally well.
C. B. Jennings takes up the secretarial pen of the
Polo Association that W. G. Tate has dropped. He
will also run the affairs of the Adelaide Polo Club.
The committee of the Soldiers’ Cemetery is asking
the Government to give it absolute control of the
Diggers’ portion of the West-terrace burial-ground,
chiefly so that free burial may be given to soldiers
without affidavits as to poverty from their relatives.
The Trust has collected and invested £6OOO, and
already looks after the graves of 178 men, while
about 100 unknown soldiers buried in other parts
cf the cemetery have still to be re-interred in the
Soldiers’ corner. Peace and beauty breathe oyer
this exquisitely-kept Garden of Memory, w T hich is
the first of its kind in Australia.
We are soon to have a firm of skirted solicitors—-
Mary Woods {nee Kitson) and Dorothy Somerville
are puting out an office-mat with “Welcome” on it. ( lt
will be'the former’s second partnership since Decem-
ber, when she signed up for life with Julie Woods,
who himself is a lawyer, incidentally, ex-soldier
Gordon Pavy, another Adelaide solicitor, has an
articled clerk further secured to him by the bonds
of matrimony.
The Boys’ Home at Walkerville has well over half
the £6OOO it wants for its new building. In the
past 40 years boys innumerable have gone through
its hands, and none of them leave till the com-
mittee is satisfied about the conditions of the job
they are being sent to. ;

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

SILK
STOCKINGS
Amy Castles, in a clinging robe of leaf-green,
beaded in crystal, with a spray of pink roses
embroidered from waist line to hem, made a
big success of the first of her concei ts a
the Town Hall on Saturday night. It is
some time since the brilliant smgei was
heard in Sydney, and her voice had a cer-
tain element of surprise m its power and the
beauty of its tones, as well as in the artistry
with which it is used. Hearing the voice
in the duet, with Cappelli, from Madame
Butterfly,” one marvelled afresh at the ex-
clusion of this songbird from the opcia co.
which Melba lately led to Sydney. Amy
manages her big, beautiful, healthy notes
in such fashion that, even in the weightiest
dramatic pasages, there is ever the sugges-
tion of reserve power, a very pleasant sensa-
tion for an audience. Sister Eileen, an
attractive little lady, was in a glistening
beaded robe of cosmos pink. lhe flexi-
bility of her voice is one ot its most allur-
ing qualities.
Members of the Union Frangaise fore-
gathered at a dance at Sargent s on I rulay
night to say au revoir to Consul-General tor
Belgium Henri Segaert, Mrs. Segaert and
daughter Henriette before they leave tor their
native • land. Incidentally, there was a
souvenir of their useful stay in these parts,
in the shape of a silver tea- and coffee-
service, Mr. Dontrebande making the accom-
panying remarks. Outside his consular
duties. Mr. Segaert has been responsible for
several well-produced plays for the Belgian
Benevolent Society and other charities, ui
which his daughter gave valuable help. The
gay party was charmingly frocked. Drap-
erics of lacc upon georgette of royal blue
formed Mrs. Segaert’s apparel, while her
mademoiselle exhibited a bounce of the new
flare mode upon a tube frock of jade-green
marocain. Mrs. Nihottc. wife of the Acting-
Consul-General, came in a gown of saxe
blue beaded artistically.
Kate Rooney got a welcome-home as warm
as the night from members of the Catholic
Women’s Association on Thursday at their
headquarters. Mayoress Cecilia Walsh, a
study in soft pink. and. incidentally, a founda-
tion member of the C.W.A., came along to
say “Pleased to see you back” to the con-
tralto; and president Mrs. John Barlow gave
Kate the freedom of the association, so to
speak, with an honorary membership. When
visible through the crowded room the decora-
tions were seen to be purple asters. and gum-
tips. Guests included some song-maidens from
the Garcia school, at which musical centre
the contralto’s notes got their first pruning
under Madame Christian. Winnie Howard,
Fanny Bauer and tenor Alfred O’Shea sang,
and in thanksgiving the guest used up some
of her mellow notes in a few old favorites.
St. James’s was the scene of the wedding
on Monday night of attractive Audrey Pick-
burn, only daughter of the late Judge Pick-
burn, and Mrs. Pickburn, of Springfield,
Darlinghurst. with Jack Faviell. youngest
son of Mrs. Faviell, of Studley Royal, Kirri-
billi —the late Arthur Flaviell, the bride’s
father, held much fat pasture lands around
Narrandera. There was a lot of elaborate glad-
ragging, and the woman in the street found
the sight better than a mannequin parade.
H. A. Russell took the bride to the altar;
she was in a tuniced gown of white satin
with pearl and crystal embroideries, touches
of pink beneath a silver train, and etceteras
in the way of a tulle veil and a bouquet of
white and gold orchids. A trio of brides-
maids gleamed in gold lame and scarves of
ethereal blue, with picture hats a-tune, and
added sheaves of yellow chrysanthemums to
the harvest-moon effect. The bride’s mother,
swathed in grey georgette, with a dash of
Oriental color and black picture millinery,
welcomed a host of Society, of which much
was legal, at the rejoicing in the Queen’s
Club. A trip 'to England is included in the
honeymoon.
Sheathed in white satin that had a fringe
of silk tulle, with depending crystal beads
and rhinestones, a Limerick-edged tulle veil
and an armful of pink lilies, pretty Marjorie
Mongomerie, youngest daughter of the late
Hugh Mongomerie and Mrs. L. Mongomerie,
of Winbin, Cowra, said the expected few
words to William Buchanan, of Rushcutter’s
Bay, last week at St. Stephen’s. Niece
Janette Buchanan, who ’maided in a frock
the hue of a new penny, was a whisper of
autumn, and so were the table decorations at
the Carlton, where Mrs. Mongomerie, with a
bouquet of crimson roses against a jet-embroi-
dered black gown, extended the welcoming
hand. Daughters Mrs. Robinson, in a mara-
bout-adorned frock of Persian red, and Mrs.
Cyril Thompson, in wisteria and silver, gave
their help; and other small-part players were
Dr. G. R. P. Hall and Dr. Woodburn.
Two Bachelors of Science have agreed on
a life partnership. They are Margery Hol-
land, B.Sc., daughter of the G. T. Hollands
of Summer Hill, and Pat, younger son ot
Papua’s Governor Murray and his little lady.
The young man, who is acquiring a tail of
learned letters, did a brilliant . course at
Oxford, won a Macleay Fellowship, and mow
pursues research in biology at Sydney var-
sity with Professor Sands. Cards are
passing through the post for the wedding on
March 14.
So many candidates for royal honors are
wandering around the city that the unsus-
pecting citizen knows not who is his enemy,
or from what sunshine bag or trouser pocket
may come a book of tickets, whose sale
will place the sceptre in some lily-white
hand for one night only. Evidently spurred
on by the success attending the Force’s
efforts at queen-making, the Hospital Satur-
day collectors, who will gather the stray
coins of the million on May 1, suggest a
Call-me-early Queen, with the May-day
frolics of Marne England. Meantime the
wearied housewife begins to dread even the
coming of the milkman.
Doctors and ministering angels attached
to the Mater Misericorduc put up at Mauresa
Hall on Monday night the smartest dance
yet held there. The takings wer.t to assist
the hospital's candidate, Mrs. P. Leahy, to
top the score in the Police Carnival Queen
competition. Beneath garlands of salmon-
pink roses and silver umbrellas a full house
one-stepped to the alluring music of the
police jazz orchestra.
Pianist Beatrice- Tange, appearing this
week at the Haymarket Theatre, is demon-
strating that good music intelligently pre-
sented will “go big” with movie patrons. It
seemed a bit of a risk to offer a Saturday
night audience a Caprice bv Dolmanvi (he
taught Levitzki), and, with tlie orchestra,
two movements of the Grieg Concerto, but
the young player’s vigorous manipulation and
clear tone kept a packed house more than
interested. The pianist, a good double of
the Bananaland actress Mary MacGregor,
was a study in gold even unto stockings and
shoes; primrose-shaded lamps gleamed upon
her red-gold locks against a black-curtained
background as she sat at Beale’s best piano.
The revival of “Trelawny of the Wells” next
Saturday night, after over 20 years’ silence,
brings to memory the fact that Mrs. Tange,
then Beatrice Moffett, was the attractive
ingenue of the first performance in Austra-
lia.
The Young Australia League got a finan-
cial lift from a dance-tea at the_ Ambassa-
dors on Friday, secretarjed by Misses Lane
and Bourne. Marie Burke, who came under
the escort of Gus Bluett, sang between steps
and sips, and later showed promise in the
new role of auctioneer. To her Old-World
frock of ivory lace, pink sashed, she gave
a modern touch with a black hat that waved
a near-paradise plume. Premier Fuller s
dame, president of the League, came with
daughter Gwen, who featured the new tas-
selled millinery, worn with a hand-painted
ivory georgette frock.
Mrs. Roystone Davey is the suave and
capable honorary secretary of St. Luke’s,
the Anglican hospital in Darlinghurst.
Though originally of Sydney she lived
for man y
years in Mel-
bourne, where
she went as a
bride; and for
eight years of
her residence
in the south,
St. George’s,
M e 1 b o u rue’s
equivalent of
St. Luke’s, was
enriched b y
her tact and
enthusiasm. In
Sydney she has
become a most
popular com-
mittee woman:
she has not
only shep-
herded St.
Luke’s since it
was a few
months old, but
is also the secretary and treasurer of the
Woollahra branch of the District Nursing
Association, and a pillar of the Victoria
League and the Bush Book Club. Mr. and
Mrs. Davey sail for Europe early in April.
Dr. Mary Booth has enlisted the sym-
pathies of Mrs. Guy Bates Post for her pre-
sent pet scheme of preventing the site of
the big P.F.A. fire from becoming merely
residential, instead of being turned into a
park for the children to play in, as she and her
fellow-workers of the Open Spaces move-
ment desire. The wife of the popular actor,
having taken part in such reforms in
America, was much in her element when
she addressed a meeting at Beaumont House
last week. The lady put up a good plea for
the park, incidentally paid a compliment to
the efficiency of Sydney's presswomen and
tlie healthy tone of journalism here, and
made a happy suggestion that we should
have a club for visiting actresses. But hap-
pier still was her proposal that it should
bear the name of our Sweet Nell.
Lyric-soprano Gertrude Concannon has
gone the way of all vocalists and published a
ditty, quite melodious and attractive —“At
Evening.” The new song is being well used
in Gertrude’s own Bananaland. The young
vocalist, of agreeable looks and manner and
liquid gallery notes, intends to take her
talents across to America in search of fame.
But that won’t be till about the middle of the
year.
Wave a fin to Clare Couldwell, the gal-
lant captain of the North Bondi Ladies’ Swim-
ming and Life Saving Club. Clare is the
mermaid to
whom the swim-
ming eyes of
Sydney turn.
She started
winning cham-
pionships in
1922. won four
in 1923, and
the same num-
ber in 1924;
in addition she
held the An-
nette Iveller-
man Cup in
1922, and won
the Royal Life
Saving Award
of Merit in
1923. She
holds the State
titles for 880,
440 and 220
yar d s, and
though beaten
by the Hawaiian visitor Marieschen Welise-
lau, the Bondi girl was not eclipsed, not-
withstanding that she was in the throes of
an attack of ptomaine poisoning. She is
going to Victoria to represent her State in
the Australian championships. May Moore
made the picture for us. You’ll see she
doesn’t look more than 17, and she isn’t.
As Sydney is to soon see a whole con-
stellation of visiting stars, local artists are
getting in early, before the regular concert
season begins. Among the first of these
recitals is Julia Caroli Fossati's, at the Adyar
Hall, this (Thursday) night. Papal Dele-
gate Cattaneo, an old friend of Fossati, is
expected to bring his most effective millinery.
Twenty-six Press ladies gave the glad
hand to Amy Castles and sister Eileen at
the Mary Elizabeth last Thursday. There
were posies for the guests, and a pleasant
hour was spent over tea and ices and reminis-
cences.
Ruby Coxhead and her Vagabonds start
this year on their career of usefulness by
producing Haddon Chambers’s comedy. “The
Saving Grace,” at St. James’s Hall for the
benefit of the Bush Book Club (March 18».
for the Clerical Women War Workers’ funds
(19) and the Vagabonds’ cot in “Scarba”
(21).
Lady de Chair is giving a hand to a
Cabaret at the Wentworth next Tuesday to
take a few ounces off a debt of £12.000
which hangs over the schools of St. Bede's,
Pyrmont, and St. Francis Xavier’s. I Homo.
Marie Burke, of “Wildflower,” Monica Mack,
from “Rosie O’Reilly,” Eileen Boyd ami
Beresford Shaw are to help in the enter-
taining. Florrie Howard, whose name is
associated with the organising of many suc-
cessful Rose Days, is lion, secretary.
Hubert Henry Davies is the playwright
whom the Players’ Club will present in “The
Mollusc” at St. James’s Hall to-morrow
(Friday) night. This society, yet in its
infancy, calls for recognition, for its mem-
bers are enthusiasts who take themselves
and their author very seriously.
That curious brand of loyalty to the
Throne, so strongly marked in people who
want it to be forgotten that the-family for-
tune owes its origin to a successful fish-and-
chips shop or something similar, has a strong
hold on one pretty prominent family. The
absence of the heads of tlie clan from a
recent performance was noted by a friend
and commented on when next she met the
patrician dame. “Oh, my dear,” the reply
came, “my husband and I couldn’t possibly go
and enjoy ourselves with these alarming
cables coming through about the dear King’s
health!” Her friend admits an impulse to
cable an account of the incident to Bucking-
ham Palace. She feels sure it would cheer
them all up.
Feminine apparel for the autumn pro-
mises to be very much knitted. Wonderful
advance has been made in the design of
these goods, with the result that the price
of machine-made purl-and-plain two-piece
suits reaches the figure demanded for a well-
tailored cloth. The smart outfits are in
any number of modes, but though they may
be long or short of coat, you may always
expect them to be trimly belted and pocketed,
and to be worn with the short tube-like
skirt. The cool weather will find the coat-
and-skirt costume reinstated; there are some
delightful sporty tweeds to be had. This
should give the long-in-fashion one-piece a
rest; we shall cease to worry whether we
are right-way foremost in our gown, and
shall no longer have to indulge in the gym-
nastic feats required by the sheath. Re-
cently a tailor was greeted by an infuriated
customer in what seemed to be a glorified
strait-jacket. Between gasps for breath she
forcibly expressed her opinion of his talents.
The impeachment coming at length to an
end, the man of few word* remarked that
the garment was not meant to be worn back
to front. Luckily the lady was not quite
bare of humor, and peace and comfort re-
turned with the right-about-face of the gown.
Mrs. Becke. widow of Louis, the South
Seas writer, left for London in the Ben-
digo. 11 or daughter, who has written some
graceful verse for Tin-; Bulletin, and has
been for some time on the Inky Way in
Sydney, is with her, and hopes to get a
footing on the London press.
By the death of Mrs. Mary Stewart Cox.
Grafton has lost an old inhabitant and
L’ ederal Treasurer Page a grandmother. The
old lady, 04 when she died, met her husband,
Edwin Cox, a diver who was brought to
Australia to lift specie from.a wreck, on the
ship in which she came to Australia in 1852.
The couple, after sampling the Bendigo dig-
gings, came on to N. S. Wales and settled
at Grafton. That was 70 years ago. With
such roots in the soil, no wonder Earle Page
has a firm hold on his northern electorate.
Chinaman’s luck is a poor thing compared
with that which seldom fails to hover about
small boys engaged in perilous enterprises. The
other day the conductor of a tram that had
pulled up at Circular Quay asked the driver
to wait until he got some coppers at the
office. Coming back he was about to hop
on when he saw the feet of a diminutive
urchin protruding from under the car be-
tween two of the wheels. The kid explained
when he was yanked out that he had gone
under after a penny which had rolled there.
Only the momentary wait, for change had
saved him from being bisected.
Marie Burke, who has made such a suc-
cess in “Wildflower,” the musical play with
an Italian background, absorbed her atmo-
sphere in the land of Spaghetti and Opera
itself. She was 44 years studying singing
in Milan, and that’s why she brings into the
play such an air of dolcc fur niente, questa
o quella and so forth—anyone who knows
better Italian for it can have it her own
way.
Miners up Newcastle wav have a new
grievance. They object to being medically
examined by Dr. May Harris, the Govern-
ment Medical Officer in the coaly city.
Some who have received injuries in "minor
accidents are even abandoning their compen-
sation claims rather than submit to examina-
tion by her. “It isn’t fair 1 to expect a man
to let a woman examine him,” they say. The
vice versa of the case has apparently never
struck them.
Two Sydneyites are creeping into the
London papers. They are “Snowy” Baker,
who is flashing his pleasant teeth and stunt-
ing in “The White Panther,” produced by
the British Empire Film Corporation, and
Marie Bentivoglio. Marie is the girl who
proved at the Sydney Uni. that she knew so
much about crystallography that she was
awarded an 1851 travelling scholarship—
the first Australian woman to get one. She
is now investigating the growth of crystals
and their structure in Oxford, under the
supervision of Professor Barker.
Brisbane’s postscript:—
The Diggers of Cremorne met Marieschen Wehse-
lau, the Hawaiian swimmer, in her natural element
at Pat Hanna’s private swimming bath during the
week. Misses Thompson and Yenning, local cham-
pions, and some members of the Ladies’ Swimming
Association also swam.
At Toowoomba last week his Ex. ate the salt
of Dr. and Mrs. /Eneas McDonnell; also lie officially
unlocked the Wynnum Golf Club’s doors.
Elsie, daughter of Assembly Speaker Bertram, was
married to Harold, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Lowes, of East Brisbane, at the Mowbraytown Kirk.
The bride, in a tunic frock of ivory satin beaute,
was attended by three slim maids in dainty frocks
of cream mariette and ivory lace. Noosa sees the
honeymoon.
His Ex. starts on a big tour of Bananaland at the
end of March, following the • map of Queensland
round about Camooweal and nearer home, and re-
turning in June. Last week; he dined the Glynn
Connollys and other pals at Government House, and
had Mrs. Willie Collins staying there before her
departure for Sydney. In spite of shade tempera
tures up to 100, he has kept going in his good
way. If it be true that he leaves us in October,
there will be only regrets and good wishes to follow
him.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
With Heroic, The Night Patrol and The
Hawk among the acceptors, class was well repre-
sented in the 28th Futurity Stakes at Caulfield,
and the V.A.T.C. got its £3500 back with interest.
McShortodds was anxious to lay Heroic and The
Night Patrol—l2’s to 14’s the colt and B’s to 10’s
the Governor’s horse —but The Hawk was never
better than 2’s and Friarsdale and Father’s Voice
were firm at 4’s. It was a race of sudden forward
an I backward moves. Heroic, when leading with
Father’s Voice, on whom sat William Duncan, instead
of Dwyer, dropped back quickly, and The Night
Patrol took his place, only to close down immedi-
ately. Meanwhile The Hawk had been hemmed in
on the rails. At length Pike was able to get through,
but although the little champion finished gamelv
under liis lOst. 4lb„ his fellow-Maorilander Father’s
Voice, with 271 b. less, lasted long enough to win by
a head. Mercian King, with the same weight as
the winner, was only a neck behind The Hawk, and
the son of King Offa—Bunfeast must have a great
chance in the Newmarket on Saturday with only
7st. 3lb.
Although she had won over a longer distance the
previous week and was known to be consistent,
Demina, the little St. Spasa-Guinevere mare from
South Oss, was allowed to go out at 10’s for the
Woodcliffe Handicap. Lion Isle f2o’s) and Llan-
thony (7’s) ran respectably, as also did Jaekstaff
(an early winner) and Suomi; but Over the last
of the IX furlongs they had no chance with the
mare, who carried 9st„ lib. and defeated much
better animals than in the Bond Cup. Her Aus-
tralian Cup burden, including a 71b. penalty, is
Bst. slb. Valiard (3’s) was stopping badly at the
end of the Hawksburn Handicap, both Adrift (G’s)
and Skirling (20’s) beating him home, with Spear-
felt ouite a good fourth. Possibly the favorite
needed the race, but he’ll have to improve largely
if the Newmarket is to come his way.
On Caulfield running, Mercian King is the best
bet for the Newmarket. Adrift (7st. 101 b.) and
Whittier (9st. 111 b.) have chances also, and if
Whittier is as good as he was when he won the
Doncaster, finishing a long way ahead of horses
like The Monk and All Sunshine, he will take a
lot of stoushing with 61b. more. This page intends
dividing its 10 bob between Mercian King and
Whittier. Backwood is favorite for the Australian
Cup, mainly because of a sparkling finish in the
nine-furlongs St. George Stakes. He has 9st. 41b.
to hump over the long 18 furlongs, but he has
improved since November, and his staying capacity
is undoubted. Lemina won at Port Adelaide over
14 furlongs and could not be in fin?r condition.
Prince Woorak and Aecarak possess unquestionable
chances, too. If Lemina were a little more rugged-
looking one would not seek further for a bet, but
she is otilv a rat of a thing, and at a difference
of 131 b. Backwood may be expected to beat her.
“0.M.” : In 1919 I stood in the sale-ring at
Canterbury (M.L.) and saw The Hawk knocked down
to F. S. Rafchbone, acting on behalf of the, Douglas
Estate, foj; 180 guineas. Before Cameron bought
him the. gelded son of Martian—Sparrowhawk had
won /jr(5510 in stakes. For Cameron he has netted
between ,£ 11,000 and £12,000, and perhaps as much
agfljn in bets. And he looks good for another couple
of seasons yet.

Few Sydney sprinters can (show their
lieels to Bathos when the Absurd—Amyrin bay is
at bis best. After a well-deserved and much-needed
spell, the ex-Maorilander is cherry-ripe again, an 1
he proved it on Saturday by breaking up a big
field in the Flying Handicap at Moorefield. Wood-
ville was favorite (Bathos was at 10’s), but he turned
it up after the big bay had worried him out of
the lead early, and Bathos went on to win com-
fortably by two lengths from the Baverstock mare
Encre, who likes Rand wick better than Moorefield,
and Narrogin. Bernesk did no good at headquarters
during the January meetings, but the stable got a
lot of its money back in the Moorefield Handicap,
the Bernard—Eskdalmuir mare having the better of
an interesting struggle with the topweight, Farceur.
She started at 7 to 2. Backers began badly, the
first three races being won by outsiders, but well-
fancied horses collected the other five.
* * * *
J. McO. Williams, owner of Century Tire,
retained the Griffith Cup for Queensland in the race
for the Australian motor-boat championship on the
Brisbane River, and didn’t have to break 694 m.p.h.,
his craft’s best Australian time, in doing it. Tortoise
11., belonging to the S. Aus. Rvmills, led Century
Tire for about quarter of a mile—each carries a
450-h.p. Liberty motor—but the champion caught
up and they raced neck and neck for the first
turn —it was a 20-mile course, with four laps. Then
G.-Whil, a new Queensland boat specially built for
the race (it also had a 450-h.p. Liberty motor),
got into their backwash and sank, the crew being
picked up. Next Tortoise 11. developed engine
trouble and dropped behind, to be passed presently
by the other S. Aus. boat, Lady Sid, piloted by Miss
Napier Birks. Retaining her lead, Century Tire
won in 22min. 20sec., Lady Sid following in 24inin.
20sec., and Miss Albion, with her 250-h.p. engine,
bringing up the rear, Tortoise 11. having stopped.
Only Century Tire and Lady Sid started in the second
heat, and the higher-powered boat won easily in
26min. 40sec. So Williams took the Cup for the
second year, and a 40-guinea trophy was added by
Darcy Donkin, who had an unhappy shot for the
title himself in 1923.
* * * #
Elsternwick Park, once a haunt of utility
’orses and the gents who race them, and in
later years given over to Melbourne golfers, is about
to be converted into a general recreation ground.
So much of it as will do for a nine-hole course
will be- retained for golf (there are 80 acres alto-
gether), and, if the Brighton Council has its way,
bowling greens, tennis courts, croquet lawns, cricket
and football areas and a playground for kiddies will
he added. Lands Minister Downward, who lias the
final say, is impressed, hut is going to hear objections,
if any. It is due to the retiring golf club to say
that when it got a lease of the ground years ago
the place was mostly a swamp. Attempts to oust
the club'.before, it was ready failed, and now it has
another and bigger area down Cheltenham way.

ascendancy of Thye, who was top dog throughout.
He carefully avoided Karasick’s neekholds, and in
the sixth spasm got a toehold which made the
Russian, wincing with agony, signify that he yielded
the fall. In the eighth the Yankee nearly scored
again. There were hints of savagery in the first
meeting, but the second was fought in a most
courteous spirit. Too courteous for some people.
“Bill Bowyang” : I recently read a letter
received from Frank P. Slavin, great Australian
heavyweight of the ’eighties and earlv ’nineties.
The old-timer states that the Canadian Legion of
Veterans, at Victoria, 8.C., has recently provided
him with a home and some capital, as he is past
toil. Slavin did admirable work as a Canadian
soldier during the late war; he fought alongside
his son, who was killed only a few days before
the Armistice.
G. It. Parker, the N.S.W. walking cham-
pion, failed in his attemnt on the world’s ml-

corded to have walked a nvle at Melbourne on
Feb. 24, 1912, in 6min. 22 4-ssec.

“FY7”: In these days, when Town v.
Country competitions at bowls, cricket and other
sports are so popular, I have often wondered whether
a Saltwater v. Freshwater Fishermen’s debate would
not draw a good gate.
A sample of what Mud-
gee (N.S.W.) can do
was supplied the other
day. A man landed a
cod there, and when he
opened it a good-sized
crayfish, of the sort
known as Murrumbid-
gee lobsters, leapt out
of the catch’s interior
and skedaddled down
the bank into the river
again. The correspond-
ent who wired the yarn
to a Sydney paper says
he will vouch for the
happening': but lip may
be a fisherman himself.
JIM WALL,
president of
N.S.W. Bowling
Association.
No one will be greatly surprised if Gilli*
gan s men win the fifth Test match beginning on
the Sydney Cricket Ground to-morrow. Their dis-
plays in their last three matches have been Very
convincing, three or four men who shaped poorly
in December having struck their English form.
With four down for 175 (104 behind) and a good
pitch to bat on, the Australians plight have set
the visitors a hundred or two to make in the
fourth Test at Melbourne, but they could only
manage another 75, Tate getting 4 for 21—6 for
c 5 altogether. It was a feeble display of batting.
Coming to Sydney for the return match against
.. , e , s > the Englishmen knocked the bowling of
Scott, Ivelleway, Mailey and four others all over
the fiehl. Woolley got 145 in 154 minutes—a really
brilliant knock, Hendren 165 in 192 minutes, Sanct-
liam 187 and Bryan 72, the total being 026 in
44] minutes. Sandham was slower than the other
hree, but. his showing was that of a high-class
batsman in every sense of the word, his cutting,
leg-glancing and driving being beautiful. Me will
be a thorn in the side of the Australians when they
go to England. Oddly enough, Kippax was the
most successful bowler; after having 27 runs hit
off him the first day without taking a wicket, he
accounted for Whysall, Kilner, Freeman and Hendren
tor another 39. The youngster’s style recalls that
or the late Harry Trott, and he will be quite a
good bowler if he perseveres—as lie should. Kippax
and Grimmett have been included in the Australian
;V v ac ° ? f Bardsley and Arthur Richardson.
At the close of the second day’s play, N. S Wales
had . 1.64 on the board for the loss of one wicket,
Collins having made lot n.o. in 122 minutes by
beautiful cricket. An effective answer to the asses
who have been braying that he should have been
left out ot the last Test.
* * * *
“Treble”; Bowlers Capable of taking full
advantage of a sticky wicket are indeed rare in
Australia nowadays (B. 12/2/’?SV but in Bert Iron-
monger Victoria possesses a lefthander who could
rattle through any side on an English gluepot. Bert
is a Queenslander, but his bowling was so impressive
when he visited Melbourne with a Bananaland XI
years before the war that the M.C.C. snapped him
up. For some seasons after his change of residence
he starred as a pennant and inter-State bowler, but
when his awful batting and fielding did not improve
hi was dropped from Shield games for a worse
trundler who was better in the other departments.
Bert then went to Svdney, and while there headed
the grade bowling list, but soon St. Kilda lured
him back to Victoria. With the seasiders he again
took his place as the State’s best trundler by com-
fortably winning the pennant aggregate and average,
but his 59 wickets at 11 runs each did not gain
him another_ inter-State chance until a few weeks
ago, when Vic. had to put two teams in the field
against N. S. Wales. He made so much of this new
opportunity that his many faults were forgiven, and,
played against _ the Englishmen, he was the stock
bowler, yet his five wickets (including the hat
trick) cost only 93 in a score of 500. He is the
ideal bowler for English wickets, but as a bat is
about as useful to him as a broomstick, and as his
fielding is always a big bonus to opposing teams,
his chance of making the trip is remote.
* * * *
“H. JTnrdupp” : if the English authori-
ties have their way, Bob Crockett will go to Britain
for a couple of seasons at least. They have the
highest - opinion of Bob, and have commissioned Gilli-
gan to hand him a special invitation. Crockett,
who has been on the Melbourne C. O. staff for 37
years, started umpiring in 1887, and five years later
was one of the two white-coats in an England-
Victoria game. In 1902 he officiated in his first
Test match, and since then he has been a sort of
tradition.
“Macann”: The use of “hit on wicket”
and “thrown out” in newspaper reports of cricket
matches (B. 19/2/'25) is almost invariably followed
by country newspapers. M.v first editor gave me the
reason. “I have a complaint here,” he said, “from
the Wirrabilly club, about your report of Saturday’s
game. Thpv snv tW three chans von have as bowled
were out h.0.w.” “But,” I protested, “there is no such
thing as h.0.w.” “That’s got nothing to do with it,”
he told me. “Those three chaps are subscribers to
this paper.” I carried a list of subscribers in iriv
hip pocket after that.
* * * *
“F.W.F.” : While the third Test match was
dawdling along at Adelaide I arrived home with
the score just as Ah Pong was suoplving Matilda
with the week-end vegetables. Ah Pong glanced at
the paner and asked easrerlv. “How clickrt match:
our fellow win?” I told him that “our fellow” had
K’d made 489. Pong smip-d in hea*hrn way.
“Welly good,” he commented. “Engleeshmen no
catehee that. Glegley, him bowl ’em. Him be-i

* * * *
“G. 0.8,”; Ranjl Was no marvel at Cam-
bridge, bat it is quite incorrect to state that he
was hardly worth his place in that Uni.’s XI (B.
o/2/’26). He became known by some big scores in
college matches and should have been capped in 189->
before either G. ,J. Weigall or W. J. Rowell. How'
ever, he got his blue the next year, and proved a
good Uni. batsman, averaging during the season
29.9 with a top score of 58. In the slips he wa-
ul ways brilliant,

“Adelaide” : A vetci'an class in ladies’ ten-
nis is not likely to be popular; but South Australia
could make sonle striking nominations. Mrs. Rowe,
still one of our two or three very best, is the
mother of the man with Davis Cup possibilities
And in a pennant match to-day I saw the long-ago
Champion, Miss Parr, win her double in straight
sets, and hei‘ single in a hard-hitting three-set affan
in which she entirely out-stayed her young opponon*
Her age? I don’t know, But I do know that she
was admittedly-—it was before the days of formal
championships—the best woman player in Adelaide
in 1885.
* * * *
“Old T.”: Most of the Interest having de-
parted frotli cricket, Melbourne sport-followers are
getting ready for football, and club meetings are
as lively as Gilligan’s hones were three months ago.
As soon as the League collected the three Association
clubs—Footsc ray, North Melbourne and Hawthorn
into its fold, the Association heated up and talked
light, legal fight, but no one paid touch attention. The
disgruntled body’s latest counter-move, however, is a
beast of another hue. It lias come to some sort of
an agreement with the Motordrome people to have
’oofball played on the ’Drome arena on Saturday
and Monday nights. The ’Drome chiefs have circu-
larised 150 players belonging to various bodies,
setting forth that they propose to organise and
“Manage” senior football, conducting games at the
’Drome and several other grounds, strengthening
weak teams and pooling all receipts. All players will
be paid at a Hat rate, and £ 5 a week is offered as a
minimum wage. They further propose to maintain
two tame teams—to be called Melbourne City and
Richmond City—to fill a gap when others default
or something goes wrchg with the works. This writer
has his doubts about the success of the scheme. After
Watching one. strenuous game through a cold and
often wet winter’s afternoon, few will be eager
for another at night. Again, the typical football
crowd barracks for its team, whether it plays rotten
or prime, because it is the team belonging to the
suburb the bart’acker belongs to and has always sworn
by, This local appeal will he absent from the
Motordrome affairs. Also, to maintain 10 or 12 teams
on the proposed basis will require from £l5OO to
£2OOO a week, and as the League matches will cer-
tainly collect the cream first, the Ass. and ’Drome
gatoes won’t separate that much from the skim milk.
Hither the League must be squelched or the Ass. and
the ’Drome bosses will come a thud,
* * * , #
“Wink” : The treasurer of the Carlton
(Vic.) toeballers, telling off a heckler at a hostile
meeting, let in some light; on football finance.
When the Old Blues wel'e floundering an endeavor
was made to strengthen the team by securing a star
from Adelaide. The luminary was quite willing to
follow the money, but the South Oss authorities
refused to give him a clearance. The transaction,
though unsuccessful, cost Carlton £9O.
“Shrewsbury” : I refuse to credit “O.M.’s”
statement; that the All Blacks are disgusted with
the English Rugby Union, because of the latter’s
parsimony. The English R.U. has nothing to do
this trip with how the All Blacks travel; save for
expenses, paid without discussion on the manager’s
vouchers, the R.U. takes all the proceeds, under
formal agreement. So if the Maorilanders were
shoved into tiie second class “in steamers about the
coast” it was the doing of their own management,
though that they ever did so travel the writer does
not believe for a moment —even the trip to France
was done by aeroplane. Possibly the tourists crossed
the Mersey . by ferry from Birkenhead when they
went to Liverpool after the Cheshire match,, but
there _is only one class on those boats. The idea of
hawking them round the coast in non-existent
steamer lines when the cheap and almost perfect
English railway system was at command is certainly
brilliant and arresting. So with the assertion that
the visitors were made to feel that “in then' veins
did not flow the blood of Vere de Vere.” In Australia
R.U. teams are manned by all sorts and condi-
tions of men, and the same is true of the other
great Rugby countries, including Britain herself.
Outside the Universities, the game is played by
Swansea coppersmelters, Northampton bootclickers,
Headingley millhands and a hundred other folk
who have never heard of the De Vere caste, and
who are content to play the game for its own sake,
worrying neither about the boodle they don’t get nor
the Norman blood they haven’t got.
* * * *
“W.” : George Nenia, the M.L. full-back,
is an ingenuous child of nature. At 16, going from
his native village of Nuhalca (Hawkes Bay) to the
Maori Agricultural College at Hastings, he was
asked what subjects he would like to specialise in.
“Football and music,” was his reply. The minions
of the Eng. Northern League, who are said to have
offered him £l2OO to turn pro., must have found
him a tough nut. “But they not show me the
money,” he said, describing the negotiations to a
friend.
“Loud” : English professional Soccer form
works out very fine, under the scheme, now of many
years’ standing, which throws out the bottom two
League clubs at the end of each season, and pro-
motes the top two from the Second Division in
their stead. There is nothing like it to keep up
average form; nothing like it to promote interest,
either, since a club that halfway through a season
has no hope of the premiership cannot take things
easy—as almost any Australian club can, under any
code—but has to struggle even harder to avoid going
right out. As to the levelling-up of form, at the
end of December, with the season about half over
and 23 matches played, out of a possible 46 points
the best was West Bromwich Albion with only 32.
and others on its heels. Of the 22 clubs, 13 balanced
on the equality line, with from 26 to 20 points.
Preston North End, famous of old, looked booked for
going down. The position was very similar in the
Second League, with Derby County at the head,
and the others only a little less on a level than
in the First.
THE CHASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“At the Parramatta (X.S.W.) Police Court, two
motorists were fined for driving at a dangerous
speed along the Western-road. One admitted that
he was trying to break the Sydney to Brisbane
record ; the excuse of the other, who owned up to 40
miles an hour, was that he “wanted to catch a
party who owed him money.”
Mad pace one makes and records breaks for thrill or,
maybe, glory.
The chaps who rode from Ghent to Aix in Browniug’s
stirring story
Were galloping good news to bring. A stimulus that’s
better
When dusty miles behind you’d fling is an escaping
debtor.
There’s some pursue the bounding Too at speed not
even-tenored
Or pound along with shrill halloo behind resource-
ful Reynard.
Sonic spur their nags behind the drags—poor make
believe flapdoodle—
llis quarry wasn’t antlered stags, ’twas merely
flying boodle.
At speed to make policemen quake, upon theii
affidavit.
Some tear, unthinking, life to take, and some as
fast to save it.
liach highway feels the whirring wheels that previous
records master,
But he who’s on a debtor’s heels can olten travel
faster.
Revenge or love a car will shove along, and him
who’s in it,
At what may prove a bit above six furlongs to the
minute.
But who, aglow, will let her go with such a fierce
insistence
As one who sees his rightful dough receding in the
distance ?
Upon the road his wheels they slowed, they checked
his frantic sortie;
The line before the beak he toed and frankly owned
to forty.
He lost the chase—a piteous case! Now mulct in
fine he’s aching.
I’d rather like to know the pace the other bloke
was making !

Protection against the deadliest gases
C IMPLE in operation and comfortable to wear, Proto
Self-contained Oxygen Breathing apparatus is the
safest now available. Its use at the re-opening of the
Bellbird Colliery demonstrated this convincingly.
In five minutes an unskilled man becomes efficient in the working of
Proto equipment. Very little practice makes him expert in its use.
Wearing the Proto apparatus he can work in any position. It is so
compact that he can crawl through an opening 15 in. by 15 in. It
is so strong that risk of accident through damage to any part is obviated.
Full particulars about the equipment necessary for mine rescue-stations are
supplied on request. Proto demonstrations will be arranged when required.

THE INKY WAY.
“Coot”: A historic Fitzroy building of interest to
Inky-wayfarers has recently been demolished —a
small Milestone place at the corner of Moor and
Kent streets. Here used to be published the weekly
Observer, owned for a time by Graham Berry.
After having footed the Inky Way for half a
century, W. .1. Geddes, editor and managing director
of the N.Z. Times (Wellington) for the past dozen
years, has retired. In association with Mr. Blom-
field (“Bio”), a black-and-white artist, he established
the Observer, and later the same pair started the
Free Gance.
From the Wingham Chronicle (North Coast,
N.S.W.) :

Tom Glceson one of the several men who claimed to
have done the first process-engraving work in Aus-
tralia. If he wasn t actually the first he certainly
brought across some improved methods from America.
For a good many years past he had been on the
Evening News. As a side-line he made baseball a
live game on Sydney grounds.
“S.W.H.”: I know a Sydney cadet reporter as
ambidextrous as “Wai-hoi’s” Darwin half-caste (B.
22/l/’25) and perhaps even better equipped for
keeping his mind on two things at once. Some time
ago, when doing the Sydney wool-sales for his paper,
he would write the “intro” with one hand, while
he jotted down the details of the sales with the
other. Only those who have seen a wool-sale room
in full blast will know what sort of job that is.
“Amity”: The two Australian sisters Neville
Joske and Margot Goyder, who write as “Margot
Neville.” relate that a firm of English publishers
advised them that it was willing to consider
novels by Australians, provided the tales were not
“purely Australian.” The publishers candidly said
they had excellent Australian stuff submitted to
them, but turned it down in favor of fluffy little
train-journey trifles such as “Marietta Is Stolen,”
which deals with England and Italy, and novels of
the “Bachelor Betty” type. So don’t reproach the
struggling Australian if he flies to the ancestral
homes of England for copy.
“Bill Bowyang”: What are Diggers’ magazines
published in France and Egypt worth these days?
The 71 issues of Stars and Stripes, brought out by
the Americans in France during the war, are now
selling in U.S.A. for as high as £250 a file, and so
great has been the demand that reprints are being
issued. The most I have been offered for a complete
set of the Kia-ora Coo-ee, published by the A.I.F.
in Egypt, is £6, and a friend of mine was re-
cently offered £5 for a set of Aussie, published in
France. Considering that a complete file of these
magazines is war history, live and throbbing, with
all its pathos and humor, they should have a real
value for others besides collectors.
“Nalth”: The young pressman was taking his girl
out for the evening. On their way towards the
surf the tram passed a suburban block of shops
merrily afire. Getting down they stood on the
edge of the crowd while the reporter congratulated
himself that he did not have to “do” the darned
thing. The girl’s grip tightened on his arm and
her body stiffened with emotion. Some deep thought
seemed to be struggling for utterance. “What's gone
wrong with the works, old thing?” asked her
lover anxiously. Her brow fluttered painfully. “A
fire is a grand but an awful spectacle.” came in a
whisper from her lips. The pressman uttered a
groan and flung himself into the blazing furnace.
Gilbert Parker, who found his literary legs in
Australia, to a Maorilander who had written some-
thing of his career, says: “You have the hang of
my literary life in an exceptionally accurate way,
but why you omitted to say that I wrote three plays
for George Rignold. at Her Majesty’s Theatre in
Sydney', I cannot understand, except that perhaps you
had forgotten that side of my very varied and hard
working career. I have never gone back to Australia,
and, to be quite frank, I do not want to go back,
because some of the most important and happiest
hours of my life were spent there. I should find
old friends had disappeared and old scenes changed,
and that hurts the sensitive mind. So it is not
likely I shall ever see those wonderful shores again
where I really began to live my literary life.”
“Coot”: The Vic. schoolboy’s paraphrase of the
stanza from Tennyson’s “Brook” (B. 25/12/’24) re-
calls the other enterprising youth who was reciting
“The Ancient Mariner” and stuck at the fourth line
of the stanza:—
“All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand”....
He could remember nothing of the last line except
that it ended with “moon” and after a moment’s
hesitation improvised desperately:—
“So did the bloody moon!”
Professor John Adams tells the story in one of his
lighter moods.
“Tickets Please”: J. Higgins, M.L.C. (of N.S.W.),
lately sitting in the A.W.U. conference, has been a
pioneer of comic journalism in Australia. His first
venture was the first numbei of which co*
incided with the arrival of the American Fleet
16 years ago. The prize jest of its unfinancial
proprietary was to point to *a solitary benefactor
who paid‘a year’s subscription as “our subscriber.
The street sales were good, but advertisers failed to
arrive, and the death notice was published in the
third number. The Kookaburra was another 'en-
ture • it lasted three years and finished square with
everybody. Higgins has had other adventures as a
newspaper pioneer, having been editor of the Labor
News amongst other things ;it w 7 as in that capacity
he was appointed M.L.C. Through all his journalistic
and other vicissitudes he has remained a member
of tbe A.W.U.
THE NEW DISEASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Such deadly symptoms have appeared
I feel I must be ill
With some obscure disease too weird
To yield to any pill.
An awful everlasting crop
Keeps sprouting in my brain;
I struggle but I cr.nnot stop,
Resistance is in vain.
The very moment that I rise
The trouble starts anew
With queries such as “Why tie ties?”
And “Does your suit suit yout”
“Straps for the strapping” comes to light
As through the seething jambs
My dauntless way aboard I fight,
Commenting “Train for trams.”
The cafe table that 1 use
At once suggests to me
Such little gems as “Choose yo- chews”
And “Sip soup silently.”
And thus it is; where’er I go
Each instant brings a phrase
In wild, unreasonable flow
That no endeavor stays.
I’m neither feverish nor faint
Nor troubled with neuritis,
But smitten with that worse complaint—
Pernicious sloganitis.
VICTORIA.

HARDY’S WINES OF TINTARA
CAPT. JOHN MACARTHUR was one of the earliest pioneers of the Colony of New South Wales, and during the regime of Governor
Phillip established a small flock of merino sheep at Parramatta.
From this small beginning the production of wool has reached its present amazing proportions, and at the present time it is clearly
proved to be the strongest asset Australia possesses. *
The establishment of Hardy’s vineyards in 1853 places them among the earliest, and Champion Reserve Port is the quintessence o$
quality resulting from these years of experience and maturity.

Amy Castles opened her brief farewell
concert season brilliantly at Sydney Town
Hall on Saturday. Her choice of numbers
was marked by vivid contrasts. There were
the pleading “Eili Eili” (“Jewish Lament’),
the dramatic Octopus Song from “Iris”
(Mascagni) and “Star of the North”
(Meyerbeer), the last a contest chiefly be-
tween two flutes and a victorious soprano
> nice in a series of melodious but appallingly
difficult runs and trills. Lots of flowers and
much enthusiasm produced further variety
by the addition of some dainty trifles. Sister
Eileen, a most attractive little lady, sang
with strikingly flexible voice, though better in
the upper than the lower register, her items
including Micaela’s Song (“Carmen”) and a
Bolero by Verdi; but the audience liked her
best in the haunting air of “Danny Boy,”
sung wid just a touch of the brogue. A. C.
Bartleman, a baritone of good voice and
the intelligence to use it effectively, added
a passable “Toreador” and “Eri tu,” and the
popular Cappolli furnished “O Parndiso” and
tlu‘ Lohengrin “Narration.” the latter
rather a lightweight. Duets and quar-
tettes from “Rigoletto” and “La Boh&me”
further demonstrated the quality of this
capital concert company. Further concerts
are announced for to-night and Saturday.

“Wildflower” ran into three figures at

Unlike Hobbs and Sutcliffe, the musical

“THE MIDNIGHT
FROLICS,” AT
MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Dorothy White and Clem Dawe—inciden-
tally, they arc sister and brother.
Judging by the pile of headgear that
Moran and Wiser use in their hat-spinning
and juggling turn at Sydney Tivoli, they have
been systematically raiding the liatracks of
barber shops for years. Hats float around
the upper regions of the theatre and then
descend into the dark, mysterious bowels of
the stalls, yet always return with an un-
canny precision to the heads of the throwers
before some ambitious member of the audi-
ence can collar them and take them home to
wear about the garden. Mr. Mares notwith-
standing. the Six Brown Brothers are assur-
ing everybody per medium of the saxophone
that “It Ain’t Going to Rain Any More.”
Sydney finds them entertaining, but their
confidence about the weather is not welcomed
by the heads of the Water Board.
Sydney Fullers are saying good-bye to Phil
Smith this week, the breezy little, comedian
and his revue co. having received a call to
come over and help Adelaide. “Autumn
Love,” their final offering, was full of ginger.
Jock Mills, who reveals bare knees and a
bagpipe, is giving publicity to typical
Gaelic nonsense which capers around the
frugality of the Scot. The Flying Lloyds are
tracing hieroglyphics in the ether with their
supple bodies, Danny D’Alma’s trio of
hounds perform their tricks with a minimum
of barks, and Maud Courtney and Mr. C. set
topical happenings to dubious rhymes and
indifferent music.
Viola Dana is first seen in “Open All
Night,” at Sydney Strand, in the act of
washing her back in her bath. A little later
she attaches herself to a six-days’ cycle-i’ace
champion in preference to her mild-mannered
husband: and it is not until the beauty of the
bike-rider’s face is spoilt by the other gentle-
man that she returns to domestic placidity
and presumably further ablutions. Hoyt’s
is the rendezvous of “The Oppressed,” the
downtrodden in this instance being the
Nederlanders in the days when they were feel-
ing the Spanish Inquisition. Raquel Meller,
a French stage celebrity, illustrates herein
the superiority of the Continental artist over
the Hollywood variety. “Southern Love.”
at the Empress, is merely an excuse for
Betty Blythe to wear fewer clothes. In one
scene she is more undressed than a Bondi-
surf-girl; but, then a gypsy maiden who
rises to be the foremost toe-tripper
in Spain can’t be bothered with many encum-
brances. The now matured Richard Bar-
thelmess has outgrown his boyishness, and
the role of the cadet in “Classmates.” at the
Ilaymarket, doesn’t fit him; furthermore,
the centre of interest is shifted too often to
allow the picture to command attention.
:!«
“The Mystery of a Hansom Cab” is com-
pleting its first three weeks’ run in Sydney
and Melbourne. Arthur Shirley’s film ver-
sion of the old shocker is not a great pic-
ture, but, taking the book in his right hand,
this Showman swears that it is streets ahead
of scores of Hollywood photo-plays he has
seen. The photography is excellent (inci-
dentally, Australia is abundantly supplied
with clever young cameramen), and there
are numerous striking scenes, while—allow-
ing fqr a little stiffness here and an excess of
melodrama there —the acting is quite good
on the whole. Shirley, of course, is an
experienced film-mime, and Grace Glover
has a nice, easy style, while Stavely is a
convincing sleuth, Morton an interesting
manslayer and Isa Millett as compelling a
virago as the one in Griffith’s “Daughters of
the Storm.” Some of the minor characters,
notably Sidney Stirling, film uncommonly
well. There are the makings of a first-class
actor in Stirling; it is a pleasure to look on
his fine mobile countenance after being bored
by the wooden faces of Hollywood’s Jack
I’ickfords and Jack Holts. The sub-
Vtling is amateurish, and in the modernising
of a story first published in 18S7 incon-
gruities were inevitable. . Nevertheless, ofie
comes away with the impression that if local
producers get a fair deal in the matter of
import duties and give us clean Australian
stories with plenty of sunlight, fine scenery
and attractive types, Australian pictures
will before very long constitute from 50
to 75 p.e. of the programmes in our cinema
theatres and find a profitable world-market
as well.
* * * *
Though slight of plot. “So This Is Lon-
don !” nevertheless produced sufficient hila-
rity at Melbourne Royal to suggest that it
can live without the dances and frills usually
associated with similar trifles. When Hiram
Draper, having otherwise no use for Eng-
land, flits across the herring-poinl yvith his
family to buy a boot-factory, a shipboard
love-affair between his son (known to his
friends as “Junior”) and a pretty English
girl, Elinor Beauchamp, paves the way for
an alliance between America and England.
At first the families of both youngsters are
overcome with anguish at the prospect of
it. After his worst pre-conceptions about
the English have been confirmed by an en-
counter with a flunkey at the London Ritz
(Carlton Stuart), Hiram Draper paints a
grotesque picture of the English family into
which his son proposes to marry. The de-
vice of a black-out, followed by the entrance
of the actual people made up to represent
tlu American’s quaint conception of them,
is used to paint the verbal picture amus-
ingly. A similar device is utilised later to
allow Sir Percy Beauchamp, who groans at
tlie thought that he has lived long enough
to see his daughter desiring to marry an
American, to give his picture of the Ameri-
cans and their manners. Of course, a better
understanding is established in the last act,
Hint being what last act; are for: the two
families, brought together, find that each is
not a bit like what the other thought. And,
anyway, they have a boot-factory in common
—the boot-factory which Hiram Draper wants
to buy, and which Sir Percy Beauchamp
actually owns. It is. in fact, his realisa-
tion that the man he despised has been encr-
getic enough to run a business for the manu-
facture and sale of boots that decides Hiram
there is some good in England, after all.
* * * *
The acting generally was good, with Thur-
ston Hall well suited as a breezy and ami-
able American captain of industry; but if
his disregard for the English w T as as deep
as lie alleged, he was hardly as upset as he
might have been over his son’s infatuation.
Reginald Carrington might have made a
greater distinction between the Sir Percy
Beauchamp of Hiram's imagination and the
man who owned the boot-factory, but drew
the character in a way that harvested large
saclisful of the laughter of an evening that
was full of it. Beatrice Day was welcomed
on her reappearance as Lady Beauchamp,
"THE RISE OF ROSIE O'REILLY ,” AT
SYDNEY GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
Steve, a Brooklyn tough (Eddie Russell),
and Morgan, the good, young man of

which part she is filling during a temporary
absence of Joan Crossley with the Bouci-
cault-Vanbrugh co.; Gladys Webster was
Mrs. Iliram Draper; and Ailsa Grahame
an agreeable Lady Amy Ducksworth —the
lady responsible for bringing England and
America together. Mary Macgregor, the
bright Brisbane repertory girl, was Elinor —
she fits nicely into such characters —and
Leslie Barrie a not at all inspiring lover.
Dion Boucicault, although playing Hilary
Jesson with an intensity which gripped his
audience, was hardly as artistic in “His
House in Order,” revived last Thursday at
Melbourne King’s, as he has been in the
other shows given by his company. He
introduced too much of the conventional
business of the temperamentally strong man
—his voice was full of tears as he contem-
plated the troubles in his brother’s Victorian-
age household, and he was kept busy flinging
dewdrops from his eyes. Irene Vanbrugh
also brought forth tears rather before her
time. She was inclined to weep in the first
act instead of bearing her sorrows with hoy-
denish defiance. These comedies of the
afllictions of Victorian times are, as a matter
of fact, rather abstruse in present days; and
some of the players failed altogether to grasp
the spirit of the age in which they were
supposed to live. Mrs. Brough (Lady
liidgely) had the right atmosphere, and small
errors of forgetfulness towards the end can
be forgiven. Actually, however, the over-
stressing of emotions was all to the good so
far as the first-night audience was concerned,
and the principals, especially in the preachy
third act, which might easily be tiresome,
gripped its attention. The performance was
unusually fortunate in Terence Sullivan, a
boy who manages well in the risky part of
Derek Jesson ; and a special word is due to
Joan Crossley. who presented a coldly mathe-
matical Geraldine Ridgely. C. M. Hallard
was an old-fashioned 1025 husband instead of
a normal 1900 husband, but nevertheless did
good work.
The burning of the Town Hall has thrown
Melbourne into perplexity about a venue
for big concerts, the Exhibition Hall being
rather large, barn-like and out of the way.
The Philharmonic has seen in the catastrophe
a chance for building a hall of its own, and
there have been other propositions; but the
Firm has got out of its difficulties by decid-
ing that the Galli-Curci concerts shall take
place at the centrally-situated Auditorium,
hitherto a picture-house, which, until the
city fathers replace the Town Hall, will be
available also for other concerts.
Cappy Ricks, at the Athenaeum, . con-
tinues to give his daughter to the meaty
young hero who is able to beat him for
large sums of money. The show appears
to be worth almost as many dollars to the
management as are mentioned so lightly dur-
ing the course of the play.
At His Majesty’s. Melbourne, “Betty”
dances on her glad way to a last-act happi-
ness which wins the entire approval of audi-
ences that leave few seats wacant,
“Cinderella” held court last Saturday, at
the New Princess’s, to celebrate the fact
that 112 performances had been given at
the rate of two a day. The show has now
dropped the daily matinees, but it looks as
though many more performances will yet be
added to the Melbourne tally.
The New Palace will cease to harbor
“Midnight Frolics” at the end of next week.
A newcomer to the show, Alec Regan, has
made a good impression.
Magic and mystery came to Melbourne
Tivoli last night with the reappearance of
Fong Tack Sam and his appurtenances.
Pending this ariival Hell’s Bells Jazz Band,
Felovis and the Versatile Three have been
providing a very good bill.

In “Broadway Gold” Melbourne Majestic
is giving its patrons visions of Noo Yark's
Great White Way, with Elaine Hammerstein
as a chorus girl in search of fortune. T-he
w..ys of those European noblemen who, in
spite of the fapt that their titles are six-
pence a dozen, pianage to find a cash value
for them in alliances with American heir-
esses, are given an exposition in “Daughters
of the Rich,” the supporting bill. “Iv——,
the Unknown,” gives Percy Marmont an
opportunity to be a mystery man whose dis-
like for woman and society is overcome by
Virginia Valli. With this bill Hoyt’s de
Luxe shows Pola Negri in “Lilv of the
Dust.”
A New Gallery show :
Gladys Owen has painted with a confident hand
the 70 water-colors which now decorate the walls
of the New Gallery; and only in one or two eases is
her confidence misplaced. This is the lady’s first
Melbourne show, il l though her pic tures have been
blended into other exhibitions, and it is an impressive
one. She has a rather cheap way of scattering
blues and purples; otherwise, untied by any color
prejudices, she paints her scenes with fidelity
tinctured with imagination—sometimes more than
tinctured. “The Brisbane River” (No 51) is a
very effective bit of work; but of the Queensland
impressions, “Hamilton Reach” (No. 01) strikes
this onlooker as the best. “From Prospect Hill”
(N.S.W.) gives a real expression of distance, but
“Morning Mists” is unnecessarily misty, even for
the subject. In an endeavor to achieve the stark'
reality of color in the sunlight, Miss Owen occasionally
strikes crudeness, and the drawing in a couple of the
exhibits is faulty; but in the main the show is
characterised by the independence of a competent
craftsman who is above the necessity for pot-boiling.
“BETTY,” AT MEL-
BOURNE MAJESTY'S
Maud Fane as Betty. Alf Frith as Lord
Darcy Playne has a few words with a
parrot.
Allan Wilkie is doing well at the Prince
of Wales in Adelaide. His Malvolio and
Bottom have lost none of their rich humor,
and Miss Hunter-Watts-scores in the heroine
parts. Quick changes are being made from
the old familiar favorites to “Cymbeline” and
“A Winter’s Tale.” At the Royal a satisfy-
ing rendering of “The Christian” —with the
original ending much modified —is making
way for “The Squatter’s Daughter” which
General Desire is understood to have called
for. Australian, too, is the picture of
“Fisher’s Ghost” at West’s, introducing the
aged story of the unsubstantial bloke on a
fence; “Fires of Fate,” at the same house,
takes liberties with Conan Doyle’s Korosko
story.

“Charlik”: The last time I met Amy
Castles was some eight years ago in Mary-
borough (Q.). In appearance and manner
she was the same bonny lass I had known
before she left for Europe so many years
ago. She lias travelled far since then, and
lias completely justified all the hopes which
were expressed for her. And she will go
farther yet. Operatic singers seem to have
learned the secret of eternal youth. That
Amy was not included in the recent grand
opera co. caused much comment at the tunc,
but those who know the business were not
surprised. Maturity and experience had con-
firmed her right to the title of Australia s
prima donna, but she never asserted her
claim. She wouldn’t ; she is not built that
way. After the present tour Amy goes to
Europe and sister Eileen to New York;
George, the brother, will resume his part-
nership with that fine harpist Torzillo.
“L.H.P.” : Mrs. Brough and Maggie Moore,
who are to figure in “Trelawny of the Wells,”
at Sydney Criterion, last appeared together in
Sydney ’in 1892 at the same theatre in
Pinero’s “The Times.” Mrs. Brough played
the lead, and Maggie had the part of an
Irish landlady. Boucicault, Cecil Ward,
Brough, Frank Cates, Emma Bronton and
Emma Temple were in the cast.
“C. Ockney”: The pap-merchant, as Ran-
dolph Bedford styles James M. Barrie, is
still supplying the goods in London. Three
of the braw baronet's plays were in the bills
there when the last mail left —“Peter Pan,”
BLESSED IMMUNITY.
“Did you know that that chap who played
the violin last night was stone-deaf ?”
“He urns lucky, wasn't he?"
at the Adelphi; “A Kiss for Cinderella,” at
the Haymarket; and “The Kittle Minister,”
at the Regent. These aged pieces (the first-
named is in its 21st year, the second has
turned 10, and the other is 27) are evidently
still strong attractions. Verb. sap.
“Pollio” : Who is Reginald Goode? There
may be other answers, but this is the correct
one. Reginald is an Australian who had
the brilliant idea of “featuring” Florence
Reed as a faithful wife. Florence prides her-
self on having played more courtesans than
any other American actress. An ordinary
dramatist would as soon have thought of
writing a George Gee part for Guy Bates
Post; but Reginald Goode took it in his
stride. In order to make the faithful wife
sufficiently emotional for Florence, he has
had to include a scene in which she horse-
whips her sister —“one of the most powerful
pieces of stage-writing I have ever encoun-
tered” says Miss Reed, but the sister's
views are not given. Why hasn’t one of our
Repertory societies produced R. Goode yet?
“T.P.”: Louise Mack is scoring heavily
in Victoria with a moving picture entertain-
ment descriptive of her travels. The little
lady’s interludes are apt and comprehensive
without being prolix; and outside the opera-
tor's box she runs the whole show. Director
Tate said a word to the schools in her favor,
and it is a benediction to see a thousand
kiddies, with attendant mothers, being trailed
around the world by an ATistralian Vho
knows it. If the nippers become restless
amidst Italian or Swiss scenery, they are
invited to yell “Blowing Bubbles" or “Abe,
My Boy,” with Louise as leading vocalist,
and soon feel better. Her concluding half-
hour of Australian land- and sea-scapes shows
how favorably our scenery compares with
Europe’s; and the show has choice bits from
Bulletin poets as screen explanations, in-
stead of the usual Yankee sob-stuff. When
“resting” between towns the authoress is
licking into shape her next book —“Aus-
tralia Revisited.”
“F.T.K,”: Pity Hugh Ward cannot be
persuaded to appear again. Too many of
the younger generation look upon him only
in his managerial capacity, and are bliss-
fully ienorant of his ability to create laugh-
ter. His eccentric dancing in “Florodora”
and “The Casino Girl” and his. brilliant
comedy in “The Man from Mexico” will
never be forgotten by one playgoer at least.
It was at “The Man from Mexico” that I
saw Premier Dick Seddon for the' last time.
If Digger Dick’s portly frame did not quite
fill the box he occupied, his continuous and
stentorian laugh certainly penetrated to
every corner of the theatre.
“A.II.II.”: That Red Page reference to
Sarah Bernhardt and the lover who pre-
sented her with a coffin recalls a told
of two music-hall men, engaged on the Fuller
circuit when the Fuller firm was in a very
small way. One of them read aloud a news-
paper item relative to Sarah’s fad of taking
the coffin with her on her travels. “Cripes!”
exclaimed the other, “that’ll cost John Fuller
a bit when he books the tart’s act.”
“J.P.K.”: Quaint old Sam Gilmer of
Wellington (M.L.) always found room for
Allen Doone at the Royal Oak Hotel. But
a well-known actor who arrived from Sydney
complete with wife, children and nursemaid
had a chilly experience. He demanded a
suite, and then bedrooms with bathrooms at-
tached, neither being available. “I thought
I was coming to a first-class hotel,” said the
actor, as old Gilmer, hearing the commo-
tion, tottered up. “You’re wrong, me lad,”
said Sam. “¥ou ? re just going out of one.
Teddy, take the gentleman’s bags outside.”
“The Deacon”: Though Sam Gilmer, of
the Royal Oak, Wellington (M.L.), would
ordinarily not have pros, on his premises,
there was one actress whom he actually in-
vited to stay there. Florence Baines, the
Lancashire Lass, was taking a pretty lurid
show called “Miss Lancashire, Limited,”
through Maoriland, and she quite won over
the old man. The show made a fortune
on its trip round the world, and Florence
put a bit of her money into Westralian land,
but a second tour was disastrous, and Flo
went on the ’Alls. There Mclntosh saw
her, and secured her for an Australian
season, which was only moderately success-
ful. Once Mac fined her a week’s salary
(£120) for missing a performance. . Flor-
ence, who always had a dread of dying of
cancer, went out during the ’flu epidemic
in 1919.
“Philm Up”: “A.H.ET.” (B. 19/2/’25)
protests too much. A true picture of Aus-
tralian life would stand much more chance
in the world-market than a hashed-up version
of an English story with a title like
“Painted Daughters,” and having for its prin-
cipal scene a swimming pool with “a bevy
of bathing beauties” (Oh, those bathing
beauties!), the whole directed by a gentle-
man imported from England via Los Angeles.
TLj world-market is fed up with such stuff,
and there is abundant evidence that it looks
to this part of the world to bring it some-
thing new.
“Caesar's Ghost”: There is a re-union of
old friends in the Melbourne performance of
“So This Is London,” in which Beatrice Day
makes her first re-appearance since the war.
Herbert Leigh, who is also with the eo., was
running a co. of his own in S’Africa during
the Boer business: and in a performance of
“East Lynne,” staged in Bloemfontein,
Beatrice Day was Lady Isabel, while Leigh
himself was Archibald Carlyle. Two other
mummers well known to Australians were
also in the cast —Herbert Flemming as Lord
Mt. Severn and Reg Wykeham as Sir Fran-
cis Levison.
“Lud”: Quite an interesting event should
be the first Australian production of the new
Muriel Starr vehicle in Brisbane. The piece
—one of the most recent London hits —is
“The Pelican.” which, in spite of its ornitho-
logical title, is a gripping play of real men
and women. The authors are Mr. and Mrs.
H. M. Harwood, the latter better known as
F. Tennyson Jesse, whose comedy “Quaran-
tine” was done here by Lawrence Grossmith.
She is a family connection of the late
Laureate. Her husband is an extraordi-
narily versatile man who has studied law
and graduated in medicine, and before tak-
ing to theatrical management was chairman
of the co. that runs the family cotton-spin-
ning mills.
“Hamfat” : On one of his excursions into
the Bush, Raymond Longford, Australia’s most
consistent movie-camera man, struck a pub
which, both inside and out, was ideal for his
purposes. Hanging thirstily about were
half a dozen beer-sparrers, to whom ho sub-
mitted a proposition which made their
mouths water. All he wanted them to do
was to breast the bar and drink at his ex-
pense. There was a blackguard rush for the
bar. But just then a thought smote the
leader. He paused and turned to Long-
ford. while the others gathered round. ‘ ’Ow
much are yer goin’ ter pay us for doin’ it !
lie demanded.
OVERWORKED.
MISS WHITE: "What's the matter with Dauber? He's not looking
at all himself lately.”
MR. BLACK: “No, he's painted a self-portrait and is trying to
look like it.”
“Abbot P.”: Exit from Melbourne the
Lyric Orchestra, founded by Charles Levy in
1594. During its career of 30 _ years the
organisation played a big range of music and,
in conjunction with a chorus, staged plat-
form performances of Mozart’s “Magic
Flute” and other operas which seldom get
a hearing. Conductor Levy found his age—
lie is in the ’mid-sixties —beginning to tell,
and decided to retire. He had a great
memory, and was as familiar with Beethoven
as with the Financial Times. His library
of music was, and I suppose still is, the finest
private collection in Australia: Marshall
Hall and others often had to rely on him for
a loan of scores for their concerts.
“Charlik”: Bose Hersee (B. 19/2/’25)
had a daughter at the London Savov in the
early ’nineties. Her name was Florence
Easton. Like her mother in appearance—
a little taller, perhaps, but plump and pleas-
ing—Florfie had a good soprano voice and
was useful as understudy for Lucilo Hill in
“Haddon Hall.” Lucile was a beautiful
woman and a brilliant artiste, but so “tem-
peramental” that she could never be relied
upon to finish a performance. She would
play the first act, and then, because of some
real or fancied trouble with the management,
decline to carry on. I have seen her lie on
the stage and kick. But Florrie Easton was
always ready. Dresses had been made for
her. and she put ’em on at every perform-
ance, so that at whatever portion Lucile
skidded, the opera was never held up. That
understudy business was not of much use,
excepting for experience, to any one who
wanted to get on. It stood in the way of
promotion. There were, as a rule, five com-
panies on the road in connection with the
Savoy, but the claims of competent under-
studies for principal parts were the last to
be considered. They were too useful at head-
quarters. A contralto who had been a splen-
did understudy for Rosina Brandram for
years received a salary of 355. per week.
There is a Florence Easton at the top of the
tree in the U.S.A. now; I fancy she must be
the Savoy Florrie’s daughter, and therefore
Rose Hersee’s grandchild. Perhaps some
Poverty Pointer knows?
“F.N.W.”: In my time the chucker-out
at the average East End (London) music-
hall was a gent, with a broken nose and at
least one cauliflower ear, who, in more lucra-
tive days, had perhaps been the Poplar Pet.
It was the kind of job tvhere the imputation
of being a man-eater frequently came in
handy. Some of the old pugs, could eject
a god down a spiral staircase, in the manner
of a googly bowler, with such skill that the
kerbstone was the first thing that met the
rowdy person’s ear. Few rose past the cus-
tody of lawnorder in the gallery, however.
An exception is Gunner Moir, who manages
the somewhat shorn fortunes of the old Can-
terbury. The Gunner’s burly form com-
mands silence even on the roughest of nights.
He visited Australia with Hackenschmidt
somewhere about 1908, and while in Sydney
slugged out Petah Felix, now also on the
fringe of the profession—he was a Nubian
or something in one of Asehe’s P. and O.
plays.
“Hamfat”: Heart-
burning was caused
in one of the
J.C.W. shows by
the loud hosannas
of a member of the
co. who was left
out of a new cast
and had the pros-
pect of walking
about, on full
salary, while his
colleagues toiled.
The jubilance didn’t
last long; arriving
at the theatre one
day, the mummer
was handed a part,
which, ho was told,
had boon written
into the script. He
had to impersonate
an idiotic detec-
tive, who made a
brief appearance in
Act 1., and then
stood by for an
equally fleeting and
futile exhibition of
himself in the last
act. In vain the
sufferer stormed;
his fellow-mummers
unkindly suggested
that the incident
might teach him
not to talk so much
when he was on a
good wicket. Wait-
ing to file his pro-
test with the man
said to be respon-
sible, the indignant
“detective” cut his
asinine capers at
several rehearsals.
Then the stage-
doorkeeper was in-
structed to let him
know that the whole thing was a joke.
“S.T.S.”: Any argument about what the
“Night Out” musical foolishness is adapted
from (B. 5/2/’25.j seems odd. Almost every
critic treats it as a complete novelty. Yet
it is only musical numbers put to a play of
the same name which was really well known
in Australia 20 years ago, perhaps more.
And it is singularly little altered in the pro-
cess, much less than the earlier form was
altered from the very-French original farce.
As so often happens in these cases, the one
bit of dialogue which had stuck in the
memory is not found in the new version, ihe
too-friendly visitor to Matthew’s house had
gone so far as to remove (in the English
version) his coat. Matthew, coming home
unexpectedly, was met with the plea that
it was just a casual visit, and naturally
countered by pointing out the disrobing act.
“Dear old Matthew!” said the cuckoo in
the nest admiringly, “nothing escapes him.
“Hamfat”: Yes; it is marvellous what the
audience fails to notice. We had been billed
to play “The Fat in the Fryingpan” at a
hospitable M.L. town : but one of the prin-
cipal characters mislaid himself, and a change
to “The Body in the Butterbox” had to be
announced. A packed audience took the in-
telligence, and all that followed, very kindly,
even when a character who had been killed
in the first act resurrected himself in the
second, arjd came on to spout his best lines
from an entirely different piece. For this
innovation the generosity of citizens we had
met at the races, and who came round during
the interval with bottles and flasks, was
mainly responsible. Presently other perfor-
mers, emulous or obfuscated, or both, were
delivering the fattest lines of their parts in
other plays, regardless of cues or the con-
tinuity of the story. Matters became so
tangled that in the last act the hero was
killed, and the villain married to the heroine.
We had to raise the final curtain again and
again, and the notice I wrote for the editor
of the local paper, when he asked me next
day whether he had been to the show or
not, was the finest the co. received during
the tour.

Slender was she and young and sweet,

So swiftly she danced that it seemed to me

Those feet untiring.
Swift as a swallow, still as a dream —
Oh joy inspiring!
Child, as you sway and swing and gleam
With feet untiring
You have danced your way through the door of

Slender and young and flower-sweet,
You dance with your little, bare, brown feet

Will not stain'-'
Has a pleasant
odor —
Fly-Tox is giving the public in this and other countries
a new sense of sanitation, a new comfort, a new satis-
faction —a house without flies, ants, moths, or other insects.
Fly-Tox has given a new means of ending an old menace
of contamination, pollution, infection, and disease par-
ticularly from flies and mosquitoes.
Fly-Tox is the result of the mo£t painstaking scientific research.
It was conceived, developed and perfected by the Rex Research Fellow-
ship at the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research of the University
of Pittsburg, U.S.A., the foremost Scientific Research Institute of its
kind in the world. The Rex Companies founded their Fellowship at
the Institute so that the knowledge of the world’s leading Chemists
should be at their disposal, and no product is ever released unless it
proves superior to any article for similar purposes.
You will find Fly-Tox the ideal household insecticide, having merit
beyond all previous preparations. It is a liquid spray which quickly kills
all insects. It is non-poisonous to humans or animals. It absolutely will
not stain, and has a fragrantly refreshing odor.
Your Chemist or Grocer sells Fly-Tox in three sizes. The Hospital
Size is specially recommended for Hotels, Restaurants, Warehouses,
Schools, and Public buildings.
The specially constructed Fly-Tox Hand Sprayer is recommended.
It sprays a fine mist cloud in any position

ELECTRIC
The Motor
Is as Good as Its Maker
WHEN thinking of motors which perform their work many
miles from the source of power, one must think of Westing-
house. It was the efforts of this firm; its unfailing research and
tireless experimenting, which made possible motors for the direct
driving of machines as they are used today.
Individual motor-driven machinery makes for a saving in power;
creates finer and truer work and besides, is safer for the workman.
Small motors make possible many household comforts and too
little thought is sometimes given to the maker of them. The name
on the motor, after all, is the assurance whether the motor will fit
aptly the particular task for which it is intended.
Westinghouse builds motors of only the highest standard.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia,
Westinghouse will he pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

Keeps Face Young
If every woman knew of the
wonderful rejuvenating and
beautifying qualities of pure
Mercolized Wax, chemists
would hardly be able to supply
the demand for this remark-
able product. Just think! You
apply the wax to a faded,
withered skin, and that skin
gives way to one of youthful
loveliness, clear, soft, deli-
cately tinted as a rose petal!
The new complexion is a per-
fectly natural one, not to be
compared at all with make-up.
How Is This Accomplished?
By actually peeling off the defective
outer skin which covers up the true
skin underneath. This is a painless
process, for the thin veil of outer
skin has no nerves.. Nature renews
complexions in exactly the same way,
constantly shedding tiny particles of
the surface covering, or scarf skin.
But in time this process slows up.
Then Mercolized Wax comes to the
rescue and hastens the skin shedding.
This is the secret of its marvellous
success.
So if your skin is old-looking, sal-
low, over-red, blotchy, parched, rough
—the stubborn scarf skin—just peel
it off.
Have you Freckles,
moth patches, liver spots? Peel them
off! It’s the sensible thing t& do.
And simple. Just apply Mercolized
Wax at bedtime, as you apply cold
cream; wash it off in the morning.
Fine, almost invisible, skin particles
are flecked off with the wax. No
harm. No detention indoors. No
trace of the treatment itself is in
evidence.
The lively, young, healthy under-
skin is brought gradually to view—
and you have the exquisite com-
plexion of robust girlhood—the kind
Women Envy and Men Admire,
and you look years younger!
Obtain a package of Mercolized
Wax from your chemist or depart-
ment store, use as directed—and you
will bless the day you made the
acquaintance of this wonder-working
treatment.

Gerald D: You haven't observed anything
fresh about it. .. .R.M.A.: It may be true; but you'll
have to tell it with more circumstance to get any-
body to believe it... .W.T.G.: Put your article away,
read it in 15 years’ time, when you will probably
have become a decent Australian, and you won’t
wonder then why, in 1925 and thereabouts, the
talkative “Pommy” wasn’t always very popular in
this country... .H.C.H.: In other words, the politi-
cians having made, as you say, an awful mess of
things, a vast deal more power and responsibility
should be thrust upon them, so that the mess may
be still more colossal.... G.W.M.: A thoughtful little
contribution; but somebody beat you to the post....
A.H.: Agree with you with one reservation—first
it must be proved that we cannot get British and
other Nordic races to do the settling. So far the
second-class people haven’t done a bit more to settle
the N.T. or the Nor’-West than the British have
done, though those parts are just as much open to them
as North Queensland. This suggests that there is
something which is blocking them both; and The
Bulletin says that it is primarily the absence of the
North-South railway.... Vang: Your literary method
is too gradual for a paper where space is more preci-
ous than gold. .. .C.M.M.: Has merit; but hardly
smooth enough for that sort of thing Gerald H.:
“Interlude” already handled... .Pongo: You can’t
sharpen your little dagger on our grindstone....
K. : No use here... .Glauber: Terrible... .F.S.:
(Coburg): Not quite up, though it has promise....
Gave R.: You make it as solemn as a funeral....
James B.: Bad verse... .H.C.M.: The lines are too
rough for tired feet....L.M.11.: Perfectly respectable
stanzas that contrive to say practically nothing
M.1.R.: Not strong enough where strength was needed.
....Watmans: Don’t see the point... .Jim Domino:
Nice verse, but it doesn’t get to anything.... Frank
A.: Too long and dreary.... Ethel D.: The “Hearts”
don't thrill us J.J.S.: Misses... .Ripponlea: The
sonnet voices a majestic sorrow, like the plaint of a
primeval wheelbarrow in the sands of time:—
Ridicule mine lines again! Ido not care.
For whilst I do my best I expect th’ worst;
Yet do X fear mine brains about to burst.
I consider this discrimination re poems hardly fail-;
Narrow-minded prejudice being th’ cause, 1 dare
Say. Yet when my corpse is immers’d
Nay, almost in fact, as soon as I am hears’d
Mine works will perhaps be acknowledged somewhere!
For this reason shall I grind and grope, plod and plug
Amongst strange sombre regions fantastic,
And triumphantly come to light with gems for the
world;
For I Scorn to be classed as a big mug
Simply because I refuse to be pedantic,
And for which reason am not given a fair burl.
... . J.M.V.: As crude and obvious as a potato. That
sort of thing wants to be shaped with a delicate
edge Molly H.: Too thin and frail R.W.T. :
The wild rush of ancient jest has too little mirth....
Midas: “Clouds” are heavy with nothing. .. .Victor
R. : The constant attempts to write sonnets by people
who have not yet learned to shape a decent verse sug-
gest that the sonneteer should be made to take out
a special license... .C.F.R.: The moral tag spoils it.
.... John M.: The verse is not well enough done ; and
the brains yarn is as old as Nebuchadnezzar M.F.H.:
There is a hint in all of them ; and one is held for
a re-reading. Send us the same sort of thing, only
a lot better; and don’t write on two sides of the
paper... .Western: Doesn’t strike us hard enough.. . .
J.W.T.: Dreary screed in lamentable verse....
S. : All the commonplaces about a thunder-
storm set in a wobble-and-bump metre that suggests
a gallop of wooden horses.... Coreen N.: The only
attractive part is borrowed from Lawson.... The
Overlander: It is a gentle little thing, too delicate to
face an early death: —
A Northern drover-man was he,
And his sad story tragically,
He resolved to commemorate in verse,*
Of how his cattle they were strayed
By “Jones,” the Government’s trusty aid,
While concrete dips were slowly made,
To deal with pleuro, redwater and worse.
So he got Lawson’s poetry book
And at Paterson’s had a look.
But he reckoned everyone was a firse,
He let Willie Ogilvie go,
Took Lindsay Gordon then in tow,
After reading him he said no.
The blooming uneducated lot’s terse.
So then he started on his poem,
It was all bumps and honeycomb.
For every verse seemed jagged and rugged,
There were cattle calls in each line
Like when thunderstorms are tryin’,
And when the sun begins to shine,
As the versifier was no slugged
He wrote down verses, thirty-six,
About his woes and time for nix,
The manuscript the Postal D. lugged
To The Bulletin editor,
For he read and waged his jaw,
’Tis a grievance contagious, haw —
Blast, damn, yes the W.P.B. be juggSd.
.... .N.L. (Katoomba): The half-caste love affair
doesn’t appeal to us... .Brian O.: Not much demand
here for that sort of thing... .J.G.M.: The China-
man’s dream is du11... .Rosemary: The lamentation is
old and the verse poorly carpentered.... Label:
You must learn more about rhythm... .T.W.M.: Says
nothing but commonplaces in jolty verse and doubt-
ful grammar 39: “The Dreams” miss, but not by
many yards... .Nimshi: Not enough in it... .R.L.H.:
The sketch is thin and artificial... .W.D.F.: Too
extravagantly t01d... .M.H.H.: Doesn’t make us be-
lieve it’s true.... Tom L.: Nothing' there to get
hysterical about. .. .H.H.C.: No yarn in it Nor-
man S.: You don’t get the humor out of it. Try
again... .Burrundie: Pretty, but gets nowhere....
Rex: The ideas are thin and the verse lumpy....
L. :No point... .S.D.C.: As poor as a millionaire
tries to think he is when he sits down to make up
his income-tax return... .Kyle: Tedious and without
grip.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
1.G.C.: London Punch joke. Landed here three
years ago. Still raw. And the drawing’s awful
R.L.H.: Not bad. Doesn’t lend itself to illustra-
tion, though... .W.E.M.: We have heard of
brainless artists and aimless artists and arm-
less artists. Now we have found the art-
less artist... .J.D.: Those two eternal feminines
and their immortal joke have been dug up so often
that they are getting untidy about the ribs. Why
don’t you try something ephemeral and fleeting like
an argument between a mosquito and a duststorm?
. ...M.M: Whispers in charcoal.... Still, you seem
to be trying to say something, and there is hope
for you. .. .K.W.M.: No style about them....
J.T.P.: Your sympathies are sound, but your art
has cardiac murmurs... .Anonymous: Bas-relief of
bush parson, with teeth like a dromedary, saying
nothing to a tramp with a hand like a bunch of
adenoids can’t be returned for elucidation because it
hasn’t any name or address. Don’t know that
elucidation would help it, anyhow.

The Story of a Holiday
in NEW ZEALAND...
A different holiday—a simply great holiday, and (you must believe this!) a
holiday absolutely without worry for you!
Hundreds of miles of thrilling South Island scenery, viewed from the luxury
of big "cushiony” White Star limousines, and packed, for your special irresist-
ible temptation into a neat little 100-page "pocket edition.” You’d hate to
miss it!
It is not a mere time-table—it is a
well-written, absorbing book—get it!
Mountain, lake and river, glacier and magnificent bush—"just scenery,” but
I! And that’s just where you must have this book, for it’s a thrilling story of
Nature’s most prodigal, spendthrift mood and can’t be told in a 6in. x Bin.

Business, Robbery, etc.
Geo. Rich": Arthur Moriart.y lately re-
moved a jarrah-slab fence at Boyup estate,
Forest Hill (W.A.). The posts were stuck
in 73 years ago and came out in excellent
condition. A sample is displayed at the
Westralian Bank, Mt. Barker (W.A.). Pro-
bably a good deal depends on the age of the
post timber when split and the soil it is
buried in. I have seen jarrah posts put
down amongst ironstone stagger with dryrot
in a decade.
* * * #
“J.A.E.”: Alterations, additions and
amendments to the current “Australian Cus-
toms Guide” are again growing colossal. The
“Guide” was consolidated up to March, 1923,
and since that time 2000 decisions have been
given. A business man recently commis-
sioned an expert to bring the “Guide” up to
date so far as his business was concerned,
the job to be charged for by time. The cost
was £l2 12s. I have just been obliged to
procure a new one, and not having £l2 12s.
to spare have to take it out in time.
* * *
“Tee': C. A. L. Morant, of Adelaide,
speaking on behalf of the dried-fruits indus-
try to the Tariff Board, stated that Aus-
tralian timber was quite unsuitable for fruit-
cases. Such an\emphatic declaration re-
quires an emphatic denial. During the past
12 years Westralia has used practically no
other timber; and her red-tinted dump cases
are a picturesque and welcome circumstance
in the big fruit markets of London. What
has been done with jarrah can be done with
mountain-ash and messmate cut-offs and
waste edges, too often burnt; but people like
Morant would rather go on importing spruce
shooks.
* * *
“T.P.” : No wonder there is an agitation
for an extension of Victoria’s sugar-beet
acreage and the provision of modern machin-
ery ; last year Maffra factory made a profit
of £19,000 from 1900 acres of beet. Grow-
ers got £2 a ton for their roots, and still
the selling price of the product worked out at
less than that of cane-sugar. The manager
reports that, paying 355. per ton for beet,
despite an obsolete plant he could make
a profit out of sugar at 31d. per lb. retail
and the price could be reduced to 3d. with
an up-to-date plant and proper facilities for
handling.
* * * *
“C. Gull”: Few people who read of the
grabbing of cash from customers in big city
banks realise what precautions are taken to
guard against and prevent these robberies.
In addition to the uniformed employee on
duty, often one of the office staff, keeping his
hat on so as to look like a customer, is sta-
tioned in the banking chamber. But the care-
lessness of the majority remains almost in-
credible. Day after day warnings are given
-—often to the same neglectful persons—to keep
their cash covered until the minute for the
transaction with the bank arrives. The
worst offenders are amongst the office girls
who come to pay in money for their firms.
These have a habit of heaving a bundle of
notes on the counter and then allowing their
attention to stray to the shingle or shoes
of the lady from another firm. As hard to
protect is the man who, having collected
from the paying-teller, strolls towards the
door counting his notes. And the work of
. spotting” a potential thief or anyone who
is in the place for no good purpose would often
tax a trained detective. Men mostly dress so
well these days that it is hopeless to deter-
mine who is a crook among a crowd of
honest people.
<( * * » *
“.Sturt”: S.A. Railways have taken the
odd step of meeting the deadly competition
oi the motor-’bus on certain country runs
by starting buses of their own-—odd because,
howeier much the.se damage the rival users
of the road, they must deal a further blow
at raffwav returns. Suburban Glenelg traffic
will be handled with double-decker bodies, to
be built in Adelaide. Victor Harbor traffic
has already started, the public purse having
been drawn on for big imported vehicles sup-
posed to be beyond the reach of a private
caterer. The Department heartily condemns
its own trains by advertising its ’bus jour-
hours) at 10s., against 10s. 3d. or
ios 3d by rail (4 hours). It is not alto-
getnei to blame, however. Vested interests
and men long dead did the mischief Half
a century back Victor Harbor (and the Mur-
ray mouth in general) had a long horse-tram
inland to Strathalbyn. It is nowhere near
the real road to Adelaide; but when the rail-
ways came in they decided to use this track
and to link up with the Adelaide to Mel-
bourne line; and that was dragged, bv the
influence of politicians with resi-
gn Mt. Lofty, over nearly the highest
o-iil ° f 10 m?, untai £ s wh ? ch Adelaide mod-
*t y calls lulls. Posterity is reaping the
Harvest. The unpopular train goes climbing
and wandering about for 82 miles. The road
is under o 4: and a Department which still
calls itself Railways finds itself compelled to
come out as bus-owner on the roads and let
the permanent-and-reproductive” strips of
steel start to rust. The tragedy, of course
is that the debt won't rust too. ’
SIKES, JUNIOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Of 20 boys questioned by the police at Richmond
(Vic.), 14, whose ages ranged from 6 to 16, admitted
having broken into shops and factories.”
Oh, misjudged Sikes, with beetling brow and steely
Lock-prying eyes, forgive our moods censorious;
We were but uuled mortals, friend, and really
Mistook your soul for something much less glorious.
We pictured you with auger and with jemmy
Prowling the night on quests whose mention
frightens us,
A semi-Satan or at least a demi.
Pardon, old chap; at last pure fact enlightens us.
We also thought—blind moles ! —these fresh-faced,
gummy,
Green-apple-eating income-tax remittances
Were where they should be, home with pa and
mummy,
Feeding the ehooks or playing with the kittenses.
Enough! No more when safes are posted missing
In future shall these old false scents befuddle us;
We'll turn suspicion on the babes we’re kissing,
And feel for jemmies while they stroke and
cuddle us.

“Topee”: Having spent my youth on a
tea-flier, I hasten to answer "Table Salt s
query as to the number of ropes in a full-
rigged ship. There are but three, viz., the
main-rope, the foot-rope and the bolt-rope.
“B.” : Adelaide claims a sort of a record.
An electric generator consigned to the local
Electric Supply Co. for its new power-house
at Osborne was recently landed at the Outer
Harbor by the Asphalion, a Blue Funnel
freighter. It weighed 51 tons, and that is
said to be the heaviest weight lifted in the
Commonwealth by a ship s own gear.

of Victoria. During a visit to the Speck
recently he was admitted to the Tasmanian
Bar, but, in spite of his seniority in Mel-
bourne, ranked as its most junior member.
The other day he went oyer to conduct Ins
first case before the Tassie Supreme Court,
and directly he landed was admitted to silk,
as a matter of courtesy.
Passed out in Brisbane, at SO, .Tames
Ryan, who locked in Queensland s notable
criminals for 50 years. Joining the service
in 1865, he was appointed turnkey at Bris-
bane Gaol. Subsequently the State’s lodgers
rt Roma, Mackay and Stewart's Creek,
Townsville, welcomed him ; and in 1804 he
was appointed superintendent of St. Helena.
He held this top job in the service till he
retired in 1915.
Another Western link with Australia’s
pioneering history was broken when historic
Brindley Park station, Merriwa (N.S.M.),
went under the hammer the other day. The
original Brindley, tiring of the harness-cask
and weevily biscuits of the windjammer days,
took up the estate in 1824, and reached it
per boot and bullock-dray. Four genera-
tions have sheltered under the homestead
roof tree. A. B. Bettington, part-owner, was
the last.
“Old Apprentice”: In reply to “Table
Salt” (B. 5/2/’25) as to the number of
ropes in a ship, some argue that there is
only one, viz., the man-rope. Others say
two, the buoy-rope and man-rope; others
again, seven—man-rope, buoy-rope, bell-rope,
bucket-rope, ridge-rope, foot-rope and back-
rope. The old idea was that there was only
one, the man-rope, but on that point you can
argue till the whale-cows come home.
When it was suggested that a wallet of
notes would form a suitable reward of long
service, Arthur Neville, retiring after 16 years
as librarian of St. Mary’s Cathedral Choir
(Sydney), instantly turned the offer down,
insisting that the pleasure he had derived was
sufficient compensation. With his frock-
coat and top-hat, Neville is a well-known
identity in club life, and apart from his
musical recreations is an expert on tax
returns. In his hands a £5OO income
dwindles to a feeble £lOO a year.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris Jacobs, of Geelong,
can give most long-married couples a start
and a beating. Their combined ages ap-
proach 190 years, and they have been mated
over 70 years. Morris founded an outfitting
business‘in Geelong when Port Phillip dis-
trict was in swaddling clothes, and Geelong
a few huts strewn along Corio Bay. The
old man, though frail, still goes to business
every fine day. His and his wife’s passion is
music: they never miss a chance to hear
grand opera.
Apart from having his safe looted a Sydney
man can suffer no greater business grief
than the loss of his Sands’ N.S.W. Direc-
tory. This fine old colleague, which has
reached the age when people are entitled to
the Commonwealth pension, continues to put
on weight, and yearly tucks between the
covers that grow wider apart a few more
thousand John Smiths and Thomas Browns
who have grown up into householders and
business owners. Its services are manifold :
with its help you can trace your favorite
tea-room waitress, or its bulk renders it a
handy barricade against bailiffs.
“Tee” : Just as the corner seemed to have
been turned and the harassed shareholder
began to sniff a little return for several years
of patience, the Calyx pottery at Subiaco
(W.A.) has been compelled to shut its doors,
dismiss its hundred or two employees and
talk seriously of dismantling and going else-
where. Orders were coming in from every
State, even as far as Cairns (Q.), when the
employees demanded shorter hours and fatter
pay-packets. It was not within the length
of the purse, so the order went forth to the
hands that they must silence the jigger and
put away the moulds. If a factory can’t
pay what the Trades Hall wants it must die.
“Macquarie Street” on a noted zoologist:
There are not many left of the late Professor Has-
well’s first zoological students; in fact, of the very
first class at Sydney Uni. only Dr. W. G. Arm-
strong, now a member of the Meat Board, and the
writer are living. The room assigned to him was
very small, and was used, too, by Professor Stephens,
who lectured in botany. There was also a diminutive
roomlet devoted to practical work: if we got stuck
with regard to the exact structure of the heart of
the crayfish Professor Ilaswell was always at hand
to give us a scholarly lesson. He was self-effacing
to a high degree, had a nervous manner, and a slow,
halting delivery; the exact opposite to that of the
Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, whose delivery
was incisive, clear and commanding. There was
no trace of nervousness about Professor T. P. Ander-
son Stuart. He had been trained amidst turbulent
students in Auld Reekie. Professor Haswell took
a fatherly interest in our zoological studies, often
giving us a holiday and taking us out in a launch.
Ball’s Head, because of deep water, was the usual
rendezvous, and there nets were cast and starfish,
cuttlefish, crayfish, ete., drawn up on deck for our
delectation. Those were good days; and if we
rather prided ourselves on our zoological knowledge
it was all because of the earnest efforts of the kind
Professor.

Mr. Compton Mackenzie—
Well-known author, fearless critic anil
Editor of “THE GRAMOPHONE”
(England),
writes in that journal as follows:
“I have been enormously impressed by my
first experience with the Edison instrument and
Edison Records. The first thing that got me
was the piano record. I have never heard any
piano record to touch it for realism. I then
tried Claudia Muzio in a couple of arias, and
I could not believe it was the same voice I had
heard attributed to her on other records. A
harp record was astonishing.’ As for jazz bands,
all the jazz bands I have heard on the gramo-
phone sound like tin kgttles by comparison. I
am pretty hard bitten in the way of gramophone
improvements, but the jazz bands of the Edison
HAVE AMAZED ME.”

Rexona Soap
Gives Natural Beauty to Skin and Hair!
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps
do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to
dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can
only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, heal-
ing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, the value of which in the
treatment of skin affections is
known throughout the
world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap
regularly once or twice a
day, and see if it does
not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples,
and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

The Jester.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
'VT'O fool had ever quipped so well
\ Nor made such laughters for the
* King;
1' fashioned smirking masks for death,
And wrung a smile from everything.
Even the prior unbent to hear
fine who could string such rosy cheer.
H, laughed in long green garden ways
Where kilted hollyhocks were swung;
He jested in the jousting ring
When knights were prone and gloves were
flung.
Till dav trailed ribbons in the east
Ho loitered at the tourney feast.
Where the blue moat lay like a dish
With silver lilies offered up
•To mocked the archers of the foe
With pebbles in a jewelled cup;
Mid when the world with snow was white
jlis chuckling lit the wintry night.
He piped of love and merriment,
Of feet that danced away the years;
He said the good God moulded him
’ Without a duct to carry tears;
jid, wittily, the rogue confest
Himself the bastard of a jest!
Horn warm, white rains of summer eves
The grass was lush and high the wheat;
r rSc pale day found 11s at our wine
In song and story indiscreet.
Till one leapt up and. hiccoughing,
.store, ere we slept, the fool must sing.
We could not find him in the hall
Nor slumbering on his pallet bed,
Ifct in the tossing orchard trees
I, at a flick of gold and red,
Tried “Tally-ho! I’ve drawn the elf!”
Who dreamed a fool would hang himself?
Tie wind that swayed him smelled of flowers ;
His cap and bells sagged o'er his eyes.
A lark sprang from beneath his feet
To thread with song the upper skies;
And there were lilies in the grass
With purple flags to see us pass.
One fell to sobbing, weak with wine;
One spilled libation for his sake;
One whimpered that he had not known
That motley had a heart to break.
T stood apart from all the rest
To ponder on his last mad jest!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Green Hills Packet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
[T was with a certain grim sense of
sceptical curiosity, blended with con-
tempt and dislike, that old Captain
Joseph Mulholland, lately of the East India
Company’s service, and now of Mabel Yale
station, out by Patrick’s Plains, found him-
s|f a passenger upon the steam-packet
Sophia Jane, on an evening of early sum-
rat in 1831, as she steamed down Port
Jackson at the beginning of her voyage to
the Hunter River.
He did not believe in “tea-kettles” that
went to sea, held that fire and water were in-
compatible elements from whose union
nothing but disaster could result, and criti-
cised every manoeuvre of the new navigation
svith sarcasm and dislike. Even the fact that
he little vessel was capable of proceeding
o the Heads against a strong flood tide and
i stiff nor’-easter was offensive to him. The
burning of the paddles and the volume of
Jack smoke that poured from the tall,
rilled funnel were disagreeable to ears and
yes. The complacent self-satisfaction of
be commander, as he paced back and for-
ward before the big wheel at the stern,
Imost annoyed him to rudeness. When that
’entleman, a retired lieutenant of the Royal
s avy, ventured to ask his opinion of the
hip, as she swung round Bradley’s Head
nto the Western Channel, he got it hot and
trong.
“Think of her, Cap’n Biddulpli? I don’t
bink of her at all. I’d as lief think of a
Jghtmare—or a busli-fire. Why, Gobless-
lesoul, it hurts' me to see a sailor-man like
curself having anything to do with such a
nitrivance. Stink, noise and danger—that’s
hat I might think of her, if I permitted my-
'f to indulge in indecent reflections upon
monstrosity. Why, hang it all, man—what
0 you think of her, Cap’n?”
The old gentleman removed his beaver
r : ’P-hat, and, using a red handkerchief, mopped
1§ brow of the perspiration induced by
m heat of his indignation. Captain Bid-
‘ph merely smiled as he answered. He
Js used to such outbursts.
‘Well, you see,” he said gently, “I saw
■r built, and brought her from England,
r.’maybe I’m a little prejudiced. Besides,
ph P ar t owner.”
•_The pioneer of steam navigation in Aus-
‘Masian waters—Captain Biddulph was that
ilk al ? n £ the white decks of his ship,
J d the polished brass-work gleaming in the
‘ J s of the setting sun did not give him
cater pleasure than the black smoke from
e thin funnel and the creaming wake that
’Odea from beneath the paddle-boxes and
fead a white carpet astern.
ii u was ve ry proud of the Sophia Jane —
- [. as Henry Ford might have been proud
ms first motor-car. It is true that he did
®ake her himself, as Mr. Ford made the
‘ J. Lizzie,” but he had been amongst the
[best of his great service to recognise the
Jfaty changes in maritime affairs that she
r .y* a symbol of. The Navy had scoffed at
j from admiral’s cabin to gun-room
lower-deck, its application to sea uses
if been a jest and a by-word—but he had
cved in it from the time when, hardly
LI? . years before > the news of Henry
; ton s voyage on the Hudson River had
across the Atlantic to England,
e could smile with the tolerance of faith
ue scorn and distrust of fine old seamen
...•me Mulholland. Not in any way did it
. his pride in the vessel he had pinned
faith in. She was only of 256 tons bur-
rj ’ aa d a length of 126 feet, a depth of six
a beam of twenty, and her 50-horse-
er engines drove her down the harbor at
a speed of about eight miles an hour: but he
knew there was no ship like her south of the
Cape of Good Hope, and that, so far as Aus-
tralasian sea-transport went, she was the
beginning of a revolution.
“Goblessmesoul, sir,” the old man grumbled
on, “look over there.” He pointed across the
shining waters to Watson’s Bay, where a big
convict transport, newly arrived, lay at
anchor, awaiting her admission papers—her
white, lialf-furled sails hanging loosely to the
yards, pink in the last of the sunlight.
‘‘Demine, Cap'n Biddulph, that’s what I call
a ship! And her but an ocean-going prison-
lmlk, in a manner o’ speakin’. Mark my
words, sir, when packets like this have burnt
and blown themselves oft' the face o’ the
waters, and are forgotten—save only as the
recollection of a temporary craziness—ships
like yonder’ll be a-sailin’ of the seas. Make
no doubt of it, sir—make no doubt of it.”
A pretty girl in a coalscuttle bonnet and
pink gingham, with an Indian shawl about
her shoulders, who stood by the pinnacle,
turned laughingly to the master of the Sophia
Jane.
“Oh, dear papa! Pray, Captain Bid-
dulph, don’t heed him, I beg of you. He
hates anything new. Why, I declare, he'd
sooner see the assigned servants up at Mabel
Vale cultivating the river Hats with hoes than
a team of bullocks doing it with a plough
behind them. Dear papa, you’re nothing but
a rank old Tory. And Toryism does not
do in Australia. All the same, I believe
lie’s been looking forward to this voyage to
the Green Hills under steam for weeks past,
Captain Biddulph.”
The old man snorted. “Tcliut, child!
That’s very good, that is. ’Twas yourself,
miss, who vowed you’d not ride over the Wol-
lombi to Patrick’s Plains any more, whilst
this snorting barge was running. No offence,
Cap’n—no offence. But I confess I don’t
like it.”
Captain Biddulph laughed outright.
“My dear Miss Mabel, I’m used to such
criticism. All I’ll say is that I’ll engage the
master of yonder transport is bewailing his
misfortune in having to drop anchor up here,
with such a fair wind. If it should fall
calm to-morrow he may stay thei’e a day, or
two or three days, before he can get up the
harbor. I’ve known a vessel lie there a week
in the winter-time—with a stiff westerly
blowing—before she could get up to Sydney
Cove. It would make no difference to the
little Sophy here. She’d be alongside the
wharf in half an hour from Shark Island.”
Presently a negro steward came on deck
and rang a dinner-bell, and they went down
to supper in the little cuddy aft, where Cap-
tain Mulholland found the first virtue that
he was destined to find in the Sophia Jane
to lie in an excellent curry. He did not know
that this was a piece of strategy on the part
of her master and part-owner, who had a bet
with one of the other owners that he would
convert his passenger to some small admis-
sion, at least, of the good points of the
Sophy.
All night they puffed and churned along
that beautiful sixty miles of coastline,
which, of course, was only visible dimly
against the western stars —further out to
sea than the Hunter River steamers go now,
because- there were only two lights upon the
coast of N. S. Wales ninety-three years ago.
The Macquarie Light stood where it does to-
day, in the fine tower designed by Mr.
Greenway that did duty from 1816 to 1880.
and on Beacon Hill, at Newcastle, two con-
victs attended all night to an immense brazier
filled with burning coals. To-night, if you
keep the Macquarie Light open with the red
lantern on Barrenjoey. at the mouth of
Broken Bay, you will clear Long Reef. On
those distant nights the dangerous spit of
rock, level with the sea, had to be given a
wider berth.
* * * *
Round the Coal Island (Nobby’s) they
passed at six o’clock in the morning—the
breakwater joining it to the mainland, which
had been started by Major Morrissett and
the cat-o’-nine-tails half a dozen years before,
was not completed for long after this —and
were in the Hunter. They passed by the
mean-looking little village of Newcastle,
swung round to the broad reach to star-
board, and entered the main channel of the
river. For a few miles they navigated be-
tween the mud flats and mangroves, and then
came into the low-lying timbered country,
where flocks of white cockatoos flitted across
the shining waters, and parrakeets of many
colors chirped and chirruped in the dense foli-
age lining either bank. The Green Hills —
whose pretty name was afterwards foolishly
changed to Morpeth—lie 35 miles from the
mouth of the Hunter, at the head of naviga-
tion, and in those days, and for a generation
afterwards, were the port of the Hunter Val-
ley. New England and the Liverpool Plains.
By breakfast-time they were passing
through the famous Lower Hunter flats, than
which there is no richer country in Austra-
lia, not even excepting the Upper Hawkes-
bury. “Let the reader.” wrote Dr. Lang,
“figure to himself a noble river, as wide as
the Thames in the lower part of its course,
winding slowly towards the ocean, among
forests that have never felt the stroke of the
axe, or seen any human face till lately but
that of the wandering barbarian. On either
bank the lofty gum-tree or eucalyptus shoots
up its white, naked stem to the height of
150 feet from the rich alluvial soil, while
underwood of the most luxuriant growth com-
pletely covers the ground, and numerous
wuld vines, as the flowering shrubs and para-
sitical plants of the alluvial land are indis-
criminately called by the settlers, dip their
long branches covered with white flowers into
the very waters.”
Along one of these splendid reaches the
Sophia Jane was churning her noisy course
through the hot morning, against a tide which
had just begun to ebb, when Captain Mul-
holland and his daughter came on deck and
joined Captain Biddulph at the stern, where
that gentleman conned his ship through the
intricacies of the channel.
“Well, sir,” said the latter, after cere-
moniously greeting the girl, “and, pray, may
I ask what sort of night you have spent?”
“Oh, well, sir, it might have been worse—
but it might have been better. What an in-
fernal noise that machinery makes ! And the
puffing and blowing! Goblessmesoul, you
don’t get a hideous row like that under sail.”
The captain laughed. “Well, no—perhaps
not. But, on the other hand, you’ll observe

ACCIDENTS occur when least expected
—the slip with the knife or tin-opener
—the hot oven door against your bare
arm —the kettle that boils over —the twisted
ankle on the steps —and the children’s cuts
and bruises.
An efficient and the most compact first-aid
ever known consists of a box of that ever-
ready healer, Zam-Buk.
First wash away any dirt or grit
from the wound; cover it with a
piece of tint or any bit of clean rag
on which some Zam-Buk has been
spread. Rub gently with Zam-Buk
for bruises and sprains. Keep
covered up (especially in burns
and scalds), and let Nature and
Zam-Buk do the rest.
Pain is quickly soothed by the Zam-Buk,
inflammation and swelling are allayed, and
the germs present in all wounds are pre-
vented from setting up blood-poisoning.
The growth of a new covering of healthy
skin proceeds apace, and very soon all trace
of the injury is quietly but effectively
removed.
It is important to select Zam-Buk because
it means safety first. Unlike ordinary oint-
ments, Zam-Buk is of purely herbal origin;
it contains no coarse mineral drug or rancid
animal fat to corrode the skin.
d
u
THE SAFETY-FIRST HEALER
Scientific test proves Zam-Buk to be absolutely pure, so
it may be diluted with pure olive oil or used as sold. Never
be without this “Safety First” healer; use it for obstinate skin
diseases like eczema, ulcers, poisoned wounds, ringworm, etc.,
as well as for superficial injuries.
Of Chemists and Stores everywhere at 1/6, or 3/6 family size.

that we are now running against the tide,
with not a breath of wind to shove us along.
That, at least, is a point in the Sophy’s
favor?”
“Maybe, maybe. Perhaps it is. But
what’s the hurry! Too much infernal hurry
in these days. Mabel, my child, take care!”
llis daughter had climbed upon the low
rail, and was seated facing them, behind the
wheel, amidships. She laughed at her
father's reluctance to concede any good thing
to a steamer.
“Papa, you know very well you’ve had a
splendid night! Why, I could hear you snor-
ing all night”—her speech ended in a little
scream, as she overbalanced and disappeared
over the stern.
“O my God!” bellowed the old man,
rushing to the rail.
Captain Biddulph acted promptly. He
threw a cork lifebelt into the water.
“After her, Dick!” he shouted, and a
young man, one of the crew, leaned instantly
into the water. “Keep quiet. Mulholland —
d—n you ! She’s safe enough. Her dross
won’t let her sink, and that fellow’s like a
duck in the water. Keep quiet, sir!” Then
In* proceeded to the rescue.
Lifting a voice-trumpet from the deck, he
shouted: “Ease her! Stop her!’’
A man at the engine-room skylight bel-
lowed instantly into the ship’s interior : “Ease
her! Stop her!”
“ A-starn /” yelled Biddulph.
“ ’Starn !” came the echo from amidships.
For a few moments the paddles ceased to
churn the waters, then began to revolve
slowly backwards. Down the reach behind
them, fifty yards away, they could see the
young sailor supporting the girl in the midst
of the gleaming waters. The gap widened
between them and the ship, until her way was
checked. The captain took tin 1 wheel, and
presently the Sophia Jane began to move
slowly backwards, and the distance, as she
gathered way, to decrease. The sailor and
the girl were swimming against the tide,
strongly enough to maintain their positions.
Presently—the steamer checked again by the
same human engine-room telegraph—they
were under the counter.
It is not possible to print here the things
that old Joe Mulholland had been saying.
They were partly prayer and partly impre-
cation of the best sort that old-time sailor-
men were capable of uttering. They must
be imagined.
Before long, a rope having been lowered,
and made fast beneath her shoulders, the girl
was hauled aboard, and, none the worse for
her swim, had been hugged to her father’s
burly chest, so that he was nearly as wet as
she. The young man, grinning, had swarmed
up the line. The rescue was complete.
Captain Biddulph triumphed. “Well, now.
Captain,” he said, “what do you think of the
steamer now?”
The old man shakily grasped his hand.
For a few moments his grateful words could
not find utterance. When they did. his
daughter put her fingers in her cars, and ran
below.
“May the Lord d—n and sink my soul.
Cap’n Biddulph! I’m a old lubber!
A silly old ! Goblessmesoul. sir. if this
had been one of those d—d windjammers,
she’d ha’ been drowned. Sir. steam is a
great invention, as applied to maritime pur-
poses !”
Captain Biddulph bowed, as the Sophia
Jane resumed her passage to the Green Hills.
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Confidence Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IN the very beginning Slim Brawley, the
confidence man, was at a distinct dis-
advantage. He did not know that young
Jerry Hartigan was not quite so simple as
he looked. If he had known he wouldn’t
now be languishing in one of the State’s most
uncomfortable prisons.
There was no denying the fact that Jerry
looked simple. He was a slightly-built youth
of twenty-four, with an innocuous, pale face
that simply advertised his good-nature and
honesty. By profession he was a chefs
assistant, which, no doubt, accounted for the
pastiness of his complexion. He was born
and lived in Auckland. One year Jerry
decided that Australia offered far more
chances of advancement for chefs 1 assist-
ants than Auckland; so he took a third-class
passage on a steamer to Sydney.....
Three mouths later Jerry sat on his ri'ck-
etty bed in a cheap hotel in George-street
and faced the position that he was practically
broke. His fortune amounted to precisely
five shillings and sevenpence. Australia had
proved a bitter disappointment. There
seemed to be a singular surplus of chef s'
assistants in the country. Jerry sighed, put
on his hat, and sauntered into the streets.
He took a route he had taken on successive
mornings for over a month, and presently
found himself outside an employment bureau
in Gastlereagh-street. The glass window was
covered with sheets of dirty paper advertising
situations that were vacant. Jerry spent
a quarter of an hour scanning them. Alas!
no one seemed to be lacking a chefs assist-
ant.
Jerry was just making up his mind to
enter the bureau and institute discreet in-
quiries concerning the gentleman who wanted
a gardener by the day (145.), when he
was conscious that the well-dressed man be-
side him was examining him with a flatter-
ing interest. Sure enough the stranger
addressed him.
“You’re not looking for a job, are you?”
“That I am,” said Jerry with an accent
which was hard to distinguish from that of
the “Pommy.”
“Good!” said Mr. Brawley enthusiasti-
cally. “You may be just the man I’m after.
Can you drive a Ford car?”
“That I can !” said Jerry, catching some
of his benefactor’s enthusiasm. -
“Good!” repeated Mr. Brawley. “Now
look here: my uncle has an orchard down
near Melbourne. He wrote to me the other
day saying he wanted a man to take the
fruit from the orchard in a Ford car to the
local railway station. The job is worth
£2 10s. a week and keep. Will you take it?”
It did not take Jerry long to make up his
mind. "That I will!” said he.
“Good!” said Mr. Brawley for the third
time. “You must catch to-night’s train.
Come up to the railway station and I'll get
you your ticket.”
Jerry and Mr. Brawley chatted amiably in
the tram on their way to the railway station.
Jerry thought that Mr. Brawley was one of
the most entertaining men he had ever met.
As they left the tram Mr. Brawley felt
through his pockets and produced two per-
fectly good pound notes. He ransacked his
clothes again, then turned to Jerry with
an annoyed look upon his face.
“That’s a darn nuisance now,” said Mr.
Brawley.
“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.
“l've come away with only two pounds.
Your fare is a lot more than that. I say,
can you let me have a pound? I’ll square up
with you later in the day. It seems a pity
to turn back again now.”
Jerry was quite upset over Mr. Brawley’s
forgetfulness and said that he would. It
was the least he could do for the man who
was getting him a good job. Suddenly he
remembered that he had only five shillings
and seven pence to his name.
“I’m awfully sorry,” said Jerry. “But
1 haven’t got a pound. 1 can give you five
shillings, though.”
Mr. Brawley looked hurt, and Jerry
missed the enraged snarl that curled about
his lips.
“Orlright,” said Mr. Brawley sourly, and
lapsing into coarser speech: “That’ll have
ter do, I s’pose. I know the bloke at the
winder, lie might book up the balance.”
Jerry handed Mr. Brawley his five shil-
lings. Mr. Brawley shoved the coins into
his pocket, and walked briskly away.
And then Jerry realised with a start that
Mr. Brawley was heading not for the ticket
offices, but in the direction of a subway. In
a flash he knew that he had been done in the
eye—almost.
With admirable initiative In* gave chase
to Mr. Brawley. He caught up to that
astute gentleman just as lie was returning
the bait of two pound-notes to his pocket.
Mr. Brawley was chuckling; but his merri-
ment turned to ill-concealed fury as Jerry
appeared on the scene. No doubt Mr. Braw-
ley fully intended to take to his heels and
run. But Jerry’s fist caught him in the
stomach first. So Mr. Brawley perceived
that he had to fight—which he did, praying
that he might stoush his opponent before
the police came. He didn’t. Mr. Brawley
got: it in the neck, and also elsewhere.
Presently a policeman dived down the sub-
way and parted the combatants.
"Now what’s all this about?” he roared in
righteous anger, because it was a hot day
and lie didn’t like being taken away from
the shade of a tree in Eddy-avenue.
“This bloke suddenly come at me,” ex-
plained Mr. Brawley nervously.
“lie’s a liar, constable,” cried Jerry. “He’s
a confidence man. He took some of my
money.”
The policeman, who liked being called
“constable,” looked scarchingly at Mr.
Brawley and remembered him.
“So it’s you ‘Slim,’ ” said he, feeling in
his hip pocket for a pair of handcuffs. "Fp
to your old game again'. Cripcs, you’re a bit
tough trying to do a young fellow like this,
aren’t you? How much did he take, son?”
Jerry straightened liis collar and smiled
benignly upon Mr. Brawley.
“Two pounds!” he asserted cheerfully.
“You’ll find them in his left-hand coat
pocket.”
“It's a lie! It's a lie!” shouted Mr. Braw-
ley. “I only took five shillings. I had that
two quid before I met ’im ; s'welp me Gawd
I did !”
“You see, constable,” said Jerry gravely.
“He admits having stolen money from me.
He wants putting in prison.”
"He won’t be disappointed,” said the
policeman grimly. “ ’Ere, you hand over
that two quid, Slim. Y’oughter be ashamed
of yourself pinching it from a kid like this.”
Mr. Brawley began a glorious curse that
lasted until he was brought up before a
magistrate in the morning, when he saw
Jerry place two crisp pound-notes tenderly
into his pocket and depart towards a tram
whistling that part of “Kathleen Mavour-
neen” which emphasises that “it may be for
years; and it may-a be for ev-er.” Mr.
Brawley, it appeared, did not have a sense
of humor.

Dark Hour.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Outside my window ’mid the dark
I mark a starry gleam of light;
But in my soul no vivid spark
Illumines the oppressive night;
Yet through the days your starlike eyes
’Neath twilit lids would softly shine
When silently ’neath arching skies
Your dear eyes swiftly answered mine.
Soft girl, whose every fragile grace
Gave grace of mind when mind was dim,
For on the sweet lines of your face
Was staved the holied evening hymn,
I little knew your step was set
To match the godhead’s day by day,
Yet when the eyes are dim and wet
We mark the Heaven we cast away.
You little know the life you give
In giving life to every dream—
The life we dream but cannot live,
Yet seem to live, and, living, seem
To hold, and, holding, know the power
That bides in dusky, braided hair:
Dark as the tresses of the hour
That lips the mouth of drear despair.
And yet your memory on my sense
Is like a lily and as cool;
A gracious hand that tosses hence
A message on the tranquil pool
Of thought unthinkingly; and while
Each message is a new-born pledge,
Each ripple is a warm-lipped smile,
Smiling at Grief upon the edge.
