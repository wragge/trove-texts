Malthoid is primarily a roofing material—the finest roofing material made, as
we believe. But it has other uses. It is used as a floor covering where traffic
is heavy. It is used for mats in Electrical plants. It is used on Switchboards to
keep the damp from the instruments. It is used over lining-boards for walls.
It makes magnificent walls, because it is a non-conductor. It keeps houses cool
in summer and warm in winter. It is used on farms for a score of purposes.
We’d like to send you a book on the Uses of Malthoid.

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion vei’y often become faddists as regards their food, and
find themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties
prevent abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive
ferments to act, and if taken regularly
after meals they so improve the diges-
tion that a strict diet becomes unneces-
sary. Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes
are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dys-
pepsia.

It, is to Henry Lawson that, after all, we
have to go when we want the real Australian
verse. It is the real Australian verse
because it expresses the flavor of Australia,
the essence of our life, because it possesses
the magic, intimate touch that makes a whole
continent akin. Lawson has lived his verse ;
it is merely his life that—in verses careless,
inchoate, and occasionally slovenly—he pours
interminably out. He clasps your hand —and
holds it, while he tells his tale. An artistic
and critical aloofness from his subject is
impossible to Henry Lawson. He just
yarns—and in the most natural way sidles
into personal digressions. Thus in his story
of Peter the Great, he breaks off to inform
his listeners of another ship-builder—Law-
son’s father.
And I’d like to say my father mastered navi-
gation too.
(He was born across in Norway, educated
fairly toell,
And he graftedJn a ship-yard by the Port of
Arundel.)
An interesting fact —to Lawson. Why
not mention it, even in a poem about the
Russians? Later on, we get further infor-
mation about his younger brother, casually
furnished at the end of a poem, the poet
being apparently quite unperturbed by, or
ignorant of, the fact that this unnecessary
postscript spoils the poem.
But if you take the trouble to cut out the
excrescences the rest is poetry. Lawson
has the power, often withheld from poets of
a. higher artistic calibre, of communicating
his effects to his readers. His stuff, in the
vaudeville phrase, gets over the footlights.
It is not the most poetic stuff; but it is
popular stuff, simple, intimate songs about
things that in themselves have their appeal
to us. Here and there in this collection of
verse, entitled My Army, O My Army! and
Other Songs (Tyrrell’s, Sydney, Is.). Law-
son achieves a poem, complete in itself with-
out Lawson’s casual asides. “Peddling-
Round the World,” like the other verses, has
appeared already in this paper; but only its
length precludes its re-quotation here. Law-
son’s conception of England as a gipsy lass,
always hawking her wares around the globe,
is finely picturesque, stressing an undying
truth about England now obscured by the
war. And that pregnant truth is brilliantly
expressed. The Slavonic Songs are remark-
able for Lawson’s graphic use of imagined
homely detail — ,
From the silence of Siberia, and the strange,
snow-deadened streets
“The Russian March” makes ns not only see,
but hear, the slow, tremendous oncoming of
the Slavonic hordes.
Russian mist, and cold, and darkness, on the
weary Russiati roads;
And the sound of Russian swear-words, and
the whack of Russian goads;....
There's the grind of tyres unceasing, where
the metal caps the clay;
And the “clock“clock." “dock" of axles
going, on all night and day....
Here and there the sound of cattle in the
mist and in the sleet.
And the scrambling start of horses, and the
ceaseless splosh of feet ....
And when the army halts
Sounds of boxes moved in waggons, and of
axes on a log —
And the wild and joyous baricing of the
regimental dog!
Sounds of pots and pans and buckets, and
the clinic of chain and hook —
And the blasphemous complaining of the
Universal Cook.
Of course, there must be Russian swear-
words, and Russian regimental dogs, and
Russian cooks. Lawson merely brings them
to our mind, and fixes them there. It
occurred to none of our other poets that it
would be worth while.
“A New John Bull”;
A tall, slight English gentleman,
Who hates to soil his hands:
He takes his mother's drawing-room
To the most outlandish lands;
and who was, Lawson mentions, “the only
gentleman that shamed the cad in me,” and
“Booth’s Drum” show Lawson at his best.
In between there are poems that show him
at nearly his worst. But the book has
throughout it an individuality: behind it is
a poet. Unhappily, it is only in occasional
poems that Lawson the poet, and not Lawson
the vanter-rite-and-will, shows himself. Still,
there is enough of Lawson the poet to please
the average reader.
The late J. P. Bourke (“Bluebush”) belongs
to an age long past in Australian literature.
Off the Bluebush, Verses for Australians
West and East Sydney; 3s. 6d.),
is presented by his editor to the decadent
critics of the East as a proof that “the most
virile and the most original poetry that has
been made in Australia since the Common-
wealth began” comes from Westralia. “For
vigor and versatility the East at the moment
has few writers to rival this little Western
comradeship” of “Bluebush” (J. P. Bourke),
“Dryblower,” “Crosscut,” “Prospect Good,”
and the rest. The editor admits that this
Westralian poetry is often inartistic.; it is
often a poor thing considered as literature;
but be pleads that it is written from a heart
to a heart, that it has sincerity, truth of
vision, sympathy comparable to that of the
old ballads.
Well, if we are to have the question of
East vci'sus West so truculently raised, if
there is to be forced upon ns a poetical civil
war at this inopportune moment, it seems
a pity that the book of “Bluebush” should be
flung down as the gauntlet of the
West. J. P. Bourke writes nice verses—of
the sort that were written universally
throughout Australia ten years ago—doubt-
less many of these verses were written ten
years ago; but then both East and West,
not forgetting North and South —contributed
those verses. Now, apparently, if we are
to believe “Bluebush’s” editor, it is only in
the West that this sort of verse is cultivated
—or survives. If “the East has more refined
writers, more cultivated and more artistic
writers ; but not more manly writers” why
is J. P. Bourke cited? It would be unfair
to quote thin futile riming exercises like
“Dreams,” “Till Day is Done,” “Dreaming
the Dream of Life” —mere words neatly
dovetailed, without emotion or thought. J.
P. Bourke does this sort of thing as easily
and as emptily as the writers of the decadent
East. It would be unkind, too, to quote more
than two lines of the soliloquy-rime of the
“The Diamond Wedding” sort: —
To-day is our diamond wedding, old wife!
Some seventy summers and more. ...
or the narratives of “Old Bill Bates, “Dan,
the Hatter,” “A Bloke from Mullingar,”
“Soaker Smith,” or “Hell for Leather”: you
will find that G. R. Sims sort of Outback
narrative in the files of this paper 20 years
ago. Its survival in the West is quaint, that
is all.
The sole individual note struck by “Blue-
bush” is to be found in his casual humor,
embodied in such strains as “Nearly a Pessi-
mist,” “Scratehin’ for a Crust,” and “Beer
is .Enough.”
That is the best that the West has to
proffer—at least, in this allegedly represen-
tative volume. But, in his own class, we
have merely to put Henry Lawson—and
Henry Lawson not at his best. Behind
Lawson’s latest volume stands an achieve-
ment that for bulk and quality is a Kos-
ciusko to an ant-hill.
The illustrations by Ned Wethered repre-
sent, . according to the editor’s claim, “the
promising effort of a Westralian designer
and illustrator, almost wholly self-taught,
aged 20.” They look it. It is not Ned
VVethered s fault that the decorations are
sometimes incongruously placed, but his col-
lection of fantods, illustrating a poem on
that subject, is the least interesting and
most gentlemanly mob that this page has
ever drunk. The full-page illustrations sug-
gest the possibility that the art of the West
stands to the art of the East in the same
relation as does its poetry.
"NEARLY A PESSIMIST.
What’s the use o' laughter,
What's the use o’ strife ,
To a gloomy shafter
In this team of Life?
Hear the whips a-crackin’
Through the atmosphere,
When the traces slacken —-
Let us have a beer?....
What's the use o' prayin'?
'Tain’t no use to curse;
What’s the use o' layin’
'Gainst the ivinning hearse?
Man at best’s a rotter,
Fried and frizzled here;
Hell can be no hotter —
Let us have a beer.
What's the use of sittin ’
Dry as blessed chips?
What's the use of spiitin ’
Through our corn-bcef lipsT
What's the use of drinkin’f
Well, that ain't so clear
To my way of thinkin ’ —
Let us have a beer.
What's the use of frettin'
'Cos you missed the pot?
What’s the use o' gettin'
In a tied-up knot
Bet you can't unravel
If you tried a year?
No. that cop don’t travel —-
Let us have a beer.

Homewards at my top..;.
What’s the use o’ bargin’
With a white-eyed slop?
The same calm, comfortable philosophy
is to be found in this more dignified treat-
ment of the same wet subject:—
Beer is enough. Let us he satisfied,
Nor fret our hearts with longing after gin,
And boh saloons, and vanities beside.
That lead one to the shelving edge of
sin ....
For wights who sit a-rotv along the pave,
With crackling skins, and drooping lives to
save,
Beer is enough.
Beer is enough. Let Love roost on his perch,
And coo and coo his breath away at

The bride in orange blooms —the ivied
church —•
The two-roomed kipsy sheltered by the
hill
Sweep them aside, and fetch the frothing
bowl
To warm the cockles of one's inmost soul.
Beer is enough.
Beer is enough. Though dreamers sigh and
sigh
Of melting love, did lore e'er quench a
thirstf
Bid ever Cupid. 'neath a brazen sky
Hand out a pint to taper off a burst?
Can Daphne's lips allay the wild desire
To wade in hops, when coppers are afiref
Beer is enough.
Beer is enough. The brightest and the best
Of all the gifts the gods have handed
down! '
A nautch girl she! tuho graces all the west,
Dressed in her picture hat and. amber

There is no canker in her love—no lees
To weight one's ghost through dim eterni-
ties.
Beer is enough.
The Export of Fiction
Among the great primary industries of
this continent is literature. It is true that
the export of literature is small: this com-
modity does not figure in trade statistics: it
is unknown even to Ivnibbs, though he, him-
self, does a little private exporting of
verse-products, and his Year-Book is one
of the most valuable manufactured products
sent abroad. In most cases, however, it is
merely the partially manufactured product
that is sent abroad —the manuscript that
returns hither in the form of a novel. The
wholly manufactured product finds, of
course, an excellent local market; but, with
the exception of newspapers and official pro-
ductions, there is little literature exported
in a finished state. But the thin stream of
manuscripts drifting from our shores is re-
sponsible for a slight return flow of royalties
to Australia—and with new war-loans loom-
ing on the financial horizon, every shilling
received from exports is absolutely necessary
for Australian financial stability. Since
Australia imports the bulk of its novels, the
patriotic citizen, after having read all the
locally produced novels, should purchase the
Australian novel printed overseas. For the
patriotic Australian is thereby assuring to
Australia, in the person of the Australian
writer, the royalty profits—if any—that
would, in the ease of- an English novel,
remain in England.
But people, even though patriotic, will
not read wliat they don’t like; and no person
purchases a novel with any idea of thereby
helping Australian war finance. But if it
can 'be shown to Australian readers that
Australian writers can produce the readers’
favorite brand of fiction just as well as the
imported novelist, there is no doubt that
Australians would support the local article.
And, in certain brands of fiction goods, the
Australian novelist can equal and surpass
the Imported product. Four recent novels
prove that in the detective story, the novel
of London literary life, the humorous story
of the angel-child, and the adventure-
sentimental novel, we have writers beyond
whom, for entertainment, we need not look.
These brands of novels will not appeal to
the literary connoisseur ; but they are good,
serviceable articles that will have a wide
sale and fulfil a useful purpose. If you
want a conventional detective story, L. D.
Stranger will be pleased to supply you-with
one, set in Australia, and fully up to
sample, The Great Snake Murder (Rich-
mond, per Dymoek’s Library). If your
tastes incline to London literary life seen
from the Australian view-point, there is
Miss Bryde of England, by Alice Grant
Rosman (Melrose). If your soul needs the
humor and pathos of the good little hoy.
Isabel Maud Peacocke will delightfully tell
you all about My Friend Phil (Ward,
Lock). And the business-man, bishop
or flapper who needs the conventional
IT.S. yarn of wild-west adventure, can
have that useful article Anstralianised by
Boyd Gable in By Blow and Kiss (Tlodder
and Stoughton, per Dymock’s Library).
d*
The title, The Great Snake Murder, sup-
plies its classification. It is the usual con-
ventional detective story of a mysterious
murder in which a snake, sent in a box of
roses, kills an Australian woman. Of course,
there is a complicated will, and inevitably,
to make it harder., there are several persons
who would benefit by the death. The
mechanism of the plot is neatly constructed
and the secret of the identity of the mur-
derer as closely kept as the real name of
“L- I). Stranger.” Whoever this Little
D-; Stranger is, she knows how to write
this mechanical sort of fiction, wherein all
the characters are puppets, and less im-
portant than the strings by which they are
manipulated. And the story is obviously
Australian. But for her solution of the
murder-mystery the author has merely
adopted, and not even adapted, an ingenious
idea that has now become a commonplace.
Tim thought arises, however, whether all the
intricacies of murder plots and their expla-
nations have not long ago been worked out.
The Great Snake Murder is merely a read-
able detective-story—still, it is as readable
as the imported article.
d*
Miss Bryde of England is a very pleasant
tale. It is the story of a typically conven-
tional English girl, who, through contact
with a couple of delightful Australians in
London, gets into grips with life and gradu-
ally thaws into what may be termed the
Australian attitude. The contrast between
the narrow up-bringing of Miss Bryde and
the larger opportunities available to a girl
brought up in Australia is pleasantly indi-
cated without being patriotically' over-
stressed. There is implied criticism of Eng-
land. seen from the clear eyes of these out-
sider Australians, but never unkind criti-
cism. The alleged clever talk-of the group
of interesting people who gather around the
nucleus of the Australians’ unconventional
flat rings slightly false; but the two Aus-
tralians are quite real people. The novel is
merely an ordinary novel, done rather well.
Its value to Australian readers lies in the
impression that England and her conven-
tions make upon explorers from this con-
tinent. Its value to English readers will be
to upset some of their misconceptions about
the Australian. Alice Grant Rosman is not
concerned with vital problems: hers is a
surface view of life; but her story is
amiably and readably told.
dt
By Blow and Kiss is more than up to the
American sample. Boyd Cable can not only
turn out the Outback adventure of the neces-
sary thrill, lie can not only present us with
a typically strenuous and masculine hero
and a heroine who can be depended upon to
misunderstand him for 300 pages; but he
can set this wild and sentimental story in a
real Australian environment. There are pic-
tures of Outback conditions that are as bril-
liantly clone as by any of the Yankee ex-
perts—pictures like that of moving the
drought-stricken, starving sheep to the
ridges,* with the two carts and the sweat-
ing butchers following the mob, killing and
skinning the sheep that are too far gone:—
“The men were coated with the red dust,
and splashed and spotted with the deeper
red. Their boots and legs were soaking
despit* the dust, their arms dripped red from
the elbow, and their hands were almost too
wet and slippery to hold the blunted knives.
They worked doggedly, and with swift,
machine-like motions, slashing and ripping,
heaving the carcase over, wrenching and tear-
ing the skin off the quivering flesh." The cart
drove up, the skins were hastily flung on, the
men wiped their hands a couple of times
across the wool of the last, drew a hand
across a streaming brow, and ran to the
next group that lay huddled awaiting their
coming.” And there are equally graphic
pictures of a mob of stampeding cattle and
of a great flood. But there is no insistence
upon the harsher side of Australian life.
Boycl Cable shows that, for every blow Aus-
tralia has ready a kiss to heal that blow.
Necessarily, there is adventure in every
chapter. The false accusation of murder,
the hunted hero hiding in the ranges, wild
escapades and furious gallops—-Boyd Cable
knows what is wanted. And there is the
equally necessary misunderstanding between
the lovers, without which, of course, there
could be no adventure-novel. The humor is
obvious, the sentiment simple, the heroism
extreme; but the men and women are real,
if a little Americanised. The book is true
to its popular sample; but it is also truly
Australian.
d*
The angel-child is a stock figure in old-
maid fiction. Isabel Maud Peacocke, in
My Friend Phil, introduces us to an Aus-
tralian angel-child. Being Australian he is
naturally not so nauseous as the variety
imported to our subscription libraries from
the United States and England. Indeed Phil
is occasionally actually naughty. Of course,
Phil is the unconscious means of bringing
together a bachelor and a maid: but that is
not his sole function. His talk has the
quaintness necessary in such fiction as this;
but, despite his literary flavor, he remains
sturdily Australian. It is not the instinct
for heroism, nor an inborn courage, that
prevents him running away from the danger-
ous dog that attacks the girl. He explains
that he defended the girl, and didn’t run
away, “ ’Cos dogs can gen’rally run faster’n
little boys.” This is a sentiment that
peremptorily dismisses him from the Little
Lord Fauntlcroy class of child-heroes. Isabel
Maud Peacocke’s friend, Phil, is well worth
meeting. The story will gently amuse all
child-lovers. It is fully up to the level of
the best-imported brand of angel-child fiction.

Bulletin readers need no detailed criti-
cism of the Double-Bed Dialogues, now
published in a shilling volume, with a char-
acteristic cover by Norman Lindsay, by the
N.S.W. Bookstall Co. Most of these stories
by Henry James James have already ap-
peared in this paper. However, in the book
form each chapter is headed with extracts
from The Babette Birthday Book, a selec-
tion from which sufficiently indicates its
contents: “The only way to account for the
Average Husband is the Average Wife....
No man* ever marries one woman; he
marries an Executive Committee of her
girl friends, with his Mother-in-law in
the chair... .If Woman ever wondered about
herself, wouldn’t she be amazed—-or amused?
....A clever woman can marry any man
she wants. Judging by results, either
women are not clever or they don’t want
much. There are many ways of being
dull. The pleasantest is to be married....
Sentence of imprisonment for the term of
your natural life: ‘This is so sudden!’....
After all, a man marries a harem; —and
there’s room for all of it in one nightie.
.... The wedding breakfast begins the ro-
mance : the wedded breakfast ends it.”
I-n shilling editions you can now get

Evensong.
Not beautiful is she
That most I love and praise;
Time.weaves no witchery
About her toilsome days.
No seers or kings bow down
To laud her peerless grace;
No haughty sneer or frown
Mars her so steadfast face.
Hers is a quiet might.
All innocent of blood :
She labors day and night
To compass others’ good.
From rise to set of sun
Still is she sacrificed.
This slave of Mary’s Son,
This little bride of Christ.
Sad is she many a day.
Oft-times too sad to sing;
Hut where her footsteps stray
The sweetest flowers spring.
She has no thrilling words
To woo the throngs or tench :
She shames no quiring birds
With music of her speech.
Hut' now I sing her praise
In this my grateful song....
Priestess of simple days,
Arch-enemy of wrong!
She still with constancy
Holds open Heaven's door. . ..
The Queen of Queens is she.
The mother of the poor.

When You Awake.
A hen you awake in the friendless dark ere
the first faint roosters crow,
And Memory’s vault is opened wide to all
the winds that blow,
llien you lie and think till your brain is
dazed, and your heart is cold and numb,
For tlu> yearning dead draw near to their
own ere the first thin light-rays come.
Ah. a silent house and a ticking clock at
work in the haunted dark,
Then a sentinel rooster’s challenge faint,
and the ghosts are upon you! Hark!
I.was a footfall light in the room, I swear,
r and a cold, caressing hand
That smoothed my brow in an olden way !
Yes, I know and understand!
All forgotten they lie in their narrow graves
where we left them long ago.
And they crave the warmth of a kinsman's
thought when the icy dawn-winds blow;
ror shades are strangers for evermore,
though their tombs make white the
land.
So we hear the call of the long-stilled voice ;
and the touch of the vanished hand
1’ alls light and cold on our faithless brows
when the world’s in slumber deep,
And we lie and stare till our laggard hearts
their tryst with the dead must keep.
How comes it else that we lie inert while
the visiting shadows sit
With the books that drug our lives at hand
and the rescuing lamp unlit?
Lie down! Lie down in your darkened
)rr ,. room > ancl shed if you can a tear!
Lis but the tribute you owe your dead—■
and your own death-day draws near.
I’ riendless and cold in their graves they lie,
for Death is a tyrant power,
ho lets no poor, grey prisoner slip; but
dawn is their one brief hour.
So bring them in as you would a guest
whose heart in his breast beats still;
Commune in spirit with those who rest in
the graveyard on the hill.
'Tis the bravest, bleakest hour you’ll know.
But conquer your dread and see
That Life is at most a fire we pass in the
march of Eternity.
O Ghosts that come in the early dark, I
welcome you in with shame!
So many of you behind—before! And I'm
alone by the flame !

THE WATCHER.
The Hat.
They’ve carried him up, they have laid him
down,
A ith the smell of the harbor upon his
clothes;
The strange little man who was born to
drown,
A\ ith the little blue face that nobody knows.
The point of the chin and the curve of the
throat
Are hidden from view by a brave cravat;
And he’s buttoned up close in an overcoat;
But his head is bald—and he’s lost his hat!
Somewhere or other beneath the quay,
Bobbing about within easy touch,
Yet hiding away so that none may sec.
Is the little black hat that he needs so much.
The old black “bowler” that went with him
\\ hen he walked out under the midnight
skies;
The sheltering crown and the pulled-down
brim
That hid the purpose within his eyes.
The little black hat which I fain would
place,
Since he may not wear it upon his head,
Across the eyes and the little blue face,
And grant him the privacy of the dead.
So here is my handkerchief; even that
Must hide him from those who are round-
about,.
For a whistling urchin has found the hat
And is kicking and kicking it inside out!

THE LAST INCH OF THE FATTED
CALF’S TAIL.
By the founders of the Labor movement in
Australia an over-loaded Civil Service and
the maintenance of decorative adjuncts to
the machinery of government were regarded
as abominations. Against such wasteful
public expenditure men spoke and wrote with
passionate eloquence. Here were the weeds
that must be torn away, so that honest
administration, economy and simplicity
might bear fruit, and the burdens caused by
jobbery and ineptitude lifted from the shoul-
ders of the worker who produced all, and in
the end had to carry all. They had faith
in themselves and their doctrines, the men
who preached these things. So, in time,
the public, grown sick of seeing the annual
contributions to the State frittered away,
swept the disreputable old brigade from its
place of authority, and the new regime
arrived pledged to prudence, economy and
self-reliance. The Australian who now looks
backward and round about him for evidence
of fulfilled promise discovers himself in very
much the same position as the man who
set out to gather roses from thistles. He
finds that not only has there been failure to
realise the ideals which had such powerful
influence on the newly-enfranchised
democracy, but that these have been aban-
doned and are even treated with derision.
New conceptions have grown up with regard
to public expenditure. Lulled by sophistry
about “prosperity”; drugged by the loan-
mongers into a condition of acquies-
cence in profligacy; demoralised by the
humbug of Party Government, with
all its wretched tricks and evasions,
the people of Australia have lost their vigi-
lance, have grown uncritical, careless and,
to a very great extent, inarticulate. They
have missed the ’bus. Their relation to
Parliament differs very little from what it
was a quarter of a century ago, because
popular control of the Legislature is as great
a myth as the Legislature’s control of its
own' machine of government. The people
who were going to govern are still the gov-
erned. They are paying for it in a score of
ways; and not one quarter of the bill has
vet been presented.
* * * *
The cost of Government alone in Aus-
tralia has reached figures that are appalling.
The dreadful total of payments for Gover-
nors and Parliaments and attendant trim-
mings, including refreshment rooms, was
last year £725,265. Civil services have
swollen to abnormal proportions. Enter-
prises have been embarked on with cheer-
ful indifference to financial results. Far
and wide the scandals connected with loose
expenditure of money are common topics
of conversation. In every electorate
there is a culvert that cost a million
or something, while a bridge is falling
to pieces because someone is too tired to
drive a nail into it. In every State there
are log-rolled railways that are mops for
public money. Even such a national affair
as the Post Office has become a sieve through
which half a million disappears every year.
Land in towns and country has been re-
sumed by Governments at prices ruinous to
the struggling purchasers. Was it to achieve
this sort of thing—that the social parasite
might fatten and the speculator and boom-
ster be arrayed in fine linen—that the
era of reform was ushered in? Did
the men who made Australia to see the
old evils merely seek for the toiler an
extra shilling or two a day to be at once
rooked of it to maintain an army of public
and private parasites? No such thing can
be supposed. The unhappy truth is that the
Australian democracy has been fooled. In
return for its votes it has been loaded with
debt, and finds itself to-day burdened in an
aggravated form with every one of those
problems it set out so hopefully to solve.
Extravagant government was an evil under
Conservative rule. Does it cease to
be an evil when perpetrated under any
other sort of rule? Is waste any the less
waste under a so-called Labor Admin-
istration than under a Tory Adminis-
tration? And when through patronage Bill
is jobbed into a billet, is the jobbery any
less smellful than it was when the welkin
rang about Percy and his job and the canker
of nepotism? There is only one possible
answer to these questions; and it is because
the reply has never been translated from
words into the .guiding principles of public
policy that the Australian cash-box is leak-
ing like a water-cart. And everyone knows it
is leaking; but the traitors who put the
holes there —who for purposes of momentary
personal ascendancy betrayed the principles
of their followers —lack the courage to mend
them. In their bewilderment they can think
of nothing better than the perpetuation of
their folly, and whenever possible they pour
the proceeds of more pawn into the Treasury
while the leak grows wider and wider.

Amid wild yells about taxing the rich man
(who passes the tax on), and in the scramble
to get away with Cohen’s good cash, Minis-
tries have come to be looked upon as distribu-
tors of largesse:—a building for this sup-
porter, a bridge or two for the other, a job in
the railway cutting for Jim, and so on and
so forth. The bill is a thing to be pushed
aside as a nuisance. But that bill has to be
paid, if not to morrow then the day after
to-morrow. Until some way of abolishing
bills can be evolved, the truths that were
truths to Australia sober are truths for Aus-
tralia with a headache. These are (1) that
waste is waste; (2) that work is work; (3)
that to a debtor country production is vital;
and (4) that, where there is waste and too
little work, sooner, or later the shortage must
be made good by taxation, the weight of
which falls on th'e shoulders of the worker.
The maintenance- of seven Cocked Hats in
Australia is a waste which this taxpayer
must make good. A post office that loses half
a million a year, largely because it does not
get fair value for" the money it spends, is a
drain on the same taxpayer. Six Parliaments
are wasteful to the point of insanity. A rail-
way built on principles of shirk places a
permanent toll-gate between the producer
and his market. With the money eaten up
by the herd of white elephants at the State
capitals, by bloated civil services, by muddle
and political jobbery at the Post Office and
multitudinous other offices, by perfunctory
supervision of expenditure on works and of
revenue from services, Australia could have
been developed in these last 10 years as much
almost as it has actually been developed out
of loans, and the workers of the country
saved the shocking drain of interest created
by the recent orgy of squander. Yet even
now, with the world a bonfire, with the
national debt leaping upwards like mercury
at the equator, with the national earnings
materially diminishing and many thousands
of men leaving the Commonwealth, the hunt
for the so-called public works loan goes vigor-
ously on. Caution, economy and toil are
spoken of by the politician with apology, as
if he were a wowser detected in a pub.
Meanwhile from the West comes the voice
of Scaddan announcing that he is out a
million, and is going to be out some more
the next time the books are added up.
Peacock has folded his hands, and with a
plaintive wail of “Goo help us!” has gone
into hiding. N. S. Wales has the Norton
Griffiths shindykit tied up in the backyard,
and a riot pending among the miners. Ryan
is beginning to suspect that Denham sold
him a pup. And John Bull is being im-
plored to send along the price of another
spree—and it all sounds just. as if Aus-
tralians were the only people in the world
unable to extract a. living from a continent.
THE HUMBUG OF IT ALL.
The world is changing daily before our eyes.
Vast tracts once occupied by civilised people
are being transformed into smouldering
deserts. The great nations of Europe and
their dependencies are developing into
armed camps where only war-business is
carried on in a serious spirit. The world’s
best blood is flowing in rivers. Epic things
are being done on a thousand battlefields,
and deeds of splendid altruism are occurring
away from the firing-line. In recognition
of the fact that the British Empire is up
against the biggest problem in its stormy
history, almost every self-respecting member
of it has adjusted his point of view to meet
the exigencies of the situation. .Provision
has to be made for so much, not only now
but in the long years to come. The enemy
has to be beaten. After that mighty task
is accomplished he will need to be dealt
with, either by the confiscation of most of
his navy or by prohibitive tariffs, so that
he' may never again be in a position to con-
vulse civilisation. And then there must be-
gin the long, long argument about the spoils.
There is an unimaginably large job anead.
Nothing can ever be the same again. Hardly
anything is. the same now; the politicians
always excepted. The greater part of the
civilised world is in chaos ; Pain and Sor-
row, preceded by their friend Fear, roam
everywiiere; the poor are giving their lives,
the rich their money, and the great their
brains to the cause; and, in the midst of
the upheaval, like a dog in a dust-storm,
appears the party politician proceeding furi-
ously with his wretched business as usual.
* * * *
The party machine may be seen at work
on all sides; and everywhere its influence is
disastrous. The Fisher Government is jib-
bing at Conscription on party grounds. The
big unions are not attracted by the idea of
universal service for the purposes of over-
seas fighting. Also, there is a big floating
vote made up of Peace Society enthusiasts,
youthful shirkers and their relatives, anti-
Nationalists of the I.W.W. stamp, and many
others, which is solid against universal ser-
vice. That is why one finds Liberal patriots
of a certain brand mischievously refusing to
state their views on the subject “till the
Government has given a lead” and explain-
ing later, with tongue in cheek, that they
didn’t mean by this remark to put their
friends of the Labor party in an awkward
position —on the contrary, all they desired
was to avoid embarrassing those who are
conducting the war! Party considerations
having thrown the Holman Government out
of sympathy with Fisher, the Premier
and a number of his colleagues put
the National Government in an in-
vidious situation by joining a universal
service league and talking a policy which
they have no power to enforce, and which
they know the Fisher party is afraid to
touch. In part, this may be patriotism;
but most of it is the other thing. In N. S.
Wales the imperishable Joseph Carrutiiers
has resurrected himself and blossomed forth
in rivalry of the more moderate C. G. Wade
as a flamboyant anti-German. It is cheap
heroism to be an anti-German these days.
The only real nerve that is required is in
the case of foreign-traders like Carrutiiers
who, after a life-time spent in helping Essen
and the rest of the great German manufac-
turing centres by the advocacy of the fiscal
legislation which those places most needed,
think to purge their old offence by con-
doning the smashing of resident Germans’
windows. That variety of courage is freely
in evidence. The loudest clamorers of our
anti-German leagues are the low-tariffists of
the past. There is no Imperial purpose to
be served by putting a brick through a Ger-
man’s window. In fact, it is a regrettable
occurrence, inasmuch as it violates law and
order. The abuse that has been directed at
Holman because he deprecated this variety
of anti-GermaniSm was Liberal-party tactics
first and patriotism a very long way after-
wards. And the same applies to most of the
other humbug that, is being talked, raved
and howled respecting local Germans by
Liberals.
In the Australian Parliament a violent
row is brewing on the Referenda question.
There is not the slightest doubt that, the
Government needs additional powers if it
is to organise the Commonwealth effectively
for war purposes. Its business during the
coming months will be not merely to train
and send away so many thousand men per
month, but to clothe, arm and equip them
and supply the needed ammunition. If the
unified Government of Britain finds diffi-
culty in doing this, how much greater must
be the problem in the case of a Federal
Government such as ours, working under a
system comprising seven States each with
sovereign industrial powers? The Fisher
Government wants the new powers badly;
but it appears to want the party advantage
which is involved in the carriage of the
Referenda questions a good deal more. The
leaders of the Liberal party have admitted
that the Federal system is too weak to be
satisfactory in war-time, and that the
National Parliament requires to be strength-
ened with fresh powers. But it won’t yield
on the political dispute which has raged,
for so long round the Referenda questions
—won’t yield even to help to end the war.
It is anti-Sosh first and pro-Empire next.
There is a middle way which has been indi-
cated by The Bulletin. It would give
neither party the chance of a political tri-
umph, but it would save time and money,
and avoid that ill-feeling which is undesir-
able in a great crisis. Briefly, the scheme
is for Parliament to put through an Act con-
ferring on itself the needed powers for the'
currency of the war , which Act the High
Court would be asked to validate in toto, as
it is empowered to do under the Judiciary
Act. But the Laborites are unwilling.
They think they see in the war ■ an engine
to give them that which they failed to get
in the less urgent days of peace.. And the
Liberals won’t have any half measures. It
is their conviction that in rushing on the
Referenda questions the Fisher party is
proceeding to its doom. Thus both sides
are gambling for a party advantage at the
country’s expense.
* * *
The ceaseless old party rows are unedify-
ing at any time; at this particular period
they are shocking, as nauseating as the
spectacle of a drunk on a hearse. When
one gets down to bedrock, what are all these
vociferous little men quarrelling and slander-
ing and hurling wild and baseless
innuendoes about? It is mostly a sordid
question of personal gain. Smith has the
luck to be in office. It is Brown’s business
to get him out. To that end Brown must
fill the public mind with distrust and hatred
of Smith-; he must show that Smith, if not
of German birth, is the possessor of a Ger-
man aunt or mother-in-law or second cousin
twice removed. The implication is that
Smith’s sympathies are with Prussia; that,
in short, he is a traitor; and that the coun-
try is being betrayed. If Brown is success-
ful he gets Smith’s job; and the scandalous
business of quickly ousting him, on the only
really reliable lines available, is cheerfully
undertaken by Smith. There is something
ludricous about the circumstance that the
whole war business of a country which is
borrowing and spending in millions, and
which is sacrificing its best men with a
lavish hand, is being hampered by this
struggle for a few jobs worth about £l5 or
£2O per week. It would pay Australia well,
in the circumstances, if it could but say to
the trouble-makers in its multitudinous Par-
liaments : Take the cash and perquisites
and in return stop wasting time and get
down to solid work. With no one in Oppo-
sition, with everybody entitled to draw
(say) £l5OO per annum and to use a
Government motor-car, the incentive for all
this humbug might cease.
A LETTER TO THE FRONT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I suppose you sometimes dream, Biel, in
between the scraps out there,
Of the land you left behind you when you
sailed to do your share:
Of Oollins-street, or Itundle-street, or Pitt,
or George or Ilay,
Of the land beyond the Murray, or “along
the Castlereagh.”
And I guess you dream of old days and the
things you used to do,
And you wonder how ’twill strike you when
you’ve seen this business through,
And you try to count your chances, when
you’ve finished with the Turk,
And swap the gaudy war-game for a spell of
plain, drab work.
Well, Bill, you know just how it is these
early days of Spring,
When the gilding of the wattle throws a
glow on everything.
The olden days, the golden days, that you
remember well,
In spite of war and worry, Bill, are with
us for a spell.
For the green is on the paddocks, and the
sap is in the trees,
And the bush-birds in the gullies sing the
old, sweet melodies ;
And we’re hoping, as we hearken, that when
next the Springtide comes
You’ll be with us here to listen to that bird-
talk in the gums.
’Tis much the same old Springtime, Bill,
you recollect of yore ;
Boronia and daffodils and violets once more
Fling sweetness over city streets, and seem
to put to shame
The cult of greed and butchery that got you
in this game.
The same old, sweet September days, and
much the same old place;
Yet, there’s a subtle something, Bill, upon
each passing face :
A thing that cannot be defined, a look that
you put there
The day you landed on the beach and
charged at Sari Bair.
It isn’t that we’re boasting, lad ; we’ve done ;
with most of that —•
The froth, the cheers, the flapping flags, the
wildly waving hat.
Such things are childish memories ; we blush
to have them told ;
For we have seen our wounded, Bill, and
it has made us old.
Not with a weary child’s regret, not with a
braggart’s pride,
But with a grown youth’s calm resolve we’ve
laid our toys aside.
And it was you that taught us, Bill; upon
that fateful day,
That we at last had grown too old for ever-
lasting play.
Andv--'aS a grown man dreams at times of
boyhood days gone by,
So shall we, when the mood is here, for care-
free childhood sigh.
But, as clean youth looks out on life, clear-
visioned and serene,
So may we gaze, and ever strive to make our
manhood clean.
When all this strife is over, Bill, there yet
is work to do ;
And in the. bloodless fights to come we shall
be needing you.
We shall be needing you the more for what
you’ve seen and done,
For you were born a Builder, lad, and we
have just begun.
There’s been a deal of talk, old mate, of
what we owe to you,
Of what you’ve braved and done for us, and
what we mean to do.
We’ve hailed you as a hero, Bill, and talked
of just reward,
When you have done the : job you’re at, and
laid aside the sword.
I guess it makes you think a bit, and weigh
this gaudy praise ;
For even heroes have to eat, and there are
other days;
The days to come when we no more need
stalwart sons to fight,
When the wild excitement’s over, and the
Leeuwin looms in sight.
Then therfeis-another fight to fight, and you
will find it tough . ...
To doff the khaki for a suit of plain civilian
Stuff: , ,
When' all the cheering dies away and hero-
worship wanes, i
Yen’ll have' tp face the old drab life and
fight for other gains ;
For still your land will need you, as she
needs each sturdy son, .
To fight the fight that never knows the firing
The < quiet° fight, the steady fight, when you
shall prove your worth, .
And milk a cow on Yarra Flats or drive a
quill in Perth.
The gold is on the wattle, Bill; the sap is
in the trees, . ,
And the bush-birds in the gullies sing the
old, sweet melodies.
There’s a good, green land awaiting you
when you come home again
To swing a pick at Broken Hill or ride
Yarrowie Plain. , , , on .
The streets are gay with daffodils, but, Hag-
gard in the sun, ,
A wounded soldier passes; and we know old
days are done. , .
For down, deep down within our heaits, is
something you put there
The day you landed on the beach and
charged at Sari Bair. _

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Futility of Roars.
It boils down to this —Australia must
produce goods. Wheat and boots and meat
and blankets and all the other things, from
mouse-traps to pianolas. And it all can be
put into one word —work. That is what
Australia has to do; that is the meaning
behind all that is worth listening to in the
flood of words now pouring over the country
about “the development of industry” and
“the limitation of imports.” It is what the
shout of “Never again” should mean if it
were an honest, one. But it happens that
this phrase has been debased to the level
of a mere catch-cry. The mouths from
which it issues with the loudest roar are
very much more concerned about making a
violent noise than giving helpful counsel
to the nation. These people are in the
majority of cases not interested in the point
that is of vital consideration to Australia.
They keep on harping day and night about
Germany—about “smashing German trade”
and not having any more business .transac-
tions with the Hun. and similar meaningless
nonsense. But how often do Australians
hear from these windbags any warning
against the perpetuation of the system of
which our trade with Austria and Germany
was only a detail? They know that econo-
mically there has been no change, that what
was fundamentally rotten before is growing
putrid now, and that instead of Australia
feeding one set of aliens she is busy doing
nothing to prevent another lot growing fat.
This is no use to Australia. It means stick-
ing in the same old hole, snoozing con-
tentedly in the sun, borrowing sixpence to
get an imported drink, and gassing about
our “abounding prosperity.” Cackle about
the throttling of German trade is of exactly
the same type of foolishness as the enemy’s
frantic strafing of England. Whatever the
result of the war, German factories and
workshops and laboratories will be reaching
out for trade before the soldiers have hung
their rifles up—and they will be getting a
share of it. Sixty million people cannot be
tied .up like a tribe of Esquimaux. But
consideration of what is going to happen
to the aniline dye, and the cheap watch, and
the piano which was born in Stuttgart but
proclaims itself as of the Bulldog Breed, is
, minor importance to Australia compared
with what is going to happen to Australian
trade. If when the war is over the country
is still afflicted with the same old lunacy
of wearing the imported sock and the in-
dented singlet—if it is wearily sending
lumps of copper over the sea and dragging
back copper saucepans and wire—then it
might as well get its socks and saucepans
from Hamburg as from Shanghai or Ala-
bama. Therefore The Bulletin wishes to
make the casual remark that the time
is ripe to knock off blowing out hot-air
regarding the Hun and to get down to busi-
ness here in Australia.
John Bull and Conscription.
Little comfort was to be got out of last
week’s news from the British Parliament.
Kitchener’s army, amazing estimates of
which had been published in American maga-
zines, is any unknown quantity in excess of,
say. 1,500,000. The inexplicit Asquith
spoke of “an aggregate of not far short of
•>,000,000 men who have offered their services
to the navy and the army.” No hint was
given as to what proportions had been offered
to the respective services, or how many of the
offers had been turned down by the medical
examiners. Of those actually accepted for
the army, A. C. Ameby, M.P., said that
“several drafts had been sent back because an
officer reported that it would be murder to
send old men into the trenches. Another
officer had told him that there were any num-
ber of unfit who were unable to march or
shoot.” All that Kitchener could say to
make the House of Lords happy was : “There
is now abundant evidence of a process of
demoralisation having set in among the
Turks”—which has been said once a week in
the imaginative press since the end of April.
It was said of Austria a year ago. As for
the life or death question of conscription,
Kitchener merely spoke of “whatever sacri-
fices may prove to be necessary,” and
Asquith enveloped himself in the usual
clouds of “ifs” and “buts.” Meanwhile, a
couple of million able-bodied slackers are
fooling away the time they should be devot-
ing to drill, and the absurd policy of “put-
ting the best face on it” encourages the
Thomases, of the House to threaten revolu-
tion if universal service is introduced. A
democracy has a perfect right to turn down
conscription if the majority feels that way,
just as the majority has the right to decide
to eat the German leek if it likes that food.
But in a democracy it is the most criminal
thing in the world for any party to talk
revolution in order to get its own way ; and it
is little less than criminal for a Government
not to set out the whole of the facts for the
democracy’s guidance.

The Failure of the Policy of Borrow
and Bloat.
The enormously over-capitalised Great Cobar
Co., owned principally in England and
France, has, been gradually drifting into
worse and worse difficulties for five years
past, and now threatens to close down
altogether, in its extremity it approached
the N. S. Wales Government for a loan. The
party caucus considered the proposal, and
turned it down. Nevertheless, Holman
cabled to London that the State would stand
behind the co. for £40,000. Then lie called
a meeting of the Caucus, explained that
when Estell, the Minister for Mines, brought
the matter forward a couple of weeks before,
“he was unable to do himself justice,” and
proceeded to convince the crowd that any
apparent lack of candor in connection with
the affair had been “accidental.” Finally, of
course, he asked for ratification of his action.
Caucus strained horribly at the bolus Hol-
man offered, but swallowed it at last—and
has felt very unwell ever since. For this
hole-and-corner gambling transaction the only
shadow of justification advanced is (T) that
unless the company had been supplied with
£40,000 several hundred men would have been
thrown out of work; (2) that Mr. Holman
would have been bothered by them. The
same plea could, of course, be advanced for
shoring up the business of every incompetent
and bungling trader in the community; and
when the assistance is granted to a foreign
concern, how can it be consistently denied to
our own citizens? Still, discreditable as the
whole business is, it has its value since it
illustrates the fatuity of the wild borrowing
policy. Millions and millions have been
raised and squandered in every direction to
the great profit of sharks of every degree-
and the net result of it all is that the State
is less able to absorb the labor and industry
of the people than it was 50 years ago.

The Drunk and the Doctor.
The Bulletin has been waiting impatiently
for some time in the expectation that some-
one would do something or other in the
matter of Dr. Edgar Caro, of Sydney. He
applied recently for letters of administra-
tion in the estate of one Arthur Jamieson,
who had died in his private hospital. Jamie-
son was an inebriate who, in the words of
Justice Street, delivering judgment on
August 4, had “impaired his bodily health
and probably weakened his mental powers
by the life he had led.” He was brought to
Dr. Caro’s hospital suffering from the effects
of a drinking bout. He complained of pain,
and the doctor proposed giving him morphia.
Before doing so he suggested that the ruin
should make a will. The ruin agreed. The
doctor suggested that whatever property he
had should be left to him “to use for moral
and religious purposes.” Again the wreck
said yes. It may be noted here that, to again
quote the probate Judge, “Dr. Caro was
almost a complete stranger to deceased.”
The will made, the doctor administered a
quarter of a grain of morphia. An hour
later another quarter of a grain was given.
A few hours after that the patient died. In
his certificate the doctor said that the cause
of death was urinea. Faced later with a
grave medical difficulty, he explained that
when he said urinea he meant heart failure,
or words to that effect. The Judge in dis-
missing the doctor’s application and refusing
him costs out of the estate said that “the
dispositions in the will did not come spon-
taneously from testator,” that Caro’s explan-
ation respecting the death certificate was not
satisfactory “as to its sincerity o,r its genu-
ineness,” that he had not been sufficiently
candid and frank, and his conduct generally
had been unsatisfactory. The British Medi-
cal Association is relentless with the doctor
who advertises. A year or so ago it aston-
ished many thousands of people by expelling
a doctor who had associated himself with a
“manipulator”—a gifted person who had
cured many cases of dislocation and the like
by unorthodox methods. Here is a doctor
whose conduct has called for this scathing
reflection from the Bench —who has done
something far more discreditable (at any
rate, in the eyes of those on whom the pro-
fession depends for a living) than if he had
paid for a recital of his merits in every
paper in the Commonwealth ; and though he
may not be a quack, as the profession under-
stands the term, yet on his own evidence he
has given an incorrect death certificate.
There is another conceivable aspect of the
case, namely that the death certificate sup-
plied the correct explanation of the patient’s
death. In that event, another and more
serious field for inquiry is opened up. But
in either case the position is one which calls
for investigation by somebody. Any old
scrutiny would give the community a greater
sense of security than the murky silence
which has followed the judicial blistering.
A Thriving Industry, and the Sure Way
to Discourage It.
A witness before a N. S. Wales Parlia-
mentary Committee had this to say a few
days ago:—
I saw a series of advertisements in the Herald
requesting people to apply for the adoption of little
infants. I was so appalled at the thought of the
future prospects of these infants that I cut out the
advertisement and sent it to Mr. Green, and asked
whether his department could net take steps to pre-
vent the insertion of such advertisements. He told
me that Dr. Mackellar wrote to the Herald asking
that such advertisements should not be inserted
because of the terrible effect involved to the com-
munity and to these little waifs of children, but the
Herald still continued to insert the advertisements.
I think it ought to be an offence for the Herald or
any other paper to insert such advertisements asking
people for a premium for adopting children.
The private-enterprise baby-farmer is one of
The Bulletin’s oldest acquaintances. The
effect of her activities on the population
problem is almost as great as that of her
cousin-german, the abortionist. The “kind
lady wing take chd, cash dn, no quests,”
needs to advertise only when she is em-
barking on the profession. After she has
been in business for a while she gets a “con-
nection,” like any other successful practi-
tioner, and thereafter her calling runs itself.
There are two varieties who operate, with
moderate security, behind the ramparts which
guard the British subject’s home. The first
is a plain murderess, who for a matter of
£25 or so takes in a baby on the understand-
ing that she is to look after it for life. If
the child gets as much as £5 worth of exist-
ence it is all it can fairly expect in the cir-
cumstances. The second variety boards the
unwanted infant for a few shillings weekly
This system is liable to be crueller in the
long run than the direct-slaughter method
Every now and then the community is
shocked by police-court cases in which women
are proceeded against for having in their
possession children, emaciated and vermin-
ous, who are mostly described as the offspring
of the accused, but who are reasonably sus-
pected by the Court of being waifs. A
case came under notice the other day of a
slum household which featured three small
children. They belonged ostensiblv to the
people who rented the dwelling. The
alleged mother went daily to work, leaving
the babies tied by their legs to tables and
chairs, with a little bread soaked in sugar
and water within reach. Just as it is im-
possible for the authorities to know how
many abortions occur per annum, so it is
impossible for them to locate a fraction of
the people who go in for baby-farming in a
quiet way. It is no doubt lamentable that
tli' - ' press should aid and abet such a business,
but whoever thinks that the abuse is to be
ended, or even greatly reduced, by the mak-
ing of baby-fanning advts. an offence sup-
plies the last word in optimism. The only
way to save the .life of the unwanted child,
on a large scale, is for the State to provide
institutions where mothers can leave such
children. Also, our social laws being what
they are, the mother must be able to aban-
don her infant with as much secrecy as
though she had taken it to a baby-farm.
The wowser is bound to wail at the notion
of Sin being shielded from punishment, and
at the scandal of the State entering into
competition with assassins. But the State
can always reply that the preservation of
human life is of greater moment than either
of these things.
Let us contemplate our Holman in his advo-
cacy of Conscription:—
When one reads of the whole of the undergraduates
of Oxford and Cambridge serving in the trenches—
men who represent the intellectual elite of Britain;
upon whom Britain will have to rely for leadership
in years to come —one cannot help feeling that it is
a pity there is not some power to intervene and send
these men back to positions where they would be
doing still more valuable service for their country,
and replace them at the Front by other men who
are equally good as fighters, but whose departure for
the Front would cause less of a gap in civil life.
Either Holman believes this, in which case
he is a snob and utterly unfit to be leader of.
a democratic party, or he doesn’t believe it,
and was trying to turn the conscription move-
ment into ridicule, in which case he is a
traitor in the National Service party. Wher-
ever the truth may be, a petition should
immediately be circulated for signature im-
ploring him, in the interests of the nation, to
hold .his tongue. Meantime this deliverance
of his should be framed and suspended at
the P.L.L.’s place of meeting as the most
awful sample of blither in the Australian
Labor party’s history. It should help the
men who sweat for a living to measure up
the glib and shallow humbug who has been
masquerading as a “leader of the demo-
cracy” all these years.
The organisation of British scientific
resources seems bound to result in the
crushing defeat of extensively-advertised
German “nerve foods” and things. Thanks
to costly advertising, numerous brands of
German goods had pushed all competitive
compounds off the market; but with the
sudden aversion to the Hun came a new
confidence in local inventive capacity. Fol-
lowing Professor Ray Lankester’s critical
study of modern scientific achievement,
showing how little was the part Germany
had played in it, old Sir William Crookes
and others struck a deep note of disrespect
for German kultur, since when Britain’s
deep-rooted faith (watered by advertisement
streams) in the virtue of the German pre-
parations has withered away under the hot
blast of rival advertisements. These old
costly “foods” of one sort and another were
originally exploited on the supposition that
Germans were pre-eminent in inventive
genius. Crookes mildly remarked that it
was a supposition which was inexplic-
able to French and British chemists. The
greatest discoveries had been made outside
of Germany, and it was absurd to think
that any of the reputable commercial pro-
ducts of the enemy country couldn’t be
equalled or excelled bv British firms. The
ball, of disrespect for German boastfulness
having been thus set rolling, it gathers as it
goes along. Every German is as ardent an
advertiser of everything German as a
stinking-fish” Australian is a derider of all
things manufactured in his own country.
'^ c . world . was bluffed, bounced and
Loodled into taking pretensions of the enemy
much, too seriously. But the many-sided
conspiracy has come to light, and is being
scrutinised now from all points of view.
Ihe Old Soldier” theorises:—
The tremendous extension of the Austro-German
armies is becoming too great, apparently, for even
the resources of the two Empires. Germany and
Austria combined cannot conquer Russia, because
they cannot support the necessary burden of the
operations sufficiently to win decisive victories. The
black-soil plains over which their armies must neces-
sarily plough their slow and toilsome way are prac-
tically impassable for heavily-laden baggage trains
and artillery, except at a very slow pace. The
enormous extension of the three'fronts on which the
two central Powers are fighting, though it gives them
what strategists call the “interior lines,” gives them
no line of retreat, and compels them to carry on the
war of entrenchments that has been forced on them
to the last extremity, no matter how long that may
It is a war that must depend for its duration on
the resources of the Powers engaged, and the two
central Powers have madly, apparently in despair
burdened themselves with an impoverished ally in
Turkey, under the belief that the Unspeakable held
the greatest strategical position in Europe at Con-
stantinople. It is certainly a great position, and
would be an immensely strong one if there were
adequate resources available for its defence; but the
Turk cannot command them in either men or
material, and there is the Hun’s difficulty. He is
himself very hard pressed on every front —on none
can he much more than hold his own —-and if he
could spare help he cannot send much of it to
distant Constantinople, because every road is being
rapidly closed. Furthermore his enemies are learn-
ing to supply themselves with warlike stores, and
they are acquiring the new cult of siege-war—sap-
ping and mining-—and are accordingly becoming really
dangerous opponents. In all of which respects the
Hun is up against trouble.

The deluge of talk in Melbourne about
organising the fish-distributing industry has
washed up some interesting facts. In the
Melbourne Fish Market recent wholesale
prices of certain fish have been: —
June. July. August.
Salmon trout . . .. 5Jd. 44d. 3d.
Mullet 2d. lid. 2Jd.
Flathead . . . . . . 4Jd. 4|d. 4d.
Whiting .. .. .. 6d. s}d. 74d.
At the same time the prices in retail shops
ranged from Is. to as much as 2s. per lb. !
In the outer suburbs such comparatively
dainty fish are unobtainable, and even the
common barracouta is frequently sold at Is.
per lb. Minor relevant facts are that meat
is costing from Is. a lb. upwards; that cer-
tain fishermen at Port Franklin say they
reap the rich return of from -]d. to Jd. per
lb. for their catches; and that these fisher-
men offer to sell their catches to the Govern-
ment at Id. per lb. all round. The Govern-
ment has set John Weary to look into the
matter; so why the nefarious middlemen
should he in such a hurry to fleece the pub-
lic Heaven only knows.
The curse of “Quidam” :
The idea imbedded in the minds of Australian fruit-
growers appears to be that the principal desiderata
for the prosperity of the industry are wages of about
ss. a day and prices ranging from 10s. a case up-
wards. If shorn of these advantages they prophesy
nothing but ruin. This view has lately received a
shock by the publication of an account of the apple-
growing industry in Hood River Valley, Oregon
(U.S.A.), by a former resident of Dural (N.S.W.).
Wages there, it seems, range from Bs. a day upwards,
even Japanese packers getting 9s. a day, and striking
occasionally, while the grower nets only about 4s. a
case. Codlin moth, bitter pit, apple scale and
water core are all in evidence, and have to be com-
bated by spraying, etc. ; yet the industry is on such
a solid footing that, with raw land at from £2O per
acre upwards, and clearing from £lO to £3O per
acre, £6OO and £BOO per acre has been refused
for bearing orchards. The outstanding features of
the industry are that all fruit has to be graded and
packed according to certain standards, inspectors
being continually employed in preventing any
departure from these standards, and refrigerator cars
and cold-storage plants stop serious deterioration
of the fruit on its way from the orchard to the
consumer. So long as each Australian grower packs
his fruit according to a standard of his own, so that
about 200 sizes and qualities of fruit can be obtained
from any case labelled “Extra choice,” so long will
the Yankee industry be considerably more profitable
than ours. When the Australian grower organises
his calling on business lines, and when, instead of
moaning mournfully about prohibitive wages, he uses
his brain more and his hands less, he will begin to
discover that it is not outgo alone that matters,
but the difference between his expenditure and his
income. The thought of employing labor gives the
average Australian horticulturist the jumps ; yet the
really get-rich-quick person devises a method by
which he can employ 50 laborers and get a profit out
of each. It is that which allows the American
growers to buy motor-cars, while the parsimonious
Australian, who puts his brains into cold storage,
goes to sleep in a spring dray.

Some remarks of The Bulletin re Sir
Edgar Speyer are reprinted in a booklet,
"The House of Speyer,” published by the
London Financial Mail. It is mainly a
collection of articles dealing with Speyer’s
financial past and his present position as an
English baronet and- Privy Councillor. Its
incidental revelations are even more depress-
ing than its direct attacks on the German
hanker whose British title is shared by a Ger-
man wife. A list of his flotations since 1897
is mostly a record of bad investments for the
British public; yet Prime Minister Asquith,
writing to him on May 22 last, said: “The
King is not prepared to take any step in
regard to the marks of distinction which you
have received in recognition of public ser-
vices and philanthropic munificence For
example, the Madeira Railway 51- per cent,
mortgage bonds, which this munificent philan-
thropist offered for subscription at 971 in
1913, were down to 29f a couple of months
ago. But it seems waste of time to cast any
further suspicion on the character of
Asquith’s friend. It is enough that his
business is linked with that of his German
father in Frankfurt and of his German bro-
ther in New 7 York, the brother being openly
friendly with Dernburg, the truculent “diplo-
matist” wdio —as the Morning Post put it- -
“arranged the matter of the Lusitania.” More
disheartening than any of the facts concern-
ing the notorious aliens who have led!
Asquith by the ear is the exposure of Ger-
man influence in the War Office. The war
was already three months old when the
Financial Mail said :
Our Government possesses near Enfield a beauti-
fully-equipped factory for explosives. A well-known
firm of engineers, being anxious to supply machinery,
asked for drawings and specifications, 'but was in-
formed by the Government officials that all such
particulars were in the hands of Werner, Pfleidereu
and Perkins, Ltd., an engineering firm with huge
works in Germany and offices in London.
And the trouble is that nobody can feel hope-
ful that the German influence has even yet
completely spent itself in Britain.

“Real Australian’s” protest:—-
In order to plan an Australian arsenal the Defence
Department is sending five men to India, not one of
whom, I believe, has any expert knowledge about an
arsenal. What use are two engineers, a University
teachei, a. chemist and a gunner in planning ar,
arsenal? Why not give George Sydenham Clarke,
now Lord Sydenham, the job? Why not ask the
Director of Ordnance at Woolwich to put on a couple
of draughtsmen to prepare and forward plans? What
wild extravagance it is to make a picnic for five
people to a place like India, which has no modern
arsenal, and which depends to-day on Vickers’ and
Armstrongs' for all its shells and guns and rifles 1

Is the Empire Fighting Over Words or
For Its Life?
The meaning of it all is simple enough.
Are we going to save our bacon? The
answer to that settles the rumpus concern-
ing national service. There are three pos-
sible results —victory, defeat or an adjourn-
ment. By Britain and incidentally by Aus-
tralia the two latter contingencies are
synonymous with disaster. John Bull and
little Johnnie have either to take a hiding
or give the other fellow one, and the only
sane way to set about doing this latter is
to organise for the job on lines that, besides
leading to the maximum of damage to the
enemy, will cause the least amount of injury
to the victors. Expressed in terms of pounds,
shillings and pence, every month that is
spent in shilly-shallying with vital questions
represents stupendous economic loss; every
life sacrificed because of the army being of
inadequate size for its job is an asset
wasted. The Empire can’t turn back: it
must go on. Then what is the use of quib-
bling.about the meaning of conscription and
splitting verbal hairs on the subject of
national service? It was long ago evident,
lr j spite of the conspiracy to keep the truth
hidden, that the war was going to be one
of terrible intensity, that the enemy was
powerful, well-equipped and resourceful,
that with the Allies things were going
not too well. Shortages of
were at last revealed —of shells, of
machine-guns, of rifles, of men. The
experiment had been tried by Britain
or conducting a war of life and death in
the gloom of secrecy, from which the facts
only emerged by accident; and even now,
after all the glozing half-truths of a year
have been swept away, the officialdom which
chloroformed the nation into a fatuous sense
of security palters in timid, wavering hesi-
tancy with the shibboleths of peace and the
stark realities of war. The broad outlines
of the mighty struggle on land are clear
enough.. Russia is reeling backwards; on
Gallipoli the Allies have little more than a
foothold; the Italian advance into Austria
is being firmly disputed; in Belgium and
France the enemy holds his ground. The
need for every pound of pressure which the
nation can exercise is not disputed. If that
pressure can .be applied in any other way
than by calling to arms everyone who is
able to strike a blow against enslavement,
the only nation which shrinks from the task
should. explain what the method is. If
there is no working alternative, then the
flustered doctrinaires who object to defeat
beina averted by victory over their formula
should take themselves to a remote place and
crawl out again when the world has brousrht
tho great strmrerle to an end. These are
times for blood and action, not for subdued
combats about words.

Asked to select a successor in the State
Assembly to “Ted” Larkin, killed at Galli-
poli, Willoughby (Sydney) electors last
week had a Labor man and five nondescripts
to choose from. A third of the electors
voted, and the poll was so close between
Chambers (Labor) and John Haynes that
a second ballot will be taken on Saturday.
Haynes’s return would be a warning to
every man not to quit his billet lest an
enemy should collar it. Therefore at this
juncture,. when the encouragement of re-
cruiting is the main consideration, even the
Liberal electors of Willoughby should recog-
nise that their urgent national «mty is to
assist in returning the of tne same
color as' the man whose ’dace —e chosen
member will fill. Haynes should accord-
ingly go out with the most emphatic thud in
history.
“Mil” : The English position is almost im-
possible of belief. Compared with the German
menace of Britain, Australia is at peace
and impregnable; yet the attitude of the
British is plainly shown by the affirmation
of the anti-conscription resolution of the
Trades Union Congress at Bristol represent-
ing three million unionists. And those three
million unionists represent 15 or 16 millions
of the 47 millions of the U.K. The War
Committee of Workers made representa-
tions to the Government against the ex-
ploitation of bread and coal; but this drift-
ing Asquith Government wouldn’t or
couldn’t move. The Trades Union Congress
affirmed “that the workers were prepared
to make sacrifices for the common cause, but
they would not be bled by financial vul-
tures.” They invited Lloyd George to
“fulfil his promise to deal with war profits.”
The truth is this British Government has
too many wealthy friends—coal-mine own-
ing friends, contractor friends, friends who
can delay the declaration of cotton as con-
traband for nearly 10 months of war. The
Trades Unionist Congress is obstinatelv
short-sighted, but its vision is not to be
cleared by the spectacle of old men who,
over the eligible age themselves, advocate
conscription while piling up war profits,
exploiting food and firing, and handing out
to labor pre-war or less than pre-war wages.
Conscription must come; but plainly the
working men of England will not listen to it
until it also means abolition of war profits.

“From Mill Girl to Millionairess” is the
current insanity at Sydney Adelphi. It is
by Mrs. Morton Powell, the authoress of
“The Bad Girl of the Family” and “The
Lamb. Who Took the Wrong Turnip.” Per-
haps it is just as well that Shakspeare died
when he did; if he had lived into our impati-
ent times circumstances might have com-
pelled him to write blood-boilers of this type,
too. As it was he only got as far as Ham-
let, who was “The Mad Boy of the Family” ;

then he went, and Mrs. Powell, who remains,
has to do her best. Her mill girl is just as
enterprising as her other creations. One
lady (the respectful morning paper calls her
a “lady”), who is after a coronet and the
earl under it, stabs her mother in the back,
shells an orphanage and sets fire to a house
in order to get square with other characters
who have “resolved upon her ruin.” She is
unmasked and foiled just when the wedding-
bell-ringers are preparing to spit on their
hands. The fact that the villain has been
publicly blamed for being lackadaisical seems
to indicate either that he is a short-winded
scoundrel or that he would rather be nailing
a fowl-house together in a far suburb. Still
he threatens his mistress very nicely in the
third act, while the hero walks through the
play pleading helplessly for information like
a plain-clothes policeman. Out of consid-
eration for their feelings, this paper will not
publish the names of the players who are
implicated.

Joseph Blascheck, assisted more or less
by Miss Alyce Austin, started a brief season
at the Little Theatre, Sydney, on Saturday;
and the people with ldndly memories of
this entertainer’s art who found their way
to the remote place sniffed at the mustiness
of the house, which had had a long rest
from shows and showmen. Blascheck was
not at the top of his form, and Miss Austin
was not much in the way of reinforcements.
She is an attractive girl with a crisp touch
on the piano; but her voice is hardly up to
platform requirements, and she works so
hard over some of her items that she forces
her audience to work with her.

Stafford and Co. (there appear to be two

Mary Elizabeth, costers Duncan and God-
frey, Terry and Lambert, Edward Warwick’s
burlesquers, shooting Pisano and scribbling
Ivajayama. Maud Fane, the clever little
lady-member of the Warwick team, is under-
stood to have musical-comedy ambitions.
She is just the sort of singing comedienne
who would save a dull show and make a
bright one sparkle.

“Other times, other manners.” If “Ma
Mie Rosette,” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.),
strikes the present generation as being not
quite all that Dad and Mum had cracked it
up to be, the p.g. must understand that
times have changed. Compared with the
show that brought “I Was Dreaming” into
fashion, the present one is sicklied o’er with
a pale change of cast, and situations of
great bygone moment with this regard their
currents turn awry and lose a lot of action —
as Hamlet would say. All the same, “Ma
Mie Rosette” was well worth revival. It
is a tuneful, romantic opera, with good,
durable stuff in it. In fact, Henri of
Navarre as an historic personage is all the
better for being even more dead than when
Brownlow took the floor in long buff boots
and turned his roving eye on Nellie Stewart.
Given the right type of baritone in the part
of the mashful monarch, and a more courtly
crowd of fair women and bearded men in
the Chateau scene, the other shortcomings
wouldn’t seem to matter much.
* * * *
Derek Hudson is a satisfactory Henri only
when he sings. He lacks inches, mannah
and necessary medieval royalty about the
legs. He frowns when he. should express
urbanity, he has not the crudest notions of
suave seductiveness, and when he has nothing
to say or . sing he doesn’t count in the pic-
ture. Miss Cadman makes just a charming
Rosette as far as she goes. Her tuneful pre-
sentation of a cup of milk to the King, and
some of her tiff with the rustic Vansong in
the first act, are admirably done. It is when
she talks back to Corisande, and subsequently
goes looking for trouble in her nightie, that
Miss Cadman shows her want of dramatic
ginger and business resource. Reg Roberts
is the best-placed member of the co. His
somewhat weird accent is permissible in a
young Navarrean hayseed of long ago, and
as soon as he drops his Y.M.C.A. method of
playing the lover and begins to chuck his
feelings off his chest, Reginald is really force-
ful and even magnetic. The chief honors of
Saturday night’s performance fell to Van-
song. He was a devil of a Roberts when
roused, and his rough treatment of Rosette
when he caught her in her nightie and
Henri’s arms was worth all the money
charged for admission. Miss Ethel Morxi-
son is an unduly large, loud and emphatic
Corisande. . Phil Smith is always pretty
good as Bouillon, whilst Addie Lennard is a
very variable Martha, and Bantock suggests
an old warrior who is sadly out of condition.

The last nights of “Under Cover” will
probably last another week at Melbourne
Royal, after which Muriel Starr and the
felodramatic co. are to appear in “Nobody’s
Widow,” described as pure, unadulterated
comedy.
“What Happened to Mary” before is
happening to Mary again at Melbourne
King’s, but it is a new heroine who is leav-
ing powder, on John Willis’s breast. Miss
Lesley Adrienne is the lady now, and she
gives girlish emphasis to the in-no-cence
that matches her flaxen hair and her far-
away look. No one seeing the actress could
deny her physical suitableness for the part.
She seems the predestined rural victim of
the dinners and cash proffered by the young
Nut in yachting flannels. Richard Bellairs
is the aforesaid youth, whose disrepute is
presented with a crushing wardrobe and a
smile ample for all purposes. In general
wickedness he is a varnished chip of the old
block. . Edmund Duggan is the old block;
and his scowling, unsteady glance is sup-
posed to suggest that his child-abandonment
lies, heavy on. his mind. The old man has
obviously a bigger burden on his waistband
than on his thinking apparatus, but that is
the festive result of circumstances over
which an expensive appetite has most con-
trol. Bert Bailey in the semi-nautical ap-
pointments of Cap’n Jogifer loads the pro-
ceedings with sea wheezes and plods along
on a stiff leg as before. Miss Roberts’ sniv-
elling is out of tune for the part of Henry
Craig’s soiled dove ; the effectiveness of Mrs.
Winthrop (Miss Bevan) is somewhat ham-
pered by a voice with grit in it; and the
way Guy Hastings as John Willis grabs his
Mary in the end shows that his previous
rigid decorum was only worn in business
hours. Other individual achievements are
Tuck Wintergreen (Fred Macdonald) and
Mrs. Peart (Miss Adeson), who tickle the
public with varying success.

The Follies, now back at Melbourne Tiv-
oli, are mostly the same Cannot, Isabelle
D’Armond and Vera Pearce, etc., in a more
or less different assortment of items. The
difference between a Follies turn and any
ordinary turn of Tivoli commerce is that it
doesn’t last long and never takes an encore,
which is a praiseworthy peculiarity. Frank
Greene is the new man who sings alone, or
v/ith the same old chorus, in the garden by
the sea, and Greene’s limited range of warble
is generally understood to have soulful in-
tentions. The opening part of the pro-
gramme is supplied by the nimble Crouch
and Welch, Alfredo, Weems, Desmond and
Dalton, some of whom crop up as Follies
later on.

Piquo, a clown of quaint energv on the
horizontal bar, and Maud and Gill, two
bouncing trampoline experts, are leading
the acrobatic division at Melbourne Bijou
this week. In the forefront of the vocal
brigade are Ward Lear, George Fredo and
Annita Primrose. Ward has made the imi-
tation of squeaky wheels and similar noises
his life work, while Fredo is a Dutch-
Amurkan musician and joke-fancier who
exhibits several japes which he caught quite
young. Finally there is Miss Primrose, a
female impersonator who reveals her
changes of costume in full view of the
audience. The turn is not particularly well
acted or sung, but the lady’s figure gives it
a sort of physiological interest.

This week the Hoyt management in Mel-
bourne is illustrating the charms of the
popular film actress, Marguerite Clark, in

tinue the hurried narration of the mining

form and bandar^.
In the middle act of “Playing with Fire”
(produced by the Adelaide Repertory
Theatre) Schnitzler unexpectedly manages
to be dull. The quiet, rather gloomy Franz
gives a careless affection to Christine, who
lives for him only. Presently he is killed
in a duel over another woman, and she has
a nervous breakdown. Beginning and end,
good; second act, plain padding. The acting
was sound, as usual. Whether Christine is
supposed to have charm does not appear; Ivy
Stacey stressed the jealous and exacting
side of the character, and rose well to the
painful scene at the end. Neill gs lover
and Nave as father did Well the little they
had to do, Ray Walsh as a careless friend
was amusing at the start and dignified at
the finish, and Kitty Sullivan was delightful
as a reckless little milliner. This lady has
all the charm of the born actress who has
not yet acquired professional stage-tricks.
The prompter played an unusually fine in-
nings in this piece. The other item of the
evening was “Halt!” a ode-act thrill by a
clever Adelaide lady whose name everyone
knows but who shrinks from print. The
construction is amateurish, an entirely un-
necessary character being brought in at
curtain-rise, and two more at its fall; but
the central idea is well worked. The girl,

only to fade out of the story after three
sentences. The Repertory Theatre has made
a popular move into Cawthorne’s new and
central Queen’s Hall, and in these distress-
ful times the appearance of apparently-real
champagne earned a hearty round of ap-
plause io itself.

The drama in Adelaide is getting busy
again at last. lan Maclaren, Charlotte Ives
and a strong co. begin an absurdly-short sea-
son at the Royal with three evenings of the
Gibraltar spy play, “Within the Lines.”
Simultaneously, the Tivoli —which has had
Miss Barr and her variety co. for a week —
starts “Lady Godiva,” oddly (but correctly)
described as a “costume drama,” with Elwyn
Harvey to do the bareback-riding act. Sil-
ver, Parsons and Alderman played finely on
their respective instruments at a Town Hall
“patriotic.” At the King’s, Frank Sidney
leaps, Poincare imitates birds and things,
ventriloquist George Ford continues to'be in-
sulted by his wooden friend, and a Victor
Prince combination puts up a long turn
which it calls “revusical.”
A real veteran has died in Adelaide —
Charles Hill, who came to Australia in the
ship that brought the first news of -the
Crimean war, and was promoter of the
Society of Arts of South Aus. in 1856. Art
was always his strong point, and engraving
his specialty. His drawings for an official
picture of the Great Exhibition’s opening
in 1851 brought him the acquaintance of
the Duke ’Of Wellington; and he could talk
of having supped with Tom Hood. He was
91 when the end came.
Another R.C. bishop has gone beyond the
border, Dr. Higgins, of Ballarat, having set
out last week. He was 77 and had been in
the priesthood for nearly 60 years. His first
post in Australia was as auxiliary to Car-
dinal Moran at Sydney; then he went to
Rockhampton to complete and open a cathe-
dral and acquire 19 new churches; and in
1905 lie landed at Ballarat. The clergy of
the diocese had petitioned for the appoint-
ment of Arch-priest Marshall as bishop, but
Higgins was' the lifelong' friend of Arch-
bishop Carr and got the appointment. He
devoted lljmself with great earnestness to
building schools, homes and hospitals, con-
tributing generously to the funds from his
own purse, for the kindly riverence was a
rich man and the brother of one who was
richer still.
So many mistakes have been made by our
side that it is a tonic to read of the mis-
takes of the enemy in organisation—the
point on which he was supposed to be
strongest. A writer with inside knowledge
relates that some'jackets were wanted for
the prisoners’ camp at Posen, and a dealer
got the order, though he did not know where
to find the goods. He applied to a business
friend, who applied to another, and the
jackets were got from a factory in Thurin-
gia. The manufacturer charged six marks
apiece, but on their way to Posen they went
round by Breslau and Berlin, passing
through seven hands and leaving sixpence in
each, so that at their destination they cost
the Government 9J marks. Such muddles
were mostly the fault of badly rattled Gov-
ernment departments which allowed house-
agents to contract for carriage wheels, and
so forth. In poor old Austria things were
worse. But things always are worse in
Austria.
“Costs” : Government departments remind
me of a harmless old lunatic they once had
at New Norfolk (Tas.). Their foible is
producing forms and regulations. Hers was
washing clothes. The other day I had to
collect some money for a soldier who before
leaving for Tophet executed a power of
attorney in my favor. I called on the mili-
cary paymaster and explained that I was
an attorney appointed under seal and all
the rest of it. No good. To begin with he
said he had never heard of my man, and to
prove that it was not worth while finding
out whether he existed informed me that in
any case I must get a “pay-agent” form
executed. The. power of attorney was as
useful as a tailor’s bill. Anywhere else it
would and does answer all purposes; but in
his dealings with the one department from
which my man ought to get most considera-
tion it is apparently valueless.
The terrible experiences of a settler in
the Northern Territory have just been out-
lined by Robert G. Perreau, of Stanleton,
in a letter published by the Palmerston
Times (M.L.). It appears that Perreau
landed with his wife and seven children at
Darwin 18 months ago in order to take up
a block of 1000 acres. He states that the
land is splendid, that it will grow anything
and that he consequently has no excuse for
not working it. His main trouble is, how-
ever, that the Government advanced fencing
material and sufficient building material to
build a good large house, outbuildings and
cow sheds; also 18 milking cows, 50 goats,
three good horses, seven pigs and farm imple-
ments. Instead of dying so that he could
come away from the place, they all insist on
doing remarkably well. Also, instead of
the climate playing havoc with the children,
they absolutely refuse to be sick, and insist
on wearing out clothes and eating large
meals.. The embittered Perreau, in report-
ing this sequence of calamities, suggests that
other Maorilanders should pack up and get
away to the North and the sunshine, and put
up with the same misfortunes. Tiie
Bulletin can only suggest that if, after
inquiry by a .Royal Commission, it is found
that settlers in the Territory are staggering
under such intolerable hardships, the whole
thing should.be exposed and the climatic and
other conditions declared unconstitutional.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Harrison 0.” : My “Poverty Point” com-
ments on “The Fight,” the first production
ot the “Australian National Theatre,” at
Oakleigh (Melb.), have moved J. A. David-
the founder of the theatre, to inquire
(B. 16/9/T5) : “Why should ‘Harrison O.’
ignore the fact that the play deals with
syphilis?” I didn’t “ignore” it —I didn’t
know it. True, some of the speeches seemed
inapplicable to a consumptive, but the fact
that the young man had syphilis was never
mentioned even in the most guarded manner,
ihe writer journeyed back from Oakleigh
with a well-known Bulletin versifier, an
equally well-known black-and-white artist,
and a daily pressman—all hardened play-
goers. The question as to what really was
the matter with the lad who was made the
butt of the doctor’s long-winded orations
was raised; but it was quickly agreed that
there was no reason for supposing that he
had anything other than consumption. Mr.
Davidson now lets us into the secret that the
youth had consumption and syphilis, and
that it was on account of the latter that the
girl to whom he was engaged threw him over.
This last was not even adumbrated. I
gathered, as did others, that the young man
was dropped because the heroine learned of
the shabby manner in which he had jilted a
former sweetheart. “Does the moral have
to be pointed with an axe?” asks Mr. David-
son. No; and there is no reason either why
it should be chopped off with an axe and
buried in Mr. Davidson’s back-yard. If the
man had syphilis why not sav so?
Why present him with consumption in addi-
tion?. Why, if the play “deals with syphi-
lis, is the disease not once mentioned—not
even by some innocuous daily-newspaper
euphuism such as the “red plague”? If the
heroine broke with her fiance because he had
syphilis, why drag in the unnecessary yarn
of the broken-hearted former sweetheart
whom he had jilted? Really, if Ibsen had
written “Ghosts” on similar lines the world
might now be wondering whether Oswald
Alving s troubles was measles or ingrowing
toenails.
“MARY LATIMER—NUN,” AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS’S.
The bad father was so bad that the artist
thought he saw this picture of the audience
after the show.
The latest enterprise of the Branscombe
Proprietary is a Garden Theatre overlooking
Rushcutter’s Bay, Sydney. Cost of con-
struction, £12,000; object, profit from open-
air entertainment. The amphitheatre will
seat 1700 spectators, and the audiences at
the opening of the show early next month
will be entertained with what Branscombe
calls “drawing-room vaudeville” by the
Violet Dandies —the finest, he avers, of all
the “Dandy” cos. that have made good in
Australia and Maoriland.
“Jwosp”: Australian Aggie Thorn didn’t
have to wait long for a job in the Land of
the Proud. The little woman, clearing out
from her bad luck, went over with Fred
Niblo and his wife, and straight away was
roped in by John Oort for a leading part in
“The Princess Pat,” a new Victor Herbert
comic opera.
Philip Lytton, Ltd., the dramatic caterers
for country shows in N.S.W. and Queens-
land, think they have a sure winner in
Henry Fletcher’s “The Waybacks,” which
they are bringing to Sydney Palace next
month. In an abbreviated and untitivated
form it has been tried out at Wagga and
sundry other centres of Cocky interest, and
the box-office results were so good that
everybody concerned has strong hopes of
being able to apply for a million or two of
the next war loan.
“Norbell”: Poverty Point in Brisbane is
feeling the stress of the times. One con-
tinuous picture-house has pulled down the
blind, and some of the others are sending out
S.O.S. signals. I went to hear Wallace
Brownlow sing at a suburban hall the other
night. He was well supported, but a fune-
real gloom was on the proceedings, and after
the one-time matindc hero, who was in fine
voice, had sung one song as a guarantee of
good faith, it was announced that their
money would be returned at the doors to
those patrons who desired it.
m- Boy”: Guy Innes, news editor of
Melbourne Hekald, has collaborated with
-bred. Hall, who used to pilot Rickards’s
orchestra _ through the shoals of ragtime, in
a patriotic song, “When Australia’s Roys
Come Home.” Innes is an old-established
Bulletin bard, and is responsible for a
large share of.“ Under the Clocks,” the frivo-
lous column in the Herald which during
the last couple of years has been making the
Argus’s “Passing Show” look so sick. He
could write in a more lofty strain than the
pre-arranged title of the ditty warranted,
but it is doubtful if he could perpetrate any-
thing more likely to fill a long-felt want at
patriotic concerts and suburban “evenings.”
“8.J.”: George Dawe, who has been
both hero and villain for Bilanderson, has
gone into camp at Seymour. That he is not
lacking in nerve was shown when, in com-
pany with Dorothy Grimston and Harry
Hill, he attempted to establish an entente
cordiale between patrons of the Tivoli and
Bernard Shaw, by presenting “How He Lied
to Her Husband.” True, it was a failure ;
but the fault was Shaw’s, not Dawc’s.
“0.K.” on Wagner for concert purposes:
In the recent orchestral concert at Melbourne
Auditorium the orchestra was put into the shade by
Gocssens, the Belgian baritone. Goossens is a drama-
tic artist, having a sufficiently big voice, full charged
with natural melody and passion. He neither under-
states the case nor piles on the agony. It happened
that his brilliant turn was followed by the orchestra’s
prelude and closing scene of Wagner’s “Tristan and
Isolde.” This had no dramatic meaning whatever.
It was just a gloomy, boresome waste of trouble. Of
course, the synopsis on the programme spoke of the
“marvellous tone-color of this heart-rending scene,”
but it really carried no more persuasive force than
any of the other dirgey Wagnerian numbers—instance
“MARY LATIMER — NUN,” AT MEL
BOURNE
PRINCESS'S.
The disgraceful lord.
Canon Hill.
Wotan’s long-winded orations—which are occasionally
uttered from the concert platform. Terribly dull bits
of Wagner are imagined by cranks to contain in
tbeir orchestration all the essential harmony which is
achieved in the combination of music, song, dramatic
action and pictorial effect on the stage, whereas these
sombre bits, when torn from their operatic setting, are
equally vague and heavy. Why will musicians—some
of them—persist in claiming impossible power of ex-
pression for Wagner’s music on its own? Melancholy
horn notes and solemn bars of silence may be all right
in their place, which is grand opera. The same re-
mark applies to long stretches of undulating dirge.
But there is very little “tone color’’ in anything
of Wagner’s except the bits that suggest going to
church, or Sunday evening at home with prayers
before bedtime. And if the color were audible the
tints would not be charming. Wagner wrote the
gloomiest of operas for the stage with a merciless
regard for the tout ensemble. He didn’t write music
for the concert platform. Some scenes in his operas
leave a mental impression which is abiding, and the
work as a whole leaves one with a headache which
is transitory. But in his music, heard apart from
the opera, there is no abiding charm. When a really
soulful person like myself has heard the overture to
“Tannhauser” played 50 times he gets to hate it.
It doesn’t bear being hackneyed, like an old Verdi
melody.
‘‘H.O.” ; What is the matter with “Fair”
(B. 16/9/’l5) ? My sniff at some Yankee
plays—“ Bought and Paid For,” “The Law
of the Land” and “Potash and Perlmutter”
—-have inspired him to mention in a trium-
phant tone of ink that the authors of these
mistakes —Klein (fine old English name!),
Broadhurst and Montague Glass —were born
in England. Of course they were; but this
makes them no less Yankee dramatists than
A. L. Gordon, who was not born in Aus-
tralia, was an Australian poet. The three
plays mentioned were written around Yankee
characters, in an Amurkan setting, for
United Shakes consumption in the first
place, and the tail of the star-spangled eagle
is over them all.
“Billy Blue”: The first theatre in N. S.
Wales outside Sydney was built at Emu
Plains in 1830. The Sydney Gazette an-
nounced that the new building “was opened
with the comedy ‘John Bull’ and the melo-
drama ‘Rob Roy,’ performed in a manner
reflecting great credit on the different indi-
viduals composing the dramatis personae.”
The bills announced “John Bull” and the
“Lying Valet,” but in compliance with the
request of several ladies the latter was
abandoned. The old-time reporter announced
that “amongst the highly respectable audi-
ence of upwards of 200,” he noticed “nearly
40 ladies and gentlemen”—and he proceeded
to mention the 40 sheep, so pointedly dis-
tinguished from the eight score goats.
“De Oriel”: He took a keen interest in
the Melbourne show, and the ventriloquist’s
doll caused him huge merriment. After the
twenty-fifth laugh a worried look spread
over his whiskers. “Why. this is a fake,”
he snorted. “The doll isn’t talking at all!
It’s only a dummy.” I think he came
from Sydney.
“Eryander” : That “save” of Dan Barry’s
(B. 9/9/T5l reminds me. It was at a Milan
theatre. _ The leading lady, having quar-
relled with her bosom friend, was putting
aside, for return, every present she had
received from the person, when a filmy
petti _ carried away at the halliards and
deposited itself in a graceful circle around
the lady’s ankles. The house gasped, but
not the lady. Calmly stepping out of the
nebulosity, she lifted it, folded it, and de-
liberately placed it with the other articles.
‘‘Another of the cat’s presents,” she said.
“I’m glad it reminded me of its existence!”
Then the roof had hard work to stay on.
(Continued on page SJp)
The latest howl in Sydney about prefer-
ence is from the Shop Assistants’ Union,
which complains that Chief Secretary Black
employs non-unionist hands in the State
fish-shops. The union, of course, may not
include any retail fish-sellers, and Black
would be justified in refusing to put a
draper’s assistant on to the job lest he
might, in a moment of forgetfulness, sell
the State’s fish by the yard. Still it is a
public misfortune that the union which
talks least about strike is most liable to be
overlooked. Little points of preference are
never forgotten when militant unions like
the Wharf Laborers, or the Seamen, or the
Railway Workers are concerned.
Europe is not buying jewels just at
present, thank you ; nor is it able to suggest
any time when the man might call again.
So the Queensland gem trade has gone to
live in Queer-street, attempts to open a
market in America having failed. The
pearl-shell industry has also been knocked
endways, and there was a case in the courts
the other day affecting it. Burns, Philp and
Co. had advanced large sums-to various con-
signors of pearl-shell on the security of the
cargoes they had forwarded; and the firm,
tired of waiting for the consignors to realise,
wanted its cash. The Equity Court, how-
ever, decided that the co. could not recover
its advances by a sale of the shell, but it
could sell sufficient to reimburse itself for all
reasonable incidental expenses for freight,
storage, etc., if the amount was not paid
within 14 days. If it isn’t paid it looks as
if someone who doesn’t mind waiting for
something to turn up will be able to get
something worth keeping.
“Hamer”: The announcement that an
Anglo-French loan of a “billion dollars” is
to be floated in America revives an old argu-
ment. According to the rules of arithmeti-
cal progression a billion is 1,000,000,000,000
—a million millions—minor denominations
being easily described as a hundred millions,
a thousand millions and a hundred thousand
millions. But the U.S.A. have made
a thousand millions a billion for the
same reason that they make a place of two
stores and a saloon a city—the feverish desire
to let little things appear big. It is about
time the meaning of the billion was settled,
anyway. In the next war, when 9724 million
troops are in the field, and credits to the
extent of £17.650.000,000,351 are passed to
pay the preliminary expenses, it will be
handy to know how to say the figures so
that the next fool, will be able to understand
you. And meantime billions are convenient
things in which to measure the distances to
various stars and the propinquity of a politi-
cian to his platform.
From The Bulletin’s old contributor
“Jobber,” at present nursing a wound in
Mena House Hospital, Egypt:—
Re successful opportunists (B. 24/6/’l5). I’d like
to parade a few for inspection. There’s the man who
manages to keep well away from the firing line, and
never touches a rifle. He has been known to buy,
from sailors, luxuries like condensed milk, chocolate,
etc., at a ridiculous price. There may be nothing
wrong with that. But isn’t there something wrong
when he retails his purchases to the men behind the
guns at a profit of anything up to SOO per cent.?
There’s an object in khaki not more than a million
miles away from the Front who was caught at that
game, and I’m glad to say he promptly had the
kybosh put on him. I’d like to parade, too, the
rotter who took 80 “disasters” (the best part of an
Australian “quid”) out of a purse he sneaked from
under the pillow of a badly-wounded soldier. Aren’t
these pretty close to the limit ? Oh, no, they’re not
all glorious things that our chaps do, and don’t you
in Australia do us the bad service of lifting us on a
high pedestal and putting a halo round us. The
higher you put us the worse we’ll bump when you
find that we’re not a bit better than we were when we
left.
FALSE PRETENCES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve been to see a show again.
Why did I do this foolish thing?
It brought remorse and bitter pain—
Regret for cash that’s taken wing.
But in the daily ads. they say
There never was so great a play.
I went to see, in point of fact,
“A work of genius, every act!”
I sat it out, and every scene
A fresh infliction was to me;
The plot was thin, the talk was mean,
And on the whole it seemed to be
A musical debauch; likewise
The wit would make your gorge to rise—
Fit pabulum for people who
Make faces through a fence at Kew.
If baker’s bread is not just what
The baker’s man pretends it is,
They fine the seller. Like a shot
They’re down upon the butcher’s biz
If all his meat is “tripe.” We crush
The dairyman who’s milk is slush.
Let’s make these showmen keep the pact
And edict of the Pure Foods Act!

“Bad Australian” rolls it along behind the
Taffies who have come to congest the
Northern Territory :
Years ago the Government of this country (Argen-
tine) persuaded some Welshmen that it was the finest
place in the world for the propagation of leeks and
eisteddfods; and when the men of Harlech marched
in it dumped them down at Chubut or scattered
them promiscuously over the face of the country
where the Patagonians come from. What a country
it is! The blizzard works overtime seven days a
week ; the natives hide behind their whiskers; the
goat and the ox wear their wool reversed through
wandering about with their backs hunched up against
the gale. The sheep and the wheat and the oats are
generally blown out by the roots, and every family
holds the mortgage down flat with a weight in the
middle in case capital should fly out of the country.
Well, the Welshmen fought the good fight against
Nature and banditos who often had the tacit approval
of the sergeant of police. But the Government didn't
keep as closely to its covenant as Caradoc ap Ewan
had a right to expect; so when the “Australia agent’
(vide the local press) appeared among the descend-
ants of the Druidical priests He found the time ripe
for his “nefarious proper ganda’’ (also vide the local
press) and managed to work up an exodus. There-
fore it was that lately some fine colonising material
swung out from Puerto Madriga for Australia. They
are good stuff these people. But don't make them
n.ny promises that are not to be carried out to the
letter. Give them a fair deal and more Llewellyn
and Rhys will follow. Meanwhile the local press is
as wild as a Turk, and if the man with the proper
ganda puts his face round the Horn again his- pelt
will decorate the front door of the Casa Rosada.

A job for George Black: —
This is purely a man’s point of view, but it should
be worth the consideration of the weaker (-ankled)
sex. It is nearly 10 years since that Yankee abomi-
nation, the “Cuban” heel, first made its disastrous
presence known to Australia, and during that period
it has been responsible for more physical anguish,
deformity and discomfort than anything worn by the
sex since the mediaeval girdle of chastity—which, by
the bye, was the cause of the old saying, “Love
laughs at locksmiths.” And now we have the super-
Cuban heel, and every flapper, flapperette and flap-
perina goes up and down not, like Agag, treading
delicately, but bobbing, yawing, reeling and stagger-
ing like small boats in a big sea. And their ankles!
Seven out of every ten of our girls and women have
got weak, deformed or turned-in ankles—and some
haven’t got any visible ankles at all! Of these latter
there are two kinds—the “broomstick” and the “Mul-
lingar heifer” understanding, leg or extremity. The
former has no calf worth mentioning; the latter has
a calf which begins under the knee and ends at the
heel. If girls of 17 or 18 suffer from weak ankles,
how will they feel (and look) when they become
mothers ? Imagine men abandoning their immemorial
common-sense heels for a spindly, wobblesome, foot-
sprainin'g, pointed monstrosity which tilts the un-
happy wearer forward and (as doctors know) has a
most serious effect upon the legs, the spine and the
lower internal organs. Who will help me form the
Women’s Low-Heel League, and advocate a duty of
1-200 per cent, on Yankee boot and shce abortions?
Dic-k (Noel) Wells, one-time well-known
mining man of Australia, was a sergeant at
the Dardanelles until last week lie fell into
the casualty list for the second time. While
training with the Australian army in Egypt
lie got a hint as to the probable procedure of
Moses when striking the rock. Wells was
much exercised as to the origin of the vast
quantities of silicified wood in the Libyan
desert. The “overflow of the Nile” theory
was not acceptable to him, since Nile waters
do not bear sufficient silica in solution to con-
vert old forests into compact chalcedony.
A BIG DROUGHT.
OOTBACK KID (to small brother who has dropped his penny through the jetty): “It's no
good howlin’, I tell yer-yer won’t get it back now till the bloomin’ dam dries
up:”
While supervising the erection of targets on
a rise in the desert, surrounded by flat rock,
stepping down in almost unnoticeable ter-
races for a radius of half a mile, centred by
broken mounds of cellular siliceous mineral,
he suspected an extinct geyser. After locat-
ing several more, he advised Sir Wm. Oakes,
managing director of the Heliopolis Tram-
way Co., to put down a bore at one of them.
At 300 ft. the co. has struck good water. Moses
got the water at surface; but that was 5000
years ago, and probably at that period the
vent of the geyser tapped by the great law-
giver was only beginning to choke, and Moses
had only to crack the siliceous sinter to set
her spouting again.

Hr. Cuscaden, about the only man in the
Melbourne City Council with any knowledge
of the science of public health, was quietly
turned down the other day. Referring to
the increase of infant mortality in the city,
Cuscaden said that' it was directly traceable
to impure milk. “The present method of
handling milk was appalling. .. .The whole
supply of Melbourne should be under muni-
cipal control.” The Council proceeded with
the next business. But when Attorney-
General Mackinnon asked the city to permit
fruit and fish hawkers to continue to trade
in Queen-street, the Council, which can see
only the shopkeeper who pays the swollen
rent and passes it on to the consumer, de-
cided on a war of extermination. The citi-
zen who can’t afford to buy fish and bananas
at the price of ice in Tophet' doesn’t count;
and the murdering of infants with bad milk
is a vested interest.

The lady with a morbid imagination is no
modern development. Adelaide Register dis-
inters, in its 50-years-ago column, the official
report of the Inspector of Railways in 1865:
“Gentlemen passengers, as well as railway
officers of all classes, constantly refuse to
travel singly with a stranger of the weaker
sex, under the belief that it is only common
prudence to avoid in this manner all risk of
being accused, for purposes of extortion, of
insult or assault.” The “weaker sex”—from
which the Unprotected Male had to flee in
“common prudence” !
“Tibs”; The daily papers make it plain
that the movement lias been carefully thought
out. The Bear will fight stubbornly back to
the Ural mountains, luring Von Ilindenburg
into Siberia. Then they will lure him on
with terrific Josses amid a hurricane of shells
to Tomsk, dispute the passage of the Yenesi
and heavily repulse him on the banks of the
Lena. Still maintaining an unbroken front
before the decimated Prussian Guard, the
Bear will entice him on to Vladivostoek
Then it will have him where it wanted him
The Slavonic hordes will pour themselves
across Canada and the United States, take
ship at N. Yark, and suddenly reinforce the
armies of Joffre and French. Just as spring
is beginning to clothe the landscape in a
mantle of green they will, with a mighty
shout, leap on the enemy from the rear and
sideways and settle the situation once and
for all. And then we shall know for certain
that the daily papers were right all along
when they gave us darkly to understand that
the Russians’ retreat was a deep laid scheme.
The Maoris continue to enlist to fill the
broken ranks of their countrymen at Galli-
poli. Most of the big North Island tribes
have been sending in their quotas of young
men steadily, and these are being trained
near Auckland. But there are some parts of
the Island where the feeling against the
pakeha still rankles, and several tribes have
thusfar stood out of the recruiting, though
most of them are said to be-wavering now.
The next lot to go to the Front will leave
from Wellington, and it has been arranged
that before they sail they are to be shut up
in the local Town Hall with their most
famous chiefs, who will tell the youngsters
a few things that it will be good for them
who go to Egypt to know.
When the bottom dropped out of the Tas-
mania gold mine at Beaconsfield (Tas.)
one of the things left behind was a line set
of brick and concrete buildings which cost
over £20,000 and could be bought now for
£2OOO. The State Government is turning
over the idea of changing them into a
munitions factory in the hope that if it
starts one and runs it during the war the
Federal Government will take it over when
the row is only a bad memory ana a long
bill. There are forges, steam hammers and
other odds and ends on the premises, and
floor space for over 100 lathes, while there
are enough empty houses in Beaconsfield to
shelter a few thousand munition workers.
Away back in the ’7o’s an attempt was
made to work the mountains of iron ore
near Beaconsfield, but the stuff didn t
answer with the methods used in those
days, though the Bessemer process might
possibly make first-class metal out of it.

•‘Clnulah” : There was a Festival at Mel-
bourne Exhibition last week, to help build a
new synagogue —at Carlton. The Jewry is
divided in opinion about this. Hebrews love
to coneentrate, even more than R.C.’s; hence
there is usually resistance to any new syna-
gogue. The first in Melbourne was built in
Bourke-street west, and is now very much
(»ut of the way. The second resulted from a
split among Melbourne Jews, engineered by
Rabbi Itintel, and was the cause of much
bitterness. The division was between the
English and foreign Hebrews. Itintel suc-
ceeded in establishing the fine East Mel-
bourne Synagogue, now under Lenzer, a
Russian, who arrived as singer. I have been
told that he was an operatic basso. He had
to learn English here. There is perfect har-
mony nowadays between West and East;
also with St. Kilda Synagogue, under Dang-
low. The Carlton tabernacle, yet in a small
way, has for its pastor Chodowski, who came
hither from Maoriland.

"Mujik”: When the Australian kid comes
running home on Sunday with a decorative
card bearing a pious legend, the odds are
IUO to 1 that the thing also carries a micro-
scopic brand —“Made in Germany.” Thou-
sands of these things are given away in
Australia every week by meek curates and
blameless rectors. Last Sunday, while I
was reading the report of the Bryce Com-
mission on atrocities committed in Belgium,
the horrific story of murder, arson and rape
was interrupted by a demand to admire a
piece of flamboyant typographical art on
which, surrounded by a garland of roses
were the words, ‘‘Suffer the Little Children

“I 1 .II.” : lie was a very large, heavy per-
son, with a pair of hands like hams. The
bunch was discussing the war-census and
alternative occupations. The heavy one ex-
plained, in response to a suggestion, that lie
couldn't dig—hadn’t been used to it. Didn’t
know that he could do anything else, either.
“Well,” said somebody, “they’ll give you a
shovel, all right.” Somebody else mentioned
cooking as a suitable job for a beavv citizen
who couldn’t dig. The large man’s eyes
lighted up, and he licked his chops slowly.
“M-yes,” he. murmured, “I hadn’t thought; of
that. Cooking, of course.” And “cook” it
was, on the card.
“Moana” : It hap-

night leave had spent

they fell off the last
train they were all,
except one, able to
walk steadily past
the guard. The ex-
ception was helpless.
He was unable to
stand, let alone walk.
11 is mates were be-
ginning to despair
when the genius' of
the party suggested
taking off one of the
victim’s boots and binding up his foot with
several handkerchiefs. This was done, and
he was carried triumphantly past as a case
of badly-sprained ankle.

In the course of an address to a country
branch of lied Cross workers in Victoria,
Dr. Edith Barrett stressed the necessity for
greater effort and cited a cable from Adrian
Knox, in Egypt, stating that “owing to the
heavy demand from Lemnos all stocks were
exhausted.” She said she had replied to
this that a further 2000 cases had been
despatched. The local paper broke the
news next day : “Heavy demand for lemons ;
all stocks exhausted ; 2000 cases sent”—and
tlm Red Cross people sank beneath the
avalanche of fruit which rolled in for days
alter. When at last they fought their way
out they set to and loaded a waggon for the
Melbourne military hospitals.

Motto for sudden and spasmodic patriots:

The idea that all the scientific knowledge

only outside the Vaderland. Inside, they
know that P. Enterprise has been at work
with his old thoroughness. When war broke

About 978 inventors have lately taken out
patents for life-protecting devices to be used
by soldiers. These range from things that
are picks and shovels by day and handy
covers for the heart by night, to others that
are egg-boilers in the morning, shaving sets
at lunch and skull-protectors in the even-
ing. One man has devised a combined blot-
ting-pad and armored shirt. But if the sur-
geons’ reports are worth anything all this
vast amount of inventive genius had been
better employed in designing an instrument
for recovery of the national p.n. The mod-
ern bullet is the most irresponsible, capri-
cious affair on earth. The old bullet just
went in “plunk,” and generally stayed there
until the recipient died or a surgeon fished it
nut and filled lip the orifice with a strip of
blanket. But the long, thin, nickel-plated
affair that comes Whining along nowadays
like a locust behaves in the manner of an
intoxicated riddle. When it wants to take
a man in the heart it enters by the left toe,
skirts the ankle, and taking a running jump
from the calf to the thigh, avoids the knee,
then climbs up the femoral artery, nips
over the appendice, and grabbing the dia-
phragm leaps nimbly into the left ventricle.
Or it gets in on the elbow, comes out seek-
ing re-entry through the fifth rib. and bolts
away into vacancy from the left ear, with-
out doing discoverable injury. In these
cases the soldier is generally given a day off
to play cricket. There is a man hack in
Sydney with a bullet-hole in him but no
bullet-hole out of him. yet no bullet can be
found in him ; another lmd a bullet from east
to west across where his bully-beef went to.
Therefore, in view of the undisciplined char-
acter of the modern bullet, it seems as if the
best protection against it is to get hold of the
other fellow l>y the slack of his pants and
rub his nose in the mud before he has time
to fire nis gun.

a proper climax to the

be a census of ideas and

MR. T. M. MALONE, J.P.,
RETIRED WORLD’S CHAMPION ALL-
ROUND ATHLETE,
praises Ilean’s Essence, the great, money-
saving remedy for Coughs. Colds and Throat
Troubles. He recently wrote : “I had trouble
with my throat of a most painful and chok-
ing kind. It was so bad at times that I
could hardly articulate, and I could not
speak above a whisper. I found a friend in
Mr. Allen Doone, who persuaded me to try
a course of Mean’s Essence. The effect was
almost incredible. Within three days all the
trouble was cleared away. I can also certify,
through having witnessed its speedy effect in
several instances, that Mean’s Essence is
a boon and a blessing in cases of
colds and sore throats among chil-
dren of tender years. In my opinion no home
should be without this economical means for
the preparation of an excellent family cough
mixture. Head’s Essence is such a wonder-
fully good remedy that it should be kept in
every home. It is so economical that a bottle
costing 2s. goes as far as 12s. worth of ordi-
nary cough mixtures. If you cannot obtain
Head’s Essence from your chemist or store-
keeper send 2s. (adding 3d. for postage),
and you will receive a bottle per return mail
from the manufacturer, G. W. Mean,
chemist, ITS Castlereagh Street. Sydney; or
Mean’s Pharmacy, Wanganui, New Zealand.*

HANNAN, M.H.R. the
elect of Fawkner (Vic.).
A man who took a hand in the destruc-
tion of the Emden went under recently at
the Dardanelles. This was Private W. C.
Falconer, of the first Maoriland expedition-
ary force. He was a telegraphist in the
Eltliam post office, and much interested in
wireless. Aboard the transport he was set
to handle the spark, and while on “listening”
duty had plenty of opportunities to experi-
ment with a detector of his own contrivance.
It was while using this device that he picked
up the hurried call sent out by Cocos Island.
Of all the wireless “listeners” in the big-
fleet he was the only man who caught the
cry. and he probably wouldn’t have got it
with anything but his own receiver.
I’asseil out the other day, near Pitt Town
(N.S.W.), “Tommy” Thompson. “Tommy”
started as a mail carrier when he was about
nine, and stuck to it for just on 70 years.
But general elections were his specialty.
Dead and gone William Morgan never had
a more strenuous supporter. He helped
Morgan to beat Sydney Burdekin for the
Hawkesbury, though Burdekin out of Par-
liament was worth a dozen Morgans in it
when it came to log-rolling and wire-pulling.
At last Hall beat Morgan, and lie has kept
the seat for 15 or 16 years, though he has
scarcely spoken in the House all that time.
In one respect Hall is like George Reid—
he can sleep anywhere and in any position.
A large ability to go to sleep counts for a
lot in old Windsor and other Hawkesbury
townships.
“THE NURSES ARE RUTTING IN
SPLENDID WORK.”
(From the Other Girls’ Point of View.)
Alfred La Nauze, who died lately at Arma-
dale (Vic.), aged 73, was for many years
chief magistrate in Mauritius. One of his
sons, Charles, was killed at the Dardanelles
iu June; another, George, is that member of
the Eastern Telegraph Co.’s staff who sent
from Cocos the wireless message that brought
the Sydney along to meet the Emden.
Ex-Justice Simpson, just dead, had his
political ambitions in the days of long ago,
and started out once after a seat in the
N. S. Vales Assembly. But he fell off his
horse and went to bed in a hospital instead.
He never tried again, but put in several
years in the Council.
Estell, of Mines and Labor, is the present
sick man of the N.S.W. Ministry. A facial
trouble which called for the knife a year or
two ago became troublesome again lately.
The operation has been successful, but the
little man has been allowing his politics to
worry him far too much.
The row in the Tasmanian Public Health
Department is likely to send a billet begging
at a time when doctors are scarce. The
Board appointed to hold the' usual inquiry
has not yet reported, but according to his
friends McClintock has had enough, any-
how. Elkington, now in Queensland, the
original occupant of the post of Chief Health
Officer, was the only one who found the job
tolerable. But, in his way, Elkington was
an artist. If he wanted to shake up a local
board of health he first got a beautiful set
of photographs, taken by his unobtrusive
lieutenant Wadsworth, depicting the pigs
browsing about the chairman’s slaughter-
house, with the cesspit close handy. “If you
don’t, I’ll expose you,” was the formula for
Ids best prescription. Elkington worked on
the principles of painless dentistry.
Jolin Deason, just dead at Moliaaul
(Vic.), aged 85, was the discoverer, with
Richard Oates, of the famous “Welcome
Stranger” nugget, near Dunolly, in 1569.
This little speck weighed in the rough
2801 b., and Was worth £9555.
C. .T. Valentine, dead in Adelaide at SO.
was the type of man who can do just one
thing and does that perfectly. lie came
from England in the old gold-digging days,
but took to the pastoral life almost at once,
and iu 1865 became Chief Inspector of Stock,
during the great drought of that era. In
that position he stayed till retired under the
age-limit 10 years ago. Valentine was a
mine of information on all points connected
with stations or stock, and transparently
honest in everything.
Passed over in his 90th year,
Nicholas Maine, one of the most
energetic of Melbourne’s early
citizens. His days on earth
included time spent in a mer-
chant’s office in Belfast (Ire-
land). in voyages to Brazil as
supercargo, in running a Pata-
gonian guano fleet, in adven-
tures in various South Ameri-
can republics, and in opening
up trade between Brazil and
Russia. After that he was a
stockbroker in Liverpool; then
he went to California : and next,
after a spell in Mexico and
Nicaragua, he naturally rushed
to the Victorian diggings. More
or less settling down, he tried
station life in Queensland, but
not liking it returned to Mel-
bourne, and there applied for
the local secretaryship of the
A.M.P. Society, which he se-
cured in 1868. Hardly any-
body thought the rolling stone
would fit; but it did, and he
continued in the billet for 28
years, his only holiday being-
one trip to England in the early
’9()’s. He married a daughter
of Andrew McCrae. an old-time
warden of flic Victorian gold-
fields.
Alban Gee, manager of the
one co. in Australia which does
best for its shareholders when it
doesn’t make any profits, shifted
into Sydney the other day from
Auburn; and, as he had made
Auburn, the neighborhood fed
him and obliged him to talk.
Gee was only 19 when he was
brought in with the late Wm.
Cordingley by the Australian
Meat Co. That was in 1866.
Gee was the meat packer;
Cordingley the chemist. The
thing was a failure; and, after
a while the youngster Gee set to
work to establish the Sydney
Meat Preserving Co., on a really
brilliant basis, and he has run
it for 44 years—run it so suc-
cessfully that it has never paid a dividend
and hopes it never will. The anomaly is
explained by the fact that it is owned by
squatters, and buys only when prices are
weak. It is always in the market, and its
bidding makes the other purchasers bid
higher. So it goes on bidding till there is
no profit in the purchase; and that is why
it succeeds by always failing to pay a divi-
dend.
It is claimed by her relatives that Mrs.
Letitia Woodward, who died at Toorak
( Vic.) last week, was the oldest living Aus-
tralian-born white woman. She was a
daughter of Colonel Chas. Wall, who arrived
with his regiment (3rd Buffs) at Sydney in
the early ’twenties. The daughter was
born in the Wynyanl Square Barracks on
September 4, 1824, which would make her
91.

(N.S.W.). The only other living explorer of
his time is Bigjohn Forrest. Tietkens was
the second in command of Ernest Giles’s
last two trips through the West —the first in
1873, the second a few years later.
There was one less survivor of the old-
time Indian Mutiny when James Bell
answered the last roll-call at Hobart the
other day. He saw some hot times as a
private in the Seaforth Highlanders, and at
the end pleaded guilty to 78.
John McCall, long the Agent-General for
Tasmania, has joined the A.A.M.C. The
foundations of Major McCall’s career were
laid in the fertile Tasmanian nor’-west,
where the farmer usually has enough money
to pay the doctor, and, if the matter were
left to him, would always keep a Conserva-
tive representative in Parliament. The
Agent-Generalship with the tag of knight-
hood seemed to mark the close of McCall’s
public existence, but the war has given him
a chance to do something worth while in
another direction.

L. Ilalloran, who went off with the Light
Horse from Sydney, was wounded on Aug-
ust 14, and died apparently about three
weeks later. Before leaving he got his
bread as a linesman on a Sydney paper,
where he put up a good fight to secure better
treatment for the semi-detached staff-men
who w r ere on the same mark ; and he but-
tered the bread with occasional Bulletin
verse and more frequent prose. After
enlisting lie kept up the family reputation
of the Hallorans by turning out for the Sun
much descriptive stuff which often was a
good deal like literature.

Aburiri (ALL.), has all of them, with extra
bars for the gold and silver, and five certi-

REHABILITATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Professor Stephen Langdon, M.A., Tt.IL, Ph.D., of
Oxford University, has just translated a Sumerian
tablet showing that Noah and not Adam was ap-
pointed Chief Gardener in Eden, and ate of the for-
bidden fruit. —London Times.
Again, again! The hand iconoclastic
Beats down an ancient record in the dust,
And scoffers gibe iu bitter tone sarcastic,
And ask what ancient tale can mortals trust.
This time the fame is cleared of Father Adam
Who lived in Eden with his charming madam.
llow long- has he been blamed! But lo ! to-day
No stain is left on Adam’s reputation,
For fresh discoveries clear the blot away,
And show, in clearest light of revelation,
That neither he nor Eve, our primal mother,
Transgressed about that fruit, or any other.
The Villain in the piece, we learn at last,
Was that old vinous sailor, Father Noah —-
The same Who built an Ark and tethered fast
Within its timbers crocodile and boa ;
It seems that, not content with shameless tippling,
And so corrupting- Ilam, a gentle stripling,
Before the Ark was built or set afloat
To save our race for annals dark and sinful
(From quaint Sumerian tablets do 1 quote),
That mariner consumed a tidy skinful
Of fruits forbid in Eden’s blooming garden—
A sin for which he never craved a pardon ;
But cast the blame (the cunning, crafty knave!)
To rest for aye on Adam's guiltless shoulders,
While he, the culprit, rested in the grave
Along- with other early racial moulders,
And left the grand old Gardener for a guerdon
The carrying of the Skipper's trespass-burden.
And as to Satan —grossly slandered, too—
lias he been wronged about the apple-stealing?
Is it a fact, to give the De’il his due,
He nourished no ungentlemanly feeling,
And, though his antecedents were but shady,
Took no advantage of an honest lady?
A plague upon that low-down Hebrew scribe!
lie must have been a scurvy sort of vandal
Who first traduced with solemn sneer and gibe
That primal pair, and blackened them with scandal.
Perchance he, too, for love of pure variety,
Invented Noah’s lapse in inebriety!
lie, too, no doubt, or someone of his breed,
Begat the yarn how Jonah went a-whaling,
And told in fine imaginative screed
How she-bears ate the children for their railing;
lie was the fountain-head of Olden Mystery,
And wrote the bulk of all “authentic” history.

The disclosed profits are insufficient to pay
the dividend; and that is a most unusual
position for the Union to be in. Judging
by the general policy of the management
one can feel quite sure that the deficit was
only produced by extraordinary demands
upon the ordinary profits. A very comfort-
ing remark in the chairman’s speech pro-
bably explains it, or part of it: —
You will not be surprised that as regards our in-
vestments I have again to announce a considerable
reduction in values. At the end of the half-year
there was a comparatively small depreciation/-on the
values at which they stood in our books, and this
was provided for from funds already set aside for
the purpose. On a valuation taken recently
the meeting was held at the end of July,
five months after the accounts closed —
further depreciation was disclosed, but this has also
been fully provided for.
There has been still further depreciation
since then, and values may go still lower as
money gets dearer; and presumably these
shrinkages, too, will be provided for,
notwithstanding that by and bye a
recovery is just about as certain as
anything can be. The Union hetsf,
however, such large internal reserves that
unquestionably much further writing down
can be done without any call on the dis-
closed reserves. For instance, the bank
premises in Australia and Maoriland, worth
certainly well on to a million, stand in the
books at only £384,600. If these were
written up to their true value at least half
a million would be available for writing
down investments without touching the pre-
sent visible reserves. Still it is pretty cer-
tain that things will , have to go a lot worse
with the Allies before any such step as that
is taken, if the other internal reserves are
anything like what people who ought to
know believe them to be. A
And. after all. what the bank calls its
investments are only a comparatively small
part of its assets. Its total figures are made
up this way :
Coin and short-call money . . £6.264,953
Investments (public securities) 2,507,759
Drafts in transit, etc... .. 3,074,614
"Advances . . . . . . 17,440,135
Premises .. .. .. 500,330
Total .. ..£29,787,791
So the “investments” amount to only about
8 p.c. of the total assets. The coin and
drafts, etc., represent another 31 p.c. The
Advances are practically all in Australia ana
Maoriland ; and these depend for their prop-
erty values mainly upon the wool clip and
the harvest. The borrowing boom has no doubt
given city property in particular a fictitious
value, and a good deal of that will be lost.
But there are not many Australian banks
which have not been fully aware of the
frothy conditions that have prevailed, and
they have asked for margins accordingly.
As The Bulletin has pointed out before,
there was a vast difference between the
Australian banking position as it was in the
early ’nineties, when trouble happened, and
as it was when the maniac of Potsdam set a
lighted match to the world. In the ’nineties
the Australian banks were overloaded with
British money, deposited by fidgety people
who didn’t know that one drought doesn’t
mean national ruin, and who would have
said that you were, taking liberties with
their leg if you had told them that a drought
was to a great extent a species of beneficial
fallowing. Australia had their money and
they wanted it back, and that was all about
it. They wouldn’t wait for the extra-fat
harvest that followed the fallowing. In a
good many cases they accepted a lot less
than they were entitled to; and that was
all to the good of Australia. For when it
did recover Australia owned millions which
it would otherwise have had to pay away ;
and it is those millions and others which
have been banking up in Australian insti-
tutions. Ilence, when the maniac committed
his crime, and the world was ablaze, the
banks were stocked with Australian money ;
and of course it was left where it was —
what could Australia Jo ivith it if it had
been stupid enough to withdraw its deposits?
There has consequently been no need to send
out urgent head-office memos to managers
to call in overdrafts; there havA been no
forced realisations, no flinging of properties
on the market to bring what they could.
Hundreds of times Australia has been asked
to groan over the flight of foreign capital.
Foreign capital isn’t an unmixed blessing
no matter liow it is invested ; but invested
in bank deposits it is a curse so far as Aus-
tralia is concerned; and our salvation now
is that we had practically none of it. For
that reason the Union’s deposits were actu-
ally larger at the end of February than they
were when the war broke out; and the
chances are they will go on steadily grow-
ing as we ship our wool and our wheat and
our butter and our metals and our meat, and
turn them into money.

The Bulletin .won’t swear positively to all
the figures ifTcite last two lines. The amount
of tlie dividends is, for example, a matter of
computation. ’Still they oughtn’t to be far
out. The co., having put itself on a sound
basis and seeing excellent prospects, decided
early in 1914 to reconstruct itself, primarily
with a view to an increase of capital. At
that time there were 22,500 8 p.c. fixed
cumulative A pref. shares, 30,000 8 p.c. fixed
cumulative B pref. shares, and 22,500 ordi-
naries. There was at that time no good-
will. On the reconstruction, as dividends
in excess, of 10 p.c. are liable to provoke
envy, hatred and uncharitableness, the
ordinaries got two new for each one old
share. That made 45,000 ordinaries issued
to old shareholders ; and 52,500 were offered
for subscription at par. All have been
taken, but as at June 30 there were 32,195
oil which ss. was still unpaid. The position
at that date was that there was a paid
capital of £141,951, of which, however,
£22.500 was represented by goodwill; but
at the same date, after providing for current
dividends, there were accumulated profits to
take the place of all but £1747 of this paper
asset. Of this accumulated profit £13.132
was taken over from the old co. in accord-
ance with the terms of the agreement.
It is a fine start; and the profit for the
14 months is very fine too. As it stands in
the table it looks in the top class; and
actually it was perhaps better than it looks,
because the -expenses included the whole of
the cost of the reconstruction. Also depre-
ciation appears to have been very liberally
provided for. Thus the cost to the new co.
of plant and rolling stock was £42.508, and
already £5565 of it has been written off.
Of the new money got in during the term
about £15,000 has gone into stock, which is
how valued at £74,591; and of course it is
not possible to any check on that —it
may be or it may be overvalued,
and profits may be affected accordingly. But
you ca’n generally- form some idea of a co.'s
policy in this very important matter of
stocktaking; and one would say pretty posi-
tively that the chances are all in favor of a
conservative valuation here. In spite of the
increase of stock and of factory freehold
and book debts (£49,716) the co. is in a
fairly easy financial position. Besides stock
and book debts, which are semi-liquid, it,had
on June 30 about £7OOO of cash and imme-
diately convertible assets: while its liabili-
ties of all kinds totalled £46.070.

But that needs explanation. When E. 11.
Lascelles, the patriarch of the woolbroking
business of Western Victoria, invited his
clients and friends to come in, he guaranteed
a 7 p.c. dividend for five years, the surplus
profits of one year to go towards repaying
him any money that he might have to hand
over on account of this guarantee in any
other year. The first year he had to put his
hand in his pocket; and this money was
refunded in 1914. In the ■ past year—■
probably the worst the Western district ever
had—he has to dip still deeper. Conse-
quently the deficit (that is, the amount of
capital represented by goodwill and flota-
tion exes.) is less than the figures shown in
the table. But it seems just as well to let
it stand as it appears above, because in
subsequent years, unless things go utterly
to pieces, the co. will have to refund the
money now paid (or advanced, if you like)
by the vendor. On the other hand, there
may be a trifle to add to goodwill on account
of an item, “Shares motor business, £5000,”
which stands as an asset. It is highly pro-
bable that some of that is not represented
by tangible assets. This motor business, by
the way, has not been a success during the
last couple of- years, and an antici-
pated loss of £l4OB has been oro-
vided for by this co. Fortunately 1914
was a fair year, so that, in spite of the
drought and the motor-business loss, the
vendor is now tapped for only £ll6l. How-
ever, though disappointed, he probably isn’t
regarding it as gone for ever. During the
six years preceding the birth of the co. the
average annual profit was certified to have
been £13,198: and even if the next two
years are £2500 worse than the average, his
money will come back to him.
During the five years no dividend in
excess of 7 p.c. may be paid: and anv
surplus has to go towards a reserve fund.
Such a fund is certainly very desirable : for,
in addition to the capital which its own
shareholders have risked in the business,
they have £115.0X5 of other people's, most
of it bank overdraft. On the other side there
are. £10(5,477 of sundry debtors —no doubt
largely made up of advances —and it is a
good thing to have a fund apart from capital
to provide for contingencies in a business
of that size and character. On the six
years’ history prior to the dotation of the
co. a vendor wasn’t likely to part with the
business except at a substantial figure; but
even with an average profit of £13,198 there
wasn’t a margin large enough to provide for
a sufficiently-rapid reduction of. so large a
goodwill as- that which actually figured in
the prospectus. Ilad there been no guar-
antee it certainly would have been thought
necessary by this time to have accumulated
£BOOO or £10.000; and that would not have
allowed of an average dividend of any more
than 5 p.c. p.a. on the inflated capital of
£150,000. Things may, of course, change
completely; but on present appearances it
seems highly probably that on the expiry of
the five-year guarantee period the dividend
will have to come down to the figure just,
mentioned —assuming that the business is
f|p a’naged with due caution. Even for the
present the directors, or some of them, doubt
the wisdom of actually distributing a 7 p.c.
dividend, even though the vendor guarantees
it; and a proposal was afoot (what hap-
pened to it The Bulletin doesn’t know)
that of last year’s dividend 2 p.c. (=£3000)
should be deferred.

This extraordinarily successful concern must
feel the coming pinch more than most. At
present it is being maintained in its afflu-
ence by the tail-end of the borrowing boom ;
and when that disastrous beast goes round
the corner, it will rub a good deal of the
gilt off this co.’s profits. Already the output
has suffered considerably: during the latter
half of 1914 the sales amounted to £29,661,
while in the past six months they were only
£25,452. Thus far, however, there has been
no great slump in the building trade in
Sydney, partly because of the extensive
works in progress, when the war started, and
partly because advantage has been taken of
the better value now obtainable to carry out
jobs which had been deferred on account of
previous high costs. But “To Let” boards
are beginning to dot the suburbs ; and that
means an early slackening off of speculative
building. While the boom has lasted this
co. has had a great time. Not only has it
been paying 20 p.c. of late on watered cap-
ital. but it has been laying by a nice bit.
Look back over five years:—
June, ’3 0. June, ’l5.
Liquid assets .. .. £6539 £21,730
Liabilities . . . 547 838
Surplus assets .. £5992 £20,872
So the co.. besides paying its very fine divi-
dend, has laid by £14,880 in five years: and
the capital five years ago was only £40,800.
In addition it has bought more quarry land
at. Guildford and has carried out consider-
able improvements at Emu Plains. Mean-
time, no doubt, there has been some depre-
ciation ; hut it is probable that the improve-
ments more than counterbalance the wast-
age. Nor will the bottom altogether drop
out of the business when the bottom drops
out of the borrowing and building boom:
there will still bo moderate pickings to be
got out of the supply of materials for
patches and repairs.

Three things have told against the company
during the year—drought, war, and the
decreased output from Broken Hill mines,
due of course to the war. Oversea shipping
lias to some extent revived, and so has
Broken Hill, but S. Aus. business is still
slack, and will be until after next harvest.
However, looking back over the years, the
co. has nothing to complain of. Take a
seven years’ comparison :
June,’oB. June,’ls.
Assets apart from tugs, lighters, etc. £32,021 £15,743
Liabilities .. ... .. .. 2,087 1,636
Surplus .. .. £29,934 £14,107
S > in those seven years the co. has cut
£15.827 but of its mostly-liquid assets; but
during Hie same period it has provided
itself with a steam lighter (for the Broken
T T ’ 11 flux business), which cost, ahni.it.
£17.000. and lately it had a tug built in
Britain at a cost of about £15,000. Maybe
the* other plant isn’t worth quite as much as
it was seven years ago; one or two hulks
see-in to have got beyond service even as
hulks. But the shrinkage cannot amount to
much. At any rate, two vessels which seem
to have cost over £30,000 have been pro-
vided in seven years, and approximately half
of the cost has come out of earnings which
have been left over after paying the dividend.
As for the new tug, by the way, at latest
the Admiralty had collared it; so the c-o.
will most likely have to get another one
built. It ought of course to be produced
in Australia; but the dreadful experience of
the Commonwealth in connection with the
building of the Brisbane is enough to make
any co. think hard. And it is enough to
make any barracker for Australian industry
curse hard.

No, don’t envy these people their 15 p.c.
Instead, look at the two or three lines which
introduce the table, and note that the capital
was written down, as an average, from £5
to £l, so that a 15 p.c. dividend is really
one of 3 p.c. As to some part of the capital
it is a lot worse even than that. The prefs.
of course suffered least: hence they get
only 5 p.c., while the rest get the bigger
amount. The ordinary capital was cut down
so horribly that there was little more than
a smell of it left; but it was agreed that, if
the old assets should turn out to be worth
more than their valuation, the surplus should
go to a special reserve for the benefit of
these ordinary and of deferred shares. As
a matter of fact, much better values have
been got for most of the old assets than was
expected ; so the special reserve has grown
like this :—-

But that fine source- of “profit” is running
out: the properties on hand are now valued
at only £46,339, and the chances are that
they won’t fetch such prices as those which
have been sold during the last few years.
What the c-o. has been doing with the
money as properties have been sold is shown
by the next table: —

Roughly, in 10 years properties of a book
value of £270,000 have been sold for some-
thing like £360,000; and this money lias
been used to pay £lOO,OOO off deposits, to
make £145,000 of advances and add £117,000
to the liquid assets. To the old depositors
£155,000 was still owing on June 30 (it
was included among fixed deposits), and
this lot was payable a few days ago. Hence,
no doubt, the accumulation of liquid assets
during the last year or two. The with-
drawal of this fixed deposit money will leave
the co. with very little besides its ow r n
capital to work on. Yet, if it wants
deposits, there is no reason whatever why it
shouldn’t get them—if people have the
money to lend. The security, at any rate,
is undeniable. The co. has over £300.000 of
its own funds, and with this £155.000 repaid
it won’t have so much as £150,000 of other
people’s money in the business. Profits must
remain small while it has so little outside
money to work with. On the other hand,
the shareholder has the consolation of know-
ing that, if he isn’t making much profit, he
at least hasn’t been taking much risk ; and
there has been a good deal of risk about
advances made on the boom values of the
few years which preceded the war.

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cat,tie dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

ROYDS, LTD., Investors’ Advisers, Challis House, Sydney
it they didn’t close up, H. R. Denison, the
chairman of the co. which held the Tele-
funken agency, fixed up an amalgamation
with the Marconi principals in London;
and the table shows the history since the
new concern took things over as from Dec. 1.
1912. Up to that time it is doubtful
whether either concern had made a profit.
For the first six or eight months after the
amalgamation the two organisations had to
be more or less maintained; nevertheless,
competition being past, a loss was now easily
dodged, and a dividend of 4 p.c. on the capi-
tal, equal to about 21 p.c. p.a. for the 19
months, was declared. Things were then
shaping very well ; but in the past six months
profit from the trading account —apparently
in connection with installations —has almost
disappeared, owing, of course, to the sup-
pression of private apparatus. Gross profit
from this branch in the previous half-year
was £6937; in the past six months only £993.
Also traffic revenue —derived from messages
between ships’ passengers and shore-—has
been more or less cut into by various restric-
tions. So the ordinary profit for the term
was only £1673. To that has been added in
the table £2935, received net from the Com-
monwealth Government in an action brought
by the Marconi people. This amount lias
been used to write down patents, etc.
And that brings up the question of re-
serves. When the co. w r as formed £90,000
of the capital was supposed to be represented
by patent rights, licenses and exclusive agen-
cies. Strictly, perhaps, the table ought to
start off showing that amount as a deficit: it
certainly isn’t represented by anything
tangible. At any rate, it must be clearly
understood that the patent rights, like a
lease, are a wasting asset, and that the true
profits can only be shown by writing off each
term something towards extinguishing this
fugitive asset. In the first period £3OOO was
written off. Since then no part of the ordin-
ary revenue has been put aside; wherefore
neither tin* £7SI2 of the one nor the £1673
of the other half-year is the true profit. If
£5OOO in hard-cash profit were put by every
year it would be IS years before the capital
now represented by paper was represented
by money; and if £5OOO were written off the
ordinary profits of last year there wouldn’t
be a great deal left. True, as mentioned
before, the past year was a time of very
exceptional difficulties; nevertheless, this
need to cut off large slices of revenue, in order
to make good the principal, must be kept in
mind. It will seriously affect the profit
even in the best of times.

Shareholders in the Colonial Sugar got
a surprise when, opening a circular this
week, they read of a special meeting on the
29th to authorise the directors “to distribute
in specie amongst the members” the pref.
shares in the new co. which has taken over
the Maoriland and Fiji business. But a foot-
note says “the term ‘in specie’ used in the
resolution means ‘in shares,’ not ‘in cash,’ ”
and Heaven and the co.’s counsel only know
why the resolution didn’t say so. Share-
holders who want the new scrip put in
someone else’s name must give notice on or
before the 28th.

The negotiations between the Tasmanian
Government and the Hobart Gas Co., for
the purchase by the former’s Hydro-Elec-
tric Department of the Gas Co.’s electrical
plant and undertakings (mentioned B.
9/9/T5), have advanced another stage.
With enthusiasm the Gas Co. shareholders
have ratified the provisional agreement, and
it only remains for the Government to get
the approval of Parliament. The price is
£lOB.OO0 —£8000 in cash and £lOO.OOO in
Treasury bills bearing interest at 5 p.c.-
and the date of the transfer is October 1.
How good the proposal looks to the Gas Co.
may be judged from the fact that a year ago
if was prepared to sell out its electrical
business to the Hobart Corporation for
£BO.OOO, but could not do a deal. Under the
influence of the Government offer the £lB
Gas Co. shares are quoted at £3O. and the
shareholders are suggesting that something
in the way of debentures or extra stock
should be passed out to them on the
strength of such a >srood stroke of business.
B. H. Junction North has been giving its
plant some exercise, and has increased its
stock of lead concentrates from 781 to 1300
tons. Surplus assets are said to be now
worth £120,000 against £99.262 in Septem-
ber, 1914. But most of this value is in
slimes, and so far it has proved a heap easier
to pay a big price for slime than to get any-
one to pay a big price for slime concentrates.
In 31- years New Burragorang (N.S.W.)
has produced 905 tons of silver ore averaging
£2l per ton. In a recent eight weeks 1221 tons
realised £2434, and values range now from
£l7 18s. 6d. to £22 per ton. The half-yearly
meeting in August ended with a comfortable
assurance that New Burragorang was out of
debt, and that there was a surplus of £2519,
of which £l2BO was cash. There is, how-
ever, £l5OO owing to the people who sold the
property to the present co., and this is to be
paid by deducting 25 p.c. from money set
aside for dividends. The directors are
anxious to push on with development, and to
improve ventilation No. 8 west is to be con-
nected with the Yerranderrie next door.
From a man who has been watching
developments from Melbourne :
Who got first cut into the Edna Deeps market
doesn’t matter. What is now certain is that the
Deeps is the surprise pack'et of Westonia next to
the big mine. After it had been turned down by
the Edna on a bore that went away west, mine-
surveyor Macartney had the pluck to shove it off on
to a co. with the testimonial that those who had
th“ grit to back it would find the lode coming into
the claim at about 440 ft. The sniffing over Macart-
ney’s prophecy still echoes in the Perth Club ; but
the fact remains' that in a bore from the Deeps
shaft at 250 ft., just over the Edna boundary, 26ft.
of quartz has been run through from 440 ft. down-
wards. The grade is reported 2oz. for the first
Bft. and loz. for the balance. After that comes
footwall country carrying stringers of quartz, such
footwall being reported in some quarters as granite.
Seemingly manager Stuckey was told that unbeliev-
ing Didymuses were questioning his core values.
He remarks that the doubters are liars, which isn’t
polite but is emphatic. He has “many indepen-
dent witnesses of values,’’ he says—a superfluous
remark, for his own word is good enough. The true
width of the quartz where bored is given as 21ft.
r lhe drill also confirms what the Edna’s own bores
disclosed—that the lode underlies very flat to the
north, and explains how it is that the No. 4
depressed bore put in from the Edna 300 ft. crosscut
to get the lode at 400 ft. furnished only negative
evidence.
Centrals got jumped on heavily because of the
Deeps strike, but the extinguisher is not on the
claim by a long way. The Deeps bore is so close to
the corner peg of the three mines that unless the
shoot makes west steadily the pitch will carry the
lode into the northern section of the Central, if it
does not cut out. Another bore or two on the fan
principle will settle that, if the Deeps directors have
cash and pluck enough to do the work.
Ivanhoe’s latest half-yearly estimate of ore
reserves shows an increase of 3 1,525 tons in
quantity and a decrease of Gd. per ton in
value compared with the figures of six months
ago. The total on the present guess is
1,030,243 tons, worth 365. 9d., and is made
up as follows:—East lode, 698,317 tons,
average 355. 9d. ; middle lode, 3 54,841 tons,
average 38s. Bdr; new lode, 133,886 tons,
average 85s. 2d.; Boulder lode, 23,399 tons,
average 655. lid. Allowing 255. per ton
for loss in residues and cost of production,
this gives a profit in sight of £8 per share,
or nearly a third more than the present
market value.
Another hitherto promising Westralian, the
Sand Queen, has become disabled at depth.
Very little payable ore has been exposed at
500 ft., and only traces are showing at the
No. 6 level. Inroads made by the mill on
the ore reserves have necessitated the stop-
page of half the mill and the sacking of most
of the men. The owners, Frank Sloss and
Co., are hopeful of the shoot righting itself
in deeper ground; but when they once go
wrong in that part of the West they rarely
recover. In an unpretentious way the mine
has produced 60,000-odd ounces of gold, and
paid £lOO,OOO in dividends.
Apparently the new find at Mount Hol-
land. 90 miles south of Southern Cross
(W.A.), is not altogether a duffer. Several
eosteens show the lodes to carry values over
a fair length, and the visible gold area is
expanding. The discovery of water, too,
has improved prospects.

Ivookynie (W.A.) is reported to be com-
ing again. At its best it was a one-mine
town, and when that mine went to pieces it
shrivelled up. Now, as a result of a few
encouraging finds in neighboring shows, its
admirers reckon that a revival is imminent.

“Oof Bird”: George I). Meudell, of Mel-
bourne, has written the Westralian Mines
Department, “cordially disagreeing” with its
geologist’s opinion regarding the non-exist-
ence of oil in that State. Incidentally the
enthusiast has a dig at every Australian
geologist bar one on this subject. He says : “I
cannot understand why they condemn the
idea that petroleum exists in the Common-
wealth. Australia holds everything else, so
why not oil? Yet the various State geolo-
gists except Twelvetrees, of Tasmania, scorn
the' idea of ever striking it. Why? Are
they paid to stop prospecting for oil, or to
encourage it and help the prospector offici-
ally?” Well, over here in the West they are
paid to protect the public, and so far they
have done their work uncommonly well.
Minister for Mines Collier (W.A.) asked
Parliament the other day to agree to the
appointment of check inspectors, and sub-
mitted the following casualty list in support
of his request:—393o : Fatal, 29 ; serious,
587. 1931 : Fatal, 37 ; serious, 528. 1912 :
Fatal, 35; serious, 491. 3933: Fatal, 26;
serious, 741. 1914: Fatal. 26; serious, 831.
For the first seven months of this year:
Fatal, 20; serious, 487. The proposal
is an old one, previously scorned by
the Leg. (Council. State-subsidised in-
spectors are to be elected by the Miners’
Union; they are to have full power to initi-
ate prosecutions, call and cross-examine
witnesses, Take a hand at inquests, etc. As
further evidence of the need of check inspec-
tors Collier quoted the opinion of Dr.
Cumpston, an admitted authority on the sub-
ject, that he found 33 per cent, of under-
ground mine workers employed in the State
to be suffering from fibrosis. The Assembly
has acceded to Collier’s request, and he has
told the Council that if it doesn’t agree it
will only hurry along the day when the
powers which it now possesses will be trans-
ferred to the Commonwealth Parliament.

Duke Extended, Maryborough (Vic.), still
struggles to get its head up. Just £50,000 of
calls and gold have gone into the mine with-
out a solitary div. to cheer the suckers. The
co. lias a fairly big block of ground round
Nos. 3 and 4 rises to panel, and it has been
getting some fair prospects off No. 5 rise.
But cheaper work— not lower wages, but a
lot more hustle—will have to be available if
the old mine is to pay.

Poor Petrie was hardly under the sod
when his old favorite, North Johnsons, Ben-
digo, got on the move after being for years
stuck in the mud. In tlie depths, of the
m-ne the quartz is about as barren of gold
as a boarding-house plum-duff is of fruit,
(.alls for years had shrivelled up supporters,
till, as a forlorn hope, someone thought of
attacking the old Camerons back between
1000 ft. and 1150 ft. This meant going for
a synclinal formation, and Bendigo won’t
do that except when on the rocks. The
work carried out shows that in this case
the old ’uns who chucked up north on the
back at lOOoft. were only a few feet short
ol a nice dab of gold. The trough is tumbled
abput and may only yield a patch ; still tlie
little bit coming along may place North
Johnsons on the dividend list again. The
find has also given the big Johnsons Iteef
Co. the chance to quit 7000 forfeited shares
a l xr flgllre which supplies cash to start work
oil iSo. 2 shaft after the same syncline shoot.
Vulcan tin (N.Q.) pays another 3d. divi-
dend (£•>.>()()). The latest monthly return
was 734 tons for £2123, following 077 tons
Most of the good ore from the
, t'T 1 Mope is coming from an area of
VV 10ft., and the pipe is becoming smaller.
Ihe 750 ft. level has become poor, but to
compensate for that the 600 ft. level stupe is
better. A drive at the 750 ft. level is in
search of. another , make. The Vulcan is a
patchy mine, but it has come again so often
that it is never safe to despair of it.
* * * *
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, Charters
Towers, has declared a 3d. dividend (£1200).
A similar amount was distributed in July.
The last crushing of 355 tons returned £2030,
averaging £5 14s. Bd. per ton, following 492
tons for an average of £8 19s. 7d. Alto-
gether £6OOO has been declared this year,
which is equal to Is. 3d. per share. There
has been an increase recently in tlie quan-
tity of stone crushed, but the quality is
lower. In the first five months of this year
SB5 tons gave £8768, which compares with
* lle ]™U atest ret «rns aggregating 847 tons
for £6653. The reef is patchy in value and
irregular in size.
Little St. Mungo (Q.), largely owned in
Charters Towers, is looking better again. A
lateral deposit from No. 4 south level has
been struck, and No. 5 north is showing 20in
of shipping ore. The trouble is that re-
serves are very small, and if development
rails_ for a while there is a scare that pro-
duction is at an end. The capital is £5OOO
in 40,000 shares; and they were quoted at
4s. the other day.
* * * *
Wallaroo (S.A.) pays a quarterly half-
crown (£20.000) with present ease." The
ancient concern has increased its output, and
is now producing at the rate of nearly 2000
tons of copper per quarter. Still oiilv an
excellent market can enable it to pay" 10s.
per share per annum (£80,000), because
the cost of the very necessary development
ot deep levels is mopping up a lot of
revenue.
. Kingston Oil Wells Co. is making a new
issue of shares at 25., evidentlv im-
pelled by the South Australian Oil Wells
Co. s report that it has seen petroleum in
its Robe bore at 1163 ft. The Kingston Co.
holds 20 square miles of oil areas near the
Ocean Oil Co.’s bore, now well down
on its way to where it is believed the
oil sands are.
On the present look of things antimony
mines will soon be almost as common as gold
mines in Victoria. A mostly-Melbourne co.
has just taken off its coat to open up a belt
of country in the bush at Clonbinane, near
Kilmore ; and various other likely patches are
being prospected. L
# #
“Gumholes”: In 1900. 1,5- years ago, gas
was struck in the Roma bore, which gave, on
analysis, a paraffin base; and yet no deter-
mined effort has been made to find the
oil pool from which the gas came. The Ryan
Government . has now promised us an Oil
Monopoly Bill. If that will monopolise to
the Government all prospecting for oil, this
generation can cease to hope for any benefit
from a Bananaland oil industrv. Surely if
there is one activity which might be left to
I rivate Enterprise longer than others it is
prospecting. It is such a wild-cat game, with
success often as not due to ignorance and
faith in one’s own luck, that with a Govern-
ment guided by expert opinion, pulled by poli-
tical strings, clogged and doomed to wasteful-
ness by an impersonal interest, there are a
thousand chances to one it will fritter away
money and find nothing. Let the Govern-
ment, when the oil is found, claim a certain
area and handsomely reward the prospector,
and leave prospecting to the fever-brained
class who have done such valuable work for
Australia in every other class of mining.
We do not want to be exploited by local
monopolists, but we would like, if the oil
is here, to tap it and be saved from the ex-
ploitation of foreign monopolists.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, September 20, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Mayor Richards travelled up to Gosford to
open its 31st annual flower show. A few
Sydneysiders who also made the journey
came back bursting with enthusiasm for the
lunch provided by the committee and the
gorgeous vision of bush flora in the School
of Arts. The only criticism was that the
show had a prevailing feature which used
to shout for help at Manly wild-flower dis-
plays—the blooms were squeezed so tightly
together that the little pink roses were
almost scarlet with suffocation.
The vice-regals are making a procession
among North Coast butter factories and
musical prodigies, and the trek won't close
till the middle of this week. Miss Strick-
land, who likes these country jaunts with
father, has the Titian-haired Miss Finn to
back up her admiration for the fatted calf
and the bloated sugar-mill.
Captain Segrave, who has been lying in
port for a few weeks while his cruiser Dash
was refurbished, has been recalled to London,
probably for another job. Captain Baillie-
Hamilton, who has been here before, takes
his cabin.
Dr. Ashburton Thompson passed out in
London last week, after a career which Syd-
ney remembers with gratitude. In the days
when Plague stalked the rat-haunted water-
front, and even the squeak of a mouse
sounded like the advance of bubonic legions,
the Board of Health chief put his finger on
ihe spot, and by his campaign established a
reputation that was easily world-wide. The
city has grown older and cleaner since then,
and Thompson was the man who, until his
retirement a couple of years ago, did more
than anybody else to make it wash itself.
Mrs. Thompson was a daughter of the late
Julian Salomons. When the big doctor pro-
posed the lady was a widow, having married
in the first place a son of the late Justice
G. B. Simpson. He had two brothers, who
loved music as he loved it himself—Gerald
Marr, long-time the S. M. Herald’s first-
night critic, and HCmilius, who for many
years mixed his crotchets with the medical
oversight of S. Australia’s one big prison.
The green fly-nets that are going to
Turkey are weird-looking net bags with
elastic bands at each end. The Gallipoli fly
is more numerous and pestilential than the
Australian beast. So the floating mesh-
veils that dangle round a bushman’s beard
would be no fence against the Mahometan.
Enthusiasts in the country who yearn to run
up this millinery are therefore warned not
to copy the local article. The Dardanelles
model fits the hat at the top, while the lower
elastic clutches the soldier’s throat. Where-
upon the baffled enemy squats on the Kan-
garoo’s broad shoulders, and says the brute
would be too tough, anyway.
For a modest penny you can record a vote
for the Queen of Allies’ Day. Several theatri-
cal stars of one million candle-power are
hinted at as competitors. In spite of the
Dreadful Secrecy insisted on it is safe to
guess that there’ll be at least one red head
and one mop of flaxen curls in the Corona-
tion Stakes. The beautiful simplicity of the
voting scheme is that every lady is not only
allowed, but encouraged, to supply her
friends with as many voting papers as she
chooses to pay for —or as she can wheedle
them into paying for. Cash is the thing,
and the votes help to buy bread for Serbs
and Poles and other lean belligerents.
like this make the world seem
a very small ant-hill. Ex-Aide Wallis and
Major Macnaghten, formerly on Governor
Strickland’s staff, were wounded on the same
day at Gallipoli. They were carried down
to the same hospital ship and were able to
inquire about each other’s damages every
morning in Egypt. Now there’s word that
Macnaghten has been badlv hit again. He
was the young man who made such a suc-
cess of his job when he was area-officer in
the Woolloomooloo district.
The linen tea at South Sydney Hospital,
with Matron O’Connor in charge, brought
forth a plentiful supply of visitor’s with
brewn paper parcels under their arms. The
Willie Cooper dame was handed the inevi-
table bouquet when she stepped out of her
petrol chaise. In return she gave the
nurses good value in a 20-guinea cheque.
Miss Stone, who was purred over by the visi-
tors, was the lioness of the tea party.
Formerly a sister in the Zetland Hospital,
this tall grey-eyed nurse is just back with a
batch of wounded, after months of waiting
on the injured Kangaroo. She goes back
shortly to Egypt.
Chaperoned by G; G. Neill, of the Tourist
Department, a party of pressmen had a
recent week-end at Burrinjuck. From
Goondah to the village by the great dam
they travelled iu the tram that bumps along
over a foot gauge. Access to this meeting
of the waters is better than it used to be,
and as many as 300 tourists in a month
have been shown the local exhibit by the
Government guide. But the idea of making
it a wildly-popular resort for ladies who
travel with several Saratogas is still in the
nebulous state.
For the finals of the Manufacturers’ Week
competitions, the Repertory Theatre was
filled with fond relatives who were respon-
sible for gusts of applause. Some of the
talent on exhibition was 6ft. high and wore
tin 1 swallow-tails of an effete civilisation.
Some more of it was large and buxom and
swathed in long skirts. But the best of it
was young and tender, with sweet, chirrupy
throstle calls. Little Thelma Burness, the
star child singer, promises to warble like a
nightingale if her notes are not forced before
she thinks of putting up her golden locks.
Mr. Vicars, of the Chamber of Manufactures,
handed Thelma a medal to go on with. He
passed on a similar award to Minnie Hig-
gins, a flaxen-haired infant whose recitation
was another sparkling circumstance.
In the midst of a dust storm, Minister of
Education Griffith last week laid a founda-
tion-stone. It was a memorial slab for the
new Golden Fleece Free Kindergarten. The
old rookery had been pulled down to make
way for the brick tenement for which an
enthusiastic women’s committee has bor-
rowed about £l3OO. John Mackay, presi-
dent of the Union which barracks for the
children of mean streets, gave out the text.
I think it was: “Blessed is the beggar, for
her bowl removes mountains of mortgages.”
Mr. Griffith having patted the little grey
slab into its niche, the committee put its
gratitude into a trowel brooch for Mrs.
Griffith. Secretary Ellen Desailly (who
now adds up figures for the kindergarten in
an office in the new Education Palace),
Mrs. John Mackay, the redoubtable Mrs.
Francis Anderson, and Mrs. W. G. Boor-
man were foremost in the proceedings.
Mrs. Barff, wife of the Uni. registrar, is
a steady goer on the trail of Good Works.
Her latest hobby is the new League of
Honor, by which some of the ’Varsity
women hope to help the little things that
Tommy leaves behind him. This week’s
gathering was in St. James’s Hall.
Mrs. Louis Barber is the surviving sister
of the late Justice G. B. Simpson. The
old lady, avlio is in her eighties, is, like other
members of the Simpson family. Sydney-
born. She belonged to the days when travel-
ling was set with thorns, and has never been
out of Australia. Till her memory flagged
she used to tell quaint tales of Sydney in
the era when a water-cart dripped round
the streets with supplies.
Papal legate Cerretti paid a visit to the
Jubilee fete for the Kincumber orphans.
Hordes of youngsters swarmed round the
arrival, in the hope that the vdeasaut-looking
Italian would wear his best purple frock.
But be made an unobtrusive entry, and so
far as the color of his clothes went you
couldn’t have told him from an undertaker.
The visitor had a rest from the voice of the
raffler during a long programme dotted with
juvenile performers.
At the fancy-dress carnival for the Ivin-
cnmber kiddies, Mrs. Hugh Ward did the
judging, and handed Miss Amy Yard’s
pupils several prizes. In the infant section
the best effort was made by youngsters who
masqueraded as the pots that said the kettles
were no gentlemen.
The age of miracles is not yet past. In-
stead of the loss that threatened at the open-
ing of the 10 days’ Town Hall raid for the
Kincumber orphans, the St. Joseph’s sister-
hood are joyfully counting their profits. The
drawing of the Art Union on Saturday night
finished this gallant attack on a raffle-tired
world.
The Bank of New Zealand’s chairman, Mr.
Harold Beauchamp, came this way from
Wellington last week.
Sydney will be feeding the monkeys at
the new Zoo next Easter. The Public
Works Department, having money to burn,
has taken the construction over, and is
rushing it forward. The job won’t be com-
plete till June, but they will march most of
the animals two by two across to Bradley’s
Head in April or thereabouts.
I hope that somehow the late Alfred
Usher knows what a beautiful funeral he
had. The Liedertafel was there and sang
its sweetest. Mrs. Hugh Ward by chance
heard of her old friend’s serious condition a
few hours before the light flickered out.
But the last bar was reached so suddenly
that she was the only friend to see the
kindly old gentleman off.
Young Arthur Champion, eldest son of
Canberra’s Anglican shepherd, who was
wounded some time ago, was at latest in a
London Hospital, having an injured knee
massaged. Two younger brothers have thus
far done their bit without reported mishap.
The new flounced skirts will billow round
Randwick lawn for the first time on October
2, weather permitting. On the same crowded
spring afternoon the Cullen lady will open a
patriotic sale or robbery at Gordon.
The Girls’ Realmers who learned first-aid
at the knee of Dr. Emma Buckley swell with
pride at the lady's latest achievements. Dr.
Emma is supposed to know the domestic
habits of most microbes. While waiting to
go to the Front she has been acting as bac-
teriologist in a London hospital with such
success that still another Australian is being-
talked about in the big antheap.
Mrs. Ralph Worrall had a tennis party
the other afternoon. Any lady who had
forgotten to take a Christmas gift for sol-
diers in the Island hospital would have been
assured of a chilly welcome. But nobody
was so absent minded.
The large, handsome Margaret Vinton
continues to wear fascinating frocks as the
dress-designer to the firm of Potash and
Perlmutter at the Criterion. Her black-and-
white creation in Act 1 is a shimmering-
white garb, touched with the raven hue the
magpie flaunts on his waistcoat. The
Criterion was a very full house on Satur-
day night, with a sprinkling of khaki to
remind us of the war —in case Abe Potash
was making us forget any row but his own
guerilla warfare with his partner. Chief
Secretary Black sat in the front row of the
d.c. Inquisitive neighbors were unable to
decide whether he crossed his legs at one
crisis or merely knocked his knees together.
The Assembly adds to its good looks by
the return of George W. Fuller for Woilon-
dilly. There is no more carefully-
groomed man than the ex-Federal Minister-
the first, by the way, to climb so high as a
seat in the Commonwealth Cabinet and then
creep so low as a perch in the State fowl-
house.
The osprey has by no means perished in
the general cataclysm. But it droops nowa-
days like the curve of a crescent moon. I
saw a specimen at the theatre the other
night in its present tamed shape. It is
much better to sit behind the 1915 bit of
fluff than it was to meet one in the days
when it reared itself like a tousled nine-inch
quill upon a frightful porcupine.
The Women Painters have revoked their
intention of holding a show this side of
Christmas. They have postponed the
annual affair till the autumn.
A search for queens is foaming over even
the most unpretentious suburbs. Balmain,
which wants cash for its Civil Ambulance
and hospital, is thrilled with the quest.
Dr. Bob Stopford has stepped aside from
his pet hobby, bull-pups, to work as hon.
sec. of the carnival.
On October 1 and 2 the Repertory
Theatre houses a show for the Red Cross.
Thelma Maddrell, of the large Braidwood
family, is starred iu double-sized letters
in the amateur cast.
William Murdoch, the tennis-playing Aus-
tralian pianist, was here on a return visit to
his native land about three years ago, and
rumor then engaged him to various Sydney
damsels. Now he has really done it. But
on the other side. The girl who wears the
engagement ring is Ellen Tuckfield. She is
a musician, too.
Prof. David’s only son is with the
R.A.M.C. in France. A son-in-law, Dr.
Mclntyre, who recently got his diploma at
Edinburgh ’Varsity, is also off to the Front
—or as near the Front as the surgeons are
allowed to go.
It will be interesting to note whether the
shy Russian pianist Pintel will get a show
in the scramble for billets at the Conserva-
torium. Pintel fell in love with Australia
when he toured it as the pianist of the
Calve co.. so he came “home” to Sydney a
couple of years ago. But he hides his light
behind green baize doors, where lie culti-
vates the Young Person, and gives musical
refreshers to lady amateurs.
In spite of the din of war specials the
Ideal Home Exhibition, fathered by the In-
stitute of N.SAV. Architects, will be held
next month at the Town Hall. Every
woman is invited to send in her own plans,
and show, incidentally, what she thinks of
male architects who design kitchen fixtures
for lady giraffes, and generally build a small
house as if the woman who runs it had 40
legs.
H. J. Preston, of Sydney, who was one
of the first men in Australia to beat his
motor-car into an ambulance, is still driving
the vehicle for the Red Cross in France.
Thea Proctor, the handsome Mosman girl,
is still pegging away at fan designs in her
Chelsea studio. She was a successful exhibi-
tor at the recent International Society’s
show in London.
The Persian Garden Song-Cycle encore
has been pushed further forward into Octo-
ber to avoid a collision with race-week.
There is a notion of getting either the
Little Theatre or the Royal for the repeat.
Little Mrs. Quesnel, who used to teac-h
vocal trills in Sydney, is spending a holiday
in her old haunt. She is on the Elder Con-
servatorium staff in Adelaide now.
Old Lamps for New Vests is the latest cry
of the Sock Fund dames. They vary it by
asking for any old silver goods—thimbles,
brooches, trinkets, bracelets, etc. —for which
you have no further use. Heaven knows
what they mean to do with the oddments
that will pour in to the Sock Depot, Bull’s
Chambers. But they call it “The Silver
Thimble Fund” to provide sheepskin vests
for our soldiers.
The North Shore Hospital sends a wail
for help at a sale of work in the local School
of Arts on Saturday.
Parson John Ferguson, the big Scotcliby-
terian who is renowned for his wedding-
breakfast orations, tied the knot between
W. Scott Fell, of the Mosman family, and
Doris McDonald. The bride’s male parent,
a major, was detained at the Dardanelles
by a circumstance over which he has less
control than he hopes to have presently. It
wears a fez.
There are still quiet hearths where the
din of battle does not drown the hum of
the kettle. Home Reading circles gather
in these nests. This week Mosman, which,
like Lane Cove, is inclined to literary medi-
tation, is going to house a gathering to dis-
cuss the writing of Richard Sheridan. It
is a far cry to Tipperary! At Woolwich
these circles occasionally rub each other up
the wrong way by meeting to discuss the
ethics of Marie Corelli. Even knitting is
liable to be suspended when “The Sorrows
of Satan” is attacked with a gimlet.
The committee that packs up comforts for
the Army Service Corps—(lie hewers of
wood and drawers of water for the fighting
men—occupies an upper chamber at IS
Barrack-street. It has just sent off three
cases of garments mixed with chocolate and
cigarettes. On September 27 a matinee to
achieve Christmas presents is booked for
the Palace Theatre. The J.C.W. firm is
letting some of its mummers off the chain
for the occasion.
Dr. Ercole, one of the best-known of
back-country surgeons, passed in from Gren-
fell the other day on the way to the Front.
The story goes that the last time he was
in his native Italy he had to run for it. An
impulsive youngster, lie got mixed up with
political scheming of which the Government
didn’t approve, and, being at the time in
the Army, was put under arrest. The
guard consisted of men whom he had com-
manded. Seizing a favorable chance, lie
simply ordered his captors to do something
or other, and skipped across to Switzerland.
But liis Government forgave him a year or
two ago.
Another Italian doctor, Sisca, who has
fallen on more evil days, was removed from
the roll last week for “infamous conduct.”
After years of ill health this unfortunate
was driven to lend his name to a Sydney
“health parlor.” One watches the descent
with sorrow. Sisca was the first medical
man to try to arouse the public of Victoria
to the seriousness of “miners’ disease” —a
subject which has since had much profes-
sional attention there and in Westralia, and
especially in South Africa.
French Consul Chayet has just come back
to the dizzy round of patriotic shows after
a month’s holiday in Queensland,
Amongst the minor horrors of wartime is
the Theatre League’s threat to sponsor a
missing-line playlet at the Queen Victoria
Club. The guests, of course, are to fill the
void.
The Arts and Crafters are having a rocky
time. The society keeps its spirits up, how-
ever, with regular doses of mental food.
This takes the form of lecturettes on such
subjects as native timbers and thoughts on
furniture. This month’s snack consists of
architect John Sulman’s remarks on the
Renaissance and Modern Architecture.
The Frencli-Australian League of Help
iu Sydney is scouring town and country for
warm garments wherewith to meet the com-
ing winter in Europe. The end of our own
alleged cold season fills the wardrobes of
the well-to-do with surplus clothes. There
never was a better use to which they might
be put than the League can find for them.
Miss Soubeiran is hon. sec.
Prophets who predict that ostrich plume's
are “off” this season don’t know the eternal
feminine. The woman who will look the
other way when she sees a feathered hat
that fits hubby’s purse is not born. In spile
of the promised orgy of floral millinery, any
knowledgajble Petticoat will swear that race
week and fowl fluff will run in double
harness. The wider brim which is creeping
in with warmer sunshine takes very kindly
to the graceful plume. Thank goodness, the
tragic toques of Easter week, rising like the
profile of North Head on the feminine brow,
are only memories.
Yours affectionately.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, September 20, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Lady Helen in her spirited defence of
Dr. Barrett pins discussion down to the
question of lied Cross stores or no Red
Cross stores on the Ballarat. She severely
ignores the most vital charge made by Dr.
Springthorpe, namely, that there was no
Red Cross depot nearer the Front than
Alexandria for fully 11 days after fighting
began. There were no supplies of Red
Cross comforts —or very few —on the hos-
pital ships which carried the first fearfully
wounded Australians back to Egypt. The
journey in some cases took four days. There
were no pyjamas, air pillows, sheets or other
comforts of the sort. The men reached the hos-
pitals in Egypt in the shot-torn, mud-stained,
blood-covered clothes in which they fought.
Surgeons, operating full speed ahead for 10
hours at a stretch, could only have the
actual wounds bound up. Doctors at the
Front were crying out for milk-foods for
the wounded, while there were hundreds of
tins of the stuff held up at distant Alex-
andria. All these things have been estab-
lished, also that there was money in plenty,
-besides stores of everv kind of Red Cross
comfort in Egypt long before that first
fighting. Whoever neglected to prepare
for the big emergency should not need
any other Hell than the thought of the boys
who “died of wounds.”
At Stonington, where the Victorian State
Governor is housed, Yates the butler still
reigns in the pantry, even as he did in the
days of coach-proprietor Wagner, who built
the mansion. After the Wagner executors
sold the place to the Government. Yates
became a public servant, and as such has
stood at the elbow of 5| Governors —Syden-
ham Clarke, Talbot, Carmichael, the late
John Fuller, Madden and Stanley. Yates
is a beautifully round, pink, mellow speci-
men of his kind, with a ripe voice and a
sympathetic manner at table.
Walter “Coomete” Bayles, a grazier in
the fatted Caramut region of the Western
District, runs about 2000 head of poultry in
addition to the sheep which pay his land
Year after year Bayles enters a pen
or two at the Burnley egg-laying competi-
tions. Last time his hens came 50th in
an entry of 50. Was Walter down-hearted?
Not a bit! He had a heart-to-heart talk
with the ladies, and the figures for this year’s
competition show the “Coomete” birds to be
only a few cackles behind the leaders, run-
ning third, with a good chance of being “in
the money.” Walter Bayles is a brother of
Norman, who is M.L.A. for Toorak, where
the society hens roost high.
The fashionable Macoboy sisters gave
their threatened big concert at the Audi-
torium last week. Outwardly the two girls
looked Dreams, but inwardly, they were vol-
canoes owing to several maddening hitches
in the glorious arrangements. For one thing
not a single Governor turned up, though
they had pretty well all promised they
would. The result was that the carefully-
upholstered semi-circle reserved for them was
occupied only by the John Maddens, the
Dame for once in severe black instead of the
customary royal red plush cloak. She sat
up very straight and clasped a dainty little
bouquet of spring flowers hard and tight
in her hand. The second tragedy concerned
the programmes. Very elaborate books had
been ordered, full of portraits of the stars.
These artistic treasures went astray, and
hurried slips were printed for the informa-
tion of the people who were to provide the
applause. These were doled out at sixpence
each by girl sellers, and the victims paid up
cheerfully enough, though they had been
waylaid at the door by collectors for some-
thing or other. When the concert was half-
way through, the lost programmes turned up
and the vampire girls (tulle and ribbons
and all) came smiling with them and their
collecting boxes! But this time the audi-
ence drew back with agonised moans, and
the rattled management tried to reassure
everybody by giving the things away at the
door as the listeners left for home.
Molly Macoboy was the prize frocker of
the family. She was in black. Wynne
came a good second; her lot was in black
and white that somehow had a grey effect.
The long programme was made longer by
the performers’ determination to give en-
cores if the audience so much as sneezed.
Mary Conly, plump and portly, was
wrapped in a flame-colored gown with black
net clinging tightly to the generous curves.
It carried my mind back to the well-filled
grates of winter. Rita Hope wore flame-
color, but it was a different tinted flame,
worn very, very short and side-splitting.
Natalie Dawson sported her blue satin cor-
sets over her fluffy petticoat —or that’s how
it appeared to the puzzled costume-spies.
Marie Noski looked like a Mrs. Humphry
Ward heroine in simple white, and Mollie
Taylor gleamed and glowed in white satin
with a pink rose.
There were loads of enthusiastic lads in
khaki present, and flags and decorations
helped to give a martial air to the function.
Thirty of the soldiers belonged to the 14th
battalion, whose number p: or young Mick
Macoboy also wore till he was killed at
Gallipoli. Some of his wounded mates who
had been granted special leave from the
base hospital hobbled in.
_ Mary Conly sang “To a Hero” exqui-
sitely. She is becoming so plump, however,
that she finds difficulty in bowing. Mrs.
Fryer, the Maeoboys’ teacher, who came on
at the last to help with “Rule Britannia,”
wore a black velvet and silk arrangement
that resembled pa’s very elaborate dressing-
gown.
On Saturday the Quamby Club seethed with
bridge, song and commerce to provide a room
in the heart of the city where wounded
soldiers who have medical appointments in
town may go for rest and nourishment. A
luxurious produce stall faced the lift in the
corridor, and matrons of great social tonnage
amazed their cooks, who didn’t know where
they had been, by landing home at unearthly
hours with baskets of vegetables. Mrs.
Alawa Buchanan won two dressed <-honks
and a bottle of champagne for a shilling.
For the milder type of gambler there was
roulette, a soldier with one arm in a sling-
acting as croupier. Mrs. Leslie Stuart pre-
sented two bridge tables out-and-out, and
then invited her own chosen plungers. Miss
Hume Black’s orchestra played, and Maggie
Stirling sang. Daughter Mary (Mrs. Croom),
in purple velvet, dimples and pearl earrings,
adorned the programme in both a musical
and decorative way.
From the official recorder in Adelaide:—
C. .T. Valentine, the ex-Chief Inspector of Stock,
died at North Adelaide on Sunday. When T. T.
Morris decided to exchange the billet of Chief
Inspector of Sheep for that of manager of Anlaby
station in ’65, Mr. Valentine stepped into his shoes
and almost immediately was appointed with M’s.L.C.
Bonney and Cavenagh to inquire into the great
drought of ’G4-’66. .They inquired very thoroughly ;
but it would have been better for Australia if they
had abolished the thing.
Another old colonist to pass out during the week
was Mrs. Douglas Gooch, of Cooke's Plains, who
arrived in the State in ’55. Her father, the late
J. Loudon, took up a pastoral lease in the Far
North that afterwards became known as Yadla-
malka, and while there • opened ’ up and workgd>
Cariewerloo station, out-back from Port Augusta.
From there Miss Loudon married Mr. Gooch, who
was her father’s partner, and when the drought of
’64 drove the settlers from the north, Mr. Gooch
took charge of various stations, finally going to the
Burnside estate, near Strathalbyn, where he died
about 12 years ago.
T. B. Harrington, the Adelaide manager of the
National Bank, has received news of the death of
his son Keith at the Dardanelles, in the early part
of August. Tlis other boy is reported ill, and in
hospital at Malta.
The temerity of N. S. AVales in launching a Uni-
versal Service League has stirred up the local Peace
Society, which passed a hurried resolution expressing
its entire disapproval and abhorrence of the whole
affair. Up till about a year ago there were people
like that in Belgium. But the Huns soon con-
verted them.
The howling north wind played over the Outer
Harbor on Monday, with the result that the Mol-
davia had to hang about doing nothing till things
calmed down a little. This is the second time in
a few months that the delay has occurred. Which
looks as if hostile critics of the Outer Harbor
scheme knew what they were talking about.
The Cheer-Up Society gave a good-bye lunch to
750 Expeditionaries on Saturday, and a couple of
days afterwards the latest batch of returned wounded
were given a reception at the Town Hall. There
was a Gift Afternoon for Army Nurses at Austral
Gardens on Thursday, and on the same afternoon a
start was made with the building of the Cheer-Up
Soldiers’ “Hut,” at the back of the City Baths, by
the turning of the first sod. The land has been lent
by the Government for as long as the society wants
it, unless railway extensions complicate matters, in
which case the “hut” will have to be transported
elsewhere. The whole thing is being made as plain
and bright and airy as possible. There are no
“decorations” —for which may the Heavens be
praised!—and the general idea has been to get as
much comfort as possible for the money— £15,000.
The Dickens Fair next week is being relied on
to bring a good cheque for the building fund.
J. W. Searcy, a cousin of the clerk-assistant of
the Assembly, has been lifted from sergeant to lieu-
tenant in the Australian Engineers at Gallipoli.
He was in the landing of April 25 and has been
slightly damaged twice.
A motor smash at a level crossing on the recently-
opened Willunga railway resulted in the death of
R. H. Trezise, who was driving the car, and Mrs.
Luke, the wife of the manager of Tatachilla vine-
yard. Mr. Luke is on his way back from Marseilles.
The three-year-old Arts and Crafts Society held an
exhibition on Monday, which the Mayoress opened
without casualties. Of course the war- has affected
the society, but for all that the show of exhibits
was good. The committee has purchased a spin-
ning-wheel, and intends to give lessons in the home-
industry our foremothers knew so well.
A long-dated after-death honor has come to
Nathaniel Whight, a baker, of Edwardstown. Nearly
two years ago he was fatally burned while saving his
mother in a household outbreak of fire. A Iloval
Humane Society's certificate has just been awarded
to him!
Will Ashton’s picture-exhibition was the most sue-
eesiful thing of the kind, in Adelaide for years.
People not only attended, but bought, G.-G. Ferguson
setting a good example by acquiring a view of
Adelaide as seen from the Hills, and Hans Ileysen, a
fellow-artist, following suit. During the week
nearly 40 pictures were sold.
Mr. Allen, of this city—the same who in
his peaceful moments works a patent dye
which makes flappers of grandmothers and
restores faded fashionables —is going to the
same old spot. There is wailing amongst
the Touched Up who depended on the per-
sonal administrations of the Restorer. This
war is brutal.
The patriotic auction has done'its dash.
A special feature of the cafe chantant at
the Oriental on the 12th prox. has been thus
advertised : “There will be no auctions, with
the exception of one flag.” Once the initial
dollar has been paid, the patriot’s only
remaining duty will be to sit down to a
beautiful afternoon full of tea and cakes
and Red Cross talk.
Captain Broad returned this week to
home and wife. The latter was Miss Beat-
rice Best. He was badly wounded in the
landing at Gallipoli.
Mr. Black, of Tarwin Aieadows, the
rich Western District bachelor who ran a
little milking herd of 1000 cows, is the latest
eligible to join the army.
Artist B. E. Minns, who returned to Aus-
tralia last week with a view to getting among
the blacks again and painting them in their
habits as they live, left his wife in England.
She is absorbed holding up an umbrella or
something to shield the Minns establishment
near Hendon from bombs. Their place is
close to a big aerodrome which the Germs
would dearly like to burst up. Minns dis-
closes the fact that a colony of Australian
artists is springing up at Golder’s Green.
Hilda Spong’s brother (the scenic artist) is
there, and George Ashton —in addition to
the Minuses. The village has only cropped up
since the advent of the big Flying School,
and now everyone wonders why it didn’t
arrive before. It stands high over Hamp-
stead Heath, and the scenery is beautiful.
The Minuses have also a mia-mia at Folke-
stone, which is opposite Boulogne; and all
the summer the occupants heard the crack —
rumble —boom of artillery. Kipling, stay-
ing at Brighton—farther along stilt —also
confessed to being troubled by the artillery
racket.
The George Fairbairns’ son Clive cables
the family headquarters that he lias"-got a
commission in the Scots’ Guards.
Norman Bayles last week lost his wife,
who had been an invalid for two or three
years. Before her marriage she was
Marion Clarke, of Hobart.
Buried at Boroondara a few days
ago, Mrs. J. S. Armstrong, whose name
woke up a lot of Victorian Law Court his-
tory. For very many years John Simpson
Armstrong was Crown Prosecutor at Gen-
eral Sessions at Geelong, but he lias been
so long dead that this generation hardly
remembers anything about him.
There was a rumor that Willy,.Lawson,
who used to flutter round Melbourne some
years ago, had gone to the hideous length
of enlisting in the French army. As a
piou-piou he would have got |d. a day (less
separation allowance for dependants), while
the use of his motor-car and his man-
servant would have been withheld from him.
The dreadful story turns out to be apocry-
phal. In point of fact he has taken a large
house in England, and is living in sylvan
quietude with George Walker, one of Syd-
ney’s imperishable twins. London is fre-
quently refreshed by the appearance of
William and George in such costumes as
Solomon in all his glory would have been
disqualified from the Tabernacle for wear-
ing.
Old W. B. Cumming, of Mount Fyans,
who had made one of a sheepish half-dozen
in the Mortlake shire council for the past
33 years, has at last given up local politics
and taken to his armchair and slippers.
There are various ways of getting immortal
fame, and you might win it even in a shire
council. But please don’t think that “W. 8.”
was out after anything so unsubstantial.
You see, there are several Gumming estates
in the Darlington region, and the family
has always found it worth while to keep
one representative in the council.
Colonel Rhodes fled through Melbourne
the other day on his way to Egypt, where
he will be the commissioner representing the
M.L. Red Cross. Sister Mrs. Allister Clarke
came down from her beautiful country
garden to see him off, and trade-commis-
sioner Manson and other male Maorilanders
edged m a farewell dinner. “Bill” Crow
flapped through the city in the wake of his
principal, to whom he will play private sec-
retary. Crow says he has not had time to
breathe or brush his hat since he made one
in the Andrew Fisher expedition to Eng-
land. There was a zoological tinge about
that passenger-list—Fisher, Lamb, Shep-
herd and Crow.
Tommy Cochrane is acting as town guide
to a brother in khaki, who looks like a mag-
nified image of Tommy himself. The
warrior was through the African campaign
under Botha, and was also concerned in the
far-back Boer war. Pleased at still being
whole in wind and limb, he came this way
to see his mother before trying his luck
again.
Despite the Zeppelins, Mrs. Frankie
Stewart Murray is busy jumping on the lids
of her various Saratogas, which are all lab-
elled “London.” The flaxen-haired kidlet
Mary, who is one of Jennie Brenan’s prize
pupils, goes with her; and Mr. Murray (I’d
nearly forgotten him) will be at hand to see
to the luggage.
One of the late Francis Ormond’s
adopted daughters (he had two, and an
adopted son) is now the widow of a Western
District Austen. She has been devoting her
time and money to the care of our soldiers
in the Egyptian hospitals. The part of
ministering angel should suit her, for she is
a pretty blonde woman with an endearing
manner. I hear the wounded Australians
are devoted to her. The hot climate, how-
ever, interrupted her good work, and she is
down here for a brief rest.
Oakleigh Hall, the Melbourne home of
Prime Minister- Fisher, was the scene of a
festive but subdued gathering on Saturday
afternoon, when Elsie Irvine, sister of Mrs.
Fisher, promised to obey Leonard Motteram,
of. Port Melbourne. There was only one
bridesmaid, Miss Annie Irvine, and the quiet
affair was stage-managed by the Rev. C.
Strong.
Edward Bromby, an old identity of his-
toric Heidelberg, who was one of the scholars
present on the day when Melbourne Gram-
mar School was opened in 1858, was also on
the spot, as a member of the school council,
at the installation of headmaster R. P.
Franklin the other day. Edward Bromby’s
headmaster, in that first school year, was
his own father, the late Dr. Bromby, one-
time Dean of Melbourne.
Lorna Cooke, a Frankston girl, lias gone
to Egypt to lend a hand with the wounded.
Auntie Estelle Leinpriere, who is in touch
with the nurses, will teach her how to do
real work.
The handsome Mein widow who, owing to
ill health, has not shouldered the house-
keeping burden since her return from her
last overseas trip, is back in her St. Kilda
mansion. She has changed its former label
Falkenstein to Hazel mere, and feels a little
better for it already. Son Douglas, who
enlisted in England, has received the usual
commission and started for the Turkish
trouble in charge of a machine-gun.
Anne Williams and Harold Smith are
giving a vocal and piano recital in conjunc-
tion on Thursday evening, September 23.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen have promised
to toot up, the University has lent the Melba
Hall for the occasion, and the proceeds are
going to the Red Cross.
Florence Hull (Mrs. Arthur Kenny, of
Tasmania) has published a recruiting song
for which her parson-brother, Tremlett Hull,
of Skipton, supplied the words. Dufault
made a success of one of her songs, and she
is now writing him another. By the way.
the Frencli-Canadian, who is now in the
U.S.A., is due back in Australia next
August.
One recently-chronicled engagement has
ended in a hurry. The bride-elect has left on
a trip to England with her mother; the for-
saken swain is hurrying towards one of the
Fronts; and the parson who might have got
the job has climbed a tree.
Mansion holders in the most exclusive
Domain-road portion of South Yarra (let’s
hope there will be “exclusive” spots in
Heaven!) are fiercely opposing the conver-
sion of the George Cliirnsides’ palace into a
private hospital. Confound the sick! Blow
the afflicted ! Let ’em go and get well some-
where else!
Miss Lucy Rowe is handing out buckets-
ful of encouragement to budding musical
talent, and spraying the tender shoots to
kill the eodlin moth of criticism. There is
to be a party at the Reps’ Club on October
1, when some pale, new stars are to flicker.
Stella Tower, a soprano Conservatorium.
pupil specially favored by Melba, will
strengthen the programme. The little
Scapini from Maoriland will make her first,
bow in Melbourne at this show. —The ex-
perienced Hal Elvins is to attend to the
accompaniments and play some of Fritz
I lart’s compositions.
At Jellalabad, the Tom Dowlings’ ancient
Western District squattage, a bunch of
local sheep-owners gathered around the
old honeysuckle arbor the other afternoon,
and by earnestly selling one another a
variety of pincushions, Victoria sandwiches,
bottled fruits and so on raised a hundred
pounds for the Red Cross. Mrs. Gerald
Gumming w T as the organiser.
Young and Jackson’s ancient nooker.v,
opposite the Central Station, changed hands
18 months ago, the Young boys having been
warned in a dream of the dry wrath to
come. Norman Young, who had for some
years found a uniform of use at evening
parties, is now Major Young, of Gallipoli.
The tall wife of an absent-in-Egypt
medico lately devised an entertainment for
soldiers’ wives. She roped in a girl who
owns a pretty voice as sole performer. When
the soprano presented herself at the hall
where the entertainment was to take place
an Officious Person who was acting as door-
keeper greeted her with “Are you a mother?”
The dazed singer .murmured, “Er —no —not
yet!” “Unless you are a mother,” the O.P.
continued, “you casb’t come in.” “Well,” fal-
tered the soprahsQ| ratlier short notice,
isn’t it? I’m afraid they’ll have to postpone
the entertainment.” Then someone rushed
to the rescue, and all was peace.
Lady Juliet Duff has been laying down
the principles of her new Economy League
in London. She “strictly avoids” latest
fashions in dress and pre-war fashions in
costly feeding. She entertains only one or
two intimate friends at lunch instead of a
“catty” mob, and she often “frugally” feeds
off “chicken and pudding, or even meat and
cheese.” These economies are touching
suggestions of “top-hole” patriotism. The
fifth pledge of Lady Duff’s League binds the
League to employ “no men-servants except
ineligibles.” Presumably when footmen
Jeames and Chawles plead ineligibility, the
League doctor is sent for to put his stetho-
scope to their fatted calves.
Yours sincerely,
JIHABBAL
lou Ward's proposal to tax petrol and
kerosene has raised a growl of protest from
fishermen and settlers in the Sounds districts.
Kerosene, the main illuininant for country
people and the poorer folk in the towns, and
petrol, the motive power of the boats on
which the settlers who live in the bays and
sounds depend to reach market, are absurd
things to tax, anyhow, unless there is a local
product crying for use.

Pooh Boon” : I’d like to inform “Pick”
(b. 1w 8/ 15) that eels make the headwaters of
the North Tableland, Monaro (N.S.W.), and other
streams the terminus of their wanderings, but they
certainly do not ascend the waterfalls. If they can’t
get round them they go up other branches, devoid of
cataracts, whose headwaters are not far re-
moved from the sources of the streams in which the
waterfalls are located. Then they make a land trip
across. No baby eels are ever found above these
cataracts, which goes to prove that eels do not breed
in such streams. Has anyone ever discovered an cel
m N. S. Wales western waters? I’ve fished in most
or the streams between Longreach (Q.) and Moama
(N.S.W.), and invariably failed to land one.
* * * *
To M hare”: A curious and patient in-
vestigafor found recently fully-formed eels, micro-
seopic in size, but quite lively, in the
float of female eels taken from creeks
in the New England (N.S.W). district.
These young things would in due season
leave their parent’s body to face the
world on their own account, in direct
contradiction of previously-accepted scien-
tific opinion, which avers that all fresh-
water eels, when mature, descend to the
sea to spawn and milt. The female hav-
ing disburdened herself of some trifling
10,000,000 ova, or eggs (the number
being estimated by cutting off a small
section of the roe, counting the eggs in
it, and calculating the remainder), and
the male having fertilised this enormous
provision for posterity, both give up the
ghost. They never return
to the fresh water, but the
young eels, on hatching
out, invariably work up-
stream. Thus says science ;
but the recent discovery casts suspicion
on this theory. Another case in point.
In the damp mud at the bottom of a
dried-up waterhole over a mile from the
sea I found a large eel lying under a flat
stone, and beside it a wriggling bundle
of young eels from about 4in. to 12in. in
length. If these young eels were not the
fry of the large one, but members of an
enormous family hatched from ova de-
posited by some other eel or eels in salt
water, then they must have worked their
way up a partially-dry watercourse, and
eventually arrived at the residence of the
large eel—an unreasonable assumption.
The breeding arrangements of the eel
have puzzled the brains of humanity ever
since the days of Izak Walton, who
wrote: “Some say they [eels] breed by
generation, as other fish do, and others
that they breed, as some worms do, of
mud ; or as rats and mice and many other
living creatures are bred in Egypt by the sun's beat,
or out of the putrefaction of the earth. - ’
David G. Stead, the Ma State Fisheries
expert, added a sft. 7in. banded sea snake to his
vast collection of marine objects the other week,
it is the largest of this venomous species yet hauled
in this part of the world, and was picked up at
Farqubar’s inlet, Manning River.
“To Babarantiko”: Compared with the
brown men of the low-lying coral islands of the
Pacific, the fellah of Egypt and Black Brother of
Queensland (B. 20/8/T5) are the veriest lubbers in
the matter of climbing. The men of the Coral
Islands would scorn the use of the rope grummet—-if
they knew about the thing, which they don't. Grasp-
ing the stem with both hands, and partly grasping,
partly pressing and stepping with the soles and sides
of the foot, they walk up a perpendicular vegetable
«oft. to 80ft. high (double, and more, the height of
the date palm) with ease and celerity. Should the
climber require a rest, which is seldom, he hangs on
in squatting position, helping to clasp the stem with
his knees. The way up is travelled with little frog-
leaps, giving to the looker-on rapid flashes of
quickly-moving yellow-white foot-soles. When nuts
are “pulled,” i.e., cut down, for copra-making, each
man climbs a considerable number of palm trees in
a day. Even women do not hesitate to climb the
“toddy” trees, in which, however, notches are cut
for the prehensile toes. Farther west, down the
Archipelago, when any of the mighty forest trees
are climbed to rob the wild bees of their honey, a
few stout pegs are driven into the trunk about three
feet apart, as the man mounts, and pliable rattan is
tied to the pegs in such a manner that if any peg
breaks or comes oiit the pegs above and below carry
the extra weight. In this way it takes these climb-
ers but a few minutes to reach the first branches of
the great trees.

“Ben Sun”: Asa twister swamp red-
gum can beat jarrah every time and give points to a
politician. Some of my neighbors built houses with
the timber, and now they wish they’d fallen down a
bottomless well first. The windows are twisted out
of action, the doors are out of plumb, the roofs look
ashamed of themselves, and the township wilhelm-
goat makes incoherent remarks through the floor
openings at night.

“Alamon”: Warn “Vigilans” (B.
24/6/’ls) against erecting a fence of Northern Ter-
ritory paper A ark. It’s splendid timber for building
purposes, so long as it does not touch the ground,
but it always rots at that level. For rafters it is
unsurpassed. Cypress pine, after seasoning - , is prac-
tically indestructible, but if used in the green state
is liable to dry-rot. White mangrove, cabbage-gum
and pandanus are utterly useless for building pur-
poses, being the favorite items on the menu of
white ants and borers; yet red mangrove, ironwood,
and what we Territorians call fanpalm are nearly
as good as cypress pine, especially if seasoned. “Vig-
ilans” is correct when he says that as a mattress it
is unequalled. It is also unsurpassed as a cradle
for baby Binghi during the first few weeks of his life.
THE HORRIBLENESS OF GEORGE.
FLEURETTE: "Aren't men horrible? It's five
o'clock, and I’ve been waiting for George
ever since half-past four.”
DOROTHY: “What time had you to meet
him?”
FLEURETTER : “ Half-past three.”
BROKE HIS HEART.
FERGUSON: “Glad your dog has quit barking at night, Simpson.”
SIMPDON : “Yes, he got discouraged. We hare twins at our house now.”
“Kairuku”: My Papuan house-boys
reckon we’re going to fix the Germans for good arid
all. I was showing them a photograph of my son
taken with his company. “How long- small tawbada
he go fight?” asked one of them. “Oh,” I replied,
“till the big war is finished.” Later on I heard him
telling some of his friends: “Small taubada lie signed
on alonga big Government to fight till all Germans
dead.”
* * -X- *
“Hay”: That cook of “Milo’s” who used
to paralyse plain turkey's by flying a kite over them
(B. 12/8/’l5) was an expert leg-puller. In the far
northern parts of S. Aus. I have seen droves of plain
turkeys feeding quite unconcerned while kite-hawks
hovered over their heads. By the way, kite-hawks
used to be known to bushmen as Babbage’s chickens,
because so many of these scavengers accompanied the
explorer on his return from Australia’s interior. The
kite is a great camp-follower ; but all the turkey he
ever eats is what the cook throws out, and plain
turkey is such good eating that there is very little of
him wasted. Our way at that time when out after
turkeys was to head a team of loose working bul-
locks in their direction and advance under cover of
the animals till near enough to get a shot. They
appeared to take little notice of horses or bullocks
approaching them. I remember a fine plump bird
141 b. weight from which the cook took two pickle-
bottles of fat in the course of the roasting process.
“Barcoo”: “Lou,” in a recent Bulletin,
describes barcoo as the summer sickness of western
cattle camps. This is penned on the Barcoo River
(W.Q.), which gave the illness its name. Cattle
have given place to the jumbuck, yet the infliction is
as persistent as ever, summer or winter, providing
the flies are numerous. If the grass is green and
abundant the common fly generates in countless and
unbelievable myriads, and hands on barcoo to the
sheep-men. The only way of escape is to take no
food containing sugar and no sweetened tea. Do
that, and you’re immune.
“Ben Sim”: “Pick's” assertion (B.
19/8/’l5) that “furnace stokers yell for stringy-bark
every time” is moonshine. Some years ago, when
the N.S.W. coal-miners’ strike compelled the use of
wood fuel on the Vic. railways, various kinds were
tried as steam-raisers, and stringy-bark got the
unanimous boot off the engine. The medal went to
the closer-grained and heavier box, ironbark, etc. As
to fire-kindlers I’ll back Murray pine every time.
Once started, the sparks will kindle any judiciously-
insured building; in the open, they will kindle the
adjacent country if the time is ripe.
“Pay C.”: I can go one better than
“T.F.’s” 21ft. shark, caught by engineer Walker in
Trial Bay (N.S.W.). Melbourne Museum possesses
two specimens of the Charclrarodon rondoletii breed
that when they stopped growing- touched the 22ft.
mark with their hind tail. Each possessed a diges-
tive cavity that would accommodate The Bulletin's
largest Fatrnan with ease, and if he had got his
deserts a row of molars that would make a
circular-saw look cheap would have been used in the
process. They were deep-sea rovers, and it was dur-
ing an ill-timed visit to Fort Phillip Bay that a
full stop was put to their careers. Fishermen oil
Brighton were responsible for their introduction to
Melbourne's collection of man-eaters. Sea-tigers of
the Rondoletii family have been caught that could
extend the tape 40ft. between tail and snout, and
they bear almost as bad a reputation amongst fisher-
men as a German does in Louvain.
* * * ■»
“Billy Bung” : Twenty-two years of bush
life entitle me to a vote in the best-timber-for-fuel
election. I plump for boree—easy. It is essentially
a good heater, being hard, compact and durable.
Experienced men say that the heat of a boree fire is
too intense for most engines, and lighter woods have
to be used with it. As proof of the durability of
the wood I have seen some posts which were . split
from it and put down 30 years ago. They are still
standing, and show little sign of decay.
“Barcoo” : Being on the Leichhardt River
(Q-) "hen a mob of travelling cows was put on
camp, I was initiated into an act that was new to
me. Eight or 10 animals were cut out, thrown and
hobbled by the innd legs. The bloke-in-charge
explained that these cows had dropped on the
journey calves which had to be killed, and the
hobbling was to prevent the mothers meandering
back at night to look for a lost child. The hind-
leg hobbling safely anchored them and saved many
a weary mile’s ride in the morning.
*•“('. J.”: About one farmer in live gives
his cattle sufficient salt. The local storekeeper
threatened reprisals when I asked him to haul out
2c-wt. on each of his fortnightly trips, but between
us we’ve been teaching the surrounding cockies some-
thing, and the storekeeper has since offered to make
me a present of his grandmother. The daily allow-
ance for stall-fed cattle is four ounces each. As
mine never see a stall I give them one ounce each.
I have known cattle craving for salt to eat anything,
even old iron. One fourdegged lady of my acquaint-
ance puts in part of her time daily li king a rusty
fence.

Beside the clear pool where the wayfarer stands
With eyes to the east as the first crimson streak
Of morning comes gilding the Mittagong Creek.

“Bad Australian”: In some of the out-
back S. American mining districts the methods of
working are still about as primitive as when Manco
Capac started out from Titicaca with the golden
wedge which located the holy city of Cuzco. Speak-
ing more particularly of the copper country, in
many places you find a little crowd bandicooting the
better-grade ore, and reducing it in the old Inca
“horno,” a concern something like the burnt-out
white-ants’ nest in which I used to bake my damper
and ceratodus steak (yes, steak) and fresh-water
mullet in the bad old days on the Upper Burnett
(Q* ), what time the dingo howled around my humble
dwelling and the flying-foxes squawked and
hummed in the leafy bloodwood overhead.
The horno is usually run under difficulties
as to fuel, the only combustibles on hand
being dry llama dung and a curious vegetable called
jaretta. Jaretta looks exactly like a gigantic billy-
button, growing out of the ground without a stalk.
It has the pungent, aromatic smell of a Chow joss-
house, and spilits like a free mountain ash. There
is, or was, a vegetable of very similar appearance
to be found on the tableland between Mole Creek
and the Great Lake (Tas.). Jaretta sometimes attains
a diameter of upwards of two meters, and contains
more resin than any other vegetable I have bumped
against. After the first fierce ebullition it burns
exactly like white box or red-gum bark. The slag-
heaps from the liornos, both ancient and modern,
being in every case the refuse from 2.5 p.c. to 40 p.c.
ore, contain very high values of metal. The bandi-
cooters, like the old Inca, always sink on the under-
lay, and their lifting-gear consists of a series of
poles of the giant cactus fished- together and laid on
the footwall with cleats across at intervals. The
bunch generally hire, beat or bluff some Indian labor
into their service, and on a fine May morning, when
the poor Indian is painfully shinning up the impro-
vised fowl-escape with a greenhide bag of ore on his
shoulders, remarking, “Eaigh-eaigh” at every step,
it is brought home vividly to the onlooker how these
unthinkable, half-breed Dagoes tortured the Indian
away back in the uncivilised days before the good
and holy institution of “grub-staking” was invented.

Somewhere in Australia at this moment
a wearisome person all the way from U.S.A. is trudg-
ing along with a yarn about having, for a huge wager,
set out to walk round the earth and accumulate a large
quantity of. dallars by the sweat of his chin. A
queer push these boot-tourists, and their tales are of
infinite variety. The latest of the tribe has a pictur-
esque story about terrible experiences in the Orinoco
country (South America), where vampires seized on
him, it “being a peculiarity of these creatures that
they make two punctures in the big toe, through
which they suck the blood.” Why the gentleman
didn’t keep his boots on is not explained. The
Orinoco vampire is, however, a relatively harmless
animal compared with his brothers whom the travel-
ler will meet when he gets to Melbourne. The
peculiarity of these brutes is that they make 15
holes in their victim’s pocket, and by the time,
gorged like leeches, they abandon the unhappy
wretch he couldn’t walk along- Bourke-street without
being run in for having no lawful visible means.
The explorer now on the Australian landscape re-
ports that in the West he walked three stages of 240,
252 and 273 miles respectively without seeing any
water except what he carried. So he seems either a
mighty near relation of the camel or a heavyweight
carrier of some circumstance. Possibly he learned
a trick from the Orinoco vampire, and lived on his
own big toe.
HOME NEWS.
THE SOLDIER : “I may run across Bill at the
Front. Any message I can deliver?”
BILL'S DAD: “ That’s hind of you, lad. Just
you tell Bill that Strawberry’s last calf
turned out a heifer.”
“Outcast”: The paper bark ti-tree men-
tioned by “Vigilans” (B. 24/6/’l5) is also well
known in Papua, especially west of the Fly River.
It grows plentifully in the low open country border-
ing along the Paho, Oriomo, Morehead and Bensback
rivers, and attains considerable girth. The country
in this district is extremely like the northern part of
Australia, dried up in summer and a swamp in the
rains. All the tribes west of the Paho use the paper
bark for house-roofing, and also for making women’s
petticoats. The wood is very durable; and, as far
; I have used it, I have found it resists white ants.
Moreover, to a very great extent it'defies the cobra
worm ( Teredo nrnalis). There’s any quantity of the
timber in the west of Papua, and it’s a wonder some-
body has not taken it up for milling, especially as
most of the rivers are navigable.
A GENTLE HINT.
BILL: "Yer dorg 's bloomin’ thin, Jachy. Looks as if yer starve ’im.”
JACKY ( hinting ): “No blurry pfear, Boss. That pfeller gettem tueker every time I
gettem bacca.”
“ Warradulla”: I used to think that
“Barcoo” knew everything or even more, but I was
wrong. He asserted (B. 19/8/’l5). that the charges
of cruelty laid against the Afghan are over-done,
and intimated that the Abo. who said he saw ’Ghans
splicing goat-skin into a broken patch on a camel’s
back “is verging on lunacy.” Now, I have lived
for over eight years in Broken Hill, almost next door
to a camel camp, and have seen Abdullah “dealing”
it to his ships of the desert scores of times. When
loading up and the beast has commenced to rise
prior to the burden being securely roped, I have seen
the owner rush at and fell the poor brute with a
sapling. And when the long strings of dromedaries
lope in from the distant stations Outback with their
swaying burdens of wool, I have seen some with
almost raw backs and others with blood squashing
out from under the pack-saddle. On one occasion I
saw a piece of old boot sewn with twine across a
hole in a camel’s rump, and maggots were dropping
out from behind the leather. That particularly un-
fortunate beast had lumbered beneath four great
bales of wool from away beyond Tibooburra. If all
this is not shocking cruelty—well, then I’m insane.
“Peri Winkle”: Further attention has
been given to that quaint water insect that “Risque”
(B. 12/8/’l5) reported from northern Victorian irri-
gation country, and as to whose iijnocuous habits
doubts were expressed. Specimens were sent to
Jas. A. Kershaw, director of the National Museum,
Melbourne, and he reports that the water insects are
small, perfectly harmless crustaceans, often termed
“fresh-water shrimps,” which occur at times in large
numbers in shallow water, such as ponds and pools
formed during the wet season. They always swim
back-do wnwards, and feed upon minute organic
matter. Large numbers of eggs are produced, which,
when the pools dry up in summer, remain quiescent
in the mud, and immediately hatch out when rain
oomt i. “Risque” and his settler-friends will have
to blame something else for the mysterious loss of
stock. The so-called “fresh-water shrimps” with the
blue shell must not be confounded with the water-
s’ sects of the rivers that we bait our hooks with to
Lird cod and his relations. They are quite different,'
rc.-mbling more a limpet with a tail like a scorpion.
* * * *
“Poon Boon”: The controversy or dog-
fight as to how marsupials reproduce themselves has
been again aroused by a bush naturalist, whq re-
cently discovered in the pouch of a wallaby a young-
ster the size of a grain of No. 16 shot. The speci-
men has been forwarded to the Australian Museum
for examination. The bushmen’s belief that the
young are born on the teat seems strengthened by
this discovery. The scientists’ contention is that the
young are born in the ordinary way, and, after
birth, are placed on the teat by the mother. Well, if
she can handle a mite as infinitesimal as a grain of
No. 16 shot, she should be an adept at extracting
splinters.
“McNortli”: Last year an epidemic .or
something in that line happened to the citizens of
the deep along the western shores of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. From Biowen Strait (N.T.) to a point
400 miles down the Gulf millions of fish of all kinds,
sharks, dugongs and trepang died suddenly and were
washed up on the beaches. The weather was fine,
and there was nothing to indicate the cause of
the sudden rise in the death-rate. Fish in various
stages of deadness were strewn in some places knee-
deep. Trepang-fishers and others were unable to
anchor their vessels close to the shore on account of
the smell, and for months afterwards live
was practically non-existent. The niggers of Coburg
Peninsula told me that many snakes, lizards and
other cold-blooded creatures also died suddenly at
the same time as the fishes. Anybody got an ex-
planation?
* * -X- *
“Private 445” : “Fiinderino” (B. 10/6/T5),
alluding to the occasional outbursts of cannibalism
amongst boo-book owls, mentions their slaughter of
young birds. The laughing-jack has to plead
guilty to a similar charge. Out shooting a couple
of seasons ago, and hearing the squawking of a
young bird in a dead gum some distance away, I
hurried up in time to see (and hear) the whack
against a limb with which a Johnny stopped the
wails of a half-fledged starling. Stiil holding the
remains in his beak the murderer glided slowly to
another tree and entered a hollow, from which issued
an uproarious welcome.from the missus and kids.
“Billy T.”: All the bull-makers are not
Irish. It was a young Australian of Cockney descent
who explained to me the other day, “Mother isn’t in
—she’s getting ready to go out.” And it was one of
the native-born, and bush-bred, who in reply to a
question about the size of Wright’s place replied:
“My oath! It’s so big he don’t reach home till
half an hour after he gets there.” Ho was a Ballarat-
born Australian, too, with no Irish in his pedigree,
who explained when I went to examine the teeth of
the horse we were talking about: “No good lookin’
at them upper teeth. They ain’t there.”
* * * *
“J.R.K.”: Messmate or bastard stringy
are fair fuel, but I’ll defy “Pick” (B. 29/8/’l5) to
burn the real stringy unless lie drops it down the
chimney of the Devil's restaurant. In the Mt.
Garnet (Q.) district, where thousands of tons of
timber were burnt for charcoal, stringy is the only
thing left standing by the Italians who supplied the
Mt. Garnet Co. The only practical user of it is
Binghi, either io smoke a bandicoot out or to pass
the time o’ day to his mother-in-law.
* * * *
A party named Pullman (Bi
26/8/’l5) wants to know the meaning of the native
word “Kooyong,” I beg to refer him to “Cole’s
Family Almanac,” page 145, where he will learn
that “Cooyong,” a word said to have been used by
certain Victorian tribes, means “bandy-coot.” It is
allegedly taken from vocabularies assembled by that
earnest curio-chaser, A. C. MacDonald; but the
“bandy-coot’ part of it hardly reads like Mac-
Donald.
“S. S. Severn”; Tbe Northern Territory
has its “hatters.” One of him put into Pine Creek
not so long since driving’ a donkey at the end
of a pair of buggy reins. “Where to?” drawled Pinq
Creek. “Somewheres.” “Where from?” “TIT
Barrier.” Two thousand miles of sand and stones
and his own company ! He pushed off at daybreak
heading for God-knows-where.
* * * *
“Devilfish”: To fishermen only. Some
years ago the kingfish was as common in Tasmanian
waters as the barracouta is now. Kingfish then was
used as manure. Line fishermen have been known
to catch 45 dozen of the sea animal, averaging 121 b!
or 141 b. a-piece. That was in the good old days;
Now you’d hardly know a kingfish if you met him in
Tassy and he asked you to come in and have a wet.
* * * *
“Alamon” : Judging by Abo-liars’ reports,
the dingos of the southern States differ remarkably
from those of the N.T., since to kill the N.T. species
is a very simple matter. We lay a poison-bait along
one of the tracks that the dog is known to pass and
place a tin of water close by. Next sunrise gener-
ally illuminates a very dead dingo. Strychnine
is the usual poison, being quickest in action. In
laying the bait no endeavor is made to get rid of
the man-taint. Dingos have taken baits that had been
carried in a box in constant use as a seat.
They do not, however, always pick up baits that are
laid in the bush. A N.T. dingo usually comes and
goes along the one track, especially when foraging
around farms, etc., and baits decorating that track
are invariably taken._ None the’ less, the brutes
show a diabolical ingenuity in avoiding traps of
every description.

“Mulga”: The scrub tick mentioned in a
recent Bulletin by “Zamia” is responsible for some
awful Australian slanguage, but as a curse-producing
agency it is not in the same catalogue as the green
caterpillars which do business in the brigalow scrub.
A few minutes after this pest gets to you a rash
breaks out over the body and the interior feels as if
it were on fire. Such itching and pain couldn’t be
produced by a whole paddockful of stinging nettles.
The sensations last in varying degree for two or
three days. Perhaps somebody lias- a remedy.
SCARCE FISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He sought my humble door to-day,
His poor, supply of fish to, sell;
Up through his hat were seen to stray
His auburn locks; he had a smell
Suggestive of a factory wing
For double-salting British ling.
He asked for whiting ninepence each,
And “Garfish four a bob,’’ he said ;
Whereat the wife began to preach
And heap derision on his head.
She thought he was a robber bold,
And chided: “Am I made of gold!”
He smiled a sad, sweet smile, and sighed:
“Yes, lady, fish t&..scaic&! I swear
All up and down the bay I’ve tried,
And cannot catch ’em anywhere.
There’s few that’s left, -and-Aha't’s the truth —-
It’s all along, mum, of the drouth !”

Do You Know the Symptoms of
Kidney Disease?
Everyone lias heard of. kidney disease—hut' it is remarkable how very few
people know the symptoms of this most deadly complaint. Do you know . (an
you tell if you have kidney trouble, or not? Here are a few of the symptoms.
Aches and pains in the arms, legs, muscles and joints, puffiness under the ejes,
cloudy urine, headaches, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, swollen, aching feet, general feeling of v eak-
uess and. irritability, and a drowsy, heavy feeling all day long.
These symptoms are intended by Nature to warn you that
serious complaints such as rheumatism, backache, gout, scia-
tica, lumbago, gravel, stone and cystitis (inflammation of the
bladder) will develop if you do not act promptly. They tell
you that your kidneys are weak and need strengthening imme-
diately, and that you are in deadly peril of awful kidney
disease —the forerunner of that dreaded Bright s Disease,
from which, thousands of human beings die every year.
Now you know why delay is dangerous. Get a box of De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills at once. These wonderful
little pills are prepared especially for kidney trouble, and
their success is due to the fact that they do not pass through
the bowels, but go straight to the kidneys and bladder, remov-
ing the deadly poison, strengthening the kidneys, and enabling
them to carry on their work as they should do when in a
normal healthy condition. Do not be put off with ordinary
kidney or backache pills, because you don’t know —you have
no 'proof that they have touched' the kidneys. You cannot afford to waste
your money, so make sure that the pills you buy do go right to the weak spot

Pain in
the Back.

—the kidneys themselves, and do what you want them to—make you well.
When you take De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills you have this proof within
24 hours —when you see the blue-colored urine.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills are sold by all chemists at 2/9 and
5/6 per large box. The 5/6 is two-and-a-half times as large
as the 2/9 size, and contains enough doses to last you three
weeks.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause the poisonous
Uric Acid. Remember, to do this a real remedy
must pass through the kidneys and the bladder,
and not through the bowels, as most Kidney
Pills do. When you see the urine change to a
muddy bluish colour —a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Pills from all others —you
know beyond all doubt that they have put their
healing touch on the right spot —the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill straight to the
kidneys —that is the reason why De Witt’s give
such amazingly quick relief every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Took for that blue color.

“Hamer”: Australia is making many dis-
coveries about itself. The big upheaval lias
created a demand for dyes—especially khaki
dyes—and the German output being cut off
the supply is short and precarious. Under
that spur it has been discovered that myti-
colorin, which exactly fills the bill for khaki,
can be obtained from the leaves of the red
stringy-bark. It looks as if there is an
opening for another fair-sized industry—if
Private Enterprise has any enterprise.

“Chemicus”: Is not “Tenaculum” (P».
2/9/T5) a trifle late with his complaint re-
garding the British mode of prescribing
medicines V The 1914 British Pharmacopeia,
which came into force in Victoria on Sept. 1,
1915, uses for all its preparations the
gramme and millilitre (practically a cubic
centimetre). Already a few doctors are
dashing off their scrips on the metric decimal
system. No doubt the older generation of
doctors and chemists will cling as long as
possible to the old system of grains, minims
and ounces, but the new generation will be
educated on the metric system alone. The
next edition of the “8.P.” will undoubtedly
contain metric weights and measures only.
The only reference to Imperial measure in
the 1914 edition is the dosages of the various
preparations: these are given in both
systems.

“Risque” : Vic. Police Commissioner Sains-
bury’s back-to-the-blackfellow style of deliv-
ering police missives from hand to hand is
only in keeping with things. For the first
time in 45 years I have had to eat brown
sugar, and the missus has had to rake out
the old candle-mould and cadge some tallow.
Also we have eaten honey in the comb as a
luxury; the first crop of nettles after the rain
made up the first dish of greens for many a
day. Birds have gone towards the menu in
the absence of rabbit and sheep. Mush-
rooms have been a godsend, and pumpkins
left over in the paddocks from last summer
carried many families through the winter.
Why, Sainsbury is a mere amateur in
economy compared with some of us where
the drought was.

“Hermes”: When the war is over
.7. Bull ought to present the Stan-
dard Oil Trust with a souvenir, for it did
a great deal to save Britain. True, what it
did was quite accidental —an awful amount
of the good done in this world is accidental.
In this matter the Trust charged such a Ned-
Kelly price for motor spirit that Bull
angrily took to making benzole from his coal
deposits. Now, one of the by-products of
benzole is tri-nitro-toluene, stuff which is
necessary for the making of high-explosive
shells. Hitherto, all the tri-nitro-toluene
Bull used he had bought from Germany, and
when the war broke out he found himself in
a hole. He could not get the article from
Germany, and U.S.A. did not make it. Bull’s
own manufacture was enough to keep a Boor
war or a mere local disturbance of the sort
going, but this flare-up was a different propo-
sition. In one week around La Bassee the
British artillery fired more shells than it did
all through the Boer war, and anything like
a sustained advance was only possible if the
British artillery could, as Ben Tillett said,
“rain shells for 40 days and 40 nights.” For-
tunately, our father Bull makes a good deal of
the benzole he uses, and when he started to
make tri-nitro-toluene in a hurry he had not
to start altogether at the bedrock. Incident-
ally, there is a chance hereabouts for Austra-
lia to help the Empire considerably. There is
more than a suspicion that coal from the Mait-
land district (N.S.W.) is particularly rich in
t.-n.-t. It is up to either the State or the
Australian Government, or both, to investi-
gate, and, if the charge is proved, to. start the
manufacture of the shell-food and ship it with
all speed to where it will do the most good.
* * * *
“W.C.M.” : I am continually handling mer-
chants’ catalogues, American and Australian,
and I notice the difference. The American
brands himself “Manufacturer and Ex-
porter” ; the Australian, “Merchant and Im-
porter.” While the American invariably
talks of the number of hands he employs
and the size of his works, the Australian
carefully conceals the fact that he employs
only an office boy and a typist.
“Berowra”: “Boronia” (B. 19/S/’l5)
touches on a subject of interest to all Aus-
tralians who consider our woods equal to
any. I cannot back any other timber to
shrink and twist more than jarrah, but I
would point out that all our native hard-
woods have the tendency to “give” when,
even after years of seasoning, a new face
is put on them. The glory of blackwood
does not appeal to the better class of cabinet-
makers on account of these shrinking quali-
ties. A matter that should be sifted is
whether our timbers are felled at the proper
season. “Cut when the sap is down” has
always been the rule, but we apparently do
not adopt it, as it is much easier to work
the forests in summer. Also, scientific study
should bo made as to when our hardwood
saps are down. Old-world timbers show no
inclination to “move” each time they are re-
faced ; why. then, should Australian timbers,
if they are handled properly?
“Masarcus”: They’re after the Ford
Motor Co. in the land of the wooden nut-
meg. and a press campaign is in full scorch.
This sort of piffle: “Why is a Ford like a
rich woman’s baby?” “Because it has a
new rattle every day.” The eel behind the
rock is that the Ford co. is a near approach
to wholehog Sosh. No employee is paid less
than five dollars a day, and a pyramid of
the nrofits is whacked up amongst all hands.
Fellow-manufacturers have for Ford the
same benevolent feelings that the unionist
has for the scab. He’s a puzzle to them:
they can’t make out for sure whether ho is
a crank or a longer-headed business man
than all the rest of them. Considering the
terms he offers compared with what they
offer, they are sure he’s a crank (he
mixes some religion with it) ; and when
they look at the money he is making some
of them reckon lie’s merely on to the best
advertising scheme of his day.
*■* * *
“Warre,”. after going through the wheat
belt.: —-
Though the N.S.W. Government is out again with
the same old tale of making preparations for the re-
moval of wheat from country stations to the sea-
board, wayback bookmakers are offering a quid to a
quondong that the same old breakdown will arrive at
the same old address, and hundreds of thousands of
bags of wheat will have to be dumped just anywhere.
A record yield is a practical certainty, and it’s up to
someone to find out from the Minister of Railsvays
just how many locomotives are out of action, and
why. Nothing so far has been done at country
stations to meet the inevitable rush of grain just
after the New Year, the stacking sites are quite
inadequate, and there is nothing like sufficient dun-
nage to meet requirements.
* * * *
“Ritasun” : Hundreds of bundles offruit-
treelings have been coming into the irriga-
tion country of Northern Victoria, and there
is a golden promise that the Australian
housewife will soon no longer have to look
upon dried fruits as a luxury. At Is. 4d.
per lb. these goods are twice too dear, and
the “corner” in the Mildura and Renmark
output is doomed. Thousands of citrus
fruit trees are already in bearing—slightly
only, since the strength of the trees is being
wisely nursed —and the question already
arises as to where all the Washington Navel
oranges will go when the full harvest is
ready.
“W.C.M.”: About co-operative flour-mill-
ing (B. 19/8/M5). A tremendous amount of
prejudice will have to be overcome if the
wheat cockv is built on the same lines as his
brother who minds the sheep. A few years
ago, in a sheep district, I found that each
farmer shore his own little lot, baled his
wool, and had it sold separately. I preached
co-operation—one large shed, one lot of cart-
age, one big lot sold in place of a dozen small
lots. I spent a good deal of time over the
scheme, and every farmer could see its
advantages. But they remembered. Some
years before there had been a scheme for a co-
operative freezing works. It wasn’t a success,
because each shareholder wanted to get Svd-
ney prices in the country. So the concern
closed down, and each man lost a tenner or
so. That hurt, and co-operation has been
shied at ever since. The cocky can’t see fur-
ther ahead than yesterday, and sometimes it
is tlie day before.
"P.X.”: Writing about the Post Office
The Bulletin said the other day that pub-
lic enterprises wouldn’t run themselves any
more than private enterprises. In a small
way Bundaberg has just provided another
example. Private Enterprise having proved
a cormorant in the local meat trade, a Citi-
zens Defence Committee was formed to buy
carcases and sell them. After trading tor
six weeks with apparent success this com-
mittee transferred the business to the Bunda-
berg Co-operative Butchering Co., Ltd.
Now. after about 10 months, this co. finds
that it has used up all its capital and has
to go into liquidation. When it was too
late an auditor was called in, and lie found
that instead of making a profit the Defence
Committee had actually made a loss of !•>
a week. Subsequently things went on m the
same old slipshod way, and nobody seems to
have known that the concern was rushing to
the Devil until it had actually got there.
* * * *
Sydney Banco Court heard another dis-
pute about onions the other day, the quarrel
concerning a consignment shipped from
Japan in a German boat. The transaction
was interrupted bv the war, and the cargo
had to be landed and stored in Japan until
another ship could be found to briiv it
along. The vegetables were alleged by the
defendants to have arrived “unfit for human
consumption”—in fact, “quite unfit tor
human consumption.” They ought to have
been good enough to bring tears to the eyes
of patriotic Australians, anyhow.
The promoters of a “patriotic” Art Lnion
in Adelaide have just played a grim joke on
the subscribers. The lucky holder _of the
first-prize ticket received a large Marie Tuck
painting, valued at a complimentary figure.
The poor unfortunate who took second place
had to be content with a mere Argyle motor-
cai'! *
“Parisine”: Among the champion mean
men keep a place-for Romagosa, a well-
known Madrid miser, who died a few months
ago. leaving a fortune valued at six millions
sterling. His will bequeaths nearly all. m
equal shares, to the Bishops of Madrid.
Barcelona and Buenos Ayres. His wife, a
miser too, disputes the bequests. Appar-
entlv he played a Brobdingmudan joke on
her. like San Francisco’s millionaire, Jim
Lick, who left everything for a big tcle-
scone through which his hungry relatives
might look for him in Heaven.
NEAR BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne publicans are asking for a new drink
to serve after hours. They want something “near
beer” —something that will meet the need of their
ordinary customers, and yet be in strict accord with
the new Licensing Act.
There is a feverish demand
For some good, simple drink to-day;
'Tis felt throughout the thirsting land.
Oh, have you such a liquor, say—
A soothing cup that maketh gay
The heart of man, and gives him cheer;
A drink that is, and isn’t, beer?
A booze we want possessing nip—■
A new, exalted, temp’ranee swipe
That passes o’er the eager lip
Like velvet rum to make us ripe.
Yet keeps us from the Lemon’s gripe;
A drink for dinner, supper, lunch,
Which, though teetotal, has a punch.
So near to beer it ought to be
That it will warm the bosom’s core
And not disgrace the devotee.
The three big moons that shone of yore
’Twill to all merry men restore,
While they roll home with roaring song,
A sedulously sober throng.
We want a drink with which, in fact,
We can absorb the spirit quite,
Yet keep the letter of the- Act —
A lotion that is Itechabite,
Yet prone to make us think we’re tight
When we are not; preserving, hence,
A saving legal difference.
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
THE GAMBLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The gamble that we christen Life
Plays many a curious prank.
Thus of it spoke a careworn man
Of aspect drear and dank:
“Our life is but a lottery,
And I have drawn a blank.”
But there’s another man I know,
Who languishes for naught,
In whom this tale of discontent
Impatient anger wrought:
“The prizes that the fool would win
Are scarcely worth a thought !”
But I am in this gamble, too,
And neither fat nor thin:
I never think that I have lost.
But stay, with cheerful grin.
To gamble for the gamble's sake
Without a hope to win.

“Blanky” : The Egyptian coinage is
guaranteed to box the Australian for a
while although it is so simple. There are
10 millimes to a piastre, and one hundred
piastres to the Egyptian pound. A piastre
is worth 2-id., and is a nickel coin about
the size of ~ a bob or deener, and the half
piastre is a little smaller. Then the two-
piastre is silver, about as big as sixpence,
The next is five, then 10, then 20. The
twenty is like the old ss. piece, It takes a
while to remember that a piastre is 2*d.

m . . ~ . , „
1 raining as it is done now m Egypt:
Our camp is a well-arranged turn-out. We have
a lar «e wooden mess-room for each company, so we
don t have to eat our meals in the tents as we did
m Australia. Each battalion has a wet canteen, a
dry canteen, tobacconist and barber. We do all our
drill from 6 till «o a.m. and from 5 till 7 p.m., and
we have a lecture in the mess-room from 11 a.m.
to 12.15 p.m., so we are not worked during the hot
part of the day. The parade ground is a desert.
Bill this desert isn't all sand. There’s nldre gravel
and dust than anything else, and ambling over it is
no joke; but taking everything into consideiation
we’re not badly treated, and are getting well trained
without being overworked. We’ve got out of the
clothes we landed in. Our everyday dress is boots,
puttees, shorts, light shirt and felt hat. Shorts are
pants reaching a little above the knees, and are
made of light khaki drill. There are pith helmets
ready for us, and soon we will all be wearing them
instead of felt hats.
“E.N.M.”: Some weeks ago, between Ben-
rith and Emu Plains (N.S.W.), 1 counted
n i lle men putting up a. small telegraph-post.
It took them the best part of two “work-
ing” days. Now, in the Brisbane Courier,
an indignant taxpayer writes concerning
another telegraph-post—this time outside
hN house His storv •
Six nieri> ' two horses, * a'dray and a wheelbarrow
were recently engaged in replacing a telephone-post
(two wires) with an inferior one. I know of no
reason for the substitution. The time occupied was
over two days, and in the aggregate 104 hours, and
the expense, at Is. per hour, £5 4s. Two men
could easily do the job in half an hotir.
Yet the Postal Department faces half-mil-
lion deficits not only without If'.tremor, but
without murmuring an apology. Is it any
wonder that, with leeches dragging at its
veins, such as Cockatoo Dock. Canberra
and the awful Postal Department, the
young Commonwealth is becoming finan-
ciallv anaemic?
“Corporal Slump”: The rifle clubs are one
of the few humorous features of the war. Being
a married man with a flock of young children
1 enrolled myself amongst the. stay-home
heroes shortly after the outbreak of trouble.
One of the first things that struck me about
the parades was the number of hale, single
young men who were standing shoulder to
shoulder with us broken-winded suburbanites
and ignoring the call for recruits. However,
most of these young men gradually became
aware of the national clamor for real work-
ing soldiers and faded away to camp amid
applause from the club, which cheerfully took
credit to itself for discovering a few more
expeditionaries for the Front, whereas all it
had really done was to provide several young
men with a harbor of refuge for a few weeks.
After the clearance, some too-enthusiastie
fusilier started to worry his elubmates into a
uniform which cost 255. complete with hat,
and looked shocking. One or two objected to
the slopshop-sweating indicated by the low
price, and a heap more stormed against the
utter shapelessness of the outfit. Just about
then the membership rot set in, and the bi-
weekly roll-cqll became a sad function. The
position at present is that the young shirkers
(who now regard the refuge as useless,
and are determined to shirk to the end) can-
not resign, and the clubs haven’t the power to
throw them out. No doubt the regulations
will be amended in time and the moral wreck-
age pushed off the rolls; but for the present
the wheezing veterans on parade have to
throw out their stomachs and listen indig-
nantly while the corporal under the lamp
yelps the hated names of the wilful missing.
“E.N.M.”: Perhaps it is the enervating
Northern climate, but even if it is only the
Northern beer the fact remains that the
Light Horse camp at Chermside (Q.) can
show, relatively, an extraordinary number
of big fellows in khaki. It is ridiculous to
call these sons of Anak “Light Horse.”
Some of them run up to 6ft. 4in. and 6ft.
Sin. in their socks, and ride at 15 or 16
stone. Why don’t the Defence authorities
draft out these giants and form the Aus-
tralian Lifeguards? A couple of thousand
picked men and horses would help to para-
lyse the gentle Uhlans in the European
spring of 31)16. And how they would make
the name of Australia ring!
Brisbane Bung, who fought several Home
Secretaries bitterly for years on the
Sunday-trading question, is now the strict-
est of Sabbatarian observers. Indeed, the
Brisbane police report that a Sunday sl.v-
grog traffic has sprung into existence ns a
result of Boniface’s bigoted objection to wet
even a legitimate pewter on Sunuay, and
they begin to wish he wouldn’t be so par-
ticular.


THE FOLEY OF TAKING DIGESTIVE
PILLS.
A WARNING TO DYSPEPTICS.
The habit of taking digestive pills after
meals makes chronic? dyspeptics of many
thousands of men and women because arti-
ficial digestants, drugs and medicines have
practically no influence upon the excessively
acid condition of the stomach contents which
alone is the cause of most forms of indiges-
tion and dyspepsia. The after-dinner pill
merely lessens the sensitiveness of the
stomach nerves, and thus gives a false sense
of freedom from pain, whereas if those who
are subject to flatulence, heartburn, wind,
etc., were to obtain a little pure bis lira ted
magnesia from the chemist and take half a
teaspoonful in a little water after meals
there would be no necessity for drugs or medi-
cines because Msurated magnesia instantly
neutralises acidity, stops food fermentation,
and thus ensures normal painless digestion
by enabling the stomach to do its work with-
out hindrance.*
IF CONSTIPATED TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYROP OF FIGS.
Delicious “regulator” for stomach,
liver and bowels, for mamma,
daddy, and children.
If you are headachy, constipated, bilious,
or if th(> stomach is disordered and you want
to enjoy the nicest liver and bowel cleansing
you ever experienced, take a tablespoonful
of “California Syrup of Figs” to-night and
in the morning all the constipation poison,
bile and clogged-up waste will gently move
out of the system without griping, and you
will feel splendid.
Every member of the family should use this
fruit laxative as occasion demands. It is
just as effective for grandpa as it is for baby.
It simply cannot injure. Even cross, sick.
feverish children just love its pleasant taste
and mothers can rest easy after giving it,
because it never fails to effect a good “inside
cleansing.'’
For thirty years “California Syrup of
Figs” has been recommended by physicians
as the ideal stomach, liver and bowel
cleanser. Millions of families who are well
informed use" nothing else.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of "Califor-
nia Syrup of Figs,” which has full directions
for babies, children of all ages and for grown-
ups plainly printed on the bottle. Beware
of counterfeits sold here. Get the genuine,
made by “California Fig Syrup Company.”
Itefuse any other kind with contemot. “Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs” is sijld by all leading
chemists, 1/14 and 1/9.
WORM
NINE INCHES LONG, AND THREE
OTHERS, EXPELLED BY COM-
STOCK’S ‘DEAD SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
“It is purely gratitude that has prompted
me to write these few lines of the grand
results I had received from using your
Worm Pellets,” writes Mrs. Audrey Neale,
of 41 Richmond Avenue, Grey Lynn. Auck-
land, N.Z. “My little boy Harold, four years
old, was suffering terribly from worms, and
lie gave us a lot of worry and anxiety and
much loss of sleep. We tried a lot of home
remedies kindly given by friends as sure
remedies; and also we tried a lot of duly-
qualified remedies, but they were all with-
out success. An advertisement caught my
eye of Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pel-
lets, and I decided to give them a trial, and
I can assure you the result was wonderful
and brought a lot of cheerfulness into the
house again. The first dose I gave him he
passed a worm nine inches long, and three
smaller ones after the second dose, and since
then he has been a different boy altogether
and has not been troubled with worms since.
You are welcome to use this testimony as
you please.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation for
the eradication of worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers. Price 3s. Gd. per packet; or will
be sent post paid at the same price by The

POLITICAL
POINTS
Emissaries from Japan who have been
visiting Maoriland state that direct steamers
will soon be running from Kobe to Welling-
ton. there having been a large increase of
orders for goods to take the place of con-
signments previously bought in Germany. .So
THE SOFT ANSWER.
REJECTED CANDIDATE: “Well, by heavens,
I'll never allow myself to be nominated
again without first submitting myself to
two brain specialists.”
BRUTAL FRIEND: “But why delay?”
everything will be all right. Haven’t Massey
and Ward put a 50 per cent, tax on German
goods to make the doddering Dominion self-
reliant? They might as well have put a
mustard plaster on the local volcano.
"Harrison O.” : Imagine my astonishment:
•he other day when, drowsing over the
Argus, I came across the following:—
The present discontent in the ranks of the State
Liberal party is clue chiefly to the irrational and anti-
quated method bv which the Cabinet is constituted.
The idea of entrusting to one man—the leader of the
party-—the task of deciding who shall conduct tlie
business of the country, and denying- to the party as
a whole any voice in the matter, is essentially un-
democratic in theory and has never been justified in
practice. Tlie reasonable method is for the party to
meet in conference and select from among its mem-
bers those whom it considers best fitted and most
entitled to Ministerial rank. The time is ripe for
tlie abandonment of the system at present in vogue,
which places too much power in the hands of a single
individual, and lias the effect of causing dissatisfac-
tion amongst the rank and file of the party.
Upon looking again I find that the above
were not the Argus’s exact words. Still
•hey are near enough. What the old lady
actually did say was: —
There is a strong feeling in the party that the
best method of establishing a Ministry which will
possess the confidence of the party is for the party to
choose the members who are to administer the vari-
ous departments. Such a method, although not in
accordance with Parliamentary traditions, would at
any rate, etc., etc. Neither is it a violation of the
party system of government, because Ministers would
he chosen only by and from members of the penlomi-
nant party in the House.
Now that tlie Argus has bestowed her bless-
ing upon the caucus system, it is no doubt
only a matter of time before she will demand
that no non-unionist shall be allowed to
hold office, and that any measure thrown.out
by the Legislative Council shall at once
automatically become law.
ENLIGHTENMENT.
HIM: "Gad, that Census card's got me beat!
What else coaid a fellow do, the johnny
wants to know.”
HER: “Well, you could say that you might
get work, couldn’t you?”
“No compulsion!” Professor Ronald
Mclntyre, of the Sydney Scotclibyterians,
cackles. "Shall it be said that we can’t
defend our country of our own free will?”
Shall it lie said that we had to make a tax
to pay our war debts’? Shall it be said
that, when our country wanted money, it
had to compel people to pay? Away with
such nonsense ! Let Andrew Fisher merely
announce that the Treasury will oe open
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.fh. on Mondays and
Thursdays, and all this stupid system ox
postage-stamps, Customs Houses, land and
income taxes, etc., can safely be swept away.
The dreadful result of bringing the parson
up on a collection plate seems to be that he
thinks everybody else ought to depend on
the same deplorable system of cadge.
“E.N.M.” : Where are we going? To say
that butter shall be sold at Is. sd. per lb.
when it is costing Is. 9d. to produce, and
when there are thousands of people able and
willing and even anxious to pay 2s. Gd. for
it, is a folly so stupendous that only a corpse
couldn’t see it. The making of a law or
regulation to achieve this maniacal scheme
proves that the legislators responsible are
either the prize fools of civilisation or the
most dishonest gang of political frauds ever
spawned by the devil of Party. Such a law
—and the same thing applies to wheat or
milk or meat or anything else—is a direct
incitement to the public to co-operate
promptly in breaking it. And accordingly
broken it is. amid the enthusiastic silence of
all concerned, and the Law passes further
into contempt. Which is bad for the Law
and worse for the people, since disrespect for
Law means in the end defiance of authority
—and anarchy lies along that road.
TURKEY’S “S.O.S.”
“Somewhere a voice is calling.”
To the German mind the position in Eng-
land must be beyond all understanding. The
Trade Union Congress resolved that “Prus-
sian militarism must be destroyed” ; also it
recorded “hearty appreciation of the magni-
ficent response to the call for volunteers to
light Prussian militarism.” Yet, while
enthusiastically in favor of voluntary mili-
tary effort, it unanimously carried a reso-
lution against eonscriptive effort to do the
thing that it is so much in favor or naving
done. What the trade-union worker wants
is freedom—freedom to encourage the bolder
to go and do what ought to be done, while
the other sort stays at home and gets the
benefit of higher wages. In industrial mat-
ters they call this sort “scabs” and have a
contempt for him. But in this national
matter they are prepared to go out on strike
for tlie l ight of every man to be a scab.”
On the principle of rectifying a quarrel
with Brown by hitting Smith, the night-
shift miners in several South Coast
(N.S.W.) collieries struck work recently—
and won. The grievance was that the
miners, many of whom live at Wollongong,
left work at 10.30 pan., but the railways
only provided a leisurely train which fre-
quently did not get them home till 3 a.m.
They had, they alleged, no means of shaking-
up Brown, the Railway Commissioner, so
they took it out of Smith, the mine-
owner, by refusing to work. And" Smith,
having influence with Brown, promptly
got the grievance redressed; the Commis-
sioners announced, almost immediately, that
a suitable train would be run for the miners’
benefit. The incident serves to show that
the idea of hitting Smith for Brown's
offence is not a had one in a partly-civilised
community. In a wholly-civilised commu-
nity the idea would of course he prepos-
terous. And the idea of knocking off work
to get a little grievance like this put right
ought to be more preposterous than ever
with the Government in the hands of the
workers.
Having undertaken to spend £400.000 in
making that picturesque ditch, the Tamar,
navigable for ships of the Ceramic class or
thereabouts, the Launceston (Tas.) Marine
Board now finds itself in a financial moss,
and has asked the State Government to give
it £lOO.OOO towards what it calls a national
work. The Government is in very low
water itself these days, but it is going to ask
Parliament to put up £40,000 to clear the
rocks away from the mouth of the ditch, on
condition that the Marine Board drops as
much of its scheme as it can. and goes slow
on the rest.
The power of the Federal Parliament to
insist upon fair labor conditions in return
for the payment of bounty for the encourage-
ment of an industry is to be tested. Doubt
as to the existence -of the power having-
arisen in consequence of a judgment of the
Full Court in Rex. v. Barger, Minister for
Customs Tudor asked Justice Higgins in the
Arbitration Court to say what wages and
conditions were reasonable to be paid by
Hoskins, Ltd., who had claimed a bonus
under the Iron Bounty Act. Higgins for-
mally refused to make a decision, remarking
that, though lie had dissented from the
judgment in the Barger matter, he was
hound by it. So the matter goes to the Full
Court; and if the Full Court says the Com-
monwealth hasn’t the power to fix wages,
labor conditions, etc., in bonused industries,
then the principle of bonuses must go over-
hoard—-until the Constitution is altered. A
Constitution which strikes at the very root
of what is called the New Protection, but is
really The Bulletin’s old Protection, would
bo no good for-the year 1915.
By the way members are talking it look.t
a sure thing that the .Maori la ml picture show
and theatre ticket will have to bear a war
tax. The man who is getting fat on the
unearned increment of land values cordially
approves of this. Any rotten old port in a
storm, so far as he is concerned.
While the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor
party was writhing in agony over the Minis-
terial dole of £40.(100 to the Great Cobar Co.,
Speaker "Dick" Meagher entered his protest
—that “the deal savored of giving assistance
to Private ■ Enterprise.” It must have been
a moving moment.
Two items from one of last week’s daily
papers :
The steamer Clan McTavish lias arrived with 4000
tons ot maize and 1000 tons of rails.
An extra service has been inaugurated with Japan
and the first of the steamers arrived in Sydney with
holds crammed to the deck —4000 tons of goods,
comprising cement, salmon, sulphur, cane-ware,
silk, etc.
In adjoining columns were details about
(11 thousands of Newcastle miners threaten-
ing a strike; (2) a project for spending
public money to buy out landlords in order
.that work may be “available” for returned
soldiers; (3) the spectre of unemployment;
(4) loans to relieve threatened distress. All
of which moves The Bulletin to propose
three cheers on general principles and that
everybody take a day off.
Whilst Lloyd George last week was ex-
horting Britain to realise the necessity for
national service and show “grip, resolu-
tion and prompt readiness in every sphere.”
Prime Minister Asquith was assuring the
Commons that “the matter of compulsion
had not escaped the attention of the Gov-
ernment.” When the Zeppelins begin to
drop bombs around Westminster, Asquilh
will arise and say: “Hr. Speaker, the atten-
tion of the Government having been drawn
to the fact that hos'ile airships are drop-
ping explosives in the vicinity of this
House, I beg to move that this House do
now .adjourn.” Then the roof will fall in.
and Mr. Asquith, immediately previous to
his decease from asphyxiation, will murmur
a few words of regret that i’arliamentary
forms have not been observed.
CRIESUS DOES HIE DUTY.
"Gimme a wealth card, please.”
The Licensed Victuallers’ Association of
S. Aus. admits that six o’clock closing must
come. Naturally some of the members are
bitter about it, and one official wants to know
“what sort of a row they would make if a
referendum were demanded on the question
whether the parson was wanted or not.” “If
anything had happened to show that religion
was a failure it was the present war,” he
added, savagely.
FITZG[?]ZZLE. M.P.: HIS APOTHEOSIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The f'inih stood around the bed.
And nil the usual things they said
Ju whispers, as they mostly do
When brave King Death litis work to do.
They watched as, whimpering in his sloop,
Fitz Guzzle died. They didn’t weep.
Reporters wrote, 'mid noise and chaff,
Each his obsequious paragraph :
But folks said, "It's no loss, maybe ;
He was an average M.P.,”
And with regrets no tears were blent
lly anyone in Parliament.
(“It would he fine,” one cynic sighed,
“If all the fat Fitz Guzzles died!")
The widow had a slight attack
Of nerves, then robed herself in black ;
The mourning, in the latest style,
Gave her great comfort all the while.
And all the while, discarded clay,
FitzGuzzle’s empty body lay,
And did not seem to care a jot
For any mourner of the lot;
And so, with ritual void of wit,
They took it up and buried it.
They buried it one afternoon
With solemn pomp, and not too soon.
The farce was played, the game was done,
FitzGuzzle's earthly race was run.
Released from mortal toys and jars
I (is soul sped 'mid contemptuous stars
Into the vasts of outer space,
Which is a very lonely place.
His soul—that sort of man was he—
Was half the size of half a pea,
A very tiny, shapeless thing—-
You’d not expect the-stars to sing.-
Tlie soul sped through the dark, and whined
Its anguish sore, dismayed to find
Itself, a thing so mean and wee,
Adrift in cold eternity.
And then, with eyes of lambent flame,
A splendid pitying angel came,
Took up the soul and stopped its wails,
Cracked it between his finger-nails,
And said: “It's queer, without a doubt,
llow such poor insects get about.”
The angel, pondering this puzzle,
To nothingness reduced Fitz Guzzle.
He’s gone. Let men take heart, because
Ho is as if he never was.

NOTIONS
Undeterred by the cropper they came over
him in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick, punters
rushed the Hooks for Woorak in the Spring Stakes
at Rosehill on Saturday like hungry schnapper after
a prawn. It came off all right at 2 to 1 on, the
unreliable chestnut winning from end to end by half
a dozen lengths. In consequence of this win, in a
rather moderate-quality field, Woorak was pushed
back again into place of favorite for the Epsom Han-
dicap at a price which acquits the Chosen of deliber-
ate intention to squander their substance before the
war is over. Woorak is, of course, a brilliant track
performer—one of the most perfect gallopers seen in
Australia for many a year. But he doesn’t like
moving under pressure. If there had been anything
to tackle him at Rosehill the good thing would, in
all probability, have gone down with the same old
thyd as it has before ; and if there is a dispute in
progress at the business end of the Epsom, then the
rich mile is not for Woorak. At Rosehill he was
allowed to run on at his own clip—the only way to
ride a horse of this type—and he stayed in front the
whole way. He is a horse of quite exceptional pace,
but to back him at a short price in first-class com-
pany is to take a risk which nothing- in his record
will justify. The running at Rosehill of Lardner
in the Rydalmere Mile and First Principle in the
Camellia Stakes—won by the unbacked Orrtato with
a featherweight up—was quite as impressive as
Woorak’s exercise gallop in the Stakes.

The Derby favorite, Wallace Isinglass, has fur-
nished into a fine, handsome colt who will gallon
generously over a distance. He took the Rosehill
Guineas like a tradesman after a desperate finish
with Cetinge. On this running the son of Wallace
will be desperately hard to beat in the race for
three-year-olds next month. Blocked by Cetinge on the
rails, the colt had to be pulled out into the course
a furlong from home, thus losing a good two lengths.
To win under those circumstances was a remarkably
good performance, especially after getting nearly the
worst of a scrambling start. But on the strength
of it to chase the odds merchant for a share in
closely-clipped quotations' for the Melbourne Cup, as
many deluded punters have done, requires amazing-
faith.
The Bulletin was directing- attention the other-
week to William the Silent (6st. 121 b.) as an un-
obtrusive .animal which might be found taking part
in the argument about the Metropolitan Handicap.
It doesn’t feel called upon to make any further-
remark about the excessively quiet prad "just now
beyond observing that in the Rosehill Handicap with
fst. 41b. nothing- had a chance with him except
St. Cgrwynne, who turned up the job in disgust and
reckoned second money quite good enough, to the
great satisfaction of the Bar Vorrs.
Punters who got the long prices about
William the Silent for the Metrop. are likely to be
err good terms with themselves when the barrier rises,
though they are not bound to have to collect when
the numbers go up. After his Rosehill Cup victory
William looks a pretty good thing for the 12 furlongs
race. Not as good a thing as Wallace Isinglass for
the A.J.C. Derby, but a splendidly healthy proposi-
tion for anyone who got 50 to 1 about the imported
horse five weeks ago.
“Evens”: As the A.J.C. meeting draws
nearer the sporting columns of the Sydney news-
papers make more frantic efforts to indicate to the
punting community the betting odds obtainable
against probable starters for the big handicaps and
Derby, while keeping- clear of the law which pro-
hibits the publication of the odds. T suggest to
them the algebraic system— -'a system of equine equa-
tions, so to speak. F’rinstanee, “Carlin’s price- for
the Metrepsom is a third of that of First Principle’s.
When each is three points shorter the latter’s figure
will be six times the former’s. This may seem
abstruse, but any schoolboy could answer it in half
a minute. Besides showing due respect for the law
1 his system would provide gentle mental exercise for
a very deserving class prone to neglect its mathe-
matics, and at the same time afford them invaluable
information about their fancies.
An unusual thing happened at Tattersall’s
race-meeting in Adelaide. The third money in a
steeplechase was not claimed. There were only three
starters, and one of them, at the first fence, explained
courteously but firmly that there had been some mis-
take- he understood he had been engaged for a flat
race. He argued the point until the race had been
finished for some time, and then he was ridden off.

lhere has been much talk in Maoriland as
to how C. G. Dalgety’s Martian-Lady Disdain three
year-old gelding Snub would shape when tried in a
real race. It was known that he is regarded by his
owner as being the next string in the stable to War-
step ; and the fact that lie’s half-brother to the
wonderful mare that shook' all Maoriland up las-
season added interest to the speculation. Snub made
his first appearance the other day in the Braemar
Handicap at Ashburton, and landed the bacon by a
neck. He looks like a money-gatherer, and a lot
ot people who know nothing about it are beginnim-
to say “I told you so.”

“Moana”: Apropos recent jockey-scales
swindles. ' There is a scale-manufacturing firm in
Christchurch (M.L.) controlling a valuable local
patent under which lever-scales without any springs
ear, he made. This firm has for years been turning
out a machine that hangs from the ceiling- of the
weighing-room, and gives the weight of the horse-
pjot on a dial. As the chair is open all round and
underneath, the scale .cannot be rigged by getting at
it through floor or walls. The improvement is in
use in different parts of Loan Land, but it isn’t
being rushed as it should be, probably because it is
a local product, and hasn't been dragged from Berlin
or Yokohama or some such place.
N.S.W. Trotting Club is expanding. Last
year £4987 was given in prize-money at 14 meet-
ings in the Metropolis, a rise of £lB4l on the pre-
vious year’s figures. Throughout the State 147
affiliated clubs keep the pastime, business, felony,
or whatever it is, moving.

’Murkan Jimmy Clabby blew into Sydney
again the other day, and after announcing himself
fit and well, rushed off to get fitter. ITis first
engagement will be with Darcy, and if James has
brought along the assorted biffs and blocks he
carried with him on previous visits to this part
the argument between the two should be strenuous.
The more recent disturbances in which he took part
in the States didn’t put him any nearer the middle-
weight championship than he was before. But
James is a very accomplished boxer, all the same.

The punchings that Billy Murray has re-
ceived in Australia have done him no good, lie has
probably deteriorated 50 per cent, since leaving his
Yankee home, and the hiding he got, from McGoorty
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night was not the
sort to assist rejuvenation. In the first round he lost
his head, in the third his powers of resistance, in the
fourth his senses. McGoorty completed the massacre
with a clean knock-out to the chin. Murray had
climbed to the perpendicular as the count ended, but
it was quite a. while before lie knew what had hap-
pened. The man’s courage is wonderful, his indiffer-
ence to punishment amazing, his judgment deplorable,
lie fought the worst fight that could have been
imagined, completely reversing the methods be had
employed against Darcy a, couple of weeks before, and
playing right into McGoorty’s bands. He was as
wide open as a gate, and his hits were as slow as a
sermon. McGoorty was in rare good form, and had
an easy job. Against a slow boxer McGoorty is
deadly.
* * * *
A youth with a hefty light and a left of
direful possibilities has unearthed himself up in the
district Darcy comes from, and having’ scattered the
local talent and snuffed Les Gleeson out in a round
is to be stood up against Arthur Everdeu. If the
young gentleman makes good in that little un-
pleasantness he is expected to do further damage
shortly with more difficult material. Good judges
wiio have seen him speak of a very promising lad.
MACARTNEY, of N.S.W.
Featherweights Geikie and Togo Lyons

quarters before the twelfth collision had finished.
The towel saved him from oblivion. Stated that

Jack Clune was served up
McCoy at Melbourne on Saturday, In?k'previous dis-
turbance , between the pair at Sydney, Clune though
beaten leaped away from most of the trouble with
great agility. This time he couldn’t leap quickly
enough, and as an opponent who can neither hit nor
bound to safety is no use against McCoy, the mis-
guided Clune got it in the neck ! with much severity.

How much longer is 'the gag about
McGoorty being a middleweight going to survive? lie
certainly is not one. On Saturday he was weighed
at Sydney Stadium at two o’clock, jyid registered 1 Ist.
7ilb.-r-a pound and a half over the' Australian middle-
weight limit. He went into the ring with Murray
at 8.30 p.m. every pound of 12st:5f5atB£h probably
a bit over—his real fighting weight, and one he cannot
go below without weakening. It is long odds that
McGoorty only once fought in Australia at the middle-
weight scale —that time he met Darcy—and the odds
are just as long that- he '’won’t, do it again against a
man who can hit. He is really a light-heavyweight
wno has been boxing out of his class, and thus getting
an unfair advantage. Anyhow, this business of weigli-
mg-in (half a day before the scrap takes place is clear
humbug. The place for the pug- to be weighed is on
the spot when he arrives to deliver himself and the
goods.

The absolute, last, decisive, grand final of
lie. League football for this season, oil the Metro-
politan Cricket Ground, Melbourne, was a moment-
ous circumstance. In brilliant weather Carlton and
Colling wood faced each other with their best teams
Bines winning the toss had the advantage of the
breeze, and at the first change they had to credit
23 points to ’Wood’s 12. In the second term they
stuck to their lead, and it looked as if ’Wood's sys-
tematic play would not prevail against Carlton’s
well-planned rushes. But the third quarter brought
a change. The Magpies took full control of the
game, and methodically piled on points till, just after
entering the last quarter, a hard-earned goal gave
them the lead. Unfortunately for their hopes the
continued effort had been too great; Carlton’s coun-
ter-attack yielded two goals and then the Magpies
collapsed, and the Blues ran out winners by 78
points to ’Wood’s 45. Thus Carlton retained the
premiership and gained their eleventh pennant. The
attendance (39,211) was ahead of last year’s 30,495,
though both crowd and “gate,” £1409, were far
below the “grand final” record of ’l3, when the
meeting of Fitzroy and St. Kilda attracted 59,550
spectators, equal to a £2308 “house.”
“The Recruiting Sergeant”: The fine-old
traditions of our forefathers are not to be suffered
to die out! Waterloo was won on the playing fields
of Eton, and if Gallipoli is not lost on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground it will be no fault of those who
bellow and blurt round an arena far more glorious
in their eyes than that in which , red-eyed, sleepless
men in dirty trenches stand up for a greater tradition
than sport, till maybe a Turkish bullet puts them out
of the great game for ever. On the morning of the
day when Carlton was to contest the football pre-
miership with Collingwood, the Magpies were nearly
knocked off their perch because two players, Rowan
and Seddon, in camp at Broadnteadows, had been
refused leave. The club secretary whirled out to
the camp in a motor-car. What he said is not
known, but the military potentate who had failed to
bow down to King Football relaxed his iron hand,
and the two players, who had taken-part in a 10-mile
march that morning, were rushed back to town in
time to take their places in the playing field. The
result of the match was cheered to the echo, and.
shook the Sultan on his throne. Over in Gallipoli
tired soldiers “spat buttons” from parched mouths,
grunted wearily, and took a fresh grip of their
scalding rifles as they settled anew to repel a charge
of ignorant heathens who had never heard of Colling-
wood, an 4 would probably burn it to the ground if

Rugby League football came to an end for
the season in Sydney on Saturday at the Agricultural
Ground yyith a duel between teams representing the
Metropolitan' and Northern districts. It was a fast
game, ajpt&hjk scores show —30 points to 26. The
home players won; but more by good luck than good
managemeift A wild pass by a Newcastle man in
the last few minutes lobbed into the arms of Frank
Burge, and with characteristic expedition that speed
machine was off. Nobody could pace with him, and
he plunked down the try between the goal posts, and
that try was all liis side needed. Only about 3000
spectators were on the ground to cheer his dash —a
poor outlook for the Newcastle League’s ground-pur-
chasing fund, for which the match was specially
arranged. On the other hand, whether a football
ground as a football ground will be an asset or an
alabaster elephant when the season of 1916 comes
round is a problem which may best be solved with
the two-up kip.
During the afternoon the Agricultural Ground
flags marked the loss of Major. Jim McManamey,
killed with so many other-tine Australians at Galli-
poli. No man ever had«the interests of football,
particularly the Rugby Union brand, more at heart
than he. A noted forward in his day, a referee keen,
quick and utterly impartial, and a sound adviser in
the councils of delegates, Janies McManamey’s name
will live in the traditions of the g'anie, at any rate,
on the east coast of Australia. lie couldn’t have
been more than a week or so in the great trouble
when death found him. Before the war, in his work-

“Wally” Messenger’s scoring ability put
him in a class by himself in N.S.W. Rugby League
this season. In premiership and City Cup matches
he got 88 points (six tries and 35 goals). A.
Bolewski (77), H. liorder (73), and F. Burge (72)
were next on the list. F. Burge’s collection of 24
tries, and A. Bolewski’s 37 goals were something to
set to music. W. Messenger is a brother of the
famous “Dally,” who made mighty piles of points
under both Union and League, bawigrs in two hemi-
spheres.

The most untamed game in N. S. Wales
on Saturday raged under the auspices and patronage
of the Rugby League at Bathurst. The joust,'shindy
or gunpowder-plot was between Bathurst and Hartley.
The legions of the Citj r of the Plains powdered the
miners in the western dust until their own points
were 36 while the stricken enemy’s were still nil.
But Hartley, like the Russian bear, was getting some
satisfaction for its run. Six of its men at that stage
had been ordered off the field for stoush and such
like, and the other seven then retired in a body to
lick their wounds and despatch a communique to the
effect that the fall of Hartley on the western front
would not permanently affect the campaign in that
theatre, and that ultimate victory was assured.
The final for the Gardiner Challenge Cup
drew a big crowd of Soccer enthusiasts to Sydney
University Oval on Saturday in the expectation of
an unusually strenuous battle between Balmain and
West Wallsend. Seven times the men of the water-
side have booted the State championship
home since the Cup was made its sign and manual
in 188 S ; but this year the strong play of the coun-
try team, particularly in the past couple of weeks,
had put the fear of Adam into Balmainiacs. They
might have spared themselves, however, for their
deputies won without exhausting their resources by
two goals to nil, one scored in each spell. In 27 finals
city teams have won 22, the remainder being gath-
ered by' Northern district reps. Southern district
clubs have yet to break the monotonj’ of defeat.
Paddington, winner in the Australian
Rulqs section of N.S.W. football, had a fine record
this season. In 17 matches (one lost) it scored 125
goals and 195 behinds (945 points) against 61 goals
56 behinds (422 points). It is Paddington’s first
premiership, and it made the thing quite decisive.
The Australian Rules League at Adelaide
has been playing off its semi-finals, and the surprise
packet has been Sturt, which walloped out South
Adelaide and West Adelaide on successive Saturdays.
The former team was cleaned up first by nine goals
six behinds (60 points) to four goals 12 behinds (36
points), and last Saturday West Adelaide went down
at the Oval by seven goals three behinds (45 points)
to two goals 13 behinds (25 points). Sturt, the
youngest team in the competition, will now meet
Port Adelaide in the challenge final, and great should
be the excitement thereof.

The first Maoriland toeballer to earn a
war decoration is Corporal C. W. Saunders, of
Dunedin. He is well remembered as five-eighths in
the first-grade team of the famous Pirates Club in
the Scawtch city in 1903. Being in Fogland when
the trouble with Bill Sauercabbage started he
promptly got to the Front, where he has been fight-
ing ever since. Now word drifts through that he
has been handed the D.C.M. for gallantry. He has a
brother with the M.L. Field Artillery at Gallipoli.

The Dunlop Rubber Co. puts the widest
of Australian commercial questions in narrow advt.
form: “Are foreign-made tyres to predominate in the
Commonwealth?” Just now the answer of. the right-
thinking Australian citizen is emphatically “No”;
but the question in the future will be answered only
by the tariff. No foreign anything that can be effici-
ently manufactured here will predominate in the local
market if the tariff gives patriotic encouragement to
the local article; and competition can be left to
ensure that the local producer will give the purchaser
a fair deal. It is just a questiou for the tariff.
Mariner Edward Jones, of Melbourne, dis-
claims credit for inventing the motor-car tyre now
manufactured by the Emergency Tyre Co. Captain
Pearse (of the Pastoralists’ Review) struck the idea
of making tyres with coeoanut fibre, and on the strength
thereof formed a co. in Sydney. But Capt. Pearse’s
invention was lacking in one essential, and eventually,
after 10 months’ experimenting, Jones invented the
joint, or splice, which was needed to make a commer-
cial success of it. lie then formed a co. to make and
sell the goods in Australia on a royalty to the Homing
Tyre Co., which has the disposal of the manufactur-
ing rights for foreign countries.

Tlie gluttonous crowds of the U.S.A. lick
their lips over the risks of motor-car speed races;
and one mob had a beautiful gorg-e last month at
lies Moines (Iowa) when in a 300-mile race Joe
Cooper was killed and his mechanist terribly in-
jured. Cooper was raging round the mile circuit
past thousands of spectators at the rate of 95 miles
an hour when one of his tyres blew out. The ear
leapt like chain-lightning over the outer edge of the
track and smashed in smithereens 20ft. away. The
same day, at the same show, another hell-fired car
came to grief and..killed , its driver, Morris Keeler,
and close-up settled his mechanist. “The accident
cast a gloom over the race,” says the New York
Times. A gloom ! ’Struth 1
The suggestion that Victoria and N.S.W.
, should carry out an inter-State cricket programme
this season for patriotic -purposes received scanty
support in N. S. Wales. The Vic. Association is
credited with fathering the proposal ; lint as it had
already been agreed that- inter-State cricket should
he flung up the idea had to he dropped. The trouble
is that the proposal came too late —like the immor-
talised pardon.
Cricket in N. S. Wales, which officially
commences on October 2, is likely to be at a very*
low ebb in all grades, particularly amongst the
juniors, wherein some districts have notified that they
will have the honor not to be represented at all owing
to heavy enlistment from their ranks. Amongst the
seniors University has informed the Association that
after the November examinations it may have to
withdraw entirely from the season’s programme.
Other clubs have appealed to old members who have
passed the military age to get into flannels again
and keep things moving until better days dawn and
the call to the suppler athlete is no longer from the
field of battle. As for the Association itself, it may
be confidently expected that if it finds the engage-
ments of the 1915-16 season interfering with recruit-
ing it will put the shutters up altogether. The posi-
tion is such that three grounds will not be of any use
to the Assoc, this season and four only partially so ;
many junior teams will be missing as well as third-
grade elevens from University, Leichhardt, Redfern,
North Sydney, Middle Harbor and Central Cumber-
land. So the cricketer appears to be doing his little
bit. Incidentally, in such play as takes place eight
balls to the over will be the order.
The first sailing race of the season took
place in Port Jackson on Saturday in the form of
an open-boat event jointly managed by Flying
Squadron and Sailing Club. Of the 14 boats that
spread themselves to the rattling S.S.E. breeze only
six were' thrashing along with it after the first round
of the triangle. Then there was boatmanship that
might well have brought old man Neptune out from
the cave where the three-star rum is pannikined out
by the mermaid with the coral in her hair. The six
were Golding (R. Beashel), Australia (Chris. .Webb),
Kismet (W. Dunn), Evelyn (IT. Green), Mavis (F.
W. Moppett) and Advance (IT. E. Thompson). They
finished in that order, Golding beating the Australian
champion boat by 25see., 32sec. separating second
and third proas, and one minute the third and fourth.
X.S.W. Great Public School champion-
ships brought out a string of excellent perform-
ances. The episode of the gathering was the wing-
clipping- of Sydney Grammar (which had held the
championship for an unbroken 19 years) by Sydney
C. of E. Grammar, although it was only by the
narrowest of margins—29 points to 28. It was a
rare tussle for the points between the sprinting
of S.G. and the hurdling, jumping and distance-
running of C.E.G. The nippiest individual perform-
ers were R. F. Cripps (Newington College), who
won 440yds. teams race, 220yds. championship, and
was second in 100yds. and 440vds. ; and R. S. Hol-
combe (C.E.G.), who defeated the striding Ludowici
and a host of others in 880yds. and one mile.
Another fine effort was a high jump of sft. Tjin.
by McKellar (T.S.C.) ; and the running of 100yds.
by Leadley (S.G.), in 10 2-sscc. —4yds. worse than
evens.

“Bias’’: The Sydney bowling world is
tackling an ancient problem again. Most of the
suburban clubs are numerically weak, and the
annual subs, aren’t enough to meet the heavy ex-
penses of a tip-top green. For a start the skilled
person who looks after the rinks is cut down to a
microscopic wage, and a screw is made up for him
from the shilling which every visitor on the green is
required by custom to pay for his game. The system
of cadge is peculiar to bowls. The obvious remedy
is to raise subs., but members won't stand this, as
.they foolishly prefer to pay 30s. on other greens than
another £1 a year on their own. The main objec-
tion is that in no game that wasn’t of Scotch origin
would a guest be asked for a bob a time, and as a
solution it is proposed that its collection be made
from the hosts and not the visitors. Though an
improvement, this will not be really satisfactory
cither to the clubs which will tax their match-players
to pay the wages of the caretaker, or to the caretaker
himself, who would much prefer a fixed salary
instead of the weekly collection of shillings. The
caretakers could form a union and appeal to the
Arbitration Court, but the small clubs threaten to
disband if saddled with an attendant at a living
wage.

8y “ KaUartah" Treatment
the Nose and Throat are
treated effectively with
Medicated Oxygen inhaled
direct to the afflicted mem•
branes.
** Kat-ar*ah** Treatment
has a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of
the body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause.
Are You a Victim of
CATARRH!
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into the bead and the
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the hearing is
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost constant, with
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose becomes so
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,
while the slimy secretions are forced back into the throat,
requiring almost continual hawkingand spitting to dislodge them.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of the breath becomes
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the sufferers,
and the disgust of all who come near them. Gradually the
mucous discharge finds its way into the internal organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or Catarrh of the Stomach, is
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes contaminated by
catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and these are
distributed through the body.
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or
systemic disease, and its effect upon the general health and
system is soon apparent —appetite and strength are gone, weight
is lost, despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
“Kat-ar-ali” Inhalant
FREE.
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-
ar-ah ” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain
valuable medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in *ts influence on the
mucous membrane. It has a distinctly soothing, healing and sero-sanative
effect,sufficient todisintegrateand dislodgetheslimy nun ous accumulations.
“Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are
simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after
beginning its use. It quickly takes up its work of killing the disease
germs, of minimising and eventually stopping the discomforting mucous
discharges in .he nose and throat —mucous that is finding its way into
your stomach and poisoning your system.
I will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant hREE OF
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with
3d. in stam >s to cover cost of postage. Write address plainly, state
whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, and be sure to mention this paper. Send

“E.N.M.” : A new version of an old play
is in preparation. It is to be called “Our
American Cousin-German.’’
A while ago the Independent Theatre,
London, offered a prize for an “All British”
light- or comic-opera libretto. The compe-
titors were requested to send their manu-
scripts to •). T. Groin, dramatic critic, who
is one of live judges chosen for the competi-
tion. Another of the five is Herman Klein,
also musical critic. Groin and Klein, all-
British !
“Harrison O.”: Excusing Australian
managers for glutting the market with
Yankee dramatic goods, “C. Ockney” (B.
9/9/’lb) remarks: “I don’t think the man-
agements are blamable. The English drama
was dead long before the war, and by latest
reports it is still dead and likely to remain
so.” He proceeds to mention several Eng-
lish plays that failed in London during the
last theatrical season. Apart from the obvious
unfairness of quoting war-time failures, the
writer calmly assumes that the voice of the
Cockney is the voice of God, and that the
reception of a play here will merely dupli-
cate its London experience. This, of
course,.is not so. But, even accepting
“Ockney’s” assumption tlial what goes in the
Fog will go here, consider the number of
London successes of recent years that are
practically unknown in these parts. “His
House In Order” was Pinero’s biggest hit
since “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” (and a
better play) : but apart from a production
by Hugh Buckler Australia knows it not;
and the same applies (putting aside Reper-
tory productions) to Arnold Bennett’s “The
Great Adventure.” “Jack Straw,” “John
Chilcote, M.P.,” “Drake” and “Hindle
Wakes” are London booms that have been
enthusiastically ignored by leading Austra-
lian managements. “Ockney” is a poor
apologist for these pushers of Yankee “lines”
when he can urge nothing more convincing
in their justification than the old gag that
English drama is dead. From what I have
seen of Amurkan productions, a Yankee
dramatist worth Considering has not yet
been born.
“Kodak,” after feeding his Soul: —
A friend took me to a really high-grade recital the
other evening. Like everybody else I always tell
people I am fond of good music; but I notice 1
never spend coin to hear it, and that makes me
wonder whether I really am musical. Immediately
we got inside we found ourselves amongst the worried
sort of people who pay real money to frequent these
things. There wasn't one jolly-looking person in
sight. The chief performer scorned to saw off any-
thing which had a suspicion of melody about it. 1
was told that he was not out to supply vulgar enter-
tainment, but to pump up Souls and raise the artis-
tic hair of Sydney. If the good work can be accom-
plished by playing things like Parliamentary debates
and mathematical problems, that missionary is going
to accomplish the trick some time. All I know is I
listened to him until he stopped work for the night,
and then came away with disconnected piano-notes
(those high, clear ones like ice chips) sliding coldly
down my neck and my pocket full of violin screams.
Maybe it is only a sign that my neglected Soul is
stirring, but I invariably emerge from these func-
tions feeling as if I had been thrown from the top
of an iceberg, and had my teeth filed, and been
hosed with red-hot needles and forced to swim three
miles through a wind-lashed sea of old feather dust-
ers. If it is correct to find no fun in these bleak
entertainments, but to feel as above, then I am really
musical, and my Soul is O.IC.
“0.K." : What a shapely, sprightly “pan-
tomime boy” is Carrie Moore since her re-
generation ! She sings well, acts well, dances
gracefully, looks pretty, and lias any amount
of “way” with her. But because Carrie is
an Australian girl whose name and talent
have been familiar to us since she was a
mere kiddie, and also because she has been
knocking around in vaudeville here for the
past year or two, the J.C.W. firm never
thought, seemingly, of engaging her for the
next panto. The “boy” for the grand
annual custom will be imported. She is
usually an imported lady, and she never is
a patch upon the Carrie Moore who lately
appeared in “Babes in the Wood” at Mar-
low’s theatre at Melbourne. As far as I
can remember the Carrie Moore of other
days, who did play principal boy in at least
one J.C.W. panto, was a lean, unfurnished
stripling. She went to London and made a
hit in two or three of Courtneidge’s produc-
tions. Then the firm —seven years ago-
imported its long-lost Carrie to star as the
Merry Widow, a character for which she
hadn’t the right temperament. Now that
she is at her very best she figures in a
three-two-one show, and cuts no ice in the
newspapers that are always prepared to
grovel over a third-class performer from
Britain or America.
“Theorbo” : Laver’s orchestral programme
at Melbourne Auditorium last week in-
cluded the overture to Ambroise Thomas’s
"Mignon.” This was the work which was
performed in the Paris Opera Comique on
the night the house was burnt down with
loss of 150 lives. One scene is the burning
of a chateau. The mock fire turned into a
real one. The people could have got out,
but they thought the outbreak was in the
play until flames began to lick the prosce-
nium and roof. Then there was a rush.
The site remained vacant many days. It
was proposed to put up an expiatory church,
but funds failed to come in, and the Opera
Comique rose up instead, and “Mignon”
was performed again.
“Star” : An English illustrated weekly has
been discussing the creations of Pinero, ask-
ing which is the most vivid of bis characters,
and hitting upon Richard Phenyl in “Sweet
Lavender” as the party most alive. This
does not quite suit me. To my mind Pinero
created only one personality so actual that
I find myself continually coming up against
it in “real life.” This woman does not
appear in the plays at all. and owes her
undeniable existence to a phrase. She is
the first Mrs. Tanqueray, the creature “all
white marble and black velvet, who keeps a
thermometer in her stays that always
registers two degrees below zero.” The
second Mrs. Tank, is Pinero’s favorite, but
to me she is a passionate automaton while
her predecessor is a vital fact.


NEEDLESS FEAR OF
HEART TROUBLE
Many people have needless fears about the
state of their hearts. Sharp, shooting pains
that are sometimes present round the heart
worry the sufferer into dread of heart dis-
ease. As a matter of fact, pain in the heart
is scarcely ever present: in organic heart dis-
ease. The pain is nearly always from the
stomach.
When your digestion is out of order it often
affects the heart, and even causes an irregu-
larity in its beat. The gas produced by
undigested and fermented food may cause
pressure that affects the heart unpleasantly.
Hut these pains do not mean that you have
heart disease, nor need fear sudden death.
Tone up the stomach, correct any errors of
diet. Eat the right things, and net too much
of them. Don’t pamper your stomach with
pre digested food and artificial aids to diges-
tion. Tone up your stomach so that it will
do its own proper work. Don’t worry about
your heart; worry causes and aggravates in-
digestion.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Fills are the best diges-
tive tonic. First you notice an increase in
your appetite. Then you see that the food
does not distress you ; that you are no longer
troubled with wind, sour risings in the
throat, and those misleading pains round the
heart. Strength and energy return. A use-
ful booklet on “What to Eat and How to
Eat” will lie sent to anyone sending name
and address to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine

Pinkettes will be found an excellent laxa-
tive combination that should really help to
cure that dangerous condition known as
constipation. When they are taken accord-
ing to directions they are designed to correct
the irregularity so that the patient will not
have to take an opening medicine day after
day. They are a safe family medicine
because they contain no habit-creating drug;
they are daintily got up; easily given to
children, and they act thoroughly without
causing sickness and griping.*

USHER’S NEW METROPOLITAN HOTEL, Castlereagh Street, Sydnsy,
which was opened last Thursday, September 16.
Special Notice to Country
Visitors to Sydney.
The illustration on this page depicts the new Metropolitan Hotel, built under the
supervision of Host Usher, who for i->0 odd years has made a special feature of attend-
ing to the comfort and well-being of country people.
This new building—which is now open for guests—is fireproof from roof-tree to
foundation. It will not be possible to burn it down or to burn any pari; of it. The
staircases, internal Avails, floors and ceilings are wholly proof against tire. Every
bedroom, in fact every room in the house, is connected direct to the central offices of
the lire brigade, so that even the smallest conflagration will have no terror for the
occupant of any room. All that it will be necessary to do in case of lire is to walk
out of the room, close the door, and be in immediate safety.
Two main passenger elevators traverse the building through fireproof chambers.
Other elevators have been installed for moving goods, luggage, etc.
Throughout the whole building a unique system of Exhaust Tubing l a ; been
installed for the removal of dust and impure air. A great many of the bedroo; • are
proxuded with luxurious bathrooms; hot and cold water being available instantly.
Apart from the natural ventilation, the air will be silently removed from the
bedrooms, day and night, by means of an extensive method of power ventilation, and
not only is the air removed from the public rooms, but pure, dust free air. drawn from
a height of 150 ft. above the pavement is returned into the rooms continuously.
Host Usher has always been noted for the manner in xvheli he caters for the
comforts of the inner man, and the chef’s department in his new hotel is second to
nothing in any part of the world. It xvdl provide a cuisine on a par xvith the best
obtainable in London or America.
It is completely fitted with self-contained refrigerating plant, larders, storerooms,
bakery, etc.
On the ground floor are two entrances, one communicating to the main vestibule,
the second communicating direct to the Saloon and Lounge Bars.
Upon (he first and second floors are the I lining. Smoking, Lounge and Readiug
Rooms ; the third floor contains the Ladies’ Sitting Room.
The furniture consists of hand-made articles of chaste design, supplied by Beard,
Watson Ltd., and the quality and finish of their productions and fittings is fully
consistent with an hotel of the highest class.
Country and inter-State visitors to Sydney will find Host Usher ready to take
them on a visit of inspection over the new building, and will always he pleased to do
his utmost to make the Metropolitan a real home for those aa t lio decide to make his
hotel their toxvn residence.
In passing, it xvould bo as xvell to mention that the Pastoralist, Grazier and
Station Holder can still obtain from Host Usher his famous O.S.L. (“Old Special
Liqueur”) Whisky. This whisky is imported direct from the Distillers. It is
thoroughly matured, mellow, high-class whisky, guaranteed 12 years old before leaving
Scotland. It is trebly distilled, every care being made to preserve its unique quality
and flavor.
The shipments never vary in quality in the slightest way, so that when O.S.L. is
ordered a whisky of uniform character, purity and excellence is assured.
O.S.L. Whisky can be obtained either in bottle, 5-gallon demijohns, 5- to 10-gallon
kegs, octaves, and quarter casks at wholesale rates. ,
All country orders receive immediate attention. Letters and telegrams promptly
replied to.

DELICIOUS!
That is the comment made
after drinking
ALOR.
It tastes rich yet delicate ; is
refreshing, palatable, and is
delicious in every sense.
ALOK has a rich nut-fruity
taste; gives satisfaction, in-
spires and invigorates.
Try a Change: Drink ALOK.
It is not a medicine; it is a
beverage, with all the quali-
ties of a tonic.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long us possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

BEFORE THE MIRROR.
By “JEANNETTE.”
“Jeannette,” the well-known writer on Beauty Culture and author of “The Book of Beauty,”
1111l 111 he pleased to help and advise any reader on matters of the toilet. Queries should be accom-

■These are undoubtedly days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few —the more stoical among
us- can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are at present
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means. —
The secret of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature’s own method. The
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be removed, and an opportunity given to
the liner one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old. dead skin is allowed to remain
on the face that so many women, and even
young girls, suffer from pimples, blotches and
sallow dull skins, To remove, by absorption,
the dead outer skin and with it ail blemishes,
the use of mercolised wax is universally re-
commended. ordinary face creams being
powerless for this purpose. Smear the wax
over the face and neck, rub it gently into the
skin, and leave it on all night, in the morning
wash' •it off. using Pilenta soap and warm
water, when all the dead skin will be removed
with the wax. Then apply a lotion to prevent
any trace of greasiness being noticeable and
to give a peach-like bloom to the skin. A
lotion to do this can be made up quite cheaply
from the following recipe. Take one ounce of
cleminite and dissolve it in four tablespoonfuls
of hot water. Place in a bottle, and when cool
apply to the face with the finger tips, allowing
it to dry on the skin.
To Increase the Growth of the Hair. —Few
women give enough attention to the hair,
which, if it is to be kept in good condition,
requires systematic brushing, regular sham-
pooing, and a tonic for at least two or three
.months in each year. The hair should be
brushed every night for from five to ten
minutes, and the scalp massaged. When a
tonic is to be applied it should be dabbed into
the roots immediately after the massage, while
the scalp is still warm and glowing. To make
a simple and inexpensive lotion which will in-
crease the growth of the hair take a quarter
of a pint of bay rum, and add to it one ounce
of boranium. Shake well and allow it to stand
for half an hour, then strain, and add suffi-
cient water to make half a pint.
Superfluous Hair, and How to Remove It. —
Superfluous hair is a real trial to those who
daily see the growth which disfigures their
whole face steadily increasing, for nothing so
completely destroys a woman’s claim to good
looks. To remove it quickly and permanently
take a little pheminol and mix with a little
cold water. Dust the skin* from which the
liair is to he removed, with some powdered
alum, then apply the plieminol paste with a
hone knife'. Leave it on for two minutes, then
wash it off. If the growth he very strong two
or more applications may he necessary to re-
move it. hut this treatment will eventually so
weaken and destroy the roots that the trouble
will be banished for all time,
To Remove Blackheads. — ,Dissolve one effer-
vescing sty mol tablet in a glass Of hot Water,
allow the effervescence to subside, then difi it
small sponge into the liquid and mop over
the face. Allow it to remain on for a few
minutes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will he entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from reappearing use a stymol tab-
let in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—Before shampooing the
hair dip the fingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil. and thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can fall,
and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
To Wave the Hair.—To wave the hair do not
use waving irons, as these are most injurious
to the hair, causing it to fade and turn grey,
and to become harsh and brittle. Get two
ounces of silmerine at any chemist’s and damp
the hair with it, then either plait tightly,
tying the ends, or arrange it in waving pins.
The Trials of the Stout Woman.—The stout
woman is not only at a disadvantage in ap-
pearance, but she is always uncomfortable
physically and seldom in really good health
while she remains too fat. To remove obesity,
without injuring the general health or alter-
ing the usual diet, a few ciyhoi berries should
be eaten occasionally, and a glass of hot water
sipped after each meal. This combined treat-
ment will work Wonders in a very short tittle,
and is a most pleasant as well as effective
remedy.
Grey Hair. —To restore the Color of grey or
fading hair take one ounce of concentrated
tammalite and mix it with four ounces of bav
rum, apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will gradu-
ally resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush. [1

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
.Vo notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Rio: Yes, but Irving and his 6ft. 7in.,
which Thu Bulletin had already paragraphed, are
not at the Front, and apparently are not going there.
....Crank: Much obliged; but scarcely worth while
discussing plans for the Gallipoli campaign at this
misty distance. .. .A.S.: The sunken Majestic was not
an auxiliary cruiser. The vessel was a flagship, and
the pride of the navy in 1895; but she was only
71st on the list when the German submarine fin-
ished her. . . .South Sydney: Can’t work up much sym-
pathy for Tom Slattery. The fact is Tom “wants it
both ways.” To save his Government from a vote
of censure he thought it worth while to put up or
scrape up the £lOOO with Which George Gibbs
damned Chicago. Now, the vote of censure being
many years dead and buried, Tom wants the money
back. .. .S.V.W.: Confess with shame that we never
heard of the mine—if it is a mine. . . . C'laverton:
Sol Green never owned Solution. Oxenham owned
and bred Acrasia and Cerise and Blue. . . .Wanzeur:
This paper never said that war was not horrible, nor
did it ever try to controvert the argument that
militarism was abominable. Both are dreadful, and
Australia wants neither. ... Geebung: If you are
“entirely ignorant of the subject,*’ why write about
it? Chinky: Pray for victory over the Hun if
you like, but you must spray for victory over the
codlin moth. .. .Swim :It sank like a stone... .Rocks:
Dreary twaddle in pale ink on pink paper Selim:
Plans for putting a half-nelson on the Turk recefveol,,
with great thankfulness. . . .Wild: She loses a soldier!
Well, he can't help it, poor chap... . S.R.X.: The
N.orton Griffiths people are not contractors. They are
philanthropists. ~ .Note: Yes, but do you know
that in Dunedin they eat porridge for lunch?....
Sally: Full of nothing, including a vast emptiness
and an abyss.... Turquoise: Of course, you can sell
goodwill and get money for it. But it doesn’t follow
from this that it should be included as national
wealth. A pub has an excellent manager. He is
worth thousands to it. Should the pub-owner there-
fore put down among his wealth “possession of some;
thing special in managers”? Really, that’s what that
particular man’s goodwill is mainly composed of.
dhe manager puts on his hat and leaves, and the
goodwill leaves with him. It is rubbish for Ivnibbs
or anyone else to call that national wealth....
W.J.C.: Have you got a stamp about y0u?....
D.R.M.: “This is my fourth attempt to make some-
thing tliat is up to your standard.” Sorry you’ve got
no luck in even numbers.... Bill B.: Prose too
heavy, and the Indian lyric on an old theme is ram-
shackle verse. The unfamiliar strain of rhyming
warps your English M.C. (V.): Very crude verse.
.... Watchman: True or not, the story has no humor.
It is merely horrible E.M.E.: Right into the bulls-
eye of the basket!.... Momona: Poem talks through
its nose and leaves us in doubt.... E.C.J, • Do birds
sing when they’re sad, or do they just shut up?
....Protein: The rhyme needs blowing up and re-
building 1 , and we doubt, whether you can do it or
whether it is worth while J.S.B« The battle poet
with flame issuing from his nostrils is a terrifying
sight. It is a wonder you didn’t scorch your manu-
script. .. .C.J.T.: We hope the Devil doesn’t talk like
that Doc: One gag we have heard before, and the
other we expect to hear at any minute. The serious :
verse goes booming down to death.... Soda W.: Are
you a large, fat man with red side-whiskers and a
taste for horse-racing? If not, you ought to be...."
G.R.H.: Sorry unsuitable Yung: Hardly enough
body and soul in it. And you forgot to attach your
name and address Emily G. H.: It is such an
innocent, blue-eyed poem that we hesitate to send it
home by post. It should be sent home by tram in
chaige of a serious elderly person with unimpeach-
able references Quiz: Like most first attempts it
fails to stop the traffic. .. .Nevvy: Oh, yes, there is
always hope. But you must supply it. We remain
in charge of the acid.. 1 . S.D.E.: Spring has arrived,
and this staff has to tie itself in its various chairs in
order to keep on reading poems about wattle and
blue seas and clouds instead of going Out to look at
these things in person. So please don’t babble more
than you can help. . . .F.S.T.Y.: You arc earning-
encouragement in small doses.... Trench: Do you
remember the verses:—
Ho! the Ballad-writer rose,
Snorting slaughter down his nose,
And he drew his pen as though it were a sword?
That s what you remind us of when you whet your
beak on the corrugated-iron roof of Australian litera-
ture Mena: Not much interested in the dreadful
state of things in Egypt five months ago. No doubt
the Red Cross people were taken unawares. But, if
it comes to that, so was everybody else—except,
apparently, the Turk. He was the only one who
had much beforehand information about what was
going to happen; and even he didn’t know every-
thing.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.S.P.: The joke on the brown-paper bag has been
thrown at the enemy. That shows how mad we are
with the enemy W.J.: Two perfectly flat people
making a doubtful joke....M. Anderson: Some
humor, but the anatomy is out. . . .Torrie: Your lady
angels are too chesty F.M.L.: Thanks; handed
on Frong: Very little use for photos. But they
ought to interest one of the weeklies that illustrate
that way.
In order that they may have the privilege
of pulling cows’ teats, Maorilanders have
lately paid the staggering price of £135 an
acre for dairying land near Gisborne. Now
what does the Cold Hash Government think
is going to be the end of this sort of thing?
George Meudell has flung at Victoria a
statistical brick which ought to make that
State blink its sleepy eyes, even if it doesn’t
wake right up. In five years, he shows, the
number of Victorian public servants, outside
the Railways, has increased 45 per cent.,
while salaries have increased 50 per cent.
But that wouldn’t matter if these public
servants were earning their keep. That
neither they nor the money which has been
borrowed. has done anything of the sort is
shown by the further fact that Australian
taxation (State and Commonwealth) went
from £11,580,964 in 1901-2 to £22.892,742 in
1913-14. In other words, while the ..popula-
tion of Australia has increased only 27 per
cent., the excess of expenditure over earn-
ings. which has had to be made good by
taxation, has increased just on 100 per cent.

IN BANANA LAND
Bananaland’s just-dead Clerk of Parlia-
ments, C. W. Costin, won his way to the
Brisbane Grammar School on a State
scholarship ; and so did his schoolmate and
chum, T. J. Byimes, the brilliant, lazy man
who was afterwards Premier of Queensland.
A courteous, able official, who looked after
budding Parliamentarians like a father,
Costin helped many a now well-known poli-
tician on the way to eminence.
The sudden death at sea on September 16
of Capt. Chas. Reis, R.N.R., aboard the
Uupara, recalls the fact that in 1878 when
Russia was a bogey which threw Australia
into convulsions Reis was put in charge of
a little gunboat called the Pippo to patrol
the coast of Moreton Bay and so frighten
off the enemy. The deceased mariner was
30 years in the employ of the Adelaide S.S.'
Co., and latterly was pilot for its fleet
through the Ilinchinbrook Channel on the
Queensland coast. Somebody must have
killed a Chinaman on the Ruparj> She
caught fire just before Reis died, and the
vessel reached Port Jackson with a dead
pilot and a live conflagration on board.
It lives still, up at Rockhampton—the
“Australian Freedom League,” for the aboli-
tion of Compulsory Training. It throws
literature over the back fence for the citizen
to read, and- then hurriedly runs away to
the sandheap and sticks its head in. A
sample from the latest pamphlet:—
The time lias arrived when the civil population of
an invaded country has little to fear from a properly
organised and disciplined army if it does not resist
and uses reasonable care to keep out of the way of
bursting shells.
Of course everyone knows that, especially
the people who got out of Louvain, and those
others who dodged Jack Johnsons while they
were munching turnips outside Brussels.
Likewise the people of Galicia and Poland,
who are wandering' about looking for crusts
and a dug-out. This illuminative pamphlet
carries the information that it is issued by
Edward Foreman, and it appears to be the
fifteenth of a series. Foreman is a grocer
at Rockhampton, and The Bulletin is sure
that his scales are better balanced than one,
other important part of the outfit.
“Norbell” : If this isn’t a world’s record
for shearing it ought to be. At Wanta-
laynia, out Winton. way, over 10,000 jum-
bucks have just been operated on, and five
•shearers (sit tight!) in one day averaged
260 sheep per man,
“5.8.”: Drought-stricken Longreach has
sent 355 men to the Front, besides others
who enlisted in Brisbane. And those who
couldn’t go and argue the point with Abdul
Bill dropped £3OOO into the liat on the
latest Patriotic “Day.” Considering how
small and sun-dried Longreach is, this is
a better record even than Gliarleville’s; and
we are not saying that Charleville’s isn’t
good.
“Milo” : While oysters- are found along the
coast of North Queensland in considerable
quantities, of good flavor, and much larger
than those dredged from the south coast of
N. S. Wales, growers declare that they can-
not cultivate them in beds. The other day
I talked to an oyster man about his failure
to grow crops of the fish, and tried
to= persuade him that he was neglect-
ing a great primary industry and
turning his hack on one of the coun-
try’s chief natural resources. He, in
THE COMPLIMENT.
“Oh, my Lord Bishop, to decide an argument, toe agreed to leave it to your decision-of
all the improper books ever written, which do you consider 'the worst?"
turn, blamed the big black and white crab
of the North, and made affidavit that he
had lost capital in every effort to raise a
crop in beds. When the oysters are within
easy reach of the crab they are unable to
feed, because the watchfulness of the leggy
crustacean enables him to detect the first
sign of opening, and he”promptly places a
small pebble in the doorway, thereby pre-
venting the house being shut up again. Then
the crab banquets at will on the helpless
oyster, and the bivalve birthrate is, none the
better for it.
“Townsville’”; While the politicians are
saying that it is the duty of every fit and
free man to enlist, other people are stamp-
ing out enthusiasm with both feet. Many
men of the North have enlisted, and after
passing the local medical /test have been
feted and cheered and gone away to Bris-
bane only to be turned down. Then they
have crept home again to try to get back what
they sold, and to find their friends’ welcome
as cheerful to them as flat beer. This sort
of thing is no good. Either there is no
standard -of medical fitness, or, if there is,
the. pied ical men don’t know how to apply it,
with the result that some splendid, willing
fellows are made fools of and humiliated.
“Dick” Sumner, Queensland’s Board for
the Control of Prices, finds his job no Dorcas
meeting. He lowered the price of milk
lately from 7d. a quart to sid., and was in-
terviewed by a crowd of injured milk-mer-
chants who successfully demonstrated that,
with the present price of fodder, pure juice
at sld. wasn’t a business proposition. Sum-
ner now proposes to tackle the fodder ques-
tion as the basis of the milk problem, and is
likely to do no better with it than Davy Hall
did in N. S. Wales. So far, something has
gone wrong with every Queensland attempt
at official market-rigging.
All experts know how fruitful a cause of
swine disease skim-milk can be; hence, to
please the pigs, the Ryan Government re-
cently issued a regulation which requires
“milk fed to calves or pigs at any dairy ol-
factory to be heated to 180 degrees Fahr. for
10 minutes.” Then, to please the hogs, who
might be a little inconvenienced if they had
to light a fire and keep it going for 10
minutes, it was next announced that “there
is reason to believe the new regulation will
not be enforced.” The liog-pen is mightier
than the sword. In fact, according to this
latest report, Ryan is so ashamed of his
sword that he proceeds to swallow it.
Last year Liberalism in the Queensland
Assembly was “putting on the gag,” and
Labor Avas strenuously objecting to the
“murder of free speech.” To-day Labor is
doing the gagging and Liberalism is raising
the howl about the murder. A beautiful
thing this Party Government!.
t “Viking”: The moss-covered complaint of
N. S. Wales stock owners might disappear
if Ma took lessons from her Northern daugh-
ter. In Queensland, when drought forced
the graziers to seek green fields for their
starving stock, instructions were issued that
the supply of sheep-vans should be aug-
mented by the conversion of cattle trucks.
Within 10 days five-score stock waggons
had been converted into double-deckers. These
were commissioned as they were ready, and
large numbers of sheep were soon being
dragged from the dry west to the green coast.
The work is still going on, for the drought is
not yet “broken,” though some of the smaller
pastoralists are.
“Milo” on a perpetual grievance:—
The Cane Price Boards promised by the Queensland
Government as a protection to growers will be only
another abortive effort to overcome an evil which
curses the sugar industry because it does not touch
the root. All the evils are traceable to the existence
of only one buyer and one seller of Australian sugar.
The sugar content is a controlling - factor in assessing
the value of cane. It ranges from 5 per cent, to 15
per cent, of available sugar, according to the district
and the variety of cane grown. Thousands of tons
running from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, “density” are
milled at Central (co-operative) Mills. But the
C.S.R. Co. will not mill any of a less density than
8 p.0.c.5., because low-grade cane costs as much to
crush as the better sort. If the Boards fix a price
for 6 per cent, cane, then the C.S.R. Co. can refuse
to crush it. While the bonus was in existence the
co. crushed everything sent along, but when the
bonus was abolished that policy was altered. The
Board may fix the price, but what is the use of that
if the grower cannot get the co. to take the stuff?
The C.S.R. Co. has spared neither trouble nor ex-
pense in improving the most profitable sorts for
farmers to grow, but the cussedness of the sugar
farmer is as persistent as the cussedness of the cow
cocky who knows that he has. a beast testing less than
3 pei - cent, of butter fat, and yet keeps the wastrel
in his herd. Should it be made compulsory for the
co. to crush unprofitable cane, then the grower of
high-density cane can bet his socks that it is he who
in the end will carry the indifferent grower. If the
Boards are given power to fix the price, what
is wrong with giving them power to fix the mini-
mum percentage of sugar which the miller shall be
required to crush?

QUEENSLAND.
P. F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 18. 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
His Ex. is at present sampling the good
salt breeze at Southport, whither he went
yesterday to open a Show. Lady Goold-
Adams put in her Saturday uncorking two
fetes. One happened at Rosalie, ana was in
aid of the wounded soldiers’ fund ; the other
was at Wooloowin State School, and was to
help the seminary cultivate some of its side-
lines.
Dr. Sharpe, Bishop of New Guinea, who
was thrown off his horse last Monday while
riding round One Tree Hill, has put' in the
past week at St. Helen’s Hospital. He is
patching up nicely.
C. W. Costin, Clerk of Parliaments,
crossed over on Monday. After leaving the
Grammar School, where he shone, young
Costin first joined the Courier and after-
wards the Telegraph. Then lie went to
the Toowoomba Chronicle ; from there to
Hansard. Mrs. Costin was a Miss Sutton.
Both the dead man’s parents are still alive.
Costin, sen., was a chemist in the early
days. In the son the Rifle Club movement,
the A.N.A., the Royal Society, and the
Grammar School Old Boys’ Association
have lost a helper, and the City Rifle Club
has lost its captain. Lieutenant “Joe” Cos-
tin, who stuck to his machine-gun on April
25 at the Dardanelles until he was killed,
was the deceased good citizen’s only boy.
The Minister for Public Instruction gave
a river trip on Friday afternoon in honor
of Vic. Director-of-Education Tate. Since
he arrived Mr. Tate has put in a good deal
of his time visiting schools. If he wasn’t
pleased with what he saw he made a good
jolt of hiding his annoyance.
The movement to appoint Jane Hops has
been wrapped in a cold blanket of disap-
proval by the Inspector-General of Police
and others in authority. A compromise is
suggested whereby the appointment of an
additional inspectress for keeping an eye
or two on State children and factories where
women and girls are employed may be made.
Anyhow,-the spectacle of one of the, gentler
sex, Thargomindah, putting the hammer-
lock on to the homing midnight reveller of
Brisbane is unlikely. These are unpic-
turesque times.
Brisbane lias taken a line from Sydney,
and is starting various regimental comforts
funds. Mrs. Spencer Browne has another
scheme in hand for providing Christmas
etceteras for all Queensland troops.
The fourth batch of Queensland wounded
arrived on Wednesday night. His Ex. and
Lady Goold-Adams were present to meet the
men, and the former made an unnecessary
speech, and J. M. Hunter, M.L.A., supplied
another. Aid. Jenkinson, more humane,
contented himself and the crowd by merely
remarking “Good luck and welcome home,”
or words- to that effect.
There is a wounded Queenslander who
badly-wants to know how a youngster with
a N. S. Wales landing party at Gallipoli got
on The Queenslander does not know the
name of his brother Australian. All he
knows is that when he was making his way
back to the beach with a shattered arm, a
warrior with the N.S'.W. badge on his sleeve
and an ugly hole in his leg bandaged the
wounded wing and passed on with a cheer-
ful “So-long!” I wish he would, tell me
who and where he is, for I want to gladden
the heart of a sick Bananalander.
Jack Coakes, ' son of the managing-
director of Finney, Isles, has gone into camp
with the Motor Transport. He is very
young, but his anxiety to get away to the
war and his frieiidly relations with motor
power cleared the way for him.
Corporal Merchant is merely winding
himself up to have another whiz at the
enemy, for already he has had varied and
hard-boiled experiences with the Navy. He
served with the Flying Squadron and the
Channel Fleet, and was instructor on the
Australian Station in gunnery and torpedoes.
He took part in an expedition to Morocco,
and has seen service in the South Seas, and
at Burmah. By way of upholding the
navy’s reputation for usefulness he has now
joined the 6th Field Engineers.
A marriage of interest to Westerners will
happen at the end of this month, when
Peter Ferrier, of Surat, one of a family
noted for its outsize in height and hospi-
tality, will place a wedding-ring on the
finger of Essie Smith, of Portland, Roma.
Marjorie Cuppaidge, youngest chick of
Dr. and Mrs. Cuppaidge, Gympie, has
accepted the half-hoop of imnending matri-
mony from Jack Meehan, eldest son of the
J. K. Meehans, now of Sydney, once of
Townsville.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
When John Moffat and A. T. Linedale,
of the Irvinebank Mining 00., called on
Treasurer Theodore the other day to tell
him what a good time it would be for the
Government to build a sugar-mill at
Bailey’s Creek (a few miles above Cairns)
—they are versatile fellows these Irvinebank
mining-men, and don’t keep all their eggs in
one basket —they were not exactly among
strangers. They were introduced by Harry
Ryan, who previous to last elections was
union secretary at Wolfram, where his
union had a bitter struggle with “old
John,” which ended in some kind' of
a draw after the mines had been hung up
for a year or so. About the same time or a
little earlier Theodore was earning a crust
around the mines at Irvinebank and Stan-
nary Hills, where he and McCormack (now
Speaker) brought forth the fighting A.W.A.
and were promptly n .ked—and not for
the State Trea'surership and Speaker'swdiair
either.

TROUBLED
NERVES
SET RIGHT
What’s the great and growing disease? It is
NERVOUSNESS. And it is far more serious
than most people realise. Yon see it every-
where. And you see it in many stages. Its
early symptoms are so common, and seem so
harmless, that even the sufferers regard them
with indifference. But —
Nervousness is progressive. It gets steadily
worse as the nervous system runs down, and
people become so depressed, and get the “blues”
so much, that they often feel that life is hardly
worth living. And —
How is it with YOU? Does your work
exhaust you? Are you nervy and apt to start at
unexpected sounds? Do you feel shaky and
low-spirited? Have you no vitality? Do you
suffer from sleeplessness? Are you subject to
headaches or neuralgia? These and many other
symptoms are positive indications of nerve weak-
ness, proclaiming the need of a scientific nerve
regenerator, such as NER-YIM WAFERS.
They conquer nervousness, feed and tone up the
nerves, restore vitality, rebuild the wasted tis-
sues, and banish weariness and depression. At
the same time the appetite and stomach improve
and many digestive troubles disappear; the
heart, kidneys and other organs do their work
properly, and the brain becomes clearer and
stronger. Ner-Vim Wafers are remarkably
effective, and remarkably successful. They are
equally good for men. women and children.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I HE ordinary crowd which gathers in
front of the Central Court littered the
steps as I mounted them. There were
the excited groups of people who make the
occasion of even a remote connection with “a
case in court” a memorable day’s excite-
ment. There were the seedy men with
anxious, strained faces, half ashamed of
being seen, and fearfully anxious about the
ordeals they had to face—most of them there
about summonses, which, had they known
it, need not have troubled them. There were
people who fidgeted uneasily; others who
stoically waited, used to the surroundings,
for judgment on possibly serious matters; all
sorts and conditions of men. I*olice-court
solicitors and solicitors’ clerks, on the look-
out for old clients for the purpose of intro-
ductions to other clients, dodged in and out.
I was a little ahead of the time when
there would be a sudden shuffling towards
the various courts on the stroke of 10 o’clock
and self-important officers of the law would
call “Silence!” in the court-rooms.
At the top of the steps I met Lane.
“I say, old chap,” he said, hurriedly,
“could you oblige me with a couple of quid
till later? I came down with just a little
silver because of a ’phone message from a
country friend, and I find that what lie
wants is this cash, and I can’t get it unless
I go back to Balmain. A friend and fellow-
townsman of his wants it to help a friend's
son through some trouble ; and he wants it
quick and lively.”
“I’m sorry, 1 haven’t got two quid,” I
said. “I would gladly”
"iou see, the money’s wanted to pay
some solicitor’s costs, and if it’s not forth-
coming he won’t act. It means business to
me if I can fix up my friend : I'll get his
friend’s business, anyway, and some others.
1 don’t know a soul here. You know some
of these lawyer-johnnies, don’t you?”
I admitted I did; and then, seeing Dan
Itiley, the solicitor, told Lane to hang on
for a minute. I wanted to oblige Lane just
as badly as he wanted to oblige liis friends.
“I’d let you have the couple in a second,
if I had it,” said Riley, heartily, when I
asked him. “Wait a bit, tuough ; I’ll have
some money in a minute or two, and then
you can have it. Look out for me.”
“How long?” I asked.
“Oh, only a few minutes —not more than
five, certainly,” said Riley, as he bustled
away.
I went back and told Lane that he could
have the cash within five minutes ; and Lane
took me over and introduced me to two
obviously “financial” countrymen, Green
and Falconer.
“It’s lucky we met you, then,” said Green.
“I didn’t like to mention the particulars on
the ’phone to Lane, making sure that he’d
have a couple of notes about him. I had
no need to bring any coin with me when I
came in this morning; so when I met Fal-
coner here I couldn’t fix him up.”
“They cleared me out at the races yester-
day,” said young Falconer. “I’ve wired
home for some dough, but I can’t expect it
for an hour or two. Ttie chap who wants
the money is a fellow I’d like to oblige, if I
can—it’s a son of a great triend of his
who’s in the mess. If the lawyer doesn’t
get his four guineas he won’t appear.”
“Oh, it’s jour guineas!” I cried in dis-
may.
"Oh, two quid has been fixed up already,”
he answered. He looked, at Green. “We’d
better tell them it’s arranged,” he added.
Lane and I remained talking together for
a while, until Green and Falconer returned
with another man. They signalled Lane.
Presently he came back to me, perturbed.
“See if you can get the cash straight
away,” he said. “The sharks are waiting
for it.”
- lii turn I pursued the benevolent Itiley,
catching him just as he was entering the
door of No. 1 Court.
“Can’t do it just now,” he said. “But I will
in a jiffy. Wait somewhere about here for me.”
I hurried away with my news to Lane,
and then returned. The jiffy was a fairly
long one; but finally Itiley appeared, quite
suddenly, in a desperate hurry.
“I’ve got a cheque here for a couple of
quid you can have. It’s not my own, but
it’s good enough,” lie explained swiftly.
I duly handed the slip of paper to Lane,
and then drifted away to attend to my own
affairs, which kept 'me till lunch-time. I
met Itiley as I passed out.
“Come and ■Jiave a taste,” he said; and
while we took our ease in the lounge-bar he
passed a scrap of paper over to me. “Seen
that before?” he asked.
“Why. it’s the cheque you handed me this
morning,” I exclaimed. “How the”
“Exactly,” returned Itiley, laughing. “That
little piece of paper for a couple of quid has
paid me four quids’ worth of costs this
morning.”
“Then you were the skinflint solicitor who
wouldn’t appertftill he had received his four
guineas costs'?” ~
same who accepted a
cheque for t \\V quid -to go on with, then
passed on the cheque to a friend, and duly
received the same two quid back as payment
foi the balance. The nett result, by the way,
seems to be that you owe me two pounds:”
“And somebody else, who is owed the-
money by somebody else, who also has some-
one else to collect from, owes me two
pounds,” I added.
But the nett result was worse than that.
Riley still waits, good-naturedly, for his
money. Lane hasn’t paid me yet—he says
he hasn’t been reimbursed himself. And the
father of the young man about whom all
the trouble was taken, was mad that anyone
should have taken any trouble at all, and
won’t part a cent.
As for the two-pound cheqlie itself, that-
very interesting document proved to be worth
nothing at all when presented at the bank.
The cheque being worthless, Riley did not
lend me anything, nor did I let Lane have
anything. Riley was innocently guilty of
passing valueless paper, and I repeated his
offence.
Riley admits that the case is a peculiar
one. He suggests “a quid” as a compromise.

Are you Worried about Baby ?
HOW to feed Baby is often a great worry to
mothers who are unable to nurse their
babies themselves. Ordinary cow’s milk—
however prepared at home—is not a suitable
substitute for the mother’s milk. It is acid in
reaction, contains harmful germs and forms
dense curds in the stomach that cannot be
digested. Decide to use the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
which are the only series of Foods scientifically
adapted to the growing requirements of the
child. You will be delighted when you see
how well your baby thrives on this Method of
Infant Feeding. The ‘Allenburys’ Foods are free
from all dangerous organisms; they are portable,
being in powder form and packed in sealed tins.

Sirs,
“1 see by your circulars you have pamphlets on infants feeding and
management. Kindly send me one, it may prove very helpful now or
in the future. I have a beautiful boy fed on your foods since infancy,
we tried other foods (not knowing of yours) and they almost killed
him, he became so thin and old looking that I felt compelled to have
the doctor’s advice. Directly he saw the child he said he was being
starved, he was nothing but bone ; he told me to try Allen & Hanbury's
foods and see how they would act. I did so with a marvellous result,
in a week there was a big change, he is now eleven months old and
such a big boy—not flabby fat but proportionate. He is just starting
to walk and has eight teeth so you see his illness has not made him
backward. I feel I cannot say enough for your foods and advertise
them all I can. Trusting you will send the pamphlet I asked for,”
Yours ever grateful,
Mrs. H. Pearson.
A Doctor In New Zealand writes:
Gentlemen,
“It may interest youto know that your Infants Foods are largely
prescribed by us out here and are found to fulfil all they promise
to do. I find the No. r Food most invaluable. The young mother of

The said Mary Theresa Farrell was the
last-surviving child of Patrick Farrell and
Margaret Mary Farrell (formerly McAul-
iffe). Patrick Farrell died in New South
Wales on the 22nd October, 1870. It is
believed that he was born at Portumna,
County Galway, Ireland, in or about 1816,
and that he emigrated to New South Wales
about 1841. Margaret Mary Farrell died
in New South Wales on the 24th August,
1893. The Defendant Ellen Jowsey claim-
ing to be a first cousin on the maternal side
of the said Mary Theresa Farrell claims to
be entitled to the whole estate as the sole
next of kin of the said intestate. The
father of Ellen Jowsey, James Enright
(also called JAMES TROY), is believed to
have gone to the United States about 1857 ;
her mother, Mary Enright (formerly
McAuliffe), is believed to have died in
Limerick in 1857. The said Ellen Jowsey is
believed to have had (among others) three
brothers, of whom the names and material
particulars are believed to be as follows:
JAMES ENRIGHT (also called JAMES
TROY) at one time in the S9th Regiment

rile Bunbury Forrest has written to the
lerth papers expressing grief at the dis-
appearance of black swans from the Swan
Kiver. Years ago, when Bigjohn ruled the
roost in the West, he made the river, from
h remantle to Perth and beyond, a sanctuary
tor native game, and stocked it with several
hundred pinioned swans. Provision was
made for feeding them, and in a little while
the number increased to thousands. Then
feeding was discontinued, and the flock has
gradually diminished until now only a few
are left. Those that didn’t die of starvation
were devoured by dingoes which haunt the
upper reaches of the river. If Seaddan
doesn t mind we’ll call it Wild Dog Creek
for the future. _ It seems more appropriate,
from the financial point of view, anyhow.
“Dinkum Oil”: After all, the talk about
the preponderance of Germany’s ammuni-
tion supplies over those of the Allies seems
to have been overdone. The latest cable
news indicates that Hans the gunnel
couldn’t hit a flock of haystacks sitting on a
fence. During liis recent visit to French’s
headquarters, George Beid, Australia’s
Broad Commissioner, was twice under
shrapnel fire, and not a shot struck him.
Ir the Hun cannot scupper a target like
that his marksmanship is hopeless.
The Commonwealth is shortly to have a
visit from Louis de Rougemont, whose tall
Nor’-West Australian yarns mesmerised the
Wide World magazine a few years ago.
With him comes a new Mrs. Louis, who
describes her husband—the third she has
tried —as a “delightful child of nature,” who
“will yet startle the world with the revela-
tion of a great truth.” Whether the great
truth will out during his impending visit
she does not say.
A Bill to strangle the “red plague” is now
before the Westralian Parliament. Any
person, male or female, suffering from
syphilis must within three days consult a
doctor, who must report to the Health Com-
missioner. Penalty: £2O. Chemists are
prohibited from treating cases, but will be
allowed to sell certain proprietary medicines
approved by the authorities. The disease is
to be treated by doctors only, and quack
advts. are to be stopped. Afflicted women
are to be detained till cured, free of charge 7
and, apparently, afflicted men are to be per-
mitted to roam around and maintain the
supply.
“0.K.”: What do thoughtful people think
of Chief Justice John Madden, of Victoria,
and what does that notable citizen think
about himself? On his -etara to Melbourne
from England three or four months ago he dis-
couraged recruiting by giving a lecturette on
the war to the effect that Germany would
be satisfactorily beaten before the end of
August. Obviously there was no need for
preparing further Australian forces for the
Front if the allegations, suggestions and
theories of the professedly well-informed
Madden were correct. Then came the
“naturalised”-German attempt to get the in-
ternment of Wallach, of the Australian (Ger-
man) Metal Co., declared illegal. John
Madden, asf Chief Justice, led' the Court in
pronouncing the internment illegal, and Wal-
lach was released. Now the High Court bas
unanimously squelched the Chief
The two most serious errors, both of them
calculated to have very evil effects, suggest
such a grave lack of judgment in this vital
matter that Mr. Madden might almost be
expected to notice it and silence himself
accordingly.
“Party-Hack” writes :—-
The time is budding for a clear exposition or some-
thing with regard to the position Allen Taylor occu-
pies in the N. S. Wales body politic. The other
evening a proposed railway made a sudden appearance
in the Assembly. It was to run from Regent’s Park to
Cabramatta, in the suburban area. Even the Minister
who introduced the Bill was mystifild. It was always
understood that the Bankstown linfVwas to be con-
tinued to cut the Southern line at Liverpool, and
that has always been referred to as a sensible plan ;
but the proposed line to Cabramatta would render
this other proposal unnecessary. The Railway Com-
missioners reported that the new line would be run
at an annual loss of £7510. Some people would
say that this isn’t the time to want to lose £7510 a
year. But that apparently was neither here nor there.
And, anyhow, it wasn’t the point that had attention:
Opposition-leader Wade openly said: “Here we have
Allen Taylor s brickyard again,” and hinted at worse
things. Another member remarked that it was'funny
that the “same old crowd were always getting in,”
and added that he had been told that the
“Quid pro Quo Syndicate” had fixed up the
line. As far as this writer knows there
is nothing to -connect Allen Taylor with the “Quid
pro Quo Syndicate,” and he is not prepared to en-
dorse Gregory Wade’s reference to the “Allen Taylor
brickyard.” But the fact remains that a section
of N.S.W. politicians is continually making dark
allusions to the fact that certain Ministers are
under Allen Taylor’s thumb, and it is idle to deny
that a certain proportion of citizens give heed.
Therefore the time srems quite ripe for a thunder-
storm to clear the political atmosphere. ‘Has any-
body got a thunderstorm ?

keep up the pace.
Big Ben is a big watch-
like alarm clock, with an
eye for accuracy and an

He serves as the morn-

as he’s told, and when
he’s told.
He stands seven inches tall,
well-poised, massive, and richly

every other year, there is no
telling how long he will last.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,

you cannot find him in your town,

THE ideal shoe is the shoe that feels unmistakably
one’s own, as if made for oneself and no other.
Something about it, .some individuality of style,
some perfection of fit gives it this personal quality,
which is the secret of distinction in dress.
Herein lie the charm and excellence of Bostock
shoes. Their range is delightfully varied, each style
with its own particular piquancy and
originality, and all possessing those re-
markable fitting properties so character-
istic of Bostock.
Ladies who wish to make a trial of

“II.S.”: The dailies reap profit from
advts. on all sorts of personal topics—births,
deaths and marriages; silver and golden
weddings; rolls of honor and in-memoriam
notices; intimations that Mr. Smith will no
longer he responsible for the debts con-
tracted by his wife, and solemn warnings
that if Mrs. Blank doesn’t cease slandering
Mrs. Dash’s name she will be required to
prove her mendacious words without respect
of persons. All these and many other side-
lights are cast on the social life of the com-

paper is a novelty: —
ENGAGEMENT.
To Mr. J. GEORGE—
I hasten to offer you my most sincere congratula-
tions and hearty good wishes, on your Engagement
to Miss Alice Williams. May Heaven bless both of
you.—Your Sincere Friend,
J. MALOVICH.
It opens up so many possibilities. For
example:—•
DEBT PAID.
To Mr. Oofless, —I hear you have paid Henry
Mutton, the butcher, the bill which you have owed
him for so many months. Splendid. God bless you.
-—Your faithful pal, H. STONE-BROKE.
Or again:—
SACKED.
And so, my dear Arthur Alcohol, you have got the
bullet from your job in the Manchester Department,
and are now despairingly considering the question of
enlisting for King and oountry. Accept my sym-
pathy. Gott strafe the employing classes. —Yours
ever, JAMES BEER.
Now what enterprising newspaper pro-
spector will develop this new field?

“8.X.” : When I first saw G. B. Simpson
as a Supreme Court Judge I had just joined
the law-reporting staff of a Sydney morning
daily; and as the old man expressed some
interesting views from the Bench that day
I promptly published them in a paragraph.
Next morning I was warned off the course
by one of the veteran hands, who told me
I’d be very lucky if Simpson didn’t contra-
dict the paragraph from the Bench when
the Court met, and invite me to see him in
his room.- He didn’t, as a matter of fact—
perhaps he had been really misreported this
time! —but, anyway, the warning almost
cured me of any desire to turn pleasant copy
out of this particular Judge. I was cured
definitely a few weeks later, when he
screamed out that he had been misrepre-
sented by one of the most accurate men on
the Sydney press over some tiff with Judge
Gibson, and sent orderlies and various other
persons scurrying all over the city to find
the writer and drag him into his presence.
Next to his persistence in turning down
something he didn’t like the look of in cold
print, the most potent qualities possessed
by Simpson were an excellent knowledge of
law and an astonishing capacity for worry-
ing himself and everybody else in Court
because an affidavit hadn’t been correctly
filed, or wasn’t properly gummed, or some
other non-essential.

On no authority whatever The Bulletin
learns that the promotion of the Grand
Duke Nicholas to be Viceroy of the Caucasus
was due to the Czar’s desire that his dis-
tinguished relative should have time to com-
plete his forthcoming work on “How I Lured
Them On.” the main features of which have
been so often appreciatively alluded to by
Australian daily-paper writers on Russian
strategy.
MY DOG PROCLAMATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why not increase the dog tax? Make it £1 per
head, with the present 2s. 6d. per head rate on
sheep-dogs and those used in gaining a living in
the country. Thus we could raise revenue and
get rid of useless mongrels at the same time.
-—Cowardly suggestion in Sydney paper.
Let us all stand at a high window and contemplate
the universe of dogs!
Old dogs, young dogs, gay dogs and sad dogs —
Well-bred dogs and dogs that were more or les3
accidental;
Dogs that were not required, but which, having
occurred,
Have to continue somehow to be dogs;
Dogs without homes or owners or religion or poli-
tics ;
Dogs with problematical futures, intense presents,
And pasts which they would rather not talk about;
All trotting and sniffing and hurrying hither and
thither,
Without any prearranged plan or plot whatsoever,
Getting out of the way of trams —getting into the
way of people;
Drifting affably sideways with tongue lolling
thirstily ;
Proceeding economically with a minimum of wear
and tear on three legs;
Or bolting expensively on all four with tail tucked
well into safety,
Hatches battened down, all fleas stowed and ears
laid flat back.
Consider, I say, this shifting haze or phantasmagoria
of dogs !
What lazy department of Providence orders their
lives
And leaves them to root for their bones amid hatred
and greed ?
I dislike every dog that has fleas —and no dog is
without.
Yet I find all these dogs of great use in my trade
or profession.
1 write of the inward-bound dogs and the outward-
bound dogs ;
And the crosswise dogs are also of enormous im-
portance.
I stand at this high window where I cannot possibly
smell them
And write of their comings and goings, their loves
and intrigues,
Of their manners and customs, their politics, wars
and expressions,
And the profit is simply immense while the fun is
worth having.
So I say let the dog 3 still remain, for my floor is
the seventh ;
I can’t smell or fall over the brutes, and my dustbin
eludes them.
Let us play no mean dog’s-tricks on dog 3! Seek the
revenue elsewhere!
That’s enough for the present!
Let me hear no more of it!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It cleajs the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The Black Camel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WOKE as I watched by him; I had
fallen into sleep—-
Between the midnight and the morn
how slow the hours creep !
And where the slats were open wide above
his tossing head
1 saw the street as bright as day across his
tumbled bed ;
lie slept and struggled in his sleep beneath
the drowning drug,
It caught him by the pulsing throat and
gripped him like a thug
dust for a little. Ere the dawn the evil
drowse would pass
And Bain wou.d come and twist his face
like Deatli seen through a glass.
The moon was on the hills to-night, and in
the pinewo.id's gloom
Between each bough her lingers shone like
candles in a room ;
The street was white as seashore sand, and
down (lie bridle track
I saw a ghostly presence come; a humped
and jetty back,
A strangely swaying lizard head and muffled
feet it had.
It turned the little mountain trail into a
camel pad,
And I was glad he should be free the dreary
day before.
I prayed the strange black camel come and
kneel outside our door.
The houses were all darkened now along
the blinded street;
No one but I to see it kneel and hear its
stealthy feet.
Bod knows it was because I loved that I
would have it free
The frenzied brain, the fell disease stealing
my man from me.
He would be mine again when dead, for
Death can ne’er claim all,
And so I watched the moonlit street, the
shadow on the wall.
The houses were all silent. Stay—that win-
dow yonder there
Sends forth an orange challenge from a
single night-light’s flare!
A figure leans across the sill, across the
wide, white bed ;
’Twas but a month ago these twain came
hither, newly wed.
I almost hated her, so close he held her in
his arm,
Where my man can no longer hold my body
tight and warm.
Then the pain clutched, and I forgot. I
looked not there again ;
Their joy seemed such a little thing beside
my mighty pain.
I grudge them neither life nor love. Both
freely I resign
Only to ease my man from pain, and find
him cold—and mine !
Once I had thought Death was the worst
life held for him, for me;
But there are other things which make
Death’s threat but mockery !
It seemed as though my weak hands held at
tension back the pain.
O God, send the black camel here before he
wake again !
The pale sea-poppies were in bloom along
the water-way;
The cormorants were gathering for the dawn-
ing on the bay ;
The silver whiting shoaled and swam, un-
witting. for their feast,
And still the moonlight blanched the world
and checked the rosy east.
He. stirred upon his torture bed. a furrow
marked his brow.
I looked between the open slats—the street
was emnty now. . . .
Far up the little mountain trail I saw a dark
shape pass.
And here a fallen slipper lay like rose-leaf
on the grass!
They draw the blinds across the way. an
empty bed to hide;
A bridegroom sobbing to the morn heart-
hunger for his bride.
And I. crouched low beside his bed. hear my
man moan again
A broken curse on God who gives another
day of pain !

M. FORREST.
Corsets and Sausages.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“TV X him!” sighed the advertising
I w artist, blowing a cloud of blue
tobacco smoke.
“Who?” queried the verse-writer.
“Mugson, the sausage man! And while
Providence is at it I would also like Her
d—d too !”
“Which Her?”
“The corset countess up at Chiffons, Ltd.
I would like them both d—d very care-
fully in the special sausage and corset hells.
That is, if there are such places.”
“Why?”
The advertising artist drew his pipe-stem
from between liis lips and looked keenly at.
the writer. “Have you ever done any adver-
tising work?”
The verse-writer grew red in the face,
dashed his clenched fist on the arm of his
chair and started to shout. “Advertising
work! My God ! Haven’t I just! I remember
a filthy little bounder once got me to write
a four-line verse about disinfectant. Look
here ! If you”
“Exactly! That’s why I want the sausage
king and the corset countess condemned—
because they’re just like the disinfectant
bounder and the rest of the loathly tribe.”
The verse-writer subsided and lit his pipe.
“Tell us about it.”
The advertising artist laid his pipe aside
and leant forward in his chair. “Last Satur-
day I got a ’phone message from Mugson,
the pork butcher, who is so dull that he is
practically half-witted, to go down and see
him about a new sausage he was putting on
the market. He had a sample of the thing
there, and lie gave it into my hand as though
it were a diamond necklace and asked me
to have a look at it. To me it looked just
like any other sausage, and after a liasty
look I thrust it back into his podgy paw.
I hate the cold, clammy touch of the
things.
“‘What d’ye want me to do?’ I said.
“Mugson looked pleadingly into my face.
‘I want yer ter dror it,’ he gasped, dangling
the filthy thing in front of me. T want yer
ter dror it on a willer-pattren plate with two
bits er parsley—one on each side. D’ye
catch me meaning?’
“ ‘All right,’ I said.
“But he wasn’t done with me yet. ‘Don’t
’ave it sideways like that,’ said lie, swing-
ing his bag of meat before my nose. ‘Make
it a sorter three-quarter portrait, like that,
if yer know what 1 mean.’
“ ‘AH right,’ I said.
“ ‘An’ put th’ sliadders in delekit like,’
moaned the dreary old wretch. ‘I don’t
want it mistook fer a black-puddin’. Don't
make it look too solid —if yer know what I
mean.’
“ Wes,’ I said.
“ ‘An’ don’t fergit about th’ parsley—two
bits, mind, not three!’
“ ‘No,’ I said.
“ ‘An’ be careful ter show it’s a wilier
pattren plate, not a common kitchen one.
A good thing re-quires a good settin’.’
“ ‘Bight you are,’ I said.
“ ‘Slioor you’ll re-member all that?’
“I said I thought I would, and asked him
to wrap up the dashed sausage and let me get
away.
“‘Wrap up th’ sossige!’ he screamed.
‘Wrap—up—th’—sossige !’
“ ‘Why not?’ I asked.
“He held the disgusting thing before my
eyes, and I noticed that his hand was trem-
bling with rage. ‘D’ye think I’m goin’ ter
wrap up that sossige?’
“ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I can’t take it away
naked!’
*‘ ‘I ain’t goin’ ter ’ave it flattened!’ lie
yelled. ‘I ain’t goin' ter ’ave that sossige
ruined !’
“‘What about a jewel-case?’ I said.
“The old brute didn’t notice the sarcasm.
‘l’ll git yer a cake box from th’ confecshlin-
er’s,’ he roared. ‘Though w’y a dam’ artist
is too proud ter carry a sossige like that
beats me!’ Then he went off mumbling, and
came back presently with the thing packed
away in a cardboard-box and the plate in a
separate parcel. As I hurried away I heard
him howling something about ‘two bits o’
parsley, mind yer—not three!’
“When I got back to the studio, Hollars,
my partner, told me that the manager of
Chiffons, Ltd., had been ringing up, and
wanted me to go along and see him at once.
I took out and arranged the sausage on the
plate, according to old Mugson’s directions,
so that I would not forget. Then I left it
handy, and hurried up to Chiffons, where the
manager took me straight lip to the queen of
the corsets —confound her! She was a tall,
proud woman in a trailing black dress that
swished like a fire-hose, her hair was butter-
yellow, and her job seemed to be to look the
whole world in the face and give it the
glassy eye. She gazed at me as if I were
dirt, which of course I am (we are all dirt),
and I asked her humbly enough what was
wrong; and she snorted and said everything
was. Then in her queenly way she showed
me a dozen of my own corset drawings, and
pointed out where the lee-braces were all
wrong and the other rigging a perfect dis-
grace to womanhood. I knew they
were all right, and that she was
merely working off a fit of temper;
but I had to pretend to listen to her
while she displayed her ignorance of art and
showed a section of a slim, black leg through
the slit in her trading clothes. When she
ran-down I parcelled up the sketches, said
I’d fix ’em up, and got out while a loafing
shopwalker with a frock-coat down to his
patent-leather heels tore at his lip-fluff and
looked like a fierce, relentless poodle-dog.
“When I got back to the studio with the
corsets I found Ruby, the little model, just
finishing her lunch. ‘I cooked a sausage I
found here,’ she gurgled over the rim of her
teacup. ‘Looked everywhere for the rest
but couldn’t find them.’
“‘But I wanted to draw that sausage!’ I
yelled. ‘I brought it back especially to draw
it!’
.“‘Oh, I’m so sorry,’ she said. ‘Wait a
second and I’ll get you another!’ She started
for the door.
“‘You can’t!’ I groaned.
“You bet that astonished her. ‘Oh, what
rot.!’ she snapped. ‘One sausage is just like
another. You wait a second !’ She slammed
the door and ran downstairs.
“In a little while she came back with
another sausage, and, so far as I could see, it
was just like the sample one Mugson had
given me. I smoothed out a wrinkle or
two, posed it on the plate with two sprigs
of parsley Ruby got from the caretaker’s
wife, and got straight to work on it. It
looked fine when I had finished —in fact, I
was so proud that I sent the boy straight
round to Mugson’s. If you will believe me,
that old cow fairly flew into the studio ten
minutes after the youth’s setting-out. He
had my drawing unwrapped in his greasy
paws, and his little eyes were starting from
his head with fury. Jabbing the meat por-
trait with one stubby finger, he roared:
‘That ain’t my sossige ! That's a dirty for-
gery, that is! Where’s th’ curves of my
sossige?’
“‘What are you talking about?’ I said.
‘That’s your sausage. It’s a faithful draw-
ing.’
“ ‘lt ain’t!’ he bellowed. ‘Heitlier you har
no hartist or else you’ve gone an’ got
snother sossige ter sit fer yer!’
“‘Oh, don’t be" insane!’ I roared. ‘Don’t
be a d—d fool ! How can a sausage sit—or
be different from another sausage?’
“‘ Diff’rent!’ he shrieked. ‘Diff’rent!
IJain’t you aware lievery sossige ’as a—’as
a liindervidjoolity—don’t you know that?’
“The old brute was getting on my nerves
by this time. ‘You mean individuality!’ I
sneered.
“ ‘O’ corse, I do ! Hindervidjoolity !’
“ ‘The drawing’s right, anyhow,’ I said,
trying to bluff him off.
“He threw the thing on the table and
jabbed another pound of grease on it with his

Zam-Buk Heals Painful Injuries.
Odd jobs about the house or garden, especi-
ally if they entail the use of tools to which he
is not accustomed, often result in a crushed!
thumb or some painful injury for the head of
the household. His wife, too, is continu-
ally “in the wars” while doing the house-
work, and scarcely a day passes
without one of the children getting
hurt in one way or another.
Cuts, bruises, burns and scalds
bring more trouble than enough as
the housewife has it—unless there’s
a pot of Zam-Buk handy. If this wise precau-
tion has been taken, each member of the
family flies to Zam-Buk for the speedy relief
from smarting pain that this soothing balm
affords, and the hurt is soon forgotten.
Zam-Buk is an ideal healer for the home
because it is perfectly antiseptic, a reliable
germ-killer (preventing poisoning or fes-
tering), and a natural skin-healer, besides
being so wonderfully soothing. Keep a
pot handy in YOUR home.

finger. ‘I don’t know this sossige! Hit’s a
stranger ter me!’
“ ‘lt’s an exact copy!’ I shouted.
“ ‘lt ain’t!’ lie screamed. ‘lt’s a pitcher
of another sossige altogether. And I warn
yer, young man—l warn yer ’ere an’ now
that that there sossige o’ mine ’as been copy-
righted. I want a por-trait of my sossige—
th’ one I give yer with me own ’ands—tli’
one with th’ beautiful curves ! Show me me
own sossige, an’ I’ll show yer where ye’re
wrong!’
“Then Ruby, the impulsive, put the fat
right into the fire. ‘Oh, that must have been
the sausage I had for lunch !’ she squealed.
“That old fool gaped at her. Then he
threw my beautiful sausage study on the
floor and howled: ‘I knoo I was right! I
•■•'■oo this thing’s curves was orl wrong!’
It tasted love-ly!’ cooed Ruby, who
would sell her soul for food.
“‘TFos it, Miss? Wos it?’ gurgled old
Mugson. Then they started a sort of flirta-
tion with sausages as a foundation, and I
went out for a drink.
“I had one drink—the first—by myself.
Then Bryson strolled in, and we had a drink
with each other while I told him the story.
By that time, Hearn and Spendle had come
in thirsty from somewhere, and the thing
had to be gone through again, because Bry-
son had enjoyed it so much and wanted them
to hear it. Talking to those fellows cheered
me up and made me see the absurd side of
it; so, instead of breaking away, I stayed
on. It presently developed into an afternoon
leeital, and I’m afraid we all had too much
whisky. . My recollections end with a dim,
hazy vision of Bryson leaning on me and re-
minding me that Mugson said the sausages
had curves—figures, in fact.
.“I must have got away at last with my
mind full of the sausage and corset orders,
because I went back to the studio after tea
and made several drawings of beautifully-
curved sausages with corsets on and parsley-
trimmed plates for hats. I know that’s what
I did, because I got half of them back this
morning from Chiffon’s with a brief note to
the effect that they had made other arrange-
ments for their art work ; the other half came
back in a grease-stained condition from Mug-
son accompanied by a threat of legal pro-
ceedings,, That's why I want Mugson and
the corset (fueen attended to by Providence !’’
KODAK.
All that Were Left of Them.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was over small coffee and cigars that
my hotel acquaintance grew irritable
with me.
“I don’t know where you get your quix-
otic notions of the honor of women,” he said.
“But your story is too strong,” I re-
marked.
“Well,” he said, “if you don’t believe me,
come round to the manager of the Trans-
continental Bioscope, right here in Sydney,
where it happened, and he’ll tell you it is
true.”
Now, it was a bit too far to the Transcon-
tinental, and I’d much rather believe him
than verify it, and I’m passing the story on
to you, and if you don't believe it you can
go toAhe Transcontinental for yourself.
The doorkeeper of the Transcontinental,
whose name was Me Johnson, was standing
in front of the picture hall in the glory
of his gilt-edged, chocolate uniform. It was
towards the end of the matine.e, and he
gazed on the passers-by with that fat air
which assured one there was a full house
inside.
A little man in a great state of agitation
came along the pavement and paused in
front of the doorkeeper as if he wished to
ask a question, but the words were sticking
in his throat. Me Johnson did not lend him
any assistance, it being beneath the dignity
of his brave uniform, and experience had
taught him that it did not do to help a man
to words, as it might mean a money request.
But the little man was not after a loan ;
he only paused because his mouth was dry,
and the words stuck in his throat.
“I wish to ascertain,” he began at length,
“if a lady dressed in a tight-fitting dress, and
wearing a black hat with a white plume,
accompanied by a clean-shaven gentleman in
a dark suit, passed in to your picture show.”
Now, though Mc.Tohnson looked a man of
importance in his gay clothes, he was only a
stupid fellow, and he said “Yes” instantly.
As soon as he saw the electrical change that
came over the little man, however, he saw
his mistake. But it was too late, at least
for Me Johnson, who was, as I said, a stupid
fellow.
The little man slapped himself on the face.
“Then it is true,” he said, trembling with
excitement. Then he slapped himself on the
face again. “This comes of being a shop-
assistant,” he went on. “If I had been a
taxi-driver this might never have occurred.”
“Why, what is the matter?” asked Mc-
Johnson.
“The woman in the tight-fitting skirt and
the black hat is my wife,” said the little
man. “The man in the dark suit is her
lover.”
Ilis features began to work convulsively
for a time, and he could not proceed. McJohn-
son just stood and looked at him with his
mouth opened.
“I have suspected for a long time that she
has been false to me, but I could never prove
it. That is the worst of working in a shop.
One cannot watch his wife. If I had been
a taxi-driver”
Then he suddenly broke off, as if he
thought “What is the good of ifs?”
“A friend came round and told me he saw
her come to your moving pictures with that
man. I went to the governor, and asked
him to let me off for an hour to see if it was
true; and he gave me permission. But before
I came here I went and- bought a revolver.
I gave thirty bob for it.”
He showed the revolver to Mc.Tohnson.
Me Johnson was horrified. He felt he ought
to say something, but didn’t know what
would be the right thing to say to a man
who was going to kill his wife.
“But you are not going to kill her?” he
said at length.
‘ Yes, ’ said the little man. “I’m going to
lull her first, and then I’m going to kill that
man, and after that I will kill myself.”
Me Johnson’s mouth opened wider. He
looked awfully silly standing like that, but
he could not rise to the occasion. In a
vague sort of way he felt that he ought to
be doing something, but he just stood rooted
to the spot, fascinated, struck dumb. If the
ground had opened beneath him he wouldn’t
have had enough wit to get out of the hole.
The manager came out, and seeing his
lieutenant looking so ridiculous and forget-
ful of his dignity as doorkeeper of the
Iranscontinental, he called out, “MeJohn-
son !”
This brought the doorkeeper to himself.
\es, sir,” he said, and came forward.
“What is that man doing there?”
“Ilis wife’s in the show with another
bloke, said Me Johnson, u and he’s waiting
to blot ’em both out, sir.”
“Nonsense!” said the manager, looking
towmrds the little man.
“Fact, sir,” said McJohnson.
And the manager knew when he looked at
the awful face of the little man that it was
true. He saw that there was going to be a
newspaper scoop that afternoon unless he
could prevent it. He did not think of the
papers. He selfishly thought only of the
disastrous result a tragedy outside the door
of his bioscope would have.
“For God’s sake, McJohnson,” he said
keep that man engaged. Talk to him. Don’t
let him leave the front. I’ll have to do
something.
He rushed up to the operator’s box and
gave some hurrried instructions, and then he
opened the back door on the right-hand side
ot the platform. When the reel had been
shown lie had the lights switched on, and
mounted the platform.
“Ladies and gentlemen.” he said to the
crowded audience as coolly as if no little
man was outside waiting to blot out his wife
and a bloke, I oughtn’t to cause this inter-
ruption, but there is a lady seated in the
hall with a gentleman friend. I wish to
warn that lady that her husband is outside
waiting for her, threatening to kill her when
she comes out. The management does not
wish to have any disturbance. I have opened
the. door on the right-hand side of the stage.
1 ms' leads through a passage to the next
Suieet. As the next picture, which is the
last one, is being shown, I wish that lady
and her friend would kindly go out by the
back way.- I thank you for your kind atten-
tion, he concluded, and bowed himself off the
platform.
The lights went down, and the last moving
story of photographic art flickered its
length on the screen, and then the lights
went up, and the orchestra began to play the
audience out. But where were all the
people ? All that was left of them were a
few old ladies and a number of children.
ROBERT BROTHERS.
The Girl with the Crimson Hair.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
mHE red light stands for danger,
The red flag cries “Beware!”
O love, you dimpled stranger,
Without a rag to wear,
Why did you send ’twixt sun and sea
That vision wonderful to me,
The girl with crimson hair?
At morn like live gold shining
It clusters round her head,
In noon’s white light refining
It turns to copper red ;
But sunset brings the ruby fire
And hushed eve, breathing soft desire,
Makes purple every thread.
When first I saw it flaming
My dull heart missed a beat,
Then wild, beyond all taming,
Its hot pulse, summer sweet,
Went throbbing like a battle drum
That bids the laggard victors come
To aid the foe’s.j’etreat.
The girl was not retreating;
T She bravely stood her ground.
Near by three cows were eating
Grass with a pleasant sound.
The picture ravished all my soul —
Ehe light, the girl, her hair, the whole
►Sun-burnished landscape round.
No jot of time I lingered ;
Straight by the maid I stood.
The sunset, happy fingered,
Fondled and found her good.
And there my breathless love I told,
In phrases that the Age of Gold
Made in some Grecian wood.
She heard with bright lips smiling
And large grey eyes ashine,
Fhe soul of me beguiling
To dream that she was mine;
And so she really seemed to be,
For e’er the evening dusked the sea
I led her forth to dine.
Thereafter summer weather
My rapture made complete.
Love-linked we went together
In tram and train and street,
And neath her bright hair’s carmine spell
1 spent my cash and fed her well
With all that she could eat.
The red light stands for danger.
Oh, girl with crimson hair,
You walk no more a stranger,
But fill an ample chair
In that suburban home whence I
Creep daily forth to earn and buy
The things you love to wear!
Meekly my load I carry
From dreary week to week.
No thrusts of scorn I parry,
But turn my smitten cheek.
A very humble worm I seem,
A ho yielded all for one loud gleam
Of braided hair and sleek.
But oft when sunset flaming
Has rrtocked the western skies
I walk in anger shaming
The color scheme it tries ;
I shake my fist and hiss and spit
And tell it what I think of it
And all its crimson lies!
