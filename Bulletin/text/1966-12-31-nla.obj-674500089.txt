Face of 1966
Australia
In 1966 the Commonwealth was
two-thirds of the way to its cen-
tenary. We had a new currency, a
new Prime Minister, a new war,
and a new orientation. We had
admitted being part of Asia, and
were committed, finally, to alliance
with America instead of Britain.
We welcomed visits from Eliza-
beth, the Queen Mother, and
Prince Charles; but also from Hubert
Humphrey and, overwhelmingly,
Lyndon Johnson. Australia’s Armed
Forces rose to a post-war peak of
61,000, including 8000 conscripted
men. With sorrow, we learned of
casualties in Vietnam: with apparent
equanimity, we accepted the usual
3000 dead and 60,000 wounded in
the war on the roads. Crime began
to rear an uglier head in 1966, with
numerous bank and payroll holdups.
Former company directors also went
to jail for prospectus swindles which
helped to lead to huge losses.
★
The 1966 national wage case re-
sulted in a $2 increase, with a
further lengthy margins inquiry. In
various States teachers, police, and
nurses campaigned for pay increases;
some police and nurses got them.
The year’s biggest strike, by Qantas
pilots, was outside the Arbitration
system, and brought the airline huge
losses. An Australia-wide drought
turned the 1965 $3B million surplus
Budget to almost a deficit; and
although broken by a late ’66, its
effects, too, would last for years. The
1966 Premiers’ Conference ended in
dismay when grants increases were
refused, resulting in tighter States’
allocations, and increased fees by
hospitals and universities. N.S.W.
continued to build its lottery-financed
Opera House and commissioned John
Antill to compose an opera. The
RSL, founded in 1916, celebrated its
50th anniversary.
★
The Federal Government shelved
Stage Two of the Ord River Scheme.
A vast minerals field was discovered
near Rum Jungle, N.T. First $ll
million and later $8 million were
allocated to develop Queensland’s
brigalow. Oil and natural gas were
found in Bass Strait, and Barrow
Island became a commercial field.
Australia’s birthrate was falling.
Thirty Federal trade unions rejected
an adult retraining scheme to cushion
automation. David O. Hay was ap-
pointed Administrator of Papua-New
Guinea, where plantation workers’
money rose to $4 a month, all found.
Aborigines on N.T. cattle stations are
on strike. The 1966 Budget predicts a
$220 million deficit. Australia’s Jack
Brabham became the world’s leading
racing car driver and manufacturer.
Troupes from Africa, India, Mexico,
and the USSR danced here last year.
THIS AUSTRALIA
Year of Dollars and Yahoos
SYMBOLICALLY the year began
with the abandonment of pounds,
shillings and pence, and the adop-
tion of dollars and cents. It was all a
bit of an anti-climax, really. The
changeover was such a cinch, and the
main irritation was the hangover from
the old monetary regime made necessary
by the time-consuming task of machine
conversion.
But it was symbolic because the theme
of any summary of Australia, 1966,
must be the switch of our primary
international allegiance from Britain
to the United States. Sir Robert
Menzies was, as he once rather ex-
travagantly remarked, “British to the
bootstraps”; Mr. Harold Holt feels more
at home in America than in Britain. Of
course, the personal tastes of leaders
isn’t everything, but a case can be
argued that the new Prime Minister’s
prejudices had an important impact on
our relations with the Old Country.
He was evidently shocked and disil-
lusioned by British uninterest in the
affairs of South-East Asia (Menzies
never had much interest himself, so it
didn’t matter for him), and he reacted
strongly, attacking them for their com-
placency and narrow-mindedness. The
diplomats were shocked and, according
to officials in the British delegation to
the SEATO talks, Mr. Wilson had some
very abusive things to say about Mr.
Holt’s behaviour.
The SEATO talks themselves saw
the British argue violently to make
sure they avoided any commitment to
act in South-East Asia, while reaffirm-
ing their pledges to maintain “a military
presence.” They vigorously attacked
proposals for joint counter-insurgency
action in Thailand, and refused again
to assist in Vietnam. Australia merely
received the reassurance that we would
be helped if we were attacked not
much help for a foreign policy based
on helping friendly elements resist
our enemies in neighboring'* countries.
America, on the other hand, became
more deeply committed than ever to
an Asian involvement, a commitment
appropriately pronounced in the Grand
Pacific Tour of the President at the
end of the year.
Australian politics in 1966 divided
on foreign policy as they had not
divided for half a century. The Labor
Party, which had supported the com-
mitment of allied troops to Vietnam
and which had supported the extension
of bombing to North Vietnam, swung
hard Left. May 12 was the turning
point, with the adoption of an all-in
capitulationist Vietnam policy by the
ALP. At the same time Labor spokes-
men began to get more emotional and
unthinking in their pronouncements.
Calwell sweepingly said that the West
had no morals and no scruples. Allan
Fraser, once a moderate, described the
Viet Cong Communists as “anti-colonial
freedom fighters.” All this was too
much for the electors.
The election, although late in the
year, was its pivot. Despite the distract
tions of a new political group, the
Liberal Reform Party, a wave of anti-
Government demonstrations unmatched
in intensity for more than a gener-
ation, and a concerted electoral at-
tack on the Government by intellectu-
als, academics, and students, the
Government’s decision to accept mili-
tary responsibilities in the American
alliance and for South-East Asia, won
The streets of Sydney


“Did you hear the one about 1933?”
a record vote. Sir Robert Menzies has
faded from office but the Australian
electorate has firmly come to grips
with the post-war world.
Mr. Calwell himself suffered most
from the return to the Australian poli-
tical scene of the unwelcome figure of
the Yahoo.
The Yahoo may be a laborer, a
student, or even a teacher; his position
in society is not so important as his
response to his alienation from norm-
ally accepted social goals. Against
rational argument he is driven to ver-
bal or physical force.
His politics may be learnt from the
extreme Left or the extreme Right, but
his tactics are the same in kind, if not in
intensity. He specialises in shouting
down the leaders of his opponents and
in showering them with abuse. And
his violence sometimes extends further.
Oblivious to palpable conspiracies
amongst nations and institutions which
harbor his kind, he is nevertheless con-
vinced that his own democracy is a con-
spiracy to rob him of his proper influ-
ence on affairs. Exit Sir Robert Menzies
and enter the Yahoo.
'J'HE , Foreign Policy “debate” aside,
the domestic scene was relatively
quiet. The State Premiers squealed a
little louder than usual about Canberra’s
miserable handout (up a mere SIOO
million), but they could argue that their
responsibilities were growing faster
than their capacity to find the finance.
Hospital services and education were
even more of a worry than before, as
costs and demands increased. Transport
congestion in the big cities grew even
tighter, making it obvious that a start
must soon be made on major freeway
networks and underground railways.
The earth yielded up new riches in
1966. The world’s biggest conveyor
belts began to hum in Western Aus-
tralia, loading a million dollars worth
of iron ore each few days into ships
bound for Japan. Vast deposits of
natural gas were confirmed as a cheap
new source of power, if only the bicker-
ing about the sharing of the spoils
could be stopped.
After threatening to return early in
the year, the drought was finally broken
in June, July, and August, laying the
basis for what will undoubtedly be the
most bountiful wheat harvest in our
history. But the Country Party, led
increasingly into alliance with manu-
facturing interests, pressed the Govern-
ment into radically more protective
tariff structures, abandoning yet more
of the advantages of international trade
in favor of putting resources into small
scale local factories.
This was a year of legislative in-
activity, and a lack of Government
initiative on the domestic front. Mr.
Holt and his new Government were
fully occupied with foreign policy
and with implementing one or two of
1965’s legislative leftovers. Aborigines
continue to be excluded from the Aus-
tralian population in the Census
count and continue to be harried
by a variety of state laws. Women
working in the Federal Public Service
were finally emancipated from old
regulations against their permanent
employment. Waterside workers got
permanent conditions and the wharves
were uncharacteristically peaceful.
Progress emanated slowly from Can-
berra, but at least it was progress. As
the year closed, Victoria, with a
macabre sense of peasant humor, res-
surrected the gallows and the noose.
Looking ahead, the Country Party
was left intact in Parliamentary num-
bers, if its strength was somewhat
in doubt with the possible retirement
of the aging leader, Mr. McEwen.
The Party’s drift in interest from farm
to factory suggested the possibility of
losing rural votes to the Liberal Party,
but for the time being, at least, this
has been averted. In the longer term
it must remain a threat, and indeed
after the Holt-McEwen alliance- is
broken there are several interesting re-
Face of 1966
The World
Asia: The Vietnam war continued,
despite American offers to negotiate
and peace appeals by the Pope and
U Thant. China tested atomic bombs
and a medium-range ballistic missile.
Lin Piao rose to second in China’s
hierarchy, supported by fanatic,
youthful Red Guards. India began
and ended the year under threat of
imminent famine. Indonesia ended
confrontation and signed a peace
with Malaysia, which had internal
troubles enough in its Borneo terri-
tories. Singapore prospered but saw
future problems in jobless youth.
Thailand began to fight insurgency
in its north-east region.
The Americas: The U.S. Repub-
lican Party, self-defeated in 1964,
made a notable comeback from
Goldwaterism in the 1966 Congres-
sional election. Polls showed a de-
cline in President Johnson’s own
popularity, despite feted visits to
Australia, Manila, and Mexico. Pre-
vious Negro Civil Rights gains in the
schools were offset by white fears of
Black Power, which included riots
in Los Angeles and Chicago, and in-
flammatory speeches by militant
leaders. Finally, a bill to stop housing
area discrimination was thrown out
by the Senate. 1966 was a year of
increasing stability in the Organisa-
tion of American States countries,
with no internal coups or revolutions.
Europe: Britain re - elected a
Socialist Government with a large
majority, but in several other capitals
(Brussells, The Hague, Bonn, Rome)
coalition Governments were formed
and re-formed. France remained
stable, a la de Gaulle, testing atomic
bombs, withdrawing from NATO,
strengthening contacts with Russia.
Spain’s General Franco planned a
limited step back to democracy and
monarchy. From the past, a neo-
Nazi political Party emerged in
West Germany and won seats in
Hesse and Bavaria. At Aberfan,
Wales, nearly 200 died when a slag
heap slid on to a school and houses.
Floods in northern Italy took a heavy
toll of lives and art treasures.
Africa: South Africa’s Prime
Minister Verwoerd was assassinated,
and Mr. Vorster succeeded him.
Rhodesia was given until December
to accept British proposals for a new
constitutional arrangement, gradu-
ally leading to rule by the African
majority. Near the deadline, Mr.
Smith asked for further talks, which
failed. Britain then asked the UN
Security Council for mandatory sanc-
tions. Meanwhile, Kenya and Nigeria
had riots followed by military Gov-
ernments, and Ghana was returning
to civil Government after deposing
Kwame Nkrumah.


arrangements which may be attempted.
Should the Left Wing make yet more
gains in the Labor Party, the DLP
might be forced to give up its attempt
to reform the ALP and join with the
Country Party to take over from the
ALP the role of representing the under-
dog and forming the Opposition.
The other question mark for 1967 will
be the Cabinet. The basic weakness of
the new Cabinet is that, however gifted
individual Ministers may be as admini-
strators, the Cabinet is woefully weak
on political sagacity.
Decide the number of Cabinet mem-
bers to whom you would turn for
purely political advice. Holt, McEwen,
McMahon, Gorton? Once you get past
these, you move into the field of ad-
ministrators rather than men possessed
of political judgment. As it is the men
possessed of political judgment within
a Cabinet who act as a brake upon the
power of the Bureaucracy, this is
a definite weakness.
OVERSEAS 1966
An Ordinary (Horrible) Year
By PETER SAMUEL
Nineteen sixty-six was an
ordinary year. For hundreds of
millions of people the quiet, un-
newsworthy struggle for survival con-
tinued and for tens of millions the
ravages of flood and drought brought the
pangs of hunger and the fear, and often
the reality, of a horrible death by starva-
tion. In all continents racial bigotry
and exclusivist malice created a myriad
of personal miseries.
Nineteen sixty-six saw no new wars
and no new faces, but at least a million
people continued to be afflicted by
military conflict and the fate of many
more still depend on its outcome. The
Americas were peaceful, Africa was
plagued by the familiar round of coups
and tribal fighting of horrible but
small-scale ferocity, Europe was quiet,
except at the Berlin Wall, where intend-
ing East German emigrants are still shot
from time to time.
Most of the military conflict con-
tinued to be in Asia, where Maoist
crusaders pressed on with their euphe-
mistically styled Wars of National
Liberation. In Thailand, North Borneo,
and the Philippines the signs of an
escalation from political to terrorist and
small-scale military warfare were ap-
parent. But Vietnam and Laos continued
to be the scene of the largest, dirtiest
struggle. Upwards of 100,000 died, some,
of course, for noble and sincere beliefs,
but most because of unlucky circum-
stances beyond their control.
At least relative peace and justice
moved clearly closer to being realised.
For the first time the tide of war flowed
strongly and continuously against the
Communists. They were unable to
initiate a single offensive of more than
battalion strength despite continued
invasions of Northern regular troops,
and military bases in the jungles and
mountains which had been invulner-
able for 20 years were subjected to re-
peated attack. Western technology in
the form of flocks of helicopters plus
awesome air and artillery firepower
proved obsolete the Mao-Giap Guevara
equations specifying the need for ten
counter-insurgents to succeed against
each insurgent.
developed the cliche that
the West might win the military
battles yet still lose through political
failings, but happily the evidence at the
end of 1966 is that non-military suc-
cesses are following at a distance and
sometimes hesitantly the successes on
the battlefield. Without military security
we cannot ever try for economic and
political successes. With it we can
try, and do often succeed. Under a
measure of military protection, rural
reconstruction and development is
proceeding: Taiwanese rice experts cam
help grow more food, West German
doctors can operate, the Peace Corps
can deploy its skills and idealistic
energies.
South Vietnamese politics grew far
healthier, too, in 1966 as a rundown
of its condition at the year’s end shows
unprecedented stability of Government,
nationwide elections, work on a con-
stitution, commitment to developing
democratic institutions, and renunci-
ation of any attempt to march North.
So the military success established the
essential preconditions for fighting the
non-military battles, and although
these are only beginning they are go-
ing quite well.

ment of the U.S. to a role in Asian

affairs. “Asia is now the crucial arena
of man’s striving for independence
and order and for life itself. If
enduring peace can come to Asia all
mankind will benefit, but if peace
fails there nowhere else will our
achievements be secure.” This is the
“Pacific Era,” proclaimed President
Johnson in his historic July 12 Sul-
phur Springs address, which laid the
basis for the Manila Conference and
the President’s tour of Pacific coun-
tries.
This capped a year in which non-
Communist Asia showed greater solid-
arity than before. India and Pakistan
remained at peace, if uneasily, South
Korea and Japan “normalised” relat-
ions; the new moderates in Djakarta
kept the peace with Malaysia, con-
solidated their power, and made the
first steps toward overcoming the
Sukarnoist economic chaos which was
their unfortunate legacy. The billion-
dollar Asian Development Bank got
off to a promising start. For Commu-
nist China it was the year in which
Mao and his “thought” were deified
and Army Chief Lin Piao assumed
temporal power.
Nineteen sixty-five had seen China
make a clean sweep of international
table tennis “thanks to the thought of
Mao,” but although similarly armed
in 1966 they went down to the Japa-
nese. But as the Red Guards said: “We
came to the stadium not to enjoy table
tennis but to do revolutionary work.”
So the revolutionary work of slogan-
shouting and social purging went on
apace under the title of the Great
Cultural Revolution.
j[N earthly matters things went badly
and little work was done. The harvest
was again smaller; all secondary and
tertiary education was halted; in a
general assault on pragmatism and
rationality a large proportion of China’s
elite was denounced, sacked, and sent
to do slave labor in the countryside.
China increasingly isolated itself not
only from the West but from the rest
of the Communist world and its pres-
tige in African and Asian countries
sank low.
Europe became increasingly intro-
verted. Britain, plagued by its econo-
mic problems, continued to make noises
about a role “east of Suez,” but deter-
minedly cut its real commitments. The
white minority regime in Rhodesia con-
tinued to hold out a symbol of Britain’s
impotence. On the Continent Mr. Er-
hard fell to German nationalists and
de_ Gaulle’s influence waned as the
novelty of his very ordinary anti-
Americanism wore off. In eastern
Europe there were further signs of a'
crumbling of the rigid Communist struc-
tures with dissent and liberalisation pro-
ceeding slowly, taking them toward an
Iberian degree of freedom. But in
Russia the trials of Sinkavsky and
Daniel highlighted the fact that “Com-
munist liberalisation” is not an in-
exorable one-way process.

BUSINESS 1966
McMahon’s Year
By J. C. HORSFALL
WITH the drought and defence
overshadowing 1 the scene it has
not been the best of years for the
economy. The new Federal Treasurer,
Mr. W. McMahon, quickly refused to
raise false hopes that a more buoyant
economy was possible—at least until
the Budget, when his fears that activity
was slipping further than was wise or
necessary prompted him to budget for
a big deficit. By the end of the year
his strategy was being rewarded by a
belated revival in consumer demand
which looked likely to gather pace in
the New Year.
Believing, as I do, that economies are
better run at less than full tilt (pres-
surised economies are prone to be in-
flationary ones and in consequence get
less real development done than they
think), the result of Mr. McMahon’s
efforts in 1966 are not all that displeas-
ing. An improved development result,
a more visibly strengthened defence
build-up, and more buoyant business
activity in the coming year may show
that he has been marking time to good
purpose.
Since, as it turned out, defence has
as yet not made the full extent of its
much advertised claim on available
resources, we have had the whole
economy running well below capacity.
We certainly have not pressed the use
of resources as hard as we could have
done, considering the strength of our
external position. On the other hand,
by holding a lot up our economic
sleeve we have managed to keep inter-
nal prices fairly stable (compared with
those in most • advanced industrial
economies). Equally we have continued
to absorb a substantial number of mig-
rants without full employment being
overtly threatened.
The outlook for 1967 looks more
promising for business and the economy
than this year proved to be. Externally,
our position is strong. Internally, it is
improving. At home perhaps the main
danger is the high rate of interest which
is currently acting as a strong deterrent
to industrial investment. While the
capital market is in good shape, funds
are flowing mainly into fixed-interest
securities offering these high rates
coupled with maximum security.
Equally, the banking system has seldom
been more liquid, yet borrowers are
deterred, again by high interest rates.
Finally the stock exchanges are, as al-
ways, ready to go, but while the dice
are loaded against risk capital, not
nearly enough investors are yet ready to
go with them.
Undoubtedly our greatest economic
achievement in 1966 has been in the
development of minerals. Even if it
was mostly American money that was
poured into main areas, particularly in
Western Australia, where new mines
and ports for the export of iron ore
have appeared virtually overnight, Aus-
tralian participation has been consider-
able. Priceless national assets have been
created whose fruits are beginning to
show up in the export returns. The
picture for 1967 is even brighter. In
practically every State new minerals
projects, now being pushed forward,
will change the economic face of the
country. Ironically the main obstacle
to getting some projects off the ground
(notably the exploitation of the newly
discovered oil and gas resources in Bass
Strait) has been Government obscuran-
tism. Luckily in most of these cases
Governments have recently been seeing
more light.
Some new big blots have smudged the
business scene to add to those from
hundreds of companies put into
receivership or (in some cases) liquida-
tion in recent years following the 1960
boom. The biggest failure in 1966 was
Cox Brothers after strenuous efforts
by the financial establishment in Mel-
bourne to hold it up. Meanwhile
numerous official investigators were still
at work unravelling the tangled skeins
of lost company empires; some startling
reports came to hand from them and
numerous directors from various com-
panies were held to account in the
courts, notably in Victoria and N.S.W.,
for their part in the piling up of
company losses.
As a carry-over from his fruitful spell
as Minister for Labor and National
Service, Mr. W. McMahon had the
satisfaction of establishing, at long last,
peaceful industrial relations on Aus-
tralian waterfronts. In a further move
to stabilise this vital industrial area,
toward the year’s end the results of the
Woodward investigation were being
crystallised into an arrangement for the
decasualisation of waterside labor.
Against this, Qantas pilots, at the other
end of the industrial scale, flaunted
authority in a strike which took the
nation’s overseas airline out of the sky
in an act of blatant irresponsibility.
The battle to contain cost increases
in Australian industry and at the same
time provide for wages justice went
through another round at the Arbitra-
tion Court, resulting in a two-dollar rise
in the basic wage. At the end of the
year a second round was in train to
adjudicate a further big claim for
margins increases. The separate hear-
ings didn’t dissuade the employers from
again submitting cases for a total wage.
JJEANWHILE, national figures
showed a fall in company profits
for the first time in years. If this appar-
ently carried little weight with the
Commission, whose decision put a
further squeeze on profits, neither did
another rise in retail prices, because
once again the unions’ claim for cost-of-
living adjustments to the basic wage
failed.
The malaise in company profits
made poor reading on the nation’s
stock exchanges, where prices and
activity remained depressed until near
the end of the year, when the Federal
election result and signs of improving
business activity (particularly in retail
trade) lifted industrial share prices to
their peaks for the year. Even so, share
prices, at which fairly competitive
yields are now offering, continue to be
pegged back by high yields still going
on bonds and fixed-interest securities.
Their best hopes for 1967 seem to be
in a revival in profits and a reduction
in bond rates, which, going on recent
moves by the Reserve Bank, is a dis-
tinct possibility in the February loan.


The Legend of Ned Kelly
A vicious arch-bully with dingo eyes
By M. H. ELLIS
Ned Kelly
From THE BULLETIN, July 10, 1880
resurgence of the Ned Kelly
legend each year since he was'
hanged on November 11, 86 years ago,
stresses the enigma why one of the most
decent, law-abiding peoples in the world
should make a national hero of one of
the most cold-blooded, egotistical, and
utterly self-centred criminals who ever
decorated the end of a rope in an Aus-
tralian jail.
His frankness in turpitude, his utter
vengefulness, his cruelty, his cold-
blooded lack of regret at the wiping
out of the lives of decent men can only
repel even an unfastidious mind. Yet
his spirit has been extolled as the spirit
of Australia, his animal lawlessness has
been held up as a renewal of the spirit
of Eureka.
A larrikin who at 15 thought nothing
of sending an obscene token to a
woman, who was unmoved when his
sub-human brother, Dan, was convicted
of an assault on another woman, and
who could glory in the fact that he
could pull a constable down in the
dust of a street and, in his own boast-
ful written words, “straddled him and
root both spurs into his thighs,” is held
up as a man whose name became “more
widely known than that of any other
in Australia ... as a symbol of des-
perate Courage, tragically misdirected
but forever memorable.”
There is not one single fact in his
record that calls for admiration or
approval, not one act of generosity apart
from his distribution of stolen property
among his own family and band of
unlovely associates, most of whom were
as bad as himself, living in an atmos-
phere smelling highly of criminality,
sly grog, and utter disrespect for other
people’s lives and properties a bully-
ing, drunken, constantly peace-disturb-
ing community which terrorised the
main highway through Victoria to the
Murray River for a matter of 25 years,
with the limited police powerless to curb
them and most of the little wayside
settlers either sharing in the loot or
too terrified to join in extirpating them.
Other bushrangers, such as Ben Hall,
had some lovable qualities, or at least
a bold and careless courage. But the
main characteristic of Kelly, who is the
hero of the phrase “as game as Ned
Kelly,” was a stratagem: to sneak up
on a little town while it was half asleep
and when the police were away from
, their arms; to sneak up on a camp
where police were cooking and wipe
them out like dingoes, if possible; to
decoy a double-dealing informer into
a position in which he could be shot
without danger to themselves and in
front of his womenfolk; to spur a police-
man while he was on the ground to
skulk in the scrubs for months together
these were the Kelly tactics.
No bold incursions into towns wide
awake, no bailing-up of coaches on the
highroad, none of the dashing tactics of
the Clarke Brothers for young Mr.
Kelly. He was a thug, a man after the
heart of the American gangster, a man
who if he had been born in Chicago in
the early part of this century might well
have found regular employment as one
of A 1 Capone’s gunmen.
He was a compulsive, psychopathic
murderer, an equally compulsive loud-
mouthed boaster who subjected his
audiences of prisoners in such places as
Jerilderie to harangues about his
wrongs, through which ran a whining
note of self-pity, with the overlay of
megalomania, that led him to tell Scott,
the bank manager at Euroa, after he
had robbed him: “The country belongs
to us. We can go any road we like.”
The Kellys were bred on the male
side, of one of those types of Irish youths
whom Thackeray encountered in County
Tipperary in 1842, the year after the
father of Ned was sent to Van Diemen’s
Land for stealing two pigs bright
“schamers” who seemed to be soulfully
contemplating the beauties of the moon-
light, but were actually contemplating
what turpitude they could commit with
the least danger of v their cowardly hides.
The other half of the mixture of Ned
Kelly’s blood was that of Quinn from
Cork, a brood which felt it was in dis-
grace during the years between 1850'
and 1880 if it did not have one of its
limbs in Pentridge or Beechworth. It
was a tribe which thought nothing of
slugging a constable with a stirrup iron,,
or beating a half-drunken adversary into-
pulp with a bent auger.
The centre of gravity was Kilmore,.
so named by one of the squatting Rut-
ledges after his native town in Ireland,,
and an Irish visitor another Kelly,
but from Sligo—has described it in
1853. It was “gave the idea of Tobber-
curry or Ballerodare . . . rafted over
holus bolus from the Emerald Isle, so
completely and intensely Irish was the

accent, and in the peculiarly Milesian

style of the huckstering arrangement in
which the shops were set out.”
From this district Mr. John (“Red”)
Kelly eloped with Ellen, the sft. 2in.
high daughter of Mr. Quinn. John Kelly
was scarcely a worthy son-in-law of the
Quinns and chalked up only one con-
viction in Australia before he died when
his son Edward was 11 years old. His
widow took herself to a shanty off the
main road, four miles from Greta town-
ship, which the police insisted on be-
lieving to be a sly-grog or shebeen
shop in which the snake-juice was of
particular potency. Shortly after she had
settled there, her husband’s brother,
fresh from Pentridge, set fire to the
bark house of her sister when there were
five young children in it. He was
sentenced to death, but his sentence
commuted to 15 years’ penal servitude.
That was in 1868.
In 1869, a Chinaman named Ah
Fook came in innocently to the Kelly
shanty or shebeen h’ouse and asked
for a drink of water. There was some
altercation, and Ned Kelly, who was
14 years old and in company with a
friend and a post splitter, came over
and chased the Chinaman down the
road with a stick.
The Chinaman’s version was that
young Mr. Kelly had told him: “I am
a bushranger. Give me your money or
I’ll beat you to death,” then taking
10/- and striking him. This was his
first noticeable association with crime.
Of course, the friends of the Kellys
came to their rescue and he got off.
But in 1870 his career took a new
turn. In 1869, a little before he was due
to be released, Henry Johnson, alias
Harry Power, escaped from Pentridge,
where he was serving a sentence of 14
years for having fired at police who
had asked him to show a receipt for
a horse that he was riding.
He now took to the roads, estab-
lished headquarters near the Kelly pro-
perty at Glenmore with a price of
£5OO on his head. He was often seen
with a boy. The
suspicion that this
boy was Ned
Kelly was con-
firmed when the
police arrested the
latter.
It was recorded
in the local Press
that he assumed a
jaunty air in the
dock, sang like a
bird while in the
cells, seemed un-
conscious of his
danger, and “evi-
dently considered
himself a charac-
ter to be admired.”
He was charged
with two counts of
highway robbery,
but app a r ently
only to keep him
in security while
they laid hands on
Power with the
aid of one of Ned’s traitorous and
criminal uncles who acted as informer.
There was no doubt from this time
onward that Mrs. Kelly’s shanty was a
criminal headquarters. Every now and
then one of her family got into trouble
for such small matters as clouting an
arresting constable with a stirrup iron.
Ned Kelly himself had a fight with
a hawker who suspected him of lifting
his horse, and he presently sent a
couple of calves’ testicles to the hawk-
er’s wife, enclosing with the parcel a
“note couched in indecent language”
suggesting that he was presenting the
lady with her favorite meat. The
hawker gave evidence that Kelly had
said to him during the altercation: “I
will ride my horse over you and kill
the bloody lot of you, you bloody
wretches,” and that he had swung a
stirrup iron and shouted, “Come on,
you old —, and fight me!” Kelly’s
own brother-in-law, jailbird and in-
former, swore that
he saw Kelly try
to ride the man
down.
So young Mr.
Kelly, who was all of
15 years old, was
sentenced to three
months with hard
labor for the assault
and put under bond
to keep the peace
for 12 months.
For indecency he
was fined £lO or
three months in jail.
To Beechworth Jail
he went to join his
uncle Pat, who had
attac ke d Constable
Hall with a stirrup
iron. That was on
Thursday, November
20, 1870.
Three weeks after
he was let out, Kelly
rode a mare suspect-
ed of being stolen into Greta and Con-
table Hall, who saw him and had ex-
perience of his ferocity, asked him to
get off the mare and laid a hand on
him.
Kelly sent him sprawling and (in his
own words) “found him as helpless as
a big goanna. I kept throwing him in
the dust across the street ... I straddled
him and rooted both spurs into his
thighs . .
It ended in Kelly being sent for three
years to Pentridge along with his
brother-in-law for receiving the stolen
mare. He had just turned 16 years old.
He was freed, with a remission of six
months for good conduct, on February
2, 1874.
For two years after his release until
he was 21 years old, he seems to have
led his only years of honest life working
in sawmills. But after a short stint of
prospecting he went into the horse- and
cattle-duffing business.
About that time Inspector Nicholson
came up from Melbourne and visited
the Kelly home, which he found to be
“an old wooden hut, with a large bark
roof, divided into five compartments
by blankets and inhabited only by two
girls of 14 who were very vague about
who else was living amid the “poverty
and squalor” which the Inspector found
there.
He sent one of the most experienced
and successful constables to man the
neighborhood “until this gang be rooted
out of the neighborhood.”
Various members of the gang found
their way into jail while the pressure
was on, but another series of the troubles
started of which, on April 15, 1878, a
new phase opened at the Kelly home-
stead when Constable Fitzpatrick, 21,
arrived and tried to arrest Ned’s brother,
Dan. There was a warrant out for Ned
at the time, but he later swore that he
was hundreds of miles away.
Whatever happened nobody seems

PLATE No. 1: "The Laughing Cavalier"/ Frans Hals. (Holland)
The exact date of Frans Hals' birth is not known. He is believed to have been born in
Antwerp around 1580, following his parents'flight from the besieged city of Haarlem. □ Some
twenty years later, the family returned to Haarlem, and it is from this period that the first
reliable information on Hals' career emerges, with his portraits of officers of the local
archery guilds. □ Commissions came readily and regularly to Hals, but, indifferent to renown,
he painted as and when he pleased. "The Laughing Cavalier", his most popular picture, is a
good example of the painter's approach to his work. As in most of his portraits, the pre-
dominant facial expression is one of laughter. Din spite of the carefree spirit which he shared
with his favourite sitters, Hals won for himself a place in Dutch portraiture second only to
Rembrandt. The animation of his painting, the total confidence with which his brush could
produce full-blooded vitality, is evident in almost all of his works. □ Hals'mismanagement
of the money he earned destined him to end his days in poverty, an inmate of the Old Men's
Almshouses.

exactly to know. Fitzpatrick seems to
have mistaken somebody else for Ned,
but he was certainly manhandled and,
if he was untruthful in saying he was
fired on during a series of strange
domestic events, he received injuries
which a doctor said might have been
bullet wounds.
At any rate, warrants were soon out
for Ned Kelly and Daniel Kelly on
charges of having wounded Constable
Fitzpatrick with intent to murder.
The police knew that he and Dan
were in the Wombat Ranges (where
they had been joined by Steve Hart and
Joe Byrne, who were interested in the
sly-grog trade). Inspector Sadlier, who
took charge of the operation of winkling
them out, decided to send a patrol of
four plainclothesmen from Mansfield,
ostensibly prospectors, to establish a
depot at Stringybark Creek, from which
they would make reconnaissances into
the adjacent wild country and frighten
the two outlaws into moving into the
arms of another uniformed patrol from
Greta. The patrols both set out at the
same time on the early morning of
October 25, 1878..
The Mansfield patrol was led by
Sergeant Kennedy, 36, father of five
children, the youngest a babe in arms.
He was from Westmeath. Constable
Thomas Mclntyre, 32, hailed from
Belfast. Constable Lonigan, who knew
the Kellys, was from Sligo, hnd Con-
stable Scanlon from Lake View, Kil-
larney. They were all in their thirties
the Kellys were 23 and 17 respect-
ively.
They camped in a clearing where
prospectors had camped before them.
Next morning Kennedy and Scanlon
went out on their horses. They were
away about eight hours.
The other two spent their time in
camp Lonigan reading while
Mclntyre baked bread and shot parrots
down by the creek. This was undoubt-
edly what warned the Kellys, whom
they believed to be ten miles away,
that they were there.
Taking their guns, the two Kellys
sneaked up on the police camp. Lonigan
was armed with his revolver. Mclntyre,
unarmed, was cooking the evening meal.
When Lonigan, who had jumped be-
hind a log, put his head up to take aim
with his revolver, Ned blasted with his
shotgun. Lonigan fell dead.
When Kennedy returned, Mclntyre
called out to him that he had better
surrender, as they were surrounded. He
thought it a joke, but Kelly’s order to
“bail up” sent him flying off his horse
and behind a tree. Scanlon, who had a
rifle on a sling, plunged forward and
was at once shot dead. The two Kellys
and Kennedy then fought a duel in
which the latter nearly killed Dan
Kelly and, even more nearly, Ned, who
at last shot him beneath the armpit. He
put a second bullet through his chest.
Meanwhile Mclntyre had jumped on
Kennedy’s horse and gone off at a
gallop.
The attitude of chroniclers to what
follows is amazing. Kennedy was in a
welter of blood, seriously wounded. It
shows Kelly’s real quality as a heartless,
pyschopathic killer, as merciless as a
wild animal.
H E knew that. Mclntyre had escaped
and would bring help. He knew that
it would not have been long coming.
But the “humane” fellow could not
leave Kennedy “perhaps to be torn by
dingoes or ants or perish of thirst.” He
“did what he would have done to a
horse or a bullock put him out of
his agony shot him through the
heart,” in spite of his pleas to be
allowed to live to see his wife and
children.
The subsequent adventures of the
four outlaws have nothing glorious
about them, any more than the flaunt-
ing of their ill-gotten gains by their
flash womenfolk. Officially outlaws
now, whom anybody could shoot, and
with large rewards on their heads, they
spent exactly two years nearly all
skulking in the bush before they were
laid by the heels at Glenrowan.
The sticking-up of Faithful Creek
Station on December 9, 1878, and of
the Bank of New South Wales at
Euroa on December 10, 1878, were
feats transcended by the best of the
New South Wales bushrangers. The
sticking-up of the isolated little town
of Jerilderie, the holding of the inhabi-
tants at gunpoint, was perhaps a
theatrical display in the best tradition
of Italian hill banditry. How kind they
were to the women and children, how
polite to everybody! But had the father
or brother or husband of one of those
women and children put one finger out
of place, he knew he would be mown
down with utter ruthlessness.
That was in February, 1879. From
then on now till June 1880, they were
fugitives, not daring to show their noses.
As for the conception of the Glen-
rowan affair, the vicious ruthlessness
that lay behind the planning of that
was matched by the insane paranoiac
evidence in the Kelly autobiography,
•by the useless ploughshare armor, by
the insane revengeful bravado in which
plans were made to wipe out a police
party by derailing a train, following
the coldly planned murder of their
accomplice Aaron Sherritt when he
turned informer, and summoned into
the dark a few days before the fateful
June 28-29, 1880.
The boldness of a plan which en-
visioned a pitched battle with a train-
load of disorganised police, the slaying
of as many of the latter as possible,
the kidnapping of the Police Com-
mandant to hold hostage until Mrs.
Kelly was released from jail, were con-
ceptions of a madman.
I have met numerous people who
knew or saw Ned Kelly, who was only
25 years old when they hanged him.
Most of them agree that his death mask
and some of his jail photographs are
speaking likenesses of the real man.
They present cruelty and cunning only
equalled by that of his degenerate
brother Dan, who perished in the fires
at Glenrowan.
Two conversations of him I remember
particularly. Inspector O’Sullivan of the
Queensland Police described him as
having “dingo eyes.” I had a conversa-
tion about this with Dr. (Sir) Charles
Ryan in London in 1926. Dr. Ryan had
attended Kelly. I asked about his eyes.
He said: “Yes. He had a rare type of
eyes ‘alexandrite’ eyes that sometimes
glowed a startling crimson when he
became excited.”
Everything about the Kellys that I
can discover was base, vicious, and
undesirable. Ned was an arch-bully,
menacing, vain, cruel, predatory, more
like a wolverine than a dingo.
It is difficult to understand how
Kelly can have attained his present
status as a sort of national exemplar
of courage, transcending that of the
men of Gallipoli. There was nothing
sporting or gallant about him. Power-
ful indeed, the power of nationalist
propaganda and the imagination of the
poets and Irish romanticists who have
extolled him.

Pieter de Hooch was born in Rotterdam in 1629. As a young man he was engaged by a
rich merchant in the role of "painter and valet”. He travelled with his employer in this
capacity until he was 26, finding time to study under Berchem. □ His pictures at this time
were principally inn scenes, groups of young people at their leisure, and soldiers. □ De Hooch
is recognised as one of the leaders in the art of handling light and colour. He pointed no
moral and strove after no ideal in his work. He painted the Dutch home life that he knew so
well, rendering it faithfully, and giving beauty to the simple subject he had chosen by his
delicate use of light and colour. □ In 1655, de Hooch married Jannetje van der Burch, a
resident of Delft. He settled in Delft, becoming a member of the local Painter's Guild.

AROUND MELBOURNE
The End of a Pressure Group
MY two favorite lifts are at 533
Collins Street at the corner
of King Street, and next-door
in Dudley House. One wouldn’t say
they were exactly like Egyptian
boudoirs because . . . well, to be
honest I have never been in an
Egyptian boudoir. Rather they are
like miniature versions of Victoria’s
famous Legislative Council chamber
and almost as cosy. They were
installed in 1890.
They have much curly ironwork.
They are a little aged now, but I
rather suspect that the Dudley
House lift originally was all decked
out in plush red velvet. They have
mirrors on the walls for straighten-
ing one’s tie, and at the back a
long, comfy seat.
Like all lifts made before the turn
of the century they make a slow
majestic progress between floors.
While one is moving there is time
to make good conversation, because
the lift provides a very intimate
atmosphere. And for the shy chaps
of this world, it is a jolly good
chance to make the acquaintance of
the pretty typist on the third or the
fourth floor.
I remember 20 years ago a clerk
in one of these buildings telling me
that a girl had lost her virginity in
a hydraulic lift between the second
and third floors, but I have no proof
of this. However, the story does
illustrate their speed and their
gentle robust motion.
for one hydraulic lift
that has fancy electric controls,
there are no buttons to press. A fat
rope passes right through the car,
and an elderly gentleman operates it
by pulling on the rope to start and
pulling on the rope to stop. When
I rode in one of these lifts for the
first time as a 19-year-old, I thought:
“How dreadful! This poor, gentle
old man has to haul us up to the
third floor by sheer muscle power.
Could there be a worse example of
sweated labor under this heartless
system of capitalism?”
That was before I knew about the
hydraulic system. Indeed, it is
remarkable how few people in
Melbourne and Sydney do know
about their hydraulic systems. Ours
received a death sentence to close
down on December 31. This week,
in order to pay my last respects,
I hurried down to the Melbourne
City Council power house in Spencer
Street to see the Hydraulic Super-
intendent, Mr. K. Sandy.
IVlr. Sandy said: “It looks as if
we will get a six months’ reprieve,”
and he showed me a circular which
had gone out to all customers. If
they agree to be liable for all dam-
ages the service will continue until
June 30 to give them more time to
install electric lifts.
The death sentence came about
because back in 1962 there was a
pipe burst. This flooded the base-
ment of a toy dealer; he sued the
City Council and won £lOOO in
damages. The Council was so
shocked by this it decided to close
down the system.
Mr. Sandy explained that there
were 20 miles of cast iron piping
under the city which operated at a
pressure of 8001 b. to the square inch.
Now there were only about 100 lifts
left and only eight of them were
for passengers. The rest were for
goods. Ah, but I didn’t want to get
the idea that hydraulic power was
just for lifts.
He said it was used for wool
presses and cranes down at the
docks. Banks like the National and
Commonwealth in Collins Street
still had little hydraulic money lifts.
In the old days the stages at the
Regent and the State used to work
by hydraulic power and so did the
organ consoles. Of course, one could
remember the Wurlitzer in a pool
of light superbly emerging out of
nowhere, the same majestic action.
Mr. Sandy said the hydraulic sys-
tem, under a private company, first
“Going down . .. ?”
went into action in 1889. It was
considered one of the wonders of
the age like electric light and the
cable tram. However, there had been
hydraulic lifts in the early town.
Thereupon Mr. Sandy produced a
rare and wonderful document, “The
Select Committee of the Legislative
Assembly upon the Hydraulic Sys-
tem Bill, Session 1887.” A series of
witnesses appeared to plead with the
committee.
JpIRST there was William Frank
Hall, vice-president of Otis
Brothers & Co., New York City. He
pointed out that his company had
installed between 4000 and 5000 lifts
in New York and they were all hyd-
raulic. Why, he said, tall buildings
were getting quite common.
And he added: “A great many
people in Sydney and Melbourne
have rather questioned me when I
said that 10- and 12-storey buildings
were getting to be the rule in New
York, Chicago, and other cities, so I
telegraphed for some photographs.”
Thereupon the witness produced the
irrefutable evidence, photographs of
12-storey buildings, and he ex-
plained how in the old days it was
impossible to rent the upper floors,
but with the wonder of Otis lifts the
upper floors were most sought after.
Mr. Hall explained that the tallest
buildings in Melbourne were Mr.
Fink’s nine-storey building in Eliza-
beth Street and the Federal Coffee
Palace. But perhaps the most inter-
esting evidence came from Mr. David
Mitchell, builder and contractor,
Dame Nellie Melba’s father.
He said that the old system was
to run lifts off water pressure from
the Yan Yean Reservoir. This was
all right in the winter, but on every
hot day your water pressure gave
out and the upper floors of every
building were useless. The only
alternative was to put a gas or a
steam engine in the basement to
power the lift, and he said: “I know
a place in Collins Street where the
noise is so great with the engine that
they cannot stop in the offices. I
think it (the hydraulic system)
would be one of the greatest boons
that could ever be introduced to Mel-
bourne, next to the Yan Yean itself.”
As I left Mr. Sandy, he said that
he met an American up at the
Southern Cross Hotel the other day
who said there was new fashion for
lifts in America worked on com-
pressed air, almost exactly the same
system as the old hydraulic lifts.
Could he be another William
Frank Hall? Could we call another
select committee? Is it all too late?

THE LAUNCESTON clergyman who
is doing devoted work in providing holi-
days in Tasmania for Aboriginal chil-
dren from Alice Springs would, one can
imagine, be quite aware of the irony
of the situation. After all, it must be
nice for the children to see Tasmania
and equally nice for Tasmanians to see
some Aboriginals.
Summer Shows
AT THIS MOMENT it may be more
difficult than ever to estimate what sort
of theatre, if any, people want. Cer-
tainly, it isn’t big, old-fashioned musicals
like “Robert and Elizabeth” at big, old-
fashioned theatres. “Robert and Eliza-
beth” closed at Sydney’s Tivoli, right
on Christmas, and Brisbane and
Adelaide seasons have been abandoned.
But in the theatre as in nowhere else
one door closes and another opens.
This time it’s a tent-flap. On January
2 at Sydney’s Warringah Mall, a
hopeful American, Bret Adams, will
begin, with “The King and I,” a series
of six musicals to run two weeks each
until the end of March. The tent is
the remains of the “Henry the Fifth”
fiasco, but the Elizabethan and its
partners in the tent are now doing so
well hiring it out that they are thinking
of acquiring another as a money-
making venture. Perhaps that is where
the Elizabethan’s talents lie.
The Warringah season will be Adams’
version of American summer stock
theatre, and will be a more informal,
and less expensive, version of the
extremely successful local theatre-
restaurants. The Warringah area has
already flirted successfully with- live
entertainment for local and holiday
people. There have been jazz festivals
and the Peninsular Playhouse this year
is presenting the Independent’s produc-
tion of “The Family Game.”
Adams, who has American backing
for his enterprise, regards the season as
an experiment. Last year he went to
England for the same purpose, but was
somewhat defeated by the lack of
summer and by the fact that the trip
had to coincide with his busy time in
the United States. Australia, with its
reversed seasons, would fill out his year
nicely.
In America, he spends part of his
year organising (or producing as he
calls it) summer theatres and fills out
his bank balance with television com-
mercials. His main commercial is a
mouthwash, which, he claims with
commendable sincerity, is the best
mouthwash in America, although not
the biggest selling. He is paid a fee
every time the commercial is shown, a
blissful state of affairs which, he says,
“must come here.”
Although summer stock theatre is
stronger in the eastern States of
America, where summer is shorter, than
in California, which might correspond
more closely to Sydney’s summer,
Adams is confident he can lure Sydney-
siders off the beaches in time to have,
if they wish, a snack meal at the Mall
and then see popular musicals with
players they know from their winter-
time television programs. He is con-
fident, too, he can lure enough tele-
vision “names” in the television off-
season to appear.
His basic idea is better “merchan-
dising” of theatre, taking it, like shop-
ping, to the suburbs where people can
get to it more easily and comfortably,
and selling it better, even to the extent
of making it easier to book—a revolu-
tionary approach to anyone who has
ever faced the frozen faces at a J. C.
Williamson’s box-office.

raphy, “Responsible Gentleman,” writ-

visit, they posted notices pointing out
that these were not to be turned on
until we arrived.”
When Mr. Morley could spare time
from his battles with the brothers.
Tait, he took on other adversaries,
perhaps less worthy of him. One Syd-
ney critic described Morley’s perfor-
mance in “Edward, My Son” as.
“beautifully polished.” “I like that,”
Morley tells his biographer. “ ‘Beauti-
fully polished.’ Like a table or a pair
of shoes.”
Melbourne, he found a “boring-
town, an unpainted town, a town with
bad roads.” In Sydney he shamelessly
stole Seymour Hicks’ line and described
it as “Manchester with a harbor back-
cloth.”
Morley as Morley comes out as a
pretty hammy, stereotyped, but amus-
ing enough irresponsible English gentle-
man. It will be interesting to see if
he thinks we have changed; or if we
think he has.
Sideline
IN 1984, or thereabouts, when a
chronicler sits down with Western
Australian statistical records to write
about the age of iron ore, he will
note a jump during the 1966-67 statis-
tical year in the intake of British
migrants, a jump his computer won’t
be able to explain away by a bitter
English winter or a stepping-up in the
activities of immigration.
The key to it is the apparently unre-
lated fact that the Rio Tinto-Zinc Cor-
poration group wanted, during this
year, to hedge, their bets, to ease away
from a complete reliance on the buy-
ing of the Japanese steel mills and
get some orders from Europe. And
their method was to bring potential
buyers out to have a look, and with
them journalists from some of the
world’s most widely read and influen-
tial papers.
One result is that the name Tom
Price ranks in the minds of many
Britons alongside Ned Kelly, Don
Bradman, and Ming. That he was
not even an Australian, but a founda-
tion employee of Henry Kaiser who put
his name on the mountain RTZ and
Kaiser are now carving up that
doesn’t matter. What matters is that
after reading about Mt. Tom Price,
Britons are flooding Western Australia,
House after the best publicity since
the City of Light turned on the head-
lines.
The cost to RTZ of bringing out the
250 VIPs “the most influential
group of businessmen ever to gather in
one place in Australia,” as one writer
put it must have been enormous.
Obviously the company must believe
it to be a worthwhile investment . . .
and it becomes a classic example of
how overseas investment can quickly
benefit the Australian economy. It is-
only incidental that it is giving West-
ern Australian migrant recruiters the:
kind of free plug PR men dream about.


“Supporting a Column.” Cassell, $3.25.
Endless Time and Trouble
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
WHAT people used to ask when
I wrote for a London news-
paper diary column was “How
can you take so long to produce so
little?” Well, it was all too easy to
spend three hours at a ball before dis-
covering, say, that the person dressed
in that ridiculous fashion was a peer-
ess of the realm and therefore worth
writing about, which would lead to a
five-line paragraph beginning: “I was
talking to a teapot last night. From
her spout, Lady Blogg said ...”
Actually, once identified, it didn’t
matter what Lady Bloggs said. How she
looked was enough. But it did take
time getting stories. It was pretty hard
on the feet, too. And the nerves. And
any other sensitive bit of the anatomy
you care to think of. And, blast it,
Keith Dunstan’s book “Supporting a
Column,” wherein he describes his
column-writing experiences, brings it
all back. To be more accurate, rubs it
in.
Mr. Dunstan’s experiences sound
much, much more glamorous than
mine ever were. He travelled to Japan,
Manila, and the States as well as
around Australia. The furtherest I
went was Ireland for the day, where,
at the opening of the Wicklow studios
and in a haze of Black Velvet, I re-
member noticing James Cagney’s
homemade (bag-like) shoes, which he
said he wore to allow his feet to
breathe. I once went to the country to
ask the Duke of Beaufort what he
thought of blood sports, and I once
went to Luton Hoo to inspect Lady
Zia Wernher’s best china. I also
caught a Green Line bus to a stately
home for a charity fashion show, after
which the designer sued us for libel.
Otherwise, my beat kept me more or
less within a two-mile radius of Fleet
Street.
Mr. Dunstan and I, however, did
share certain things. One of them was
reaction to theatrical people, so splen-
did on stage and screen, so disappoin-
ting off. I thought it my off-day when I
met Margaret Rutherford with the
famous chin, but now with relief I read
she struck Mr. Dunstan as unfunny, too.
If his book had been around at the
time it. might have convinced the editor
as well. Harry Belafonte, on the other
hand, was everything one hoped for, and
well worth the fourpenny ride to Marble
Arch, W.l. Charlton Heston, too, and
Paul Newman, who could knock you
sideways with a look. But this led to
difficulties. When the column you’re
writing for is William Hickey you can-
not have him going ga-ga about his
own sex.
Generally, though, the theory that a
girl could reach certain people that men
could not was workable. I don’t sup-
pose Paul Getty would have been too
thrilled seeing dear old Jimmy (he
wasn’t all that thrilled to see me), but
after eight hours of intermittent tele-
phoning from the Ritz foyer he said,
“Yup, but make it snappy.” That story
worked out at £2 an hour, the cost
of waiting at the Ritz being what it was.
When Aly Khan stayed there, I waited
six hours at the same rate and then
learnt dear old Jimmy had collared
him in Jermyn Street turkish baths.
The social round took in weddings,
debutantes’ parties, christenings, the
sort of thing that does not sound Mr.
Dunstan’s cup of tea at all. I can’t
see him getting worked up at the
sight of champagne coming out green
from a copper fountain or a candle-lit
shade burning at the edges, but this
sort of incident made my night. Money
always intrigued our readers, and if
nothing else happened you would go
up to Daddy and say what a lovely
party Sir John, it must have cost a
fortune how much? They always
told. They nearly always looked to see
if you’d written the right amount
down.
My favorite waiting place was the
Savoy. The Press office could always
be relied on to service delicious food
and drink to journalists if required.
When American singer Jerry Lee Lewis
arrived with his child-bride it was cer-
tainly required. We all waited and
waited and waited to get the story, and
such was the public outcry at his
marriage he was forced to leave the
country, his tour cancelled. He re-
turned later, his bride “grown up,”
and public memory being short he was
a huge success. But I never liked inter-
viewing people in hotels, they were
never relaxed in unfamiliar surround-
ings.
Helena Rubinstein was an exception.
She’d taken to her bed with a twisted
ankle, and offered to make-up her face
in one minute without a mirror. She
did. We had a steak-and-kidney pudding
lunch and she showed me her jewellery
filed away in brown paper bags, stuffed-
in a cardboard case, each bag marked
“Diamonds,” “Rubies,” “Emeralds,” or
whatever it contained. It was all quickly
hidden when a waiter entered.
Mr. Dunstan’s columns on royal
stories stirred a few memories. The
best ones were always accidental. Like
the time Prince Philip’s cousin, Peter
of Greece, came to London and said
he would give an interview. “And what
are you up to these days?” I asked.
“Writing a thesis,” he replied. “On
polyandry.”
MARION RAYMOND'S COOK BOOK
The Odor of Burning Flesh
AT this time of year the odor of
charred and blackened flesh from
garden barbecues assails the nose
and affronts the sensibilities of any-
one who appreciates the potentiality of
cooking by direct, glowing heat.
This great Australian pastime was,
of course, man’s first step toward
civilisation. That some improvements
in this field have been achieved since
the Stone Age would be hard to believe
after attending some local barbecues,
where steak, chops, sausages, or chickens
are hurled into the flames exactly as
they come from the butcher.
A large part of the human race
from Japan through South-East Asia
and Arab countries to Africa still
cook their meat over open fire. But they
wouldn’t dream of sending it unadorned
to the sacrifice.
Even the dreaded hordes of Tartary,
barbaric as they might have been, could
teach us how to treat steak before eating
it. They never set out on any conquest
without a thick slab of steak, which
they stashed away under the saddle.
As they rode toward their destina-
tion, the meat became well mashed,
tenderised by the salty sweat of the
horse. (No monosodium glutamate for
them.) Then they ate it, raw. It was,,
apparently, delicious.
The Mongols may have set some kind
of standard for savagery, but let us.
not forget that they invented Steak
Tartare.
And when they got fed'-up with eat-
ing raw meat they took off their helmets-
— round, made of iron, with a turned-
up brim and made a fire with what-
ever, or whoever, was available. They
flung their helmets on the fire, and
when sizzling they draped them with
thin slices of meat, thickly seasoned
with oriental spices.
Within seconds the juicy meat was
cooked, while the gravy collected in
the brims of the helmets, to be drunk
as soup.
You can order such a Ghengis Khan
barbecue today in Japan, Taiwan,
Korea, and other places in the East,
where the Mongolians left their mark.
You can also buy the cookers now
made of copper to fit over a char-
coal brazier or even a gas-ring. (My
husband brought one back from Taipei.)
But the point about this is that even


the Mongolians did something to their
meat before cooking it.
Today, in this country, there is a
staggering variety of open-fire devices
available, from barbecues of every shape
to Japanese hibachi braziers, which are
designed to sit in the middle of the
dining table. (Get the charcoal over
the smoky stage outside before you
bring it into the house.) Anyone can
cook on these —and, ideally, the guests
should cook their own. All that is re-
quired to make such meals memorable is
marination of the raw materials.
This applies whether you intend to
grill your food on any of the devices
mentioned above, or simply over that
brick barbecue that you spent so long
building; on a Mongolian helmet, or
on that blackened old iron plate that
you keep in the garage; threaded on
skewers, or clamped in that wire gadget
with the red-hot handle.
And get away from steak, chops, and
sausages.
In Spain one of our barbecue favor-
ites was gambas al ajillo, or garlic
prawns. There are many recipes for
this classic Spanish dish, but mine is
very simple.
You get green prawns, peel and be-
head them, leaving the tail intact, but
removing the vein running down the
back. Bash them fairly flat, and mari-
nate them for six hours in the following
brew:
One cup of olive oil (preferably
Spanish or Italian Australian olive
oil is too refined for this); 4 large
cloves of garlic, chopped or pressed;
1 tablespoon of parsley, finely chopped;
\ a teaspoon of salt; and the juice of
\ a lemon.
This will do about two pounds of
peeled prawns which won’t go far
when your guests smell them sizzling
on the fire.
One of the very best barbecues I
know is made with lamb, and I got
the recipe in Tangier (risking my repu-
tation in the casbah to do so).
Get either a loin or leg of lamb and
have it boned by the butcher. (Both
are good, but loin has more fat in it,
which I think is good in open-fire
cooking.) You should finish up with
three or four pounds of meat, which
you cut up into cubes about one inch
square.
'J'HE meat, and the marinade in which
you are going to transform it from
lowly lamb into something fit for Allah,
should be prepared the night before
you intend to serve it. Into a large
shallow bowl grate two large onions.
Add: one cup of olive oil; the juice
of two large lemons; 1 teaspoon of
crushed or coarsely milled black pepper-
corns; 1 tablespoon of coarse salt; two
tablespoons of Madras curry powder;
a couple of bruised bayleaves; and a
pinch of rosemary and marjoram.
Stir all this together, add a large
cup of red wine (having taken a glass
or two yourself to make sure it isn’t
corked or over the hill), stir again,
and toss in the meat. If we plan to
have this for Sunday lunch, we mari-
nate the meat not only overnight but
right up to the time for cooking.
This is done by long skewers over
a barbecue. You can buy those Japanese
sword-like things, or even make them,
as my husband has done, out of stiff
fencing wire.
About eight lumps of meat on each
skewer; keep turning as they sizzle;
and brush with some of the marinade
while they cook. With this you can
serve rice or, preferably, couscous, the
traditional dish of Morocco.
Couscous is made of semolina the
fine variety. You steam it over boiling
water until tender—about 15 minutes.
(A colander lined with muslin will do
if you don’t own a steamer.) Stir
occasionally while cooking to prevent
lumping. When cooked, stir in a lump
of butter and add raisins and slivers of
almond, both fried briefly in butter.
Of course, I know lots of people
who won’t contaminate their steak with
anything before searing it. If you are
one, and are ever kind enough to invite
us to a barbecue, you will understand,
won’t you, if we turn our back briefly
to smear our steak with French mustard,
a sprinkle of monosodium glutamate,
and a caress of garlic before letting you
cook it for us?

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Blowing Hot and Cold
By RAY TAYLOR
IT struck me the other day that there
is probably less jazz played publicly
in Australian cities than there is in
downtown Moscow. As a matter of fact,
I think that there may be only one
full-time Jazz Club left. I went along
to dig this curiosity a few nights ago
and found it different from the last
one I visited in London’s Soho.
There the tables were stacked back
from the stand in tiers; an arrange-
ment which occasioned one jazzman to
liken the place to the Nuremberg Trial.
The cloakroom was dark with its mid-
winter collection and, indeed, it was
said that the proprietor sustained sol-
vency by the concession; which may
explain why he was always going over
the floor for pins. There was a bar that
dispensed hard liquor (a rare thing in
the jazz club world), and the lavatory
was always occupied. It contained, I
remember, a striking and creative range
of graffiti with the übiquitous “The
Bird Lives” taking precedence over
gems of pure critique such as: “Monk’s
. a Funk,” “Zoot for King,” “Stan blows
cool,” and “Who’s got the pot?”
The audiences (in the club proper, I
mean) were intense and very know-
ledgeable. Their feet twitched, heads
jerked, and clapped hands greeted every
solo. They were also at once hip to
any musician’s humor that happened to
be flying around, so that if some horn-
man, for example, was to make musical
reference to “The Queen” or “My old
man’s a dustman” mid-solo, he would
be rewarded with winks, guffaws, and
knowing looks.
“I prefer the Australian audiences,”
confessed ex-Sydney bass player Freddy
Logan, now with the great Tubby Hayes
Band over there. “They were more dis-
cerning and you played better because
they didn’t applaud just everything.”
Well, after the other night, I have
news for Freddy. These days they don’t
applaud ANYTHING. Not while I was
present, anyway. The place was very
cool. All you could hear was the air-
conditioning. In the dimness you could
catch the glimmer of spectacles, and
here and there a matted knot of art
students. Dead pans under biblical hair.
Hushed as a Scientology lecture in Mel-
bourne. Maybe as a reaction against the
boisterous Alfs in the Strip Joint across
the way; maybe in protest against the
cost of coffee (No Hard Stuff here).
Or could they have been just listening
to the music? Which wasn’t hard. The
trio sounded like a highly tuned stereo
in a small bathroom.
But the silence became particularly
tumultuous after the group had puckered
their way through one of those con-
voluted numbers which always sound,
to my untutored ear, like a prolonged
session of tuning up. They finished
and, well, that was the trouble. They
were the only people who knew they had.
Finished. Nothing. Not one clap.
Which made the three of them very
bitter. Understandably, they felt re-
jected and fell to muttering among
themselves; saying scathing things in
musicianese.
At the end of the set I asked the
drummer whether he didn’t think that
the item had been a little subjective, a
little esoteric perhaps? He looked at
me as though I had asked for a waltz.
“You gotta unleash your moral fibres,
that’s all, man,” he grunted through a
beard spattered with milk.
Milk is the “In” beverage down theie
by the look of it. The price of coffee
again.
A small man got up to sing and I
was immediately taken back to postwar
London. Not by the song, but by the
drape suit he appeared to be wearing
(maybe he just had a drape figure)
and the pencil moustache. He looked
out of place in there and he would have
sounded out of place anywhere. He
didn’t sing so much as blow, his fingers
grappling with an invisible bunch of
keys. I’ve never seen anyone so throw
himself into a song before. Everything
was going. Even his face was free asso-
ciating. He didn’t employ anything as
earthbound as words: rather he em-
barked on a series of grunts and squeals
pitched just everywhere. He stamped,
sweated,- grimaced, entreated, became
frustrated and finally very angry
indeed.
Imagine some long-lost denizen of
Shangri-La trying to cqnvey some
urgent message to a newly arrived white
man and you wouldn’t get near the
way he was carrying on. I was fas-
cinated. He really got to me, I can
tell you, and I began to accompany
him with the customary “Yeahs” and
a pretty fine line of atonal rapping
on the table. The spectacles around
me glimmered with hostility and affront
as though to say: “You want to do that
sort of thing get thee to the Mouldy
Fig (Trad or Dixieland).” He seemed
to go on for hours rasping the changes,
“OOO—BOP—BAPADO SH’WEE
DO—SH’WEE DOOO—” Then with
an “OY OY” here an “ILYA-A-A”'
there and everywhere a “WEEE-
WEEE.”
As a performer he was obviously
totally dedicated, because, between those-
soul-racking choruses of his, he would
lean over the pianist muttering strange
words of encouragement, move the mike
to and from the bass when that had a.
solo, and for the drummer he would
alternately put down and take up a
Rothman’s packet on the skins. At the
end of his one-man purge I led the
applause vigorously, but he seemed him-
self to be strangely let down. He moved
listlessly about the room from table to
table, pointing pathetically at his throat,
and whispering hoarsely: “It’s the
throat, man, the throat. Gone. No flexi-
bility sny more. What can you do?”
Then, with a final flip of his hand:
“Later, man, later.” And he was gone.
I hope, for his sake, to the nearest E N
& T specialist.
After that upheaval the band did its
best to restore some note of purity, and
even though I essayed, along with an
untutored ear, to provide my own scat
accompaniment from the table, things
just weren’t the same. But it had been
a good night and, in spite of the lack
of “play along” spirit and the coolness-
which I keep confusing with inhibition,
I hope that this little outpost will pre-
vail against those tentacles of urban,
vulgarity: The striptease and the dis-
cotheques. “Vive le jazz, hot —or cool.’”
FILMS, 1966
A Good Crop of Vins Ordinaires
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
ON first looking back over the year’s
films one is tempted to call it a
poor year; it would certainly be
difficult to choose the standard Best
Ten without including a few ring-ins.
But a more careful study brings to
mind a number of movies that, with
all their faults, were entertaining,
pleasing, interesting. This may not go
down as a vintage year, but it has
produced a good crop of sound vins
ordinaires.
Of course, there have been films
worthy of a place in anybody’s “best”
list. Mike Nichols made a triumphant
debut as a film director with “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, an object
lesson in how to bring a stage play
to the screen (though I’m still a little-
bit dubious about the interpolated
visit to the roadhouse). Nichols handles
his players splendidly; Richard Burton’s
performance was one of the most
brilliant of 1966, and though Elizabeth.
Taylor wasn’t quite up to the required
standard, she was nearer to it than,
anyone who saw her in the disastrous.
“Sandpiper” could have suspected.
Burton, who seemed to be sinking"
lazily into rich-voiced pomposity in-
stead of acting, .also gave a splendid
performance in another of the year’s
best, Martin Ritt’s chilling “The Spy
Who Came In From The Cold.” This
bleak view of the morality of spying
came as a welcome anti-romantic anti-


foryour particular pleasure
FUSERS FECTER “GALLERY EDITION"
PLATE No. 3: "At the Moulin Rouge: The Dance"/ Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. (Prance)
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was the son of an aristocratic French family. While still in his
early teens, he broke both legs. The young nobleman's health had never been strong, and
the injuries to his legs marked the beginning of a tragic decline. They never recovered.
Neither fracture healed, and both his legs stopped growing. Lautrec was a dwarf for his
entire adult life. □ Faced with this deformity, and the further aggravation of his own personal
ugliness, he retreated from the courtly, aristocratic world of his family and found refuge
in Montmartre. He became a habitue of the cafes, cabarets, and brothels, painting the life
hesaw around him, endowed with a rare gift of catching the "fleeting moment” of a movement
or an expression. At times his work developed an irony, but never a bitterness, that was
tantamount to satire on canvas. □ Lautrec's posters and lithographs contributed greatly to
the advance of commercial art. Yet they remained true art in themselves. □ Lautrec had an
intense love of life, and indulged it fiercely. It was this over-indulgence and dissipation that
eventually led to a complete mental and physical breakdown. He died in 1901. He.was 37.
filter


dote to the spate of wish-fulfilling spy
stories full of virile men, pneumatic
girls, and death-dealing gadgets; “Mod-
esty Blaise” and “Our Man Flint” had
an engaging absurdity, but “The
Silencers,” “A Man Could Get Killed,”
“Agent For HARM,” and the rest be-
came increasingly labored and deriva-
tive.
There were other anti-romantic, anti-
heroic movies: Bryan Forbes’ “King
Rat” exploded the legend of the stiff-
upper-lipped courage of POW camps;
Joseph Losey’s “King And Country” was
a terse, outspoken attack on the mili-
tary mystique with the whole force of
Army “justice” brought to bear on one
insignificant man who doesn’t know
what he’s doing there anyway; Kadar
and Klos skilfully developed the theme
of human cowardice and betrayal in
“A Shop On The High Street” from
bucolic comedy to inevitable tragedy
(though I’m uneasy about that final
dream sequence).
When the inroads of television began
to hit moviemakers where it hurt, the
vogue for long, lavish blockbusters star-
ted. The ones we have seen this year
here haven’t been encouraging; what is
the use of being ten times bigger than
TV if you’re a hundred times duller
(and can’t be switched to another chan-
nel)? Only the thoroughly entertaining,
beautifully photographed “The Blue
Max” justified its length and scope.
“Doctor Zhivago,” though often visually
fine, is a handsome, humorless bore;
“The Agony And The Ecstasy,” apart
from its fine opening examination of
Michelangelo’s masterpieces, is a sad,
pedestrian waste of talent and money.
“The Battle Of The Bulge,” by inflating
all the old war film cliches to Cinerama
proportions, made their threadbare
condition more obvious than ever.
“Cheyenne Autumn” does a similar
disservice to the Western cliches (with
this and “Seven Women,” John Ford
brings a distinguished career to an
ignominious finish), and “The Hallelu-
jah Trail,” which might have been quite
an acceptable comedy of normal length,
sagged badly because of the necessity to
keep it going too long. And “The
Greatest Story Ever Told” was un-
doubtedly the most pompous bore ever
filmed.
Of the supposedly revolutionary,
trend-setting films, I found “Darling”
and “Alfie” entertaining but shallow,
not nearly so daringly outspoken as
they thought they were; “Morgan,”
despite some good performances, had
an undertone of spite and heartlessness
which I found objectionable.
I confess to getting great entertain-
ment out of “Ship of Fools,” though
as a piece of filmcraft it was ludicrous.
In “A Patch Of Blue” the warmth of
the central performances brought
genuine feeling to a plot that was
basically a terrible tear-jerker.
The year brought several movies de-
serving more attention than they got.
“All The Way Home,” which finally
reached us with a cut of some 30
minutes (apparently to fit it - into a
double bill), had amazing depth of
feeling; it was a pleasure to watch
the too-seldom-seen Jean Simmons in
this and in “Life At The Top.” The
New Zealand production “Don’t Let
It Get You,” despite its naivete of
script and acting, had youthful exuber-
ance and dazzling camerawork. Basil
Dearden’s stylish, cynical spy-thriller
“Masquerade” was a good deal more
entertaining than many more highly
publicised movies; curiosities like
“Brainstorm,” “The Kitchen,” “The
Balcony,” and “Diary Of A Chamber-
maid” added interest to the year.
Comedy made a poor showing, rang-
ing from the noisy vulgarity of “What’s
New, Pussycat?” to the harmless
inanities of “How To Steal A Million”
or the desperate lack of wit of “Boy,
Did I Get A Wrong Number!” Thank
goodness for “The Wrong Box,” which,
as well as being very pleasing to
watch, provided a few old-fashioned
belly-laughs.
This wasn’t a very big year for
foreign films; most of those shown
were screened by film societies or Syd-
ney’s two (or rather one-and-a-bit)
film festivals, and so aren’t within the
scope of this survey.
In commercial distribution, Sweden
came out best, with Mai Zetterling’s
coldly impressive “Loving Couples,” an
astonishingly mature directorial debut;
and “Dear John,” a beautifully made
film of considerable appeal, comes as a
welcome reminder that even the Swedes
are capable of happiness in love.
English film production, though still
vigorous, shows signs of settling into
a sort of Tony Richardson-Richard
Lester rut. Hollywood’s ancient glory
has to a great extent departed, but
American studios still turn out the
great body of middle-standard films
made with smooth expertise which
don’t win awards or set the world on
fire but do undoubtedly form the
solid basis of the industry, giving a
background of agreeable if unmemor-
able entertainment against which the
occasional top-class film shows to
brighter advantage.
TELEVISION, 1966
Entertainment by Edict
By FRANK ROBERTS
Nineteen-sixty-five was the
year documentaries and public
affairs programs began to improve
and collect an audience. Nineteen-
sixty-six was the year local half-hour
drama series were born, prematurely as
it turned out. As the year ended the
midwives were making optimistic noises
suggesting the quads were doing fine,
but the evidence on tape showed they
were feeble, barely crawling. But the
baby-loving public was still willing to
give them a go; because, however repul-
sive, they were ours. In the background
one capable but unwilling father was
heard to say, “I don’t believe there is
a place for indigenous children in the
TV nursery.” In the foreground, Big
Daddy, the Broadcasting Control Board,
beamed on the offspring, handed out
exploding cigars, and said, “We shall
have more.”
And so, bless us, I’m sure we shall.
For when Big Daddy, holding his
stomach where it hurts after laughing
with McGooley, and with a painful
neck after nodding and winking over
the activities of those oafs in “Nice
’n’ Juicy,” says we must have at least
two hours of this from each channel
each month, we must. And by June, at
that. Some apocryphal person is sup-
posed to have said, once upon a time,
“Don’t get it right, get it writ.” For the
Control Board we could suggest the
slogan “Never mind the film, let’s have
the flam.”
Flam is what we have had in
“McGooley,” in “Nice ’n’ Juicy,” and
in “Australian Playhouse,” which a Can-
berra reviewer justly named “The Pat
Flower Playhouse.” And flam, in my
dictionary, is a “sham story, trick,
deception, or single stroke on side
drum.” Flam is what we get when we
try to create anything by edict.
The Board’s single stroke on side
drum can create the opportunity for
someone to conceive the situations for
a dramatic series, but that is all it can
do. It is no godhead. It cannot create
original ideas, nor people to develop
them. Nor money to pay the people
while they are developing those ideas.
Someone up there should read Gertrude
Stein. To be creative takes time, and in
television time is money. If the Board
says we must have local drama, let the
Board provide the money to enable us
to have good local drama, not the
rushed, half-baked flam.
Otherwise, with the situation already
existing in the TV industry, which is,
for its own reasons, screening and re-
screening old imported shows, within a
few months there will be no viewers.
The most enthusiastic of us cannot face
days and nights of program boredom
promising to stretch into the forever.
If “Australian Playhouse” and the
new local series (excepting “Homicide,”
which is also diminishing with time
into a series of cliches no competence
can hide) were a disappointment in
’66, there were many good moments.
For years I had wondered why, with
all the old movies around, someone
had not linked some of them to show
the work of particular directors, or
trends within periods. “The Golden
Years of Hollywood” is a beginning.
Some foreign movies have been shown,
another start. One channel has had
some fun with “Awful Movies,” intro-
duced by “Deadly Ernest.”
There were some good public affairs
programs (an inadequate title, embrac-
ing strippers, sharks in season, and


Chichester) on a variety of mostly
“shock” subjects, but visibly creating
new areas in which the cameras can
move without frightening officialdom.
Local documentaries, if there is a
difference (and there should be), were
competent, but I cannot recall any
sequence in them which was imagina-
tive. Perhaps doing things well but dully
is a national failing. Even with the
time, money, time complex against
them, surely someone behind the
cameras has occasional flashes of
imagination? Or are these frowned on
as making a dull production “uneven”?
One example, the series with Tony
Morphett on “Commitment,” in which
the camera succeeds in reducing men
such as Hal Porter and Geoffrey Dut-
ton to snapshots with voices saying
nothing.
Rather than more local production,
I think we need less “in the can” and
more that is canned tossed out as
worthless. Televising experiments that
failed is not fair to the viewer, who
has money invested in the enterprise,
too.
Next year, to bring this sorry plaint
to an end, I would like to get at least
as much from television as I get from
the morning newspapers as against the
afternoon papers’ flam. I would like to
feel that someone out there is making
programs designed for intelligent ten-
year-olds and up, and not for slow
children and adult morons. And I
direct this wish as much at the often
smug ABC as at the commercial
stations. In four words, some quality,
not flam.
THEATRE
Actresses’ Play
A Taste of Honey. Shelagh Delaney.
Independent, Sydney.
The Business of Good Government.
John Arden. Q Group, Scots Church,
Sydney.
Reviewing the original 1958
production of “A Taste of
Honey,” by Joan Littlewood’s
Theatre Workshop, Lindsay Anderson
described it as: “a real escape from the
middle-brow, middle-class vacuum of
the West End.” He also wrote: “the
jazz interludes by the Apex trio gave the
whole evening a friendly, contemporary,
and hopeful air.” Kenneth Tynan de-
scribed Shelagh Delaney as a “portent.”
How does the play seem eight years
on? The original impact has, of course,
diminished, mainly because as Tynan
prophesied, the new English drama has
flourished since. Nevertheless, the
central core of the play—the character-
study of Jo, who begins as a rebellious
schoolgirl and grows up quickly; her
relationship with her good-time mother,
Helen, who abandons Jo to marry a
drunken boyfriend; with the negro
sailor-boy who becomes her lover; and
with the homosexual art student who
mothers her when she is once again
abandoned, this time pregnant as well
—all this remains fresh and lively and
is treated with delicacy and without
sensationalism.
But the aspects of the play which
Lindsay Anderson found “friendly, con-
temporary, and hopeful” are precisely
those which have dated and now seem
gimmicky, old-fashioned, and tedious.
Jim Sharman, the producer, has dis-
pensed with the jazz interludes, but we
still have Helen addressing the audience
directly like a vaudeville comedian and
trying to organise some community
singing.
“A Taste of Honey” is an actresses’
play and James Sharman is fortunate
in his actresses. Helen Morse presents
an excellent portrait of the engaging
Jo whose rebellious schoolgirl gaucherie
is continually giving way to a high-
spirited acceptance of life as it comes.
Doreen Warburton is also excellent with
her blonde, overblown, selfish but
likable Helen.
In his modern nativity play John
Arden concentrates mainly on the
political aspects of the birth of Christ.
Herod is presented as the conscientious
ruler of a small country which is
wedged between two powerful neigh-
bors, the Roman Empire to the west
and the Persian Empire to the east.
Because Rome is the more dangerous,
he employs a Roman secretary to sec-
ure his interests in the west. His con-
sternation is great when three men,
whom he automatically assumes to be
political agents, arrive from the east
seeking a new-born King of the Jews.
The parallel with the present world,
in which many small countries are
caught between the great power blocs
of East and West, certainly sharpens
our imaginative awareness of the dan-
ger and tension in the play. But John
Arden does not force the analogy.
The same cannot be said of Peter
O’Shaughnessy. In last year’s produc-
tion, the Roman secretary was already
a brash, gum-chewing, cartoon Ameri-
can. But in this year’s production the
play appears to be actually set in Viet-
nam. At any rate the peasant girl in
the field who tells Joseph and Mary
the way to Egypt is apparently a mem-
ber of the Vietcong.
It is difficult to draw a line between
an interesting and new interpretation
of the play by a producer and an
irritating vulgarisation. But in a play
which strives to present political com-
plexity, and which refuses to see even
Herod as a black villain, Peter
O’Shaughnessy’s interpretation of his
own political attitudes does strike me
as a vulgarisation.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
FILMS
Two People
Dear John. Director, Lars Magnus
Lindgren.
HERE’S something so rare as to
have been believed extinct a
genuine love story, with an old-
fashioned happy ending. And it comes
from Sweden, of all places!
“Dear John” would be a notable
film at any time, but strikes a particu-
larly welcome note of warmth and
optimism after the Bergman films and
Mai Zetterling’s brilliant but depressing
“Loving Couples,” recently seen. Here
is a refreshingly affirmative attitude
toward love, a firm belief that a man
and a woman can build a lasting re-
lationship, that the brief pleasure of
physical passion isn’t necessarily fol-
“And I say you’re not half the man your father was.”


lowed by a lifetime of arid regrets and
disillusion.
The story is simple: John, master of a
coastal vessel, facing a weekend of
boredom and loneliness in a small sea-
port, picks up a cafe waitress, who ac-
cepts his advances as casually as they
are offered. Their chance meeting be-
comes a voyage of discovery as they
learn to know each other, though each
—John’s wife has left him, Anita has
been betrayed by a lover is wary and
reserved at the growing affection be-
tween them.
But Lindgren’s treatment of this
straightforward story is complex and
intricate; he puts it together like a
tapestry, first showing us apparently
unrelated threads, then gradually weav-
ing them into a rich and satisfying de-
sign. He dispenses with normal time-
sequence, juxtaposing scenes from past
and present to throw light on the de-
veloping relationship of John and Anita,
often repeating scenes as a chance re-
mark or event brings them again and
with new significance to the characters’
memory.
This fiddling with the sequences of
events is nothing new, of course; since
“Hiroshima” and “Marienbad” it has
become the exception rather than the
rule for a film of any artistic preten-
sions to tell its story straight through
from beginning to end. But too often
this springs from a desire to be modish
and tricky at all costs. I can’t remem-
ber any film in which the device is
used to better advantage than “Dear
John”; the scenes are arranged with
consummate skill to build up a com-
plete picture of the meeting and merg-
ing of two separate lives, and to illum-
inate the effects of the past on any
present or future relationship.
Rune Ericson’s photography never
adds false glamor, yet he finds a lyrical
beauty in the sleepy seaside town; the
lighting is particularly imaginative, and
the performances of Jarl Kulle and
Christina Schollin are remarkable, a
blend of down-to-earth realism and
tenderness.
But, for all its technical excellence,
the final impression left by the film is
that rare, elusive thing charm; a warmth
of feeling and involvement with the
characters that makes the watcher care
desperately what becomes of them.

television show “It’s All Happening”
has just been discontinued.
I don’t think my fans are in love

look the way they like a person to
look. I suppose it’s a form of love
but not the deepest form. I don’t
know why they scream, the person
who discovers that will have the sec-
ret of show business. You don’t hear
the screams when you’re singing but
you know when they’re not there.
I’m not in love and never have
been except with a dog when I was
twelve. I beliete in love. It’s a name
given to something but I don’t know
what it is because I’ve never felt
it. I believe one can feel for a dog,
a car, another person, or a girl, so it
must exist. I do believe in it. I’d
like to love one day. I most probably
will.
I don’t have a private life, which
is one of the unfortunate things.
There’s no privacy. If I’m out with
a girl the papers print it, but there’s
lots to make up for it. I’ve got an
Aston Martin. It’s the most expensive
car. It’s the best sportscar money
can buy. I take it for a drive if I feel
moody. I took it to 150 on the road
to Canberra.
I think problems come if you get
too much too fast. I was twenty last
year, I’ve been singing since I was
ten, I’ve never done anything else.
This is my life. Old rockers' never

PLATE No. 4: "Mona Lisa"/ Leonardo da Vinci. (Italy)
There are few existing examples of the work of Leonardo, but they have placed his name
among the highest in the hierarchy of art. So diverse was his genius that his attention was
divided over the whole range of human knowledge, and many of his works were never
completed. □ A lesser man might have been content to have been the creator of the world s
most famous picture—the "Mona Lisa". Leonardo was driven by incredible intellectual
curiosity that led him to plumb the depths of the human mind, wrest secrets from nature,
invent machines, build model "aeroplanes" and write the first treatise on anatomy. □ Mona
Lisa" was the third wife of a Florentine official, Francesco Giocondo. Hence the name "La
Joconde" by which the picture is commonly known. Leonardo worked on it for four years
and even then considered it unfinished. Eventually, he sold it to Francis I of France. It was
later moved to Versailles where it remained until after the Revolution. □ Leonardo was born
at Vinci in 1452. He died in France at the age of 67, and was buried at Amboise.

PLATE No. 5: "The Avenue"/Meindert Hobbema. (Holland)
Few details are known of the life of Meindert Hobbema. He is believed to have been born
in Amsterdam in 1638. □ Hobbema painted landscapes, striving all the time to reproduce
scenes of his own beloved countryside. Although his talent for landscapes is immediately
obvious, he found it necessary to have the small figures in them added by friends—Ruysdael
and Adriaen van de Velde. □ Although he laboured with infinite and meticulous care over his
landscapes, Hobbema's genius remained unrecognised. Unable to earn his living as a
painter, he reluctantly turned his back on art, and for the last thirty years of his life worked as
a humble Customs assistant. □ During this period, he painted only one picture. Ironically, it
was the one that would eventually place his name in the annals of the Creators of Beauty.
After his death, his works were scattered, many of them being incorrectly attributed to
Ruysdael and other landscape painters of the Dutch school.

BOOKS
Literature ’66
By CHARLES HIGHAM
PERHAPS the most depressing single
feature of contemporary literature
in English is the decline of the
public interest in fiction and poetry, the
rise in non-fiction, in the book by or
about celebrities who can scarcely pen
a letter, in cook books, religious books,
and reconstructions of crimes. Pub-
lishers, as we are reminded rather too
frequently, aren’t in business for their
health; and the American publisher,
who now produces the really over-
whelming numbers of trivial ephemera
which swamp the markets, has become
a factory juggernaut. The imaginative
work, the individual, idiosyncratic
novella or long poem, group of short
stories or avant-garde squib, is apt to
disappear in a shoal of journalism and
may even not find publication at all.
Somebody seems to have obtained the
idea that the spread of mass education,
of cultdre in the United States is
welcome, and that we should all be
delighted at the phenomenon. The only
ones who should be delighted—and are
—are publishers, of course, especially
since the field of literature outside of
copyright is far larger than that within,
and it now becomes possible to gain all
the cultural haloes without that nasty
business of truckling with agents,
authors, and royalties. Non-fiction titles
can be commissioned from within the
house, and indeed one now suspects that
most American publishers are run like
magazines, with books taking the place
of articles. A controversial title is seized
on, and a famous subject, a hack (or
sometimes someone better than that)
hired to trot out a quarter of a million
words, and a best-seller is born.
The fact is that the public for quality
fiction is dwindling year by year, that
poetry is already doomed, and that
authentic avant-garde writing in English
can only be launched by the kind of
pretentiously fake publicity that puts
across a Warhol, or the high-powered
public readings of a Yevtushenko or a
Ginsberg. This year has seen a tragic
dearth of imaginative writing, an
increase of publishers’ venality, and an
upsurge of patched-together “non-fiction
novels” to use the repulsive phrase
applied by Capote or someone to his
extended magazine feature story about
a murder case in the corn belt “In
Cold Blood.” In this work a meagre
but pretty descriptive talent disclosed
in his earlier works—notably that
engagingly decadent novella “Other
Voices, Other Rooms”—was submerged
in an ocean of grey prose, flat, feature-
less, and sterile as the Mohave, a feat
of memory rather than of literary skill
... It will earn him two million, will
be made into a film by the impersonal
Mr. Preminger, and has enabled him to
give a high camp masked ball to a
modern New York “society” which
must make the ghosts of the Algonquin
tremble in their shrouds.
Non-writers emerged in full force:
Lord Moran wrote an account, personal
and immediate as a temperature chart,
about the depressing latter days of
Churchill. This had all the appeal of a
tour of boils. Randolph Churchill later
took us back to better days in another
memoir. The Kennedy shelves groaned:
Arthur Schlesinger’s “A Thousand
Days” was the most fascinating of a
group which included Sorensen’s “The
Making of a President,” but both books
—while admitting the reader to a posi-
tion very close to the realities of power
politics—somehow succeeded in leaving
Kennedy’s character elusive, the mys-
teries behind the smooth collegiate front
not fully explained. It seems we must
wait for years before the hagiographies
fall away and the real truth is told.
A year, certainly, of the biographies:
Maurois’ massive tribute to Balzac, a
giant examined with callipers, Constan-
tine Fitz Gibbon’s life of Dylan Thomas,
a sharp close-up of a talent now begin-
ning to look rather threadbare, Russell
Braddon’s “Roy Thomson of Fleet
Street”—full of interest as a portrait of
ambition but still leaving room for an
independent work, written by someone
right outside the game, and unpublished
by a single Thomson newspaper. The
Earl of Birkenhead’s “Halifax,” a thick
grey book about a thin grey man.
And Monica Stirling’s clever, acute
picture of Hans Andersen in “The Wild
Swan,” Robin Maugham’s sober and
often fascinating “Somerset and all the
Maughams,” Beverley Nichols’ vulpine
memoir of that suave and gifted writer.
Fiction looked rather sad and under-
privileged . this year. Only Patrick
White’s “The Solid Mandala” (dis-
cussed in these pages by Geoffrey Dut-
ton) and Graham Greene’s “The
Comedians” —about an abortive revolu-
tion in Haiti, vividly seedy and wry —
emerged as major works, disclosing new"
aspects of their authors’ powerful genius.
James Agee’s “A Death in the Family,”'
Elizabeth Bowen’s “A Day in the Dark,” -
Gunter Grass’ “The Dog Years” all
showed their authors slightly below"
form, and apart from indifferent
volumes by Auden and the “New States-
man’s” absurdly overpraised, new Irish
discovery Seamus Heaney, there was-
little of interest in overseas poetry. One
minor pleasure was Shirley Hazzard’s
“The Evening of the Holiday,” a
Jamesian excursion into the lives of
foreigners in Europe, which recalled the
elegance of a better literary period and
was only slightly vitiated here and there
by the bloodless asbestos prose called
for by “The New Yorker.”
It remains only to mention Barbara
Tuchman’s massive reconstruction of
the origins of World War I, “The
Proud Tower,” Alan Moorehead’s
charming, not always accurate account
of Cook’s voyages, “The Fatal Impact,”
and Isherwood’s deeply civilised, touch-
ingly personal essays, “Exhumations,” as
well as a shoal of books on Vietnam,
almost all unreadable to the uninitiated.
And, finally, a plea for 1967: all right,
publishers, you’ve cleaned up: now go
out and find the new poets, the novelists
not in search of a quick buck. We must
not allow faces as insufferably com-
placent as Bennett Cerf’s of Random
House in a recent issue of “Time” to go-
on smiling for good.
Poetic Richness
By VIVIAN SMITH
ANNUAL literary surveys can be
unreasonable in their assumptions
and expectations, but a year which
can boast two important collections
from senior poets, substantial third and
fourth books from leading writers, and
a number of new books from younger
and emerging talents has clearly been a
good year.
Nineteen-sixty-six began splendidly
with the appearance of the “Collected
Poems” of A. D. Hope. Hope’s success
over the past ten years confirms a belief,
essential to hold, that only quality
matters in the end, and that when it
exists it will evoke response. His “Col-
lected Poems,” a somewhat severe and
deviously arranged selection, allows one
to follow the lines of his remarkably
consistent development and to see How
he has had to fight against some cramp-
ing inhibitions (“to suffer for a style’ 1 )
to achieve the energy and plenitude of
feeling—the charged richness—of poems
like “The Double Looking Glass,” “A
Bidding Grace,” and “Pseudodoxia
Epidemica.” There are books which
alter the shape and destiny of a coun-
try’s literature, and Hope’s “Collected
Poems” is one of them.
Judith Wright’s “The Other Half”
grouped poems around the themes of
death and poetry, and included a num-
ber of slighter sardonic pieces in the
now characteristic vein of her later
work. Like Hope’s, Judith Wright’s
poetry has developed and changed in
several intricately subtle ways, but there
is a note of authenticity throughout the 1
whole of her work—as throughout
Hope’s—immediately perceptible, hard
to define, which has led some critics to


Judith Wright
maintain that their work has not
changed at all. A great compliment,
this, if it is properly understood.
New collections followed closely on
each other throughout the year from
poets not yet at the age where collected
volumes are customary.
Charles Higham’s “Noonday Country
—Poems 1954-1965” showed the extra-
ordinary range of his development
over the past eleven years, with his in-
tensely felt allegiances to Australia and
his cosmopolitan knowledge of countries
as varied as Japan, Italy, and the West
Indies a cosmopolitanism reflected,
too, in the exceptional variety of modes
and approaches throughout his work.
W. Hart-Smith’s highly idiosyncratic
talent was fully in evidence in his de-
lightful and densely packed “The Talk-
ing Clothes,” which might justify calling
him an imagist Jacques Prevert; while
Vincent Buckley’s “Arcady and Other
Places” —perhaps the most attractively
designed book of the year —is his finest
book to date. This, his third volume,
showed him renouncing his barbie role
for poems of subdued and persuasive
speech. Buckley’s main weaknesses have
been a lack of consistent verbal fastid-
iousness (he can write of “the utter
moon”) and failures of rhythm; but his
considerable strengths can be seen in
a particularly fine poem like “Parents”
(the best in his book, to my mind). One
could not point to a striking line, re-
markable language effect, or even an
especially skilfully used word; but the
whole is a triumph of poise and tone.
Nothing draws attention to itself, but
fully communicated are the finely felt
subtleties of a relationship. The whole
poem “lives along the line.”
Among the few first books that came
my way, Keith Harrison’s “Points in a
Journey,” was the most important. Har-
rison has travelled a long way since
his poem to the art of Harold Stewart,
and while some of his poems tend to
be a trifle modish and derivative,
others show how very well he has
assimilated the Americans, and Charles
Tomlinson, in particular. I hope it
wasn’t necessary for Mr. Harrison to
become an expatriate to achieve his
present incisiveness and style.
Craig Powell’s “A Different Kind
of Breathing,” drawing its vitality from
the author’s experiences as a doctor,
combined traditional verse forms with a
typically modern violence of feeling.
Books of note appeared from Colin
Thiele, whose “In Charcoal and Conte”
was a series of portraits in the post-
Browning vein that Kenneth Slessor
first introduced here; and from David
Martin, who published in “The Gift” a
collection of direct lyrics; while “XI
Hunter Valley Poets,” edited by Nor-
man Talbot and dedicated to the
memory of Harri Jones, deserved more
attention than it seems to have received.
Angus & Robertson brought out
selected poems by Hugh McCrae and
Chris Brennan in their Australian poets
series, with important introductions by
Douglas Stewart and Professor Chis-
holm respectively. Clement Semmler’s
series of biographical and bibliographi-
cal essays on Paterson, “The Banjo
of the Bush,” was the only lengthy work
devoted to an Australian poet published
here this year.
As far as publishing goes, the present
situation in Australia is the best there
has been for the poet. There are two
flourishing and healthily competitive
poetry magazines; the major newspapers
are now printing poems and paying well
for them. The leading literary journals
continue to print sustained critical
articles and the ABC has programs
devoted to Australian poets and their
work. There is still not enough good
reviewing. Two of the more important
magazines have given up reviews alto-
gether (Hope’s “Collected Poems” was
ignored in several quarters); and there
is too little fully engaged and friendly
discussion of differing viewpoints. But
criticism must, of course, begin at home;
and, as always, every writer must try to
be his own best critic.
The Struggle for Prose
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
IN making a short survey of the year’s
prose there are even worse hazards
than in editing an anthology; not
only is one sure to be accused of leaving
out the best items, but there is never
enough room in which to discuss all the
material available.
Although Australian books proliferate
and often succeed, writers in Aus-
tralia are a depressed class, in terms
both of finance and prestige. A good
artist can make more money in one
exhibition than a good novelist can in
five years. The author of a best-selling
factual book may make in three years,
if he is very lucky, $l5OO out of a hard-
back edition of 3000 and $2500 out of a
paperback edition of 30,000. In the
U.S.A. paperback publishers will now
pay half a million dollars for the rights
on a book that has not even appeared
in hardback. In the U.S.S.R. there are
over 3000 writers who live on their writ-
ing, and more than 1000 of these are
poets; moreover, many of them are
national heroes. For us sardonic Austra-
lians, however, accustomed to bitch
rather than enthuse, the first rays of
talent are enough to make us narrow
our sun-squinting eyes; at a glimpse of
genius, we call for our dark glasses.
But writers continue to write, even
though they have no basic wage, while
their equivalent of a union, the inde-
fatigable Society of Authors, manages
to scratch a few more cents for them
from newspaper proprietors or the
ABC, and the Commonwealth Literary
Fund gives temporary slender support
to some lucky one's. While art prizes
are as common as public-relations men,
literary prizes are rarer than bishops.
The most handsome is the Britannica
Award of $lO,OOO, shared equally this
year by Hal Porter and Randolph Stow.
Thea Astley won both the Miles Frank-
lin ($1000) and the Moomba ($500)
Awards for her witty but touching novel
“The Slow Natives.” The Adelaide
“Advertiser’s” award of $4OOO for an
unpublished book was won by David
Ireland. The admirable Ampol Arts
Award of $5OOO for a young writer will
be announced at the next Melbourne
Moomba Festival. However, awards are
a random bonus. Some Government
inquiry into the state of arts and letters
in Australia is urgently needed, and the
Council of the Australian Society of
Authors, with A. D. Hope as president,
is doing its best to rouse those who
ought to hear.
Under these conditions, it is very
difficult for a prose writer in Australia
to be able to devote the time and energy
needed for a major work without work-
ing hours and living in conditions that
would make the average worker fling
his beer in the boss’ face. “Where are
our young writers?” people ask. “Doing
something else for eight hours a day ”
is the answer.
In prose there are writers who reflect
the world, past or present, familiar or
unfamiliar, in which we live, and there
are those who create their own worlds
from the reflections of the inner eye.
Australians tend to resent Australian
writers of the latter class, which is odd,
seeing that they do not complain about
the work of such writers from overseas,
Joseph Heller of “Catch-22,” William
Golding, Iris Murdoch, to name a few.
Yet we could certainly do with less sur-
face reality and more inner reality, both
in life and in literature. In this category
one work of genius appeared in 1966,
Patrick White’s “The Solid Mandala.”
Two books were republished, and a
novella appeared by another great
writer, Christina Stead. Finally, there
was an odd, shambling, dancing book,
a strange twisting of biceps and brains
by a new writer who will go a long way,
Peter Mathers’ “Trap.”
“The Solid Mandala” is the most pro-


found and the most disturbing of all
Patrick White’s novels. It is a book that
must, at the cost of lack of sleep or
rudeness to friends or relations, be read
at one sitting. (Incidentally, how
roughly most of us treat novels. A chap-
ter or two after dinner. A few pages
before falling asleep over the book in
bed. Imagine a symphony or a string
quartet prolonged over the same
amount of time, a few bars here, half a
movement there.) The twin brothers,
Waldo and Arthur, who are the heroes
of the story, are also the two selves we
carry around inside us, the dry and the
moist, the one who empties and the
one who fills. “Life is the twin con-
sciousness, jostling you, hindering you,
but with which, at unexpected moments,
it is possible to communicate in ways
both animal and delicate.” “The Solid
Mandala” is an uncomfortable book to
read, because one is not securely read-
ing about others but about one’s self, a
creature not so pleasant to get to know
so well. But the book is also marvel-
lously rich in compassion, a quality
White is sometimes accused of lacking
by those who do not see that his fury
and bitterness come from an excess, not
a lack, of love.
Christina Stead shares the same com-
passion with White, the feeling for the
insulted and the injured, the hatred for
the wreckers and the persecutors, but
she also has the same approach to the
novel as a stylistic unity. Prose is not
just a medium like sensitised paper on
which images appear but a part of crea-
tion itself, like oil paint on canvas. In
Christina Stead’s early novels and
stories such as “The Salzburg Tales”
and “For Love Alone,” both republished
in 1966, the style is as subtle and depth-
revealing as in her masterpiece, “The
Man Who Loved Children,” or as in
that haunting new novella “The Puzzle-
Headed Girl.” Likewise, the same dis-
maying penetration of the secrets of
family relationships is present in the
early and later work. Her faults in the
early books are not of style but of selec-
tivity; so much crowds in on her and
her heroines that the reader is almost
stifled by “this fumy den of the world,”
to use one of her own phrases. But a
fault of richness is always to be par-
doned in this lean country.
Richness is certainly the word for
Peter Mathers’ “Trap.” Time and des-
tiny, blood and character are all stirred
in together so that the part-Aboriginal
hero, Trap, with his ambiguous name,
descended from English, Irish, and
Tierra del Fuegan for good measure,
manages to represent almost every as-
pect of Australian misfortune. His an-
cestry and his history are equally disas-
trous, and his future looks positively
criminal. Mathers is a four-letter
satirist of the bourgeois society which
would like to pretend that Trap is
dangerous simply because he exists, but
the richness, almost indigestible at times,
is of episode and style. The originality
of his technique is brilliant, his grasp
of it not so sure. “Trap” is sometimes
difficult to fbllow, but it is an impres-
sive first novel.
Bruce Beaver, who is getting to be
one of our most interesting poets, has
written a harsh and often effective first
novel, “You Can’t Come Back,” which
shows that the Trap country can be
just as grim when the inhabitants are
white. Another first novel, “Surfie,” by
Roger Carr, deserved a lot better than
to appear in the format of pulp fiction.
The idiom, the soft-centre toughness of
the adolescent, and the real fire and joy
of surfing and driving too fast are all
caught very well indeed.
Hal Porter is the most brilliantly
polished of all our writers who reflect
rather than create life. The latest in-
stalment of his autobiography, “The
Paper Chase,” has some wonderful set
scenes, but Porter himself, as autobiog-
rapher, remains a shuffler of the cards
of identity even though we know what
brand of shaving brush he uses. It is
like having a drink in a bar with a man
who keeps his back to you.
Three important books on Australian
life and character appeared in 1966.
The smoothest was “The Australians,”
with George Johnston’s text accom-
panying Robert Goodman’s superb
photographs, a highly professional work
that deserved its success. Craig
McGregor’s “Profile of Australia” is a
mine of not-always-reliable information,
held together by a liberal common sense,
a tough respect for the intellect, and an
ability to enjoy the good things our
climate lets us have r But the most en-
dearing of the year’s books on Aus-
tralia, which one can return to again
and again, is Sidney Baker’s revised
and much enlarged edition of “The
Australian Language.” If any foreigner
wants to know what makes Australians
distinctively Australian, then give him
this book.
And now one rushes to the bookshelf
and starts apologising to A. G. L. Shaw
and “Convicts and the Colonies,” to
Elizabeth Harrower and her fine novel
“The Watch Tower,” to Judah
and “Season of Youth,” to John Iggul-
den, with a novel of his own and a
lively anthology of stories.
A running war
A running war is like a running wound,
A running wound is an unthrobbing ache:
The country lies about you without sound;
Neglect is death, and probing a mistake.
Nothing can buckle down such savage play:
Their networks of intelligence concealed,
Enemies group and strike and fade away,
Leaving you poor possession of a field
Without communication or reserves;
Fought out on battle-fields you do not choose,
A running war becomes a war of nerves
In which your losses are the only news.
The victor makes an orderly retreat —
You fall back on the city for assurance,
To hear your praises ring from street to street:
There, in displays of prowess and endurance,
Small squadrons of your uniform parade,
Clapping their heels, across a public square —
All with the lucid order that has made
Almost an empire, almost; but elsewhere,
Those ragged volunteers that shift like mist
Across the broken ground of shifting war
Diced for their first disorders to enlist,
And fight to have less than they had before.
Rich in imbalance, your temptation grows
To change with the marauders on the hill:
To break their city to a waste of prose;
To ride without direetion, and to kill.

THE RAIN AND THE RAFFERTYS
SHORT STORY BY JANICE KENNY
I DON’T know. It’s funny. I’m in
charge of the typing-pool at work
and sometimes I can just tell what
those young girls who work for me are
thinking when they look at me. The
quiet type of girl, I mean. Not the gay
ones. They never worry about anything.
But the quieter type of girl thinks:
Will she end up like me? I heard one
of them say that every time she gets
in a tram she looks at all the women’s
hands to see if they’re wearing rings.
She went red when she’d said* it. Poor
kid. She’s engaged now, so that’s all
right, I hope.
Yes, I can see them wondering about
me and how I am. There’s plenty of
time to' think in the tram twice a day,
five days a we§k. I do a bit of thinking
myself. Soon I’ll be practically middle-
aged. I was never what you’d call good
looking. Mum and I live at home in
Stephens Street. We’ve lived there thirty
years. Dad is dead and my brother, Jim,
is married in Sydney with three chil-
dren. Mum and I are knitting a jumper
for Jim’s eldest boy. I have to go care-
fully with the knitting because Mum
knits tighter than I do and we want
to keep the tension the same. Mum is
sixty-six. She is marvellous for her age.
Often she hears things quicker than I
do. The other night when we were knit-
ting she said: i
“What’s that? It sounds like the
Raffertys.” Then I could hear it, too,
the sound of laughing. The Raffertys
were always laughing. They were a
mad family.
“Can’t be,” I said. “The house is
empty.” But when I went to the window
I saw that the lights were on next door.
I caught a glimpse of someone with red
hair in the kitchen. Norah Rafferty!
For a minute there I felt like crying.
It was queer to hear the Raffertys
laughing again.
]J{UM went on knitting. “It’s the
girls,” she said. “Come back to
clear out the house. You know they’ve
sold it at last.” As a matter of fact, I
didn’t know. Mum knew all along. She
doesn’t tell me things sometimes. It’s her
way of being independent and pretend-
ing I’m still a child. People are like
that as they get older.
“Do you know who’s bought the
house?” I asked.
“People called Benson,” Mum said.
“They look nice, quiet people. I hope
we’re getting decent neighbors for a
change.” Her arm jerked as she said
this. She dropped a stitch. Mum never
liked the -Raffertys much. Since the
time Mr, Rafferty died last year she
can hardly bear to speak to them. It
was how they behaved. I’ve tried to
tell her it’s just their way and that
she doesn’t understand them. Even
now, the other night, I spoke up for
them.
“The Raffertys have had a lot of
trouble,” I said. She put down her
knitting.
“The trouble is they’ve got no sense.
Just listen to them. I’ll never forget.
that time . . .”
When Mr. Rafferty died we went
to the funeral. I took time off from
work and 1 know it was a real mark
of respect from Mum. She’s old-
fashioned and a bit prejudiced about
going into a Catholic church. Anyway,
she always said Mr. Rafferty was a
gentleman, although she couldn’t stand
the way he let the garden go so. It
spoilt the look of the street. Once
there was so much paspalum in their
yard she told me she was going to
complain to the Council. She didn’t,
though. She didn’t say anything to
Mr. Rafferty, either, and she’s got
quite a sharp way of saying things
when she wants to. I think she was
a bit sorry for him as well as respect-
ing him.
Well, we were in the church, wait-
ing for the chief mourners. There were
quite a few people there relatives
and men from Mr. Rafferty’s depart-
ment. He’d died suddenly with heart
trouble. When the Rafferty girls came
in, you should have seen the way they
were dressed. Norah, the eldest, has
got hair like a bushfire. She was wear-
ing a bright green suit with a hat all
feathers to match.
Claire, the second one, wore pale
blue. She was always the mother’s
favorite, tall and blonde, and lovely
looking a very ladylike kind of
a girl who seemed to live in a dream.
The night she made her debut and
we went over to see her in her
dress, Mrs. Rafferty couldn’t stop smil-
ing and fussing around. It was as if
the mother was going to the ball,
really. And when Claire got married
to a dentist, a man much older than
she was, Mrs. Rafferty was so proud
she could hardly talk about it. Un-
fortunately, it didn’t turn out well.
Claire had a nervous breakdown. For
a while she came back home to live
when she wasn’t in hospital having
treatment. The marriage broke up. It
was terrible for Mrs. Rafferty. You
could see.
Deirdre, the youngest Rafferty girl,,
is the clever one. She’s dark-haired
and she had on a lipstick-pink dress at
the funeral. Mum said the three of
them were like a bunch of parrots. I
wasn’t really surprised. It wouldn’t be
like the Raffertys to look dull, and I’m
sure Mr. Rafferty wouldn’t have wanted,
it, either. But Mum expects to see
things done properly. She was
shocked.
What really upset Mum was that
night. We were going quietly about
the house, conscious of the bereavement
next door, when the noise started. It
was the noise of a party. The Raffertys
and some of their relatives were there,
laughing and shouting. You could tell
there was'drink. For ten years we were
used to hearing the Raffertys laughing
and shouting and crying at one an-
other, but that night you might have
thought they’d be quiet, with the sad-
ness. I have never heard them so
noisy. If it had been any ordinary
party,. Mum said, she would have rung
the police.
JT went on till two o’clock in the
morning. Mum just never forgave the
Raffertys. Of course, there were all
the other things as well: The way they
were always dressed up and stuck up,,
and the affected way they talked. Mum
used to say that Mrs. Rafferty acted
as if her girls were something well
out of the ordinary. It’s not as though,
they had any money. And when you
think of the way poor Claire turned
out; she gets jobs here and there,
but she has to go and have treatment
for her nerves from time to time. Mrs.
Rafferty’s nerves went, too, after the-
funeral. I believe she is having treat-
ment.
Since then they have all moved away.
The house was put up for sale. Norah,
the eldest, has been married for some-
years and has a couple of children.
Mrs. Rafferty was opposed to Norah’s-
getting married. He wasn’t good
enough, the mother thought. Nothing-
w&s quite good enough for Mrs. Raf-
ferty’s girls.
It was Norah and Deirdre who came-
the other night to clear out the house.
They stayed a couple of days. Terribly
sad, I thought, tearing up your family
home like that. Of course, they laughed
and joked about it in the same old
•fashion. They came over to see us-
When Mum asked, “Is your mother
keeping well?” they looked at each
other and Norah said, “Mummy’s much
better, thank you.” Although, knowing


Mrs. Rafferty, I doubt if she’ll ever get
over the grief these past few years.
It annoys Mum the way they pre-
tend all the time. They even pretended
there wasn’t a death in the family. I
suppose some people can’t face reality.
Maybe they have the idea that it’s an
awful thing: reality, with people dying.
Maybe I don’t see it as they do.
So the way I am isn’t too bad. The
minister at our church says nobody’s
life is ever wasted; that God has a
plan for each of us. I’ve tried to see
His plan for me. Now, though, some-
how, because I’ve known the Raffertys,
like a bunch of bush parrots flying into
the electric wires, and those girls at
work with their engagement rings, and
the ones without them, I don’t worry
about it any more. It’s as if we’re all
in it together, all the same. To say
that life is wasted is like saying rain-
water is wasted. It depends on what
you mean. When you think about the
rain you realise that some of it soaks
into the ground and some of it evapor-
ates in the air and the rest just flows
into the sea.

LETTERS
Vietnam Survey
Sir,
In their reply to Professor Joyce
Ackroyd’s letter on the “Academic
Opinion Survey,” Gavin Sinclair and
Alex Carey say that a draft of the
clauses representing the pro-Vietnam
war position was sent to a professor of
political science ofi pro-Government
sentiment to suggest modifications. I
was, I take it, the person in question
and, as they say, all but one of my
suggested modifications were incor-
porated. What they fail to mention
is that, after making my suggestions, I
added that in my view the whole thing
was quite spurious considered as a
“survey” and that the statements read
like mere political manifestoes. I re-
ceived an acrimonious letter in reply
from Alex Carey.
I have since heard a great many
colleagues at our University express the
same view and -this helps to explain
why at least some people threw it into
the wastepaper basket. I signed the
pro-Government manifesto merely to
record a vote and not because I thought
the production could be taken seriously
as a survey of opinion.

Milk for India
Sir,
Some of us living in this vast land
of ours healthy, prosperous, and with
plenty of breathing space feel that
over and above anything we may al-
ready be doing, we must act now and
quickly alleviate at least one small part
of the suffering and want in India. A
number of distinguished citizens of
Melbourne have agreed to be sponsors
to an appeal for the purchase of bulk
packed powdered milk, which will be
offered to the Central Government of
India, thus ensuring distribution to the
near-starving people of Bihar and Uttar
Pradesh.
It costs $2BO to buy in bulk 1 ton of
skimmed milk; $560 1 ton of full
cream powdered milk. From 1 ton
comes approximately 16,000 pints of
milk. Donations for the purchase of
this milk may be sent to “Milk for
India” (Emergency Fund), Box 430 C,
G.P.0., Melbourne, or processed, pow-
dered, evaporated, or condensed milk
may be despatched from your nearest
railway station, labelled “Milk for
India” (Emergency Fund), c/o Caul-
field Railway Station, Victoria. Rail
freight is free within Victoria.

Miss Australia Contest
Sir,
I want to express my agreement with
the unnamed author ■of “Sweet
Charity” (8., Dec. 10) in his assess-
ment of the Miss Australia Contest.
I, and surely most other Spastics,
would heartily agree with the state-
ment that “for the organisation’s
helpers, many of them parents of
children with disabling and disfiguring
cerebral palsy, the emphasis of the quest
on physical perfection must seem
slightly off key.” This is putting it
mildly!
In no other organisation is the image
so completely divorced from its purpose
as in this case. Surely, if there is to be
any image at all, it should reflect the
work of the Spastic Centre and the-
aspirations of those in its care.
Lets face it; the average man in the-
street is woefully ignorant where the'
Spastic is concerned. More often than
not the Spastic is confused with the
mentally handicapped, or polio victim.
With its present emphasis on glamor,
the organisation is doing nothing to
correct this.
If at present commercial enterprises
are financing these gala events for
publicity purposes, would they not get
greater and more lasting publicity by
donating buildings, research grants, and
bursaries for the higher education of
Spastics?

Dossier on ASIO
Sir,
The recent survey of ASIO func-
tions by Sam Lipski (8., Dec. 10)
merits some comment by myself, mind-
ful of my recent remarks during the
estimates debate. The Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party has never ques-
tioned the need for ASIO. What we do
object to, however, are numerous ex-
amples ,• of ideological bias in the
evaluation of specific issues.
If the Commonwealth Government
would give a breakdown of the ideo-
logical background of the 150 migrants
rejected for political reasons, we might
be more reassured or perhaps our worst
fears would be confirmed.
As in Britain, under Herbert Morri-
son, British Home Secretary, so in Aus-
tralia under Dr. Evatt, Commonwealth
Attorney-General, subversion from
either extreme was subject to the same
process of law, but in recent years
there are no visible signs that this
principle is being adhered to.
Obviously, at least a small Parlia-
mentary Committee of the Leaders and
Deputy Leaders of Government and
Opposition parties would be a start
to correct this political imbalance.
Even the United States ensures that
its Senate Armed Services Committee
confers with CIA to observe the latter’s
administration trends.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Drab Year
IT could have been worse. There was not much to cheer
about in 1966 (except the end of the drought), but at
least we got through what could have been a very diffi-
cult year relatively unscathed. True, there were some angry
company directors and disappointed shareholders who felt
tha<t the authorities were not moving things along at a fast
enough clip, that the men in Canberra had badly miscalcu-
lated the speed with which the recovery in rural incomes
when the drought ended would spread through the economy,
and that the Government made a dreadful blunder in creating
a situation where the States felt-the need to raise extra
revenue in such cost-raising ways as higher State taxes and
transport charges.
But, for a year in which rural incomes and exports suffered
so severely in the drought, when private spending had to
give way -to a huge rise in the cash spent on defence, when
the U.K. and U.S. Governments did their damnedest to
stop capital exports to Australia, when shortages of inter-
national liquidity threatened a recession in world trading,
when Britain, our oldest and biggest customer, decided to
“squeeze” itself (and our exports) in an attempt to get out
of its balance of payments problems, when Wall Street
slumped on inflation-recession fears, when company profits
and the stockmarket both put in unimpressive performances,
when the lag in consumer spending meant mounting excess
capacity and widespread sackings in industries like the motor
trade and the appliance business, and when employment
figures were at least open to question, then given all that,
we got through 1966 pretty well.
Of course there were things on the credit side: export
commodity prices remained reasonably high (except for wool
and sugar); income was high, despite the drought’s impact
on rural exports, due to good results in minerals and metals,,
as there were major developments in the exploitation of
Australia’s natural resources, particularly iron ore, nickel,
oil, and gas; the slower rate of general economic advance
made it a little less difficult for these development projects
to be serviced with men and money from local sources and
also took the pressure off our imports bill when exports were
down; prices and costs remained relatively stable until toward
the end of the year; and the rate of capital inflow held up
remarkably well in the circumstances. But was it just good
luck that we got through 1966 relatively unscathed, or was
it the remarkable skill of the Government’s economic policies
that did the trick? There is a case to be made out, as J. C.
Horsfall does on page 8 and Croesus does on page 34, that
Mr. McMahon and his Treasury men have done rather well.
But there are also serious reservations about this.
There are those who feel it absurd that the Government
is content to let the economy run along so far below its full
capacity, and that it is vital to revitalise business and per-
sonal confidence. There is no doubt that the hesitancy in con-
sumption expenditure at a time when the economy is so
highly liquid stems from an unwillingness of consumers to
get into debt; that available cash resources are large but not
large enough to pay for desirable purchases completely ia
cash. This lack of confidence and, therefore, lack of spending
means that the Government’s tax revenues are falling. It is
replacing these by public borrowings that take the
savings in heavily over-subscribed Commonwealth loans.
Substituting borrowings for taxes is a silly way to run a.
country.
MEN AND MATTERS
IT was a year of resignation in all
senses. Departures from the top
jobs in the Treasury, in Australia’s
largest company, in its biggest life office,
in its biggest bank, in its only overseas
and one internal airline and in its
major stock exchanges made 1966 a
year of considerable change.
The tone for a year was set when
Sir Robert Menzies stood down after be-
ing Prime Minister for as long as half
the Australian electorate had been vot-
ing. Apart from the shuffling that took
place in Cabinet on Sir Robert’s de-
parture to bring Mr. McMahon into the
Treasurer’s seat, 1966 also saw the end
of Sir Roland Wilson’s long spell as the
man who signed the banknotes and his
translation into other fields of endeavor.
This was a pattern followed by Sir
Frederick Scherger, who went from
Chief of the General Staff to TAA and
Plessey. And to give the circle a little
rounding, a former Treasury official,
Don Hibberd, now with Comalco, was
appointed to the Reserve Bank board.
In big business, the major moves were
led by Mr. Norman Jones’ decision to
retire as managing director of BHP, so
that Sir lan McLennan will move up
one and Sir Colin Syme will leave his
legal practice to become a full-time
executive chairman.
At another of Australia’s biggest com-
panies, Burns Philp, Australia’s oldest
general manager, Mr. Joseph Mitchell,
and one of its
oldest directors,
Mr. F. E. Loxton,
both decided to
retire; at a com-
pany manufactur-
ing new fangled
motor cars (and
German ones at
that), two Aus-
tralian top men,
A. V. Gray and
W. J. Sullivan,
were replaced by
Volkswagen men
from overseas, so that the new man-
agement team has a greater imported
content than its products. Mr. lan
Jacoby retired from the board of his
third hire purchase company; Mr. Stan-
ley Korman (now appealing against a
gaol sentence on a false prospectus
charge) left the boardroom at Factors.
H G. PALMER swopped his chair-
man’s seat for one in the dock,
having been committed for trial over the
last H. G. Palmer Consolidated Ltd.
prospectus, and Dr. Alf Pollard left the
MLG for the comparative quiet of Mac-
quarie University.
Among the many men at the top to
step aside were Messrs. Alastair Urqu-
hart and Alf Mellor, longtime and
highly esteemed chairman of the Syd-
ney and Melbourne Stock Exchanges,
to be replaced by K. J. Polkinghorne
Ian Jacoby
Joseph Mitchell
Sir Roland Wilson
and C. T. Looker. Mr. C. G. Crane,,
chairman of Australia’s biggest life
office, the AMP Society, also stepped
down, as did Sir Hudson Fysh from
Qantas, Sir Giles Chippendall from
TAA, and Sir Alexander Fitzgerald
from most of his company chairman-
ships.
Tragically, a large number of de-
partures from company boards came
suddenly with death. Among the many
who died in office was Sir Warren
McDonald, bluff former head of TAA,
top man at the Commonwealth Banking
Corporation, and chairman of Mc-
Donald Industries. Another was Mr.
A. N. Armstrong, the bank’s managing
director under Sir Warren, who had
become a director of many public com-
panies and who followed not long after
his former chairman.


THE YEAR BRIEFLY
For the economy: At the year’s end a chorus of
bankers, company chairmen, and economists warbles about
hesitancy and a slackening in the growth of gross national
product. A few economists can be heard maintaining that
relief, and the necessary stimuli to lagging consumer
spending, are in the “pipeline.” Of great significance,
November’s employment statistics displayed a rather
untoward rise in unemployed registrants.
The Treasurer, Mr! McMahon, had expected “the
general effect of the Budget to be expansionary”; this
hope has not been realised, or at least not speedily enough
for most , tastes. The latest (September quarter) GNP
figures show a 3.6 percent increase, largely representing
wage and salary increases.
By and large the detailed statistical picture seems far
from adverse . . . Wool proceeds are higher . . . The banks
are more liquid than in 1965; their lending remains high
. . . Retail sales are rising only slowly, as are also hire-
purchase outstandings . . . Output of ingot steel advances;
appliances and motor vehicles stay- unimpressive . . .
Company operating surpluses crept up in the September
quarter.
Externally, exports are moving very well; five months
of 1966-67 to November yielded a $45.3 million trading
deficit . . . Some concern centres upon a reduced level
of capital inflow.
For the markets: For industrials it has not been
a particularly inspiring year on Australian stock
exchanges and the all-ordinaries index is struggling to
approach its start-of-year level. However, no one can com-
plain about non-ferrous metals and, to a lesser extent,
oils. Only steel and engineering (influenced by BHP’s
new image) and “other finance” issues managed a signifi-
cant overall advance.
Rhodesia, sterling, and the economic squeeze have
plagued London most of the year, so dealings have been
very colorless . . . Wall Street touched its 1966 lows in
October; it is perpetually oscillating with Vietnam and
the unresolved possibility of tax increases.
For companies: Drought and its side effects
ramified through many company operations in the first
half of the year; naturally pastoralists were the first victims
. . . Widespread optimism, however, sprang from the
changing investment complexion of Australia’s “seventh
State” BHP: Esso-BHP’s Gippsland offshore leases
yielded gas from Marlin B 1 well, and oil and gas at two
levels from Marlin Al; the Victorian Gas and Fuel Cor-
poration contracted to buy the gas at three cents a therm
for the first five years.
Financiers made the most of tight money conditions.
The Bank of N.S.W. increased its share in AGC to 43
percent . . . Finance Corporation made its seventh issue
in eight years and lost on a loan to Kosciusko Chalet
. . . MLC lost caste through the Palmer debacle; it re-
valued its shareholding in the life company to neatly cover
the $8.3 million write-off on H. G. Palmer; six former
directors of H. G. Palmer were summonsed for alleged
breaches of the Crimes Act in a debenture prospectus and
were cleared.
Chasing suburban shoppers, Farmers and Coles went to
Westfield’s centre at Burwood (N.S.W.), Coles joined
Myer’s Northlands centre at Preston (Vic.), and David
Jones went to Lend Lease’s Bankstown Square . . .Resort-
ing once again to an issue with transferable rights, G. J.
Coles raised $14.8 million, including premium . . . First
National City Bank joined Waltons Credit Corporation
. . . The weaker retailers went to the wall: Marcus Clark

The Best of a Bad Job
By CROESUS
THE Federal Treasurer, Mr. Mc-
Mahon, made the best of a bad
job on the Australian economy
this year, when the climatic and military
pipers called tunes that at least in one
case sounded more pleasing at the end
than at the beginning. In the circum-
stances, well-known critics of Govern-
ment economic policies, felt constrained
to be reticent. Even the Federal elec-
tions failed to evoke spirited criticism
of the Government’s fiscal policies and
if anybody got a rap for leaving the
economy in a rut it was the Governor
of the Reserve Bank for failing to
reduce interest rates. But it was a year
when matters of security transcended
economic.
Anyway, the critics of “stop and go”
have had nothing very much to aggra-
vate them these last three years or so.
Even with the economy presently run-
ning well below full capacity (probably
a lot far under it than seems fitting to
what is supposed to be a rapidly devel-
oping country), practically everybody
is prepared to take the Treasurer’s word
for it that an acceleration of activity
will come in good time, in fact is al-
ready on the way.
Now at the year’s end, and with sur-
plus resources to deploy, it is approp-
riate and also reasonable to predict
that, after an indifferent performance
in the last year, business will buck up
in 1967. I am not just taking Mr.
McMahon’s word for it, nor am I
going on my own intuitive feelings. The
justification for being mildly optimistic
is that consumer demand seems to have
picked up these last few months. The
main question is whether there will be
a strong follow through to the improve-
ment thus far, without any of the top-
ping-up people have been wishing on
the Treasurer to no avail.
; A FURTHER question is whether the
rise in consumer demand will prove
of sufficient strength and duration to
revive investment expectations which
have been flagging for some time, par-
ticularly in manufacturing industry and
farming. At all events, for a time we
could continue to have consumer spend-
ing and investment spending pulling in
opposite directions. This would make
any exercise of containment of an up-
surge in spending the easier, but it
would also mean that to keep the
impetus behind the business improve-
ment going we would have to be assured
of further injection of spending power,
say by tax reductions or increased
Federal deficits, which wouldn’t be
healthy at all. We don’t want a sort of
nine days’ wonder improvement in busi-
ness based on pump priming, but one
geared realistically to the most economic
opportunities for expanding fixed in-
vestment in the development of natural
resources.
For the essentially practical purposes
of facilitating labor absorption and
securing the jobs prospect generally in
1967, it is salutary that there’s a re-
vival in consumption in progress.
Against a background of under-
employed resources, a reasonably strong
balance of payments position, a low
level of stocks, and a high state of
liquidity in the banking system there
are strong grounds for believing it will
go a good deal further and so relieve
business anxieties of the sort outlined
by the Australian Industries Develop-
ment Association in its end-of-the-year
report. AIDA is not all that confident
it will happen, because it sees a singular
weakness in business confidence and
thinks that Dr. Coombs should be mov-
ing along rather more positive lines
in reducing official interest rates than
lie’s been travelling lately.
AIDA is really saying is that,
unless confidence is restored and
interest rates reduced, it is doubtful
whether a rise in business activity based
largely on an increase in consumer
demand will filter through to the invest-
ment area making decisions to put in
more plant. In any case these two factors
in themselves may not be decisive. For
one thing, in many industrial fields con-
siderable over-capacity exists, so that for
a great number of products demand
would have to increase very substan-
tially before firms in these industries
would consider adding to capacity.
Those who argue that if it gets
things moving faster it doesn’t matter
where a revival in consumer demand
springs from rely on a rather superficial
view of the process involved, that
ultimately everything will be brought
into line. You start, say, by whipping
up Government spending. This ex-
penditure in part becomes disposable
income of consumers who buy goods
from the shops. The shops in turn re-
plenish their stocks in the trade, from
which new orders flow back to the
manufacturers. The manufacturers
then buy more raw materials and com-
ponents and ultimately step up their
investment in new plant and equip--
ment whose production gives rise to
further increases in incomes, spending,
and so on. In this simplified frame-
work, the sequences flowing from an
injection of new spending power would
seem nicely clear-cut and the outlook
in terms of economic buoyancy and
employment predictable.
In 1967 the critical stage along the
road from consumer spending to the
ultimate decisions to spend more on
fixed investment —surely this and not
consumption or GNP is the true measure
of growth—will be right at the end. It
would certainly surprise me to see an
early reversal of the downward trend
in private fixed investment. Indeed,
from what I hear, there could be some
easing of the flow of capital into fixed
mining investment in 1967. In that
case it would be up to rural and manu-
facturing industries to bridge the gap.
Farmers could well make a bigger con-
tribution than last year, although they
are notoriously conservative in invest-
ment after poor seasons. As for manu-
facturing, the revival in consumption
would have to proceed a good deal
further than it has thus far to have
much effect at all next year.
Probably Mr. McMahon will look to
Government investment rather than
private channels to fill the investment
gap next year, but in any case he is
unlikely to be in a hurry to force the
pace at all. This is probably right,
because, given a bit more encourage-
ment from monetary policy, private
trade and industry can be expected to
make a hearty response to any increase
in the flow of orders back from the
shops to prepare the way for another
eventual lunge into fixed investment.
It will be time enough to start building
another layer of industrial capacity
when the last one looks more assured
of being brought into full use and the
satisfaction of a new permanent layer
of demand through population move-
ments demands it. We have enough
distortions in the industrial structure as
it is to build in more at the moment for
the sake of bolstering the national total
of fixed private investment.
Uranium to Boom?
URANIUM should be more and
more in the news over the next
12 months. It is definitely a con-
tender for the title of “boom metal” of
some year in the early ’7os. In the past
year, nuclear power sources have
reached the stage where they now com-
pete successfully with coal, even in
coal-producing regions. Prospecting is
starting up again, not only in Canada
and the U.S. but in Australia and other
hitherto minor producing areas.
One of Canada’s two main mines is
planning a $7.5 million expansion, and
the U.K. Government has placed its
first long-term order for uranium oxide
for power generation since the 1950 s
boom ended. In the U.S. for the first
six months of this year orders were
placed for nuclear power plant with
total capacity of 12,500 megawatts.
Of all large steam plant ordered
this year, 62.4 percent in capacity has
gone to nuclear units. Since the half
year, orders for a further 12,000-plus
mw capacity have been placed. The
demand for nuclear plants is build-
ing up considerably more rapidly than
expected.
So little information is available
about actual, as opposed to published,
reserves of the mineral, however, that
market performance is not easy to
predict. Because of the sudden drop
in demand last decade, mini reserves
have in many cases not been fully
proved, _ and the renewed exploration
effort will also change the picture.
However, if demand picks up as
quickly as expected and producers can
keep a reasonably united front, prices
seem bound to rise to at least SU.S.IO
a lb. in a few years.

PLATE No. 6: "The Harvesters"/Pieter Brueghel the Elder. (Holland)
Pieter Brueghel the Elder was born near Breda in 1525. He trained in Antwerp under
Coecke van Aelst and was appointed Guild Master in 1 551. □ Surprisingly, he did not go on
to work independently, but was employed by Hieronymus Cock, a copper etcher who dealt
in and issued works of art. □ During this period, Brueghel travelled widely, etching copies of
pictures in Holland and Italy for Cock. □ Brueghel's major works are those depicting peasants
and landscapes. It was in these paintings that he broke new ground, with a minimum of
subtlety in drawing, the simplest possible handling of surfaces, and a most unobtrusive
organisation of colour. □ In 1565, he conceived the idea of painting a series of pictures
depicting the different months of the year. "The Harvesters" is one of this series. Some of
the most breath taking pictures of this series are those that depict the winter months.
Brueghel is justly famous for snow scenes, and the delicate way in which he employed pure
white. □ He died in Brussels in 1569.

MAN ON THE LAND
Funny Things "Down Under"
ALL through the early and middle
part of 1966 we were told, by the
International Wool Secretariat, of
the dramatic “swing-back” to wool in
the United States. We were told, too,
that this was brought about by the
international Woolmark symbol and
other clever promotions paid for
(largely) by the Australian woolgrower
and the Australian taxpayer.
At the time we suggested that the
increased wool consumption in the U.S.
was actually at the expense of the Aus-
tralian woolgrower and to the advantage
of South American growers, who have
never contributed funds to the IWS
and who, predictably, refrain from
doing so. Our suggestion has now been
vindicated by a spokesman for the U.S.
Embassy in Canberra, Mr. C. de Goede,
who has been reported as saying that
through 1966. U.S. purchases of wool
from Argentina increased by 40 per-
cent. During the same period U.S. pur-
chases from Australia dropped by four
percent.
We would be inclined to trumpet this
loud and clear except that statistics can
be to science what a lamp-post is to
a drunk more a means of support
than a source of light. We have great
respect for the ability of the IWS and
Wool Board statisticians. They will be
working overtime to produce figures
which will persuade woolgrowers that
the Woolmark is a great thing for wool.
kinds of possibilities are open to
them. They can split the purchases
and shipments, they can talk of carry-
overs in the pipeline and all that sort of
thing, and generally confuse the issue at
will. It is true, for instance, that in the
same period U.S. purchases from New
Zealand increased by 26 percent and
this will be a useful prop, provided it is
not explained that New Zealand wool
is largely carpet wool and has nothing
to do with apparel wool at all. Aus-
tralian woolgrowers are at complete
liberty to decide for themselves whether
the Woolmark campaign is putting
money in their pockets or taking it out.
A 40 percent increase by Argentina
alone, not counting increases by the
other South American woolgrowing
countries, is, we suggest, rather signifi-
cant. Australian wool exports to the
U.S. for the September quarter of 1966
dropped 54 percent, by weight, com-
pared with the same period in 1965.
The value fell from $14.4 million to
$7.7 million. That is rather significant,
too, and we will look forward with
anticipation to the explanations to come
from the IWS.
The drought, naturally, will be
brought in and could be valid up to a
point. But only just. Inefficiencies in
the Australian wool marketing system?
Here is a real possibility. Much will be
made of this, we feel. Many things will
be trotted out as reasons for ineffici-
encies in the marketing system and they
will all carefully ignore the point that
wool in South America is cheaper to
buy and the market is free.
Woolgrowers in Australia must soon
ask themselves just what all the sub-
sidies, supports, plans, restrictive de-
vices, and levies achieve. They achieve
something all right.
This can be seen in the Wool Board’s
annual report. We refer to the funds
allocated by the Wool Board to the
CSIRO, State Departments of Agri-
culture, other State bodies, and the
universities. Wool, under the guidance
of the Wool Board, has become a factor
in the public sector. Woolgrowers, by
and large, would never have even con-
sidered this but it is the achievement.
It is far too late for any farmer to
talk of the Wool Board being dis-
banded. The time for that was when
the levy was 5 cents a bale instead of
around $3. There are too many jobs
involved now.
The CSIRO was, naturally, the big
beneficiary. Animal physiology got
$1,204,000; plant industry, $734,804;
animal genetics, $329,600; animal
health, $260,300; nutritional bio-
chemistry, $190,302; wildlife research,
$177,800; and entomology, $54,400.
The Victorian Department of Agri-
culture got $128,426; the N.S.W. De-
partment $93,738; South Australian
Department, $83,590; Queensland De-
partment, $68,882; W.A. Department,
$41,158; Tasmanian Department,
$39,958, etc.
Sydney University got $94,300; New
England, $81,000; Adelaide, $77,000;
West Australia, $67,000; Melbourne,
$42,000; Queensland, $41,000; N.S.W.,
$19,000; Monash, $10,000; ANU,
$6000; Gordon Institute, $l3OO.
Let it be said, of course, that some
of these projects could have returned
more than the outlay in terms of dis-
coveries and some will one day, per-
haps. There’s always the chance of yet
another breakthrough, big break-
through, or even a major breakthrough.
It was a mistake, really, to call the
wool symbol the Woolmark. They
should have called it the breakthrough
symbol.
has all this got to do with
tackling the real problem confront-
ing the Australian wool industry and all
other primary industries—the cost-
price spiral? High tariffs are not, we
suggest, the only contributory cause.
The proliferation of Government, semi-
government, and public instrumentali-
ties at Federal, State, and municipal
level are a burden which Australia
cannot afford. We must be the most
over-governed country on earth. The
essential public services suffer while
ever more grandiose plans are dreamed
up in the high towers of the public
sector paladins.
Emboldened a little by our foresight
over U.S. wool purchases in South
America, we are prepared to wager that
some form of acquisition plan will be
unwrapped, for a showing at least,
through 1967. All the old arguments
will be used and the statistics will be
produced to support the contention.
South Africa and New Zealand will
lend support. Why wouldn’t they?
Australia will carry the bulk of the
burden. The South American countries-
will do nothing (except extend hos-
pitality to visiting IWS delegations)
and will happily go on growing more
wool and selling it at a profit.
The latest Wool Board promotion
gimmick, we are told, is a film to
be called “Funny Things Happen
Down Under.” An appropriate title,
indeed.
Attack on Merino Breeding
TRADITIONAL merino breeding
from stud rams comes under
strong attack in the latest issue
of “Farm Policy,” authoritative journal
of the University of Western Australia’s
John Thomson Agricultural Economics
Centre. A leading Doodlakine flock-
owner, Mr. Peter Walsh, claims that
“for far too long breeding progress has
been stultified by a system which evalu-
ated animal characteristics in inverse
ratio to their economic importance.”
And he outlines a scheme which, he
says, can bring assured genetic increase
in wool of up to two percent annually.
The main criterion of the scheme is
fleece weight, and Walsh claims this will
bring about improved flocks without
recourse to expensive stud rams, whose
“shock of transition from their hot-house
environment to the hard world of reality
temporarily impairs fertility,” as the
first of a number of drawbacks to their
use.
Mr. Walsh sees two main faults in
the traditional breeding approach:
“First, the practice of determining fleece-
weight by visual guess instead of scale
reading. This practice, though obviously
foolish, is probably less damaging than
the insistence of examining all the ex-
ternal features which the studmaster
believes or imagines to be associated
with production instead of measuring
production itself.” This attitude, he
says, produces such cliches as “the
horned ewe is a light cutter,” “the bare-
headed ram is a light cutter,” and culls
rams with “flaky” horns, “mean”
nostrils, and “weak” backs.
“The \vhole approach to merino
breeding is enveloped in an aura of
mystery and complexity unrelated to the
knowledge and skill required. This posi-
tion is sorely aggravated by the influence

PLATE IMo. 7: "Maidservant Pouring Milk"/Jan Vermeer. (Holland)
The genius of some painters is recognised only after their deaths. That of Vermeer, although
acknowledged in his own time, passed into oblivion for over two centuries. Only, one
hundred years ago, his works had to be ascribed to de Hooch to effect a sale. □ Vermeer's
work typifies his delightful sense of colour and balance. He was born in Delft, and nothing is
known of his boyhood and youth. The name of Rembrandt is suggested in connection with
his early studies, but more probably, Vermeer was a pupil of Bramer, a friend of the family.
Evidence suggests that Vermeer led a life of poverty. Although pictures sold readily in
Holland during his life, it is probable that public preference was for a less refined art than
that of Vermeer. □ Twice, Vermeer was elected for yearly terms of office as president of the
Guild. He died at the age of forty-three and was buried at Delft.

of breed societies, agricultural societies,
show judges, and professional classers
both inside and outside stock firms.”
The critic brands the jargon used by
these people as fatuous and nebulous —
“ ‘even toplines,’ ‘good underlines,’ ‘well-
set horns,’ ‘attractive faces,’ ‘a bold eye,’
‘a breedy muzzle.’ This mumbo-jumbo
and gobbledygook is about as relevant
to important factors in animal selection
as is the pattern of a goat’s entrails.
Instructions distributed by classers and
breed societies advise first an examina-
tion of a ram’s general appearance, its
feet, its head, its horns, its belly, and
so on. Somewhere near the end they
recommend an appraisal of the fleece,
which, of course, is guessed. In an
economic analysis the only factors of
real importance in a merino are the
value of the wool it can produce and
ability to regenerate.”
In his summing-up, Mr. Walsh claims
that a breakthrough in this field would
simply be a matter of applying common
sense. “If all Australian sheepmen
follow this path they will add at least
$lO million to the national wool
cheque. The increase will be cumula-
tive: $lO million this year, $21.1 million
next year, and so on. If the major
studs lead the way, it will be easier
for all. But the individual flock owner
can, if he chooses, go it alone.”

SOON, with harvests gathered and
the year’s work done, some farmers
may have time to relax a little and
maybe read a little. Books about agri-
culture written by Australians for Aus-
tralians are relatively rare. However,
several have appeared in the bookshops
during the past months, and this is a
highly desirable state of affairs. Almost
a dozen come readily to mind, covering
the Ord River project, weed control,
animal diseases, useful native plants,
agricultural education, and other diverse
subjects. It is to be hoped that they
will find enough readers to encourage
further the local publishers and poten-
tial authors to undertake the costs and
labors involved.
At this stage it would be churlish to
be too critical. Mostly agricultural
books are beset by the difficulty of com-
manding a large enough readership to
become a paying proposition. This
causes the publishers to claim that
nearly every book is intended for pretty
well everyone in the country, whereas
usually their authors are specialists who
have treated their subjects narrowly.
The resulting book really only interests
other specialists or neo-specialists in the
same field.
The publishers of both these parti-
cular books hope to find readers in New
Zealand and one of them even sallies
farther afield into the benighted regions
of Asia and elsewhere. After having
been the victims for so long of British
publishers who apparently'believed that
what was good for the English farmer
was also good for the Australian, it is
to be hoped, now that our turn has
come, we will not be so arch. For an
Australian to tell a New Zealander how
to raise fat lambs or an Egyptian how
to irrigate seems like telling one’s
grandmother how to suck eggs.
Because of their subjects alone, both
these books deserve to be bought by
enough locals to recompense the pub-
lishers, who shouldn’t then have to
chase sales beyond our shores. Every
Australian is a lamb-eater and a high
proportion of our landholders are in the
fat-lamb business. In this driest of con-
tinents even the inner-city flat dweller
has good reason to be interested in irri-
gation schemes. He has to help pay for
them. The lamb-eater who grumbles
at the price of his chops will read that
the producers’ return to capital, even in
the better - favored districts, is only
around three percent, and perhaps he
will begin to appreciate as he reads
on how this situation has come about.
Dr. Tribe is Professor of Animal Hus-
bandry at the University of Melbourne
and his fellow scribe, Mr. Coles, is a
successful Victorian prime-lamb raiser.
This unique partnership has indeed
compiled a book of real value to far-
mers —its primary audience. Even those
who are purely woolgrowers are likely
to pick up a few wrinkles about the
nature of the animal they are relying
upon for their livelihood. Management
of lambing to improve survival is no
less a problem, for instance, for the
woolman than for the fat-lamb man.
Mention of this particular aspect of
the broader subject of reproduction
prompts one query: the authors seem to
infer that clover disease always induces
permanent infertility in ewes grazing
clover-dominant pastures. There is
plenty of evidence, however, that in the
eastern States, particularly, such graz-
ing usually causes only a temporary
form of infertility. One might quibble
about several other technical points in
the book, but altogether they, hardly
amount to a serious reservation.
But while sounding the critical
trumpet: it seems a pity that the
authors decided not to furnish their
otherwise useful book with a selected
list of further reading. The State De-
partments of Agriculture have an in-
valuable literature on fat-lamb produc-
tion, which contains much more
detailed discussion of district difficulties
than a broadly aimed book can pro-
vide. Farmers, therefore, should not ac-
cept this book as an adequate substi-
tute for the information contained in
their State Department publications.
The book has twelve chapters, which
range from a discussion of the pattern
of the fat-lamb industry in Australia
to the design and construction of such
farm improvements as fences, creeps,
yards, and sheds. The book’s guts are
in the middle, where one might ex-
pect to find them. The central chap-
ters describe, in language that anyone
could enjoy reading, the biology of
breeding, pregnancy, lactation, growth
and carcass quality, and the practical
implications. Pasture management,
utilisation, and fodder conservation are
given three chapters.
The other book makes much tougher
reading, especially as it doesn’t have
an obvious bearing on one’s bank ac-
count. Nevertheless, it is a must for
visionaries, government planners, and
do-gooders. The inhabitants of the two
case study areas, namely the Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Settlement and the
Southern Murray-Darling Basin, can
learn a lot about their towns and dis-
tricts from reading it. People living in
or near areas slated to receive irriga-
tion will also be glad that they read
this book before the waters inundated
them.
'J'HIS book can lead all who study
it to realise that there is a heck of a
lot more to irrigation schemes than the
feasibility and cost of engineering
works and the ensuing opportunities
for increased crop and animal produc-
tion. Its main concern is with the
social and economic consequences. In
short, the book deals with contentious
considerations, but it will not provoke
nearly as much controversy as Dr.
Davidson’s “Northern Myth,” published
some months earlier.
Yet there is enough scandal to main-
tain most readers’ interest. How many
of us remember that the Water Con-
servation and Irrigation Commission of
New South Wales once ardently espou-
sed racial intolerance and was confirmed
in this un-Australian attitude by a
decision of the High Court? The Com-
mission refused to permit the transfer
of farms on the M.I.A. to Italians on
the grounds that these people, whose
Roman ancestors built some of the most
remarkable aquaducts the world has
ever known, would not be good irri-
gation farmers. Besides, the Commission
claimed, quite forgetting such object
lessons as the Barossa Valley, that it
wQuld not be a good thing to allow
a national group to aggregate. (Would
the Commission dare to project such a
posture today?) The authors point out
that the Italians have staved off the
collapse of the M.l.A.’s horticultural
industry, taken over hundreds of farms
damaged by Australian farmers, and
maintained and improved them.

versity of Sydney. Roderick Shaw has

most appealing dust-jacket.

By JASON
THERE’S no getting away from it:
1966 was not a good year for the
market. And 1967 promises to be
only moderately better. Apart from
BHP, which is still one of the best oil
speculations on the ’Change, and Con-
solidated Gold Fields, whose flotation
this month brought staggering rewards
for the stags, there was not much cheer
in 1966.
Of course some people made money
in the stockmarket, because there were
some handsome rises (and falls). But
overall the relative lack of movement
made it difficult to do well—particularly
for the brokers, some of whom are find-
ing things quite tough.
The only bright thing about the
stock exchanges in 1966 was the mining
market (along with sections of the oil
post). The non-ferrous metals section
of the Sydney share price index jumped
by 18 percent in 1966, so bringing a
huge 55 percent rise in the last three
years. There can be no doubt that the
rate of development of Australia’s min-
eral wealth has increased dramatically
in recent times, but there seems a real
danger that investors could be doing
to the mining market what they did to
the industrials market back in 1960.
Some of the projections of likely profit
from Consolidated Gold Fields, for ex-
ample, that are now being circulated by
brokers to their clients seem a bit far-
fetched; some of the reasons for pricing
up the shares in barriers like B. H.
South, at a time when lead zinc prices
seem sure to fall further have the ap-
pearance of being over-confident, even
though the reports of an arrangement
between the Collins House group of
companies in developing Western Min-
ing’s nickel finds could bring some in-
teresting and rewarding links.
But excluding the buoyant mining
section from the share list, things look
terrible. Over the past three years the
only other section of the market to have
moved at all forward was steel and
engineering—and that is probably due
mainly to the big weighting of oil-
fevered BHP.
rpHE 11 percent fall in the all-ordin-
aries index since 1963, despite a 55
percent jump in the mining index,
hides some significant sectional moves in
share prices which could give some idea
of likely recovery situations - or pos-
sible continuations of downtrends. For
it is not enough simply to look at the
latest year’s price moves. There are
some industry groups where prices
appear to be continuing steadily down.
Despite the “bargain” prices suggested
by the 30 percent fall in this section of
the index, it would be a brave man who
bought into the electrical appliance
business at present. It will take a long
time before the overcapacity here is
finally all used up.
And a three-year look suggests, for ex-
ample, that although there clearly is
scope for further improvement in in-
vestment in pastoral stocks, which are
still 8 percent below their 1963 level
despite the end-of-drought rise of 5.6
percent in 1966, there may be far
greater opportunities for eventual re-
covery in other more depressed sections
of the market. This is not to deny that
companies like Ralph McKay, the disc
maker for ploughs, or L. J. Hooker,,
the North Australian cattle company
(that runs a real estate operation as
well) should prove highly rewarding
investments over the next year or two.
But it is striking that the “other
finance” companies (the hire-purchase
group) are still 27 percent below their
1963 level despite the 3.7 percent rise
in 1966 (which followed some solid
buying recommendations in this group
on this page earlier in the year) and
which suggests the industry is on the
recovery road. There is still great scope
for recovery here as consumer spending
rises (as it must with the large increases
in young people coming into the “big
spending” age groups in coming years.)
So despite the incursions of the so many
big foreign-owned finance houses into
this business, companies like AGC and
lAC still look very appealing.
The 30 percent drop in the market
prices of companies in the trade and ser-
vices index shows a clear opportunity for
significant increase for investors when
the retail trade stops cutting its own
throat and consumer spending regains
the momentum it lost last year. Myers,
Grace Bros., and the chain stores Wool-
worths and Coles look good at today’s
prices.
QVERALL, the likely course of Aus-
tralian stockmarkets in 1967 is
neither as bad as the chartist Cassandras
suggest on the one hand and not as good
as the indefatigable bulls on the other,
who see a stockmarket leap forward as
the inevitable consequence of lower
short-term interest rates. But it does
seem reasonable to guess that the market
will not be as dull in 1967 as it was in
1966—if even it will be far from buoy-
ant.
For while so many factors suggest
that share prices should rise, the basic
point is that company results are un-
likely to provide any serious backing
to this move in the current year, and
that supply and demand influences on
the share market (particularly as the
current high level of liquidity dries up
when the Reserve Bank eventually and
inevitably ceases to take the view that
the economy needs kicking along with
a lot of cash) could limit the scope with
any rise. The fact remains that the out-
look is slightly better for share prices
now that the drought is over, now that
we know the worst (or do we?) from
Britain, and now that short-term interest
rates are edging downward. And for
some sectors of the market that had
been affected by specific things like the
drought, the coming year should show
some definite improvements.
How Share Prices Have Moved


MINING
The Prospects for Iron Ore
WHEN the promised flotation of
Hamersley Iron Pty. Ltd. takes
place next year the, Australian
public will have its first opportunity to
invest in a company whose business is
solely based on iron ore. Until six years
ago, when the Federal Government’s
embargo on the export of iron ore was
lifted, this would have been inconceiv-
able. So much has been written on the
contribution that iron ore will make to
Australian export earnings on the basis
of presently negotiated contracts, but
not many people have stopped to won-
der how long this can last and what
scope there is for further expansion of
Australian iron ore exports.
The Australian iron ore boom is by
no means unique. A tecent article in
a South African mining journal des-
cribe’s the world expansion in iron ore
mining in the past dozen years as being
scarcely less exciting than the post-war
uranium boom and Australia’s contri-
butions are yet to be felt. Since 1950
world iron ore production has increased
from 250 million tons to reach almost
600 million tons in 1965. At the same
time abundant world Reserves have been
established which should ensure ade-
quate supplies of high-grade ore alone
for some considerable time, without
taking into account the vast low-grade
reserves.
The rate of in production
is more remarkable when it is realised
that the new tonnages are mainly of
high-grade or beneficiated ore, so that,
in terms of contained iron units, the
rate of increase is even greater than
the tonnage figures indicate. The trend
to higher grade material is continuing.
World capacity for pellet production,
which was estimated at 40 millibn tons
at the beginning of 1965, is expected to
rise to 95 million tons by 1970 and 190
million tons by 1975, representing an
increasing proportion of production.
Recent forecasts of total iron ore con-
sumption by 1975 range between 720
and 780 million tons, or about three
times the 1950 level.
high-grade direct ship-
ping and beneficiated ores are the
most favored, export markets are be-
coming increasingly competitive. Price
levels have deteriorated in recent years
and further falls seem inevitable. World
water-borne trade in iron ore is esti-
mated to increase from 101 million
tons in 1962 to about 172 million tons
in 1970, with Western Europe, Japan,
and U.S.A. remaining the principal
markets. Increased trade in iron ore
has meant that suppliers from all con-
tinents are in competition for avail-
able markets and any producers and
consumers who do not provide facilities
for accommodating the larger and
more specialised ore carriers will suf-
fer an increasing disadvantage in the
future.
The growth in iron ore production
is, of course, dependent upon the
ability of the iron and steel industry
to absorb the increase in output. Over
the past decade the world, steel in-
dustry has been experiencing a period
of substantial surplus capacity. While
capacity increased by 87 percent to
525 million ingot tons in the period
1955 to 1965, demand rose by only
65 percent to 446 million ingot tons.
Unused or surplus capacity increased
from 4 percent to 15 percent of total
capacity over the same period. The
four major non-Communist steel-
making areas, the European Coal and
Steel Community, the United Kingdom,
the United States, and Japan have
accounted for the major part of the
world surplus, the relative falling-off
in demand being due mainly to the
failure of the overall economy to grow
at the predicted rate and a weakening
of the intensity of steel demand within
the overall economic growth.
RECENT study of the problem of
world surplus steel capacity con-
cludes that there is little likelihood of an
early improvement in the situation and
that substantial under-utilisation of
world steelmaking capacity is likely to
persist until at least into the middle of
the next decade, and probably until
close on 1980. However, it suggests that
there are grounds for supposing that
capacity requirements may be much
greater thereafter. The general level of
world per capita consumption is
extremely low in the face of almost
certain widespread growth in indus-
trialisation. Therefore, if the per capita
consumption of the highly industrialised
countries did no more than remain
constant, the potential demand by the
emergent countries would be almost
insatiable.
Any estimate of the long-term pros-
pects for Australian iron ore producers
must be based primarily on forecasts
of the requirements of the Japanese
iron and steel industry, which seems
likely to remain the major market for
Australian ore. Although small con-
tracts have recently been negotiated
with U.K. and European consumers, the
future requirements of these consumers
are expected to be met primarily from
Scandinavia, West Africa, Canada, and
the eastern parts of South America. If
Australia is to enter this highly com-
petitive market as a substantial supplier,
she will have to reduce transport costs
by the use of ore carriers of consider-
ably greater capacity, than the 65,000
ton vessels which are to be used for
the Japanese trade.
Pellets, rather than lump ore, seem
the most logical form in which iron ore
could be exported to these markets.
In contrast with the freight disadvantage
suffered in European markets, Aus-
tralian ports of shipment are 1000 miles
nearer to Japan than her nearest major
supplier, India (including Goa), ancL
between 7000 and 11,000 miles nearer
than the big South American suppliers,.
principally Chile and Peru.
Although Japan’s existing
are stepping up iron ore production,
Australia seems destined to become the-
major supplier by the early 19705, when,,
on the basis of presently known con-
tracts, Australian exports will reach
approximately 20 million tons per year.
Various forecasts have been made oF
Japanese iron ore requirements over
the next decade. Estimates for 1975
range from about 53 million tons
75 million tons, based on growth rates-
for Japanese steel production from be-
tween 4 and percent per annum.
On the same basis, requirements in-
-1980 could range between 65 and 115
million tons. On the basis of currently
planned Australian capacity of approxi-
mately 20 million tons, the balance oF
1975 requirements will be between 33
and 55 million tons, rising to 45 to
95 million tons in 1980. Clearly then,,
unless the growth rate in Japanese iron-
ore requirements is much above 4
percent ' and supplies from other
sources remain around 1965 levels of
36 million tons, there is little scope
for further Australian exports to Japan.
until the end of the 19705.
Japan is now emerging.from a periocL
of recession which began in late 1963.
Restrictions on steel production, which
would have held 1966 production about
steady at 1965 levels, have been lifted
and estimates of 1966 production have-
been revised at about 47 to 48 million
tons, an increase of between 14.5
and 17 percent over 1965. However,
it seems unlikely that the remarkable-
growth rate Japan has experienced over~
the past sixteen years will continue.
SHIGEO NAGANO, president of
Fuji Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., ex-
pects Japanese steel requirements to
increase, at the most, at a rate of be-
tween 7 and 8 percent per annum. One
area in which the Japanese steel industry
could be vulnerable is in its exports,
which now amount to nearly one
quarter of total production. U.S. mar-
kets accounted for some 4.35 million,
tons or 44 percent of exports in 1965
(35 percent in 1964), with Asian
countries taking the next largest
share. It seems likely that the war in-
Vietnam has been an important factor
in the increase in U.S. imports. Thus,.,
in the event of a sudden ending to
the Vietnamese war, Japanese exports
could be severely hit. However, a
new market to control exports to the
U.S. was set up last June, with the
aim of establishing an orderly export
system based on “a fair margin of
profit.” In the longer term, Japan must
be looking to Communist China as a
market for her steel exports. Any
significant move in this direction must
be of ultimate benefit to Japan’s iron
ore suppliers.


From the Charts in 1966
AFTER reading Speculator’s prompt
annual report, summary and
outlook, the Chartist felt inspired
to review 1966 on the charts and to
make comments where necessary on
the stocks mentioned during the past
year. The Chartist does not feel as
optimistic as Speculator, preferring to
ignore the present upswing and wait
for the market to make a more de-
cisive movement early in the New
Year. The present time is somewhat
critical for the Australian stock market
in relation to the position of the index
in its long-term trend, and the future
direction of the index should become
evident during the early months of
1967. Special situations arise from
time to time, but, in the event of any
sharp downside reversal, even those
stocks managing to “swim against the
tide” could find it difficult to main-
tain an upward trend. A great deal of
caution should therefore be exercised
at the present time.
Eight industry groups came under
technical review during 1966, com-
mencing with the tobacco stocks.
British Tobacco did rise to the pro-
jection of $2.40 (allowing for stock
split) and in fact achieved a high
point of $2.46. It is now in a “topping”
situation and investors would be un-
likely to expect any immediate further
capital gains from this stock. Rothmans
fell to a low of $2.38 and a downside
target of $2.40 had been given. There
is still no reason to buy and a major
decline could follow any fall in price
below $2.30. Philip Morris now ap-
pears to have “topped” at $7.60. Prices
have recently eased to $6.76 and the
stock has decisively broken a six-year
uptrend and should now be sold.
Nothing spectacular was recorded by
the paper stocks, which showed prom-
ise during the early part of 1966. Both
APM and Associated Pulp have
changed direction and appear headed
for downside objectives of $1.30 for
the former and between 95c and $l.OO
for the latter.
lf pHE container group has also been dis-
appointing for investors. Dodge Con-
solidated fell to the indicated level of
$1.60 and is still in a downtrend. J.
Fielding is moving sideways, but now
shows signs of breaking the down-
trend held since 1962. National Bag
has deteriorated technically and could
fall to approximately $l.OO. Reed Paper
has fallen to $1.45 and close to the
target of $1.40. Fibre Containers has
recently penetrated the downtrend held
since 1964 and would be quite safe to
hold above the $1.20 level.
The warning not to buy electrical
stocks has certainly been justified in
view of the subsequent performance of
some stocks in this group. A target of
$l.BB was given for AW A, which
actually fell to $1.87. Any further
penetration of this level would mean
a resumption of the downtrend. EMI
has not achieved the downside objective
of $1.50 but is still in a downtrend.
Electrical Equipment managed to rise
only fractionally at $2.70. Electronic
Industries “B” fell to the first target
of 70c and continued in a recessive
downtrend to a new low of 38c; there
is still no reason to buy. International
Resistance could still move down to 70c.
Caution was given if Pye Industries fell
below $1.20. The downtrend has con-
tinued for this stock and 89c was re-
corded recently.
There has certainly been no upswing
in the appliance group. Email has con-
tinued to show small fluctuations around
the 40c level. General Industries has
failed to break the strong resistance
level at $1.45 and it would be dangerous
to hold this stock should sales fall below
$1.20 in the short term. A. G. Healing
has been to a low of 16c, Kelvinator and
Malleys have moved only fractionally
and are still in downtrends. Simpson
Pope slumped to 20c. There is still no
technical reason for investors to buy
any of these stocks.
YJHE pastoral group are still reason-
ably sound. Dalgety appears to be
basing, Elder Smith is still in trend but
it would be unwise to hold this stock
should prices fall below $2.35. Pitt Son
& Badgery would still give no technical
reason to buy; Winchcombe Carson is
still in a base area and is unlikely to
have any substantial rise until the $l.OO
resistance level is broken. Younghusband
has moved up to its resistance level at
90c and, if this is penetrated, a move
to about $1.30 could eventuate.
Building materials still do not show
signs of any technical strength. BMI
has a downside target of $1.15. Brick-
works would become critical if sales fall
below $6.50 and targets of $5.80 and
$4.80 would be possible. Hunter Douglas
could fall to about $l.OO should the sup-
port level at $1.50 fail to hold. PGH
Industries is moving down toward its
objective of 95c. Pioneer Concrete could
still fall to $l.OO. Wormald Bros, fell to
98c last week and is not far from the
90-95 c projection.
Comments on the chemical group are
only recent and remain unaltered by
current market action.
Now for a brief appraisal of some
of the individual recommendations:
BHP rose quickly to the first target
of $6.50 and, in fact, went to $6.54. It
is once again showing above average
market strength after following the
normal reaction or pullback after the
break in downtrend, and the uptrend
could be resumed in the short term.
Targets of $7.40 and $B.OO lie ahead
with an even higher target of over
$lO.OO for the longer term. Deposit and
Investment went higher than the first
projection of 30c and rose to 35c before
reacting to 28c recently. The base pro-
jection of about 70c still applies, and
sales at 26c would “test” and confirm a
100 percent uptrendline in the coming
week.
AOG was disappointing and broke
the $2.10 support level. A warning of
the deteriorating position was issued
during October and the stock has al-
ready fallen to $1.74 with a target of
$1.50 still possibly for the short to
medium term. It has resumed the
major downtrend.
Swan Brewery rose to $2.75 after
the recommendation, but has since
deteriorated technically along with the
other brewery stocks. It would be un-
wise to hold this stock below $2.30.
Steamships Trading would haye to
break the resistance now formed at
$l.lO before any further rise, and once
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS could strike it rich with HILL 50 GOLD MINES N.L. The chart
on this stock, which has been reproduced back to 1961, shows a high point of
$l.ll in that year and an overall sideways movement until late 1962, when a
downtrend commenced and took prices to a low point of 14c in May, 1966. The
share price movements over the past two years have formed a head-and-shoulders
reversal pattern and the sharp rise to 30c during the past week on very high volume
has penetrated the downtrend. A short-term target of about 40c would be possible
and the base consolidation suggests a minimum probable move to about 65c for
the longer term. The target suggested could eventually be exceeded and the situation
would require reassessing at that point. Last sale price on 16/12/1966 —29 c.


again it should not be held if sales
fall below 90c.
AGC has performed well and has
already recorded a high of $1.62 and
is quite likely now to achieve the base
projection of $1.85.
Lifesavers could be safely held above
$2.50.
CSR could fall to $2.20 if the sup-
port level at $2.60 breaks. It has been
unable to break the resistance level at
$3.25. This stock will undoubtedly be
influenced by any general weakness in
the building and sugar stocks, which
appears likely. James Hardie has de-
teriorated technically and should not
now be held.
Petersville broke a promising up-
trend and a pessimistic target of about
42c is indicated.
AMI has risen to 54c, which is very
close to the short-term target of about
62c after allowing for a 5c dividend
adjustment. Although the base suggests
an eventual target of 80c, it would be
unwise to hold this stock in the event
of a price recession below 44c.
Steel Mills was unable to break the
resistance level at 82c and should not
be held at present on technical grounds.
ODE was another stock which also
failed to break a resistance level and
further consolidation is now likely be-
fore any important rise.
L. J. Hooker rose to 39 cents after
the recommendation and has since fol-
lowed the normal reaction by falling
to 30c. It is in a substantial base pat-
tern, but could continue to fluctuate
around the 30 cent level in the event of
any overall market weakness.
Marrickville Holdings was mentioned
at $l.lO and quickly fell to 95c. A
fall below this level could be followed
by a further decline to about 75c.
Wide fluctuations can be expected for
some time, as the stock is still well
within a major downtrend showing re-
cessive tendencies.
Whale Industries still appears sound,
but will have to break the 50c resist-
ance level. It is still basically in trend.
David Jones could still fall to $l.OO.
Comeng is difficult to assess at
present and sales below $l.OO would
be serious, but the base projection of
between $1.50 and $1.60 would still
be possible.
BH South is gaining market strength
and has a short-term objective of about
$3.60 with $4.80 for the longer term.
Western Mining could rise to about
$B.OO.
At $4.90 it would be a critical level
for Tooth and Co. and a fall below
here could be followed by a decline
to $4.00 eventually. This stock is now
basically out of its long-term uptrend
and therefore should not be held on
technical grounds. This would also
apply to Amalgamated Holdings.
In conclusion, the Chartist wishes
investors a prosperous New Year and
feels that toward the close of 1967
would well be the end of the down-
trend for most stocks in the industrial
sections.
SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Recovery by Grace Bros.
WHEN I originally decided to in-
clude Grace Bros. Holdings Ltd.
in this series, the shares were
around $1.45 and four weeks earlier had
touched a low point for 1966 of $1.28.
While not designated as a recovery
stock by any financial writers, recovery
has certainly taken place and, as at
the time of writing, the last sale was
at the price of $1.70, which seems to
have been the price at which London
decided to sell just over four months
ago.
The turnovers and mean prices for
each of the last six months are of
some interest:
Month June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov.
Turnover ’OOO
shares .. 80.9 86.5 147.3 45.4 61.1 100.9
Price range—

Mean .. 1.76 1.72 1.60 1.45 1.33 1.47
In the first two weeks of December,
the share price has risen 13 cents on a
turnover which is unlikely to have ex-
ceeded 20,000 shares. In September, the
price fell by a similar amount, also on
a very low turnover. This suggests that
the market price of the shares over the
last few months has been determined
much more by technical factors than
by fundamental factors a condition
which many will regard as permanent
and applicable to all stocks. However,
I think that these technical conditions
stemmed from fundamental considera-
tions and I will try to explain them,
as I see them.
London does not suffer any inhibi-
tions about selling out entire holdings
of a stock. “London” in this particular
case means certain types of institutional
holders, mainly investments trusts where
Australian securities form only a small
percentage of a total portfolio of inter-
national securities. The reasons for a
decision to sell may be varied and not
necessarily related to long-term thinking.
About the same time, it had become
obvious to local investors that retail
sales had levelled out quite markedly
and that profits for the 1965-6 year
(which in most cases ends on July 31)
were unlikely to be higher than those
of the preceding year.
Grace Bros, was perhaps regarded
with some particular concern because,
at that stage, no one knew whether
Roselands had been a profitable ven-
ture, although there was little doubt
that it had been well accepted by the
shopping public.
At it turned out, Grace Bros, earnings
for 1965-6 increased by 12 percent after
writing off all Roselands pre-opening
and promotional expenses and the earn-
ing rate rose fractionally. If we look
at “trading profit” (net profit before
tax, depreciation, interest, and all pro-
visions and non-recurring items), growth
continued in 1965-6 at a quite extra-
ordinary rate. The percentage increases
from year to year in this figure have
been as follows:
Year 1962-3 1963-4 1964-5 1965-6
percent. 31 28 26 29
The percentage increase in 1965-6 is
remarkable since retail sales in New
South Wales showed the smallest per-
centage increase for a number of years,
so Grace Bros, must have increased its
share of the market quite considerably.
When it comes to it, the analyst has
to try to translate this growth in sales
or in gross income into growth in earn-
ings per share and this involves some
guesswork. I have made my estimates
on the basis that “non-recurring” items,
such as Roselands pre-opening expenses,
are included as earnings; it has also
been assumed that this “income” was
not available for tax deduction. In this
case, I get the following series as earn-
ings per share over the past five years.:
Year to
July 31 1963 1964 1965 1966
Earnings per
share % 16.4 21.2 21.8 24.8
When translated into index form,
earnings and dividends per share have
grown as follows:
Year to July 1963 1964 1965 1966
Index 1962 = 100
earn per share 125 153 169 188
div. per share 112 126 133 140
With dividends per share growing
over the past four years at an average
annual compound rate of 8.8 percent
and earnings per share growing at about
17 percent, it is difficult to believe that
Grace Bros, were over-priced at $1.70,
at which level they show an earnings
yield of 7.3 percent and a dividend yield
of 3.7 percent. Without taking anything
into account except the recent rate of
growth of earnings, one would be in-
clined to suggest that the shares should
be priced at about 22 times earnings.
In other words, the share price is
reasonable up to $2.70.
Clearly, one must take some sort of
account of risk. I would believe that
the share would not be over-priced up
to a level of $2.00 per share. The past
record is excellent and a growth rate
of about 15 percent per annum can
surely be expected for another five
years at least.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
N.Z. the Key to Felts
NEW ZEALAND is the key to Felt
and Textiles’ ability to maintain
its wobbly looking but long standing ten
percent dividend. In pricing the 50 cent
shares under par for the first time in
many years, the market is far from con-
fident about Felts’ chances of holding its
old rate. And the latest figures look bad
enough (with earnings down to only
11.3 percent on capital) to give some
weight to this bearish view.
But things may not be as bad as
they look, despite the chairman’s recent
reports of lower sales and operating
profits in its Australian operations for
the first four months of the current
financial year. For not only have past
tax losses enabled the Australian net
profit for this period to remain “in line”
with the previous year; this result repre-
sents a much improved performance
(with the exception of its wool pocess-
ing and merchandising operations) over
the depressed second half of 1965-66,
which had caused last year’s profit
downturn.
The greater use of tax losses so far
this year by the Australian companies
(probably from last year’s “substan-
tial” tedding losses) could suggest that
last year’s tax rate of 39 percent on pre-
tax profit (helped along by investment
allowances on new plant) may be lower
in the current year; in the previous year
the rate had been as low as 35 percent.
Investment allowances should remain
fairly high in the current year, as the
company still had about $l.B million
conimitted to capital projects at the
end of June (compared with the pre-
vious June’s stated commitment of $2.4
million) and presumably some propor-
tion of that would be spent in Aus-
tralia.
Provided the Australian operations at
least hold their own at last year’s de-
pressed levels, the company’s dividend
looks secure. For New Zealand has be-
come the key to Felt and Textiles’ pros-
perity. There the company’s “favorable
trend in sales and profits” has been
maintained so far this year, and direc-
tors expect “a further satisfactory re-
sult.”
L as ,t year, the 57.3 percent-owned
N.Z. subsidiary earned a pre-tax
profit 50 percent greater than the
parent’s (on half the sales volume) and
46 percent of the net profit attributable
to shareholders in Felts. This has fol-
lowed a staggering rise in the role of the
N.Z. operation; since 1962-63 its propor-
tion of net profit has trebled. And, in
money terms, it has gone up 2J times in
the past three years.
So New Zealand’s greater significance
has not been only because of the cutting
in half of the group’s Australian earn-
ings over the past two years from the
puffed-up profits of 1963-64. These
had jumped by two-thirds in that year
following Felts’ disposal of the South
African subsidiary and so had enabled
the group to keep its earnings remark-
ably high. But now the Australian
operations are back to less than taws;
last year they earned $BOO,OOO, about
$lBO,OOO below the 1962-63 figure after
being as high as $1.6 million in 1963-64.
Despite the apparent fall in N.Z. profits
in the latest accounts by $25,000 to
$700,000, in effect the N.Z. contribution
increased at the rate of 21 percent on a
monthly average, since the previous year
had included 15 months of N.Z. earn-
ings.
AND the same reason turned an appar-
ent fall in N.Z. sales of $6.2
million (or 15 percent) to $32.5 mil-
lion into a 12-month rise of $1.3 mil-
lion (or 4.2 percent). However, there
was nothing illusory about the fall in
Australian sales, which dropped $2.3
million or 3.7 percent to $60.6 million.
Most of the group’s problems clearly
came from the parent company itself
rather than its Australian subsidiaries.
Parent sales fell by a thumping s9|
million or 17 percent to $45.2 million
(accompanied by a 25 percent reduc-
tion in debtors, but only a 7 percent
fall in stocks), and parent company
profits from its own operations fell by
$lBO,OOO to only $333,124, or 36 per-
cent. This fall accounted for 60 percent
of the Australian profit downturn, so
that the wool-processing subsidiary
(which is one of several that did worse
last year) could have accounted for
only a small proportion of the total
fall, even though it takes up a large
proportion of the chairman’s address.
In any event, the poor performance of
the parent company is evident from the
fact that it contributed 75 percent of
the group’s Australian sales, but only
40 percent of its Australian profits.
It appears that the major cause of
lower Australian profits came from a
drop in sales of pressed felts (due
partly to the lag in motor vehicle
sales) and footwear. However, the end
of some activities, such as the sale of
the interest in Waverley Wool and
ceasing production of knitted garm-
ents in Queensland, both of which
would have affected sales figures,
may have helped profits a little. In
any event, the N.Z. sales rise offset
all but one percent of the Australian
sales fall, leaving group turnover for
1966 at $93.1m.
The N.Z. company is also expanding
faster; sl.4' million of last year’s net
s2£ million outlay on plant was in
N.Z., where Felts is heavily protected
against import competition (and in view
of the state of N.Z.’s balance of pay-
ments position, is likely to remain so
for many years). Considerable expan-
sion of the manufacturing capacity of
worsted yarn spinning and carpets in
N.Z. has been undertaken. The takeover
of Francis Willey (N.Z.) Ltd. in 1964-
65 increased the N.Z. company’s
strength in wool trading, so that the
N.Z. purchases of greasy and scoured
wool has stepped up from 38,000 to
122,000 bales since 1963-64, to even
exceed the Australian company’s pur-
chase of 119,000 bales (2£ percent of
the total Australian clip) in the latest
term.
Wool processed by the N.Z. organi-
sation has increased from 7.4 m. .to
10.5 m. lb., compared with Australia’s
latest figure of 39.2 m. lb., which is 24-
percent of the output of processed wool
in Australia.
After the 1964-65 one-for-two bonus,
the N.Z. company, thanks to two gener-
ally prosperous years for the economy
as a whole, was able to maintain the
12| percent dividend, thus remitting 50
percent more to Australia, and so off-
setting the loss of the South African
subsidiary in dividend terms (and soon,
by the look of things, in earnings terms,
too). The South African subsidiary,
which had provided 40 percent
($860,000) of group profits excluding
minority interests in 1962-63, had only
been able to remit $204,000 in dividends
after South African withholding tax.
The s4.Bm. proceeds of the South
African sale were soon swallowed up
in capital expenditure on land and
buildings, and plant, which for the
past three years was $ 10.66 m. in Aus-
tralasia and Malaysia (an initial
$134,000).
AUSTRALIAN investors in Felts
probably have more to fear from
serious problems in the N.Z. economy
than from the Australian wool process-
ing and merchandising problems that the
chairman pointed out in his recent
address to shareholders. And, despite the
sound case he made in national inter-
est terms, the prospects of doing really
well out of this part of the business do
not look very bright at present, even
though something may eventually be
done about it. Nevertheless, the fact
that the company suffered a profit fall
from higher turnover in an operation
in which it appears to be relatively
efficient is disturbing. The, situation
is grim enough to provoke the chair-
man (Sir Robert Webster) to declare
in his 1966 address that Felt and Tex-
tiles would be better off to close down
its wool operations completely, realise
the stocks (readily salable on inter-
national markets) and debtors, meet
its liabilities, and invest the funds at
going rates of interest.
He has, of course, no intention’ of
doing so, but was bringing it home to
the Government that the processors of
wool needed as much assistance and
encouragement as the producers of the
raw wool. Their margins are squeezed
by growing costs, and the resistance of
overseas buyers to paying high prices
for wools when synthetics are trending
downward in price, although improv-
ing in variety and quality. Buyers
expected more stability in wool prices
and long credit terms, yet the pro-


cessors had to carry stocks months
ahead to fulfil orders and did not re-
ceive payment for perhaps five months
after shipment. The processing industry
therefore requires abnormally high in-
vestment in working capital alone.
Felts’ troubles lie in the highly com-
petitive overseas market for tops, and
acute world-wide difficulties in the
secondary processing wool industry. Yet
the company is performing a task that
should be done here, in processing a
local raw material into usable form in
this country, so that the export income
gained is not just from the raw
material but also includes a processing
content. Felts earned Australia about
sl| million in overseas exchange from
this operation last year. It extended
its wooltop-making capacity in 1964
by a rationalisation move whereby
Felts took over Yarra Falls’ topmaking
and combing division at Abbotsford,
and Yarra Falls took over Felts’ worsted
spinning, weaving, and cloth-finishing
divisions at Bentleigh. But the profit
margin in tops is now negligible, re-
ports the company.
JTELTS’ topmaking and combing sub-
sidiary, James Seymour, which was
working to capacity six days a week,
three shifts daily, at the time of the
annual meeting, has since cut back to
a five-day working week. In Australia
and New Zealand, Felt and Textiles
has a co-ordinated policy by which the
product of one plant becomes the raw
material of another. In both countries
Felts scours and carbonises wool, but
in Australia it also makes wooltops.
This further stage of processing in part
accounts for the relatively lesser
profitability of the Australian opera-
tions.
The gloom pervading in Felts’ wool
operations also seeps over into its bon-
ded fabrics, industrial felts, and bedding
in Australia. Profits fell in the plastic
materials, clothing, and needled felts
and wadding divisions, even though
sales were higher or at least maintained.
Sales of rubber products were held and
profit tose slightly; embroidery was
better on both counts, but this is only
a small part of operations. Footwear,
which was a major contributor to pro-
fits, has been hit recently by cheap im-
ports from China and Italy, and pro-
duction declined 16 percent in 1966.
Profits were reduced, but still represent
a material contribution. Felts is increas-
ing its activity in low-priced footwear.
New Zealand is a protected economy,
so that, for instance, where there is
practically no imports competition on
soft floor coverings over there, in Aus-
tralia, where it is also a major activity,
the Australian company has to meet
quite vigorous competition from Eng-
land. The Australian organisation was
unable to pass on increasing costs and
had to contend with heavier imports,
lack of buoyancy in the auto industry,
and absence of growth in certain retail
sales.
The major area for growth and op-
timism in Australia at present seems to
be in floor coverings. Soft floor cover-
ings, woven and tufted carpets, woollen
and blended with synthetics, and even
pure synthetics, sold higher for in-
creased net earnings. Technical difficul-
ties prevented the hard floor coverings
division from profiting to the full from
a substantial sales lift. In the first four
months of the current year, floor cover-
ings’ sales showed a substantial increase,
even though group sales, partly due to
lower wool values, eased three percent.
The market has taken Sir Robert’s
warning to heart, and knocked the
50c shares down to 5c below par from
a high of 69c this year. This price
could prove rewarding in the long term
for those prepared to put considerable
faith in the skill of Felts’ management
—and in the N.Z. economy.

COMMODITIES
Some Action-packed Markets
THE past year has been, as usual,
an action-packed, if not always
fun-filled, one for commodities
markets. Copper set a new high, sugar
a new low (allowing for monetary in-
flation), uranium started its long-
awaited awakening, the U.S. took first
steps toward revitalising the cotton in-
dustry, and tin finally touched the sup-
port price.
Over the coming year, different com-'
modities will continue to meet their own
individual problems: but increasing talk
and indications of a levelling out of the
United States’ remarkable industrial
boom may provide an overall dampener.
The extent to which this great economic
expansion and its world-wide reverbera-
tions have buoyed markets for virtually
all primary products is hard to measure,
but has certainly been considerable.
COPPER? Will the Vietnam war es-
calate or end; will Rhodesia win or
lose; will President Frei of Chile
continue to keep the mine workers in
hand, or will mines again close?
Assuming that all these possible in-
fluences only maintain the present level
of disorder, or perhaps improve, the
copper market should turn lower. On
the whole it seems quite likely that
copper prices will be lower a year hence.
They could be much lower, and in the
next year or two the old £stg.234 price
may not seem so distant.
MARKETS continue to expand for
beach sands, rutile, ilmenite,
zircon, monazite, etc., while
prices are kept level with the help of
some producer co-operation. The
future is bright for the main end-
products, pigments and titanium metal,
while on the production side the new
Sierra Leone plant has set problems
which will delay competition from
this major source.
LEAD and zinc, the “brother” base
metals, have been going their
separate ways for over six months.
The producers exercise greater control
over the zinc market because of the
minor part played by scrap supplies.
They have, first by buying on the LME
and then by cutting output, held the
£stg,lo2 a ton produce price, although
the free market has been below this
level for months.
Lead is down to £BO, and it will fall
lower next year. And it is quite probable
that the zinc price, too, will be lower in
12 months’ time possibly much lower
if some miners tire of running under
capacity.
THERE at present is no sign of
anything likely to move tin either
way from its well-supported
£l2OO a ton price. The U.S. has
shown rather clearly that its stockpile
releases will be regulated with an
eye to maintaining this price. As
these releases will be needed in the
foreseeable future to fill the gap be-
tween demand and production, there
is not much room for market moves.
THE London price of the tungsten
ores, wolfram and scheelite, has
recently been creeping higher. On
the whole the influences are likely to
continue upward, for both the main
sources, U.S. stockpiles and China’s
mines, have been keeping the flow to
carefully regulated levels.
Because of the fixed price of U.S.
stockpile releases, the market is gradu-
ally meeting upward resistance, how-
ever, and the 350/- peak of earlier this
year will probably not be bettered by
much or for long.
SPECULATION in silver is heavy,
and 4967 has been forecast as the
year for the first lift in the metal’s
price since 1963. A vast amount of silver
is contained in U.S. coinage, now being
replaced by non-silver tokens. The
Treasury has in the past sold its stocks
to keep the metal’s price low enough
to discourage melting down the coinage.
When the new coins have been minted
in sufficient numbers it will no longer
be necessary to hold this level; but on
the other hand, all the old coins will
become available as a source of the
metal after the price goes up only a
few cents.


Chess Bulletin
RUDOLFO TAN CARDOSO
THE recent Australian tour by
Rudolfo Tan Cardoso, spon-
sored by the Iligan Integrated
Steel Mills Inc., had a double
purpose. As Cardoso is the one
and only International Chess
Master of the Philippines it is
only fitting that he should repre-
sent that country at the Canter-
bury (N.Z.) Centennial Chess
Tournament.
This big event is to commence
on or about Boxing Day and
players from other countries in-
clude Russian Grandmaster Yuri
Averbakh and America’s John
Alexander. Also in the large field
is Ortvin Sarapu, champion of
Zone 10.
The second mission of Cardoso
is to try to establish a greater
bond of unity between member
countries of Zone 10. Countries
in this zone are: Philippines,
Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaya,
Indonesia, Singapore, Australia,
and New Zealand. Up to the
present the only contact between
these members has been at the
Zonal tournament held every
four years.
The moVe initiated by the
Philippines is to hold more regu-
lar tournaments and to bring out
a monthly publication devoted
mainly to Zone 10 chess infor-
mation.
Almost ten years ago the then
19-year-old Cardoso achieved
international fame by recording
the best individual score at the
12th Chess Tournament of
Nations. In this he scored 13
points for the Philippines out of
a possible 17.
Here is a good example of his
style from that olympiad. His
opponent is P. Reissman, of
Puerto Rico, and the brief

SPECULATORS DIARY
Looking Back on the Year
Between the "terribly right and terribly wrong"
WITH only a few days of this year to go, it seems an appropriate time to
reminisce on some of the transactions in the diary in 1966. I have only
chosen those that have turned out to be terribly right or terribly wrong.
Vanity makes me mention the successful ones first.
In March, I had this to say about
Amalgamated Chemicals: “Put options
seem to be the order of the day. A put
option on Amalgamated Chemicals
shares was taken out at $1.35, because
I expect a very sharp reaction in the
share price once the successful offer
goes through.” I concluded that I
would be quite satisfied if the shares
steadied out at a dollar. This estimate
of the fall turned out to be conserva-
tive. The shares touched 65 cents at one
point but have since recovered to 70
cents.
A few months later, F. W. Williams
shares were purchased at $3.05, “not
because of the management’s ability to
earn profits but rather for the opposite
reason —because of the management’s
apparent inability to use its very con-
siderable assets. If the present directors
can’t produce results from assets of $5
a share then perhaps others can.”
The “others” turned out to be Martin
Corporation and Pioneer Concrete.
After a lengthy battle, Pioneer Concrete
has emerged the victor.
The following comment was made
about Cottees in a form review back in
April: “Heavily backed in all its recent
races. Would not surprise to see it score
in Takeover Cup in June.” And score
it did. The prizemoney of $4.20 cash
for every share was paid by General
Foods.
Let us look at the other side of the
picture.
In April, Nuttall shares were pur-
chased at 70 cents “because the mar-
ket did not appreciate that lower pro-
fits were due to non-recurring costs.”
Within six months, the shares had
managed to halve in price. You might
have described this transaction as pre-
mature!
; ANOTHER not-so-favorable purchase
was TNT at $1.53, “because I
figured that the shares would be worth
much more than this in any takeover.”
The “reverse” takeover by the Cargo
Distributors group was equivalent to
$1.59. But like the more recent partial
takeover of Frank O’Neill by Dunlop,
the market was unimpressed by the price
paid. TNT shares are now selling at
$1.29.
Probably the most vivid memory of
misjudgment was Western Mining.
These shares were sold at $3.10, “be-
cause a rise of 40 cents in one hit was
too tempting to resist.” Working on this
principle, I would have sold Western
Mining ten times in the past six months!
If I’d made it $4, the portfolio would
have shown an increase in profits of
$720 last financial year.
Western Mining must go down as
1966 of the year. On the other
hand, Consolidated Goldfields takes the
prize for stock of the month. For those
who got the stock in the float, it wasn’t
a case of whether they would make a
profit but just how much profit! Direc-
tors of Consolidated Goldfields must
have been feeling in a very generous
mood when the terms of the issue were
decided.
A market price of $4 puts Consoli-
dated Goldfields into the same high
price bracket as CRA. With a yield
of 2\ percent, Consolidated Goldfields
has been pushed up into the specula-
tion class.
For the time being, I’ll stick to in-
dustrials, and the one for me this week
is Hanimex. After several years of
rapidly rising earnings, profits suddenly
levelled off last year. This, however,
should prove to be only a pause before
the next upward surge. Apart from the
current year being helped by the re-
covery of the photographic industry in
Australia, a favorable decision in the
recent tape recorder tariff inquiry would
boost profits enormously. Hanimex is
the only manufacturer of tapes and tape
recorders in Australia. Some weeks ago,
the shares suddenly moved up to $1.50,
but have since settled back to $1.45_
I bought 200.
Transactions this week were:

PLATER'S FILTER "GALLERY EDITION"
PLATE No. 8. Selection of works by Vincent van Gogh. (Holland)
Vincent van Gogh was twenty-eight before he turned his attention to art. Up till that time,
he had worked with a firm of picture dealers and as a lay preacher, being dismissed from
both positions. □ Van Gogh's early works were gloomy paintings reflecting the bitterness of
his past experiences. After living in Paris for two years, his work gained new life from the
examples of the Impressionist painters. Yet his individuality took him far beyond the confines
of Impressionism. At Arles, in Provence, he became completely himself and single of
purpose. □ He painted furiously, his balance of colour and design expressing the emotion
created in him by the character of each subject. □ His first attack of madness occurred at
Arles, and resulted in the famous ear incident. Later, he was removed to the lunatic asylum at
Saint Remy. □ Early in the following year, he was able to visit his brother Theo in Paris, then
went under the care of Doctor Gachet at Anvers. He threw himself completely into his
painting, until in 1890, feeling another attack of madness looming, he shot himself.
