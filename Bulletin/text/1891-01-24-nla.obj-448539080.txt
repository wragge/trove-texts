SUFFERING FROM
BRAIN & NERVE EXHAUSTION.
Any man who in his youth hag trifled away his vigour
of body, mind, and manhood, should consult PRO-
FESSOR CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the greatest skill and success all Private,
Nervous, and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINBWAY’S great success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : — 1st. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Electric
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I,SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline.de., can
recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in / ersen or by letter, which is free),
Professor CARL STiNEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood
after all other treatment had failed. It makes
no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that / accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanently cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION : —Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ! Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the pow nof will and action? Are
you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits ? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single
consultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed
on the way to health strength, and vigour ?

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Liabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Bo tr lof JV.S. W. L ite House Sur-
geon to the Great Southern Hospital. London
I am aware that I am not strictly following- the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the tieatm nt of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov.
6th, 7th and Bth. 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight those pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from these disease?, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider, therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which note exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
Iffy Qualification* I InviteAhe fullett Investigation Into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to tKe
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observln { the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexua 1 System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at tho
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the £tudy of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

Showing plainly how all diseases of tho private or
nervous system may bo cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though jou bo perfectly well its general infofm-
tioa and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for tho cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced Symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by Are,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, find
; has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery arid distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,

diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since lie has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-

have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may b, as well to let them know that there issuch
an . rtioie as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the prod action of thecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the

so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guaranteed Free from all Poisonous

Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application wall relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great _ demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
_ Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen ;
Statutory Declaration.
_ “I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :—-
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured,
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
How’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See wliat a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them moat
excellent, and superior to many others that 1 have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1880.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW ’S DAN DE L 1 ON
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afficted as i haVe
been may take ad vantage of them.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 24, 1891.
Compulsory Voting.
The conviction is becoming widespread that,
so far, Representative Government, like the
mountebank at a rustic fair, has not fulfilled
the programme of its promise. In many
countries it has superseded the direct rule of
monarchs and of aristocracies ; but, in the
majority of cases, it would be hard to say
what real advantage the great body of the
people has derived from the transfer of
power. To the donkey in the fable it made
little difference whether he was burdened
and beaten by his master, the husbandman,
or by the invaders who were pouring into
the country, and who would, no doubt,
requisition him to assist in dragging an
ammunition-waggon. Yet the theory of
Representative Government is perfect. When
states or communities are small, the whole
people can assemble and make their laws
there and then without the intervention of
any delegates. When they are populous, or
the population scattered, such a process
would be impossible. It, therefore, becomes
necessary to choose certain men, instruct
them what to do, and let them do it. This
is simplicity itself. How comes it, then,
that in practice this attractively plain theory
so frequently fails'? We shall attempt to
point out some of the causes, and indicate at
least one remedy. Compulsory voting is the
latter. There is no reason to suppose that
it will solder all the holes in the State kettle—
but there is every reason to suppose that it
will stop some of them.
* # #
To explain matters it is necessary to go
back somewhat in time. The principle of
government by representation was discovered
and introduced into England by a French-
man named De Montfort. Possibly for
this, among other things, his head and hands
were cut off by Edward the First—the
greatest of the Plantagenets. Why the
monarch should have gone to the trouble of
removing the ingenious Frenchman’s hands,
having first removed his head, is not very
clear. This occurred considerably over six
hundred years ago, and, so decorously in
England does freedom “ broaden down from
precedent to precedent,” that to-day there
are perhaps millions of Englishmen who do
not enjoy the franchise. Indeed, men now
living can call to mind when half the
members of the House of Commons were
mere nominees of the aristocracy ; when the
whole United Kingdom contained but a few
thousand voters ; when seats were put up to
auction like cattle in a sale-yard, and when
some electorates contained but one voter
who always put himself in Parliament, except
when paid to keep out of it. To call such a
system a representative one merely shows -
that, on occasions, the Briton has a fine sense
of humour. It would, therefore, be mani-
festly unfair to assert that, because the
British system was never more than a quali-
fied success, and generally a mischievous
failure, parliamentary institutions stand con-
demned. It never was a truly representative
system from its rise in the thirteenth cen-
tury ; it is not now, in the nineteenth.
* * *
But there are countries where the franchise
is now and has long been, universal. -In such
lands, has the emancipation of the masses
brought about the benefits anticipated ? Un-
fortunately, the answer must be negative to
be true. Only a fraction of those entitled to
vote take the trouble to attend the poll at
all, while even the clearly-expressed wishes
of those who attend are too often thwarted
or subjected to irritating delays by the very
persons appointed to give them effect. It is
strange that it should be so, but it is true
as strange. Thus the precise object for
which popular rule was instituted—viz., to
quickly ascertain what a majority of the
people desired, and to rapidly carry that
desire into execution—is warped at the very
outset, by the supineness of the people
themselves in the first place, and by the
supineness or trickery of their delegates in
the second. We use the word delegate
advisedly. Many members of legislative
chambers object to it, and say, with some
hauteur, “We are not delegates, we are
representatives, and, as such, insist on venti-
lating our own opinions.” This position is
clearly untenable. Men are not elected to
express their own views, or to legislate as
they think proper. They are chosen to
express the views of others, and to make
the laws those others desire. If intending
candidates for Parliament have fixed opinions
of their own on the utility or inutility of
certain proposals, they should seek elec-
torates where such opinions are in the
ascendant. But it is only one remove from
impudence for a man to accept a commis-
sion to forward certain views and then
to delay or decline to act, as those
views are not consonant with his
own. It is as if a property-owner gave his
agents instructions to sell a house for £lOO,
and next day received information to say it
was disposed of for £5O, as the agent was of
opinion it was worth no more.
* * #
There is here a difficulty at the very out-
set, to which it is but fair to give due
Aveight. The majority of the electors of a
country may demand law reform, or local
government, or any other measure of a
comprehensive nature. But it would be
too much to expect them to go into all the
particulars or minutiae of the desired change.
They may not have time, or they may not
have training. In such cases, the margin
of individual opinion conferred upon
the delegate is necessarily widened. It
is, then, his duty to assist in giving pro-
per shape to the general tenor of his con-
stituents’ views on intricate subjects. Still,
no such latitude is allowed him in cases
which admit of but a simple “yes” or
“ no.” For him to equivocate or delay, or
say “ no,” when the electors deputed him to
say “yes,” is absurdity in excelsis , So far
as we have gone, then, it would appear that
nowhere has universal suffrage been so suc-
cessful as anticipated. If kings have been
deposed or rendered powerless, Cabinets
have taken their places. These Cabinets
lead instead of obeying. If aristocracies
have disappeared or been curtailed of their
privileges, Parliamentary majorities have
succeeded, so that with a few trifling
changes the masses of the people are much
where they were. Under what is called
Responsible Government, in Australia, and
more especially in New South Wales,
during the last few years, acts as
arbitrary have been done as under any
despotic monarch. Cabinets, in theory, are
supposed to be mere machines constructed
for but a single purpose—to carry into effect
the wish of the voters. Similarly, in theory,
the ballot-box is supposed to be the State’s
centre of gravity. How woefully short of
their theoretic value both suppositions fall is
known to the veriest tyro in public affairs.
* # *
The supineness of the ruled, and the
pursuit of self-interest on the part of the
rulers are the main factors in the compara-
tive failure of representative institutions. It
is volubility, not virtue, that carries the day.
A three-year tenure of power also, is
too long for any Parliament, particu-
larly a paid one. Annual, or at most
biennial, congresses should be the rule.
While the principle of payment of
of members is demonstrably sound, there is
an undoubted temptation offered by trien-
nial Parliaments to impecunious men to
dodge dissolutions. If it is said that
shorter terms would mean more frequently-
recurring popular turm oil, the answer is, in
the first place, that with vote by ballot there
is but little scope for undue excitement at
all ; and, in the second, that political agita-
tion is far preferable to political stagnation.
It is the swamp, not the stream, that breeds
most corruption. It may now be asked
“ what influence will obligatory voting have
on this deplorable state of affairs—how will
it mend matters ?” As intimated a few
paragraphs back, we do not put it forward
as a specific, but as a useful palliative. To
find a true specific for these and many other
ills—social, sexual and political—it is neces-
sary to travel far—to proceed until the high
portals seen by some of the most gifted of
men’s children are passed, and the fair
domain of Socialism comes in view. Not, be
it remembered, the phantom Socialism of the
raw head-and-bloody-bones, or Phrygian cap
pattern—the only kind known to the smug
capitalist who loafs oir the labours of others
--but the system that gives to every child
born into the world an equal start in the
race of life.
# # #
Suppose a constituency of 100 electors, 50
of whom refrain from voting. The candi-
date, say, is returned by a majority of one ;
in other words, he is pledged to carry out
the views of one-fourth of his constituency.
He may take it upon himself to ignore that
pledge, and yet be returned by a much
larger majority at the next election. For
many of those who abstained from attending
the poll on the one occasion may come
forward on the other, and uphold him in his
recalcitration. But if all, or nearly all, had
voted in the first instance, the probability of
his ratting would be reduced to a minimum.
The representative who, with a record of
broken pledges or of aimless obstruction,
would face a half-voting electorate with a
light heart, would have many misgivings
when facing a constituency where every
vote was polled on his previous wooing, and
where he was aware that every vote would
be recorded on his subsequent appeal.
* # #
Even under our present social and political
system of individualism, where, in popular
language, the motto is “ everyone for him-
self and the Devil take the hindmost,” the
citizen is under obligations which he is not
permitted to ignore. He is obliged to
Answer the questions set before him in a
census-paper ; to serve on juries when called
upon ; to take a part in defending the
country from invasion ; to assist the police
in securing a prisoner or quelling a disturb-
ance ; to see that his children attend school
during certain periods ; and to perform
other duties having for their object the pre-
servation or progress of society. It is only
by risking his lucre or his liberty that he
can refuse to comply with these obligations.
But if it be penal to keep children from
school lest they should grow up in ignorance
and so endanger society’s safety, how much
more deserving of penalties is it to endanger
the well-being of that society by neglecting
to take a part in choosing the delegates who
are to lay down laws for its guidance ? In
many countries men are deprived of their
civil rights for various offences. It may at
first sight seem absurd to deprive men of
the right of voting when, while possessing
it, they evince no desire to exercise it. It
appears like depriving a man of a privilege
of which he would gladly be rid. Yet there
is little doubt that a law disfranchising for a
longer or shorter term those who so far for-
get their duties as to neglect recording their
votes, would have a salutary effect. If by
experience it was found that they thought
little of the deprivation, other means for
impressing upon them their duties would
speedily be devised. With society as at
present constituted we, in common with
many who have devoted time and attention
to the momentous social problems pressing
for solution, are by no means enamoured.
But while men who wish to leave the world
better than they found it look forward with
confidence to the advent of a society based
upon the best rather than upon the worst
human qualities—founded upon man’s nobler
instincts, instead of upon his vilest—they
see no reason why the most may not
be made of things as they are. In a
word, they see no reason why the person
who has the right to vote for a delegate
commissioned to make laws binding on all
should not be compelled to exercise that
right, just as he is compelled to give his
children a schooling which tends to enhance
their value as citizens of a presumedly free
community.
A“Vigorous Borrowing Policy."
One of the most conspicuously probable state-
ments which has been published in the Austra.
lian press for the last ten years is that which
announces the intention of the new Government
at Perth to pursue “ a vigorous borrowing
policy,” for the expansion of the country and
the greater profit of the land-grabber and the
monopolist generally. It is very seldom indeed
that Australia is not borrowing vigorously, and
as further examples of this great national
tendency New South Wales and Victoria have
simultaneously resolved to float another huge
1.0. U. apiece on the London market, and
Queensland has her impecunious eye fixed in
the same direction, and South Australia and
Tasmania are expected to follow the general
example at a later period in the year, and they
all intend simply to borrow the money and pass
the consequences on to posterity. As a rule
the Australian States are tolerably unanimou s
in the matter of loans, but this year they are a
little more unanimous than usual because there
is an unexpected superfluity of money in
England, and the English investor has even a
greater difficulty than usual in finding a profit-
able outlet for his surplus cash. Nine-tenths of
the English nation, it is true, have virtually no
cash at all ; and at least one-tenth consists of a
mass of practically homeless outcasts who are
starving amid the snow and frost; and the
hungry pauperism of England is sufficient to
make a procession of human skeletons three
hundred miles in length, but the statement
that money is abundant takes no notice of these
facts. It merely signifies that somewhere
about one million inhabitants of the United
Kingdom are a little better off than usual, and,
therefore, that the others are a little worse off
and more liable to freeze and die and go to
eternal perdition ; and in consequence of these
things the market is in a favourable conditiot
for further borrowing.
* # #
A period of conspicuous prosperity in any oi
the Australian states is invariably the period
which immediately follows the raising of a big
loan, and the next period of prosperity is when
another big loan has been raised to enable the
colony to stagger along under the burden of the
one which went before it. In between the two
loans there is always a time of depression, and
an unemployed problem, and a shortage in the
national finances, and the only known remedy
for any of these evils is some more loans. In
these intervals of artificial poverty there is
manifested a tendency on the part of the hun-
gry, unreasoning masses to vote against the
(Government on the general principle that some-
thing is wrong, and someone must be respon-
sible for the wrong, and there is also a growing
inclination to rise, in a vague, uncertain way,
against the stupendous monopolies of land and
capital, which have already so utterly ruined
Australia that even a whole continent cannot
provide employment and bread for four millions
of inhabitants. And when a more or less intel-
ligent nation begins to demand the reason why
it should be hungry in the midst of an empty
Paradise, and gropes in the dark with only an
unutterable sense of injury to guide it for the
cause of its troubles, it is necessary to do some-
thing in order to postpone the day of reckoning
and make the problem last long enough to be
handed down to posterity. The readiest way
to shove the great difficulty on to the ensuing
generation lies in that process which is termed
the “absorption of surplus labour,” and the
easiest means of absorbing surplus labour is the
construction of a new railway in some unoccu-
pied region of drought and old, extinct craters;
and, therefore, as already mentioned, the
Government floats another loan, and leaves the
repayment of the same to whomever may chance
to come after.
* 4 #
The immediate effects of tfris progress are
various and complex. The first result of the
new railways or other public works is to boom
the property of the adjacent capitalist, and this
process is erroneously termed a revival of pro-
gress. Generally that astute proprietor takes
advantage of the unnatural inflation to sell out
in small lots, and at an enormous profit, to a
race of simple-minded inhabitants ; and then he
probably starts for England with the proceeds,
and becomes an honored and respected citizen in
the land of his fathers. By this proceeding
the first half of the loan generally vanishes out of
Australia shortly before the second half is mopped
as interest by British financiers who made pre-
vious advances. When the borrowed money is
exhausted, and the sudden financial delirium has
diet! away, the property which has been thus
traded off on the community generally falls
back in value, and the speculators, who mistook
a brief attack of monetary drunkenness for an
evidence of permanent prosperity, are badly
left. Then the townships which were marked
out in the wilderness vanish again into their
primitive obscurity, and the dingo howls on the
alleged “esplanade,” and the wallaby hops
over the site where the the Town-hall ought to
have been, and ultimately the Financial Agency
or Universal Permanent Discount Association-
run by British capital—forecloses on the lot,
and pays a considerable dividend in London on
the strength of the transaction. But for the
time, at all events, the public distress is
alleviated and the alleged “surplus labour”
finds employment. A great part of the loan
goes in buying land at an enormous valuation
to clear the way for the new improvements,
and most of the balance is spent on imported
railway and other material; but still a small
amount is left to be expended in wages, in
order that the electors of the colony may not
be provoked into firing the Government into
the gutter. But, as a rule, the sum which is
actually expended in the country is barely
enough to pay the first year’s deficiency on the
new lines and the loss incurred through the
breaking of the land-boom which attended the
undertaking in its earlier stages, and the
interest of the loan itself is a dead-weight upon
the inhabitants; and consequently the old
scarcity and the old “unemployed difficulty”
start afresh almost before the alleged ‘ ‘ wave of
prosperity ” has fairly begun. Under these
circumstances the Government generally floats
another loan, because it lias never learned how
to do anything else, and passes the difficulty
on, just as it has been passed on ever since
borrowing first began.
* * *
Every now and then, however, Australia
undergoes a species of political awakening and
realises suddenly that some particular Govern-
ment is borrowing too freely and too fast, but,
as a rule, this fact only dawns on the public
comprehension when the loans have been raised
and spent, and the inevitable reaction has come
rounef. Then the Opposition appeals to the
people to put an end to this long period of
criminal extravagance, and the people, in the
majority of cases, respond nobly to the invita-
tion. In Australia Ministries almost invariably
fall on the question of finance, and when they
fall it is generally discovered that the loan
money has all been dissipated, and the trust-
funds borrowed, and that there is nothing in
particular remaining, except a shortage. Then
the new Ministry—which took office for the
express purpose of putting an end to borrowing
—is reluctantly compelled to raise a fresh loan
to finish the public works left uncompleted by
its predecessor, and to replace the trust funds,
and put things straight generally ; and when
these results are achieved it is generally driven
to the dire extremity of raising some more loans
to absorb, for the fiftieth time, that “surplus
labour ” which is floating about in a loose,
melancholy, unfriended state through tire
depression brought on by the fiendish Govern-
ment which went before it And when it has
finished doing these things, the previous
Government —now in Opposition usu illy starts
a fresh crusade because of the criminal stupidity
of the old Opposition—which is now the
Government; and when the two exchange
places once more the same old shortage turns
up just as it turned up previously, and there is
the same trouble about the borrowed trust-
funds and the unfinished public works, and the


“ surplus labour ” is found drifting about loose
in the same ancient style for want of some new
public works to give it employment. It is
needless to mention that, under these condi-
tions, the new Government starts by reluctantly
raising another loan. Even the sun is not more
regular than the inevitable loan.
# * #
The debts of Australia are an ever-increasing
quantity. In periods of prosperity the surplus
is invariably fooled away in increased salaries,
in bonuses to new industries or alleged indus-
tries, in prospecting-votes for the purpose of
hiring some politician’s uncle or relative to go
forth into the wilderness and look for gold
where no gold exists, in remissions of taxation
for the purpose of making the Cabinet’s calling
and re-election sure—in anything and every-
thing, in short, save in the reduction of the
nation’s liabilities; and in the periods of de-
pression which inevitably follow more liabilities
are floated to raise another burst of affluence.
The idea of ever wiping off any part of the
great national promissory-note is apparently
as foreign to the modern politician as the idea
of reverting to cannibalism and general naked-
ness ; he can no more grasp such a conception
than he can conceive the possibility of abolish-
ing feet, and running mankind on wheels. The
fact that a partial equivalent in the shape of
public w-orks will be handed down to futurity
along with this accumulation of debts and diffi-
culties is no justification, for the statesmen of
the present have traded away almost the entire
available surface of Australia, and this loss has
no approximate equivalent in the dubious legacy
of railways, irrigation works, and other assets
which will be passed on to the people of
succeeding years. The debts of this continent
represent actually nothing save the great prin-
ciple of living only for the present, and bequeath-
ing the insolvency and general smash which
may follow to the nation which comes after.
* * *
Australia, though poor, so far as the actual
amount of its wealth is concerned, is, in pro-
portion to population, almost the richest nation
to be found on earth. Yet even a whole conti-
nent cannot support 4,000,000 inhabitants when
the race of landlords, capitalists, importers,
miscellaneous monopolists and assorted finan-
ciers demand so much, and leave so very little
for the people at large. The “ surplus labour,”
which forms an ever-recurring problem in
Australian politics, represents that portion of
the nation which has been left behind in the
great scramble, because this continent is not
large enough to go round in the existing state
of society, and if the “surplus labourer” of
the present escapes from his unhappy condition,
and becomes a capitalist himself, lie can only
achieve that result by dragging someone else
down into the place which he lias quitted. If
Australia were ten times larger and more fertile
than it is, the landlord and the capitalist would
be richer, but the surplus labour would still
remain ; and if a thousand millions were
borrowed in place of ten, it would merely
postpone the difficulty for a few years, but the
remedy would remain as far off as ever. The
loan policy of Australia and the emigration
policy of “General” Booth in England are
two widely different expedients for the same
end ; the one seeks to shunt the question of
poverty on to a foreign country, and the other
to shunt the same question on to another
generation, but each is framed for the purpose
of passing the disease on to someone else, and
making things last a little while longer. But
when the Englishman can find no more places
to emigrate to, and the Australian can find no
one else to borrow from, then both nations will
have to face the question—Why the two richest
countries on earth cannot find employment and
food for their inhabitants? and somehow or
other the answer must be supplied.
The Bureaucrat and the People.
Dear Bulletin, — The gradual encroachment of
bureaucratic power on the liberties of the
people is the greatest danger which now
menaces national freedom. In no quarter of
the globe is this truth more apparent than in
Australia. The facts lately elicited in con-
nection with the maladministration of the New
South Wales Postal and Telegraph Departments
are a natural sequence to the vindictive sentence
Sassed upon Reseigh Martin for libelling the
r.S.W. Chief Commissioner for Railways.
# # #
It seems that the policy of the bureaucratic
ring is to cover with an impenetrable veil of
secresy the internal economy of every depart-
ment—to hide from the public those official acts
which concern the public most Can any cogent
reason be advanced in support of official secrecy
in the working of any department of the public
service, save that of the police ? Can any just
cause be alleged why arbitrary power should be
conferred on heads of departments ? By what
just right are civil servants paid princely
salaries from the public purse, their life interest
in permanent and lucrative employment secured,
and their frequent misfeasances either defended
or cloaked ? Have the public, then, no voice in
the administration of departments—have they
no voice in the government of the country, no
right to freely criticise the official action of a
well-paid public servant simply because he is
well-paid, and an overbearing Jack-in-office
“ clad in a little brief authority ?”
* # *
Freemen claim the right of free speech. The
servants of the public should be accountable
directly to the public ; they have, in common
with other members of a democratic community,
an opportunity to defend themselves from un-
just aspersion or unmerited calumny ; but it is
no more criminal, for any citizen to denounce,
through an erroneous report, the supposed
malfeasance of a bureaucrat than it is for an
audience in a theatre to hiss an unpopular-
actor. it,
* » tf *
The tactics of a certain section of the Govern-
ment in striving to suppress free speech, to
fetter and corrupt the Press, are all too obvious.
The proposal of a prominent politician to compel
contributors to the press to publish their “real
names ” in connection with their effusions, is
worthy of the spirit which vindictively en-
deavours to discover the author of the “ Post-
Office ” letters in the Protestant Stan-
dard. This course, if adopted, would
compel literary men who wished to benefit
or instruct the public, and who could not
conveniently seek publicity, to dictate their
“ copy ” to some ignorant jackdaw enabled thus
to strut in the borrowed plumage of real literary
merit. And everything adverse to political
rascality could be burked, unless the writer, in
publishing his name, could successfully resist
the onslaught of the whole pack of political
wolves and bureaucratic alligators, with their
legion of mercenary hangers-on and supporters.
* *
The utterances of the Maitland Mercury
and other New South Wales provincial papers
on the Eddy-Martin case indicate that very
few independent and outspoken papers exist in
New South Wales. The remainder are all
either poisonously subsidised by Government
advertisements, or by commercial advertise-
ments, or are supported by sectarian societies
subject to political cliques. When an estab-
lished newspaper becomes prosperous through
the sale of its principles, when it is wedded
solely to commercial interests, it becomes the
veriest slave of Mammon, the tool of the
oppressor, the advocate of legalised wrong, the
most powerful instrument of the political char-
latan and a curse to democracy. The “inde-
pendence ” of such papers is but the freedom of
a street sandwich-man. In the struggle of
National Freedom v. Bureaucracy it is all too
evident which side they will take.—Yours,
Australian.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Imported Titles.
Melbourne Age, anxious to rehabilitate its
former reputation for radicalism, has printed
an article which implies that the knighthoods
of MacBain, Davies, Benjamin and Co. are
contemptible jokes, and the baronetcy of
William Clarke a scandalous shame. The
chestnuts of the Age are very old, and have
appeared in The Bulletin any time during the
past ten years, but they are still sound and
good, and worth requoting. Says the Mel-
bourne journal of the local K.C.M.C.’s : —
If their titles perish with them no great harm will be
done ; they will spread their feathers peacock fashion,
exciting the envious admiration of a few simpletons, and
affording the many a laugh not quite untinged with con-
tempt. But to titles which descend from hither to son,
from the shrewd man who made the money to the com-
placent booby who squanders it, wc object much more
strongly, A snobocracy we must have, human nature
being what it is, but we need not predestinate men snobs
by making them heirs to titles which will cause a little
mob of sycophants to fawn on them from the hour at
which they cut their teeth to the day on which they lie
on their state-beds ready trussed for the undertaker.
From The Bulletin —in whose columns titles
are used as handles for turning ridicule upon
the system which creates them, or upon the
men who bear the badges — such plain truths
come with a good grace. But the Age stultifies
its burst of candour in every issue of the journal
by going out of its way to give these people the
satisfaction of seeing their “ Crown’’-granted
prefixes and affixes published in all seriousness.
We have ere now referred to the disgusting
alacrity with which newspapers make small
paragraph announcements of paltry events,
merely for the sake of working in the name of
some Sir Ponderous Ass, K.C.M.G,, or Sir
Addled Boozer, Bart., who puffed out a few re-
marks on the occasion in question. The Age is
every whit as bad as its dreary contemporaries
in this respect—ever ready to confer the dignity
of print, serious print, upon those titles that,
as it occasionally admits, never ought to have
been introduced into this country. And again,
we say that the daily Press has the power to
nullify the so-called “ honours ” conferred upon
our Australian bloatocracy by declining to let
the public know when the purchase of those
blessed honours is completed, and by reli-
giously refraining from any mention of any
Australian title whatsoever. Then, when a
person addressed Binjy Binjy as plain
“mister,” and Binjy replied, “Sir,” if you
please, the other person would merely say,
“ What are you giving us, Mister?” and pass
on. Whereupon Binjy would totter home and
die of baffled ambition, and when his obituary-
notice, setting forth his full title, was sent
round to the papers, the clerks would strike
out all the tommyrot and the world would
only notice that plain B.B. was no more.
———
In the Queen’s Name.
The Law, always ready to recognise distinction
of persons in favour of “ persons of distinction,”
makes no attempt to understand that some of
its statutes, although seeming to be absolutely
impartial in their dealings, are apt to press hard
or lightly upon citizens, just as they may chance
to be poor or rich. For example, Joshua Wood-
house has been fined (at the London County
Sessions), under a law which equally applies to
Australia, £20 for refusing to assist a police
constable when called upon by that functionary
in the Queen’s name. The constable was holding
on to an alleged thief, whom several roughs were
endeavouring to rescue, when he appealed to
Joshua. It was the duty of Woodhouse to
respond cheerfully, no doubt, but instead of
going straightway on the “ stoush” for the
glory of Victoria Regina, this unimpetuous
vulgarian put his hard, horny hands into the
pockets of his corduroys and walked away, say-
ing ; “ Not me ; I don’t want to get a hiding.”
Whereupon the law fined Joshua £20, as
it might have fined a “gentleman” for
a like failure to do his obvious duty
by the State — no man, Monarchist or
Republican, being legally entitled to plead
anything short of a bad leg as an excuse for
not coming up to the scratch under such cir-
cumstances. Yet Joshua, by rushing to the
assistance of the officer in distress, would
expose himself to risks (beyond the immediate
risk of being knocked silly) that don’t threaten
the casual influential stranger who does like-
wise. The latter, dwelling on the lofty eleva-
tion of respectability, can contrive to ignore
the existence of those very roughs who would
have constant opportunities for making things
awkward for Josh hereafter. The fear that he
might be privately requested to “wait until
they got him down their alley,” probably
decided Josh in favour of putting his hands in
his pockets. Maybe, too, he was mindful of
the social discomforts, not to say perils, which
might descend upon Mrs. Josh and the kids if
their “old man” got himself disliked by the
neighbours. Perhaps conjugal affection was at
the bottom of this poor, common person’s in-
disposition to offend men who could embitter the
whole future existence of his bride—but this
is a somewhat poetical conjecture. Asa matter
of hard fact the inhabitant of a “low” neigh-
bourhood stands, in the event of being called
upon to act as a special constable, at a serious
disadvantage compared with his wealthy fellow-
countrymen, and prudential ulterior considera-
tions, which need not trouble the citizen of
good means, may have naturally a deterrent
influence upon the struggling workman’s desire
to do the correct thing. All the ravings of high
morality and exalted patriotism cannot overrule
this practical truth. We don’t say that Joshua
Woodhouse, having little of his own to get
stolen, was less interested in the capture of a
thief than the Duke of Westminster would be,
but merely that he had a greater number of
possible consequences to fear. Yet, lacking wit
or education to put his case properly before a
Court that would rack its brains to find ex-
teimating circumstances for any wealthy misde-
meanant, Josh was fined by the Court just as
much as it could have fined a capitalist charged
with a less excusable shortcoming. Which was
another illustration of how the Law attempts
to atone for its flagrant injustice at some times
by being culpably stupid at others.

“ A Majority.”
The N.Z. Herald has struck a fresh mule—
this is a complicated figure of speech, but it ex-
presses the situation very well—on the advan-
tages of landlordism and the horrors of not
having a landlord :
Take the case of the 84,000 landowners of New Zealand.
Suppose them to be gradually replaced through legisla-
tive confiscation by a similar number of State tenants.
Reckoning population upon the basis of five to a family,
these holders under Government would represent 420,000
out of 020,000 souls, or two-thirds of the whole. This
majority would be a perpetual menace to the Govern-
ment, moulding it to its will. It could secure the almost
indefinite extension of the terms of tenancy. It would
have ample voting power to obtain the gradual lowering,
and, if so willed, the extinction of the tax. It requires
no great degree of foresight to convince us that
Georgianism worked out in fact must embark the country
adopting it in one perpetual round of disastrous revolu-
tions.
It would be a relief if the animal which in-
vented this argument would kindly come out of
his stable for five seconds and answer a few
questions. First of all, why should 420,000
tenants be more calculated to wreck the Maori
commonwealth than 420,000 landlords ? The
tenants’ majority, it seems, would be “a per-
petual menace to the Government, moulding it
at will,” but as the landlords are doing the
same just now things would be about square,
and anyhow the majority generally “moulds”
the Government—if the Herald found the
Government being moulded by anything else it
would probably complain about it. Secondly,
if the tenants would refuse to pay taxes because
they were the majority, why doesn’t the whole
nation refuse to pay now on the same basis, for
if it isn’t the majority in the largest sense of the
term, then the word is generally misunderstood?
Thirdly, if a majority is a “perpetual menace
to the Government,” what does the Herald
propose to do with it, and how will it fix up a
State in which everybody is in a minority and
every minority is smaller than every other
minority, so as to prevent the biggest minority
being a majority after all ? Fourthly, the fact
that the majority, under the Land Nationalisa-
tion system, could secure an “ almost indefinite
extension of the terms of tenancy ” might be an
evil, but as the same majority could equally
well confiscate the Herald, and hang the
editor, and put the Government in a bag with
a large millstone, and drop the whole concern
into the sea, we would be glad to know why
the affrighted organ of landlordism is so much
scared about a small danger and pays no atten-
tion to a very large one ? And lastly, it would
be interesting to learn if there ever was a sys-
tem under which either a majority, or a
minority, or anything else, couldn’t make an
ass of itself if it wanted to, either with or with-
out Land Nationalisation ; for if such a system
can be found The Bulletin is prepared to ad-
vocate it forthwith ? These questions suggest
five of the ways in which the Herald has made
a fool of itself, but there are about sixty more
which we are compelled to hold over for wane
of space.
An Inference by a Deranged Newspaper.
The Brisbane Week publishes the cold remains
of a murdered inference with regard to the
Scotch railway-strike, as follows :
The strike has hardly commenced before one of the
usual sequences of strikes presents itself—the need
of public subscriptions to carry on the work. This latter
fact points to the conclusion that a good many of the
men felt that there wag not a sufficient cause for a strike,
or that a strike was not a suitable remedy. In nearly all
these cases there is an attempt to compel men blindly
to follow their leaders—to reduce them to a state of
villeinage as complete as that of England 700 years ago.
When a crowd of men begin blacklegging
during a strike the capitalistic press always
advances the same old argument—that the
fact of blacklegs being obtainable is a suffi-
cient proof that there is no cause for dissatis-
faction on the part of Labour, and the
labourer’s lot is really all that any white man
can possibly desire. It is never, by any
chance, a proof that when men have to choose
between sixteen hours’ daily toil for 18s. or 20s.
a week, on the one hand, and utter starvation
in a frozen climate on the other, some of them
may accept the drudgery and the miserable
pittance as the smaller curse of the two—it is
rather a distinct evidence that the drudgery is
a pleasant and cheerful thing, and that the
average human being really likes it. Of course,
if the workman hangs himself as a third
alternative, that fact is not regarded as
proof that he is fond of hanging him-
self, and that he did it because he
would rather hang himself than remain un-
hanged, and that hanging is a pleasant thing
generally ; and if he goes out and brains an
employer it is no sufficient testimony that
employers ought to be brained, and that they
are really fond of the operation. When the
famished toiler accepts one method of escaping
from utter starvation he thereby demonstrates
that he has no grievances at all, and never had
any, and if he accepts either of the two other
equally rational methods he merely demon-
strates that he is a scoundrel and ought to go to
Sheol or thereabouts, but by no possible method
can he demonstrate that he is overworked and
underpaid, and the mere slave of an unfeeling
and ruffianly rich man or corporation. Also it
is a subject of complaint that he wants money
to help him in his difficulties, and though
Britain has put up countless millions for Hun-
garian rebels, and Greek insurgents, and dis-
affected Bulgarians, and inundated Chinamen,
and corpulent missionaries, it is an evidence of
utter depravity that a British workman should
want anything subscribed for him. And,
lastly, it is an unfathomable sin that he should
“blindly” follow the leaders he has himself
appointed, instead of blindly following the
employer who tells him to work for starvation
wages, or the aristocrat rulers who tell him he
must pay taxes for wars which were undertaken
a century before he was born, or the politicians
who bid him liquidate the bill for Egyptian
campaigns from which he derives no benefit.
Truly this world is full of logic—as well as of
other tinners which it is unnecessary to specify

Whatever Freemasonry may be in private
theory, it is the most lickspittling of institu-
tions in public fact. We read that the Earl of
Euston (a discredited person who nearly
died last week) opened anew Masonic
Hall at Northampton on 25th September.
After breathing his awful blessing on the
place, dear brother Grand Master Euston
opened a banquet, attended by a lot of local
Masons as well as visitors from all parts of the
world. What does Freemasonry inculcate
amongst its adherents, except a disposition to
exalt the wealthiest numbskull, or high-titled
blackguard, they can pitchfork into a position
for which, according to their own secret laws,
the said fool or “ duffer” hasn’t properly quali-
fied himself ? What is Australian Masonry, so
far as we see it in public, but an ostentatious
worship of Governors and people like Sir
William Clarke, which latter personage may
be specially instanced as mentally incapable of
“getting up” the dark Masonic lore that is
supposed to be inseparable from his high-
sounding billets ? If the careless reader—Free-
mason or otherwise —will think hard over these
matters for five minutes, he will understand
why Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and
his male relatives and pals are always so ready
to open another blessed lodge, and w iro fraternal
greetings all over the earth.
■ ♦
We have read the evidence in the case of Mrs.
Pearcey, the now notorious Hampstead (Eng.)
murderess, who killed the wife and child of her
paramour, Hogg. When she heard of Hogg’s
proposed marriage, and became aware that he
could not get out of it, she wrote, despairingly :
—“I love you with all my heart, and I love
her because she will belong to you,” and much
more in a strain which showed her to be the
victim of a hopeless and overmastering infatu-
ation. To argue that the gallows (the woman
has since been hanged) acts as a deterrent in the
case of people who are swayed by the strong
passions which obviously ruled Mrs. Pearcey
(and which rule all real murderers) is simply to
convict oneself of sheer lunacy. The only
persons in whose minds the gallows is ever a
factor are they who are too weak and irresolute
or unimpressionable ever to commit murder.
What, for instance, will be the moral deducible
from the execution of Phelan (should he be
convicted) who, in a fit of jealousy killed his
wife at Melbourne, and then nearly succeeded
in killing himself ? Will it not be simply this
—“ When you, acting under an influence which
you cannot resist, commit murder, be sure and
have a knife sharp enough to kill yourself
afterwards.” Phelan wasn’t afraid either to
kill his victim or to kill himself—he did both to
the best of his ability. Now, if hanged, he
will be hanged simply because he by a mere
accident failed to absolutely commit suicide !
They might, as logically and as beneficially,
hang his knife-grinder.

The appeal case to the Privy Council, Ah Toy
v. Musgrove, evokes some facts about that
tribunal. It is smugly referred to as an evi-
dence of Imperial Federation, the last resort of
Australasia, Canada, India, Hong Kong, and
all the British Congeries. Yet it is not binding
on the House of Lords —only on us children,
not yet out of pap. A remarkable thing about
the Privy Council is that its business is con-
ducted without any fuss or feathers. No wigs
or gowns are worn, and the sittings are in a
comparatively small room at the Downing-street
office. The arguments go on quite in a conver-
sational way, there is no “orating,” and the
Bench is down on a level with the Bar, in fact,
there is literally no Bench at all. In short,
this is the only tribunal in the glorious empire
presided over by common-sense.
The Times, speaking of the prospects in the
Soudan, remarks in a gladsome way that the
Mahdi’s power has been completely broken,
and consequently “a large market for Man-
chester goods has been opened.” It was ever
thus. England went to the Soudan to
christianise the lost heathen and civilise him,
and having got there she merely trades off the
old slop shirt with the glaring stripes on the
tail, and if the Arab won’t bUy that garment he
is shot as being in a state of insurrection. The
talk about the spread of Christianity is too
thin, for no Moslem ever yet became a
Christian ; but if the market for Manchester
goods is opened nobodv cares whether the
Arab is converted or not. But merely for the
sake of appearances the British parson rises
with a stationary glass tear on the end of his
nose, and states that a great work is in progress,
and that the seed has been sown in the beloved
brown brudder who once languished in error’s
chain, but who now cannot be seen for dust as
he spurts along the road for Zion and crashes
heavily on the shingle of the New Jerusalem.

840 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Jan. 21, 1891.
My Dear Mooraoixda,—
Lord Jersey landed at Princes’ Stairs, Sydney, ns per
advertisement, on 15th inst.* Of course all the available
great men met him on the brink of the harbour, but
owing to the fact that so many of the white-waistcoat
brigade are at present recruiting at their various country
seats, the cluster of representative persons, headed by
Premier Parkes, with most of his ordei's on, and
Mayor Burdekin in black and scarlet, did not
exactly impress one as a bi'illiant assemblage. The
One or two hired-carriage loads of M.’sL.A., for
instance, suggested a returning auction-sale crowd, and
from first to last the parade of local Majesty' out in its
best to back the Governor up was reminiscent of a third-
class “ burying ’’—minus the mutes. There Were very
few women in the cort&ge which followed H.E. to
Government Hcttse. The Bishop brought his chaperone
and the Misses Smith (all in deep black, of course), and in
another carriage was Lady Alice Shaw-Stewart (a sort of
codsin-gennan-hy-marriage to Lady J.), who also wore
black, with beaded mantelet te and a Diatronish black
-bonnet, looking in Her sombre attire like the principal
lady-motirner.
Lord Jersey is by no means unlike his portrait as pub-
lished by The Bulletin. He is a sinall and fragile gen-
tleman, with cricket-bat neck ami shoulders and noticeable
ears. He wears his damp, ginger hair combed eranewise
over his globe-shaped cerebrum ; and his Roman nose-
well, he obviously' suffers from indigestion. He wore a
seedy' blue coat, and held his three-cornered black hat
edged with fur in his hand (as he “ acknowledged ” the
strange murmurs with which the unemployed cheered
him on his course) in a way which suggested the malady
he was said to suffer from en voyage, and gave a funny
little nod from right to left. Opposite him in the carriage
sat the strawberry-blonde Earl of Ancrum, A.D.C., whose
scarlet uniform lit Up with gold cords corrected the
warmth of his personal coloring, while the Übiquitous
cyclorama-man supplied the necessary “white horse”
which everybody began to look for as the train went by.
The swearing-in ceremony at Government House, which
has been “renovated” in barber's shop style for the brand-
new vice-regality (the most noticeable changes being that
Lady Carington’s boudoir has been metamorphosed into a
billiard-room, and that a draughty Swiss chalet is in
course of erection in the West garden for the “staff” to
yarn in during business hours—thereby enlarging the
house-proper by five rooms) took place in the hall, a
number of ladies having seats on the stair-case while as
many people as could crowd into the passage formed a
neck-straining back ground in the doorway. The cere-
monies Were short and serious. Lord Jersey took his
three oaths in a nervous voice quite inaudible on the top
stair, and after Sir Alfred Stephen had introduced Mrs.
“ Seppy ” Stephen, the Misses Stephen, &c., &c., &c., to
the Earl he was allowed to escape to his private apart-
ments, and a great lull occurred until after luncheon,
when the levee came on and passed off as usual.
The suite of the Earl of Jersey really consists of two
nice young men, notwithstanding the length (on paper)
of his retinue. Mr. George J. Goschen,private secretary,
and the Hon. Rupert Leigh, A.D.C. (to whom for motives
of space ■The Bulletin will hereafter allude as Brother
Rupert No. 2) are strictly for “use,” while the gilded
Earl of Ancrum and the unphonetic Captain Cholmondeley
in their ornamental capacity as superfluous aides-de-camp
are only for “polishing.” And don’t you forget it.
At the Criterion, Miss Maud Williamson plays Brenda
Musgrave—a beagle-like charmer who is perpetually after
scalps—in a variety of frocks, the most edifying being a
black broche satin with frontal drape of jetted net, lace
elbow sleeves and regimental scarf from left shoulder to
right hip—a few red roses on the bodice to relieve the
general gloom. But Pattie Browne, as Nora Fitzgerald
(with a much more subdued Italian accent than she
favoured Melbourne with, by-the-by), absorbs all the
frocking interest. In the first acts she sports a
primrose - yellow lace striped lustre the stripes
going harrel-hoop-wise about the round skirt, bodice
of yellow guipure lace with high gigot sleeves,
pancake hat with yellow ribbons and what’s-o’clock
trimming. In 2nd act a pink silk dinner-gown with
scarves of pale-pink erfipe, the skirt and bodice trimmed
w ith gold galon. Brenda Gibson—as Lettice Vane—wears
white brochii bodice and train, the jupe made in the
window-blind style, the puffings held down by white satin
panels finished with pearl ornaments ; while Fanny Enson
resurrects pale-blue silk chiffon and silver passementerie
very effectively. In the last act Pattie wears seal-brown
cashmere with sleeves and side panel of velvet en suite,
dainty toque hat in tomato-red velvet, black jet and
blackbirds.
Apropos to the Criterion, it is most interesting to see
how trickily the only Tithe radge fools about with his
“stage-business” cigar, making believe to enjoy the
fragrant weed. I am told that Mr. Titberadge can no
more get through a Havanna than he could make the
gallery believe he is an angel—nevertheless, nobody ever
dreams that he can’t smoke.
Spurred on by a shattered tympanum, your Sappho
raises her indignant voice against the various theatrical
orchestras— especially in the smaller theatres—which are
getting less and less soothing every evening. In one
playhouse the interval harmony, provided to keep the
women from wondering how much longer James will he
out talking to Smith, sounds like a fat elephant climbing
over a quantity of gongs, and in another haunt of Thespis
the melody doesn’t softly steal over yon, as it were, but
comes with a pelt and a jump as if the musicians were
throwing it at the audience. <t.
Have you ever been struck by the oddness of the
popular scepticism in regard to the ability of an actress
to, play upon the piano-? “ She’s not playing,” is the
invariable whisper when a stage sojo is struck up, “ it’s
somebody at the wings,” though why all the musical
genius should be concentrated there, isn’t explained.
No matter how stupidly simple the tune may he, the
actress never obtains the credit of performing it—the
talented pianist “ behind ” gets all that. But, as a matter
of fact, most actresses play what is termed “a little”—
quite enough to trickle about over the ivories in the
drawing-room scene, while the jenn premier sentimen-
talizes in the centre.

There is_no rest for the sassiety person in season or out
of it, and the reason is that the sassiety person is generally
a person who cannot be left to its ow n devices, because it
hasn’t got any, and therefore it hugs its chains whether
at Potts Point or Mount Victoria, though dll the time
pettishly complaining of the very conditions it is most
anxious to preserve! Take any “furnished mountain
cottage ’’-region—like Blackhcath. Its denizens swarm
upon it avowedly for “ rest ” and “ quiet,” but they don’t
want such hUm-drum things, else why keep up a metro-
politan round of dissipation ? A lady recently abandoned
the situation in disgust and came back to town, where
matters social are quiet as the grave—and actually' bene-
fited by it. She was getting quite fagged out with
“calls” and dinner parties and dances—all the regular
season tricks in the flaming heat of January—and found
that the deserted metropolis presented more features of
absolute rest than the “tourist district” does in the
swing of the summer season. No wonder that the dis-
heartened paterfamilias gazes dismally at the sallow, run-
down faces of mamma and the girls, after he hits paid top
prices for their recuperation ! ■
I wonder whether the reason is that the average woman
cannot read the plain legend, “ Foot-passengers keep to
tlie right,” that she almost invariably stems the tide of
pedestrians on our main streets ? With her parasol at the
angle of a ship’s spar she worries up or down the wrong
side of the kerb in a series of diagonal dodges suggestive
of setting to partnei's, and the flying business-men can
never allow for her tackings being regular. For if
he goes left she trips him up with a pained expression
about her eyebrows, and if he goes right she suddenly
makes up her mind to get round him that way, and
another embarrassing block occurs. If she worried her
anti-bylaw.in a tolerably' straight line, you eould make
latitudinal allowances for her, but it is that erratic side-
tack which demoralises a whole paveinent-load of people
who have to pull up short sometimes in the shape of the
letter C to avoid sending her spinning into the gutter.
Queensland is ahead in the matter of Servants’ Unions >
One of which was inaugurated at Blackall by five Bridgets
and a chairwoman. Rates of wages were agreed upon,
and among others the flowery reg’latioh that the down-
trodden creature in the plush jacket should have every
Sunday afternoon from three to five, aftd every alternate
Sunday night from eight to ten, together with one hotir
two afternoons a week, and three evenings a w’eek from
eight to ten. Wages were treated equally lavishly by the
meeting, and if the Union doesn’t prove a fizzle the
Bananaland “ Mum ” will have to pay her housemaid I5S-
a week, her nurse-girl 125., afid her lady cook not less
than two pounds !
A very pretty wedding was that of Miss Pope, Of
“ Dapovispe,” Ashfleld, to Mr. A. A. Boyd, which took
place at Summer Hill on 14th inst. The bride looked her
nicest in white ottoman silk, trimmed with the new
flsher’s-net silk fringe, and was attended by One maid
(Miss Houghton) in white and vieux-roae silk. After the
ceremony a reception was held at “ Dapovispe ” (which
was charmingly decorated with beautiful ferns), and at
the conclusion Mr. and Mrs. Boyd left for Tasmania. The
bride’s going-away gown was a pale-grey and priinrose
delaine, with toque hat of black and gold lace and creatn
roses. On their return to Sydney the pair will issue
invitations for a large dance.
People who saw' how the Cat jumped in certain circles,
are now wondering whether an imminent eminent lady
Personage will show as much antagonism to a local she-
Magnate as did her predecessor. Some said it was the
green-eyed monster—on account, perhaps, of better gown-
ing, for jealousy generally rests on a petty basis—others
averred that it was simply the wild longing to snub which
possesses even the most charming women when confronted
by a personality hostile to them. There never was the
faintest pretence of the entente cordiale between these
ladies, and it now remains to be seen whether personal
aversion or official etiquette was at the bottom of it.
Another blush on the face of a leading Sydney daily
TTOUSEKEEPER for a bachelor, with comfortable
I L home ; state age and experience. Housekeeper,
Herald.
“ State age and experience ’’ is gdod. You can imagine
how great a chance of “ suiting ” the capable female 6f
50 with a lifetime of grovelling references, would stand
beside the interesting damsel with the gold-washed locks
and only one feeble “character ” in her own handwriting
setting forth her personal virtues on over-scented pink
note-paper. But probably “ Housekeeper” wants to be
posted in the age and experience of the coining angel so
as to avoid falling into the clutches of austere Evangelical
competency in spectacles.
Madame Weigall’s Fashion Journal for January is
principally remarkable for a bright orange-coloured cover
which was not there of yore, for the styles are the same
as they have been all summer and there is nothing from
first to last which the amateur dressmaker would feel
even the faintest thrill of pleasure in constructing. The
journal draws attention to variety in riding-apparel, and
coolly states that “linen skirts, covert coats, leather
belts, and straw sailor hats can be worn with a riding
skirt.” Of course-certainly, only the effect of a covert
coat when the wearer is going at a gallop does not soothe,
and a linen skirt filled with wind is not so graceful as a
well-fitting habit bodice, nor is it—even though Lady
Scott adopted it once or twice—considered good form on
horseback.
A crowded house—not only composed of youngsters

the evergreen blonde flossy Tottie of the front row.

“The Middleman” is a play of some
merit sociologically considered, but chiefly in-
teresting because of the dramatic power of the
central acts (the first and last acts are weak) and
its strong contrasts in characterisation. It takes
an actor of more than ordinary power to hold the
stage by himself, as does Charles Cartwright in
Cyrus Blenkarn during long scenes on lines that,
from a feebler source, would quickly weary an
audience. The actor’s impersonation of the
genius, robbed of money, fame, daughter; faint,
yet pursuing his ideal, regardless of all else, is
vivid, convincing, and one of the finest things, in
its way, Sydney has seen for a long time. Olga
Nethersole, as Mary, has a comparatively small
part, which she lifts out of insignificance by
clear enunciation, fine facial expression, and her
ability to simulate tears in the voice. Edward
Sass, as the Middleman, a character built, as the
D.T. suggests, somewhat on the lines of Consul
Bernick in Ibsen’s “Pillars of Society,” gets a
good show and makes the most of it. The Jesse
Pegg of Hans Phillips is, perhaps, the best piece
of work he has shown for a long time, anyhow, it
is a very good performance. Nellie Lyons is all
right as Nancy, and “Bill” Leake, safe as a
church, eagerly seizes on the show to air his in-
destructible white “spats” as Batty Todd. William
evidently believes in the old adage, “Keep
your head cool and your feet hot,” for
he never wears a hat by any chance at
any time, no matter where the scene is laid.
Harold Russell is effective in a minor part; so is
Alice Deorwyn and the only dialect part in the
play, old Danksj is tottered and jabbered through
in good style by Charles Westmacott. We had
nearly forgotten the Captain Chandler, a manly,
broad rendering of a small but important part,
. by Harry Jewett, who is as popular here as round
the corner. “ The Middleman ” has caught on so
well that the season has been extended from six to
eight weeks. Covernor Jersey goes there to-night
(Thursday).

A second hearing of “Harvest” discloses
many fine lines obscured by heaps of melodramatic
high falutin, and several strong situations
weakened by the tags the author has thought
necessary to put in the mouth of the heroine to
justify his selection of “Harvest” as a title.
Little Brenda Gibson is to be congratulated on the
tenderness and sweet freshness of her Lettice ; it
is her best performance up to date, though some-
what on the lines of “Sweet Lavender.” “ Dot”
Boucioault is laid up—seriously ill, in fact—with
repressed gout, and Prompter MTntyre plays
Babble Brook in an automatic fashion. By the
way, why do they offend the artistic eye and
spoil the beautiful gleh-scene by sticking gaudy,
large-bloomed flowers in the crevices of rocks
whore such flowers never grew since time was?
“ Comrades ”~a play by Brandon Thomas, pro-

When Governor Jersey visited Her
Majesty’s on Monday evening, the Damnational
Anthem, to coin a term of opprobrium, was sung
by the company. How this theatre snared Jersey
first is not known. Manager Macdonald says the
overtures came from Government House. If so,
it is to be presumed that the revered title of the
building took the vice-regal fancy. Jersey, how-
ever, wasn’t a big draw ; he didn’t fill the circle,
while the rest of the house was crammed-with
people who came to see Maggie Moore. Business
continues brisk, and with the patronage of a fresh
Governor every week it might run' till Boxing-
Night. Lacking that, “ Dick ” looks like running
for another six weeks. The Wednesday matinees
are a pronounced success.

Despite the lovely scenery, gorgeous
dresses, well-drilled marches, and the introduction
of live horses and a teal coach, “Cinderella” is
not such a big thing as was anticipated, and her
old glass slipper will be chucked out into the lane
on the 31st, with the empty porter-bottles, to
make way for the evergreen Grattan Riggs, who,
it was rumoured, would put up “Ten Drinks in a
Bar-room,” by Harry Ridout, but will play
“ Arrah-na-Pogue ” instead for six nights, fol-
lowed by “ The Irish Detective,” an entirely new
play, written, it is whispered, by Cardinal Moran
and Parnell. The Riggs season over, Bland Holt
comes along with “Master and Man,” which gives
us a show of seeing Arthur Lawrence at his best
as Humpy Logan.

The present “ Pirates of Renzance ” per-
formance, at Melbourne Princess’s, is rather
better, taking one consideration with another,
than some previous revivals of the same opera at
the same house. Neither Gilbert nor Sullivan
appears at his best in “ The Pi rales,” the story
being frequently strained in its humour, and the
music of a more old-gothic-cathedral order than
usual. Probably the funniest feature of the show
on Saturday night was the seriously “loyal”
reception of a climax in which Gilbert ridicules
loyalty. The victorious pirates fall into an osm
tatious tremble and lay down their arms when the


sergeant of police desires them, in the Queen’s
name, to surrender. After which the Pirate King
sticks the pole of the Union Jack against his
bottom rib and warbles “Rule Britannia,” whilst
an allegorical vision of that apocryphal female
bossing the deep blue sea is disclosed to view at
the back of the stage, Even W.S.G. has never
devised a broader satire than this same, yet it was
far too subtle for the dress-circle and reserved
stalls at the Princess’s. The author should have
been there—ah ! that he should—to see the salt of
the Marvellous City rising from their seats to
cheer the sentiment that “Britons never will be
slaves ” sung by a mock buccaneer who, “ with all
his faults, dearly loves his Queen.” It was touch-
and-go whether the whole evening-dressed portion
of the audience wouldn’t strike up the National
Anthem and dissolve into tears of idiotic joy.
Miss Frances Saville’s first appearance as Mabel
gave further proof that “the Firm” have found
(or, rather, brought back to the operatic stage) a
prima-donna capable of taking Nellie Stewart’s
place in characters where dash and abandon are
not essential. The new lady’s voice and appear-
ance are alike sweet and graceful, and she has a
charm of manner sufficient to carry her fairly
through the part. Her ‘ ‘ form ” all round strikes
one as being much about the same as Marion
Hood’s. Howard Yernon is the Major-General
of yore, with a little more music in his voice than
he had a year or two back, and Ryley, as com-
pared with his ponderous predecessor, Marnook,
makes a good Pirate King. Leumane has dropped
into a way of taking his breath at awkward places,
and he doesn’t pair well with the majestic Mabel,
on account of not being built that way. Miss
Elsie Cameron looms intolerably large as Ruth,
but the agreeable May Pollard still struggles to
talk like Essie Jenyns without satisfactory results,
and the Sergeant of Police gets several encores for
his song because he can’t well avoid them. With
Elton, in “ Charity Begins at Home ” as an after-
piece, the present bill should boom until
‘ lolanthe ” is ready.

Nellie Stewart’s farewell week at the
Opera House started with “ Boccaccio ” on Satur-
day, when the house was no fuller than might
have been expected. To-night (Thursday) and
to-morrow “Paul Jones” will be put up for the
last times, and then the most capable, or certainly
the most suitably-cast company that have ever
appeared in a series of light operas in Australia
vtill be broken up and done for, collectively speak-
ing. About the artistic success of the Nellie
Stewart shows there can be no two opinions.
Everything possible has been accomplished, with
words that were second-rate or behind the times,
sometimes both, and it may be taken for granted
that the fair Ellen’s “ good-bye ” —presuming she
makes a speech will be spoken to a monstrous
big audience, full of hearty good wishes that she
will make a big hit in London and then return as
soon as possible to the old folks at home. Which
we are the old folks at home.

At the Alexandra they seem to be doing
good business, considering wind and weather, with
“ The Workman,” and if the days of that ’orny
’anded toiler are not long in the land he must
attribute any abbreviation to his unfilial attitude
towards an ancient but unvenerable father. The
law of Moses takes no discount off honour due to
a parent who fills his son’s family circle with
fumes of alcohol, and stirs his tea with a red
herring, nor did the renowned Hebrew consider
how much harder it is to swear to a father than
swear at him. The Commandment stands out
distinctly against a background of bygone ages,
so the laziest old ruin that ever got drunk at his
alleged progeny’s expense can’t be put outside on
the mat with safety. John Tressider doesn’t go
quite as far as this, but he betrays symptoms of
dissatisfaction when the author of his being comes
up from the country by excursion train and loses the
return ticket, and John’s subsequent misfortunes
are doubtless owing to the fact that he wants to
let his old man roost among the rats in a back
cupboard. “The Workman” improves on ac-
quaintance. A rustic song and dance in the first
act deserve mention, and Dampier’s conception of
the miserable old sponge, well set off by a typi-
cally tough and virtuous British matron, gets
funnier every night. Miss Lily, likewise, shows
a disposition to talk in a higher key, and her
sorrow for the loss of her sawdust baby is
genuinely pathetic. But then, few young spinsters
have buried, or been separated from, so many
stage children as Lily. Kingdom Come must be
pretty nigh full of her lost little treasures.

“Dandy Dick ” has nearly run his allotted
course at the Bijou. Such altogether unique
creations as the Dean, and that weary fragment,
Ins sister-in-law, might have gone on saying good
things for another month at a more promising
time of year, but for the present they must retire
in favour of “Dr. Bill.” the recent Sydney success.
Miss Myra Kemble has not been seen in Mel-
bourne for two years, and was so rarely seen
before the last time, that she comes now with the
charm of novelty shining like a halo around her
beautiful head. This is as near to high-class

The Royal pantomime goes on the same
as ever. Some remarks in last issue; concerning
a certain style of acrobatic dancing have been
misunderstood to reflect upon the cleverness of
Franks and Marion. On the contrary, the par.
recognised the awful dexterity and hard thinking
lavished upon the performance in question, but
questioned whether it was aesthetically satisfac-
tory, or something, to the lofty souls of people
who write for papers, especially sixpenny papers.
There is nothing else in particular to say about
the pantomime, except that it is no_ business of
somebody if somebody else’s dressing-room is
loaded up with admirers, or, if it is, somebody
ought to know better. And which somebody we
jan’t say for certain.

Gpod old Kreitmayer and Phil Stuart look in

then loses flesh by taking a bolster from under his
Waistcoat. Other shows stand where they did,

Harry St. Maur holds a real good thing in
“Brighton,” the Criterion comedy which has
recently been produced at the Adelaide Royal with
more than average success. “ Brighton,” is by
Bronson Howard, we believe, and is known in
America as “ Saratoga ” ; its author, if we err not,
is Charles Wyndham’s son-in-law. Anyhow,
they’re related. It is wonderful what spicy morsels
are gobbled up and easily digested in the city of
tabernacles. The comedy affords Mr. St. Maur
ample scope to show his abilities, George Carey
shines in a character sketch of a deaf old gentle-
man, while Florence Seymour and Rosa Conroy
lend capable assistance and air the contents of an
apparently inexhaustible wardrobe, “ Queen's
Evidence ” will be turned on next. The Taylor-
Carrington Company are doing very well at
Garner’s Theatre, where “Rip Van Winkle ” is
walking round.

Even the fashionable actor is liable at
times to find a dead fly in his cup of bliss. For
instance, that too beautiful gondolier, Mr. Charles
Ryley, hasstill to escape from the theatre by devious
ways, because it has become the fashion to fall in
love with him, and, as a rule, there is a blonde
waiting to make his acquaintance—by violence, if
necessary—at the stage-door, and two brunettes
lying for him at the refreshment-room entrance;
and a gold-washed seraph at the corner with a
bouquet, who wants to state that she will be his
forevermore. And as Mr. Ryley doesn’t want
any seraph—or, at least, has no use for six of
them—he generally comes down stealthily, and
reconnoitres for a moment, and then bolts across
the street and runs for it. The other night, how-
ever, a lady fair of elevated lineage blocked him
on the stairs, and when he fled up into the re-
freshment-room she followed, and then people
were surprised to see an eminent baritone double
himself up underneath the counter just as a
female, with love shining in her eye, burst in at
the door. At times like these even the most
beautiful of gondoliers would almost rather be a
plain bald potato-dealer with a lame eye.

Writers who question the immense value
of acting experience to dramatic authors are apt
to forget that the most successful of modern play-
wrights have had some practical knowledge of
stage business before they made their names.
Boucicault was an actor in a small way, even
previous to the advent of “London Assurance.”
Tom Robertson came of theatrical people, his
sister, Madge, having been an “ infant pheno-
menon ” years before “ Society ” lifted her
brother out of poverty and obscurity. H. J.
Byron wrote several of his “fattest” easy parts
for himself, and Pinero’s first effort —a pretty
little, one-act comedy—was produced at the
Lyceum whilst he was still a member of Irving’s
company. In fact, Pinero played the leading
character, and did it uncommonly.well. Of “ un-
professional ” dramatists Charles Reade, W. S.
Gilbert, Buchanan, and G. R. Sims may be
instanced to show that whereas it takes (speaking
generally) a first-rate outsider to write a really
successful play, the actor-author can write one as
good, or better, without having any pretensions
to turn out novels, poems, Bab Ballads, or even
“Mustard and Cress” of sufficient excellence to
bring them celebrity. Sketches by Byron and
Pinero have appeared in theatrical publications,
and were found to be very colourless and soft. But
someone asks where do H. A. Jones, Henry
Hamilton and scores of others, neither actors nor
thoroughgoing journalists, come in ?

The latest thing in French dramas is an
interesting little affair which will probably be
“adapted” into English at an early date, and
passed off as something which has been festering in
the author’s intelligence ever since the days of his
infancy. The plot is simple and full of pcetry.
The hero has a wife, as he is intensely indifferent
to the lady she bestows the haggard engine which
she terras her heart upon a male friend, and they
are both found out. Then the friend and the
husband expose themselves, and catch a bad cold
apiece, through fighting a duel, and the friend
undergoes considerable damage. When he gets
out of the hospital he makes an honourable pro-
posal to the effect that a divorce shall be obtained,
in which case he is willing to marry the bone of
contention. Just here it dawns on the husband,
who has hitherto taken matters with a profound
unaffeetionate calm, that the lady must be more
attractive than he imagined, else the other man
would not be so anxious to possess her, and he
falls in love officially with his own wife on the
spot. It is presumed that they are blessed with
14 children after this, including four pairs of
twins and one red-headed infant of deficient in-
telligence, and that they live happily and die
universally respected. Also, it is generally sup-
posed that the friend falls away from the paths of
rectitude, and is ultimately found dead in a horse-
trough.

Luscombe Searelle, now on his way to
Australia, has just been elected a member of the
Savage Club, He only got in by “ the skin of
his teeth ” though, his_ name having previously
been “sent back for inquiry.” It was. alleged
against him that when he had made such a
ghastly failure with the “ Wreck of the Pinafore ”
in London a few years ago, he left his crew
stranded. Not only has this been found to be
utterly untrue, but Searelle has, as a matter of fact,
since his return from South Africa paid all his
old debts with 10 per cent, interest. The real
opposition to him at the Savage, says a Bulletin
correspondent, came from A. W. Pinero and
W. S. Gilbert, the latter of whom bears malice
on account of the Searellian travesty of “Pina-
fore,”

A recent addition to the roll of the theatrical dead is
the name of Harry Ashley, a rare good comedian in his
day. London papers seem to speak of him as having
been almost unknown prior to joining Charles Wynd-
ham’s company at the Criterion, but years before that he
had made his mark at the Adelphi, In a one-act drama
called “ Smoke’’—with Mr, and Mrs. John Billington and
Miss Furtado for colleagues—Ashley used to set the house
in a roar. And does anyone call to mind young Violet
Cameron singing “ Don’t you remember, dear old Dad?”
in the original English production of “Madame Favart,”
at the Strand Theatre ? Well, Ashley was the dear old
Dad. It was in that first run of the opera that Marius
hugged and kissed Florence St. John with an ardour
which warmed the whole house. Nothing so genuinely
amorous has been witnessed on the stage since those days,
when Florence was not yet divorced from her husband —
a second-rate baritone known as St, James—and Marius
was wooing her with the scorching fury of a sirocco in
full blast. Later on, when Marius had married his
“Sinjin” in sober earnest, the pair took the Avenue
Theatre and revived “Madame Favart”- —what a change
was there! AH the life had departed from the little
Frenchman’s stage embrace—no longer did he go for Flo.
like a famished schoolboy for a ripe, red apple, And she,
pale and apathetic, accepted her husband’s weak imita-
tion of kisses with an indifference which made the present
writer a cynic thenceforth and for ever. This, however,
has little to do with poor Harry Ashley— only “ poor” by
courtesy, because he happens to be dead.

There was much ceremony at the unveiling, or dedica-

too, with glorified speeches. One cannot help thinking of
the beautiful young Lady Sangazure, who called on an

Mrs. Agnes Robertson Boucioault’s character of her
husband, in the Weekly Scotsman, is so lustrous and
enthusiastic that one can only wonder they ever had a
vestige of quarrel—De Mortuis, &c., with woman’s logic
all over, God bless her ! Bouoicault, under Lardner’s
auspices, began as an engineer, and forwarded such a
clever scheme for London drainage that he would have
got a good billet had he not been so young, and the world
would never have seen the “Colleen Bawn.” One of the
brewer Guinness’s, a relative, adopted him, and sent him
to study, but he only studied little suppers, wherefore he
was cut off even shillingless. So gentle he was, and kind,
says good Mrs. Boucicault. She is still the Fairy Star, as
they used to call her in the States.
Every old actor can write- one good chapter of reminis-

Nellie Stewart has been confiding in a Melbourne inter-
viewer. Father and mother, like most professionals,
were at first all against her going on the stage, but she
wouldn’t win the first prizes at school unless allowed to
play Prince Prettipet in the Pantomime, or something
like that. On- her last trip to England pa and raa would

In Westland Marston’s new theatrical memoirs there is
a passage about Adelaide Neilson. She married Mr. Lee,
a clergyman’s son, and the young actress went to the
parson’s house, where she was entertained better than
Miss Fortescue was by Lord and Lady Cairns. There is a
touching church anefstage guild picture, of Miss Neilson
the centre of a circle of parsons, at Mr. Lee’s, looking at
her as if she were a curious insect. So she was. She lay
some hours unrecognised in the Paris Morgue, after
which there was a squabble by a lot of bullies for her

Charles Kean had an appetite for praise scarcely
equalled even amid actors, which is saying a lot, and you

Kean’s dressing-room and gave him an enthusiastic
eulogy of his wife’s acting in the piece. Kean then
opened his mouth wide for something about himself,
but says Lovell, “ I never praise people to their faces.”
“Oh,” say’s Kean, “my dear fellow, my wife is in the
manager’s'room. Go and give her a full account.”

Eeohter’s “ Hamlet” was largely prompted by J. C. M.
Bellow, Kyrle’s father, who showed every evidence of sin-
cerity when he gave up a snug income of £lOOO a year in
the Church of England to begin life again, rather up in
years, as a Roman Catholic, the religion of his mother all
through her life. His proper name was Higgin, not
Higgins, but he took his wife’s name on account of her
high Irish lineage, whereas he had none. (Begorra, they
do have lineyages in Oireland.) The magnificent (elder)

Birchall, the Canadian murderer, left a fragment of
autobiography, composed w'hile actually waiting for his
execution, .yet it abounds in comic touches, as, for
example, his account of being connected with Richard-
son’s show, when a party of actors, all cockneys, were
doing “ Richard 111./’ and the messenger made a mistake,
jumbling Richard’s speech with his own, thus: “Me
Lord, Buckingham is took, and we off with ’is ’ead,” to
which King Dick replied, “’Ave yer? Then we’ll ’ave to
begin the ’ole bloomin’ show again, Come outside.

According to latest London advices, Harry Payne was

The spectacle of a grey-headed man fooling with sawdust

This is news. The Pall Mall Gazette seriously says
“Mr. Parnell is well-known in Australia as a dramatic
author. For more than five years a play, entitled
‘Shamrock Green: By Charles Stewart Parnell, Esq.,
M.P.,’ has enjoyed prodigious favour amongst provincial
audiences in the colonies. The lucky exclusive proprietor
of this piece boasts of having already netted £5OOO by it.
Its proprietor— an Irishman, by the way—has never yet
ventured to produce it in Melbourne or Sydney, doubtless
from a shrewd suspicion that the dramatic critics of these
capitals would want to know something more about its
history and antecedents than the bald announcement on
the playbills that ‘ Mr. Parnell wrote this play when a
young man at college.’ Provincial pressmen are not so
unpleasantly sceptical, and the Irish men and women of
the interior towns consider it a patriotic duty to roll up
in their hundreds to see ‘ Mr. Parnell’s play.’ ”
We mentioned the comic murder by the gentleman
described in newspaper language as “ the late eccentric
Duke of Brunswick,” when he ran his sword through the
body of atheatrical prompterfor ringingup the curtain and
showing the audience his Grace embracing 1 his favourite
actress. The London Satirist hinted that his Grace was
the murderer of Eliza Greenwood, an unfortunate woman
found in her bed in London with her throat out, and the
consequence was that when the Satirist editor appeared
on the stage as an amateur actor the Duke hired a lot of
bravos to hiss him, but the accusation appears to have
been wholly unfounded—a dog gets such a bad name.
One of the London actresses is distressed because she
found herself making histrionic studies at the deathbed of
her mother. Miss Achurch has been heard to express a
similar feeling of disgust with herself for involuntarily
making capital of a relative’s illness. It is like Jubilee,
the retired pawnbroker, helping a lady with her opera-
cloak at a fash’n’ble evening party—says he: “ How much
on this?”
Mrs. Agnes Robertson-Boucicault, the famous drama-

Dion was a regular Dumas in his carelessness about
money, speculating more than spending, and appeared
to require the excitement of an everlasting Monte

reckoned himself a Roman Catholic at last, though his

believed in a God, and had a remarkably intimate know-
ledge of the Bible.
It is settled, on the authority of Mrs. Potter, Sara
Bernhardt, and Mrs. Langtry, that Cleopatra wore a
gorgeous teapot on her head, with the spout forward, em-
blematic of Isis, Osiris, and Horus. But for the real
acting of Cleopatra, you have to go back to Miss Glynn,
whose Antony, Henry Lorraine, takes a humble part in
Mrs. Langtry’s Cleopatra. Bet you he goes up to her,
with tears in his eyes, grasps both her hands, and says,
“ Madam, you have shattered my idol! ” Whereupon she
stands a pint. Old Jack Ryder, Macready’s associate, did
this to Edwin Booth, in London, over Richelieu.
That shapely young soubrette, Sophie Harris, now resid-

tram tickets, three postage stamps, silver nail-cleaner,
gold ring, stud, key, compass, 205., and a purse. Sophie
never stirred a toe-nail while they rummaged her duds,
but when they started to break open the Willards’boxes in
an adjoining room she softly cleared out for assistance*
and following the burglars in a cab had them arrested.
Sophie, who is real grit, says she wasn’t afeard. But we
notice it changed the colour of her hair.

Nigger-driving in
Queensland.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Apropos to the system of “ hiring ”
kanakas to slave* for a term of years among
the sugar-canes of the tropical Korth, which
system came to an end by law on the last
day of the year that lias just closed, it may be
interesting to recount a few experiences. In
the year 1884, when the Queensland sugar-
industry was booming, I acted as chief
nigger-driver at Fairdale plantation, just below
the tropics. Fairdale was owned by a firm who
had made money during a long career of sheep-
farming in Victoria, and who, after much pro-
specting for land—sugar-lands at that period were
bringing fabulous prices—had purchased between
400 and 500 acres of sour open forest country
below flood-mark on the banks of the.Kooralin
River. Here by the moisture of the land and
extensive processes of manuring, they hoped in
time to reapagolden harvest through the medium
of the waving cane.
* * *
At the time of my advent to Fairdale the
plantation was in a fairly ship-shape condition.
The first crop of cane was rapidly maturing, and
the erection of a £60,000 manufacturing mill, em-
bracing all the latest devices, had just been com-
pleted. A large number of kanakas were already
on the spot, and 100 more were exacted to arrive
within a fortnight. Accordingly the haste and
bustle of preparation were everywhere apparent,
and the commencement of the crushing was fixed
for that day month.
Fairdale had five kanaka-overseers, of whom I
was chief. That is to say, I had the privilege
accorded me—over and above the wage emolument
of 255. per week—of living at the house, whereas
the other four had to “pig it,” together with 50
or 60 white labourers, horse-drivers, and what not,
in barracks which stood behind the mill, where
their bodily wants were supplied by a Chinese
cook and his half-dozen dusky satellites. The
only overseer of the bunch, myself included, who
presented any striking characteristics, was an
enormous Irishman named M‘Groarty, the field
overseer. His leading feature was brutality to
his black charges—brutality of the most wanton
and awful description. He wovdd kick a “boy”
if he did what he was told, he would kick him if
he didn t; he would kick or strike him with a
heavy horse-whip, whether he turned up early or
whether he turned up late. M'Groarty was cer-
tainly a wicked man with a heart as remorseless
and cruel as that of the arch-fiend, just the man
for a Bible-reading “Rescue” expedition into
Central Africa. But he got the work done.
* * #
Fairdale plantation represented a capital
investment of £lOO,OOO, which was expected to
yield an annual interest—inclusive of the risk and
personal labour of the partners—of 10 per cent.
The brothers Oldfield were what the world calls
good men, and two of them were Christians of the
most bigoted type, as were the two ladies who
presided over their household—all of them, how-
ever, were determined to make that interest.
And they would have done it, too, had sugar
stood firm at £36 per ton.
Whentheslave-ship, or rather “labour”schooner,
as she was facetiously termed in those parts,
arrived at the township with the extra hundred
“boys,” I was deputed to go into town and
receive and take them out to the plantation. I
found the ship moored in midstream, opposite the
Custom-house, and had no difficulty in getting
one of her boats to come and take me off. The
vessel was a long, low, rakish-looking schooner,
painted white with an encircling black riband—
the insignia of the Queensland slave—by courtesy,
Pacific Island labour-trade. On the quarter-deck
were grouped the captain, mate, and Government
agent, all drunk. The latter official is the one
tribute to humanity in connection with the trade
conceded by the Government—he accompanies
the ship to see after the black man’s interest. All
other interests are those of the indenting sugar-
planter, which are naturally against the unhappy
immigrant. But then the planter’s rum often
casts a glamour over the Government agent; this
one, I was told, had been drunk throughout the
voyage. And he looked it.
All the sober white people visible on board
the schooner were three local sugar-planters, the
Polynesian Inspector (a local Government official),
and myself, but there were 376 sober immigrants on
board the ship, all looking forward with the most
sanguine_hopes to the fame and fortune they were
sure awaited them in this new country. It was
easily evident from their demeanour that they had
longed for years for an opportunity to come, and
that they would at any time during their sojourn
in their native homes have bartered their best
wives and very choicest pigs for passages to
Queensland. The drafting of the labourers soon
began, and I found to my astonishment I was not
allowed to select the “ boys ” I wanted, but had,
according to law, to take a fair run of the herd,
after the manner of sheep-drafting. This, I may
explain, is a system which confers on each planta-
tion its fair proportion of the halt, the maimed,
and the blind who are regularly brought over in
these ships, and who never do a' day’s work from
the day they arrive to the day they depart, and
who not infrequently die soonafter'their arrival.
You sse, between the anxiety of the Islanders to
come, and the anxiety of the ship-master and
crew (under the “lay” or premium system) to
bring them, a large portion of the kanakas brought
over to Queensland are so diseased and maimed as
to be utterly unable to work. Well, after half-a-
day’s haggling with the Polynesian Insoector, and
the other local planters interested hi the ship-
ment, I got away to Fairdale in the evening witli
a hundred head, including men, women and
children. There were then some 270 dusky
labourers on the estate. A fortnight later, the
crushing began.
* # #
Ihe first few weeks of the crushing gave
M‘Groarty ample opportunity to exercise his
abilities in breaking in the recruits and he em-
ployed those abilities without stint. Being myself
in charge of the mill I saw very little of what
went on in the field, but heard everything. Three
kanakas, brutally injured by the fist and foot of
this modern Degree, were conveyed into the town
hospital during the first month of the crushing,
and three times M'Groarty appeared before the
local police-court charged, at the instance of the
Polynesian inspector, with occasioning actual
bodily harm to the “boys.” On each occasion he
was fined £5 and costs (the total sum being paid
by his employers), and the latter were notified by
the inspector, that on the next repetition of the
the offence he should insist on M'Groarty’s dis-
missal ; and that disregarded, would not allow
them to have any more labour from the islands.
The next offence was not long in coming and
M'Groarty had perforce to be parted with, not,
however, without many expressions of regret on the
part of his employers and a valedictory cheque for
£5O. I had almost forgotten to mention that on
Sunday the whole of the “ boys ” were sedulously
instructed in the Bible by the ladies of the home-
stead and one of the more piously-inclined of the
brothers. This, doubtless, was the ameliorating
influence which gave them fortitude to bear their
burdens during the week.
At length the fourth month of the crushing was
reached. The success of the manufacturing had
been phenomenal. Fairdale “firsts,” although
raw sugars, stood higher in the Southern markets
than any of the best refined. It was November,
and the mill was working double shifts in a vain
endeavour to get through before Christmas. The
summer heat was intense. The clouds of steam
laden with the fumes of boiling molasses which

polluted the air around the mill day and night,
were now supplemented by the ascending vapours
from thousands of tons of the rotting megass
which had been deposited in stacks all round the
mill, between the huts, and far out into the field.
There was no time to remove the waste products ;
every minute was needed to make sugar. And
so the cane, after it passed through the masti-
cating process of manufacture, was stacked here
and there in long, low ridges of decaying vegeta-
tion.
• * *
About the beginning of December a
“boy” was taken very ill. The overseer, ever
incredulous, beat him to his work that morning,
but the lad, with true nigger obstinacy, crawled
back to the hut and—died within twelve hours.
The same performance was repeated by individual
“ boys ”on the next day, and the next, and the
next, until, on the fifth day, when the morning
bell rang at 5.30 there were 25 “boys” short.
Things were getting serious ; the bosses must be
consulted. Accordingly, a conference took place
between Messrs. Oldfield and the overseers*
Efforts made to get the “boys’’out one by one
proved all in vain ; and so a messenger was sent to
town for a doctor. Dr. Staaffe was out when
the messenger arrived, but his servant promised
that he would come to Fairdale early in the after-
noon. He did so. He reached the mill at 4.30, but
seventeen of his intended patients had already
passed beyond his reach. He pronounced the
malady to be a complication of jungle and
malarial fever of the most virulent character, and
recommended that a hospital be fixed up, and that
the services of a medical man be permanently
secured. This was done, and the crushing
went on. The trucks which ran in the cane
ran out the dead bodies of the kanakas to
be buried in the trenches in the fields. Fif-
teen white men also died, but were interred
a little more in accordance with the forms of
orthodoxy. On 17th December the 270 coloured
labourers on the plantation had dwindled down to
' 90, and the mill was hung up for want of labour.
Rain was also pouring down steadily, day after
day, and it was evident that the wet season had
set in. I had fifteen pounds to draw, and deter-
mined to leave for the South.
* * *
Last February I revisited Fairdale and
ascertained that the Messrs. Oldfield were still
there. They had settled down to a steady,
bucolic kind of life; sugar had fallen the year
after they started, and they soon learnt that
it was not possible to sweat the interest of
the usurer out of the flesh and blood of the South
Set Islander. They had accordingly determined
to cut up the land into lots, and to let it
on easy terms to white men, who, with the labour
of their families and the aid of the improved
mechanical appliances now available, would grow
the cane. The proprietors would purchase and
manfacture it. This the Messrs. Oldfield assured
me was the only reasonable and only possible
solution of the black-labour difficulty.

Tail-end of a burst of loyalty from the
Melbourne D.T. :
Meanwhile, it may be as well to remark that if General
Booth does select Australia, with its millions of acres of
waste land, its need of population, and its ability to sup-
port them, as a theatre for his colonising scheme, not Mr.
Munro nor all the Australian Premiers and Parliaments
combined could prevent him from carrying out the inten-
tion. We may legislate for the exclusion of the Chinese
and convicts, but we cannot, even if we would, debar an
Englishman from settling on any portion of the British
Empire to which he chooses to travel.
Perhaps not. But, in reply, The Bulletin begs
to suggest that Sappho Smith, and the young
man who keeps the books downstairs, and the
gentleman who pays the salaries on Saturday, are
willing to unite at a crisis, and guarantee that, by
their joint efforts, at least one Englishman will
settle in Australia with considerable difficulty.
And if the other inhabitants of the country will
tackle the problem in the same spirit, the first
million Salvation converts will quit this portion
of the British Empire with unreasoning haste,
whether they are “debarred” by legislation or
■ not. The Bulletin has no precedent to offer,
-but it has an indignant lady with an umbrella,
which is worth a lot more than any precedent;
also, it is fitted with a keen sense of the undesir-
ableness of allowing a lot of square-shouldered,
scrofulous-complexioned, hollow-chested English
workhouse wrecks to come and spit the bacillus
tuberculosis all over our island.

Ask Yourself.
Ask yourself these questions: In what con-
dition am I to-day? Am I perfectly sound in
body and in mind ? Am I strong and vigorous,
and is life a constant pleasure to me ? If you can
answer these questions affirmatively you are in-
deed lucky. If you cannot, you need assistance.
If you are tired, weak, weary, or despondent, you
need assistance. The trying time of the year is
approaching with its dangers to physical health.
Do not neglect a headache ; it is a sign that your
liver is deranged, and may lead to permanent
disease if not attended to. If you are troubled
with restless nights, neuralgia, indigestion, ner-
vousness, or constipation, don’t treat such positive
symptoms of approaching physical decline with
contempt, or bitterly will you rue your careless-
ness. Such invidious foes are more dangerous and
fatal than all the wars and famines that ever
eventuated, Mr. Charles Schott, of 94, King-
street, Newtown, N.S.W., writes as under, date
July 23rd : —“ I have much pleasure in testifying
to the efficiency of Clements Tonic in curing me
of congestion of the liver. For seven years I have
suffered from constant enlargement of the liver,
which caused me severe pain, and was due to a
sedentary life and want of exercise, my life being
almost insupportable. I was listless and irritable,
and at times had to consult doctors, and was at
one time laid on a sick bed ; but all to no purpose.
Suffering in this way for many years, I resorted
to the use of Clements Tonic, and after the use of
three bottles the swelling of the liver was reduced,
and with its use pain disappeared. After taking
five bottles I can now eat and drink anything,
and smoke my pipe without that continual irritable
and sleepy feeling resulting. I trust this letter
will lead similar sufferers to the use of Clements
Tonic, giving it a fair trial, not merely using one
bottle, and then discarding it, and I am satisfied
they will derive the same benefit.” Mr. James
Prentice, proprietor of the Newtown (N.S.W.)
Chronicle, has for some time been a most acute
sufferer from liver complaint, lassitude, indiges-
tion, &c., due to business care and close applica-
tion to work. He took Clements . Tonic —For
some time I have suffered considerably from lassi-
tude and indigestion, resulting from close atten-
tion to work. To obtain relief I tried all sorts of
so-called “cures,” but found none that gave me
any ease. I was at last induced to use Clements
Tonic, and having done so, regret not having
taken it sooner. After taking only two bottles
my lassitude vanished. I was able to attend to
my duties with my usual energy, and also to relish
my food and enjoy my rest, in a way that had
been unknown for some time. I shall always
recommend Clements Tonic, believing that it
only requires to be tried to be appreciated.

But one political appointment has been
made to the N.S.W. minor bench —that of Ex-
Solicitor-General Josephson, who, however, re-
signed the appointment ere pensions to minor
judges came about. But then the ex-judge is so
disgustingly rich that he can do without a
pension,
Mrs. Throshy, of Throsby Park, one of
the oldest natives of N.S.W., died last week,
aged 84. In 1824, when she was a girl of 17, she
married Mr. Charles Throsby at the Church of
St. Luke, Liverpool, N.S.W. She was the
daughter of Comissary Broughton, an old-time
Imperial official.

The widow of Richard Anthony Proctor is

It is recorded that J. E. Salomons, Q.C,j
sold his little library of choice books to raise
funds to take hiin to England in order to be
called to the Bar. Good prices were given, chiefly
by people who admired the little man’s pluck.
Premier Playford, of S.A., could have had
a knighthood, had he chosen, in the last batch,
but recent remarks by him in the local Assembly
about “ titles ” settled his claims. He appears to
regret that he had not a formal chance to refuse.
The story is again going the rounds
concerning the alleged marriage of the Prince Im-

Bachelor Jimmy Tyson, Australia’s most

One of the things which Stanley does not

Federal who didn’t go into any battle at all.
General Booth will visit Australia in Sep-
tember to expound his emigration scheme. The
Bulletin has not yet quite made up its mind
about that energetic individual, whom it is at all
times inclined to view with the suspicion which
inevitably attaches in the mind of the unregener-
ate to all great self-advertisers, including Phmeas
T. Barnum, Brigand Stanley, &c.
The only native Australian -and locally-
educated scholar on whom Sydney University has
yet conferred a professorship is the accomplished
Mr. Thomas Butler, the late Professor Badham s
favourite pupil, who takes up in April the chan
of Latin, to which is attached about £llOO yearly.
Yet someone once said that, apart from drink, a
classical education was the only certain road to

Rochefort had spoken disparagingly of
Sara Bernhardt,whose (illegitimate) son, Maurice,
called and demanded retractation or reparation.
“My dear young man,” said Rochefort, cool as a
cucumber, ‘‘ I can’t fight you, yon know. ” “Yen
can’t fight me, sir! What do you mean?
“Why,” rejoined Rochefort, “for all we
know I might be your papa.” This story has
vaguely floated round for years, but having been
fathered it acquires new interest.
POLITICAL
POINTS.
There is a whisper that it is in contempla
tion to propose a retiring allowance to Sir Sam
Samuel, the N.S.W. Agent-General.
What has become of Parkes’ proposed
Australian Council, meeting in London, members
of which were to be elected by the Australian
legislatures ?
How is it that N.S.W. Minister of Justice
Gould denies the release from gaol of two women
whose release has been officially announced in the
Police Gazette?
The West Australian “ Six Families ” and
their friends are happy. Four out of the five
Ministers in the new Cabinet are-leading members
of that promising organisation. A Civil Service
Commission is not to be thought of under the cir-
cumstances.
South Australia recently appointed a Com-
mission to inquire into the best means of bringing
about Intercolonial Freetrade. It has just recom-
mended that the best way is by assimilating the
S.A. tariff with that of Victoria! Comment
would be cruel.
Rev. E. Griffith (Sir Samuel’s papa), of
Brisbane, is doing the advance-agent for General
Booth’s emigration show. “ The change of
heart” which the Yankee reformer will effect,
the rev. gentleman thinks, will render the London
unwashed the most desirable of colonists.
Why should Secretary Blaine, United
States, resent the reference of the Fisheries Ques-
tion to the legal tribunals of his own country ?
Can it be felt, as it was in Victoria over the Land
Act, that the Supreme Court cannot be trusted ?
All the Victorian land legislation was explicitly
defended by legislation against the Judges, with
an eye to Chief Justice Stawell’s enmity to the
people.
It is cabled that “the first batch of Jews
who are emigrating from Russia, in consequence
of persecution, have arrived in London to
fasten on the throats of the sweated London
tailors, and so on. Then the sweated London
tailors will, after being spiritually regenerated, be
transported to Australia by General Booth,
leaving room in England for another “batch” of
Russian Jews.
Says “ J.C.C.” in the Sydney Quarterly S
“Property is sacred say some, but so is Labour)
so is Poverty. All is sacred that is really human)
for all that is truly human has been drawn into
unity with God.” Now, poverty is not human, it
is clearly inhuman ; property ceases to be sacred
when it conflicts with what is human, has no
rights only duties, and is, broadly speaking, the
parent of the other inhumanity, poverty.
Now that black labour is at an end, the
Queensland “ cullud ” journals have turned to
the cheap continental article. This isn’t even
according to the law. of expediency, as the accom-
plished doom of the kanaka gave them a splendid
chance to “back down” decently and turn to
better ways. When cheap and nastly continental
labour fails, as it is bound to do, the journals that
pervert public opinion and hamper the progress
of the nation will assuredly fail too.
The German Emperor on school reform •
If the schools had done what they ought they should
have taken up the cudgels against Social Democracy of
their own accord, and the teachers should have so
brought up the rising generation-my contemporaries-
that they would have furnished me with material to work
with in the State in order to master the movement more
speedily.
As the Pall Mall puts it, he evidently considers
the nation merely an armed camp, and the school-
master a primary drill-sergeant.
In the House of Commons, Mr, Jennings
asked, from the Conservative benches ; “ Why
the Duke of St. Albans continued to receive
allowances for providing falconers and hawks and
pigeons, when, as a matter of fact, there arc
neither pigeons to feed the hawks nor falconers to
fly the hawks, nor hawks to be flown ? Charles
11. was a sanguine man,” said he, “but he never
dreamt that in the year 1890 the people of Eng-
land would still be paying £2OOO a year to the
descendants of Nell Gwynne.”
The Queensland Government has exempted
some 800 persons in minor positions from the
operation of the Superannuation Clauses of the
Civil Service Act, and these will have their con-
tribution money returned them with interest.
Which should be a hint to the N.S.W. Govern-
ment to return to its female public-sohool teachers
the four per cent, deducted from their earnings,
for not one woman in a hundred ever stays long
enough in the service to reach a pension. The
deduction of the percentage under these circum-
stances is a cruel and shameless robbery.
Just figure a career for the child-Queen of
the Netherlands somewhat based on that of such
beautiful Queens as Isabella and Christina in
Spain. Such ladies must have on hand a bully of
an O’Donnell, Narvaez, Espartero, or Serrano, for
they are like Catherine of Russia, except that
their brains are not to be found where looked for.
Consider the position of the present Regent Queen
of Spain, with a lot of fighting-cocks fluttering
round, trying to ensnare her. In Courts they
ignore human nature, which, driven out of the
palace door, comes in at the Erench window.
It is said that in the event of a general
election Parnell would return with 50 seats while
the seceders would have 25. The worst feature
of the disruption, for Home Rule, is that nearly
all the best men have left Parnell. Sexton, one
of the greatest orators living; Healy, the
organiser; Arthur O’Connor, a man who knows
more of Parliamentary practice than perhaps any
other man in the House ; “T. P.,” the best Irish
platform speaker; O’Brien and Dillon, the two
most popular of the Irish representatives; and
Justin McCarthy, a man of great literary attain-
ments and irreproachable character.
Dear Bulletin, —Parnell was unfortunate
in the selection of his candidate for the recent
Kilkenny election. Mr. Vincent Scully is one of
a family whose acts as Irish landlords have caused
as much cruelty and bloodshed as those of any
other. The Irish farmer will never forget Billie
Scully and Ballycooke, and the name of Scully is
never mentioned in an Irish farmstead without an
execration. The candidate selected to fight
Davitt, Healy, McCarthy, Sullivan and Sexton
is a very poor specimen of a man or a speaker,
and no influence could have induced the Kilkenny
farmers to be very enthusiastic in their support
of a Scully.— Kilkenny.
Victoria lias again lowered her inter-
colonial and foreign import and export returns for
the year, and is steadily concentrating her atten-
tion upon domestic self-support. Eor the year end-
ing 1890 the total Customs returns are £1,000,000
less than for the previous 12 months, and this ten-
dency towards decrease has occurred almost un-
interruptedly since 1874. The excess' of imports
oyer exports has increased by a couple of millions
since 1889. This, however, is attributable to the
abnormal purchases made by Victorians since the
late Exhibition of European and American
machinery, and in no wise represents a drifting
towards a suicidal Freetrade policy.
Stafford Brothers, Brundamba Colliery
(Q.), have had a row with the local miners’ union,
to which they have just issued this ultimatum
We have no further desire to arbitrate with you, since
it is hopeless to expect that anything like a permanent
conciliation can ever take place between a section of our
present workmen and ourselves. We shall shortly have
to part company from these. We shall endeavour to carry
on our mine in our own way, without seeking guidance
from you or appealing to arbitration, and if we are pre-
vented from so doing we propose just to sit quietly down
and do nothing.
This will be all very well provided the State
doesn’t place on all coal-mines a tax which will
make them too hot to hold unless in full work.
Once more they are going to keep green
the memory of “Convict Day.” In the name of
all that is Australian, why cannot they select
some more fitting day to celebrate the birth of
Australia as a white man’s country? Why do
they not select the April morning on which James
Cook first cast eyes on our shores ?—a worthy
man and a worthy event. Or even the January
day when Dampier first saw and cursed the
country ? Cook’s discovery had much more to do
with the colonisation of Australia than Phillip’s
settlement—and certainly is much more worthy
of celebration. However, some day Australia
will have a Fourth of July to orate on.
The 35-million French loan has been ten-
dered for many times ovei-, thus showing the
stability of the Republic. We are close on the
centenary of Mirabeau’s death, which loosened
Robespierre. The Revolution marches on, Robe-
spierre and Co. only affording the first volcanic
detonations of Vesuvius, The newest “Encyclo-
pedia Britannica ” will show you how, he, Danton,
and even Marat have been libelled. Why, don’t
you know that Fonseca, of Brazil, is a cannibal in
private, eating children ? The Republic has been
grounded on the rock ever since Louis XVI. was
guillotined. Monarchism, it is as plain as the
nose on the face of a six-bottle man, is dying out
—ebbing away.

Sydney has got its New Governor, but has
not yet had time to make up its mind about him-
He is not handsome, but then, “handsome is a?
handsome does ” —he has plenty of money, and if
he only spends it in real earnest and manages to
get his donations advertised as Baron Carington
used to do, Australia will arise as one man and
call him blessed.
# * #
In appearance Lord Jersey is a regular
brick, especially about the hair. He is a “slum-
mocky ” potentate, but, then, he looks as if he
had a sense of humour. After the dapper beauty
of Baron Mount Rennie, Jersey’s appearance is
at first blush rather depressing, When we first
gazed upon him it occurred to us that the incar-
nation of the bacillus tuberculosis, finding Europe
too hot for it, had escaped to a Colonial Governor-
ship and £7OOO a year.
* « •
The new Governor’s public welcome was
comparatively cold. But that was in no small
degree owing to the fact that he came without his
wife, who, when she arrives, will get a reception
of her own. Lady Jersey is not so dainty and
doll-like as Lady Carington, but has a most
attractively intelligent face, which will go far to
redeem her lard’s abject failure as a professional
beauty.
# # #
In Lillie Langtry’s lovely face
The “ Jersey Lily ” has its place,
And strange to say the “Jersey rose”
Asserts itself in ——.
Every man who fills in the two words we have
left out may consider himself entitled to our best
blessing—an article which usually we do not dis-
pose of under two-and-six spot cash.
*, * #
The arrival of Governor Jersey may be
expected to bring quite a number of people into
fashion whose physical peculiarities have caused
them, hitherto, to be looked on with dislike by
the ladies and with suspicion by the members of
the temperance societies.
* # *
The question arises—will Lady Jersey,
when she comes, grant a social amnesty, or will
she adhere strictly to the lines laid down by Lady
Carington? The Bulletin doesn’t quite see why
the trouble should be kept up for ever.
# * #
Some wicked newspaper-man played off a
cruel joke upon Mr. Crick, M.L.A., who it was
alleged in print was among the M.P.’s who
attended at Government House, Sydney, to re-
ceive Governor Jersey. Whereupon Paddy wrote
the S.M. Herald explaining that he was not at
Government House to receive the Governor, nor
was he presented to His Excellency.
# # #
And what a cruel rascal was the caitjffwho
traded off this in the Society column of Sydney
D.T. :
A large number of ladies viewed the procession and
arrival of the Governor on Thursday, the points of van-
tage being the upper windows and balconies of the Lands
Office and Colonial Secretary’s buildings. Lady Parkes
and a party of friends were noticed as holding a good
position for a look-out on the arrival of-the vice-regal
party and the procession as it defiled through the gates
and down the tree-lined road to Government House.
At the foot of the big stairs in Government House
when the new Governor arrived, there sat about
a dozen ladies, including no less than eight mem-
bers of the inevitable Stephen family, Mrs. Carl
Fischer, and the wives of a couple of military
officers.
# # #
Undoubtedly the handsomest equipage at
Gov. Jersey’s levee was that of Mr. Carrie Swain*
# # #
In the welcome to Governor Jersey the
N.S.W. Primrose League was conspicuous by its
absence. Has ridicule killed the tribe of fops?
Or, is the League saving itself for the arrival of
Dame Jersey ?
# # #
The Adelaide Natives have decided to
substitute “Our Native Land” for the toast
“The land we live in” at all future meetings.
They have, however, decided to stick to the toast
of “The Queen,” and the yelling of the National
Anathema is as powerful as ever.
# * ■#
If The Bulletin had its way—which it
will one of these days—it would on taking
the chair at a public gathering, try to settle the
Royalty question at one fell swoop, thus: —
“ Gentlemen, we see around us at this board the
citizens of many nations over whom monarchs
rule and have ruled. We therefore ask you to
drink to the health of all living monarchs and to
the memory of all dead ones ; also to the healths
and memories of all their respective wives, hus-
bands, mistresses and children, legitimate and
illegitimate.” Such a toast would be fair and
comprehensive, and would give pleasure to all.
« * *
The cableman perpetrated a little joke on
Gov. Hopetoun a week or two ago. He cabled
that Lady Hopetoun had undergone a painful
operation, and was now improving, and also that
Lady Kintore was doing well in London. Hopey
was flabbergasted and, being a Scotchman, didn’t
see the joke. He wired to know what the
opei’ation was about, and learned to his relief
that not only had there been no operation per-
formed, but the idea had not even been
suggested. The good-natured cable-fiend (who
had all along only wanted to help the Goy. in
explaining the departure of her ladyship) didn’t
mind this rebuff in the least, but went on his way
smiling, and a week later calmly and unblushingly
wired that Lady Kintore had arrived in the old
country.

There is a great row over the opening day
of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Melbourne, being re-
stricted to subscribers of £25 apiece, and certain
it is that nobody out of the Evangelists, or Acts
of the Apostles, would have got in. The poor ye
have always with you—and they are a confounded
nuisance. We knew a journalist (not a clergy-
man) who said, “D the horny-handed !” The
clergy don’t say so—exactly.)
A FINE OLD CHESTNUT!
Mabel (meditatively) : “So our new Governor has red hair, ugh?”
MAMMA ( diplomatically): “Golden, my dear, golden!”
MABEL [demurely) : “Oh, of course, eighteen -carat to be sure, no less!”
Canon Barlow, of Toowoomba, who was
recently elected to the Bishopric of North Queens-
land, is" said to have been severely exercised in his
mind as to whether he would accept the billet or
not. The sphere of labour thus opened to him is
considerable, in fact, immense, and the Canon is
a modest man. The income is in inverse ratio to
the labour, and the Canon is a thrifty man. How-
ever, it is believed that the leggings and the title
carried the day.

Roberts, of the Dunedin Exhibition, has
been offered a C.M.G.-ship, and thinks of de-
clining it, as he fully expected to be K.C.M.G. It
would be very regretable if Roberts should per-
sist in his unseemly determination. Consider the
feelings of her Most Gracious Majesty, Roberts,
and take it—it will help to meet butchers’ bills.
Start a brewery, and then if you don’t come out
on the XXX list, console yourself with the
reflection that the resurrection is not far ahead
and then stars will be a drug in the market.

The fashionable Mrs. Maybriek killed her
victim, her husband, from motives similar to
those which actuated the latest sensational
English murderess, Mrs. Pearcey—she wished
to rid herself of an obstacle to the complete grati-
fication of her unholy passion. But Mrs. May-
brick’s crime was far worse than that of Mrs.
Pearcey, for while the latter slew her victim right
away, possibly in a fit of ungovernable rage arising
out of some dispute which she may have had
with Mrs. Hogg (it may .be noted that
Pearcey was an unquestionable epileptic, the
history of attacks from which she had suffered
being recorded in the hospital book), Maybriek
calmly and stoutly and remorselessly administered
to her suffering spouse one dose of poison after
another day by day. Mrs. Maybriek, concerning
whose sanity there were no doubts, had powerful
social influence at her back, and was reprieved ;
Mrs. Pearcey, who was a nobody, lias been care-
fully hanged. It is such things as this which
make people wonder whether the scales of justice
aren’t loaded.
# * *
During the Pearcey-Hogg murder-trial the
Court was crowded day after day with “peopleof
family ” —mothers and daughters, husband's and
wives, brothers and sisters —armed with ppera-
glasses, sherry-flasks and sandwich-cases.

Dead dukes seem to have been a drug on
the market last week. Bedford, one of the
wealthiest and-most grasping of London land-
owners, has passed away to regions where the bad
language of his tenants can’t pursue him. The
old curmudgeon was probably the best-hated
autocrat in the London W. C. district, and it may
be taken for granted that many a bottle of
champagne was cracked in honour of the demise
of the man who made each “Bedford lease an
incitement to revolution. In the art of raising l
rents and imposing “conditions” upon the
denizens of his estate the Duke had few rivals
even in the House of Peers. Out of pure
cussedness he refused to entertain any scheme for
the improvement of Covent Garden Market,
whilst his ancestral fondness for blocking up
thoroughfares with iron gates amounted to a
disease. He belonged to the good old Tory school
this Bedford, and the fact that he pegged out
peacefully instead of being prematurely groaned
to death by an indignant populace is mainly
attributable to the care with which he played dark
off the weather bow, waiting for the Wrath that
has at last arrived.
# * *
The Duke of Somerset’s death, reported
by cable last week, gave a shock of surprise to the
toiling millions who were not previously aware
that the octogenarian had ever been born.
Although very blue-blooded, Somerset was not
what is known as a “great” duke. Anthony
Trollope was fond of satirising, in his innocuous
novels, the relative importance of such people,
and always quoted that fictitious old sinner, his
Grace of Omnium, as the typical “great’’duke.
Omnium took no part in politics, and had never
publicly distinguished himself in any direction.
But he enjoyed a private reputation for being
shockingly giddy in a senile, ducal kind of way,
and made it the business of his life not to “un-
bend,” wherefore sassiety, standing aside as
Omnium tottered along, accepted his greatness as
an article of faith. Somerset was simply a dull,
decent, vegetable sort of Duke who made no
difference. He didn’t even have one relative con-
cerned in the Cleveland-street scandal, Lord
Arthur Somerset being the son of Beaufort, a fact
which gives the latter a fair claim to be considered
a great duke, quite apart from his celebrated

The association (more or less remote) of
Governors Carington, Jersey and Hopetoim with
the private banking trade “at home,” reminds
us that joint-stock banks have been knocking the
stuffing out of private county-family businesses
for years past, so it is about time that one or two
of those solemn venerable institutions went bung.
They don’t invite vulgar outside custom. If an
unknown person, suffering . from the name of
Jones, falters in, with the intention of opening
an account, he is asked for references and glared
at through gold-rimmed eyeglasses until he gives
up all idea of banking with the aristocracy. And,
seeing that it is so difficult to get one’s money
into these high-bred shops, the day cannot be far
off when it will be dashed hard to get the sugar
out again. This may be a vewwy dweadful para-
graph, but it is compiled on sound commercial
principles.

The Czar, it is cabled, has simply returned
the petition sent by the Lord Mayor of London
asking that the Russian Jews be persecuted no
more. However, in the long run the Jews will be
found capable of effectually taking their own part.
Thei-e seems to be little doubt that the difficulties
of Baring Brothers and Co., which have caused
such a sensation throughout the world, have been
immediately caused by the Jews. They saw their
opportunity and seized it in order to deal a blow
at the one great English house remaining in the
foreign banking business, and through it at the
Russian Government.

The N.S.W. Ca\ airy forces -ire to have
not only a full-dress uniform but a mounted band,
the musical instruments for which have already
been imported. These pieces of gorgeous extrava-
gance must, of course, have been personally
assented to by that fine showy old agent of the
Imperial Government, Sir Henry Parkes,
G.C.M.G., &c., &c. It is interesting to know
that “with the exception of the drummer, who is
to have a piebald, the bandsmen will bo mounted
on greys. The band will be the first of its kind
established in the colonies, and will, in all pro-
bability, make its appearance in the metropolis on
such occasions as the opening of Parliament and
the Queen’s Birthday Review.” In other words,
it is to ba used as a thread of “ the silken bonds,”
This absurd outlay is in strict keeping with the
grotesque vulgarity of the appearance of the
Sydney Lancers. Let us hope that the band will
be in full blast on the day of the opening of
Parkes’ Deadhouse.
* * *
By the way, we heard the other day a
story that casts a bright light upon the vain-
gloriousness of Parkes’ real character. A firm of
publishers had (probably with a view to a Govern-
ment subvention) got him to accept the dedica-
tion of a certain Australian book. The words of
the dedication, wherein was included a list of his
titles and gewgaws up to date, were submitted to
him in a proof, of which he approved. A day or
two afterwards he got word that the King of
Italy, in recognition of the consideration with
which the N.S.W. Government had received the
survivors of the ill-fated expedition of the Marquis
de Rays, had conferred on him a commandership
of the Order of the Dead Bud, or something of
the sort (we have a bad memory for kingly dis-
tinctions), and old man Parkes sate him down and
wrote to the publishers ; “You will have observed
that His Majesty the King of Italy has been
pleased to confer upon me the knightly Order of
the Dead Bud. Please have the dedication altered
in terms of the announcement.”

John Woods’ suggestion that the whole of
the unoccupied land in front of Sydney G.P.O.
should be converted into a square is a good idea.
But when Mr. Woods further artfully proposes
that the square “ should be named after some one
of our living politicians ” {i.e., Parkes) he deals in
absurdity. “Parkes’ Square!” Parkes never
was square.

Each morning two men may be observed

If any man of learning can solve this
scientific problem he will do a good turn to the
community. When a citizen who has been
liquoring profusely resolves to start for home, and
finds a difficulty in getting out of the pub. owing
to there being three doors in a row where there was
only one before, ought he to rush at the middle
door, or should he try the one at the furthest end?
Also, supposing he gets outside and sees two cabs
where there is really only one, is it the first one
that is there or the second, or is the real one in
between the two? Many respectable gentlemen
who get home with difficulty would be glad of
information on these points.

The Chinese-cook question again :
Dear Bulletin, —I have seen much of Chinese cooks—
in this land and in others. My aversion to their ways is
not likely to be less keen than that of any other of your
readers, seeing that 1 am “ bonnet blue ” myself, and
have the tradesman’s prejudice against cheap competi-
tion. Certainly their modes of work are dirty. Certainly,
also, the yarn which your “ Schduffin ’’-contributor sent
you may be true. At any rate it is does not involve
any impracticability, and its hideous possibility
was the more interesting to me, from my knowledge that
the sort of people who employ a Chinese cook are not
usually contented with the amount of work he can
reasonably do with his hands alone. But when you let
some “ new 7 chum” fellow, wiio itches with the desire to
“ go one better” than t’other, unnecessarily horrify people
with the iced cake blague (I don’t know an equivalent
word), and you then afterwards take from Lithgow
Lawson the confirmation, strong as Holy Writ, that he
has seen it done himself, it is time, in the interests
of truth and pure morality, to put a pound
cr two on the valve. The thing is not impossible. Few
things are impossible, they say. This is only impractic-
able, which is a far more difficult bill to fill. Tell you
what I did see once. I came into my kitchen late one
night—’twas in a big hotel up north, not so many years
back, and found my Chow third cook, “ mid codings on,”
paring his toe-nails with my pet “ couteau d’office.” He
left!— “Gros Bonnet.”

The following spectacle is one that may be
seen any day on a Sydney tram-or on any other
tram, for that matter. First of all an innocent
young female comes in and sits down with a
modest smile as if there were something amusing
in the mere fact of her presence in that particular
spot. Then she settles her dress, and puts herself
to rights generally, and smiles a great glad smile
that suggests the reflection of the morning sun on
the bright glass-eye of day. By-and-bye the con-
di*-*or asks for her fare, and she finds it in the
nethermost bowels of her pocket, and as she fishes
it out from that receptacle she smiles some more
with a look of Christian resignation as if she were
resolved to bear up against all manner of affliction,
and when he hands over the change her face lights
up with a smile of joyous intelligence as if she
had been staggered by a great inspiration. After
a while she smiles over again because she finds she
has to get out at the next corner, and when the
tram stops she smiles because it has stopped, and
as she gets out she trips on her dress and screams
in an engaging sort of way, and then she smiles
on general principles, and when the tram starts
she smiles for no reason in particular, and finally
she trots away still smiling. And meanwhile the
other female passengers have their souls filled with
murder, and long to heave her into the street on
account of her smile. Somehow she aggravates
them.

The amalgamation of the legal professions

Bar that he shall accept a lump-sum per annum

Senator Ballingall, of lowa, a good speci-
men of the typical Yankee amateur Colonel, is
now paying a second visit to Sydney—apparently
WOMAN IN BUSINESS.
H E: “Mary Jane, all is discovered at the bank ! I am a defaulter. Quick ! pack my
things, I’m off ? ”
SHE : “How horrid of you ! Why, this is the night we are to go to the Flareups’ ball.
What excuse shall I make for you?”
on a self-advertising tour. He is quite hungry to
be interviewed; and the fact sticks out a mile,
whether he is showing you his portrait as printed
in some New York paper or other right alongside
that of the President Harrison (who probably
didn’t sit in the same gallery and spit into the
same cuspidor as the gallant Colonel when the two
likenesses were being taken), or toying with the
monstrous 20-foot gold chain which he wears
round his neck and—beg pardon, Mr. M‘Elhone
his “ binjie.” The chain was given him, he says,
by his brethren of the lowa hotelkeepers’ associa-
tion, and on each link is stamped the name of a
member of the fraternity. lowa being a prohi-
bition state, the publicans can’t sell alcohol unless
they break the law, and so it may happen that
each linkof theßallingallian chain doesn’t represent
several hundred damned souls as would probably
be the case were such a chain constructed under
the auspices of any Australian society of whisky-
slingers. The gallant Colonel avers that he is in
favour of State inebriate asylums, which, as he is
also in favour of public-houses, must be regarded
as a most fortunate thing. He asserts that the
American Democrats are Freetraders. _ “ The
wave of progressive thought,” says he, “is carry-
ing ns all towards the bourne of Freetrade,”
(though when he talked to us he used good, prosaic
public-house phraseology—this poetic sentence is
ascribed to him by a Sydney Daily Telegraph
reporter). When he turned up at The Bulletin
office we asked him whether the American Demo-
crats really were Freetraders. He said “Yes.”
Then said we: “Oh, you are all Georgeites?”
“ Oh, no !” replied the Colonel, indignantly and
obviously on the verge of a violent passion—
“ George is nobody. tie has no following to
speak of.” “ But,” said we, “ George is the only
real Freetrader. He is the only politician who
believes in allowing all foreign and nigger-labour
products to come in free.” “Oh,” answered the
Colonel, “ we don’t believe in unnecessarily taxing
things which we can’t produce to advantage.”
“Well, then,” we replied, “you are a discrimi-
nating Protectionist.” “No,” replied Colonel
Ballingall, hideou b lisgusted with our beastly
ignorance in conn aig him with such a mean
and impotent institution as Henry George, we
believe in a revenue-tariff which will incidentally
assist our American manufactures.” Moral:
There arc no real Freetraders in the whole world,
except the cranks with the wild eyes and the long
hair.

The largo, fat female who conducts visitors

the spot where he received the first thrust from
the dadger ; to the left is where he fell martially
wounded ; in front is the hearth marked with a
cross in black tiles where ’is lofty spirit took its
flight; and adjoining the white marble clnmminey-
piece is a secret closet where our rupper ouse-
maids keeps their brooms an’ buckets; an
anything you like to give me will be received with

“R.C.D.,” who writes to the daily press,
is quite right. The quack-medicine man who
exposes in the shop-window of a leading Sydney
street, a hideous picture illustrative of disease,
should be proceeded against by the police. Ihe
Bulletin presumes that if the quack exposed in
the window the diseased man instead of the
picture of the diseased man, the exhibition would
be officially regarded as obscene. _lf the original
would be obscene the photograph is obscene like-
wise. To show photographs of ghastly cankers in
order to frighten people into buying nostrums is
as offensive as showing sores in public to excite
nitv —a custom long since put down by law.

There is a fine, full-flavoured snuffle about
the following extract from a letter written by one
of the band of holy young men and women who,
last month, sailed from Sydney to join the Inland
China mission ;
It is such a privilege to be travelling with Mr. Taylor ;
he is a real spiritual father to us all. The order of the
day is to rise soon after 5 a.m., private Bible-reading till
breakfast, then a lesson in the Chinese language, and
after that united Bible-reading until dinner, then Chinese
again for several hours, interspersed with talking and
hearing lessons. After tea, if not too hot, we write and
sing for a while, and after another time for prayer and
Scripture-reading together, we retire for the night, to
sleep if possible.
Just notice, dear friends, that all spiritual work
is done “ together ” by these good young men and
women ! Anyone who has ever travelled on a ship
and observed the ways of men and maids with
regard to ocean choir-practice, will fully appre-
ciate the humour and the probabilities of the
situation.

Somebody wants to know the Index Ex-

Not very long ago Melbourne was favoured
with a decent sort of pressman, fresh from

midst of all the fellows, while Gommy was holding
forth :—“Look, you’re the most dangerous revo-
lutionist who ever came here, with all your yarns

aristocracy.” In fact, he did remind one of the

A young Englishwoman, only four months

who tells Adolphus to cook the dinner himself,

The other morning at 3 a.m. a raid was
made upon the house of a resident of Woodville-
road, Granville, Sydney, by four revolver-armed
policemen and an inspector, who carried a warrant
to arrest the resident for running a “ private still.”
All the members of the family were much sur-
prised at the charge; but the stern officers of
justice were very confident about the matter,
and, saying they “had already inspected the
still,” would insist on dragging their prisoner in
his night-garments to the end of his garden or
paddock (to convince him that they knew their
business and had not gone to the trouble of getting
a warrant for nothing)—only to discover that
the suspected “still” was a huge incubator at
work hatching eggs ! The incident, however, has
a serious side to it, as it considerably added to the
serious illness of the suspected man’s wife.

The Bulletin presumes that the police
consider themselves safe in the abovementioned
matter, on the good old well-worn ground that
they had a warrant and “ reasonable and probable

in its employ a set of officials so stupid and
uninstructed that they confound a machine for
chicken-hatching with a contrivance for cheating
the revenue somebody ought surely to pay a
penalty.

Heredity of Crime.
CURIOUS PHASES AND THE DIREFUL
RESULTS OF INHERITED DISEASE.
Doubtless crime is committed from the mere
love of it. The identity of “Jack the Ripper”
remains undiscovered, and so we do not know
what impelled him to the commission of his
atrocious crimes. Little doubt he was insane, his
actions controlled by an abnormal condition of
the mind ; it is plain none of the ordinary reasons
for crime prevailed in this case. He was, perhaps,
a victim of some hereditary taint, which drove
him to acts against which his will revolted, and
from which in his rational moments his soul
recoiled in horror. A French novelist of realism
makes the hero of a late novel of such a character.
He was a locomotive engineer, a thoroughly com-
petent and reliable man ; but if he chanced to be-
hold the white throat of a woman, a wild frenzy
seized him ; he could not control a desire to
plunge a knife in it. He was aware of his in-
firmity, fought it with stubborn will, denied him-
self the society of women, and for years controlled
himself. At last he meets his fate ; finds pleasure
in her society, with no return of his old longing
for blood, until he flatters himself he is safe. But
one night she meets him with gleaming throat
bare ; the uncontrollable impulse seizes him ; he
cannot resist ; as she throws her loving arms
about him, he thrusts the knife into her neck,
and she falls, a victim to the madness of tainted
blood. Fortunately for the victims of ordinary
forms of inherited disease they may protect them-
selves before it obtains dominance in the system.
Inherited kidney disease is especially dangerous,
but may be successfully resisted. “In 1883 1
was so near death’s door with an inherited and
complicated case of Bright’s disease,” writes James
H. Dove, 217 Bald win-street, Alpena, Mich.,
August 11, 1890. “which had baffled all remedies
and medical assistance obtainable, that I was
given up by friends and physicians as beyond all
recovery. In this extremity I was induced to try
Warner’s safe cure, which very soon gave me
relief, and led me to persevere in its use, until I
again became able to attend to my business. My
case is well known in this community, and I feel
fully warranted in recommending Warner’s safe
cure in cases of kidney disease, knowing full well
that I would have long since been in my grave
had it not been for the use of this remedy.” Men
and women inherit genius, talent, all mental and
physical qualities ; and it- is now well established
that all phases of physical as well as mental disease
are transmissible.

As the N.S.W. District Courts Act allows
retiring D.C. judges but half salary as a pension,
it would be impossible for one of the two sug-
gested retirements to take place, for the simple
reason that as the judge cannot live on his salary
he could not possibly exist on his pension.

“Fancy a single mare being thamother of three
winners of different ages at the one meeting and on the
one day !” says a Sydney Sunday paper. Such shameful
depravity on the part of a single mare should be inquired
into by the Social Purity Brigade at once; And this
reminds us of the true story of the Western man who
returned a £2O Maiden Plate money to the secretary of a
racing club near Bathurst, with the explanatiojjthaj; he
had discovered his mare was in foal.at the time 'Sjfle, won,
and consequently could not fairly be entitled to 'such a
prize. He was a twin brother to the good young man
that died.

A N.S.W. doctor, for shooting game in the
Close season and a publican for cooking it, were fined
heavily, the other day. Which reminds us that the
Police Magistrate at Forbes, N.S.W. is an ardent sports-
man and a staunch upholder of the law. There are other
ardent sportsmen in Forbes who are not such staunch
supporters of the law, and these did a little duck-shooting
in the close season not many years ago. The proceeds
Were duly handed over to a certain ancient hotel-
keeper with instructions to “do them proper” for lunch.
They were done “proper,” but as ill-luck would have it,
the P;M. came to lunch on that day of all days in the
year, and sat an unseemly time over his meal. The
illegal “ shootists ’" had their ducks spoilt, and have been
blessing the P.M. ever since.

The Australian lady-cricketers are getting dis-
organised already, and threaten to break up. A Sydney
showman tried to hire the team for public exhibition at
20s. per girl for each day’s play, but the captainess
rejected the offer rather peremptorily, partly because she
considered the terms inadequate, and partly because she
didn’t desire that any miserable male speculator should
have a lien over her. When the team heard of it, how-
ever, and realised that they had missed a chance of forty
ice-creams per diem, they fired much strong language at
the bosj of the show and demanded her resignation
only, as it happened, she didn’t resign. She had started
the thing, and supplied the brains and the experience,
and most of the energy, and a good part of the money ;
and if the whole club resigns she will stay on just the
same, and play by herself. And now the rest of the
cricketers don’t know whether to leave, or to hit her on
the head with a stump, or simply to sulk and cast reflec-
tions on her figure and her hair, and utter unjust
aspersions concerning her feet and her bonnet, and pass a
resolution that she is horrid. So there !

The totalisator is very popular in W.A. At the
recent meeting of the W.A. Turf Club at Perth, during
the two days no less than £5OOO passed through the
machine. There was little or no open betting, as the few
local books were unable to give anything like reasonable
odds. Last year an Adelaide bookmaker came across,
but he was only moderately well supported, and did not
repeat his visit this year.

The lamented Moorhouse, who was debarred
from swallowing “ great masses of food ” some time ago,
makes the most original suggestion which we have yet
heard of for the abolition of gambling. He proposes that
all gamblers should agree not to take a stake when they
win, but to pay it all over to some charitable institution,
and by this means he considers that, nap, 100, horse-
racing and similar pursuits would be freed from that
element of unholy greed which tends to demoralise their
votaries. There is a Christian element hitched on some-
where to this simple scheme, but The Bulletin is over-
come by emotion, and backs out silently without any
further comment. A bishop like that is altogether too
harmless for his job.
# * *
Mr. Billy Murphy, who first made his name in
Sydney and always got the best of fair treatment there,
can’t forget the licking he got from Griffo, and blames
everybody and everything but the “flashness” that pre-
vented him from training for the result. “Mr.” Griffo,
the champion, should profit by the example of his
defeated rival, hilt he probably won’t.
* # #
The Adelaide people are mad over Giffen’s
great score against Victoria, and an effort is being made
to raise £lOO by shilling subscriptions for the ohampion.
The leading men in the matter are Sir E. T. Smith, who
has yelled for “ George ” for years, and the portly Caleb
Peacock. The latter went to England on the same boat as
the first Australian team. Apropos, “Tommy” Horan
formed a minstrel company on board-ship. “Tommy”
was “ bones,” and Peacock acted with success as “ inter-
locutor.”

According to general expectation, John
Dempsey, the gallant victor of 50 fights, for years the un-
disputed middle-weight champion of the world, was
beaten by Robert Fitzsimmons, the Scotch-Maoriiand
blacksmith, inside 13 rounds after a hurricane fight for
£2200. La Blanche heat Dempsey some months ago.
Few fighters have the brains of Larry Foley, who knew
when to give the game up.

Some weeks ago The Bulletin recommended
the first flight of Sydney peds. to try their luck abroad.
We notice that in the recently-declared starts for a big
handicap, at Sheffield, Hutchens, the scratch-man, is set
to give the following starts to Australian -runners :
Samuels, l|yds, ; Joe Price, Tjjyds.; M'Garrigal, Layton,
luid NViinjiuis, 2|yds. The only one of the lot who would
stand a chance of winning is Williams, and it is hard to
see why he is so favourably treated compared with his
fellow-countrymen. Just four years ago Hutchens in-
formed the writer that Williams, matured and properly
trained, was far the best sprinter in Australia. Their
“ matches ” notwithstanding, he had nbt a high opinion
of Malone or Samuels, rpid thought that either to win at
Sheffield would require a good start. In fact he thought
Malone hadjiot improved on his amateur form in the old
country, '

Abe Willis, “ Shadow ” Maher, and Jem Hall,
three of our best boxers, were to sail in the Alameda for
’Frisco on Wednesday this week.
* * #
Ike Weir boxed four rounds with Abe Willis at
the Australian Athletic Club, Sydney, on Saturday even-
ing last. Ike—he comes from Belfast, Ireland—was
attired in green trunks and red stockings (the green above
the red), and looked like a song-and-dance merchant.
However, he stripped splendidly, and is one of the
smartest men with head, hand and foot, we’ve seen any-
where, but his staying powers are doubtful. Weir never
attempted to box, he leaped about like a kangaroo,
ducked under Willis’ arms, hit round his back, contorted his
face and wriggled his body till everyone roared, except
Abe, who got very wild. They were to have boxed six
rounds, but in the fourth Weir went queer inside, and
simply walked round Willis crab-fashion till the latter
worthy, disgusted and annoyed, threw a handspring,
turned a somersault, and finished the farce. Whereupon
Larry Foley remarked; “If Weir’s wise lie won’t meet
Fuller on Monday,” and he didn’t. Then Oriffo, having
got leave from the other club to postpone his match
with Powell, if necessary, mounted tiro platfoim,
and said he wouldn’t let Weir go away saying
no one in Australia would fight him, and Foley
offered to back Griffo for any sum from £5OO to
£lO,OOO, and allow Weir from £lOO to £3OO as expenses,
according to stake. Then Weir said engagements, pre-
vented him staying here, and promised Griffo a big purse
and a good time in ’Frisco if he’d fight there. Griffo
then made six more speeches, and nothing was done.
Mr. Ike “ Spider” Weir—“ Flea” would have been a more
appropriate nickname—is a very clever young man and a
decent sort of chap, but he sings comic songs with too
much abandon, plays the piano too well, smokes too many
cigars, and shifts lemonade too handily to last out a hardy
youngster in a severe battle.

Says “ Pendragon ” (and he .ought to know)
“ I have got it into my head that more men have been
killed with the gloves than with the naked fist; that all
the thick ears and flattened noses of fighting men have
been given with the gloves, and not with the naked fist :
that, though I have seen a good many prize-fights, I
never saw- a man knocked out with the naked fist, while 1
have known scores who have been knocked out with the
gloves ; and that only a couple of years ago, at a ‘ car-
nival’ of the Boxing Association, whose president swore
to the mildness, tenderness, and innocnonsncss of boxing,
I saw more .punishment given with full-sized gloves (quite
lOoz. gloves) in three minutes than I had ever before seen
given with a naked fist in double the time. ’

AMERICA’S GREATEST STATESMAN
At one of the large dinners given at the seat of
government lately, the great orator said : “Permit
me, ladies and gentlemen, t) say that there is no
drink in the world so conducive to social inter-
course as the -famous St. Louis Lager Beer. As
a mental and physical relaxative it has no equal.
It refreshes the body and exhilarates the mind.
It gently moves the blood to accelerated action,
and arouses the more generous sentiments that
cluster around the human heart. Its action in-
spires noble thoughts, and at the banquet table,
with intellect and genius, it touches chords of
inspiration that prompt to lofty efforts.”
THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word A cure ; it is not nibrciy a
relief, and in no sense a cure-all j it is the product
of scientific research;
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.,
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a Superior
curative virtue is superadded.
‘ sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ing] y and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer,
Gth. Each Constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain;
SOME AUSTRALIAN EVIDENCE.
The editor of that favorably known and pro"
gressive periodical, the Illustrated Sydney
News, writes that he “ has much pleasure in
giving the proprietors of St. .Jacobs oil his testi-
mony with respect to its wonderful curative
properties. The editor has suffered acutely with
chronic sciatica, and has found the greatest relief
by the application of St. Jacobs oil to the affected
parts, and has no hesitation in recommending it
to sufferers.”
The lady who edits the Band of Mercy
(Sydney), also states that she “can testify to the
value of St. Jacobs oil, as it is used in her family
witlr great benefit.”

abuse your wife, baste the baby, kick the cat, or,

out of order, and, in event of accident, can be

Premier Munro, in his capacity as a
Scotchman, is evidently resolved that bang does
not go saxpence with any unnecessary velocity.
When it was proposed to celebrate the end of the
session with the customary £(>00 picnic down the
harbour, under the thin device of inspecting the
whitewashed fortifications and looking with an
unintelligent eye at the gun which won’t go off,
the old man nobly responded that the members
would have to stand the expense among them ;
and he and his colleagues even paid their own
railway fares when they went down to orate at
Geelong. Until his majority is a little better
organised Munro evidently intends to manifest a
lofty contempt for coin and all other worldly con-
siderations.
There is a lot of unconscious humour
about, the Australian Natives’Association. Here
is a sample:—
Among the correspondence dealt with were letters from
several branches, asking the permission of the board to
congratulate Mr. Peacock, M.L.A., on his inclusion in the
Munro Ministry. It was decided to inform the branches
in question that in the opinion of the board it was quite
unnecessary to congratulate any of the members of the
A.N.A. on attaining public positions or other honourable
distinctions, as the time had passed when the attainment
of such positions or'distinctions by Australian Natives
could be regarded as anything unusual.
Poor Peacock with his appalling laugh is only an
honorary Minister, without portfolio or screw or
any recognised situation whatever. And now one
half of the A.N.A. wants to congratulate him on
the surprising circumstance that he should be
allowed to hang on gratis at the tail of a Cabinet
in his own country, while all the power and the
money is taken by imported politicians ; and the
other half points out elaborately that the time is
past when anyone need be surprised to see a Native
rise to eminence, and that though the spectacle of
Peacock running in the mud behind the Ministerial
vehicle, and trying to hang on, is a noble and
cheering thing, still it must be accepted with
dignified calm as a matter of everyday occurence.
And now the toughest point of etiquette in exist-
ence is badly in want of settlement, for Peacock
has got to decide whether he should thank the
A.N.A. with all his heart for its obvious good in-
tentions, or whether he should cowhide that body
for its infamous inability to express itself, and
then sue it for libel.

AYER’S PILES are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
ache, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and bowels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relieve
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, rich blood. These well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an Indefinite period
and in any climate. They should be in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

Wolfe's Schnapps—It is grand.
An obviously - inspired letter signed
“ Lever,” concerning the N.S.W. railway depart-
ment troubles, has appeared in the Sydney daily
pap rs. The Bulletin says obviously-inspired
because although it was printed in the S.M.
Herald on the day after it was written, it never-
theless found a place in the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph in leaded type 24 hours later still. Here is
a slab of it:—
The Railway Commissioners have been appointed for
seven years, and during that period clause 15 of the bill
bringing them into existence vests the absolute right of
the removal of any member of the staff in their hands.
Let the public rest assured that the Commissioners haye
not acted in tins matter from caprice, hut deliberately so,
from causes which to them are sufficient. It would
obviously he as absurd to demand their reasons in this as
in any other case of dismissal which has occurred, as it
would he an infringement of their undoubtedly vested
tights. They are lenient enough in their treatment of
their employes, and would only exercise their
right of dismissal under a painful sense of duty.
The Commissioners may rest assured that their

authority in this and in any ulterior measures which they
may be forced to take will be upheld by the vast majority
in this country, who place confidence in their wisdom,
founded on their two years’ beneficent control of the
railways ; and that those who would seek to discredit
either their discretion or ability are in a hopeless, although
a blatant, minority'.
“Absurd to give reasons, indeed !” It is just as
“ absurd ” to give to the public reasons why a man
should be hanged or imprisoned as to give reasons
for depriving him of his situation and living. No
better example of the insolence and irresponsi-
bility of the bureaucracy which in a dozen quar-
ters menaces public freedom in Australia has been
afforded than “ Lever’s ” letter. The public are
going to have reasons, inasmuch as they are the
employers and the masters of both the Commis-
sioners and the men, and the final judges between
them. Who are the Railway Commissioners that
they should expect to burke a criticism which
beats fiercely on the Ministers of the Crown and
on the Judges of the Supreme Court ?

A'ameda. His first go will be with Griffo.
When Murphy and Griffo fought, Murphy gave
in for want of condition, only, he could have gone
on all night so far as punishment was concerned,
and both in their best “nick,” the writer would
back Murphy to win. Now, whilst his condition
lasted, Weir made a perfect fool of Murphy,
hitting him when and where he liked, and to give
the Maorilander his due, it was only his dogged
courage which pulled him through to the point
when Weir fell weak. On these lines Griffo must
lay himself out to take some sort of a licking
before he wears Weir down, if it is his fate so
to do.

The following’ important fact cannot be too frequently
Impressed upon the minds of suffering humanity, that
Mr, Gould, E.8.P., of Bradford, has for sonv time past
and is now giving the Hop prescription fo” BiMers to
all applicants who send a Post Office Order for Sixpence
for postage. Anyone in possession of this valuable pre-
scription can for lOd. make a quart of this marvelous
medicine, and for Is. Bd. can make two quarts, suffi-
cient to 5-erve for two weeks. It may be interesting to
learn that with this prescription all kinds of hopele s
cases have been treated with success when all other
remedies had absolutely failed. People who have been
partly paralysed have been relieved or cured with this
prescription, others have had their reason restored;
people who could not sleep have bad their sleep re-
stored, others who could not eat have had their ar petite
restored; people who had suffered for years with in-
digestion and its consequences have had their d gestive
powers r* stored; people who have suffered martyrdom
wth a disordered liver, nervous debility, Ac., have
been cured; peopl > subject to an accumulation of
wind and water have found it disappear under its
influence. A gentleman at Lincoln subject to fits
fortnightly has not had a fit from the first moment
he began taking it. People troubled for years with
constipation have had their bowels become regular under
its influ nee. It is a choice, rare, remarkable remedy.
The prescription is simple, it is cheap, it is good. Those
who haven't sent for it should. It will be found safe,
sure, and reliable in a most all a lments incident to the
human frame. It is a tonic, alterative, and an aperient
combined of marvellous curative properties. These
important facts may seem incredible, but it has done
far more than is here claimed for it, proof of which is
sent with each Prescription, and it is given absolutely
free of charge to all applic nts who send a Post ' ffice
Order for Sixpence for postage of the same, Celonial
stamps or coins are useless. A mode of self-treatment
at home has been a long-felt want by all well-regulated
minds, and wall be found exceedingly advantageous
to sensible persons who desire to know whnt they
are swallowing Address Mr. GOULD, E.8.P., 479,

THE THEATRICAL MANAGERS’ PLAINT.
Suggested by a song in “ The Gondoliers,”
In days of old when shows were few
And “ settings-up ” not cost-ly,
The runners yearly richer grew—
At least they prospered most-ly ;
But now, when shows are all around,
And each is bound to hold its ground
By adding to expen-ses,
Though prices stick about the same,
Why, players of the cut-throat game
(Who’ve only got themselves to blame)
Can scarce retain their sen-ses.
’Tis sad, although ’tis true, you know,
In countries young and sun-ny,
When folks can’t go to every show
Whose class is high and prices low,
Then bitter tears from bosses flow,
For none are making mon-ey.
Chorus:
Though you and we care not a D.,
But laugh Ha ! Ha ! in joyous glee,
And think it rather fun-ny,
There’s not much joke in going broke
For want of making mon-ey.
Two hundred legs upon the stage,
Or casts “unpreceden-ted,”
Are wanted in the present age
Ere patrons feel contented ;
Five shillingsworth for half-a-crown
They need to bring them into town
Anon they’ll ask for train-fare;
And buyers taught to pick and choose
Are always likely to refuse
The best of goods, so showmen Jose—
They cannot long the strain bear.
Of costs that grow and prices low
G. Musgrove is a darn-er :
When biz is slow at every show
Great Rignold smites his brow a blow,
And Messrs. Brough and Boucico
Hate Williamson and Gar-ner.
Chorus :
Though matters thus don’t trouble us,
They say that Rignold makes a fuss,
And Musgrove is a darn-er,
And roads are rough for Bouce. and Brough,
And Williamson and Gar-ner.

THOSE MELODRAMA “PAPERS.”
“ Let me hut once secure the papers.’’
No character upon the stage;
Of all the good or bad ’uns,
So moves the meekest soul to rage,
So altogether maddens,
As he, or she, who travels round
A-cutting stupid capers
Until the dreary bore has found
Those melodrama “papers.'’
The-villain mostly has. the job,
And everywhere goes buzzin’
For opportunities to rob
His uncle or his cousin ;
He sports an aggravating smile
Like countermen at drapers’,
And seeks, with perseverance vdie,
Those melodrama “ papers.”
All times the gallant hero is
Absorbed in paper-chases,
And drivels through the hoary biz
In dark and lonely places ;
He rummages at dead of night
With ghostly tallow-tapers—
At last, at last he brings to light
Those melodrama “ papers !”
Or heroines, all golden hair,
On tearful travels go forth
And cry aloud, in wild despair,
For stolen wills, and so forth,
Which, as it happens, always are
Of destinies the shapers—
They make the fortune of the “ star,”
Do melodrama “ papers.”
When villains have them safe in hand
To no account they turn ’em—
So far as one can understand
They neither use nor burn ’em ;
Of idiots, in this respect,
They seem to be the apers ;
No grain of sense can one detect
In melodrama “papers.”
Of uncle’s, or the cousin’s gore
They often cause the spilling,
Though copies might be purchased for
A modest little shilling;
There’s nothing in the hollow plot
Beloved by grinning gapers
More hollow than the awful rot
Of melodrama “papers.”

Writes the San Francisco Wasp :
Does anyone remember Haxton, one of the newspaper
men who rescued the Italian fisherman out at ’Frisco
Heads ? Haxton had a remarkable personality, and men
used to turn twice to look at him on the street. He is in
London these days and has struck a streak of pay-rook ;
his articles sell everywhere, and when the brief Kipling
fever is past, Henry Haxton is as likely as anyone to be
the next writer of whom the world talks.
Henry Haxton is the husband of a gifted wife,
Agnes Thomas, an actress well-known to Aus-
tralia. When he was here he had poor health and
the world did not go well with him. He had an
inconsiderable billet ’on a weekly paper, and
The Bulletin heard nothing of him until he came
one day to this office with the MS. of “John
Yissian’s Confession,” a psychological story pub-
lished in The Bulletin Christmas number of, we
think, three years ago, and is manifestly the work
of a writer little, if at all, removed from greatness.
Mind you get Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Rev. J. F. Ewing’s sermons are out in
Melbourne, and show he died just in time to
escape being questioned for his Doxy, like
Strong and Menzies. Drummond, Ewing’s best
friend, cleared promptly out of Melbourne, under
the glowering glances of the Unco, because he
thought that a man in moleskins tied with string
round the knee-cap, could be Guid.
Insist upon having Wolfe’s Schnapps.
A Melbourne weekly broke out violently
into quotation in the middle of a sentimental tale
the other day, and this is how the naughty comp,
set it up
The doubly-wedded man and wife,
Pledged to each other and against the world
With mutual onion.
“ Mutual Onion ” is splendid. Perhaps she began
on them raw, and he joined in from motives of
self-defence.
The popular liquor—Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Thus the Argus ;—
It has been made obligatory upon the mine-owner to
count the time of the eight hours’ shifts from the dis-
appearance of the miner from the surface until he re-
appears. In some mines as much as half an hour is thus
lost in each shift, and as the men are paid for eight hours
the profits are reduced by so much.
Yes, and for the time spent by the miner in
walking to and from the job, which, in some
instances, amounts to an hour or more, his time
(which is money) is reduced by so much also.
Wolfe’s Schnapps will make you a new man.
A number of London artists’ wives recently
met to consider the advisability of issuing a pro-
test against the use of models by their husbands.
The more modest evidently thought that their
artistic hubbies should drape or undrape no other
goddess before them; but others, understanding
that an artist painting from the nude can seldom
find a model perfect enough to sit for the entire
figure, proposed a system of exchange, whereby
Flakewhite could barter away his wife’s hips for
Ohromeyellow’s spouse’s bust —and the particular
charms of any artist’s wife might become the
common artistic property of the entire guild. The
meeting ultimately broke up in great disorder.
Ask for Wolfe’s Schnapps and take no other.
Director Ferguson, of the Premier Per-
manent Society, has received an address and a
purse of sovereigns because it has been resolved
that he did not wilfully ruin a few hundred poor
people who paid him to look after their money,
but merely helped to ruin them through negligence
or ignorance, or stupidity, or all three put
together. In other words, he took a decent income
in consideration of doing a certain thing well, and
he either did it badly or left it altogether undone,
and he has kept his own money while the people
who hired him are ruined. For these reasons Mr.
Ferguson, as already mentioned, has received a
purse of sovereigns, and he took the donation
with the serene expression of a man who felt he
deserved it. The donation for the people who
have gone broke through Ferguson and his col-
leagues is not yet forthcoming.

Our Trial Crushing.
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
Tin-can Gully was in very doubtful odour
amongst investors, for its reefs had hitherto
served only as a medium for extracting calls from
the general public of Peterstown —30 miles from
us—on the coast, and whence we drew our sup-
plies. On the other hand, a good deal of alluvial
had been got in the creeks, and while the Peters-
town folk were as a rule heartily sick of
“backing ” the claims, a few people persisted in
declaring that “ the alluvial had come from some-
where,” and that a big thing would be discovered
in Tin-can Gully some day.”
It would certainly be a good thing for Peters-
town if a decent reef or two were opened up, and
we Tin-can residents knew that if we could
fossick-out something a little better than “ pay-
able ” we could get it off at a good figure.
Peterstown, much aggrieved that some of the loan-
money had not found its way to that vicinity,
badly wanted to get a railway built inland, and it
was pretty well known that old Shand, the
member, would raise Cain on the Government
benches to get one, if he had anything to show in
support.
It was just at this time that our party—there
were four of us—got on to a very likely thing,
about two feet wide, of nice-looking, rust-
stained quartz, a good deal honeycombed.
At the surface an excellent prospect of
coarse gold could be obtained in the dish,
and although it did not improve as we sank upon
it, there was a kind of unexpressed feeling
amongst us that we were “ going to make a rise.”
We made no bones about telling qur acquaint-
ances that we thought “ we were in it this time,”
and so gradually Tin-can Gully came to look upon
the “Orphan Boy ” as a claim of many possibili-
ties.
I have said that there were four in our party—
to be more accurate I should have said that there
were three working miners and one outsider, the
local publican-and-storekeeper. The working-
three consisted of myself, Jack Thelwell, who had
been my mate for seven years, and an old “Cousin
Jack ” called “ Trev.” for short, whose full name
was Arthur Trevelyan. Trev. had been working
at the alluvial for some years, but joined us when
we determined to try the “ Orphan Boy ”—-he pre-
ferred reefing, he said.
When we had been a month at work, and the
reef began to look as if it were “ going down,” old
Jansen, the publican, went into Peterstown and
managed to get four of the leading lights in that
important town to come into the thing—they
paying us a small sum for their interest, and
agreeing to bear their share of the cost of con-
tinuing the shaft. This, of course, reduced our
interest in the claim, but enabled us to keep
on without running into debt while yet we were
making no returns.
Of course we meant to float the property —when
a miner makes a rise he wants to square up his
interests and knock off work, if he can, for a year
or two at least. Thelwell and myself were deter-
mined to take a trip to England and see London
Town, if the “ Orphan Boy ” would let us.
The nearest battery was about 10 miles off, and
when we had got the shaft down 70ft. it was
determined to break a sample lot of about 10 tons
of reef-stuff, send it by team to the mill, and offer
the mine to the public on the result. We arranged
it in this way. The interests in the mine were
divided in 70,000 shares, of which each of ns had
8000—the odd 6000 were put in the hands of a
Peters town broker, who agreed to pay all expenses
in connection with the registration and flotation.
As things turned out, this was a big lift to him
for so little work, seeing that the shares were all
subscribed, so to speak—but he was known to be
a good man at “booming” a mine, and perhaps
we lost nothing by being generous.
Well, we got out the sample lot of stone, but as
the teams could not come within two or three
hundred yards of the shaft we had to bag the
stuff and carry it down to them. After the second
day’s work was done, Thelwell remarked to me, in
the tent, while we were having our supper (Old
Trev. camped at the pub): “ Jim, do you know, I
think old Trev. and Jansen are up to some games
with this crushing.”
“ How’s that?” I asked.
“Well, you know Jansen has some nice quartz
specimens which he brought with him from the
North, and which he told us one night were
worth £35.”
“Yes,” I replied. ,
“ Well, look here. This morning he and irev,
came across the flat, and when they were passing
the clay waterhole, Jansen stooped down and
seemed to be dipping something like pebbles
into the mud, which he then replaced in his
pocket. If you remember, he and Trev. bagged
up the stuff'in the forenoon, while we carried it
down to the teams. I don’t like to fancy that our
claim is being salted, but if you put two and two
together you’ll perhaps agree that you and 1
should deduct about nine ounces from the result
of the crushing.” , .
This was rather an annoying piece of news.
Salting was bad enough, but, hangdt ally salting
by our own mates ! without our being told of it..
The only thing we could do was to watch the
course of events.
The first of the teams was back, and as the
Peterstown syndicate was now up, the mill was
set a-going. Three of the Peterstown folks went
right out and stayed at the mill while the stuff
was going through, and one of them hung on
about the claim, Thelwell and myself leaving old
Trev. to help load up the last team, which was
hourly expected. Just then a very funny thing
happened. The Peterstown man and myself went
off first, and it happened that I found when we
had gone hardly half-a-mile that I had left my pipe
behind. Our camp was built on a high bluff over the
creek, and at this moment we had just come round
the bridle-track, which was very circuitous, to
the foot of a rough stair which we had made to
carry up water for our use in cooking. Slipping
off my horse, I ran up to the tent and coming
out, I happened to cast my eye over towards the
bags piled up awaiting the team—and 111 be
hanged if old Trev., whose head was turned in
another direction, was not ripping open the
sewing of the bags, while a small wash-leather
bag, apparently containing about six or eight
ounces of alluvial, was lying on the topmost bag
close to his knee ! It was quite evident that he
was going one better"than old Jansen by putting
into each bag a little washdirt of good quality !
I rejoined the rest quietly and put Thelwell up
to the dodge. “Well,” he remarked, “Isuppose
we ought to expose the thing; but, Jiin, iu
hanged if I don’t think these Peterstown fellows
are un to some racket themselves. You know that
there has been a good ten tons of stuff sent away—
nearer twelve, I believe —and this fellow with us
says that we miners are never to be relied upon
for judging weights; but that Mr. Simpson, his
chum from Peterstown, is personally seeing the
stone weighed at the mill. ” . ,
On reaching the mill that afternoon we found
that everything went well. About five tons had
gone through, there were about two tons lying on
the floor, and this, with two tons which we had
left bagged, and which the team would bring in
that evening, would make nine tons —weighed
under Mr. Simpson’s personal supervision.
But one of the hands at the mill winked at me
that evening and remarked, “Your nine tons
are taking a d long time to go through this
mill, Jim”—and, dropping his voice, he added :
“ One of the Peterstown fellows relieved me from
feeding this afternoon, while the others took me
to their buggy and gave me a wet, and they aren t
usually so blessed liberal.”
And then I figured it out mentally thus :
oz. dwt.
11 tons of stone at |oz. to the ton .. 5 10
Say that Jansen and Trev. put in specimens
equal to ®
And that Trev. added alluvial equal to .. 6 0
And that one of the Peterstown men
chucked into the stamper-boxes a few
lumps of amalgam, worth say .. .. 12 0
The clean-up, therefore, gives .. .. 33 10
And as Simpson weighed the stone as 9 tons —result,
per ton 3oz. 14dwts. lOgrs. If Jansen deducts his lOoz.
he has still a good thing in 2oz. lOdwts per ton, and if
the Peterstown folk deduct 12oz. they have still a good
thing in over 2oz. per ton, and if old Trev. deducts 16oz,
he has a good thing in nearly 2oz. per ton.

Extract from the Peterstown Star .
We are glad to announce, on excellent authority, that
the favourable opinion so long'and firmly held by many
of our oldest citizens, of the character of the Tin-can reef-
ing district, has been thoroughly and triumphantly justi-
fied by the trial crushing of about 10 tons from the
bottom of the “ Orphan boy,” p.c.—which has resulted
in a yield of nearly four ounces to the ton. The reef is
now about two feet wide, and has all the appearance of a
true fissure vein, and we are informed by several well-
known townsmen, who are largely interested, that a
battery will at once be placed on the claim.
We understand that two of the lucky proprietors have
sold their interest to their co-shareholders for a large sum,
and intend to take a well-earned voyage to the old
country. Mr. Jansen, of the “ Pick and Dish,” at Tin-
can, and Mr. Arthur Trevelyan, however, are so well
satisfied with the result, that they intend to retain their
interests in full.
We take this opportunity of again urging our worthy
member, Mr. Shand, to bring the rich mineral resources
of the Tin-can district prominently before the Ministry,
with a view to opening up railway communications, &c.

George Bates, who settled on Kangaroo
Island and lived with the natives long before the
South Australian mainland was proclaimed and
occupied, is still alive. He is between 90 and 100
years old, but very feeble. The old man has
hyed on the Island, with no companion but his
wife, who is also alive, for nearly 60 years.
Mrs. O’Shea’s sister, Mrs. Steel, was in
the British divorce-court some years ago, “not over
a breach of her marriage vows, but merely for
their non-performance. As a romantic and love-
stricken girl she accepted Captain Steel on the
understanding that they should live apart. And
acting on this understanding she parted from her
husband at the church door, and never rejoined
him in his home. Years afterwards, finding that
his strange misfortune was a cloud on his profes-
sional career, he commenced a suit for the restitu-
tion of conjugal rights by way of clearing his
character, but never acted on the decree which he
triumphantly obtained. In fact, there was no
defence, and no other explanation beyond that
general family eccentricity which has led Mrs.
O’Shea to sacrifice her life for an Irish squireen,
without humour or small talk, and wearing muddy
boots, an ill-fitting frock-coat, and a soft brown
felt hat! ”

lhat gathering of solemn fiats known as
the Presbyterian Assembly rises reproachfully to
grab for the coppers as usual, and to prop up the
falling heavens with its old bald head. Listen :
The fruit and lolly shops are kept open for certain hours
of the Lord’s day under sanction of the law, and they are
traps to catch the children’s pennies designed for the
mission-box or the Sunday School. Every effort has been
used to lessen this Shocking Sin, and with some measure
of success.
It is the same old church as it always was, and the
same old parsons babbling about motes and atoms,
and clamouring after the baby’s half-penny in the
same grand old way. The dull, flabby, boneless
sin-shifter is always haunted by the fear that sax-
pence has gone bang in needless worldly in-
diligence instead of being given to him, as it ought
to be. He doesn’t bother much about war, or
disease, or any large questions of that description;
but the Shocking Bin which haunts him, like a
blue-moulded spectre rising on the wings of night,
is the fear that the coming race may invest its
copper in a clammy bun or a stick of toffee, so
that when he turns the miserable infant upside
down and shakes it in the name of the Loard
there will be no worldly assets left to fall out of
its pocket. Then he realises that the insolvent
state of that interted child of wrath is em-
phatically a Wrong Thing, and the pain and
indignation that are written upon his long, pale,
dreary countenance have to find vent in print, or
he will burst under the shadow of his own black
hat from the pressure of his inward emotion He
is only an ant cursing at the sun, but then he
doesn’t know it, and if anyone explains the fact to
him he mentions regretfully that his informant is
going to hell.

There are the usual premonitory signs of
another silver boom this time m iasmama. , I irst
of al ] the ™ was the inevitable prospector, who
w as f° un d pounding up some specimens, and who
then wen * and sold the product and got very
drunk on the money, and woke with a dreadful
bead on him next morning. Then came the rush
0 f a j 0 t niore prospectors, all anxious to find out
where the specimens came from, and the usual re-
port concerning “indications,” and the customary
rumour about the formation of a powerful syndi-
cate. Next, the original discoverers got gently
frozen out in the usual way, some of them trading
off their interest for an old horse, and some being
bounced off, while some were run in by the syndi-
cate for trespass, and a few more sold out for a
song after the syndicate had inebriated them, and
a benevolent speculator came along and induced
the rest, for their own good, to sign a legal docu-
ment about two feet long, and threw them over
the fence when they had signed it. About this
time a hook-nosed race began to pour into Tas-
mania and to sell shares and interests to each
other, and to swop “specimens,” and to take up
leases, and whenever a plain, ignorant digger found
anything some financier came along and jerked
bi m out by Act of Parliament. Then in a few
months more the boom will begin in earnest, and
every bird of prey will sell his lease to a company
at a high figure, and when the company bursts he
will buy it back with his pro. note at 18 months
without endorsement, and he will liquidate it,
and finance upon it, and consolidate it, and re-
organise it, and float it into 100,000 shares, 7s. 6d.
paid up; and finally the boom will burst, and the
public will find that it has paid about £2,000,000
f or an old hole in a damp hillside, and a dead
horse, and a rusted pickaxe, and will wonder in
the same invariable old way how the whole affair
came about. The public always wonders a good
deal over this question, but it never seems to make
, • ■ y ’
an y discoveries.
One of the most striking features of Mel-
bourne is its assortment of cripples. They are a
multitudinous race decorated with every known
variety of deformity and distortion, but whether
Melbourne grows its own cripples, or whether it
imports them, or whether they are artificially
manufactured, and form an industry instead of a
natural product, is uncertain. The average boot-
maker by Yarra’s crystal tide always exhibits in
his shop-window at least a dozen samples of boots
to fit as many different varieties of cripples,
There are boots for the man with two left legs
and no right one, and boots for the man with two
right legs and no left one, and hoof-pear for the
person with the club-foot—an individual who is
very numerous. Also the trade in artificial legs is
tremendous, and it is never safe to hit a passing
stranger in the street, for as likely as not he bad
his arm shot off when he was young and wears an
iron hook instead, and when he turns and coldly
sticks that implement into your head you are
liable to die of shock and amazement. Then
there are a strange variety of persons drifting
about the city who have had all their hair and
features blown off by an accident in a mine, and
persons who seem to have been frittered away in
an effort to pound themselves to death against a
brick wall; and parties who travel with a crutch,
or two crutches, or a crutch and a stick, or a pail'
of sticks, and several anomalous citizens pervade
Bourke-street on their hands because they never
had any at all. One of this latter class
garroted an inoffensive visitor recently, and when
a policeman endeavoured to arres£ him he fought
three rounds with the officer, and rurally fled in a
locomotive chair, and has not since been heard of.
Also there is a large and varied assortment of
hump-backed inhabitants, and a profusion of
knock-kneed men whose extremities spread to
such an extent that they • generally have one foot
on the staircase and the other protruding through
the window, and why all these people exist is a
mystery that no one has ever attempted to solve.
The old and hoary dodge of our fathers
has been repeated with the usual disastrous
results at Wellington (N.Z.), and another respect-
able family has gone into mourning over the
corpse of its dead reputation. The principal
sinner Was an old and esteemed Government
official, and the other person involved in the
transaction was his wife. It Was a peaceful,
moonlight night, with the ghost of a lost zephyr
rustling faintly among the lulls, and the male
malefactor, for purposes of his own, had stated
that he would be detained till a late hour toiling
in the service of an ungrateful nation. She said
that under these circumstances she would spend
the night with her sister. But about two hours
later he was floating serenely down the harbour
with two wildly dissipated friends and three
second-rate actresses, and they were howling a
comic song in chorus, and the ladies had borrowed
their belltoppers and had lent their own bonnets
in exchange, so that the party looked like six
escaped Aunt Sallies all liquoring up on the
bosom of the sea; and just then they nearly ran
down another boat loaded with a crowd of
revellers who were also whooping a song, and
throwing empty champagne - bottles overboard.
And from that other boat, as the two vessels
grazed each other, there came the shriek of a
deceived wife out on the rampage with two other
ladies and six vociferous male companions—
a shriek that seemed to be compounded of a
railway smash and a drunken boarder trying to get
upstairs on his hands, and an 801 b. dumb-bell
falling into a dinner-service, and a lion breaking-
up a tea-meeting, and a rhinoceros charging a
stock of galvanised iron ; and the guilty pair
realised that their scheme was exploded. Both
were seized at once with the idea of establishing
an alibi, and the two boats fled in two different
directions for the shore, and when they got on land
each party started at a run for home with the idea
of getting into bed and being fast asleep before
the other arrived, but this project unhappily fell
through. The lady nearly killed a tired cab-
horse on her journey, but just as she reached the
door her husband rounded the opposite corner on
foot with his hat gone and all the buttons started
off his waistcoat, and they met. Then they
repudiated the marriage-tie upon the doorstep,
and finally the wife departed in hysterics in the
bottom of the cab, and took the key with her, and
the locked-out husband slept at a pub. It is the
same old trouble that the human race has kept
falling into ever since Joseph was made a co-
respondent and Potipher went looking for a decree
nisi in Egypt, and it had the same old ending. It
always does, somehow.
u One tale is good until another is told.”
There is evidently no love lost between Francis
Hare, P.M., and Power, the bushranger, if we
are to draw an inference from the rival accounts
of the latter’s capture. In the LkadEh of Nov, 15
Superintendent Hare takes all the glory upon
himself, and says that Power was nothing but a
coward, and that he effected the arrest almost as
easily as he would that of an ordinary drunk and
disorderly. He also intimates that Power could
draw the long bow as well as, if not better, than
most people. In the Standard of Dec. 16 Power
retorts that the P.M. does not tell the truth, and
that it was he himself who was the coward—that,
in revenge for having his head dipped in a bag of
flour, he endeavoured to shoot him (Power) when
Nicholson had him handcuffed, and that Messrs,
Nicholson and Montford were in reality the
captors. Someone will now proceed to pass the
salt.
Mr. Herbert Reynolds, a very shining
light amongst English Dissenters, writes in a
melancholy strain to the effect that the present
Sunday-school system has been a failure, whereas
every close observer of such matters knows that it
has proved an unqualified success up to now.
Without Sunday-schools life would be a dreary
waste for hundreds of meek-eyed young females,
and weak-kneed young men, who find a bond of
sympathy in the interesting legend of Jonah and
the Whale. Ruth and Obadiah look on Bible*
classes as stepping-stones to the courtship which
begins in long walks home together, and
occasionally culminates in a spicy “maintenance ”
case. Being both of a nervous, blushful, retiring
disposition they would die of suppressed love bub
for the blessed opportunities of touching one
another’s tingling fingers when they borrow Bibles
or exchange bundles of tracts, or both push up the
school-rpom window at the same time, at which
ecstatic moments they always maintain a sickly
appearance of innocence and breathe hard. For
these young people. Sunday-schools, with the
picnics appertaining thereto, serve as outlets for
sanctified giddiness, just as balls and carpet-
dances fill a long-felt want in more earthly circles.
Ruth’s secret yearning for the masculine hug is
every bit as strong as that of her frivolous cousin
Ethel, but whilst the latter likes a gentle squeezing
to the accompaniment of dance-music, the former
prefers that Obadiah shall hum a hymn-tune
during the ceremony. So Ruth takes a Sunday-
school class, and in due course Obadiah comes
along, in a hesitating sort of way, with his first
kiss of Christian love. Even if the osculation be
only of a brotherly character it gets there all the
same. Apart from the opportunities they offer for
full-grown mashing, Sunday-schools are of inestim-
able benefit to the children. The missionary-box
is a grand institution for enabling little Tommy
to substitute hardbake for heathen when dis-
bursing his Sabbath penny. “Be sure you put it
in the box, Tommy,” says his confiding mother.
He does put the penny in the slot and gets a cake
of toffee in return. Sometimes he gets a cigarette.
Under cover of attending Sunday-school, the
little innocents of both sexes acquire general
knowledge at an appalling rate, and as for real fun
—why the pantomime, the bad, unregenerate pan-
tomime, is a fool to the orgies that take place in
the Church grounds. Sunday-schools a failure I
Reynolds must be getting at us.

What we are Prepared to do
"We are prepared to supply 100,000 of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A Word of Advice.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Read our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or yours need or would be benefited
by the use of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
complexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation,
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the«\v eakest person may take them with-
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
Why do we take this Risk?
This is what people ask us. We reph , because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimnation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
Do I need them ?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease.
If you have Constipation, Yes. They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. . They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward off Typhoid and all other infectious and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price Is. 6d., (post free, Is. Bd.), and are for sale
by most Chemists and Storekeepers throughout Australasia.

Robert Buchanan on Parnell’s Adultery.
Robert Buchanan thus addresses London
Echo on the Parnell-O’Shea case in a letter-
headed “ The Journalist in Absolution ” :—
Writing neither as a person having authority,
nor as one of the scribes, I wish to put on record,
if you will permit me, my complete and absolute
sympathy with Mr. Parnell. He may, or may
not, be an adulterer, —that in any case, I con-
sider a detail, chiefly interesting to himself ; but I
contend that his technical and legal guilt is no
proof whatever of his moral turpitude. No ques-
tion involving the relation of the sexes can be ab-
solutely decided in the tainted atmosphere of our
foul Divorce Court, and the case of “O’Shea v.
Parnell ” was established by the unworthiest of all
evidence, that of prying chambermaids, prurient
lodging-house keepers, and all the miserable
human fry who swim in the unclean shallows of
the legal puddle. To my mind, Mr. Parnell’s
stern and absolute silence, his determination not
to be dragged through the obscene mire, is nega-
tive evidence in his favour. He has chosen, likea
strong man, to let the blow fall on his own
shoulders, and the result is that Mrs. O’Shea has
been spared and almost forgotten, while all the
moral wolves are clamouring for Mr. Parnell’s
blood. But even if Mr. Parnell is guilty no man
can tell in what degree. That, as 1 have said, is
a matter chiefly concerning himself. What con-
cerns us, men who stand as simple spectators of a
persecution unparalleled in the history of politics,
is the means which are being adopted to hound a
great man out of public life.
It is on record, I believe—or at any rate it has
been stated —that immediately after the decision
of the Divorce Court a well-known journalist
waited upon Mr. Parnell and informed him that
unless.full “confession” was made at once and
the leadership of the Irish party simultaneously
resigned, the said journalist would appeal to the
Puritans of England to “let loose the dogs” of
moral War. Whether threatened or not, the
thing has been done, and Mr. Parnell has been
hunted down, not by honest public opinion, not
by British virtue, not even by the British Matron,
but by the Journalism of the sewers on the one
side and the Journalism of the back-kitchen on
the other. For whence chiefly arises this
ferocious clamour of prurient morality, this talk
about the sanctity of the household, and the
eternal symbolism of the bed-post ? Firstly, from
the source out of which arose the publication of a
scandal so infamous, and described so imfamously,
that the very air of Nature was polluted as by a
cesspool, the stench of which penetrated like
poison into every household of the land.
Secondly, from the individual who invented the
journalism of Paul Pry, who has violated
all the privileges of social life, while haunt-
ing the back-kitchens of the aristocracy,
and counting the candle-ends of the govern-
ing classes; and who, finally, proposed not
long ago, in the Commons, to the manifest satis-
faction of a crowd of fellow-demagogues, to pol-
lute the ears of his fellow-members by opening up
in broad day the sewer of another foul and loath-
some scandal. The other attacks on the character
of the member for Cork may be set aside as purely
political. The attacks to which I draw attention
are specifically “ moral.” It is the latter to which
I wish to confine your attention, while demanding
whether we are to substitute for the espionage of
the old and discredited priesthoods the espionage
of the Journalist in Absolution ?
No “Confessional Unmasked ” has yet, to my
mind, furnished so sad an illustration of human
prurience as the new Confessional of the Journal.
Manifold as are the injuries which Journalism in
general has done to society, to literature, and to
art, by fostering the uninstruction of the general
reader, and parodying the ephemeral judgments
of'the hour, those injuries are small to the crimes
committed by the Journalism which masquerades
in the guise of Morality, which deals in household
garbage, and, in the interests of vulgar curiosity,
institutes a Public Confessional. Dismal, indeed,
is the lot of the human being who, like Mr. Par-
nell, sits in the confession-box, with the Priest of
Prurience on one side and the Priest of Espionage
on the other. If he refuses, as Mr. Parnell has
done, to make any kind of utterance, woe to him
and to his generation ! The flood-gates of denun-
ciation are opened ; the whole army of back-
kitchen moralists and scandal-mongers is arrayed
against him ; the standard of the Cross is raised,
and men prepare for the luxury of the auto da ft.
Honest citizens bar their doors, and peep from
their window's in terror. Everywhere, ushered by
the newsboy with his “latest edition,” w T alk the
agents of the Inquisition.
To most men who would live their lives in peace
Journalism is merely Babbage’s Organ in the
Street: they stop their ears, and try to think and
work in spite of it. But to all men who value the
security of their homes and the right of private
judgment the New Journalism, with its aggression,
its tyrannical bias, and its shameless indecency,
is the old Priest in Absolution forcing a way into
every household. Tartuffe and Melchior live
again in the columns of the inquisitorial news-
paper, while the Soapin of Politics walks hand in
hand with the Mawworm of Morality. At this
moment, therefore, when a wave of prurient Puri-
tanism is rising higher and higher to destroy all
that makes the world sweet and wholesome, it is
with no common interest that we who are neither
inquisitorial nor “ moral ” watch the fate of Mr.
Parnell. If he stands like a rock, refusing to be
doomed by the Divorce Court, and defying the
clamour of penny-a-Hning Pharisees, there is still
hope for Society. If he falls, bestrade! led over
by the rampant Journalist in Absolution, wo
who loathe his would-be Confessors may well
despair. I shall say nothing here of his
public services, of his power and prescience as
the one man capable of interpreting the hopes
and wishes of the Irish race; nothing of the
constitutional bigotry which has led even so honest
a man as Mr. Gladstone to join in the cry against
him. It should be remembered, nevertheless,
that Mr. Parnell retains his position not because
he is privately virtuous, but because he is politi-
cally puissant, and that Mr. Gladstone, despite
all his noble disinterestedness, is a retrograde
moralist, who repudiates Divorce under any cir-
cumstances, and founds his repudiation on the
diseased ravings of mediaeval monks and saints.
I for one believe that issues far deeper than any
issues merely political will be determined by the
ultimate position of Mr. Parnell. I for one refuse
to accept the discredited disclosures of the Divorce
Court and the obscene comments of the Journalist
in Absolution as any final test of human life and
character. —I am, &c.,
Robert Buchanan.

The gentle, forgiving soul of woman
asserted itself lately in the Auckland police-court.
A stout, middle-aged lady was called by the police
as a witness in a larceny-case. She came up
rather reluctantly, and kissed the Scripture- with
the air of a person tackling an uncongenial job,
and then a bright idea seemed to cross her intel-
lect for she smiled a great, happy smile, and fired
the Bible straight at the nearest lawyer's head.
He had just time tobobdown as the missile grazed
his ear, and broke its back against the opposite
wall, and then a brawny officer rushed forward
and seized the bearer of evidence, and the word
of Truth was picked up and dusted, and the court
adjourned.

lines. As it is not a question of profit, but rather
one of convenience, we are beginning to feel tired.
Of course it is not the correct thing to study tiro
'■convenience of one person or batch of individuals,
but where the interests of a large body of indivi-
duals are concerned, provided that the State does
not unduly favour one section of the community
at the expense of another, it is morally bound to
afford all its members similar means of transit
regardless of primary cost.
'1 he yearly increment on the London
rental (cap tal value) is over four-and-a-half
millions. This increase, of course, in site-value
only, and in no way dependent on individual im-
provement of buildings, is a communally-produced
value,.unearned by the landlords who pocket it.
The houses of London are worth, it is supposed,
£212,000,000 ; the land .on which they stand is
estimated at £418,000,000. On the latter sum the
landlords receive about £17,100,000 annually as
rent, and year by year, under the leasehold sys-
tem, the houses fall into their hands.
One of the neatest bits of shuffling lately
performed by Premier Parkes was that reply to
Premier Munro on the Booth “ In Darkest Eng-
land ” question. Asked to state his intentions
with regard to the reception his Government
would afford to the threatened swarm of British
refuse, he returned that having carefully read the
book he felt convinced that the colony referred to
by the General mpst be Africa, not Australia,
and hence there was no need to discuss the matter
at present. This is the return snub for that little
reply of Dunky’s on the “ Australia ” vice “New
South Wales ” circular.
A pure spirit—-Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Melbourne Age says, with all apparent
seriousness “ It is well known that several
members of the Cabinet strongly disapprove of
the action of the late Government in undertaking
to bear the cost of the Premier Building Associa-
tion prosecutions.” Considering that at least
three personal friends of the Cabinet wei’e prose-
cuted (one of them having been convicted), and
that a very near relation of the present Premier
was included in the celebrated “abandoned
charge,” there doesn’t seem much trouble about
accounting for the presence of so much milk of
human kindness in the Government cocoa-nut.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—look for £1 orders.
The papers which are creating such a dust
because Parnell declines to give way to Gladstone
would do well to remember that Parnell never
sought the alliance with Gladstone —it was Glad-
stone who sought Parnell, and presumably he did
it for his own purposes. Consequently, if Glad-
stone goes the party will only have lost an acci-
dental ally ; if Parnell goes it will have lost the
man who created it, and made it what it is. The
man who borrowed Home Rule seeks to bounce
the man who made it, and is wildly surprised to
find that the latter refuses to regard himself as a
mere secondary party in the transaction.
Wolfe’s Schnapps will do you no harm.
Ex-Gov. darington’s “For Ever,” in his
prediction about the esto perpelua of Australian
subjection to England, is like Munro’s never-
forgotten “Never, never, never!” when he de-
clared the stone wall would never give way before
the iron hand —yet it did. But Carington
only speaks like Carlyle’s Chancellor in the
“French Revolution.” He used to gyrate and
gyrate, and say “ it will last my time.” That is
the meaning of for ever—“ after me the Deluge.”
What cares Carington about the time when his
barouche no longer conveys him to the Marl-
borough ? What has posterity done for us - the
peerage ? Why, it’s our destruction.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—the ladies appreciate it,
Under the circumstances of the Behring
Strait difficulty, it is interesting to know
that last year the United States Govern-
ment resolved that, instead of a comparatively
insignificant fleet, there should be an array of new
ships costing £55,000,000 sterling—the entire pro-
gramme comprising 227 vessels, including 10 battle-
ships of 10,000 tons; 28 second-class ironclads,
G000 to 8000 tons ; 7 monitors, 3600 to 6000 tons ;
10 rams, 3500 tons; 35 very fast cruisers, 3500 to
7000 tons ; 6 cruisers, 1700 to 3200 tons ; 10 gun-
boats, 16 torpedo-catchers, 101 torpedo-boats.
Secretary Tracy writes, in his Annual Report for
this year : “The defence of the U.S. absolutely
requires the creation of a fighting force.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps cheers the mind and body.
Ingenious , anagrams formed from the
names of the seven African bandits, viz., Stanley,
Jephson, Barttelot, Ward, Jameson, Troup and
Bonny,—who are so closely connected with the
Rear-Guard scandals :—
“ Nasty job apparently. Just now one rids blame on
t’other.”
“ Absent men’s honour in jeopardy just now. O paltry
battle! ”
“ Apparently the snob-trot journey to Emin was an
£ s. d. job.”

Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Medical and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century. '

piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck. The several

icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves,jßrain and Muscles,infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments: —
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Fever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost
every form of Aches and Pains,

while teething. Illustrated Circular sent free, giving

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
