Six good reasons why you
should own a Rover
1. Rover is a very lively machine. Driv-
ing in city traffic is deceptively smooth
and docile. But Rover has great re-
serves of power. Top speed is more
than 100 mph. The three-litre motor
develops 129 horsepower-you cruise
at 80 all day. Overdrive is standard
equipment. You may choose between
a fully automatic transmission or a
more sporting four-speed synchromesh
handshift.
2. Rover is exceedingly comfortable.
The lack of fatigue over long distances
is quite remarkable. You relax in fully
adjustable seats deeply upholstered in
hides of the finest English leather. The
spaciousness, thick pile carpeting and
luxury appointments add to your com-
fort and pleasure. Door arm-rests also
adjust to suit your fancy. Noise and
vibration rarely intrude, even at high
speeds.
3. Rover’s attention to finish is a mat-
ter of record. The paintwork, for in-
stance, is sprayed with five hand-
rubbed coats of special enamel. Hand-
polished African cherry is inlaid on
fascia and window trims. The simple
classic lines change very little from
year to year. (An international gold
medal has been awarded for coach-
work.)
4. Rover Is also a very safe car. Big
servo-assisted disc and shoe brakes
need only a touch to dissolve even the
highest speeds. Safety padding, wind-
screen washers and tamper-proof locks
all add to your feeling of well-being.
Vision is excellent. A superbly engin-
eered suspension gives you the kind
of smooth road-holding and handling
you'd expect from the men who de-
signed and produced the gas-turbine
cars.
5. An air of quiet luxury is to be found
throughout the entire car. Heating and
demisting equipment is built-in. You’ll
also find a courtesy light above each
door. Two-level ventilation for each
person. There’s even a hidden nest of
tools. A reserve fuel supply. And S
switch to tell you the oil level in the
motor. Sound absorbing underlays,
rubber body mounts, and thick under-
body sealing keep out dust and ex-
traneous noise.
6. Parts and service are not expensive.
A network of specially chosen dealers
will do everything to keep you happy
with your Rover-long after you’ve
bought it. Rover has earned a reputa-
tion for being one of the best engin-
eered motor cars in the world. It is
designed to be driven and enjoyed
long after many ordinary cars have
been discarded. Your investment will
in fact cost less to maintain than most
others, regardless of price.
There are many more exciting aspects
to this fine car. If you would like
the pleasant experience of discovering
them for yourself, please write or tele-
phone. We’ll send a Rover to your door.

National Notebook
The Night People
T ast year it was the cult of the surfie
—this year the cult of what West
Australians have called “the night
people”. And if they were mystified by
the urge which drove their young in
quest of the perfect wave, they have been
appalled at stories about carloads of
bored teenagers, cruising all night look-
ing for excitement and usually finding it
in speed.
A new word has become part of the
West Australian vocabulary: “Drag”,
meaning a challenge and acceptance to
compete, usually in souped-up cars in
the middle of the night on a remote road.
“Most of the drags are to see who can
take the curves and corners best, not
just on speed.” This refinement to the
definition is from 17-year-old Andrew
Dekens, one of six injured survivors of
a crash which killed two teenagers last
month in Perth’s King’s Park.
The park, which has a 20 mph speed
limit, has always been a favorite necking
spot. But drag races have added a new
dimension of danger. The proprietor of
a late-roster service station points out
how speed and often drink are catalysts
for the eternal craving for kicks: “The
strange thing about these kids is that
though there were so many of them in
this crowd (of six cars which pulled up
together for refuelling), they were polite
and well-behaved while I served them.
Yet as soon as they started their cars
they became barbarians again. You
"What are you going to say about that in
your book?"
could hear them speeding a mile away.”
He pointed out, too, that the young-
sters had to hand round the hat tc scrape
tip enough to satisfy their big cars’
appetite for petrol. This has brought
about a refinement to the car-milking
technique new to the West. They take
about a gallon at a time from a number
of cars, undetected late at night, and
usually the owner never misses it.
Few adults come in contact with the
night people, but those who do are bitter
towards them. A mild young traffic cop
on accident patrol admits: “I feel no
sympathy when they’re hurt or even
killed. But I get very angry when they
hurt other people.” His temporary
solution would be to round them up and
take them to view the carnage of other
crashes. “It might slow them down at
least for a month or two,” he says. “But
it wouldn’t last. Speed is their god. The
shock would wear off.”
Similarly, a Perth surgeon often called
to crashes is unsympathetic even to those
hurt. He claims that between 40 and
50 per cent of the young crash victims
admitted to hospital were drunk on
arrival and dodged arrest only because
of their injuries. He says blood tests for
alcohol should be allowed without the
patient’s permission.
A Walter Mitty Thing
Tn the shadow of his armor, which
■*" leant against the wall of the dressing-
room like a collapsed sentry, Paul Dane-
man talked to us about his much-praised
role as King Arthur in Williamson’s pro-
duction of “Camelot”, now playing at
Her Majesty’s in Sydney. Mr Daneman
bows out of the cast on November 21
and another English actor Michael Mur-
ray takes over.
“King Arthur was obviously written
with Richard Burton’s type of actor in
mind,” Daneman said, “and once he had
undertaken to play it, the part was bent
towards him a bit. Because of this there
is a tendency, whenever ‘Camelot’ is
done, to look for somebody with the
same background as an English classical
actor. I suppose I got the part through
an association of ideas.
“No,” he said. “I’d never sung before.
It was one of my Walter Mitty things
to sing, though when I actually got to
it the prospect was a bit alarming. I
took a crash course before I came out.”
Daneman off-stage, with his clean-cut
look and big horn-rimmed glasses, has
the air of a young doctor coming up with
a cheerful diagnosis. He is in his late
thirties, but seems less. He told us that
A Real Find
VT ineteen-year-old Suzanne Holly
Jones crossed her seamless-stock-
inged legs as she clasped her coke and
leaned her upright chair back against the
\all of her Hotel Australia bedroom in
jlydney. “The piece my publisher has
written about me on the dust jacket of
my novel does say I love hamburgers
and drive-in movies,” she agreed, toying
with a long wisp of reddish-brown hair.
“But that’s not to say I love them as a
diet. I think they're marvellous to
relax in, or with, as the case may be.”
Miss Jones was in Sydney for the
launching of her first novel, “Harry’s
Child”, published by Jacaranda Press. Mr
Brian Clouston of Jacaranda, hovering
nearby in shirtsleeves, said Suzanne was
>a real find. Judith Wright has already
described her as “a born writer”. We
asked Miss Jones how long she had
been writing. “Ever since I can remem-
ber. I read a lot, too. Yes, I have a
-favorite author William Golding. I
thought Lord Of The Flies was marvel-
lous.”
I Confirming that she lives in Melbourne,
she pointed out that her home at East
Hawthorn, where she lives with her
parents, three sisters and one brother, is
not in the best part of Hawthorn. “I
know some young people who think it’s
I wonderful to live in a really disreputable
part of town, though. You know, Carl-
son and all that. But I don’t really go for
that way-out stuff.” We asked her to
paraphase “way-out”. She refused a
cigarette and thought. “I would say 'deli-
berately non-conformist’ is what I mean
by that,” she said finally. “Pretence,
pretension, all that.” Pretension is one
,of Miss Jones’s favorite words.
According to the potted biography on
her book’s rear cover her dislikes include
worldly attitudes and unworldly people.
“By that I mean people who like to look
like what they want to be but don’t do
the things necessary to justify that. Pre-
hension all the way. I loathe it. Ugh!”
Matriculated from Huntingtower, the
Christian Science co-ed school in Mel-
bourne, she says her religion holds no
problems for her but her doubts are now
about herself. Emotionally, she added,
she achieves great satisfaction from work-
ing with spastic children, which she does
more or less full time at Melbourne’s
Lady Herring Day Centre. She agrees
that perhaps this is selfish labor (because
she enjoys it so) but adds that it is “in-
tensely rewarding”.
Her Sagan-length novel (20,000 words)
explores the sensitive relationship between
a girl and her foster-father, Mr Clouston
told us. Asked what she would most
like critics to write about it, Miss Jones
told us only: “I don’t care if it takes me
until lam 101 but I am working towards
the category of ‘brilliant’.” Before we
left she added that she has always pre-
ferred older people “not much older,
but older” and dislikes the pretensions
of some young people today.

"Camelot” was the longest run of his
career. “The sort of thing I was in
before was usually a succes d’estime or
>de scandale,” he said. “I was a bit
worried about this one, but somehow I
haven’t dried up on it completely,
i “Arthur’s a difficult part; you can’t do
it mechanically; you’ve got to sustain a
Jot of the reality of the show. And
liometimes in the scene at the end with
'the little boy I can still get the original
/feeling. Of course, you get more relaxed
with time, and even the music grows on
you; but it’s been a jolly tiring show
the changes are exhausting .”
On the prospects of live theatre in
.Australia, Daneman was, as he said, not
‘terribly sanguine. He thought the little
theatres were the best hope of keeping
things going. What worried him, he
said, was that there were so few engage-
ments for actors here. “Even if you get
to the top, how often do you work?”
, He thought that increased local television
ycould subsidise the theatre by providing
employment, and that it would help the
Australian situation if television actors
overseas demanded more for replay
rights.
Daneman said he regarded acting a 9
a craft, not an art; actors should be
'happy to practise it anywhere. “Audi-
lences today are used to television—-
they’re not so responsive in the theatre
as they used to be,” he said. “Sometimes
when I’m in a theatre I long to be doing
it in a television studio, where you get
absolute concentration and silence, and
.can get on with the job without having
to worry whether they can hear you at
Ithe back, or if somebody’s going to
cough on the key line. “Consequently,”
he said, “I’m not so bothered myself
about the live theatre. This business of
‘playing to an audience’ is not so im-
portant as people make out.”
Poster Art
FVne of Sydney’s harmless lunchtime
diversions is studying the posters of
the two afternoon papers, “The Sun” and
the “Daily Mirror”, and trying to guess
what lies behind their urgent abbrevia-
tions. Afternoon papers everywhere
’develop techniques which they hope will
make their voice heard over the clamor
of a big city going about its business.
But in Sydney the frantic competition
between the two papers is establishing
new heights, or depths, in poster art.
If you want to play this guessing game,
try yourself with these three “Daily
Mirror posters:
1. PHOTO: BEACH BEAUTY
BANNED.
2. ETHEL MERMAN CHARGED.
3. VICAR WITH NUDE MODEL,
PHOTO.
If your guesses are along the lines that
No. 1 refers to a picture of a bathing-
girl who has been banned from a beach,
No. 2 means that Ethel Merman has
been charged by police with an offence
during her Sydney night-club season,
and No. 3 that inside the paper is a pic-
ture of a clergyman with a nude model,
you have failed miserably.
The beach beauty poster referred to a
London story about an MP suggesting
in the Commons that BOAC should im-
prove the moral standard of its advertise-
ments. The picture accompanying the
story was a reproduction of an advertise-
ment, showing a girl in a bikini lying on
a beach. The “Ethel Merman charged”
poster was accompanied by a story from
America, published while Miss Merman
was in Sydney. It told how her husband,
Ernest Borgnine, alleged in their divorce
action that she was mentally cruel to
him. This throws an entirely new light
on “charged”.
The “Vicar with nude model” was
about the vicar of a church in England
who had condemned an advertisement
issued by the British Safety Council,
which showed a scantily-dressed woman.
The photo showed the vicar and the
model, fully clothed, meeting to discuss
his objections.
But here are posters which have man-
aged to stump the experts during 1964:

MR WETHERELL’S PREDECESSORS
80 Years Ago: November 15, 1884.
Much clamor continues to be made
about the necessity for religious
instruction in the Public Schools of
the colony. We conceive that the con-
tention which is going on regarding
this might be put an end to, could
the opposing parties but agree to a
definition of what is, essentially, re-
ligious instruction. There really exists
common ground, amply to accommo-
date all parties. It will be universally
conceded that whatever instruction
trains the young to practice truth-
fulness, pitifulness, and integrity is
distinctly religious. Now. it requires'
no revelation from Heaven to convince
the uncorrupted mind of childhood
that truthfulness is noble, that charity
is elevating and that integrity is
splendid. These are all natural truths
to which every sound mind not
corrupted by evil habits responds
instinctively. There needs neither the
sanction of supernatural revelation
nor the lurid terrors of a horrible Hell
to induce young people to believe, to
the very bottom of their hearts, that
these things are of eternal verity, and
that to neglect them is to court self-
contempt and deformity of soul.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Taking Mr Calwell Seriously?
i lthough the Federal Government’s
j** defence review represents an
ihistoric first step, it is important to
/emphasise that it is only a first step.
As Dr T. B. Millar points out on page
24 of this issue, too many of the
decisions are decisions to investigate
something: the Army, for example, will
investigate low - level anti - aircraft
l weapons and new artillery weapons,
' but we do not know when, if at all,
we will buy them or make them our-
selves. More importantly, many of the
other decisions—concerning national
service, an RAAF deterrent, the Navy’s
missiles, the Army’s transports will
. not take practical effect for anything
from 18 months to three years. In
other words, the real sense of urgency
is still lacking.
Further, the Government unfortu-
nately said nothing about one in-
creasingly grave problem—the bureau-
cratisation of defence. At present,
civilian bureaucratic controllers are
tending, despite themselves, to under-
mine the morale of the services by
imposing decisions on the military
professionals without serious regard to
military advice. Treasury, for example,
controls not only total expenditure—
as it should but the detailed spend-
ing of an approved appropriation,
especially in matters of training and
personnel.
Nevertheless, the Defence Review
means the Government has acknow-
ledged most of what has to be done,
and, as overseas reactions indicate,
Australians need no longer feel they
are regarded as parasites on their allies.
As for Mr Arthur Calwell’s attack
on the Government, it is one of the
ironies of his career that he usually
gives his better speeches on subjects
where no one takes him seriously.
How can one, when he leads a party
which is on record as opposing
SEATO and the Exmouth Gulf base,
and wanting to withdraw our troops
from Malaya; which believes in
demoralising our Asian allies by recog-
nising Red China; and which has, as
one of its leading spokesmen, Dr J. F.
Cairns, who wrote the other day that:
“We [in the ALP] are situated in the
political spectrum next to the Com-
munists and they will stand for many
things for which we also stand. We
cannot, therefore, oppose those things.”
Before Mr Calwell can fight an
election on a programme of reforming
our defences with any hope of success,
he clearly had better reform his own
party. Needless to say, he will not. The
Left wing, which arouses so much
public contempt, has too strong a con-
trol over the party machine which
controls Mr Calwell.
“Undue Emphasis on Sex”
judicial decisions last week
indicate that Sydney’s recent wave
of censorship prosecutions may be
ebbing. The major one was Judge
Levine’s quashing of the convictions
and fines imposed by a magistrate on
four students and the printer of the
University of NSW student paper
“Tharunka”. In his judgment he
made two important points. Firstly, he
pointed out that although, in obscenity
cases, the courts had to take into
account the likely recipients of a publi-
cation, this did not mean that every
remotely possible recipient had to be
considered. In other words, students
at least are now legally entitled to
publish the sort of material that
students traditionally do publish in a
free society.
Secondly, Judge Levine clarified the
concept, introduced some years ago,
of “undue emphasis on sex” as a test
of obscenity. This concept has never
been wholly clear, and its meaning has
differed from State to State. Judge
Levine, adopting a High Court ruling
in a Queensland case, argued that it
has practically no meaning at all if
detached from the traditional test of
“tendency to deprave and corrupt”.
Otherwise, a vast range of publica-
tions, which have, in ordinary usage,
an “undue emphasis on sex” but which
contemporary society accepts as a
“normally” undue emphasis, would
have to be banned with absurd
results. Closely following this decision
was a magistrate’s rejection of a
Crown case against a magazine called
“Pleasure”, because however much the
magazine emphasised sex, it had no
tendency to corrupt.
If decisions of this sort are main-
tained, the recent outbreak of censor-
ship will be seen as a temporary
aberration of an otherwise rational
community.
Academic Pay
f PHE recent increases in academic
salaries (ranging from £6OO to
£lOOO for professors, readers and
associate professors), which were
recommended by Mr Justice Eggles-
ton and accepted by the Federal
Government, are by no means objec-
tionable in themselves. They do, how-
ever, raise a basic policy question.
They assume that the way to attract
good professors is to pay them more.
But as Professor Armstrong of Sydney
University points out in a letter on
page 47, this may be a mistaken policy.
What attracts good staff is not neces-
sarily, he claims, more money, but
better conditions for work (i.e., re-
search and teaching). Since this is
obviously the case in other walks of
life, especially business, there seems
no reason to doubt it is true in
academic life.
Even where salaries are of para-
mount importance, the Eggleston ap-
proach may be misguided. Tradition-
ally all Australian professors are paid
equally, because it is thought unequal
salaries would undermine the ideal of
an academic community. This means
that in the fields for which inter-
national competition is keen, Aus-
tralian universities even with reason-
ably increased salaries, will not attract
sufficient staff because overseas uni-
versities, notably in America, pay the
“market wage”, far higher than Aus-
tralian universities can afford. Rather
than channelling resources away from,
for example, libraries, in the vain
hope of keeping up with the inter-
national market, it may be wiser to
abandon the traditional policy of
equal salaries for all professors and
allow certain departments to pay more
in order to attract the best men, while
still leaving more money for invest-
ment in conditions.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Anti-Conscription Election
6i l trill go from city to city . .
CANBERRA Prime Minister Sir
Robert Menzies last week made it a
certainty that the Senate election cam-
paign would be fought on either de-
fence or conscription, or both, after he
brought down the Government’s review
of defence which provided for the larg-
est defence expansion in Australia’s
peace-time history involving conscrip-
tion for selected 20-year-olds.
The Opposition Leader, Mr A. Cal-
well, made it a double certainty. He
told Parliament “the Prime Minister has
thrown down the gauntlet and I accept
it gladly. In the forthcoming campaign
my colleagues and I will go from city to
city, from town to town, throughout the
length and breadth of this continent,
with one aim. We will tell the people
of the true state of the defences of this
nation —how the Government is trifling
with the lives of their sons in an at-
tempt to cover up its deficiencies.”
Sir Robert Menzies undoubtedly
wanted the Labor Party to pick up the
gauntlet and to agree to fight the com-
ing Senate elections on conscription. He
believes that the voters generally either
recognise, or on reflection, will recog-
nise the national need for the conscrip-
tion scheme to build up the army.
But Calwell, while he picked up the
gauntlet, did not precisely agree to fight
the elections on conscription. What he
said was that he would fight the elec-
tions on defence. To draw this distinc-
tion between the aims of the two men
may seem at first glance oversubtle.
But there is a real distinction. If Sir
Robert can make the issue conscription,
Labor will approach the election cam-
paign emotionally, and emotion in poli-
tics usually leads to mistakes in judg-
ment, wild statements and gives a party
an aura of desperate irresponsibility that,
properly exploited—and Menzies is a
master of this particular form of ex-
ploitation—can bring the Party disaster
at the polls.
There is a high emotional content in
conscription for the Labor Party. The
word itself has its own mystique. Tt
split the Party wide open in the 1914-18
War, and left scars that were still not
completely healed when the first post-
war Labor Government—that led by Mr
Scullin—was elected to Federal power
in 1929. It became a Party tradition
and a Party reaction, and “no conscrip-
tion for overseas service” became a
slogan as deeply ingrained in Labor
thinking as “the right to strike”.
Again in World War 11, conscription
came perilously close to splitting the
Party as disastrously when Mr Calwell,
then a relatively minor figure in the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, led
a campaign against the conscription pro-
posal sponsored by the then Prime Min-
ister, John Curtin, with the justification
that Australia was under perceptible im-
mediate threat from the advancing
Japanese. Curtin won that fight but
only just and as it was even, he with his
power prestige and influence had to
acknowledge the strength of Labor senti-
ment on this question by restricting the
area for conscripted service to a limited
geographical area to Australia’s north.
The Menzies move for peace-time
conscription may be justified militarily
"These boys with not only their careers
but possibly their lives at stake are to be
selected by some form of lottery or Rus-
sian Roulette . . ."
—ARTHUR CALWELL
and by the international situation, but
Menzies the Prime Minister is also
Menzies the politician, an old dog at the
political game who is not averse to tak-
ing advantage of circumstances to help
him win an election. Menzies knew
when he introduced compulsory selec-
tive service that the Labor Party was
certain to oppose it, particularly com-
posed as it is at present and with Mr
Calwell its Federal Leader. If Calwell
opposed conscription for overseas ser-
vice of mature men in war-time, con-
sistency demanded that he should op-
pose the conscription for overseas ser-
vice of 20-year-olds in peace-time.
In deciding upon compulsory national
service at this time Menzies was prob-
ably doing what he thought was best
for Australia’s defence but he must also
have known that in making such a deci-
sion he was putting in a hawk among
Labor's already widely scattered and
A. CALWELL
arguing chickens, and that with the
Senate elections coming up he and his
Party could possibly benefit from the
Labor panic to the extent of winning
three States and retaining for his Gov-
ernment its majority in the Senate. Cal-
well’s speech last week showed that he
realised what Menzies was after and was
out to prevent him achieving his end.
Calwell clearly showed that he realised
he would have less chance of winning an
anti-conscription fight in peace-time,
when emotions would not be so deeply
involved but when there was significant
public uneasiness about the state of Aus-
tralia’s defences, than in winning a
straightout defence fight.
There were understandably emotional
overtones to Calwell’s speech. He would
have been inhuman if there had been
none and his personal history in two
conscription campaigns was such that he
could not be completely impersonal.
“These boys with not only their careers
but possibly their lives at stake are to
be selected by some form of lottery or
Russian Roulette . . . when it is pro-
posed as the Government does now to
conscript one in 30 of the boys elegible
each year, rank injustice is piled upon
utter folly.” But recognising the danger
in emotionalism, and for once keeping
himself tightly disciplined, Calwell kept
coming back to what he wanted to fight
the Senate elections on defence. He
put his finger neatly on some of the
weaknesses in the Prime Minister’s
speech.
In the first four of the Prime Minister's
17-page speech Sir Robert emphasised the
urgency of the situation and the deter-
ioration in Australia’s strategic position,
vis-a-vis the Asian area to its north in
recent months. But after that
Menzies itemised decisions, none
of which outside the conscription one
would produce a result before 1967 and
most of which would not produce a
result until 1970. Things were unsatis-


factory so that the Menzies Government’s
idea of correcting the position was not
to provide a new strike carrier as advo-
cated by Labor, in its 1963 election pro-
posals, but to withdraw the carrier Mel-
bourne from service for two years while
it was modernised. He pointed out that
jlast year 23,000 volunteered for the
permanent forces while only 6,300 were
accepted. Would the same standard of
Rejection be applied to the conscripts?
I In my view the treasurer, Harold Holt,
who followed Calwell in the debate, paid
a tribute to the workmanlike nature of
his speech from the Opposition’s view-
point by counter-attacking instead of
merely defending the Government’s
-proposals. In effect, said Holt, whatever
can be said against the Government,
Labor could not be entrusted as an
alternative with Australia’s defence. Its
interest in national defence was suspic-
iously new-found. It’s speakers’ notes for
the 1961 election did not even mention
; the word defence. Its leaders for years
have been standing up in the Parliament
demanding a reduction in the defence
vote. Which wing of Labor would be in
control if Labor was returned as a
Government? The debate made it clear
that while either conscription or defence,
or both will be the Senate election
issues Menzies would prefer it to be a
clear-cut fight on conscription and Cal-
well would prefer it to be the wider
and more confusing issue of defence
generally.
ALAN REID
NATIONAL SERVICE 1916 ... FROM THE BULLETIN, OCTOBER 12. 1916.
THE ARMY
The World of Vietcong
In Looking Glass Land
SAIGON Twenty miles out of
Saigon the road was still busy. Two
crowded buses splashed by, then a military
jeep carrying an American officer, then
three Army trucks crammed with steel-
helmeted troops. My companion stopped
the car at a corner. “Walk 200 yards
down that side lane,” he said softly, “and
you are in a different world the world
of the Vietcong.” Two days later a task
force of Communist guerrillas set up
six mortars nearby and in half an hour
destroyed or damaged 27 aircraft in-
cluding 20 857 American jet bombers—
parked on Great Bien Hoa Air Base,
1-H miles away. To many in the outside
world this seemed a new and intolerable
provocation, almost a declaration of war.
But war is already on, the Americans
are already in it, and the target and de-
gree of destruction do not alter the basic
nature of the operation. Moreover, given
the sloppy security at the Base and the
lack of protection for the planes, there
was nothing astonishing in its boldness to
the Vietnamese who last month saw the
Communist flag flown impertinently by
the Vietcong for 48 hours over a village
not nine miles from the capital.
Four years ago, when the Communist
guerrilla war against the “pro-Western”
Saigon administration began to look seri-
ous, it was easy to see it conventionally
in the mind’s eye as a somewhat untidy
struggle between Government forces and
armed rebels for mastery of the steaming
swamps, flooded paddy fields and jungle-
matted mountains of South Vietnam. But
today South Vietnam is a disturbing,
equivocal land of optical illusion. It re-
quires a mental squint to visualise the
conflict, for it is often as if the Viet-
cong were only on the other side of
the looking glass. One village has a head-
man appointed by the Government. The
district chief visits it regularly, it is
guarded by a squad of the paramilitary
“popular force”. It has medicines from
the provincial capital, a hidden telephone
for emergency contact with the Army,
three-day-old Saigon newspapers and
sometimes American aid in the shape of
a lorry-load of cotton cloth or a starry-
eyed official with an addiction for teach-
ing mildly-surprised peasants how to
build windmills.
The next village across the flat rice-
fields is mainly run by a lean-cheeked
young man in a buttoned-up denim
tunic and slacks, and a plastic topee with
a red star on the front. Behind him is
the Communist - dominated “National
Liberation Front of South Vietnam”
whose fighting arm is the Vietcong guer-
rilla army of more than 30,000 regulars,
supported by about 85,000 regional
troops and auxiliaries. It has a propa-
ganda centre where anti-American rallies
are held and leaflets condemning the
Saigon Government distributed. The Lib-
eration Front and the Vietcong defend
the inhabitants, indoctrinate them, press
them into labor gangs, organise them for
co-operative work. They distribute the
rice, collect the taxes, and impose strict
discipline.
The newspaper of this village is “Nhan
Dan”, a Liberation Front publication
named after the Party organ published
in Hanoi, capital of Communist North
Vietnam. The village across the way turns
to the district capital for justice, but here
“People’s Tribunals” organised by the
peasants themselves under Vietcong
guidance try “oppressive landlords” and
other unfortunates accused of belonging

Right now you probably think
that your company needs a
Cessna aircraft like it needs a
Castle in Spain.
A new company car? Maybe.
A new turret lathe? Perhaps.
What about a computer? Could
be!
But a Cessna! How could we
ever use a Cessna, you say. And
in any case we can’t afford that
sort of luxury.
Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps
you don’t need an aircraft.
Perhaps your company can’t
afford one.
But, then again, perhaps it
does. And can.
Do you know for instance that
there are several companies in
Australia (including one of
your competitors perhaps ?)
which have proved conclusively
that a Cessna can save them
literally thousands of pounds a
year savings in such ex-
penses as car operation, hotel
accommodation, travelling ex-
vou two tmoutes agai
y 0 ot interest you at all, unds a year.
I “uVsave you , ■
penses, executive time. But
perhaps even more important
than saving costs, is the addi-
tional sales revenue they have
earned revenue they would
never have made without a
Cessna!
Of course you don’t leap out
and buy an aircraft just like
that. You didn’t get your other
equipment that way either. But
it could be that if you take the
trouble to work out just how
much of your personnel’s time
is taken up in travelling and
the costs involved you’ll
turn to light aircraft operation
for sound economic reasons.
There’s a Rex Aviation con-
sultant ready to help you make
a critical appraisal of your
company’s particular field of
operations.
If you’ve read this far you are
on your way to saving your
company real money. For you,
flying your own aeroplane may
NOT be the answer, but until
you investigate personally,
you’ll never know for sure.

A Government survey of the inter-
vening land would show one pattern
Lf ownership and tenancy. But a Viet-
long survey of the same fields shows
mother, for the Communists have re-
distributed the land among the more
pliable peasants. The Vietcong mainly
use American weapons they have cap-
tured from Government forces, and
when the Government ordered a call-up
of young men between 20 and 25, it was
almost as if the Vietcong had done so, for
many of those who shied at serving with
one side dodged the draft by fleeing to
the other. While Saigon was running a
drive for men in the Mekong Delta, an
-officer was arrested in a provincial capi-
tal while offering 1000 piastres to each
recruit: he was recruiting for the Viet-
cong, not the National Army.
The two South Vietnams are almost
superimposed one upon the other. Which
is more real to the Vietnamese? It is
often said that while the Vietcong may
dominate most of the countryside, the
Government still holds the towns and the
roads. But even this proposition is highly
suspect. The Communists are wreaking
such mainline mischief on Vietnam’s
principal arteries that in order to deliver
(much-needed petrol, oil, and paraffin to
Ben Cat, less than 40 miles north of
Saigon, road tankers have to make a
detour of more than 550 miles through
the mountains. The Vietcong waylay and
shoot up trucks, cars, and even long-dis-
tance buses crowded with women, child-
ren and old men. They hold up others,
sometimes kidnapping the occupants,
sometimes simply demanding money and
delivering a propaganda lecture on the
iniquities of Saigon and the Americans.
They mine the roads and verges, blow up
abridges, and dig up long sections of high-
ways to block them completely.
They have challenged the Government
and the army: try if they dare to force
open the road to Tay Ninh that leads to
the Cambodian border. They announced
in advance that they would close the
route north-east from Saigon to Phan
Thiet, compelling traffic to take the in-
land artery to Dalat, which they will
doubtless cut in turn. The Vietcong can
now make it unsafe to -travel out of
Saigon by any principal route. Mean-
while trains are frequently wrecked, and
one that remained unscathed recently

took a whole week to travel 350 miles

stretches by gangs working under Viet-
cong direction.
Communications to a disconcerting
number of places are now only main-

often have to hedge-hop only a few
feet from the ground in order not to
present a target to Communist gunners.
Into the areas that are largely cut off as
they move to isolate the towns, the Viet-

DENNIS BLOODWORTH
UNIONS
Trouble On the Island
SYDNEY Garden Island dock-
yard, still recovering from a 14-day
strike two months ago, has industrial
troubles again this time involving the
small but nonetheless key union, the
Federated Ships Painters and Dockers of
Australia The Department ot Navy, in
attempting to avoid a further strike,
has asked a Commonwealth Conciliation
Commissioner Mr Horan to make an
award which virtually amounts to a “no-
strike” order. But the union through its
self-acknowledged Communist secretary
T. Gordon objected on the ground that
the Commissioner had no power to do
so.
The dispute began on November 5
when 290 painters and dockers w'ent
on strike in protest over the employment
of a man named Boddy as leading hand.
The union had asked for his resig-
nation. However, the next day the men
resumed work pending the outcome of
a hearing by the Commission. Early
last week Mr C. Coughlin, appearing for
the Minister of the Navy, told Mr Horan
that the Department could have sacked
the men who had refused to work with
Boddy but had chosen instead to have
the matter settled by conciliation.
“It has caused loss of efficiency and
could result in lower production at great
cost. The dispute is a threat to the big-
gest dockyard in Australia and the
most important in the Southern Hemi-
sphere to our allies,” Mr Coughlin said.
Boddy had been a painter for four years
and a leading hand for two: it was not
the first time the union had ordered
a man to relinquish his position.
Mr Gordon said the union had asked
a man to resign only four times in 40
years. “In this case we are prepared to
allow Boddy to continue work as an
ordinary painter and docker. If the Navy
wants to sack men for refusing to work
with him that is all right with the union.
But if this goes on any further then we
will expel this member and he won’t be
able to work. But through our attitude
he will bear no financial hardships in the
demotion,” he said.
The Commissioner told the parties he
felt the matter had gone far beyond the
bounds of a domestic matter for the
union (as Mr Gordon had suggested) and
was now of a graver significance. Mr
Horan then adjourned the hearing and
for two days the Department and the
union conferred privately failing to
reach any settlement.
It was then that Mr Coughlin asked
Mr Horan to make the award. In the
meantime the position will remain un-
changed until the dispute is heard again
by Mr Horan on November 23.
TAB
Surprise
ADELAIDE South Australian
Premier Sir Thomas Playford’s announce-
ment that the Off-Course Totalisator
Committee had accepted the Govern-
ment’s plan for off-course betting has
ended years of haggling between the
Committee and the Premier himself.
A Bill is being drafted and will be intro-
duced to Parliament after the March
elections.
The Committee’s agreement (with four
safeguard provisos already accepted by
the Government) came as a surprise after
the Governments 14-point TAB plan
had been described variously as “un-
workable” and a “poor second best” to
the Victorian system sought by racing
clubs.
The TAB Bill faces a tough time when
it reaches Parliament and even before:
the Committee has indicated that it will
make further representations to the
Premier in an endeavor to bring the Bill
more in line with the Victorian TAB.
Church opposition will undoubtedly
be renewed when the proposed Bill
reaches Parliament. The Protestant
Churches have expressed opposition to
any major extension of gambling and
have been feuding steadily for four
years with racing interests over the TAB
issue. At the moment the churches are
apparently satisfied that Premier Play-
ford’s tame TAB plan will not undermine
the moral fibre of the State. This is
important to the Premier for the power-
ful church support in March could be
crucial.

“No Greater Privilege”
SYDNEY Last week for the second
Le in the history of Australian journal-
ism a journalist was punished for re-
vising to reveal his source of informa-
tm. Joseph Buchanan a political writer
r the Sydney Sun was fined £3OO by the
/iSW Labor member, Mr C. J. Earl,
/•fused to reveal the names of contacts
Xho had given him information for an
article published in the newspaper.
Buchanan was asked to identify the
sources during a defamation action by an
'N|W Labor member, Mr C. J. Earl,
‘against Associated Newspapers Ltd and
when he refused Mr Justice Wallace
ordered him to show cause why he should
, not be committed for contempt. The
'acting Chief Justice Mr Justice Clancy
said he considered the case was more
[serious than those of the two English
MR JUSTICE J. CLANCY
journalists, Brendan Mulholland of the
:‘Daily Mail” and Reginald Foster of the
“Daily Sketch” who were gaoled for six
months and three months in February
last year following the Vassal Inquiry.
Mr Justice Clancy said the two Eng-
lish journalists had refused to reveal
sources to a Royal Commission which
'only affected the value of the investiga-
tion. “But to refuse in an action where
an individual seeks redress from another
is to our minds more serious for it may
frustrate the just decision of the issue.
“It is distressing indeed to be called
upon to punish a man of integrity whose
views appear to be sincere as they are
misguided,” Mr Justice Clancy said.
Similar offences by Mr Buchanan or
other journalists would not be so ten-
derly dealt with.” He said Mr L. W.
Street, QC, for the Australian Journalists’
Association, had not claimed journalists
were entitled to absolute free privilege
but had asked for a special code for
them. “Courts must not be impeded by
any who give their allegiance, however
sincerely, to private codes,” Mr Justice
Clancy said.
The only previous case of an Aus-
tralian journalist being punished for re-
fusing to divulge information was in
1940 when the editor of the Melbourne
“Truth”, Mr Frank McGuiness, refused
to give information before a Royal Com-
mission. He was fined £l5. At that time
Sir Hayden Starke, a High Court Judge,
said: “Apart from statutory provisions,
the Press, in courts of law, has no
greater and no less privilege than every
subject of the King.”
The Bulletin was unable to obtain
any comment on the Buchanan case from
the AJA but the Association, it is under-
st: id, will discuss whether journalists
should have the right of protecting their
sources of information at its annual con-
ference which began in Hobart on Friday.
FUEL
Oil Policy
MELBOURNE. New twists were
given to old tangles over fuel pricing
and disposal last week with the Federal
Government moving backwards in an
unravelling attempt which is no substi-
tute for co-ordinated fuel policy under
a Ministry of Power. The Joint Coal
Board’s annual report to the Govern-
ment put a stiffener into its time-hon-
ored complaint that the special pricing
policies of the oil refining companies put
coal at a disadvantage with fuel oil in
the hotly-competitive industrial market
by saying that these policies also result
in petrol prices being higher than they
need be.
If, instead of trying to maximise fuel
oil sales at cheap prices subsidised by
petrol prices, the oil refineries had corn-
formed to the 1962-63 pattern of sales
for all petroleum products last year, the
Board said, about £2O million would
have been saved on the imports bill.
This is just about as much as the oil
companies say they would save on im-
ports if Moonie oil was priced on the
same basis as the supplies they receive
from overseas. Moonie oil looked the
more burning question.
No further on in settling it, the Gov-
ernment moved towards the Tariff Board
in search of a solution which Dr Mal-
colm Mac Kay, member for Evans, was
seeing in quite another direction

underground. Taking up a Bulletin
policy argued before Moonie oil came
to market, Mac Kay advocated the Gov-
ernment buying the Moonie and Altonl
Fields (Queensland) on the oil-in-the-
ground basis to keep the oil there as
a defence reserve. The cost, he said,
would be £5 million a year for about
15 years, a mere drop in the defence
barrel. This would be a safeguard for
the continuance of necessary oil search,
on a more extensive basis. Despite the
urgent defence and further search needs!
the Government announced plans to
spend less on oil search subsidies and:
limit the area of search to successful
areas so far established. “The Govern-
ment had never envisaged the subsidy-
scheme (under which £7 million has,'
been spent since 1959) a? more than a|
temporary measure to encourage search
to a point where success would make it)
self-sufficient,” the Minister for National
Development told Parliament in an-j
nouncing the subsidy cuts.
Despite encouraging but isolated sue -j
cesses, one lone and limited commercial
oilfield and a sick market in oil shares
hardly suggested the point has been,
reached.

SECT

CANBERRA — A strict religious J
sect which forbids its members to join 1
trade unions is likely to cause consider-
able industrial unrest in the ACT. Mem- J
bers of the sect employed by a Canberra f
prefabricated roofing contractor last week
lodged an application with the Industrial
Registrar, Mr C. R. Williams, for a 12-
months’ exemption certificate under the
Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbi-
tration Act from joining the Plumbers’
Union. (At present there is some mystery |
about the sect for they are refusing to I
identify themselves.)
But Mr T. Donnelly, chairman of the
Trades and Labor Council said in a
statement issued after a meeting held
behind “closed doors” in Canberra on \
Thursday night: “If this particular firm I
wants to continue operations in Canberra
it will have to comply with 100 per cent >
union members. All unionists will re- 1
fuse to work with non-unionists.” He
said the secretary of the Plumbers’ Union,
Mr W. A. Andrews, had the support of ;
every trade official in Canberra for 100
per cent unionism in the ACT.
Mr Donnelly said the firm had operat-
ed in Canberra for the past eight years
and up until now had given the unions
no trouble. He considered the employees’
applications for exemption could lead
to a difficult situation.


Point Cook: More Choosy Than Ever
The RAAF’s latest pin-up—the F-11l
By BATMAN
I A T Point Cook there is a small
j museum where the RAAF has
j preserved its first aeroplane. It
is a monoplane, in splendid condition,
and a somewhat curious little creature.

The museum also has the log book for
! the first flying training course which
began on August 18, 1914. Here is one
entry: ,

Then another entry says very bluntly:
••Machine No 1, Capf. WHITE,
Pilot; struck hangar, machine
wrecked.
Capt. White, the late Sir Thomas
White, KBE, DFC, VD, died in 1957.
Lt Williams, now Air Marshal Sir
Richard Williams, KBE, CB, DSO, at
74, is very much alive and generally
considered to be the father of our Air
Force. I met him at the Athenaeum
Club in Melbourne. He ignored the lift.
With Marshal determination he went
straight up the stairs.
The Australian Government brought
out two pilots to start the flying school.
First came Lt Henry Petre in 1913. He
chose Point Cook as the flying field
because it was “ideally suited for both
land and sea planes”. Then several
months later out came Lt Harrison with
two BE biplanes, two Deperdussin mono-
planes and a Bristol Boxkite monoplane.
sir R i chard said that Tommy White
was g ca , ain , he citizen forces This
immediatel caused some embarrassment
and the Army had to make Lt Petre a
captain . There were two others the
c 0 G p. M ertz from the University
Rffl and D j w Manwe „ from th '
Lj ht Horse
® ’
Naturally one had to start talking
about the beautifully-preserved Deper-
dussin. Sir Richard said its preservation
was hard j y surprising. It never got off
the ground> The Deperdussin had three
cylinders in a Y shape. Every time it
taxied out to the take-off position the
plugs oiled up and the engine stopped.
The most useful aircraft was the Box-
kite, although flying it was a most
, ° , r , . ,
delate business It had a flying speed
of about 45 m.p.h., a top speed of about
45 m.p.h. and a stalling speed of about
45 m.p.h. Its ceiling, depending on the
was around 1500 feet and it
took 24 minutes Jo get there. Yet,
said Sir Richard, it was a very safe air-
craft. Nobody ever got killed in the
Boxkite. Everything always happened so
slowly “L fluttered and flopped more
!k:e a eat ‘
Sir Richard explained that they went
solo at 2i hours, and after this they
received no more instruction, unless by
special request. Then after five hours
solo, a total of 7i hours flying, they
were ready to be licensed and this was
done in a most interesting manner. The
Federation Aeronautique Internationale
in France laid down standards for the
world on licensing of pilots. The British
agent for the FAI was the Royal Aero
Club in London which in turn appointed
its examiner in Melbourne. So out to
Point Cook came a general staff officer
of the 3rd Military Area (now Southern
Command), Major E. F. Harrison (later
Brigadier Harrison, MHR, and no rela-
tion to Lt Harrison). His job was to
stand on the ground with a notebook and
make sure that the examinee went
through all the' correct manoeuvres as
laid down by-the FAI.
This included such things as perform-
ing figures of eight, switching off the
engine at 200 feet and landing within a
marked circle on the aerodrome.
Through the war years Point Cook
turned out 105 pilots. It started again
under the three-year-old RAAF in 1924.
Sir Richard said in those days they used
the Avro 504 K. It had a rotary engine
and no throttle. The engine either went
fiat out or not at all, so there was a
somewhat special technique for approach
and landing. There was a button on top
of the control column for starting and
stopping the engine, The pilot as he
came in had to start and stop the engine
all the way to touch down. In 1927 Sir
Richard himself made the decision to
switch to the de Havilland Moth with
the Cirrus engine, the first Air Force to
do so. This Moth was the parent of

All

the Tiger Moth which trained all our
pilots during the Second World War.
The training over the years did not
change much. Mostly it took 12 months
to turn out an officer pilot. After the
Second World War the RAAF wanted
something to compete with the Army’s
Duntroon and the Navy’s Jervis Bay, so
in 1947 they launched the RAAF Col-
lege, a four-year course which covered
flying training and a series of subjects
up to tertiary level.
In 1961 they went a step further
the college took on the rather grander
title of the RAAF Academy. The
Academy became a registered college of
the University of Melbourne.
Standards are going up
rPHis year, for the first time, all the
A graduates of the Academy walk out
as Bachelors of Science. So the Air
Force and one can detect some small
satisfaction has taken a clear lead
on the other Services. The Army has
in progress a system which will give
degree status to the present intake at
Duntroon, but it still has to get the
blessing of Parliament. The Navy makes
sure that selected Naval College gradu-
ates get their degrees in England, but it
has no parallel with the RAAF system.
It is worth discussing why this urge
for degree status is necessary. Sir Rich-
ard Williams, for example, looks at it
from the point of view of the cadet. “If
the Government is going to take a young
man, use up the most vigorous years of
his life, then perhaps toss him out at
47, then it should do something for him.
It should train him in such a way so
that he can get himself a decent job
when he goes out. And he will if he’s a
B.Sc.”
The Commandant of the Academy and
CO at Point Cook, Air Commodore Par-
sons, CBE, DSO, DFC, AFC, is a flier
of some considerable experience and no
possessor of a university degree. I put
it to Air Commodore Parsons that the
pilot of a Mirage or a TFX would need
much practical knowledge of electronics
/and engineering, but he could still handle
such an aircraft most efficiently without
being a Bachelor of Science.
He said: “To be perfectly candid, at
the moment these degrees are not essen-
tial. But 10 to 15 years from now any-
one without a degree in this country just
won’t be considered as first class. Our
standards are going up all the time.
“As far as flying is concerned, essen-
tial ‘no’, desirable ‘yes’. You see, not all
our pilots go through the Academy. We
must have a nucleus of highly-trained
people, at least a dozen a year. These
are our future leaders. They will be
planning the operation of aircraft, talk-
ing to the designers and builders of aero-
planes. They’ll be representing Australia
in all kinds of jobs overseas. A degree
gives them just that much start. There
were times when it would have been a
great help to me.”
Point Cook must have been almost un-
believably bleak in 1914. The You
Yangs seem to divert the main wet
weather streams. For most of the year
the very flat country looks thirsty and
brown, more like a piece of the Mallee
than the lush south. Early in the piece
nobody ever stayed at Point Cook unless
they had to. All but the duty staff would
rush to Melbourne at first opportunity.
Air Marshal Williams tried very hard to
make it look like home. He had cypress
trees planted everywhere which served at
least to break down the winds.
Taking into account that this was the
mother station of the RAAF, it still has
a slight look of impermanence, as if a
City Council really wanted it back in a
few years’ time. The only really good
buildings are the Officers’ Mess and the
Academy’s new quarter million pound
Science Block. The Academy staff is
waiting, hopefully, for a whole complex
of permanent buildings which will cost
another million pounds, but the decision
for this is still in a pile of papers some-
where at Cabinet level.
The cadets live in huts. Every old air-
man knows them, thousands of the same
type were put up during the war. The
cadets call them “wind 'tunnels”. They
are moderately comfortable with a pas-
sage down the centre, and every cadet
gets a room of his own. He has to keep
it in the same, rigid immaculate splendor
just like Duntroon. There’s a regulation
spot for every article. The shirts have
to be folded and piled with beautiful
geometric precision, and books on a
shelf have to descend in height to please
a Group Captain’s orderly eye.
Inspections, of course, can come any
time. But real inspection time is Tuesday
morning, and Monday is traditional
“panic night” when all hands sweat to
get everything perfect. An inspecting
officer is likely to run a finger along the
top of a door, or to ask why one’s foot-
ball boots, clean and shiny, are not in
correct position. Football boots have to
be there even though it might be sunny
March.
They are allowed to put some pictures
and pin-ups on the walls, but the array
I saw revealed little interest in females.
Sex took second place to 30/98 Vaux-
halls, Aston Martins, Phantom jets and
TFX-Fllls. The modern Air Force
appeals to the technical mind.
Indeed in the great hunt for the fit,
clever, young Australian the RAAF can
afford to be more choosy than anyone.
The Air Force does appeal, even if the
technical requirements in the atom age
and the pure precision of the job do
seem terrifying. Most of the older pilots
who flew Wapitis, Bulldogs and Demons

Last year there were 278
all matriculated students, and of thes
they took one in 10. From 20 to f
per cent of applicants are weeded o»
for medical reasons alone; and othej >
fall down because of lack of academl
potential or various personality reason);
Schooling makes little difference. Almo*
all the cadets come from high schools A
Christian Brothers schools.
On the present course only two can)
from public schools. The applicant
appear before a selection board with A)
Commodore Parsons at chairman. Thd
have to show a fairly reasonable passion
for the Air Force and flying, and it
best if they know the names of a feu
RAAF bases like Butterworth, and that
they know the difference between ,
Sabre and a Vampire. Air Commodon
Parsons says there was an interesting
applicant this year. Not only did h|
know the types, but he criticised thd
Minister and the Government at lengtlj
for what he felt was a disastrous decision!
in choosing America’s TFX instead off
Britain’s TSR2.
Once the cadets get on course the!
numbers shrink quite rapidly. In the-
office of the Deputy Commandant, i
Group - Captain Shiells, DFC, AFO-
there’s a photograph of each course. A#
each cadet fails on course he gets a
red cross over his picture. It remindsj
one of the pictures they used to have
in the squadrons during the war, except
that the red crosses used to be black.
On 17 course there are 32 heads, but
when you look at the photograph of 14
course the red crosses have multiplied
and there are only 14 left with the possi-
bility of more to go.
For sfirogs it’s hell
actually leave the Air Force.
Those who fail academically mostly
leave the Academy and take the other
road to a flying career, the 12 months
course which brings them out with a
short service commission. Those who
fail as pilots have the alternative of be-
coming navigators or going into the
technical branch.
It is one of the frustrations of the
course that they do not really start flying)
until the fourth year, when already theyi
are degree men. To keep up their interest
they are allowed just a gentle whiff of
flying in the early years.
In the first year they can get 10 hours,
in the second year five hours and in the


third year five hours. Ultimately they
go 10 the Basic Flying Training School
at Point Cook where they do 120 hours
on Winjeels, then over to Pearce, West
Australia, for another 120 hours on
Vampire jets which usually takes their
course into the fifth year. They graduate
as Flying Officers. The scrub rate for
the Academy students is roughly the
same as for all pilot trainees, nigh on 40
per cent.
How long flying training will continue
at historic Point Cook is a matter of
conjecture. For sprog pilots it’s hell.
Over at Avalon, just across the way,
there are Boeing 707 s doing circuits and
bumps, at Laverton there are Sabres, at
Essendon and soon Tullamarine, there
are Boeing 7275, Electras and heaven
knows what. The poor little bloke in
his Winjeel, before he sets out on a low-
level cross-country, he has to get cleared
by four authorities: Point Cook, Avalon,
Laverton and Civil. The weather could
change the situation any minute. If the
trainee doesn’t keep up to the second
with the right information he might find
a 707 boring down behind him on an
ILS approach path.
The Winjeels have a scheduled life
until 1968, and then the RAAF will have
to find a replacement and, possibly, a
new area for Basic Flying Training.
Like most Air Forces the RAAF expects
to start all through jet training and the
propeller will become just a memory.
We will get the situation as with US
pilots who come here and don’t know
how to fly a propeller aeroplane. Air
Commodore Parsons and Wi'ng-Cdr F. O.
Knudsen, CO of BFTS, feel that the
RAAF needs a trainer which will last
late into the ’seventies. Therefore, this
all-through trainer should be super-
sonic, something like America’s twin jet
T3B. You raise the argument that the
young pilot on his first solo could get
out of the circuit area and flash straight
through the sound barrier.
Status taken seriously
don’t see this as an argument.
They feel it’s cheaper in the long run
to have one trainer. And when you sug-
gest this is awe-inspiring equipment to
put in front of a trainee, they say: “You
can learn to drive just as easily on a
Jaguar as a Mini Minor.”
But, as said earlier, the flying comes
later. It has to be remembered that this
is very much a college of Melbourne
University and the lecturers are supplied
by Melbourne University. The students
are fortunate in having as their dean,
Professor V. D. Hopper, professor of
Physics at Melbourne and a world
authority on upper air physics. Maybe
it is tough learning to be a military
officer and an academic at the same
time, but there are benefits. For the
lecturer there’s the advantage, if a
lecture starts at 9 a.m. by heavens every
student has to be there at 9 a.m.
There’s no starvation for equipment.
If the students want any books they
arrive in a hurry. There’s certainly no
queueing up in the library, no students
sitting on the floor. Classes are small
enough to remind the senior lecturer in
physics, Dr P. J. of the intimacy
of Oxford and Cambridge in the old
days. Then if one suggests to Professor
Hopper that is rather a tiny show for
a University College he says simply that
there are more third year physics students
at the Academy than at Melbourne Uni-
versity when he was doing physics over
20 years ago.
The professor takes the university
status of the Academy very seriously.
There are 15 students from Melbourne
on the job doing post-graduate research.
He has a £15,000 annual research grant
from the RAAF and he has something
of a Messel touch for gathering grants
and equipment from all over. So they
are doing all sorts of research on the
upper atmosphere, they are experiment-
ing with radar meteorology, breaking into
new fields on long and short range com-
munications. Then, particularly fascina-
ting for the cadets, they are running an
official satellite tracking station in close
association with Woomera.
So you get this rather extraordinary
atmosphere where young pilots, who one
time had to know little more than the
theory of flight, now work in an
academic world side by side with
students on their way to their Ph.Ds.
As for discipline, Group-Captain
Shiells feels that the RAAF has a some-
what different approach not as cast-iron,
not as inflexible as the Army. Maybe
the agonies are not as prolonged as in
the other Services, but the system is
much the same. In the first year the
cadet is the lowest form of life, he waits
on the tables, he goes through initiation
ceremonies, at dinner time he answers
questions from senior students on RAAF
history and news of the day, and he
never walks, he goes everywhere at the
double. Group-Captain Shiells says that
they are certainly not as tough as some
of the US academies. There the students
go through what is called the “square
meal”. They sit at the dinner table at
attention, no talking unless spoken to.
As they eat the spoon or fork has to
make a perfect rectangular approach to
the mouth. This done he must put down
his spoon or fork on the plate and con-
tinue to sit at attention until he is ready
for the next mouthful.
Traditional dunking
the stydent progresses he picks up
privileges. In the second year he is
allowed a car and he can march about
instead of running. He is allowed once
again to wear civilian clothes at pre-
scribed times, his leave improves and
finally, glory be, he gets special Mess
privileges and he is allowed to drink.
Punishment is practically standard issue
as for the other Services. The cadet has
to be out on the parade ground at 6.20
a.m., rifle, boots, sidearms, etc. There
they stay until 6.50 and, depending upon
the humor of the senior orderly cadet,
they go to work. The average labor is
10-12 laps of the parade ground at the
double. The record, established one
frightful morning, is 22 laps.
The students work the academic year
of Melbourne University, then at other
times there are compensations. They do
a canoe trip down the Goulburn with
the CO, said to be an iron canoe man.
They do tour of Eastern bases,
Williamstown, Richmond, de Havillands
at Bankstown. There’s the northbound
tour, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin,
Alice Springs, and there’s the tour to
Edinburgh and Woomera.
You think what lies ahead of the
RAAF cadet of 1964, his responsibilities,
and the fearsome machines he will have
to handle and understand, and the
natural conclusion is that he would be
a rather earnest, worried young man.
But all the officers at Point Cook insist
that this is not so and they haven’t
changed much from 1928 or 1936. The
same things go on.
The junior cadets by tradition have
just three chances for cutting loose and
they all involve dunking senior cadets in
the pond behind the officers’ mess. These
come when the senior cadet goes solo,
when he gets his B.Sc and his 21st birth-
day. They go hunting for the man in
question after 10 p.m. and then he gets
dragged forcibly to the spot. The 21st
birthday dunking could be the worst
because that might come in June and it
involves a lot of dunks; whereas the solo
job usually comes in warmer October.
The tradition then is to draw a pair
of wings on the young birdman’s chest
in raven oil.


Holding our Heads
a Little Higher
The Defence Revieiv
By T. B. MILLAR
The Government’s various defence
measures announced during last
week appear to mark a substantial
increase in our defence capacity. One
can be bemused by their multiplicity
and their expense. Instead, it is worth
beginning at the other end, asking what
Australia needs for its adequate defence,
and then examining the new proposals to
see whether they are sufficient.
First, we need the firm co-operation
of our allies, based on their interest in
our survival and their respect for our
contribution to the defence of the region
and of Australia. The measures cannot
fail to add to our stature in this regard,
and therefore to our security.'
We need defence forces which are a
measure of our determination to defend
ourselves, strong enough to help our
friends in their time of need, and which
provide a degree of deterrence on the
impulsive or calculated aggressions of any
imperialists in our region. Unfortunately
it will probably be three or four years
before this comes about, even though
the basis (or most of it) has been laid.
For, dramatic as the introduction of
compulsory service is as a social measure,
it is not going to be dramatic in terms of
defence build-up. We have at the moment
a standard infantry battalion in Malaya
with the Commonwealth Strategic
Reserve, and two and a half “pen-
tropic” battalions in Australia. It will be
at least 18 months before National Ser-
vice makes an appreciable difference to
this strength, and probably three years
before we are able to provide even one
infantry division as a field force.
Two other aspects of the Army —-
equipment and organisation are no
more reassuring. The Government has
promised extensive purchases of
weapons, vehicles and stores, but the
Army is only “investigating” low-level
anti - aircraft weapons, air - portable
armored fighting vehicles, new artillery
weapons, combat surveillance equipment,
etc. How many years will it be before
we turn from investigation to purchase
"We must be getting into the Barossa Valley.”
or manufacture? The needs have been
known for a long time, but if customary
procedures are followed, we can expect
a further extensive delay, a delay we
should not countenance and cannot
afford. In the meantime, we have a field
gun, the American 105 m.m., which is
only marginally better in some respects
than the World War II 25-pounder, and
marginally worse in others; we have
almost no medium artillery, no light
tanks, very few amphibious vehicles, and
a grossly inadequate number of heli-
copters for jungle warfare.
The structure of the army’s field force
is equally vital. The Pentropic Divi-
sion was introduced at a time when
the United States had a similar organisa-
tion, which, however, it soon discarded.
There is little evidence that the five
large battalions of the division would be
tactically manoeuvrable, although in
fairness, until tried out in a complete
division, and especially under battle con-
ditions, the evidence against their being
so is not conclusive. Irrespective of this
or any other factor, it is absurd for us
to continue with an organisation that
does not mesh either with the British
or the Americans, the two allies with
whom we will be engaged in opera-
tions. The Defence Review makes no
mention of any change, yet change is
necessary for our defence preparedness.
A third lack for the Army is the
ability to get the field force quickly to
any trouble spot and supply it. The
present squadron of Hercules heavy
transports could perhaps. move and
supply a small battalion for a limited
period, but little more. The extra squad-
ron announced will not be available for
eighteen months or two years.
In the RAAF, we will still have no
deterreiit force for several years. Why is
the - Government continuing to assume
we will not need one before 1968 or
1969? The menace of Soekarno’s Indo-
nesia (or of Indonesia’s Soekarno) which
has prompted the major change to com-
pulsory army service should also have
prompted the creation of an air strike
force. By purchasing Phantoms and
putting half the Canberra crews into
them initially, we could have a squad-
ron or more of this excellent aircraft
operational by about September next year.

Our alternative is not to go on using
Canberras, which against MIG 21s are
like a chicken to a hawk; it is to depend
entirely on our allies.
The final major inadequacy in the
new programme relates to the Navy,
which apparently is to be denied a
strike weapon. It will thus rely entirely
on surface-to-air missiles (which it does
not yet have) and obsolescent guns to
defend itself against jet aircraft armed
with stand-off weapons and gunboats
armed with modern missiles. It will
have an improved anti-submarine capa-
city, but we cannot overlook the need for
surface defence as well. This lack of a
strike weapon, which the Sky Hawk
could have provided, will of course limit
the escort role of the Navy for the
Army’s main component and logistical
back-up.
Good marks for trying
Tt may have been expecting too much
1 of the Government to provide this ad-
ditional and expensive equipment. If, as
is to be hoped (since the Opposition
has yet to develop a coherent or realis-
tic defence policy), the Government
retains a majority in the Senate, per-
haps then it will see its way clear to
these extra but no less essential measures.
Certainly the cost is a problem. But
the cost of security is slight compared
with the cost of insecurity.
Most of the other decisions stemming
from the Defence Review are not in
fact new departures but rational develop-
ments, no less welcome for that. Dual
Mirage trainers are needed because we
possess Mirages which are we have
discovered complicated aircraft to
convert to. The Dakota training aircraft,
the P2VS Neptunes, the anti-submarine
Gannets all these are wearing out,
and have to be replaced. All-through jet
trainers are needed in a modern air force.
The Melbourne was due for its half-
life refit. We have long needed patrol
craft for New Guinea, and will be glad of
them for Borneo, since our minesweep-
ers there are excellent for catching mines
but not for chasing patrol craft.
Our broad defence structure is another
matter not mentioned in the Review,
but it is geared for peace, not for a
defence emergency. It is run primarily
by public servants, undoubted though
their loyalty and administrative ability
are. The co-ordination of the Services
and professional control by the Defence
Department are distant goals constantly
receding.
Despite these measures still to come,
we must give the Government, in its
new defence programme, good marks for
trying; we may even give it a medal for
courage. We can all breathe a little
easier and hold our heads a little
higher.


Building from Village Bevel
” Phenomenal growth ” in New Guinea
By PATRICIA ROLFE
When Dr Margaret Mead talks
about New Guinea, out of know-
ledge gathered over 36 years’
anthropological study, many people are
prepared to listen. And when Dr Mead
went to Canberra after returning last
week from a further two months in the
territory one would think people in the
Department of Territories would listen
to her because much of what she had to
say to the Sydney Press was favorable
to the Administration. 1
Dr Mead does not pussyfoot and does
not worry much about the boundaries
between one field and another; she will
branch out into politics and economics
without much encouragement. She be-
lieves that the United Nations is demand-
ing “excessive speed” in the granting
of the territory’s independence. “The
United Nations says Australia must do
this and this and this, and you must do
it all next week,” she said. The only
question she evaded was whether Aus-
tralia should get the help of other
countries to develop Papua-New Guinea.
“That,” she said, “is something Australia
has to decide for herself.”
Dr Mead’s standpoint is a sort of
restrained optimism, which is probably
the best way to face the enormous
problems in New Guinea which she sees
as clearly as anyone else. And her views
are charged with the great affection she
has for the people of “her” village on
the south coast of Manus, whom she
knew as young men and women when
she was first there in 1928, and who are
now “old, old people” with no teeth and
whose most fervent request is for glasses.
Dr Mead said that the people of “her”
village had changed as much in the past
11 years as they had in the previous 25.
“They have completely entered the
modern wofld,” she said. “The present
growth in New Guinea is phenomenal
and a sense of national unity is growing.”
She believed the chief factor in the
change was the programme which had
begun to bring education down to the
village level. “This has made an extra-
ordinary transformation,” she said. “I
feel the programme is almost ln
other primitive countries the idea has
been to educate an elite. This leaves the
villages further and further behind. That
was the general pattern in Africa. But in
New Guinea the aim has been to give
everyone some education. I don’t know
who thought of the scheme. I believe
it was someone in the Department of
Territories but nobody seems to get the
credit.
“It means that many villages have a
tame Australian. These are mostly
young, unmarried men, and their job
extends far beyond the classroom. They
might teach adults at night, organise
sports, get women’s clubs going. These
teachers are from all kinds of back-
grounds. In my village the teacher had
been an actor and he regarded everything
as a dress rehearsal. I met another who
had been working in a railway goods-
yard when he saw a newspaper advertise-
ment calling for volunteers with the
Intermediate certificate to go to New
Guinea, wrapped around some goods.
It is a job for adventurous, enthusiastic
mavericks, but I don’t think it’s a life’s
work. It isn’t good to spend your life
in isolation.”
Dr Mead said she gathered from the
people of her village that there was a
lively interest in the proceedings of the
Legislative Council. “Although,” she
said, “I must admit the Manus islanders
are relatively politically sophisticated
and have a history of political activity.
Eleven years ago they wanted to be taxed
and nobody would collect their taxes,
and they wanted an assembly and no-
body would give them an assembly. But
when the council meets there is the same
sort of social commotion that you get
when parliament meets in any country
And news of what is happening there
filters through to the villages. Eleven
years ago the only radio you could pick
up was Radio Moscow. Now there are
radios in all the schools and villages
which bring the debates to everyone. In
my village a new word ‘stamit’ kept
coming into the conversation. ‘What is
“stamit”?’ I asked. It was estimate.
However, Dr Mead said, New Guinea
was unquestionably the most difficult
territory to govern in the world today.
“There is nothing like it anywhere,” she
said. “The language problem is formid-
able. They talk of the different language
groups in the Soviet Union. In Papua-
New Guinea there are 700 different
languages. It is extremely difficult ter-
rain. Transport is frightful and the
country has few resources.”
Dr Mead said that the greatest prob-
lem existed with the people who had
emerged from primitive life. “These, are
the people who have been depressed by
imperfect education in the past 100
years,” she said. “They are what we call
culturally deprived. We have about 25
million of them in the United States.
They are not the ones who wear a grass
skirt but those whose grandmother wore
a grass skirt. Part of the blame rests
with the missionaries who taught them
to reject the modern world and who
encouraged a simple sort of obedience
and innocence. That tradition is broken
today, but the problem remains.”
Dr Mead said that the most important
thing for the people of Papua - New
Guinea was to retain a sense of their
terrain and for the Administration to
keep contact at village level.
“Anonymity does not exist in primi-
tive communities,” she said. “Everyone

This picture shows some of the Breasting Dolphins and Pier Head
fabricated by Humes Limited at North West Cape,
When the United States Navy Communications Facility at North West Cape in Western Australia required an
1,100 feet long pier and marine terminal, Humes Limited was the firm chosen by the main contractors to fabricate
the tubular bents, piling, framing, towers and dolphins. Standards had to be high.
Humes Steel factory in Perth had the resources, experience, labour and plant to undertake this large and im-
portant contract. Over 2,600 tons of Australian steel was fabricated into tubular sections up to 39" diameter.
Prefabricated sections were then transported 970 miles by rail and road to the construction site. At the site a
team of Hume field engineers, familiar with local conditions and experienced in working in remote underdeveloped
areas, fabricated the components into final sub-assemblies.
Natural hazards such as floods and cyclones were encountered during the currency of the contract, but these
did not deter Humes. They completed the contract ahead of the scheduled completion date. From planning
to final inspection, Humes recorded “Mission Successfully Completed”,

knows who he is and what he is there
for. Once you take that knowledge
away from people you have to give them
something else. Already in New Guinea
you get the same sort of young people
you get anywhere, adolescents who are
not educated enough to get a good job
but who want all the things that money
can buy. And we already have an urban
problem in Manus.”
Dr Mead believes that New Guinea
may be the first place where society
could reverse what is now the universal
trend of people moving from smaller
centres to large cities. This is simply
because there is still enough time in
New Guinea to plan smaller cities, and
more of them, which give people the life
they want. She does not regard the
growth of cities as inevitable. “They
say it’s part of man’s evolution,” she
said. “But nothing is evolution until you
don't know how to stop it.”
Best Single Investment
Mead said one small job which could
be tackled right away is confining
everyone to one name. “When I was first
in Manus everyone had about nine
names,” she said. “All acquired for dif-
ferent reasons and used by different
people for different reasons. Now they
are down to two or three, but they will
still have a different one for their chest
X-rays and their bank book and on the
electoral roll. And they’ll give someone
else’s name sometimes. They all need
a good indestructible birth certificate and
one name only.”
Dr Mead believes the best single in-
vestment Australia can make is in air
fares for Papuans and New Guineans
to come to the mainland. “Until they
have been in Australia they simply
have no idea how Australians live and
work,” she said. “They really believe
they do all the work by which Aus-
tralians grow rich. To come down here
and see Australians working on the roads
is far more useful than all the films in
the world in teaching them what is
needed to build their own country.”
Dr Mead, who is curator of ethnology
at the Museum of Natural History, New
York, and Adjunct Professor of An-
thropology at Columbia, said that this
trip would not add another book to her
total of nine, although she might add a
chapter somewhere.
She felt that subsequent development
in Manus and Samoa, the two places
where she did early study, had been
exciting, but admitted that the original
choices had been capricious. “I went
to Manus simply because it was level
walking,” she said. “And my professor
sent me to Samoa because it had a three-
weekly boat service and he could keep
in touch with me, but I promptly moved
on to an island which had no boat
service.”


A Fight Nobody Will Win
“A little more sensationally ”
From HAROLD DVORETSKY in London
Around Europe these days they are
saying the mighty Volkswagen
company wished dearly it had just
let its grievances against the test by
“DM”, the sensational and often sen-
sationalist German consumer magazine,
go unanswered.
For VW’s legal action against “DM”
now looks a certainty to drag on for
years and years a constant reminder
to the German public to buy “DM” and
a reminder also that even a VW "product
has been subject to criticism.
“DM” started the big shindig when
it ran a test story claiming that after a
long test they had found one Volks-
wagen, the 1500 model, “unreliable”.
The VW 1500, they said, unlike other
VW cars, had been constantly in for
repairs since the test started. The clutch,
among other parts, left a lot to be
desired.
Infuriated by the harsh criticism
which the Volkswagen company regards
as completely unjustified, it slapped in a
temporary injunction against “DM” to
retract the story, publish VW’s opinion
on it and prevent “DM” publishing
further comments on the car. “DM”
cocked a snook. There was no retraction.
VW’s comments were not published and
the following issue of “DM” continued
its tirade against the VW 1500.
VW countered by claiming £A50,000
for alleged breach of injunction. But it
was to no avail. While “DM” eventually
agreed with the judge not to republish
the comment they were not required (at
that stage) to retract the story in part or
full, and they refused to reprint VW’s
rebuttal claiming that the old German
Press law of the subject being able to
reply to criticism was outdated and
should be repealed. “If it isn’t and we
agreed.” a “DM” spokesman told me,
“we’d have an issue full of manu-
facturers’ opinions. It would be
ridiculous.”
VTow while all this was going on and
, “DM” was carrying forth its attack
on the VW 1500, “Bild Zeitung”, a Ger-
man tabloid, made its own tests on the
1500. It claimed the car was “reliable,
fast ... a star”. It was “DM’s” turn to
be annoyed. They volleyed back with a
thundering broadside claiming that
“Bild’s” tests were corrupt. This led off
a fresh duel of injunctions and lawsuits
between “Bild” and “DM”.
It was during one of the many hear-
ings that “Bild Zeitung” maintained the
editor of “DM” had declared in a policy
conference that “DM” test would “smash
the Volkswagen myth”.
But all this is just peanuts to the main
issue—a whopping £AI million-plus law-
suit for losses VW claim they allegedly
incurred from the original “DM” article.
VW claim “DM” test drivers damaged
the cars by driving them at impossible
speeds in bottom gear.
To understand all this more fully one
should explain to the Australian reader,
used to the mild condemnation of the
Australian “Choice” or the British
“Which?” consumer’s magazines, “DM
Test” is, as someone once put it, “a
revelation of almost suicidally provoca-
tive boldness”. It’s all this and more.
“DM” does not beat around the bush.
Three tests on products are now pub-
lished weekly (it was monthly when it
started in September, 1961, changed to
fortnightly after 12 months and went to
weekly 18 months ago). Each one of
these tests is likely to start along the
lines of a recent issue on footwear. It
read: “Most children’s shoes available
here (Germany) cripple the feet. Shoe
manufacturers and traders are honest
men. Or are they? Do they put their
own children into shoes that could
cripple their feet?” Names and details
then follow inside.
It is nothing to pick up “DM” and
find that new potatoes are “often last
year’s final crop”. A canner of beans
found his product dismissed by name as
“smelling of pickle, very insipid taste”.
Nor are VW the first car-maker to
strike trouble with “DM”. Fiats naturally
brought an action against them after a
test of their 1500 model in which (after
a brake failure) “DM” ranted the car was
“mortally dangerous”. The absurd im-
plication came out as though all Fiats
were diabolical monsters. Eventually
the judge told “DM” to make it clear
they meant only the car they had tested.
“DM” agreed.
Right now things are fairly quiet on
the “DM” front. For a while during the
VW fight circulation hit 750,000. It
dropped down to 500,000 during the lull
and has now settled around that figure.
“If anything, it’s on the rise,” the “DM”
claimed last week.
“DM” has had around a
hundred lawsuits against it. But it
should worry. Each court battle has
proved to be a circulation booster, and
even if they lose the VW case it is un-
likely to change their modus operandi.
“A year ago it might have sunk us,” said
the man from “DM”. “Now, the boss
says we have sufficient set aside to pay
the damages should it be necessary.”
The boss? Waldemar Schweitzer, a
small, wiry, chain-smoking, black-haired
German who drinks beer “all the time”.
Schweitzer, now 37, started after the
war as a journalist on a British licensed
paper in Cologne. After a few years he
moved to Freiburg in South-West Ger-
many, and worked as a freelance. Later
he set up a successful provincial news
agency, and in 1961, with profits from
this enterprise, he founded a West Ger-
man consumers’ magazine along the
same line as “Which?”, “Choice” and the
American equivalents.
“DM Test,” according to the more
sedate English magazine “Which?” isn’t
a consumer’s magazine in the original
conception of this type of periodical.
“DM,” say “Which?”, accepts funds
(from advertising) from manufacturers
which could “corrupt” it. It also makes
a profit while “Which?” and others are
strictly non-profit making organisations.
“DM,” too, is sold on bookstalls. The
“Which?” type of consumer magazine
goes out by post to members.
“DM” themselves put it this way:
“ ‘Which?’ may look a more serious type
of magazine. ‘DM’ puts the same stuff
over a little more sensationally.” You
can’t be fairer than that. “DM” says:
“But we both have identical ideals
we are out to provide a service for the
consumer.” “DM Test” accepts adver-
tising—but overall its advertising content
is low (four pages maximum each 60 to
72-page issue. A week or so ago they
had 10 pages of advertising, but this was
a special dealing with cars of the
“Mercedes-type”.
“Which?” claims never to have had
a lawsuit against it by an angry manu-
facturer in the 7i years of its existence,


but, a spokesman told me, the magazine
had published corrections to mistakes on
several occasions.
Schweitzer conducts an editorial-type
diary on the back page of “DM” which
is likened to revolutionary type politics
rather than consumer defence but the
German readers apparently love it. As
the aircraft write “DM Test” in the sky
in smoke over towns in Germany, they
do as they are bid and buy it.
Schweitzer, who has nursed “DM”
along since the first number appeared in
Stuttgart in September, 1961, says he’s
made £A1,000,000 out of it. He owns
90 per cent, and his editor owns the
other 10 per cent. He started in a
cellar testing women’s stockings. Now,
he says, he could get along from sub-
scriptions alone and not worry about
advertising revenue.
Schweitzer is supremely confident.
Already he’s won his point not to have
the VW case heard in one of Germany’s
“commercial” courts. “The judges are
all businessmen,” say “DM”. “They
would naturally be against us.” “DM”
got its way.
Now the depositions are being col-
lected again from witnesses and prepara-
tions made for the case to go on in civil
court. As yet no date has been fixed for
it to be heard, but even if “DM” and
VW can’t agree on the 1500 model they
both agree on one thing—the case could
go on for years and years.
Menzies in Decline
Melbourne may lose its “finest inn”
By PETER GREEN
Tn spite of the Windsor opening in
1883 and of more showy hotels
which came rather later (like the South-
ern Cross in 1962), Menzies always has
been THE hotel in Melbourne. We have
it on the evidence of Mr Anthony Trol-
lope who said: “I have never put myself
up at a better inn, in any part of the
world.” Menzies’ palms have always out-
potted other people’s palms, and Menzian
curtains have out red-velveted other
people’s curtains.
So you can imagine the appalling
shock when we picked up our “Age”
last week and there on the front page
was the announcement “Menzies Hotel,
Melbourne’s prestige hotel for most of its
97 years, is up for sale as an office
block.” The price was £1,500,000, and
the chairman of directors of Federal
Hotels Ltd., Mr R. R. Markielie, was
quoted as saying: “Menzies is having
a hard battle competing against the
Southern Cross and the more modern
hotels. Unfortunately, it is a bit old-
fashioned these days.”
The next day the manager, Mr Ralph
Voigt, said it was all a mistake. Yes,
Menzies was up for sale in the same way
that anything else was up for sale if
anyone offered a big enough price, but
he expected it to be there for a long,
long time yet. “That story did us a lot
of harm,” said he. “Do you know that
one woman rang up and wanted to buy
a couple of chairs out of the lounge.
Others have asked whether they will be
able to have their Christmas parties.”
However, Mr Voigt didn't altogether ease
our worries. After all Federal Hotels
Ltd has been having its problems.
Dammit, Menzies is Melbourne, and
we’re not anxious to part with the
august, old place. On Cup night this
year the yachting Livingston Brothers
turned on their regular party, just as
they have been doing these past 20 years.
The Governor-General was there and so
was Prince William of Gloucester. The
decorations alone cost £lOOO.
All the walls in the Dome Room had
painted backdrops to give the guests
the impression they were aboard a yacht
and part of the decor was four scale
models of Kurrewa V, their America’s
Cup candidate. Nothing was drunk all
night but French champagne. People
were inclined to compare it with other
Livingston Cup night parties. At Men-
zies there was the night that the Dome
Room was made into Venice and they
had a real canal. To get across to the
party you had to float across water in
a gondola.
Indeed Menzies does has an atmos-
phere. The dining room, after the plush
Legislative Council chamber, would be
the best room in Melbourne. The ceiling
is as high as the Exhibition building
and its good solid lonic columns have a
most satisfying symmetry. The chande-
lier cost £5OOO. It is a copy of the
original built for Maria Theresa, Empress
of Austria (1740-1780) which now hangs
in Austria’s Schoenbrunn Palace It
weighs three-quarters of a ton and while
you are waiting for your crepe suzette
you can always sit back there and count
the 3000 pieces of glass.
Of course, the whole place is air-con-
ditioned, the reception rooms are modern
and bars like the Tavern have their
acres of vinyl. Although one reception
area is still called “The Drawing Room”,
this is where the ladies were expected
to take their coffee while gentlemen
smoked their cigars and told their stories.
It is the upstairs part of Menzies which
seems rather uneconomic. The passages
are wide enough to take a cable car, the
stairs have extremely slideable banisters,
and unlike these modern, concrete, anti-
septic hotels, the floorboards underneath
creak most beautifully. The rooms, too,
are big with big bathrooms and real
baths.
Downstairs there is still the brass-
framed noticeboard which carries the
daily quotes from the Melbourne Stock
Exchange, and up the side there is a
glass door labelled “Governors’ En-
trance”. Mr Voigt doesn’t remember
which Governor it was but back in the
old days we had a Governor who didn’t
like to be seen coming in the front en-
trance, so they fixed this side door for
him. It’s been a good gimmick to retain
the tradition.
Actually Archibald Menzies first
opened his private family hotel, an
establishment of extreme respectability,
on March 14, 1853, and accommodation
was a pretty solid £3 12s. 6d. a week.
Apart from this goldmine, Archibald
Menzies did very well out of a goldmine
at Rushworth, and in 1867 he built on
the present site at the corner of Bourke
and William Streets. The builder was
David Mitchell, Nellie Melba’s father.
Addressing himself to “the squatters of
Victoria and Riverina”, Menzies an-
nounced that “in order to keep pace
with the growing wealth and importance
of the southern metropolis” his central
and spacious premises would be opened
on November 11.
jl/fENZiES still love to paddle their list of
names. They had Mark Twain, who
apparently startled everybody by stoking
the furnaces as part of a keep-fit cam-
paign. They had Melba, Alexander
Graham Bell, Herbert Hoover before he
became President, Edward Terry, Dion
Boucicault, Ella Russell, Harry Furnis, to
say nothing of Paderewski. Now Pade-
rewski, after being a guest in 1904, wrote
in his memoirs that his apartment was
comfortable but the food “simply in-
describable”. At first, he says, he and
Mme Paderewski lived almost entirely on
pineapples. Then they went to the mar-
kets every morning and Madame cooked
their food in the rooms.
General MacArthur made Menzies
his headquarters in 1942, and with a
staff of 30, occupied 2i floors. Danny
Kaye stayed, and so did Mr and Mrs
Mike Todd. When Mike and Liz arrived
the crowd was so thick in Bourke Street
the driver had to take the car half way
up Menzies’ steps to get them safely
inside.
The place goes on. Next week Mr
Voigt is opening “The Carvery” where
guests will be able to carve off their
own meat in the style of Simpsons in
the Strand. Let’s hope it appeals to the
squatters of Victoria and Riverina.

On the Margin
Accentuating the Positive
A cable news item referred to a
student magazine in Britain
entitled Couth. This is one of the
words which the Society for the Re-
storation of Lost Positives (founded
in the USA) has been striving to bring
into general use. I called on Mr
James Ampersand, secretary of the
Australian branch of the society, and
asked him to talk about its activities.
“I’m glad to say that couth is
steadily gaining in popularity,” he
said. “There is an obvious need for
it. The proportion of couth people is
increasing all the time. Another word
we would like to see in use is kempt,
but it is not doing so well. Unfortu-
nately it does not appeal much to
young people. Very few of them are
kempt today.”
I asked if he had any other good
positives coming up.
“We are working on scrutable at
the moment,” he said. “It is a handy
word for describing a distinctive
modern type—the scrutable Oriental.
Many Asian countries now are eager
to be scrutinised. The Cambodian
information service, for example,
sends handouts all over the world.
They are typically scrutable Orientals,
the Cambodians.”
Mr Ampersand consulted a file on
his desk.
“Another type that needs a positive
is the trepid airman,” he said. “He is
more common than many of us
think.”
I agreed, having been a trepid air-
man myself.
“Actually, the airlines like their
pilots to have a certain degree of
trepidity. It makes them more care-
ful,” he continued. “You know,
some of the groups that have lost
their positives are among the largest
in the community. Take the peccably
dressed men —one sees them every-
where. The same is true of imitably
humorous speakers; clubs and bars
are full of them.
“Then there are the many citizens
who show domitable courage in
adversity. Not to mention those who
emerge scathed from their ordeals
and accidents.”
I said:. “I have noticed that one
often meets women who are resistibly
attractive.”
“That is so,” he replied. “And their
husbands, as likely as not, are assum-
ing fellows who can be relied on to
remain perturbable in a crisis.”
“Would you say, Mr Ampersand,”
I asked, “that the relations of the
sexes could be described better with
the aid of lost positives?”
“I am glad you mentioned that,”
he said. “There is no field where the
need is greater. Let us say that a
young man is introduced to a sightly
girl. He impresses her favorably by
his gainly manner and reckful driving.
“On making further advances, he is
plussed to find that she is quite
nocent. Before long he has broken
down her pregnable defences. His
behavior is speakably caddish.
“In due course they marry. Their
life at first is expressibly happy, but
later they drift apart. He will go to
the club for an evening of bridled
licence, while she bosoms herself of
her secrets. Like many wives, she
develops an attitude of placable hos-
tility.”
“Mr Ampersand,” I said, “your
society is doing fine work by restoring
lost positives. But have you given
thought to the need for new negatives?
Surely, for example, there should be
an adjective to describe the Aussie
who is not dinkum. I mean the type
of man who likes wine with meals
instead of beer, does not play two-up,
and never fights policemen. One sees
him sometimes at parties, talking to
women.”
He nodded. “We are aware of the
lack of certain negatives. The case
you mention, of the non-dinkum
Aussie, is a ticklish one. It calls for
completely new thinking.
“However, my assistants have made
useful contributions on the negative
side. One of them thought of a term
to describe a well-to-do person who
becomes a beatnik a downstart.
Another produced underwrought, a
word applied to someone who is head-
ing away from a nervous breakdown.
“Bookshops asked for a word for
novels that are not pornographic. We
came up with parthenography, from
the Greek for a virgin. Several shops
have small parthenography depart-
ments now, in which they keep books
like Anne of Green Gables.”
It was encouraging to learn that
experts like Mr Ampersand are work-
ing hard to improve the language. I
came away with a feeling of repres-
sive cheerfulness.

If you want to speak to someone in Alaska or send an urgent
message to Zanzibar or Yap or Liverpool or Osaka, O.T.C.
ensures that you do so with the minimum of trouble and cost.
For that is our business—to provide the most efficient com-
munications channels between Australia and almost anywhere
in the world. Since our establishment in 1946 as the national
body responsible for all public overseas communications, O.T.C.
has taken full advantage of every technological development to
ensure for the Australian community the best possible service
at all times of the day and night. By installing advanced equip-
ment and utilising modern techniques, O.T.C. has been able to
surmount the difficulties sometimes encountered in operating
over shortwave radio links on which Australia was largely
dependent for so long. O.T.C. has also played a major role in
the introduction to the southern hemisphere of the new coaxial
submarine cable system which now links
Australia, New Zealand, Fiji,
Hawaii and Western Canada and, via Canada and the
Atlantic Ocean, with Britain and Europe. This large-capacity
Commonwealth owned and operated coaxial cable system has
already revolutionised communications between these points,
and will soon extend these high-grade services into South-
East Asia. Through all these developments in both cable and
radio, O.T.C. has been able to set new standards, both in
volume and quality, to extend existing services, and to intro-
duce new facilities of particular benefit to the business com-
munity. Today, O.T.C. operates through a vast international
network of cable and radio communications links to all points
of the compass. And whatever tomorrow may promise in new
forms of communications, O.T.C. is today studying their
potentialities to advance still further the efficiency
of Australia’s overseas communications services.

OVERSEAS
The Misfits of Rhodesia
Blowing one’s nose on the Union Jack
IN the low, white building huddled
among Salisbury’s skyscrapers that
is Southern Rhodesia’s Parliament,
an angry Government member jumped
from his seat under a full-length portrait
of Queen Elizabeth to interrupt a Scot-
tish Opposition member’s pointed attack
on Mr Smith’s policies with the taunt:
“The honorable member was a misfit
in Glasgow, is that why he came here?”
The bitterness of the interruption is
characteristic of debates in the once-staid
Legislative Assembly these days as the
powerful extremist Rhodesian Govern-
ment headed by Mr lan Smith, battles
its Crisis-way forward towards indepen-
dence and unchallengeable white suprem-
acy. The nature of the taunt is no less
characteristic. It came, in fact, im-
mediately after an Opposition spokes-
man had described many members of
the Government itself as misfits, in that
“they have never understood the world
in which they live”.
Such a taunt would especially irritate
members of the Rhodesian Front. More
and more lately they seem to think of
themselves as the country’s only true
patriots. Front propaganda has pumped
for months the line that opposition to
Mr Smith is tantamount to an un-
patriotic act. The efforts of the Grand
Old Man of Rhodesian politics, Sir Roy
Welensky, to return to Parliament to
oppose the Front were largely frustrated
by the success of Front speakers’ in-
sinuations that in some way he was
letting the country down.
At any moment now one expects to
hear the expression “un-Rhodesian”
applied, McCarthy-like, to anyone who
suggests that independence snatched
through rebellion against Britain would
lead to a catastrophic political and
economic isolation.
In fact, Southern Rhodesia’s Europeans
are a diverse lot; it is hard to say who
is a misfit or who is not. African
nationalists, who call them “settlers”,
would say that they all are.
Many Front members are unmistak-
ably British in well-cut London-tailored
suits and club ties. The accents of St
James drawl across the smoking-room;
cucumber sandwiches are eaten on the
members’ lawn. It is strange for a
visitor to hear the same accents raised
angrily in debate, demanding to know
of an Opposition member: “Why don’t
you speak for Rhodesia? Why are you
always talking for Britain?”, or referring
contemptuously to the British Govern-
ment as “those people”.
Front Ministers are quite ready to
explain that they are prepared to resist
to the last breath any African progress
towards political integration, whatever
any British Government may do. They
tend to refer to the African members of
Parliament as “those black bums”. One
senior Government official took me aside
in my hotel to talk it over. His accent
was upper-class; he wore the tie of a
British Cavalry regiment on his pin-
striped shirt.
He said: “I can tell you this, old boy,
we have to keep the African in his
place. He’s nice enough in his own way
in his own environment. But it has to
be faced: American sociologists have
proved that the Negro, Kaffir, African
call him what you will —has a smaller
brain-pan than yours and mine. No
amount of education will change that.
“Frankly, old chap, I have to admit
that I’m worried about the African birth-
rate. They’re indefatigable breeders.
The black population will double here in
20 years or so and what can you do
about that? But I don’t mind saying
that if the Front’s policy fails it’s an
experiment, after all and we’re over-
run, I for one will happily go down on
my estate blazing into the black hordes
with my two finest shotguns, and I expect
my loyal African loader will be at my
shoulder as usual. All sounds a bit
Gotterdammerung to you, I suppose, but
there you are. What else could I do?”
This particular Front leader is ex-
tremely rich and no doubt has money
abroad. He probably could, in fact, do
something quite different. He could, for
instance, go and live comfortably in
South Africa or South Kensington. It
is this fact that separates the Front
leaders from many of their most avid
supporters. “Gentlemen” Frontmen are
few. Some cruel but observant person,
referring to the type of British settler in
Kenya and Rhodesia, has said that
Kenya was for officers, Rhodesia for
other ranks.
It/fucH Front support comes from the
many British working-men who dar-
ingly immigrated soon after the war. They
gave up jobs as garage mechanics or
factory workers in smoggy Birmingham
or Cardiff to invest their savings and
hopes in small businesses 8000 miles
away, in Salisbury or Bulawayo. They
live now in comfortable bungalows in
suburbs lined with jacaranda and
bougainvillia; they have swimming pools
in the garden and at least one car in
the garage. They pay little tax, earn
good money and have African servants.
They have never had it so good.
They have a deep contempt for, and
a deeper fear of, the African. If in
Britain they would probably vote solidly
Labor, here they spit hatred at the
British Government.
They are typified, in part, by the
Scottish garage mechanic who last week

marched into the British High Com-
missioner’s office in Salisbury, drew a
small Union Jack from his pocket and
deliberately blew his nose on it.
Rhodesia’s farming community lives
too far away to indulge in gestures of
this sort. But the Front has strong
support from them, too. Many are
Afrikaners. Farms can vary from 2000
to 100,000 acres, or more. Tough, rough
and tanned, these Fronters often treat
their African employees better than the
English townsmen. But in packed bars
in the wild, remote Lowveld it is not
unusual to hear a farmer bragging of
how he “put a couple of rounds of shot
into the backside of a Kaffir” found
trespassing recently.
Tn one such country bar, a young
A English policeman from Streatham
told me he wanted to resign soon.
“There's no justice for the African down
here, you know. If an African gets shot
like that he won’t get satisfaction from
the law. The white man’s word goes here.
In our police station, if an arrested
Kaffir won’t confess to the white officer,
he's turned over to the black constables.
They beat the daylight out of him in a
back room. Personally, I can’t stand it.
Although, of course, the Kaffir’s got to
be kept in his place.”
It’s ironical that some of the oldest
white inhabitants see most clearly the
necessity of a “phasing-in” of Africans
into politics. They see that there are
hundreds of educated or semi-educated
Africans who will not be suppressed for
ever. They condemn the Front for
destroying moderation,
There are a number who agree with
them: Army officers who have taken
vows of loyalty to the Queen; most of
Rhodesia’s judges and lawyers, uni-
versity professors and a good many
businessmen. Whether they can be more
accurately described as “misfits” than
“old school tie” members of the Front
leadership, angry artisans from England
or rich, slouch-hatted farmers in the
bush is doubtful.
Sir Roy Welensky is no “way out”
Liberal; he has no great love for the
African himself; he certainly is no
advocate of “one man, one vote” or
African majority rule. But the fact that
Welensky, born in Rhodesia, can be
accused by many people as “un-Rhode-
sian” because he opposes the white-rule-
forever of Mr Smith, is a
tribute of sorts to the power of Front
propaganda. It is also symptomatic of
European fear in the face of a complex
political world that few here can under-
stand.
But Rhodesia is not the only place in
the world where careful long-term
political and moral arguments have been
lejected in favor of simple short-term
selfish personal interest, (ofns)

The short , beautiful dream of
European unity
By EMERY BARCS
very Monday at 2 p.m. the 40
H members of the French Academy
of Moral and Political Sciences
which is one of the five academies of the
lnstitut de France, founded in 1795
meet for discussions in their palace facing
the Seine.
Membership of the academies is the
greatest honor France can bestow on
her men of letters, artists, scientists and
other sages. To be chosen an associe
etranger is the highest compliment the
French academic elite can pay to a
foreigner. At present “foreign associ-
ates” of the Academy of Moral and
Cultural Sciences include Sir Winston
Spencer Churchill (1944) and Dwight D.
Eisenhower (1950). On Monday, Novem-
ber 9, Germany’s ex-Chancellor, Konrad
Adenauer, joined the ranks of the chosen.
Elis trip to Paris gave the 89-year-old
creator of the German Federal Republic
a chance to meet his friend, President
Charles de Gaulle, and to talk over with
him the painful subject of strained
Franco-German relations.
Dr Adenauer has done more than any
German living or dead to end his
country’s traditional feud with France.
The culmination of his effort was the
Franco-German treaty of friendship
and co-operation which came into force
on January 22, 1963.
Since then “Der Alte” has made no
secret of his intention to play the part
of a powerful watchdog in West German
politics.
But he has become much more. His
dislike and distrust of his successor,
Professor Ludwig Erhard, and of Foreign
Minister Gerhard Schroeder have
elevated him to the rank of the biggest
nuisance in West German politics. He
has become the spirit us rector of the
minority Gaullist faction within the
CDU/CSU against the “Atlantics” led by
the Erhard-Schroeder team which has
tried during the past year to combine a
friendly and close policy towards France
with an even tighter co-operation with
the US.
The change in Franco-German rela-
tions since January, 1963, has certainly
disappointed de Gaulle. The French
leader probably banked on Bonn’s
willingness to play the part of a junior
partner to Paris. And as long as
Adenauer—who shares de Gaulle’s dis-

like of “Anglo Saxons”—was in power
such hopes were quite justified.
Erhard and Schroeder have been much
less accommodating. Sure they wanted
to build a united Europe .vith France
but not at the price of giving up the
American protective umbrella Sure they
welcomed increasing French military
strength but not to the extent of helping
financially de Gaulle’s force de frappe.
They wanted the European Economic
Community to succeed but without
lowering German wheat prices. Finally
they have clung to NATO which de
Gaulle believes has had its day.
Only last week General Heinz Trett-
ner, Inspector-General of the German
armed forces, and General Earle G.
Wheeler, chairman of the joint US
Chiefs of Staff got together in Washing-
ton and reached “large areas of agree-
ment” on NATO defences.
Whether the French will really con-
front Erhard and Schroeder with the
alternative of choosing between Paris
and Washington is hard to say. The two
French demands addressed to West Ger-
many seem to lead towards such a show-
down. These demands are: German
assent to a common farm policy in the
EEC and Germany’s dissociation from
the planned Multilateral Force (MLF)
for NATO.
Briefly the issues at stake are these:
Before the EEC can reach agree-
ment on a common farm policy West Ger-
many must reduce the heavily subsidised
price of wheat which it pays to its
farmers from about £46 a ton to not
more than £42 a ton, which then would
become the Common Market wheat
price.' This new price would be a >out
£4 more a ton than the French grower
can expect to reach now.
Protection and Government support
for the wheat farmer vary in every
country of the Community. They are
highest in West Germany and lowest in
France where the price the farmer
receives is also the lowest in the EEC.
What the de Gaulle regime expects to
achieve from a common EEC wheat
price combined with a common pro-
tective food tariff for the Six would
exclude most overseas Wheat imports and
would give France the chance of be-
coming the Community's bread basket.
On the other hand what the French
farmer would gain the German farmer
would lose to the tune of about £lOO
million annually. Some 9 per cent of the
West German electorate consists of
peasants. So far they have been
staunchly conservative voters. If they
switched their allegiance to the Social
Democrats who have been gaining
votes to an impressive degree at the
recent State elections—they could give
them those 60 or 70 seats which would
shove Herr Willy Brandt into the Chan-
cellorship after the elections due next
September.
*ThtE Multilateral Force has been de-
•*- veloped to give NATO members a
greater sense of togetherness and a
limited right to hold their fingers on the
atomic trigger. MLF would consist of
a fleet of 25 vessels of 10,000 tons each.
The ships would look like merchantmen
to make detection more difficult. Each
ship would be equipped with eight
Polaris A-3 missiles which carry a
nuclear warhead and have a range of
2500 sea miles. At least three nations
would supply the complement of each
ship. Total costs would amount to
£l2OO million of which the US would
pay 40 per cent, West Germany 30 per
cent, Britain and Italy 10 per cent each
and the rest would be shared by smaller
NATO members who wished to par-
ticipate in the project.
De Gaulle rejected MLF as a hare-
brain and unworkable idea. But he did
not object to German participation,
probably believing that the project
would die on the planning board.
Recently, however, and especially since
British interest in the scheme, de Gaulle
discovered that if the Germans really
became partners in MLF they would
(a) infringe on the Franco - Germany
treaty of 1963 and (b) would in fact help
the US to divide Europe.
What Herr Adenauer said to Presi-
dent de Gaulle in Paris is still a secret.
But two days after “Der Alte” returned
from Paris, he held a closed meeting with
Chancellor Erhard and with the leaders
of the CDU/CSU. After the session a
Government spokesman announced that
(a) as a conciliatory gesture to France
West Germany would not press for the
immediate setting up of MLF al-
though it would still participate in the
project and (b) Germany will not lower
its wheat price either in 1965 or 1966.
The 22-month-old baby of special
Franco - German relationship is very
sick indeed. Whether anybody, includ-
ing the new associe etranger of the
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences
can save it from death no one can
answer. But if it dies, a short, beautiful
dream of greater European unity will be
buried with it.

WINES TO BUY
The Fruits of Six
Months’ Tasting
This is my first list since May. If I
rave on, remember that it is the
summary of six months of tasting,
and the original purpose of this column
was to find you WINES TO BUY.
TINTARA 265 Cabinet Claret 1959.
-—Made by the master mixers, the people
who have always been proud of their
blending. Using wines from many dif-
ferent regions, their aim is to produce
no one specific regional character, but
rather a distinctive, and sometimes
distinguished, “cellar” style. Such a
distinguished wine is Bin 265. A lovely
light claret style, with good flavor and
balance. The nose is good though
perhaps slight in volume, and there is
still plenty of tannin evident. This tannin
is not harsh, however, and the wine can
only improve for a while yet.
PENFOLDS Graves 289 1954. — Un-
available except perhaps in small num-
bers at the back of the top shelf. Blended
at Minchinbury from South Australian
and Hunter Semilion. Worthy of men-
tion because it's the nearest thing I’ve
ever tasted to true French Graves (of
the sweet style), showing a lightness and
delicacy in sweetness quite unlike the
coarse cloyness so often associated with
Australian sweet table w'ines. A lovely,
soft, rather dry finish.
LINDEMAN’S 2020 Chablis 1962.—
Made from Verdelhao grapes grown on
the Sunshine flat in the Hunter Valley.
This is one of the grape types used in
making wine in Madeira, and, in fact,
the Hunter locals call it by this name.
But the drink is the thing and in the
Hunter, a table, not fortified, wine is
the result. Always big and pungent, it
is usually required to “lift” less flavor-
some whites. This vintage, however, the
wine was so good it had to be bottled
separately. It’s not really a Chablis, for
it’s too full-bodied; it’s not really a White
Burgundy, because it’s not round or vel-
vety enough. Definitely for those who
like to taste what they're drinking.
ORLANDO Trebbiano 1958.— Almost
as interesting and certainly as unusual as
the above. There is a ton of flavor in
this relatively new style, vintaged at
Rowland Flat by Gramps. The color is
magnificent and the aroma lives up to
this standard. Only on the finish does
the wine disenchant, for it is rather
coarse. Possibly in subsequent vintages
they have done something about this.
TYRELLS Dry Red Vat 5 1963.
Good young Hunter with nicely develop-
ing nose and flavor. Rather high acidity,
but in balance. There seems no doubt
that reds from this vineyard have their
own special tannin character which is
not always evident in other Hunters.
McWILLIAMS Maria Riesling 1959.
—Most well-made Hunter Semilions de-
velop with age from a Chabiis to a White
Burgundy style. Occasionally one tries
a wine of this nature that is so good it
denies all arguments against it, and this
is such a wine. Beautiful nose, finish and
balance, with an outstanding round, soft,
full “throw in all the adjectives’’ flavor.
ALL SAINTS Light Amontillado
Sherry. Made by George Sutherland
Smith at Wahgunyah, North Victoria,
from Palamino and Marsaone grapes
grown on the property. The wine spends
one year on Flor, then two years in 500-
gallon casks. Finally it is blended with
a ten-year-old Amontillado which has
been kept in Spanish 25-gallon casks,
The result is an aperitif <Df distinction,
showing excellent Spanish character and
flavor.
PENFOLDS Cabernet Mataro 630
1960. I remember an experimental
blend of the same grapes made by this
company in 1955 at Auldana, and
drunk with much pleasure some seven
years later. This may well be a counter-
part. At this stage there is a rather high
acidity and tannin apparent, but the nose
and flavor are developing so well it
definitely becomes a bated breath job.
Put down and watch and pray to
Bacchus.
BURINGS Chateau Leonay Vintage
Rhine Riesling 1963. —Perhaps the best
of the Rhine Riesling I’ve tasted this
year, and apparently the judges agree.
Pronounced varietal character showing
typical flowery fruit flavor. Excellent
balance with lovely crisp finish. From
the Barossa Valley, this is just the thing
for a hot summer’s afternoon, or a cold
summer’s afternoon, or a cold winter’s
afternoon, or a . . .
McWILLIAMS Pin o t Hermitage
1961. An immensely interesting wine.
Penfolds and Seppelts were the pioneers
in the extensive use of small oak for early
maturation and they applied it to mostly
South Australian and Victorian wines.
Now Macs have done it with a Hunter
wine, and the result promises much.
Six months ago the oak was far too ag-
gressive and the makers wondered. Now,
though this flavor is still dominant, it is
less evident all the time and the lovely
Pinot character is coming through. It is
interesting to note that the great French
Burgundies spend their initial incubation
in new small oak (and, as everyone
knows, they are made from Pinot), and
it could be that here we have a future
classic Burgundy of the delicate lighter
style. On the other hand, it could be a
complete flop, and you could chew
acorns for life!

BEWARE!
Like walking through a minefield blindfolded
From a South African Correspondent
One of the greatest mistakes the free
world has made in recent years
has been the failure to give credit
to a section of the South African Press
for its unremitting attack, not only on
the race policies of the Nationalist
Government, but also on the gradual and
insidious relegation of the English-speak-
ing culture and way of life to inferior
status.
In this respect, it is as though the
Afrikaner nationalist has said to him-
self: “We need the English-speaking
people for their business and industrial
ability, their financial acumen and their
numbers against overwhelming black
population. For that reason we must
tolerate and patronise their-language and
their culture and accept them as allies.
But quietly and without fuss, they must
learn that we Afrikaners are the real
South Africans.”
Courageous newspaper editors like
Horace Flather, former editor of the
Johannesburg “Star” saw through this
years ago and used his newspaper to
make the English-speaking people aware
of it. He began to debunk, too, the
apartheid ideology soon after the
Nationalists took power in 1948.
Another journalist of great courage is
Laurance Gandar, editor of the “Rand
Daily Mail”, whose signed editorials are
more outspokenly critical of apartheid
and the Government’s race policy than
anything said or written anywhere in
the world.
These men, in the face of mounting
abuse and threats, have behaved in a way
that has earned them a high place in
the history of the world’s free Press.
But, if the signs are read correctly,
even they and the journalists like them
in South Africa, are approaching the end
of the line. When Parliament meets in
Cape Town for its next session in
January, the wordy report of the South
African Press Commission will provide
the Government with the means to curb
unbridled criticisms in South Africa and
to prevent, as far as it can, the spread
of this criticism abroad.
Furthermore, the Government has
created the right climate for the enact-
ment of laws to curb the Press. For
months now it has turned all the big guns
of its own Press and the Government-
controlled Broadcasting Commission
(there are no privately-owned radio
stations in South Africa) on the English
language Press and the correspondents
who serve overseas newspapers. There
have been inspired demands at National-
ist Party rallies for “action against the
Press”, and Cabinet Ministers have even
promised that action of some sort will
be taken.
Horace Flather, now retired, has just
attacked this “raucous abuse” of the
Press that continues and which gives
the impression of a campaign to pave
the way for the abolition of voluntary
control and the introduction of control
by a statutory body. “I imagine such a
body would be a tool of the Govern-
ment. It would undoubtedly signify the
advent of official control of the Press,”
he said.
To try to explain this preoccupation
with the Press in South Africa, one must
go back to 1948 when the Nationalists,
with the magic word of “apartheid” were
elected to power with a majority of only
three members. Whatever they say now,
their election slogan freely translated
was: “The nigger in his place,” and they
set out without delay to implement it.
The English-language Press reacted
sharply and with sustained attack.
Foreign correspondents based in South
Africa gave their newspapers factual
and progressive reports of the workings
of apartheid which, although it had been
practised in South Africa for 300 years,
was now being highlighted by the
Nationalists as a God-inspired means of
preserving White civilisation on the
African continent.
But, for 16 years, the English-language
Press of South Africa with its traditional
high standard, has led the assault on the
evils of apartheid until, without changing
its policy, the Nationalist Government
has virtually outlawed the magic word,
apartheid, and substituted the nice-sound-
ing phrase of “separate development”,
which means the same thing, anyway.
Nevertheless, South Africa soon be-
came the “polecat of the free world” (to
use a phrase coined by the Nationalist
newspaper, “Die Burger”) and the
English - language newspapers were
named as the culprits. They were accused,
not only of attacking the Government,
but also of feeding their “poison” to
foreign correspondents who, because they
could not read the pro-Government
Afrikaans newspapers were said, there-
fore, to have based their despatches on
reports in the English Press.
Furthermore, the English Press had
in its employ dozens of staff corres-
pondents who served as “stringers” for
the foreign Press and helped to carry
the attack against apartheid overseas.
This added up to a powerful assault on
that esoteric Afrikaner institution which
is the National Government and some-
how it had to be stopped, without the
stigma of outright Press censorship.
Under the brilliant direction of Hol-
land-born Dr Hendrik Verwoerd (even
before he became Prime Minister), a two-
pronged attack on the English Press
was mounted. Dr Verwoerd was an
expert on the Press. Through the war
years and before the Nationalists came
to power, he was editor of the Nation-
alist mouthpiece in the Transvaal, “Die
Transvaler”, which opposed the fight
against Nazi Germany and there is on
record in South Africa a Supreme Court
judgment to the effect that he made his
newspaper “a tool of the Nazis in South
Africa and he knew it”.
Dr Verwoerd’s designed attack was
first a Press Commission which would
find that the English Press had abused
its privilege and that “stringers” and
foreign correspondents had acted with
bias against the Afrikaner. And secondly,
while the commission laboriously tackled
its costly assignment, Dr Verwoerd and
the law-makers set about strangling the
English Press with a mass of legislation
that prompted even Horace Flather to
declare publicly that editing a news-
paper in South Africa was like “walking
through a minefield blindfolded”.
As one set of laws after the other
affecting the Press was enacted, Dr
Verwoerd’s own newspapers, his govern-
ment - controlled radio; his Cabinet
Ministers and even his backbenchers in
and out of Parliament, maintained a
barrage of vitriolic accusation against
the English Press, foreign correspondents
and “stringers”.
Today, reporters must wade through
a list of hundreds of names of people
who may not be quoted. They must have
at their fingertips a mass of legislation
that if unwittingly contravened, carries
penalties ranging from flogging to three
or more years’ imprisonment. If they
are seen too frequently talking to
Africans suspected by the authorities of
being African politicians, they risk being

Special branch policemen pound the
corridors of newspaper offices asking
fatuous questions, merely as a form of
intimidation. In the newspaper offices
themselves, lawyers are as important as
the journalists. Reporters’ copy is
screened and re-screened for opinion and
statements without quoted source. Per-
sonal contacts built up by reporters over
a period of years have closed their doors,
and their mouths. Too many people are
looking over their shoulders before they
talk politics, and too many newspaper
editors have begun taking the easy way
of jettisoning copy that would incur
Government censure.
Such is the state of the South African
Press today, and poised over it is the
Press Commission’s Report which has
taken 13 years to compile. The report
itself has everything expected of it by
the Government. Skilfully, it evaded the
task of reporting on the South African
Press per se, largely because the English-
language Press is as good as any to be
found in the world.
Instead, it limited the result of 13
years of endeavor to wholesale con-
demnation of the foreign correspondents
and “stringers” whose sins were not
that there was so much false or in-
accurate material in their despatches,
but that they failed to apply sufficient
emphasis to the viewpoint of the
Afrikaner and the Nationalist Govern-
ment. In short, reporting by corres-
pondents had been biased in favor of
human rights, in favor of civil liberties
for all men and in favor of the main-
tenance of the rule of law.
To achieve their conclusions, the
tribunal that went under the name of a
Press Commission ordered correspon-
dents to appear as “voluntary” witnesses
and they were treated as though they
were on trial. They were asked a series of
questions that left little doubt in their
minds about how the commission would
classify them.
Long before the report was presented,
Dr Verwoerd and his Government, im-
patient at the delay, moved in their own
way against the men responsible for
letting the outside world learn the truth
about events in South Africa. Threats
and intimidation had their effect.
Newspaper managements displayed an
ominous interest in those staff writers
who served the overseas Press. Many
of these journalists saw the writing on
the wall and quit their overseas connec-
tions. American staff correspondents in
the country were expelled and those
washing to enter the Republic were
denied entry permits. British correspon-
dents moved out until foreign coverage
was left in the hands of a few news
agencies and those South African cor-
respondents still courageous enough to
operate.
Police v Press f
¥7or several years now, relations be-
tween the English Press and the civil
service have steadily deteriorated. De-
partmental heads are reluctant to give
out information on even seemingly un-
important issues. Some Cabinet Ministers
have gone so far as to break off relations
altogether with certain newspapers.
Most significant of all, has been the
contempt with which rank - and - file
policemen treat English-speaking news-
papermen. True enough, senior officers
behave correctly when interviewed in
their offices, but reporters must be
extremely wary should they be on the
sidelines of, say, a racial disturbance or
riot. There have been too many in-
stances of reporters having been man-
handled, abused and even arrested, while
trying to do an honest job of reporting.
An English-speaking photographer and
reporter, for example, were threatened
with arrest some time ago for “tres-
passing” in a police station. They had
merely walked out on to the balcony
where the officer-in-charge, surrounded
by 10 or more of his men, was address-
ing through a loud hailer, a group of
African women who had come to the
police station to protest against some
apartheid law.
On another occasion a few years ago,
when a photographer protested to a
young Afrikaner policeman about the
way he was manhandling a pregnant
African woman in broad daylight out-
side the Johannesburg City Hall, he was
arrested, accused of being the unborn
child’s father and flung into the cells
for the night. More recently, several
newspaper photographers were arrested
because, while photographing a street
demonstration they, by mere chance,
had a police station lock-up in the back-
ground. It is an offence to photograph
a South African prison from any angle.
Unfortunately for South Africa, the
Press proprietors allowed incidents like
these to pass without serious challenge.
The result has been that the Press
generally, has gradually been treated to
a display of contempt not to be found
anywhere else in the free democratic
world. Now that some form of statutory
control seems certain, these same pro-
prietors are pleading with the Govern-
ment to allow them to control them-
selves. They are too late, and must now
pay the penalty for having kept their
peace too long.
The Government is going to act, all
right, but the control they will exercise
over the South African Press will be as
nothing when compared to the restric-
tions they will place on the foreign
correspondents and “stringers”. One
suggestion already made is that all
journalists will have to be registered in
the same way as doctors, dentists and
attorneys are. Any infringement of the
code (which would be drawn up by the
Government) would result in a journalist
being scratched off the roll like any
doctor who commits abortion, or any
attorney who misuses trust funds. There
would be no appeal against this, and
unregistered journalists who practised
would incur heavy penalties. It is
possible, too, that many “stringers” now
operating would not be given registra-
tion as overseas correspondents. As it is,
cabled despatches are already being
scrutinised and South African newspaper-
men, who act as correspondents, are
resorting to devious methods for getting
their reports out of the country.
The State Information Department
studies reports on South Africa in over-
seas newspapers, tries to trace their
origin and curtly expresses to individual
correspondents its disapproval of those
despatches which reflect badly on South
Africa.

Letters to the Editor
The Death Penalty
SIR. —No abolitionist is necessarily in-
volved in the view that life imprisonment
(and this applies only to criminals “too
dangerous to be released”) is more
humane than execution; but whether or
not it is, isn’t the point simply that it
might be, that while life no matter how
unworthy is preserved, the exercise of
humanity is possible? And is it too much
to say that the exercise of humanity is
our duty, and that the failure to follow
that duty is what we complain of in
murderers and rapists? One of the main
arguments against execution, as Mr
Gordon Hawkins knows very well, is its
general brutalising effect; that is why the
abolitionist does not have to hold that
life imprisonment is more humane than
execution. Imprisonment is, in our
society, at least an established institution;
execution, when it occurs, ruptures and
sends a shock through society: the victim
is one figure only: someone, at a speci-
fied time, will calculatedly take the life
of someone else and others we will
be the spectators.
On the argument about “deterrent
value”, Mr Hawkins emphasises that the
truth is that there is “no reliable evidence
one way or the other”. But when Mr
Hawkins goes on to cite Sir James
Stephens’ pronouncement that the deter-
rent force may consist in the building up
in the community (by the death penalty)
of a feeling of “abhorrence for murder”
it becomes clear that the view that it is
a deterrent is, in fact, clung to. It is
still, however, impossible to prove that
there are any people who, as a result of
'their feeling of abhorrence, have been
deterred from committing murder. If
that could be proved would those who
support the death penalty argue for its
introduction (or at least for the intro-
duction of the lash) for lesser crimes?
It is all very well for Mr Hawkins to
-criticise the “emotion and sentimentality”
in such phrases as the “ghastly ritual”
of hanging and to compare that phrase
with J. Edgar Hoover’s reference to
“criminal beasts”. But while the latter
phrase is pure emotion, the description
of hanging as a “ghastly ritual” is surely
no less than the truth. Mr Hawkins will
remember that Mrs Thomson (of the
Thomson and Bywaters’ case) was carried
to the gibbet drugged and hysterical and
her hangman later committed suicide.

Peace Congress
SIR.—It was my first Peace Congress:
hut I have sufficient experience in student
politics in Melbourne to recognise
manipulations when I see them. I was
credentialled to the Academics’ section,
but was admitted to the Citizens’ and
Youth sections as well. The latter sec-
tions were both manipulated from above
and completely dominated by views I
have no hesitation in calling Communist.
The Academics’ section, however, was
run in a completely fair and open
manner: there was no discernible
manipulation. But Communist - in-
fluenced our section certainly was.
Firstly, all the motions which con-
tradicted Communist policies which
our group proposed were heavily de-
feated, and those passed, with one im-
portant exception, were either anti-
Western neutralist, or not important.
The conference rejected a motion that
a process of convergence between the
USA and the USSR would decrease the
risk of war. A motion declaring that
liberalisation of Communist societies was
essential for practicable disarmament,
and that therefore we should condemn
anti-liberal aspects such as the persecu-
tion of writers, intellectuals and Jews in
those countries was overwhelmingly de-
feated. The important exception was the
passing of a motion calling for free dis-
semination of pacifist literature in all
countries. Perhaps only its lack of
specificity got it through. An amend-
ment was proposed (again by our group)
to a motion that Communist China be
admitted to the UN, that at the same
time the UN should guarantee the
territorial and political integrity and
independence of Taiwan. This was
heavily defeated, and the original un-
amended motion then passed.
The meeting exhibited a “Munich
mentality 7 ’: repeatedly it was stressed
that the West ought place no conditions
on bargaining which would make agree-
ment with Communists difficult, but they
were ready for the sake of peace to
accept anything the other side stipulated
such as the sacrifice of Taiwan.

Academic Salaries
SIR.—It is desirable that there should
be some public debate on the question
whether the increases in salaries of Uni-
versity professors and readers, recom-
mended by Mr Justice Eggleston, and
accepted by the Federal Government, are
really necessary. It seems to me that
the great obstacle to maintaining high
academic and educational standards in
our universities is not the salaries of our
senior members, already high by the
standards of the community, but in-
adequate facilities for research and
teaching. As a mere instance, all uni-
versity libraries in Australia (like all our
other libraries) are more or less in-
adequate both for research in most sub-
jects and for the needs of undergraduate
teaching. Perhaps money may be better
spent on buying more books, and housing
them adequately, than on increasing
salaries.
Contrary to what academics may say,
particularly before salary tribunals, I
believe it is good conditions for re-
search and teaching that attracts and
holds men of ability to universities.
Certainly, the sort of person a university
wants is one for whom such conditions
are more important than his wages. But
if it is really true that in some subjects
higher salaries are the only way to
attract or retain a suitable staff, then it
might be considered whether the US
system of salaries fixed by individual
negotiation would not cover such cases.
Finally, the granting of increases only
to those least in need the senior staff
tends to perpetuate the hierarchical
structure of our universities. Should.we
not consider whether we do not need
more academic equality in our uni-
versities instead of less?

Senate-House Deadlocks
SIR. —The enthusiastic reception of Mr
G. Howatt’s 84-page report “Resolving
Senate-House Deadlocks in Australia
Without Endangering the Smaller States”
is hard to understand. Although the
Senate was set up to protect the rights
of the States, the Party system quickly
defeated this object. Senators do not
resolve issues by referring to how their
State will suffer or benefit but by refer-
ence to their Party’s policy on the issue.
Perhaps Mr Howatt could offer details
of the number of times Senators have
broken Party allegiance to vote in the
interest of their State?
His solution for solving deadlocks
would only make more of a mockery of
the Senate as “the States’ House” or
“protector of the smaller States”, and
his proposal would in effect make the
Senate the permanent preserve and
junior echo of the Government of the
day in the House of Representatives.
How he reconciles this with resolving
deadlocks without “reducing the power
of the Senate” is a mystery.

“High Church”
SIR.—Dr Barry Marshall in his letter
(The Bulletin, 7/11/64) has pointed
out four “errors” in my article on the
Liturgical Movement, which appeared
under the heading “High Church: On-
ward and Upward”. 1 admit to only one
of them —the Brotherhood of St Andrew.
It should have read “the Brotherhood of
St Paul.” Had Dr Marshall read my
article properly he would have seen that
in reference to the Jazz Mass I said “the
students at Trinity occasionally stage a
Jazz Mass . . . which replaces the 8.15
a.m. Mass on Sundays”. I am fully
aware that the Jazz Mass has been per-
formed only three times. My article
means that the Jazz Mass replaced the
normal 8.15 a.m. service on the
occasions which it has been used only!
I certainly didn’t imply that this hap-
pened every Sunday!
My article did not once say or imply


to make every occasion
a SPECIAL occasion...

that the Reverend Peter Bennie was a
member of the Parish and People Move*
ment, but that he is a supporter. One
can only presume he is since he appeared
recently (and with Dr Marshall, I might
add) at an NSW convention of the
Movement.
Dr Marshall (he calls himself “that
High Church fiend”, not I) again mis-
read my article re his appearance at St
Peter’s. I did not mean he was familiar
simply because of his number of ap-
pearances as Deacon, but because he is
a familiar figure to many Melburnians
through his frequent television appear-
ances. But the very fact that he has
officiated as Deacon at St Peter’s is
rather indicative of his “churchmanship”.

Jokes Wanted
SIR. —As part of an investigation of
Australian folk-narrative, I am making
a collection of jokes heard in Australia,
and would be very grateful for the assist-
ance of your readers. The jokes need
not deal with specifically Australian
characters or locales; it will be very
interesting to observe the changes which
occur in stories which have found their
way to Australia from other countries.
It would be helpful to know some brief
details of the circumstances in which
the contributor first heard the jokes—the
year, the nature of the narrator, and of
his audience.

Censorship Enquiry
SlR.—The state of censorship in Aus-
tralia today can be satisfactory to no
one. We have the classic situation
where the law no longer adequately re-
flects the balance of claims within the
society, and some citizens find them-
selves conscientiously impelled to defy
it. Surely at this point it is possible for
the various interest-groups involved to
recognise each other’s bona fides and
seek a workable compromise-situation.
As a first step, we would advocate
an inquiry into the whole field, which
is one where hard information is
notably lacking. What is the effect of
pornography on the personality? What
sort of changes in the law would be
acceptable to responsible literary
people? An enquiry that included
among its membership persons repres-
enting literature, clinical psychology,
the bookselling trade, education at dif-
ferent levels, criminology and the
churches would be able to clear up
some of the confusions that vitiate dis-
cussion at present; at least we might
learn what the various interest-groups
really have to say, in an atmosphere of
reasonableness and mutual goodwill.

LEGACY
REVIEWS
THEATRE
Fall of a Titan
By DAVID MARTIN
Man and Boy. Terence Rattigan. St Martin’s
/ Theatre, Mebourne.
A Thousand Clowns. Herb Gardner. Union
Theatre, Melbourne.
Terence Rattigan is an established prop
of the British entertainment industry.
This is no denigration, since the industry
also accommodates such diverse
attractions as the Blackpool tower and
the Edinburgh Festival. Mr Rattigan’s
contribution falls somewhere in the
middle, with a slight inclination towards
Blackpool.
There are two Rattigans, one thought-
ful —“The Winslow Boy”—and the other
frivolous, as in “French Without Tears”.
Both are eminently successful. The
formula for his serious work rarely
[changes. He takes a contro-
versial figure or event, usually
not of the immediate past, and
Idevelops from it something half-
Iway between a thriller and a
play of ideas. He gets his im-
pact through the thriller part,
having a healthy instinct for
Ithis department of drama, with
ideas thrown in as a bonus. The pre-
scription is effective as long as the two
Ingredients live amiably together, be-
cause it caters to two major but over-
lapping audiences.
The ideas do not have to be profound
lilt, of course, they have to be clear.
f7o add spice to the excitement they must
Isar some argument. In “Man and Boy”,
lowever, there is nothing to argue about.
There is an idea, but Rattigan doesn’t
seem to have bothered much about it:
like a grumbling appendix it makes its
presence negatively felt. This was bound
To damage structure and characterisation.
It might have been better to amputate.
Gregor Antonescu, with a few features
taken from Ivar Kreuger, is a confidence
trickster on the grand scale a phoney
world tycoon. He is called to reckoning
one night in 1934 in his illegitimate son’s
basement flat in Greenwich Village. The
hoy, Basil, is a mixed-up young Leftist
'who has every reason to hate his charm-
ing sire. This is one strand of the action:
The collison between corrupt power and
uncertain idealism. The other, far more
felling, is Antonescu’s final fling to save
jhis empire before, let down by his gaudy
Nfe and his closest collaborator, he
shoots himself. The link is provided by
'Miat the father does to the son. In a
desperate stratagem to gain support from
a rival millionaire, he insinuates that
Basil is available for pederastic diver-
sions. When at last all have deserted
Antonescu, Basil nevertheless has come
to admire him for what he thinks is his
courage. But the old man resists. He
fears affection and he wants the lad to
face reality.
It could be said that self-revelation is
a theme, were it not strangled in the coils
of far-fetched situations. The whole looks
dated; it would have made a deeper im-
pression in the ’thirties. A good deal of
what should happen off-stage is put
before us visibly but silently. It strains
credulity. Rattigan likes to operate on
the border-line of melodrama, but here,
especially at curtain moments, he often
crosses it. Only towards the
end does the story really grip,
but then it almost makes up for
what it lost.
Eric Reiman’s Antonescu
goes down solidly on the credit
side. Michael Joshua’s Basil
suffers by comparison, as always
when a softer character is not
given enough to do to make weakness
interesting. Max Bruch, as the pliable
henchman, makes his run rather too late.
Irene Mitchell, the producer, does not
appear to have been quite happy with her
task.
“One Thousand Clowns” is a high-
spirited spoof which delivers what it
promises. Murray Burns is that darling
of the American theatre, the outsize
individualist. An unemployable tele-
vision writer, he dwells in glorious chaos
with his thirteen-year-old nephew, Nick.
This youth has a genius IQ rating, but
the Child Welfare Department is on to
his uncle. One of its two representatives
is Sandra Markowitz, a beginner-
psychologist with a propensity for burst-
ing into tears. Our expectation that she,
rather than Murray and Nick, will be
saved is not disappointed.
The comedy’s target is the cosy world
of the “Reader’s Digest” and the
idiocies of commercial TV. The war
between these and Murray is waged with
terrific brio, marred only by the fact
that the hero himself at times resembles
“My Most Unforgettable Character”.
But when he doesn’t slide off into heart-
warming explanations of what the Free
Life is about, he has our complete
sympathy. The status quo is championed
by a fantastic creature called Leo Her-
man (played to a nicety by Malcolm
Robertson), one of the sickest and
funniest neurotics ever to star in a
children’s programme. His great scene
stops the show, though it cuts close to
the bone.
Kevin Colson makes more than an
agreeable farceur out of Murray, and
Rudolph Starosta is a child actor who
knows his stuff. Patricia Conolly, the
toast of Melbourne for her performance
in “After the Fall”, again does very well,
and I could not say whether it is the
nature of the girl or a memory of her
last part which makes her give us a
Miss Markowitz who could derive from
County Meath. John Sumner obviously
enjoyed himself: he lets his cast go for
the laughs, but since they do not come
from the belly this is just what is needed.
Crash of Symbols
Cages. Lewis John Carlino. Ensemble
Theatre, Sydney.
Lewis John Carlino’s double-bill “Cages”,
comes to the Ensemble with a crash of
symbols that can be heard from here to
Off-Broadway. Each play has two
characters, a man and a woman. The
chief character of the first, “Snowangel”,
is a prostitute with a heart of gold, and
of the second, “Epiphany”, a man with
latent homosexual tendencies. So there
you have Mr and Miss Theatrical Cliche
of 1964. The basic problem in both is,
naturally, failure to communicate. Like
most people who fail to communicate
they talk endlessly.
The extreme competence of the play-
ers, Patricia Jones and Brian Young,
really works against the plays. If they
had shown even the slightest embarrass-
ment with “Snowangel”, which is en-
tirely a trashy little melodrama, one
might have let it pass. And if they had
not in “Epiphany” worked so hard to
establish excruciating tension between a
man who’s trying to turn himself into
a rooster and his not unnaturally be-
wildered wife the play could have been
a lively fantasy, as one cannot doubt the
author intended it to be.
But the Ensemble’s characteristic sign-
posting, “This is significant”, “This is
serious”, “This is life”, misdirects the
proceedings. A programme note asks
that people who have seen the plays do
not reveal the ending of “Epiphany” to
their friends who have not seen it. It's
an awful choice between keeping faith
with the Ensemble or keeping your
friends. Perhaps loyalty demands that
you warn your friends.

The Mavis Bramston Show. Channel 7,
Sydney.
Seven Days: Sex and The Teenager. Chan-
nel 7, Sydney.
Four Corners: Channel 2, Sydney.
Channel 7’s new satirical comedy series
hardiy seems to be Australia’s answer to
TWTWTW, as we’d been led to expect.
The stream of advance publicity stres-
sed that the show would “send up
sacred cows”, but the satirical shafts fired
were generally rubber tipped.
In fact often the “sacred cows” a
phrase of which I'm getting heartily tired
were simply named, not commented
upon. The mere mention of Harry Jen-
sen, Menzies or General Motors was
expected to raise a laugh and did from
the obliging soundtrack.
Probably the show’s biggest trouble is
that as yet too many people have a hand
in it. The credit titles listed what looked
like about 50 names as writers; there are
occasional flashes of sharp wit in the
script, but the main mass of the mate-
rial pretty well extinguished them. With
fewer and more compatible scriptwriters,
with less reliance on elderly jokes and
with sharper cutting, the show might
develop an individual and piquant
flavor.
In any case the producers must get rid
of the fellow who decided that the show
must have “significance”, and perpetrat-
ed an embarrassing sequence in which
Gordon Chater scolded us for our treat-
ment of the aborigines, after which he,
Barry Creyton and Carol Raye, with the
smiles wiped clean off their faces, read
three pieces of Kath Walker’s verse.
Even the hysterical canned laughter was
silenced by this.
Though Gordon Chater is officially
the star, the honors go to Barry Creyton,
a polished and stylish comedian. His
tiny sequence as an ABC presentation an-
nouncer was one of the show's highlights
(and also one of the best written seg-
ments). Chater is more acceptable in
his character roles (League footballer,
Leading Chemist) than as compere or
solo performer, when his air of self-
satisfaction becomes rather repellent.
The show struck its lowest point when
Chater, singing an'interminable and in-
comprehensible song, broke eggs over
his own head and threw custard pies at
himself. This drove the studio laughter
to the mania point.
The first part of a “Seven Days” pro-
gramme, “Sex And The Teenager”, told
very little about either. The second part,
which just may make a definite state-
ment, was screened after going to
Press.
Since the first programme was very
much onside with the teenagers (“what
are the adults and the parents doing to
make things easier?” asked the pompous
introduction) it’s a pity that the pro-
ducers chose such an unhealthy, moth*
eaten lot of youngsters to illustrate their
point.
Anyway it turns out that it’s old par-
ties of “30 and over” who really indulge
in promiscuity. As far as teenagers are
concerned, “kissing is about all” and
even the ones who go wrong have been
corrupted by their elders, who “tell them
nothing” and subject them to the strain
of erotic movie ads “Tom Jones” of
all things was instanced and then
actually have sexual intercourse them-
selves, dirty old things!
The first “Four Corners” programme
since it's notorious recent troubles
dealt mainly with the US election result,
playing it safe by discussing almost ex-
clusively the defeat of Goldwater. The
programme included an imported fare-
well to the Windmill Theatre, and a care-
fully edited travelogue about the Ameri-
can installation at Exmouth. The violent
objections made to this project were dis-
creetly hinted at, but none of the vocal
opponents to it was interviewed. Michael
Charlton, please come home!

It would be all to the good if next
year's Sibelius centenary marked the
beginning of a fairer reassessment of
this composer, who seems to have been
dismissed altogether by the pundits
after the excessive enthusiasms of a gen-
eration ago. Sibelius can no longer be
held up as the true model for the 20th-
century composer (as he once was), but
he cannot justly be denied his place as
an individualist of undoubted power and
originality.
The spare, tight-lipped fourth sym-
phony is a good starting point for any
reappraisal, not only because it represents
Sibelius at his most Sibelian, but also
because its open texture and fragmenta-
tion of melody have much in common
with the most recent music ot today.
Ansermet in this new recording evokes
the tensely brooding quality of the slow
first and third movements so well that
one must assume that his surprisingly
deliberate tempos in the scherzo and
(more particularly) the final allegro are
thoughtfully considered choices.
In the last movement he may have felt
that the normal fast pace gives too fri-
volous an air to the cheerful opening


k theme after all the serious and austere
matter that has gone before.
r ( Nevertheless I find the faster tempo
i more convincing, and Ansermet’s per-
formance as a whole, despite its con-
„ siderable virtues, is less convincing than
' the earlier recording by Karajan,
j The Karajan recording, like this one,
the symphony with the last and
important of Sibelius’s symphonic
j poems (or all symphonic poems, for
[ /that matter), “Tapiola”. Here again
j/Karajan has the advantage, for the op-
j posite reason: Ansermet’s tempos are
too impatient, his approach too prosaic;
, Karajan captures much better the im-
, pression of eerie spaciousness.
When Sibelius said of his fourth sym-
, phony that it was “a protest against the
compositions of today”, with “nothing,
absolutely nothing of the circus about
it,” he was probably thinking of Strauss
rather than Ravel. But Ravel’s “Daphnis
f and Chloe”, written but not performed
when Sibelius’s fourth appeared in 1911,
might have qualified for his anathema.
Ravel’s sensuous theatricality could hard-
ly be in greater contrast to the still
austerity that dominates the symphony.
1 There is no question as to which com-
<position has won the popularity stakes:
| the “Daphnis” music, or the second suite
Trom it, must be one of the most fre-
| quently played and recorded of all 20th-
I century orchestral works.
\ In this new disc by Szell and the Cle-
| veland Orchestra it is paired with a work
; of the same period that must come close
j to equalling it in frequency of record-
i ing: Debussy’s “La Mer”. Those who still
recordings of these Impressionist
/masterpieces will find here performances
that place the emphasis on brilliance,
verve and clarity rather than richness:
ideal for Ravel, but a little less so for
Debussy. A fine disc, nevertheless.
S j Though Messiaen is now a sort of liv-
ing patron saint of the avant-garde there
■ is nothing very terrifying about the
“Three Little Liturgies of the Divine
Presence” (a typical Messiaenic title).
They were written in 1944, in the tran-
! sition period between his conventional
; early works and his experimental recent
ones, and in them the conventional and
the experimental are rather uncomfort-
ably patched together. The prevailing tex-
ture consists of simple, diatonic and
rather sentimental - sounding choral
phrases constantly repeated against vague
, arabesques of piano and percussion. The
effect is aurally sweet enough but — to
me, at least — amorphous and monoton-
ous, even under the persuasive Bern-
stein.
As a relief from the static contempla-
tions of Messiaen, the other side of the
disc carries the robustly athletic third
symphony of Roussel, a work admirably
suited to Bernstein’s dynamism.

Song of a Jew
Memory of blood-years
And condescending quiet
After the moon fell
On threads of a psalm.
From a chosen book
Strange words
Whispered in the silk-shawl-room
Weeping, thanking a distant God
For our suffering.
WENDY HOROWITZ
Winter and Grass
Little scribbles of grass,
Little knitted knots of herbage,
Little rusty fans and bunches,
Minute drops on miniature leaflets,
Glistening close to the earth.
Between these crimped and matted patches,
A froth of early clover,
A plume of slender lemon shoots,
A brittle white summer husk, swaying.
TIM BASS
Omega
The birds of prey that also sing
Stoop down so quick, from heat or shade,
They praise the flesh that feels their sting,
Raise bodies the world’s made, unmade.
Whatever traveller in the wind
Feels that thunder-clapping shadow
Tremble the mazes of his mind
Trembles with what the angels know,
Steps, then, in the spirit’s fire;
And what he aches for sings within
The perfect tone of his desire:
The days of Omega begin.
These are the cries that open hell,
Circles, geometries of sound
Raise up bodies that may fill
This holy and imperfect ground.
VINCENT BUCKLEY
Market Day
Market, or pitched battle, or Galway Hunt?
The dunged boots and sweaty heads
Following where the money leads;
Their women craning a goose’s neck
To see (to see is their great bargain);
The black humps of their cattle speak
More eloquently for them than words, or hands.
A settled people, whose good eye
Is closed to all but lechery,
Who spare neither the great nor young,
Who hate what the body understands,
Whose food is grass, whose wealth is dung.
Therefore, as in a painter’s heavy line,
I feel the scene as it was once:
The men quarrelsome in bronze,
The thieves bustling and sweating there,
The driven beasts, the dull horsemen,
Contemptuous of the living air.
VINCENT BUCKLEY
Aaron's Rod
Aaron unties the sack
fastened at the neck
with cord and spills a snake
on the ground at Pharaoh’s feet.
In the sack supine and slack;
on the ground turns back to strike,
lunges at Aaron’s heel.
Aaron rolls his sleeve
and deftly steps aside,
takes it by the tail,
lifts it from the ground,
the snake become a staff
stiff, helpless, rigid;
the shame of its underside
pale and barred with line
like the neck of a mandolin.
Opens the sack again
and thrusts the snake within.
Thus snake becomes a rod
and back again to snake
all for the glory of God.

At Blaze-of-Noon
I lay down in the wild grain
Watching the thin ears tossing
And tall sunbeams walking,
Felt in my flesh the sturdy
Force of the young shoots,
Cried for the joy of it
At the slice of the moon there
High in a world of blue
And knew how the noonday
World rustled and spoke
A burning language
Stronger than words or music
Body close to the earth
And the heart beating in time
With life, slow and steady
Stronger than with the pulse
Of earthly cities
And the thrust of engines
Rose, walking down
Brushed by the blazing stooks
To an ashen beach
Where icy toppling waves
Moved with that rhythm too
Hurling down pride and passion
Stilling the cries and murmurs
Of the day’s unrest
Stilling the blood’s torment
Teaching and reaching in
To the timid darting soul
Which only they can heal.

Iris Murdoch’s Gothic Orgy
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Italian Girl. Iris Murdoch. Chatto and
( Windus. 265. 6d.
Tdmirers of Iris Murdoch who viewed
nth some misgivings her excursion into
Gothic romance in “The Unicorn” might
have been able to comfort themselves
/by supposing her to be temporarily on
holiday. Those outlandish monsters
parading as characters, the garish,
creaky plot, the philosophical bumble-
dom all these pointed to a novelist
taking time off to peer into the cob-
webby corners of fictional history, per-
haps in search of a new shape for her
ideas. But indulgent anxiety turns to
disappointment and alarm at her latest
/work “The Italian Girl”; indeed were
'it not for the unblinking solemnity of
the whole performance one might be
inclined to write it off as a literary joke,
a parody of the “novel of ideas”.
Consider the cast. There is the
.narrator Edmund, a wood - engraver
|“The art of the wood-engraver may be
[deep but it is narrow”), who, consider-
ing his age and apparent experience, is
(innocent to the point of stupidity, and
■who is currently suffering from sexual
(Starvation (“It was years since I had
jseen a woman’s breasts”). There is his
jbrother Otto, a shambling dirty giant of
a man. He is a stone-mason, who spends
l ,a good deal of time in the novel not
[getting on with the cheerful task of
'making his mother’s tombstone. There is
Otto’s wife Isabel (who spends all her
time in her bedroom) and their daughter
Flora (moderately normal, but brittle).
There are the Levkins, David and Elsa,
bother and sister and of Russian birth.
And there is the Italian girl, Maggie the
,iaid, evidently as full of the warm
south as is Edmund of the cold north,
though she disguises the fact admirably.
The antics of this queer little cast
provide the action of the novel. Elsa
s Levkin, a prostitute and a crazed witch-
vlike creature, is Otto’s mistress; they run
a filthy establishment in the summer-
house. The chapter describing it is
headed “The Magic Brothel” magic
because with Elsa Otto has “a really
complete absolutely perfect physical
gelation”. “So”, says Otto, “everything I
am or do is beautiful.” Nevertheless, he
goes to bed drunk with his boots on,
and drops the empty Scotch bottle by the
side of the bed. David Levkin has two
mistresses, Otto’s wife and daughter. At
the beginning of the novel Flora goes off
I to have an abortion (David’s); and at the
end Isabel announces her pregnancy
(David’s). Edmund, after confusing
Maggie throughout the novel with all the
other Italian maids his mother has had,
discovers that she is Maggie and human
and he is in love; he carries her off to
Italy to marry her. David returns to
Russia; Isabel goes back to father in
Scotland to have David’s baby; Elsa is
incinerated when Isabel’s room catches
on fire—thus dying, as she had lived, a
witch. And Flora (purified by suffering)
stays home to look after Otto (also puri-
fied —and made simple—by suffering).
Incidental beauties grace this “bald
and unconvincing narrative”. Isabel tries
to seduce Edmund while he is taking the
tacking out of the hem of her dress.
David and Edmund chase each other
round Flora’s room because David sees
Edmund make a pass at her. (This
chapter is called “A Sexual Ballet”; it
opens with Edmund’s memorable words,
“Now with one hand I controlled my
heart which was striking
my side like a desperate
animal.”) Flora cuts off
Maggie’s bun with a pair of
kitchen scissors. (This is
particularly significant.) Ed-
mund chases Flora into a
wood and ends up carrying
Maggie out of it. (She,
cunning wench, pretends to
have lost her shoes. Only
Edmund is deceived.) But
my favorite scene occurs in
“The Magic Brothel” chap-
ter, where Edmund, dis-
turbed by a strange wailing
under his window in the middle of the
night, goes outside to find Elsa, who
has come to see the worms dance on the
lawn.
By courtesy of Miss Murdoch, we
see them, too, “translucent, their tails
in their holes”. Surely she is having us
on. I wish I thought she were; but I’m
afraid she’s not. It’s impossible not to
laugh at “The Italian Girl”; but perhaps
it would be more appropriate to weep for
its author. For it represents a sad
decline from her earlier work, which
showed not only an awareness of moral
issues, but an acute insight into the
nature of moral distinctions, and as
ability to translate these distinctions into
terms of believable characters.
In this novel moral observations are
offered in tabloid form. Otto is “broken
and made simple by a knowledge of
mortality”; Edmund is “suddenly able to
see the world and to love it”; he is re-
leased from the prison of self; but worst
of all, David pulls out with the air of
a sage a statement which has been
bandied about by moral philosophers
until it is threadbare. “It is better to do
the wrong thing for the right reasons
than the right thing for the wrong
reasons.” After this, one expects him to
announce that the subject of next week’s
tutorial will be the categorical imperative.
These thematic, ethical statements are
no more than slogans; they are meaning-
less since they are not acted out in terms
of character and situation, but merely
pasted on to give an appearance of
subtlety to a narrative which, for all its
eccentricities, is very plain indeed. Miss
Murdoch offers us not characters, but
a collection of freaks, and fabricates for
them a series of melodramatic, spurious
crises.
“Fabricated” is the word which best
describes “The Italian Girl”. The regu-
larity of its form is matched by the
mediocrity of its content. And its
staginess is nowhere better illustrated
than in the character of the narrator
Edmund. Granted he is meant to be
ineffectual, Puritanical, a would -be
savior in need of salvation (see Graham
Greene, Patrick White, Saul Bellow,
Randolph Stow, etc.). But Miss Murdoch
also makes him stupid—so
stupid that he squeaks with
astonishment at events
which the unfortunate
reader has seen coming for
pages. This is a technical
miscalculation utterly de-
structive to the narrative;
it also exposes the falseness
of the book. For what Miss
Murdoch has failed to say
through character, she tries
to pump in by way of atmo-
sphere. There are allusions
to Sibelius, Wagner, Ler-
montov, the Bible, witches
and fairies; there is heavily significant
symbolism; there is talk of bewitchment
and enchantment. But this is mere intel-
lectual trickery; all the finery conceals a
set of tailor’s dummies. So the verdict,
it seems to me, is not that this novel is
a brave failure, but that it is merely a
depressing one —depressing because the
author’s intelligence is not turned to-
wards character, but is busily occupied
in a treasure-hunt for the latest gim-
micks. And it is gloomy to record that
where, from Miss Murdoch, one might
have expected to gain a living sense of
human motives, one gets instead false
excitements, the hollow speech of hollow
men, and the tawdry atmospherics of a
synthetic world.
Two recent books on the Australian econ-
omy are discussed in the section
"Economics Anonymous" on page 59 of
this issue.


Lyndon Johnson in Australia
The Mission. Martin Caidin and Edward
Hymoff. Lippincott. 535. 6d.
If Lyndon Johnson had not become
President of the United States, it is
doubtful if the events of “The Mission”
would ever have been reported, at least
in this popular manner. It is entirely
possible that the book’s publication was
timed to coincide with Johnson's presi-
dential campaign. A new and favorable
image of him is certainly presented here.
The book left me with the feeling that
its authors, both of whom are experi-
enced writer on aeronautics, had blown
up to book-size material which was
sufficient only for an article. This is not
to suggest that “The Mission” itself was
unimportant; indeed, it may well have
had considerable influence on the out-
come of the war in the South-West
Pacific.
Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Lyndon
Johnson, then a congressman represent-
ing Texas and a Lieutenant-Commander
in the Naval Reserve, requested leave of
absence to take an active part in the
hostilities. During the early phase of the
Pacific War, President Roosevelt and
the American public had been receiving
conflicting and falsely optimistic reports
and it was obvious that an honest, im-
partial appraisal was needed. Johnson
was considered *:he ideal man for the job.
On his way to Australia, he met
Colonels Anderson and Stevens who, it
turned out, were engaged in an identical
mission for the War Department and
they agreed to work as a team. In Mel-
bourne, they conferred with General
MacArthur (whose unpopularity is hinted
at repeatedly) and surveyed the centre
American soldiers were being
trained by Australians, “rough, hardened
and no-nonsense combat veterans”, a
description which differed slightly from
that of MacArthur’s chief of staff (Suther-
land) who called them “undisciplined,
untrained, over-advertised and generally
useless . . .”
The Australian Government is taken
to task on its prejudicial attitude to-
wards American Negro troops. At a
time when invasion was threatened, the
Government requested their exclusion
from the country, a fact which was
effectively concealed from the Australian
public, who exhibited no hostility to-
wards the Negroes. Australian wharfies
are criticised for “serious interference
with American attempts to aid Aus-
tralia” by refusing to yield any of their
contract rights when supplies were des-
perately needed in the forward areas.
In Townsville, where the 22nd Bomb
Group was stationed, Johnson found
conditions appalling: severe deficiency
of equipment and supplies, 50 per cent
of the planes out of commission, and
communications poor. Johnson, Ander-
son and Stevens, determined to ex-
perience combat conditions, insisted on
participating in a bomber mission over
Lae on June 9, 1942. The raid and
ensuing air battle are described (in their
own words) by the pilots, various crew
members, and even Japanese ace Saburo
Sakai, all, oddly enough, in an identical,
literate, but slangy style. The crew of
the Marauder from which Johnson was
observing are unanimous about the cool
demeanor of the “long, skinny boy from
Texas” when failure of a generator whilst
under attack from a swarm of Japanese
Zeros very nearly finished them. Stevens
was killed in the one 826 lost on the
mission.
During the return trip to America,
Johnson became seriously ill, and it was
some weeks before he was able to report
his findings to President Roosevelt. He
spoke bluntly in the House and warned
Congress that, despite all that was being
shouted about “smashing victories of our
forces”, it was still possible for the
United States to lose the war. He lashed
out at the ineffectiveness of certain high-
ranking officers and emphasised the need
for the speedy provision of equipment
and leadership.
A wealth of documentary detail and
many photographs heighten the interest,
but, to my mind, the authors reduce the
value of the book by occasional and
quite unnecessary adoption of the
method of the übiquitous novelist to tell
their story, even to the extent of fictional
re-creation of the thoughts and actions
of enemy pilots.
TOM PICKERING
Genuflections Before “Voss”
A Map of Morning. Peter Hooper. Pegasus
Press 12s. 6d.
Enter Without Knocking: Selected Poems.
Denis Glover. The Pegasus Press. 17s. 6d.
Peter Plooper’s “A Map of Morning”
makes pleasant enough reading, but the
author too often seems content to record
his own pleasures rather than to re-create
them: to annotate rather than to make
and shape.
At his best, he has written several firm,
observant lyrics, disciplined as in “From
a Vineyard in Provence” or exploratory
as in “By a Willow Stream”, a piece of
anthropomorphic landscape about flood-
plains where “the current of being turns
upon itself”.
Denis Glover’s “Enter Without Knock-
ing” shows evidence of a consistent
wryness of personality and a consistently
developed manner. Except for a dash of
Auden in the thirties which resulted in
some elision of definite articles and a
few attempts at social diagnosis, he
impresses as a poet who found his voice
early and has stuck to it: stuck to it,
indeed, when a more adventurous spirit
might have driven him on to something
new much of his later poetry is a ,
little too predictably deadpan, too coni
fidently anti-romantic.
The dust-jacket points out that Glover
is making a separate collection of his!
“light verse and satires”. The contents'!
of “Enter Without Knocking” are, how-
ever, most properly to be described asi
light verse, whether raucously funny,,
as in “Solitary Drinker”, sadly ironic, as
in “To a Good. Ghost”, or simply imper-l
sonal, as in that favorite anthology/
piece, “The Magpies”.
Never again are the rhythms as assertiv
as this, but a spirit of compassion and,
complaint keeps forcing itself through
the genial detachment of Glover’s word
play. Where a real balance is strucl
between this quality of feeling and the
prevailing professionalism, as in the
“Sings Harry” sequence, the poems are
crisp and memorable (“But praise St
Francis feeding crumbs. Into the empty*
mouths of guns.”) But with “Arawata
Bill”, a later sequence, one is conscious
that the air of rustic simplicity is mere
device; nor are there rhythmical or per-
ceptual consolations for this artificiality,

Inside New Guinea ;
Stone Age Island. Maslyn Williams,/
fcollins. 455.
This is one of the best of recent books
about New 'Guinea (it was published
earlier this year) though whether it isi
one of the most discerning is another?
matter. The writer has the photographic!
eye of the film-maker; he has
extensively over New Guine-a, though
sometimes very far and very fast. He
can write capably which most people
who essay works on outlandish places
can’t. -
He is. short on past history and the,
knowledge of the mainsprings of de-f
velopment, and obviously endeavors to
present all sides and viewpoints as they
appear to him to exist; this impartially,;
if through eyes trained to see in a very!
modern setting of welfare-stateism andi
reaction against race division.
The New Guinea (and Papua) whicfy
he pictures has progressed very far from
the rough and ready, dangerous, malaria-
ridden New Guinea of the days ever
directly after World War I; from the
days of a Rabaul in which Ah Chee!*
Ching Hing and Ah Koon were kings o
commerce and no gold had been dis
covered inland from Salamaua, anf
there were no “highlands”, no aircrafi
none of the hundred leading names ot

towards civilisation were in train then,
though the fact is little acknowledged
today. It is easy to look back to the
German time and laugh at missions
called The Sacred Heart of Jesus, Ltd;
but the practical missions, both Protestant
and Catholic, of those days wefe sig-
nificant enterprises in civilisation and
>the artisan training programmes of great
centres like Alexishafen, did a wonder-
ful prototype job, and provided an
immense amount of basic knowledge for
those who came afterwards in the task
of making New Guinea self-reliant and
self-dependent.
The trouble with books like Mr
Williams’ is that their authors can present
conditions only as they themselves come
into contact with them, and see them.
And nobody ever stays long enough in
one place these days to get an intensive
grasp of the inner mainsprings of a
human situation. Of course, there are
the district officers who are always
optimists and irradiated by pride in
their districts. If they weren’t, they
would be no good. And there are the
academic scientists who can size up
everything and who take their haloes
earned as the black man’s only friend
with them when they go north and
regard the white planter, miner and de-
veloper as exploiters of a helpless people
as mentally good as they are if not
better, through being purer of heart and
mind. There are the Communists and
the Indonesian subverters. and there are
the colored do-gooders of the United
Nations. Most are eager to see New
Guinea’s disparate and bewildered Babel
of tribes, and varying stages of intel-
ligence and sophistication and outlook
“free” of all control, save that of the
tamies of interferers and busybodies who
spend fruitful lives showing other people
how to live, and cast off the yoke of the
oppressor and the exploiter.
It perhaps could be said, with truth,
(hat any old-time plantation owner re-
cruiting from all round the Territory
year after year knows more about the
average and collective capacities of the
various races of New Guinea and Papua
to live their own lives and look after
themselves in the modern world, than
half the civil service and academic re-
formers put together,
f Several factors entei into the opera-
tions of the free welfare state advocates:
they are urging the native to achieve
something he has never asked for and
probably won’t be able to manage for
two or three generations. They are
tempting him toward the goal by hold-
ing in front of his nose the bait of
material wealth which they reprobate
in the wicked colonialist planters W'ho
brought civilisation and the possibility
of organised general employment to the
inhabitants. They push the native to-
wards independence (under their own
benign tutelage, of course), but they are
careful not to mention self-dependence
which is the birthright of sovereign
peoples. They rarely have a word to say
about the lavish cost of government and
development that now falls on the
shoulders of Australian taxpayers.
And thus when it is sought to bring
home to the native that progress to-
wards total freedom means progress to-
wards freedom to pay for government
and become a totally taxed people, he
throws stones at the police. That even
in New Ireland, where the prospective
taxpayers wear flowers in their hair and
are the mildest of men.
About Mr Williams’ picture of man,
nature, viewpoint and the welfare state
and progress in New Guinea, it can be
said that it is comprehensively interest-
ing, and the very best tree of its kind
in the recently-grown forest of New
Guinea literature. Only one little warn-
ing about it is needed: things are not
always what they seem to even the most
skilled reporter, who is apt to regard
everything and everybody he meets as
a reasonably fair sampling. In respect
of the capacity of the average native
New Guinean to live a free life and to
govern himself, there are some cracks
in Mr Williams’ presentation. The reader
is apt to deduce from his pictures of
heirs of the headhunters who have be-
come parliamentarians in one generation,
that they represent at least a consider-
able aggregation of natives who could
do likewise. There are some who have
their doubts. And in one particular case
of a man of great ability who is cited,
the author fails to remark that his subject
appears to have a long and distinguished
river of historic European blood noted
for its virility, flowing into his pre-
sumedly indigenous New Guinea veins.

A Bawdy Bard
Nothing Like The Sun. Anthony Burgess.
Heinemann. 265. 6d.
Man Without a Shadow. Colin Wilson.
Arthur Barker. 265. 6d.
Anthony Burgess has found an unusual
way of celebrating the quatercentenary
year by writing a novel subtitled “A
Story of Shakespeare’s Love-life” to
show that Will’s sexual experiences were
the main influence on his life and work.
It is all told as lusty fiction with
enormous gusto and a scholarly wink,
in a magnificently earthy, irreverent,
near-Elizabethan prose style against a
background redolent of 16th-century
England with its bear gardens, hang-
ings-and-quarterings, saffron and garlic,
spewings and retchings and overpower-
ing stench. This Will is no worshipful
sacred cow but a bawdy, drunken,
disease-prone fellow whose Muse appears
to him in ecstatic visions as a voluptuous
woman.
Although betrothed to Anne Whateley
he is soon forced by wrathful kinsmen
into a marriage with Anne Hathaway,
who remains such a perverse and in-
satiable partner that Will is glad to go
off and seek his fortune with the Queen’s
Players. Eventually, he arrives in Lon-
don and the world of Marlowe, Greene
and Burbage. He combines a homo-
sexual relationship with his patron, the
young Earl of Southampton, with taking
bribes to write sonnets advising him to
marry and so reproduce himself.
Returning unexpectedly to Stratford,
Will surprises his wife and his own
brother together in the second-best bed,
which explains the nice irony of the
famous bequest. The shock drives him
back to London and a frenzy of writing,
and he borrows from Southampton, to
achieve the status of shareholder in the
new playhouse. But Lucy has passed On
“the modern disease” from which Will
suffers many years of torment and
eventual death, and which ‘sis
to account for the change from Sweet
Will into sour old Bard, and for his
later Muse developing a warped nature
and his pen and his plays growing
sharper.

all the year round
thou art, remain!” He joins a magician,
Carodoc Cunningham, in experiments
involving white, black or maybe just
plain grey magic (there is too much
smoke to tell), culminating in a cere-
monial enactment of “sex-magic”; after
which a woman is rushed off to hospital
and Cunningham has to leave the
country in a hurry.
Whichever way you look at it, the
story is still the Faust legend with the
magician a very recognisable Mephisto
to Sorme’s Faust, anu Diana a married
(in name only?) Marguerite whom Cun-
ningham entices away to Sorme. There
is also a side-long glance at Thomas
Mann’s Doctor Faustus through some ex-
cursions into musical aesthetics: Diana’s
first husband, Kirsten, is an elderly,
very undiscovered, composer who is in-
venting the Panharmonium, an electronic
organ, on which he plays excerpts from
his opera “Varney the Vampire” all
through the night.
Actually, Kirsten emerges as the
roundest figure in the book with his re-
actionary musical judgments, detesting
Berg’s forty - year - old modern opera
“Wozzeck”, calling Stravinsky “a musical
whore” and Pfitzner’s “Palestrina” the
“greatest and most sublime opera of the
twentieth century”. Here Wilson succeeds
in capturing the essence of the stunted
growth of all those expatriates who
think music stopped on the day they left
Vienna.
Preface I is a thesis on the history of
the novel from Homer to Colin Wilson’s
“existential realism”, wherein the author
explains why he has taken up Flaubert’s
abandoned diary-form: his aim is a book
of ideas without a story, which he had
not been able to achieve in his earlier
“Ritual in the Dark”. A conscientious
critic must point out that “Man Without
a Shadow” also has detectable signs of
a story, even one with a happy end. The
wife who is thanked for typing the
diaries is surely Diana, now made an
honest woman of! And struggling author
Sorme has become famous. But does that
really matter? It would be a pity if the
writing talent that can’t help showing
through is channelled into the wrong
direction.

A World of Marshes
The Marsh Arabs. Wilfred Thesiger. Long-
mans. 44s. 9d.
“The Marsh Arabs” is not a travelogue,
but a story lived by its author during
eight years of travelling among the
obscure tribes in an area visited by few
other outsiders, and subsequently closed
to visitors by political upheavals in
Iraq.
The publication of “Arabian Sands”
led inevitably to Thesiger’s being grouped
with other “British-Arabs” who had
made the area their own — Lawrence,
Sir John Glubb, Sir Richard Burton and
Harry St J. B. Philby; Glubb Pasha him-
self, reviewing “Arabian Sands” in the
London “Sunday Times”, called Thesiger
. . perhaps the last, and certainly one
of the greatest, of the British travellers
among the Arabs , . To place Thesiger
in this company is not unreasonable, for
he is of the mould which at the height
of Empire threw up the occasional
dedicated nonconformist who could
adapt himself to a land and culture alien
to his background and become part of it.
In Thesiger’s case the motive is not as
clear as in some others; there can be
no question of military or personal glory,
ego-building, evangelism, or the accrual
of wealth. His travels were not under-
taken as an anthropologist or as a pro-
fessional writer, his books being written
some years after his journeys took place
and then only at the persistent urging
of friends.
Thesiger himself gives us only the one
indication, that he “loathed cars, aero-
planes, wireless, television, in fact most
of our civilisation’s manifestations »
the past fifty years” and we must accept
at face value his own explanation that
he lived in the Marshes simply becau'sj
he liked being there, preferring to
a smoke-filled hovel with a shephercj
his family and beasts” to everything
civilisation had to offer. In the unique
way of life of the marshmen, cut 0$
from and little affected by the world out
side, “there was no sign of that dral
modernity which, in its uniform a
second - hand European clothes, wL
spreading like a blight across the re
of Iraq”.
The Marshes, around the junction
the Tigris and Euphrates in lower Ir$

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Less Inflationary than Feared
Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, gave fair warning
2 I of possible tax increases next year when he an-
nounced a new £ 1220 m. three-year defence pro-
gramme. The strain on manpower and resources will be

penditures on equipment and national training camps will

Authorised by the July, 1963, defence review is not so
stteep if related to the provision of an extra £llBm. for
ojlefence in the August, 1964, Budget, since it means that
the extra commitment now gets down to the need to find
in additional £2l2m. over three years, or an average of
si7om. a year. It still means, though, that Australia must
tdpnd a total of £4oom. a year for the next three years. It

offsets must be considered, however, which require a
deduction in capital works for States and the Common-

¥At this point, Australia’s overseas reserves are healthy
%ough to stand the equipment purchases envisaged by the
’'tew defence programme, but sustained exports and
Renewed borrowing must be undertaken to cushion the extra
‘frain on reserves.
Contracts for camp sites can be let to private con-
tactors, both in Australia and New Guinea, thus keeping
Js much money as possible circulating in the private sector.
t With co-operation all round, the obligation can be shoul-
dered, but the Treasury has a duty to see that the defence
money is spent wisely and not blindly.
The money can be found. Most people will bear the
burden willingly if they know the Government is doing
its best to apportion the load equitably.
Another Needle Required
"E'conomic experts in the US are predicting that a further
tax cut will be made by June, 1965, to keep the US
economy jogging along. Without such a stimulus the
analysts are expecting an economic downturn. Reduction in
sales tax has already been promised.
Construction spending was down in September, but other
economic statistics continue to show a healthy trend,
including a rise in personal incomes and an increase in
steel output. The effect of recent wage increases will not
be translated for some months, yet it is obvious there are
headaches ahead for the recently elected Johnson Admini-
stration.
With four years of government ahead of him, President
Johnson, holding a tremendous majority, now can decide
on implementing any unpopular measures designed to keep
inflation in check. His programme will not be presented
to Congress until next January and, in the light of further
agitation for tax cuts, some question mark must be set
against the continuance of a huge defence and space
programme.
The balance of payments situation is not all that good
and any crisis with sterling will help to aggravate the
situation. Unless the Johnson Administration is prepared
to go along with inflation in the next year or two, some
restraint seems inevitable.
Wilson Woos Again
ThiE UK Government appears to be indulging in some
window dressing when it talks of rapid growth in the
sterling area, aided by better commodity prices. This is
only one of several placatory statements to be issued as
the Wilson Labor Government stalls on its controversial
proposals on steel and land nationalisation while it
implements an emergency national Budget.
The UK Labor Government’s slender majority has en-
couraged Prime Minister Wilson and his Cabinet to adopt
a less drastic attitude than that which they proposed during
the election campaign. It is now being said in London
that the Labor Party’s social welfare and tax reform pro-
gramme is designed to appeal to the working population
with the object of staging a snap election in a few months,
with the hope of strengthening the current five-seat majority
in Parliament.
Cynics claim that the tricky steel nationalisation measure
has been put to the bottom of the agenda, while the
Government prepares to introduce the capital gains tax,
rent stabilisation and general increase in social welfare. —
all clearly designed to increase Mr Wilson’s popularity.

seats under his control, Mr Wilson may find himself out
in the cold again if he attempts to rush measures which
could cause some disruption among employees. None of
this alters the deteriorating financial position of sterling.
It is possible that the main crisis yet may be the ability
of the British Government to solve its balance of payments
troubles.
Purchasers of ships from overseas shipyards are stunned
that they have to pay a 15 p.c. imports surcharge. There
is general uneasiness among importers that the “temporary”
surcharge is only a stop-gap until complex imports control
machinery can be organised. Overseas exporters with a
big stake in the British market are said to have offered
to bear the burden of the 15 p.c. tax if it is a temporary
measure extending over a few months. Now they are not
so sure.
Protective Marriage
HTo combat the growing strength of the US auto giants
in Europe, Volkswagen has bought a 50 p.c. control
of Auto Union, West Germany. The deal cost an estimated
£lO million and links VW with one of its largest com-
petitors, namely Daimler-Benz, which owns the rest of the
capital in Auto Union.
VW and Daimler-Benz now own a tremendous market
in Europe. The merger is seen as a defensive move by
Daimler-Benz to gain a greater share of the cheaper car
market. Conversely, VW now moves into the expensive
range of European cars, thus making the group a
formidable opponent indeed.
Any Spare Copper Mines?
ITennecott Copper Corporation of the USA, which
produces about 121 p.c. of the Western world’s
copper, has signified its intention of seeking mineral
deposits in Australia. The president, Mr F. R. Milliken,
has spelled out very carefully that his company is not
interested in taking over any existing mining enterprises.
Logically enough, Kennecott seems to be adopting the
long-term attitude of trying to develop new mineral re-
sources, with profit motive a secondary consideration at
this stage. With a mind to recent pronouncements by the
Australian Government on the
need for joint participation,
Kennecott says it wants to en-
courage participation by exist-
ing Australian companies or
individual local investors in
the development of any
mineral deposits discovered
by Kennecott.
At the same time, Kenne-
cott is not averse to taking an
interest in a mineral venture
if increased capital investment
is needed. Although very big
as a miner of gold, silver and
molybdenite in the US, Ken-
necott seems to favor copper
in its mining activities abroad
and owns the world’s largest
underground copper mine in
Chile.
Small mining operators in
Australia, therefore, would
need to consider the large-
scale and specialist needs of a
giant like Kennecott before
raising their hopes of enticing

The graph above shows the 1963 passenger capacity (seat

But the door is open.
Coal versus Oil Again
HPhe Joint Coal Board’s report for 1963-64 appeared rigj c
on top of the Federal Government’s decision | £
request the Tariff Board to investigate “the broad issues (
involved in the marketing of Australian crude oil”.
Such an inquiry could, but at present most improbable*
blossom into the foundation of a fully-fledged
fuel policy, which would make the Coal Board and man;*
others very happy. At the least, though, the inquiry ii a
widely expected to conduct a searching examination d
the whole pattern of Australian oil refinery output.
That puts it squarely on the Coal Board’s thornie^ 1
domesic battlefield the selling struggle with petroleun'
products and especially heavy furnace oils. If anything*
the latest report sounds more forcible and disturbed thai*
earlier outbursts concerning this hardy annual.
The Board freely recognises the sheer trends of techno*
logical change, accepting “as inevitable the loss of |
market to another form of energy when this follows techno]
logical development bringing with it some particula|
advantage.” The worry comes when the petroleum industry
markets where “oil has no intrinsic advantage over coal,”
indulging in an alleged orgy of differential price-cutting.
Coal’s complaints go even further in suggesting that,
prices of automotive and aviation spirit, turbine jet fuel,]
road and railway diesel fuels have been inflated “to allow l
furnace oil to be sold at abnormally low prices.” Refineries!
are producing furnace oil disproportionately to their lighter
petroleum derivatives, leading to glut and depriving coal)
“of the reasonable access it should have to some markets,
in which oil has no intrinsic advantage over coal.”
After backing these assertions with an array of staffs-
tics, the Coal Board concludes
that “there is no need for
wasteful competition between
two such vital sources of
energy as coal and oil. It is of-
the highest importance that thej
role of each, together with the'
roles of all other present and!
prospective sources of energy, 1
be reviewed.”
Perhaps the Tariff Board’s 1 '
findings will go part of the l
way towards that eventual de-f
sirability. Speaking to The
Bulletin last week. Sip,
Edward Warren, chairman of;
the Australian Coal Associa-Vj
tion, reinforced the need for «' |
fuel policy by linking it tc
coal’s increasingly successfu j
export situation. “If the Coni’
monwealth Government come! <
into exports, it should have an i
energy policl as far as ths 1
home market is concerned,” he«
maintained. s


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
A Readable Economics Textbook
Women in Australian economic literature
is always the hope that some
[C j Australian economist will soon take
pie off to write a comprehensive treatise
Jn the working of the economy from
Ais own pen. Meanwhile we have to be
with what can be called joint
’ efforts by a number of them, whose main
interest seemingly lies in bed-
ding down in print with their fellows
, between stiff covers, content to leave the
glories of the dust cover to the head
and to settle for a minor
of authorship inside.
Even somebody with the standing of
Sir Douglas Copland, who has been
; walking the cloisters of Australian uni-
versities at various times over the last
half century or more, hasn’t stopped
jjlong enough to write a decent length
treatise on Australian economics. Like
jjiis successors, he is too fond of the
issay. When he accumulates enough of
jjhese he lumps them in with a few
Speeches, gets them bound together and
yie result is called a book.
>1 True, the small half loaves, or even
mns, from some of these people are
fetter than nothing, and this way of
offering economic writings to the public
|s to be excused on that account. The
trouble is that these are pretty well all
are getting from economists here.
[||an Shannon, who writes more on inter-
national economic themes, is a notable
'rcception. It’s hard to think of many
- ihers in recent years.
5 >The latest books from various pub-
r khers coming to my desk are all com-
n {osite works. They include one in which
[ I real effort has been made by several
f, (ueensland and National University
iionomists (Helen Hughes, Marian
; Gough, B. J. McFarlane and G. R.
j Calmer) to weld together a text book
they call “Queensland Industrial Enigma”
Melbourne University Press, 505.). This
Jjets nearer to a smooth writing synthesis
.(than another recent arrival with the un-
Vluly modest title “Economics: An Aus-
, Italian Introduction” (F. W. Cheshire).
' the latter goes under the joint editor-
ship of J. Me B. Grant and A. J. Hagger,
Aho together with G. G. Firth, A. Hock-
sng and A. W. Vout provide the contri-
butions.
Ane of the intriguing things about the
authorship of these two volumes is
that, like “The Structure of the Austral-
ian Economy” by P. H. Karmel and
Maureen Brunt, two Adelaide University
economists, the writers are all from the
smaller universities where, presumably,
the demands of teaching are less cramp-
ing to the economists there than those
in NSW and Victoria, where the heavy
pressures on the staffs leave little time
for creative thinking, let alone writing.
Also, the welcome appearance of women
among the contributors to some of these
recent books on economic subjects may
suggest they have more time on their
hands for such writing.
Women had a bigger fist in writing
“Queensland: Industrial Enigma” than in
the other book. It is to their favor that
it is much more evenly written. Also, as
the first critical appraisal of the pro-
spects for industrial development in
Queensland based on an empirical
SIR DOUGLAS COPLAND
survey of manufacturing industries, it
demands a full review on its own, a
matter which will be attended to in due
course. It stands up on its own as a
piece of objective and searching economic
writing. So does the Grant/Hagger book,
which, if it suffers from having involved
rather too many cooks and often swings
without warning from simple text book
stuff to highly sophisticated argument
and solid doses of algebra, will satisfy
most tasters of the Australian economic
setting and lead them on to a fuller
meal.
It is just possible, though, that an
ingenue in economics will find he is
biting off more than he can chew if he
dives straight into this so-called intro-
duction to Australian economics. In
places he will soon be struggling to get
through the argument and, if success-
ful in the early chapters, may well come
to a full stop when trying to tackle the
chapters towards the end. These have
obviously been written by A. J. Hagger,
a mathematical economist, who as editor
has probably calculated that by that
stage of the book the reader will have
had all the preliminary indoctrination
needed into the basic mysteries of the
science to undertake a battle course in
economic equations. If so, he has
seriously miscalculated.
Mo doubt it looks good to splash equa-
tions over any book on economics.
But few people remember the algebra
they learned at school, and few mathe-
maticians would be likely to read an in-
troduction to economics. The pity is that
the equations are not necessary to follow
the argument, so it must be presumed
they are simply there for show. They
spoil the pitch for ordinary batsmen,
supposedly the ones the book hopes to
reach.
The same can be said for the other
book’s use of “coefficients” in explain-
ing various ratios concerning the per-
formance of industry in Queensland. If
economists want their books to be read
and understood by ordinary people, in-
cluding politicians, they had best keep
to plain English. In all other respects
the Grant/Hagger work is an excellent
introduction to Australian economics. It
has you asking for more (useful refer-
ences for further reading are given at
the end of each chapter), and it doesn’t
beat about the bush.
The writers get into the subject with
barely a nod in the direction of the old
cliches which their forebears used so
tiresomely without helping an entry into
economics very much. None the less, it
is satisfactory to see Marshall's basic
definition of economics still in vogue
after seventy years or more. It was
thought up on a walking tour in the
Alps, so the legend has it. (Incidentally,
Marshall thought economics lended itself
well to mathematical expression but that
mathematics was not essential to the
subject.)
The acid test of this book is whether,
after going from cover to cover, the
reader will come out ready to climb to
the higher flights of economic reasoning
with a clear idea of the whole landscape.
To this end he would be well advised to
browse through the pages and attempt
to see how the four parts of the book
integrate. There is plenty to keep him
interested doing this. In fact one of


features of the book is that it reads very
freshly in terms of the current economic
scene where it dwells on the past this
is only to give the uninitiated a bridge
across to the present.
In this browsing process it would be
better to skip Part Two, which deals with
the problems of price fixing and the
economics of the individual firm, and
come back to it later. The other three
parts are easier to understand as they
are framed against the background of
familiar economic institutions. Indeed,
it is remarkable how the authors have
followed up their descriptive and
analytical treatment of the various facets
of the economy (including its inter-
national trade and payments) and found
themselves discussing live issues. That is
good, because it keeps the reader in-
terested when a less alive treatment could
easily bore him.
Torpedoes from the Treasuries
Australian misconceptions, British opportunism
rpoRPEDOEs came thick and fast from
Treasuries at either end of the Anglo-
Australian axis last week. We have our
healthy balance of payments position to
thank that our own Treasury’s target
was no more serious than to clear the
air of misconceptions about growth
rates and their measurement by GNP.
In its turn, Britain had mainly a yawn-
ing balance of payments deficit, coupled
with Socialist ideas on the allocation of
economic resources, to blame for a
Budget which raised a variety of tax
rates, including income tax and petrol,
following austerity measures surcharg-
ing most manufactured and semi-manu-
factured imports by 15 p.c. and turn-
ing the screw on private investment,
notably building.
The Federal Treasury has long been
distinctly unhappy at wide public mis-
conceptions about the whys and where-
fores of growth and in particular the
bandying about of the notion that the
bald figures for gross national product
tell everything. A supplement on the
subject in the latest Treasury Informa-
tion Bulletin now puts the matter in
admirable perspective. The only com-
plaint about it is that it requires rather
too much understanding of economics
for the general public to understand.
What is needed now is a popular exposi-
tion along the lines of similar effusions
which used to come for public instruc-
tion from the UK Treasury. Such a
follow-up could show, not so much the
Treasury thinking aloud, as it has in its
long paper, but a concise resume of the
main conclusions drawn from its think-
ing.
This time last year we were jibing at
politicians on the hustings for their wild
use of GNP in projecting their ambitious
growth targets. We suggested, among
other things, that some of them were
trying to blind the electorate with their
own limited understanding of economic
science and measurement to the neglect
of the Commonwealth Statistician’s own
apologia on the subject. All this quite
apart from any emphasis which might be
put on social investment and welfare,
in preference to economic growth, as
measured by national output on the
Statistician’s strict criteria.
The Treasury document should make
them warier in the current Senate elec-
tion campaign. Not only is the measure
of GNP revealed as an imperfect one
for economic growth itself. The paper
also suggests that social investment and
welfare, whose measurement lies outside
JAMES CALLAGHAN
the statistical conception of GNP, are
sometimes of overriding significance in
national objectives. If there can be any
doubt about the latter, Mr Harold Wil-
son’s clear-cut drive to sacrifice some-
thing of economic growth to make way
for more social investment and heighten-
ing social welfare should allay it. He is
being as opportunist as Mr Attlee in using
a balance-of-payments crisis to divert in-
vestment resources towards these ends.
As the Treasury paper states, “A
nation’s growth is not to be evaluated
merely by the growth in output per headpj
or even by the growth in total product
tion.” And further, “If it were thoughtf]
desirable, instead, to increase the pro^ (
portion of national expenditure devoted,#
to education, health and the like or toU
travel or the patronage of the arts, the*
statistical growth of productivity (in
strict economic sense) would be veryj
much lower even though, in the view of \
many, the quality of life might thereby!
be improved. Pursuing the latter course!
could in that event look like allowing the/;
economy to stagnate and of failing t|
keep up with other countries in the com, r(
parative tables of international
growth rates.” £
This recognition from the Treasury
that economic growth is not everything,
is refreshing, even if cynics may say D 1
that this and several other reasons
in the paper why our economic growth
rate is not as spectacular as in somq,
other countries are merely excuses for,
failing to get a higher growth rate. t |
variety of reasons is given, including
some of the Treasury’s long-recognised
hobby horses, such as excessive protec-] (
tion. Restrictive trade practices are also el
mentioned, and institutional factors. Fori
instance “restrictions on output per]
worker, so-called ‘demarcation disputes’!
between different trades, restrictions on
entry to skilled trades and so on, can
slow down the growth of output.”
The paper says nothing very new when „
talking about the effects of Government
policy on economic growth. It declares ,
that the Government’s chief aim is to
maintain a favorable environment fori
growth, in particular by “encouraging the |
maintenance of a steady but not excessive!
expansion of demand”. It postulates aj,
changing pattern of demand with a con- s
sequential changing pattern of output, 5
which it essays to maximise within the
limits dictated by resources. “If the aim
is to be the maximum output that best,
meets the demands of the community!
(and here the needs of the future will'
be relevant) the most effective practical
course would appear to be that of pro-i
moting conditions favorable to the maxi-j
misation of that output, whatever the re-4
sultant growth rate as measured by GNP,
at constant prices proves to be”. It stops,
short of saying what the actual courses]
to be followed would be in particular;
circumstances.
Still speaking generally, it says that, bye
the use of general monetary policies and
in more specific ways, the Government)
seeks to ensure that demand will contl
tinue to grow at a rate appropriate t(b
absorb the growth in the work-forcC
and to take account of the steady imo
provement in techniques and hence proc
ductivity per worker that is proceeding-1'
at a rate, in other words, that will en'i
sure full employment within an improvf

The Lure of Screen and Sound
Television and radio makers still confident
The booming home - entertainment
industry, after a shot in the arm
in 1956-57 when television broad-
casting started in Australia, is due for
another injection shortly when the re-
placement market for television receivers
begins to grow. Replacements in radios
and radiograms are perhaps not as im-
portant, though manufacturers do expect
the growth rate to continue in these
sectors of production.
Production of television receivers in
Australia reached its zenith in 1959-60
when 435,500 were produced. Since
then there has been a gradual downturn.
The table below illustrates the pattern
of production for both radio and tele-
vision receivers.

As it is now eight years since Aus-
tralia’s first television receivers were
manufactured, and the estimated life
(before replacement, not breakdown) of
a good quality set is eight years, it is no
wonder the industry is looking forward
to big things.
While the pattern of production of
television receivers has changed, so has
the manufacturers’ own picture. During
the peak production years there were
some 24 firms manufacturing sets in
Australia. Now there are only fourteen.
Of that fourteen, a mere handful have
the lion's share of the market.
However, because the industry over-
estimated the future market (the
maximum output in the next ten years,
says one manufacturer, will probably not
exceed 320,000 sets a year), the industry
suffers from a large amount of over-
capacity, probably more so than most
industries producing consumer durables.
One executive estimated the industry was
capable, without too much trouble and
a minimal amount of overtime, of pro-
ducing from 400,000 to 500,000 sets a
year, “but only 270,000 units are being
turned out at present”. Fortunately, in
some cases, this excess capacity can be
directed to production of other items.
Only some, not all, however.
With radios the picture is slightly
different. Here again there is a degree
of excess capacity, though it is not as
large as in television. A wider variety
of models helps, too.
Chairman of EMI (Australia) Ltd,
John M. Burnett, said the replacement
market for television receivers was
stronger in NSW and Victoria than any-
where else in Australia. “They have
had television for longer than other
States and it will be here that the full
strength of the replacement market will
first be felt.
“And it will probably be stronger in
Melbourne than in Sydney. Melbourne
had the Olympic Games in 1956 and a
large number of 17-inch sets were pur-
chased. They are being replaced now.
It will probably be another year or so
before the industry gets the full benei
of replacement of the 21-inch sets.” I
“When television first came to Auj
tralia it adversely affected the production
of radios. The upswing in productic
has been helped greatly by the advent <|
the transistor portable. A few years a«
most families had only one radio. No
the three radio family is commonplaci
The buying power of the teenager fa
helped make this possible.
“About 60 p.c. of radio purchase
are made by, for, or at the behest /
teenage girls. The portable recc/
player, too, will become a big seller.”
A spokesman for AWA said new tel;
vision stations opening up,
in country areas, would help teievisi?,
receiver sales.
“There are three factors which an
going to help sell television sets. Firs
there are new areas. Secondly thei
is the replacement market, which 1
going to be quite substantial. Son:
17, 21 and 23-inch sets are being tradd
in already on newer and bigger self
Thirdly there is going to be a big interes
in small (about 11 inch screen) light
weight models for use as a second set
“Now that production has been mori
or less stabilised and overseas manu
facturers have left the scene, the peoplj
who were big in electronics before telei
vision will be the ones who will benefij
from these three factors. We should seJ
1966 as the best year for replacement
sales eight years after the boom yeal
for television.”
Biggest headache for the radio in
dustry is the Japanese product. Sait
AWA: “Japanese transistor radios entei
the country in three ways smuggled,
imported and as personal effects. Somu
relief has been given to the Australian
industry by limiting the number that cat!
be brought into the country personally!
duty free, to one. But they are still irfa
ported legally, and illegally.
“The only real solution to smuggling
is to make our detection system so strong
and the penalties so high that thai
smuggler cannot win. However, here,:
again we have a problem. Once tha
radios are detected they are seized and]
eventually publicly auctioned, so theyf
find their way into the market in the
long run. For this reason the penalties
must be so harsh that the radios nevei
leave Japan.
“The total number of foreign radios:
entering the country would be in
region of 350,000 to 400,000 a year. If
there were no imports the industry could
probably sell about half that number or
top of present sales. It would probabl;
not go much higher than that becaust
of the lower price of the Japanesf
product.
“Radiogram production is on the un
swing as well. I think that television hat
starved people of music and they’U

changing to recorded music to satisfy
their hunger. This is evident, not only
from radiogram sales but also from
record sales, which are booming at
present. This boom will pass to portable
record players as well.”
An executive of Pye Industries said
an important factor in the replacement
of a television set was styling. “Often
you will find a television set traded in
because the owner is sick of the styling
or likes a new style. The set itself might
be in very good working order. With
the increasing amount of teak furniture
sold today the industry can expect a
strong market for teak television sets.”
Retailing of radio and television
receivers is just as competitive as the
washing machines and refrigerators men-
tioned in last week’s Bulletin. One
industry spokesman called the retail side
of the business “horse trading.” “They
leave no competitive stones unturned —
price deals, ridiculous trade-ins, adver-
tising, giveaways. You name it, they do
it.”
An Electronic Industries spokesman
forecast widespread use of transistors in
television. “Transistorisation of tele-
vision should gradually grow bigger. It
will be of little signficance until de-
veloped to the point where performance
can be improved, or costs reduced.
Whereas transistors permit a compact
radio set, a television tube prevents any
further compactness. So transistors lose
the main portion of their advantage.”
He predicts further developments in tele-
vision transistorisation in the next five
years “and in maybe even less time
nearly all radios will be transistors —75
p.c. are now. Their development has
been the main factor in lifting sales since
the introduction of television.
“Increased spending power of the
teenager, the radio stations, which
nearly all cater for the teenager, and
the success of pop music have helped lift
sales, too. Car radios are becoming
more popular and this year will be the
best ever.”
An executive of Philips Electrical In-
dustries Pty Ltd said that in the current
financial year about 25,000 television
sets would be scrapped., Next year the
figure might reach 47,000. “It is very
hard to prove that this number of sets
is scrapped,” he said, “because it is very
hard to tell what happens to the sets
traded in for replacement. Are they
scrapped or are they re-sold or are they
hired out?
“Some of them find their way back
into homes as second sets. The old 17-
inch models are very popular for this
purpose. In July, an estimated 3 p.c.
of homes in the Sydney metropolitan
area had two or more television sets.
And 90 p.c. of all Sydney metropolitan
homes have television. Other capital
cities are roughly comparable.”

MARKET POINTERS
Competition for Labor
Defence measures must worry industry
rpHE new defence measures, although
•*- inflationary in terms of Government
competition for labor and material re-
sources, involve a mainly psychological
reaction at this stage.
Government expenditures will not be
large until the 1965-66 financial year,
when further tax demands and credit
restraints must be considered.
Of immediate importance is the likely
effect of large purchases of equipment
from overseas, which will shrink Aus-
tralia’s overseas reserves unless bolstered
by exports and capital inflow.
On balance, the immediate worry to
industry is the increase in Government
competition for labor at a time when
wage costs are rising. Unless these costs
are passed on to the public, profit
margins will fall, particularly if new
taxes are envisaged next year.
Import competition, however, does not
permit manufacturers the luxury of in-
creasing local selling prices. So it will
be necessary to improve efficiency in
order to absorb the extra cost.
★ ★ ★
ThiosE who buy shares as a hedge
against inflation must temper their
decision with the realisation that earn-
ing rates may not be maintained at exist-
ing levels.
★ ★ ★
(Heneral reaction to defence plans is
that contractors should get extra
tvork in the building and construction
fields.
Unfortunately the history of recent
■tendering for public works and defence
contracts suggests that severe under-
cutting has caused losses. Some care
should be observed here.
★ ★ *
'Engineering firms could obtain defence
contracts which will help to boost
their turnover without necessarily in-
volving additional capital expenditure.
Firms which might benefit could be
AW A and Pye in the electronics field
and possible Clyde and Commonwealth
Engineering in the heavy engineering
business.
Increased spending in New Guinea
must rub off onto the island traders,
like Steamships Trading, W. R. Car-
penter and Burns, Philp. More import-
antly, any company which is registered
in Papua and paying only half as much
tax as an Australian company should
be in a strong position to take advantage
of new developments.
This thought might prompt a few new
flotations in the area.

Getting the Last Laugh
Repco’s bid for Automotive Components
Oepco's offer for Automotive Com-
r*' ponents will take a lot of sting out
bf the tumbling share prices which
/shareholders have seen recently.
In fact, it may even give them the last
laugh over the three directors who
managed to sell more than 40,000 shares
for an average price of about 9s. before
the company’s poor 1963-64 results were
released. True, the offer is worth only
about 7s. Bd. for each ACL ss. share.
But a shareholding in Repco will no
doubt increase rapidly in value over the
next few months.
In 1963-64 Repco’s profit jumped by
20 p.c. for the second time in succession.
Profit, at a record £2.1 million, equalled
a buoyant 26.8 p.c. on capital, and divi-
dend was held at 15 p.c. Shares issued
in the present takeover will rank for
dividends from January 1 next. More-
over, they will participate in a one-for-
jeight ss. premium issue to be made in
'that same month. Barring unforeseen
circumstances, the Repco group is in for
further expansion and new performance
records in 1964-65.
At the time of going to press, it seems
that the share and cash offer can only be
accepted. In the first place, it is more
than 2s. higher in value than the market
jprice for ACL shares before the an-
nouncement. Secondly, ACL on its lone-
fsome has a very doubtful future,
j especially now that three of its five
► directors have resigned following the
I publication of their share-selling activities
Und an investigation by the Attorney-
f General.
} As far as Repco is concerned, its
* activities in the motor industry will now
[have a wider base and a certain com-
petitive element has been eliminated. It
was only last March that Compcork was
taken over. It manufactures cork for
(gaskets, seals, etc. This, too, widened
;Repco’s base, a practice which is neces-
(sary if the directors’ policy of planned
expansion is to succeed.
'
Factors' Harvesting
4 t the annual meeting of Factors last
week, Mr Stanley Korrnan told
shareholders that a further £500,000 had
been paid off CAGA’s £l.B million loan,
reducing the debt to £900,000 now. This
confirms The Bulletin estimates on
October 17 (p. 66) that asset sales in
New Zealand, if applied to the loan,
would bring the debt to less than £1
million.
It also means further savings for the
group on the burdensome 11 p.c. interest
rate which is charged on the loan. Un-
doubtedly quick redaction is desirable,
but whether assets should be sold to this
end is a moot point. In Mr Korman’s own
words: “What is Factors going to do? At
the present time, it is taking in the har-
vest — realising assets in order to pay
back the loan.”
The trouble with this analogy is that
Factors has sold the NZ assets which pro-
duced the harvest, as well as the harvest
itself. So there will be no harvest in
future years. The question is, with assets
being realised, can the group earn enough
from Holeproof NZ alone to make profits

and pay back the loan and its interest at
the same time?
At present it would be unwise to draw
conclusions on the matter. On the sur-
face of things, the target is definitely
feasible. Although Mr Korman has not
bothered to give shareholders any detailed
plans or timetable as to repayment, his
references to the fact that the group is
now on profits and that dividends will be
resumed one day, combined with his past
troubles and the enquiries into Stanhill
by Mr Peter Murphy, QC, ensure that he
is not trying blatantly to pull the wool
over anyone’s eyes.
Nevertheless, shareholders would be
correct in asking for knowledge of any
further repayment plans, firstly in an at-
tempt to find justification for Mr Kor-
man’s extreme confidence and secondly
to have something tangible by which to
measure his future achievements. Un-
fortunately, among all the hubbub, bally-
hoo and emotional twaddle engulfing
question-time at the two-hour meeting,
no-one managed to discuss anything as
concrete as this.
Textile Troubles
fpHE writing’s been on the wall for Stir-
ling Henry for some time and now
it’s happened a thumping £329,240
loss, nearly five times as big as the pre-
vious year’s profit of £63,668. Since 1961
the continuing decrease in profits has
pushed the ss. shares down from Bs. 3d.
to 2s. 6d., where they stand at present.
Following the loss the company is
not paying a dividend. It is the first time
it has incurred a loss and not paid a
dividend since listing in 1937. There
is no tax provision (the loss could prove
a blessing in disguise if the company can
get back on its feet) but depreciation is
£4198 lower at £39,862.
In their advance statement directors
give no reason for the loss. The an-
nouncement followed a request from the
Stock Exchange for information.

sales. In 1963-64, profit slipped from
£l.B million to £1.4 million after a sales
rise from £44.7 million to £48.9 million.
Warnings cover for the lli p.c. dividend,
reduced trom 12i in 1962-63, was a
slim 11.8 p.c. Mr Sleigh said the lower
profit was basically due to the develop-
nent costs of new ventures which had
iaken longer than expected to reach
iirofits.
The trend in the first quarter of the
urrent year indicates that these ventures
.nay at last be making money, so, for
1964-65, earnings and dividends should
be maintained. The extent of any im-
provement will go a long way in deter-
mining whether 1965-66 will see further
setbacks and dividend cuts. In that
year, a note conversion will boost paid
capital from £11.3 million to £12.5
million. In 1968-69 another conversion
will boost the figure to £13.7 million,
providing no additions have come about
in the meantime.
Success depends almost entirely on
the group’s new ventures. Interest
charges are unlikely to ease (they rose
from £864,000 to £1,059,000 in 1963-
64). This year another £105,000 will be
jpayable on £H million notes placement
made a few months back. Any further
burden is very likely to counter-
act profits from the new ventures and
ieep earnings at the present depressed
'levels.

sion showed an increase in turnover

COMPANY ADVERTISEMENT
BROKEN HILL SOUTH LIMITED'S INCREASED PROFITS
CAME MAINLY FROM MINING OPERATIONS
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS STRESSES COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE INTERESTS
The 46th Annual General Meeting of Broken Hill South Limited was held in
Melbourne on the 2nd November, 1964. The Chairman of Directors, Mr. G.
Lindesay Clark, presented his review of the Company’s operations during the
year ended 30th June, 1964, including an announcement that the copper mine
at Cobar is expected to commence producing ore on schedule next July.
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW WERE:
Financial
Mr. Clark stated that the net profit of the
Company increased to £1,774,000, com-
pared with £943,000 for the previous year.
Working account surplus increased by
£1,318,000 to £2,057,000. The value of
ore production from the South Mine in-
creased by £1,808,000 due principally to
higher prices received for lead and zinc.^
The Profit and Loss account revealed in-
creased revenue from dividend and interest
amounting to £108,000. The change by
Metal Manufactures Ltd. in the closing date
of its accounting year, resulting in dividends
being received in respect of 17 months
operations, accounted for £102,000 of this
sum.
As a result of the substantial increase in
net revenue from the mine the provision for
N.S.W. Mining Royalty amounted to
£252,000 and for Commonwealth Income
Tax £363,000. .
There had been an increase in Stock-
holders’ Funds during the year of £2,364,000
arising mainly from calls and share pre-
miums on the Company s contributing
shares, and from funds generated and re-
tained within the business.
The book value of the Company’s invest-
ments in other companies increased by
£3,368,000. During the year the Company
subscribed for, and fully paid up, 1,931,086
shares of £1 each in Cobar Mines Pty. Ltd.
It also took and fully paid up a further
435,000 shares of £1 each in the Electro-
lytic Refining and Smelting Co. of Aus-
tralia Ltd. As a result the Company’s
interests in these subsidiary companies have
been maintained at 76-2/3% for Cobar
Mines, and 60% for E.R. & S.
Calls of 6/6 paid on the 3,663,889
contributing shares held in Alcoa required
£1,191,000, making these shares paid to
15/6 per share. Since the end of the finan-
cial year another 3/- per share had been
paid, making the Alcoa shares paid to 18/6
With the present available cash resources
and given a continuation of existing revenue
earning conditions the Company would be
able to meet from internal sources its com-
mitments to Cobar Mines and Alcoa in the
year ending 30th June, 1965.
Current market value of listed invest-
ments held at 28th October amounted to
£3,264,000 against the book figure of
£2,524,000.
Operations at Broken Hill
Referring to operations at Broken Hill,
Mr. Clark said that there was a 2%
rise in ore production to 300,500 tons but
the higher grade of ore mined brought
about a 9% increase in the output of metal
contained in concentrates. Working cost per
ton was £7/9/-, the same as the previous
year.
Ore reserves declined by 150,000 tons to
1,120,000 tons.
Production for the current year was
budgeted at 275,000 tons, having regard to
high metal prices and present ore reserves.
Exploratory development
Mr. Clark said that the haulage drive
completed last year, connecting No 7
shaft with Browne Shaft, had given access
to the Western Mineralisation at the 1480-
ft. level. Drilled grade was of the order of
3% lead, 1 oz. silver/ton and 4% zinc, and
the estimated mining grade would be some-
what less than this figure.
Under normal industrial conditions at
Broken Hill this grade was of marginal
economic value, and negotiations for special
conditions in this area had been initiated
with the labour unions.
Broken Hill district
Active exploration throughout the Broken
Hill district was continuing in association
with North Broken Hill Limited and
Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd.
with the aid of geophysics, geochemistry
and diamond drilling.
Exploration in other areas
Work had been continued with North, E.Z.
and McPhar Geophysics Limited of Canada,
in other areas.
At Kanmantoo, some 30 miles south-east
of Adelaide, diamond drilling of the near
surface copper lode, discovered last year,
had progressed at a high rate. To date,
approximately 28,000 feet of diamond drill-
ing and 20,000 feet of percussion drilling
in shallow vertical holes from the surface
had been completed. The deposits occur
in the tightly-folded portion of a sedi-
mentary bed.
Drilling had not disclosed sufficient con-
tinuity of values to permit open-cut mining
as ha,d been initially hoped. It was intended
to drill a deeper series of holes to see
whether sufficient ore could be found to
justify an underground operation.
The Company had commenced prospect-
ing the old Mt. Bischoff- mine and sur-
rounding territory in Tasmania for tin in
association with Mount Costigan Mines
Ltd., of Canada.
An interest had been acquired by the
Company in a joint venture with Lime and
Marble Ltd. of New Zealand to explore an
asbestos deposit in New Zealand.
The Cobar field
Mr. Clark stated that the date for pro-
duction from copper orebodies at Cobar
had been originally set for July, 1965, and
it appeared this objective was likely to be
achieved. Bringing Cobar into production
would maintain South’s major interest in
mining, and with the increasing industriali-
sation taking place throughout the world,
and consequent demand for copper, should
ensure satisfactory returns continuing far
into the future.
Mr. Clark emphasised that the Cobar
field is an extensive mineral district, some
11 miles in length, and that the ore-
bodies on which diamond drilling has been
carried out are the two C.S.A. orebodies
and the Chesney orebody. The drilling pro-
gramme indicated some eighteen million
tons of ore within the area drilled on these
orebodies, the average value as drilled being
3.54% copper over 31.5 feet with ore con-
tinuing in depth, the deeper holes giving
overall the best results.
It was decided, therefore, to open up
initially the two C.S.A. orebodies to pro-
duce copper at the rate of approximately
20,000 tons per annum, which seemed well
within the capacity of the field to sustain
once the mines had been equipped.
Of the two C.S.A. orebodies, the Eastern
orebody on the 1200-ft. level had been
driven and pattern drilled for a length of
550 feet; the average grade was 2.3% cop-
per for an average width of 33 feet. The
full length of the shoot appears to have ;
been disclosed at this horizon. The drive
on the Western orebody at the 1200-ft. level
was still in progress. The length of the ore
exposed to date was 1120 feet with an
average grade of 2.4% of copper over an
average width of 26 feet. These two ore-


bodies are parallel and some 600 feet
apart and will be developed as one mining
operation.
In order to ensure profitable production
from the beginning the mining and milling
equipment has been so designed that output
can be adjusted to compensate for the lower
than average grade expected in the early
mining operations.
It was expected that ore will begin to
Imake in the Western orebody at C.S.A.
•some 500 to 600 feet and in the Eastern
some 800 to 900 feet below the surface. It
'was further expected that the grade and
size of the orebody will gradually increase
as progress in depth carries working
towards the centre of the oreshoot.
Development was in progress in the
C.S.A. mine from No. 1 shaft which had
been sunk to a depth of 1300 feet. The
No. 2 shaft had been sunk to 2000 feet and
the plat, loading station and development
for production on the 1800-ft. level were
now well advanced.
Last year Mr. Clark described generally
the method of mining with the highly
mechanised equipment which has since been
installed.
In both orebodies ground conditions dis-
closed ore well suited to mechanised mining
practices which will ensure a profitable cost
level at the grade of ore expected.
Due to delays in shaft sinking and the
conversion of the shaft for level develop-
ment, it was now expected development on
the 1800-ft. level will reach the lodes in
about three months’ time. Production will
begin from ore above the 1200-ft. level and
will begin on the 1800-ft. level when de-
velopment is sufficiently advanced. It was
expected that the whole of this vertical
extent will be accessible for stopping by
early 1966. Equipment was arriving on
schedule and the mill and all other con-
struction were well advanced.
Mr. Clark said that extensive metallur-
gical investigations had been completed in
the pilot plant from which it was esti-
mated that average recoveries of 93%
copper will be achieved in the mill with a
! concentrate grade of approximately 23%
copper. The concentrate will be sent by
rail to Port Kembla for treatment by The
Electrolytic Refining & Smelting Co. of
Australia Ltd.
Work had commenced on all contracts
associated with the Cobar Water Supply
Scheme, and this project was scheduled for
completion by July, 1965. Recent intakes
into the local water storage had improved
the supply position, and no delay to the
C.S.A. programme was expected, although
care is being exercised in the use of the
available water. Mr. Clark acknowledged
the contribution of the New South Wales
Government and the co-operation of the
Departmental officials in the provision
of the essential services at Cobar of water
supply, electric power and rail transport.
South’s other interests
Mr. Clark then reviewed the progress
of South's other interests when he said
that profits earned by The Electrolytic
Refining & Smelting Co. of Australia Ltd.
showed a significant improvement as com-
pared with the previous year.
The E. R. & S. Company was engaged in
preparing for the smelting and refining of
Cobar copper concentrates, including a new
blast furnace and a new tankhouse which
Would cost approximately £1.750,000, and
this would be financed by E.R. & S. partly
from internal funds.
With the acquisition of the contract to
treat Cobar concentrates, its facilities would
all be brought into active operation, and in
due course the Company should be able to
make a contribution to South’s revenue
commensurate with its investment,
Alcoa of Australia
Alcoa of Australia had continued the de-
velopment of its integrated operation in
1964 as the company’s volume of business
steadily increased, keeping pace with the
growing demand for aluminium.
Some £30 million had been spent on in-
stallation of facilities to date. The difficulties
in bringing such an array of facilities into
smooth operation were very considerable
and this must be taken into account in
assessing early results. The published loss
in 1963 reflected these difficulties and the
limited production to that date. For 1964
it was expected that losses would continue,
but with the rapid expansion of production
this phase was passing.
Overall, Broken Hill South Directors
were confident of the future growth of
Alcoa of Australia into one of the most
important Australian industries, from which
South in the not too distant future will
draw substantial contributions to its revenue.
Beach Petroleum
Referring to South’s allotment of 1,750,000
shares in Beach Petroleum N.L. paid to 2/-
per share upon payment of 1/- per share,
Mr. Clark said that the intention was that
the remaining 3/- per share would be called
by Beach Petroleum over the ensuing five
years, Broken Hill South’s total obligation
being £262,000.
With North Broken Hill Limited’s interest
of 3,250,000 shares, the combined interests
of the North and South Companies was
50%.
The Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd,
Production levels achieved at B.H.A.S. dur-
ing the year were at near-plant capacity
with lead and acid production of 223,990
tons and 68,076 tons respectively. The pro-
duction of acid was a record for the plant.
The recovery of zinc from the slag re-
sulting from lead smelting operations at Pt.
Pirie is under investigation. The slag con-
tains large quantities of zinc and some lead,
and its treatment should provide, in due
course, a substantial addition to the return
from B.H.A.S.
Metal sales and trends
The demand for lead was extremely buoy-
ant both in the domestic and overseas
markets throughout the year and sales by
B.H.A.S. totalled 225,000 tons compared
with 215,000 tons for the previous year.
Zinc consumption is at a high level and
exceeds present mine production. Additional
mine capacity is becoming available, and
may be expected to increase. Nevertheless
the position of the zinc market is unlikely
to be greatly weakened, unless there is a
severe recession in the world automobile
industry.
With the increased demand for zinc the
relations between the mining and treatment
companies have gradually changed through-
out the world to the advantage of the
mining companies. In consequence of this
and the higher zinc price, the importance
of zinc production from the mine has
greatly increased.
1817
Last week it was revealed that 1963-64
profits jumped from £198,000 to
£346,000. Earning rate has almost
doubled from 9.3 p.c. to 18.2 p.c. How-
ever, ordinary dividend has merely been
lifted from an already low 5 p.c. to a
not much better li p.c.
In addition, it seems that profits may
be rather conservatively stated. Tax
provision is £311,000.
The profit is the best since 1955-56.
Since then, two downturns have
occurred—in 1956-57 and 1957-58 when
profits barely covered preference divi-
dends, and in 1960-61 when the credit
squeeze took a severe toll. Although
low, the dividend is the highest since
the 10 p.c. distributed in 1954-55 and
1955-56.
Nevertheless, the latest payout is ex-
tremely poor in relation to profits. The
fact that the British parent (it owns 52
p.c. of the local company) has big
development plans both in the UK and
overseas adds further to new issue
thoughts. In the next 18 months, it is
known that the parent intends to raise
£stgls million to finance these plans.
Rootes (Aust.) must surely participate.
Recovery Road
Tt now seems definite that the Mel-
bourne-based manufacturer of trans-
port trailers, buses and forklift trucks,
Freighters Ltd, will be resuming dividend
payments in the current year. The com-
pany’s last payout was 10 p.c. in 1960-61.
At the annual meeting last week, chair-
man K. O Humphreys said pre-tax pro-
fits would be around £250,000 in 1964-65
and a final payout was most likely.
On past history, his predictions can be
relied on. After losses in 1961-62 and
1962- a Court case over inflated stock
values and a board reorganisation last
year, he predicted that pre-tax profits in
1963- would be about £150,000. They
were £157,000, so he actually underesti-
mated. The result, after tax of £23,000,
equalled 8.9 p.c. on paid ordinary capital.
What this year’s earning rate will come
out at is difficult to predict. Most cer-
tainly it will be more than 10 p.c. How
much it beats this mark by will depend
largely on the tax payout. This will be
much heavier than £23,000 but nowhere
near what it would be under normal
circumstances. A spokesman for the com-
pany told The Bulletin that past losses
would lighten the tax bill in 1965-66 as
well as in the current year.
It would be unwise to expect a return
to the 10 p.c. rate of 1961, although
such a possibility is not entirely remote.
The 1961 payout was covered by earnings
of only 12.3 p.c., a figure which could
well be reached this year.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Security with Growth
Wilke and Co.'s inherent solidarity
.rpHE ss. shares of Wilke and Co. Ltd
do not seem to deserve any great
consideration just now, except from a
very long-term point of view. At around
155., they yield a meagre 3.3 p.c. after
brokerage. This is hardly what one
would call attractive, especially as capi-
tal gain prospects appear to be rather
minute, following statements made by
the chairman in his annual review of
the group's operations.
Mr R. J. McArthur said that, in re-
cent years, it had become more apparent
that a larger proportion of permanent
requirements should be financed on a
long-term basis. Accordingly, £600,000
in loan capital has been raised since
balance date, June 30. The MLC
organisation has parted with £300,000 in
return for a 7 p.c. 25-year first mortgage
over Wilke’s £459,000 worth of freehold
properties (balance sheet value). The
mther £300,000 was raised through insti-
tutional placements of 10-year 7i p.c. un-
secured notes. Maturity date is Aug-
ust 31, 1974. As the MLC is probably
involved in this too, a further note of
solidarity has been introduced.
The effects of these moves, and they
are by no means small, on the accom-
panying table, will be discussed a little
later. In the meantime, it suffices to
[emphasise that shareholders are feeling
/somewhat neglected and, again, that cur-
rent prices seem too high for anything
but a very long-term proposition. The
table shows that the shares touched a
peak in September last year, when an
> issue was expected in many quarters.
However, all that arose was a share
’ split, from 20s. to ss. par.
The last issue was a 35-for-100 at
par in, 1954-55. Prior to this there was
a one-for-four at par in 1951-52 and a
one-for-one bonus in 1950-51 from an
,asset revaluation.
On present indications, it would be
unwise to expect anything more in the
next few years than the regular 10 p.c.
dividends which have prevailed since
1960. Although earnings are high
(23.6 p.c.), they may well see temporary
setbacks this year at least, when £lOB,OOO
of the ordinary capital ranks fully. Only
one-sixth of this ranked in 1963-64. In-
terest charges will obviously be higher
this year, too. The £lOB,OOO involves
capital issued to option holders. Earn-
ing rate would come back to 20 p.c. if
1963-64 profit for ordinary shares,
£131,000, was maintained this year.
Whether or not it will be seems dis-
putable. In his review, Mr McArthur
pointed out that a shortage of skilled per-
sonnel had made things difficult in 1963-
64, but efforts to increase productivity,
improve methods and minimise costs had
managed to bring about record results.
In discussing 1964-65, he said: “The
company is still experiencing an acute
shortage of skilled personnel, and, as a
consequence, substantial payments for
over-award rates and overtime premiums,
further increased by recent wage deci-
sions, are now significant factors in the
wages cost. These additional labor costs,
together with the high cost of raw mater-
ials brought about by the substantial tariff
protections for the local industry, will
continue to affect the company’s rewards
for capital and skills employed.”
Keeping up-to-date with the latest pro-
duction methods and technology is, of
course, imperative in this field. To this
end, an association with England’s Hazell
Sun organisation has proved a boon. The
UK group has now been taken over by
the British Printing Corporation Ltd.
Wilke’s association is to continue, how-
ever, and a liaison has been formed with
the new parent which should also bring
benefits.
But the main reason behind the price
level is the extremely steady nature of
the concern. This type of business, on
a big scale, is less likely to fluctuate than
almost any other Australian industry.
Wilke’s profit growth through the credit-
squeeze years illustrates this admirably.
If nothing else, the shares offer an in-
vestment which is virtually as safe as
money in the bank, as well as better
growth in the long-term to boot. Such
a proposition always brings market prices
which may appear a little high—a maxi-
mum of security and reasonable growth
is a rare combination. So, although
there is no case for paying much more
than 155., there is also little argument
for selling the price down below this
level—unless any shareholder has hopes
that are not long-term.
The accompanying table illustrates
Wilke’s inherent solidarity. Working
capital is low this year, but only be-
cause current liabilities include £250,000
in unsecured notes due on November 30.
The £600,000 raised since June 30 will
meet this and also be used to reduce
bank overdraft commitments which total
another £230,000 odd. So working capi-
tal will end up around normal levels
again, while loan capital will jump sub-
stantially. However, the jump is nothing
to worry over, because, first, the loans
are long-term and, second, because loan

ERNEST HILLER HLDGS LTD
An Efficiency Drive
Earnest Hiller Holdings Ltd, in a
strong drive for exports, has recent-
ty obtained good opening orders for
{lightweight suits from leading men’s
wear stores in the heart of London’s
-.West End, the centre of the British
fashion industry—a notable achievement
and one which opens extensive markets.
! However, the imposition of the tem-
porary tariff on manufactured goods by
;the new British Government put a
• damper on the news. The future success
■of the scheme must depend on negotia-
tions at a Government level. Hiller,
though, is not confining its activities to
the UK, but plans to step up a selling
drive on the Continent in the near
future, where it believes a sizeable market
exists.
J Ernest Hiller Apparel Pty Ltd, the
main operating subsidiary, began in 1947
making men’s sports coats and later
moved into the field of men’s suits. The
present holding company floated in 1957
with an issue of 200,000 ss. shares at
par and came on to the Stock Exchange
lists with a paid-up capital of £150,000.
Since then, shareholders have par-
ticipated in two cash issues, a one-for-
two in 1958 and the same again in
1960. In recent years, however, capital
increases have been from the issue of
shares to the company’s US associate,
Palm Beach Co., which holds options
to take up a 25 p.c. interest in the
company by July 1, 1965, Paid-up
capital at last balance date was
£393,425, with the Palm Beach com-
pany still holding an option over
226,300 shares,
Profit has risen strongly over the
past three years, although, due to the
share issues to Palm Beach, the rate of
earning to capital has not shown the
same improvement. The profit in 1960-
61 was adversely affected by the forced
clearance of stocks,
Result for the latest year was a record
£40,177, compared with £38,410 earn-
ed in the previous year. In 1960-61


BRAMBLES INDUSTRIES LIMITED
CORNER DACEY AVENUE AND DOWLING STREET, WATERLOO, N.S.W.
Chairman's Address
delivered at the 10th Annual General Meeting
Sydney: 30th October, 1964
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is again my privilege to address
you at this our Tenth Annual General
Meeting. In formally welcoming you to
this meeting—the first held in Sydney—
it is appropriate that I should comment
upon the decision to change the venue
for our meetings.
As many of our shareholders would
recall, Brambles was floated as a public
company in 1954 to conduct the carry-
ing business which was established by
the Bramble family in Newcastle before
the turn of the century. From 1954 and
for some years to follow, the capital
structure of the Company was a modest
one, and the shareholding was sub-
stantially held by people in the New-
castle area.
With the passage of time, the Com-
pany has grown both in size and
diversity, and whereas, in 1954, there
was but a handful of shareholders, to-
day we can feel very proud of the fact
that we have over eight thousand share-
holders and three thousand employees.
Of the shareholders in the Company,
by far the greatest number are domiciled
today in Sydney, although an examina-
tion of the share registers reveals just
how widely spread throughout all States
is the shareholding in Brambles.
The accounts for the year ended 30th
June, 1964, together with the reports of
the Directors and Auditors thereon, have
been in your hands for the past month,
and with your permission will be taken
as read. I now have pleasure in moving
the adoption of the Accounts and the
reports of the Directors and Auditors for
the year ended 30th June, 1964.
The year just concluded has been
a memorable one in Brambles’ ten-year
history as a public company. With a
record profit and a greatly improved
return on funds employed, your Direc-
tors’ confidence in the long-term benefits
of a major reorganisation initiated a
little more than two years ago has been
more than justified.
From an examination of the Accounts
for the year under review, it will be
apparent to all that your Company is in
a very sound position. Today, profits
derived from within our own trading
activities are entirely adequate to main-
tain the present dividend appropriation
without resort to income from invest-
ments in our three associated companies.
The achievements of the last two
years have been substantially effected
from within the Company’s own re-
sources. During this period, the total
complex of activities has been re-shaped
materially and, today, the present re-
sources of the Brambles Group are em-
ployed in the manner illustrated on page
three of the Annual Report for 1964.
The review of operations forming the
closing section of the Annual Report
reflects a representative range of the
services and other activities conducted
today by the Brambles Group of Com-
panies.
In pursuing a policy designed to give
depth and continuing purpose to the
Company’s main activities, your Direc-
tors now feel that the time is appropriate
to review its future funding arrange-
ments in order to provide assistance for
the long-term planning of your Com-
pany’s growth.
Mention has been made in the Direc-
tors’ Report that arrangements are well
advanced to place privately with in-
stitutions and others £l.O million of
debenture stock with currencies of ten
to twenty years. The need for the intro-
duction of long-term fixed interest
borrowings has been recognised for some
time as an essential ingredient to the
Company’s progress, once the problems
of reorganisation had been overcome.
The funds to be derived from the
debenture issue, the very substantial
internal generation from depreciation
and amortisation of fixed assets, and
continuance of a high level of retained
earnings, will be applied in a capital
expenditure programme during 1964/65,
designed principally to expand existing
activities within the Group.
The Brambles Companies play a vital
role in Australia’s development. First
and foremost Brambles is a service
organisation to a wide cross-section of
Australian industry. As industry con-
tinues to expand in our stable economy,
Brambles must keep pace with these
developments in extending its total range
of services. We share the views of lead-
ing industrialists that Australia’s con-
tinuing prosperity and, indeed, its future
lies in recognition of the need to discover
the latent wealth and resources of our
Commonwealth.
Pioneering of new industry calls for
great courage and insight on the part
of the private sector in the business com-
munity, for the road to profitable estab-
lishment is most times a long and
arduous one. The ultimate rewards for
adventure into new territories, new
products and new services require to be
balanced to the needs of yesterday’s
growth. In Brambles’ future planning,
your Directors are hopeful that the
Company can continue to step side by
side with Governments and the private
sector who have recognised the potential
and the need for development of our
less-industrialised States and Territories.
The extent to which new developments
can be pursued will be determined by
the amount of funds that can be set aside
or raised in each and every year for
this purpose. With the improved return
on shareholders’ funds during the past
year, your Directors do not foresee any
immediate difficulty in financing the
early years of certain new projects,
despite the continually higher drain off
of profits from both direct and indirect
taxation.
In looking ahead, your Directors have
decided to recommend that a bonus
issue be made out of share premium
reserve on the basis of one (1) new 57-
share for every three (3) stock units
held on 30th October, 1964. Should this
proposal be ratified by shareholders, and
given a continuance of present trading
conditions, your Directors anticipate
profits will be more than adequate to
enable the payment of future dividends
at the rate of 15% per annum on the
paid-up capital as increased by the
bonus issue.
In reflecting upon the progress of the
Company over the past six years, share-
holders’ funds have increased from £l.B
million to £6.0 million principally by a
number of share issues and retained
earnings.
Your Directors now feel that it is
opportune to propose an increase in the
authorised capital from £5.0 million to
£lO.O million to provide for possible
expansion in the next few years. The
Board at the present time does not
contemplate immediate further issues,
but, of course, trading profitability and
other opportunities could well change
present intentions on relatively short
notice.
The two proposals referred to above
are to be considered by shareholders at
the extraordinary general meeting to be
held at the conclusion of this meeting.
There is every prospect that 1964/65
will be another good year for Brambles,
provided that trading conditions through-
out the Commonwealth of Australia con-
tinue at present levels and are not
materially affected by those measures
brought down in the recent Federal
Budget. We are indeed grateful for the
support and interest shown by many of
the shareholders in using and recom-
mending our many services during the
past year.
I would like to conclude by expressing
the Directors’ appreciation of the loyalty
of the staff and the efforts which they
have made during a year which has been
unique in the Company’s history.
R. A. DICKSON.
Chairman.

earnings slumped from £36,398 to
I £14,930. Earning rate in the latest year
was unchanged at 10.2 p.c. on higher
capital. Tax provision was down from
£26,200 to £24,250 because of conces-
sions obtained in the drive for export
markets and investment allowance on
new plant and machinery.
After two years of 12i p.c. dividends
in 1959 and 1960, the payout was cut
to 7* p.c. the following year, after the
'slump in profit, and then to 6 p.c. in
1962. In both these years, earnings
.failed to cover the dividend payment
and reserves were drawn on to meet
the difference. In 1963, the payout was
lifted to a well covered 7i p.c. and last
year to 8 p.c.
The reserves position is sound,
although unspectacular. Subject to the
intangible item, net assets backing of
each ss. share is ss. 4d. on book values.
The current year has opened well
with orders ahead of those of the cor-
responding period of the previous year.
Following the production check during
1963-64, during the reorganisation, out-
|.put has now been restored to its pre-
vious levels. The export drive is also ex-
pected to bring in additional business.
; The shares are currently being sold
below par. As the men’s suit industry is
not affected to the same extent as the
women’s fashion industry by changes in
style, the market appears to be below
the shares’ true value.

Bad Debts and Poker Machines
Or shying away from retailers
HThere are a few addicts in the share
A game whom you’ll generally find
in the foyer of the Stock Exchange. Per-
haps there would be more if the Rev.
Gordon Powell could get the Govern-
ment to abolish poker machines.
In his sermon against this evil, he
stated that they encouraged people to
be dishonest and caused credit to be lost.
In fact, he said, “A director of Bucking-
hams Ltd, Mr H. Bate, gave me per-
mission to quote him as saying it was
the considered opinion of the company
that poker machines were the main cause
of bad debts.” Mr Bate should be well
qualified to pass criticism, as bad debts
in his company amounted to £500,000
this year.
It would be interesting to hear a
comment by Marcus Clark on this sub-
ject. Doubtful debts this year were a
very sizeable figure for them, yet did not
seem to cause undue worry. Directors
simply created a very large provision
for doubtful debts from a capital reserve.
This sort of thing frightens me off
investing in retailing. Instead, I decided
to look at one of the most cheaply priced
motor shares. Ira L. and A. C. Berk (or
Berk Ira as the Stock Exchange now calls
it) has had an eventful history. Formed
back in 1912, it first held the agency
for Packard cars. In 1938 it changed
over to the distribution of Hudson and
Renault. Twenty-five years later, again
it made another major distribution move
when it acquired the franchise for the
Nissan Datsun in Queensland and the
Ford dealership in Maroubra, Sydney.
Just prior to this, Ira Berk had been
tempted outside the car industry. Vend-
ing machines were all the rage when it
acquired a 54 p.c. interest in Automat
(A’asia) Holdings and a 51 pc. interest
in Mass Vending and Sales Pty Ltd. This
proved an excellent example of unwise
diversification. Nevertheless, the com-
pany seems to have extricated itself from
this field without too much damage.
Also affecting results for the last few
years was the relinquishment of the
Rootes franchise that it had acquired in
1958. Left high and dry without a motor
franchise in the city, the company was
forced to move out of its William Street
home. It is now established at Maroubra
Junction.
If this was all, the present market
price of 2s. lid. is a fair valuation of
the shares. But this company’s future
lies in the Nissan Datsun franchise held
in Queensland. The growth in Nissan
Datsun registrations reminds me of the
upward surge in Chrysler registrations
a few years back. Half-year breakdowns
for the Nissan Datsun registrations in
Queensland are as follows:
July/Dec., 1962 510
Jan./June, 1963 775
July/Dec., 1963 979
Jan./June, 1964 1,016
For the three months to September,
1964, registrations numbered 688, so the
upward trend is now more steep than
ever.
It seems fair to assume that the
Queensland subsidiary has carried the
southern operations for the last few
years. The Ford dealership in Maroubra
should be on at least a breakeven point
now. So with. Queensland sales booming,
a substantial increase in profits and divi-
dends seems likely this year. (A 51 p.c.
dividend was paid for the 1963/64 year.)
A purchase of 2000 shares was made at
2s. lid.
The other purchase this week was 400
King Island Scheelite at 12s. 6d. Ever
since the tungsten price started to rise
strongly, these shares have attracted me.
Sales this week were Associated Port-
land Cement, AOG and Plastic Holdings.
Everyone had nominated 14s. 6d. as the
price for Associated Portland, so an
opening market about that price was
only to be expected. In fact, this makes
them more than fully priced.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Associated Portland, 14/6 .. £283
200 AOG, 37/6 £370
1000 Plastic Holdings, 6/9 £328
BOUGHT

THE MAN ON THE LAND
American Textiles Revolution
What it means for Australian wool
Any doubts about the existence of a
United States plan to tie up the flow
of wool textiles throughout the world
has now been dispelled by news from
Japan. A Japanese wool textile industry
delegation is to go to Europe this month
to try to seek closer ties with European
manufacturers in opposing the US plan.
The delegation is to be led by Mr
Kyutaro Izaki, managing director of the
Japan Wool and Linen Exporters’ As-
sociation, and will include presidents of
the Japan Wool Spinners’ Association,
the Japan Wool Textile Weavers’ As-
sociation and the Japan Wool Textile
Importers’ Association. They will visit
,Britain, Italy and France the main
'European wool textile manufacturing
with Britain, of course, being
the largest.
In a statement from Tokyo the Japan
Wool and Linen Exporters’ Association
says that there are “strong indications”
that the United States will renew its
efforts to persuade the wool textile ex-
porting nations to accept the idea of an
linternational agreement on wool textiles
’trading. The US, according to this
Japanese source, is likely to make its
play at the December meeting of the
International Wool Study Group in
London.
. The Japan Wool and Linen Exporters’
Association says that Japanese in-.
| lustrialists and traders fear they could
, become “isolated internationally” unless
they redouble their endeavors to make
stronger ties with their European
counterparts and block the US proposal.
The implications of a US-inspired and
sponsored world Wool textiles tie-up
>,could well be grave indeed for the Aus-
tralian wool-growing industry. It appears
iigh time that some plain answers should
le demanded of the United States.
Following the cut-backs last year in
our meat exports to the US—definitely
more their way than ours —we should
need little reminder of the “double
standard” employed all too often by the
Onited States in trade. It is a case of
the old technique of “do what I say, not
what I do myself”. America preaches
the benefits of freeing trade and liberal-
ising tariffs in Geneva, but in Cedar
iKapids it’s good old USA first and the
Test a long way second.
The trouble is we do not know nearly
enough about this American-inspired
idea of a world wool textiles agreement.
The Japanese may not either, yet they
are getting in early, obviously, and are
determined to get to the bottom of it.
Officially, as far as the US Govern-
ment is concerned, the proposal does not
exist. Therefore it must be assumed that
it emanates from the US textiles in-
dustry.
A few weeks ago, when this writer first
mentioned the US textiles plan in rela-
tion to a possible Red Chinese upsurge
in textiles manufacturing, he remarked
that the US had no wool textiles industry
of its own, or none to speak of. This
requires some explanation. It is small —
though only in comparison with the rest
of the US industrial complex.
Because of the enormity of America’s
industrial might, the US textiles industry
would rank third behind Britain and
Japan if her mills utilised wool as fully
as they might. However, the US in-
dustry does not utilise nearly so much
wool as synthetic fibres (supplied by her
own manufacturers, such as du Pont)
even though she does have the capacity
to make use of wool.
This raises two possibilities. Either
the US textiles industry is alarmed at
the imports of manufactured woollen
goods from Japan, Britain and Italy and
wants to increase the locally-produced
share; or she wants to restrict the world
flow of wool textile goods so that her
own synthetic substitutes may begin an
export drive.
The first possibility would be better
for Australia than the second. Both
would have inherent difficulties for us.
If the US textiles industry is going
to increase its usage of wool, then it will
have to buy most of the apparel wool
required from Australia. The local US
woolgrowing industry is not really an
industry at all. It is based on itinerant
shepherding of sheep in the mountain
and desert regions during periods when
pasture is available.
If they want wool, the Americans will
have to buy most of it from Australia.
If they do this, we may lose our best
customer to date —Japan.
If, on the other hand, the idea behind
the US plan is to restrict wool textiles

Without any shadow of a doubt the

idustry. For years now the industry
,'as been regarded as being pretty sick.
Vi existed mainly in the form of small
factories throughout New England and
the southern States—small concerns with
out-dated machinery and dwindling labor
sources. All this is in the process of
change and the secret is automation.
Consolidation (mergers) of the 7000
mills (employing about 900,000 people)
is predicted by US economists.
for us, “steady growth” for
spun synthetics is also predicted.
Overall aim of the industry is to lift
the rate of return on assets —about 5.6
p.c. —up to at least the average for all
US manufacturing—lo.l p.c.
