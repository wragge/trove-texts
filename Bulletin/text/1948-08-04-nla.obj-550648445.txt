KNOLE HOUSE HAS A ROOM FOR EACH DAY IN THE YEAR
HISTORIC Knole House, near Scvenoaks, in Kent, is regarded
as an outstanding example of a great English baronial
mansion, and in the spring of 1947, by the generosity of the present
Lord Sackville, it was given to the British nation for permanent
preservation through the National Trust.
The great rambling house, standing in 900 acres of parkland,
covers an area of four acres, is covered by seven acres of roof,
contains 365 rooms, 52 staircases' and seven courtyards. The
handsome battlemented gatehouse supported by square corner
towers is Tudor work, and the long flanking wings with graceful
gables and regular groups of tall brick chimneys were added to the
house by the first Earl of Dorset at the beginning of the 17th
century. Knole was originally built in 1486 by Archbishop
Bourchier, and belonged to the Archbishops of Canterbury until
Cranmer resigned it to Henry VIII. It came into the Sackville
family in June, 1566, when Queen Elizabeth presented the house to
her relative, Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst.
The royalties and notabilities who have visited or lived in
Knole are too numerous to catalogue; the contacts between the
house and the great events of European history are of endless
variety and interest. In the bedroom, prepared at a cost of £20,000
for the reception of King James I, the visitor may see a tiny silver
eyebath provided for his use, dwarfed amid a Stuart toilet set of
solid silver. In the Venetian Ambassador’s bedroom, decorated by
Inigo Jones, there is still a sense of use in all the faded magnifi-
cence. In the spacious ballroom stands a Louis XIV clock, which
was presented to the third Duke of Dorset by Louis XVI, and
some of the Sevres china was the gift of Napoleon I. The
unparalleled wealth of furnishings throughout the house, the
embossed silver tables, the tapestries and textiles, the gorgeous suites
of furniture, the immense gallery of family portraits, each alone
is such as to make Knole unique as a repository of the arts of
the 17th century.
John Dryden, the poet, who was a visitor here, on one occasion
found a £lOO note under his plate. Horace Walpole stayed at
Knole, and both Reynolds and Gainsborough painted here.

CENSORSHIP PLAN.
In an endeavor to find out what useful
services, if any, are performed by the
Commonwealth Literature Censorship
Board The Bulletin wrote not long ago
to a member of the board ; who, to a
series of questions, replied discreetly:
Under the terms of my appointment as
a member of the board I am expressly
required by tire Minister not to discuss
any of its activities without his special
permission.
This was, of course, extremely proper ot
the member, and his reply was courteous.
Yet the incident is typical of that highly
undesirable secrecy in which all censor-
ship operations in Australia are con-
ducted. The members of the board are
Dr. L. H. Allen, M.A., Ph.D. (chairman),
Mr. J. F. M. Haydon, M.A., both of the
Canberra University College, and Mr.
Kenneth Binns,' formerly librarian of the
National Library. The Appeal Censor is
Sir Robert Garran, G.C.M.G., K.C.,
M.A., LL.D. Are gentlemen of such
learning and eminence not allowed to
talk ?
The Bulletin wrote again; this time
to Mr, J. J, Kennedy, the Comptroller
of Customs, whose department deals with
imported literature as with other mer-
chandise. Mr. Kennedy’s reply was
signed per someone or other —a faintly
alarming procedure —but it, too, was
courteous. The Bulletin’s questions and
the department’s replies were;
Question No. I. —Duties and powers of
the Literature Censorship Board and to
whom is it responsible?
Answer. —The duties of the Literature
Censorship Board are to advise the Minister
for Trade and Customs as to whether any
literature imported which may be referred
to it is, in the board’s cpinion, blas-
phemous, indecent or obscene within the
meaning of Section 52 (c) of the Customs
Act, 1901-47. The board is responsible
to the Minister for Trade and Customs.
Question No. 2. —Duties and powers of
the Literature Appeal Censor and to whom
is he responsible?
Answer. —Where the Literature Censor-
ship Board is of opinion that any litera-
ture is blasphemous, indecent or obscene,
the importer of such literature may apply
to have the literature submitted to the
Appeal Censor for review. The duties of
the Appeal Censor are to review any litera-
ture sq submitted and to determine whether,
in his opinion, the literature is indecent,
blasphemous or obscene. The Appeal
Censor is responsible to the Minister for
Trade and Customs.
Question No. 3. Does the Literature
Censorship Board issue any reports, and
are such reports available?
Answer. —The board does not issue re-
ports.
Question No. 4. —How many works of
literature have been submitted to the board
for review and their decisions?
Answer. —This information is not avail-
able, and, in any case, the opinions of the
board in respect of any literature submitted
to it are regarded as confidential.
Question No. 5. —Similar information in
regard to the Literature Appeal Censor?
Answer.— -See answer to Question No. 4
above.
Question No. 6. —ls a list of works
examined by (a) the board, and (6) the
Appeals Censor, available?
Answer. —No.
This letter, like the board member’s,
was well-meant but not exactly helpful.
Writers, artists, publishers, booksellers
and anybody interested in the freedom of
literature and the advance of culture in
Australia may leam what has been done
about censorship in a general way by
Act of Parliament and by Regulation ;
they may learn, as Mr. Kennedy stated in
another paragraph of his reply, who are
the members of the board ; but on the
vital matter of what, if anything, the
board has done, is doing and intends to
do, not a word of information is available.
If the suspicion arises that the board
has done precisely nothing the public
can hardly be blamed for it. Those whose
trade it is to import books say that the
clerks of the Customs Department are,
as of old, a law unto themselves; that,
when they are in a censoring mood, they
go through the list of titles of books arriv-
ing from overseas and seize upon those
that look “obscene” ; and that while these
learned clerks are making up their minds
as to whether or. not the seized books are
obscene, the importer waits . . . and
waits ... and waits. The Tasmanian
bookseller who imported a book with
some such title as My Garden of Delight
waited six months while the department
deliberated over this suspicious volume —
which turned out to be an innocent work
on gardening. What action, if any, the
Literature Censorship Board took in this
case will doubtless never be known.
It is not quite clear from the Customs
Regulation No. 72 of 1937, which brought
the Censorship Board into being, whether
or not the board has the power to advise
the Minister to release the prohibition on
books that have been banned in the past.
It is obviously necessary for the ban to
be lifted in many cases: Redheap, for
example. The board could at least, it
would seem, advise on the /natter were a
fresh attempt made to import a book
banned before it came into existence. But
once again, nobody can find out what the
board has done; what is its policy, if
any ; or what are the opinions of its in-
dividual members.
While this unnecessary and objection-
able secrecy prevails it hardly seems
worth while advocating that the board’s
“activities” should be extended, or that
a similar board should be set up to
advise or adjudicate in cases where a
book published in Australia is threatened
with censorship. Another board that will
do nothing, or act only in secrecy, would
be no use to authors threatened with jail
or heavy fines for the crime of writing a
book, or to publishers prevented by fines
and the risk of “contempt of Court” from
selling and distributing it.
Yet, if a new board were set up, its
operations need not be secret; the present
board may, after all, be doing good
service behind its “iron curtain”; and
while it is in existence the public has
at least the assurance that imported books
may be submitted to the inspection of
men of culture, intelligence and goodwill
towards literature. Assuming that cen-
sorship in some form or other will always
be considered necessary—the point is de-
batable —only a similar board can give
to Australian writers the protection which
any civilised Government should offer
against the assaults of the illiterate.
In the present muddled state of censor-
ship in Australia books are banned in
two ways. Imported books are dealt with
by our masters, the clerks of the Customs
Department, and it is for a defence
against this arbitrary and secret procedure
that the Federal Government of 1937 set
up the Literature Censorship Board.
Books published in Australia are dealt
with by prosecution under the laws of the
State in which they are published. These
books are not actually banned, but the
edition may be ordered to be confiscated,
and a publisher who reprinted a work that
had been the subject of a prosecution
would risk a repeated fine or an action
for contempt of Court. The system leads
to much absurdity and to intolerable in-
justices, and it is to remedy this situation
that it is suggested that either a new
board be set up or the powers of the
present board be extended.
By setting up the present board the
Commonwealth has already recognised,
in principle, the desirability of allowing
censorship to be administered by men
who know something about books. Given
the goodwill of the States, there is no
obstacle to the formation of a board to
deal with censorship questions relating to
books published in Australia. Under
Sub-section 37 of Clause 51 of the Federal
Constitution the Federal Government
may deal with “matters referred to the
Parliament of the Commonwealth by the
Parliament or Parliaments of any State
or States, but so that the law shall extend
only to States by whose Parliaments the
matter is referred or which afterwards
adopt the law.” No doubt if a plan were
prepared by someone in the Federal Gov-
ernment who cares for literature the State
Governments would be glad enough to
agree to it; especially as they need not
be asked to surrender their right to prose-
cute authors under their own State laws
but merely, before initiating a prosecu-
tion, to submit the book in question to a
board competent to advise on it. The
board should prepare a report on any
book submitted to it which would be
available to the public on request and
which, in the event of a prosecution,
could be quoted in Court as evidence for
or against the author.
Under such a system books might still
be banned in Australia ; and authors and
readers might still object to the bannings.
But at least the bannings would be fewer
and more consistent; the board, presum-
ably capable of distinguishing between a
work of literature and a work of porno-
graphy and acquainted with classical and
contemporary standards overseas, would
not be likely to submit a report that
would justify a Court in sending the
author of a literary work to jail. And,
whatever action the Courts might sub-
sequently take, the board could at least
act as a barrier between the author and
the anonymous wowser, the juryman who
has not read Rabelais, the policeman who
has never heard of Shelley and the Judges
who, as they interpret their duty to
civilisation in Australia, feel obliged to
rely on the opinions of such person's.
The Hero Goes A.W.L.
Jon Cleary’s You Can't See Round
Corners (Angus and Robertson) is not
so much a novel as the repetition of a
contemporary myth.
The myth is this: there is a young man
sometimes called Bill and sometimes
called Tom and in this case called
Frankie McCoy, who represents the
Modern Hero ; in Hemingway’s time he
was a tough guy who grunted and killed
animals and, in a dim way, pursued an
ideal of the heroic; but since then, since
James Cain and Jerome Weidmann, his
wits have sharpened and he has lost faith
in grunting and hunting; he makes
cynical wisecracks of varying degrees of
smartness; he does not believe in any-
thing except fngney; and instead of
shooting giraffes or Fascists he commits
some brutal crime and is, very properly,
jailed or hanged for it.
He is essentially American in origin,
for tlje hero of the contemporary Eng-
lish novel, as has previously been pointed
out here, is either dead or demented.
Perhaps his first appearance in America
was made about 20 years ago in the
novel called Bottom Dogs, of which
D. H. Lawrence said he was glad to
have read it and hoped he would never
have to read another book like it. At
the moment he is most often to be found
in the American detective novel in its
latterday decline the last time the
present reader had the misfortune to
encounter him was in Samuel Holmes’s
Fade Into Murder, where, as a detective,
he was drinking gin and kicking people
on the kneecap but, judging by the
favorable American reviews of You
Can’t See Round Corners, he is still of
interest to serious (daily-newspaper)
literary criticism in the U.S.
Clearly, the Modern Hero means some-
thing to America, Perhaps he means
something to Australia, too, for Cleary
is not the first to import him to this
country. He is the central figure of
Gavin Casey’s two novels.
.The Hero cannot mean anything in a
literary way, as an individual feat of
characterisation, for he is more or less
the same person in all the American
novels, and anybody who can distinguish
Cleary’s version of him from Casey’s,
or either from the American versions,
should be able to make a fortune classi-
fying day-old chicks. He is, essentially,
a communal figure; a symbol; an
abstraction.
Nor, since such measure of personality
as he has is distinctly unpleasant, can
he mean anything in the way of joyous
entertainment. His nature is vile, his
wisecracks cheap and nasty, his deeds
ugly and his intellectual stature lower
than that of a performing pig.
He’ means something as a social
symbol; that is the only interest one
can find in him and that is the only
justification there can be for writing
about him. As Cleary says about his
Frankie —whose story can be told in a
sentence: he goes a.w.l. from the
Militia, murders a girl behind the Syd-
ney National Art Gallery and is saved
from arrest by being killed in a motor
accident—he is “just someone who can-
not beat life.” He represents the failure
of modern man —of some modern men
—in a world where the pressure of war
and money-getting have become unbear-
able.
Here he and his English counterpart
meet. The English Hero—in the fashion-
able novels of the moment —dies or goes
mad when confronted with the difficul-
ties of modern life. The American Hero
and his Australian shadow also die ; but
before they go they do something dirty.
They are not only afraid of life ; they
hate it; everything about it; before
. they die they spit at it; they murder
a woman behind the Art Gallery.,.. •
within whose massive stones, unknown
to Frankie and not mentioned by the
novelist, Gruner’s “Spring Frosts,” an
immortal work of art and beauty, glistens
in steadfast tranquillity.
As a symbol, as the embodiment of a
contemporary myth, as a social phenome-
non, as an image of something which
fascinates, frightens or disgusts the Aus-
tralian community, Frankie does mean
something. We have known deserters,
cowards, blackmarketeers and the Com-
munistic hatred of Society ; we have seen
men who, stripped of their redeeming
humanity to the kind of skeleton Frankie
is, might well enough be symbolised as
“lone, wolves,” recognising no values ex-
cept those of money.
But, as Cleary has handled him,
Frankie is anything but a powerful sym-
bol. To be really effective as such he
would have to’ come to life as a human
being, and he never does that. If he is
dimly and patchily recognisable as a
credible personality in some sentimental
scenes with his mother and in his rela-
tions with his girl-friend, there is abso-
lutely no psychological justification for
the murder he commits, which would
have to be the work of a particular kind
of sexual pervert and which Cleary
attempts to depict as a mere “accident”
of drunkenness.
Up to the murder the novel reads like
an over-expanded short story about a
young larrikin, barely credible and hardly
worth writing about; from the murder
on, when it would have to become an
analysis of morbid psychology, it reads
like a mere detective story, and a naive
thriller at that.
If Cleary is going to write about the
uttermost dregs of humanity, well and
good; there is a place for such writing.
But he might, at least, read Dostoievsky
before his next attempt. He gives the
impression that he is attempting to ex-
plore the labyrinths of a perverted mur-
derer’s soul with a literary background
of American detective novels and with no
more knowledge of life than an ele-
mentary observation of the way adoles-
cents make love. His book, to fulfil his
own purposes, should be a volcanic
eruption out of hell; but it is more like
a kettle trying to boil on a gas-stove
when there is no gas.
Little, obviously,- can be said for the
novel as a work of literature, as distinct
from a social document, when the central
figure is abstract, imitative and uncon-
vincing. The characters surrounding
Frankie—except, perhaps, a publican;
and one may note touches of charm in
the girls—are slight to the point of
nonentity. There is only Frankie; and
Frankie is nothing. The truth is, no
doubt, that Cleary should not be writing
this kind of novel at all. Ife is impossible
to imagine that he will ever become a
volcano. He is not a roaring mad grue-
some genius like Dostoievsky but a blame-
less young man with a talent for por-
traying publicans, for describing charm-
ing girls and for writing quite competent
and attractive prose. He does not, at
least, - grunt.
A Matter of Adversaries.
Irving Stone’s Adversary in the House
(Invincible Press) is described on the
jacket as a sociological, biographical
novel of “power and sensitivity.” It is,
at any rate, sociological.
Mr. Stone, of course, is an American,
the subject of the novel is an American
trade-union leader of socialist persua-
sion, Eugene V. Debs ; and from the time
when, on page 1, Eugene—or Gene —
stands at the window in a long flannel
nightgown, cogitating social and philo-
sophical problems, till the triumphant
conclusion when, on page 368, he is re-
leased from jail and awaiting an audi-
ence with President Harding, background
and incidents are exclusively American;
a kind of abstract Americanism made up
of trade-union politics and polemics, with
a good, syrupy dash of patriotic senti-
ment.
The title refers to the opposition Gene
received in his own home from his wife,
.who had no time for his efforts to amelio-
rate the conditions of the working classes,
no sympathy for his ideological struggles
and torments. And who, therefore, is
portrayed as a monster of a woman. But
since Gene sacrificed his boyhood sweet-
heart to his ideology, forcing her in des-
peration to marry a corporation lawyer
and since, moreover, the lady survives her
lawyer husband and periodically comes
to jail to visit Gene, his misfortunes do
not exactly harrow the heart.
There is, indeed, an adversary in the
novel; the adversary of character-crea-
tion which is comprehended in the term
Social Purpose. And in Adversary in
the House it is colored by a certain slick-
ness which, if it renders the sociology
more palatable, is nevertheless as obnoxi-
ous gs an overdose of treacle.
Mr. Stone’s biographical subjects are
usually ones for which there is likely to
be a good popular demand, and it is
possible to concede that this specimen
has a certain rough-and-popular historical
value. Charitably viewed, it is a
sidelight on American industrial history.
But whatever point there may be in
reprinting it in Australia is obscure.
Twentieth Century Empire: H. V.
Hodson (Faber). A thoughtful study by
the assistant editor of London “Sunday

of specific interest to Australia, immigra-

vidual from State supremacy and als
that, by standing firm as a third urea

Who belonged to the Flemish
School of Painting7
Painting in the “Low Countries”
(outside Holland) had two great
periods. The School of Bruges (1366-
1550) produced painters of religious
subjects much influenced by Italian
art; the brothers Van Eyck, Hans
Memling, Rogier Van der Weyden,
Quentin, Matsys and Mabuse were
the masters of this period. The second
great period belongs to the 17th
century, and produced such por-
traitists as Rubens and Van Dyck, as
well as genre painters such as David
Teniers.

How to destroy bookworms ?
Trusting that you refer to the small,
non-human, grubby type, you may
destroy them by placing a saucer of
benzine in the book-case, keeping the
doors closed. If eggs and larvae are
found, kill the live ones, isolate the
infected volumes, and spray them with
a solution of carbon tetrachloride, a
colorless liquid which does not stain.
Place the books upright, and, being
careful not to wet the pages too
much, try to reach the back edges
with the spray. In using other in-
secticides be sure they have been
tested against discoloration of paper.

The bricks in my newly-built sleep-

of staining the bricks to achieve a
uniform appearance?
A wash can be made by mixing
dry colors, such as Venetian red,
red oxide and Indian red, in water
with a fixative added. One pound of
the fixative, which can be white or
green copperas or alum, should he
dissolved in about four gallons of
water, stirred well, and the dry color
added to produce the desired shade.
The grey bricks will need an extra
wash to tone them near the other
bricks. They must be thoroughly dry
before applying the next wash all over
the brickwork.

(1) Some materials used for plaster-
ing the interior walls of a brick build-

Method ?
(1) Portland cement (3 parts sand
to 1 part Portland cement); in
compo mortar (6 parts sand, 1 part
Portland cement, 1 part slaked and
sieved lime); lime mortar (3 parts
sand, 1 part lime) for a first coat,
and lime-putty and plaster of Paris
(3 parts lime-putty, I part plaster)
for finishing coat; gypsum plaster
and sand. The chosen material should
be of such consistency that there is
just enough water to make it work
easily. (2) For ordinary domestic
work compo mortar, which may. be
finished in one coat, is probably
easiest handled. (3) After mixing
materials in quantities which can be
used within two hours, wet walls
thoroughly. Lay narrow bands of
mortar along top of wall, and again
at sft. below. Rule off these strips to
give straight guides, and fill in be-
tween them with mortar. After
ruling-off, flush with screeds, fill in
slack patches and rule off again. Fill
in minor holes with a wooden float
and bring to a good surface.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Republican U.S.
Weighing the Dewey-Warren
team for the U.S. Presidency—
and, of course, taking it for
granted that the team will win
—London “Times’s” Washing-
ton . corresppndent sees it as
meaning that for the next four
years American foreign affairs
will be in the hands primarily of
four men: Dewey, Warren,
John Foster Dulles and Senator
Vandenberg.
He finds the four reassuring,
each one of them having sup-
ported the European Recovery
Programme throughout. When
the move occurred in their
party’s ranks to pare down the
programme’s allotment Dewey
and Warren were the first two
of the Presidential aspirants to
attack the cuts. Vandenberg’s
support of the great bid to help
Europe and the world recover
is well known jg it is hardly too
much to say that but for his
powerful advocacy the pro-
gramme would have been re-
duced out of recognition, if not
destroyed,
Dulles has been a doughty
fighter in the same comer.
Named as the probable next
Secretary of State, replacing
Marshall, he holds in relation to
Dewey much the same position
that Harry Hopkins held in rela-
tion to Roosevelt.
What it all comes down to is
a non-isolationist leadership of
America—a fair prospect of
some continuity at last in a
hitherto rather unpredictable
U.S. foreign policy. The Lon-
don “Times” man, for instance,
sees Vandenberg’s support of
the “trial” period of one year
for the recovery programme as
meaning only that the Senator
was counting on “having a
President next spring who would
carry the programmes on,” and
“he seems to have got one.”
The Dewey-Warren success is
seen as representing a severe, if
not a crushing, defeat of the old
diehard isolationists who till re-
cent times dominated the Re-
publican party. One of the
staunchest defenders of that
former party line, Colonel Mc-
Cormick, of the Chicago “Tri-
bune,” commented on the
Dewey selection that “it might
have been worse ; it might have
been Vandenberg.” Even that
thought is held by the “Times”
man to be cold comfort. “To a
large extent,” he says, “it was
Vandenberg”—that is, the policy
adopted was Vandenberg’s and
the men chosen were his choice.
For his part, Vandenberg had
all along insisted that he did not
want the nomination ; that he
had dedicated himself to what
he considered the greatest ser-
vice he could perform for both
his country and the world—
establishing the European Re-
covery Programme as a working
concern. When the Republi-
cans had finally picked their
team Vandenberg said: “I don’t
suppose anybody will believe me
even now, but the truth is that I
am pleased and relieved.” As it
is, he will continue to be one of
the most powerful figures in
America.
Vandenberg (64) and Dulles
(60) would have the roles of
“elder statesmen” in a Dewey
Administration, which would
be well on the youthful side
compared with the one it would
replace: Dewey, at 46, taking
over from Truman, 64; and
Warren, at 57, becoming first in
line of Presidential succession,
in this replacing Speaker Martin,
63. “U.S. News and World Re-
port” expects that Stassen (41)
will be fitted somewhere into
the Administration, and it names
as others about whom more will
be heard Elliott Bell (45) and
Herbert Brownell (44).
Despite this apparently promis-
ing set-up, the well-informed
“U.S. News and World Report”
notes that “the whole world
today is apprehensive that
America may waver.” It adds,
regarding the Truman side, that
“nobody can say the present
Administration has given any
evidence of trimming on the
broad international front. There
is no talk on the Democratic
side of withdrawal from world
affairs or of scuttling responsibil-
ities. There is no suggestion that
maybe the source of funds to
Europe should be cut off so that
Americans may have more of
their wants satisfied at a time
when our standard of living is
far above that of any other
country in the world.”
On the other hand, his being
so staunch a supporter of the
European Recovery Programme
“cost Vandenberg the Presi-
dency.” “The Republican major-
ity in the House of Represen-
tatives has already wavered.
The drive toward ‘isolation’ has
begun.” And the U.S. publica-
tion is not at all sure that
Dewey, as President, can stop
that isolationist drive.
U.S. Needs the Oil.
That the overriding U.S.
interest in the Middle East
(including Palestine) is no fancy
altruism but purely oil is freely
admitted by Scripps-Howard
foreign editor William Philip
Simms,
Impatient over suggestions
that there is “something in-
herently rotten” about this U.S.
interest and retorting that the
simple fact is that America’s
national security “depends on oil
more than on any other item,”
Simms adds: “We in the United
States consume more oil today
than the entire world did in
1938. Experts figure that in case
of war the United States would
be short by more than
100,000,000 gallons a day for
military purposes alone. And
our known reserves are dwind-
ling. We must supply our needs
from abroad. In the war of the
future, oil will be more vital
than explosives.” Hence, “The
vital necessity of American self-
preservation and self-defence
makes it impossible to consider
the future of Palestine as some-
thing apart from the future of
Iran, Irak and Saudi Arabia,
whose vast oil fields are coveted
by an expansionist, aggressive
Russia, which would monopolise
them for her own use.”
And hence also, in Simms’s
view, “Unless there is a strong
U.N. capable of assuring all
nations essential raw materials —
notably oil —the Middle East
may become a bloody battle-
ground.”
Resurgent Germany.
The view that the resurgence
of national feeling in Germany
favors the Western side is em-
phatically not shared by former
U.S. Under-Secretary of State
Sumner Welles.
In N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
Welles contends that “Russia
cannot gain supremacy in
Europe unless she can control
Germany,” and that “the pros-
pects for eventual Russo-
German collaboration are
greater today than at any time
since the end of the war. While
the Soviet regime has been in-
flexible in its purpose, the
Western Allies have wavered.
Even now they have no fixed
policy in Germany. For lack
of consistency and because of
administrative incapacity they
have needlessly lost several of
the great tactical advantages they
injoyed in 1945.”
In Welles’s view, three years
ago the defeated and submissive
German people looked to the
Western Powers as their one
hope of salvation from Russia.
Today German nationalism is
resurgent and an increasing
number of Germans believe that
Germany’s survival depends
upon partnership with Russia.
According to Welles,
America’s actions are restricted
by the reluctance of both its
major potential allies: “It is all
very well for General Clay to
announce, with Washington’s
approval, that the Russians
‘could not drive us out of Berlin
short of war.’ But French public
opinion has already clearly
shown that it deprecates any
course in Berlin that might result
in an open clash. And the leaks
from London make it evident
that the British Government is
far from eager, notwithstanding
Mr. Bevin’s statements, to en-
dorse General Clay’s blank
cheque.”
Soviet Incentives.
Looking into “various special
sources” of information lately
made available to it, “Christian
Science Monitor” concludes
that the incentives used to spur
the average Russian, while they
may have produced results,
amount to a sorry retreat from
the original boasted Communist
paradise-of-the-worker pattern.
Trumpeters of the alleged
paradise—curiously mute of late
—once fairly burst with paeans
for the Soviet-Communist whole-
sale destruction of incentives
which caused people to work
under capitalism; self-interest
denounced as bourgeois, equal
wages irrespective of amount or
kind of work; and, to replace
the old incentives, each and
everyone to realise that his
individual good was best served
by furthering the common good.
It not only failed to get things
done.; as the “Monitor” puts it:
“The resulting damage to the
country’s economy was compar-
able to a military invasion. In
practice a premium was placed
on incompetence,” since when
“the socialist economy [in
Russia] has got back on its feet
by the gradual reintroduction of
the old, discarded, pre-Com-
munist incentives.
“In other words, extra rewards
for extra work, special prizes,
coveted privileges, and so on
have been reintroduced” and
“substitution of these bourgeois
incentives for pure Marxism has
brought about some curious
results in, the Soviet State.”
As one result, “inequalities of
compensation and of privilege
are more developed in the Soviet
Union today than in many capi-
talist countries. Nowhere, not
even among the Hindus, is the
caste system more regulated and
more strict than in the Soviet
Union, where the chosen few at
the top of the ladder live behind
high brick walls (in summer
behind high board fences topped
by barbed wire), completely
screened from the public eye,
while at the bottom of the
economic scale the uncounted
outcasts also live behind high
walls and barbed wire.”
One category of incentives in
which the “Monitor” notes that
Soviet Union today excels all
other systems, past or present, is
kudos. Nowhere else in the
world are there so many varieties
and subvarieties of awards,
decorations, medals, and uni-
forms. The awards range from
Stalin first-prizes of 200,000
rubles to free trolley-car passes.
Decorations range from jewel-
studded stars worth thousands
of rubles to bronze baubles
worth a few cents. “Awards are
made for everything conceiv-
able, from nuclear discoveries to
potato-digging. Most decorations
are today distributed not singly,
but in batches of hundreds at
a time.”
But “not even this use of
kudos has supplied the Soviets
with any lasting answer to the
incentive problem. Indeed, the
mass scale on which awards are
employed would seem to argue
that they are rapidly losing their
stimulating properties (apart
from those that include an
honorarium) and have reached
the saturation point.” .
There is, however, one sub-
stitute (of a sort) for incentive
that has been used in the Soviet
Union with unfailing results,
and whose contribution to the
country’s economic construction
and reconstruction has been a
major one —forced labor. “After
achievements like the White Sea
Canal, the Moscow-Volga Canal,
the Trans-Baikal Railway, and
hundreds of other classified
operations all over the country
in which forced labor was the
main factor, Soviet planners are
doubtless sorely tempted to use
forced labor more and more as a
means of getting guaranteed
results with the least trouble
and effort.”
But use of forced labor “is
extremely wasteful of human
beings. Viewed from the stand-
point of the Soviet State, human
beings are just as much a part
of the national wealth as the
factories they build or operate.
Each of them has to be raised,
trained, or educated for the
better part of two decades, and
thus represents a sizeable in-
vestment. But life in a forced-
labor camp at best is not con-
ducive to longevity and hence
to a gopd return on the invest-
ment. Moreover, after the recent
war, even Russia’s seemingly
inexhaustible reserves of man-
power have thinned out some-
what. Besides all this, forced
labor is of necessity sullen and
inferior to that of free men.”
The problem of incentives, the
“Monitor” analysis sums up,
goes far deeper than material
living standards, production
indices, and efficiency ratings.
“As the Nazi experience has
shown, a society may score Very
high on all these counts and
still be an abomination. The
problem of incentives is funda-
mentally one of moral and
spiritual values. It is concerned
with the whys and wherefores
of human behavior, or, in
socialist parlance, with the in-
dividual’s relation to the col-
lective.
“And it is here that Com-
munism’s discrepancies burst
their seams. The employment
of forced labor for Socialist con-
struction is not only Commun-
ism’s admission of its failure in
practice to solve the incentive
problem in a manner that im-
proves on capitalism. It is a
regression from enlightened
self-interest to the earlier, more
brutish standards of feudal and
slaveholding society, no matter
how fine the railroads and
canals.
“To pose the problems of in-
centives on the proper moral
plane, the maxim—by no’ means
exclusive Communist property
—that the ends justify the means
must be stood on its head. The
test is less how many canals,
factories, or other objectives
were completed and how long it
took than how it was accom-
plished, the effect on the human
beings involved, and through
them on the moral fibre of
society as a whole.”
A Churchill Bet.
As brought to light by an item
sold at auction by Sotheby’s
and reported in London
“Times,” the young ex-soldier
Winston Churchill, back in
1901, had a bet of £lOO with an
American, James C. Young ; the
American wagering that “the
British Empire will lose one-
quarter of India, or of Canada
or of Australia before 10 years
are gone.”
The item sold (for £80) was
the signed record of the wager.
No doubt Churchill duly col-
lected ; in those days, at the be-
ginning of his political career,
he could do with any spare hun-
dreds that were going. Not that
he was ever likely to go on a
dole (from his American mother
he had an allowance of £5OO-a-
-year), but he was mostly in debt
through living above his income.
At all events, when he went
to London from Sandhurst in
the ’nineties intending to make
his first speech, he had to pawn
his watch. The great success of
his early war-reporting books
helped him through, but what
really set him up was a lecture
tour which netted him a solid
£lO,OOO.
His bet with the American
was characteristic of his enthusi-
asm for the Empire all through.
It was about the same time that
he chided his future great friend
Lloyd George with taking “a
singularly detached view of the
British Empire.” Lloyd George
was to change; but Churchill
has always been Churchill.
Dragnet Digest.
Soviet Slaves. —Quoting “the best
estimates available,” Scripps-Howard
foreign editor William Philip Simms
gives the number of inmates of Soviet
concentration camps as 14,000,000 in
1946, 17,000,000 in 1947 and
19,000,000 at present. This would
be about 10 per cent, of the total
population, though several millions
are known to have come from the
Baltic States, Eastern Germany, the
Ukraine, Rumania, Hungary and
Poland.

J. Bull Broke. —Americans are not
the only ones depicting a near-
bankrupt Britain. Thus, R. R. Stokes
in London “Times”: “What needs
to be emphasised to the people is
that we are financially broke. The
only way out of bankruptcy is to
spend less and earn more, and until
every single man throughout the
length and breadth of the land under-
stands that, there is not the slightest
chance of our achieving our objective,
which means that once Marshall aid
has run out; if not sooner, the stand-
ard of living must take a catastrophic
drop. Ministers should uniformly
tell the public that these are the facts
and there is no escaping them.”
* * * *
Britain’s Exodus. —Of over 100,000
British migrants in the past 12
months, Australia (says “Wall-street
Journal’s” London correspondent)
secured 25,000, S’Africa ditto, and
Canada 56,000. . The correspondent
states that over 800,000 more are
eager to get out: “These voluntary
exiles and would-be emigrants are
fed-up with nearly nine long years
of queues, cpntrols, shabby dresses
and frayed cuffs and the drab lean
diet of England.”
* * * ♦
Nationalism v. Communism. —The
Kremlin’s slapping-down of Tito, in
a N. Y. “Times” view, revealed that
the further Communism spreads in
Europe the more it is compelled to
face not only doctrinal deviations but
also the century-old national and
cultural differences among the Euro-
pean peoples which have bred both
their passion for national independ-
ence and the personal ambitions of
their leaders based on this feeling.
“These differences,” N. Y. “Times”
commented, “have wrecked all pre-
vious efforts at European unification
by either religious or social systems.”
True enough; but it doesn’t say much
for the chances of the Western Euro-
pean Union, either.
* * * *
Hangover Hall. N. Y. “Post”
columnist Earl Wilson on a recent
convention of world-wide interest:
“When they said this Republican con-
vention reached staggering propor-
tions they meant the delegates were
staggering. So many parties were
given that they may have to name
the place ‘Hangover Hall.’ I guess
the delegates, the visitors and the
hangers-on heard about the bad
Philadelphia water. In a new Declara-
tion of Independence, they refused to
drink it unless it was purified with
Scotch.”
* * * *
U.S. Funds for Israel. All the
time it was merely a matter of
terrorists in Palestine murdering
British troops and civilians there was
little protest in America; it’s different
with Uncle Sam even only indirectly
involved. N. Y. “Times,” for in-
stance, now sees the terrorist group
as presenting a challenge not only to
the Israeli Government but also to
the United Nations, and in particu-
lar to the United States, committed
to partition. “Yet the Irgun Zvai
Leumi, like the Stern group, is being
financed mainly from the United
States,” and “it is difficult to see
how it [U.S.] can escape the duty of
establishing control over funds used
in violation of its international obli-
gations.”
* * * *
Stalin Still the Boss. —As seen by
William Henry Chamberlin in “Wall-
street Journal”: “Stalin is advancing
in years. He will be 70 next year.
He may be slowing down physically,
delegating more authority than
hitherto. And it might have suited
his purposes very well during nego-
tiations with the Western Powers to
create the impression that he was
anxious to be conciliatory, but was
held back by an unmanageable Polit-
bureau. But it seems reasonable to
assume that Stalin is still th£ boss
(high Communist officials in private
talk usually refer to him as the
khozyaien, or ‘boss’) so far as all big
decisions are concerned.”
* * * *
Famine Fears. —Lately there have
been glowing reports about bumper
U.S., Russian and other wheat-crops,
but in a London “Times” letter
former New Zealand Governor-
General Lord Bledisloe refers to the
warning given by both Sir John Boyd
Orr (Britain’s leading food expert) and
Lord Bruce (these days chairman 91
the World Food Council) that within
the next three years “famine is a
possibility, not only in other coun-
tries, but in this”; i.e., Britain. And
when they say “famine” they mean
famine. Meanwhile, Lord Bledisloe
reports that farmers’ confidence, “the
main condition of a maximum food
output, is flagging noticeably through-
out Britain’s countryside today.
Reason: too much export of tractors
and the like which the farmers need;
also, Government failure to gn' e
farmers other essential supplies. The
possible results: “Terrible to contem-

MR. CHIFLEY CHALLENGED.
This concern of the Americans — so
flabbergasting to Mr. Chifley—about pre-
serving atomic and scientific-warfare
secrets from objecting scientists or scien-
tific workers, spies and other “philoso-
phers” ought to be as easily intelligible
to him as the cooking-up of a Budget or
the unravelling of a “whodunit?” It is
so simple, at least to anybody outside the
abovenamed species of the human race:
The objecting researchers hold, or affect
to hold, that instincts of national self-
preservation ought to give way to the
alleged principle that there should be no
secrets as between scientists, especially if
Soviet Russia wants to learn them.
The spies trying by force, fraud and
blackmail to win certain secrets in the
cause of serving Russia agree entirely with
these scientists, and, along with other
Communist agents and traitors, are kicking
up merry hell through strikes and sabotage
among workers in industry outside Russia
in expression of Moscow’s resentment.
The “philosophers,” Socialists of Mr. ,
Chifley’s kidney, are as dumb as those
African ants which continue, despite all
ant experience through one generation after
another, to welcome into the home those
bright-red beetles which lay the eggs even-
tually hatching into a brood that destroys
the ant colony.
Most of these people are doing exactly
what Russia —whose Iron Curtain pre-
serves all its secrets —wants them to do
in the cause of converting the world into
one Communist slave-camp. The Ameri-
cans have been quite fair. They have
offered for the past two years or more to
give over to an international trust the
whole bundle of their atom-weapon
prescriptions and methods provided every
nation agrees to a complete international
supervision of its development of these
secret formulae as a guarantee against
their use in war. Soviet Russia alone re-
fuses. The real hoggers of secrets are
not the “American imperialists” but the
Communist plotters of world-revolution
by violence.
Mr. Chifley has not deceived anybody
in this country or abroad. Like murder,
his sort of “philosophy” will out. Until he
hurried to London the other day he may
possibly have cherished the delusion that
his whole political and “philosophical”
record —since the days when, while the
Empire’s armies were fighting in the
bloodbath of Passchendaele, he joined a
disruptive strike in Australia and aban-
doned his Government locomotive out in
the bush —is not intimately known to
people overseas whose business is to be
informed. But that complacency is surely
shaken now by the revelation that the
United States Government is not giving
him any results of its atom-weapon ex-
periments, or giving them to Britain
either while Mr. Dedman’s scientific re-
searchers are admitted to British secret
laboratories. They don’t trust Mr.
Chifley or Mr. Dedman. And few people
in Australia will blame them.
Plumb on the line drawn by Washing-
ton, there fell from S.-E. Asia, like one of
those guided missiles itself, confirmation
of American suspicions. The outbreak in
Malaya of violence and mass-murder by
Communist bands, aided and abetted on
the spot by some of those Australian
Communist agents of whom Mr. Chifley
will hear no evil —and especially by the
notorious Sharkey, whose record was “not
a disqualifying factor” in the issue of a
passport —led to appeals from the
British Commissioner-General to Can-
berra for arms for the white planters.
Canberra’s reaction was to register in-
ability to help because the Australian
Communist-bossed unions would prob-
ably refuse to allow the arms to be dis-
patched. Up to the week-end some British
arms only had been “released.”
Meanwhile, Sharkey, one of the Aus-
tralian Communists home from the foul
work in Malaya, is going about appealing
to aeroplane-workers .to support the ban
on Government action imposed by the
Communist seamen’s and watersiders’
executives. Mr. Chifley’s Cabinet has re-
mained completely indifferent to what
any real Government would regard as
insufferable insolence.
The reaction against Mr. Chifley
abroad is nothing remarkable when at
home growing numbers of Australians are
coming to ask similar questions to those
put by Mr. Archie Cameron in the House
of Representatives just before the pro-
rogation in June: —
Sooner or later the Australian Govern-
ment will have to tell the people, who are
becoming increasingly alarmed at the situa-
tion, on which side of the fence it stands.
Is it for Western Europe or for Russia?
There can he no accommodation whatever
between Western Europe and what lies east
of the Vistula, or indeed with a great deal
that is west of it. What has the Australian
Government [that “leader of the small
nations” at U.N.O.] to say about the over-
running of Latvia, Esthonia and Lithuania,
the rape of Poland, the downfall of Czecho-
slovakia, events in Austria, Hungary, Yugo-
slavia and Greece? Everywhere... .we are
faced with the same threat.
Mr. Cameron added:
In my own electorate I am constantly
being asked: Is the Prime Minister a
Communist? Is the Minister for External
Affairs a Communist? Those questions
must be answered.
The immediate answer to Mr. Cameron
was uneasy, theatrical laughter from the
“Labor” benches.
Among all that is true, or half-
true, or quite false, one truth is
fixed—and the Americans have oblig-
ingly helped to fix it —namely, that those
questions are no longer answerable in
words alone. No verbal guarantee from
the Prime Minister about the reliability of
his research-officers will suffice for
America, and the damage done by Mr.
Chifley to Australia’s reputation and to
his own is therein reflected. They don’t
trust him. Why should they? Who
trusts him in Australia?
In Parliament he has fenced with every
protest against suspected infiltration of
known Communists or fellow-travellers
into the Post-war Reconstruction Depart-
ment, the Prices Branch of the Treasury,
the C.S.I.R. staff and the union executives
in key industries and services which can
paralyse at will any Government calls to
meet emergency. He has resisted every
demand that a defiant and traitorous
gang, whose leaders own no loyalty to
Australia but only to Moscow, should be
banned as a subversive organisation, or
at least punished as individuals for
offences against the law. He has watched,
without being moved to more than mild
reproof, discipline in industry ruined by
these saboteurs, the welfare of the
country seriously impaired, even his own
party white-anted and “solidarity” in the
unions and in the electorate riven into
rival groups by the dissension created.
•These developments have not stung
Mr, Chifley to any action. He has never
been near an idle mine or an idle wharf,
no matter how long idle. He has never
used the penalties of the statute devised
to check precisely this industrial bush-
ranging. He does not even recognise it
as such, or the obvious malice inspiring
the worst of it; for the Communists, he
holds, are merely giving expression to
their “philosophy.”
The indictment against Mr. Chifley can
be drawn from his own' words. Last
March in Parliament Mr. Blain asked him
how, following the exposure of the selling
by Communist agents in the Canadian
Government service of defence secrets to
Russia, Mr. Chifley regarded the threats
by Australian Communists to the work-
ing of the rocket-range in Central Aus-
tralia, and whether the Prime Minister
would reimpose the ban on the local
Communist party which his Government
had lifted: : —•
Mr. Chifley; Certain people whether
they were Communists or not I do not
know— threatened to place a “black” ban
on the testing range. Legislation was in-
troduced to take care of that Constant
scrutiny of all persons associated is exer-
cised The Government has previously
indicated that it does not propose to place
bans on any class of political philosophy
or thought. Consideration will not be given
to imposing a ban [on the Communist
party].
This happened while a three-year-long
embargo against Dutch shipping tied up
in Australia was still enforced, against
the Government, by the Communist-
bossed wharfies, and while the same law-
breakers, in association with the Com-
munist-bossed seamen and under the
direction of a Communist-party opera-
tions staff, was laying all Queensland
under a nine weeks’ transport blockade
—a blockade condemned with indignant
astonishment by N.Z. Labor Ministers
as a blow deliberately organised and
struck for Moscow against Australia.
Not a week has gone this year without
its demonstration of persistent Com-
munist trial of the strike weapon, on be-
half of docile unconsulted union mem-
bers, against Australian industry. The
leaders who have invoked or threatened
these disorders, demanding always ap-
peasement from the Government or
from industrial tribunals, have gone scot-
free of any punishment, or fear of punish-
ment, from the law. As in Australia, so
before the wider scene—in Europe, and
in S.-E. Asia: Mr, Chifley and his Minis-
ters have looked on inanimate, acknow-
ledging no challenge to their political
way of life, impervious to any impres-
sion of hostility to this democracy, wait-
ing (it seemed) simply to see whether
democracy or Communism would win.
If their hopes were with democracy as
all British peoples understand it, rather
than as the Soviet interprets it, then Mr.
Chifley’s Bank Grab Act was merely a
stupid joke. The final test on that is one
he must shortly meet.
A State for N.Q.
There is nothing new about the move-
ment in North Queensland to form a
State. The desire for regional self-gov-
ernment was strong among the fathers
and grandfathers of the present genera-
tion of northerners, and strong also in
Central Queensland. In each case a
Separation League was formed, and each
organisation had champions (not only
John Macrossan) among the men who
shaped the Commonwealth Constitution.
Towards the end of last century the
Westralian goldfielders raised the cry of
“Separation for Federation.” In North
and Central Queensland it was “Federa-
tion for Separation.” Indeed, electors
of the North and Centre, “hoping that
the separation of those districts, so long
unsuccessfully contended for, would be
easier after Federation” (Quick and
Garran), brought Queensland into the
Federal Union, as the goldfielders did
Westralia, though baulked of their other
aspiration, which the “T’othersiders”
abandoned,
Brisbane was anti-Federal,'so much so
that the politicians who succeeded
Macrossan and other members of the able
Queensland delegation to the 1891 Con-
vention had taken no part in framing the
draft Constitution. When it was perforce
put to the people the metropolitan elec-
torates all polled No majorities, though
the vole in other southern districts re-
duced them to 3657. In the Centre there
was a Federal majority of 2156, “eight
electorates being favorable and three,
Rockhampton among them, “unfavor-
able” : Rockhampton was influenced, not
by “antagonism to Federation,” but by
“a separatist fear of Section 124.” The
North decided the issue. With all its
divisions voting Yes, it polled a Federal
majority of 8993, 1501 more than the
majority for the whole of Queensland —
the figures were 38,488 to 30,996.
But the “Separatist fear” of Section 124
proved only too well founded. The sec-
tion, as finally adopted, reads:
A new State may be formed by separa-
tion of territory from a State, but only
with the consent of the Parliament thereof,
and a new State may be formed by the
union of two or more States or parts of
States, but only with the consent of the
Parliaments of the States affected.
In the Commonwealth Bill of 1891
the wording was different, but the pur-
port was the same. At the Melbourne
session of the 1891 Convention “Mr.
Walker suggested that, to meet the case
of North and Central Queensland, the
power which the Crown then had to sub-
divide the colony should be reserved....
and moved the insertion of the following
clause 9 5 * 1 • ""•*
If Queensland adopts this Constitution
or is admitted as a State nothing in the
Constitution shall be taken to impair any
right which the Queen may be graciously
pleased to exercise, by virtue of the Royal
Prerogative or under any statute, in re-
spect of the division of Queensland into
two or more colonies... .the Common-
wealth to retain power to impose terms
and conditions in respect of the establish-
ment of any such colony as a State.
Support for the Walker proposal came
from the presidents of the Northern and
Central Separation Leagues. But after
the Brisbane Government had been
consulted, and had reported that a “large
section of the inhabitants of Queens-
land” (meaning Brisbane) would hate to
see the Crown so exercising its preroga-
tive, “the proposed new clause was
negatived.” Macrossan could have fore-
seen what followed, but Macrossan was
dead. With Brisbane consent required
and certain to be refused, and with a host
of other matters, wars among them, pres-
sing for attention, separation had to be
dropped.
A multitude of just grievances has
forced the revival of the movement in
the North, and the Centre may follow.
To the still-existing Brisbane ignorance
and neglect of the North —admittedly not
so great as when the old Separation
League came into being, nor is Brisbane
hostility to new States now so evident—
there have been added inept, though ex-
orbitant, rule from Canberra and the
anarchy of Communist and other union
wreckers with southern headquarters.
Southerners know only too well what
these ruffians have done in the way of
stifling transport and production. The
North has suffered far more severely
from their criminal devices. It has been
condemned to put up with shortages
which have become chronic. Its farmers
never know when their produce will be
carried to market or whether it won’t be
left rotting on the wharves. But under
existing conditions its people cannot hit
back, much less secure deliverance from
their oppressors. They could if they had
an Assembly and Government of their
own, with power to bring their unions
under northern, as against southern, con-
trol. And, in conjunction with like-
minded States, they could strike at the
drivelling excesses of Canberra by,
among other things, going for decentra-
lised administration, particularly the ad-
ministration of income tax such as Britain
and other countries have. This would
mean a gain of population, and, what is
better, the newcomers would tend to be-
come servants instead of masters, as so
many officials are now. r
Could North Queensland, by a harm-
less convulsion of Nature, have been
shifted to the U.S.A. it would have been
a State long ago. It has nearly every-
thing Florida has, and more. Florida,
though within its smaller compass a
beef-cattle, dairying, sugarcane-, maize-,
tobacco- and fruit-growing country, like
North Queensland, is, unlike North
Queensland, deficient in coal and
minerals, phosphatic rock excepted. And
albeit one of the world’s playgrounds, it
has in that line nothing comparable to
the Barrier Reef.
The population of Florida, exclusive
of the war-time influx, exceeds 2,000,000.
During the 20 years before the war it
increased at the rate of nearly 50,000 a
year. Given the right to order its own
destinies. North Queensland might, by
1960, match this American State in popu-
lation, as in other things, and become
the world’s most successful example of
white settlement in the tropics. Not only
because of climate and environment, its
people are different from their fellow-
Australians in other parts, and under
regional self-government their individu-
ality would be preserved and accentu-
ated. This, rightly taken, is part of
the case for new States, together with the
nourishing of healthy and necessary twin
loyalties of which they would admit.
Under the archaic division of the
country into six States, with the ever-
growing predominance of Sydney and
Melbourne (they and the subject terri-
tories within their State boundary lines
are to have 80 of the 121 Ms.H.R. if the
Chifley “Government” can bring it off)
we tend more and more to conform to
one type, the city type. We are in danger
of losing the gift of variety, which was
so pronounced among the First Diggers,
who were mostly country-bred, and which
Rebecca West, a shrewd observer, noted
as an interesting feature of the delega-
tions to the Republican Convention at
Philadelphia —that which distinguishes,
say, Yorkshiremen and Virginians from
all their partners, and which has been all
to the good of their countries throughout
their history.
Discovered Again.
Mr. Williams, who holds —very tem-
porarily—Robertson for “Labor” m
N S.W., cast up in Cairns (N.Q.) the other
week as leader of the Federal Parlia-
mentarians taking the sun up there, and
told the inhabitants that the Common-
wealth Government “must” make extra
financial assistance available for the de-
velopment of North Queensland.
Mr. Williams has discovered the north
to be “so vast” and its potentialities so
great” that he doubts whether “full de-
velopment” by the State Government is
possible. He further discovered that this
development is “important for the defence
of Australia” so immigrants ‘must be
directed there” and good roads built,
especially “between Brisbane and Cairns.
The north has grown tired of being
discovered by these wandering politicians,
a process it has been enduring for 40 or
50 years. It is also tired of Canberra,
and it would far sooner have its ports de-
veloped and good feeder-roads built into
them from its hinterland than have speed-
ways built to Brisbane. On this matter or
roads it can’t help wondering which cheeK
Mr. Williams had his tongue in, since ms
leader has clouted on the best part or tne
petrol-tax, which was imposed to raise
funds for roadmaking, and shoves it into
his overstuffed consolidated revenue,
stolidly refusing to make sufficient ot n
available to States and local-government
bodies even for the maintenance of exist-
ing roads. .
Nobody need tell N.Q. that the Bris-
bane Government cannot develop tne
north. Nor can anybody persuade it trot
it is likely to get a better deal from Can-
berra, three times as far away asi distai
Brisbane and as remote as the topmos
Himalayan peak from northern aspir
tions. It has had some pretty shocking
samples of Canberra Government latei>,
especially on the Sugar Coast and#
matters like sea transport and supplies
urgently-needed materials. $

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Miller Case.
To those who have watched the
; Communists run riot in this country, the
revelations of spite and tyranny against
workers unlucky enough to be members
of Communist-bossed unions are not
. new; the trouble has been to convince
others that these evils are rife. Rife they
are. Blackmail and bullying, frequently
accompanied by violence to the victimised
."Unionist and threats of violence to his
.wife and children, are common. And
: the lily-livered Chifley crowd isn’t game
to lift a finger to stop it.
“The Miller case” has been going on
for nearly three years. A. T. Miller, an
..Old Digger, a carpenter and member of
the Communist-run 8.W.1.U., of whose
Oakleigh branch he was president and
}; delegate, and an open opponent of Com-
munism, arose at a branch meeting in
September, 1945, and wanted to know
where the union’s money was going,
urging all branches to examine their
balance-sheets closely. Any hint of a
desire to inspect balance-sheets infuriates
these Communist bosses, and Miller was
fined £2 for “acting in a manner detri-
mental to the union,” the standing charge
against any unionist who dares to criticise
the Corns. Miller, finding that the wit-
nesses against him were also his judges,
refused to pay. His branch insisted that
he be prosecuted so that the matter could
be tested at law, but the Communists
wouldn’t have that at any price.
Miller was working for the Federal
Works and Housing Department, the
Minister being Mr. Nelson Lemmon. A
8.W.1.U organiser appeared on the job,
told Miller to pay the fine by 5 p.m. or
the job would be declared “black.” One
of Miller’s mates asked why the union
didn’t prosecute. The reply:
We don’t believe in the Courts. They
are a capitalist institution. Any man who
has exhausted his rights under union rules
has received justice.
Miller ignored the threat, the job was
declared “black,” and all carpenters were
withdrawn. Miller was suspended, took
his case to the Arbitration Court, where
Judge Kelly declared the fine null and
void. Miller went to work in a Federal
Works Department store. The 8.W.1.U.
declared that “black.” Miller went on
working ; the union fined him another £3.
Miller still works there, on his own. He
says the fight has cost him £l5O. Abusive
and scurrilous leaflets have been dropped
wherever he has worked. All this was
typical of other cases:
Peters, of the Teachers’ Tribunal and a
past-president of Vic. A.L.P., charged with
criticising an election; case unfinished.
Kennedy, president of the Trades Hall
branch of the Clerks (Communist) Union;
fined £1 for accepting a motion criticising
the executive. Spinks, fined £lO for writing
a letter to a newspaper. Hunt, fined £lO
for criticising the 8.W.1.U. secretary
(Chandler). There are still others.
Melbourne “Herald” published details of
the Miller case. Carpenters doing two
separate jobs for the paper were promptly
“pulled out.” Mr. Keon, the Labor
M.L.A. who has fought Communism for
years, declared that Mr. Holloway, the
Federal .Minister for Labor, had invited
Mr. Lemmon’s department to dock the
£2 from Miller’s pay or, if it couldn’t do
that legally, to sack him. Mr. Holloway
denied it, saying “It is too many months
ago for me to remember the exact circum-
stances .... I did not suggest that Mr.
Miller be forced to pay the fine or be dis-
charged.”
The Miller case obviously isn’t
unique. All over Australia are unionists
who have been victimised by the servile
satellites of Uncle Joe. A small propor-
tion of the cases reach the newspapers;
the rest prefer to suffer in silence, and
ifiany knuckle down to this bullying
rather than challenge it. That isn’t to be
wondered at. They can expect no help
from their political leaders at Canberra,
who are bullies themselves against de-
fenceless individuals and arrant cowards
When confronted by a show of force—
particularly Communist force.
White Hope.
He comes in swinging punches:
JA most unusual “Labor” politician is S. M.
Keon, M.L.A. for Richmond (Vic.). Most
unusual for a number of reasons, one of which
is that he really fights the Communist conspiracy
with all the weapons he can use, and never
weakens.
Last week the White Hope said “the rank
j party have had enough of
shadow-sparring with the Red challenge”; and
it can only be hoped that the forthright fellow
r S , not mista ken their temper. In the face
of the deadly Communist menace to Australia
jhome and abroad, in Malaya particularly—
Mr. Lang has forced the Prime Minister to
admit belatedly that his “Government” not
only equipped the Communist Sharkey with a
passport authorising the ruffian to spread his
corruption in India and Malaya but wished
o™ on the very reluctant Indian Government, 1
w “ Q b set a time-limit on his stay—the rank
and file of the party have been silent and inert
too long.
The Richmond in the field was discussing the 1
savage persecution of unionists obnoxious to
the Communist gang. He said it would be
sheer hypocrisy” for the Victorian A.L.P. to
talK about opposing this persecution unless it
was prepared to deal with Federal members
wno condone and abet Communist tactics.”
£Or example, “the member who asked the
Housing Department to make Miller pay the
illegal and unjust fine imposed on him by the
carpenters Union executive or sack him.”
The A.L.P, executive knew of this mem-
ber $ request and so did the Federal Gov-
ernment; but nothing was done about it.
In nominal charge of the Housing Depart-
ment is Mr. Lemmon, a forcible-feeble gentle-
man from Forrest (W.A.), whose sojourn at
Canberra will end next year.
*. f he hadn't given his executive and the
Federal crowd headaches enough for one week,
the uncommonly-different Keon struck a blow
uLn° hn 4* Glon °us John, who has
be«m a cherished, though self-effacing, “Labor”
institution ever since he laid the foundation of
, i mmense fortune in the depression of the
nineties by conducting a Collingwood tote.
Speaking on the Racing “Reform” Bill, which
provides for the forced amalgamation of the
Wilhamstown and Sandown Park clubs, the
man from Richmond predicted that there would

new club would be ‘as much a creature of

» nC i 6 Wren had no champions on the
Labor benches. Too staggered, perhaps.
It was the Country party that broke loose,
S°7 e iU ron V ts ' by Keon allegations
that Wren financed it at the last election to
nelp defeat the Cain Administration because it
introduced night trotting,” and had ex-Premier
Lunstan in the bag.” Hot denials and fierce
expressions came from the C.P. leaders, and
Acting-Premier McDonald offered a Royal
Commission “if Mr. Keon is prepared to give
evidence and make any serious attempt to prove
any of nis remarks about party funds or any
negotiations in any shape or form.”
The turmoil went on for two sittings. At
the second, ex-Premier Dunstan, who was
absent from the first, described Keon as
an unmitigated liar,” and Mr. McDonald,
saying he had never before had any communi-
cation with Wren, produced a Wren cheque
for £lOOO and read a Wren letter to Keon
challenging that worthy to put up £2OO, the
loser’s money, on the decision of an investi-
gator (“any member of Parliament”), to go
to the Melbourne Hospital. A priceless pas-
sage followed:
If there is a spark of manhood in your
composition you will, in order to preserve
the honor and dignity of Parliament, accept
my challenge, thereby enabling me to dis-
prove your flagrantly untrue, irresponsible
and despicable statement.
“The honor and dignity of Parliament”!
Was Keon abashed? He was not. “Challenge
and money,” he said, “are typical of the man
—a man who has fought bis way through life
with money and believes that money speaks all
languages and can do all things.”
I asked for a Royal Commission into
all of Wren’s activities, not only his re-
lations with the Country party. You will
notice that Mr. Wren did not ask the
Acting-Premier to appoint a Royal Com-
mission which would have power to send
for documents and subpoena witnesses.
Mr. McDonald interposed, not with a ready
acceptance of a test that would make or break
Keon, but with a gibe unworthy of him: “You
are a moral coward.” The Acting-Premier
should know that a member for an industrial
district who comes out against Wren takes hitf
political life in his hands.
The Coal Outrage.
After six weeks of gas and power restric-
tions, of threats of severe penalties against
householders who use a radiator or boil
a kettle outside permitted hours—though
none against coalminers who refuse to
mine coal within permitted hours—New
South Wales citizens now face the pros-
pect of a complete blackout, or at the
least the loss of more coal than has been
saved during the whole period of restric-
tion.
Last week the Joint Coal Board, evi-
dently tired at last of granting more and
more concessions and getting less and less
coal, applied to the Coal Industry
Tribunal for variations in the award.
Main changes asked were:
(1) Miners to work five days before and
five days after a statutory holiday (instead
of one before and one after) to qualify for
payment for the holiday.
(2) Annual leave payments to be based
on one day’s pay for each 15 consecutive
shifts worked.
Immediate reaction of the Miners’ Federa-
tion was to threaten a one-day strike,
whereupon Premier McGirr rushed into
conference with the Coal Board on “the
general question of increased coal pro-
duction.’ He had previously had a chat
with miners’ leaders, and on Wednesday
he told his party he felt sure there would
be a distinct improvement in production.
While he was telling them this the Coal
Industry Tribunal, which is another name
for Mr. Gallagher, was hearing the Coal
Board secretary report that almost
1,000,000 tons of coal had already been
lost this year through union action. Mr.
Gallagher warned the Miners’ Federation
president of the seriousness of the pro-
posed stoppage and suggested the stop-
work meeting be held at the week-end.
Communist Williams sought to bargain
by saying that if the proceedings were
stopped there would be no hold-up, but
Gallagher stood firm and ordered:
(1) That any aggregate meetings of miners
called next week, under the resolution
passed by the Central Council of the
Miners’ Federation on July 29, must be
held outside working hours,
(2) That neither officers nor members of
me Federation should advise, encourage,
induce, or incite members to hold such a
meeting within working hours.
(3) That members of the Federation
should not attend such a meeting within
working hours.
He told the poisonous Williams that if it
was his view as a union-leader that the
Federation was entitled to lose 50,000 tons
of coal, then “it is time the law of the land
is altered so that control is assumed from
union leaders.”
Williams went away to think things
oyer. Presumably he and his colleagues
discussed the matter and decided that, re-
gardless of what the Gallaghers might
think, the Chifleys and McGirrs could be
relied on to see that “the workers,” as
represented by Communist and near-
Communist leaders, were not “crucified.”
Next day they announced that the stop-
page would take place tomorrow (Thurs-
day). Actually slopwork meetings started
on Monday, with heavy coal losses.
Mr. Gallagher has very wide powers
to deal with a situation of this kind. He
can inflict a fine of £lOO or six months’
imprisonment on any person who fails
to comply with his order; he can, if an
application is made, deregister the Federa-
tion. A joint statement by Chifley and
McGirr that they were prepared to back
up any decision made by the Tribunal,
and to enforce any penalty inflicted by
him, might have averted the threatened
tie-up—if the mischief goes on it could
easily become a general coal strike. But
the past performances of the Prime Minis-
ter and his Macquarie-street echo give
little hope that they will take such a stand.

It has leaked out that Canberra has sent
help—of a sort —to Malaya, and without
any protests from seamen or wharfies. The
Malayan Government asked it for assist-
ance in establishing an income-tax de-
partment. This was something Chifley
could understand, and he responded
generously. In less time than it takes a
taxation officer to say “extension re-
fused,” seven of the breed, “released”
from the Federal service, were installed
in Kuala Lumpur. Coinciding closely
with their arrival came the Communist
terrorist outbreaks. Old hands in Malaya
say the Red bandits are a temporary
menace only. They’re not so sure about
the taxation blokes.
Coal Industry Tribunal Gallagher to
Communist Williams:
You have said that, if this hearing pro-
ceeds, certain industrial action will be
taken. That amounts to an interference
with the administration of justice, and since
it is committed by a combination of per-
sons it amounts to a conspiracy to prevent
the ordinary course of justice It is open
to any man in the State to go to a cham-
ber magistrate and lay information to bring
the offenders before a Court of law.
Mr. Gallagher then made an order for-
bidding the calling of an aggregate meet-
ing in working hours and forbidding
officers to advise, encourage, induce or
incite members to call or attend such a
meeting. The Federation’s reply was to
summon a meeting for tomorrow (stop-
pages actually started on Monday). It
remains for a “man in the State” to go
to a chamber magistrate. Perhaps Mr.
McGirr will do so. Perhaps he won’t.
One of the less serious sidelights on
Sydney’s gas shortage is the argument
whether air sucked into the pipes through
open jets when the supply is cut off is
registered by the meters, with a conse-
quent increase in gas bills. Various “ex-
perts” say yea ; the gas companies say
nay; customers pay their bills and
wonder how much they are paying
for air. Hot air, the only contribution
made by “Labor” politicians to the end-
ing of the coal shortage, doesn’t get into
the pipes. It is paid for by the public
just the same.
Two statements recalled when Aus-
tralia was awaiting the High Court judg-
ment in the banking case. (1) Chifley on
the second reading of the Grab Bill;
October, 1947:
The Government decided to assume
greater powers over banking so that the
financial policy of the Commonwealth
Bank would be in harmony with the general
economic and financial policy of the Gov-
ernment The Government believes in a
publicly-owned and -controlled banking
system in which final responsibility is in the
hands of a Government directly responsible
to the electors
(2) Dr. Evatt to the High Court:
The Commonwealth Bank is controlled
by the governor, who is not under any
obligation to the Crown and has his own
discretion.
So, in a paraphrase of the old Cabinet
prescription, “It doesn’t matter a damn
what we say, even if we don’t say the
same thing,”
In gangster films the favorite spot for
handing over the hush-money, the ran-
som for a kidnapping or any other hot
dough is alongside a bridge on a deserted
country road. In Sydney, too, money
changes hands on bridges, and some say
it’s not all Harbor Bridge toll-money.
In the Garden case the former “liaison-
officer” alleged that he had parted with
a parcel containing £5OOO in notes on
Newtown Bridge. Last week a taxi-driver
who admitted belonging to a syndicate
which “snatched” cars at the pegged price
and resold at,a thumping profit told the
Court he had arranged to meet a pro-
spective seller and pay him on Newtown
Bridge. So the seller took delivery of a
parcel, which he found too late con-
tained only £237, the pegged price,
instead of the agreed £450. If many
more stories like these get around it’ll
be hard to find standing-room on New-
town Bridge.
Sydney “D.T.” had an article, spread
over six columns (with sketch) in praise
of Finnan, the McGirr Minister of Labor
and Industry. One extract:
Finnan overrode some Caucus objections
and saw through the House a bill making
home deliveries compulsory. He says he
is determined to enforce it.
The “D.T.’s” hero began with butchers.
After weeks of sulphurous threats which
accomplished nothing, he whined that
prosecutions had been “held up” because
housewives wouldn’t become informers.
Judging by the “D.T.’s” account of his
recreations he will heal his bruised soul
by reading thrillers “in the Chifley tra-
dition” and going fishing.
One night last week a brilliant meteor
with a red head and a green tail or a
green head and a red tail or some kind
of head and some kind of tail flashed
across the Brisbane sky and “exploded in
a burst of flame.” Earlier suspicions that
it was Doc. Evatt on another flight,
plumage and all, were without founda-
tion. The meteor burst.
Pamphlets urging people to “Join the
Labor Party and help to build a greater
Queensland” were on display at the
Health and Home Affairs Department
(Brisbane “Courier-Mail”). As the im-
print showed, they were published by
the A.L.P, and printed by the Govern-
ment Printer. TTi) G.P. is permitted to
accept private orders, and, according to
“a Government official,” the party would
be charged normal rates for such a job.
The A.L.P. said nothing. Paid for or
not, it is unwise for a Government de-
partment to print party propaganda.
Unwise is hardly the word for a depart-
ment which distributes the stuff —unless,
of course, it does so “at normal rates.”
A dispute about a Queensland Govern-
ment lottery prize has gone from the
Supreme Court to the Full Court and
thence to the High Court. In that august
tribunal Chief Justice Latham was moved
to say “Every tenth shop in Brisbane
seems to be a Golden Casket office.” The
eminent C.J. refrained from adding that
these “offices” are blots on Brisbane’s
name, as well as on its streetscape, and
that in all the English-speaking world
such sights can be seen only in parts
of Australia where “Labor” is in, or was
“in” long enough to introduce lotteries,
and in Eire.
Tasmania’s three “Labor” Ms.H.R. are
uneasy about the Assembly poll, especi-
ally as State and Federal electoral dis-
tricts are the same. One with special
cause for uneasiness is Duthie, who was
a minister of religion when he ousted
Allan Guy in Wilmot on September 28,
1946. Duthie will be plied with awkward
questions if he decides to take the plat-
form for the Cosgroves, and all Wilmot
hopes he will.
A Communist-party circular placed in
Sydney letterboxes blames the gas cos.
for the shortage of coke, tells housewives
to write to them demanding coke, and
announces that the Communist party “has
written to the member for East Sydney,
Mr. E. J. Ward, urging him to see that
the Australian Gas Light Company be
instructed to deliver coke to all flats in
this area.” Three points arise: (1)
Where are the companies going to get the
coal to make the coke? (2) What power
has the Minister for Transport and
External Territories over the gas com-
panies? and (3) What power has the Com-
munist party over Mr. Ward?
A bricklayer newly-arrived from Man-
chester claims that he can lay 2000
bricks a day. He won’t get much chance
to prove it in Sydney, where the union
looks with disapproval on anything be-
yond 400 a day. Of course if he goes in
for week-end work he’ll find plenty of
competition—working on unofficial jobs
for unofficial pay that doesn’t go into tax
returns, Sydney brickies can lay more
bricks in a Saturday-and-Sunday burst
than they manage during their 40-hour
week.
McCormick’s Chicago “Tribune” is at
us again, this time urging the handing
over of New Guinea to the Japs. Doc.
Evatt isn’t very well qualified to speak
on behalf of the Diggers who died win-
ning back New Guinea from Mc-
Cormick’s proteges, but if he should run
into the Colonel in London he might
take a leaf out of Billy Hughes’s book
of 30 years ago. Lloyd George recorded
a clash between President Wilson and
W.M.H. the last time an American sug-
gested giving part of New Guinea to
Japan. Said the President: “Mr. Hughes,
am I to understand that if the whole
civilised world asked Australia to agree
to a mandate in respect of these islands
Australia is still prepared to defy the
appeal of the whole civilised world?”
“That’s about the size of it, President
Wilson,” Billy replied.
Unearned increment? The Horticul-
tural Improvement Society’s site in Vic-
toria-street, Melbourne, opposite the
Trades Hall, was reserved in 1889 for
the use of the society. The Clerks’ Union
at present holds it, pays an annual rent of
£273 and sub-lets it for £683. The amount
of horticulture done on the site wouldn’t
amount to a bunch of capeweed.
O’Sullivan, N.S.W. Minister of Trans-
port, intends to call for a report on
causes of tram accidents over the past
12 months. Aren’t these accidents re-
ported as they occur? And if not to the
Minister, then to whom?
Pearl of rhetoric from Barry, the
“Labor” member for Carlton (Vic.):
Fuel merchants are waiting for the thou-
sands of tons of invisible wood being sent
to the invisible merchants for delivery to
the 20,000 invisible homes not built by the
last Government.
Barry was Housing Minister ff in the last
Government.”
Pre-dissolution jitters must have
attacked Tasmanian Treasurer Madden
in the dying hours of the Assembly,
stricken down three years before its time
—there will be no more five-year Parlia-
ments if the Opposition has its way. He
read a second-reading speech on a bill to
increase Public Service Pensions and, in
committee, moved an amendment to
clause four. The bill contained only three
clauses; Madden had read the wrong
speech. He is one of the four “Labor”
members for Bass, one of whom seems
certain to be looking for a job after
August 28.
With the north-west N.S.W. wheat-
stripping date about 11 weeks away, a
N.S.W. railway official had to admit that
his railways couldn’t possibly shift the
11,000,000 bushels of bulk wheat —there’s
also about 25,000,000 bushels of bagged
stacked in the country—in country silos
in under 16 weeks, and that only if trains
could keep up their present running. The
coal paralysis has cut bulk-truck figures
by nearly half. Bagged wheat is not be-
ing shifted, and mice, weevils and other
vermin are energetically supporting the
efforts of the Communist vermin on the
coalfields.
Mr. Williams (Lab., N.S.W.) led his
touring Parliamentarians into the Sugar
Coast at the week-end and promptly told
all who would listen that he was satisfied
with the loading rate on sugar ships that
“he had seen.” Whereupon the Innisfail
canegrowers’ representatives retorted that
ships were leaving with large parts of
their freight space empty so as to main-
tain sailing schedules, and the Williams
delegation rushed off to inspect a zamia
palm or something.

habitation of 35,000 men, women and
children who have known recurring
shortages of food and everyday necessi-
ties during the war and since:
During the railway strike they were
threatened with actual starvation because
of an economic boycott imposed by
southern union officials. In those days
there were no visits from Federal politicians.
Not one member acknowledged the plight
of North Queensland. Not a whisper or
murmur of encouragement or hope came
from the South. It was the forgotten North
in earnest.
New-Staters are determined to make it
the remembered North in future.
Steamed-up and “boiling-mad,” as he
got off the ’Frisco plane in Sydney,
McKell’s cousin Arthur threw off heat
over press reports that he had been de-
ported for using U.S. mails to distribute
N.S.W. lottery tickets:
I was charged on five counts, I was
not convicted. The Judge said I could
stay till my visa expired (July 24). My
job was selling Australian literature to
American ex-servicemen. I sent names to
my company in Australia and lottery tickets
were enclosed in the answering letters.
I wrote back home for dollars to defend
myself. No reply. Now I owe dollars to
American friends. A frame-up! When I
said I was an Australian Americans thought
I was a Com.
Which somehow recalls Samuel Butler’s
lines on the Discobolus abandoned in a
Montreal lumber-room, and its owner:
“I, sir, am a person of most respectable
connections —
My brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr.
Spurgeon.”
O God! O Montreal!
Dedman, who in matters connected
with Corns and defence secrets doesn’t
know whether he is coming, going, or
running round in circles, has done a lot
of talking, mostly through his hat. It’s
his favorite bleat to point out that Com-
munists never win elections and usually
lose their deposits. No one with any
sense imagines the Comrades care a
copeck about winning seats in Parlia-
ment. Their mischief is done through
their control of Red-anted unions—
wharfies, seamen, miners and other
organisations in whose name they wield
power without responsibility. Why should
Healy or' Williams worry about getting
into Parliament when by staying outside
the one can dictate the country’s foreign
policy and the other can throw a black
curtain over all industry?
It was dinned into the democracies’
ears throughout the recent wars that
victory would bring us a new world.
Who wouldn’t swap it for the old one?
Only Chifley knows whether he still
regards Communism as a philosophy, but
ex-servicemen’s organisations are making
it clear that they recognise it as an alien
menace. The R.S.L. took steps to ban
the comrades from membership from an
organisation which has been Imperial
from the beginning, though the legality
of the ban is being challenged. And the
Legion of Ex-servicemen has now
appointed a vigilance officer who is to
“set up an organisation to counter Com-
munist activity within the Legion.” Two
years ago it barred the Reds from office-
holding.
Henry Wallace to the “convention” of
his “third party,” which is out for the
Communist, negro and Jewish votes; “If
I were President there would be no crisis
in Berlin.” True enough, and there would
be no Americans, no British, no French
there either. There would be no Mar-
shall aid, no attempt to avoid a Russian-
dominated Europe and rto hope for a
harassed world. Fortunately Wallace has
about as much chance of becoming Presi-
dent as Gromyko has of becoming Pope.
McGirr’s Minister of Education, Mr.
Heffron, opened a new technical school
at St. Mary’s last week and announced
that tenders had been let for a new high
school at Penrith. This, he held, proved
that the McGirr Government was carry-
ing out a policy of “decentralisation.
Penrith is about 30 miles west of Sydney,
St. Mary’s between the two. It is about
700 miles from there to the State’s
western border. But anything more than
10 miles from Macquarie-street is “the
bush” to the McGirrs.

It is not generally known that Earl
Mountbatten had been given command
of the First Cruiser Squadron (B.
21/7/’4B) as far back as April, 1947.
Appointment as India’s Viceroy delayed
acceptance. Men of the First C.S. will
be proud of their new chief; an officer
must be almost a legend in his own life-
time for three-badged sailors to state
publicly they’d follow him through hell
and high water. An instance of Mount-
batten’s handling of men occurred when,
as Supreme Commander S.-E. Asia, he
boarded an Australian destroyer in
Colombo. His cox’n brought the
admiral’s barge up too fast; it shot past
the gangway. Half the ship’s company,
the quarterdeck staff with pipes and a
guard drawn up watched the cox’n’s dis-
comfiture as the officer of the day bawled
zealously “Go round again! ” Next time
he slid in perfectly. As Mountbatten
leapt nimbly on to the gangway, instead
of flailing the cox’n with a look that
might mean 14 days’ leave-stoppage, he
called! “Made it nicely that time, cox’n.”
The guard presented arms with a smack
that carried across the harbor.
There are few of us not interested in
taxation—particularly now. J. P, Hannan,
Melbourne and Sydney barrister, knows
enough about the subject—he’s written
a thesis on principles of taxation which
has gained him the first doctorate of laws
conferred by Melbourne University in
the past 16 years. A rare distinction —
among the few doctors of laws in N.S.W,
are H. V. Eyatt and Frank Louat—the
doctorate is given for a work of “excep-
tional merit, originality and research.”
Hannan’s treatise, begun as an article on
characteristics of capital expenditure and
expanded into a 500-page book, is now a
recommended reference-work for Mel-
bourne Uni. law students, now required
to pass also in taxation principles.
Hannan served his articles with the Com-
monwealth Crown Solicitor in Melbourne,
came to Sydney in 1922 and was ap-
pointed to the State’s Taxation Board of
Review. Of hope to taxpayers, the board
will hear their appeal even if the Taxation
Commissioner wholly disallows their ob-
jection to assessments. Naturally pleased
with his degree, Hannan is even more so
that it has emphasised the ability of a
“colonial lawyer” to compile a standard
work of reference.
Norman Cohen, new secretary of
the Melbourne Ex - prisoner - of - war
Relatives Association, spent nearly three
years in Changi and nine months on the
Burma-Bangkok railway, had cerebral
malaria, bronchial pneumonia and beri-
beri all at once, was bashed the usual
amount and lost five stone through star-
vation. He attributes his survival to meat
extract, of which he bought a quart pot
before entering Changi gates. Cohen be-
lieves in one good Jap. This one asked
him if he would teach him English.
Cohen did, and in return the Jap took
prisoners’ personal possessions to Singa-
pore and sold them to Chinese merchants.
With the money he brought food back to
Changi. Battalion records carefully kept
by Cohen have been of immense advan-
tage to p.-0.-w. organisations. He kept
them up-to-date in Changi and even on
the Siam railway, bringing them back
intact.
“Trade Wind”: Award of the British
Empire Medal to one New Guinea
native and the King’s commendation to
four others is recognition of a splendid
team of guerrillas. Such a one was Turi,
an Aitape police-boy—a Fuzzy-wuzzy,
but no angel. His patrol-officer would
back Turi’s rifle against a pigeon’s
eye every time. Turi followed Japs in the
jungle for six weeks, sending back infor-
mation, before they caught him. Taken
to H.Q., he was questioned, refused to
talk, and was beaten scientifically on the
kidneys and tied to a post for the night.
By morning he’d chewed his ropes
through, and with every Jap gun in camp
represented by a knot in a bit of fibre he
made back to patrol H.Q. Turi got his
revenge on Nip stragglers, though even his
p.-o. was inclined to doubt his casualty-
list until, in village after village, queries
regarding newly-filled graves invariably
brought the explanation “Him Jup-fella

Thousands who never knew him or heard
his name have sung, in hut and shearing-
shed, in roadside shanty and drover’s
camp his bush ballads—particularly “The
Brokendown Squatter” and “Sweet Belle
Mahone,” The Bulletin, half a century
ago, published many of his verses, of
which “The Western Mail” is best remem-
bered, Born in Victoria, he jackerooed
for the Rutledges, of Bungendore
(N.S.W.), before going to Queensland as
secretary for a contractor on the South-
Western Railway. At the beginning of the
’eighties he took over the cattle-station
Durham Downs, near Roma, where he
prophetically wrote “The Brokendown
Squatter” for The Bulletin. The 1902
drought featured him as male lead in that
part, and he never “saw the old stock-
yards again.” But the role was only a
temporary one, and he rebuilt his fortunes
on Garrabarra (selected by him in the
raw), and grew grey as a prosperous
squatter and the chieftain of a clan of
fine young Australians.
Walking along Colfins-street in 1944,

wide-organisation with h.q. in Melbourne,
Colonel McArthur its energetic secretary.
Political but non-party, the league func-
tions to push down any head that should
rise to destroy the Constitution ; it took
a big hand in the defeat of the recent
referendum-bid. Thrice wounded and once
gassed in the 1914 war, McArthur came
home a cot-case, but when fitness returned
ho joined the 49th Battalion, Royal Mel-
bourne Regiment, rising to the command
in 1935. A keen student of international
affairs, he acquired his early appetite from
a Cambridge man, Matthews, a member
of the Secretariat of the League of
Nations who delivered a series of lectures
in Melbourne in 1928. In Hitler’s war
Colonel McArthur was L.H.Q. Inspector
of Administration for Queensland.
A master of his craft retires:
The encyclopedia defines stereotyping as “a
process of producing duplicate printing-plates
from a form of type or blocks by pouring
molten metal on a matrix made in plaster of
Paris or papier-mache,” but for the past 45
years The Bulletin has had a simpler definition
—“Jack Donnelly.” A nephew of the first
stereotyper in Australia —James Armstrong, who
came from Scotland to the Melbourne “Age”
and later opened his own business —Donnelly
was apprenticed to his uncle in 1893 and came
to The Bulletin 10 years later. His plant
was primitive—a two-feeder flat machine and
a metal-pot with a capacity to cast two plates
—and his staff one boy. Over the years he
kept himself, his plant and his staff —all, like
the first boy, Donnelly-trained men—abreast
of the latest developments in the stereo, game
and maintained his reputation as a master-
craftsman. Jack could turn his hand to any-
thing. Years ago when William Macleod, artist
and Bulletin general-manager, made a series
of plaques and busts it was Donnelly who
bronzed them by the electro-deposition process.
His tour de force was a Macleod statuette of
Livingstone Hopkins, showing “Hop” in a
characteristic bowling-green attitude. Macleod
wanted it cast in bronze and asked Nelson
Illingworth’s advice. The sculptor told him
that such a delicate job could be done only
in France or Japan. Donnelly persuaded
Macleod to let him try the deposition method.
The statuette was only 10 inches high and
the task involved eight separate moulds, the
pieces to .be fitted together after the metal had
been deposited, but Jack made a perfect job
of it. Years later when Frith began caricatur-
ing in clay and plasticine Donnelly was again
co-opted to give the models permanent form;
he cast them in metal. Jack has a quick wit
and a ready tongue, and just as no one* has
ever seen him beaten by any problem of his
craft, in verbal exchanges he has never been
stumped for an answer. He retired last month
and his departure leaves a big gap in The
Bulletin building; Jack’s bright eye and cheery
word will be missed.
Shortly to arrive in Melbourne as Chief-
. of-Staff to Sir Winston Dugan for Royal-
visit duties, Major-General Charles
Harvey Miller was here before as
Chief-of-Staff to the Duke of Gloucester.
He is 54, was educated at the Royal
Military College, Woolwich, was twice
wounded in the 1914 war, and in the later
one served under Alexander in the
Western Desert, Tunis, Sicily and Italy.
He commanded the Transjordan Frontier
Forces for four years, and later a regi-
ment of Hussars and the sth Cavalry
Brigade.
“H.H.”: The memory of Thomas
Edward Campbell Henry, who died at
87 at Portland (Vic.), will live on because
of a personal diary he kept meticulously
for 70 years. A surveyor, town clerk,
architect and company auditor, he began
the diary in 1877, when he was articled
to a surveyor chaining the bush between
the South Australian border and Warr-
nambool. The district was then riddled
with police searching for the jailbreaker
and “gentleman sheepstealer,” MacDon-
ald. Except for a couple of years in
W.A. under Surveyor-General John For-
rest, Henry spent all his life in the land
of his boyhood ; he was reared at Hey-
wood. In 1888 he was appointed sur-
veyor and town clerk for the borough
of Portland, which positions he relin-
quished only two years ago. He was
prime mover and director of practically
every benevolent and commercial enter-
prise in sou’-west Victoria. He bought
his first typewriter in 1893 and owned
the second car in the district.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Linked with Mayne
Lynton in his “Julius Caesar” (B, 14/7/’4B)

Australia’s long-distance Shakspearean
actor. Neville started his career in the
Christchurch (N.Z.) Theatre Royal as a
mere infant in “Richard the Third” ; in
early manhood he joined up with Alfred
Dampier—also a good Shakspearean—
and after Dampier had finished was the
No. 1 man with Allan Wilkie right
through his Australian tours. Since
Wilkie’s exit he has been the stand-by of
Shakspearean plays for pupil audiences.

ring in 1941 to H.Q. in Gaza round about
the time when Seventh Divvy wounded
were coming in from the Syrian cam-
paign. Next halt was,the 2/4 Convales-
cent Depot in Egypt, then back to Aus-
tralia and the 2/1 Convalescent Depot at
Rocky Creek on the Atherton Table-
land. Coming south again, he took over
command of 102nd A.G.H. at Tam worth,
shifted it to Brisbane, and, after the war’s
end, settled in as CO. of Yaralla, re-
maining there as medical superintendent
when Repat. took over from the Army
last year. Yaralla, like most Australian
hospitals, is suffering from staff shortage,
but a training school instituted by Fitz
Hill is gradually making up the leeway.
South Australian scientist J, S. Gooden,
who went to England with a scholarship
offered by Professor Marcus Oliphant,
has collected his Ph.D. at the University
of Birmingham. He is now at the Nuffield
Research Laboratory directing the con-
struction of a proton synchroton which
will be the largest and most powerful
atom-splitting machine in the world.
Into the silence;
In Adelaide, at 85, Henry Chesson, veteran
of the early S.A. Labor movement. He lost
his seat in the Assembly on the conscription
issue, being for universal service.
In Melbourne, Edwin (Ted) Page Kennedy,
Carlton footballer, 1904-11, and a member
of the Bruce-McGregor-Kennedy centre line
which helped his team win three premiership
pennants. He was a League delegate for many
years and a life-member of Carlton and the
V.F.L.
In Sydney, at 64, George Fitzpatrick, an
odd character interested in charitable organisa-
tions for over 30 years.
In Melbourne, at 74, Solomon Wertheim,
one of Australian Jewry’s leading figures. With
Rabbi Brodie he founded the Australian branch
of the Women’s International Zionist organi-
sation in 1932. At his death he was honorary
president of the Jewish National Fund of
Australasia.
At Glenelg (S.A.), at 67, Alexander John
Morison, former Town Clerk of Adelaide. Son
of the late Dr. B. P. Morison, he started in
civic affairs as a cadet in 1895, became an
authority on early Adelaide history, and was
interested in town-planning and urban develop-
ment.
In Hobart, at 65, Dr. James Sprent, noted
skin specialist. He was District Naval Medico
during the first part of the 1914-18 war, and
subsequently with the A.1.F., winning the M-C.
at Mouquet Farm in 1916.
In Sydney, after half a century with “S. M.
Herald,” Charles Theakstone, 78. Tasting ink
as printer’s boy at Dubbo, setting type by hand,
he joined the “Herald” in 1888 as compositor.
Seven later he was reporting, becoming
Federal political correspondent in Melbourne.
In 1907 he was promoted to Chief of the Re-
porting Staff, and, three years later, to Chief
Sub-editor. He held this post for 28 years.
In Sydney, at 75, Victor Neilley. Chief cashier
of the Commonwealth Bank for 24 years, he
was seconded to the Bank of England in con-
nection with recovery of gold from wrecked
Niagara, checking its arrival in the salvage
ship.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Melbn”: Despite its clumsy language,
the “Commonwealth Gazette” hits the
nail on the head sometimes. In a recent
request for the nomination of two doctors
to join the Antarctic Division of the De-
partment of External Affairs it stated;
Vacancies two medical officers—to take
up duty on a remote sub-Antarctic island
to care for the health of 15 men and con-
duct such medical research as may be
applicable.
Then it added “Will be required to take
up duty in Melbourne some weeks before
departure for familiarisation.”

“Jasby”: If you wait long enough you
can always get evidence to support any
theory you please to believe. Years ago
I knew an old hand who swore that
more misery and trouble were caused by
soft drinks than by all the beer in the
world. In particular he inveighed against
ginger-ale—“that brown, fizzy stuff that
gets up your nose,” he used to call it. I
wonder if he read the report of a recent
case in Perth. Four men got 20 days’
•jail for being found drunk in the Gov-
ernment Gardens, According to the
police they had been drinking methylated-
spirits, lighter fluid and ginger-ale. If
they’re wise they’ll never touch ginger-
ale again.

“Craiser”: It is unlikely there will be
a political scandal over a recent whole-
sale shower of gifts that fell on members
of Victoria’s Legislative Assembly. They
were 65 morocco-leather, gilt-edged, in-
dexed and illustrated Bibles donated by
L. G. Irish, of Windsor. The distribution
was made while the Racing Bill was
under discussion.

“S.E.R.”: Let’s hope “Clooter’s” (B.
7/ 7 / ’4B) suggestion that modern quacks
might emulate Dr. Frank Crane is not
taken seriously. Years ago my Dad was
arguing with an insurance salesman.
Losing his temper he said “Man, you
talk such damned rot you ought to be
a Labor politician!” Believe it or not,
the bloke stood at the next election, got
in and was a member until his death. He
had the grace to cfijme and thank Dad for
the idea!

“Yorky”: One of the best aspects of
eating lunch at a Sydney railway refresh-
ment-room is the endearing and enduring
quality of the roll. You tear off a piece,
pop it in your mouth and roll it round
whilst awaiting the soup. The soup
comes and you spoon it into yourself,
allowing it to sift past the bit of roll,
thoughtfully surveying your fellow-
diners and reflecting on the mobility and
changefulness of the human visage. The
next course arrives, you poke the bit of
roll into your cheek, giggling inwardly
as you remember the facility with which
monkeys do the same thing, and pre-
pare to explore the unchartered mysteries
of the gastronomic terra incognita before
you. Anon surveying the empty plate
and feeling like Ulysses, “sad for forepast
losses but glad to have survived at any
rate,” you rediscover the wad in your
cheek and proceed to absorb your tea.
That done, you surreptitiously remove the
bit of roll, smuggle it on to your saucer
and depart, though not without a back-
ward glance at the remainder of the roll
on your plate, speculating why people
should fear the destruction of rubber
estates in Malaya when a product the
toughness, elasticity and availability of
which leave rubber miles behind is given
away free with a two-bob lunch.

“Ken-Em”: It is a common experience
to see in shop windows chessmen set up
on the board; as* often as not the board
is wrongly placed, with the black square
at the player’s right instead of the white.
Unk White’s sketch (B. 14/7/’4B) com-
mits the same error, and to complicate
still further a very tricky game he has
drawn a board with 72 • squares. No
wonder the poor old fellows sank into a
coma.

“Gravelsnatcher”; A party of Cypriot
farmers who landed at Darwin en route
for Sydney complained about the ac-
commodation, and the event made news.
An identical complaint registered by
their countrymen a few winters ago
created an outsize in headaches for the
commandant of a p.-0.-w, camp in Ger-
many. One morning about 30 Cyps
were missing. Investigations were fruit-
less, guards were doubled, the camp
floodlit each night, but every morning
the roll-call showed a gap in the Cyps’
ranks. The entire camp was herded into
the open and stood to attention all day
with a very brief respite for recreation
before being bedded down for the night;
“Not yet-not yet! I'll tell you when!"
and that brief respite was enough. The
Gyps gathered in their usual corner for a
game of some outlandish nature involv-
ing the use of a tarpaulin to hold the
chips. Periodically, unseen by the guard,
a corner of the tarp. was raised and
another Cyp disappeared into a sewer-
drain and commenced an unenviable
mile crawl through filth to freedom. They
might all have escaped, but the Aussies
discovered the ruse. The next evening
the Gyps’ game was replaced by a two-
up ring. There must have been a score
of men down that drain when the two-up
developed into a fight for priority and
the guards intervened.

“Wusslean”: Having struggled for the
last three years to get a home of my own
built, I am interested in the report of
the Minister in charge of the C.S.I.R.
that, by using redgum offeuts, enough
flooring could be obtained for between
700 and 800 homes a year. An experi-
mental floor has been laid, and produc-
tion of the flooring depends, it seems,
upon someone gathering together all the
waste material from fence-post and
sleeper-cutting, carting it to a central
plant for seasoning and machining and
thereafter marketing the material which
—to use Dedman’s own words —“could
be dried into well-seasoned, reasonably
straight boards for flooring,” I wonder
how long it will be before Deddy dis-
covers that stringybark slabs from dis-
used outback shanties and sheds would
provide, when collected and suitably
treated, reasonably watertight roofing for
umpteen Australian homes.

“Ike Hollar”: The hotel proprietress
who concluded that William IV, when
Duke of Clarence, “would pay up like a
gentleman” her bill for £7OO for the
damages of a drunken frolic (B. 21/7/’4B)
was lucky to be paid. Bill Four was not
famous for honoring his debts. London
papers, when he was first Duke of
Clarence, were scathing in some of their
comments —no paper today would dare
be so plainspoken about anyone. Bill’s
chariness about settling an account was
said to be responsible for the arrival on
these shores of Australia’s first com-
poser, Isaac Nathan. Nathan had under-
taken for the duke a “confidential mis-
sion” to pay off a lady who was black-
mailing the princeling from France. He
used his own money and cash borrowed
from friends for expenses and the final
pay-off. His patron didn’t part up, and,
his debts falling into the hands of his
enemies, Nathan fled to Australia. Up
to his death in the ’sixties (he was killed
by a horse-drawn tram in Pitt-street,
Sydney) Nathan continued to petition the
British Government to honor the bill of
the long-dead Bill.

“Bo”: You strike phenomenal
memories in all walks of life —Randwick
(Sydney) tramway workshops had a store-
man who could instantly give the number
of a motor and that of the tram it had
been put into years before —and there
were hundreds of trams. I grant the ex-
cellent memories possessed by successful
quizzers covering a multitude of subjects.
But surely no subject has produced more
really great memories than music. Every
top-flight virtuoso of the fiddle and the
piano must be mnemonic master of hun-
dreds of works, great and small. Many
great conductors know every note of
dozens of symphonies, any one of which
may be in length up to 40 minutes, and
conduct them without reference to the
scores. And music produced the greatest
memory the world has known. When
Mozart was 14 he went to Italy with his
father. During Holy Week in Rome he
heard a performance in the Sistine
Chapel of Allegri’s great Miserere, of
which it was forbidden to make a copy.
Young' Mozart drank in the long work,
then went to his lodgings and wrote the
whole score out, being chagrined later to
find he had three notes wrong! Hear-
ing of it, the Pope summoned him, and
the lad went, expecting excommunica-
tion. Instead he was given the Order of
the Golden Spur, But at 28 Mozart sur-
passed even that feat. He had a
commission to compose a violin sonata
(K. 454) which was to be performed by
a celebrated lady violinist, with himself
at the piano. It was his habit to arrange
the work mentally, down to the last note,
before committing any of it to paper.
Delaying too long, he had only time to
write out the violin part. The piano por-
tion he played straight from memory.

“Laetitia”: The experience of “At-
lanta’s” police official (B. 21/7/’4B), be-
fore whose approach a perfectly inno-
cent Chinese fled in characteristically
guilty fashion, recalls another early
N.Q. instance of the Celestial’s reverence
for the law. One of a newly-transferred
sergeant’s first callers was an almond-
eyed son of the Flowery Land who pre-
ferred a sizeable wad of notes with the.
explanation, “Me finish pay tax allee one
time,” Without waiting for a receipt
John smilingly bowed himself out, to be
recalled by the sergeant’s demand:
“Hey! Come back here. What tax is
this?” Urbanely John replied: “Sly-
glog tax. I pay him evely month to ser-
geant,”

“Hamfat”: The periodical Shak-
spearean renaissance reminds me of
Oscar Asche and his marvellous memory
for the Bard. Asche, son of a theatre-
loving Sydney Bung who ran a popular
hostelry facing George-street and having
the Victoria Theatre in Pitt-street as an
appendage, grew up in association with the
stage, mainly Shakspearean. Jules Grant,
while Asche was playing at the King’s
Theatre, Melbourne, showed the actor a
pile of steel-engravings of scenes from
Shakspeare. Without hesitation and with-
out any reference to books Asche wrote
beneath each the quotations fitting the
scene, adding exact details of play, act
and scene. Oscar made most of his oscar
from “Chu Chin Chow,” which was only
a glorified pantomime; but he certainly
had a knowledge of Shakspeare.

“Hoop”: After he had performed the
amazing feat of sifting a drama out of
our Parliament, a friend who writes radio
plays became rattled in his search for an
Australian refrain for musical effects,
“The ideal,” he told me, “would be ‘Ad-
vance Australia Fair,’ but it has degener-
ated from what some of us thought was
our National Anthem to the hackneyed
fanfare for the national news. I’ve writ-
ten the play for a commercial station,
and when it comes on X don’t want people
dialling away from it whenever the re-
frain is broadcast. So I’m risking There
Is a Land,... ’ with the hope that the
A.B.C. won’t collar it for anything be-
fore my play comes off.”

“Zake”: Sydney’s two gas companies,
which get the shakes every time a sea
blows up which might delay a collier
from Newcastle for a few hours, have
been asked by Cahill, Minister for Local
“Government,” to explain why they have
reduced pressures in the mains, as he is
“concerned” about the effect this might
have on industry. This doling-out of their
commodity could, of course, be a con-
spiracy on the part of the companies to
reduce their turnover and so nark their
shareholders by making less profits—a
favorite device of big companies. The
reasons why pressure has had to be re-
duced are actually threefold. They are
( a ) the steep rise in the price of snapper
fillets; ( b) the tendency of book-ends to
go farther apart when another book is
placed between them ; (c) the decrease in
popularity of the peplum for the spring
fashions. I sincerely hope the two com-
panies point these out to the Minister
with an urgent request that he bend his
unique talents to their solution so that gas
pressure can again be restored to normal.
* * * ♦
“Pawang”: I can’t agree with
“Balander” (B. 21/7/’4B) in giving the
credit for the mildness of the latest epi-
demic of ’flu to science and the sulpha
drugs. I would give it to Nature. People
who survived the 1919 visitation took a
mild dose of the disease and probably be-
came immune. This immunity seems to
be capable of being passed on from
generation to generation, so the present
one may thank the last for the fact that
the latest contagion brought few deaths.
The immunity theory seems the only
feasible explanation of the fact that
smallpox and other dire diseases con-
stantly break out in the insanitary walled
cities of China, run their course and
disappear without any preventive mea-
sures being taken except visits to the
Temple of the,Health God. The wog,
having done its dash through the bodies
of the unimmunised section of the popu-
lation, has nowhere to go and dies of
inanition.
“Dee”: For a layman it is dangerous
ground, but “Balander” (B. 21/7/ ’4B) is
almost certainly right in his guess that
we’ve missed a disastrous post-war
pneumonic influenza plague such as that
after 1914-18 because of the sulpha
drugs, plus penicillin. My wife went
down with pneumonia a few weeks ago,
and in one week-end absorbed enough
sulphadiazine and penicillin to stock a
chemist’s shop, but lived to tell the tale.
The medico at a sanatorium where she
convalesced told her that this year had
produced a record crop of convalescents
from pneumonia. Other hospitals have
had similar experience, and doctors have
been shooting sulphadiazine into thou-
sands of patients not ill enough to get
into hospital.

“Ceg”: “Wellsbach’s” par. (B.
23/6/’4B) re lamps and mantles reminded
me of a country doctor who had a kero-
sene-lamp which had a mantle of a type
very hard to get. The lamp hung low
in the lounge-room, and as nearly every
visitor banged his head on it the doctor
would mutter curses about clumsy people
who didn’t look where they were going-
I crashed into it one day and shattered
the mantle. The owner was away, so I
dashed off to the store in the hope of
replacing it. The store had none. But
the maid put me up to a wrinkle. Kill a
large blowfly and place it carefully down
die chimney of the lamp so that the corpse
rests alongside the broken mantle. B
worked like a charm. The doctor re-
turned with his evening paper and lit the
lamp. His remarks about blowflies were
illuminating even if the lamp wasn’t.
“I WILL” AND “I WON’T.”
“When Mr. Chifley says ‘I will’ he means I will,

Packed and precise! The Doctor, one’s inclined
To think, had that old couplet in his'mind,

An admirable attribute, says you.

And sober second thoughts just held to be
An evidence of inconsistency,

Doc. Evatt says is flattering or not.
When Chifley says “I will,” if asked that he

Firmness to stick to such subservience

Whether it works for public good or ill,

“Shavia”: With the Canberra talking-
shop in recess, I am safe from the fate of
a laborer charged at the Hindmarsh
(S.A.) police-station recently, but woe
betide me when the next session starts!
Neighbors called in the law when loud

“Uco”: Courier planes in New Guinea
(B. 28/7/’48)? I never copped any of
the ice-cream or roast chook, but I was
often in on the daily papers. Nearest I
got to the luxury tucker was when a
small detachment of anti-tank blokes
alongside us caught a huge ham. Our
unit was looking after their rations, so
they brought it along to our cooks for
boiling. Our mouths watered in anticipa-
tion, and every man in the battery
walked past the cookhouse to get a
glimpse of the prize and to tell the cooks
what good fellows they really were. But
anticipation was as far as we got with
that ham. Half an hour later came an
order for the battery to move on a few
miles. The anti-tank blokes stayed put.
So did the ham.

“Muskeen”: I wonder if any of
Grimm’s fairy stories have been bowdler-
ised for modern youth (B. 14/7/’48)?
Some of these were fairly shuddersome,
but others had a distinctly romantic
flavor. For instance, there is the story of
the princess incarcerated at the top of a
high tower who was in the habit of let-
ting her long tresses hang out the win-
dow so that her prince could use them
as a rope up which to climb. In the
course of time a princely little pledge
made its appearance, and this event, no
doubt, gave rise to the saying of “letting
her hair down,”

people who believe that after 50 a man’s
muscles' have passed their prime. A
once-celebrated member of the profes-
sion called on me in my office recently
and started reminiscing about his feats
of the past when he was a Tivoli head-
liner. I asked him when he had retired
from the exacting business. “Retired?”
he said. “I haven’t retired. I’m still in
active practice, but nowadays I can only
get engagements at smoke-socials or
suburban parties. But I’m as spry as
ever.” And the 73-year-oldster answered
my incredulous look by lifting one leg
and placing it flat against the wall and
remaining in that position while he con-
tinued the conversation.

“Plop”; I’d complied with young
Judith’s demand for a nocturnal drink,
and paused for a while on my way back
to bed to watch auntie, still seated by the
radio, wide awake, helping us win the
Ashes, She barely noticed me, so I took
a pew in the corner, the only fitting place
in the circumstances for one who be-
lieved that to be enjoyable cricket must
be of the picnic variety in which slips-
fieldsmen may be seen rolling smokes
between overs. Crouched at the con-
trols, auntie occasionally referred to a
newspaper “crib” which showed the field-
ing positions mentioned by the an-
nouncer, and occasionally she closed her
eyes as if by telepathy she were trying to
tell the batsman where he would find a
lane to the boundary. When Bradman
snicked one she fished into her bag for
“In future We Want real Scotch — front-row stalls can see Fifi shudder

smokes, and I noticed for the first time
the heap of butts in her ash-tray. When
Bradman neared his century she stood
up, pacing the room for a while, and
when she saw me still with her she
rattled off the batting order, told me the
batsmen’s averages, their faults, their
favorite strokes. She concluded that the
wicket was crumbling and that the use of
the heavy roller had been debatable
ethics. When the new ball came on she
took out her knitting and, like the women
spectators at the French Revolution,
purled away, glancing up only when a
bumper seemed likely to take a head with
it. “Just a few more minutes,” I told
her, “and I’ll turn in.” I was still there
when Harvey came in and hit the win-
ning four.

“Bybren”: There’s no need to reintro-
duce the pie-carts (B. 7/7/’4B) —they are
not yet extinct. Adelaide still boasts at
least one, which takes up its stand outside
the G.P.O. every evening. While still
serving the dish that was popular a
couple of decades ago, the stall has suc-
cumbed to a few modern innovations.
Dobbin has been superseded by an ex-
Army truck, and from the roof of the
vehicle a Neon sign blazes its message
across Victoria-square and beckons the
home-going movie fan. “Floaters” may
not be the delight of culinary connois-
seurs, but it takes determination to resist
the savory aromas that radiate from the
pie-cart on a winter’s night.

“Curate’s Egg”: It’s a pity the old
gentleman claiming 4o be Dan Kelly (B.
21/7/ ’4B) is not so prevalent these days.
Time was when the paucity or plenitude
of such gentry was an index of national
prosperity. A senior member of Queens-
land’s police force once remarked that
the State was certainly in low water be-
cause, at the moment, it could boast of
“All right! All right! I’m putting the rest around the corner .”
only seven genuine Dan Kellys. Queens-
land had a later version of the Kellys
in the Kennif brothers, who were con-
victed of the murder of Doyle, a police-
man, and Dahlke, manager of Carnarvon
station at the head of the Warrego River.
Paddy Kennif was hanged; James was
sentenced to life imprisonment. After
serving 1£ years he was released. Though
the trial took place over 40 years ago the
school of thought that the Kennifs were
unjustly condemned is not dead. Ten
years ago, at Augathella, not far from the
scene of the tragedy, I saw a ding-dong
fight which arose from an argument on
the subject. Last time I saw Jim Kennif
was in 1929, when he was leading a quiet,
law-abiding existence nearly a thousand
miles from the locality of the murders.
But in the distant south-west there was a
spate of “Jim Kennifs,” whose beery
blatherskite contrasted with the reserved
demeanor of the real Jim.
“X.Q.X.”: Thumb language (B.
7/7/ ’48)? We embarked before
Churchill’s “thumbs-up” sign reached
these shores, and at sea we didn’t hear
much of what was going on. As we
steamed up the Clyde we crowded the
decks shouting and waving to the spec-
tators on the shore or on passing boats,
and the invariable reaction roused us to
frenzy. “Here we’ve come ten thousand
miles to fight for the so-and-sos and they
give us that,” was how one gunner put
it. Fortunately the light dawned before
we landed or the war situation, already
grim, might have been complicated by
intra-Empire hostilities,

“Young Sljm”; Say what you like
about the Yanks, but they fed us for
years in points north. At Mios Woendi,
their big torpedo-boat base, and for-
tunately our corvette base, their store-
men turned a blind eye to the souvenir-
ing that went on. One day, though, they
unsportingly put on a new guard who
apparently knew naught, and cared less,
about hungry sailors. When Blue picked
up a tin of corn and opened it we jumped
a yard when the new man shot him neatly
through the foot. Ructions followed.
High-ranking officers organised a search
of our truck and discovered about four
times more stores than we were entitled
to. It took nearly a case of the old man’s
whisky to square them off, and for
months after that we drejy our rations
from Hollandia.

“Carlyle”: Threatened closure of the
school at Jackson’s Creek (Vic.) through
lack of housing for the married “schoolie”
resulted in direct action by parents of the
eight scholars enrolled. The five farmer-
parents concerned put their hands in their
pockets and between them raised £l4OO.
One gave a corner of his grazing land,
and in two months a six-roomed house
was erected and ready for occupation.
Nominal rent, firewood gratis and free
transport to the nearest big town are
added inducements to make “schoolie”

now defunct, and was also the outlet for
a considerable area of rich agricultural
land. Road and rail transport have killed
its sea-borne trade, and tenders have been
called for the removal of its two wharves.

was given by a Washington spokesman in
commenting on the Berlin fracas when he
said that ‘Many of Marshal Sokolovsky’s
statements do not jibe with the facts.”
“To jibe” (Danish gibbe ) is “to agree.”
My grandmother was the only person I
ever heard use it in this country.

“F.R.P.” (South Africa): That
memorial to the horses of the Desert
Corps (B. 21/4/’4B) reminds me that at
Port Elizabeth, Cape Province, there is a
monument to the horses of the Boer
War. A horse fully saddled and bridled
in the manner of the mounted infantry is
about to take a drink from a bucket held
by a kneeling mounted infantryman. As
the horses in that unpleasantness had a
particularly rough spin, it is rather in-
congruous to note the sleek, well-
groomed appearance of the sculptured
neddy, but he is very much “alive,” with
an eager look to his drink.
“Clqoter”: I have lately been fasci-
nated by a friend who has become a
vegetarian. Formerly a hearty meat-
eater with a preference for steak in what
the Americans call a “rare” condition, he
unwittingly entertained me with the spec-
tacle of himself wading through plates
of shredded carrot, raw cabbage, mashed
potatoes and so forth, topped off with a
couple of bananas or a few apples. I
was able to trace what might be called
a gradual lowering of enthusiasm for
these herbivorous repasts ; he had taken
to masticating the vegetables in a some-
what thoughtful silence, casting covert
and rather covetous glances at my own
dishes of meat. The end came when both
of us were invited to the house of a
friend, who wasn’t at home when we
arrived. His wife invited us to rest until
her husband came. “I must leave you
for a moment,” she said. “We’re having
curried chops, and I must have a look at
them.” She went to her kitchen and I,
thinking to warn her against serving meat
to my friend, arose and was about to
follow her when a low voice growled
“Sit down, you ruddy fool!”

“F.R.P.” (South Africa): Norwegians
are not the only ones who fall down on
the English “J” (B. 21/4/’4B). The back-
veld Afrikaner also makes a hash of it.
On one occasion one informed me that
the storekeeper in a country town was a
“Ewe.” On my asking for elucidation of
this phenomenon he said “Don’t you
know what a Ewe is? It’s a Jid.”

“Waddlin’ Willie”; Winding-up of the
£24,000 Victorian Mining Accident Relief
Fund announced recently in Melbourne
recalls Australia’s blackest tragedy—the
1882 Creswick mining disaster. Just be-
fore Christmas, 1882, 27 men working for
the New Australasian Mining Co., at
Creswick, 12 miles from Ballarat, were
trapped by floodwaters breaking through
from an abandoned shaft. Pumps quickly
brought to the shafthead made little dif-
ference to the water-level, but after 24
hours’ solid pumping water began to drop
slightly and voices were heard faintly.
Immediately this message reached the top
wives and parents thought their entombed
bnes were safe. Two divers from the
Cerberus, of the Victorian Navy, arrived,
but their 100 ft. of pipeline was too short.
Rescuers subsequently broke through
after 50 hours’ solid pumping, to be
greeted by five of the trapped men, who
had been swept to the high section of the
tunnel by the rush of water. The other
22 had perished. Interest from the fund
—obtained by public subscription —cared
for the 19 widows and 60 children, the
last of whom died recently.

“Pawang”: Professional psychiatrists
and psychoanalysts, judging by their
public utterances on human problems, are
very conventional people, but there is one
Australian member of the craft who seems
a bit unusual. A patient told him that he
had an unfortunate obsession for club-
footed women. Whenever he saw one he
felt intense excitement and he feared he
was perverted. “That’s all right,” said the
psychiatrist. “There’s nothing .abnormal
about that. I’ll introduce you to one of
my patients. She has a club-foot.” He
arranged the meeting, a wedding followed
and the couple are reported to be per-
fectly happy.
GLAMOROUS ATHLETES.
“Of all the women here for the Olympics, the
Australians are easily the best-dressed and the most
glamorous.” —London representative of Sydney
“ Women’s Weekly.”
Pleasant to learn our girls in this far setting
Are with such keen appreciation viewed,
To be assured they fairly top the betting,
.With native charm so lavishly endued;
Still, ’twould be foolishness to be forgetting
No points are scored for simple pulchritude
In these Olympics held ’mid Wembley’s buzz.
Right there it’s “Handsome is that handsome
does.”
In these our mimic gladiatorial tussles,
Contests more suitable for modern nerves,
It’s the competitor who hardest hustles
• Bears off the crown such prowess best
deserves;
Speed and agility and well-trained muscles
Are more important things than shapely
curves,
While all appurtenances such as dress
Sink into temporary nothingness.
Greek athletes, their historians have asserted,
Who donned the cestus or who hurled the disc,
Or their pedestrian faculties exerted
In Marathons or sprints as brief and brisk
As those we know, refused to be diverted
By women’s presence, wouldn’t take the risk
(Whatever it might be) of letting dames
Bend curious eyes upon their storied Games.
How different now, when Dians in the making
On measured tracks as swift as shadows swish
Or skim the hurdles, noisy plaudits waking,
Or throw the reedy javelin, should they wish,
Or cleave the water, coolly undertaking
The role therein of mermaids—or of fish,
Or use those implements to hit the breeze
Of which the Greeks knew naught, like skates
and skis.
Here’s luck, you girls! And may the heartening
clamor
That hails a win be now and then your lot.
But never mind the dresses that enamor,
More weighty attributes than these you’ve got
To show. However enviable glamor
May be, it isn’t this that hits the spot
In these Olympics. How you look amounts
To little when it’s what you do that counts.

The 74-year-old Colonial, one of Aus-
tralia’s big-five mutual life offices, writes
ordinary, industrial, accident and sickness
contracts in the Commonwealth, New
Zealand, S. Africa and Britain. And its
latest accounts exhibit health and vitality
in all matters upon which soundness and
progress depend. New business and total
income both reached record levels, the
divisible surplus increased, bonuses to
policyholders were maintained at the
previous year’s levels, a tight hold was
kept upon controllable outgoings, the
basis of valuation of policy liabilities was
further strengthened, the margin of actual
over assumed rate of earning is suffi-
cient to ensure maintenance of present
reversionary bonus rates, and there has
been a change in investment policy de-
signed to strengthen future earning capa-
city.
In the two life departments £32,497,874
(up £5,000,898) of new business was put
on the books, of which 85.4 p.c.
(£27,767,354, up £4,500,873) was ordinary
and the balance (£4,730,520, up £500,025)
industrial. The average amount per
policy (£1157, as against £6BB three years
ago) was a record, too. Group assurance,
a line pioneered by the co., is largely re-
sponsible for the rise.
The year’s total income from all
sources was £1,002,751 stronger at
£8,969,241, of which £7,180,540 was
premiums and £1,788,701 interest, etc.
After paying all legitimate claims
(£3,171,814) and exes. (£1,561,370) there
remained £4,236,057. Of this sum
£68,311 was used to write down the book-
value of assets and £34,500 was sent to
the staff fund. The other £4,133,264,
together with £75,000 from contingency
reserve, was added to the life and acci-
dent funds, raising them to £46,704,673.
This substantially exceeded all actuarial
and other liabilities, and policyholders—
there are no shareholders —could see
£1,050,721 of contingency and other re-
serves besides.
The surplus available for distribution
(excess of assurance and accident funds
over actuarial liabilities) increased by
£48,876, It was made up as follows:
1940. 1945. 1946. 1947.
Surplus: £ £ £ £

Total .. 1,004,418 1,238,852 1,072,077 1,120,953
The amounts distributed in bonuses, etc.,
were £785,793 ordinary, £92,922 industrial
and £37,514 accident; balances were car-
ried forward. Bonus rates on ordinary
whole-life contracts ranged from 255. p.c.
on policies less than five years in force to
60s. p.c. on those 45 years old or
Leaving taxes out of the reckoning,
exes, took 15.7 p.c. of net premiums in
the ordinary and 30.2 p.c. in the indus-
trial section, compared with 15.7 p.c,
and 31.3 p.c. respectively for the previous
year. In common with other offices, the
co. has ceased writing new industrial
endowment contracts of less than 25
years’ duration; this because of the Gov-
ernment’s cheap-money policy and high
taxation, and consequent shrinkage in in-
terest earnings.
The gross rate of interest earned on
mean funds in the three departments was
£4 Is. lOd. p.c. (down lid. p.c.), and the
net rate, after deducting taxes, was
£3 13s. 7d. p.c. (down sd. p.c.). The valu-
ation rate was lowered from 3 p.c. to 2\
p.c. in the industrial section, and a
further large slice of ordinary con-
tracts was valued at the lower rate, too.
At an early date all policies are to be
valued on a 2\ p.c. basis; reserves neces-
sary for the purpose have been accumu-
lated. The aim is to protect future bonus-
paying capacity.
In search of more adequate income
than is to be had from Government
paper, attention has been turned to in-
dustrial securities and mortgages:

Remarks by chairman W. J. Cleary at
the annual meeting suggest that the board
has followed a conservative line in declar-
ing what is, nevertheless, the largest profit
shown by Mark Foy’s in 20 years. Stock
valuation has been as cautious as the
present uncertainty warrants, Mr. Cleary
said, and should survive “any weakness
that may develop in the general price
structure.”. No doubt the removal of
clothes-rationing has also permitted some
trimming of stocks in recent weeks; and
the withdrawal of Federal subsidies on
wool, cotton and textiles should prop
existing inventory values —whatever other
effects it may have. /
In the face of rising costs and the
narrow profit margins laid down officially,
current retailing profits have been pos-
sible only because of phenomenal sales.
The monetary value of turnover is more
than twice the 1939 figure, and the notable
persistence of this post-war boom may
be seen in the latest entries of the follow-
ing table, which gives relative movements
in sales compared with corresponding
periods in the preceding year;

The figures cover a comprehensive range,
including foodstuffs. Clothing made a
rather hesitant start in 1948, but by March
sales were 16 p.c. higher than a year
previously. Relatively, the strongest items
are now electrical goods (up 120 p.c. on
1947) and furniture (up 30 p.c.)—lines
which Mark Foy’s has just transferred to
the second store (across the way from
headquarters in Elizabeth-street) after its
rehabilitation from war-service.
Neither the co.’s retail turnover nor
the output of its clothing factory at
Mascot (Sydney)' is published, but al-
though the gross profit rate is described
as “much lower” than pre-war, last year’s
gross (£728,026) was £33,027 better than
in 1947 and nearly twice the 1939 figure.
Expenses (including tax, which isn’t
itemised) were £604,116, or 83 p.c. of
gross—a ratio which is a shade better
than that in 1939.
The £21,683 rise in net profit partly
results from the abolition of War-time
(Co.) Tax, although strictly the 1947
figure also should be credited with eight
months’ provision for that tax which
wasn’t ultimately payable but has appar-
ently been added to internal reserves. On
the figures presented, last term’s net profit
was 19.9 p.c. of ordinary capital after
paying the prefs., compared with 15.9 and
13.2 p.c. in the two previous years.
Balance-sheet figures show a net in-
crease of £18,857 in fixed assets, after
unstated depreciation, and a £37,506 rise
in stocks ; to meet these additions and to
reduce liabilities by £14,583, cash was
drawn upon for £19,977 and debtors re-
paid £17,735:

On balance, current assets exceed liabili-
ties by £373,638, an improvement of
£14,378. The co. has emerged from the
war with finances greatly strengthened.
Turnover remains buoyant so far this
term, and one headache is gone with
rationing; on the other hand, costs are
still mounting, the State’s handling of
price-control is yet an unknown quantity,
dollar imports may be further restricted,
and the removal of clothing subsidies may
tend to price some lines beyond the pub-
lic’s purse. The remarkably sustained
climb in retail turnover must eventually
level off, after which the expense rate
will be the paramount question, Mark
Foy’s £1 ords. have net tangible cover of
31s. each ; at the current price of 51s. 3d.
and on the basis of the latest div., the
yield is 4.8 p.c. The prefs. at 295. each
(backing 81s. 3d.) yield 4.1 p.c.

This 64-year-old produce, station-sup-
ply, agency and carrying business now
has 24 country branches in Victoria and
17 in N, S. Wales, as well as offices in
the two capital cities, and a new store
has been opened at Mt. Gambier (S.
Aus.) since the close of accounts. The
marked growth in earnings since war
ended reflects pressure of shortages, ris-
ing values and a policy of expansion by
absorptions and otherwise. Profit shot
up from £17,617 for the year to Jan. 31,
1944, to £48,335 for the 12 months
covered by the latest accounts, when the
improvement was £9182, thanks largely
to a saving of £7OOO in provision for
taxation (£35,000) following abolition of
War-time (Co.) Tax. Over the same
period the div. stepped up from 7 p.c. lo
10 p.c., and was sweetened, in Nov.,
1946, with an issue of 50,000 new fl
shares at a premium of ss. each. The
issue was in the nature of a bonus to
shareholders because of the high price at
which the scrip stood in the market.
Turnover advanced again last term,
the growth in merchandise sales more
than offset the shrinkage in fodder sales
owing to the good season. The £48,335
netted by the parent and its subsidiary—
P. W. Pty. (paid capital £5000), which
looks after the wholesale end of the busi-
ness —was 19.3 p.c. on capital as against
18.7, 16.3, 15.5, 8.8 and 8.2 p.c. back
to 1943. After repeating the 10 p.c. div.
and whisking away £BOOO to doubtful-
debts reserve, £15,335 was added to
visible accumulations (£182,453).
To ease the pressure of outside money,
65,000 new £1 shares were issued at a
premium of 16s. 6d. each in May
last. The premium, which, all things con-
sidered, is a heavy one, was fixed by the
Capital Issues Board, which has never
made a clear statement of its policy in
this matter. When all the money on the
new issue is in paid capital will be
£315,000, and reserves will benefit by
£53,625 of share premiums, which will
make 10 p.c. on the new shares worth
only 5.5 p.c. A 10 p.c. div. on total
capital will then call for £16,835 less than
was netted last term. Another good sea-
son and maintenance of satisfactory
prices are in sight, which augurs well for
merchandise sales. There has, however,
been a stiff increase in wage and other
operating costs ; so, while profit margins
remain pegged, turnover will need to keep
on expanding if net earnings are to be
maintained.

Norseman Gold Corporation N.L. was formed by Western Mining

Phoenix Mines, N.L., leases and options in the Norseman district of Western
Australia for the purpose of developing them for production.
ihe original capital issue was 1,600,000 shares of 5/- each, from which 300 000
shares were allotted to Phoenix Mines, N.L., in full payment fo? properties

The DOCTOR AT LLOYD'S
Although most of the customs and traditions associated
with the early history of Lloyd’s of London have survived
until the present time, there is one notable exception—
the “Doctors” at Lloyd’s.
They were a special coterie of Underwriter-Broker, sought
after by their colleagues for re-insurance against a risk
becoming a total loss, such as when a vessel had become
a casualty or was considered overdue, as well as unusual
risks carrying heavy liabilities. However, with the advent
of steam and modern, fast means of communication with
the corresponding reduction in risks, they are fast becoming
a class that to-day is almost extinct.
★ This little thumb-nail sketch which, we hope, will be of
interest to you, is one of a series of personalities who were
prominent in the early days of historic Lloyd’s of London.
EDWARD LEMEE Y
A wealth of experience in all phases of Insurance, gained
through long association with Lloyd's, underlies the service
that we place at your disposal through our branches in
every State of the Commonwealth.

The year’s expenditure on re-
habilitation of the dredge and
plant, met out of the co.’s own
resources, was £20,528, and on
the mine £595. The mine figures
at £20,595, dredge £53,480,
plant £6826; total fixed assets
£80,901. Stores and spares are
in at £3988, and debtors and
cash total £73,001, of which
£62,965 was held in Australia.
War losses and rehabilitation
claims appear at £30,359. There
was only £470 coming to sundry
creditors.
The area now being dug con-
tains a further 2,587,000 c.y. of
average-grade ground, and there
are some 2,113,000 c.y. of
0.711 b. dirt in the adjacent and
recently ■ acquired racecourse
area. Altogether about 40
months’ work for the dredge is
thus measured up.
The immediate outlook is ob-
scured by Communist-inspired
disturbances, which the Malayan
Government is taking steps to
suppress. Also, the Government
imposed a 20 p.c. income tax on
profits from the beginning of
1948. The market prices the
scrip at 275. 6d., or thereabouts.
For the June quarter of 1948,
before the Communist trouble
flared up, tin-ore production in
Malaya was 14,711 tons (11,033
tons metallic tin) as against
12,849 tons (9637 tons metallic
tin) for the preceding quarter.
During the second quarter 42
more mines were rehabilitated,
bringing the total now operat-
ing in Malaya to 560. The In-
ternational Tin Study Group,
which met at Washington (U.S.)
in April last, revised its esti-
mate of world tin output, put-
ting the 1948 figure at 150,000
tons, 1949 at 170,000 tons, 1950
at 200,000 tons. Potential world
industrial consumption—if tin
were freely available —was esti-
mated at 190,000 tons for 1948,
and the same for the next two
years.

Great Boulder’s profit for
1947 is £834,956 (down £13,303).
The fall is due to higher work-
ing costs, following wage-lifts,
dearer supplies, labor shortage
and lower efficiency. The div.,
unchanged at 6d., less U.K. tax
of 9s. in £l, calls for £34,375.

Our Mess In Retrospect
Mr. Chifley has at last been
heard asking the trade-union
community, in a very polite way,
for more production. He has
not stressed the point that this
means greater output per man
per hour—the crux of the situa-
tion. Nor has he shown any
desire to deal with industrial
outlaws, or to make the Com-
munist wrecking-party illegal.
But the Prime Minister has
at least superficially acknow-
ledged a fact that was em-
phasised in these pages during
the government-by-regulation
years during the war, when few,
if any, other authorities saw
what was coming or cared to
talk about it if they did see it.
Years ago The Bulletin
spoke of the “spoiled children
of the war”—the trade-unionists
—dragging the country into what
it called a production depression
through bad government and
wanton trade-union leadership.
It emphasised the great inflation
that was taking place through
Budget mismanagement at a
time when Minister Lazzarini
described “inflation talk” as an
“attempt to stampede the Labor
people against the Government.”
This paper was a voice crying in
the wilderness at that time,
except for the support it received
from some members of the
Federal Opposition and the
Chambers of Commerce and
Manufactures.
Also foreseen was a state of
socialism being imposed upon
the people through taxation;
and it against such a state
achieved through such a means
that people are beginning to fight
now. The people are concerned
about the production depression
afflicting them, and are equally
alarmed at the socialist intent
behind the Canberra Govern-
ment’s taxation, banking and
general finance policy.
And yet the road “Labor” was
taking was plain enough for The
Bulletin to comment, when dis-
cussing Federal “Labor’s” first
year of war-time office;
Financially, 1942 was full of events
and effects. The money that makes
the industrial world go round was
shackled and fettered in every way,
and there are some who would go so
far as to say that Government regu-
lations in connection with finance and
industry, have been like the introduc-
tion of hard, square wheels where
round, pneumatic ones formerly
operated—and this not only in con-
nection with forms of finance, busi-
ness and industry which the authori-
ties desire to suppress but also in
connection with essential war-time
work and services.
There is something about
Bureaucracy that is absolutely foreign
to the individual Australian. It leaves
him speechless—or at least bereft of
words of a printable kind. Possibly
because he is essentially a resourceful
person himself he is all the more
dumbfounded by the frustration and
delay he encounters when he comes
up against Authority refusing to
accept Responsibility. That has been
all too frequently the tale in 1942 —
' departmental officers wielding the
whip over industry and individuals
but always passing the buck when
it comes to accepting an onus.
Departmental officers each day have
been granted more and more authority
over the individual. Very little private
initiative can be exercised in anything,
and our lives and our war effort be-
come increasingly subject to the pon-
derous effect of red-tape. It was
inevitable that a great deal of Aus-
tralians’ initiative would be taken
from them in order to get the country
on a total-war basis. Mobilisation
is the obvious answer to Axis mobili-
sation. But much of the administra-
tive side of this war effort falls short
of requirements. "There are too many
of the wrong people in the wrong
jobs. This is partly because the
present party in power finds it hard
to put aside in war-time its old belief
that government is a political game,
with spoils to the victors.
Published five and a half years
ago, it is reprinted to refresh
memories, and to remind that in
the next year—in 1943 —the
Curtin Government won a
smashing victory at the polls.
Having made a shambles of our
economic life, but still playing
the socialistic, game and frater-
nising with Communist “philo-
sophers,” Canberra and State
“Labor” is now out of favor in
every part of the Common-
wealth. But the Canberra crowd,
led by Mr. Chifley, won a post-
war election so short a time ago
as 1946.
We now know, economically,
what is wrong with the country.
There aren’t enough effort and
production in essential industries,
the trade-unions (under Com-
munist attack) are demoralised
industrially, the 40-hour week
has failed to bring a grateful re-
sponse from key unions. Gov-
ernments, Federal and State, are
taking too much money in taxa-
tion and at the same time
strangling private enterprise and
initiative. An excess of money
“But I have a first-class ticket !”
has been created, and too much
of it is under political control.
The Federal Government’s
“full-employment” policy has
nothing more imaginative or
constructive behind it than the
giving of a job on a Gov-
ernment payroll regardless of
whether the party so “em-
ployed” is doing a tap for
the betterment of the community
or simply eating his head off.
This gutless Government indus-
trial policy has produced a
breakdown in industrial dis-
cipline, especially in industries
deliberately white-anted by Com-
munist trade-union leaders.
Private enterprise has lost most
of its own powers of discipline
over labor owing to the mis-
chievous working of the Can-
berra “Government’s” high-
pressure political unemployment-
absorber.
We must now make a selec-
tion of what is good in the
social-security machinery that
has come to us in the past seven
years, take a lesson from the
good and bad effects of new
methods of credit-control that
have been practised in * this
country and other parts of the
world since war began, set about
making wage and other earn-
ings and savings become worth
their face-value by increasing the
productivity of the nation, re-
duce restrictive taxation, and re-
consider the question of the 40-
hour week. But before we can
expect anything of value to come
from the correction of individual
weaknesses and faults in ou|r
economic set-up we must cast
out the Communists from our
political and industrial life —
and before that is accomplished
it will mean settling the hash of
the socialist mob who have de-
graded the Federal seat of Gov-
ernment for several years too
long.
which is offering the public
800,000 £1 shares and has been
allocated $1,189,000 by Ex-
change Control for purchase of
plant. The vendor of the lime-
stone leases, now Metropolitan
Cement, Ltd., recently changed
its name from Metropolitan
Products, which was the name of
the co. formed by Arnold S.
Taylor away back in 1932.
It appears that the basis on
which the present flotation has
acquired an option over the
shares of the limestone co. is one
of an exchange of scrip at the
rate of 183 shares in the new
co. for each 100 in the old;
though there may be a cash
alternative.
According to information sup-
plied in an annual return filed
with the Sydney Registrar, in
January this year, Metropolitan
Cement (formerly “Products”),
the old co., had a paid capital
of £87,508, of which £87,000
was issued for consideration
other than effsh. It then had
only 35 shareholders. But 60
shareholders are named as
vendors in the prospectus of the
new float, and it would seem
that something like 118,000
shares are involved under the
option (at a cost of £215,713),
with perhaps another 15,000 or
20,000 still to be arranged fer-
tile prospectus says that the
scrip-purchase is on the basis of
£250,000 for the lot.
Those among the present 60
shareholders (in the old co.)
offering their scrip whose names
did not appear on the list of
shareholders in January this
year include R. G- Hamilton,
“Labor” M.L.A. for Namoi,
N.S.W. He has 2500 shares to
sell for £4583 (new shares or cash
not specified), and on latest docu-
ments filed was a director of
the old co. and is, on the board
of the new. A new shareholder
also is Arthur Vickery, director
of the new co., who doesn’t
appear as a vendor. Another
new shareholder is J. T. Walton,
chairman of the new float, who
is selling his 5000 shares for
£9166. Coal Holdings Pty. is
collecting £22,770 for a large
parcel of Metropolitan Cement
scrip not held by it for very
long ; and Arnold S. Taylor, who
owned shares totalling 3000 in
January, is down to receive
£72,964 for the scrip he is hold-
ing at present. How much is
new scrip and how much old
scrip transferred to him (if any)
is, like some other things, not
clear from the prospectus. A
big shareholder in the old
Metropolitan Cement Pty. in
January was Slaglirae Fertilisers,
Ltd., with 25,000 shares; con-
sideration named in the prospec-
tus of the new co. is £6508,
Another large holder was J.
Marron, with 17,501 shares.
Company taxation, which takes
11s. sd, in the £ in N.Z., doesn’t
leave much incentive for busi-
ness, said A. D. Bell, chairman
of the Farmers’ Trading Co.,
Ltd., M.L.’s largest merchan-
dising business, at the annual
meeting in Auckland. This co.,
with a turnover above £17,000
for every day it’s open for busi-
ness, or £4,294,772 for the latest
year (ended March), has been
pushing up sales to new peaks
annually for years past, but Bell
thinks the ceiling is near now, if
it hasn’t been reached. He asks
the Government to get busy with
the economy axe and not leave all
the pruning to private enterprise.

Dominion Money Policy
In a slashing attack on Labor’s
money policy in New Zealand,
Henry J. Kelliher, managing-
director of Dominion Breweries,
Ltd., and ex-director of the
Bank of New Zealand, said
that M.L.’s whole stabilisa-
tion policy was “in a state of
chaos.” He called for a “con-
structive effort” by all to lift in-
dustrial efficiency, “Unprece-
dented and continued expansion
of bank-created money,” still
going on, was at the root of all
M.L.’s economic and industrial
troubles, he said.
Money in circulation had been
more than trebled since 1939,
while consumer goods were
scarcer than before the war.
Bank demand - deposits had
reached £l4O million, against
£35 million in 1939, while fixed-
deposits rested round £39
million. The “tremendous dis-
parity” between demand- and
fixed-deposits showed that in-
terest on fixed-deposits was too
low to hold the balance even,
and that banks were finding it
more profitable to create and
lend new money. It was court-
ing suicide to continue this
credit expansion.
Apologists for the financial
set-up had made the excuse that
it had its beginning in paying
farmers for their produce in
N.Z. currency before money
paid by John Bull for butter,
cheese and meat was converted
into goods for the Dominion’s
needs, but this wasn’t supported
by figures which showed that
imports exceeded exports in
1947, when fresh credit of nearly
£2O million was pumped into
circulation.
Under present banking prac-
tice it was almost impossible for
trading banks to make advances,
buy securities or invest without
creating new money, but it was
preposterous to suggest that
there was no other course. What
the country needed was a dif-
ferent banking technique to
force trading banks to lend their
deposits—that is, use the ample
money already in existence, in
contrast to the Reserve Bank
policy of restricting overdrafts.
Credit-expansion policy should
be based on a stable costs posi-
tion.
World economic conditions
today were far more closely
linked with U.S.A. than ever
before, and were particularly
subject to abrupt swing-over
from boom to slump, almost
overnight, which was a feature
of American life. Deflation was
what M.L. had to guard against.
Until Labor’s money-expan-
sion policy began to take the bit
in its mouth in the early ’forties,
H. J. Kelliher was one of its
keenest supporters, while most
businessmen weren’t so sure.
Now that he has swung round to
bitter hostility, he’s rather hot
with impatience.
A New Cement Co.
British and N.Z. financiers
are jointly backing a scheme to
build big new cement works in
the Dominion at a cost of over
a million pounds ; and, because
coal shortages have hit the ce-
ment industry hard in late years,
they favor Westport, outlet for
M.L.’s richest coalfields, as the
site. Annual production of
100,000 tons of cement is the
aim. Finance Minister Nash put
his seal to the project early in
July when he signed import
licences for the plant.
The new co. is Modern
Cement Works, Ltd. Chairman
C. F. Schadick, of the provisional
directorate, reports that F. L.
Smidth, Ltd., London, which
ranks among the world’s leading
manufacturers of cement-making
plant, favors Westport as loca-
tion, on the strength of a survey
carried out on the spot early this
year by its engineer, A. Brix
Andersen, who found that all
the ‘materials needed were
within easy reach, and close to
railway access.
Tonnage of materials absorbed
annually will be double the
quantity of cement turned out.
Vast deposits of high-grade lime-
stone and marl will be quarried
at Cape Foulwind, midway
down the west coast of Nelson
Province, for railing to West-
port. An Empire development
group in U.K. is arranging for
half the capital, and a prominent
N.Z. financial group will under-
write the other half-million.
There is a hope that the plant
may be operating by the end of
1950.
Nationalised Hotels?
Brewery interests in New
Zealand are preparing to fight
to defend their right to manage
and control licensed premises,
as they see a threat that they
might be divorced by licensing
legislation from their lucrative
hotel trade. Chairman Len
Stevens, of Dominion Breweries,
Ltd., doesn’t think breweries will
be nationalised, but he’s worried
over the hotel outlook. “Con-
trary to public welfare,” he dubs
the move to nationalise hotels;
but the Licensing Commission
didn’t think so in 1946. The
commission was dead against
ownership of hotels by brewery
cos. or by hotel companies in-
terested in breweries, and laid it
down that operation of hotels by
licensee managers for breweries
created undue pressure to sell
liquor, which the commission
considered different from
ordinary commodities of trade
in that sales-expansion tended to
be detrimental to the public in-
terest.
Those in the trade and
others with knowledge of
sly-grogging say that only
moderate drinkers would be
content with less beer ; the more
determined would go the limit
to satisfy their thirst. Perhaps
the thorny nature of the problem
has been responsible for the two-
year delay in drafting legislation,
and there’s likely to be a ding-
dong tussle before the issue is
settled. Meanwhile, with the
Royal tour drawing nearer,
there’s a standstill in plans and
proposals to carry out badly-
needed improvements to Maori-
land hotels and build new
premises.
Iron and Steel
New Zealand has sunk deeper
into difficulty over iron and steel.
After a long struggle for best
grades, industry has been gripped
by control of black steel, and is
in a dismal mood. Harassed
engineering firms and building
contractors are told by Socialist
Ministers that pleas for bigger
supplies from Australia and
Britain have fallen on deaf, or
unresponsive, ears, and aren’t
given much hope. It’s the latest
stage in an uphill fight to keep
going as M.L. industries become
more “controlled” and shovel
into the bottom of the pile for
steel to keep wheels going. Ship-
ping bottlenecks are a headache,
too.
Key trades and factories have
been so long near the end of
their tether that they can think
only of tomorrow. But a ray of
light is seen in the move by one
of Britain’s manufacturers of in-
ternal-combustion engines—the
Bradford engineering co. of
Hepworth and Grandage, Ltd. —
to set up a £lOO,OOO factory in
Auckland for making motor-car
parts. There’s a big market if
the firm can get going, which
depends on steel and labor.
Early next year is the deadline
for swinging into production,
said William Hepworth, head of
the concern, on a visit to N.Z.
with the backing of “an in-
fluential group” of British
engineering cos.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Art and Craft.
The typical Loudon Sainthill
painting at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries shows a young man of
Semitic appearance Egyptian,
Hebrew, Persian —with a long,
melancholy, oblong nose and
large, round, melancholy eyes
dressed in a period or ballet cos-
tume.
One of the best is “The
Juggler,” whose lugubriousness
is offset by a warm reddish back-
ground and a costume decorated
with scroll-work. “Costume for
a Standard Bearer” exhibits the
dolorous one in rich, curiously
feathery armor against a back-
ground of scarlet. “Costume
for a Gala” makes a similar use
of color, and “Ornamented Cos-
tume for a Dancer,” in quieter
tones, would make an effective
design for pottery.
Along with these pleasing
decorations there are one or two
inferior samples: a “Dancer”
with no ankles and an abdomen
of splintered porcelain, an
“Eskimo” who looks like a
startled . golliwog ; and, especi-
ally, “Still Life in a Red Room”
where Sainthill has departed
from his conventions and, in an
arrangement like an Adrian
Feint but without Feint’s color
or technique, offers a few
blotchy flowers, a smeary pump-
kin and some indeterminate
blobs of paint which might be
apples, mandarins, persimmons
or balls of wool.
Except for this very inferior
work, the paintings have little
relation to life and, therefore, to
art in the high sense of the term ;
they lack the inner glow which,
whether in realism or fantasy, is
the vital essence. The lugubrious
young Semitic, who would not in
any case be very much alive, is
really no more than a peg to
hang the costumes on, and it is
in the costumes and the designs
that the interest lies. These are
works of craft rather than of
art; and, as such, admirable.
Though they may serve to
decorate a room as a jug does,
or a tapestry or carpet, they will
find their true relation to life
when they are painted on pot-
tery or worn by actors or
dancers.

At his print-room in Collins-
street, Melbourne, Joshua Mc-
Clelland has a show of pencil
and wash drawings and water-
colors by Louis Buvelot. They
are much more interesting than
the large gallery pictures which
gained the Swiss artist the
spurious title of the “father” of
Australian landscape painting. It
is doubtful if Buvelot ever
“saw” an Australian gum-tree.
What he saw was the prejudices
of his European education, and
he made them look like oaks
and pine-trees. It was not till a
few generations later that an
Australian painter saw a gum-
tree, and he was promptly ac-
cused of throwing mud at can-
vas, though all he had done was
to divest himself of the preju-
dices which Buvelot, among
others, had inculcated. But
Buvelot did have considerable
skill, if not enough to adjust
himself to his new subject-
matter, and it comes out most in
such light sketches as “Fisher-
men’s Bend” and “Dromana,”
painted about 1880.
Clive Douglas's
New Work.
That Clive Douglas has gone
ahead by leaps and bounds as a
composer in the larger musical
forms was apparent in his
“Symphonic Legend No. 2
Warra Wirrawaal,” given a first
performance by the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under
Eugene Goossens at the lown
Hall on Saturday. There are
periods of very fine orchestra-,
tion, with some particularly
effective, scoring for the brasses
—tuba apd trombones combine
to excellent advantage towards
the end. The whole work has
plenty of solid tone-color. Based
on an aboriginal legend, it com-
mences with an air of brooding
mystery, the mood changing
with the entry of the muted
strings. There is vigorous scor-
ing for full orchestra, followed
by some beautiful reflective
phrases.
Beatrice Tange was the soloist
in Cesar Franck’s Symphonic
Variations. The dialogue be-
tween piano and orchestra was
always clean-cut and sure, With
the pianist at her best in the
more florid of the variations,
where the orchestral accompani-
ment is confined to pizzicato
chords.
The orchestra seemed deter-
mined to put Tchaikowsky back
on the pedestal of high
musicianship from which Tin
Pan Alley had shaken him by its
theft of the theme introduced
by the oboe in the Second
Movement of his Fifth Sym-
phony, and which is churned
out execrably as “Save Me a
Dream.” This beautiful theme,
with the one immediately pre-
ceding it introduced by the horn.
was given its due in a splendid
reading. This andante cantabile
represents some of the finest
pages of the romantic mood in
all Tchaikowsky’s music, but
Goossens gave no hostages to
mere sentimentalism. His read-
ing was firm, and he patently
revelled in the opportunity to
prove that he is well on the road
to what he promised a year ago
—that within two years he
would mould the Sydney
Orchestra into one which could
be numbered among the six
finest in the world.
"The Alchemist."
It might possibly have been
better for this comedy of Ben
Jonson if the actors hadn’t been
so enthusiastically eager to
make the lines comic instead of
letting the comedy in the opus
speak for itself. Jonson’s play
about the menials whose master
has left his house for fear of the
plague and how they enter into
a compact to practise alchemy
and any other profitable form
of gulling has held its place as
a comic masterpiece on the stage
for 200 years, provided Garrick
with his best role and had music
written for it by Handel.
The play is a sort of 17th-
century “Doctor’s Dilemma.”
Practising alchemy was a re-
spectable profession in one
reign, in the next it was a felony,
and it was a fertile source of
income to one English sovereign.
It was the father of chemistry
according to “Golden Bough”
Frazer. Ben makes such a lovely
hash of its pretensions that it is
a pity he isn’t here to make a
similar mess of free-medicine
schemes and suchlike.
Apart from the tendency to
overact and mouth their lines to
the point of unintelligibiiity,’ the
Queen’s College players, especi-
ally Peter Thompson as a
lawyer’s clerk, Jim Lawler, and
George Hastings as a deacon,
made a fair fist of the produc-
tion.

The Kiwis came to Melbourne
Comedy 20 months ago expect-
ing a few weeks’ stand ; they are
still there playing to packed
houses on the threshold of their
third year of occupation, with
three changes of programme.
The 30 Maoriland ex-Diggers
share and share alike in the
profits which are the envy of
brother histrions, and the man
who blows the cornet gets the
same emoluments as the female
impersonator who brings the
house down. Every now and then
the accumulated surplus in the
bank is distributed as a bonus.
They work in terms of a consti-
tution framed by themselves in
which the rules and regulations
have been passed by the vote of
the majority and which adminis-
ters itself without friction. If a
Kiwi makes a belated entrance,
displays some deficiency in his
make-up or commits a more
serious offence against the Muse
he gets a chit with his screw
stating that he has been fined a
bob or a fiver, as the case may
be, and hears no more about it.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Paul Klecki waved his magic baton over
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and
brought forth inspired playing in
Stravinsky’s “Firebird” Suite. An exile
from his native Poland, the conductor
has made his home in Switzerland, his
wife’s country. Since the destruction of
the majority of his own 29 compositions
by the Germans Mr, Klecki has done
practically no creative work, but hopes to
be inspired to it while in Australia. Mrs.
John Chaldjian was one of the few
women who wore formal dress —her
gown of black tulle was worn under a
full-length ermine coat. With Dr. James
Godden was his wife. Hephzibah
Menuhin, snug in a mink coat, was
accompanied by husband, Lindsay
Nicholas. Pianist Viva Holgate Clarke
and Mrs. H. E. V. Richardson were
other appreciative listeners.
The annual Australian Sheepbreeders’
Show at Newmarket attracted many
country visitors. Casting an expert eye
over the Merino ewe which won for her
father, C. O. Fairbairn, a championship
ribbon was Mrs. Phillip Russell, of Beau-
fort, smart in a brown-and-blue-checked
suit and upturned hat of brown-and-white
felt. Margaret Russell, of Carngham,
watched her father, Alec Russell, judging
the Merinos. Beverley Kelynack, of Bun-
doora, spent a lot of time admiring the
prize-winning Corriedales of her uncle
and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Stewart,
of Monegetta. Mrs. Charles Mackinnon,
of Strathdownie, strolled among the
woolly aristos in a vieux-rose suit and a
beige hat trimmed with striped ribbons.
Kitty Synnott’s blue-and-white-checked
suit was worn with a white felt hat.
Alice Carse chose a henna-toned suit
and a brown hat which featured a white
scarf trimming. Mrs. R. G. Hutchins, of
Yerong Creek (N.S.W.), was tailored in
brown; her white hat was edged and
banded in matching brown.
Hats for spring will be high, wide and
handsome, and laden with flowers,
feathers or fruit. A preview of fashions
will be paraded at the Australia on
August 10, all proceeds going to the
Royal Melbourne Hospital’s Almoners
Auxiliary. Mrs. W. K. Burnside is presi-
dent of the committee. The hats are
the creations of Earnest Ransome and
the Du Barry gowns by clever Australian,
20-year-old Florence Raymond, Stripes
and spots will dazzle the eye this spring,
for both have been combined to make
dramatic patterns. A full skirt highlights
one navy-and-white-striped frock with
large navy coin-spots patterned on the
stripes. The slim-fitting bodice is of navy-
and-white stripes, minus the spots, but the
sleeves repeat the coin-spot-over-stripes
motif. Stripes are effectively introduced
into a cerise-and-grey taffeta evening
gown ; the stripes narrow and set close to-
gether on the decollete bodice, but widely
apart and broad on the skirt. Picking
up the oyster-grey of the stripes, long
trails of velvet roses are set at one side of
the bodice and skirt. Velvet will be
lavishly used in ballerina and evening
gowns with lace trimmings. For ex-
ample: the full skirt of a black velvet
ballerina frock features a bustle from
under which cascades white lace which
falls right to the hem of the skirt. As
gay as a summer morning is a day dress
for summer wear, fashioned of linen
spotted in red and white. Another is
striped like the old-time barber’s pole.
Shoulders will be revealed quite a lot;
also, the one shoulder-strap is definitely
“in.” One such gown in mulberry-toned
velvet with matching sequins stresses this
fashion, with the skirt slim-fitting and
slit at the front side-seam. The vogue for
linen, either plain, pastels or patterned,
will grow in popularity.
“Happy and Glorious” is one of the
brightest shows seen at the Tivoli for
some time. It stars Ben Blue, the
American comedian, and the recently-
returned Sylvia Kellaway. In the audi-
ence on opening night were Mr. and Mrs.
Marchant Penfold (she tucked her hair
into a bright-red velvet snood), accom-
panied by Mr. and Mrs, A. G. Hall,
who are visitors from India. Mrs. Wallace
Mitchell chose a black ensemble. Mrs.
Norman Spry’s black cloth coat had a
pale-beige fox collar. Dian Silk wore a
black frock and a Patou-pink bonnet
trimmed with bunches of black taffeta at
each side and tied under the chin. Gwen
Bruce, from Adelaide, added a lido-blue,
feathered off-the-face hat and silver-fox
cape to her black frock.
Only the imperious call of that hard
task-mistress the theatre broke up the
highly-successful press party given at the
Australia by the Ben Blues. The hostess
wore an off-the-shoulder cocktail frock
of brown and white wool in small checks,
the slim-fitting skirt having a side-drape
and finished with a fringing of the
material. Guests included Mrs. Frank
Martin, whose black hat clustered with
flowers was worn with a black suit; Mrs.
Locksley Shaw, in large off-the-face black
hat and black coat; Sylvia Kellaway, who
combined a flared-peplumed black velvet
jacket and black satin skirt; Kath Craw-
ford, who added to her black frock a
small hat fashioned of tartan ribbon ;
Trixie Johnson, in black cocktail frock
and coat with silver-fox collar ; and Mrs.
Garnet Carroll, whose black hat was
trimmed with sweeping burnt-amber
ospreys.
The cutting-edge of a midwinter wind
at the Moonee Valley meeting inspired
no sartorial thoughts other than those
pertaining to furs and tweeds, and plenty
of color was infused into some of the
ensembles. Lady Clarke wore with her
full-skirted frock of olive-green a
cinnamon-brown velvet coat and felt hat
to match the frock. Chpcolate-brown
was Mrs. W. K. Burnside’s color-choice
for her coat; her high-crowned hunter’s-
green felt hat was swathed in matching
velvet ribbon. Tulle niching in a rich
shade of blue embellished the hat worn
by English visitor Mrs. A. E. Davies with
her black Persian-lamb coat. Mrs. A. E.
Kimpton teamed an ermine coat with a
soft marine-blue felt hat. Her daughter,
Mrs. John Quere, wore a cornflower-blue
suit, ermine coat and a large. felt hat
finished with a bow of matching velvet
ribbon. A jacket of beige gaberdine
showing the longer line and slim-fitting
black skirt made attractive combination
for Mrs. Phillip Dare. Mrs. Alan Scott’s
brown tailored suit was worn with a
winter-white felt hat trimmed with strik-
ing yellow and brown feathers. A lynx-
fur collar was the feature ,of Mrs. James
Buchanan’s winter-white coat, which
was worn with a hyacinth-blue hat. Blue
and primrose feathers trimmed the small
black toque which topped Mrs. Fred
Hammond’s black suit. Mrs. Clive
Fenner’s gaily-striped taffeta hat was
worn with a grey squirrel coat. Brown
and fawn checks and a brown cloche hat
were Mrs. Bob Bailey’s choice. Pipings
of red lent distinction to Mrs. A. Silk’s
black-hooded coat.
Pictured here is Anne, younger
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. P. V. Gibbs,
of Mildura. After leaving Mildura High
School Anne went into her mother’s salon
to train as a beauty-culturist. She spent
a year in England with her sister Pat. At
the “Daily Mail’s” Ideal Homes Exhibi-
tion they were invited to demonstrate the
cold wave ; a new venture for English-
women. Anne plays tennis and golf, rides
and is also keen on amateur dramatic
work. She is now settled down again in
the Murrayside city. Photo, by Frank
Zaetta, Mildura,
At the late-afternoon party given by the
Philip Dares at the Australia for Mrs.
Margaret Saker, organiser of the 1948
Miss Australia Quest, the hostess wore a
black taffeta ballerina frock with a sequin-
spangled bertha collar. Matching gold
sequins were scattered over the snood of
black fisher-net attached to a bandeau
of black velvet ribbon. Mrs. Saker’s
tailored dressmaker suit had touches of
grey Indian lamb; her small lime-toned
felt hat sprouted pink and green feathers.
Mrs. F. Scherger wore a beige fox bolero
over her black frock; her black hat was
trimmed with feathers and ribbon. Mrs.
Harold Holt wore with her black fur-
trimmed coat a small beige taffeta hat
trimmed with matching feathers. Mrs.
Wallace Mitchell was with her co-director
on the board of the Quest, Mrs. Eric
Cottrell. Gwen Coleman added London-
tan accessories to her grey suit. A black
ensemble was Louise Read’s choice.
Mrs. George Vasey, whose vigorous
championship of war widows arouses
everyone’s admiration, combined grey
suit and black-ostrich-feathered hat. Mrs.
Harold Rabling’s hat also flaunted
plumes; silver-fox covered her black
frock. Pink feathers embellished the hat
Mrs. John Vincent wore with her dyed-
ermine coat.
From Sydney
Little children, millions of them,
hungry for food, starving for food, are
asking your help. Their cry for it is none
the less heartrending because it comes
from afar off. The children of Europe
need our help. This land of ours, still
smiling with plenty, has promised to
stand by the United Nations Appeal for
the Starving Children of Europe. Never
mind the exclamation of sorrow at their
plight. Dig into your handbag and give
a coin or two. Remember, an ounce of
help is worth a pound of pity.
The C.W.A. is giving the proceeds of
its International Day (Friday at the
Trocadero) to the appeal. Minister for
the Netherlands and Mrs, Teppema,
Netherlands Consul-General Zylstra and
his wife will attend, and the ladies will be
among the afternoon’s speakers. Mr.
Van de Laan, press attachd for the
Netherlands, will also speak. C.W.A.
International Day this year centres
around the Netherlands.
Up at Anthony Horderns’ on Brickfield
Hill the doors are thrown wide to
Spring. This is a very important spring
to the store, for the seasonal fashion
display coincides with the celebration of
the 125th anniversary of the famous store
which will be en fete from top to base-
ment throughout August. Clever artist
Elaine Haxton has designed gay and
alluring window and store displays. There
will be Anniversary specials in all depart-
ments ; special Anniversary menus and a
birthday-cake in the great restaurant.
Late on Monday afternoon the directors
of J. and N. Tait gave a party in the
Kent Room of the Australia to welcome
Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth, the
Firm’s two concert stars who lit the Town
Hall, last night, like a whole constella-
tion. Anne, who is famed in opera, film
and radio (as is husband Webster Booth),
has a soprano voice smooth as a mag-
nolia. She is very good-looking, as can
be seen from the accompanying photo-
graph, and she brings to the stage the
rare quality of living her songs. Anne
has pleased many and vast audiences in
the U.S., she has been billed as the
nightingale of the 8.8. C., and she and
Webster Booth are the Andre and Denise
of the British technicolor film “The
Laughing Lady. 5 ’ The next concert of
the season will be on Saturday in the
Town Hall.
Loudon Sainthill asked so many
people to the opening of his show
of paintings that the pictures were com-
pletely obscured. If you wanted to study
the fantasy, the harlequinade of life as
the artist views it, you went early and
did a quiet potter around the walls. Quite
a few of Loudon’s admirers had done
this, and the frames flashed a nice glow
of red discs in the cold dusk of the July
day. Indeed, the day was so chill that
brilliant little ballerina, Sally Gilmour,
who opened the show, could have been
excused if she had suddenly leaped from
lady into fox, and said her piece snugly
esconced in her foxskin. But no ; she
stood heroically in her black satin tunic
number. This was right up to the neck,
and was draped over the hips, thence
drawn to the back of the skirt, where it
fell to the hemline. Sally’s speech was
short and full of good wishes to the artist.
At the end Loudon, in the spirit of the
decor surrounding them, kissed her lightly
on the brow.
If you were a housewife, even if you
had one of the new pressure-cookers, a
glimpse of the artist’s “Housekeeper” re-
minded sharply that though the drinks
were good (this was an art with cocktails
opening) the time for the flow of gas was
restricted. This Housekeeper, by the way,
like the snail, carried her home on her
back. Her dress was all houses and
chimneys and roofs. Although the rooms
were crowded they were less like an
aviary than is usual these days. There
were fewer hats with feathers. Medal for
hardihood to artist Jocelyn Rickard for
wearing an off-the-shoulder frock. This
was of mignohette-grey taffeta. Laige
pearly-headed pins caught up Jocelyns
hair.
Mrs. Cedric O’Gorman Hughes wore
her arms bare from the tiny puff sleeves
of her green velvet frock. Nobody was
more effective than Mrs. Saurer, wife of
Switzerland’s Consul-General. Her slim-
fitting black top-coat had narrow panels
of black velvet. Rambert ballerina Mar-
garet Stott, just out of hospital, was very
pretty, her pale-gold hair and rose-petal
complexion set off by a beige and brown
late-aftemoon frock. Sidonie Goossens,
just arrived in Sydney, was there with
daddy Eugene. Phillipa, Keane was there,
and Barbara Knox, and Mrs. Bernard
Lowe, and Mrs. Alan Potter, and Mrs.
Neil Hutchinson, and a lady with fascin-
ating elbow-length green-and-gold satin
gloves.
Dress-designer Christian Dior has been
dreaming in the Luxembourg Gardens.
In the dream fair ladies move like ships
in full sail across a golden sea of
beeswaxed salon. In this dream strip-
tease, the night-club pocket-handkerchief
dance-floor, H.C.L. and tax-collector do
not intrude, but frocks of 14, 15, 60 and
80 yards have full swing. Towards the end
of the display of new Dior models at
David Jones’s last Saturday night the 900
onlookers weren’t even raising the eye-
brow when one girl modelling a frock
had such an embarrassment of riches that
she had to have a handmaiden to arrange
the folds of the material as she turned.
This display was well arranged in the
restaurant. The girls wearing the models
walked down the platforms—-rather like
pi ers —into the sea of humans. Seats
were arranged so that everybody had a
good view, and saw that shoulders (thank
,heavens!) are no longer padded, though
hiplines are ; that skirts are often stiffened
with buckram or hor'sehair; that even
those for daywear sweep or twirl like a
humming-top. Again, they come so
slimly-cut that only the flat and narrow
below the 20in, waistline dare wear them.
Hats are large, saucy, worn at the side
of the head and jabbed on with large-
headed hatpins, suggesting the gay
’nineties.
If you are a reflective girl you will
wonder if these styles are designed in this
post-war man-scarce age as bait for the
male, or if they are a sort of red herring
across the path of woman’s progress to-
wards place and power. Certainly no
woman determined to capture and keep
the 20in. waistline of the Dior decree
could concentrate on mere politics.
All Sydney’s fashionables were at the
opening. Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones, who,
with her husband, received the Minister
for France and Mrs. Auge, France’s
Consul-General de la Croix and his wife,
Sydney’s Lord Mayor Bartley and Mrs.
Bartley and other official guests, wore a
graceful and swaying frock of raisin-
brown moire inlet with velvet panels.
Food for Britain fund benefits by the
gala.
City Tattersall’s Club’s annual ball will
take place at the Trocadero on Tuesday,
August 31. This year the proceeds go to
help the Sacred Heart Hospice for the
Dying at Darlinghurst, and the Home
for Incurables at Ryde. This ball is now
a yearly feature, and each year since its
inception in 1929 the funds raised have
been given to some of the city’s deserving
charities. These have benefited to the
amount of £30,000.
An old bit of Sydney was recalled
during one .of the recent, art parties
when Mrs. Douglas Speed, out here
to get authentic background for
a novel concerning romantic and stirring
episodes of her own family, met Lady
Manning. Lady Manning recalled she
has been a pupil at the very exclusive
Young Ladies’ School run by Mrs.
Speed’s grandmother, Mrs. Gilder, first at
Elizabeth Bay House and later at
Merrioola. Mrs. Speed, who is English,
is on her first visit to Australia, and is
accompanied by her daughter Maria, now
studying art with Thea Proctor. Maria
looks forward to continuing her studies
at the Slade School when she returns to
England.
Right behind the whirling skirts of the
wild westerlies spring is creeping on the
land. The fashion designers know it, and
by September every one of us will be
longing for the right sort of frock to
greet the sunny day. A few hints on the
subject can be gleaned at Prince’s this
afternoon. A Fashion Festival to aid the
American-Australasian Ex-Servicemen’s
Memorial Club will present afternoon
and evening frocks and joyous beach
wear from three o’clock onwards. The
Lastex swimsuits, in all the tones of coral,
white, black and floral, will make direct
appeal. Robbi Robinson, Pat Akers,
Patty Haas, Betty Gardiner, Norma
Geneave, Diana Gregory and Geraldine
Pitt are among the girls displaying the
clothes; also Winifred Lucey, of New
York. The Henry Braddon lady is
president of the festival.

THE SERVICE MAN
Europe on the Edge.
“Ek Dum”: There is little
doubt but that relations between
Russia and the Western Powers
are going from bad to worse.
All three Western Powers
agreed to present an identical
aide-memoire to the U.S.S.R.
Foreign Minister. In the cir-
cumstances aide-memoire sounds
very like the translation of the
word “ultimatum.” Mr. Molo-
tov, with his usual sense of
propaganda values, arranged
that when the delegates arrived
to present it he should be on
holiday at his dacha, or country
house —every democrat-commis-
sar in Russia has a country
house provided by the State, just
as “Labor” Ministers in Can-
berra have provided themselves
with a luxurious holiday resort
at Jervis Bay, together with some
other lesser-known hang-outs.
From his hidey-hole he was
able to return with a maximum
of advertisement to hear what
was said. The details of the
Western Powers’ representations
have not yet been made public
at the moment of writing.
In Berlin the situation is
gradually deteriorating. There
is no sign of a weakening in the
Russian attitude. Their assump-
tion seems to be that they have
have taken over the whole Ber-
lin area —that the British, Ameri-
cans and French are only visi-
tors.
In Belgrade at the same time,
Vishinsky, the bloodthirsty
prosecutor of the Rusian purge
Courts, was at work destroying
the convention under which the
Danube was made a free water-
way for all nations in 1921 by
the peace agreement come to
after World War I.
The Danube does not, of
course, run through any part of
Russia, but the Russians are be-
having towards it with all the
assurance of complete owner-
ship.
Mr. Vishinsky told the inter-
national conference on naviga-
tion of the Danube which has
been sitting at Belgrade—a capi-
tal which is supposedly a plague
spot by Communist standards,
but very obviously isn’t in
reality—that the 1921 conven-
tion was no longer in force and
that if the Western Powers in-
sisted on conference decisions
being subject to the agreement
then made they would be thrown
out —“as the door was opened
for them to come here, so the
door will be opened for them to
leave.”
It seems that Russia has taken
command of the Danube en-
tirely.
The present state of affairs
cannot continue, because there
is no question of a status qiio
being established. So soon as
the Russians have acquired one
inch of concession by force or
negotiation from the West they
proceed to take another foot.
And the time is almost here
when they will have to be
stopped suddenly.
Then the world will find out
whether the U.S.S.R. is bluffing
or not.
Secrecy and Defence.
“Ek Dum”: So far as the
Government is concerned the
discussion on atomic Secrecy is
profitless.
Its attitude is its usual obstin-
ate one. Mr. Dedman says there
is no concealment by the United
States or anybody else. There
are no leakages. There is no
need for anybody to fear the
Communists —their influence is
“exaggerated” by 'the wicked
press. He has told people in the
States proudly that
there are no Communists in the
Australian Parliament ... a
matter about which some close
students have been in doubt.
He did not tell them that
the wharfies, the coalies, the
builders, the ironworkers and the
seamen, whose heads are officials
of the Communist party —again
and again in other countries
such Communists have been
proved to be officials of the
Soviet Union Foreign Office
—have only to lift their little
fingers and his Government
goes behind a tree and allows
them to carry on.
Much of the debate during the
week has centred round Sir
David Rivett, but it is not fair
to estimate his viewpoint from
daily newspaper reports of sen-
tences snatched from his mouth.
It is hard to believe that he is
correctly reported.
But a first principle of all ser-
vice is loyalty to the employers’
interests. If every employee held
that he was at liberty or bound
to bruit abroad the secrets of
the business which employed
him to all and sundry, including
deadly competitors, then life
would soon be chaos and com-
merce would be impossible.
There is a lot of squirming in
dealing with the matter by people
other than Mr. Chifley. Forty
scientists have written to the
daily papers saying that “the
history of science shows that
fundamental inquiry can flourish
only in an atmosphere of com-
plete freedom of discussion and
of exchange of information be-
tween fellow-workers.”
If that means anything it
means that science cannot
flourish unless its results are
given to anybody who wants
them. As the people who want
them most eagerly are Com-
munists, and every scientific
organisation of the Government
in every major Western country
has been deliberately riddled by
Communist spies for the purpose
of getting them, it would seem
that it cannot flourish without
secrets being handed over to
Russia.
If the axiom of the 40
scientists had been followed dur-
ing the war, there would be now
no C.S.I.R. It would be called
the W issenschaftlicheun ter sue h-
ungsbureau or something like
that, since British science was
ahead of the Germans on atom-
splitting and, if everything had
been handed over, the Germans
would have run parallel in scien-
tific results and an easy first in
determination to use the atom
bomb against civilian cities.
If the Russians were willing
to share their results it might be
a different matter. But they
have never shared anything.
They took everything the
Western world had to give in the
way of scientific knowledge dur-
ing the war —while honeycomb-
ing United States and British
departments, where possible, to
steal anything they were not
given. They would not let a
British or American observer,
scientific or otherwise, near their
battle-lines and particularly near
their guns.
Yet now a propaganda by
Russian agents—most of them
Australian or British nationals
who have turned Communist —-
shouts throughout the world
that science cannot progress in
an atmosphere of secrecy.
Radar, the atom-bomb and
jet-aircraft invention all con-
found this silly argument. And
reason confounds the contention
of Sir David Rivett that a vast
scientific organisation like the
C.5.1.R., which belongs to the
people of Australia, which deals
with plastics (so important to
aeroplane construction), metal
structure, and with biological
poisons, which may become a
vital weapon in the hands of un-
scrupulous nations, must be
allowed to spread its results
broadcast; and not only its own
results but the results which it
obtains from other peoples.
Mr. Chifley has rushed to the
aid of Sir David Rivett, and says
that “If it were not tragic it
would be comic to suggest that
a man like Sir David Rivett, who
has done such magnificent work
for the Commonwealth in the
C.S.I.R. and whose integrity,
honesty and loyalty are beyond
question, was party to some-
thing that is not in the best in-
terests of the Commonwealth.”
Nobody questions Sir David
Rivett’s honesty or loyalty. It is
his judgment and not his honesty
that is questioned.
It might be well to ask
Sir David Rivett whether he
believes it in the best interests
of the country that any con-
victed Communist, who has
been an agent of the ally of the
Germans during war-time and
who was caught red-handed
organising a spy system inside
civil defence, should work in a
Commonwealth Government re-
search institution dealing with
plywoods and resins. He should
be asked whether he considers
it in the best interests of science
to submit without protest to the
appointment as his colleague of
a defeated Labor politician who
has shown strong antipathies to
the policies of the British Com-
monwealth in war-time, and who
advocated more than once that
those policies should be jetti-,
soned in favor of Moscow poli-
cies.
Sir David, who is so strong
on the independence of scientists
and the need for them to speak
according to their consciences on
things which matter, has not
said nearly enough in the discus-
sion of personnel.
It has come out during the
week that C.S.I.R. scientists
and employees, including Com-
munists, have not even been
asked to take an oath of secrecy.
Yet Mr. Dedman has the inl-
“Me godfather! Will I look like HIM when I grow u p?”
pudence to suggest that the
dangers of the situation are over-
rated.
Does he know that the Com-
munist party is carrying on a
full-scale campaign against re-
cruiting for the Citizen Army?
Does he know that some of the
union leaders who will back him
at the next election are doing
everything possible by intimi-
dation and otherwise to prevent
young men qualifying themselves
to defend Australia?
If he doesn’t he should find
out, because when Parliament
meets he will probably have to
answer for his supine surrender
to these people.
Some Malayan History.
“Ek Dum”: Measures are now
being taken to round up the
terrorists in Malaya, and the
next few days should prove their
strength or weakness.
It is unlikely that they are
a large body.
The history of their organisa-
tion dates back to the war
period. They are the offspring
of bandit resistance-bands of
the Japanese day which were
welded together with the bribe
of arms and money by Com-
munist organisations—the “Mal-
ayan People’s Anti - Japanese
Army,” which wasn’t'Malayan,
being 95 per cent. Chinese, and
wasn’t an “army,” numbering
at its war peak about 5000
propagandists who fought very
little against the Japanese but a
good deal against “collabora-
tors” — i.e., locals opposed to
Communism or to paying tribute
to the bands —and the rival Kuo-
mintang “Army,” which bore
allegiance to Chungking, and
which numbered perhaps 400 or
500. The only Malay guerrillas
which operated were those
raised by Lieut.-Colonel Davis’s
Force 136. These, a small num-
ber, were commanded entirely
by British officers.
The “A.J.A.” —the Chinese
Communist show drew large
sums in gold from the British
at one stage in the war, but it
showed no allegiance to the Brit-
ish ; in fact, quite the contrary.
It issued a programme calling on
the Malays to “drive the Jap-
anese Fascists out of Malaya
and establish a Malayan repub-
lic.” It called on people to
do the usual things which Com-
munists ask for, including “to
combine with Russia and China
[meaning Communist China] to
support the struggles for inde-
pendence of the oppressed
nations of the Far East” —mean-
ing India, Malaya, and any
country under white rule.
When it was certain that the
Japanese would be beaten, and
when Japanese police arrange-
ments began to weaken, the
number of heroes in the Army
of Liberation doubled quickly,
and after the Japanese surrender
a high old time was organised.
The towns were decorated and
processions marched through tri-
umphal arches paying tribute to
everybody except the British, but
particularly to the Chinese
guerrillas, who presented a sleek
appearance in strange contrast to
the ghosts of Changi and the
Burma-road.
Their next move was a cam-
paign of revenge and suppression
against opposing elements. Any
Chinese who had refused to join
the Communist bands or to sub-
mit to their exactions became a
“collaborator,” and steps were
taken either to blackmail him or
to wipe him out. The “Army”
was changed into a “People’s
Democratic Union,” and of
course there was a counterpart
of the Eureka Youth Movement.
The British, trusting as usual,
had agreed to accept the A.J.A.
as a fighting force. And the
Communists, chuckling as usual
at the simplicity of democrats,
set to work to use their advan-
tages, to build up by threat and
blackmail labor organisations in
key industries through which
they could control the country.
In the end they found the
British tougher than they ex-
pected and the Malays not at
all interested in becoming sub-
jects of a Chinese slave State.
Feeling among Malays generally
was, and still is, remarkably
strong in favor .of the British.
The guerrillas were disbanded.
They were given a handsome
gratuity and relieved of what-
ever arms the Government could
lay its hands on. They were
nearly all youngsters of mainly
around the age of 20, and four
years’ indoctrinisation had left
most of them fanatical Commu-
nists who had actually been en-
couraged in their methods of
savage warfare by the people
whom it was their ultimate aim
to oust from Malaya.
They now began to organise
Malaya by their own methods,
which proved most ineffective.
One of the first results was the
descent of a large party of
Malays on Padang Lebar in
Negru Sembilan on November
6, 1945. The Malays wiped out
the village and all the Chinese
in it who could not get away
—the Chinese men who weren’t
absent ran, and the slaughtered
were nearly all women and
children. The Malays involved
admitted that they had run
amuck. They said they had
been driven to desperation by
the pressure and exactions of
the Chinese Communists, who
were trying to force them to join
the party and bleeding them into
starvation by threats and
violence.
After that there was an al-
most open war in some districts
between Malays and the Com-
munists, combined with Com-
munist-organised strikes and
violence in the cities —strikes
exactly in nature like those
which are carried on in Aus-
tralia under the management of
the Australian section of the
Communist party.
The first big hold-up was in
January, 1946, when workers
throughout the south were or-
ganised to carry out a stoppage
to bring about the release of
30 Chinese ruffians, ex-“ Comm-
unist Army” men, who had been
charged with murder and/or
possession of looted property,
together with three Indians who
were charged with bodily harm
to a civil servant.
The strong attitude of the
loyal Chinese and Malays killed
the strike in a few hours.
Since then there has been
nothing but trouble —sometimes
open and sometimes under the
■surface. But the background
has always been filled with
Communists—Chinese Commu-
nists. And the objective has
always been the replacement of
British rule by disguised Rus-
sian rule. The only strong in-
ternal support has been a rabble
support; the only external sup-
port has been Communist sup-
port.
The support in Australia has
been treachery to this country,
to the white race and to the
British Commonwealth.
Because of it, Mr. Chifley and
his feeble Government find
themselves able to send to
Malaya only such arms as they
can send by the R.A.A.F. and
the R.A.N. Their masters in the
Seamen’s Union deny them the
use of civilian shipping.
There was some talk last week
of interference with air-trans-
port of arms. If that should
come about the Government
will be put to a real test.

Way back in 1896, an expedition from Queensland found
sugar cane growing wild in the jungles of New Guinea.
In 1914 a special party of C.S.R. Co. scientists brought
back specimens of a high quality native cane. This cane
was crossed with strains from India, Barbados and
Mauritius. From this mixed pedigree a new champion
cane called “Trojan” was bred.
tons of sugar from an
acre of cane was consid-
ered a fair yield forty
years ago. Since then
scientific methods of farm-
ing and milling and im-
proved varieties of cane
have doubled the yield per
acre.

\
Sir Humphry Davy has been described as
being “almost, if not quite, unique as a truly great
natural philosopher who also secured a fervent
popular acclaim.” The miner’s safety lamp which
he invented, and for which he refused to take out
a patent, has saved many thousands of lives and
is still known as the “Davy Lamp.” He also
carried out work on the chemistry of tanning and
agriculture, but his most important researches were
on the application of electricity to chemical prob-
lems. Using electrolytic methods, he isolated
sodium and potassium, and he obtained compounds
of calcium, strontium and barium. His investiga-
tions of these reactions led him to suggest that
chemical affinity might be electrical in nature.
Modern science, nearly a century and a half later,
has shown that this is true.
Born in Cornwall in 1778, Davy was apprenticed
to an apothecary at the age of seventeen, but in
1798 his master released him to go to Bristol to
study the physiological effects of gases. Almost at
once he attracted attention by observing the anaes-
thetic powers of nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”),
and at the age of twenty-three the Royal Institution
appointed him Director of the Laboratory and
Assistant Lecturer in Chemistry. Such was his
success as a lecturer that he often attracted fashion-
able audiences of over a thousand, and in 1802 was
appointed Professor of Chemistry at the Institution.
So great were Davy's achievements that he was
made a baronet in recognition of his
great services to British science, as
well as being presented with a gold
medal by Napoleon in spite of the
fact that England and France were
at war at that time.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Apart from considerably improv-
ing the rather drab vista of winter
racing in Sydney, the Sydney Turf
Club’s £5OOO Cup, run at Rosehill
on Saturday, fittingly marked the
conclusion of the racing season, and
fittingly it was won by the best horse
of the season in Columnist, ridden
by the season’s premier jockey, J.
Thompson. The success brought
Columnist’s winnings for the season
to more than £22,000, beating Wind-
bag’s previous best-for-a-season of
£21,000.
Connections of the maiden Bluesaic,
and the slightly better-performed Beau
Felt, seemed a bit optimistic in fork-
ing up £3O a-piece to run their nags
in such a race, but these front run-
ners at least set a willing pace and
made a true staying test of the mile
and a half. The St. Leger-winner
Cronides had hit the front as they
entered the straight, but proved no
match for Columnist in the run to
the judg£; Cronides, however, beat
the rest, headed by Paktong, quite
easily. Columnist won by four lengths
and covered the journey in 2.30 J
against War Eagle’s course record
of 2.30 i.
Aside from the Cup, the most in-
teresting race on the card was a
seven-furlongs Quality Handicap for
two-year-olds, having their last run
as such. With the topweight, Rip-
tide, a non-starter the race was re-
garded as a match between Wattle,
the crack filly of the spring and
autumn racing, and the recent winter
“find” San Domenico (V. Faggotter).
Considering that San Domenico’s total
record (on paper) consisted of two
starts for two wins against second-
rate winter company, the handicapper
expressed an extraordinarily high
opinion in asking him to lump 9st.
and concede a pound to the Cham-
pagne Stakes winner Wattle. How-
ever, the Hua gelding more than jus-
tified the opinion.
Having her first run in four months,
and her first attempt at the seven-
furlongs trip. Wattle bounced out in
front and led to the straight entrance,
but thereafter it was all San
Domenico; he won by six lengths
in a canter —to all appearances a
freak galloper, and one out of the
box. Nessus was second, Grey Nurse
third and Wattle fourth. Though
he was easing up over the last half-
furlong, San Domenico clocked 1.25 i.
Times of older horses for the same
distance on the day emphasise the
excellence of this effort. Plausible
(A. Podmore) and Mortar (J. Thomp-
son), winners of divisions of the Parra-
matta Mixed Stakes, each took 1.27,
and the smart four-year-old Clipper
clocked 1.26 to win the Flying. Other
Rosehill winners were the promising
filly De La Salle (J. Thompson) in the
Three- and Four-year-old Handicap
(9f.) and Kerry Lad (W. Briscoe) in
the Welter of the same distance.
Among other things it was prize-
giving day at Rosehill, with Mr.
McKell doing the honors. The G.-G.
handed over the Cup, a cheque to
C. Cullen for training the Cup win-
ner, and prizes for the leading trainer
and jockey of the season —B. R.
Payten and J, Thompson respectively.

In Melbourne the season wound up
at Moonee Valley, where there was
keen interest in the struggle between
Badger and Purtell for the jockeys’
premiership. They started the day
with only a half-win between them,
and, in the course of the afternoon,
must have cost backers, particularly
the smaller punters, quite a packet;
most of their mounts were well-
backed, and unsuccessful.
Badger drew the first (and only)
blood when he won the mile Glen
Orla Handicap on favorite Rimfire,
which gave him the premiership. Over
the final half-mile Rimfire battled his
way from last to a narrow first,
downing Real Guy and Girl James.
Before he’d had much time to savor
the fruits of victory, Badger tasted
a little of the gall of the game; in
the following race, the first Sunset
Welter, his mount, Imperious, came
a cropper near the six-furlongs mark.
For a leading rider Badger seems to
take more than his share of spills.
Imperious had been favorite for
the race, and the subsequent winner
was really one for the bookies. Lara
Lad (D. Barclay), who had a run-
away win from Euxine and Cyclades,
paid £43 9s. 6d. for a win and
£5 14s. 6d. for a. place on the five-
bob tote. A total of 196 tickets were
held on the noble win-diwy.
Main event of the afternoon, with
the next big jumping double looming
close, was the well-endowed Hiskins
Steeple, which went to the veteran
Walladale (J. Taylor). Not surpris-
ingly, in view of his recent form, he
started at 33 to 1 and paid much
better on the tote. Favorite, The
Feline, led over the last jump but
was conceding the ancient one more
than 2st., and failed in the run home.
The Brunswick Hurdle saw another
upset when John Masefield (L.
Meenan) downed the 10-to-9 favorite
Latani.
Starting at 25 to 1 surprisingly
good odds against such a fair per-
former —Assam (G. Manson) downed
Viceroy (yet another favorite) in the
six-furlongs Derrimut Handicap.
Divisions of the Coo-ee Handicap
(Bf.) for two-year-olds went to
Ellerslie and Phoibus, a nice riding
double for W. Williamsori, who made
it a treble when he later won the
second Sunset Welter on Law Case.

America claimed a world record
for the Beau Pere/filly Honeymoon,
l.lli for seven furlongs. An English
galloper. First Edition 11, did the
trip in 1.20 more than 20 years ago.
Americans would say that First
Edition’s run was hand-clocked.
Hand-clocking, however, is just as
entitled to recognition as the Ameri-
can method whereby the clock is
started by the horses breaking a
photo.-electric beam after they have
travelled a short distance from the
start. Apart from doing a shade
less than the correct distance American
horses have the very considerable
advantage of being timed from a fly-
ing start. The Australian record,
put up by Freckles, is 1.22, which
would at least equal the American
time had it been clocked in the
American manner. At Randwick the
clock starts as the barrier goes up.

The Games:
As they stood listening to His
Majesty opening the 1948 Games, to
the Archbishop of York reading the
dedication and to Britain’s Group-
Captain Donald Finlay taking the
Olympic oath in a splendidly colorful
setting at Wembley Stadium, Aus-
tralian Merv. Woods and others who
had attended the last Games in 1936
in a Germany which was about to
plunge the world into years of the
misery of total war must have re-
flected on the especial appropriate-
ness of Britain as the site for the
first post-war Olympic Games.
Australia is one of the three coun-
tries which has been represented at
every modern Olympic Games, and
has a fine record in proportion to
its numbers. This year we sent our
largest team ever, and were quickly
rewarded with a win on the first
day when Westralian John Winter,
despite an injured back, cleared
6ft. 6in. in the high jump, a mark
which the usually outstanding Ameri-
can reps, were unable to equal—
fortunately, as it happened, for, with
that effort, Winter had done-in his
back completely.
The last Australian success in
Olympic athletics was credited to a
Winter who won the hop, step and
jump in Paris; not the same chap,
for that was in 1924 —many summers
have passed since the previous Winter.
Inspired by this early taste of
blood, other members of the team
made reasonably good showings in
their respective events, with the ex-
ception of the unfortunate water-polo
team. Apart from supplying from
their number a suitably statuesque
standard-bearer in Les McKay for
the march-past, the water-polo team
has done nothing to justify the ex-
pense of sending them; they were
washed out by the Italians and the
Yugos.
Sprinters Treloar, Curotta and
Bartram were all eliminated in semi-
finals of the 100-metres dash, the
final of which went to the American
negro H. Dillard, clocking 10.3 sec.
The closest Australia had gone to
another win at the time of writing
was in the long jump, where T. Bruce
was second in the final, covering
24ft. 9iin., the winner being W. S.
Steele (U.S.A.) with a jump of
25ft. Sin.

The fourth Test, concluded at Leeds
last week, was the best advertisement
first-class cricket has had in ages,
showing what can be made of the
game when, instead of playing for the
usual deadly draw, one captain throws
down a sporting challenge and the
other takes it up.
After batting through the fourth
day and piling up 362, England, at
the beginning of the final day, led

it squints."
by 403 runs and had a couple of
wickets in hand. Purely in order to
have the nomination of the roller,
Yardley let his chaps carry on for a
couple of overs, after first battering
the pitch with the heavy variety. He
then declared, setting Australia 404
to win in 345 minutes. For a while
it looked as though our chaps were
going to play for the draw, but,
with Hassett going early, Bradman
came in and, scoring off the first five
balls he received, removed all doubts
as to his intention; the necessary
was collected with 15 minutes to
spare. Bradman himself was still in
at the finish, having scored 173 and
completed a remarkable record of
a century in every match he has
played on the ground. Appropriately,
too, it was young Harvey who made
the winning hit —a four. Morris con-
tributed a knock of 182 to the win.
The 13th round of the Rugby
Union premiership on Saturday saw
Col. Windon play yet another rattling
fine game for Randwick, who beat
Parramatta 21-3, and lead now clearly
in the premiership. In other games
Manly downed Norths 32-14, Wests
beat Drummoyne 20-13, Eastern
Suburbs beat the wooden-spooners
Eastwood 19-6, and University
accounted for Gordon 11-8.

A stunned silence prevailed in
Collingwood (Melb.) over the week-
end, the local footballers, leading
“the four” in the V.F.L. competition,
having been toppled down at Geelong
in a fast and furious last quarter by
10.18 to 10.13. Across “the border,”
in Fitzroy, the silence was even
deeper, Fitzroy, having suffered the
shame of defeat by St. Kilda, which
hitherto had not won a game. It
was 1J.6 to 9.10 after Saints had
rattled on five goals in nearly as
many minutes. North Melbourne,
11.18, beat Hawthorn, 8.9. The other
six teams were debating the issue
when this went into the post.
*** ' ♦
One would have thought that con-
tinuous aggression throughout 12
rounds and the scoring of two
knockdowns would have earned
George Kapeen (9.10) a clear de-
cision in his match with Jackie
Wilson (9.6) at Leichhardt. However,
referee Mawson must have been very
impressed by Wilson’s more skilful
boxing, which might have been very
effective, too, had his opponent been
bound hand and foot to a corner-
post. It was called a draw.


ABORICGINALALITIES
“Bo”: The congregation in the little
galvanised-iron church at The Ridge had
just sat down after a hymn when Peterson
cocked an ear at the unmistakable growl
outside of Terry, his pugnacious Airedale-
foxy cross. Peterson knew the portents
of a growl in that particular key—stoush.
Came another growl, which he recog-
nised as belonging to Pickering’s half-
Irish terrier. The growls intermingled,
followed by snarls and whines, and
suddenly battle was joined. The parson
raised his voice so that his reading
of the weekly notices could be heard.
Peterson, on the aisle, slipped out
quietly, and he was immediately followed
by Pickering. By this time the fight was
in full fury, and within a minute the only
male left in the kirk w's the parson.
Shortly afterwards there came a gurgling
sound followed by a thud as of boot on
flesh, and yelps which receded into the
distance. Half a minute later the men
trooped back into the church and re-
sumed their pews. All looked rather
solemn except Peterson, who was grinning
widely. A few minutes later Brother
McClelland, coming around with the
collection-plate, paused beside Peterson.
The owner of the pugnacious tyke sat
back, grinned and jerked his thumb in the
direction of Pickering’s pew. “Ben’ll
shout for me,” he said. “His dorg lost,
an’ that was the bet!”
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: For 20 years I’ve
been harboring a delusion. It began
when, heartily fed-up with a city’s method
of handling a depression, Bill the Goose
and I strode out over the Perth causeway
and up through Guildford and Midland
into the fresh air of the ranges. It was
late summer and we travelled light—a
blanket each, a billy, frying-pan, some
tea and sugar. We weren’t hampered by
any excessive weight in our hip-pockets
either, and in the back of our minds was
the knowledge that, some time soon, we’d
have to find work. As we got up into the
wheatbelt the days grew shorter and the
nights longer, and we sought means of
keeping warm. An odd bag, purloined,
borrowed or accepted, soon added up to
a “Wagga”—bran-bags sewn together—
and we became choosey about sleeping-
places. While we stuck to the railway we
camped in goods-sheds or wheatstacks.
Further out we picked haystacks. They
make a wonderful bed, if you can disre-
gard the burrs ajid thistles, and a few
sheaves correctly placed will shed the rain
completely. We “did” the big State,
from Albany to the Murchison, for four
years, with more downs than ups, but I
don’t recall that we ever lost a night’s
sleep through cold or rain. I’d thought
we’d done well, considering. But now it
seems (B. 30/6/’4B) that we should have
gone around moving cows for camping-
sites or (B. 7/7/’4B) carried “something
to keep the body-heat from spreading into
the ground.” I came out of the last de-
presh with my head up. With this added
knowledge, I should emerge from the
next one a rich man.
* * * *
“E. 2”; Alec was interestedly watching
Booby, the prize old draught that Mullins
used for hauling wood, when the horse
got to standing about near the haystacks
and now and then stamping a hoof furi-
ously on the ground. “list as if he got a
sudden attack o’ the stutters in one leg,”
he remarked. “What do y’ reckon might
be the matter with him?” “Greasy heels,”
Mullins said. “He gits it ev’ry year when
the ground’s boggy.” Next morning Alec
was given instructions to bring in a load
of posts with Booby in the dray. On
his non-appearance by dinner-time
Mullins went to investigate. He found
Alec busily shovelling gravel on to the
slight incline of the track. “What’s that
for?” Mullins asked. “Well, y’ told me
t’ take good care o’ the dray,” Alec
backed up vigorously. “Y’ve got t’ think
of Booby, too. Goin’ up was all right,
’cause he had his toes well dug in. But
cornin’ down, with them greasy heels
likely t’ slip from under him, he had t’
have somethin’ t’ grip on or he might’ve
come down suddenly an’ snapped them
dray-shafts like carrots,”
* * * *
“Alpine Willie”: “Phwee —tchi—tchu-
tchu! ” The longdrawn swish of a
whiplash, the explosive crack and its
falling echoes come from the depths of
the gully, where silver wattles, tree-ferns,
bracken and shrubby growth make for
concealment. Careful stalking may bring
a fleeting glimpse of the performer. The
coachwhip-bird is rather smaller than the
common grey thrush, olive-green on the
back and light-grey beneath, has a black-
and-white topknot, black throat markings
and longish tail. The hidden song may
be repeated at short intervals for an hour
at a stretch. Coachie in his native haunts
is not so shy and secretive that he can’t
be watched and observed. But it’s almost
always in or on the fringes of the scrub
thickets that he’s found, oftep with his
mate. Watching a pair of them, in the
frozen pose that serves well to observe
in the bush, their quiet scolding soon
ceases and they condescend to go on feed-
ing on the insects they find in the litter of
"Good! I didn't think We could make it."
dead leqves and bark. The famed whip-
crack is a work of art. Coachie gradually
extends his neck to the rising cadence of
the swing, jerks the head forward sud-
denly for the crack and fades out his piece
with the echoes sotto voce. The lyrebird
mimics perfectly ;* better equipped vocally,
Menura manages with less physical effort.
It’s hard to credit tales handed down of
bush-folk being deceived in the coming
of the coach when coachwhip-birds were
calling. The call is not an imitation of a
cracking whip, but birdsong clear and
ringing. It is, of course, the similarity of
sequence and inflection that draws the
likeness, by accident an artistic interpre-
tation of the departed coachman’s swing-
ing whip.
* * * *
“Reims”: Some leading Australian
apiarists, amazed at the honey-flow of
the sou’-Westralian forests, estimate that
all the bees in Australia, working over-
time, couldn’t gather more than half of
the honey available in one corner of the
State, Anyone who has seen the karri
forests in bloom will agree. But that
honey-flow is native to the country. It
was, conceivably, greater before the
advent of the white man and his axe.
And since nature, although wasteful, is
not entirely prodigal, it was garnered by
the insects of that time. There are ants,
and some lesser-known ins|gts, that sup
direct from the flower ; but practically all
of that wonderful flow would have been
gathered by bees. Yet in 40 years of
keen observation of the bush I have never
seen a native beehive. Why? Has the
imported bee ousted his “black” brother?
Or has man ups?,t the balance of nature
by introducing some plague against which
the native bee was defenceless?
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Even the
wildest of Merinos becomes tame in
times of drought. On Tammit (mid-
Murray) during one cold, dry winter we
prematurely shore a mob of wethers
from a back paddock where they saw
only an occasional horseman. Then we
turned them out to take their chance on
the bare frontage country. On frosty
nights there the poor brutes, in seeking
warmth, used to barge into the tents of
two men cutting river-steamer wood, and
they couldn’t keep the intruders out until
they barricaded off their establishment
with logs. Then at meal-times the men
began tossing over the fence crusts, peel-
ings and even damper to the waiting jum-
bucks, with the result that soon the
cutter-cnm-cook daren’t call or ring a
cowbell to call in his mate for meals
for fear of bringing in 500 bleating, dust-
disturbing wethers as well. When the
sheep began following and watching the
cutters felling the two had to shift to
an adjoining paddock.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: The first time I ever went
to Euston on the Murray was in company
with Jimmy Beggs, and James was turn-
ing his camp upside-down when 1 arrived
to pick him up. He greeted me shortly
and invited me to load into the sulky
sundry rabbitskins and water-rat pelts, a
bucket of wild-duck eggs and a .32 rifle
with a bullet jammed in the barrel. This
done, I looked in on him, impatient to be
gone. He was still searching. “Can’t
find me collar,” he complained. I’d never
visualised Jimmy in a collar, but as he
refused to budge without it I joined
the search and located a grimy
celluloid neck-wrap under the front step.
“Hop in; won’t be long,” he announced.
A few minutes later we were bowling
along, Jimmy’s neck encircled in a 2in.-
deep celluloid fence, but minus a tie. Sar-
torial oddities were accepted without
comment jn that place and age, and I
thought no more of it until, within 20
minutes of reaching the town, I encoun-
tered him in Medley’s bar without the
collar. “Silly old goat,” I thought. “After
wastin’ all that time lookin for it an’
cleanin’ it, too.” I went off with the
younger fry, leaving him with a couple of
cronies. About midnight I found him,
poured him into the sulky, then drove to
the store verandah, where our goods were
neatly stacked. Bang on top of them was
the collar, pale in the moonlight. I
loaded the stuff and chucked it in amongst
the load. At the Ki Downs gate he
awoke, looked around, and asked, “Me
collar in?” “Yair,” I grunted. He fell
asleep again and was more or less asleep
when I unloaded him and the goods and
turned the horse loose. First thing he
sought next morning was the collar.
Written on it in his own crude hand was
the list of goods he’d bought, and against
each item the storekeeper had written the
price, with the total at the end. “Saves
lookin’ for bits o’ paper,” remarked
Jimmy. “Next time Igo in I’ll give him
the cash an’ the collar with another list,
an’ there she is.”

“Strewth”: Psychologists have now
come to the conclusion that those birds
and animals which “freeze” into immo-
bility on the approach of danger and are
protected by their neutral camouflage
coloring are not being so smart after all.
The I.Q, men claim they are incapable
of any other action. All animals have
instincts either to fight or flee when
ordinarily alarmed, but when danger
looms in a particularly terrifying form
and circumstances make these limited
courses obviously inadequate paralysis
takes place and movement is impossible.
However, don’t look down on the timid
little blighters with too much contempt,
for the allegedly nobler species, includ-
ing Homo sapiens, react in the same way.
Ever see a “Labor” Minister suddenly
confronted by a Commo union-leader?
* * * *
“Challenger”: The main obstacle
against getting one of those ocean dredge-
nets to the bottom (B. 9/6/’4B) is the
pressure of the current on the superficial
area of the line used for towing. Nothing
under half-inch steel wire is of any use ;
thus, when miles of line have been paid
out, the amo jnt of surface that it presents
to the thrust of a cqrrent is considerable,
and the weighted dredge is towed along
behind the ship at an oblique tangent.
Weight and area of wire-ropes and
chains operate in other odd ways.
In haulage from a shaft thousands
of feet deep it is not the actual load that
necessitates an increased lifting-power as
the shaft deepens, but the weight of the
rope, which increases the strain on the
winding-engine for every 100 ft. paid out.
Similarly, with a ship at anchor the
“pick” itself does only a minor part of
the holding: it is the weight of many
fathoms of chain-cable lying along the
sea-bed that keeps the ship from drifting.
In times of stress, when the anchor begins
to drag, the paying-out of another 100
fathoms or so of chain will often stop the
drag.
* * * *
“Bamekaw”: The extensive Bame-
kaw poultryfarm . (six fowls in the
corner of the backyard) having fallen be-
hind in egg productivity, the head of the
dowager of the flock came off. Mrs. 8.,
cleaning her for the pot, called my atten-
tion to what she feared was a growth on
the abdomen. Preliminary investigation
showed a lump, smooth and flatfish and
oval directly beneath the skin. Dissec-
tion revealed a pumpkin seed. It could
hardly have worked in through a break
in the skin —anyway, there was no scar.
But if it was swallowed how could it
have worked its way from the crop
through the tissues to a remoter part of
the body?
* * * *
“Ex-Bluenose”; Attributing the mys-
terious loss of such ill-fated ships as the
Waratah to topdieaviness is generally
hooey. What most likely happens is that
during a heavy storm, with the propeller
lifting and racing, they either lose the
screw or suffer an engine breakdown.
Then, not having a sea-anchor ready, they
broach-to and go down. That was at one
time a common fate of sailing-ships.
Frank Bullen in his autobiography tells of
seeing such a disaster overtake a brig in
the North Atlantic ; broached-to in the
trough of two tremendous waves, it sank
before the eyes of those on Bullen’s ship.
A similar disaster, on a smaller scale, is
still remembered at Fremantle: the Gem,
homing from the nor’-west and visible to
watchers on Arthur’s Head, vanished
within a few seconds.

“The Pirate”: There’s no doubt about
the hardness and durability of New
South Wales ironbark. Up the Hawkes-
bury Valley recently I inspected an 80-
year-old homestead built of it through-
out. It was walled with upright, half-
rounded slabs, squared on the edges, and,
unpainted and exposed to the weather,
the timber was as solid everywhere as
the day it was felled. Before the war,
too, I watched shipwrights at Williams-
town (Vic.) trying to bore the kelson of
the ketch Ripple to put in an engine-bed.
It was so hard that no augers or drills
would look at it. That vessel was built
on the Hawkesbury in 1872 of the same
timber.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: By the toughness of his
talk Nugget, the new fellow, would have
taken delight in running a Belsen horror
camp, so his prompt adoption of the stray
pup that somebody dumped in the truck
as it stood outside the store caused
surprise. However, he quickly dispelled
any suggestion of humane reasons with:
“Looks to be the makin’s of a fairly in-
telligent mong; a man should get a few
bob for him when he’s trained a bit and
got the silliness kicked out of him.” The
blankets were snug and warm when a
series of whining yelps floated up from
the shed. After about five minutes of it
Nugget roared in a voice that woke those
who weren’t already cursing silently:
“Shut up, you mong, or I’ll come down
and kick your ribs in! ” The cries merely
became louder and more entreating.
Three times Nugget bellowed his threat
before, cursing venomously, he strode to
the door and flung a long billet of fire-
wood in the general direction of the
canine lament. Silence fell —until the
shivering man had pulled the blankets up
around his wide shoulders; then the
sleep-wrecking row started again. Seven
roars later Nugget sprang out of bed,
dashed to the door and raced out into the
night like a madman. His curse-punctuated
vow to “silence him for keeps” had
scarcely died in the darkness when a
clatter of kero-tin buckets told of an un-
happy digression from the path. Instantly
the farm’s three mongs joined in the din.
Three distinct bangs suggested that three
tins had been hurled wrathfully to three
points. Another clatter indicated a
stumble over a stack of firewood. A few
seconds later a sharp yelp reached the
hut. Then —silence. “He has killed him/
Tommy whispered in a shocked voice.
Nobody answered, but long after the
shivering, cursing Nugget had crawled
back into bed we lay listening—and hop-
ing. In the morning, before Nugget was
awake, we found the little body—curled
up in snug slumber in the hollow of the
self-labelled sadist’s armpit.
WINTER AT DALBY.
The road is hard and black across the Downs,
And two and two —or four —like t oads to count
The starlings sit along the wire and feel
Through small clenched claws the singing-
ringing hum
And everlasting talk of telephones.
Along the fence all desolate and brown
The roly-polys stand in stiff straight rows
Like aged dowagers around a wall,
Still willing but not asked again to dance.
The wind in wild gavotte once whirled with
them
To east or west across a broad black floor
In brief and crazy summer revelry.
Astray, a gaunt and dusty wether crops
At short green wheat; a hurried furtive thief.
Beside us runs a friendly railway line;
Not fenced away, it turns and bends with us
To yarn awhile along the way to Bell.
The farmer’s house, his stack, his dump of
wheat,
The posts and trees that edge his boundary
All float and shimmer in a pale mirage.
How dry the grass!—like honey creaming down
To coat the yellow hills, and pouring deep
About the cold grey gums along the creek.
Wine-purple, blue and grey the Bunyas sleep,
Mystery beckoning beyond the Downs.

“Mat’s Mate”; The pair of us came
down from the Wamboota country to
Echuca one Sunday morning, put our
horses and dogs in the backyard of a pub,
ourselves into the bathroom and subse-
quently into clean clothes and the dining-
room, eager for refreshment. We’d
hardly seated ourselves when in sailed an
expensively-dressed and imperious lady,,
who sat at an obviously-reserved table,
dismissed us with one sweeping glance,
then gave her attention to coddling the
pet poodle which had trotted in with
her. She put the imitation tyke on a chair
and began to croon to it and feed it tit-
bits. Mat eyed this phenomenon coldly,
arose, went out and presently returned
leading Spieler, our dusty, disreputable,
suspicious and callous heeler. Mat’s in-
tention was to sit Spieler on a chair —
that being his idea of humor—but Spieler
took on? look at the poodle, jerked the
chain from Mat’s hand and set out to do
murder. The poodle screamed and rushed
under its mistress’s chair. Spieler would
have rushed under there, too, only Mat
crowned him with a water-flagon, grabbed
him by the scruff of the neck, hung on
and howled at the lady, “Get that insect
out o’ here an’ be ruddy quick about it.”
The upshot was a peremptory order from
the publican to get ourselves, our nags
and dogs out of there. We ate in a Greek
cafe, Mat remarking that “that flamin’
Spieler ain’t fit for respectable com-
pany.”

“Trade Wind”: Some idea of the im-
mensity of the job ahead of our survey
service in sounding vast uncharted dis-
tances of our coastline can be culled from
surveying sloop Barcoo’s programme this
year. She left last week for the n.-w.
coast, and will complete surveys of Port
Nelson, north of Yampi Sound, and
Rob Roy Reefs near by and an area be-
tween Jamieson Reef and Beagle Bank.
The whole area surveyed, feeling almost
every yard of the bottom with sonic
fingers, will be only a few square miles.
Yet it will take Barcoo till next Novem-
ber to do it. Before the war it was esti-
mated there was 100 years’ surveying to
be done around Australia. With the in-
valuable experience our survey-ships
gained charting MacArthur’s invasion
harbors, the Hydrographic Department
hopes to reduce that period to 25 years.

“Bughouse”: Tell “Kelms” (B.
7 1 7 1 ’4B) that science has given an answer
to the query whether an iron ship,
foundered over one of the great ocean
“A bit nippy this morning, Parkinson."
deeps—in the Pacific 34,218 ft., the
Atlantic 28,200 ft.—ever sinks to the bot-
tom. It is this: even at such depths
water doesn’t attain to anything like the
density or weight of iron, and therefore
iron will sink through it. It is considered,
however, that as it descends the hollow
parts of»a ship are crushed in until all
is practically flat. This process is seen
in its beginning when a submarine
descends below its safety-depth and water
starts to spurt in around rivets, bolts,
etc. As to the strength of currents, these
may be so terrific that the strongest ship,
sunk in comparatively shallow water,
may be torn to pieces. This happened to
H.M.S. Audacious, sunk off the north
of Scotland in 1915 carrying a cargo of
bullion. Salvage divers sent down only
a few months later found the ship
literally collapsing, huge sheets of steel
plate swaying in the current like so
many gigantic shutters. By the time
salvage was completed—only part of the
bullion was recovered —the whole ship
had become little more than a pile of
steel plate on the seabed.

“Dusty Mile”; The brolga’s com-
placency (B. 7/7/’4B) is‘based on sound
confidence in its speed and a lack of
acquaintance with city “sports” brandish-
ing guns. This confidence often makes
it a nuisance about camps and houses.
Householders have found their overtures
to the ungainly creatures readily ac-
cepted, and have consequently been
harassed by having them scavenge around
the back steps and raucously trumpet
their protests if their benefactor is late
arising from his slumbers. Incidentally,
the great bird is a true crane, the only
one in Australia, though the name is
often erroneously applied to some native
herons.

“Kelms”: Of" all the gastronomic
oddities with which civilised stomachs
are assailed, turtle soup is the most over-
rated. It has a flavor strongly reminis-
cent of boiled water, and may actually
be a blue-ribbon conspiracy to introduce
boiled water into a repast where in any
other guise it would arouse comment. Was
once interested in a purely local attempt
to introduce the viand to the public
palate. We didn’t cause a great number
of casualties amongst the shellbacks,
and when we went into liquidation—we
were in the soup —a heap of beef-bones
near the factory originated the rumor
that our turtle, a tame one, was released
after each swim around the pot. The
venture failed because of an underlying
trait in human nature. There is a type of
intellectual to which you can sell an idea,
like turtle soup or planned economy.
But the great bulk of humanity demand
the goods. And that great majority can
make or break alike turtle-soup factories
and spurious creeds.

“The Rabbiter”; Lyrebirds in the bush
aren’t usually friendly, but the experience
of W. O’Donohue, a council employee in
the Dandenongs outside Melbourne, is
otherwise. Recently when clearing a
tourist-track through the forest from
Monbulk to Kallista the birds followed,
sometimes only a few feet away, scratch-
ing behind him. For days as he moved
along the track the birds came in his wake
tearing the pathway walls down. But the
lone toiler cheerfully put up with it for
the sake of having such unusual rubber-
necks.

“Eastern”: Overtook Lofty mooching
through his paddock, and tagged along
for a bit. Lofty’s rabbiters were fanned
out on the left, the runners scattered
nicely, watching the hunters working
more or less industriously. Presently, I
spotted the lone little tyke nosing along
on our other side. “This your sheep-
dog?” I inquired. Lofty looked round,
“Aw, that’s Joe. No, he’s no good on
sheep,” he answered. “Cattle?” “Gripes,
no.” “Why doesn’t he work with the
pack then?” I asked. “Has he ever
caught anything?” Lofty shook his
head. “No,” he slid. “Don’t think he’s,
over caught a thing in his life. Joe—aw —-
he just pokes along.” Five minutes
further on there came a sudden “Woo —
woo! ” on our right, and I turned to find
Joe squatted, looking at the sky, and air-
ing his solo at short intervals. At once
the pack came hurtling, the first hunter
on the scene dashing into a clump of
tussocks and starting a rabbit out to the
"Gad! Takes me back to the good ole Poona days.”
waiting runners. Joe immediately lost
interest, and wandered off. I watched him
roam, apparently aimlessly, around
stumps and reed patches. Then he shoved
his nose into the end of a small log,
backed off till he was several yards distant,
and, flopping down, his “Woo —woo!”
again summoned the pack. We quickly
reached the spot and I looked round, but
already Joe was some distance away still
“just poking along.”
* * * *
“Zake”: The lugubrious-looking little
man with the dusty dog at his heels
shuffled into the pub, and in a hopeless
sort of voice asked for two pints. When
the pair of “collars” were delivered he
took off his battered hat, upended it on
the bar floor and into it poured one of
the pints, which the tyke promptly lashed
into. Then with a mournful look, and as
everyone else in the bar grinned broadly
at the spectacle of the hound avidly and
with great enjoyment licking the froth
from its whiskers, the dispenser of un-
usual canine cheer did the right thing
with his own pint. Then came a brassy
voice. “Wot’s up with y’, Sawny—y’ look
as if y’ lorst a quid an’ found a summons
—why don’t y’ look as cheerful as your
dog?” The lugubrious one looked even
more dejected. “Well,” he snarled. “You
wouldn’t look so cheerful y’rself if y’
knew you was goin’ to git a cold in the
’ead like I will. I always do after I put
a wet ’at on me scone after givin’ that
thirsty flamin’ cow a pint o’ suds! ”

“Lower Tops’l”: The bleakest resi-
dential area in Victoria these winter days
must be Cliffy, a small, rockbound, 150 ft.
high island 11 miles east of Wilson’s
Promontory. “On top,” where stand a
lighthouse and the dwellings of three
’keepers, is barely an acre in area and
devoid of soil. The island’s animal life
is confined to a few rabbits eking out a
meagre existence on the cliffside; the
only birds are redbills (black oyster-
catchers) which haunt the rockbound
precipitous shore, -The only diversions
are passing steamers and the arrival —
weather permitting—of the fortnightly
mail from Port Albert carried by the 67-
year-old fisherman George Smith.

“Bardie”: “The ghostses ain’t thick
’ere like they useter be,” remarked old
Harry one night in the Haunted Creek
hut. “They were in mobs once, pullin’
up where the old shanty got burnt down
an’ downin’ their grog like they was
enjoyin’ it. They ain’t so scarin’ when
there’s a crowd of ’em as single ones.
The worst turn I ever had was the night

an’ tryin’ out his ideas carefully, so I
was surprised t’ find him supportin’ a
ghost. ‘Cripes,’ I ses t’ Charlie’s ghost.

the shadder. ‘But I gotter keep up t’

fore it gits down t’ serious bizness.’ ”

“Solitude”: There’s the drover who
regulates his day’s span by the distance
between pubs, the bloke who trundles a
jinker of gear for night-camping, and the
thin-skin who packs even a tent-fly. With
a log burning, everything available, in-
cluding the bag from under the saddle,
wrapped round, and a tussock to shove
my head on, I thankfully call it a day ,
but not so the old bloke. Seventyhver
declares there “ain’t no sense droppm
down like a bullick, when a man c n have
all the comfort in the world for no
trouble at all.” Came on his mob re-
cently, just when he’d decided to cana P-
For an hour or more he fussed round the
herd, made sure his nag had everything,
then, lighting a fire on the wet ground,
he hacked a slab from a squeaking, week-
old loaf and fed himself. A bit
later he raked away the fire, scattered
coals and ash to the wet night, and tested
the ground gingerly. With it scraped to
his satisfaction he curled up on the spot,
spread his oiler over the top and, re-
sembling nothing so much as a large
turtle, pulled his head in and retired.
Hail, rain or snow, S. swears by the
method, the only thing that wakes him
being when “some silly damn’ cow walks
about on a man.”

“C.V.E.”: “B. A. Ker’s” yarn about

“Chuck”: “Cripes, me best dog’s eaten
some of that poisoned carcass,” Stan
explained worriedly. “S’pose you don’t
know a good cure?” “Surfe,” Paddy
soothed him. “Shove a lump o’ blue-
stone down his throat and he’ll be right in
no time. ’Bout as big as a pea. Then
tie him up somewhere.” Stan overflowed
with thanks, paused for a few more de-
tails, and hurried off. A couple of weeks
later he was working in the paddock
when Paddy raced up on a sweating
nag. “It’s me prize greyhound,” Paddy
wailed. “Swallered a strychnine bait.
Gosh, I wouldn’t lose that dog f’r twenty
quid. That bluestone y’ gave yours, Stan,

mean ... Did he get better?” “Too right
he did!” Stan said heartily. “I did just
what you told me. Why?” “That’s

but y’ never know, I wanted to make
sure about it before I gave it to Brownie.”

“Bullshead” attends an N.T. trial:
Aparoonimingi, known as Big Liz, was chief
brown witness at the trial of the cattleman
charged with the unlawful shooting of an
aboriginal. Eyes rolling, and her imposing
front quivering under the cheap colored print
frock —the gift of a benign Gub’ment —she
polished the already-shiny seat in the witness-
box with restless wrigglings. The courtroom
was stifling as the packed onlookers —mostly
white-clothed office-workers, with a few hard-
looking bushmen —sweltered in the tropic heat.
The old lubra’s testimony had been damning,
for she claimed to be an eyewitness to the
tragedy, and the going looked a bit tough for
the accused. Spider had allegedly been dis-
covered in the act of butchering a bullock in
the Sandstone Ranges behind Mac’s cattle-run,
and of a fusillade of bullets one had found
a mark in the chest of the old abo. Big Liz
looked truculently at accused’s counsel as
he rose to- cross-examine, but softened visibly
as the little barrister asked her mildly to recount
certain portions of her story. Big Liz spoke
importantly. “I bin see ’im, boss, two feller
Spider and Cockatoo findem bullick—no more
’im spearem mind!’’ she added hastily. The
gallery chuckled and the Judge rubbed a top
lip thoughtfully. “Well, Bulka—’im” —here she
pointed with her bottom lip in the direction
of the quiet figure sealed at his counsel’s table
—“bin ride up alonga top. ’E bin shootem
’im gun. Boom!” “What did Spider and
Cockatoo do?” asked the barrister softly. Big
Liz glanced around the room and chuckled
fatly, “Cockatoo ’im bin runaway—’im still
goin’ and Spider bin ’idem meself quickfeller.”
“Supposem Spider bin hide —how that bullet
catch him?” asked counsel curiously. “That
bullet ’im bin come quickfeller—Spider ’im
bin lay down behind longa tree —bullet ’im bin
come this way—that way!” The excited lubra
waved her hand in the air, The hush in the
room could be felt. “Yes. Then what hap-
pened?” “That bullet ’im go past Spider
and” —she looked triumphantly at the goggle-
eyed Crown prosecutor “ ’im bin come
back and kill Spider dead!” The roar which
greeted this climax could be heard in China-
town. The Judge lay back resignedly in his
big chair as the lanky Crown Law man wiped
his forehead and prepared to leave the court.
Accused discharged.
THE DUST OF THE YEARS.
With the silks in the sunlight gleaming,
With the sheen on the satin coats,
With the field round the bush course streaming
To the cheer of five hundred throats;

His best to outstride his peers;
In the wake of the swift hoofs 'flying

With the sheep in the yard-wings ringing,
With the cattle rounded on camp,
With the ten-ton wool-loads swinging
Where the slow-stepped bullocks tramp;
In the sleepy township swirling
As the lazy bush-wind veers;
On the open claypan curling
I see it —the dust of the years.
From the old life careless and idle,
From the old days merry and gay,
From the joys of saddle and bridle
What dreams do we carry away?
A winning ride at the races?
A gallop that headed the steers?
The call of the Open Spaces?
And —only the Dust of the Years.

"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO

A Gammexane Dip Test.
“Outback”: After experi-
menting with gammexane in a
station dip for over 12 months
P. A. Elliot, Moolboolaman,
Gin Gin (Q.), says it kills rapidly
and has given excellent control.
The material was a gammexane
formula put up by a pro-
prietary firm and called S.S.A.A.
A measured concentration of .02
per cent, gamma isomer was
used, and the new emulsion-type
bath remained fully effective for
over 12 months. The main ob-
ject of the trial was to control
the cattle-tick on 1000 head of
cattle,
Elliot gives his observations
as follows: (1) cattle were
cleaned speedily and effectively
at each djpping; (2) the period
between * dippings, compared
with an arsenical dip mixture,
was practically doubled; (3)
cattle were clean of coat and
remarkably thrifty; (4) there
was absolutely no scalding and
no after-effects ; (5) it was safe to
use, and stock could be dipped
at any time of the day, even in
the hottest weather ; (6) calving
figures were extremely high.
Elliot said he felt that a wet-
table powder was not the most
desirable for use in a cattle dip,
and that an emulsion bath would
be much superior, mainly be-
cause of its extremely high wet-
ting power, and the toxic
material, being in solution in the
oil base, was left m a soluble
form on the hide of the beast
enveloping every parasite.
The emulsifiable product con-
tained a concentration of ap-
proximately 40 per cent, ben-
zene hexachloride, equal to 4
per cent, gamma isomer. The
material was poured into the dip
and stirred at the rate of one
gallon to every 200 gallons of
water. A sgal. drum would
charge 1000 gallons of water to
give a .02 per cent. g.i. concen-
tration. The approximate cost
of charging a 3000-gallon dip
was £27, and the cost of dipping
under Id. per head for average
cattle in the summer months.
Unfortunately the field work is
now held up, as the base oil is
a newly-developed type from the
U.S.A., and the Federal Gov-
ernment has imposed restrictions
on its import.
Footrot.
“Jock”: Suspect it if more
than a few sheep go lame, In
severe cases sheep kneel to feed
or may refuse to stand at all.
Eliminate other causes of lame-
ness —injury from travelling on
hard roads, penetrating injuries
when feeding on stubble, the
mud-caked foot of the sheep on
swamp, and the long, deformed
hoof due to soft pasture.
Diagnosis is made by paring
away the hoof and finding dead,
grey-colored sections. Beware of
thinking that the disease will
clear up without treatment —fre-
quently it appears to do so, but.
the germ remains in the feet and
will flare up later. Treatment is
simple. The hoofs must be pared
away with a knife, pruning-
shears or snippers—all infected
parts should be temoved if pos-
sible. Next an antiseptic lotion
is applied, and this is most effi-
ciently performed by having a
bath 20ft. long, Ift. wide and
about 6in. deep. Fill with 20
p.c. bluestone solution (21b. per
gallon) or 5 p.c. formaldehyde
solution. Both are irritating to
human skin, so avoid unneces-
sary contact. Each sheep re-
mains in the bath three or four
minutes, but it may have to be
repeated in severe cases. After
the bath affected sheep should
be pastured away from the flock
for a month. Where sheep are
too lame to be moved treat in
the paddock by paring aqd soak-
ing in solution which can con-
veniently be used in a jam-tin.
The foot parings should not be
left in the paddock but collected
and burnt with those from the
yards.
When a paddock is known to
be infected it should be spelled
for four weeks in hot, dry
weather. In wet country the
germ probably persists for as
long as three months in the ab-
sence of sheep—the exact time is
not known—but if the paddock
is rested for four months it will
be safe. Buy sheep from a flock
known to be footrot-free for six
months previously, and if this
cannot be done keep new sheep
isolated for a month after com-
ing on to the place. If no lame-
ness develops in this time they
can be considered clean.
Downs Linseed.
“Herbert”: On the Darling
Downs 6000 acres will go into
production this year, compared
with 130 acres last season.
Growers have been guaranteed
£4O a ton for sound, fully-
matured linseed at country sid-
ings, or a price equal to the
current value of imported lin-
seed of equal quality ruling at
the date of delivery. It is anti-
cipated that this season’s planting
will return approximately
£120,000 to growers.
Last season’s experiments
with Walsh variety proved
Downs soils to be highly suit-
able for linseed. The only
variety grown, Walsh, gave an
average oil content of 40 per
cent., which was regarded as
most satisfactory. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture is experi-
menting on small plots to test
different linseed varieties, mainly
around Pittsworth and Brook-
stead, on the rich Condamine
watershed, and varieties under
test include Ameliore, Ghahreh,
Morocco, Malabriglo and Rio,
as well as the already proved
Walsh type.
One Brookstead grower col-
lected £375 from a 20-acre pad-
dock and a Pitfsworth man
reaped £l9B from a 10-acre plot.
Twelve acres at Oakey returned
£203, with £2OO from 10 acres at
Mt. Tyson, on the fringe of Cecil
Plains, and in the vicinity of
Dalby £156 was the cheque from
10 acres* Yield on the south-
“An this little piggie Went to market.”
eastern Downs, on the Allora
lucerne-growing flats, was ex-
ceptionally promising, three
acres bringing a return of £2O an
acre. If crops pan out right this
season and there is a guaranteed
price next year, it is expected
that 20,000 to 25,000 acres will
be devoted to linseed production.
Onions in Queensland.
“Mat”: In Queensland all
onions, except a few in vege-
table-gardens, are harvested long
before December. October is
chief month for harvesting,
though growers sometimes cut
onions—admittedly immature —
earlier to catch an onion-empty
market and consequent high
prices. Late autumn and early
winter are planting times, but,
though many experiments ha.ve
been made in order to get earlier
onions, growers seldom manage
to get their onions to bulb until
the cold weather is past.
No one growing onions in
quantity considers transplanting.
Seed is put in with a drill, and
the plants thinned out when
firmly established. The extra
seed used is more than compen-
sated by the time saved in trans-
planting, and plants set in per-
manent positions receive no
check to growth as transplanted
seedlings do. Onion seed is
hardy and, provided tested seed
is obtained, germination is
usually high.
Queensland onions are milder
and softer than southern onions
and do not keep as well. The
onions are pulled when the tops
begin to wither, tops and roots
being trimmed with shears, then
the onions should be spread in
a shaded airy place to dry before
being bagged. It is not practic-
able to leave Queensland onions
in the ground until the tops die
right off, as they are likely to
sunburn or, if heavy spring
storms ensue, rot. Seed suited
to Queensland conditions must
be obtained, as many southern
types will not bulb properly here.
Seed produced locally or in
northern N.S.W. is necessary for
successful onion-growing in
Queensland.
Keep Out Dust.
“K.L.M.”: Users of small
motors and dynamos don’t
always appreciate the necessity
for protecting them from the
dust inseparable from a feed-
room or workshop. The caps of
lubricators should be kept
closed, and a light cover of metal
or canvas should be devised to
exclude foreign bodies, oil,
etc. Armatures should occa-
sionally be wiped clean with a
petrol rag; never use emery-
paper. Oil should be used spar-
ingly and terminals kept clean
and tight. It speaks well for
the rugged construction of
modern motors that they give as
little trouble as they do. With
proper treatment there is
scarcely any limit to their use-
ful life.
A Saw-bench.
“C.A.A.”: A useful home-
made tractor saw-bench which
has the additional advantage of
being portable may be con-
structed from a framework of
4in. by Sin. timber bolted to-
gether. The feeding platform
consists of a piece of 9in. by lin.
board, fitted with guide rings
underneath to slide backward
and forward along three lengths
of |in. piping carried on short
uprights attached to the frame.
A vertical back-rest will hold the
log in position. Bolt the bench
directly to the draw-bar with
two bolts, thus allowing it to
be easily detachable. When the
saw is in operation place a block
of wood under the outer cross-
member of the frame to carry
part of the weight and ensure
stability.
Use a 20in. saw and a 4£in.
pulley, connected by a crossed
drive-belt to a 15in. pulley on
the tractor. Estimating tractor
idling speed at about 450 r.p.m.,
this gives a satisfactory saw
speed of about 1500 r.p.m. When
using, feed along the platform
and push the platform towards
the saw. The design permits
the operator to stand well clear
of the line of the saw and ob-
viates danger to the hands.
Only the removal of the block
is necessary to enable the trac-
tor to be driven to a stand of
firewood, the belt acting as a
tie-rod to ease the strain on the
drawbar. Despite the unortho-
dox method of attachment, the
machine rides well.
Trees for Soldiers.
“C.S.”: The Victorian “Save
the Forests” campaign has per-
suaded the State Government to
finance the cost of raising trees
in its nursery for planting on
soldier-settlers’ blocks. Prime
object is utilitarian, to provide
trees for shelter-belts and farm
wood-lots. The trees are:
Mahogany - gum, sugar - gum,
bushy sugar-gum, river redgum,
forest redgum, greybox,
spotted-gum, silky-oak, blue-
gum, blackwood, Queensland
brushbox and sweet pitto-
sporum.
There, will be a limit for the
first year of 100 trees per settler.
Soldier-settlers interested should
write to the Honorary Campaign
Director, “Save the Forests”
Campaign, 422 Collins-street,
Melbourne, C.l, stating briefly
the layout of the property, pur-
pose of plantation, number of
trees desired and any other par-
ticulars.
Trees will be supplied free of
charge to soldier-settlers on the
following conditions: Plantation
to be securely fenced against
stock and vermin, ground to be
thoroughly prepared, planting
and care after planting to be in
accordance with methods recom-
mended, plantation to be open
for public inspection at times
agreed to by the settler, brief
report on the plantation to be
forwarded once a year by the

Brigalow Rolling.
“Atlanta”: On his 9000-acre
Sherwood property, near Tara
(Q.), T. Eley and his two sons
have evolved a roller drawn by
a crawler-type tractor which
goes over the brigalow, smash-
ing it to the ground. Made from
a gum log 3ft. in diameter, 9ft.
lOin. long, the roller is fitted
with four cutters —steel blades
4in. wide running the length of
the log. The jolting motion of
the roller adds to the smashing
effect of the cutters. Mounted
on the roller is a sawn briga-
low frame, stayed to take maxi-
mum stress. This is attached to
the 32-h.p. tractor by a 30ft.
Moreton Bay ash pole, with a
distance of 20ft. between tractor
drawbar and roller. Total
weight of the roller is three tons.
The tractor is protected by a
bumper sheet in front of the
engine and a steel frame protects
the driver. In a recent demon-
stration the tractor was driven
into dense brigalow suckers 15
to 20 feet high and six to eight
inches thick. Acting as a bull-
dozer the tractor pushed down
the biggest of the timber while
the roller projecting from both
sides of the tractor broke down
and rolled the lot under. A 3ft.
2in. steel roller, not yet delivered
by the manufacturers, will carry
a bar set high to push over the
bigger trees, enabling the
rollers to “walk” up and over
them.
Excluding tractor depreciation
and labor, running costs approxi-
mate 2s. 6d. per hour, in which
time about two acres can be
rolled. At present it may cost
up to 255. per acre to clean with
the axe.
On the Eley property an area
rolled before the war is today
98 per cent, clean. In a second
patch, not long rolled, 75 acres
were rolled in 28 hours. After
rolling, brigalow is fired when
the time is suitable, but ex-
perience is the only guide here.
Some years it can be burned
ofter falling without prolific
suckering, at others it will
smother in suckers. Occasionally,
too, the 12-months interval
recommended by the Lands
Dept, will produce a dense
regrowth. With Eley’s method
it is possible to plough without
further stumping, as the roller
breaks stumps off right in the
ground. If suckers appear, the
area is enclosed with an electric
fence and flogged out with sheep.
Today, after 28 years’ battle
with brigalow, the Eley property
runs 5000 sheep and has 240
acres under tl\e plough.
The Horse in Winter.
“W. Court”: Isolate a horse
that coughs and refuses his feed.
If strangles is the trouble an
abscess will form under the jaw,
and it should be “ripened” up
with hot packs before being
lanced. If you turn a horse
suffering from strangles out to
take his chance, complications,
such as blood-poisoning or
pneumonia, may develop and
kill him.
Influenza develops like
strangles, but, although the throat
is sore and swallowing difficult,
there is no abscess. Influenza
can be very serious and is always
infectious. The farther the sick
horse is kept from his fellows
the better. Influenza does not
respond well to any remedy, but
a strong horse will often throw
it off if kept warm and dry for
two to three weeks. Medicated
steam —produced by dropping
eucalyptus oil or Friar’s balsam
into boiling water —gives tem-
porary relief if the horse can be
made to inhale it. Rubbing the
throat with mustard and vinegar
is worth while to lessen the sore-
ness. The food should be
nourishing gruel, and plenty of
drinking water should be handy.
A vet.’s assistance should be
obtained.
Hints for the Farm.
“Wilco”: When horses are
seen licking the sweat off each
other on a hot day it’s a sure
sign they need salt. They can-
not sweat without losing salt,
and non-sweating horses soon go
under to heat. Put a small lump
of rock-salt in each box. It helps
keep them free of intestinal
worms and checks such nasty
habits as “crib-biting” and
“wind-sucking.”
“Bill C.”: Horses should not
be worked so hard until sun-
down that they are unharnessed
in a lather of sweat. Such
handling predisposes them to
influenza and similar winter
ailments. The men who turn
their horses out wet are also the
ones who are indifferent about
taking care of them when they
fall sick.
“Sarina”: If you get lime in
your eye the burning will be
allayed if a few drops of castor-
or olive-oil are run into the eye.
Follow up by* washing the eye
out with sweetened water or
syrup, which will destroy the
causticity of the lime.
“Homo”: To poison rabbits
scrape pieces of black Scotch
thistle and place on paper in
sun for a time, then coat lightly
with honey by shaking in a tin
in which a, small quantity of
thin homey Ms been placed. Dry
the thistle sections again and
apply (to 300 baits) two tea-
spoons of strychnine mixed
with as much white arsenic as
will fit on a threepence. Collect
baits not taken.
“T.F.”: Don’t feed too mpch
rape to laying fowls, as it will
turn the yolks pale and you
will lose financially. Chinese
cabbage (wom-bok) is quick-
growing and good feed. Pick
only the outside leaves and a
patch will last for months.
“Radian”: When a new file
keeps choking with filings rub a
heavy coating of chalk into the
teeth. This will clear the filings
and will not injure the file.
“Myrr”: Give peach-, nec-
tarine-, cherry-, apricot- and
plum-trees a routine spray of
Bordeaux at “pink-bud” stage.
It will help control scab on
apricots, prune-rust on plums,
curly - leaf on peaches and
brown-rot on all of these fruits.
Make the spray 6:6:40 (61b. of
bluestone, 61b. of slaked lime,
40 gallons of water). Mix lime
and bluestone separately in non-
metallic vessels, combine and
spray immediately.
“M.”; Take all rubber parts
and subject them to a routine
weekly boiling for 10 minutes in
a caustic solution, two table-
spoons to four gallons of water.
To prevent the rubbers sticking
to the hot metal, place them in a
sugar-bag or perforated wooden
box. Transfer to pure boiling
water for a few minutes to re-
move the caustic and allow to
cool down slowly. By com-
pletely removing corroding milk
fats this treatment increases the
life of the rubbers as well as
keeping them clean.
“Gem”: When turning con-
crete don’t do it in a heap.
Heaping makes the shovel load
heavy. Spread the mix to about
three inches deep, and it will
need to be turned only three
times dry and twice wet.

Another Socialised
“Enterprise.”
“The British Government intends to
purchase the Royal Covent Garden
Opera House with the aim of building
up a national opera with popular
prices.”
The Joint Opera Board was in
grand form.
The two-months (estimated)
reconstruction job at Covent
Garden at a cost (estimated) at
£17,000 had just been finished
after 15 months at a cost of
£129,000.
A few months before the first
of the socialised operas for the
people was due to be presented
and when the director was pres-
sing it for a decision, the board
decided to defer decision as to
what opera to commence with
until full reports had been re-
ceived from its “experts.” The
original intention had been to
open with Wagner’s “Master-
singers,” but it was felt that
emphasis on any master-class
might be regarded as antagonistic
to the masses and contrary to
the principles of the British
“Labor” party.
After 14 more meetings of the
board, with still no decision
reached, it was resolved to send
various senior officers of the
board to the chief opera houses
of Europe to study the position
there. In the meantime the com-
pany, after some weeks of hang-
ing around waiting for re-
hearsals, had been disbanded.
Several months later the re-
ports of the various investigating
officers were typed and collated,
but as the chairman was by then
in America in pursuance of the
board’s policy of establishing
better cultural relations with the
Metropolitan Opera directorate,
and as he hadn’t
specifically dele-
gated authority,
consideration of the
reports had to
await his return.
Finally, after
several more abor-
tive meetings, the
board decided to
open with “Tales
of Hoffman,”
This wasn’t what
the board wanted.
It would have
preferred “ Ri g o -
letto,” which its specially-
augmented research sub-com-
mittee had recommended. In a
majority report the sub-com-
mittee had urged that “Rigo-
letto” should, like the Gilbert
and Sullivan operas, carry an
alternative title, and had strongly
urged “The Body in the Bag,”
as it was felt this would make a
stronger cultural appeal to the
workers.
Unfortunately they had struck
a hiatus when considering
“Rigoletto.” It was felt that the
only one who could do full
justice to the role of the assassin
Sparafucile, who is engaged by
the hunchbacked jester to bump
off his dissolute master the Duke
of Mantua, would be a Com-
munist. No Commo basso was
available —and there was sup-
posed to be a ban on Comrades
in the civil service, anyway.
The final decision to start With
“Tales of Hoffman” was the re-
sult of a Ministerial hint that a
compliment to the European Ad-
ministrator of the Marshall Aid
programme wouldn’t be out of
place. It wasn’t until the open-
ing night, when it was 100 late
to alter it, that the personal clerk
to the board’s chief clerk
pointed out to his boss that the
opera’s title might be interpreted
as a reflection on Mr, Hoffman’s
veracity.
The company was re-engaged
and rehearsals began, but de-
cision as to the opening date was
deferred pending the board’s de-
cision on the specifications for
the mechanical doll to be used
in Act I. A special sub-com-
mittee was appointed to consider
this and to call for tenders.
Further delay was caused by
b last-week decision to eliminate
Hoffman’s duel scene with
Schlemil, this being considered
offensive to the Left-wing group
of back-bench “Government”
pacifists. Instead, the poet was
made to endeavor to win the
“Someone stole the rope!”
hand of Lady Giulietta by mak-
ing an impassioned speech for a
36-hour week for the down-
trodden Venetian gondolieri.
Another sub-committee then
recommended that the famous
Barcarolle should be stepped-up
from languorous 6-8 time in
keeping with the current drive
for greater output, and that the
words of the duet should be
altered from the “beauteous
night” theme to the more vig-
orous one of the socialised
gondolier industry.
The opening date was again
deferred to give effect to an-
other sub-committee recommen-
dation that alteration should be
made in Act 111, in which
the young singer Antonia sings
herself to death by consumption
when urged to it by Dr. Miracle,
the family’s secret enemy. It was
decided to alter the disease to
ringworm, and thus give the
chance, with an extensive re-
vision of the text, to work in
some publicity for the “Govern-
ment’s” “free”-medicine scheme
when she is cjared by a nation-
alised doctor prescribing from
the official formulary.
The full committee, consisting
of all sub-committee chairmen,
finally recommended to the
board that in the epilogue, in-
stead of having him sadly re-
nounce the love of women in
favor of his art, the poet should
at curtain-fall be installed with
his last love, Stella, in a Gov-
ernment pre-fab. house, with his
bride happily about to depart to
share the communal kitchen with
14 other women.
Hoffman himself to
become president
of the new militant
Poets’ Union,
bringing the opera
to tremendous close
with a fiery anti-
Tory speech.
The day follow-
ing the premiere
the Minister for
Socialised Opera
met the chair-
man of the Joint
Opera Board.
The latter, rubbing his hands
elatedly, proclaimed the opera a
great success, despite the critics.
“Financially, I hope,” said the
Minister.
“I’ll say it was!” declared the
chairman proudly. “Why,
enough came in from the parts
of the house that weren’t taken
up by the board members and
friends to almost pay for front-
of-the-house expenses! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

That Seventh State
I like the warm confidence in “K.A.S.”
when he says (B. 21/7/’4B) that the next
five years should see New England take
its place as a seventh State of the Com-
monwealth, Unfortunately, I remember
a lot of people saying exactly the same
thing up in the Rivers in 1930.
Much, in the first place, will depend on
how strongly the New Englanders want
a new State and the reasons they want
it. The last new-State movement there
was allowed to die when there was a
change of Government in New South
Wales in 1932—what the new-Staters had
really wanted then was the end of Lang,
not a new State. If there are to be strength
and purpose in the new movement, it
must stem from something more positive
than reaction. In other words, the new
State must be something good and im-
portant in itself.
“K.A.S.” is right in pointing out the
danger of diffusion. There is little to
be gained in cutting a large new State
out of a larger existing State. Regional
cohesion is the logical basis for drawing
boundaries. New Englanders have already
overstepped the logical mark by including
the Tablelands as well as the Northern
Rivers. Enthusiasm has swept the whole
area, but rifts in the new-State party
are already evident.
There is little common interest be-
tween the Coast and the Tablelands. The
Coast, reaching from Murwillumbah
down to, say, Kempsey and westwards
to the Dividing Range, forms an organic
unit in which dairying, butter, cheese,
pigs, bananas and sugar-cane are the
main interests. Its problems are river-
siltage, flood-control, irrigation, deep-sea
ports—all peculiar to and characteristic
of the Coast, But the Tablelands mark
the eastern fringe of the wool-and-wheat
economy of the central- and north-west;
their economic interests look that way,
not to the east.
True, there is a long-deferred hope of
a railway connecting the Tablelands with
the Coast, but that is not enough if
there are no other unifying factors. Last
year I went down the scenic but death-
trap hundred-mile trip from Glen Innes
to Grafton by bus. I had the feeling of
going almost from one country to
another.
Finally, there is the site for the capital.
If “K.A.S.” had read the story of the
selection of the site for Canberra he
would not be so sanguine as to “logical
choices.” That held up Canberra in one
way and another for the best part of a
decade and could likewise hold up New
England. I just can’t see the Coasters
swallowing a Tablelands city as the capi-
tal, whatever the logic.—W. D. (N.S W,).
Erosion in Queensland
Erosion in western Queensland is
generally attributed to overstocking—
pastoral holdings are subdivided by the
owner (the Crown) into minimum living
areas and tenants wishing to live above
the breadline overstock their leases.
But there is a further cause of de-
terioration of Crown lands. Suppose two
men A and B take up blocks of similar
sheep-land, rent l|d. per acre. A, who is
fond of the city life, spends everything
the property earns on city, town and sea-
side investments; B, who likes the land,
puts all his earnings back, into the
property.
After seven years A’s block has de-
teriorated while B’s has improved. Rents
are reassessed and A gets a reduction
and Ban increase. Why? Ais a bad
tenant, while B, by reafforestation,
erosion-control and regrassing, has in-
creased the capital value of the land-
lord’s holding. Yet he is penalised by
having his rent increased.
If “additional areas” are available A
will have a better chance to acquire and
exploit one than B will, because A’s
carrying capacity is less than B’s,
A “reversal of policy” is needed, and
concessions must be given to those who
improve the land. Judicious stocking
and eradication of rabbits will bring a
growth of young mulga and reduce
erosion. Approximate contour furrows
or cross-wind furrows on claypans will
eventually rejuvenate them. But the
enterprising man who undertakes this
work at his own expense must not be
penalised.
Further “controls” are useless. What
is required is unhampered private interest
and initiative. —C. (Q.).
Free Speech
I’ve seen a great number of meetings
since the war where there have been
motions for the suppression of Com-
munists. Invariably they have been
opposed on the ground that “everyone,
no matter what his belief, has the right
to express his opinion.” The opposers
often emphasised, at the same time, that
they personally hated Communism.
This uneasy feeling about the “right
to free speech” has been a very useful
weapon to our bitterest enemies. Cer-
tainly any humorless ass steeped in Das
Kapital and Professor Laski is free to
mount his stump and convince as many
as he can that the workers’ faces are
being ground into the coal-dust and that
all will be roses when the State owns and
runs everything for the Kremlin. Whether
he is merely doing what he is told, or
believes what he says, he is the proud
possessor of what Mr. Chifley calls
“political philosophy,” and stands
squarely under the cherished right of
free speech, so long as he keeps out
of Europe and Asia.
But the point, overlooked by decent
tolerant Australians, is that there is no
right to advocate crime. Nobody, not
even one of the Government’s own
bosses, has any right to preach treason
or the overthrow of government by force,
or to arrange conspiracies to sabotage
defence and industry. Not only has he
no right, but he commits a crime in
doing so, and it is the duty of the Crown
“Now let's see what comes next."
—and of all loyal subjects for that mat-
ter —to prosecute crime.
As for the right to criticise, it was
gained for us at the cost of the lives
of some of our forebears, and we thought
a lot of it through the succeeding cen-
turies until recently. But in 1944 a
Minister of the Government which is
so tenderly solicitous of the rights of
Communists to preach and act sedition
succeeded for a while in a total ban
of the press. Not, of course, for any
incitements to revolt or to stop the im-
perialist war or such things. The news-
papers had simply criticised the Govern-
ment, after it had been distinctly told
not to.
Both the Honorable Minister and his
Government were returned to office with
a thumping majority in 1946, so I sup-
pose they feel that the right to free speech
doesn’t matter much now, unless, of
course, it is proposed to prohibit it to
Communists.
Still, many people throughout the
country had a queer taste in theiumouths
last year when they were suddenly in-
terviewed by strange police. It appeared
that they had attended public meetings,
protesting about bank nationalisation and
such matters, and they were required to
explain all about it.
The right of criticism does not exist
now in many parts of the world. If it
is to be kept alive here, being kind to
Communists is not the way to do it. —
Khasi Rokok (N.S.W.).
The Police
Two migrant policemen have resigned
from the Melbourne Police Force be-
cause “Australians are too ready to help
a criminal against the policemen arresting
him, and have a natural suspicion and
grudge against policemen.”
Twenty-five years ago there may have
been reason for criticism of the force, but
the policemen of the last two decades
measure up favorably with the London
Metropolitan. Over the last 20 years I
have met them in many roles. I’ve been
lumbered off rattlers by them during the
depression, and I remember the apologetic
air of the cop in the N.Q. town who ran
a couple of us in for stealing a ride. “The
local stationmaster,” he explained,-“is a
fair cow.” Later, with the bad days be-
hind, I met them from the Bench and
again, when working with “I” in the
Army, and I’ve been chipped (always
politely) for minor traffic breaches. In
all that time I’ve only met one who came
up to the designation scrawled in the
Townsville watchhouse - yard: “All
coppers are b s.” He was.
The Australian’s mistrust of police
probably lies in the inadequate instruction
in elementary civics in our schools. Get
the right idea into a child’s mind before
he’s eight, and it’s there for life. I was
always taught that the man in blue was a
friend and that, away from home, I must
always go to him in trouble. Later I
was told that policemen were incorrup-
tible. I didn’t believe it, and passed 10s,,
with my grandfather’s name, to the cop
who chided me about speeding.
Haled before the Court two days later,
I pulled £2 for speeding, plus £lO and a
whale of a lecture for “attempting to
bribe a policeman.” The 10s. was pro-
duced as evidence and confiscated by the
Crown. My grandfather (a solicitor)
prosecuted for the municipality, asked for
a heavy fine, and then paid it. I was short
of pocket-money for the next 12 months.
Policemen received £3 10s. a week in
those days.
By the time I was 201 had fully realised
the policeman’s place in the scheme of
things. The integrity of the force was
. taken for granted, and the Australian
attitude, when I first encountered it, was
foreign.
The way to proper understanding and
respect of the force lies in correct teach-
ing of the youngster. Build that up, and
you have the foundation of a community
which will respect the law. Add to that
heavy penalties for cases of proved cor-
ruption in the police, and top it off with
no less than three years for police bashers,
and the prospect of a peaceful community
is in sight.— Video (Q.).
Television
The announcement that the P.M.G.’s
Department and A.B.C. will probably
exercise exclusive control over television
in Australia is typical of the present
Federal Government.
It’s a safe bet that if newspapers \tfere
a new invention, like television, the Gov-
ernment would try to get control of them.
It is thinking of doing the next best thing
—ex-journalist Leslie Haylen, M.H.R. for
Parkes (N.S.W.), was recently authorised
to survey the possibilities of a chain of
Labor Sunday newspapers, the Labor
party having noted the success of Sunday
newspapers now published in most capital
cities.
In radio, too, the Government is try-
ing to get full control of frequency-
modulation broadcasting, so that when
F.M. is in general use the Government
of the day will have exclusive control of
broadcasting.
These are dangerous tendencies —a
Government monopoly is always more
dangerous than a private one. — Alan
Staples (Vic.).
Local Government
A few more comments can be added
to those of The Bulletin (14/7/’4B) on
the forced amalgamation of the councils
in and around Nowra (N.S.W.). The
amalgamation was sponsored by Nowra,
which, under the administration of W. C.
Batt, town clerk, had become one of the
most highly-rated towns in the State.
Adjoining councils made the funda-
mental mistake of opposing all amal-
gamation. Some was justified. Broughton
Vale, with an annual income of less than
£lOOO, was an anachronism. So was South
Shoalhaven. Cambewarra Shire was
small, and the municipality of UUadulla
had refused for years to appoint a proper
health official. But the local aldermen
and shire councillors said “all or nothing.”
The town clerk of Berry refused to co-
operate with the objectors. So the object-
ing councils had to appoint as secretary
the town clerk of Gerringong, which was
not even in the proposed scheme.
Under Labor Governments, preference
to servicemen simply does not exist, so
top jobs went to young non-servicemen,
while returned men with equal qualifica-
tions were overlooked.
Berry municipality, the second-largest
council in point of revenue in the com-
bined area, was completely ignored by
the Minister when shire councillors were
appointed. Berry has a long record of
civic pride and loyalty. In enlistments in
both wars it can show points to any
other town of its size in the State ; in con-
tributions to patriqtic funds it is second
to none, in N. S. Wales, anyhow. And its
50 square miles are among the most pro-
ductive in the Commonwealth. It had
some able men on its council, notably the
Mayor, but these were completely over-
looked, so that the Minister might find
room for a couple of union officials who
had been rejected by the people of Nowra.
The whole business smells to high
heaven. If local government means any-
thing, it certainly means giving local
people a say, and the local people did not
want this amalgamation. And, if prefer-
ence to returned servicemen means any-
thing, it certainly means giving them a
chance when there is a billet worth £lOOO
p.a. going begging.
The Liberal party should come out and
tell the Shoalhaven electors that, when it
has emptied McGirr and company out,
it will reconsider the whole matter of
compulsory amalgamations. — Sandpatch
(N.S.W.).
Government Waste
According to the list of increased
Federal expenditure, the Department of
the Treasury is one of the worst squan-
derers. Treasurer Chifley has not
bothered to explain the huge increase in
the cost of his department; there should
be no dearth of critics when the Budget
is presented.
One Treasury extravagance is the
Commonwealth Loan Directorate, which,
like other bodies created for war-time
needs, has long outlived its usefulness.
Salaries and commission paid to ad-
ministrative staff and canvassers, plus the
cost of large and frequent press adver-
tisements, must amount to a considerable
wasted sum.
It’s a sharp comment on bureaucracy
that, before a recent visit of a loan-
canvasser, several residents were advised
some days previously by post —cost of
printing, stationery, postage and clerical
work all on the taxpayer —to expect a
call, and that the list of “prospects” was
obviously compiled after scrutiny of sav-
ings accounts in the Commonwealth
Bank. — Brutus (Q.).
The Root of the Matter
Although there have been alarming
outbreaks of infantile paralysis in Aus-
tralia in the last two or three years, there
was no Australian representative at the
international poliomyelitis conference,
which began in New York on July 12.
Among the 1800 delegates from 39
countries the only Australian in evidence
was Sister Kenny, who, of course, was
practically driven out of the country years
ago. It is extraordinary that Australia
was not officially represented at a confer-
ence where discussions and decisions
might prove of vital importance in future
treatment of poliomyelitis. There is too
much attention given here to “free” medi-
cine and other political schemes and too
little to really urgent aspects of public
health. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Despite many protests and an appar-
ently unassailable case a year or so ago,
royalties from books are still taxed at
the property rate, which is much higher
than the personal-exertion rate. If I
had a dozen short stories published in
The Bulletin the money I received for
them would be taxable under personal
exertion. If the same 12 stories were
so good that The Bulletin republished
them in book form, I would pay property-
rate tax on the royalties. In the tax-
year 1947-48 I received £76 in book
royalties, and £37 of it will go to the
Taxation Department. — Dee (N.S.W.).
Mr. Chifley acted as expected when
he admitted the difficulty of obtaining
union permission to ship small-arms to
Malaya. But there is other transport.
One plane-load of pistols, rifles, grenades
and Owen guns would satisfy the
planters, who, after all, are only asking
for help to defend their lives. And in
New Guinea waters is an Australian
frigate, carrying full war-time armament
and ammunition. It is not known if her
crew includes any of those Perth sur-
vivors sold into Jap slavery by “Inder-
nesian comrades” for 30 guilders apiece,
but there would be others who would
probably welcome a slap at those “com-
rades.” — Jemac (N.S.W.).
