SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1886.
There is no more pernicious form of govern-
ment than that of a corrupt Democracy.
A worthless Court or an intrigueing aristo-
cracy may exist for centuries, and, passing
away, leave the body politic sound. But
when rulers, chosen by the people them-
selves, prove false to their trust, and when
their turpitude has little effect in destroying
public confidence in them, national putre-
faction has set in. This was probably in
De Tocqueville’s mind when he wrote :
“The corruption of men who have casually
risen to power has a coarse and vulgar Infection
in it which renders it contagious to the multitude.
To pillage the public purse, and to vend
the favours of the State, are arts which the
meanest villain may comprehend, and hope to
practice in his turn. ... In a Democracy,
private citizens see a man of their own rank in
life, who rises from that obscure position, and who
becomes possessed of riches and power in a few
years; the spectacle excites their surprise and
envy, and they are led to inquire how the person
who was yesterday their equal is to-day their
ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents or his
virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknow-
ledge that they are themselves less virtuous or
less talented than he was. They are, therefore, led
(and not unfrequently their conjecture is a
correct one) to impute his success mainly to some
of his defects; and an odious mixture is thus
formed of the ideas of turpitude and power, un-
worthiness and success, utility and dishonour.”—
Democracy in America.
Thus the effects of corrupt popular govern-
ments are more noxious and far-reaching
than those of any other form of rule.
Again, a system which challenges compari-
son with other systems should appear before
the world, with clean hands. When Euro-
pean nations discover that there is a real
connection between legislation and the
number of handsome women who assemble
at Washington; that, to obtain State conces-
sions, public companies are often obliged to
spend enormous sums on “ preliminary ex-
penses,” and that the uncompromising
patriot of yesterday, who lived in decent
homeliness and contracted chronic insomnia
through measures to benefit his fellows,
inhabits a palace to-day and rents a Scotch
xnoor, it is little wonder if Democracy ap-
pears to them even as a mirage—a pleasant
prospect, but a useless possession.

•“ it is because I am not an adversary of
Democracy that I have sought to speak of it
in all sincerity. Men will not accept truth
at the hands of their enemies, and truth is
seldom offered to them by their friends.”
The reason assigned by Da Tocquevillb for
pointing out the shortcomings of popular
rule will cover us also. It is because we
believe in Democracy, because we think it
not alone the best form of government, but
the only form adapted for a progressive
people, that we speak. There is not an Aus-
tralian colony in which, during tne last few
years, Ministers or members have not
done things which should have excluded
them for ever from any further share
in the public life of the community—
things which, in some cases, at all events,
should have placed them in the dock,
if a person who votes in a certain way,
'-either as the result of a direct bribe or be-
cause he thinks the measure he supports
pecuniarily benefit himself, is not de-
serving of hard labour and low diet, it is
because society extends to the corrupt legis-
lator the consideration it denies to the vul-
gar thief. Yet it requires no demonstration
to show that the former’s offence is much
the ranker of the two. One defies the law,
but the other muddies the very springs of
’national life. Take, for instance, the case
of a representative who obtains at a nominal
price shares in a public company with the
distinct understanding that he is to do his
best to induce the Government to purchase
the company’s property at a figure far
beyond its value. Or the case of one who,
to raise the value of his own land or of the
property of those willing to reward his ser-
vices, considers that a roundabout rather
than a direct railway would be a public
benefit. Why should the dipping of his
band in the common purse be regarded with
such complacency while the robbing of a
private till is punished with such rigour?
Instances of barefaced malfeasance are of
such common occurrence that people cease
to wonder, and content themselves with
laughter. When one of more than ordinary
impudence takes place the extreme course

is taken of expelling the guilty member.
But so charitably are these baekslidings
looked upon in many cases that the culprit
is sent triumphantly back to the House he
has disgraced. In thus allowing an elec-
torate to return whom it pleases, there is a
nice point of constitutional law involved.
W© trust the day is not far distant when a
person expelled from Parliament for using
for the furtherance of private gain the vote
entrusted to him for the general good will not
be eligible for re-election until acquitted by a
common jury. It is time that these actions
should be given their proper names—crimes
as mean as picking pockets and far more de-
tractive of morality. Until they are looked
upon as such and their perpetrators obliged
to defend themselves from behind gratings,
Democracy will offer a fair mark to the
shafts of its numerous enemies. To sentence
to a temporary deprivation of his seat one
who robs the State, while sending into penal
servitude one who steals a watch, is surely
the height of unwisdom.
♦ • *
It may be urged that the choice of electors
would be circumscribed by denying them
the right of returning to Parliament whom-
soever they wished. But the right is denied
in the case of convicted felons, uncertifi-
cated bankrupts, and others. Not long
since, in Victoria, a man was elected by a
good majority. It appeared, however, that
30 years previously he had failed for a small
sum, and, through negligence, failed to ob-
tain a certificate. He was a reputable
citizen, and against him no whisper of un-
fair dealing had ever been heard. But the
House was barred against him all the same.
A short time ago, in New South Wales, only
two members could be found at a well-
attended sitting to vote against the expul-
sion of a representative for a scandalous
malfeasance. His forced retirement was
but of short duration. Backed by his con-
stituency he, unabashed, took his seat again.
It is high time that steps should be taken
to render such abuses impossible. To allow
such a person to assist in framing laws
Is a grave scandal. Denying him the right
of ever again sitting in the Assembly he dis-
graced no more curtails the people’s privi-
leges than a similar denial extended to the
professional thief. We are not now dealing
with cases where members have been ex-
cluded merely for entertaining peculiar
political or theological opinions. Parlia-
ment may have the power to close its doors
against men unfortunate enough to hold
heterodox views on government and reli-
gion, but it certainly has not the right. In
English history there have been many cases
where, owing to prejudice run riot, men
have been tyrannically deprived of the
rights conferred upon them. That of Wilkes
in the last century and of Bradlaugh to-
day will at once occur. Of the latter’s ex-
clusion from the British House of Commons
it is difficult to speak with patience. The
persecution to which the member for
Northampton was subjected in his manful
efforts to support his undoubted claim is
one of the worst episodes in the history of
English representative government. The
motives which prompted the shameful
denial of justice were as mean as the reason-
ing by which they were supported was
puerile. For by no means the first time
Englishmen flaunted their Philistinism in
the world’s eyes, and stupidly accepted as
admiration what was intended for ridicule.
High Church dignitaries—Cardinal Mas-
king amongst them—strove their utmost to
make the prohibition perpetual, and, by
their arguments in high-class magazines,
considerably improved Europe’s digestion
by increasing its mirth. Mill, who sat for
Westminster, dealt Theism far more vigor-
ous blows than Bradlaugh did, but—
he avoided the subject of perpetual pen-
sions. And now that the curtain has at
length gone down on the [impudent’ farce*
colonial Conservative journals discover that
the member for Northampton’s “bump-
tiousness ” was the cause of his long ostra-
cism. To exclude men, then, on account of
their opinions from legislative bodies, which
are supposed to be a reflex of the nation, we
consider a flagrant injustice, while to give
free admission to those who have made use
of their position for the purpose of private
gain runs counter to every canon of moral
government,
♦ • •
There is a kind of malfeasance which,
wjiile not prompted by selfish or sordid
motives, is yet inimical to the public weal.
It is when men temporarily at the head of
affairs take upon themselves to act as if in
obedience to a direct mandate from Parlia-
ment. We have lately had many illustra-
tions of this description of wrong-doing.
When Mr. Dibbs or Sir John Robert-
son sanction the paying away of hun-
dreds of thousands without Parliament-
ary permission, and trust to Providence
to obviate the necessity for fresh tax-
ation, the thought suggests itself to seri-
ous men that, in less scrupulous lands,
such extensive powers might be used in a
manner detrimental to the general well-
being. As a correspondent rather sensibly
remarks:—“ln the good old times, when a
shepherd took a flock of sheep, they were
counted to him, and when he gave them up
they were counted again. If there were
any missing which he could not satisfac-
torily account for he had to pay for them."
It might be difficult to apply this principle
to men who light-heartedly transfer a bal-
ance from the right to the wrong side of the
national ledger, and, while clinging tena-
ciously to office, passionately reject the
necessity for fresh taxation to balance the
accounts. There appears to be no real sense of
responsibility. Parliament meets, condemns
its steward, replaces him with another, and
there the matter ends. The late steward,
instead of being brought to book, changes
his seat, and bides his time for a fresh oppor-
tunity to show the public what a master he
is of finance. Time was when his financial
experiments would have led to the incon-
venience of his parting at one stroke with
his post and his head. Later still the cum-
brous process of impeachment would have
taught him—if he survived it—and his suc-
cessors, that the concision of credit into

flebit balances was a hazardous occupation,
Conducive neither to comfort nor longevity.
But the most conspicuous instance of this
pattern of ill-doing was afforded by Mr.
□alley in his historical offer of disciplined
troops, which he did not possess* for sex Vice
ih a broil which did not concern him.
Here was the ease of a man, whose
seat in a non-elective body was secure,
committing the colony to a course of action
which, but for a combination of purely
fortuitous circumstances, might have cost
thousands of lives and millions of money.
It is not due to his foresight that Australian
troops are not now rotting in Khartoum, or
snowed up in Afghan passes. Swayed by a
bastard Imperialism, he, without consulting
Parliament, pledged New South Wales to a
policy from which retreat was but a shade
leas dishonourable than advance. No more
melancholy sight do we remember than the
departure of those ill-trained men to help
in suppressing the rising of a wretched
people against a cruel despotism. And to
think of the prominent Churchmen—fol-
lowers of the Prince of Peace—who came
forward with prayers and blessings to help
the awkward rabble on their merciless mis-
sion! The anniversary of their departure
should be kept in the colony as one of hu-
miliation and prayer. Surely the time has
come for the people of New South Wales
to say resolutely “ Those who dissipate our
savings, pledge our honour, or risk our lives
without consulting our chosen representa-
tives, will do so at their peril.”
* * *
To come to the point: there is at present
no ready method by which either Parlia-
ment or the people can visit malfeasance in
office with real, effectual punishment. Ex-
pulsion from the Legislature is a disgrace,
truly, but the sting is taken from the humr
liation, when the sense of the public per-
ceives that among the expellers are some
persons who have on other occasions or in
different respects merited punishment quite
as much as the expelled persons. Besides,
expulsion is a dangerous weapon, as we have
already indicated, liable to abuse, on the
one hand, and to nullification on the other,
a single constituency being able, for per-
haps the most sordid of local reasons, to
neutralise the action of the representative
Chamber by re-electing the ejected mem-
ber. What is required is a method or
real punishment, a machinery easily
put in motion, effective when sat to work,
and vested with powers to inflict punish-
ments equal in severity to the gravity
of the offences to be dealt with. Instead of
the, too often, farce of expulsion, there
should be available, and readily available,
real penalties, and Ministers or members
who may feel disposed to abuse their trusts,
barter away their influence, or violate the
Constitution and betray their country into
irreparable false policy, should have ever
before their eyes the real terrors of
pecuniary personal liability and the felon’s
cell.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Hour and the Man.
Sib John Robertson's colleagues must have felt
highly honoured the other evening when they
heard him state that he had offered office to no less
than ten gentlemen, who, for various reasons,
declined the honour, and that the only thing
which induced him to entertain the idea of making
any further attempt to get a team together was
assurance given by the ten gentlemen that he had
their sympathy, and that it was their intention to
give the Government their “ cordial support ”
Sir Henry Pabkes showed his sympathy on the
following night by making a vigorous speech
against the Government. He strongly condemned
them, and recorded his vote against a motion
proposed by Sir John, the negativing of which
would have meant the retirement of the Govern-
ment from office. Two other of the alleged “ cor-
dial supporters ” —Messrs. Foster and Suitor
also voted against the motion. Promises of cor-
dial support are never given unconditionally by
men of Sir Henry Pahkes’ calibre. Such an idea
could never have arisen in Sir John Robertson’s
brain in the days of his intellectual vigour. Con-
ceive Sir Henry Pahkes or any other leading
politician promising “ cordial support ” to a Minis-
try still unformed, and to a policy yet in the womb
of time 1 The entire tendency of political affairs
at the present time points to the probability
that the Voice of the country will before very long
demand that Sir Henry Parkes shall resume the
helm of State, as the only available pilot who has
strength, skill, and experience to extricate the
ship from the breakers inro which it has been per-
mitted to drift. Necessity knows no law. The
condition of the finances will permit of no further
long-continued dabbling. It is not at moments of
danger that novices and amateurs can be per-
mitted to try tneir hands and play at experimental
politics. The hour has come, some time ago. The
colonists of New South Wales have been looking
expectantly for the man— the new, young, strong,
man—and he has not made his appearance. Mr,
Dibbs has made himself impossible, Mr. Abbott
has failed yet to sufficiently impress the commu-
nity with the comprehensiveness of his abilities,
although he may hereafter develop political con-
ceptions of a more liberal tendency than have been
indicated in hi? most recent utterances. A
little time ago considerable expectation cen-
tered upon the Speaker, hut he has not
risen to the occasion, and now the idea
of Mr. Barton descending from the chair and
saving the country by an application of the wizard
oil of uniform suavity and invariable courtesy
can only excite a smile, Sir John Robertson,
dribbling petulant complaints about “the exe-
crable Press,” and ottering squatters a bribe of
deferred millions to induce them to supply tem-
porary thousands, has already compromised his
Ministry of odds-and-ends past retrieval. It seems
little use repining. The country must accept its
only remaining alternative •with the best grace it
can.

“ Bigotry and Bo;ks.”
On the 9th January of this year we, in an article
in this paper under the above heading, called
attention to the fact that works of fiction were
| issued from the Sydney Free Library “on week
days only,” and stated that we feared this to be
the result of Cbadbandism working in an under-
hand manner to defeat the will of Parliament as
expressed by specific motion. On the 28th ult. Mr.
HenuV Copeland, from his place in Parliament,
interrogated the Minister for Public Instruction as
to the truth of these assertions, and was Informed
that the resolution of “March, 1878, lnclude
the lending branch, which was opened on the
order of the Minister for Justice.” This reply
must have startled Mr. Copeland, who was one of
the majority in the division of 19 to 12, by which
the motion was carried. Its terms were—“ That In
the opinion of this House It Is desirable, in the
Inter-ests of Society generally, to open the Free
Public Library and Museums on Sundays.” Now,
as the lending branch of the Free Library is a part
only of the whole Library, as is further shown by
the fact that officials at the reading branch may he
called upon for duty at the lending room, it is
manifest that the Free Library could not be
deemed open to the public if that branch were
closed. Therefore we confess our complete
inability to discover why it was necessary
for the Minister for Justice to act unless under
the compulsion of this order of the House.
But from the reply of the astute Young
it would appear that, after this order was made’
the trustees over-rode the action of the Minister,
and limited the number of hooks issued by refus-
ing to allow works of fiction, which the Ministers
assert comprise the majority of books borrowed’
to go out. We don't know who these trustees
are, but we do know that when it was proposed to
add some French books to the catalogue one of
these learned bibliopoles sapiently remarked, “Oh>
be hanged to them foreign books; let’s have trans-
lations. What’s the use of hooks that no one can
read?” Theymay.be excellent men, and this
anecdote shows how eminently qualified some of
them are for their positions, but we would like
to know what powers they possess, and the degree
of their accountability. It is necessary to sum up
the progress of this Sunday question that we may
see how the present state of affairs has been
evolved. Parliament, by motion, ordered the
opening of the Library; the Minister of Justice,
it is affirmed, opened it on Ms own motion; then
the trustees closed more than half the shelves, and
the Minister for Education explains why this has
been done. The masterly stratagem of the trustees
deserves ample recognition. la the Gospel ac-
cording to Young we read that they, “wishing
to discourage the excessive issue of prose fiction,”
decided not to issue novels on Sunday I Such
a stroke of policy would seem to bear the
imprint of genius if we did not know that
there is not the slightest effort made to
lessen the number given out on the other six
days of the week. We would suggest to these
superlative strategists that they should limit the
issue of—say, works of jurisprudence, by refusing
to allow them to be borrowed on the 29th of Feb-
ruary in each year. That would be on a par with
their action in this instance. It is hardly possible
to suppose that these trustees are as childishly
simple as Mr. Young’s answer would lead us to
infer, hut the only other explanation must be
based on the assumption that the Minister by this
answer has issued “a prose work of fiction” to
the House. One other point in the Ministerial re"
ply deserves notice, and that is the contemptible
pandering to the lower classes evinced by the state-
ment that the issue of works of prose fiction
was stopped because two-thirds of the books were
borrowed “ by boys and girls of the upper
classes.” There is ample reason for doubting this
stnßbnt: boys and girls of what are generally
spokfn of as the upper classes buy their novels,
and do not borrow them from a vuigah library
where the common people get hooks. Even if
they did, they would get them on a week day, for
they have then the opportunity which is denied
to the manual labour class, for whose sake we
desire to see these shelves opened on Sunday.
It was for the sake of those who cannot
afford to keep a library of their own that
Free Libraries were established, hut if we be-
lieve Mr. Young it is the wrong class of people
who use the hooks. We are inclined to think that
the Minister, in making this reply, has been
entirely misled, and we think it a less censure
upon the authorities generally to entirely disbe-
lieve the whole explanation than to accept it as
true. If, for instance, one-third of the borrowers
are only such “ oa sufferance—being children under
age ”_it is plain enough either that the rule which
prohibits such from borrowing is useless and
obsolete, or else that the officials are to blame for
allowing regulations to he broken by so large a
percentage of borrowers. For the sake of the
trustees and the officials generally, against whom
the suspicion of narrow-minded bigotry has by this
reply by Mr. Young been raised, we hope that Mr.
Copeland will go a step further and insist upon a
full and true explanation of the whole situation.
The fact remains that the will of Parliament has
been thwarted; it is necessary to discover by whom
and for what purpose this has been done.

Federation and Independence.
To us, who have always looked towards Federa-
tion as a stop In the direction of Australian
National Autonomy, it cannot fall to be gratifying
that the first assemblage of a federal nature should
have afforded occasion for a public utterance of
the aspirations of Australian patriotism. The
speech of the venerable Premier of Tasmania fills
us with as much joy as it has overwhelmed some
of our contemporaries with dismay and confusion.
Nothing could have been more unforseon. ffh«
delegates were presumed, judging by the experi-
ence of past events—the annexation of Fiji, for
example—to he all on their best conventional he-
haviour, expectant and solicitous of participation
in the shower of titular distinctions which
generally sprinkles the participants in an
event of this kind. Consequently, nothing save
adulation of their betters (in Engiand) and ex-
pressions of meek contentment with the depen-
dent station in life which Providence has been
pleased to bestow upon these “ dependencies,”
were looked for from the delegates. The public
of Australia has long been accustomed to recog-
nise as the most humble trucklers to our “ su-
periors ” in England the most prominent of our
public men. Plain colonists might speak their
minds without heed of consequences, but Minis-
ters of the Crown could only declare themselves
Australians first and British immigrants in a
secondary sense at the risk of forfeiting their
chances of a star, a bit of ribbon, and a handle to
their names. Mr. Douglas, the veteran Premier
of Tasmania, has spurned these potent considera-
tions. He spoke like a statesman, where all where
expected to drivel like courtiers and fawn like
spaniels. Mr. Griffith, of Queensland, a
knight-expectant, who la about due for the
distinction, dodged all round the momen-
tous question raised by the old states-
man’s bluff and pregnant utterance with a
pitiful dexerity of commonplace. The state-
ments made by Mr. Douglas were that, in the
case of England being engaged in a Euro-
pean war, the States of Australia would neces-
sarily consider the disadvantages of the Imperial
connection, and that, apart from such a stimulus
to a desire for independence, the natural growth
of these communities must, in due course, indis-
pose them to their present position of subordina-
tion, dependency, and political inferiority. We
have pointed the same morals so frequently that
we need scarcely reiterate the reasonings with
which our readers are familiar, and we may pass
with a smile over the puerile efforts of the Jingo
Press to minimise the significance of the veteran
colonist’s declaration. These colonies are no
longer mere congeries of expatriated Britons j
And every year Increases the population of native
born Australians. The time is already past when
to the people of Australia the term of mother
country, as applied to.the little islands on the other
side of the world, carries with it any sentimental
value, or beats the ring of a truthful epithet. To
a large proportion of the Australians of to-day,
Australia is their mother country, and England is
regarded in the remoter relationship of the grand-
mother country.
*
Law Makers and Law Breakers.
If our leading politicians fail to secure worthy
distinction for their efforts in the way of law-
making, it certainly cannot be said that they are
not worthy of condemnation for their efforts at
law-breaking, as three succeeding New South
Wales Governments have been guilty of violent
inroads on the Constitution and absolute defiance
of Statute law. One of the fundamental prin-
ciples of the Constitution is that Parliament shall
have complete control over all public expenditure;
and the Audit Act distinctly provides that no
money shall be paid out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund without the sanction of Parliament.
The necessity of this principle is obvious, but
the Stuart, Dibbs and Robertson Governments
have totally disregarded it. Finding themselves
short of money to meet engagements, they have
adopted the convenient, but illegal, method of
transferring money from the general fund to that
fruitful source of corruption, the Treasurer’s
advance account. Within the last eight weeks
no less a sum than £250,000 has been made available
in this way. To what services this money has
been devoted Parliament is not even aware. Mem-
bers were told the other night that the money
had been paid away, and therefore it would
have to be voted, and it is surprising to
learn that no member thought it his duty
to demand a statement giving the items.
There was some slight murmuring against
the practice, but the occasion was one which de-
manded, if not positive repudiation, at any rate a
distinct avowal that any similar breach of the law
would not be approved of, and that the ptrpe.
trators of the misdeed would meet with condign
punishment. The worst offender, as far as i*
known at present, is Mr. Dibbs, because he took
the necessary official action to get a sum of money
transferred while Parliament was sitting. That
gentleman must have been very hard pushed for a
reason to j ustify such an exceedingly dangerous
violation of the suirit of the Constitution and of
Statute law when he penned this:—“ This arrange-
ment will obviate the necessity of asking the nine
associated banks to make advances on the
personal guarantee of the Government, for which
nine separate accounts would have to be opened.”
Does Mr. Dibbs think that the public are so stupid
as to suppose for a moment that the nine asso-
dated banks would advance his or the present
Government £50,000 on their personal guarantee?
We imagine that, under the circumstances, the
banks would require [something safer than p.n.s—
we know that some of our politicians have a par-
ticular fancy for attaching their signatures to
such documents, and if rumour be true the only
value of them is such as attaches to the signatures
as the autographs of distinguished persons. The
danger of the practice is aptly Illustrated in Mr.
Dibbs’ case. When he found that engagements
had been entered into, and that Parliament had net
provided the funds meet them, his clear duty
was to have sought the necessary appropriation.
But this would havo been highly inconvenient
for him, as he would have been forced to declare
the state of the finances sooner than he did. Thus
it will be seen that a corrupt Government might
make the course smooth for retention of office for
a considerable length of time, and leave their
successors a legacy of unauthorised expenditure
for which they would have to got the sanction of
Parliament. If the events of the last year or so
are to be accepted as precedents, responsible
government will soon be divested of all its re-
ponsibility.
Ireland and the "Echo.”
It is on Irish questions that the Sydney Echo is at
its best. It is when it boldly vaults into the ring
to tackle matters which have puzzled Froudb
and Leckey, that it shows an inspired talent for
supporting the wrong side of a subject, concerning
both sides of which it is quite in the dark. Hear
, it upon Dr, O’Dohbrty s last speech:—“The
Dr., tells us that all Ireland wants and has wanted
is to be just in the position of a British colons
But would the people of New South Wales waat«
separate Legislature if they were as close m
England as Ireland is ? If we could be represented
at Westminster as conveniently as Ireland can
our aspiring politicians would rather be members
of the House of Commons than of a smaller
colonial legislature. Algeria is separated frorn
France by a larger stretch of water than
Channel, vet Algeria is represented in the Parlia-
mentjof France. Corsica is an island, and is farther
from Paris than Dublin is from London, but Cor
Sica is simply a department of France.” A little
over 30 years ago the people of the southern por-
tion of New South Wales demanded a national
life of their own, or, in other words, separation
from the mother colony. They were nearer to the
latter than Ireland to England—indeed, were only
separated by a river and a line as imaginary as a
meridian. Had the opinion of the New South
Wales authorities been considered final, Victoria
would still be sending representatives to Sydney
unless by means of a successful rebellion she had
managed to secure separation. Some years later
the people of Moreton Bay decided on setting up
housekeeping. Their territory also was coter-
minous with that of New South Wales,
But, all the same, they asked for and ob-'
tained political independence —so far as New
South Wales was concerned. Thus we see
the] whole of Eastern Australia occupied by
three flourishing hut mutually-independent colo-
nies, with a prospect of a fourth being created by
the division of the youngest. Yet these settle-
ment? had no old racial or religious grievances
to divide them. It can scarcely he denied that
both Victoria and Queensland would be far less
vigorous and prosperous to-day if they were still
governed from Sydney. We submit that, with
such examples before them of the benefits of local
government, the Australian who would deny
Home Eule to Ireland, adopts prejudice, not
reason, for a guide. Every argument in favour cf
Victorian local government is strengthened when
applied to Ireland. Take America again, or
Canada, or South Africa. There we see precisely
the same plan of local administration at work with
the same gratifying results. If a Parliament is to
be denied Dublin because Algeria and Corsica are
governed from Paris, then the local assemblies
of the United States and of the various colonies
are mistakes. When, therefore, the Echo con-
demns Irish Home Rule, it might, if only out of
compliment to its limited circle of readers, obtain
some elementary work on the subject, and not so
persistently occupy the role of the blind leading
the blind.
A Sham Moral.
To reading the Pall Mall disclosures, Mrs.
Hampton and her daughters assign their deter-
mination to make away with themselves. So the
Australasian breaks out with“ Had not the
foul, false, a id malignant trash originally pub-
lished by Mr. Stead in the Pall Mall Gazette
been reproduced here by some newspapers, the
probability is that Mrs. Hampton and her
daughters would never have read it, or found
themselves in the terrible position they now
occupy.” In every community there Is a certain
proportion of weak-minded persons who are
always within measurable distance of madness.
Any occurrence out of the common will drive
them across the boundary line. More especially is
this the case when their mental tendencies
are in the direction of melancholia. These
people read of a peculiar murder or suicide
-of the suffering endured by a boat’s
crew adrift in mid-ocean, or of a child’s being
kidnapped for the sake of gain, and they are no
longer sane. Like the person, who, looking from
a high cliff, is seized with a desire to launch him-
self into the void beneath, they become possessed
of a morbid craving to emulate the doings or
adventures of which they have read. Thus we
sometimes have suicides and murders—not singly,
but in battalions’ If public information is to be
suppressed, and public abominations suffered to
flourish lest unevenly-balanced minds become un-
hinged, the invention of the printing press was a
mistake. Much the Australasian or journals of
its class cares if Mrs. Hampton and her mis-
guided daughters murdered a whole street. Mr.
Stead's unpardonable offence was the bull’s-eye
thrown by him on the bestiality of the rich. It Is
not nice f o be told that the person vou worship is a
mere vulgar blackguard after all-one to whom
you could not introduce your wife or daughter un-
less you considered their seduction an honour.
Stead s “fou 1 , false, and malignant trash ” is un-
happily too true. The colonial journalist who
whines at the immorality and brutality of the
larrikin is always ready to daub with mud the
fearless worker who exposes the ruffianism of the
titled. Long after the Australasian writer has
been relieves of all his mundane bigotry of caste
and class prejudices the name of “ Stead ” will he
remembered with gratitude by millions of pure-
minded Englishmen as yet unborn.
With respect to a paragraph in our last Issue, in
which reference was made to a current and
generally believed report that the trustees under
the will of the late Sir G. Wigbam Allen were
putting pressure upon a leading politician in the
matter of promissory notes to the amount of
£BOOO or £9OOO, alleged to have been found among
the deceased knight’s papers, we have explicit
information that no such notes are in exist-
ence, and, consequently, that the inferences
drawn from the reported circumstances are un-
tenable. The report had a wide currency, and
while we regarded it as beneficial to give such
publicity as would load to a clearing up one way
or other, it is peculiarly gratifyii g to be able to
announce that, while there is a L undation in the
fact th?t SirlG. Wigbam Allen had.made advanc' 8
ou mortgage on Sir Henry Pavkbs’ Falconbrldgy
Estate, the transaction was of the ordinary busi-
ness sort, effected in the light of day, and the con-
sideration entirely of a commercial, and not of a
political kind.

A butcher, at Maryborough (Q.), named
lavas has been fined £1 for kissing a customer.
Poor Javas, the fine was nothing, but it was when
got home from the court the trouble com-
menced. He told the hoys afterwards he had
fallen into a thrashing-machine, and they—laid
their forefingers on one edge of their Roman noses

entire satisfaction with his statement....“ Here,

attained perfection in France. This is a transla-
tion from a Parisian journal:—“ The news given
in our columns that a cook-maid at Versailles had
blown out her brains for levels contradicted, in so
far that the occurrence did not take place at Ver-
sailles but at Melun; also that it was not a woman
but a dragoon, and it was not from love but during
an attack ef brain fever; that he did not blow out
his brains, but hanged himself. With those ex-
ceptions, the account was perfectly correct.”
This pleasant little parable is quoted by the S F.
Argonaut:—“ Have you lived a good life ?” said
St. Peter to a trembling female who knocked
timidly at the Gate of Beauty. " I was only good
at one thing,” said the sprite before him, with a
doleful shake of the head. “ And what was that ?”
inquired St. Peter, in a voice of blissful sweet-
ness. “ Cooking,” responded the timid one, in
woeful tones. “ Come right in, then,” said the
sentinel saint; “ you’ve saved more men from
perdition than a doge a missionaries; and I don't
believe you can find anything around here in the
ghape of blessedness that you’re not entitled to.”

the States at the age of 116, called for her pipe just

The late Coburg tragedy furnishes a
warning to husbands. Deprive a woman of decent
clothing, and she usually takes to drink or to
religion—sometimes both. When her religion
takes the melancholy form, she either kills the
baby, hangs herself in the fowl-house, or else
beats the old man’s brains out with the coal-axe
while he is asleep. This poor Coburg woman,
having “ got religion,” and being off her head,
took the head off her daughter. Now, if her hus-
band had only provided her with a pair of high-leg
boots, and a white hat with a curly feather all
round it, she would have been able to sit out the
service at church without hearing a word that
was said. Instead of that, as her own garments
were notoriously dowdy, she wore her brain out
with envy, and then naturally enough got a bad
attack of religion, culminating in murder. Hus-

The Severed Hand mystery still puazles
the wits of JM.Z. detectives. Mr. Arthur Howarde,
whose clothes were found on Sumner Beach and
whose widow went into mourning and demanded
£34QO from the Insurance companies, has been dis-
covered in the flesh and in disguise at Petonl near
Wellington, where he was arrested and remanded
to Cnristchurcti. Mrs. Howarde was also arrested
together with two brothers named Godfrey, who
discovered the severed hand on the beacn. One
of the Godfreys was an attendant at a lunatic
asylum, and It was thought the hand might have
been taken from the body of a patient who had
recently died. The corpse, however, on being
exhumed, was found to be double-fisted and
intact. Then the detectives scented some-
thing farther afield. An old lady had shuffled
off at Masterton, in the North Island, where it was
known Howarde had been at the time. Her rela-
tives, on being shown a photo, of the hand,
thought it resembled the weapon she used to
slipper them with in their early days, Th® under-
taker remembered that some stranger had
hovered about the scene op. funeral day. The
cexton was certain some one had been using a
spkde about her grave after he had done with it.
The old Jady consequently was resurrected, but
found to be all there—nothing missing—much to
the disgust !of the corpse-diggers. And now the
N.Z. detectives want very much to know who to
dig up next. Any fresh-looking corpse which
finds Itself minus a hand will he handsomely re-
warded on applying personally at the nearest
police office in N.Z. N.Z. papers please copy.
Robert Browning, D.C.L.
Robert Browning, poet and t dramatist, whose
writings are less read than their merits deserve,
was born at Camberwell, Surrey, England, and
completed his education at the University of Lon-
don. In 1835, when he was but 33, he published
“ Pauline ” and “ Paracelsus,” poems which did
not gain him very much celebrity; nor was his
“Strafford,” produced on a London stage, in 1837,
much more successful; and It was not until the
publication of the hook of dramatic and lyrie
poems, to which he gave the name of “ Bells and
Pomegranates,” in 1843, that his power and origin-
ality of mind earned anything like a fair measure
of appreciation. Since that time he has been pro-
lific of poetry, very few years having passed with-
out thel presentation of a volume from his
pen. His lack of popularity may perhaps he
chiefly ascribed to the fact that many of his poems
are enigmatical and involved beyond the power
of comprehension, and the student, baffled in the
study of these, disdains to notice or read the
many beautiful poems which abound in his
volumes. Mr. Browning was married in 1846 tos
Miss Elizabeth Barrett, who retained her surname
with the addition of his, hut she died in 1861. Mr.
Browning is a devoted student of music and paint-
ing, and deeply read in the science of each of
these arts. He is also an accomplished linguist,
and speaks several of the modern as well as the
dead languages with scholarly fluency.
A story about an Australian journalist is
going the rounds of London papers. It must sur-
prise the home Journalists, and all journalists,
to read the stuff thus printed and circulated. It
is that this colonial newspaper man has his clothes
made by London tailors and sent out three suits
at a time 1 Also that the last consignment arrived
in Australia with only one waistcoat left in the
box. Also that said j ournalist of the three suits
is on a Protectionist paper, and writes strongly on
protecting colonial industry. We have inquired
into the truth of this story, and find that the
journalist’s brother is a tailor who should remit
some money left the pair by a deceased relative.
Not believing in “ parting ” he adopted the clothes
dodge. It is thought that the Custom House
officials may explain about the short delivery
made. The temptation offered by three suitsof
London-made clothes would be very strong to
many young men in the Civil Service. Robbing a
I journalist would be but as a pleasant revenge with
I most of them.
Thus the Echo '“ Poets get Jess con-
sideration than any other artists, and the term is
infinitely more deserved by them than any other
section of the community to which it is ordinarl ly
applied. Mr. P. J. Holdsworth certainly deserved
a warmer recognition of the merits of his ode than
he got.” We do not purpose to find fault with
either the truth or literary merit of this clipping;
we merely use it to point out the inconsistence of
the paper from which it was taken. Previous to
the appearance of this a letter appeared in the
Echo signed “Dryden Keats Tupper,” evidently
intended as a satire on the “ Welcome Ode,” and
giving P. J. H. some nasty jars. After doing
all that was possible in an anonymous way pre-
vious to the performance, to prevent people
applauding the Ode, after it is over the Echo
rushes forward to express its regret that the poet
did not receive the recognition due to his talent
and his labour. This is on a footing with the con-
sistency of a man who, after wilfully knocking a
helpless stranger down, rushes to pick him upland
brushing the dust from his garments, proceeds to
sympathise with him over his black eye.
One of Lord Tennyson’s last efforts is a
poem in Irish dialect. In his old and decorated
age, the Laureate has developed a versatility of
which be has so far been unsuspected, The story
is founded on a thin old romance of the Ballina.
sloe bogs, in which Danny O’Boon, going home
charged with whisky and sentimentality, steps
into the bog and disappears from the vulgar gaze
for forty years. At the expiration of that period
some peat-diggers gouge out the “ corp,” which is
identified by Molly Magee, his first and only love.
The jury subsequently decided that Danny came
to bis death by falling off a horse, and Molly, at
the conclusion of the inquest, falls dead across the
waterlogged body of Danny. The grave is digged
deep enough to hold both. Danny and Molly are
“ planted,” to blossom two roses, on a single stem
in the floriculture of the future. There is a good
deal of poetical license taken by the bard, who has j
gone to much trouble to perpetrate Irishisms,
which in the thirteenth verse are abundant.—
“Och, Molly, we thought, machree, ye would start
back agin into life,
Whin we laid yez, aich be aioh, at yer wake like
husband and wife.

An’ Shamus O’Shea that has now ten chllder,

thim all.
“Thin his Eiverenee burled thim both In wan grave
be the dead boor-tree,
The young man Danny O’Roon wid his ould
woman, Molly Magee.”
Shamus O’Shea was the faithful lover who waited
long years for Molly and didn’t get her. Tiring of
his bootless pursuit he wedded another, and pre-
sented 10 taxpayers or landlord extinguishers to
the State. The poem is Tennysonlan. Let us
warble five verses in a Tennysonlan strain—
Young Dlnnls Molloy had a hand like a fut, and
an eye of blue,
And a mouth like a cut in a “Murphy,” ’twas
slightly ashkew;
He was bowed in his legs, and club-futted in both
av his feet,
But in other rishpicfs he was daeent enough,
troth Dlnny was shweet.
And Kitty, the girl that he loved, she was Hvin
below at the mill,
Where her father brew’d potheen (pure whiaky)
In a quiet, shnug little still,
And often they shwallowed the mixhture, and
dhtank till the morn—
Yor Dinny was happy near Kitty, though she
looked on him wid scorn.
Wan evenin’ when Dinny was dhrinkin’, and
Bingin’ a song av the Green,
His Molly popped into the wurrum a beaker of
kerosene,
And Dinny dhi’ank deep of the mixhture, and
shkipped to the shore.
Where St. Patrick, wid angels and whisky, now
dwells evermore.
Then Molly shllpped close to his whiskers a bit iv
a lucifer match,
And held the flame there till the light on the
shpirit could catch;
Wihin his bright soul had gone to St. Patrick, and
his body was duly cremated,
Molly ehwept all the ashes to Giendalough’s edge
and forthwith emigrated.
And often she laughed in her self-imposed exile
at Dinny Molloy’s disappearance;
And smiled when she thought of the plan she’d
adopted to give him his clearance.
But her laugh was as loud as the howl of an ill-
advised crowd’s insurrection,
Whin she thought of the throuble they’d have wid
his case at the Restriction.

Lord Tollemache is in his 80th year and is
a Tory of the Tories. He is, however, a living
proof that a man may be better than the creed,
political or religious, which he professes. Lord
Tollemache owns 4<i 000 acres of land in Cheshire.
Years ego he divided it into farms, the largest; nqt
over 200 acres. tTpon tffise he spent £148.000 in
bunding farm houses He built besides 200 cot
taees for labourer . He also built half a dozen
schools, a. notable thing arose in connection with
the schools. The farmers declined to send their
children to schools frequented by labourers’ chil-
dren Lord Tollemache solved the difficulty by
sending his own sons to the schools for two years.
The old man is still hale, and is now quite jubilant
that his party is in power, for he believes that

Paradise.
Grisi and Mario were the great singers by
whom our fathers swore. Like Patti and Nicollnl,
they had allied themselves for what the French
call “convenience.” Borne little Grisettes or
Marionettes were the net, or gross, result of this
nartnership. Both of the great singers have now
nassed away to where, if we understand heavenly
occupations, their singing will elevate them much
above the crowd less musically endowed. Their
souls will not, therefore, be vexed, as they would
have been here below, by what has happened to
their eldest born. This sweet child of song spends
most of her time In swindling. She has just re-
ceived a sentence of a year’s imprisonment on
some 40 charges ol embezzlement brought against
her If “one sad lolsel soils a name tor aye.” as
Bvron sings, then what amount of soiling must
not 40 “ loisels ” do for the name of one who does
them.
The evil results of a parcel of “well

TdPtv their behaviour was very similar to that ol
certain old maids in “ Don Juao,” who shut them-
BPlvesup in a church (if we remember rightly)
when the city was attacked. The Hampton fe-
males indulged in very similar speculations. It is
ncsitively sickening to read of girls rising from
their knees with the conviction that either they
would have to allow themselves to be led astray or
they l must die.” And it was the poor little child of
eight years of age, by the bye, who decided that
they ought to die The elder girls prayed earn-
estly and for a time no answer seemed to come.
Now they are persuaded that they are not to die.

Now that Wendel Phillips has “stepped
out,” the “wretched Press” Is raking up the
usual collection of anecdotes illustrative of his
sound sense and keen, sarcastic wit. The hulk or
them are probably ims, but true or not, the toi-
lowing tale is good. Phillips was trotting over to
the New York Central one day, when a rather
pompous, well-fed looking clergyman approached
him and asked, “Sir, what is your aim in lire t
To which the senator bluntly replied: lo bene-
fit the negro.” “ Ah,” returned the Gospel sharp,
“well, why don’t you go down South and do it ?
“ That’s worth thinking about,” answered Phillips,
as if the thought had never struck him before;
“ but I notice you wear a rather white necktie,
therefore, I would like to ask what is jyour parti-
cular aim in life.” “To save souls from hell, my
friend,” groaned the paruon. “Is that so, re-
torted Phillips; “then, why don’t you go down to
hell and do it?” This closed the conversation.
Mr. Streeter, of old Bond-street and High
Holborn, jeweller, is doing a large trade in Aus-
tralian produo 3. And whom Mr atreeter is may
as well be explained. He has succeeded to the
jewellery business of Mr. Harry Emanuel, who
succeeded to that of Hunt and Roakell. Mr,
Emanuel is now, under the French title of a Count,
a resident of Pans, retired from trade and doing
the lofty. Mr. Streeter’s smlis in trade and noth-
ing else. He sends his sons out to put £lO 0.0 into
the Australian pearl-fishing business. The interior
of these pearl-shells produces that mother-of-
pearl” which has quite eclipsed ivory for kmle-
handles and other ornamental work. Mr. Streeter s
pearl-shell fishings are on the coasts of Western
and Northern Australia, whence he receives many
tons monthly. The pearls reach him per mail
steamers in registered packages. ... hese salt-water
diggings are as profitable to him as any gold or
silver ones and a little more so than many ot tnose
ventures.
Metzger, the world-famed Dutch doctor,
who is now patching up the corporeal system of
Pope Leo XIH.. began life, like the “fnnd av
Wiatworth an* X)illnillay^ ,, as abutchors boy, ana
the bulk of bis medic U acquirements seem to
have been gathered almost entirely by personal
observation in the shambles which gave him his
marvellous acquaintance with the various muscles.
He was 40 years ot age before ne seriously took
to study, but he had no trouble In rapidly rushing
to the front rank of the medical profession, iwo
years ago he had the Empress of Austria, the
Queen of Sweden, and our own Mr. Wales under
his care, and as Alfred would say, “gave pleasure
to all.” As a rule, his patients have to visit him,
but in the case of the Pope the mountain went to
Mahomet. Tne tranformation from a butcher to
a doctor is rather suggestive, aud recalls Martial a
pithy epigram—
“ Doctor Diaulus is an undertaker made,
The name is changed, ’tis true, but not tho
trade.”
Dr. J. Marmaduke Rose, M,L.A. for
North Melbourne, was at one time a blacksmith,
aad is nos? a medico. But u© is something more
he is a lay pieacher and an intensely religious man.
Not long since we went to bis Church In Hot ham
(Vic.) and heard Dr. Hose’s pulpit address. When
we hoar i him we had no difficulty in understand-
ing why the Hothamites sent him to I arliament.
Down South all good holv men make their way
into the Legislature. Owing to the confused state
of political parties in Victoria just now, Dr. Hose
thinks he ought to be to the front, and the other
day ho called a meeting to enunciate a new
Liberal policy. One of the planks ot his platform
was “ Loyalty to the Crown and Imperial unity.
The Chairman (Mr. J. W. Brown) proposed to add
"That the colony shoo'd have the right to elect
its own Governors.” Tnis was not relished by Dr.
Hose’s psalm-singing crowd, but as there were
evidently some of the audience in tavour of it,
Dr. Hose, in order io humour them, suggested
that they should “ only ask lor the right to nomi-
nate a Governor, subject to the Queen s.anproyal.
However, the proposal was negatived. Wnat sur-
prises us most is that men of the Rose stamp
should get into Parliament under the guise of
Liberals.
The report of the International Committee
in Nice upon the disgraceful gambling hell of
Monte Carlo, which ht s just been issued, is to be
made the ground of a collective diplomatic action
against the protector of that institution, Prince
Charles 111. of Monaco. Tnis important pamphlet
gives a documentary catalogue of a'l the suicides
whlcn nave taken place in Monte Carlo irooa <
to 1885. The total number of persons who pave
destroyed themselves in consequence ot tneir
losses at his Princely Highness’s gaming-tables is
1820—that is to say, tnere have been nearly as
many suicides as the Prince has subjects. It will
be remembered by our readers that this Commis-
sion of Inquiry was inaugurated m direct conse-
auence ot the miserable death of Prince Leopold,
due to the over-excitement of an unlucky,bout at
the tables at Monaco. It is a common saying in
England that railway accidents will never cease
till a director is killed by one. Similarly, it needed
the almost suicide of a royal prince to create a
movement against the Monte Carlo gambling hell,
1820 persons of common eiay had been immolated
bv that pandemonium, when the prince went there
to adifio the eclat and fashion of the place by his
‘‘po|iihage aud presence.”
A#Jl)uncan Gillies, the Victorian Premier
thatisto be, made a terrific speech to his con-
stituents the otner day. We forget hew many
columns long the report of it in the paper was, nut
it was many. He is not a man ot numour-at least
he Is not conscious of it. In the course of the
whole speech he only said one thing tnat raised a
smile uuoa the faces ot his audience. t> Aad that
smile was a sarcastic one *So tar, said he,
sneaking of the recent appointment of Mr.
Kerford as a Judge ot the Supreme Court, as
Mr. Kerford’s qualifications as a lawyer are con-
cerned, I am not a judge, out In regard to his
other qualifications I venture to say that few men
possess them to a greater degree than Mr. J ustice
Kerford.” This is as good as the Saji jg ot that old
English Attorney-General, who, on being asked
whv he had appointed a certain gentleman to a
judgeship, knowing the gentleman in question
knew nothing of law, replied: “He may not know
much of law, but. by Jove! sir, he a a dashed fine
fellow ” We should Jke to know what the other
Qualifications ” which Mr. Gillies alluded to as
being possessed by Mr. Kerferd in such an amaz-
ing degree really are. Are they billiard playing
or whist ? draw-poker or jig dancing ? Mr. Gil-
lies is an advocate ot temperance, or we would
hazard a guess that one of the qualifications he
most admired in Mr. Kerferd was his ability to
pass a judgment on tne merits ot beer.
Among the items of interest in Melbourne
chit-chat is the announcement of the approaching
marriage of Mr. Murray Ross to a daughter of Mr.
GrJham Berry. It is fashionable just now tor ois-
naritv in yeats to distinguish matrimonial
alliances It is nothing, toeretore, out ot the
common that Mr. Murray Ross is of the age of his
intended bride’s father. A man is onlv as old as
he feels, and Mr. Roes in au energetic man ot the
Gladstone type. For long years ho has battled
with adversity in his Russtown Estate. Histwe»ty
odd years managership of the Globe insurance
Company furnished the means for purchase ot the
thousand acres to which this name is given. I hen
followed hts endeavours to start there tbo »eat-
root sugar manufacture wnh a branch railway
from the works to the Government line. ; ihat
purse of nubile men—the want of pence, com-
pelled his mortgaging the estate, lollowed^ shortly
by a sharp-practice sale made by the mortgagees.
This sale was set aside by the Court, and tho pro-
nely restored to Mr. Ross. Sugar manufacture
hung lire from the great fall in the price ot the
article, and the estate—all but 200 acres—had to be
sold to a syndicate at a third of what it would
letch now. The Government have promised to
take tho unfinished railway olf Mr. Ross 8 hauos,
ami when that is done—if none at all—fortune may
smil oh gat n up o n the well-deserved efforts of this
bravVstruggier and well-deserving old colonist.
Mr. Alexander Lawrence, the speculative
clerk who borrowed £9OOO from the City of Mel-
bourne Bink without—as Mr. Coombe, m
King.” would, have said —“ mentlon-on-ing or it,
has taken the opportunity to correct certain mlE-
statements about himself. A Herald reporter
was the recipient of Mr. Lawrence’s confidence.
It appears that someone insinuated that he drank
and lost money on horse-races. Mr. L., with par-
donable pride, told the Herald man that such
a statement was wholly untrue. He had not been
absent a single day through drink, and, as for his
turf investments, though modest in the extreme,
they had positively proved remunerative rather
than otherwise. Mr. Lawrenc?, in fact, had com-
mitted no “ Irregularity ” except in the little mat-
ter of the £9OOO. And. while admitting this short-
coming, Mr. Lawrence, in a true spirit of mag-
nanimity, stated that he had no wish to in any
way reflect upon the management of the bank.
It is really pleasing to find a gentleman who ap-
propriates a handsome sum of money so averse
to laying any blame upon his too confiding em-
ployers. The manager, Mr. Lawrence evidently
considers, suffers quite enough in reflecting upon
the business himself. And really it does seem
strange that a very moderately salaried bank clerk
can carry on a disastrous gambling in mining
shares for two years and a-half without his pecca-
dilloes coming to the ears of some of his many
*• bosses.” How discreet the brokers must have
been!
Somewhere or another wehave read about
an aged female whose one hope in life was that
she might die on her own bed. Now, old James
Hockey, of Adelaide, wasn’t one of that sort, lie
thought of the hereafter. Where he died was of
small moment to James, so long as he had the
price of a good substantial tombstone on his per-
son at the time of his decease. When this poor old
boy was taken to the hospital in a starving condi-
tion, they discovered £9O in his belt. On being
asked why he didn t purchase corn and wine and
oil with his £9O, James faintly explained that he
was saving it all for tombstones for self and two
brothers. How it comes about that he hasn t
fixed up the marble crosses over his brethren is
not quite clear. Perhapi thev’re not dead yet.
No matter—we will not jeer at James. His ambi-
tion to repose beneath a good tombstone proves
him to possess the soul of a C.M.G. But then,
C.M.G.s never require to starve themselves lor
the sake of their monuments, but usually go off
in a full habit of body. If James persists in keep-
ing himself in low condition, he’ll find his mistake
out when the trumpet sounds. Let us warn him:—
Good James, maybe you think it brave
To starve yourself to feed your grave;
But, on the awful day of Doom,
When you are summoned from that tomb,
And have to hump it on your back.
You’ll want for strength, and cry, alack I
And, as you bear that stone to Peter,
You’ll wish you'd been a larger eater.
Mr. Deakin is a fortunate young man.
Fourteen years ago we met him, as a precocious
youth, attending Sunday evening seances at Dr.
Mother wells. He was then an enthusiastic spiritu-
alist, and ready to correspond with any one upon
the subject. Spiritism, then led by Mr. James
Smith, was the fashionable “craze” of the day_
The late Mr. Lament cf Stawell gave his time and
large fortune to its encouragement. Mrs. Jackson
and Mr. Ebenezer Macgeorge so fascinated him
that he left £40,000 to the latter by a will which
his relatives failed to upset, Mr. Macgeorge and
Mrs. Jackson retired from Melbourne on this
legacy, an i live now in Europe—bothering them-
selves very little, it is likely, about spiritualism.
Mr, Deakin went to the bar but has never held a
brief- spiritualism made him acquainted with
Mr Syme of the Age, who helped him into Parlia-
ment for West Bourke. in the election for which
he twice defeated sir Bryan O'Loghlen. He then
married the daughter of that wealthy distiller
and earnest spiritualist, Mr. Hugh Junor Brown.
“ Canniness.” as the Scotch call it, has been Mr.
Deakin’a chlet characteristic. He has made every-
thing a stepping stone to his own advancement.
He made the irrigation question last year an op-
portunity for an American tour at Government
expense, with tbe.addendum of a secretary to write
an account of it. He is now nominated for Chief
Secretary in Graham Berry s place, with Mr. Gillies
as premier. Old politicians like Mirams* Patter-
son, Major Smith, and half-a-dozen others, stare
with surprise at what they call “ the boy’s suc-
ceBB.,,
it is not generally known that ordination
has a potent influence in modifying the ordinary
symptoms ot Intoxication. The Bev. J. J. Band,
vicar of Chieveley, in Berkshire, was charged
before the Christ Church Cathedral chapter of
Oxford, the Bishop of Oxford presiding, with hav-
inir been drunk on two occasions—once while con-
ducting service and delivering the Communion,
la support of the first Mr. Kichard Fisher, church-
warden of Winterbourne; Mr. J. Stuart Hutton,
resident house physician at St. Thomas s Hospital,
who was visiting at Winterbourne last Christmas;
Mr. Clifford, tutor; Mr. John Hatton, parish clerk,
and other parishioners gave evidence to the effect
that on Christmas morning defendant was under
the influence of liquor and unable to walk steadily
ana firmly. He omitted to announce a hymn
usually sung at the beginning of the service. He
read a wrong Psalm. He read the L.tany, which
was unusual on Christmas Day, and said, liaise
up Satan under our feet,” instead of ‘ Cast down
Satan ” He also made other mistakes m the
service. His expression was fooiish, like that ot
a person intoxicated; his voipe was husky, and it
was difficult to understand what he said.
He stuttered, repeated many words, and omitted
the latter part of others. He gave out in
church that there would he Communion, but no
sermon. However, as defendant began reading
the offertory sentences, the congregation com-
menced quitting the church, and no one remained
to communicate. Defendant dropped his speo-
tacles and iett them behind, put on an overcoat
over his cassock, and drove to his house at Chie-
velev The Kev. B. C. Powys, one ot the curates
of tne parish, and Mr. William Fisher, of Bourne-
mouth; formerly a resident at Chieveley. gave
evidence ns to the defendant's drunkenness in the
street at Chieveley on the 15th of April. Mr.
Fisher flatly relused to shake hands with the
defendant owing to his condition. Defendant
walked unsteadily, and had difficulty in getting
through his vicarage gate. The result was an
example of “sticking to a brother judge, which
would have delighted the heart of Sir William
Manning. The Bishop pronounced the second
charge not proved, and declared the first one
“ not inconsistent with the plea that such appear-
ances were due to illness. He, therefore, con-
cluded it to be his duty to dismiss this charge also.
Thus do the righteous triumph over the ungodly.
We’d sooner be a parson charged before a Bishop
with drunkenness than a labourer before a Sydney
Stinendiary. On similar evidence a Sydney lumper
would getfive bob or the option.”
Is it in a mood complimentary or vein
satirical that Captain Everiil has been dubbed the
Australian Stanley ? Let us sura up the achieve-
ments of the two explorers. Stanley went In
search of Livingstone, marching from Zanzibar to
Dili! with a few Arabs and biacktellows, losing
bus only two white companions by death on the
road. Oftentimes he was attacked with fever and
had to cure himself as best he might. His men
Buffered from typuoid lever, small-pox, and nysen-
try. They deserted him, they threatened him;
they were often on the brink of starvation; in
danger of their lives by ferocious tribes of blood-
thirsty cannibals, and yet Stanley was not deterred
nor tempted to turn back from the work allotted
to him He found Livingstone, and a few years
afterwards he went back to Africa to complete
the work of the great explorer. He travelled this
time across the Continent; his three white com-
panions met their late on the road, and he
left as before with his half-civilised Paganzis to
penetrate an unknown terntoiy, a feat which he
successfully accomplished in two years, alter a
toilsome journey by Jand and water, exposed to
such perils and hardships of which the ceadly
lever, the implacable hostility of the cannibal
tribes throiiKU whoso provinces he passed, the
dangers of the mlvhty cataracts and more
treacherous rapids which it was necessary
for him to pass, and the despondent bear-
ing of his followers were the most formidable
ot the troubles he had to combat and overcome.
In addition to all the worry and care thrown upon
his shoulders as lender of this expedition, he was
careful in examining- and taking: note of the
botany and geology of the country through which
he passed, making regular meteorological observa-
tions, and his diary was kept with such scrupulous
minuteness that very little transcription was
necessary before it was placed in the hands of the
publishers. Captain Bverill was away a few
months, he was attended by a doctor, by scientific
observers ana collectors, and experienced bush-
men. The party brought back with them a heap
of what are vulgarly known as “ curios,” and each
member of the expedition kept a diary, which are
to be carefully collated and cooked up by a clever
editor. Of course men like Stanley are not to be
met with twice in a half century. Buoyancy of
temperament and a strength ot purpose which
nothing less powerful than death can dismay or
turn back from the work to be achieved are the
pre-eminent characteristics required in the man
who will achieve the proud distraction of crossing
New Guinea from the Gulf of Papua to its
northern coast.
Here are some traits of Garibaldi— the
only true proved unselfish patriot or modern days,
not even excepting Plain Bill, Bshind-the-Curt«ln-
Dan, or Secret-Despatch-Henniker-Heaton. We
extract from a notice, by Jessie Taylor, in Qua
Corner, an English periodical, to which Mrs.
Besant and Charles Bradlaugh are also contribu-
tors: —“ At Caprera, Garibaldi spentseveral happy,
peaceful years, living in a small white house,
almost hidden by massive rocks of granite. Be-
hind the house was a garden, where Garibaldi de-
lighted to work with hoe and spade. ‘ Planting
trees and watching their growth,’ he once sain,
* seems to me to be true happiness. Peace, after
which the soul hungers—that peace which men
fondly long for in a world to coxne-I can only
enjoy here, far from the bustle and noise of towns ’
He had a strange fancy about flowers and vege-
tables, imagining they could in some dim fashion
suffer and rejoice after the manner of animals.
1 How happy,’ ne said once to a friend, ‘I feel in
Fontamecia (the name of his vineyard) because I
can prop the plants laid low by the wind, tie the
weak to a stick, bind up the wounds of those
whose branches have been broken, and sprinkle
sulphur over those attacked by the mildew.’ Once,
talking with a friend about his vines, he
compared the oidium or vine-disease to the
temporal power of the Pope ; * only,’ he
added, with a sigh, ‘the ruin caused ‘by
one lasts for centuries, the other for years.’
Everyone in that house loved him, and, as tor his
pretty daughter, Teresina, she Idolised him, loving
him, perhaps, all the more ardently because she
bad lost her mother- beautiful, heroic Anita As
for Garibaldi himself, he passed a great part ot
his day in reading books of history, philosophy,
and poetry. He also read the papers daily, ana
wrote his own life and adventures up to the fall of
Rome. From time to time one of his former lieu-
tenants or comrades-in-arms would pay him a visit
at Caprera, and talk with him over dangers shared
and battles fought together. With such a friend
Garabaldi loved to pace up and down his garden
or vineyard talking of all the happy changes that
bad been effected in the condition of Italy of late
years, and speculating as to all the happiness that
might yet be won, not only for Italy, but for all
the world, if men would but strive for It as they
ought. The priests he believed to be great
enemies of Italian liberty, because they kept the
people in ignorance and taught them superstitions
that debased their reason. He had indeed a reli-
gion ot his own—that of doing good and of striv-
ing to bring joy and well-being on the earth. He
believed with Shelly and others that Ignorance,
poverty, crime, disease, tyranny, and all things
foul and evil, might in time be swept off
the face of the earth if men and women
would but work courageously and earnestly
at their destruction. Holding such a faith
as this, there is little wonder that he, the
general, the daring genius of so many victories,
should have grown at last to look on war as a
hateful thing, for he felt that all men, even of
different nationalities, ought to love and help one
anotner as brothers, instead of shedding each
other’s blood like wild beasts. In the year 1870,
when the Prussian army had invaded France, be
fought for a while in aid of the French Republic.
But the waste of human life that he saw then, the
spectacle ot men fighting, not as bis own men had
fought, for their country's liberty, but merely to
satisfy the greed and revenge of their rulers, all
this helped to disgust him with war; and he wrote
to the English newspapers some of the most beau-
tiful, the most thoughtful, letters that have ever
been penned on the subject of peace. War, he
urged, was a survival from barbarous ages, a pur-
suit unfit for civilised men. When two nations
quarrel, why, be argued, should human blood be
shed? Why could not the leading nations of
Europe send delegates to some free city—say,
Nice, and settle tne dispute by talking matters
over calmly and thoughtfully ? He hoped that
before very long the folly »nd wickedness of war
will be abolisned, only to be remembered by the
men of coming years as one of the horrors of a
bygone age.”


PEPPER AND SALT.
It would take a ’cute lawyer to get on
the blind aide of a Bombala (N.8.W.) jury. Lately
a man down there, who had long been afflicted
with disease of the heart, and was also subject to
fainting fits, fell off his horse and died without
any waste of time. The facts were duly sworn to,
and this was the verdict:—“ The said John Bul-
garies, on the 3rd day of January, 1886, being a
person subject to fits, was gently riding on a cer-
tain horse on a certain public road called the
Native Dog Hill road, in the county of Wellesley;
and being so riding as aforesaid, it so happened
that the said John Bulgaries was then suddenly
seized with a fit, and by reason of the violence
thereof the said John Bulgaries then fell from the
hack of the said horse to and against the ground
of the said public road, and then shortly died.
And so the jurors aforesaid do say that the said
John Bulgaries, by the violence of the fits afore-
said, and in the manner and means aforesaid, came
hy his death, and not otherwise.” It is not often
that a man earns the compliment of so elegant a
verdict as that. But we notice two or three slight
omissions. The verdict, for instance, omits to
state that the said John Bulgaries was sitting on
a certain saddle, and holding a certain bridle, and
that the said horse was of iron-grey in certain
colour, reared a certain poddy by John Smith and
out of a certain Zetland mare. Nor is it stated
whether the said J.B. was riding with his certain
face to the said certain horse’s tail; and the ver-
dict is dumb as to the cut and colour of the certain
pants worn by the said J,B. There is one other
omission which is especially noticeable, and that
is the omission of all common sense in the
framing of the verdict. From this circumstance,
and from the tautological redundancy of verbiage,
we certainly think that a certain Dan. O'Connor
must have sat on this very certain jury.
*
Four young men were brought up at a
Melbourne police court the other day on a charge
of using bad language. The arresting constable
deposed that, previous to using the language,
they bad been eating saveloys at a cart. As if
this was not sufficient excuse for any language.
We once—no more—when in Melbourne, ate a
saveloy from one of the carts, and it was as much
as our religious convictions and pious training
could do to keep us from committing a burglary
or killing someone on the way home. The crimes
we thought of I IJghl The very remembrance of
them makes us shudder. For that quarter of an
hour we were filled with the fancies of flends.
Take our word for it. There is more abandoned
wickedness in a saveloy than in au average gaol.

The workings of the bucolic mind are
strange and weird. An agricultural society called
” The Associated Australian Yeomanry ” was
founded in Victoria not long since. The President
is a parson, and, perhaps for that reason, one of
the conditions of membership in the original rules
was as follows:—“Any person of good moral
character being a hona fide cultivator or owner of
land, or having a direct interest in the ad-
vancement of the arts of cultivation, may be ad-
mitted to membership.” Fancy an advertisement
of the Society:—
GREA.T PLOUGHING MATCH,
at Grumbudgerle.
Prize: A Family Bible.
Only Pure-Minded Ploughmen admitted as
competitors.
| Intending competitors must bring with them
certificates of moral character from the Minister
of the Parish in which they reside. No sinners
need apply. Hallelujah 1
It would be full of gorgeous amusement—
wouldn’t it ? But the Family Bible would have to
be carted home again by the generous donor.
There would be no competitors. Probably it was
with a view to this possibility that the stipulation
about moral character was, at the wish of s
majority of the meeting, struck out of the rules,
But its excision nearly broke the heart of the
reverend President. Imagine him having to pre-
sent a prize so a man who never darkened the door
of a church or contributed a threepence to the
plate! m m m
With joy we welcome the advent of anew
hard. He has written a poem, specially for the
Melbourne Herald, all about a little boy and girl
Let us quote two of the opening verses:—
“She, too, was an orphan; they played in theii
childhood
Together, and roamed through the brake and the
Wildwood;
Like sister and brother, cleaved ever together
In sunshine, in fog, spring, or winter’s bleak
weather.
“ I’ve seen them when fast and thick fell the snow
flakes IpC;?
Look glad in their misery for each dWfr's sak«|
Pvo seen them laugh loud when the tempest
came near,
Each other's sad hearts ever striving to cheer.”
With a tew strokes of his facile pen the poet here
presents to us a touching picture of Infantine
virtue and devotion. In imagination we can see
the little friends cleaving together in the fog-
They are not a bit afraid. The boy is feeling his
way homo by the garden railings with one hand,
while the other paw is locked in that of his fair
companion. Then, again, we can behold them
dissembling their anguish when the snow is falling.
Instead of weeping bitterly, as most children
would do under such circumstances, this delect-
able couple are gathering handfuls of the frozen
vapour and hurling them at old women in well-
feigned glee. Bless their hearts I The poet must
excuse our inability to seethe loud laughter with
which they offered mutual consolation when the
weather broke up, but we can hear those merry
Biggies—aye, in our dreams. Would we had space
to reprint all this poem. It is long, however.
Suffice it to mention that the little girl tumbles in
fc he water and gets drowned, and the little boy h
only rescued from a similar fate by a “gallam
Newfoundland,’’ who biines hi u back to “sun
Lind.” The ingenuity disp ayed in fludirgasuh
ahe rhyme to No* foundlaud it wort hy of not m
fc>o la the courage of the poet in signing bis rmm
to his work, IDs rame is-but no matter. Tt
world will learn it soon enough. Let this ba ■■
oniy perpetrate one marc poem and ho will pru-
bably die famous. At any rate, he will die. The
Melbourne public will see to that.

There is trouble in the Chinese camp at
Ballarat. Two of the almond-eyed Celestials have
adopted Australian vices and taken to using ob-
scene language. Obscenity, in any shape or form i
is so out of place in a Chinese community that we
are not surprised to hear that a deputation waited
upon the Ballarat police authorities to ask for
summonses against the misguided twain. But
now comes the trouble. The swearing was done
in Chinese, and the sergeant told his pig-tailed
petitioners that he was afraid a prosecution
wouldn’t lie, as the magistrates could’nt under-
stand the naughty words when they heard them.
In vain the poor gentlemen tendered a literal
translation into English of the offensive expres-
sions. The sergeant pointed out that a Chinese
curse might be a British blessing for all the law
knew to the contrary. This is a sad state of affairs,
and one of the misfortunes to which a respectable
citizen is subject through understanding Chinese.
We have often suspected the gentleman who
supplies us with vegetables of addressing us in
other than the language of prayer, but, clothed in
ignorance, we have kept ourselves undefiled.
These Ballarat Chinamen, are deserving of our
sympathy. Bring the office tom-tom:—
Oh I pity those poor strangers
From a foreign Pagan land.
Thus exposed to social dangers
Which our law don’t understacd;
We hear their wail despairing,
And weep—but none the less
Ah Sin can keep on swearing,
While his friends have no redress.
Why shouldn’t a Celestial
(As moralist we speak),
Who uses language bestial
Be brought before the “ beak V ”
’Xis really past all bearing
That these yellow-cheeked Chinese
Like troopers can go swearing
And blaspheming when they please.
When we hear words improper—
A British “ dash ” or “ dim
We call the nearest “ copper,”
And make complaint to him;
But the Chinee, merely wearing
His usual placid smile,
Can calmly start a-swearing
In his Oriental style.
Oh I pity, then, these strangers
From far across the sea,
Bxposen to snares and dangers
That vex not you or me;
Let’s trust they are preparing
For that happy region blest,
Where the wicked cease from swearing
And a Chinaman can rest.
Upon the same subject an old comrade of Sir
Henniker’s when the noble knight was lighting
up the columns of the Evening News with his
glittering reports of “ gashly ” accidents in Eliza-
beth-street, and “fatel” collisions .in George-
street, gent’s us the following verses:—
“ Is this a dream ? a Joke ? a lie ?
Or can it be the shameful truth ‘I
I knew this Heaton in my youth.
A smooth-tongued fellow, sleek and sly,
With sallow skin and beady eye,
A creature that would crawl and creep,
An overgrown Uriaa Heop,
“ They never liked him, did the boys,
Though simply-born these honest lads,
They scouted all his scheming fads—
Yet shared with him their saveloys;
No d<5ubt this thought he now enjoys.
And though at him they’d jeer and laugh,
They’d till him up with shandy-gaif.
“ How many times—how many a night—
Have I corrected his weird spelling ?
Ah, well, It’s hardly worth the telling
How frequently I have put right
The grammar of that noble knight.
I wonder if the slipp’ry rogue
Would drink with me now—or Jim Hogue!”
There are two more verses, but they border too
early < n the ill-natured for us to print them.
We do no mi :d publishing anything in the shape
if a little harmless badinaaie about Uemiiker, but
1 ve will not have anything said about him that
would be likely to hurt his feelings. But could
any suca thing be said ?, We will not attempt it
anyhow. Tae writer had better tend the excised
verses to Prank Beonett
Poor Joe Thompson is to be commiserated
as the hero of the very lamest doggrel that ever
disfigured a sheet of paper. It appeared in the
excruciatingly funny columns of a little Mel-
bourne weekly, anent the robbery at the “ levia-
than’s ” house. Here it is :—
Rob Joe? Our Joe?
Not much, Itbiak— Boohmaking Joe ?
This with a wink— He's not so slow.
Not so. Oh, no I
No man lives, ho, ’ Rob Joe ? what ohaif I
Who could, you know, It makes us laugh,
Rob Joe ? Our Joe ?
But if the tale be true, at most
The robber was a ghost.
Great Scott I ’tis horrible. We cannot let this
culprit continue his career of crime unchecked.
A word with him:—
Write verse I Write verse
Good man alive, And give it, look
You ought to drive To Jane, the cook
A hearse; (She’ll curse);
No corpse inside But-take the hint—
Could, if he tried, Don’t ever print
Write worse. Your verse.
But if you will persist—Oh, well!
Send each subscriber round his shell.

Another witty, genial, warm-hearted,
thriftless man of letters has gone. He has gone
to the Melbourne gaol. We speak of Herbert
, one to whom — quoting his own
pathetic words—“ the cause of literature in Vic-
toria owes much.” Not having enjoyed Herbert’s
personal friendship, we are unable to say what his
exact line is. It's the cursed drink demon that is
at the bottom of all this suffering and disgrace,
dear fe-rends. Literary genius begins its career
by putting its face in a glass, and winds up by
hiding its head in a “jug.” A ballad—
Very distressing insinuations have been
made from time to time about the moral purity of
the Victorian Parliament. Even Cabinet Ministers
haye not escaped the breath of scandal. As Ions
es these hints and inusndoes emanated only from
the vulgar Radical herd (who never reverence the
most respectable of institutions) we said nothing.
But last week a Mr. King, speaking at the Wes-
leyafl Conference in Melbourno.’said that “ men
had held very high in Victoria whose
private morality would not bear looking into. The
Wesleyans, as a body, ought to vote against men
of such a class.” We cannot remain silent any
longer. When the Wesleyans commence to attack
anybody it is time for one of the minstrel boys to
sling his faithful harp behind him, and throw in
his lot with the opposite side. He has slung it in
front of him. and is now singing— .
A Northern (N.S.W.) P.M. is rather hard
of hearing. He never gets on to a speaker the
first time, and then, unless the man has a voice
like a fog-horn, he doesn’t grip the right end of
his theme. The old gentleman is very highly
respected by his brother magistrates, and aJP. is
always found willing to act “ears” for him.
During the hearing of a case ia which a selector
was charged with damaging a sheriff's officer who
had taken possession of the selection in his afcser ce,
the farmer applied for a postponement The
sheriff s solicitor objected, when the tufclr, big-
boned selector turned and promptly r^markid,
“If you don’t shut up, 1Mbit you under the
earl ’ The lawyer appealed for the protection of
the Court, and the senior matr'Strate, turning lo
his colleague, innocently asked, “ What docs he
Siy?” The J P. responded, “He applies for a
postponement for a week.’’ “Postponed for a
week,” said the P.M., as he turned over his sheet
and called “ Smith against Johnston.” The lawye
left the Court muttering remarks uncompliment-
ary to the Bench, and hid in a tank till the free-
selector had left the town.

At a recant fire brigade practice at Albury,
some peculiar tests were given of the power and
force of the water supply. The first stream was
thrown on the dial of the post-office clock, and
the figures wash! and off. It is just as reliable now
though as before the deluge. After performlrg
this feat satisfactorily, the fire-fighters took aim
at a girl, and shot her through the back fence of
the Globe Hotel. She immediately went into hys-
terics. After watching her for a fewiminutes, the
water wasters coiled up their hose and went home.
On the next occasion of a visit of the member for
the district the hose carriage will follow the
triumphal car and occasionally demonstrate its
ability to fight the fire-fiend by squirting water
over the various buildings in the town. The
member had better arrange to be toted round in a
tank.

It was in the good old days, at Eton, N.Q.,
when the Barrett’s twist used to Jurk in the bot-
tom of the rum cask, that a billiard-marker, who
had been partaking too freely of that, or another
potent decoction, was brought up before two
local Justices of the Peace. The unfortunate
marker, despite his remonstrances, was fined £l,
with the alternative of being locked up for 24
hours. The £1 was duly paid and deposited in the
pocket of the senior J P ,and the Beach adjourned
to the nearest hotel to have a drink. While in the
bar, they were joined by the quondam prisoner,
who said, “ You might as well shout for me too,
as it’s my £l.” ‘‘l’ll be hanged if I do,” said the
senior “Justice.” “Oh, well, give me back my
£l,” said the marker, “and I’ll take it out in
quod.”

Carlotta Patti has broken another leg.
During her career she has broken fourteen. Lon-

You have got a
Lot of legs—excuse us, limbs—
While they’re breaking
We are making
For you laudatory hymns;
And still thinking
(Ah! you’re winking—
Well, we won’t let up, indeed)
That you hear of
Legs your share of-

We commend following obituary verse
to the Nooze and ifiE. Both these popular jour-
nals have worn the old “Dearest Msry, how we
miss thee,” till the type in which it is set looks
heartily tired of being coffined in its dismal leads,
and aches for a chance to expand itself in a mur-
der, a suicide, or even a drunk case. There is a
contradiction, too, in the line, “ How we ‘miss’
thee.” They do Kot “ miss ” her at all, they speak
of her as plain “Mary,” from start to finish of
their funeral howl. Now, the new verse is every
way as suitable as the other, and has the advan-
tage of being adaptable to all classes of defuncts.
Here it is:—
“ ’Tls the wink of an eye, 'tis the draught of a
breath.
From the blossom of health to the paleness of
death;
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the
shroud.
Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud.”
With a few alterations this would do as well for a
tap-room row:
He winked at the barmaid, she heard his eye click,
And promptly she banged him with half of a
brick;
From the gilded saloon he was fired in the crowd.
Oh! why should the spirit of masher be proud ?
There, Aeered, no charge for the suggestion,
which we are sure if you adopt it will “ give plea-
sure to all.”

Thus “Yidooq’’ in the Goulburn Southern
Abgus:—“ The way in which the Sydney papers
with one or two exceptions, pander to any indivi-
dual who is the possessor of a title, would be
laughable were it not the cause of extreme dis-
gust to all whose ideas are not tainted with tho
wretched spirit of Jingoism which dwells within
the breasts of the metropolitan journalists. Lord
and Lady Carington, of course, come in for tho
lion’s share of slobber at the present time; and
his Excellency must have a peculiar opinion of
the characteristics of the Australian people if he
takes his text from the Sydney Press. Last week
Lady Carington visited the immigration depot, to
witness the hiring of immigrants, and whilst the
roll was being called, the name of a child who had
died on the voyage was accidentally mentioned,
whereat the mother burst into heartrending
lamentations at the thought of her dead offspring.
‘The woman was promptly removed by the
authorities, as it was not thought correct that
Lady Carington should he an eye-witness of such
a scene.’ Not one word of sympathy for the un-
fortunate woman—the bereaved mother. She
was of the plebeian order, and was unworthy of a
thought being cast upon her, whilst such an
opportunity as was afforded of bringing Lady
Carington’s name before an already disgusted
public could not bo lost sight of. This sort of
thing is becoming nauseous, and the man or boy
who would hit the gifted writer of the paragraph
referred to over the eye with a decayed egg would
convey to him, in an unmistakable manner, an
idea of the estimation in which he is held by hla
unfortunate readers.”
Vldocq, lad. thy hand. Thy intentions are good;
But an egg, howe er strong it be viewed as a food,
Asa missive is weak, in tluss pititui days
When the land has gone off on the Carington
craze.
When all a man needs, from his shirt to his beer,
Is named after this most unfortunate peer—
From the hat on his head to the pants on his legs,
Should the vengeance of Heaven be embodied in
eggs ?
Ah, no. To repress each sad lickspittle hack
Needs more than an egg’s odoriferous smack
Such foreheads as theirs are, O honest Vidocq.
Might emilo at the petritled egg of a roc.
“SIR HENNIKER.”
“The Daily Chboniclb states that Mr.
J. Henniker Heaton, M.P., a recent resident in
N.S.W., will be knighted for colonial services.”
Hoi watchman on Cape SchanckI
Hoi warder on South Head,
Blaze up your beacon-light
And let the news be spread—
The news of wild delight,
That Henniker’s a Knight-
Great gods I—a man of rank I
Telll Alfred Bennett, yelll
And loosen your cravat,
And laugh a fearsome laugh,
And dance upon your hat I
And give each of your staff
A sixpence for to quaff
The liquor that they choose
Their ancient mate unto—
The everlasting swell.
Sir Henniker, boys—booh 1
Sir Henniker—ho 1 ho I
This paralysing news
Will kill us yet, we know I
But, maybe it’s a hoax.
Bung on us simple folks,
Unused to such grim jokes I
Maybe he wrote—that subtle elf I—
The telegram himself I
But no—no such chance; by the Lord,
It is said somewhere that all men
Must eat in their lives so much dirt -
He’s eaten enough for ten:
It is right he should have his reward.
UNHAPPHY HERBERT.
There are others like you, Herbert,
Thus reduced to mournful wrecks
Through a weakness for the “ sherbert ”
(Or a liking for the sex).
Only look around you, sonny,
Arthe many, many such,
Who have not got any money,
Though their country owes ’em much.
You were probably a poet;
Bards are born to grief and care
(AM indeed we’ve cause to know it),
And their lot is hard to bear;
We could mention hundreds, Bertie
* (Here a tender chord we touch),
*Who are greasy, drunk, and dirty,
But their country owes ’em much.
A SOP FOR THOSE SENATORS.
Oh, no I we won’t believe it; bide the wicked
thought away,
No mortal shall persuade us to suspect an M.L. A.
Of the little fleshly failings to which other men
are prone—
Only listen to their speeches. O! how moral
Is their tone.
The measures they delight in must be passed in
Virtue’s cause,
And every blessed member wants to add his
special clause;
For a holy fear and trembling, lest mankind should
go astray,
Seems to mark the legislation of t ie modern
m.l.a.
Graham Berry, you remember, sought a certain
bill to pass,
Which had changed each blushing barmaid to a
Hallelujah lass;
If a lot of worthy members, in a manner meek
and mild,
Hadn’t said they’d found those barmaids to be
pure and undeflled.
Are these the sort of people to do any naughty
thing—
As giddy as was hinted at, the other day, by
King?
Don’t they carry out, in private, what they preach
in public life ?
Does any one among ’em have a secret from his
wife?
0,11 el we won't believe it; there’s no legislative
i gent
But is virtuous as Strephon, when he got in Par-
liament;
They may be (like that shepherd) Whig or Tory—
we don’t know;
But we’re positive their morals are as spotless as
the snow.

THE “HITCHCOCK” LAMP.
• •
The best In the world for
burning kerosene. No
chimney required, no
smoke, no odour, explosion
impossible.
This Lamp produces a
better light than gas. or
any other lamp in exist-
tence, it does not coat over
one farthing per hour, and
gives light equal to three
ordinary lamps.
This Lamp is now in all
countries throughout the
world, and thousands of
them are now in general
use in Australasia.
Testimonials are co v
in from all classes fro .. e
different colonies tes i’ v -
ing to the superiority i.£
this Lamp, a few of wtilch
are submitted to the
general public.
We defy the world to
produce an equal light at
the same expense as the
“Hitchcock” Lamp for
house use, balls, churches,
hotels, streets, steam boats,
, billiard tables, railway
I stations, cars, printing
offices, stores, mines, factories, or any other placaj
where light is required We caution the public'
against worthless imitations of this Lamp.

Gentlemen,— Having now useo, for some weeks,
one of your Hitchcock Patent Kerosene Lamps, I
unhesitatingly pronounce it to be the best light I
have ever seen for medical use. The steadiness,
brilliancy, and soft colour of the flame render it
invaluable when the opthalmoscope is in rcquisi-
tion.
I am, gentlemen,
Yours, very faithfully,
A. WILL AN JACKSON.
~ Cooma, June 6.
Dear Sir,—l have very much pleasure in certify-
ing to the durability and finish of the Hitchcock
Lamp of which you are agent. I have thoroughly
examined it, and must say without tusitstion it is
the best of the kind I have ever seen. I have fre-
quently had occasion to repair lamps of similar
make, and believe that the mechanism of the one
I am now writing far exceeds any of them—
stronger, and not nearly so complicated—ana I
might also mention that it is a mt st economical
light, one Lamp showing as much light as three
ordinary ones,
I am yours, Ac.,
C. HAIN, Watchmaker.
Cobar, Sept. 3, ’B5.
Dear Sir,—l beg to acknowledge receipt ot your
note making enquiries as to the Lamps purchased
some months ago, for our church at Cobar. It
gives me much pleasure to be able to inform you
.that the ‘f Hitchcock ” Lb mp is all th*t it is repre-
sented to be. 1 have seen nothing equal to your
Damp; itrisfnany decrees superior to tne ordinary
Kerosene lamp, and is admirably suited for church
use.
Most sincerely yours,
L. BELGBR.
Carisbrook State School,
7th July, 1885.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in certitymg
that I have been using one of Hitchcock’s Patent
Lamps for some time, and that it gives a very
brilliant shady light in a large room, and is a sav-
ing in kerosene and glasses; the flame is very like
a Jet of gas, and in every way the Lamp answers
all my expectations. I intend, if possible, in future,
to use no other.
Yours, faithfully,
HENRY BBILBY, Head Teacher.
Dunolly, Victoria, 7th July, 1885.
Sir,—lt affords me very much pleasure indeed
in bearing testimony to tne superior advantages or
the “ Hitchcock Patent Lamp ” over those in com-
mon use. The light given by this Lamp is bright,
clear, and steady—not, unlike a jet ot good ga»
light, but without its flickering. By means pi »
1 can see clearly to perform many little delicate
operations that I would not have attempted wim
the ordinary lamp light. When covered by tne
shade it throws down a soft clear light, not at an
injuiious to the eyes while reading I can conn-
dentlv recommend it as a study or consulting-
room Lamp to country practitioner like myselt, as
well as to the general public.

After all, it is to the Olympic before
“Carmen” is taken off (“L’Africaine’ is bmng
rfiheaned). you must go for real enjoyment. The
writer of “Carmen” is dead. He saw his work
produced in Paris, and vexation at the slip-slop
wav (there were only 500 people on the stage) it
WBB put on, killed him. Had he attended the
Olympic he’d be alive still. The actors would be
rtfiad And vet they wel*p good enotigh In tneir
wav. but the whole surroundings were provocative
mirth. To begin with, the stage of the Olympic
ias never meant for anything more than a c og
hornpipe, or, at mosq a magic Jantern representa-
tion of scenes In the Holy Land, got up by a
travelling missionary to Keep foundling-asylum
children irom scepticism. The result was that the
whole strength of the company couldn t appear
at once without spilling into the orchestra, and
causing the person who kept up a series ot isolated
grunts on the trombone to climb into the gallery,
ff he wanted to have his solo out. The effect of
the limited space was seen in various ways-
notably, in tne smugglers’ cave, in which one
talrlv-developed outlaw couldn’t lie down without
throwing out bales of cashmere silks and Persian
carpets to make room. Whe i the Toreador (Mr.
Gainer) appeared, his Splendid presence caused
fond applause. But it was instinctively felt that
Slaughtering bulls-unless they were tied-was
tffobably the last occupation he d adopt if left to
himself.
* * *
Raiaford was Zuniga, a Spanish captain.
There was about him an air of fierce determina-
tion, of cruel ruthiessness, which caused many in
the gallery to stop sucking oranges and attend to
what was going on. But he softened after a bit,
and at last became So mollified as to put his hand
to his mouth in the “ I-must-dissemble ” style and
take the pit into bis confidence. The Peninsular
uniforms require attention. In changing fire-
brigade helmets into military head gear it is not
wise to remove all the brass edging, as the rims
always appear limp and out of sorts afterwards.
Miss riherwin was Carmen. I3he dances, sings, and
plays the castanets. We like her singing best—her
dancing has a certain grace about it, but you re-
gret alter a while that she learnt it. She has a
aignitled way of pointing when she wants the
room or the caVe to hetself, but as nobody
appears to pay any attention to it, it becomes a
little titesottte. We think that when a person in
her position points to a window, a door, or a sky-
light, the soldiers or smugglers present should
tumble over each other in their desire to escape
by the orifice indicated. Messrs. Kelly and Clynton
were outlaws. You’d never think so but for the
murderous weapons worn in their girdles. When
Captain Rainford bit his Up in proud acorn at hav-
ing to submit to such “ trash,” we trembled for
bis life on seeing both scoundrels coldly aim at a
point some Inches above his head. Nor were our
■tears for the brave officer’s life allayed till the
conviction forced itself upon us that the stocks
and barrels of the firearms had long since parted
company,

Apropos of the performance, L'entr' Actc
says ‘‘it proved once again that the latent talent
we have in this fair land of Australia only requires
to be trained to rival the sunny climes of Italy.”
This has been our opinion all along -it’s training
that’s wanted. We knew a promising young tenor
in Ballarat who went la for a course. When he
started you couldn’t get a detached cottage under
20s a week. By the time he could sing the varia-
tions to “ Home, sweet home,” people used to
drive their cows into the street to graze. Allpress

that he keeps his hair short because his neck is
long. But surely there are other means of making
your neck look short if you want to. We knew a
man to borrow a butcher’s chopper and —[We

of a novel and effective pattern, and uniforms
which no foe could be found to face, don’t miss

Academy of Music, for so long the
rainstrelsy and mirth, is now devoted to
Tom- l® y and pathos. In presenting “ Uncle
s Cabin.” the management has evidently
e °®binaU° disp!ay tlie versatility ot the Federal
Urpit B u °t necessary to allude to the work
aurto ® e . nt ’ 0 UncU Tom fully accords with the
heir ® r ° 88 8 ideas Uncle Tom was an impossible
a sort of 13-carat Christian, from whom the
alloy had been removed, until he stood out In bold
relief a sample of the genuine article in standard
fineness, too soft to wear well, and too good to
get along any further than the cemetery,where he
is, after a lifetime of tribulation, eventually borne.
This is merely supposition, as the play does not
show that he was burled. He was duly killed,
though, by Legree, after which he helped to swell
the numbers of “ Nearer to Thee.” Bent deserves
mqfe than a passing line of commendation We
haVe always identified hint} with funny business,
and it is hard to dissociate llim from! the superla-
tively ridiculous, but in his representation pt Mrs.
Stowe’s creation, he develops histrionic ability of
a high order.

The Topsy of Miss Fanny Wiseman is the
Topsy she gave us years ago. She has not
fallen off; she has little room for improvement.
How sweetly familiar the old gags sound, “ Golly,
I’se so wicked,” and the alphabet in the auction-
room, “a-b, ab; i-b, ib; u-b-blowedl” Have we
heard her before? Aye, several years ago.
$ * *
Legree is represented by George Collier,
than whom no better nigger-driver is to hand. The
brutal slave-owner is fittingly represented, and
the frequent and fervent hisses of the audience
are his nightly tribute. In the scene when the
lock df Eva’s hdfr is discovered in Uncle Tom’s
possession and brought to Legree by one of his
creatures, the acting is rather heavy. A man
steeped to the eyebrows in Iniquity, and sunk to
the bed-rock of vileness, who can flog women and
kick men, is not likely to be excited to any great
extent by the sight of a tress of golden hair.
Legree was only fitted to be a slave-driver or a
N.S.W. Judge. He loves the lash—its whistle is
music to his ear, and his greatest joy is to chop
the frightened, terror-striken slaves at every
opportunity. We have a few Degrees here. Miss
Thayne is a child. She was “ Dear little Eva,” and
she climbs the golden stair. Miss Thayne’s mentor
has evidently forgotten to impress upon her
youthful mind the necessity of dying gradually.
Her voice is not that of a dying child, and she dies
like a chicken struck by a sparrowhawk, or a baby
goat introduced to a msh of lightning. Her de-
cease is too unpremeditated; little Eva died of
consumption, not heart disease. The Cdssy of
Miss St- Lawrence is enjoyable. She is so unlike
womankind. The spirit of forgiveness winch
a woman is credited with holding so largely has
not a quarter-acre allotment in her composition.
She was as bitter as an opened bottle of yester-
day’s colonial, and as goad a shot as Ike Austin.
Sha shoots at the man in the tiles, who engineers
the eurtain, and drops Legree as dead as a Hkkalp
leader on the stage. Miss Millie Collier’s Eliza won
her the sympathetic favours of the audience. Her
escape across the ice was a duet with the
mechanist, in which she played the leading part.
Aunt Opheda was represented by Miss Koehefort,
who made muoh of a part which, like sodawater
or death, has little attraction at tlje latter end.
Aunt ’Phely is only useful with Topsy, so tnepfirt
is a thankless one.

In spit© of the rapidly increasing mor-
tality in several of the suburbs, the management
continue “Cinderella” at the Sydney Theatre
Royal, and audiences, redolent of revenue to the
triumvirate, continue to assemble. Greville, the
beauteous Clorinda, introduces a lot of new busi-
ness, which we are quite willing to admit is better
than the stuff allotted him by the author; but lest
he should become inflated with pride on hearing
such an ample compliment, we hasten to sssure
him that we don’t see how it could possibly be
worse. Allround, the pant, is more permtaDd
witn originality than when first produced In
fact, it is whispered that one of the chorus girls
has something original in the way of—well, lower
limbs, you know,—it is alleged that there is no
sawdust in them. “ Cinderella” booms along until
the 13 bh last.
“Queen’s Evidence” is still much
en evidence at the Sydney Opera House, where
H. N. Douglas as Medland preaches from 8 till 10
every evening. "A 1 at Lloyd’s ” is in preparation.
Our one little prayer for the last month has been
lhat we may have something pleasant and nice to
say about that, for really we sometimes fear that
the smile which has awaited us lately at the Opera
House is not so full and enthusiastic as it usM to
be in days of yore, when we were able to write
cheerful little pars, about the performances at
that deleetable haven of sublunary rapture.

As a writer of comic songs, Mr. Lewis
Scott is not quite on a level with Gilbert, yet be
has achieved a success denied to the author of
“Pinafore.” At a musical matinee at the Gaiety
on Saturday the great Scott sang a comic song of
his own composition. It was a sort of autiphonlc
arrangement for a mother and her boy, ending
after each verse with the refrain, “ Not there, not
there, my child.” The first verse was as if a
barrel organ had gone on the spree before it began
to grind out “ Bold the Port ” and “ Nancy Lee,”
combined. The second verse was-considerably
worse, having a distinct resemblance to the noise
which mignt ne expected from a lunatic playing a
bag-pipe to three tom cats in a fowlhouae full of
Shanghai roosters. At the third verse all the kids
in the stalls and gallery began to howl, the theatre
resounded with fiery and fierce objurgations, such
as are flying around when two mobs of monkeys
are boxed by their drovers; and yet the singer
warbled on through another verse before he fled
from the stage. Percy, at the piano, admitted
afterwards that he never had passed so anxious a
five minutes, except on one previous occasion
when he refused a drink in a ’Frisco wnisky
saloon, and dodged six revolver bullets before the
firing ceased, and has ordered a suit of Kelly
armour in readiness for the next occasion when
Scott may require his services as accompanist.

The “Glass of Fashion ” was not a very
huge success at the Melbourne Bijou, ana
“ Betsy ” has displaced it. This is Betsy's second
appearance on Melbourne boards, Fred. Marshall
having Introduced her to notice at the Princess,
some four years ago. Mr. “Punch” Burnand,
when he adapted" Betsy” f'om the French, des-
cribed his work as a three act comedy. Many
people would describe it as a farce. No matter-
farce or comedy— ■’ Betsy ” is amusing, and, which
is even more important, strictly proper. In spite
of that suspicious French origin, we were not
calle t upon to blush once during the three acts.
How attentively we listened for a single sugges-
tive line, in order that we might take up our hat
and flee, none but omseives can guess. The strain
on our stage-ear was somuthing fearful.
ti *
It isn’t necessary to explain the plot of
“ Betsy,” and, if it were, we shouldn't be equal to
the task. The comedy suits the company, two or
three of whom have to say and do much about the
same things that they said and did in “Nita’s
First,” or “ The Magistrate.” Once again
we have Miss Watt Tanner as a iond
and fussy mamma, Mr. Boucicault, the younger,
as an irrepressible '■ boy,” and Miss Trevelyan as a
pretty auntie. A nice looking aunt is, next to a
volati'e young sister-in-law, Nature's choicest
gift to man. A fellow may weary of his wife, of
the above-mentioned female relations— never. But
we are wandering from the point. Mr. Bouci-
caulfa juvenile aspect and mercurial manners
adapt him for such characters as Dolly Birkett.
He played as though his heart was in the work.
The boyish abandon with which he perched him-
self upon his mother’s knee, was positively infec-
tious, that it was. We fancy that incident inspired
many young men in the house with an ambition
for the stage. Mr Titheradge bustled through
his old part of Captain M’Manus m artistic fashion.
The Captain, you may remember, is one of those
selfish wretches who deal geotly with their owm
little peccadilloes, but are as severely moral as a
Presbyterian parson where tbe “missus is con-
cerned The complications brought about by
these conflicting traits in the Captain s character
have a lot to do with the fun of the piece.
* * *
Messrs. Flemming ami Hans Phillips helped
to keep the ball rolling, and Mr. Brough fairly
“ knocked ’erii ” as Dawson, the hopeful Doliy 8
tutor. Fred. Marshall, we believe, was the original |
Dawson in Australia. A»' wcf didn’t see him we

But we’d like to swear. Then there si Detsy—we
are positively forgetting the heroine. Miss Bouci-
cault was Betsy, the serving maid who fraudu-
lently procures a written promise of marriage
from Master Dolly, and means to make him act
acc irding. It is Miss Boucicault’s good fortune
that she doesn’t look waspish enough for the par,'.
Such a pleasing person as this Betsy wouldn t need
to use artifice in procuring a promise from the
“Noting master.” He’d propose to her once a
week,* gnd if she preferred him to the baker s
man-why, she’d marry him and raise Cain in the
family circle- And, by the way, we thought
Dolly showed execrable ta te in throwing oyer
Betsy. However, c hacundson gout, as we used to

George Rignold had a very successful
wind-up at the Melbourne Opera House. Mi- 8
Kate Bishop made her re-appearance In the
Banks ” for the closing week, and the people re-
joiced thereat. Miss Bishop is as great a favourite
with Melbourne playgoers as is that other Bishop
(shortly going home to fill an important engage-
ment at Manchester) with churchgoers. A tablet
in memory of Milton suggests to us a rhyme:
Ty y o bishops have in Melbourne won all hearts;
Etch worked for pie&es, but in different parts ;
Tae man, as preacher, earned an honoured place,
Tne actress, too, instruction gave in grace.
Though one depart, we need not go astray—
The other still can teach us—at the Play.
Uncommonly neat. According to present ar-
rangements Miss Bishop will appear in Sydney in
“ Called Back.”

Mrs. Langtry proposes, according to latest
advices, to visit Australia in 1887. There is no pro-
viso this time:—
Dear Lillie, when will you come oveEthe ocean ?
Pair feminine masher of newspaper fame;
We doubt very much if you have any notion
Of coming out here on the same little game.
Pray, purest of Lilies, let up on that racket,
Don’t promise to come here in year eighty-seven,
For time is but fleeting-one never can back it—
By that time, fair Lit, we may all be in Heaven,
Or Hades, or gaol, or such situation
Where care curls our forehead aad wrinkles our
Come at once, while we hold on this' earth occupa-
tion;
Not ours is the future; we only own now.

Madison Morton, the octogenarian author
of “ Box and Cox,” wrote another farce last year,
which was played for tbe first time on the <fch

which bears the awkward title of “ Going It.”

Joe Emmet is repeating those acts of folly
which have ruined his reputation’in the colonies
as elsewhere. On the night of November 37 he
and several of his company appeared in Pennsyl-

promptly and energetically hissed by the audience.

An amusing incident (nervr expression,
this) occurred during the rendition (therefs ori-
ginality!) of a “Faust” extravaganza ifit Dublin
some years ago. During the piece a very stout
Mephistopheies had to “go home.” There had
apparently been no rehearsal of this performance,
for when he tried to sink to the abode of the
demons, it was found that the space was not com-
prehensive enough. The demons below tried to
pull him and the mortals above tried to shove him
down, but still he stuck until a deep voice from
the pit gleefully roared out: “ Well,boys, it s good
news, anyway—hell's full!” and then, accepting
the situation, the management rung down the
curtain and postponed the actor’s descent to Pur-
gatory to a more fitting time, or, perhaps, only to
a more “fitting ” trap.
It is when looking at the sites and the
sights secured by the Roman Catholics for their
cathedrals la Australian cities, notably Sydney
and Melbourne—that the full force of semper eadem
comes home to one. In Sydney, the other day. a
secularist lecturer flippantly remarked, by the
time St. Mary’s was finished, the followers of
Tom Paine would be in a position to take it oyer
and turn it Into a “ Hall of science.” This is a
pleasant prospect for those to look forward to
who, In order to raise the sacred edifice, alloyred
their daughters to wear tights and swing on
horizontal bars. At St, Patrick’s, in Melbourne,
one of the towers is to be called the GooTd
Tower,”in commemoration of the Archbishops
escape from Q'Farreil. Even had O’P. been a
better marksman, the tower would probably
obtain the same name in commemoration of the
Archbishop s martyrdom. Thus it will be seen
that when a name is decided upon it is a matter of
little moment whether a bullet finds its billet or
not. And now it la proposed to call one of the
protuberances of Melbourne new English cathe-
dral the ” Moorhouse ’’ tower. Is it visionary to
suppose that by the time our grand-children
meet to vote for a Federated Australian no-
nunion, a re christening will have been demanded,
when Goold ana Moorhouse will give place to
names of men truly great?
The Burke and Wills monument has at
last been removed from Its commanding site at
the eastern end of Collins-straet, Melbourne. A
gentleman wrote to the Argus, expressing the
modest hope that the names of the explorers will
be carved upon the monument before it is re-
erected in its new resting place. He stated that he
had amused himself by asking passers-by if they
knew the names of the figures, and not one In ten
could give him a satisfactory answer. We sin-
cerely trust that the suggestion of the Argus
c irrespondent will be adopted, and while they are
about it ’twould be well to specify which is which.
We ourselves have never known that tor certain.
Many times we may have blown a sigh for
“gallant Burke” at the unmoved effigy of the
self-sacrificing Wilis, and vice versa. The people
who can discriminate between tbe figures of the
illustrious twain become fewer every year, and it
nothing be done In this matter, Burke ana Wills
will get hopelessly mixed in the hereafter. This
must be attended to. Only the other day we heard
there was a movement afoot to erect a statue to
Dailey and Lord Cariogton. Suppose they were
carved in marble —his Lordship as he appeared
when addressing the wharf-laborers, and the divine
BUI clad in Soudan helmet and sword—without a
word of explanation on the base of the statue.
There mignt come a time (for the greatest men
are soon forgotten) when the figure of William
would be mistaken for that of His Excellency the
Governor, The thought Is very painful to us.

An exchange announces that a local cele-

The latest of London ‘ rages” has been
the petting of those queer Bohemians-the artists’
“models.” Since earliest days of artistic study
the best figures and faces have been wanted for
this work. Thereat “grand old man” is seen at
his grandest only in an artist’s studio, where he is
possibly earning better pay than he could in the
Helds or in his fisherman’s boat. The elegant
young lady model-pretty of face and voluptuous
of figure—is possibly unequal to reading and writ-
ing; she prefers sitting and standing about,
clothed in her complexion only, to bossing a sew-
ing-machine or serving as lady’s maid. It is
fashionable now to have one of these artists’
“ models ” for show at 5 o’clock teas Surrounded
by a bevy of inquisitive women of title, “ Her
draco” or "my lady” out of the model
all that she can be got to tell of “life in tne

trifle more so. A few days ago a kanaka was
treated to a month’s seclusion lor stealing a bottle
of gin, and now we learn that one “ Richard
Anning has been fined £lO at the Charters Towers
Police Court for abducting a gin. As Richard is a

One Stack was also fined £3 for aiding and abett-
ing the aforesaid Richard ” We therefore perceive
how much more valuable gin in a square bottle is
than gin in a ’possum skin or blanket.
By exhibiting their skill in producing
sudden stoppages, some of the -Sydney motor
drivers enjoy a small modicum of fun at the ex-
pense of timid passengers in the hindcars of trams
preceding the jokers. The fun consists in coming
up behind a stationary tram, shutting off steam,
and applying the brake within a foot or two of a
oar full of passengers, and bringing the motor to a
full stop about an inch from the buffers in front.
On Friday the j oke was considerably enhanced by
a driver slightly overshooting the mark, and
crashing through the staircase and platform of the
tram in front of him.
Numbers of bares have made their appear-
ance around Waratah, and “it is hoped that
sportsmen will refrain from shooting until ample
time has been afforded for breeding,” says the
Newcastle Herald of 20th January. Well, the
Pastures and Snook Protection Board, Sydney, are
only offering 3s. 6d. each for hares’ scalps. But it
would probably give 3s. for the scalp-lock of the
noxious animal who wrote the original of the
quotation as above. Wait “till ampD time has
been afforded for breeding ”? Ample time to be-
come a clipper-rigged, copper-bottomed Al
nuisance is what the apology for a newspaper
scribe meant.
Here’s a hint for our next Soudan war:
“ The Royal Theatre at Belgrade, in Servia. has
been closed in consequence of most of its com-
pany being called away to the war. The intendant
of the theatre has been appointed manager of the
fever hospital, and tbe stage manager was killed
in the battle of Slivnitza.” We could spare Alli-
son; Rignold would be the very man to head a
storming party “ once more into the breech, dear
friends,” only the Arabs wear no breecnes. The
only drawback is that if our next sanguinary war
resembles our last, no one would be killed,
although there might be some mortality from
stomach-ache. Better reserve our heroej for em-
ployment in our own intestine disorders.
“The bride walked on the arm of her
father.” That’s an item from a country paper,
which gives a description of a fashionaole wed-
ding, and the performance took place in a church.
Now, if it had been in a circus there would have
been nothing extraordinary about the business,
but it seems that sensation scenes are at last re-

How would a trapeze performance, by the parson
in full canonicals, fit in as a commencement for
the sermon, or a Sheffield Handicap for the Sunday
school boys held in the ehurenyard after the first
lesson, answer ? We don’t make any charge for
these suggestions, but it is a certainty that there
would be not even standing room in the church
where they were adopted.
The strike mania is extending in a par-
ticularly healthy direction. The incumbent of a
Bt. Kiida (Melb.) church sought to dock his choir
of some of Its privileges The reverend gentle-
man, in short, ot-j eted to an increase of “ inflec-
tions ” in a certain portion of the service. He
delioitelv hinted that some of these inflections
were inflictions The mortified choir retorted
that if they couldn’t “inlh-ct ” as seemed to them
besn they’d “ strike.” Awml to relate, they did
“strike.” But ’tis not the disaffection of the
choir that we are exuding over. Not at all. Toe
thought occurs to us that possibly the parson will
“ strike ” the next time a rumpus occurs. These
dbgenslons in the Church must be encouraged.
When saints fall out, sinners get—left alone.
The divine right of undertakers to charge
whatever they choose for our little wooden
ulsters nnl “ trimmings” is sternly upheld by the
Melbourne Age Speaking of that thrilling
tragedy at Coburg, where a poor little girl was
lacrlftced at the altar of hysterical virtue, the
Age man censures Mr. Hampton, sen., for “ trying
to be it down tne undertaker’s charge for the
funeral in the room where his dead child was
Ding.” This is rough on Mr. H. The reporter
should have found fault with the Coburg Kirby
ior sticking on the exa. in the presence of the
corpse. The most practical way of paying respect
to toe dead Is to ask a modest figure for tne privi-
lege of inrying ’em. We shrewdly suspect,
though, that the Age man has a relative in tte
trade.
Evidently the cheap drinks movement
Initiated by sundry pub leans at Rockhampton
does not find favour witn toeir brethren farther
south if the following par. from a J unee paper is
correct:—“The answer of our publlcaos to the
threat to boycott them if they do not concede
fourpenny drinks to the ‘l-cos,’ i.i ‘No sur-
render.” Their customers seem determined to
take the most sorsible course, for: “It is
rumoured that those woo took partin the recent
‘fourpenny drink meeting’ contemplate starting
a club, wherein drinks will bo supplied to the
members at a slight advance (sufficient only to
defray expenses) on the original cost.” That club
will likely have a large membership, and the ob-
stinate honifaces of Junee will find out that the
value of a thing is just what it will fetch, and no
more.
Povyeirs an eccentric Englishman atten-
ded Wombwell’s menagerie round the world—never
missed a niaht in witnessing the tamer go into the
lions’den to put the animals through their per-
formance. His pertinacity was at last rewarded.
He was present when the head lion, in a fit of
jocularity, bit off the keeper's head. Similarly, a
Victorian rustic, with sceptical leanings, has
attended every lecture and sermon given by
Bishop Moorhouse. But this is what is wrung

There was a meeting convened by the
Mayor of Waverly last week to discuss drainage.
The meeting did not come off, but sometoing else
did. Two “fathers of families,” who hstd been
having the drainage first and tbe discussion after-
wards, md outside the place of meeting and edi-
fied a rapidly-increasing crowd with an exhibition
of mutual vilification of a highly entertaining
character. What time ihe choir practising at a
neighbouring conv< ntiole were so sadly disturbed
by the wordy warfare without that they hurriedly
completed the lit le hymn on wnich they were
engaged, aud streamed out of church to take a
passive part in the bloodless battle on the street.—

The Tam worth Observer says“ ‘ A
would-be poet’ writes: Believing that I possess a
faculty for rhyming, I am ambitious to become a
poet. As I have heard a great deal about the
poetic license, I am anxious to know whether or
not it is necessary for me to take out one of these
licenses, and, if it is, whore shall I apply for one ?”
Nothing easier, young man, than to be a “poet,”
and you don’t want any license. Just skim over
a few of Swinburne’s, Tennyson's, Longfellow s,
and Whittier’s effusions, aud study the obituary
“ potry ” of the h ooze Then sit down and hash

of a snake story in our columns this season. A
Northern doctor whilst travelling through the
bush surprised and killed (as he thought) a black
snake, and carried it home in his coat pocket
Daring his first leisure moments the doctor roiled
his Brize up very neatly, tied a label round its
neck with a scientific name as long as the tail of a
kite scratched thereon, and then placed the reptile
in a bottle of brandy and corked it up. The grog
seems to have revived the “ varmint,” for during
the night he drank up the greater part, pushed
the cork out of the bottle, and wriggled out into
the yard, wbere he was found the next morning
dancing madly round, spitting, hissing, and snap-
ping in all directions, apparently at an invisible
attacking army of parti coloured members of his
own species. Pity Eve didn't treat the original
snake to a toothful out of Adam’s private demi-
john before he had time to canvass for the apple
contract.
Justice’s justice is often remarkable for
its originality. What Sir James Martin, or Mr.
Justice Murray would gravely deliberate over for
days, and finally commit to a higher or fuller
Court, would be settled out of hand by any one of
the lately-appointed J sP. At a Northern
(N.S.W.) township recently a drover was charged
before two of the tangle-bearded tousle-headed
Salons who keep court up that way, with leaving
his camp-fire burning, to the danger of the pro-
perty of Her;Majesty’s lieges thereabout residing. |
The drover called his cook as a witness to prove
that the latter had caused the fire. The Comt de-
livered judgment this way:—“Well, Mr. Drover,
you’re dismissed; but (to the cook) you're fined a
quid.” The cook, let it be remembered, was not
charged, but that little omission made no difference
to those bucolic Daniels. They had come there to
fine somebody, and by the ghost of Thamls, they
weren t going home without doing it. These be
thy judges, O Stuart!
Tbe Postmaster - General has received
several schemes ana devices for the extermination
of rats in the General Post-office. A proposal
from Inspector deymour that he should pro
nounce the rats unfit for human consumption and
order them to oe destroyed, has been approved of
as far as it goes; an ingenious conception emanat-
ing from the fertile brain of a junior operator for
tha Introduction of wires into the rat-holes, and
the consequent destruction of the Incursive
rodents by electricity, has bsen rejected, on the
ground that tbe corpses of the slain could not be
removed; and a proposal to poison the rats by in-
jecting water from tne drinking fountains at Hyde
Park has been declined for the sime reason. The
only plan likely to be carried into practical opera-
tion is the proposal that the P.M G. himself should
visit the basements of his office, and deliver a
series of after-dinner speeches, which, it 13 con-
sidered, will have suoh a demoralising effect upon
the obnoxious intruders as to cause their imme-
diate stampede from the Post-office.
The writer of “ A Short Stay,” in the Mel-
bourne Age, complaining of extortion and inci-
vility in Tasmania, has received a “ slating ” from
an insurance agent, who refutes his aspersions as
groundless and spiteful. Many visitors assume an
air of superiority, and maki a point of depreciat-
ing everything Tasmanian, from “ victuals and
drink ” to local beauties—but a Victorian once met
his match in the late John Webb, of Webb’s Hotel.
This man grumbled systematically at everything;
“ Call these cherries, we have currants larger In
Victoria! Our grapes are twice the size of your
plumsi” One night, on retiring he obsarvod
something moving in his bed; investigation proved
it to bo a large live crayfish, which ne attempted
to remove. As a spring trap is mild compared
with a crayfish grip, his pious exclamations soon
brought the landlord to the room. Tne lodger
angrily demanded; “What do you call this?”
“That,” said Webb, “is a Tasmanian bed-bug,
have you anything of the kind larger in Vic-
toria ? ”
There are some people who like to look
fashionable even when dead. You remember
those lines of Pope’s:—
“ ‘ Odious in linen! ’Twould a saint provoke,’
Were tae last words that poor Marcissa spoke.
* No. let a charming chintz and Brussels lace
Wrap my cold limbs, and shade my lifeless face;
One not, sure, be ugly when one’s dead,
Aud, Betty, give this cheek a little red.”
We are reminded of these lines by reading of a
man who was lound dead in the Melbourne Trea-
sury Gardens, the other day, with an eye-glas s in his
pocket! It is said he died of starvation Y°t he
stuck to his eye-glass to the last. But he couldn’t
stare Death out of countenance, poor devil.
A correspondent, writing to the Melbourne
Age. asks why “an Australian Church of happy
promise and imposing presence and dimension ” is
not formed? We can tell him. Because the
people of Australia are quite satisfied with the
number of Churches they have already. Every
sect known to the English-sneaking races—except
a lew started in the Unit d States which began
with a programme of conquering the world one
day and were heard of no more the next—is repre-
sented out here, and has its priests, and parsons,
and pastors, and nanjandrums of all kinds, sup-
ported at the expense of the public. We want no
more skv-pilots. If what we have are not suffi-
cient to show us the way to Heaven we will have
to find a way ourselves. The priests of the future
—we speak not presumptuously nor without re-
flection—will be Editors, and the Pulpit of the
Future the Press.
Just at u time when Australian wool-
growers ace discussing the necessity of opaning up
fresh markets for their produce, it is amusing to
find this par. in the London Referee: "The
great wool-brokers are bewailing the state of
trade, and Amnc-sl difficulties in this branch of
commerce are imminent. I’he great drought in
Australia, and the heavy mortality of sheep are
the causes of the crisis. In this trade at present
there is a perfect Illustration of the proverb
Much cry and little wool.” In our ignorance we
had imagined that the trouble was the other way
round, and that limited demand was responsible
for low prices ruling in the London wool-market.
But very likely toe par. was only concocted for
the purpose of working in that little joke. Let us
get in our little joke It s a conundrum. Why
does a broker invariably do well in a bad season ?
Because he's sure to “get his wool off.” Bee ?
We believe in Australia—in its present
and in its future. We think that when many of
those around us to-day are tuning their harps and
hanging on siml-tones before the “Throne,” this
great Southern land will be the home of millions
of freemen. But it is when reading such stuff as
the following, from a Sydney journal, that our
bick arches, and we feel dangerous:—“ The enor-
mous realised wealth, the pro 'igal profusion of
precious metals, the extensive fields of coal iron,
copper, and tin ore are things to be grateful for,
&c„ &c.” Hard labour is said to be a thing which
every one admires, but which everybody is
desirous to depute to somebody else. So with
mining. Every N S.W. colonist boasts of the
“ prodigal profusion of precious metals,” but if
you apply to one of them for help in opening up
a promising quartz reef, or developing a stiver
lode, the invariable answ&r Is—“ As the th ng is so
rich, don't you think you’d better stick to it your-
self ? I’ve sworn <tf mining.” Within a few
hours of Sydney are ‘ or apects ” whicn, if fou id
in r,ne neighbourhood of Ba larat, Sandhurst,
or Btawcll, would be floated into compan ea i a
day. It is this complacent babble ab ut the pro-
fusion of minerals, without the least desire to give
a helping band In proving or disproving tbeir
existence that makes us bark. The prodigal pro-
fusion of “promoters” with rich specimens in
their pockets, and yarns just as rich in their
mouths, likewise encourages us to yelp.
The N.S.W. Premier’s Speech.
(BY THE BULLETIN PARLIAMENTARY POER)
At nearly five on Wednesday week th e Speaker
took the chair.
And round him all the statesmen proud 1 of our fair
land were there;
Gray Mudgee, o’er whose hoary head I i&s past a
storm of years,
And Burns, the Upper Hunter man, w'bo knows
not kine from steers;
Young Spring, o’er whose ambitious he; id no win-
ter's storm shall pass,
And Heydon, who was sent there froi n the sun-
dried plains of Yass;
And corn-cob Garrard, who was sent by Balmain as
“ for Works,”
Glanced proudly round, as if to say, “J’m he who
never shirks;”
And next the Hastings-Manning man —he J. H.
Young is bight—
Sat Grenfell’s chosen, Vaughn, to swell the voices
of the knight.
These, then, are they who’ll rule our land for
lengthy term or brief,
And follow to the bitter end the vet’ran Knight of
Beef.
But are these all ? Sweet people, no; throughout
this rhyme must run
One name, inscribed on leaf of gold— our Dan., the
only one;
’Tis he, the jaynial D. O’C. (Sir D. may he soon he,
Or e’en, by way of change, he might be then ;Sir

To him with eye of steel-blue-grey we look, t) iat

ingtree.” . . _
Stern glanced he round the crowded House, and
gazed upon his chief.
As who should say, “Dread not your foes, oh
ancient Knight of Boef,
For by the dust of ancient Greece and Tippe: :ary’s
sod,
I’ll fight and die beneath your flag, or biust—so
help me—Moses.” , ~ .
Then clasping with his dexter hand his Hun alayan
brow,
He kissed the Book and took the oath—h® us Post-
master now. „
Behind him came the “ following ”—the Mir ilsterial
tail;
They took the oaths and signed the rolls. Did any
of them quail ? , .
Not much; they're used to taking oakhs, that
mumble- jumole bunch;
And as for robs-great snakes, just view them at|a

Some trifling business being done. Sir John rose
up and said;
“At present, legislative gents, of this crowd I’m

a wink;
A most expressive lowering of the eyelid he

Tom Garrett once I thought would join, but he,

CORRESPONDENCE
L CorrctpondenU who awe neither name nor nom-tfe-
vhwme cannot expect to have their com-
munieationc noticed. 1
“W.G.J,” (Clifton): A striking yarn, but too
tropical —“ M.” (Yass): Will possibly work it up.
“ Sarah P.”; The main question is, “ Are you a
person ? ” If you are, the director of the Domain
can fire you out if you orate “not wisely but too
well.” “J.M.”: Who on earth are you? To
carry out half your threats you would need to be
a combination of steam-hammer, torpedo, Dan„
0 Connor, and Ncsey Bob “Lorando Jones”:
You say that the Parramatta police are more
generous than those of Sydney because they let
Sarah Parker preach. That’s all rot. Send Sarah
along here, and you will find there’s not a peeler
in Sydney who will dare to touch her. Armed with
a cotton umbrella and her native eloquence, we
would back her against a whole squad of “traps”...
Liberal”: You are wrong in your estimate of
the two senators. Sir George Grey, of New Zea-
land, is as much above the Hon. Graham Berry, of
Victoria, as Heaven is above earth. Sir George
has always been a good, thorough-going, consis-
tent Radical; Bsrry has posed as a Radical, but
was always ready to go whichever way the wind
blew—“ S.N.”: Can’t make out what on earth
you are driving at. Can you call and explain ?.
“ T.W.”: The only original Yiddlshire. By the
only original imbecile, we presu-ne “Maud
S. : Sorry that cur estimate is once more
below yours —“Science”; Some irremediable
faults of construction prevent our acceptance.
“ Toady ” (Toowoomba, Q.): There is much reason
as well as originality in your letter. Have posted
you our leader of June 38, ’Bl, which will, we
think, give you the exact information required
“Constant Reader” (Silverton): Glad of letter,
which will be of use.... “Oyster Johnnie”: After-
much consideration, declined. Teat address will
always be sufficient “A Working Man”;
Thanks. Always welcome. There is no ’orty
pride about ua, although when a man once sent us
a case of whisky we immediately returned it.
Fact “Chas. Emile”: Don’t play poker any*
more if it prompts you to write such poetry
Wrote it on the spur of the moment ? Not a bit,*
you wrote it on 16shandies ...“T. J. Denny” (Mel-
bourne): Will touch up and publish “M. G.”
tßundella): You have got hold of one solid truth,
anyhow—that the noblest loyalty is that which re-
gards the welfare of the whole nation. The word
loyalty is now generally understood to mean only
loyalty to a sovereign. This is wrong; a man can-
not be loyal to his queen if he is disloyal to the
majority of his fellow-subjects “Mtranger”:
Will keep it—out...." Baarski n Sorry that we
cannot accept. Very tew persons have seen the

cation would explain the result "D, H.”( Cler-

dress ? “ W.H.8.”: Tnanks; much obliged..
“ Murrumbidgee ” (Wagga): Should be glad if
you could send us address of the secretary of the
local committee interested in tne adjustment of

you are often taken that way. We use one of

all of taem. A proof of this is that they appeared
in The BuloETin about two years ago. You
should out your original matter from Older files.
We might possibly forget then. Better still, don’t
trouble to cut them at all. We have a file handy.

rest?” We can’t tell, but it may soothe you to
know that your screed finds rest—in the basket ..
“J. O. Byng”: There was a glow and a sparkle
about your poem, It borrowed this from the gas-
jet. You use beautiful paper; it burns very
readily, and leaves a white ash....* 1 Oyster John-
nie”: Wilt look through it for next week....
“Hsatoniana”: Will probably print.


It is singular how blind people are to their
own interests, by selling imitations of the genuine
Wolfe's Schnapps.
It is said that some people have no con-
science. It must be true, or Wolfe's Schnapps
would not be pirated as it is.
A correspondent writes:— “Your amusing

ran in one of Daffr-r’s calves for veal. Duff came
along iust as they were going to shoot. With the

quently gave the O’Sbake crowd in charge for

other, the property of Fake Duffer, to wit, one
calf.’ So ran the indictment. Now, the magistrate,
who knew the parties, resolved to prove the case
or disprove It in one act. His gigantic brain (he
dad a brain, though only a J.P.) evolved a scheme.
He ordered a muster of O’Shake’s run, and re-
quire that the cattle should be placed in the police
paddock. His Idea was to have the prisoners
brought, before him and compelled to pick from

oc as web to remark that they had arranged a
muster prior to that made by the magistrate's
maer, and the result of that muster was * tailed ’
Tw dbbsiderable distance by their own people.
O Shakes and Duffers grew more intimate
after this little turn up, and rapidly acquired
collossal fortunes. It would not surprise me to
hear of their Henniker Heatonising the old coun-
try at an early da’e.”
There has been a great controversy going
on in the Melbourne Argus lately concerning
Original Sin. A few feeble persons wrote against
this genial doctrine, and suggested the possibility
that the Almighty Creator might be ton good to
send people into tne world steeped in iniquity and
then damn them for all eternity because they did
not turn out saints. Immediate y a score of tru-
culent pens were dipped in gall and stabbed those
unfortunate persons wherever there wes a whole
soot left in their moral anatomy. “ What,” said
the score of pens, ‘ no original sin—no hell-no
Devil? Blasonemy unutterable 1” Then the de-
fenders of the Faith went on to show that they
I knew what was about when He created the
human race—they knew He had no intention of
letting more than a few samples of it enter into
glory. It is needless to hint that each man of them
considered himself a predestined sample. There is
not a doubt in our minds about one thing, and that
is that the great majority of mankind are still
Devil Worshippers. Gall the Power they worship
by whatsoever name they please it is still the
Power of Evil. Most of them would not care a
rush about entering Heaven if it were not exclu-
sive. and would look upon the Almighty as of
very little account if He did not distribute damna-
tion with a libera) hand. One of the most violently
amusing contributors to the controversy is a cer-
tain Mr. D. M Berry, who says defiantly in his last
etter:—“ If anyone wants me to surrender the
Book of Genesis, let Mm come and take it,” There
is a rumour among the ungodly that this gentle-
nan keeps that venerable work in a burglar-proof
safe and hires two men and a bulldog to watch it
night and day. It is a pity. We shouli like to
have been able to read it. We have heard t
abounds m humour:—
The ship Afghan brought to Melbourne a
cargo of Chinamen the other day. It was dis-
covered that the majority of them were travelling
on transferred naturalisation papers. In addition
to this, a charge was brought against the captain
for bringing 63 more of them than is allowed
under the Ad For each of these he ran a risk of
being fined £IOO-£5300 in all-not counting other
expenses which fall upon the victim of law. It
never struck us before that any Chinaman under
the rank of a manladu of three button* could be
worth £IOO In any connection The curious part
of the affair was, that some of the Chinese, who
were 10 years of age, tried to pass themselves off
as young fellows of 11. and some of 17 years of
sge reversed the process. It is probable they
would have been successful—for few Europeans
can arrive at the true age of a Clilooman until he
pasies his fourth decade—had there not been a
Chinese interpreter on board. They couldn’t fool
him, whatever they might do with the played-out
Caucasian. Talking of this, reminds us of the
saying of De Quincey that he could never look
into the face of a young Chinese without a feel-
ing of awe—the burden of countless ages looked
out of his solemn slanting eyes There is nothing
—we speak from our own exper etce now-so
bard to stare at as the eyes of a Chinse baby. You
begin by feeling a kind of pity tor the little yel-
low mite of an inferior race, and you gaze at him
with a superior semi-amused expression. But by
degrees you begin to see that his thoughts are not
witb you. You begin to feel with a creeping sen-
sation that he is looking back acroFs the dim ages
to a time before the first stono of the Pyramids
was laid before N'ah built his ark—perhapi
before the Aryan Adam rose up majestic out
of the red earth and commenced pruning
apple trees and maslng love to Lileth. An or-
dinary European ha >y is h-ird enough lo st*re at
in his moments of meditation, but be is vs a wax
figure tn the Sphinx compared with a Cathaian
child. We have got a little out of our track, hut
wa are fond of rambling along in a leisurely way.
We may sry, In conclusion, that the captajn of
the Afghan was lined only £IOO instead of £5300 —
the penalty for one being considered sufficient
under the circumstances. We should have ima-
gined the proper way of doing would have been
to fine each of these 63 Chinamen the £lO poll tax
tor having entered tne cohny without proper
papers, and then compelled t e company that
brought them to take them back again. We were
cut out for legislators, but the cold world has gone
on ignoring the fact so far.

We notice, Mr. Berry,

This case of exact regard to the proprieties
of the eight-hour movement is worthy of more
than a passing notice. A carpenter was employed
driving a screw in a Government office door on
Friday last, when the witching hour of knock-off
time arrived, and Instantly packing up his traps,
he cleared, leaving the screw barely fastened in
the wood. That night the door fell aown, raising
a lump as big as a flrebell on the head of a passing
clerk, and smashing 30s. wortn of property. The
only parallel we know to this is that of the con-
scientious carter, who, being e? gaged to deliver
300 bricks at a c rt in building, drove up with his
load, and bad Just succeeded in delivering ten
bricks wnen the welcome six o clock tocsin
sounded Being fully alive to the fact that time
and. tide wait >01 no men—except, perhaps ft very
rich man—he deliberately drove home with the
remaining 190 bricks, remarking, Mth a firmness
that did him honour, that a sofiety’s rules were
nothing unless properly carried out, and he’d go
where the voice of •• dooty ” called him. Such
men as these are a credit to their sex, and we can *

CHILDREN'S COLUMN
The editor writeth
Please, Mr. Artist, use your ablest skill,
And start the maids who write this page to fill;
Last week the hoys unfurled their tongues and
wrote,

Au air of short-frocks, bread and jam, and dolls,
This week shall hover o’er Our Children’s Cols,
So, Mr. Artist, please you power diplay,
And limn for ua a little girl to-day.”
The Artist draweth his idea of a girl, and placed
It at the top of a column.
Then the editor apostrophiseth the girls as per
foregoing sample;—
“ Come hither, dear Jemima Jane, and Rose, and
Emma, too—
Lay down the sticky bread-and-jam, and write
us billets-doux.
Give us your chat on politics, ’tis certain to be
wise,
And tell us of the cumuli which decorate the

‘ Give it a breeze,’ tell us about your sweethearts
and your frocks—
Your cats and dogs, and stockings, too, with
pink or scarlet clocks.
Lay back your ears and grit your teeth that all
the world may know
That you can write with any kids the Jernil
crowd can show.”
The little girls thereupon gird up their stockings
and forward two lorries loaded with letters and
sketches, from which we select a few. The first is
the work of a very young but abnormally en-

girl, and just 17 years old. At Christmas, my
sweetheart and I came to Sydney to enjoy our-
selves. We went twice to church on Christmas
Day, and afterwards spent a short time in the
cemetery reading the inscriptions on the tomb-
stones. They are very nice, and I enjoyed myself
very much. Johnny and I have never been in
town before. Please, Sir, can you tell me what is
the matter with all the Sydney young ladies. They
are so strangely shaped. Johnny says the top hal
of them is like a sugar-loaf turned upside down
and the bottom half like a kangaroo with a pack-
saddle on. Some of them have very pretty faces,
but I noticed on the boat that the red of their
cheeks ran down with the perspiration, and they
grew very tallow-candle coloured before we got
to Chowder, Dear Sir, what is an improver, and
what do you mean by sawdust limbs ? I think the
Sydney young men are very rude. I was passing
the post-office on Anniversary Day, and you
know how wet it was; well, some young men
called out * She’s got ’em on.’ I couldn’t help it

latest racket ? Blessed if I ain't been bundled out

says he’ll get me a cot this week, but I am not to
be cot with that kind of chaff. There’s going to
be a funeral leave our place next Wednesday at
3pm The new kid will occupy a prominent posi-
tion in the procession—he will be in the front oar.
I’ve readied up a pea-shooter and I’m going to
shoot sago at his face; when I get a chance at him
I’ll volley him. You know, when his face gets
marked with the sago they’ll think it’s measles and
send for the doctor. That’ll settle him. I know a
doctor nearly put me away when I was young.
You’ll come to the funeral, won’t you? I say,
don’t forget to write a leading article showing the
injustices a young lady has to labour under when
there is an addition to the family and the ingrati-
tude of parents. Why, the fun I’ve given my
folks this two years—when I think of it and their
ingratitude. Oh I Can I write a verse or two-
blank verse this week :
What is ingratitude ?
’Tis the serpent’s tooth,
Th’ envenomed fang
Which strikes the treacherous blow;
The murderer is kind.
The robber virtuous,
The hen-roost thiof is good
Compared with him of former gifts unmindful.
Shall I, too, suffer
In mine early day
The look askance,
The harsh ‘ Shut up I’ the slipper ?
Not me, you bet.
I’ll reinstate myself,
And shortly put away that other nipper.

There is mourning among Victorian mem-
hqrs of the Australian colony in London. The
Victorian Government is about to levyanincome-
tax on absentees. The income-tax will be levied
nn whatever portions ot their money are remitted
?o them irom the colonies. This information
pleases us better than rum-and-milk.
At the Federal Council Assembly in
Hobart on the 26th instant, on the motion of the
Won Graham Berry, a telegram was ordered to be
sent to Her Majesty the Queen, expressing the
lovalty of the Council to her throne and person.
After this, if Berry isn’t duobed Sir Graham when
he goes home soon as Agent-General for Victoria,
it’s a caution. What else has this moribund politi-
cian been aiming for since he deserted the Radical
party? # , „
John E. Williams, a labor-candidate for
Hampstead at the late English elections, writes to
the papers about the expenses ot the ceremony.
He says I know not to this hour from whence
the money came, and. as a Revolutionist, I care
not ” There is a hatful of significance, or none at
all in the word “Revolutionist” in the above
connection. Anyway, some of our labour-candi-
dates in N.S.W. would be glad it they could look
back on the “ expenses” with as gay a heart as
Mr. Williams.
He had heard that the office of assistant
Postmaster was vacant. Speeding at once to an
influential Sydney man about town, he asked tor
a letter to the jayniai one, in which his suitability
for the situation was to be fully set forth and tue
granting of the office made a personal favour to
the reoommender. The letter was at once written
and handed to the applicant, with this remark:
“Now, if you want that billet you take that letter
round at once, for, by thunder! as soon as they ye
done speaking that Ministry’ll be out. Vox
populi.
The Scottish Highlander, the organ of
the Crofters, urges the Crofter representatives, of
whom there no w about half-a-dozen, to take a leaf
from Parnell’s book, form themseves into a party
in the House of Commons, and harass whatever
party may be in power, unless the Government of
the day will introduce and pass a bill which shall
embody the programme of the Highland Law
Reform Association. Had Lord Salisbury remained
in power, possessing as he would, with the Par-
nellite support, a majority of three votes, the
Crofter narty would then have held the balance of
power.
The proceedings in connection with the
Interment of the late King Alpoonzo, of Spain,
were grimly farcical. After the coffin was placed
In the vault, the Lord Chamberlain unlocked the
coffin, then, after requesting perfect silence, knelt
down and shouted three times in the dead
monarch’s ear, “ Senor, Senor, Senor I ’ The duke
then rose, saying, “ His Majesty does not answer.
Then it is true the king isdead.” Wedon tbeheve
Alpbonzo would have answered just then even
had Dailey lashed him with a panegyric, or Dan
O’Connor afflicted him with an address of welcome
to purgatory.
Godard, the balloonist, publishes an inven-
tion that will entitle him to rank among the grand
benefactors of the race. His dynamite use ae I air
has a circumference of 5000 metres, 10 times that
of the military captive balloons of Meudon and
Calais; is applicable for reconnoitring as well as
bombarding strong places, and carries several
guns. The inventor declares that there is hence-
forth no military position, however strong, that
would be able to resist bombardment by an aerial
fleet built on the model of the “ dyoamiteuse,
which could carry several thousand kilogrammes
of projectiles and every other description ot
destructive machine.
A stranger would have imagined that the
Stuan. banquet was given in honour of the Gover-
nor or Plain Bill! When they spoke every word was
listened to in profound silence, but when the
guest of the evening was on his feet, it seemed as
if everyone wanted to talk him down —even his
ex-colleagues had not the manners to give him a
hearing. Circumstances alter cases. They Jl
listen now to the H n Daniel O Connor for hours,
talking of his descent and sudden reverses in the
pig trade; while Sandy Stuart, who has neither
place nor promise of place to give away, cannot
be endured for 10 minutes. How great is the
difference between Jaok-in-office and Jaok-out-of-
office!
Moonshine, an English weekly illustrated
paper in the Tory interest, exposes the essential
conception of the Tories in a cartoon Intended to
flout the Liberals. An English labourer, who has
at his back a Scotchman, an Irishman, and a
Welshman, confronts the typical John Bull, who,
in taking off his coat, says: “I thought I could
depend upon you, H.-)dge, but it you intend to
take sides with my three enemies (I) there, come on,
the whole lot ot you. I’m your man.” Now,
when the English labourer, tbe Scotch, the Irish,
and Welsh are represented as combined, whom
does John Bull represent? The aristocratic and
Privileged class against the British nation! Bravo!
Tory Moonshine.
We have repeatedly dealt with the merits
of the Crofter revolt against landlord oppression
in the islands of Scotland. The late general elec-
tion shows how deeo-seated is the determination
of these poor people to shake ,off, by constitu-
tional means, if possible, the tyranny under which
they suiter. Says Reynold’s Newspaper:- ‘ Even
the bare numbers of the Inverness polling are sig-
nificant. The representative of property, the
't°ry, got 2031 votes; the Liberal, 1807; but tbo
Crofter, tbe man of the people, polled nearly as
many as both combined, his votes numb* ring
3555. When this is the temper of the whole of
Scotland, sweeping territorial reforms will be
knocking loudly at the doors of the aristocracy. ’
Continental advices tell us that the Greek
fleet bad “gone into hiding ” to avoid encounter-
mgthe naval forces of the Great Powers. Now.
whera on earth—or, rather, on * ater —does a flee _
contrive to hide itself ? Have the Greeks scuttled
their vessels till the political storm blows over ?
Dr, are they secreted behind the raging billows ?
tancy the gallant Greek tars, clad in picturesque
costume, singing-
ironclads are our ships,
Hearts of Greece are our men—
The waves we like riding,
But we much prefer hiding (basso),
The fleets we can’t co-o-nquer
Shall seek us in vain.
The Skye crofters lately gave a wholesome
lesson to Lord Macdonald, who recently visited
"hstralia, and whose deer habitually make free
with their standing crops without any effort on
tbe part of that high-handed potentate or his
agents to abate the mischief. The other day,
wnen a herd of stags again broke into the en-
closures, the crofters, who were on the watch,
formed line In the rear of the animals, and drove
them into the sea, where they were slaughtered,
and carcases divided as fair prize among the cap-
tors. This fetched his lordship's steward pretty
quick, and on his reproaching the people witn
their misdeeds, they showed him the damage done
by the harts, raiused all compensation, and told
him that if any more deer came among their corn,
they would serve them the same way.
Replying to a scheme submitted to him
by a correspondent for “ squashing Parnell and all
his works,” Mr. Herbert Gladstone writes: —
•There will be no peace at Westminster until Eng-
lish parties will consent to anply constitutional
principles to Ireland, and give up the useless at-
tempt to govern Ireland without considering the
Irish people, Tories and Liberals collectively will
not unite to put down 85 members fresh from
Irish constituencies, who, in a perfectly consistent
manner, ask to be allowed to manage Irish affairs
without impairing the supremacy of the Crown
and the Imperial Parliament. Nothing cm id In-
duce me to countenance separation; but if five-
sixths of the Irish people wish to have a Parlia-
ment in Dublin tor the management of their own
local affairs, 1 say. in the name of justice and wis-
dom, let them have it.”
From the reverses suffered by the Tories
in the county elections, an iSngli 3 h Badical paper
deduces that the agriculture,! lanourer has at last
attempt d to turn on his oppressors He has dis-
covered that the landlords, his masters, are but
men, and a mean set at that While my Lord
Salisbury draws his two pounds an acre per
annum for doing nothing, Hodge, who tills his
Helds, is given a shillings for six to eight hours’
hard labour out of which he has to pay house rent
and support a wife and family. He has discovered
that toere is something wrong in this-that the
men who would seek to perpetuate it are not the
persons fitted to control the destinies of the coun-
;ry. It has dawned upon him. thanks to the
school boards, that they have but one object to
serve In soliciting his suffrage-to wit, the keep-
ing him in his present state ot helpless dependence
and poverty.
It is on matters appertaining to commerce
and currency that the Sydney Echo is at home,
speaking of a late suggestion, it says: Mr-
Morris proposes a paper currency, convertible at
the wish of the holder either into cash or bonds.
.... Of course, If there were a financial
panic, and all the banks were required at tbe same
time to cash all their notes they might be unable
to do It.” This will he news to Mr. Morris It is
just because the interconvertible paner issue he
advocates cannot be changed to cash at the wish of
the holder that we oppose it. It the Government
had cash behind their notes there would be no
occasion to issue the latter at all. Between a
“ promise to pay.” which can be changed at any
moment into cash, and one which can be ch nged
into an interest oearing Government bond only,
the Echo young man sees no difference. How
lucky some journals *re in getting masters of
finance to write for them I
It is an easy matter with some papers to
change their principles and their politics this is
not the case with several in Sydney, for it is an
Hxiomatic truth that you can t change ether wh» n
you haven’t got any, but still It is worth noticing
that, a short time ago, the ’Ebald an< Nekko
were trumpeting forth their puny pra ses of me
patriotism of sunny N S.W. Now, hear tm* little
one:—“Tbe following paragraph from Truth
may be of use to Mr. D. O'Connor, or some other
Minister who can talk when the Cabinet Is at-
tacked. It was originally applied to the Conserva-
tives of England, but with some trifling amend-
ments it will suit Mr. Dibbs and his friends:—
‘ These people cannot be in office for six months
without dragging us Into some needless military
expedition. Then they leave the Liberals to get
the country out of the mess, and to provide means
for so doing. History repeats itself.’ ” The Echo
doesn’t—it contradicts itself.
Advance Australia! Wright, Heaton, and
Co. to the fore again. For years past this fortun-
ate firm has occupied a select little spot in the
Bathurst railway yard at a ground rent so small
that It was barely worth collecting. Not long ago
some patriotic meddlers represented to the rail-
way authorities that the said ground was worth
far more than it was then let for. and so strongly
did they put the case that the Department was
forced to call for tenders for a 13 months lease.
Three tenders were then sent in, and these three
were—Wright, Heaton, and Co.. £3O; W. Paseoe,
£7O; and Mugridge Bros., £lOO. The latter, of
course, took tne prize, and the great carrying firm
had to cart off their office and about 5000 tons ot
wood as well. Had tenders been called for this
ground lease from the first, the Government, even
over a paltry little matter like this, would have
been the richer by something like £4OO or £ooo
There’s a heap of difference in the way some
patriots manage their public and their private
business.
Mr. P. M. Salmon, the Liberal candidate
for Footscray (Vic.), has the audacity to describe
the purchase oi Sir Henry Loch’s summer resi-
dence as a “ jon.” Thus the misguided Mr, Salmon
to the electors—” He considered Sir H. B. Loch to
be a very able man. and he had due respect tor his
fair lady, but he objected to banning a Governor
gdts ot this kind sirnoly because he happened to
be popular. Jf Government House was not good
enough for Sir H. B. Loch, it wasiquite time he was
asked to look out «or a summer residence outside
thecoony.” Odds, bodds! bat these are bold
words. Here we hwe M>*. S. arguing that a pub ic
servant should be treated as a private servant, and
told to look out for another piaca if he isn t satis-
fied with the quarters provided for him. This:is
too much, ann we marvel not that some ot air.
Salmon’s opponents recoil from him in horror as
“an atheist.” An atheist, as all loyal Victorians
understand the term, is a man who noesn t believe
in a—Governor.
One ol the most curious reasons for going
out on st rike we have yet heard of wm that given
by the employees at the railway workshops, in
Sandhurst, who threatened to strike because a
workman was dismissed for having organised a
testimonial to a foreman who had previously been
dismissed for intemperance. The name of the
manager who dismissed the man is Pickles and a
pretty c ise of pickles he made of it. The work-
men, after interviewing this hot-tempered gentle-
man and receiving his refusal to reinstate
testlmoniallst, refused to work. The directors of
the company then met and reinstated the man. Tt
looks as if in the not far-off future the working-
men of Victor!*, instead of being employed by
capitalists, would employ them and pay them a
percentage on their capital—and stand no infernal
nonsense from them either. The working-man
will have no need to send out the surreptitious jug
on Sundays, but will be able to keep his cellar as
well as the Capitalist—or rather the Capitalist will
then be sending out the jug. It is time there was
some change of this sort.
The diminution in the Liberal majority in
the electorates is by Reynolds’ Newspaper at-
tributed to the abandonment ot principle by the
Gladstone Administration when it commenced its
shocking Egyptian outrage which led up infec-
tiously to our own Soudan expedition, so much
applauded by the Bngl sh f’ories. Says Reynolds:
—•■ i he commeoct-ment of all this was the violent
and detestable Egyptian policy adopted by Mr.
Gladstone, at the instigation ot Sir Charles Dilke
and the T ories. The moment he took that step
which Jed to me suppression of the national rising,
to the dispersion of me soldiery that was ready to
obey Arabi’s orders, to the exile of that illustrious
patriot, the doom of Mr. Gladstone and his Minis-
try was irrevocably sea;W. ’ S'r-mge.asn t it, that
a democratic colony like NSW. sh> uld have been,
by one mans love of “glory,” inveigled into
rushing Into arms to support a Liberal Govern-
merit in the'■cry enterprise which disgraced that
Government in tb- est m stion of its most co- sts-
tfint Rtinnorters ? N.S.W. will never be safe until
its peopie have learnt d to dlsto guish its Tories
—such as Dailey—from men horn si y imbued with
the principles of Liberalism.
“Little” Mirams, who was once Berry’s
most faithful and energetic henchman, places a
different estimate on the powers and prospects ot
the quondam leader of Victorian democracy.
This is how Mr. Mirams put it to a Radical meet-
ing a few days ago“ The Liberal party started
Mr. Berry In 1877 with a majority of 05 out of a
House of 80; and now, at the end of nine years, |
for seven of which he had held office, he was j
about to take a snug billet in England, leaving his 1
party to squabble about a leader, without a pro-
gramme, and with an organisation frittered away i
i.y hla conduct. Mr. Berry was now leaving vic-
toria because he knew he was unable now to even
get a seat for himself in this colony ” For oar
part, we prefer to accept Miram’s version, and it
is only two or three weeks since Graham Berry
nlmself told the Geelongese that be was austifled
In accepting the Agent-Generalship since they
did not show any desire to re-elect him as their
representative. If the vacillating Mr. Berry really
thinks he “can again become Premier of vic-
toria," let him try It on hia return from Europe,
and he will discover he has bem living in a fool»
paradise—unless the Salvation Army is strong
enough to raise him to the Premiership,
i The “ Irish Emigrant’s Eat ewell ” patheti-
cally tells us, in language which Moores pen
alone c mid trace, the bitter sorrow felt by one
who, forced to leave the land of his birth, breathed
a sad good-bye to home and its associations. It
Tom Moore had been standing on the Murray
bridge oue day last week he would have had ms
sympathies awakened by a picture as sad and
pathetic as his noetic imagioanonconjured tor the
"Emigrant’s Farewell.’’ Mr. John Rogeis, of
Namnbota, after 37 years’ struggling as a farmer
in ‘ sunny” N.S w., has at length retreated trom
the unequal contest with land laws and capitalists,
and left the labour of half a lifetime as a monu-
ment of what energy and industry may not accom-
plish here. Under our equitable and admiranly
administered land laws he cannot, though bounded
on three sides by Crown lands, obtain enough to
provide homes for his family. The available land
is in every way suited for the purposes of the
larmer, but under ihe rule of squattocracy which
obtains the yeoman is not “in it.” John Rogers,
his wife and sons, with their goods and chattels,
have crossed the Murray southward, and pioneered
a movement which will be followed by hundreds
of the very people whom we should protect and
endeavour to retain amongst us. For this we
mey thank the land laws.
Some exceedingly good-natured friend of
Mr. James Service has written to tne Melbourne
Herald, expressing sympathy with that seit-ex-
tlnguished political light in the “ calamity which
had overtaken him.” According to the Herald
correspondent, James has ruined his health by
devotion to public affairs, which devotion “must
break down, and flna'ly destroy any man who has
not a large, well-formed brain of good quality,
much exercisedlin youth, and nourished by study.
Without pretending to know much about the size
or formation of Service’s brain, we should cer-
tainly have imagined that it was exercised in y outh
quite as freely as a lot of other men’s brains. He
had hi 3 way to make, and he made it. For atmiy,
} there were his own interests. Nor can we admit
; that a political career—especially in Victona-is
likely to prove injurious to even the meanest ot
capacities. This *ood-natured friend says: . Men

mier’s “ calamity ’ (which we now hear ot tor the
first time) to an official source, forgetting ad
about the wine and spirit business. The chances
are that fluctuations in me whisky market put a

“Decorations” on time-payment and
without deposit. Such are the advantages offered
by a London “firm” in a printed circular, ad-
dressed in strict confidence to sundry N ienna
*• houses,” on whose part a demand seems to be
anticipated. As a proof of genuineness, the firm
appeals to its 13 years’ existence and extensive
connection, especially in Germany. The extent
of its assortment and the low prices are surprising
Sixteen different “orders,” representing all the
known states of the world, including, of course,
the ideal patrimony of St. Peter, are included in
the list. The Papal orders even take the first rank,
and are distiicguished by their—aft sit omen— dirt ’
cheapness. Thus the orders of St- Gregory, St.
Sylvester, Christ, and the Holy Sepulchre are
offered at £135 eaon, whereas the Servian Order
of Jakova costs £l5O. Tne Austrian commodity,
the knight's cross of the Iron Crown at £3OOO, is
the dearest. The firm also procures patents of
nobility, baron’s, and count’s titles from the lead-
ing European states at prices ranging from £9OJ
to £3000; Court titles, from the Privy Councillor,
to the equerry, almost at a gift; and the price-list
of honorific titles and distinctions, with diplomas,
Is as extensive and varied as a Christmas baz-.ar.
Even such situations as consulates, &c., are pro-
cured ou demand, and intending applicants are in-
tormed, in "fat" print, that me inventory docs
not exhaust all the g od things obtamab e, since
the firm is continually forming new connections.

A correspondent from the FajttWest
writes an indignant letter to us concerning the
• ■ .aking-uo " of Irish outrages, ana the unfortu-
nate regularity with which Sydney papers are led
to reproduce these creations of a malicious brain
as matters ot laot. With his assertions on this
point we are unable to deal. It may he, as he
alleges, that the local dailies obtain their matter
from the Irish correspondent’s letter in the
Times,—a notoriously unreliable source; and it
may ne, as he states, that these manufactured
yarns are reproduced here as true, although
denied by every other London paper. Even
so, that is a matter beyond our sphere.
These remarks, however, from our corres-
pondent are worthy of space. He sayi
“Evidently the London correspondent or the
S.M.H. tunes himself to the key in which ins em-
plovers like him to he heard. In nis letter in *()uh
January’s issue, the writer appears to be very
bitter because he can find nothing worse against
the characters of Mr. Parnell’s supporters than
that they are poor. Ido not know that the avo-
cations ot all are as Inaccurately given as are
those of Messrs. Leahy and Jordan. Ihe former, I
am personally aware, is a large farmer, while it is
not mentioned that Mr. J. Jordan is a 1 own Com-
missioner in Enniskillen, for the representation
of whicn borough in Parliament he was but nar-
rowly beaten, in 74., by a landlord named Lord
Crichton. The gentleman who is called D bully

It Ireland naa not been sending £17.000,000 in rent,
and £8 000,000 in taxes across the Channel for so
long a time, she would, doubtless, be able now to
find richer Gilhocleis and Sheehans to represent
her. Now, however, she has to choose between
such men as have been elected, and the old and
richer representatives of rack-rents and tyranny.
-P. S. O’D,”
“ To-day a working-man member of the
House of Commons is not only an increasing pro-
bamlity—he is destined to be a dominant laotor in
English politics. No Duke of Bedford, for in-
stance 50 years hence will be allowed to pocket
the revenues of Covent-garden Market without
paying to the fctate a very substantial tithe, wh t
is mate by 1 he people must, In part, at least, be
shared by the people. This is the end and ultima-
tum of democracy, the same democracy which the
•great White Christ’ preached after He had tor
yeais supported himself by His own hands as a
carpenter in a little Judean village, and which em
mioated in the sublime advice, ‘ Sell all that thou
has I ’, and give to the poor.’ . . • The utmost
that we hope for is a fair division of the unearned
increment.’ This is certain to bo ours some day,
and that quickly approaching millenmm—tor It
will lessen taxation and increase wages—draws
nearer and nearer by every election which returns
more working men to the House. Neither by
lawyer, priest, merchant, or soldier will the battle
of the masses be won, but by the masses them-
selves. The fat Q.C., the retired colonel with
his own relations to thrust forward, the bishop
with his thousands a-year, and the merchant
hoping for eternal monopolies, have each, in
homely phrase, their ‘own axes to grind. ine
Tories are not interested, never were interested,
and never will be interested —except for their own
dirty ends—in the bettering of the masses, "hen
Lord Salisbury pays, for instance, a fair inhabited
bouse duty for Hatfield—to-day it is assessed at a
miserably inadequate rent—and in other ways
shows be has the rea* interest of our class at mart,
wo shall begin to believe that he is in earnest.
But up to tbe present there is no indication that
tne new Tory is a wblt different from the old self-
seeking one, whose every effort was to keep the
masses back, to keep them under foot, and to
compel their industry to support what John aright
called the ‘ outdoor paupers ’of tbe State. Xbe
foregoing is from a London paeer, but its sense is
perfectly applicable to Australia. The Australian
n-ople should refuse to regard Robertson or
Dibbs Bsrry or Service distinctions, and demand
of ail candidates—Are you Liberal, or merely a
gutter-bred Tory?”
The pigheaded persons who, mistak-
ing sentiment lor reason, delude themselves
into believing, because they wish so to be-
lieve, that tbe natives of Hiaoostan love British
rule, receive a hard knock irom Mr, Blunt s re-
cently published wont on India. is an ex-
tract which illustrates tbe pains the conquerors
take to make tbe vanquished natives love loreign
rule:—“ It will hardly oe credited in England, but
in this present year of grace, 1884. no hotel-keeper
in India dares receive a native guest into ms
house, not on account of any ill-will of his own,
but through fear of losing his custom.” Mr.
Blunt illustrates this by reference to “ Mohammad
All Rogay, the leading Mahommedan of Bombay.
He had travelled in Europe, and had even so iar
adopted our manners as to subscribe to all the
public charities and to drive a tour-ln-hand. Yet,
happening one day to ask him to dine with me at
my hotel, it was explained to me that this could not
be, at least, not in the public room, ‘lest the English
guests should take offence and leave the house.’
The author continues:—“ In Bengal and Northern
India things are still worse, and I think it’s not
too much to say that no native gentleman, what-
ever his rank, age, or character may be, can visit
a place of public resort, frequented by English-
men. especially if he be in native dress, without a
certain risk of insult and rough treatment. Rail-
way travelling is notoriously dangerous for them
in tb s respect.” Mr. Blunt bellev s that the
natives are as yet loyal to the British connection
—that is, knowing that independence is impossible*
they preier British to Russian or other foreign
rule. But if sullen acquiescence in our rule is not
to change into active discontent, Lord Ripons
policy of justice to the natives must be carried
out He writes:—“lf our seiflsh system of
government for our own and not for India s good
remain unchanged if we do nothing to s,cure
Indian loyalty, if we refuse to give 10 the people
that as-uranco of utt'mate selt-government which
shall enab e them to wait in patience the realisa-
tion of their hopes, if we continue to treat them
as enemies sub mod as slaves to work for u as
men devoid of rights, then it Is certain that within
a given time all the external world will appear to
th« Indians under a friendly guise, and Russia, as
being the nearest, under the most friendly.”

At Lady Carington’s last reception there
was plenty of room for ladles to quiz each other s
costumes, as the attendance was by no means so
large as upon previous occasions. To be sure,
there was, with a few exceptions, very little in
the way of ladies' gowns to please the eye, though
there was much to amuse. Lady Carington was a
complete picture in heliotrope—dress, bonnet,
parasol, and gloves all exactly of the same hue
and that delicious flower itself is hardly sweeter
than she looked. Miss Harbord was not so suc-
cessful in her costume, which consisted of a dark
navy-blue lawn, patterned with a glaring white
design; a pale-blue jabot seemed out of harmony
somehow, whilst a small black bat, with crimson
trimmings, seemed to belong to another c istume
altogether. None but a beauty would have the
courage to don such a discordant costume. Mrs.
Gullett wore an extremely beautiful dress of rich
seal-brown velvet, pannelled with old gold satin,
and over a vest of the satin a jaunty zouave
jacket of the velvet. A sprightly little American
widow, with golden hair and a hornet-like
waist, wore a rich black and white cos-
tume ; the skirt of stiiped black and white
satin draperies, and bodice of black lace;
Mrs. Dan. O’Connor a striking stone-coloured
satin elaborately trimmed with lace; Mrs. Harry
Woods, cream Madras muslin, the bodice striped
with black velvet; Lady Hay, black gown and
black bonnet, with cream feathers; Lady Martin t
green and gold brocade combined with green satin,
Mrs. Richardson, a handsome toilette of dark
green, bonnet of same colour with red plumes;
Miss Richardson, white lawn trimmed with coffee
lace, small white bonnet; Miss Dickson, pale terra
ootta trimmed with dark-green velvet, bonnet of
velvet, trimmed with terracotta plumes; Mrs.
Darley, a handsome black silk and crepe relieved
with jet; the Mieses Darley, black surah dresses
and small black tulle bonnets; the Misses Knox,
cream taaso silks heavily trimmed with lace and
bows of golden-brown ribbon velvet, small gold
wire bonnets trimmed with velvet very stylisn
costumes; Miss Mitchell, a handsome gown of
white silk trimmed with goid and white silk gauze
—Tuscan straw bonnet; Mrs. I. A. Josephs, a rich
skirt of black lace and embossed velvet mantle
covered with beads; very heavy, very hot, but
wry beautiful; MUs Joseph, a pretty cream tam-
bour muslin frock, high hat ornate with red
berries; Mrs. Angus a pretty pink embroidered
gown, high hat trimmed with clusters of
appie blossoms ; Mrs. Bouverie, cream muslin
trimmed with lace, and shot silk bonnet to corres-
pond; Miss Forbes, a light brown costume; Miss
Gore, striped crepe and brown bonnet; Mrs.
George Lord, handsome black costume; Mrs.
Airey, grenat surah and cream Maltese lace; Mrs.
Henry Mort, black costume; Mrs. C. J. Roberts,
black French blond dress, the whole front of the
skirt being richly embroidered with sapphire
moonlight beads, black lace bonnet mixed with
beads to correspond—one of the richest costumes
in the crowd; Mrs. Griffith, golden-brown satin;
Mrs. Wilfred Docker, terra-cotta satin combined
with crepe de China of same shade; Miss Kyndon,
white lawn, and rustic straw hat of navy-blue and
red, parasol of the latter hue; Misses Hardie,
coffee-coloured crepe and lace dresses, brown
straw hats; Miss Fischer, white lawn with blue
sash; Mrs. Spalding, navy-blue velvet, and silk
cream bonnet; Miss Valiant, in all cream; Madame
Kellermann, white embroidered lawn and black
tippet, light bonnet and complexion veil; Miss
Cook, pale-blue costume; Misses A. and J. Cook,
white lawn dresses. A dreadful green costume
provoked many remarks of anything but a com-
plimentary nature; and the wearer of a blaze-
coloured satin was quite celebrated, on that day
at least, for her bad taste; but there are some
people who would rather be granted such ques-
tionable notoriety than be in the background
altogether. The little Vernon boys did a lot
towards making things p sasant by their playing
and singing, and looaed quite nice in their clean
white sailor jackets and dark-blue panti. Refresh-
ments were served, as usual, in the ball-room to a
throng w> ioh appreciated them.

The Tasmanian Cup meeting, notwith-
standing a slight shower at lunch time, passed off
very successfully. The victory of Duration was
especially gratifying to the Victorians, who had
backed the favourite heavily. There was a good
attendance of ladies, and the following were a few
of the toilettes worn:—Mrs. Adye Douglass looked
very nice in a mixture of silver-green maroon,
bonnet to match; Mrs. Col. Tegge, rich black
and cardinal : Mrs. W. Degraves, particularly
quiet In olive-green; Mrs. Alexander Macgregor,
shot pink and cream; Mrs. Fleetwood Wilson
looked very nice in rich cream, trimmed with
maroon velvet; Mrs. A. Winter, the new shade of
golden-brown merveilleux, deep coffee lace, para-
sol to match; Mrs. J. Harbottle dark brown,
trimmed with cream and brown lace; Miss Har-
bottle, all white; Mrs. Ljrd, white nainsook
gown, with black velvet trimming; Mrs. D Wal-
lace wore satin, with panels of cardinal piusn.

There was but a poor attendance at the
Gaiety Theatre on Saturday afternoon, when an
entertainment was given for the benefit of the
ividow and orphans of the poor fellow who lost
his life at the new Bijou Theatre the other day.
It would be uncharitable, and perhaps unfair, to
suppose that the size of the audience testified as
to the amount of generosity of the Sydney people.
The afternoon was so intensely hot, that to sit in-
side a stuffy theatre—no matter how good the en-
tertainment might be—was simply a foretaste of
the place everybody wishes to avoid when they
die; so, doubtless, those charitable folk who in-
tended to patronise the matinee, had the weather
been a little less trying, will send in their mite all
the same to the manager of the theatre, to swell
the fund which is to benefit those who are in
such dire distress.

Sydney, Wednesday.
Dearest Belle, —l have just been reading over
your last letter, in which you ask me the reason
wby ouwmutuai friend nas' met with so little
success qpßls profession, capable, industrious, and
painstaking as he is, and I can only account for it
by tbe tact that he forgot to Italianise his name
when he commenced his career. Now, don’t
laugh, for I have it from some of our best pro-
fessional musicians that there’s a small fortune n
a foreign name. If Signor steffanl had been con-
tent to remain Mr. Stephens, I venture to say his
popularity here as a teacher of singing would have
suffered severely; and what a charm the name of
Signor Guillemlo Verdllent to Mr. William Green s
sieging I In Signor Yittorinl’s case, certainly, the
make-believe didn’t pass, seeing that there are
several men in Sydney who went to school in
Victoria with Mr. Victor. I well remember when he
made his ilrst appearance as a singer here. We were
waiting all expectant to see the sallow-faced, long.
Clack-haired Italian come on and make his bow,
when, just as the singer approached—neither sal-
low-faced, long, nor black-haired—we received no
slight shock, when one amongst our party ex-
claimed, “Well, upon my word, if that isn t
Gt orge (at least 1 think it was George) Victor,
my old school-fellow I ” Later on, we learnt that
When he left school, he visited Italy, and came back
Italianised iu name, if not in voice; but, as I said
before, the make-believe was in this case too evi-
dent. But the last example is quite an exception
to tbe general rule, for I do assure you there is a
big capital in a delicious vo welly Italian name for
eithe performer or teacher, and there is not the
slightest doubt that our friend’s worldly prospects
weie not a little blighted owing to nts scorn for
this piece of innocent humbug, this my dear, is
the only reason I can give tor his failure.
We made sure the wet weather had come to stay
for at least a w*ek when the rain came down in
such torrents on the night of the Philharmonic
concert, and dlsappoin ed as we were that, on
acDumotlhe said rain, we couldn’t attend the
concert, we tried to assure ourselves that we
were unselfish y glan, for the sake of the poor
farmers aud squatters- that the grass was g <ing
to have a chance of life just when it was nearly at
its last gasp; but just to show how we deceive
ourselves, we were diSvraceiully delighted when
tae clouds wrapped themselves up and left
a tidy sky in nice lime for the reoeptb n
on Thursday afternoon at Government House.
It wasn’t such a brilliant reception as the former
ones, but so very many people are out of town,
then not a few of our notables went on to the
American steamer, which ielt the same afternoon,
ro wish sir Alexander Stuart bon voyage. Sir
Alfred Stephen absented himself from Govern-
i ment House for the above purpose, and we quite
I missed the sight of this wonderiully energetic old
gentleman escort! og Lady Carington ab ut the
gardens. I wonder whose idea it was to have
so many of the lounges at Government House up-
holstered with orange-coloured satin I It’s little
I short of cruelty to expect us girls to sit upon
mem, and 1 declare, dear, I didn't see three out of
twenty who were hardy or thoughtless enough to
recline on these fearful complexion tests, come
out of the ordeal with flying colours. One portly
dame, who was seemingly under the impression
that this primary colour lent additional glory to
her already gorgeous apparel and florid com-
plexion, fixed herself upon one for the whole
afternoon, a d caused not a little amusement by
tbe comical picture she made. Her royal blue
gown elaborately bede ked with moonlight bead
trimming, bronze chenille cape, tremendously
high bonnet trimmed with blue and bronze
plumes, and highly coloured complexion, backed
by this awful orange satin, add to this a look of
the supremest self-satisfaction, and there you
have her in all her gaudy completeness. If it had
not been for this amusing dame, and for the en-
tertainment afforded us in observing the “ fish out
of water ” kind of comportment of some of the
people (the men especially), the reception would
have been rather tame. As it was, ho wever, the se
few amusing trifles just saved it.
You ask methe meaning of a “Wooden Wed-
ding,’’ but surely you know it is simply the
fifth anniversary of a wedding day, and that it is
customary to send souvenirs in wood upon this oc-
casion to the happy pair. In Paris, the other day,
a lady sent out her wooden wedding invitations,
printed on wood as thin as wafers. For myself, I
believe the celebration of wooden, silver, and
golden weddings is simply an excuse for a jollifi-
cation, or probab'y as a means to run in some
more presents It must be quite nice to have
one’s household goods replenished gratis every few
years. Very pretty trays, cruets, dinner-mats,
and the like are made in wood now-a-days, ana
are quite good style, so be sure you don’t forget
to apprise me of your wooden wedding-day and
I’ll send you something appropriate. I will not
wait so long, however, to send you some of the
oddest little things possible, which the French call
oulstitis, and which are simply morsels of plush
made into tiny monkeys, and are really the latest
fashionable drawing-room fad. They are stuck
upon lustres, pictures, window-curtains, or any-
thing they can be made to cling to and look
exactly as if they were climbing. Trifles as they
are, they are rather ingenious, and the inventor
has made quite a fortune by them. They hap-
pened to take the popular fancy, so, as no.drawing-
room at home is complete without them, you may
imagine the sale of them totalled a very large
amount. They are just making their appearance in
the fancy-goods shop-windows here, but nobody
seems to know what they are for—whether they
are Intended as play-things for children, ornaments
for hats, or what I tell you beforehand so that,
when you get your bundle of plush monkeys in all
colours of the rainbow, you will not be puzzled to
know what position they are to fill in your domes-
tic circle.
I was not a little amused the other night when I
dropped Into the cloak-room of the New Masonic
Had to hear the “lady who looks after the cloaks”
exclaim, in an inspired voice—“ Well, that is too
bad I That is the sixth lady who has come into the
room and righted herself bel ore he glass without
leaving her wraps ” The poor woman’s grievance
w-s that as these economical ladies carried their
cloaks into the hall with them she had not the
slight st chance of being feed. I think there
shouli be some reform about this cloak-room
business, fo r as matters stand at present the atten-
dant's remuneration for her trouble is for the
greater part dependent upon the generosity of the
ladies, and I grieve to say, dear, that more than
half of them quite forget to leave any fee at all.
T ey seem to think the honour theyjconfer on the
attendant by allowing her to take care of their
wraps is enough in itself. I think it there could
be a settled fee it would be more satisfactory all
round. At some of the fasnionable theatres at
home a lady cannot look at herself in the mirror
under sixpence, and I remember hearing of a
newly-mar (led beauty who, upon rejoining her
husband after visiting the cloak-room, oompl ined
bitterly to him that she had only just gianced in
the looking-glass to see that her hair was un-
ruffled, tor which privilege she was charged six-
pence. The husband, who hadn’t then passed the
complimentary stage, replied-” Well, my dear,
I am sure the sight of the picture you saw in the
mirror was worth a hundred times as much
But I feel certain that, provided we had decent
civil attendants in our theatre and concert-room
eioak-rooms (some of them are awfully testy)
none of us would begrudge a reasonable fee. It
makes ail the difference to us if the cloak-minder
be the happy possessor of a good temper and a
civil tongue. I know Igo into the room at the
Theatre fioyai with a light heart, knowing, as I do
by long experience, that I shall receive the ut-
most patient attention, jJput not so at one or two
other places of amusement. At one In particular,
If we seem to be at all in £ hurpy to claim our
w-aps, or, woful calamity 1 happen to lose our
ticket, we are certain of a good downright gpoid-
ing from the attendant, which to poor timid crea-
tures (like me, my dear)is something horrible.
Fancy being soundly rated before a roomfull i f
people for showing signs of hurry or for having
lost a paper ticket! This is no exaggeration, but
a simple, mournful fact, and besides experiencing
it myself, several of my friends have complained
of it to me. It will end in this—that unless a
change is effected we shall sever patronise the
cloak-room at ali, those few places
where we feel certain of meeting with civility.
Are you glad to best that cricket is to be the
future fashionable pastime for us of the weaker
sex ? I don't quite know yet bow we shall like it,
but at ail ever ts it will be a change from the eter-
nal lawn-teonis—a nice game in its wav, but ever
so much overdone. There is a ladies’ cricket club
formed here now, and when they play their first
public match I will tell you ali about it. One
thing is certain—there will have to be a special
dress invented for the game. No girl could ever
ever run as we are, ordinarily ciad, with crtnolette
and all the rest of the impedimenta. A costume
was adopted for a ladies’ match played lately in
Surrey, which consisted of a white tuniq, JSton
blue caps and sashes, black hose and white knicker-
bockers. We must have something more pic»
turesaue than that here, and more-more—well,
more feminine. The knickerbockers and hose would
frighten everybody off here, whatever they might
do in Surry. We colonials are not only too proper
to adopt such an attire, but we are, as a rule, so very
angular that I am certain we should not look at
all nice. Perhaps this last reason would prove to
he the strongest deterrent against the mannish
garb.
There was a meeting of Americans at the Asso-
ciation grounds last Saturday for the purpose of
forming a base-ball club. This, as perhaps you
know, is the American national game, and is (at
least, so they say) a far finer game in many respects
than our cricket. However, they have yet to
prove that to us. But whether it is a better game
or not, we shall he very glad to have a change,
and shall look forward to witnessing their first
public play.
A good way to renovate your cream nainsook
dress is as follows:—Pour two quarts of boiling
water on a pound of bran, strain the bran water
through a muslin bag, and after washing the
dress in tepid water rinse it through the bran
water, and, when dry. It will be both nicely stiff
and a pretty colour. Now, run along ma belle,
and do this your own self, for not only will it be
proper y done, but tbe bran will make your hands
nice and white. Teil me in your pext how you
succeeded, and in the meantime, bysjieve spue
to be YouiS, aa.oy.er,

We have dropped across some mean men
in our time, hut the man we saw at Foley S f baths
last Sunday morning must “take the cake. He
backed himself for live boh to stay under water
longer than a young gentleman who rather fancied
himself at the business, and after preliminaries
had been arranged the pair took a header to-
gether. The mean one, however, immediately
rose to the surface, and waited for his opponent
who stayed down till human nature could stand it
no longer. As the victim rose to the surface the
ioker went down, and to the victim s chagrin
stayed down some 30 seconds, and he duly annexed
the "sugar.” * *
Mr. Fletcher’s celebrated piece of umpir-
ing goes far to show that the time has arrived
when the business may with advantage be en-
trusted to professionals, as in England. The post
is one requiring peculiar faculties tor its
tory performance, and good men when found
should be retained. It wpuld certainly he a good
idea to attach two umpires to the ground staff
during the cricket season.

rushed away In such a hurry lost a treat not to be
bought the other side ot tne border. Footy
Pearce, tne well-known sculler and fisherman,
and his net were in great requisition, and the
greater number of the picmsers passed away the
time in trawling and half-drowning one another,
till the arrival of Mr. Speaker, when quite a chill
fell on the crowd upon the discovery that the
" Jaynlal” had been left behind. After dinner,

Our readers probably expected to have
seen in this issue of The Bulletin the terms and
condition* of the Farnan-Foley and Newton-loley
fights. We regret to be obliged to state that there
is very little likelihood of a match being made,
neither of the Victorians evincing any undue
eagerness to toe the mark. We would have been
glad to have seen the men meet, not so much tor
the sake of the sport, as of deciding quickly who
is the best man in the colonies. It is but just to
Foley to state that though the primary challenge
did not emanate from him, he has thrown no
obstacle in the way of the Melbourne fighters.
Their own terms were accepted and expenses
(£25) offered them, and as a further inducement
the local man allowed the winner to take two-
thirds of the gate money and a stake off-100, in
the event of Foley winning, he was willing to let
the loser off with half the stake. We have thus
fully explained the terms that our readers may
understand the matter, which we shall not again
allude to until the money Is actually put up.
Foley is now in treaty with Dempsey and Cleary,
the American thumpers, and has offered induce-
ments te Mitchefi, which wifi probably ensure a
visit from him. Should either of them come out,
he is willing to try conclusions with him. We
may yet hope to see a cnampionship fight in the
ring, not in the columns of newspapers—a childlso
Pen-and-ink battle of which the public, as our-
selves, are, doubtless, heartily sick.

Connors, who, a week ago, distinguished
himself by throwing one of Foleys bears in a

of a reputation. Hassan has an unbeaten reeprd

too, carries an unbeaten name. The match wifi he

O’Brien has forwarded his deposit for the
match with Malone, to come off on the 36th Inst.
By some error the amount was forwarded to the

recent issue, win be haif-mile, 10U0 yarcs, and
three quarter mile.

Bees, who recently defeated Farnan in a
Stove encounter in Melbourne, has challenged
feter Newton, AbeHlcken, or Bifiv Farnan. So
far, nothing definite has been arranged. Probably
another newspaper fight is pending with its con-
sequent cheap advertisements. We would like to
see more business and less talk in these matters.
Our champion Victorian pugilists seem a very
threadpapery lot, with much less fight in them
than the average larrikin.

At the Gymnasium, George-street, Syd-
ney. on Saturday night, a very merry entertain-
ment was witnessed, prot ably the best series or
encounters which has yet taken place in the hall
The first turn-up was between Gorman and
Fuller and for three rouuds the men male thiags
particularly lively for one another, and interest-
ing to the audience Occasionally Gorman would
drop hotly and heavily on to the other mans
counter, and the change was willingly and speedily
dealt out to him. There was very little jibbing
or fooling between the combatants. They don’t
know enough to be cunning, so they fought a fair
give-and-take battle, which, judging by thy
llberallappiaute bestowed, wes fomewhat appreci-
ated by the onlookers. In the last round both men
were evidently tiring, the blows were less
“Ipowdery,” and ihey retired to mate way for
Hickey and Burrldge, who fought a merry battle,
ending slightly in tavour of the last named. The
set-to of the evening was by Dooley and Nolan.
The latter is anew arrival, with a short neck, bull
chest, and an English reputation. After four
rounds with Dooley he had a cut lip, a crimson
tinted nose, taud a colonial record which he will
not exhibit when r>n tour. Do ley will make a
rattling boxer; he has a good left hand, and a long
reach; his right is slow, and fails short occasion-
ally. He throws away chances through not fol-
lowing his left up quickly, and unless he is care-
ful to correct this error, he will develop
into a one-handed fighter, Jimmy Laws m
and Davis were the next to don the mit-
tens. Davis is a good man; he fought a two-
hour’s draw with Dooley, and Lawson, who is
the best man at his weight in the colonies,
was a fitting antagonist for him. He fitted him
very often., Lawson is quick, uses both hands,
and can afford to lend his head occasionally on the
chance of getting in a wind-jammer. During the
two rounds they fought he made the vicinity of
hia left hand a desirable point for his opponent to
avoid, and being short he occasionally got in under
Davis’s guard to lodge a hasty deposit of both
hands full, dodging away in time to avoid taking
a receipt. M’Kenna and a friend wound up the
entertainment with a very lively three rounds of
good work ©n both sides, Mac. scoring most points
in the game. Professor Cansdell gave an interest-
ing exhibition of Indian club swinging during the
evening. Tne sparring was under tne personal
supervision of tde proprietor, and we did not re-
mark any violation of the rules of the gymnasium
during the evening. Why should one man stand
eo prominently out in an assemblage as an en-
forcer of good order and unity and brotherly
Jove ? We do not know. Gladstone holds a mul-
titude ia check with his voice, Dan. O Connor
holds them with his glittering eye,; but Foley
holds his audience in the hollow of his hand by the
cunning of his arm, and yet he is harmless as an
unweaned child. We would sooner be a crack
pugilist than a cracked Prime Minister if we had a
mob to manage.

The Hon. James White’s remarks about
the prejudicial effects of early racing upon two-
year-olds are only an echo of the protests of many
horse-owners in the old country. Uniortunateiy,
the very gentlemen who profess to have the moat
faith in their theory seldom put it into practice.
Mr. White, for instance, says that he was entirely
opposed to the introduction of the Kichmond
Stakes, “ although he had had the good fortune to
win the first race of the kind.” Lord Falmouth,
again, who has won more money by two-year-old
racing than any other man that ever lived, has
given his opinion that this early training of horses
is iojurious to their future prospects. There can
be little doubt that if the valuable prizes for two-
year-olds were abolished, and no inducement held
forth to owners to run their best youngsters,
the stamina of thoroughbred horses would be
better developed. But so long as there is a lot of
money and glory to he won by sacrificing prin-
ciples, owners will go for the “ greed.” The
English two-year old, the Bard, has won more
than £9OOO in stakes during the past season. His
owner, Mr, Peck, a practical trainer, probably con-
siders that no juvenile should be brought out lor
16 races. But as the average value of each event
was more than £SOO, Mr. Peck couldn’t resist the
temptation of winning it. Let the big prizes that
are now offered tor youngsters be reserved for
/cmr-year-olds, and there will be some encourage-
ment for owners to practise the virtue of path nee
with their blood-stock. It is because there are so
few valuable stakes to be won with horses after
their third year that they are made too much use
of in their young days As for the pretty numer-
ous class of owners who would say that they
couldn’t afford to keep two-year-olds idle, well—
the turf is oetter without them By all means let
the Hon. James White endeavour to restrict tw
year-old rasing, or what is better still, abolish it
altogether Not by Jockey Club law, but oy the
simple method of making it a paying game not to
race youngsters.

The Selection Committee in connection
with the intercolonial eight oar race have lost no
time in picking a crew to represent N.S.W. Nine
men were chosen, including Mr. B. P. Simpson,
and, as we hear it is unlikely that gentleman will
take a seat in the boat, the eight may be looked
for in Messrs Martin, Brett, Beule, Pickering, and
Hobertson from the M.R.C.; and Bros, Kennedy,
and Johnson irom the S.R.C. Tne crew is a flrst-
cUss one, and the Selection Commi tee may be
congratulated upon having put together the beat
possible eight from the material at their disposal.

W. G. George, at present in New York, is
reported to have said that he had gained 2010.
Since crossing the Atlantic, and “ now felt as well
as ever he felt in his life.” George is evidently of
opinion that he was drawn too fine f r his matches
against Cummings, and if the projected leturn
matches with the Paisley champion come off
George is cert .in to carry a little more beef than
in his first essays. Whether he will be able to
turn the tables on Cummings to be seen,
but before quitting the states George may be
having another cut in against his old companion,
Myers. When they met, more than three years
ago, at the half, threequarters, and one mile,
Myers won the first event, but lost the rubber.
Tne Americans think that he was drawn too fine
on that occasion.

Buyers of high-priced yearlings will be in-

Billiards are, like humanity, subject to
the laws of evolution. The game was pmyed i.
Shakespeare’s time, and for centuries made no
progress. It then evolved a Roberts, who playea
It as a man might do coming from another planet.
In no other game could one man give all comers
such odds as he did, and win. The son ms, how-
ever, snuffed out all the lather's performances
and stands now to billiards as much as young
Vanderbilt did to old Vanderbilt, and to all other
millionaires, tor money-getting. The details ot a
lately-played billiard match in London show that
the game oan no longer be interesting. Who
would not tire of looking on at a game in which
one player (Peall) makes a break of 1003, with
other breaks similarly lame? We pain nait-a-
sovereign, when the elder Roberts was hem, to see
him play a game of 1000 up, which, by the wry,
lasted over four hours. They play matches of
30,000 now 1 It is strange that no other game of
skill has brought up such improved plaj ers as are
now to be found at the >l board of green cloth.”

Quite a neat little case of diamond cut
diamond is reported to have occurred at a recent
race meeting in N S.W. It appears that the
owner of a certain flyer was thrown over by his
jockey at the last moment, and was worrying
himself into fits to get out of the trouble when
he dropped across another pigskin-straddler who
had been in his employ before. The race came
off, but even a blind man could see that the
“ emergency ” jockey “rode with a heavy rein,’
and deliberately did his level best to run a good
last. On returning to the paddock, the horse was
handed back to the owner by the rider with the
terse remark: “Now, you and me are quits until
the next time.” Those who know, explain the
business by the fact that the horse owner had
engaged the same lad on a previ ous occasion, ad
although the latter rode live races well, he could
never sse the colour of the former’s money.

Since Raskin began to break up, have
never dared hope to enjoy such a piece of gorge-
ous word-painting as we find in the Melbourne
Herald telegram of the 33rd January, from the
Association Ground, None but a master of his
craft would turn out this sort of copy: “When
the chosen champions of the sphere and willow
met to-day to pit themselves in friendly but
stubborn rivalry in defence of the intercolonial
cricket honour, it was under circumstances cal-
culated to satisfy the most exacting of cricket
enthusiasts. The nig glowing sun poured down
its enlivening rays in waves of heat which would
have been wearyingly oppressive had it not been
that a gentle breeze tempered the sun s over-
genial Influence into toleration. There was
pleasant excitement as the time approached for
the opening of the play. The coin was sent spin-
ning into mid-air,” &c. Our brain grows dizzy as
we strive to form a faint idea of what this re-
porter could accomplish at a prize-fight. Yet we
blame him for restricting his fiery fancy to mere
prose description of the scene. Let him send off
his next telegram in verse. We will make a
feeble attempt to supply the literary jewels of the
Herald man with a rhythmical setting:
The sun is glowing brightly—
Pouring down its waves of heat
On the muslins blowing lightly
Round the ladies’ little feet;
And gently o’er our faces
Sweeps the kindly, tempering breeze
As we softly take our places
And ioil back at languid ease.
We watch the coin a-spinning,
Each mortal holds his breath
As he wonders who is winning—
For the toss is “ sudden death;”
Both sides are on their mettles.
So a mighty shout assails
The shilling as it settles,
When the cry is “ New South Wales!”
Then wicketwards walk proudly
Young Jones and Percy Mac ,
And the people cheer them loudly;
But the “demons 'brow is black
As the ball he sends a-bowling
(H ow it glistens in the sun I)
To the b undary goes robing.
And M’Donald’s score is one.

There were some unsavoury proceedings in
connection with a trotting mated between Rosalie
and The Ruler at the last Elsternwlck Park meet-
ing, The match was run off in three heats of a
mile each. For the first heat sto 1 was laid on The
Ruler, who won. but in the succeeding heats
Rosalie asserted her superiority io the most un-
mistakable manner. At the conclusion of this
very entertain!' g match the crowd hooted the
driver of The Ruler. The system of running a
match in heats gives opportunities for this in and
out running. It there were only one race the
poor ouiside backers would, at any rate, 1 se only
one wag«r. Some of them Jest three over the
Rosalie-Ruler match.

As an instance of the extensive character
of turf gambling in England it has been calculated
that had a backer been lucky enough (»t the last
Manchester meeting), the extraordinary amount
of £1,453,888,133 Bs. would have been realised by the
investment of a sovereign “ played up ” on each
winner.

Gatien, was offered to the uomte de Nicolai for
£IOO, but the telegram accepting the offer was not
received by the o»aer or tne pair owing to his
absence from home. Then the youngsters were
sent to the French TattersaH’s, and one of them,
Plaisanterie, was knocked down for £33 to Tom
Carter, son of Carter the trainer, .before she
started for the Cmsarewich, £6OOO was offered and
refused tor Plaisanterie. Who shall s*y there Is

An extraordinary circumstance in connec-
tion with a recent English breach of promise suit
was the fact that although there were over 100
love letters produced as evidence, they did not
contain a single term of endearment, and no one
of them had any mention of kieses. What on
earth can they have been written for ? A laay
might as well try to write a letter without a post-
script as a man try to write a love letter without
gliding into the usual nyum-nyum business. The
name of love letter in such a case is a misnomer.

[FOR THE BULLETIN]
Jack tlerrington was stockman on a run called
Nintingbool.
And close besioe the homestead stood the station
childrens’scnool;
A little blue-eyed maiden taught tbe young Idea
to shoot,
And from the tree of knowledge helped them
pluck the early fruit.
One morning, as Jack backed an ugly big buck-
damping screw.
He heard the youthful voices chanting, “One an<
one make two.”
“ I b’lleve; ihey’re right,” he muttered, as he gave
his nag a turn;
I d like to go to Mary’s school, where figures {
might learn.
And ask her, kind o’ quietly—(you cripple, you’ve
begun Ij—
If just a sort o’ ’casional, don’t one and one make
one
Wo-ho-opI you fiddle-headed —” “Sh, Jack, you
t mustn’t swear.”
“Oh, beg y’r p'a’d’n, Mary, why, I thought yoi
was in there;
These brumby s is a tryin’ lot, they gives a fellow
cause *
I wouldn t swore out loud, though, If I’d know-
how near you was;—
Whoopi can't he buck? The outlaw, he’s tryin’
to prove it’s true
What them your g uns was a singing ’bout—one
and one make two-
He wants to spread me out somewhere and count
it up himself,
But a china horseman’s on him—this" child ain’t
the common delf.
Whoo-roopl he's off—good mornin’ . She’s a
pretty little thing;
1 >arn me, 1 think I’ll muster pluck to speak about
the ring,
But I’m so confounded bashful that I wouldn’t
r have the cheek.
Though I sit and yahber to her every evening in
the week.”
“ Say, Mary, if a girl ain’t wed we got to call her
Miss.”
“Yes, Jack.” “That’s so; now, what I want to
say is simply this:
When unmarried sisters meet we speak of them as i
‘misses,’
And when a chap is married then bis wife becomes
his‘missus’
You taught them little folks this mornin’ one and
one make two.
And that, as far as figures go, is nothing less than
true;
But, Mary, little woman, there’s a gent now on the
run
Whose got a patent way of provin’ one and on
make one;
He knows the other secret—(Jack here stole sun
dry kisses) -
He’s got a patent way to make a single maiden
missus.'
Shall we two learn the secret ?” Came the answer
shyly back—
‘There, you're rumpling all my collar” —
[Mem. to printer.—Asterisks, please, you know]
. . . . “ We will Itarn the secret Jack. ’
At the dinner given by the Melbourne
Irishmen to Dr, O’Doherty, the other night, the
noble doctor remarked, among other things, that
“ He hoped that when Ireland had her ownParila
ment, and her manufactures flourished, her linen,
hose, woolens, stout and whisky would be largely
used In Australia.” It is a patriotic hope, but wi
fear the stout and whisky part of it will mak.
the doctor disliked by the Good Templars. Litth
Mirams has been heard to say that there will neve:-
be an Irish Parliament while he can prevent it. If
this is to be its game. The Irish nation can rely
upon our custom, anyhow. By the way, the
Honorable Tom Slattery was at the banquet, anc
—the Honorable Dan. O’Connor was not! Wha:
obscure and gory mystery underlies this fact?
Perhaps the Jaynil thinks “ pathrlotissem ” hat
paid him well enough up to date, and that now he
is a “ Ministher av the Crown ” it is time to drop it
They were riding in a railroad oar when
the first man, who was evidently suffering from e
recovery, leaned over to the second man, and
said:—“ Lord Carington was right after all. If a
man wants to prosper he must keep strictly sober,
and pay proper attention to his business. Even
Solomon, with all his glory, and all his 900 mothers
in-law to advise him, couldn't improve on that lot
I, for one, h ive ac'ed on the advice, and find I'm
all the better for it. I drink no intoxicating stuff
whatever, and the result is I am at my work wli h
a cool head and a strong arm by 9 o’clock every
morning ’ “ Since when did this change in you take
place ? ” asked the second man. “ Since when ? ’
exclaimed the other; “ why, since to-morrow. You
couldn’t expect a man to run the teetotal ticket
on the glorious anniversary of his country s
founding, could you ?” And then hauling out
his pocket-pistol, the first man poured out two
tots of perfumed water, and the pair drank suc-
cess to Australia, coupled with the name of
Carington.
How quickly some city fashions are
adopted in the country. Mr. Dennis O’Phillagin,
who has lately been appointed. Inspector of Nuis-
ances to the Borough Council of Boggarawoggara,
was entertained at a banquet last Saturday by his
numerous supporters and friends. The proceed-
ings were quite on wriggle, and the festive board
groaned beneath the delicacies of the season, in-
eluding sucking pigs and slap-jacks, pickled emu
tails, and fricasseed tree frogs. In responding to
the toast of “ Our Guest,” Mr. O’Phillagin treated
the distinguished company present to a full and
particular history of his early life. Including bit
trials and triumphs as a sundowner for many
years, his subsequent election to the important
position of deputy sub-scavenger to the road
trust, his undeniable loyalty in a strict observance
of the Government stroke, and finally his eleva-
tion to the exalted office oi Inspector of Nuisances,
As a self-educated man, who could write his name
legibly and spell January if tney only gave him
time, he aspired to a much higher position. He
hoped they would all profit by his example, and
then they might all achieve some sort ot eminence,
if it were only on the cross beam of the leafless
tree, or be shrined in the immortal verse of a pan-
tomime libretto.
The story comes to us from Maryborough
(Vio.), but we prefer telling it in our own way. Near
the town named there Jives a person who has on
his ground a pond stocked with fish. When not.
occupied In anything himself his time his spent in
loitering round to see that no o. e.sa fishes there
One day last week some of his neighbours deter-
mined to be even with him. For this purpose
they constructed a dummy swagman, fixed it on
the margin where the water was deepest, filled its
pockets with stones, put a fishing-rod in its hands,
and lay in the adjoining scrub to watch results.
Sudjlenly A. (the churlish owner) appeared on his
balcony, and swept the welkin with his eye till it
rested on the supposed poacher. Then he called
his family, and callously remarked: “ Guess
I’ve caught ’im at last—see me fix ’im.” Then
he left the house in his shirt - sleeves,
and, creeping warily, stealthily, relentlessly
behind the stolid simulacrum, rose alongside it
with a whoop and sent it head foremost into SO
feet of water. It sank without a murmur and re-
gained so long below that the women rushed
from the cottage with flying hair and poured out
cries for aid on the bosom of the palpitating air'
A. got nervous. The preservation of fish scarcely
justified the taking of life, and Victorian
juries had primitive views on the difference be-
tween manslaughter and murder. He plunged in,
and after the third dive brought the poor stranger
to the surface. He placed him on the bank and
took a long look at his face. Then he straightened
nimself with an uncanny yell, and started like a
meteorite for the most secluded glade in the forest
primeval, pursued by the harsh mockery of es-
tranged neighbours. Anyone can fish in that pond
now.
The vicar of Saltney (Eng.), when asked
f rhia vote by a Liberal candidate, replied—“No,
air; I cannot vote for you. All Liberals are either
humbugs or liars.” “There is,” says Truth, in
quoting the incident, “no respectable wording
man who would have disgraced himself by making
such an offensive remark. Yet we are told that
one great argument in favour of the Established
Church is that it maintains ‘ a gentleman in every
parish to refine the manners of the people.’ ”
Fling up your three hats, Isaac, and jingle
your three balls, Solomon I A Jew has married
into the Royal Family of England. There la no
doubt of it, A French paper has taken the trouble
to hunt up the genealogy of Prince Battenberg.
It is not a flattering one. The name of his uncle
was Haucke—a good name for a Jew. Unele
Haucke was a Russian spy. He entered the Russian
Imperial service as a page, and subsequently
threw up his situation to join the Poles in their
unsuccessful rising in 1861-3. During the time
Uncle Haucke was fighting for bleeding Poland
che Russian General, Mouravelff, knew every-
hing of what was going on where Uncle
Haucke was. It subsequently transpired that
Uncle Haucke was specially employed by
che Russian Government as a spy. After
his. Uncle Haucke went to Prance with tte
intention, no doubt, of living there in luxury to a
: reen old ago on tne fruits of his noble conduct.
Hut he made a mistake in this. The Po es might
ot be able to overthrow their Russian tyrants,
■ut they could put a head on Uncle Haucke. And
cney did. He was found one day with a hole
through his chest and a sweet smile on hla face.
The hole exactly fitted a revolver-bullet. This
French paper says that “ it does not seem prudent
for English Cabinet Ministers to let him (Batten-
berg) assume a confidential position beside the
Queen,” because, it goes on to say: “It is very
profitable to do secret service work of an impor-
tant kind for Russia.” Imagine Battenberg coming
home gloomingly one day and saying to Beatrice:
“ Bee. this kind of thing can’t go on. I’ve had to
smoke tuppenny cigars for the last fortnight, and
I tried to touch Teck for a half-crown this morn-
ing, but it was no use. He told me he hadn’t seen
half-a-crown for a month, and the milkman had
issued a distress warrant against him. He asked
me if I would back a bill for him for two ‘ quid.’
I said I would if he would go halves. He agreed,
and I did it, hut when we went to the money-
lenders they laughed at us, and one said if we
didn’t clear out suddenly he would send for a
policeman. Of eourse we cleared out, and then
Teck went round to a Jew he knew, and this Jew
said he could only advance us 7a. 6d. oe it—the
risk was too great for any more Teck said he
would take that. Then we divided, and spent the
old sixpence in a drink. I've brought home
fcfiree bob. I couldn't do any more, Bee.” Then
Beatrice replies—“ Web, dear, I suppose I’ll have
to take the ’bus to the Palace and pump mother
for some more political secrets.” The French
paper (Le Gaulois) winds up with the grim re-
mark “Mons.ce Lessar will, doubtless, keep a
close eye on this Royallsed person with a view of
studying his capabilities as a conscious or uncon-
scious instrument.” But perhans this is only their
French fun.

to get Wolfe's Schnapps. WIUJ
No case of affection of the throat or lunas
exists which cannot be greatly relieved by the use

The Patriot
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When honest, upright means of living fail.
And nought’s before but hunger, or the gaol,
One path remains, that leads to wealth and fame,
If well and boldly played—the patriot game.
In every role to act a leading part
Requires some brains, if not an honest heart;
But Nature, in a sportive mood, decreed
That minus both the Patriot may succeed.
11 A man must serve his time to learn his trade,”
But Patriots never—they are ready-made.
To acquire his art much pains a snob must take;
A fool or knave off-hand a law can make.
If, after years of toil, you still are poor.
And see the wolf for ever at the door,
As a last chance try on the Patriot dodge—
Become a member of an Orange lodge,
Also some big man’s har ger-on. and tout.
And, if you will, of Ten perance loudly spout.
Keep yourself well before the public eye,
“ The People’s Cause!” for ever be your cry.
Crawl, wriggle, Halter— show a furious zeal
On all occasions for the Common Weal
At nothing stick to ravish power and pelf;
But 1 hen in public always sink yourself.
A seat in Parliament will compensate
For all the meanness of your present state.
What pickings wait the lucky Patriot there!
Yet should this prove "A Castle in the Air,”
Your zeal Ingratitude should never quench—
You’ll serve a thankless country on the Bench.
For principles let simpletons contest;
Your motto be—Whatever pays is best.
As one your interest; and your country’s view,
A BAD SHOT.
HE (with sentiment): "AH, MY DEAR MISS DE POTZPOYNT. WHY HAD I NOT THE GOOD
FORTUNE TO KNOW YOU FIFTEEN YEARS AGO?” GOOD
SHE: “HOW RIDICULOUS! I WAS THEN ONLY TWO YEARS OLD. (Reflects also that
"Par" was then only relail.” and that she wore soiled pinny and nuse.)
Thus, when you serve yourself, you serve her, too.
Observe all changes of the public mind,
Change with the change, and never Jag behind.
This is the one great art to rule a State—
The people’s wishes to anticipate.
No art is easier than to govern man,
They may he led, as sheep are to a pen.
If a straw's held before a donkey’s nose,
He’ll follow that,—where’er you go. he goes.
The people can be had with equal ease,
And once they’re pleased, you draw them where
you please;
As babes with pap, with flattery they’re fed I
Then feed them full,-from them’s your daily
bread.
Their power, prudence, wit, and wisdom praise,
And, above all. soft-soap their present craze.
When frenzied envious r'vals round you rave.
And call you traitor, windbag, fool, or knave.
Never despair!—the poor man s candidate
Has often lived to steer the Ship of State.
If by a wicked Press bowled out and lashed,
Assume a face of brass—don’t be abashed.
Audacity the people always wins.
And, like some virtues, covers many sins.
Protest your innocence with oaths and tears,
Recount the services of bygone years,
And, above all, the Christian part act well,
Forgive your foes, but wish them all in Hell.

“A Family of Seven Burned to a Crisp,”
is the descriptive heading of a par. about a Are in
an American journal.
W. Q. George, the ex-amateur crack run-
ner of England, is at present on a visit to the
States, ostensibly for the sake of his health, hut as
he has offered to run L. B. Myers a series of live
races, it does not look as if he will object to an-
nex a few Yankee dollars.
The Melbourne Club should certainly re-
serve to themselves the right of naming the cap-
tain of the team about to visit England, for it is
necessary that a captain of the Australians should
be conversant in other matters than cricket, and
judging by the light of recent events, they can-
not boast of many such across the border- Should
be be picked in the team, the right man for the
place is Tommy Hor , but perhaps it is as well
not to mention names.
Ed. Hanlan submitted the following
letter to a reporter, as showing something of the
character of John Teemer. Toemer’s letter from
Hanlan was not put In“M'Keesport, Pa., June
39.—Friend Hanian,—l am well and hope that you
and your familie are the same. I hope that every-
thing is rite you and I will row a race. lam shur
that we can make ton thousand a peas I will du

hope you will ancer this letter and when you

nobody will see the letter. Hoping to her from

It is evident from this that if Teemer does win

There are many men in this colony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, throuch early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege-
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopelegi invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your ease can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this Invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Enioying Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervou* and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system- regenerating ail the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil bis most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, and require no
restraint or hindrance from business. Pamphlets
enclosed in each case with testimonials.

AYER’S PILLS.
O'
A large proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange*
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes:
“Ayer’s PiLls are invaluable tome, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head fx-om pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physio
I have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and 1 always do so
when occasion offers.
W. L. Page, of W. L. Page & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize' them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine.
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.’*
Mexia, Texas, June 17,1582.
The Rev, Francis B. Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago I
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.’’
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living in a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of Rfe-

of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-

features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties in
all female complaints, and is of superior shape and
manufacture. Price, IDs. and 15s.

GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. Tile Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus-
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad-
dition to tills, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without any shock
immediately upon the nervesand tissues
of the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes this current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes every part, arresting
decay, building up and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of the'enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle is strong,
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,,
impervious to
moisture, and free
from that un-
pleasant musty
odour exu-
ding from
wet bone
handles.

ASSOC I A T/OiV
Now offer to the Aus-
tralian public their new
Electric Hair, Beard &
Moustache Curler, it
is a handsome article, nickel-
plated, with an ebonizcd handle, ai|d it
should occupy a place in the toilet of
every lady and gentleman in Australia.
By its aid, the hair, beard, or moustache
can be curled in any desired style in from
one to two minutes. For ladies, it produces
the “ Langtry Style,” the “ Patti Bang,” the
“Montague Curl,” and any other styles
desired by ladies wearing their hair in the
fashionable “loose and fluffy” mode.
Those who wear waves or other forms
of artificial hair will find this Electric
Curler a very useful article. It does
not break off and ruin the hair,
like the ordinary crimping pro-
cess, and in wet or hot weather
it works as quickly as in cold.
For curling the Moustache
or Beard in a moment, it
has no equal, while it is
so simple in its opera-
tion that any one of
either sex cam use it
successfully the first
time.

LAND OF THE CROCODILE.
(BY MAROOGALINE)
Well known in North Queensland is Edwin
Norris, the solicitor of Townsville. He is one o
the soundest lawyers in Queensland. He is also
an atdent student of astronomy; and possesses,
probably, the finest private telescope in Aus-
tralia. In religion he leans lovingly towards
Pantheism and has an opinion of creeds and
dogmas not to be expressed in all the languages of
Elihu Burritt. One day he was waited on by
Police Magistrate Morey and Walter Hayes. It
had been decided that Townsville should become
a cathedral town, and so the orthodox and Bishop
Staunton were out on the warpath for cash to
erect a gorgeous sacred gunyah to cost £20,000.
Morey and Hayes called for a sub. of £lOO from
Norris. It may be mentioned that the legal as-
tronomer la slightly deaf. On this particular
occasion his hearing was more than usually defec-
tive. "We intend to erect a cathedral,” said
Moray. Norris heard this. “Ah I very good, you
have my full permission to erect half a dczenl
"And, of course, a leading citizen like you will
give £lOO towards it,” said Morey, Norris didn't
hear that. “You will give ns a hundred, won’t
you ?” said Morey in a voice that was heard over
on Magnetic Island. The smile that irradiated the
features of Norris was like the flash ol sheet
lightning in the bosom of the midnight cloud.
"Gentlemen! astronomy is my religion, a noble, a
godlike religion, the study of the Universe and
the manifestation of the Eternal—a study wide
and deep as eternity! How, then, can you come
to me for money to build your miserable religious
structures and assist in propagating one of the
gigantic ecclesiastical impostures that alliiot
humanity ? But 1 will be magnanimous with you I
Give me £lOO pounds towards another and larger
telescope and I will give you £5O towards your
cathedral!” Then Morey and Hayes crawled out
and went round to the Queen’s in solemn silence
and buried their pale noses in a couple of tumblers.

Oa veritable spider threads does the
judgment sword hang suspended over this doomed
earth. We walk through life on Al-3irat bridges
of single hairs hung trembling above unfathom-
able abysses. Even Love himself, highest gift of the
gods, holds an equally uncertain tenure. lam in
possession of a painful illustration of this. I have
the tale from the youth himself. He was engaged
to the daughter of a clergyman. They loved each
with all the passionate ardour exhibited generally
by young hearts in the first fervour of Love’s young
dream. She was good and pious. He himself can-
didly admitted to me that he was neither one nor
the other. At times, even In her presence, a word
of somewhat irridescent hue would escape in an
absent moment, and sunder the two souls for a
few days or weeks. One afternoon they were
seated on a fallen tree close to the river in the
usual position. His left arm included three seg-
ments of a circle and her little velv<tty left paw
was soothingly clasped in his right. He was a
somewhat romantic youth, and quoted poetry
copiously. The only other spectator of the scene
was a robust red soldier ant in grand form, rambling
round on an exploring trip at the junction of the
young man with the log. “My darling,” he said,
“ The cold in clime are cold in blood.
Their love it scarce deserves the name,
But mine is like the iava flood
That boils in Etna’s ’ —Woo-ooh!
“ Oh Sheol and blazes!” This, you perceive, is the
exact time at which the red soldier ant took an ac-
tive pirt in the programme. And in the spasmodic
recoil from the poisoned weapon of the treacher-
ous foe, the young man went baokwards over the
log, accompanied by the clergyman’s daughter
aud a pair of small Balmorals and a pair of num-
ber eights were pointed simultaneously at the
zenith. They have never spoken since. Their
pathways now are due North and due South. The
exclamation, coupled with the subsequent indig-
nity, dashed apart for ever—
" Two hearts the world in vain had tried,
And sorrow but more closely tied,
That stood the storm when waves were rough,
Yet in a sunny hour fall off ” a log.
* * *
He was a young man, “highly connected,”
and bo came to Queensland to start sugar-grow-
ing. He had the usual “ Imported ” exalted notion
of himself, and was, doubtless, surprised to find
that his landing on our shores was not the cause
of an earthquake and an eclipse of the sun. He
Selected on one of the Northern rivers, and started
out one day to fix a site for a house, with the
intention of living there. He was rather nervous
ejneerning myalls and crocodiles. On the way out
ue had dinner at the camp of an old timber-getter,
the champion liar of tne Anglo-Saxon race. “You
my selection, don't you?” said the selector,
and”the old man replied, “I does.” “I hear
there are crocodiles In the creek, and intend to
build on piles 10ft. high.” “God bless yer, sir,
that won’t save jer! You dunno them ere croco-
diles as I know ’em. I knowed a cove as built a
’ouse on the Daintree, 15ft. off the ground, with
two rooms and a v’randa. He sleptmono room,
and two Chinamen in the other. One night a 30ft.
crocodile came up from the river, put a 20ft.
ladder against the window, and climned up into
the Chicamen’s room, When the settler went into
that room in the mornin’ the crocodile was fast
aslepp with both Chinamen in his innards.”
"Great Heavens! And are there crocodiles of
that species on my selection?” "I reckon there
ain’t no less than 500 in that creek!” “ And have
you ever seen any savages on my selection ?” said
the aristocrat, who was fast filling up about
pioneer life in the North. The old man looked up
at the roof, and gave an expressive whistle.
Poising the leg of a boiled scrub hen on his fork,
he replied as i olio ws: “I ain’t the man, sir, as ud
like to scare any chap off his selection, but I feel
bound to tell yer the truth aforehand. I was
camped once on that creek. There were 10 o’ us,
all with rifles and revolvers, and plenty ammyni-
ahun. The niggers came on us by moonlight and
fought up to dinner time next day. We fired a
thousand rounds and reckoned there weren’t no
less than 300 myalls wiped out. The crocodiles ate
them all and saved us a lot o’ buryin’.” And the
old man coughed and called through the window to
the black boy, "Snowball, put the bridle on old
Antichrist, and run them bullocks up I” And the
aristocrat went back to town and advertised for a
bailiff to go down and fulfil the residence clause
on that selection.

I have to report a case of glaring sacrilege
at Cairns. The Church of England clergyman there
Is a Mr. G. R. E. Nobbs. It is a terrible auto-
graph to be launched out with on the shoreless
universe, but he struggles nobly under the afflic-
tion. One night he invited a few friends to spend
the evening, and had arranged a little surprise in
the shape of an oyster supper. The Chinese
oysterman opened them at the back door, and
stood them on large plates on the kitchen table.
There were 40 dozen. And when Nobbs thought
the time bad come to announce the banquet-to
call the visitors to the "feast of shells”—he said,
“Dear brothers and sisters In Christ,—As God
gave you all an appetite for oysters, I have
ordered4o dozen to appease that appetite; come
with me and enjoy them, and we will return
thanks 1” But lo! and behold! when Nobbs
skipped cheerfully out for the oysters, they were
gonel It appears that three young men, promi-
nent citizens, I grieve to say, being temporarily
possessed by devils, and hearing of the contem-
plated feast, arrived on the scene just as the
Chinaman left, and feloniously and diabolically
annexed the whole 40 dozen. And snameful insult
was added to gross injury by sending 10 dozen to
the Catholic oriest—a “jayml” son of the first
“gimof the say,” who, believing them to come
from some devout sou of the Church, ate them
with great relish, and went to sleep with pleasant
dreams. No painter could have caught the ex-
pression on the face of Nobbs when no found his
oysters had emigrated—
“ln voice and gesture savage nature spoke,
And from his eye the gladiator broke.”
Christianity was not equal to preserve serenity
and award forgiveness for such an outrage. In
the first Impulse of that terrible moment he
breathed a fervent prayer that the miscreants who
stole those oysters should be carted straight off to
Sheol without dying. He reported the sacrilege
to the police, and it is said the unregenerate
Hibernian sergeant sent up a mad shout of
laughter that burst the local welkin. And it
causes me grevlous pain to have to admit that the
smile was universal among the population. Such
la the effect of the Northern climate on the godless
and lawless Queensland democracy. The act was,
of course, indignantly denounced by the truly re-
ligious members of the Church, but those who de-
nounced it the most earnestly of all were the
three men who stole the oysters,
* * ♦
They were two young men acquiring colo-
nial experience, and were trying to persuade a
robust yearling calf to move along a narrow crush
pen into the jam, so as to tatoo his north-west
corner witn the brand. They were knowing
young men, as most amateur bushmen are, and
nobody could teach them anything on any subject.
Bo they slipped a pole across behind the youtnful
bovine, and each one stood behind it and pushed
forward with hia tummy. And wnfie in this atti-
tude another yearling came down the pen sud-
denly, with the rush of a sirocco, and struck the
pole plumb centre with his ample chest I Then the
highly-connected young bushmen started across
the yard in a series of handsprings, fiip-flaps, and
upstarts that would have turned the best circus
acrobat green with envy. As the stockmen gently
lifted them up out of what a Scotchman would
call ‘‘anawfu’ heap o’sham,” the wisest of the
two was heard to feebly utter, “ I always was led
to believe there were no earthquakes in Queens-
land! ”
The Warrnambool Independent, speak-
ing of the opposition of Melbourne papers to the
decentralisation movement which is now making
such a stir in Victoria, makes this mordant re-
mark:—"Melbourne journalists are (naturally,
perhaps) jealous of the project to call into life and
being a National party, which means, amongst
other things, spoliation to the city to the extent
of its disproportionate representative power, and
they sneer at it accordingly.” Who will dare to
say that brain-power and biting wit are not
evolved from potatoes after that ?
Next to being a high church parson, with
a committee of unmarried ladies to manage our
coal and blanket department, and report progress
—one at a time—in the vestry, we would elect to
be secretary of a Working Men’s Benefit Society.
The largest of these societies in England, the
“Royal Liver” (no reference to the Queen’s in-
ternal arrangements), has been brought under the
miscrosoope lately. Its benefits are apparent to
the dullest of working men. The two secretaries
draw £5OO a year each, and mix committeemen are
remunerated at the rate of £ll per week. All the
working men get is a weekly call for their little
subscriptions. The correct ticket, nowadays, is to
work working men, then you benefit. We re-
member seeing a gaunt army of poor devils trudg-
ging along to Westminster to present some peti-
tion or another. They were Kentish labourers, it
we remember rightly, aud had been walking some
80 or 90 miles. They hadn’t raised a very large
amount of funds for the job on hand, but we re-
member that the secretary of tne movement came
along on a horse, and had enough meat upon his
bones to furnish any 10 of the working men whose
benefit he was toiling tor. And, by the way, did
you ever see a prime mover in any working men s
"strike” without a cigar in his mouth? Only
when he was wolfing his four courses. Even the
bookmakers who organised that strike at Hobart
went about with prime bavannabs between their
teeth.
The real heir to the Tiohhorne estate, Sir
Henry Alfred Doughty Tichborne, will bo of ago
next May. The necessity of defending his pro-
perty against the intrigues of the Wapping and
Wagga butcher entailed upon his trustees the
large expenditure of £130,000 but he will still be a
rich man, for his estates, which are in Hampshire,
Lincolnshire, Dorcestshire, and Buckinghamshire,
represent nearly 12,000 acres, and it is estimated
that, with the London properties, the gross rent-
roll of the young baronet will be £28,000 a year.
The S. A. Minister of Education has been
petitioned to allow Government assistance to
prospect the country for gold, silver, water, and
other minerals. Weil, passing over the debatable
ground afforded by classing water as a mineral,
we will furnish the Minister for Education with a
little information. Water, without which man
cannot live, and consequently cannot p. ospect for
the other minerals, Is to be found at intervals
along the Overland Telegraph line. Gold, silver,
&0., are not to be found nearer than the M'Don-
nel Range, which, being within the Northern Ter-
ritory limit, is more directly under the control of
the Resident than of the Government. The
country for hundreds of miles north of the Peake
is chiefly saltnush, and there are no aurileroUS
i indications. Water, however, is plentiful at in-
tervals. Fourteen miles out is Archebuckan, a
permanent waterhole on Neal's Creek; 15 miles
further are Oaduaowio dpringa; 30 miles west is
Stuart’s waterhole, where the explorer camped
I lor some time on his last trip across; seven miles
further is Hookey s Water; and eight miles more,
the Anglepole-34 miles from this is Ross’s hole, a
j magnificent sheet of water, never having failed.
1 This is near the junction of the Macumba and
Alberga Creeks, and for 111 miles further, at inter-
| vals along the Stephenson, water is in plentiful
} supply; then Dalhousie Springs are reached, and
j 40 miles further the border line Is crossed, and
I the Government Resident then exercises his juris-
I diction in the Northern Territory. We gained the
above information by going through the country.
; but we give it to the S.A. Minister freely.
! It is not as generally known as it deserves
1 to be that the Iveraatile Professor Pearson is the
| writer of the literary reviews which appear from
time to time in the Melbourne age. It would
simply be presumptuous praise on our part to say
that tne Professor is a clever man and a clear and
I acute writar. So we will not| say it. What we
wish to say, however, is that nearly all of his re-
views oi any book whatever—from the Revised
Edition of the Scriptures to tne bizarreries of
Lewis Carroll—seem to be written with the pur-
pose of letting a cold world know how much
better than the authors themselves the critic could
have done the work if he only chose to spare the
time and take the trouble. In the issue of the
Ace of last Saturday there is a review irom hia
pen on a volume ot essays and sketches by
Thackeray, entitled “ New Workby an Old Hand.”
As these smaller performances of the great novel-
ist are but little known to the present generation
—having lain in the shroudy sheets of old maga-
zines for many years—lt might naturally be ex-
pected that tne critic would coniine himself to
them as much as possible. But mat would not
suit Professor Pearson. It was neoesiary, in his
opinion, that the reading publicsnouiaknow what
he thinks of Thackeray all round, and, accord-
ingly, alter briefly stating that “the present
volume, consisting chiefly of essays on art, essays
on books, and essays on gastronomy, though two
or three stories have been admitted, seems to
show that the great satirist was on the whole well
counselled in taking the direction he struck iotoin
his maturer days,” he leaves the book alone and
launcaes forth into a general review of all the other
and well-known woiks of the author—a quite
gratuitous proceeding, as whatever required to
be said on this subject was said long ago. Pro-
fessor Pearson does not, on the whole, though
giving him credit for fineness of style, think much
of Thackeray. For instance, he begins his re-
marks by saying-“He (ThacKoray) constructed
his plots badly, and ‘ rung tne changes ’ in all his
stories on three or four stock characters.” Again,
this austere critic observes ot poor Thackeray
that “he is for ever like the German who jumped
our chairs and tables that he may (sic) learn to be
lively.” These be hard words, but there are
worse at the conclusion of the article. What do
you think ot tnis—readers of Vanity Fair, the
Newcombs, and Pendennts ?—“ surely we must
judge a man by the sum total of the impression he
creates, and say that he was a bad artist if he
massed glaring colours where he meant to exhibit
m-jntal tints. The fact seems to he that the very
intensity which made Thackeray strong, made
him also monotonous and one-sided.” There now!
That's the way to write. But If Thackeray were
living, we should like to see what he would have
to say about Professor Pearson. He would pro-
bably say nothing at all. We nope, however, that
this learned and incisive critic will some day give
us a work of his own that will completely justify
hia contempt of the works of other men,
THE LAY OF THE LAST LOAFER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I gently breathe the “ Bonny Hills,”
" The Lass o’ Gowrle ’’ introduce,
The wily Scot my pewter fills—
I’ve cut the tight-drawn purse strings loose.
The sons of France I can beguile
With martial strains of bygone days,
I bitterly Bismarck revile
And then strike up the "Marseillaise.”
I swear my Irish feelings gush
For France and her bright lilies fair,
Nor doth my cheek betray a blush,
Save what the brandy’s painted there.
00 long I’ve been the willing tool
Of each selector and small farmer
1 now play tunes instead of fool—
Oh, list to Shaugheraun the Charmer;
And with my merry hit of stick
I blow (not Tony Trollope’s blowing),
But strains that all creation lick
From out my trusty flute are flowing.
A Cosmopolitan am I
Of melody for every race,
And patriot airs I can supply—
A tune for every time and place.
When Erin’s exiled sons I meet
I know the strain to catch their ear—
’Tis poor Burke’s dream, played low and sweet,
The Harp that onco to Tara dear.
If these tunes fail to pave the way
Unto the nearest public bar,
Whose lamp casts forth its cheery ray,
The sodden loafer's guiding star,
“ The Wearing of the Green " I'll try
And follow up with “Molly Bawn,”
And then “ No Irish Need Anply ”
If they don’t boose the Shamrheraiin.
To honest John Bull, staunch and true,
I’ll give the dose that he most craves—
“ God t-ave the Queen,” “ Red, White, and Blue,”
And “Britons Never Shall be Slaves;”
But, oh, the triumph of my art
Is canny Saunders to bewitch,
And pierce his adamantine heart,
And screw him up to shouting pitch,
I sail as well on t’other tack,
With Germans 1 am hand in hand.
The Standard-Bearer bears them hack
Across the Rhine to Yatherlaud.
They say, “ Old man, you drinks mit me,
I shouts to yet your offside eye.
Off lager beer we hash some spree
And makes dose swallows downward fly,”
I grasp this honest Stofel’s hand,
Eureka, boys, I have “ Struck Oil,”
Australia is our Yatherland
Where none but brainless serfs need toil.

The Shepherd’s Dieam.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The star of the evening shines bright in the sky,
The gloaming betokens day’s ending is nigh,
And sentinels spring to their posts one by one,
The night watches taking at set of the sun;
Lights flicker in halls of the mansions aoove,
Where dwell with toe angels the lost ones we love
And meteors flash forth their pale sudden light, ’
A welcome to Luna, fair queen of the night;
The scent-laden zephyrs breathe soft 'mid the
trees,
Through the golden-plumed wattles which per.
fume the breeze,
Avid on through the evening they lazily whirl
To the hut whence the smoky wreaths gracefully
curl:
To where, in the doorway, the old shepherd lies,
His thoughts far away neath perhaps brighter
skies.
His pipe droops, and falls from his now careless
lips.
The collie licks fondly his dry finger tips.
He dreams. Draw the veil; he is young once
again,
The tuture before him, fit end to life’s plain,
Gives promise of noble name honestly won,
Ere sets in eternity life’s feeble sun.
He dreams. He has left all the scenes of his hope
And rushed with the crowd with coy Fortune to’
cope,
To shores of the newly-knowu South he has sped,
Ambition and hope, love of fame is now dead,
For gold, dull ana yellow, uncoined, he delves,
In this sou ih land where freemen erst governed
themselves:
Red-sashed and blue-shirted, long-booted they
roam.
Each man for himself and some dear one at homo:
He toils with the rest at the sluice-box or tub,
Works his way round the diggings to rest at the
hub,
He (lashes his chamois and drinks with the ruck,
In the city ’mid good fellows “ treating ” their
luck,
And laughs, as the Roederer volleys around,
“ Drink up, boys, drink hearty, there’s more
underground."
He dreams. He is now on the Eureka Flat,
And faces and names are to memory pat:
The single-armed traitor who crawled in the
night
To tne camp of the soldiers he has him In sight,
And one “ forty-niner ” had gone to show cause
At that tribune where juries ne’er toy with the
laws:
But muskets are faithless, he misses his mark,
The miners’ betrayer escapes in tne dark.
He stands with the few, panic-stricken, dismayed,
And fights as the red coats rush through the
stockade;
The miners, defeated, are scattered and fled.
And Liberty, writhing, mourns Freedom as dead.
It is night; he is down at the “ Cnarley Napier,’’
Mid women and music, and diggers, and beer.
Where Lola flogged one of the White Flat police
The night Mick M'Carthy shot Ante-up Reece.
The scene changes slowly, at home once again,
He murmurs fond words by the stile in the lane.
They sit in the twilight, she whispers her vow,
3he was true enough then—that was then, this is
now.
In his dream he Is reading his letter from home;
That long-looked-for letter at last has it come.
He reads of her marriage; his heart turns to lead,
And memory mourns for the love that is dead.
With a curse on her falsehood he dashes to earth
The letter, and plunges ’mid folly and mirth;
In the bowl drowns his thoughts of the love that
is gone.
Of hopes which are blighted and days that are
done
(For drink can drown sorrow, and hope ’twill re-
new;
Fair woman is faithless, dark brandy is true).
Now swiftly before him Old Time spins the glass,
In review the events of his later life pass,
The days of the “ fifties,” the good times have
flown,
He has drifted and fallen, a vagabond grown,
Facilis decensus, he sinks fast from the height.
And sleeps here the ragged old shepherd to-night.
The stars in the azure are fading away.
The call of the jaybird announces the day.
The sunbeams are tinting the far western hill—
’Tis daylight, the shepherd is slumbering still;
The sheep are yet yarded, the hurdles are drawn,
The collie uneasily barks in the dawn,
His brown eyes turn wistfully oft to the door,
To the master who ne’er slept as soundlv before;
He hounds to his side, licks bis face and his hand.
Then gazes with eyes wnich can scarce under-
stand.
He bar as, but his master lifts never bis head,
The collie whines sadly—the shepherd is dead I

The Sands of Time, and the Directory of
John Sands, are about equally familiar, or more
so, to Sydney people. We have just seen the last
issue of the Directory. It is about as large as a
Family Bible, and contains nearly as much infor-
mation, ana of a considerably more reliable sort.
Some new and valuable suburban maps have been
added to this issue, and these have been copy-
righted, probably from fear lest the Nooze should
use them for leaders. Forty thousand more names
appear in this edition than in the last, and the
book itself is lovely enough outside to occupy a
place beside the morocco album on the ormolu
table of a Pott’s Point peer, or a Bur wood
baronet.
After all, we cannot approach within
coo-ey of the Burmese in devising Ingenious tor-
tures for our criminals. In Burmah they crucify
robbers by stretching them upon strong bamboo
crosses, like grape-vine trellises, and breaking
their legs. Occasionally the wretches are smeared
with honey, and they are then eaten by the ants.
An observant gentleman who was passing- un the
Irrawaddy in a steamer the other day saw 13 of
these crucified robbers occupying crosses on the
banks of the river. “ The nearest was a handsome
man, with floe features. He just raised his head
as the steamer came in view—tne last he was ever
to see. I shall hardly ever forget the dying look
of piteous appeal from the handsome old man as
the steamer paddled past his cross. The chief
engineer photographed it.’’
A CELEBRATED SURORON'S EXPERIENCE.
Sandgate, Brisbane, August 9,1885,
Gentlemen,- My wife had a severe attack of
Rheumatism, which flitted from joint to joint, for
more than a week, when a friend (in my absence
from home) recommended St. Jacob’s Oil, and
after two or three applications according to the
instructions given, she found herself, much to her
surprise and delight, entirely free from pain, and
now always keeps a bottle of the Oil in the house.
I am, sir.
Yours faithfully,
H. T. GIRDLHSTONE.
M.R.O.S., Eng'., L.A.C., Bond.
