BOOKS
Communist Propaganda
A member of the council of the Sane
Democracy League remarked to the “S.
M. Herald” on his return, from London
the other day: “The Bolsheviks are con-
centrating their efforts in the Pacific, with
special attention to China, Japan and
Australia.” He might have added, “And
Hitlerism, in a way, is helping them.”
Such publications as The Brown Book
the Hitler Terror (Gollancz; 55.) ar
frankly designed to revolt lovers of jus
tice, and an inevitable side-effect is t
make many think more kindly of Com
munism. Professor Einstein, the editor
is, in the words of a London “Dail
Mail” leader-writer, “a prominent paci
fist connected with Communist societies,
and Lord Marley, writer of the foreword
was refused admission to Japan a few
months ago as a Bolshevik propagandist
But whatever the political views o;
Hitler’s enemies may be, they have cer
tainly put up a strong case against him
and against Fascism in general. In Lore
Marley’s words:
Public opinion is unfortunately only’too ready
to reconcile itself to a fait accompli, as in th
case of Italy. This book aims at keeping aliv
the memory of the criminal acts of the Naz
Government.
Jt deals at length with the Reichstag
fire (a fake, so it is alleged, designed to
bring odium on the German Communis
party); gives details of Hitler’s “Cam-
paign against Culture,” and describes
with elucidatory photographs, how the
Jews of Germany are being persecuted
Very few books in favor of Fascism
reached Australia when that system was
being established in Italy, and none are
arriving now which attempt to justify
Hitlerism ; though—if only on the prin-
ciple that there are two sides to every
case —there is presumably something to
be said for it. Instead, we are getting a
stream of publications similar to those
which are noticed below.
The U.S.S.R.’s First Saint
Lenin, by Ralph Fox (Gollancz ; 55.),
is a rapturous appreciation of the
founder of Sovietism by a former
member of the Russian Communist
party who has had access to the
30 volumes of Lenin’s writings, the 20
volumes of the Lenin miscellany and
innumerable official documents. He
begins with Vladimir Ulyanov’s birth at
Simbirsk in 1870. Sasha, his brother,
having been involved in the attempt to
assassinate Alexander 111. in 1887, was
hanged. Three months later Vladimir
entered Kazan University under F. Ker-
ensky (“father of the pitiful political
charlatan whom Lenin was to drive in
panic flight from the Winter Pqlace in
November, 1917”), and inside four
months he was expelled. At Kazan the
young student met a baker of his own
age named Pyeskov.
These two were to meet again years later and
become lifelong friends. The baker was then
known as Maxim Gorky (“Maxim the Bitter”),
and Vladmir Ulyanov had become Nikolai
Lenin.
So began the unrelenting hatred of
the bourgeois Lenin for his class, and for
the Czardom. His career is traced with
a wealth of references to his burial in
January, 1924, in the Mausoleum under
the Kremlin wall, when “for the first
time in history a man at his death was
mourned in every country of the world.”
The quoted sentence is an example of
the over-statements which render this
work historically valueless. Many popes,
and notably Pio Nono, were mourned in
countries that know little of Lenin to
this day. General Booth’s death caused
far more grief throughout the world than
Lenin’s did.
Politics Only
Soviet Education, by R. D. Charques
(Hogarth Press; Is. 6d.), admits that
Russia has made no original contribution
to the crucial problem of how to teach.
Yet “Soviet education must be reckoned
a new force in the world”: the U.S.S.R.
Government has succeeded in political-
ising education.
Its main object is
to produce effi-
cient Communist
propagandists, an
odd result being
that those who
put the case for Sovietism in speech or
writing are often ignorant of the ele-
ments of grammar. All culture is subor-
dinated to a single end. “Art is not art
in Soviet Russia at the moment unless
it is politics.” So a great Russian pic-
ture resembles a mid-Victorian genre
painting. Bribein’s “The First Lesson” re-
presents an elderly peasant woman being
taught to write the letter “a” by a mem-
ber of the Young Communist League
Similarly every Russian play or movie
must tell a political story.
The future of education in Soviet Russia de
pends very largely on, the younger generation
on the members of the Young Communis
League, on the Pioneers —the phoenix that rose
from the ashes of the Boy Scout movement in
Russia —on the little Octobrists.
Australians know something about the
results of this system. Young people
are being taught in our Red Sunday
Schools that nothing matters, culturally,
but the inculcation of Marxism. It is
responsible for the dissemination of a
vast amount of misinformation. At the
recent Paddington Town Hall Anti-war
meeting “a lad, wearing short trousers,
told his audience that Japan was prepar-
ing to attack defenceless Russia from the
air.” By a coincidence the official air
figures of the Powers were given in a
London cable a few days later. Japan
has 88 civil and 1939 fighting ’planes;
Russia has “between 8000 and 10,000
machines ready for action, while Soviet
factories are turning out the latest type
of military aeroplane at the rate of 1200
a year.”
An effect of the U.S.S.R. educational
system is to evolve a generation of loose-
thinking, intolerant young prigs, and
that, of course, is happening in Aus-
tralia to an extent.
Marxism Made Easy
“At no time in the past,” says the blurb
of Professor Hook’s Karl Marx (Gol-
lancz; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.) “has Marx’s
philosophy been so potent a force as it
is to-day.” The obstacle to an under-
standing of it has been the abysmal dul-
ness and prolixity of such works as
“Capital.” Professor Hook, who is
gifted with a mind and style of excep-
tional clarity, has devoted himself to
stating the Marxian evangel in the
fewest words and the plainest language.
The Theory of the State goes into a
chapter of less than 20 pages, and the
Class Struggle is covered in 16 pages.
Among the many masterpieces of com-
pression is a recital ~ of the conditions
necessary for the production of a revolu-
tionary situation involving all classes ; it
occupies about three-quarters of a page!
Marx took many thousands of words
to say this:
The proletarian dictatorship, like all dictator-
ships, is based on force. But it is not lawless
or irresponsible. Its acts are strictly determined
by the dictates of revolutionary necessity. It
justifies what it does by principles which, in the
course of time, it proceeds to codifv —as all
other States do.
An advantage which Sovietism enjoys
over every other theory of government
is its knack of attracting the support of
writers like Professor Hook. Conser-
vatism has been “the stupid party” in
the estimation of bright young people
in every age; hundreds in England,
America and elsewhere are now devot-
ing themselves to showing that it is also
the blackguardly party. It is a pity that
no author of any consequence should
have a word to say for the defence.

GLASS FRUIT FLY TRAPS
CATCH THE FLY BEFORE HE DOES THE DAMAGE
Recommended by Department of Agriculture.
Fruit-growers, protect your crops from the destructive fruit fly! These glass fly traps are officially recommended
as the best method of fly destruction by the Department of Agriculture. They are baited with about 6 fl. oz. of a
lure attractive to the flies, and suspended in the trees by a wire tied around the neck of the trap. To be most
effective, they should be placed about 6 feet from the ground and be sheltered by the foliage.
Traps. to be effective should be placed regularly at least one to every eight or ten trees. As the bait deteriorates,
it should be renewed every six days or less. <J Use “Watsonia” Fruit Fly Destroyer. Costs less than -Jd. per tree.

cost per shave not the cost per

Gillette Slotted Blades are dual-

the steel at the edges means keen-

much better shaves and more shaves

GILLETTE INDUSTRIES LIMITED, 197-207, CITY ROAD, LONDON, E.C.I
the London Missionary Society and other
sources enhance the interest.
The history of the South Seas begins,
so far as the white races are concerned,
with Tasman’s voyage from Batavia in
the middle of the seventeenth century.
His discoveries were not appreciated by
the Councillors of Batavia, who dis-
patched him on his dangerous enterprise
with cordial wishes for “the blessing of
the Ruler of all things” and prayers for
his safe return.
The grand object in fitting out this expedi-
tion was not the extension ol Christianity, as it
had been with the Spaniards of earlier days;
nor was it the advancement of Science, as with
Cook and Banks in the century that followed.
It was not even the enhancement of the reputa-
tion of Holland (though that touched the
Council more nearly): it was essentially the dis-
covery of unknown lands in the South Pacific,
with a view to the promotion of trade and the
immediate acquisition of wealth in the form of
gold, silver and pearls.
Nearly a third of the book is devoted
to Tasman’s voyages; his Journal is
freely quoted from ; and his many seem-
ingly contradictory statements are ana-
lysed by reference to charts and other
sources of information. As showing the
thoroughness of this unusual historian’s
methods he pursued one set of facts in
the Prins Wyllem’s Islands (which he
visited on H.M.G.S. Pioneer), in Austra-
lia, in London (at the British Museum,
Admiralty Library and elsewhere), in
Amsterdam and The Hague, in Leiden
and in Paris, where he ran his quarry to
ground.
Cook, whose section has as a frontis-
piece a reproduction of the portrait by
Dance in the Greenwich Hospital, only
gets 14 pages. He is of interest chiefly,
for the purposes of this volume, as the
first white man to make contact with
Fijians.
The immortal Bligh, indisputably one
of the greatest seamen of all time, is
allotted 70 pages ; and the chapter deal-
ing with his achievements is prefaced by
a reproduction of the sketch which
Dance did of his stern profile and
asymmetrical head in 1794, and which is
now in the National Portrait Gallery.
The narrative is mostly told in the form
of extracts from “the log of the proceed-
ings of His Majesty’s ship Bounty” in
the Mitchell Library. Incidentally. Pro-
fessor Henderson advances the opinion
that the M.S. in the Library is a copy of
the original. Three charts are repro-
duced and a double page from the log
of the launch of the Bounty.
The charges of misbehavior and cow-
ardice which were levelled against Bligh
in 1808 are dismissed in this book as
“worthy of little serious consideration.”
Bligh had many enemies in Sydney.
A large number of them were venom-mouthed
curs whom nobody had power to muzzle; low-
class fortune-hunters whose chief object was to
defraud the Government by smuggling in liquor
and exploit the vices of the community for
their own material aggrandisement.
Students of human nature, as distinct
from students of history, remain sceptical
of the charges against Bligh for the rea-
son that, in their experience, two things
stand to a man of his type in all cir-
cumstances —discipline and courage. It
was his nature to fight. In Professor
Henderson’s words: “Every one of his
distinctions came, not by favor or social
influence, but by devotion to duty and
conspicuous acts of bravery.”
H. S.
Art and the Public
“A public gallery,” says “H.S.” (B.
4/10/’33), “is not primarily an educa-
tional institution.” It is; it can’t help
being one. Even a bad gallery educates.
It may educate along the wrong lines, but
no person who looks at a picture remains
uninfluenced by it. It is from paintings
that the non-painter gets his ideas of the
visual world about him. He is so com-
pletely conditioned by them, and by art
generally, that a Frenchman who reads
“La Vie Parisienne” sees mankind in
terms of the particular deformations of
the Parisian caricaturists; an English-
man sees it in terms of Low and the
“Punch” artists; an Australian, in terms
of Norman Lindsay, Scorfield and Frith.
In the larger realm of tone, form and
color, the non-painter sees gum-trees like
Heysen’s and sunsets like Streeton’s.
Present him with an entirely new impres-
sion of the same objects by, say, Max
Meldrum, and he will say it is not like
Nature, meaning really that it is not like
Heysen or Streeton. When the modern-
ists get into their stride, as, I think, they
are bound to do, non-painters will com-
mence seeing gum-trees in terms of Van
Gogh, seas in terms of Gauguin and
humanity in terms of Matisse and
Cezanne. Nudes with dolichocephalous
heads and legs suggesting an advanced
stage of elephantiasis will be accepted as
the academic stereotypes of Charles
Wheeler and Bernard Hall are now.
The fundamental difference between
the. painter and the non-painter is this:
the painter, as painter, needs to know
the visual world as pure sensation, not
as men, trees, houses, hills and motor-
cars. The sensations come to him as
patches of color, of varying shapes and
sizes and tonal qualities, and his job is
to define the relationships between them.
The non-painter, though he may know
the world to a greater or less degree as
sensation, is primarily concerned with
perceptions he gets through other organs
than his optics. That is to say, he knows
that an object is hard, soft, round or
square because he has previously felt
similar objects ; he knows a girl is plump,
pretty and would make a helpmate he
can be proud of, because the movies, the
newspapers and perhaps even the art
galleries have instilled in him certain
ideals of beauty and physical perfection.
He knows some things are nice to eat
and others are nasty, because he has
tasted similar objects or been told about
them. He has to know things in this
way or he wouldn’t survive in the cease-
less struggle for existence. He would
burn his fingers, eat poison, marry a
woman whose hats would give him a
poor return in popular admiration, or be
run over by a tramcar. The painter, as
a human being, is obliged to know them
in that way, too. But, in order to define
what he actually receives in sensation
alone, the painter has to forget the know-
ledge he has acquired through percep-
tion, and this is a task for which a life-
time is not long enough. To the degree
that he succeeds he will have discovered
new worlds of beauty, for the benefit of
the people as well as for his own benefit.
A national gallery, like a national Par-
liament, may elect to give the people
what it thinks the people will like, or
it may elect to show them something
better. Politicians who flatter popular
prejudices are usually successful, but I
don’t think “H.S.” would regard them
as benefactors of the nation. Art direc-
tors who do the same are also usually
highly honored, but the nation is cheated
by their existence. “H.S.” has his pre-
ferences, anyhow. He doesn’t like the
moderns and thinks that the gallery
which flatters them “may be doing the
public a grievous wrong.” I am entirely
in agreement with him, but that isn’t to
say that there are no better standards
than those affected by the governors of
Australian national art institutions.
M. G. SKIPPER.
Gordon’s Centenary
On Oct. 19, 1833, in the Azores a boy
was born who was to influence Austra-
lian literature more than any preceding
writer. Scarcely a verse-maker of the
late ’eighties and early ’nineties but came
under the influence of Adam Lindsay
Gordon. His vogue was greater after
his death than before, when Kendall and
Marcus Clarke outshone him.
I was born in the year Kendall’s first
book of verse was published by J. R.
Clarke (a little bewhiskered bookseller
who had a shop on the western side of
George-street, Sydney, where now the
Queen Victoria Market stands); and,
though I was only eight when Gordon
blew out his brains on Brighton Beach,
1 can still vividly recall my Parramatta-
born father reading out an account of
the suicide. Maybe the fact that I was
born near historic Windsor, on the
Hawkesbury, where Charles Harpur, the
father of Australian versifiers, also was
born, helped to turn my mind early in the
direction of purely Australian verse. One
thing, anyhow, 1 know: Kendall was
still living when I bought my first
edition of Gordon’s works, which con-
tained, wrongly, Mowbray Morris’s “A
Voice from the Bush” ; it was from The
Bulletin that I learned that “The Voice”
was not the voice of Gordon.
Half a century ago—on May 5, 1885—
The Bulletin accepted my first verses.
They were more or less inspired by
Gordon, and now, in turn, I want to do
something for my idol of other days.
Hitherto, Victoria has staged the only
celebrations in his honor. At my sugges-
tion, the Unitarian Church, Sydney, set
aside Emerson Hall last (Tuesday)
night for a ceremony in honor of the
man who wrote “The Sick Stockrider,”
with the president of the N.S.W. Henry
Lawson Literary Society as chief
speaker; and this afternoon (Oct. 18),
in Siddeley Chambers, Hunter-street, I
am to address a class of young Austra-
lians on the philosophy of the man who
wrote “Gone” —his tribute to Burke and
Wills.
On Thursday it will be a hundred years
since Adam Lindsay Gordon was born,
and it is more than 63 years since he fol-
lowed the explorers.

Cobblers and Lasts
“M.G.S.” (R.P. 4/10/’33), like Arch-
bishop Duhig, in whose defence he has
risen, makes the error of not keeping
within his own sphere. As a chronicler,
after the Wodehouse fashion, of the
divers means by which a tired business
man may obtain mental relaxation, he
shows to better advantage than as a
logician.
He makes but one point. “The
Church,” he says, “takes men’s minds
away from the troubles of this life by
inviting them to contemplate a life of
spiritual perfection beyond the grave,’
a way of escape from reality which he
regards as preferable to that offered by
the reading of novels.
Of course it is preferable (provided
always one possesses the necessary
faith), but it does not disprove my asser-
tion that should a novel succeed in tak-
ing even one person’s mind away from
the worries of life for a few hours the
world would have been definitely poorer
for its non-existence. Nor does it justify
Archbishop Duhig’s preposterous asser-
tion that “90 per cent, of the novels to-
day could be burned and the world left
none the poorer.”
Let our cobblers stick to their lasts.
Clerics who criticise novels they haven’t
read leave themselves as open to con-
demnation as novelists who criticise
church doctrines of which they know
little or nothing.
R. G. RIENITS.
A Satchel of Books
Lord Edgeware Dies, by Agatha
Christie (Crime Club ; 7s. 6d.). Hercule
Poirot makes his appearance again in
this one, with his dull but faithful friend
Hastings as narrator. There are three in-
genious murders and a surprise ending.
Another attraction —one that is' to be
found in all Agatha Christie’s novels —
is the West End atmosphere. She knows
London in all its moods.
Phari, by M. G. Buckingham (Country
Life; 7s. 6d.), is the life-story of a
Tibetan pony. Phari was the progeny
of a Bhutia mare and he had a strain of
Arab. An Englishman bought him for
his little daughter, and he passed, later,
to a soldier who made a crack polo pony
of him. He was badly wounded on
active service, and finished his career as
a pensioner and children’s hack. A
delightful book which will appeal to
animal-lovers old and young, and the
drawings by K. F. Barker are worthy of
the writing.
Scratch Cocky, by L. A. Redgrave
(Pepperday and Co.; 2s. 6d.), is dedicated
to all children who love birds. It is on
the lines of “Feathered Favorites,” which
many Sydney children were introduced
to last year; a well-known local parrot
is depicted in color on each left-hand
page, with name, description and a few
notes about its habits ; on the opposite
page are simple verses, most of which
enjoin kindness to the bird in question,
and, generally, to all birds. Interesting
to children, and useful for reference pur-
poses to many a grown-up.
The Time of Her Life, by Maude
Robinson (Allen and Unwin; 55.), is the
first, and perhaps the most charming, of
the dozen stories about Quakers which
make up this volume. It tells how Wil-
liam Penn —on a visit to England from
the American colony—delights a little
girl of the same age as one'of his own
children by giving her her first holiday
in the country. The themes are all
simple: the fascination of the tales lies
in their revelations of character and in
the out-of-the-way knowledge which the
writer displays of the periods she handles.
Most of the episodes are based on family
traditions or records.
Death Whispers, by Joseph B. Carr
(Cassell ; Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.i,
is a Hollywood thriller. The mysterious
old Myncheon home, Lichen Hall ; Miss
Crump, the trained nurse who arrives at
the terrifying place in a storm ; the pallid
butler who unchains the heavy oaken
front door; Miss Ankarett Myncheon
(“an old woman swathed in such cloth-
ing as Miss Crump had never before seen
in her life”); the murder ; the guests ;
the strange and appalling accidents and
happenings—millions have shuddered at
them all in movie-palaces from the
Pacific Coast to the Gold Coast. An
alcoholic Englishman, referred to as the
Hon. Dick, supplies a good many of the
laughs.
Mystery Men-o’-War, by C. J. Garner
(Nelsonian Library ; 3s. 6d.), takes the
reader back to the days when every Ger-
man was a Hun and every British sea-
man was a hero. Jerry, Peter and Harry
are bo'ys aboard the Patagonia, a food-
carrier in a convoy of 20 ships in the
dark days when England faced starva-
tion. This book describes their adven-
tures with U-boats. It’s just the stuff to
give the Scouts, and many an Imperial-
istic grown-up will be thrilled by the
ingenious and dauntless conduct of Eng-
land’s gallant tars, young and old, when
confronted by Boche frightfulness.

A HOUSE IS BUILDING.
The reform of the N. S. Wales Leg.
Council, begun four years ago in the
roundabout Bavinshaw fashion, has
arrived at the stage where the parties,
real and alleged, are at work on “panels,”
as the daily newspapers call them, and
private persons who want seats and can’t
achieve the dignity of “panels” are just
rolling logs.
The allied Ministerial parties have
one panel ; the country section of the
U.A.P. has another; the Lang crowd
has a third, and the great Federal
Labor party has produced two. Mr. Ted
Grayndler, general secretary of the
A.W.U., claims to be the Federal Labor
party, and Mr. Joe Coates protests that
he is. And the hereditary principle has
been invoked by an old gentleman ; he
proposes to bequeath his seat to his son.
Mr. Lang still clings to the hope that he
can frustrate the knavish tricks of Stevo-
brux, and he is trying to get the whole
business stopped by legal process ; but,
then, he has been trying to do that for
years.
In the dead years when he stood for
“vigorous” borrowing and payment of
the full interest every quarter-day, Mr
Lang set out to reform the Leg.
Council out of existence. As Treasurer
in the Storey-Dooley Ministry, and as
Premier in 1925-27, he was concerned in
the appointment of two lots of abolition-
ists ; but some of these zealots could
not be found when the matter was put
to the vote under his Premiership—it
was about the time when the editor of
the “Labor Daily” was flicked on the
hair by Fascists armed with “new pick-
handles” an hour or so after copies of
the paper, containing a full account of
the outrage, were on their way to the
country —and he had to start all over
again. He assembled a third crew of aboli-
tionists when he returned to office in
1930, and they, together with the true-
blues of the first and second batches,
were in the majority when another vote
was taken. But the Bavinshaw law pro-
vided that the House could not be swept
away without a ratifying referendum ;
and the State Full Court and the Com-
monwealth High Court held that it was
a valid law. So did the Privy Council
when “the greatest leader Labor ever
had” appealed to that last stronghold
of a decaying imperialism.
Mr. Lang went out; Mr. Stevens came
in ; a referendum was held on the ques-
tion of reducing the number of members
from 120-odd to 60 and electing them
for varying periods at joint sittings of
Assemblymen and Councillors ; and the
people, by a majority of 50,000, told the
Government to go ahead. Now the
greatest leader Labor ever had is trying
to upset the people’s decision, by (he
same old Privy Council route, to the
end that the Chamber may be restored
to the dropsical condition that revolted
him for so many years ; and, with the
aid of the faithful Piddington, he has
even sent a petition to King George—at
the risk of giving a conscientious sover-
eign lockjaw in the effort to read out
“Piddo’s” polysyllables to the rest of
the family.
“S. M. Herald” attaches tremendous
importance to the transformation of the
Upper House. When the royal assent
was given to the measure setting up
machinery for nominations, elections and
the transaction of business, it broke into
transports of joy, describing it as “a happy
augury for future prosperity.” “The
political outlook is full of sunshine." the
leader-writer carolled ; “we can look
back upon the hard road by which we
have travelled, politically and industrially,
and be thankful for the bounty of earth
and sky in a great extremity” ; and much
more to the same effect. The Bulletin
wishes it could share its contemporary’s
enthusiasm. Candidly, it does not ex-
pect much of the House that politicians
are building, and it has nothing
but contempt for the plans now
maturing to shove this or that no-
body in a seat, to put the U.A.P. brand
on a few more Labor rats, to give
non-starters in the war preference over
Diggers who have served N. S. Wales
well, since 1918 as before, and to pay
one or two women the empty compli-
ment of placing their names on a ticket
while providing against their election.
And if it is true, as reported in the
“Herald” (the Government has made no
specific announcement), that the 60 or
more members about to be passed out
are to be requited for what certain of
them are pleased to call their services by
being allowed to keep the gold passes
on which they can travel on the nod in
the Government trains and trams of Aus-
tralia and Maoriland, keep them for as
many years as they sat in the Council,
or were supposed to sit (some of them
never went near the place from one year’s
end to another, and others were there
only too often), it will be a flagrant
departure from the terms on which these
persons accepted their appointments, and
a cold-blooded swindle on the taxpayers.
The “Herald” expects that the Upper
House will now be “a great barrier
against aggression of the kind attempted
during the Lang regime”—“an effective
brake” on “spoliation.” It may be some-
thing of the sort while Lang remains in
the Sydney Parliament, but the “brake”
will be about as effective as a thread
of cotton would be if the Langsters get
control of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment and make full use of the sec-
tion of the Constitution which says
that “when the law of a State is
inconsistent with a law of the Com-
monwealth, the latter shall prevail,
and the former shall, to the extent of
the inconsistency, be invalid.” Anyhow,
this election of members by members
who construct panels and roll logs looks
rather sordid, and it will look worse if
they scatter gold passes among rejects.
The people might be better served by a
second Chamber elected by themselves,
even one based on household suffrage.
When it comes to grabbing power from
the people or inventing new privileges
for their order, these politicians, what-
ever they may call themselves, are very
much alike.
CHARITY.
No type of activity in Australia cries so
loudly for regulation as the collection of
money for charity. In all the States it
has become a scramble. There is no co-
ordination of effort. Anybody who
can invent some form of gambling which
will bring in the shekels is allowed to
drain the field on which humbler and less
spectacular concerns depend for their
existence.
In Queensland Bishop Dixon, chair-
man of the Social Service League, has
advocated the formation of a board under
Government supervision to wipe out
overlapping. In Westralia, there have
been murmurs about what is going on.
In N. S. Wales, the whole business has
become a festering sore. It will yield only
to drastic treatment, and that treatment
is certainly not furnished in the Charit-
able Collections Bill now on the stocks.
The only charity it is proposed to regu-
late is the humble sort. The measure
provides that it shall not be lawful for
any person to make an appeal unless the
charity is registered and the committee
sanctions it. Then it proceeds to exclude
from its ambit persons engaged in col-
lections for the Ambulance Brigade ; also,
any person who promotes or assists in an
appeal made by means of any raffle, “art union”
or lottery conducted in accordance with the
Lotteries and Art Unions Act, 1901-1929....
and as well
any person concerned in any collection
for any hospital mentioned in the schedules to
the Public Hospitals Act, 1929, or in any col-
lection made with the approval of the Hos-
pitals Commission of N. S. Wales.
Furthermore, the Minister is given power
to exempt other charities or kinds of
charity by regulation under this peculiar
sub-clause dealing with registration,
exemption and audit:
The regulations may modify the conditions
in the case of any church or any other
charity in which the circumstances render
their strict application difficult or unduly onerous.
This is legislation by regulation with a
vengeance. The Minister has power to
alter an Act of Parliament virtually at his
discretion! Why have Acts of Parlia-
ment? Mr. Chaffey, the Minister, is the
last man to use dishonestly such a pro-
vision, but Mr. Chaffey will not always
be Minister. There will be others not
so scrupulous.
The exclusion from regulation of the
flimsily supervised lotteries and hospital
collections is not to be tolerated. They
are the main activities which call for
regulation. Sydney newspapers are full
of advertisements of a hospital lottery
in which an unspecified number of
tickets is to be issued, and in which the
chance of winning even the smallest prize
is millions of pounds to one ; in which,
moreover, since the whole thing is based
on what is claimed to be a game ot
skill, the first-stage prizes are awarded
by the committee. The only return which
anybody can warrantably hope for is an
infinitesimal share in a couple of State
lottery tickets. Surely this sort of thing
calls for attention.
And who will say that the gentle-
men with the winning ways who run
charities for their own benefit based on
the State lottery—which is conducted (o
finance hospitals—do not need a little
regulating? Some of them are reputed
to sell as many as ten thousand tickets
a week—judging by the number of big
prizes they claim they must each sell
thousands, unless all the laws of chance
are upset by Providence in their favor.
This is how the finance of the thing
works out:
Hospitals’ Share.
Revenue from 10,000 tickets at ss. 3d. .. £2625
Reserved for prizes .. .. .. .. 1610
Gross income of Lottery Dept., out of
which it maintains ten-storeyed build-
ing and huge staff .. .. .. £lOl5
All that the hospitals get is the surplus
out of this sum. The syndicates’ relative
position is as follows:
Sale of 10,000 tickets in one-seventh
shilling shares .. .. .. .. £3500
Purchase of tickets at ss. 3d 2625
Gross profit .. .. .. .. .. £875
And nothing for hospitals—the sole bene-
ficiary is some “Lucky Adolphus” or
“Lucky Ted.” Yet Mr. Stevens and Mr.
Chaffey think this sort of thing does not
call for control.
There is more to come. Charities regis-
tered under the new bill must keep
books, which are to be audited “at inter-
vals prescribed by the regulations.” The
accounts must include total receipts
and total expenditure of any collection,
and of any bazaar, sale, entertainment or
exhibition held with the approval of the
governing body of the charity. There
is no obligation to keep detailed accounts.
Nor will the subscriber to a charity be
empowered to see its books and find
out how his money is spent. Even the
audit provisions, in view of the authority
given to vary the text of the Act by regu-
lation, are not necessarily mandatory.
Finally, dishonest collectors become privi-
leged persons. The thief who embezzles
private cash becomes liable to a maxi-
mum of ten years in gaol. The dishonest
collector who converts the pennies of the
blind to his own uses cannot suffer more
than five years.
The bill is sheer bluff from end to end,
bluff so colossal that one can scarcely
imagine men like Mr. Stevens and Mr.
Chaffey standing for it if they fully
understand its provisions. It should be
called “A Bill to eliminate Competition
with vested Charity Interests.” The Gov-
ernment should withdraw it and substi-
tute for it legislation which will (a) place
the whole of the charity-collection busi-
ness, whether for hospitals or otherwise
and whether by lottery or otherwise,
under the control of the Auditor-General
or the Registrar of Friendly Societies ;
( b ) require the publication of a detailed
annual report on the activities of charities ;
(c) license all agencies and persons who
make a living by collecting charitable
funds or selling lottery syndicate shares,
fixing their maximum percentage of
profits, exacting fidelity bonds, and col-
lecting enough from them to pay for
administration of the Act; (d) co-
ordinate all collections and regulate Ihe
maximum amount which may be col-
lected by each registered charity in
accordance with its annual needs, having
regard to the needs of other bodies.
Something more is, of course, required.
The matter can never be fully dealt with
until the Commonwealth takes a hand,
and until there is agreement between
State Governments so that inter-State
abuses may be scotched.
DISPERSAL OF LITTLE LON.
General Blamey, the Vic. Police Com-
missioner, congratulated himself at a lun-
cheon address in Melbourne on having
stamped out Little Lon. He likened the
job to that of fire-suppression ; but the
women who carried on their ancient
trade in that portion of Melbourne
were not stamped out, nor were they im-
prisoned. They were just dispersed. So
they are still in existence somewhere.
It is too much to suppose that many
of them have abandoned their profes-
sion. The chances are that there are now
dozens of Little Lons, scattered about the
murkier suburbs, if not in other parts of
the metropolitan area. In fact, it is well
known that one of the new stamping-
grounds is St. Kilda-road.
To know what happens when this is
the case General Blarney might consider
Singapore. In that cosmopolitan mart
there used to be a section called Malay-
street—not one street, really, but half a
dozen. It contained fallen women of
every nationality except English, the
Government drawing the line at fellow-
countrywomen for reasons of prestige.
Malay-street had a reputation of a
sort, of which it was jealous. If any
house was suspected of accepting native
custom it was disciplined by the others
in various effective, if not violent, ways,
as the area was supposed to be exclu-
sively for whites; even the Eurasian
was tacitly excluded. Most of the estab-
lishments maintained voluntary medical
inspection, there being no official sur-
veillance, and inmates detected with v.d.
were promptly quarantined. Any house
that violated this rule was severely dealt
with. The system was rough, ready and
obviously far from perfect, but “the
line,” as Malay-street was called, had at
least a higher reputation for safety than
houses outside the area.
Came the war and military dictator-
ship. Most of the brasshats being old
men, full of uplift, there was a wave of
moral indignation against Malay-street,
and with the assistance of bishops the
military had it closed down. After the
war prostitution was found to be as rife
as ever in Singapore and v.d. was far
more prevalent. Gradually Malay-street
resumed its old activities.
The next thing that happened was the
League of Nations. This body has a
social-hygiene department of busybodies
which aspires to legislate for the moral
welfare of the world, its regeneration
from the vice of war being beyond the
League’s capacity. Terrified of the moral-
ists the local Government agreed to carry
out the League’s decrees, so the shutters
once more went up in Malay-street, and
prostitution was declared illegal. The
result to date is a steady increase of
v.d. amongst whites.
The police in Melbourne are not re-
sponsible for scattering the fire that used
to be concentrated in Little Lon. They
are obliged to carry out the wishes of
the City Council. It is blatant hypocrisy
to pretend that this body is tackling the
social evil comprehensively. The truth
is that Little Lon., scattered or com-
pacted, is no longer the most important
problem. Prostitution is on the decline
in most parts of the world. It is cer-
tainly on the decline in Melbourne.
The woman of the town is now facing
the furious competition of what might
be called the New Morality. The New
Morality is a direct consequence of the
discovery of more or less effective birth-
control measures, of their cheapness due
to mass production and of the spread of
contraceptive knowledge ; also, in a less
degree, of the knowledge of prophylaxis.
This knowledge is no longer confined to
the well-to-do and the superiorly edu-
cated. If you take a walk through the
cheap shopping areas of any great city
you will find chemists’ shops stuffed with
the goods and bookshops stuffed with the
information.
The New Morality takes the form of
a growing belief amongst the younger
generation that virtue is not necessarily
synonymous with chastity. No figures
are available for Melbourne, but an in-
vestigation in the U.S.A. elicited that, out
of 100 men examined, 67 admitted hav-
ing had sexual intercourse before mar-
riage and only four had all their rela-
tionships with prostitutes. There have
been many even more significant dis-
coveries. Whether we like it or not, this
amounts to a revolution. It shifts the
problem from Little Lon. to far more
“respectable” quarters.
In the old days, if matrons thought
about Little Lon. at all they regarded it
as a sort of insurance for their daugh-
ters ; and so did bishops. It has long since
ceased to discharge this function, and,
even if General Blarney’s crusade were
successful, it would have no effect on
the major problem, concerning which
several alternatives present themselves to
the reformers. One is to bury their
heads in the sand, in accordance with
their custom. Another is to embark
on a campaign of suppression—a hope-
less proposition. A third is to accept the
new situation and try to mitigate its
worse dangers. One such is that birth-
control literature is still expensive, and
that a lot of it is erroneous, if not fraudu-
lent.
The pretence that things of which
everyone is aware do not exist permits
the quack to flourish and leaves the
abortionist to visit society’s revenge on
the ignorant.
NAKHODA.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australian Man—Australian
Machine.
Most sensible people dislike stunting,
whether in the air or on the ground, and
Kingsford Smith deserves the thanks of
his country for the manner in which he
has lifted the overseas flight from the
sensational to the practical.
There is never any undue self-adver-
tising about this Australian’s efforts. He
does not set a bad example to youngsters
by flying when he is not fit to fly. When
he is sick he comes down. His object is
always to arrive where he set out to
arrive, irrespective of time. The result
is that where most famous fliers are one-
or two-flight men he now has half a
dozen pioneering feats to his credit, some
of which have not been emulated by
others.
His breaking of the existing record
from London to Australia by 40 hours —
he flew from Lympne to Wyndham
in a trifle over days—is all
the more satisfactory because it has
been achieved in a machine designed by
an Australian, Edgar Percival; but it is
a lasting pity that with such a flier and
such a designer—Percival could not make
a living here before he went to England—
Australia should not be using their joint
experience on the spot to develop Aus-
tralian aircraft types which would lead
the world.
Australia produced the first men to
fly from Europe to the Antipodes, with
heavy and light ’planes both ; the first to
fly across the North Polar regions ; the
first to cross the Pacific ; the first to cross
the Tasman ; the firs! to cross in a light
’plane from S. America to Africa, and
one of the two or three to cross direct
from Europe to America. Yet in Aus-
tralia aeroplane building languishes,
imported machines are dearer than any-
where else in the world, and commercial
companies are ruthlessly suppressed by
socialised land-transport interests. Two
capitals, Melbourne and Sydney, are
probably the only two white cities in the
world of equal size within 500 miles of
each other which are not joined by an
aerial mail service. Fliers of international
reputation can make a living here only
by taking flappers up for joyrides.
And now we are to have a service
connected with the outside world which,
if somebody does not wake up suddenly,
will be instituted on a basis of speeds so
slow that nobody but a bullocky-minded
Government would put up with them.
The Old -age Pensions Bill.
After the restrictions imposed last
year, some of which were hard on
elderly people who had saved a little,
12,074 persons surrendered their old-age
and invalid pensions to the end of
June. All the same, the expenditure,
£10,771,000, was £271,000 more than the
estimates.
The Government proposes to add half
a crown a week to pensions below
17s. 6d. a week, and estimates the outlay
for 1933-34 at £11,000,000. All experi-
ence suggests that it will be a good deal
more ; in any case, it is sure to exceed
the revenue from income tax (reckoned
at £9,300,000), and land tax (£1,250,000),
with perhaps estate duties (£1,130,000)
thrown in. Yet on returns from pro-
perty exceeding £5500 Commonwealth
tax is still Bs. 6d. in the £ of taxable
income, with another ss. or so to be
found for ihe State.
Labor politicians of both groups made
it clear before the debate on the Finan-
cial Relief Bill began that the restora-
tion of the old-age pension to £1 a week
is going to be one of their main election
cries. That would mean paying out about
£14,000,000 the first year, and unless
wool and wheat prices become definitely
and regularly profitable it would be im-
possible for industry to stand it and
employ the legions of workless at the
same time ; but the Labor politician was
never one to worry about such considera-
tions when there were perhaps half a
million votes to be gained. As things are,
15s. a week is quite as much as a coun-
try with armies of unemployed and boys
who have never worked to provide for
can afford to pay, though by judicious
tax-cuts it is possible to make fifteen
shillings go further than a pound would
when the pension was a pound.
The U.A.P. ought to be preparing to
enlarge the old-age pensions scheme by
tacking a contributory plan on to it.
Even before some genius conceived the
notion of recovering pension-money from
the small estates of the dead (a whole
£9OOO has been got in this way) thrifty
old people in a small way were penalised
for being thrifty. Those who put their
savings into a bit of property, hoping to
do without the pension, are, in many
cases, worse off than' pensioners who
never tried to save a shilling in their
lives.

Trouble at Canberra.
The Prime Minister is facing a difficult
situation at Canberra. Earle Page has
declared that he will move amendments
to the Government’s old-age pensions
proposals in the direction of freeing pen-
sioners’ property from the Government
mortgage in effect fastened on it, and of
liberalising the administration, which—
so much power being delegated to offi-
cialdom—is too apt to be harsh ; and, as
usual, Earle Page is in earnest. The
Country party will also move for the
abolition of the land tax and of the super
tax on property income—2s. in the £,
now to be reduced to Is.
Whether the Country party’s move is
born of a kind heart or of political
astuteness it is on a winner. If Lyons
said “Put your proposals to the
vote” the Government would be
defeated on the old-age pensions issue,
and would be forced to go to the
country. Then the Country party
would fight it on taxation reduction and
the wheat agreement; the Labor party
would fight it on the pensions question ;
and the U.A.P. would be routed. There-
upon Australia would have a Labor
Government worse than the last, and
everything which has been done at home
and abroad in the interests of Australia’s
credit would be undone.
It is unlikely to come to that, but the
Yaps will have to speak firmly to the
veteran Labor-socialist they placed at
the head of their party. They should
insist, not only on his doing justice to
pensioners who put a little away for
their declining years, but on his con-
ferring with the Cocky chief on the de-
tails of the latter’s scheme for cutting
taxation further.
At the same time, it would be shock-
ing if the Country party were to use
such a matter as that from which the
crisis has developed to wreck a Govern-
ment which it cannot hope to replace,
except as part of a coalition. In view
of the number of matters on which
Lyons’s own followers particularly
those in the Senate —are almost bound to
desert him during the coming session, it
is essential that the U.A.P. and the C.P.
should arrive at an early agreement over
the whole range of probable legislation.
Earle Page, no less than Lyons, must
realise his responsibility to Australia in
this matter.

Bounty on Wheat.
Last year members of the Westralian
Wheatgrowers’ Union celebrated the
approach of Christmas by picketing sid-
ings and declaring that they would hold
up deliveries until the Government paid
a bonus of 6d. a bushel. The P.P.U. in
the same State demanded that wheat-
exporting countries should be brought
together to arrange a cut in wheat areas
by 20 per cent.
They are to have their cut —15 per
cent, on export quantities—and they
have been led to believe that the price
will rise to 4s. a bushel. Instead, there
has been another fall; the Sydney
market at the moment is banging with
slipping fingers to 2s. 6jd., and world
prices, present and future, show a weak-
ening tendency.
Like Trochu, the mystery-man of the
siege of Paris, Stewart, the Minister of
Commerce, says he has a plan, but
details are unavailable. His calculators
have shown themselves at fault about the
size of the crop. The speculative element
in the market seems to be trying to create
a panic. Sales to China and Japan, which
have been great buyers of our wheat
these last two years, have dropped to
nothing since it was given out that U.S.A.
wheat is to be dumped into those coun-
tries “at the price of dirt.” Canberra is
imploring Uncle not to blackleg on his
mates. He is not without a certain queer
chivalry, and the appeal may have an
effect on him ; but, on the other hand,
it may not.
The wheatgrowers have a special claim
on the community. They have never had
a chance to recover from the effects of
the blow administered to them by the
1930-31 Government, which urged them
to Grow More Wheat, guaranteed them
4s. a bushel at siding, and left them to
get along with about half the price. They
must be helped, and no better plan has
presented itself than that of a sales tax
on flour, sufficient to give them 4d. a
bushel at least. If the help is not forth-
coming many of them will be unable to
continue the struggle.
Different Kinds of Prosperity.
Mr. Lang, who conferred the tin-hare
bookmaker on N. S. Wales, referred to
the Stock Exchange the other day as a
gambling den, Pitt-street gold-mining
cos. being the particular subject of his
wrath. Many bitten “investors” will
agree with him. A far greater volume
of speculation, however, is going on
among investment stocks, only the
punters have been winning; the past
three months were very hard on bears
who didn’t grow horns.
So long as the Stock Exchange doesn’t
drain money from legitimate industry,
this burst of speculation is not likely to
do much harm, except to those who
dabble too long and confidently. It
helps to stimulate spending, and to re-
store the capital of those whose savings
were halved, or worse, by slump, but
who kept their heads and hung on, Those,
who didn’t hang on have provided specu-
lators with some nice profits. Broken
Hill Props., for instance, have risen 265.
over the last 18 months.
But the Stock Exchange can be taken
as an indicator of conditions only with-
in limits. The present strong wave of
buying is generally speculative, investors
mostly buying to sell. It anticipates trade
recovery, and has been greatly influenced
by the wool sales. Promised reductions in
taxation and a general improvement in all
balance sheets to June 30 last have also
been a tonic.
N. S. Wales building activity (which
gives employment, whereas the Stock Ex-
change doesn’t) during August, 1933, was
more than double that for the same
month in 1932. These are the figures that
really count ; as those in business and
on the dole know, Stock Exchange buoy-
ancy can be deceiving.

“So This Is W.A.!”
Lyons will spend £4OO this year so that
when Collier and Scaddan decide to cut
Westralia adrift they may know exactly
where to make the. slash. There is no
properly surveyed W.A.-S.A. boundary,
and the unlucky border people, such as
there are, do not know which State they
are in or who has the right to collect
their taxes.
From two points, north and south,
strong, hardy men are to go into the
desert and draw a line some hundreds of
miles long. At every mile they will lay
down a piece of galvanised-iron tube,
2ft. in diameter and filled with con-
crete, a copper plate, firmly attached,
showing the exact position. The markers
will be buried so that the blacks will
not steal them, ahd a cairn of stones -
will be erected on top of each to make
assurance doubly sure.
It is a happy thought. In future the
lost explorer—every explorer gets lost
once in a while —will merely need to go
east or west until he sees a cairn. Then,
after a bit of quarrying, he will know
that he has merely to walk 400 miles
north or south to reach a pub. If pur-
sued by dingoes on his march the
cairns will provide him with ammunition.
Taxpayers, too, will find it even a
better arrangement than the present one.
If a tax-collector gives an assurance
that you are in W.A., you may be for
all you know. But with cairns, gal-
vanised-iron and copper plates it will be
different. The harassed grazier now need
only keep up two homes—he can build
them by sweating the cairns and by ex-
tracting a bit of iron, which, having been
buried, will not be missed by its real
owners. If camels approach from the
west and he is in W.A., he need only
transfer his swag a few yards east to
become a South Australian. If assailed
on that side, he can return to W.A.
Should two lots of squeezers come at
him at once —well, what a thing a cairn
is to play hide and seek round!
The best position, of course, will be
at the point where W.A., S.A. and the
N.T. join. There, at the trifling cost of
a third shanty, electors should be almost
entirely safe from interference.
It’s well worth £4OO.

Brisbane’s Trams Pay.
Brisbane tramways, run as a private
concern until after the war, are still
showing what can be done by a public
utility which is reasonably well managed
and prepared to look facts in the face.
In the old days the company paid
handsome dividends; now the aim is
not to pay dividends —the concern does
not look on itself as a taxing machine
like the Post Office —but a margin of net
profit, which for 1932-33 is equal to
1.2 p.c. on traffic income, always is
achieved after providing for expenses
and interest on loans, depreciation and
amortisation.
With working expenses of 68.24 p.c.
of total revenue, the percentage of net
earnings to capital is 10.29 p.c. this year,
and surplus of revenue over working ex-
penses is greater by £14,000 out of total
income of £683,000 than it was out of
total income of £BlO,OOO in 1928. When
it is said that 7.8 p.c. of tickets sold are
for penny fares and a further 11 p.c. con-
cession tickets at less than 2d., the per-
formance looks all the better. It must
seem almost miraculous to Sydney
people.
Brisbane’s trams face classes of com-
petition which would not be tolerated
in southern cities—that, for instance, of
drivers who turn their taxis into ’buses.
Moreover, the trams being a municipal
affair, the Government railways enter into
vigorous competition with them. In some
instances railway fares have been reduced
50 p.c., and have fallen much below
tram fares for the same locality.
One reason for the popularity of Bris-
bane trams with passengers is their
modernity. The northern capital has had
for 14 years trams not unlike those now
being introduced into N. S. Wales. More-
over, since 1923 carrying capacity has
been so extended that the number of
passengers dealt with per car per annum
has fallen from 412,826 to 234,486.
The general manager of the B.T.D. is
G. R. Steer, an old railwayman. Sydney
has cause to regret that he was not born
twins.

Taken to Task.
Unfriendly communication from “Marc
T. Greene, American journalist, Apia,
Samoa, September 28”:
I have just come across a copy of your
publication of August 2, which contains a
cartoon and caricature of the President of the
United States.
I am a long way from being a perfervid
nationalist, and, as a matter of fact, I am
rather more British than American, although
the latter by birth. But such a contemptible
offence against every standard of decency and
international amity as the attempt at humor in
question is certainly highly distasteful to any-
one, except, perhaps, an Australian.
It seems to reveal about the lowest order of
even “Orstrylian” mentality, and that is saying
a good deal.
The cartoon that goaded Mr. Marc T.
Greene to fury was the work of Percival,
the mildest Digger that ever drew a bead
on an enemy. It was not meant to be
offensive, and The Bulletin does not
think it wrung the withers of any mem-
ber of the American colony in Sydney,
though it has heard that some of them
smiled wintrily at the “Here we are again,
Lafayette,” cartoon of Norman Lindsay.
Percival’s was merely a pictorial com-
ment on the change from the “Produce,
Produce! ” policy of the war years to the
“Don’t Produce!” policy of to-day. He
made Mr. Roosevelt a good-looking
gentleman—was much kinder to him, in
fact, than some of the Republican car-
toonists are to their President.
Mr. Roosevelt was represented as ex-
plaining to Rip Van Winkle that he was
paying farmers to destroy part of their
crops. Well, he’s doing that, isn’t he,
Mr. Greere? The First National Bank
of Boston, which courteously sends its
monthly reports to this office, mentions
in the latest “the tax of 4.2 cents per
pound on the first processing of raw
cotton which went into effect on August
1,” and adds:
The Department of Agriculture estimates that
this year’s cotton crop will amount to 12,314,000
bales, after allowance for the ploughing up
of 10,304,000 acres of growing cotton, or 25
p.c. of the total planted.
The eminently respectable “Saturday
Evening Post” refers to another matter:
On April 23 the Government offered
$500,000,000 three-year 2| p.c. Treasury notes,
recommended them particularly to small in-
vestors and explicitly said: “The principal and
interest of the notes will be payable in U.S.
gold coin of the present standard of value.”
Only 33 days later the Government repudi-
ated this contract. A Wall-street house doing
exactly what the Government did would be
open to prosecution under the new Securities
Act.
The Bulletin has published nothing
like that. It does not even carp at Mr.
Roosevelt for surrounding himself with
professors like Mr. Moley and Mr.
Swope. It is a phase through which Aus-
tralia itself passed. At some of those
Premiers’ conferences it would have been
impossible to throw a biscuit in any
direction without hitting a professor.
In short, The Bulletin admires the
effort Mr. Roosevelt is making to put
the unemployed back in jobs, and would
not hurt him for the world. But it
cannot hope to convince Mr. Marc T.
Greene of this, so it will bow its head
in resignation and lick its wounds.
If the gentleman proposes to deny us
Orstrylians the felicity of a visit from
him the nation will try to stagger on
without it. Perhaps he would be wise to
keep away, for this country is short of
kindred spirits. Thick skulls there are,
and thin skins, but the combination is
rare, even among our politicians.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Weightchaser”: I thought I knew a
few good mining yarns, but one which
appears as a fact in a Kenya paper is
out on its own. A lady went to the
Kakamega gold rush in Kenya Colony
and put her first day’s dishings in a small
glass bottle in her tent. A shortsighted
male friend came along for a meal, and,
cooking him an antelope steak, she set
him down to it in the tent while she went
off on other business. When she got back
she found her visitor had mistaken the
alluvial in the bottle for cayenne pepper
and, after liberally dowsing his steak wi th
it, had scoffed the lot. The story ends
there, which is, perhaps, just as well.
* * * *
“Strict Veg.”: Souveniring? A party
of youngsters was being shown over a
Vic. patent-food factory. They had been
solemnly warned by their bear-leader not
to help themselves to anything. In one de-
partment were hundreds of thousands of
“How did you get that mark on your neck?”
“Very pleasantly.”
bright tin discs, employed in canning the
factory’s principal product, and the boys
were each presented with one of these.
Having been duly ' conducted from
one step of the process to another, they
came to the final stage of the pilgrimage,
the room where the finished article was
waiting transportation. After the usual
peroration the manager announced that
each member of the party, as he filed
out, would be presented with two tins
of food, complete with labels. He com-
pleted his speech to a startling sym-
phony. The boys were hastily emptying
their pockets of hundreds of metal discs,
which clattered on the cement floor with
a deafening rattle.

“Nikko”: Touching these failure-to-
vote excuses (B. 11/10/’33). I know a
lady who contented herself with stating
that her mother-in-law had called and
stayed so long she could not get to the
poll in time. In this case, too, the delin-
quent heard no more of the offence.
They evidently had mothers-in-law of
their own.
* * * *
“Timbre”: There is one flaw in the
contention that “the most stinging com-
ment that ever appeared in type on a
public man’s physical peculiarities, real
or alleged, is mild enough beside the
artist’s power to ridicule” (B. 11 /8/’33).
The recent outburst in the N.S.W.
Assembly against an occupant of the
press gallery was provoked by some dis-
paraging comments on the ultra-doleful
quality of a member’s voice, which, the
said member assured a grinning House,
had never been singled out for adverse
mention before ; in fact, it had been gener-
ally admired. The attack on this, which
he evidently regarded as his most un-
assailable asset, was what galled and
stung him beyond endurance. And the
most gifted caricaturist, it must be
admitted, has no means of holding a poli-
tician’s voice up to ridicule.
* * * *
“Pontifex”: It isn’t only professional
artists who look gloomily on bridges as
possible blots on the charms of Nature
(B. 11/10/’33). When John Winthrop
Hackett was the journalistic panjandrum
of Westralia he always set his face sternly
against periodical proposals for the bridg-
ing of the Swan in the neighborhood of
Perth. A mild agitation in the pre-war
years for the linking up of the two banks
at The Narrows, the obvious place,
stirred him almost to wrath. It would
interfere with the beauty of the river,
and in a lesser degree would impede navi-
gation, he asserted, though there is no
real reason why it should do either.' Still,
Perth has never taken its bridge projects
very seriously. The topic is mostly re-
served for election-times, when metro-
politan members or candidates have
sometimes found it useful vote-bait, just
as Henry Parkes did in the Sydney of 40-
odd years ago. An enterprising Minister
in Perth once stiffened his election pro-
gramme with a bold proposal for three
bridges over the Swan, featured where
they were likely to do him most good!
They all remain in the air.
“Antom Sulph.”: Touching these
nauseous medicines (B. 4/10/’33), a
metho.-drinker—a regular visitor—came
into the pharmacy the other day with a
request for some dope for a sore throat,
Dig.” I strolled round the dispensary to
see what I could do for him. Tincture
of podophyllin and extiact of cascara
(not the polite sweetened variety) seemed
a good beginning, with some solution of
Epsom salts to add a bit of bulk to the
mixture. Followed some of “General
Prac.’s” tincture of asafcetida and
ammoniated tincture of valerian, which
wins by a long head from the simple
tincture. I topped the mixture off with
a drachm of the preparation known as
Liquor Santali Compositus cum Buchu
et Cubeba, which tastes ten times as bad
as it sounds. A pinch of bicarbonate of
soda ensured that the repeating powers
“Nice girl you were with last night, Bill. Known her long?"
“Met her at school.”
“Teacher?”
“No; didn’t have to.”
of the brew would not be mitigated, and
I administered my cure-all to the patient,
standing slightly to one side and out of
range. Tossing it off to the last drop, he
gave his verdict: “That’s good, Dig. ;
that’s strong.” I suppose methylated
spirit does knock a man’s palate about
a bit.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: The radio announcer took
his annual leave on a farm in Gippsland
whose owner was pious. Going down to
his first breakfast he
found the farmer and
his family seated before
their steaming porridge
awaiting his arrival.
As a special privilege
the host invited the
visitor to ask a bless-
ing. It was a request
that had not been made
to him since his boy-
hood days and it flus-
tered him. “Well,
folks,” he said after a
painful silence —“well,
folks, this food comes
to you by courtesy of
our Father Which art
in Heaven”!

“Torps”: Henry
Lawson wrote a story
called “The Loaded
Dog,” which describes
an attempt to dynamite
fish. A faithful hound
rescues the plug tossed
into the water and pur-
sues his owners with it.
Details of the new
“infra-red” torpedo re-
call the episode. Dis-
patched in the usual
way the torpedo is con-
trolled by a photo-
electric cell in the nose.
Being thus delicately
sensitive to the heat rays given off from
the ship aimed at, the torpedo follows
the doomed vessel until contact is made,
no matter how the target may twist and
turn in endeavoring to dodge its im-
placable attacker.
* * * *
“Pawang”: An Italian newspaper re-
proves Hitler for ordering women not
to smoke or use cosmetics, “which they
have used since the days of Pharaoh.”
It adds that no power on earth can run
counter to fashion, which is nonsense.
Human nature never changes, but the
way it manifests itself suffers all sorts
of changes. In early-Victorian days
fashion encouraged women to faint at
the mention of a corset, forbade them to
sit on the grass with a person,
obliged them to wear leg-o -mutton
sleeves and crinolines. A critic advised
Thomas Hardy to substitute “sentimental
for “amorous in one of his novels, and
“Oliver l wist ’ was condemned because
it portrayed “outcasts of humanity” and
thus tended to degrade “the happy ignor-
ance of innocence.” The time came when
all those dictates of fashion were over-
boarded ; nowadays we have Marie
Stopes and backless bathing costumes.
What brought about the change? I sug-
gest that it was due to the fact that indus-
try stood in need of all the labor it could
get and women were winning economic
independence. The pendulum is now
swinging the other way owing to the
artificial scarcity created by the depres-
sion, so women are being driven out of
industry and being reduced to their
ancient status of dependant on a male
provider. Having their old power back
the males are reverting to type and apply-
ing the old Puritanism to the eternal
feminine.
* * * *
“Mooni”: “Australian naval men, with
green and gold ribbons streaming from
their coats,” came to applaud their coun-
trymen, according to a cable, in the
Rugby League Test match. Green and
gold, I take it, are now the firmly estab-
lished colors of Australian representative
cricketers and footballers alike. I wonder
whether the genesis of them is a line
in Kendall’s “After Many Years,” per-
haps the most touchingly beautiful poem
ever written in Australia. Athletes are
not passionately addicted to poetry, as a
rule, but the theory is at least tenable.
Any other explanations?
* * * *
“Dundas”: Of the 49 counties of Eng-
land, says an Adelaide newspaper, only
two (Rutland and Huntingdon) were un-
represented in the orders for Australian
Christmas lambs. The paragraph arrested
me because in my remote schooldays
there were only 40 English counties, but
I find on consulting a modern reference
that even 49 is under the mark nowa-
days —for administrative purposes there
are 50. Time was when London wasn’t
counted as a distinct entity ; likewise the
Isfe of Wight and the Isle of Ely had
no separate existences. These account
for an additional three, and the other
seven have been obtained by splitting
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire into three
divisions apiece, Suffolk and Sussex into
another two apiece, and cutting the
Soke of Peterborough out of Northamp-
tonshire. Altogether, the “New States”
principle seems to have made more pro-
gress in England this last 60 years than
it has in Australia.
SUMMER A LA SWINBURNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now the hounds of spring have made winter
non est,
And mighty soon, it’s a dead-sure thing,
The hounds of summer, as staunch and honest,
Will be hot and hard on the heels of spring;
Now the brown meat-pic mysterious
Is losing half of its stimulus,
And of all Taronga’s beasts the wannest
Is the great white bear from the Arctic ring.
Come, with bent elbows and foaming pewters,
Season of brewers’ and Bungs’ delight;
With smack of sixes and smash of shooters
That skittle the rabbit’s stumps outright.
Climb into your bathers, surf queens sweet,
These backless beach-suits are hard to beat,
And shy spring swains will be summer suitors
Round pale-pink trilbies and ankles white.
For the vernal flutters are all but over;
The warm tint deepens on satin skins;
The household cat is once more a rover
With a growing penchant for moonlight spins;
Warm wool’s discaided for silk or cotton;
Topcoats are banished and furs forgotten;
The blithe bees buzz in the bursting clover
And beers taste better than rums or gins.
There are lemon-squashes and orange-crushes,
There are luscious berries, and cream to boot;
The fair fresh cheek of the flapper flushes
As she sets white teeth in her favored fruit;
And the punters pant, and the books perspire,
As their bassos blend in the “Bar-one” choir
Where the imperturbable copper brushes
The n.g. briefs with an o.s. foot.
Now the summer hounds' are on springtime’s
traces, _
Full-cry they push her, by hill and flat;
And there’s fuller shade for the naiads’ faces
And a broader brim for the wood-nymph’s
hat.
The lids abhorrent in artists’ eyes
Are fast expanding to summer size.
And I seem to hear in a thousand places
A heartfelt murmur “Thank God for that!”

T. THE R.


“Modern”: How the legal profession
lpves its little pedagogic ceremonials!
“S.M.H.”’ had a three-col. ad. in which
Clerk of Parliaments Calvert gave notice
that an election of the Leg. Council
would take place on October 19. Cal-
vert’s encyclical contains six “and
thats,” two “in pursuances” two
“saids” and one “do hereby,” and is a
miracle of legal brevity, but it has as
appendage a letter from George Rex to
Calvert containing eight “whereases,”
thirteen references to “Our Governor of
Our said State,” fourteen other refer-
ences to “Our said State” and a splen-
did outcrop of capital “ands” and “This
Our Writs.” Any lawyer will aver that
if but one of those “saids” and “where-
ases” or capitalised “ands” and “nows”
were omitted, the whole business might
be held to be invalid by a Judge. I doubt
it. An intention, however complex, can
be expressed in plain English more for-
cibly and more clearly than in archaic
legal phraseology.

“F.A.R.”: lam glad to meet someone
who can find beauty in Broken Hill’s
“quivering, simmering, pulsating mass
and vermilion banks of sand” (B.
27/9/’33); to me, unhappily, living there
"Go on, silly! I’ve
been married for
years and years.”
"Double harness, what?
Well, that won’t pre-
vent you having a
trot in my single-
seater.”
for the best part of my life, it repre-
sented nothing more than one d d
duststorm after another. The grit blown
from the mine dumps into my home
blinded me to the “angular beauties” of
the grubby mine structures, although I
admit they were always full of scientific
interest, and quite agree that Goodhart
has depicted them well. The Sturt
desert pea and other wild flora are un-
doubtedly beautiful for a very short
period of the year, but, unless you own
a conveyance, the walk to see them is
a pretty hot one. I still recall those
annual picnics to Silverton, Stephen’s
Creek and the Gorge, and how we swel-
tered and scorched at each of them, and
none the less looked forward to the out-
ings. But I am afraid it was the fun of
riding in the trucks, not the beauty of
the surroundings, that appealed. Frankly,
Broken Hill’s beauties, as depicted by
“Desert Singer,” are beyond me. The
place has an appeal of its own in its
history and associations, and its people
would be hard to beat anywhere in the
world, but —I let it go at that!
* * * *
“Adelaide”: A man in S.A., pleading
guilty to “assault” on a girl under 15,
put in two pleas: first, that he be-
lieved her to be 18 at least, and she
looked it; second, that she and another
girl had since waylaid him and thrown
acid in his face, so that he has lost one
eye, with the other still in doubt. Judge
Murray agreed that he had been pun-
ished enough. Next day the girls (now
23 and 16) pleaded guilty, but alleged
that he had ruined them both under pro-
mise of marriage, and, meeting by acci-
dent, they had discovered the truth and
combined to spoil his beauty—but with
no thought of blinding him. The same
Judge said that corrosive liquid was un-
heard of in S.A., and gave the older one
(who did the actual throwing) two years,
the younger one “probation.”

“Leather Cuff”: It is a strange com-
mentary on the ineptness of trade-union
organisation that Sydney has just set on
its tramway rails the first car that be-
trays the slightest consideration for the
safety of the man who collects fares, and
that the innovation has been sponsored
by an Administration that doesn’t depend
on trade-union members for votes. The
new car is of the enclosed-cabin-cnra-
corridor type, and while it will carry a
large overload without risk of passengers
falling off, it isn’t as well adapted to
short-trip, short-stop traffic as the old
open-both-sides chariots. Christchurch
(M.L.), which claims to have the best
electric-tramway service in Australasia,
went into all the pros and cons when the
juice became available from Lake Col-
eridge 28 years ago—Sydney lines were
electrified six years earlier—and plumped
for corridor-type cars half as long again
as the new Sydney ones with cabins both
ends and, open both sides, in the middle.
A bar, adjustable in a moment on either
side of the car, ensures that passengers
alight on the safe side. Yankee engineer
Chamberlain argued that this type would
suit both long-distance and short-distance
passengers, and give the conductor a fair
spin, and in practice the arrangement has
worked very satisfactorily.
“Philm”: Few visitors
who charge Australians
with lack of politeness
have as genuine a cause
for complaint as a French-
man who, attending a trot-
ting meeting at Perth,
sought at the tote window, in slightly
broken English, “a ticket on Wild Cat,
please .” It was only after his horse had
won, paying over £8 straight-out, that
he discovered he had been given a place
ticket. Nothing will now persuade him
that “please” forms part of the Aus-
tralian vocabulary.

“C.Q.”: Behind the success of Eric
Conroy, a young man of 24, who won a
voice test at Melbourne Princess, against
500 competitors, with an abnormally
beautiful baritone, lies a remarkable
story. Not long ago Conroy could not
sing a note, and had no voice to speak
of. His teacher was Theophilus Roberts,
who, in the course of curing post-nasal
growths and catarrhal troubles by a
scientific-cttm-musical method of his
own, has been turning mouth-breathers
into efficient vocalists for 20 years or so.
Some of his most spectacular cures have
been performed on soldiers. During the
war The Bulletin reported several
"Stop staring like that! It’s only a painting.”
"C-c-c-can I help it if I was born with imagination?”
such ; the other day he added another
with a Digger who had been deaf since
the days in France and now can hear a
clock ticking. Another case is that of
a woman of 35 who was dumb for 11
years, and after eight days’ treatment
produced a remarkably rich soprano,
When sitting at the piano, Roberts
strikes particular notes, and his patients
sing them after him. His method looks
so simple that it is hard to believe that
V°° k \k !i. fe " me 1° per i ect -
who is Melbourne-born, does not adver-
tise. His patients do that for him.

“Indcav”: Speaking of far-flung Aus-
tralians (B. 20/9/’33), they aren’t all men.
In the Waziristan campaign on the
Indian Frontier in 1919-20, we came
across two Australian women who had
married Wazir camel-drivers in West-
ralia and accompanied them to their
mountain homes. There was little to
make the women look out-of-place in
their new environment, for many of the
tribesmen have blue eyes and fair hair,
a reminder of Alexander’s ancient in-
vasion of India. The Australians seemed
quite contented with their lot, and if
anything were distinctly disgruntled at
our presence in the area. The troops
that returned from the Afghanistan War
of 1919 also brought news of Australian
women among the Afghans.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: The best climate for any-
body anywhere is “the one you have been
accustomed to” (B. 27/9/’33). Correct,
I ended my last visit to England in De-
cember, after weeks of fog and rain and
slush, almost apologetic about leaving
those who farewelled me to further
months of it. But there was no need to
pity them ; they were “accustomed to
it.” Two of them lied cheerfully, even
while putting racquet and bicycle away
till April: “After all, for getting about
and doing things it’s the finest climate
in the world.” And they believed it, too.
When I repeated thisj wonderingly, to a
Scotch M.P., he went one better: “Yes,
referring particularly, of course, to the
country north of the Tweed.”
~ ,
I.P. : Calling tor a juvenile descend-
ant at a children’s birthday party, I
thought of my own similar shivoo 50
years ago. I recalled the youngsters,
bashful girls in pantalettes, boys with
plastered, oiled hair, “Maiden’s Prayer,”
“Battle of Prague,” “Me Name Is Nor-
val,” cake, bananas, raspberry vinegar
and bread and butter smothered with
“hundreds and thousands.” A general
move-off at eight to go to bed, and a
muttered farewell “Mum said to say
‘Thanks’ nice.” The other night the
younglings, blase and critical, sang not,
neither did they play nor recite. Boys of
tender years invited tiny damsels to dance
to the strains of wireless or gramophone.
Dad, with whom I smoked a pipe,
thought the whole business dam’ rot; but
“the missus says everybody does it.” My
party cost five bob ; his ran into pounds,
with a supper table fit for an adult show.
My particular lassie made a farewell
speech of gratitude with aplomb; and
on the way home at midnight gabbled of
leading talkie stars, smirked “Thanks so
much for seeing me home” and tripped
up her garden path—she’s S-}! Yes,
things have changed.

“Runa”: If there are any more Cook
cottages available I suggest that M.L. has
a better right to them than either Sydney
or Melbourne. Maorilanders are reared
in Cook traditions, and the Dominion
has bestowed on the great navigator the
highest honor possible, in that she suffers
her grandest mountain, Aorangi, to be
known as Mt. Cook, though the aestheti-
cally-minded nowadays revert to the
Maori name. The Bay of Plenty and
Poverty Bay, on the east coast, can both
offer exact spots sacred to the memory
of Cook, and on either of these a cottage,
whether from Yorkshire or the Mile End-
road, could repose more appropriately
than anywhere in Australia.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Some years ago a well-known
Melbourne mining speculator left
£lOO,OOO, half to relatives in Victoria and
the rest to next-of-kin elsewhere. A
determined search started for the latter.
Inquiries went back to the Battle of
Trafalgar, the relevant ancestor having
been traced in an apothecary who
travelled on the sloop which carried the
news of the death of Nelson to London.
This gentleman married a lady at Ply-
mouth, and the family tree put out
branches in all directions. Until a few
months ago the nearest-of-kin was the
wife of a poverty-stricken shoemaker in
London. The late Leo Cussen awarded
her the prize, but she died a couple of
days afterwards and the search had to
begin all over again. When I was a boy
an aunt told me that I was part heir to
a million or so in Chancery, my ancestor,
a pirate or privateersman in the
Napoleonic wars, having died leaving
his money to a wife, the record of whose
marriage had been burnt along with the
church they had been married in. I
remember my mother reproving my aunt
for giving me this dangerous piece of
intelligence, several relatives having
already wasted their money in storming
the gates of Chancery and an uncle
being even then engaged in ruining him-
self by the same process. For some years
I used to dream of phantom millions. I
forgot them after entering the prosaic
paths of commerce.
BALLADE OF A BISHOP’S GAITERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Canon How, who has been invited to become
Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, is wondering if
lie can live on £lOOO a year.”
Time was they were featured happy as kings;
In palaces, too, ’twas theirs to dwell,
With their pastoral staffs and robes and rings
And an income commonly counted swell.
They had rank so high, they were paid so
well,
That they’d nothing to envy legislators.
Now it’s t’other way round, the parallel,
Does the glamor fade from a bishop’s gaiters?
The bruiser’s art still a guerdon brings
That the wildest dreams of the past excel;
The golden notes that a diva sings
Will still a glittering fortune spell;
Still, ’spite Depression, best-sellers sell
As ne’er before and enrich creators;
But, passing sad as it is to tell,
The ticket’s down on a bishop’s gaiters.
The tennis champ, who his status slings
And steers _ a course for where dollars yell,
What would it be by his reckonings
But the merest, paltriest bagatelle?
A thou, a year! Why, it might repel,
As a steady possie, the gladiators
Who give Hillites raptures and bowlers hell.
And how does it click with a bishop’s gaiters?
Brother, should you and I rebel
At our valuations and valuators?
Should we jib at inches with such an ell,
An ell so shrunk, for a bishop’s gaiters?

POLITICAL POINTS
Declaring that it would take part no
longer in negotiations for arms reduction
“as a second-class Power without rights,
Germany has quitted the Disarmament
Conference and says it will leave the
League of Nations. A tremendous fuss
is being made about it in Europe ; but
the Disarmament Conference has been
dragging on fruitlessly for the best part
of two years, and other countries have
withdrawn from the League without
shaking the world. Hindenburg has dis-
solved the Reichstag, and there is to be
another general election next month. A
significant feature ; probably the whole
business means that Hitler is losing his
hold on the Germans and hopes to
strengthen it by a dramatic appeal to
nationalism.
It looks a*s if Vic. Leg. Assembly will
salute its first skirted member shortly,
the widow of Speaker Peacock having
decided to contest the constituency her
husband represented. S’Peacock was an
institution in Allandale, and his lady got
to know its requirements and aspirations
as intimately as he did.
Allandale is not the only Vic.
Assembly electorate which is to have a
by-election. Warmambool’s member Fair-
bairn is to be the U.A.P. candidate for
Federal Flinders. The contest won’t be
as easy as the last one was for Bruce,
but Fairbairn ought to hold the seat.
He bears an honored name, and his own
achievements are considerable.
The Liverpool canon who was asked
to be Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane
is not coming. He found that the pay
was below the recognised rate for
bishops, and, being a member of the
union in good standing, he turned the
job in. It may be the beginning of a
strike, but there is no danger of violence.
Queensland industrial law permits peace-
ful picketing.
Commonwealth railways report a loss
of £39,000 for 1932-33, which looks small
against £150,445 for 1929-30. But the
figures exclude interest. Some of the
Commonwealth lines, such as that to
Alice Springs, run from sandhill to sand-
hill, and the stations are merely empty
sheds filled with drifts. Economy can
be obtained by taking off a few trains
which nobody uses except the guard and
an odd passenger or so. Even a falling-
off of £95,684 in earnings cannot prevent
things improving in such circumstances.
After making a circus of itself for an
hour or more, Vic. Assembly went into
committee in another part of Parliament
House and balloted for the Speakership.
Maurice Blackburn, the Labor lawyer,
was the winner (others proposed were ex-
Premier Allan, Chairman-of-Committees
Everard and ex-Ministers Groves and
Knox), and members returned to the
House, where Blackburn was appointed
in due form. While the circus turn was
on Gray, Drew, Shields and Barry were
put up for a ride and tossed off. In deri-
sion Holland suggested Councillor Baron
Marks, of Melbourne City Council, who
was in the gallery. Marks rose and
bowed profoundly.
Queensland Labor is extending the life
of the State Wheat Pool for five years,
its existence having terminated with the
sale of the last harvest. Growers, the
chairman says, “will hail the reappoint-
ment with a great deal of satisfaction.”
He does, anyhow.
That great anti-war man Chapman,
secretary of the N.S.W. railwaymen’s
such questions as whether guards on
such questions as to whether guards on
brake vans that use gas shall be supplied
with matches. He said over the air that
“the Government and the Transport ad-
ministrators are sitting on a volcano” and
inveighed against “political interference.”
This is rich, coming from the boss of a
union which a few years ago gave Lang
a wireless set as a reward for political
interference on its behalf.
To redeem pre-election promises,
Westralian Government sawmills had to
find £15,000 last financial year for long-
service leave to the sturdy fellows about
the mills. The loss was £16,000, so they
got nearly the lot.
Just when it was settling down to
dream of the restored salary increments,
Queensland civil service was rudely
awakened with an intimation that these
would be subject to reductions of 10 p.c.
to 20 p.c. There’s always a catch some-
where.
“I ask yez, what is capital?”
"Well, boay, if you was to ask all av we to come and ’ave a drop o' beer
that would be capital.”
Speaker Blackburn is wearing the wig,
gown and other appurtenances of his
ancient office. He thought of discarding
them, but decided that if he did he would
be letting down friends who cling to
tradition. In Shaw’s “The Apple Cart”
a Labor Minister calls on the King in
scarlet pants, top boots, an open shirt
and a leather belt with a pistol in it, and
remains sitting when the sovereign en-
ters. However, when a princess tells him
he looks too screamingly funny he turns
up in the next act in the boiled shirt and
sac suit of commerce.
In the course of a brisk controversy
at Toowoomba (Q.), George Dewar, a
local Labor man, said Littleton Groom
owed his seat to Theodore. Theo.
arranged that Groom should have no
Labor opposition. In other words, he
saved Groom ; himself he could not save.
Moved by the plight of unemployed
blowers of brazen instruments, the
Forgan Smiths have set up a Govern-
ment band. Queensland has many
private-enterprise bands, and the intru-
sion of the State has raised Gehenna.
Maddened musicians who are not in the
band are crying that players are being
brought from other States. There are
other objections, but the new body, re-
splendent in a uniform which would
make the president of a negro republic
bow his humbled head, is carrying on.
The Customs regulation enjoining the
stamping of goods with the name of the
country of origin may be withdrawn.
“Injurious differentiation,” the British
manufacturer calls it. He had another
name for the thing when he induced his
Government to impose the “Made in
Germany” label on all goods coming
into Britain from that country ; but that,
of course, was in Victoria’s day, and
some queer people flourished then. For
example, the London fishmonger who
believed in Freetrade in everything but
herring.
Halse Rogers, J., has delivered an in-
teresting judgment in the appeal case of
a bookie who won £10,300, partly in
N.S.W. and partly in Vic., by backing
a horse called Amounis, and was charged
N.S.W. income tax on it. His Honor
ruled that appellant was taxable on his
winnings in N. S. Wales (though a casual
punter would not be) because he mixed
punting and bookmaking—carried on
betting as a business —but not on his Vic-
torian gains. It is a Pyrrhic victory for
the Sydney department, which has been
charging the special income tax called
unemployed-relief tax on income from
Victoria.
Westralia’s Leg. Council won the
wrangle with the Labor Government
over the retroactive clauses of its finan-
cial-emergency tax on annual income
and weekly wages, and the thing is to
date from the first of October. But it
is improbable that the taxpayer will
in the long run. The tax rises from 4d.
to 9d. in the £, the latter rate being
clapped on salaries and incomes of £8
a week and more. It is higher than
Mitchell’s impost, but that is a way
Labor Governments have.
One of Lang’s Senators has elicited the
information that Australian wheat and
flour to the value of £179,000 sterling
was sent to Russia in 1932-33. To
Russia, whose Communist farms, each
with a squadron of giant tractors, were
going to knock the stuffing out of the
“capitalist” wheat-growing countries.
.Something obviously went wrong with
that part of the Five-Year Plan. Still, it
is not the only Plan that has miscarried.
Beasley, M.H.R., heading a deputation
from the maritime unions, asked the
Minister of Commerce the other day to
protect Australian shipping against the
inroads of heavily subsidised U.S.A. craft,
and Stewart promised to see what he
could do. If the maritime unions had
given the Commonwealth line of
steamers and the Australian shipping
cos. a fair spin the plea might not have
been necessary. In one year alone —
1928—36 disputes cost Australian mar-
iners £312,287 in lost wages ; they were
mainly about ham and eggs for break-
fast and suchlike affairs. It is no use
bemoaning the past, but before anything
substantial can be done for the distressed
unions there will have to be some guar-
antee for the future. Every stoppage is
a tax on shipping which puts Australia
at a disadvantage in the struggle for
trade.
Ramsay MacDonald wants another
economic conference. When the last one
was petering out, a London journalist,
Wickham Steed, turned savagely on him,
saying the country had had enough of
ministering to Ramsay’s overweening con-
ceit by convening conference after con-
ference which got nowhere. Much the
same remarks have been made by an
historian:
He loved congresses. He was well aware of
the flutter his appearance made and thoroughly
enjoyed the sense of his importance, for there
was a large spice of vanity in his composition.
“It is significant,” he wrote, “to see how my
appearance calls forth the greatest expectation
among the different parties. I cannot stir with-
out making a sensation.”
MacDonald? No, Metternich, the Aus-
trian. Another example of history repeat-
ing itself in an odd way.
Forgan Smith takes credit for the fact
(hat no fresh taxation is to be imposed in
the fourth depression year. The deficit is
to be £1,848,402, as against £1,490,402 last
year, and if the estimate is reached it
will be an utter disgrace. And £3,000,000,
or thereabouts, is to be added to the
public debt—more if Labor can get it.
“E.H.M.”: One of the stupid anomalies
of the tariff, of the sort which add nothing
to real protection but give Governments
a lot of revenue, came to light when the
Tariff Board recommended abolition of
the special duty of £2 British preferential
and £3 general on plated motor radiator
shells. This is to be replaced with
17| p.c. duty on the foreign articles. We
don’t make shells in Australia, but we
plate them ; which involves dismantling
the shell and reassembling it again after
the job. The labor cost involved in these
latter operations is twice that involved
in the plating. So a new duty has been
imposed which runs, in the case of
foreign goods—which we must have
while we import certain types of chassis
—up to 533 per cent, of the plating cost.

Findlay McPherson, who died at Glen
Innes (N.S.W.) lately, was one of the
best horsemen the State boasted. His
parents, the John McPhersons, were
among the earliest New England settlers,
and Findlay lived there most of his life
except for a short time in Queensland.
He was only 63.
Having obtained her flying instructor’s
license, Freda Thompson, of South
Yarra, has become Australia’s first
woman instructor. A Civil Aviation
official in Melbourne declares her to be
the first in the British Empire.
R. H. Way, who had 51 years in
the public service, has retired. Lat-
terly he has been Commonwealth Elec-
toral Officer for Victoria. The Electoral
Offices of most of the other States were
represented in the presentation which
was made to him.
Alex. Gordon has just relinquished
the post of church officer at St.
Andrew’s Presbyterian kirk, Brisbane,
after 37| years’ service. Alex, has
attended more than 1000 weddings, his
record being four in one afternoon. He
has seen the kirk grow from 200 to 600
communicants.
Waldo Jackson Wiley, who has been
awarded the Doctor of Science degree of
Queensland. University, is the second
student to receive the distinction. The
first was Dr. W. H. Bryan, now geology
lecturer, who gained the honor in 1924.
Wiley submitted a thesis on “Acidity of
Dairy Products, with particular reference
to Milk, Cream and Butter,” which was
highly praised by the examiners.
Keith Eliott, Torres Strait pilot, is a
descendant of the man who captured
Gibraltar. His great-grandfather came to
Australia as A.D.C. to Sir George Gipps,
but that potentate desiring him to super-
intend the cooking of the morning steak,
he retired and went north to join Russell
Captain KEITH ELIOTT, well-known
Torres Strait pilot.
<ind Hodgson and the Leslies, who were
beginning to colonise the Darling Downs.
He became first Speaker of the Queens-
land Legislative Assembly. Keith, who
became the youngest T.I. pilot after
holding a substantial naval job in Lon-
don during the war, would not have made
a good Speaker. He has altogether too
much sense of humor. He is a great bar-
racker for Thursday Island, and never
fails to advertise its progress in popula-
tion and prosperity when opportunity
offers.
Frank Clarke, who had trouble in Mel-
bourne a few weeks ago about his re-
volver permit, belongs to the most titled
family in Australia. He is a K.8.E.,
and his father and grandfather were
baronets. William, the original one,
came over from Tasmania in the ’forties,
bringing with him one of the finest crops
of whiskers in the Antipodes and a sound
knowledge of sheep and cattle. With this
capital he pioneered Bolinda Vale, a
magnificent property almost in the sub-
urbs of Melbourne, benefited by the gold
days, built up with the help of his great
herdmaster, Robert Clark, one of the
finest herds of Shorthorn stud cattle in
the world, and died leaving his sons and
grandsons an abundance of the rich
man’s curse and something of his own
business acumen. Frank took to politics,
FRANK CLARKE, President of Vic-
toria’s Leg. Council.
and, after six busy years from 1917-23
as Minister of Lands and Water Supply
and Public Works, became President of
the Vic. Legislative Council in 1923. He
has had the job ever since. In his spare
time he looks after his station proper-
ties, and helps to direct the affairs of
Goldsbrough Mort and the National
Bank. He has an interest in art, and is
a member of the Felton Bequest Com-
mittee.
Having been elected for a third term
as Lud Mayor of Melbourne, Gen-
goult Smith will automatically get
a handle to his name, according to
tradition. The precedent doesn’t go
back to the beginnings of the office,
and there were mayors who were knights
(Benjamin Benjamin, for example) be-
fore they were councillors. Conse-
quently the honor roll in the en-
trance to the civic centre has a ragged
appearance, and is a matter for heart-
burning amongst relatives of former in-
cumbents who didn’t get the gaud.
Few persons can rival the feat of G.
C. Saxby, headmaster at Sydney Boys’
High School, who retires in this the
school’s jubilee year, having risen from
pupil to principal. A country lad, his
association with “High” began as a pupil
in 1884 (the school was then the only
State secondary one and occupied the
present site of David Jones’s), and was
continued in 1893 as a member of the
staff. Finally, after 12 years’ experience
in charge of country high schools, he
was appointed head of “High” nine years
ago. Masters and boys alike will miss
his remarkable energy and virile person-
ality.
Among the outside men likely to
secure inclusion on the U.A.P. ticket for
the N.S.W. Upper House elections is
Archie Howie, of Howie, Moffat and Co.,
builders and contractors. Born in Glasgow
and educated at Fort-street and Sydney
High School, he represents the fourth gen-
eration of builders. Among the structures
erected by his firm are the Mitchell
Library, Long Bay Gaol, and Farmer
and Co.’s premises. Howie is also chair-
man of the board of directors of the
Port Jackson Ferry Co., and outside ol
his metropolitan interests runs a farm in
the Richmond district (N.S.W.).
Retirement from the N.S.W. public
service this month will not mean
empty days for Dr. G. P. Darnell-
Smith, director of Sydney’s Botanic
Gardens since 1927 ; he will go on with
research work, particularly with native
plants. Formerly biologist to the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture, he is an en-
thusiastic sleuth in the pursuit of plant
diseases, and has carried out much valu-
able work on anthrax. His treatment of
seed wheat, to prevent disease, with dry
carbonate of copper is now used
throughout Australia and America. He is
a B.Sc. of Bristol University (Eng.) and
a D.Sc. of Sydney.
Rex and Alan Leeper, sons of Dr.
Alexander Leeper, of Melbourne, have
made great progress in the British
Foreign Office. Alan, who is at present
connected with the League of Nations
department, was assistant private secre-
tary to Lord Curzon and then mentor to
Prince George at the Foreign Office.
A brilliant linguist with a wide practical
knowledge of foreign affairs, Alan distin-
guished himself during the war as an*
officer attached to Lord Gleichen’s In-
telligence Bureau, where, too, Rex, now
controller of the radio and press service
at the Foreign Office, was employed.
They are Melbourne C.E.G.S. boys.
Henry McD. Vincent, new editor of
the Christchurch “Sun” (M.L.), belongs
to a family prominent in journalistic and
literary circles for many generations..
Henry Vincent, the Chartist, who was
imprisoned last century for his criticism
of the constitutional laws of Great
Britain, was a great-uncle. Three of the
Chartist’s brothers went to Maoriland
and became journalists, and the new
Christchurch editor is the grandson of
one of them. Roy Vincent, N.S.W. Mines
Minister, himself a journalist, is a grand-
son of another of the brothers, who left
M.L. to establish papers on the North
Coast of N.S.W. The family has a
baronetcy dating from 1620, Sir Francis
Vincent, of Stoke d’Abernon, being the
13th holder of the title. Another mem-
ber of the family distinguished himself
as British ambassador in Berlin, and was
raised to the peerage a few years ago as
Viscount d’Abernon. The peer, too, is
a writer and an authority on modern
Greek.
E. R. Voigt, manager of the Labor

Uni., he was born at Kiama (N.S.W.).
He practised medicine at Inverell for 32
years, and in the district became one of
a band of leaders in pastoral progress.
Dr. R. M. KINROSS, cattle-breeder
and medico.
He is a notable authority on Guernsey
cattle —is president of the United Pure
Bred Dairy Cattle Association, of the
Federal Guernsey Cattle Society, and of
the Australian Dairy Cattle Research
Association. In his day he was a sound
athlete. At the Uni. he got his football
and tennis blues, but these days he is
happier at a show ringside.
During his 36 years on the ocean wave
Captain C. B. Roche, now in Australian
waters in the P. and O. liner Mongolia, has
not had an unhappy experience. To use
his own words, he has had a “millpond
life” from the day in 1897 that he set
sail in the training-ship Conway until his
present command. He served in troop-
ships during the Boer and Great wars,
and escaped attack. One of his best
friends has had the opposite experience.
He has experienced such a unique suc-
cession of fierce gales that he is nick-
named “Hurricane Hal.” Captain Roche
has been in the P. and O. Company 29
years, and has relatives in three Aus-
tralian States.
Two of the notables who are keeping
out of the scramble for N. S. Wales Leg.
Council seats are R. G. D. Fitzgerald
(although placed on the Government’s
panel), who has had 34 years in the
State Parliament, and knight James Mur-
doch. Fitzgerald, seeing that he has a
legal business to attend to at Muswell-
brook, where he first put up his shingle
64 years ago, has been a fairly regular
attendant. Murdoch, although few
people suspect it, was once a union secre-
tary ; he was associated with the earliest
attempt to get the Shop Assistants’ Union
going, and it was largely through his
agitation that the first early-closing legis-
lation was introduced.
Henry Lawson was once asked by
a newspaper magnate (no patron of
poets or artists) where he gener-
ally spent his time when in the city.
“I’m generally to be found at the Eternal
Triangle,” replied the poet. “Where’s
that?” inquired the magnate. “The
Eternal Triangle,” explained Henry, “is
Angus and Robertson’s bookshop, Prior’s
room at The Bulletin and the ‘Worker’
office.”

The staff totals over 6150, and more than
70 p.c. of the co.’s merchandise now
comes from Australian sources, thanks to
the tariff and exchange. The mills at
Ballarat, which have not failed to pay
a div. since they were bought 18 years
ago, keep the co. supplied with fashion
cloth, tweeds, flannels, blankets, rugs,
underwear, etc., at manufacturers’ prices.
The Adelaide business (it used to be
James Marshall and Co., whose 200,000
ords. Myers bought in ’2B for 30s.
apiece) sent along its first contribution
(7 p.c.) to the pool in ’32, and is reported
to have made further progress since.
Also, good buying and forceful selling
methods, and the appearance of Coles
and Woolworths in Bourke-street, have
helped to bring more people to the big
emporium, while a tight hold has been
kept upon outgoings.
The improvement in the year’s net
earnings was £11,449, notwithstanding
the inevitable dislocation and hindrance
caused by reconstruction of the third and
final section of the co.’s Bourke-street
premises—the work, begun half-way
through the term, is now complete. After
paying the pref. and staff-partnership
divs. (together £64,205), there was enough
to show 8.9 p.c. on the £1,725,000 of
ord. capital as against 8.2, 5.1, 10.9, 14.6,
15.5 and 19.5 p.c. back to 1927. The
div. was kept at 6 p.c., leaving £50,019
to strengthen the tangible support (now
£297,054) for capital—goodwill (£250,000)
is not treated as an asset herein.
At the moment the stage is set for
better trading, provided the politicians do
nothing foolish. The rise in the price of
wool, adjustment of the tariff, and reduc-
tions in primage and taxation promise to
help spending and reduce outgoings a
trifle. Still competition will remain keen
and margins narrow.
The market prices the ords. at 30s. as
against 28s. 3d. a year ago and 16s. 6d.
12 months before that. The return at
30s. is 4 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. The
prefs. at 335. 3d. return 5.4 p.c. The
net tangible cover is £4 4s. sd. prefs.,
235. sd. ords.
There is nothing uncomfortable about

Sargents is one of the few stocks at
which the market continues to look
askance. That is partly because of the
trouble into which the co. has got itself
by a vigorous policy of property pur-
chase during the boom, and partly be-
cause slump and the quick growth of
competition have forced down prices and
sapped earnings, upon which interest
on the debt and high rentals continue to
press heavily—three branches were closed
during the last term owing to the rentals
demanded by lessors being regarded as
excessive.
More customers were served during
the last term, but prices had to be cut
to do it, and gross earnings (£171,987)
were £9576 lighter, making the slip
£133,557 over the last three years. Exes.
(£168,482, including provision for depre-
ciation ; no such allowance was made in
the previous term) were pulled back
£14,374, leaving the balance visibly £3505
on the right side. But if an unexplained
reduction of £21,083 in reserves is taken
into the reckoning, the year’s loss was
£17,578. This unexplained reduction
appears to have been due partly to pay-
ment of land tax (£3289) and largely to
loss in connection with freeholds and
leases.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures disclose it:
1924. 1929. 1932. 1933.
Capital .. £175,000 £272,050 £291,000 £291,000
Liabilities .. 82.G4G 371,093 209,029 242,441

etc. .. . 53,129 25,788 80,204 82,004
Shares in other
cos. 1,988 70,748 70.748
During the year the book value of free-
holds was reduced by £41,867 and lease-
holds by £4875; yet only £2262 was
added to liquids and £27,188 net knocked
off the debt, which consists of mort-
gages, £150,851 (down £32,312); over-
draft, £35,607 (down £654); sundry credi-
tors, £55,983 (up £5777). The excess of
liabilities over more or less liquids was
£29,450 less than at the previous balance
at £153,347. The position would look
a lot better if some of the freeholds
could be sold at a satisfactory figure and
the debt further reduced. The share-
holdings consist chiefly of 23,000 8 p.c.
prefs. and 37,000 ords. in Lucullus, Ltd.,
which took over the co.’s Melbourne
business, together with a mortgage of
£lOO,OOO, about three years ago (it has
ceased to contribute to the pool), 12,000
shares in City Property Estates, Sydney,
and the scrip in Sargents (Wholesale),
Ltd. Much also depends upon keen buy-
ing and alert supervision ; waste and re-
placements are often very expensive items
in this class of business.
At 10s. 9d. the pound shares would
yield 5.6 p.c. on the basis of a 3 p.c.
div., which would call for £8750 p.a. The
book value of the net tangible cover is
225. 2d.

What has happened here? Concerns like
this one, which enjoyed a lively turnover
and a reputation for shrewd buying,
promised to be early ©ut of the wood.
During the three years to the close of
accounts in 1932, extensions and addi-
tions were made to the Valley corner of
the co.’s premises, new departments were
added and more people came to the
store ; the co. bought the Brisbane stocks
of southern traders and others who with-
drew from the rag business in the
northern capital, and “beneficial arrange-
ments” were made with Foy and Gibson’s
Victorian mills. Also, a year ago, stock
figures were said to be adjusted so as to
“leave no possible doubt about any
adverse market fluctuations in the near
future.”
Of course, nobody can see very far
during these days of rapid changes in
trading conditions. After taking stocks
into account at £25,092 below the 1932
figure, gross earnings for the 12 months
to July 31 slipped £27,655:
1928. 193 Q. 1932. 1933.

Net profit.. £75,001 £65,000 £29,169 £1,947
After setting aside £1097 for taxation and
reserving £4850 for bad and doubtful
debts, a loss of £4OOO showed up—in
the previous year the profit was 5 p.c.
on capital as against 6.5, 11.8, 13.6, 13.6
and 14.3 p.c. back to 1927. Half-way
through the term things looked, good
enough to pay an interim 2 p.c.; thus
£15,000 of reserves was rubbed out.
Fierce competition, which means price
cutting, and cheap Japanese imports,
which affected the co.’s stocks of silk,
rayon and cotton piece-goods, etc., were
the trouble. The stocks concerned have
been either sold “regardless of cost” or
written down to present-day values, and,
if nothing unforeseen occurs, a reason-
able profit is anticipated at next balance.
Certainly the outlook generally has
brightened, but to what extent the ten-
dency of the shopping public to drift
back to Queen-street, where Finneys,
Coles, Woolworths and others have
become entrenched, will affect McWhir-
ters remains to be seen.
Over the last three years £124,000 net
has been added to the book value of
fixed assets, and the co. went outside for
the money. This and last year’s troubles
are reflected in the following table:
1930. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital.. £550,000 £550,000 £550,000 £550,000

ments, etc. 40,005 24,805 5,772 17,547
Th 6 more or less liquid surplus (£211,500,
including stock) slipped £24,536 over the
last 12 months.
The market prices the pound shares
at 11s. 7d. or thereabouts as against
17s. 6d. a‘year ago. At 11s. 7d. the
return would be 5.2 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div.
basis. The cover is 245. in net tangibles.

The board has not yet definitely made
up its mind what the future is likely to
hold for the business. When it does the
assets are to be revalued and the capital
account reconstructed. There are 150,000
8 p.c. cum. prefs. and 375,000 ords. The
public took the prefs. in 1924, mainly to
pay off the debt on Her Majesty’s
Theatre block, Sydney. Since then die
talkies, broadcasting, slump and taxation
have altered the outlook completely. The
next table shows how severely earnings
have suffered over the last half-dozen
years:—

*Loss.
Certainly the tide has turned. Still, last
year’s profit was little more than one-
third of a full year’s pref. requirements,
after allowing for the statutory cut, and
the div. had fallen three years into
arrears when the books closed.
However, it is plain that the market,
which has lengthened its bid for the scrip
from 10s. to 19s. over the last 12 months,
anticipates that earnings will presently
recover sufficiently to begin payments to
the prefs., and it may not be disappointed.
Takings are expected to further improve
(much, of course, will depend upon
suitable attractions), and cuts in taxa-
tion will give the co. a little relief.
The board has leased Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney, to Woolworths, bought
a small freehold next door and sold the
co.’s interests in the Theatre Royal, Mel-
bourne.
Nevertheless, “transfer of several
amounts from sundry debtors’ accounts
to freehold property accounts” suggests
that some freeholds in N. S. Wales have
fallen into the co.’s hands again. Here
is as much as balance-sheet figures tell:

During the year £184,619 was added to
the book value of freeholds, etc., debtors’
balances were reduced by £157,810, and
£22,041 was added to the debt, appar-
ently in connection with the purchase of
the Sydney freehold already referred to.
The outside debt exceeded more or less
liquids, excluding shares in other cos.,
by £367,726, or £180,024 more than at
the previous balance. The shareholdings
consist chiefly of scrip in Hoyt’s, which
took over J.C.W.’s picture interests about
eight years ago.

This was one of the most remarkable
industrial floats in the history of Aus-
tralian company finance. For 200,000 £1
shares no less than £2,290,000 was
offered ; that was in 1929, and the paper,
then paid to 35., soon went to 9s. in the
market. The success of the parent co.
in Sydney and the quick development of
an offshoot in Brisbane were responsible
for the rush. But different problems had
to be faced in Melbourne, where strong
competition was well entrenched. Also
the weather was unkind, and the boom
burst, leaving the co. with a p. and 1.
debit of £27,145 and £51,650 of other
intangibles at June 30, 1932. Though it
had then turned the corner, earnings pro-
mised to be very moderate, which meant
that plant was not likely to be worth
the figure at which it appeared.
To lighten the charge for depreciation
and clear the way for the payment of
divs., £82,824 was lopped off paid capi-
tal, reducing it to £122,504 in 12s. shares,
of which 94,500 are fully paid and the
balance paid to 4s. 9d. The cut, together
with £30,606 from reserve for deprecia-
tion, etc. (now £10,795), enabled the p.
and 1. debit to be rubbed out, goodwill
and rights to be reduced by £11,650, leav-
ing these intangibles at £40,000, and
£69,650 to be knocked off the book value
of plant and £4986 off freeholds.
After adding £7685 net to the reserve
for depreciation, etc., as against £13,052
in the previous term, net earnings for
the 12 months to June 30 were £4773
better at £8668, equal to 7.1 p.c. on the
£122,504 of capital, and shareholders got
6 p.c., their first div., worth 3.6 p.c. on
capital as it stood before the writing
down.
The book adjustments and the com-
fortable state of the finances are reflected
in this comparison of balance-sheet
figures:
1930. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital. . £174,189 £204,463 £204,708 £122,504

Cash, etc. . . 27 193 1,323 15,244
The year’s improvement in the more or
less liquid surplus (£18,879) was £12,385.
On the market the contribs., which
sold as low as 6d. each in 1931, have
risen from ss. to Bs. 9d. over the last
four months. The return at Bs. 9d. is
3.3 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. Thus the
investor who looks for a shade under
5 p.c. on his money counts on a 9 p.c.
distribution. The net tangible cover is
17s. 9d. per pound of paid capital, mostly
plant, worth what it can earn.
East African Coffee Plantations
It has been a disappointing venture.
The co., formed in 1928, is in the same
stable as Victoria Nyanza Sugar, which
was also promoted by the late George R.
Mayers. The early success of the sugar
business sent the public rushing for this
co.’s scrip (paid capital was £150,000,
including £50,000 in paids taken by the
vendor), which sold as high as 435. on
the market. But before the co. could get
on to its feet slump changed the whole
outlook, and shareholders, who have
already lost half their capital, are now
being asked for a bit more in order to
protect the other half.
The co. is just emerging from
the development stage. It holds some
8500 acres, mostly on a 99-year lease, in
the Nandi and Kiambu districts, East
Africa. The exact area under coffee is
not mentioned, but 1856 acres were
pruned during the 12 months to the
end of August, 1932. The trees are
not revenue producers until three years
old, and do not come into full bearing
until their sixth year. Because of this,
the cost of handling a small crop (28.3
tons as against 11\ tons for the previous
year ; the shrinkage was due to heavy
pruning), and the continued fall in prices
(sales averaged £7O os. 6d. a ton, or
£5 ss. 6d. less than the previous year’s),
a trading loss of £3456 showed up. That
was after charging £7631 net to develop-
ment, raising expenditure on this account
to £60,919. The p. and 1. debit was £3488,
and preliminary exes, figured at £3260.
Moreover, the co. is hamstrung by lack
of working capital:
1928. 1930. 1931. 1932.

AN INCOME
when they grow up
MANY men are giving themselves the comfort and
satisfaction of taking out A.M.P. policies for
the benefit of their children when they grow
up. They have found how little they have to invest
to assure to their children a good round sum at any age
they choose; a sum to be invested so that an income
may be provided.
There are many ways of providing for children. Take a
the method of a certain clergyman. He was 27 years
old and his income was small, but he found that by
investing £lO a year in an A.M.P. policy (Table J) he
could guarantee that his daughter, then three years old,
would receive £2OO when she was 21. If he died before
she was 21, she would get the money immediately. He
didn’t die. Last month the 21st birthday came along
and the girl got her £2OO, plus £7O bonuses. “It is a
mighty useful sum for a girl to have,” said the Clergy-
man, “and I never missed that £lO a year.”
Send for free booklets about policies for children.
Better still, ask the nearest A.M.P. representative to
explain them.

while prices were high, and the equip-
ment are not now worth their book value.
To knock £37,071 off the land and build-
ings item, £8079 off plant, £22,434 off the
development account and wipe out the
p. and 1. debit and preliminary exes, half
the capital has been jettisoned, reducing
the figure to £75,000 in 10s. shares.
To provide more working capital and
help lighten the overdraft (£15,141 at the
close of accounts, but now approximately
£21,000) 30,000 new 10s. shares are
offered. The other two large creditors,
the estate of George R. Mayers
(£12,228) and Victoria Nyanza (£10,270),
have agreed to wait for their money
(how long is not stated) provided
£BOOO of fresh working capital is
introduced into the business. Subject to
this, the co. appears to have a very good
fighting chance. The crop for the nine
months to the end of May last was
approximately 127 tons ; nature permit-
ting, it is expected to reach 326 tons in
1934. Ottawa has given the co.’s pro-
duct a £9 6s. Bd. per ton on
the British market, where it is said to
sell freely in competition with the
Brazilian article, and prices are steadier
than they were.

A geophysical survey suggested exten-
sion of the shear zones, and No. 14 bore
has disclosed a width of 30ft. of payable
stone beyond the limits of the present
workings. Lateral exploration and ex-
tensions in depth are therefore expected
to add considerably to the measured ore
reserves. Allowing for dilution in min-
ing, etc., the milling grade is put at 565.

and with costs at 325. 6d. a ton, there
would thus be a working profit of ap-
proximately £350,000 from the 300,000
tons now measured up. On the board
are Colin Fraser, M. L. Baillieu, W. S,
Robinson, Lindesay Clark, Alex. Stewart
and H. E. Vail.

The Mt. Peter goldfield, near Cairns
(N.Q.), continues to produce small
parcels of high-grade ore. But the stone
has to go to Chillagoe, and under these
conditions no field can prosper as it
should. The Talisman Amalgamated has
steadily produced good ore for the past
three years ; a recent 15 tons sent to the
distant smelters averaged 3oz. fine gold.
It is safe to say that over the same period
50 tons of not less than 15dwt. grade
could have been crushed locally. But
Mt. Peter has not been big enough to
attract a strong financial co.*; still, be-
cause the shows were held by small un-
organised parties, including a number of
old miners from elsewhere, it was a field
that could and should have been nursed
and supplied with practical assistance
towards a satisfactory solution of the
local milling problem. Amongst other
things, this would have helped to reduce
local unemployment.
* * * *
Gold-mining on the famous old
Charters Towers field hasn’t been able
to emerge from the doldrums, despite the
lure of high prices. Much is spent from
relief funds, and occasionally a small
but good parcel is obtained. Such was
the 750 z. recently obtained by Campbell
and Pugh from 18 tons of stone on
Tower Hill. It involved a lot of dead-
work ; the leader was but 3in. thick and
the depth 80ft. The development of the
Black Jack and New Queen cross reefs
is well under way. Both reefs paid divi-
dends in the past, and the two cos. which
have the job in hand are financial enough
to prospect ore-bodies below the last
faces worked.
* * * *
Gold Mines of Australia has definitely
decided to make Gympie the place of
its next operations in Queensland. C.
G. Gibson has just finished an inspec-
tion of the co.’s areas there. Including
some recently acquired by negotiation,
these run into several hundred acres.
Gibson told the Gympieites that “the co.
is not there for fun,” and otherwise in-
dicated that he likes the prospects.
* * * *
The last 10 tons crushed at the Black
Cat, Batavia River goldfield, Cape York
Peninsula, yielded 183 oz. Also, the
Double Chance and New Year’s Gift con-
tinue to be profitable producers, crush-
ings averaging about ; the Golden
Casket, which has yielded over IOOOoz. to
date, is still on payable ore, and the
wash in the Hidden Treasure has re-
turned an average of 38dwt. per ton.
Over the last six months the field has
yielded about 860 fine ounces of gold ;
it is 78 miles from Coen and 123 miles
from Port Stewart, and is served by
motor-lorries.
* * * *
During August and September the
Palmer River Gold Co. (N.Q.) got 990 z.
of gold, valued at £724, from 62,200 c.y.,
compared with 1150 z., valued at £BO7,
from 65,800 c.y. in June and July. Better
gravel formations are now being worked,
and higher returns are expected.
* * * *
Australian Mining Trust has sur-
rendered its lease at Marquis Hill (N.Q.);
prospecting and sampling disclosed a
gold content of only about 2dwt. per
ton.
* * * *
It is difficult to say what the future
holds for Bulolo Gold Deposits. On
three of its leases the overburden has
reduced the average value of the small
quantity of wash available to about 6d.
a yard. That is not good enough to war-
rant installation of a sluicing plant. Also,
the “Wild Cat” would not be surprised to
hear that the co.’s dredging claim is not
worth working either. Certainly some
of the Bulolo flats below Koranga Creek
are rich enough, but the nature, depth
and value of the banks and river bed
above that point have yet to be proved.

Yilgarn G.M. has been launched in
Melbourne with a capital of £25,000 in ssi.
shares to prospect a property 30 miles
from Southern Cross (W.A.). The terms
are £lOOO down, plus another £2500 and
20,000 paids if the option is exercised in
three months. The lode is composed
largely of hornblende schist, with quartz
distributed irregularly throughout. It
widens from 2ft. on the surface to 9ft.
on the 180 ft. (bottom) level, which is
to be unwatered and sampled ; the shaft
is to be sunk a further 115 ft.

Two rich but shallow gold finds, one
at Mulline and the other at Burbanks,
have attracted attention in Westralia.
The one at Mulline, from which nearly
2000 oz. has been extracted to date, is
close to the old Lady Gladys, out of
which three Melbourne speculators took
over £20,000 apiece. Other claimholders
in the vicinity also did well for a time.
The Burbanks discovery is a mile or two
from the Londonderry, where 43000 z.
was taken from a hole sft. by 4ft. and
3ft. deep in 1894. It is also about the
same distance from the Burbanks mine,
which produced a lot of gold before
going wrong at depth.

C. M. Harris, whose opinion is well
respected in mining circles in Australia,
has reported favorably (by wire) on the
Callion, Davyhurst (W.A.), over which
the Enterprise Co. has an option. Where
sampled at the 120 ft. and 200 ft. levels
the shoot assayed from Bdwt. to 9dwt.
over a width of 3£ft. and a length of
100 ft.; in a couple of winzes the assay
was lldwt. to 13dwt. Harris says no-
thing about prospects at depth.

London interests are endeavoring to
resurrect the old White Hope (W.A.),
which figured prominently in the Hamp-
ton Plains boom of 1920. It was worked
first by an Adelaide co., and afterwards
by a local syndicate. It closed down
after about 30,000 tons, averaging half
an ounce, was extracted from shallow
workings. Recent boring is declared to
have given satisfactory results at depth.

Duplication of Boulder Perseverance’s
bromo-cyanide plant is progressing satis-
factorily. When completed, it will have
a capacity between 14,000 and 15,000
tons per month, and will handle the
crudes from North Kalgurli. Until next
May the North is under contract to
treat its stone at South Kalgurli’s mill.
If Perseverance’s plant is completed be-
fore then, North will send feed to both
mills.

Backed by Malayan tin speculators
who are anxious to become interested in
gold, G. W. Osborne has secured a wad
of reserve shares in the New Venture
Co., formed in Perth some time ago to
work derelicts at Coolgardie and else-
where in Westralia. With gold around
£8 an ounce (Australian currency) it is
claimed that these shows can be turned
to profitable account. Osborne has also
taken options over some auriferous areas
on the Pilbara field.
* * * *
One of the latest of the old shows to
be manned again is the North Star at
Malcolm (W.A.). It flourished under
the control of the late G. W. Hall, but
after about 20,0000 z. had been ex-
tracted, prospects dimmed, and . the
operating co., a London concern, gave
up. Others tried it before the rise in
the price of gold and lost.
* * * *
Granites Development, which has an
option over the North Wiluna (W.A.),
has more than 100 tons of 15dwt. ore at
grass. When another 200 tons has been
raised, the lot is to be crushed at the
local battery. It is quite probable that
the option will be exercised. The co.
has £2OOO in hand.

The Ida H. Syndicate, which is re-
treating the sands on the old Ida H. in

SHADOW SHOWS.
Our ballyhoo critics have lavished so
many superlatives on bad English films
that when a fairly good one comes along
and the superlatives are trotted out again
readers feel doubtful. This apropos
“Loyalties” at the Lyceum. Galsworthy
may not have been one of the elect —as
J. C. Squire wrote last month, his “best
book, ‘The Man of Property,’ will within
20 years have gone the way of Henry
Mackenzie’s ‘The Man of Feeling’ ” —but
he was an astute critic of a society which
he knew well.
In “Loyalties” he presents a Jew (Basil
Rathbone), rich, suave, socially ambi-
tious, overdressed, addicted to jewellery.
A penniless army officer (Miles Mander)
robs him at a country house. The Jew
is an alien in class and race. It is under-
standable that the other guests should
range themselves against him in his fight
for his money. But he battles on, and
the audience sympathises. The court
interlude has real tension ; and the final
crash is highly dramatic.
Basil Rathbone —sleek, mercenary,
vulgar, yet with touches of nobility—must
be very like the Jew Galsworthy envis-
aged. Miles Mander is sound, particu-
larly towards the end, and Joan Wynd-
ham is convincing as his loyal wife.
“Three Men in a Boat” is a modern-
ised version of Jerome K. Jerome’s nine-
teenth-century best-seller. It is fairly
funny, and there are some picturesque
shots of the Thames.
* * *
There is an insidious old-world charm
about “A Successful Calamity” at the
State. The basic idea goes one (or, to be
exact, four) better than a venerable melo-
drama convention. Not only does the
aged retainer hand his life’s savings to
George Arliss in the supposed hour of
trial, but the master’s son, daughter,
wife and wife’s gigolo prove to have
equally faithful hearts.
The gigolo is a pleasing change ; he
is the first in the history of the screen
who isn’t shown up at the end as a cur
and scoundrel. Another innovation is
the exclusion of the famished screen kiss,
introduced originally by Greta Garbo in
the mid-silent era. Directors have been
featuring it ever since, though it has long
been as much a weariness to the eye as
flappers in backless-frontless bathing cos-
tumes. Can it be that we are in for a
revival of the simple old maudlinity
plays of a century ago? This show, “The
Good Companions” and “The Squat-
ter’s Daughter” suggest it.
None of the key-events could have
happened. Such a family wouldn’t have
dreamt of leaving the pathetic old home-
lover whorq Arliss portrays to spend his
evening in loneliness after a year’s
absence on the nation’s business in
Europe. Mary Astor wouldn’t have ren-
dered the poor old boy’s den uninhabit-
able by modernising it. But without these
and other incredibilities there would be
no action, and no laughs.
The charm is largely due to the art of
that accomplished old fascinator Arliss.
How admirably he uses his voice and
articulates his words, and how plausible
his easy reticence makes the fairy story
seem in places! He remains an Eng-
lishman, a Dickens character, in a
family of modern Americans, as different
in class and culture as their methods of
pronouncing the word “ruined.” The
Dickensian, not to say Richardsonian,
note adds to the charm. Cold shivers
don’t run down the spine when the
characters utter their old-fashioned whim-
sies and banalities about the compensa-
tions of poverty, because the thing is
essentially a period piece.
“She Had to Say ‘Yes’ ” also recalls
a vanished age. Loretta Young is a
modern Clarissa. Two Surfaces (Regis
Toomey and Lyle Talbot) try to encom-
pass her destruction. She foils them, but
they so undermine the fortress of her in-
tegrity that she is persuaded to black-
mail another of her would-be seducers.
This revolts Talbot, and impels him to
drive her furiously to an empty palace
in the country, where she is robbed of
that without which a girl were better in
her tomb. Then Talbot marries her.
Moral: Live a Clarissa in the U.S.A. if
you want to die a Pamela. It is played
at a terrific pace. Miss Young’s ward-
robe is interesting as showing what can
be done in America on a typist’s salary.
* * *
The trouble starts in “Another Lan-
guage,” at the Regent, as soon as Robert
Montgomery returns from the honey-
moon with Helen Hayes. Helen can’t
get on with Louise Closser Hale, Bob’s
mother, or with his low-brow brothers
and their imbecile wives, and Bob, of
course, is drawn both ways. John Beal,
son of one of Bob’s brothers, complicates
matters by siding with the outcast. The
young people make a fresh start, but the
fami^ 1 / continue to hate Helen and de-
spise Beal, so prospects are not exhilarat-
ing.
Helen Hayes is perhaps the best of a
good cast. Most of the principals ap-
peared in the stage version.
“Professional Sweetheart” is Ginger
Rogers, a broadcasting “Purity Girl.”
There are no more worlds for her to con-
quer, but she isn’t satisfied. She yearns
for a contract which will allow her to
smoke, drink and have a boy friend. She
gets him, and at the same time retains
her vast public’s faith.

“Double Harness,” at Melb. Capitol,
is the old one about the pure maiden who
sets out to save her lover’s soul and in-
cidentally the shipping line of which he
is the president. Ann Harding tricks Wil-
liam Powell into matrimony by getting
her father to catch them in his flat.
When he discovers the trick he returns
to an earlier love, a bad, bad girl. Owing
to his fondness for girl and his distaste
for hard work, Mr. Powell’s shipping
line is on a lee shore, leaking badly, its
mainmast has gone by the board, the
crew refuses to man the pumps and the
breakers can be plainly heard. Miss
Harding invites the Postmaster-General to
dinner, and one look into her eyes is
enough—he hands William the mail con-
tract on behalf of Uncle Sam as if it
SYDNEY FLICKERS.

were a box of chocolates he had bought
at the corner store. The husband is so
overwhelmed by this demonstration of
his wife’s business capacity that he gives
the bad girl the air and takes to a life
of hard work and marital fidelity.
There is nothing new under the sun
or under the Kleig lights, for that matter.
The man who wrote “Double Harness”
may never have heard of “Der Ring des
Nibelungen,” but he has merely stated
old Wagner’s theme in modern terms. It
is the sort of job Hollywood does
supremely well. The sentimental story
is told in brightly cynical terms, and the
setting is so lavish as to make even the
Capitol look drab and the standard of
living of an Australian millionaire no
better than heartbreaking poverty. The
acting is excellent.

One of those Fine Old German Brewers
who, for the duration of prohibition,
have been living in retirement in the U.S. A.,
knowing naught of gangsters, boot-
leggers and hijackers, provides the poor-
old-popper interest in “Song of the
Eagle” at the Capitol. Jean Hersholt
plays the part. Charles Bickford doesn’t
care how many rounds of machine-gun
ammunition his henchmen bury in the
bodies of Hersholt’s serfs so long as he
can become lord of the brewery. Louise
Dresser, as the brewer’s wife, bumps
Bickford off with a six-shooter. There is
one spark of good drama in the fan-
tasia. A melancholy individual (George
E. Stone) has friends on both sides. He
delivers a warning to the legitimate
brewing interest, and afterwards wanders
down a long corridor. Something very
nearly as fine as Hamlet’s soliloquy is
portrayed in facial expression before the
poor chap casts an agonised upward
glance at the sign marked “exit” and is
sent to his eternal reward.
To appreciate “Elmer the Great” it is
necessary to be en rapport not only with
the technique of Joe E. Brown (Elmer)
but with the ins and outs of baseball.
Brown and his froglike mouth are always
associated with parts in which an egotis-
tical dub makes good as a sportsman.
An odd feature of the game in which
Elmer retrieves his reputation is that it
is conducted in a downpour of rain.
Sundry Shows
Second item in the Broadcasting Com-
mission’s season of opera was “La
Tosca,” which went very well indeed—
better than it did on the stage the last
time it was seen in Sydney, because
attention was not distracted from Puc-
cini’s music by the spectacle of a burly
prima donna stabbing a small Scarpia
with a table-knife. Madame Goossens-
Viceroy was Tosca, Lionello Cecil’s sweet
tenor voiced the emotions of Mario, and
Signor Izal equipped the treacherous
chief of police with sufficiently sinister
notes. Orchestra, under Wando Aldro-
vandi, was adequate, and the chorus,
which has little to do in this opera, sang
pleasingly.

In Shaw’s “The Apple Cart,” given its
Australian premiere at Melb. Garrick
last week, Gregan McMahon not only
understood King Magnus but fully sym-
pathised with his character. Throughout
the piece McMahon never raised his
voice above a conversational undertone,
but the effect was not monotonous. This
was actor-magic of a high order, and a
packed house paid a tribute of rapt in-
terest.
In the play England is ostensibly
ruled by a Labor Cabinet which in-
dulges in red shirts, green ties and the
republican pastime of being rude to the
hereditary monarch. To compensate for
the kicks it receives from the people
and its real masters it kicks King Mag-
nus. The King receives these attentions
with smiling nonchalance, while he reveals
that the real rulers of England are neither
the Cabinet nor himself, but the share-
holders of Breakages, Ltd., a firm which
makes its profits out of the wear and
tear on national equipment and buys up
and suppresses all such inventions as
stainless steel, unsmashable glass and
imperishable bronze. Magnus has been
embarrassing Cabinet by making speeches,
and Cabinet demands from him a vow
of silence. He counters the ultimatum
by announcing that he will abdi-
cate and contest a Parliamentary seat for
the constituency of Windsor.
Add to this piece of topsy-turvydom
the scene where the American ambassa-
dor announces, to the horror of Magnus,
that the U.S.A. has decided to re-enter
the British Commonwealth of Nations
and you have Shaw at his brightest.
Also there’s an interlude, in which
Magnus calls on his mistress Orinthia,
seemingly thrown in because the Irish
playwright wanted to underline views
on the grand passion previously more or
less explained by the publication of his
queer correspondence with a famous
actress. Magnus’s idea is to keep Orinthia
in a sort of purely intellectual harem.
It is cruel to the lady, but apparently
satisfactory to her lover, whose affairs of
State are his prime interest. When she
protests there is a rough and tumble, and
the pair are rolling on the floor when a
secretary enters. Mixed rolling on floors
seems to be the latest British indoor
pastime—see Noel Coward’s “Private
Lives” and other recent opuses. But
that’s by the way.
The McMahon presentation was blessed
with intelligence. The Prime Minister of
Jos. Ambler was an inspired piece of
casting, and George Cockerill was
grotesquely real as a demagogue. Kath-
leen Howell and Nancy Ford were two
excellent stateswomen, and as Orinthia
the physically staggering Coral Brown
added to a faultless face and figure a
sense of drama.

Efftee Thring’s new production at the
Garrick, Melbourne, Christa Winsloe’s
“Children in Uniform,” is a German
counterpart of “Young Woodley” ; the
setting is a school where the children
of Prussian officers are educated to be
the drill sergeants and mothers of a fresh
brood dedicated to the restoration
of the gore and glory of the Empire.
This ideal demands the ruthless repres-
sion of most of the natural instincts of
both teachers and pupils. The repressed
instincts express themselves in the girls
pouring out their starved emotions in the
direction of the most human of their
mentors, Fraulein von Bernberg (Coral
Brown). The competition for her affec-
tion is won by Manuela (Phyllis Baker),
an orphan. Too much fruit-cup loosens
her tongue. She is condemned to soli-
tary confinement and throws herself out
of a window.
The solid German touch of the author
assists in the creation of the atmosphere
of constraint whose only breath of
Heaven is the gaiety and irreverence of
the girls when not under observation.
There is this curious result of the sys-
tem —it bands all the victims together in
common cause against their oppressors.
The production on Saturday was a
triumph for Gregan McMahon and
the Efftee Players. The average child-
actor on the stage is an unmitigated
horror, and there are 37 characters in
this play, all females and most of them
children. Some of the “children” were
no doubt older than their parts, but there
was nothing to choose between the lot
of them in point of girlish spontaneity,
while some of their elders were too con-
ventionally elocutionary. Phyllis Baker
gave an astonishingly poignant study of
Manuela, whose unspoiled instincts,
meeting the impassable barrier of a
philosophy of life that might have been
devised by homicidal lunatics, express
themselves in hysteria and find escape in
self-destruction. Joan Lang was unique
as Use, the less sensitive type, who sur-
vives the system by making fun of it.
This lady is a Thring find of importance,
and should have a film career before her.
Headmistress Nancy Ford was a
trenchant symbol for Blood and Iron
stated in the feminine gender. As Frau-
lein von Bernberg, the mistress who
struggles to be human in a machine
environment, Coral Brown showed that
she has the intelligent versatility of the
genuine actress. The appropriate costum-
ing and the excellent staging—all eccle-
siastical grey stone —set a new standard
for Melbourne, amateur and professional.

“The Laugh Parade” is Frank Neil’s
show at Melb. Palace this week. Mo and
his Merry Monarchs continue to rule
over a republic of mirth at the Tivoli.
The fact that the wreckers will soon
move into the Royal is not being allowed
to cloud the closing nights of “Music
in the Air,” while “Road House” is still
gibbering blithely on its way at the
King’s. “Rope” is being uncoiled nightly
at the Princess by Frank Harvey and
co. According to an advt., Theo Shall
has pushed the perambulator of “Baby
Mine” as far as the Palais, St. Kilda,
and shouts of laughter are expected to
mingle with the murmur of the sad sea
waves as from the 27th.

The Repertory Theatre of Adelaide has
again awarded its short-play prize (for
members only) to a woman, Joan Kin-
mont, a school-teacher. The judges, Ethel-
wyn Robin, Talbot Smith and Thomas
Nave, report that some good entries
which this year, by some misunderstand-
ing, came in from other States are
barred by the regulations ; but they sug-
gest playing Mrs. Penleigh Boyd (Vic-
toria) and G. L. Dann (Queensland)
some time soon. The same judges are
now at work on the long-play £2O-prize
competition, which is all-Australian. As
there are about 60 entries, they will need
time.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Boigu”: It was a proud day for the
missionary when he converted and bap-,
tised our official magician and rain-
maker. Some months later, when a dry
spell was causing some anxiety, it
occurred to me to ask the converted one
if he was still able to make rain. He
was indignant. The missionary had for-
bidden him to manufacture downpours
in future, and had told him that if he
“Look ’ere, sport, you cut out tha’ t — hie — tacking. F’r two pinsh I’d report
y’ to th’ shtewards.”
desired relief from drought he must pray
for it. I left him, saying that if he
brought about a decent fall within a few
days it would be worth his while. Sure
enough the rain came, and a day or two
after I found him sitting under the house
waiting for his fee. “Tell me,” I asked,
looking the convert in his heathen eye,
“did you make that rain New Guinea
fashion or did you pray for it?” He
rolled the eye to see if anyone was listen-
ing. “Taubada,” he said, “I did make it
New Guinea fashion. But,” he went on,
as he dropped my contribution in his
sling-bag, “I told the Taparora [mis-
sionary] I prayed for it. He has given
me tobacco.”
* * * *
“O. W. Waireki”: When Jones added
postal duties to his job as proprietor of a
ML. country store he did a-surprisingly
big trade in postal-notes—surprising
because his predecessor in the district
had said there was scarcely any demand
for ’em. Jones was waiting for the
P.M.G. to express his joy when a Maori
customer shattered the bright dream.
“This te first no-fraud P.O. I ever see,”
beamed Henare, as he tucked away a six-
bob p.n. “In Napier, te six-shirring post-
ing note costs six an’ tuppence ; in Hast-
ings, te same ; but here you just charge
six shirrings, an’ no humpug.” P.n. sales
are now normal. An out-of-pocket
official no longer overlooks poundage.
* * * *
“Hory”: Old Tom had the bad habit
of leaving his trousers off. This was all
right when he was 40 miles from a pub
and civilisation, as he was 360 days in
the year, but U was a bit awkward the
other five days*. One morning at Christ-
mastime old Tom wandered into a
crowded bar with spare hairy shanks pro-
truding indecently from his long shirt.
The lady behind was indignant. “You
get outer here!” she shouted, “and don't
come in again till ye can bring yer
trousers with ye!” Old Tom gave her
a look of mild surprise and wandered
meekly out. In two minutes he was back,
trousers in hand. “Here y’are, Miss,” he
said, pushing them across the bar ; “ye’ll
find I gotter bit o’ money there. I wasn’t
thinkin’ of doing yer out of anything.”
*** # *
“Tyke”: The perennial barge about
Alsatians reminds me that European ex-
changes are talking of a Berlin dog-
trainer who is educating his animals—
Alsatians, of course, they being, appar-
ently, the only intelligent breed at pre-
sent in the news—by making them watch
a special barkie film depicting the tricks
he wants them to do. One report says
that the dogs are rather bored when they
see their fellow-performers on the film,
but “sit with eager eyes and pricked ears
when the educational part begins,” which
suggests they are genuine actors in addi-
tion to being Alsatians.

“Carnivore”: If his size corresponded
to his ferocity our pouched rat would
have all the tigers in India Persian kittens
by comparison. A specimen has recently
been received at Brisbane Museum,
where, with its family of five, it is living
well on pigeons. About the size of the
ordinary Norway rat, this chap, one of
the dasyures, like the Tasmanian Devil,
whose unpleasant disposition he shares,
boasts a brushy tip at the end of a long
bald tail. Armed with jaws full of long
and sharp teeth, the beast is more than
a match for anything approaching its
own size, and is always willing to have a
go at anything or anyone—one down,
t’other come on. It is something of a
freak also, in that it often has a larger
family than its feeding apparatus can
provide for, a bloomer old Mother
Nature does not often make.

“Corselet”: Diving accidents aren’t
made a song about in northern waters,
but one slightly out of the common
occurred outside Cairns recently. A
“Dad, will I look like you when I grow up?"
“S’pose you will, boy.”
“Well, I won’t have to grow up for a long while yet, will I?”
Japanese named Takeuchi went down in
nine fathoms, and at once signalled to
be pulled up. The native crew had a
look at him through the glass when he
came up, and concluded he was para-
lysed. They therefore lowered him away
at once to five fathoms for the “staging”
process. A native boy who went down
to have a look at the patient came back
with the opinion that he was “finish.”
So he was, but it was by drowning and
not paralysis, his airpipe having burst
the first time without the crew having
noticed it.
* * * *
“Spoof”: To those like myself, who
have travelled in many lands and been
lying about them ever since, there is in-
terest in the aspirations of Mdlle. de
Guerville, who recently came to Aus-
tralia, complete with movie camera, to
investigate the culture and characteris-
tics of the Centralian aborigines. What
with Lasseter’s last ride, the camel ex-
pedition to find him, the ride in motor-
lorries to find the camels and an aero-
plane joyride or two to locate the lot
of them, the lady is like to find the noble
savage of our desert heart a trifle
sophisticated. She thinks it would be
romantic to come in touch with “the
man who went out with a boom-
erang and came back with a coyote
or a bear over his shoulder for the
woman of his affection.” I can assert
that in that part of the world it would
be more than romantic —it would be
miraculous.
* * * *
“Herpeton”: One unexpected result of
the clearing of prickly-pear country in
Queensland is the decline and fall of the
snake population, which was very abun-
dant and flourishing in bad pear areas.
So marked has this been that E. A.
Eades, who used to visit an area regu-
larly to collect his weekly 100 death
adders for the C.5.1.R., has been
compelled to change his hunting grounds
for lack of game. Of course, the usual
controversy has been raging. The bush
school of experts insists that the serpent
has learned to eat the tiny Cactoblastis
caterpillar which infests the pear and is
dying of the unaccustomed diet. The
official view is that the clearing off of
the pear has deprived the adders of
shelter and laid them and their tender
nestlings open to the attacks of their
enemies, among whom may be numbered
the emu, which is very partial to a batch
of young snake.
* * * *
“Ex-Solomon”: A phenomenon better
understood by the average policeman or
police magistrate than by the average
Judge and jury is the sort of perjury
that arises from a diseased craving for
notoriety. Crimes of a sensational sort
that are given wide newspaper publicity
not infrequently bring forward spurious
confessions. As soon as corroborative
evidence for these self-accusations is
sought the case usually crumples under
an impregnable alibi or is rejected be-
cause the thing simply couldn’t have hap
pened as the confessor described the
business. More dangerous is the men-
tally-unstable witness who has avidly
read all the reported details of the crime,
and who volunteers testimony which
checks up so well, with the circumstances
that the police cannot reject the evi-
dence, though they suspect it to be un-
reliable. I have recollections of a mur-
der case—unpleasant, because I attended
the execution with a strong con-
viction that it was a miscarriage of jus-
tice. The case went to a third trial, with
two changes of venue, and at the final
hearing, more than a year after the com-
mission of the crime, an old woman
came forward with eye-witness testi-
mony. She related how she had stood
in a dark street on a pouring wet night,
a hundred yards away from the old
shed where the body was found, and had
seen the accused —a very stupid sea-
faring man who was so drunk that night
that he could give no coherent account
of his movements —stamp the victim to
death. Her testimony was, to me and
to many others in the court, incredible ;
counsel for the defence shot holes
through it in cross-examination and in
his address to the jury. The J udge gave
the defence’s criticism full weight in his
summing up. But the photographic pic-
ture that old woman gave, coming pat
upon various items of circumstantial
evidence detailed in previous trials,
turned the scale, and the verdict was
“guilty.”
* * * *
“Strict Veg.”: The latest advance in
civilisation is slippers with electric bulbs
in them which light up when the owner
inserts her feet, thus enabling her to find
her way to the bath without falling over
the cat. I have been using a similar
device for years, and it has the merit
of being cheaper, anybody being able
to use it without infringing a manufac-
turer’s patent rights. I employ bits of
the luminous fungus, a supply of which
can be obtained almost anywhere in the
Australian coastal bush. By placing
pieces in strategic spots about the house
one can find one’s way about on the
darkest night. A cubic inch carried in
the pocket is useful for ascertaining the
time when out for a walk, and a larger
bit is an adequate inspection lamp for
motor-cars. Fresh stock lasts three or
four days, and the only objection to its
use is that after a day or two it smells
like a dead horse. I am at present en-
deavoring to produce a new breed with-
out this disability by crossing the fungus
with violets.
* * * *
“Frigid”: Although no true yew-trees
are found south of the Equator, four
close relatives live in Queensland and
form an interesting group. One variety,
Podocarpus dispermus, was not placed
botanically until Kajewski discovered
complete flowering and fruiting plants
on the Atherton Tableland. This variety
has two peculiar green seeds on a red
fleshy growth, very much like a hand in
appearance. Other varieties have only
one seed. It doesn’t grow to a great
height, and hasn’t the spreading habit of
the common yew (Taxus baccata ).
ROUGH ON OUR WINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“During the height of the bodyline controversy, the
consumption of Australian wines in England sustained
a marked falling-off.”
You batsmen and bowlers,
And Board-of-Controllcrs,
You cablegram-senders,
Productive of snorts,
Observe how your jangles
And pitiful wrangles
React on our vendors
Of sherries and ports.
These bodyline blathers,
One readily gathers,
Were hotly resented
From Thames-side to Tyne;
Now comes the disclosure
And damning exposure:
They even prevented
The sale of our wine.
At the peak of the worry
No blokes in a Surrey
Or Nottingham bar would
Absorb without spleen
The tiddley that braces,
Compounded in places
That vilified Larwood
Or railed at Jardine.
They mused on who made it,
Tis like, and surveyed it
With unspoken query 01
Inimical glance.
While the cricket heads squabbled,
Our customers wobbled
To the products inferior
Of Spain and of France.
You knights of the willow
Who over the billow
With newspaper splashes
Next season will go.
May Fortune attend you,
My sons, and Lord send you
May snavei the Ashes
And collar the dough.
But cut out the brawling
And squabbling and squalling,
These rows are a damper,
A blot on the line.
Take equably winning
And wallops with grinning,
Unless you would hamper
The sale of our wine.

“Moby-Dick”: Re this argument
about the King’s right to certain fish, the
following is from Blackstone:
A tenth branch of the King’s ordinary
revenue, said to be grounded’ on the Considera-
tion of his guarding and protecting the seas
from pirates and robbers, is the right to royal
fish, which are whales and sturgeon. And
these, when either thrown ashore or caught
near the coast, are the property of the King.
Then the deceased whale stranded in the
Hunter River belongs to King George.

“Spare Raphael”: If, as “Cafe Royal”
insists, allegedly Bohemian artists in-
variably depict a crayfish that never was
on sea or land (B. 13/9/’33), what about
the draughtsman who always presents the
lyrebird with his tail feathers elevated in
the form of a lyre? This is quite in-
correct. When not displayed, the two
large feathers are held straight out be-
hind, parallel to each other ; when dis-
played, they fall out laterally on each
side. The artistic error is repeated too
often by taxidermists who have never
seen the real bird in action on his native
heath, for here also the lyre effect is per-
sisted in. Whether the artist or the taxi-
dermist is originally to blame, it is hard
to say.

“D.E.”: On the third day of the
A.J.C. spring meeting I got out of a La
Perouse car to walk to the Kensington
tramstop and then over the road to the
racecourse, taking the narrow pad be-
tween the banked-up line and the picket
fence. I hadn’t gone 50 yards when a
black snake slithered across my route
into thick grass. Sixty or seventy yards
further on there was another. I nearly
trod on that one, and, although only a
young ’un, he was big enough to be
capable of mischief. On the other side
“But if this little chap is to be Georgie, his brother’s Christian name cant be

of the line are Centennial Park and its
lakes ; still you wouldn’t expect to find
snakes where I encountered them. Evi-
dently a sign that it’s going to be a bad
season for wrigglers.

“Pons”: Dog-fanciers in Britain and
the U.S.A. seem worried over the in-
crease amongst tykes of the malady
called canine hysteria, or “fright disease.”
The afflicted hounds are said to assume
a terror-stricken air at their masters
lightest words, and, between whiles, to
look as gloomy as a man copped faking
an income-tax return. An English vet.
trouble is due to the use of

“Hoyle’s Understudy”: After a good
many years’ experience of chess and
bridge, I prefer bridge er e
tion or contact not because it is -
handed, and therefore a more social sort
game, but because it is a more stin -
bating mental exercise, better spoit an
nearer to the conditions of the game of
ble. In chess both sides aie dealt e
satne hand. It is possible to play 18 or
moves in accordance with an exact
punctilio like fencing with someone
w ho learned his swordplay in the same
school as you did. Alter that it depends
on how much further one player or the
other can lollow a line of logic. I once
beat a champion by an unoithodox
opening that led to the castling move by
which Morphy won most of his battles.
“Try that on again, young man!”
said the veteran between clenched teeth,
and five minutes later I was utterly
routed. Bridge, no matter what profes-
sionals may say about it, doesn’t lend
itself to such brutality. It is a battle in
which the material strength of the forces,
as in wars on a larger table, isn’t known
until part of the attacking army is in
sight. The Napoleons of bridge cannot
rout even a moderately competent oppos-
ing general who has a preponderance of
big artillery. They cannot even assume
the role of attackers unless chance favors
them. They may win a long campaign
by sheer superior strategy, but the imp
of chance keeps them on their toes. H. G.
Wells dismissed bridge with the scornful
remark that anybody could easily master
jts principles, missing the point that this
feature, combined with the element
of luck, makes it a more entertaining
pastime than those in which talented
specialists can exercise an absolute
tyranny.
“Toowong Reach”: Queenslanders will
be interested in the cable regarding the
rapid growth of the blue-flowered water-
hyacinth, which, introduced from Banana-
land years ago, is threatening to block
the Bengal waterways. In the ’nine-
ties it looked as if the Brisbane River
were going to be wiped out as a port by
the floating pest. Introduced from South
America by some spiritual affinity of
the persons who acclimatised the rabbit
and the prickly-pear, it gradually found
its way from the upper reaches of the
river and its tributaries until it blocked
the big waterway so thickly at Brisbane
that ferry-boats were hung up by it and
the screws of ocean-going steamers en-
tangled. Getting rid of the hyacinth was
costly. Landowners were made respons-
ible for clearing it off in their ponds

and creeks, and it was found that when
it reached salt water it died. As the fresh
supplies from up the river gradually
ceased, the rotting masses below were
swept away to sea by the tides and the
trouble passed. Only a few years later
the lower reaches of the Mississippi in
the region of New Orleans had to face
a similar trouble, but it passed as the
Queensland visitation did.

“Dr. Mivart”: I often wonder why the
mathematicians who have so ingeniously
supplied the doctrine of the creed of
Relativity haven’t boldly announced that
they have an explanation of the faculty
of pre-perception. There is
such a faculty. The Scots
call it “second sight”; the
Irish, “seeing the ghost of
it.” One of its most com-
mon manifestations is that
queer moment when a poker-
player has an irrational con-
viction that he will add a
fourth ace to the three he
holds in his hand, or fill a
bobtail flush. The sense isn’t
confined to gambling. An
event, more often trivial than
important, occurs, and before
it is half-way through you
say to yourself “All this hap-
pened before. I know ex-
actly what will happen next.”
Aunt Jane passes the pepper,
and before you grasp it you
know she is going to say,
dramatically, “I must get
something to cope with those
.snails. They’ve left me
hardly a single cabbage.”
You have no interest in her
cabbage-garden; hardly re-
member that she grows cab-
bages ; but you know she’s
going to say that, and she
does. Mark Twain, in one
of his serious essays, gives
personal testimony of such
experiences. Edding-
ton’s “Mathematical Theory
of Relativity,” I won’t say proves,
but purports to prove, that time can
move at different rates under concurrent
but varying conditions. The assumption
is breath-taking in its implications. It
means that an event in one set of con-
ditions may be observed in another set
of conditions before it occurs in the first
set.

“C.P.C.”: Point Charles lighthouse, 16
miles outside Darwin, for many years
was under the care of Hugh M. Christie,
one of the most enthusiastic amateur
naturalists who ever lived in the North.
Christie knew the haunts and the habits
of most creatures in the coastal belt, from
crocodiles to leeches, and he was a fine
taxidermist as well. During his long
spin at Point Charles the finest fruit
Darwin ever had came from the garden
he made from virgin bush. His energy
for gardening infected his offsiders, and
when he died the plantation of bananas.
pawpaws, mangoes, pineapples and the
rest of them totalled many acres. When
the old man wasn’t on lighthouse duty
or gardening he went aboard his small
cutter and, with a couple of boys, poked
along the coast to east or west getting
specimens for museums. No trace of
his garden survives.

“W.P.T.”: Whenever strong men are
being discussed in Nimmitabel (N.S.W.)
there is an argument as to whether store-
keeper John Fakhrey or Mick Joseph
was the stronger. Teeth marks on the
corner of a big table in one of the pubs
are shown as corroboration of a legend
that Joseph picked it up in his teeth and
lifted it, tipping three men off it on to
the floor. He also pulled nails out of
wood with his teeth. There was not a
draught horse in the district, however,
who could scratch-pull John Fakhrey.
John would dig his heels into the
ground, sit back with the trace-chains in
his hands and defy Dobbin to shift him.

“Shellback”: “Nitre - Trader” (B.
20/9/’33) must have drifted a long way
leeward of the Horn before he saw
Mother Carey’s chickens if he got to a
longitude where they don’t feed. When I
was in those waters the queer little birds,
looking no larger than a sparrow, but
actually as big as a half-grown muscovy
duck, fluttered around under the stern,
and looked as if they were just at their
last gasp and about to drop into the sea.
The grub is better aft and more victuals
are thrown out. They gobble up any scrap
that falls, alighting on the sea to do so.
The reason they are not, or were not,
fished for lies in an old seafaring super-
stition that to catch one brings disaster to
the ship. Like most seabirds when caught
and brought on deck, Careys become
violently sick, and the amount of un-
digested food they bring up is marvel-
lous. As to catching albatrosses with
sail-hooks, the way it was done when
I used to refrigerate around Cape
Stiff was to cut a piece of tin into an
oval shape and snip a triangular hole
in it, with the sharpest angle pointing
aft; to this was attached a wooden float.
Pork fat was tied around the tin for bait,
leaving the hole open. Bait and float
were fastened to a line and towed astern.
On the albatross grabbing the bait, his
hooked beak was caught in the hole, and
while there was a strain on the line it
was impossible for the bird to get away.
The reason why most seabirds flutter
round the stern when they see a ship is
to see her port of registry. If it’s Aber-
deen or Dundee, they vanish.
THE OUTBACKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We are going back to the old address, where
the ways are hard and long;
We are going back to the border-lands, where
the hearts are big and strong;
We are going back to the things we left and
the men we learned to know,
To the life we lived and we say we loved—but
we are not glad to go.
To the life we left we are going back, as we
Andmtle enough 1 shah we take with us to add
to our scanty store.
For we’ve only learned in our brief sojourn
where the people fret and fuss
That the narrow streets where men buy and
sell have no resting place for us.
... , . . * - M „
£ S“.he r L a
But ever — for all we said or did — we knew
what the end must be.
We might hold our place for a year or two,
and say we have won, and then
Comes the turn of the wheel that flings us out
to the fringe of things again.
We are going back to the old address; we say
we are glad to go,
And we jeer at the things we leave behind, but
deep in our hearts we know
That we’ve failed again, as we’ve failed before,
and deeply the knowledge stings,
Though we’re only flotsam that’s ever flung
far out to the fringe of things.

Pty., Ltd., 860 Collins Street, Melbourne, C.l.
OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY: The Company has been formed for the purpose, inter
alia, of acquiring and taking over from Western Gold Mines, N.L., as at September 1, 1933,
certain mining leases (totalling 84 acres), reserve area (approximately 1842 acres), and a pipe-
track water right, etc., together with certain buildings, plant, machinery and appliances, ore at
grass, tailings, etc., thereon. These properties are situated on the Murchison goldfield, Western
Australia, 11 miles from the railway line connecting the deep-sea port of Geraldton with Cue,
Meekatharra and Wiluna. By road they lie 35 miles north-east of Cue, which is 262 miles
from Geraldton.
GOLD PRICE BASIS: All the ore values and profits stated herein are based on gold at
140 s. Australian currency per ounce fine.
TESTING WORK DONE ON THE PROPERTIES: The sum total of the ore extracted
and treated by the Mararoa Company, which came from the exploratory work and from the
small amount of stoping done on the leases, is reported as 13,200 long tons for a return of
12dwt. ol fine gold per ton. From Sorenson’s lease, where a small shaft has been sunk, which
provides the present water supply of the camp, the mining of some 65 tons from a small lode
yielded 4.15 ounces per ton.
The more extensive of the underground workings are on the Emu North lease. Here a
shaft was sunk by the Mararoa Company to a depth of 180 feet, and levels were opened at
110 feet and 160 feet from the surface. In these workings the lode has been driven on for a
maximum distance of 450 feet.
Approximately 1000 feet to the southwards are the Emu Workings on the adjoining lease,
where a shaft has been sunk to 160 feet and levels opened at 35 feet, 80 feet and 130 feet below
the surface, exposing the lode channel for a maximum length of 240 feet.
Prior to Western Gold Mines, N.L., taking an option over the leases, the Mararoa
Company, under an arrangement with the Western Australian Government, had sunk five
diamond-drill holes to cut the lode below the bottom level in the Emu North. Western Gold
Mines, N.L., have drilled nine more holes, and have also had a geophysical survey made of
the property.
The Mararoa Company’s drill-holes (Nos. 1 to 5) showed values ranging from 435. Id.
to 725. 3d. per ton over calculated true lode widths from 4ft. 6in to 10ft. 6in.
Nos. 6 to 11 bores, inclusive, drilled on the northern extension of the Emu North
ore-body, showed the shear zone still continuing strongly to the north, but only the first two
(Nos. 6 and 7) cut payable ore. Nos. 12 and 13 holes were then drilled to test the lode, at
greater depth below Nos. 3 and 6 bores, respectively. No. 14 bore-hole, the site for which
was selected 900 ft. south of the Emu North ore-body, cut the continuation of this shear
zone, as predicted by the geophysical survey.
Bores Nos. 6,7, 12, 13 and 14 showed values from 265. 3d. to 84s. per ton over calculated
true lode widths from Bft. to 29ft. llin.
The ore-body cut in No. 14 bore-hole was in three sections, namely:—l2ft. 10in.,
value 655.; '7ft. 3in., value 405.; and 9ft. 9in., value 445. 9d. Between Ist and 2nd and
the 2nd and 3rd sections were 26ft. 2in. of low-grade lode material and 13ft. Bin. of country
rock respectively. The further extension of No. 14 bore-hole passed through 39in. true width
of ore assaying 51s. lOd. per ton, this being approximately 190 ft. to the eastward of the
known ore-body.
The geophysical survey has been carried out by the Swedish Geophysical Prospecting Co.,'
under the direction of their engineer, Mr. Horvath, who states that his measurements indicate
the position of the shear zones in which the ore-bearing shoots are found, but do not define
the ore-shoots themselves within the shear zones. His work shows that the shear zones which
include the Emu North and Emu Workings respectively are separate, and that they extend
much further than had been anticipated.
Following on the recommendation of Mr. Horvath, the site for No. 14 bore-hole was
selected to test the prediction of the geophysical survey that the shear zone including the
Emu North ore-body extended to the south. The wide ore-body intersected in this hole (see
above) confirms this prediction.
No. 15 bore-hole has been located 800 ft. south of No. 14 hole, with the object of cutting
both the shear zones in this unexplored locality. No boring results are yet to hand.
ESTIMATED ORE RESERVE, COSTS AND PROFITS: The examination of the property
by Mr. C. G. Gibson was made in May last. His report states that the old workings, together
with subsequent diamond-drillings, have shown the existence of an ore-body, between Nos. 5
and 7 bores, not less than 680 ft. long, with an average width of Bft., and worth, as sampled,
60s. lOd. per ton.
At the time of Mr. Gibson’s visit, Nos. 12 and 13 bore-holes had not been drilled, and
he then considered that the.work done showed “reasonably to be expected” 200,000 tons of
payable ore above the 500 ft. horizon.
While Nos.' 12 and 13 bore-holes are too. far apart to give a definite value for the ore
at the deeper horizons, Mr. Gibson gives his opinion that they may be fairly considered to
add 50 per cent, to the tonnage reasonably to be expected from previous developments, thus
raising the quantity to 300,000 tons.
As a consequence of unavoidable dilution in mining, the milling grade will be rather
lower than the assay value of the ore-body as sampled, namely, 60s. lOd. per ton, and a fair
estimate of the milling grade is 565. per ton.
Calculating on an output of, say, 200 tons a day and . 325. 6d. per ton to cover working
costs, and loss in mill tailings, the “working profit” reasonably to be expected from mining
and treating the, 300,000 tons estimated to exist in the Emu North ore-shoot above the
650ft.-700ft. horizon is approximately £350,000.
Should subsequent exploration show that a larger output from the property is warranted,
a reduction in working costs may be anticipated.
A factor of the greatest importance, as indicating the probability that the further prospect-
ing and development of this property will make available a large tonnage of ore, is the
proving in the Emu Section of No. 14 bore of a width approximating 30ft. of payable ore
beyond the limits of previous workings, > and the Emu North ore-shoot referred to above.
This is particularly encouraging, since it confirms the expectations of the geophysical survey
of the extension-of the shear zones. This result, in conjunction with the intersection in No. 12
bore, at the deepest horizon yet explored, of the highest grade (12dwt.) and greatest width
(17ft.) of ore yet found in the Emu North ore-shoot, amply justifies the view that there are
excellent prospects for substantial additions to the ore reserve both from extensions in depth
of the ore-shoot mentioned and from lateral explorations.
FINANCIAL PROGRAMME: It is estimated that the present issue of shares, after
discharging flotation expenses, brokerage and payments mentioned in this Prospectus, will
provide funds sufficient to further prospect, develop and equip the property with mining and
milling plant and accessories, and bring same into production.

ABOUT MOTS.
“Mot men who have had dealings with cattle,
realise the large amount of variation which exists
in any pure-bred herd:” — N.S.W. country paper.
It accounts for a curious phenomenon
—the ever-increasing number of cattle
men who are becoming mot men.
Mots can be reared anywhere except
in gas retorts. The tick regulations do
not apply in their case, and, like pigs,
they are not classed as animals by P.P.
boards. They may be travelled in conse-
quence without the T brand on their
rumps. They are tractable except in the
motting season, when they come for a
brief space under the provision of the
Noxious Trades Act.
Mots remain in all circumstances true
to type. A mot is a mot, winter or
summer, drunk or sober, from India’s
coral to London’s mud-strewn Strand.
As all mots are poley from birth, horn
troubles are unknown ; and their free-
dom from political affiliations makes
them reliable employees. Motto: “Be
kind to .mots.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Sun Clad and Chatham, both trained
in Sydney, won their respective races at
Caulfield, but the remaining events on the
programme went to Melbourne horses,
who promise to more than hold their own
against invaders at the spring meetings in
Victoria.
Sun Clad’s victory in the Debutant
Stakes, for colts and geldings, was fore-
cast by his second to Fashion Plate in
the A.J.C. Breeders’ Plate ; but Angelo
and Aztec commanded more support.
Angelo belongs to John Wren, and had
finished third in his division of the
V.R.C. Maribyrnong Trial Stakes. Inter-
ference at an early stage of the Caulfield
contest robbed Angelo of any chance.
Sun Clad scored in good style from
Aztec, who would have made the finish
tighter if he had not run out wide at the
home turn. A. E. Cooper, of the Segen-
hoe stud, Scone, paid only 85gns. for
Sun Clad at the yearling sales. The
youngster is by Sun Cure (sire of
Income) from Lineith, by Linacre from
Neith, who runs back to the Yattendon
mare Habena.
The “baby” race for fillies went to
Waltzing Nellie, held on lease by H.
Leek from the owner of Waltzing Lily.
She led practically all the way and simply
romped home. Hustle On, rated as the
fastest juvenile in Victoria, ran off the
course at the turn into the straight, and
fell when being pulled up.
All the races were run in record time.

Palphar, who registered a one-act vic-
tory in the Guineas, covered the mile in
fmin. 38sec., half a second better than
Ammon Ra’s time. Holt was sanguine
concerning the prospects of Hall Mark,
but the A.J.C. Derby hero let him down.
With Palphar setting the pace, everything
was made to order for Hall Mark ; but,
as in the Memsie Stakes on September 2,
he failed to come on and Palphar beat
him by H lengths. On many past occa-
sions horses have suffered defeat in the
Guineas and then captured the Victoria
Derby. Probably Hall Mark will atone
at Flemington, but he has been no model
of consistency this season. Wheriko,
strongly supported, shaped very dis-
appointingly. A long-strider and still
green, he did not relish being shut in on
the rails and was quickly out of court.
The Night Raid colt may do better at
Flemington, but is not likely to be seen
at his best until the autumn.
Palphar belongs to S. M. Freeman,
a city restaurateur. Bred in N. S. Wales
by H. S. Thompson, he realised 120gns.
as a yearling ; he is by Fernkloof (imp.)
from Shule Agra, by Eudorus from Lady
Regis, by Maltster. In the Quality Han-
dicap at Moonee Valley on September
30 Palphar collided with the running rail
and fell, his jockey, O’Brien, sustaining
a compound fracture. From his hospital
cot O’Brien listened in regretfully to the
broadcast description of Palphar’s vic-
tory in the Guineas. Sydney horseman
Knox, who obtained the winning mount,
did not have unalloyed satisfaction, as
at the close of the day he was suspended
for a month for having crossed the field
too sharply soon after the start of the
Guineas. Rarely does a Melbourne
meeting pass without some jockey being
stood down for a long or short period.
Big punters had to lay only 10 to 9 on
Chatham for the Caulfield Stakes. Some
of them reckoned that the dual Epsom
Handicap winner is not a Caulfield horse,
and accordingly supported Kuvera and
Middle Watch. It was the most thrilling
race of the afternoon. Pike handled
Chatham to perfection. He took the
Windbag stallion to the front, but did
not apply full pressure until the home
turn was reached. A snappy effort there
gave the favorite an advantage which
he retained without difficulty, winning by
three-quarters of a length in lmin.
51 sec.; the previous best was lmin.
511 sec. by Heroic. Middle Watch,
Kuvera and Dermid had a desperate
battle for minor places. Middle Watch,
by sheer gameness, reached the judge a
head in advance of Kuvera and Dermid,
who dead-heated for third. Unfor-
tunately Middle Watch pulled up lame.
Many Caulfield Cup candidates com-
peted in the Herbert Power Handicap
and Toorak Handicap, which were an-
nexed by Segati and Chilperic respec-
tively. Segati finished third to Rogilla
in the Caulfield Cup last year with 6st.
121 b. She is very small, and will be
troubled to handle 7st. 121 b. next Satur-
day. Gaine Carrington did well to run
third in the Toorak Handicap, and, in
the hands of Jim Pike, he will take a
lot of beating in the Caulfield Cup. Bul-
letin scribe expects him to succeed, after
fighting out the finish with Kuvera and
Topical. The best outsider may be
Ruach.
* * * *
Every favorite went down at City
Tatt.’s meeting at Randwick, although
four of the seven winners were pretty
well backed. Secretary Maidment was
pleased with the attendance of 24,000,
which was larger than the crowd at the
corresponding meeting last year; and
bookies reported that money was fairly
plentiful.
Newcastle people thought Cercello a
good thing for the first division of the
Novice, but he shaped badly, and
Gothic’s burly son Gothlin (6 to 1),
owned by two Sydney sportsmen who
race as “C. and R. Maxim,” won easily
from the pacemaker, Leone, who was
lugging badly from the turn. Wallace
Cup was a good third. Gothlin is trained
by Jack King, who was in Melbourne
with Turbine. The favorite, Lion
Hearted, gave an inglorious display. He
looked as if he requires more galloping,
and he may be worth following when
he fines down.
The second division provided a stirring
finish between Venusta (12 to 1) and
Fairoc ; Venusta won in the last couple
of strides, with Hurry Scurry third. She
is owned and trained by E. F. Smith, of
Stockton, who bred the four-year-old
daughter of Spelthorne and Bundie and
her half-brother Rowan. The favorite,
Prince’s Daughter, owned by Dick
Wootton, let her backers down badly.
Backed from 33 to 1 to eights, Highboy
beat a field of smart sprinters in the Fly-
ing Handicap. The Pantheon gelding,
who was ridden by the apprentice
Stanton, son of the trainer of Prince
Bruce, flew from the Leger and made
hacks of Tom Pinch and the consistent
Questionnaire. Multudo tried to lead all
the way ; he tired, and was cut out of
fourth place by Vista in the last stride.
Highboy showed promise as a two-year-
old, but did not redeem it last season.
He is bred to stay, and is owned by a
Campbelltown pastoralist, T. W. Board-
man.
Sov, winner of the Two-year-old
Stakes, at sixes, is a well-grown and well-
bred colt by Heroic from Golden Curio.
He came fast on the outside to win nar-
rowly from Lady Glitter, who is trained
by ex-jockey Percy Maher, with the hot
favorite, Constantine, a close third, just
in advance of Mangelo. But for
stumbling after passing the furlong pole
Mangelo would have been first instead
of fourth. Sov is raced in partnership
by Frank Spurway and W. M. Martin,
and carries the colors of Soorak, who
was narrowly beaten in the A.J.C. Derby
by Rivoli.
There was a deal of interference in
City Tatt.’s Handicap. Touchit lost her
rider, and Bold Boy had no luck in run-
ning. Satmoth (6 to 1) took charge in
the straight and scored easily from Love
Song, ridden by Pratt, who was sus-
pended for two months for carelessness.
Serabite was a good third ; despite his
hard time during the last two months
he is standing up to racing in a remark-
able fashion.
The Bulletin’s choice, Aussie’s De-
light, completed the hat trick when he
won the Club Welter at sevens. Twelves
had been laid, and the tote paid £8 4s. and
£2 ss. for 10s. The favorite, Cynical,
was well enough placed at the turn, but
he is only a moderate. Tingalba and
Havaspot both tried to run down Aussie’s
Delight, but they were tired when the
judge was reached. On form Aussie’s
Delight should have been favorite.
* * * *
For Warwick Farm on Saturday:
Maiden Handicap: Var Sun; next,
Preyful.
Macquarie Grove Handicap: High-
boy; next, Tingalba.
Varroville Handicap: Legislator;
next, Tatyoon.
Homebush Handicap: Love Song:
next, Satmoth.
Farm Stakes: Lancaster King ; next,
Silver Song.
“Ike Mcßagg”: The Cesarewitch was
won by Seminole, by Diligence —Blanch,
dam of that great sire Blanchford.
Winner is owned by one of the Ameri-
can Wideners, and came to the rescue
of the profession by going out a 100-to-6
chance. As second and third prads came
home at similar prices, the boys got a
bit of their own back after the lucky
run of favorites in the classics this year.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Walter Browning and George Penchiff
were again opponents at Leichhardt on
Saturday. Penchiff is the better wrestler
but Browning has a great advantage in
weight. A Boston crab gained him a
fall in the second, and a short-arm scis-
sors another in the sixth; meanwhile
Penchiff won a fall on his own account,
also with a short-arm scissors. Brown-
ing, of course. The hall was crowded,
many of the spectators being women,
who chewed peanuts when they weren’t
licking ice-cream.
Ins and Outs
“Bowen Hills”: Queensland cricket
seems likely to gain by the return of
Cecil Thompson to the fold, he having
nominated for inclusion in the Country
Week games. The big fellow is probably
the best batsman Queensland has pro-
duced to date, and though he has not
played serious cricket since 1931 should
still get among the runs. In the 1930-31
season he headed the Australian first-
class averages, including the West Indian
matches, with 79.16 and a highest score
of 275 n.o.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Hird, the Balmain all-
rounder, whom many tipped for the next
Australian XI, should be well satisfied
with his first League cricket season with
Ramsbottom club in Lancashire. The
advent of the Australian jumped the
gates up to £660 for the season, or nearly
five times ahead of the previous year
while subscriptions at over £5OO doubled
themselves. Hird made 821 runs and
took 79 wickets in the Saturday after-
noon League games. The wickets cost
14 runs apiece, while the batting aggre-
gate was a club record.
The Nineteenth Hole
The N.S.W. close championship proved
a triumph for Jim Ferrier, of Manly, who
crowned a successful year with a fine
card of 291 for 72 holes of stroke, lour
strokes better than title-holder V. S.
Richardson. On the second day, five
strokes in arrears from Richardson and
Souter, the youngster reeled off 69, 68,
seven under par for the day.
* * * *
“Whillaloo”: That reference to the
Irish invasion of golf (B. 4/10/’33) re-
minds me that it is not confined to the he-
man golfer. Brisbane rejoices in a young
player, Miss M. Murphy, who is greatly
addicted to wiping the fioor with the
opposition in club competitions in which
she has been taking part this season. At
Indooroopilly recently the young lady
won four events and was runner-up in
another. The experts predict great things
for her.
* * * *
“Picklock”: The ingenious American
does not confine himself to schemes lor
banishing the depression —he even bursts
on golf with innovations. A mixed
foursomes competition in Nevada had
for first prize the offer by a prominent
Reno lawyer to handle free of charge
any divorce proceedings in which the
winners might subsequently be mixed up.
In Australia, where golf is played all the
year round, such a prize would be
superfluous. Here, husband and wife
who play golf are practically divorced
as it is. She is away on the course every
day in the week, and he, absent from
home during the week at the office, car-
ries on the tradition on the links over
the week-ends.
*** v *
“Divot Digger”: The Australian golf
authorities continue to potter about with
the idea of inviting a British team to
visit this country, but nothing very defi-
nite seem to have been done, though it
leaked out in Queensland the other day
that the State Golf Council there would
have to toss £BO into the tambourine if
it intended to meet local expenses of the
team of four amateurs. St. Andrews
consented to the trip some time ago, and
staggered humanity by offering to pay
all expenses from Britain to Fremantle
and back, so there has been plenty of
time to get down to brass tacks on this
side.
The Combined G.P.S. sports at Sydney
Cricket Ground saw four records bettered
and one equalled in the senior and
junior divisions. Outstanding_ in the
senior events were Barbour’s 50 2-ssec.
for the 440 ; the 121 b. shot putt of Clark,
of High, 48ft. Bin.; Henderson’s 100 and
220 in 10 l-ssec. and 22 2-ssec. and
Maguire’s half-mile and mile runs in
2min. 2sec. and 4min. 39 3-ssec. Gram-
mar scored its 26th championship.
* * * *
The N.R.A. King’s Prize, shot for at
Anzac range in N.S.W., was won by
J. R. Feltham, of Marulan, with the fine
score of 344 out of a possible 355. This
is an Australasian record under the new
conditions, which enjoin the use of the
short rifle and Mark VII. ammunition.
* * * *
Following on their defeat in the first
Test with the English Northern Union,
the Rugby League Kangaroos were twice
beaten last week —by Bradford Northern,
7-5, and Warrington, 15-12.
* * *
“Cranbourne”: Polo is to be added
to the welter of sporting competitions
with which Melbourne proposes to cele-
brate its centenary next year. In addi-
tion to the annual Stradbroke Cup tour-
ney, a special tamasha will be held in
the spring.

Three days from Sydney and you are in won-

Ins and Outs
The Marylebone C.C. and the board
of Control last week “released” the de-
tails of their diplomatic protocols in con-
nection with the bodyline-bowling dis-
pute. As most of us expected, the
mutual exchanges were entirely concilia-
tory and on the agreeable plane of
mutual concession which used to dis-
tinguish the amenities of Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Shean. Each party has side-
stepped the real issue, and “face” has
been saved gracefully. Peace is probable
for the future, but not if some people
can help it. Larwood and Duckworth
have been brought out of their winter
fastnesses to deliver themselves of some
characteristically uncouth sentiments on
the subject of Australians. Mr. Kelly
and Mr. Hartigan are so indignant with
these worthies that they suggest a special
meeting of the Board of Control. It
should not be held.
* * * *
“Yarker”: I see that Larwood, whose
increasing and ill-advised vociferousness
suggests that he would be better em-
ployed in Parliament than on the cricket
field, has announced that it is more than
likely he will refuse to play against the
Australians if asked, unless he is per-
mitted to bowl his bodyline stuff. If
that happens, it will be no great loss to
England. In this country and at home
the Notts pitboy is two different bowl-
ing propositions. He was a success here
with Chapman’s team in 1928-29, taking
40 wickets for an average of under 12
apiece. In England the following year
he took four wickets in the Tests at 74
runs apiece.
j|c j{:
“Five Ways”: One-day professional
cricket, which had-been heralded in Bris-
bane with much trumpeting, made rather
a feeble debut, drawing a poor attend-
ance. The signed-up teams included few
players of class, and the so-called “rules’
were practically those of a new game.
Each side had three innings, the batsman
receiving only 10 balls in the first two
unless he was dismissed. The remaining
time was divided equally between the
teams. As there were special induce-
ments for big hits, all hands dropped
any attempt at stroke-making and went
out with the long handle to swipe. As
cricket, the show was a travesty.
* * * *
“Trent Bridge”: Someone started an
argument in the London press as the
cricket season came to a close as to
which English batsman had the highest
average for 20 seasons back. The un-
thinking plumped for Hobbs, but fell
in badly, for when the figures were ticked
off Hendren came out on top with an
average of just over 50, Hobbs taking
second place with 49 and a fraction. The
inquiry showed that the veteran Mead,
remembered in Australia as a stodgy left-
hander who could do nothing right,
though he was another proposition in
England, had passed the 50,000-run
mark in first-class cricket. “W.G.” and
Hobbs are the only others, and Mead’s
average for that lot is 48.54.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: The tennis event of the
hour as far as Australia is concerned was
the return of our Davis Cup team, or
half of it, in the shape of Jack Crawford
and Viv McGrath. Crawford has been
ordered to go slow by the quacks and
will not play in singles for some weeks.
He blames nervous strain and insomnia
for his collapse against Perry in their
match at New York, and evidently should
be turned out to grass until the English-
men heave in sight. Quist and Turnbull
are coming by a later boat, but both will
be seen in action in Sydney during the
N.S.W.-Victoria match the first week in
November.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: One of the most
refreshing interviews on the arrival in
Sydney of the advance contingent of the
Davis Cup team was given by young V iv
McGrath, who dwelt in some detail on
the latest feminine craze in Europe and
America for wearing shorts at tennis.
Indeed, his description of one famous
playerette in America “with black, hairy
legs” conjured up visions of tarantulas
to all who read it.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: After all, Ellsworth
Vines has turned professional; he has
joined Tilden’s circus on a one-year con-
tract. He is to receive 25,000 dollars
cash and will make as much more with
his share of picture and advertising
rights. His d£but will be at Madison
Square Garden in New York on January
10, when he and Tilden will meet in a
series. By the end of the year many
more of the star amateurs will have gone
where the money is. The only chance
of stopping the desertions is for the
international tennis authorities to come
off their perches and permit open
matches, with pros, and amateurs play-
ing together as in golf and cricket.
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: I view with horror the
approach of the tennis season in Mel-
bourne. The frightfulness of the bodyline
controversy will be nothing to the
terrors of the imminent contest over
leg-line. News that the gals in Eng-
land have not merely taken off their
skirts but the trousers that were sub-
stituted for them has reached us, and
some of our most eminent feminine
racquet-wielders have declared that they
will strip themselves to shirt and shorts
and devil take the tennis conventions.
These, presumably, are the ones with
the nice figures. The veterans, following
bathing-costume precedent, are all for
the refinement and ladylike appearance
of the skirt, and blow athletic efficiency.
The males, who are the real sumptuary
authorities in this matter, are divided.
Harley Malcolm is an upholder of
early-Victorian ideals of feminine mod-
esty ; but others disagree with him. The
women will have their way in the long
run.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: Last week saw the
clean-up of the Australian golfing sea-
son —that is, where the big events were
concerned. In Victoria, A. W. Jackson,
runner-up in both the open and ama-
teur Australian championships, and
winner with C. H. Fawcett of the national
foursomes title, took his State’s amateur
title, beating young Harry Williams. At
the same meeting Mick Ryan and Sloan
Morpeth, the ex-Maorilander, won the
State foursomes, while in women’s goif
Mona McLeod downed Susie Tolhurst
for the Victorian champion of cham-
pions title. In Sydney, the Ma State
foursomes were reft from the holders,
Dr. and Mrs. Bettington, by a young
pair from Wollongong, the Ashtons,
brother and sister. In Westralia the State
amateur and professional titles were
bagged by H. G. Godden and E. D.
Bissett respectively.
* * * *
The State country golf championships
drew a large and enthusiastic entry to
Sydney from all parts of N.S.W. The
singles title was won by J. C. Mclntosh,
of Lismore, who finished the 36 holes
with a card of 150 (75, 75). Newcastle
walked off with the clubs premiership,
beating the Blue Mountains by six
matches to three. Davison and Bassing-
thwaite were successful in the foursomes,
which they also captured in 1931. Their
tally for the 36 holes was 159, a stroke
better than the runners-up, E. O.
Campbell and N. Finlay.
* * * *
“Salvation Yeo”: The bleakness of
Westward Ho in Devonshire, where the
English women’s golf championships
were held recently, was illumined by the
appearance of one Gloria Minoprio, who
walked to the first tee in high-heeled
shoes, with silk socks, perfectly-creased
trousers, a jersey and beret, and a red
suede jacket. Gloria appeared in this
guise by way of calling public attention
to her claim that people use too many
clubs in golf nowadays —wherein the
writer agrees with the lady —and she cer-
tainly seems to have succeeded, for she
was “news” in the papers and cables
next morning. If Gloria had let it go
at that all might have been well, but she
overdid matters by attempting her first
championship round armed with a cleek
only. In the hands of an expert the old-
fashioned club might have lived up to
Gloria’s opinion of it. Alas! She was
no expert, and was well walloped by a
damsel with a large bag of clubs and
wearing a severe tweed tailor-made.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: If this story had come
from America there would have been
some reason for regarding it with sus-
picion, but as the hero lives near New-
castle-on-Tyne, where the folk are
notoriously truthful, it can only be re-
garded as one of the perennial wonders
of golf. The said hero is John Aitken.
of Cowgate, and though he is stone blind
he is a regular golfer. He is accompanied
by a legless caddie who gives him his
stance for shots from the tee and
through the green. When it is time to
putt, the caddie goes to the iron rod
carrying the hole-flag and taps it with a
steel clubhead. Guided by the sound
the blind man then proceeds to sink the
pill.
* * * *
“Lakeside”: A legal ruling of an un-
usual kind in which golf was involved
was delivered in America recently. A
woman motorist passing beside a golf
fairway was struck by a flying ball and
sued the striker. He pleaded that as the
ball was badly sliced the happening must
be construed as ap “act of God.” His
Honor refused to regard a slice as a
matter entirely to be laid at the door of
Providence ; £l5O damages.
Car and Cycle
“Piute”: I have often wondered how it
is our bookmakers and union secretaries
are content to buzz about in mere Rolls-
Royces instead of getting a “Golden
Bug,” otherwise a special Bugatti car, only
made for the elect, and the very gilded
elect at that. One, just completed
for a Captain Fraser, was shown at
Olympia recently. Like the others of its
kind it cost £7OOO, the chassis alone stick-
ing up the buyer for £5250; the
price of the body varies according to the
amount of gold-plating favored. The
bonnet, from wind-screen to radiator,
measures seven feet. The engine is a 78.
h.p. eight-cylinder job, the cylinders hav-
ing a bore and stroke of 125 mm. by
130 mm., or 12,760 c.c. capacity. With
English taxation on cylinder capacity,
this car calls for a small fortune just to
keep in the garage.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Malcolm Campbell’s new
car in which he is to tackle his own
speed record is now under way, and the
problem before the designers, R. A.
Railton and Captain Irving, is the find-
ing of an effective four-wheel drive to
supplant the rear axle drive used in the
earlier cars. The decision to hold the
attempt at Daytona will influence the
type of the car. With the rear drive,
acceleration is limited to 9ft. a second ;
and for an effective four-wheel, 22ft. per
second. Daytona gives only 4| miles for
acceleration, then the measured mile, and
then miles for pulling up. The increased
acceleration will make all the difference
on this limited course, and Campbell’s
objective of 300 m.p.h. is easily attainable
if the car designers can solve their pro-
blem satisfactorily. The four-wheel drive
will ensure a smaller and lighter car,
this helping acceleration and greatly re-
ducing tyre stress.

“Kick Starter”: Woods, who is ex-
pected to visit Australia next year for the
centenary celebrations in Victoria, added
another to his long list pf road wins hy
taking the Ulster T.T. race last week.
Riding in the senior section for motor-
cycles of 500 c.c. capacity, Woods cov-
ered the circuit of ten 20-mile laps at
an average speed of 87.43 m.p.h., this
being his fourth successive win in this
event. His great rival, Percy Hunt, who
is also expected in Australia, didn’t run
into a place.

“Sprocket”: Ernest Milliken, the Vic-
torian amateur who holds the world’s
push-bike record for 100 miles on the
road, put up a great performance in win-
ning the 100-mile paced championship of
Australia in Vic. He cleared out from
the field of 45 from the start and com-
pleted his spin in 4hr. 52min. 2sec. from
the pistol. Victorians swear by their man
for first pick in the cycling section of the
tiext Australian Olympic team.
Miscellaneous
“Gate”: The Rugby League in Sydney
has resolved to officially stage night foot-
ball under electric light during the sum-
mer months, despite strong opposition
from some of the wiser executives. The
move is actuated by a desire to build up
the fund for keeping players in Sydney.
It will certainly do the League more harm
than good. A winter’s football under
any code is enough for the average man,
who likes to vary his sports as he varies
his drinks, and to drag the game over
into the cricket season is well calculated
to put the keenest barracker off football
for a long time. Players deprived of the
summer spell will also suffer. It is a pity
to see the Uni. club sanctioning this
sordid gate-money project.
*,* * *
“Third Base”: There is a chance that
the much-discussed project of a visit
from a team of first-class American base-
ballers may corpe to something after all
the disappointments. It may be that the
tour will be one of two teams playing
exhibition matches against each other, as
well as appearing in games against local
players. McGraw’s 1914 lot played
only exhibition games in Australia, base-
ball here being then in the kindergarten
class, but there should be no trouble
nowadays in shaking a side together
which would make a decent show.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Having taken the
plunge into professional rowing, Bobby
Pearce is evidently out to make hay while
the going is good. He was recently
sounded as to coming back to Australia
to race another Australian oarsman for
his world’s championship title, but has
replied that he is so signed up with con-
tracts to scull in Canada and the U.S.A.
that his time will hardly be his own for
a year or 18 months to come.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
LEARNERS AND CONTRACTORS.
“Lion”: Many big sheds to-day are
usually let out on contract for shearing.
The idea is bringing with it an evil that
should be stopped. Young fellows desir-
ous of becoming shearers cannot get a
start on a learner’s pen. Why? Because
speed is the big factor with a contractor.
He cannot be bothered with learners.
They waste his time and cost him money.
What is going to happen in the future
when the older hands cease to shear?
It is a narrow-minded policy, and will
lead to trouble. Every five stands are
supposed to have one learner, but how
many do?
A youth who is with us at the moment
tried hard to get a pen this season
and couldn’t, because no one thought
he could shear fast or well enough, hav-
ing had little experience. Knowing his
father as a good shearer, we gave him
a trial. He started at 50 a day. Now
he is doing nearly 90, clean and sure,
and we hope he will get his 100. He
has increased his tally each day, and
will take well over a thousand sheep out
of the shed by cut-out. This is only one
example Of many. We have taken the
trouble to teach him about his hand-
piece, and he has responded splendidly.
It is to be hoped that more owners of
sheep will follow suit.
STOCK-DEALING.
“Golightly”: Young farmers in a
hurry to make money try stock-dealing.
It leaves many on the rocks. During a
rapid upward movement in stock values
a reckless, inexperienced dealer may
thrive, but a day of reckoning comes.
The best purchases may be quitted at a
small loss, but the indifferent rejects re-
main on hand.
Before taking the offer of stock
make sure you have paddock room for
them, without crowding. Buy only the
best class, and be sure the written con-
tract states clearly and accurately the
number, price, age, class, rejection
allowed, exact time, date and place ot
delivery, with necessary yards for draft-
ing them off.
A shrewd dealer once bought 5000
ewes running on a snow lease, with the
right to reject the broken mouths. The
only yard was a ring that held the lot.
This defeated his right to reject at de-
livery. Rejections should not be less
than 5 p.c. over and above lame* blind
and diseased. The contract should say
how and when payment is to be made.
Don’t leave inspecting, culling and
counting to others. Count at inspection.
And consider rebranding when buying.
When selling always price rejects so the
purchaser will take them.
PLANT FOOD COUNCIL’S WORK.
The Plant Food Advisory Council of
N. S. Wales, formed in 1930, has issued
its first bulletin, which contains four sec-
tions. The first is a review of the activi-
ties to June 30. The second is the report
of the Pasture and Lucerne Committee,
the third a report by the Fruit Committee,
and the fourth a report by the Root
Crop and Vegetable Committee.
During the first year of its existence
the council decided on a policy of com-
prehensive field experiments, the details
of which were left to various sub-com-
mittees. The first important step was to
institute a kind of “More Per Acre” cam-
paign. To accomplish such an objective,
the fertility of the soil must be increased.
Enter, the experts.
The review of achievements discloses
that the council adopted a considered
policy of farm trials rather than a system
of small experimental plots. The
number of trials either carried out or
completed during the year ended June 30
last is:—•
Pasture trials .. .. .. 26
Fruit trials .. .. .. 14
Potato trials .. .. .. .. 7
Over 500 tons of lime and fertiliser
has been used ; value, £2700.
The expenses are met by the interests
represented on the council, which include
the Australian Dairy Council, Australian
Fertilisers, Ltd., Commonwealth Portland
Cement Co., Ltd., Nitrogen Fertilisers
Pty., Ltd., and Pacific Potash, Ltd.
The publication is of value to every
man on the land.
GRINDING GRAIN FOR STOCK.
“Bahb Dwyer”: Young animals with
good teeth masticate their food better
than adult stock. Pigs make better use
of maize fed whole or on the cob than
if fed cracked. Soaking maize does not
improve its digestibility. This applies
both to whole and cracked grains. Soak
or grind for older k pigs, which do not
chew the grain as well as the young
ones. Soaking gives slightly better re-
sults. Grind the smaller hard grains,
such as wheat and barley, for pigs of
all ages, or a percentage will not be mas-
ticated. Cooked foods are less diges-
tible for pigs than raw foods. Potatoes
are the only exception. But heat the foods
in winter time.
For calves, oats and maize need no
grinding, but grind and soak the harder
grains. For heifers over nine months
and adult dairy cattle, grind all classes
of cereals. Grinding maize or oats for
horses, except those on hard work or
with faulty teeth, does not yield good
results. The increased digestibility is well
under 10 p.c. For sheep, no grain needs
grinding, with the possible exception of
wheat. Even wheat should be only
coarsely cracked.
Grinding dried lucerne hay into meal
does not render it any more digestible.
Fibre remains fibre, however it is
ground or cut.
PIGS FOR PROFIT.
“Hatter”: In the present depressed
state of agriculture a margin of profit
can only be gained by efficiency. If
results fall below standard, methods
should be carefully examined. The
standard set for pig-keepers in other
countries is:
Number of pigs born alive .. .. 10
Number of pigs at six weeks .. .. 8
Average weight at six weeks .. .. 211 b.
Average weight of pigs at slaughter .. 2001 b.
Average dead weight 1501 b.
Average curing weight 1201 b.
Average age (days) in which pigs should
have reached slaughter weight 194
The. price of meal consumed every
day, wasted in some cases, wipes out
profit. Breeding stock and young pigs
do not require a ration rich in protein.
Five or six pounds of meal per day, with
a protein content of 12 p.c., produces
normal piglings and leaves the sows in
good condition. Take equal care to
avoid overfeeding when the sow is nurs-
ing, as digestive troubles which may
affect both the quantity and quality of
the milk result. She should receive only
what she will clear up readily, not all
that she will eat. Neither should her
ration be changed during the nursing
period.
Rich foods, such as concentrates, are
bad for all young animals, and piglings
are no exception, though they are often
encouraged to take them. Feed the sow
in a small trough with high sides over
which the piglings cannot climb. Feed
them in a “creep” which the sow cannot
pass. Pollard for the first few meals,
then half pollard and half barleymeal
is suitable. Ten or fourteen days later
give them 10 p.c. linseed-cake meal if
you have no milk products. Give this
ration (including chalk and salt) twice
a day until weaning time. Allow room
at the troughs for small pigs to feed com-
fortably, without crowding. Young pigs
are frequently overlaid when long straw
is used as bedding. To reduce the mor-
tality from this cause use chopped straw.
Overcrowding, lack of minerals (parti-
cularly in the breeding sow’s ration),
damp housing, draughts and unsym-
pathetic tending are further causes of
loss which you can avoid, and which too
often put the balance on the wrong side.
CATTLE-POISONING.
“Antidote”: For acute arsenic poison-
ing (B. 20/9/’33), 4oz. sulphate of iron
dissolved in 1-pint of water and mixed
with loz. magnesia, also dissolved in
1-pint of water, should be given imme-
diately, with a repeat in one hour if
necessary. If. sulphate of iron is not
available, use a solution of calcined mag-
nesia, powdered iron or iron filings.
Then give a drench of linseed tea, white
of eggs, barley water, olive or cotton-
seed oil to soothe the inflamed tissues
and membranes.
Cattle are frequently exposed to phos-
phorus poisoning from baits laid for
bunny. Symptoms are loss of appetite,
diarrhoea and labored breathing. Use
2oz. to 4oz. turpentine (according to
severity) emulsified in linseed tea, not
oil. Also give the beast some alcohol.
Expel the unabsorbed poison from the
stomach as quickly as possible with
castor-oil, which is a suitable non-irri-
tant drench. Give the oil in 1-pint to
2-pint doses, or Epsom salts in lib. doses
if the latter is used with a soothing
drench. The delicate tissues and mem-
branes of the stomach are attacked by
the poisons. Treat them immediately.
If the poison is an acid neutralise it
with an alkali (magnesia, baking soda or
soap). An alkali poison like caustic
soda, potash or ammonia is treated with
an acid.
RESERVE FEED.
“A.C.8.”: N. S. Wales coastal-belt
farmers are awakening to the im-
portance of having a fodder reserve.
Pit silos are being put down in
many parts. Superabundance of feed
in summer can be readily conserved
for leaner periods. The silo or pit
can be of any length and width, and
sometimes can be easily put into a hill-
side. Ten feet is a convenient depth.
If the ground is damp underneath, drain-
age is needed. Brick and cement the pit,
and even puddle it behind the brick-
work. Concrete may be used for the
walls.
All sorts of fodder can be made into
ensilage—lucerne, clover, prairie, oats,
wheat, maize, sorghum—or a number of
feeds may be mixed into one mass. The
stuff can go in straight from cutting.
When the pit is filled, place heavy
weights on top. Keep out air, and pre-
vent the ensilage from rotting. Feed is
enriched by the mild fermentation and
amalgamation of the whole into a semi-
solid mass. Some of the starch is con-
verted into alcohol and vinegar, thus
making the food more appetising.
CONTAGIOUS MAMMITIS.
“H.D.8.”: “Gland” (B. 4/10/’33) sug-
gests the attendance of an officer at sales
to enforce regulations that would alleg-
edly reduce the incidence of this disease.
If antiseptic measures were adopted the
saleyards would remain a source of
infection while affected cows were
offered for sale. The passage of in-
fection is considered by a majority
of research workers to be through abra-
sions on the teat and udder rather than
by way of the teat canal. Consequently
any “clean” cow lying down in the yard
would run the risk of infection if it pos-
sessed abrasions on the parts mentioned.
A farmer, after buying a cow and
bringing it on to the farm, should isolate
the animal long enough to see whether
any contagious diseases become mani-
fest. This precaution is as well a safe-
guard against contagious abortion if the
cow is forward. It will almost eliminate
the possibility of one introduced animal
infecting a whole herd.
Surely the cost of a little propaganda
along these lines would be more justified
than the cost of maintaining an officer to
supervise at sales.
MORE PER ACRE.
“Agri”: A few facts and figures con-
cerning the results of pasture-improve-
ment in southern Riverina. On natural
pasture top-dressed five years ago with
901 b. superphosphate per acre, a Jindera
farmer has produced 701 b. lambs in 12
weeks. For the last two seasons he has
topped the Melbourne lamb market. A
paddock sown broadcast with sub.
clover, then harrowed and dressed with
701 b. super p.a., produced such heavy
growth (chiefly sub. clover) in the spring
that sheep on it showed a tendency to
footrot. Extra-heavy stocking was,
needed to keep the feed reasonably short.
A dairy-farmer on the Murray, having
top-dressed a part of his farm with
super., is thrilled about the increase in
pasture-growth and milk-production and
the improved health and vitality of his
stock. Another farmer, dubious of the
benefits of pasture top-dressing, went
once round a section of land with a com-
bine, dropping super, at the rate of 701 b.
p.a., for experiment. In a few months
the grass shot up rapidly in contrast to
the rest of the field. Another convert to
pasture-improvement.
Sub. clover is the best addition to
natural pasture in southern Riverina. It
is easily sown (broadcast) and harrowed,
and responds to super. Take care in
grazing this crop.
CHEWINGS’S FESCUE.
“D.W.F.”: “Minthall,” in giving due
praise (B. 6/9/’33) to one of the world’s
best pasture grasses, does scant justice
to the M.L. pastoralist from whom it
takes its name. The grass is called after
George Chewings, who for 40 years
owned Glenelg station, Lake District,
Western Otago. Chewings was born in
Mintaro (S.A.), and went to M.L. as a
young man. In the ’nineties an Inver-
cargill seedsman sent him for trial some
unidentified seeds, apparently of the
fescue family. Chewings found that the
grass did well in the light, rather stony
soil of his property. After a few seasons
he sold seed to neighbors. Since 1900
demand for Chewings’s fescue has spread.
It has even gained popularity in America,
England and Germany. Chewings died
five or six years ago, but members of
his family continue to farm in M.L.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Suitable dye to mix with a solution for use
on the shearing board to show if cuts have been
dressed ? —BOBl.
The usual practice is to treat shear cuts with
some carbolic or phenol solution. It should not
be necessary to include any coloring matter in
preparations, but the addition of a small amount
of Bolarmen will give the dressing a reddish
stain and will have no detrimental effect.
Could the banana beetle-borer be carried by
a person unintentionally from one farm to
another ? —8252.
The banana beetle-borer moves mainly at
night, and shelters during the day in crevices
and beneath the soil near the banana stools.
Borers are not likely to crawl on to personal
clothing and be carried from plantations, but, of
course, it is not impossible.
Information as to the culture of the small
native bee of N.S.W.? —8020.
The small native bee ( Trigona carbonarid).
while useful for pollination of flowers, is of
no production value. The bees may produce
about a pint of honey in a year, but to remove
this supply means the breaking up of their
comb and probable starvation. Honey is stored
in irregularly-shaped cells or pots, not in separ-
ate combs. To carry out observations it means
almost irreparable damage to the bees’ home.
Some people find it interesting to have a colony
of these native bees about the home. As they
build in hollow limbs of trees, it is possible
generally to saw off a portion of the limb with
the bees in it and transport where desired. It
is possible, too, with careful handling, to remove
the nest in a mass from the tree and place it in
a box. If the bees are made comfortable in
their new home, and provision is made for
their entrance, they will carry on all right. Very
little is written on this native bee. It is re-
corded, however, in the publication “Australian
Insects,” by Froggatt, and in Tillyard’s textbook
on Australian and M.L. insects.
I have been milking a young cow for 12
months. During the past three months her
milk curdles when boiled. She is in good health
and is getting the correct food. What is wrong ?
—8206.
Probably this is caused by contamination of
the milk after it is drawn. Suggest that all
utensils used be carefully scalded and that cow’s
udder, prior to milking, be washed with a solu-
tion of sodium hypochlorite, at the rate of
loz. to four gallons.
Dressed leaking 1000 -gallon galvapised-iron
tank on inside with thick coat of cement and
fine sand. Still leaking slightly. Added a further
coat of similar dressing, but with a stronger
proportion of cement. After three months the
tank, continues to drip from several places.
How can l cope with the trouble ? —BlOl.
A concrete tank which is still leaking after
the described treatment should be emptied, well
cleaned, and allowed to dry. The inside sur-
face should then be treated with a mixture of
one part of waterglass (silicate of soda) in half-
gallon of water and allowed to dry. Repeat
application two or three times.
/ have a high-pressure pump used for jetting
sheep. The gauge shows a very big variation
when the jet is released; it is as much as 80 lb.
I run pump at 250 1 b. Would an extra air-
pressure chamber correct this, and, if so, what
size ? I thought of putting 10 ft. or 12 ft. oj
2in. piping on as a chamber. Would it be
sufficient ? —8167.
Without knowing the size of the pump and
air chamber, it would be impossible to esti-
mate what size an extra chamber should be.
If the pressure is 2501 b. when the jetting valve
is closed and it recedes 801 b. when released, it
is delivering at 1701 b. pressure, which is the
amount required for ten-months’ growth. This
variation can be expected, as the opening of the
jetting nozzle will be larger than the opening
of the agitator, which is the only valve open
when the jetting valve is closed.
When is “end to end” weighing resorted to
by the N.S.W. Railway Dept., and what is the
method followed ? Is it an effective method of
weighing a bale of wool ? —BOB7.
“End to end” weighing is resorted to when
the length of a vehicle exceeds the length of
the weighbridge. The vehicle, with its load, is
supported at four small points of contact at
fixed distances from each other. When the
front of the vehicle is weighed, the front
wheels are supported by the weighbridge and
the rear wheels by the ground surface at prac-
tically the same level. When the other end of
the vehicle is on the weighbridge, the front
wheels are on the ground and the distances
between the points of support have not changed,
nor, if the ground is on the same level as the
weighbridge, has the centre of gravity of the
load moved in respect of the supports. The
Railway Department’s experience has been that
for the purpose of calculating the weight of a
vehicle and its contents this method is reason-
ably accurate. It would be difficult, however,
to weigh a bale of wool in the same manner,
as the points of support would probably vary
in dimensional area when the bale was turned
and so result in inaccuracy.
Butter-fat percentage of cream under the old
skim-pah method ? Best of the old gravity
methods of obtaining cream ? —8044.
Cream obtained by the old skim-pan method
seldom contains more than 18 or 20 per cent,
of fat. The percentage naturally varies con-
siderably according to the degree of efficiency
in skimming and other factors, such as time of
holding, temperature, etc. The deep-setting sys-
tem is the best of these old gravity methods.
It consists of putting milk into deep cans imme-
diately after it has been drawn from the cow-.
Then the cans are put into C9M water and
cooled down as near as possible to 55deg.
Fahr. The cream will rise in about 24 hours.
Better results can be obtained if the water is
cooled down to about 40deg. Fahr. with the
use of ice. These gravity methods are very
inefficient compared with mechanical separation,
as losses of fat in the skim-milk of upwards
of .5 per cent, in the shallovy-pan system and
.2 per cent, in the deep-setting system occur,
against only .02 per cent, in mechanical separa-
tion.
“Argee”: Rats won’t look at harness
or any other leather if a little bitter aloes
is mixed with the dubbin. Mix a pint ot
fish oil with an equal weight of mutton
fat, and add a small quantity of bitter
aloes.

sure. The drench is administered by pressing the
control trigger, whereupon the gun is re-charged
simply by releasing the trigger, when a return
spring causes the piston to suck in another charge
of the predetermined amount.
The dose to be administered is regulated by
means of a knurled screwhead at the rear end oi
the gun, and this simple adjustment ensures that
a constant dose is administered to all sheep.
The “Ject-in” Gun is supplied as a complete
outfit in two sizes. The small size is indicated
for use with carbon tetrachloride or tetrachlorethy-
lene, and the dosage ranges from 5 to 10 cubic
centimetres adjustable in steps of one cubic
centimetre. The larger outfit is intended for the
administration of copper sulphate or arsenical
drenches, and is easily adjusted to a dose of either
one or two fluid ounces.

London Wool Sales
The latest series of London wool sales
closed on a firm and hopeful note, quota-
tion generally being par to 15 p.c. higher
than closing rates for the July series—
rather a nebulous and uncertain basis
for the average woolgrower. With jeal-
ousy of the larger and more dominant
market in Sydney, London usually con-
trives to make an official pronouncement
as to prices which evades comparison
with our sturdy local market. But it
may be taken that all crossbreds and
most scoureds (not an important feature
to the generality of woolmen) are dearer
than in our local markets, also lambs’
wool until the recent rise reported in
Sydney for that class of the staple. But
almost all merinos, except the finest
faulty descriptions (a rare specialty), are
definitely cheaper in London than in our
own home-selling centres. This fact, of
course, is due to the Japanese competi-
tion which we command.
* * ••)£ <C
The withdrawals, as they are called
over there (we call ’em passed-in wools),
were fairly heavy, but this is largely on
account of so much of the offerings being
speculators’ lots and parcels reoffered
over their ex-other markets —a perma-
nent feature at London wool sales. Of
the 167,000 bales offered 150,000-odd
were sold; purchases were distributed
approximately 50-50 between Yorkshire
and the Continent, America taking a con-
temptible 2000 or so. Of course, im-
porters of wool into America have to
lift it over a hurdle more than half the
height of the original price. Yorkshire
is always a proportionately larger buyer
in London than out here, owing to the
large selection of Maoriland and South
American crossbreds generally offering
there. Bradford buyers are pretty sure
to get busier again in our Australian
centres now that the London series of
sales has finished.
* * * *
The little less than 40,000 bales held
over in London for future sale is a ridi-
culous proportion when it is considered
how high is the relative quantity of held-
back wool in Australian markets, so
chosen in the interests of orderly and
judicious feeding of demand. The wool
market in London is mainly in the hands
not of the brokers, as out here, but
of an importers’ association, including
Australian exporters, banks, shipping
houses and other odds and ends, who re-
markably subscribe to a policy of offer-
ing everything within sight at the begin-
ning of a series of sales over there. Wool
in the hold of a ship sighted in the
English Channel on the closing days for
a given series is regarded as being in
London stores. London does not fall
into line in the matter of judiciously-
restricted offerings, so we have the ridi-
culous spectacle of a woolgrower who
shears his sheep, say, this month and
ships to London through one or other of
the exporting houses on a 90-day bill
(practically an advance of 70 p.c. of
proceeds free of interest) getting his
clip sold 13,000 miles overseas before he
can get it sold here. The fault is not
with the Australian authorities. They
could offer all wool as it comes in sight,
just as it is done in London, if they were
careless of the results.
The Butter Outlook
“8.5.”: History is repeating itself. In
September, 1932, Australian choicest
salted butter in London, after six
months in the doldrums, reached 107 s.
a cwt. Then a price slide started, and
64s. —a low-price record —was touched
in the first week of April.
* * * *
The same thing is happening again.
Since August a marked improvement had
been registered. High-water mark was
reached during the third week of Sep-
tember, when Australian choicest was
110 s. a cwt. Prices since then have
steadily dropped to 100 s. for Aus-
tralia’s and M.L.’s best brands and 106 s.
for Danish.
* * * *
To find a reason for J. Bull’s pessim-
ism is difficult. Statistically, the market
should be sound. Stocks in Britain on
September 30 were, at 22,000 tons, 800
tons lower than a year ago. Arrivals
that week from all exporting countries
were 5623 tons, a relatively small quan-
tity, though butter en route showed a
definite advance on the previous week’s
figure, and was 82,000 boxes greater than
the quantity 12 months ago. Denmark
may be approaching her second period
of peak production, but her activities are
cramped by a 15s. a cwt. import duty.
* * * *
Australia’s stocks at Sept. 30 were
almost half what they were a year ago,
but M.L.’s supply, at 6270 tons, was
double the total available at the same
date in ’32. Moreover, production in
M.L. has been racing ahead. Heavy
rains in Australia may have influenced
J. Bull’s buyers. They have correctly
assumed that the present leeway of over
40 p.c. on this season’s output will be
THE HAPPY WHEATGROWER.
“My exports are restricted, my bonus is gone, the waggon’s bogged and I’m
out of tobacco. All I want now is another blooming mice plague and I’ll
be set."
overtaken by Christmas. The cause of
J. Bull’s apathy may be found in the
retail-selling price, which the temporary
spurt to 110 s. brought over the Is. mark.
* * * *
For a year Mrs. J. Bull has been paying
for the best Empire butter Is. or under,
but when the price exceeded Is. she either
reduced her weekly buying of butter or
switched over to margarine. The market
is now stagnant, with lower prices anti-
cipated.
* * * *
The immediate effect in Australia of
the overseas weakness is a general re-
duction of the price in all States but
Queensland. Further drops will take
place unless London develops a little
optimism. In N.S.W. the rate is still fd.
a pound above the amount which the
Dairy Produce Export Board thinks can
be realised by butter shipped to London.
The A.D.E. Board is playing into the
hands of M.L. sellers. For the last few
weeks in Australia very little forward
selling has been done. M.L. factories
have known the minimum price fixed by
the board, and have quoted London
houses 2s. a cwt. lower. W. A. Irons,
chairman of the M.L. Dairy Board, is to
meet the Australian board next month
with a view to regulating forward sales
of M.L. butter. Until that is done, there
is nothing to prevent M.L. underselling
Australia on the forward market.
Collapse of Copra
“G. 8.”: South Sea planters are in a
mess. The bottom has fallen out of
their mainstay, the copra market. Not
so long ago copra sold at about £2O a
ton, enabling planters to increase their
plantings. Then the merging of certain
buying interests began to force down the
price, and for the last three years it has
not been above £l5. At the end of
1932 it was just above £l4, and since
then it has sunk steadily to the lowest on
record, £9 ss. to £9 7s. 6d. at last week-
end. These are London prices. The
return to producers is London price less
freight, commission, insurance and other
charges.
* * * *
Rightly or wrongly the soap interests
are mostly blamed for the collapse, but
another factor, the imposition of an
import duty of 355. a ton by France,
developed two months ago. As Mar-
seilles is the most important world
centre for buying and selling of copra
the imposition gives French producers
an advantage over British, Dutch, Ameri-
cans and Australians.
* * * *
World copra production last year was
about 900,000 tons, of which more than
one-third came from Dutch possessions.
The South Seas produced about 167,000
tons, of which New Guinea was respon-
sible for 60,000 tons and Papua for 12,000
tons. A drop of £5 a ton reduces the
earnings of New Guinea by £300,000 and
of Papua by £60,000. Traders, planters
and shipping firms are perturbed, but so
far Canberra has said nothing.
* * * *
Hitler also comes into the picture, By
reducing the German imports by 40 p.c.
he threw nearly 50,000 tons back into the
market. The collapse affects Australia
seriously. It may mean the granting of
heavy subsidies to help New Guinea and
Papua adjust the industry, and it may
affect the butter industry adversely, as
cheap copra means cheap margarine in
Europe.
Honey-marketing
“Larrapinta”: Honey is produced in
hot weather and brings the highest price
in cold. To get the greatest return, stack
and hold it for at least six months. Most
beekeepers cannot do this. They need
money, so they truck their honey to sell-
ing agents quickly. Warehouses become
full of honey, and prices drop. Selling
agents buy in, at their own figure, when
the price drops to its lowest. Then the
winter demand sets in, and they sell at
50 per cent, or more profit. Stocks
dwindle down, and at the end of August
the price rises. Then the man who has
held his crop sells it at a good price.
Many S.A. beekeepers sold first-grade
honey for 10s. a tin during January,
February and March ; they needed the
money. Now the same honey is bring-
ing 18s. to £l.
* * * *
The only way beekeepers can end the
present conditions is to put all of their
take, with the exception of what they
sell direct to private customers in small
lots, into the hands of agents who are
willing to make an advance to them, and
not sell at cut rates.
Wheat Pools
“The Chiel”: In disputing my state-
ment that wheat pools have not resulted
in increased prices to the growers,
“Longo” (B. 11/10/’33) mentions the
Queensland pool, the success of which is
no criterion, as Q. imports wheat. As
my statement applies to the recognised
wheat-producing (i.e., exporting) coun-
tries, it still stands. Many Australian
wheatgrowers are opposed to pools, as
the ballots taken from time to time show.
“Longo’s” jibe at the merchant-con-
trolled market has no foundation. I
am not in the wheat trade, but I do come
into contact with many buyers and their
agents. My opinion is that they would
garrote one another for a farthing a
bushel. I favor increased prices to the
producers, but I fail to see how pools
are going to achieve, them.
Fruit for Export
“Yeb”: The old complaint about Aus-
tralia’s methods of wrapping, branding
and labelling is being heard again.
H. J. S. Vagg, representing Murrum-
bidgee Citrus Growers in London, has
complained that small packers a're send-
ing rough-timber cases and are careless
in packing. He also advises growers to
export only the best-known varieties and
to keep oranges of poor appearance off
the British market. This advice has been
given before. Several visitors to Aus-
tralia, as well as Australians returning
from other countries, have complained
about our packing methods. California
wins all the time because of effective
packing and attractive labelling.
* * * *
It is useless considering a Trade
Commission in Asia if local pro-
ducers do not give it something to sell.
Assistant Minister Jos. Francis has an-
nounced the lifting of M.L.’s embargo
on Australian pineapples. This is good
news for the Minister’s own State,
Queensland, but the citrus-growers of
N.S.W. are still struggling because of
the glut on the local market.
* * * *
Fruitgrowers will welcome the Federal
Government’s grant of £125,000 to assist
the export of apples and pears, but an
attempt by the Government to have
freight and handling charges reduced
would have been of more lasting benefit
to the industry and less burdensome to
the taxpayer. During the last export
season for these fruits —March to June,
1933 —4,328,814 cases of apples and
681,000 cases of pears were exported.

The Picture Gallery
The first picture is that of Aid. C. W.
Campbell, who looks more like Musso-
lini than anybody else in the Brisbane
City Council. He is a sound commercial
member, usually on the side of economy.
Next is J. B. Edwards, M.L.A., who,
since he was elected in 1919, has become
a sort of permanent member for Nan-
ango, a district where they grow good
cattle, good peanuts and maize which
could be used for bullets.
F. A. Cooper is Forgan Smith’s Min-
ister for Public Instruction and Assistant
Treasurer. He qualified for the job by
having no particular financial or educa-
tional experience for longer than almost
anybody of his age in Parliament.
Charles Taylor, a former Speaker, re-
presents an old Queensland custom in
the choice of Parliamentary leaders:
when in doubt choose a produce mer-
chant. There is no training like auc-
tioneering to make a Parliamentary ora-
tor, apparently. Queensland’s most eco-
nomical Premier and Treasurer, Den-
ham and Barnes, both came from Roma-
street, and Taylor made the most digni-
fied and unbiassed occupant of the chair
which the House had known since the
days of John Leahy.

J. B. Edwards, M.L.A.
F. A. Cooper, M.L.A.
Charles Taylor, M.L.A.
E. Costello, M.L.A.
The last in line is Major Costello,
member for Carnarvon, who can claim
to be Australia’s longest legislator.
He makes ordinary politicians look
like pigmies. He came into the
Leg. Assembly just after the war, a
good-humored, capable Digger whom
everybody liked, and it looks as if he
will carry the letters M.L.A. after his
name for the rest of his life.
“Vic”: Touching the report that
Cactoblastis is wiping out the death
adder in the districts where he oper-
ates. Special trains used to be run
to Chinchilla to see the local snake
—yes, there is a good pub in the
place—Abo. writers used to take in the
district as part of their graduate course ;
old-timers on the Barkly used to walk
into strange drovers’ camps and remark:
“I’ll say you’re from Dulacca. I know
it by the way you shake your boots.”
But that is all ended. According to one
local theory the snake, having been de-
prived of pear juice—which contains as
much power alcohol to the square yard
as there is metho. in a Surry Hills cock-
tail—has taken to eating Cactoblastis:
and what the pear’s worst enemy does
to his inside is attested by the fact that
even the collector of the C.S.I.R. board
who used to come all the way from Mel-
bourne to fish for snakes has given up
the pear districts as a bad job. It is
more likely, however, that the wiping out
of the pear has given the local bird life
a chance at snakes and snakes’ eggs.
* * * *
“Eacham”: A conference of public
bodies held at Ravenshoe has just con-
firmed the opinion expressed forcibly by
The Bulletin three months ago that the
North can best be settled by northerners.
It proposes to establish 1865 farms in
the area between Cardwell and Cairns at
an expenditure of £3,000,000, of which
£2,051,000 would be spent on the farms
themselves, with £900,000 on roads and
£lOO,OOO on sundry items. The area
would be served by hydro-electric power
from the Johnstone and the Tully.
The conference further decided that when
it next met at Port Douglas it would
take definite action to formulate a
national developmental scheme for North
Queensland. The Government, however,
does not seem to be enthusiastic. When
the idea was referred for comment to
Pease, Lands Minister, he remarked
coldly that the Government had big
plans of land development for the North
in train, and that “any proposal received
would be referred to the Bureau of In-
dustry for report.”
* * * *
“Old Warden”: The announcement
that the natives of the old Milne Bay
goldfield near Samarai are nowadays suc-
cessful gold fossickers (B. 11/10/’33) will
come as news to many Papuan old-
timers. In the dlays when Milne Bay
and, later, the Gira and Yodda were turn-
ing out a lot of alluvial, the native was
forbidden to mine for the metal, and
the possession of gold was regarded in
much the same light as the holding of a
diamond by a Kaffir or an unlicensed
buyer used to be in Kimberley. There
was a special exemption for the natives
of Sudest, an island in the Louisades, now-
known as Tagula. It was the scene of
one of the early Papuan rushes, and the
local natives picked up the trick of
scraping the slate crevices in the creek
beds for colors. The custom was well
established there by the time the Govern-
ment restrictions were put in force, and,
as the gold was scarce and the island
isolated from the mainland, it was de-
cided to let matters slide. The gold was
sold to local storekeepers, whereas on
the Papuan fields proper colored seller
and white buyer were equally liable to
trouble.
* * * *
“Kuranda”: Further trouble has been
experienced with the site of the power-
house for the Cairns hydro-electric
scheme. It is at the bottom of a steep
hillside, and already four fatalities have
occurred owing to earth coming away.
On three occasions Government inspec-
tors have condemned the site. The latest
is N. J. Amos, chief engineer to the Rail-
way Department, and the Government
has asked the board to suspend opera-
tions until the Amos report has been
considered. This recommends the plac-
ing of the power-house underground, and
it may be the Government will advance
the extra £20,000 required for the change.
* * * *
“X.”: Brisbane City Council was 74
years old on October 13. The first meet-
ing was held in the local police station,
with John Petrie, one of the earliest free
settlers —he put up the windmill on
Wickham-terrace —in the chair. Offices
were then opened in the block between
George-street and where the Victoria
Bridge now stands, and eventually the
Queen-street Town Hall was built in
1864 at a cost of £25,000. It was a far
cry in those days to the time when there
would be a Lord Mayor lodged in pala-
tial quarters and a city public debt of
over £6O per head. What the finances
of the first City Council were like on
its opening day there is no record to
show ; but Sir George Bowen, the pioneer
Governor who inaugurated the colony
in the same year as the council, used to
boast that the Queensland Treasury con-
tained 74d. exactly when he took control.
* * * *
“Mungindi”: After 25 years of exist-
ence the Police Department’s horse-
breeding station at Rewan (C.Q.) is to
be closed. The Queensland Mounted
Police once had the reputation of being
the best mounted force in Australia, and
old-time officers, who were mostly
cavalry-trained, took great pride in the
drilling of their horses. The department
had a keen demand for the Rewan blood
from private buyers, but the trans-
formation of country police from fine
horsemen into Ford owners has changed
conditions seriously. The last four sea-
sons have been so bad that the Govern-
ment thinks it impossible to carry on.
* * * *
“Frigid”: At Samford State school 60
hoop-pine trees have been planted by the
children, and in five years a committee
hopes to plant another 500. These trees,
in 25 years, will, it is hoped, be worth
£3OOO, and proceeds will be used for
scholarships.
* * * *
If there is any man who gives the lie
direct to statements regarding the ability
of white men to work in the Australian
tropics it is George Summers, aged 99,
who, after* a half a century spent in
gold-mining in North Queensland, has
left for the N.T. to inspect an abandoned
gold claim outside Darwin. Born in
England, Summers has been in Australia
for over 70 years. Still hale and hearty,
he is also a remarkable rifle shot.
* * * *
“GG6”: The good rains in Queens-
land have resulted in a super-crop of
blowflies, which are already giving
sheepmen serious trouble, especially in
the south-west. Many graziers are trying
a new type of dressing for struck sheep.
Devised by the N.S.W. Agricultural
Department, it is a paste made by mix-
ing dry ioz. of Paris green with SjOZ.
of kaolin. This is placed in a bottle and
a 2 per cent, solution of soft soap added,
the whole being shaken up. If kaolin
is not available, flour paste can be used.
The dressing is smeared on the wounds
and remains on, being eaten by the
maggots which are unaffected by the
usual contact larvicides.

terest in the child, and is arranging a

purse of sovereigns which Bonnie re-
quires to pave the way. Queensland
Wattle League came forward with £2O.
Bonnie is not the only singer with her
surname whom Queensland is losing.
Mildred Bell, whose ringing contralto
was heard at the opening of our City
Hall in Elgar’s setting of O’Shaughnessy’s
“Music Makers,” and on many occasions
since, has gone to Sydney, where she
may give a recital or two ; and will go
on to London.
You must surf at Coff’s Harbor
(N.S.W.) when travelling on the Kyogle
train. Railway Commissioner Davidson
insists on it. He has promised passengers
a wide choice of “neck-to-knees” to suit
any blonde or brunette. He also declares
that the kettle will be boiling and the
ham sandwich served directly the swim
is over.
Stanthorpe Hospital sent an SOS to
Qantas for urgent need of serum. The
Moth machine sailed into the clouds, and
in little more than an hour the serum
was banded to the hospital authorities.
Kathleen Campbell Brown, a Queens-
land Uni. graduate, is home again. Teach-
ing English to French students occupied
most of her time abroad, but did not
prevent her visiting the International
Conference of Uni. Women in Edin-
burgh.
Silkstone State school scholars have
developed a superiority complex. The
school is the first primary in the State
to have its own motion-picture machine.
At the installation, Minister for Public
Instruction F. A. Cooper gave his
approval, but confessed that the Gov-
ernment had no money to assist the
schools in establishing cinemas. The
film shown dealt with Einstein’s theory
of relativity.
With an English bride, Guy L’Estrange
returned home after four years’ study
abroad. He has followed his father’s
profession—engineering. At the Engi-
neers’ annual conversazione, president
W. M. L’Estrange extended the glad
hand to son and new daughter. Pro-
fessor Goddard came with Mrs. God-
dard, she in golden satin and fur. Pro-
fessor and Mrs. R. W. H. Hawken, H.
B. Fraser and Mrs. Fraser and the J. S.
Justs were also there.
Deuteronomy xxii, 5, “The woman
shall not wear that which pertaineth
unto a man,” was quoted by Captain
W. T. C. Firth just before the Canberra
sailed for the south. Some travellers
objected to two fair passengers appear-
ing on deck in men’s cream trousers.
The captain advised them to go below.
This they declined to do, until the ship’s
Bible and a petition from the other pas-
sengers were produced.
Should all members of the Victoria
League or only the executive meet dis-
tinguished visitors who call this way?
Some of the ladies protested that they
were never privileged to be “among those
present.” So a meeting was held, and
people who had complained were
among the missing. However, after a
little chat, under the tactful guidance of
Mrs. A. E. Moore matters were ex-
plained, and things were put right. It
was decided that, whenever possible,
all members shall be given the chance
to shake hands with the importants.
Before 1934, the District Nursing Asso-
ciation must find £2OO to carry on its
good work. At Lady Wilson’s request,
Mrs. A. E. Moore convened a meeting,
and 60 women each promised to find £2
before the end of December.
Rhoda Felgate produced Reginald
Berkeley’s “Lady with a Lamp” at Cre-
morne Theatre. She got her talent from
the dramatic club of the Girls’ Grammar
O.G.A. Crinolines, the bustle and the
18in. waist made their appearance.
Alexia Drake was the Lady, and played
successfully.
There were bridge and dancing at the
Belle Vue after the Great Public Schools
regatta. They’d all had a good day, with
keen rowing and fair admirers shouting
and waving streamers from the river
bank. The G.P.S. owe a lot to their
patron, Pat O’Shea, and his sister Ella,
who, at the regatta, christened the D. A.
Snelling four-oar boat.
Ever faithful to his beloved Charles
Dickens is Professor Cumbrae Stewart.
He was noticed to slip away from a very
exclusive dinner the other night. He had
a date with the C. D. Fellowship, where
he waxed eloquent on “Martin Chuzzle-
wit.” Ex-Judge Jameson is just as con-
stant, and he was down on the pro-
gramme for a talk about some of the
points in Dickens’s historical novels.

Information Sought.
(1) What system was employed in lowering
the half arches of the Sydney harbor bridge on
to the pin in the centre of the lower chord 7
(2) How many hydraulic jacks were employed 7
—BO9O.
(1) Groups of 128 cables were connected to
the east and west end posts of each half arch
on the north and south side of the harbor.
Each half arch was manned by a squad of six
men under a foreman, whose duty it was to
ensure that the two ends of each cable were let
out simultaneously in equal amounts by his
squad, hydraulic jacks being used. (2) Before
the half arches made contact at the centre, the
cables were let out one at a time by each
squad, two jacks beihg used at each of the four
end posts, i.e., eight jacks in all. Whilst two
jacks were used to let out one cable the other
pair on each side of the harbor were being
fixed in position to release the next cable. After
contact was made two cables were let out at
a time on each side and the eight jacks were
in operation.

(1) Yes. (2) Lady Scott remarried in 1922
and is now Lady Hilton Young; addresses, The
Lacket, Lockeridge, Marlborough, Wilts; and
Leinster Corner, Lancaster Gate, W 2. (3) The

larger ones by arrangement.
Dimensions of the Sydney Cricket Ground
playing arena ? —8262.
Major axis, 174£ yards; minor axis, 152
yards; perimeter, 529 yards. The area is 4
acres 2 roods 10 perches.
(1) A reliable type of insulation for hot-
water pipes running from stove in outhouse to
main building 7 (2) What will it cost 7 —8269.
(1) Use hairfelt strips. A fin. felt is sup-
plied in strips about 4in. wide, each strip 12
yards long. This is bound spirally around the
pipes. In cold districts two thicknesses are
advisable. For the outdoor portion cover the
felt with waterproof canvas. (2) Hairfelt
strips cost about ss. per strip. Cost of covering
depends on size of pipe and of insulation, but
should not exceed Is. per foot.
What is the record rainfall for 24 hours in
Queensland 7 —8232.
’ 35.71 inches, registered at Crohamhurst on
the Blackall Range, south-eastern Queensland,
for the 24 hours ended 9 a.m., February 3,
1893.
(1) If three persons enter into a partnership
in a small way and call it a company, is there
any form or registration that must be gone
through in N.S.W. 7 If so, what and where and
within what time 7 (2) The writer has had 20
years’ experience in the building trade and the
last 10 years has prepared plans and specifica-
tions and used the word "architect” in calling
tenders without any query or protest, but has
recently been told that, not being registered as
an architect, he has no right to do so. Is that
correct 7 —8267.
(1) Every firm carrying on business or having
any place of business under a firm name must
register with the Registrar-General a statement
in writing, signed or acknowledged before him
or a J.P. or barrister or solicitor, containing
firm name, nature of business, place where it is
carried on, full name, usual residence and other
occupation (if any) of the persons carrying it
on and its date of commencement. (2) The
word “architect” where the person has no recog-
nised qualification as such is a misrepresentation
and should not be used.
Is it possible for a private individual to
borrow money on mortgage from the N.S.W.
Government under any unemployment or other
relief scheme for building purposes 7 —‘8339.
Loans in respect of new buildings are re-
stricted to shiali homes in rural areas on land
from which the borrower obtains or proposes
to obtain a living, and are limited to £3OO.
Advances may also be made for the comple-
tion of premises already partly erected, where
the above condition does not exist, upon sub-
mission of plan, specifications and signed
tenders for the work remaining to be carried
out. Apply to Building Relief Committee, De-
partment of Labor and Industry, Sydney.
(1) If a duck flies at a speed of 40 m.p.h.
at right angle to a shooter 50 yards away, how
far must the shooter aim in front of the duck
to hit it, using Noble’s sporting ballistite, No. 3
shot ? (2) Can a wild duck fly 40 m.p.h. ?
8203.
(1) At least a yard ahead of the bird. (2)
Yes. Up to 50 m.p.h.
Is it true that, with the exception of Victoria,
N. S. Wales is the smallest State on the main-
land of A ustralia ? —8042.
Yes. The areas are: W.A., 975,920 sq. m.;
Q’land, 670,500; S. Aus., 380,070; N.S.W.,
300,432; Victoria, 87,884; Tas., 26,215; N.T.,
523,620.
(1) What is legal tender in Australia in silver
and in copper ? (2) Is nickel coinage legal '!
(3) What date was the Mint at Sydney opened
and when was it closed ? —7930.
(1) Silver coin up to 40s. and bronze coin

nickel coins is given in the Commonwealth Coin-
age Act (1909), but none have been minted.
(3) Opened May 14, 1855; ceased to operate on
Nov. 18, 1928.
What was the question on the liquor traffic
put to the people of N.S.W. in 1928 by referen-
dum, and what was the voting ? —7957.

population of Russia? —8319.
(1) and (2) France, Spain, Portugal, Germany,
Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Poland,
Greece, San Marino, Czecho-Slovakia, Finland,
Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia. (3) At Dec., 1931
(latest available figures), 162,143,000.
Apart from gold, what are the chief products
of Australian-controlled New Guinea? —8313.
Cocoanut-growing is by far the most
important, but a fall in prices has been a check
upon it for the time being. Tobacco-leaf of
a high quality has been produced. Cotton is
in the experimental stage, and some headway
has been made with the growth of cocoa, coffee
and rubber.
Is there any record of the first British-built
vessel constructed in Australia ? —7855.
The first was a hoy, called The Rose Hill
Packet, built in Sydney Cove and launched on
Oct. 5, 1789. She was sailed between Sydney
and Rose Hill (Parramatta) and elsewhere
about the harbor, the building of vessels for
ocean service being then prohibited by the
British Government. The first deep-sea vessel
built in Australia was the Cumberland, 28 tons,
schooner, in 1800.
What is a “blue-stocking” and how did the
term originate ? —8357.
A term applied to ladies of learning and
literary accomplishments; especially those who
air their erudition in a pedantic manner. It
derives from the fact that in 1750 a literary
circle was established in London consisting of
ladies and gentlemen, among whom was Mr.
Benjamin Stillingfleet, who regularly wore blue
stockings. The term has been adopted in
France and Germany.
(1) Method of making lime plaster and apply-
ing it to mud-brick and cement-brick walls ? (2)
Could superphosphate be mixed with the lime ?
If so, in what proportion ? —7912.
(1) It is prepared by slaking stone lime and
mixing with three to four parts of sand. Cow
hair is used as a binder. The walls must be
brushed free from dust and wetted before apply-
ing the plaster. Country reference section of
Public Library, Macquarie-street, Sydney, will
supply books on the subject. (2) So far as is
known the experiment has never been tried.
(1) Is there a market for shark oil? (2)
Name of a buyer, and approximate price per
gallon ? (3) Any market for shark fins ? (4)
Any market for shark hide, salted and bibled ?
—8292.
(1) Yes, but only for oil extracted by steam
from perfectly fresh livers, and filtered at a
low temperature to extract the stearine. (2)
James Hardie Trading Co., 378 Kent-street,
Sydney. About 2s. 6d. per gallon. (3) Wing
On and Co., 10 Ultimo-road, Sydney, will pur-
chase shark fins at about 2s. 6d. per pound.
(4) Not in Australia. Try Ocean Leather Co.,
Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A.
(1) What is the “body-scissors” with which
Tom Lurich beats so many wrestlers at Leich-
hardt, Sydney ? (2) How is a “hammer-lock”
put into operation ? —8435.
(1) It consists of circling an opponent’s body,
preferably across the stomach, with both legs,
locking the feet and squeezing until he sub-
mits to a fall. (2) You secure your opponent’s
wrist with both hands, pull the wrist behind
him, and pull or push it up to his shoulder-
blades. The pain then becomes so intense that,
unless able to escape, he will surrender.
Has a licensed fisherman the same camping
rights in N.S.W. non-tidal waters as he has in
tidal waters ? —8305.
A fishing license confers no right other
than that of catching fish for sale. No
person is entitled to trespass on private
property for camping or fishing, except by
permission of the landholder, but generally
speaking the same conditions apply to camping
and other reserves contiguous to inland (non-
tidal) waters as to those fronting tidal waters.
What duty is payable on caladium bulbs im-
ported from India ? —8294.
The bulbs are free of ordinary duty, but sub-
ject to 10 p.c. primage duty and 6 p.c. sales
tax. Admission is subject to a permit being
received from the Chief Quarantine Officer,
Plants; Branch, Department of Agriculture,
Sydney* '
Is there a market for ringed yellow box
timber in limited quantities ? It has a grain
similar to ringed gidya, but is paler in color.
8265.
Likely buyers are H. Goldman, Ltd., Chapel-
street, South Yarra, Vic.; A. J. Wiley, 57 Puls-
ford-road, Prospect, S.A.; S. Horton, c/o
E.S.C.A., Brisbane; and B. F. Kruger, 12 Scott-
street, Red Hill, Brisbane. The Q’land Forest
Service, Brisbane, may be needing supplies of
this timber in the near future.
I have a plantation of about 13,000 Pinus
pinaster, and propose to produce turpentine.
Can the thinnings be used in a digester, and
•where can I obtain books on the subject? —
8274. , .
Perth Public Library and the library of the
W.A. Forest Service contain various textbooks
and technical bulletins on the subject, but your
plantation is far too small to make turpentine
production profitable. Thinnings cannot be
heated in a digester in any save the very largest
of plants.
Is it possible for one anxious to make a
sacrifice and help suffering humanity to get a
position on a leper station in Australia 7—8301.
There are leper stations at Sydney, Brisbane
and Darwin. At each of these it is the practice
to engage trained assistants. There are no open-
ings for persons without special qualifications,
and as the risks to attendants, under modern
methods of treatment, are small, there is no
call for volunteers with special qualities of
heroism and devotion.
1 ant thinking of starting a registry office
in Vic. (1) Is any guarantee bond necessary ?
(2) Is firm registration necessary? (3) What

(1) No. (2) Not necessary if business car-
ried on under own name. (3) Forms of appli-
cation are obtainable from the Department of
Labor, Melbourne, Vic. (4) Fee varies accord-

Melbourne, will give you full details of regula-
tions affecting the business.
Was there ever a toll-bar in George-street
abdut where Marcus Clark’s is to-day ? Was
it there in 1883? When was it demolished ?
8237.
A toll-house gate was erected in 1819, close
to the site of the present tram waiting-shed in
Railway-square, opposite the premises of Marcus
Clark. It was removed in 1837 to a spot near
Grose Farm and the toll-house was* then con-
verted into a lock-up. Date of its demolition
is a matter for research. Consult Mitchell
Library, Sydney.
(1) Wheyi did the 46/fi ( South Devon ) Regi-
ment first come to Sydney ? (2) In what ship ?
(3) Where were its headquarters in Britain
situated ? —8270.
The regiment arrived at Sydney on February 7
and 11, 1814, in the ships General Hewitt and
Windham. From 1794 to 1811 the entire regi-
ment was in the West Indies. In that year it
returned to England and in 1812 moved to
Jersey. In August, 1813, it embarked for N. S.
Wales, and during its period of service its head-
quarters were in Sydney. The “Sydney
Gazette” of February 12, 1814, announced the
arrival of “the headquarters of the 46th Regi-
ment, commanded by Lieut.-Col. Molle, who
succeeds Col. O’Connell as Lieut.-Governor of
this Territory.”
(1) Method of preparing saltpetre ? (2) How
are the chlorides removed ? (3) Any simple
method of doing this ? (4) Composition of
commercial Chili saltpetre ? (5) Name of a
book on the nitrate industry? —Bl32.
(1) and (2) It is prepared in large quantities
from Chili saltpetre. Concentrated solutions of
Chili saltpetre (sodium nitrate) and potassium
chloride are mixed and heated, saltpetre
(potassium nitrate) and common salt (sodium
chloride) being formed. The. chloride is
separated out in the form of crystals when the
solution cools, while the saltpetre remains in
solution. (3) Do not know of any. (4) As
exported: Sodium nitrate, 95 p.c.; sodium
chloride, 2 p.c.; sulphate, 0.6 p.c.; insoluble
matter, 0.1 p.c.; moisture, 2.3 p.c. (5) “The
Nitrate Industry,” by Enrique Cuevas, published
by W. S. Myers, New York.
(1) According to a statement ( B. 4/10/’33)
Japan has 600 military ’planes. Do these in-
' elude hydroplanes ? (2) What would be Japan’s
striking capacity with her army in case of in-
vasion of a distant overseas country ? —8389.
(1) These include everything that is effective,
including naval aeroplanes, apart from a few
squadrons now in course of construction. (2)
Not a question to be answered offhand. You
will find a full summary of the position in
M. H. Ellis’s “The Defence of Australia,” En-
deavour Press (Is. 6d.).
(1) To whom was Johann Strauss (1825-1899)
married ? (2) Were the famous waltzes scored
for full orchestra by him, or did he write them
for a single instrument, such as the piano ?
(3) What operas and operettas did he write ?
(4) Where may biographies of Strauss and other
musicians be obtained ? —8404.
(1) He married Henriette Treffz, a singer, in
1862, and after her death, in 1878, he married
Angelica Dittrich, also a singer. (2) Both the
Johann Strausses, father and son, were
orchestral conductors, and their waltzes and
other compositions were scored for orchestra.
(3) Strauss the younger wrote the operettas “In-
digo und die vierzig Rauber,” “Der Karneval in
Rom,” “Die Fledermaus,” “Prinz Methusalem,”
“Cagliostro,” “f>as Spitzentuch der Konigin”
and “Die lustige Krieg.” (4) Any of the big
booksellers will give you a lengthy list.
About 50 years ago a volcanic eruption
caused the sun to appear blue at sunset in
places along the Equator. What were the cir-
cumstances ? —8234.
In August, 1883, a series of volcanic explo-
sions occurred in the Sunda Strait; Krakatoa
mountain was completely blown away, leaving
a cavity 1000 ft. deep, and the contour of the
strait was changed for many miles. The dark-
ness caused by clouds of smoke, ashes and mud
was so great that at Batavia, 100 miles distant,
lamps were lit at midday. It was estimated
that dust, stones and mud were projected to a
height of 17 miles. But far above these the
finer particles and sulphurous gases were car-
ried westward by atmospheric currents, spread-
ing also north and south, and reaching in a few
weeks all round the world. Unnoticeable dur-
ing the day, they produced a wonderful effect
at sunset, the sun itself appearing of various
strange colors, blue, green, coppery, etc. This
curious phenomenon was remarked everywhere
within 30 to 40 degrees from the Equator.

THE PALETTE
The Rookwood Gallery—there is, to
Sydneyites, a cemetery ring about the
title—was added to Melbourne’s cultural
heritage lately. It is at 361 Collins-street,
and is to be a permanent fixture where
all or any schools of Australian art can
argue their merits with the public.
Painters contributing are John Longstaff,
Louis McCubbin, Frate, Shore, H. B.
Harrison, George Bell and a flock of
others. A. D. Colquhoun stands out
with a brilliant study of ranunculi, and
Amalie Colquhoun, his wife, runs him
a close second with an admirable por-
trait of Mr§. M. Fricke. George Bell
hangs a portrait which fails to convey
much of the personality of Daryl Lind-
say. Ola Kohn shows some of her
Epsteinian sculpture.
Most of Noel Counihan’s pencil por-
traits, which fill the Soho Galleries, Mel-
bourne, with reminiscences of the styl-
istic graces of the late George Lambert,
are polite, especially that of Gengoult
Smith. The artist lets himself go in
caricaturing himself and some fellow-
artists. There is a ferocious libel on
James Flett.
Woodward-Smith, the young artist
with the gift for mural decorations, was
escorting 20 or more girls from the Syd-
ney finishing school known as Doone
across to Arlington, Mrs. Rodney Dan-
gar’s house, to show them the tropic
fish wall-painting with which he had just
finished decorating one of the rooms.
The crocodile took a short cut down a
lane and found itself suddenly stream-
ing on to the lawn of a rather imposing
house from whose balcony a lady re-
garded them with the frown of surprise.
In answer to her rather tense inquiry the
damsels’ shepherd explained they were
taking a short cut. The lady, still in
tense and aloof tones, replied there was
no short cut —they were on private pro-
perty. The crocodile thereupon with-
drew. At a dinner party some days
later, up Mudgee way, a friend of Wood-
ward-Smith’s told the story of the irate
lady and the Patience Chorus to his
neighbor. At the end where the hearty
laugh was indicated, she replied coolly,
“Yes, I know all about that—l was the
irate lady.”
M j ss A M E Bale and yj ct0 r Cobb
between them have pegged out the Mel-
bourne Athenaeum claim to public con-
sideration. Miss Bale is an earnest
worker in oils who paints flowers with
a feminine sensitiveness to their charm
and gives them almost (if not quite
enough) air to breathe. “Iceland Pop-
pjes” and “Zinnias” are two delicate
examples of her art. Etcher Cobb is
before all else an illustrator who seeks
the obviously picturesque, though in
“Redmond Barry’s Old House” (which
was also Melbourne’s first library), and
in “Winter’s Nocturne, Prince’s Bridge,”
he strikes true artistic form,
The spring show of S.A. Society of
Arts has a lot of good work. Hans Hey-
sen pu ts j n one G f bis Centralian studies
—desolate hills looking like a moon land-
scape. His daughter Nora deserts flowers
for heads, including a self portrait;
President Leslie Wilkie, on the other
hand, now adds flowers to his graceful
portraits. The younger figure-painters
have little enthusiasm for grace, and
sacrifice other things to strength. In
landscape, Will Ashton’s snow on a
Kosciusko farm is outstanding Adelaide
Art Gallery has bought three seascapes—
Nambucca, by Roy Parkinson (Q.),
Wattamulla, by W. R. Johnson (N.S.W.),
and George Whinnen’s cliffs outside the
Murray mouth. For the three annual
prizes, open to local members only, the
judges, Dora Wilson and Marie Tuck,
preferred another seascape of Whinnen’s,
a dead-tree landscape by Gwen Barringer
(who has greatly improved of late), and,
for the Melrose portrait award, the afore-
said study of and by Nora Heysen.

ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week s salary, it won t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one weeks
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The Governor and his lady held court
on Saturday night, and nearly 200 guests
bobbed the knee in obeisance after being
scrutineered by aides Royce Shannon
and Lieut.-Commander Gifford. The
ballroom was the scene of inaction,
everyone sitting motionless to breathless-
ness while Athos Martelli served Popper
and Becker from a suave and golden ’cello,
and Elsie Findlay and Domenico Caruso
sang Purcell and Schumann, Puccini and
Verdi. The rooms qnd the entrance hall
were brilliant with azaleas, velvety roses
and pelargoniums, and subtly woven into
the color composition were Lady Game’s
pale pink gloves and pink chenille-em-
bossed chiffons. Rosemary Game and
Rosemary Budge handed out the pro-
grammes impartially to all-comers, one of
the most decorative being the wife of
Japan’s Consul-General in her national
dress carried out in tones of mauve.
Italy was represented by the Consular
Ferrantes, the tall Marchesa very hand-
some in flowing white satin. Hubert
Murray’s lady was distinguished in rasp-
berry-red and white chevron-striped
crepe. Belgium’s Consul-General-squired
daughter Sophie, who wore cape and
frock of deep delphinium-blue. Lido-blue
was chosen by Mrs. Walter Swinson and
by Miss Macarthur Onslow ; Mrs. A. C.
Godhard warmed her backless frock with
an ermine cape ; Mrs. Harry Budge was
there with Elise and Sadie ; Mrs. Arthur
Scrivener wore rose satin ; poetess Mary
Gilmore, Mrs. John Barlow and Mrs.
Mac Nicol were among the shifting
groups at suppertime ; Mrs. Ellis Field-
ing Jones was a graceful argument for
the wearing of black ; Mrs. Sterling Levis
had puffs of white orgqndie finishing the
sleeves of her black velvet; Mrs. E. Play-
fair was a good-looker wrapped in
ermine; and Mrs. Sep. Levy, with her
pompadour hairdressing and her black
lacquered lace frock, with its butterfly
bows at the waist and the back of the
neckline, was one of the belles of the
evening.
This is jubilee year for Sydney High
School, and its old boys and girls are
running their celebrations neck to neck.
There isn’t one tick of difference in the
ages of the now-separate schools, for
even as the Ark housed male and female
of the species, so did the original old
High in Elizabeth-street accommodate
girls and boys. In those days the girls
were on the first floor, the boys on the
ground. Both ate their commemoration
dinners in David Jones’s restaurant,
which rises as near as can be above the
school yard where the famous old fig-
trees grew.
Among the great muster of old boys
at the dinner was Arthur Eedy, whose
name is the first on the schooPs register.
Others whose association with High goes
back to the beginning of things were A. B.
Piddington, K.C., one of the school’s
early masters, Grammar’s head Dett-
mann, the school’s own head Saxby
(another first boy), Director of Educa-
tion Thomas and Gus Blair, the owner
of Chatham. The school, of course, has
had its Smiths ; three brothers of them,
in fact: S.H., former Director of Educa-
tion, Dr. S.A. and the famous Grafton
Elliott Smith. Acting Judge Neild, Dr.
Oscar Diethelm and The Bulletin’s
H. K. Prior were other celebrants who
paid respects to the Pierian spring at the
old address.
Girls will be girls, so, of course, when
the “old girls” of Sydney High had their
jubilee beano there was continuous talk
set to the tune of “Do you remember?”
Five hundred of the O.G.U. (which num-
bers such well-known names as Ethel
Turner and Louise Mack) rolled up, and
among the speakers were academic Miss
Mallarky, school principal Florence
Campbell, Mrs. R. R. S. Mackinnon
and Mrs. W. G. State, who brought
with her a basket of leaves and
figs which she had gathered from a tree
grown from a slip of the old leafy king
of the school grounds. Greetings from
first principal Mrs. Lucy Garvin, now in
England, put an extra dash of fragrance
into the potpourri.
Mars brought a smiling visage to the
United Service Ball. This filled the ball-
room of the Wentworth with the glitter of
uniform and decoration, with the murmur
of chiffon and silk and organdie, and
both had for background the white ensign
from the old Australia and the blue flag
of the Air Force. This last was in compli-
ment to Sir Philip Game, who was brave
in his Air Force uniform, while Lady
Game was festive in chiffons embossed
in roseate chenille. The Bertie Lloyds
brought a deb., pretty June Lloyd, who
wore gleaming white crepe and wreathed
her tresses in white velvet flowers for
her presentation to vice-royalty. Philip
Game came in the Government House
group; so did the departing Bishop
Radford and Mrs. Radford. Barbara
Holmes, of Bathurst, looked fresh as a
field flower in besprigged muslins with a
waist knot of blue ribbons. Brig.-Gen.
Lloyd and Mrs. Lloyd were among the
entertainers, she in dignified violet chif-
fons. Brig.-Gen. O. F. Phillips, the
Mayoral Hagons, the Naval Popes, her
laces being a seductive caramel-brown,
Brig.-Gen. Heritage and many more were
gathered around the official board, which
was massed with red flowers, and orna-
mented by a gong made from a shell of
1914-18 design, an honored relic of the
United Service Institution’s museum.
Mrs. A. C. Godhard was in London
when the Birthday honors were given out,
so she went up to Buckingham Palace for
the ceremony. The King himself hung
on her 0.8. E. At these Palace investi-
tures the K.C.M.Gs., K.Bs., 0.8.E5. and
D.B.Es. aren’t mixed indiscriminately.
Eadh is rounded up by a nice, courteous
but firm chamberlain into his or her
company, and presently another affable
attendant comes around and deco-
rates each with what the Girl in the Flat
Opposite describes as “the order of the
picture hook,” on which the gaud will
hang. Then when royalty and the re-
cipient are face to face, all the King has
to do is to connect hook and decoration.
There is scarcely a welfare movement in
Sydney that has not known Mrs. God-
hard’s helping hand. Falk made the
picture.
The ballroom at vice-regal headquarters
was crowded the other morning when
the idea of the Governor’s ball was dis-
cussed and decided upon. At this Sir
Philip and Lady Game will represent
Governor and Mrs. Macquarie, while
Bligh, King, Brisbane, other Governors
and their little courts will live again in
their Australian descendants. Sam
Walder and his lady will come to the
party as the first Mayor and Mayoress
of Sydney. W. C. Wentworth is chair-
man of the committee, and the Pioneers,
the Women Pioneers and the Historical
Society are adding their weight to make
the affair a spectacular and monetary
success. The District Nurses will garner
the golden sheaves.
As a youngster lima Barnes had the
privilege of working in several Oscar
Asche cos., and from Oscar she caught
the glamor of fine words beautifully
spoken. Miss Barnes, who had a good deal
of experience with the 8.8. C., graduated
with a scholarship in dramatic art at the
Royal Academy, London, and, in addi-
tion to her solo work, specialises in the
training of verse choirs. Some impres-
sive examples of her methods will be
heard in the Masque of poetry and dance
at the Savoy next Tuesday evening. Fiona
Macleod’s lovely “Moonchild,” to which
Miss Barnes has written a haunting
choric melody, will be one of the gems of
the evening.
Laughter that started in a giggle had
swelled to a guffaw long before Lady
Game declared the Ladder to Fame ex-
hibition open. Her own teddy bear and
John Lane Mullins’s blue cow on a pink
coral strand were among the rib-ticklers,
but that was the hall-mark of their suc-
cess ; in this Mad Hatter’s art show your
achievement was gauged by the laughter
your attempt evoked. Here was no
hanging space for real artists —only ama-
teurs, people who had never painted
before. Alexander Gordon’s lady had
set the whole thing going as a finan-
cial force-pump for the coffers of the St.
John Ambulance Association. Dorothy
Brunton and Madge Elliott dipped into
the make-up pots and painted their mas-
terpieces between acts. Cissie Walker’s
“Kitchen Melody,” painted with starch,
blue and cocoa, and “Giff’s” self-portrait
were entertaining entries.
The crowd at the opening was enor-
mous. All the entrants arrived supported
by friends. Mrs. A. T. Anderson brought
daughter Mrs. Foott, who is over
from Melbourne; Miss Mary Fairfax
was noted in the vicinity of her own
magnolias ; Alexander Gordon stood and
from afar off watched his small wife as,
clothed in brown marocain and vivacity,
she escorted her State Ex. from flower
to flower, while small Rosemary Game
gambolled in the same meadow. The
vice-reine’s speech was witty as regards
the efforts of the painters courageous,
and pretty as to the services of the
organiser and St. John’s own Sister Parry,
who had painted her street accident in
iodine. Off-stage Mrs. Victor White and
Mrs. Walter Brunton did big business in
their gift shop, and this Letter particu-
larly liked the gay lacquered field flowers
that wreathed the crown of Mrs. C. L.
Jones’s black shiny straw hat.
Charity workers seized the psycho-
logical moment for a ball that was a
welcome-home to the tennis reps, and a
lift for the Tresillian Homes. The entry
of Jack Crawford and his wife into
David Jones’s ballrom was the night’s
crescendo, and hundreds craned the neck
of curiosity as Australia’s champion
player and his good-looking wife
passed from the lift to the official table.
Mrs. Crawford’s frock was long, white
and trig of outline ; a dash of scarlet
geraniums in the vicinity of the right
shoulder was a pictorial triumph. In the
hand was carried a red chiffon lace-
edged kerchief that would have aroused
envy in a Regency belle. Tennis presi-
dent Frank Peach’s wife also favored red,
and was enfolded in flat crepe of this
cheerful hue. The Mayoral Hagons came
to the party ; so did Mr. and Mrs. Craw-
ford, senior, the medical Ludowicis, the
Butters knight and his lady.
Mrs. Bonney, Queensland’s intrepid
little airwoman, whose flight to England
added another leaf to Australia’s flying
crown, arrived in Sydney last week fresh
and fit and full of determination to keep
on flying. Strangely enough, it was not
the sea but mountain flying that made her
feel nervous. Mrs. Bonney arrived by
the Otranto with her wings. “My Little
Ship,” in which she made her flight
around this continent before the Aus-
tralia-to-England adventure. A proud
husband was at the boat to meet her.
One hundred and ten sat down to the
A.l.M.’s 21st birthday tea-party in the St.
Andrew’s Cafe last week. Later, in the
Assembly Hall, 700 listened to padre
Kingsley Partridge’s account of his jour-
neys with A.I.M. wireless expert Tregear
which took them to Groote Eylandt, and
wherever the mission wireless sets are in
operation. The A.I.M. spreads a wide
net; at present its flying doctor, whose
headquarters are at Cloncurry, is being
relieved by Dr. Odium from Mosman.
Once a year the business girls of the
Kooroora Club entertain men —chiefly
their employers—at Farmers’ restaurant.
They give them a good lunch, pay for it
and exact only a speech or two from
selected victims. Dr. Maguire, Shell Oil’s
T. Nicholson and W. H. Ifould held
forth at the latest affair of the kind,
and everything passed off pleasantly,
except that Mr. Ifould, as he manfully
acknowledged, sat on an apple pie,
cream and all.
Great pageantry surrounded the crown-
ing of Gretel Bullmore as this year’s Rose
Queen. For weeks past the war of the
roses in the interests of the Industrial
Blind Institution in William-street had
kept a number of nominee queens on
their toes to snare votes for their par-
ticular emblems. When the final ballot
had been taken Lady Game placed the
crown on Rosa Verdiflora, while Golden
Emblem, Rose Doree, Sunny South and
Snow Queen hoped for better luck next
year. White-and-green-clad heralds an-
nounced the entry of each competitor
on the Town Hall stage, which was all
dolled up as a garden. Then each group
in their graceful raiment, the colors of
the bloom they represented, circled the
hall between garlands of flowers held
by small citizens dressed in the Kate
Greenaway and Watteau styles.
Sydney’s luxury trams wear a cream
and green make-up with a slight but not
as yet emphasised powdering of local
dust. There are still so few of them that
the populace stands at gaze as they
approach. They are corridor in design,
and each little leather-padded seat is in-
tended to hold two citizens of average
dimensions. How the conductor will col-
lect the fares when there’s a cargo of out-
sizes with curves flowing out into the
aisle has yet to be shown. The new
models offer two advantages to the sex
—the step-in is easy, and there’s so little
noise connected with the running that
women can and do keep a conversation
going from Erskine-street to Watson’s
Bay without straining the larnyx. These
trams have had their pictures in the paper,
they have been interviewed, and some
say that the Tramway Commissioners
have allotted them a special valet to rug
them in silk every night.

Chatter
The V.A.T.C. unchained its turnstiles
for the opening spring meeting, the Caul-
field Guineas. Women punters wouldn’t
risk losing the stiffening from their care-
fully-planned new turnouts and smart-
ened up the stands in the tailored manner.
Mrs. A. V. Hiskens sat next to Mrs.
Ronald Irving in the committee cubby-
hole. Mrs. Len Buxton, in a sumptuous
snow-leopard collar, had interests in the
saddling paddock; she was with Mrs.
Neunhoffer. Mrs. Ben Chaffey and her
sister, Miss Macpherson, strolled about
together. Mrs. Dudley Brunton was
dashing in black. A tuft of monkey fur
sprouted from Mrs. Edric Henty’s hat;
she is still unpacking her foreign-labelled
trunks. Mrs. Alan Robinson kept a blue
coat over a red frock. Mrs. Hart and
Mary were there, the former in checked
tweeds. Margot Rosenthal wore a re-
markable hat like a plate. Her mother
was smart in an oatmeal suit and a
black satin blouse. A butterfly bow went
hand-in-hand with the black suit worn by
Mrs. Lawrence Rentoul, who has just
returned from her honeymoon. Mrs.
Gilder peeped at the grey sky through her
tulle hat brim. Mrs. McCall-McCowan
looked nice in fog-grey flecks and a
blue hat.
Betty Shadkell burst the chrysalis of
her school-days to emerge an all-white
deb. Wings of organdie sprouted in the
newest fashion from her shoulders and
floating sash-ends were attached to the
waist of her moulded garment. Other
debs, who flew forth on the same spring
evening were Pat Lyon, in pearl-white
satin ; Betty Black, in ivory crinkly crepe,
and Enid Thompson, in a bubble of
tulle. The Harold Shackells—the hostess
with the perfume of lily of the valley
arising from the shoulder-spray pinned to
her green gown—gave the party at Gros-
venor. Here glow-worm lamps spattered
drops of color in the shrubby garden and
mounds of gladioli and snapdragons made
pinky splashes within. The Baillieu clan
was well represented among the guests.
Some of the Winter-Irvings were there,
also Lennon Raws and his lady, Arthur
Robinson and his lady, a sprinkling of
Symes and Mackinnons and lots of pretty
things like Valerie Purves, Lynette Dick-
enson and the youthful Outhwaites.
Gwen Thomas, Joan Gardiner and
Margaret Knight coo-eed their young
friends to a frolic at Grosvenor. The
lassies, all on the verge of 21, were
schoolmates of their hostesses at Toorak
College. The colors of their Alma Mater
were hoisted in flowers and ribbons over
the buffet. Miss Thomas’s fairness was
set off by a trained gown of Zulu-brown
ninon, and in frilly chiffon Miss Gardner
looked like the froth on a strawberry
squash. Miss Knight, a brunette, was
dashing in orange velvet with a cape of
black-and-orange taffetas. Louise Cullen,
Helveta Marsden, Mary and Ruth Russell
and Ethel Beck were among the merry-
makers.
Frank Clarke and his lady gave a six-
o’clock-onwards cocktail party at their
South Yarra stronghold. After Cup
Week they go to Macedon. The hostess
spoke her welcomes in a navy coat over
a frock of a paler shade of blue. Her
daughter, Mrs. John Oldham, wore Swiss-
blue ninon. The Murdoch knight and
his lady, Molly Finlay and the John
Turnbulls were among the guests.
The Stirling Paterson couple mixed a
late-afternoon cocktail at the fashionable
No. 9. The Darling-street mansion dis-
played a cheery interior to guests who
took a flying leap across a wet and muddy
pathway. Golden broom, watsonias and
tulips were bunched in the reception
rooms and from small tables dotted
about sprung lupins among pink carna-
tions. Mrs. Patterson kept the chill from
her patterned crepe frock with a dark-
blue coat. Her sister, Mrs. David Jame-
son, wore a chilli-red hat with her pebble
black-and-white suit. The . Arthur
Robinsons, the Stuart Murrays, Sena-
tor and Mrs. R. D. Elliott and the
George Dicksons were among those who
passed savories to one another. Host
and hostess are from Scotland. Before
returning there in April they plan to have
a peep at the Apple Isle and Maoriland.
Young horsewoman Mary Bright roped
in 40 of her pupils to provide spectators
with a worth-while display—a gymkhana,
which is an annual event, held at Franks-
ton, for Toorak College. Mildred
McArthur scooped the pool for flat and
hurdle events and bending and ball races.
The girls, very snappy in their boots and
breeks, voted the day a tremendous thrill.
Tea was a happy interlude, for a nippy
wind worked up healthy appetites for
riders and onlookers. Mrs. Bright made
a brew for a large party at her house.
Moira Bryans and Hubert Black cast
off their matrimonial ship at St. John’s,
Toorak. In her wedding garment the
bride achieved a blend of modern and
old-world styles. Fashioned of ivory
crepe, it fitted snugly to the neck with a
collarette qf orange-blossom. Buttons
ran down the back of the corsage and a
ruffle edged the hem of the skirt. A short
tulle veil fluttered over the rope of buds
and blossoms attached to the bride’s wrist.
Her sister Barbara and ’groom’s sister
Judy followed in a cloud of organdie, the
whiteness of which was sprinkled with
pastel flowers. Their picture hats were
swathed with blue taffeta. Mr. and Mrs.
M. H. Baillieu lent their mansion for the
afternoon reception.
Trams rumbling past St. Kilda Town
Hall disgorged large contingents of
passengers at the garden gate of that
handsome edifice. Star turns at the Wild
Nature Show within were a carpet snake
wrapped in a trance, a little lizard, which
his owner vows has not eaten a bite for
four months, a beetle that somehow got
himself pickled in a lump of gum and a
stuffed platypus. Cockatoos shrieked and
little lovebirds cuddled up together. In
the zoo section a bandicoot was lapping
bread-and-milk as if he hadn’t had a
feed for a week. The geological people
proudly displayed their chunks of rock
crystal. The marine-minded had a room
to themselves full of alcohol-smelling
test tubes. In the abo. corner were fish-
nets woven by black brother in the Gulf
country. He believes that snakes taught
his ancestors to catch fish and so, in
gratitude, weaves a snaky pattern into
the mesh.
Herewith a Jack Cato glimpse of Aileen
Dent, a National Gallery graduate who
has done good work in portraiture and
landscape. She has three canvases in the
Women Painters’ Show at the Athenaeum.
One of her portraits is at the Alfred
Hospital, which cherishes her limning of
Hamilton Russell. Priminister Lyons,
scurrying backwards and forwards
between Canberra and the Apple Isle,
finds time to visit Miss Dent’s studio,
where his portrait is nearing the stage
at which the artist stands twelve feet away
with eyes half-closed, poising a very long
brush like a spear, and decides that a
spot of sepia in the corner of the mouth
wouldn’t do anybody any harm.
Postmen are leaving the Lud Mayor’s
latest batch of invitations on top of letter-
boxes. The decorative parchment mea-
sures 12in. by Bin. Its frontispiece is a
replica of an old engraving depicting
ladies and gentlemen tripping a measure
in a moonlit garden.
A lightning artist thrown as a bait
under the portico of the Town Hall
caught the crowd with his flourishes of
black paint on white paper. Hesitating
feet were lured up the steps by an
attendant togged up as Aladdin, and a
dance band got them past the ticket-
window. Within was a fashion-and-
beauty display. The woman with lots of
self-assurance could have her locks waved
and the flapper her eyebrows plucked and
face done up in her favorite orange or
raspberry free of charge and under the
eyes of the public. Mannequins strolled
across the dais, and surf girls had a
pocket handkerchief of beach'on which
to display their marine accessories.
A Broothorn camera made this picture
of Dorothy Harland, secretary of the
Country Women’s Association. Miss
Harland’s enthusiasm and sound business
training have enabled her in her year of
office to solidify the organisation’s
finances. Branches are springing up over-
night, 26 infant centres having been born
since last April. The C.W.A. is non-
sectarian and non-political, it raises funds
by. co-operative efforts and it brings coun-
try women into social touch.
Elaine Claire Blogg, of Toorak, just
back from the other side of the world,
announces her engagement to an Eng-
lishman. He is E. V. Rouse, whose
parents hail from Ashworth in Yorkshire.
Jean, second daughter of the Rev. and
Mrs. J. E. Warren, of Elsternwick, is
betrothed to the Rev. A. Crooks Hull.
Adelaide’s social affairs:
The E.S.U.’s annual recording merged into a
supper party. Small tables were covered with
pale-green cloths and adorned with silver bowls
of rose-pink ranunculi. The president of the
union (Dr. C. E. Duguid) and his wife, the lady
in black ring velvet, received the guests. Mrs.
Mellis Napier (president of the hospitality com-
mittee) sported pale-green chiffon velvet. Clif-
ford Lathlean sang.
On an afternoon in the same week the E.S.U.
gave an afternoon tea at the Bohemian Cafe to
welcome home Mayoress Glover, the tables
being decked with Lorraine Lee roses. Dr. and
Mrs. Robert Kellem, of Los Angeles, were
among the guests. Mrs. Glover, who looks
remarkably well after her trip to England, wore
a navy tailored coat with a stone-marten fur
and a Bangkok straw hat.
Their Exes, attended the Toe H dance at St.
Peters’s Town Hall, and were received by Mayor
and Mayoress Perry, of St. Peters. Lady Hore-
Ruthven wore flesh-colored satin and a black
ring velvet coatee. Mrs. Perry was in beige
satin and lace.
Old girls of the Wilderness School held a
garden party in the school grounds. Mrs.
Brown, the original headmistress (her daughters
now carry on the seminary), is 99, and she held
quite a reception.
Margaret, elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.
A. Edmunds, of St. Margarets, Aldgate, is to
marry Dr. Alan Lendon early in November.
Mrs. Harbison, of Bowral, N.S.W 7 ., came to
Adelaide for the marriage of her niece, Mimi
Hack, to Edward Scales at St. Peter’s Cathedral.
The wedding was also attended by Mrs. Leslie
Melville, of Sydney, a sister of the bridegroom,
whose parents reside at Medindie.
Knight William Sowden launched Jeune
Scott-Kemball’s exhibition of painted wood and
miniatures at the Argonaut Gallery. The young
artist’s work was much in demand for Christmas
gifts.
The Hospitallers’ Club of St. John of Jeru-
salem dined his Ex. at the Richmond, in recog-
nition of the Governor’s installation as a Knight
of the Order. Lady Hore-Ruthven was present.
The president of the club, Eric Millhouse, and
Mrs. Millhouse, did the honors, and the guests
included Henry Newland and his lady, Dr. C.
Wilson and Mrs. Wilson and Mayor and
Mayoress Glover.
Perth’s springtime gaieties:
Coruscating crystal stars, balloons and
streamers bobbed about against a background
of rainbow-tinted gauze in the Swan Barracks
for the Movie Ball. Mrs. Weick, sheathed in
black chiffon velvet, was there with her Lieut.-
Colonel. Mrs. S. W. Perry had a floral red
and green design on pink taffetas; Audrey
Dye’s green laces clung like vine tendrils; bil-
lowing tulle sleeves banded in satin flanked Mrs.
McCrae’s jet-black charmeuse; Tess Smallpage’s
gold sequins glittered on crimson flat crepe;
Parliament’s May Holman combined jade and
olive greens, and Nellie McGrath’s satins were
banana toned.
Artillery officers donned their red and blue
coats, decked the Naval and Military Club in
gala array and invited fair women to tread a
measure to strains from the military band. The
Colonel’s lady, Mrs. A. T. Watts, smiled in
coral-tree ninons and velvet; Major Hobbs
piloted his wife’s black satins and lei of
flowers; the Unmack brothers, Wallace and
Claude, were there with their better halves;
Margaret Giles waltzed serenely in maidenly
white chiffon; Pat Hamilton glided in moon-
light-blue moire; Lucy Stone, sported dawn-
pink silk velvet, and Roma Mansfield’s black
georgettes were profusely tucked.
Brows wrinkled thoughtfully over jigsaw
puzzles when Mrs. A. W. Jacoby, in brown and
beige crepe, feted Mesdames King and Burton,
oi Melbourne, at the Karrakatta Club. Mrs.
Claude Henriques won the prize in spite of
(he brave efforts of Romola Hansen, who
popped on a black bonnet, circled with
and a magpie creation, and came along with
Nellie Barnes and Doris Hopkins in between
shows of “Wildflower” and rehearsals for “The
Arcadians.” Mrs. Stuart-Smith, in Lido-blue
marocain, was another honored guest.
The Koolinda Ball exemplified the popularity
of shipboard dances, and, incidentally, swelled
the coffers of the R.S.L. The port’s Mayoress,
Mrs. F. E. Gibson, came in mahogany lace
sprinkled with diamente, and chairman J. W.
Lynch’s lady wore printed navy georgettes.
Vernon Lyall’s pen was responsible for the
three-act thriller staged by the Repertory Club.
Broome provided the setting, and a murdered
lugger captain and a missing pink pearl laid
the foundations for false clues. Betty Campbell
was an attractive heroine and Athol Casper did
well as a Japanese servant.
Peggy, the Hilton Woods’ blonde daughter,
returned with a fiance and a new wardrobe.
Attired in a modish milk-white flat crepe gown
she introduced Geoffrey Everett, of Surrey, Eng-
land, at a welcome home dance given by her
parents.
The Art Gallery at Newspaper House houses
a show of Lionel Jago’s Westralian landscapes
in oils and water-colors. His Ex. did the
launching.
The Speck speaking:
In the interests of the Tas. Sanatorium there
was a Zealandia Ball (named after the inter-
state steamer) in Hobart’s City Hall. The com-
mittee included many members of the ship’s
company, also knight John Evans, president
of the sanatorium committee. Flags, streamers
and ap immense Zeppelin suspended from the
ceiling figured in the decorations. The Zep.
burst asunder and released showers of balloons.
The Charles Gatehouses, Court Farm, Buck-
land, gave a dance at the Imperial for their
daughter Sheila, who was having a holiday at
home from her nursing job in Melbourne. The
guests were all young, and frocking was fresh
and fluffy.
The championship golf matches at King’s
Meadows were an excuse for many evening,
parties. Northern women entertained tljeif
southern sisters at dinner at the Brisbane, where
the table was decorated with tulips. Afterwards
there was a bridge party at Mrs. Carl Stack-
house’s home.
Longford ran its annual A.W.N.L. ball in
aid of the hospitals, and raised a good sum
thereby. V. Petitt and L. Boxhall designed the
decorations, which included a trellis with trails
of japonica. Mrs. Alan Walker made the
supper tables beautiful with large boughs of
peach-blossom and spring flowers.
The R.A.C. splashed out very gaily at its
at-home at the Masonic Hall. About 250 guests
rolled up to dance or play bridge and the
Governor and Lady Clark were there. Mr.
Weller Arnold, the president of the club,
received. Lady Clark sported midnight-blue
lace.
Mrs. T. K. Robson (Launceston) originated
the idea of a Pirates’ Ball on the Nairana in
aid of St. John’s Ambulance Assoc, and the
Junior Red Cross, and the party was an enjoy-
able one. There were ballets by Gladys Cave’s
dancers, and firework displays in addition to
other attractions.
The N.C.W. entertained Lady Clark, its new
patron, at the Lyceum Club. Opportunity was
taken also to welcome Mrs. Stourton, back
from the Swedish conference. Mrs. Lucy Ben-
son arranged the musical programme.

The Two Mosquitoes.
BY M. G. SKIPPER.
TWO mosquitoes, resting in the shadow
cast by a rafter in a bedroom at
Port Moresby, were discussing the
existence of Providence. Two ends of
the room were open to the night, which
was clear, warm, still, but alive with the
insect noises of the tropics. In the middle
of the room stood an immense bed sur-
rounded by mosquito curtains. At a
typewriter under one of the windows sat
a Government official, a tall, cadaverous,
“Forgery was invariably detected.”
bald-headed man of middle age with a
red neck. He was dressed in sandals,
white trousers and singlet.
Satu, the younger of the two mos-
quitoes (a female), maintained that the
hypothesis of a beneficent Creator was
untenable. “It is all sentimental rub-
bish,” she said. “Millions of us are born
daily, only to die miserably of hunger.
More millions of us only go to fill the
stomachs of birds, fish and other insects.
A sudden storm of rain may threaten
the existence of an entire generation.
In these circumstances, to postulate an
omniscient and omnipotent Deity is to
postulate a Being so ruthless or so in-
different to the welfare of His creatures
that He can only be regarded as an
enemy of the whole race of mosquitoes.”
Dua, the second mosquito (a male),
sighed gently. “On the other hand,” he
said, “consider the incontrovertible mani-
festations of the Divine mercy!
“Not a hundred years ago the popula-
tion of this island, ignorant, untutored
and bloodthirsty savages, were engaged in
exterminating one another. This they
were doing because of a belief that the
possession of the heads of their enemies
was the insignia of knighthood and cour-
age, although the way they went about
it was not always according to the highest
codes of chivalry. The privilege of wear-
ing a certain kind of headdress was re-
served to those who, having sprung on
their enemies from behind or shot them
from a bush, had succeeded in severing
their heads from their bodies. The
vanity of their females assisted in the
process, a maiden refusing to give her
favors to a youthful warrior unless he
presented her with a string of heads —
the fabrication of a forgery out of a
cocoanut-shell was invariably detected.
“Although the island was large enough
to accommodate a hundred times
their number, these misguided people
spent more time raiding the territories
and burning the crops of their neighbors
than in cultivating their own property.
In consequence of this, the mosquitoes
were in measurable distance of extinc-
tion through the complete disappearance
of their natural food supply. You are
doubtless aware that, by a series of events
“Began to suck vigorously .”
which can only be ascribed to the inter-
vention of Providence, this doom was
averted.”
“Never heard of it,” remarked Satu.
“They arose,” continued Dua, “owing
to the fact that the distant continent of
Europe, itself torn by internecine dis-
putes of every description, was inhabited
by a race imbued with a love of adven-
ture, a restless desire for change, a thirst
for exploration, a greed for territorial
expansion, a lust for money, certain reli-
gious convictions which they passionately
desirgd to impose on other people, a
habit of washing so infrequently that
fashionable ladies required an inordin-
ate amount of exotic perfume, and an
ignorance of the art of refrigeration
which made their meat uneatable unless
saturated in the spices of the tropics.
“Impelled by this variety of urges, they
set out on long voyages, in ill-found
ships, with forced crews, a large number
of whom usually died of scurvy. The
first of these Europeans who is known
to have visited New Guinea was the Por-
tuguese Jorge de Meneses in 1526, who
was quickly followed by a Spaniard, and
some time later by two Dutchmen.
These early visitors, however, left no
mark on the country except a few bullet
wounds in the bodies of incautious
natives.
“It remained for the English, one
of the most vigorous of these people,
to take formal possession of parts of the
island, though without effective occu-
pation. They were followed by the
Dutch and Germans, and finally the Aus-
tralians, an offshoot of the English, who
in 1883 hoisted the Union Jack and
began the colonisation of the south-
eastern portion.”
“Half a minute,” said Satu at this
juncture, “I’m feeling peckish.”
She zoomed down, and, standing in a
peculiar manner on her head and driving
her proboscis into the neck of the Gov-
ernment official, began to suck vigor-
ously. For a few seconds the white man
went on typing, but presently he raised
his hand and angrily slapped his neck,
but Satu was already back amongst the
rafters.
“Needless to say,” resumed Dua,
“what I have related is but the barest
outline of the majestic process set in

motion by Providence for the succor of
the mosquito. Explorers dauntlessly
penetrated the interior, slaughtering the
savages, and often whitening the jungle
with their own skeletons. Devoted mis-
sionaries set up their establishments, first
on the seaboard but later inland, many
being cooked and eaten without weaken-
ing the resolution of their superiors, who
made the churches of Christendom re-
sound with appeals for funds to enable
them to dispatch reinforcements.
“Traders, preferring to make their liv-
ing in a precarious fashion rather than
stay at home and make it more easily—
such was their romantic disposition-
settled on the beach, where they suffered
the most incredible hardships, were deci-
mated by disease and occasionally fol-
lowed the missionaries into the pots of
the cannibals. Prospectors, similarly
abandoning the prosaic paths of com-
merce, plunged into the forest, where
they were devoured by leeches, stung by
snakes, bitten by poisonous spiders,
speared by the natives and had their
clothes torn off them by clawed vines
and creepers. In the track blazed by the
explorers, missionaries, traders and pros-
pectors, came the administrators, men of
the highest intelligence, noblest aspira-
tions and completest disinterestedness,
fired with the triple passion of humani-
tarianism, patriotism and love of law
and order. Their achievements are not
blazoned in letters of gold in the annals
of the countries they hailed from, where
a successful haberdasher or footballer
receives far more honor ; and their lives
often ended prematurely in forgotten
graves in the jungle or were as monoton-
ous and vexatious as that of the official
you see working unpaid overtime below
you, and from whose veins you have just
obtained your dinner.”
“Without weakening the resolution of
their superiors.”
“I’m bothered if I can see,” said Satu
yawning, “how all this senseless activity
proves your argument.”
“Consider further, then,” replied Dua,
“the variety, beauty and perfection of
the white man’s organisation for the
colonisation of New Guinea. Take the
joint-stock company, for instance. This
is a comparatively modern European in-
vention.
“It grew quite unconsciously out of
the previous simple structure of in-
dustry, which consisted of cottage crafts-
men, workmen’s guilds and small fac-
tories owned by individuals who em-
ployed apprentices and treated them as
members of their family. If this system,
which was quite unsuitable for exporta-
tion, had not been replaced by some-
thing more impersonal, not to say in-
human, it would have been impossible
for European commerce to spread to
such a remote part of the world as New
Guinea.
“The joint-stock company enabled
people who knew nothing of and
cared less for the nature of the enter-
prise which paid their dividends to buy
shares in the open market. The money
they subscribed paid the fees of direc-
tors, the directors appointed boards, the
boards employed managers, and the
managers engaged staffs of engineers,
clerks and agents. By this means people
who had never heard of New Guinea
assisted in its development by fresh
young white men simply by ringing up
their brokers, and even the lower orders
took a passionate interest in tropical
colonisation. The young men were dis-
patched to New Guinea, acquired
malaria, died or had to be sent out of
the country. But no sooner did this
happen than a fresh white man started
for New Guinea. And this does not
exhaust the v/hole beauty of the pro-
cess ! ”
“Doesn’t it?” said Satu languidly.
“Every one of these joint-stock com-
panies,” proceeded Dua, “is in strenu-
ous competition with other joint-stock
companies, and the companies of each
country are collectively in competition
with the companies of other countries.
In order to preserve the welfare of their
own companies, the taxpayers of each
country willingly provide vast sums to-
wards armies and navies, and even
supply the funds for the good govern-
ment of the countries from which the
companies draw their profits. Although
passionately desiring peace and horrified
at the thought of war, they will use these

navies and armies to the last man and
the last shilling to prevent the companies
of other countries exploiting their terri-
tory. Could any more convincing proof
he provided of the existence of an
all-pervading Power, call it what you
like Categorical Imperative, Logos,
Life Force or Mosquitomorphous
Deity?”
“I may be thick-headed,” said Satu,
“but I don’t see any connection what-
ever.”
“I was afraid you wouldn’t! ” replied
Dua. “As I said before, the barbarous
inhabitants of the island, in their folly
and ignorance, were engaged in destroy-
ing one another. The admin-
istrators I mentioned have
succeeded in leading them
back into the paths of peace-
ful industry. Even the once-
inaccessible interior is being
brought under subjection,
aeroplanes, the latest and
most marvellous invention of
the white man, being em-
ployed for the purpose. To-
day a child may walk from
one end of New Guinea to
the other and keep its head
on its shoulders. New industries are
being introduced, the jungle is cleared and
planted, and the native population, once
declining, is now rapidly increasing, thus
ensuring a steady supply of food to the
real lords of creation. And each and
every one of the factors I have stated
has helped in this glorious consumma-
tion ! ”
“All the same,” said Satu obstinately,
“I don’t see how all this explains away
the fact that nine-tenths of our race lead
a precarious existence, seldom have a
full belly, and are liable at any time to
be squashed into pulp by a well-directed
slap from the hands of those very human

beings who you assert are sent for their
benefit.”
“Alas!” sighed Dua sadly, “in the
last analysis the ways of Providence will
always be inscrutable! Its ways are
mysterious, its ends beyond the grasp of
our weak mundane senses! Who can
comprehend it save through its manifes-
tations here below? Mosquito intelli-
gence is finite, Providence is infinite. Our
logic, alas! is powerless to bridge the
gap between them. One thing is, how-
ever, certain —there is something not
ourselves which makes for righteous-
ness.
“How otherwise do you explain the
arrival yesterday of that 20,000-ton
liner? If Providence had not imbued
shipping companies with commercial
enterprise 1200 full-blooded tourists
would now be spending their holidays in
Australian mountain hotels and seaside
boarding-houses.”
At this moment a native boy came in
with a whisky and soda for his master.
It could be seen that the servitor was in
the premonitory throes of an attack of
malaria. The female mosquito imme-
diately flew down, bit him in the arm
and then settled on the neck of the Gov-
ernment official.
The white man took the drink mech-
anically and went on typing.
“Malaria is known by many local
names, such as Ague, March Fever, etc.,”
he wrote. “Like Dengue Fever and
Filariasis, it is an insect-borne disease of
man. It is due to the presence of '* blood
parasite in the human body which is
transmitted by one kind of mosquito
only, namely, Anopheles. When an Ano-
phelene mosquito has itself developed
malaria, it is capable of passing it on
to the first suitable victim whom it bites.
NO ONE NEED HAVE MALARIA!
The householder, native or European,
should see that no stagnant water is
allowed to remain anywhere 0n”....
He paused to wipe his brow, and
then carefully adjusted a fresh piece of
paper.

The age-old question of theologians
which asked, “How many angels
can stand on the point of a needle ?”
has been changed to :
“How many different germs can
be found on a single tooth ?”
Bacteriologists answer this question for
us. When placed under powerful micro-
scopes and stained by various chemical
dyes which reveal the different types of
germs contained in it, a scraping of the
bacterial plaque or film coat from a nor-
mal tooth reveals the presence of scores
of different germs, not all of them harmful
to the teeth, but germs nevertheless. At
least 11 of them are very dangerous germs.
Probably the most important type of bac-
teria on your teeth is Lactobacilli, which
many of the leading dental authorities
believe are the actual organisms that cause
dental decay. These germs form acids that
dissolve the teeth, much in the same manner
that other acids eat holes into wood and
cloth.
Many organisms form a scale on teeth
called gingival calculi by the dentists, and
known as “tartar” to the public. This
scale irritates the gums, makes them bleed
when brushed, and may in time cause
serious trouble unless removed periodically
by your dentist. Other bacteria in the
mouth decompose particles of food:
noxious smelling gases are apt to be the
result, or, more plainly stated, bad breath
(halitosis).
Removal of film has therefore become
an important problem for dental science.
One of the most notable discoveries in this
field was made recently in the laboratories
of the Pepsodent Company when a new and
revolutionary cleansing material was de-
veloped. The cleansing and polishing
material is the part of any tooth paste that
does the work. Herein lies the difference
between the best tooth paste and inferior
brands. Most cleansing materials are either
so hard and abrasive that they scratch the
tooth enamel and provide crevices where
germs may lodge or else they are so soft
that they fail to remove film and stains.
This new discovery is contained in Pep-
sodent Tooth Paste exclusively, and because
it is twice as soft as the material most
commonly used, Pepsodent is looked upon
as the modern standard of safety. At the
same time this new material stands unique
in its power to cleanse and polish teeth.

Dan and Uncle.
BY STEELE RUDD.
DAN, the prodigal son, had come
home again from the West. Dan
always came home “from the West”
or “the Never-Never,” even if he had
travelled only a few miles from “down
the river” or “over the range.” And he
was generally a week and more on the
journey. But, no matter what other
changes he had been through, we found
him still the same old unreliable Dan.
This time, as on previous times, he
wasn’t going to stay very long. Couldn’t
possibly do it, having left a big contract
in the hands of his “partner” and “the
men.” That contract would take a couple
of years to finish. He had only come
home, as he had always done, to see how
“the old folk were doing,” Mother in par-
ticular, and spend Christmas with the lot
of us. Then off again, back to the Never-
Never, to see the contract through.
Dan wasn’t much concerned about
Dad ; hardly cared if he saw his sire or
not. But Dad seemed much concerned
about Dan.
It was a silent, sullen sort of concern.
When Dan retailed his thrilling exploits
to the rest of us, and romanced about
fights he had had and deals he had made
and good deeds he had done, and ex-
plained why he had brought a swag with
him instead of a leather port., and had
no clothes for the time being other than
the shabby, greasy old suit he stbod up
in, the rest of us laughed and nodded.
But Dad would glance up from the
paper he was reading or the soup
he was noisily sipping and scowl
under his heavy eyebrows at Dan —
make it unpleasant for him. And some-
times he would scowl upon Joe and Little
Bill, and tell them to “Shut up, dammit;
shut up, or leave the table at once.”
Old Uncle Peter, Dad’s brother,
who had lived with us at Ruddville so
long, and did so little, and put on such
airs that everyone who didn’t know
thought he owned the farm, took a real
liking for Dan. He went about with
Dan more as a twin brother than an old
uncle with corns under his feet and on
his head. Dad became more and more
sullen and unsociable to the prodigal. It
didn’t seem quite fair, we thought, but
then we knew that Uncle’s squeaky voice,
his depressed looks and humility and
uselessness had always acted worse than
a drought on Dad.
Uncle and Dan sauntered uselessly
round the farm, criticising and poking
their noses into everything, standing gaz-
ing at the others at work, noisily sluicing
their whiskers in a dish of water under
the peach-tree before meals, coming in
one behind the other to the table before
anyone else, occupying the best chairs,
looking hungrier than anyone else, and
eating more and talking more than any-
one else.
Dad stood it as long as he could. It
wasn’t very long.
“To hell with you out of this!” he ex-
ploded on Uncle one afternoon when
Uncle, after enjoying the shade of the
waggon during the harvesting, com-
plained of the tea that the women had
brought to the field in a bucket as being
weak and not sugared enough. “Dammit,
get your own tea and sugar it!” Then,
indicating Dan, who had calmly ap-
proached the tea-bucket with an empty
cup in his hand, “And take him with
you! ”
Uncle stared at Dad. Dan straightened
up to his full height and stared, too. The
harvest-hands all grinned neutrally.
“And get off th’ place altogether!”
Dad, fairly boiling, added. Waving his
big arms, he turned away from them.
“Well, that’s a nice way to talk!” Dan.
the empty cup still in his hand, said,
gazing at Uncle. “And to a man who’s
only a visitor! Out West we wouldn’t
treat a blackfellow that way! ”
“You don’t know him like I do, Dan,”
Uncle, after waiting till he was sure Dad
was well out of hearing, moaned.
“Don’t know him!” Dan stroked his
uncombed beard, and laughed in his
hollow voice. “He ordered me off once,
the old fool, just as he’s done you. But
this time it’s me that’ll give the walking
order ; so I’m off, too.”
“It was all uncalled fer! ” Uncle
lamented. “Not a word of any kind was
said to him ; and all th’ men lissenin’! ”
“Daniel might be the eldest-born,”
Dan went on under fresh inspiration,
“but he doesn’t intend to stay any longer
in this den.”
That evening Dan and Uncle were
absent from the supper-table. And what
a silent, solemn supper it was! And how
all of us missed them—all except Dad!
Despite the entreaties of Mother and
Sarah for them to take no notice of what
Dad had said, because he was “upset at
the harvest not turning out so well as
he expected, and didn’t think of what he
was saying,” they remained on their
bunks in the cold barn, mumbling and
chewing over the situation and planning
for the future.
“If Murty thinks I can stop here an'
let him talk to me again as if I had no
feelings, he's mistaken more than he
knows,” Uncle wheezed, “even though
he’s me brother.”
“And you’ll find,” Dan, displaying
great strength of character, said, “when
he sees the two of us both going off to-
gether in th’ mornin’, that he’ll be pretty
sorry for himself, an’ will want us to stay.
I know the Old Governor’s style! But
not me. It’ll be a long day before I
face this way to come an’ see him again.”
“You haven’t any need to paternise
him,” Uncle squeaked. “You’re indee-
pendent—you have your contrac’ to look
after, as well as he’s got his farm. And
the farm wouldn’t be what it is to-day if
it hadn’t been fer all the advice an’ help
I’ve been givin’ him.”
“You!” And Dan sat up on the bunk
and, nursing one of his legs, grinned
through the gloom of the unlighted barn
at Uncle. Dan did not lack humor.
Sparks of it often fell from him unex-
pectedly.
“Yes, me,” Uncle repeated. “But you
bein’ alwuz away at work in the Never-
Never, you wouldn’t have any idea what
a help I’ve been to him, which makes
it all the more stoopid for him to go
on like this. Th’ wimmen could tell
y’—your mother an’ sister knows what
I’ve done.”
At that moment Sarah, busy in the
kitchen, and eager to get away to a dance
at Maloney’s, was thinking of Uncle.
“Bless Dad an’ his temper!” she hissed
to Joe. “Why doesn’t he let Uncle alone?
He can wash dirty dishes, if he can’t do
anything else.”
“He never has t-t-t -time to do anythin’
else,” Joe put in, “n-n-not even to wash
his-s -self.”
* * * *
“Now, I declare, if they are not really
going!” Mother said, when after break-
fast Dan and Uncle, each with a miser-
able swag under his arm, came from the
barn to say good-bye.
Sarah giggled incredulously as the two
figures approached, the one striding re-
solutely, the other hobbling tenderly.
Curious figures they were! Dan, long
loose and gaunt, with a dark-brown beard
that he took no interest in ; Uncle, short,
shrunken, lean, wrinkled, and with a
starved, scraggy whisker that took no in-
terest in him.
“Dan might be,” Sarah said, “but
Uncle? Oh, he won’t go far, Mother —
no farther than you could chase a cow.”
She giggled more.
“That’ll do, girl,” Mother remon-
strated, “or they’ll hear you!”
But Sarah wasn’t always right; and
this time she overlooked the fact that
Uncle was much impressed with Dan and
believed in him. He hadn’t seen as much
of Dan as we had.
“But surely you are not going away
like that?” Mother said, eyeing Uncle’s
tattered clothes and scanty swag as he
held his limp hand out for her to shake.
There were tears in his little ferret eyes.
Uncle couldn’t answer. A lump that
had been gathering in his throat all night
prevented him.
“Oh, yes, he’s off, Mother. I’m taking
him with me to the West.” Dan with a
lordly wag of his head answered for both,
at the same time holding out his own
hand, which was long and bony and dirty
as a banknote. “Right out to th’ Dia-
mantina we’re going, seven hundred mile
away, where no one ever begrudges y’
the bit y’ eat, an’ don’t care whether y’
drink one cup o’ tea or forty bloomin’
cups, or whether y’ eat a slice o’ mutton
at a meal or a whole leg.”
“Well, I’m sorry, that’s all!” Mother
answered.
And the look on her face showed she
meant it.
Joe, standing silently by, looked sorry,
too ; and so did Little Bill when in turn
Dan and Uncle shook hands with them
both. But Sarah, her incredulity un-
shaken, was still inclined to titter.
“And what are you going to do —walk
all the way to the Diamantina, or what-
ever they call it?” she asked, looking
meaningly down at Uncle’s boots, which
were hard as wood, and wrinkled and
turned up at the toes.
“Walk ?” Dan repeated scornfully.
“Walk, when there’s rattlers an’ lorries
an’ tin-lizzies, an’ [striking his empty
trouser-pocket] bank-rolls.”
Dan was a wonderful optimist. Par-
liament had lost a goldmine in Dan.
“Yes, I’m goin’ in real earnest this
time, Ellen,” Uncle squeaked at last. “I’ll

be company for Dan....an’ a ’elp to
him, I hope ; an’ Murty has on’y himself
to blame ; and he’ll find it out pretty
soon, for when you an’ Sarah will have
to be alwuz in th’ kitchen you won’t be
able to be out helpin’ him.”
“And that will be a pity, won’t it?”
Sarah snapped nastily. “To be out in the
broiling sun hoeing corn or digging pota-
toes is a great treat, isn’t it?”
But Uncle did not reply. Uncle was
always too humble and docile to engage
in words with anyone, young or old.
“If you will go, Peter, you will, that’s
all,” Mother concluded, ignoring Sarah’s
little sally. “It’s your own affair. But
you must have a little money to take
with you,” and, producing a well-worn
purse from her apron pocket, she took
from it some silver.
At sight of the coins Uncle shook his
head and said: “No! No, 1 don’t want
it, Ellen ; I never did want money like
other people. Dan has enough to do the
two of us.” All the same a twinkle came
into his restless little eyes.
Dan gave a start and winked at him.
But winks or signs of any kind were
always lost on Uncle.
“Have you, Dan?” Mother questioned,
turning to the prodigal.
Of course, Dan had, “lashings” of it.
"But you better take it, though,” he
said, turning to Uncle. “Not that you’ll
have to use it when you’re with me ; but
it'll make y’ feel a bit more inder-
pendent.”
Uncle’s eyes twinkled more.
“Yes, there; take it,” and Mother
dropped the coins, ten shillings in all,
into the pocket of his tattered coat.
Turning again to Dan she said in her
quiet, pleading way: “Father is up in the
wheat paddock. You’ll go that way and
both say good-bye to him?”
Dan shifted the swag from under his
arm and laid it across his shoulder.
“Well,” he said huskily, “that’s just the
point.” He looked inquiringly at Uncle.
Uncle looped the swag round him in
real professional manner and squeaked:
“I’m finished with Murty. Don’t want
to see him ever again, though he is me
brother! ”
“Boo!” Sarah scoffed, “he’s a better
brother than ever you were! ”
With all his faults Sarah would never
listen to any insinuations against her
parent.
“That’ll do!” Mother said, silencing
her again.
“Oh, well,” Dan said airily, “there’s
nothing to be gained standin’ here any
longer, and it’s a long way to the Dia-
mantina. So make a move, Uncle, me
boy. So-long, Mother ; so-long, Sarah ;
so-long, all!”
Uncle piped out “So-longs” also, and
gave a kind of salute with his shrunken
hand. Then both made off, stepping out
irregularly side by side across the yard.
Silently, and with a touch of sadness,
we stood there grouped together, even to
the dogs and the cats and the pet lamb,
gazing after them till they opened the
rickety gate by the dairy and passed out.
Mother suddenly covered her face with
her hands and burst into tears.
“What your uncle does or is,” she
sobbed, “is nothing ; but your brother,
my son! Oh, will he ever settle down,
and try —try to do something for him-
self? God help him, why doesn’t he?”
* * * *
On across the farm paddocks Dan and
Uncle went, giving their swags a hitch
up occasionally, as if they were already
beginning to feel the weight. Coming in
sight of Dad and the farm hands, all
working their hardest in the field, Dan
said: “Perhaps we better go pretty close
to the Old Governor and give him a
chance to sing out ‘So-long.’ It won't
hurt us, and we needn’t say much to him,
anyhow.”
“Just as you like it to be, Dan,” Uncle
gasped. “I’m not one to bear ill-feel in’,
or to be ’ard in any way. ‘Fergive him
who truspess against us’ is right after all,
l do believe.”
“But let him sing out or wave to us
first,” Dan counselled. Dan wasn't going
to eat any humble pie. “And keep your
head up,” he added, “and look straight
ahead o’ y0u.... An’ if he wants us
to change our minds, well —we needn’t
be in any hurry.” Dan was ready to
weaken.
They were coming near to the har-
vesters, and would soon be right opposite
Dad and Dave, who were working side
by side.
“Don’t take any notice, now!” Dan
cautioned again. “Let him sing out first.”
But Dad was never one to take notice
of swagmen passing while he was at
work. Dad was a worker, even a bul-
locker. With Dave it was different.
“Cripes, look, Dad!” he called. “See
who’s goin’ through the paddick. Dan
an’ Uncle, with their swags.”
Waving a sheaf, he called loudly:
"Heigh! Are yous two traveilin’ or goin’
somewhfere?”
Dad took no notice.
“That’s me noble Dave,” Dan mumbled
to Uncle. “Don’t mind him. Walk a bit
quicker!” Dan was a good actor.
But Uncle had to slacken pace to get
over a fit of coughing.
Dave waved the sheaf again, and lustily
sent over a second “Heigh!” Then he
laughed and said: “They must be goin’
away for good.”
“Well, dammit, you don’t want to stop
them, do you?” Dad snorted.
Dave didn’t.
Having passed on and entered a gully
a mile beyond the boundary fence of
Ruddville, Dan and Uncle halted to rest
awhile. Looking back toward the scene
of the harvesting, Dan in grieved tones
reckoned that Dad “had got to be a hard
old dog!”
“Murty always were!” Uncle assured
him, “ever since he were a boy.”
“Ah, well,” Dan sighed, rising and em-
bracing the swag again, “there’s nothing
for it now but to keep on, I suppose.”
Climbing the hill by French’s paddock,
where the grass was long and green,
where startled hares scurried elusively
along the beds of dry watercourses, where
the only sounds they heard were the wind
in the trees and the songs of the wayside
birds, they kept on and disappeared.
The Quilt.
BY FRANKLIN KING.
THE rose-satin quilt in the corner of
the window was marked £4 19s. 6d.,
but as soon as she saw it old Mrs.
Wilson knew it was the one for which
she had longed for so many years.
She peered closely at it: £4 19s. 6d.,
or 2s. 6d. per week. Time-payment?
No. There was now enough in the bank
for the quilt—her lovely secret hoard,
mounting slowly on the long ladders of
2s. a fortnight.
A little later she hesitated on the steps
of the G.P.0., thinking about the £1 15s.
she had just received, her fortnightly pen-
sion, and the decided urgency of a new
pair of thick stockings. She could get
a pair for Is. lid, and her best ones
were so darned about the feet that her
shoes hurt her ; but the 2s. in the bank
next door was a matter of habit.
She closed her eyes and the world
seemed crimson-hued with the sheen of
the satin quilt. “Real satin,” she mur-
mured, as she passed her bankbook and
the single florin across the counter;
“and real down. I’ll come in the morn-
ing and buy it.”
Two bananas for Bobbie and Fay, the
usual half-pound of boiled sweets, saus-
ages for dinner, and a reel of white
crochet-cotton from the “self-serve."
Then the old lady was ready for the
tram, the remainder of her pension
money firmly guarded in her shabbv
black bag.
She must remember to hide her bank-
book when she reached Ellie’s. The
quilt would be a tremendous surprise.
Ellie had sausages spluttering in the
pan when Gran came out of her room.
Always on pension day Gran brought
home the sausages and had dinner with
the family. At other times she sat at
the little table before the window in her
room and drank unsweetened black tea
from an old cracked cup. To-day she
had tea with sugar and milk, and as she
leaned forward to warm her hands she
wished Ellie would soon make the tea.
She took fifteen shillings from her
purse and laid it on the table.
“Here you are, Ellie. I’m sorry it’s
not more.”
“So am I,” Ellie said, stretching her
hand quickly for it. “Ifs lucky you are
to be able to get a room for seven and
six a week. Old Mrs. Grey has to pay
eight and six—poky little room, too.”
Gran’s eyes flashed with a little of
their old fire.
“Maybe she has no furniture of her
own,” she said.
“That’s right, mum. Throw it up that
it’s your furniture in your room —and
p’r’aps meaning Fay’s cot, too. If you
begrudge the. child that thing”
“Not at all, dear. Please don’t be
angry with your mother. I’m sorry I was
so foolish. Come to Gran, Fay darling,
and see what’s in this bag. You, too,
Bobbie.”
Early in the afternoon Ellie went out,
leaving Gran in charge of the children
She didn’t mind that —it meant she could
keep the fire going in Ellie’s room.
Edgar arrived. He was her eldest son,
now a man with a grown family of his
own. But times had been bad with him.
and but a few days before Ellie had told
her he had tried to borrow from Bob.

“Well, mum.” He drew a chair nearer
to the fire, warming his great red hands.
“And how are you, my boy?”
“Don’t ask me! I’m up against it.”
She stooped over the fire, her old hands
shaking. They all seemed to think she
was wealthy.
“What I really came for, mum,” said
Edgar suddenly, “is to see if you’ve got
a few pounds you could lend me.”
Gran’s crochet fell from her hands.
“Me? Oh, Edgar, why do you think I
could?”
“Well, you get 17s. 6d. a week clear,
and you’re lucky to have that all to your-
self. 1 must have a fiver by to-morrow.
If I can’t get it I’ll lose my cows ; and
once they’re gone it’s the end of me and
the kids and Jess.”
His mother folded the edge of her
crochet between her fingers. Pleat, pleat,
pleat; baby, baby, baby—that, it seemed,
had been the rhythm of her life. Her
fingers released their hold ; the pleats
were separated ; the family was divided.
So thinking, she did not hear Edgar’s
next remark. He addressed her sharply.
“Eh, what’s that?” she asked.
“1 know you would if you could, mum,
although some say you wouldn’t.”
“Oh, and who said that?” Tears
quivered in Gran’s voice. She had tried
to do her best by her family.
Edgar regretted his words. “Never
mind, mum. 1 s’pose we can get on the
dole. Once the cows is gone”
“How much did you say?” The room
seemed to be full of rose-satin quilts.
“Five pounds, mum. I gotta meet a
chap to-morrow morning.”
Next pension day she bought the stock-
ings for Is. lid., the bananas, the saus-
ages, the sweets and the crochet-cotton ;
but she did not go near the bank.
That afternoon Ellie again went out.
Some time later a bulky brown-paper
parcel arrived and was deposited on the
kitchen-table.
Ellie herself came in soon after.
“Oh, my parcel has come!” she cried.
“I must show you, mum. It’s lovely ;
but wait until I get my things off.”
While she was in her bedroom, Bob,
her husband, came home.
“Parcel, hey,” he said. “Whose?”
“It’s Ellie’s,” Gran explained. “She’ll
be out in a minute.
Bob cut the string as Ellie entered.
Gran caught a glimpse of tissue-papers
beneath the thick brown wrapping, and
then a bewildering flash of rose and
floral satin.
“Oh, my quilt!” cried Ellie from the
doorway. “Isn’t it a beauty?”
“The quilt,” Gran whispered. There
were the same roses in the floral parts,
the same gorgeous blue ribbon bow
against the dull rose satin. It was her
quilt, not Ellie’s. Something like hysteria
was beating in her throat.
“Where the dickens did you get the
money for that thing?” cried Bob
sharply, glaring suspiciously at Ellie.
“Why, where do you think? I’ve saved
it out of Gran’s money. Mrs. Windsor
is coming on Friday afternoon and i
had to get one. She has a beauty.”
Her voice was pert enough, but Gran
knew she was lying about the money.
“Anyhow,” Ellie went on, “it wasn’t
dear—only thirty-five shillings. You
wouldn’t understand, of course ; but it’s
only cheap stuff.”
Gran put her palm upon the silky cover.
It was her quilt, “marked down to
£4 19s. 6d.,” and Ellie was pretending
it was mean and cheap.
“Not on time-payment, I hope,”
growled Bob. “You know I won’t have
anything like that.”
“Why, darling, how ridiculous! Of
course I wouldn’t. Gran knows I
wouldn’t have a thing t.-p.”
That night Gran tiptoed into Ellie’s
room before Bob and his wife went to
bed. She stroked the lovely satiny sur-
face until tears rolled down her face and
she was afraid they might soil the quilt.
The next pension-day she commenced
her quilt account all over again, paying
in two shillings. She bought sausages,
bananas, crochet-cotton and half a pound
of boiled sweets.
Edgar had promised to repay some of
the loan within the month. When the
fifth week went by she gave up hope.
Olive had never repaid the £4 she had
lent her three years ago when the baby
was ill; so she could scarcely expect
Edgar to do so.
Then Gran went down with influenza.
It hit her hard, and for weeks every spare
penny she had was spent on medicine
and little extras in food. For nearly
three months the 2s. entry remained
lonely in the bankbook.
Ellie had said carelessly one day:
“Your blankets don’t seem too thick,
mum. Aren’t you cold?”
“Sometimes. But I always put my
old brown coat across my feet.”
“You want a quilt like mine! I’ll
never forget the look on Mrs. Windsor’s
face when she saw it.” She punched vigor-
ously at the pillow, setting it to rights.
“It’s a wonder you never had a quilt,
mum —you with your pension these last
six years. I couldn’t do without mine.
Why don’t you get one on time-pay-
ment?”
“No, Ellie ; I’m like Bob —won’t have
anything 1 can’t pay for.”
“Aw, Bob’s too old-fashioned.”
“But, Ellie, you didn’t get that quilt
like that, did you? So much a week?”
“Not on your life! I couldn’t keep
a secret like that from Bob ; and he’d
be terrible if he found out I’d told him
a lie.”
When the old lady was able to collect
her pension personally, she felt she must
get Ellie a present. So she bought her
a box of face-powder instead of banking
the two shillings.
Tragedy came to the house. There
was a frantic call at midnight for an
ambulance.
Before night fell next day Ellie was
dead.
After the funeral Bob told Gran of
his plans.
“My sister is coming here for a bit,”
he said, “to look after the children and
see to everything. I’ll get you to show
her what’s to be done.”
He went into the bedroom and threw
open the wardrobe door.
“Take anything you like of Elbe’s,”
he said, “and pack the rest away. 1
can’t bear to see anything that belonged
to her.”
He turned towards the bed and laid
his head against the cool wood.
“There’s no need for you even to find
a home anywhere else, Gran,” he said
kindly, his rugged face haggard with
grief. “I’d feel happier about the child-
ren if you were round ; and I want you
to live with us. Have all your meals
with us, and potter about the house and
garden as if they were your own. It
was against my wish”
He broke off abruptly. His sobs
mingled with the old lady’s weeping.
He reached over and dragged the rose
satin quilt from the bed.
“Here, mum, you have this,” he said.
“I never liked it much, and I saw how
you loved it the day it came.”
Thrusting the quilt into her arms he
walked heavily from the room.
The quilt was hers! All her married
life she had wished for a gay eiderdown
quilt—had spasmodically saved for it,
and often had given up hope. Then when
Will had died and left her with five small
children it was no use thinking any more
of satin quilts.
That night she found sleep most diffi-
cult. The warmth of the quilt was won-
derful, its texture exquisite. It glowed
in her sombre little room like a flame-
red peony in a smoky den. It filled
her body with joy and her soul with
undreamed-of bliss.
Three days later a man came to the
door and asked for Ellie.
“You speak to him, Gran,” said Bob’s
sister.
The young man stared at her.
“Mrs. Dawson,” he said. “Isn’t she at
home?”
“She’s dead,” Gran replied. "Any-
thing I can do?”
“I’m the collector from Smith, Jones
and Brown, furnishing stores. There’s a
quilt here that she got” He con-
sulted his notebook.
“Yes?” Gran clutched the edge of the
door.
“There’s half a crown a week to be
paid on it. She missed three weeks, so
that’s ten shillings due. Shall I call
every week, or would you rather pay at
the office?”
Earth’s Roadways.
Lo, all ways run from morning:
The Red Road and the White;
And all roads run to sunset,
And, after that, the night.
They wind about the face of earth,
They compass all her streams,
The tranquil White, the royal Red,
The long Blue Road, for commerce spread,
The Brown Road that the pixies tread,
And the Grey Road of Dreams.
And some are old, so old they heard
The clang of Roman swords,
When legions marched at dawning light,
Through shadowed weald and wooded height,
With golden eagles poised for flight,
Earth’s conquerors and lords.
They know the height of sacrifice,
The depth of human pain,
The secrets of the world they hold,
Before their knowledge, calmly cold,
All human mysteries unfold
And hidden things grow plain.
Love, sorrow, hate, they know them all,
And myriad crimes untold:
And patiently they bear with each,
For earth has nothing new to teach,
Nor any wonder past the reach
Of wisdom centuries old.
And still by countless, careless feet
Their silent ways are trod;
In that far-off eternity,
When all have speech, the bond and free,
I sometimes think the Roads will be
The Witnesses of God.

You are sure to be interested in at least one of
the people who, in “The Efficient Mind,” speak highly
of Pelmanism from practical experience. It may be a
prominent personality who has captured your imagin-
ation, or it may be a neighbor who has earned your
respect. Get a copy of “The Efficient Mind" now—
write at once.
Pelmanism may be mastered by giving to it 20
or 30 minutes a day for about three months. There
are 1 2 lessons in the Course. It is intensely interest-
ing, and the results begin to show within a week.
It is taught by post.
The Pelman Institute is a world-wide organisation of
30 years’ standing. Its Headquarters are in London.
" Pelmanism is a living and growing scheme
of self-mastery and self-development.”
PELMANISM
Scientific Training of Mind,
Memory and Personality
UNNECESSARY BURDENS
IF your concentration is defective so that you do not master problems that should be
within the range of your mental ability; if your will-power is weak so that you are stopped
by obstacles that normal energy and courage would get through, under or over with a
laugh; if you are lacking in self-confidence so that you stand by timidly whilst others take
what might easily be yours; if your memory fails so often at critical moments that you have
become fearful of yourself—if you have these disabilities, or one of them, you are carrying
an entirely unnecessary burden.
Pelmanism, by training on positive lines, will take this burden from you. It will change “I
don't care” or “I can’t” to “I want” and “I will. It will do this by quickening your percep-
tions so that the means by which you gather information, store it and make use of it will be
fully competent; it will start the beneficient interaction between ability and confidence, that
marvellous extension of power, the steps of which are effort followed by confidence, and
greater effort by greater confidence, until achievement becomes the rule, judgment and
decision habitual processes and self-confidence an integral part of the personality.
Concentration, will-power, self-confidence, a reliable memory, these are the qualities that
Pelmanism develops. It might almost be said that Pelmanism creates them, for so marked
is the change in the Pelmanist that for practical purposes he acquires, in many important
respects, a new, a stronger and a more engaging personality.
But the process is one of development, not of creation, for happily in every normal indi-
vidual the attributes and powers are there, and proper training will bring them out.
THE METHOD.
Besides the twelve textbooks of Pelmanism, con-
taining information and graded mental exercises
of great practical value, each lesson is accom-
panied by a Progress Work Sheet to be submitted
to the Institute. These Work Sheets are carefully
revised by qualified Examiners and returned with
letters of advice. They constitute a chain of
personal references in which the full scope of the
Pelman System is brought to bear on the develop-
ment of the student and on his personal difficulties.
1 his thorough revisional work is an outstanding
feature of the Pelman training.
ITS EFFECT.
The obvious effect of the Pelman Training, observ-
able very early in the Course, is a quick and
accurate memory for faces, names, facts, figures,
business conversations, for *what has been said
and what has been read, for what has been done
and what is to do, for cards, languages and the
general material of study. There is a quickening
of the natural perceptive faculties reflected in
increased ability to concentrate, greater powers of
decision and much greater confidence, so that
we find Pelmanists in all walks of life accepting
cheerfully, inside and outside their occupations,
responsibilities that they were once afraid of. They
seek and get better positions, they are able to
speak without notes, they meet others on terms of
equality, they accept office in Lodge, in Council,
in Parliament, and acquit themselves creditably.
In short, they carry within themselves a wider
range of consciousness, greater aptitudes, and
justified self-confidence, qualities which give per-
sonality and mark their possessors for advance-
ment and progress.
