CARLISLE CASTLE REMEMBERS THE DAYS OF STERN BORDER STRIFE
the county town of Cumberland in England, has an
_ ancient and stormy history. For centuries it was a border
citadel and the scene of most bitter fighting between the English
and the Scots.
The castle, bounded by the ancient city walls, on the bank of
the Eden, was built originally in 1092 by William Rufus and stands
on a site the history of which reaches much farther back into the
mists of the past. That in Roman times it was a place of some
importance is proved by the number and variety of relics discovered
during excavations. When the Romans had been withdrawn from
Britain in the fifth century to protect their crumbling empire at
home, Carlisle became the scene of strife, and among those who
fought for it were Piets, Caledonians, Celts and Angles. Poetry in
its old ballad form connects the town with King Arthur and his
knights, a connection which gives rise to the title of “Merrie
Carlisle.”
In 875 the Danes destroyed the town, and for two centuries it
did not regain its power until the reign of William Rufus, when he
drove away the invaders and built the castle. In later Norman and
Edwardian times important additions were made, and Henry VIII
adapted the interior for cannon. Its walls and dungeons have held
many famous prisoners, among them Mary Queen of Scots at the
commencement of her long and weary imprisonment in 1568. From
the battlements she could obtain a distant view of her own land
and dream of the days when she might re-cross the border to assume
the crown of Scotland —dreams never to be realised, for her cap-
tivity ended in death at the hands of the headsman on a dull
February morning in 1587.
Carlisle Castle is also associated with Bonnie Prince Charlie,
and one of the most heroic of ancient times is still recalled ; under
cover of night “bold Buccleuch” rescued Kinmont Willie from this
stronghold in 1596. Carvings which may still be seen on the walls
of the castle dungeons are attributed to Scottish prisoners of about
the year 1745.
The ravages of time and the hand of man have altered and
reduced the ancient fortress, and at the present time lictle of its
ancient grandeur is left, although the Norman Keep is still one of
the finest examples of its kind in England.

RUPERT BUNNT.
Rupert Bunny’s paintings have not
lacked publicity in the Sydney dailies in
recent years, yet Clive Turnbull records
in The Art of Rupert Bunny (Ure Smith
Pty., Ltd.) that when the artist died in
Melbourne, six months after the big
retrospective exhibition of his works at
the Victorian National Gallery, a Syd-
ney newspaper announced, “David Run-
ning, R.A., well-known Australian artist,
died on Saturday.” Reporters and sub-
editors on the Sydney popular press are
capable, through ignorance, of mis-
spelling the name of the Almighty ; but
it is obvious that Bunny is not as well
known as he should be.
Even in artistic circles, when the great
figures of Australian art are discussed
—Gruner, Streeton, Lambert, Norman
Lindsay, Hans Heysen and the rest—his
name is not often mentioned. And this,
on the surface, is strange: for the prin-
cipal galleries have exhibited his can-
vases for years and, as is shown by a
catalogue in the Ure Smith book, he was
well supported by private buyers in Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Turnbull, who writes, as always,
as if he is St. George .fighting a dragon,
is inclined to blame the Common-
wealth Government for the lack of
popular regard for Bunny, on the
ground that he was never commissioned
by Canberra to paint prodigious murals.
But we are not living in a Soviet or
Fascist community where artists are con-
trolled and supported by the State. The
privilege of supporting the arts in Aus-
tralia, outside the National Galleries, lies
on private citizens who can afford to do
it; and Bunny, as indeed he told Mr.
Turnbull—“l can sell all I want to in
Sydney”—had little to complain of.
Generally, a man paints what is ip him
to paint; the murals Bunny dreamed of
may have been only a dream ; and per-
haps it is as well they remained so. To
paint largely is excellent; but there
comes a point, when a painting cannot
be taken in by the eye at a glance, where
size is a disadvantage ; where a work of
art becomes a freak, a curiosity, a mon-
strosity, a mere decoration.
It was not Government neglect that
made Rupert Bunny a man of the
shadows but the fact that he lived most
of his life in Paris, returning to Mel-
bourne only at intervals to arrange for
exhibitions and, finally, to die. It is that
same fact, one suspects, that has inspired
the clamorous publicity his works have
recently been given in the Sydney popu-
lar press, for it is the fashion of the
moment to prefer a painting of French
landscape to a painting of Australian —
unless the Australian happens to be
painted so much under French influence
that it looks like European earth and
light and not like Australian.
Art is, as Clive Turnbull says, uni-
versal; “It is foolish to set off one kind
of subject-matter against another. The
manifestations of the universal take many
forms. The vision of Hogarth and the
vision of Blake have nothing in com-
mon ; only a fool would say that these
were not both great men.” But perhaps
there has been something more than mere
nationalism, mere parochialism, in the
general failure to recognise Bunny’s
qualities. Perhaps there is something
lacking in those qualities themselves.
When an Australian goes off to Europe
to paint he may lose more than his native
gum-trees ; he may lose his individuality.
Bunny worked, Mr. Turnbull rightly says,
directly in the great tradition; yes, and
perhaps he lost himself in it.
We may imagine a parallel case by
supposing that Walt Whitman had gone
to England to write his poetry. With his
vigor of mind he would certainly have
continued to write; but his wild, ex-
uberant Muse would surely have been
changed, modified, tamed. This, in some
respects, to his advantage perhaps; yet
a major talent might well have been
clipped and compressed into a minor.
And certainly, though he might have
taken a place like T. S. Eliot in the Eng-
lish tradition, an Anglicised Whitman
would never have meant so much to
America as he does today.
Rupert Bunny did well in Paris. To
quote from Tristan Byesst’s “biographi-
cal sketch” in the Ure Smith book: —-
The French Government purchased
A pres le bain in 1904 and Un rayon de
soldi in 1906 for the Luxembourg collection,
the highest honor that French art could
bestow upon a living painter. The first
Australian to be so honored, he also
enjoyed the distinction, then shared by only
two other British artists, of representation
in the Luxembourg by more than one of
his works. The Government added a third
work from his brush in 1917, while nine
others were purchased from time to time
for other public galleries in France. Many
fine canvases of the earlier period went to
public or private collections in Hungary and
Russia, South America and the United
States.
He did well; but did he do distinctively?
Did he break new ground as, especially
before they made their trips abroad, did
Gruner and Streeton in Australia, artisti-
cally as well as geographically? Did he
preserve, in the artistic centre of the Old
World, that fiery delight and freedom' of
the New World which reveals itself in
the color and drama of Norman Lind-
say’s oils and watercolors? Did he pre-
serve an original viewpoint? And, if he
did, how strong was its individuality?
While these questions remain un-
answered one must regard Mr. Turnbull’s
assurance that Bunny is “our finest artist”
with reserve. And they are questions
which, however Mr. Turnbull has arrived
at his decision, are practically impossible
to answer at the present time. While
Bunny’s work is scattered from Russia
to the Argentine, and while, as the pub-
lishers of The Art of Rupert Bunny
record, the artist kept no list of dates or
sizes of his paintings, who, until some
devoted globe-trotter inspects it all for
us, is to tell us precisely what he painted
and how valuable or otherwise it all may
be? By what process of arithmetic or
guesswork does Mr. Turnbull decide even
the point that Bunny’s “oeuvre” —mean-
ing; presumably, the total of his paintings
and their total effect—is “approached
only by Streeton’s”: therefore not to be
approached by Gruner, by Heysen, by
Norman Lindsay, by Lambert?
The Art of Rupert Bunny helps, to
some extent, to determine Bunny’s stand-
ing in Australian art. There are the notes
on his career, the proofs of his reputa-
tion overseas, supplied by Mr. Turnbull
and" Mr. Buesst. There is Mr. Turnbull’s
statement, imprecise but impressive, that
Bunny painted “a stupendous number of
pictures.” There is the list of paintings
owned privately or by galleries, in Aus-
tralia: in itself a considerable body of
work. And, most importantly, there are
the reproductions: ten plates in color
and 32 in black-and-white.
There are faults and weaknesses in
these, sometimes Bunny’s, sometimes the
inevitable limitations of. reproduction.
Except for “August Morning” and the
luminous “Th,e Canche at Etaples” the
black-and-white landscapes are vague
and blurred. “Landscape Le Lavandou,”
reproduced in color, suggests that the
weakness lies in Bunny’s technique as well
as in the disadvantages of black-and-
white, for this painting, though attractive
in its warm- pink and blue,’ looks ele-
mentary beside the delicacy of a Gruner,
meretricious beside the boldness of a
Streeton. One notices, particularly, a
blossoming tree in the foreground: in a
Gruner oil the blossoms would have
been like snowflakes irradiated with
color, like flakes of light itself; in the
Rupert Bunny they are like pink fuzz.
But the French landscapes, which he
turned out by the score in his last years
in Melbourne from notes, from
memory and, as Clive Turnbull records,
from fancy—are not where Bunny’s
strength lies. The Ure Smith plates have
great beauty as well as some weaknesses.
There is a magnificent portrait of the
artist’s wife in color, and, in black-and-
white, there are a self-portrait, a picture
of a girl at a table (“A Cup of Choco-
late”) and a portrait of Melba, all of
which seem equally fine.
There are some reproductions of
Bunny’s decorative style, rhythmical,
highly-colored works, looking like decor
for ballet —one of them is owned by
Borovansky. They make lively color-
plates, but beside Bunny’s most impres-
sive paintings—“ The Shrimp Fishers” and
“Slave Women” among the color-plates
in this volume —the merely decorative
works look facile.
It is on such paintings as “The Shrimp
Fishers” and “Slave Women,” and on
others in the same category among the
monochrome reproductions, that Bunny’s
reputation will finally rest. These are
not only beautiful pictures—and they
are very beautiful —but they are substan-
tial. Black-and-white reproduction, as in
the case of “A Summer’s Morning,” blot-
ting out the tranquil light and the gentle
and harmonious colors, cannot possibly
do justice to these pictures; but at least
the firm, masterly technique still shows,
and the smoothness of composition, the
feeling for character, the grace and love-
liness of the women.
To have made color-plates of more of
Bunny’s paintings in this category would
doubtless have been too expensive. The
plates are admirably varied, and 10 is a
reasonable ration for any art book. But
it is regrettable that the sizes of these
paintings have not been stated; for, if
Bunny is to be properly appreciated, it is
vital that the public should be told, or
reminded, that “A Summer’s Morning”
is not merely a big picture, but enor-
mous. In an average modem flat it would
cover an entire wall. It is about twice
the size of “Fire’s On” ; twice the size of
“Spring Frosts” ; it is bigger than Nor-
man Lindsay’s “Don Juan.” The com-
panion Bunny in the N. S. Wales
National Gallery, “Morning,” is almost
equally large.
It is true that artistic excellence is not
to be measured only in square feet. But
it is also true —and too often forgotten
—that massive reputations are not made
by paintings the size of a pocket-handker-
chief. What A. G. Stephens wrote about
bulk in poetry applies with equal force
to painting:
Bulk counts in one’s impression of great-
ness even if some of the bulk is unworthy.
It is true that poetic rank can be fixed by a
stanza, perhaps even by a line; but place
in the rank is fixed by total weight of per-
formance.
How many of these colossal oils did
Bunny paint, and at what period of his
career? We are not informed in
this book; but we do know that
he painted “a stupendous number
of pictures,” that his small or medium-
sized paintings of girls in the sun-
light have charm, that there is drama
in his Biblical pictures and that his giant
canvases have both charm and a tran-
quil, reposeful majesty.
Beyond the statement of charm in his
women. Bunny may not have had any-
thing strongly original to say, or if he
did have individuality he may have lost
it in Europe ; his talent, after the big
pictures were painted, may have
dwindled ; he may not directly contribute
anything to the development of a distinc-
tively Australian art; yet it seems cer-
tain that, because he was born in this
country and some of his masterpieces are
here, he will exert an increasingly, import-
ant influence on Australian painting.
At the moment he may serve merely
to inspire imitation French landscapes.
But he stands, ultimately, for bulk of
output, for the painting of the figure, for
mastery of technique, for composition on
the grand scale, for beauty and majesty
of the finished work ; for, as Clive Turn-
bull says, “the great tradition.” Re-
garded as an introduction to his work, if
not a definitive summing-up, The Art of
Rupert Bunny serves an excellent pur-
pose; it is an interesting and valuable
book, and (printed by Waite and Bull) a
very handsome piece of craftsmanship.
Gandhi Through a Mist
George Catlm’s In the Path of
Mahatma Gandhi (Macdonald) adds
little to what newsreels and press articles
have made familiar of one of the most
significant figures of the century. In a
book of 66 chapters, 59 are exhaustive
(and somewhat exhausting) dissertations
on the philosophy and religion of Hindu-
ism ; and, though the author has met
Gandhi five times, only once are we
actually in his presence.
While conceding that Gandhi’s politics,
his policies of non-violence and passive
disobedience stem directly from his
philosophy, is it necessary to probe
deeply into its most complex tenets to
characterise the man? And in writing
like this?
To this Real all evil is privation, and
that which seems to be so wholly “real”
that men call regard for it “realism,” but
yet which is not wholly real but only the
.back-current, the “becoming-less,” the
strain, the break-up, the decay, the “seem-
ing” or Maya (which is yet actual enough
to us who also are transient), subservient
to God who is and creates and energises
what is Becoming.
Compare this with the luminosity of
Gandhi’s own expression of his faith in
Harijan, his journal:
Since God pervades everything nothing
belongs to you, not even your own body.
God is the undisputed, unchallengeable
Master of everything you possess.
Catlin is a socialist and a journalist, at
one time special European correspondent
for the Yorkshire “Post.” Calling him-
self “Faust,” he sets out on a pilgrim-
age to “visit the seer of India, who for
over 70 years has been dedicated to the
teaching of peace, and see what the East
has to offer after all this [European]
corruption of politics and power.”
Promising enough, but the draughts-
man, of the Declaration for the Inter-
national Recognition of Indian Inde-
pendence, which authorship he takes
pains to claim half a dozen times, in-
stead of finding his way to Gandhi un-
fortunately loses it in his maze of
philosophy.
To readers who know little of Hindu-
ism, yet who would like to know much
about its distinguished disciple—and the
great majority of Catlin’s readers, since
he writes in English, must fall into this
category —the pilgrimage will be disap-
pointing. Though his book throngs with
outstanding characters —Nehru, Patel, the
poet Tagore, Abul Azad and scores more,
all of whom he knows intimately none
is vigorously drawn. Yet most of a chap-
ter explains why the cow is worshipped
in India, when its use is as obvious as
the reindeer in Lapland and the seal to
Eskimos,
In Part Two the socialist becomes the
journalist, with an immediate improve-
ment in style and general interest. Gat-
lin tells Gandhi’s life story, and though
it is culled mainly from the Mahatma’s
autobiography Gatlin traces it with
studious objectivity.
After this too-brief illumination—a
fraction of the book’s three parts—the
author plunges again into the half-light
of obscure philosophies, unintelligible
Indian phrases and sketchy portraits of
India’s great men. The only man drawn
clearly is the best-known of all—Mount-
batten.
The R.A.N.
The Royal Australian Navy, by Frances
McGuire (Oxford), is surprising in two
things: first, that a laywoman could
amass such a wealth of accurate infor-
mation about the Navy, and second, that
with it all the author has produced a
work with reader-interest only slightly
above that of Jane’s Fighting Ships.
The book traces the R.A.N.’s history
from its inception, on the way including
a chapter on Sea Power. But as almost
every Admiral in the British Navy has
at some time published his views thereon,
nothing new is added to a subject whose
importance is now appreciated even by
politicians.
With a war in which the R.A.N. played
a distinguished part just over, one may
be excused for digesting somewhat impa-
tiently the early history of the Service in
order to reach the still fresh story of
its actions. The author has apparently
had access to Naval historical files at
Intelligence, Melbourne. Comprised of
captain’s action reports, battle summaries
and eyewitness accounts, these offer an
investigator the most minute details of a
battle, from the number of shells fired to
the number, and whereabouts, of those
received.
Yet even with this mass of information,
the stories of our ships’ actions, studded
with the names of ships and commanding
officers, and with scores of figures, fail to
emphasise the truth that actions are not
so much encounters of ships and machines,
as battles of men.
An exception is the Battle of Matapan.
Here the author has dug beneath the
deadening recital of names and has
brought up something of the flash and
thunder of that night. But the story of
cruiser Perth’s fight against the pack
around her is covered in three pages, and
Canberra’s sinking, of sympathetic im-
portance to Australians, is dismissed in
14 lines.
If the same assiduity in scanning
records had been applied to presenting
something of the play and clash of
character, some depicting of the tenseness
and drama, bravery and fear of the
human element in our great naval actions,
the book could have been the best of
its kind. As it is, its chief value is as a
work of reference.
The defect in the study of The Aus-
tralian Coal Industry (Melbourne Univer-
sity Press), by two Melbourne University
lecturers, A. G. Shaw (Modern History)
and G. R. Binns (Economics), is that,
even though they have tried to expand
their pre-war researches to cover the
story of the war years, the book is, for
today’s purposes, out of date. The latest
Davidson Commission Report (1946) is
hardly discussed at all —let alone com-
pared with the recommendations of the
Davidson Report of 1930. The need for
replanning the surroundings and for de-
veloping other industries (introducing
new interest in the local working life) in
the coalfields towns is now well-accepted.
The authors have no great hopes ot
“dual control” (mineowners and the
Government Control Board) and think
the British proposals for “self-govern-
ment” in the industry-devising a share in
its direction by the miners—is the best
hope of coping with the settled discontent
in its operatives. This follows the lines
of the Sankey Report in U.K. of 1919
and embraces the establishment of local,
district and national councils, comprising
representatives of producers, consumers
and experts, under general government
supervision. But whether the industry
would thus be made contented, and what
sort of control —since control there must
be —would be devised under “self-govern-
ment,” are questions to which answers
cannot be provided.

IMPORTANT DATES . .
for Holders of \
Commonwealth Bonds
and Inscribed Stock
If you have ever bought Commonwealth
Bonds (War Loan Bonds, for instance)
or Inscribed Stock, make sure you avoid
any interruption to the interest payments
you receive from your investment. Com-
pare the maturity dates of your securities
with those shown above.
If you have lodged with your bank for
safe custody more than £lO worth of any
of the securities noted above you should
have received a letter from the Prime
Minister, accompanied by a folder
explaining how your securities may be
converted.
Cash Subscriptions Also Invited
Investment in the* Sixth Security Loan
is not confined to those with maturing
securities to convert. Everyone may
buy Bonds for cash or by instalments
(for £lO, £5O, £lOO, £5OO or £1,000),
or Inscribed Stock, through any Bank,
Savings Bank, Money Order Post
Office or Stockbroker. Interest is pay-
able each six months at 3i% per
annum for fourteen years. Repayment
in full at maturity is guaranteed by
the Commonwealth, Save for Security
—invest now in advance in the Sixth
Security Loan.
If you have not received such a letter,
check the maturity dates of your securi-
ties in one of the following ways:
1. If your Bonds ore in your own possession.
Look at them at once and compare the
maturity date printed at the top with
those shown above.
2. If you lodged your Bonds with your bonk for
safe keeping. Most banks issue a receipt
or acknowledgment for Bonds left with
them for safe custody. If you hold any
such receipts, compare the maturity dates
shown with those above.
3. if you cannot discover maturity dates.
Go to your bank to-day and ask whether
they hold for you any of the securities
noted above.
HOW TO CONVERT
If you find that your securities are about
to mature, ask your bank or stockbroker
for an application form for conversion
into the Sixth Security Loan. Fill in one
form for each scries of Bonds or Stock
maturing and hand it back. That’s all.
You will then possess Sixth Security Loan
Bonds or Inscribed Stock of the same
value as your maturing securities, and
interest on your securities will continue.

By whom were logarithms in-
vented ?
Logarithms were invented indepen-
dently by John Napier, a Scotsman,
and Joost Biirgi, a Swiss. The log-
arithms which they invented differed
from each other and from the com-
mon and natural logarithms now in
use. Napier’s logarithms were pub-
lished in Edinburgh in 1614 under the
titje Mirifici logarithmorum canonis
descripdo. When in 1620 Biirgi’s
logarithms appeared at Prague under
the title Arithmetische und Geomet-
rische Progresstabulen, Napier’s log-
arithms were already known and
admired quite generally throughout
Europe.

At Sorell (Tas.) there is q memorial
to two soldiers who served in the
South African War. Details of the
unit with which they served and
circumstances of their death?
The 3rd Aust. Commonwealth
Horse, consisting of three companies
from N. S. Wales and one each from
Queensland and Tasmania, left Syd-
ney on April 1, 1902, on the Man-
hattan and arrived at Durban on
April 30. The regiment remained in
camp at Kitchener’s Kop, near New-
castle, until after peace was pro-
claimed on May 31, 1902. They saw
no actual service, but those who had
not previously been to* South Africa
received a medal with onfe clasp.
The regiment returned to Sydney on
Aug. 11, 1902, on the Drayton
Grange. There were six deaths from
sickness on the return voyage, in-
cluding the two Tasmanians, Troopers
Charles Cundy and Vincent Lake
Hodgman.

Origin of the Darbalara milking
Shorthorn cattle; and were any im-
ported bulls used; if so, how many?
The stud was founded in 1899 by
T. J. Cole, of Bolaro, later Dar-
balara, Gundagai (N.S.W.), when he
bought a number of good unmated
dairy heifers of mixed Shorthorn
blood in the Illawarra district. It
is understood that he purchased only
one sire, and during the 36 years that
the stud was maintained, tested the
cattle, selected herd sires from out-
standing producers within his own
herd ** f u P the
made the stud famous. The stud was
dispersed when the estate was cut up
and sold in 1925 .

Top class polo ponies are usually
thoroughbred strain, pure or three-
quarter bred, selected for compact-
ness, good conformation, speed and
stamina. A “good head” is essen-
tial. Height about 15 to 15.2 hands.
Training does not start until about
4 years old, or older. Most polo
ponies reach their prime at 7 or 8
years of age, and may then remain
good performers until 13, or even
older. A pony becomes accustomed
to the one rider and, for him, will
reveal outstanding intelligence.
Not until a whisky is five years old
or more does it reach its best age.
It is then a mature and mellow
beverage. Corio Whisky is matured
for over five years (more than
double the minimum prescribed by
Commonwealth law).

APPLE PIE AND CREAM
BY Bruan James
ii O on y° ur l at^es an( *
jr\ gentlemen, you see the Churchill
/ \ Rock. From this point you have
clear and uninterrupted view of
more peculiar and life-like representa-
tions than at any point”
“Which is Churchill, driver?”
“On the edge, madam, where the last
of the cliffs falls into the”
“Wonderful! I see it now —cigar and
all!” :,t
“Didn’t they call that Napoleon at
Elba? I thought that, years ago”
“No, sir. Napoleon is at Tumble-
down. .. Now follow the cliffs and you
will see the Dromedary—head and two
humps, plainly... No, sir, the dromedary
has two humps—you are probably think-
ing of the Siberian camel, which has only
one.”
“Oh, isn’t it fust lik§ a camel! ”
“Now, coming down the cliff, you see
the Ostrich —that dark marking on the
rock”
“Well, I never! Marvellous!”
“And below the Ostrich, just above the
tree-tops, is the Governors’ Cave. Yes,
that big dark opening in the”
“Which Governor was that, driver?”
“Joe,”
“Oh —you mean”
“Of course. Joe was the last of the
bushrangers, ladies and gentlemen. In
that very cave he and his brother Jacky
made their last stand... No, no, Ned
Kelly wasn’t the last, and they hanged
him at Glenrowan, if you remem-
ber” —
“My father was out after the Gover-
nors, and he said it was up Singleton
way.”
“Indeed, sir! It was a very long time
ago, ladies and gentlemen, and that is the
identical cave where the Governors made
their last stand.”
“They got them, driver?”
“Oh, yes. Both of them. Jacky shot
dead, and Joe was hanged at the old
Darlinghurst Jail. And now, on your left,
is the Queen of Sheba”
“You mean that marking on the cliff?”
“No, no, that is the Pawnshop—three
balls, you notice, ha, ha! The Queen of
Sheba is right above that —against the
skyline. She is seated and looking straight
at us.”
“Y-e-s, so it is.”
“And right at the end of the cliff is
Westminster Abbey. Those are the prin-
cipal sights from this particular point.”
* i A RE you sure, driver, they’ll have
fresh cream and apple pie today?”
“They never fail. From here, too, look-
ing down the valley, you can see Dibby’s
Farm.”
“Where we stop for the apple pie and
cream?”
“.That’s it —you can see the clearing
among the trees. Farmhouse just over
that hill.”
“Does the road take us right down
there?”
“There is no other way, madam.”
“Oh, my! What a fearful drop that
is!”
“A perfectly good road, madam —all
the way.”
The bus had pulled up after its negotia-
tion of a hairpin-bend, and was standing
on a ledge with the deep, narrow pass like
a gigantic gash in the solid earth, opening
and widening below till it finally ended
in little rolling hills, half-wooded, half
yellow and brown in the clearings.
The bus was a garish thing in bright
red —when dust did not lie too thickly
upon it. Three times daily it creaked and
groaned up and down McGregor’s, on a
road that was washed-out and rocky—
from the last storm, you know. There
was always a last storm, and the road was
always washed-out and rocky. The bus
was licensed, permitted or authorised to
carry 28 passengers. At the moment it
had 41, which was a mere nothing to what
it could do. There was no known limit
to what it could do.
The driver belonged to the rare and
inimitable class of Mountain Drivers.
Mountain Drivers are born that way.
Either you are born one or not. If not,
no training will ever make you the
genuine article. Mere skill in taking a
heavy and awkward vehicle packed with
sightseeing humanity up and down
dangerous grades is a small part of the
job. You have to be in addition diplo-
matist, historian, geologist and botanist.
You mustn’t be too young, for that
would attract the flappers, to the merited
rage of the spinsters—a proportion of
every load is spinster, who have always
loved the Mountains—just loved them.
You mustn’t be too old—for that would
destroy confidence, and might lead to
shrieking panic; you must have a past
with a large dash of romantic recklessness
in it, when you were known as the
Mountain Devil, or Hellfire Jack or some
such name that betokens a roaring career
round all the bends on two wheels —or
even one. Likewise, you must have a
future, for your sudden exit inevitably
means all the rest in the bus going with
you. You must have a sense of humor,
but not too much, for that will offend
some who haven’t any. You must be
witty, but not sufficiently so as to outdo
the funny man of the party —there is al-
ways a funny man, as much an institu-
tion in his way as the Mountain Driver
himself, and the funny man is always
called Herb or Tommy or just plain Jim.
You must know everyone and everything
on the mountains, the high folk and the
low and all the in-betweens. You must
remember all the names and past meet-
ings—“When you were here last year.
Miss Frost, with your mother”
“Yes, Miss Spooner, as I said to you in
June, the mountains are different all the
time, and winter is just as good”
And you must recall Mr, Slack quite
clearly, but you mustn’t remember that
he had a different girl with him last
Christmas; and you must take it as a
compliment, and a matter of course at
the same time, that Mr. Slack and Miss
Spooner call you “Jack,” and Miss Frost
knows you as “Mr. Gray”; and you
must be quite satisfied that elderly ladies
persist in the common name of “driver,”
and that smartish young fellows —whose
smartish cars are in dock at the moment
: —airily address you as “Joe” or “Bo” in
fiat contradiction to the evidence of Mr.
Slack and Miss Spooner; you must —
well, enough. But you must be half a
hundred other things as well. And, being
all these, you are eligible to drive a
Mountain bus and make it seem as desir-
able as the far more expensive “Easy-do
Tours” —narrow, low-slung speedy things
that career along like arrogant beetles.
JACK, or Mr. Gray, or Joe, or 80,
or just plain driver released the
brakes and the red bus lumbered down
the curving, snaking grade. Churchill,
cigar and all, the Dromedary, Queen of
Sheba, Kenilworth Castle and all the rest
of Nature’s wonderful carvings slipped
back, and were blotted out by the tower-
ing trees.
In the U-bends were trickles of water
that joined forces lower down to form
McGregor’s Creek ; sassafras and myrtle-
tree ferns and green mossy rocks featured
every such bend; and rotting logs.
covered with fungi and moss; brown
leaves turning into mould and making the
air dank and heavy, rich and somehow
deadly. On the elbows was the sun-
scorched sandstone, red, yellow and grey ;
and below were the tall grey gums with
airy drapings of thin and mournful bark.
Straights of short length here and there,
but mostly swings to the left, swings to
the right, with the tinted cliffs rising
higher every minute, and the valley—with
its apple pie and cream —correspondingly
closer. Chatter, talk and a hearty burst
of laughter as the funny man —Herb or
Tommy or just plain Jim —puts a good
one over. He is always putting a good
one over. Miss Spooner is explaining
something to Mr. Bodge. Mr. Bodge is
such a nice man —not young, of course —
been all over the world. Miss Spooner
is trying to remember what Wordsworth
said—or was it Byron? “About Melrose
Abbey—Kenilworth Castle back there,
you know, and all that.” Mr. Bodge
couldn’t remember the exact words—but
they were beautiful —he knew that. And
they both agreed that the words were
beautiful and apt and all that sort of
thing, and it’s just wonderful how ihe
words escape one even when they are on
the tip of the tongue.
Mr. Bodge has unwittingly slipped
into a middle-age of rather foolish
bachelordom, and has worked in the same*
place in the city since he was a boy, and
comes to the Mountains every year. So it
is not clear when he went all round the
world that time. He is not resigned yet
to a graceful relegation to a back-shelf,
and he is very nice to Miss Spooner even
while he gazes wistfully at the alluring
leg of the young thing with Mr. Slack.
Another loud laugh indicates a bull’s-
eye from the unerring aim of Herb, or
Tommy, or plain Jim. Mr. Bodge and
Miss Spooner smile tolerantly at one
another —they can afford to. And the
young thing’s leg is more alluring than
ever to the dimming eyes of Bodge.
Two ladies of generous beam have all
this while performed the miracle of fitting
their rear portions on to the totally in-
adequate same seat. They happen to be
at the same “guest”-house. Not a
“boarding”-house, mind. A guest-house.
As a matter of fact there are no board-
ing-houses any more. This wasn’t their
usual mode of travel at all, but in a way
it was fun when you come to think of it;
and one of them knew the Montagues at
Potts Point and the other was a great
friend of the Murgatroyds at Wah-
roonga. Fancy that! And the quips
and sallies of the funny man fell upon
their deaf ears. And, driver, are you sure
they will have apple pie and cream to-
day? Miss Diggle and Miss Lime
were directly behind these dreadnoughts
and their slim figures made the small seat
seem quite spacious. If base and vulgar
reflection could ever come their way they
might well calculate how much apple
pie and cream it would take to fill the two
battleships.
But Miss Diggle and Miss Lime were
above such thoughts. They went away
together every holiday, and had “done”
Cairns, and the Barrier Reef, and New
Zealand and Narooma and —in more
skittishly familiar phrase—Kossy and
Tassy. They were schoolteachers, and
desperately anxious to avoid tabulation
as such, though they carried with them
the dusty, gritty school, lesson-registers,
programmes, wall decorations, pedagogic
methods,-the Federation, the Inspectorial
System, and all the other marks and signs
of their calling.
They spoke of apple pie and cream in
a refined way, and replied to Mr. Bodge,
who was privileged, in the withered smiles
of the politeness that goes with female
pedagogy when it has passed that vague
thirty-ninth milestone.
* i \/OU two,” said Mr. Bodge with that
I ease and freedom born of Moun-
tain air and holiday spirit, “you two are
mighty quiet.” There was a rough raw
edge of familiarity to this, and perhaps
it should have been resented as such, but,
after all, Mr. Bodge was a man, and he
was taking notice of them. They threw
chalk-dusters and lesson-registers to the
winds, as it were, and smiled again. Miss
Diggle brushed aside the conventions that
she had for long secretly resented, and
spoke—“ But there are many others who
can make up for our deficiency in noise.”
“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Mr. Bodge.
“You think, instead of talking, and I can
guess what you are thinking of?”
“That is a daring venture,” said Miss
Diggle. “And what, pray, do you con-
sider we are thinking of?”
“Apple pie and cream! That’s what
you are thinking of. And if Jack doesn't
tip us all over the
side, it’s apple pie
and cream for yours
truly, too.”
“Who’s Jack?”
“Jack! Jack’s the
driver.”
“Oh.”
They were cruis-
ing round an elbow
at the moment with
a fearsome drop to
the right. The humor
of sudden death and
mutilation filled Mr.
Bodge. “If we went
over here there
wouldn’t be much
time to think of any-
thing. Not even
apple pie and cream,
hey! ”
“O-o-h! ”
With this cheering observation Mr.
Bodge returned his attention to Miss
Spooner, who greatly resented the intru-
sion of Miss Diggle and Miss Lime —
mentally summed up as awful frumps.
New and better views of the youarg thing's
leg stimulated Mr. Bodge and made him
more reckless and pleasant than ever.
The man whose father had been out
after those Governors was leaning for-
ward in an attempt to vindicate his
family’s honor, and he clung tenaciously
to the “back of Singleton” as the place
where the Governors were caught.
“Right through the Mount Royal
Ranges, my father often used to say”
“Of course I don't remember it myself,”
said the driver with easy tolerance, “and
you might be right, too. But it is common
knowledge about here”
“You wouldn’t be thinking of Ben Hall,
would you now?”
“No, it was the Governors.”
“My father used to say”
A long, straight, easy slope led to the
floor of the valley and the bus rattled
down it at the best speed it had so far
accomplished. “Won’t be so long now,”
chanted the funny man, “as the Rabbi
said.” The young things laughed under-
standingly at the wicked allusion.
FENCES-7-mostly broken down-
appeared and clearings—cultivations
once —and blackberries and bracken. A
bony cow or two made stolid appraisal
of the bus. A tumbledown house and a
tumbledown cowshed and a tumbledown
pigsty were the first signs of settlement
once.
“The old Dewey home!” called Ae
driver. “Judge Dewey was born there.”
Everyone looked. It didn’t seem much
of a place for a Judge to be born in.
The funny man made appropriate remark
about it.
More clearings, more deserted holdings,
more tumbledown houses and plenty more
bracken and blackberries. Especially
blackberries. They now hid the fences,
swallowed up the straggling cherry- and
apple-trees, and laid very successful siege
to the ancient dwelling places. The road
was a mere slit-trench between tall banks
of blackberries.
“This,” said the driver, “is a wonderful
place for blackberries.”
“There it is now!” and the driver
nodded at a flag on a long thin pole that
rose out of the blackberries. At a break
in the hedge was a gateway, and above
it a big tin sign—“ Texas Ranch. Teas.
Apple Pie and Cream.”
“Hooray!” went up a cheer, hearty but
discordant.
The bus turned in under the sign, and
wove in and out among the clumps ot
blackberries. Texas Ranch was on a
knoll, and so far had resisted the in-
cursions of the eternal blackberries. It
was a farm —“Lovely! A real farm!
but the usual evidences of farming opera-
tions were not obvious. Still, there must
be an apple orchard • somewhere, and a
patient herd of sleek cows concentrating
on their duties of providing cream for

hands over fhe key of yet another completed
Housing Commission home.
To achieve the States’ targets of tens of thousands of homes per year,
brick pits and timber mills, coal mines and cement quarries, steel
works and glass works, gas, water and electricity undertakings all over
the Commonwealth are enlisting the aid of Caterpillar power,
performance and economy.
New homes are springing up by the thousand, streets of new houses,
houses by the townful! State Housing Commissions and civic building
authorities are striving to fulfil the nation’s urgent need for all those
vital structures essential to rapidly expanding settlements and an ever-
growing population.
Never in times of peace was there such urgent need of economical
power—power in the forests and the timber mills, in brick yards and
quarries, in the mines and the works and utilities where tireless,
reliable power is vital to speed production of materials for homes. In
thousands of such projects and enterprises, "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors, "Caterpillar” Diesel Engines and Earth-Moving Equipment
serve, bringing to whatever the gruelling job, in however rough a
terrain, the tremendous strength, tireless power, easy mobility and
speed that give all-weather performance and reliability with an
economy in maintenance and fuel £’s that builds profits onto
streamlined efficiency.

THE HOUSE OF FEAR.
Thus N. Y. “Times” headed
its leading article dealing with
the desperate escape, of the
Russian schoolteacher Mrs.
Kasenkina from the Soviet Con-
sulate in New York.
The strik ng editorial referred
not only Soviet Consulate
as a ; of Fear for the
woman he; a mere as a prisoner ;
it extended the application to the
larger prison walled by the “iron
curtain.”
The case of the escaped Rus-
sian schoolteachers —leading to,
among other things, blunt U.S.
insistence on the recall to
Moscow of the Consul involved
and to the Kremlin closing its
U.S. Consulates remains a
live issue in the U.S. press
and broadcasts. One thing
regarding it seems to need
emphasising—it should not be
confused with the also-current
“spy-ring” case; they are not
directly related.
The “spy-ring” case concerns
charges by ex - Communist
former members of it that the
“ring” operated in America in
much the same way as the one
in Canada did ; in fact, informa-
tion to that effect was passed on
to U.S. authorities by Canada at
the time. The implication is
being broadly made in various
U.S. newspapers and other
quarters that deliberate sup-
pression by interested parties
prevented earlier action on that
information and on other in-
formation which has been in the
hands of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for as long as nine
years. An interesting point re-
garding this is that the F.B.L
is exactly what its name indicates
—that is, an investigating, and
not a prosecuting, agency. It
can hand on the results of its in-
vestigations to the responsible
departments, but it is up to these
to prosecute.
The “spy-ring” case involves
charges against a score or more
Americans alleged to have acted
as some Canadians were proved
to have acted as friends of Soviet
Russia and traitors to their
country. Because Of the number
involved, the amount of investi-
gation that has been done and
the charges of suppression of
action, the “spy-ring” case is
very likely to drag on for
months.
The also-current trials of
leading U.S. Communists may
be a further point of possible
confusion. These, also, are
separate; except, of course, as
all these things trace back to
Russia. The'Communists were
rounded up for trial on what
amount to charges of con-
spiracy aiming at the overthrow
of the American government
system. As already explained in
an “Uncabled Additions” item,
the rounding-up was carried out
under a special Act passed in
1940.
These points of possible con-
fusion having been cleared away,
the case of the Russian school-
teachers escaping from their
House of Fear stands out on its
own ; even more significant and
interesting than the spying and
Communist - conspiracy cases,
since these are, after all, by now
only too familiar,
Soviet Russia has had 2000
nationals in the U.S. connected
with Government business, snd
until recently a private school
for the children of some of these
was conducted in New York,
with nine teachers and about
100 pupils. A few months back
the N. Y. city authorities con-
demned the building as unsuit-
able for school purposes; there-
upon the Russians decided to
shut down the school, and all
teachers and pupils were ordered
back to Russia.
After the ship, the Pobeda,
had sailed from New York dn
July 31, it was found that three
of the teachers had “missed the

“MORE! MORE! I’M HUNGRY!”
boat”—Mrs. Kasenkina, Mikhail
Samarin and Mrs. Samarin (plus
three Samarin children). The
sensational details of the subse-
quent story of Mrs. Kasenkina
were given in cables —her find-
ing sanctuary at the farm-rest-
home run for similar exile-
Russians by Countess Tolstoy
(daughter of the author. Count
Leo Tolstoy); the woman
teacher’s removal from there in,
a Soviet Consulate car ; her sub-
sequent desperate leap from the
third-floor of the Soviet Con-
sulate building, after the Consul,
Lomakin, had refused to obey a
Court order to produce her ; the
critically injured woman stating
to the Soviet Vice-Consul per-
mitted to see her in hospital,
“You kept me a prisoner ; you
would not let me go”; and,
finally, the U,S. demand for
Lomakin’s recall to Moscow.
The Samarins’ escape was not
given much space in cables. It
lacked the sensational window-
leap of the other, but it provides
every bit as interesting a story,
the obvious main point of differ-
ence being that Samarin all
through was a different pro-
position for the Soviet net to re-
capture —a cool escaper, very
different from the distracted
woman teacher.
Two weeks before the Pobeda
sailed (this is from the N. Y.
“Times” account) the Samarin
family sent its luggage aboard,
saving only a few clothes in a
suitcase. At half-past midnight,
July 30 —the eve of the sailing
—the Samarins quit their apart-
ment on West 104th-street.
Under arrangements made by
friends, they were hidden in
a truck loaded with vegetables
and taken to a farm near Free-
hold, N.J.
For a week the Samarins
stayed at the farm without any
inkling that Consul Lomakin had
disclosed that they were “miss-
ing” ; the first they heard of the
Kasenkina affair was from a car-
load of anti-Communist Russians
who had arrived at the farm
and excitedly warned them that
they might also be kidnapped.
Mrs. Samarin and her children
were removed to another farm
near by. Samarin hastened to
New York by devious routes.
He moved about frequently,
snatching meals of sandwiches
and coffee, and finally made
contact with the F. 8.1. and asked
for protection.
Taken by an intermediary to
the N. Y. “Times” office,
Samarin there declared that he
did not want to return to Russia.
He said that “the party, police
and Government machinery of
the Soviet Union [are] operating
against the best interests of my
country and my people.”
At the insistence of the Soviet
Consulate, the New York police
conducted a search for Samarin,
but an intermediary arranged to
have the teacher subpoenaed by
the House Committee of Un-
American Activities. 'The sub-
poena, which would protect him
from seizure by either the police
or the “Red” Russians, was
handed to Samarin by a repre-
sentative of the House com-
mittee. They shook hands and
the Russian said: “Thank you.”
Then he went back into hiding.
Thus the cooler Samarin kept
himself and his family free. On
them and the less-fortunate
woman, and the Soviet House
of Fear in New York and at
large, N. Y. “Times” editorially
commented:
“These events, happening in
free America, horrify us. The
shock is intensified when Foreign
Minister Molotov demands that
these refugees be ‘liberated’ for
deportation to Russia. We know
the probable nature of such
‘liberation’ —the executions or
the > living death of the labor
camps reserved for those who
dare to differ with the Moscow
Government. We know, too,
why this ‘liberation’ is sought.
It is because these witnesses are
able to testify in damning terms
against the tyranny which has
been clamped down on the
Russian people. Mrs. Kasenkina
and the Samarins have preferred
freedom ; that is their crime. It
is not a crime, as the State De-
partment has assured them, for
which they will be driven out of
this country. On the contrary,
we respect them for it.
“This incident of a desperate
woman seeking or risking death
comes home to us because it
occurs in a house on one of our
own streets It may startle
some readers more than the
suicide or murder of a Czech
patriot, more than the flight of
Czech aviators into countries
more friendly and more free
than their own now is, more
than the countless slaves in
Russia itself, more than the
countless dead whose offence
was a belief in something
like the Bill of Rights
or perhaps merely in some
variant of the official Communist
creed. It is human nature to
find a tragedy under our
windows more shocking than a
multitude of tragedies far away.
“Nevertheless, it will be bene-
ficial for us to remember that the
fear that was in Mrs. Kasen-
kina’s heart was but an extension
of the fear with which millions
of people today, in Communist-
dominated countries, rise and eat
and work and go to bed. From
this larger House of Fear there
is almost no escape. In Russia
itself a whole generation has
been born in it and has grown
accustomed to it. But the fear
is there—the fear to talk, the
fear of strangers, the fear even
to think lest the thought be
wrong and some chance expres-
sion betray it.”
Also on what N. Y. “Times”
further referred to as “the vaster
House of Fear that has been
erected stone by stone since 1917
and extended by breach of faith
since 1945,” N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” commented, concern-
ing the Soviet teachers’ case, that
this threw a “lurid illumination
over the Soviet system, and over
the manners and methods of
the grim and conspiratorial dic-
tatorship with which our demo-
cracy is trying to deal
That the teachers should have
risked so much in order for ever
to exile themselves from their
own land speaks eloquently
enough as to the Soviet paradise.
The relentlessness with which the
Consulate sought to recover
them is more eloquent still. Mrs.
Kasenkina was willing to risk
suicide to escape. The Ambas-
sador of the Soviet Union, un-
able either to recapture Mr.
Samarin or stop his mouth, un-
hesitatingly tried to brand him
as mentally irresponsible. This
accusation, readily disproved,
was as stupid as Molotov’s own
frenetic protest, tending simply
to complete the whole picture of
oppression, mendacity, brutal
disregard of individual right and
cowering timidity in the face of
any possible revelation of the
truth.
“It is a picture which will not
soon be effaced. While it has
nothing directly to do with the
allegations as to war-time Soviet
espionage in Washington, it
tends to set these allegations in
a clearer perspective. This is the
kind of system that was at work
among us. That it trapped some
Americans into espionage against
their country can no longer
easily be doubted.”
The whole sensational sto^y —
of the escaping Soviet teachers,
the U.S. spy-ring and that of
Canada, and the actions against
the leading American Com-
munists—makes its own com-
ment on that smuggest of smug
definitions, Mr. Chifley’s “poli
tical philosophy.” It explains,
too, why the U.S. flatly refuses
to share military secrets with Mr.
Chifley’s Australia.
Comrades’ Comfort.
Parts of the “Uncabled Addi-
tions” article “Berlin Bungle”
(B. 18/8/’4B) so pleased the
Communist “Tribune” (Sydney)
that it ran an article paraphrase
ing and quoting the parts Mt
found pleasing.
The “Uncabled Additions”
article demonstrated two facts;
(1) The unhappy position the
Western Powers have had to sup-
port in Berlin because their
representatives, in the first flush
of victory, trusted the Russians’
word, only to have it proved, by
violation after violation, even
less trustworthy and as con-
temptible as Hitler’s; (2) The
widespread reluctance for war,
expressled in acts and quoted
comments, of the disillusioned
Western Powers, so patient for
peace even now that only de-
liberate Russian aggression can
force the world into the
shambles of another war.
The “Tribune’s” co-operation
in further publicising those im-
portant facts isi appreciated, as
also is the evidence of the Com-
rades’ desperation, reduced to
grasping at such cold comfort.
The two facts referred to are
incontestable. As to the first of
them, the U.S, Department of
State has published a long list
of 37 major violations of Mos-
cow’s pledged word, giving in
each instance the terms of the
pledge and beside it the nature
and date of the violation. The
bare truth is that to date Russia
has failed to honor a single im-
portant pledge!
Regarding the other outstand-
ing fact of the current interna-
tional scene —the widespread re-
luctance for war in the “Wes-
tern” countries —this is shown
by the extraordinary restraint
and patience in the face of
provocation so strong (as in the
kidnappings and other acts in
Berlin and elsewhere) as to sug-
gest deliberate intent to provoke
retaliation, thus providing some
excuse for a Russian-desired
war.
The reluctance is also shown
in many comments, particularly
in the American press. In fact,
there has been considerable ad-
vocacy of what would amount
to further attempts to appease
the ravenous Bear; “conces-
sions” has become a common-
place word in a wide range of
comment.
The Moscow palavers had
strong advance approval in the
U.S.; all the more remarkable
in suggesting that the State De-
partment’s publication of the
almost incredibly long and
general list of Soviet treaty-
violations had misfired. Many,
apparently, were ready to believe
that the Kremlin would hence-
forth honor its pledges —a strik-
ing example of the persistence
of human faith, if nothing else.
One notable exception from
the U.S. appeasement front has
been former Under-Secretary of
State Sumner Welles. “Whatever

settlements the Kremlin may
now propose,” Welles has
insisted in N. Y. “Herald Tri-
bune,” “whatever apparent con-
cessions it may authorise Molo-
tov to offer, it has but one ob-
jective in view. Short of war,
it is only through the control of
Germany that the Soviet Union
can still hope to dominate
Europe.”
Opposing the notion that “if
we can secure the withdrawal of
the Red armies from central
Europe in return for a Western
withdrawal, the key to world
peace will have been found,”
Welles contends that until the
Soviet dictatorship has shown
by performance that it has
finally renounced its policy of
aggressive expansion, the with-
drawal by the United States of
its military forces from Europe
would be a suicidal mistake.
“Until Moscow is willing to
enter into such test commit-
ments as the project for the in-
ternational control of atomic
energy approved by a majority
of the Security Council, to liqui-
date the Cominform, to aban-
don its present course in Eastern
Europe, Greece, Iran, China and
Korea and to promote world
peace and world recovery rather
than world conflict and world
ruin the evacuation of the
American armies from Europe
would mean our abandonment
of Europe to Soviet domina-
tion.”
Declaring that the “pressure
to accept Soviet offers at their
face value” would come from
many quarters, Welles added:
“If the United States falls into
the pit the Soviet Union is pre-
paring the course of future
events can readily be forecast.
Once an all-German Govern-
ment is re-established in Berlin
the Kremlin will seek by every
means at its disposal to cajole or
to force the German people into
its grasp so as to make of Ger-
many that ‘principal link in the
chain of revolutions’ which
Lenin prophesied.”
Satellite Squeeze.
A “U.S. News and World
Report” general survey of the
countries in the Russian bloc in
their relations with Moscow —
based on reports from Belgrade,
Prague and Zurich and informa-
tion obtained in Washington—
suggests that the Bear is squeez-
ing its hives to the last drop of
honey.
Finland is held to be better off
than most of the other satellites,
Russia using it to get goods
from the West. Finland already
has paid off half of the
5300,000,000 that Russia de-
mands in reparations, and Russia
has cut the balance in half. But
Russia wants to be paid mainly
in machinery and other goods
that Finland can get only by
trading with the West, and the
Western countries are beginning
to select their exports to Finland,
holding out on the things Russia
wants most.
Poland is bound by agree-
ments that benefit Russia, not
Poland. Part of Poland’s coal,
for example, is sold to Russia at
about $1.50 a ton. The normal
export price is $l2 a ton. But
Poland is required to pay Russia
the world price for oil, from
wells that once belonged to
Poland. In addition, the Poles,
who were to get a share of the
reparations Russia is taking out
of Germany, are receiving little
that the Russians themselves
could use. As a result, Poland
is seeking credits in the U.S., and
is trying to expand her trade with
Western Europe. -
Czechoslovakia is forced to
sell her industrial products to
Russia at about half the world
price, but is required to pay
50 per cent, more than the world
price for Russian grain. In-
flation is sapping the Czecho-
slovak economy. Consumer
goods are getting scarce' because
so much of the country’s output
is going to Russia. And the
Communist Government, despite
its control of the police and the
Army, is worried by frequent
anti-Russian demonstrations.
In Hungary, occupied by
Russia as an ex-enemy country,
Russia is squeezing out the
country’s wealth and productive
capacity, not only through re-
parations, occupation costs and
one-way trade, but also through
Russian control of companies
that operate a large part of
Hungary’s industry.
Yugoslavia the survey depicts
as having had enough of one-
way trade with Russia. Yugoslav
raw materials, mainly copper,
which commands good prices in
the West, have gone to Russia
—London "Daily Mail.”
THE TEMPTATION OF TITO.
in large quantities on the
promise of tractors and other
machinery in return, but Russia
has delivered little. Now, fol-
lowing the open break between
Yugoslavia’s Communist party
and Moscow, the Yugoslavs
have sent a trade mission to
Belgium and are looking for
trade with the U.S.
Russia is proposing to take
over Yugoslavia’s shares in
Albanian oil companies, and
there is no sign that Albania will
get much in return. Albania has
a trade mission in Moscow, but
the Russians have only military
and cultural missions in Albania.
Bulgaria, which depends
largely on tobacco for her trade
abroad, is sending much of it to
Russia in exchange for textiles
and other goods, but the Bulgars
are getting only half the amount
of goods from Russia that they
could get for their tobacco from
buyers outside the Soviet orbit.
Rumania is shown as being
exploited more ruthlessly than
are any of the other satellites.
Inflation is encouraged by a
heavy burden of occupation
costs, reparations and one-way
trade. The country is close to
bankruptcy. Virtually all of
Rumania’s oil goes to Russia for
resale in Europe or for use by
the Russian armies outside the
Soviet Union. Russia has built
a pipeline from the Rumanian
fields at Ploesti to the Russian
port of Odessa on the Black Sea.
But wasteful Russian methods
of extracting oil, plus lack of
drilling machinery, much of
which was taken off to Russia,
are cutting down Rumanian oil
output. Rumania’s grain ex-
ports, main source of wealth of
the country, also are going ‘to
Russia, partly for use by the
Soviet forces in Eastern Europe
and partly for sale to other
satellite States by the Russians.
Rumanian peasants, lacking
goods to buy, are producing less
food for sale.
In all, the survey finds,
Russia has taken more than
$ 13,500,000,000-worth of raw
materials, food, machinery and
goods out of Eastern Europe as
war-booty, reparations and occu-
pation costs. Under this “man-
agement” the satellite countries
are going broke. “They'are urg-
ing Moscow to come to terms
with the West so that they can
get the machinery and raw
materials that Russia cannot
supply. They are groaning under
a one-way trade that profits only
Russia.”
Thus, while Western Europe,
with U.S. help, is surpassing pre-
war levels of production and
making rapid strides toward re-
covery, Eastern Europe is mak-
ing no such progress. As one of
the most important examples,
Western Germany, encouraged
by currency reform, is beginning
to hum again, while Eastern
Germany, stripped of much of
its productive machinery by
Russia, is close to economic col-
lapse.
The survey finds reconstruc-
tion of the economy of Eastern
Europe too big a job for Russia
to tackle alone. “Not for 10
years if then can Russia
supply the capital goods needed
by Eastern Europe without cut-
ting into her own economic plan-
ning.” Hence “a truce that
w'ould permit the development of
East-West trade is ardently de-
sired by most of Russia’s
satellites. Trouble now develop-
ing in Eastern Europe gives
Russia good reason to come to
terms with the U.S. and the
West on the whole of Europe.”
In Occupied Japan.
In Japan the fourth year of
occupation is now under way,
with a peace treaty apparently
as remotely distant as ever,
though more than a year back
General MacArthur deplored the
long occupation as “demoralising
both to the conquered and the
conqueror.”
Reporting • from Tokyo, a
correspondent of N. Y. “Times”
states that *the Japs themselves
undoubtedly realise the benefits
the occupation has brought them
despite its annual cost of about
one-quarter of the total national
budget. The presence of United
States and British troops on Jap-
anese soil is the sole guarantee
of peace for a nation that under
its own new Constitution has
been disarmed “for ever.”
Easily balancing the occupa-
tion cost to the Japs, the U.S.
has poured food and supplies
into Japan probably far exceed-
ing that cost in value. The N. Y.
“Times” man adds that
“Thoughtful Japanese know, too,
that United States plans for
Japan’s future are far more
generous than those of any other
Allied nation”
As for the political set-up,
though on the surface the Japs
have a new Constitution, a
democratically - elected Parlia-
ment and a number of compet-
ing political parties, in actuality
there has been little change since
November, 1945, when the Joint
Chiefs-of-Staffs ordered General
MacArthur to govern through
but not support the existing
Japanese Government. All
major policy still is made by the
occupation authorities, and even
the most minor detail is checked
and counter-checked on local
levels by Military Government
teams in all prefectures.
“The result is that the Jap Par-
liament remains largely a rubber-
stamp for the Cabinet it elects,
which in turn is a rubber-stamp
for the occupation authorities.
This is a situation that may ex-
plain why the platforms of the
Japanese political parties mean
little and internal politics revolve
largely around policies rather
than issues—which are decided
in General MacArthur’s head-
quarters.”
The correspondent finds that
most Japanese, “always with the
exception of those guided by the
new Communist ultra-nationalist
line,” certainly do not wish to
see the Allied troops withdrawn
without some form of interna-
tional defence pledge for their
disarmed nation.
“What is being discussed to-
day is rather to what extent Jap-
anese rehabilitation-• will be
financed and aided by the United
States, to what extent Japan
will be permitted to trade and
to what extent will the nation
again become the ‘workshop of
Asia’ in advance of treaty
negotiations.”
Regarding both that and the
eventual peace treaty, Russian
obstruction is seen as a compara-
tively minor hurdle: “There are
large differences among the
Allies regarding the extent to
which Japan will rebuild. A
settlement of this question on a
basis favorable to Japan prob-
ably would please most Japanese
even more than the conclusion
of a treaty and the withdrawal
of the Allies’ armed protection.”

Tito Plays Safe. —Reported by
N. Y. “Times,” the Tito defiance of
Moscow, made before a congress of
his Com. supporters, must have been
a good show in its way, Tito stand-
ing for “almost eight hours before
some 20Q0 wildly-cheering delegates,
who hailed him as a national hero
and hurled defiance at the Soviet-
dominated Communist International.”
But Tito was taking no unnecessary
risks: “To show that he knew his
Communists and was prepared for all
eventualities, he spoke surrounded by
the greatest military display seen in
Yugoslavia since the war, including
a ring of anti-aircraft batteries ready
to repel any planes bringing ‘com-
radely’ greetings, from Moscow,”

success against the Communist guer-

“Times” letter: “The [Russian] pres-
sure on Greece seems to be relaxed,
probably because Russia has been
presented gratis with a master-key
which will open the door for her into
the garden of the Middle East—
namely, the Zionist organisation in
Palestine.”

Concerning Nuremberg. Field-
Marshal Lord Montgomery cuts
through a lot of fancy camouflage in
his direct fashion: “The Nuremberg

cessful war a crime; the generals of
the defeated side are tried and then

Food for Britain. —All who con-
tribute to the worthiest of causes
should be further encouraged by an
extract from a London “Times” letter
written by two members of the
C.W.A. of Victoria, Flora Nixon and
Eileen Storer: “We have come to
Britain on holiday and while here
have visited several food distributions
to elderly and needy folk. It is grand
to see how well these distributions
are carried out —so much thought and
work goes into it —to ensure that the
food goes where it is most needed.
It is the old folk, who have borne the
heat and burden of the day and who
no longer can make the most of the
little they have, who need the extra
food. The Ministry of Food is see-
ing that they are getting it.”

Britain’s Levellers. —Whatever effect
it’s going to have on traditional
Britain in the long run, the Socialist
levelling-down process is fast wiping
out the wealthy. • Figures quoted by
“U.S. News and World Report” show
45 persons with net incomes, after
taxes, of £6OOO or more in Britain
this year, compared with 7000 in 1939,
and 840 with £4OOO to £6OOO, com-
pared with 12,000 in that pre-war
year. In still higher brackets the
“temporary” capital-levy tax* means
that more will be paid in taxes this
year than is received in income. At
the other extreme of the levelling,
13,827,000 are collecting under £lOOO,
compared with 6,770,000 in this
bracket in 1939.

"Unconditional” Boomerang.
Pointing out that “the situation in
Berlin arises from policies which were
not thought through when adopted;
policies, the possibilities of which were
not foreseen, or if foreseen were
disregarded by some process of
thought in which hope superseded
logic,” “Wall-street Journal” quotes
as an example a once much-trumpeted
declaration: “The policy of, ‘un-
conditional surrender’ all but pre-
cluded any German Government
through which the conquerors of
Germany could act as has been the
case in Japan. Direct try
the conquerors became inevitable” —
and friction and disagreement also.
* * * *
"Cold” Dewey. —London “Times”
U.S. correspondent isn’t as hard on
Dewey as the current American wise-
crack: “Dewey, if elected, will be
the greatest President since Harry
Truman”; even so, the “Times” man
sees a flaw or two. Admitting that
the Republicans have “chosen a man
who can win the election without
difficulty,” and commenting on his
being “the first unsuccessful can-
didate who has ever been allowed
a second chance by the Republican
party,” he adds: “This would
suggest that Dewey is an un-
usually popular man, and a man of
outstanding personality. Yet that is
by no means the case. He is, and
always has been, disliked by many
in the party, and has a reputation for
coldness, which is not belied in his
public appearances.” •

“FOR THIS ‘RELIEF’ MUCH THANKS.”
“Given a warning to take their choice of getting out of the Australian-Russian Society or resigning their A.L.P. membership, N.S.W. Minister Clive Evatt, the society 's
president, and Federal Minister Ward, vice-president, were ‘relieved’ of these positions by the society itself.”
“Happy landings, Comrades!”

ARBITRATION'S WRECKERS.
In nothing has the Chifley “Government
served Australian industry worse than
in its mutilation of such system or
authority as the Federal Arbitration
Court had established over a period of
40 years. The community is now paying
the piper, without having called the tune,
in increasing indiscipline and discontent,
the result largely of the opportunity
which “Labor” afforded confessed
wreckers to develop their own destructive
campaign.
From the day, nearly two years ago,
when the Chifley Cabinet surrendered to
union pressure in the matter of the 40-
hour week, Ministers have been helpless
and hopeless. Under the false slogan
of “bringing about contentment in in-
dustry,” Dr. Evatt drafted and forced
through Parliament his bill to substitute
Conciliation Commissioners for the
Arbitration Bench. To Communists
ruling certain unions, who had announced
that they would have nothing more to
do with the Court, the “Government”
yielded again by establishing special
tribunals to whose panels the wreckers
were to appoint their own nominees. All
this in facS" of cynical avowals by these
“mimicking Molotovs” that they were
out to destroy arbitration and substitute
direct bargaining with employers under
union blackmail.
The wreckers have marked for destruc-
tion not only arbitration, but also the
craft unions themselves; these being de-
clared “obsolete as a working-class
weapon”—a “weapon,” not an organism
in industrial society! By no possible
excuse can political “Labor” —which
owes its existence to the betrayed trade-
union members —pretend that it was
ignorant of what it was doing. Sentence
of death on the craft unions, and their
remodelling on the lines of the Com-
munists’ own system of industrial group-
ing, is written in the “Labor” party’s
Socialist objective with which, in 1921,
the A.L.P. cast itself into the political
wilderness for most of 20 years.
Another generation of electors has now
to be instructed in the evil that ensues
from trusting such a “Labor” party.
Under the Chifley regime Parliamentary
authority has been surrendered to the
Reds, and “Labor” has accepted the
Reds’ “philosophy” of sabotage of the
existing order. To stave off its own fate,
political “Labor” will even abandon the
unions to these dingoes.
Let the case of the Building Workers’
Industrial Union stand as the latest
horrible example.
For the past two years this Communist-
bossed outfit, having mopped up the old
and respected craft unions in the build-
ing trade, has been flagrantly defying the
Arbitration Court, the “Government”
and the community at large on whose
behalf the “Government” gave war-time
pledges to young servicemen.
The Full Bench of the Arbitra-
tion Court has now deregistered the
8.W.1.U., which the Court declared,
in language of regret', f was “all
it could do.” Deregistration is the climax
to a record of defiance against two State
industrial authorities, three Conciliation
Commissioners and two Arbitration
Judges. The 8.W.1.U., Judge Foster de-
clared, had committed every outrage
against the rule of industrial law, with
bans on jobs, blackmail of employers,
announcement that it would pursue its
ends by force alone, and (as Judge Kirby
said in corroboration) “persistence in open
rebellion against the system of arbi-.
tration.”
Having landed 40,000 members in this
fix, the spokesman for the Communist
bosses retorted that tlieir campaign would
go ahead despite the Court’s decision,
that he was not worried by statements that
the union could not sue for dues, or by
the possibility that the carpenters, for
instance, might seek re-registration tor
their own union. They have the indi-
vidual cowed, Moscow-fashion.
This is the gang of wreckers whom,
for eight months, Mr. Dedman, the
Minister who administers what he once
called the “Ex-servicemen’s Charter,” has
been sheltering and condoning with ex-
cuses that the Commonwealth ex-service-
men’s training scheme is stalled because
of shortage of materials!
Two years ago the Victorian branch
of the 8.W.1.U. attempted to introduce,
outside the Court, a scheme to enforce
job-control upon employers. Apparently,
though this is not clear, the direct-
actionists had success with some
employers. When the Timber Merchants
resisted and took the matter to the
Arbitration Court, Judge Kelly declared
that the union had committed breaches
of the award, and on its leaders’
continued defiance he deleted certain
clauses of the award granting right
of entry to post notices and right to in-
spect employers’ wage-sheets. This, he
said, was a disciplinary measure, and the
union could, on giving assurances for
future good behavior, apply for reinser-
tion of the clauses.
Not till a year later, in August, 1947,
did the union make such application, and
then in such a manner that the Court
was not satisfied. The 8.W.1.U. at this
stage brazenly demanded new wage con-
cessions and the removal of Judge Kelly
from the Bench. In January this year it
proceeded to vent its spite on the com-
munity by refusing, through its repre-
sentatives on the Commonwealth rehabili-
tation training committees, to approve
any further instruction of trainees for the
Timber Merchants’ employment, excuse
being “no jobs,” though employers were
short-handed and thousands of trainees
were either doing the courses or waiting
to begin.
Three months ago, when employers in
Victoria charged the 8.W.1.U. before
Conciliation Commissioner Galvin with
“a direct attempt to destroy arbitration
and substitute industrial blackmail,” the
union representative refused even to
answer the evidence, and the Commis-
sioner directed that the papers in the
case should be sent to the Attorney-
General.
The Attorney-General, self-expatri-
ated to the limelight of U.N.0., has, of
course, done nothing. Mr. Dedman, his
servicemen’s training scheme ditched, has
done nothing. The cost of Government
home-building is soaring beyond hope of
economic rentals, (except under subsidy
from taxation) for workers’ families, and
even the precious McGirr Government in
N.S.W. was found the other day to be
rack-renting Government houses. All
these Socialist mountebanks in office are
secretly appalled by the devastation to
their works programmes and Budgets
and transport staffs by the 40-hour-week
fraud, which they foisted on the country
without a shred of a plan for meeting its
impact upon their own public services.
, The 8.W.1.U. campaign is only one
instance of Communist tactics which
ought to stir to action any self-respect-
ing Government. The coalminers have
made mockery of the host of special tri-
bunals and “authorities” appointed to
prevent those recurring stoppages which
have reduced all industry to absolute de-
pendence on the whims of the miners.
The era of the special stevedoring and
shipping tribunals is one in which freight
and handling costs and delays' on the
wharves have made the sea-transport
business a life of luxury for the unions,
and especially the union bosses.
Another Communist-run union, the
Sheet Metal Workers, has just agreed to
settle an eight weeks’ utterly illegal strike
at the Orange (N.S.W.) Electric Meter
works on terms which the company had
offered at the outset. A further instance
is the dragging job-control strike at the
Clyde Engineering Works.
All these are but symptoms of a dis-
order widespread through what was 1 once
at least a coherent, if imperfect, system
of arbitration law. In the Government
programme for the Federal session now
opened there is not a hint of any measure
to enforce that discipline without which
arbitration —streamlined or not —is be-
coming an utter mockery.
Burma and British Policy.
Any chorus of fatheads demanding
“freedom” for some race quite unfit to
govern itself and living in relative peace
and order only because of British rule
has had the Attlee Government’s ear.
And devastating have been the results to
the integrity of the British Common-
wealth.
The Attlees abandoned India without
safeguards and at the shortest notice;
it is not their fault that the whole coun-
try is not plunged in the misery of civil
war, as it may be yet, and as some of it
is already. The advice of men who had
lived in India for a generation or more
disregarded, during the changeover the
Punjab became a blood-bath in which
more lives were lost than on the Allied
side in the Pacific War. Whitehall
Socialists virtually deserted the princes
who had long since become as loyally
British as any subjects of the King-
Emperor. Those petty fnonarchs may
not all have possessed the right ideals
of “democratic” government as under-
stood in Canberra and Limehouse, but
they were at least ready to be benign to
their subjects under British tutelage.
By allowing India to tear up its anchor-
roots, to divide itself at the behest of
what was, after all, only a handful of
mob-rousing orators in whose absence
quiet would have reigned, the Attlee
Government opened the way to a chaos
which every Communist in Asia is trying
to capitalise and the consequences erf
which no man can foresee.
The same has happened in other parts
of Asia. In China treaty rights were
given up without a murmur on the
ground that this was the democratic will
of the who are about as suscep-
tible to democracy, as the West under-
stands it, as Mr. Chifley is to persuasion
along the lines of reason. The answer to
that policy has been the awful chaos,
starvation and dirt, the dreadful inflation
and the hopeless lawlessness which now
afflict the city of the Whangpoo. The
contrast is provided by Hong Kong, into
W'hich— still British —every Chinese along
the Pearl River for a hundred miles seems
to be anxious to cram himself.
In Malaya, post-war recognition of the
bandit Communist “army” of the occu-
pation period, which spent much more
time in intimidating Malays than it did in
fighting Japanese, gave its members a
sufficient status to enable them to lay the
groundwork for their present bloody
policy, of which the modus operandi 4s
terrorism and the objective not merely to
oust the white race but to oust it with an
ignominy which will produce contempt
for Europeans and respect for and fear of
operating Communists among Asiatics.
As in Palestine, the Government is act-
ing, but too late, and at a period when
Britain needs every man it can keep at
home for defence and industrial purposes.
With the Suez Canal jeopardised and
the foothold in Egypt given away,
the Royal Navy largely scrapped,
the Army and the Air Force en-
feebled almost to the point of
futility in the face of the magnitude of
the present emergencies, the British would
be forced to abandon Asia altogether if
there were war in Europe. But this might
not matter much. It is no longer a source
of strong Indian armies such as those
which have twice assisted in the subduing
of Germany, no longer a mainly British
source of materials, such as rubber—of
which the bulk is now going to Russia
and the United States.
True, Malaya is vital to the safety of
Australia, the Asian jumping-off place
for its invasion, but the Attlees are un-
likely to worry about that, especially
since the present Australian Prime
Minister is one of their own breed and
has: never thought Malaya worth defend-
ing, except in 1942. His latest viewpoint
is exactly the Communist one —6,000,000
are burning to shake off the “yoke” of
17,000 Europeans, some of whom have
gone there for “profit”—which, of
course, is shocking to the leader of the
party, but (all too obviously of late) not
so distressing to some of its members.
Actually the Malays have shown little
disposition for “freedom” ; the agitation
comes from the Chinese and the criminal
classes.
The crowning folly of British and
Australian policy in Asia, however, is
not in Malaya or India, but in Burma.
There it was obvious from the first to
anybody with a pair of eyes that those
who demanded “freedom” were Com-
munists in disguise and Japanese col-
laborators of much the same vintage as
the Republicans of Java.
One of the patriots who was involved
in the “freedom” movement, a man who
had accepted office as Premier under
British rule, who had collaborated with
the enemy and who should have been
shot out of hand, was later a participant
in a murder conspiracy directed against
his own associates. Seven of these, in-
cluding U Aung San, to whom Britain en-
trusted the reins of the first provisional
Government which developed the transi-
tion to “freedom,” were murdered in cold
blood in their own council-room within
a few months of taking office. U Saw
was hanged by his own compatriots last
May after a futile appeal to the Supreme
Court. Another Premier who succeeded
Aung San, one Thakin Nu, who at first
vigorously denied Communist affilia-
tions, was heard as recently as June 15,
at a time when Government forces
were waging a losing war against Com-
munist “rebels,” praising the Soviet
Union as a model for Burma and urging
that it should follow the Russian system.
He has now announced that he will retire
to a monastery to translate Karl Marx.
The whole country is chaos, as Mr.
Churchill foretold last November. The
so-called Parliament can only meet be-
hind barbed-wire and a cordon of armed
troops, while Communist bands range
the country and no European life is safe.
Burma, in a cenfral position, is probably
more coveted by the Communists than
any other country in southern Asia.
From it there is immediate air access to
Russia, and land and air access to India,
on the one side, to Malaya and southern
China on the other. Yet, having sacri-
ficed tens of thousands of British, Indian,
American and Australian lives to rescue
it from the Japanese, against whom no
Burmese could have raised a finger, the
Attlee Government gave it into hands in
which it is in every moment in danger
of being passed over to the machinations
of the agents of Moscow.
It is hard to find words to condemn the
Attlee course of action. It is just as hard
to express in the right terms an adequate
denunciation of the policy of the Austra-
lian “Government,” which has accepted
the Burman Administrations as blood-
brothers and equals, while showing not
the slightest concern that the joint forces
of the Communist organisations of Asia
and Australia are involved in a con-
spiracy to push the British and Ameri-
cans out of the Indian Ocean and its
adjacent land-masses.
Nobel Can't Save Us.
One of the more persistent phenomena
of Australian politics is the absorption
of Dr. Evatt, Federal Attorney-General
and Minister for External Affairs, with
U.N.O. and what he calls, with just
the right self-deprecatory note, “the Aus-
tralian voice in the peace talks.” If
there was any peace to talk about it might
be worth while ; as it is it seems the
more Dr. Evatt travels to these inter-
national palavers the further we get
away from peace.
Singularly enough, his own Department
of External Affairs has just announced
that “any duly qualified person” may
nominate a candidate for the 1949 Nobel
Peace Prize before next February. There
are sundry “duly qualified” persons
among Dr. Evatt’s admirers, if they feel
like it, and since next year is to be one
of a Royal visitation and a Federal elec-
tion the time would not be inappropriate.
However, as far as Australia is con-
cerned, it mightn’t be a bad time to
examine this peace business, which, in
the first half of this century, seems to
have caused more of the other thing.
After 1918 peace broke out all over the
place. President Wilson turned up at the
1919 Peace Conference full of it and got
a Nobel, prize for his work. A nebulous
mystery compounded of the Nobel theory,
Christianity, pacifism and false sentiment
got hold of people and politicians. There
was a League of Nations, whose pathetic
history doesn’t need retelling. “Dis-
armament” became the thing. Dear old
visionaries like Ramsay MacDonald
arose, disarmed the British and went
about the world full of brotherhood and
the love of man. The U.S.A., though
it retreated into isolation, gave the
“fraternity” notion jnhore or less active
support. “Pacts” of various, kinds were
made, all aimed at Peace. But in Ger-
many, Russia, Italy and Japan other
thoughts were rampant, and presently
World War II was going strong. How
we paid for disarmament in that disaster!
It ended, if it has ended, in a ruined
Europe, the rise of a soulless and horrible
conception of life called Communism,
and an era of mistrust and suspicion.
Now cynicism is abroad. It is a patent
manifestation of the general outlook in
Australia. And everybody nervously
watches international politics, expecting
another great war. In the midst of it
all U.N.O. babbles on, as futile as the
League of Nations in its day, as helpless
as a scrap of paper in a whirlwind. It
can no more enforce peace, which it is
supposed to do, than a mouse could stop
a dogfight.
Peace is a worthy ideal, war is
human disaster, and war has the dread-
ful habit of being worse for the
victor than the vanquished. But peace
can’t be talked into being or brought
about by airy-fairy resolutions in U.N.O.
Among individuals the fellow who enjoys
the most peaceful existence is the one
who makes no bones about his readiness
to fight to protect his peace. That applies
to nations, especially to nations living tar
from their friends and far too close to
potential enemies, as Australia lives. To
suppose for an instant that the collection
which comprises U.N.O. could somehow
save us from an armed and marching
Asia is ridiculous. And to suppose that
a powerful friend will come to our aid
again is to put altogether too much fait
in the future.
What we need is some faith in our-
selves. Putting faith in U.N.O. is a let-
out for a Government willing to shirk
its responsibilities in the matter °f defence
and comforting itself with the doubtiu
solace that if anything does happen
America will rush to our help again. 1
best guarantee of peace and the sures
way of attracting potential allies is w
be armed and ready to defend oursefies.
In his peregrinations about the^
Dr. Evatt, unless he is blind and deat to
everything, ought to be scared stilt .
his country’s unpreparedness. Ine row
he dabbles with U.N.O. and this so-called
peace, the more convinced he should ue
that the ideals of Nobel, worthy though
they be in the abstract, can be a posim
menace in practice. We can subsen ,
the Nobel ideal, but we’ve got to be reao,.
for the fellow who doesn’t.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Redistribution.
Ground-plans for the inflated House of
Representatives are out, and some mem-
rs *k e party that is thrusting upon
the people, unsought, a bigger Parlia-
ment are talking of passing them back to
the architects. Their inability to do any-
thing more drastic is due to a provision
of Commonwealth law which makes dis-
tnbution a matter for the Electoral
Office instead of a plaything of party
politics as in some of the States. Electors
have 30 days in which, to lodge protests
or suggestions. Parliament may accept
or reject the proposals, but cannot alter
them.
The aggrieved tone of some of
the complainants suggests that they
suspect a deep-dyed plot to put
“Labor” out of office. Out of
office “Labor” will doubtless go when
the electors get their chance to speak, but
will be as a result of the party’s own
larrikinism and ineptitude, not through
any action of the Distribution Commis-
sioners, who seem to have done a diffi-
cult and thankless job reasonably well.
The terms of their assignment leave little
room for gerrymandering; in making
their realignments they must observe
a numerical quota with definite
margins above and below and take
into consideration the community of in-
terests of persons within an electorate.
There have been no complaints on the
score of numbers ; most of the groans
are on the community -of - interests
factor.
When Caucus approved the Bigger-if-
not-Better Parliament plan it apparently
expected redistribution to favor “Labor” ;
but some of the party now fear the move
has reacted against them. Those who
feel most strongly on the matter are
naturally those who realise they have
lost their seats in the game of electoral
musical chairs. There have been few
protests from the smaller States, where
the new boundaries do not seem likely
to mean much alteration in the relative
party strengths. The loudest howls have
come from New South Wales and Vic-
toria, or, more specifically, from Sydney
and Melbourne, those two overgrown
wens whose influence at Canberra,
already too great, is further increased.
Subject to the constitutionality of the
whole plan—the appointment of addi-
tional senators may require referendum
approval—the two cities will now send
43 Representatives to a House of 122 ; the
two States 80.
Some disgruntled “Labor” members,
seeing their old seats in jeopardy and un-
certain of their ability to gain preselec-
tion for one of the new ones, seem to
regard “community of interests” in the
matter of boundary-lines as a kind of
lariat that can be flung out to lasso a
pocket of “good” electors here or twisted
like a letter S to exclude a batch of
“bad” electors there.
One election will prove nothing, but
over a period it will probably be found
that the old maxim of swings and round-
abouts has been exemplified and that no
party has gained or lost much in the re-
distribution.
Certainly the people have gained noth-
ing—-unless the privilege of paying the
salaries and expenses of four dozen extra
members can be counted gain. And on
top of that will be the 24 extra senators,
giving the Upper House 10 from each
State, including Tasmania, whose Lower
House representation is only five. Re-
distribution is needed in this country, all
right, but it is redistribution of electors,
not of electorates ; increase is needed,
too, but of population and new States,
not of members of a too-centralised Par-
liament.
"Labor” Sights a Recession.
That expert director of “Labor” elec-
tioneering in Victoria, P. J. Kennelly,
M.L.C. —the man whom Cain called
back urgently from a Canadian visit
when the Victorian State elections broke
early last summer —has thrown Chifley’s
“Golden Age” overboard and forecast a
depression to coincide with the next
Federal elections.
. He does not seem to be in the least
doubt about it, or downcast, either. Per-
haps he thinks the event may save
Chifley from electoral disaster. He gave
out the news in his speech last week in
the Victorian Legislative Council on the
State Savings Bank Bill, which seeks to
facilitate the purchase of houses through
more liberal advances. This, Kennelly
thinks, ought to be prevented because;
We will get a recession in six to 12
months, but I am not going much further.
Within eight months we will be in one,
and a good one... .It might not be as bad
as that of 1931-33, but everyone knows
the U.S. wheat position, and the wheat
position in Australia is not so good as
many people think.
This argument had no effect on the
passage of the bill, and no voice joined
Kennelly’s in crying woe against the
“little capeetalists” of Dedman’s erst-
while contempt. But it will be interest-
ing to see if “Labor” takes up this cry —
whether its Victorian campaign-manager
was prompted from headquarters to open
the ball for Chifley, or whether Chifley
will jump on him with all the righteous
indignation which he would have gener-
ated had (say) Menzies indulged in such
a forecast.
Can Kennelly have been speaking
for the A.L.P. and its Socialist
“politburo” when he represented that
the only result of “social security,”
the 40-hour week, boosted wages,
deliberately reduced man-hour produc-
tion and a programme for nation-
alising everything is “a depression that
might be as bad as that of 1931-33”?
And if, for the reasons given by Ken-
nelly, it is a bad time for Housing Com-
mission tenants to purchase their homes,
why is it a good time for the Common-
wealth Government to launch out into a
Commonwealth Shipping Line?
Is Hanlon Scared, Too?
If there’s anything in reincarnation that
wondrous animal of our youth, the
Pushmi-pullyu, which could face both
ways at once, is back on Queensland
earth as Edward M. Hanlon, Premier of
the State. A week or so ago he was shap-
ing up to ferocious Communist demands
to let Communist lawbreakers out of
prison ; last week he was letting them
SYMPATHY.
“When Southerners pelt Mr. Henry Wallace with eggs and tomatoes they give comfort
to the enemies of freedom, who are eager to find flaws i n our democracy.”
—New York “Herald-Tribune
“I expressed similar sentiments at Warwick nearly thirty years ago, Henry."
out and remitting fines imposed on others
who had broken his own law.
During the April strike, and profiting
by the example of Premier Hollway of
Victoria, who smashed a transport hold-
up by introducing legislation imposing
severe penal clauses on strike-leaders (and
has had comparative quiet in his State
ever since). Premier Hanlon introduced
an Anti-Picketing Act. It was broken by
sundry Communist leaders and dupes.
Haled to court, the offenders were fined
varying amounts. They refused to pay.
Mr. Hanlon’s police threw three ring-
leaders and two lesser lights into jail, A
mysterious hand dropped the amount of
the ringleaders’ fines, £350, into a Queens-
land Government office and the trio came
out.
All this was greeted by the Comrades
as a “workers’ victory” or something, but
few people believed other than that Mr.
Hanlon was determined to stop Com-?
munist outrages; and when it was learned
that two lesser Comrades were still in the
jug, and that sundry others were up for
about £lOOO between them in fines and
costs, speculations as to their fate
scarcely envisaged a weakening of the
Hanlon backbone. The men had broken
Queensland law, he had declared, apropos
of Julius, Healy and Englart, and, as
everybody thought, of the rest, and the
law must deal with them. It was no
longer a matter for the Parliament.
But a sea-change struck the bold
Premier the day after the Communist-Tun
Seamen’s Union blustered that it in-
tended to “take action” unless the re-
mainder were released; he announced
that they would be released and their
fines, and fines imposed on several others,
would be “remitted,” the Government
believing that “having established the
supremacy of the law it should be
merciful.” Merciful! To a bunch who
were prepared to see Queenslanders
starved and ruined to serve the interests
of an alien cult with headquarters in
Moscow!
That it was a bit too much, not only
for Mr. Hanlon’s political opponents but
also for his friends, was quickly evident.
Over the roar of Opposition protests rose
the voice of C. G. Fallon, leader of the
powerful A.W.U. and president of the
Queensland A.L.P. The A.W.U. never
has, and never intends to have, any truck
with Communists, and it can make oi
break “Labor” Governments in Queens-
land. “Whitewashing Communist law-
breakers” was how Mr. Fallon put it,
and he hinted at changes either to sup-
plant the Premier or split the party.
Just before the Premier decided to be
“merciful” to those avowed enemies of
the people, Catholic opposition to Com-
munism was joined by the Lambeth
Conference’s denunciation of “Marxian
Communism,” which more or less lines
up the Protestant churches against it. Like
their fellow - Australians elsewhere,
Queenslanders had been led by their
Premier’s earlier words and actions to
believe that he, too, had no illusions about
ruffians of the Communist kidney. Now
they’re wondering. And doesn’t the man
realise that in their press and by every
other means the Communists will hail this
as a “great victory over Hanlon”? May-
be it was.
Loss of the Lufcma.
The loss of the airliner Lutana with all
13 people aboard was, in one way, due
to some bad luck. Whatever the reason
for the pilot’s being in the area, and
whether or not he knew what course he
was on —a question that has raised
startling speculation—it so happened
that he met the only point in the
Liverpool Range high enough to
bring him down. He was at 4500 ft. on a
dark and stormy night, high enough to
cross the range anywhere except at that
spot. Thus blind chance combined with
human error to add another disaster to
Australian civil-aviation records—records
which are singularly free of accidents
and the cleanest in the world in that
regard.
Entirely as a matter of routine, the
Civil Aviation Department will be
asked a number of questions about
its own organisation as one result
of the disaster. With modem location
equipment the position of the plane
should have been determinable immedi-
ately it was known to be “icing up” in
bad weather conditions, and the pilot, if
co-operating, then shepherded along his
course. Little is to be gained, however,
in anticipating the inquiry’s work pro-
vided this aspect of radio-location is fully
investigated.
The inevitable press picnic of sensa-
tionalism accompanied the accident, but
it had no effect on airline business. The
Australian public has become airminded
since the war, and refuses to believe that
air-travel is fraught with more risks than
any other. It isn’t, of course, as the
millions of air-miles flown each year
without trouble testify.
Let Us Be Careful!
Australians in Singapore, according to
the Department of External Affairs, are
pretty concerned about a dreadful mistake
being made here, and they point out that
“it is obvious that many Australians have
no realisation of the importance of the
distinction” between the words Malay
and Malayan.
A Malay is a member of the Malay race
as it exists in the peninsula of Malaya and
certain districts in the Netherlands East
Indies. The Malay language is the language
of these people, and the adjective of
“Malay” refers only to this community, its
language or its way of life. Malayan, on
the other hand, is a word which has come
into use in recent years to describe anything
pertaining to the peninsula of Malaya
(Malayan Federation, Malayan railways, the
Malayan economy, etc.). The word is used
to describe any resident of the peninsula,
including Chinese, Indians and even
Europeans, who regard Malaya as their
home and the object of their loyalty.
This misapprehension must be cor-
rected. To accuse a Chinese Communist,
fresh from the murder of an Australian,
of being a Malay rather than a Muscovite
might well cause an international incident.
Arid the “importance of the distinction”
will be deeply appreciated by the widows
and orphans of white men and Malays
ambushed and shot to death by
“Malayans” for the want of assistance
from their nearest white neighbor and
U.N.O. member.
To the bullet-riddled Dr. Ong Chong-
keng, lured from his surgery on a plea
of assistance for a sick child and callously
shot down without a chance, the “import-
ance of the distinction” won’t matter
much, but if the spirits of the departed
can look down on earth his spirit should
be diverted by the wonderful machinery
of a Commonwealth department which,
in the midst of the blood and terror and
turmoil of the Malay Peninsula, can par-
ticularise the use of the letter “n” in this
fashion.
Still, there are secrets known to this
department unknown to ordinary folk.
Who knows but that Mr. Macmahon
Ball, who lately carried culture and gifts
to those parts, discovered that the real
cause of the trouble is not, after all, the
Communists, but the resentment of
Malays at being called Malayans, and the
fury of Malayans at being called
Malays?
An Australian Car.
After a considerable delay an Austra-
lian-made car is about to take the roads.
Built by the General Motors-Holden’s
people, it is a medium-sized 21-h.p. six-
cylinder job, capable of carrying six
people comfortably and embodying
modern aspects of automobile design. It
comes out in the 40th year of the
G.M.-H. enterprise, one of the biggest in
Australia, which sprang from an Adelaide
firm of carriage-trimmers and harness-
makers, developed motor-body-building,
and is now, expanded by its U.S. affilia-
tion, one of the biggest employers in
Australia. The car will be called the
Holden.
The vehicle was originally to sell for
about £450, but the 40-hour week and
other costs have bumped its price to about
£6OO. It appears at a time when a com-
bination of overseas troubles and local
coal anarchy has resulted in cuts in petrol
rations ; all the same, it marks something
that many Australians have looked for-
ward to for years—mass-production of
an Australian-built car. This country is
one of the world’s best markets for motor
vehicles. If the Holden stimulates its
overseas competitors into establishing
factories here (subject to the market
available), all the better. Meantime
its advent is important, and its p'roduction
a healthy sign amidst the political and
industrial distempers of the times. Good
luck to the Holden!
The Real Mackay.
“Orion” wants credit given where it is
due: —.
Calwell’s A.B.C. news service has been
starring that plumage-changing bird R. W. G.
Mackay as the bright boy who is leading the
planning of a United States of Europe at the
international meeting at Interlaken, Switzer-
land.
“Kim” Mackay, as he used to be known in
Sydney before he migrated to fresh political
fields in England, tried various brands of politi-
cal faith there before he got himself a Labor
seat at the last general elections in Britain. His
politics have been a volatile element, directed
to one end. He belongs, undoubtedly, to the
Evatt school.
But this A.B.C. boosting of him as the star
of European union is a bit too hot. The move-
ment for a United States of Europe has a his-
tory of some 25 years in our time, and, as The
Bulletin pointed out more than a year
ago, the man who deserves the credit for advo-
cating it in season and out during the old League
of Nations’ wrangles is Count Coudenhove-
Kalergi. In 1923 he published in Vienna his
book Pan-Europa, reviving much earlier projects
in a modernised argument for consolidation of
democracy on the Continent.
In that book he warned the West, with re-
markable prescience:
History gives Europe the following
alternative: either to overcome all national
hostilities and consolidate in a federal
union or, sooner or later, to succumb to
a Russian conquest.
That is, in effect, precisely the warning delivered
by General Marshall last year when he broached
his plan for American aid of a Europe pre-
pared to help itself “through a political and
economic agreement.”
Count Coudenhove-Kalergi’s efforts between
the two world wars inspired the meeting of
four or five pan-European conferences at various
centres, most of them quite as well attended as
the present one at Interlaken. He won over
Aristide Briand, of France, and Paul Van Zee-
land, the Belgian statesman and economist, and
by 1938 there had developed definite practical
plans to which the present U.N.O. financial
and trade agreements owe much. When
Hitler annexed Austria in 1938 the Count fled
to the United States and continued his work
there. He was invited to the Paris Peace Con-
ference in 1946 as an observer. Mr. Churchill

became a convert to the European Union plan
in that year, and publicly proclaimed the Count
as its principal sponsor and the Count’s work
as his own inspiration.
Mr. Churchill has since been an ardent advo-
cate in the cause, and after the May meetings at
The Hague corresponded in a series of letters
(published in the “Times”) with the British
Prime Minister, urging that the British Govern-
ment should throw its support wholeheartedly
into helping to create a Western Union. Mr.
Attlee has so far hedged, desiring to ascertain
Dominion reactions.
That is one of the subjects the Empire Prime
Ministers are to discuss next month in Lon-
don. Some form of Western Union seems to
.be coming, for precisely the reason Count
Coudenhove-Kalergi gave in 1923 and General
Mackay the wizard of the piece, as those
Marshall endorsed in 1947. But “Kim
other flash lads of the A.B.C. would have it?
blonsense!
POLITICAL POINTS
It had been assumed by the Press—
and Bert did nothing to correct the as-
sumption—that Our Foreign Policy
would plead the Government case
in the Bank-Grab appeal to the Privy
Council. Last week someone discovered
that as a member of {he judicial com-
mittee of the Council he would be in-
eligible to appear before it. A.B.C. was
quick to point out that Dr. Evatt would
not be appearing in the case owing to
the urgency of other duties.
Stock line of the Stadium wrestling-
broadcaster —“He can’t get out of it. He
can’t get out of it. He’s out of it!”—
was recalled by the finale of the A.L.P.-
Clive - Evatt - Australian - Russian-Society
bout. Evatt had vowed the show was not
pro-Communist, and had said he would
resign if it could be shown that Com-
munists were members'. Names of at
least two avowed Comrades were quoted
to him; Clive stayed put. The A.L.P.
executive declared the society a Com-
munist-controlled body, giving Clive (and
others) the choice of resigning from it or
from the A.L.P. Then, just before the
gong, the society “relieved” him of the
presidency, at the same time “relieving”
Federal Minister Ward and R. A. King,
M.L.C., vice-presidents. The move
was made “out of respect and gratitude.”
That’s what the committee said. But
what was the cry from the bleachers?
There’s a dreadful sameness about
these Socialist notions of responsibility.
Mr. Chifley told Parliament in effect that
because most of the 17,000 whites in
Malaya had “gone thete for profit” there
was, apparently, no need to become ex-
cited if a few of them were murdered by
Communist terrorists. Next day it came
out, through A. W. Wallich, of the
Malayan Federal Legislative Council,
that when British residents there, tried to
warn the Socialist Government in Britain
of the impending violence, they were dis-
missed as “a small clique of capitalists,”
Is it the Attlee-Chifley conception that
anybody who tries to make a living in-
dependent of Socialism, and thereby
spread British prestige and interests, de-
serves to be shot up?
Publication of suggested redistribution
plan for N.S.W. Federal electorates
brought shrill squeals from Haylen, of
Parkes, and Daly, of Martin. It appears
that someone has pinched their majorities,
though in the case of Haylen the majority
must have been hard to find. Daly told
‘S. M. Herald”: “I have lost the Labor
core of my electorate in the Gladesville
area” ; and Haylen confided to the “Tele-
graph”: “The addition of Haberfield to
Parkes will make this seat a difficult pro-
position for Labor.” Haberfield came out
of Daly’s electorate, but “Dollars” isn’t
complaining about that.
National Quiz-time coming round again,
it fell to Lang to ask Chifley the
1,189,110-dollar question. It concerns
cement —Metropolitan Portland Cement,
Ltd., to be exact. Chifley got the gong
from interested radio-listeners for his
answer. He’ll be asked more about it yet.
The Commo-bossed 8.W.1.U., having,
in the words of Judge Foster, not by
any means an enemy of Labor, “with-
drawn men from their employment, im-
posed black bans on jobs, made threats
to employers and employees and publicly
announced its determination to achieve
its end by force of its economic power,”
was deregistered by the Full Arbitration
Court. It all started when the Corns
tried to browbeat a Digger unionist who
wouldn’t be browbeaten, but stuck to his
job and defied them. The 8.W.1.U.
secretary says the union “is not worried
by the decision.” He means the Com-
munist bosses; decent unionists weren’t
at all happy about it, and, getting their
chance, 4000 of them at a meeting re-
jected a Commo motion to continue
“direct action” and ordered the executive
to seek re-registration.
Delegates to the national convention of
the Miners’ Federation last week
urged that opencuts “should not be de-
veloped in a way calculated to threaten
the underground industry,” and that
“when supply met demand no further
opencut development should take place
and that opencut mines should cut down
operations pursuant to surplus coal re-
quirements.” So the function of a coal-
mine is to provide jobs for miners. That
the whole of Australian industry depends
on coal and that cheaper coal means, in
the long run, more-jobs for Australian
workers doesn’t matter.
Falstein found time, during the hear-
ing of the case in which he is charged,
with two others, with presenting false in-
voices to the Customs Department in
connection with imported watches, to
announce his intention of standing for
the new Federal seat of Kingsford,
carved out of the Maroubra end of his
present electorate, Watson. It appears he
doesn’t like the name, though, and would
prefer Watson, which has been retained
for the Coogee-Randwick area, unsafe
for Maxie, He will “endeavor to have
the names switched.”
Chifley, Baddeley and “Fixer” Ashley
went to the N.SW. coal towns on Sun-
day with a mixture of kidstakes, chiding
and promises and the usual attack on the
press, which, until it could stomach it no
longer, has been mighty friendly to
Chifley’s Government. All three dodged
the word “Communist” ; Chifley spoke of
“people whose business is supposed to be
to bring chaos to industry,” and Baddeley
of “some mysterious organisation—the
mine-owners or somebody else.” Chifley’s
and Baddeley’s “business” is to protect
the community against this “mysterious
organisation,” not be mealy-mouthed
about it.
Advocates of Proportional Representa-
tion speak up! In France, where the
system is applied to a Chamber of
Deputies running into hundreds of
members, it results in a multiplicity of
parties whose interests can never be
reconciled long enough to keep a Govern-
ment in office more than a few weeks;
in Tasmania, with a small House of
Assembly, it results in a deadlock. At
the week-end in Paris Schuman formed a
Government which no one expects to
last; in Hobart Cosgrove in his hunt for
a Speaker was talking of appointing one
from outside Parliament.
Postscript to the Goodwill Mission to
Malaya from the July number of
“British Malaya”:
Macmahon Ball faced the strong politi-
cal wind....and urged that the broader
problems of neighborliness should not be
forgotten in the concentration on recent
misunderstandings. He won respect from
everyone he met, and, if unexpected ad-
versity is the real test of character, he
passed that test with ease and, through
himself, won respect for his country. That
cannot be said of the Australian Ministers,
whose comments on Macmahon Ball s state-
ments dissipated for Singapore much of the
good his mission had done.
The system under which nobody could
buy a car without Ward’s official permis-
sion was due to end last week for cars of
12 h.p. and under. Few people believed
in this voluntary resignation of official
interference by the Federal Commissar
for Transport; and, sure enough, Ward
announced on the eve of the appointed
day that, while permits were finished, a
purchaser would still have to get the de-
partment’s approval. The Moscow touch.
Some more “Labor” purging seems in-
dicated. Recently an S.A. “Labor”
Assemblyman and an ex-vice-president
of the Victorian A.L.P. objected to being
pushed around by “the movement” and
were outed. When Beckett, a “Labor”
member of the Victorian Legislative
Council, commenting the other day on
the cost of price-subsidies, said that the
Federal Government was not only ex-
acting unnecessary taxation but was
keeping “a horde of barnacles growing
on the public service,” Calwell at once
flared up with a retort that Beckett was
unfit to remain within the “Labor” party.
Among men of free minds that remark
is fast becoming a compliment.
While Darwin wharfies were on strike
someone hauled down the Australian flag
on the steamer Barrigun and painted a
hammer and sickle on it. Her skipper,
Captain Robert Duncan, lined up his
crew and offered to fight the man re-
sponsible, but, Reds being a cowardly
breed, there were no takers.* He pointed
out that the ship was built in Australia
and was flying the Australian flag under
conditions equal to any in the world.
Barrigun is one of the vessels mentioned
by Ashley, Minister for Shipping, in a
letter he wrote to the “ship’s committee”
of another coastal vessel disclosing the
intention of the Government to establish
a Commonwealth Shipping Line —infor-
mation he had not seen fit to convey to
Parliament or the people, but confirmed
by McKell at the Canberra opening.
Chased into a corner by a hint that one
of his leading supporters might desert
him if he allowed Communists to run his
party, Henry Horsecollar Wallace came
out with:
If there are any Communists that do be-
lieve in the violent overthrow of the U.S.
Government, I do not want their support.
If any group puts allegiance to some foreign
capital first —whether Moscow or any other
place—l would not want their support.
“If, if” It might almost be Chifley
speaking.
Strange how “Labor” politicians keep
on sighting a depression just round the
corner. Latest is Kennelly, M.L.C. and
general secretary of the A.L.P. Talk-
ing on a bill to increase Savings Bank
advances to home-builders, he said there’d
be a “recession within eight months” and
he didn’t want “the youth of today to
suffer the anguish and worry of the
youth of 1927 and 1928. The depression
might be as bad as that of 1931.” Oh,
come, Kennelly, won’t Chifley still be
implementing the Golden Age eight
months hence?
The latest Chifley cuts in income tax
are consistently referred to as “conces-
sions” to the taxpayers. The right word
is “restitutions.”
Opposition generalship at Canberra is
not of the sort that wins battles. In the
Address-in-reply debate Chifley, having
admitted that Communism was merely
Nazism in another guise, was arguing that
unrest in Europe, Malaya, India and
Palestine was not Communism, though
the Communists everywhere “hastened to
pour oil on the fires.” Then he came to
Australia, and was apparently about to
dilate on the discontent here when his
time ran out. And Harrison had not the
gumption to move an extension of time
so that Chifley could tell Australia just
how, in the light of his previous argu-
ment, he now viewed the local Com-
munist “philosophy.”
When Hitler’s pet economic expert,
Gottfried Feder, described Dr. Hjalmar
Horace Greeley Schacht as an eel Schacht
came back with “Yes, an eel among
herring.” After a lifetime spent among
all kinds of queer fish the old eel has
slipped through the net once more. The
Allied War Crimes Tribunal acquitted
him in 1946, but a few months later the
Denazification Court sent him to jail for
eight years—at 70, virtually a life sen-
tence. He has just won his appeal and
is now at liberty.
Moscow radio, announces that hence-
forth every Russian man and woman has
the right to build or buy a home “as
private property.” It is not likely that
the announcement will bring the average
Russki any nearer to getting a home than
McGirr’s election promise to build 90,000
homes in three years did N.S.W.’S home-
less, but it will send a shudder down the
spine of Socialist Minister Dedman, who
abhors “little capeetalists.”
Add to the list of Britain’s bemedalled
Ms.P, William Gallacher. No, it’s not
a British Empire Medal —nothing so
cheap as that. It’s Order of the Slovak
Rising First-class for William, pinned on
his breast by Comrade Gottwald in
Prague while Benes wa£ breathing his
last.
In June 1600 more employees were
added to Government and local-govern-
ment payrolls, bringing the total to
nearly 600,000 —about one-third of the
number in private employment. At this
rate next time Hartley Grattan comes
here he’ll be able to write a book on a
land where everybody works for the Gov-
ernment.
Word comes from Canberra that
Federal Cabinet has decided “to permit”
Australian aborigines to vote in those
States where they already have a State
vote. Why this discrimination? White
citizens are compelled to vote ; penalty
for omission to do so, £2.
Miners’ Federation convention objected
to the employment of Poles at Glen Davis
on the ground that they “have an outlook
and training foreign to the democratic
ideals of the Australian working-class
movement.” Calwell, denying the charge,
pointed out that many of the newcomers
had belonged to the Polish Social Demo-
cratic party; some had worked in mines
in Britain and had been admitted to the
British Miners’ Union. He was taking the
resolution too literally. What the Federa-
tion really meant was that the Poles
understand work to mean work.
The five Russian doctors who were
given the privilege of certifying that
Zhdanov died from natural causes must
not be confused with the similar number
of medicos who have received an order
from non-Communist Clive Evatt to join
the McKenna free-cough-mixture scheme
or get out of his Housing Commission
settlements.
Chifley told an assembly of miners and
others at Kurri Kurd that he didn’t speak
to them as Prime Minister but “as one
citizen to another and one trade-unionist
to another.” Is the man ashamed of his
high office?
The other night in Sydney’s Rose Bay
two men and two women were attacked
by thugs. Whereupon Rose Bay Diggers
alleged that the thugs had been
hired by one Lars Brundahl, a former
German internee, who was further
alleged to have spat at one of the attacked
women on a previous occasion and said,
“I have paid thugs to get rid of people I
loathe.” The R.S.L. had already de-
manded Brundahl’s! deportation, and has
now asked the Prime Minister for an
investigation into his doings. It has also
urged the Government to withdraw
from the “National Loan Quiz” a former
Nazi named Von Skerst. Police inter-
viewed Brundahl after the bashing, but
took no action.

“Police officers, camouflaged in bathing costumes,

With infinite acumen and resource
For coppers what are called “plain-clothes” dis-

To catch delinquents off their guard, of course.
And very few, one readily surmises,

Among our summer beach-frequenters, dressed
In just as much (or little) as the rest.

And lark on shores where crested billows

Plunge in the tide or amiably scramble
For pleasant places in the sun to bake,

Hither and yon one who (make no mistake)
Is stationed there officially to stop
All that’s unseemly, viz., a plain-clothes cop.
With nothing to identify his calling
The patient peeler will be there, alert
For conduct that the Law regards as galling
Or apt to deal morality a hurt.

Of any miscreant, it’s safe to assert,

But this, it’s surely obvious to the full,
Is what will give the beachside sleuths their
pull.
And, in addition to their grimmer duties
Around the rippling surf and on the sands,
They’ll doubtless be requiring bathing beauties
To wear the minimum the law demands.
So watch your straps, you sparsely swim-clad
cuties,
Lest by mischance you fall into the hands
Of those who watch the concourse, near and far,
And look like anything but—what they are.

“Torch”: I was jammed in the crush
at the rear of the tram. As 1 moved my
head about in a bid for fresh air, a fellow
at the other end caught my eye and
smiled. I didn’t know him but I grinned
back. Then he started to claw his way
a l -mg the aisle. I followed his rough
passage with interest. So did everyone
else on the tram. When he arrived with
clothing awry, he thrust out a huge hand
and said beerily: “Old Jack! Haven’t
seen ya for years.” I took the proffered
fist and said sheepishly: “Sorry, mate,
but my name’s Bill.” He took a closer
look, cursed, then mouthed bitterly:
“Well, fancy going through all that for i
ruddy stranger! A man oughter sock
ya! ”

“Melbn”: The alleged Japanese garden

to book-scholarship for as long as any-
body can remember is no more. It has
been demolished by the City Council to
make way for a Hollywood Bowl in
which evening and Sunday-afternoon con-
certs can be given. On one occasion
officers from a visiting Jap warship were
taken there. “Garden,” said the official
guide, waiting for the expected outburst
of nostalgic delight from his guests.
“Yes,” said the Nips blankly. “Japanese
garden! ” said the guide. “No! ” said
the Nips with decision. It is proposed to
accommodate an orchestral stand on the
island formerly occupied by the garden,
a bridge will be thrown across the “lake”
for the musicians, and the rising sweep
of the lawn will provide seating accom-
modation for 100,000 people. On the
north side terraces of flowers will stretch
back to the embankment.

“G.E.P.”: My personal war horror
was my semi-waking vision in a Haifa
pub bedroom. Actually the Wog gentle-
man with the easel was not so much out
of keeping with Winston Churchill,
General Blarney, the barmaid from’ the
Shearers’ Arms in Mulgaville and sundry
other characters who seemed to have
made inroads on my privacy. However,
these had the decency to withdraw before
I opened my eyes for the second time.
The Wog with the easel remained. “Shall
I start now, Saire?” he asked. “Yes!
Start going straightway,” I replied with
all the venom I could inject in my voice.
“Out the door!” “But! Saire! You
commissioned me to paint your portrait
at ten o’clock this morning,” rejoined my
persecutor. Weakly I subsided, and I
now have a portrait of my own death-
mask, which is an effective deterrent to
this day whenever I feel tempted to
jump off the water-wagon.

“Mac Fergus”; “From pub door to
parish church” is the history of the door-
knocker which originally decorated the
Bull’s Head Inn at Drayton on the Darl-
ing Downs and now serves St. Matthew’s,
where the centenary of the first Anglican
service on the Downs —conducted by
Archdeacon Glennie at the Bull’s Head
on August 20, 1848 —was celebrated last
month. The Bull’s Head, now the Dray-
ton Post Office, was the subject of Bul-
letin verses by David Rowbotham a few
months ago.

“Wanchai”; Even in these slipshod
days politicians should be careful in their
choice of words. Emanuel Shinwell,
Attlee’s Secretary for War, recently
boasted that he was proud to be a
member of a Government which had
achieved a “magnificent trilogy of
socialisation” —the Nationalisation of
Coal Mines, the Bank of England and
Inland Transport. Unfortunately for
Shinwell, there are still in England purists
who rise in wrath at any threat to the
sanctity of a word. One of them wrote
to the “Times,” and pointed out that
“trilogy” is of Greek derivation and that
the strict meaning is “three tragedies, all
associated, but each complete in itself.”
Attention of Australian Socialists had
already been drawn to the word in similar
circumstances.

“Bo”: Hailed as a scientific genius
even greater than the scientist-comrade
who stunned the world during the war by
inventing false-teeth for Soviet cows—
the bovine denture industry this year bids
fair to oust party-purging and coffin-
making as the U.S.S.R.’s biggest employer
—is Akhmet Korgazbayev, a livestock
breeder who, by crossing Merino ewes
with mountain goats (no, mountain rams)
has developed a “new type of, wool
better than pure Merino,” according to
Moscow Radio. The new breed has
“long sturdy legs and hard hooves and
is very agile.” No doubt the new wonder-
sheep will have been bred also to moult
their wool in the early spring, thus allow-
ing workers from the collectivised shear-
ing industry to be absorbed in the more
important ones of making gyves, balls-
and-chains and barbed-wire. The evolu-
tion of hard hooves for Merinos is a
great advance —the soft, jelly-like hooves
of Australian Merinos have long held
back our own sheep industry through the
necessity of having to wheel the sheep
around in barrows everywhere they go.
The long, sturdy legs of the new Soviet
Merinos have been bred to enable them
to step over fast-flowing rivers, railway
viaducts and telegraph-poles. Australia
perhaps can expect a huge export market
shortly in kangaroos, which will be the
only animals capable of mustering these
agile wizards of wool.

“Shen”: Last lap of Vendetta’s tow.
The Islander (B. 25 /8 / ’4B) picked up the
destroyer at Albany after she was dropped
by Ping Wo, herself disabled. The three
ships left Albany together, Islander tow-
ing Vendetta and with instructions to keep
a weather eye on Ping Wo, but during a
storm in the Bight we lost sight of her.
We had our own troubles; tow-ropes
parted several times and we almost lost
Vendetta. Meanwhile; we flashed mes-
sages asking all ships to keep a look-out
for Ping Wo. A couple of days before
we reached Adelaide we sighted survey
ship Moresby and tug Woonda hunting
for us. We made Adelaide on April 7,
1942, repaired damage and left, with
Vendetta once again in tow, three days
later, reaching Port Melbourne on April
15. There, to our surprise, was Ping Wo,
safe and sound.

“Ike Hollar”: The bus tore past wait-

deign to stop, started again so suddenly
that those who had managed to scramble
aboard were nearly jolted off. The New

to remark. “This bus in a hurry is—yes?
Perhaps it is not this bus ; perhaps this
bus is the bus that was timed to leave

“Plop”: While browsing among the
derelict bath-heaters and kerosene-lamps
at the back of a second-hand shop, I
heard a woman’s voice coming from out-
side where the store’s packed assortment
overflowed through the door on to the
pavement. The salesman was with her
in a flash, and she explained that she had
poked her fingers through the wires of an
empty parrot-cage and that they were
stuck. The salesman asked her to pull
hard, but she had already done that. He
decided that the lady’s rings were pre-
venting the withdrawal, so he undid the
cage door, reached in and removed them.
This merely transferred the job of jailers
to the lady’s knuckles. She was beginning
to moan that it was nearly four o’clock
and she would soon have to get the dinner
on, when the salesman brought hp the
reprieve in the form of a pair of pliers.
The wires separated, she removed the
hand, flexed her fingers to see if they had
stiffened, and put on her rings. Did
madam want to buy this cage—3os., a
bargain, with a genuine pine resting-
bar? “Oh, no” —she was just looking
round.

“W.H.0.”: One group of people in
Melbourne lacks all desire to see the

needed even to glimpse the trophy, and
it caused bank officials no end of worry.

“Dong”: A student of British Parlia-
mentary form, as published in the
“Times,” tells me that the way for a
novice to enjoy the reports is to skip
through them until he comes to
“laughter” and pause there to see what
caused it. Trying his system I found that
the first recorded mirth in a recent debate
followed words by Viscount Mersey, who
was speaking on proposed tests for British
Civil Service candidates. He mentioned
a certain undergraduate whose case al-
ways came into his mind when examina-
tions were up for discussion. Though a
poor scholar the lad was a fine oarsman,
so amoral test was planned to see if the
college could possibly retain his services.
He needed 50 per cent, to pass, and to
the first question “Who wrote the
Aineid?” he answered “Homer,” which
was wrong. The examiner came up with
his second query: “Do you know any-
thing that Homer did write?” The pupil
answered “No,” which was right. He
passed.

“Cauboy”; I wonder on which side
the people who have been solemnly
listening to Rossini’s “Barber of Seville”
at His Majesty’s, Melbourne, would have
been if they had been in Rome in 1816
when the first production was given with
the composer himself at the piano. Nine-
tenths of the house was composed of
partisans of the aged Paisiello, who had
written an opera on the same theme, and
they whistled throughout the show.
Rossini shrugged his shoulders and went
home, and when some of his supporters
hurried to his lodgings to commiserate
with him they found him sleeping
soundly. A few nights later the whistlers
were chairing him home to his apart-
ments by the light of a thousand torches.

“J.P.” on our first iron-ore mine:
A century ago the N.S.W. Government
Gazette announced the impending sale on
September 13 of certain lands at Mittagong,
and subsequently J. T. Neale, Thomas Holmes,
T. T. Smith and W. T. Smith took up this
land and, towards the end of the year, com-
menced the first smelting of iron in Australia.
Actual date of starting operations is not known,
but the “S. M. Herald” of 12/12/1848 spoke
of “Mr. Neale’s iron-mine at the Ironstone
Bridge,” and on 30/1/1849 recorded that Gov-
ernor Fitz Roy and party had examined the
mine, then known as the Fitz Roy Iron Mine.
That name, with variations in spelling, has been
used down the years. The Governor’s visit was
marked by the proprietors presenting to him
“an elegant knife, containing 12 different in-
struments, of colonial workmanship (mounted
with colonial gold), the steel of which was
smelted from the ore” from the mine. From
1848 until about 1896, when work ceased for
many years—Australian Iron and Steel, Ltd.,
quarried 14,100 tons of ore from the mine ih
1941 several companies unsuccessfully
attempted to operate the mine profitably. One
writer, dealing with its history in a Bowral
paper in 1887, commented; “The Fitzroy Iron
Mines, Mittagong! A huge, dismal monument
of ruined hopes, irretrievable loss, reckless ex-
penditure, mismanagement and. incompetence,
and went on to doubt whether previous failures
of gold and copper flotations had so “insidi-
ously and systematically burnt speculators
fingers as had Mittagong iron-mines, despite
their innocent geological aspect and the ex-
istence of virgin iron in large quantities pro-
truding above the ground in rugged seductive-
ness.” One of the main difficulties was the in-
tractable nature of the ore, despite its admit-
tedly good quality. Amongst men who in-
spected the ore, said to have been located by
Surveyor Jacques whilst arranging a deviation
in the Southern Road in 1833, or who were
associated with one or other of the companies
controlling the mine, were many experts, some
from England, such as Rev. W. B. Clarke,
B. W. Lattin, Hughes Bros., Thomas Levick
David Smith, T. Chalker, Hampshire and W.
Sandford. One company formed in England,
with the Earl of Devon as chairman, had a
capital of about £60,000, and bore the imposing
title of the “Fitzroy Bessemer Steel and Hema-
tite Iron and Coal Company,” despite which,
or perhaps because of which, it went the way
of the others. Iron from the mine was use
to fashion the spade with which Govern
Fitz Roy’s daughter turned the first sod or tn
Sydney-Parramatta railway on July -h :
Articles made from the ore were also exhibit
at the Paris International Exhibition in is- >
and about 1866 a number of cylinders were cas
for incorporation in the Gundagai bridge.
October 2, during the centenary celebrations oi
Mittagong, a commemorative cairn or B
trachyte and iron-ore will be unveiled o
site of the mine by the Governor, L -
General Northcott. The Royal Australian
Historical Society has arranged for era
the cairn, cost of which is being borne ,

RELIEVED.
‘•The Australian-Russian Society, to save Clive
Evatt and Eddie Ward from the embarrassing choice
of definitely cutting loose from it or being expelled
from the Labor party, has decided to ‘relieve’ them
of- their important positions in the organisation,
while warmly thanking them for their services.”
It’s safe to assume that they pondered a lot
In their well-meant attempts to contrive
A method of cutting the Gordian knot
Presented to Eddie and Clive.
But they got it at last. The distinction is fine,
But these two Ministerial nobs
Won’t now be compelled under threats to resign
From the possies they held in the Russophile
line —
They’ve just been “relieved” of their jobs.
Twas a ticklish dilemma, be sure, that they
found
They were in, this redoubtable pair,
Between snouting one body to which they were
bound
Or giving the other the air.
But the Corns and their cobbers in solemn con-
clave,
As doubtless by now you’ll have read,
A means of escape to the puzzled ones gave,.
A courteous gesture invented to save
The faces of Clivie and Ed.
“Better go,” they advised, “but ’twill free you
from blame
Among all who are friends of the Russ
Now you’re free to point out that the severance
came
In no sense from you but from us.
We ‘relieve’ you from office with lively regret
And posts where so much you’ve achieved.”.
A decision at which, far, from feeling upset
Or even disgruntled, I’ll venture a bet,
Both Eddie and Clive arc “relieved.”

“Caley”: Cruiser Hobart could easily
have been sunk through one man’s stout-
ness. When she was operating in Sunda
Strait air attacks were frequent,, and all
main hatches of the ship were closed,
leaving only admission hatches open be-
tween decks. These were circular open-
ings just big enough to allow an ordinary-
sized man to squeeze through. One day
alarm-gongs clanged with an urgent shrill.
A.A. gun-crews rushed to get to the
upper-deck; fire-parties rushed to get
between decks. One fat bloke got firmly
wedged in an admission hatch and was
unable to free himself. Enemy aircraft
were overheard ; members of gun-crews
were trapped below. It was not until a
few seconds before the first bombs fell
that he was freed by parties of men strain-
ing, shoving and hauling. Next day an
order was issued that all men were to
muster for physical training olice a day.

Hobart is to lose one of its
chief tourist attractions—the double-
decker tram is to be so whittled down
that all its charm will be gone. A few
weeks ago a double-decker capsized, the
third to do so in three years, so the City
Fathers have ordered the removal of
seats and roof from the upper-deck.
Tourists like riding on the open top of the
tram, which has a violent plunging
motion, partly due to the fact that the
wheels are bunched under its middle. In
summer a ride on top is a pleasantly ex-
citing adventure, but only the hardiest
natives negotiate the steep winding stairs
in winter.

“Macnell”: In November, 1943, the
new U.S. battleship Iowa was heading for
Oran, with a valuable cargo of high-
ranking officials, Tehran-bound —Presi-
dent Roosevelt, Admiral King, General
Marshall and a hierarchy of staff-officers.
Suddenly out of the sea to starboard there
sprang the white wake of a torpedo.
Iowa’s guffs were firing at three
practice a.-a. balloons, but on a
shouted order from the bridge, “This
is not drill! ” all guns depressed on
the approaching torpedo. Iowa heaved
her vast bulk under full rudder and
slipped the “fish” astern. No anti-sub-
marine action was taken by escorting
destroyers—the torpedo that nearly hit
America’s newest battleship, with the
President watching its approach from his
wheel-chair, was fired by an American
destroyer. The boat’s unfortunate com-
mander revealed at the immediate inquiry
that, rolling in heavy seas, one tube had
spilled its contents. He didn’t know at
the time just who were his targets; if he
had, as Harry Hopkins says, telling the
story in his secret papers, he would prob-
ably have slung his own anchor round his
neck and taken one step outboard from
the guard-rails.

“Col M.”: New York has been cele-
brating its Golden Jubilee —it was not
until 1898 that its five boroughs were
consolidated into New York City, To
open the official doings the ribbon was
to be cut in a manner only Yanks could
think of. It seems that 50 years ago a
beam of light started on its 300,000,000-
milc journey from the star Alioth Or-
“Tell Colonel Throtilehinde if he Wants any more hot-dogs to come and
cook them himself. He's not in Poonah now!"
ganisers of the anniversary celebrations
decided that it would be fitting to use
this particular beam, due to arrive on
the day of celebration, to cut the ribbon.
Their plan was to collar it with a tele-
scope, make it activate a miniature atomic
pile, which in turn would ignite a mag-
nesium strip woven into the official nylon
ribbon. When this parted the Mayor
could, declare the show open with words
about the appropriateness of the atom re-
placing the scissor in this modern age
Considering the fun American papers had
at our expense over the Newcastle com-
memorative stamp with the portrait of
the wrong John Shortland, I was hop-
ing that in New York’s ceremony some
other star than Alioth would do a De
Groot; but no, the ceremony went off
without a hitch—as far as any layman
can tell.

“K.”: The Full High Court has just
resolved a dispute which began over three
years ago when one Queensland gentle-
man, named Kettle, very drunk, while
driving a motor-car carrying another
Q.g. named Joyce, also very drunk,
wrecked the vehicle. The passenger lost
an eye, sued the driver for damages, and
the Queensland Supreme Court awarded
him £7OO. The High Court upheld the
driver’s appeal, the Chief Justice saying,
in effect, that the pot had no right to call
the Kettle solely responsible, being
equally drunk. Where neither party could
claim that, under the effects of alcoholic
stimulation, motor in-co-ordination was
unaccompanied by psychical confusion,
the presumption of contributory negli-
gence, y’r Honor, cannot be ruled out.
Quite so.

“Flip”: Attempting to find why the
cords on subscribers’ phones develop the
twists, the British P.M.G. held an investi-
gation. They found that most men and
90 per cent, of women lift the receiver
with the right hand, transfer it to the left,
and then “set” the twist by replacing the
receiver with the left hand. I did not
become really interested in this port-and-
starboard business until the custodian of
the “Gentlemen’s Smoking Room” at a
city theatre leant on his broom and
bared another slant. “See how the floor-
tiles coming in from the doorway is all
wore,” he said. “I’ve counted. Seven
out of 10 folk coming in here turn to the
right. In winter they all turn to the right.
When they gets in some of them has to
cross the floor anyhow—see that other
worn bit; some day it’s going to cost fifty
quid to get it all re-tiled. We’ve tried
notices with arrows pointing to the left
but it’s no use. If they’re in a hurry they
turn to the right.”

“Curtain Raiser”: “Oxmead’s” ex-
amples of conscious sub-editing of Shak-
speare (B. 1/9/’4B) recall the unconscious
sub-editing of a line of “Hamlet” by a
barnstorming lady in the ’nineties. In-
tending to banish the gloom of her
melancholy offspring with the lines:
“Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color
off,” she intoned: “Good Hamlet, cast
thy colored nightie off.”

“Cauboy”: Thespians who take spoken
parts at short notice (B. l/9/’4B) haven’t
anything like the complex burden which
is thrown upon the understudy when a
grand-opera prima donna is missing at
the rising of the curtain. Jean Campbell,
the Melbourne coloratura, took it on the
other evening when she had to rush on
as Rosina in “The Barber of Seville.”
The 22-year-old damsel, who had never
sung with the orchestra before, not only
came out of the vocal test with distinc-
tion but imparted a refreshing spon-
taneity to the character. Patti, Sembrich,
Tetrazzini and Melba are among the
prima donnas who have been interna-
tionally famous as Rosina. Miss Camp-
bell is a Melbourne “Sun” Aria Winnei,
a fact which was mentioned by the Sun
but, strangely enough, by neither the
“Age” nor the “Argus.”

“X.S.”: The Mallee out beyond Mil-
dura revealed a grimmer secret than the
sly-grog shop reported by “Etiwanda
(B. 1/9/’4B) when a rabbit-trapper came
on a skeleton stretched out in a clearing
half a mile from the river. A log kept
in an old notebook stored in a tobacco-
tin told the whole story. “My sciatica
has got me in the leg and I cannot walk,
was one of the entries. The last was 1
know I am finished so I will say goodbye
to the world.” The loneliness of the
victim’s death was given an extra poig-
nancy by the fact that his name was
Smith, probably the loneliest name in the
English language.
* * * *
“Findy”: Modern salescraft has me
baffled. 1 recall a doss-house in Adelaide's
Hindley-street which used to hang out a
placard “Beds Is. Clean Beds Is. 6d.
That was clear enough, and I could under-
stand it, though I believe many a client
who coughed up the extra sixpence had
occasion, during a night spent in sleep-
less scratching, to remember the old
maxim “Caveat emptor.” But two notices
I saw last week in a Sydney fruitshop
have still got me wondering. Two equal-
sized punnets of strawberries bore the
price-cards: “Choice 35.” and Exti a
Choice 2s. 6d.” I took bananas.
* * * *
“Zake”: As the highly-decorative
young thing opened the train window and
nonchalantly tossed out her half-smoked
cigarette, the fellow sitting opposite her,
who had on several occasions opened his
tobacco-tin and gloomily surveyed its
meagre contents, gave a shudder. After
a few minutes of browsing through her
magazine the y.t. ripped open a full
packet and lit up, and it was a study in
tragicomedy to watch the expression on
the face of the tortured one as he went
through all the motions of the drawback
in unison with her. He ran his tongue
over his lips and a painful spasm shook
him as that cig., with an inch and a half
still unsmoked,- went the way of the
other. As she took another out and
tapped it on her carmined nail he turned
a few shades paler, and when that fag,
too, was flicked out the window half-
smoked, he gulped twice, turned almost
green and, getting up, staggered into a
seat further back. Truly, he who traverses
a wide desert without aid of water-
bottle never gasped with such agony as
your inveterate smoker waiting for next
month’s supply.

“Frank Jessup”: Pitt-street, Sydney,
near King-street, in the lunch-hour. A
big police car howling to a stop at the
kerb, a man running for his life, crouch-
ing, dodging cleverly through the close-
packed crowd with all the skill of a
champion footballer. About 40 yards
behind him a bulkier figure in pursuit,
dodging with much the same dexterity.
The first runner, turning into King-street,
falls on the wet roadway, skids several
yards on his shoulder, is up again and
disappears up the street, followed by his
pursuer. No, not the sequel to a smash-
and-grab affair ; just a police raid on an
unlicensed barrowman.

The Ephazone treatment brings swift relief from those
gasping, choking attacks familiar to the Asthma
sufferer. One small Ephazone tablet goes right to
the root of the trouble. As soon as it reaches the
stomach healing agents are released to dissolve the
germ-laden accumulations which clog the bronchial
tubes.
Don’t allow those Asthma attacks to develop.
Ephazone builds up resistance to future spasms
besides bringing almost instant relief in cases of
sudden attack.
Ephazone is equally invaluable in cases o £
Bronchitis. Bronchial Catarrh and Hay Fever.

THE SERVICE MAN
Mr. Chifley on
Communism.
“Ek Dum”: Mr. Chifley’s
speech on September 2 was
revealing, and probably would
have been more revealing if the
Opposition had not foolishly
denied him an extension of time.
He said that he believed that
Russia was prepared to push its
policy as far as it could with-
out causing war, to gain an
advantage—economic, territorial
or for the extension of Com-
munist ideology—but he did not
believe that the Russians wanted
war.
Such a statement from a Prime
Minister would usually be re-
assuring, but Mr. Chifley is so
often wrong in these matters
that the value of his assertions
usually goes by contraries.
Not so long ago he inferred
that war had now become push-
button conflict, not calling for
large manpower. But on this he
has been laughed to scorn by
the whole world.
He said that Communism was
merely a political philosophy or
ideology. But brutal terrorism
everywhere that Communism
operates, combined with larri-
kinism, deceit and a secretiveness
which forbids Communist-
organised bodies to admit Com-
munist connection, brand it as
a criminal foreign-based con-
spiracy designed to wreck the
democratic countries.
A few months ago he dis-
missed the likelihood of war.
Yet war threatens just round the
corner.
On Thursday he said that “no
sane man could believe that
proclaiming the Communist
party illegal would stop anybody
sympathetic with Communism.”
Proclaiming burglars illegal
has been known to have a very
decided effect upon burglary,
and the practice of Communism
is considerably more pernicious
than burglary, because in certain
circumstances it justifies anything
from murder downwards and be-
cause its operations cause a
wider ambit of suffering than
mere simple robbery.
Even if Mr. Chifley were in-
deed to believe that a declaration
of illegality against burglary
“For two pins I'd give it a miss this morning!"
would not stop people from sym-
pathising with the idea of bur-
glary, he is surely not in favor
of the Government providing
burglars with jemmies, picklocks
and other burgling tools and with
allowing them to own property
to be used for the purpose of
carrying on wholesale burglary,
newspapers to popularise it and
various other facilities, including
telephones, to promote it.
Yet that would be almost a
parallel to what Mr. Chifley and
his followers are doing with
the Communist party, which has
had Government telephones,
postal registrations for its news-
papers, petrol to burn, permits
to build when returned soldiers
were denied them, access to the
unions, and paper supplies—•
which were provided in 1943,
virtually illegally, and in contra-
vention of the agreement which
the Government had made with
the law-abiding press as to dis-
tribution. Communist papers,
after having been suppressed for
a long period because of subver-
sive activities, and having during
that period flouted the law in
the most flagrant manner, were
actually allowed a privilege
denied to every other paper in
Australia when they resumed
publication. They were allowed
to increase the size of their
journals abo v e that of
August, 1939, when, on the day
of the signing of the Russo-
Hitler agreement, they had actu-
ally doubled the weekly number
of their pages and taken new
titles.
Next Mr. Chifley in his speech
said Mr. Spender had suggested
that “the Australian Govern-
ment and the British Labor Gov-
ernment were appeasers of
Russia.” And in the next breath
he followed the Communist line
on Malaya. He said that
in Malaya there were 6,000,000
people whose cry was “Malaya
for the Malayans.”
There is no agitation on those
lines among Malays in general,
and Mr. Chifley must know it;
He continued:
Among the six million people
there are only 17,000 Europeans.
Among these Europeans there are a
great many who have no love of the
country but have gone there for profit;
This appears to be in his eyes
a crime, and it is) an echo
of what Moscow is saying. If
Europeans had not gone there
for profit both peace- and war-
time industry would have been
in a desperate position for
rubber and tin and a lot of
people who support Mr. Chifley
would have been out of work.
The six million people of Malaya
would have remained sunk in
savagery.
Singapore, like Shanghai,
Bombay and other cities, would
still be mudflats except for
“Europeans”—British, that is.
Chaos in Burma.

once the darling of the Com-
munists, turned into a “Fascist
beast” who immures Comrades
in jails and, according to the

3rd August, 1948.
The books and accounts of the General Bank Department of the Rural Bank of New South Wales have been examined
and audited, for the year ended 30 th June, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 29 and 30 of the Government
Savings Bank Act, 1906.
In my opinion, this Balance Sheet correctly sets out the financial position of the General Bank Department as at 30 th
June, 1948, according to the best of my information and to the explanations given to me and as shown by such books and accounts..
SYDNEY, 31st August, 1948.
E. H. SWIFT, Auditor General for N.S.W.
them, and with Malaya in a fer-
ment and Mr. Chifley declining
to interfere, Burma, the central
pivot of the Communist party’s
immediate plan for southern
Asia, is in complete chaos.
It is governed by a Ministry
not all of whose members are
free of the suspicion of a variety
of outrages in the past. It has
a Premier who was a few weeks
ago shouting that it was neces-
sary that his country should fol-
low Russian methods in framing
a constitution and that it should
break the British-American en-
circlement in Southern Asia and
strengthen its bonds with Mos-
cow. He is now yelling equally
loudly about the horrors of
Communist insurrection.
The confusion is understood
when it is known that there are
two brands of Communism
operating—the “white flags” on
the Prome railway round Pegu
and the “reds” in the Arakan
district, which the British Com-
monwealth lost so many lives to
defend and retake.
The Karens, a leading hill
tribe in the south, have adver-
tised the feebleness of the Gov-
ernment by seizing Moulmein
and Thaton, which cuts the rail-
way from that great port to
Rangoon and central Burman
plain. They have* proclaimed
themselves independent and set
up a military Government, which
has issued its ukase:
Our first task is to rid the whole
of Burma of Communism. That
includes the present Government,
which we know receives directives
from the Communist headquarters at
Calcutta. '
For all practical purposes the
Karens are masters of the
southern leg of Burma, which is
all to the good in view of the
condition of affairs in Siam and
northern Malaya.
Meanwhile the two lots of
Communists shout and fire guns
at innocents —that there are two
seems to be a Communist trick,
the technique being something
like that which is being played
in Eastern Europe.
The fourth lot of rebels, a
large band of military adven-
turers attracted by ambition and
anti-Communist feeling out of
the army and police forces, are
building up their strength.
The inept and hand-wringing
Attlee Government, which
allowed all this to develop with-
out moving a finger to prevent
it and in complete disregard of
the stern warnings of Mr.
Churchill and a hundred alarmed
people with knowledge who im-
plored it to be careful, is now
considering sending British
troops to save the 2200 British
in Burma from massacre.
Its muddled mind first
conceived the idea of getting
them out, but it has now decided
that it might be well to have
British troops on the spot.
Across the border in Malaya
the war is in full swing. Sir
Denis Boyd, retiring C.-in-C. of
the British Far Eastern Fleet,
has just gone to Singapore wear-
ing his flag in H.M.S. London.
A brigade of Guards left
Southampton on Sunday, and
that tardily, since affairs have
reached a stage in which terror-
ism rages from Johore Strait to
the Siamese boundary and no
white man’s life and no
Malay’s, either, if he does not
knuckle down to the Com-
munists —is safe for a moment.
Zhdanov Dies.
“Ek Dum”: On the day on
which Prague : celebrated the
fourth anniversary of the rising
against Tiso and the Germans,
as one of the three milestones on
the way to the building of a
“people’s democracy” —the other
two being allegedly the libera-
tion of Czechoslovakia by the
Red Army and the “defeat of the
agents of Western capitalism”
on February 28—strange events
were taking place behind and in
front of the Iron Curtain.
Nothing was said at the cele-
brations in compliment to poor
Benes, who lay dying allegedly
of a slow illness; nobody seems
to have mentioned the name of
Masaryk, who somehow fell
from a window in Prague. No-
body recalled that the United
States Army had to be held back
almost forcibly by its comman-
ders to prevent the great vic-
torious Red Army from losing
the honor of saving a Czecho-
slovakia which was already
saved.
And nobody presented statis-
tics to show that Dr. Peter
Zenkl, one of Dr. Benes’s fol-
lowers who arrived in London
that day, was the seventh Minis-
ter to escape from Czechoslo-
vakia since the glorious 28th of
February, He said that he had
found his last six months under
the shadow of Communism in
his native country worse than
his six years in Buchenwald: —
Since the Communist coup d’etat
my life has been in danger all the
time.
The roll of Czech Ms.P., out-
side the seven Ministers, who
have escaped since February 28,
now numbers 52, plus 13
generals.
Probably in view of the
preparations which were in pro-
gress to send the new bulging
Soviet Union Embassy to the
headquarters of the Indonesian
Republicans, a Dutch “investi-
gating-officer” working at the
Netherlands Legation was
arrested in Prague. His name
was Leonard us Bartolomeus van
Dam. His work was obtaining
death certificates of Nether-
lands citizens who died in con-
centration camps. And he was
accused of espionage for an un-
named foreign Power.
As in Communist countries
even the obtaining of a death
certificate might be esteemed as
espionage, he will undoubtedly
be found guilty with acclama-
tion, along with a number of
other Dutch citizens who are
said to be implicated.
Meanwhile in Russia there
was another sad bereavement.
Marshal Stalin’s deputy,
“General” Zhdanov, who had
been the dictator’s deputy since
1937—the fact was mentioned
in this paper then, though
press in general have found/t
out only in recent years—
perished of a heart condition
and was buried under the Krem-
lin wall in Red Square.
Already the rumor is being
spread that his death was
caused by the Titoites, but if
that were the case the whole
world would have known of it
by this time and every person
from Belgrade to Vladivostok
who was non persona grata with
the Kremlin would have had
good cause to fear the immedi-
ate future. What happened
when ' Marshal Stalin’s friend
Kirov (whom nearly all the
daily papers’ “experts” last
week insisted on calling Zirov)
was killed will be long remem-
bered by thousands of weeping
families. The facts about it read
like something out ,of the
bloodier years of the reign of
the gentle Assyrian, Assur-
banipal.
Whatever the cause, some fate
removed Comrade Zhdanov sud-
denly, and since he had been heir
apparent for so long, it seems
likely that the chances of M.
Molotov to become the next
Russian Fiihrer have been im-
proved considerably. The Aus-
tralian Communist pa r t y’s
journals are prostrated by a wave
of grief such as has never
assailed them when even the
most beloved British and United
States leaders have died —not
even when Mr. Roosevelt, who
conceded so much to Russia, to
the world’s present dire sorrow
and disturbance, passed over.
The British and U.S. represen-
tatives did not attend Zhdanov’s
funeral.
On the day following, Mr.
Sergei Lukin, Assistant Com-
missar for Light Industry, ex-
pired, also after “a long ill-
ness.” It seems to be almost an
epidemic.

PERSONAL ITEMS
There is no more vigorous believer in
Legacy than its new president, J. L,
Jamieson. He has little to say about him-
self, but plenty on the selfless organisa-
tion which is trying—and making an un-
commonly good job of it—to act father
to more than 250,000 youngsters who lost
their dads as a result of service in the
two wars. Begun in Tasmania 25 years
ago by John Gellibrand, the idea spread
to the mainland, and now 27 clubs are
operating throughout cities and country
centres in Australia, and, receiving no
Government grant, spend between 40
and 50 thousand pounds yearly on wel-
fare of young Legatees. As a climax of
the recent Legacy Week in Sydney to
raise funds, two youngsters, escorted by
V.C.-winners, laid wreaths on the Ceno-
taph. A point reports missed was that
the day had special significance for both
kiddies —it was the anniversary of their
fathers’ deaths in the last war.
Canon Horace Barder, rector of
century-old St. Mark’s, Darling Point,
Sydney, is the antithesis of the popular
conception of a cleric. Well over 6ft.,
and sideways in proportion, he has a
voice and handgrip to match. Born in
Victoria, he taught in N.S.W. State
schools for 10 years before ordination.
His first independent charge was at
Naremburn, North Sydney. The Canon
thought his church’s lOOth birthday a fit
time to write its history, and his delving
into last-century registers and minute-
books provided material for a 300-page
book, due off the presses shortly. He
has titled it from the well-known hymn,
“Wherein My Honor Dwells.” The
Barder family, five of them, is unique in
that all its members are in the Sydney
Uni. calendar; mother an M.A.,
daughter B.Sc., elder son M.D., younger
boy in second-year dentistry and the
Canon himself an M.A. He has two pas-
sions : one, gardening, he satisfies ; the
other, travel, he says he has left too late.
To be released soon in Sydney, the
Navy’s picture “Always Another Dawn”
will remind Captain F. B. Bryce-Morris,
R.A.N., of his film experiences; he
commanded Australian destroyer Nepal
when Noel Coward and his team were
aboard filming the sea sequences for “In
Which We Serve.” It was remarked in
naval-gunnery circles at the time that
gun-crews were particularly nippy
with their drill. They were nippy all
over: locale of the action was in the
balmy Med., requiring tropical shorts
and shirts, but actual filming took place
in an English winter. Bryce-Morris, the
navigator who conned cruiser Canberra
at speed down through the Barrier Reef
(B. 18/8/’4B), is now captain of Garden
Island dockyard.
When a boost of publicity takes you
to a Columbia picture, the urging spirit
will have been Tom Dole, now running
that side for the company in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. At 31,
six years of which were spent in the
A.1.F., three of them in Changi camp,
Dole is one of the youngest directors in
the game. He was first sold on advertising
by Jack Donnelly, The Bulletin’s
recently-retired stereo-department head.
After a brief spell reporting for a Sydney
daily and a term as publicity officer for
a big import group’s Far Eastern interests.
Dole ballooned into his present job. In
between thinking up superlatives he is
dovetailing the writing of a play about
life in Changi guest-house.
“Uramao”: Appointed personal pilot
to Lord Tedder, Squadron-Leader J. A.
Gibson, D. 5.0., D.F.C., is another
Maorilander to gain an important posi-
tion in the R.A.F.—Air Chief-Marshal
Keith Park is an Aucklander. Gibson
got his flying experience in the Battle for
Britain and in Pacific operations. As he
fills a similar job for Lord Montgomery,
he holds two of the Empire’s greatest de-
fenders in his keeping. Whenever they
travel by air both leaders fly in their pri-
vate Dakotas with Gibson, who is also a
flight-commander in No. 24 (Empire)
Squadron,
When he, died in the south of France
on January 28, 1939, poet W. B. Yeats
was buried there, at Roquebrune, Cap
Martin ; but he had expressed a wish
that his final resting-place should be
Ireland, and now at last Ireland it’s to
be. War-time and other difficulties have
hitherto prevented, but the Eire
corvette Macha is carrying the poet’s re-
mains to Sligo Bay for reburial this
month in a plot of ground outside the
church at Drumcliffe, County Sligo,
whereabouts Yeats lived for years and
did much of his writing. It’s to be a
State funeral.
All three initial commanders of our
new carrier group in H.M.A. carrier
Sydney are Englishmen, and all had on-
the-spot experience of the last scrap.
Group-commander is Lt.-Cdr. Paul Whit-
field, D. 5.0., R.N., who flew Swordfish
and Barracudas early in the piece and
later transferred to a fleet carrier in the
Pacific. His last job was 0.-i.-c. of the
Royal Navy’s deck-landing training
school in Scotland, His two offsiders,
commanding the Sea Fury fighter squad-
ron and the Firefly strike, recco and
anti-submarine unit respectively, are Lt.-
Cdr. Bailey and Lt.-Cdr. Coxon. Bailey
led Seafires in the Med. during the Salerno
dust-up and Coxon flew both Fireflies and
Firebrands.
Youth and age are welded into a stoutly-
pulling team aboard the old Port Phillip
tug Sprightly. At 79 she must be the
oldest working tug in Australian waters,
and although a forceful meeting with a
freighter in Geelong Harbor sent her to
the bottom and laid her up for two years,
she has plenty of tow left in her yet.
Her skipper, Ted Parker, is a comparative
youth of 33. His step-up to the bridge
took only seven years, which in most
cases is about enough to make a good
able-seaman.
In Australia to lecture on child-welfare
Prof. J. C. Spence, M.C., M.D., F.R.C.P.,
Nuffield Professor of Child Health at
Durham University. Dealing largely with
prevention of disease, his department’s
work is concerned more with homes than
with hospitals; he believes that segregat-
ing children in age-groups prevents the
development of speech and mentality
which mixing with older children would
engender. Prof. Spence, at one time
house physician to Great Ormond-street
Hospital for sick children, has made
youngsters his particular interest.
With a tentative site five miles s.-e. of
Warwick marked for a Queensland Boys’
Town, Father T. V. Dunlea* has begun
another home for his “Australian
migrants for Australia.” The main show
at Engadine (N.S.W.) is run by a mayor,
aldermen, building inspectors and trades-
men, none of whom is much more than
about two kerosene-tins tall. The priest

another Boys’ Town in Queensland.
gathers them in from slums and Juvenile
Courts, young devils who through family
example or neglect are potential jail-
fillers, and, by simple human kindness
'and application of shrewd psychology,
in which the prime object is to make the
child realise he is loved, he turns them
loose as responsible citizens with a trade
behind them. What he doesn’t know
about boys simply isn’t knowledge.
Dubois drew the accompanying likeness
some time ago when Father Dunlea’s
first protege returned to see him, an up-
standing youth in airman’s uniform. The
priest’s look of appraisal speaks for it-
self.
Off to Nigeria to fill the professorship
of chemistry at the University of Ibadan,
one of two new institutions in West
Africa, Dr. R. J. Mcllroy, of Christ-
church, is a graduate of Wellington’s Vic-
toria College. He toojc his M.A. degree
and later studied at Birmingham Uni-
versity, where he received a doctorate of
philosophy, and was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Institute of Chemistry. Eight
years ago he joined the tutorial staff at
Canterbury University College, as senior
lecturer in organic chemistry.
J. Jungwirth, in charge of the Victorian
end of the Royal-tour arrangements, is
an old hand at the game. He was secre-
tary of the State Reception Committees
on the similar occasions of 1927 and
1934. He left for England last week.
Coventry pictures here the face of
M. A. Pearce, C.B.E. —“George” to his
intimates —new chairman of the S.A.
State Bank. Pearce could be called The
Great Organiser. At present secretary
to Tom Play ford, he has looked after six
Premiers —three Liberal and three Labor.
“GEORGE” PEARCE,
S.A. Royal-tour organiser.
In 1935 he went to London with Richard
Butler for George V’s Silver Jubilee;
earlier he had helped to organise Ade-
laide’s welcome to the Royal couple, then
Duke and Duchess of York, and he was
again in the picture in 1934 when the
Duke of Gloucester visited South Aus-
tralia. As State director of Royal tour
arrangements, Pearce will next year see
plans for his best effort to date come to
fruition. His most prominent feature is
concerned not only with nosing out times
and routes —it is used to advantage in his
rose-garden. Here flower 250 varieties
—in organised rows.
Back from U.S.A., Dr. Les Jauncey,
Ph.D., is at present resident in Melbourne.
Born in S.A. in f 899 and a product' of
Adelaide’s Prince Alfred College, Dr.
Jauncey obtained his Harvard Doctorate
of Philosophy in Economics in 1929 with
a thesis on King O’Malley’s Common-
wealth Bank. The same year he was
Associate-Professor at the University of
New Mexico and head of its Economics
Department. In 1932 he returned to Aus-
tralia, where he made a further study of
the Commonwealth Bank, the result
appearing in his book Australia’s Com-
monwealth Bank; another book, The
Story of Conscription in Australia, was
published in 1935.
Maorilander Warwick Braithwaite,
new conductor at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, toured these parts as
A.B.C. guest conductor a year or so ago.
Before taking over his new orchestra he
will tour with the Sadler Wells Ballet as
principal conductor at the Edinburgh
Festival, the Paris Opera House, and the
British zone in Berlin.
J. E. Cassidy, K.C. —likeness here by
Prior —has appeared twice before the
Privy Council: for leave to appeal in the
Bell-Hocking case in 1946, and to finish it
off the next year. He found there none
of the impassioned rhetoric of the Law
Courts; reading conversationally to the
J. E. CASSIDY, K.C.
five Law Lords in street clothes seated at
a crescent-shaped table in a quiet room
at No. 9 Downing-street, he felt more like
a secretary presenting his report at a com-
pany board-meeting than an advocate in
the Empire’s highest court. Behind a
door in one corner was, in theory, the
King—the Council is His Majesty’s
judicial committee, and until recently a
vacant chair was set in case he dropped
in. From London Cassidy had a look in
at the Nuremburg trials, then struck off
on a 1000-mile tour of Germany. Among
Australia’s legal hierarchy, Cassidy adds
to his gifts of advocacy a fresh and
pleasant countenance, and a haid-
working, analytic mind.
“Recco”: Back from the R.A.F. Staff
College, Group-Captain I. S. Podger,
D.F.C., was Director of Operations at
Air Board before going overseas, and is
an ex-member of No. 10 Sunderland
Squadron. He joined the R.A.A.F. in
1937 and was in England two months
before Flitler broke loose. As captain
of a Sunderland, in December, 1940, he
picked up a flashing light just before
dawn 200 miles out in the Atlantic.
Podger brought his big craft down in
a choppy sea alongside a lifeboat and
took its 21 occupants aboard. All were
in a bad way, and so was Podger: with
the extra load in a rising sea, bumping
from crest to crest, it was no routine take-
off. But he managed it, and the job won
him a D.F.C. Joining in the Jap scrap
in 1942, he finished up in charge of the
Northern Area Command round New
Guinea.
Into the silence; —•
At Albury, at 75, Alfred Waugh, who as the
city’s Mayor during the Melbourne Centenary
Air Race collected scores of cars and posi-
tioned them round the storm-bound aerodrome
with their lights shining across it. Dutch
pilots circling above made a safe landing on
the best-lighted strip they’d struck since Eng-
land. Waugh organised Albury’s own centenary.
At Jamestown (S.A.), at 103, Mrs. Mary
Martin, who remembered her trip out from
England in the windjammer Punjab in 1855.
Her husband, who died at 94, fought in the
Crimean War. Mrs. Martin claimed that her
father and 13 of his brothers were at Waterloo.
In London, at 72, Frederick Young, chair-
man of the E., S', and A. Bank, and a former
Agent-General for South Australia. Before
going to Britain he was a member of the S.A.
Assembly, and from 1918-22 he held a seat in
the Commons.
In London, at 80, William Clark, a Melbourne
stockbroker, who until recently owned Windle-
sham Moor, in Surrey, now the country resi-
dence of Princess Elizabeth. A racing man, he
owned The Victory, winner of the Birthday
Cup and the Melbourne Cup in 1902.
In Wellington (M.L.), at 87, Robert Percy
Mackay, last of the early whalers. He served
in the barque Splendid, which the Otago Whal-
ing Co. operated on the M.L. coast in the
’seventies. He maintained that the Splendid
was the ship round which Frank Bullen wrote
his Cruise of the Cacheht.
At .St. Arnaud’s (Vic.), Bob Hart, reputed to
have been the First A.l.F.’s tallest member. He
was 6ft. 7in.
At 83, in Brisbane, Bishop George Halford,
who founded the Bush Brotherhood at Long-
reach in 1897. Wealthy when he retired 16
years ago, he spent most of his money on
establishing the now-extinct monastic Order of
Witness.
At Heidelberg Military Hospital, aged 54,
Colonel Rupert Sadler, D. 5.0., M.C., an Anzac,
and veteran of both World Wars. In peace-
time he was with B.G.E.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
St. Mark’s at Darling Point, the
starting-off point for matrimony for
Sydney’s most fashionable, held its 100th
birthday last Saturday. There was a
centenary garden party, at which the
Rector, Canon H. W. A. Barder, and
Mrs. Barder received their guests —200
or more parishioners. Some of the ladies
had been brides blessed by St. Mark’s ;
some had walked the aisles as brides-
maids ; some had been christened at its
font. Other names closely connected
with the church were those of Mrs.
Howard Lea and Miss Monica Flower.
The eight bellringers who attempted to
ring Grandsire Triples of 5040 changes
on the bells of St. Mark’s had to call it a
day after ringing 2520 changes. Still,
that’s a pretty good effort.
In Amsterdam the ageing Queen of the
Netherlands, Wilhelmina, drove through
the flower-decked streets, her subjects
wildly cheering in her honor. Queen
Wilhelmina has reigned for 50 years, and
the procession marked not only her golden
jubilee, but the eve of her abdication be-
cause of failing health. In Sydney the
Consul-General for the Netherlands and
Mrs. Zylstra gave a big cocktail party so
that compatriots and Australian friends
might join in the celebrations. The Vice-
Consul for the Netherlands, newly arrived
from Hong Kong, helped to receive the
guests.
Up at the Y.W.C.A. it is just one
thing after another. Last week Arts and
Crafts held the stage and the floor of
the Main Hall. This exhibition —the
work of Y.W. students —was opened by
Sydney’s Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bartley.
Forty students took part in the Crafts
Parade, where the latest styles in day,
evening and sports wear were displayed
—on the girls who had made them. All
the patterned materials were hand-printed
by the wearers. Handcrafts diplomas
were presented to nine successful students,
who now are fully-fledged instructors.
These classes at Y.W. are steadily
increasing in popularity and are
attended by more than 1100 women
and girls. On September 15, 16 and 17
there will be an orchid show run in con-
junction with the Orchid Society of
N.S.W., and on Saturday, 18, there will
be a fete and garden inspection at Ad-
miralty House.
It’s always a case of haste to the wed-
ding when any of the Mandurama
Fagans are being married. They
all get married early in the morning
—somewhere round 10 o’clock. Last
Saturday morning Bill Fagan carried
on the tradition of the family, and
at 10 in the morning wed his Coralie
Kelly, than whom it’s safe to say
St. Mary’s has blessed no prettier
bride. As usual in Fagan weddings, Dr.
Norton, Bishop of Bathurst, officiated,
and later at the Australia made eloquent
and friendly speech.
The September morning stirred in a
light breeze, and the new Mrs. Fagan, a
sherbet of white tulle and lace, carrying
white orchids in her lace-mittened hands,
fluttered down the steps rather like spring
herself. Effective descent, too, was made
by bridesmaid June Bennett, in long and
swaying hyacinth-pinks. ’Groom’s mother,
Mrs. R. Fagan, of Sunnyridge, Man-
durama, wore a frock of ice-blue silk
patterned in amethyst foliage. Over this
was a coat nipped in at the waist and
very flared, the shade of red violets. Mrs.
M. F. Kelly, the bride’s mother, down
with her husband from Berry, was very
smart in brown with touches of
blue. The pale-pink woollen frock and
sapphire-blue flared coat of the ’groom’s
sister, Mrs. Mit Loneragan, were ad-
mired ; so was Mrs. John Woods’s beige-
and-brown ensemble, and Mrs. Cliff
Gearin’s" hydrangea-blues and the pink
jasmine flowers caught in the veil of. her
small hat. Scintillating in the sunlight
and deserving honorable mention was
Mrs. Fagan’s handbag—a mesh of semi-
precious sapphires and rubies.
The Netherlands Society had a grand
rally at the Pickwick Club on Saturday
evening. This was the final celebration
in honor of Queen Wilhelmina’s Golden
Jubilee.
The closing of the Lute Drummond
Testimonial was one of the happiest
affairs last week. And the nicest thing
about it was that Lute was there herself
—almost back to her old-time health —
with the bright animation she has never
lost throughout the past dark months. She
sparkled in a graceful off-white frock that
swirled about her feet. In short, she
made the party that was held in the
Pickwick Club. This started with cock-
tails and went on to a buffet dinner and
a programme of music. Carrie Lanceley,
Gwladys Evans, Gladys Verona, and
Alice Prowse were the singers, Lettie
Keyes and Mr. Koletz the pianists;
Lucille Brunkell recited.
Florence Taylor, president of the com-
mittee, handsome in sequin-crusted black
crepe, handed out with proper pride the
cheque which, when the last shekel has
been shaken out, will make the total
about £l2OO. Some of the cheques
came from Lute’s former pupils in Eng-
land —there was one from Kenneth Neate
for 35 guineas (English), and he told in
his letter of engagements for appear-
ances in Paris, and three consecutive
opera seasons in London. Salvos
of applause greeted Florence’s presenta-
tion speech, and the sincere thanksgiving
of Lute. Among the 60 guests were Mrs.
A. E. Grace", Josephine Marks and othei
committee workers.
On September 30 in the Town Hall
Hephzibah Menuhin will play with the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, directed
by Paul Klecki, guest conductor for the
A.B.C: Last week the pretty and talented
pianist (sister of the great Yehudi) came
to Sydney for her Saturday night’s con-
cert with the Musica Viva String
Quartet. Town Hall listeners admired
the masterly music of the programme—
Beethoven and Brahms would have ad-
mired it themselves. Admired also was
Hephzibah’s frock, very pictorial. It was
of moire patterned in black and prim-
rose. A supper-party at the Savarin fol-
lowed the concert.
A note from Bert A. Farrin, manager
of the R.A.A.F. Memorial Centre Appeal,
tells of arrangements for the Air Force
Commemoration Week. The Anniversary
of the Battle of Britain this year will be
a top-flight R.A.A.F. Commemoration
Concert to be held in the Town Hall on
September 21. This concert should wear
at least Air-Marshal decoration. Igor
Hmelnitsky is the solo pianist on the pro-
gramme. There will be a full symphony
orchestra and a choir of 60 voices. Albert
Aden’s “Alamein Concerto” and “Song of
England” will be featured, also George
English’s “Commemoration Fantasia.”
Evelyn Hall, James Wilson, Werner Baer,
William GateSj John Cameron, Ivan
Rixon and Mayne Lynton are others who
will add lustre to the night.
The Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron
is getting ready for the opening day of
the 1948-49 yachting season. Satur-
day, September 25, is the date to re-
member. Sailing and rowing races will
take place, to start and finish off the
squadron, and a garden party will be
held in the club gardens.
One morning recently there was a
mild flurry of excitement at V.A.D. head-
quarters in Jamieson-street. Mrs. John
Northcott, wife of the State Governor,
had morning-tea at the Red Cross V.A.D.
clubroom. Chairman of the division, J.
F. Clack, and hon. director of Red Cross
V.A.D., Mrs. Persia Porter, received Mrs.
Northcott. The commandants of the
V.A. detachments were presented to the
Governor’s wife, and during each intro-
duction explanatory commentary of the
detachment’s work was given by Mrs.
Porter.
Patricia, fair-haired second daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Coen, of Vaucluse,
who went off to England some months
ago, has just cabled her parents news of
her engagement to Captain Michael
Fernley Turner-Bridger, of the Cold-
stream Guards and Godaiming, Surrey.
The University Settlement Council is
busy on preparations for the annual
fete in aid of settlement funds to
be held at the University on September
25. Mrs. Macdonald Holmes, wife of the
Professor of Geography, is president of
the committee.
“Rationing Staff Slashed.” Heading in
one of Sydney’s evening papers. But
you must admit it’s not quite so harsh
as the announcement two or three months
back that radio staff was cut in half up
Singapore way.
From Melbourne
Bowls of beautiful spring flowers
decorated the reception-rooms of the
Town Hall when the Lieut.-Covernor,
Sk Edmund Herring, formally opened the
British Memorial Fund, of which E. R.
Reynolds, M.L.A., is chairman. One
hundred thousand Victorians will be
asked to sign this first national autograph-
book, which their Majesties the King and
Queen will be asked to receive when they
come next year. Signatures in the book
.will be one of the main sources for build-
ing up the basic capital of the British
Memorial, which has been initially set as
£300,000. The memorial is to be estab-
lished to honor the tremendous war effort
of the people of Britain, especially during
the crucial time of 1940-41, when Britain
stood alone against the Axis Powers. It
will be a Rhodes Scholarship in reverse,
for a system of endowed visits by selected
individuals, or groups, from the British
Isles, or from other countries of the
British Commonwealth, will be the objec-
tive. They will come as holders of Fel-
lowships or Scholarships, entitling them
to a course of study or research in this
country. Those selected for the endowed
visits will be drawn from a wide variety
of occupations. Fellowships will be
granted for research work and scholar-
ships will be for school and university
courses.
Sir Edmund was first to sign the
Memorial Book. Mrs. Reynolds, who re-
ceived the guests with her husband, wore
a jacket-suit of sage-green which had a
pleated skirt, a rust-red blouse and a
draped beret to match the blouse. Mrs.
R. G. Ritchie, who is chairman of the
Countrywomen’s section of the fund,
chose a smart black ensemble highlighted
with gold ornaments. Lady Knox’s grey
wool coat was worn over a black frock;
her small grey bowler hat was feather-
trimmed. Mrs. Henry Steel wore a small
brown hat with her brown fur coat. Mrs.
H. E. Benton’s black osprey-trimmed hat,
black suit and furs made smart alliance.
Mrs. David Ely’s black moire taffeta
jacket-suit was worn with a spring hat of
white straw trimmed with pink roses.
Pink and black feathers trimmed the
black hat which Mrs. J. J. Daly’wore with
her black suit and silver-fox furs.
The gracious lady pictured here is this
city’s new Lady Mayoress, Mrs. James S.
Disney. Her husband has been a City
Councillor for 13 years, but she has
shunned the limelight, preferring her
home and garden. A lover of flowers, the
well-planned garden of their Auburn
home is a delight. Mrs. Disney is on the
committee of the Sutherland Homes for
Children and patroness of the women’s
committee of the United Nations Appeal.
She will bring distinction and charm to
the important duty of hostess to the King
and Queen next year.
First social engagement of the new
Lady Mayoress was a supper-party in
her reception-room at the Town Hall.
Her guests included Sir Edmund and
Lady Herring, Sir Owen and Lady
Dixon, Air-Marshal George Jones and
merfibers of the organising committee of
the exhibition “Our British Heritage,”
which Sir Edmund had just opened. The
exhibition, which is being held in the
Lower Town Hall, was arranged by the
women’s group of the Royal Empire
Society, of which Lady Dixon is presi-
dent. Mrs. Disney wore a smart grey
ensemble to which was added a beige fox
cape and pastel-blue hat.
On a dais covered with apple-green
velvet, with black velvet back drapes and
coyly hidden under pastel green, it stood
until unveiled by‘Howard Settle, the new
Australian car, Holden, smooth and
lovely in dove-grey, with lines as graceful
as a mannequin and dove-grey upholstery
to match. Before the unveiling the press
was lunched in the Australia’s Marina-
room and after the —er —launching cock-
tails were served at General Motors-
Holden’s factory, Fishermen’s Bend.
Howard Bettle, managing-director, was
host, assisted by Jack Horne, publicity
man, and his assistant, former Bulletin
artist K. Wallace Crabbe.
Marigolds and daffodils in the colors of
the Royal House of Orange made gay the
Toorak home of Colonel F. H. Wright
(he’s Consul for the Netherlands) and
Mrs. Wright, when Dutch nationals and
the Consular Corps were entertained at a
late-afternoon party. It was to celebrate
the Golden Jubilee and birthday of Queen
Wilhelmina, and many of the feminine
guests wore orange ribbon bows. Mrs.
Wright wore a black crepe romaine frock
with a black satin bustle bow and fine
black lace on the neckline. Her daughter,
Mrs. Ronald Marriott, chose dark royal-
blue corduroy, her small hat trimmed
with matching ostrich feathers. A visiting
American, Mrs. E. A. B. Wilmer, was in
a black crepe bolero frock with black
ospreys on her hat. Her daughter, Mrs.
Heathcote Wright, daughter-in-law of the
host and hostess, wore an aqua-blue
ensemble, and Mrs. J. Pieters was attrac-
tive in a ballerina frock of green velvet.
Her hat was of fine black straw. Mrs.
J. Le Roy, in a tailored frock under
a grey lamb coat and small brown Dutch
bonnet, was there. So were Mrs. E.
Leitch, in navy blue with a small floral
hat, and Mrs. A. A. Nicolades, wife of
the Consul for Greece, in a black suit
and white blouse to match her smart little
white straw beribboned toque. Mrs.
Clarence Marriott contrasted her black
tailored coat with a wide-brimmed red
hat trimmed with black feathers, and Mrs. *
Martin Wang, wife of China’s Consul,
chose a long dusty-pink gown piped in
blue and covered with a silver-fox cape.
Trevor Neuendorf was with his fiancee,
Anna Ter Meulen, whose smart outfit
featured black with white accessories.
There were some lovely frocks worn on
stage in the gay, amusing and very
Cowardish “Present Laughter” at the
Princess. The Simone frock worn by
Margaret Reid in the first act must have
made many women crave for an hour-
glass figure. Fashioned of lavender-blue
French silk foulard, the skirt had side-
draped panniers. This creation contrasted
effectively with the primrose three-
quarters belted coat worn by Daphne
Newton with a pencil-slim black skirt.
Most striking was the ball dress worn by
Madi Hedd in tHe second act. The tight-
fitting black velvet bodice was strapless ;
the skirt was of black moire taffeta,
with a stiffened peplum forming a bustle
at the back, while an inset panel of
black velvet formed a slight train. A
wide platina-fox stole was added.
Some strong competition in frocking
was offered from stalls and d.c. Mrs.
Frank Tait’s black sequin-spangled sari
added distinction to her sequin-trimmed
black gown. Margaret Cochran’s tight-
fitting, fur-trimmed, old-gold velvet jacket
was worn with a bouffant skirt of slipper-
satin in the same shade. White taffeta
and silver lame formed the stunning gown
worn by Mrs. Garnet Carroll. Daphne
Rye, producer of the play, wore a black
evening gown and platina-fox stole. Mrs.
Leo Britt covered her white moire taffetas
with a shoulder cape of royal-blue ostrich
feathers. Mrs. Michael Ryan’s ballerina
frock was of soft rose-pink satin. Striped
taffeta was Mrs. King Cornell’s choice.
Mrs. Alan Michaelis allied slim black
skirt, brilliant-red jacket and sable scarf.
Lady Robinson wore black velvet under
her full-length squirrel coat. Mrs. Ron
Decker’s midnight-blue crepes were
sequin-trimmed, her short bolero of dyed
ermine. Lady Fraser was in black, with
silver-foxes added ; her daughter Peggy
chose ruby velvet with a white-fox cape.
Breathtaking clothes fashioned from
a wealth of materials, including satins,
velvets, taffetas and the less spectacular
cottons, were worn with true French chic
by the four Parisian mannequins and the
two pretty Australians who are also in
the entourage. The premiere night in
the Myer Mural Hall was a memorable
one ; the gowns bore such famous names
as Patou, Lanvin, Molyneux and Jacques
Path. Happiest among the guests was
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell, in deep-cyclamen
chiffons, when it was announced that the
Children’s Orthopaedic Hospital at Frank-
ston and the Crippled Children’s Appeal
would share the profits of the night:
£lOOO. Lady Herring was in the official
party; her gown was of black Chantilly
lace. Diamonds set off Mrs. Sydney
Baillieu Myer’s black satins. The hip-
length white taffeta jacket which Mrs.
Norman Myer wore with her black frock
featured the latest swing back. Mrs.
Ken Myer added a scarf of matching
lace, with the pattern outlined in tiny
crystals, to her white lace gown.
Mrs. Mary Hordern’s flame-colored
crepe gown was wprn with a black bolero.
Mrs. Phillip Dare’s slim-fitting aqua
crepe gown had the neckline outlined in
tiny sea-green beads. Mrs. John Vincent
wore a russet-brown frock trimmed with
gold sequins. Old-gold net over a bouf-
fant taffeta gown was Mrs. Eric Avery’s
choice. The full, swinging white-wool
coat worn by Lady Clarke was heavily
embroidered in black beads across the
back of the shoulders. The full-skirted
gown worn by Mrs. James Buchanan
was of embroidered white linen.

This big and efficient organisation,
backbone of Australia’s heavy industries,
is an example of the scientific precision,
flexible craftsmanship and successful in-
tegration of the various processes that
follow each other in conversion of iron-
ore to steel, which the co. turns out
cheaper than the’ stuff can be had any-
where else in the world. And it has a
large programme of development ahead
at Port Kembla and Whyalla which will
call for capital expenditure of “very con-
siderable magnitude,” the chairman says;
but he gave no hint as to how the ex-
penditure would be financed, or when
shareholders would be called upon to
assist, or to what extent.
In association with its subsidiary (A.I.
and S., which is doubling its own steel
output capacity), the co. is about to erect
a million-ton-a-year hot-cold strip mill
and tinplate plant adjacent to the steel-
works at Kembla. American experts—
United Engineering and Foundry Co.,
Pittsburgh—will provide the engineering
services in connection with design and
construction. The work, and therefore
outlay is to be spread over
several years, and will be pushed ahead
as fast as labor and delivery of materials
permit.
At Whyalla the electric-steel and forge
plant, built for the Government during
the war, has been taken over, and a
marine-engine and general-purpose gear-
cutting shop—a valuable adjunct to the
shipbuilding yards—is to be put up along-
side. Also, plans have been prepared for
erection of a completely integrated steel-
works, but it will be some years before a
start is made with the work.
Anticipating its benefits the market
prices the f.-p. pound shares at 595. 3d.,
giving an immediate return of 2.8 p.c. on
an 8.3 p.c. div. basis. The investor at
595. 9d. who looks for approximately
3.5 p.c. on his money from an 8 p.c. div.
counts on a one-for-two new share issue
at par. Assuming such an issue to be
made by 8.H.P., it would lift paid capital
to £20,827,353, on which 8 p.c. would call
for £1,666,188, or £410,800 more profit
than was claimed last term, but £174,222
less than the combined net earnings of
parent and subsidiaries, including outside
interests —capital and reserves held by
outside interests together total £2,255,514.
Subject to political and other develop-
ments beyond the management’s control,
appearances are that the co. should have
no difficulty in paying 8 p.c., or more in
the long run, on £20,827,353 of capital.
The improvement of £34,037 in B.H.P.’s
total profit figure (£1,255,388) was due to
better returns from subsidiaries (£205,986,
up £161,279) and general investments, etc.
(£287,301, up £115,995). Profit on the
co.’s own trading (£762,101) was £243,236
lighter, despite a lift in selling prices be-
fore the close of accounts in 1947 and a
small increase in output:

Spasmodic deliveries of an inadequate
supply of coal and shortage of labor kept
production around two-thirds of plant
capacity. Costs in the steel industry, per-
haps more than in any other, are affected
by the level of output. They stepped up
steeply last term following wage lifts and
introduction of the 40-hour week. The
£1,255,388 of profit from all sources was
a shade over 9 p.c. on capital as against
8.8 p.c. for the previous year. That leaves
out of the reckoning £125,000 transferred
from tax reserve and a capital profit of
£61,899 on sale of assets. The div. was
lifted from 1? p.c. to 8.3 p.c.

Last term’s £1,840,410 (up £109,597) of
profit was 7.2 p.c. on shareholders’ funds
(£25,560,956), whereas the parent’s 8.3 p.c.
div. called for only 4.2 p.c. on these funds.
Though the group is earning more for the
Government than for shareholders, no
relief from the heavy burden of co. taxa-
tion has been granted in the Federal
Budget. Also, industry is being bled by
what amounts to a capital tax in the
matter of depreciation—on the basis of
post-war replacement costs actual pro-
vision for depreciation is necessarily far
in excess of the amount allowed for taxa-
tion purposes.
Mechanisation of the co.’s collieries —
they compare favorably with any
other coalmines in the world —is being
steadily pushed ahead ; about 84 p.c. of
present output is mechanically cut. It is
the limitation of output by petty stop-
pages and the darg that receive a lugu-
brious welcome. •
At the shipyards (Whyalla) two 6000-
ton freighters were built during the year
for the Government, and two more are
under construction. Also, the first of
four 12,500-ton vessels for the co.’s own
trade was launched, and two more are on
the stocks. This trade will include
carriage of iron-ore from Cockatoo
Island, Yampi Sound, where development
and construction work is almost complete,
to the steelworks at Newcastle and
Kembla.

For many years the trustee cos., of
which Perpetual is Australia’s largest,
had a hard struggle against prejudice.
Then, as the advantages of the corporate
over the private trustee became apparent,
more business came their way, and still
more has been driven into their expert
care by the present bewildering tangle
of legal and financial controls associated
with the administration of estates. Now
the tussle is mainly one against costs',
which are still on the up-grade—removals
of some Government subsidies have yet
to work themselves out through the
general price and wage levels.
The corpus and other moderate com-
mission charges made by trustee cos. are
anchored by legislation, and have re-
mained unchanged since the closing
decades of last century. Also, earnings of
the cos. have been retarded by the
official blanket thrown over capital values
and rents, and by the Government’s fre-
quent turns of the cheap-money screw.
The recent decision of the McGirr Gov-
ernment in N. S. Wales: to release sale of
urban land from control is a belated
step in the right direction; but much
more remains to be done before the fic-
titious set of values —now discredited and
largely disregarded—which the Federal
Treasury set upon real estate are entirely
eliminated.
Trusts put on the Perpetual’s books
last term exceeded the value of those
wound-up by £1,081,459, and gross earn-
ings increased by £10,409:

But exes, (up £10,990) won the race by
£5Bl. That was after allowing some-
thing for depreciation, taxation and the
staff fund. Including a net addition of
£lO9O to the corpus reserve (now
£144,453, which is the unearned portion
of corpus commissions), the net result
was £27,344 (down £541), or 13.6 p.c. on
capital as against 13.9, 14.5, 12.1, 13.3
and 12.9 p.c. back to 1943. The div., of
which 2? p.c. is labelled bonus, was kept
at 12? p.c. for the third year in succes-
sion ; for nine years before that a steady
10 p.c. was paid.
Though shareholders in this and other
cos. are to be granted a little relief by
way of income-tax reduction they, unlike
most wage- and salary-earners, have been
quite inadequately recompensed for the
rise in living costs, and have had to bear
a proportionately heavier burden of taxa-
tion. Considering that their influence on
the inflationary spiral has been a retarding
one, more generous tax treatment might
have been expected now from any but a
socialist-minded Treasurer.
There is £300,232 of reserves support-
ing and assisting £200,000 of paid capi-
tal. Assuming the two combined turn in
3? p.c. net, then the trustee section of
the business need net only 2.6 d. per £lOO
to cover 12? p.c. on capital alone. It is
plain from actual results that the co. is
giving clients a wide and efficient service
very cheaply.
At end June freehold figured at
£107,500 (worth a lot more), equipment
£7495, Government securities £248,431,
mortgages, etc., £129,142, debtors and
cash £110,195. Including the final div.
and provision for taxation, liabilities
totalled £82,532.
With one eye upon costs, the market
recently priced the £lO shares paid to £2
—the other £8 is a reserve liability pay-
able only in the event of liquidation—at
£5 10s., giving a return of 4.5 p.c. on a
12.? p.c. div. basis. Cover is £5 in net
tangibles.

With branches at Wollongong and
Brisbane, the engineering and hardware-
merchandising business of Noyes Bros.
(Sydney) has a wider ambit than its
name suggests. The title serves, however,
to distinguish the co. from Noyes Bros.
(Melbourne), Ltd., which is under en-
tirely separate management nowadays.
In the case of the Sydney concern, only
preference capital is held by the
public. Most of the ords. remained with
the Noyes family until 1945, when they
were bought by “a group of the princi-
pal suppliers for whom the co, has acted
as distributor for many years.” The
£70,000 ordinary capital is now distri-
buted thus:
British Electric Transformer Co.,
Ltd., England £14,000
Crompton Parkinson, Ltd., Eng-
land 12,000
Crompton Parkinson (Aust.) Pty.,
Sydney 11,000
Derby Cables, Ltd., England .. .. 14,000
. F. and A. Parkinson, Ltd., Eng-
land 14,000
Holdings of Noyes directors .. .. 5,000
£70,000
Directorates of the British holding cos.,
especially Crompton Parkinson, are well
represented on the Noyes board.
Preference capital comprises 30,000
9 p.c. firsts and 14,870 7 p.c. seconds.
Most of the seconds were issued from re-
serves in 1937 to pay dividend arrears
on the firsts, which had been passed over
for five years in the depression. A re-
shuffle of management and reorganisa-
tion of business methods from 1934, to-
gether with improvement in conditions
generally, led to rapid improvement in
the co.’s finances ; reserves have gone to
their present strength from a net deficit of
£52,093 11 years 1 ago.
Since 1945 the value of freeholds has
been doubled by purchases of a Wol-
longong property and a second Sydney
warehouse near the co.’s headquarters in
Clarence-street. Balance-sheet figures
suggest a corresponding increase in busi-
ness turnover: —•

Last term liabilities rose by £103,998 to
help meet increases in fixed assets
(£13,327), stocks (£74,996) and debtors’
balances (£60,800).
The “strong demand” for electrical and
other lines enjoyed last year seems likely
to continue in the current term. The pref.
capital is well backed by tangible assets
—l32s. for each first and 2285. for each
second pref.—and their maximum divs.
call for a total of only £3741. Though
the board hasn’t availed itself since 1938
of the 22? p.c. statutory cut in pref. divi-
dends (the rate of ord. payments has
precluded this), it habitually declares two
rates for the first prefs.—the statutory
6.9 p.c., plus a supplementary 2.1 p.c.
At the present price of 375. these shares
yield 4.9 p.c. No dissection is made of
the div. for the second prefs., which yield
4.6 p.c. at the current quote of 30s. each.

Gold Subsidy
The fixed price of gold
against a background of de-
preciating paper money, which
means rising prices, remains the
subject of urgent pleas by gold-
producers the world over.
Anxious in most instances to get
as much of the yellow metal as
possible, Governments are exer-
cised in their minds as to how
this can be done. Until infla-
tion has run its course it is diffi-
cult, if not impossible, to cut, or
even check, costs. What, then,
can be done to ease outgoings,
or to increase mine revenue for
gold-producers?
Abolition of the special
Federal war-time tax on gold—
half the difference between £A9
and the official price of
£AIO 15s. 3d. a fine ounce —was
a step in the right direction, but
it failed to solve the problem.
The rise in costs since abolition
of the tax has gobbled most, or
all, of the gain, and more besides
in some cases. Also, prospectors
were exempt from the tax on the
first 25 ounces of gold won each
year, and mineowners whose
profit was less than 30s. an
ounce could, and did, get a re-
bate of the tax to bring their
profit to that figure where pos-
sible. Thus the tax didn’t touch
some producers; at all. It is
obvious that reducing taxation
will not save producers making
little or no profit, nor will it do
anything worth mentioning to
prevent shortening the life of
other producers who have been
forced to reassess ore reserves
and eliminate hitherto marginal-
grade stuff.
That leaves us with the second
alternative. And here the prob-
lem is how to overcome the
stated policy of the International
Monetary Fund. Canada got
round it by a complicated
formula based on subsidising
costs. More recently Southern
Rhodesia sailed in with a
straightout raising of the price
of gold to its producers from
1725. 6d. to £lO (stg.) a fine
ounce, and even more in special
cases. Since the colony is not a
direct member of the. Fund, the
manager of thb Fund (Camille
Gutt) has taken up the question
with the U.K. Government;
and there it stands for the
moment.
Australian gold production
for the first half of 1948 was
398,241 fine ounces, or 37,364
fine ounces (nearly 9 p.c.) less
than for the corresponding half
of 1947. If this drift and its
effects upon the Australian
economy generally are to be
arrested —and it is most desir-
able that they should —then it is
up to the Federal Government
to devise ways and means, simi-
lar to those adopted by Canada
if necessary, of temporarily
assisting producers, especially of
marginal-grade ore, to overcome
the problem of rising costs until
such time as the world price of
gold might be brought more
into line, or until a deflationary
movement* brings costs more
into line with the current world
price of gold.
Western Mining Corp., Ltd.,
has formed a new subsidiary,
Great Western Consolidated,
N.L., to take over leases pegged
or under option to the Corp. in
the Yilgarn district, north of
Southern Cross (W.A.) 4 Capital
is £250,000 in ss. shares, all
taken by the parent co., which
has been carrying out prospect-
ing and development work in
the area for the last couple of
years, and has proved sufficient
ore to justify erection of a
30,000-ton-a-month treatment
plant. The most promising
shows tested by the Corp. in
this area are the Copperhead,
Pilot, Three-Boys and Manx-

"Present Laughter."
In this latest effort of Noel
Coward, at Melbourne Princess,
nobody says anything that might
be said in real life except twice
—once when a parlor decoration
was accidentally knocked over
on the first night and Peter
Gray, an excellent and seasoned
actor, remarked impromptu
“There are mice about,” and
once when one of the characters
says “I feel as if I’m acting in
a farce and I’m sick of it.”
The play concerns an actor ap-
proaching middle age who is in-
variably followed home after a
performance by one or other of
his feminine adorers who, hav-
ing lost her latchkey, has to
spend the night in his apart-
ments, to be found there in the
morning by his wife, who is
separated from him. In the
course of the four scenes he col-
lects quite a number of them
and they all decide to accom-
pany him on a tour to Africa.
Having made hay of the con-
ventions for 90 minutes to every-
body’s satisfaction, Mr. ‘Coward
sends the actor back to his wife,
leaving a trail of broken hearts
behind him. He does this with
his usual deftness and theatrical
shrewdness, though a tendency to
longwinded explanations of
nothing in particular appears to
grow upon him. Peter Gray
wears a large range of dressing-
gowns and makes his points with
great adroitness, and Margaret
Reid makes him a good wife.
Daphne Reid, Mari Tomisetti
and Madi Hedd are the various
inamoratas, and Philip Edgley
turns in a psychopathic portrait
which, in any other environment,
would be tragic.
"La Malade
Imaginaire."
The Oliviers having moved,
Sydney is back to normal as far
as the theatre is concerned —
musicomedy at the Royal and
vaudeville at the Tivoli, while
the Minerva at the Cross has
just put on “Love From a
Stranger.” Culture, as usual, is
mainly in the suburbs or the
little theatres —Doris Fitton’s
Independents have just replaced
O’Neill’s “Mourning Becomes
Electra” with Capek’s “R.U.R.” ;
the Sydney University Dramatic
Society is presenting Shak-
speare’s “Pericles” and Coctdau’s
“Orphee” at the Conservatorium
next Saturday night, while the
Kuringai Theatre Guild pre-
sented the Mercury Players in
Moliere’s “La Malade Imagin-
aire” at the Killara Hall last
week.
The Moliere play was pre-
ceded by two other one-acters:
“Memoirs,” by Phillip Johnson,
an inconsequential snippet as
obvious as a train coming round
the bend, and “Midsummer
Night,” by Lajos Biro, a de-
lightful Hungarian trifle about
a count who finances a penniless
actor and takes his wife at the
same time, justifying his actions
with some highly amusing argu-
ment. O. D. Bisset made a
poised and polished count and
delivered his logic with devastat-
ing precision.
Malade Imaginaire” had
Peter Finch as the pill-swallow-
ing, irascible hypochondriac who
is only cured of his imaginary
ailments by being made a doctor,
or, at least, as much a doctor as
are those who prescribe for him.
Finch’s performance was excel-
lent —the kind of study in voice,
gesture and pose that is worth
going miles to see. The rest of
the cast set the comedy off per-
fectly—June Wimble as the
sharp-tongued and sharp-witted
servant; Elsie Dayne as the in-
valid’s wife waiting eagerly for
him to die ; and Patricia Harri-
son as the daughter, with Allan
Ashbolt as the oaf she is sup-
posed to marry, and John
Faassen as the man she wants.
Dr. Raoul Cardamatis.
“I want to produce ‘Peer
Gynt’ in conjunction with the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra,”
said Dr. Raoul Cardamatis
as he abandoned the dissec-
tion of a filet mignon to
chant Grieg’s lovely music
and to illustrate his pro-
posed settings with the aid
of cutlery, crockery and a
pair of very expressive
hands. He went on to a de-
tailed analysis of the Old
Vic, Company’s presenta-
tion of Shakspeare, Sheri-
dan and Wilder, paused to
explain the mathematical
method of arriving at the
Golden Mean, and then
launched into rapturous remi-
niscences of a ballet in London
before the Great War with a
company of 400 dancers, an
orchestra of 250 and an audi-
ence which included half the
crowned heads and nobility of
Europe and England. From
which it may be gathered that
the Doctor has a slight interest
in the theatre.
Born in Athens and educated
at Berlin, Munich and other
university cities, Cardamatis
studied medicine and philosophy,
but couldn’t keep away from
the stage. His mother took him,
“squeaking and crying at the
age of seven,” to Bayreuth to
listen to “Parsifal” and pro-
mised, “I’ll take you as often as
I can until you’ll beg me to go
back again.” The seeds were so
well sown that he wagged uni-
versity and spent hours, some-
times days, at rehearsals watch-
ing Max Reinhardt (the greatest
disciplinarian of them all), Mein-
ert, Bernauer, Lichnowski and
others.
Cardamatis graduated in
medicine and was almost for-
cibly dragged away from the
stage to follow the profession of
his father —a professor specialis-
ing in malarial research at the
University of Athens. In 1924
he came to Australia, still with
PRODUCER.
a raging interest in the theatre
——“many people disheartened
me by underestimating the
artistic intelligence and desire
for art of the Australian public,
but with the help of several in-
tellectual citizens I formed the
Impressionist Theatre.” The
society* immediately set a fine
standard, presenting such plays
as Hauptmann’s “Hannele,”
Rostand’s “Cyrano de Bergerac,”
Wilde’s “Salome,” “The Tem-
pest,” “Death Takes a Holiday”
and others.
About two years ago Carda-
matis wanted to produce Strind-
berg’s incredibly difficult “Dream
Play” at the Minerva, but the
directors of that theatre rated
it a non-commercial play. Doris
Fitton was game enough for the
experiment at her Independent
Theatre, and after five months’
rehearsal Cardamatis produced
it with remarkable success. He
followed with Schiller’s “Maria
Stuart,” with Doris Fitton as
Elizabeth and Jean Robertson as
Mary, and then with “Night
Must Fall” —“produced from a
new psychological angle because
production should never be imi-
tative ; always creative; always
a personal interpretation.”
Cardamatis speaks, in addi-
tion to Greek, Latin, German
and French, has an abiding inter-
est in literature, music, art (he
once tried unsuccessfully to buy a
Norman Lindsay from the late
Howard Hinton and could not
understand how anyone could
want the painting more than he
did) and, of course, the theatre
and all that it implies—history,
architecture, costumes and set-
tings, as well as lighting and the
mechanics, mathematics and
economics of stage.
"La Boheme."
“La Boheme,” probably the
most popular opera ever written,
is a story withbut any compli-
cated problems. Nobody knew
better than Puccini how to ex-
tract the last drop of pathos out
of a situation, and he traces the
progress of the little embroidery-
worker through the various
stages of consumption with such
a sure hand that even half-ton
prima donnas have failed to
wreck it.
Rina Malatrasi is a beautiful
young woman with an expressive
and sensitive soprano, and there
is an appealing naturalness about
her acting. In the current pro-
duction at Melbourne His
Majesty’s, she makes as deep an
impression with the demise of
Mimi as she did with Butterfly’s
self-immolation. Alvino Misci-
ano nourishes the frozen hand
of Mimi with a tenor warm
enough to melt an ice-pack.
The Italian baritones and
bassos are fair representatives of
the Latin Quarter of Paris,
though their carefree gaiety in
their garret suggests a class for
semaphore - signallers working
under the direction of the ser-
geant-major.
"The Barber of
Seville."
Italian producers seem to have
been doing to Rossini’s opera
what generations of producers
have done to the comedies of
Shakspeare —adding more and
more comic business to the
original construction until it
is in danger of disappearing

RED MILL RUM.
In the knowledge that the next few
months’ racing will provide but
limited opportunities for the poorer-
class performers, owners of such
rushed the six-furlongs Ashbury
Mixed Stakes at Canterbury on Satur-
day ; the event required three divisions
and resulted in a card of nine races,
giving punters more scope for doing
their dough than they’ve had for some
years. With an attendance of 28,500,
tote turnover was £115,274; at the
same meeting four years ago a turn-
over of £62,078 set what was then a
record for the course.
Only one horse, Mooreland, has
won the Canterbury Guineas and gone
on to take the Derby—a fact of no
great significance, for many owners
of likely Derby prospects prefer to
reserve their colts for the more
spacious going of Rosehill and Rand-
wick. However, Saturday’s Guineas
winner Riptide should go very close
to bringing off the double, despite that
some of his toughest Derby opponents,
including Ungar, gave the Guineas a
miss.
Riptide was ridden by young
apprentice R. Coles, who had instruc-
tions to try to settle in behind a
pacemaker; however, the Midstream
colt had ideas of his own and wisely
the lad gave him his head. Setting
a cracking pace he completely dis-
organised any plans others may have
had and was, at times, six or eight
lengths clear. With Coles just sitting
his mount in the straight, and con-
tinually looking back over his shoul-
der, which earned him a reprimand
from the stewards, Riptide was run
to a neck by Royal Andrew at the
finish, Dynamite, lengths further back,
being third.
Royal Andrew has a remarkably
good finishing run which will assure
him Derby support, but it is sig-
nificant that, while he was able to pass
Riptide at the finish of the seven-
furlongs Hobartville Stakes, he was
unable to do so at the end of nine
furlongs in the Guineas. Riptide ran
the nine furlongs in 1.55 i, a fraction
better than recorded by the very con-
sistent Hava Chat (E. Fordyce) in
winning the Canterbury Park Handi-
cap from Haymarket and Golden
Plumes.
Jockey W. Cook gave his thick -
and-thin followers a rare good day
at Canterbury by landing four win-
ners; the first. Slander, was an odds-
on favorite for the first Ashbury
Mixed but the others were at respec-
table odds.
Punters, other than the said fol-
lowers of Cook, came a most reson-
ant thud over Deep Sea in the Can-
terbury Stakes (w.f.a. with allow-
ances). Deep Sea looked “pitched
into this six-furlongs affair, receiving
a 141 b. allowance to carry only Bst.,
and drawn No. 1 at the barrier. He
made all the running but showed not
a trace of heart when challenged near
the finish by that evergreen sprinter
Gay Monarch, who, despite the
presence of Cook in the saddle, started
at 33 to 1. In the face of such a
poor exhibition oVer six furlongs it
would look a sheer waste of money
to start Deep Sea in the Epsom.
Another early Epsom “favorite” in
Heroic Sovereign ran poorly to finish
fourth behind Earl Pentheus.
The Three- and Four-year-old
Handicap for fillies and mares gave
Wattle, another for Cook, a chance
to re-establish her class after a couple
of unsuccessful clashes with the crack
colts. She carried 9.3 and, finishing
on strongly from the furlong mark,
won by lengths from Tartan Girl and
lolanda. Grey Nurse and Nell
Gwynne were all the rage for the race,
Wattle starting at the excellent odds
of 4 to 1.
Stewards recently declared war on
barrier rogues, and the first casualty,
unhappily for his connections, was
Columnist’s promising three-year-old
brother Journalist (J. Thompson). The
colt started a warm favorite for the
third Ashbury Mixed and landed the
cash, but he made such a rodeo of
the start that he was declared banned
until his manners can be shown to
have improved. Others of the present
excellent crop of three-year-olds filled
the places in that race, Amar being
second and Uranus third. Yet
another pair of them. Gay Spark
(W. Briscoe) and Leonardo, fought
out; the finish of the second Ashbury.
Gay Spark won narrowly, but
Leonardo, a Double Remove dolt
hailing from W.A., was most im-
pressive. The Campsie Mixed (Ilf.)
went to High Ideals (R. Pearse) and
the Welter to Blue Tulip (W. Cook).

Though fine, the weather was un-
pleasantly cold at Caulfield on Satur-
day, but punters were to find the
elements not half so bitter as equine
ingratitude. The net result of seven
races was seven beaten favorites.
Main event and first w.f.a. race
of the season was the Memsie Stakes
(9f.), a race regarding which trainer
Jack Holt has had extraordinary suc-
cess. Commencing with Eurythmic
in 1920, Holt has saddled up no fewer
than 11 Memsie winners and seemed
likely to make it a round dozen on
Saturday, being represented by
Chanak, odds-on favorite in a small
field.
Most of the way Chanak did look
the likely winner, trailing along.' be-
hind the hard-pulling pacemaker,
Phoibos, and moving up to take the
lead as they entered the straight,
but at the same time, further back
in“'the field, Lungi (J. Purtell) was
initiating a paralysing run for
which the- others had no answer;
Vantage, too, passed a disappointing
“Fair go, Chislehurst! Let me have a pot”
Chanak. Lungi actually looked well
above himself, as one would expect
of a Melbourne Cup candidate at
this stage of his preparation.
The Memsie Stakes was worth
£2OOO, and, with the club adding an
extra £lOOO to the divided Heatherlie
Handicap, all other races carried
£lOOO prizemoney, making the meet-
ing the richest, ever held at Caulfield
other than on aiCup day. Winners
of divisions of the Heatherlie were
Perm (W. Williamson) downing
Tamerlane and Dureisani, and Blank
Music (T. Unkovich) pipping Millais
and favorite Hororata. The distance
of the Heatherlie was nine furlongs,
and both winners are likely to be
given a chance in the Caulfield Cup.
Another to arouse visions of Cups
arid the like in his owner’s mind was
the five-year-old Robin Goodfellow
gelding Lucky Robin (Sam Martin)
winning the Doona Handicap over the
Caulfield Cup 12-furlongs course. He
defeated Chilperic and Ballerdale like
a real stayer, but unfortunately is not
a 100-per-cent, sound animal and
failed to stand up to a Cup prepara-
tion last year.
Although his recent record as a
sprinter has been excellent Gilwell
(R. Cann) was well out in the betting
for the Whittier Handicap (6f.), which
he won at 12 to 1. Assam was favorite,
but the job of lumping 9.5 in heavy-
ish going left him with little sting in
his finish and he managed only third
place behind Gilwell and Sentiment.
Other Caulfield winners were Siren
Song (E. Clarke), calling the tune in
the Glen Eira Handicap for three-
year-old fillies, and Sun Blast (W. A.
Smith), in the Warriston Handicap for
three-year-old colts and geldings, put-
ting the kibosh on Derby hopes enter-
tained by connections of High Tar.

In the Davis Cup challenge round
v. U.S.A., Australia lost the .first
two singles, Parker beating Sidwell
and Schroeder tossing Quist. Only
one team had ever won the Cup after
losing the first two matches, and the
Yanks clinched the issue by as easily
taking the doubles.
* * * *
Norman von Nida, still more or
less convalescent from a nasty
operation, won the Lotus tourney in
England, bringing his tour winnings
to £2OOO. The Von will not be home
for the Australian Open, which is
rather a pity, since a meeting featur-
ing him, Pickworth, Cremin and one
or two others would be worth fol-
lowing. On his form Alan Waterson,
who held his N.S.W. amateur
championship against stiff competition
•last week, could worry the pros, in
the Open.
* * * *
With the tour all but finished, the
Australian cricketers maintained their
undefeated run last week. At Taun-
ton they fairly slaughtered Somerset
by an innings and 374; then headed
down to Hastings for the picnic match
v. South of England. In the best
tradition of picnics, rain spoiled things,
but much fun was had by all. Ere
the match ended (in a draw) such un-
known quantities as Bill Brown and
Harvey were seen not only bowling
but taking wickets! Brown further
distinguished himself by sporting an
umbrella while fielding on the boun-
dary during a shower.
* * * *
“Long-Leg”: Glamorgan stirred the
cricket limelight before its win m
this year’s English champion-
ship (B. 1 /9/’4B). In 1946, in a craze
for something “atomic,” Welsh cap-
tain Clay brought censure about his
ears from Lord’s for a “freak
declaration” at Pontypridd. On a
saturated ground Somerset declared
at 51 for one wicket qnd Glam, also
closed at 51 for one (a tie would
then be a possibility); in their second
innings Somerset collapsed for 53
and Glamorgan got the necessary 54
for two wickets. Nothing else like
this audacity appears in musty cricket
records, hence the buzz by top-hat
officialdom. It certainly nailed the
Leek to the flagpole in a thrilling
challenge.
* * * *
Essendon finished minor premiers
in the V.F.L. in a sort of practice
run against Fitzroy on Saturday,
10.11-7.11, and with Richmond
downed by Carlton, 9.21-9.16, in a
“photo, finish,” Footscray scraped
into “the four” with an easy win
over North Melbourne, 18.21-11.10.
Next Saturday the improving Foots-
cray will meet the somewhat jaded
Collingwood, beaten 13.11-8.11 on
Saturday by Melbourne, in the first
semi-final. Essendon earned its place
on top by steady football during the
season, going through the exploded
Fitzroy and battling Collingwood to
head the list. The Dons’ most serious
rival for the premiership appears to
be Melbourne. In the lesser games
on Saturday “Sowth” trounced Gee-
long, 21.16-6.9, though a few weeks
ago Geelong looked like a “final-
four” side, and St. Kilda actually
won another game, this time against
Hawthorn, 9.13-7.12.

In a wild and woolly Rugby Union
final, which crammed 12,000 spec-
tators into North Sydney Oval, Manly
beat Gordon 14-9, and will now meet
Rand wick in the grand final.

One thing about the Leichhardt
match between Nipper O’Brien (9.2)
and Jackie Wilson (9.2) was that it
did serve to show how little the
majority of boxing fans evidently
know about the game. The present
writer, for instance, and, judging from
their expressed disapproval, at least
90 per cent, of the crowd, had a
definite impression that O’Brien had
won rather easily, but the ref., crown-
ing Wilson, enlightened us all con-
siderably.

Mr. Chifley’s “Generosity”
Mr. Chifley, who collected
£233 million last year in income
tax —which was £25 million
greater than the previous year’s
levy, in spite of “concessions”
—has agreed to income-tax re-
ductions for the current year
which are estimated to “cost” the
Treasury £29 million a year.
The “concessions” will amount
to a reduction in tax-levies rang-
ing from 33 p.c. in some lower-
income scales to as little as 3
p.c. in higher groupings. It is
doubtful, however, whether Mr.
Chifley will collect any less
from the people as a whole than
he did in 1947-48. The
“national income” is inflating at
a fast rate, largely because of
the rising cost of living and the
falling value of money, but
partly because of the high ex-
port prices received for our land
production. Mr. Chifley has
given tax relief to consumers
rather than investors and pro-
ducers, which tends to create
greater inflation. His taxation
rake-off from the people will be
maintained by the inflation in
monetary incomes.
With the abandonment of
price-control by Canberra a
number of subsidies on food
and clothing are also being
dropped. This will mean a sharp
rise in the cost of living, calling
for a lift in the basic wage by
an amount variously estimated.
The Federal Budget will be re-
lieved of the need to provide
subsidies to an extent that might
easily offset the taxation con-
cessions now proposed. In
other words, the tax-cuts now
publicised as a kind of Can-
berra bounty to the people will,
on balance, cost the Treasury
little or nothing, and the people
will be nothing in pocket as’ a
result.
But Canberra is using its
crippling taxation exactions to
the best political advantage on
the expenditure side. Child en-
dowment is to go up 2s. 6d. a
week (to 10s. for each endowed
child), estimated cost £7 million
a year ; widows’, invalid and
old-age pensions rise by ss. a
week ; there is' to be “liberalisa-
tion” of means test to permit
pensioners to earn as much as
30s. a week each without reduc-
tion in pension; and property
qualification rises from £650 to
£750 (excluding dwelling). Mr.
Chifley commented, in disclosing
his tax and pension proposals,
that the cost of social services
had already passed £7O million
a year, compared with a pre-war
figure of £2O million; and the
cost, he said, would continue to
increase. This, taken in con-
junction with the Government’s
trade-union policy and its infla-
tion of the Federal public ser-
vice, gives full support to the
assertion made in these pages
early in the reign ot the first
Curtin Government and recently
reiterated by Mr. Fadden: that
the Government would like to
see everyone a trade-unionist, a
pensioner or a civil servant. It
would then be in a position to
exercise political bribery of the
electorate to the full.
With “concessions” of indirect
taxes totalling £lO million, Mr.
Chifley estimates that the total
cost of his election-year vote-
chasing will amount to £6O mil-
lion. Against this, of course,
will be the saving in the cost of
subsidies now being abandoned
and the bigger national-income
“turnover” from which the
lower tax rates will take their
rake-off.
In 1947-48, in income tax
alone, Mr. Chifley’s Govern-
ment collected 16 times as much
as in the last pre-war year. That
was after handing back to the
State Governments £45 million
as tax refunds. Taking Com-
monwealth taxation of all kinds,
the 1947-48 haul by Canberra
“Labor” was five times a&’ great
as the 1938-39 collection. Mr.
Chifley last year collected £3BB
million in taxes, after allowing
rebates to the States, whereas
the comparative figure in
1938-39 was £77 million.
The Federal civil service now
exceeds 166,000 persons, against
60,000 before the war. Last
year’s administrative: expendi-
ture in departments' took a leap
of £11.3 million, rising to £26.8
million. Gross political abuse
of the public purse and a
socialistic “full - employment”
policy have been evident in
“ Thanks, Judge. How about bavin a ticket in the lottery
with me ?"
“Labor’s” public accounts for
years past, and they are getting
worse with the passing of time
and the swinging of public
opinion against the Govern-
ment.
The main tragedy of Canberra
“Labor’s” politico - economic
policy is that such enormous
financial power, resting in its
hands by reason of the continu-
ance of high wpr-time rates of
taxation, is being used in a way
that promotes two of the other
major evils in our midst —under-
production in industry and in-
flation. Canberra “Labor” is so
wedded to its socialistic policy,
and so intent upon buying its
way back to office by the redis-
tribution of personal incomes in
a way that encourages the loafer
and penalises the producer, that
it cares little about the national
effects of its behavior. Private
enterprise has lost much of its
financial initiative and its power
to discipline industrial law-
breakers as a direct result of
“Labor” policy.
Mt. Eba
Those people, especially
women, who cannot afford to
lose the money invested had
better get out of Mt. Eba Gold
shares while the going is good.
At 14s. 3d, for the 2s. 6d. shares
the scrip has reached a remark-
ably high price, and, unless a
great deal more payable ore
is blocked-out by the manage-
ment, or unless a heavenly
meteorite thickly impregnated
with gold happens to fall (and
not bury itself too deeply)
within the boundaries of the
co.’s leases, there will be noth-
ing like the £140,000 profit defi-
nitely in sight which is needed to
justify the 14s. 3d. a share being
paid in the sharemarket. The
prospectus of Mt. Eba Gold dis-
closed that in the 40 years be-
tween 1898 and 1938 various
mining operations had resulted
in 821 tons of ore from Mt. Eba
district being milled or smelted
for 375 fine ounces of gold—
worth, at today’s price, a total
of around £4OOO.
Butter Contract
Australia has negotiated a
seven - year agreement with
Britain for the sale of butter-
and cheese similar to that con-
cluded with New Zealand (B.
25 / 8/’4B). Australia’s price for
butter during the 1948-49 sea-
son will be 2335. 6d. sterling a
hundredweight, f.0.b., which is
Is. 6d. lower than the Maoriland
price. Cheese is being sold at
131 s. 6d. sterling a hundred-
weight (2s. below MX.) Prices
under both Australian and N-Z.
contracts were 30s. higher for
butter and 15s. higher for cheese
than for 1947-48.
As with the Maoriland con-
tract, the Australian agreement
provides for a review of prices,
not exceeding 1\ p.c. of the pre-
ceding year’s rate, upon either
party submitting , substantial
grounds.
. Australian butter - producers
have been guaranteed 2s. a
pound in Australian money, sub-
ject to any movements in pro-
duction costs, for five years.
Any net excess received from
export butter will be paid into
an equalisation fund to stabilise
returns from export. Maoriland
has been building up a stabilisa-
tion fund for several years, and
last year 265. sterling a hundred-
weight went into the pool.
If the Australian pound re-
turned to sterling parity it looks
as though the problem of keep-
ing the home-consumption price
of butter down to its present
level would be greatly increased.
The Australian £
It was announced “authori-
tatively” in Canberra last week
that there would be no change
in the Australian exchange rate
on London so long as sterling
remained pegged at its present
rate with the U.S. dollar.
At the Premiers’ Conference,
in private session, Prime Minis-
ter Chifley told the Premiers
that he had given an assurance
to the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, Sir Stafford Cripps,
that so long *s sterling remained
at $4.03 to the £, the Australian
rate with sterling would remain
steady.
In all the known circum-
stances, it seems a decision to
which little exception should be
taken. Certainly no “disinfla-
tion” should be attempted by
appreciating sterling unless other
effective efforts are employed to
increase production and reduce
costs. And the sooner Can-
berra’s intentions in the matter
of the exchange rate were made
known the better for the
stability of business.
The wool sales opened with
prices at higher levels last week.
There was a quick kick-back
on the trade front when the rise
in New Zealand’s pound stripped
exporters of Australian orders
for crockery, timber, wood pro-
ducts, tinned cheese and other
lines, running well into six
figures. It was a heavy blow to
Maoriland’s young crockery in-
dustry, just getting on its feet,
with Australia prepared to take
half the output. Amalgamated
Brick and Pipe Co., a subsidiary
of Consolidated Brick Invest-
ments, Ltd., Auckland, gave
notice of dismissal to 75 of its
crockery-manufacturing staff the
week after the exchange was
forced down, and retrenchment
might have to go further, as the
staff is still over 350. Timber-
exporters who had the ground
cut from under their feet in-
cluded a co. which sent 24 mil-
lion ice-cream spoons and 25,000
dozen pencil-cases to Australia
in the past four years. Shippers
of pine were others who saw
their trade vanish. Fish-ex-
porters, who need the Australian
outlet in the flush of the sea-
son, will be in trouble a few
months hence, and tomato-
growers aren’t happy about the
outlook for canned tomatoes.
These are the vanguard of
Maorilanders who bemoan
Labor’s Budget brainwave.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY.
(Airmail from Auckland .)
The “New Look” £NZ
Many traders and producers
in New Zealand don’t know
whether to chalk up August 20
as a new dawn or Black Friday,
and they’re far from happy
about the state of things under
their New Look pound. Maybe
time will heal their wounds, but
they feel pretty sore just now.
Somebody will gain millions out
of the big move, but producers
are sure it won’t be them, for
export income is down with a
thud and there might be a cut of
£l2 million or more for the four
months ending December.
For a full year the drop might
be £3O million. One-third of
this might fall on wool and two-
thirds on butter, cheese and
meat, which are backed by pro-
ducers’ pooled funds of close on
£4O million. There’s enough in
the pools to keep returns round
ruling levels for a couple of
seasons, then they would be
empty. No business-head would
drain away his reserves in good
times, and Maoriland producers
might take the long view when it
comes to figuring-out whether
they should eat their cake now
oi keep it until they’re hungry.
Woolgrowers, who have £7
million to fall back on —if the
Government will let them touch
wool-levy proceeds and profits
from war-time stocks—will have
tc do some hard thinking, too.
Before they get down to cal-
culating their loss, producers will
have to reckon Jiow much they’ll
save through lower prices for
tractors, farm machinery and
other imports. They might find
half the gap of £3O million
bridged; but high taxes will be
sand in the works after that.
Farmers will be more tax-
conscious than ever as they feel
their pockets hit, or see pool
funds threatened, by Labor’s
moves to help the towns at the
expense of the country. Those
.pools, which looked big a few
weeks ago, seem to have shrunk,
though the rise in the pound has
made them worth more; so
Maoriland farmers are hoping
for a few more years of good
export prices to help them re-
cover from the blow,
But the outstanding leader in
the N.Z. dairy industry, William
Goodfellow, sees a danger. This
is what he says: “For the first
time in the history of New Zea-
land the value of sterling in
world markets is open to ques-
tion, yet we must sell our pro-
duce in sterling. If the U.K.
gets into financial difficulties in
the next year or so, sterling will
have to be devalued in terms of
the dollar.” Goodfellow warns
that New Zealand’s seven-year
contract for meat and butter
with John Bull will be good only
so long as sterling holds its
ground. If sterling slipped, New
Zealand would get a shock.
Traders are worried about
stocks they’ll have to unload be-
fore a “deadline” date, not yet
announced, if they are to escape
loss. Ex-president Bill Truscott,
of the Manufacturers’ Federa-
tion, condemns the deadline and
predicts it will bring trouble ;
but New Zealand’s Government,
which still wants to control
everything, seems determined to
go ahead. Where Governments
generally have had enough sense
to get out of the way and let
competition have a free run dur-
ing falling prices, New Zealand
leaders have the harebrained
idea that prices can, and should,
be driven downhill.
Right now merchants and re-
tailers are getting busy pushing
sales, while the public is in-
clined to sit back. Goods that
have been under the counter for
years are out on show, and
blackmarketeers are having a
lean time. Shopping is easier
than New Zealanders have
known for years. But there
won’t be a deluge of imports
flowing in as shelves are
emptied, for Finance Minister
Walter Nash is holding a tight
rein on import permits.
On the sharemarkets the jump
in the pound knocked most in-
vestors flat on their backs, where
they remained in a dazed condi-
tion for days. Then a few bolder
spirits took their courage in both
hands and began to look around
for bargains. Strange as it may
seem, they didn’t find many.
Sellers had skedaddled for shel-
ter. When the first halting moves
were made to get on to business
terms again MX, securities
hadn’t shifted much from mid-
August levels. Australian cos,
had taken a fairly heavy knock,
with 8.H.P., one of the earliest
Commonwealth leaders to re-
gain the sales list, down 14 per
cent., but this was 6 per cent,
less than the rise in the £NZ.
Buying pressure in MX. is still
strong, though reined-in until
operators get over their fright;
and, as funds are* banked up be-
hind the financial iron curtain,
it shouldn’t be long before busi-
ness gets into its stride again.
Building Activity
Builders in New Zealand are
stepping on it as never before to
turn out more than a thousand
houses a month, and that’s about
as high as they can go with
materials and workers now in
sight, according to knight James
Fletcher, Maoriland’s big man
in building and construction —
he was Commissioner of
Works in the war years. “It's
a wonderful record,” he says,
with a strong Scotch accent; his
combine (Fletcher Holdings,
Ltd., and subsidiaries) has been
putting its weight behind the
►post-war housing drive. Output
has been lifted by 3000 in the
latest year to today’s peak of
13,000 houses, and compares
with 7500 in, 1939 and 2000-odd
in bedrock mid-war years.
If the pace is held for an-
other three or four years, N.Z,
shouldn’t have any major hous-
ing worries left, but there is a
big pent-up demand for busi-
ness, office, factory and State-
department space due to the
present standstill while homes
have the field to themselves.
“Shortage of office accommoda-
tion and schools, to take only
two examples of other types of
construction, is as acute as the
housing shor t a g e,” says
Fletcher. For eight years
planners of office buildings have
been waiting for permits outside
a barred and bolted door, and
when they get the signal to go
three more years will slip by
before any full-sized office block
is ready to ease M.L.’s space
worries. One block started now
in each of M.L.’s four main
centres would be a godsend
round 1951,*and wouldn’t throw
the housing effort out of gear.
Main bottlenecks on the build-
ing front are steel and roofing,
and there is no sign of any early
pick-up in supplies from Aus-
tralia or Britain to help Maori-
land out of trouble. Galvanised-
iron is scarcer than in leanest
war years.
The Dominion’s young
asbestos industry could fill a big
gap if it could get properly into
its stride, but output is governed
by imports of asbestos-cement
fibre, with South Africa as the
nearest likely source for extra
shipments. Today M.L.’s two
factory plants are idling along
below one-third capacity on
Canadian asbestos fibre, and
can’t expect more from that
quarter. So knight James
Pitcher is going to talk busi-
ness with South African asbes-
tos-fibre producers. If South
Africa is interested, permanent
new trade will open up, for N.Z.
is ready to make all its own cor-
rugated and other asbestos sheet-
ing for a market that’s a good
deal wider than before the war.


ABORIGINALITIES
“E. 2”; Radway, chafing under the con-
stant ties of milking cows, made up his
mind suddenly to sell the farm and get
out to something better in the way of
occupation. “S’pose I’ll have t’ buy an-
other farm somewhere,” he confided to
Dan. “But it won’t be in a dairying
districk like this.” “What about Queens-
land?” asked Dan, nursing a momentary
enthusiasm. “Things are bound t’ go
ahead up there before long.” “Yair,
they might,” Radway said. “But I ain’t
goin’ there.' Y’ remember that Simpson
bloke, the one with the freckles an’ buck-
teeth? He was half-ratty an’ useter git
on me nerves somethin’ chronic. Well,
he went t’ Queensland. I ain’t goin’ near
the place while he’s there.”
* * * *
“Mul”: I had let young Ben from
across the river have a couple of kittens
from Tibby’s latest litter. A few weeks
later, dropping in on my way to the
township to see if he wanted anything, I
asked how the kittens were going.
“They’ve disappeared,” said Ben with a
puzzled look, “and I can’t make out how
they could have got out/ I locked ’em
up in the barn to see if they could keep
the mice down —that old carpet-snake
I’ve had in there for months is getting a
bit lazy on it.”
* * * $
“Mat’s Mate”: We were in a cold
camp on the Waugoola slopes one night,
huddled in our naps while a bitter wind
whooped and howled through the timber.
Away down a valley we could see a
homestead light, and I thought of the
warmth there and said, “Y’ know, I
reckon it’s time a man give up this
knockin’ about an’ got married an’ settled
down. Must be pretty decent t’ sit in
front o’ the fire an’ know that y’ can
go an’ get into a warm bunk when y’
feel like it an’ shove your back against
the missps an’ let the flamin’ wind howl
its head off an’ the night outside be as
cold as it ruddy well likes an’ ”
“Aw, shut up!” Mat cut in. “How
would y’ get on in the middle o’ the night
when she woke up an’ reckoned she heard
a burglar or a snake or somethin’ an’
y’ had t’ out an’ chase it? You’re
Get a move on , sister—you re on my corn!”
gettin’ soft, mate. Pull” He let out
a screech, leapt up and started frantically
shaking his blankets. “Bull-ailts,” he
roared. Next instant I was up, too, and
in no time we’d shaken out the nap,
rolled it and we’re heading through the
night for safer parts. “See what I
mean?” I said. “Don’t be silly,” he re-
plied. “We’ll make Cowra in a couple
o’ hours an’ get stuck into some hot
rum. How would y’ look draggin’ a
missus instead of a mate into a pub
howlin’ for rum?” It was too much for
me.
* t * * *
“The Pirate”; Few sportsmen’s para-
dises are better than lonely Night Island,
inside the Barrier between Cooktown and
Thursday Island. In the late spring the
white-plumaged Torres Strait pigeons
migrate to the narrow, mile-long, tree-
clad isle to breed, and they are so thick
that a steamer’s whistle sends them rising
up above the tree-tops like a snow-white
cloud. At anchor between the island
and the main all you do to get fresh
poultry is to take a gun on deck in the
late afternoon. At daylight the pigeons
leave to feed on the island ranges, and
they return towards dark in small flocks.
The only art is to shoot to drop the
quarry on deck. Ashore in the island’s
mangroves—except for a strip of sand
there’s no land —the pigeons’ nests of
sticks are everywhere in thousands.
Underneath those nests the cooing sounds
like one continuous noise, and amid the
fluttering, fighting and squawking of those
myriads of birds one has only one thought
—to get to blazes out of it!
* * * *
“Bardie”; “Some dawgs are nearly
human,” remarked old Harry, nodding
to where the platelicker dreamed of rab-
bits on the bag before the fire. I cast
an eye over the hound, his breeding
visible from nose to stern in the frequency
with which the characteristics of one kind
left off and another took over. “But
surely that mong—er —pet of yours isn’t
one of ’em?” I said. Harry leaped to
the defence. “Too flamin’ right he is!”
he said. “Why, on’y yestiddy Mulligan’s
bull took after him in the big paddick.
An’ what do y’ reckon Soolem did?
Legged it f’r the fence an’ shot through
like a bullet, jist nacher’ly like any sen-
sible human’d do.”
* * * *
“Goldie”; The cove who could swing
a hammer left-handed (B. 11/8/’4B) was
a handy mate underground where boring
was done by hand. Working in a narrow
driye, the underlay often cramped the
swing of a right-hander, whereas the
molly-dooker could use the hammer com-
fortably. And vice versa. The drill-
hammer was usually a six-pounder,
double-faced and tapering to both small
faces. On a 2ft. 6im handle, with good
balance and fall, these hammers are cap-
able of flogging a drill with concentrated
energy and a great deal of precision.
Holes being bored from almost any angle,
they had to be swung from all positions, a
mishit liable to take a sizeable lump of
hide from the hand of the miner turning
the drill. I made the mistake only once
of sympathising with a turner after I’d
clouted him thenceforth on those
occasions I got in first and roared him
up for wobbling the drill. The champion
drill-smiters were those rare individuals
who could swing a hammer powerfully
and accurately from either side, either
hand and any angle you cared to
nominate.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Like “Old-
timer” and his mates (B. 11/8/’4B) I, too,
won’t forget Arumpo station, 60 miles
north of Euston (N.S.W.), where jum-
bucks exist mostly on a diet of gumleaves
and air. Dajarra paddock there enclosed
48 square miles of mallee that wouldn’t
support a blowfly in a good season. In
April, 1933, coming through from Poon-
carie on the so-called stock-route, with
wethers, we negotiated arid mallee scrub
for two days and night-camped on the
Dajarra, Gam Pang, and No-Man’s-Land
boundaries. Then we got a thunderstorm
and inches of rain, after which there was
no sign of the boy who had taken the
horses back 15 miles to water. At dawn
there were still no horses ; so, marooning
the cook, my mate and myself, with dogs,
set off on foot to drive 5000 wethers
across Dajarra. I’ll never forget it. Not
even a bit of copper burr to draw the
mob along, and trudging over white sand-
hills of whipstick. mallee and spinifex
that pricked mighty hard. At midday
the boy caught us up with the horses and
at dark we reached the far fence —a 10-
mile stage. But who’d go droving? We
had no cart, no brake, no tucker or
water. In that flourbag-like sandhill
country the four-horse wagon could make
only a knot and a half, and the infuriated
cook had camped at dark three miles
back. All night we intermittently shep-
herded hungry sheep that wouldn’t camp
and trudged back three miles for tucker.
It was another five miles on to the tank
next day. I disagree with “0.-t.” —I
don’t reckon Arumpo ever was a station!
All I hope they are not putting ex-
servicemen out there.
* * * %
“Betcha”: The mistake most newchums
make when they want to study animals
or birds in their native habitat is to go
looking for them. With foxes, dingoes,
“I do wish you d ask these people not to sit on the tables.”
etc., their noses are the hardest things
to elude, and even on a seemingly calm
day one must watch out for air-drifts
and keep up-wind. Sitting motionless,
even in full view, most animals will eye
one curiously, trying to work out the
unfamiliar object, but, without that tell-
tale whiff, will seldom bolt. Then there’s
the joker that walks all day in rabbit-
infested country looking for a shot. The
chap who picks his possie and sits down
motionless will get ’em the easy way.
Birds, too, are just as simple. It is the
movement that scares them. Squatted
against a bush, I’ve had them brush
against me, and, perching within inches
of my dial, whistle away merrily, all un-
conscious of the spy in their audience.
* * * *
“Zake”; “Old-timer’s” Sleepy Williams
(B. 1/9/’4B) had a* counterpart in the
Draper, so-called because of his habit of
draping himself over the nearest thing
and faffing into vociferous slumber.
Camped out on his own one night in the
Colo Ranges, a bushfire swept out of the
west and engulfed the ancient bell-tent
he’d souvenired from the army. Some-
time during the morning the Draper
rolled over, looked up and his eyes took
on a puzzled look as he surveyed the
slightly blackened, mast-like pole of his
tent —the only Ihing left of his camp.
“Blime! ” he burst out at last. “I must ’a’
bin shanghaied!”
* * * *
“B. A. Ker” :• Bent and broken, as
though exhausted by its toil in burning all
the bricks for the earliest homesteads built
in the district, the old chimney stands by
the wreck of the brick-kiln. But every
morning while the sun’s rays still shine
squarely on the eastern face of the brick-
work its loneliness is broken by the
arrival of a pair of visitors. Sitting on a
broken bear% about 20ft. away the two
kookaburras stare like idol-worshippers at
a point about two-thirds of the way up
the 25ft.-high stack. Suddenly one bird
will launch itself at a 2in. break in the
brickwork. Generally there is a sharp
crack as its beak strikes the edge of an
unyielding brick, and the kooka returns
to its former position. A few seconds’
pause, then the other will shoot off, aim-
ing at a smaller crack 2ft. lower. With
the same technique as its mate the bird is
also able to make its thrust, turn, and
come back, without having to put a claw
on the brickwork. I was interested enough
to borrow a pair of binoculars to find out
exactly what the pair were hunting. The
glasses revealed one of those sun-
worshipping small lizards (or are they
newts?) as it darted out of the larger
fissure. Quick (hough the kookaburra
was, the little creature was quicker as it
sped to safety. Its appearance at the
lower crack was regular enough to in-
dicate that there was not more than one
lizard. But for an hour or so every morn-
ing the game still goes on, each bird
attacking in turn and neither aiming at
the other’s target. So far no triumphant
gurgles have announced success, but a
certain small lizard is playing with fire.
One morning he is going to wander just
a little bit too far from his haven ; then
Jacko will have his laugh—the last one.
“Argumentative Mac”: The most ex-
traordinary raider I’ve had trapped in a
craypot (B. 18/8/’4B) was a seal, which in
1-+fathoms had swum in after the fresh
salmon-trout bait —in those parts, Cape
Schanck (Vic.), a seal’s favored food.
“L.T.”: Not all octopuses find their
way out of craypots. In pre-war
days, when craying with Tup Hackett
about the Margaret Brock Reef near
Cape Jaffa (S.A.), quite a percentage
of pots had large-sized ockos in them and
you knew it. The tentacled brutes spread
themselves like umbrellas, and it was like
hauling up ton-weights instead of 22
fathoms of grass-line. Octopuses, how-
ever, can, when hungry, find their way out
of the fish-traps. But how the 151 b. deep-
sea snapper—blue fellows they were—
manoeuvred their way through the in-
tricate cone funnel to eat these squid-like
fish without getting trapped stiff has me
thinking.
•♦* * *
“Kerin Paul”: The native song-
thrushes have been quiet for months, but
today they came back to frolic in the
naked but budding poplar, their favorite
haunt when it is in leaf. There’s a rusty
tinge on their slate-grey backs, but they’re
as neat as ever. His joyous announce-
ment that the vernal season is here was
ignored by his migrant cousin, the chap
Gerard Manley Hopkins describes as
“strawberry-breasted”—he being freckled
like that fruit. Strawberry merely ruffled
his feathers, dropped his wings a little
lower and continued to stare dismally
out from under the hedge. The Aussie
thrush went on with his harmonious fore-
cast of better days, but it seems you can’t
tell this strawberry chap a thing. > Maybe
he’d rather be in England and wait till
April’s there.
* * * *
“Herbert Dawson”: Does any living
thing possess a less lovable nature than a
bulldog-ant? He and his crossgrained
cobbers generally build their nests at the
foot of a green tree, the mound with its
auger-hole entrance being well camou-
flaged by a clump of blady-grass or wild
sago. Being mostly nocturnal he isn’t
usually working in the garden or out of
doors at all when you arrive with the per-
fectly peaceful intention of “cooling-otf”
for a couple of minutes in the shade.
Resting your axe against the tree-trunk,
you squat on a boot-heel to fill your
pipe or roll a fag. You are for 10 or 12
seconds quite unconscious of the fact that
you have raised the fires of hell in the
breast of as lousy an insect as ever ground
a mandible “with intent.” He doesn’t
bark, or even snarl, to warn you off. He
just bogs in. You feel a red-hot needle
thrust into the calf of your leg. You get
two more in the seat of the pants, just
as you take off with a leap worthy of
judicial notice in the Olympic Games,
and then a series of stabs in the tenderest
of areas indicate that the brute’s brothers
are with him and cause you to “shed
your plumage in mid-flight.” Having
spilt your tobacco, dropped your pipe
somewhere in a jungle of long grass that
by this is seething with murderous red
devils, and left your hat and nearly all
your clothing strewn about the neigh-
borhood, you are in no condition to ap-
preciate the fact that the urge to bung
formic acid into anything that walks,
flies, or crawls on to or near that hidden
nest or that tree is, after all, the primitive
form of patriotism and love of country.
A nark, if ever there was one! But
somewhere between his spirit and that
of the average Australian “wharfie” and
“coalie” might be found the force that
would boot the Commo out of our in-
dustrial life and make the future of White
Australia safe and peaceful. I would
suggest “kicking-off” somewhere in the
bull-ant’s “twenty-five.”
SPRING POEM.
The sweet fervor of spring arrives
With the brown bees storing honey in hives
And the clover-flower glowing white
Like new-world stars in the traveller’s sight.
The starlings build beneath the eaves;
There are hints of coming colors in leaves,
And dogs of the neighborhood catch unawares
Grocer-boys with pencils in their ears.
Grandmother puts off hdtr winter shawl
And hears the peewits’ chorus-call
In the camphor-laurel tree outside.
The children walk and the children ride
To the little school below the hill
Where tugging them on rings the thick-tongued
bell.
I should be glad if someone would say
That I could hurry down for the day.
QUEENSLAND.

DOGS NEED CARE
To keep your dog healthy and fit you
should watch for danger signs that show
when he is out of sorts and needs atten-
tion. If his coat is dull, loose or ragged
if his nose is warm and he is moody,
listless or off his food, he is probably
suffering from digestive disorders that pro-
duce these symptoms. Start giving him

“Old-timer”: At Cohuna I wanted to
find Sam Kitson. His son thought he
would be down at the garage. The
garageman came out from under a heavy
truck, wiped the grease off his hands,
accepted a cigarette and frowned thought-
fully. “This is Sam’s truck,” he said.
“Wait a minute. Did he say he was
goin’t’ Koondrook? No, that was Mon-
day, an’ I seen him on Wednesday, so he
must ha’ come back.” He puffed and
looked up at the sky, then down at the
ground. Sam being neither up nor down,
he continued: “Thursday was the sale
at Elmore, an’ he’d be certain t’ be at
that, an’ this bein’ Friday he wouldn’t
be there now. I got a idea he said some-
thin’ about lookin’ at a secondhand
tractor over Gunbower way—or was
that Harry Knight when I see him in
Barham at the football last Saturday?—
no, it couldn’t ha’ been Harry: he went
t’ Melbourne. Yes, it was Sam, all
right”—becoming slightly excited —“be-
cause I recollect he asked me whether 1
knew the tractor or not, an’ that was just
after we got the phone-call from the
broken-down bloke on the Elmore-road
an’ had to tear out an’ fix him up.
Stuck-up exhaust valve, he had. Had t’
tow him in. Sam was standin’ be the
door when we got back, talkin’ t’ young
Lees, who used t’ work for the bloke who
owns the tractor. That was this mornin’,
1 think.” He stared thoughtfully at the
ground, spat out the cigarette-butt. “Now,
where did Sam say he was goin’
after?” “It doesn’t matter,” I said.
“I can see Sam in your garage there,
talkin’ to a mechanic.”

“C.E.”; Mum eyed the old table in
the corner dubiously. “Dad, I’ve been
thinking we’ll sell that table,” she an-
nounced thoughtfully. “The drawers are
both broken through underneath, and we
don’t seem to use it nowadays. What
about taking it over to the Hoppers’
clearing sale?” Dad considered the mat-
ter. “Awright,” he decided. “Might get
a quid for it. Can’t take it like that,
though. Everybody’ll know it’s ours, an’
it’ll give the place a bad name. I’ll fix
it up a bit.” He brought hammer and
nails and mended the broken leg; then,
scouting round for boards, added new
parts to the broken drawers. Mum
fussed happily over the result. She put
things into the drawers for the pleasure
of using them and discovered she could
now leave dishes on the table-top with-
out the rickety leg spilling everything.
During the next couple of days she found
a dozen uses for the old table. “I didn’t
know a solid table there could be so
handy,” she remarked’ at dinner-time.
“Do you know, Dad, I’ve decided we’ll
keep it, after all.” “Gripes, break it
down. Mum,” came the old bloke’s pro-
test. ? ‘Not after all me trouble mending
the thing!”

“Bo”: A log which had slithered a few
feet had pinned Tremain by the leg. He
was on his own except for his dog, which,
after barking worriedly for a while,
bounded off. Five minutes later the tyke
appeared at the Wade homestead. Jim
Wade was sitting on a form in the sun
outside his kitchen door. Beside him was
his full tobacco-pouch, and in his hand
was the newspaper the mailman had left
shortly before. As the dog frisked up
to him and barked Wade looked up, said
“Hullo, boy, what do you want?” and
immediately resumed reading. The dog
kept barking, and in the end Wade, an-
noyed at this heretical interruption to his
solemn midday ritual, shooed the hound
off. After keeping his distance for a few
seconds, his head on one side, Towser
bounded in, snatched the tobacco-pouch
and made off, though stopping to look
back after he had gone a few yards. With
a roar of rage Wade rose and went after
his most precious possession. Satisfied,
the dog loped away. A few minutes later,
with the panting Wade blundering
through the scrub 100 yards or so behind
it. Tremain’s dog stood before his master
wagging his tail furiously. Tremain
reached out weakly and took the pouch
from the dog’s mouth. “Good boy!” he
gasped, “Now scrounge some papers
and then you’d better go for help!”

“Blime”: No doubt “B. A. Ker’s” im-
maturity accounted for the mildness of
that snake - and - metho episode (B.
11/8 / ’4B), Snakes are harder to kill these
days. I’d, been away from the shack
several days, and, returning, found the
place occupied by a jiarge family of
Blakes, Small green blokes they were ;
can’t pame the variety. Deciding there’d
be no peace with them around, I began
mopping ’em up. Broke a lot of belong-
ings in the hit-and-miss attack, but even-
tually mangled a good collection, and
chucked them into a corner, where they
wriggled into a box of bills and private

papers. Had hardly snored off after that*
when a strange rustling woke me, and I
lay in the eerie darkness, sweating under
a premonition of approaching evil.
Breathlessly I listened ; then the old clock
that I’d picked up at a clearing-sale burst
out like a Mills-bomb, and I counted the
strokes —thirteen! With trembling hands
I lit the lantern. Sure enough there they
were, creeping towards me. I turned, but
it was no go; they had me surrounded,
and as I tried to get up those snakes
swarmed over my legs, holding rqe down,
till I couldn’t do a blessed thing. Despair-
ingly I stared around that ring of relent-
less captors, and, believe it or not, every
one of ’em was gripping a pipe and carry-
ing an income-tax assessment. Honest,
it’s enough to make a bloke put himself
under the Dog Act.

“Frank Humphrey”: Charlie leaned
heavily across the windlass, his hang-
over more severe now than earlier in
the morning. “Your turn below, Joe,”
he said, forestalling any plan Joe may
have had to ease his own condition by
remaining on top. Joe grunted and
started down the ladders. At the bot-
tom he lit a candle and, without waiting
for his eyes to accustom themselves to
the gloom, ponderously groped his way
into the face. He had barely started
work when from bfehind him came thuds
and bumps as though someone lurchingly
approached along the drive. “I thought
you weren’t coming down,” said Joe. No
answer. Joe turned slowly round and,
still holding the candle, peered about
him. The wallaby, which apparently had
fallen down, faced him, but its eyes were
unfocused and confused. Joe seized a
pick-handle. “Take your corner,” he
challenged and moved into the attack.
The fight was short and decisive, and
Joe dumped the stunned wallaby into
the bucket. “Haul away!” he roared up
the shaft. The ride revived the wallaby,
which leaped from the bucket as it
reached the top and knocked the wind-
lass-handle out of Charlie’s hand. Charlie
shook his head, then yelled down the
shaft. “Hey, Joe! Where’s that reviver?
I’m beginnin’ to see ’em again.”

“Guy Mopoke”; “The best rider of
buckjumpers I ever struck,” said Andy,
“was Joe Field, from the Lower Darl-
ing. I see him mount an outlaw one day,
and the only thing he held in his right
hand was a wax-match. He rode that
thing round till we got giddy watching
him, and when he had enough he jumped
off, lands just behind his mount, which
lashed out with both heels. Joe side-
steps quick an’ lively an ’ strikes the
match on the outlaw’s hoof as it goes
past him and calmly lights the cigarette
he’d been holding in his mouth.”

“Telarb”: “Laetitia’s” par (B.
21/7/’4B) concerning the “baidem epi”
of the Torres Strait islander is not quite
correct from the point of view of the
western islanders, who believe that the
'sea-louse acts as a sort of advance-agent
for the shark. The drill is this: Epi de-
taches itself from the shark and makes a
reconnaissance. It fastens itself to a
diver, and if the taste is to its liking it re-
turns to its host with the glad tidings
that dinner awaits his pleasure. Conse-
quently, if the louse leaves an islander
voluntarily and mizzles off it is time to
make for the surface, and these “boys”
swear it is only a matter of minutes be-
fore the shark arrives. No one would
dream of detaching the louse until safe
on the deck.
* * * *
“Old Bushman”: Mention of cow-
bell-responding wethers (B, 18/8/’4B) re-
calls droving down the Wilcannia-Ivanhoe
stock-route (N.S.W.) years ago. At break-
fast one dawn the new shepherd said
“That ruddy bell on Silver there—it’s the
same as the cook’s bell at the homestead
I just left. All night I kept waking think-
ing it’s breakfast!”
* * * *
“Kelms”: “G’roper’s” par about the
square mile that required four miles of
fencing (B. 4/8/’4B) started an argument
that the local John hasn’t stopped yet.
Bill claims that the writer got mixed up
■ —what he really meant was a “mile
square.” “That’d give ’im ’is four miles.
But a square mile’s a different proposi-
tion —take a darn sight longer fence to go
’round that” Ted couldn’t see it. A
mile square and a square mile seemed
the same to him, and tempers were getting
as frayed as the scraps of paper on
which they drew their paddocks when
Smiley came in. Smiley’s got just 640
acres, making a square mile, so they piled
into Bill’s runabout and drove out. They
went around the farm —a long, narrow
strip less than half a mile wide —three
times before Ted accepted the speedo
reading of five and a half miles and paid
up. There the affair might have rested,
but the local chalkie explained that both
measurements could be the same—
although, in any numbers above one, miles
square are larger than square miles —
and opined that the fence required would
be the same if the square mile were
really square. Ted’s still talking fight
and offering a reward to anyone with a
640-acre farm that measures the same
on all sides.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: The rise and fall of
Baalbek is a controversial subject (6.
21/7/’4B), and wiser men than “Moujik”
and I have failed to reach a satisfactory
solution. In the absence of definite proof
I’ll continue to lean towards the theory
voiced by an ancient Arab writer who
described Baalbek as “a city possessing a
strong fortress, with columns erected by
Solomon.” The story, as I heard it from
a bearded shepherd of the Bekaa Plain,
was that Solomon built the city as a rest-
ing-place for his caravans when a dis-
pute with neighboring kings made
Damascus an unhealthy resort. There
were three temples. One each to Jupiter,
Bacchus and Venus, and the six great pil-
lars still standing, and which are de-
picted on Syrian paper currency, are the
remains of the Temple of Jupiter—not,
as “Moujik” avers, of Bacchus. The in-
iquity of the priests, my informant said,
lay in their practice of inaugurating
maidens into the devotions of, in turn,
Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus, It was the
liberal and practical interpretation of
these worshippings, he believed, that gave
rise to the city’s unsavory reputation and
led to its destruction by, perhaps, the dis-
gruntled members of a competing priest-
hood,
* * * *
“Lower Tops’l”; “G’roper” errs when
he claims that “W.A. was the only .part
of our continent that ever knew the im-
pact of pirates” (B. 18/8/’4B). The first
real residents there —sealers at Albany
and Rottnest —were pirates who coasted
over from Tasmanian waters. Besides
the mutineers of the crew of the Batavia
on the Abrolhos —admittedly the most
colorful incident in Australia’s history—
Dampier careening the Cygnet, and these
sealers, what other records of buccaneers
other than conjecture has the West to com-
pare with the feats and numbers of Tas-
manian pirates? To begin with, those
“romantic names” I mentioned on the
Speck’s coastline are mostly self-
explanatory, excepting perhaps Pirates
Bay, so called in 1822 because of the
seizure there of Mr. George Meridith’s
schooner Seaflower by bushrangers who
turned pirates aboard her. In 1803, after
the company vessels left the sealing-
grounds in the Bass Strait islands to run-
away sailors and escaped convicts from
Sydney, these ruffians, some 200-odd,
lived by wrecking and piracy for decades.
As well, other freebooters thrived around
the Speck, and vessels captured and
turned-pirate are too numerous to men-
tion, though the best-known are the brig
Fredrick, at Macquarie Harbor in 1834,,
and the Cyprus, of overseas fame. Nor
were the pirates on Tassie’s shores all
local men. The first sealing vessels in
Bass Strait in the 1790’s were privateers
and pirates, notably the Harrington from
Chile, which brought their captures to
these island anchorages to deal with
cargoes and crews before entering Sydney.
Forty-two years ago, by the homestead
on little Kangaroo Island in Bass Strait, a
Miss Harley picked up, under a sandhill
which was then being dislodged by gales,
an old pipe, a silver button and a silver
Elizabethan coin. As the sandhill had
been known to be intact for more than
a century this find antedates the sealing
era and, incidentally, the Dutch in Wes-
tralia. Who knows —perhaps the “Sea-
Hawks of Devon” had been in Bass
Strait!
OLD LOGS.
Old grey mastodons gnarled and hard,
Down on their haunches scaled and scarred,
Notches and blotches on their hides,
Knotted limbs resting by their sides;
Sprawling and herd-like under the skies,
Hollow mouths gaping, holes for eyes,
Scaly buttocks and bellies deep:
Old grey logs lie fast asleep.
But mornings early ere the heat,
Then the old monsters start to eat:
See them now feeding—as per habit —
Each gulping down its white-tailed rabbit.

Pastures and Wool.
THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
“Betcha”: Sheep bred on in-
ferior country usually brighten
considerably when transferred to
improved areas, but don’t over-
look the effect of the change on
the wool. Quality and growth
of wool are influenced by local
conditions, feed and climate.
Our district is a medium one,
cool, with pastures partly im-
proved. Try as I may I am never
able to reach the quality and
price for merino wool got by
men in the high country, some
40 miles on. The pastures in
the snow country are light, con-
sisting largely of kangaroo-
grass and white clover. The
fleece, too, is light, fine and
clean. Annually I retain my
numbers with a d/aft of the
snow-country’s best lines. With
the better pastures and warmer
climate the sheep thrive well,
but though they probably cut a
slightly heavier fleece, as well as
the dusty tip and vegetable con-
tent the wool tends to grow
stronger.
Local graziers who have im-
ported strong - woolled rams
from warmer and better-pas-
tured districts, keeping the rams
over a period of years, complain
that the wool grows gradually
finer and is not the same count
as when the sheep were bought.
, Lucerne-cutting.
“Myrr”: Cut when the
flowers are appearing or the
shoots of the succeeding growth
are starting from the crown of
the plant. Either or both may
be used as a guide, but the new
shoots are the better indication.
An average stand, taken off at
these stages, will yield five cuts
a year. Care is needed at harvest-
ing, as the leaves are easily
shattered and bleached by over-
exposure, and loss of green
color represents a loss of the
best feed qualities in the hay.
In Victorian districts allow
the cut to lie in the swathe for
a day unless it’s hot. In such
weather the rake should follow
the mower soon after cutting.
Care should be taken not to
stack the hay while it is moist,
but the risk of heating will be
greatly reduced by sprinkling
each layer of hay with coarse
salt at the rate of 201 b. of salt
to the ton.
Frost-prevention.
“L Frost”; Spring frosts in
S.A. and Vic. irrigated vineyards
and orchards are now mitigated
or avoided by practices designed
to conserve solar heat in the
surface soil. This is done by
disking-in cover-crops and weeds
before the mid-August irrigation.
The land is then irrigated every
three weeks until the end of
October, any form of soil dis-
turbance being avoided. Ob-
structions which dam back drift-
ing chilled air are cleared unless
they divert it from the property.
Large areas of mallee scrub
adjacent to fruit properties are
removed, but windbreaks are
allowed to stand and pruned up
if at the lower end of the
property. Frost damage is
usually more widespread and
severe in late spring, when the
fruit has set and cannot stand
coldness withstood earlier. Con-
servation of heat ‘in the soil
offers a better chance of avoiding
marginal frosts of one or two
degrees or reducing their in-
cidence.
Solar heat is mainly stored in
the top 6in. of soil during the
day and lost at night. Theory is
that water added to the topsoil
increases its heat - storage
capacity; burying of the cover-
crop adds humus and increases
the capacity to hold water and
heat. Decomposing green
manure may a useful
contribution of heat, irrigation
or rain compacts and reduces
surfaces from which heat is lost,
and by retarding the rate of loss,
prolongs heat-storage life of the
soil. Irrigation may also raise
local humidity to impede radia-
tion.
Cultivation disperses heat by
aeration and evaporation, leaving
a rough surface which resists
the entry of solar heat, but facili-
tates radiation of heat at night.
Until recompacted, disturbed
soil offers cold surfaces for the
generation of chilled air to drift
and bank up. If colder than
the vines, the soil will draw heat
from them and accelerate their
heat losses.
Basing a Machine.
“Kayser”; The method out-
lined in B. 18/8/’4B embraces
one of the cardinal sins of
machine-installation, known in
the trade as “lining of the tern-
plate.” No experienced en-
gineer will attempt this on im-
portant work, as it is practically
impossible to “get a line.” I
suggest the following: Assum-
ing the bed is of weight, shape
and mixture suitable to the class
of country in which it is in-
stalled, also that the form for
the pedestal is the correct size
and shape, the frame need con-
sist of nothing more than two
loose pieces of Sin. x lin. long
enough to fit across the top of
the form or pedestal-box.
Before placing in position,
secure .four pieces of Sin.
“Who did that?”
down-piping—old rusty stuff
with a few’dents in will do—
of lengths suitable to the size
of the base-bolts. Snip down
the end of each in several
places to a depth of about lin.
and fold the pieces out at
right-angles. With |in. clouts
—two to. each pipe is sufficient
—fasten two to each piece of
Sin, x lin. with their centres
corresponding to the hole
centres across the machine’s
base.
Then place the Sin. x lin.
timber across the form with
the pipes projecting downward.
Draw them apart until the
distance separating their centres
corresponds with the length-
wise measurement of the base
holes.
Squaring is a simple matter
of pushing the end of the rule
against the sides) of the pipes
and measuring to the sides of
the form, side and front read-
ings to each pipe. Tack in
position by driving 2in. nails
almost home to avoid hammer-
ing, which damages green
cement. Twenty-four hours
after filling pull the tacks with
a claw - hammer and prise
clouts out with a screwdriver.
Unless) the mixture used in
filling is of unnecessary sloppi-
ness there is no risk of the
pipes filling from the bottom.
When ready for fitting the
machine any protruding tin
can be safely knocked down
with a hammer. Drop the bolts
in the holes, push up through
machine-base and fit nuts and
washers.
Pour in very wet rich grout-
ing and fill each pipe, drop
machine, level and line it up.
As can be seen, should the
pedestal itself be out of align-
ment there is (allowing for
bolt diameter) a full inch of
movement available in any
direction to overcome any
initial error.
Poisoning Crows. *
“Horseless Horseman”: The
only way to do it is with phos-
phorus and meat. Almost
always the birds regurgitate
strychnine and other baits, but
they do not wake up to phos-
phorus till it is too late.
It’s no good laying baits here
and there. Make a thorough job
of it.
Go round the lambing pad-
dock in a sulky and cut any
freshly-dead ewe into quarters,
putting the pieces at intervals
along a line. If the crows are
exceptionally bad go on free-
feeding them for a day or so.
Next take an old stag and kill
it in the paddock. The point is
that the meat should be warm
when the S.A.P. is inserted in it.
If it is cold slightly heat the
poison. In western N.S.W. we
found that the crows remained
a day or so, then suddenly one
and all would disappear. Those
killed would be found in the
green timber near by ; the others
cleared out never to return.
Pig-feed.
“Bill C.”: Soaking feed in-
tended for pigs does not increase
its food value, but it is helpful
in that it makes crushed grain
much easier to handle and pre-
vents waste. Boiling food is not
worth while, either, except in the
case of soya-beans and potatoes,
the food value of which it im-
proves. Wheat, sorghum grain,
maize, barley and pollard are
foodstuffs that are. not improved
by preliminary boiling. In fact,
it may destroy some of their
minerals.
Offal should always be boiled
lest it be carrying the germs of
t.b. or swine-fever. If you sus-
pect that some of your milking
cows have t.b. you may safely
feed their milk to the pigs after
it has been boiled, but have the
suspect cattle tuberculin-tested
immediately and get rid of any
reactors.
Conserving Mitchell Grass.
“Chappie”; Although it is
generally considered that fodder-
conservation is not practicable
in Queensland’s Mitchell-grass
country, one central-western
Queensland station, Maneroo,
has proved that it is possible.
Mitchell-grass hay made several
years ago is now being fed to
sheep, and the station is nearing
the end of 3000 bales. Dr. M. C.
Franklin, of the C.5.1.R., who
specialises in animal nutrition at
the McMaster Institute, recently
visited* Maneroo and found a lot
to interest him.
It had always seemed to him,
he said, that fodder-conserva-
tion must be practised more, and
although some said it could not
be done, others were doing it.
The fact that feed costs were
higher in Queensland than in
N.S.W. indicated the greater
need for growing feed reserves
on the home property. Dr.
Franklin is lecturing to an ani-
mal-husbandry school for
veterinary officers and stock-
inspectors at Gatton College,
organised by the v Queensland
Department of Agriculture, and
in between times he is seeing
much of Queensland’s pastoral
conditions. He considers that
insufficient use is being made of
what is already known of feed
values for stock, a subject in
which he has been carrying out
research work for some years,
particularly in the 1940 and
1945 droughts in north-western
N.S.W. and the Riverina.
That Last Rabbit.
“Doc Flat”: Though traps
won’t clean a paddock of rabbits,
they are invaluable for picking
up the stragglers. After the
area is dug out and worked over
so often with a dog-pack that
bunnies are scarce, bring out
the traps. Set under likely logs,
sheltering rocks and corner-posts,
with a branch or stick placed
overhead to protect them from
stock. These traps need be in-
spected only at odd times. As
the catch is usually dead when
found, the pelts are lost, but it
is the riddance of the rabbit that
counts.
Only strict vigilance picks up
that last rabbit, but with clean
neighbors and good fences he is
worth going after. At sign of
scratches, traps should be set on
the. evidence and placed wisely.
One farmer, who had dug out
and dogged his property until
not a rabbit could be found, and

who was prepared to swear the
last one was gone, tried the
traps. Over a period of weeks
he was astounded to catch 100
rabbits. Even with a paddock
that has been clean for years
there comes a time a stray from
the roadway finds its way in and
a few set traps save hours of
hunting.
Contour Levels.
“H. 8.8.”: Carrying about
over hilly country of that letter
A made of lengths of 3in. by
2in. (B. 28/7/’4B) strikes me as
hard enough work by itself, par-
ticularly when one realises that
its base is 12ft, long and its apex
must be IQft. high if a fall of
lin. in 10ft. is to be indicated.
Why not use the easy method
of fitting any appropriate length
of half-inch garden hose with
glass ends and nearly filling with
water? Take any length con-
venient, 10ft. to 60ft. of hose,
slip into each end a 9in. length
of glass tubing of outer
diameter, nearly fill with water,
and seal the free ends of the
glass tubes. The hose, laid along
the proposed pipeline, has its
glass ends held upwards, giving a
true level from end to end as
indicated by the waterlevel seen
in the glass tubes. Using a. 60ft.
hose and driving in pegs to indi-
cate the contour, a level line can
quickly be run which will rival
the accuracy of a surveyor’s job.
For open but lined drains, a
fall of lin. in 10ft. is fairly
usual; for pipelines the fall can
be anything greater which the
country will permit. Naturally,
up to the point where water
friction fails to allow faster flow,
the greater the fall the greater
the rate of flow; if unlined earth
channels are to be made, then
the fall must be kept very small,
as otherwise the water velocity
will quickly erode the channel-
banks —a fall of Ift. to the mile
may, in that case, be all nature
will permit. As the mathematics
of water-flow is known for all
normal forms of drain, pipe and
rate of fall, the local shire
engineer could probably be pre-
vailed upon to calculate the dis-
charge available from any pro-
posed scheme. The waterhose
level is, by the way, a great
time-saver for builders laying-out
floors in a new building.
Concrete Lore.
“Yendis”; Absorption of
water is common when mixing
concrete or mortar, and mixing
ratios can vary for many rea-
sons. In one concrete job the
mixture of aggregate required
for one cubic yard of concrete
was 36 cubic feet of sand and
metal, plus seven bags (each one
cubic foot) of cement. On
another job, with materials
drawn from a different source,
the gauge was 32 cubic feet for
one cubic yard of concrete.
The setting of the mortar re-
ferred to (B. 18/8/’4B) is nor-
mal. Cement and sand, when
mixed with water, form a paste
which begins to set soon after
it is moistened. When “Mac”
added water to remix his mortar
he should have added more
cement, as the setting process
had been broken down, and
extra cement- was required to
freshen-up the mixture. With-
out this the mortar would be
weaker than a batch used im-
mediately. General building
practice limits the time for a
batch of mortar to be used to
30 minutes. Concrete must be
placed immediately it is mixed.
Hints for the Farm.
“Radian”: Sections cut from
old motor-tyres make an ideal
covering for the teeth of an idle
circular-saw. This prevents pos-
sible damage to both saw and
owner.
“M,”: When after the cut-
worm, first of all keep down
weed growth and bait with a
mixture made from 41b. of bran,
3oz. of Paris-green or sodium
arsenite or 6oz. of lead arsenate
and l£lb. of salt. Mix
thoroughly with enough water to
make a moist, not sloppy, mash
and spread near plants in the
evening,
“Girrawheen”: Guard against
rot in wooden floors by keeping
them dry, for, contrary as it may
sound, dry-rot is caused by
dampness. If necessary to wash
a floor be sure all doors and
windows are open to ensure
quick drying. In sheds, barns,
etc., it pays well for any time
spent in drying patches where
liquid has been spilt.
“Bumble”: Supplies of bee-
keeping material are short, but
it is doubtful if putting in boxes
and frames of varying sizfes will
be of any lasting advantage to
an apiarist building-up or re-
newing stocks. During extract-
ing periods the transfer of ex-
tracted combs from hive to hive
plays a big part in the task o£
taking off honey, and there will
be delays and inconvenience if
sections of the apiary have to
be worked separately. The off-
standard sizes should be avoided
entirely if possible, or taken on
as makeshift only till others are
procurable. There are chances
of reselling to those who keep
a limited number of hives as a
hobby or sideline, for whom
they are generally satisfactory.
“Myrrhee”: Zinc deficiency in
citrus is characterised by
mottled, yellowish, small and
abnormally narrow leaves. Seri-
ously-affected trees show a lot
of die-back and a tendency to
fall away in cropping. It’s
prevalent in most western
N.S.W. citrus-growing areas,
especially on lighter soils. Spray
in spring with a solution of
101 b. of zinc sulphate, 51b. of
hydrated lime and 100 gallons
of water.
“M.”: Don’t wait for cab-
bage-butterfly grubs to'appear;
start dusting as soon as the first
butterfly is noticed. Use a 50
p.c. lead-arsenate or D.D.T.
vegetable dust, or a spray made
up of 4oz. of lead-arsenate paste
or 2oz. of powder in 4gal. of
water. Spray or dust every 14 days
throughout the butterfly season.
“Bill C.”: Rape is often re-
commended as a good green feed
for poultry, but too much of it
will discolor the eggs. A
Queensland man found that his
hens were laying eggs with olive-
hued yolks because they were
getting only rape as green feed.
Green lucerne, silver beet, cab-
bage leaves or grass are safe as
green feed.
“C. Punch”: At the Perth
(W.A.) Show and sales in Octo-
ber, N.S.W. will be represented
by five Poll Shorthorn bulls’, one
each from Wendouree, Mer-
riwa; Gunnawarra, Gulargam-
bone ; Dandaioo, Trangie ; Pine

the pies. As a matter of cold
fact, carefully concealed, no
apples and no cream were now
produced on the Texas Ranch.
These came from distant places,
and arrived at the Ranch by the
same route as the bus. In fact,
there was a heavy case by the
driver’s seat —and it might have
held apples, and there was a
sizeable metal can —and it
could have contained cream.
T* HE bus came to a halt in
1 front. The driver looked at
his watch —“You have,” said he,
“one hour here.” One hour!
Only an hour in this beautiful
spot! But you can manage to
get through quite a lot of apple
pie and cream in one hour.
Exodus commehced, slowed
down considerably by the dread-
noughts near the door. Nothing
could by-pass them. They rose
slowly and wriggled their sterns
to take out the creases and folds.
“Our seats!” they said, but the
driver said nothing.
The farmer’s—or rancher’s —
wife met the vanguard on the
verandah. Fat, jolly sort of
woman good advertisement
really for apple pie and cream.
“This wav.” she said, and added
the regulation remark —“Have a
good trip down?” Everyone had
a good trip down—if they hadn’t
they wouldn’t be here at all.
Mrs. Dibby, the rancher’s wife,
steered the leaders of the herd to
the big dining-room, and the rest,
in the way of herds, followed.
The funny man was gurgling
“This is the Promised Land
flowing with cream and pie.”
Mrs. Dibby’s chins rippled in
appreciation of the funny man.
Two girls appeared from a
dark hole in the wall that must
have been the doorway to the
kitchen. They went round the
tables to take the orders, for
there were certain absurd alter-
natives to apple pie and cream.
To wit, hot scones and cakes. As
if anyone would want hot scones
and cakes. Nobody did, and
nobody cared what happened to
the supplies of these things. It
had to be apple pie and cream.
Back and forth went the girls
with trays —plates with modest
sectors of pie and glass dishes of
cream.
“My, oh my! Whipped cream,
too!” cried someone in delight.
Yes, indeed, the cream had been
whipped. Mrs. Dibby, having
done the honors of welcome,
assisted the girls. Talk "had sunk
to monosyllabic “Oh’s!” “Ah’s!”
and “Greats!” Sounds of stir-
ring tea, spoons on plates, and a
fainter rhythm of jaws dealing
with apple pie and cream.
The funny man made a funny
remark to one of the serving
girls—the thin one with the
yellow hair. She retorted “Oh,
yair!” which was considered
funny too, being much in keep-
ing with a ranch.
Like a field stripped of its
verdure by the locusts, so was
that dining-room of its apple pie
and cream. Only crumbs and
smears were left. And even the
crumbs were picked over and
the smears scraped again with
spoons. Mrs. Dibby, in the best
traditions of the bushrangers of
the near-by cave, pleasantly ex-
torted the toll of two shillings a
head. “Daylight robbery!” was
the unspoken thought, but every-
one paid up, and a drift set in to-
wards the bus.
A SMALL boy was-standing
on the step of the bus, and
waving excitedly. “Hurry!” he
shouted to his mother and his
auntie, who were strolling along
in the bitterness of “six shillings
for that! —six shillings for the
three of us!”
“Hurry!” shouted the boy.
“Vincent, do behave yourself,”
said his mother irritably.
“They’re gone!” shouted the
boy. “Hurry!”
“What’s gone?”
“The seats!”'
And it was true —or nearly so.
The bus was practically filled,
and mostly with entirely new
faces. Faces whose owners had
sneaked in from somewhere out
of the blackberries, and had
taken illegal possession of the
seats. Mother gasped and auntie
sniffed. Their good easy seat
amidships was gone—occupied
by a red-faced young man in
shorts and a hefty damsel in
shorter shorts. Hikers! An ob-
jectionable breed!
“Go him!” said the boy in
supreme confidence in his
mother.
“Be quiet, Vincent, can’t you!
Excuse me! But you have our
seats.”
“I think not,” said the hiker.
“These are our seats.”
“Well, I never!” said Auntie
in indignant aside. “The cheek
of some people!”
“Did you pay a return fare?”
demanded Mother.
“I did not.”
“Well, I did—for those seats.”
“Interesting but entirely
irrelevant,” said the damsel,
pertly and coolly.
Mother took in the rest of the
bus—a horribly nondescript lot
; —hikers, shooters, and a family
that had stood all the way down,
and now seated and scarcely try-
ing to hide their smirking satis-
faction. They had not gone into
the ranch-house for apple pie
and cream. They had not paid
two shillings a head. The six
shillings for apple pie and cream
nearly choked Mother and
Auntie. Boy disappointed that
there was no ding-dong go after
all. Right at the back were seats
still empty. They were anout
as inviting as the steerage end of
an old North Coast steamer.
But better grab them just the
same. A line of apple-pie eaters
was approaching.
QUITE unaware of the rude
shock awaiting them, the
two battleships sailed slowly to-
wards the door. They were deep
in a grievance—their bits of pie
had been doughy, yes, doughy!
And beneath the doughiness was
the charge of two shillings. But
they didn’t mention the two
shillings. They just stuck to the
dough, as it were. And then!
Did eyes deceive, or were those
two forms in that front seat —
their seat —real? There was no
deception— two horrible fellows
with hairy legs ending in military
boots were calmly seated at full
ease. They had pea-rifles. One
of them had a dead rosella hang-
ing from his belt.
.“Thank you!” said the first
dreadnought in tones that
blended demand and sarcasm.
“Don’t mention it,” said he of
the rosella with unbecoming flip-
pancy,
“Doesn’t it occur to you that
you have our seats?”
“It doesn’t occur,” replied the
rosella man.
“Will you please vacate our
seats?”
“Certainly—when we take
your seats.”
“At once!”
There was nothing doing.
Breathing vengeance and com-
menting heavily on “men,”
“manners” and “nowadays,” the
components of the Navy went
down the back to the small space
left there. And then they
quarrelled bitterly with Mother
and Auntie over the trifling de-
tail of Vincent taking up a full
seat.
“You should read the notice,”
said a hard-faced young lady
over her shoulder.
“What notice?” demanded the
first dreadnought, bringing hei
guns to bear on the hard-faced
young lady.
“The notice in front there.
“What about it?’*
“Only that it says —No seats
reserved in this bus.”
“Well, I didn’t see it. And it
makes no difference. We had a
moral right to those seats.”
Others arrived. A few
squeezed in the back seats. And
then there was nothing left but
the aisle to stand in. It was an
awful crush, not even room to
stand properly. Mr. Slack and
the young thing with nice legs
stood. They didn’t seem to
mind. Miss Frost stood. So did
Miss Spooner —and Mr. Bodge.
Miss Spooner had a scathing re-
mark to make about chivalry —
and did Mr. Bodge remember
that quotation about the age of
chivalry being gone? Mr. Bodge
did very well though he
couldn’t quite recall just how it
went. The funny man stood,
after inquiring loudly if there
was a spare knee anywhere. But
ttfere was rather a heavy dis-
count on his funniness now. A
good deal of mutterings about
such things as “squatters,”
“jumpers,” “absolute meanness,
I reckon,” and these but served
to underline the bitterness over
small helpings of doughty apple
pie.
Miss Diggle and Miss Lime
werei in a sense, closer together
than they had ever been before.
But they didn’t complain.
“It’s fun, really, / think,” said
Miss Diggle.
“All in the day’s outing,” said
Miss Lime.
The driver was the last in. He
had to claw his way through the
pack. He was not upset at the
monstrous load. He listened in
friendly seriousness to a crushed
lady who threatened to report
him for overloading: “See if I
don’t!”
“Get on the roof —there’s no
one there,” called out a rude
male voice. It sounded much
like the rosella man.
UP the winding pass the bus
crawled and groaned and
swayed. And the long, long hill
went on for ever] With tact and
delicacy the driver said not a
word about Bushrangers’ Caves,
or Castles, or Churchills or
Queens of Sheba. No one
wanted to see them, anyway.
They were pretty rotten resem-
blances, anyway. The rosella
man and his mate talked to the
driver, and he answered quite
amiably over his shoulder.
Occasionally, like the small still
voice of Conscience in a noisy
and miserable world, could be
heard the voice of him whose
father was out after the Gov-
ernors —“I’m sure he’s wrong
there —my father told me over
and over again that those”
Blast the bushrangers anyway!
Who cares?
Chug! chug! grind! grind!
and up and up, till at long last
on top once more, and into the
level rays of a setting sun. Be-
hind, below, if one were in-
terested enough to look at the
wretched thing, was the Valley,
already, darkening between the
tall cliffs. Brooding under the
approaching night. Brooding
under its apple pie and cream.

“Declaring the Australian-Russian
Society to be a Communist under-
cover organisation, the A.L.P. gave
Clive Evatt, M.L.A., its president,
and E. J. Ward, , M.H.R., vice-
president, a fortnight to get out or
be expelled from the A.L.P. In Par-
liament Mr. Evatt had described as
‘absolutely false’ charges that the
society was under Communist influ-
ence.”
“Just fancy,” exclaimed the
president of the Russian-Aus-
tralian Comrades Society
heatedly, “some bad-minded
people jumping to the con-
clusion that our Society was
under Communist influence
merely because it stuck up for
the high Soviet principles prac-
tised by the Kremlin!”
“Exactly!” put in the vice-
president. “Some of these low
swine, simply because the ‘Tri-
bune’ attacked a couple of clerics
for saying they left the Society
because they objected to its dis-
tributing Communist propa-
ganda, have the gall to interpret
this as Communist support for
the Society. It’s positively the
last thing I’d have thought.”
“Another thing,” complained
the p. “Just because our Society
praises the peace-loving in-
tentions of the U.S.S.R., and
condemns the warmongering
policy of Britain and America,
some horribly suspicious people
think that Communists have a
hand in it. How utterly fan-
tastic!”
“Too right!” agreed the v.-p.
“Why! Quite a number of
people who aren’t members of
the Communist party dislike the
British Empire and its grasping
“ Gripes , I wish he'd hurry up and slap the handcuffs
on her."
litiperialism. Look at the things
I said about British capitalism
in Parliament —that is, before
Russia came to our assist-
ance when I condemned
Imperialist war and extolled the
great progress being made by
the peaceful Soviet. Yet none
of my electoral supporters would
even remotely suggest that I have
Red sympathies.”
“That’s right,” agreed the
p. “They’ve got a positively
Wonderful belief in you.
But another thing,” he went on
aggrievedly, “simply because
members of the Society express
unbounded admiration for the
efficiency of the Soviet’s methods
and speak of the great advantage
to the New Democracy it would
be if we were to enjoy the con-
centration-camp and slave-labor
systems here so as to scotch all
opposition to the will of the pro-
letariat, the utterly ridiculous
charge is made that the Central
Executive of the Communist
party has a sinister hand in the
doings of our Society. Doesn’t
this criticism itself virtually
amount to a demand for the sup-
pression of free thought and
speech which the Atlantic
Charter guarantees? It’s just a
lot of Red-baiting. You know
as well as I do that members of
our Society completely submerge
their private political opinions
in the interests of the larger
sphere of pure cultural con-
tacts.”
“There is too much jumping
to conclusions in these matters,”
put in the v.-p. “What if some
members do refuse to stand
up when they hear ‘God
Save the King’ played, but join
in frenziedly in the singing of
the ‘Red Internationale’? It
might mean simply no more
than that they regard the ‘God
Save’ as being full of dissonances
which offend their keen musical
susceptibilities, whereas they re-
gard the Red Anthem as almost
the perfect example of melody,
harmony and rhythm, worthy to
rank with the greatest composi-
tions of the classical masters.
After all, everybody is entitled
to his musical opinion, surely!”
“The fact, also,” said the pre-
sident warmly, “that our Society
has a liaison (pardon the word)
with an organisation like the
Eureka Youth Movement merely
indicates, if logic counts for any-
thing, that the Society maintains
anTntense interest in the Colony’s
early history, a thing which con-
firms its strong Australian
flavor.”
“The fact, too,” said the v,-p.,
“that our Society demonstrates
.its laudable desire to join in the
protest against exploitation of
the poor housewives in their
battle against profiteering by
maintaining strong ties with the
Communist party’s ‘New House-
wives’ Association’ is no criterion
of our Society’s interest in Com-
munism. It is pure coincidence
that in this policy our Society
and the Communist party pursue
a parallel course —and, as any
student of geometry knows, par-
allel lines can never meet.”
“Perhaps,” said the p., “the
weakest argument put up by our
enemies who are trying to ruin
the two of us politically by con-
demning our association with
what the A.L.P. regards as a
Communist organisation is that
our Society won’t tolerate any
criticism of the Soviet. Now
everyone knows that criticism in
any organisation makes for
bickering, and that’s bad. When
everyone thinks in harmony
everything goes along peace-
fully—that’s why the U.S.S.R.’s
so peacefully inclined —nobody’s
allowed to think differently. And
that’s why our Society has had
such a meritorious record of
harmony. But touching on our
own personal problems
whether to stick to our peace
principles with the Society and
forgo our cushy well-paid jobs,
or get out”
“Wait a minute,” broke in the
vice-president. “What’s this,
boy? A message? Whacko!
The Society has relieved us of
our positions! Our principles,
Mr. President, have been saved
again! ”

Rubber
For many years the Papuan rubber
industry has been taxed to the extent of
2d. a pound on all rubber imported into
Australia. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment, of course, likes it both ways and
levies an export tax on all wheat milled
for flour for natives of Papua and New
Guinea. The wholesale cost of flour and
wheatmeal has increased from 1.63 d. per
pound in 1941 to 7.63 d. in 1948, an in-
crease of 368 per cent. Rice, sugar and
other native ration lines have also in-
creased in price, and the cost of rationing
natives working on estates has increased
by 140 per cent, since 1941. And to the
foregoing can be added the costs of
wages, recruiting, passages, clothing,
medicines, etc.
The independent or village native, who
became very keen on Army foods during
the war, also has to pay these heavy costs,
plus the retailer’s profit. He resents it to
the extent of becoming a willing listener
to the many Communistic cliques in
Papua and New Guinea.
Under the Leonard Murray Govern-
ment Papua produced 1345 tons of rubber
for 1939-40. During the war, under the
able direction of Brigadier Don Cleland,
the Production and Control Board pro-
duced the following:
1942- 598 tons
1943- 1623 tons
1944- 1856 tons
Here are the figures under the Ward
regime:
1945- 920 tons
1946- 1006 tons
1947- 1275 tons
The outlook for the future is
gloomy because large areas of young
rubber have never been tapped, due to
shortage of labor. Planters estimate that
the 1947-48 figures represent only 50 per
cent, of possible production.
Gradually, as costs increase and labor
decreases, rubber producers will be forced
out of business. Some of them have al-
ready seen - what’s ahead and are using
their rubber areas for the production of
milk, butter and beef.
When the Papuan and New Guinea
plantations go out of business Australia
will have to rely on the Malay States,
Dutch East Ifidies, Indo-China, Ceylon
and India, The first three are riddled with
Communism and unreliable, while
Ceylon-India production is used mainly
in India. In war-time it would be impos-
sible to rely on any of them. In the last
war Australia relied mainly on Papuan
rubber with occasional shipments from
Ceylon.
Finally, why should rubber, which
calls for the utmost skill in extraction
and is practically manhandled through-
out, be the same price as before the war?
It is probably the only tropical product
in the world that has not increased to
double or treble its pre-war price. The
present slight improvement in price is
solely due to the Communist rising in
the Malay States, and cannot be con-
sidered as a firm price.—G. A. L. (Papua).
Nurses
There are several arguments against
compulsory nursing training for young
women (B. 18/8/’4B). To begin with, it
would mean the creation of yet another
Government department.
The current shortage of nurses in
public hospitals is a symptom and not a
cause. If conditions for trainee nurses
were made sufficiently attractive and the
profession advertised on a large scale,
the flow of nurses would naturally in-
crease. And voluntary recruits would be
twice as valuable as “forced labor” in-
troduced into hospitals under any com-
pulsory scheme.
Many young girls are unsuited to nurs-
ing, and most of them would resent being
pushed into such drudgery against their
will. The nursing profession would lose
rather than gain from such a procedure.
And why should six months of sweeping
wards and doing sponges produce better
wives and mothers than the following of
any other useful career?
Young women like jobs in offices,
theatres and the rest not necessarily be-
cause they dislike hard work, but because
they are reasonably sure that they will
be treated with kindness and considera-
tion. Do away with the old system of
treating trainee nurses like slaveys and
improve their living conditions and the
consequent increase in the ranks of nurses
will soon open hospital wards.
As for war-time, any girl of reason-
able intelligence, with or without the
backing of lectures, home nursing and
some hospital “hours,” could perform
the routine duties that would free trained
nursing staff for the more specialised
side of their work. This was well illus-
trated by A.A.M.W.S, personnel in mili-
tary hospitals during the last war.
Nursing, involving as it does the care
of the sick and feeble, is one job above
all others that calls for sympathy and
understanding. Such qualities could
hardly be nurtured under a system of
force. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Production and Tax
I recently visited the district where,
annually, I have bought a yarding of
good, locally-bred ewes, only to learn
that many of the district graziers are no
longer breeding sheep. Wool, they told
me, provided them with a living, so why
bother with all the extra work and worry
of raising lambs only to have most of
the money taken in taxation? The same,
thing happens with cattle. Many breeders
no longer stock to normal carrying capa-
city ; they are just holding on in the hope
that some day taxation will be lifted.
In March I called on a large hard-
ware firm for some building material.
They had none, but the boss told me
there was no real shortage—plenty would
be available again after the end of June.
The mills, he said, in order to ensure a
"No, no! I distinctly said CABIN trunks!”
turnover limited to a lower taxable group,
were not cutting. '
Greater production, and more work,
says Mr. Chifley. Then, as an imagined
fillip, he eases the tax on lower incomes—
the small percentage on the higher is al-
most negligible. This may please a greater
number of persons, armed with one vote
each, but doesn’t help to lift industry out
of the mess. It is production that is im-
portant, and easing the tax on his em-
ployees has no more effect on the pro-
ducer than a lot of fancy speeches.
With a farmer, no allowance is made
for his longer hours. No allowance is
made either, in the yearly toll, for the
work that has been done by his wife and
family. I’m a farmer. I live economically
and have few pleasures; my day begins
long before daylight and ends by lantern
light. , . ,
While the heavy tax remains on higher
incomes industry will never be restored.
A flat rate of taxation on all earnings
would at least be just.— Fed-Up (Vic.).
Strikes
The reaction of workers at Emmco’s
factory at Orange to the indefensible
strike by a handful of welders was a good
argument for New-Staters and advocates
of decentralisation. It was a change to
read of a union official being howled
down at a meeting of non-strikers, of an
attempt by non-strikers to get into a
room where union officials were confer-
ring and of brawls in hotel bars between
strikers and their critics.
There is none of that sort of thing
when a strike, however frivolous, brings
a big city factory or public utility to a
standstill. The explanation is simple.
The Emmco factory employs about
1300 hands, and the directors have
threatened to close the place if there is
continued industrial trouble. That would
be a blow to Orange, destroying the live-
lihood directly or indirectly of a con-
siderable number of townspeople.
In the big cities under present condi-
tions men who lose their jobs through
a strike can get others easily enough.
Hence the complacency with which they
generally regard industrial stoppages.
If a large proportion of Australian in-
dustries were situated in towns like
Orange, instead of being concentrated in
the few metropolitan centres, the influence
of Communist union leaders would de-
cline sharply. Not only is the country-
man less susceptible to their persuasions,
but the circumstances are against easily
engineered strikes. — Economist (N.S.W.).
Royal Torments
During 69 days of their Australian tour
their Majesties and the Princess will
attend 27 mayoral receptions, 10 other
receptions and six investitures, will see
three fireworks displays and two torch-
light processions, attend four official balls,
three garden - parties, eight official
luncheons and six dinners, three race-
meetings, two Australian Rules football
matches, a lifesaving display and rowing
championships.
In Victoria they will visit 20 provincial
towns, where they will have to listen to
20 loyal addresses, and be driven through
some of Melbourne’s more industrial
suburbs ; the King will open three State
Parliaments, preside at a Privy Council
meeting where Mr. McKell will be sworn
in as G.-G.; open the' Sydney Royal
Show; and lay several foundation-stones,
exact number not stated. There will be
seven days free from official engagements.
In the whole list there’s not a solitary
aesthetic item, except a Command Per-
formance by the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra. Their Majesties wifi converse
with hundreds of dud politicians, dull
bumbles and officials, but no Australian
writer or artist is mentioned.
I don’t suppose anybody would say that
the Royal couple would find Norman
Lindsay or William Dobell less interest-
ing to talk to than Mr. McKell, or the
Victorian Legislative Assembly more
elevating than the Rembrandt self-portrait
in the National Gallery. And I don’t
suppose they will speak to a boundary-
rider unless, like Haroun-al-Raschid,
they slip out on one of the seven evenings
free from official torture. — Lord Luvus
(Vic.).
Public Service
Increased staff in the Attorney-
General’s and other permanent Govern-
ment departments (B. 25/8/’4B) is due
mainly to increased business.
Consider the Cable Records Section
(N.S.W.) of the P.M.G.’s Department.
With only a slightly increased staff and a
new card-index system this section is
earnestly trying to cope with as many as
60,000 new applications for phones each
month, this new business swelling the
tens of thousands of waiting orders. In
King’s Cross alone there are large blocks
of flats each already served by 50 or more
lines, and each demanding as many as
25 more. It’s the same everywhere; Be-
fore the war the phone was considered an
advantage ; now it is regarded as a neces-
sity.
Similarly, most other Government de-
partments are genuinely “overboard,” and
while some branches may be overstaffed
others could do with even further assist-
ance. — Linesman (N.S.W.).
Abos and Measles
“Horseless Horseman” (B. 28/7/’4B)
claims 160 aboriginal deaths from measles
in Central Australia this year, but official
records of the epidemic in the country
around Alice Springs list only 28 deaths
in four big native reserves, covering some
5000 square miles.
About 1500 natives live in those re-
serves, and some 700 were infected be-
tween January this year and last month,
when the epidemic ended. There were 12
deaths at Yuendumu, three at Areyonga
and Hermannsburg, four among myalls
near Haast’s Bluff, four (including one
from childbirth and two from old age)
at Haast’s Bluff, while the remainder
were scattered through the areas.
Epidemics among aborigines are not
common these days, and this latest measles
epidemic ranks as one of the worst in
N.T. history—although it was not in the
same class as the scurvy outbreak at
Hermannsburg some years ago.
The good season early this year which
took so many abos on walkabout is the
probable reason for the widespread in-
fection. Only the timely cordoning of
the “top” from the “centre” kept the
disease from spreading to northern tribes.
The Department of Native Affairs
spent a lot of money in fighting the epi-
demic, and, strangely for a Government
department, spent it with imagination
and effect. It used planes extensively to
fly nurses from Adelaide and Darwin to
the infection points, and even parachuted
medicines, including penicillin, down to
settlement hospitals. Wet weather and
cold made the job harder for nurses,
doctors and patrol officers.
It is no small or enviable job to have
the responsibility for the lives of a couple
of thousand abos when disease is spread
by primitive habits, and where com-
munication across the few thousand
square miles to be policed and nursed is
hazardous and unreliable. In this case it
is generally considered that Native Affairs
did a good job.—R. H. (N.T.) &
The Root of the Matter
Rhodes Farmer’s belief that “within a
decade China may be a new and
powerful force in the Pacific and in the
world” (B. 11/8/ ’4B) is not shared by
Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, an authority on bio-
dynamic farming. In his Soil Fertility
Pfeiffer declares that, through unchecked
deforestation down the centuries, soil
erosion has become a most menacing
problem, likely to have a most serious
effect on China’s future —an opinion also
expressed by Jacks and Whyte in their
The Rape of the Earth. Pfeiffer says:
In the East catastrophes of most
tremendous magnitude are in process of
preparation. The overpopulated land in
China has reached the extreme limit of its
productive capacity in meeting even the
minimum existence standards of the people
living on it. Next to this are the poor,
hilly regions, stripped bare of their trees.
A human catastrophe is in preparation that
will influence Europe.
—Kanimbla (N.S.W.).
Formation of new States has been
much easier in U.S.A. than in Australia
because all territory beyond the boun-
daries of the 13 original member States
was vested in the Federal Government.
When a particular region was sufficiently
settled to warrant Statehood, there was
no serious obstacle. West Virginia, sepa-
rated from Virginia after the Civil War
as reward for having supported the North,
is the only case I can recall where a new
State was carved from an old one. In
Australia only two territories came under
Commonwealth control with Federation,
and neither is yet populous enough to be
given status as a State. New States in
Australia must, otherwise, be carved from
existing ones —with the consent of the
latter. — Glenroy (N.S.W.).
High taxation, particularly the Social
Service Tax, has hit farmers hard.
During the depression average farmers
in Westralia’s wheatbelt had no income
after costs of production were met. Often
it was impossible to meet current ex-
penses, and mortgages and other debts
increased. Today gross incomes from
wheat and wool are high, and even a
small wheat-and-sheep farm, shows over
a thousand pounds a year clear. Yet
farmers still owe millions, mainly be-
cause they are paying out in taxation
money that should be going to clear the
mortgages. — Olive Willey (W.A.),
In this town common envelopes sell at
lOd. to Is. a packet of 25. A ton of paper
costing, say, £7O will make nearly half
a million letter-size envelopes, or 20,000
packets of 25. At Is. a packet this is
£lOOO, surely an exorbitant profit, even
allowing for the cost of gum, labor and
machinery.— Metax (Tas.).
There’s a scheme afoot to settle
migrants on small farms in the Otways
(Vic.). The farms are to be made ready
for production, with stock and plant pro-
vided, and there are to be easy terms of
repayment. It’s a good scheme, very
similar to that by which returned soldiers
are being settled on the land, and it
should appeal to many prospective
migrants. But there is an appalling lag
in soldier-settlement, which must be given
precedence to any other plans, and
are dozens of young Australians who,
though unqualified by military service to
get a start on the land, would relish the
idea of taking on a farm on such terms.
—E.2 (Vic.).


behind a fa9ade of nonsense. With
the exception of Leo Piccioli’s
Barber, it was in this mood that the
opera was done at Melbourne His
Majesty’s. There was much play with
hats, and the hats were of extraordinary
dimensions, and considerable liberties
were taken with Rossini’s music, though
the composer himself provided the pre-
cedent for that, as he replaced the lost
overture with another which had nothing
to do with the happenings in Seville.
Count Almaviva’s opening address to
his mistress was originally a ditty sung by
a Persian king in the ancient capital of
Nebuchadnezzar, then by a Roman
emperor in a Syrian oasis and later as an
invocation to the goddess Isis. With the
rich vocal instrument of Rodolfo Moraro
behind it, it served equally well as an in-
ducement for Rina Mariosa to tromp her
elderly physician lover. Miss Mariosa
displayed much of the vocal agility in the
higher reaches of Toti dal Monte in a
previous season, and when she let her-
self go in the singing lesson she never
made the audience fearful that her
coloratura would tumble off the tight-
rope.
Carlo Badioli turned in another- ornate
performance as the rickety old physician,
and Antonio Cassinelli poured an in-
credibly deep bass and an equally in-
credible figure into the part of Basilio,
the music-master. It was Signor Piccioli
as Figaro, however, who held the show
together. He obviously enjoyed the part
of the gay, intriguing barber, and his fun
was never exaggerated. His extraordinary
virtuosity both as a patterer and a singer
in the “Largo al factotum” brought the
house down. Deputy conductor Manno
Wolff-Ferrari wielded a skilful baton.

Robert Montana, at ms Sydney Con.
recital, demonstrated that he is fond—
too fond —of ending songs an octave
higher than they should be ended, purely
with the object of airing a falsetto. That
illegitimate offspring of the vocal art
may bring a shriek of pure joy from the
bobbysoxers,- but it usually illustrates
productive weaknesses in the singer. This
was all too true with the tenor—he lacks
a full round tone, right up the scale.
There is also too much of a sameness
about his singing—the exaggerated
dramatisation of the half-voice on a
descending scale, the Tauber-like em-
phasis on the emotional catch in the voice.
Mr. Montana, in fact, seems to have
modelled his technique on that of Tauber,
though he hasn’t the advantage of
Tauber’s splendid quality of voice. Quite
a number of the dead tenor’s favorite
songs are also in his repertoire: “Yours
Is My Heart Alone,” “Girls Were Made
to Love and Kiss,” “Once There Lived a
Lady Fair” —these were given with all
the well-known Tauber inflections. The
best singing of the night was in some
Schubert and Schumann lieder, where the
song was quiet and reflective, as in
Schumann’s “ ’Twas In the Lovely Month
of May.” In the charming lilt of Schu-
bert’s “Hedge Roses” and his “By the
Sea,” the singer was almost impressive.

“C. 8.”: Jacob Lateiner, the 19-year-
old Polish pianist from Cuba, has been
leaving packed houses bowled over at
Melbourne Town Hall, by the astounding
virtuosity of his playing. His perform-
ance in the Tschaikowsky Concerto No. 1
in B Flat Minor, in conjunction with the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, was an
amazing performance. The work, which
pianist Nicholas Rubenstein told the com-
poser was worthless, unplayable, common
and vulgar —he subsequently altered his
opinion—appeared to present no diffi-
culties for the pale, fragile-looking youth.
The powerful thumping chords which
open the opus were sounded with tre-
mendous confidence, and in the later cad-
enza the pianist’s hands became a white
mist above the keyboard. The speed with
which the thing was taken didn’t seem
to throw the rest of the work out of
focus, and in the second movement, with
its rich themes and one of , the loveliest
melodies the Russian composer ever ex-
ploited, there was a spirituality which
most young performers usually don’t
attain to. The no-encore precedent was
broken, and Professor Heinze sat among
his musicians while Lateiner played a
Prokofieff toccata.
Kenneth Rowell’s exhibition at the
Macquarie Galleries includes some inter-
esting decor; and oils, watercolors and
drawings which are interesting only in
relation to what may be done with them
in the theatre. Rowell’s paintings, by and
large are decorative, and sometimes, as
in the oil, “The Blind Clown,” ugly.
There are heavy surrealistic overtones
which, in “Dancing Courtezans, ’ give
the odd image of a dancing lady with
two heads, both streaming with snake-
like hair, and, in other pictures, the
familiar visions of death and desolation.

to the New-State movement are the
number of letters written for this page
by people thinking about new States as a
practical and realisable need. It is time
the whole question came down to just
those points with which these writers
are concerned —where should boundary-
lines be drawn, what is the necessary
basic unit, and so forth.
It has been a fruitful few months on
the New-State front, set moving, of
course, by the Armidale conference. The
New Englanders will,, historically,
always have the distinction of giving the
movement form and driving-power, but
already the campaign is spreading far'
beyond New England, as it must if it is
to have a real meaning in Australian
development.
Probably the next most important
movement, after New England, is in
northern Queensland, where a small but
important local development of opinion
has been reinforced by Country-party
influence (as in New England, the C.P.
has been the spearhead of concerted New-
State thinking in Queensland). That, in
turn, has been given a de facto, if not
ail entirely dynamic, endorsement by
Hanlon’s Government, and it seems all
set to get moving.
Added to some growing discussion
about new States in the region of the
Snowy-Murray waters, into which Vic-
toria’s Premier Hollway has thrown a
not-discouragmg word, it seems that the
New-State movement is building up gener-
ally to the stage which the Federal move-
ment had reached about 1889. In that
year Henry Parkes suddenly threw the
30-year-old academic legalisms of the
Federal movement into a new high-gear ;
he brought Federation sharply into the
focus of the popular mind, thrusting an
impetus behind it which, within 10 years,
brought about the greatest political re-
construction the Australian continent had
known.
Nobody who has studied the trends of
Australian growth in more recent times
can doubt that new States today are what
Federation was in the time of Parkes —
the next great and essential political re-
construction—and it does seem that the
stage is set for another Parkes to rekindle
the enthusiasm which 50 years ago swept
Australia to nationhood.
Who may become the leader this time
it is difficult to say. I had always hoped
that Earle Page would be the man, but
it must be said that among many fine
political gifts Page does not include the
Parkesian capacity to arouse popular
imagination. Possibly there is a younger
man awaiting his chance to come forward.
Queensland, though, might well o’erleap
the New Englanders in the honor of first
attaining a new State, because the north-
ern State has a decentralised political
structure which makes its carving-up
much easier. Townsville is railhead for
important lines reaching westward and is
a natural focal point; Rockhampton is
in the same position, while Brisbane, too,
has its own natural railways feeding west.
With the main north-south coastal rail-
way system under a kind of inter-State
commission, the railways of Queensland
logically divide into three, so that with
transport, anyway, the New-State struc-
ture already exists.— Dee (N.S.W.).
Premier Hanlon’s announcement that
he proposed to divide Queensland into
several States was .very much to the lik-
ing of northerners. New-State moves
have been common in Queensland, but
they have never before had the support
of the Government.
Townsville and Mackay have been en-
couraging a fresh New-State move, and
it was given a good push along by Sir
Earle Page, who recently conducted a
lecture tour of the northern part of the
State. Page satisfied New-Staters that
they were on the right track, and con-
verted many others with this kind of
reasoning:
The best-watered area of Australia lies
between the Hunter River in N.S.W. and
Cape York in the north and from the
Pacific Ocean to 200 miles west. This area
is about one-tenth of the area of Australia.
It provides three-fifths of the running water
of the country and catchment basin for
most of the artesian water. This area also
has practically nine-tenths of the Australian
coal measures and three-fifths of the timber
of Australia, including practically all the
softwoods. It produces half the butter, all
the sugar, pineapples, bananas and other
tropical fruits and also a great proportion
of the meat, wool and wheat. Yet under
present conditions of government this most
fertile area of Australia does not hold its
natural increase (population) because of
Government policies backed by the great
city policies of Sydney and Melbourne, com-
bined with delays in development due to the
unwieldy size of N.S.W. and Queensland.
And even the most uninterested could
see the logic in:
The small scheme in the big State would
be the big and urgent scheme in the little
State. You will have investigations and
promises with the big State, but you’ll never
get anything done until you have small
States and your politicians in close contact
with the district they represent.
With the decentralisation of hospitals
and schools, and in the launching of the
regional electricity scheme, Premier
Hanlon has done something tangible. He
has beaten the Corns twice, and he is big
enough to bring the New-State scheme
to its logical conclusion. — See Ben (Q.).
Eden
Victoria wants the N.S.W.-Victorian
border moved a little north to include
Eden in Victoria, while other interested
parties have revived the agitation for a
new State with Eden the capital. What-
ever the outcome, the fact remains that
Eden could be made the port for a
number of industries in the vicinity. Fish
canneries are already established there,
and large quantities of railway-sleepers
have been shipped from Eden for many
years—there is timber to supply sleepers
for the next 100 years, with still enough
left to establish a newsprint mill, which
was talked about a few years ago.
Within 50 miles and less of Eden there
are, or have been, gold, bismuth and
molybdenite mines; drilling operations
have been carried .out near Merimbula
and in Gippsland, and, while oil was not
struck, there are many who believe that
these are the most likely places in Aus-
tralia.
Rabbit-canning was started within 30
tniles of Eden many years ago, and there
are enough rabbits in the district now
to support a factory for many years.
With the opening-up of Eden as a port,
both the Bega-Eden district and East
Gippsland could produce many times
their present output. The N. S. Wales
Government might do something to re-
tain the goodwill of the people by estab-
lishing industries —and giving farmers a
chance of getting their goods to market
quickly and cheaply.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Waste
The shortage of building materials is
made worse by the McGirr-Baddeley
Rural Workers’ Accommodation Act
“Out of luck again, Dig.; it's oil!"
compelling owners of properties, over
which a Government proclamation hangs,
to build huts, kitchens, dining- and store-
rooms to be used for only two or three
weeks a year. When resumed for soldier-
settlement in a year or two at least 75
per cent, of such buildings will be no
longer needed.
The owner of one. N. S. Wales station
was recently fined £92 18s. 4d. for
breaches of the R.W.A. Act. He pleaded
that in view of the Government’s inten-
tion to resume his property, it was a waste
of manpower, material and money to
comply fully with the act. He should
have known, of course, that “Labor”
glorifies in wasting other people’s money.
Although the old station might only have
a year or two before being split up, its
owner has been given six months to erect
new accommodation for both casual and
permanent employees.
The Labor Government of John Storey
would have shown its first concern for
families living in tents, bag and tin shacks.
Many are living under such conditions
not far out of Sydney, but the McGirrs
cannot see them. —F. D. (N.S.W.),
White Australia
Tucked away in “Other Cable Items”
in this morning’s paper is a seven-line
par. that should be of vital interest to
all Australians. It states that Japan’s
birth-rate for 1947 (34.8 per 1000) was the
highest since 1926 and the mortality-rate
the lowest since 1872. Put another way,
there are now 78,090,991 Japanese, of
whom 2,714,786 are under a year old.
In the face of this—and it is the same
story all over south-east Asia —we are
content to carry on with a population
that is practically stationary. The aver-
age Australian does not welcome babies
or migrants, even those of Anglo-Saxon
stock. The hope that migrants from
European countries with a high birth-
rate will continue producing children at
the same rate in Australia is, too often,
not realised.
Maternity allowances and child endow-
ment have done little, if anything, to
increase the number of Australian babies.
Marriage loans will only be another
handout to a class always on the
lookout for something for nothing.
Japanese parents got nothing from the
Treasury for their efforts in increasing
the birth-rate. Neither did the Javanese,
who have doubled their population in
50 years.
Japan was recently an enemy, and we
must seriously consider how much longer
its rapidly-growing population can be
compressed into the space available in
the Japanese home islands. It is more
highly industrialised and has a greater
veneer of Western ways than any other
place in Asia. The Japs make a living
as a manufacturing nation, underselling
countries with high wage scales, if we
are prepared to buy their goods. Not
being self-sufficient in foodstuffs, they
must export to obtain credits for food.
If we try to limit their manufacturing
output, so that they remain more or less
on the breadline, then they are going to
listen very readily to Communist
spruikers who will be urging them to
move to other lands with large unoccu-
pied areas.
Australia must have more migrants
and babies and give both a genuine wel-
come. Otherwise, first the Kimberley s
and then the Territory may be taken
from us in a series of appeasement pacts.
Against the day when our White Aus-
tralia attitude will be challenged by armed
colored races, we must increase our popu-
lation by at least 10 times the number
ftf men capable of bearing arms as
America put into this area in 1942. As
far as we are concerned Communism is
not operating from Moscow, but from
Bangkok, with all the country between
there and Australia seething and ripe for
any devilment. Bangkok is situated
approximately in the middle of a thou-
sand million Asiatics who are lapping up
Communism as a cat laps cream and, in
their spare time, reproducing as the Japs
are.
White Australia is living, at present, on
a certain amount of borrowed time.
Britain, France and Holland are not
novices in handling situations such as the
one that exists in south-east Asia today,
and, provided their attention is not re-
quired for matters nearer home, we have
time to put ourselves in order. A proper
realisation of the position, a decent wel-
come to the “new chum” and plenty of
hard work will go a long way toward
maintaining the real, or tacit, recognition
that the White Australia policy has re-
ceived from other nations. Hardworking
statesmen overseas will soon “give us
away” if we merely wish to bludge on
a slogan.— Noonamah (N.S.W.).
Blood-bank
An urgent radio appeal for blood
donations stated that the balance in the
Sydney Red Cross Society’s blood-bank
was two litres.
Explosions in industrial plants in Texas
and Germany, causing hundreds of casu-
alties, have pointed the lesson that indus-
try is likely to occasion the biggest single
urgent demand for blood; hence every
encouragement should be given to em-
ployees to volunteer as donors. Payment
for any reasonable time lost in that way
is already made by many firms.
Any Australian will contribute gener-
ously on payday when the hat is passed
to help an injured mate ; but blood is
usually needed as soon as the injured
mate reaches hospital. The time for
organisation and generosity is, in
this case, before the event. — Noonamah
(N.S.W.).
