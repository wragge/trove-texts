A MONUMENT TO HUMAN LOVE IS SCOTLAND'S SWEETHEART ABBEY
XTOW a picturesque ruin, Sweetheart Abbey was founded in 1275
for Cistercian monks by Devorgilla, whose son was for a brief
period King of Scotland. Her husband, John Balliol, founder of
Balliol College, Oxford, besides possessing large estates in England
and France, was also one of the Regents of Scotland.
Throughout their lives John Balliol and his wife Devorgilla
were devoted to one another. On the death of her husband
Devorgilla had his heart embalmed and placed in a casket of ivory
bound with enamelled silver. This relic, “her sweet, silent com-
panion,” was always kept in her presence until her death in 1289,
and then it accompanied her body to a sepulchre in the kirk of the
monastery which she caused to be founded.
By the seventeenth century this monument appears to have
been destroyed. A new one was then made, and fragments of it
were recovered at various times from the debris. These were
assembled, and in 1933 were set up in the south transept chapel.
The tomb was constructed iii table form, the sides being enriched
by traceried panels and shields. On it rests an effigy of the
foundress, supporting on her breast, between her hands, a repre-
sentation of the heart casket suspended by a chain from the neck.
As a tribute to the undying love of Devorgilla the Cistercian monks
chose the name of Sweetheart, or Dulce Core, for their abbey.
During the turbulent times following the death of James IV at
Flodden in 1513 the monks of Sweetheart Abbey placed themselves
and their tenants under the protection of Lord Maxwell. By the
Annexation Act of 1587 the abbey, with its revenues, was vested in
the King, and the abbot was compelled to return to France. This
abbot, Gilbert Brown, was the last abbot at Sweetheart Abbey,
and is said to have been the original of Scott’s abbot of St. Mary’s
in “The Abbot.”

FINE STATION NOVEL.
Esther Roland’s / Camp Here (Angus
and Robertson) is concerned with the
Bush: and that, at the present time, is
considered a very reprehensible subject
to write about. A painting, as every ex-
hibition demonstrates, must be about a
slum tenement; a novel must be about
Paddington. , ,
Since the fashion is thus established a
defence for I Camp Here immediately
suggests itself. When everybody else is
writing about slums, a scene such as this.
It was a shallow stream, running errati-
cally on a wide gravel bed between double'
banks and occasional wattle-sprigged,
boulder-strewn cliffs where it had sliced
through the rounded hills. There were
channels where the water ran melodiously
over stones, and wide still pools with
matted scum packed against the edges.
Clusters of smooth grey rock thrust up
from the water here and there, with soft
green slime trailed brightly around them.
On the banks there were sheoaks with their
roots laid bare and the debris of floods
caught against them, old rabbit-warrens
lost in blackberry bushes, and soft emerald-
green grass laced menacingly with thistles
is not only a pleasant and acute piece of
observation; it is bold, it is daring, it is
experimental, it is new.
And that is not merely a paradox, for
what is truthfully and freshly observed
is always new ; and the slum fashion has
been established, and I Camp Here does
break the pattern. If you look at a novel
for an unfamiliar background—which,
indeed, is not the essential requirement
of a work of art—then I Camp Here,
while the slum fashion is in vogue, has it.
If you regard a novel as a social docu-
ment —which again is no way to judge it
—then / Camp Here is highly significant
as such. It restores the balance to current
Australian fiction. Amidst a literary
movement overmuch concerned with the
cities it reminds one that there is, after
all, the land ; quite a lot of it in Aus-
tralia ; quite an important part of the
national economy ; important among the
elements which build the national
character. With equal significance, be-
cause Esther Roland, taking people as she
finds them, without propagandist bias,
deals humanly and naturally with the
relations between employer and employee,
she reminds one —and not before such a
piece of commonsense was due *to be
stated —that all rich men are not neces-
sarily wicked; that besides “exploiting”
the land they work it, cherish it and
provide work for others.
The slum fashion is, of course, recent
—even if our only great slum novel,
Jonah, was written many years ago and
if Henry Lawson (at his worst in the
Arvie Aspinall stories) was the spiritual
grandfather of the modern movement.
Looking beyond the present moment at
the broad stream of Australian fiction,
I Camp Here takes its place, in the
familiar tradition of land novels. Only
temporarily can it be called a revolu-
tionary work.
And yet, even within the bush tradi-
tion, its background is fresh and distinc-
tive ; it gratifies that geographical and
sociological curiosity into which all
readers of Australian fiction are likely to
be tempted: the continent being large and
full of variety, the range of fiction com-
paratively narrow. Whereas the tradi-
tional bush novel deals with bullockies,
swaggies, bagmen, hatters and shiftless
small-farmers, I Camp Here deals —
vividly, richly, comprehensively, alto-
gether convincingly—with the life of a
great station: a world that has been too
much neglected because of the plebeian
tradition which governs novels of the
bush as well as of the cities.
But it is not strictly relevant to its
merits as a work of art that I Camp Here
may be regarded from one point of view
as a corrective to the slum fashion or,
from another, as a welcome variation
within the bush tradition. The slums are
a legitimate setting for a novel; the bush
is a legitimate setting: all that really
matters is that the characters should be
convincingly portrayed and that they
should be dramatised as the portrayal
dictates.
Here, in this final test of artistic merit,
7 Camp Here is the best Australian novel
that has been published in many months ;
yet it falls short of excellence. The
characters, on the whole, are clear-cut,
credible and, more than that, portrayed
with depth and intensity. There is Garth,
the son of a station-hand, who, though
Esther Roland has attempted the
dangerous device of making the dullest
of her characters the central figure of her
novel, is interesting for his ambition, his
uneasy friendship and rivalry with the
squatter’s son, and his obsession with his
amoral cousin Jean. There is Kevin, the
son and heir of the property, a gay, like-
able, unstable youth who competes with
Garth for the favors of Jean and who
comes into violent conflict with his father.
And, essentially the dominating figure of
the novel, with force and dignity about
him even though he is not quite portrayed
“in the round,” there is the squatter
Moseley with his weak heart and his
strong, cold passion for his land.
Meeting these people, watching them
develop in the novel, it seems that one
of the things Esther Roland had originally
set out to do was to write an Australian
success-story —and that would not be at
all a bad thing to attempt: people do
succeed. The novel is to be, in part, the
story of Garth’s persistence andl triumph.
There is also the subterranean violence
in the characters to be dramatised in a
final clash: Garth’s passion for Jean and
his puritanic self-tortures ; Garth’s liking
for Kevin, his uneasiness with him as
his prospective employer, his antagonism
towards him as a rival in love; Kevin s
defiance of his father, whose cold rage is
so dangerous for his bad heart.
It seems certain —it is required as an
artistic necessity by the logic of the
characterisation —that Kevin will, in
effect, kill his father ; that he and Garth,
as friends and as rivals, and as employer
and employee, will resolve the situation
between them in final friendship or final
enmity; that Garth will achieve that
success in life on which his whole mind
is bent; and that, somehow or other,
probably by marriage, betrayal and
separation, Garth and Jean will bring
their relationship to dramatic conclusion.
But the novel takes quite a different
course ; far less dramatic ; disappointing.
It strays from its own logic, it dwindles.
Moseley survives the successive shocks his
son imposes on him. Garth, because of
a misunderstanding, is dismissed from the
managership of the station and goes off
to the war. Kevin is killed while serving
with the R.A.A.F. There is some attempt
to fulfil the logic of the characterisation
when Jean, with a child which might be
either Kevin’s or Garth’s, causes Garth’s
dismissal and is finally rejected by him,
but this is unsatisfactory; it seems like
a last-minute change of direction, for
clearly it was not the novelist’s original
intention to show Garth destroyed by
Jean or even, so cheaply and mechani-
cally, destroyed by Kevin.
One suspects that I Camp Here was
written in war-time, and that the author
was misled by war-time sentiment into
changing her original purposes. The
events of the concluding sections of the
novel could, conceivably, occur ; but they
do not happen inevitably, from the un-
erring development of character, as events
should occur in a work of art. Since the
war undoubtedly broke the pattern of
many Australian lives, the feeble con-
clusion may make the book accurate as
a social document; but artistically it is
wholly a mistake. Instead of working
out her drama to its inevitable climax the
novelist descends to following her people
from day to day in an existence without
pattern, without form, without artistic
meaning. The effect is rather as if Esther
Roland had begun to write The Fortunes
of Richard Mahony or Dombey and Son
and had ended by writing the day-to-day
radio serial of “The Lawsons.”
Still, Dickens himself made similar
mistakes ; Dombey and Son, in fact, falls
to pieces after the death of Paul. In spite
of the failure at the end, Esther Roland
has written a novel of genuine merit. She
may do well. And, if it is important that
city novels should be written —as indeed
it is, though they do nos have to be ex-
clusively concerned with the slums —it is
undeniably a pleasant change to be taken
on to broad pastures among horses, cattle,
sheep, dogs, rabbits and wallabies and
people recognisably Australian.
Lament for a Long Night.
It is a lonely thing
To wake at night and lie
Watching the stars’ white fires
Cold in the waste of sky
That is grey beyond the black roof.
Hearing the wind that blows
Through all the space between
With keen and deathly sound
From the high ridge of snows ;
And swelling up through the ground
The dark voice of the sea
That cast us on this shore.
That will let us pass no more
To the land where we would be.
Blind miles of foreign coast,
Huts of an alien race —
No home but you, beloved.
No home for me in this place.
And you, though your body sleeps
By mine, walk far and free
Where I cannot, would not, come —
Some green glen loved in the years
Before you met grief and me.
Would not —for there, what tears
From my bursting heart must rise
If you turned to my voice that cried —
Ah, turned from a stranger’s side /
With blank, unwelcoming eyes.
But if I, too. could sleep —
Far off, yet still in sight,
At the end of that long black tunnel,
Tiny and jewel-bright,
The firelit room, the faces
That would watch for me though I were
dead —
Oh, far and warm and clear.
My father’s chair, his knee
Where I could lean my head.
But with bleak stars and salt sea
Till I sleep or you wake I lie,
Hear the wind through chill space hurled
And no one in all the world
Is lonelier than I.

NAN McDONALD.
A Prince of Arabia.
A first glance at the title-page of A
Prince of Arabia by George Stitt (Allen
and Unwin) may cause surprise that a
Royal Navy commander should be writ-
ing the biography of an Emir of Mecca.
But the British Navy, after the First
World War, with battleships based in the
Bosporus off Stamboul, and at Alex-
andria, and with gunboats and destroyers
constantly patrolling Yemen's coast and
the Persian Gulf, has for years been
closely in touch with the Arab kingdom.
The book is the diary of Ali Haider,
Emir of Mecca, direct descendant of
Mohammed the Prophet, translated by
his English wife and sent to their friend
the commander for editing and comment.
Its intimate disclosures of the maze of
intrigue and power politics at the Turkish
Sultan’s court make Clapham Junction
seem like a billiard-table in comparison.
Though the diary, extensively quoted,
has little literary merit and fails to
characterise clearly, the commander s
commentary enlarges on it satisfactorily ;
and diary and comment follow smoothly.
Ali Haider resembles Robert Graves s
Claudius in many respects. Peace-loving,
devout and honest, secure in his unchal-
lengeable right to the holy Emirate of
Mecca, he holds aloof from the ferment
of suspicion and intrigue attending ap-
pointment to Mecca’s governorship ; this
probably accounts for his dying a natural
death in 1935. Like Claudius, he was no
fool, and all his life urged his country s
close friendship with Great Britain—
again, a natural result of his contact with
its Navy.
An interesting chapter deals with the
accession and corrupt reign of Sultan
Abdul Hamid—the infamous Abdul the
Damned. Though All's grandfather had
recently been deposed as Emir of Mecca,
Abdul the Damned still held the dis-
tinguished descendant of the Prophet in
great veneration, and, so far as he trusted
anybody, trusted him. As a result, young
Ali was brought to Stamboul and edm
cated with the Sultan’s sons. He lived m
the Imperial palace, in intimate, and
sometimes dangerous, touch with all the
intrigues, stranglings, treachery and sus-
picions which were to reduce the country
to a state where life was intolerable:
The system of espionage had developed
to such an extent that if three Turkish
subjects were seep together one at least
would be certain to be a spy. Suspicion
bred fear, and fear bred hate, with the
result that those with whom he had even
the slightest disagreement soon found
themselves objects of his [Abdul s] hate
and insatiable cruelty. The slightest men-
tion of reform roused in him a fury of
passion, and those who had placed him on
the throne as a reformer were now to re-
ceive the full blast of his suspicious and
treacherous nature.
If Ali Haider needed further incentive
to remain clear of politics, this atmos-
phere supplied it. Throughout Abdul the
Damned’s reign, the inevitable revolt and
his deposition, the Prophet’s descendant,
virtually a prisoner, waited patiently for
his call to Mecca. .
He blames Great Britain in large mea-
sure for failure of the popular revolt to
lift Turkey from its morass of tyrannical
misrule: — .
The Young Turks bad set up as their
model the Parliament of Great Britain,
they had sent a deputation to London to
enter into friendly relation with the Gov-
ernment, and they looked to England for
support in their efforts to establish a demo-
cratic constitution. But England’s states-
men failed to grasp the realities behind the
situation, and looked upon the efforts of
the Young Turks in a patronising and half-
cynical manner. Germany was not slew to
take advantage of Britain’s shortsighted
diplomacy, and Britain lost an opportunity
for which she was to pay so dearly six
years later.
Perhaps so, but when the wild
promises of the Young Turks failed to
materialise the result was dissatisfaction
with the new regime; this produced op-
pression where freedom had been
promised, intolerance when tolerance
was so badly needed. And drove the
Emir to admit that “the granting of
political autonomy is a gift that can only
be given by wise and experienced ad-
ministrators” —an admission which holds
a peculiar appositeness today.
Then came the Great War, and with it
the Arab revolt, fanned by T. E.
Lawrence. When the news was flashed
to Stamboul and the Cabinet immedi-
ately deposed Hussein —the ruling Mec-
can Emir —Ali Haider knew he was faced
with the supremp moment of his life:
official recognition of his hereditary
rights. Offered the Emirate, he accepted
at once, and soon after sailed for the
holy city.
From mid-1916 to 1921 Ali Haider
precariously held his throne, beset by all
the tortuous trickeries he had himself
witnessed in Stamboul. Finally, to favor
Britain and Lawrence’s war-time ally,
Hussein, Ali Haider was summarily de-
posed. He returned to his life of com-
parative insignificance in Stamboul.
On the events of the next two years—
-1921-23 —culminating as they did in the
advent of Moustapha Kemal and the
resurrection of Turkey as a strong and
independent State, the diarist is unfor-
tunately reticent. He spent the rest of
his life travelling in Syria, Egypt and
Arabia, but, though always venerated as
Mohammed’s descendant, never regained
his Emirate.
The book is full of human interest and
drama, providing a topical background to
the growth of Arab nationalism, and
Commander Stitt controls the action into
a clear and direct narrative.

Dear Red Page, , . TT
Don’t you think your hatred ot Hem-
ingway is getting a little out of hand?
Anybody who uses more than one short
sentence a page is sure to be accused of
imitating him, sooner or later, but I don t
think he’d like being blamed for me, as
he was in your review of Jon Cleary s
You Can’t See Round Corners (R.P
4/8/ ’48).
Anyway, he can’t be to blame for me
if all the things of which you accuse him
and his “school” are true. I certainly
have characters called Bill, and some-
times Tom, but they are not cynical, don
wisecrack, aren’t perverts, and don t kill
anybody or commit any brutal crimes.
The nearest one of them ever got to
murder was being an accessory slight y
after the fact, and he found himself m
that position through sheer weakness and
vanity, not toughness. There was a very
tough character who did the killing, but
I don’t believe anybody mistook him toi
the “hero.”
It is really time you re-read me, pre-
ferably buying new copies instead ot
using old ones or borrowing from the
library. You may be very bored with
Bill or Tom, but you really won t find
them shooting, swaggering, buUtignting,
fornicating, wisecracking, or wallowing in
blood, though in Downhill Is Easier a
bloke called Reg instead of Bill or Tom
develops from being a rather boasti
and unstable type into a hardworking
citizen with responsibilities. I don t g
in for “man the heroic” because tn
creature is rather hard to find, but accord-
ing to such lights as I have I try to
portray mostly decent, honest Australians
who are fond of beer and their mates,
and get in and out of trouble as quit
few Australians do.
Incidentally, I thought You Cant S
Round Corners an excellent book abou
one man in one set of circumstances not
a typical anything. And if low types lik
Hemingway, Weidmann, Cleary an
myself have done such a disservice t
literature on both sides of fi
might it not be because those who hav
seen the light spend all their time yelli g
about what a disgrace our murky corn
is instead of writing the books
would expose the falsity of our approach
GAVIN S. CASEY.
Neither Gavin Casey nor Jon '"
the review of You Can’t See Rmmd_Comer
was accused of imitating Hemingway.

Information Sought.
Who was the “Sea-green Incor-
ruptible” and how did the name
originate ?
A name applied to Robespierre by
Carlyld in his French Revolution.
According to Hilaire Belloc’s intro-
duction to this work in Everyman’s
Library, 1906, “ ‘Sea Green’ is based
on one phrase of Mme. de Stacks
misread. What Mme. de Stael said
was that the prominent veins m
Robespierre’s forehead showed
greenish-blue against his hair and
somewhat pale skin. But his com-
plexion was healthy and his expres-
sion, if anything, winning.”

(1) Methods employed by fakers o'
old paintings? (2) What methods are
adopted by scientists to detect such
forgeries ?
(1) The most common frauds are
the painting of a composite of figures
and draperies copied from old mas-
ters’ known paintings, or the copying
of some famous painter exactly, the
buyer being assured that the master
painted several replicas of it. . (2)
Tiny spots of paint are sometimes
extracted from the painting with a
hollow needle. These are examined
under the microscope and submitted
to chemical analysis. It is thus pos-
sible to determine whether the paints
correspond to those used at the time
of the old master. Another method
is by use of X- or ultra-violet-rays.
Very often the faker paints over an
old painting of no merit so as to get
a genuinely ancient basis. X-rays
show up any picture on the canvas
over which a later picture has been
painted. Photo-micrographs of the
brush-strokes are also helpful.

Details of the first plane to cross
the English Channel?
The monoplane Bleriot XI, driven
by a 25-h.p. Anzani engine, and
piloted by Louis Bleriot, flew the
Channel from France to England m
1909. The framework of the machine
was oak and poplar, spliced and re-
inforced with piano-wire; 22ft. m
length, weighed 471 b., and would
stand a 6001 b. load. The chassis
weighed 601 b., including the wheels,
and the speed was estimated at 36
m.p.h.

What was the Cato-street con-
spiracy ?
A plot by Arthur Thistlewood
(1770-1820), who had developed revo-
lutionary sympathies as a result of
reading Paine’s works and of visits
to France and America, and some 30
other persons in 1820. The con-
spirators proposed to murder the
Ministers of the Crown at a Cabinet
dinner, and claimed that they were
provoked by the repressive measures
taken by the Government against the
advocates of reform. They met in a
stable in Cato-street, near the
Edgware-road, London. The con-
spiracy was exposed and the leaders
executed.

How to get rid of slaters, ground
aphis and red spider in the vegetable
garden ?
For slaters make a bait of blood-
and-bone fertiliser (eight parts) and
arsenate of lead or Paris green (one
part) and place it in tins or pots near
attacked plants; keep the mixture
away from fowls and animals. Wheie
plant-lice is noticeable get rid of
all decaying rubbish and treat the
area with powdered naphthalene or
a mixture of equal parts of lime and
tobacco-dust. Red spider can be con-
trolled by applying derris-dust freely
or spraying with lime-sulphur (trade
strength), making certain to treat the
underside of the leaves where pest
breeds. Avoid overhead watering
during treatment.

What are the Pulitzer prizes and
after whom are they named?
Annual prizes confined to American
citizens and offered in the interests
of letters (American history and
biography, poetry, drama and novel-
writing), music, and good newspaper
work. The amount of the prizes is
about $14,500. They were established
under the will of Joseph Pulitzer, a
Hungarian by birth, who settled in
America, and was one of the chief
founders of American sensational
journalism, first in the St. Louis
“Post-Despatch,” which he acquired
in 1878, and then in the New York
“World,” which he took over in
1883.

BLAC K BOY
BY
STANDBY
HE moved slowly along the river
bank, a lonely, rather pathetic
little black figure. It could not
be said that he walked; indeed,
he seemed scarcely to move. Occasionally
one bare black foot advanced a few
inches beyond the other, but mostly he
just stood. Only by watching him closely
could one detect any actual progress.
His age would be about eight years.
His skin was black—that dead, sooty
black with no gleam of copper showing
through—and his eyes were deep, sombre
brown. It was difficult to see those eyes
because he wore a brown felt hat at
least two sizes too big for him. It rested
on his ears, forcing them downwards
and out, producing the effect of a kelpie
pup when he first tries to prick his
ears. There was something dog-like about
his eyes, too —soft,' dark and wonderfully
expressive.
He wore a pair of short grey pants
and a bright blue shirt with the sleeves
unbuttoned and flapping around his
skinny black wrists. A schoolbag dangled
like an airman’s parachute over the seat
of his pants, the straps sagging so far
down over his shoulders that only the
bend of his arms saved them from falling
right off.
WATCHING him from the door of
his hut Old Ben Armitage was
frankly puzzled. If the kid was on his way
to school it would be lunch-time before he
got there, judging by his present rate of
progress, for Old Ben’s hut was away
down river, almost on the edge of the
mangrove swamp and a full mile from
the school.
The kid wasn’t just sulking, Ben saw.
It wasn’t simply a case of “the' schoolboy
creeping like a snail unwillingly to
school.” Ben knew his Shakspeare and he
knew a lot about kids, black and white.
This youngster was not consciously going
anywhere. He might have been in a
trance except that he showed occasional
flashes of animation.
In spite of the hampering straps his
arms moved in strange gestures or poses
quite meaningless to Old Ben. After each
of these movements the kid bounded into
the air, clapped his black hands together
and flashed his teeth in a delighted grin.
Then slowly, almost imperceptibly, the
crawling progress was resumed.
“Off his rocker,” Old Ben decided and
went inside to wash his breakfast dishes,
THE next morning and each morning
for the rest of the week it was the
same. Old Ben found himself hurrying
through his breakfast so that he could be
out on his verandah when the kid passed.
The crawling pace never quickened, the
bag hung always at its precarious limit,
but gestures varied. Sometimes the boy
faced the river and went through a series
of complicated pantomimes that com-
pletely puzzled Ben. And yet there was
something vaguely familiar about them;
they stirred memories in the old man’s
brain. Stranger still, the kid seemed never
to notice him. Once, when only a few
feet separated the two. Old Ben greeted
the boy with a casual “Good-day.”
The deep brown eyes regarded the old
man solemnly for a moment and then,
without a word or the flicker of a smile,
the youngster moved on.
OLD BEN made inquiries and dis-
covered the boy’s name was Armit.
He lived, of course, “Down River” —in
the little collection of shacks where white
derelicts and the colored people-
Kanakas and Malays mostly—were
housed. Armit was new to the town, and
lived with his mother in a fairly typical
shack of driftwood and rusted iron.
Old Ben could talk to the natives. Years
spent working the reefs for trochus in his
own lugger with a crew of native boys
had made him more at home with them
than with his own people.
A strange character, Old Ben, a man
who had made big money in his day,
who knew every reef on the Queensland
coast from the Torres Strait down to the
sprawling treacherous mass of the Swain
Reefs, and who was content to end his
days in a galvanised-iron hut on the bank
of a mosquito-infested tidal river. He had
not drunk himself into poverty, for no
one had ever known him take more than
one or two beers. His tall thin figure
was always neatly dressed in clean khakis.
He shaved every morning, but, except
when he went up town for stores, he
never wore boots. Looking at those
brown sprawling feet you felt that they
should never be imprisoned. His long,
rather horse-like face was deeply lined
and weathered. Although he lived in the
tropics he never wore a hat, so that the
tight-stretched skin of his bald dome had
the appearance and texture of well-
polished leather.
Armit’s father, Ben learned, was a
Torres Strait Islander and his mother a
full-blooded abo. gin from Arnhem Land.
The lady was known as Clara. She was
very black, exceedingly ugly and enorm-
ously fat except for her legs, which showed
like two dried black sticks beneath her
tight - stretched cotton frock. One
wondered how those legs, so typically
aboriginal, could support the huge bloated
body. Old Ben remembered seeing her
once or twice as she waddled past his
place on her way up-town. She had been
smoking a short-stemmed pipe, its bowl
as black as her own face. She smoked it
now as she sat in her doorway chatting
amiably with her visitor.
“Father b’long Armit,” she informed
him, “bin lugger-boy, trochus-fishin’ longa
reef.” He had acquired a share in a
lugger together with five other Torres
Strait boys, she went on to explain. She
and Armit had come down from their
island home on the lugger and were to
live here while her man worked the more
southerly reefs.
J T was all one to Clara, who didn’t care
I where she lived so long as she was not
asked to work in return for food and
tobacco. But Armit, born and reared on
a small, reef-fringed island, did not take
kindly to civilisation. For the first time
in his young life he had to wear clothes.
He had to go to school and there, since
he was completely untaught, sit with boys
who were little more than babies and
white babies at that. Clara could neither
read nor write. Armit was even more
handicapped, for he knew only the barest
smattering of English.
He could swim like a turtle and, al-
though too young to take part in the
hunt, knew exactly how a turtle should
“I warned that boy he'd he using his shanghai once too often!”
be speared and hauled into a canoe. He
could handle his own small canoe like an
expert, was moderately accurate with a
bow and arrow and had even speared a
few small fish. If he could have explained
these things to the small boys of his own
age he would probably have become a
hero instead of the object of their con-
tempt. But that, of course, never occurred
to him.
“Armit bin proper shy fella,” Clara in-
formed her visitor indulgently.
Old Ben nodded and wandered off
down to the water’s edge. He found
Armit on an exposed mud flat, apparently
absorbed in the drill-like manoeuvres of
a colony of soldier-crabs. Studying the
youngster carefully he could see no trace
of the Torres Strait Islander, The fea-
tures, the skinny legs and the dull black
coloring were purely aboriginal. Reach-
ing out Old Ben removed the all-en-
veloping brown hat. Instead of the
straight, straggling hair of the aboriginal,
Armit’s hair was definitely crinkled —a
sure sign of the island breed.
“By cripes,” Ben said. “You fair
dinkum island boy all right.”
Armit snatched back his hat, jammed
it down on top of his ears and went on
with his study of the crabs.
As he walked back to his hut Old Ben
felt quite pleased about that hair. Ben
didn’t like abos—get them away from
land and they were useless, he said. But
the Torres Strait boys were born seamen.
BEN watched for the boy again on
Monday morning and grinned with
pleasure when the small figure came into
sight. Over the week-end he had formed
a theory about his strange behavior, and
he was anxious to put it to the test. Be-
fore Armit passed from his view he knew
that he was right. The upward extending
of the left arm always coincided with the
flight overhead of a gull. The delighted
applause was the hunter’s joy at a good
shot. Armit never looked at the gull once
he had released his imaginary arrow ; his
eyes travelled downwards, following the
fall of a mortally-wounded bird. When
he stood facing the river the bow was
discarded for a fish-spear. Should the
flash of a leaping fish show, the small
black arm shot forward. And Armit the
hunter never missed.
Old Ben saw it all now. This was no
lonely schoolboy yearning for the com-
panionship of the white boys of this
town. He had no need of them. He lived
in a world of his own, a .world of turtle,
dugong and fish of every color. The river
bank was a reef edge and he was Armit
the hunter.
On Tuesday he speared and landed a
turtle. Watching him from his verandah
Old Ben was amazed at the perfection of
the pantomime. The small figure poised
in the attitude of a spear-thrower a few
feet from the water’s edge. Suddenly a
mullet leaped, gleamed silver in the morn-
ing sunshine for a split-second and fell
back into the water with a loud plop.
In that split-second the hunter launched
his heavy spear, hurling himself forward
to add weight to the weapon. Obviously
this was no slender fish-spear but the
long, heavy harpoon used for hunting
turtle or dugong. Next the hunter seized
the light harpoon line, letting it slip
through his fingers until the quarry was
exhausted and then hauling steadily in.
The whole scene was realistically enacted,
right to the end when the exhausted turtle
yvas rolled over on his back, there to wave
impotent flappers in the air.
Each morning, for the rest of the week,
Ben watched the boy, never once attempt-
ing to speak. Any advances on his part,
he well knew, would be met with that
fixed, stony stare —and silence.
OLD BEN had been watching him for
a fortnight before he heard him
speak. The morning was gloriously fine
—one of those soft spring mornings when
the tide is at its full and the smooth sur-
face of the river reflects the sky so faith-
fully that one must bend over it, breaking
the reflection, to see down through its
cool, clear green depths.

Dizzy Love-song.
The house be a house
On a hill high high,
And the house be a-white.
And the hill green green,
And so-blue be the cloudless sky.
The house be the house
Where my love love stay.
And my heart be a-song
As I climb that way.
Singing ho-diddle, hi-diddle, hey.
The house be a house
With a swing swing gate.
And I go through the gate
With my heart leap leap,
To the door where my love love wait.

The End of Exploring.
See! Down the red road by the,brown tree
The gate leans wide like morning. Here’s
winter’s green;
Here are summer’s bleached affairs, and
here between
Rain-work and wind-work the road winds
free.
The shed is slabbed with shimmer.
Fence-posts go
Hill-high for shadows. Ben’s on his bright
chain :
And it’s the dog’s limit, the green cock’s
strain ;
And the road lies hard and open towards
the snow.
But why go? The time waits deep for
summer
With the grain, for the ringed shade and
sheep
Cropping the silence while the swagmen
sleep
Though on the height the ice-etched
symbols glimmer.
And the road ? Go then ; and, smothered
in the snow,
Or on the violet ridge where the ice trees
burn,
Trust to your lucky heart you may return
With love to dog-bark, gate and sweet
cockcrow.

Se’nnight to Fortnight.
Some day, old friend, you’ll join me in
the shades
And we shall wander in those twilit
glades
Where haunt the spirits of forgotten
words.
Lost languages, and cries of extinct
birds ;
Your end approaches, you have heard the
call.
Screw up your courage to the final pawl,
You can’t avert the inevitable day
When Englishmen will pass you by and
say
“Two weeks,” as men do in the U.S.A.
To show their independence and a token
To teach the world how English should
be spoken
And then, old colleague, hand in hand
we’ll go.
In print a jest, in speech a curio,
Like two old ladies in this motor age
Stiffly enthroned in their old equipage,
Sedately ambling down the gaping street
With coachman, groom and parasoh
complete.

The Cactus of the Moon.
The cactus of the moon blooms only foi
one night ;
Quivering and shivering its petals open
slow
Alive with queer delight —
Petals that shudder and grow
Thin, tendril-like and white
To shine in the moon’s light.
It will not bloom again, her own mosi
lovely flower.
Dawn wind, bright day intruding net
domain
Make secret bliss turn sour.
This negative of pain
Must perish within the hour.
No sun shall have the power
To stay, a moment even, love’s perfect
sign.
Softly the milky petals dco-op and fold
Into a shroud so fine
That when I am old
I’ll weep I saw love live, laugh and decline
Before I guessed the truth and made it
mine.

BERLIN BUNGLE.
Before concluding that all
hands have been fairly rearin’
fo go in Berlin it might be as
well to check up on some of the
statements on the issue being
aired overseas.
A fair sampling of these
shows a very widespread shrink-
ing from any idea of a scrap,
along with considerable doubt
on the rightness of the Western
side’s position. France, in par-
ticular, is generally shown as a
most reluctant dragon.
Visiting France, N. Y.
“Times” manager Edwin L.
James reports the French as
quite prepared to believe that
in the discussed fight the U.S.
would win in the long run: “But
what happens to France in the
meanwhile?” James reports:
“The French point out that their
army is weak, the British and
American armies in Europe are
insufficient and the Soviet army
is strong. France is just recover-
ing from one occupation, and
the French do not wish another,
which they think would be much
worse than the German occupa-
tion. They say frankly it might
be an experience from which
France would never recover, re-
gardless of the final outcome.”*
Even the atom bomb doesn’t
carry much weight with the
French: it might win in the
end, but it would not save them
from a tough time. Altogether,
“the French have little enthusi-
asm for what they regard as
perhaps the somewhat too posi-
tive positions of the Americans
and the British in the Berlin
situation.” In fact, the bulk of
them hold that the Western side
might well find it best to quit
Berlin: “It is not that the
French wish to lose face, but the
idea is that if their staying in
Berlin increases the danger of
the Russians going to war, they
would quit Berlin —or do almost
anything else”
Another N. Y. “Times”
correspondent points out that
the French, who in 1939 had 100
effective divisions, now have
only about five in Europe. “The
French,” says a Washington
“Post” correspondent, “wonder
if the United States has taken
into account the hazards of its
German policy” ; they point out
that the U.S. and Britain “do
not have the resources in man-
power to buttress a failure” of
their “provocative policy.”
It does not add up to a much-
worth-while ally for a fight; and,
more remarkably, some Ameri-
can reports cast doubt on Britain
in the same role. They state
that, for all the high words,
rumors keep leaking out of con-
siderable division in British
Government quarters on the
whole Berlin stand.
The ultra-nationalistic N. Y.
“Daily News” sees the British,
French and Benelux leaders as
“apparently frightened half to
death of Stalin” and “trying to
placate him in any way they
can.”
But what goes for these goes
also for America —by far the
most important consideration,
since Uncle Sam would, to com-
mit an understatement, have the
major role. The most striking
thing about American expres-
sions of opinion on the issue,
as gathered from recent air-
mails, is the very evident re-
versal from the position taken
earlier.
Even the blessed word “ap-
peasement”—on which Britain
and France have been continu-
ously berated ever since Munich
—crops up in the thinnest dis-
guise. For example, N. Y.
“Times” military writer Hanson
W. Baldwin stating: “We must
concede, as well as expect con-
cessions” ; or David Lawrence,
in N. Y. “Sun,” stating “it is in-
credible that the diplomats....
—Chicago “News.”
THE GREAT TUMBLING ACT.
cannot find some new way or re-
vive some old way to negotiate
a settlement.”
In a long comparing of the
respective military forces of the
U.S. and Russia, Baldwin gives
figures calculated to put the
wind up even less reluctant
warriors than the French (on
this issue). Baldwin shows the
Western forces on or near the
spot to be quite puny compared
to the Russian forces, which he
puts at upwards of half a mil-
lion in the German, Polish and
Danubian areas, plus “hundreds
of thousands of soldiers of the
satellite armies” and “consider-
ably more than 1,000,000 Soviet
troops in direct support of
the occupied countries.”
Baldwin (here quoted as typi-
cal of the more careful line of
viewpoint lately noted in the
U.S.) admits that “a world-wide
basis of comparison presents
quite a different picture,” and
“in such a comparison the
United States has a great and
clear-cut lead at sea” and other
advantages, among them the
atom bomb: “In sum, it seems
clear that total American (and
Allied) strength is considerably
superior to total Russian (and
satellite) strength, but that much
of our strength is potential and
much of the Russian strength is
represented by the cold, hard,
sharp arguments of tanks and
guns and soldiers. The Russians,
moreover, have the advantage of
geography and propinquity.”
Reams of comment in much
the same tone have come along
in recent air-mails, reading like
a definite putting-on of the
brakes, Baldwin himself con-
cludes with the view that “in
Berlin we are in an indefensible
strategic position, ag well as in
an uncertain political position.”
As another merely typical ex-
ample, Walter Lippmann, in
N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” has
contended: “The price of peace
with honor is to recede from a
position to which we were
spectacularly committed —from
the German policy which Mr,
Bevin and Mr. Marshall
adopted, and imposed on Mr.
Bidault, at the London confer-
ence which ended early in June.”
Lippmann further pictures
“Mr. Bevin leading the retreat”
from the position on Germany
taken up by the Western side in
London ; but any reading of the
American press over the past
few months will show that that
is merely passing the buck.
Actually, Berlin has been a
considerable bungle right from
the beginning. The weakness of
the Western position is that,
though all sorts of things were
promised and agreed to, there is
nothing on paper to show it!
Scripps-Howard foreign edi-
tor William Philip Simms states
that the agreements for the oc-
cupation of Berlin (each of the
four Powers taking a specified
zone) “do not expressly provide
for corridors to and from the
capital,” and further says:
“Just why this strange lapse oc-
curred is not clear. One report
has it that the late U.S. Am-
bassador John C. Winant, as
representative on the European
Advisory Commission, did not
think an agreement on corridors
was necessary, and that Presi-
dent Roosevelt concurred with
him when the State Depart-
ment noted the omission.”
“U.S. News and World Report”
(also among those very doubtful
about the Western position)
points out that, though “the
large portion of German terri-
tory once in American hands
was turned over to the Russians
[at the time of Germany’s de-
feat] as part of the price of get-
ting U.S. troops into Berlin,”
when the Russians did eventu-
ally permit the U.S. and British
troops to enter Berlin by that
arrangement “no written guaran-
tee was given of unrestricted
entry into the German capital.”
The publication further states
on this most important point:
“Basic agreement on Berlin
came on June 29, 1945, when
General Clay and the other dele-
gates of the Western Powers ac-
cepted the plan for transport
‘corridors’ to Berlin. Opera-
tional-control and supervision of
land and waterway traffic was
left to the Russians. The
Americans assumed the right of
free entry, but the agreement
was entirely oral. The Russians
signed nothing. U.S. and British
troops, on the basis of this oral
agreement, withdrew from the
Soviet zone and the troops of
the Western Powers went into
Berlin.”
On that showing, the Western
side would appear to be in palp-
ably a weak legal position on
which to take a final stand, and
these counsels of caution
strongly emphasise that that goes
also for the military position:
“It is unlikely that the West will
ever be much weaker than it is
now.”
Russia’s Price.
As summarised from “U.S.
News and World Report,” the
Russian price for an agreement
on Berlin has amounted to the
following demands:
A centralised Germany, run
from Berlin, with Communists
high in the Government.
Delivery of all reparations
Moscow claims to be due from
Western Germany.
Inclusion of Russia in the in-
ternational control of the Ruhr.
Abandonment by the West of
current plans for unifying the
three Western zones in a sepa-
rate State, governed from Frank-
furt, but tied to Western Europe.
Withdrawal of Western Ger-
many from the European Re-
covery Programme.
“For that price, Moscow says,
the world can have peace in Ger-
many, including Berlin. And the
occupation troops of the Big
Four can then return home.”
The quoted U.S. publication,
which has insisted all along that
there would be no war over
Berlin and has favored continued
negotiations on the lines of the
latest attempts in Moscow, says
mildly of the Soviet-demand list
that “it doesn’t look like a very
good bargain for the West.”
Actually, it would mean (1)
Russian control of Germany;
(2) disruption of the European
Recovery Programme ; (3) block-
ing of recovery in Western
Europe ; (4) U.S. and British re-
treat from the Continent.
And people who can’t mention
Munich without nearly having a
fit are all for it!
Nationalised Bull.
A boast to voters by Mr.
Aneurin Bevan being quoted in
the American press;
“When we face you again [at
the general election in 1950]
with all of our programme
carried out —all of it, and I
mean that steel is to be added—
we are going to establish a new
record ; that of being the only
British Government that carried
out all of its election promises.”
The point in it that some
American quarters are chewing
oyer is whether they should help
so handsomely in keeping in
power a political party whose
policies are so directly opposed
to their own.
The argument in those
American quarters is that Britain
has a perfect right to do as it
likes with itself—and the U.S.
has a perfect right to do as it
likes with its dollars.
Somersault Act.
Taken generally, about the
most consistent element of
American foreign policy for
some time has been that of
marked agility on the somersault
board.
It has been shown most spec-
tacularly over Palestine, but
there have also been agile shill-
ings over such issues as making
Trieste an international port
(changed to handing it back to
Italy, where it belongs), and
ostracising Franco (changed to
undercover recognition of him
and assistance to Spain; in ex-
change, it has been reported, for
rights to air-bases).
Also, dramatic changes of
U.S. (and hence Western) policy
in Germany have been freely
predicted by close observers of
the Washington scene, and
N. Y. “Times” chief European
correspondent C. L. Sulzberger
sees further shifts pending in the
whole Middle East, these really
amounting to a necessary con-
tinuation of the Palestine acro-
batic act.
As Sulzberger reports, prior
to the birth of Israel, United
States policy had been crystallis-
ing slowly into one of promoting
friendly relationships with the
Moslem States of the region.
This had been done in order to
protect and expand the United
States 9 petroleum development
under private aegis and to pre-
pare the way for obtaining air-
base rights and other strategic
advantages. “Middle Eastern
oil was calculated as a vital raw-
material necessity in the matur-
ing of the European Recovery
Programme as well as an im-
mediate supply for United
States naval and air force re-
quirements, permitting the hus-
banding of the shrinking re-
sources of Western wells.” But
“The gradual unfolding of a
parallel pro-Zionist policy in
Washington for idealistic, senti-
mental and political reasons has
worked against this original and
basically strategical trend.”
In Sulzberger’s view Uncle
Sam has lost both ways on that
deal: “Washington has lost
considerable influence in the
Arab world, where the United
States is regarded as a pro-
Zionist whipping-boy. Simul-
taneously, it has not gained
sufficient compensatory influence
in the fledgling State of Israel.
Reporting further that United
States Army planes are now
stationed in Nicosia, Cyprus, for
the possible necessity of evacu-
ating United States citizens
from Arab countries should
angry mobs menace them, the
correspondent concludes that the

necessity of “a positive and care-
fully-calculated United States
policy to meet the new situa-
tion occasioned by Israel’s exist-
ence is therefore evident. This
applies both in Israel and in the
Arab States.”
With both Arabs and Jews
(from different causes or senti-
ments) turning to Moscow, and
the Communist group in
Palestine reported (by Sulzberger
and others) to be gaining
strength, and with, above all,
vitally-needed oil in the balance,
.-it looks as if Uncle Sam will
have to be getting in some solid
practice as a lightning-change
artist as well as acrobat.
Grilled Wallace.
Authoress Rebecca West, in
N. Y. “Herald Tribune,” after
listening to a much-publicised
U.S. Presidential candidate at
th e Philadelphia convention
which nominated him and his
team-mate, Senator Glen Taylor:
“Mr. Wallace is a bad speaker.
He has a large and spongy voice
that hangs in a mass in the air
without attempting to make
progress to the ear.”
On another aspect of the
same: “Mr. Wallace himself is
not Communist-controlled in a
certain sense. Ido not think he
obeys specific instructions as to
what to say and do. But
obviously the Communists
control him as one controls a
mass of gaseous vapor when
one enfolds it in a skin and
allows it to be itself within those
limits when one wants a balloon
to go up.”
Turning to those who listen to
the Oracle, the writer puts a
special point on her quill, with
a much wider application than
the particular Wallace conven-
tion she attended. She notes the
sentimentalising of the gather-
ing on the familiar ground that
it consisted largely of young
people, and comments on some
of them: “There were the ones
who were embryo Babbitts, hav-
ing their fling before they settled
down to safe and narrow lives,
stupid young people, too stupid
to understand how the world is
run and that the present system,
for all its faults, took a great deal
of patient and intelligent effort,
and who therefore wrote off the
whole of the past with a sneer;
and who were so smug that they
saw their own sneering as
idealism.
“There were others who wore
on their faces the signs of a
more serious maladjustment. I
never saw so many girls with the
restless look on their faces that
comes of profound insecurity, of
consciousness that neither their
physical nor mental resources
were adequate and that they
must create a personality some-
how, by revolt if nothing else
turned up. X never saw so many
boys with the sullen eyes and the
dropped chins which mean a
brain just good enough to grasp
the complexities of life and to
realise that it would never be
able to master them.”
In fact. Youth Department,
Communist Line ; address, Any-
hall. Anywhere.
But Americans would regard
Miss West as quite gentle and
polite. Rougher male colleagues
of the press columns served up
much more robust fare on the
same subject. Thus, one of the
more restrained of them —
George E. Sokolsky, in N. Y.
“Sun”: —
“The hysteria over nothing in
Philadelphia, the holy-roller
singing of doggerel, the repeti-
tion of the words ‘China and
Greece,’ the Tower-of-Babel-like
rhythm of sounds with only
emotional content —this is the
pattern of the mob, driven by
fear or hunger or passion, or
just driven because it wants to
be driven.”
Commenting that “Of such
stuff are mass movements made,”
Sokolsky further depicts the
whole outfit:
“The essence of this move-
ment is Soviet Russia. This was
clear not only in the set speeches
but in the ugly roar of the mob.
These same people persecuted
the Bund, the Christian Front,
the Ku Klux Klan. Had anyone
done for Hitler what they are
doing for Stalin they would
have organised lynching parties.
Yet there is no difference be-
tween them either in spirit or in
purpose The mob always re-
acts with the same hysteria. And
it never knows its direction, ex-
cept that it hates.
“The new party is in the ser-
vice of Soviet Russia. It attacks
indiscriminately every American
who is not. in the sernoe of
Soviet Russia. It attacks Tru-
man, Dewey, Dulles, Vanden-
—Washington "Post.”
THE NEW LOOK.
berg, Marshall, Forrestal, Gen.
Draper, Gen. Clay—the list is
long, but it is indiscriminate.
The speeches closely followed
the line on foreign and domestic
policies of the ‘Daily Worker’
and the ‘New Times,’ a weekly
publication issued in Moscow
and circulating in four
languages, including English, in
the United States.
“These Wallaceites are not
Communists, because to be an
avowed Communist requires
conviction and courage and a
religious faith. The Wallaceites
are not of such stock ; they are
rather like the swooning adu-
lators of Rudolph Valentino or
Frank Sinatra ; they are rather
masochists who revel in their
umbrages; they are rather like
those mystics who follow Father
Divine. Unhappy, clutching to
their disabilities, this is their
outlet. This new party for a
moment frees their souls from
an imprisonment of their own
making. They shriek; they
shout; their eyes shine fanatic-
ally. They are masters of power.
Then they sink back to nursing
their griefs.
“Lenin never organised such
into a force, but Hitler did. For
them Lenin had only contempt,
and over them he established
what he called a dictatorship of
the proletariat, held in a trustee-
ship by an oligarchy of his own
devising. Dr. Sun Yat-sen
recognised their menace, and he
organised China into a state of
‘tutelage,’ as he called it, with
the Kuomintang as trustee and
tutor. Kemal Pasha ignored
them and frightened them. But
Mussolini and Hitler welded
them into a force which both
dominated, each in his own
country, by hypnotic oratory
and mannerisms. And both
brought their countries to
destruction.”
In N. Y. “Daily News” John
O’Donnell described the outfit
more tersely: “the crooks,
shysters, goons, screwballs,
foreign agents, etc., who as-
sembled in Philadelphia for the
pathological frenzy accompany-
ing the Presidential nomination
of Henry Wallace, the lowa
Swami and political boomerang-
tosser.” What reporters attend-
ing the show saw, says O’Don-
nell, “was, in fact, nothing more
than a gaudy but excellent
demonstration of how the tech-
nique of the Kremlin, or of the
late Duce or the departed Herr
Hitler, can organise and dis-
cipline a politically-hysterical
mob right here in the United
States They saw ill-educated or
m.sguided youth well-meaning
Snc “slickly
power-mad tools oemg siicxiy
manipulated, physically an d
emotionally, by a handful of
cold - brained, practical and
utterly selfish men who know
what they want, have the eye on
pect to achieve their object not
now, not next November, but
four, eight or 40 years from
now.”
The Philadelphia “Inquirer”
political scribe, John M. Cum-
mings, declared: “If television
could bring the proceedings into
every home Henry wouldn’t get
enough votes to wad a gun.
Walking around the hall, you
find yourself wondering how so
many starry-eyed halfbakes got
out of the booby hatch.”
To Westbrook Pegler, of the
Hearst Press, those who gathered
to howl for the new party and
its prophet were “traitors, tat-
terdemalions, political degener-
ates and imbeciles and the
leaven of gullible innocents who
have adopted Henry Wallace as
a composite fool and Mahatma
for the campaign of 1948.”
As a final example, the show
attracted no less competent a
master of invective than H. L.
Mencken, to give readers of the
Baltimore “Sun” some value for
their money. Mencken diag-
nosed Wallace’s team-mate Tay-
lor as “a third-rate mounte-
bank,” and sweetly designated
Henry “a thumping ass.”
Italy’s Colonies.
Quite frequently over the
past year or so American reports
from Italy have singled out for
comment a strong anti-British
feeling noted among Italians—
a striking change from the
mutual Anglo-Italian friend-
ship that had been remarked on
for generations.
That no mere bias accounts
for these reports is shown by
the corroborative comments of
London “Times” Rome corres-
pondent, who has put the anti-
British feeling down simply to
Italians’ fears for the future of
' their former African posses-
sions ; their suspicion that
Britain is consolidating in them
and means to stay.
The former colonies played “a
recurrent and significant” part in
the Italian elections a month or
two back —Communists, of
course, working on the popular
feelings and stirring up hatred
of Britain. As well as such
general, patriotic feelings, the
“Times” man .mentions the fact
that 500,000 Italians are con-
sidered to have a direct personal
interest in the old African
possessions.
When the international in-
quiry commission recently visi-
ted Tripolitania there were
fresh outbursts against Britain,
“who was accused of rigging the
inquiry.” In Italy itself the
correspondent noted a large
poster displayed throughout the
country, showing what purports
to be a terrifying scene of
carnage during a riot in the
colonies, and carrying, with the
British flag, the words “England
wants the colonies and orders
the slaughter of Italians.” (This,
incidentally, is so like the vicious
Zionist hate-Britain propaganda
in America as to suggest a
probable similar inspiration.)
Another poster, also displayed
throughout Italy, showed a hand
stretching out protectingly from
Russia, with the legend: “Since
1946 Russia has declared that
the colonies must remain in
Italian hands.”
The “Times” man reports
that this sort of propaganda is
condemned by thinking Italians,
who, nevertheless, share the
strong feeling for the return of
the colonies, both for patriotic
and economic reasons:
“On economic grounds they
argue that the population of
Italy will soon reach 50,000,000,
and no single country can accept
within its borders the masses
whom Italy herself cannot
support, and few will find a
home and work in America or
in Europe. At a recent man-
power conference in Rome it
was estimated that there were
1.500.000 Italians for whom no
work was immediately available,
and this at a time when recon-
struction is the key-word
throughout a war-stricken world.
Italy is not planning to send the
bulk of her redundant man-
power to Africa, but she does
wish to transfer oversea again
those who had to leave their
• homes, land, businesses, and
interests of all kinds. About
300.000 Italians of both sexes
and of all ages were, it is
asserted, exiled from the
colonies. They are now a burden
to the State, and their lot is a
wretched one.”
Italy, the correspondent con-
cludes, “is cautiously feeling her
way along the road which leads
her back to equality with the
Western Powers, but until the
colonial question is adjusted to
her satisfaction, it is argued, this
will drag like an iron weight on
her statesmen’s feet.”
Dragnet Digest.
Fantastic Oil Story. —One of the
very soundest of correspondents, C. L.
Sulzberger of N. Y. “Times,” sent his
paper this staggering report from the
Middle East: The petroleum pipelines
to Haifa are not Only not pumping
oil to the huge refineries there but,
instead, crude oil is being secretly
transported from Western lands by
tanker, to be processed at this termi-
nus of a Middle Eastern overland
supply source!

Gold in Them Thar Vaults— When
they counted, weighed, measured or
surveyed it the other day the U.S.
gold-hoard at Fort Knox was
reckoned to amount to the pretty
sum of $23,660,752,355.78, having in-
creased by more than two billion
(American) in the past 12 months.
“On a dollar-for-dollar basis it now
almost equals the amount of paper
money in circulation which legally
has to be ‘backed’ only 25 per cent,
by gold.”

In Darkest U.S.— The Wallaceites
in their U.S. Presidential bid are
making a special appeal to the
negroes, of whom the country now
has 13,000,000. The appeal would
appear to be having some effect; in
N. Y. “Sun” George E. Sokolsky
comments on it: “Wallace having
stimulated negro rebelliousness has
channelled American history into a
treacherous and perilous course.”
* * * *
In Occupied Austria. From
Vienna a “Wall-street Journal” cor-
respondent reports what is merely
one instance in the general situation
that the U.S. most certainly isn’t
going to put up with indefinitely. The
U.S., says the report, has already
given, or committed, about
$350,000,000 to Austria, not counting
an estimated $100,000,000 from the
Marshall Plan. Russia, on the other
hand, has drained Austria for un-
counted millions —a rock-bottom esti-
mate is $180,000,000. “Thus the
United States gives, Russia takes, and
Austria lives on what it can grab
as the money passes by.”
* * * *
Policy All Reject. One of the
minority in America favoring the
latest pilgrimage to Moscow, Walter
Lippmann, in N. Y, “Herald
Tribune,” casts doubt on the U.S.-
British proposals for Germany: “A
German policy which the Germans
do not want, the French do not want,
the Poles and Czechs do not want,
which the Russians, of course, do 091
want, which, in fact, the civilians in
the U.S. State Department did not
want, cannot be such a masterpiece
of statesmanship that Europe must
take it or else.” Which, of course,
quite overlooks that no policy what-
ever would be agreed to by all that
lot.

A Little Invective. A reporter
present lets himself go properly on
an American Presidential convention:
“The members who composed it were,
seven-eighths of them, the meanest
kind of bawling and blowing office-
holders, office-seekers, pimps, malig-
nants, conspirators, murderers, fancy-
men, custom-house clerks, contractors,
kept editors, spaniels well trained to
carry and fetch, jobbers, infidels, dis-

HEAVILY REPULSED.
Socialism and that “pushing-round” of
the people which has become a feature
of Chifleyism took a heavy and thoroughly
deserved knock in the High Court’s deci-
sion on the 1947 Bank Act. The Gov-
ernment’s design was not limited to “con-
trol” of banking by creating a Govern-
ment monopoly and eliminating all private
enterprise in banking, but sought to
establish permanent central and social-
istic control of all business activity
through banking. It was "a. first step in
socialisation of everything.
The irresponsible nature of the Govern-
ment’s action was pointedly rebuked by
the Court’s voluntarily awarding costs
against the Government. Never before
has the High Court, as interpreter
of the Constitution, so heavily re-
pulsed an Act of the Federal Parlia-
ment, and certainly never has its
censure expressed so completely the feel-
ings of the great mass of electors. The
public of today is better informed, and
therefore perhaps less demonstrative,
than that of England of 250 years ago ;
making that allowance, the trial of this
issue—by reason of the interests at stake,
the tyranny threatened, the assault on the
whole domain of citizens’ freedom in-
volved in it—is worthy to rank in sig-
nificance alongside the trial of the Seven
Bishops. The Crown stands revealed in
as intolerable an abuse of power through
Mr. Chifley now as by James II in 1688.
Great numbers of people who might
have remained unmoved by political en-
croachment on the banks as independent
institutions were aroused in this instance
by" the realisation that much more than
the banks was under attack. Every man
with even the smallest stake in the good
government of this democracy was put
on the alert a year ago, during “Labor’s”
preliminary battle before the High Court,
when the Chief Justice likened the
attempted penalising of a particular class
of the trading banks’ clients to the
proscription of “all persons professing a
certain religion, or belonging to a par-
ticular party, or following a particular
occupation.” The alert was doubled by
Mr. Chifley’s reactions to that rebuff. He
acted as though he rated his authority
beyond question by the electorate, or by
the Constitution, either —as though in his
view the vindication of his pique,
the serving of his private political ven-
geance, claimed priority of attention and
satisfaction through the whole machinery
of State.
The public was soon made aware of
the ill-humor and megalomania in the
head of the Commonwealth Government.
In Mr. Chifley’s curt announcement of in-
tention forthwith to “control” the trad-
ing banks by absorbing them in a Gov-
ernment monopoly, in the longer state-
ment from him after he had obtained
Caucus endorsement, and in his second-
reading speech on the infamous Bank
Bill, this leader of Parliament in a British
democracy left no doubt whatever that
he didn’t care two straws whether or not
he had a mandate from the electors' for
the legislative violence he was under-
taking.
HiS original excuse was that
the country must be held to ap-
prove without any explicit consultation,
because socialisation had been on the
“Labor” platform for a quarter of a
century, and the people were fully mind-
ful of that circumstance when they voted
for his colorless electioneering pro-
gramme in 1946. That excuse was soon
abandoned in face of the obvious and
rising public resentment; but the admis-
sion of long-premeditated socialistic in-
tent has not been forgotten by the people.
Unable to maintain that he had any sort
of mandate, Mr. Chifley next declared
he wouldn’t seek one, and that even if
his action resulted at the next elections in
political disaster to himself and his party,
at least he would have struck a blow for
the socialist revolution and smashed
something which could not be repaired.
The defiance by Ministers of the
people’s right to pronounce in advance
upon so monstrous a procedure was
matched only by their pretences. Dr.
Evatt, in a book professing to be the latest
authority on constitutional law, had
bound himself unreservedly to the opinion
that in all such cases the electors had a
right to be consulted. The proven error
in his advice about the legality of the
1945 Act served not in the least to re-
strain either him or the Prime Minister
in their new outrage in statutory fornu
They cared for neither legality nor an
electoral mandate. Mr. Chifley repeated
with contempt his refusal of a referen-
dum, and proceeded in the 1947
Act to resort to an excess of that very
compulsion already declared ultra vires.
The Court has now very plainly said
what it thinks about that; and the public
reaction was one of gratitude and relief.
Meanwhile Dr. Evatt had decamped in
good time overseas. Mr. Chifley at the
judgment hour was in a plane bound for
Melbourne. Elsewhere the Communists,
engaged in plotting the further strangling
of Australian industry and transport in
Moscow’s interests, doubtless allowed
themselves to be distracted temporarily
by the news of the High Court’s annihila-
tion of an important contribution by
Mr. Chifley towards their revolutionary
objective. The “mimicking Molotov”
Sharkey’s dictum at the height of the
public protests last year was:
This Banking Bill is only the commence-
ment, but a very important commencement,
the most important ever taken by the
“Labor” movement here. Because of it
we are throwing our weight behind the
“Labor”-party candidates [in the Victorian
elections].
Mr. Chifley and the whole “Labor” gang
which he committed to socialisation
knew the Bank Socialisation Act to be
exactly what the Communists wanted.
The only other interpretation of the
Act is that it was a stupid and mis-
chievous stunt. It was bound to kill that
united effort for increased production of
goods and services which Mr. Chifley
still says he wants. At such a time the
throwing of this bone of contention into
the community is the action of a hypo-
crite or a clown.
Mr. Chifley will not do the obvious
thing—resign and test the electors’ con-
fidence in him, even though the May
referendum result was already a request
for him to go. He has made clear that
he means to ignore the electors’ opinion
until his time expires. He gained his re-
election to office two years ago (as he has
since made clear) by deceiving the people
about his intentions, and the “Labor”
socialisation objective is revealed as his
only programme for the unexpired period
of his elected term. The banking ramp
forced Mr. Chifley to expose his socialis-
tic hand; but the people, through their
Constitution and the rule of law, have
so far held the trumps.
On Friday the Prime Minister,
swallowing yet another “ ‘Labor’ prin-
ciple,” said Cabinet had approved of an
appeal to the Privy Council. The political
aspect of this alone should bring shudders
to many a member of “Labor” Caucus
who would like, for the sake of his Par-
liamentary seat, to see the whole thing
dead, buried and —most important—for-
gotten.
"Political Philosophy."
If this country is to rid itself of the
poisonous Communism which now regu-
larly disrupts industry, puts a blight on
relations between employer and wage-
earner and embitters our intercourse with
other white races we will have to drop
the fallacy that, because it is organised
to promote a “political philosophy,” the
Communist party should enjoy the free-
doms of a democratic political party.
This “political” concept was propagated
by Dr. Evatt when he first took office,
and has been perpetuated by other
“Labor” Ministers, including the Prime
Minister, It has also been adopted by
some Courts. Counsel are often told
by magistrates and Judges when they
seek to establish, on the score of “credit,”
whether witnesses are Communists or not
that the Court will not allow “politics”
to be brought into the case.
Communism is, of course, a ‘‘political
philosophy,” as Mr. Chifley says. But
before a political philosophy can justly
claim the right to be generally preached
it must be proved that it is also a con-
stitutional philosophy.
There are several conditions which a
“political” party must satisfy before it
can be allowed the run of the country.
The first of them is that it elects to ob-
tain its aims by peaceful constitutional
means and not by violence. The second
is that in carrying out its campaigns of
persuasion it shall operate openly, frankly
and honestly, and that it shall obey the
laws of the land, A third is that it shall
be its own master, and not the agent of
a foreign Power.
None of these conditions does the
Communist party satisfy. It operates
through bodies which are not frank and
open as to their objects and connections.
As often as not its leaders deny their
creed in public. They organise for the
overthrow of the Constitution by violence
and by a minority. They use intimidation,
industrial espionage and sabotage with-
out the. slightest scruple. They urge
recourse to civil war to overthrow the
private ownership of property. They ad-
vocate “the establishment of socialism
according to the scientific principles
given us by the great teachers of man-
kind, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, ex-
pressed in the 'policy of the Communist
International.”
This is set out in their constitution, con-
firmed in March, 1943, when they re-
affirmed a rule which had been standing
for a quarter of a century in their rule-
book and which said that the Communist
party of Australia was “affiliated to the
Communist International,” and that
resolutions and decisions of the Interna-
tional’s congresses should be considered
and acted upon by the supreme authority
of the Communist party of Australia.
The Communist International was
officially abolished in June, 1943 —with-
out any reference to the Australian Com-
munist party, which had a member on
its executive —but the Australian branch
has continued to take its orders from
abroad with the same servility which it
showed before the Comintern went under
cover. In the Canadian spy trials it was
proved that in 1945 the Comintern still
existed in secret.
Upon coming into power in 1929, after
the brazen and admitted interference of
Moscow in the local affairs of the
party, which had been in some dis-
order through internal quarrels, Aus-
tralian Communist heads published a 98-
page book which bears on its front cover
the emblem of the red star of Russia
branded with the hammer and sickle and
the words: “Communism. The Pro-
gramme of the Communist International.
Published by the Communist party of
Australia.” And in this awful document,
of which numerous editions and elucida-
tions have been printed since, though not
for circulation outside the more exclu-
sive party membership in recent years, it
is revealed to what the so-called “Aus-
tralian” Communist party stands pledged.
Anyone who does not recognise that
these principles are more worthy of bar-
barous Asiatic terrorists than of the
members of a civilised white race, and
that they brand the party as being in-
volved in treasonable conspiracy against
the State and merit its suppression by the
use of every authority which the Aus-
tralian Government possesses, is not very
intelligent.
What justification is there for allow-
ing the use of unlimited telephones,
the ownership of property and news-
papers and the right to dominate
trade-unions, including those- which
hold the keys of defence, to an
organisation which preaches that the
“workers of the world now have their
own State the one and only fatherland
of the international proletariat the
Soviet Union,” and that “world economy
has been split into two fundamentally
hostile camps: the camp of the imperialist
States and the camp of the dictatorship
of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R.”?
What has Mr. Chifley to say about a
“political philosophy” whose votaries not
only advocate but are actively organising,
in accordance with the principle set out
in their own documenls, “the conquest
of power by the proletariat,” which, they
emphasise, does not mean peacefully
capturing “the ready-made bourgeois
machinery by means of a Parliamentary
majority”? The conquest of power
by the proletariat (they declare) is
“the violent overthrow of bourgeois
power, the destruction of the capitalist
State apparatus (bourgeois armies,
police, bureaucratic hierarchy, the
judiciary. Parliaments, etc.), and the sub-
stitution in its place of new organs of
proletarian power, to serve primarily as
instruments for the suppression of the
exploiters” —an “exploiter” being, of
course, anybody opposed, or believed to
be opposed, to Soviet Russia and Com-
munism.
Is the Prime Minister actually in favor
of allowing any members of such bodies
as the Stevedoring Commission to be also
members of the central committee of a
concern which proposes to transform this
country by violence into a Soviet State,
and which has accepted it as a basic aspi-
ration that that State will be “the dictator-
ship of the proletariat, the rule of a single
class,” and that it will “deprive its class
enemies of political rights” and “disarm
and suppress” them? This is what “The
Programme of the Communist Inter-
national,” as adopted and published by
the Australian Communist party, says:
The Soviet State completely disarms the
bourgeoisie and concentrates all arms in
the hands of the proletariat; it is the armed
proletarian State. The armed forces under
the Soviet State are organised on a class
basis, which corresponds to the structure
of the proletarian dictatorship and guaran-
tees the role of leadership to the industrial
proletariat. The organisation, while main-
taining revolutionary discipline, ensures to
the warriors of the Red Army and Navy
close and constant contacts with the masses
of the toilers, participation in the adminis-
tration of the country and in the work of
building up socialism.
It is stated that military attack on
the Soviet Union must “inevitably
lead to a revolutionary outbreak which
must overwhelm Capitalism in a number
of so-called civilised countries, unleash
the victorious revolution in the colonies”
and “bring about the world victory of
socialism.”
This privileged foreign-based body,
whose membership is inextricably mixed
up with that of unions which finance and
participate in the operations of the Aus-
tralian “Labor” party, has, like its fellow-
conspirators of the Communist Inter-
national, always recognised the “right of
armed rebellion against imperialism [i.e.,
the right of armed rebellion and revolu-
tionary war]” —as it is doing in Malaya,
where peaceful Australian citizens are
being bloodily murdered by invading
Chinese bandits, agents of the world revo-
lution, with the approval of the Australian
Communist press and leadership.
It would, indeed, be interesting to hear
the Prime Minister in open debate upon
a “political philosophy” which propagates
these views and which elects to submit to
“only one discipline, viz., the interna-
tional proletarian discipline, which
guarantees victory in the struggle of the
world’s workers for world proletarian
dictatorship,” and whose votaries have
openly and officially proclaimed in print
in this country that their aims “can only
be attained by the forcible overthrow of
all the existing social conditions.”
Canada's New Leader.
Canada is to have a change of Prime
Ministers later this year, but the switch-
over will not involve any radical changes
in policy ; William Lyon Mackenzie King
and Louis Stephen St. Laurent worked
closely together during the years of their
country’s great war effort, closer still
since, and they see eye to eye on most
things that matter. In this they typify
the unity in essentials of the two races
from which modern Canada sprang.
In origins the two men stem from
families with their roots far back in
Canadian history. King’s maternal grand-
father was William Lyon Mackenzie,
first Mayor of Toronto and a fiery figure
in Ontario public life a century ago—
in 1837 he led an armed uprising, which,
though abortive, had much to do with the
granting of responsible government to
Upper Canada —and his father’s father
was John King, a lieutenant in the de-
tachment of troops that put down Mac-
kenzie’s rebellion. The first St. Laurent
was in Canada long before the Mac-
kenzies or the Kings; his distinguished
descendant spoke recently of his ancestors
as being among those who were “ceded
lock, stock and barrel” along with Quebec
at the end of the Seven “Years’ War.
Dissimilar in their origins, the old and
the new Prime Ministers came to leader-
ship by very different roads. King entered
Parliament 40 years ago with a reputation
as a political student and an authority on
industrial affairs; St. Laurent was at the
top of the legal profession and a director
of the Bank of Montreal and several
public companies when he first sat in the
Canadian Commons only seven years ago.
As a young man King spent eight years
in charge of the Canadian Department of
Labor. In 1908 he entered Parliament
as a Liberal, and Sir Wilfred Laurier
made him Minister for Labor.
When Laurier’s Government was de-
feated in 1911, King lost his seat. During
the next eight years he acted as secretary
to the Liberal party and as director of in-
dustrial research for the Rockefeller Foun-
dation. Laurier died in 1919, and King
was chosen as Liberal leader. He re-
entered Parliament, and two years later
won a general election and became Prime
Minister. Since then he has twice been
in Opposition, but his total service as
head of the Government is over 21 years,
a record unequalled in any British coun-
try. Britain has had seven Prime Minis-
ters since King first took the oath of
office, Australia ten.
King has always stood for a strong
Canada, completely autonomous within
the British Commonwealth, yet at the
same time co-operating closely with
America —in 1911 the Laurier Govern-
ment went out of office over reciprocity
proposals, but in 1935 King successfully
negotiated a reciprocal trade agreement
with U.S.A. Today, of course, the two
countries have a permanent Joint De-
fence Board,
St. Laurent, now 66, graduated in law?
became a professor of law, and later he
built up a big practice at the bar, becom-,
ing bar president. At the end of 1941}
he was appointed Minister of Justice
and Attorney-General in succession to
fellow French-Canadian Ernest Lapointe,
and immediately became one of the
strong men of the Cabinet. He went with
Mackenzie King to the San Francisco
Conference and led the Canadian dele-
gation to the first session of U.N.O-:
King had always looked after External
Affairs himself, but in 1945, when he
visited London, he put St. Laurent &
temporary charge, and a year later
handed over the portfolio to him. '
St. Laurent and Mackenzie King be-
lieve in international co-operation, but
neither deludes himself that security rests
in words alone. The changing of the
guard in Canada will not mean a relaxing
of the guard.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Victoria's Budget.
It came out in Premier Hollway’s
Budget speech that some of the Premiers,
concerned with their State finances and
somewhat hungrily eyeing the over-
stuffed Treasury at Canberra, sought an
earlier Premiers’ Conference so that they
might know where they stood in the
matter of grants and reimbursements
from Federal tax funds before present-
ing their Budgets. To this Mr. Chifley
turned a deaf ear, stolidly insisting
that the Premiers wouldn’t meet until late
this month, Mr. Hollway had perforce
to estimate that he’d get £10,118,000 by
way of uniform-tax reimbursement, and
on that budgeted for a deficit of
£3,300,000.
That he should have to do so shows
the unhappy financial position to which
the States are being reduced, both by
Canberra’s maladministration of uni-
form-tax revenue and by industrial law-
lessness and slow-down of production,
each a result of Federal Labor’s failure
either to govern or inspire.
Mr. Hollway, like Mr. Playford, of
S.A., finds himself frustrated, and, as with
Mr. Playford, the railways are his biggest
headache. The strike last January, the
subsequent chronic shortages of N.S.W.
coal which forced train cuts, wage-
increases and shorter working week all
cost the Victorian railways dearly. As-
suming, somewhat hopefully, better coal
supplies and no strike trouble, Mr. Holl-
way estimates rail revenue this year at
£17,150,000, £841,000 above last year,
with an increase in working expenses
of £1,642,000 to make a total of
£16,989,000. “Continuous and ade-
quate supplies of coal from N.S.W.”
was Mr. Playford’s condition for im-
proved rail revenues in his Budget; “If
reasonably adequate supplies of suitable
black coal were available” Mr, Holl-
way’s.
Refusing to “sanction reductions in
standards of education, health services,
country water-supply” and so forth
“merely for the sake of balancing the
Budget,” this Liberal Premier boldly an-
nounced items of £7,975,000 (an increase
of for education, nearly
£4,000,000 (up £785,000) for health ser-
vices, £6,500,000 capital expenditure on
housing (it was £4,943,000 last year), and
amounts totalling nearly £55,000 for
various educational and cultural objects.
The deficit is Victoria’s biggest, the pre-
vious largest being nearly £l\ million in
the depression year 1930-31. It is made
up of £2,005,000 for railways, £1,211,000
on the General Account and £84,000 on
the State coalmine.
To anyone not familiar with the
general set-up of government in Aus-
tralia it would seem extraordinary that
in a time when everybody is employed at
high wages, when the land is yielding
large quantities of products for which
there is a howling demand at high prices,
when there is a ready market for every-
thing made in factories and when the
profligate Socialist Government at Can-
berra is overwhelmed with revenue, a well-
balanced State like Victoria should have
to budget for a heavy deficit. There is
nothing extraordinary about it to anyone
with merely a glimmer of understanding.
The extraordinary thing is that the States
—especially Liberal-governed States de-
pending on N.S.W. coal and Canberra
tax-reimbursements—are managing to
keep afloat at all.
Another Communist Defeat.
Thrice in eight months two State
Premiers (Hollway and Hanlon, one a
Liberal, the other Labor) have stood up
to Communists and beaten them. It
proves what has been here said fre-
quently: that Corns quail when con-
fronted by determined opponents and
that the decent Australian unionist will
follow a strong lead. In Victoria in
January Hollway squashed a transport
strike by rushing through legislation
ordering secret ballots and providing
heavy fines for union bosses who dis-
obeyed, and told the strikers to go back
to work. They did, and Hollway, though
the Comrades yelled blue murder, has
had little trouble since.
A couple of months afterwards the
Comrades picked on Queensland. Profit-
ing by the Hollway example, Hanlon
brought in an anti-picketing law, with
fines for disobedience. Communist
menaces and a Com. appeal to Chifley
left Hanlon unmoved. Those who tried
picketing encountered a determined police
force, some suffered sore heads and were
taken to court and fined. Surlily an-
nouncing that they wouldn’t pay the
fines, the convicted Corns and their
stooges saw the strike broken.
The law waited for the fines to be paid.
They weren’t. The other week the de-
faulters were run in—Healy, Englart,
Julius (three leading Corns), and a couple
of lesser fellows. Squealing like stuck
pigs, the Com. mob threatened to block-
ade Queensland and pull out everybody
in Australia. Hanlon was unmoved.
Stopworks were called. Sharkey, the
boss Com., fresh from inciting Chinese
murderers of white men in Malaya, ap-
peared in Queensland. Five Communist-
run unions met in Sydney “to plan strike
action,” and called on the usually com-
pliant A.C.T.U. to stage a hold-up. For
once the A.C.T.U. wasn’t compliant.
Neither were the rank and file. Given a
chance at mass meetings, members of
Com.-run unions rejected the strike. In
Townsville only three unions—seamen,
watersiders and meat-industry employees
—supported the strike plan. Healy, Eng-
lart, Julius and the others were still
languishing behind bars when this was
printed. If it were not for the friends
they still have at Canberra it could be
said that the Corns were on the defensive,
and in retreat.
Fell or Pushed?
The newest Red melodrama:
A legendary thriller, often heard of in the
music-halls of 40 years ago but never on a
bookshelf, appears at last due for a Russian
translation. It was called Did She Fall or Was
She Pushed, Or the Gory Hand, Or Who Did
It? by Annie Swan. And its plot is being
enacted in New York, with —what is rare in
actual life —characters whose names are worthy
of their actions and surroundings.
The tale began last week-end when Countess
Tolstoy took members of a Russian family
named Samarin, who had appealed to her for
aid, to a farm run by White Russians near
Freehold —sinister capitalist name! —New Jersey.
Her guests were “hidden in an old truck”
(With acknowledgments to Watts.)
THE LAST STRING.
era route, and their paterfamilias was alleged
to have declared that the Russian Embassy was
trying to send him back to Russia —be believed
to death or Siberian exile. Countess Tolstoy,
whom the Russian Embassy accused of having
kidnapped the poor tovarish and his babushkas,
behaved in the usual diabolic manner of White
Russians and advised the fugitive to see the
F. 8.1. It refused to yield up his carcass
when it was demanded by the Soviet Ambas-
sador, M. Panyushkin, who alleged that the
poor chap had been kidnapped by the brutal
Tolstoys along with a lady named Oksana
Stephanovna Kosenkina, a Soviet school-
teacher; also, that the F. 8.1. was involved with
the vile Trotskyites and Czarists in a plot to
“terrorise” Soviet citizens.
The U.S. State Department announced that
M. Panyushkin’s protest was “not acceptable”
—which is a diplomatist’s way of saying “Go
to blazes” —but not before a Russian expedition
had invaded Freehold (ugh!), New Jersey, and
retrieved Oksana Stephanovna Kosenkina from
the White Russian fiends, who declared that
she had no wish to be rescued and, in fact,
had shown a remarkable resistance to the idea
of going back to the Soviet Consulate-General.
Requests that the lady should be allowed
to say publicly what her own view was were
met with a cold negative by M. Lomakin, who
had her locked up on Russian diplomatic
territory. A Galahad in the shape of Congress-
man Mundt, of the Committee which is now
investigating the operations of a vast U.S. spy-
ring, having hollered for a rescue party, a suit-
able committee of citizens secured an order
from Justice Dickstein to the Soviet authorities
to produce the lady, with a rider that if they
didn’t he would order the sheriff to raid the
Consulate-General and bring her out. To this
M. Lomakin muttered something to the effect
that the Judge could go jump in Lake Baikal,
after which the matter entered the realm of
high politics.
The Soviet Ambassador, above the pleadings
of M. Lomakin for the return of M. Samarin,
whose reluctance to return to his fatherland
was now attributed in Russian circles to a
cracked noddle which had allowed a few
bats to enter his belfry, was heard imploring
the State Department (which yielded to his
protestations pending appeal to the Supreme
Court) to prevent Justice Dickstein from violat-
ing the sanctity of Russian soil, while M.
Molotov, in Moscow, announced that several
Russians who had been due to leave on July
31 for their homeland from New York had
disappeared and that it had been learned from
Mrs. Kosenkina herself that she had been kid-
napped by the “Russian White Guard gangster
organisation,” with which, he alleged, the F. 8.1.
was connected!
The next event of note was the sudden
arrival of the unfortunate Mrs. Kosenkina in
the open-air—under her own propulsion, if the
Russian Consul-General’s story can be believed,
which, of course, it may be. ( Vide Sydney
“Tribune” or Mr. Sharkey). It appears that,
having heard over the radio, in the Consul-
General’s presence, the disturbing news of the
F.8.1.’s pursuit of her, she walked from the
room and, when alone, felt one of those sudden
urges which sometimes afflict Russian citizens
to jump out of a window 50ft. from the ground
in order to apply shock-treatment to her nerves.
This urge also frequently affects other persons
domiciled or present in Soviet or Communist —
and, in pre-war days, Japanese—buildings, as
in the case of Mr. Masaryk, of Czechoslovakia,
who did exactly the same thing in Prague.
The story of an outsider, an American citizen,
who said that he heard screams and protests
before the lady fell, may be discounted, as he
is said to be an imperialist. And so, within
the best Communist circles, can the skill of
the U.S. surgeon who says that he cannot find
any signs of dementia in either the
Kosenkina lady or Mr. Samarin, the other
Russian now in the clutches of the F. 8.1. At
any rate, he cannot find the crack in Samarin’s
top-piece, though the Russians say one is there,
and with cynical elan even declares that
Tovarish Samarin’s coconut has not been
cracked at any time whatever.
Meanwhile the unfortunate woman in the
case lies at death’s door, the brave heroes of
the Soviet Union not having succeeded in re-
trieving her from the clutches of Uncle Sam’s
watchful harness-bulls, who carted her off to
a hospital instead of allowing her to remain
in the Russian Consulate-General, where she
could have had effective modern medical atten-
tion, which is well known to be unavailable to
citizens of backward imperialist States like the
U.S. and Britain. It seems likely that, under
stress, the poor woman may express a prefer-
ence for life in the United States. After which,
no doubt, the Soviet Embassy will make its
normal discovery about her and other fugitives
—that they vamoosed with something belonging
to the Soviet Government and have therefore
become fit subjects for extradition.
Whatever happens, Messrs. Panyushkin,
Lomakin, Molotov and the rest deserve a
medal from the Republican party. They have
succeeded in doing incalculable harm to the
campaigns of Mr. Wallace and President Truman
—whose verdict about all the spy news of the
week was that it was a red herring designed
to distract public attention from inflation
and from the fact that the Republicans, prior
to the adjournment of Congress, had torn his
legislative programme into ribbons.
What Now, Mr. Chifley?
When the triennial conference of the
A.L.J*. meets next month; —as it is
scheduled to do in Chifley
will have to report the failure of the
socialisation plot of the 1945 conference
and get the now-discredited “Labor”
platform dressed up for the general elec-
tions of next year.
Not again at general elections will he
be able to get away with the smooth
story he produced last time and pre-
tend subsequently that he had a mandate
for socialisation;
The 1943 triennial conference planned a
nation-wide socialisation campaign (not
openly, of course), dependent largely on the
carrying of the proposed 14-powers referen-
dum in 1944, which was meant to help
fasten permanently war-time central powers
upon the nation.
That referendum failed. The 1945
Bank Bill —abolishing the independent
Commonwealth Bank board, and clear-
ing the ground generally—was passed,
with vociferous assurances (for the loom-
ing 1946 elections) that socialisation of
banking was not in the Government’s
thoughts.
Yet in November, 1945, the plot had
been carried a further stage at the
triennial A.L.P. conference, which
hoisted socialisation as “Labor’s” now
“sole objective.” The conference decided
on “principles of action” and methods of
procedure. Complete control of all bank-
ing was to be achieved as a first step to-
wards socialisation, to be followed by
the taking-over similarly of insurance,
monopolies (meaning steel) and shipping.
If the Government should win the 1946
elections with some sweet nothings in a
policy speech, this! programme was to be
launched without more ado.
The obliging Chifley responded. He
won the elections, but he lost another
referendum for industrial powers, though
he carried one of its questions —that
about “social security.” On re-election
he tried to snatch away some of the trad-
ing banks’ business by forbidding them
(under the 1945 Act) to hold local-gov-
ernment bodies!’ accounts. This set
warning-bells ringing; the injured parties
invoked the High Court; and Mr.
Chifley was completely knocked out.
Thereafter he threw away all disguise,
announced he would legislate at once for
socialisation of all banks, and proceeded
to do it—as the 1945 conference had
ordered.
He refused a referendum on the issue,
though Dr. Evatt was committed up to
the hilt to allow the public a voice on any
major departure in national policy. To
the roars of delight of every Communist
in the land he brought in his Bank Grab
Bill of 1947 and got it enacted.
The immediate effect was that “Labor”
was driven from office in Victoria.
This year has seen the extension
of the battle in (1) the referendum in
May on permanent prices-control at Can-
berra (an important tool for the socialis-
tic programme) and (2) the challenge in
the High Court of the validity of the
Bank Socialisation Act.
First the electors at the referendum
and now the High Court have defeated
the Socialists heavily. The report which
Chifley will have to give to the
triennial A.L.P. conference next month is
of complete repulse of the socialisation
attack. The socialists have not only
failed ; they have been found out. And,
Privy Council appeal or no, the elections
are approaching.
Election in Tasmania.
Next Saturday Tasmanian voters will
have the opportunity of passing judgment
on the “leadership” given them by
“Labor” in recent years. The present
position in the Assembly is “Labor” 16
seats. Liberal 12, Independents two.
Under Proportional Representation in
Tasmania a big swing-over such as
occurred in Westralia and Victoria is
almost impossible, but Premier Cos-
grove’s chances of retaining his small
majority are remote. The most he can
hope for is that some of the seats he loses
will go to Independents—14 have
nominated —instead of to Liberals, and
that the Independents elected will not
oppose his Government as the two at
present in the Assembly have done.
This faint hope he seems to have
abandoned in advance by announcing
that, rather than retain office with the
help of Independents, he would ask for
a dissolution and another election. Just
what good that would do he hasn’t ex-
plained ; but a very slight swing from the
“Labor” figures of 1946 would take this
unhappy decision out of his hands. At
the last election only in Bass division did
the Cosgrove party gain more than half
the six seats. Loss of a seat in Bass
seems very likely, and with it goes
“Labor’s” majority, while in Denison
the party will be hard put to retain its
three seats —gained in 1946 with 11,667
first preferences, against 14,115 cast for
Liberal and Independent candidates.
Cosgrove in his electioneering has
made much of the Legislative Council
issue, but the experience of the Cain
Government in Victoria last year should
dispel any “Labor” optimism on that
score. Tasmanian “Labor,” like the Vic-
torian brand, has to carry the burden of
the Canberra crowd’s misdeeds, and on
top of that has to cope with the effect on
the public mind of the D’Alton and
Cosgrove affairs. Liberal leader Camp-
bell claims his party is out to give Tas-
mania “integrity in government and
freedom from Canberra control.” A
very appealing offer.
Mr. Cosgrove on his own admission is
a student of racing form. His turf
advisers would probably agree that in
next Saturday’s race he is carrying too
much weight, _
A Bad Move.
Apparently blind to the storm of pro-
tests against a similar plan of the Sydney
Government, the Brisbane one is out with
what it calls a “shire-regrouping scheme,”
the first victims of the experiment being
people around Ipswich and Toowoomba
and on the Queensland south coast.
There are to be a Greater Ipswich and a
Greater Toowoomba, and so far nobody
appears to be in favor of any of it except

the Hanlons. The Local Authorities
Association wants polls of the people
concerned. If they get that they’ll be a
jump or two head of N.S.W., where amal-
gamation goes through willy-nilly.
A lot of N.S.W. country people, hear-
ing of amalgamation, thought it was some
minor disturbance in the Sydney suburbs.
They know better now, especially at
Nowra, where five municipalities and
two shires were lumped into one shire,
and the Minister, a Mr. Cahill, calmly
appointed to the council two men who
had been hopelessly rejected at elections
a short time before. Amalgamated
Gosford and Woy Woy hate what the
local paper calls “this lumbering mon-
strosity” ; around Orange and Murru-
rundi anybody talking amalgamation is
in danger of being dealt with forcibly;
and when Kearsley Shire heard that it
was likely to be taken into Cessnock
municipality it fled to Patrick Plains seek-
ing refuge.
In city and country the thing is mis-
trusted, and nobody except the McGirr
crowd wants it. Their aim is clear
enough—centralised local government
dominated by party men —and it was one
of the reasons why they lost Kogarah,
amalgamation being an issue of the by-
election that put Alderman Cross in as
Liberal member and set McGirr squealing
with disappointment. For the most part
local government has escaped the blight
of partyism, which is why it manages so
well; and the Hanlons would be wise to
drop the business.
POLITICAL POINTS
Although the Federal “Labor” plat-
form looks upon the Privy Council as an
appanage of imperialism and favors mak-
ing the High Court the final arbiter in
Australian legal disputes, Chifley lost no
time in deciding to seek the Council’s
opinion on the High Court’s judgment on
the Bank Act. It will be an expensive
business, but that aspect never worries
Chifley when the taxpayers —already up
for £75,000 —are footing the bill.
Murder of a Sydney man by Com-
munist bandits in Malaya brought from
their fellow-ruffian Sharkey the remark
that “If people get killed in these cir-
cumstances, I can’t help it and neither
can you” (i.e., the Commo mob he was
addressing in Newcastle). That seems to
be the Chifley attitude also, though the
murder has brought renewed requests for
Government action to protect Australians
in the trouble areas. On form Canberra’s
reaction is easy to tip—Calwell will prob-
ably deport the victim’s Chinese wife.
All this fuss about N.S.W. wheat ship-
ments causes hollow laughter on the
Queensland sugar coast. There, despite
visits by Federal politicians, the Steve-
doring Industry Commission and sundry
other persons, the turn-round of ships is
slower than ever, the is chock-a-
block with sugar and a new cane harvest
is rolling in. At the end of July ship-
ments were 32,000 tons below the target.
Ward, the only Minister to give an
immediate comment on the Banking deci-
sion : “Racehorses are accustomed to up-
sets of form, but the High Court never.”
Precise-ly!
If, as Mr. Clive Evatt asserts. Premier
McGirr has not stopped the three huge
housing projects, to cost about £700,000,
which are contemplated in Sydney,
public indignation should see to it
that they are stopped. One site is
beside the bottleneck of the road traffic
entering Sydney Bridge from the north —
it is on a newly-formed dump directly on
the main highway; the second is pn
valuable city land in College-street look-
ing down into the damp valley of Wool-
loomooloo. And the third is in darkest
Newtown. The only feasible reason for
the choice of these and other Housing
Department sites is that they abut directly
on roaring traffic roads, from which the
maximum number of passers-by will be
able to read the ornate eye-level marble
advertisements which the Minister always
has erected to himself on the walls of his
edifices.
Because most of the petrol used in
Australia is bought by commercial and
industrial users, who pass the cost of
petrol tax on to the public in “transporta-
tion and delivery charges,” Mr. Chifley
has discovered that “it is inappropriate
to contend that the whole of the proceeds
should be used for road purposes.” So
the public, in addition to income, enter-
tainment, social-services, sales and other
taxes is also paying a petrol tax to this
rapacious Government. A very good
argument for its reduction.
Evatt, asked in Geneva to comment on
the High Court’s finding in the Banks
Case, had for almost the first time in his
career nothing to say. It is not surprising.
After all, when a man has taken 17 days
and 700,000 words to prove a thing
right, and then the Court turns round
and says it’s wrong, it’s obvious that he
has already used 700,000 words too many.
Dr. E. P. Dark, of Katoomba (N.S.W.),
has issued an arresting volume, the con-
tents of which remind the reader of a
gidgee scrub after a hurricane has passed
through it. It is designed (according to
the author) to set out “the reasonable
grounds which the Soviet Union has for
suspecting the intentions of the capitalist
Powers.”* Showing a sense of humor rare
among the friends of Communism, the
doctor has had his masterpiece printed by
an organisation called the “Pinchgut
Press.”
The desperate leap of Mrs. Kosenkina
from the third floor of the Russian con-
sulate in New York testifies starkly against
the tyranny behind the Iron Curtain. This
woman had spent all her adult life under
the Soviet system and had been hand-
picked as a suitable person to teach the
children of kussian diplomats in
America ; yet after a short experience of
life in a free country she was prepared to
risk death rather than go back to the
Workers’ Fatherland. Two other teachers
who have placed themselves under U.S.
protection have said that their return to
Russia would mean death or Siberia.
Consul-General Lomakin, who seems to
have botched his assignment, must be feel-
ing rather uneasy these days as he opens
his Moscow mail.
Under the McLarty Government’s pro-
visional redistribution of seats in W.A.
the city is to gain three at the expense
of the bush. Kanowna, Brown Hill-
Ivanhoe and Mt. Magnet, all held by
Labor, are to go and there will be one
new seat, Eyre. In the North-West, Roe-
boume, also held by Labor, is outed.
Quotas on which the new boundaries are
defined are 8602 for metropolitan and
4449 for country, thus requiring two city
votes for every country one. Objectors
have two months in which to lodge
plaints. Labor is bursting with objec-
tions.
“All private and State credit and
banking institutions have been taken over
by the Government.” No, not in Aus-
tralia ; the announcement comes from
Rumania. Our local commissars must
look with envious eyes towards the Balkan
Government that doesn’t have to worry
about High Courts, Privy Councils or
even the opinion of the people, but is
free to make its own decisions as long as
they accord exactly with what Moscow
dictates.
Storm-clouds are gathering in New
Guinea as a result of a report that a
pipeline reputed to have cost £60,000 has
been sold to “a gold prospector, formerly
a patrol-officer,” for £4OO. External
Territories Minister Ward, in announcing
the appointment of a special commis-
sioner to inquire into the affair, said the
whole deal had been handled in New
Guinea without reference to his depart-
ment. He had no knowledge of the
actual cost of the pipeline. The line is in
the vicinity of Lae, not Brisbane.
The president and another member of
the New Housewives Association have,
according to a decision of the New South
Wales A.L.P., placed themselves outside
the “Labor” party by remaining in their
association after the A.L.P. executive had
declared it a Communist-c.ontrolled body.
The New Housewives are a team of
female Corns, hard of face and shrill of
voice, who do their housewiving in the
brief intervals when they are not “demon-
strating,” yelling for “hands off” this or
that, attending “monster rallies” or putting
Communist handbills in letterboxes. The
expelled ladies have a right of appeal to
the next A.L.P. conference. If they ask
why the Australian-Russian Society has
been given preferential treatment over
their show they’ll set “Labor” a poser.
A New Zealand lady lecturing in Bris-
bane claimed she had noticed the develop-
ment of a new racial type in Australia.
It took the form of “a sensitive type,
finely built and with the chin pointed,
showing determination and energy.” The
lady is obviously observant. That’s a
perfect word-picture of a racing-grey-
hound.
The National Coal Board in Britain is
built on much more responsible Jines
than the Chifley-McGirr affair in this
country. The British board is as legally
liable as any outside corporation, must
pay taxes, rates and other charges, must
prepare annual accounts and have them
audited on strictly commercial lines. It
must inform the public of the volume of
coal it gets, what it does with the coal
and how much it sells for. Chifley could
not order such a system here; the Com-
munists wouldn’t let him.
In spite of all that has been said and
done by the earnest Murray Valley De-
velopment League and other interested
bodies, the recent census shows that the
Murray Valley population has fallen from
384,535 in 1933 to 362,388. Sydney’s
population in the same period increased
by 249,000. If ever there was an argu-
ment for a New State in Riverina
that’s it.
Found in Adelaide, a “Labor” man
with courage to say what he thinks. Last
month, during a debate on the Prices Bill
in the S.A. Assembly, P. H. Quirke said
“No Act attempting to control prices
under the economic set-up of Australia
or of any other country in the world
today has succeeded. It cannot possibly
be done.” Of the recent Referendum he
said, “The people made up their minds
and gave their decision, and I am person-
ally not sorry they gave the power to
the States. If there is one thing in the
world which is a curse it is the
centralising of power and industry.”
The remarks did not please the A.L.P.
in South Australia. An information was
laid and the State Council unanimously
declared Quirke guilty of disloyalty to the
party. Sentence: 12-months disqualifica-
tion. Quirke’s reaction was to resign his
membership.
“S. M. Herald” printed a statement ex-
plaining that a comment on the banking
case attributed to Senator Ashley had
actually been made by Senator Cameron.
Granny’s mistake is understandable ; it
is so easy to get confused over these
eminent banking authorities.
To seek reasons for the release of a
convicted criminal is “inconsistent with
the respect due to the King,” according to
Mr. Downing, N.S.W. Minister of Justice,
who explains that the Governor extends
the Royal mercy “only on the advice of
at least one of his Ministers, or, in capital
cases, on the advice of the Executive
Council.” Latest recipient of the Royal
mercy is a gunman who three years ago
received a death sentence which was com-
muted to 12 years’ penal servitude. He
is now out and about, much photographed
and reported and reputedly seriously ill
with t.b. Downing refused an Assembly-
man’s request for information, using the
foregoing excuse. Excuse it is. The
Governor’s right to pardon is not in ques-
tion. What is wanted is the Minister’s
reasons for recommending the release.
Manchester “Guardian,” commenting
on the banking case, could not see any
“economic reason” for the Chifley Gov
eminent to appeal, but “Mr. Chifley is
reputed to be obstinate and he may feel
he cannot admit defeat yet.” Obstinacy
has long been the privilege of mules, but
history records no instance of any mule
ever being successful as the head of a
Government.
These permanent “temporaries.” A
“Commonwealth Gazette” notice guaran-
tees about 200 temporary public servants
in the Re-establishment Division of the
Department of Postwar Reconstruction
that their jobs are safe until the end of
1950. They will “help administer the
scheme for rehabilitating physically-dis-
abled civilians.” Between now and
election-day next year the “Gazette”
will be printing lots of notices like that.
Canada is to have a tenth province—
Newfoundland. That “oldest British
colony,” which itself became a Dominion
in the terms of the Imperial Conference
declaration of 1926, could have joined
Canada any time since the British North
America Act came into force on July 1,
1867, but never thought of joining till
it fell on evil days in the ’thirties and
tried government by commission. As
part of strong and prosperous Canada it
should get over its difficulties. The
Anzacs met a contingent of Newfound-
landers on Gallipoli and pronounced them
good blokes.
U.S. and Canadian universities are
making big drives for funds. Harvard
aims at 90 million dollars, Montreal 11,
Toronto six and British Columbia half
a million. Quoting these figures,
Canadian Dr. Gibson, recently-appointed
Director of N.S.W. Mental Hospitals,
adds some nearer home—l2,ooo patients
in our asylums and not enough money to
establish even a decently-equipped neuro-
logical research laboratory. Since lot-
teries commenced running in 1931 they
have yielded a total surplus of over £l4
million. Lotteries are illegal in America
and Canada, and the university require-
ments will be subscribed. Here, until
“Governments” realise their responsi-
bility to provide and support research
and educational institutions, instead of
encouraging the money-for-nothing craze,
psychiatrists’ offices, as well as lotteries,
will have their queues.
Socialist Governments in Britain and
Australia differ in details, but in essen-
tials they are the same. Take their use
of paper, scarce as it is. Canberra churns
out enough forms, schedules, leaflets,
pamphlets and printed “information” to
keep a fair-sized publishing-house out of
newsprint troubles for a twelvemonth.
An official comparison tabled in the Com-
mons shows that an average annual figure
of 24,640 tons in the “Tory” thirties rose
to 51,180 tons last year, though
newspapers were reduced to skeleton
size.
Churchill at a Conservative rally:
Britain’s name and prestige have fallen
since the British nation fell flat on its face
in the moment of its greatest victory.
This possibility was foreseen by Glad-
stone in 1869:
Is England so uplifted in strength above
every other nation that she can with
prudence advertise herself as ready to
undertake the general redress of wrongs?
Would not the consequences of such pro-
fessions and promises be either the
premature exhaustion of her means or a
collapse in the day of performance?
“What did Mr. Gladstone say?” has be-
come a stock joke in this generation,
mockery of Victorian statesmen, writers
and philosophers having become one of
its pastimes. It would be heaps better off
had it remembered what he, did say.

“R.K.D.”; Without waiting for the
High Court’s decision in the banks case,
the “Wales” reopened its branch at
Lae (N-G.) —in a building down in the
coastal area. The Commonwealth Bank,
also reopened, is situated up the hill.
Neither has elaborate .premises, gal-
vanised-iron being the principal archi-
tectural feature of the “Wales.” The
“Wales” not so long ago had to send a

staff of the establishment on the high
ground smarted somewhat when they read
the inscription: “To Master bilong

Commonwealth boys: thought hard, then
wafted their acknowledgment down the
hill in an envelope addressed; “To
Mugs bilong likilik tin bank e stop along

“Clooter”: I don’t know who selects
the quotations for the daily sheets on my
desk calendar, but he seems to be gifted
with rare perception. His words for
Auguft 11, the day the High Court threw
out the Bank Bill, came from Beranger,
a French lyricist who witnessed the
French Revolution and the rise and fall
of Buonaparte: “Power is a bell which
prevents those who set it pealing from
hearing any other sound.” Mr. Chifley
could reflect upon this with profit while
the architect of the smashed banking
legislation cavorts beyond the seas,

“F.S.”:' Melbourne Gallery recently
renewed the insurance of the Van Eyck
Madonna for £BO,OOO. The original price
paid was £30,000, but an offer of £lOO,OOO
for the gemlike little picture was refused
by the trustees. Probably not one of
the Felton purchases of Old Masters has
been a mistake. The Gallery has one

of the greatest works of Rembrandt in
his self-portrait, one of the finest Rae-
burns in the “Admiral Deans,” a first-
class Tintoretto, “Doge Loredano,” and
it has Corots, Manets, Rodins, Turners,
and a good Titian, none of which is ever
likely to depreciate in value. In the con-
temporary field the record is vastly
different. The works of scores of
academicians and fashionable portrait-
painters, eminent in their time, have
been bought for fancy prices and sub-
sequently sold by auction when ousted
by the next New Look in artistic fashions.
The latest New Look is contemporary
English modernism, and an enormous
number of specimens has been pur-
chased lately. In 20 years’ time most of
them will be thrown out and people
will wonder why the trustees ever
bought them, just as present trustees
wonder why former trustees bought their
pictures. The Old Masters have been
bought on their prestige, not because the
trustees and their experts have under-
stood them. Men who understand the
Rembrandt couldn’t possibly like the
modern junk lately added to the col-
lection.

“Jasby”: Sydney “Sun” ran rather a
delightful cable story of a beach comedy
in Budapest. It told how a young brun-
ette came out of the water in full view
of a beach crowd before realising that she
had already emerged from the bottom half
of her bathing costume. Awakened
to her semi-nudity, she grabbed the
bath-robe off a man who happened
to be passing. That solved her
problem all right, but not his.
The robe was all he wore. The
yarn was welcome reading as evi-
dence that life behind the Iron Curtain
still has its brighter side, but it also threw
a light on the amazing changes Com-
munism has been able to effect in the
satellite countries. I knew the Comrades
were doing their best to make the Blue
Danube red, but had not realised that
they had changed the whole nature of
the river. According to the cable the
girl stepped “out of the salt sea waves.”

“Hamer”: Lajos Steiner, now appear-
ing for Australia in sundry big chess
shows in Europe (he ran third in a chess
masters’ tournament in Czechoslovakia,
and is now doing fairly well in the World
Interzonal contest at Stockholm), met a
man from Iceland who told him that he
hoped some day to visit Australia “and
see your King’s Cross.” The Bulletin’s
John Dailey would have been stirred to
hear that; John always maintained that
no other city of the world possessed any-
thing quite equal to “the Cross”; a
Bohemian quarter through which ran a
stream with a great part of the wealth
and high estate of the city; affluence
and poverty lawlessness and the staidest
respectability rubbing shoulders. Of
course, what in the old vernacular was
“the dirty half-mile” has long been a
subject of conversation in London and
New York —soldiers and sailors having
regarded it as the hub of Sydney’s gaiety
—and most new arrivals from overseas
announce their intention of “having a
look at The Cross” as soon as possible.
But I wouldn’t have thought its fame had
reached Iceland.

“Bo”; My neighbor has for years been
conducting a spasmodic feud with the
P.M.G.’s department over the authen-
ticity of calls booked against him on his
ever-increasing telephone bill. His gorge
finally rose and overflowed when he was
debited with a trunk-call to a neighbor-
ing State. Hot under the collar, he “had
them on,” emerging triumphant from the
verbal lists with a promise of a credit on
his next bill —the taxing machine known
as the postal department simply hates
handing back in cash what it has over-
charged—when it was established that the
call should have been charged to a number
another letter away in the alphabet.
Thereupon he decided to introduce his
own checking system. Alongside his
telephone he put two tins —one open and
full of pennies, one empty and sealed
but with a slot, and gave instructions to
his wife that whenever she made a call
she was to drop a penny in the slotted
tin. When one night his wife told him
the phone-bill was in he grabbed a tin-
opener and set to work. The tin yielded
240 pennies. He made rapid calculation.
“If that bill is a penny over thirty bob
for local calls/’ he vowed, “I’ll go down
There you are! I TOLD you you Weren't as bad as you thought."
and tear • the place to pieces! ” Then
with almost fiendish savagery he fell on
the envelope and ripped the bill out.
The total amount for calls was 7s. 6d.!

“X.S.” .on a problem for Solomon: —-
Two mothers separated by a screen had babies
within three minutes of one another in the
Kyneton District Hospital. Mother A alleges
that a few minutes later she saw a nurse carry
the two infants out of the ward and heard the
doctor say: “Are you sure you have those two
babies tagged, nurse?” Soon after a sister
presented to her an untabbed baby, dark-
skinned or dark-haired, which as it grew older
developed characteristics unlike herself, her
husband or her other children. She liked the
child, but when she chanced one day in Kyneton
to see mother B, who is brown-eyed, wheeling
a baby that was blue-eyed, fair-haired and fair-
skinned like her own husband and her children
her world seemed to topple over. She sug-
gested to mother B that she had the wrong
baby, but mother B said : “Oh, no! ” When
baby A was a year old she had blood-tests
taken of herself, the baby and her husband,
and they showed that, while she could have
been the mother of the baby, her husband could
not possibly be the father. The husband of
mother B refused to consider blood-tests for
his side of the problem. The mother of
mother A swore an affidavit that on the day
of the two births she had been shown a fair-
skinned infant as being the baby of her daugh-
ter. When her daughter returned home 10
days later she saw that the baby she brought
wasn’t that one. Subsequently she saw mother
B with a son and was instantly struck by the
likeness between him and the baby in charge
of her daughter. When she pointed out the
resemblance to mother B she received the reply
“Don’t be silly! ” Judge Barry granted a decree
nisi calling on mother B and her husband to
show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should
not be granted requiring them to surrender
baby B, now a child of three years.

“C. 8.”: A man in West Brunswick
(Vic.) applied to the Building Director-
ate for permission to erect a garage. No
flooring, no bricks, no cement or other
new material was to be used, and the
applicant was going to build the shack
himself out of secondhand material which
had been in his possession for years. His
only recent purchase was some roofing-
iron for which there was no priority. The
reply wa,s a roneoed statement that
“owing to the fact that this State is faced
with a deplorable deficiency in housing
and hospital accommodation and as every
effort is being made in the building trade
to alleviate this position, permission is
not now being given for the erection of
garages, workshops or outbuildings.”
* * * *
“Kelms”: “Bo” asks (B. 7/7/’4B) what
happens to the old metal between rail-
way tracks. Troop-train commandants
on the run across the Nullarbor had the
answer to that. It was pelted away by
travelling troops. At each stop, even for
only five minutes, they descended on the
ballast and transferred it 50 or 60 yards
north or south. The problem of replac-
ing it became serious, lectures were de-
livered on the offence and the trains were
policed. As far as I know the best brains
of the Army proved unequal to the task
of breaking the affinity which exists be-
tween the Australian soldier and peltable
blue-metal.
* * * ♦
“Gravelsnatcher”: Unfamiliarity with
the captor’s language (B. 30/6/’4B) landed
one p.-0.-w, in hot water. A city worker,
he found much at which to marvel on
the Bavarian farm to which he was
assigned. There he saw his first pig
killed and dressed. Killing a pig on a
Bavarian holding is an occasion for some
ceremony and much rejoicing, and the
butcher, dressed in white, with a cock-
feather hat and a huge belt bristling with
knives and steels, is feted liberally by
the host. The p.-0.-w. assisted to the best
of his ability, and when the dressing
reached the stage when the carcass was to
be immersed in boiling water, the farmer
called out “less waiter, Johan, iess
waiter,” and pointed through the stable-
door towards the house, where a huge
pot was boiling in the kitchen. The
p.-0.-w. grabbed a bucket and, urged on
by the urgency of his employer’s voice,
dashed outside, collected a few gallons
of ice-water from the tank and hurled
it over the pig. As the roof lifted to the
farmer’s angry roar, that p.-0.-w. took
off and broke evens towards the guard
compound, the farmer following with
an axe. He still thinks he’d have made
a good farmer if they’d given him an-
other chance.
* * * *
“0.R.”: “Bohemian” (B. 4/8/’4B) is a
long way out when he says that Foxton
is the first port in Maoriland to close
down permanently. Many ports closed
down years ago in that land of lost en-
terprises. What about Waikawa, in the
far south, where the remnants of six
wharves, standing out in a silted-up
harbor, testify that there was once plenty
of shipping? The quarries which pro-
vided a good deal of the porphyry for
Dunedin’s buildings closed down 60
years ago: there’s no longer any tall
millable kowhai along the creeks, and the
army of goldseekers who got a living
from the black sand of the beach no
longer need supplies, so Waikawa
withered away. A little further up the
East Coast there’s Tautuku, where the
wharf, even at half-tide, stands uselessly
on a mud-flat, attached neither to deep
water nor to the land. From there it isn’t
so far to the mouth of the Catlins River.
Newhaven stood there, and you can still
buy Admiralty charts showing the
beacons and the buoys and the shallow
channels of the abandoned port. Next
comes Port Molyneux, which hasn’t
handled any shipping for two generations.
If, instead of working your way north
from Waikawa, you go the other way
you will find more ghost ports—Fortrose
and a handful of others beyond the
Bluff, in Tewaewae Bay. All were once
prosperous, and in all of them the chan-
nels have silted up through denudation
of the hills and lack of use.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: For years standard
Navy lifesaving equipment has been the
carley float, a copper raft divided into
16 compartments and filled with cork.
It offered little protection from exposure.
Now the Admiralty is trying out a new-
type float. A development of the rubber
aircraft dinghy, and inflated by CO2 gas
under pressure, the float resembles a huge
motor-tyre, complete with tent, rubber
floor and cushions insulated from the cold
sea. Other features include visual and
radar aids to locating—the latter a re-
flector on top of a telescopic mast —plenty
of food, water and first-aid kit, and
bellows for topping - up buoyancy
chambers. Designed to support and
shelter 10 men even if only half-inflated,
the new float, with carrying valise, weighs
2001 b.
* * * #
“Jurumudi”: I wonder how the worthy
elders who object to double-meaning
telegrams at wedding breakfasts (B.
11/8/’4B) would get on at an old-style
Chinese wedding. I once attended the
marriage of a rich Penang merchant’s
daughter, and heard more of what in
Christian lands would be called porno-
graphy than you would hear at 10 com-
mercial-travellers’ smoke-ohs. It was obli-
gatory on each of the 400 or 500 guests:
as they filed past the happy couple, to
make a voluptuous suggestion, and it was
considered the thing for each to try to
outdo the last one. The object was to
stimulate fertility in the prospective
parents, in Chinese eyes an eminently
practical proceeding. The complete
absence of sniggering salacity would have
staggered the elders.
THE SNARLER.
“How to take reverses in good part is the least
of Premier McGirr’s political achievements.”
— “S. M. Herald.”
A very courteously-phrased reproof,
The sort of polished stricture you expect
Of commentators trained to keep aloof
From language more plebeian and direct,
A somewhat cumbersome periphrasis
It looks, into a mouthful to be taking,
Yet note, McGirr, it means no more than this:
Quit bellyaching!
When by-elections seem to queer your pitch
And make your prophecies an empty show,
Forbear this hackneyed carping at the rich —
You’re far from indigent yourself, you know.
Who crows when his opponents take the knock
Should be above emitting angry curses
And what is designated “doing his block”
Under reverses.
The Upper House, he tells us, is allowed
To set the people’s will aside. But still
When votes are cast against him and his crowd
They’re none so sure about the people’s will.
They like to picture folks who’ve gone astray
Pro tem, misled by propaganda cruel.
Pity, McGirr, you haven’t learned the way
To take your gruel.
In time no doubt will come the knowledge how
To meet untoward, sinister events,
That equanimity which Granny now
Fails to discern in your accomplishments.
Few politicians nowadays can skip
Or dodge their share of carkmg cares and
gnarling.
Heart up, McGirr! Stiffen your upper lip;
In short, stop snarling!

PERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEA
“T.L.”; The six-feet-six “Peter Lalor”
of fillum version of Eureka Stockade,
Chips Rafferty, has a ready wit, as wit-
ness his tag-reply in an interview with
one Terence Lambart, Queensland
radio’s only beard—a short, sharp goatee.
Following usual blah, the interviewer
struck a personal note, and asked the out-
size fellow for the recipe for growing
bigger and better ziffs. Chips replied that
he had no difficulty in growing face-
fungus ; his trouble was keeping silverfish
from destroying the appendage. Lambart
observed that he had not been bothered in
the same way. Rafferty’s rejoinder was:
“Well, mate, by the look of yours I’d
say the silverfish had had their fill.” No,
the patter was not scripted. I’m Lambart.
* * =i= ♦
“Pink Tape”: My friend O’Shirk, re-
cently of the Saucepan Lid Branch of
the Pots and Pans Control Department,
has always taken pains to use up every
day of the sick-leave to which he is
entitled. Not every public servant is
like that. Another chap went through
his entire 50 years’ service without being
sick for a day, thereby “losing,” in
O’Shirk’s opinion, nearly two years of
accumulated sick-pay. Then, just as he
started his long-service leave, he fell ill
and had a four-months sickness without
expense to the Government. O’Shirk
remarked to me scornfully that he would
never be a mug like that; he took the
last two days of sick-leave due to him on
the last week of his service. Although
he has his “superann.” and his wife has
saved well for their old age, O’Shirk is
somewhat pensive about his retirement.
“It’s a bit sad to reflect upon,” he told
me. “I’ll never again be able to stay
away from work on full pay.”
♦ * * *
“G. Iris”: A Melbourne cleric made
the statement some time ago that there
was not one member of the Federal
Government for whom he did not pray
every day. His task will be a heavy one
after redistribution, for the increased
number of members is bound to be made
an excuse for increasing the number of
Ministers. However, the parson qualified
his statement when he said, “But when
I read in ‘Hansard’ what they say, I
pray even more earnestly for the
people! ”
* * * *
“Pontius Penwiper”: At the next meet-
ing of the Poets’ Union I propose to move
that a petition be presented asking for
the change of the name of New South
Wales to something that can be fitted
better to poetic purposes. A “Hail,”
“O” or “My” placed before the Ma
State’s official monicker produces a line
that is flat, stale and generally unprofit-
able, and any attempt to “Arise” her is
even worse. A bard attempting to ex-
press an affection for his State like that
given in “Maryland, My Mary-
land” has to forget the name altogether
and fall back on “Land of Waratah” or
something like that. “Australia” is
better; and if that radio script-writer (B.
4/8/’4B) is still looking for a theme-song
he might try “Australia, Hail!” It’s fairly
melodious. About 50 years ago it was
advanced as something that might become
a national anthem; but its presentation
at the Sydney Cricket Ground by a
massed choir of school-kids killed it at
the jump. Dropping the “h” with
“Nothing like physical jerks. Miss Felix, to Warm you up. Try this one.”
terrifying unanimity the kids made it
sound like an advertisement for a new
beer.
* * * *
“Flip”: Into Sydney’s Martin-place at
lunchtime turned a massive black wagon
steered by a policeman. At rest, the
vehicle seemed to rise off its springs in
relief as other hefty gendarmes emerged
from the back. Twelve thudded down
and I cast my eye towards the near-by
Rural Bank building, wondering at the
foolishness of whoever was robbing it
when such a mechanised law-force as this
was abroad. There was a thirteenth
fellow in the truck —probably, I thought,
the ammunition man. As he passed to
the cops on the footpath their instruments
and music the gaping pedestrian-stream
began to flow again.
* * * *
“Zake”: When, during a heat of the
1000-metre Olympic .cycling sprint, two
competitors collided and crashed 20
metres from the finishing-line and officials
rushed out, placed one of the fallen on
a stretcher, carried him over the line and
tried to proclaim him the winner, even
announcing his time for the last furlong,
cables telling of it said that “this un-
ethical behavior, unparalleled in the
memory of Olympic officials, brought the
crowd to its toes in a wild demonstra-
tion.” Well! Well! Almost precisely
the same thing happened in the 1908
Games, also held in London. Leading
the field in the 26-mile Marathon, a
previously unknown Italian, Dorando
Pietri, collapsed a quarter-mile from
home. Officials rushed on to the track,
hoisted him up and carried him over the
fine just ahead of the American Hayes.
The Italian flag was run up to the mast-
head signifying a win to that nation. Up-
roar followed, and Hayes was later de-
clared winner. That and quite a few
other unsavory incidents were recalled by
an American writer in “Cosmopolitan”
some months ago in a quasi-humorous
appeal for the abolition of the Games be-
cause of the eternal bickering and inter-
national illwill they inevitably cause. This
latest of a lot of barneying and bad
sportsmanship certainly strengthens his
case.
* * * *
“Col M.”: The following piece
of advertising came from my radio
the other night, shoving a piece of
Tschaikowsky out of the way, and leaving
me wondering why I still cough up my
pound a year for a listener’s licence.
There was a telephone-ring followed by a
woman’s voice; “Oh, it’s you, Henry.
You’re bringing the boss home for
dinner? But, dear, you know I haven’t
a thing in the house. Oh, no, it will be
all right, I’ve thought of something.
Goodbye.” The woman then called in
her daughter, “Mary, I want you to go
to the grocer’s and get one tin of baked
beans and one of spaghetti.” “Any par-
ticular brand, Mummie?” “Of course,
you know I buy nothing but ‘Whosit’s.’ ”
I can just imagine the boss’s face light-
ing up as he sat down to that dinner.
* * * *
“D.A.L.”: Philip Lindsay’s reference
in his Hampton Court to Charles I being
“red-nosed, only sft. 2in. high and weak-
legged” (B. 14/7/’4B) reminds me that
the first portrait I saw of that monarch
was by a Dutch artist, Mytens, and
showed Charles as a little, thin-legged
man, with a weak face and a scrubby,
pointed beard —the reverse of the glam-
orous personality depicted by Van Dyck.
At the time I felt it must either be a crude
effort or a caricature, but it probably gave
a more honest idea of his actual appear-
ance than Van Dyck’s work.
* * * *
“Yipe”: A fresh-air fiend and con-
sumer of two glasses of water on rising
every morning, a friend of mine comes
of a family of health cranks and has
trained his young daughter not to kiss
people in greeting, but to raise her fore-
head to them. As the young lady has
passed the winter so far without a cold
he is very proud of his scheme. How-
ever, he did discover one slight hitch in
it recently when his brother brought the
family up from Adelaide. The brother s
youngster, also wise on osculatory
hazards, approached the other little girl.
Both presented their brows at the appro-
priate moment and the crack was like
something from a billiard-room.
* * * *
“Pawang”; A sufferer from numerous
imaginary complaints, I once wrote to
Coue (B. 28/7/’4B), whose little French
provincial clinic was then world-famous,
remarking, inter alia, that probably this
was the first time he had received a letter
from New Zealand. I got back a long
letter in which he stated that I was by no
means the first of his inquirers from those
parts and went extensively into the details
of my case and its treatment. There was
a warm human note about the epistle
which touched me profoundly, yet he
must have received thousands of similar
letters. I assiduously applied his “Every
day and in every way” formula, not only
to myself, but even more assiduously to
my baby, on the Coud assumption that
even infants can be affected unconsciously
by auto-suggestion. It did no good to
me, and it' would require a psycho-
analyst to unveil what influence it had
on the baby, but that proves nothing
against Coue,
* * * *
“Minto”: American troops had a lot
of trouble in understanding our currency.
I once shared a taxi from Townsville to
Garbutt airfield with a colored Yank. The
fare was only a few shillings, but as the
taxi slowed the darkie pressed a note into
the driver’s hand, slammed the door and
ran. The driver unfolded the note and
called to the vanishing Yank “Hey, you
gave me £10.” The darkie kept running
until he was at a safe distance, then called
back “I’m sorry, brudder, you’ll have to
whistle for de rest. Dat’s all ah’s got.”
* * * *
“Jeyduc”: Tiny (B. 7/7/748) had a
close rival for laziness: in Ossie, our unit’s
champion tired man. We had just pitched
camp, and there was the usual rush for
the best position in the tent. By the time
Ossie had mustered enough energy to
slink in the only place left was filled by
a tree-stump. Rather than strain himself
by attempting to move it, Ossie slept
curled in a. neat circle around that stump
for the five months of our stay.
* * * »
“W.P.T.”: Gas, rationing recalls the
fact that the first country town in N.S.W.
to be lit by gas was Bega, on the South
Coast. The date was October 2, 1885.
Bega still has its gasworks, but no longer
depends on it for lighting, nor does it
rely on coal for its electricity ; a hydro-
electric scheme brings power from
high up in the mountains not only to
Bega but to a number of other towns in
the district.
* * * *
“Jay Emma”: Joe has a habit of slip-
ping out of the office for a few quick ones
at the pub around the corner —a habit of
which the boss strongly disapproves. In
the bar the other day he struck an urger
in helpful mood. “Look,” he said, offer-
ing a couple of sweeter-breath tablets.
“Try these. Suck one on your way back
to the office and the boss won’t be able to
smell the grog on you.” “It’s not the
smell of my breath that worries me,”
replied Joe. “What I want is something
that’ll take the silly look off my face.”
GODIVA REDIVIVA.
“In the Coventry Council Chambers a Collier paint-
ing of historical Godiva riding her horse astride has
been joined by Landseer’s sidesaddle representation of
tb.e incident, creating considerable controversy.”
You’ve read in Tennyson’s mellifluous diction,
I take it, all about that famous ride
Staged in the interests of tax-restriction
By a grim Earl’s indomitable bride,
And ending with the terrible affliction
That overtook the Peeping Tom who tried
The civic ordinances to elude
And get a glimpse of beauty in the nude.
That stirring episode is mostly dated
To have occurred a thousand years ago,
Which makes it odd we should so long have
waited
For someone who can definitely throw
Light on the knotty problem now debated
Whether the lady rode astride or no.
Straddled her palfrey, or preferred to ride
A bit more femininely on the side.
To poets, dead-and-gone or still existent,
It doesn’t signify a tinker’s curse.
One cannot find the faintest or most distant
Ref’rence thereto in Tennysonian verse.
But artists should attempt to be consistent;
Nothing can tend to make confusion worse
Than these conflicting versions of the mode
Adopted by the Countess as she rode.
So now, when city dads have done concerning
Themselves with local needs, one may surmise
They find their eyes inevitably turning
To these two symbols of a past they prize,
And noisy arguments are heard, and burning
But doubtless amiable disputes arise
Just how Godiva looked upon the horse
That shared her memorable tour de force.

From Buda to Burma.
“Ek Bum”: The danger to
the world has become more
acute, and Soviet Russia hangs
over the West like an angry
black cloud erupting lightning.
Papers even in Sydney are be-
ginning to acknowledge what
has been repeated here for
weeks: Huge forces of Russian
troops are converging on the
Danube.
The London “Observer,” a
conservative and reliable
journal, reported on August 14,
and the staff correspondent of
the “S. M. Herald” relayed the
news, that 15 fully-equipped
Russian combat divisions are re-
ported to have arrived in
Hungary and Rumania along
with strong air support.
Hungary has been placed virtu-
ally on an occupation basis. The
Danube, in defiance of a long-
standing agreement, and the fact
that it is partly in the occupa-
tion zone of the Western Allies
and belongs largely to Austria
and Germany and to Russia not
at all, has been seized virtually
by force by Moscow and its
pack of satellites. Britain and
the U.S, have been pushed off
the commission. Threats and
hatred issue in a burning spate
from Moscow and other Russian
radios, which is making the most
of the events in New York.
For months Russian em-
bassies and consulates have been
in process of reduction through-
out the white world, while new
embassies and increased num-
bers of employees in existing
ones characterise relations with
Oriental countries which are in
the throes of revolution, Indo-
nesia included. The Communist
parties of the world are behav-
ing like automatons. What
Moscow says in the morning
they say in the afternoon,
despite an occasional sham fight
to deceive the gallery, such as
that which took place a few
■days ago between the Australian
and British parties’ The Aus-
tralians reproved the British
Communists for placing Britain
before Russia.
It was obviously meant to
assure the public that they were

Wouldn't it!"
independent bodies which make
their own local policies. They
are about as independent of
Moscow as some unfortunate
Latvian slave - woman in a
Siberian coalmine.
The release of the Soviet
schoolteacher, Mrs. Kosenkina,
in New York, gives a pretty
picture of Russian methods. She
fled to a camp run for refugees
by Countess Tolstoy. From there
she was taken by Russian
officials, by force apparently, to
the Russian Consulate-General.
The Russian Consul-General
held her up at press conferences,
at which she sat silent, white and
fidgeting, as having been res-
cued from White Russian ban-
dits and their allies of the F. 8.1.
Much of the world press showed
an inclination to tinge this story
with a flavor of belief. And
then the poor wretch jumped
50ft. out of a window on to a
concrete pavement. And it came
out that she had been held
prisoner by her countrymen and
would sooner suicide than go
home. The sinister and deter-
mined efforts of M. Molotov
and the Russian Ambassador to
the United States, M. Panyush-
kin, to get her again into their
clutches speak for themselves.
They probably do not care
twopence whether they have
another slave or two to send to
Siberia or another corpse to
bury—their toll of human life
runs into tens of millions. But
they do care for the poor lady
as a pawn in the game of in-
flaming the hate of the East
against the West and of promot-
ing the cause of world Com-
munism. Their distorted version
of the case is being broadcast
throughout Asia with every im-
plication which it is thought will
stir the inhabitants to the mur-
der or expulsion of the white
peoples.
Meanwhile, the revolutionary
movements of southern Asia go
on apace, fanned, if not directed
(as is believed in Malaya and
said openly there by the press),
by the Australian Communist
party.
No white is safe in Malaya,
and amid the applause from the
Australian Communists and
dead silence from Mr. Chifley
and his fellow-members of the
Canberra “Labor” camp another
Australian and several loyal
Malays and Chinese were mur-
dered during the week. And
another group of miserable refu-
gee women and children made
these shores fleeing for their
lives from Chinese murderers
whom Australian Communists
hail as arbiters of freedom. The
victims are sneered at as the
agents of Collins House capital-
ism—a capitalism which pro-
vides Australia with tin and rub-
ber, which will all pass to Rus-
sian and Communist ownership,
to our loss, if these rebels win.
The Canberra Government is
wordless in the face of the mur-
der of its nationals. It is almost
impossible to believe that any
Administration of the white race
should adopt the attitude which
it has taken. It has not a
word to say for itself, not an
expression condemnatory of
what is taking place except for
mumbled, shamefaced promises
which mean nothing, and which
it knows mean nothing, when it
is cornered by the press.

Gas, as a lighting medium, was first
employed by William Murdock, in
England, in 1792. Some twenty years
later the first public coal-gas lamps
were installed on Westminster Bridge,
London. In 1886 the incandescent
mantle, introduced by Dr. Welsbach,
replaced the “fishtail” type of burners
and completely revolutionised the
application of coal gas for lighting
purposes.
Gas was a vast improvement on pre-
ceding methods of indoor and outdoor
lighting, hut, in turn, gave way to
the more convenient and otherwise
superior electric light, as exemplified
to-day by Osram Electric Lamps.

The Old Fifteenth.
“Ek Dum”: It took the old
Fifteenth Battalion, A.1.F., a
long time to write its life history,
but it is out at last. It was one
of the first of the great battalions
formed in World War I. It
was a product of enthusiasm,
for it was evolved almost out of
necessity to mop up some of the
mass of Queenslanders who were
surging to the recruiting depots
during September and October,
1914. Private L. C. E. Ropple-
man, a Tasmanian, claimed to be
its first man, enlisted on Sep-
tember 5. Privates J. N. Nichol-
son and C. H. Burslem fol-
lowed, but the battalion did not
actually come into existence
until the Gympie, Maryborough
and Toowoomba boys were
moved into Enoggera when the
pioneer Ninth Battalion, built on
the foundation of the old More-
tons, who were long in the tooth
and well grown out of their
scarlet, had departed for Mel-
bourne to join the Third
Brigade.

St n H

August’ 8, 1915, during the
assault on Hill 971 on Gallipoli,
and Cyril Corset; Lieutenants
Kessel, N. T. Svensen, C. E.
Snartt, L- N. Collin (killed on
May 9, 1915), L. G. Casey, .
Robertson and F Moran. On
September 27 Lieutenant-
Colonel J. H. Cannan, of the
Oxley Battalion, became CO.
with Mainr Rprt Carter 2 i/c
with Major Bert Carter as 2 i/c.
Thus the six Queensland com-
panics formed the pioneer base,
and the two Tasmanian com-
pames (“G” and “H”) came
into being in October under
Major Eccles Snowdon and
Captain H. C. Davies. With
“G” company was Second-Lieut.
N. Dickson, the first officer of
the battalion to be killed in
action. His companion, Second-
Lieut. A. H. Hinman, was also
killed in action.
In November the Queensland
companies were railed to Broad-
meadows (Vic.) to join Monash’s
Fourth Brigade. And on Dec.
22, 1914, five days after they
had marched through the streets
of Melbourne, they embarked on
the old Ceramic, 18,500 tons,
then the Queen Elizabeth of the
Australian trade. On February
1, 1915, they arrived in Alex-
andria Harbor, saw themselves
reorganised in the new four-
company formation, enjoyed the
not of April 2 very much and,
about 9 p.m. on April 10,
marched to Zeitoun and em-
barked for Gallipoli on the See-
ang Bee and the Australind ■
the best- and worst-tuckered
ships of the Gallipoli convoy.
A fortnight later they were
hanging in two detachments off
the Peninsula listening to the
preliminary noises of the A.LF.’s
first battle, the doughty mem-
bers of “C” company playing
a cheerful game invented by
poor Harry Byrne (killed at
Quinn’s on May 9), in which
cards were dealt till the Curse
of Scotland turned up as a sup-
posed indication that the collec-
tor would be the first man killed
—he wasn’t. The Curse fell on
young Percy Toft, who survived
the war.
“A” company was first ashore
bound for Courtenay’s Post, and
with its landing—it had its first
casualty from shrapnel before
it had touched Turkish soil —
began a glorious battalion career
which makes sad reading in
retrospect to anybody who be-
longed to the generation of these
gallant lads and finds, as his
eye works down the tightly-
printed lists at the end of the
book, name after name of
boyhood friends “killed in
action” and “died of wounds,'’
and thinks of the might-have-
been, for many of them had
bright minds, high hearts and
spirits, and two or three had
more than a touch of genius.
On Gallipoli alone or at sea
and base hospitals the battalion
had 439 killed in action alone,
with 111 died of wounds, 520
wounded in action and 18
p.-0.-w. The measure of the
losses can be made from officer
casualties. The original officers
numbered 33, but on Gallipoli
20 were killed and 27 wounded.
Lost were poor Hughie Quinn,
of Quinn’s Post, Jack Walsh, the
cool-headed leader of the land-
ing, Herman Cannan, an old
Oxley man, S. W. Harry, poor
Tom Robertson, decoyed with
his section by a German officer
posing as a British major, H. P.
Armstrong, Frank Armstrong, a
S. African veteran. Captain
Luther (the fearless surgeon of
the battalion), E. G. Wareham,
H. G. W. Smith —shot to pieces
in the decoy affair in which
Robertson was lost.
To the 1095 total casualties
of Gallipoli—casualties in a
single battalion were added
many more at Pozibres and
Moquet Farm, in the Great
Somme Winter and Goeudecourt
and Lagnicourt, at Templeux-la-
Fosse, in the big push of 1918,
at Hamel, where Dalziel won the
battalion’s V.C., and at Lihu
Farm and Jeancourt. The
Fifteenth lost a C.O. in Lt.-
Colonel T. P. McSharry, C.M.G.,
D.S.O. and M.C. and Bar. Its
total casualties were 1195 killed
and 2487 wounded, but it has
always looked on Gallipoli as
its campaign.
The Fifteenth was generally a
battalion apart. There was an
unruly air about it. It was hard
to manage except in battle, full
of high spirits and devilment,
the plague of spit-and-polish
generals, though smart in its own
way, and with its own kind of
discipline. Especially in its
early days, it seemed to be made
up of a special race of men, with
a remarkable leaven of both
military and civil ability.
Its original C. 0., Jim Cannan,
lived to be general-manager
of a big insurance company and
to act as Quartermaster-General
throughout World War 11.
Others were found rising high in
civil life where there was fight-
ing to be done —T. B. Heffer,
one of its badly-wounded officers
of the period of France, who
has just gone through the battle
of bank nationalisation as G.-M.
of the Bank of New South
Wales; Norman Mighell, Com-
monwealth Coal Controller dur-
ing the last years of the Second
World War; and Senator Bur-
ford Sampson, who represented
Tasmania in the Senate forbears.
Nearly 5000 men passed
through the rolls, and well on to
four-fifths of these became
actual battle or trench casualties.
The list of decorations won
is imposing—a V.C., 11 D.S.Os.
(plus two Bars), 28 M.Cs. (plus
two Bars), 28 D.C.Ms., 162
M.Ms. among a total of 345.
But to be a member of the
Fifteenth was in itself almost
equivalent to be decorated,
especially in that period in
France when the battalion habi-
tation was such that one member
resigned his possie under
“shelter” to be a driver, with
the indignant remark that he
had “not enlisted to become a
something yabbie.”
They were a clannish lot, and
their corporate spirit congealed
as late as 1935 in the Angels
Remembrance Club to perpetu-
ate the memory of the battalion
dead and the traditions of the
battalion. Out of this almost
mystic brotherhood arose the
2/15th Welfare Club, which
raised more than £6OOO for the
benefit of men and dependants
of the younger generation. At
the annual Anzac March in Bris-
bane—sometimes Tasmanians
make special journeys to be there
—a regular ritual is observed
with the president of the Angels
Remembrance Club, irrespective
of rank, leading the column and
the battalion V.C., Driver Harry
Dalziel, carrying the flag.
Long may they continue to
march!

100 YEARS BETTER
PERSONAL ITEMS
Deep-sea diver Jim Johnson, anxious
to have another crack at sunken
Niagara’s has spent most of his
career in a diving-suit; the smell of pres-
surised rubber and the clutch of a suit
are the principal smells and feelings of
his life. He has dived all over the world,
wherever the dead ships lie, but his
deepest dive—and the world’s—was on
Niagara, still lying with £150,000-worth
of gold in her bullion-room under 440 ft.
of water off New Zealand. At this depth
in an ordinary suit Johnson would have
been pulped; so he designed a bell to
withstand the crushing pressure. Along-
side Niagara, lying with two great holes
gouged in her side from mines, it was
pitch-black, and a specially-designed
lamp, comprising six powerful red globes
which diffused a glareless glow like a
red-hot poker, was lowered. In its light
Johnson directed the grab scooping up
thousands of pounds worth of gold in
one clutch. After Niagara next job was
diving op war wrecks in the Hoogly,
followed by Wanganella. Here, as in his
second attempt on Niagara, labor costs
and hours worried him. Johnson has
vitriolic ideas on the 40-hour week and
its application to salvage —where time
and tide certainly wait for no man,
Lachlan Macquarie: His Life and
Times has gained for Malcolm Ellis (The
Bulletin’s “Ek Dum”) the Harbison-
Higinbotham Research Scholarship
awarded by Melbourne University for
“the best thesis of the year based on
original research in history, science, eco-
nomics, politics, government or adminis-
tration” —the book probably qualifies
under every one of those heads. The
award is not the first to come Ellis’s way.
In 1940 he collected a Prior Memorial
Prize and two years later was chosen by
Queensland University to deliver the
Macrossan Memorial Lectures. Although
recognised as the authority on the Mac-
quarie period, Ellis is not a one-subject
man. His long string of publications in-
cludes Express to Hindustan, an account
of a motor trip across Europe and Asia ;
The Red Road, an exposure of Com-
munism in Australia; and, for further
variety. The Beef Shorthorn in Australia.
Also due for early publication is a life
of Macquarie’s architect, Francis Green-
way.
Captain Henry Mackay Burrell, re-
cently appointed to command H.M.A.S.
Australia, is remembered by thousands
of former Navy men as commanding
officer of destroyers Norman and
Bataan; recently he has been Deputy
Chief of Naval Staff. He has had many
proud moments in his naval career, but
perhaps the greatest was when he visited
the C.-in-C. at Portsmouth, Admiral Sir
William (“Bubbles”) James, on Nelson’s
old flagship Victory prior to taking the
Norman to sea. After being “piped
aboard” he was conducted to the Ad-
miral’s quarters in Nelson’s aft cabin. It
was very small and low—so low that
Burrell had to stoop to enter it —and its
fittings were a quaint mixture of old and
new. Nelson’s desk, the light brackets
and other fittings of the year of Trafalgar
were there, and among them all a tele-
phone was playing an important part in
the conduct of a modern war, while in
the next' cabin a typewriter tapped in-
cessantly.
As he admits in Across the Years
(reminiscence-essays on books, book-col-
lecting, bookselling and the like in Aus-
tralia, got together by Charles Barrett),
Jim Tyrrell has now been dealing in
books, pictures, antiques, coins and curios
for upwards of 58 years. He started
in a three-rooms-upstairs-three-downstairs
secondhand bookshop which a Scot with
the conseederable name of David Mac-
kenzie Angus had opened in Market-street,
Sydney (joined a year or two later by
another Scot, George Robertson; the
beginning of Angus and Robertson’s). Jim
Tyrrell didn’t stick to Sydney ; he was in
Adelaide when his friends C. J. Dennis

a gem of a book on early Sydney shortly
due from Waite and Bull’s printery.
“Trinco”: If wealth counts for any-
thing in Hyderabad’s fight for indepen-
dence against India, the Moslem State
should win in a canter —the wealth of
Osman, its present Nizam, is generally
accepted as making Rockefeller and
Henry Ford comparative paupers. His
estimated assets are somewhere in the
neighborhood of £650,000,000; his in-
come, close on £7,000,000. The Nizam’s
jewel collection includes the Jacob
diamond, used by his father as a paper-
weight, a large camel-shaped diamond
and a unique set of emeralds. As for his
pearls, the Hyderabadis’ boast that their
ruler could lay a pearly path from
Charing Cross to Oxford Circus is not
much of an exaggeration. He also owns
the world’s largest gold table-service, a
complete set for 150 people. With all his
lucre, the world’s wealthiest man lives in
a comparative shack, most of the space
in which is taken up by his treasures.
Like four other Indian princes, he is

Being carried in the U.S. Presidential
elections this year for the sixth time by
Norman Thomas, the socialist banner has
in the past attracted as many as 884,781
votes (1932) and as few as 80,518 (1944)
without ever looking like a winner. Per-
haps Thomas (a most sincere old worker
in the cause, and greatly respected for it)
is partly impelled this time by the innate
American urge to crack records: his
Socialist forerunner, Eugene V. Debs, had
five shots at the Presidential title.
Tribute paid last week by the Com-
mander of Convoys, Rear-Admiral Sir
James Somerville, to Captain D. R.
Macfarlane, war-time skipper of mer-
chantman Sydney Star, in an Admiralty
report on Malta convoys will jog
memories in our destroyer crews, parti-
cularly Nestor’s. Sydney Star, carrying
troops, armored vehicles and supplies,
collected an E-boat’s torpedo on July 24,
1941, south of Sicily. Nestor slid along-
side and took off her troops, then stood
by and fought off bombers most of the
way to Malta. Commander A, S.
Rosenthal of Nestor won a D.S.O. for this
effort. The two ships next met five months
later in a convoy bound for Alexandria,
under similar bombing conditions, though
Sydney Star managed to swing away from
her particular packet. Navy men, well-
armed with speed and guns, have always
rated merchantmen’s guts highly, parti-
cularly those in the Med., and this recog-
nition of the “judgment, initiative and
good seamanship” of a gallant skipper
will receive the Service’s approbation.

mainly with crime in the North
Sydney area. Promotion to det.-inspector
gave him control of No. 4 Division,
which includes the wharf-pillage squads
and water police (in the latter force, inci-
dentally, recruits are badly needed, ex-
naval men with diving experience particu-
larly acceptable). Though he’s solved
much bigger cases, Regan’s favorite one
concerns a North Shore robbery and
bashing, on the scene of which he
picked up a torn envelope, address
missing, but carrying figures which
he deduced as domino scores, under
the players’ initials. These fitted two
local cracksmen, and a pub-owner proved
they’d played a game the afternoon of
the crime. Result, three years apiece—
won in a domino game. The inspector
found that most criminals, confronted
with the evidence, take what’s coming
philosophically. He bears no grudge
against the few that beat him. “They’ll
come again.” They do.

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
The soft flurry of velvet and satin
gowns, the rustle of taffetas and the
sparkle of many jewels ushered in the
premiere of the Italian Grand Opera
season. One of the loveliest gowns was
worn by,Mrs. Frank Tait. Of powder-
blue taffeta, it had the off-the-shoulder
line; the wide bouffant skirt was caught
up at the back and swished into a train.
With it was worn long detachable sleeves
just above the elbows. Cecil Tait’s gown
of silver-grey had ruchings of powder-
blue outlining the low-cut bodice. Mrs.
Gordon Tait chose a gown of midnight-
blue satin. To her trained gown of black
satin Mrs. Guy Hutchinson added a long
cape of silver-fox. With their fair hair
and long white frocks Robin Carmichael
and Anne Williams conjured visions of
a pair of Botticelli angels. Mrs. Bill Mc-
Dermott’s white crepe gown had shoe-
string shoulder-straps. Mrs. Myer Suther-
land twined blue ribbon in her Grecian
hair-do, which suited well her blue-and-
silver lame gown.
Mrs. George Armstrong, daughter-in-
law of the late Dame Nellie Melba, wore
a gown of white crepe under a mink coat;
her necklace was of diamonds and rubies.
Her daughter, Mrs. Pamela Vestey, was
smart in garnet-red velvet and small
shoulder-cape of mink and white ermine.
Mrs. Jim Tait’s black taffeta gown was
draped and bustled, her long gloves of
fine black lace. Mrs. Erl Grey’s gown of
orchid-satin was worn with a white;
ermine jacket. Lady Knox’s gown was
of eau-de-nil satin. Diamonds gleamed
against Lady Fraser’s black gown. Mrs.
John Kaufman’s white crepe gown was
embroidered in gold and worn under a
mink coat. Her niece, Clare Robb, also
chose white for her gown. Mrs. Ron
Findlay’s bustle gown was of white moire
taffeta. Mrs. Ronald Marriott chose a
bouffant gown of black tulle worn with
a silver-fox cape.
A luncheon was given by Mrs. H. R.
Hamer, acting-president, and the com-
mittee of the Queen Victoria Hospital,
to welcome home Lady Brookes, the
hospital president, on her return from
England. The newly-furnished and
-decorated board-room of the hos-
pital, with its ivory walls and aqua-
blue ceiling as contrast to the chintz-
covered chairs and the deep-burgundy
carpet, was the setting. Lady Brookes
wore a winter-white boater hat trimmed
with black-velvet ribbon with her black
ensemble. Mrs. Hamer matched her
navy suit with a hat which carried
feather trimmings. Mrs. Arthur Wen-
zel, whose floral decorations were
admired, wore a huntcr’s-green frock,
off-the-face amber felt hat and a dyed-
ermine hip-length coat. Mrs. Albion
Walkely’s ensemble was black; her black
hat was highlighted with a powder-blue
grosgrain ribbon bow. Mrs. F. H.
Wright’s black Indian-lamb coat was
worn over a black frock. Mrs. Robert-
son Smith’s black frock had a turquoise-
blue beaded yoke.
Despite the high wind hats came out in
the full flower of their gaiety at Caul-
field. Mrs. Norman Robinson, wife of
the V.A.T.C. chairman, wore a brightly-
trimmed black hat with her fawn jacket-
suit. Mrs. K. McLean’s choice was a
navy jacket-suit and a small matching
hat trimmed with multicolored ribbon.
Mrs. T. B. Pickman’s-navy tailored coat
was topped with a navy cloche hat made
secure with a tight face-veil. Another
wearer of navy was Mrs. S. Stutt; her
hat was of maroon felt, her furs silver-
fox. Mrs. Lindsey Mildred's old-gold
jacket-suit was worn with a brown hat
which had a swathing of old-gold ribbon.
Mrs. Harold Rabling wore a French
hand-made lace blouse with her navy-
and-white-pin-striped suit; her crownless
hat was fashioned of off-white looped
straw. Mrs, A. L. Walters wore a hat of
hunter’s-green felt with her London-tan
tailored tweed suit. Alice Adcock wore
Scots tweeds checked in blue and beige.
Mrs. Leslie Stuart, from Jerilderie
(N.S.W.), chose a wool jacket-suit in
electric-blue; her matching hat was
feather-trimmed. Mrs. Harvey Picken
wore brown furs with her brown tailored
suit and hat. Mrs. B. J. Hattam’s en-
semble and small hat were black. A
dyed-ermine coat covered Wyn Kellow’s
grey suit. Mrs. D. Ross’s sage-green coat
had a mole-fur collar. Mrs. E. Newbigin
added Kolinsky furs to her black suit;
her off-the-face hat was of black felt.
An unusual exhibition of works of art
was opened at Georges’ Gallery by Brian
Jones of the British Council. Instead of
the usual collection of pictures there were
Ascher squares, examples of modern tex-
tile art designed by leading French
painters. Among the famous designers
were Jean Cocteau, Henri Matisse and
Marie Laurencin. Gay in color and
dramatic in design, the squares could be
used as scarves to uplift a dull frock; a
few joined together would make a frock.
The National Gallery bought 24 of the
designs; these will be sent on tour to
country Centres where young students are
doing modern textile-designing. John
Heath went to the opening with Mrs.
Esmond Lillies. Others admiring the art
were Joan Mercer, whose pale-beige
frocking and matching beige-tulle draped
hat were admired ; Mrs. Fradel Walters in
a black Persian-lamb-trimmed coat and
spring hat of pastel-pink and black
adorned with pink briar-roses; Mrs.
Walter Prillinger, wife of the Ascher rep-
resentative in Australia, in beech-brown
tweed suit and matching grosgrain-ribbon
toque; Mrs. G. Garand, displaying the
Marie Laurencin scarf she was sending
to her husband in New York ; and Kath-
leen Minahan, who combined black
ribbon and pink roses to make a smart
hat which she wore with a tailored black
coat.
Here is Mrs. T. J. Dowd, one of Aus-
tralia’s corset experts, and executive of the
organisation which bears her name. She
has two sons, Maurice and Bernard, who
are married. Keenly interested in the wel-
fare of the girls who work in her factory,
she plans picnics for them at her Heales-
ville home, and the barbecues in the
garden are quite events. She is one of
Melbourne’s best-dressed women.
Cries of “Viva! ” and “Bravo! ” greeted
Signor and Signora Ghione and members
of the Italian Opera company when they
arrived at the welcome buffet-dinner ar-
ranged for them at the Oriental by the
Italo-Australian hospitality committee.
Mrs. Stansen, who received the guests
with her husband, who is president of the
hospitality committee, wore a white mara-
bou cape over her draped gown of white
crepe starred with small golden motifs.
Party found many members of the Tait
clan together, among them Nevin and
daughter Mary and Frank and his beauti-
ful wife. Mrs. Sam Wood wore a black
tulle gown and short white Arctic-fox
jacket. With Mrs. Wallace Mitchell was
Mrs. Fleming Dunstan, who, just returned
from abroad, waxed enthusiastic over
petite Rina Malatrasi, who is famous for
her singing of “Butterfly.” Other guests
included Mrs. D. Stewart, Lilian Wight-
man, the Eric Averys and Mesdames J. J.
Daly and A. A. Lord.
Mrs. R. G. Casey made bright speech
when she opened the mannequin parade
at the Australia, organised by Mrs. W. K.
Burnside for the Almoner Auxiliary of
the Royal Melbourne Hospital. A parade
which featured clothes and hats designed
by Australians to be worn by Australians
she found encouraging, but she thought
it was time hats strapped firmly to the
head were designed for Melbourne winds.
Very often, she went on, “an insecurely-
anchored hat in our city is as appropriate
as an Eskimo in a dirndl,” and Melbourne
women will heartily echo the sentiment.
Mrs. Casey wore a black cloque dinner-
suit. Mrs. Burnside was in hibiscus-red
crepe with matching sequin trimming.
Mrs. Daryl Lindsay chose black chiffons.
Powder-blue was Mrs. Ken Burnside’s
tailored gown. Mrs. Olive Thring’s black
gown had masses of silver sequins grouped
on the bodice. Mrs. P. L. Coleman’s gown
of pastel-pink marquisette had the skirt
banded in black Chantilly lace with the
lace repeated on the full cap sleeves.
Multicolored sequin butterflies splashed
the bodice of Mrs, Fred Irvine’s black
gown. Mrs. A. Colman wore a dyed-
ermine coat with her black gown. The
pastel-pink broderie Anglaise gown worn
by Zara Davis had touches of powder-
blue on the skirt and bodice.
From Sydney
Fearlessly stepping past the brass
cannon on the steps of the Officers’ Mess
at Victoria Barracks Igst Saturday after-
noon, guests went into the five-thirty-
onwards party. Anyway, why should
they be afraid? They were almost all
staff officers and their wives. Everything
about this party radiated good nature.
Spring had come in with the daffodils on
the long buffet-tables. The only wall-
flowers in the rooms were the horticultural
ones arranged in squat, plump bowls.
That’s one thing about going to a
Barracks party —there are always plenty
of men around. Lieut.-General Berry-
man, just back after his English journey,
looked happy, for though it’s nice to
travel it’s nice to come home, too. Mrs.
Berryman smiled beneath a large upswept
black hat. Her tailored suit was black,
her furs platina fox.
Anne Berryman rather suggested a daf-
fodil herself with her pale-gold hair and
her green-velvet suit. The turquoise-blue
suit, with its short jacket and pleated
skirt, worn by the wife of Colonel Mann
was among things admired. Colonel
Hyman and Mrs. Hyman were there; her
yellow hat had golden feathers falling
over the edge of the brim. Colonel
Ryrie and his wife had dashed to the
party in their new car. Major Dimond
and Mrs. Dimond, Captain and Mrs. lan
Spain, Major R. R. S. Hickson and Mrs.
Hickson, Mrs. J. E. Stevens, Colonel
Anderson and his wife from North Head,
Corps Commandant Major Mills and Mrs.
Mills, Brigadier Pulver, who had seen so
nobly to the commissariat, were among
the comers and goers. June Martin
and fiancd Lt. Phillip Greville were
among the glimpsed.
Grace Perry, the girl of this photograph,
is senior social secretary for the Medical
Society this year, and she is working
nearly as hard for the success of the
Medical Ball as for her own fourth-year
medical exams. The ball is) dated for
September 21, which is a Tuesday. Mrs.
H. R. Dew, wife of the Dean of the
Faculty of Medicine, is president of the
committee. Decorations will be in the
university colors —blue and gold and
there will be masses of blossom in all the
colors of spring. Incidentally, Grace has
many interests in addition to medicine.
She is a clever pianist and a writer of
lyric verse.
Stepping into the party given by Nor-
way’s Minister Lars Hvinden Jorstad and
his wife wasi like seeing an animated map
of the world unrolled before you. Under
the roof of these friendly hosts one night
last week were grouped almost all the
peoples of the world in the persons of
their Ministers and Consuls. The Nor-
wegian Minister and his wife have re-
cently moved into a spacious flat on the
ninth floor of Macleay Regis’, and the
revels were something of a house-warm-
ing. The night air was soft for August,
and the harbor view from the balconies —
the scarcely-moving waters, the arch of
the Bridge and reflected lights—was
worthy a lyric.
The large reception-room was bright
with candlelight. Especially notable were
the two tall, plump, curly, lighted white
candles which stood by the fireplace.
They were in brass candlesticks standing
on stools, and everywhere were spiky
sprays of pink-flowering peach. As at all
the Jorstad parties, the supper dishes,
many of them Norwegian, were luscious.
Among the strong waters was’ Norway’s
national spirit. This is taken at one
draught. A snow scene painted by a
Norwegian artist dominated the walls.
Lucent-white was worn by the hostess'.
The slightly-spreading skirt of thick
moire was topped by a lace jacket girdled
in silver. A spray of blue and white hya-
cinths and a pearl coronet were attractive
touches. Mrs. Woo, the small, slim wife
of China’s Minister, wore her national
dress! in thick black silk. The wife of
France’s Consul-General, Mrs. de la
Croix, chose dove-grey. U.K.’s Trade
Commissioner Adams and his wife were
there, also knight Harry Moxham and his
wife, her frock of rich, white moire, the
bodice thickly crusted in white sequins.
The Philip Bushells', whose daughter
Pam and her husband are now stationed
at Trieste, Dr. Grant Lindeman and his
wife in graceful black chiffons, and Con-
sul for Mexico Zalapa and his wife, and
Mrs. Koch, who went on with Den-
mark’s Consul Hergel and Mrs. Hergel
to the Danish Society’s party at the Pick-
wick Club, were a bright group. Greece s
Dr. Vrisakis and Mrs’ Vrisakis, she
sparkling in sapphire blues, the Nor-
wegian Consul-General Hofgaard and his
pretty wife, tall Miss D. Danielsen, of the
Norwegian Legation, Canadian agricul-
tural expert Dr. W. P. Hopper and Mrs.
Hopper, who will be missed when they
return to Ontario in October, were noted
in the crowded and laughter-filled recep-
tion-rooms.
The little Junior Red Crossers are up
to their old tricks, and very pretty and
useful ones they are. All visitors to the
J.R.C. exhibition in the Town Hall today
can judge for themselves, for in the lower
hall the children’s work will be dis-
played. These are the gifts they have
made during the past 12 months for the
children of invalid ex-servicemen. There
will be a morning session at which Mrs.
John Northcott, president of J.R.C., will
be present, and an afternoon one at
which the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bartley,
will preside. There will be a pageant,
too, featuring the historic and inter-
national aspects of J.R.C.
One thousand and fifty people —
members of the Overseas League, the
Royal Empire Society and the Victoria
League—squeezed and sidled their way
into the Trocadero last Wednesday after-
'noon to greet Sir Laurence and Lady
Olivier and members of the Old Vic.
Company. Knight Henry Manning, vice-
president of the Overseas League, presi-
dent of the Royal Empirians F. E.
Manning, and Mrs. Manning, Mrs.
Harold Nicholas of the Victoria League
and E.-S.U.’s president Aubrey Halloran
met the guests and sat with them at the
official table. Members of the council
and the committee of the various groups
had a perch on the red carpet, their
tables being just within the aura of the
Great,
Laurence wore a brown lounge-suit; his
wife wore a black frock. This was re-
lieved from sombreness by a glimmer of
pearls, and pink wings in her tiny mush-
room-pink hat. The Governor’s daughter,
Elizabeth Northcott, smiled over the
flowers presented by Kathleen Gaden of
the Overseas. Beth’s small beige Arctic-
fox jacket was a handsome adjunct on a
cold August day. In company with
Elizabeth was Sheila Collett, her frock
softly grey, her hat sapphire-blue,
Laurence spoke words full of friendli-
ness, and of appreciation for kind-
ness and friendship received by him
and members of his company, a friend-
ship that surges out to the whole of Eng-
land from Australian kinsmen and
-women. Lady Olivier, who spoke after
Sir Laurence, raised her voice in protest
against the possible pulling-down of the
House of Parliament and the Old Mint —
in her opinion Sydney’s two loveliest
buildings. Concluding note was
Laurence’s remark about the old family
custom of joining in a cup of tea. Then
he and Vivien stepped down from the
stage to drink the communal cup, but
found, like everybody else, that the brew
was coffee.
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere. and her . com-
mittee, whicff includes almost every well-
known smart and pretty woman in
Sydney, have sent out invitations to the
Black-and-White Ball. The invitations,
designed by Mrs. Ernest Watt, show her
usual grace and imagination. If you
accept you get a ticket for the ball at
the cost of 255., which goes to aid the
Royal Sydney Industrial Blind Institution,
William-street. The ball will be held
in the Trocadero on October 5. Mrs. M.
Murray at the Auxiliary Office, Endeavour
House, Macquarie-place, will arrange pre-
ferential booking.
Sheila Macdonald, an enthusiast at her
profession, writes details of the nrs
Occupational Therapy dance, this is
named the Spring Fever Ball, and is date
for September 14 at Christy’s. The dance
has been organised by the Occupationa
Therapy Association in aid of the treat-
ment centre in Macquarie-street. Besides
industrial cases of almost every nature,
the Centre’s field work includes treatment
for children and for the mentally retarded.
The Totally and Permanently Disabled
Soldiers’ Association will benefit from the
sales of the Carry On cookery book.
This book was compiled by Mrs. A.
King, of Alstonville, New South Wales.
During the first war 22,000 copies sold,
and the whole of the proceeds were
handed to various patriotic organisations.
The book has now been revised by Mrs.
King and brought up to date. Mrs.
King has given the copyright to the
Totally' and Permanently Disabled
Soldiers’ Association.

On August 11 the Full Bench of the
High Court declared vital sections of the
Federal Government’s Banking Act, 1947,
invalid —they were Sections 17 to 20 in-
clusive and 24 (8), all six Justices; 14 (2),
23 and 24, five Justices; 13 to 16 and 37
to 46, four Justices; 12 and 47 to 56,
three Justices. Two days later Prime
Minister and Treasurer Chifley, after con-
sulting all members of the Cabinet, said
“a decision has been reached to seek an
appeal to the Privy Council at the earliest
possible date.” And there the matter
stands for the present.
Meanwhile the Government is pre-
vented from nationalising the private
trading banks through the back-door in-
strumentality of the Act by a Court order
restraining the Federal Treasurer and
Commonwealth Bank, or anybody acting
for them, from attempting to do so. And
the defendant Government has been
ordered to pay full costs of the High
Court action, which occupied an array
of legal talent for 39 days and is ex-
pected to run into £75,000 or thereabouts.
Though concerned with legal issues
alone, the High Court judgment involves
far more than the fate of the trading
banks. Its economic and social conse-
quences amount, briefly, to the difference
between democratic capitalism, with de-
centralised, automatic consumer control,
and socialistic capitalism, with highly
centralised State direction and bureau-
cratic control. At tlje recent Federal
referendum on prices-and-rent control
the people decided in no uncertain manner
which kind of capitalism, or economic
system, they preferred. The attempt to
reassemble the now ramshackle machinery
of the 1947 Act by appeal to the Privy
Council is indicative of the Treasurer’s
inveterate stubbornness and blindness to
public and legal remonstrance.
Without the 1947 Act the future of the
trading banks still rests more on the policy
of the Federal Treasurer than in the
hands of their directors. The Federal
Banking Act, 1945, still in force, provides
for official regulation of the purpose and
amount of their advances (normally their
chief earning asset), the rate of interest
they can charge for loans and pay on
deposits, the volume of their investment
in Government and other securities, and
the proportion of deposits they must
lodge on special account with the Com-
monwealth Bank, now the agent for
policing Government economic policy on
the money side. No limit is placed on
dividends by the Act, but its machinery
provides for effective control of profits.
Section 48 of the 1945 Act, directing
Government and local-government bodies
to bank with the Commoiiwealth Bank,
was challenged and held by the High
Court to be invalid. Many doubt the
validity of some other sections of this
Act, which might yet be challenged in
the Court.
The banks are able and anxious to play
their part in further development of Aus-
tralia, and never were they better equipped
for the purpose. Their forward-looking
and co-operative attitude is evidenced by
the expressed hope of their associated
chairman, L. J. McConnan, that “those en-
trusted with heavy banking responsibilities
will be free, in co-operation with the
central bank, to devote their energies
to the development of an even wider and
better banking service,” Here are
C.B.A.’s balance-sheet figures:

Last term’s growth of £10,513,334 in de-
posits—a reflection of inflationary pressure
resulting from high export income and
lively home trade, supported by scarcities
and rising wage-rates—was accompanied
by an expansion of £6,750,619 in ad-
vances and addition of £3,754,084 to
low-interest-bearing liquids. The last-
mentioned include Australian Treasury
bills (£3,500,000), Federal Government
securities (£1,633,059) and special
account with the Commonwealth Bank
(£31,548,000), total £36,681,059, or
only £4,292,483 less than the amount
advanced to traders and others.
The £300,798 (up £17,625) of profit
covered the pref. div, (£84,694) and
10.8 p.c, on ord. capital as against 9.9 p.c.
for the preceding term. On shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves combined) the
year’s profit was only 4.6 p.c. The div,
was lifted from a nominal 8 p.c. to 9 p.c.
—nominal because it is worth only half
that rate on all but a small fraction of
the ord. capital, which was gathered at
a premium of 100 p.c.
The £4,117,350 of capital is in 211,735
£lO 4 p.c. prefs, cumulative to 3 p.c. and
4.000. 10s. ords. The market for the
scrip has remained fairly steady around
235. ords. and £ll prefs., giving a return
of 4.1 p.c. and 3.6 p.c. respectively on
the basis of last term’s distributions.

The lift in the div. surprised the market.
After a five-year run of 10 p.c. distribu-
tions to end May, 1941, the rate dropped
to 1\ p.c., and remained steady until the
close of last accounts, when a p.c.
bonus lifted the figure to 10 p.c. again.
The drop followed a contraction in earn-
ings owing to difficulties associated with
supplies of linseed and rising costs, both
of which still persist.
Paid capital is £367,369 in £1 shares,
of which 10,000 are first and a like
number second prefs., both 10 p.c. cumu-
lative, and 369,182 ords., of which
313,413 are fully paid and the balance
paid to ss. each. The prefs. are subject
to the N.S.W. Interest Reduction Act.
After sales at 355. a month or so ago,
sellers last week asked 455., cum. div. and
bonus (= Is. a share), for the f.-p. ords.
For the first prefs. 475. is asked after
month-old sales af 375. On a 7f p.c. div,
basis the ords. at 355. and the prefs. at
375. returned 4,4 p.c. and 4.2 p.c. respec-
tively. On a 10 p.c, distribution the ords.
at 445. (net) and the prefs. at 465. (net)
yield 4.5 p.c. and 4.3 p.c. respectively.
The second prefs. seldom appear on the
market. Net tangible cover is £lB Is. 6d.
firsts, £l7 Is. 6d. seconds and 19s. Bd.
ords. ;
The question is whether the 10 p.c. is
likely to be maintained. There is no
certainty about it; the business is subject
to a very wide range of influences, and the
price-cost structure is far from being on
a firm basis at the moment. Hence the
“bonus” label on 2\ p.c. of the year s
distribution. The improvement of £6661
in the year’s net earnings appears to have
come mainly from savings in allowances
for depreciation (£15,632, down £4462)
and taxation (amount unspecified) follow-
ing abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax. The
£40,769 of profit covered the full contract
rate to the prefs. (£4000) and 11.2 p.c. on
ord, capital as against 9.1, 9, 8.4, 8.3, 8.2,
7.9, 10.9 and 11.2 p.c. back to 1940.
Owing to wholly inadequate supplies
of linseed, the co.’s three mills —one each
at Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide —
again did little in the way of manufacture.
Activities centred mainly on processing
and packing of imported linseed oil, con-
siderable quantities of which came from
India and North and South America.
Hence the smaller allowance for deprecia-
tion, which is likely to be increased again
when plant gets a full meal. When that
will be is difficult to say. The Federal
Government has just arranged for more
linseed and linseed oil from India in ex-
change for wheat, but the quantity of seed
is “entirely inadequate in relation to full
employment of our plant,” the chairman
says.
In a commendable effort to make Aus-
tralia independent of foreign seed, the co.
is co-operating with public agricultural
authorities and the Flax Growers Associa-
tion —enough seed was grown last season
to sow about 20,000 acres during the
coming one. Reasonable provision
(amount unstated) has been made to meet
hazards associated with this venture —
plant disease, insect pests and fluctuations
in world supply of linseed.
Substantial quantities of oil were re-
ceived before the close of accounts:

Shareholders—most of them are also
clients —have fared much better than the
figures in the table suggest. Consignors
received rebates on selling charges total-
ling £52,968 (up £19,211) last term. That
was equal to 13.9 p.c. on capital, and
made total rebates to date £445,351.
Taken in conjunction with the div., which
was lifted from 5 p.c. to 6 p.c, and called
for all but £1420 of the increased profit
claimed, , the year’s result was an extra-
ordinarily good one.
Seasonal conditions were fair to good
over most of the southern half of the
State. In the northern half they were
patchy to bad, and serious losses of live-
stock have occurred. Lack of transport,
water and agistment has aggravated the
position. Still, there was a leap of 38.5
p.c. in turnover, thanks largely to record
prices for wool and livestock. The co.,
which handles more wool and livestock
than any other broker operating in the
Northern State, received an extra 1274
bales wool and put under the hammer
an additional 59,496 cattle and 295,686
sheep and lambs;

Australia’s wool cheque last season was
a record £155-odd million (up £63-odd
million), the overall average being 39.97 d.
a pound, or 59 p.c. above the previous
year’s average and three times the average
for the five years to end June, 1939.
As for the current term, good winter
rains have again brightened the outlook
for pastoralists south of the tropic. North
of Capricorn dry conditions continue,
practically no agistment is available, the
water problem is adding to the number of
stock-routes unusable, transport is dear
and scarce, and the dingo, blowfly and
Noogoora burr are other troubles. No
immediate and sharp recession in wool
prices is anticipated. The Australian
minimum reserve average price for the
coming clip has been fixed at approxi-
mately 23id. a pound, up 20 p.c. on last
season’s figure.. To most Queensland
growers this means about 27d. a pound,
or £36 a bale, owing to the large percent-
age of Merino grown in that State. Apart
from seasonal influences, chief worries at
the moment are high and rising costs
and scarcity of labor, transport and
supplies. Current season’s auctions open
in Sydney on August 31, and in Brisbane
on September 13..
Balance-sheet figures mainly reflect the
effects of high prices:

A couple of years ago it looked as if
rising costs might endanger the 10 p.c.
div., which has been an annual event for
the last 27 years. But so far earnings
have won the race, thanks to the swelling
volume of business placed in the expert
care of the co., which, has grown up
under the protective wing of Elder Smith
and Co. Recent expansion has followed
the rapid growth of industrial and other
trade activity in South Aus., increase of
population, inflation, and the complica-
tions and uncertainties which a “man-
aged” economy, with its maze of taxation
and legislative controls, has brought
about.
Trusts, etc., that came under the co.’s
administration last term amounted to
£2,150,915 (up £771,254). That exceeded
the value of similar businesses wound up
by £890,358:

all but £478, leaving the net result

to 1943. After paying the div.,
writing £1056 off premises, etc.,
and sending £l7OO to the staff
fund, £1092 was put on the
shelf, lifting reserves to £84,379.
So capital and reserves com-
bined need turn in only 5.2 p.c,
to cover 10 p.c. on the £90,000
of capital alone.
Obviously there isn’t much
profit in the trustee section of
the business these days. The
problem is to keep exes, from
advancing at a faster fate than
earnings. Last term exes', took
an extra 325. p.c. of this co.’s
gross earnings, making the
growth £8 10s. p.c. since 1939,
However, there is nothing at the
moment to suggest that the 10
p.c. div. is likely to be interfered
with, and, apart from investment
of their own funds, these trustee
cos. don’t have to risk much.
At end March last the co.’s
capital and reserves, together
with £2119 coming to outsiders,
were represented by freehold,
etc., £63,400, book debts £5945,
and Government securities,
cash, etc., £113,352.
Taking the long view, the
market prices the pound shares'
paid to ss. each at 14s. 9d. At
that figure the return is 3.4 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The in-
vestor who looks for 4 p.c. on
his money counts on a 12 p.c.
distribution. Net tangible cover
is 9s. Bd. per share.
Gold Mines of Australia
This Melbourne-controlled ex-
ploration and finance co., of
whose £52,219 of paid capital
(2s. 6d. shares) Gold Explora-
tion and Finance holds 62 p.c.,
recorded a loss of £836 for the
year to end March - last —£1745 *
was written off on account of
unsuccessful investigations.
The co. is g.m, and consultant
of and holds shares (shown in
parenthesis) in the recently-
formed Central Victoria Gold
Dredging (71,485 10s. shares),
Morning Star (1200 4s. shares),
Mt. Coolon (800 10s. shares),
Triton (900 10s. shares) and Vic-
toria Gold Dredging (1200 £1
shares). Morning Star and Vic-
toria Gold Dredging paid Is. 6d.
and Is, a share respectively last
term. The last-mentioned co.’s
property is now worked out, and
the dredge has been sold to the
new Central Victoria co. for
125.000 f.-p. 10s. shares. In
August last those on G.M.A.’s
register were offered 157,250 of
the new Central co.’s shares,
one-for-four, at par. If prospec-
tus estimates are realised, the
Central co. should net enough to
return its present capital, plus
about 9 p.c, p.a. over a period
of 10 years, with prospects of
additional pay-dirt being dis-
closed.
Interest now centres mainly in
the Stawell (Vic.) and Miclere
(C.Q.) areas, which are being
prospected. At Stawell drills are
searching for new ore-shoots
northward along the pitch of an
anticlinal structure. A lot of
pay-ore and some untested pros-
pects exist in the vicinity of old
workings. If enough additional
ore is indicated, the next step
will be to unwater the mines and
begin underground develop-
ment.
At Miclere drilling has dis-
closed extensive gold-bearing
wash, and a prospecting shaft is
being sunk near the centre of
the main load, where values will
be tested by driving and cross-
cutting. The shaft, now down
114 ft., is to go to 364 ft.
At Sandy Creek, Newstead
(Vic.), the lead, deep and rather
clayey, is too small to warrant
installation of a dredge. The
possibility of working the show
as a small, deep-lead mine is
under consideration.
Cuthbert’s Misima, Misima
Island (Papua), is offering those
on the register at end August
50.000 new 10s. shares, two for
13, at par, payable 6d. each ap-
plication and allotment, and the
balance as required in Is. calls.
The money is wanted to test-drill
the lode to 1000 ft., and so ascer-
tain whether the oxides persist
below present drainage level
(590 ft.) and the extent and
probable value of the sulphides.
There is already over 200,000
tons of proved and more than
103.000 tons of probable ore, ex-
pected to average over sdwt.
and carrying a lot of silver, in
sight in the southern sector. The
northern sector, not yet tested,
is also expected to prove a valu-
able asset.

j=
□ t
m a
s*

The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as' the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.
Whatever your steam requirements may be, and whatever fuel you
may use, you can rely upon Babcock & Wilcox Ltd. for advice,
which will be given without bias. As manufacturers of chain grate,
travelling grate, retort type and spreader stokers, also pulverised
fuel firing and oil firing equipment, in addition to furnaces designed
for hand firing and the firing of various fuels including blast
furnace gas, bagasse, sawmill refuse, spent tan, etc., etc., we are
in a position to give advice on the most suitable combustion
equipment for your own particular application.

well done.
It is recorded that when the
opera was produced in Paris
the orchestra and chorus
showed a distinct disinclina-
tion to follow the composer’s
minute directions, and he
put on his hat and left the
theatre. It is doubtful if he
would have done that in Mel-
bourne. The orchestra of 50,
headed by that fine violinist De
Tarczynski, the soloists and the
Egyptian priesthood paid the
highest respect to Verdi’s music.
In fact, the mysteries of the
Temple of Vulcan, the whisper-
ing waves of Father Nile and the
ferocious trial of Rhadames were
painted by them in much more
convincing forms and colors than
the stage architects and scene-
painters brought to the visual
aspect.
Rhadames, in the small dark
person of Argentinian tenor
Lagares, in high-heeled shoes and
a diffident style of acting, looked
anything but martial, but he was
vocally impressive, particularly
in the duet “Fuggiam gli ardori.”
Germana di Guilio, possessed
of a commanding figure and a
voluptuous soprano, made Aida
what she should be —the proud
princess of a barbarous king-
dom only temporarily a slave
girl—and Mario Basiola as her
father gave the savage Amo-
nasro a rich voice and an emo-
tional force which made Aida’s
betrayal of her lover a plausible
proceeding.
As the jilted Egyptian prin-
cess, Dora Minarchi combined
the conventions of Italian opera"
with a contralto of singular
sweetness, and King Plinio Clab-
assi was a suitably majestic
Pharaoh. Augusto Romani was
the incarnation of ecclesiastical
hate as high priest Rhamphis,
though he lacked the vocal pomp
and tonnage of Melbourne’s
Frederick Collier, whom Nature
made for that part.
The triumphal return of
Rhadames to Thebes, in which
Verdi combined spectacle with
emotion in overwhelming mea-
sure, has been done better —pos-
sibly it was the 40-hour-week
and the recent rise in the basic
wage which thinned the ranks
of the Egyptian army and re-
duced the Theban civilian popu-
lation to the dimensions of a by-
election meeting in East Yarra.
Klecki's Beethoven.
Were the shade of Ludwig
van Beethoven tuned in to
A.B.C.’s wavelength on a night
last week he would surely have
approved the rugged strength
with which Paul Klecki, the
visiting Pole, piloted the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra through
his favorite brain-child, the
Third Symphony (“The
Eroica”).
Of all symphonies this is the
one cast in truly heroic mould.
The two crashing major chords
in full orchestra which open the
work proclaim the mood, and
this Klecki faithfully kept in
mind. His eye swept from
strings to tympani, from wood-
wind to brass; he frowned
fiercely as the elemental power
6f Beethoven’s tribute to a hero
swirled and eddied ; he smiled
gently at a phase of especially
good playing by the upper
strings: in the exposition, and he
maintained an unheard but cer-
tainly well-mouthed running
commentary to himself through-
out the work.
Grandeur was achieved in the
Funeral March, the great chords
broad and deep. Klecki literally
danced on the podium to the
fast triple rhythm of the
Scherzo, and here the orchestra
was at its top, with the piping
voice of the oboe clear and mel-
low. The conductor, perspiring
profusely though the night was
cold, carried the orchestra along
with tremendous energy in the
Presto, which rushes the sym-
phony to its epic conclusion. A
really fine performance.
Elsewhere the orchestra
played Brahms’s Variations on a
Theme by Haydn—playing that
was ffuent and graceful and
sensuous —Berlioz’s brilliantly-
scored “Benvenuto Ceflini”
Overture, and a Hymnus by the
Swiss composer Burkhard, an
uneven work in which the noc-
turne is more acceptable than
the day piece (Praeludium)
which comprises the uninterest-
ing first half.
N.S.W. Junior
Orchestra and Choir.
Prof. Carl Sauer’s confidence
that Schubert’s Symphony in B
Minor (“The Unfinished”) would
not be beyond the compass of
his Junior Orchestra was justi-
fied, at Sydney Town Hall,
by a performance which, ex-
cept for some uncertainty at
the statement of the first theme
in the first movement, was
highly creditable for such young
musicians. From the moment
that the horns and bassoons sus-
tain the unison D which leads
to the second theme the playing
was crisp.
The March from Meyerbeer’s
“Prophet” and Rossini’s Tan-
credi Overture —which required
more weight in strings and
woodwind—found the orchestra
in good fettle, although still
better co-ordination in attack by
all four sections is needed.
The choir dropped with vocal
ease from the spirited heights of
Beethoven’s “Creation’s Hymn”
to the gentle lilt of Mozart’s
“Cradle Song.” Shirley Bushell
used with neat judgment a voice
ranging from mezzo-soprano to
contralto in Handel’s “He Shall
Feed His Flock” and the
“Seguidilla” from “Carmen.”
Thirteen-year-old violinist
Michael Adler played Beeth-
oven’s “Romance” with con-
siderable promise and poise.
"Ah, Wilderness!"
Sydney Minerva’s current
offering is “Ah, Wilderness!”
Eugene O’Neill’s slightly sad and
sentimental sigh over the prob-
lems of adolescence. The pro-
duction, by Fifi Banvard, is ex-
cellent—the best seen at the
Minerva for months and
should more than satisfy those
who like to indulge in or listen
to a slightly sad and sentimental
sigh over the problems of ado-
lescence.
O’Neill’s adolescent is a young
fellow of 17 whose girl-friend is
ordered to drop him because he
regales her with too much
Swinburne. His reaction is to
spend an uncomfortable evening
with a prostitute in the back
parlor of a shady pub, to re-
turn home sozzled to the wide
and to awake next morning sick
and sorry with a hangover. His
girl-friend defies parental disci-
pline, and they are reconciled
after an innocent and senti-
mental half-hour on the beach,
while his wonderfully under-
standing parents ease him
through the crisis by doing little
more than nothing about it.
An utterly sentimental and
distorted view of youth, of
course, so it says much for Miss
Banvard’s production that she
makes it the smoothest and
most animated production of all
the Minerva’s recent plays.
Trader Faulkner draws the
troubled youth with broad, ob-
vious and occasionally overen-
thusiastic lines. Lou Vernon and
Bebe Scott linger sentimentally
over the incredibly sentimental
mother and father, and, in less
cloying roles, Edward Howell
and Therese Desmond provide
a touch of typical O’Neill
melancholy as the couple who
cannot get married , because he
is always getting drunk because
she won’t marry him because he
is always getting drunk.
Leonard Long
Paintings.
The best of the Leonard Long
oils on view at the Grosvenor
Galleries, 219 George-street,
Sydney, are the smaller paint-
ings where the artist has ob-
served some aspect of the
countryside—a tree, a hill or a
passing cloud—and has been
content to present it not too
ambitiously. There is quiet
charm in “The Gum,” the tree
made a symbol of shelter and
admirably painted as well, a
sheep resting under it and cool
shadows blending with the green
earth, “By the Stream,” “The
Road to Barrengarry,” “Wet
Day” and “Storm” —a torn piece
of sky over a hill with two trees
—are other examples of the
artist’s talent for pleasant, small
paintings. Some of his gold-
touched trees and green pastures
are similarly admirable.
If not exactly lacking in light,
however, many of Long’s land-
scapes lack that dramatisation
of light which is necessary in the
best painting of Australian
landscape. There are burnt,
brownish fields, but they have
not the burnt-gold effect of dried
grasses under strong sunlight.
They are more like carefully-
painted pictures browned by
time. Long is happiest with the
greens and shadows, although,
with a few fine exceptions, the
shadows are a little too domin-
ant.
“Sunset, Shoalhaven River” is
a large painting in a low key
and with poetic content. But
the large “Currawong Cliffs”
follows Nature too rigidly,
battlements of worn rock having
the regular appearance of neatly-
stacked logs of wood.

William Hyde Wollaston. To the scientist of
to-day, a laboratory without platinum apparatus
would be unthinkable. Yet for a hundred years
after its discovery this valuable metal remained
unused because it could not be worked. It was an
English doctor, William Hyde Wollaston who dis-
covered that spongy platinum becomes malleable
when strongly compressed. By using this process
he was able to manufacture platinum apparatus,
and was the first to do so on a commercial scale.
One of a family of fourteen, Wollaston was born
in 1766, He read medicine at the University of
Cambridge and practised for a time, but retired
from the profession in 1800 to devote his energies
to chemical research.
As well as developing his method of working
platinum commercially, he did a great deal of
purely academic research and discovered two new
metals. The first was called palladium and the
second rhodium because of the rose pink colour of
many of its compounds. He also investigated the
production of electricity by chemical means, and
carried out many experiments in optics. Among
his inventions was that of the cryophorus —an
instrument for showing how the temperature of
water falls as it evaporates. Wollaston had un-
usually keen vision and steady hands, being able
to write on glass with a diamond in a script so
small that normal people could only read the
characters through a microscope. He enjoyed a
considerable reputation among his contemporaries
for the accuracy of his work and his resourceful-
ness as a practical scientist. He died
in 1828. Every piece of platinum
apparatus in the laboratories of the
world is a monument to the work
of this British scientist. S

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
An exhibition of faultless jumping
by the winner , and his surprising
freshness at the end of the gruelling
trip, excellent riding by his com-
paratively inexperienced rider S.
Henry, and an unusual number of
casualties were features of the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase at Caulfield on
Saturday.
The starter sent off a field of 18
runners, but only eight survived to the
finish. Favorite Bronze Laddie
was going along nicely to the satis-
faction of his backers until he muffed
the last fence in the straight on the
second time round; another well-
fancied one, The Feline, fell near the
seven-furlongs mark, but by that
time the race had clearly developed
into a battle between Jevington, who
was in front, Cheery Boy and Grey
Gull. Cheery Boy collared Jevington
just before the last jump, sailed over
comfortably and sprinted away to a
five-lengths win. Grey Gull was
third, four lengths behind Jevington,
with Parentena, Nantilla, Wangaratta,
Query and Tente, in that order, the
only others to complete the course.
Cheery Boy, who started at 16 to
1, is an aged bay gelding by Cim-
brian-Lady Burnewang, and is owned
by L. A. Sullivan in partnership with
his trainer, F. Pedrana. R. Watts
was to have ridden Cheery Boy, but
a fall from Fairy Fabfle in the Arkar-
inga Hurdle put him out of action
and gave S. Henry, having only his
11th ride over the jumps, a lucky
last-minute engagement.
The Hurdle was rather more satis-
factory for punters, with 7-to-4
favorite Gallant Gentleman (L.
Meenan) doing the right thing,
though, by the same token, it was
a Iqcky win. The rank outsider
Dramarda was left in front when
Fairy Fable came down at the second-
last fence, but bungled the final jump
himself and allowed the favorite to
get up. An interesting runner in the
Hurdle was that fairish performer on
the flat, Immediate. Connections must
have decided that they might just as
well run him in jumping events since
he was, in any case, getting steeple-
chase weights on the flat.
Jockey T. Unkovich had a field
day at Caulfield, winning three of
the six flat-races. First leg of his
treble was Carbon Copy, downing
Derrymore and favorite Ellerslie in
the second Chatsworth Plate for
three-year-old colts and geldings. A
Snut colt by Heltos-Havers,
Carbon Copy produced abashing
run from the tail of the field to win
a photo.-finish in which the margin
were a half-head and a head. He
is likely, now, to have a run in the
AJ C Derby. The first division of
the Chatsworth went to topweight
and favorite Phoibos (A. Breasley)
with Clement and Bon Dhoti in the
places.
E. A. Underwood certainly has
two fine sires in Helios and Dhoti
at his Warlaby Stud. They were
represented at Caulfield by four win-
ners and three minor-placegetters in
the six flat-races. Phoibos, as well
as Carbon Copy and Derrymore, is
by Helios. Nilam (J. Purtell), who
defeated Saxony and New England
in the Cambria Plate for four-year-
olds, is by Dhoti, as is Nawab (1.
Unkovich), who won the 12-furlongs
Malakoff Stakes from Dashing Beau
and Gayness. Bon Dhoti and Vice-
roy, both also by Dhoti, bagged
minor placings.
Unkovich completed his riding
treble with the 25-to-l chance
Hororata scoring from Allied Power
and Viceroy in the second St. Aubin
Handicap. The first division of the
same race saw a first-up betting
plunge go west on Fresh Boy ; in
need of the run, Fresh Boy finished
a close third behind Noble Prince
and Grand Gift.
« ♦ * *
It was reported in a Sydney morn-
ing paper on Saturday that “Punters
seeking to gain an advantage in tight
markets on today’s races at Moore-
field yesterday offered to accept less
than 20 to 1 about picking four
winners. Bookmakers would not be
tempted into betting.” It would be
rather a fine point to decide which
were the greater fools, but perhaps
the bookies deserve a close decision.
Of the four good things, so-called,
each starting at odds-on, one was
successful. And Moorefield was once
known as the Punters’ Paradise!
The rot set in with Danger starting
at 10 to 9 on for the mile Three-
year-old Handicap and finishing fifth;
he had been coming along nicely as
they turned for home, but found either
topweight of 9,4 or the downhill
finish not to his taste and faded out.
In a rattling good finish, the 10-to-l
chance My Request (W. Briscoe),
gaining a beautiful run along the
rails, beat Duke of Syke by a half-
%head with High Spirits only a half-
head further back third.
Subsequent chapters in the sad tale
were the defeats of Darling (11 to 8
on) by Darelle (N. Sellwood) in the
second Brighton Mixed Stakes (6f.)
and of Chief Mohican (2 to 1 on)
by High Ideals (R. Pearse) in the
mile Kogarah Mixed Stakes. High
Ideals was won by his present owner
as first prize in a bob raffle; rightly,
on previous form, he started at 100
to 1. Punters who had either cash
or courage left after those results
and after Irish Lass (R. Mclntosh)
at 33 to 1 had won the first Brighton
Mixed were able to save a little
from the wreckage when Binnaway
(N. Sellwood), at 10 to 9 on, did
win the Rockdale Mixed Stakes
(lOf .)•
The main double of Flying and
Moorefield Handicaps brought further
grief and pain to the majority of
“Tell the missus not to cook that beefsteak."
punters. Belle Cherie, hard-ridden
by Briscoe to win the Flying by a
half-neck from Yankee Lad and
Double Gift, started fourth favorite
in a field of nine. The chances of
Yankee Lad and favorite Rose Glory
were affected when Kindly Light,
tiring suddenly, dropped back and
caused crowding which attracted the
attention of the stewards.
The same number, nine, started in
the Moorefield Handicap, with Rifle
(J. Browne) alsd fourth in the betting.
After being well back earlier in the
race, Rifle had moved up to a handy
third at the turn and, despite being
carried wide, finished too strongly for
Buonarroti Boy and Golden Plumes.
A son of the Victoria Derby-winner
Hua, Rifle has good staying blood,
and with featherweights to carry
might worry some of the opposition
in the Spring distance races.
As consistent as they make them,
with five wins and 10 minor placings
to his credit from 20 starts, the-
Talking gelding Hava Chat (E.
Fordyce) provided punters with their
fares home, when, as 6-to-4 favorite,
he won the Welter, a feature of
which was the heavy backing of
Flying Duke, having his first run after
a lengthy spell; lumping 9.12, he
fairly flew home to tfe second a
length behind the winner.

The Games;
With Merv Woods taking the scull-
ing title, Australia wound up the best
year it has ever had at Olympic
games. One wonders now if the appro-
priate Australian sporting authorities
have learned any lesson this time;
if they have asked themselves why
several of those minor placings were
not wins—margins of failure in many
cases were a matter of bare inches.
The answer, of course, is thorough,
intensive, skilled training, beginning
not three years hence but now. And
with it the adoption of Olympic
standards —cinder running-tracks in-
stead of turf, and recognised pietric
distances instead of the hotchpotch
of odd distances used for most run-
ning, swimming and rowing events in
Australia.
* * * *
The Cricketers:
For the commencement of the fifth
Test on Saturday the ground was
absolutely waterlogged, but with
blankets and sawdust groundsmen
had it playable after only half an
hour’s delay. Winning the toss,
Yardley rightly anticipated a dead,
easy wicket, and chose to bat. Fol-
lowed then one of those inexplicable
things which make the game what it
is—England all out for 52. Of the
52, Hutton contributed 30, Yardley 7
and “sundries” was the third-highest
scorer with 6. The pitch was not
difficult; but Lindwall bowled mag-
nificently, and a couple of heart-
breakingly brilliant catches must have
lowered the English morale. Lindwall
took six for 20, Miller two for five
and Johnston two for 20 in the 42
overs sent down.
After the heavy roller had done a
little to harden-up the pitch, Morns
and Barnes opened and Barnes set
the tempo by scoring off the first
ball received; both then proceeded
individually to eclipse England’s
total. Barnes went at 61, bowled
Hollies, who further retrieved his
side’s honor by getting Bradman for
a duck in the same over. At stumps
on the first day Australia had 153 on
the board for two wickets, with
Morris 77 and Hassett 10.
* * * *
High winds and low scores spoilt
the V.F.L. games on Saturday for
the 80,000 who looked on, most of
them divided between the l< mg
matches at Richmond and Carlton. -
The Tigers were at home to Essendon,
were blown off their course, got back
when the Dons were blown off theirs
but missed by three points, 8.10-8.7.
Carlton went in under close-reeled
canvas, got to windward of Wood
and prevailed with small shot,
10.10. At South /Melbourne the
locals and St. Kildd barely escaped
being blown out into Port Phillip,
and when rescue came “Sowth” had
5.11 to 5.9. The joy at Glenferne
when Hawthorn downed Fitzroy, 6.7-
4.16, was equalled on the Man-
byrnong when a courier from Gee-
long brought the Footscray-Geelong
result, 11.25-7.15, for Footscray.
Melbourne leisurely kicked 10.14 to
North’s 5.12. It’s Essendon, Collmg-
wood, Melbourne and Richmond,
with Fitzroy, ’Scray and Carlton hav-
ing a bare chance.

Rugby Union: Manly beat St.
George 17-12, Wallaby winger Charlie
Bastes scoring the decisive try, with a
fine 75-yards run. Windon, of Rand-
wick, was also in a try-getting mood,
scoring four for his team against East-
wood. Randwick won, 29-9. Easts beat
Drummoyne 23-5, backs Tate, Mor-
combe and Webb taking the eye, and
Gordon, ably skippered by Trevor
Allan, beat Parramatta 23-12. Urn-
. versify and Wests finished level, 22-
22, after University had been down
6-22.
* * * *
While the progress of a Rugby
League team, en route for England,
and doing nothing of note other than
suffering severe mal de mer, has had
detailed description in the daily press,
there’s been scarcely a word of the
Australian Soccer tourers at present
playing in New Zealand. At Wel-
lington on Saturday they licked New
Zealand 6-0, with Parsons booting
three goals, Hughes two and Cun-
ningham the other.
* * * *
In his match with A 1 Lewis (9.2)
at Leichhardt, State fedder champion
Ted Sprouster (9.2 i) again de-
monstrated his bad habit of loafing
through the early rounds. Inches
taller, and longer in reach, Lewis
scored freely until Sprouster settled
down to serious business in the sixth
round. From there on Sprouster
overwhelmed the opposition for a
clear points decision. He’s a good
little fighter and would be a much
better one if only he would fight all
the way.

Future Share Prices
The Australian sharemarkets,
on the whole, have steadied since
the setback in February this
year ; there has been recovery to
not much below the highest post-
war prices for some stocks, but
the market is no longer advanc-
ing in any regular order. Specu-
lative keenness has been dulled,
though any improvement in div.-
paying among the various list-
ings is readily recognised by
market revaluation.
The tendency now is to believe
in investment benefits when they
can be seen. Support for shares
in Bitumen and Oil Refineries, a
new enterprise, has fallen a good
deal since early in the year ; the
refinery is now going through its
teething troubles, and the shares
have fallen from around 38s. to
near 295. Felt and Textile
ords. have dropped from a
“high” of 68s, to 615., whereas
Broken Hill Prop, has recovered
most of the market ground lost
earlier in the year; but several
other market leaders are still
considerably weaker than they
were in January this year, when
prices were at their post-war
peak. The market is expecting
a much bigger div. from
Masonite as a result of the
duplication of its plant, and is
paying 555. for the scrip, com-
pared with 495. 6d. at the
January peak, and as low as 465.
later.
What are the basic prin-
ciples on which industrial ordi-
nary shares should be valued at
the present time?
The inflationary factor re-
mains one of special importance.
Costs and prices continue to
rise, and it is unlikely that we
have seen the end of the effects
of Canberra budgetary inflation,
trade-union wage-costs inflation,
industrial-disruption-costs infla-
tion, or the inflation in prices of
many imported raw materials or
manufactured goods. (In the
United States the cost of motor
vehicles, for instance, is still
rising.)
Rising costs mean a higher ex-
penditure for plant-replacement
or factory expansion—noticeable
in the capitalisation at a million
pounds of a new co. to turn out
100,000 tons of cement a year in
Maoriland and a similar ultimate
capital outlay by a Sydney co.
which aims to produce 150,000
tons a year with a secondhand
plant. By comparison, Standard
Cement, a pre-war concern, has
a 100,000-ton plant and a share-
capital of only £399,405. Kan-
dos, with a plant-capacity of
about 200,000 tons behind it, has
a capital of £673,862. It would
appear that the cost of establish-
ment in the cement industry has
risen by at least 50 p.c. since war
began—possibly more. The older
concerns have the help of re-
serves in financing plant-pur-
chase and maintenance.
This inflation in industrial-
establishment charges cannot be
ignored in putting a present
vaiue on industrial shares. Con-
cerns with effective plant valued
at a low, written-down figure
are in a strong position com-
pared with newcomers; and if
profit-margins are to be based
in future on the capitalisation
of new plant that is not demon-
strated to be more efficient than
the old, then the older companies
should show especially good
profits on their capital. No
plant, of course, is worth more
than it can be made to earn.
Certain inflationary aspects
are a dead loss to all industry.
Reduced output per man-hour
and soaring production costs,
coupled with high taxation, are
producing industrial paralysis.
Industries, regardless of their
capitalisation, are not able to
operate fully and effectively, and
it is unlikely that shareholders in
industrial stocks will see pros-
pects of reaping the full benefit
of the financial and industrial
strength of 'their investments
until the community is working
in full harmony for a higher
standard of living by all. Only
when the attitude of the people
as a whole is “a fair day’s work
for fair pay” will there cease
to be that continued inflation in
costs and prices that is reducing
the standard of living, depreciat-
ing the value of money savings
and making a fiction of divi-
dends that have remained
“steady” since 1939.
There is nothing that is good
about inflation. Even the “rise”
in share prices seen since 1939,
where it no more than keeps
pace with inflation in other
prices—that is, the depreciation
in the value of paper money—
“Hold it, chief —you haven't signed the wages cheque!"
does no more than protect the
investor’s original capital. Many
people, however, are happy to
have achieved no more than
capital-protection through their
early investment in industrial
ordinary shares.
It is possible that the years
1948 and 1949 will see the end
of an irresponsible, Communist-
fostered onslaught against pro-
duction and efficiency in this
country. A showdown draws
nearer daily. Parliamentary
“Labor” parties are out of favor
with the community and Com-
munists are becoming a hated
intrusion into our life. The 40-
hour week is being' .revealed as
a luxury that can be afforded
only if 40 hours are worked each
week. And the whole nation’s
attention is being directed to-
wards the wicked restriction of
production in the coal industry.
If self-government is to remain
the privilege and responsibility
of Australians, then the coal-
fields must be restored to full
sanity and productivity. That
may follow a defeat of Federal
“Labor” in 1949, if not before.
Australian investors are con-
cerned about the stability or
otherwise of our export prices.
A good deal of allowance ap-
pears to have been made in share
prices for a possible fall. Even
if landmen suffer a drop in in-
comes later on, a reduction in
taxes and a better labor and sup-
plies position would probably
more than compensate. There is
a great volume of unspent money
in the Commonwealth, and, pro-
vided the right kind of goods
were available at a reasonable
price, industry would have orders
to fill for years yet even if ex-
port prices did shrink a* bit.
If inflationary conditions cease
through better budgeting, greater
production and a more economic
use of manpower, then a greater
volume of goods passing through
the nation’s industries, coupled
with stable costs, should more
than compensate for any fall in
prices and, with price-control no
longer necessary, efficient indus-
tries should show greater profits
than today, and their dividends
should possess a greater buying-
power.
Interest rates may rise a little
from their present low levels.
That would tend to bring down
share prices only where the rise
was above what is a really com-
petitive rate of interest at the
present time. Bank-deposit and
Consols rates do not attract in-
vestors very strongly now,
Australian industry is not
functioning at anything like
capacity today because of coal
stoppages, wharf stoppages, slow
turn-round of ships, the abuse
of the 40-hour week, the Gov-
ernment misuse and misdirec-
tion of labor, and heavy taxa-
tion. The straightening-out of
these problems rests primarily
with the defeat of Socialism,
which has been dealt a hard
blow by the recent referendum
vote and the verdict in the Bank
Case. When they are at last
straightened-out the scope and
profit-earning capacity of effi-
cient industry will be greatly
widened, and the progress of this
country should be noticeably
accelerated. The key to general
prosperity rests in greater pro-
duction of a desired nature.
When full, competitive pro-
duction is again with us we will
find ourselves in an era of
higher-than-pre-war, even if
stable, costs and prices, includ-
ing equity prices. In the greater
production, hard work, thrift and
enterprise will have to receive
those rewards which are neces-
sary to incentive if our plans for
higher living standards all round
and*>a greater measure of social
security are to become a sub-
stantial fact.
Cement in N. S. Wales
Addressing the co.’s share-
holders, the chairman of Kandos
Cement commented, with regard
to the proposed activities of a
new N. S. Wales cement co.
(Metropolitan Portland Cement,
Ltd.):— 3
There are already five companies
manufacturing cement in this State.
Their combined production capacity
is 670,000 otons p.a., an estimate which
includes the output of the Standard
Co., whose plant was closed down
during the war period but which will
restart during the next few months.
The capacity of the new co.’s plant
is stated at 150,000 tons p.a., which
will bring the total output capacity
of N.S.W. cement plants to 820,000
tons a year....
You will be concerned to know
whether we and other companies with
inland plants could successfully com-
pete with a new plant located so near
to Sydney. In our opinion we have
nothing to fear in this regard, pro-
vided the existing rail freight-rates
are not amended so as to give this
new co. an unfair advantage.
This qualification is made because
it would appear that negotiations for
a freight concession have for some
time been proceeding between pro-
moters of the new company and the
N.S.W. Government. Let me quote
from the co.’s prospectus on this
point:
On page 6, under the heading
“Unit Costs,” I quote: “The esti-
mates for transport charges are, of
course, bound up with arrangements
made for freight-rates.” On page
13, under the heading of “Valuation
of Limestone Deposits,” the following
statement appears: “Having regard
to the situation of the limestone to
your works site, near Liverpool, and
your total freight advantages oyer
other consumers, which I am in-
formed by your board approximate
£lOO,OOO per annum on your usage
of 250,000 tons of limestone per
year,” etc.
The position is being closely
watched, • but I cannot help feeling
that, having due regard to its profit-
fixing policy, the Government will
find it very difficult to justify an
arrangement involving the Railway
Department in a freight loss amount-
ing to £lOO,OOO a year
If the new company is charged the
existing railway freight-rates for its
raw materials we have no n.eed to
worry about price competition.
Further, I feel that if these rates are
altered the Government must make
corresponding concessions in regard
to transport of finished cement to
cofnpanies whose works are located
inland.
Mr. Raymond G. Hamilton,
“Labor” M.L.A. for Namoi and
a director of Metropolitan
Cement, might be able to make
a statement in the House as to
whether the new co. is, in fact,
going to receive an “unfair ad-
vantage” as regards freight-rates
on the Government railways.

CANBERRA AT SAVO ISLAND
By "MACNELL"
As with other Navies, the
R.A.N. was considerably affected
by two major factors between
both wars; the 1921 Washing-
ton treaty, limiting cruisers to
10,000 tons, and the depression
of the 1920’5, setting almost as
rigid restrictions through de-
mand for economy.
But four years later, faced
with the obsolescence of its
cruisers Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane —the Naval Board de-
cided to buy* two modem
cruisers from England. It was
influenced in its choice of
ships by inability at that time
to service battleships satisfac-
torily and by realisation that war
at sea knows no boundaries.
Eight-inch cruisers, with action
range of 10,500 miles, were
peculiarly suited to prevailing
requirements.
Canberra was a Kent-class
heavy cruiser, sister to Australia,
laid down by John Brown at
Clydebank in 1925. She was
launched on May 31, 1927, and
commissioned just over a year
later in Portsmouth by an Aus-
tralian crew.
Trials *
Acceptance trials during
which, before she is accepted
into naval service, a warship
flies the blue ensign—do their
best to tear a ship apart. Can-
berra’s long eight-inchers were
fired with full charges at ex-
treme elevation and depres-
sion, and varying elevations in
between. Then the four-inch
had their innings, also with full
charges, the deck-thrust, length
of recoil and pressure in recoil-
cylinders being carefully noted.
Cylinders were then packed to
reduce cubic area and the guns
fired again. Pressure inside was
tremendous—much more than
the gun would normally be re-
quired to bear. Depth-charges
were dropped from rails on her
stern, the explosions hammering
against her plates.
Engines were opened out to
full-speed ahead, then reversed
suddenly to full-speed astern.
The whole ship shuddered, her
sides streaming with boiling
froth. When steaming ahead
flat-out the wheel was put hard
over to starb’d ; then, while the
craft was heeling to the pressure
of rudder and thrusting screws,
the wheel was suddenly spun
hard -a - port. The cruiser
faltered, staggered, then came
upright.
To test anchors, cable and
holders her anchor was slipped
in deep water. Its heavy cable
jumped after it through the
hawsepipe with a din like trip-
hammers, The cable-holder was
braked hard. Fifty fathoms of
iron cable with a five-ton lump
of steel on its end heading for
the bottom were brought to an
abrupt standstill. It seemed the
fo’c’sle plates would tear out of
her, but she bowed her head,
shook it and ploughed steadily
on.
At last, “tested and found
correct,” Canberra returned to
base, in effect a unit of the
Navy. She arrived at Fremantle
via the Cape on January 29,
1929.
Followed the leisurely cruises
and regattas of the pre-war
peace, with 10 - days -a - year
gunnery, torpedo and seaman-
ship exercises with the rest of the
Squadron in Hervey Bay or
Jervis Bay. In October, 1934,
when the Duke of Gloucester
arrived in King’s cruiser Sussex,
Canberra acted as escort cruiser
on the Australian Station.
Late-1939 found her between
Cape York and Darwin, headed
for Bali and Singapore on a
tropical cruise. It was a hot
afternoon, sun glaring on a flat
seaj and the quartermaster at
the wheel could just make out
the bulk of an. island ahead,
black against the westering sun.
He was not surprised when
down the bridge voice-pipe
came: “Starb’d 20.” Over went
the wheel, and the big ship hesi-
tated, then swung at increasing
speed under her rudder.
She lifted clear of the island,
further, with still no order to
straighten her. In a few minutes
the ship had turned 180 degrees
and was nosing back past her
wake. Then the captain broad-
cast over the speakers that the
European situation had wor-
sened and the ship had been
ordered to speed back to
Sydney.
The Q.M., relaxed on the new
course, grinned at his helms-
man.
“Well, cobber, whatever the
old girl’s headed into, I’m the
bloke that turned her.”
Canberra had the Squadron
Navigating Officer as her pilot,
and at 22 knots she raced down
through the binding Barrier
Reef, a passage, to the best of
the writer’s knowledge, un-
equalled before, or since.
“Out Paravanes”
War found the ship in Sydney,
and her crew were emergency-
recalled. She slipped from Nq.
1 cruiser-buoy that night and
steamed to sea, men in high
spirits at the chance of action,
and half an hour after black
midnight commenced streaming
paravanes. Just before dawn the
torpedo-officer on the fo’c’sle,
weary and hoarse, reported
“P.Vs. running,” to the bridge.
High spirits had already fled.
Two years later, thoroughly
shaken-down in the Indian
Ocean, the captain could wait
with confidence until within 800
yards of harbor-mouth before
ordering paravanes in.
It has been told before that a
warship’s life is mainly un-
relieved monotony. Canberra,
steaming from New Zealand to
Fremantle, up to Aden, down to
Mauritius and over to Cape-
town, at sea for weeks without
firing an angry shot, savored
monotony to the full. Though
men of the Middle East divi-
sions will remember her. More
than halfway to Capetown with
Queen Elizabeth, Mauretania
and Aquitania, she was ordered
back to Fremantle. Her com-
manding officer, Captain (now
Rear-Admiral) H. B, Farncomb,
requested permission to steam
down the convoy-lines before de-
taching. This was granted.
The big convoy was in two
lines. The cruiser swung in a
wide circle astern, and, picking
up speed, slid her heavily-gunned
length between the lines of
merchantmen like a cheetah
among bullocks; a few yards
from each liner, bow wave spurt-
ing like the jet of a fire-hose,
and her crew cheering, and
cheered by, the packed trans-
ports as they passed ; then helm
hard-over ahead of the convoy,
and she scooted for the far
horizon.
November, 1940, found her
again in Fremantle. Most of
her crew were ashore when the
signal came: “Slip and proceed
with dispatch.” A merchant-
man, Port Brisbane, had been
sunk by a raider in the Indian
Ocean, and the cruiser, seriously
undermanned with part of her
crew still ashore, raced to pick

“TRADE UNIONISM IN DANGER”
Says Company Chairman
Speaking on the Directors’ Report of Prestige Ltd.,
Mr. G. G. Foletta said:—
Record turnovers were a feature of
both the parent# Company’s accounts and
of our consolidated figures. These records
are, unfortunately, more due to the high
ruling prices for merchandise than to large
increases in production. Nevertheless, I
am pleased to report that we are making
some progress from the standpoint of in-
creased production. Any increases under
to-day’s short labour supply position in-
dicate commendable resolve on the part
of the management, staff and employees
generally towards that drive 1 for produc-
tion which Australia must make if she is
going to help the Empire and at the same
time improve her own standard of living.
Mr. Chifley has returned from England
convinced of the Empire’s needs, and we
must commend him on his determination
to do all in his power to increase produc-
tion. Already overtures are being made
for employer-employee conferences on a
high level, but I am inclined to share Mr.
Chifley’s scepticism about the results likely
to be attained, for whatever such a con-
ference should agree upon will be sabo-
taged and, equally, whatever action the
Government should take will be thwarted
unless we, as individual citizens, and par-
ticularly the genuine Trade Unionists
amongst us, decide to rebel against those
subversive leaders who consider any lame
excuse for a strike a sufficient one, pro-
viding it disrupts our Australian economy.
Why let us “pull wool over our eyes” ?
The real issue to-day can not be resolved
either by conferences or by governmental
action. Some think the Government
should act immediately and *it may have
to, but really, what Union.will take kindly
to Government interference in its affairs?
In truth then real progress can only be
made when John Citizen himself takes the
law into his own hands and rids hia
Unions of those forces which will other-
wise finally overthrow them. Upon Aus-
tralian workers generally, and Trade
Unionists in particular, is being placed
all the odium of today’s unsettled and
short-supplied position, but what I want
to know is, where are those horrible
workers who are trying to drag Australia
down?
There are few, if any, among the
working people I meet. My acquaintances
are many, and without fear of contradic-
tion I would say I know none who purpose-
fully desire to give anything but a fair
day’s work for a fair day’s pay. Where
production is being restricted I feel con-
vinced that it is the minority and not the
majority that are behind restriction. I
can not bring myself to believe that any
decent Australian has such a grudge
against society that he wilfully does as
little as he can for as much as he can
get. By the same token lam sure the
same artisan or self-respecting miner must
feel somewhat ashamed and degraded when
led “by the nose” into a purposeless
strike. Our disruptionists seem to have
run out of excuses for strikes against em-
ployers, so they are now striking against
society on any pretext on which they
think they can call a strike and cause
further misery and disruption, and who
are suffering?—employers, yes, but not
nearly to the same degree as fellow-
Unionists and their dependants. So far
behind is Australia’s production that even
though wages rise, householders must con-
tinue to go without comforts and necessi-
ties and the houseless without homes.
There is no doubt about the need for
homes, yet under the present material
short supply and uncertain labour con-
ditions, prices have become so high that
as a result the issue of permits for dwell-
ings for Melbourne Metropolitan Area
have fallen from: April 1177, May 874,
to June 613. Every man should own his
home, but at to-day’s prices this is im-
possible.
The facts are that under the guise of
improving working conditions in one in-
dustry after another, workers are pitted
not so much against employers but against
the best interests of one another. Let
this sort of thing continue and prices,
despite controls, must rise beyond the
public’s ability to pay, then gone will
be our resolve for full employment. Ripe,
then, will be the time for the opportunist
to steal from the Australian citizens that
freedom and true democracy which the
results of the last Referendum showed
they so keenly prized. Trade Unionism
has allowed itself to become sabotaged by
a small band of anarchists, and not until
individual decent Australian Unionists de-
cide that they and they alone can clean
out this cankerous growth, will Trade
Unionism regain the respect even of
Unionists, let alone the average Australian
citizen.
As usual, I have become political, but
I trust Shareholders will forgive me be-
cause in pure fact neither this nor any
other secondary industry can really give
of its best under existing industrial con-
ditions, particularly in key industries. I
am pleased to say we maintain a very
happy relationship with our employees,
and I would here like to sincerely thank
them for their genuine desire to co-
operate.
“Mr. G. G.
Director.”
During the course of the Meeting Mr.
F. H. Foster, speaking on behalf of the
Board, informed shareholders that some
time ago Mr. Foletta requested the per-
mission of the Board to retire from the
exacting office of Managing Directorship.
While the Board were loathe to relieve Mr.
Foletta of this important responsibility,
they recognised that he had for many
years given long and faithful service to
the Company. They also recognised that
the company had grown and that the re-
sponsibilities connected with both its
government and that of its many subsid-
iaries required the services of more than
one senior executive. As a result it was
finally resolved that Mr. Foletta should
continue to give the Company the benefit
of his experience and advice as Govern-
ing Director of the Prestige Group, and
that to Mr. L. S. Gough, the Company’s
General Manager, should be entrusted the
position of Managing Director.
“Mr, li. S. Gough—New Managing
Director.”
In introducing Mr. Gough to the share-
holders as the Company’s new Managing
Director, Mr. Foletta spoke appreciatively
of Mr. Gough’s endeavours during his over
20 years’ association with the Company
and said —“It is with great pleasure that
I now hand over my major responsibilities
to Mr. Gough, for I do so with the know-
ledge that not only will the Company
benefit from the wealth of his experience,
but that the ‘Spirit of Prestige’ will be
in safe keeping.”
In acknowledging his appointment, Mr.
L. S. Gough, the new Managing Director,
said: “The appointment to the Managing
Directorship of our Company is a very
great honour, and I am grateful to our
Chairman and to the members of the
Board for their confidence in me. It
would be wrong to say that I had no
personal pride and satisfaction in my
appointment, for I am too proud of our
Company’s achievements not to appreci-
ate and value its Managing Directorship,
but any feeling of elation is far out-
weighed by my appreciation of the re-
sponsibilities and problems which he
ahead. I am also sobered by the know-
ledge that I am taking from one for
whom I have the greatest respect and
affection, a responsibility which he has
carried so nobly and with such magnifi-
cent results over those many years, but
heartened to know that he will remain at
my elbow to help, encourage and advise
in the spirit of friendly understanding
which has always existed between us.
I have the reassuring knowledge that
behind me, loyally engaged in the Com-
pany’s interests, is a fine staff of men
upon whose enthusiasm and ability our
future will so greatly depend. Our Secre-
tary Mr. Fawcett, has worked loyally at
my side throughout the years, and I am
indeed fortunate and happy to undertake
my greater responsibilities supported by
him and such an experienced and loyal
staff.”'


ABORIGINALITIES.
“Eastern”: Bert had lived alone so
long that news of his approaching
marriage came as a surprise to his
neighbors on Wild Dog Creek. From
his humpy near the bend old Jake
watched Bert depart townward garbed in
his best suit, and next day he got an
eyeful of the utility’s return carrying a
bulky figure on the seat alongside the
driver. For a time after that Jake
avoided Bert’s place; but, the tobacco
shortage eventually getting the better of
him, he wandered over. Entering through
the netted garden, he caught sight of
Bert in the kitchen and diffidently crept
in. “Aw, she ain’t here,” Bert answered
his look. “It’s what a man gets for
marryin’ a town girl. Said she’d never
get used to country ways an’ beat it back
home. Yair, an’ after all these improve-
ments I put in.” He indicated a couple
of small lizards on the table and shelf.
“They catch the flies, them bloodsuckers,”
“Looks as if We'll have to call back, Joe"
he explained. “Seventeen, there are. Took
me two days to get them, an’ the dozen
blue-tongues that’s shut in the garden to
clean up the snails.” He paused as a
rustling sounded overhead. “Yair, an’
that’s another thing,” he growled. “The
old black snake from me haystack. Re-
member? Had a awful job getting’ him
here, an’ I only done it ’cos the place
seemed to be gettin’ overrun, an’ I read
that females is frightened o’ mice. But,
there y* are,” Bert shrugged resignedly,
“If y’ ask me, y’ just can’t please a
woman!”
“C.A.L.”: Over a few beers pulled
from the solitary pump of the shanty set
in the middle of the Topar Plain, the two
drovers were discussing the dry state of
the stock-routes. “Don’t try the Paroo
track with a mob,” one admonished the
other, “I’ve never ever seen it in such
a bad way. It’s so bad the frogs are
dying from dust on the lungs!”
* * ♦ *
“Mat’s Mate”; We were in the Kelly
country, somewhere near Whorouly on
the Ovens, doing a bit of suckering on a
tobacco-farm while we awaited the de-
livery of posts to a fencing line. Baching
in a hut, we depended on the farmer to
bring out our supplies. Things went
along well enough for about three weeks ;
then the posts came and we called on the
farmer for a settling before beginning the
contract. You ought to have heard Mat
when he found that' we were being
charged a shilling a mile cartage on the
orders brought from town! “How long’s
this bin goin’ on?” he roared. “Ever
since I can remember,” said the farmer.
“We have t’ pay cartage, why shouldn’t
you?” Mat looked at him, then down
at the sleepy river and up to the frowning
hills. “It’s no flamin’ wonder,” he said,
bitterly, “that the Kellys took t’ the
bush.”
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: “Betcha” (B.
14/7/’4B) is right—crows do wake up to
a netted trap after one catch and still
hang around more wary than ever. At
Tongar homestead (mid-Murray) during
one drought we trapped our annual catch
and dipped the lot in an oil-and-white-
wash preparation. Next day as we let
the Kellys out we had some fine trap-
shooting. However, the few white-fliers
that escaped the guns made after their
black mates, who went off like blazes for
points west. Anyway, we didn’t see a
crow for months, and one of our
camouflaged birds was seen 40 miles away
still disturbing his black brothers.

“Conda”: While agreeing with “Bug-
house’s” theory (B. 4/8/’4B) of what
happens to a ship sunk in deep water, am
undecided as to how a diver, subjected
to currents strong enough to “collapse
the ship into a pile of steel plates on the
seabed,” managed to recover her bullion
and return to tell the tale,
* * * *
“Point Peron”: Although the octopus
might be reckoned as entirely devoid of
brain, it is possibly the only creature,
other than man, that can find a way out
of that simplest of traps—the inverted
truncated cone. This cone, or funnel, is,
of course, the main feature or the lobster-
or crayfish-trap. Laid sideways it fulfils
the same function as the drum-net or
fish-trap. Dropped to the floor of the
sea the cray-pot, or -trap, lures the
crustacean up over its rim and then down
its funnel by means! of bait inside. And,
once in, the cray is incapable of getting
out; it moves around the bottom, ele-
vates itself against the basketwork sides,
but never thinks of going straight up
through the funnel. The octopus has an
appetite for cray. Lowering itself down
the funnel it will reside inside the trap
while it diligently cleans up all the im-
prisoned crustaceans. The job completed,
it then reaches round with any one of its
eight arms, finds the apex of the funnel
entrance and goes out. Many a cray-
fisherman along the W.A. south-west
coast has found a big octopus in his pots,
the visitor not having completed his meal!
In other pots at times have been found
only empty cray-shell,

“B. A. Ker”; Mac is a one-joke man,
Over the years, at every lodge “sing, say
or pay” he has! always told the same
chestnut about the Maori who, finding a
contented-looking cat on the table beside
a plate that had held 41b. of butter, placed
the feline on the scales in order to com-
pletely establish guilt. The balances
registered exactly 41b. At this stage
Mac invariably does the accent—with a
strong Scotch twang: “Py Corry ; t’ere
is te butter all right; but where te prazes
is te cat?” Recently, while putting in
the foundations for his future home, Mac
discovered that truth is stranger than
fiction, and called on me to witness the
phenomenon. Mixing his cement-mortar,
he measured out three kero.-buckets of
“Cross my palm with silver, sir, and I'll read your bumps."
sand, then one bucket of cement. When
the dry ingredients had been sufficiently
mixed he made a hole in the mixture and
added a little more than one bucketful
of water. Two or three minutes later the
mortar was ready for use. “Now watch
this,” the Scot ordered, and, filling the
bucket, carried it to one of the mortar-
boards. Three trips and the heap of
mortar was gone. Thus, three buckets of
sand, one of cement and more than one
of water had been carried in three
bucketfuls! At that moment Mrs. Mac
arrived with the billy and picnic lunch.
Threequarters of an hour later Mac
picked up his trowel and dug it into the
cement-mortar —the stuff had become so
hard that it needed pints of water to
make it workable’again! Mac scratched
his head as he always did when imperson-
ating the Maori. “Well,” he said, looking
up at the clouded sky, “it didn’t evapo-
rate. And,” looking down at the sheet-
iron mortar-boards, “it didn’t soak away.
Where did that water go?” Well, where
did it go, anyway?
* * * *
“Solitude”: Seventyfiver was just
ahead of me coming in from the run, and
as I rode in I found him standing in the
yard sorrowfully contemplating his nag.
“Looks a bit worn,” I remarked, swing-
ing off. “Yair.” The old bloke shook
his head. “Only good for summer. I
better take Punch t’morrer.” For a
couple of days he used his old dumper,
changed again to a nimble little mare,
and at the end of the week announced his
intention of visiting the saleyards to see
if he could pick up a decent hack.
“Good ’uns is gettin’ hard t’ find,” he
mourned. “Seem t’ be dyin’ out.”
“What’s the matter with the grey?” I
asked. “Or old Punch? They do me all
right.” He eyed me quizzically. “Yair?
Well, I ain’t sayin’ nothin’ about that,
Sol,” he answered. “But what I want in
a nag is stayin’-power, see? Guts.
Somethin’ that’ll keep up a good steady
bat all day, up hill an’ down an’ no
bangin’ back. Them summer nags is
right enough if you’re ridin’ ’em all day,
but no good this weather. Gripes, a
bloke’d freeze if he didn’t get orf an’
step along a good part o’ the time an’
lead his nag.”
* * * *
“Nubis”: Did Sir William Buffer (B.
21/7/’4B) really believe that birds can be
ventriloquists? Sound-vibrations always
come directly from the source of the
sound, and, although they can be re-
flected, they cannot be “thrown.” That
is, if they originate at point A it is im-
possible for them to come from point B
except as an echo. The art of ventrilo-
quism is to utter the sounds in such a
manner as to make them appear to come
from point B. This is done by misdirect-
ing the observer’s attention to point B—
for example, by exhibiting a “talking”
doll with grotesquely-moving mouth.
Ventriloquism, like sleight-of-hand and
water-divining, is just a confidence trick.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Old Mac was crossing
from the chaff-shed to the house when an
apparition materialised from the night,
went past him with a roar and vanished
in a cloud of light draperies towards the
pine-clad hill behind the place. Mac
almost fell over backwards, recovered,
rushed inside, got the gun, yelled to the
boys and rushed out again. “Dunno
what it was,” he panted, leading them
towards the pines, “but it was all white
and screamin’ like the devil. Listen! ”
They listened. From up in the pines
came snorts and yells and sounds of
combat. “Get the car,” whispered Mac.
“We can use the headlights, an’ I’d feel
safer in the ear.” Young Charlie backed
the car out, they scrambled in and he
turned it up the rise. Presently the
lights picked out a bounding figure
among the pines and Mac raised the gun.
Then he peered again and lowered it.
“Drive back,” he said curtly. They put
the car away and went inside. “Missus,”
said Mac to his scared wife, “y’ would
have that poddy in the yard. Well, he’s
up in the pines now an’ tangled round
his horns is most o’ them sheets y’ had
han'ging on the line.” Then Mrs. Mac’s
fright vanished and the row began.
* * * *
“Blime”: George had lost one of his
sheepdogs, and, hearing old Charlie had
an overgrown pup that showed promise,
he rode over. “Yair, I wouldn’t mind
sellin’ him,” Charlie agreed. “Y’ can
have him for a quid if he’s any good, but
in case he ain’t y’ better have him on
trial for a week or two. Wait an’ I’ll call
him.” He whistled, and a large shaggy
brute lumbered round the corner. George
took him in interestedly, blinked at the
color and decided on the trial. A week
later he was back at old Charlie’s with
the dog in tow. “No good?” asked
Charlie as he caught sight of them.
“Wouldn’t he work?” “Aw, I dunno
about that,” George told him, “He
might’ve if I’d been on me own. But it
weren’t fair to Nigger to keep him. That
mong’s overworked as it is. It’s the color,
I s’pose. Didn’t mind it meself, him
bein’ that dirty white, but Nig couldn’t
believe it. Every time we went out he
insisted on musterin’ the new mong and
drivin’ him in with the mob o’ jummies.”
* * * *
“Muskeen”: Those cowbell-responding
wethers (B. 4/8/’4B) bring back
memories of Roper Valley station (NT.)
in the early 1900’s, The poultry were
under the care of a lubra whose method
of collecting her charges for their even-
ing meal was to blow a couple of blasts
on a motor-horn, which had in some
manner found its way to the Valley,
although no automobile had yet made its
appearance. The first motor-car to visit
the homestead gave a farewell “Honk!
Honk!” on its departure. Every fowl
on the place immediately stood to atten-
tion, then sprinted in pursuit of the
vehicle. That was the last that was ever
seen of them.
* * * *
“Dusty Mile”: The stranger was
pompous and elegant, and the little Gulf
pub was inspired to such niceties as sheets
for his bed. The guest, after holding
court in the bar, sought out his chamber,
and there his indignant protests awakened
Rummy, who, in search of a resting-place
and fascinated by the rare spectacle of
sheets, had retired between them.
Rummy moved over invitingly. “Kick
yer crabs off, mate, before yer hop in,”
he warned. “There’s sheets on this bed.
At this stage Bung appeared and opened
up with verve. “You dirty cow,” he
yelled at the occupant; “crawlin’ into a
nice clean bed in that lousy clobber.
I’ll have to get them sheets washed now,
an’ they haven’t been used more than a
time or two.” Yanking Rummy out, he
wiped the bottom sheet with the inter-
loper’s hat. “She’ll be jake now, mate,'
he assured the deflated guest as he pro-
pelled Rummy through the door.
THE HOMESTEAD.
So still the air that the curtains
Lift in no breath of air;
The curled brown leaf on the stair
Lies where it drifted yesterday
When the south wind blustered there.
O, quiet lies the country
About this weathered place—
It seems in the sparkling space
Where an afternoon is an era
That the essence of a race
Finds voice and speaks in the silence;
The folk from whom I come
Lie buried not and dumb
But stir like winter’s petals
When winds of August thrum
Till the house that was erst so quiet
Is filled with a phantom breeze
Awakening memories
.That give out wholesome fragrance
In an age of dark unease.
Faces in faded portraits;
Timbers inured to rain
And sun; and old trees remain;
Set in their place by hands that
Will never toil again.
O spirits who knew Australia
When our own race was young,
These peaceful rooms among
Weave leaf-fragrant blessings
. In your archaic tongue
That blends with the call of the pigeon
And the magpie’s organ-note
On the brilliant noon afloat,
Where the creek chants lays our fathers
Loved and knew by rote.
Sunlight dies on the ranges;
Mown paddocks veiled in bloom
Fade in the autumn gloom
Drugged with long swathes’ fragrance.
Dark grows my quiet room.
Old house, we have known together
So many silences
Whence peace of the wilderness
With a sacerdotal gesture
Put out calm hands to bless.
Well for this happy country
That basks in its even clime
That there rode these hills one-time
Patriots who loved her
And strove for her in their prime.

“G’roper”: Granted that the Speck’s
coastline may be well sprinkled with
romantic names (B. 28/7/’4B), but on
what are they based? The only part of
our continent that ever knew the impact
of pirates, for instance, was W.A., where
the coastal nomenclature is commonplace.
Take that 16th-century mutiny of the
crew of the Batavia, the forerunner of an
intended pirate cruise, which resulted in
the murder of 120 people ; the adven-
turous voyage of Pelsart in the ship’s
longboat, first up the barren coast of our
mainland, then across the sea to Java ;
and the return later in the frigate Saar-
dam. All this ended in the capture, trial,
torture on the rack and final hanging of
Jerome Cornelius and his accomplices,
though with two exceptions—two young
mutineers, still in their early twenties,
who were mercifully spared by Pelsart’s
marine Court, the sentence of death being
commuted to marooning on the mainland
somewhere in the vicinity of what is now
Shark’s Bay. All of this is smothered
under the flat name of the Abrolhos
Islands. Then take Dampier on board
the Cygnet, held practically as a captive
by the piratical crew, which after trick-
ing Captain Swan out of his ship, even-
tually came south to King Sound, where
in what is now called Cygnet Bay the
hooker was careened and scraped. By all
the evidence that bay was a well-known
careening-place for the pirates of the
Indian Ocean.

“L. de F.”: The 1 new neighbor was a
most polite man. He bowed very low
when lie came over, called Mum Madam
and asked permission to smoke before
lighting up. Mum, always impressed by
anything that savored of good family,
served tea in the front room, d’oyleys
and all. Unfortunately it was one of
“those days”—there was only carraway-
cake and last Friday’s bread. But Mr.
Newcome pronounced it excellent and
sat there making polite conversation in
between bites of cake and carefully
digging out carraway-seeds from it with
his fingernail and placing them in a tidy
heap at the side of his plate. Mum
watched in pained surprise until she could
stand it no longer. “Don’t you like
carraways, Mr. Newcome?” she asked.
“Carraways! Are they really? I beg
your pardon. I thought they were ants! ”
We had nearly forgotten what they were
like, too. It was the first we had had
from the store since the war.

“Lower Tops’!’ ’: Mention of the
Edina’s great age (B. 23/7/’4B) recalls
that the veteran of Tassie’s trading
ketches—the Huon Chief —is seven years
her senior and still sailing the seas. The
33-ton green-hulled hooker first took
the water on the Huon River in 1849, in
the days when shipwrights knew their
job, and When stands of the 1000-year-old
Huon pine were plentiful. Originally the
vessel was constructed throughout of the
softwood, but this century her keel and
sternpost have been replaced with red-
gum. Never a flier, this old sailer has
competed intermittently in the race for
trading ketches in the Derwent for 75
years without a win. At this year’s
Hobart regatta her sail number was
appropriately 99.

“Bo”; The friends and relatives of the
bride and her ’groom who packed the
small bush church sensed there was some-
thing wrong when, shortly after the best
man had fished the wedding ring from his
pocket, there came a whispered consulta-
tion between the officiating clergymen
and the couple whose vows he was about
to bless. Then the tension relaxed, and
fears that one or other of the contracting
parties was about to crawfish were dis-
sipated as, with his hand up to his mouth,
the ’groom took a step back and said to
the best man, in a stage-whisper that
could be heard back at the door: “The
blasted ring’s too small, Alf —duck out
“All right, HI have you reinstated immediately. Now run along and
play. I'M busy.”
and get a fistful o’ grease, will y? You’ll
find the grease-gun in the toolbox o’ the
utility!”
* * * *
“Gumsucker”: Re “Zake’s” poser (B.
28/7 / ’4B), I should say that the equine
hindquarters do most of the work in
heavy pulling. My memory goes back to
times when horses pulled as I have never
seen them pull since: the house-shifting
days of the Victorian goldfields. It was
no uncommon thing to see six-roomed
houses built of hardwood dragged on a
big jinker over heavy clay soil, often
sodden with rain. Plenty of horses were
used in those teams, but often, when a
house and jinker became “stuck,” the task
seemed almost too great. With the wheels
sinking ever deeper, and the poor brutes
straining every muscle and sinew, it was
the hindquarters that crouched low, the
hind feet scrabbling at the soil for a foot-
hold. Later, in Coolgardie, an old-time
teamster pointed out the difference be-
tween a horse and a camel. The oont
isn’t worth much as a puller, being
markedly deficient in the hindquarters,
just where the horse is developed to the
maximum.

“Uramao”: The parson, taking as his
text an Epistle of St. Paul, emphasised
to his Maori congregation the point made
by the great apostle that no woman
should enter the church with head un-
covered, his dusky flock being but rarely
observant of this doctrine. The matter
was debated at the pa, and at first the
theologians found the paucity of head-
covering among the'wahines a grave diffi-
culty. But next Sunday a crowd of Maori
women assembled at the church door.
The first one to enter had on her head a
battered old tile that might have been
worn by the first European whaler to
arrive in Maoriland. She reverently entered
the sacred edifice, and when seated
pitched the hat through the window. An-
other woman caught it, pulled it on and
entered. The same process continued till
about 40 or them were in the church.
They had obeyed the scriptural injunction
that no woman should enter the temple
uncovered ; the matter of remaining un-
covered in church was to them a matter
St. Paul hadn’t been clear about.

“Zake”; One of the things I have
always marvelled at is the superb confi-
dence of the adze-artist as he operates
with such an infinitesimal margin between
his toe and the point where his razor-
sharp tool shaves the fencepost or sleeper
he is working on. One of the things to
make your heart miss a beat is to watch
while he looks up casually as his adze
falls —exactly on the point he knows it
will hit. I haven’t heard of one shaving
himself with his adze, though it wouldn’t
surprise me. But I met one adze-wielder
who used to cut his plug-tobacco with it.
He also scorned the use of a penknife to
sharpen his pencil. Held between his
big toe and the next, he could get a
point on a pencil with his lightly-falling
adze that looked as if it had been in an
office pencil-sharpener.

“Colonial Cove”: Guildford grass (B.
28/7/’4B) was described as a potential
menace in the Swan River “Guardian”
as far back as 1837 by W. Nairne Clark,
a lawyer-journalist of the early Swan
River Settlement. As to how the grass
got to Java —well, the Dutch were in
occupation there and also at the Cape
for quite 200 years before Captain Fre-
mantle hoisted the British flag at the
mouth of the Swan. Also, the Dutch,
like the English, habitually tried out all
sorts of plants and productions in their
overseas territories. That is how we
came to have the Cape gooseberry,
brought to Australia from the Cape,
though really a native of South America.
Capeweed is another exotic we owe to
the Dutch, imported into W.A. among
fodder from the Cape. Even the soil in
some of the tubs that the Parmelia
brought may have come originally from
the Cape, for all the plants thus brought
were not tropical; the Dutch may have
sold-off some of their own failures, which
Shell took hoping that they would do
well in a temperate climate. Incidentally,
the blame put on Walter Padbury for
Guildford grass is understandable in view
of the fact that in the late eighteen-
forties he became part lessee of Stirling’s
Guildford estate.
* * * *
“8.A.K.”: A gentle footnote to
“C.V.E.’s” “correction” (B. 4/8/’4B). I
did not “overlook the fact that, unlike
the rabbit, the invariable litter of a hare
is two.” But Ido refuse to accept the
statement as a fact. To concede such a
point, and be consistent, it would be
necessary to insist, also, that a cow in-
variably has one calf at a calving, or a
ewe one lamb only. This in spite of the
fact that authentic cases of twin calves
are recorded; twin lambs could scarcely
be called a novelty, and possibly many
people beside myself have seen triplet
jumbucks. It is unusual to see a litter of
more than five pups, but if it could be
said that canines invariably have that
number and no more, then a red setter
of my acquaintance must have borrowed
four little balls of personality to add to
her other five. Such a hard-and-fast
rule couldn’t even be applied to Homo
sapiens. Although one at a time is con-
sidered good fishin’, twins could hardly
be called “news.” Triplets might get in
the papers, but even five is not a record.
The Dionnes were neither the first nor the
last set of quintuplets born ; they became
renowned throughout the world because
they were the first set that had lived. To
return to hares: I’ve seen several litters
of three, and once I saw a litter of four.

“Blake”: The pig that drank the
bucketful of skim-milk and didn’t weigh
any more (B, 21/7/’4B) must have been
some relation to the little grunter my
grandmother used to puzzle over. Gran
couldn’t make out how, when she gave it
a bucketful of milk, he still fitted neatly
into the bucket after quaffing it and none
of him sticking over. If he didn’t weigh
any more, either, then the milk evidently
doesn’t simply solidify. So what?
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: “Bughouse” (B.
21/7/’4B), who quarrels with my defini-
tion that “light is that form of motion
or energy capable of affecting the organs
of sight and thus rendering visible the
objects from which it proceeds,” may
submit his correction to my authority,
The Twentieth Century Dictionary —
latest edition. But first let him consider
his example of light penetrating to the
prisoner in his dungeon. Light from
what? From the sun? But the prisoner
had access to air also. Does “Bughouse”
believe that sufficient air to maintain life
would penetrate brick walls? Or would
there be vents through which both air
and light might be admitted? Now re-
read my definition, particularly that part
about “the objects from which it pro-
ceeds.” Every element has its own par-
ticular ray emanating from it —a fact
availed of by the scientist to discover the
composition of stars and planets. The
instrument used, the spectroscope, splits
up the ray from an object and analyses it
into its different parts, providing a clear
picture of the different elements com-
bining to produce that ray. The walls of
“Bughouse’s” dungeon conceivably
emitted rays which would be capable of
affecting eyes whose muscles were
strengthened by the constant attempt to
employ* them. Add this to the light
which would penetrate at least as easily
as the air which kept the prisoner alive
and you have sufficient to lighten the
most abysmal darkness.
WOULD MEN MAKE CAGES THEN?
If for a golden moment men
The magic flight of birds could capture
And wild songs sing with bursting rapture,
Would men make cages then?
Could they with wind-whipped feathers feel
The rushing air, so fresh, so free;
Like flashing jewels swiftly wheel
From tree to cloud, from cloud to tree;
O could they fly and sweetly sing,
And singing fly on high, on high,
So lightly soar on curving wing
Toward the sun, across the sky,
Then downward glide, and gliding bring
Their songs to earth; I ask, I cry—
Were that swift hour God’s gift to men,
Would men make cages then?

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
That Income Tax.
“Graz”: Erroneous advice
has been given to graziers that
by buying stock in June the
purchase money will be deducted
from their income. It is only a
half-truth. If I pay £3OOO for
1500 ewes in June I will have to
include the number and amount
in the Live Stock Schedule in
column “A” of the return. If
I hold the ewes at June 30 I
will also have to include them,
number and cost, together with
the rest of my stock in column
“B” as “Stock (including all
natural increase) on hand at
June 30, 1948.” The Commis-
sioner would determine my in-
come from stock by taking the
difference in the cash columns of
“A” and “B.” As the £3OOO
would be included in both, my
sheep purchase would not en-
title me to any deduction what-
ever.
Another problem; Graziers
are required to state gross sales
of skins. They are required to
add to their income the value
of stock killed for rations. This
would obviously include skin
value. Those who include as
income the value of stock killed
for rations and also the sale of
their skins obviously pay taxa-
tion twice on the same income.
I don’t know whether it com-
plies strictly with the taxation
Act, but on principle I refuse to
include as income receipts for
skins the value of which is in-
cluded under “Stock killed for
rations.” I won’t pay tax twice
on the same income, even if Mr.
Chifley threatens to jug me for
life.
Lambs in Queensland.
“Archaps”: The sheep- and
wool-adviser at Dalby (Q.), H.
D. Hallam, says that Dorset
Horn and Southdown rams to
mate with crossbred ewes were
particularly suitable for Queens-
land, but though the Southdown
excelled for production of the
ideal carcass some breeders con-
tended that the cross required
ideal conditions, otherwise the
lambs matured before reaching
the required weight; if held to
obtain the weight they made ex-
cessive fat. The Dorset Horn
cross grew rapidly, which was a
distinct advantage under
Queensland conditions, and the
rams were more manageable
than Southdowns.
In New Zealand, said Hallam,
birth weights varied from 7.71 b.
for Merinos to 11.91 b. for Rom-
neys. In West Australia experi-
ments showed that lambs sired
by Downs rams from Merino
ewes averaged 8.81 b., against
10.41 b. for lambs by the same
rams, from Border Leicester-
Merino cross ewes.
W.A. trials had also shown
the importance of feeding. The
variation in time taken by
lambs to reach slaughter at 651 b.
live-weight ranged from three to
six days between dams which
were well fed and those poorly
fed. In N.S.W. and Victoria
lambs well fed from birth reached
a live-weight of 1001 b. in 16
weeks, whereas lambs poorly
fed from birth weighed only
501 b. at 16 weeks. Lambs grown
on a high-ration scale had a
nice balance of fat, muscle and
bone.
In any breeding programme
it was necessary to use Merinos,
and the most popular first
crosses were 8.L.-Merino and
Romney-Merino, the latter being
most popular in heavier-rainfall
areas. Corriedale-Merino-cross
ewes made good mothers,
usually had a longer breeding
season than the other crosses
and cut a heavier and more
valuable fleece, but the lambs
were not so good. They were
preferred in marginal areas, their
offspring being good carryovers.
Pig-breeding.
“Mr.”: Frequently sows
thought to be close to farrowing
are not in pig, which means a
big loss of time, food and pad-
dock-room. Losses can be cut
by keeping written records of
mating-dates to enable the sows
to be checked in 21 days. L. A.
Downey, a Vic. pig expert, says
that failure to breed may be in
either boar or sow. Deficien-
cies in diet are a frequent cause
of sterility. Downey asks,
“When his pigs fail to breed,
how long should a pigraiser
persevere with them in the hope
of getting them to breed again?”
Value of the sow as a back-
fatter or chopper must be con-
sidered in relation to her value
as a prospective but doubtful
breeder and the cost of replac-
ing her with another sow. In
Downey’s opinion it’s usually
more economical to sell a poor-
breeding sow and replace her.
Victorian Stock.
“Mr.”; According to the
Statist horse numbers show a
further drop compared with
1947. The decline has been pro-
gressive over the past 30 years
and shows no tendency to
slacken, despite the foal bonus
which the State pays—£4 for
every foal by a registered
draught stallion from an ap-
proved mare. Victoria’s! horse
population is 221,454 —less than
half the 1915 figure (552,053).
Dairy - cattle numbers are
rising. The increase, 64,751,
was largely due to a State-
wide campaign, run by the De-
partment of Agriculture and the
Soldier Settlement Commission
urging farmers to raise more
calves. Beef cattle are on the
increase, and have picked up
by 170,000 on the 527,318 head
“Could you do with another drink, Petal ?”
carried at the end of the 1945-46
drought.
Sheep, at 17,931,173, are still
below the record 1942 figure
(20,598,201). Western District
carried 5,664,641 head during
the year, but in the Mallee, Wim-
mera and North numbers are
well below pre-drought levels.
Stopping Wheelspin.
“Nubis”: Best way to load
the back wheels of the tractor
to prevent wheelspin (B.
14/7/ ’4B) is to water-inflate the
tyres. They must not be fully
inflated, as this turns them, in
effect, into solid tyres, and they
will soon crack up. A water-
hose valve coupling is required.
Jack the tyre up, rotate it until
the valve is uppermost and re-
move the core from the valve-
stem (or, if fitted with water-
inflation valve, remove valve-
stem). Connect the water-hose
and fill the tyre up to the level
of the Valve. It may be fed
direct from the water supply by
gravity or by a semi-rotary
hand-pump.
It will be necessary to “bleed”
the tyre occasionally to reduce
the back air-pressure. . This is
done simply by disconnecting
the coupling. Fill until valve-
level is reached—allow surplus
water to drain off —replace the
valve core (or stem), then with
air-pump inflate to correct pres-
sure. Never use water-inflated
tyres until this has been done.
Minimum-pressure front tyres
281 b., rear tyres 121 b. To re-
move the water it is only neces-
sary to jack the tyre up, revolve
wheel until valve is underneath,
take out the core and drain.
The drawbar pull of the
tractor is in direct proportion to
the weight on the rear tyres,
varying from between about 25-
401 b. to each 1001 b; on rear tyres
in dry sand to 501 b. or more in
clay. Minimum desirable
weights per rear wheel (13.50
tyres) recommended by Dunlops
are as follows:
Approx.
Wheel Liquid
Diam. Tyre. Wheel. Wgt. Ballast. Total.
Lb. Lb. Lb. Lb. Lb.
24in. 185 370 150 325 1030
28in. '2OO 450 150 370 1170
32in. 230 550 150 390 1320
Dry Fowlyards.
“Urana”: All runs should be
built on a slope, so that rain
can run away and not lie
around. It is disagreeable for the
fowls—and also for the persons
attending to them —to have to
puddle around in sodden and
slippery ground, and good lay-
ing results cannot be expected
under such conditions. The best
disease-spreader is stale water
lying around. The hens must be
dry if they are to be healthy.
Try tipping a load or two of
sand and cinders in the yards and
spreading them out. If you are
pressed for time the fowls will
soon scatter it for themselves.
As well as making a firm, dry
surface, these materials’ are ex-
cellent as grit and are an asset
to any yard which has been in
use for a long time.
Basing a Machine.
“Radian”: Assuming that the
machine is light—weighing cwts.
and not tons —there are two
methods. In the first a wooden
frame is made up of suitable
dimensions' on which to mark
off the holding-down bolts. The
holes are bored, bolts inserted
and nuts run on loosely. Re-
member that the underside of
the frame represents the finished
surface of concrete, so that bolts
must be adjusted up or down to
suit the sole plate of the
machine. Using the shaft centre-
line as a basis, set the frame on
the boxing of the excavation and
nail in position. Concrete should
now be poured, ramming well,
until excavation and boxing are
filled. Particulars of concrete
for machinery foundations are
readily available from cement
companies. When dried suffi-
ciently the surface may be
trowelled off flat, using at the
same time a wooden straight-
edge across the edges of the
boxing.
The second method offers
some advantages, although
slower. The concrete is poured
as a slab and finished off flat.
Holding-down bolt-holes are
drilled after the concrete has
hardened,the machine is setup in
line and the bolts grouted in with
a strong cement mix. With this
method there is no frame to in-
terfere with pouring of concrete
and no bolts to hinder the final
trowelling-off of the surface.
Finally check the machine for
level and make sure that the
sole-plate is flat on the concrete
at all points. If small depres-
sions upset either of these fac-
tors shims of any thin sheet-
metal may be inserted as re-
quired.
While these methods are
satisfactory for small machinery,
anything over 15cwt. —particu-
larly engines should be
properly grouted on the founda-
tions, otherwise movement will
occur and the holding-down
bolts will loosen.
Bending Water-pipes.
“J.J.A.”: Make sure the
length of piping is reasonably
clean and hammer a hard
wooden plug tightly into one
end. Stand the pipe upright and
fill with clean dry sand, ramming
gently until the pipe is filled to
within an inch of the top. Drive
a softwood wedge, about 6in.
long, two-thirds of its length into
the open end of the piping to
prevent the escape of the sand.
The length of piping may now
be considered as a solid bar and
treated accordingly. Heat where
the bend is required and bend to
the desired shape.
Dipping Cane Sets.
“Thap”: Some farmers on the
Burdekin (N.Q.) are finding that
it pays to dip the cane sets in a
1 per cent, solution of a mer-
curial preparation before plant-
ing. Not only are germinations
better, but the shoots come
through the ground more quickly,
and there is no rotting of the
sets due to pineapple disease.
A little over two tons of plants
are used per acre, so the dipping
apparatus must be on a fairly
large scale. One farmer has de-
tachable planter boxes, holding

_ j. A . ,
Canadian Agriculture.
“Jock”: In Canada new
sheep breeds are being developed
to give better wool and lamb
returns, and a promising breed
is the Romnelet, from Romney
Marsh rams on Rambouillet
ewes. The best baconer is the
Yorkshire. In beef an attempt
is being made to cross domestic
cattle with the bison to found
a hardy cross with good meat
qualities.
The bee division of the
*f a •
Canadian Department or Agn-
culture says the superior oee
race for most parts of Canada
is the Italian. As the examina-
tion of every comb in the colony
for eggs or larvae in the queen
cells (the first definite sign or
swarming) is too time-consum-
ing, the time for examination
has been reduced to a tenth by
using a divisible brood-chamber.
Bee-feeding with pollen substi-
tutes is practised, and mention is
m ade of one mixture composed
of eight parts of soybean flour
and one part of dried brewers
yeast (medicinal).
The economic loss in power
needed for deep cultivation has
been overcome by showing that
equal yields follow shallow
ploughing. In the prairie pro-
vinces ploughless fallow and the
use of one-way discs, blade- and
rod-weeders to leave a trash
cover” on the surface prevent
soil drift and increase crop
yields- Drift erosion is con-
trolled by strip-farming, sum-
mer fallowing to maintain soil
moisture, and in worse areas by
sowing grass. Experiments with
water erosion showed that, with
a 15in. rainfall, in four months
31 tons of soil per acre were
washed from a corn plot with
rows running up and down a
10-deg. slope. Solution is plant-
ing to grass, or legumes, or
cropping on the contour.
Weed-control leans to the use
of chemicals which selectively
kill weeds without harming
crops or, indeed, increase the
crop yield. Such are copper
sulphate to control mustard in
grain crops, sinox in grain crops
and lawns, 2, 4-D for annual and
perennial weeds in grain and
grass crops. Manure likely to
contain weed seeds is piled in
compact heaps for three months
to destroy the seeds.
Hints for the Farm.
“M.”: Give the orphan pig
cow’s milk rich in fat, a half-
pint at four regular intervals a
day. When three to four weeks
old, reduce the feeds to three
a day, and after the piglet has
been put on crushed grain, sub-
stitute skim milk for the fresh.
Allow it out on pasture occa-
sionally or, if penned, throw a
daily shovelful of fresh earth
into the sty.
“Sundowner”: Rickets in
lambs may be prevented by giv-
ing them a dose of calciferol (25
milligrams) in the smallest
amount of olive oil that can be
conveniently given in the drench-
ing apparatus.
“Muse”; The easiest way to
prepare soil for a lawn is to
plant root vegetables in it. They
should be weeded and hilled
carefully and when the crop is
harvested and the haulms re-
moved the soil will be loose and
crumbly. Firm it into shape,
apply sand and lime and remove
weeds as they appear. Finally
apply a 1-1-2 mixture of sul-
phate of ammonia, blood and
bone and superphosphate. Plant
runners early, or sow seed of
lawn grass in October.
“L.P.”: Small countersunk
screws often give a lot of trouble
by continually working loose
and falling out. This can be
prevented by tightening the
screw and sticking insulation-
tape over the top of it.
“Sarina”: If ants aren’t re-
sponsible for poor seed-germi-
nation (B. 30/6/’4B), letting the
seed-bed dry out usually is. To
keep the moisture in, water the
bed straight after seeding and
then cover the damp surface with
half an inch of finely-powdered
horse - manure. Subsequent
waterings may be given through
this mulch.
“Windsor”: To prevent a
lamp chimney frem cracking
place it in a pot filled with cold
water, add a little common salt,
allow the mixture to boil well
over a fire and cool slowly.
Chimneys become very durable
by this process, and crockery and
porcelain may be treated in the
same manner. The slower the
process, especially the cooling,
the more effective will be the
finished job.

55 YORK STREET, SYDNEY
Down on the water’s edge the
boy was going through one of
his turtle-hunting pantomimes,
and, because the morning was
too perfect to spend indoors or
even on a verandah, the old man
strolled across.
Ignoring the intruder,, the
hunter struggled with his quarry.
It must be a big one this morn-
ing, Old Ben thought, watching
the desperate battle.
Perhaps it was the perfection
of the spring morning or per-
haps it was just the old man’s
newly-discovered loneliness. At
any rate, Old Ben joined in. He
tallied on to the line behind the
boy and together they fought the
imaginary monster till it was
landed, exhausted, on the bank.
The kid was fairly dancing with
excitement, and Old Ben
actually found himself puffing
from the exertion.
“By cripes,” he panted. “That
one plenty big turtle.”
For a moment or two Armit’s
brown eyes regarded him with
something like contempt.
“ ’Snotta turtle,” he announced
at last. “Dis one dugong.”
A bad break, that. Old Ben
'thought. Still, it was a start. The
black boy had spoken to him.
Their friendship began from
that day. They spoke little, for
both were men of action rather
than words, but each morning
they bade each other a solemn
“Good-day.”
One morning a solitary plover
winged his shrill piping way
overhead. When Armit brought
him down with his customary
single shot Old Ben strode
across and, bending down at ex-
actly the right spot, went
through the motions of picking
up the fallen bird and wringing
its neck.
‘ ‘ DLENTY good tucker, this
1 fella,” he remarked
casually.
Under the awkward hat-brim
the brown eyes widened in
amazement, rolling with a flash-
ing of whites from the old man’s
hand to his wrinkled leathery
face.
“You eatum?” he inquired.
Old Ben nodded seriously.
“My word,” he answered. “Sup-
posin’ you come along tonight
about sundown, you taste ’im.”
Just before sundown the boy
called. He would not come in-
side, but stood in the doorway
scratching one thin black leg
with a bare toe. And standing
there, wide-eyed with amaze-
ment, he consumed a leg and a
wing of one of Old Ben’s best
pullets.
For Armit it was no longer a
case of casual friendship but
straightout hero-worship. To
his solemn “Good-day” he now
added a friendly grin, pausing
outside the hut for ten minutes
or more each morning. And
Old Ben gloried in it. Instead of
waiting on his verandah he
strolled across to the tall coco-
nut-palm opposite his door and
leaned casually against its
slender trunk until the kid
joined him.
They made a strange pair, the
tall, bald old man and the small
black boy, standing silently gaz-
ing out over the river. Some-
times, after a lengthy silence,
Armit might say:
“Tide’s cornin’ in.”
And Old Ben, keeping his
eyes fixed on the stretch of clear
green water so obviously swirl-
ing upstream, would answer
gravely;
“Yair. She’s cornin’ in.”
That was enough, but if the
next interval became too pro-
longed the old man would
casually remark: “Well, I s’pose
you’d better be movin’ on,
mate.”
He was; worried about the
youngster’s continued lateness
for school, worried lest the kid
should be too harshly punished
for something he honestly
couldn’t understand. He some-
times wondered if Armit ever
got to the school, and to make
sure he followed him one morn-
ing.
Keeping well in the back-
ground, he watched the crawling
progress. Instead of taking the
obvious short-cut the boy kept
to the riverbank as long as pos-
sible, making his way with pain-
ful slowness past the moored
fishing-boats, along the very
edges of the town wharves and
finally, when the sprawling
warehouses forced him to aban-
don it, making a right-angled
turn to the school. Once away
from the river he changed com-
pletely and became an ordinary
schoolboy, breaking into short
runs, nervously aware of his
lateness and scared of the
punishment that must await
him.
OLD BEN wondered why the
teacher didn’t complain to
the boy’s mother, and then re-
membered it would only be a
waste of time. Clara was too fat
and lazy to bother herself. In a
way he was right, although the
teacher had complained. Several
times he had given Armit notes
to take home to his mother, but
nothing ever came of them. He
blamed Armit for not delivering
them, but there he wronged the
boy. Armit handed over every
one, but notes meant nothing to
Clara. She couldn’t read them,
so she put them carefully away!
She must have had half a dozen
when the policeman called. That
was something Clara could
understand. She had a very real
fear of a police uniform. Chat-
tering like a startled old Black
Orpington, she assured the
policeman that Armit left home
plenty early each day. What he
did after he left she didn’t
know.
“You’d better find out,” the
representative of the law in-
formed her. “He plays the wag
half the morning. Go after him,
and if he doesn’t get a move on
give him a walloping.”
Clara flared at that. “What?”
she demanded. “You askim me
beat my baby all same white
woman! ”
“If you don’t,” the policeman
threatened, “we’ll take him
away and lock him up longa big
jail. Savvy?”
Clara savvied. Whatever
method she used Armit’s pace
quickened from that day. Old
Ben noticed it next morning.
The kid scarcely paused beside
the coconut-palm. There was a
look of fear in his brown eyes
as he moved on, a flock of sea-
gulls wheeled unheeded over-
head, and even when a school of
mullet leaped he scarcely glanced
at the river.
Gradually a change came
over him. His morning greet-
ings to Old Ben became cheer-
fully casual, and at times he
bounded happily along as if
quite keen to reach school.
ONE afternoon Old Ben heard
the shouts of several small
boys outside his hut. He walked
out and saw Armit and five other
boys playing football along the
riverbank. One, a little bigger
than the others, tucked the ball
under his arm and ran, closely
pursued by Armit, Cries of “Go
on, Snowball. Scruff ’im, Snow-
ball,” followed them. Cheered
on by yells of “Good ole Snow-
ball,” Armit wrenched the ball
from the bigger boy and kicked
it towards his barrackers.
Although only a few yards
separated them, he completely
ignored Old Ben’s greeting.
Slowly the old man turned and
walked inside.
“Civilisation! ” he growled.
“What good can it do him?
What good can it do any of
us?”
When Armit passed on his
way to school next morning Old
Ben was furiously beating an
omelette, and his bowed back
was turned resolutely to the
door.

“Talking dog discovered by re-

On my first day reporting for
the Toddyville “Trombone” I,
too, discovered a talking dog.
Our interview went something
like this:
Q.; “I take it you discovered
your powers at an early age?”
A.:/‘Quite young indeed. I
believe that my first word was
the customary ‘hie’.”
Q.: “Have you confined your-
self to English?”
A.: “No. I speak seventeen
languages, swearing in Urdu. I
can also read shorthand, play a
fast game of croquet and am
interested in politics. My club
is ‘The Oaks,’ and I am study-
ing law.”
Q.: “When do you expect to
be called to the Bar?”
Here the dog reverted to a
yelp and leaped the fence, his
owner explaining that listening
to too many symphonic works
by modernist composers had
affected the hound’s hearing, and
that he must have mistaken
“bar” for “bath.”
When I slung the article on
the editor’s desk he was at first
speechless; his first words were
a request for me to save him
what was left in the bottle,
I explained that the dog had not
actually uttered words, but had
given thought-waves which his
owner had interpreted.
After that I was put immedi-
ately on to leader-writing.

Comprehensive Curriculum.
“Applications are being invited
from Canberra for cadetships in the
Diplomatic Service.”
“First of all,” said the Acting-
Temporary - Deputy - Assistant
Diplomatic Instructor (fourth
class) to the class of selected
cadets, “you will be taught the
basic elements of international
diplomacy. For instance, were
you in your Consular capacity to
be introduced at a dinner by,
say, a French diplomat to his
wife, who happened to be about
sixteen stone and with a face
like that of an organiser of a
Communist women’s auxiliary,
it would not be considered to be
in the best diplomatic usage to
blurt out, ‘ ’Struth, Monseer, no
wonder Madame is like the side
of a house —by what she put
away she must have lost her
appetite and found a horse’s.’
The skilled diplomat would
simply whisper in his ear:
‘Madame must have brought a
truly handsome dowry to her
marriage, m’sieu!’
“One important aspect of
your training will be preparation
for service in small countries
where diplomatic representation
is limited to a charge d’affaires.
You might as well know right
from the beginning that you will
have no chance of becoming an
Ambassador —that rank is the
exclusive prerogative of ‘Labor’
Ministers defeated at elections.
The training I mentioned will
involve such requisites as mak-
ing your own furniture out of
fruit-cases, reading confidential
dispatches from Canberra by the
light of a candle stuck in a
bottle and being able, if your
wife isn’t, to make sausage-
mince up into something re-
sembling venison d la Suisse
when you give a necessary
dinner for some distinguished
diplomat or Foreign Minister.
Also, to be able to take cold
showers throughout the winter,
break down whisky with cold tea
for use at receptions and de-
velop a manner that will make
it easy to borrow a typewriter
to enable you to get your dis-
patches away. These economies',
of course, will be essential. Re-
member that the Department of
External Affairs has only a
limited sum voted by Parlia-
ment, and that most of that has
to*be converted into dollars to
enable Dr. Evatt to have at least
three extended holiday trips
abroad each year.
“Another important phase of
your training will be the de-
velopment of a convincingly
contemptuous sneer. This will
involve constant lip-curling prac-
tice, and studying the facial ex-
pression of women immediately
after they have finished praising
a new hat worn by another
woman. The observing of the
face of a high Canberra civil
servant who finds himself put
at the same hotel table as
another Canberra civil servant
who is a grade lower is also ex-
cellent practice, or of a ‘Labor’
Minister on being offered a ride
in a car of lower social dignity
than a Buick. It goes without
saying, of course, that any cadet
who can’t develop the correct
kind of contemptuous sneer, to
be reserved especially for those
occasions when the British Em-
pire is mentioned within his
hearing, has absolutely no
chance of becoming a success-
ful protege of Dr. Evatt.
“Another phase of your train-
ing which will demand assiduous
study will be the ability, on dis-
covering that the first name of
the foreign diplomat to whom
you may be talking is Jose,
Pedro, Miguel, Arturo, Banano
or Innocent, to launch into
flowery praise of his country,
the beauty of its women, the
heroism of its men and the in-
tegrity of its Government. This
will be the preliminary to men-
tioning what a magnificent
champion of the rights of the
small nations is the Senor Dr.
Evatt and what a wonderful
President of the World Court he
would make.
“By far the most important
phase of your diplomatic educa-
tion, however, will involve rigid
physical training, particularly re-
garding contortion exercises and
the necessity to propel yourself
along without benefit of legs.
These form an absolutely essen-
tial requisite to your being ap-
pointed abroad,”
“Excuse me, sir,” piped up
one cadet, “but what will that
have to do with diplomacy?”
The instructor looked at the
interjector sternly. “Good
heavens!” he exploded. “Why,
how else will you be able to per-
form the double-somersaults,
the various twists, the crawl
to Moscow which Dr. Evatt will
require of you, and the'essential
at all times —to be able to
change your plumage in mid-
flight, even as the Doctor him-
self does?”

New States
The Tablelands and coast of northern
N.S.W. are different countries, as “W.D.”
(B. 4/8/’4B) points out, but this regional
variation alone isn’t sufficient justifica-
tion for the creation of States in each of
these districts. Even in “W.D.’s” coast,
“reaching from Murwillumbah to Kemp-
sey,” there are considerable local differ-
ences, greatest between the almost tropi-
cal Tweed and near-temperate Macleay.
In the biggest U.S. State, Texas, there are
marked divisions between the cotton-
growing, the oil-producing and the cattle-
raising areas, but no one has ever noted
any tendency of the Lone Star State to
break into three or more parts.
The problems of “flood-control, irriga-
tion and deep-sea ports” are not peculiar
to the coast, but concern both areas' —the
irrigation and deep-sea-port questions are
more vital to the inland than to the
coastal districts, which have, as a rule,
a substantial rainfall, as well as limited
port facilities,
“W.D.” says he can’t see the coasters!
“swallowing” a Tablelands city as capi-
tal. Granted a separate State on the
North Coast, can he see Grafton “swal-
lowing” Lismore as the capital, or vice
versa? Not if he knows the rivalry be-
tween these “queen cities of the north.”
Still, there isr a good case for the ulti-
mate establishment of separate States in
New England and the North Coast, as
well as any other regional district with
a large enough population. A reasonable
figure would be 200,000, Both W.A. and
Tasmania had fewer people than that
when they joined the Commonwealth. A
population of 60,000 whites will qualify
a U.S. territory for Statehood.
Such a minimum figure would not only
ensure a sufficiently strong unit but
would guard against the ever-present
danger of “Balkanisation.” Without it
there would be no limit to the number of
breakaways. The States would prob-
ably dissolve into a multitude of insig-
nificant, insolvent and squabbling district-
juntas, as happened in New Zealand be-
fore the abolition of the Provinces in
1876. Size does not greatly matter so
long as this population qualification is re-
quired. In the U.S. the 1248 square miles
of tiny Rhode Island, with its 725,000
people, means much more than the
110,000 square miles of Nevada with a
population of barely six figures.
All of those facts, however, are, rather
for future than for present consideration.
The immediate job is to break the six-
State stranglehold and establish the
seventh State, whether in northern
N.S.W., North Queensland or Riverina.
Once this is done other States will ap-
pear in due course as local desires and
differences make themselves felt.
There is no doubt, as “W.D.” remarks,
about the New-State enthusiasm. There
is a general sense that the time is now
ripe—as it was not in 1930 —for this
political move. And it would be a
national tragedy if the reformers’ keen-
ness to do everything at once killed their
chances of doing anything at all. —
K.A.S. (N.S.W.).
Farmer and Hand
Not only is the labor shortage taking
toll of the man on the land these days,
but the attitude of the workers is also
having its effect. The old friendly co-
operation between farmer and hand is
rapidly changing to silent, poorly camou-
flaged warfare. The open camaraderie
of the shearing-shed and harvest-field be-
longs back in the days when men took
pride in a good day’s work.
The employed no longer asks for what
he wants. He demands it—loudly and
with no compromise. His employer is an
enemy. If he considers the boss has put
something over him, the hand holds his
vengeance till he can even the score with
due interest. If he puts something over
the boss he’s a smart fellow.
No longer is there such a thing as
working-in to suit weather conditions, or
to help a harassed, short-staffed owner.
If the ripening crop doesn’t coincide with
the 40-hour-week it can go unharvested;
if rain falls on the sheep on the wrong day
they must go unshorn until the weather
once more observes union decrees.
On his part, the old farmer resents a
staff of inexperienced and often incom-
petent youngsters ramming their “rights”
down his throat. When his engine
coughs to a standstill, he resents the gang
sprawling in the shade reminding him
loudly of the breakdown pay they are
entitled to while he wrestles worriedly
with the worn and unprocurable part of
the engine. But, he resents it in silence.
He pays up, determined that in future
he will allow no more concessions than
the rules demand to these union-ridden
loafers.
The antagonism is growing and will
leave its mark on production. The spirit
of grab-all-and-give-little is permeating
from the city into the bush. —C. L. (Vic.).
Tax Slug
A Westralian taxpayer received his
assessment for 1946-47 on June 9, 1948,
just 10 months after he had lodged the
return. Although he had already con-
tributed, in deductions at source, more
than £6O of his salary, his assessment
showed a debit of almost £29, and he was
given to July 8 to pay. June is a tough
month for most people, with car-licence
fees, insurances and other annual charges
falling due, so the taxpayer sent a fiver to
the Taxation Department, and asked for
permission to pay the balance —about
£24—at a minimum of £2 weekly.
That was all right with the department,
subject to payment of an additional fee
of £1 45., which is roughly equivalent to
20 per cent, interest on £24 for one year.
But as it was proposed to levy it on a
debt that would have reduced itself by at
least £2 per week, to disappear completely
within three months, the interest rate
actually was considerably greater than
20 per cent.
A touch of humor was added to the
proposal by the fact that the 1946-47
assessment included an amount of
£ll 14s. for “provisional amounts in
respect of income year ending June 30,
1948.” By the time he received the assess-
ment the taxpayer had already paid in
advance by instalment deductions
approximately £5O, so that the iniquitous
interest rate was actually to be charged in
part on money that the Taxation Depart-
ment had been holding for the best part
of a year.
Needless to say, the taxpayer did not
accept the proposition. He fixed it with
a private bank for an increase of his
overdraft, and sent off a cheque in full
settlement —it was better business to pay
41 per cent, to a bank than more than
20 per cent, to the Taxation Department.
Just what would happen to a money-
lender who attempted to charge 20 per
cent, interest is interesting to contem-
plate.—Bottlebrush (W.A.).
Soldiers and Nurses
One of the real tragedies of our day is
that the old idea of compulsory military
training for the young men of Australia
has become so hopelessly entangled with
ideological theorising that it has been
abandoned, and nobody seems really
anxious to bring it back except those
“Can I help it if you re allergic to fish?”
who realise what tremendous moral as
well as military value it had.
Leaving aside the direct question of
military preparedness—though there is
nothing in the state of the world to justify
leaving it aside—the old “senior cadets,”
followed by the four years of compulsory
training, with their annual camps, their
route-marches and their “shoots,” gave
many a lad a new confidence in himself
and in life. The system contributed plenty
of first-rate soldiers to the Australian
armies, but its effects went deeper—it
helped many a youth along the road to
manhood, rough-and-ready though its
methods may have been.
There is another field in which com-
pulsion might well be considered. What
is wrong with the idea of compulsory
“Hold that expression , glamorous—you look simply WIZARD.”
nursing training for young women? Con-
sider what it would mean to Australia if
a system were introduced whereby every
girl turning, say, 18 were obliged, irrespec-
tive of class, wealth or anything but
personal invalidity, to spend six or 12
months nursing in the public hospitals of
the country.
Of course “nursing” is the wrong word
in a sense—it takes much more than six
or 12 months and much more than com-
pulsion to make a real nurse, just as it
took more than Saturday drill and an
annual camp to make a real soldier. But
hospitals would at once receive a steady
flow of young women able to handle the
routine work of wards, and at least a
number of them would be sufficiently
attracted to nursing to go on with it
voluntarily.
With routine drudgery of the wards
largely taken off their shoulders, profes-
sional nurses would be freed to carry on
the higher branches of their work. More-
over, their life would gain a new dignity
in the sense of its recognition as a posi-
tion of true community importance.
Most of the trainee-nurses would of
course return to private life —to the
typing desks, the dancing, the ushering,
the table-waiting, the leisurely living, but
all would return better equipped for their
later part in life as wives and mothers,
and with the knowledge that the world
is a place of pain and sacrifice, as well as
of sunshine and fun.
In war there would be many thousands
of volunteer-nurses ready to move to
battle-stations, and in peace there would
be fewer hospital wards closed, while
sick people wait in agony for want of the
attention which only a large recruitment
of nurses can give them. —W. D. (N.S.W.).
Leisure
Every “Red” propagandist is taught to
parrot the claim that if machines were
properly used we could get along on a
four-hour day. Nothing could be more
absurd. The man who invented the
wheel did not reduce the sum of human
labor. He stirred man’s ambition to
travel further and faster, to girdle the
earth with steel, to outsoar the eagle, to
outstrip the speed of sound, to conquer
the elements and to burden himself with
ever-increasing worldly possessions.
Increased leisure demands more
luxuries. The worker who really toiled
for six days was content to rest on the
seventh day. The machine-minder who
pushes buttons for five short days de-
mands the equivalent of a non-stop
three-ring circus to relieve the tedium of
his idle evenings and long week-ends,
with a long list of mod.-cons. and
domestic gadgets never dreamed of by
his horny-handed forefathers.
If everybody worked a four-hour day
the worker would find himself all dressed
up with nowhere to go. If the standard
of living and the tempo of life could
be stabilised at the clay-pipe and bow-
yang stage, machines on short hours
might supply bare necessities, but our
desires always outrun our abilities. If
we demand more and more modern
amenities with all the trimmings the
wheels will have to be kept turning for
longer hours, double shifts and overtime
to avoid shortages and high prices.
Our fathers were always quickly
served and well content with clay-pipes
and black-twist. Our sons stand in long
queues for “ready-rubbed” and “tailor-
mades.” — Lighter (S.A.).
Self-help
“W.P.T.” is right—so years ago the in-
habitants of a town needing a hospital
would not have wasted time appealing to
the Government (B, 28/7/’4B). They
would have built it themselves. Today,
however, such a course might not be
possible.
First, there are the necessary building
permits. The official attitude to such an
application would probably be, “The
Government builds all necessary hos-
pitals, so this one must be unnecessary.”
Having obtained the permits and actual
materials’, the next difficulty would be the
labor. Local unionists would not object,
knowing the urgent need for the hospital,
but unions are not controlled by local
members. Union bosses in the city would
soon take action to stop a few “foolish”
members building a hospital for no pay.
Having eventually completed the build-
ing and obtained a stalf, the next con-
sideration would be the attitude of the
Health Department. During the recent
floods on the north coast of N.S.W. an
emergency hospital was set up at Wood-
burn to treat flood victims. Within two
days the department had ordered it to be
closed. —T. P. V. (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
I suggested to a client of mine that if
he called at my home on Sunday I would
be able to fix up some urgent business in
which he was interested, “No fear,” he
said. “I’m working on Sunday.” (He
is a meat-wofker.) “And I get four quid
for the day’s work. But I’ll pop in and
see you on Monday morning.” “But
won’t your wages be docked?” I asked.
“No,” he said. “We’re entitled to a day
off a month on sick pay.”— Sol Brass
(Q-).
Under the Consolidated Social Services
Act a spinster (unless she be an invalid)
becomes eligible for an old-age pension
at 60. A widow, not maintaining children
under 16, is subject to the same means
test, but becomes eligible for a pension at
50. The anomaly is still more remark-
able since, to qualify as a widow within
the meaning of the Act, one may be:
simply a widow, a divorcee, a de facto
widow, a deserted wife, a woman whose
husband is an inmate of a mental hospi-
tal, or a woman whose husband is in
prison.—J. H. F. (S.A.).
An Adelaide retailer, whose slogan was
“We’re always first with the goods,’
recently opened a parcel of five rifles.
As the invoice did not come with the
goods he sold them at £3 15s. each, the
price obtaining two months earlier. The
rifles were snapped up at once. Later he
received the wholesale price and dis-
covered that, with the correct margin of
profit added, the rifles should have retailed
for £4 15s. each. He now displays a pro-
minent sign: “No Rifles, No Bullets, No
Rat-traps.” — Jen (S.A.).
The N.S.W- Farmers and Settlers
Association came out dead agains-

scheme. Condemning the notion of fixing

60 million bushels at £37 million. B
added that the plan “provides for the un-
restrained selling of wheat fdf all sorts of
purely political purposes abroad at any
price, ignoring both export parity and
the growers’ equity in his o\vn product.

The Enemy
Soon after, Canberra came under
control of the East Indies Station, with
headquarters in Ceylon, patrolling the
Maldives and as far south as Mauritius.
Then, in March, 1941, in company with
New Zealander Lcander, enemy craft
were at last sighted.
Though his targets were two merchant-
men, Captain Farncomb, remembering
Leander’s experience a few days before,
when the disguised raider Ramb 1 gave
her a broadside at close range, opened
fire at 22,000 yards, closed to 19,000
(torpedo range), then altered out again.
Canberra had catapulted her plane, yet
even with its aid in spotting fall of shot,
and both enemy ships stopped, the cruiser
loosed broadside after broadside without
scoring a hit. The Admiral of the Station
was later at Colombo to admonish the ship
for shooting away too much ammuni-
tion.
The merchantmen were now on fire and
listing, obviously scuttled, with their crews
pulling in boats for the cruiser. Ceasing
fire, Canberra slid closer, threw the boats
a line and hauled the occupants inboard.
Some were Germans, manning the
German tanker Ketty Brovig, the rest
Chinese, themselves raider prisoners
pressed into steaming the other supply-
ship, Coburg. Immediate questioning
brought the electrifying news that a few
hours before the tanker had fuelled a
German pocket-battleship, which had
then steamed northward.
Leander hove into sight from her
searching sweep as the merchantmen
settled under, and both ships immediately
opened out in a wide sweep and raced
at speed to the north, Leander out of
sight to starb’d. Their action in unhesi-
tatingly seeking a vastly superior enemy
was, like the Plate action, in accordance
with British naval tradition of closing the
enemy, regardless of odds. But one can't
help feeling how lucky Canberra was that
the Admiral Scheer doubled to the south
and was next heard of in the Atlantic —
Canberra’s ammunition was seriously de-
pleted, and there was weakness in main
armament-control efficiency.
At one stage that same afternoon the
cruiser closed-up at action, with her
plane’s report of an unidentified warship
ahead. Guns were loaded with full charge
and armor-piercing shell. But it was a
false alarm ; the “enemy” was Leander.
Canberra reverted to the Australian
Station in July, 1941, after a brief
refit, convoyed again to Singapore and
Trincomalee. She was back in Sydney
when Jap midget submarines broached
the boom in June, 1942, and a few weeks
later Rear-Admiral Crutchley, V.C., R.N.,
hoisted his flag aboard. Her commanding
officer was then Captain F. E. Getting,
R.A.N. The same month the ship pro-
ceeded to sea as part of Task Force 44
for an offensive sweep of the Coral Sea.
Her next operation was with the South
Pacific Forces, culminating in the Guadal-
canal landing on August 8, 1942. On
this night the American and Australian
nayies were deaJt one 0 f the shrewdest
M f tb _ war
blows of the war.
The Fight at Savo Island
American marines were barely estab-
lished on Guadalcanal, and unloading of
transports and supply-ships was being
rushed on the beaches. In the area north
of Savo were three American heavy
cruisers, two light cruisers and nine
destroyers. South of the island, in view
of the landing beaches, patrolled Chicago
and Canberra, screened by U.S. destroyers
Patterson and Bagley. .Cruiser Australia
was flagship of this southern force, but at
the time had been detached to can y
Admiral Crutchley to a conference aboaid
U.S.S. McCawley. In his absence Captain
H. D. Bode of Chicago was senior officer,
with Canberra the unit s guide-ship.
Canberra’s men were tired. They had
been closed-up on alm °st continuous
operations for 48 hours. Both ships
steaming flatly on a north-south hn
few miles off Savo Island, screening -
«lg operations front surface sea attack.
completely darkened, with two turret
closed-up for instant use. The rest of the
ship s company, apart from those actually
on watch, lookouts, helmsman, and so on,
were watch below.
There was no moon. Low-hanging
clouds dripped an occasional shower into
the sea, and the four-knot n.-e. breeze was
insufficient to disperse the misty ram that
shrouded Savo Island to port.
The two cruisers steamed in line-ahead
the ir beat, swung
round, returned a h>ng the same leg and
repeated the manoeuvre. The only sound
was the swish of the sea swelling wetly
down their sides and the muted whine of
.
engine-room blowers.
£ ne my in Sight

white flares ' burst into br illiant light above
the transports to s t ar b’d. At the same time
the R / T spea k er on Canberra’s bridge
cleared its tbroat w j tb a staccato crackle,
“Warning, warning, warning! Strange
sbips entering harbor!”
Destroyer Patterson had sighted them,
one Mogami-class and fine. Jintsu-
ciass light cruiser, 5000 yards ahead,
founding the tip of Savo Island,
xhe destroyer altered course to bring her
f u n broadside of guns and tubes to bear.
She opened with star-shell, and the rear
enemy cruiser replied with a salvo of eight
torpedoes. Both Japs burned their search-
lights, and with the glare of the enemy
upon her Patterson was subjected to a
crippling fire. One shell hit No. 4 gun-
shelter aft and exploded its ready-use
ammunition in a searing blast that burned
No. 3 and No. 4 guns out of action.
The little ship was zigzagging at high
speed. She slipped a torpedo on her
starb’d quarter, steadied on a parallel
course and planted a brace of shells in the
eye of the rear Jap’s searchlight. Her
next salvo started a fire amidships. The
enemy abruptly altered course.
Destroyer Bagley, on the opposite side
of our cruiser-line, now reported un-
identified ships right ahead. Then Can-
berra’s lookout made his enemy report.
Canberra Hit
Events crowded on the Australian
cruiser with paralysing suddenness. The
main gunnery-director, with turrets fol-
lowing; rasped round to the bearing of

after guns on the bearing. Before the
guns were “on" a storm ot Sin. shells

of bursting steel, then jerked out of the
water as the first torpedo hit the boiler-
With steam gone, light and power failed,
The heavy turrets dragged to a stop. Be-
fore the next broadside hit, “X” turret
fired a salvo, then fell silent. One shell
pierced the barbe'tte and jammed “A”

the barrels of “X.” The remainder
entered her thin sides, and, their fuses
started, blew her innards to a shambles.

slivers of tearing steel. The bridge caught
a salvo which wrecked its complicated
instruments and cruelly wounded Captain
Getting. Though incapacitated, he re-
fused to leave the bridge, ordering Com-
mander J. A. Walsh to take command.
The plane on its catapult burned
fiercely. Pom-pom ready-use ammunition
exploded like red-hot meteors streaking
out. A gunner formed a chain of men,
and undamaged boxes were dragged from
the magazine and thrown over the side.

Sickbay parties tended wounded from the

A torpedo-gunner’s-mate fought through

Canberra was now aflame from end

Chicago Torped
Meanwhile Chicago was preparing to
fire on Canberra’s attackers. She fired
star-shell over the Australian s bow. this
gave rise to the wholly erroneous impres-
sion that Canberra was sunk by American
forces. At no time was she struck by
friendly shells.
Chicago had no sooner opened with
star-shell than a torpedo was sighted to
starb’d. She avoided it with lull rudder
and swung into another that towered a
rampart of water over her focsle and
blew off part of her bow below he
waterline. Then a shell struck the

ated over the forrardl funnel and showered
her upperworks with shrapnel

Here the American cruisers, Q ulfl ey,
Vincennes and Astoria, were heavily
engaged. With Canberra finished and
her attackers drawing off towards the
northern battle, Chicago disengaged and
followed them at reduced speed Later
that night in that northern fight three
American cruisers were sunk. But the
consolidation of the Guadalcanal landing
had been achieved,

Crowded on destroyers, those picked
from the sea aboard trooper Barnett, her
men watched her go ; transformed in a
few hours from a proud fighting ship to
a twisted tangle of iron falling through
the dawnlit upper waters of the Pacific,
Canberra’s loss taught the Navy many
things about damage-control, fire-control,
armorplate. It revealed to Australians
the courage, the endurance, the unex-
pressed faith, the unspoken loyalty that
knit together a ship’s company.

season being winter, the South cold,
th ® Canberra Parliament in recess
al } d J* l ® North noted for the balmy d y
of July. So there burst upon us a herd
federal politicians as guests of c
Stat 9 Government, and th yve b
gallivanting about the Reef and o l
spots, and will spend the next few weeks
“investigating the remarkable potentiali-
ties of our northern areas,” or something.
“N.Q. Register,” which was at first
inclined to be amused and tolerant,
took a look at the itinerary and then lost
its patience. It noted that the main points
of interest seemed to be breweries and
beauty-spots, with an “inspection of
coral formations of the Great Barrier
Reef,” and let itself go:
For all the good North Queensland can
expect from the visit, the party might just
as well stay south of Mackay. A visit to
a brewery or a sawmill is not gaining an
insight into the undeveloped wealth of the
North. North Queenslanders had hoped
that the Federal politicians would be shown ■
sufficient areas capable of exploitation to
impress them with the need for concern
trating a greater share of developmental
projects in North Queensland; to have
brought home to them the latent wealth of
the North and the valuable contribution
this part of the nation could make to
national wealth, and to give them an insight
into conditions and problems that would
enable them to take an intelligent interest
in any matter affecting the North that might
be introduced into Federal Parliament.
Once again the North sees itself treated
with scant ceremony by the South; _ its
existence acknowledged more out of polite-
ness than out of respect for its importance.
The State Government, of course, must
take the blame for the itinerary^no doubt
it will be ready with the inevitable excuses,
but a superabundance of excuses cannot
alter the fact that the North saw the
opportunity of impressing upon Canberra
the necessity for more consideration and
development of this part of the country,
and again found itself grasping at a shadow.
It can be predicted with assurance that,
after the tour, the State Government will
point out the worthy effort it has made to
make Canberra aware of Queensland. If
its remarks are greeted with hilarity in the
North the Government has only itself to
blame

J. H. M. Abbott looks back and loi
ward :
When Phillip first saw Port Jackson in Janu-
ary, 1788, he found a beautiful land-locked lake,
where almost every part of the country behind
its coastline was densely covered with a primeval
growth of timber. Only one part of the fore-
shores of the commercial harbor today has any
resemblance to what he found when he first
sailed across its placid waters—the old military
reserve south of George’s Height's running down
to Bradley’s Head and westward to Little Sirius
Cove—but his first impression of this part of
New Holland (it didn’t become Australia until
Macquarie’s time) must have been that it was
almost' a jungle.
The first huts behind Sydney Cove were
mostly built of the trunks of the cabbage-tree
palm, but it wasn’t long before the valuable
hardwoods fuither up the harbor, particularly
in the neighborhood of the north-west arm
which subsequently became known as the Lane
Cove River, began to supply the requirements
of a more permanent sort of architecture
Though most of the timbers growing near
Sydney Cove werent of serviceable quality, in
spite of the fact that many big trees stood
on and about -the site of the new settlement it
couldn’t have been long before the pioneers
realised that, whatever else the colony might
lack, there was plenty of useful timber for
building purposes.
Nevertheless, however densely wooded the
Sydney country might have been m me first
days of white occupation, it has been estimated
that the total forest area of Australia is only
about 3.63 per cent, of the whole area ot the
Commonwealth. The original forest wealth ot
the continent can’t now be determined, but, to
take N.S.W. alone, it is supposed that forests
which now cover 11,000,000 acres have shrunk
during the last 150 years from an original area
of 30,000,000 acres. In the very earliest days
indiscriminate destruction was checked to some
extent by the reservation of all timber suitable
for naval purposes whenever a land-grant was
made. In 1795 Governor Hunter issued ordeis
against the destruction of the forests on the
Upper Hawkesbury. Trees suitable for the
navy must not be cut d9wn.
The first shipment of timber on a large scale
for use in naval dockyards was made in 1804,
but when the Napoleonic wars came to an end
the navy’s requirements became very much less.
Settlement was expanding, and thenceforward
tbe interests of forestry took a second place to
t^ose o p en i n g U p the country. Great destruc-
tion of tree-life on a large scale took place in
the early days, owing to the unregulated enter-
prise of timber-getters. Governor Brisbane told
Downing-street in 1824 that it would be of the
greatest advantage to the colony if oversea
markets could be found for Australian timbers,
though several local merchants had already dis-
covered this for themselves,
The first duty on timber-getting was imposed
i n 1827, when the Government found it neces-
S ary to make a charge of id. a foot for red-
cedar cut on Crown lands, partly to pay the
cost of keeping disorderly cedar-getters on the
coast efficiently policed. During the next 50
years the very valuable red-cedar forests were
almost completely cut out. It was the same
later on in W.A.; sandalwood belts m particular
suffered severely.
At the present time throughout the States
forestry authorities are expected to look after
the natural forests, to control the operations
of timber-getters and to provide adequate fire
protection. But we need a national awakening
to the importance of restoring our forest
resources.
