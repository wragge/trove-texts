Chinese Slaves in South Australia.
At the very time when Sir Graham Berry
and the other Iscariots of Australia are
lending their traitorous aid to an attempt to
deliver Australian Independence up to the
"aristocracy ” of "Downing-street,” a dang
which may rightly be described as terrible, me
aces not colonial prosperity alone, but thepe
sonal independence of every colonist. We ref
to the assisted immigration of Chinese in
South Australia for the purpose of construe;
ing the Pine Creek Railway and oth
Works. expression “ assisted ” is strict
correct, for not only is the poll-tax remittee
in their favour, but work is also guaranteec
to them on arrival. No more disastroi
blow to the individual liberty of Australiai
than this has ever been dealt by any Legi
lative Assembly. Urged by the prospect
a small saving in the cost of construction
the South Australian Ministry decided
sell the heritage of local labourers for
paltry mess of Mongolian pottage—th
amount of the saving thereby securec
Ancient Rome in her corrupt old age ga\
gold to the barbarians to keep them fron
plundering the city. South Australia, mor
base and cowardly still, permits the Chines
barbarian to take away from colonial work
men a share of their labour, and conse-
quently a measure of their independence, i
order that she may avoid the expenditure o
some £OO,OOO of loan money. "Austrah
for the Chinese,” is the motto of the Ministr
of South Australia.
* * »
Here it is useful to revert to the Imperia
Federation]'sts. Their excuse for pressin
on a consummation of their system is the suj
posed necessity for completing the defence t
Australia; but it is against England’s enemie
that the defence is to be made—Australia ha
no enemies of her own. Therefore the com
pletest defence against these enemies wouh
be permanently secured by separation o
Australia from England. National indepen
deuce secured, though all Europe wore a
war our shores need fear no assault, our ship
could sail in all waters, and goods be carried
safely to all ports ; as matters stand at pro
sent, England’s indulgence in hostilities wit!
any other power would render every colon'a
ship, all colonial goods, and all our towns
liable to seizure, and confiscation or
destruction. With regard to this evil,
greater than war, the Chinese invasion, Im
perial Federation would be worse than
powerless, for if Australian politics were
again subordinated to Downing-street control,
even the poll-tax now levied in the colonies
would have to be abandoned, as being op-
posed to the spirit of English treaties with
China. After separation from England, on
the contrary, a federated Australia could act
unitedly on the question ; ports could be ab-
solutely closed to the Chinese, and the whole-
sale importation of slave labour at once ami
for ever rendered impossible of achievement
by any one of the colonies. Thus we may
gather from this brief digression that Aus-
tralia’s surest defence against all foreign
enemies, including the Chinese, is to be found
in independence and federation of her colonies ;
and that the present union with England
entails continual danger of assault and inva-
sion by foreigners « a . r that would be
largely increased by the institution of any
system of Imperial Federation.
* * *
The evident evils arising from this new
departure in Australian railway construction,
appear in stronger relief when viewed in the
light of recent information concerning the
Chinese labourers. On this point the
straightly and strongly speaking North
Australian, published at Palmerston, gives
useful and reliable information. From its
recent issues we gather that Ghinsse labour
is entirely controlled by local agents who
exercise an unlimited power over the men,
keeping them in a state of virtual slavery.-
Messrs Mlllar Bros., the contractors for
Pine Creek Railway, when they required
labour called for tenders, and the agents
offered over 300 Chinese at wages ranging
from bs. 4d. to 4s. (Id. per diem, and if the
latter figure were offered asserted their
ability to supply 1000 more within a fort-
night. file immediate response to Millar
Bros’, demand proves how fierce a foe
menaces the Australian workman on his own
shores, and the extremely low wage required
proves that competition between Australian
freemen and Chines# slaves is utterly out of
the question. If the two clashes ever meet
in the labor market the Australians, despite
their 1 higher skill and greater strength,
must immediately succumb. And further,
this low rate of pay foreshadows the
efforts that will in future be made
to bring the two classes into such open
competition. The temptation to get
work done for, say 30 per cent, less than it
would cost if white men were employed,
will be too great to be resisted by capitalists;
any patriotism they may possess will not
avail to prevent the employment of these
slave-gangs wherever their labour is capable
of effecting a saving. There is no flight of
fancy or element of improbability m such
anticipation, for already the evil has been
productive of disastrous influence. While
unemployed men in thousands are demand-
ing work from the representatives of Govern-
ment in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and
Sydney, Chinese slaves and labourers con-
tinue to obtain constant employment—
scrub-cutting, dam-sinking, and ring-bark-
ing in each of the colonies. The Australians
whom they displace find much difficulty in
getting other work ; the magnetic attraction
of the capital cities draws them thither ;
they arrive in the metropolis only to find
their quest more hopeless than in the dis-
tricts whence tney came ; starvation con-
fronts them, and then they accept one of
thrs? alternatives—suicide, crime, or a com-
mission with the Unemployed. This is the
effect of the Chinese cheap labour in the
present. From its wholesale employment
under Government patronage at Pine Creek,
we are therefore warranted in the expecta-
tion that these evils will be enlarged and in-
tensified in the future.
* * *
It is not in the matter of wages alone that
Chinese labour is advantaged. There is be-
sides this the benefit which arises from a con-
centration of command ; the labour-agent
is, as far as direction of his men is concerned,
in himself, all that an Australian trade-
union attempts to be. It is for him to
decide the rate which his gangs shall receive,
and his decision is final. There is no
division of counsels similar to those which
occasionally hamper trade-unions: there are no
blacklegs ’ ’ who will accept less than the stated
rate, for Chinamen cannot singly in such
cases contract for their labour ; and there
can be no refur.nl of the men to accept the
wage decided upon by their all-powerful
agent. The Chinese labourers are like
“ dnmb driven cattle ” : their will is that of
the agent, their pay such as he 01100708 to
allow. And he seldom chooses to allow
much. In his capacity of agent, he keeps 5
per cent, of the wage earned, and then in
his business as storekeeper supplies the
workers with all that they require, deduct-
ing the amount from their pay vouchers
The North Australian calculates from
data supplied by a local agent, that suppos-
ing the labourer to work 22 whole days in a
month, at the rate of 4s. 61, for which he
should receive £4 195,, this amount will
be reduced by agent’s charges, and cost of
supplies to £1 ] Is., thus giving to each
man a net return of a fraction less than Is.
od. per diem. Ihe important consequences
which these figures involve should be
sufficient reason for their quotation hero.
They show the magnitude of the impending
danger, and the cruelty —a cruelty approach-
ing crime - of permitting the leprous pagan
to rob the Australian navvy of his heritage of
independence —bringing labour.
* * *
It must not be forgotten by Australian
electors that this employment of foreign
labour is a practical adoption of Free-trade
theories. The South Australian Govern-
ment, in preferring the labour of Chinese to
that of their own men, are simply acting
upon the Free-trade maxim that “ a nation
which wishes to become wealthy should
always buy in the cheapest market.” Al-
though this railv ay is not imported, the
labour by which it is built is so imported,
which comes to precisely the same thing in
the end. In cither case the money which it
costs goes to a foreign country, and the home
labourers are deprived of that employment
which is fheir only means of profit. In this
instance the eolony acquires wealth in fixed
capital, at a less cost than if the labour
necessary to produce that wealth were
undertaken by local men. This is a con-
spicuous advantage according to the Free-
traders’ creed, yet who will dare to justify
the action of the Government which took
Mill for its mentor in this affair ? Will Mr.
B. R. Wise, who has written a pamphlet to
pi’ove that Freti-trade beneficially effects the
wage-earner, or will Mr. Pulbforu, to whom
Protection spells national riiiil, venture to
do so ? They will not, Frce-ti'aders on this
side of the globe 111 ways forswear their
creed when put to so crucial a tOst a§ this.
John Young, Mayor of Sydney, from wHOml
perhaps it is unwise to expect any ebidfe’nce
of political intelligence; boldly declares
himself a Free-trader, yet urges the imposi-
tion of 20 per cent, ad valorem duties in
otder that colonial industries may riot be
crushed out of existence; Arid the three
Free-trade dailies of Sydney are not more
consistent; they, after vehemently denounc-
ing Protection in any shape, without excep-
tion supported the request of the ironworkers
for 10 per cent, concession in Government
contracts. Nor are these authorities
singular in their abandonment upon oc-
casion of the creed of Cobden. John
Stuart Mill and Henry George, the two
great writers on Free-trade, have each
admitted the whole matter in controversy by
declaring in their books written for the
express purpose of proving Free-trade
to be the only true national fiscal
policy, that under certain circumstances
Protection may be beneficial. With regard
to the instance under r a i w, a 1 the above-
mentione 1 authorities would certainly declare
Protection to be the preferable policy, Butthis
development of Free-trade only differs from
its every-day action in that the consequences
can be clearly traced and observed. If in
other matters it were possible to demonstrate
the effect of Free-trade with equal clearness,
there would not be one advocate of the doc
trines of Cobden within the four corners of
Australia.
* * *
It is not over-estimating the importance of
this use of Chinese slave labour in South
Australia to say that it doubles the force of
all that we have hitherto written on the
Chinese question by lending additional terrors
to the evil apprehended, and gives twofold
weight to the demand for Protection. It is
necessary that compulsion should be brought
to bear, so that the avarice of individuals
may not bar national, progress—compulsion
in the form of Protection, and compulsion by
anti-Chinese legislation are both required.
If they are not promptly obtained, the work-
men and citizens of New South Wales, who
will all ultimately suffer by the Chinese in-
vasion, if it be allowed to continue, will only
have themselves to blame for the calamity.
The danger is now near enough to make
further procrastination a crime.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“ The Voice of the Country.”
Two-thirds Orange howl, one-third Free-
trade hysteric, is about the composition of the
“voice of the country ” which in “packed” (but
not crowded) town-halls in the suburbs calls upon
the Governor of New South Wales to dissolve
Parliament. Orangeism has too far fallen in
public estimation to venture the open agitation of
its cause, and Free-trade has been too roughly
handled by its opponents and too far discredited in
the minds of electors to retain one tithe of its
wonted power: therefore any parade of the
principles supposed to govern either creed is im-
possible, and recognising this fact Orangemen and
Free-traders stand behind the hedge of indignant
patriotism and open fire upon the hated
Goteminent. Analysing the composition and
reported conduct of these meetings, reported too by
an excessively friendly press, we get some exceed-
ingly curious results. At Paddington, for instance,
a gang of Orangemen were 'let into the hall by a
side-entrance before the front doors were opened, so
there is little reason for surprise that “ Mr. J. B.
Neild, who entered late in the evening, received
a splendid reception,” This late entry, by the
way, seems to be a favorite practice of his, and
the “ splendid reception ” is always ready for him ;
whether he receives any prior intimation concern-
ing the pent-up enthusiasm or not we do not care
to inquire. .Again, at the G’ebe the master of
ceremonies and principal speaker was Mr. W. H.
L. Bailey, who runs a paper .-d'eged to be the
organ of some, presumably future, Neo-Liberal
party of which Sir Henry Parkes is to be the
leader. At Randwick, where, according to the
ITT. report, “about 100 persons” were present,
the chief orator was that reverend youth, W. S.
Frackleton, who during his two years’ experi-
ence of the colony seems to have acquired much
political information of a sort; as he was one of
the most fervid speakers at the Boyne Water cele-
bration in Sydney this year, it is not surprising
that his oration at the Randwick meeting con-
cluded with the opinion that Mr. Abigail and
Mr Neild, a couple of leading Orangemen, were
worthy of all praise. Another point which
discounts the “ voice of the country” is the un-
conscionable lies it utters on matters of detail.
It asserts, for instance, that Mr. Abbott has put
121 of his relatives into Government billets ; that
four of the Ministers and their families draw a
total of £120,000 as salary ; and that every free-
thinking man would applaud Carington if he
dissolved Parliament at once. And the same
“voice” lends itself strongly to larrikinism of a
revolutionary order. Through the bellicose
Bailey at the Glebe it calls upon electors to go in
a body to the Assembly and by sheer strength and
brute force prevent Sir Patrick Jennings and
his colleagues from entering the House ; it calls
upon all men to “rise en masse and drive this
‘brutal Ministry’ from office”; and it urges the
taxpayers not to pay a cent more until the present
Government is “ hurled from office.” Such false-
hood, malice, and venom would never be im-
ported into a just cause ; it is because the big
majority of the agitators are obliged to conceal
their real purpose and secretly acknowledge they
have no case that they are led into these excesses.
Yet the remedy they seek could only end in
the utter overthrow of their own cause. If
an appeal were now to be made to the
country, squatters, Protectionists, Romanists,
and publicans would be able to send the Jen-
nings crowd back with a triumphant ma-
jority. Orangeism and Free-trade alone would
work for Sir Henry Parkes ; and each of these
liowers has suffered immensely by the advance of
Protectionism. Orangeism is not the power it
once was. Some of its former adherents are now
ProtefctiohistS before all things ; its numbers w
been diminished, and the Frackletons who rJ 3
main cannot compensate the losses by an
vehemence. With its usual luck the |)tut

Meil in Stickram..
A cask of more significance than appears upon
the surface was recently heard in the Melbourne
District Court, Lieutenant G. C, Officer nr
her Majesty’s forces in Victoria, proceeded against
James M‘Gh,k for assault. The gallant office*
it seems, was returning on horseback, in coliinanv
with one Major Fellowbs, from a parade in
Albert Park, when mischievous M‘Ghie and some
other men drove by in a spring-cart. Shocking
to mention, the dazzling appearance of these war-
like equestrians in no way impressed the occu-
pants of the vehicle, for—complained this out-
raged officer—“ as they approached they shouted
out. and defendant made a blow with a whip at
Witness’s horse.” For this piece of horse-play Mr
M‘Ghie was lined £5. That there was nothing
very exceptional about the conduct of these lar
rikins in the spring-cart was admitted by com-
plainant. He stated that “ officers whilst in
uniform are frequently subjected to insults.”
Mark that ! In this year of grace 1886, when
Lngash Tory papers are gushing over the Soudan
Contingent and the patriotic spirit of the
colonies ; when Australian Tory papers ara
clamouring for a scheme of Imperial Federa.
tion which would assured’y involve a large
increase in the local naval and military forces
one of the glorious defenders of our unthreatened
shores complains that officers in uniform air fre-
quently subjected to insults. In the “ Last of the
Barons” Bulwer Lytton tells us that, simul-
taneously with the introduction of the art of
printing into England, the old-fashioned tourna-
ments began to excite ridicule and contempt
among the “ common people.” As their ideas ex-
panded they came to regard many time-honoured!
institutions in a new light. The spectacle of two-
men in armour lilting at one another with long
poles provoked irreverent laughter, where for-’
merly it had aroused enthusiasm. The absurd!
pomp associated with a tourney lost its charm,,,
and the principal actors were greeted with media-
val chaff by the shopkeepers and ’prentices*
who turned ..out to see the fun. Many years of
civil strife had sickened honest toilers of warlike
pageant and senseless masquerade. It began to
dawn upon them that the gallant knight was an
expensive, unproductive creature, whose greed of
“glory” was inimical to the interests of the busy
multitude which provided the sinews of war.
P our centuries have elapsed since the period of
which Lytton wrote, and during those four cen-
turies the meretricious splendour of military
display has sobered down in accordance with
the growing intelligence of the ages. Wars,
have been waged, with reason and without,
reason, but meanwhile the popular enthu-
siasm for the great game and its players has.
gradually lessened. Only gradually, for that very/
art of which Canton was one of the first teachers,,
has lent its powerful aid to throw a glamour over
the profession of arms, and so helped to hold in,
check the civilisation it has advanced. Neverthe- ’
less, the influence of Jingo journalism is not so
strong in this new country of ours, as to make a
popinjay officer an obietet of popular admiration.
The lessons of the American War of Independence
and that more recent struggle between North and
South have not been thrown away. We have
learned that men can gain glorious victories with-
out being born and bred to the business and that a
noble soldier in the time of war can make himself
a useful member of society in the time of peace.
Australia, which has now nothing to do with wars,
or rumours of wars, will be ready with her George
Washington, or Ulysses Grant, if ever the
hour demands the man. Till then we want no
military spirit,” no twopenny ha’penny parades,
no epaulettes and fal-de-rals. To the Australian
who has to work for his living a gaudy lieutenant
on horseback is a farcical sham. We regard the
ancient type of warrior with his eternal maitial
swagger, with much the same contempt that our
forefathers of Canton’s day felt for the then old
fashioned jouster. The country .has recovered
from its Soudan hysteria, but has not yet paid the
bill for the black man’s blood. A handful of self-
seeking politicians, indeed, are howling for
Imperial Federation, and the privilege of helping
England to fight her battles. To the-British Tories
who regard the howlers as interpreters of
Australian sentiment, we would point out that in
Victoria the most jingoistic of all the colonies —
officers in uniform are frequently subjected to
insults. So long as these “insults” take the
form of harmless chaff and irreverent laughter we
shall regard them as a healthy sign of the timer.
But we are sorry that the rowdy gentleman in a
spring-cart allowed his feelings to get the better
of his judgment. He is undoubtedly sorry-him-
self. Somebody’s influence was brought to bear
upon the employers of this man M’Ghie, and in
addition to a £5 fine he has got the “ sack ” from
a situation he had held for II years. We need
not add that the employers treated their old
servant with unreasonable harshness. it is
sufficient to say that the miserable Argus glorified
their conduct in a drivelling leader,

The British Navy.
li or more than 650 years—ever sin< 6
Eustace the Monk and his sanguinary crew oi
Gallic pirates were wiped out in the Channel,
England has existed solely by virtue of her navjh
and but for her navy she would probably no longer
appear on the maps as an independent nation.
On the Continent of Europe—despite the lies and
prevarication's of historians—she has lost as many
battles as she has gained, and after many a
disastrous campaign in the Netherlands of which
hardly a mention is made by the majority of
writers, an English army has been glad to put
the sea between itself and a victorious enemy, and
thus escape destruction, which would otherwise
have been its fate. The defeat of the British navy'
will mean the immediate invasion of Britain, and
the British navy is threatening to fall to pieces
through the dry-rot of corruption and villainous
jobbery, through the appointment of gilded “high
born fools to high office and the employment of
loafing royal mongrels in positions where they are
about as useful as a Chinese idol in a synagogue.
The fleet now chiefly consists of cumbersome iron
leviathans, many of which dare not put to sea;
the best ” and most expensive British ironclads
—things that cost a million pounds apiece—cannot
go four days without and are thus-


hardly fitted for a voyage out of sight of land ;
and their armaments are composed of monster
guns which the commanders are often ordered not
to fire except in the last emergency on account of
the destructive burst which would almost inevi-
tably ensue. The supply of these weapons may
be said to be a monopoly in the hands of one English
firm, and every one of the useless monsters with
which the fleet is hampered has paid enough in tips,
bribery, and grease to plate itself with gold. The
firm is a limited liability concern, and in the list
of shareholders will be found the name of almost
every man directly or indirectly connected with
the na. y. The members of the Admiralty who
order these huge cracked cylinders and pay for
them at exorbitant rates with the nation’s money
almost without exception draw dividends out of
this huge swindle ; so do a dozen Generals, and
half the officers of the Ordnance Department; so
does the Governor of Canada, who was formerly
Under-Secretary of War, and the Inspector of the
Factory, and the Superintendent of
tfle Royal Gun Factory, and the Director
;oT Ariillcry, and almost everybody down
to the Gold Stick ‘in Waiting and the
imposing flunkeys of Windsor Castle. Every one
of the rotten instruments of slaughter in which
the safety of the empire will one day depend is
passed by men all of whom know that its rottenness
would enhance their profits, and in this one depart-
ment alone enough corruption has bien revealed
to swamp the boasted British navy when the long-
expected emergency arrives, and send it down be-
low tne waves which Britannia, according to the
picturesque old lie with which we are all familiar,
is said to ru’e. Imperial Federation, should it
ever bs accomplished, only means that Australian
money will go to prop up this great Imperial
fraud ; that we will help to pay for these ships
that cannot float, and these guns that are destruc-
tive-, only to those that fire them ; and that we
vail have a partnership in the system whereby
Imperial officers with salaries of £2OO per annum
keep carriages* and send their sons to college out
of the money they make by selling their country.
The British navy—wh'cl) is visible because the
great part of it dare not leave harbour —and the
British army—which is invisible because it is
employed in a vain attempt to evict one poverty-
stricken Kerry farmer—are alike honeycombed
with corruption, fraud, incompetence, and royal
favouritism; and the best hope for the country in
the event of wiir with such a power as France is
that'the fleet may keep afloat long enough to gain
time while a real army is being created, and then
may sink where much more costly lumber lias
gone to the bottom of the deep blue sea.

Bigotry Dies Hard.
By the irony of circumstance Lord Randolph
Ciutic hill has been recently forced to take the
side of Liberalism in a controversy with the Scot-
tish Protestant Alliance, and wore it not for the
supercilious impertinence Varied only by caddish
insolence, of his letters, would make a good appear-
ance iu his new character. The appointment of a
Roman Catholic as Secretary of State is the hone
of contention. The Alliance expressed their
objection to this appointment, urging that as
Romanists acknowledge a first allegiance to the
Pope, their constant aim must be the deliverance
of England over to Popery. Lord Churchill's
replies are not worth quotation ; he had a splendid
chance of making a popular hit, but his conceit
urged him to the exhibition of his own smartness,
which is a very inferior ai-ticle indeed. All the
argument wai on his side, had he but cared to
use it, These sectarian mummies who occupy
space ,jp a world they cannot comprehend are pre-
vented by their bigotry from perceiving that the
temporal power of the churches has passed for
ever. When, as in the time of Queen Mary,
the prelates were powerful enough to order
that heresy should be considered a capital
offence, it was of much consequence what
faith a man held ; and when James 11. esteemed
a mass more highly than his crown it was also im-
portant that the king and his subjects should
kneel before the same altar. But those times hare
finally passed. Two centuries ago tho Pope was
the. most potent man in Europe. What is he now ?
A mere puppet to all but two or three Catholic
nations, and from them even he cannot obtain
obedience. Religion of all the sects was then a
life-guide, and inspiration ; modern sectarian re-
ligion is a fashionable toy to be used to while
away an hour or two on Sunday. The religion
which makes for the elevation of iiia'n is more
potent to-day than ever it has been .inUtiie course
of English history, but the religion which was
bolstered by the thumb-screw, the .rank,l and the
scavenger’s daughter passed away, with the
Stuart dynasty. It is the want of knowledge of
this fact willcii prompted Protestant Alliance
mummies to object to a Roman Catholic Secretary
of State ; it is the same wilful ignorance or bigotry
of New South Wales electors which enables politi-
cal frauds, and forgers, who wear yellow sashes on
occasion, to disgrace this colony by their ap-
pearance in the Legislative Assembly,

Is St, Jingo in England ?
English Tory journals, led by the Saturday
Hicview, have discovered that it really does not
matter to tho Empire a solitary dump
whether Russia annexes Bulgaria or not, and
that It Is quite an unimportant question whether
Turkey maintains its present insolvent indepen-
dence or falls a victim to the voracious appetite
°f the Muscovite. The Imperial policy they say
lias been so altered by recent circumstances that
England need no longer attempt to defend India
at the Balkans ; “ a little island or two in the
Mediterranean will throttle the Dardanelles and
the Bosphorus,” and, therefore, it would -he in-
advisable for English statesmen to worry about
the fate of Bulgaria. The Ministry, on the con-
trary, have, according to recent cablegrams,
decided to resurrect the skeleton of Jingoism,
and beat up a new crusade against Russia. This
variance between Tory journals and Tory states-
men is capable of an easy and sufficient explana-
tion. The latter are fresh from an electoral vic-
tory ; their party has with Unionists a strong
majority in the House. Disregarding the fact that
their triumph was won by racial jealousy and sec-
tarian bigotry, tho Tories consider that the majority
Was one of party and policy, and therefore are firm
| n the belief that foreign interference, always a
tru mp card in their play, is still beloved of the
W°ple. . The journalists of the party, on the con-
trary, are not so misled by an exultation in which
jmey participate to a lesser extent. They know
that the despised proletariat, hitherto ready to
7’espoad eagerly to the battle-call, have gained a
dim perception of the fact that foreign glory
means perpetuation of home misery; that the
enslavement of foreigners by the feats of British
drms has an indirect but strong and certain ten-
dency to add new gyves to the slaves in English
dunes and workshops ; in fine, that war is a thing
Which-brings honors to nobles, and misery, desti-
tution, disease, and death, to the “ lower classes.”
* ol 'y journalists and Tory statesmen alike promul-
gate what they deem to be a popular policy ; they
have felt the public pulse, and judge its beat with
widely different results. Who is right ? Let
Demos decide.

Slaves of the Desk.
The Civil servants of N.S.W. are now required to
devote an extra hour per diem to their official
duties, 5 p.m. being the time limiting their
labours. There is, so far as we can see, no reason
why this reform shoffld not have been made years
ago, and we utterly refuse to sympathise with the
officers deprived of an hour of their wonted
leisure. The superfine gentlemen who now adorn
the public offices find plenty of time to write
Sydney correspondence and do lots of other out-
side work, and some of them are Council
clerks and aldermen. It may be remembered,
too, that when overtime was paid for at very high
rates in the Lands and other departments, enor-
mous additions to salary were made by some of
the men who now aver that. “ it is unfair to ask
them to slave till five.’’ The work of the average
Civil servant is about the lightest and least trying
in tlie community ; it is loss arduous than (hat of
a merchant’s office, less wearisome than that of a
haberdashery store. Yet oven under the new con-
ditions the hours are shorter than in either of the
latter establishments. With lengthened hours
the number of Civil servants should certainly be
decreased, and if the decimation is done without
favouritism an immense advantage to the general
public must result.
The Old Story.
Mr. Stoddard W. G. Campbell, paying-teller
of the Bank t of Australasia, Melbourne, was so
popular and possessed of so many sterling quali-
ties, that all who knew him felt real sorrow at the
news that he was £2OOO short in his cash, and that
a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He is
“well-connected,” being a son of the much-
respected Dr. Campbell, and a .brother-in-law of
a noted Victorian Q. 0. Campbell’s numerous
friends stood by him manfully, and paid the de-
ficiency, and as it is said that were he sent to gaol
the shock Would probably kill his venerable
father, no one can much regret that the man who
is now ruined after an otherwise honorable career
of 20 years has escaped the prison-cell. But there
is another side to Campbell’s ease. Had
his father worn moleskins Instead of broadcloth,
would the offer of his friends lo refund the money-
have ensured the cancellation' of the warrant !
Most emphatically no, there would have been a
howl about “compounding a felony.” The feel-
ings of the fathers of poor people aren’t worth
consideration by the rulers of the land. Not so
very long ago in Sydney a girl who on the clearest
evidence wasshown to have been brutally outraged
was permitted to withdraw her evidence and pro-
ceed no further against her alleged violator, a man
closely related to one of our foremost citizens ;
the very same week, a woman who had been
beaten by her husband, a Redfern workman,
vainly pleaded at the police-court to bo allowed to
withdraw the charge and go home with him in
peace. The magistrates were inexorable—they
sent the brutal workman to gaol for six months.
It is the old story. The offences of'Mr. S. W. G.
Campbell, curled and scented bank official, are
atoned for by his friends —the officials have mercy
on his poor old father. But there is no official
mercy for the miserable woman who, dying of
heart-disease, tramps through the Sydney rain
and mud, madly seeking signatures for a petition
that the Governor will spare the- life of her low-
born son.

A HEiIALD reporter, who has visited some of the
Chinese furniture-shops in Sydney and the
suburbs, declares in a lengthy article that about
500 Chinese are employed in cabinet-making at an
average wage of £2 a week and hoard. But the
evidence in support of this latter conclusion
hardly boars analysis. At some shops, for in-
stance, the pay is stated to be from 20s. to £2
per week,” at another from “ 245. to 3G?.,” in
another the rate for skilled labour is quoted as
being “ 30s. per week ; ” while at one factory the
men are said to make £3 per week. It is evident,
therefore, that if there is really so wide a variance
in the rates paid at the different shops, the men
employed must be hound to the separate estab-
lishments, else they would go elsewhere to secure
better pay. The computation of “ average
rates ” must he from the data given lai-gcly
assisted by fancy. And it must not bo fox-gotten
that the men have to work i 1 hours a day, in-
cluding Sundays and holidays, to make up this
alleged average,, and that the lodging given in
with the pay is hot gorgeous, the Mongolian?,
as the Herald reporter says—
“ .Sleeping in the queerest places- under the rafters and in
odd conifers of the premises. Even in the better class of fac-
tories the sleeping rooms resembled the steerage of a ship,
with rows of bunks stretching from one side of a room to the
other, with narrow little aisles for turning."
Their board is probably akin to their lodging.
Taking one thing with another, we can hardly
credit this average pay of £2 per week. The
Herald man, who has evidently little experience
of the moon-eyed man, has got most of his infor-
mation from the Chinese themselves, and seems
not to' have been aware of the fact that they
are of all liars the most consummate. They
would swear an affidavit on the alleged circula-
tion of the Evening News.

Mayor Young’s jubilee- invoice for knives,
flowers, hooks, and assorted implements,
of grovel proves to be a large one, and
he wants the citizens of Sydney to pay it. This is
an agreeable surprise for the citizens. Even the
cups and saucers out of which the crowd of
jubilee sneaks drank their tea —and a good many
of them did drink their tea out of the saucers—
are not to be paid for out of John Young's
pocket ; neither does he mean to settle up for
that book, the “ Life of her Majesty,” which
was distributed so freely with J. Y.’s autograph
on the title page—a circumstance which led many
to think he had written it and made them chuck
the precious volume into the dust-heap ; nor does
he mean to square up for the new cushion on
which he sat, though that article has now gone
astray, and is being sat upon, we presume, by
some plebeian ; and, in short, a dozen items, from
champagne-openers down, Mr. John Young wishes
to debit to the citizens of Sydney, many of whom
were minus supper and bed on that cold
June night when the costly banquet was
being gushed over and the nominal host
was being praised for his lavishness with the
property of citizens. The great historic feed, it
appears, was not Mayor Young’s after
all. It was at least partly given by
the people, or it will be when the
accounts are dodged through the Council, which
will not he just yet. And further, partakers of
that historic feed are struck with acute anguish
on discovering that the volume which they threw
at a dog after getting home and which was picked
up in a broken-backed condition in, the yard next
morning, was deserving of a better fate, for John
Young did not write it after all. With all these
revelations coming on them in a heap, it is no
wonder the Council described the Jubilee bill as
the “ highest piece of cheek ” ou record.

Tu e Sydney Eono, when a question of
solid justice is involved, is a spectacle for the
gods. When anyone escapes hanging, that journal
wallows in woe, and when the sentence of a
criminal is commuted, the penn’orth of wailing
grief which issues from the Echo office is worth
remembering. The release of Patrick Hall who
had served only 20 months out of a 7 years’
sentence for horsestealing has again induced the
Echo to draw the plug from the sin and misery
barrel, and this is what comes out: —
“In the case of the man Patrick Hall, the principle
was distinctly affirmed that if a criminal becomes danger-
ously ill, or if there is a probability that he may lose his
reason, he shall be given his freedom. Let it be remembered
that the sole cause why this twice-convicted offender, . .
.... was set at liberty before a third of his sentence had
been completed was because he was suffering from an attack
of illness which, it was believed, might produce serious
results either to his life or his reason. , The thing is so
outrageously unjust that it is hard to believe in its reality."
Just so. But there is another side to the question,
Patrick Hall was released because, in the
opinion of the Government medical authorites, ho
was threatened with insanity through an injury
. (ohis head inflicted by a fellow-convict who en-
deavoured with partial success to smash in his
skull with an iron bar. Hall was under a
sentence of 7 years’ confinement that he might do
no harm to others during that period, and the
Government, which locked him up, was bound
also to see that no one did harm to him. The State
failed, however, in its part of the compact, and
it was afterwards decided that Patrick Hall’s
apparently, injured brain and weakened reason
might be fairly set off against the remaining 5
years of his sentence, a bargain which prima
fade was decidedly n had one for the prisoner.
It is absurd to talk as the Echo does of an “ attack
of illness,” unless that,is the Echo’s new name for
a surgical injury resulting from a murderous
assault; and if it is so we shall be happy to hit
that journal over the head any day on its own
terms. An “ attack of illness” is not a criminal
offence yet, even in New South Wales.-
The cases' of Williams v. Hall, Morgan
and party, promise to become a cause 'eelebre.
The plaintiff seems to be most determined in his
claims, and has now been granted appeal to
the Privy Council. The statement for presenta-
tion at that tribunal is being prepared by Mr.
Whitehead, solicitor of Rockhampton, who it will
be remembered introduced a new system of jump-
ing without possession, followed by bis advice
in this case. At the same time a select com-
mittee has been moved for in the Queensland
Assembly to make a full investigation into the
original applications of Gordon upon which the
whole case, now involving millions of money,- is
based.
“ Pendragon,” in The Referee, sums up
Adelaide as “ a city of magnificent distances. It
is really : The distances are much more magnifi-
cent than the cloge inspections.” He is astonished
at the number of banks in Adelaide, but does not
seem to have stayed there long enough to find out
all about the number of saints in gaol. “ Mel-
bourne,” he remarks, “is really what Adelaide
only pretends to be. Wo have no finer street in
London than Oollins-street, or rather the two
Collins-streets (East and West), and few finer
buildings. Hero again banks ride roughshod
over everything. The number of banks suggests
a system the like of which is unknown in England
Bankers are very obliging, and will do work for
their clients, the suggestion of which would out-
rage a'joint-stock manager in London.”
The English Salvationists on 4th Septem-
ber started a week of self-denial with a view to
raising the wind and wiping off the debts of the
Harmy. The results are not yet to hand, but it
is announced that the General set the example by
giving up beef and lived on pigs’ trotters during
the fast. A prominent officer “ made a rise ”by
cutting the hair of another prominent officer and
gave the fid. thus realised to the fund ; a family of
nine gave up everything they could think of, but
their thinking powers were not very extensive ;
one man denied himself an overcoat, and a square
headed Christian denied his wife a new jacket; a
foreigner gave up meat, eggs, butter, and sugar,
and Providence i ewarded him by sending another
man’s hen to lay on his premises ; and, lastly, a
nigger sent a pair of boots. There is a light and
airy pathos about that shoeless nigger,
A Grafton Chinaman, Ah Smith, complains
re surveyors who are now laying out a railway
line in his district. They go right through every-
thing. If a house stands in their road so much
the worse for the house ; and Ah Smith, not being
acquainted with the ways of a civilised. Govern-
ment, is indignant. Ho says :—“ Bimehy me
workee alongside turnip, cabbagee—one, two,
tlirec fellow come along, drivum stick along cab-
bagee. Me say, ‘ You blighted letch, whaffor
you bleakee cabbagee belongum me ? ’ Him say,

We tender our sympathy to Ah Smith.
Several mysterious robberies, in districts
where the moon-eyed Mongol predominates, sug-
gests the idea. that Chinese cheap burglary has
been introduced into Australia. The Asiatic house-
breaker does not come in at the window or the
door, like his clumsy white competitor, and he
leaves no more trace than a bird in the air. He is
simply armed with a short polo, which telescopes
out to any extent; tp this are attached a line and
hook, and by inserting the hideous combination at
an open top-story window he can gradually fish
away everything moveable. On a hot summer
night he can often make such a clearance that a
householder has to lie in bed all the next day for
want of pants, or for fear of losing his four-poster;
for John will patiently angle at a spax-e bedroom
until he reduces the furniture to a mattress. Bar-
ring a screwed-down stove there is nothing he can-
not embezzle with His telescopic fishing-rod.

torian writer, “is a growing evil in our colonial

cannot back up his charges with his name. What
more damnatory social nyctalopy than to sneak
up the back stairs of a printing office with a letter
—or a society dagger, if you like —the perfection
of antistrophe, the shade of the inimical, the
apostrophe of truth, exhibiting the bblchings of
inanition, the vulgarity of innuendo, the animus of
profanity, the teaching of apocrypha, and which
throws mud like a gutter Arab, with no principles
of lex non scripta ; entering the seat of judgment
with exsanguineous mien, via pons asinorum,
and quotes pars pro toto, and then pronounces
sentence ; but a Roman would have said of such,
‘ Pwnica fldes ne sutor ultra crcpidam.' Pardon
my trespass.” “Damnatory nyctalopy ” is good.

The Keferee
A big muster put in an appearance at
Foley’s Hall on Saturday night to witness Mr*
George Seale’s attempt to “ knock out Profes
sor McCarthy in six rounds. M‘Carthy naturally
travelled on the defensive ticket, which made the
amateur’s task more difficult. In the third round
he had the “ Professor" knocked pretty well to a
standstill, but M’Carthy’s undeniable gameness car’
ried him through, and he mutely took his punish,
ment till ordered to shake hands at the termina-
tion of the sixth round. Had M‘Carthy fought
as he generally does, making the play, the ama-
teur would have put him in his little cot for a
certainty, but M‘Carthy, who is a powerfully-
built fellow, and a “ shifty” boxer, acted
merely on the defensive when he saw
he had no show at fighting the amateur.
Another good bout was the three rounds between
the little wonder Murphy and Jack Fuller.
Giving away some two stone and a corresponding
amount of reach, Murphy gave, and Fuller
received very extensive punishment. Murphy is
certainly a clever and effective boxer, and we
believe he could travel the world over and hold
his own against all comers at the weight. The
boxer with whom Molloy sparred had no show
with the clever Victorian. Molloy is a scientific
boxer of no mean order, and when in good
“nick” he will take a lot of beating from any,
not at the top of the pugilistic tree.
* *
The so-called challenge from the old-time
boxer, of rather fighter, Alf. Jackson, to his
namesake, Peter (the champion), is a farce.
‘‘Stonewall” is old enough to be Peter Jackson’s
father, and as to fighting with skin gloves, it is
not likely the “Professor” will chance a good
business and a lengthened sojourn in Darlinghurst
out of love of obliging the old gentleman, who
is now residing in Bourke.

The Britishers have not left their form in
England. Their first match against 15 of
Adelaide proved an easy thing, Shrewsbury start-
ing the campaign with a level century.

Thirty Sydney players have been selected
to practice for the match against the Englishmen.
As many of them have not a million to one show,
they are only keeping good men out of their
practice.

At Double Bay Regatta, rowing men had
the day to themselves, as the wind was too light
to enable any of the sailing craft to finish their
races. Seale and Brett had an easy thing in the
senior double-sculls, which they won from crews
from the Sydney R.C. and Balmain R.C. The
Sydneys, as usual, were represented by a couple
of “midgets,” who, though wonderfully good at
their weight, have no show against two men of
such calibre as the Mercs, provided.

Said the Nooze in speaking of the Sydney
Driving Park Club Trotting meet“ Trotting, or
pacing, as they call it in American, is a pastime
which promises to take a good hold on the Aus-
tralian people.” The Yankees don’t call trotting
“ pacing,” the latter being a distinct and faster
gait than the trot. Maud S., the “Queen of the
Turf,” has the fastest trot record of one mile in
2min. B:|sec., made in July, 1885, whilst the crack
American pacer Johnston has covered a mile in
2min. 6,}sec.

It is not to be supposed Tom Lees will
now pay his promised visit to America to whip
Sullivan. A Yankee sporting paper gives a por-
trait with “Tom Lees” printed under it, but things
have been a bit mixed. The portrait is an excel-
lent one—of Peter Newton.

For the fifth time in nine years that
keen, straightforward, and honourable Sydney
sportsman, Hon, James White, has won the
V.R.C. Derby. All through the winter months
Trident, the chestnut son of Robinson Crusoe and
Cocoanut, has been at the head of the betting
quotations, irrespective of reports that the speedy
Victorian, Volcano, was his master. The scene
on the hill, lawn, and flat, as old Fred. Johnson
escorted Trident back to scale, almost beggars
description ; surging sections of excited humanity
were, hustling one another in all directions, shout-
ing hurrahs, and waving handkerchiefs ; and
cheers were repeated vociferously when the
anxious “all right” was pronounced by the
exacting clerk of scales. Then followed the cere-
mony of decorating the victor with the insignia at-
tached to the prize-money. This was performed
by one Harry Smith, a direct descendant of the
importer of the first donkey to Victoria. Harry
got through the ceremony faultlessly, but at all
future Derbies we hope to see this formality
entrusted to the Governor’s lady.
* * *
When Chesham rounded the turn for home
on Saturday last in the V.R.O. Derby with fully
a dozen lengths’ lead of Trident, the Hebrews
roared with delight that “ der faverite vas be ton.”
Old Semites who hobbled along, book in hand,
assisted by a stick, forgot all about their gout and
danced nimbly; Joe Thompson endeavoured to
speak to Alf. Josephs on the subject, but could
only articulate, “ A1 —A1 —Alf., he’s b —b—be —■;
no he ain’t, be G—! ” ; the fairy-like tread of
Mo-jsey could be heard on the asphalt pro-
menade as he quietly mumbled to himself, “I’ve
got a skinner! ” and the Barnard family began to
get their settling-sheets ready. But ere the
last furlong post was reached Chesham was two
lengths behind Trident, and the Chosen Race wept
bitterly. The Gentile Sabbath saw shin of beef
substituted for roast turkey.

Twenty started for the Coburg Stakes at
Flemington on Saturday. Anticipating that per-
haps one out of the score would be “stiff,” the
stewards, with that shrewdness which appears to
characterise all race-stewards, determined to spot
the sinner. But nothing came of their black-
tracker manoeuvres, although on enquiry from the
jocks, it was discovered that no less than nine of
them finished fourth.

Mr, Andrew Town has a really wonderful
brood mare in old Atholine, who has thrown dur-
ing her career at the stud, two Maribyrnong
Plate winners, one second, and one third ; and
but for an unfortunate accident the record would
this day be three firsts and one third. During the
race for the rich prize on Saturday last, Lord Car-
ington’s filly, Esperance, when leading Hunting-
tower half a length, suddenly bolted towards the
abbatoirs taking the latter with her. Mr. Cooper’s
colt lost fully ten lengths by the mishap, yet at
the finish of the spurt was only beaten half a
head, and had the winning post been two strides
further ahead, he would have won. It may be
mentioned that the first of the Darebins (Hunting-
tower) made his appearance in public in this
race, and a creditable one it was too.

A dream took us to the Melbourne Cup,
not our own dream, no, our Innocent Slumbers
being merely golden visions of angels hovering
around and whispering “ Come away”—the angels
never whisper “ good things” or “ dead snips.” We
might dream away the remainder of our existence
without getting so much as the ghost of a straight
griffin, but we had heard about the miraculous
dream which changed the peaceful current of a
N.S.W. farmer’s life. That farmer dreamt that he
was again a boy at school, an apple-cheeked urchin
with pockets full of toffee and alley-taws, in front
of him was a black-board and over that black-
board was a crimson curtain ; an unseen agency
lifted the curtain, and written upon the board in
chalk, round-hand text, was “Trenton wins
the Melbourne Cup,” We don’t know how
many times the farmer dreamed that dream,
or what he took for supper, but we do know that
he converted all his property, some £7OO worth,
into hard cash, and planked down the pieces on
Trenton. After disposing of his worldly possessions
in this unconventional way the farmer came to
Melbourne and haunted Trenton’s stable ; the
trainer even took an affectionate interest in the
man, and learned to read him as a kind of celestial
messenger bringing tidings of a great “cop.” A
dear friend of ours, perdition catch his soul,
knew the dreamer. He gave us the story with all
its alluring details. It fascinated us; the sublime
faith of this unhappy wretch who could risk his
all upon the New Zealand horse was shared by
ourselves, we determined to give half-a-sovereign a
show and take the consequences. We went to the Cup
by train, and many a true gallant spirit elected
to adopt the same means of conveyance. At first
it was our intention to take a ticket at one of the
little sentry-boxes erected under the post-office
piazzas, but the sight of an old gentleman being
hurled violently down the stone steps for trying
to anticipate his proper turn gave us pause.
We reckoned that our proper turn would come on
in about two hours’ time, so elected to secure our
brief at Spencer-street station. Even as early as
11.16 there was such a pushing and crushing and
a gnashing of teeth at that station as never was,
but we persevered, and after getting a ticket and
2s. short change we made for a doorway which
was’bcseigod by less of struggling humanity than
the others ; that was the entrance for ladies,
and gentlemen with ladies. The myrmidon
at the door challenged us. We were
equal to the emergency ; kissing our hand to two
sweet things in canary and blue looming in the
distance, we said, “ With you in a minute, dar-
lings,” and passed through. There were only 19
people in the carriage that bore us to Flemington,
and barring a scarcity of air and a painful sensa-
tion of asphyxia, the journey was exceedingly
pleasant. Arrived at the scene of action it was
evident that the attraction of a stand on the
summit of the hill had drawn off a number of
people who have patronised the grand-stand in
other years. At 12 o’clock the latter edifice was
not so closely packed but what another one or two
might have found a seat. Still if not so full as a
C.M.G. after a banquet, it was full enough.
Taking a little preliminary canter along the
terrace we were struck by the airy fairy aspect of
the ladies. White dresses predominated—not rich
white dresses —no poems in Indian muslin and
lace, but just sensible “ cut-and-come-again” cos-
tumes, which would probably be in the wash-tub
on Wednesday, and come out all fresh and smiling
for Saturday’s Steeplechase. Many of the women
in white had nailed a bit of pale-blue ribbon to the
tops of their parasols, and were sporting the
favorite’s colors on the cheap. The gubernatorial
crowd had not arrived at this time ; as we wanted
to see them badly we waited at the end of the
Terrace with a beaming heart. Standing here,
we were struck by the generally shag-bag aspect
of the carriages rolling into the members’ reserve.
The same feature of the show saddened us last
year, but on this occasion the traps were skag-
baggyer than usual. A couple of drags, indifferently
horsed, stood out in bold relief against the back-
ground of seedy buggies and barbarous barouches.
His Excellency the Governor did not drive up to
the point where we awaited him. The vice-regal
equipage came dashing along the course in a kind
of imitation “ Ascot state,” and mounted troopers
cleared the way. It was very exciting ;we rushed
across the lawn in time to see Lady Carington step
daintily down from the box seat; her boots we
observed were number two, and she wore—attend
to this ladies —a sort of fawn-coloured dust cloak,
from beneath which peeped a pearl-coloured satin
costume, with some black bows on it. Maize was
on her bonnet, and in her hand a parasol. Lady
Loch smiled approvingly from a dress of a colour
known to the sex as heliotrope. It is a
horrible colour, and we hope we may not
look upon its like again more often than
can be helped. Three minutes were devoted
to grovel when the quality alighted from
their drag. When they marched across to the
lawn to the box reserved for the salt of the earth,
one man, probably lured by the Y.R.C. authorities,
cried “ Hurrah ” in honor of Sir Henry Loch and
party, but as the popular enthusiasm was confined
to himself he dried up and seemed sorry he had
spoken. We were grieved to observe that Lord
Carington hardly looked so young and blooming
as in the old days when he was the pride and
ornament of many high-toned London resorts.
We had not previously seen his lordship since he
honored the equator by a crossing of it. It struck
us that he had come out to Australia for the sake
of his Queen and his constitution. Amid the pre-
vailing anxiety to get a glimpse of Carington the
two other governors passed unnoticed. Sir
William Robinson looked as well as eould be
expected, and the bachelor governor of Tas-
mania looked at the girls. We saw him
deliver himself of three vice-regal winks in
superior style. The Hurdle Race started the
agony, and was remarkable for the facts that the
favourite won and nothing fell over. Wo must
plead guilty to liking something to fall over, so
the race wearied us. Then there was the Rail-
way Handicap with nothing backed by the public
except Cheshara. If his Derby form meant any-
thing ;it meant that Chesham must win. Ho w-
ever, he did not. Then there was an hour and a
quarter’s interval while the lions fed. We had
brought down our little sandwich in our hat, so
we devoted a quiet half-hour to inspecting
Trenton. We found him standing like a lamb
in his clothes, decorated with a jaunty
sprig of yellow jessamine. Dream or no
dream, he is the most racing-like looking
quadruped that ever broke a backer. We
felt as confident as the other poor fellow, and
took the odds to the extent of another 10s. Theie
was time to do the lawn before the great event.
We did it. The gaudy grandeur of former days
has departed. Promonaders are fewer than they
used to was. A woman with three yards of satin
trailing behind her like a serpent in the wilder-
ness, likes to walk about: the same woman in a
short costume don’t like to walk about. Again
we say that the glory of Flcmington lawn has de-
parted, and thereby hangs a tale. Signora
Majeroni looked fetching in olive green, and Mrs.
Donald Wallace appeared heavenly in light
slate and gold horse-shoes. The horse-shoes
were embroidered on her dress. There is
nothing eke to say about the lawn except that
there were two Chinamen on it, for the first time
in the history of Victoria. The preliminary canter
for the Cup was a very tame affair. The weather
was hot, and few of the jockeys cared to put their
chargers along quicker than a tram-car. Trenton,
we particularly noticed, hardly moved out of a
walk; for good looks he took the cake of the
others. Ben Bolt, Britisher, Malua, Silvermine,
and Arsenal seemed like giving their backers a
good run for their infatuation. The start was
punctual to time. A hoarse shout from the hill 5
never so thronged as this year, a sobbing groan
from the stand, and a mixture of each from th'd
flat announced that the trouble had commenced.
Silvermine led past the stand, and Recall kept
company. Neither of Mr; White’s trio sh owed
prominently until Hexham took up the runhing about
a mile from home. Meanwhile Grace Darl-
ing and St. John were bidding the field adieu
at the wrong end. Trenton lay right off until
approaching the final turn, and then thi hope of
the dreamer commenced to thread through his
horses. Arsenal and Silvermine showed most
prominently a quarter of a mile from home, then
came Trenton gaining inch by inch; Silver-
mine knocked under to the great horse, but
Arsenal had something in hand with his bare half
length victory. There was a momentary shout of
joy as Arsenal passed the post; a few misguided
creatures mistook his colours for those of Isonomy.
When the numbers went up there was much
gloom, the general public had lost, and a good
many bookmakers had lost. The few backers who
won big sums were speechless with pleasure.
Even in the awful moment of our personal disap-
pointment we found time to drop a tear for the
farmer who saw Belshazzar-like that fatal writing
on the blackboard. He must console himself by
remembering that if Trenton had won, he
himself would certainly have gone mad; as it
is, he can commit suicide. Taking a strell
in the paddock after the Cup, we observed
that Trenton had been liberally spurred, and was
bathed in sweat. Silvermine looked passing
warm too, but Trident was not nearly so knocked
about as after his Derby victory. The disgraced
favourite had hardly turned a hair. After
moralising over the vicissitudes of turf life,
we turned our back upon the seene, and joined a
party of crest-fallen fellow-colonists in a railway-
carriage. We compared notes on our misery ;
somebody said that only the Sydney people had
won. We enquii-ed if he thought The Bulletin
had pulled off much. He gave a reassuring
answer, and wo went home feeling more com-
fo: table.

“How He Died, and Other Poems,” is
the title of the volume which Messrs. Turner and
Henderson, of Sydney, are publishing for Mr. J.
Farrell. The book, which is eagerly looked for by
Mr. Farrell’s legion of admirers will be out before
Christmas,
The “ Escaped Nun ” has been grinding
her glorified pestle and mortar at Lismore
(N.S.W.) to a jubilee of uncertiflcated lunatics,
and has got a gorgeous free “ ad.” written in gore.
The whole town has been painted red, and as a
consequence “the Loard ” has got the glory, the
escaped female has got the cash, and the deluded
Orange and Catholic fools, who assembled to fight
over this specie-devouring lady, have got the
broken heads and the bruised noses for their
share. It is hardly needful to say that the ’cute
lecturess has all the best of the bargain. For
many months she has been travelling Australia
on the ready-money stump, till people have begun
to grow weary of paying to hear her shady yarns,
and their thoughts have wandered to another
holy “escaped” individual who scooped the
Protestant pool some years ago, and then swamped
his pile by bucking against three aces and a pair
of kings ; but juit at this crisis in her fortunes
the frantic Catholics and Orangemen of Lismore
have started her in busines as a saintly martyr
and given her a new lease of prosperity. The
Romanists swore to stop the constant stream
of abuse levelled at their faith, and
a mob assembled “ with bludgeons under
their waiscoats,” according to a lynx-eyed Herald
reporter, while the bruising Protestants also
gathered to shed their blood where they had
already shed their cash. “ Heavy riding-whips,
clubs, broken palings, horse-shoes, and revolvers ”
were flourished on all sides, and a horde of un-
sexed women banded themselves together to pro-
tect their beloved nun, prepared to sink their
womanhood and fight in the streets or anywhere
else as occasion required, on her behalf. And
amid all these seething passions the escaped indi-
vidual grabbed her cash-box and held her ground.
The suggestion that she should leave the town
was met with derision. There was a lecture to bo
delivered, and there was gate-money to be raked
tn ; the wild excitement that she had aroused
ensured a good attendance, and it were better
that a score of people should be butchered
than that the lecture and the gate-money should
be sacrificed. The Protestant and Catholic clergy
of the district worked hard and ceaselessly in
their efforts to prevent bloodshed, but the woman
whose presence had roused the insensate mob to
madness declined to move her escaped anatomy
from the town, though Lismore was in a state of
siege and in all probability life depended on her
forbearance. Sensible Protestants have long ago
voted Miss O’Gorman an unspeakable nuisance,
and wish, for the sake of peace and decency, that
she were wheeling her Protestant barrow among
the saints above ; but, unluckily, so long as
Orangemen are willing to pay for her seedy
convent stories her absence is a blessing that is
past hoping for. By good fortune alone her per-
formance at Lismore has so far been unaccom-
panied by actual slaughter; it is hard to say if
such good fortune will occur again.
THE TIMARU POISONING CASE.
HALL (THE POISONER.)
MISS HOUSTON.
Thomas Hall, the Timaru (N.Z.) poisoner, is the son of a local J.P., and nephewof an Ex-Premier of
New Zealand. He is a rather good-looking fellow of about 33, and up to the time of his arrest
was quite a star of Timaru society, visiting at the most exclusive houses, and adorning the most
select circles. To him was recently married Miss Kate Cain, the charming 24-year-old daughter of
a Captain Cain, and in due time a child was born to them, Miss Margaret Houston, from the local
hospital, acting as nurse. Mrs. Hall was, however, so long in “ coming round ’ that Dr. MTntyre
became suspicious, and at last discovered that his patient was suffering from antimonial poisoning.
Hall and Miss Houston were immediately arrested. The proofs of his guilt were so strong that he
never had any hopes of acquittal, and was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life on
the 13th October, but Miss Houston was acquitted of all complicity, and a public testimonial in
her favour has been started by sympathisers. Abundant motive for the crime was discovered, for
Mrs. Hall’s life was insured for £6OOO, a sum that would have enabled him to hide a series of
forgeries with which he has since been charged. Since the proof of this attempted poison-
ing, the body of Captain Cain (the father-in-law), who died somewhat suddenly soon after the
wedding, has been raised, and the result of an examination of the stomach has been to raise Cain
against Hall, as antimony-poisoning is shown to have been the cause of death. A former partner
of Hall’s, Mr. S. H. Tate, who died under circumstances then taken as indicative of suicide, is also
to be exhumed for medical examination. The strangest part of the present case is Mrs. Hall’s re-
fusal to accept the evidence of her husband’s guilt. She still asserts his innocence, and expressed
such reluctance to appear against him that her evidence was dispensed with, and the crime
proved by means of other testimony,
A Veteran of the Press.
Mr. F. C. Brewer, sketched on another page of
this issue, stoops but little beneath the weight of
his sixty years. Born in 1826, he came to Sydney
eight years later, and after receiving such
education as his father in those years of famine
and disaster was able to bestow upon him became
an apprentice in the composing-room of the
Sydney Monitor. Since 1836 his years have been
spent in various newspaper offices, but the major
portion of his life has been devoted to the Sydney
Herald. Night-editor of that paper for fourteen
years, he has also been employed as operatic critic,
sub editor, editor of the Echo, and manager of
the Herald London office. He is still attached
to the staff of the latter paper, and seems likely
(despite a recent illness from which he has now
nearly recovered,) to wear literary harness for the
next twenty years.

The “Green Lanes of England” called
together a good house at Sydney Royal Standard
last Saturday, every kind of larrikin whom we
ever met being present, as well as a few new
animals who seemed to be fresh from the woods.
Tw® of these created a little amusement in the
dress circle, where they insisted on keeping their
felt hats on their wooden heads through the per-
formance, and when a brawny official sent the
headgear flying with a violent smack they called
him in an undertone. An
ancient baldhead, whose countenance was marked
by that speechless ferocity which characterises
the domestic hen, then took up the parable, and
we lost a whole dramatic murder in watching his
gyrations. The “Green Lanes of England,”
as we gather from the programme, is a
joint work, one of the authors having written
the ruffians in the big boots, while the other
penned the comic tailor ; as for (he remaining cha-
racters they are sloshed in anyhow. The principal
of these are Margaret Wheatstone, a gentlemanly
female in woman’s clothes ; her lover, a skunk
Tt!E.
from the briny ocean, who passes as being vir-
tuous because he is such a miserable wallowing
cur that no one gives him credit for pluck enough
to be vicious ; and Gentleman George, the ragged
Deus ex Machina of the story, who always turns
up at the right moment. This latter is a truly
noble character when he is unsobcr; he is “ related
to a Jook.” and apropos of nothing in particular,
he recites the “ Charge of the Light Brigade ” in
the voice of a gin- soaked stentor,
* * *
The plot of the drama is the same old bald
sham that we have met so often. A confiding
woman has been betrayed by the skunk from the
ocean, and his heart being as small as his gloves
are large, he leaves her for five years to bear the
burden of her secret. His father, of course, is the
TtliiWj
B^u Pi ( i °ld pachyderm who has) done duty in
00 such dramas already, and like all stage
phers of the bulgy English school he curses the
iserable broken-down girl when her sin is re-
csa, ’ ttn d casts her off. Her betrayer finds at this
l *is that he cannot redress her wrong because he
as a wife already; he had been in the habit of getting
a ed occas i°nally and had lost the run of things
ittle, but the author even yet sticks to his pur-
Th* 6 a hero out of this individual,

In * s , t * ie wrong woman who is assassinated.
Yy t 7 e third act things take a turn for the better,
e know they are coining round when we find a
chivalrous tramp musing in a winter storm, and
singing a plaintive ditty about—
“ The snow, the snow, the uggeley snow,”
Itjn Mft'/
and this tramp ultimately drags the chief sinner
to justice, and puts matters right. Nobody,
however, seems particularly grateful to him, and
so far as the drama reveals his fortunes he is left
in rags to complete his weird ballad about the
snow.
* * *
The part of Gentleman George suits Mr.
Dampier well. It is not a good character, but
it is the heft in the piece, and it was exceed-
ingly well played ; but we would ask what in the
name of the Irish Question has the “ Charge of the
Light Brigade” to do with the “Green Lanes
of England ’ ? Mr. Edmund Holloway was the
pachydermatous parent (with curse), and his
accent was awful; Mr. Stoneham was the mean
skunk from the sea, a character which he would
have made respectable if he could, but there was
no scope for anything of the kind. Mr. Leston
appeared as a dreario comic tailor who had no
mortal business in the piece ; and Messrs. Booth-
%Mi'l
man and Stark, as two roughs, looked so hideously
ruffianly that they must be set down as a success.
Lastly, Miss Dampier made a tolerable Margaret
Wheatstone. There is, of course, a good deal of
weeping in this p-rt; we have never seen Miss
Dampier in a dry character yet, and for our own
part we are getting a little tired of the “ distressed
female,” hut the pit appreciate it, and if the dis-
tressed female must be kept before the public, it
is satisfactory to see the work so well done.

Messrs. Williamson, Garner, and Mns-
grove carry their consideration for the public to a
height that may justly be considered extreme.
Knowing the discomfort that inevitably arises
from crowded houses during this hot weather,
they billed the “ Sorcerer ’ and “ Trial by Jury ”
for a fortnight, and the natural result was that
the extreme rarity of the audience in tho second
week caused a pleasant coolness to pervade the
house. “ Mascotte,” the final operatic production
of the season, is to follow on Saturday.

The Sydney Gaiety, under the auspices of
the Faust Family, is not alarmingly overpopu-
lated. And this is a matter for moderate regret,
for the present programme is variegated, and
vivacious. The least attractive item is a
“ sketch ” called “Poison.” This poison, intended
probably to kill, just fails to carry out the
intention because the audience get too much of
it, with the common result in such cases, that it
only makes them feel sick. A set-off to this
atrocity is the marble statuary which never fails
to take well and give pleasure to all. (This last a
neat little phrase evolved from our store of
originality). The microscopic Faust girls, infant
prodigies in their way, arc a feature of the show,
and perform with phenomenal cleverness. We
are not fond of infant prodigies, but our whole
heart, or at least all that is left of it, wells out
thesewards. Which is all the space the Gaiety
can have this week, for we must needs write of
autre chose,— which is French for “ other shows.”

“As You Like It,” at Sydney Opera
House,-is heralded by a dozen lites of commenda-
tory advertising, as if Shakespeare were a
liver pill, or a corn plaster, or a mixture (to be
well shook before took) which requires to be
puffed into the notice of a discriminating public.
The comedy is nightly greeted by crowded houses,
and Miss Jenyns as Rosalind has achieved another
success, though, perhaps, hardly so marked a one
as in the character of Parthenia. There is a con-
siderable lack of geography in this comedy, as in
many others which Shakespeare wrote, and it is
difficult to fix the location of Duke Frederick’s
dominions, though after a glance at this potentate
we conclude that it does not matter much
where he is quartered—any place is good enough
for him. That he is a usurper is quite evident
for his accent is either Scotch or Irish, and he is
reigning somewhere on the continent of Europe
but that is a mere detail and it does not do to be
too darned particular. He rises in the air with
a hop, like a rooster about to crow, when he
banishes Rosalind from his court, and then to our
great relief this very ordinary Duke disappears
for a time from the scene. Miss Alice
Deorwyn makes a charming Celia, though she
suffers a little from comparison with the fair
Rosalind; and Mr. W. J. Holloway, as Orlando, also
suffers from something or other. He is at his best
when whittling a club in the third act, and pasting
up affectionate handbills in the forest; he is at his
worst after the wrestling scene, when he gets
festive on the strength of his victory and sets him-
self up as a work of art for the inspection of the
Duke, who looks at him like a virtuoso examining a
cracked Queen Anne tea-pot. Mr. A. Norman, as
the other Duke, is pretty good ; Mr. Charles
Holloway makes an excellent Touchstone, and
Mr. Hodson is bald. Mr. Vernon Reid was
engaged, according to the programme, “ to Give
Due Effect to the Vocal Music,” and he does it;
and lastly, Miss Essie Jenyns, as Rosalind, makes
good amends for all shortcomings. The scenery,
according to the hand-bill, is “ magnificent,” and
we never contradict a handbill when we can help
it, for the w'retched bill always gets the last word.

spoons has again dug up its remains
from the lonely tomb and placed itself on the
boards at Sydney Academy, where it sits in state
like a dried-up bullock on a dusty plain 100 miles
from the nearest watcrholc. If this comedy were
played backwards with the middle left out and
the beginning turned upside-down it might even
now be made into a passable funeral, but no
milder measures could have any affect on it. It
is too thickly caked w r ith stupidity to be made
into a sermon without hopelessly blasting the col-
lection ; it is too incoherent to be recited in Par-
liament by a stonewalling Parkcsite and passed
off as a speech on the “ heducation hact; ” and it
can’t be used as a puff for a shin-plaster without
proving detrimental to business. We would say
more about it but we fear lest we might be be-
trayed into a just severity, so we will pause.

rhe attendance at the sixth promenade
concert in Exhibition Building on Saturday night,
though not as large as the quality of the pro-
gramme demanded, was still sufficient to warrant
the belief that Sydney people are really acquiring
a civilised taste for melody. There even seems
to be some reason to doubt whether the nigger
minstrel is now, in popular estimation, the only
true exponent of the gospel of harmony. On this
occasion Miss Cowley landed a heap more laurels
to be put with the pile she has already acquired,
and Mons. Kowalski concussed the ivories with
Kowalskian effect. Mr. Hallewell and Mr. Searl
were there, and, as usual, all there.
Minnie Palmer will probably play only a

Opera House, Auckland, about the Ist November
with “His Natural Life.” The Criterion
Theatre, Sydney, will probably open on Boxing
night with “ Falka.” The stage is 68ft broad,
and sitting accommodation is provided for 1400
persons. Mr. John Solomon is sole owner.
BRIEF MENTION.
Up to the present date, the N.S.W. rail
way Jrauderies trouble has occupied 72 days. Tha
Deluge consumed only 40, but possibly tha
evidence in that case was more conclusive.
Rev. Browne, President of the Victorian.
Congregational Union, says that dolts and fools
aren’t wanted in Parliament. True, O Browne
But they don’t go there —they go to the pulpit. I
is the rogue who goes to Parliament.
In Temora, a miner was run in for singing
a verse of “ Rule Britannia,” and charged nexi
day with drunkenness. Evidence proved con
clusively that the man was sober. Probably tho
officer thought a man must be drunk who declarer
that “ Britons never shall be slaves.”
If the Christians of Sydney can stop tear-
ing each other’s hair over a rei’edos for about five
minutes, they may be glad to learn that the Abys-
sinian Church is going to unite with the orthodox
Russian Communion. This is about the same as
if Dr. Jefferis were to unite with the Mormons,
and then the whole lot turn cannibals.
A Melbourne man suggests that the Pope
should be employed to conduct the irrigation,
works on the Murray, because if he were to damn
that river one-fourth of the people at least would,
believe it was damned, while if Deakin dammed it
and a flood came nobody would believe in his dam
at all. There seems to be some reason in this.
“ Why don’t you lay your Sydney streets
out properly?” said a S.A. Mayor, as he went
for his 72nd oyster, with just a squeeze of lemon,
during one of the recent Jubilistic socials. To
which the “Douglas” Young promptly replied:
“ Well, if our streets were as dead as yours, we’d
have ‘ laid them out ’ and buried them ten years
ago.”
According to a recent N.S.W. Parlia-
mentary paper,it was Captain Cook who discovered
Australia. We are glad to learn this fact, for we
fancied hitherto that it was Parkes, K.C.M.G.,
and that that was why he gave himself such,
confounded airs. If ’Enry did not discover
Australia we would like to know why he should
elevate the horn of worldly pride as he does.
Speaking of the reredos in St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, the Evening News says: “Every
innovation does more harm by its novelty than it
does good by its utility.” This, we reckon, is
about the most comprehensive blast on record,
for everything was an innovation once, Alfred
among the rest. Only there wasn’t much novelty
about him, and he doesn’t seem to have done any
particular good by his utility if he has any.
At Shepparton (Vic.) they don’t do things
by halves. Recently, when the C.P.S made up his
mind to depart, they subscribed not less than
£7 15s. “as a slight recognition,” &c. A banquet
followed the presentation, and the guest, noticing
the tears of his entertainers, made the question of
irrigation a prominent feature of his speech. This
little affair reminds us of a similar ceremony in
N.S.W., when the beneficiare who received £2
12s. 6d., returned thanks in an eloquent oration
which closed with a plaintive enquiry as to
whether they “ couldn’t make it three quid,”
The two great Norfolk Island pines in
Sy dney Botanic Gardens were transplanted to
their present locat ion from Government Rouse,
Parramatta, in 1817—two years after (he battle
of Waterloo.
I’he N.S.W, artillerymen are obviously
improving in their gun-practice. They can now
aim at the Pacific Ocean and yet escape hitting
the South Head lighthouse-keeper, and with a
little more experience it is expected they will be
able to hit the briny deep every time. Then the
Russian had better turn his thin end to our dogs
of war, and make himself as small a target as he
can, else he may be struck when he least expects
it. The South Head lightkeeper, by-the-bye, is
grumbling because a 141 b. shell just missed his
head. But then some men are never satisfied.
TRULY MARVELLOUS.
Cullinga, NS.W,, Sept. 24, 1886.— 1 have
suffered more or leiS with kidney and liver disease
over 25 years, and feel it my bounden duty to God
and man to testify to the value of Warner’s safe
cure and Warner’s safe pills. My urine used to
come from me six or eight times in the night, and
same during the day, especially in cold and change
able weather. I could not sleep for giddy head,
foggy signs before my eyes, a feeling like ice runn-
ing along the top of my head, great pain from the
kiuncys and on each side of my stomach, urine
full of tube casts. About fifteen months ago I be-
came so bad 1 could not void my urine, followed
by severe vomiting, lasting from 6to 25 hours. I
became a mere skeleton. I had consultation and
doctored with three different physicians, which
resulted in doing me good for a short time, and
then the disease would return worse than before.
I then sent for the fourth doctor, and I feel I can-
not do him justice in giving him too much praise
as he did his utmost to ease and cure me, and '!
feel yet I have every confidence in him. He gave
me medicine which eased me for a short time, used
his instruments, but could not get any urine from
me, as there was none in my bladder. It never
came down from the kidneys. After being twenty-
six hours without voiding urine, I was put in a
hot bath, and the urine sweat out of me, and for
six or seven months I was relieved of the urine in
this way. At the end of this time I called in
another physician, equally as good as the former.
They held a consultation together, and said I had
Bright’s disease of the kidneys very bad. They
used the instruments, but to no purpose. They
gave me medicine which afforded temporary
relief; then I became worse than ever again. At
this time I was very weak, taking so many sweat-
ing baths, and one Saturday night a mist came
before my eyes, and I went off in a faint, and
thought my last moment in this world had come.
The following Monday a friend persuaded me to
try Warner’s safe cure. One dose stopped my
vomiting, and I have not vomited since, this be-
ing over eight months ago. After the sixth
bottle of Warner’s safe cure, I passed two gravel-
stones as large as two peas joined together, and a
large quantity of smaller ones came away the same
night. The urine was thick and glassy in appear-
ance. I have taken 32 bottles Warner’s safe cure,
and four bottles Warner’s safe pills, and I feel
better than I ever did in my life. I now weigh 12
stone, and my friends say I never looked so well.
I am 51 years of age, and I earnestly recommend
Warner’s safe cure and Warner’s safe pills to all
who are afflicted with diseases of kidneys and liver.
—JAMES BuXSELL. Cootamundra,
N.S.W.—I am familiar with the case of Mr.
Box sell and vouch for the truthfulness of his testi-
monial, I am aware that he had been under
doctors for some time, who were treating him for

A LAY OK ANCIENT NEW SOUTH WALES
The Melbourne Benevolent Asylum is one
of those grand philanthropic institutions of which
this country has reason to be proud. It is con-
ducted on thoroughly practical principles. The
committee meets once a week to receive applica-
tions for admission. Poor old creatures, of both
sexes, totter into the board-room and advance
their claims. When the committee happens to be
in a merry mood it “ chaffs ” the old ’uns—asks
ladies of DO whether they can sing, and gentlemen
of 100 whether they like dancing. Just as many
as are wanted to fill the vacancies are carefully
selected. and the remainder are told to “ run in
again nest week." As they arc frequently on
crutches this reference to “ running ” makes tears
of laughter trickle down the cheeks of the unsuc-
cessful applicants when they hobble off. Con-
sidering the limited accomodation of the Benevo-
lent Asylum, it has often been a matter for sur-
prised comment that so many boarders are taken
in during the year. Some die, of course (when
two pop off in one day they are apt to get slipped
into the wrong coffins, and buried in one another’s
graves—but no matter), still the mortality rate
doesn’t keep pace with the vacancies. An ex-
planation of this phenomenon was forthcoming
last week, when William Tickle was brought be-
fore the “ Bin eh,” as a vagrant. It seems that
William, who is quite paralysed, left the Asylum
of his own accord. He had trouble enough to get
in, but after getting in William was seized with a
burning desire to get out. He states that he
would “rather go to gaol a thousand times than
return to his old quarters.” The presumption is
that the people who do remain in this very Beno-
velent Asylum are so deorepid as to he unable to
make their escape.

Brisbane is a nice place. It is not, as scorn-
ful and ignorant Southerners are prone to believe,
a vile compound of mosquitoes, mangroves, 50 o.p.
rum, and profanity ; it has all these things in
more than ample profusion, but they are miti-
gated by the influence of other less doubtful
blessings. Brisbane is a splendid place for hotel-
keepers, for the climate is an eternal bar to
teetotalism, and the public thirst is beyond
quart-measure. Yet, despite this perpetual thirst,
a clear majority of the inhabitants are usually
sober during the morning. The hay has many
peculiar advantages .except for navigation, the
adjacency of its surface to the bottom discount-
ing its value for such purposes. The river would
be a fine one if they could take it up and pull the
kinks out, and make it wider and put some water

KING KALAKAU.—ACCORDING TO AUSTRALIAN POPULAR IDEA.
“Mr. Creighton, a journalist has been appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs to the King of the
Sandwich Islands.” S.M. Herald
MINISTER CREIGHTON (loq,): “HAVING ASSUMED OFFICE, I BEG TO REQUEST
THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL INFORM ME WITH WHICH OF THE GREAT
POWERS IT IS YOUR ROYAL WISH THAT I SHOULD FIRST COMMUNICATE.”
HIS MAJESTY (decisively): “ YOU SEND LONGA KAWEEKSLAND—ME WANT
BLENTY MORE RUM.”
in. At present and always it is filled with mud,
which gets pretty thin on top, where they call it
water, and some of the residents wallow therein
unclothed. This exercise they call bathing, hut
its object is not clearly discernible. It cannot he
for pleasure, so is most probably a penance
undergone with retrospective reference to
past profanity. Brisbane could be easily de-
fended against any attack by sea. If a
hostile squadron were to approach, the easiest
way of keeping it from coming to the city would
be to send a Chinaman down with two buckets to
put the river into until the alien desperadoes had
departed. There are volunteers at Brisbane, and
sometimes they have sham-fights. They had one
lately. One army of 35 officers and 23 men con-
spired to attack the city, and about 70 other proud
patriots turned out for its defence. The invaders
landed between the patriots and the city, took two
pubs, by storm without meeting any resistance,
except when some of them suggested that it
should bo recorded on the trustful slate ; then
they marched back to the camp of the brave and
somnolent defenders, and decimated them with
fearful slaughter and blank cartridges. And
when they got full of carnage, the implacable foes
swapped chewing-tobacco, and sat down to play
ouchro till daybreak. Then they arose and
banged the inoffensive drum and squoze the
plaintive bagpipes through Queen-street at 6
o’clock in the morning until pious citizens arose
in wrath and cursed all Brisbane sham-fighters
back to the 62nd generation. Queensland
sham-fights are the genuine article, they
are all sham. Locally-grown colonial wine
is openly exposed for sale in Brisbane, but the
citizens, naturally tenacious of life, rarely commit
suicide by this moans. Business is very brisk
there just now—in the Insolvent Court, but there’s
not much doing otherwise, except in the matter of
paying fire insurance claims, Brishancitos have no
artistic sense of the beauty of a real good fire ;
when it begins to look pretty, they turn on the
hoses and spoil it right away. Sydney firemen
have a nobler perception of the picturesque ; they
fuss around until the fire has about burnt out, and
then pump on it to make a siss. But still the
Brisbane method has some advantages.

“ A representative Australian ”, now in
London wanted to find out the secret of England’s
greatness, and, after looking vainly in the Bible,
he went down to the navy-yard at Portsmouth to
see if it was there. From what he saw he thinks
he is on the right track. A boatload of timber
was being discharged when he went in, and he
stopped to find out how it was that the British fleet
absorbed £11,000,000 a year, and seemed so little
good after all. A man with a high salary was
standing looking thoughtfully around. Two men
were working a crane, another man was bossing
a rope, three men were looking at the other man,
and the man with the high salary was looking at
the whole six. On hoard the timber-vessel a man
was catching the end of a rope and passing it on
to another man, who hitched it to a piece of wood
another man looked on, and still another highly-paid
official gazed around and glared at the represen-
tative Australian. Then one man passed the word
to the other man and the other man passed it to
the boss on shore, and the latter gave it to the six
men around him, and all the six shouted to the
engineer, and he set the engine going and hauled
the log off. The whole thing looked so like a
N. S.W. railway contract that the Australian
almost thought he was at home again until he
enquired, ana found to his amazement that not
one of the crowd was nephew to a Minister.

It is not often that a money-lender gets
left, especially when he has a hook nose and his
name is “Shamuels,’ but one of the tribe has gut
left at Auckland (N.Z.) Three months ago a
well-connected new-chum of ancient pedigree was
dead-hroke in that city, and he called on
Shamuels to raise money on his furniture. The
inspection was made on a Sunday, and the husky
pershentage man, after duly explaining that
money was tight—awfully tight—lent the required
£lOO. But when the first instalment fell due the
borrower made no sign, and after giving due
notice by letter, the man with the Bible name
went to take possession—and was kicked. The
individual who had received the cheque was not
at home—in fact, he had never been at home—he
had only showed off another man’s furniture -when
the other man was absent, and as this fact
dawned on Shamuels he did a polka through
sheer agony on the door step, and screamed, “ Gif
me my moneysh. I villhaf my moneysh-” Then
he was kicked again; then he yelled that “he
would not go without his moneysh.” Then he was
kicked a third time —into the gutter.

Thomas Walker, of Maori Creek, N.Z.,
cobbler, has made a terrible mess of a suicidal job
he undertook. His ambition was to become a
halved ethereal bootmaker up above, so he cut
his throat three times, and afterwards found to
his disgust that he was still alive. Next he made
three stabs in his chest, and not having got rid of
the vital spark even then he drove the knife into
his ribs—and still he survived. Then, hardly
knowing how to blot himself out, he pul some
dynamite into a jam-pot, and stood on it while it
fizzled. As a result he nearly blew his feet off,
but yet he didn’t die. Lastly, he went fooling
round with a pistol, hut missed, though to an
ordinary observer it might seam that to hit such
a stupendous fool would he as easy -as hitting a
mountain at 10 paces ; the report also drew at-
tention, and Philip Walker is at present in the
hospital where, to his own wild surprise, he pro*
raises to recover. He now ranks as the prize ass
of N.Z., a position which was formerly held by a
lunatic who sat for half-an-hour on top of some
powder, dropping matches into it all the while
until at last the damp compound went off and
shot him into the air, scorched, frizzled, singed
and shrieking, hut still not seriously injured. ’

The wail of a tortured soul comes from
Waikaia (N.Z.). A selector residing in that breezy
dog-kennel writes to a Dunedin paper rc a recipe
for the cure of indigestion which appeared in its
agricultural columns. His letter contains about
half a column of ghastly details, and winds up by
saying that the final result was a considerable loss
in weight—the writer having gone down from ] 1
stone to six, and were it not for the hideous state
of prostration to which he is reduced he would
have come down and made the whole editorial
staff dine on the prescription. The aggrieved boss
of the Dunedin paper publishes the recipe in a
footnote. This is it:
“ Give a pint of raw linseed oil and one ounce of turuen
tine, and repeat twice a week for two weeks. Then give with
some cut feed and ground oats and corn a tablespoonfnl
twice a day of the following mixture, viz.;—Four ounces of
powdered Peruvian bark, four ounces of ground ginger, two
ounces of powdered sulphate of iron, four ounces of carbon-
ate of soda, and eight ounces of salt,”
The mistake appears to have been that the pre.
scription was meant for a horse.
AS I LAVE A-DRYNKYNGE.
(AFTER INGLODSBY.)
Written in the luncheon-reserve at Flemington.
As I laye a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge,
Merrie popped the corkes from the bottles of
champagne ;
Thprc came a maiden hrighte,
Clad in navee blue and whyte,
And that maiden she was hyghte
Ethel Jane:
As I laye a-drynkynge, a-muddleing my brvine.
As 1 laye a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge,
Ethel Jane looked sad, and she pouted prettilee;
I asked the mayden why
Stood the teare drop in her eye ?
She murmured this replye—
“ Don’t you see,
As you lye a-drynkynge you’re not a-wooing
me,”
As I laye a-drynkynge, a-drynkyngc, a-drynkynge,
Merrie popped the question from my willing
lippes;
She bent her daintic head
And her cheekes were rosy red,
As she “muzzled” me and said
’Twixt the sippes—
“ As you lye a-drynkynge, oh, have you any
tippes?”
As I laye a-drynkyngc, a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge,
Knowing was my nod as I squeezed Ethel’s
waist;
I told her of a “ cop ” —
Just a moral for a “ shop ” —
Twas the colt by Lolly pop
Out of Haste ;
But as Flay a-drynkynge, it wasn’t even placed.
As I laye a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge,
Merrie sang the blrdc as it fluttered in the air ;
A “ masher,” tall and thin,
Told ray darling what would win,
And I saw it canter in
With despair ;
As 1 lay a-drynkynge, he won her then and
there.
As I laye a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge, a-drynkynge,
Sadly sang my hearte as it sanko within my
breaste;
My little mayde was gone,
And my face was white and wan
As the downe upon the swan
’s swelling chest;
As I laye a-drynkynge my feeling were express’!,
“ Never venture, on a tippe
As you kiss a mayden’s lipps—
Let the girls and ’osses Rippe—
Give ’em best.”
By M'Glailrigan, the historian, who is believed
to have flourished about A. D. 2500.)
The member came with hasty step and anger-
furrowed brow,
And lifting high his lofty head, thus spake he
“ Cravens! now
I come mine honour to defend. Lot Barkes and
all his crew
Advance and prove by direful blo c's what Beery -
hoycando.”
Scarce had he flung the challenge forth when
Swig-the-hottle came ;
His raven locks erectile rose above his cheeks of
flame,
His ruddy nose showed clear and bright upon that
summer morn
As shines the golden cirrus-cloud beneath the
rosy dawn.
One wrathful stride he forward took, then raised
his hand on high,
And smote the boastful Bcery-hoy beneath the
dexter eye.
With one deep groan the hero fell full-length upon
the floor,
And the beery breath of Beery-hoy perfumed the
air no more.
Just then there came a partisan who viewed his
comrade’s fall,
He burned to ’venge the shameful deed and raised
his party call,
And fast the members flocking came and girt
them for the fray,
Which lasted thence till near the close of that
most famous day.
Then shone the prowess of M'Fiend, then Boozy
swept the field,
And oft the law political in utter sileiice sealed ;
Then Hodman swayed the iron fist—a fist inspiring
awe,
That e’en to legislators, proud and haughty, gave
the law.
September’s slowly-sinking sun beheld the battle
close —
Beheld the bruised and blackened eye, beheld the
battered nose.
And many a woeful cry arose and many an oath,
I ween,
As patriots thought of what they were and what
they once had been.
In those brave days, ye moderns, the whisky ran
like rain,
Our sires were men—their likes, alas ! we ne’er
shall see again ;
My story is a true one —it hath a meaning, too,
If ye cannot see the moral, ye may read it till ye
do.

Another indecent outrage. The learned

Cardinal Moran is getting himself disliked.
His Very latest is the inhibition of one of the most

The matter, it is said, has been “referred to

A little Melbourne rag, “written by old
women for old women,” is inexpressibly sorry for
“ poor Willie Campbell,” who robbed the Bank of
Australasia, and has been graciously permitted to
elude the vigilance of the law. If Willie is poor
he has only himself to blame. He collared some-
thing like £2OOO, and ought to have put the money
by. for a rainy day. But then these bank clerks
are so improvident.
There was a rush of medical men for the
post of chief examiner for the A.M.P, Society—a
comfortable appointment of £l2OO annually, lately
rendered vacant by the death of Dr. W. F.

Cox, but many of the Society’s policy-holders,
without wishing in any way to reflect upon Dr.
Cox, consider that a gross injustice has been done
to the ofilce by the non-selection of Dr. Garrett,
Dr, Mackenzie’s deputy.
Thtee Would-be suicides— a loafer, a

lyrics, but he did not mind much until the editor
bf the Northern Miner sent back a yeasty

Young Morey, who is well-connected in

In the Timaru (N.Z.) poisoning case, the
prosecution vainly sought to show that undue
familiarity had existed between “Tom” (Hall)
and “Megrims” (Miss Houston); the only point
brought out in this direction was the possibly un-
truthful evidence of one of the servants, who
stated that Miss Houston somtimes went to Mr.
Hall to get him to lace her stays for her, at which
delicate operation the gentleman appears to have
been a dab hand. Beyond that, nothing approxi-
mating to naughtiness was shown to have oc-
curred.
Judging from the tone adopted by some of
the Sydney aldermen towards the City Engineer!
One might imagine that Mr, Trevor Jones, instead
of being a man with a quarter of a century’s
honorable record, was a double-dyed villain just
convicted of robbing the dead. We don’t know
how Mr. Jones feels about it, but we’d rather be a
proscribed Anarchist’s one-eyed, three-legged,
half-starved, hydrophobiated bull-pup, than be
the servant of a body whose language was the
language of the filthy abattoirs and the brutal
pot-house.
The owners of the great Mount Morgan

That article published last Sunday must
have bitten into the very soul of Pastor Jefferis—
it is fair to presume, we suppose, that every man,
including Pastor Jefferis, has a soul. For that
godly personage to be reminded in the midst of
his flatulent blather about “Christian Socialism”
that Dr. Jefferis himself, as “ a good preacher,
is worth a large salary, which, as a remarkably
good man of business, he has increased by various
speculations, in which he has gained what other
people have lost ” —strikes us as being one of the
cruellest things on record.
VYe are sorely afraid that Field Flowers
Goe, Esq., Anglican bishop-elect of Melbourne, is
inclined to drivel. He lately said: —“Let the
Christian teacher circulate among working people
such a book as “Tim Teddingten’s Dream,” and it
will put more sense into their heads about national
politics than all the electioneering ..speeches.”
“ Tim Te( dington’s Dream” and similar volumes
of calf-headed hogwash are Bishop Goe’s idea of
the mental food appropriate for “working
people,” but if he is bringing a cargo of that so-t
of thing to Australia for the benefit of the work-
ing man, he'll be considerably astonished at the
reception his rubbish will receive.
Edmund Yates, of the World, cordially
detests the Prince of Wales, who worked hard
against him in the Lonsdale libel case—a good
turn which B.Y. has since repaid with, compound
interest added. Yates, however, is not yet satis-
fied, and he now wants to know how it is that
while distinguished servants of the British Crown
who honourably earn decorations from foreign poten-
tates, are strictly forbidden to wear them, the
British Royal Family are perpetually breaking
the law in this matter. “ The Prince, who has
never heard a gun fired in warfare, who has never
saved a life, who has never done one single thing
to qualify himself in any way for the distinction
thrust upon him, is permitted to cover his manly
bosom with eagles and lions and lambs, with
crosses and stars, until an unknowing spectator
would take him either for Marshal Mollke or the
ringmaster at the Cirque d’Ete.’

Last week, at Balmain, a person named
Albert Elkington, whosenamornay be remembered
in connection with a certain celebrated N.S.W.
Sup eme Court action a few years back, is alleged
by the daily press to have said ;—“ He had known
Mr. G. R. Dibbs—(groans)—all through his life-
time, and he was the same man in public as in pri
rate life. The man was a pauper in heart, a
pauper in thought, a pauper in soul, and a pauper
in deed.” Mr. Albert Elkington is evidently not
a pauper in at least two things—cheek and
imagination.
Mudgee Taylor, M.L.A., lifts up his voice
in the wilderness and speaks thus of the Stuart
administration :
11 The expenditure oi the N.S.W. army and navy—whose j
only conquests hitherto have been amoj the fair sex and the
Kth opian goats—was multiplied by ihree without one visible
atom of increare in its never-conspiouous efficacy.”
We beg to second Mudgee. It took several
hundred N.S.W. warriors to annex that goat, and
these warriors have since been looking round for
some new goat to conquer, and not finding one
that looked small enough to be attacked they have
been mashing housemaids instead with very slight
success. The game is not worth the caudle.
As a specimen of clerical arrogance, Bishop
Hales’ condolence with the Maoris who lost their
all by the Rotorua earthquakes takes precedence
of all former deliverances. After assuring the
sufferers that his sympathy was on tap to their
order, and noticing the fact that they have lost
all they possessed, he adds :
"It mvy te a question, however, whether means so easily
earned were really for their good; whether, in fact, we mny
not read in this visitation the interpretation of a merciful
Father who would remove from them temptations to self-
indulgence s which had Keen too strong for them.
The Arctic coolness of this latter sentence proves
how strong in consoling power is the Christian re-
ligion. It always enables the good, fat, well-paid
bishop to view with perfect equanimity the misfor-
tunes of all persons who are not subscribers to the
Stipend Fund.

It is insinuated that the appointment of
Sir William Stavvell as Lieutenant-Governor of
Victoria was intended as a personal slight to
Chief Justice Miginbotham, who is the Governor’s

advocacy of women’s rights, frightened Duncan
Gillies and his Cabinet, Duncan favoured Urn
home authorities with a glowing picture of what
might happen in the event of that radical Higin-
botham being called upon to boss Victoria pro
iem. The home authorities hearkened. So, to be
on the safe side, they appointed, as deputy ruler
of the colony, a gentleman who lately resigned
his seat upon the bench owing to mental and
bodily infirmity. The moral is easy ; Any cripple
will do to represent Royalty. But we Australians
have known that for nearly a century.
This from the Age “ Confiscating the
land is probably not possible anywhere ; but it
can hardly be dreamed of except by a half
educated or half-crazy man, in countries who <\
the possessors of the soil constitute a very lary v,
part of the population.” Heigho ! How the spii i
of the Age has changed since its chief lucl y
owner became a large landed proprietor ! Tin c
was when the slippery journal advocated land
nationalisation as the true policy for a ne v
colony. Now it argues that such a blessed cm -
summation is not to be arrived at until all tl m
land has been grabbed and the possessors of ti c
soil have become a very small part of the popula
tion. Then it will be “ possible ” for the down
trodden millions to arise in their wrath and demai d
back the land which should never have been
parted with. It is a comfortable reflection for tl e
Age that nothing of that sort can happen in Mi,
David Symc’s time.
Mr. E. Pulsford, of the N.S.W. Free-
trade Association, in trying to show that the in-
dustries of a country in which high wages rule
are not affected by competition with a low wage
country, actually has the audacity to cite the pa ■.
toral industry of Australia as proof of his argu-
ment. Mr. P. must surely know that the labou
employed in the production of wool is less tha .
that required for any other species of wealth. TL.
squatter who pays a rent of £lO,OOO a year oft .
does not pay more than £lOOO a year in wagi;.
The truth of this is so apparent as to lead bo a
suspicion of Mr. PuMord’s sincerity or sanity. I
he cannot argue from better premises than' thes
he himself must esteem his eauec lost. The wi i
argument for Free-trade will deceive no one. A> <1
it is noticeable that Free-trade has not been ab’ •
to crush this industry, as it has crushed the woolff v,
manufactures of N.S.W., simply because sa lit i
labour is employed therein. Wo wonder if IV ,
Pulsford is paid for producing these wonder! ,
arguments.

The “ Siege of Saunder’s Fort,” Woodfoi d

1811, to 6000, in 1880, and is still declining. The-*-
are not five acres of tillage to be found in five
miles, for the tenant-farmers have been swept
away, and their farms turned into pastures, tha-
the absentee landlord may make a few pound .
more per annum ; and a rental of £30,000 a year
goes to London, the owner never visiting or spend •
ing a penny on his estates. He even forbids tl *-
erection of a church on his ground, and, in shor,
all he dees is to take half the entire produce r
the land, and give nothing whatever to the stan -

seem very appropriate in such a case.
The voice of the Macleay Herald is
hoard in the wilderness regarding the alleged
perpetrators of the Mount Rennie outrage, and
this is what it says :
“They are, as we hare already said, cowards at heart, for
they belong to the larrikin fraternity. Ereryone of those
things who were implicated in the Moore Park outrage was
a larrikin—the oldest of them, the cabdrirer, being probabl
the worst specimen of humanity that ever God permitted to
attain the age of 32.”
We can only suggest in a charitable spirit that
perhaps Heaven knew what it was about when it
permitted the cabman to attain the age of 32, and
also when it didn’t—up to this date—allow the
Akgus to reach such an age by a long way, but
we quote our contemporary’s burst of eloquence to
show the admirable chance a mdn has for a fair
trial in N,S,W. The case is decided already;
hardly one Australian juryman could be found
who is not soaked with prejudice ; and it would
be necessary to change the venue to Gape Colony
on one side, or Peru on the other before the
prisoners could hope for an unbiassed hearing.
Coal-mining in Scotland seems to resemble
slavery just about as nearly as any system yet
discovered. The rate of pay for hewing varies
from Bd. to Is. 2d. per ton, and at this not more
than 2s. 6d. per day can be made —in fact, it is
stated that no miner has averaged as much as 10s.
per week during the past summer. Out of this
amount deductions for the doctor, tool-sharpening,
oil, and powder are made, and the balance, rarely
exceeding 10s., ia paid to the miner for the sup-
port of himself and family. It is not strange that
these martyrs of a cursed system grow mutinous
and threaten fearful things. But while they drag
through a miserable existence it is pleasant to
know that the lestoes of the mines continue to
make enormous profits, and are still enabled to
stimulate trade ” by the consumption of cham-
pagne and the use of sealskin and velvet. And
the landowner is equally fortunate. He receives
about 23 per cent, more for the coal naturally
placed in those seams than the miners do for hew-
ing it out, and, therefore, he. too, waxes fat and
consumes the good thing* cf the caith. How
much longer?
The Sydney E. News aspires to make
and unmake Ministers at will. Once that paper
“turned dog” on a Government which would
not give a billet as Minister for Works to a cer-
tain played-out old gentleman who happened to
be a protege of Alfred's ; yet strange to say that
Government lasted nearly three years afterwards.
The other day Sir Alexander Stuart died, and
Mr. Henniker Heaton (brother-in-law of the E.
News managing proprietor) wanted his post as
Executive Commissioner for N.S.W. Somebody
purporting to represent the News waited
upon the Colonial Secretary, demanding Mr,
Heaton’s immediate appointment to the position.
G. R. Dibhs nearly exploded with laughter at the
application, whereupon it was threatened that
the News would “round’’upon the Ministry.
“Round and be !” said G. R. D. And
strange to say the News has rounded. The
News people have vainly tried to get the newly-
imposed duty on printing paper removed, as it
means to them over £lOOO a year, and altogether
there are various exeellqjit reasons why the
Ministry should be cordially detested in Market-
street.

Society
On Tuesday afternoon, 26th ult., at
Government House, Sydney, Lord and Lady
Carington gave a garden party in honour of the
Anglican Synod. The clergy of all sorts were
strongly represented ; bishops seemed to be every-
where, and Cardinal Moran in his gorgeous robes
was also present. To the irreverent, one of the
funniest sights in the world was to see how His
Eminence stained round with his hands crossed
upon his breast, “shadowed” by four of his
clergymen. During the afternoon the Fisk
Jubilee singers gave some of their sweetest selec-
tions with very good effect, and in the intervals
the artillery band discoursed sweet music, to
which the delighted guests kept time. Lady
Carington was charming in a royal blue silk, with
old gold sash taken from the left shoulder right
across the front of the skirt, bonnet cn suite.
Many other effective costumes were shown. Mrs.
Sydney Want wore a pretty white dress and hat;
Mrs. G. B. Simpson appeared in handsome em-
broidered brown velvet ; Mrs. Henry Cohen,
stylish black dre?s, white hat : Mrs. C. Hogg,
cream crepe dress, with trimmings,
cream and black hat ; Miss Essie Jennyns wore
black and white stripes ; Mrs. Cecil Griffiths, a
neat gown of pretty grey material, bonnet to
match. Crepe dresses in every colour, stripes,
and checks, were most conspicuous.
* * *
Hon. Rupert Carington, brother of Lord
C., is expected in Sydney shortly. He intends
to spend Christmas at Government House.

Lady Martin gave a very pleasant garden
party at her residence one day last week, which

Many will deeply regret the death of Dr.
Le Gay Brereton, physician, of Sydney, a good
and large-hearted man, and a colonist of 30 years’
standing, during which he had built up for him-
self a reputation all might envy. It is as a poet
Dr. Breretoa would chiefly nave wished to be re-
membered. He wrote much delicate and scholarly
verse, often displaying great grasp of mind and
sometimes much true poetic feeling ; but his lines,
the reflex of his own gentle nature, taken all in
all lacked force and fire. He had been ill, and
had lived in retirement for years, calmly awaiting
the dmth he knew to be near at hand.

A young man belonging to a certain
“ highly respectable” Australian family (i.e., none
of his clan have, so far as is known, ever been con-
victed of anything very much worse than vio-
lently assaulting the police) lately took it into his
head to get married to a local governess, an ap-
parently simple-minded;, irl, reputedly impecunious,
whereupon his father forbade him the ancestral
mansion. [ln Scotland the ancestral mansion of
the family was an inverted boat on the banks of
the Clyde.] About a week after the marriage it
was discovered that the ci-devant governess was
entitled to £16,000 under the will of her lately-
deceased father, and that she had taken to teach-
ing merely to escape the attentions of a city
masher, who had been making her life miserable.
At latest it is reported that the old man is slowly
recovering.

Some of the “ distinguished colonists ” in
London are getting “dead-broke.” Many of them
are cabling for money, some telegraphing in a
lordly way, “'Send another £300,” and others
despatching such messages as “ Heaven’s sake,
£so—trouble.” Hundreds of men are out of work
now because the “representative Australians”
are forced to economise in this country for their
lavish use of hansoms in another, and, conse-
quently, are making one employe do the work of
two, and a few, at all events, when they come
back from Yurrup, will have little more than a
Parisian hat, a mortgage, and a distinguished
haspeot to divide among their creditors.

An anecdote of a certain remarkable
pianist, who was in Australia lately. When on
ship-board, and en route for the Land of the
Golden Fleece, he would appear upon deck, and,
plumping himself down beside an American
heiress, who was one of his comp ay non s dc voyage,
would exclaim ; “ I have had such a lovely bath
this morning,” or “ It was too cold for a bath this
morning.” In the latter event the lady would
endeavor, we presume, to get to leeward of the
genius.

The hospitable and good-natured Mrs.

passion of the brain.” The same Mrs. M., it is
stated, on the very best possible authority, i?
shortly going to have her drawing-room ceiling
“ fricasseed,” and she “ means at an early date to

Fijian society has been convulsed to its
very foundations by the death of its Albert
Edward, in the person of Ratu Joe, son of
Fhakombau, late King of Fiii. The dusky prince
was at one time in Sydney, and a pupil at Newing
ton College. At that seat of learning he was
taught all that a prince should know, and learned
a few things he might have done better without, j
It was hoped by both missionaries and loyalists
that the royal boy would get so imbued with the
influences of Christian civilisation that on his re-
turn to his native country he would give up eating I
Gospel agents, and turn from the ways of his !
fathers. It cannot be said that all these expecta- i
tions were realised. True, ho gave up missionary
pie as he found mutton more to his taste, but he
got so confused as to the relative values of rum
and true religion that he took them in equal

him in spite of the latter. It was sincerely hoped
by all good parsons that Joe would equal any
European in social refinement and culture ; but the
courtly example of our R. B. Smith, and our only
P.C., somehow lost effect as the prince found him-
self once more amidst the banana-groves and
dusky virgins of his country. We are told that
his “ lapse to savage ways caused great grief to
the friends of the Polynesian.” No doubt. It
went far to show that money cannot be worse in-
vested than in trying to civilize the body and
Christianise the soul of “ our dark brother.”

A new publication, Woman’s World, has
appeared in Melbourne. Its main object is alleged
to bo “ the encouragement of the literary talent ”
known to be smouldering in the breasts of Mel-
bourne women of all ranks and sizes. Keeping
that object strictly in view, the proprietors offer
a series of prizes on a scale fixed by women for
women. And thus it is that the outside man, for
he has no part or lot in this production, arrives at
an opinion as to what, value a woman sets on
another woman’s words. The editress asks for
the best Australian serial .lory, not to exceed
ten chapters of 3000 words each, the prize to be
£5!” This is equal to the splendid rate of half-a-
crown per column for the “best” Australian tale.
Women of Melbourne are to leave their wash-tub
and hashmaking duties, neglect their babies and
buttons, spoil pens, ink, and paper in the eager
pursuit of fame and fabulous wealth! Twenty-
five words a penny ! That is what one woman
values another woman’s words at ! Does this in-
clude the “last” word that the gentler sex so
prize? We doubt it. We fancy that word is
beyond price. Twenty-five any other words only
a penny—but nothing leas than the riches of Ind
could buy the whole total and exclusive right to
the “last word.”

Over a hundred ladies and gentlemen,
many of them well-known in Sydney “society,”
responded to the invitation of Captain T. D.
Shallard, of the R. M. S. Massilia, ,to a dance on
board, bis ship on Wednesday evening, the 27th
ult. The affair was a great success.
| The very recentmost fad in London and
American “ sassiety ” is the retention by ladies of
their maiden names after mairiage, in conjunction
with the names thrust upon them by that cero-
j mony. All ladies of money-making celebrity
I have caught on to the new idea, and some have
I S° ne better still, by squelching their married
names altogether. With an actress, or any other
lady in a public business, or profession, her name
is as much a trade-mark as the XX is on Guin-
ness stout, or the bull’s head on the Durham-
; mustard bottles, and she doesn't mean any longer
to allow her husband to infringe her patent. Even
the society lady is beginning to struggle against
j the bald-headed old custom which endorses the
absolute completeness with which the maiden dies
when the bride is born on the wedding day. Then
again, we have sympathised with Edwin Drood
when he received his first pretty invitation to tea
from the home of his soul’s adored, and couldn’t
say for certain whether the missive was written
by his fair enslaver with the azure eyes and the
golden curls, or by her fat old mamma, who had
the perplexing right to sign herself Angelina, just
as did her lonely daughter. It seems clear,
therefore, that ere long it will be the uni-
versal fashion for all married women to
pin both their surnames together by a
hyphen, even though this rule may occasionally
bring about such ludicrous compounds as Roote-
Hog, Wilde-Bull, Drinkwater-Anbuste, or such
startlers as Hunt-Emdowne, and Donker-Von
Dahm. Apropos of this, it is curious how ex-
tremes meet. The custom which is now clamour-
ing for admission into good fashionable society
has always been the established rule amongst the
Inie pea 7an try of Ireland. The peasant’s wife in
the remote districts retains her maiden name to
the last. It has as much vitality as a cat or the
irrepressible Osman Digna, and even on the morn
when a woman fastens on to her sixth husband it
1 urns up as fresh as a daisy from Daisyville. And
there is a strange but true story of how a man’s
life was saved by this custom. It was at the
Castlebar Assizes. The' man was charged with
wilful murder, and his wife, who, of course, was
legally incompetent as a witness, was the only
person whose evidence could save him. In per-
fect good faith she came up to the court, gave her
maiden name, and her evidence was duly taken
without her connection with the prisoner being
suspected by any one in the court. She proved a
conclusive alibi for her husband, who was ac-
quitted by the jury without leaving the box, and
the real wrongdoer soon afterwards turned
up and was promptly hanged.

The Victorian Militia had an exciting time
lait week, mounting guard over Carington and

Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.P., has a law-
suit on hand, and the sum of sixpence is at stake-
Henniixer hired a cab the other day in London and
drove throe miles—he says it was a little les«
while the cabby says it was a little more—foi
which he paid Is. 6d., and as he declined to hand
over tiie other sixpence he is being sued. From
this we think Henniker 11. is getting demoralised
by mixing with dukes and the like. The repre
sentativc Australian, at the beginning of his
English career, generally begins by being
rather lavish, and thinks he is apeing the manners
of the British aristocracy, till presently he f inds
that the higher classes” of Great Britain are
the meanest of skinflints, and then the colonist
also sets to work to be as mean as his soul will
allow, and he generally succeeds. But Henniker
has lots of coin, and surely he must have felt a
little ashamed when he, remembering the old.
Australian days, tendered eighteenpence to a poor
man and a hungry horse as payment for a three-
mile journey, and noted the look of weary con-
tempt which the horse cast on him as it swished
its gaunt and exhausted tail, and muttered, “Ah
another representative Australian, Two of ’em
in one day means no oats to-night.” Even a cab-
horse knows the hardened Australian now, and
sighs a horse-'sigh when it sees him enter the
vehicle. Having heard all the evidence, the de-
cision of The Bulletin is that Henniker pay the
cabman his little sixpence with £lO expenses, and
“ shout ” for the horse.

A Frisco young man, escorting a lady home
from a dance, was shot on the doorstep by the
parent, who seemed displeased with the arrange-
ment. Local papers are very indignant about the
affair. So they ought to be. It is awfully hard

cause her father happens to get angry, ’

Spofforth’s bride, we are told by the
always reliable Mr. Charles Lett, is “ Miss Gad-
man, daughter of a wealthy gentleman in the tea
trade. The young ‘ demoness ’ is said to be very
amiable, and is decidedly good-looking. She has
only one brother and a sister, so papa s wealth
has not to be very widely distributed.”

The glittering lady who doubtless thought
she would be regarded as self-sacrificing when
she gushinglyi designated Lady Carington as

this of the posiessive plural with respect
to a bride is not consonant with the customs of
polite society.

The Mordaunt case all over again ! Accord-
ing to an E. News cable, much sensation has been
caused in England by alleged disclosures in con-
nection with the “ Swagger ” case in which Lady
Colin Campbell sues for a divorce from her hus-
band, a brother of the Marquis of Lome. The
cablegram says
. 3'h ® caee was heard in Camera, and in consequence the
wildest rumours have been circulated as to the grounds for
the action and the counter-charges that have been made. It
is alleged that the Prince of Wales has been in constant com-
munication with Lady Colin Campbell, and that correspon-
dence of a very Questionable character has taken place
between the Prince and her Ladyship. The Prince of Wales
has denied the truth of the allegations. But the correspon-
dence has not been produced. This has led to an indignant
demand on the part of one section of the press for the pro-
auction of the letters. The Queen, it is said, has displayed
unusual interest in the matter, and has commanded the
Uuke of Argyle to leave no stone unturned to discover the
letters that the Prince wrote to buiy Campbell, so that her
Majesty may satisfy herself as to their contents.
The story is an old one—it has fat years past been
known that when tliis divorce case did come on,
the Prince Of Wales, an official high up in the
London Fire Brigade, and possibly one or two
other notable personages, would be selected as co-
respondents. Lady Colin is the daughter of Blood,
the noted brewer. Her husband married her
for her beauty ; she presumably married him for
his title, notwithstanding that she and her
mother were aware that he was an absolute phy-
sical wreck. As Albert Edward belongs to a
most virtuous race, and has always led an ex-
tremely virtuous life—furthermore, as he is to
Defend the Faith one day, there need be no hesi-
tation in believing his version of the story, just as
we all believed what he teld us in the Mordaunt
case. It is of course a matter of certainty that
should Bertie’s letters—his grammar Is horrid—
be discovered by the Dook, the latter will at once
hand them to the Queen, who will turn them over
to the Radical papers on the mens conscia recti
principle, just to let people see what a good boy
her Albert Edward is.

Lady Loch’s garden party at Melbourne
fast Friday passed off with eelaL Fully 2000
were present, including a large number of Sydney
people. Four Governors were amongst the
visitors. Lady Loch wore a beautiful dress of the
new purple shade, relie'’cd by touches of white
lace, small bonnet and parasol to correspond ;
Lady Carington looked charming in a well-fitting
electric blue silk gown, with old gold sash placed
over bodice and skirt, a pretty bonnet to match.
Hundreds of white dresses of every make and
fashion were displayed ; also a very large number
of the crepe material. Cotton frocks were in the
ascendant.

H.M.S. Nelson s. to be recalled ‘ ‘ because
she is regarded as too large to be docked on the
Australian station.” It has seemingly taken the
Admiralty a good many years to find out that fact.
Sydney Evening News is loose in bio-
graphy. A day or two ago it said, “ Sir Arthur
Guinness has sold his brewery to a company for
£6,000,000. Is he to be made a peer, too? ” Un-
happily for the success of this paragraph with the
small joke attached, Sir Arthur has no brewery,
and he a peer already. He had the brewery
once, but he sold it to his brother for £1,000,600 in
gold,, and the Queen was so staggered when she
heard of the transaction that she at once called
the owner of all this coin to the Upper House as
Baron Ardilaun. The baronetcy, which was the
first step to rank, was gained by Arthur’s fattier,
who at a cost of £150,000 restored St, Patrick’s
Cathedral, Dublin, and built some large schools
for the poor, and it is recorded that an American
visitor once stood on a commanding point where
the church, the schools, and the brewery were all
visible together, and, overawed by their magnifi-
cence, hi declared that Guinness was the only
man he knew “who ran salvation, education, and
damnation all at once.” It is worth noting, too,
that education and salvation together only made
Guinness a baronet; it was the other thing that
made him a peer.

On Thursday last H.M.S. Miranda left Sydney on her
return voyage for England.
Miss Pedley has issued invitations for an At Home to be
held in the Y.M.C.A. Hall, Pitt-street, on Saturday, Nov. 6.
On Wednesday evening, 27th ult., the first social in con-

at Needs’ rooms.
Mr. Purves, Q.C. (Vic.), gave Mr. Attorney-General Want
a dinner at the Melbourne Athenvoum Club last week. The
bar was fully represented.
Sydney Baseball Clubs gave a social at Needs’ Booms on
the 27th ult. It was in every way a success. Mr. G. F.
Stuart, U.S., and Mr. J. B. Laing were the Ms 0. , •
“LaSocieta del Buon Amore” held their third annual
ball at Leigh House, Sydney, on the 26th ult. Decorations,
company, the dresses, and supper were all en suite. Dancing
was reluctantly abandoned at daylight.
A cake and flower show, organised by Mrs. Thomas Mort,
. was held at Greenoaks, Darling Point, on Wednesday after-
noon, the 27th ult. The proceeds, which amounted to over
a£50, are to be devoted to the Melanesian Mission.
Surprise parties are the fashion just now, and the other
' night the members of the Botany Social Club surprised Mr.
and Mrs. John Walsh at their residence, Bunnerong, Botany.
The visitors took their own supper and spent a very pleasant
evening, dancing and singing until a late hour. ■
Parramatta, not to be behind the age, has a Dramatic
" Club, and last week they played “ London Assurance," in the
, Victoria Theatre, to the intense delight of their friends and
enemies. The local critic describes the acting as “perfect,"
but as no one has described the critic we are unable to statv
' the exact value of his opinion. After the performance the
actors and audience adjourned to the Masonic Hall, and
with the aid of the Cumberland Band danced off some of the
effects of Parramatta Assurance.
The Primate and Mrs. Bany issued invitations for a garden
irty to be held at Bishopsoourt on Saturday afternoon, the
31th, but unfortunately Mrs. Barry was too ill to appear,
and the Bishop had to receive the guests alone. The clergy,
with their families, were well represented. The weather
was most favourable, with the exception of a small shower
of rain which came on about 4 o’clock, and rather alarmed
the wearers of smart frocks. However, it soon passed over,
and the visitors returned to their homes in comfort. The
party terminated about 6 o’clock
■ Stepfathers and guardians of orphan
Sydney Lancers are hereby informed that, accord-
ing to last week’s cablegram, there is a favourable
opening for these heroes in the island of Skye
(Scotland), where a good deal of hard fighting is
going on. In Skye, as in Ireland, the curse of
middlemen and agents, rack-rents, evictions, ab-
senteeism, and all the rest of the dreary round of
Tory tyranny has been going on for years, till at
last the people have risen in real earnest, and the
royal father-in-law who owns the territory is left
at a discount. The people of the island are a war-
like crowd, and hard to subdue. During the
Peninsular war Skye contributed 19 generals and,
it is said, 45,000 men—a greater number than now
inhabit-the district—to the British Army. The
country was depopulated that the people might
fight the battles of England, and now the power
of England is being exerted to crush the last
remnant of this gallant race. The guirilla war
which is now going on, however, is damaging to
the uniform and the nose of the British military
swell. Stones, sticks and turnips are the weapons em-
ployed, and many a red-coated dude has been
surprised to hear a sudden squash and a thud,
and has afterwards discovered that it was caused
by him striking the ground with a brick on top of
him. Evictions have been mostly stopped and
rents suspended, the British army not being large
enough to do all the bailiff duty required of it,
hut still every now and then a widow is turned
out of her thatched cottage hy means of a surprise
and a forced march of Her Majesty’s troops, who
then raise cheers in honour of their own bravery
The result of the movement is still doubtful, hut
similar insurrections are threatening in a dozen
different parts ’ of Scotland, and in Ross-shire, the
Marquis of Stafford has been beaten at the poll by
a crofter who now sits in the House of Commons
—an upheaval which in the opinion of the average
Tory is more ominous than a dozen risings like
that of Skye.
“Does Sir Patrick Jennings work very
hard in his office 2 ” asked a N.Z. man the other
day. “Yes, indeed,” was the reply, “it takes
him eight hours’ hard work every day to make up
his own mind.”

bourne Herald “ A Christian Gentleman with

A Melbourne boy, William Fitzdamme,
has been throwing stones at an old gentleman

“ A London expert says that the tobacco
exhibited by N.S.W. in the Coloneries is strong
and rank.” This gives The Bulletin an oppor-
tunity of remarking that it is almost absolutely
impossible to obtain in London a pipe-full of tobacco
which an Australian bushman would think worth
smoking. The Englishman smokes “ birds eye,”
a horrid mixture composed apparently of chopped-
up lucerne, monkeys eyebrows, and cigar-stumps.
There are not a dozen shops in London where you
can buy American cake tobacco, and when you do
encounter real Virginian you find each individual
bit of it wrapped up in a separate duty-stamp,
which, of course, utterly spoils the weed. The
price demanded is extortionate—alleged Barrett’s
twist, for instance, costs about 14s. per lb. at any
of the tobacco-shops in the West End. 7he corn-
stalk who visits England will find it worth his
while to carry with him some good American
tobacco and pay the duty thereon, as it takes a
civilised Australian about eighteen months to get
used to the dog-hair and cow-tail mixtures sold by
the noble London tradesman at fourpcnc-e-halfpcnny
an ounce.

Grown tall and bright, and golden in the sun.
A fair young woman is the other one,
Which ends the trio of my graces sweet
That with the full-rigged vessel was begun.”

When tree" in Spring
Are blossoming,
My lady wakes
From dreams whose light
Made dark days bright,
For their sweet sakes.
Yet in her eyes
A shadow lies,
Of bygone mirth ;
And still she seems
To walk in dreams,
And not on earth.
Some men may hold
That hair of gold
Is lovelier
Than darker sheen :
They have not seen
My lady’s hair.
Her eyes are bright,
Her bosom white
As the sea-foam
On sharp rocks sprayed ;
Her mouth is made
Of honeycomb.
And whoso seeks
In’ her dusk cheeks
May see love’s sign,
A blush that glows
Like a red rose
Beneath brown wine.

But these on the sun-kissed flood
Of the corn that rolls breast-deop
Burn redder than drops of blood
On a dead king’s golden mail.
Heart’s dearest, I would that we
These blooms of forgetfulness
Might bind on our brows and steep
Our love in Lethe ere less
Grow its flames with thee or me.
When Time with his evil eye
The beautiful Love has slain,
There is nought to gain or keep
Thereafter and all is vain—
Should we wait to see Love die ?

We have reaped : ’tis time to rest.
Why should we wake hut to weep 2

who, having been in London for some years, should
know a little about the matter, openly opposes
“ Wales’ ” idea that the colonial Agencies-General
should be shifted from Victoria-street, West-
minster, to the proposed Imperial Jubilee Insti-
tute at South Kensington. Graham Berry, as
might have been expected, is on the Prince’s side,
and, as might also have been anticipated, “the
general consensus of opinion was in the direction
of executing the wishes of the Prirce.”
A yarn from North Queensland ;
Mac——, who owns a station on the lower Flin-
ders, is not a good bushman, and approaching the
head-station one night about 9 p.m. he entered »
clump of gidya timber some quarter of a mile
square, in which he circled till 3 a.m.—“ ringing ’
in his own tracks —when he emerged at his own
verandah. In the morning, conversing at brcal -
fast with his manager about some fencing proposed
to be done, he remarked, “ Talk about no timber
on the run—miles o’ gory gidya—miles o’ gory
gidya—riding thro’ it six ruddy hours last night—
My word ! ”
David Buchanan, who has just now nothing
to do but write to the English newspapers, pro
tests in the Times against bung charged incomi -
tax while he is only a visitor in England. This
little income-tax affair will serve as an admirable
corrective to the flatulent “loyalty ” of the
“ colonial gang,” who, if they had nothing to
grumble at, might absolutely burst with Im-
perialism. David is i roverbially cautious about
the bawbees, and if (he Income-tax Commis-
sioners insist upon di agging out his saxpein es
wshall soon have him back in Australia in his
old barristerial role of saviour of the gentle cattk-
duffer and the enten rising horse-thic f.
The Singleton (N.S.W.) assault case is
another nasty jar to the Sydney Press. When
first announced the “ outrage ” consisted of equal
parts of maidenly modesty and “lair kin
brutality,” but the evidenee discloses a veiy cif
ferent story. The prosecutrix is sworn to have
been addicted to drink. She owned that her code of
morality had not been a very strict one, and it
was further proved that she had been fined fer in-
decent exposure. These circumstances have a
tendency to lower her down from the lofty
pedestal on which she was placed hy our gushing
contemps. There is, after all, nothing whatevi r
in this case to disprove the assertion thatavirtuous
and modest girl is as safe in N.S.W. as in any other
part of the world.
A curious human monstrosily has come to
light in France in the person of a Provencal of
thirty, named Simeon Aiguier, who, thanks to
his peculiar system of muscles and nerves, can
transform himself in most wondrous fashion. At
one moment, assuming the rigidity of a statue,
his body may be struck sharply, the blows falling
as on a block of stone. At another he moves his
stomach from above and below and from right
to left into the form of a football, and projects it
forwards, which gives him the appearance of a
colossally stout personage. Ho then withdraws it
into the thorax opening like a cage, and the hollow
look of his body immediately reminds one of a
skeleton. Aiguier successfully imitates a man
subjected to the tortures of the rack, as also a
man hanging himself, and assumes a strikingly
cadaveric look. What most astonished the doctors
was the stoppage of the blood, now on the left and
now on the right side, which was effected hy
muscular contraction.
Well-known in North Queensland is Louis
Severin, the present Mayor of Cairns. At one
time Louis resided in Cooktown. He lived near
the bank of a small creek at the front of the
town. One day he got a live turtle from some
beche-de-mer fishers and chained him up in the
hack yard with chain enough to allow him to go
into the water. And the following night was the
full moon, and Louis, who is a Frenchman, was
seated in his wigwam about 9 o’clock, meditating
over various mundane matters, when he was
roused from his reverie by a tremendous discharge
of musketry at the rear. Louis rushed out
brandishing an old sword used hy one of his
ancestors at the capture of the Bastille, and found
all the Cooktown police force and a battalion of
citizens platoon-firing at the turtle, under the
belief that it was a crocodile of gigantic dimen-
sions. The turtle was in the water rising and
sinking alternately, and every time his back showed
on the surface it was saluted by a wild fusillade
from all points of the compass. Then Louis lilted
up his voice and expressed his opinions in four
languages, all of them unfit for publication and
the police and the citizen guerillas sneaked away
to the nearest hotels, and the turtle crawled out
on the shore without a scratch on him and wonj
dered what in thunder it was all about. •

THE VERDICT OF TRUTH.
Fair Truth, who lives—so the legends say—
At the bottom of a well,
Came to the surface the other day
To search for facts as a goddess may,
When she has a doubt to quell.
She’d read all the advertising lore,
Touching diff rent kinds of beer,
And knew that some of the traders swore
And looked and felt uncommonly sore,
About one they’d cause to fear.
So she gather’d opinions all around
And put them all to test;
And none can question her judgment sound,
For the more she search’d the more she found
That Clausen’s Lager was best.
And the lovely eyes of the goddess gleam’d
As she spoke in her own good name :
Let this my verdict be x-ightly deem’d ;
Let the voice of Truth be well esteem d ;
Hand the “ Phoenix” brand to Fame.
Let it be Truth’s ; ’Tis the only one
That’s worthy my name to bear ;
Let Clausen's Lager henceforth be known
As the one that stands by itself alone ;
For, like Truth itself, ’tis rare.
CLAUSEN'S CHAMPAGNE LAGER.
THE AMERICAN PRIZE BEER.
la kept in all First-class Hotels everywhere, and
everybody drinks it.
It is the finest tonic that can be administered,
and is recommended to patients of weak constitu-
tions and nervous temperaments by the most pro-
minent physicians, in preference to all other
brands, as the purest and most wholesome
stimulant obtainable.
The following excerpts are from a mass of favor-
able testimony : —
“THE BEST ON THE MARKET.”
Messrs. Lucas Bros., wine and spirit merchants,
of 16, Pitt-street, write: —“With great pleasure
we add our testimony to the merits and great
superiority of Clausen’s Lager Beer. We have
been supplying it wholesale to our customers all
over the colony for some time. It has given
them the greatest satisfaction, and we feel bound
to say it is the best Lager Beer that has yet been
placed on this market. The bottles have largo
contents, the beer is entirely free from sediment,
is clear, bright, and sparkling, and above all re-
freshes without producing drowsiness. We find
its well-deserved patronage daily increasing,”
“SUPERIOR TO EVERY OTHER BRAND.”
Mr. Fred W. Forster, of the Theatre Royal
Hotel, say.:. : —“Having had considerable ex-
perience in America, where Lager is considered
the national drink, I have much pleasure in inform-
ing you that I have found Clausen’s Champagne
Lager Beer superior to every other brand, I have
had it on sale here ever since its introduction, and
am pleased to state that it has given unqualified
satisfaction to my patrons, all of whom speak of
it in the highest terms, and prefer it to every other
for its brightness, flavor, and purity. From a trade
point of view I have never had a single breakage
to complain of, or a bottle in bad condition ; and
can honestly recommend it as a perfect Lager in
every respect. It is entirely free from sediment
and waste, and is undoubtedly the leading brand
in the market, and in my opinion will long remain
so.
“ IN EVERY WAY PLEASED WITH IT.”
Mr. Harry R. Boulton, of Pfahlert’s Hotel,
W y n y ard - a q uare, says : —“ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the excellence of Clausen’s Cham-
pagne Lager Beer, which I have handled since
taking the above hotel. I am in every way pleased
with it, and for freedom from sediment, and excel-
lence of flavor, I have every confidence in recom-
mending it to the trade and the public generally.”
“ENTIRE SATISFACTION.”
Mr. Danie’ Sullivan, of the Brisbane Cafe,
George-street, says “ Clausen’s Champagne
Lager Beer gives my patrons entire satisfaction.
For brightness, purity, and flavor I consider it un-
equalled, and every person seeking a light refresh-
ing drink, which will invigorate without intoxi-
cating, and refresh without promoting drowsiness,
should sample a bottle of Clausen’s Lager.”
“ GREAT SUPERIORITY.”
Mr. G. F. Baker, proprietor of the Pastoral
Hotel, Wagga, says I have great pleasure in
bearing testimony to the great superiority of Clau-
sen’s Lager Beer. My customers approve of it,
and rarely ask for any other brand.”
“ FAR EXCELS ANY BEER,”
Mr, Bryan Ferry, of the Advance Australia
Hotel, Newtown, Wagga, says—“I have great
pleasure indeed in testifying to the excellence of
Clausen’s Lager Beer. It is pronounced by all my
customers to far excel any beers of a like
character.”
“ THE FAVORITE BRAND.”
Mr. F. L. Richardson, of the Albion Hotel,
Forbes, says “ I have great pleasure in recom-
mending H. Clausen and Son’s brand of Lager
Beer. It is the favorite brand with my custo-
mers, and during hot months the demand for it is
large.”
“ EXCELLENT QUALITY AND PURITY.”
Mr. Charles Stock well, of the Freemasons’ Hotel,
Molong, says “I have much pleasure in testi-
fying to the excellent quality and purity of Clau-
sen’s Champagne Lager Beer. It has given great
satisfaction to the numerous customers visiting
my hotel.”
It can be obtained from Messrs. Mason
Bros., limited, Fesq and Co., Tooth and Co.,

“THE DARNED APPARATUS THAT CAN’T LIE.”
YET HE SURPRISES HOUSEHOLDERS SOMETIMES, FOR ALL THAT.
HOW IT HAPPENED.
“I can never dine at home now,” said young
Mr. Parisgreen to a bachelor friend as he stepped
into a restaurant, “and I tell you this feeding-
outside business is keeping me mighty poor.”
“ And why not! You have a good cook; your
wife is an excellent housekeeper. I never got a
better dinner in my life than the time I sat down
at your hospitable table,” remarked the friend in
much wonderment. “I will tell you,” said the
exile, sadly. “About a week ago, in a moment
of mental aberration, I kissed the domestic who
carries the dishes to and from my hospitable table,
as you are pleased to term it.” “ Pooh, pooh, a
trivial occurrence,” said the friend, warmly ; “ a
very pretty girl, as I remember. I would have
kissed her myself, sir, without hesitation, had the
opportunity offered.” “No doubt, no doubt,” re-
plied the benedict, mournfully; ‘ ‘ hut then you
don’t live in the house, you know. Now, ever
since I kissed that young person she labours under
the delusion that she owns mo. When she tarings
in the soup tureen she leans lovingly against the
chair and mashes me in the most reckless and
positive manner. When she hands me the carvers
she endeavours to squeeze my hand, and she
pauses at the door leading into the kitchen to
thrill me with a parting glance of unutterable
affection. And all this time, while I am making
a pretext of enjoying my dinner, the cold perspira-
tion is running down my back, for my wife has an
eye like a hawk for this sort of phenomena, and I
don’t know the moment she will drop on it and
denounce me. No, no; home and I must be
strangers until that young female is discharged,”
and the victim of a momentary folly ate his soup
in intense and affecting melancholy, and then ad-
journed to find consolation before the mirror,
viewing his perfect-fitting, stylish Scotch tweed
suit bought for £3 3s. from Summerfleld and Com-
pany, the well-known Merchant Tailors, 235 and
237 Pitt-street, Sydney.*
A Good Remedy for a Cold. —On going to bed
take a dose of Freeman’s Chlorodyne, either in
water or camphor mixture. The diaphoretic action
of this excellent remedy speedily produces a
general glow, followed by a free perspiration, dur-
ing which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is
obtained, and on waking in the morning the cold
will be found to have dissapeared. The certainty
of the action of Freeman’s Chlorodyne is very re-
markable in Ague ; it frequently prevents an
attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of the
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Free-
man’s Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use
of Quinine, and in the tea gardens of India noth-
ing else is given for Ague and other forms of Fever.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade
mark, an Elephant.—obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers.
Mittchell’s old established and reliable original
reform chemist shop, 141 King-street, was recently
purchased by A. A. Rigney, of Bega, who will
conduct both establishments on the standard prin-
ciples for which he is well known.
TAKE WARNING:
At this season of the year when so many people become
subject to attacks of biliousness, kidney troubles, constipa-
tion and all the list of tumbles that aris; from being homed
up, or that are brought on by c flds and exposure, it is the
part of prudence to take wu-ning from the experience of
others and provide ourselves with the means of escape from
similar troubles: So wide is the fame of Dr. Bell's Bitters,
that great remedy for all kidney and liver trouble, that
almost everyone knows of its great virtue for such oases. It
should be kept in every household ready for an emergency.
Just recently the Elgin National Watch Co m-
pany, of Chicago, Illinois, has opened a branch
under the management of Mr. Donald Manson, ab
Elgin-buildings, a few doors from Pfahlert’s Hotel,
Wynyard-square, Sydney. Mr. Manson has been
appointed manager of the company for Australasia,
India, China, and Japan, and it is intended that
the company’s business with these countries shall
be conducted from the Sydney agency. The
watchmaking industry, as carried on by this com-
pany, has attained such vast proportions, and the
workmanship in each watch, even to the minutest
parts, is of such a mathematically accurate
character that some description of the works will
be of general interest. The enmpany was or*
ganised and licensed as “ The Elgin National
Watch Company of Chicago, Illinois,” on Angust
27, 1861, with an authorised capital of 500,000
dollars, but by an Act amendatory of the charter,
and approved on January 28, 1869, the authorised
capital was increased to 2,000,000 dollars, the
present capital of the company, and, as an evidence
of the success of the enterprise, the reserve fund
now amounts to 1,200,000 dollars, which, together
with the capital, represents a sum total equal to
£610,000. The watch factory in the city of Elgin,
Illinois, is built of brick and stone on about 22
acres of land. Connected with the main building
are the engine and boiler houses, the former con-
taining! woSO-hcrsepower Brown’s engines, to wo k
separately, or together; and the latter eight pairs
of boilers. To provide in part for the accommoda-
tion of over 3000 of its employees, the company
has built a number of cottages : also a large
boarding-house, with rooms warmed by steam-
pipes, and lighted by gas, the dining-room being
fitted with seating accomodaiton for 500 persons,
whilst for their comfort a large parlour, is hung
with pictures and provided with musical instru-
ments, libraries, and the current papers and
magazines. So much for what may be termed the
social life of the establishment. Referring to the
factory itself, the buildings cover an area of ovar
5 acres of ground. The length of the benches
on which the operatives sit at work would, if
placed in a row, extend over 4 miles, and the
shafting over 4j miles. At the Elgin factory, for
certain kinds of work, female operatives are pre-
ferred, on acount of their greater delicacy and
rapidity of manipulation, and it should be added
that women get the same wages as men for doing
the same kind and amount of work. As to the
work connected with the manufacture of the
watches, the greatest pains are taken by the
Elgin Watch Company in perfecting the original
model. Every variety of design and appliance
that human ingenuity can devise is sought for :
and a retinue of special artists, draughtsmen, and
inventors is continually busy to make each part
and process as economical and accurate as possible.
The “Elgin watch” is composed of 175 different
pieces, comprising upwards of 3400 separate and
distinct mechanical operations in its manufacture.
The Elgin Company manufacture 65 grades of
watches, which vary in price fiom 60s. to £lOO
each. The movements or works are made from
the finest quality nickel, steel, and brass, and the
cases which cover the movements of gold or silver.
All grades of Elgin watches are made with com-
pensating balances, hence their accuracy as time-
keepers. The watches are made on the inter-
changeable principle, so that if one piece should
break it can be replaced by a new one, to be ob-
tained of any reliable watchmaker, or at the
branch office of the company. These Watches can
be changed from a silver to a gold case without
loss of time or danger of having the wbrks spoiled
by taking them to pieces to have a new case made
of two plates with the wheels, &c., between.
The nicety of work required calls for marvellously
perfect machinery in the manufacture, and in this
respect the screw-making machines are wonders
of this invention, doing their work silently with a
nicety of precision that is almost more than
human. Twenty of these automatic machines
make from four to five; thousand screws per day,
exclusive of night work. To show the class of
work? we may state that from a roll of steel wire
costing the company five dollars, they can make
200,000 screws weighing only one pound and
worth 1500 dollars. The thread on the smallest
screw is so fine as to be almost microscopic, and
measurements have to be made by a fine-gauge
micrometer which will verify to within one two-
thousandth of a centimetre, that is to one-tenth
the thickness of a human hair.
After reading the foregoing, which we extract
from the S.M. Herald of October 30, the next
questions i-, of course, how is one to get an Elgin
Watch? In the meantime it will suffice to men-
tion that the Oriental Gold Co. having, after close
and long investigation, satisfied itself that the
Elgin is the best Watch in the world, and the
best value in all grades, has taken this line as a
specialty, and will henceforth handle no other
watch. This Company will post a sample Watch
of any grade or price to any address in the
colonies on its usual liberal terms. A Week’s trial
allowed. If not satisfied return the Watch un-
injured, and the money will be restored, less
postages. Not many quotations can be given this
week, but no one can go wrong in seizing this
single chance.
OS’ In order to introduce these watches, and open
up business, we offer THIS ONCE ONLY a
special advantage. We will fill all orders for a
single Watch which are sent to us, accompanied
by this coupon, before the end of the year. We
will not send more than one Watch to any person. ,
We will not send the Watch at the price unless '
the coupon accompanies the order.

WHA'
WILL convince you of the wonder-
ful curative properties combined in
Dr. Bell’s Bitters, if the remarkable
cures that have been effected by its use fail to impress
upon your mind this repeatedly proven fact. Thou*-
ands are using it,
it is a medicine
even more than
WILL
and all declare that
possessing all and
we claim for it. My
friend, if you are sick, or in that condition that you
cannot call yourself either sick or well, go and get a
bottle of Dr. Bell’s Bitters, and realise yourself how
this medicine hits the
right spot, and puts all
the machinery of your
body into working order.
ANOO
One of our prominent business men said to us the
other day ; “In the spring my wife got all run down
and could not eat anything ; passing a store I saw a
iot of Dr. Bell’s Bitters in the window, and I got a
bottle. After she had been taking it a week she had
a rousing appetite, and it did her a world of good.
.She took three bottles, and it was the best investment
ever made.”
DO YOU KNOW
That the very best Blood Purifier and Spring Medi-
cine is Dr. Bell’s Bitters.
That it cures Biliousness, Indigestion, Dyspepsia,
Headache, and Kidney and Liver Complaints.
That it is a wonderful medicine for Restoring and
sharpening the Appetite.
That it cures Scrofula, Salt Rheum, Boils, Pimples,
or other Diseases of the Blood.
I'f you suffer from any of these affections, try Dr.
Bell’s Bitters at once.
Dr. Bell’s Bitters as a Blood Purifier has no equal.
It tones the system, strengthens and invigorates,
giving new life.
The highest Medical Authorities pronounce it the
only known Specific for Kidney, Liver and Urinary
Diseases; that it has no equal as a BLOOD PURIFIER,
that it is the best safeguard against Contagious
Diseases, both acute and chronic, keeping the KID-
NEYS and LlVES,—the great organs of the body—
in healthy condition, disease then being impossible.
Note. —Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, or Old People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously upon written application to
the Agents, accompanied by a certificate of a Minister
of the Gospel, certifying that they are unable to pay
for medicine.

-ROWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to he.
ROWLANDS’ EUKONIA is a beautifully pure,
delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
lately been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr, Redwood
Ph D., F.C.S., &c. Sold in three tints; white,
rose, and cream.
ROWLANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now bo also
had in a golden colour, which is especially suited
for fair or golden-haired children and persons.
Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands’
articles, of 20 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid
spurious worthless imitations.
