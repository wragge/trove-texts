TWELVE SONNETS ON THE MONTHS.
S. Elliott Napier’s sonnet is tech-
nically brilliant; but though he has so finely
described our Australian Spring, he has not
made us feel that he has felt it.
Nina Murdoch, on the other hand, weaves
a fine tapestry of vivid details; her eighth
line is poetry, but her sestette is inconse-
quent :
“Jane’s” sonnet is charming, but that is
all. Duncan Brown paints, rather too de-
liberately, a pleasant picture, and enriches it
with one beautiful line, and his climax is
sonorous; but the whole lacks the lilt of
Spring:—
The prize sonnet by Charles F. Pettinger
(Hamilton, N.S.W.) has seemingly written
itself. from sheer joy of springtide.
It; suffers from a monotony of statement,
since seven consecutive lines begin with the
same word, and throughout there is a lack
of appreciation of the value of the caesura.
But here is no picture of our Australian
September; it is September itself, raptur-
ously felt. The sonnet will be found in its
place in another column.

JANUARY.
BY C. E. MOORE.
From blazing skies she comes with flaming
face,
And scant red robe the which no charm
conceals;
And Earth, the Titan, trembles when he
feels
The searing '•passion of her warm embrace.
Incarnate Bummer, full of languorous grace
And ripened lusciousness, her beauty steals
All gain from virtue —only that appeals
When July, austere, reigneth in her place,
So January—by day a scorching flame,
By night a liouri breathing love and bUss,
Like erring mistress fearing words of blame
Who stops her lover with atoning kiss.
Ah! Hail the heat of torrid days that frame
The velvet splendors of a night like this!
FEBRUARY.
BY S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
The scorpion summer — ev’ry burnish’d scale
Aflame with mortal agony and hate —
Crawls, blind and frenzied, to his venom’d
fate
And stabs his life out with his armed tail!
The sun is brazen and the skies are mail;
The airy argosies bear dusty freight;
And, see! The witches of the wind gyrate
O’er that which, once so green, has grown so
pale !
But, ah! Though February, burnt and bare,
May claim —and take- —his toll a little space,
Above his wailing western winds that parch
And through the haze that weights his sad-
den’d air,
There comes a whisper of autumnal grace:
There breathes a promise of the rains of
March!
MARCH.
BY MAKY A. K. ROBB.
Soon Summer’s symphony will be no more:
’Twas heralded by bursts of melody —
A sweet-voiced orchestra, unbatoned, free:
And, softer notes than these, that skyward
soar —
The glad, slow whisper through the gold
grain’s store:
The fretting of the stillness by a bee:
A twitter from a cradle in a tree:
And creeping waves caressing close the shore.
Methinks I catch a mellow, pulsing tone
Of swift, dark waters slipping, far away —
A patter of sloio drops from rain-drenched
things:
I hear a mutter from icide spaces lone
Whence ghostly winds are sped, that vagrant
stray—
’Tis Autumn’s heart atlirob upon the strings.
APRIL.
BY HERBERT TRACEY.
Didst hear a stirring in the trees last night?
Eerie and low it came, and went again,
But long the gaunt gums groaned like souls
in pain!
Was it the Ghost of Summer taking flight?
’Tis said that often when the stars are bright
It strives to woo fair April—but in vain —
The night-winds chase their quarry o’er the
plain,
And come like bloodhounds, dripping, from
the fight.
There is a portent in the pastel sky
Of wind, and drear discomfort, lurking near.
The mist-wrapped dawn wakes heavy eyed
each day
But turns to softened sunshine, warm and
clear;
And Autumn, frisking like the lamb at play,
Heeds not the Dingo, Winter, creeping nigh.
MAT.
BY NINA MURDOCH.
The chokos on the vine are turning white;
And sunset skies forego their vivid hues
For tender pinks and pastel greys and blues;
The black swans have begun their winter
flight
That bears them keening through the sombre
night;
While in the long grass dank with heavy
dews
The mating snakes creep silently in twos,
And winds go moaning as in sudden fright.
Running comes May with cheeks a little pale
And hair the wind has blown across her eyes,
Her flying feet set rustling all the sere
Dead leaves that mark autumnal April’s
trail,
And as she speeds, with sobbing breath she
cries.
“Alas! The winter is already here!”
JUNE.
BY HELEN POWER.
Surely some fay has been at work all night,
To change the drear, bleak world of yester-
day
Into this dream of silver, blue and grey,
Fit for an Ice-Queen’s Palace of Delight!
The very cart-ruts in the road are bright,
Decked by the frost with lines of braiding
gay;
Mists, opal-tinted, hang above the bay,
And orchards look like etchings, black on
white.
Festooned from every twig, with exquisite
art,
Millions of spiders’ webs with crystal hung
Sparkle like diamonds in the low sun’s rays.
And oh! the sound that brings me home, my
heart!
With what impassioned rapture upward
flung —
The magpies carolling their morning praise!
JULY.
BY NINA MURDOCH.
The fig-leaves fall before the wind in
showers —
A cutting wind that rushes from the west—
The snow lies thick on Kosciusko’s breast,
And on the coast the twisted ti-tree cowers
Before the rain! Lo! in an instant, bowers
Are filled with sunshine as at Spring’s behest,
And in a vision, August, golden tressed,
Passes tvith joyous arms weighed down with
flowers.
July is like an adolescent youth
That wakes the echoes with his boisterous
shouts,
And then falls dreaming for a sudden space
Lost in a maze ’twixt wonder and the truth
Because of joy and strange desires and
doubts
That move him at a passing maiden’s face.
AUGUST.
BY NINA MURDOCH.
Who can have robbed the winter of its sting
And tipped the stately bottle-brush with red,
And set the peewee calling overhead?
Who is it speeds on dancing feet to bring
The scented brown boronia, and to fling
The sarsaparilla on the bracken bed,
And seeing that the blue ivren fain would
wed
Splashes a deeper purple on his icing?
Oh! it is August, singing by the creek
And flitting to and fro upon the heath,
With busy fingers and bewitching ways
Of darting here a/nd there at hide and seek
To please her babe, the Spring, who under-
neath
A leafy shelter with a wild flower plays.
SEPTEMBER.
BY CHARLES F. PETTINGER.
Ah! who can tell the glory of these days —
The warm gold noons, the skies all sapphire
blue,
The halcyon sea of wondrous Tyrian hue,
The lush green paddocks crowned with tender
maize,
The clovered grass with orchid fires a-blaze,
The early morns, all incense and all dew,
The blosmy fruit-trees em’ralded anew,
The mystic mountains veiled in purple haze?
And oh! the sweetness of September’s
throat —•
The coach-whips and the cuckoos and the
larks- —
The wealth ot gold aotus she displays,
Of jessamine that ’broiders Spring’s blue
coat,
And waratahs aflame through bushland
darks —
The very earth is mad with joy and praise.
OCTOBER.
BY A. GLADYS KERNOT.
She came so fleetly that you scarce knew
where
Nor when she slipped from pale Septem-
ber’s fold;
A lissom witch in apple-green and gold,
Ten thousand prisoned sunsets in her hair:
Reincarnate —yet ah! so softly fair;
So warmly new, so wonderlessly old —
But who would dream so sweet a wench
could hold
A dusty niche on Time’s old calendar?
Yet she is here, bareheaded, in the street,
A rose between her teeth, an eye that mocks
The maundering traffic; with a carmined
lip,
And little sudden ways, and darting feet;
Her hair a-tumble with the equinox,
And Spring’s third baby slung across her
hip.
NOVEMBER.
BY NINA MURDOCH.
Swift have cicadas wakened through the
land,
With endless thridding; every mangrove
creek
Teems with a myriad crabs, that ravenous
seek
To stay their hunger in the oozy sand,
While shrill mosquitoes in a noisy band
Hanging above the waterholes bespeak
The Summer time; and■ countless parrots
streak
The scrub with vivid red on either hand.
So note her offspring spawned, and harvests
done,
Nothing more splendid can the year attain,
And, resting for a little space, she lies
Stretched at full length beneath the scorch-
ing sun.
With flanks still heaving from her travail
pain,
And calm of great achievement in her eyes.
DECEMBER.
BY S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
December’s ruddy manhood marches o’er
The stubbled fields which, gravid by the sun,
After long labor find their travail done
And gone the golden burdens that they bore.
The huddled herds seek out the shady store;
The peaches turn to amber, one by one;
The halcyon days of summer are begun
And sings the crested surf along the shore.
December, month of tears and tender tryst —
Thou varied true Epitome of Time!—
Thine are the dying year and procreant
Earth,
The types of Dissolution and of Birth:
Thou bring’st the circling seasons to their
prime.
And mark’st the sacred coming of the
Christ!
September
In the last of these monthly sonnet compe-
titions the level of excellence was high,
though, unexpectedly, faults of technique
appeared in several high-placed sonnets.
There were 37 entries. In the humorous
class, M. 8., “Scary Bird” and “O. Blastem”
performed well, the latter forwarding what is
probably the only snail-sonnet in existence.
The trouble with “O. Blastem” is that he
grows tomatoes —and snails :
What is a golden day? A jewelled night?
To him whose prize tomatoes droop and die.
Oh, damn September's slimy shellback pest t
Room once more for Mick Much; —
It’s now the snide strawdecker leaves the box,
The flvnet comes to light upon the track,
En’ tarts wear lids wif veils thet flip en’ crack,
More lacey, too, they show erbout the socks;
The bullicks git noo speargrass in their ’ocks,,
The foal’s canoodlin' roun’ the nudgin’ ’ack,
Too flamin’ soon we re roused be Kooky Jack,
Ell’ May does overtime in warblin’ flocks.
Like cows’ breath in the lucerne blows the Spring,
Frum rises jest like stage scenes set in gold
Uz through the bush the chorus songbirds sing.
Fair dink ! There’s somethun’ ’ints fur more than’s
told
Ter git yer goin’ till the ’at yer’d fling,
En’ do yer block uz in the grass yer rolled.
L.W.N. writes too astronomically of the
month; J. W. Fielding and Herbert Francis
O’Gonnell essay sonnets without knowledge of
the length of line reouired.
Fine sonnets were supplied by “O’Phim-
erty,” Arthur H. 0. Nash, B. C. Marriott-
Watson, Ruth Monteagle Varley (her fault
being uncouthness of diction), B. A. Lam-
prey (who, however, requires four rimes for
his octette), “Novern,” W. Calm (who makes
of “hours” a dissyllable), Jno. M. Prentice,
and L. J. Villiers (two).
Of the eight sonnets that remained for final
judgment two portrayed a Maoriland Septem-
ber and one a Tasmanian September. It is
unfortunate that under the conditions of this
competition the sonnets sent from M.L. have
to be disqualified. It is more than unfor-
tunate this month, since the two sonnets are
easily among the best in this month’s batch.
But this competition has shown that in Lilia
Gormhuille McKay Maoriland possesses a
sonneteer of distinction, a worthy rival of
our Nina Murdoch. The two M.L. sonnets
excluded because they do not present an Aus-
tralian September, are ; .
Between the mountain $ and the rippling sea,
Jocund she dances o’er the daisied hills,
Scatt’ring sweet buttercups by sparkling
rills;
Deftly enrobing blossom, shrub and tree;
Arrays the peach in roseate witchery;
Gold o’er the kowhai and the wattle spills.
The loom of Heaven softly, finely mills
Bloom-fabrics for her, all rich hues that be.
“0 Sweet September!”- sings the woodland
choir.
“0 Sweet September!” hums the murmuring
hive.
The dim bush sighs, its brown fronds still
close-curled,
Awak’ning as the rata lights her fire.
Nor men, nor maidens ’gainst her sweet spell
strive—
For Love and Spring have kissed the
southern world.
. ;v" . . ' Sam.
On emerald slopes the orchards break in
icide,
White seas of blossom-foam, and, as they
stray,
The fragrant winds cast shotoers of petal-
spray
Upon the grass. Aloft in crimson pride
The rata winds its splendid bonds to hide
Bare boughs of death beneath. So lightly
sway
Long trails of clematis, frail stars of day,
Tioined in a garland for a woodland bride.
The kowhai groves, in golden pageantry,
Are dulcet with the inis’ trills of mirth;
A-down the wind the elfin clarions ring,
The dark bush echoes with wild minstrelsy,
0 Life! O Joy! 0 wonder-time of earth!
September, and the ecstasy of Spring!
Lilla Gormhuille McKay.
Sonnets by Duncan Brown, “Jane,” Nina
Murdoch, Charles F. Pettinger, S. Elliott
Napier, A. Gore-Jones, and M.H. contest
the prize. First, M.H. must be regretfully
cast out; for she rimes “withdrawn” with
“forlorn,” a crime that, this page has already
publicly put on the statute-book of this com-
petition. But for this negligence M.H. had
an excellent chance of winning, as will be
seen from her sonnet
SEPTEMBER IN TASMANIA.
(Lowland.)
A flush of green, and then, all suddenly,
Flouting the sun, the magpie's fanfarade —
Spring is awake and down some ferny glade
Goes singing, singing, and the ecstasy
That is her song from every quivering tree
And from the nested things that crouch in
shade,
Leaps splendid to the hills, and wattles braid
With callow gold the garment of the sea.
(Upland.)
Cry of wet winds about the highland meres
Where, to the mountains and the snows with-
drawn
Winter seeks sanctuary and weeps forlorn
To feel his kingdom pass. The days wax
long
And pale September down a mist of tears
Drifts like the lingering cadence of a song.
Now sweeps the shuttle swiftlier through
the loom
Whereon the Great Designer's patterns
grow ;
The faded tapestries of Winter go,
And Spring's bright fabrics burgeon in their
room.
The peaeh-tree blushes into pregnant bloom:
The new-shorn flocks fleck hill and field with
snow ;
The eucalypts ’ auroral fingers glow,
And all the bush is brilliant with the broom.
Where pink boronia burns his /rapr« t'lnla
Wreathed to the waist with wild clematis
See, where the Siren of the Spring-time
September, with her eager, outstretched
hands; m- n
Compact of winsome wiles and wanton caj ,
Love on her lips, and in her eyes desire ■
A. Gore-Jones contents herself with gen
eralities: —
The peach blooms soft pink showers of glad
ness fling , . .
For fairy carpets 'neath her shy white je ,
Swift, silver rains have left the grass
S'VOGCt
And set the rippling creeks neiv songs to
sing.
The bushland slopes grow pale with blossom-
ing, /
The ardent sun restrains its fiery heat,
And sea and sky are clothed in colors mt t
To hail September, Spirit of our Spring. 4,
Such joyous lips she has, such star-blue et/^ s %
Such slim child breasts and pulsing, slender
throat.
Thus, for a little time she holds her place.
And if to-morrow fierce, parched winds
civisc
To-day the breeze, light as a laughter note,
But blows the shining hair across her face.
Oh, here are orchids, green and mauve and
tvhite,
Kissed by the shadoiv of the turpentine,
And here the scarlet desert-peas entwine,
With warm caress, the vernal saplings bright
And slender; suppliant, straining toward
the light,
The pink cpacris rears a starry spine;
The day is like a bowl of golden wine
And drowsy with pittosporums is the night.
Thus is the scheme of things, so long
A myst'ry, laid before us for a space
Devoid of all its ancient artifice,
September trills it in an artless song,
Bearing the simple message in her face
That all things earthly grow toward a kiss.
When bright September breaks the winter
hush
That stilled the noisy bushland’s merry
tongue,
From red-tipped eucalyptus scrub, o’er hung
With braids of purple creeper, wanton, lush,
That hide the greens and yellows in a
crush
Of richer color, joyfully is flung
The softest note in all the springtime sung —
The sweet low whistle of a mating thrush.
Quick to the call the waking bush world
thrills
With life aneiS, while light and shade and
song
Sway changefully like gaily-colored flocks
Of wheeling parrots in the lower hills,
That, screaming, give strange echo to the
long,
Loud music of the boisterous Equinox.

Getting Out of Bed
on the Wrong Side !
Did your husband get out from the wrong side
of the bed this morning ? Was he irritable,
inclined to grumble at everything and act like a
bear ? Don’t always blame his temper. More often
than not a man’s irritable disposition is due to
trouble with his liver or digestion and better
than all the soothing and coaxing, is just one or two

Get him to take two Cockle’s Pills to-night and no matter
how depressed, irritable or out-of-sorts he felt this morning,
he will be as “ fit as a fiddle” to-morrow. Cockle’s Pills are an
invaluable corrective for all disorders of the liver or digestion ;
they are made according to the

and are taken by doctors them-
selves.
The “Rocket ”
was the first locomotive in the world to run for

his valuable antibilious pill, which brought him

A WOMAN’S BIRTHRIGHT!
A CORRECTLY
DEVELOPED
BUST!
Every woman can have a perfect figure. A deficiency in bust is
readily corrected by Dr. Fallieue’s Flesh-Food treatment. The best
evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. E. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy:—
“After leaving off your treatment I waited several months
to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
I now wish to say that 1 think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it 1 was only skin and hones,
hut now 1 am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it anil really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. My health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
We haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but we will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many cases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches
have been made in the bust measurements. Guarantee given in every case.
Put up In tablet form, it is pleasant to take, and palatable. It leaves no unpleasant after-
effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Slight Misunderstanding at the Jasper
Gate.
Oh, do you hear the argument, far up above
the skies?
The voice of old Saint Peter, in expostula-
tion rise?
Growing shrill, and ever shriller, at the
thing that’s being done ;
More in sorrow than in auger, like our old
Jack Robertson.
Old Saint Peter’s had his troubles —heaps of
troubles, great and small,
Since he kept the gates of Heaven—but this
last one covers.all!
It is not a crowing rooster —that’s a sight
and sound lie’s useter,
Simulated by some impish spirit that he
knows full well;
It is simply Drake, of Devon, who is break-
ing out of Heaven,
With a crew of pirate brethren, to come
down once more to Hell!
Oh, do you hear the distant sound, that
seems to come and go,
As thunder does in summer time, when far-
away and low?
Or the “croon” beneath the church bells,
when they’re pealing from the tower —
And the church bells are the battle-call in
this dark, anxious hour.
Do you feel the distant throbbing? Do you
feel it go and come?
Like a war hymn on horizons, or a cen-
turies-mellowed drum !
Hear it sobbing, hear it throbbing, like
some not unhappy sobbing—
P»y the peaceful Devon landscape and the
fair Devonian home!
P>y the land those spirits meet in—and it’s
Drake’s Drum, spirit-beaten,
By perhaps the Rose of Sharon—and it's
calling Drake to come.
Oh, do you feel a cooling hand upon your
fevered brow?
That dulls your ears to Hell’s Own Din—
or that worse Silence, now?
In the starlight in the Channel, while De-
struction lurks below,
Or that Nether-Hell, the Stoke-hole, where
you cannot see or know?
Do you feel a soothing presence, keeping
sanity in one
Going mad, in Satan’s Nightmare, where
the gun-crew works the gun?
It is Raleigh!—Admiral-Poet, who had
dreams though few may know it—
Aho had dreams of England’s greatness.
otherwise than by the sea.
Sorrowful but all-forgiving, bringing cour-
age to the living—
Raleigh’s Spirit, not from London, but his
Vanished Colony.
Oh, do you feel a stony calm that you had
never known?
With comrades in the firing line, or “Sentry
Go” alone.
When it’s Hellfire all around you, and it’s
freezing slush below.
Or you pace in rain and darkness, with Old
Death, and “Sentry Go”—
Feel a cold determination that makes all
but Now a blank ;
That’s half foreign to your nature, and half
foreign to your rank?
It is Wellington, where French is, who has
broken Heaven’s trenches,
With his purple-blooded captains (who used
purple language then)
Come to strengthen with his spirit all the
coolness you inherit—
He who took the scum of Europe, and
trained them to be Men.

wings for me !
Over the trees, over the hills, drop like a
shooting star. Swallow—
Cleave the mist, leave the mist; follow me
out to sea !
Lift in the breeze, drift in the breeze, high
on your pinions poise, Petrel;
Glance the waves, chance the waves; dip.
and whip the foam.
Wheel in the gusts, reel in the gusts, these

Rive the spray, drive the spray; harry the
breakers home!
Leap to the gale, sweep to the gale—hark
to the storm-gods roar, Gannet!
Sheer the rain, clear the rain. Wings O
wings alift!
Sway with the airs, stray with the airs;
into the whirlwinds soar, Gannet;
Wend the wrack, rend the wrack, out where
the scud-clouds drift!
Out of the gloom, out of the shades, beat to
the sapphire space, Falcon !
Churn the wind, spurn the wind ; glide with
your wings outspread.
Up to the height, up to the light, into the
great void race, Falcon;
Trim the blue, skim the blue, over the moun-

Follow me mute, follow me lone, follow me

The Scientific Light Weight
of the Hudson 6-40
Light weight has become the chief demand of discriminating buyers
of automobiles, and light weight is an important feature of the
I ludson 0-40. This lightness means greater comfort, less depreciation,
greater endurance, and greater mileage from fuel and tyres. Yet
this car is one of the sturdiest on the road.
The Hudson 6-40 has perfect balance and flexibility. You will find
none of its class handsomer, none better equipped, none with more
comforts or more conveniences. It is a masterpiece—favored wherever
it is known —and peculiarly suited to Australian needs.
II has distinguished streamline body, with receding bonnet and dash,
domed mud-wings and wire wheels. Finished in grey throughout.
Electric self-starter and lighting. Two folding seats and accommoda-
tion for seven persons. One-man hood and cover. Luggage grille.

desperately .scarce with the Government just
now. The (Iryness is bad. The railway
charges have been put up. The needless and
insane distances which wheat has, in many
cases, to be carried for export so that the
trade may go through Sydney, to the profit
of the private landlords and the middlemen
and traders (often German traders) thereof,
are as long and as costly and as hopeless as
ever. The wheat trade isn’t one of the best
at any time, for this country has a surplus of
the substance, which it has to sell abroad at
any price the foreigner likes to give for it. On
the other hand, by reason of its utterly
inefficient tariff, it has a deficiency of boots
and clothes and hats and steel rails and
other things, which it has to buy at any
price the foreigner likes to charge. And to
fill the gap it borrows at any old rate of
interest the foreigner likes to demand. It
is characteristic of Holman, the polite
barrister, and McGowen, the stolid and
religious boiler-maker, that they should select
this time of battle and impecuniosity for
rushing into a new industry of which they
know absolutely nothing, and that they
should also rush into it when lack of rain
makes it specially precarious. It is reckoned
that the experiment will require £1,000,000
capital, and the dissipated Ministry has, in
the form of loose cash, about £3,000,000 less
than nothing. The scheme, begins with
joyous talk of the crop that is to be grown
next year, but anybody, save McGowen, the
kindly boiler-maker, and Holman, the well-
meaning barrister, ought to know that agri-
culture can’t be hurried at that headlong
pace, and that if the wheat comes up in
1916 the experiment will be very blessed and
very fortunate.
* * * *
The agriculturist who is at present toiling
on land which he bought from the State
isn’t having any too good a time. Many a
man who spent £lOOO or £2OOO on the pur-
chase of soil will be a very glad person this
year if he makes £lOO as wages and interest,
even if he works his farm single-handed and
toils for such hours as a Sydney trades-
unionist wouldn’t dream of. Still he recog-
nises that the world is wide, and that the
demand for food is continuous, and that
good days will come again. He doesn’t
object to the proposed Government farming,
provided the cards are not stacked, and the
dice aren’t loaded, and the horse isn’t given
a pick-me-up immediately before the race.
To put the matter more plainly, he desires:
(1) That the Government won’t tax him,
either in the matter of revenue or loan in*
terest, to grow its wheat; (2) that it won’t
feed its State wheat enterprise with specially
cheap loans and leave the high-priced loans
for other purposes; (3) that it won’t carry
its workers to and fro on free passes at State
expense; (4) that it won’t grant itself
specially cheap rates for its fertiliser and
stores on the way up and for its produce on
the way down ; (5) that it won’t give its
goods preference on the railways or the
Sydney wharves over other people’s goods;
(6) that it will claim no exemption from
local or State or Federal rates and taxes;
(7) that it will in no way “fake” its
accounts; (8) that it won’t wrangle with
the Auditor-General if he complains about
the accounts; and (9) that it won’t try its
experiment on land that is more adjacent
to the one N.S.W. port from which export
is allowed than the average of the State’s
wheat land.
* * * *
These propositions are put forward
because the great borrowing Government
of the barrister and the boiler-maker hasn’t,
so far, made much of a success of its State
enterprises. An impression prevails that it
regards them, not so much as investments
which ought to return a profit to the com-
munity, as devices by which Holman and
McGowen may acquire the popularity which
means votes, and may splash public money
around for their own political advertisement.
They (quite justifiably) raised the wages
of the railway and tramway employees, and
thereby acquired public support, but they
didn’t do the honest yet unpopular deed of
raising the railway and tramway charges
till the profit had all disappeared, and
the shortage had risen like an armed
man and struck the Treasury in the
eye. They built Daceyville with great
pride, and paid high union wages to the
builders and to the getters of materials, and
they let the houses at the lowest possible
rate, and they took the limelight and the
advt., and then they entered into bitter dis-
cussion when it was reported that their
experiment wasn’t paying. They started
quite a number of new State enterprises,
including bricks and road-metal, and it is
darkly suspected that they don’t make any
of them pay and don’t care very much
whether they pay or not. The Holman-
McGowen combination, so far as the evi-
dence goes, has three sources of popularity
—two positive and one negative: {1) It is
popular with the public employees ‘to whom
if pays increased wages; (2) it is popular
with the Sydney traders and capitalists and
monopolists (many of them Germans, as can
be seen on inspection of the brass plates in
York-street and thereabouts) to whom,
despite the decentralisation plank in its
platform, it carefully conserves practically
all the State’s business; and (3) it isn’t
wildly unpopular with the unthinking mass,
because, by spending loan money at the rate
of £10.000,000 a year (it has now got to
that point) it can grant all these concessions
for a while without being very nasty or
expensive to anybody. Things, it reckons,
will last its time. The fact that the. bill
must come home with compound interest
one of these days hasn’t’ struck the unthink-
ing multitude yet.
* * * *
The Holman-McGowen Ministry has a
really wonderful capacity for leaving undone
the things it promised, to do and doing the
things that are not ip its sailing directions.
It was pledged to keep the public finances
straight, to reduce borrowing, to abolish the
State Governor and the State Upper House
oi Nominees, to be politically honest, to stick
to the principle of State leasehold, and to
promote decentralisation. (These two latter
items would have got a good show if State-
owned cities had been established at the
neglected ports of New South Wales.) It
wasn’t pledged to run petty brickworks, or
tile works, or a few rows of cottages, or a
road-metal quarry, or a wheat-farm, at public
expense. With its usual boundless and
shoreless cussedness it abandoned the mat-
ters which were on its programme and
rushed after the other matters. So far it
has disguised its unscrupulousness and its
incapacity with Cohen’s money, but that
sort of thing can’t go on for ever. Still
there is a regretful impression that two of
the worst political pirates that New South
AVales has seen will never be hanged so high
as they should be. The human race has a
streak of sympathy for the dashing adven-'
turer, either in politics or in finance or in
bushranging on the high seas. Even Madam
dtj Bakry has had an heroic drama written
about her, and various perfectly honest Ger-
man poets of some centuries ago were regret-
ful when a stolid, unimaginative admiral
from Hamburg broke up the fleet of the
Victualling Brethren, and threw most of the
captured Victuallers overboard. If the
barrister and the boiler-maker go out of
office, by reason of a great splurge, at grow-
ing amateur wheat in drought time with
£1,000,000 of borrowed - money, quite as
many people will weep over them as wept
over Ned Kelly or Dicic Turpin or Robin
Hood.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fall.
Antwerp, the second port in the world, and
reputed to be the second-best fortress in
Western Europe (Paris ranks first), has
fallen, and great was the fall. The city
lasted 40 hours after the bombardment com-
menced. The Kaiser William people had
siege guns of a range never before imagined,
and the splendid Belgian defences were
battered to pieces without getting in
an effective shot by way of reply. These
are presumably the sort of guns with which
the Germans propose to attack British towns
from the French coast, and reduce Bull to
dust and ashes at long range. Yet the
Kaiser is no nearer victory than he was
before, despite the fact that Berlin lighted
itself up with a multitude of illuminated
lager beer in honor of the capture. It has
been nroved once more that the German is a
superb mechanic, and when he attacks a
city—a city being a thing which has to re-
main in one place and fight out the argu-
ment —he can do better than anybody else at
present on earth.' But in the open field he is
doing only moderately well. The h u ß e guns
which shattered Antwerp are of no value
against the fast-moving French and British
and Belgian and Russian infantry, and if
they attempt to tackle the flying cavalry of
Russia it will be a case of a mammoth
pursuing a hawk. It wa's characteristic of
the vast, plodding, methodical character of the
German military machine that, while it broke
up, inside 40 hours, the second-best fortress
in Western Europe, yet the Anglo-Belgian
garrison broke through all opposition and got
away. Also that the garrison had the best
of the discussion whenever it was a matter
of personal endeavor. In the matter of
huge and lumbering ironmongery the Ger-
man is distinctly on top, but the big iron-
mongery can’t be shifted fast enough to be
the deciding factor in the game. In the
capture of Antwerp the Germans have
achieved a success which has put some heart
into the drooping tail of the Fatherland.
They have got closer to England than they
ever were before. But the port of Ant-
werp is a river, and the mouth of the river
is in Dutch territory, and as Holland is
neutral the outlet can’t be used for German
naval or commercial purposes without mak-
ing a new enemy. Germany can’t afford to
make new enemies. The place was acquired
at great cost. It will have to be garrisoned.
The valiant remnant of the Belgian army
is still at large, like the persons who mur-
dered Julius CLusar ; and it has been re-
inforced by what was left of the Antwerp
garrison. Meanwhile the Franco-British
army is steadily pushing the Germans out of
France, and Russian commanders, whose
long and unpronounceable names are a sin,
are gaining every day another mile or so on
the long roads which lead to Budapest and
Vienna and Berlin. In the matter of the
gigantic weapon which takes cities —a city
being a fixed creature and unable to make
sudden flank movements—the Germans have
shown that they are The Goods. The fact
is so obvious that it deserves repetition. But
in the open field Hans and Fritz appear to
be just a fraction inferior to the people
whom they have attacked in so large and
cheerful a fashion. And it is that fraction
or decimal —call it .05 —which will ulti-
mately shove the Kaiser over the edge of
the precipice.
Where the American Comes In.
In the Sydney Telegraph of October 10
appeared an advertisement which ought to
make any good Australian feel quite dashed
wild. It started with this beautiful head-
line : —•
GERMAN GOODS—REPLACE THEM FROM
AMERICA.
When the war of guns is finished the war of
commerce will resume with extra energy.
The man of the United States —who calls
himself “American,” as if he were the only
Yankee on the beach, and as if the Canadian
and the Mexican and the Brazilian and the
Chilian and the Argentine and all the rest
were non-existent —gets in early with an
appeal for support for his Oil Trust, and
his Beef Trust, and his Peanut Trust,
and his other trusts. Yet the Ameri-
can” has been a very poor friend to
the British Empire. He always believed in
selling everything and buying nothing. In
1913 he managed to sell to Britain over
£141,000,000 worth of goods, while only tak-
ing £29,000,000 worth of Bull’s own pro-
ducts in exchange. For the balance he
wanted plain cash. The German was a.
vastly better customer to Bull. As regards
Australia, the latest British figures (figures
are taken from the Statesman’s Year
Book, as it seems fair to quote the same
authority in each case) show that Australia
bought from the United States to the extent
of nearly £10,000,000, while the States only
bought in return to the extent of a little
over £2,000,000. In other words, it required
between £7,000,000 and £8,000.000 of good
Australian gold to square Uncle Samuels
account. On the other hand, Germany
bought from us to the extent of £7,500,000,
and sold to us to the amount of a little over
£5,000,000', and sent us more than £2,000,000
of coin to balance the year’s transactions.
Certainly the German did this kindness to
us because it suited him to do it. And the
calls himself “American, as
if he owned the entire continent —had every
right to take advantage of the foolishness
and incapacity of our tariff, and annex all
the trade that came in his way. Yet the
fact remains that the profit which Australia
has made out of its German trade has
helped this country materially to arm against
Germany, and but for the tremendous loss it
has always made on its United States trade
it might have armed much more effectively.
In fact, the one-sided character of Aus-
tralia’s United States trade has drained the
Commonwealth of more cash than the Ger-
man war is likely to cost it. The United
States hasn’t supplied a copper, or a soldier,
or any kind of material support to the Brit-
ish Empire or its allies in this tremendous
struggle. It doesn’t even hint, at lending
assistance. All it offers is its mild approba-
tion and a fresh shipment of merchandise,
to be paid for on delivery. Therefore good
Australians find a bitter aggravation in the
advertisement
GERMAN GOODS—REPLACE THEM FROM
AMERICA.
Seeing that Australia is part of the British
Empire, and is doing its little bit to carry
the Empire’s burden, it would be much more
patriotic and logical to replace German goods
with Australian products. What special
debt of gratitude, in a commercial sense,
does this country owe to Samuel at Wash-
ington?
The Empire’s Oil Supply.
When war was declared about the first thing
that happened in England was the wlmle-
sale commandeering of horses. Every size-
able farmer in the country was told that
the Government would probably call for
half his draught stock. Since then very
little has been heard about transport
horses, but a tremendous lot has
heard about motor waggons ana - n
petrol-driven vehicles; audit s ho se
that victory can t come to c.ny siae
oil supply runs out. How Britain
allies are placed in regard to oil on y
know; how Australia is placed on y
know, too. It is, however, highly
that Australia has a comparatively poo
supply for its naval and other requirem *
It could get more, of course, by drawi g _
Britain. But that means heavy ex P®*‘ se ’
and, anyhow, isn’t it disreputable tor a
country with the finest known deposi
oil shale in the world to loaf on Untain,
which has no oil wells at all, and no g
shale deposits, for one of the things
which Britain’s own life depends.
N.S.W. shale deposits and works at
Capertee and Hartley are all idle.
Commonwealth Oil Corporation, of London,
mismanaged the business so atrociously that
failure was inevitable, and an industry,
which had been in existence for nearly hair
a century, was thus knocked flat. But the
madness of the methods of the London co.
did not affect the value of the deposits in
the smallest degree. The shale is as rich
as ever it was, and large quantities or it
are immediately available. It is probable
also that a fair amount of the plant could
be put to very early use. One of the first
things the Commonwealth Government
should do is to lay its hand on the whole or
this idle undertaking, and tell the owners
that the property may.be wanted. Simul-
taneously one man or two or half a dozen
men should be hurried up to Newnes to say
whether anything can be done with the
plant, and, if so, approximately at what
price oil can be produced. It is highly
probable that, with capital cut down to very
little (for, of course, no fancy price would
be paid for the long-idle works, etc.), costs
would run very little, if any, higher than
the Government is at present paying for oil.
And the country could afford to pay some-
thing more than it pays the foreigner. Above
all things, the present need is to keep our
people employed, by putting them to produce
our requirements; and we can far _ better
afford to pay ourselves £6 a ton for oil than
anybody else £4.

Charity Begins at Home.
The proposal that Australia should make a
grant of £IOO,OOO to help the Belgian ally
who has borne the heat and ruin of the fray
on which the safety of the British Empire
depends—the gallant but homeless ally,
whose women and children are tramping for
the nearest place of safety, and living on
raw vegetables as they go—brought forth
two dissentients in the Senate. One was
Senator Blakey, of Victoria, and the other
Senator Stewart, of Queensland. They
said that the money ought to be applied to
the relief of the unemployed in Australia.
Just here the Government should appoint a
Commission or some creature of the sort, to
discover why there is any special amount
of unemployment in Australia. The war
hasn’t damaged a house, or a shack, or a
gunyah, or a lean-to, or even a bough-shea
in all this continent. It hasn’t disarranged
a gum-tree of a coal-scuttle. It hasn’t in-
jured the wheat, or the barley, or the pota-
toes, or the sugar-cane, or the oats, or the
tomatoes, or the wool, or the silver, or lead,
or tin supply, or the gold, or the meat, nor
has it interrupted the sleep of the hides. In
fact, it has shoved up the price of many
articles, and has reduced competition in
numerous lines of industry. None of the
countries adjacent to us —Maoriland, India,
the Malay Peninsula, Burmah, Siam, China,
Japan, Eastern Russia, Canada, the United
States, Mexico, Central America, Peru,
Chili, Argentina, Brazil, etc.—-has been
struck or banged by the disasters of recent
strife. Even Tonga has "mulled through.
Australia hasn’t been embezzled of one ship
of any great value. This country ought to
be on top of a wave of prosperity, and
making money out of Europe’s misfortunes.
The only explanation why it isn’t doing so
is that the foreign borrowing policy is a
snare; that the policy of depending_ on for-
eign countries to buy our raw materials and
to supply us with manufactured goods is a
fraud ; that the anti-immigration policy is a
great foolishness; that the congestion of
people into big cities is plain lunacy; and
that the Low Tariff device, with all its
consequences and ramifications, isn’t up to
much. Australia, as a great wool and gold
and silver and wheat and tin and lead and
iron and meat country, and as a country
with great empty spaces and a blessed im-
munity from the horrors of bombardment,
might be expected to make its fortune these
days by supplying pants and calico _ and
cannon to Europe. Instead there is a
clamor about shortage of work, and Senators
Stewart and Blakey are moved to. say
that charity begins at home. The political
system calls for careful overhaul.
Loans, Tariffs and Sundries.
Dear Bulletin, —A helpful movement of
recent days was “the meeting of delegates
representing the city [Sydney] and Metro-
politan Labor leagues convened by the
Darlinghurst [Sydney] P.L.L.” It appealed
to the Federal Government “to issue a loan
sufficient to enable the States to carry out
works of a reproductive nature on the full-
time system, the loan to be raised by means
of an issue of notes by the Commonwealth
Bank.” Apparently this slummocky N.S.W.
body overlooked a number of things. In the
first place', there are hardly any reproductive
works nowadays in its State, the Holman-
McGowen push having muddled things until
nearly everything has drifted into a non-
productive condition —that is to say, almost
everything has got to the point at which
interest and working expenses absorb more
than earnings. Secondly, the raising of a
loan by the issue of Commonwealth notes
to enable all the States to continue building
unprofitable works at their own sweet will
for an indefinite period—presumably till the
war is over and the regular loan business
can be resumed —may not be possible. If
the war lasts three years, N.S.W. alone, at
the pace its Government is setting, will be
clamoring for £30,000,000 of toans. For
Sfthe Commonwealth about £60,000.000 of
loans will probably be wanted. And even
if every member of the Labor crowd made


it a rule to refuse gold, and to demand
payment in notes, it "would be difficult to
keep such a mass of paper in circulation.
As a matter of fact, the average toiler
shows no useful sympathy with the Federal
paper money idea. The bulk of the artisan
population, so far as I know it, wants’to be
paid in gold and silver. The artisan doesn’t,
as a rule, hand a £IOO note to his wife
for housekeeping purposes, but in the
matter ' of small change he has a choice
between' the ten-shilling note and the half-
sovereign. The extent to which he backs
up his own Federal paper money ideal may
be gauged by the fact that the circulation
of Federal ten-shilling notes for all
Australia amounts to less than £60,000. If
the Darlinghurst P.L.L. had put all its loose
assets on the table at its famous meeting
it would probably have been found that, in
proportion to its means, it was doing as
little to encourage the circulation of Aus-
tralian notes as any other body in the
Commonwealth. If the worker lent real
first aid to the paper money proposition the
ten-shilling note would be the ' most
prominent item in the business, instead of
standing for less than £60,000 in a total
output of well over £13,000,000. Even the
arrogant fat man who takes' £IOOO notes —
and lie is very rare even amohg fat men —
lends the movement a fair measure of
support, and the demand' 1 for £5 and £lO
and £IOO notes is quite considerable. The
circulation of £IOO notes be'ats that of ten-
bob notes almost twenty-fold. If any Political
Labor League wants to be helpful in these
times it should go on strike unless its
members are paid in Federal paper, and it
sh6uld denounce as a blackleg any member
found carrying gold coin about him. Apart
from all this, it would have been much more
sensible if the P.L.L. had proposed that
Australia should iihport a great deal less,
and send away much less money to pay for
the boots and clothes supplied by doubtful
friends and very probable enemies, and
should do some real work, instead of
inventing new borrowing tricks and devices.
To take a single instance, Australia imports
nearly £10,000,000 worth of goods per
annum from the United States, and included
in the total is a vast mass of agricultural
machinery, which is mostly Lased on stolen
Australian inventions. In return the United
States buys about £2,000,000 worth of
Australian goods. This country has to dig
out about £5,000,000 a year of its good
borrowed money so that its own people may
be unemployed, while this big .um goes to
prop up a community which hasn’t wasted
a ship 1 or a -soldier or a copper to help
Britain or its allies in the day of trouble.
The P.L.L. crowd is hereby invited to give
more attention to the tariff and less to the
lOU.—Yours, etc., Solomon Malaprop.

Land Settlement and Land Gambling.
Certain landowners of Victoria, who pose
as .“poor farmers,” are at present harassing
Premier Peacock over, what are miscalled
“spotted titles.” The..main idea in the
Cabbage Garden’s policy of Closer, Settle-
ment is to get people, on the land and keep
them there, and to that end all. recent C.S.
Acts and Irrigation Acts have stipulated
that no person may hold more than a cer-
tain fixed area; also in the first C.S. Act
there was one clause—No. 69 —which fixed
continuous residence as an essential con-
dition of the title. Immigrants and Aus-
tralians have been attracted to these blocks
by.the easy terms of purchase, and they get
a free grant of the land in due course, but
always with the residence condition. To
the genuine, settler, whose aim, is to, make a
home, which he won’t w r ant to leave in his
declining years, but will desire ,to pass on to
his children, this condition matters, little if
anything, but to the land speculator and. the
land grabber it means everything, Which is
why Liberalism is prepared to fight Clause
69 to the death. Ex-Premier Watt was
subjected to the same pressure, and, to his
credit, withstood it, but there are signs that
Ids successor finds bis tail weakening, and
fears the effect of firmness at the ; coming
elections. Wherefore it may be well to
assure Peacock of the laugh and the tail
that, no matter how lie may fare next
month, his refusal to back down on this
essential point of land settlement won’t
lose him a solitary vote, for the reason that
his opponents are even more certain to up-
hold it than he is. On the other hand, his
concession of the point will lose him the
votes of many supporters who want to see
the State settled and a genuine yeoman class
put on the soil and kept there.
The Melbourne Tramways Muddle.
In the Victorian Assembly last week the
Minister for Public Works was tackled on
the question as to whether the • Peacock
Government had any plan for dealing with
the Melbourne Tramways when the sinful
lease of the M.M.T. Co. expires in 1916, and
the old cable-tram system should at once
come under some form of municipal control.
Minister llageltiiorn could only promise
that he would probably be able to announce
this week the Government’s unreadiness to
reteal any policy whatever. Now the Met..
Tramway Co. is, next to the infamous Gas
Co., the most profitable public concern which
Private Enterprise in Melbourne has ever
handled. The paid-up capital is £170,000,
and the dividends paid to shareholders within
the 30 years of the monopoly’s existence —to
shareholders who took no’risk at the outset,
seeing that profits' were assured and com-
petition was totalled
£2,000,000 thus far. ' And there are still
dividends 'lO come ere the co.’s shabby old
plant and rolling stock* is taken over at a
false price—by whom? That the M.M.T.
Co.’s private enterprise expects to be well
rewarded up to the very end of the chapter
is shown by the present market quotation
of 365. 6d. for £1 shares. Public interest
shrieks., for the termination_.of. the bloated
monopoly, which will reach the end of its
legal tether in 1916. Private wire-pullers
and a feeble Ministry are, it seems, equally
anxious to keep the bloated monopoly going
a while longer. The schemers are reaching
for more plunder, the Ministry is shrinking
from more worry. What is to be the con-
stitution of > the Trust that will eventually
take control "of the M.M.T. Co.’s system,
not to. mention a dozen other tramway ser-
vices worked by various authorities within
the metropolitan radius? When the 30-odd
years’ lease was granted to the fat, private
monopoly, the public inanely understood that
its plant and its right o’ road would be trans-
ferred at the expiration of its lease to the
cohtrol'of the 11 or 12 municipalities then
existing. The politicians of the period gave
no; thought to the morrow, and the business
men who were managing the tramway job
had every reason for putting their tongues
in their cheeks. Melbourne in another 30
years was to be the same city as regards
municipilisation! But in 30 years the popu-
lation has doubled, and the 12 blessed “cities”
have increased to 23, each with a mayor,
corporation, town clerk and other attributes
of civic dignity. And the original Met. tram-
way lines have been extended to these out-
lying municipalities, and the traffic there
provided is accountable for much of the
£2,000,000 which the M.M.T. Co. has paid
away in dividends. Therefore, now that the
original dozen municipal parties to the tram-
way agreement claim a right to take over
the business 1 from Private Enterprise and
work it themselves, the 11 more recent bodies
of mayors and coupcillors naturally scorn the
proposition. So the Peacock Government
is called upon to appoint a Tramway Trust
or Department, which will control all the
lines and administer the profits in an
equitable w r ay, after deciding the vexed
question of fares. The Peacock Government
is “up against it.” The public want lower
fares —or penny sections on twopenny lines,
the rival municipal authorities want the
most profitable scheme of control they can
get, the old M.M.T. Co. bloodsuckers want
to hang on to their juicy joint for at least a
year or two after their wifcked lease has
run .out, and the Ministry wants to distract
attention from its incompetence until after
the forthcoming election.
The Tap-room War Expert.
Cry of rage from “H. Singemoine” :—•
The community proceeds as a matter of course
against noisy drunks, persons who spit on. the foot-
paths, rabbits, lantana, ticks (outside Queensland),
inadequately costumed surf-bathers, sellers of adul-
terated beer, vendors of bad fish (including lobsters,
prawns and oysters), and a thousand other aggra-
vations. Yet the indigenous war-expert, a flagrant
impostor, who is as annoying as any of them, and
far harder to :elude, is suffered to go unassailed.
The writer has wandered over most of Europe in
his time. He knows Paris and Brussels almost as
well as he does Sydney. Also, he has been accus-
tomed-to read as much as the average man all his
life. Yet he freely confesses that, up to a couple
of months ago, he did not know that the Germans
would have to take Liege to reach Paris,; he knew
nothing of 'Namur or Montmedy or Longwy. In the
incredible event of the gubjgct. ,of Namur having
been brought up in a tram or bar during (say) last
June, he .would not have been able to dash off in
a casual manner the name of so much as one of- the
forts of that ancient town. He did not know what
a -cupola was or a revetment, or an army corps.
He was not aware that Bismarck had always depre-
cated the idea of Germany making war on two
frontiers. Had he been asked quickly, and without
being given the opportunity to get at a reference
book, for any three of the military opinions of von
Bernhardi, he would have been struck dumb. He
understood, in "a general way, that there was some-
thing wrong with the Kaiser’s left arm, and that
one of his ears had had to be operated on, but l.e
had no idea that this sovereign was, a mass of
disease and a lunatic, nor that all the lloi-ienzol-
lerns, and likewise the members of the Hapsburg
family, were similarly afflicted. Two months ago,
if anyone had told him vvliat is now accepted as a
truism, namely, that the whole of Central Europe,
from the Baltic ’to the Adriatic, is ruled by malig-
nant imbeciles, he would have been incredulous. To
express doubt on these questions, at the present time
of day, is taken, in most of our best publie-
houses, as a proof of disloyalty to the Empire.
The blame for this and innumerable other absurdi-
ties lies at the large, flat, humorless feet of the ama-
teur war expert. He incites normally quiet and in-
offensive. citizens to break the peace in several direc-
tions. He irritates, in the first place, by heaping on
his fellows masses of information which they already
possess. We now all know about Verdun and Chalons,
and the rivers Aisne and Meuse, though most of us,
including 99 per cent. - of the experts, had hardly
heard of them till the other day; also, we can
describe a Turco and Pathan ’ and a cuirassier, and
we are in a position to talk familiarly of General
Joffre and Vice-Admiral Jellicoe and the defences
of Antwerp. We have garnered the information either
from the daily newspapers, or from the sources on
which the papers depend for their knowledge, namely
the current text-books and encyclopedias. This sort
of stuff would have been news a few weeks ago ; now
it is merely boresome tripe.
Equally pernicious are the strategical deductions
which the war expert draws from the cables. He
justifies his authoritative pronouncements by the fact
that, in youth, he was a Boy Scout or cadet or
volunteer warrior of some other sort. For the rest, he
has probably never been away from Australia. He
has not seen a real battle anywhere. He does not
know anything from personal experience of the country
where the fighting is going on ; of the climate; of the
personnel of the troops ; of the resources of the dis-
tricts they are in—in fact, he knows nothing essential
whatever. It is quite likely that no one in the
Commonwealth knows anything worth mentioning of
what is occurring in the north-west of France. The
generals on both sides seem passionately eager that
the outside world should discover as little as possible
of their intentions. How idiotic, then, for our local
bar-loafers to posture as the possessors of inside in-
formation on this vast and intricate subject! These
are the liars who helped to disseminate the yarns
about the loss of the Australia, the sinking of 30 or
more British ships ip the North Sea, and so on ; and
they are the persons of rotten judgment who believed
that a quarter of a million Britishers had landed at
Ostend weeks ago, and that the- German retirement
from Paris was a rout. In the writer’s opinion they
ought to be resolutely tackled like any other- public
nuisance. The drafting of a short Act for their sup-
pression would be received with hearty cheers by
thousands of harassed Australians.
The “Sydney Morning Herald” upon the
Advantages of the Federal Capital
Which it Scorned.
The S. M. Herald cordially approved of
N.S.W. Lands Minister Treble's move to
give pastoralists in drought-stricken parts
of the State a fair' deal’ all round in regard
to obtaining agistment' areas for their
hungry stock in the “snow belt” —-that big
area of productive country , which luxuriates,
so to speak, on the knees of Kosciusko. In
token of its approval the Herald printed a
special article in its agricultural page, on
the subject of “Snow Leases!’: —
In reserving this snow country, the Department
has rendered a service to the State, the value of
which will be more fully appreciated in years to
come, when the importance of the region as a tourist
and health ' resort, as a ' timber reserve and as a
‘grazing area has become as widely known as it
deserves to be. Within this area there are still
valuable supplies of such good timber as mountain
ash, messmate, stringy-baric arid. pine. Then, again,
there are upland areas and slopes which
are admirably adapted for fruit farming, market
gardening and dairying, as well as fodder growing;
and, with permanent mountain streams producing an
abundant supply of water, n this natural force might
easily be turned to account as a driving power for
numerous industries. Some progressive in
the mountain country have long since adapted this
driving force for the working of shearing machines,
wool-scouring and chaff-cutting works. It is about
the cheapest power available, and could be used with
enormous effect in connection with numbers of in-
dustries for which this region is eminently suitable
by reason of soil, climate and situation. In fact,
the snow and semi-snow country may be said to repre-
sent a great national resource, which has yet to be
developed, and which under proper economic condi-
tions is bound to become an enormous factor in
the wealth-production of the State.
Just so. And when, a few years back, some
good Australians moved to develop this
“great national resource” by putting the
Federal capital up alongside it, the Herald
refused to see any “resource” thereabouts
to be developed. In fact, in those days the
snow country was a barren wilderness, a
frozen Sahara, and the Dead End and Last
Finish; and Canberra was the Land of
Promise. Has anyone heard of anybody
sending starving stock to graze on the Land
of Promise?
♦
These are the days when the daily paper
hurries up and down this loan-stricken land
looking for signs and symptoms of returning
confidence. Last week Sydney Telegraph
went out to Randwick, gazed upon the people
there assembled, and hatched a three-cheers
paragraph in which it rejoiced as follows :
The fact that 45,000 people attended the opening
of the Spring meeting at Randwick on Saturday would
not suggest that the financial pinch of the war was
being so seriously felt as might have been imagined.
Florse-racing is the most expensive amusement we
have. Not only are the costs of getting on to the
course high,. hut the patrons of the sport have to
bring with them sufficient money to support the ex-
pensive army of bookmakers that live on it. Last
year, no doubt, the attendance was larger, but that
such a vast number are now prepared to purchase a
dky’s sport at so high a price is, in view of all the
circumstances, a solid testimonial to the soundness
of the position.
It is a dubious sort of Foreign-trade argu-
ment. The money that is spent in getting
to the local racecourse helps to swell the
local tramway or railway revenue. It re-
mains in the country. The money that is
staked'on the wrong horse, or with the wrong
bookmaker, remains in the country. It is
just as much available for paying the coun-
try’s local wages as it was before the gamble
happened. The money that leaves the
country, and ceases to be available for pay-
ing the country’s local wages, is that which
goes out for the purchase of imported goods
according to the Telegraph’s Foreign-trade
gospel. When 30s. is sent out of Australia
to pay for on.e shoddy suit it makes Aus-
tralia less able to pay its way than if it had,
in a purely local sense, a Melbourne Cup,
and a bulLfight, and a cock-fight," and a gladi-
atorial show, and an Inquisitorial exhibition
of 10 burned heretics.
The next Minister that Holman will have
to muzzle will be his friend Attorney-General
Hall. ' That small lawyer and smaller
economist carried through the recent busi-
ness of getting a price fixed for wheat, and
at that price collaring a supply which he
didn’t want. Gradually it became evident
not only that the business had been bungled
but that the wheat farmers of Premier
Holman’s and other constituencies had been
stung. So the whole panicky business was
dropped ; and then Hall let his tongue run
loose about it. In plain words, at the time
he seized the wheat he knew, he says, that
the owners could get in the open market
‘ considerably more” than the price he col-
lared it at. Later on the price dropped in
London, which rules the market for Aus-
tralia. “If.” said Hall, “it goes any lower
I might find myself in the position of holding
a large stock which the Government is bound
to pay 4s. 2d. for, but which would not be
worth more than 3s. lOd. or 3s. lid. in the
market.” And, as Hall’s conscience
wouldn’t permit him to pay the farmer 2d.
or 3d. more than market price, though it
had no compunction about compelling him
to accept lOd. or Is. less than market price,
“I am now out of the business,” he says.
After being blocked by the Government from
a good export market, the owners may there-
fore now send the same wheat to a poor
export market —and that’s almost the sum-
total of the Government’s achievement.
Hall has hardly opened his mouth in this
matter without saying that he was going
tc see that people did a fair thine. Whether
he himself did a fair thing in collaring grain
which he now admits was worth considerably
more than he collared it at —in other words,
whether he did a fair thing in taking advan-
tage of an unquestionable blunder made by
the Necessary Commodities Control Com-
mission after an inouiry which was ridicu-
lously superficial— llall may answer for
himself. And being at bottom a fair man
he will feel horribly uncomfortable when he
Las given himself his answer.

What the word “place” is in anti-gambling
legislation the word “ply” is in traffic law.
For years Costs have wrangled over this
latter term in land and water traffic acts,
and a case in chambers before N.S.W. Jus-
tice Ferguson last week revived the uproar.
A tug towing a punt in Port Jackson col-
lided with a ferry-boat and sank her. The
Crown sued the master and owner of the
tug for not carrying a certificated master.
The impeachment was admitted to be cor-
rect, but defendants remarked that as the
tug was not “plying,” and that as only
steamers “plying” had to carry certificated
men, the bottom and the sides fell out of
the Crown’s case and the lid flew skyward.
The magistrate, however, convicted, and the
defendants confidently appealed. For the
first time in history a Judge on appeal
interpreted “ply” in favor of the Crown.
The argument for the appellants was that
“ply” means “to and fro,” and that as the
tug was on an isolated trip, there was no
“to and fro” about it. There was, perhaps,
“to.” and possibly “fro,” but not “to and
fro.” The common-sense Ferguson said
the point was too fine to see and upheld the
conviction. As many harbor steamers not
carrying passengers do not carry certificated
masters, their owners fatuously believing that
their vessels are not “plying,” this decision
will raise a chorus of fury.
Kitchener has given Britain a broad hint
—the hint is about as broad as the distance
from Vladivostock to Petrograd—that the
country will soon be up against compulsory
military' training. The present war, he
reckons, may last three years. Britain sent
a superb army to the front, but it was a
very small army of professional soldiers.
The next one will be larger but less efficient.
A great many of the volunteers who are com-
ing forward have seen service, but they
haven’t been accustomed to work together.
The third army will perhaps be bigger still,
but it will consist of raw enthusiasts picked
up in the street —men who don’t even know
the goose-step, save that they have used it
as a means to jump on a flying omnibus.
Unless the German is cut off short by
famine, through eating his last hog, this will
be a dreary struggle, and compulsory mili-
tary service will arrive in the British Islands
before it is finished. If it had arrived
earlier, and Britain had been able to send
2,000,000 trained men into the middle of the
annoyance, everything might have been
finished by to-day.

“Maraud Safran” :
What a collection of noisy frauds these Orange
patriots are, to be sure! During the many weary
years that the Home Rule agitation has lasted, the
world has been given to understand persistently
that the Ulsterites were going to do something
horrible if ever the Bill became law. Revolution
and civil war in Ireland, and the overthrow of the
Guelph dynasty in England—these were some of the
promised measures of reform, in the event of the
Bill being given the royal assent. The following
letter, which appeared in the wowseristic Man-
chester Guardian, some time ago, was instinct
with the spirit of braggadocio which characterises
the cause:—-
As for the present Royal Family, to tell the
truth, we loyalists of Ulster have little respect for
them....lf we are driven to. it we will let his
Majesty, King George, know what we will do. If
he signs his name to this accursed Bill it will be
fatal for him and his family. Our forefathers had
to call in a William before to defend their rights.
We, their sons, may have to call another William
to defend us from a faithless king and venal,
time-serving, opera-bouife Parliament. P.S. —As you
will see, I have placed the king’s head downwards.
It' will convey to your mind an imperfect idea of
what we really think of him.
The Bill was signed the other day. It found the
Nationalists and Ulsterites tanged 'side by side in
opposition to that Protestant William who was to
have been called in to oust the allegedly-recreant
GfeoRGE. And, last week, Edward Carson, the
leader of the Orange section, announced his party’s
future programme. It will sink the Irish question
during the currency of the war, and afterwards
“agitate by every constitutional means 'for the repeal
of the Bill.” There will be no dethronement, no
civil war, no revolution-. Merely the usual flood of
oratorical blither that accompanies an attack on a
new measure dealing with Ancient Lights or the
Law of Trespass,-or. anything else equally banal. It
is the sort of grotesque anti-climax for which
Orangeism is famous.
Grandma Joins In.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Economist, on the same subject, remarks:
“For this next year, at all events, our savings will
be absorbed by war loans, for which a very high rate
of interest will be charged upon the taxes. Conse-
quently, Canada, Australia, South Africa, India and
the rest of our colonial possessions, will be forced to
rely upon their own resources, and to solve the
problems of bad trade and shrinking exports without
the help of English money for railroads and public
works.” Of course, if we received the guarantee of
the British Government, and made a sort of patriotic
appeal which would not be particularly dignified, we
might get something, more particularly if the Allies
continue their victorious march on the Continent.

The curtain fell, at Sydney Criterion on
Saturday, on the most delightful comedy
seen in Australia for years past, and the
audience, applauding wildly, waited for the
lights to go up. But when the curtain was
drawn back, the audience found, with a gasp
of surprise, that the play wasn’t over. An
unexpected climax had explained the extra-
ordinary and diverting proceedings in the
office of Baldpate Inn in a quite satisfying,
though surprising way; yet the dramatist
had another, and more extraordinary, ex-
planation to offer. What that explanation
is it would be unfair to tell here. A plot so
original, so fantastic, so brilliantly con-
structed, and yet so logically worked out,
should not be divulged except by the drama-
tist. The delight of finding the key to
“Seven Keys to Baldpate” will be left to
the audiences that will undoubtedly crowd to
this genuine diversion. An indication of the
plot is, however, necessary. A manufacturer
of sensational “best-sellers,” undertakes, for
a wager, to write a 10,000-word story within
24 hours. The conditions of the bet make it
necessary for him to fulfil his contract in
the summer hotel, Baldpate, situated on the
top of a lonely mountain, but now, since it
is mid-winter, deserted. Through a snow-
storm the writer arrives. The caretaker,
hurriedly summoned, lets him in and
departs, surrendering to him the only key to
Baldpate. In gossip with the caretaker the
novelist learns that the inn has been the
scene of sensational happenings some years
ago. The scene closes with the novelist
thinking out a possible sensational plot,
which he is evidently about to set in the inn
itself. (This dramatically-difficult “think-
ing” scene is a triumph for Fred Niblo.)
lie retires to his upstairs room, accom-
panied by his trusty typewriting machine.
Then things happen—amazing things, melo-
dramatic things, stolen money, a ghost, an
adventuress, an assortment of “crooks” and
“grafters,” a murder, the police, wholesale
arrests and (at last) the owner of Bald-
pate, who had made the bet, with the key
to the mystery. But, as above mentioned,
the dramatist has another key.
* * * *
The quality of the humor is quite original.
Much of it arises from the delightful situa-
tion of a melodramatic novelist meeting, in
real life, the identical stock characters he
has so often used in his fiction. But even
from the melodramatic happenings the
dramatist is able to. extract comedy. When
before in the record of the stage has been
seen an audience rocking with uncontrollable
laughter at a procession of scoundrels search-
ing for the dead body of a beautiful girl
whom the audience had just seen foully
murdered in their view? The humor lies in
the mere fact that the dead body has disap-
peared, yet the situation is handled in so
masterly a manner by the dramatist, George
M. Cohan, that the comedy element is sus-
tained even in so grim a moment. And the
scene where the villains turn on each other
and each in turn cows his enemy, only in
his turn to be cowed by the next villain, is
a convincing piece of psychology. The use
made by the dramatist, too, of the contrast-
ing value of a slow tempo in a plot of
hurried and bustling happenings, is daring,
yet triumphant. One scene, shows the vil-
lains, compelled to wait all night on a row
of chairs covered by the hero’s re-
volver ; and the whole comedy of this scene
consists of the long periods of silence
between one remark and the next. Of
course these pauses are filled in by the
expressions upon the faces of the silent vic-
tims on the rack of suspense.
* * * #
No fault can be found with the presenta-
tion The scenery, by Leslie Board, is a
triumph of stage realism. No need is there,
nowadays, to commend Fred Niblo. His easy
methods find ample scope as the hero of the
extraordinary adventures of one night.
Josephine Cohan, with the note of pathos in
her somewhat inaudible voice, has no need
to be so sad ; but otherwise she shows her
usual intelligent conception of her parts.
Gwen Burroughs might be a little more
animated, a little more exaggerated, in her
position as the blackmailer. Her represen-
tation is a little out of key with that of
the other possessors of keys to Baldpate.
With regard to the rest, so admirably do
they carry out the meaning of the dramatist
that it is necessary, and only necessary, to
mention their names: Fred Cambourne,
Mrs. Chas. Holloway, Sydney Stirling,
Marion Marcus Clarke, Edwin Lester, E.
L. Delaney, Geo. Bryant, Maurice Dudley,
John de Lacy, E. Pirie Bush.
“The Glad Eye” winked at a full and
merry though perfectly sober audience in-
side Sydney Palace last Saturday. It
appears to be a French farce from which
the poison fangs have been drawn. The
gaps in its moral dentistry are still visible,
but there is no harm in its bite; it is as
innocuous as a violent old dog The Bulle-
tin once lived next door to. Having earned
a bad name, the old hound one day found
himself securely muzzled. Thereafter he
never bit anything but his dinner; but when
he met an enemy he pursued him, got him
down and, using the muzzle like a nutmeg
grater, gave the prostrate dog a severe tick-
ling. A whole lot of dogs in that suburb
died ef laughing. The humor of “The Glad
Eye” is to a large extent the rushing humor
of the moving pictures, but without the mov-
ing pictures’ uncanny silence. The two hus-
bands who have come down before the balloon
in which they didn’t go up supply most of
the moving-picture humor, as well as the
crashes, thuds, hisses and howls that the
lantern and screen cannot reproduce. But
there are occasions when the rest of the co.
swarm into the picture, and then the show
moves so fast that the onlooker sits up and
blinks. The plot isn’t worth mentioning ; but
there is enough of it to go round, and the
final curtain obscures a number of panting
stage-folk whose tongues are hanging out
for liquid refreshments.
* * * *
Miss Ethel Dane, who plays Kiki, giver of
the Glad Eye, is perfect in the part. She
is the exact type of the little French milliner
who is pursued in every number of Le Hire
and similar papers; and she never oversteps
the mark—wherever that may be; the writer
forgets for the moment exactly where it is.
Alice Hamilton (the tall wife who does all
the suspecting for the family) is not a very
convincing actress, but she is good to look
at and knows how to wear clothes. Frank
Bradley dodders naturally in a good make-
up _ as an aged spiritualistic experimenter,
while Ed. Landor has his entertaining
moments as the aged one’s spurious medium.
Tom Shelford and H. .T. Ford, the false-
alarm. balloonists, are brisk and agile young
comedians whose humorous stage wrestle is
worth looking at. The public should find
the Eye a gpod antidote for the tiresome
war.

If “The Ever Open Door” keeps on as it
started, George Willoughby is gofpg to be a
millionaire within a month. Sydney Adelphi on
Saturday night was packed—it couldn’t

house at Show time. There was nothing

special in the play—it was the same old
bellowdrama hashed up in the same way that
bellowdrama has been hashed up ever since
there was such a thing as hash. The only
compelling thing about it was a very large
ice-cream that a very small boy who shared
The Bulletin’s seat ate or licked through-
out Act. 2. By the time the interval arrived
he had flooded the enemy out; so Tiie
Bulletin retreated to the very back of the
gods, where no ice-cream dripped on it, but
where the peanut burst incessantly. Any-
one who hasn’t seen an Adelphi bellowdrama
from the back of the gods has missed a lot.
In the huge theatre the curtain and the
stage appear the size of a lady’s pocket-
handkerchief, but every sound in the place
is magnified 10 times. Every sneeze sounds
like a German 87-inch gun, and it takes the
noyice a while to get accustomed to the deaf-
ening crashes, which are in reality the gods
cracking peanuts, and to the rush of cata-
racts, which turn out to be dripping ice-
cream. It starts soon after the curtain goes
up, and when the act is half over the theatre
sounds like a battlefield; but ammunition
gradually gives out and there is silence by
the end of the act. Then the forces go out
for fresh supplies.

vey the idea that London is a small village
with a population of a few villains in tail
hats, half a dozen starved youngsters, a
handful of drunks, numerous burglars, an
ever-weeping mother and a hero (usually a
parson) ; and the principal industries of the
place are the drowning of heirs and the
search for missing wills. Most of the
inhabitants and their jobs make their re-
appearance in “The Ever Open Door,” and
the only inhabitants who do it any better
than it has been done before are Nellie llol-
royd and Vera Huggett, who represent two
children bewitchingly.

Three Melbourne theatres are changing
the bill next Saturday. Even “Mr. Wu,” at
the Princess’s, is coming off within 14 days
of coming on, partly on account of the war,
no doubt, but partly becapse the story of
that slow, ungodly Chow is brief and
unconvincing. The interview between Wu
and Mr. Greg-o-rie is only a little more fool-
ish, in its revolver business, than the inter-
view of Mr. Wu with Mrs. Greg-o-rie, which
terminates in the cup-of-tea business. . Mon-
golian trappings fail to disguise the ancient
European situations, and every hardened
theatre-goer in the audience must feel that
he or she is being “had.” As for the un-
hardened ones who take Wu and his ven-
geance quite seriously—well, they want more
melodrama for their money. Short plays
for simple citizens have never been in great
demand in this country, as far as the pre-

adapted from the American novel, takes the

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the last
nights of “Gipsy Love” are passing away
in the cold shadow of public neglect. The
melodious opera is dying of comic relief and
general imbecility, aggravated by the fact
that times are bad. On Saturday comes
“Princess Caprice” for six nights only, and a
week later “The Girl in the Taxi” will
arrive.

“Silver King,” at Melbourne Royal, will
send Julius Knight and co. off the
premises with colors flying, for many a
better revival of the old morality play has
done less business. “The Argyle Case,” with
Maggie Moore and Gregan McMahon in the
co., will try its luck on Saturday.

Melbourne King’s, which is subject to
sudden changes of narrative, is now trying
to arouse public interest in “Her Luck in
London,” the old and tarnished story of the
village maiden who seeks giddy experience
even at the villain’s mouth and wins repute
as the houri of “Cupid’s lounge.” Of
course, the damsel is driven to sinful courses
by the usual false accusation and the piety
of her surroundings, and she is further beset
by the characteristic heavy dad and the
faithful comic servitors who pursue her with
the unbridled enthusiasm of a pair of starved
cats trailing a truck of over-ripe fish. More-
over, the bright boots of the bad man are
ever shining in her proximity, and after the
second act a half-dozen smart lads, including
the blindest member of the British aristo-
cracy, infest her doormat and strive to keep
the bell-push in continuous work. In the
end she tires of her crowded life, attaches
herself permanently to the title and income
of the short-sighted noble, and keeps him
happy and contented by never allowing the
voice of Scandal to breathe sultry tidings of
her past in his elegant ear. Miss Olive Wil-
ton runs or pushes herself through the whole
gamut of emotion as the star female; Roland
Conway is the well-born hero; and Rutland
Beckett, Herbert Leigh, George Dawe, C. R.
Stanford, Temple Harrison, and Miss
Gresham interpret the other main characters
—and do it rather languidly, as a rule.
.Beckett and Leigh are the most conspicuous
of the party, while Stanford and Miss
Gresham are the most doleful as the eminent
villain and the heroine’s sister respectively.

Wirths’ circus in the open is a novelty
to Melbourne, and the vastness of the Plaza
Tora, where the annual outbreak now hap-
pens, is, it seems, unrivalled in the Wirthian
line of business. The Plaza Tora occupies
the site of the old “Saucer Track.” A circus
in the middle, with a spacious cage for animal
acts at one end and a square platform at
the other end of the oval enclosure are
surrounded, at a respectful distance, by
roofed and unroofed stands. The wide
margin of the oval is the hippodrome, where
all thipgs and people appertaining to the
circus are paraded. This item on the pro-
gramme is more imposing under the new
open-air conditions than it could be within
the confines of a tent; but the conditions
are at the mercy of the weather, of course.
The Wirths are thus gambling on the ele-
ments. Given a fine, balmy night, the circus
is a seasonable entertainment, some of which
seems somewhat lost in space. On a cold,
stormy night it must necessarily be a sad
instance of misplaced confidence —a circus
chilled to the marrow and quite incapable
of coming in out of the wet.
* * * *
There are 20 or more turns in the pro-
gramme, ranging from time-worn feats in
the arena to the blood-curdling spectacle of
a gentleman diving from a “dizzy height”
on to a dry and dusty chute. Another
gentleman who balances himself ungracefully
upon a shaky pyramid of chairs and tables,
takes an unconscionably long time to do
what is doubtless very difficult and certainly
very absurd; but the acrobats, gymnasts,
and they that trifle with the raging, fiery
steed are rapid in movement and pleasing in
effect. A troupe of Arabs, the Rowlands
Family (whose field of action is a four-
horse drag), the Cadonas, the Hassans and
Madame Berzac (who puts ponies through
their paces on a tricky, revolving platform)
are notable features. The elephants—or
some of them —look larger than ever. Lizzie,
the hippo., is now a bulging five-year-old;
and one of the lady lions has presented her
husband with a bunch of pledges of her
affection.

Melbourne Tivoli supporters relished the
quaint jests and impertinences of A 1 Her-
man, the “Black Laugh,” on Saturday, and
discovered a target for an inexpensive
bouquet in Miss Anna Hana, billed as the
“entertaining American girl.” Herman, who
is never dull, combines the hardihood of a
chestnut-gatherer with the childish cheerful-
ness of the natural-born garrulous coon, who
says more than he means ; whereas the most
noticeable point about Miss Hana’s singing
is a lavish use of the innuendo that means
more than it says. The other newcomer on
Saturday was Miss Naero, a prancer belong-
ing to the De Dio school, who, compared with
the little Russian lady, or even with the
technically-uneducated Maud Allan, is quite
unlettered in the poetry of motion. Miss
Smithson is finishing her season this week,
but George Hall will continue to rend his
shirt in the fury of his grief over the decease
of Gunga Din.

Of the fresh artists at Melbourne Bijou,
The Bulletin speaks with the most
respect, of the Dare Norwoods, whose fine
exposition of hand-balancing has no fuss
or fumbling about it. Williams and Werner,
musicians, display their prowess in a
grotesque and refreshing manner; and Dan
Thomas, a lively comedian who reminds one
of Nat Clifford, has tremendous reserves of
exuberance in his feet. Jock Thomson, a
baritone, warbles Scawtch songs, while Ivy
Moore, a sister of the well-known Carrie,
fails to smudge the family reputation for
vivacity and humor.

_ Adelaide shows do not seem to suffer a
bit from either war or drought, good houses
being the rule all round. Bert Bailey’s co.
at the Royal wanders from U.S. drama to
“Our Selection” and back. It plays all of
them from well to pretty well, even though
it can’t raise an American accent among
the crowd. The variety houses raise plenty,

juggler is as skilful as ever, and still takes
horrid risks with cannon balls. The comedy
aspect of the turn seems to have developed
even more than of old, a long-haired
assistant being the co-conspirator nowadays.
The gymnastic side of the programme is
strong; there is a clever skater who appeals
to his Maker with unnecessary freedom, and
the three Davenport girls, shapely and
(seemingly) very nude, hold their sculptural
poses with unusual skill. The King’s runs
mostly to pairs: Winter and Field, the
Spanish Elvira and Matilda, Benson and
Bell dancing, Andrews and Dent with music,
and so on. The Firefly co. has finished at
the Town Dali, but certain Dandies are
shortly to take up their old open-air pitch.
Charles Reade is lecturing Adelaide on the
improvement of its town-planning. It listens
“without prejudice,” refusing to be convinced
first that any improvement is possible. The

graph has the old “Lights o’ London” well
acted. Tempted by hot weather this co. is
starting its open-air show. West’s have a
highly moral “Million Bid” story, and war
pictures are beginning to flow in to the
Pav. and others.
AT POVERTY POINT.
What Nellie Stewart said: “I can’t keep
away from the stage. I’d been away four
years this time, but I had to come back. I
felt a little uncertain of myself on the first
night, for an act or so of ‘Du Barry’—felt
that perhaps I had lost touch with the gal-
lery, had grown strange to them —so many
new people had been here while I was away.
But I was not in doubt very long. ‘Du
Barry’ is the biggest thing I have done.
‘Sweet Nell’ is easy, compared with it. I
was lucky to get these plays. It isn’t always
possible to find the sort you want. I mean
a play that can be well cast with the people
available. Of course, any players can be
put to act any play. Such a variety of work
is good experience for the young ones. But
the audience—the poor audience ! The second
act of ‘Du Barry’ is the hardest of all.
There are so many changes of mood. The re-
sponse to the appeal of the young lover;
then, to the appeal of the King; the longing
for a simple country life; then, the vision
of power; the momentary wish to return to
the comradeship of the shopgirls and the sol-
diersthe dream of swaying a Court; all
these intermingling and constantly changing.
In comic opera my best work was done in
‘Ma Mie Rosette.’ Rosette is a beautiful
part. For a good, easy part to rattle
through, yet effective, I should say my fav-
orite in comic opera was Bettina in ‘La
Mascotte.’ ”
“Cherub Aloft”: A curious point with
regard to “Who’s the Lady?”—as it was
recently staged at Melbourne Princess’s —
was the fact that Franty Bradley, who
appeared in a leading part, was utterly
unknown to some of the other players until
he stepped on to the stage on the first night.
Some people who had not appeared in “The
Glad Eye” came from Sydney to join the
company for “Who’s the Lady?” They went
through the rehearsals, but Bradley was too
unwell to do so, and his lines were read by
the stage manager. When the critical time
came Bradley and his absolutely new
acquaintances, Esther Mitchell and Tom Til-
ton, acted together as well as if they had been
doing so all their lives.
“Masetto”: Nordica’s estate, reckoned at
about £400,000, didn’t all come in door-
money. A lot of it was the fruit of specula-
tion. Her jewels were assessed at £200,000.
House and land property also figures large,
one item being a £5OOO bungalow, which was
the residence occupied by the soprano and
her fourth and last husband, Mr. Young.
Nordica made a will in Batavia at the end
of last year leaving her property to her
sisters and nothing to Young, as she “had
already given him £80,000.” Romayne Sim-
mons, her strenuous accompanist and secre-
tary, benefits to the extent of £6OOO. How-
ever, Young has possession of another will,
made four years ago, which made him sole
legatee. He states that he will not contest
anything as long as he knows what
really were the last wishes of the
deceased singer, but he denies that he
ever received any big amount from his
wife. On the contrary, he declares
he sent her some £GOOO while she was on her
last tour.. They appear to have been very
friendly; in fact, Young held his wife’s power
of attorney, and was otherwise fully trusted
with her possessions.
From London: Otto Heggie (once of Ad-
elaide) has left for New York, on a well-paid
engagement to “produce” and play the lead
in a Hans Christian Andersen fantasy at the
Park Theatre. Horace Plodges and Wigney
Percival (both in Australia with Wilson
Barrett) are the authors of Cyril Maude’s
big success, “Grumpy.” When Maude goes
to the U.S.A. to play it on a two-years’
engagement, Hodges is to take the name-part
in England. A strong effort has been made
to get the veteran Mrs. Kendal back to the
stage for a “farewell” series, but she declines.
On her last anpearance she l’omped through
the “Merry Wives” with Ellen Terry and
Tree. The revived “Kismet” was going as
strong as ever till the war began, and has
passed the 500 mark. Asche has not yet been
able to show London the “Antony and Cleo-
patra” that Australia saw, and has a Zulu
play marked for his next production. Besides
Tree’s “Drake,” “In the Ranks” and “The
Harbor Lights” are other naval and military
melodramas now come to light again; and
Lewis Waller gets back into harness after
his world’s tour by reciting, at the Empire,
“Henry the Fifth” speeches, Kipling’s “Clam-
pherdown,” and other warlike verse.

Germany, which is now otherwise occu-
pied, developed a craze for puppets last
summer. In Munich, for instance, an
American tourist was alternately bored and
amused by a puppet performance of “The
Lamentable Life and Terrible End of Dr.
Johannes Faustus.” The puppets trod the
stage airily without appearing to touch the
floor, after the fashion of the old-fashioned
heroine who always “trod on air” when the
hero came into view. One foreign critic
remarked rather cruelly, “Would it not be
more endurable, and more fair to the repu-
tation of Pinero, to see his Paula Tan-
queray performed by an inoffensive doll than
bv Olga Nethersole or Mrs. Cn^W?”
“C. Ockney”: “The Silver King,” once
again on the bills with Julius Knight as the
hero, is also having another run in London.
It was revived at the Strand on September 5,
with 11. B. Irving as Denver and Ambrose
Manning as Elijah Coombe, otherwise Father
Christmas. Manning was seen in this charac-
ter at the last revival of the Jones-Herman
classic at Sydney Royal, and a fine, fruity
performance it was. Quite the best given in
Australia, I should imagine, though I admit
I have seen no more than three or four.
Manning is also the producer of the play at
the Strand.

Hoyt's pictures begin to dominate the Mel-
bourne movie business. For several weeks
Hoyt had three shows going—at St. George’s
Hall, the National Amphitheatre and Olym-
pia. Now the old St. George’s Hall is done
with, as the building knackers have got to
work on it to make way for a new Iloyt
theatre, to be erected to the design of Wil-
liam Pitt. Incidentally, there is no such per-
son as Hoyt. When dentist Arthur Russell
launched out in movies he chose “Hoyt” as a
good trade name. It is short and uncommon,
easy to remember, and doesn’t take up space
on advertising matter. Russell struck success
in “Ireland To-day,” the all-Irish picture
show, which he entrusted to the energetic M.
P. Adams. It has kept Adams busy for over
two years, and is still on the road
“Norbell”: What a money-maker “Sweet
Nell of Old Drury” has been for Nellie
Stewart, in almost every town in Austral-
asia ! Three years ago, beginning at the
bottom end of Maoriland, she played the one
piece right through the two islands, then Tas-
mania, Victoria, N. S. Wales and Queens-
land, finishing up in the Gulf country. There
were some queer experiences en route. At
one place a Little Eva kiddie was handed
over the foots bearing the usual “floral tri-
bute.” It was at the climax of the . third
act, where Nell is bearding and wigging
Jeffreys in his lair, and she couldn’t pause in
the action of the scene. As Sweet Nell
stormed around the stage the angel child
trotted after her endeavoring to deliver the
vegetables, until the hand of Fate intervened
and yanked the intruder off. In some of the
little country halls, after the cartwheel hat
and the harpsichord were got on stage, there
was little room for anything or anybody else.
At Coolamon (N.S.W.) King Charles Har-
court Beatty made up in a cowshed and used
Strawberry’s bail for the royal hat-rack. But
that’s nothing. I have seen Imperial Caleb
Porter Nero, Emperor of Rome, using a car-
penter’s bench in a damp cellar for a dressing
table. By the way, Nancye Stewart, the
Lady Olivia of the present production, con-
ducted the' orchestra throughout the tour
mentioned above.
If the weather behaves the Battle of
Flowers will rage furiously on Sydney Agri-
cultural Ground on October 17. The money
goes to the Red Cross treasury, il me
weather misbehaves, the battlers will pro-
bably cpver themselves with umbrellas, and
put their feet in goloshes and rage as furi-
ously as circumstances permit.
“Harrison O.”: In “Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier,” put on in Melbourne by the Reper-
tory Theatre, Arthur Adams evolves several
good situations from a quite unwarrantable
hypothesis. A reporter sees an unmarried
Labor Premier leaving his office at 2 a.m.
with a female. Next day the pressman
announces that the story is already in type,
that efforts are being made to discover the
lady’s name, and that the whole yarn is to
be splashed with big headlines in the great
Liberal daily; while the leader of the Oppo-
sition is going to dilate on the matter in a.
hustings oration. The Premier’s efforts to
frustrate these knavish tricks form the main
incidents of the play. But what great daily,
even though reckoning the inevitable libel
action well lost for a political victory, would
feature such a yarn, and what Opposition
leader (especially a well-bred person such as
Vernon Harrington is represented as being)'
would dream of making it a point in an
election speech? Why, in Victoria there
has been at least one Premier whose houris
were as numerous as his dropped aitches,
but although there was scarcely a journalist
in Melbourne or a man in the House who
could not have spun a dozen yarns anent the
Minister’s giddiness, the yarns remained
unspun. A public man, so long as he is not
actually dragged into the Divorce Court or
fined for being drunk and disorderly, is safe
to romp tvith Bacchus and frivol with Lais
until further orders. Better for him a lost
mace in a bagnio than a citation in divorce.
One of the grounds on which a woman may
secure divorce in N.S.W. is that within a
certain limited time of lodging the petition
her husband has “assaulted and cruelly
beaten’’ her. The phrase has given the
legal mind a fine opportunity for exercise,
with the result that there is a whole library
of conflicting judicial decisions on the mean-
ing of the words. The view generally
accepted, however, is that to get relief the
woman must be both assaulted and cruelly
beaten. If she has been merely assaulted
then she must wait until she has been
cruelly beaten. If cruelly beaten she must
go back to the tormentor and get assaulted.
Should she be merely beaten the Court in-
sists upon a more emphatic walloping. All
of which means that, as the law stands, a
husband who beats his wife with discrimina-
tion can maintain proprietary rights. “Of
course if a man punched his wife on the nose
that would be cruelty,” observed Costs,
K.C., in Sydney Divorce Court the other
day. “I don’t know that it would be, under
this particular section. There must be
assault and a beating—a cruel beating.”
replied Gordon, J. “A mere punch on the
nose might not cause suffering.” So it
comes to this, that unless Fitzjones thumps
Mrs. Fitzjones so heavily as to cause
grievous injury, she can’t get away from him
in legal form until he has made a habit of
it for three years—when the punches may
come under the elastic construction placed
on “legal cruelty” and be considered in the
terms of a different section of the Act. By
that time the lady would probably be dead
or have become so used to Fitzjones’s
habit that it wouldn’t matter.
With Protection admittedly the settled
policy of the country, it has been plain for
a couple of years past that one or other of
the Sydney morning papers would grab the
first handy excuse that offered for adopting
what has evidently become the faith of the
majority of the people. When - the war
broke out everybody who knew much about
newspapers realised that the handy excuse,
had arrived. Which of the two would take
the plunge was, however, in some doubt
until a few days ago, when the Telegraph
allowed its tattered old colors to be refast-
ened up by one of its imported editors. This
cleared the way for the S. M. Herald, which
on Monday announced that circumstances
have “made it necessary for us to seek out a
new theory for tariff development” ; and that
“a new principle might now be conveniently
adopted, having as its basis the need for
solidifying our national existence.” Of
course the “new principle” is the old prin-
ciple that, as far as practicable, Australia
should be made self-contained. “The war
has warned us that were sea communication
effectively interrupted we should be help-
less” ; so the Herald indicates that for the
future it isn’t going to bring offerings to its
old joss, who, it admits, would have “made
our weakness pitiable” had Germany but
owned a few more Emdens, Scharnhorsts
and Gneisenaus. In course of time, when
the Herald gets to know its new joss better,
it will be able to see that, as a result of the
Herald’s old policy, our weakness is already
pitiable. The additional Emdens and
Scharnhorsts would merely have shown the
pitiable weakness up.
Among the battalion of chaplains provided
for the first Australian Contingent there is
one at least who ought not to get in the
way. W. E. Deffer, who goes from Vic-
toria with the 2nd Infantry Brigade, was
at sea as a youngster and got his master’s
ticket before he left the roof of the briny
deep. Most of the time he was kicking
round the African coast —which probably
explains why, when the S’African un-
pleasantness was in progress, he joined
Lumsden’s Horse, and won a medal for
doing a thing which isn’t part of the regular
job of a curate. Deffer’s brother-pilot on
the outgoing ship will be James Green, a
hardshell Methodist who writes a line now
and then for the S. M. Herald.
Two well-known Australians were found
in a cellar at Antwerp—Louise Mack (Mrs.
Creed) and Frank Fox, both at one time of
this paper. So The Bulletin wasn’t badly
represented amid the excitement. The pair
were toiling for London papers when the
storm overtook them. Doubtless cellars
were at a premium on the fourth day of
calamity, when the retreat blocked the exits
from the city. It isn’t mentioned how many
people were sheltering in that particular
stone hole, but 40 is a fair guess.
The war is said to have obliterated old
King Charles of Roumania. He was of
German descent, like Ferdinand of Bulgaria,
and Albert of Belgium, and the temporary
William of Albania, and George V. of Brit-
ain—in fact, Germany has so many royal-
ties that it supplies kings to almost all
Europe. But Charles took his German
descent seriously. He was a Hohenzollern,
and, came of an older branch than that to
which Kaiser William belongs. His heredi-
tary bird’s-nest was on the top bough,
while that of* William is among the grubs
at the root. If Kaiser William was hanged
and all his family disqualified, Charles of
Roumania might have inherited the imperial
crown and the mailed fist. But his Minis-
ters had no sympathy with his idea of
throwing in the weight of Roumania on the
German side of the war, and apparently
Charles, at the age of 75, died from senile'
disappointment, or croup, or being brought;
up on the bottle, or something.
A SONG OF SIN.
(Some rhymed and rude remarks suit able for all
times and occasions .)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once again that wave of Wickedness is sweeping o’er
the earth—
Oh, it splashes in our sorrow, it is mingled with
our mirth.
And the Devil walks beside us—walks wherever we
may go—
But (I blush not to confess it) he’s a pleasant chap
to know!
Never maiden on the beaches her angelic form has
shown
But the Devil woos and wins her in a manner all
his own.
Never does she wet her tresses in the ocean's salty
rim
But he’s smirking there beside her—having learnt to
surf and swim !
He’s the limit of persistence is the Devil of to-day;
He is with us at our labor, and he joins us in our
Play;
In the skating rink you’ll find him, and he never
falls or halts ;
And he dances most divinely from the tango to the
waltz.
He’s a most impartial Devil; in the daylight and
the dark
You’ll find him all-insistent in the parlor or the
paik.
When we do the Block at night-time in our tailor’s
latest pride
You can bet your earthly prospects he is walking
by our side!
He is opposite at dinner, aye, and when we go to bed
He balances expertly on the brasswork at our head.
And he leers - from out our paper, he is there on
ev’ry page—
And I thank the gods that gave us such a cheery
heritage 1
Yes (again my phiz is blushless), I confess I like
him well;
For he fills my heart with gladness that no con-
science can dispel.
Aye, and if his horns were not devised to hang a
Bermon on,
Oh! the cleric’s occupation, like Othello’s, would be
gone!

“Stripey”: When Senator Pearce decided
to abolish the “wet” canteen in the camps
of the expeditionary forces, for the reason
that he “did not think the ‘wet’ canteen
was according to the spirit of the Defence
Act,” he was evidently dead-broke for an
argument to justify the prohibition. The
regulation abolishing the “wet.” canteen was
designed solely to remove temptation from
young trainees. But there are none of these
lads in the present camps, and to thrust the
same regulation upon grown men who are
working overtime to learn how to fight for
their country is going to introduce sly drink-
ing, which, indeed, has not been unknown in
the alleged “dry” camps of the past. Per-
sonal experience of many military camps has
proved to me that liquor has never inter-
fered with discipline, and that the conduct
of the troops depends entirely upon the offi-
cers commanding. Military work is at
times of the very hardest, especially where
there are horses to attend to, and the meagre-
ness of the mess is often poorly compensated
by a refreshing glass of beer. Pearce’s re-
enforcement of the regulation seems to have
been prompted by the swarm of temperance
bees that have been buzzing round his bonnet
since a few of the volunteers have been found
more or less anyhow in the streets, owing
chiefly to their many friends insisting on
“just-one-for-luck-before-you-go” ; which is a
matter that reflects on the archbishop, or the
new curate, rather than on the well-con-
ducted military canteen. Has anybody, by
the way, heard of any tremendous rush of
noisy prohibitionists to enlist —a matter
which is of a little more moment just at
present?

Adelaide is engaged in a feverish hunt
for water. It has plenty for present neces-
sities ; but the supply is perilously short, and
these are but the first days of summer. So
the use of tap-water for gardening has been
forbidden, and the- whole suburban popula-
tion seems to be sinking bores. The results,
so far, are just a gamble. Some get good
water at 30 feet. Some get none at all at
300. Some get a mere soakage that soon
pumps dry, and others a copjous flow too
salt to be of use. The whole Adelaide plain
is on clear evidence an ancient sea-bed.
There is an idea of tapping the Barossa
supply, but that district is likely to need all
it has. There is even wild talk about some-
how bringing the Murray over the hills in-
tervening. Meanwhile the simple inch of
rain which Sydney could spare gladly seems
to South Australians a miracle past hoping
for.
HER REASON.
MISTRESS: “ But why do you give me notice? Isn’t this a good situation, and haven't

MARY ANN: “No, mum. Fact is, I can't find no young man in these parts.”
About the hardest man to find these days
is a contented shareholder in the wonderful
firm of J. Earle Hermann, Limited, of Syd-
ney. One by one they pour into the courts
to say that they were infants or lunatics
or absentees, or under duress, or something
of the sort, when they were put on the
register ; that they never paid for the shares;
that they didn’t want the shares ; that they
got no dividends from the shares ; that they
have no money wherewith to pay calls; and
that all they desire is peace and release.
If the newspaper space wasn’t so much occu j
pied with war news, the Earle Hermann
joke—it really seems to be only a
would be a fortune to the daily press.
“Petifi”: If there is anything in the
recent cable from Paris that'half the deaths
in the military hospitals from wounds
received in the trenches are due to tetanus,
it looks as if Tommy and Francois are
getting a cruel wallop from the Dead Hand.
The tetanus (lock-jaw) germ is very much
at home in stable manuTe, and that’s one
reason why you might bump him any Satur-
day afternoon in well-nourished garden
mould. He enters the human body by way
of some flesh wound, and, once there, he’s
generally there to stay. Now, the French
battlefields have been a long time occupied ;
countless generations of men have lived above
them and manured them and tilled them,
and scores of the trenches must be sunk
through mould nourished'by the Dead Hand)
during a heap of centuries. Just the sort
of place where you might expect to bump
brother Tetanus, and likely enough Tommy
and Francois, his mate, are bumping him —
or he is bumping them.

“The .Oldest Inhabitant”: The Sydney)
Anglican Syiyid has been asked by one of
its archdeacons to recognise the first Sunday,
in February as the anniversary of the
earliest Australian sermon —-preached by.
parson Johnson on the arrival of the First:
Fleet. The anniversary has always been 1
kept on the first Sunday after January 26f
The fleet anchored in Sydney Cove on
Saturday afternoon, January 26, 1788, and
churchmen have assumed that the parson
rushed, his flock to shore on the following
morning and held a preachment. They
didn’t know Governor Phillip. He wasn’t
the godly man who was likely to interrupt
the landing of his “subjects” and the forma-
tion of the camp to allow any. parson to
preach. As a fact, the diary of Dr. Bowes-
gives the date of the first service’ as Febru-
ary 3. .
The .“slinker slouch” style of gait, and
pose which was the latest affectation of Bri-
tain’s uppah middle-class girl before the
war began (the war probably has put it out
of her head and legs) seems to have been
merely a revival of the old aesthetic,, flop
adapted to hobble-skirted conditions. The
dainosels in Burne Jones and Rosetti. pic-
tures have the “slinker” pose, which is
achieved by so bending the off-liind leg that
the knee is slightly in advance of its fellow
and the foot sticks out in the rear, heel up-
wards.
The toughest proposition the Australian
Expeditionary force .struck in New Britain
wasn’t Kaiser Bill’s white emissaries, 'or his
Benches, mines and other European in-
fernal machinery. It was just plain riigger
up a tree. The native policeman hid him-
self—or his German officers hid him—in the
thick foliage of the jungle’ palms, and thence
he “sniped” the oncoming Australian's’'to hiss
soul’s content. To find him- —his “smokeless
powder 'gave no clue —was a tougher: job
than picking winners at Randwick when
Moses has a■' day out. Incidentally, 1 the
Kaiser’s officer showed that he can be a
cool customer in a hot shop. One' qf‘ him
had his hand shattered by a bullet, and,
. declining chloroform, , sucked a cigarette
while I>r. 'POckley (killed a littlq later)
amputated ’ the remains. “I can’t finder-
stand why my mine didn’t explode,” was his
only comment on the situation,
EIGHT HOURS DAY AND THE WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As a result of the war Australia lias very pro-
bably to face an expenditure of £2,000,000 or
more. —News item.
Eight-Hours Da}' was celebrated in Sydney. The
weather was perfect for the holiday.— Ditto.
The day is bright, the streets are clear,
And everyone seems gay;
Life is all muslin, flags and beer,
And baskets bar the way.
One treads on children everywhere,
And shoulders Sunday clothes;
Young flannelled fools with maidens fair
Loiter in rings and rows.
To ev’rv well-scrubbed, sunny deck
Fresh hundreds gaily mount.
Yes, Work has got it in the neck,
And has to take the count.
The factory chimneys belch no smoke,
The market stands and dreams ;
Only the humble Dago bloke
Sells sodas and ice-creams.
Dark Italy with fruit in heaps,
And Greece with crayfish red,
Work on, while young Australia leaps
Around the dancing shed.
The dance pianos ring and thump
By many a harbor reach,
And workers in the breakers jump,
Or chase girls on the beach.
Who cares for European war?
Tell us what we’ve to pay,
And we will owe a little more,
For that’s our youthful way.
Don’t interrupt us and don’t fret! ’ ’
We won’t pay if you whine!
Call round to-morrow and you'll get
Our lOU at nine.
The war goes seven days a week—
But that is not our way!
Though empires crash, and pawnshops leak,
And maddened Cohens writhe and shriek,
We’ll take our Eight-Hours Day !
Ilooray !
Our grand old Eight-Hours Day!

Until he has charged the Kaiser.
For a new-wiped joint and a leaky tap
He charged sixteen and eleven ;
His charge of the Kaiser—lucky hap !

The problem of how to make £75 per
annum without working has been solved by
Bertha Mary Backhouse, of Woodend
(Vie.). Bertha simply registered the arrival
of a fictitious infant, received a certificate
of birth, and promptly posted the document
to the baby bonus headquarters, together
with a claim signed by an apparently gen-
uine mother and midwife. Thereupon the
maternity bonus department paid out £5 to
Bertha. Fifteen times last year did the
astute lady replenish her purse in this way.
Then the officials became suspicious of the
similarity in the writing of the alleged
mothers, made inquiries, and, as a result,
Bertha appeared before Judge Eagleson. Her
defending counsel pleaded for leniency on
account of her consumptive husband and
one genuine infant; and the Judge, after
passing a few remarks on the laxity of the
Department in not investigating claims, in-
vited the culprit to come up for sentence
when called upon. Which means, “Go and
be found out no more.’”

“Croson” watches the Drought come to
town:—
In my suburb, on the outskirts of Melbourne, I can
sit and watch the Drought come to town. For a
month mobs of starving stock have been on the move,
passing from the north and north-west towards Gipps-
land and a bite of pasture. Sometimes the trek was
too long delayed. I saw 40 dead cows being carted
to a bonemill one morning. In some cases the settler
has been driven out holus bolus. A youth on a lean
horse urges the stock along by-roads and back tracks;
at the tail of the procession dad and the family
follow in a dray or an open waggon with a cover of
bags fixed atop and a footsore dog beneath. Things
are dry enough round Melbourne, but they say the
land is an emerald paradise compared with the Hell
they left up north.
TTHE WORLD , THE FLESH AND THE D-!
THE W ORLD: "Good Lord! My wife's curate!”
The inventive bump of the Maorilander
quickly developed in camp. One of the
machine-gun sections didn’t like the stan-
dard method of mounting the Maxims on
their tripod. So a few of the men got to
work in their spare time .and devised a new
way. The old system consists of passing a
bolt or a pin through holes in the standard,
and the operation is slow and dangerous.
mi tvr -i -t, „ „i i,:_j r.f
The Maorilanders made a special land of
clamped bearing, With which the gun could
be adjusted very quickly and without expos-
ing the operator. The thing gave splendid
results under service conditions. Another
improvement made is a* new kind of pack-
saddle for carrying the gun. It holds the
weapon clear of the horse, gives a more even
distribution of the load, and the gun can be
more quickly detached for use. An English
officer who lias seen plenty of war says the
clamped mounting is what the army has
been looking for for years, and all the
Maxims from Maoriland have now been
lifted with it.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes :—•
I can tell all about the slump in business since
the war started by the Feet. I live in Mosman
(Sydney), near the wharf, and on the edge of a
district where the cheap but picturesque cottages
and little villas stand close together. These are in-
habited, to a great extent, by clerks, shop and ware-
house people, and, in general, by the better class of
the wage-earning commercial folk. My bedroom
window faces the front, and I am a bad sleeper
these days. At the preface of dawn I am wakened
by the crow of the milk-cart and the ungreased
wheels of the rooster. Then I listen (or used to
listen) to the torrent of Feet.
First there was the early contingent which started
work at 7.30. Next there was the larger 8 o’clock
contingent. I know the clatter cf innumerable
girls; there are a hundred of them to whom I
could swear in a court of law if I heard the echo
of their heels —though I have never seen one of
them. The 9 o’clock contingent passes (or used to
pass) by while I am in the dead waste and centre
of the breakfast sausage. I go over with the
loafing push which tries to reach its office about
9.45.
Most of these remarks, as already mentioned,
apply to the past. I am still aroused by the crow
of the milk-cart and the ungreased wheels of the
rooster, but the rooster appears to have greatly
diminished. (So has the morning paper which is
boomeranged over my fence.) The 7.30 crowd is
still a fairly strong force. The 8 o’clock multitude
is reduced to less than half its old strength. The
pair of boots which I mentally christened Mary
Smitli no longer goes past. I suppose Mary has lost
her job. The hoofgear of Charlotte Jones do not
take their accustomed way, nor those of Sarah Bill-
ingsley. The 9 o’clock rush, which is mostly
male, has evaporated like a morning mist.
My own boat isn’t so full as it used to be. Out
o»' curiosity I took an early craft one morning—
that is to say, I travelled by the good ship Previous
instead of by the Subsequent. Our company has
only two boats—the Previous, which I just miss, and
the Subsequent, which I capture after long waiting.
I found most of my missing acquaintances on board
the Previous. Apparently 20 or 50 of the 8 o’clock
push have lost their jobs in the average importing
warehouse, and the 9.45 potentate is now reduced
to the 8 o’clock or 8.30 degradation, and goes in
early to look after the .remnant of the undertakings.
It makes me feel, sorry. I miss the high heels of
Mary Smith-—who is a nice girl, though 1 1 never
met her—on the early morning footpath. I miss
the martial stride of Charlotte Jones and the con-
fident tread of Sarah Billingsley. I don’t know
either Charlotte or Sarah from a crow, but I was
on friendly terms with their feet. It seems to me
that a country which borrowed less and imported
less and manufactured more wouldn’t need to bounce
these deserving maidens simply because there has
been, for two months or so, an untidy scrap at the
other end of the world.
When the blessed restoration of confidence comes
about I will know it well ahead of the newspapers.
I will know it by the sound of early boots on the
pavement. I hope Mary Smith will get her job
back, likewise Charlotte Jones and Sarah Billingsley.
But I am especially anxious about Mary Smith. Her
feet were music.
Wise words from London: —
Of the various funds started here in connection
with the war, that kicked off by the Prince of Wales
is the most fashionable, and has already reached over
a million and a half. Cheylesmore, Baron and Major-
General—he used to command the Grenadier Guards
•—has struck in with the sensible suggestion that some
of this big money should be set aside for use at the
end_ of_ the war to benefit disabled fighters. At the
beginning, he says, enthusiasm runs high, money
flows in> and in the plethora thousands of p 0 ’ unds a / e
thrown away upon unnecessary fripperies and over-
lapping schemes. But when the war is over “apathy
and indifference succeed enthusiasm and generosity,
the widows are penniless, and human wrecks eke out a
miserable existence on totally inadequate pensions.''
Cheylesmore adds that he knows scores of men who
fought in the Boer war, for whom, his pergonal ex-
perience proves, it is useless to make any appeal. The
war is over, and gone is the glamor and the heart-
throb. Is Australia putting anything by for the
crippled wreck? Or is it merely rushing up vast
quantities of clothing that will never be worn, and
providing alleged “comforts” that will be merely
jettisoned as lumber at the first opportunity?
CONFIDENCES.
“Is your husband hard to please?”
“I really couldn't tell you. I never tried."
“Shellback” : In every State in Australia
you can find a small regiment of seafaring
men who to-day are chiefly engaged in jump-
ing on their hats and hitting themselves with
marling-spikes. These are the sailormen
who expected to be made Director of Navi-
gation, or, failing that, to get some other
good job under the Federal Navigation Act.
In 1913 Joe Cook promised to bring the Act
into force at an early date, and the crowd
looking for billets haunted the offices of
Liberal Ministers, and badgered Liberal poli-
ticians to further their claims. They were
all confident that Joe Cook was coming back,
and they, to a man, plumped on the chance.
Leading citizens of great tonnage pulled
all sorts of wires in the interests of their
pals, each of whom, of course, was ticketed
as antagonistic to Labor principles and
utterly opposed to the union element, which
is so pernicious to the interests of ship-
owners. Now all these calculations have
gone overboard, and applications and testi-
monials are being coldly investigated by a
Labor Minister with a cod-fish eye. If
there’s one thing more discouraging than
another in the circumstances it is a Minister
with a cod-fish eye.
The best war news this week was the
four-line cable which told that the Russian
army from Warsaw, 1,000,000 strong, was
within 30 miles of the German fortress of
Thorn. It looks as though Rennenkampf’s
retirement from Eastern Prussia was a well-
laid trap. The Germans followed him into
the Baltic Provinces. Now he has hurled
them back into Eastern Prussia, and the
whole force stands a very good chance of
being caught between his force in Eastern
Prussia and the Warsaw army in Western
Prussia. Only about the quickest retreat
in history can save it. When Rennenkampf
links up with the Warsaw army around
Thorn, Russia will have 1,600,000 men within
220 miles of Berlin, with another Inilliou
threatening Cracow, and liable to march
stiaight on Vienna, 160 miles away, or
turn northward and lay waste the wheat
fields of Silesia. Anyhow, unless the Ger-
mans can win a decisive battle around
Thorn, all Eastern Prussia, 14,329 square
miles of the Fatherland, the Kaiser’s own
beloved province, will have to be abandoned
at one jump. And then with nearly
3,000,000 Russians within striking distance
of the capital, and with the home of Junker-
dom under the Russian heel, the agony of
Germany will begin.
“D.”: The illustrated papers
are beginning to come to hand
from Europe, and it is signifi-
cant to notice the way the
different nations took their
mobilisation orders. The French
are almost uniformly sad. The
men look gloomy; the women
weep on their shoulders. The
Germans face the camera with
the confident mien of men who
feel that they have the Indian
sign over their adversaries. The
British treat the affair as a
pleasant excursion. One finds
only laughing faces in the pic-
tures of the men at Boulogne.
Is this real valor, or the valor of
ignorance'/ The latter, I think.
Just so did Napoleon’s army
laugh when it started on its
fatal journey to Moscow. War
on the modern scale is a thing
to be faced with gravity. The
French are sad because they
have tasted its bitterness. The
British laugh because they have
known nothing but picnic war-
fare for a century. It is not
likely that any of the millions
who are engaged slaughtering
each other at the present time,
or their dependents, will ever
again smile at the prospect of a
war. What a hideous example
the 20th century has set the
world, in this respect, by the
way!. In its first 14 years it
has known the Boer war, the
liusso-Jap war, a bloody cam-
paign waged by Italy, a series
of uprisings in the Balkans, cul-
minating in a wild-cat struggle
in which all the Balkan States,
barring Roumania, were in-
volved, several wars in Turkey,
a big disturbance in Mexico,
and now the present horror.

From “The Oldest Inhabitant
It is suggested in Melbourne that the names of
Heidelberg, Brunswick and Coburg should be changed
and English or Australian monikers substituted.
Those who propose suer, things tread on dangerous
ground. For instance, Brunswick was named, not
after the German principality, but after Captain
George Brunswick Smythe, of the 50th llegiment, one
of the earliest military men in Port Phillip. Coburg
got its name during the visit of the Duke of Edin-
burgh. Father O’Hea was tired of being told that
most of his parishioners were “in Pentridge.” So
he suggested “Coburg,” as the Duke of Edinburgh
was heir to that dukedom —to which, by the way,
he succeeded. Thus Brunswick is named after a
British officer and Coburg after the late Queen Vic-
toria’s son.

This water contains more lithia than any of
the European Spa Waters, except that from the
Murquelle, at Barlen Baden, which contains lithia
as chloride, and it is also much richer in car-
bonate of sodium, though Birresborn, in Prussia
and Bilin, in Bohemia, approach it.
This water would he used as an antacid and
diuretic, the latter effect being due to the lithia.
1 remain, yours truly,
WILL A. DIXON, f.i.c., f.c.s.
We now give an explanation of the
virtues of some of the salts which the
water holds in solution :
Bicarbonate of Lithia. —An alka-
line which has solvent powers on Uric
Acid, forming with it a soluble salt, thus
destroying concretions. Purifies the
blood through the kidneys.
Carbonate of Sodium. —For gouty
and uric acid _ diathesis. Assists the
action of the biliary organs, checks food
fermentation.
Chloride of Sodium. —A gentle stimu-
lant to the liver and secretions. In-
creases the action of the skin, promoting
perspiration.
In conclusion, we briefly submit that the con-
sumption of Helidon Spa gives health and com-
tort to all who use it. Indigestion is instantly
removed, restlessness gives way to a calm feeling
of tranquillity, a refreshing sleep is often in-
duced, feverish thirst is allayed at once, and
when the water is taken with milk in the morn-
ing, a marked improvement in health will follow
It. must be remembered that no water hitherto
discovered is so retentive of carbonic acid gas
which makes its persistent and sparkling efferves-
cence more agreeable to the palate, and also
more grateful to the stomach.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Offsider” : The way these N. S. Wales
politicians talk about dropping 1 in seed for another
million or two acres of wheat-crop next year makes
me jump. “We have the land,” says one triumphant
city paper, “much of it being still under timber, but
only waiting to be cleared to become arable.”
Apparently this Hyde Park agriculturist reckons you
go out in the morning and chop down your tree,
and in the afternoon you yoke Bluey and Maud
in to the plough, and start to make 10,000 blades
grow where only one box or pine grew before. Alas
(and alack, too, for the matter of that), it isn’t so
simple. If you can get a crop off green-timber
country in three years after “ringing” (which Hyde
Park calls ringbarking, but we’re too busy), you do
remarkably well. Of course, I’m not talking about
mallee. That’s not timber—it’s scrub. And, any-
how, there isn’t much mallee wheat country in N. S.
Wales. What is left in the West to clear is chiefly
box and pine; and, by the way, we’ll be sorry
presently for sinfully wasting the pine as we are
doing.
“Lango-Namo”: Of the several theories
advanced by the Papuans to account for the presence
of cocoanuts there, 1 accept the one herewith as being!
the most feasible. Away back toward the Commence-
ment of Things there was a man belonging to one of
the coastal villages who would never allow other
natives to accompany him on fishing expeditions. As
he was invariably successful, many tried to spy on
him. None succeeded, however, until his whiskers
had grown down to his knees, and become hoary and
tattered with age. Then a young man followed him
and watched the magic. All about, the sea was
literally alive with fish. The fisherman was swelling
to gigantic proportions.. Suddenly he caught his head
with both hands, lifted it off, and put it carefully
aside on the beach. Then he walked down into the
sea (taking care to draw a deep guiding line from
his head, so that he’d be able to locate it again) until
the water was over his neck. His arms were raised
Unee times in rapid succession, and instantaneously
he became the vortex of a seething whirlpool of
water. The boy ashore was transfixed with terror.
Then Methuselah, or whoever he was, shot his arms
up thrice and the whirlpool stopped .just as suddenly
as it started. The magician waded back to the
beach, followed the mark he had drawn down the
sand, until he arrived at his head, where he stood
upside down on his hands till he'd emptied all the
water and fish out (during this inverted period he
shrank by degrees to his former dimensions). Then
he calmly re-attached his top-piece, and returned to
the village with his load of fish. When the boy who
had seen these wonderful things returned he put the
old cove s pot on. At next fishing the whole village
managed to get orchestra stalls, and when the per-
former detached his top-piece they induced (he
youth to appropriate it and bury it in the bush.
When Methuselah came ashore and discovered the
robbery he threw back somersaults until he plonked
into the sea, where he was transformed into a marine
serpent, and was,never seen again. The next time the
daring youth passed that way lie found a graceful
palm growing out of the head he had buried. He
took one of the nuts home with him, and persuaded
his grandmother to sample it. It worked such a
wonderful change in her that everyone clamored for
some of the new food; and ever since the natives
have cultivated it. If you doubt this story just look
at a husked cocoanut, and you’ll see the two eves
and the mouth of Methuselah whose head it once was.

“Y.Z.”; Are the snake and the rahbit
fraternising? At Wangaratta (Vic.) the other day a
black snake (a very early riser, by (lie way) darted
out of a rabbit burrow and bit the chin of a small
boy, who had just sent a ferret in on a voyage of
discovery. Last year a friend of mine in Eastern
Gippsland was bitten by a snake when putting his
hand into a hollow log to haul out a rabbit, and a
relative on the land discovered a pair of rabbits,
seven “kittens” and a large snake in affectionate
relationship in the same stump. These are only a few
instances out of a score not more than two years
old, which seem to imply that old Serpent and John
Bunny are making common cause. I can see that
old Serpent as a protection would be of some benefit
to Bunny, but where does Serpent profit, unless it is
that he is content to act as guardian of the burrow
for the sake of cheap and comfortable lodgings?
PAINFUL TO BOTH.
"It's quite a painful subject for me to ask a
man for a loan; but could ”
“It affects me the same, old chap. Don't let
us discuss it!"
“Pick” : The confidence business flourishes
in this country as of yore. In frequent city and
country papers advertisements appear offering to pro-
vide to any person with a desire to get rich
hurriedly a rabbiter’s equipment—horse, vehicle, tent
and traps, and the right to enter private rabbit-
infested lands at Whatsup or Takemedown or some
other old place in the State for the mere sum of
£2O or thereabouts. In case the purchaser doesn’t
know, the sportive and easy life of the trapper is
glowingly portrayed, and an assurance is given that
any pair of energetic mates, with the turn-out and
country offered, may earn £7, or anything upwards,
per week. Such an advt. lately offered the enclosed
lands around Lake George as the happy hunting
ground. As an added inducement the splendid wild-
duck shooting and fishing that the lake affords was
referred to, although the duck season is closed down
and Lake George is a dry and dusty plain whereon
ducks and fish are as scarce as German Dreadnoughts.
Nevertheless, within one week I met three parties
(two of them newchum English) who had been
allured by the advt., and had parted up £25 for
the ramshackle turn-out which they would have sold
to me for the price of their railway fares back to
Sydney. In the winter of 1913, when the rabbit
industry boomed until it burst by glutting the
market, experienced trappers on favorable country
might have earned £3 10s. per week, but since then
the best trappers have had to yakker hard for
undressed crust, and all but the best have turned the
game up as unprofitable. Also, since the outbreak
of the European disturbance, when skins fell from
19d. to nothing per lb., only the freezing works’
suppliers are on the job, and if the threatened stop-
page of overseas export of food supplies comes about
the freezing works all over the States will close
down I therefore vote that all rabbit-equipment
advertisements be strictly censored.
A MATTER OF PHILOLOGY.
EMINENT PUGILIST (to his manager): “ Why are you putting such big words in that
challenge?”
M ANAGER: "Because they are jaw-breakers! ” (The explanation was quite satisfactory.)
"I*. Purplestraw”: When The Bulletin
lias cured Australians of the Ijad habit of referring
to the North as the East, I want it to cure those
officials and others who always refer to dry weather
as fine. If it thinks they ought’ to be killed I don’t
mind. I live in a place where this year there hasn't
been rain enough to wet flour for a damper.
We’ve been threatened 57 tiniest and the crops have
held up their heads and begged for a drop ; but every
time the clouds have packed their bluey and cleared
out along the track. I’ve a neighbor who has a
mortgage and eight youngsters, and didn’t get enough
harvest last year to pay his store bill. The store’s
shut now, so far as he is concerned ; and he and the
missus and most of the eight kids are living on a bit
of flour they happened to have, mixed with bran,
with rabbits for meat. They have had butcher's
meat only twice in a month. And he has got to pull
through—and pull them through—for another 15
months somehow. It will be that long before he
can reap a harvest. Forty-eight hours after the Broken
Hill miners, who had been getting sometimes a pound
a day, were thrown out of a job, they were howling
for State relief ; and they got it, too. But that has
nothing to do with this “fine” weather, which
has driven my neighbor and the, mortgage and the
kids to a diet of rabbits. Somebody who lived in a
place where there’s a drizzle 210 days a year and a
fog the other 150-odd reckoned that when it wasn’t
drizzling it was “fine.” .So the backblocks Aus-
tralian, when he wants rain worse than anything in
the world, borrows a paper that he can't afford to
buy and reads with bitterness that the weather
threatens to go on being “fine” ; or, maybe, it is
going to be “cloudy” in some parts, but “fine” in
his part; and then he knows that, if the forecast
comes true, the “fine” weather is going to be the
foulest that a mysterious Providence could possibly
pick out of a basketful. Will the officials please cut
it out of their vocabulary. We’ve enough to put
up with without having this borak poked at us.

“Silas Snell” : “I distrust a bloke wliat’s
showin’ too cheerful,” said One-Finger Bill, He was
a small, scrubby man, with a small swag and a
scrubby, small dog, and at some stage in his career
the cogs of a harvester had stripped three fingers
and a thumb from his left hand, but he seemed cheer-
ful enough to excite his own suspicion. Perhaps it
was the beer. “I remember,” he said, “pickin’ up
a feller name iv Draper near Kingpin one day. He
strayed up where I was campin’ fer crib ’n’ grillin’
some chops on a bit of Angel’s fenein’-wire, ’n’ in-
vited hisself to lunch. He put in a half a billy iv
good beer ’n’ a scone loaf a woman had give him,
’n’, by gosh, he was the most cheerfullest talker ’n’
entertaineriest feller I ever met. He could sing a
bit, too, ’n’ play the wire fence. Ever heard a feller
play on a wire fence? This one could play ‘Work,
Boys, Work,’, ’n’ heaps o' toons on a wire fence ez
good ez one o’ them orchestras. I took to Draper, ’n’
we limped along together, him tollin’ me his adven-
tures, ’n’ how he lost his missus ’n’ two kids in a
fire, ’n’ how his mother ’n’ two brothers died in one
year. At a pub in Little Bridge he shook a length
of rope, sayin’ a rope might come in handy if a
bloke wanted to steal a horse. That man was chock-
full o’ jokes, ’n’ I couldn’t get along coz he kep’
me laughin’ fit t’ bust. We camped under the Piper
bridge that night, ’n’ he cooked flapjacks in an old
shovel-blade fit fer a king, and after supper he
showed me six card tricks, ’n’ sang three songs.
Well, ye’ll guess what good company he was when
I tell yeh I’d come seven mile out o’ me way t’ be
with him. We went to sleep under the Piper bridge,
with our feet to the fire, ’n’ I never opened an eye
till seven o'clock nex’ mornin’. ’N’ the first thing
I see when I did open me eyes was Draper hangin’ be
the neck from a girder of the bridge not two foot
from me nose, dead ez a herring. He’d committed
sooicide. That’s what be brought the rope fer. He
left a note tellin’ me to inform the police. That’s
what he brought me fer.”
O.” : Nowhere is one liable to hear so many
unreliable stories about the early days of Australia
as along the course of the Hawkesbury, especially
in the neighborhood of Windsor. Parramatta has
much to distinguish it in this respect, but there is
a religious serenity about the good Munchausens of the
Hawkesbury that would throw’ a police-court lawyer
off his guard. The ltev. D’Arcy Irvine, Archdeacon,
in the preface to the fourth edition of his little
book of verses, just published in England, is the
latest to tell how he was got at by the long-faced
natives. He had written about Windsor:—
. “And here the Governor,
Macquarie, built his simple country home
And you may see it now, a lowlv place,
A cottage of few rooms, of plastered walls,
\\ ith low verandah looking out upon
The Court-house and the willow-fringed creek.
And here for many weeks in every year
Macquarie lived and cared for men,-and had
A lively sympathy with those who toiled—•
The hardy pioneers of this fair land.”
But, the fact is, Governor Macquarie did not build
that old house at all. It was built by Governor
Hunter, a dozen years before. Macquarie saw Aus-
tralia. Evidence is complete on that point, and
the Archdeacon, probably not liking to disturb the
order of his graphic lines, lays about him in his
preface. He says he was rector of St. Matthew’s,
Windsor, from 1890 to 1893, and that the statements
he has . made concerning Macquarie he had derived
from several of the oldest inhabitants. The oldest
inhabitants ought to die young.
DAWGS OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Comes the British bulldog first — : solid as a log—
He's so ugly in repose that he’s a handsome dog;
Full of mild benevolence as his years increase ;
Silent as a china dog on the mantelpiece.
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and in he goes.
To the thick of Britain’s foes —
Enemies behind him close- —
(Silence for a while).
Comes a very different dog—tell him at a glance.
Clipped and trimmed and frilled all round. Dandy
dog of France.
(Always was a dandy dog, no matter what his age)
Now his ever}' hair and frill is stiff as wire with rage.
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and in he goes,
While behind him France’s foes,
Reel and surge and pack and . close.
(Silence for a while.)
Next comes Belgium’s market dog—hard to realise.
Go-cart dog and barrow dog—lie’s a great surprise.
Dog that never hurt a cat, did no person harm ;
Friendly; kindly, round and fat as a “Johnny Darm.”
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and in he goes.
At the flank of Belgium’s foes
Who could not behind him close—
(Silence for a while).
Next comes Servia’s mongrel pup—mongrel dawgs
can fight;
Up or down, or down or up? whether wrong or right.
He was mad the other day—he is mad to-day,
Hustling round and raising dust in his backyard way.
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and in he goes,
’Twixt the legs of Servia’s foes,
Biting tails and rearmost toes—•
(Silence for a while).
There are various terrier dawgs mixed up in the
scrap,
Much too small for 11s to see, and too mad to yap.
Each one, on his frantic own —heard the row com-
mence—
Tore with hoof and claw a hole in the backyard
fence.
No one called, but in they go,
Dogs with many a nameless woe,
Tripping up their common foe—-
(Silence for a while).
From the snows of Canada, dragging box and bail
Comes the sledge-dog toiling on, sore-foot from the
trail.
He’ll be useful in the trench, when the nose is blue—
Winter dog that knows the French and the English
too.
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and in he goes,
At his father’s country’s foes,
And his mother’s country’s foes.
(Silence for a while.)
See, in sunny Southern France a dog that runs by
sight,
Dean and yellow, sharp of nose, long of leg and light.
Silent and bloodthirsty, too ; Distance in his eyes,
Leaping high to gain his view, the Kangaroo Dog
flies!
Rub his sides and point his nose,
Click your tongue and up he goes,
Lands amongst his country’s foes—
And his country’s country’s foes ;
While they sway and while they close—
(Silence for a while).
* * * *
See across the early snow, far across the plain,
Where the clouds are grey and low and winter comes
again;
By the sand-dune and the marsh—and forest black
and dumb—•
As dusky white as their winter’s night, the Russian
wolf-hounds come!
(Silence for a while.)

“Sr ”: Struck an identity of the old
Tasmanian whaling days at Southport, the farthest
south channel port of the D’Entrecasteaux
Channel, in the person of “Black Louis” —
Louis Smith, a native of the Canary Islands.
Here is some of his story. He and his mate
had been out fishing round the west coast, and
returning to Southport they picked up with Captain
Foley’s whaler. The whaling skipper hailed them
that he had left the carcase of a whale round the
coast, stripped of the blubber, and said that they
were welcome to it. Black Louis and his mate went
after the skinned fish, and on cutting up the carcase
struck a clot of ambergris which was valued at
£ll,OOO in Hobart. Louis has lived on the proceeds
of his luck ever since. This find caused a keen look-
out for ambergris. A party of bushmen some time
after came across a lump of stuff, washed up on the
beach, which was reckoned the goods. It smelt up to
specification standard, and was duly taken under
escort to Hobart. The bank folk also reckoned the
parcel as all correct, and the bushmen ran their find
into a syndicate pending the analyst’s report. The
analyst’s report came out to the effect that the
alleged ambergris was a very much decayed cheese,
probably dropped on account of its freshness by a
passing steamer.
AN AWKWARD SITUATION
KIND PERSON: “ Well, my little man, and do you go to Sunday-school?”
BENNO (annoyed): "‘Talk a bit lower, can’t you? That’s my girl over there, a n’ she’s
dead jealous of me forkin' to other tarts.”
“S.” : An attempt is being made to check
the sand-drifts on the lower Murray with lupins,
which are alleged to be better for the job than even
marram grass. The flowers —blue variety, for choice
—are sown with rye, the latter for a protection.
The lupin itself makes fair fodder; also it is not a
greedy plant, according to those who have used it,
and other things presently grow in with it. But
you’ll await further developments, .you say, before
you try it ? Well, I can’t blame you.

“O’Phimerty”: Before the closure is
applied to the bush library controversy, may I re-
mark that I once came across an old bushie, near
Ringarooma (Tas.), who had several vols. of Greek
drama as his chief literary property. He read them
with an ease that would have done no discredit to a
classical professor. Having a few fragments of
Greek left, I tested him, but it was like a river
excursion steamer butting' into a Dreadnought, lie
told me he was a graduate of Oxford. He seemed
quite sensible, however.

“S.T.S.” : The “discovery” of Australia is
generally supposed to be an elusive and illusive event
wrapped in the mists of history ; but they knew
more about it half a century ago. Browsing, in the
Melbourne University Calendar for 1859, I find it
ticketed with its date as confidently as though it
had been a murder done last week in the presence
of three policemen: “March 10. Thursday. New
South Wales discovered, 1606.”
“Te Babarantiko”; “Pick” (B. 13/8/T4)
and “The Bird” (B. 10/9/’l4) err in their natural
history items. The pilot fish is seen not in pairs, but
in any numbers, certainly up to six. Two or three
are usually on duty. Why so many when there are
no end of sharks finding their ways without pilots
is hard to account for. The pilot fish is an obliging
beast. No' shark being available, and a ship happen-
ing along, he takes charge of the ship. Irrespective
of speed the pilots hold themselves a foot or two
ahead of the stem, ranging between the forefoot and
the waterline. At intervals a pilot slackens speed,
is overtaken by the vessel, sinks under the forefoot
and reappears. When the ship souses her bows down
to the hawse-pipes in a welter of froth the pilots
vanish, and one feels inclined to bet that they have
been beaten flat —but when the forefoot reaches for
the surface there are the fish in their usual position.
Incidentally, the pilot fish is difficult to catch on a
hook, but I have seen it done. I once saw myself do
it. What “The Bird” saw at- Manly was a “sucker,”
or shark parasite, and not a pilot. The sucker is
about 4in. long, and two-thirds of this length is taken
up by the oval suction disc, a powerful organ ai:
inch or more in width. The color is a dull black.
That pilot and sucker are of any use to the shark is
doubtful. That the shark is a source of income to
them is certain. They are his poor relations and his
consistent borrowers.

“Bill Bowang”: Talking about giant
trees, I was one of a fencing gang working in the
Atherton (N.Q.) scrub, six years ago. One particu-
lar shrub we felled was a smooth-barked eucalvpt,
for rails. It was too soft a wood for posts. Having
no saw that would touch it near the ground, we got
the Kellys to work, working right round at first with
four axes going at once, until there was a chance of
chopping from two sides only. It took the best
part of a day’s chopping, and the upright fell very
cleanly, without splitting. The serviceable portion
of the trunk was 140 ft. long, and we lost a dozen
wedges making our first split, after sawing and
chopping the monster. With the aid of large hard-
wood chocks we at length split the sections, and,
after getting convenient lengths for working, all
hands started with the mauls and wedges. The grain
was beautifully even, and every rail split clean and
of even thickness. We took over 500 rails out of
that tree.
“Ginger”: The handing over of the un-
surveyed strip of territory bewcen Victoria and South
Aus. to the former State amounted to the passing
away of No Man’s Land and the obliteration of a
land-mark. In.the early days squatters settled down
in unlicensed occupation of girass lands, and made for-
tunes in wool and beef. A man cutting across coun-
try from Oodnadatta to Victoria dropped unex-
pectedly across a pub (unlicensed) and a few houses
that weren’t on the map in the Lands Office either at
Melbourne or Adelaide. No Man’s Land was a sanc-
tuary for absconding debtors. The man who bilked
his creditors in the Holy City of S.A. packed his bag
full of flimsies and lit out for the one pub in No
Man’s Land. Similarly the bloke who paid his credi-
tors by the mile in the Unholy City of Victoria laid
his hands on as much foreign capital as was avail-
able and ducked across the Border and swapped
whiskies on the pub verandah, and hatched fresh
stratagems for spoiling the Egyptians. Now the scene
is changed. There is wheat where not long ago was
the stillness of the primeval and prehistoric Bush.
Law and Order move around in the person of John
Hop. The Old Order changeth. Worthy of note is it
that the discovery of a banana plot in the ruins of a
garden belonging to an abandoned mission station in
a corner of No Man’s Land led to fairly extensive
banana growing on the holdings of the Lower Darling.

THE FIRST BLOWFLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s some that says the wattle is the herald of the
Spring,
And some that gets excited if they hear a magpie
sing ;
But I need no boughs a-blooming and no mating birds
in tune
To tell me Winter’s going, and that Springtime’s
coming soon.
For the sap flows in my whiskers, and my hair begins
to rise,
When the boss says, “Bag that meat, Kate. I can
hear the blasted flies!”
Oh, my blood begins to rise
When the boss ses “Damn the flies!”
And I know the Springtime's coinin’ when I hear the
blowflies hummin’,
And my heart leaps to the booming of the big blue-
bottle flies.
For mine, I hate the Winter, when your feet seem
always cold;
In the Spring the tarts are kinder, and the shyest
bloke feels bold.
Everyone wears brighter faces when he wears his
lighter clothes ;
And in Spring, if crops are thriving, you can go to
all the shows.
In the Spring the country bumpkin loves to dance and
drink and flirt;
In the Spring a louder crimson bow lights up his
fashion shirt,
And I dream of laughing skies,
And of laughing lips and eyes.
Oh, I dream of shows and races when the blowfly
leaves his traces
On the corn-beef and the mutton, and the boss says
“Blast the flies!”
Oh, I love the early blowfly, and 1 love to hear him
sing,
For he tells me of a season that is better than the
Spring.
lie intones about the Summer, and in fancy I can see
Lines of foamin’ pint pots waitin’ for my Christmas
mates and me—
And it’s here I’d like to mention that I hold those
lands accurst
Where a man can never generate a holy Christmas
thirst.
So I dream of thirsty skies
And of beery-cheery eyes,
Of booths and fights and shoutings, and of reckless
hare-brained outings ;
Of pots and pints and butchers when the boss says
“Damn the flies 1”
There’s some that love the Winter, when the fires
are big and bright,
But the Winter is a wowser and he keeps you in at
night,
And I don’t like fireside flirting when you know
her parents hate
To see all the firewood wasted in the shining parlor
grate.
Oh, the Summer loves a lover, and her nights are
warm as love,
And there’s barley grass beneath you, and there’s
soft white stars above.
And where there’s grass there’s grass-seeds, and I’ve
always found it sweet
Picking thorns from dainty stockings while I knelt
at dainty feet.
And I dream of Summer skies
And of Summer lips and eyes,
When the warm nights hear and tell not, when the
lips that lure repel not,
Oh, they come —these golden visions—with the
pioneering flies.

“Bill Bowang”: The iguana has at least
one feathered enemy—the bird known in Queens-
land as “the squeaker,” or soldier-bird. A common
noise in the bush is the squeaking of from 30 to 40
of these birds, which, having driven a gohanna to
the extremity of a limb, hover round and viciously
peck him. I was once interested in experimenting
with gohanna fat and oil for medicinal purposes,
and never had any difficulty in locating the ingredi-
ents if I allowed myself to be guided by the
soldier-birds.

The SLAUGHTER
FOR THE
BULLETIN
THE slaughtered foemen fell in heaps
Before our warlike brag;
In fully fifteen fearful bars
We mustered round the Flag !
I do not mind a gentle skite;
But I would fain be gone
When, full of pride and British howls,
Arises Robinson.
He gathered us, for Britain’s sake,
To many a gilded place,
Wherein all day he dwelt upon
The spirit of his race.
Quoth Henry, in his loudest tones:
“What does a Briton fear?”
1 stated I would whisky take,
And Smithers mentioned beer.
From bar to bar we marched, and as
We slew drinks, one by one.
More warlike grew the fiery zeal
Of Henry Robinson,
Until the proud defiance rang
That all his decks were cleared
To meet all foes who might be there-*
And everybody cheered.
He said he’d spend his final cent,
The blood in every vein
For Britain; and suggested we
Should fill ’em up again.
The Germans fell in mangled heaps
Before his mighty tongue;
And at the twenty=seventh drink
The Emperor was hung !
His sword was out l The squadron charged.
We saw their sabres flash;
But, when he smote, a score of foes
Fell with a jingling crash !
We parleyed with the barman grim,
“An accident!” we pled—
And then we fixed the damages;
For Robinson had fled.
1 do not mind a gentle skite;
But 1 would fain be gone
When, full of fight and British howls,
Arises Robinson!

“Henry Horsecollar”: Supposing the
British Government had the wisdom to make
me chief censor I would end the war inside
a month. My idea is to disqualify General
von Ivluck. Von Ivluck is always being
killed, captured, surrounded, wounded, shot,
cut off. getting reinforcements, and leading
vast armies backwards to tremendous deeds,
lie seems to be a mixture of Cagliostro,
Prester John, the Tichborne Claimant, the
impossible sea serpent. Adam’s first wife,
the great auk, King Arthur, Samson, and the
p<per who played before Moses. If anybody
in authority would declare that Kluck was
dead, that he never existed, that he was
wiped out, and that no further mention
should be made of him for ever and ever, the
German army would fade away. I knew
the Kluck person in my garish youth. He
was a dwarf Bft. high, and had long, bald
hair, and was an uncertificated bankrupt of
immense wealth. Some of his estates were
so large that they hung out over the sea like
a fishing rod. He is, in fact, much the same
sort of delusion as the Duke of Wellington.
There never was any such person as Wel-
lington. The British army in the Peninsula
was commanded by a hopelessly unsuccess-
ful drunkard named Briggs. Just when
things were qt the last gasp a newspaper
pian named Smith had an inspiration. lie
invented Wellington, and the tremendous
victories which that genius won on paper
so scared the French that they fled out of
the country. Smith, the newspaper man,
died in poverty, as all great and useful
patriots do.

JIMMY
GARDINER,
of Perth
(Westralia).
The late Charles Andrews, of Victoria,
might have gone far had lie possessed the
energy. He represented Geelong in the
Assembly from 3900 to 1904; then he dropped
out and stuck to his Bar practice till lie was
appointed to the Licenses Reduction Board,
where he did exceptionally good work. He
had nervous breakdown last year, and after
that he was never Charley Andrews again.
Hark Foy, who doesn't need introducing,
set out on a trip to Japan in a German vessel.
V hile still on the Australian coast war be-
tween Britain and Germany was declared.
The steamer thereupon altered her course for
Rabaul. then a German possession. To get
clear of the enemy Hr. Foy and other pas-
sengers decided upon chartering a vessel to
take them to (lie neutral Philippines. This
vessel, however, struck a reef and was
wrecked, and the party, after being picked up
by a passing ship, was landed at Yap, which
was German, too. Hr. Foy was detained
there, lint as the Japs have since captured
the place he is probably on his way home or
to Japan, and wondering what was the mat-
ter with him when he paid his good monev
to a foreign ship in the first place.
Colonel Bull, who died at Cheltenham
(Lng.) m August, came to Australia as a
civilian, and was town surveyor of Brighton
(Vic.). Constant official connection there with
Bent seems to have turned him to thoughts
of blood ; so he developed military ardor, be-
came a regular soldier, and rose to be Colonel
and Chief Military Secretary -in Victoria—a
billet in which lie worked hard, although
there was always an idea that he wouldn’t
have got it but for Toorak influence. For
Bull was handsome and much to the fore in
fashionable circles. There was simple amaze-
ment when he accepted the Governorship of
Melbourne Gaol, from which he was ulti-
mately promoted to a similar job at Pent-
ridge Stockade. Bull, as a family man, with
daughters to provide for. knew which side
his bread was buttered. The Military Secre-
taryship was lofty but thin. At Melbourne
Gaol Bull succeeded Castieau, apparently in
consequence of the escape of a female prisoner
named Anne Miniver Davis, the local Cateh-
pole. Before Castieau was Wintle, who was
Place was known as

Neil Douglas, traffic manager of IV. A.
railways, who died (aged 51) in Perth lately,
was a Maorilander who gained his first ac-
quaintance with railways in his native land.
In 1889 he realised that there were greater
opportunities across the Tasman Sea, so he
headed for Westralia and remained there till
the end—which was much sooner than was
necessary or proper.
Died suddenly last week, at Waverley,
John A. B. Cahill, one of Sydney’s oldest
and best-known solicitors. He was ad-
mitted to the roll in 18S0, and was for
years a prominent member of the old Reform
Club. Amongst others who served their
time to him were the Speaker of the
Assembly, 11. D. Meagher, and Meagher’s
former partner, the late W. P. Crick.
North Queenslanders have less time for
precedents and forms than any other crowd
m Australia ; yet, curiously, the Federal
Labor party has always depended on North
Queensland members to uphold the conven-
tions of Parliament and look after its cere-
monies. The Reps. have, as expected, again
chosen Charles McDonald as Speaker, and
iurley goes back to his perch in the Senate.
McDonald, whose sun was eclipsed in last
1 arliament bv W. Alligator Johnson, had
only one serious competitor, Bamford, and he
is from the Far North, too. McDonald was
a watchmaker at Charters Towers when the
shearers had their troubles at the birth of
ihe JO s ; and the then-fiery young man was
rushed off without a collar or tie to tell
the South what deeds were done at home.
He hasn’t been out of a Labor job since.
“O’Phimerty,” from across the Straits:—
’J he early death of Solomon, late Premier of Tas-
mania, was in keeping with his career. He won
prizes and passed examinations at an age when
others are struggling with x.yz. lie took his M.A. and
hh.M. degrees whilst working as a clerk. He had
not been elected to Parliament a week before he was
made Attorney-Gereral and Minister of Education.
He took up a tangled State Education Department,
seething with discontent, and reduced it to order and
moderate content in less time than most men would
have taken to get an idea of what was wrong, lie
became Premier at an age when the average Aus-
tralian is thinking mostly of cricket and football.
And now he has gone out at 38. lie was too big
and sincere a man for the littleness and knavery of
Party politics. The atmosphere in which they
flourished was poison to him. It distressed him and
wasted his strength. He came from a family in
which the idealistic strain is uppermost. Ilis father
is a lay preacher, who speaks with the passion of a
mediaeval saint. Solomon himself was a frequent
Preacher and his four’ brothers are all expounders.
As one who knew him with some degree of intimacy,
1 would say that there have been few whiter souls
than his; at the same time ho was a man of alto-
gether exceptional constructive ability. In losing him
Tasmania has lost a big asset.

Edward Compton Batt, senior partner in
the Sydney property-selling firm of Batt,
Rodd and Purves, died last week, aged 72.
Missing by an ace or so an appointment in
the Indian Civil Service, he came to Aus-
tralia in 1874 as business manager of the
Ramornie meat factory on the Clarence
River. In 1877 he joined B. R. Rodd, who
had an estate agency in Pitt-street, on the
site of the firm’s present premises. J. M.
Purves, one-time M.L.A. for the Clarence,
was a later addition to the firm.

Miss EusLalia nuizubeth Sluiirp, who died
recently in North Sydney, aged 84, had lived
all her long life in the cottage in which she
was born. Her mother was a daughter of
James Milsom, who had a grant of the North
Shore of Sydney Cove from Sir Thomas Bris-
bane. In course of time “Milsom” has
become “Milson,” the name now borne by
the district.
William I’ember Reeves, ex-Agent-General
for Maoriland, arrested by Germans as a spy
at Arras, in Northern France, but subse-
quently released, is head of the London
School of Economics. He is
best remembered in the
Loanly Isles as the author of
the first Industrial Arbitra-
tion Act. Fat hated Reeves,
being stung to fury by his
bitter tongue and scarifying
pen. Reeves had always more
enemies than friends. He is
a man of reserved, exclusive
habit, to whom few, if any,
people get really “close.”
Daughter Amber, whose
mamma is a woman of very
advanced political and social
opinions, took the highest
classical honors at Girton,
and. has written a rather
daring novel. When (he Boer
War was raging, Reeves, as
Agent-General, sent out an
official cable message to
Premier Seddon, announcing a
“defeat” of the soldiers of the
Queen, and the howl which
went up for his blood on
account of the use of the
wicked word kept “King
Dick” awake o' nights for
quite a long time. Reeves
is nearly 60 thin, pale, delicate of constitu-
tion, and has painfully poor eyes. Also,
he s worth a good deal of money.
One day lately Canon Bellingham married
Ralph, youngest son of the late Robert Per-
cival Johnston, of Dulwich Hill (N.S.W.),
to Beatrice, youngest daughter of Mrs. M.
Asher, of Cremorne. The groom is a great-
grandson of Colonel Johnston, of the old
N.S.W. Corps, who deposed Governor Bligh
and lost his army service as a consequence.
Died the other day, at St. Kilda (Vic.),
James Mason, with 94 years and many good
deeds to his credit. As far back as 1861-2
he was a member of the St. Kilda Council;
and in 1864 he was elected M.L.A. for Mary-
borough, and claimed to be the father of the
hrst Local _ Government Act. Meeting
with an accident he gave up politics, and,
after taking, a trip to England, only emerged
from obscurity now and again to make some
generous public gift. He presented St. Kilda
with a £3500 organ for its town hall; gave
iOo acres of land at Clayton for an epileptic
colony; granted a valuable site to Prahran
for a mechanics' institute; and gave occa-
sional large sums to the Alfred and other
hospitals.
THE MOUTH-FIGHTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Green, Bishop of Ballarat, cited the case of
Judah, which was in between two powerful rivals
(Assyria and Egypt), as a parallel fo Belgium. The
servants of King Hezekiah, of Judah, came to Isaiah.
A prophet was a man who spoke for God, and there
was no reason why prophets should be extinct now.
He grieved to think that no information had come
to him that the Ballarat congregations had been any
larger for the supreme issue of life and death before
them. —News item.
This is the way to win,
With prophets and with lies.
It is a mortal sin
If the French soldier dies
In bloody trenches on the sodden plain,
Unless his prayers have brought the Deutsehers pain.
We beat the Kaiser into a cocked hat
By filling up a church in Ballarat.
O Doctor Bishop Green!
You must not vapor thus.
Prophets are often seen
By every one of us.
They’re not extinct by any kind of means,
But now we hear them not —these Doctor Greens.
We know the way to beat the Germans flat
Is not by worshipping at Ballarat.
Sure, the true God is ours—
The German has one, too.
When the red danger lowers
Only the French God's true.
Prophets and dreams are sometimes perjuries.
Sometimes the genuine God but Austria sees.
The big battalions wear a bishop’s hat.
We win Berlin with prayer at Ballarat.
Oh, cut that nonsense out!
The God that Belgium owns
Saved Belgium not from rout,
Nor from its widows’ moans,
And ’foretime did not save her from a king,
Who from Red Rubber and from suffering ~
Cashed many a million pounds to make him fat—
Though there were churches full at Ballarat.
These men who trouble God—
Prayers from the Frank and Russ,
From Ghent and Novgorod,
For victory for “Us.”
Prayers from Vienna, and from London, too—
They all get mixed up in the central blue,
Where the mad Kaiser’s talking through his hat
That God’s at Potsdam, not at Ballarat.
No time for anthems, this:
Nor songs in minster close,
But care to never miss
A punch on Wilhelm's nose.
Raffles, bazaars and holy paper-chases
Won’t put the Prussians in their proper places.
Give them the steel until they’re on the mat,
And sing them then this hymn of Ballarat.
Prophets are with us still7~
Chidley, the Bare, is one.
We hear not now that shrill
Son of a gun.
Pray for the end of war, if you must pray,
By sacking half the kings who reign to-day—
But hot-air merchants, white and calm and fat,
Will lame no foe with prayers from Ballarat.’

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The State Treasury figures "for the first
quarter of the financial year (all the States
now balance at the end of June) are not of
much value; for though the war started with
August, the bad results are only just begin-
ning to show up. For instance, heavy ship-
ments were made to Australia just before the
I use was lighted; hence the net Customs
revenue for the quarter was £4.172,500, or
nearly £400,000 more than it was for the
corresponding fourth of the previous year.
And, of course, the States got a benefit from
that rush of trade—got it in prompt Com-
monwealth payments and in railway and
harbor receipts. But, given all that in, the
State figures are not good, mostly, no doubt,
because the drought was playing up with
trade during August and September. N. S.
Wales got in £4,125,850 and spent £5,002,675
on revenue account. Considering the new
taxes, the figures are bad enough to be draped
in black. The loan expenditure was
£2,508,204, and the Treasury hasn’t a bone
left in it. Just at present it is working on
current revenue, which has slumped horribly,
and on casual overdrafts; and it is now re-
ported to be imploring Fisher to try to come
to some arrangement with poor, harassed old
John Bull to back the States’ P.N.’s. Vic-
toria surprisingly shows a revenue of
£2,090.21!} as against £2,009,448 a yejstr ago.
Railways and “miscellaneous” are almost
wholly responsible. The Avar got in on S.
Australia early. Within three days the Broken
Hill mines were under orders to ease up.
On top of that the State has been knocked by
the worst drought within memory—a drought
which has reduced even the usually-fruitful
South-East to the condition of a desert. The
revenue shrinkage is £87,000, or very nearly
10 p.c. Westralia for the three months got
in £112,827 more revenue, and celebrated the
feat by spending £170,443 more. The deficit
for the quarter is £196,571. This tfiakeS the
accumulated deficit £051,047. As
Jack” Scaddan knows, this Is highly grati-
fying. You can’t get that much into.debt
without being well off. When Scaddan can
manage to spend altogether £1,000,000 more
than his revenue, he is going to invite the
creditors to a banquet. Everybody will be
there —except the poor little beggar' who will
have to pay the million. He will be home
asleep in bis cot. On the strength of collecting
£40,000 more, Queensland spent £95,000 more
during the quarter—not to mention the
£508,478 which it spent on loan account.
Finally, Tasmania owns- up frankly that in
the quarter it collected only £260,705, as
against £273,507 last year, and nothing in
particular was responsible. It hasn't got
any idea what: it spent, or if it. lias an idea
it keeps the thing hidden.
When war broke out the -N-. Wales
(Government Avas spending loan money at
the rate of about £9,000,000 a year, and
had a correspondingly big army of men on
its wages sheets. The struggle ,to= keep
them mere lias become almost frantic. The
job Avould have been impossible in any case,
since this one State can’t hope to raise any-
thing like £9,000.000 a year; but the in-
evitable failure is being hurried on by a
formidable shrinkage in the railway revenue,
the result mainly of the drought. The
harassed Treasurer, who sowed the wind
when he threw the Labor policy as to
restricted borrowing overboard, is now reap-
ing flie whirlwind; and as he simply had to
do something, pending a hoped-for arrange-
ment Avith the OommoiiAvealth Government,
£1,000,000 has been borrowed in London for
ono year at 5] -/he. This, however, is a
mere drop in the ocean; another million
av 11 i haA’e to be got from somewhere before
Hie end of next month, even if Holman pays
0 p.c. for it. And Avhen Cohen knows that
a man must borrow no matter Avliat he pays
-well, Cohen generally sees to it that the
desperate financier pays a good deal. There
newer was a time when the banks trading in
X. S. Wales were so well prepared to meet
a. crisis. By reason of the empty Treasury
and the size of the army employed on
Government loan works, there never was a
time Avhen a N.S.W. Government Avas so
badly prepared. And it has to meet not
one crisis but two—the drought supplying
Hie second. Holman, the man avlio led the
Government which made the mess, is flag-
rantly incapable of getting the coun-
try out of it; and the sooner he calls in a
Commission to practically take the job out
< ! his hands the better the chance of escap-
ing something really sudden and serious.
The Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New
York. —This is one of the three big United
Slates offices Avliich, some years ago, hired
King O’Malley and other gilt-spurred roosters
to fight for business in Australia. They got
it; but the cost of the roosters’ keep Avas
heavy, arid when the United States law got
tired of the insurance cos.’ mad rush after
colossal figures, the chase for new business in
these parts Avas almost abandoned. In fact,
the only one of the three offices which hoav
hunts for Australian policies is the Ncav
York Life. The Equitable is represented in
Sydney merely by an Australian firm of
accountants: and though the Mutual Life of
N. York still has its old Australian manager,
it lately sold its. big Sydney office property
for less than the extravagant price which it
paid for the land. The cos.’ accounts don’t.
of course, distinguish between Australian and
other income and expenditure • but Knibbs's
last Year Hook shows that only the New
York Life has an Australian revenue in
excess of its expenditure (including claims) :
Receipts. Expenditure.
Equitable £ 104,246 £126,317
Mutual of N. York . . . . 64,803 50,274
N. York Life 90,217 73,287
The Australian business in force at that date
(December, 1912) was as follows:
- Amount Premium
Policies; Insured; Income.
Equitable .. ... 5804 £1,980,066 £79,263
Mutual N. York .". ,3910 1,506,137 40,536
N. York Life . . 5528, 2,122,91 l 76 i 732
Except in the case of the N. Work Life the
figures are steadily declining. -
When the T’niled States Legislature shut
down on the fienzied rush for big figures it
set a limit not only on the expense rate, but
on the total amount of business which a co.
might do in a year. That maximum (assum-
ing that a co. is aiming at the maximum) is
cut up by head office among the sections of
the world in which the co. is operating, and
if any one section can only do its allotment
at an expense rate in excess of the average,
then next year it has to be. content with a
smaller allotment. Thus expenses are'se’mi-
automatically reduced to the minimum. Last
year the premium income was £11,900,210.
and the exes, (including taxes, it dicing the
Australian practice to include taxes) were
£2,235.464. This means that, about £lB
15s. Td. p.c. of the premium income goes in
exes. Unfortunately the accounts don’t dis-
tinguish between new and old business pre-
miums; and until one knows the volume of
the new business one can't say much about
the expenses* Almost fill that can be said
for certain is that, though the cost has plainly
come down a great deal, the rate p.c. of in-
come 4s still much higher than that of the
best Australian offices. Which means that,
unless the United States interest earnings and
mortality experience are exceptionally good,
the United States bonus can’t be as good as
the best Australian. On the average the
funds brought in £4 12s. 4d. p.c. last year.
1\ hether £4 12s. 4a. p.c. is good or only
moderate depends on the quality of the in-
vestments. More than half of the assets are
bonds- (Government, municipal and railroad
almost exclusively) ; and though there are a
few millions in Austrian Rentes and British
Consols and Australian State securities and
Italian Rentes and German Imperials, the
bulk is invested in America. Mortgage
loafis run to £27,489,369 and loans on
policies to £18,107,606. The mortgage loans
are practically all United States. On a
general survey of the investments, the in-
terest earnings don’t seem to Australian eyes
to be better than fair.
Prior to the cleaning-up of United States
insurance methods before-mentioned, the
deferred bonus was in most favor with the
cos. The policy-holder practically backed
himself to live a certain number of years;
and the profits were ,cut up among those
who won the bet. Under the present law,
the profits have to be cut up annually. The
reserve for “deferred dividends,” as they are
ballM, j s therefore gradually disappearing:
1911, £15,523,997; 1912. £15,335,318 ; 1913,
£14,919,071. The sum paid in bonuses last
year was £3,532,183. and the amount set
aside for payment this year is £3,712,226.
equal to 32 p.c. of last year’s premium in-
come. But clearly that is not exclusively the
year’s savings ; some of it is drawn from the
reserve which has been accumulated to pay
deferred bonuses. Any true comparison with
Australian results is, therefore, impossible.
Taking into account the comparatively small
drafts on this reserve, it looks as though the
true annual bonus is somewhere about 26
p.c., which is highly respectable.

The I*, and L. account says the profit for
(lie nast year was £243; but £97 comes off
that, having disappeared from one of the re-
serves. However, £97 is neither here nor
there when profits of £12,000 or so are
expected. The awful slump is explained by
the directors: “The accounts reflect the dis-
astrous effect of the collapse of the George-
street premises in September last. ■ The co.
has commenced proceedings against the land-
lords for damage and loss of profits conse-
quent thereon.... As the action is pending,
no comment can now fairly be made.” Per-
haps The Bulletin had better leave it at
that, too —with the one _ remark that, in
view of the pending action, there was no
particular reason why the management
should want to magnify the profits. As a
matter of fact, the co. claims that the smash
cost it a heap more than the mere reduction
of profits from £12,000 to nothing or there-
abouts. There is, for instance, “Suspense
account £18,337,” among the assets, and it
is explained that “this represents certain
of the concrete losses, and does not include
any sum for loss of profits or dislocation of
business.’’ In other words, if the co. failed
in its actions, and couldn’t recover anything
from anybody, instead of a profit of £146
last year would show a loss of £13,191.
Neither figures, of course, give any indica-
tion of what the business is capable of doing
under normal conditions. And this paper
doesn’t know that the figures for the pre-
vious three or four years were a sure guide
either. Beard Watson’s sell all kinds of
house-furnishings, maybe ; but they are best
known for good-class stuff —for the trim-
mings. as it were; for the things you can
do without; for the things you buy when
you’re “flush." In this trade they have
very few competitors: in the supply of
bread-and-clieese lines they have dozens and
dozens. All this seems to mean that Beard
Batson's may be reasonably expected to do
phenomenally well when times are very good,
and to show comparatively poor results
when times are bad. Times are not going to
be good for a long while.
The capital until the other day was
£75,000 iu ordinaries and £30.000 in' 6 p.c.
cumulative prefs. It was a very solid pre-
ference, that. Then, having need of more
capital (for the stock costs a lot of money,
and isn't the sort that moves off three
or four times a year), a second pref. issue
was made. Fortunately for the co. the
issue-—or most of it—was underwritten (the
exes., by the way, are charged against the
past year’s trading), and you won’t be
popular if you mention the subject loudly
anywhere near the Sydney Stock Exchange,
tor the underwriters got, of course, sub-
underwriting, and before the sub-under-
writers (mostly brokers) could unload on
to the public, William of Germany played
them a nasty trick. However, though the
si)ares.-stuck, they carry 7 p.c. ; and there
are £52,500 worth issued. Thus the prefs.
will want £5475 a year, and the co. must
make that much before the ordinaries can
have a taste. As against that must, be set
the fact that the new money will save the
co. a. fair amount in interest. On July 31
the total liabilities were £93,963. At that
, llo wever, only £12,066 of the new
of share money had been paid in.
Ihe stocks are very heavy—£l4o.93o.
i robably the upset on the premises may have
led to an accumulation of goods and a con-
sequent increase in liabilities. Book debts
aie also heavy—£s6,634. In view of the
slump from war and drought, the co. would
be more'happily placed if both these items
were a lot less.

Subject to remarks hereunder.
The launching cost £4039 and bills for a few
pounds came in afterwards; but there is no
other “water” in the concern. That is to
say, nobody got any free shares for suggest-
ing that the co. should be launched or for
assisting in the process; or if anybody did get
anything it is buried in the total of £4039
which covers the cost of preliminary opera-
tions. The promoter was W. It. Diamond,
who had been managing the N. S. Wales end
of a big insurance business which was mak-
ing profits in Australia to be spent some*
where else. Diamond reckoned that Aus-
tralia could do very well with the profits
itself, and that it would never be much of a
country if it went on feeding the foreigner,
pmee then, things have happened which
have convinced a lot of Australians
that they were mad to fatten the
foreigner by supplying his mills and
factories with raw materials and buying his
manufactures; and in time the crowd will
.also realise that it is just as foolish to send
insurance business out of Australia, Then
the Federal and other highly deserving Aus-
tialian cos. will get more of their own.
From the table it looks as though the first
year was more profitable than the second!
Dots of things are not what they look. In
the first year of an insurance co. premiums on
new business come in throughout the 12
months. The revenue shows all these pre-
miums ; but that revenue lias to provide for
risks which run on in some cases another 11
months or more. So the surplus revenue for
that year is not really profit at all. ..Cer-
tainly the surplus for succeeding years may
not be all profit either. For instance, in 391 0
?ou had a premium income of (say) £50,000.
In 1911 you had £60,000. Consequently you
must have got in £lO,OOO net of new business
in 1.111: and as some of that business was
probably not got till December, it follows that
some of the surplus for 1911 would not be
true profit either. Under ordinary circum-
stances, however, a larger proportion of a
co. s first-year’s premiums is required to cover
unexpired risks than in any subsequent year.
If the average duration of the policy for
which premiums were collected by this co. in
(he first year was four months, then a proper
anrount to set aside for unexpired risks was
£3.195. or twice the amount paid in claims
that year; and and that would wipe out the
first year’s profit altogether. And if a
proper amount were set aside from the second
year s surplus, there would be very little
loft foi pi out iii that period either. net
premiums in the first year were £11,621; in
second year they were as much ’ as
£22,3d2. New business was no doubt coming
in all the year; and if the average duration
of the policy was six months, then £1877
would be a proper amount to put by to cover
unexpired risks on new policies (this amount
is equal to 35 p.c. of the net new premiums
for six months). So far as true profits are
concerned, Ttie Bulletin wouldn’t therefore
like to say that the co. has yet made any
But it has done remarkably well, for all that.
It has. got a net premium income of £22,352,
of which very nearly half was new business
last year; and the total exes, were only
£10.378, or 46 p.c., which is a satisfactory
performance. If the claims had been as satis-
factory, the accounts would look much
brighter from the shareholders’ point of view
From the depositors’ point of view, no weeds
are showing in the garden. The paid capital
is £.->i.214. and the uncalled in reserve
£111.641; and the called-up capital could pay
losses 34 times greater than last year’s
though the experience then was by no means
good.
A.M.C., Ltd. (Sydney).—This concern
was built out of the wreck of the Austral-
asian Motor Cab Co., which was promoted
iu London and unloaded on to the unso-
phisticated Australian. The basis of the
thing was shocking, and the subsequent man-
agement was worse; in fact, the control ot
a fleet of Sydney taxis from London was
quite as bad as might have been expected.
Add to this that the co. didn’t get the capital
it asked for and needed, and that some motor
people went bung and couldn’t carry out
their contracts with the co., and there was
a lovely mess altogether. Eventually. Lon-
don having put up practically none of the
money, the Australians managed to shift the
control to this side; and, incidentally, half
the capital was written off. But even the
10s. in the £ wasn’t all represented by tan-
gible assets, so “Goodwill, £2903,” had to he
thrown in as a makeweight. The new
co. took the business over as from
June 1, 1913. The old co. had been organ-
ised in the usual lordly English manner of
the London guinea-pig, and it took the new
co. some months to get things down to a
bread-and-cheese basis, or thereabouts. The
policy of the co. was entirely changed: it
was found that, for a eo. like this, ordinary
taxi business was hopeless, and none of the
cars are therefore now on the ranks. The
co. simply hires out vehicles from its own
premises, and the directors say they are doing
better that way. So far, however, they are
not fattening their shareholders; for the
first six months of the year there was. a loss
of £l5OO, and for the second half a profit
of £942, so the net result for the whole year
is a loss of £558. Apparently, under normal
conditions, and after providing for deprecia-
tion, the net annual profit is well under
£l5OO. (From Dec. to March, both inclu-
sive, the profit averaged £193 a month, ar.d
for April and May £B4 a month.) The
written-down capital is £27,130; so the co.
js, not yet earning 4 p.c. On these figures,
it’s a question whether the business doesn't
want some more reorganising. “Salaries
and directors’ fees” cost £1775 for the 12
months—nearly half as much as the wages
bill. The results don’t seem to be worth
the money. Tangible assets are alleged to
be worth about 17s. 6d. in the £ of the
capital. The majority of the shareholders
would no doubt be delighted to handle the
17s. Gd.; anybody who liked could have the
business and the chance of making a fortune
out of it.

Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla

problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have get gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

Bangadang, the Melbourne-owned gold
sulphite show at Adelong (N.S.W.), is crush-
ing with a 5-head mill, but a big up-to-date
plant is to be installed. Ore body is well
over 30ft. wide in the bottom crosscut, and
as the stuff now going through is worth
ISdwt., Wesley believes in the show as a
“most valuable property that, once opened
up, must give big returns. Mining will be
cheap and the metallurgical side simple.”
ITobably there will be an appreciable by-
product in arsenic. The show, which has
had many enemies, has had a consistent
barracker in little Langford, who wears his
hat at a more confident angle since Wesley
took charge. Wesley certainly is a big man
for the job: from being Sticht’s off-sider at
Mt. Lyell he became metallurgist at Morgan,
where the inevitable disagreement with other
powers soon occurred.

Instead of between 400 and 500 men only
about 40 are at work on the tin mines in
New England (N.S.W.) ; and matters are
getting desperate up there. Weeks ago The
Bttlletin proposed that, in order to keep the
pot boiling, the representatives of various
Australian mining interests should come
together and hammer out a scheme under
which production could continue, the owners
mortgaging the output to the Federal Govern-
ment, and in return getting an advance in
the shape of Commonwealth notes. The
matter has been chewed over by this Minister
and that; but the proper course of calling a
conference at which the Government might
consult owners, miners, ore-buyers and the
Commonwealth Bank has not been taken. At
present the N.S.W. State Government is
“considering” a proposal made through
Thomas, M.L.A., that it should make ad-
vances against tin oxide; and the State Gov-
ernment is likely to go on “considering” it.
The fact is it hasn’t the money. It has all
it can do to chew what it has already bitten
off—indeed it is only doing that much with
great difficulty.
Hawkins’ Hill Reward cleaned up 131 oz.
last month from 125 tons, which is 20oz.
better than for August. The reef is nearly
vertical, and the rise connecting the 320 ft.
level is expected to break through to the
200 ft. level very shortly. The new reef at
the 200 ft. level is showing payable stone, and
a 12iu. body is being followed north. The
stone in both levels is worth about loz., but
costs are high—they couldn’t be anything else
with so narrow a reef. Prospects in No. 1
winze from the 320 ft. level have improved, so
the co. may be tempted to sink the shaft
another lift; and open another level. The
nominal capital is £20.000 in 80,000 shares,
and there isn’t much prospect of a dividend
on such a mob from small monthly crushings
of ounce stone.

The metal is down to about £l4O now, so
there couldn’t be much if any profit left
had the mine continued work. When the war
struck the co., it had debts of £4264 and
assets £17,004, and w T as, therefore, in a
tolerably easy frame of mind. All the same,
it had to shut up because its ore buyers
served it the same way that the Germans did
Broken Hill. Enough lias been done in the
new paddock to show that the average of
1.2871 b. per cub. yard, got from 2,755,000
cub. yards so far sluiced, is likely to be well
beaten in the next run. But that and the
cheapening of costs by the scrapping of old
barge appliances cannot make up for the slump
in tin. So the co. is sitting tight and helping
its old staff of workers to mine for tin on
their own account by giving them free water
and charging no royalty.

When the granite bar cut out in the 225 ft.
crosscut at Edna May, Weston’s (W.A.),
the market strengthened. Operators soon
knew that the oxidized rone had not been
lost and expected great things. These
came on the proving of the lode in the cross-
cut —a width of 18ft. of 2oz. dirt. Scared
bulls took fright, and by rushing the market
to over £6 10s. gave the mine a market
valuation of well on the way to £300,000.
Putting the length of the shoot in the two
bottom levels at 260 ft., the width at 18ft.
and the height at 150 ft., assuming no ore
taken out at 150 ft., and giving in 10.000
tons at the 75ft. level, there is about 55,000
tons in the mine. The official average of
80s. per ton has so far been verified. This
would show £220.000 of ore in sight, and
deducting costs (say 15s. per ton all round),
£lBO,OOO profit is in view, or £4 7s. Od. per
share. At the end of May the co. reported
30,000 tons in sight down to the 150 ft,
level, and as crushing has been going on
steadily since then it is clear that the
tightness of scrip and an awkward bear
position shot up prices. There is talk of a
monthly 4s. dividend now the crosscutting is
over. Quite_ possible; but the possibilities
of a little 15 p.c. “war” tax are also worth
keeping in mind. Scaddan will certainly
have to do something very energetic.

Burtville (W.A.) ore-bodies are irregular
in size, but they keep their values well.
Gaston and King, or the Nil Desperandum,
have just cleaned up 400 tons for 18440 z.
over the plates. This mine lias been worked
for IT years, but for a long while the
owners stuck to narrow quartz leaders and
neglected the lode formations. Still out of
41S0_ tons from the leaders they belted
£88,700. After getting on to the lodes proper
they took, for a start, £7BOO from 425 tons
and then had the residues left.

It’s a poor time to float anything, but the
people who own the Golden Bell, at Burt-
ville (W.A.), are going to chance it. This
little show was mentioned a few months
back. It is right up alongside Burtville
township, and within quarter of a mile of
the State battery. Down to 140 ft. the mine
gave 65900 z. from 2408 tons, and was only
worked then as a prospecting show. The
owner got tired or thirsty or something at
that stag;e, and took a spell. It is reckoned
by his friends that a co. would do more good
for him. as well as doing a lot of good for
itself. The owner is to get 10,000 shares out
of 30,000, the vendor (who has been to cer-
tain expense) 10.000. and the public is
offered 10,000 at 10s., of which 4s. is to be
paid on application and allotment. As there
is payable stone in the bottom and a State
battery so handy, it is thought that the 4s.
on 5000 shares will be enough to give the
thing a start. A. B. Macgregor. of Vickery’s
Chambers, has the business in hand.

The Victorian gold output for the three
quarters of this year is 324,8400 z. fine, or
7000 oz. less than for the same term last
year. That it wasn’t worse was due to two
or three of the Bendigo mines. Everywhere
else the tally was worse.
* * * *
South Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), has
started boring and has got a record sample
of 2|dwt. from its first bore into the gutter
from the intermediate level. The country
driven through carries plenty of quartz
leaders, and is as likely-looking as any
ground on the Langi lead. Before this the
co. scraped up some fine gold from its shaft,
but that was from a high-level reef wash
and was not worth thinking about. Now
that a real sliotty sample lias come from the
deep ground there can be no excuse for the
South dawdling over the real job of pecking
into the lead.

Corella Copper, Cloncurry (Q.), having
called up its last shilling, wants the right
to call up another half-crown. Of course
the confident anticipation is that only six-
pence will be necessary to get the smelter
going; but in these times of low metal
prices and high costs it is not likely that
that will be enough. Earle Huntley’s figures
set out that there are 17,500 tons to treat,
containing 1620 tons copper. He doesn’t
say what the charges will be; but as the
Rosebud is a shallow little show the ore
ought to be cheap to handle.
'* • * * *
At 700 ft. vertical Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.)
is driving injure assaying 25 p.c. copper for
a width of 55in. During a recent short run
of 20 days the smelter treated 4219 tons ore
for 401 tons blister, containing 396 tons
copper, T2ooz. gold and 33970 z. silver. The
average was 9.39 p.c. copper, worth £5 12s. Sd.
per ton, with the metal at £6O. Smelting
about 200 tons per day, Hampden should do
well enough out of 9 p.c. ore; but the neigh-
boring Mount Elliott’s career is a warning
not to expect that sort of thing to last. Pre-
sent market value of shares is, however, so
low that the mine will be a dreadful dis-
appointment if it can’t make that much pro-
fit. Shares were selling at 16s. when the
Duchess was showing rich ore at the 110 ft.
and 260 ft. levels. Then the market raced to
over 50s. per share, as very ordinary develop-
ment continued to 550 ft. Now ’ that the
bornite shoot is showing good form at 700 ft..
shares are back to 16s. again. There are
350,000 issued, so the market says £280,000
for the lot. Reserves are estimated to con-
tain 25,000 tons of copper.
At Charters Towers Clark’s is still taking
the fancy of the local punter who likes a
cheap gamble. The deepest level (469 ft.)
has lately been extended towards the Lady
Maria shaft in rather broken country ; but
prospects are improving again, and 12in. of
stone is showing in the end at 421 ft. from
the plat.
* * * *
Dalmayne Collieries, Ltd., have made a
valiant rush on the entrenched capitalists
with a prospectus offering 50.000 shares of
£1 each. The collieries, covering an area
of 1292 acres, are eight miles from St.
Mary’s, on the east coast of Tasmania. It is
estimated there are 28 million tons of coal on
the property and that the stuff can be landed
in Melbourne for 10s. 6d. per ton. An annual
output of 150,000 tons is expected, and the
net profit therefrom is estimated at £43,000
per annum. The vendors’ take £55.000 in
paid up shares. £20,000 worth of shares
have been underwritten; but as Dal-
mayne Collieries will have to put up a big
fight against the people who monopolise the
coal trade, £20,000 will riot go far towards
opening up the mine and establishing a sales
department.
In the last six months Brilliant. Deeps,
Towers, produced £14,419 from
4404 j tons, and concentrates in hand are
rioA/? a(: There is a debt of about
£lBOO at the bank. The mine is employing
lo head of stamps, so with luck it should
soon wipe off the overdraft and put some-
thing by towards shaft sinking and the
development -of another level below No. 7
(27001 t.). The block between No. G and
No. 7 is the best in the mine, so that’s
encouraging.
* * * *
If it were possible to take a census of
those men who regularly howl, “Go on the
land, young man,” it would probably be
found that more than half of them do It be-
cause every new man on the land, and especi-
ally every inexperienced young man, means
something juicy for them to suck. So they
keep up the howl, and the young man takes
the bait. Everyone is going to be his best
friend. But when he starts he finds
himself up against the machinery agent, who
sells at cost price phi.s manufacturers’ profit,
plus his own and a few other commissions ;
the seed-wheat firm and the manufacturer or
importer of fertilizer; the man who supplies
wheat-sacks and chaff-bags and twine; the
storekeeper with whom he runs a yearly
account because lie gets only one cheque a
year, and who, because he gives long terms,
pushes up his prices to dizzy heights; the
agent who is going to be a good Samaritan
because he sees that the cocky is in n tight
place, so gives him a lift by advancing on his
wheat and charging only SO p.c. one way
and another; and then, on top of it all, he
finds that his freight bill is about ten times
the size that he imagined any freight bill
could he. If he is a long distance out of town
and his neighbors are so far away that lie
never sees them, he gets sick of it all and
gives it up; and then the machinery agent
and the others howl for another energetic
young man to take his place.
Or, rather, that’s what it used to be. But
closer settlement, more railway lines and
motor-cars are working a change, and bring-
ing the farmers together. And the more they
come together the worse it’s going to be for
the mp-k who supplies them with material at
ruinous prices ; for with conference comes co-
operation sooner or later. Unfortunately the
average farmer has a habit of thinking that
a co-operative concern doesn’t need money,
which means that in the end very many of
the new companies are starved and die, and
then the old pirate gets busy again with re-
newed energy. But once the co-operative con-
cern gets a footing and has command of a
decent capital, the benefits that the farmers
reap are marvellous.
Maoriland easily leads the way in this
respect; and of the numerous co-operative
cos. in the Dominion the N.Z. Farmers’
Co-op. Associatihn of Canterbury is far and
away the largest and most prosperous. In
fact, it justly claims to be the largest in
the Southern Hemisphere. This big concern
was founded in 1881 by Charles Ensor, then
president of the Amberley Farmers’ Club,
after a particularly bloodthirsty lot of pirates
had been at work. The trade of Canterbury
was mostly in the hands of district store-
keepers. Goods were supplied at exceedingly
high rates, while, to square things, the
butter, cheese and grain taken from the
farmers in exchange were allowed • for at
minimum prices. From fourpence to five-
pence for butter was considered good, and
sometimes settlers had to be content with a
great deal less. As far as wheat and oats
were concerned, the rates were usually fixed
by the storekeepers, and the growers had to
accept whatever it might be and look
pleasant. Seeds were both expensive and
unreliable. When the string binder came
into use, the twine was imported from
America. A M.L. firm, however, soon got to
p work, and manufactured a binder twine
from flax. This twine was packed in cases
to imitate the American production and was
sold to the farmers as “Best American.”
This trick would have passed muster had it
not been that the cases were made from
kauri.
It was about this time that a number of
farmers invoked the practical sympathies of
the late Mr. Charles Ensor in an effort to
get rid of all this rapacity and fraud, and
the Canterbury Farmers’ Co-op. was formed
as a result. A capital of £17,555 was raised
or promised from 800 shareholders ; the object
of the co. was to offer facilities to the farmer
for the storage and shipment of his products,
to effect advances to shareholders and to act
as .agents in the purchase of cornsacks,
woolpacks. agricultural implements, seeds,
etc. At the start there was a staff of
a secretary and a boy. To-day the perma-
nent staff numbers over 650.
The co. now runs its own —which means
that the farmers run their own —bacon-curing
factory and freezing works, makes its own
binder twine, and manufactures its own now-
famous “Co-op.” brand of fertilizer, thus
saving not only manufacturers’ profit, hut
agents’ fees and sea freight; and it also
deals very largely in agricultural machinery
of every description. In addition there -is a
universal store, a small-goods department
and a motor agency. The annual output of
twine is something over 500 tons, some of
which finds its way to Australian farmers
through local co-operative concerns: and
during the past 12 months over 7000 tons
of “Co-op.” fertilizer was supplied to mem-
bers. The wool-selling branch put through
11,707 bales and the commission rebated to
shareholders on that alone is very consider-
able. And on top of all these savings the
member gets the $1 p.e. dividend on his
capital and the substantial bonus on all
goods supplied by the co. Moreover, as he
is really selling the goods to himself, he can
b.! sure that no sharp practices are adopted.
Taking all the; things into consideration,
it is no wonder that the co-operative feeling
is growing very rapidly, not only in Maori-
land but in every dairying and farming coun-
try. The Co-op. of Canterbury in the first
year had a turnover of £15,284. Ten years
later (in 1892) it was £881,770. In 1912
it had grown to £3.102,282, and for the past
year it was £8,380.420. or more than ten
times the total in 1892. The authorised
capital has been increased from £250,000. in
1882, to £1,250.000, while paid capital is
now £884,000 (divided among 7447 mem-
bers) as compared with £3511 at the close
of the co.’s first year..

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, October 12, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Mayor Richards the other afternoon opened
the exhibition which has been sent in from
the Technical College and local trade schools.
Possibly this was the special attraction that
collided with the Jopp effort for a sale of
gifts to buy a motor ambulance. Anthony
Horderns’ new Fine Arts Gallery will roof
the trade-school exhibits until October 24.
The morning of the last race day had
sulky skies and tricky showers that alarmed
the chiffon brigade into wearing sad-colored
tailor-mades. Even though the showers were
only showers the wearers of these warm,
woollen goods looked more joyful than the
dejected ladies in diaphanous rags. A cold
wind, whipping in after the rain, flung the
limp flounces and the gossamer tunics into
disorder, and cast a pale-blue shadow over
the summer girl’s expressive nose. One pretty
damsel in a white lingerie robe with a red
sash tucked round her waist shivered in the
blast without so much as a lace scarf to
wrap round her perished shoulders.
Our more expensive people were tamed
down in coats and skirts. One damsel
cheered up the scenery by . popping her
comely head into a bit of golden-brown
upholstery that was made in the likeness of
a small, tiglit-fitting hat. Mrs. Tom Hughes,
in a shade of blue I decline to mention
because its technical name is unknown to
me, was hatted in the same tint, with a
fluff of tulle to keep a large red-and-cream
rose from catching cold. Mrs. Lipscomb
dared the wintry wind in an elegantly frigid
garment of black niuon and shimmering silk
flounces. Mauve roses of the delightful tint
no gardener can grow covered the lady’s
neat locks. Blue-eyed Etta Norris tripped
round in a tailored champagne outfit, with
a suggestion of tulle—a useful wrap on a
cold day—round her throat. Mrs. Spencer
Brunton, carefully garbed in old rose bro-
cade, took no heed of the breeze that yelped
round the corner, where the bookies do busi-
ness under the trees. The pretty Mrs.
Henry Osborne, in a pepper and salt cos-
tume, was top-dressed in saucy black mil-
linery. Mrs. Leonard Dodds, with a wisp of
ermine round her neck, was entrenched in a
big coat. The tall, trim figure of Miss
Itossiter was clad in a tight-fitting emerald
green cloth gown, witli pudding-basin mil-
linery of the same shade, edged with a fluff
of black fur.
Very few freak outfits tramped the damp,
spongy Randwick turf on Saturday. One
that deserves honorable mention was a skirt
and cape ensemble. The former garment
was made out of dark stuff with gorgeous
stripes going up and down it, like a police
sergeant on a beat. The garment being slit
up behind, the girl inside showed about one
yard of white stocking to the casual gaze.
A big cape, which nearly snuffed out the
small wearer, more or less completed this
bizarre attire.
All kinds of hats had been sorted out of
winter cupboards by the thrifty, and the
ancient winged millinery that looked as if it
had been out all night in a storm turned its
feathers fiercely to the chilly breeze. Wraps
of all sorts had also been hurriedly torn from
secret fastnesses. In one case a white Indian
silk shawl helped the owner to feel less like
a glacier.
The newspapers talk about the atmos-
phere of calm and confidence in England ; and
the knowing suburbanite shrugs his shoulders, '
having heard about press censors and the re-
pression of correspondents at the front.
However, there’s plenty of evidence that in
this the newspapers speak the simple truth.
For instance, early this year J. W.
Mcßobert, of the Robert Harper Co., took
his wife and retinue of daughters off for a
course of Europe. He was to stay nine
months, they 18. When the bomb exploded
there was hurried talk of rearranging every-
thing ; in the face of Death who should
divide them? Within a month or so all
such ideas were abandoned —by that time
there seemed no good reason why father
shouldn’t go back to help look after Aus-
tralia while mother and the girls were left
confidently in the keeping of Kitchener.
Several of the younger school-marms be-
lieved that the Agricultural Ground was to
be the official paddock for the State Schools’
display on October 14. At the last minute
they got the right tip. and led their flocks
to the Sydney Cricket Ground for the first
rehearsal.
The Norman Hangars got back to Sydney
with nothing more serious happening to
them than the usual scares at spa. They
landed in plenty of time for Mrs. Norman to
see about her race frocks for the Spring
r-.eeting.
Mrs. J. O. Fairfax is another homing
pigeon bound for this comparatively peace-
ful loft by the next Orient liner.
N.S.W. Boy Scouts, whose campaigns in
the piping times of peace mainly consisted
of raids on the domestic jam-pot, or fierce
camp sorties on grilled chops, are making
themselves useful to the Red Cross circles.
The active little urchins are enthusiastic
messengers. Some of them are so keen about
dashing off on errands that in time the
sewing-and-socks ladies will have to invent
messages to keep the Boy Scout as busy as
he wants to be. In remote suburbs mos-
quito outposts on bicycles may be met (met
is a quiet, Arcadian definition of the tryst
between a preoccupied pedestrian and an
enthusiastic boy on wheels), tearing up the
dust as they fly across the landscape. In
consequence of the generally-useful work
these youngsters are doing, C.J. Cullen lias
agreed to preside over the machinations of
the Scout Association.
When Melba was in Sydney the patriotic
song-writers who chivvy her from place to
place fairly bombarded her with the kind
of music that ranges from bad to worse, and
from worse to the bottom of all things.
With one eye on the Empire’s call and the
Red Cross Fund, and the other glued to
the main chance, some of the patriots made
the following affable request : If Mrs. Nellie
would sing their music at the concert in our
Town Hall the composers would obtain leave
to sell copies in the interval, and half the
proceeds would be handed over to the Em-
pire. As the other half would be for
the vendors’ pockets, it wasn’t a bad scheme
for the composers—or wouldn’t have been if
the transaction had come off. Alas! so
many transactions don’t come off.
After an exciting voyage from London in
the Osterley, insurance manager E. do Gyu-
lay and his wife are settling down to a
normal life as peaceful inhabitants of
Neutral Bay. The returned travellers
luckily began their sight-seeing by going
over ground that is now belching flames and
smoke, and saw something of Austrian
scenery before there was an audible rum-
bling of the present storm. The de Gyulays
were in London when the trouble began.
In London the Bath Club is forming an
Artists’ Corps for home defence. Oscar
Asche, who would prove a fine, burly mili-
tant in a fight at close quarters, and the
Australian sculptor, Bertram Mackennal,
have joined this hand of hope.
The redoubtable “Snowy” Baker sends a
line from Brisbane. He is bustling round
that township to arrange a patriotic car-
nival similar to the gigantic Sydney affair.
With 60 items on the programme, and the
local Mayor and Mayoress harnessed in the
front of the citizens’ committee, money
ought to be pulled into Bananaland’s cash-
box. Mrs. Baker rushed up to the northern
hamlet to help her pet athlete in the
scheme. November 80 is the date for this
raid on the public purse.
The Free Kindergarten babes are going
to demonstrate in the Town Hall on October
24. It's to be an afternoon show, and the
sub-regal presence has been promised. Six
hundred toddlers will take part in this effort
to exhibit their prowess. Such work as
veterans of from three to six summers can
achieve will be on view in the cellar-like
basement of the municipal hall.
Mrs. Keith Jopp, an attractive dame
from one of our very best suburbs, rallied
her forces for an auction-gift afternoon the
other day. The object of the sale (which
took_ place in only a limited sense, for the
auctioneer called in the goods when the busi-
ness showed signs of dropping dead) was
the raising of funds for a motor ambulance
—“for the front,” of course. A few en-
thusiastic friends sent in some good saleable
stuff. A few others, whose enthusiasm may
have leaked out in responding to about 100
other war cries, inadvertently sent along
relics that looked like old rubbish, but may
have been young heirlooms. Mr. Helmsley,
of a Sydney legal firm, was the only person
present who had money to burn, and the (
prices he offered for old rags and battle- '
ments and traditions and disabled cannon
were amazing. He bought some left-off
entrenchments at a figure which was calcu-
lated to stagger the Bank of England.
The notion of giving the money towards
a motor ambulance for the Australian Field
Hospital is quite as practical as auctioneer
Lawson said it was. When he tried to flog
the patriotic conscience out of its lethargy,
the conscience rose languidly to a guinea or
two for the Cause. But the circle of bid-
ders was small, and the whole business had
been scarcely mentioned in anything but a
whisper beforehand. Soldier Finn made a
few remarks to help on the rush to the
bargain-counter—and the rush needed it.
Ilis own offerings included an emir’s best,
hat (Omdurman) that was like a padded
head-cell. (The emir is dead now and wear-
ing a halo.) Mrs. Tom Watson’s gift-—a
small, good-looking box of the snuff species
—went off without much pushing. But
Paul Kruger’s waistcoat couldn’t find a
bidder. It was a hideous garment, any-
how. _ Oom Paul never did much credit to
his tailor, still the garment once went round
the circumference of a hero, and, as Kruger
was the last of the Drippers, he ought to be
held in remembrance. The world is becom-
ing so crowded that there will never again
be room for Drippers. Still, a collar-stud
of the dashing Botha, or half a brace belong-
ing to the gallant Joubert, would have been
quite another kind of deal. These men
looked much better in a ballroom than old
Farmer Paul.
Beard, Watson’s rooms, where the sale
dragged its weary length till the auctioneer
stopped it (with sharp reproaches to those
present), was strewed with the contribu-
tions of Mrs. Jopp and her friends. Some
of the contributions in the shape of chairs
were sat on by those present, who were
thankful to sink into any kind of seat when
some of the art treasures were held up to
view. A walking stick, which bore a per-
sonal reference tied on to its handle, alleging
that it really had belonged to the fighting
Duke of Wellington, was sold at a fair
price. As a matter of fact, the crusty old
warrior must have walked thousands of
miles, and used hundreds of sticks to help
him along, for no curio collection is com-
plete without an Iron Duke walking stick.
Baritone Malcolm McEachern is now tak-
ing to the profession seriously. He has
started teaching, and his roll runs to 50 or
so voices.
The Bradford (England) Art Gallery
has bought a cartoon of Will Dyson’s, and
one of Fred Deist’s virile black-and-white
sketches, “An East End Doss House.” Deist
does nothing better than these pictorial re-
minders of the gulf between London East
and London West. Most of them that come
this way appear in the Graphic.
Once more into the “Votes for Women”
breach in England stamps Harriet
Newcomb, formerly a school-marm in Syd-
ney. Of late years the loquacious lady has
been stung by the militant Pankhurst bee, and
devotes most of her time to the rousing of
enfranchised man to a proper understanding
of his inferiority to unfrancliised woman.
Just now Miss Newcomb is lion. sec. of the
British Dominions’ Woman Suffrage Union.
In the course of an appeal for warm clothes
for the children of the London poor in the
present crisis, she whips her favorite hobby-
horse into a gallop. “This fearful war is
the climax of government by men only,” she
tells us; and, while the shivering child wails
on the doorstep, she takes time to add that
man is a universal grab-all. However,
Woman in future will see to it that he gets
into no more of these scrapes for “financial
success.” It’s a queer hole-in-the-corner way
of looking at the present squabble.
Amy Castles, writing from Milan, says the
war has hit the musical fraternity very
hard. Numbers of professionals are singing
in the streets for their daily fried fish, or
whatever is the rotund Italian tenor’s sub-
stitute for the British citizen’s daily crust.
Mrs. Day, who is an inspector in the
Public Health Department of N. S. Wales,
is finding plenty of excitement in England
to while away her leave of absence. She
is staying with a married daughter, Mrs.
Pope, in a small Essex hamlet. (Essex is
a muddy and low-lying spot to the east of •
London.) When the general upheaval
started, the Australian woman hurriedly
formed herself into the nucleus of a Red
Cross Society as honorary organising secre-
tary. After the rustic intelligence had been
bustled out of its accustomed calm —the vil-
lage took to Red Cross work with unex-
ampled ferocity, and interest in bucolic
things began to slide. Now they’ve got one
of the rest stations approved by Kitchener;
and the very badly injured, travelling by
rail from the coast to military hospital
further inland, have their journey broken in
this once peaceful vale. So Inspector Day,
who surges with energy in time of peace, is
more or less boiling over with it at the
present moment.
The energetic lady, by the way, left one
son behind her in Sydney. When she returns
- —or probably before —she’ll find he has been
energetic too. The youth volunteered for
“the signalling corps of the Expedition, and
has been accepted on the strength of his
amateur-wireless achievements.
A Canadian correspondent whose relatives
fought with the South in the United States
Civil Wa r sends an interesting story about
a poem which is usually ascribed to Mrs.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox. In one edition of the
United States woman’s rhymes it is called
“Solitude.” It is a popular item with ama-
teur reciters, and begins “Laugh and the
world laughs with you !” Says the indignant
voice from Mapleland : “I was astonished to
see this poem in a recent copy of Ella
Wheeler "Wilcox verse. In my possession is
an old newspaper cutting containing the
verses, which are there properly ascribed to
the gallant Colonel John A.' Joyce, who
fought with the Kentuckians in 1862. In
December of that year he wrote the lines,
which he called ‘So the World Goes,’ at the
Gait House, Louisville, Kentucky, at the re-
quest of a friend, George D. Prentice. I
believe Colonel Joyce was killed early in the
war.”
Organising-seeretary Grace Burrows —the
capable spectacled lady in charge of the
Girls’ Realm —has fled to Woy Woy for her
annual holiday. Grace is a disciple of
Isaak Walton. So, for the next two or
three weeks, there will be little hope for
young and inexperienced fish who play
round the shores of Wagstaff Point. Fish
are hereby warned, and if they don’t buy
this paper it is their own lookout. Wag-
staff is the place where the record mos-
quitoes sing to the moon, and the sleek
kine steeplechase over the hills to the cow-
bails.
Hugh Buckler and the golden-haired Violet
Paget have unpacked their grease paints
after a tour in Maoriland. The Little
Theatre management has sent forth small
placards in b ush pink, urging the friends
of the above to rally round and shake them
by hand. Thursday evening (October 15)
is the date of the shake.
The march through the city of the N.S.W.
boys in uniform was a slow business, under
a hot sun. The steady swing and fine- ap-
pearance of our troops, as they tramped along
to the saluting base in Macquarie-street, was
inspiriting to the taxpayer. It looked a
good investment, this interminable brown
caterpillar, with thousands of legs, creeping
through dense crowds of admiring friends and
relatives. The glitter and pomp of Vic-
torian warriors has been wisely boiled down
to plain khaki rag. Even the Scottish unit
had been bereft of its kilts. The skirl of the
bagpipes was the only old memory left of the
Macgregors and the Campbells, whose tartan
breeks used to be decked with patterns as
large as carpet-bags. G.-G. Munro Ferguson
and the substitutes of his once-plumed staff
watched the Cornstalks trail past the Mitchell
Library.
“Johanna” (Miss Amy Dow) who sup-
ports the Melbourne end of The Bulletin's
social news, has said “I will” to a Melbourne
man whose front name is Frank. “Jo-
hanna,” in one of her whirling descents on
this town, mentioned her young man’s name,
but the whole office has apparently mislaid
the information. The management and
staff sent Miss Dow a cruet-stand and an
lOU for all (he money they owe and never
hope to pay, with their best wishes. P.S. —
The groom’s name is Frank Steel Perry.
News drops in that ostrich-expert Her-
bert, of Yanco, has put the old question to
Miss Grace Williams, of that locality. And
I understand the lady said the usual “Yes”
in the customary whisper.
On the recent anniversary of the death of
the veteran Dr. James Cox, the small, old-
fashioned church at Mulgoa took to itself a
brass memorial tablet. The little village
with the long red road that bites a way for
itself at the foot of the ranges is associated
with many early pioneers. Amongst them
was the Cox family, which struck its roots
in the soil thereabouts when the world was
over a century younger. In June, 1811, a
small boy (he grew up in course of time)
named George Cox wrote from Mulgoa to
his chum Tom Hassall, thus: “In your last
to me you said you would like to have a
bantom Hen, which I shall give you with
plesure at any time you want it. The
rabits are not doing quite so well as we
could wish, but for all that I shall not
despair.” Since then bunny has done so well
that a lot of people have despaired.
Cricketer Frank Laver was married the
other day, and he and Mrs. Frank are honey-
mooning at the Carrington, Katoomba. The
popular big-fellow married one of the pretty
Major girls from Kiama. Another sister is
Mrs. W. Keogh, of Warrena, Coonamble, who
usually decorates Sydney race meetings with
some delightful dressing.
A recent meandering bit of fiction by
Rachel Hayward is rather to the point just
now. because much of the fiction is located
in France. “Letters from La Bas” (Ro.v-
eroft Library) concentrate their wrath on
Lyons. “Its factories and smoke, and the
two melancholy rivers, and the bitter winds
and the money-grabbing have made the
Lyonais ill-mannered, anaemic and consump-
tive.” The same thing may be said of many
manufacturing towns, yet manufactures seem
t( be unavoidable. Rachel cheers up when
she digs her pen into a florid description of
more lively parts. As a lady-help in a smart
restaurant at Nice she writes:—
Yesterday I went to say the Bon .Tour to the
Gsiribaldi statue. He’s all right, dear man, but the
females at the base of the pedestal are very second-
rate. . ..
Later she says :
Here I am, six kilometers from Lille, planted
securely in the heart of the Pays Noir. The English
colony lives all in a heap in the impasse des Anglais.
....This colony is unique. Fifty years ago Sir
Frederick Haines came to Lille, and built the mill
and settled there. He was married and had 14
children. He brought out his tame chaplain, who
still lives at the mill, though he no longer works, of
course. lie married twice, and had 23 children.
Then the two families, who speak with a broad
Lancashire accent, began to marry each other.
Maud Allan has tested her recently-injured
limb in 11 successful hop, twirl and dance
recitals in Westralia. The limb being now
restored to its former nimbleness, the Sydney
season opens on October 24. The Theatre
Royal is to house the show, which will in-
clude the musical Cherniavsky trio.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, Octobek 12, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Our very dressiest aristocrat lias just liad
a £lOOO writ served upon her. The
trouble centres round an alleged gift
of flowers tendered by one of the
noblewomen to the other. They are
said to have been handed through a closed
bedroom window—in pots. The lurking
demon jealousy is believed to he at the
bottom of the painful business. One sus-
pected the other, or the other suspected one
of something frivolous, and hence the Greek
gift of horticulture, and unpleasantness
generally. What stirring lives our old
noblesse do lead, to be sure!
The Vanderkelens (he was Belgian Consul
here) were in their native land when the
world went mad. Their son Claude, who is
in Melbourne, heard that dad was interpret-
ing and doing other odd jobs at the War
< tftice in Brussels, but news has now arrived
that they escaped to England with the first
hatch of refugees. So all is well.
Dr. Douglas Shields has been made consult-
ing surgeon to the British Navy. lie has two
colleagues—Sir Alfred Fripp and fair Watson
Cheyne —and George V. and the Admiralty
are the appointees-in-chief. So. you see that
oor ain bonnie medical boy continues to stand
well forward in the light.
The St. Kilda Palais permits the one-step
and the hesitation-waltz on Monday nights
now, under martial law. Anyone caught
nigging is shot out for vulgarity. On the
first Monday night exhibitions of the per-
missible brands of hop were given by a clean
young man in white socks and a hesitation
fairy in white satin, slit to show sliell-pink
inside covers and an infantile sash round her
athletic knees. The gyrations are not war-
ranted to rouse a speck of perspiration in the
stoutest subject. The operator mostly walks
Backwards and then stands with one foot
poised in the air like a thoughtful rooster
yawning between feed-times. Or else he (or
she) walks forward and poises. Ex-Mayoress
T. .T. Davey, nearly covered by a purple
Japanese wrapper, was there on the Exhibi-
tion night, with her husband and some other
council folk. But no one troubles about
notables at the Beach hop-shop. They’re all-
too busy slithering round in white socks,
ninon top-deckings 15 sizes too big for them,
and hats which are so shriekingly fashionable
that they nearly miss getting there at all,
and hut for a dispensation of Providence
would be tea-cosies or frying-pans. As for
stockings, I haven’t seen so much, or so
many, all at once since my nursery days.
Lesley Madden is back from ruralising at
the Pat Osbornes’ N.S.W. station. One
reason is that she is better, the other that
Mrs. Ruby Pat and her dapper little hus-
band were sworn, or, at any rate, solemnly
vowed, to go through the horrors of the
Spring racing campaign in Sydney. Their
whilom guest is staying for the present with
the S. T. Stauglitons.
Mrs. Artist Fred McCubbin and some other
Repertory dames combined Charity and Cul-
ture rather neatly the other afternoon.
While the helpful creatures wrestled with
face-washers and woolly socks, extracts from
Repertoried authors were read to them. This
edifying show occurred at the Club Rooms at
Oxford Chambers.
When a German submarine sank the Brit-
ish cruiser Hogue in the North Sea the other
day the husband of a Maoriland girl
answered the last call, lie was Lieutenant
Renniek, one of Capt. Scott’s staff on the
last Antarctic expedition. While in M.L. lie
became engaged to Miss Paterson, youngest
daughter of A. S. Paterson, .one of the best-
known merchants in Seawtcli Dunedin. A
few months ago Miss Paterson went Fog-
wards, accompanied by her mother and
sister, and in April was married to her sailor-
man. The honeymoon was hardly over when
war called him away, and now the bride of
a few months ago is a widow.
The opening of the Federal Parliament
was a crowded hour of dowdy life. It was
timed for 3 p.m. (the day, of course, being
Thursday) but M.P. wives and admirers
had nearly filled the auditorium spaces by
two o’clock. The crush was awful, and not
one of the faces belonging to it was worth
while selling on a postcard. (You may con-
sider this harsh, my dear, but I am a
truthful woman or nothing.) Everyone
attached to Parliamentary notorieties by
marriage, accident, design or otherwise was
t here, hut they had brought along scarcely
a frock worth mention, much to my annoy-
ance. Why can’t our legislators attend to
this part of their duties?
The G.-G. looked well in his best party
uniform (the red one) and a feathered
helmet. Of all his frocks I think I prefer
this, with its fine blaze of color relieved by
simple white trimmings. Rear-Admiral
(Teswell and Captain Ticket] also presented
alluring figures as they stood at attention
with their cocked hats tucked under then-
arms; and Aide Foxton, Major Stewart and
Colonel Hughes were ii brilliant lot in their
frogs and buttons and brass fixings. The
Speech was. interesting; not so much for its
matter as for the potentate's way of deliver-
ing it. Ilis soft, burring accent with the
suppressed “r’s,” and so forth, is very
taking.
Lady Helen was in the State pen,
sombrely graceful in black, with white
touches, some gorgeous Ferguson sapphires
and a black plumed hat. With her was Miss
Mandeville in mushroom covers, edged with
tartan, and a small pink-rosed hat. Mrs.
Andy Fisher, in quantities of navy blue silk,
expanded proudly behind a pillar. Dame
Forrest in blue, with a white hat, chatted
over the vice-regal barrier, and Mrs. “Billy”
Hughes, in champagne silk dabbed with blue,
was discovered in a more distant corner.
The G. F. Pearce matron was furnished in
black satin. Dame Creswell, who was sit-
ting with Commander Thring in some
specially blessed seats, wore white with
black lace. Mrs. Tudor was in black silk
crowned with yellow daisies, and crowds of
also-theres were trodden on in the confusion.
Melba went on from the rp H. Kellys’
place at Bowral (N.S.W.) to the Agar
Wynnes’ Neerin Neerin station, in the Vic-
torian western district. George Armstrong
and his pretty wife and the Lemprieres are
with her. Hard, unrelenting toil, repre-
sented by motoring and bridge and excla-
matory chat in re the horrors of the war,
are the order of the day.
Fx-Customs-chief Wollaston returned
from Europe by the Themistoeles, bringing
with him a new English wife. The Wollas-
ton daughter has also married in Europe.'
She had only one week’s wedded bliss when
her husband, Captain Georges Ferrand. of
the French Field Artillery, had to make
rapid tracks for the front.
Some more Themistocies passengers were
Miss Deakin, sister of Alfred, and his young-
est hope, Vera of the gazelle-like orbs. They
narrowly escaped the war plague, being in
Vienna when it broke out.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Thursday’s meeting of the S.A. Medical Board pro-
vided Adelaide with another Dr. Hamilton. There
are four already, and there were five till the death
of Dr. A. A. Hamilton a few weeks ago. This one
comes from Melbourne, and is called William.
It has been a serious-minded week, enlivened only
by the activities of Miss Barnes, the Australian sec-
retary of the Y.W.C.A., and of Air. Reade, of the
Town Planning Association. Miss Barnes specialises
on the moral guidance of the young female. Mr.
Reade has filled in his spare time by having a mild
row with Alderman Cohen. The alderman was
enraged, in a gentle .sort of way, at Mr. Reade’s
references to Adelaide’s slums. Re (Cohen) says
there aren’t any. To which the adversary's only
possible reply, of course, was that Mr. Cohen and
he evidently used different dictionaries.
Our old friend the Drought is still with us. Most
of the gardens look like Belgium alter a recent visit
from that astonishing celestial emissary, the Kaiser;
and the lawns resemble hack-yards. Meanwhile a
Jamestown naturalist has written to the papers to
say that he has received private and reliable infor-
mation from the ants that it will rain—hard and
soon. I hope the drains are all clear in anticipation
of the coming flood.
On Saturday afternoon at St. Paul.’s Church, Pult-
ney-street, AV. B. Carr, stockbroker and racing man,
was married to Mrs. Herbert Either, of Glenelg, who
was originally a Miss Turnbull. They kept their
plans very dark, and were safely away in the direc-
tion of Melbourne before the Social blood-hounds had
got within miles of the scent. The groom is popular
hereabouts, and was for a good many years the
Register’s sporting editor.
Sister Snelling, who left for Europe about a year
ago, has resigned her position as superintendent of
nurses at the Adelaide Children’s Hospital. She is
trying to get to the front. Her place here is to be
taken by the second in command. Sister' Kildael.
The Minda fete was opened at Victoria Park on
Saturday by the Symon dame.
Mr. Owen Smyth has had another accident. On
Thursday lie collided with a wind-blown sheet of
iron on a 20-foot scaffolding. He nearly destroyed
the iron, but emerged unscathed himself. Tt takes,
more than half a ton of falling metal to iirjurc one of
his youth and Strength.,
Pianist Doris Madden damaged one of her
valuable fingeys the ..then day. She stuck
it through a' ’window-pane, tints violating
one of Bach’s Rules .for piano-players, viz.,
“It is forbidden (verbolen) to stick the
finger through glass, or other dangerousness
(Uefiihreichkeit) The Edward Golls, who
Jive a ..few doors away, came to the rescue
with buckets, towels, etc., and the injured
member, which was. uninsured, is now con-
valescent.
Two more Cliveden engagements are fill-
ing the lifts_ and stairways of the place with
bills and frills and senatorial objurgations.
Mabel Hicks, of the drapering dynasty of
that name, is to be married to Alexander
Stewart Morton on the 18tli. And Madeline
Rowan,'- a daughte;f£%f the clever flower
painter; and the late Andrew Rowan, pro-
poses to tread the path of matrimony with
one Ilervey Hopwood, of Ceylon. The
Andrew Rowans have vineyards around
Yering and Lilydale.
Kuna Syme, a daughter of the Yovke
Symes, of Balwyn, is to he married on
November IU. The other person implicated
is Jim Murray, who is a bank manage 1 when
he is not sustaining the role of Loch invar.
The Expeditionary Forces held a sports
meeting at Broadmeadows on Tuesday after-
noon. There is an idea abroad that the
event is to be an annual one. However, the
curious turned up in hordes, just as though
the warriors were off to the front within the
next six months or so. The officers had a
special ’tea enclosure. It wasn’t any differ-
ent from the rest of the hot, brown paddock,
but it was roped in, and that gave it an air
of distinction. The show was mostly dust.
Incidentally there were sunburnt soldiers
jumping, running, marchinj? and blowing
into bagpipes. And then there was more
dust. No one thought of wearing a sun-
shade because everyone—and there were hun-
dreds and hundreds of ones —-carried a swag
of buns and other home-made forage for the
campers. The road was a mass of ’buses,
traps, motors —and dust. Also tiie trains
gushed forth other perspiring crowds, and
further dust. The tug-of-war was the star
item. The participants were picked men,
so huge and brown and grimy that the more
or less clean visitors looked like freshly
washed toys them. The dust—but
perhaps I that subject.
Masson and W. Baldwin
Spencer waited on Premier Alec Peacock
last week/to-thank him and the State Min-
istry for tbjijf kindness to the British Scien-
tists. AlfijWgave one of his famous giggles,
of utter surprise, when they
handed him back £GOO of the grant made to
the Committee for onto -unment purposes.
However, he took.the rebate with both hands.
Did you ever, hear of a politician acting
differently ? '
\ The Jack Grices’ daughter Hilda is re-
ported to be safe in England. This is cheer-
ing to her friends here, who had begun to
picture her cowering in one of the dank and
ill-ventilated cellars of a beleaguered Belgian
city.
Muriel Larking, who left Toorak about
four years ago as a flapper, is back again,
with long frocks and a husband. The lat-
ter’s name is Matthews, and he and she will
inhabit the maternal residence at Woori-
goleen for a while. Mrs, Larking and
another daughter are in London so as to be
in touch with the two Larking sons, who are
ax the front, or thereabouts'. The front is
almost entirely thereabouts.
Mrs. Boeuvet, now in Melbourne, has a
bigger personal interest in the war than most.
Her brother. Major Eustace Jameson, is at
the Front; also his three sons. The eldest.
Captain Kenneth Jameson, who did well, in
the Boer war, is Brigade-Major of the lioyal
Field Artillery’s Eastern Army Corps,
Pretty little Mrs. Henry Cornish, the
young person who is always being portrait-
painted, has had six weeks in hospital with
neuritis; And now she has been re-sentenced
to a further month. Some people have all
the luck.
I hear that Captain Gordon Smith, R.N.,
is to pilot.one of the departing troop-ships,
lie was anchored here as naval, member of
the LonSdale-street Defence Office, and will
leave behind an attractive brown-eyed wife—
that is, if Rumor does not lie and he is really
going. A -
Doris Cooke,, one of our young musical
persons, has had a Song published by Paling’s
in Sydney. It is something in the ragtime
line, about “Baby Dear,” arm it was sung by
Miss Humphries at the big patriotic concert
in the Collingwood Town Hall last week.
It made a terrific success, .so that the bur-
nished locks of the young composer positively
crinkled with delight.
Caulfield Guineas Saturday was fairly
cheerful, but. the dressing was not so much
“off” as absolutely .awful. Our Best People
seem to be competing with each other to
discover which can show the biggest supply
of sackcloth and the most conspicuous gar-
nishing of ashes. This is the 1914 vintage of
patriotism. The- blue-plush and wicker-work
pews held the G.-G., in a tall hat and fittings
to match ; and Lady Helen, in plain grey,
livened up with black velvet and a wide black
hat growing a healthy crop of grey feathers.
Governor Stanley wore grey- fore and aft, as
usual. Norman Hodges, the latest thing in
aides, the gentle Foxton Help and secretary
Luttrell gave the fair scene an added touch of
beauty.
There were quantities of perfectly-profiled
and yellow-gloved male Baillieus scattered
about the Lawn and Bird Cage. (Really, this
family is so ornamental, it is a positive treat
to sit and watch it gyrate.) Geo. Fairbairn,
in brown, to match his moustache, conversed
sadly with M.L.A. Norman BayleS, who
affected a tender grey spring garb. Mrs.
George looked unwontedly depressed in dark
navy blue and black jet headgear. The
Buchanan couple were there —he in a straw
hat and a ruined-looking macintosh ; she in
a strange grey check garment and a black
hat which looked as though it had been
in the macintosh’s company when the acci-
dent happened. There was a violent shud-
der through the stand when Norman Falk-
iner’s Altar Boy fell in the Steeplechase.
However, the jockey got up and walked off,
after lying for a minute or two in a
crumpled attitude, and the horrified millinery
buzzed fashionably again.
The younger division outshone their
seniors in the way of smartness. After a
certain age it is hard to look smart unless
the rules of the game permit you to be pal-
pably expensive, and, as 1 remarked before,
all that sort of thing is barred this season.
White tailor-mades and severe small hats
scored best, one of the smartest of these being
sported by the Fred Cooke matron. The
O’Hara daughters were neat in sage green
(Betty) and a large fur coat (Nan). Airs.
Tom Hogan, in white-liatted navy blue, shed
cheerfulness and vigor round a jolly circle.
Eilie Appleton (who was Eilie Robson, a
sister of clever Repertory-acting Allie Rob-
son) looked nice in a white cloth suit. The
Brunton dame wore coronation blue. And
then there were the usual oddities. Airs.
Nunn made a violent splash in a cape of
screaming Ala-mie-rosette —mostly rosette. It
blew out like an undirigible balloon, carving
a rosy passage-way through every other color
on the Lawn. Last Saturday’s giant osprey
was transplanted to another hat of fierce
emerald green, und it had an equally expen-
sive rival, which was worn above an ermine
coat of fearsome costliness.
Tom Carter, the long, gentle brush-
brother, got back from Europe on August ! >.
lie brought with him a huge swag of work,
including some fine enamels, painted clnna and
stained glass, and fully intended to have ex-
hibited them by now. But illness smote
him, and he still looks like the shadow of a
tired hairpin. The collapse is said to have
been due to overwork.
Nurse Alay Nicholson, of Hos-
pital, was one of the first to leave for France
with the Australian Field Hospital. She
was in London with Dr. Fryatt (who worked
an X-ray machine at the Alelbourne Hospi-
tal) and his wife when the war began.
A cafe cliantant is happening to-day
(Thursday, October 15) at the Oriental
Hotel, and every bean raked in goes to the
Belgian and French Funds. Airs. Alex.
Landale is the generalissimo of the move-
ment. Mrs. Winifred Forbes is its hon. sec-
retary, and Aliss Edna Armytage and Aliss
Thornley are Alajor-Generals of the
teacups. The cliantant part of the
show is to be led by Alaggie Stirling
and daughter Alary, Daisy Jerome, and as
many good-natured professionals as can be
enlisted or commandeered.

Exposure to hot winds and sun makes the
nerves and muscles of the face tired and life-
less. and the skin shrivelled, wrinkled and
unhealthy.
If anyone with a sallow, blotchy, wrinkled
or pimply complexion will only take a little
trouble in following the directions here given
they will find a marvellous improvement in
their complexion. Get some Puritol Wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply at
night, washing off in the morning with warm
water and soap. Then lap a little cold
water 10 times upon the face with the hands,
allowing it to get thoroughly round the
closed eyes. The treatment should be fol-
lowed out in every detail to ensure success,
and undoubtedly accounts for many of the
clear complexions so much admired by those
who do not yet know the secret. See that
you get the right kind, it will not injure the
most delicate complexion.*

POINTS
The N.S.W. Government has got the loan
business down to a fine point. It has been
borrowing of late at the rate of £10,000,000
a year. And it has also borrowed nearly
£4,000,000 in a temporary way on the
strength of the permanent borrows it intends
to do. In other words “the loan account is
overdrawn” to the extent of nearly
£4,000,000. This amount isn’t the real lOU.
It is only tlie deputy lOU, or the loan’s
understudy.
THE TOOTHLESS TYKE.
The Northern Territory was dismissed from the
Speech at the opening- of Parliament with the assur-
ance that earnest attention was being given to its
effective development by railway and other public
works.
THE D OG: “Now, if I only had a set of
votes to bite with!”
Far, far away in the distant past the
then Victorian Government, in consequence
of unpleasant disclosures of mismanagement
at the Queen Victoria Infectious Diseases
Hospital, decided to have a managing com-
mittee of 12, of whom it would appoint six.
It hasn’t nominated them yet. and apparently
never will; but the other day the hopeless
municipal councils of the metropolis chose
their half-dozen —and five of the six were
members of the old committee! As one of
the customs of the latter was to assure rela-
tives of deceased persons that the victims
were “progressing favorably” a fresh burst of
public fury on the subject of this institution
may be expected before long.
If there is any truth in the cable that
German military authorities are dissatisfied
with Von Moltke, Chief of Staff, and have
partly superseded him, then the demoralisa-
tion of Teutonic cocksureness has set in ;
and when a cocksure fighter begins to enter-
tain misgivings, he might as well count him-
self out. There was no British belittling of
the enemy when the war began. John Bull,
of course, said he was going to win, but
neither lie nor the French, nor the Russians
skited about the crushing blows they were
going to administer right away. On the
other hand, the Kaiser’s swashbucklers were
going to cakewalk over “General French’s
contemptible little army.” capture Paris,
swallow Belgium and bring hack a victorious
2.000.005' of troops to smash the Russians
on Russian soil. Now that none of these
things have been done they are blaming Von
Moltke. Chief of Staff —a pretty sure sign of
early decomposition of confidence.
Every 48 hours or so one or other of
Holman’s Ministers bursts in with a new
scheme for spending another of Cohen’s
millions. The last brilliant idea was to
throw a herd of steam ploughs on to half a
million acres on the extreme edge of the
N S.W. far-western wheat belt and make a
pot of money out of the high wheat prices
that .are going to rule next year, incident-
ally, of course, absorbing a few hundred
unemployed. It was a great scheme, and it
looked magnificent from Fitt-street. But
then the absurd persons who think they
know a lot about wheat because they have
been growing it all their lives asked whether
the steam ploughs would root up the big
green and dry timber, and do' in a few
minutes what takes usually three years—
with ringbarking, and suekering, and final
burning-oii and fallowing. Anyhow, if the
State has half a million acres of unoccupied
wheat land capable of giving a crop next
year, what excuse does it offer for withhold-
ing the treasure, and driving 500. or so
people to apply every few months for half a
dozen scrub blocks which can’t give a crop
for years? Also, with all this arable land
available, why has the Government locked it
up and driven people to the private sub-
divider, where they have had to pay extra-
vagant prices, besides hanging millstones of
debt round their necks? Either the present
wheat-growing scheme is quite mad or the
Holman Government has been a fine friend
to the land shark.
BACK TO THE BARROW.
THE DISQUALIFIED S HOVER: “Thank
Heaven! This is a job I DO know
something about."
Heaven only knows what Germany didn’t
sell to this tired country. So far The
Bulletin hasn’t found fresh eggs on the
fist; but actually last year the Ma State
bought just on half a ton of dried egg
albumen, or yolk and albumen combined.
There are many humble, unconsidered suf-
ferers of the war. When the bombardment
of Antwerp commenced, the lions and tigers
and snakes and harmless necessary elephants
in the splendid Zoological Gardens were
killed. There was a ehance that some casual
shell might burst ’their cages, and that they
might rVin loose in the streets, and bite tlie
hack part of some Belgian soldier who was
sufficiently busy in front. No Belgian soldier
can do much good to a German in the east
if a camel is rushing at him from the west.
So (lie poor old animals had to go. But it
was the limit when the lunatic asylums were
opened and the deranged folk were told to
run for the Dutch border. Nothing better
could be done amid the horrors of strife,
hut it was rough on the lunatics.
A harassed person signing herself “House-
keeper” wrote the other day to a Parkes
(N.S.W.) paper asking why bread was 4d.
a loaf in her own wheat-growing district,
while in Sydney, which doesn’t grow wheat,
the figure is 3kl. Evidently poor, worried
Mrs. “Housekeeper” doesn’t understand the
policy of her own State. The pride’ of the
loaf "is fixed by law at old- as regards the
counties of Cumberland and Northumber-
land —the ones which contain Sydney and
Newcastle and the congested populations—
while it may be 2s. 31 d- anywhere else,
because Congestion is the Government
policy. If any special advantage in the way
of cheap food can he given to Sydney and
Newcastle it tends to attract people there
and to strip the country districts of people.
And despite all its theories and professions
about decentralisation the great business of
the Holman Government is to attract the
whole human race to Sydney and Newcastle,
even if the loaf costs 3s. 6d. at Parkes.
What’s in the wind? Beckett, M.L.C.,
was endeavoring to drag a statement of
policy regarding Melbourne Tramways from
the Minister, Hagelthorn. Said Beckett:
“The question must be dealt with in a busi-
ness-like way, and one authority should
have control of all lines.” Thereupon hon-
orary Minister Baillieu interjected: “But
the lease with the Melbourne Tramways has
not yet run out.” Beckett remarked that
Baillieu, as a business man, must see the
necessity for making provision ahead for so
large an undertaking. To which Baillieu
replied hastily; “I understand that you
cannot get the Melbourne Tramways in
1916.” What does Baillieu know? And if
there are difficulties ahead, does Bail.ieu pro-
pose to surrender to them? If he does, the
Government he belongs to is in for a hot
lime.
“J. J.”: Now that the tumult and the
shouting have died, it is clear that quiet,
capable organisation was largely responsible
for the improved position of the Australian
Labor party in N.S.W. After the 1910 elec-
tion the party’s hat became too small for
its head, and pride went before a fail. The
smash made tlie politicians wiser, and this
time the regular P.L.L. organisation, which
isn’t tlie keenest in the world, Was supple-
mented'by a Parliamentary Campaign Com-
mittee —ciiairmaned by W. M. Hughes, with
Calls as secretary. Special attention was
paid to weak seats —Illawarra, Macquarie.
Gwydir and the like. These were retained
by increased majorities, and Riverina and
Werriwa won back. In recognition of these
services, Catts was put in the running for
the Ministry this time, and only just missed
a place.
English papers scornfully print this Ger-
man maxim as a proof of Teutonic nai row
ness: —- . .
Never forget when you purchase a foreign-made
article, though it only cost a pienmg, you dmimi.n
the fortune of your country hv your act.
Little more than 30 years ago Germany had
only the same population as I ranee.
dav it has had strength enough to stand up
for nearly three months against Britain,
France. Russia and Belgium. The policy
may have been narrow, hut it has carried
Germany a long way.
Some wheat speculators got out of a tight
corner when the N.S.W. Government fixed
the price of wheat at 4s. 2d. a bushel. 4 ney
had done a gamble, and were pledged to
supply wheat to millers aud others at about
4s. 3d. -Tliev expected, when they made the
deal, to buy for less, but the drought hap-
nened, and the war happened, and they saw
the horrible prospect of purchasing wheat
from the farmer at ss. fid. and selling it to
their clients at 4s. 3d. Then the Holman
Government rushed in and compelled the
droughtrstricken farmer to sell at 4s. 2d., and
the speculative shark wept tears of joy, and
said that nothing better liad happened to him
since the time of Moses Iscariot.
One of the humors of the war is the
appearance every third day or so of a printed
screech to the effect that some foreign coun-
try or other is determined to maintain its
strict neutrality. The' proud screech comes
always from the agent of a foreign trail-
ing firm, and the commercial traveller who
makes it evidently reckons that neutrality is
a virtue worth. 14 cheers and a barrel-full
of orders. The Allies, curiously enough,
don’t puff their chests and ask ns to con
sider wliat fine fellows they are—in busi-
ness and otherwise. It is reserved for
people who are not lifting a finger to help
us in our trouble to tell us how deserving
of our business they are in return for their
great consideration in keeping tlieir bayonets
out of our stomachs.
As far as it lias gone, which certainly
isn’t very far, the N. 8. Wales State Bakery
makes a poor show on paper; for though it
started off with a ready-made connection,
and has no bad debt to provide for, it was
£347 to the bad on June 30. Practically
it supplies only public institutions, and the
trouble is that public institutions are all
over i lie shop, wherefore the Central bakery
is humping the same snag that made a
wreck of the co-operative ovens in Mel-
bourne. However, commercially the tiling
is as sound as ever it was: and if one big
Private Enterprise co. were running all
these public institutions, it is dead-certain
that it wouldn’t rely on other private enter-
prise to supply its bread. Just as the
C.S.R. Co. has its own engineering works
and’ the Broken Hill Prop, its own coke
plant, that co. would have its own bread
factory. Whether it would run the thing
as the State bakery is being run is another
matter.
THE GERMAN EAGER ,
As it is, and as it will be.
“II.B.”: Brothers, haul down the en -
sign of the dove of peace, and raise the skull
and crossbones. The Society of Friends is
saving its face in England by publishing big
advts. to the effect that, “while we stand
firmly to the belief that, the method of force
is no solution of any question, we hold that
the present moment is not one for criticism,
hut for devoted service to our nation.” The
non-resister is about the most savage person
going when resistance is the one thing need-
ful. The trouble is lie has never learned
how to be savage to good effect.
There were <02,320 votes cast in
the Federal elections in New South Wales.
In the voting for the Senate 34,910 were
informal or unaccounted for —quite a lot
of people tear up the Senate ballot-paper
because they can’t remember the “hunch
thev wish to vote for. The leading Labor
man was 221 S votes ahead of the leading
Liberal, and the furthest south Laborite
secured 5837 votes more than the most
Antarctic Liberal. Of the W 57.412 effective
votes, the average was tor J^aboi
and 329.5)69 for Liberals, showing a net
difference in favor of Labor of 7094,
DRY ROT.
Moreover, the capital lends itself with singular
felicity to official reconstruction owing to the essential
and perennial futurity of the thing. As man never
is, but always to he, blessed, so the federal city is
never even subjected to a real practical beginning, but
remains ever in the incalculable future.
Sydney TELEGRAPH.
A USTRALIA: “A bloke might as well hack it
out with an axe as leave it writing here.”
Ever since the war started Premier Pea-
cock, of Victoria, has been pestered with
requests from employers to suspend the
Wages Boards’ determinations. So far he lias
stood firm, assuring the applicants that if
their business has fallen off by, say, one-
third, it is quite proper they should pay a
third less wages and work their employees
a third fewer hours, putting each off one
week in every three. It is the obvious and
proper course; but somehow it hasn’t
awakened any enthusiasm among those
employers who wanted to pay their employ-
ees half wages and keep them working full
time.
The habit that trades unions have acquired
of illegally striking against each other, as
well as illegally striking against employers,
doesn’t simplify the industrial situation.
Bast week certain members of the Seamen’s
Union, on board the steamship Canberra, at
Melbourne, struck against a cook, and
refused to go to sea unless be was dis-
charged. The Cooks’ Union declared that
there would be a general strike of the food-
ruiners if he was discharged. So 55 seamen
went ashore, and the vessel was hung up,
and all the passengers were suspended in-
definitely. This sort of civil war may yet be
the destruction of unionism. A house
divided against itself is liable to blow up.
"MADE IN GERMANY.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From Biscay Bay to old Japan
I beard the sullen cannon roar,
In menace dire to hapless man,
W hile ruin spread from shore to shore;
And, liuu-velling- what the cause might be,
Was told ’twas “Made in Germany]”
I saw Louvain in ashes laid.
And heard her homeless orphans cry;
Beliiijd the barbarous William’s raid
I heard the wail that rent tlie sky;
\r:d, asking- how such things could be
Was "answered —“Made in Germany!”
In RJieims there blazed a noble shrine.
And Europe lmng- licr head in shame
To think it came of “Right Divine,”
Tlsis murderous, all-devouring flame;
I cried: “How came this curse to be?”
Again ’twas “Made in Germany I”
Full twenty thousand Belgian dead
Lay thick as leaves around Liege;
The fields were bare, the streets were red,
In token of the spoiler's rage.
Again the answer came to me:
“This Wreck was Made in Germany !”
From Mons to Paris famed and fair
There hung of smoke and murk a pall ;
The smell of death was in the air,
The Grave was Lord and Chief of all;
I wondered how such things could be —
“ ’Twas made,” they said, “in Germany!”
I dreamt I dropped to deepest Hell
And saw tlie damned in torment there;
I was not mazed that such befell,
For Earth was now the Devil’s lair;
I merely said : “Ah, so I see,
More proofs of German industry.”

In attempting to rig the local wheat market the
State Government is in danger of burning its fingers.
The wheat that it cornered at 4s. 2d. per bushel
threatens to (iron considerably below that figure...-
There is no telling what London operators may do,
and Mr. Hall, the Attorney-General, expresses the
fear that he may have to take 3s. lOd. for the wheat
that he seized at 4s. 2d. —Sydney D. T.
“Please give me a penny!” the poor orphan said.
“And what will yon do with it? Will you buy
bread ?”
“Oh, no!” wailed the orphan, and stamped both his
feet,
“I want to make up what I’ll lose on my wheat!
Nothing but wheat!
Nothing but wheat!
I'm just a poor orphan who’s bought too much
wheat!”
“Please give me a shilling and tuppence, kind sir!
Or my angry stepdad will shortly occur
And start to raise Gain! Oh, I don’t wish to meet
My stepfather while I’m losing on wheat!
Nothing but wheat!
Nothing but wheat!
Oh, pity an orphan who’s loaded with wheat 1”
“And who is your stepdad, by poor orphan boy?”
“The voter’s my stepdad! He’s out of employ,
And I’m quite sure he’d bring out his deadliest gun
If 1 told him half a loaf’s better than none.
Better than none !
Better than none!
Who said half a loaf was much better than none?”

‘•lnvincible” Engines win golden opinions wherever they so. Here are a few
testimonials from our 24-page book of similar testimony:
We have much pleasure in letting you know
that, our lighter Annie Love is giving the utmost
satisfaction. Driven b.y one of your (40h.p.
Model “S” 3-cylinder) “Invincible" Motors, it
does the trip between our Mills on the Lane
Cove and our Sydney Wharf —a distance of eight
miles—twice a day, the time of journey being
55 minutes. We have had up to 40 tons of
cargo on board, but the average would be 25
tons, and we have towed punts with 70 tons.
Needless to say, these results are extremely satis-
factory. The engine runs with the greatest
regularity, and does not give any trouble what-
ever.

Regarding my 4-Sh.p. Mode] “R" “Invincible”
Engine which you supplied, and which I have
had in constant use for the last 18 months, I
am more than satisfied with same. My boat
is not a toy, but part and parcel of my living ;
consequently, the engine must be reliable and
economical. The work at times is heavy and
continuous. If I wanted another engine I
should certainly not hesitate about taking an
“Invincible.” My boat is not a light boat: it is
24ft. long. 6ft. Sin. beam, and draws about
3ft. 6in., is fitted with awning, and glassed in
front. Engine drives her at a good seven miles
an hour, and that with a sea and a good, stiff
breeze. (Sgd.) JOHN WILLIAMS, Jun..
Bav View, Pittwater, N.S.W.
I respectfully wish to inform you that the
8-12h.p. Engine has now been in use about
twelve months, and has given every possible
satisfaction; the working of engine is simplicity,
■ combined with very economical expenses for
| Petrol. This engine runs direct off the mag-
, neto, and never requires more than about two

of 1050/- for oils, and £l/17/6 repairs on en-
gine during the two years. 1 have never had a
stop wjth her, always working smoothly and
very easy to master. I had an expert to look
over her last week, and he reported that she was
in as. good a condition to-day as the day she
was installed. I think the above figures are
recommendation enough to anvone, so no need
for me to say any more about" her.

Re the 12b.p., 4-cylinder Model “G” Engine
purchased 18 months ago. The engine has given
me every satisfaction. It drives my launch 10
miles an hour, without exertion ; only the other
day I towed the schooner Mclntyre,With 2500
bags aboard, to the entrance of our harbor,
which is 44 miles, in 14 hours. The total
cost for repairs is 2/-, which was a new phosphor
bronze spindle which drives water pump.
Should I require another engine, I should cer-
tainly buy a 4-cylinder “Invincible.”

AN ATHLETE’S PRAISE.
FINDS DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS INVALUABLE WHEN
TRAINING.
Mr. James A. Weaver, of 108 Smith
Street, Mount Lawley, Perth, W.A., writes :
“Having used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root lills
I am in a position to speak from practical
experience. Your pills have always given
me satisfactory results in warding off the
little ills of life, and as a blood purifier
they are splendid. Being a long-distance
runner I find them valuable when training,
as they go a long way towards making me
fit for'a strenuous race, by taking an occa-:
sional dose. You may use this testimonial
as you desire.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a purely
vegetable preparation and their action is
mild and gentle. They give you clean
bowels, a healthy stomach, and blood that is
rich and red. For complaints arising from
imnerfect digestion and impure blood these
pills are unexcelled.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
With 21 acceptances for the Caulfield Cup
the possibility of a strange turn-up is greater than it
was last year, when the two favorites fought out the
finish. Moreover, there are so many highly-fancied
ones left that the punter who tries to ‘ pick it in
twice” may be badly beaten without having to suffer
a great surprise. And to back more than two m such
a race is an unreasonable gamble. Out oCa dozen
undeniables the writer picks Aurifer, Sir Alwynton,
Anna Carlovna, Rathlea, St. Carwyne and Garlin, and
takes
ST. CARWYNE
ANNA CARLOVNA
for his two. It can be argued that Sir Alwynton,
having twice beaten St. Carwyne last season, is likely
to beat him again at the weights; but the latter s
form tit Randwick indicates that he has come on
wonderfully of late. In the Metropolitan the son ot
St. Alwyne and Carwee. ran third, after he hail lost
ground by boring wide. At Caulfield he will be
racing the opposite way of the course, and should be
suited by a position ■ near the rails. With 41b. less
on his back than he carried at Randwick he promises
to get a good position and stick to it to the bitter
end. Punters in search of a coincidence will note
that Aurifer ran third for the Metrop. last year before
winning the Caulfield Cup, and Flavinius in 1910, and
Maranui in 1908 did likewise.

“Cough Drop”: When will Melbourne
punters tire of backing the liot from Eric
Connolly’s stable (which stable, by the way, is never
represented at the Sydney meetings) ? L A. Con-
nolly’s hot stuff usually burns the fingers of the fools
who touch it. Last year and this, the notorious Sea
Prince and the hardly less uncertain Anna Carlovna
have been beaten more often than not, when they
started at odds-on, even money, or only aishade better
than evens. A fair price about one of Connolly s is
out of tlie question when he has backed it. As a rule,
ho bets so heavily that the price offered to his blind
followers is preposterously short, yet they rush in to
shorten it still more. His dealings with the book-
makers are extensive. He backs other horses, as well
as his own, before the race and whilst it is being run.
Within the past few weeks history has repeated ltselt
as regards Anna Carlovna. She always starts favonte
—perhaps a trifle less hot at the starting moment
than she was half an hour previously—and the
calendar shows that she has been beaten time after
time. Following Eric Connolly’s horses is a bad
game for the little punters, but they will do it. lhe
gees win races—Sea Prince and Carlovna had five
good wins between them during October and Novem-
ber last year—but there is no profit for the punter
who backs them every time they start at a short
vrice At time of writing, Anna Carlovna is a likely
starter for the Caulfield Cup, in which race she ran
second last year. Well, if Connolly backs the brown
mare, the public will get a small price about a fair
chance; and if ho doesn’t back her heavily the
public will get-a bigger price, but will only win it a
miracle comes to pass. In short, when the public
wins on Connolly’s horses the win is too poor to
make up for all the times it loses.
* * * *
Guineas Day racing at Caulfield threw
verv little new light on the Cup situation, though it
confirmed the idea that Anna Carlovna would probably
start favorite for the big event next Saturday. The
mare won the Caulfield Stakes (nine furlongs) from
Uncle Sam, whilst Aleconner, who had beaten her
on the same terms a week previously, was lust
nowhere this time. After the race Anna was quoted
at a point shorter odds than Uncle for the Cup, but
the crowd in general seemed to be in favor of the
big fellow’s eliauce. This writer wasn't. Uncle Sam s
way of coming with a late run is not the old way,
and, to the writer’s mind, the mare is better worth
backing. Still she can’t be made out to have a rcd-
liot chance. The field was weak last year when she
failed to beat Aurifer, and even though the same
two were certain to run first and second again, the
friends of the Sydney horse would expect the order of
finishing to be as before.
Blaque’s victory in the Guineas gives him a show
on paper to win the Cup. He is only a small horse,
however, and his running hardly suggested that he is
brilliant enough to get away from the start and
avoid the bumping that is fatal to little ’uns, as a
rule, in the crowded Cup race. Rathlea s captuie of
the Toorak Handicap was more impressive. This
rather erratic galloper may fail to last out the 12
furlongs, but he is th° cut of animal to hold bis own
in a push and come with a rattle at the right end of
the journey.
* * * *
“O’Cork”: I rise to present a merely
Sydney view of the Caulfield Cup for what it may be
worth. Last vear Aurifer, with Bst. lib., won from
Anna Carlovna with 7st. 91b„ a difference of 61b.
Subsequently Aurifer won a Welter mile; but as
nothing else was seen or known of him he was let
into this year’s Caulfield Cup with Bst. 91b., a rise of
only 81b. oii his winning weight. And as Anna Car-
lovna has also gone up 81b. (to Bst. 31b.), there is
still only 61b. between them. Sons of Flavus improve
with age, and Aurifer, provided it is the Caulfield
and not the Melbourne Cup that is his mission, should
win again. The two South Australians, lownit (/st.
131 b.), winner of last Newmarket; and Greek Fire
(7st. 71b.), winner of the Moonee Valley Cup, dropped
in between last year's richly-gilded mugs, are both
likely to run forward. So are Garlin (6st. 91b.), Sir
Alwynton (Bst. 91b.), St. Carwyne (7st. lib.), Sylvan-
more (Bst. lib.), and Gladwya (6st. 131 b.). For
places; Aurifer (if wanted) 1. If he be held over
one way or another till Flemington, then lownit
should win next Saturday from Garlin and St.
Carwvne.

The A.J.C. Spring Meeting was a holiday
outing for owner E. .T. Watt. Ilis cheque for prize-
money ran to £7969. He won the Derby with
Mountain Knight, the Breeders’ Plate with Del Monte,
and the Kensington and High-Weight handicaps with
Tatterley. What he cleaned up Josephus McShort-
odds for, Heaven may know but will not tell.

“O’Cork” reminiscences: In all the dreary
waste of time between 1890 and 1914 only five
Epsom (Sydney) first favorites have won, and Royal
Laddie was the 16th to run, unplaced. The last
Epsom favorite to win was Famous, in 1902. The
Metrop. distance was, in 1892, reduced from two
miles to one and a half, and in 23 years only four
first favorites have got home, and one moke that
shared first favoritism witli another. Fifteen chosen
nags were unplaced. How eagerly O’Flahertv McPales-
tine must wait for his annual beanfeast at Randwick!
* * * *
For the last day of the A.J.C. Spring
meeting the weather was bleak and showery and
altogether unpleasant. The gilded plum of the aftei-
noon was the Randwick Plate, a two-mile jig worth
£2OOO added money. Only six started. The public
came at. Cagou so strongly the pencillers asked tor
odds-on, but the brute is generally understood to
have gone out an even-money favorite. Scared by
the price, many turned their attention to Inly veil
and Ulva’s Isle, and backed them down to tours.
Danaus was the outsider, and he and Cagou ran what
looked like a dead heat for last place. Ulva s Isle
was last to get away, and drove all the others before
him till he reached the straight for the first time.
There he closed up somewhat, but still hung defiantly
on at the tail of the show till he came once more
to the straight, where he slipped along a little in a
quiet, well-bred, unobtrusive way. At the distance
lie just slipped quietly to the front without any
apparent effort, and beat Posinatus by a length and
a half, and Lilyveil by four and a half. It was a
sweet thing.
A glance over the synopsis of the A.J.C.
Spring Meeting reveals the fact that when the
bookmaker takes any visible risks he makes the
punter pay a stiff price for it. Of the 24 race-
winners three were odds-on favorites (the Hurdle,
Trial Stakes and Craven Plate), the prices being
six to four, five to four, and 11 to eight. Sport ot
Kings! In the Clibborn Stakes Carlin was backed
down to five to two against, and in the Gimcrack
Stakes Starland went out at seven to two against.
In only nine races were double figures laid against
winning horses, and two of them were 33 to one a
sure indication the public was not looking at either
of those prads.

Edwin Miles, one of the very oldest of
y.K.C. identities, passed out last week. He was clerk
of the scales at Flemington in the 60’s of last century,
and for 40 vears the burly, short-necked clerk had the
last say in' the Melbourne Cup result. He said all
right” when the winning jockey had weighed in. He
belonged to the old-fashioned school of sports who
tried to conceal a kindly disposition under a gruff
manner.

Passed over, at Christchurch, Harry Piper,
for 20 years starter for the Canterbury (M.L.)
Jockey Club, and one of the best-known men con-
nected with the sport of kings and spielers in Loan
Land. He set the nags going for 17 racing clubs,
and General Satisfaction was an ally of his till the
dead finish.
Yale Lock, who has shown his heels to
some purpose in the Golden West, recently joined the
angel band. In about 250 races in which he started
he was placed first 46 times, second 49 and third 39
(imes —l34 places in 250 starts. He owed his owner
nothing for his oats.
* * * *
To be disqualified because he carried loz.
above the allowed “over weight” is a nice reward for
a Maribyrnong Trial Stakes winner—or any winner,
for that matter. On October 3 Pretty Bobby lost a
valuable race for infringing the V.R.C. rule. The
weighing-out stewards allowed the jockey to take his
mount to the barrier with Bst. 21b. (21b. allowed over-
weight), and the weighing-in stewards disqualified him
for winning with Bst. 21b. loz. The riding gear could
have absorbed the extra ounce of sweat from the
geegee, but the rule doesn’t recognise horse-perspira-
tion.

The second round of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket commenced on Saturday on wickets that had
been badly soaked by morning showers. Conse-
quently scoring was far from brilliant, the best
tally being the 316 of Central Cumberland against
Middle Harbor, due mostly to Pye and Sid Thomas,
who made 91 and 80 respectively. Next was the
269 of Gordon at the expense of Paddington—Gee
with 79, Boyce 41 and Macartney 31. Glebe notched
217 off Balmain, who then promritlv threw away four
wickets for 14 runs. Western Suburbs, dismissed by Red-
fern for 165, got two Redfern wickets for 38. Sydney
put Petersham out for 153, and then made a miserable
54 for five wickets. North Svdr.ov made a wretched
start against Univer~''tv. scoring 144 and wetting
only four Uni. wickets for 93. In bowling, Rough,
of Middle Harbor, was the lion, with six for 106.
Mailer, of Redfern, bagged four for 68; Coffey, of
Si dnev, three for 16: Adams, of Redfern. three fm-
-22; and Stack, of University, three for 30. Alto-
gether, a dreary day.

Melbourne’s pennant cricket finished its
first round on Saturday. Last season’s premiers, St.
Kilda, having made 288 for nine wickets, sent ’Roy
to the wickets, and put them out twice in a hurry
for 61 and 51. North polished off P’ran for 114,
chiefly through the deadliness of newly-discovered
left-hand trundler Lear, who got six for 29. North’s
turn yielded 141, which gave it a two-pomt victory
and no more. Carlton's slackness between wickets
lost it three good men “run out,” so it could com-
pile but 193, which the Students more than matched
with 271 for three wickets.”, Collingwood’s bowlers
did poorly against Souths, who ran up 230; then
’Wood slapped up 240 for nine wickets. Richmond
had a high old time on East’s-ground, knocking up
321 ; then East had, its little say and had made 302
for four wickets when the umpires left the game a
draw. Melbourne, competing ip, pennant cricket for

been decided to hold tlie M.L. Road Race over the
ancient battleground between Christchurch and

Motor racing is about to be exploited for
the first time in Melbourne on proper lines —as far as
tracks are concerned. A “syndicate” whispered in the
ear of the amateurs who run the Sports Ground
beside the Yarra, and tilings are going to happen in
consequence. A first-class track for motor-racing
will take the outer circle, and will be surrounded
with comfortable seating accommodation —“all in
the interests of sport,” says the syndicate. However,
the writer would guess that the real thing in view is
the Beachey-r urn-Barney Oldfield show. Beachey
juggles an aeroplane with ease. Oldfield is a hair-
raising motor-driver. The pair put up a sensational
race over a given distance, Beachey taking the air
track, so to speak, while Oldfield sprints under-
neath. The pair are drawing tremendous crowds in
U.S.A., and R. L. Baker, of the Stadium, has booked
(he sensation for Australia. Incidentally, John Wren,
on whom “Snowy?’ Baker can call in an emergency,
is said to have a finger in the Beachey-Oldfield show.
The motor project has quite caught the amateur
sporting bodies, as it is a sort of something-fov-
nothing affair. The whirligig of time brings strange
revenges. Some few years ago an amateur body
in Melbourne disdainful I v turned down a John Wren
proffered donation to a fund to send athletes away to
compete in the Old World. To-day the amateurs
welcome the idea of having a motor track laid do\\ n,
by an obviously professional _ syndicate, out for
big gate money, with highly-paid pros, as a draw, on
their own pot-hunting ground. The lion and the
lamb are about to sport together.

J. W. Cowan, a mere slip of a youth,
running in the East Melbourne Harriers colors,
defeated a field of 26 peds. in the 10-miles track
championship of Vic., at the Amateur Sports Ground
(Melb.), on Saturday. Cowan did most ot the
donkey work in the recent 10-miles cross-country
run, but was compelled to cry enough to Brown and
Allen over the last few miles. Last Saturday Brown
was the most noticeable absentee,' but Cowan would,
in any case, have been the winner that day. The
track was in excellent clip, and except for a bieeze,
which, for a while, hit the runners on the teeth, the
dav was conducive to good times. After four miles
(16 laps) had been traversed the wind fell and the
pace was very 1 ively, O’Neill (Carlton) being re-
sponsible for the pace. At six miles Cowan took
decided command ; Roy Allen cried a go, and quitted
the track. The winner lapped some of the. contestants
a couple of times, and pulled up at the 10th mile,
after a fine finish, without turning a hair. Ihe
time, 55min. 49sec.. is 30sec. outside the record made
bv E. A. Gore (Essendon Harriers) in 1912. W.
Murray (Melbourne), winner in 1911, finished a
couple of hundred yards behind Cowan, after an
excellent recovery. Carlton Harriers gained the day
in the teams championship with Manley, O Neill and
Worsr.op in third, fourth and fifth positions. Some
10 peds finished inside 58min. 19sec.—very fair run-

Australian-rules football has closed for the
season with the usual struggle for club premiership of
the Commonwealth between the premiers of Adelaide
and Melbourne. Port Adelaide played Carlton on the
Adelaide Oval, and won comfortably—nine goals 16
behind® to five goals six behinds —though not so
easily as last year. The result was fairly
consistent with form, taking the only possible
“line” through this season’s inter-State carnival.
Victoria won that, but S.A. was a good second ; and
of the Vie. clubs Carlton is best only by a trifle
while in Adelaide the unbeaten Ports stand clean
out away from anything else. This mate
very rough ; and the Adelaide men, who are used to
seeing anything like roughness absolutely squashed by
the umpire, showed a tendency to hit out wne
bumped. # *
Having been definitely biffed out of auia-

In spite of the dullness of Saturday after-
noon in Sydney, the Harbor was white with sails tie
Plying Squadron running off the first handicap
season in two heats and a final. The crews; we e in
great form, and some of the seamanship was about
as perfect as anything can be in this battle-searrfe ,
sinful world. In the first heat the whole 11 who
were in it started at a bound, with bailooners flashing
like silver against the grey water. Oil Biadley s Head
the steamer lndarra scattered the fleet and spoilt a
good race for the time being. Out of the ruck and
confusion the 11. C. Press got ahead of Desdmona, and
stayed there, and the wife of Othello beat Mona for
second place. The Second heat brought 10 starteis,
and tlie long-markers got away with such a fast and
sustained rush that they led the squadron right to
Taylor Bay. Then Sydney, Boroma and lvismet com-
menced to slip through the water at a faster pace.
Sydney led the way round Shark Island, with Boio-
nia’s bumpkin over her stern, so to speak, and in the
final rush the boat with the fragrant name heat Syd-
ney for first place, with Arline third. Then came the
tussle between the best of the two heats. The wind-
eaters revelled in a freshening breeze, and seven ot
them rounded the mark with only a minute between
the first and the last. On the way to Clark Island
Kismet let fly a ring tail. But it was no good, Bes-
demona and Sydney, catching more breeze througfi
being farther from the lee of Point Piper, swept easily
past even Kate itself, and they finished in that order.
A good race and a' fine sight.

When Volaire, of France, and McCoy, of
Australia, weighed at three o’clock on Saturday after-
noon, Volaire went 9st. 9jlb. and McCoy 9st. (ilb.;
so they were as near as hang it. The only fly in the
ointment was that Volaire had injured liis right
“duke” in some way, and was afraid to let it loose.
But as the audience did not know that it did not feel
the loss. When it does see that right hand let loose
it may feel sore over wliat it missed—but not till
then. McCoy was distinctively aggressive, and went
in to swap punches vigorously. The Frenchman, be-
■ sides his very charming and effective foot-work, has a
very pretty left hook, and got in a series of beau-
tiful ones that made McCoy’s guns rattle badly. Had
they been followed up with good right-hand work,
McCoy would have had the worst of it. But they were
not. * Volaire’s right-handed work was only half-
hearted.
Both parties put up some very pretty glove work
ill the fourth, in which McCoy tried to develop a
guard for the hooks while he swung his own divine
left where it might do some mischief. In the fifth
they fenced a lot for openings. By the sixth it was
evident to McCoy that he was- up against a better
boxer but an inferior fighter, so he went in to make it
a raw-meat affair. And then he struck more trouble,
for the gallant Gaul ducked superbly. Still, McCoy
Scored points. In the eighth Volaire’s footwork was
coruscating, and in the ninth he startled the Austra-
lian with a series of deadly uppercuts that made the
latter distinctly respectful. McCoy, though apparently
slightly ahead on points owing to his vigorous attack,
was worried. He didn’t know what to do with tins
curious Gallic proposition, with the result that in the
lOtli there was a very wild rally in which both cut
loose. The Frenchman ignored the pain of his injured
mauley, and biffed and smote with both hands impar-
tially. Filled with the idea that Frenchmen cannot
stand punishment McCoy continued to shower in blows,
regardless of what he was getting himself during the
11th and 12th. In the latter session Volaire re-
bounded off the ropes and met McCoy with something
in the midriff that hurt horribly and sent him stag-
gering., But lie recovered with marvellous quickness,:
am! .defended himself by hitting like thunder and
seven fiends.
Then Volaire began to husband his strength for a
hurricane finish, while McCoy went berserk. In the
16th he crowded in on top of the retreating French-
man and sent him to the boards with a crash, \olaire.
complained that he had been fouled, but referee
Harold Baker commenced to count, and the French-
man started to rise. Instead of walking away likg
Hughie Mehegan does .and coming back when his
rival is shaping up and properly on his feet, McCoy
stood there waiting for Volaire to rise. He ex-
pected the Frenchman to spring up. The Frenchman,
didn’t. He rose slowly, like a man who has a bone
in his leg. And he was about half-way up when
McCoy sprang in, and —woush! Before he. could
repeat it Mr. Baker pushed him off, and placing his
hand on Volaire’s head awarded him the victory and
the spoils thereof. Then Volaire removed his trunks
in the face of all Israel and also the Gentiles, and
showed that the boxer’s shield he wore was badly
dented. The result was that Herbert McCoy received
a decidedly hostile demonstration. He lost his popu-
lari tv in one wallop, so to speak. But it has to be
remembered that no one but a fool, when he is
winning on points, would deliberately foul an
opponent, whatever he might do if he were losing.
And, gentlemen, this writer submits that Herbert
McCoy is anything but a fool.

The
“Lincoln-Stuart”
Summer
“Suit-Special,”
63-
The “Lincoln-Stuart” Summer Special
is a Suit in keeping with the times. It
is something right out of the ordinary—
it represents a standard of value that is,
to put it mildly, exceptional—-it really
and truly stands
SUPREME AT THE PRICE.
The Tailoring will be well up to the
Lincoln-Stuart high standard—which is
good enough to suit any man —but THE
feature of the offer is the
MAGNIFICENT RANGE OF
SUITINGS
it includes. Every conceivable variation
of the exclusive Stripe and neat Check
designs is represented in beautiful shades
of Grey and Brown, and there is not an
inch of Stuff in the whole range that is
not of certified quality.
WRITE FOR PATTERNS.
A full range with Self-Measurement
korms, Tapes, etc., together with a copy
of our Catalog, will be sent you Post
k ree by return.
The special Suitings are worth far more
to the wearer than the price we are ask-
ing, and we cannot extend the offer in-
definitely, so write at once. Remember,
we make to a 6-Day Schedule. We pay
Freight, and we Guarantee Satisfaction.

According to Don Kirkham. just returned
SR , Franc ®> Befeium ancl Italy, our ideas of road
lacing require considerable modification. We have
gone ratty on high gears. In ancient Europe their
all-round racing gear is 69in. But they always tram
on 66m. When the Australian takes to road racing
he always insists that the minimum gear shall be
fs thk a witHh °l th n em ride with The trouble
is that with the higher gear one develops a sort of
piston-like stroke with the leg, and the human leg
does not reciprocate like a piston. So with the lower
„eai the French and Belgian cracks have developed
a superb ankle action that enables them on a 69in
gear, to finish faster at the encl of a long, gruelling
race—and, of course, it is easier right through the
run. Apparently the power required to drive the
higher gear brings into play muscular action that
inakes a good ankle action impossible.

One result of the war (the thing cannot
be evaded) is to heal the great breach
between the British police and the motorist. “Traps”
and charges of noise, smell and other things have
been forgotten, and the motorist and the police
omcer drink together at the same bar openly and
without shame. There is not a trap on a road now
in Britain—but, on the other hand, there is hardly
a car, except a military one.

of them occurred recently in Yankeeland, when a

just fit between the inside rims of his car’s wheels
l- n-ed wfih this discovery he had the car lifted on to
it. let her go, and drove for a mile. In some places
the grade was one in 10, a lovely prospect when the

A MARCHING SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Dedicated in sympathy to the officers and men of the
First Australian Horse Marines .)
-the Original intention to remove the Ist Infantry
Brigade from Kensington to Liverpool (N.S.W.) has
been abandoned, and the troops will remain where
f Wednesday the course will be required
tor the big- Spring Cup meeting, and for that day
the infantry will leave the grounds and - probably
engage in a march during the progress of the meet-
ing. Whatever inconvenience may attend such a
course, it has the advantage of making the men
accustomed to breaking and re-pitching camp.

Left, right, left! We’ve a weary way to go!

Query : “ How did you
first come to use Pebeco
Tooth Paste?”
Answer: “My whole
family, you mean. It’s this
way! Upon leaving the
dentist after a recent call,
he was insistent that 1 use
Pebeco Tooth Paste—said
it was the scientific prepara-
tion of a celebrated German
Chemist—that there really
was no dentifrice quite like
it because it hygienically
revitalized the entire oral
cavity and prevented ‘Acid-
Mouth’ —the cause of 95
per cent, of all tooth decay.
TOOTH PASTE
“ I followed his instructions .and found
the Dentist was right. Pebeco Tooth
Paste does purify and refresh the
mouth. Pebeco Tooth Paste does
stop ‘Acid-Mouth.

When the Bubble burst in the early ’oo’s the
Federal Palace Co. burst, too. The co. had
been formed on top of the boom, and capital
was in 130,075 shares of IDs. The dry-pub pro-
perty and furniture were in those tizzy days
reckoned to be worth £1d1,083 and £21),—10
respectively. But when the effervescence
stopped and the froth was blown off, the, co.
had a horrible feeling that its property wasn t
worth anything like what had been paid tor
it. In fact, it decided that £05.000 would
easily cover the lot; and to make tilings more
uncomfortable there was a mortgage. of
£OB.OOO. The only .-thing to do was to write
down the property (the mortgage unfortu-
nately couldn't be written down), ami £80,083
- came off the building item, and £17.800 off
the furniture. To even matters, the IDs.
shares were attacked on both flanks and in
the centre, and were so badly cut up that
only 2s. per share was left. Then reinforce-
ments of a further 1-kl. per share were called
up: but the former disaster had so depressed
shareholders that a number of shares wore
forfeited. Now the paid capital stands at
~nlv £18,4!>3 (2s. l*d. on 127.211 shares and
Bs. on 270). Calculated on that amount the
dividend looks very corpulent: but on the
original capital it is more like o p.c. than 22
P.c. .....
This is how the mortgage and other debts
have moved of late :

Liquid assets .. * 2,752 3,955 4,825
Deficit ..£57,180 £35,949 £35,438
The mortgage has stood still at £28,500 dur-
ing recent years. In the past 12 months it
was transferred from the Savings Bank, and
now it stands at £38,882 plus £037 of accrued
interest. Although this item hasn’t shown
the decrease The Bulletin would like to
see, the general position has improved con-
siderably. The nominally-big dividend leaves
a tine margin over for reserves, and this will
now be a consolation to shareholders, for the
current year looks as though it won’t fatten
the big residential pubs. Nevertheless Aus-
tralia has a wonderful knack of recovering
quickly after a drought; and when the
present troubles have blown by, tlie
Federal Palace Co. should be among
the earliest to _ get back _ on to its
exceedingly good wicket. The job would cer-
tainly be a much lighter one if the co. had
made anything like a decent attack on its
mortgage, which calls for its interest just as
regularly in bad times as it does in good.

There are two classes of investing shares,
paid-ups and contributing. As to paid-ups,
so miglitv is compound interest that £35
17s. lOd. paid in now- will at the end of 21
years realise £lOO, plus accumulated bonuses
(payable when the share matures). For the
past year the bonus was 15s. per £lOO share ;
for 1013. 10s. In the case of subscribing
shares, 7s. Bd. per month will in 15 years be
worth £100; or after paying in £1 Ds. Bd.
monthly for five years the holder can draw
£^o0 —in both cases plus accumulated
bonuses. The borrowing “share” gives the
holder the use of money which is repayable
by instalments extending over anything from
one to 15 years : £lOO is thus repayable at
the rate of 17s. Gd. a month for 15 years, or
£1 2s. Sd. a month will wipe out the debt in
10 years. In other words, instead of paying
rent for life, and still not owning a house, you
pay rent for, say, 10 or 15 years, and then
own the house. It would do no one any harm if
various State Premiers could put in an hour
of two studying building-society methods
next time they decide that a Sinking Fund is
a too-expensive relative to have about the
place.
The high rents of late and the ease with
which higher wages have enabled building-
society terms to be complied with have meant
big advances. The following shows how this
society has fared

Though the total advances may seem very
big compared with the capital, the co. has
adopted the policy of putting by a big pro-
portion of the profits each year, and now has
quite a respectable reserve. Capital is thus
well protected. To date there have been no
properties thrown on the society’s hands, and
though there seems a big chance of building
societies in the mainland States soilipg then-
clean slates, less droughty Tasmania isn’t
likely to be so hard hit. though, of course,
the shrivelling-up of the lead, tin and copper
mining business isn’t going to do Launceston
any good.

and no notice taken of lode formations. In fact, in 1906, Mr.' Charles G. Gibson, Govt. Geologist,
sail i,hat the reef, as usual, is “bunchy,” varying in thickness to nearly two feet, the average being
. Oin. to 1.2 in. Ahe lenses vary, one being over 60 feet in length, and having an average thickness of
nearly two feet, but carry their size well vertically: they pitch slightly towards the south. - The
piesent owners, Messrs, Gaston and King, started sinking a new shaft on a lode formation consisting,
ot kaolin and ironstone with quartz leaders running vertically in the lode. After sinking to a depth
of 80 feet a crosscut was put in SO feet across the lode, which ranged from 3dwt. io 6dwt. per ton,
while the quartz leaders ran from 10 to 12 inches wide and assayed 5 to 10 ounces, Since October
last, 425 tons of bulked ore have been treated for a return of £7860, exclusive of gold in residues.
A Huntingdon mill pump, etc., to be operated by suction gas engine, have been ordered, and the ore
will in future be treated on the mine.”
Mr. Gibson, in bis report generally on the Burtville Auriferous Beit, writes as follow's (Bulletin No.
24, page 30 :
“It is within Die area of granitic rocks that most of the payable quartz reefs are found, and it is
in this respect that Burtville differs from most of the other known mining centres of Western
Australia.
“’I lie quartz reefs are almost invariably small, but they make up for this by often being of
exceptional richness; they are usually of clean white—sometimes blue—quartz, and generally vary
from 6 to 12 inches in thickness, often extending longitudinally, however, tor a considerable distance.
COMPARATIVE GOLD RETURNS.
The gold production of Western Australia to the end of 1913 totalled £114,880,573, being 51.22
per cent, of the total gold yield of the Commonwealth of Australia.
Hie gold production of New South Wales to the end of 1913 totalled £60,098,678, being
£54.781,895 less than that of Western Australia.
Gold yield of Western Australia for 1913, £5,581,701, an increase of £133,316 over the year 1912
Gold Yield of New South Wales for 1913, £635,703.
Pin- Burtville mining centre produced to the end of 1913, from 62,907 tons of ore, 100,107.14 fine
ounces of gold, valued at £425,990, being an average of 1.59 fine ounces per ton.
The “Golden Bell” exceeds the average by 70 per cent., being, as shown in the ore production
return, 2.80 tine ounces per ton. CONTR ACTS

him as a sane and indignant

PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
An Invaluable Guide to the
Art of Public Speaking.
NEVER before has there been such a demand for men who can
speak in public. Both political parties are keeping a keen look-
out for such speakers. Organisers of meetings of all sorts find
speakers their chief difficulty. And the man who can deliver an
effective speech has a great advantage over his competitors. For the
man who stutters and stammers and finally sits down after a speech
principally consisting of “urns'’ and “ers” scarcely enhances his repu-
tation as a keen-witted member of the community, or as a man whose
intelligence and resource can be depended upon in a business crisis.
Moreover, the man who is a practised speaker, is never at a loss
for a word, and he scores even in ordinary business interviews. He
presents his points in logical order, and gains his desires when the
ordinary man would fail.
tor that reason the “Book of Public Speaking'' is an event of the
greatest importance. For it is the first comprehensive work upon this
important subject ever published in this country. It provides at once
a collection of the greatest speeches of the world’s greatest orators,
and at the same time a reliable guide to the Art of Public Speaking.
A FREE BOOK.
The Publishers have prepared an interesting- illustrated book—which they will send
tree—describing the work and their offer to deliver the complete work as published tor a
m>t payment of 6s. only, the balance being- paid by small monthly payments.

The Inky Way.
“T.” : It lias been written of Charlie Bean,
who goes to the front as Commonwealth war
correspondent, that on joining S. M. Herald
he showed such aptitude for news-getting that
he was speedily transferred to another de-
partment. An extraordinary feature of Aus-
tralian presswork is that a first-class re-
porter is never allowed to remain a reporter.
If he by some rare dispensation of Provi-
dence is advanced in screw he is made a
sub-editor, cable man or leader writer. The
idea of giving a reporter £lO, £l2 or £l5 a
week never occurs to any paper. The only
way they advance him financially is to take
him off a job in which he more than earns
his screw and put him on to another, at
higher wages, in which he is often of infinitely
less value.
“J.F.11.” (London) : Some press mates of
mine had a very bad time in Berlin when the
news came that the British had declared war
upon the . Almighty Kaiser. They were
peremptorily fired out of hotels, banged on
the head with trays by waiters, violently
assaulted by infuriated crowds, and treated
with astounding brutality by police and de-
tectives under the pretence that they were
English spies. But for the intervention of
the American Ambassador, who warmly pro-
tested against these “fourteenth-century
methods,” some of the correspondents would
hardly have got out of Berlin with their lives.
As it was. they had to leave their personal
goods, and are never likely to see them again.
* * * *
“Penquill”: The Inky Way of Tasmania
is a rocky track at the best of times, and
screws in Hobart are a third lower than in
Melbourne and Sydney; but things can be
worse even than that. A Hobart paper
recently printed a libel on a candidate for
the Senate, who went after it with a writ,
and got judgment for £651 and costs, Next
the editor came out with the announcement
(in his own paper) that lie was going to
pay the costs of the action out of his salary.
Awestruck by this spectacle, one member of
the literary staff weighed in with a £5 note
and a letter to the editor telling him what a
fine fellow he was. The £5 was accepted
and the letter printed. Another dubbed up
a contribution, but the rest did not seem to
come at it very enthusiastically. However,
to give them a good show to display their
zeal, a meeting of the staff was called. The
boss was chairman, and the box with the
“Drop coins here” sign was well rattled.
All present resolved to separate themselves
from some of their hard-earned coin. No
doubt they felt it a privilege. A couple led
off with £3 apiece and the others followed
with divers amounts. Whether the one
payment ends it or whether there are to be
further instalments I don’t know yet. I'm
not making a row because the staff is help-
ing the owners when the latter strike a bit
of bad luck. I’m only putting the facts on
record to give the owners an excuse to reci-
procate when a bit of bad luck strikes any
of the staff.
# * * *
“Vic”: Mrs. Swords, of Dandenong. died
this week, aged 93. Her late husband was
Melbourne’s first shipping reporter. Arden
and Strode came from Sydney, and estab-
lished the Gazette in Melbourne, and
in 1840 they imported Swords from England.
Afterwards he founded the first Victorian
country paper, the Portland Guardian. By
1851 lie was comparatively rich, with landed
property in Bourke-street and Collingwood.
The gold rush ruined him. His tenants
bolted to the fields as one spieler, and mostly
omitted, in their haste, to pay up arrears
of rent. In any case, his investments were
rendered valueless. So he ivas sold up by
the money-lenders, and had to begin afresh.
In 1800 he established the Bacchus Marsh
Guardian, and in 1874 the Dandenong
Advertiser. And now he is dead. His
glory has departed, and likewise, as above-
mentioned, his nonagenarian widow.
“(Hie) .facet": The Repeal is (or was)
tlie official organ'of- the cranks who are (or,
rather, were) in favor of destroying the com-
pulsory clauses of the Maoriland Defence
Act. Before the war it declared that “for
14 months it had been a thorn in the side of
the military clique in Maoriland; for 14
months it had carried on an uncompromis-
ing attack upon the wretched Defence Act
and everything military.” It then asked its
readers for a trifling £2OO “to make the
defeat of the military party in Maoriland
crushing and decisive." assuring them that
"the Defence Act is tottering. A wave of
feeling is sweeping over the country against
it. and all it stands for. It is within the
power of the Repeal to bring about the
absolute overthrow of conscription, if our
readers will help us to do so." (Of course
there never was any conscription in Maori-
land, but that didn't matter. The word
looked good and large, like the rooster that
crowed at St. Peter.) Nowadays the
Repeal is a rather difficult publication to
find. Perhaps something has gone wrong
with it.
“0.C.0.”: I believe Bean, of the S. M.
Herald, was as good a man as Australia
could have sent to war-correspoud with the
Australian troops. But even if a man knows
all the languages of all the countries where
all the calamity is raging—even if he knows
Europe like a book, and is an expert motor-
ist. and is prepared to take his life in both
hands and both feet for 24 hours a day, and
is accustomed to the game, what does it
profit? He isn't allowed to correspond
worth 2d. All manner of hardy veterans
have tried to butt into (lie game, and have
simply been arrested and sent back. Our
rulers are still treating the business as a
picnic. If it lasts for a year they will
realise that this is not a time to scatter 12
bright sovereigns a week on frill.
* * * *
“Black and White”: It would cheer up
Germany considerably if some exiled Teuton
could send home samples of the libellous and
contemptible John Bulls now being drawn
by some of our most loyal artists. These
well-meaning fellows represent the honest,
bluff old English squire as a D —d Old Fool.
Sometimes lie is less of a Fool than a Blob.
In one unforgettable Sydney cartoon lie was
a blubbery and inebriated old lady, dressed
in sailor costume, whooping madly for some-
thing or other. The hard-working artist
evidently intended him to be a sort of Beres-
ford ; but the result of his patient toil was
the awful old lady aforesaid. Can't the
Pure Food Act be amended to meet this sort
of crime? Can’t John Bull be declared a
thistle under the Victorian law for the obli-
teration of noxious weeds?
* * * *
“J.L.F." : When I went on the Melbourne
press, in 1807, the first tiling I was sent to
do was the City Council, and the Akgtjs
man who sat beside me was Henry Gullett.
Ten minutes ago I got from “the much-
travelled” R. S. Smythe a photo, of Gullett
and himself, taken in 1905, by “Hop,” of
The Bulletin. R. S. Smythe and Henry
Gullett first met at Melbourne Yorick Club
in the early 70’s of last century, and after
that never lost track of one another. ■ They
wrote often: Smythe's last from “11. G..”
dated July 11 last, told of his acci-
dent. and talked about his “suffering in hav-
ing to assume the pitiful position of a
patient.”
* * * *
“Gus Gosh”: Bible-thumping and jour-
nalism are joint income-producers in
Australia, just as in England. As a rule,
the Rev. Penpusher doesn’t now do much
for the city press except in the way of
signed specials; but there was a time when
three Methodies used to flood one of the
Adelaide dailies with leaders and such-like,
and several reverend gents., chiefly Metho-
dists, still earn a few bob a week by doing
work for country rags. In one of tin l goldfields
towns in W.A. a young clergyman (Angli-
can in this case; actually looks after the
general news, reports meetings, etc. I don’t
think the reverend blacklegs are any more
to blame than the cheap-labor proprietors.
The average parson only has to hold his
weekly envelope up to the light and he can
see right through it, and in many eases he
has a hungry tribe waiting for him at home.
If only the various church authorities w r ould
curtail their foreign mission expenses, and
raise the screw's of their home soul-savors,
they’d be doing a good turn to a lot of
pressmen. Still, I suppose the needs
and comfort of the journalist at home
aren't worth tuppence compared with
a nigger's soul. “J.F.II.’s” remark (P>.
17/9/14) that many Methodist preach-
ers in England derive extra incomes
from purely commercial pursuits re-
minds me of one Presbyterian pulpiteer—-
it. was in S.A.' —who bought and sold stock
while travelling his circuit. Incidentally,
he owned the winner of a couple of hand!-'
caps in the Port Lincoln district. He once
sold me a prad afflicted with heart disease or
something—the thief! I had a lot of
trouble in getting rid of that horse at a
profit. I sold it to one of the elders of his
kirk.

“8.. T.”: Archie Strong, literary critic of
Melbourne Herald, has given London Times
some verses on the war. Archie's repent
volume of translations of Theodore Banville’s
ballades, which was favorably reviewed by
the high-toned London publications, has made
quite a reputation for him in the Cold Coun-
try. The Times containing Strong’s verses
is not yet to hand, but it is fairly safe to say
that they are better than those of Laureate
Bridges which the Thunderer recently
launched at its readers. Archie Strong, by
the way, is a son of Dr. Charles, of the
Australian Church.
RESTRRECTION, UNLIMITED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Von Emmich (who suicided), Von Buelow (who
was shot), Van Kluck (who surrendered with 20,000
men), are all, at latest reports, heading divisions
and fighting vigorously again.
Von Emmich cried in grim despair:
“1 really cannot mend it;
The Belgian devils dare to fight,
And beard the Teuton in his might—
I'll shoot myself for grief and spite,
My hand alone shall end it!”
Yet, strange to say,
He rides to-day
Among the foremost in the fray.
Von Buelow fell a month ago—•
A Belgian sniper spotted him;
Crept up, with corpses as a blind,
And shot the German from behind ;
Just when on vict’rv he had dined
The stripling neatly potted him.
let. strange to tell,
lie soon got well.
And fights where as a corpse he fell.
Van Kluck surrendered what a blow
For Prussian ways that stifie men!
The British took the Teuton's sword,
For joy the gazing Tommies roared,
The Gallic pennons gaily soared
Above the captive riflemen.
Yet now he goes
Upon his foes
With Sturm and Drang and doughty blows.
The Kaiser's youngsters (serve him right!)
This cursed conflict drew them in ;
In Brussels lately perished two;
One lost a leg (he got his due),
And all the rest have had to rue
The wicked war he threw them in.
Yet—runs the tale —
They now are hale,
And vow to twist the Lion’s tail!
Envoy.
The Prpss (explanatorily) :
“1 am the One who makes the fray,
The black defeat, the vict’ry gay ;
I kill the soldier on the plain.
I bring him back to life again ;
I am the Yivisectionist,
I am the Resurrectionist!” .

The Return of
Tulle to Fashion.
fl Tulle is so soft, so delicate, so
dainty, so feminine in its loveliness —it imparts
such youthful appearance io the wearer —that
nothing could stem the tide of its return to
popularity.
When buying Tulle do not be content merely
to ask for “Rainproof Tulle” —say “‘Dy-
namo’ Rainproof Tulle, please,” and look for
the name on the card on which the Tulle is wound.
•J This is important, because even a mist will
ǽ
ruin the most expensive ordinary
Tulle; but “Dynamo’’ is
Waterproof. When wet you
simply shake it until dry. It
immediately regains the appear-
ance it had when new.
“Dy namo” Rainproof Tulle does not stick
to the fingers when handled. Its fresh crispness,
its lustre and beauty of colouring are not
impaired by exposure to the strongest sunlight,
and it never becomes tender or limp.

CL All the best Milliners use “Dynamo” Rainproof
Tulle. All the best Stores sell it by the yard. ut

of the card on which the Tulle is wound. If any

we will see that you are immediately supplied.

Novel Method for
Waving' the Hair.
TOILET TALKS.
MANY a charming face is spoiled by
straight, lank, and excessively greasy
hair. Naturally curly hair gives a most
delightful effect even to a plain face, a fact
which has unfortunately been known for
many years. This knowledge alone has re-
sulted in the ruination of thousands of heads
of beautiful hair by slow torture from that
terrible instrument, the curling iron. Im-
agine, if you can, how the living hair squirms
and twists under such treatment. Yet this
is the very result you aim at. Well, I have
no doubt that each one individually is of Ihe
opinion that the results justify
the meas, but let me tell you
that the reckoning will have to
be paid, and in a manner which
will be far from pleasant. The
twists and curls created by the
hot iron are the hairs’ dying con-
tortions, and it is only a question
of time when you will have no
hair left to torture. If it is
absolutely necessary to have
wavy hair, then there is a far
more simple and harmless pro-
cess which any woman may
adopt without fear as to the
results. Get from your chemist
two ounces of silmerine, and
pour about two tablespoonfuls into a saucer.
With a clean toothbrush apply this to the
hair upon retiring. You will be quite
amazed at the result, and one application
will last for many days. Damp weather
need have no terrors for you if you take
these simple precautions, and straight, wispy
tails will be converted into tight little curls,
giving a charming and pretty effect, even to
a plain face.
Note. —Silmerine has not been used to any
extent for this purpose, but most chemists
keep a small supply in stock.
NOW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
to expect that one particular make will
suit everybody? Certainly not. Some
a
folks have dry and brittle hair, others have
tresses which are excessively greasy. Each
requires a different grade of shampoo, if one
is to obtain the best results. The writer’s
notice was recently brought to a substance
called stallax, which' can be obtained from
most chemists. It consists of small gran-
ules, which, when mixed with a cup of hot
water, make the most charming mixture
imaginable for shampooing the hair. Ac
cording to the quantity used, so the strength
is graduated to suit all conditions. There
is one drawback, however, and that is stallax
can only be obtained in jib. tins,
which cost about half a-crown,
but as this quantity is sufficient
to make 25 to 3U shampoos, it
is really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always be
avoided bv rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to its
application.
AFEn’ remarks on face
creams may not be out o f
pune. and at the risK of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned. my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not
clog the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin from
performing its proper functions. but
usually result in encouraging a growth
of hair on the face, and you know
very well what that means —disfigure
ment for the rest of your natural days.
If it is necessary to use an emollient at
all, get some mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply in the usual way.
This remarkable substance seems to absorb
the worn and weatherbeaten outer cuticle,
and- jn a few days’ time the new, healthy
skin underneath peeps forth _in all its
brilliance, and is, of course, quite free from
imperfection or blemish. [1

O-DAY, particular thought should be
given to one’s shoes. Definite purpose
and not caprice should rule their
choice, since Fashion recognises their dress
value and insists that they shall harmonise
with the rest of one’s attire. Thus, by
following the lead of Fashion, a very dis-
tinctive and pleasing note can be attained.
Bostoclcs are designed for wear with the
newest toilettes; they are exclusive in style
and the cream of imported shoes.
Special shipments have recently arrived
at the leading stores, and ladies should call
before the choicest stvles are sold.

Marseillaise,” or the stirring Belgian Anthem come floating down the breeze.
Do you not feel a thrill of admiration and enthusiasm for the brave men lighting
for the cause of Right and Liberty? Patriotic music means more to-day than
ever it did —it is the expression of NATIONAL FEELING, no longer a title
but a Cause. .

11. Smyth: You found an advertisement
re imported boots in this paper, and you state, with
lofty scorn, that: “L. s. d. plays its part even with
The Bulletin.” It does. This paper doesn’t live on
charitable subscriptions, like the Salvation Army.
' It has got to find money somewhere, so that it may
pay Randolph Bedford, and Rod. Quinn and “Kodak,”
and “Hermes,” and “Henry Horsecollar,” and “Solo-
mon . Malaprop,” arid “0.K.,” and “Frank Croson”
and a herd of other writers for advocating Australian
industry and denouncing the imported boots. Do you
think that a paper can’t be patriotic unless its con-
tributors sleep in the Domain or beside the Yarra,
and live on crusts found in the dust-box? H. Smyth
—you are an unreasonable ass! Did you ever know
a teetotal Treasurer who refused to collect the drink
revenue? Did you ever know a parson who refused
to take up a collection because there was reason to
suspect that every coin had, some time in its life,
passed through the hands of an infidel, or an
immoral person, or a beer-drinker? H. Smyth—you
are the last possibility in the way of an ass ! You
don’t even rise to the pomp of being a mule. . . .
M.: So far as we can discover, Captain Lamroek
was appointed Assistant Censor (4/7/’l4). Don’t
know where he censors, but presume you can find him
by inquiry at head office. We have never
met him....H.0.: If you stick to principles,
and not to parties, William Arthur Tren-
with has gone pretty straight. He couldn’t help his
party wobbling away from him. And he could no
more help the Argus approving of him than the
Twelve Apostles could avoid the enthusiastic support
of Pope Alexander Borgia. The N.S.W. State Labor
party got into office on a programme of which The
Bulletin cordially approved. It turned dog on
almost every item of the programme, but because it
still calls itself “Labor” it calls those who didn’t
turn dog with it “traitors.” These things • can’t be
helped. .. .Novice: We don’t want you to write in a
frock-coat and belltopper, but it is just as well to
wear trunks when you go surfing in the inkpot. .. .Bert
R.: That sort of verse won’t save the Empire....
G.F. (K.) : Hopeless from our point of view. .. .E.P.:
Poem is as perishable as the brief-lived flower....
Bellerive: We hang up your portrait with pleasure:—
YOUR HUMBLE
Of medium Height and grey-streaked hair,
A solemn brow from trouble and care,
A man who don’t wear his heart on his sleeve
Such is your humble poor Bellerive.
....Alick NcD.: Fit only for vaudeville patter....
D. McL. (M.L.): Poor, thin verse —almost as poor as
the Poet Laureate’s. . . .Mrs. C.R.8.: Usual coward-
hero story told in the conventional way J.P.D.:
We must hurry on. The next contribution we’ve got
to deal with is entitled. “The Great War.” Rejected
in haste F.J.R.: Of course, there’s booming and
clashing of steel! What sort of noises did you
expect to hear —the five-finger exercise and smacks?
... War Poets: It having been found impossible to
deal with martial contributions in detail, the follow-
ing war poets are hereby informed that their con-
tributions have fallen back in disorder, and been
surrounded by the basket: Light Horse, F.H.P.,
C.B:A., L.C., Yera J., A.T., Sorbie, M.E., A.M.8.,
Bel A., S.M., E.J.C., W.H.C., author of ‘The Song
of the’ Sword,” H.T., C.1.R., R. McL., Miranda,
J.C., William L., J.A.P., George G., E.A., C.W.G.,
Jay, Michael L., J.S.A.C., Barbed Wire, Timothee,
R.M. (Q.), Duncan C., S.J.W.K., John A., B. (in
indelible pencil, curse him !) And may the No !
it wouldn’t be a fair thing. . . .A.lf. : Yes, it was a
risk, right enough Farleigh Mill: Don’t remember
it. Try a music" house... .1.R.M.: A touch or flick
of pathos, but the thing’s too slight Gazeeka:
It’s an old and rancid smoking-room story. You
might as well try to sell us the Pyramids. .. .Bar-
barian: You’ll have to howl outside the cave a bit
longer.... Mrs. S.: Not very bright anecdotes....
R.M.V.: Unsuitable. Odds are the next batch will
be just as unsuitable. .. .J.M.K. (S.A.) : Yoit’re an
unbroken poet, but not a fresh one.... Posh: Your
note: “Am sending above stuff without apology to
anyone, but with the hope that, if basketed, it is
given its quietus without venom.” No venom neces-
sary. It perished without assistance E.J.0.: As
a kiss-writer you’re a failure. Apprentice yourself to
some eminent bosom-and-hair specialist. .. .E.L.L.:
Tired of that acting poem.... Mario: Had to sacrifice
your verses in order to blow up a barrel-organist.
Used the verses to light the fuse E.J.H.: “The
Ballad of the Spectre” is too terrible for print
Warradulla: No T.A.L.: This office hates a poet
who (1) “methinks” all over the place; (2) refers
to the moon as Luna: (3) asks questions such as
“Whence comes the secret of thy birth?”; (4) wants
to space out columns with index finger thoughtfully
pressing his pallid brow. You have all the above
defects C.V.C.: Exhibit A—“ From out her hair
she weaves a net.” Exhibit B —“ And on her breast the
salve divine drink in with passion’s ecstasy.”
Analyst’s Report —Bosom and Hair, Class IV.
Grade 5 A.K.: It’s a plain, bare, creaky bit of
poetic machinery. .. .R.S.V.: Thin. . . .Doc: Have read
your poems and decided to let you prescribe for
yourself E..T.IL : You are full of good Springtime
intentions. .. .Mourilli: It’s an unobjectionable poem
and escapes notice, like the plain girl in the corner
at a musical evening.... Thomas U.: Poem reminds
us of an old, crushed bag of chocolate creams....
John M.: “On through the trackless seas goes the
ship,” and on through the trackless basket goes the
screed Adam G. S.: Spring out, Spring bard
Lex (8.H.) : So you would write a war-poem, would
you? Don’t. You might spoil the war Y.:
Afraid not E.F.L.: You’ve got the two-volume
habit badly. . . .E.E.S.: It might be classed as rhymed
stodge. .. .N.G.M.: “In the Temple” not for print.
J.D.R.: Her treaty obligations didn’t require her
to do anything of the kind. Why don’t you look up
facts instead of rushihg to the front with bogus
information?. ~ .Beatribh Buchanan: Thanks, but
can’t reprint. .. .O’Macsbn: Possibly that nation will
be an ally, which brings your views under the guillo-
tine. .. .A.8.W.: What are the names of the papers?
.. . .Laborite: Far too long and wordy. Anyhow,
the point has been repeatedly made in The Bulletin.
.... Wallerawang: Send us the marrow; keep the
bones to rattle in some paper which hasn’t to go
right round a continent once a week.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J. J. Hudson: Four very poor suggestions for pic-
tures about the Kaiser. Will you kindly sit down,
grid lean your fevered brow against an ice-cream, and
consider that almost every illustrated paper on earth
is HOW getting 100 suggestions per week for pictures
about the Kaiser, in addition to those supplied by
its own artists and literary staff? Then lean your
fevered brow against another ice-cream.

If this should meet the eyes of the heirs of
one Tar Bucket, South Sea Islander, who
returned to the New Hebrides away back in
the ’7o’s, it will interest them to know that
£lO. is how awaiting. them in the Queens-
land Savings Bank. Most kanakas of 40-
odd years ago bought a trade-gun and a few
slugs and went home and laid out the next
blackbirder. Tar Bucket probably did so,
too; but he left a few shillings behind him
in the Savings Bank, and now the Queens-
land Treasury is profiting by his foresight —
or is it oversight?
“Wyangarie”: The best money made cane-
cutting is a matter of eternal argument in
sugar centres, from Mossman to Harwood.
Disputants frequently cloud the issue by
accepting the “biggest cheque” for a season
as final. This is an entirely wrong basis,
as some gangs cut out in five months, others
six, while there are instances of some
running over seven months. These varying
terms are known amongst sugar-workers as
seasons. In this writer’s experience the
biggest cheque for a season of any length
is £ll5 clear of tucker, averaged by W.
Maher’s gang on the Mulgrave, closely fol-
lowed by £ll2 clear to the credit of F. Toy’s
gang on the Clarence (N.S.W.). Both these
lots cut out in about six months. Much
better money, on a time basis, than either of
the above is the record of ,T. Johnson’s gang
on the Mossman (N.Q.), with £lO5 clear
after 44 months. The Mulgrave sugar-field
is the most consistent for uniformly good
cheques. In one season in that small centre
four gangs went over the century, with many
others close up. Here also the above-men-
tioned Maher’s gang made considerably over
the century three seasons running—a record.
Both Mulgrave and Mossman cane-cutting
cheques make the ancient gag about white
men being unable to work in the tropics look
gloomy.
A TIMELY HINT.
COUNTRY M AGAZINE: “Money talks, my man."
THE BEERLESS ONE (insinuatingly): “Yairs; but it's a pity it don't shout."
Henry M. Chester, who died lately at’
Brisbane, aged 82, put in a long spell as,
Police Magistrate and Goldfields Warden in?
North Queensland, a circumstance which per-
mitted the local wit to christen, him “Mar-
mion’s Last Word” —in allusion to Scott’s
hackneyed “Charge, Chester, charge.” It
wasn’t the last word, for Mar mi on
added “On, Stanley, on!” But the
idea was good enough to pass. He
gets his permanent niche in Australian
history from the fact that, in 1883, he gave
effect to Premier Mcllwraith’s order for the
annexation of all Papua which wasn’t Dutch
by hoisting the British flag in that land of
stewed missionary. The refusal of the Bull
Government to ratify Mcllwraith’s move led
to a lot of bother —including the recent
bother the Australian troops had of explain-
ing to Kaiser Bill’s local representative that
That Bit of the Earth Belongs to Us.
Months ago Premier Denham announced
that he had made satisfactory arrangements
for meeting next year’s big maturing loans.
Where are those “arrangements” now? When
Britain has taken all it needs for the upkeep
of the navy and nearly half a million of
men in the field, loan money will be about
as scarce as smiles under the moustache of
Kaiser William. What seems most likely at
present is that Denham will simply have to
say that the loans are renewed indefinitely,
and shut down on further argument.
Brisbane Telegraph has discovered that
the Fisher Government, composed of Social-
ists, communists, unificationists, anarchists
and several other alarming things, intends to
get at the State Governments to the extent
o f £250,000. Bananaland’s weird evening
journal beats the alarm drum in this fashion:
The first Australian Expeditionary Force comprises
100,000 men. They represent an annual income to
the States amounting to £125,000. A second 100,000
are to be sent to the front. They will represent
another £125,000; and therefore, on the year, the
Commonwealth Treasury will benefit to the extent
of £250,000. That should go some way to cover
falling off in customs revenue. But the States will
be “standing Sam.”
The fact that the two Expeditionary Forces
will comprise, not 200,000, but about 30,000
men, and that the expense of the Euro-
pean outfit will not be £250,000 but
£2,500,000, does not trouble the Telegraph
when it sets out to belabor a democratic
administration. The Telegraph represents
quite cheerily that you can get an expedi-
tionary army for 255. per man per annum.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thank J-leaven for this small key !
When the smith made it, did he ever guess
How it would loose the locks of Happiness,
And what eternal comfort it would be
To turn upon the world this little key?
Deep in some goblin-haunted under-cave
The iron that is its substance greyly ran ;
This metal to my freeing old Earth gave,
And for the forging yielded up to man ;
Above it, glowing red or cooling black
(Here a quick striking, there an artful
twist),
Helped at its birth some muscle-knotted back,
Shaped it to use some brown and hairy
wrist!
Only a little room that is my own !
An open window facing to the west,
A window plant that climbs and curls alone,
A chair, some pictures and a carven chest.
Here I am all myself! Slip down the
mask!
Stretch Wide my arms and laugh trium-
phantly,
While pixie fingers guide me to my task,
And all my faery friends make mirth with
me!
Keep out the drab-skinned, bloodless Com-
monplace—-
The coarse thumb on the fabric of a soul,
The avaricious eye, the peering face;
Give to. the revellers of the road control.
For in the dusk if one is very still
The magic player , tunes, his mandolin,
And dulcet echoes from some herb-sweet hill
Mixed with the pulse of stars come floating
in !
How sure the music throbs, how bravely
blent!
It leaps the street, it riots in the room,
That gentle trilling was an almond scent,
For elves are reading notes upon the bloom.
And flowers are to them as signs to us;
Even the south wind spells it, blossom
told—
In violets finds a minor susurrus,
And thunders major to the dahlia’s gold !
No claim of those unloved can hurt me here.
Age grumbles in the passage, shut away;.
If Sorrow smudge across the latch her tear. .
“Go to!” I cry, “and call another day !”
Here I expand and put my armor by;
See in what rainbow hues my soul I dress,
Knowing beyond the door—and patiently—
Waits in the world of man my loneliness!
Thank Heaven for this small key!
When the smith made it, did he ever guess
How it would loose the bonds of Happiness,
And what eternal comfort it would be
To turn upon the world this little key?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 10, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii, —
This has been a dull week in every way.
One or two scattered tea fights, a few con-
certs, and —the oasis in a drab Sahara the
Gilbert and Sullivan season. Even it had
its drawbacks, for, at the first performance
of “lolanthe,” Edward McKeown sprained
his ankle (lie is practically the only dancer
in the co.), and Frank Wilson developed a
bad cold, which compelled him to leave his
part to an understudy. I don t know the
understudy’s name, but he sang well. Last
night "The Pirates' of Penzance delighted
a crowded house, and “Pinafore” drew two
good audiences to-day.
The Arthur Morgans, who are doing odd
jobs for George V. just now, had a busy
time to-day. First they opened a “coin tea
affair at R. J. Morris’s house at Led Hill,
all the coin to go towards building a new
rectory for St. Barnabas’s Church. Then
they shed the rays of their p^sm lo6 at the
Exhibition, where a motor gymkhana,
organised by the Automobile Club, was
gathering in shekels for the Patriotic Fund.
The Mayor and his gentle little Mayoress
were working for the good cause at this
show, and the already bulging fund will
bulge Considerably more on the afternoon’s
takings.
Mrs. 11. J. Oxley has been made president
of the Children’s Hospital. 81ie is a sister
of Chief Justice Griffith. Miss Griffith, Lady
of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jeru-
salem, is another sister. For 24 years Mrs.
Oxley has worked on the; committee of the
Children’s Hospital, and she has been a vice-
president fob 18 years.
Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Muir, who are in
Scotland, have decided to settle down there
until after the war. They have taken a
house at Stirling, and will jaunt round to
inspect the haggis per motor. Mr. and Mrs.
Andre ,v Menzies, who are also in bonny
Scotland, will make a dash for sunny Aus-
tralia somewhere about next June.
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Hooper and Mr. and
Mrs. H. A. C. Douglas are spending some
weeks in Melbourne. Both the Mrs.’s are
daughters of T. C. Beirne, and belong to the
attractive, well-dressed corps of junior
matrons.
Dr. and Mrs. Moni were summering in the
Austrian Alps when war broke out. They
were still there when last heard of, and re-
ported all safe.. The doctor was for years
medical officer of Chillagoe Hospital. She is
the daughter of D. Swiss Davies, of George-
town. The Monis travelled by the trans-
Siberian route, and after spending some time
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Warsaw and
Vienna, left the last-named place two days
before the assassination of Ferdinand D’Este,
which caused Wilhelm such unholy joy.
Isabel Roberts, lady editor of the Daily
Mail, will discard presswork for matrimony
early in November. Her accomplice is “Jack”
McDaniell, manager of the Jarrah Timber
Co. The lady is,.-extremely popular with
her own sex, and the number of farewell tea
parties before the fatal day seems likely to
knock the bottom out of the provision
market. Corinth -Gailey is leading the way
with a linen tea next Friday.
The Coldham family are in town at pre-
sent on their way to Sydney, where Connie
Coldham is to be married to Roy Chisholm
on Wednesday next. Indeed, by the time this
is in print they two will be one. bar accidents.
They are a youthful pair, the bride being
about 19, and the ’groom barely 22. The
Ooldhams own Lammermoor station, and the
Chisholm brothers also land-squat for a
living.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Sundry Queenslanders are busy trying to
expel German names from their local geo-
graphy. German Creek and German Sta-
tion, along with Kaiser-street (North Bris-
bane), are marked out for slaughter. It is
a terrible vengeance.
“Syrup”: "Alrich” (B. 1/10/T4) says
the cane grub is a curse in the Cairns-Aini-
gra ve district. It is a curse in every sugar
district. Bundaberg seems to have hit on
the best means of destroying the fat, creamy
worm. Every ploughing party there takes
with it a travelling hen-house, and the ebooks
don’t need much training to follow the
plough, which turns the grubs up in hun-
dreds, and the number that an average-sized
hen gets through in a day is astonishing.
It’s the only way I know to make hen-keep-
ing profitable. There is no outlay for food
except what the grubs provide; and, war
having been declared against them, they can’t
recover.
“Splinter”: What standards are tie
authorities using when the backblccks Aus-
tralian comes up to volunteer for service at
the front? I know for certain that some
fellows from the North Lave been turoed
down because they couldn’t stretch the tape
far enough when it was passed around their
bosoms; yet those same fellows, after empty-
ing their curse-magazines, will go back to
their bush jobs and do work which the aver-
age town-bred nugget couldn’t look at. The
North does make a difference. It breeds men
who are mostly steel wire—fellows who can
stand rough saddle-worlc or bike-pushing all
day without turning a hair. And among
these chaps, who know what they can do,
there is bitter disappointment because a
standard which altogether disregards North-
ern conditions and products rules them out.
Bananaland’s police report, which inci-
dentally shows an increase of drunks to the
number of 644 for the year, makes a feature
of the horse-breeding station at Rewar.
Although on a comparatively small scale
this remount scheme has risen above
expectations as a financial success. The
stock at present comprises live breeding stal-
lions, six young stallions, 194 breeding mares,
45 geldings for allotment, and 318 three-
year-olds and under, while 925 are in use by
the police force. The strain is steadily being
improved, and already is of a highly respect-
able character. In fact, the Queensland -T.
Hop would use language that would earn
him a £5 fine if he were offered as a mount
some of the crocks used for military pur-
poses. But, then, for breeding military
mounts the Commonwealth hasn’t got a
station where the stock is carefully selected ;
and that makes all the difference.
Bananaland has been waiting for several
months for its returned Prickly Pear Com-
mission to uncork its views; but it transpires
that each member holds different views from
the other fellow, and the prospects of a
unanimous uncorking are nil or •(). The one
thing they all seem to agree on is that the
prickly fruit is Satan’s own proposition, and
it was hardly worth sending a Commission
round the earth to find that out. Any cocky
in the pear country would have staked his
life on it. He would even have staked his
best cow’s life ; and no cocky can do more
than that.
Miles McNaught, one of the oldest native-
born printers, went out of business the other
day. He was with the Age when Ebenezer
Syme was king, and was boss machinist in
David’s time for 32 years. That brought
him up to 1888, when he went to Melb.
Herald. He is 70, threatens to live till 90,
and believes that the linotype has badly
affected the craft of the printer, just as the
many bootmaking machines have made the
craft of the bootmaker almost extinct.

the front to chronicle the doings of the Aus-
tralian Imperial Force, ought to be a good
man for the job, though it is practically an
ornamental one. He has made a close study
of military matters, is possessed of a force-
ful, vigorous literary style, and, although a
native-born, spent his boyhood in Belgium.
Also, he can speak French and German and
Oxford English, if necessary. He will pub-
lish a book about the war he’ll never see.
The Presbyterian Church of Australia, in
passing a pious anti-German resolution, in-
cidentally deplored “the ruthless destruction
of inoffensve cattle.” Alas, dear friends, it
makes very little difference to the inoffensive
cattle whether they are destroyed by the
vandals of war or the slaughtermen of
peace! Only a Vegetarian Assembly is en-
titled to weep thus for the conversion of live
stock into dead meat by a ruthless foe,
though the beefiest among us may well
deplore the fact that Drought hath its hor-
rible tragedies no less than War, millions of
sheep being condemned to a slow, painful
death by Fat owners, who decide to “risk
it,” rather than pay the big prices that other
Fatmen demand for grass and water.
“R,”: Geo. Reid, with his marvellous
ability to prophesy after the event, writes to
London Times and instances Broken Hill
as being “largely dependent on German pur-
chasers.” “The war,” he declares, too. “has
justified Australia’s naval and military
policy.” There have been many galls—large,
influential galls—but there never was a gall
to beat G. Reid’s. When he had power in
Australia he stuck to the idiotic fiscalism
bv which England has given Germany some
of the money to fight her with. He fought
Australia’s naval and military policy, which
he now (after the event) regards as “justi-
fied” —fought it on the grounds of “loyalty,”
his being one of those peculiarly-unbalanced
minds which regards the married son who
buys his own furniture as “disloyal” because
he didn’t take his bride to camp with - his
mother. There can be no worse Australian
than G. Iteid; and as a prophet after the
event, and the possessor of a gall, he rfthks
with Wilhelm 11. But Wilhelm 11. set his
house in order before making an ass of mtn-
self, while G. Reid would have left us naked
to our enemies.

Fireproof Permasite Plate Wall, which stands intact amid Calcined Ruins of Agricultural Show Grandstand,
n The recent fire at the Agricultural Showgrounds, Melbourne, which destroyed the Grandstand, the Industrial Pavilion
Ld mlnvSther buildinjif was witnessed by thousands of people, and one remarkable feature of the fire was that a little
h ill constructed St6u?2 yeafs ago by the Permasite Coy. Pty. Ltd., of 375 Collins Street, Melbourne, withstood
the fierce heat and the above illustration should settle all arguments as to the fire-proof qualities of Peimasite.
The building was constructed with Permasite throughout, one wall being 2%in. thick and the other 4m. th .
A When the fire had burned itself out it was the only structure remaining. All the rest had been swept clean. The
nhotograph is by Darge, of Collins Street, Melbourne. The building proved a great attraction to the country people who
Fnsnected same, to ascertain the kind of material that could possibly live through the centre of the fire zone
n tF addition to the heat large burning beams from the roof of the Industrial Pavilion fell upon the structure, and
added to the risk of total destruction. The Building to-day is as good as the day it was put up, without crack or the

OBJECTS, REPORTS, &c.:
The principal object of the Company is to acquire and develop the undertaking and property of
The Dalmayne Collieries Company Proprietary Limited, including coal-mining leases of an area of 1972
acres, situate about 8 miles from St. Mary’s, and about 44 miles from Port Seymour, Tasmania.
Thus it is situated in a belt containing enormous quantities of first-class coal, which are as yet
practically untouched.
200,000,000 tons of coal, valued at £100,000,000 stg., have been raised in Australia up to the end
of 1913; 12,500,000 tons being produced in 1913 —the bulk in New South Wales —of which over
6,000,000 tons were exported. The consumption of coal in Victoria is estimated at about 2,000,000
tons annually, and in South Australia at about 1,000,000 tons annually.
According to the estimates of experts, the cost of Dalmayne coal, delivered at the ship’s side, will
not be more than half that of Newcastle coal, owing to the Dalmayne coal measures being in regular
layers, and the coal being won by tunnelling; this obviates the necessity for shaft sinking and the
consequent haulage.
THE QUALITY OF DALMAYNE COAL IS ADMIRABLE, AND COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH
THE NEWCASTLE AND SOUTH COAST COALS, AND IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO WONTHAGGI AND
OTHER VICTORIAN COAL. It is practically smokeless, and does not clinker, the Newcastle coals
having disadvantages in these respects. In position the Dalmayne Collieries are very favorably situated,
the Newcastle mines being roughly twice as far as Dalmayne from Melbourne and Adelaide respectively,
which will primarily be the principal markets for Dalmayne coal.
Mr. J. D. Miles, general manager of the Mount Bischoff Company, reported upon five of the seams
contained in 700 acres of the Company’s property, and says that the thickness of these seams is respec-
tively 4 feet 3 inches, 4 feet 2 inches, 13 feet, 30 feet and 3 feet. Excerpts from his report are as
follow: —
• Of the main tunnel (13 feet) he says:—
At the 126-foot peg a rise has been put up exposing 12 feet of good coal in two seams, with a band
of clay between them, but in the coal itself there are no bands. The seafns are found to improve
greatly as they go under the hill. THIS THEN FORMS A VERY HIGHLY PAYABLE SEAM
FOR WORKING, AND FROM MY INVESTIGATIONS MANY THOUSAND TONS ARE AVAILABLE
FROM IT.
Again, he says:— . *
There is an immense seam outcropping along what has been a creek-bed, having a thickness of about
30 feet altogether, and wonderfully free from bands even at the surface, which is exposed. Not
much work has been done on the seam so far, but THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT IN
MY MIND THAT IT WILL OPEN UP A MAGNIFICENT ONE, AND ONE FROM WHICH MAY
BE TAKEN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF THIS FOSSIL FUEL. THE COKE OBTAINED FROM
THIS COAL IS EXCELLENT, being well swollen, with slight, cauliflower-like excrescences, firm
and lustrous.
THE SEAMS ALREADY OPENED UP AND EXPOSED ON THE PROPERTY BEING OF SUCH A SIZE,
MUST PROVE TO BE OF GREAT COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE.
Mr. John Evans, F.G.S., describes the coal from the main tunnel as being “compact, exceedingly
firm, clean to handle; makes little slack, burns with fierce heat, somewhat short, smokeless flames, and
deposits practically no soot in stoves. I consider this coal in every way superior to the Collie (Western
Australia) coal, with which I have had a very extensive experience.’’ And adds: —
The coal kindles easily, gives off great heat, and burns away till the last atom of carbon is consumed.
It does not throw off, like Newcastle coals, floating particles of unconsumed carbon, which make
the use of highly bitumenous coals objectionable in the home. The smokeless nature of this coal
must commend itself to the residents of the ever-growing cities of the Commonwealth on hygienic
lines alone.
IT IS ESTIMATED THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 28,000,000 TONS OF COAL ON THE COM-
PANY’S PROPERTY, WHICH CAN BE LANDED AT MELBOURNE AT ABOUT 10/6 PER TON.
Copies of both reports can be inspected at the Company’s Offices, 339 Collins Street, Melbourne.
The annual output of coal when the mine is fully equipped is estimated at 150,000 tons, and the net
profit at £43,000 per annum.
At date of publication of the abridged prospectus the Tasmanian Govern-
ment is obtaining reports on the adjacent harbors, and is giving its practical
support by submitting a vote of £5OOO to Parliament for the erection of wharfage
facilities for Dalmayne Coal.

The German can still make a joke. To
the protest against German vandalism
drawn up by a number of “British art
lovers,” the Vossische Zeitung replies that
whereas the Germans remained at Coni-
peigne for a fortnight without damaging
the town, the British hadn’t been there
more than a few hours before they destroyed
the beautiful stone quarries. The grimness
of the joke lies in the fact that the Germans
were shelled out of the “beautiful quarries.
George Kinchington, who died in the
north of Victoria the other day, crossed the
Murray ■ with his parents in ISoS. They
got over the stream at Albury, and were the
first white people to do the deed at that
spot. The family fixed upon a site on the
Iviewa River for a home, and there George
Kinchington lived for the rest of his hte.
The Kincliingtons grew the first crop ol
wheat in that northern part of the btate,
an old wooden plough being used to break
up the virgin soil. In 1841 young Kinching-
ton paid his first visit to Melbourne, getting
there at the tail of some fat cattle. lhe
bullocks brought 13s. 6d. per nead. To
even things up a bit, when the gold rush
to the Beechworth district took place in the
’so’s, Kinchington realised £42 a ton for
hay and £l3O a ton for flour.
“Moana”: A lot of wild stories are float-
ing round re the explosives that are being
used in the war in Europe. Lurid tales have
been printed apropos the allegedly marvel-
lous explosive, invented by Turpin, .which
was reported to have killed Germans in the
trenches in great numbers and to have
“covered the bodies with a reddish powder
and left them standing upright.” About the
only true item in this story is the fact that
there is a Turpin. He invented an explo-
sive, which is used by the French in
their shells. But it doesn’t leave a reddish
powder and it certainly doesn’t leave any-
thing it has struck standing upright. Nobody
stands upright when he is dead except a
United States soldier from Chicago. Similar
stories about a yellowish powder and ot
men being found dead standing up were
circulated at the time of the Boer war when
the British first began to use lyddite. They
were all moonshine. There is really no
great mystery surrounding the explosives
used by the great Powers. They are all
similar. The British use cordite as
their propellent and lyddite as their
shell explosive. The other Powers use
the same things, but under different names.
Cordite is a mixture of nitroglycerine, gun-
cotton and mineral jelly, to which is added
acetone. Germany and France use it with
small quantities of other substances added
to increase the stability and safety of the
compound. Lyddite is picric acid melted and
poured into the shells. The French melinite
is ditto, and the German explosive is ditto.
When Turpin invented melinite he. followed
the French war authorities round with hand-
fulls of it until they were frightened of
being blown skyward, and decided to test it.
The experts found it was just lyddite, so
they took it without payment and started to
make it. Whereat Turnin himself exploded
violently, and was finally jugged, fined and
exiled for selling the secret to foreign
powers.
“D.”: Herewith an instance of the un-
varying character of human nature, no mat-
ter what the social class. I know two Ger-
mans. Both their occupations are gone now,
but one was a boots at an hotel before the
war began, and the other was a wool-buyer.
I met the boots outside the G.P.O. half an
hour ago, and perceiving that he wore a
well-marked black eye, inquired what was
the trouble. He said it had been given to
him by a wharf-lumper “for being a Ger-
man.” I asked had he been talking of the
Fatherland in an arrogant fashion. He
declared that he had not mentioned the word
“Germany” for a month, that he hated the
■ war and regarded the Kaiser as a calamity
—or words to that effect. He gave it as his
opinion that the lower order of local work-
ing man has no sense of fairness, much less
chivalry, and is prepared to put it across
any German, at the present time, without
provocation, on the broad grounds that he
(the Teuton) is, for the moment, in the
position of a lame and friendless dog. This
unfortunate man has no money; he has been
fired out of his job ; and he has no prospect
of getting another one. It stands to the
credit of the better sort of Australian
workers that some of them are helping to
keep him from starvation. The unemployed
wool-buyer is financially independent. He
would not be a safe proposition to assault,
being large and powerful. Besides, in the
circle in which he moves there is little done
in the assault and battery line. Another
method is employed, accordingly, to make
his existence as intolerable as possible. Every
other rabbit-faced elerkling who knows him
by sight, or has heard his name, has some
preposterous story to retail about him —a
story which, if believed, would stamp the
subject of it not only as a dangerous char-
acter but as a gibbering lunatic. One gossip-
| mongerer hurled himself distractedly at the
writer, with the following, the other day:
“My God! that fellow, Blank, should be
hounded out of the country. He ought to
be flogged and put in gaol. On Saturday
night at the Imperial Salon the scoundrel
bounded on to a table and shouted: ‘Three
cheers for Germany !’ ” I asked the narrator
if he had been there and heard the words.
He hadn’t, but he had got his information
“on good authority.” Did he know the
accused? No. Would he be astonished to
learn that Blank was particularly reserved
as regards the war —that his personal friends
were unable to get a word out of him on the
subject? He would; he had it on good
authority that Blank howled insults at the
British Empire on every possible occasion.
And so on. It is a manifestation of the
same spirit that impels the baser sort of
wharf-lumpers to assail their Teuton com-
rade. The only differences are that the
lumper tries to injure the enemy’s body while
the elerkling goes for his reputation; and
that the lumper’s attack is a frontal one,
while the other’s is from behind. Neither
operation has the remotest connection with
patriotism or decent feeling of any sort. The
Germans who have the bad luck to be
stranded in Australia at the present time
are in the position of men who are down.
To a certain rather miserable type it seems
the obvious thing, in the circumstances, to
have a kick.
Two specimens of the real, old-fashioned
miser have been found near Kapunda (S.A.).
They were middle-aged brother and sister, of
German extraction, who lived alone in a
country place; and when at last they were
sent to what Adelaide now delicately calls
the Mental Hospital, a constable who searched
their house found treasure everywhere —in
pickle bottles, and buried in tins, and tucked
into, the thatch of the stable roof. Some of
the gold was black with age, and the kero-
sene tins were rusted away with long burial.
The total haul was £3OO in notes and 900
sovereigns.
Conrad Eitel, who, with Captain Travers
and Lieutenant Bond, went ahead of the
troops in New Britain, and captured seven
. Germans and 20 natives at the wireless sta-
-1 tion, was at insurance work in Adelaide
before he turned into the Inky Way. Later,
he joined Sydney Telegraph, but detached
| himself to act as secretary of the Mawson
] Antarctic Expedition. When Australia’s
contingent for the Pacific was being formed,
he was the first pressman to volunteer, though
a number of journalists and artists have
since joined, among them being Chester
Reynolds, J. B. Higginson, “Tommy Corn-
stalk” Abbott and Jack Somers. Higginson
and Abbott had experience in the Boer war.


Started with Pimple.. Spread to
Sore. Cuticura Ointment Made
Complete Cure. Hair Thick.
Eden Park, Whittlesea, Vic.—“l had
suffered for about three months with severe
irritation of the scalp and loss of hair. It
started about the size of a small pimple,
very sore on the top of my head, and I tried
ointment but without success, and it spread
to a sore about the size of the palm of your
hand, and the hair was coming out of the
affected parts. A friend advised me to buy
a tin of Cuticura Ointment. Thanks to
my friend for recommending it I have saved
any further expense from buying anything
more for it because it has made a complete
cure, and my hair has grown as thick as
on any other part of my head.
“As for the Cuticura Soap, I would use
no other now; I have great faith in it. If
1 feel tired after my day’s hard work I just
warm a copper of water and take a warm
bath and make a good lather of the Cuti-
cura Soap and I feel quite refreshed, and
it takes all the pains out of my limbs, which
I was subject to before using the Cuticura
Soap.” (Signed) Samuel Bai'ry, June 24,
1912.
For red, rough, chapped and bleeding
hands, itching, burning palms, and painful
finger-ends with shapeless nails, a one-night
Cuticura treatment works wonders. Soak
hands, on retiring, in hot water and Cuticura
Soap. Dry, anoint with Cuticura Ointment
and wear soft bandages or old, loose gloves
during the night. Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment are also indispensable for treating
pimples, blackheads and itching, scaly scalps
with dandruff. Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment are sold throughout the world, j

ANAEMIA
and Weakness
in Men, Women, and Children
Dr. ANDREW WILSON writes:
“It can be definitely stated
“that Iron ‘Jelloids’ c' itute
“ the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poor-
“ness of Blood. The sufferer is able
“to take Iron ‘Jelloids’ without danger,
“ even with pleasure, and with the sure
“knowledge that benefit will accrue.”
and “ MEN AND TONICS.”
“ There is a curious notion entertained by
“ the General Public that Iron Medicaments
“ are necessary for women only, and not for
“Men. This is an erroneous idea. Now I
“ have found the form of Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ put
“up with Quinine (called Iron ‘Jelloids’
“No. 2a) to be an excellent tonic for men,
“and may be specially recommended.”
å
Breathing, hurried and gasping, on the slightest exertion, pale cheeks
lacking the ruddy glow of health, bloodless lips, a general feeling of weari-
ness-accompanied maybe by pain after food, indigestion—constipation,
listlessness, inability of application to any pursuit or even train of thought
depression of spirits, and irritability of temper. Such symptoms indicate
Ansemia, and should, on no account, be neglected.
Iron ‘Jelloids’
will remove the causes and symptoms of Anaemia. Iron is
what your system requires. By taking it in the form of Iron
‘Jelloids’ the not uncommon disadvantages of other Iron
tonics are avoided. No ill-effects are set up. No constipation.
No “rust ”in the stomach. No danger of non-absorption.
No fear of injury to the teeth. If you would have radiant
health, an elastic step and well braced nerves, you must
have healthy blood. To improve and strengthen the blood
take Iron ‘Jelloids,’ commended by Medical Men, and
favourably reviewed by the Medical Press. As a general
tonic Iron ‘Jelloids ’ are excellent. They are pleasant and
easy to take.
A Reliable Tonic
Mr FJ. Warne. 108, Edith Road. West Kensington, W., writes “ I
find Iron ‘jelloids’ satisfactory in every way. I may mention .since you
state Iron ‘Jelloids’ would be invaluable for Anaemia that my wife has
deriv'd more benefit from them for that complaint than from anything
else.”
A Fortnight s Trial (price 1/6) will
con ice you.

The small politician has curious ways of
advertising lnmseif, like Dickens’s politi-
cian who proposed to move the House of
. Commons about the mysterious disappear-
ance of a potboy. Thus llagnall. ALL.A.,
of N.S.W., filled the House on a recent day
with a complaint that people who had
bought pianos on time-payment wore still
required to keep up the instalments, despite
the war in Europe. If this great, rich coun-
try ever sees real war, worse things than a.
piano instalment will happen to it. Inci-
dentally, Australia has a piano industry of
its own, and it makes very good pianos. Yet
most people have the importing craze and the
anti-Australian disease so badly that they
insist pxr buying the German article, and per-
sistently supply Germany with funds so that
it may fight against the British Empire. The
average piano-buyer deserves to pay his
instalments.
The lament of “Croson” :
Victoria is one of those States that do nothing with
the maximum of pomp and circumstance. And as
long as it goes on having Liberal Governments it
will be the same. Bent started to do many things,
and then forgot about them; Weary slept and did
nothing-; Watt talked and did nothing; Peacock
laughs and does nothing. A dozen measures have
been thrashed out till the electors are sick of the
names of them. Yet no genuine effort is made to
enact one of them. The other day Peacock’s Assembly
wasted almost a whole sitting- toying with a measure
called the Public Contracts Bill. It has six clauses,
and the chief of them stipulates that contractors shall
pay wages that are “fair and not less than those
usually paid.” This blessed piece of legislation got
as far as its second reading. Peacock is hereby
advised when he returns from the country —if he does
return—to avoid fooling with such trilies as the
Greater Melbourne Bill and the Health Bill, and
devote his attention to measures enacting that banks
shall pay such dividends as their profits will allow;
that builders contracting to erect houses shall con-
struct at least four walls and a roof; that persons
caught in the act of stealing shall be considered
petty larcenists, and so forth. Thus will he go on
running true to Liberal type as heretofore.
As usual, Maoriland is in the front line
with the drum and cymbals. Here is one
day’s batch, published for general admira-
tion :
To bis Majesty King George IV.: —
New Zealand desires me to thank your Majesty for
your gracious message, which I have personally com-
municated. The people of the Dominion consider it
their privilege to be connected with everything- which
affects the welfare of the British Empire, and are
proud to be associated with the United Kingdom and
all the dependencies of the Crown in the present
tremendous issue, which must be carried to a satis-
factory conclusion whatever may be the cost. To this
end the people of New Zealand are prepared to
make any sacrifice that may be required of them.
(Signed) Liverpool,.
To his Excellency the Viceroy of India: —
New Zealand desires to express unbounded admira-
tion at the splendid response to the Empire’s call
made by all the inhabitants of the mighty Indian
Empire and the bordering friendly States.
(Signed) Liverpool.
To his Imperial Majesty the Tsar:—
New Zealand desires to express her unbounded
admiration at the magnificent achievements of their
allies, the Russian troops, which will add fresh lustre
to their arms. —(Signed) Liverpool.
To the President of the French Republic:—-
New Zealand desires to express her whole-hearted
congratulations to the French troops, who, with out-
own kith and kin, have been fighting so nobly in the
cause of right and liberty. (Signed) Liverpool.
To his Majesty the King of the Belgians:—
New Zealand desires to express her profound
admiration at the heroic stand which the Belgian
people are making against the common foe to main-
tain the honor and integrity of their country.
(Signed) Liverpool.
Liverpool is tlie Governor. Two-thirds of
his name suggests a cow’s internals, and
one-tliird suggests some stagnant water.
The Dominion be governs probably paid
for the cablegrams out of loan money. And
instead of offering the hard-pressed Allies
£5.000,000 or so as its contribution it is
still clamoring for loan money.
“0.K.” speaks a piece:—
Granting that the German legions have wrought all
the gratuitous ruin and despoliation charged against
them, there is no reason why poetic retributive justice
should not be dealt out to Germany in due course.
The Prussians are “the road hogs of Europe,” says
Lloyd George, whose language mostly errs on the side
of exaggeration. They are Goths, Vandals and any
other sort of barbarians when they invade foreign
cities in battle array. They destroy works of art for
destruction’s sake, even as the common or public-
garden Australian larrikin chips off the nose of a
Venus de Stucco. Good, or, rather, had. To punish
senseless brutality in Louvain, Rheims or thereabouts
with insensate brutality in Germany would be
absurd. If in the names of civilisation and
culture we protest against vandalism we
cannot maintain an attitude of honor after
perpetrating vandalism, in revenge. Civilisa-
tion cannot wantonly destroy beautiful and sacred
things. One smash doesn’t deserve another. Nor
can tire losses that Belgium and France have sus-
tained in historic monuments be repaired with Ger-
man cash. llow, then, is poetic retributory justice to
be done? By shifting the art treasures of, say, the
Munich and Dresden galleries to Belgian and French
institutions'. Napoleon, in his time, stole many pic-
tures and things from the foreign cities he ruthlessly
invaded. He had no justification save the doctrine
of spoils to the- victor. The Allied Powers, if they
ever get to Munich and Dresden, will have real justi-
fication for rifling- the famous galleries of their con-
tents —presuming, of course, that allied • troops have
performed no acts of wanton destruction in other
German towns. If they enter the local strongholds of
Culture with tolerably clean hands their commanders
can say:-
Behold. Germany has forfeited all moral right to
the possession of art treasures. These are as pearls
in a hog-sty or fine gold in a sausage. The bar-
barians who have brutally kicked the graceful form
of civilisation, and stabbed it to its very sold, are
unfit custodians of things which only the lViglier-
minded nations can property value and enjoy. In the
midst of the Kaiser’s bragging, beery camp a paint-
ing of the Virgin, by Murillo, seems to plead for
removal to a .count'-/ where militarism is less ram-
pant and Thought is less unspiritual—-where the holier
emotions have not been crushed by drill sergeants,
and every man is free to retain his individuality.
Therefore shall the contents of these galleries be
packed up and labelled “Reasonable Compensation,”
and taken in triumphant waggons to Paris and
Brussels.
All this is suggested on the supposition that the
Allies may eventually be in a position to do unto
Germany as she has done unto them. Poetic justice
may get there next year, but she mustn’t be bustled,
or she will never get there at all.

Australian Favorites —
Gwen Burroughs
and REXONA.
Dear Sirs, —
You have heard I have been
using' Rexona and Rexona Soap.
This is quite true, and I want to
tell you what I think of them.
They are both simply excellent. I
always keep a pot of Rexona on
my dressing-table, and consider it
simply indispensable. I always
use it after Surfing, and find it
simply splendid for Sunburn, and for
preserving the skin.
As for Rexona Soap, it is wonder-
ful how lovely it makes the hair —so
soft and silky, and it is so refreshing.
I think every girl should use Rexona

A habit formed is hard to break. Bad
habits are easily formed, but good habits can
be attained almost as easily. The Rexona
habit results in health and beauty, and once
formed will never be broken. f
There are two Rexona habits —that of
using Rexona Ointment to heal all injuries
to the skin, and the Rexona Soap
habit, which consists of keeping one-
self clean and pure with a delicately-
scented and medicated soap. Rexona
Ointment and Rexona Soap mean skin
health and beauty, comfort to the user,
and immunity from disease. So form
the Rexona habit. Start with a
Is. cake of Rexona Soap and a
Is. 6d. pot of Ointment. Soon
you will be glad to
know that Rexona

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rUE seas are safe. Who doubts it?
Ask of the 'Wheeling gulls
That in the dawn have circled,
With startled cries have circled,
Above swift-running hulls.
When hills and sky and water
Were lit by sunset’s flame,
In serried ranks, down-channel,
The sea-bound steamers came —
The high-bowed ocean liner,
The little coaster lean,
The tramps that trade to Nowhere
And all the Ports Between —
A smoking, brave flotilla,
They turned and steamed away
To northward and to southward
In waning light of day.
The lighthouse lamps were hooded ;
When night came down they burned
With lessened light, yet ever
The lantern turned and turned ;
But other beams more vivid
Were there. They searched aud pryed
For any ocean danger
The gathered dark might hide.
Hither they leaped and thither
The searchlights blazed and streamed
Seeking for aught that floated,
For anything that steamed.
Nay, there was naught out yonder
Beyond the port patrol,
With red lamps in her rigging
A-swinging to her roll.
But, dim between the headlands
A black, lean hull went past.
No lights, save one lamp winking
A password, from her mast.
Behind her came another;
They steered away to go.
And guard the heedless steamers
That sailed at sunset glow.
One steered nor’-east, the other
Went southward. It may be
A laggard ship would see her,
Black on a moonless sea.
Or. in the middle watches,
Some steamer steering north
Would glimpse her stumpy funnels
With black smoke pouring forth;
And calling her by Morse-light
Might win a curt reply
To calm her captain’s wonder
At what was racing by.
When dawnlight greyed the ocean,
Two shadows, grey and lean,
Moved swiftly and in silence
The harbor gates between.
And as they passed, a message
They signalled, so men tell:
“All’s clear to north and southward ;
To eastward, all is well.”
And then these hounds whose hunting
Had won for them no prize
Stole o’er the waking harbor
That seemed to rub its eyes.
And. out beyond the headland
Beyond the port patrol,
In dawnlight clear, the steamers
Swung to the ocean’s roll.
By ones and twos they gathered,
A smoking, misty host.
From northern port and river
And southern bar and coast.
And when the sun leaped heavenward
Into the port they steamed,
Past channel-lights that flickered
And harbor-lamps that dreamed.
The seas are safe! None doubt it.
Hut few there be who tell
They saw those two destroyers,
These grim, grey, lean destroyers.
Whose message was “All’s Well:’

WILL LAWSON.
Advertisement Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“"T7"ES-i>, that’s good enough.” The
I journalist passed back the carefully-
polished set of verses about the
beauties of Sydney Harbor to the poet, and
sighed wearily as if he had just had a com-
pliment extracted without chloroform.
The poet gloomily stowed away the pro-
duct of many loving hours in his breast
pocket. “I ought to get five bob, or tup-
pence or something for it in a week or so.”
The journalist finished his drink and sat
up. “I say, old man,- you’re wasting your
time writing that stuff. I know it’s good
fun to write just what you want, but there’s
not enough money in it. Now I can tell
you how to make a few guineas in as many
minutes, if you’ll take it on.”
The poet allowed himself to look inter-
ested.
“It’s an advertising job. The Babblejack
Disinfectant Company are putting a new
combustible disinfectant on the market, and
they want a couple of catchy verses for the
hoardings. It ought to be dead easy for
you. Would you care to take it on?”
The writer of verses smiled in a bitter
way. “I’ve never tried disinfectant as a
theme, but if there’s any money in it”
“Bight, you are,” said the journalist. “Look
here, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll ring
up the Babblejack people right now and
i ell them yon are on your way. Jump on a
Glebe tram at the door—it will take you
straight out to the works. See you later
on here.” He turned to the ’phone, and the
poet took up his hat and weut out like a
man in a dream.
Half an hour later a young clerk ushered
the rhymester into an office occupied by a
small and excessively polite man. who begged
him almost tearfully to sit down and make
himself thoroughly comfortable. Advertise-
ments about disinfectants hung all round
the walls; tinned and bottled disinfectants
stood on every shelf and projection; and
loose disinfectant thinly powdered the
papers on the little man’s desk. He him-
self had a smudge of disinfectant on the
lapel of his coat. A golden shaft of after-
noon sunlight showed the atmosphere to be
full of disinfectant particles. The buzz aud
clatter of a big office staff, writing and
figuring about disinfectant, filtered through
the partition.
When the writer had finished noting these
things in the idle and disorderly fashion
for which the tribe is noted, he discovered
that the busy and abject little man was
shuffling advertising matter in front of him
and gabbling reverently of Babblejac-k’s New
Combustible Disinfectant as though it were
something fresh from a heavenly laboratory.
As the poet listened he discovered that all
Babblejack’s preparations were miracle-
working things which enabled the world to
revolve. In fact, the world only revolved
because of Babblejack. The little man
rattled on feverishly, and the inattentive
versifier thought: “Yes, he is a finer poet
than I am —a finer disinfectant poet, that
is. He should write this disinfectant epic
himself instead of calling me in.” Pre-
sently he became aware that the little man
had quite run down and was looking plead-
ingly at him.
“Er— would you mind explaining that
again—to make quite sure, you know?”
The little man gladly started the rhap-
sody again from the very beginning. Babble-
jack’s Disinfectant evidently was the one
thing in the whole world that he thoroughly
understood and loved. As a matter of fact,
when his wife gave evenings, it was his
habit to single out the most receptive-look-
ing guest present and talk Babblejack’s Dis-
infectant to him till his head swam. He
never wanted a second request for an en-
core.
By handcuffing and leg-ironing his atten-
tion the poet gradually gathered what was
required of him. The little man feverishly
summarised it for him at the end of a
whole hour’s jabbering: “Just four lines or
less, because a man going by in a train or
tram hasn’t time to read any more. What
we want you to say is this: “Babblejack’s
New Combustible Disinfectant, put up in
airtight tins. Non-Poisonous. Price One-
and-Six.” You can add anything else you
like but Mr. Babblejack must have those
words in.”
The verse carpenter scratched his nose
attentively.
“That’s all, I think.” mumbled the pre-
occupied little man. “Oh. yes! We’d like
you to fix it up so that it goes with a swing
like that cough-lozenge verse.” His eyes
glazed over and he started to recite in a
dreamy sing-song :—•
That troublesome coughing you’ll very soon stop
By taking a Bumblcehunk Hickory Drop.
“I’ve never forgot that!” he cried plain-
tively. “I carn’t forget it! It sorter Sticks
in Me Head!” He brooded awhile on the
deathless lines, ere handing the poet a mass
of advertising matter and a presentation
tin of the New Combustible. “We’d like it
as soon as possible,” he concluded, and
wavered nervously towards the door. The
verse writer, sneezing disinfectant, made his
way out of the commercial hive and retired
in mental disorder to the place where he
usually did his writing. On arrival he sat
down at his desk and started on the job
right away. After twenty minutes’ hard
thinking and a number of false starts and
erasures, lie took his writing-pad and
scribbled this :
Babblejack’s New Disinfectant wins!
Non-Poisonous! Put up in airtight tins !
The youngsters can’t get up to any tricks!
Combustible ! Try it! it’s One-and-Six !
The hireling bard sat back and critically
inspected his work. “That seems all right.
I have packed all the disgraceful infor-
mation in and mentioned the price. It's a
bit of a squeeze, but it’s all there.” He
addressed an envelope to the manager of
the Babblejack Co., and enclosed the poem
with a polite note requesting to be informed
if it would suit.
Next day he got a reply from the exces-
sively polite little man who had instructed
him. The little man. so abject in his office,
proved to be a veritable Napoleon of the
typewriter. A characteristic letter from him
to Wellington would have crumpled up the
Iron Duke and done away with the neces-
sity for Waterloo. He wrote in the ap-
proved majestic strain of the business man :
Dear Sir, —We are in receipt of the poem ordered
from you yesterday, and must say we are surprised
that you should have troubled to send us such a shoddy
article. Surely the divine afflatus could not have
been caught at the flood ! The preparation re which
you twang your lyre, i.e., “Babblejack’s New Dis-
infectant” is one of which we have, as yet, no know-
ledge whatever. If we remember rightly, we asked
you to give us something re “Babblejack’s New
Combustible Disinfectant.” By putting the word
“Combustible” into the fourth line of your poem
you destroy the identity of our preparation at one
stroke of the pen. We would again remind you that
it is our ambition to make this a household word,
and it is most important, therefore,' that the whole
title should be given, so that the reader may have
it engraved on his mind. We consider it inadvisable
at this juncture to enter into a detailed criticism of
your poem, as its crudities are too numerous. We
would, however, point out that there is a great lack
of dignity about it. You are shrieking at the buyer
all the time —a thing we have always been most
careful to avoid. When approaching the public with
an article of such undoubted merit you should do so
gravely and reverently, yet with a certain air of
respectful confidence, thereby giving the impression
that the buyer is a man of ripe judgment to whom
an article cf worth must appeal. If you will keep
this ideal before you and strive for a little more
refinement, you may get the divine afflatus going
again on our behalf. Please forward your next
attempt promptly to our Mr. Clatter, who in-
structed you and has this matter in hand.
Trusting you will give this your prompt attention,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed—with a flourish) J. W. F. G. Z. Clatter.
The new advertisement laureate, after
reading the message through twice, turned
down a corner of the sprightly Mr. Clatter’s
composition, and wrote in a neat, round
hand, “Oh, you go to Hell!” But, as he
was enveloping it he hesitated, shook his
head, and grunted, “No, d —n him ! I want
the money Then he stowed the long-
winded impertinence in his pocket and started
what proved to be a whole strenuous evening
of battle with the New Combustible.
The devilish quality of the job fascinated
him. The English language is a beauti-
ful thing, but it has its limitations. Verse
cannot lie made with a hydraulic press, and
the perspiring writer played with the im-
possible Clatter’s unmusical and irregular
lengths of information like a Chinese puzzle,

DON’T NEGLECT YOUR KIDNEYS.
The kidneys and bladder need occasional attention just as much as the bowels, especially
after colds, exposure and over-work, or when the kidneys are over-excited by beer, spirits or tea.
The brain rests while we sleep. So do the muscles. Even the digestive system slackens.
But the kidneys never rest. Night as well as day they keep on with their great work of filter-
ing the blood —if they did not you could not live more than a few days, for the urinous waste
left in the blood would poison the whole system.
That is why the early symptoms of kidney trouble are much the same as those of slow
poisoning—you feel as if you could fall off to sleep at any time of the day; you seem to
have no energy, no ambition ; the ankles and limbs may be dropsical, the joints get rheu-
matic. The water contains a brickdust sediment, there is pain in emptying the bladder, and
you may be obliged to seek relief every few minutes.
When the kidneys are in a weak and exhausted condition they have no chance to rest
and pick up their strength. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills give them just the help they
need. This remedy is solely for the kidney's and bladder ; its ingredients are of the highest
quality and absolute purity, and quickly help the kiineys to throw off the poisonous waste
and surplus water which cause dropsy, inflammation of the kidneys and bladder gravel,
stone, lumbago and rheumatism.

SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
PADDINGTON
Mr. .J. H. Pelgrave, 4 5 Gipps Street, Paddington, Sydney, writes: "I think it
ray duty to say, for the benefit of other sufferers from weak kidneys and urinary
trouble, that I have found nothing so effectual for these ailments as Uoan's Back-
ache Kidney Bills, and I hope the publishing of this testimonial will be the means
of benefiting many. Nearly all my life I have suffered a lot from weak kidneys,
and urinary trouble, and have taken all sorts of medicines in the hope of finding
a cure, but none of them did me any good. I have also been under medical men,
but their treatment also failed to benefit me in any way. I was advised to take a
course of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I am delighted to tell you these Pills
cured me, and I feel in better health now than I have done for years. I cannot
praise this remedy sufficiently for the good it has done me.”
Two years later Mr. Pelgrave says: “Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me
of kidney trouble over two years ago, and I have still the same good opinion of this
grand remedy.”
MANLY,
Mrs. E. Thompson, 194 Pittwater Road, Manly, Sydney, says: “For ’• -ars I
suffered agony from backache and lumbago. 1 was so bad that 1 could scarcely
get about, and always felt tired, languid and depressed. Other symptoms which
clearly showed my kidneys were very much out of order were headaches, dizziness
and irregular secretions. I tried many different remedies, which were supposed to
cure kidney trouble, but derived no benefit from them. At last I decided to try
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and only wish I had got them long before, they
would have saved me a lot of pain. After taking a couple oP bottles, I felt ever so
much better, so I continued using the Rills until I was quite cured. Considering
how very ill I was I think it marvellous that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
cured me so thoroughly. It is eight years since I was cured, and I have been well
ever since.”
Mrs. Thompson confirms the above two years later: “I am still well, and have
had no return of backache and lumbago since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me ten years ago.”

per bottle , or from Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street ,
trying always to link on to the staggering-
line, “Babblejack’s New Combustible Disin-
fectant.” Occasionally, amidst the welter
of rhymes, he would get a complete version
that would almost satisfy him. But, invari-
ably, on comparing it with Clatter’s speci-
fications, he would find it lacking in about
four different essentials. Generally he
would discover with a start of horror that
he had only won out by omitting some vital
word like “Combustible” or “airtight.” Once
lie actually omitted to call it “Disinfectant.’
All the versions, .so he sorrowfully admitted
to himself, were lacking in dignity and
refinement. lie wrote down the famous
Bumblechunk model, and grew hot with rage
when he saw how little information the
unknown author had had to supply re the
wonderful Drop. He merely mentioned that
it consisted of, or was branded “Hickory,”
and closed down with a slam. Then what a
beautifully resonant and accommodating
name Bumblechunk was! It suggested to
his ear a brief solo on a bass drum. He
seized the tattered remains of his writing
pad and wrote a passionate letter of protest
to the dreadful Clatter, pointing out the
frightful disadvantages he was working under
and pleading eloquently to be allowed another
couple of lines to turn round in. When lie
had quite finished he uttered a despairing
cry and pushed the thing from him. saying.
“Oh. this is too d—d trivial!” And then he
started again and fought on till' the night
was all gone and his patience in rags.
It was 4.25 when he started his final
letter: —
Dear Bounder (later altered to “Dear Sir”), —
I find T am unable to undertake the advertising-
piffle (“work”) with which you were rash enough
(“good enough”) to entrust me. Trust you will be
able to find another damned fool (“writer”) to
undertake it.
Damn you (“Yours faithfully”),
John Bardlet.
The frazzled poet felt almost cheery when
ho had closed the commercial idiocy with his
curt note, and he set to with a will and
tidied up the moss he had made. Before re-
tiring he went out and dropped his letter
in the dew-wet post-box. Afterwards he
slept like a tired child. And next morning
he awoke to bright sunlight with the exult-
ant feeling that comes after a dark cloud has
passed over.
The day pased gaily, and when he came
home and found an envelope of the Babble-
jack Co. he opened it with a sort of amused
interest. Half a dozen glances at the type-
empurpled sheet, and all his gladness and
urbanity had passed from him and lie was
a foaming madman. Through some ghastly
mistake lie had torn up his withering note
of resignation and posted the hysterical letter
containing his frantic appeal for just two
more lines to save his metrical soul in : and
the relentless Napoleon of the typewriter had
written hack sarcastically refusing, under
any circumstances whatever, to grant him the
prayed-for extension. He also threatened to
take the job out of his incompetent hands and
give it to one of his clerks, unless he promptly
abased himself and showed some faint signs
of intelligence.
The maddened poet has not sent a reply
to that yet. He puts in half his time com-
posing insulting letters; then he spends the
other half showing them to literary friends
and asking if, in their opinions, the expres-
sions used are libellous. Sometimes he feels
a wild longing to take a brick along to Clat-
ters’ office and throw it through the window.
But he can’t make up his mind about that
either.
And meanwhile he eyes the postman with
suspicion, for he fears that that innocent
official may one day thrust into his hand
another sharp letter from Clatter asking why
In' doesn’t get on with his work.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BACK from the street across a little
garden lay the half-built cottage, with
some hoopiron hanging from the brick
walls ready for a couple of front rooms at
some future date. The door opened into the
sitting-room, which was very clean and
showed some display. Two crockery dogs
stood on the table on either side of a big
brass-bound book, which rested on a woolly
mat. Facing the door from the wall the
Tvaiser glared above belligerent moustaches.
A pink-and-white faced woman with very
smooth, flaxen hair worked busily at the
sewing machine, and was so absorbed that
she gave a start when the door was darkened
by the figure of a man who carried a small
handbag. She composed her features,
assumed a steely critical expression of eye,
and approached the door stiffly, with slow,
composed step.
“Veil, vot you vant?” she asked severely.
“Are you Mrs. Zweilach?”
“Yah.” with a snap of her lips.
“I’m the water rates man.”
“Oh!” she said without softening. She
looked him up and down a time, and then
stepped back. “You gan gome in.”
lie came in and stood awhile. She gave
him another searching glance.
“Sit.” she said simply.
He sat.
Then she slowly and with great com-
posure found the necessary papers and
money and gave them to him. While he
wrote she watched him as if she was still
not quite sure that he was not a wolf in
•sheep’s clothing. When lie handed her the
receipt she relaxed somewhat.
“Have a gup of dea?” she asked.
“If it is not much trouble.” lie said. “It
is awfully hot outside.” lie added.
“No drouble,” she said.
Neither it was, as she had been preparing
one for herself, and it only needed filling the
teapot from the boiling kettle in the next
room. She watched him drink without fill-
ing her own cup.
“I dought me you vas von of dose mans
who vants to dalk mit me,” she said at
length
“Oh. you have men who want to talk to
you?” he said.
“Yah,” she said.
Then there was a silence, the man blowing
hard at some tea he had poured in the
saucer.
"Ven I buy me dis house I did not know
dat there vas so many mans who vants to
dalk mit me, or I vould not buy der house.
"They trouble you?”
“It is not so much of de drouble, but I am
a respectable vomans who have been married
dree times, undt I dinks me that dere vill be
drouble for some of dose mans pefore long.
All I vants is to be left alone, me undt my
leedle Villum. who go to school undt is in
bis dird standard.”
“Maybe those men have honest intentions,
ma’am.”
“Undt vy dey gome at night ven I go to
mein bed?”
“Do they come at night?”
“Yah. I go to mein bed at eight some-
dimes. Von night dere gome a knock, undt
I say, ‘Who vas dere?’ Undt a man’s voice
he say: ‘lt is only me, Mrs. Zweilach.’
‘Undt who is me?’ I say. He say: ‘lm
Yolin Yackson.’ I say: ‘I don’t know you,
Yolin Yackson.’ ‘l’m from der shop,’ he say.
‘Veil, vot you vant goming after I go to
mein beds undt put mein lights out?’ I ask.
He say, ‘Oh, I yust gome to dalk mit you.
I dinks you must be lonely.’ ‘Oh,’ I say,
‘you only gome to dalk mit me. undt you
dinks I must be lonely?’ Undt he say:
‘Yah.’ Undt I say: ‘Yolin Yackson, I know
you not me, but if you vants to dalk, I opens
mein door undt I ledt out mein dog, undt
he dalks mit you, undt then I poind mein
revolver at you undt I shoots you. Yolin
Yackson, undt you never dalks any more.
Now go, Yolin Yackson, undt be kervig.’
Ur.dt Yolin Yackson go.”
“I don’t wonder,” said the rates man,
la ugliing.
“No, I no vonder too,” said Mrs. Zweilach
grimly. “Dey gome by day too, all sorts of
mans. Some from der pub on der corner.
Dey say : ‘Give me a drink of vater.’ Veil.
T gives dem der vater. but dey no go. I say.
‘Vot you vants now?’ ‘I vants to dalk.’ he
say. ‘You must be lonely,’ he say. I say,
‘lf you don’t go I gives you more vater to
dring—a bucketfull all over you.’ Undt
lie go. Somedimes he vants a match—undt
dalk; somedimes he ask vliere somebody live
—undt dalk ; but I fell ’em vot dey vant.
undt den I put mein do<r on ’em.”
“They must admire you.” said the rates
man.
“I dinks me it vas the vomans who lived
here pefore I buy der house. I dinks me
she vas no good. Perhabs you know?” she
asked.
“Oh. I know nothing about the people I
call on, and besides. I’m new in this dis-
trict.”
“Oh,” she said, and after some thought:
“You see, I’m respegtable vomans, undt I
bring mein Villum up respegtable doo. I’m
only poor vomans. but nobody gan say dot
I’m not respegtable. Mein dree hosbings
vere all respegtable mans, undt vork, egcept

He vas ridcli. undt clinks me ven I marry

“An annuity?”
“Yah. An annuity. Dot so. He die six

Frank vas his child. Frank who vorks at

“Der farder of my leedle Villum he a Ger-

to me: ‘Give me two hundred pounds, Gret-

Villum is ein baby. So. Then he say, You

ven leedle Villum schlape. It is early for der
drain, undt I vants to go back to Villum, but
he drow his arms roundt me undt he cry.
I say. ‘Vliy you cry, Villum? You go away

ings. Undt I see Villum no more. He no

“You have given up hope now?” interro-
gated the rates man.
“No. I still liobe. Some day Vilium gome

gome I dinks me it is drue, but ven two mans
gome I misdoubt me, undt ven dree mans

“Donaldson?” asked the rates man, bewil-
dered.
“Donaldson vorks on der railway. He first,
gome undt I make him flannel shirts, undt I
do his vashing. undt he very good mans to
me. Undt den he vants to marry mit me.
undt I tole him of Villum. But he say Villum

marry mit him. undt I get to love Donaldson ;
undt I sav. ‘lf Villum die I vould marry
mit you !’ ”
“Oh. I s°e. You think he sent those three
men to tell you that William died at Kal-
goorlie?”
“Yah. dot is so.”
“But I don’t see why you should not marry
Donaldson after all these years?”
“No. no.” she said, shaking her head. “Undt
I dinks me Donaldson gome not back again.
He go avay dree monds ago, undt he not

Then she rose and stood by the door as a
signal that the conversation was ended.

REPEATING rifles are in universal use. There
is now, also, a strong and evergrowing de-
mand for repeating shotguns.
The advantages and conveniences in favor
of a repeating shotgun are the same as those
of a repeating rifle. A hunter frequently
finds himself in a position where he is
exceedingly glad if he is able to use
six shots consecutively without re-
loading. If you have never tried
a repeating shotgun, ask your
dealer to show you a Reming-
ton slide action gun. It has
many very important
and exclusive features.
Examine it carefully.
It is well made
and its mechani-
cal act i o n is
absolutely
perfect.
The Rem-
ington repeat-
ing gun is a six-
shot repeater and
possesses the features
that have made Rem-
ington arms famous. It
has a solid breech , and is ham-
merless. The barrel can be
easily and quickly detached with
the fingers for cleaning or carrying,
and quickly replaced. The empty cart-
ridges are ejected from the bottom of the
breech. It is the only bottom ejection repeater
made. The safety” is conveniently placed on
the trigger guard in front of the trigger. If you
are in the market for a gun, the Remington repeater
demands your attention and will merit your approval.
See your dealer or send to
us for full information.

there is no proprietary preparation which has achieved such an enormous success
as Beecham's Pills. And it is worthy of note that their remarkable popularity
is not confined to one class of people nor to one country -their splendid reputation
is world-wide. The explanation of this extraordinary success lies in the fact that
Beecham's Pills always do good. They are specially prepared for dealing with
disorders of the digestive organs, and the relief they afford is both speedy and
sure. Whether the trouble is due to sluggish liver and constipation or an
enfeebled state of the stomach, an intelligent use of
B«edian’s pills
will soon correct the faulty conditions. By gently eliminating all unhealthy
accumulations, and stimulating the stomach to normal efficiency, a great im-
provement in the general health is quickly brought about. The appetite
improves —discomfort after meals disappears and there is no more flatulence or
biliousness. A box of Beecham's Pills is an excellent investment. It pays to
take them. A trial is all that is necessary to convince anyone that as a cure for,
and safeguard against, digestive ailments, Beecham’s Pills

The
Importance
Of
Efficient
Insulation!
The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance, is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test, and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Xewall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail yon along with samples.
