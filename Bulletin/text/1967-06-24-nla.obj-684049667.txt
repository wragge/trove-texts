Who put the Renault 10 in the Australian scene?
One imagines a very clever and very French
designer. But for the love of Mike don’t forget
the boys in the Victorian plant at West Heidel-
berg who add that certain something that makes
you feel like the Man from Snowy River when
you get behind the wheel.

‘Urban Man’
in aluminium by sculptor lan Bow.
‘Frontispiece for Ford Fairlane’
in aluminium by Alcoa.
The grille of a modern car is usually sculptural.
Its form can suggest strength, grace, dignity,
or power. And a natural medium for the
creation of such a form is Alcoa aluminium.
It’s such a versatile metal, with an infinite
variety of types and tempers. It can be cast,
rolled, extruded, drawn, forged, stamped or
spun—riveted, brazed, welded or bonded. It is
practical and decorative. There are limitless
applications for this extraordinary metal.
Unlike the usual sculptural forms, the Alcoa
aluminium grille and side mouldings on the
new Fairlane don’t stand around on a pedestal
They have to withstand a tremendous amount
of wear and weather. So, the metal in these
exterior trims must be of exceptional quality.
For the side mouldings, Alcoa produced the
rigidly controlled aluminium alloy 5457 —H 25
temper, the first time this quality alloy
has been made in Australia.
But generally, standing up to rough treatment
is no problem to aluminium. It is light, strong,
and naturally resistant to corrosion.
Alcoa aluminium is a superior metal to work
with. Ford has takenadvantage of its versatility.

A poser: what to do
with a million
dead marines?
FRANKLY, I WISH I could discuss
the whole sad problem with our old
Bottle-oh. He used to wear a splendid
huckaback waistcoat with* red buttons.
He had a white cavalry moustache and
a superb slouch hat. His tips for the
races were unerring. Furthermore, from
the Bottle-oh one could always get a
report on the economy, similar in
accuracy to the Dow average and per-
haps rather better than those solemn
prognostications that come from the
banks. The Bottle-oh would look over
the percentage of bottles of fine scotch
that were in-coming, whether Toorak
was drinking Chateau Lafite or Wyn-
vale flagons, Gordons or Vickers. Then
he would say, “There was a lot of
Dimple Haig last week. I would say
the economy is on the upsurge. We can
look forward to the coming financial
year with considerable optimism.”
But, alas, we haven’t seen our Bottle-
oh for seven years. They’re a dying race.
There wouldn’t be half a dozen left in
Melbourne. Mr. C. R. Tucker, secre-
tary of the Bottle Merchants’ Associ-
ation, has a bottleyard at Abbotsford.
He says most of his bottles, these times,
come from direct pick-ups. That is, he
sends out a truck in response to a
call. If you want to call for a truck
you must have a minimum of 24 dozen
in your backyard. And he says it is
unbelievable the number of people
who have no trouble at all in collect-
ing 24 dozen empty Fosters bottles.
Sometimes you get 100 dozen.
Then, of course, there are the bottle
drives. In the vast, desert-like dry area
of Camberwell, bottle drives have
turned out as many as 30,000 bottles.
The Boy Scouts are particularly en-
thusiastic about this. One time there
was even a note popped into a carton
at our local licensed grocer which
read: “If the bottles become an embar-
rassment to you, we will arrange to
pick them up promptly. The Metho-
dist Boy Scouts want your bottles to
pay for their new hall.”
As soon as we knew we had a fine
objective like helping the Methodists,
We set about emptying those bottles
as quickly as possible. It gave a noble,
decent purpose to our drinking.
The garbage men also are in it, com-
pletely. The garbage men also are
jealous. They notice all too quickly if
you leave your bottles for the Boy
Scouts. If you love your garbage tin,
leave your bottles for the garbage men.
It is extremely difficult to discover
how well the garbage boys do out of
this. I can only tender the evidence
that one garbage man in our district
went to England for the summer
aboard the Canberra.
A Brisbane bottle merchant has
claimed garbage men make $3O a week,
if energetic. Here the topic is very
secret. A Preston garbage man was
quoted in the “Herald” as saying:
“Don’t print anything about it, the
lads won’t like it a bit.” Ah, but the
cunning “Herald” reporter worked out
that a truck collects from 500 houses
a day. And if it gets an average of two
bottles from each, the return at eight
cents a dozen would be $6.64.
But don’t you see what I’m leading
up to? All this richness is threatened
by the “no return” bottle. Until now,
everybody has owned a bottle some
time. Good things came in glass, but
nearly always the bottle was not your
property. The bottle invariably be-
longed to the bottle company, and you
could be liable for prosecution for ill
use.
For example, if you made a charm-
ing border of beer bottles around your
rosebed you were committing an
offence.
We were told the average milk bottle
made 45 to 50 trips, the soft-drink
bottle 25 to 30, and the beer bottle
was treated with greatest contempt. It
averaged only seven.
The terrible fear is that the “no
return” bottle will eventually ruin the
garbage men and their trips to
Europe and ruin the Methodist Boy
Scouts. The soft-drink makers claim
they were pushed into the change by
the supermarkets and confectioners,
who couldn’t be bothered with the un-
tidy trade of deposit bottles.
For six months there were skirmishes
and border raids between the bottle
merchants and the bottle - makers.
However, late last month, the Bottle
“I take it, ump, you are opposed to
throw-away bottles!”
Merchants’ Association declared it
would no longer accept the throw-away
bottles.
This was the closing of the Gulf of
Aqaba and war was declared.
It was pretty hard to get reliable
figures on the fearful future, but your
correspondent paid a call on Mr. C. R.
Tucker out at Abbotsford. One gathered
there were about 75 firms around Aus-
tralia that were using non-returnable
bottles. What would happen if they
continued to pile up, undestroyed,
mounting, mounting.
Mr. Tucker pulled out some trade
journals. He said that in 1970 Aus-
tralia would be producing, at a mini-
mum, 160 million throw-away lOoz.
bottles. This figure would go up at a
rate of seven percent a year.
A little work on a computer revealed
that by 1980 the figure would be
314,744,213. Or how about the grand
total for ten years, rejected by the
bottle merchants, uncollected by the
Methodist Boy Scouts, of 2,525,375,881.
It was part of Mr. Tucker’s campaign
to give warnings on TV, to circularise
the Municipal Association, to caution
all the bayside councils. One had a
mental picture of the Hume Highway,
a 600-mile tunnel through bottles, the
trees no longer visible to the human
eye, only the sun glinting on the barren
Coca Cola and Schweppervescence.
There were bitter letters to the news-
papers, on the bottle crisis. R. Jame-
son, of Rye, wrote: “If reports about
the likely numbers of bottles are
accurate the Mornington Peninsula is
going to look like something out of an
H. G. Wells horror film at Christmas
holiday time. Our only hope of survival,
if nothing is done in the meantime, is
for a spell of cold, unseasonable
weather.”
The glass manufacturers say they
have been misrepresented. The figures
put out by the bottle merchants
are far too high and the throw-away
bottle is still a luxury item. Further-
more, the bottles are not cluttering the
beaches and they do actually buy them
back for cullet, that is for melting
down, a necessary part of their opera-
tion. According to Australian glass
manufacturers they were buying back
this cullet for $2.50 a ton, and now
they are offering $8 a ton, collected.
At the time of going to press, media-
tion was still going on. Not an inch
of desert, not one dead marine was
being conceded by either party. One
interesting solution, however, had been
pointed out. At Queenstown, in New
Zealand, there is a house which has
been built entirely out of empty bottles
and it is quite a showpiece. Also, a
gentleman at Ceduna, in Western Aus-
tralia, has been doing something
similar. Could this be the answer?
Your correspondent says “No.” The
no-return bottles are made of thin-
walled glass, and are, therefore, second
rate. Surely any decent, red-blooded
Melburnian would want to build his
house out of the best Fosters blue label
export empties.

Creative demands
of thinking mink
round the clock
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
MAX CORNELIUS’ front girl sits
alongside a heap of koalas and
kangaroo purses and things. Can she
help? She passes the information to a
senior sitting six inches behind her, who
says what was the name, and everyone
stares while it’s all explained again. She
double-checks on the telephone and,
after slight hesitation at Utility Furs,
a seat is offered in Minks.
Utility Furs are doing some good
trade today. It is sale-time and the place
is teeming with Mums buying bargains.
In Minks a lone customer checks the
color of a jacket collar against her com-
plexion. It’s not the style she wants,
you understand, it’s the color she’s after.
The assistant likes that. “The color of
the collar” she trills and giggles. Isn’t
that cute? Some elderly teenagers are
going mad in Fun Furs. God knows
that makes me fat, Elsie. Well, for
Gawd’s sake try stripes the other way,
then.
Mr. Cornelius —Max to his higher
income-bracket customers < — emerges
from behind a rail of cape stoles. When
he won the Emba Cup for furs in
Frankfurt (it makes him a sort of Rolls-
Royce of the fur crowd) he had to
pinch himself hard. But now he’s got
over the excitement of it all. Pooh to
Certificates of Merit, he’s acquired the
taste for Cups. What he wants now is
a long line of Emba cups, lots and lots
of them all over the place, and that
means work.
Here he is, then, the man who has
projected this luxury image of Aus-
tralia, a short, tubby fellow bristling
with ball-point pens and specs, grey-
suited, his trousers yanked in with a
stomach-cleaving leather belt . . . Er,
what magazine was it? The thing is,
everyone’s been after him since the
Emba award. He’s got Andrea at 2.30
as well. Mr. Cornelius is a bit worried
about Andrea. He doesn’t find her too
easy to talk to. However. When the sale
is over he is putting the Emba cup in
the window and arranging a nice little
mink display around it.
We’re in his office, sitting on brass,
ocelot-covered cjiairs. A black-and-
gold pendulum clock swings over

MILDEST CIGAR ON THE

Manila cigars, Havana, Jamaican,
American, Dutch, Continental cigars
. . they all have their good points.
Combine all those good points and
what have you got? Statesman —a
superior cigar mildest on the
international scene.
Qantas’ 1967 calendar and every so
often an employee rushes in, stops dead
j n her tracks and backs out, petrified.
Ifiax Cornelius is a creative man, and
w orks 24 hours a day. He has a little
studio in his mind, he says, and when
a brilliant idea comes, works on it there
and then. Like the time he was playing
ping-pong and began sketching all
round the net. They’ve had to put a
glass top on the dining-table so he can
draw without ruining the linen.
His new thing is riveting furs together
w ith metal links. No, it doesn’t give
furs a longer life, but it does mean
all those scraps he wasted can now be
used.
Mrs. Cornelius enters, throws on her
Fisher (from the lesser end of the
sable family) coat, says she’s having
lunch on a banana and has left instruc-
tions he’s not to be disturbed. Out-
side a rich young lady tries on her
third mink hat, she hasn’t got one at
all; Max, isn’t it dreadful? Ah, well,
it won’t be long before her fur ward-
robe is complete. She can’t possibly
exist without six or seven necessary
pieces i.e., an ocelot coat costing
$2OOO to $2500, a mink coat $2OOO to
$4OOO, a broadtail coat $2OOO to $3OOO,
plus a jacket, a cape stole, and some
cravats and ties. She doesn’t, after all,
want to get bored with her collection.
Actually, when Max Cornelius goes
shopping for fur he always has some
customer in mind well, for instance,
there’s a lady who’s been wanting black
sables for ages, but she’ll have to wait
a bit longer till July’s fur sale in Lenin-
grad. He hasn’t seen anything yet
nearly good enough.
Sydney, in fact, accounts for 75 per-
cent of his trade. 'The rest is export
and tourists and visitors. Winifred
Atwell, for example, Vivien Leigh, and
there was Killer Kowalski, who’s just
had a very, very big kangaroo coat
made. Zara Holt took one of his mink
coats for Ladybird Johnson and but
no, no more about that. Who knows?
One day, one day, perhaps, “Furrier by
Appointment to . . .” Well, anyone,
may be over the door.
Meanwhile, Mr. Cornelius’ hundred
employees toil away at next season’s
furry surprises, including, for heaven’s
sake, bright blue, red, and green seal-
skin. Or is it poor old pony? The rich,
you know, have their furs tested out on
cheap furs first, so their end product
is exquisite. There’s more than the
insured $lOO,OOO worth of pelts stored
down in the basement. Who could steal
even that amount? Furs are so fat. Max
Cornelius strokes all the skins in turn.
Ahhhh. He could tell ermine with his
eyes closed. What? An employee sticks
his head round Broadtails and says the
wan who does Rabbits is here and
wants to see him. What about? About
two reels of cotton. Mr. Cornelius
groans. Everyone wants Max.
Afterwards he took it all back about
Andrea. She was easy to talk to . . . er,
with.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Glorious old
English pudding
A VERY good friend once asked us
to dinner, and prepared three sumptu-
ous courses. Each one was excellent.
There was only one problem: the
first course contained sour cream, the
second a sauce prepared with fresh
cream, the third was topped with
whipped cream.
Not only substances, but textures and
colors, like flavors, must vary. If you
start a meal with a cheese souffle,
don’t finish it off with a fruit mousse.
If your piece de resistance is a steamed
pudding, make the entree little and
good, the main course light and
delicious, and your pud will come into
rv.»,n
its own.
rr., r- t i , . ,
The Enghsh pudding glonous and
sustaining—and frankly based on suet
-is out of favor these days, with so
much concentration on calories and
heait diseases. But now that winter is
here I’m permitting myself the indul-
gence of thinking about Castle Pud-
dings, Spotted Dog, Roly-Poly, Canary
and Marble Puddings with jam sauce.
Here are some puddings to delight
the gluttonous and, as it happens, they
have no suet. Guards Pudding can be
served with a sauce made with 2 eggs
and an extra yolk, ljoz. castor sugar,
and pint of sweet wine. Whisk to-
gether in the top of a double boiler
until thick and foamy.
To prepare pudding, mix 1 cup of
white breadcrumbs with f cup of sugar
and f cup of butter. Add a pinch of
baking soda dissolved in 1 teaspoon
of water. Beat 3 eggs thoroughly and
add 6 tablespoons of raspberry jam.
Mix everything together vigorously.
Grease pudding bowl and place mix-
ture in it. Steam for 2 hours.
My husband is a sucker for Treacle
Sponge , which is very quick and easy
to prepare. Mix together 2 tablespoons
of treacle, the juice of half a lemon,
and 1 tablespoon of fine white bread-
crumbs. Place the mixture in the
bottom of a buttered pudding basin.
Then cream 4oz. butter with the finely
grated rind of a lemon and 4oz. of
sugar. When fluffy and light, add 2
well-beaten eggs. Stir in soz. self-
raising flour, sifted with a pinch of salt,
and add just enough milk for the batter
to drop from a spoon. Add to con-
tents of pudding basin, cover, and
steam for 2 hours. Serve with more
treacle warmed with a tablespoon of
lemon juice.
Paradise Pudding entails a little more
work, but is well worth the effort
You’ll need 6 eggs, 6 apples, 6oz
breadcrumbs, 6oz. sugar, 1 gl ass
brandy, peel of £ lemon, £ teaspoon
of salt, and a dash of nutmeg,
p ee l and cube apples. Mix with
sugar an d breadcrumbs. Add lemon
pee l an d nutmeg. Beat the eggs add
them, then stir in the brandy. Butter
yoU r mould or pudding bowl, put i n
the mixture, tie a cloth firmly over
the top with string, and boil in a large
covered saucepan for 3 hours. Serve
with wine sauce,
Hungarian Plum Dumplings are
superb—but once again they are filling
an d can only be served after a light
meal. Roast six mealy potatoes until
cooked. Rub through a sieve. Add
2oz. butter, 3 eggs, a pinch of salt, and
as muc h flour as the mixture will’hold
without becoming gooey. Roll the
dough to fin. thickness and cut into
squares big enough to hold a stoned
plum. (When out of season use a
stoned dessert prune soaked for an hour
Q r so in brandy.) Fold over plum,
pat j nto a kMi, sprinkle with sugar and
cinnamon, drop into boiling water
j , /-p> r • . . ’
and cook. Dumplings rise in the
,f A .
saucepan when done.) Dram on
absorbent paper. When they are all
cooked . roll them in breadcrumbs
tbat bave bee n browned in butter, and
dust with sugar and cinnamon. Serve
while very hot . . . and then go for a
long walk!

ON THE
MARGIN
The strange case
of the uxorious
millionaire
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
ONE OF THE perennial themes of
American journalism is the eccentricity
of Howard Hughes. For years this very
rich man has shunned publicity with a
determination that his compatriots find
baffling. We have all read from time
to time odd details of his secluded life.
He has been known to convey instruc-
tions to employees by means of a basket
lowered from an upper window. He is
apt to buy hotels to ensure that his
privacy will not be disturbed while he
is staying there.
His absolute refusal to communicate
with the Press has aroused inevitable
antagonism from that quarter. The time
is past when Mr. Hughes’ aloofness was
regarded as a mere quaint foible. Refer-
ences to it now carry the scarcely
veiled implication that he is disloyal to
the American way of life.
I must say that in the course he has
chosen Mr. Hughes has my support,
although there can be few living per-
sons less in need of it. Here is a man
who simply wants to be left alone. It
happens that he has sufficient means to
attain this objective, even though it
involves constant travel by private air-
craft to secret destinations. Some might
regard the inconvenience Mr. Hughes
suffers in avoiding the public gaze as
even greater than that which he would
incur by submitting to it. But if that is
the way he prefers to live, he has a right
to do so.
What stiri'ed me to this manifesto in
support of Howard Hughes was the
latest account of his unsociable exist-
ence. After listing the usual eremitic
details, the writer gave a crowning
illustration of the millionaire’s bizarre
nonconformity: “Mr. Hughes’ only in-
timate companion is his wife, the former
movie actress Jean Peters.”
The resentment behind the words was
plainly discernible. The writer, doubt-
less impecunious and discontented with
his own marital situation, was con-
fronted with this man of boundless
wealth, who could afford as many inti-
mate companions as he wished. Yet Mr
Hughes had voluntarily restricted him-
self to the sole company of his wife of
all people. By so doing he was not only
depriving the Press of its rightful supply
of material; he was in some way offer-
ing an insult to the American Dream
It is my opinion, on the contrary
that instead of deriding Mr. Hughes’
preference for his wife’s company we
should give it sympathetic considera-
tion. It is a symptom of a developing
social trend. Slowly but perceptibly the
potentialities of wives as companions
are becoming recognised. A straw in the
wind was the English television pro-
gram —discussed here some weeks ago—
in which mistresses complained that
they were neglected by lovers who paid
too much attention to their wives. Even
in Australia, where men traditionally
prefer the company of their own sex,
some have begun to spend regular
evenings at home.
The growing prestige of wives is
connected with a steady improvement
in their social accomplishments. Pre-
sumably the former movie actress Jean
Peters is able to converse fluently on
the subjects that interest Mr. Hughes,
or at least to listen intelligently to what
he says. Likewise many Australian
wives have learned to talk in a well-
informed w 7 ay about football, motor-
cars, and other topics of importance
to their husbands.
The road toward acceptance of wives
as companions is not an easy one for
them. They have suffered from bad
public relations for a long time. One
could cite such evidence as the dispar-
aging lines of Swinburne:
Time turns the old days to derision,
Our loves into corpses or wives.
All the more reason why they should
be encouraged to learn that a man of
Howard Hughes’ eminence in the busi-
ness world has selected his wife as his
only intimate companion.
Some wives, it is true, may not relish
the prospect of increased intimacy. A
Mrs. D., of Sydney, told me frankly
she was appalled at the thought of her
husband staying away from the RSL
and spending his leisure at home with
her. But many other women envy the
conjugal attention lavished on former
movie actress Jean Peters.
Mr. Hughes’ example, when it be-
comes more widely known, could have
considerable influence on husbands.
There are many businessmen whose sec-
retaries do not understand them. They
might, if they tried, find a needed emo-
tional outlet by making a closer
acquaintance with their wives and con-
fiding in them. If the wife proved re-
sponsive, a man could perhaps arrange
to go off somewhere for a quiet week-
end with her. There would be no need
for his friends to know what was going
on.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES ON
THE
ECONOMY
Australia's sterling
problem and
the Middle East
IT HAS MADE our sterling holdings
look pretty sick again. That is probably
the most important of the economic
implications for Australia of the Israel-
Arab war; it will probably be more im-
portant to us than the temporary clos-
ing of the Suez Canal, which so far
looks like adding about $1 million or
so to Australia’s freight bills. There are
other problems, too, like the war’s im-
pact on Australia’s direct and growing
export trade with the Middle East, our
investments in the area, and our future
oil-buying policy (and the policies of
companies searching for oil in Austra-
lia).
The freight facts are open to a lot
of argument, with a fair amount of
evidence being presented to suggest that
the five percent surcharge now being
placed on all shipping freights between
Australia and Europe is a bit hot.
Nevertheless, the three days’ extra
steaming involved in going round the
Cape in a voyage of 28 days or so,
now that the Suez canal is blocked,
certainly adds more than five percent
distance and time on to the journey. In
any event, if it is to take two months
at least to clear the canal, the total
cost in added freights in Australia’s ex-
port trade, at an extra $150,000 a week,
will probably reach at least $1.2 mil-
lion. And for all Egypt’s angry com-
ments, the Egyptians need the canal
revenues even more than European
shipping lines need the canal.
But there is no doubt that Australia’s
$4O million-a-year export trade with
the Middle East is in for trouble.
Egypt, for example, is certain to face
another period of economic mess after
her defeat, so last year’s Australian ex-
ports, that had been built up by some
fairly energetic trading to SBJ million,
seem likely to suffer.
It is not just Egypt, but all the Arab
countries involved in the war (apart
from the oil skeikdoms) who will find
that shortages of cash might limit their
buying of the wheat, mutton, and motor
vehicles that make up the bulk of our
Middle Eastern trade. Australia does not
have much investment in the area.
Egypt is our biggest single customer
there, although we hardly buy anything
from Egypt. But the next two in im-
portance are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
which together buy million as the
other side to an exchange transaction
in which we buy $75 million-worth of
oil. Then follows Lebanon with $2.3
million (and hardly any return sales),
Bahrein with $1.3 million (about the
same as the oil it sells to Australia),
and Israel about $1.3 million, or about
$400,000 less than we buy.
The oil implications of the war are
that, apart from encouraging Australian
oil companies to buy less from the
Middle East and more from the now-
friendly Indonesia, an upset Middle
East (and threats of supply boycotts)
always encourages international oil
groups to hurry up the search for com-
mercial fields in more stable parts of
the world and Australia is just such
a place. It would be natural to expect
the pace of overseas spending in Aus-
tralia’s oil search to go ahead even
faster now - quite apart from the
stimulus given by the remarkable off-
shore discoveries of recent times.
But the sterling problem is by far
the greatest that has emerged from
Israel’s triumph. British commentators
have underlined the extent of Britain’s
humiliation in not being able to take
any real position to support Israel be-
cause of the vital £6OO million that the
Arab countries (mainly the oil ex-
porters) hold in sterling balances.
Whether or not Britain’s freedom of
diplomatic action was inhibited by its
fears of what the Arabs would do to
sterling is not only Britain’s problem.
While we hold so much sterling, it is
also ours. True, it was hardly likely
that Australia’s official attitudes to the
war were influenced very greatly by
the threat it posed to the strength of
our reserves. But it could have threat-
ened them. And what if the war had
gone the other way?
The Arab threat to sterling is simple:
if the Arabs got angry enough about
Britain’s sympathetic attitudes to Israel,
they could move (or even threaten to
move) their international reserves into
some other currency, so reducing by
£6OO million the funds backing the
pound sterling, and making it look a
risky currency once again, prompting
a run on it and possibly forcing a de-
valuation.
When the Arab-Israel war began,
there was, in fact, a great deal of
nervousness about sterling; many inter-
national holders of sterling did sell their
securities and move the cash to other
countries just to be on the safe side, and
the price of sterling slipped. The Bank
of England had to move into the mar-
ket to protect the pound again
and all this despite the fact that Brit-
ain’s economic position was a lot
healthier than in last year’s sterling
crisis, and that the currency had been
looking quite strong.
It is not good enough to ignore the
Arab threat to sterling (if there is such
a unified thing) by asking the rhetorical
question: where else could they put
their money and then answering it with
“nowhere.” It is true that switching
into dollars would be untenable for the
Arabs in the circumstances of the Arab-
Israel war, and other currencies like
Swiss francs do not return any income
on these huge cash resources that would
be switched. It would take a very angry
lot of Arabs indeed to rob themselves
of the income from so much cash; m
Britain it would pTobably be earning
something like £3O million a year.
Nevertheless, it is possible for people to
get £3O million angry.
There can be no doubt that the
quick, tidy Israeli victory has made it
vital that something should be done
about sterling. Most of our international
reserves are still in London, even though
we are doing most of our international
trading with non-sterling countries. The
problems set for sterling by the war
have certainly added great weight to
objections about so much (about two-
thirds) of Australia’s overseas reserves
being in sterling. But this old question
of whether to move out of sterling into
other currencies may well be solved for
us if Britain goes into Europe
For the world’s uneasiness about
sterling, brought on by the war, demon-
strated the recent strong objection made
by President de Gaulle when dismissing
the prospects of Britain’s early entry
into the EEC. He insisted that Britain
would have to give up sterling’s role
as an international currency because
he did not want a weak currency com-
ing into Europe. He obviously thinks
the pound should be devalued as well
as decimated. And with the usual yearly
question mark soon to hang over sterl-
ing in the months before the September
meeting of the International Monetary
Fund (as speculators get nervous that
sterling could be in for the chopper, or
the price of gold could rise at the Fund
meeting), some European commentators
are now taking the view that it is a
matter of “when” rather than “if” on
devaluation particularly if Britain
continues her attempts to join the
Common Market.
The answer may lie in creating two
different kinds of sterling, one for
Britain’s own use, and another for inter-
national currency dealing. But, what-
ever is done, the Arab-Israel war has
demonstrated once again that holding
so much of our international reserves in
sterling is a risky proposition, even on
those occasions when the British balance
of payments is looking healthy.
Is it a risk we ought to take?


ONE MORE
WEEK
Talking big
THE ARAB-ISRAEL war, short and
sharp as it was, seemed to take many
of us back into the past. The very
words, Middle East, incongruous them-
selves in today’s world, set off a chain
reaction. Soon the commentators were
talking about the Great Powers; for
a short time, the British, busy trying
to scramble into Europe and to with-
draw from East of Suez, suddenly and
comically began to act as a Great
Power, or, rather, as Mr. Wilson
thought he remembered Great Powers
acting.
Next, commentators were talking
about Big Three Summit meetings. A
correspondent in “The Australian” a
few days ago was offering a choice of
either a Big Three Summit meeting or
a Big Four Summit meeting, without,
wisely, specifying who the Big Three or
the Big Four might be.
Sinderella and the Censor
ACCORDING to Phillip Adams, the
censor, breathing heavily, pruned a
number of Melbourne Film Festival
entries. A climax in “The Climax”
was trimmed, and ten salacious frames
less than half a second were
lopped from a love scene in “Love 65.”
The one British feature “The Private
Right” was withdrawn by the direc-
tor when threatened with cuts and
Japan’s “The Amorist” was banned out-
right. _
As is generally known, Australia is
the only country which censors Festival
films at all. The sort of split-level cen-
sorship the Festival people propose
may be a useful first step in a modifica-
tion of censorship generally, but it does
have problems. As Phillip Adams points
out, a Festival ticket is not proof of ad-
vanced intellectualism, wholesomeness,
or maturity. On the basis of foyer dis-
cussions on which one perforce
eavesdrops, some Festival members
would lose equilibrium on exposure to
“Mary Poppins.”
However, while the censor was busy
with Festival films, the Star Thea-
trette was free to show “Sinderella and
the Golden Bra.”
Smile, please
WHILE DOCTORS continue to show
a lofty contempt for public relations,
the dental profession makes full use of
lt , although with somewhat mixed re-
mits. The N.S.W. Dental Health,
Education and Research Foundation,
now five years old, has already this
year conducted a shaggy toothbrush
competition, set up a Dental Brain
computer at the Sydney Royal Easter
Show, and established a marionette
theatre to tour schools with a dental
health message.
As well, the foundation is carrying
out a number of projects in association
with either the University of Sydney
or the University of N.S.W. One is to
see if piped music holds the key to
relaxation in the dentist’s chair. Sydney
University psychologists are testing
nervous reaction to music in a Sydney
school clinic.
A few weeks ago the Foundation re-
leased the Martin Report, the results
of its most ambitious project. The re-
sult of four years’ research carried out
under the direction of Professor R. T.
Martin, of the School of Applied Psy-
chology at the University of N.S.W.,
the report placed the blame for poor
dentist-patient relations squarely on the
dentist. Although dentists valued public
relations highly enough to pledge
$204,000 to establish the Foundation,
they can’t carry out their good inten-
tions in their own surgeries with their
own patients.
An organisation with less spirit than
the Foundation might have been
deterred by the results of one recent
project. Eight months ago the Founda-
tion, together with people from the
universities, chose as a guinea-pig town
Canowindra, 300 miles from Sydney.
For a year, the people of Canowindra
were bombarded with pamphlets, films,
lectures on the subject of dental health.
Another town, Gilgandra, was ear-
marked, too, to be ignored. Then at the
end of it all, a complete dental exam-
ination of schoolchildren in both towns
was carried out. The result: no signi-
ficant difference between the two towns.
Award of the year
SYDNEY HAIRDRESSER Kenneth of
Knightsbridge has just announced his
Client of the Year, who will be awarded
a gem-studded medallion. To compete
for this honor one must be a regular
customer, and, presumably, a prompt-
paying one.
“It mainly depends on how I feel
about the person, if she is interesting to
work on, if I can establish a pleasant
relationship with her,” Kenneth ex-
plained. “Just a nice little gesture,
really.” The recipient of the nice
little gesture is actress Jill Perryman.
When told the news, she laughed and
said how wonderful it all was.
When we discussed his Client of the
Year with Kenneth, he was waiting for
another actress client, Laya Raki. He
was wearing a Cardin-designed polka-
dotted tie with handkerchief to match
in her honor, but she was half an hour
late already. “She likes her hair done
in a casual, just-out-of-bed style,” he
explained. “No one else in Sydney can
do it for her.”
Kenneth Nyland was born in New
Zealand and has been a hairdresser in
Australia for 15 years. In 1962 he was
in London, working for Gordon of
Mayfair, who had Joan Sutherland as
a client. Kenneth gave Joan a bouffant
red head which she liked so much that
she asked him to come with her as
hairdresser on her Australian tour in
1965. Afterwards, he set up a salon
with a theatrical clientele, plus, he says,
“a sprinkling of socialites.”
The walls of his salon are decorated
with signed photographs. “To Kenneth,
a reminder of the wonderful stars you
created and of the tour itself. Affec-
tionately, Joan Sutherland,” says one.
The Lucia room, a curtained enclosure,
is where Sutherland had her hair tinted
in seclusion, and it is now used for
beauty treatments.
Then there is the Knightsbridge
Academy, run by actress Jacqueline
Kott, which takes over the salon at
night and teaches people how to behave
in public. “Little housewives who have
to make speeches at bowling clubs or
fetes —that sort of thing,” Kenneth
explained. “Gives them confidence,
you know.”
Meanwhile, back at the salon, Miss
Raki had rung to say she wouldn’t be
coming; she had gone to her body
masseur instead. Not the way to
become Client of the Year, one would
think.
Lost and found
SOMETIME in the 1930 s what was
believed to be the last representative
of one of Australia’s more attractive
native animals, the white-throated or
parma wallaby (Macropus parma) died.
In the early days of settlement the
parma was plentiful in the scrub
country of the south coast of N.S.W.
Its attractiveness led to its end. Hunted
eagerly by black man and white, its
numbers dwindled rapidly. No attempt
was made in this century to preserve it,
and by the 1930 s all we were left with
were two stuffed specimens in the Aus-
tralian Museum.
Now the parma has been redis-
covered in quantity on the 5000-acre
island of Kawua, some 30 miles north
of Auckland, New Zealand. Ironically,
it is in great danger of becoming “ex-
tinct” again. Wallabies in New Zealand
are like rabbits here, an introduced pest,
and officially proclaimed noxious.
The parma on Kawua was redis-
covered by two New Zealand zoolo-
gists. From skulls and skins sent to
Australia for comparison with museum
specimens identification of the species
has been confirmed.
Kawua Island is privately owned.
Moreover, efforts are now being made
to bring its inhospitable soil into pro-
duction by planting pine forests. Since
the parma nibbles the young trees and
is menacing the success of this venture,
an increasingly heavy attack is being
mounted against it. In another couple
of years the species will be gone for
certain unless Australian conserva-
tionists come to the rescue immediately
and reintroduce it to its ancestral
haunts.


AS I SEE IT
The sorry
disillusionment of
Sir Ali-ck Downer
FROM ALAN REID
Who accompanied the Prime
Minister on his overseas tour
WHEN SIR ALICK DOWNER,
former MHR for the South Australian
seat of Angus, was appointed Australian
High Commissioner in London, there
was mild consternation in the Labor
Opposition. Labor members liked him
personally. But they regarded him as
more British than the British.
They had reason for holding this
view. Downer was Australian born and
bred. His father, a former South Aus-
tralian Premier, was one of the makers
of the Australian Constitution. But he
modelled himself on his concept of
what constituted an English gentleman.
He owned a gem of a property in
South Australia, complete with deler
park and private chapel (the former
South Australian Liberal Premier, Sir
Thomas Playford, as earthy as the well-
tended soil in his orchard, and no
respecter of privilege despite his
Liberal label, drove a road right
through the middle of it, much to the
disgust of Downer who then disposed
of it). He had what Australians con-
sider an English-type politeness. He
had reverence for the royal House of
Windsor, Britain, and British integrity,
and the Commonwealth (or at least the
older white-faced members, such as
Britain herself, Canada, Australia, and
New Zealand). He had an unquestion-
ing belief that just as Australia would,
and should, come loyally to Britain’s
aid in time of crisis, Britain would as
automatically come to our aid.
When Downer was first appointed
it looked as though Labor’s pessimism
that the Australian Government was
installing in London someone who
would be more of an apologist for
British policies than an advocate for
Australian viewpoints might be justi-
fied. Downer acquired a country seat.
He fitted into the London scene like
fingers into a custom-made glove. There
seemed some basis for the view that
he had found his natural habitat and
that the possibility of him returning to
Australia was remote.
In saying that, I am not suggesting
that Downer was starry-eyed to the
point of foolishness. He was raised in
a political household. He had experi-
ence, first as a backbencher and as a
Minister for Immigration. Nobody can
have this kind of background and re-
main ingenuously starry-eyed.
He knew as well as the next man,
probably better, that the British were
tough dealers that on the economic
side they tried to get more than a
quid’s value for a quid’s outlay, just as
Australia understandably always tried
to get more than a dollar’s worth for
a dollar expenditure.
But Downer believed that when the
chips came down, when the issues were
fundamental, Britain would unhesitat-
ingly come to the aid of the Australian
party, despite distance and remoteness,
just as unquestionably as Australia had
lined up with Britain in World War I,
and from the outbreak of World War
II when, with Japan still neutral,
Britain’s problems looked rather distant,
viewed from the Australian shoreline.
As I hear it, Downer is a dis-
illusioned man.
In response to his insistence that a
British presence in South-East Asia was
essential to Australia’s future (a view-
point that he has been advancing for
the past two years on his Government’s
behalf), he has been repeatedly assured
that Britain would continue its presence
in South-East Asia, virtually un-
changed. Not until its occupancy of
bases in Singapore and Malaysia be-
came unwelcome to the local admini-
strations would Britain consider any
change in the setup. Reports to the
contrary notwithstanding, Britain would
support Australia in the area, just as
Australia had supported Britain in
Europe and the Middle East in two
wars. Over recent months, Downer has
discovered that these assurances were
valueless that Britain was consult-
ing its own interests and not ours.
Personally I can both sympathise
Sir Alick and Lady Downer
with the British leaders and understand
their motivations. They have enormous
problems on their hands. They are try-
ing to underpin a shaky economy w ith
resources that nowadays are much more
limited than they were when the
British Empire was in full flower and
a quarter of the world’s map was paint-
ed red. They have serious pockets of
unemployment, rising prices, export
and currency worries.
In its way, Downer’s disillusion-
ment is a pointer to the future.
There will always be an affinity be-
tween Britain and Australia. The con-
tinuance of the British immigration
program ensures this, as well as the
fact that Australians realise that their
origins are mostly in the United King-
dom, whence they draw so much of
their traditions, customs, habits, style
of government, and law. But, as Downer
has found out the painful way,
emotional attachments are shaky foun-
dations on which to build long-term
policies in this hard, modern world.
It is difficult to see Downer, out-
wardly as British as the British, turn-
ing increasingly to the United States
for association, help, and co-operation.
But once Downer and the hundreds
like him in Australia turn their gaze
from the United Kingdom, they have
to look elsewhere. A small nation with
limited resources and of European cul-
ture on the periphery of Asia, Aus-
tralia cannot afford to be inward look-
ing. And the only direction in which it
can gaze and expect a sympathetic
response (and, if necessary, the mili-
tary support which Britain can no
longer give) is to the United States.
To this extent the Prime Minister,
Harold Holt, has anticipated the dis-
illusionment of Downer and his like in
Australia, who are still prone to de-
plore the growing association with the
United States at what they view as
Britain’s expense.
When Holt used his now famous
phrase “All the way with LBJ” he was
merely expressing in a crude form what
an increasing number of Australians
including the erstwhile determinedly
pro-British types like Downer are
recognising as a truism.
This is that an association similar to
that formerly existing between Britain
and Australia has now to be developed
between the United States and Aus-
tralia, if Australia is to have the same
kind of security as it enjoyed (or be-
lieved it enjoyed) when Britannia ruled
the waves and Britain was a major force
in the South-East Asian region.
This is putting it in its simplest form.
Actually Holt has a wider vision than
that. He sees Australia having this kind
of association with the United States
while simultaneously fostering a new
dynamic relationship with the develop-
ing countries of the New Asia.
In its way, the disillusionment of the
Downers of the Australian scene has its
value. It could produce a more realistic
approach to Australia’s problems D
showing them against the issues of the
future instead of past relationships.


AUSTRALIA
No barriers to Arabs as
migrants, but...
AS IT ALL turned out, Australia
emerged from the Middle East war
rather well. Our involvement was only
diplomatic, but despite an unsteady start
(with Hasluck contradicting Holt) the
end result was most successful.
We were able to make all the neces-
sary legal noises about the need to
maintain freedom of the high seas and
indulge our prejudices by quietly cheer-
ing the Israeli success while maintain-
ing relations with the Arabs and avoid-
ing international identification with the
committed Americans and British.
Unlike them, our diplomatic relations
with Arab countries remain unharmed.
But looking back on the affair, the
greatest triumph for Australian diplo-
macy came when Mr. Holt said quite
casually at a Press conference at London
Airport that we would like to help
toward a solution of the problems that
remain and made the off-the-cuff offer
to take Palestinian refugees. By getting
in before any other country with an
offer of resettlement Mr. Holt pulled
off something of a diplomatic coup. He
also indirectly provided very news-
worthy evidence of the liberalisation of
our immigration policies.
Back in Australia, people in govern-
ment were somewhat taken aback by
the Prime Minister’s initiative. De-
partmental officers in Canberra
hastened to point out that for some
time now there have been no Aus-
tralian barriers to the acceptance of
Arabs as migrants. The gradual lower-
ing of barriers against the migration
of “non-Europeans” has been accom-
panied by an outward drift of the
areas regarded as “European.” The
whole of North Africa and the Arab
countries, plus Turkey, are no longer
regarded as “non-European,” and
people from these areas are free to
a Pply to migrate to Australia in the
same way as Europeans.
Officials in practice, of course, have
administered selection policy in this
fnnge-Europe area with great caution
and conservatism so far. As reflected in
one Canberra immigration officer’s
comment: “We don’t reckon Aus-
tralians want too many fellows in night-
shirts or blokes who’d be liable to drop
0n to a prayer-mat in George Street
°n the stroke of six,” an appraisal that
as precluded any positive attempt at
recruiting migrants in Arab countries.
fhe Palestinian refugees are a more
complex matter, since so far the Arab
countries in which they are camped
have resisted all attempts to have them
dispersed. They are standing testimony
to the historical fact that Israel was
created by the displacement of some
of the indigenous population, and
therefore too good a propaganda base
to be eroded by humanitarianism.
But Mr. Holt was looking to an over-
all settlement of the issue when he
offered Australian help to the refugees.
Since the problem arose in 1948, it
has been costing the international com-
munity $5 million a year to support
the refugees, and Australia has pro-
vided a total of $3 million. We are
also committed to continuing annual
payment of $200,000, so there is a
simple financial interest in a solution.
Half the 1,300,000 refugees are in
Jordan, and since this has always been
the least hostile Arab nation the
chances of resettling these people
would seem reasonably good. But it
depends most of all on a general
settlement in the area.
Israel, it is hoped, will use its mili-
tary occupation of Arab territory as
a strong bargaining weapon in the
diplomatic struggle for a settlement.
The role of Australia according to
Canberra officials should be to
exert what influence we can to prevent
a polarisation of political forces. One
suggestion being floated is that we
follow up the Prime Minister’s en-
lightened resettlement offer with a grant
of food aid to the Arabs.
The ALP
Laboring party
EVERYONE IN AUSTRALIA, ex-
cept the lunatic Left, agrees that Mr.
Whitlam has told the Labor Party
exactly what needs to be done. He
hasn’t pulled any punches. But there is
something very symptomatic in the
fact that after having delivered his
blows at State Conferences of the Party,
he immediately rushed off on an over-
seas trip to be photographed with LBJ
and Wilson.
At the State Conferences he did
Gough Whitlam in Washington, with
LBJ and Miss National Printing
prove one thing that he has guts.
His speech to the Victorians got them
shouting and screaming, but it did not
change anything. The votes in Labor
Party conferences are predetermined,
a product mainly of union elections
held long before.
Having made his bold gestures, Mr.
Whitlam is off. He will be back for the
vital Federal Conference in Adelaide
in July, but in a typical manner, he
is leaving left undone the hard pre-
paratory work of getting the numbers
for his reorganisation of the Party. He
should get them. He has NSW and
Tasmania providing 12 out of 36 votes.
The only absolutely solid and im-
movable opposition is in Victoria. He
has six votes firmly against him there,
whatever he wants to do.
He should be able to gather some
votes in Queensland where, despite
ideological antagonisms, he has built
up personal allegiance through his
effective campaigning. He has a chance
of three and possibly four of South
Australia’s votes.
There is plenty of sympathy for his
cause among Western Australian dele-
gates, but Mr. Joe Chamberlain’s
executive has already acted to disci-
pline them to vote according to his
anti-Whitlam dictates. Chamberlain’s
grip on his own Party organisation has
slipped badly during the past year, and
a concerted lobbying effort before the
State Conference on July 7 could swing
things Whitlam’s way by rescinding the
executive instruction to delegates.
That is where Mr. Whitlam should
now be if he wants to make sure of
getting the Federal Conference to sup-
port his plan for reorganisation. With
luck, of course, his followers may suc-
ceed without him and the numbers.
But success in getting approval for
reorganisation of the Party structure
would not ensure Mr. Whitlam of the
control he wants. It would make it
easier since it would increase the
influence of Right Wing New South


Wales, and the strength of branches as
opposed to trade unions. Entrenched
executives in Melbourne, Perth, and
Brisbane would have much more
trouble drumming-up support. But until
he has a coherent team of followers
running through the Party, parallel to
that of the Left, he will not have the
means to cement his position in the new
structure.
The Left, through their unity-ticket
control of trade union jobs, is able to
dominate important union delegations
to Labor Party conferences, and that
won’t be changed by turning the Federal
Conference into a larger convention.
Not unless Mr. Whitlam follows up
with a concerted campaign against what
is called these days, the “coalition of
the Left” the complex inter-
dependence of the Left Wing of the
ALP and Communists by medium of
unity tickets and the peace movement.
That, of course, would split the Labor
Party, and Mr. Whitlam has not yet
shown he is prepared to face up to that.
He may, of course, be relieved of the
responsibility by the Left. They may be
pressed into what they regard as neces-
sary pre-emptive action if they think
they cannot muster the numbers in
July to retain their power over the
Federal Conference.
They have the Federal Executive and
they could use it against N.S.W. For
some it might appear to be a matter
of now or never.
But, of course, on past performance
and history, it makes sense to predict
only that once again there will be noise
and fuss out of which will re-emerge
the same old squabbling mob, everyone
having backed down at the last moment.
The RSL
"Members know"
EIGHT OL THE nine members of the
RSL’s national executive left Canberra
last week disappointed men. They had
expected that an emergency meeting
of the executive would settle once and
for all the public dispute over the
N.S.W. branch disciplining two League
members for “activities subversive to
RSL policies.”
Executive members believed an ex-
pected appeal from one of the discip-
lined members would be before the
executive, enabling it to take the whole
case out of the hands of the N.S.W.
branch, whose fumbling had caused a
nation-wide outcry against the RSL.
But no appeal arrived and the
executive was left with a do-nothing
meeting. A disappointed national presi-
dent, Sir Arthur Lee, opened the meet-
Sir William Yeo and Sir Arthur Lee
(right) at the RSL’s emergency meeting
ing by refusing to allow consideration
of the case because without an appeal
the executive could only hear the side
of the N.S.W. branch. He confined dis-
cussion to the principles involved.
But if the executive could do nothing
except restate the right of all League
members to dissent from official
League policy, Sir Arthur ensured that
this received the maximum publicity.
“We have been crucified over this and
want the maximum publicity,” he told
Pressmen waiting in the lobby of RSL
headquarters in Canberra for the meet-
ing to finish. A carefully worded state-
ment released by Sir Arthur reaffirmed
the right of all League members to dis-
sent and to join organisations with poli-
cies conflicting with the RSL’s.
This was aimed at countering claims
that the RSL was stifling freedom of
speech in its disciplinary action against
Messrs. Pascoe and Waddington. Sir
Arthur, upset at the effect this was
having on the League’s image, referred
to “blighters” who had been resigning
in a blaze of publicity without first
waiting to hear the facts.
One State branch, he told Pressmen,
had reported to the executive that four
people had resigned three of whom
were unfinancial and the fourth not
even a member of the League.
If eight executive members were
upset about the ineffective executive
meeting, the ninth, Sir William Yeo,
the outspoken president of the N.S.W.
branch, was delighted. “The happiest
meeting I have attended for a long-
time,” he said. “There was no hostility
to the N.S.W. branch.”
But Pressmen chatting to Sir Arthur
Lee after the meeting couldn’t get out
of their minds the fact that the national
executive had seemingly put the stamp
of approval on the actions of Messrs.
Pascoe and Waddington, and had failed
to reverse the disciplinary action taken
against them. One journalist told Sir
Arthur that people would feel the
national executive had done nothing to
clear up the situation. Sir Arthur, puff-
ing intently on his pipe, showed his
disappointment with the do-nothing
executive by snapping back: “That’s too
bad. The RSL is run for members and
not the public. The members will
know.”
The Pacific
Pangu and Nauru
THE COLONIAL picture changed
radically for Australia last week. First
in Papua-New Guinea the long-awaited
political party finally made its appear-
ance in the shape of the Pangu Pati
based on a demand for Ministerial
Government. “The Pangu Pati,” said
one of its leaders, Mr. O. Oala-Rarua
“represents this demand and will go to
the country on this issue at the next
elections.”
Coming on the heels of the conserva-
tive recommendations of the Select
Committee on Constitutional Develop-
ment, which deliberately put ideas of
responsible Ministerial Government out
of court, the Pangu Pati’s formation was
highly significant. If it was not a
declaration of independence, it was
certainly a declaration of opposition,
in a territory where opposition has to
date been timid and tentative.
The principal figures in the party,
the men who will do most to decide
how far its nationalism develops before
the elections next year, are all familiar.
They are patrol officer Mr. H. J.
Nombri, president of the Port Moresby
Workers’ Association Mr. O. Oala-
Rarua, journalist Mr. M. Samare, and
patrol officer Mr. A Mauri Kiki.
Listed as rotating chairmen, they will
be known as “bung.”
However, observers who had studied
several previous, and futile, attempts to
begin political parties in New Guinea
were interested to see some new names
and widespread support promised to the
new organisation. Claiming 40 branches
already established, the Pangu Pati
listed House of Assembly Parliamen-
tarians from Bougainville to Ramti
among its foundation members.
Also significant was the participation
of three Australians, former patrol
O. Oala-Rarua


Chief H. de Robert
officers Messrs. B. Holloway and A.
Voutas, and university teacher Mr. C.
Abel; although Mr. Oala-Rarua was
careful to state that “we are not associ-
ated with any political party in Aus-
tralia or any other country.”
Meanwhile, Nauru’s hard-hitting
Head Chief Hammer de Robert finally
pushed through independence for his
3000 people on the tiny island of
Nauru. The island is one large lump of
phosphate, vital to Australian agricul-
ture, and has been administered by Aus-
tralia on behalf of the joint trustees,
Australia, Britain, and New Zealand.
This administration has provided cheap
superphosphate for Australian farmers,
but low returns on royalties for the
Naurans.
Because rehabilitating the 80 percent
of the island’s surface destroyed by
mining operations will cost S3O million,
and the phosphate deposits will be ex-
hausted in 25 years, independence under
suitable financial arrangements was vital
for the Naurans. Last week Chief de
Robert walked away with some S4OO
million in returns from phosphate, plus
independence on January 31, in his
pocket. Result was a smiling Chief
quite unlike the disgruntled nationalist
who told us in 1964: “You have
behaved like bullies and the whole
world will know how you have treated
us.”
Exports
More spadework
AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS to
bouth-East Asian markets came under
ar P notice from Mr. M. C. Cowley,
Director of the International Division
of the Victorian Employers’ Federation
° n his return from an inspection of
Australian penetration of the area, the
tlve countries concerned being the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mal-
aysia, and Hong Kong.
Not mincing his words, Cowley said,
“It is evident that the lack of a
thorough understanding of the market
and insufficient attention to detail, as
shown by negligible promotion, poor
distribution, and lack of selling effort,
are preventing Australia from obtaining
a fair share of these markets. With
certain exceptions Australian products
are noticeable by their absence. While
the trend to local manufacture is in-
creasing, and there is every good reason
why we should participate in this de-
velopment, there is still ample scope
for the marketing of a wide range of
products and materials. Although the
price is an important factor this doesn’t
stop other countries from marketing
high-price products in the consumer
durables and industrial fields.”
Against these hard words has to be
weighed the excellent performance of
Australian exporters in the past five
years when exports to the area have
been more than doubled. This year to
June 30 they will be close on $250
million compared with $l2O million
five years ago. In the same period New
Zealand only achieved an increase of
roughly a fifth of ours, and this year
its exports to the area will still be
less than $3O million despite energetic
promotion.
Where Cowley is right is on the
score of manufactures. These have been
lagging sadly behind the performance
of rural and minerals exports, which
comprise the bulk of our trade with
the area.
While welcoming Cowley’s jolt to
any complacency on the part of manu-
facturers, and stressing that exports to
the area have become more vital in the
light of Britain’s Common Market
moves, a Department of Trade spokes-
man said Australian manufacturers had
done a lot of solid spade work in the
various countries and this would gradu-
ally bear more fruit. Corrfpetition,
especially from British, U.S., and Dutch
exports, was particularly strong and
backed by generous credit arrange-
ments. Another big obstacle was
American aid; this pre-empting much
of the available trade for U.S. firms
which, in any case, had a big edge on
competitors because of their superior
after-sales servicing facilities for many
products, and their ability to finance
costly samples, say of big industrial
equipment.
The Department of Trade was satis-
fied that the recent small Australian
trade mission to Indonesia will lead to
an expansion of trade with that country.
But competition, notably from German
and Japanese firms also energetically
scouting the opportunities opening up,
is going to be strong. The Department
is at present formulating proposals, such
as extending EPIC’s credit guarantees
for exporters to Indonesia, as a follow-
up to the mission.
Agriculture
Cottoning on
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER
gloomy appraisal in Western Australia
over the future of the Ord project and
its cotton farmers. Last year’s returns
had been finalised, confirming predic-
tions that higher production costs,
lower world prices, and lower bounty
receipts would mean much lower in-
comes for the Ord farmers.
The Federal people who had made
those predictions would have every
reason to crow, but valiant Ord de-
fenders in the West looked at the figures
more closely and saw that the five
original farmers of the Ord project
would either have broken even or made
a profit without bounty payments. This
was seen as evidence that experience
could be equated with success in cotton
growing.
It was hardly likely to swing the
Federal Government around to a favor-
Treasurer McMahon
able view of the project and make it
hand out money for the second stage.
The Ord defenders could see that, and
suggested diversification of crops, “prob-
ably toward supplementing the cattle
industry,” as one more factor that might
strengthen their hopes.
That might have been a tip taken
from Treasurer McMahon’s recent visit
to Queensland, where he inspected the
site of a proposed $26 million dam
near Emerald. Before the visit, cotton-
growing was on the local farmers’
minds; after, they were talking of
pasture development for beef cattle,
sorghum production, and so on.
Publicly, Mr. McMahon spoke only
of cotton and only in discouraging
terms. “This year, Australia will prob-
ably produce all its own domestic re-
quirements, and increases in production
will not attract the present subsidy.”
On the best advice he could get, cotton
would tend to fall lower in price in
coming years.
Strangely enough, this has not dis-
couraged an American firm, Auscott


Pty. Ltd., from taking up 10,000 acres
of land in western N.S.W., despite tight
strictures applied by the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment. Auscott has been granted
water rights for five years only, and
after that is required to break the land
into 14 parcels, sell them, and get out.
The company plans to spend up to $2
million on development, and make
enough from cotton plus sale of the
land within those five years to show a
handsome profit. Locally, there has
been much opposition to the American
venture, with dark murmurs of
“dummying” when the parcels of land
have to be sold in five years, but it is
conceded that the terms would dis-
courage Australian enterprise.
Equally dark threats in the West, of
seeking overseas capital to get the
second stage of the Ord project under
way, may not be so empty after all.
Certainly, they are saying in Western
Australia, not as empty as the North
will remain if the Commonwealth con-
tinues to follow its present policy.
Queensland
Swinging Brisbane
FROM THE DRAWING of the 50th
anniversary Golden Casket lottery to
the dramatic recovery of the Art
Gallery’s stolen Picasso painting “La
Belle Hollandaise,” last week was one
of Brisbane’s most swinging in years.
Best of all, none of these events seemed
connected with the Gold Coast.
The Picasso theft seemed connected
with Queensland’s raging controversy —
who would be the Art Gallery’s new
director? Chairman Sir Leon Trout
was said to favor Brisbane artist James
Wieneke. There were rumors that more
highly talented Southerners had applied
for the job, others that Sir Leon had
decided to sell the Picasso to help build
the new Art Gallery.
Last week the Acting Minister for
Education, Mr. Bjelke-Petersen, was
reviewing the matter. His colleague, the
State Treasurer, Mr. Gordon Chalk, was
thankful to be associated with the popu-
lar, non-contentious Golden Casket
anniversary.
It was held in Brisbane’s monument
to the ancient Greeks, City Hall, and
thousands attended. On the platform,
representatives from four other State
Lotteries, Mr. Chalk, and Mr. John
Zimmerle who had won the first
Casket 50 years ago. But the main dis-
play item was the drawing machine.
This was the villain of the piece,
eventually tossing out a marble which
gave the anniversary Golden Casket
prize to a retired Victorian share-
broker, said to be an habitual lottery
winner, and whose address was—yes,
the Gold Coast.
Queensland’s Gordon Chalk
Mental health
Government apathy
MRS. RAINES, president of the Vic-
torian Division of the Australian Associ-
ation of Relatives and Friends of the
Mentally 111, last week claimed that
the attitude of the Federal Govern-
ment to them was “unbelievable.”
Her complaint issued from the fact
that there are no pensions for the men-
tally ill in Australia. “The last answer
received by our Association from the
Commonwealth Government was that
they would keep the matter under re-
view,” said Mrs. Raines.
“It is not widely enough known that
patients, on entering a mental hospital,
never get a pension and even if they
already had been granted a pension, it
is taken from them. Nor does the State
receive money for their keep.”
The Victorian Parliamentary Labor
Party has taken up the matter and
broadened the attack. Labor Leader
Clyde Holding, said last week that he
would organise a conference between
ALP Parliamentary leaders and the
parents, relatives, and friends interested
in the welfare of mental patients.
Mr. Holding claimed that there
were grave problems in staffing men-
tal institutions, in conditions and in
research. “The Minister of Health in
March this year indicated that at a
medical staff establishment of four posi-
tions, four positions were unfilled. The
statement of Dr. Dax, Chairman of the
Mental Health Authority, that the hos-
pital now has a hospital superintendent,
a resident doctor, and a relief doctor
attending from Ballarat, means that
this institution is still seriously under-
staffed.”
Meanwhile, The Bulletin is able to
state with some authority that both
Federal and State Governments are
keeping these matters under review.
The metric system
Argument
GOING ON THE evidence submitted
to the Senate Select Committee on the
subject in Melbourne late last week it
is going to take rather longer to ?0
over to metric weights and measures
than it has to cross the bridge to
decimal currency. What is "more
industry is by no means unanimous
about wanting to change. The BHP
man at the inquiry was all in favor
the Shell man was dead against, and
the Retail Trade man was somewhere
in between. Every year would mean a
7 percent increase in the cost of chang.
ing over, said the BHP man who
pleaded for an early decision.
When we go over, there will be only-
five countries using the Imperial system
and although the BHP man thought out-
trade with these, notably Britain (prob-
ably to convert though), the U.S. and
N.Z. would suffer, we should gain
hands down with the rest, especially
Asian countries.
But the Shell man, wed only to the
gallon, simply boggled at the cost and
inconvenience. It would cost the com-
pany $4O to convert each of its count-
less petrol pumps. And what has a litre
got that a gallon hasn’t? The Retailer
spoke of another shoppers’ nightmare
in the making, which he hoped wouldn’t
come before the public and the shops
had woken from their dollar and cents
one.
Victoria
Greater Melbourne
SO FAR AS THE Mayor of Port Mel-
bourne is concerned, “the whole thing
is purely and simply a commercial deal
in the interests of big business.”
In Port Melbourne they call things
by their real names and the class enemy
is the class enemy. In this case, the
enemy has taken the shape of the Mel-
bourne City Council, and its prelimin-
ary investigations into extending its
boundaries to cover the municipalities
of Collingwood, Fitzroy, St. Hilda,
Prahran, Richmond, South Melbourne,
and Port Melbourne.
Last Thursday night 28 of Mel-
bourne’s 33 City Councillors heard a
report on the project from the Town
Clerk, Mr. Rogan.
The Chairman of the Councils
general purposes committee, Sir Maur-
ice Nathan, said the meeting was calle
to question the Town Clerk on his
report. Sir Maurice, one of Melbourne s
biggest businessmen and a strong P lo '
moter of the “larger-Melbourne

Well, the
National RQISBS is
more than a dictating
machine, it’s a portable

plays and records for
3 hours (not 40 minutes), has
2 speeds (not just 1): 17/sl 7 /s for dictation
and 3 3 4 i.p.s. for finer musical effects.
So when your secretary hangs up her ear-
phones for the night you whisk the
National home and soak up some music
from the large 6" cabinet speaker. (Most
dictating machines make do with a smaller,
one housed in the mike.) And when you’re
dictating with the RQISBS, you can
switch to “auto-voice” to catch your words
and not your pauses. So why lavish more
on a 1-speed dictating machine? $189.95
buys you a 2-speed, 9-transistor National
tape recorder.

scheme, said: “If all the municipalities
in the scheme can get together, and
forget their differences, the committee’s
work toward a Greater Melbourne over
the past two years will be vindicated
and ratepayers will benefit.” Sir Maur-
ice said, “We are living in a city with
a vast potential, but we are not yet
geared to the dramatic developments
likely in the future.”
The projected Greater Melbourne
would cover 32 square miles and in-
clude more than 300,000 people; yearly
revenue, more than sl7 million.
' Sir Maurice and his planners may
find it difficult for everyone to get
together and forget their differences for,
as the Mayor of Port Melbourne puts
it: “We all know that what they are
really after is the chance of using their
greater size to get bigger loans for
themselves.” (At present, the Greater
Melbourne area could support a loan
program of up to $67 million.)
“Then,” he added, “they will try to
spend the money to bring everyone back
to the city. So the big retailers and busi-
nessmen can sell more, of course.”
The Melbourne Town Clerk, how-
ever, claims that “the plan would allow
big economies in administration. Main-
tenance and construction work could be
carried out more cheaply and to a
better standard. Costs could also be cut
by bulk-buying and would allow the
Council to tackle big redevelopment
projects in the inner suburbs now
beyond the financial capacities of the
local councils.”
The Melbourne City Council has not
yet approved the scheme and when it
does the next step will be to invite the
seven surrounding city councils into
discussions. It is unlikely that any will
approve of the amalgamation, and the
hopes of the Greater Melbourne backers
and the fears of the smaller municipali-
ties will finally be resolved by State
Cabinet, which has the power to create
and abolish local government authori-
ties.
The irony, of course, is in the Mel-
bourne-Sydney contrast. In N.S.W., the
Liberal Government is cutting back the
Labor - dominated City Council’s
“greater Sydney” area.
Civil Aviation Minister Swartz
Airlines
The pilot gap
CIVIL AVIATION Minister Swartz’s
mini-airlines proposal, when it comes to
fruition, will have one easily over-
looked benefit. As well as feeding air
passengers from distant country centres
into the main domestic airlines system,
it will help to feed in young pilots.
Currently both the airlines and young
fliers are suffering effects of the increas-
ing gap between private-licence skills
and jet-airline requirements, which are
roughly the difference between flying a
small solo aircraft and piloting an air-
liner with up to 100 passengers in your
care.
Usually the ybung man aspiring to be
a career pilot starts by paying his way
in learning to fly up to private-licence
standard, when he is one among hun-
dreds in Australia. Then, if he can
afford it, he can go on to gain the skills
necessary for a commercial licence
(there Civil Aviation scholarships
available at this stage), and perhaps
get a job flying crop-dusters or with a
chartering company. After that . . .
The number; of would-be pilots
deterred by these conditions was thrown
into high relief recently when TAA
offered 11 cadetships and received more
than 500 applications. The chosen 11
began their training last week, with 81
weeks of hard grind ahead. When they
graduate, the cadets will have been
trained not just to fly but in airline
procedures generally. They will have
been checked out on jet simulators and
will have instrument ratings to go with
their commercial licences. They will be
ready to become front-line jet skippers.
But what of the 489 applicants who
were not chosen?
The mini-airlines scheme is a rain-
bow on their horizon. It will open possi-
bilities for many more who have battled
through at their own expense to com-
mercial-licence standard. Many of the
mini-airlines are in charter work and
will continue that, requiring further
pilots to man their four-, eight-, and
ten-seater feeder aircraft. Job oppor-
tunities will increase, with the chance of
moving up to the larger airlines. It is
even faintly possible that flying may be
taken into technical schools’ curricu-
lums, or that the little airlines will be
able to train some men.
That may be one of the difficulties
holding a final announcement on which
feeder airline services will begin:
when? Mr. Swartz’s original plan offered
some problems for the operators, some
of whom said it was unworkable with-
out subsidy. They objected particularly
to the rules which said that timetables
must be created and adhered to with-
out change of aircraft according to
passenger load at take-off time; but
subsidy was their main issue, and pilot
training would be unlikely without it.

ANU students
A "guffuffle"
“IT IS UTTERLY meaningless for us
to condemn war. We are not listened
to; we are ignored; we are impotent.”
So cried a speaker at a lively meeting
of 200 students at the Australian
National University in Canberra last
week. They spent two full hours debat-
ing the subject of politics in universi-
ties. There had been two of them on
ABC-TV the night before, their letters
flooded in to the local newspaper, and
half the Students’ Representative Coun-
cil had resigned over the matter, pro-
ducing a flood of ronoed statements on
colored paper. There is another student
meeting scheduled, and finally a poll
of all students.
Formally the guffuffle was about the
way the student-elected bodies should
represent students. One side wants
them to concentrate on doing a more
effective union job, looking after
student matters by representing them
to University administrations and mak-
ing pronouncements and organising
action to get more money for educa-
tion. ANU’s SRC in this view should
concern itself with mundane matters
like library fines, cafeteria facilities,
rooms for student clubs, and societies
and so on.
The “unionists” at the ANU pro-
voked the whole debate by passing a
motion prohibiting the Representative
Council from “all political comment
except in the fields of education, matters
affecting the University, and those
matters where the SRC feels it can
clearly ascertain the opinion of students
at this University.”
It centred on a resolution sent for
ratification from the National Union of
Australian University Students on the
Vietnam war. That resolution is a
familiar collection of “establishment-
left” cliches blaming the Americans for
almost everything and calling on it to
follow the all-wise U Thant.
In this case the “unionists” success-
fully prevented endorsement of the
resolution. This aroused the fury of the
active Left-wingers centred in the Uni-
versity Labor Club and these people
provided a good deal of the protest
drive.
Not that the ANU split is a straight
Left-Right political division. The SRC
president, Alan Brookes, who has led
the unionists, is opposed to our involve-
ment in Vietnam and several of the
activist protestors are in favor. Two
activist speakers in fact wanted the
Canberra SRC unbound by restrictions
on its political action, so that it could
bring the leftist National Union to heel.
“Its main activity consists of making
ridiculous statements on international
affairs,” said one. Another argued it
should “stop passing motions on every-
thing under the sun and get on with
direct action on the Government’s
failure in education.”
But in this case the “activists” may
win the argument. They are able to
appeal to student idealism and the cry
for involvement and action. At the
lunchtime meeting at the ANU last
week they were strongly supported by
staff members Ginnane, Herbst, and
McFarlane. McFarlane in a few roared
sentences was able to point up the
crucial issue when he said: “The
decision to be apolitical is clearly politi-
cal. It is conservative. And this is a
typically conservative act of trying to
run away from politics.”
New Zealand
Decimal notes
NEW ZEALAND’S DECIMAL cur-
rency notes differ from Australia’s in
many ways: all have the Queen’s image
on one side (it’s on Australia’s $1 note
only) and all have New Zealand birds
on the other (where Australia’s have
portraits of historical figures); N.Z.’s
bear the signature of the Reserve Bank’s
Chief Cashier only; the mauve note is
worth $2 while Australia’s is worth $5;
and New Zealand will have a crimson
$lOO note with a chook-like takahe on
one side.
Due for issue on July 10, the new
notes were displayed on colored posters
in banks and post offices a month
earlier at the request of Finance Mini-
ster Muldoon. This gave the public a
chance to become familiar with the de-
signs and the experts a chance to criti-
cise them. An Australian, -Auckland Art
Gallery director Gilbert Docking, said
the new note designs seemed to have
been approved by a committee whose
members hadn’t progressed beyond the
New Zealand art school standards of
the 19305.
The design panel consisted of the
Reserve Bank Governor, the Chief
Cashier, the National Art Gallery direc-
tor, the Parliamentary Historian, and
Canterbury University’s Dean of the
Faculty of Fine Arts. They were im-
mediately defended by a top N.Z. artist,
Peter Mclntyre, who said, “I feel they
are twice as good as the Australian
notes. In design, color, content, and
overall composition they have an un-
doubted charm and appeal.”
After Australia’s experience with
forgeries the designers took extra pre-
cautions. As well as the plastic (not
metallic) thread running through them,
various geometrical patterns and very
fine design printing, with colors thought
difficult to reproduce, will discour-
age forgers. The £ s. d note issue,
totalling £N.Z.BO million should be out
of circulation by mid-September.

COMMENT
How East is our Middle North West?
IN THE balmy days of European
colonial expansion, when the centre of
the world seemed without doubt to be
in the old “Christendom,” Europeans,
as they looked at the map, lumped to-
gether everything to their right as “the
East.”
“The East” began in the Balkans in
the domains of the Ottoman Empire.
This bit of the exotic became “the
Near East.” The Turks’ conquests in
the Arab countries became “the Middle
East,” and that vast stretch of map
that ran from India to Japan was dis-
posed of in one go as “the Far East. ’
Another confusion was added by the
use of “East” and “West” as code
names in the cold war, so that the
Philippines, for example, although part
the Far East” geographically, be-
came part of “the West” politically. It
was typical of European arrogance that
this confusion of terms has continued.
“West” is familiar and good. “East” is
foreign and bad, so goody Easterners
to™ b ' ?*?' : H h r° r u y Th s,er wTs
10 get out of the difficulty. I here was
no break-up of “the East” for political
purposes, however, although there
would be a case for seeing Yugoslavia,
for instance, as an example of the
Political Near East and China of the
Political Far East.
The old nomenclature meant that an
Australian had first to imagine himself
in London so that he could look out
on his North as his East. Similarly, a
San Franciscan would look East to see
his own West. It was not just nonsense
but an attempt to define reality that
prompted R. G. Menzies in 1939 to
coin the phrase Near North for Aus-
tralians looking at the Europeans’ Far
East.
Some of these geographical absur-
dities are fading, although the East-
West political analogy is still going
strong, but no one seems to have
come up with a new idea for the
Middle East” (or, as Australians might
put it, the Middle North West). The
Indians have put up West Asia, but
this hardly seems satisfactory as a de-
scription for a section of the world that
is partly North African. The old term
“Araby” would be fine if it did not
have such anachronistically romantic
connections. Perhaps, until we think o£
.TTT t Se J W ” Sh ° Uld make d ° Whh
“the Arab States.
Words form an image of reality that
can justify old habits or prompt new
actions, so it is not just new-fangled
quibbling to want to change some of
the names in the atlas: it is an attempt
to give a new concept of reality. In this
discourse the worst of words is “Asia.”
What on earth specially unites the
Japanese and the Syrians, for example,
so that they should be thought of as
forming part of the one continent? Or
the Mongolians and the Singaporeans?
“Europe” still makes sense, because
Q f i ts cultural identity, and “Latin
America” (adding the southern part
0 f North America to the rest of
America) also has meaning, as does
“North America” for a description of
what’s left. But it is highly doubtful if
“Africa” is a concept that can last, and
even more doubtful if “Asia” means
anything. Increasingly, “Asia” breaks
down into ideas such as “East Asia,”
“Southern Asia,” “the Indian subcon-
tinent,” and so forth. Some of the
Japanese seem to be trying to wriggle
out of it altogether, with their concept
Q f the “Pacific basin.”

SYDNEY ’67
“You know what all whinging
Sydneysiders know in their own
hearts: this is the place to live”
By CHARLES HIGHAM
SYDNEY, by and large, has had a bad
Press. One recalls James Morris’
hysterical diatribe in the Manchester
“Guardian”—“its politics crooked, it s
organisation slipshod, its suburbs
hideous”—the result, apparently, 0 f
being bawled off a full bus in William
Street by one of our wardress-like con-
ductresses. And J. B. Priestley’s
“Sydney—so noisy, so busy, about
what?” And these are only two of the
more notably querulous among a dozen
or so hymns of hate.
Rude remarks, of course, throw us
all into a state: we can fill our papers
with grumbling letters, talk snootily
about our actors, singers, and writers
as “the locals,” and enjoy the stric-
tures of the aesthetics of this world
sniping incessantly and a trifle boringly
at that horribly phrased “street
furniture,” red roofs, and the lack of a
harbor Marine Drive; but remarks from
the foreign famous draw furious re-
sponses. Are we getting over this? I
doubt it. Even Ray Charles, blind
jazz musician, when he stepped out of
a plane at Mascot, was asked what he
thought of Sydney with that faint hint
of nervous challenge in the voice which
half-expects a bad answer but won’t
be likely to brook anything but a nice
one.
Together with Rio and Buenos Aires,
the most remote of the world’s major
cities, maddeningly not the capital of
Australia as it should be, all too con-
scious of being in the worst hemisphere
(Joern Utzon was once unforgettably
described by a Sydney newspaper as
being “the best architect in the
Southern Hemisphere”), Sydney is still
blighted by provincial stresses.
But the compensations are many.
Sydney is undoubtedly, on a moderate
income, one of the pleasantest cities in
the world to live in. London and New
York are only physically pleasant if
you are rich; in Sydney, as in Los
Angeles and San Francisco, you don’t
have to be. And here the common man
has come into his own in a paradise
of British aspirations released: gardens
and bays and fishing, boating, and
swimming to the heart’s content. In no
other great city of the world can a
white man walk through a city wearing
only shorts, or drive a car in the same
gear without being laughed at. Beaches,
as every visitor points out, are wonder-
fully accessible from the heart of the
city. And Sydneysiders give the city a
zing and style all its own. The main
impression is one of youth, sports clothes
worn with a flair and panache un-
equalled anywhere, eyes and skin
shining with health, shirts whiter-than-
white even at the end of the day. The
obsession with personal cleanliness is
almost Swiss, even if the indifference to
public litter is almost Mediterranean.
If Sydney can be noted for one single
thing, it is in the clean bright excite-
ment of its young crowds in the lunch-
hour, in their buoyancy and vibrancy,
and look of optimism and assurance;
no people ever had a happier heritage,
or were born under a luckier star. And
at the beach in summer, they really


triumph; not even Southern California
can boast this proliferation of physical
beauty and confidence under clear blue
skies. It is a typically Australian para-
dox that so much dash and energy
should be contrasted with mental un-
eas6i lack of certainty, and anxious
looking to overseas models for patterns
0 f thought and behaviour.
Paradoxical, too, that many of the
Sydney young who look so happy
should, above a certain social level at
least, express a constant and bitter self-
denigration, and snipe endlessly at their
city and its prominent figures. One
would call this irreverence and modesty
wholly healthy if it weren’t accom-
panied by so alarming a streak of
cynical mockery and nihilism.
These sparkling people often come
from surprisingly sunless and uniform
houses, which are apt to boast mirrors
the shape of opened fans, flights of
china ducks cn the walls, lounge suites
in purple, humped and menacing, ply-
wood cupboards covered apparently
with some mysterious form of frecDes,
potted plants and worn linoleum or
faded purple Wilton, and curtains of
thick velvet to prevent the lounge
suite from fading in the sun.
Externally, though, the light takes
the edge off the ugliness of houses like
these, a scene of morning mist at
Seaforth can have all the delicate
charm of a Hokusai. At night and in
certain lights and colors, Sydney is as
beautiful as Hong Kong or Rio. Its
beauty, it is true, is less immediately
striking, more subtle and elusive. The
Harbor, with its infinite complexity of
inlets and bays, yields up its treasures
very slowly, and only after many years:
at first glance, it seems disappointing,
lacking—despite the splendid sandstone
cliffs of its entrance —the dramatic
impact of the Peak or Sugar Loaf seen
for the first time. But you can tire of
Hong Kong or Rio in a week. Sydney
can be explored—and adored —for a
lifetime.
It is, because of its scattered and
subtle appeal, the hardest of cities to
write about. It has no focus. If the
Harbor is its focus, then it is one which
shifts continually, like quicksilver in a
bowl of glass, eluding analysis. Men-
tally Sydney is equally shiftless and
watery; ideas founder, people tend to
be slow in their mental reflexes and to
forget films or plays or both they looked
at only last week.
Sport is, as everyone has pointed
out, the one thing apart from cars and
sex that gives drive and enthusiasm to
Sydney talk; and sport is the city’s
central culture. In England, sport is
a torture: footballers in flapping shorts
ploughing through mud and rain at
Burnley, watched by red-nosed crowds
ln mufflers, cricketers doggedly per-
forming their rituals in a Lords drizzle,
schoolboys ploughing up and down
water smelling of antiseptic, rimed with
scum, in indoor baths at Hove or
Weston-Super-Mare. Here, sport is
beautiful to watch, an aesthetic experi-
ence. A scene of elderly women in
white against green lawns playing bowls
has all the formal attraction of a pic-
ture by Seurat or Manet, school swim-
ming races at Bronte Baths combine
emerald flashing water in sunlight,
darkly shining bodies and a dazzle of
surf beyond the perimeter, and horse-
racing, with bright livery against
bronze skin, crowds freshly laundered
and sparkling with health and' excite-
ment against a leaden blue sky un-
touched by clouds and sometimes
haunted by the moon—all this has a
deep visual appeal.
See the crowds bustling through
Martin Place at noon, schoolchildren
having an outing, wharf laborers cavort-
ing through a picnic at Bronte Park,
and you have a powerful impression
of energy, of a kind of released vitality
America once must have had, a vitality
that comes through in its silent films.
I can recall, years ago, taking a tram
(how I miss the trams!) to Brighton-
le-Sands, to see an obscure movie.
Outside the theatre, raucpus-voiced
children in bright dresses or checked
shirts and white jeans were gobbling
ice-creams, there was a smell of dust
in the air, palm trees leaned over yards,
a horse clopped by, and there, on a
white fence, like Tom Sawyer, a boy
was walking, balancing a feather on his
nose. It was a scene that could have
come from a Griffith or a Maurice
Tourneur film in the primitive, innocent
days of Hollywood.
In places like the Georges River, in
enchanting suburbs like Lugarno and
Como, in the donkey rides down a
southern beach, the snake-charmer’s
display at La Perouse, the dilapidated
wooden boatsheds at Botany, the walk
through the clown’s mouth at Luna
Park, in cinemas on children’s matinees
miracles of noise, ice-cream cones,
and lively color Sydney can give to
an adult still the vivid Technicolored
vision of childhood. Sydney skies seem
impossible - sometimes purple, mauve,
even a deep sea-green, with an infinite
range of blues from the palest turquoise
to a thick, turgid navy. These skies
resemble a vast inverted ocean, as much
a presence as the Harbor and the sea
itself. The light has a Grecian bril-
liance; leaves are like metal; shadows
are razor-edged. Walking through some
of the dusty, remote suburbs in the
lunch-hour, as I have just been doing,
under scrubby palms and pines past
service stations and milk-bars, looking
into the faces of the young, one is
struck by a sense of a life apparently
lived altogether pleasantly, painted in
the vividest of primary colors.
And at the St. George Leagues Club
on Anzac Night, I found the apotheosis
of Sydney dreams. A triumphal flight
of steps, deeply carpeted in royal-red,
lead up, not to Her Majesty the Queen
or even to Dr. Coombs, but to a pastel
blur, several feet high, flanked by potted
plants in huge speckled bowls - of
Norm Provan. Five thousand people
had just come back from seeing the
club team in a match. Everywhere,
symbols of the club’s adopted saint
appeared: shields woven into carpets, a
dragon-sJaying figure in the bubbling
lime - colored fountain outside, a
Dragon Den Bar. On the menu for
Anzac Day was Kokoda Trail Soup,
Gallipoli Special, Bully Beef, Pregnant
Goldfish Salad, and Desert Delight. Five
thousand six hundred gallons of beer
are drunk here a week, and the poker
machines squeak and chug away dav
and night.
On the One Day of the Year, the
liveliest aspect of Sydney was, ol
course, in clubs like this and in the
sporting scene. In the morning, the
drab cohorts in their* antique double-
breasted suits could march along Mar-
tin Place to the sombre approval of
Sir William Yeo. but by afternoon the
bagpipes and brass bands had stopped,
and the guttural stammer of the motor
lawnmowers, the slap of yacht sails, and
the yell of the match crowds had taken
over as the central sounds of Sydney.
Earlier that Anzac Day, I had started
a long journey of rediscovery, looking
for the fascinations of this bright and
sportive city. First, I went east, through
the seedy charm of Kings Cross - a
miasma of Hungarian cooking, ancient
whores, littered pavements, and British
provincial architecture—past the green-
tiled Rushcutters Bay Bowl, the fig
trees of Rushcutters Bay Park with
their waxy leaves, muscled limbs and
trunks rising like squids out of the
ground, to the ritzy little suburb of
Double Bay. Here, in a kind of Peyton
Place High Street with awnings, one
shop flourished hand-made Aboriginal
warriors, chess-sets with pieces as big as
egg-cups, wooden madonnas; nearby
were the Geegold Marble Interiors, the
Marble Centre, the Opal Cave. Not
far away too was the Squire Shop, a
miniature Abercrombie and Fitch,
with sports clothes displayed horsily
(and, one would have thought, at
the risk of infection) on beds
of straw and mounts of saddle
leather. Up the road, Hungarian
women mercilessly gossiped in a coffee
lounge and sleek and pricy furniture-
shops lurked around corners, with in-
terior decorators’ men in striped May-
fair shirts, American tight trousers,
Italian shoes, and careful accents.
I drove on to Point Piper, a Mediter-
ranean jumble of quasi-Spanish villas,
Godaiming stockbrokers’ follies, and
American colonial haciendas, with the
Caprice, the most expensive restaurant
in Sydney, looking exactly like a park
toilet. A brown block of flats, glumly
nondescript, housed Chips Rafferty
between Hollywood TV series. At
Watson’s Bay a pier sprouting with
fishing rods, a shack housing the best
seafood restaurant in Sydney, and the
Gap Tavern, like an English roadside
inn covered in black oak beams.
Over the top, now, along a marvel-
lous stretch of road open to the sky

cate charm of a Hokusai. Below: Light

hamburger shops, cafe Chinamen asleep

in hair-curlers, tottering pinball

ings advertising beer and featuring cup-
board-sized and colored men in swim-
ming or football gear. Here is Sondra
and Joy, Senior Stylists’ Beauty Shop
BOTH DIPLOMA HOLDERS OF
COLORING AND PERMING. It
looks as though time has stopped,
Sondra and Joy’s cardboard signs faded
by sun and salt over 30 years.
The beach pavilion is peeling blue
and yellow, its cracked pillars faintly
echoing somebody’s ambitious classical
notions. Inside, it is a bizarre maze of
wooden cabins, mirrors, and stone
floors, with a shower-room whose floor
swims with scum. In a stone enclosure,
seven men, overweight and naked, bang
a ball against the wall with grunts and
sighs, while others, equally nude, skulk
mysteriously round corners or lie help-
lessly absorbing sunlight. Everything
at Bondi is faded, like the colors in a
strip of film left to curl and dry in the
sun.
At Waverley Cemetery, the dead are
buried in the thinnest earth and sand,
shifting in a premature resurrection
down the side of the cliff, cohorts of
sinister stone angels stride above the
ocean, and pretentious Italian tombs,
vulgarly celebrating greengrocers,
dominate the more modest stockbrokers’
or lawyers’ graves. Bronte, with its
rotten castle of wood towering over
the green baths, and nearby a cottage
where I once lived, battling the elements
that threaten everyone at these beach
suburbs.
At Clovelly a rubbish-tip occupies
an ocean-front stretch, with a sign
stuck above Himalayas of junk: “De-
positing of rubbish in this area strictly
forbidden.” Maroubra looks like a
prison camp, Housing Commission
horrors marching over the converted
sandhills, guarding like fortresses a
stretch of nothing. Now come romantic
swamps, rusted vehicles in clumps ot
weed, the stink of slime, and the sail-
ing of mysterious wading birds.
Long Bay Jail, with a splendid
avenue of palm trees that would not
disgrace a hotel in the Bahamas, lead-


■ up to a frowning locked gate. La
perouse with its refineries and snake-
charmer, Botany with its rotted shacks,
its toilets on places of honor on the
headlands, more swamps, a merry-go-
roUnd, and children riding on donkeys
in a bizarre echo of Margate. It isn’t
surprising to come to Ramsgate soon
after, but here the tone is entirely
American, pretty and formal as a Ver-
mont birthday card. Pastel colors, parks
alive with flame trees and jacarandas.
At H st the road ends and we
are out of Sydney. Past Cronulla,
Sutherland: roads snake through snak-
j n o white gums, the bush writhes, the
river shines and a little car-ferry chugs
across water in a setting as charming
as Lugarno, and with an identical name.
All of this area suburbs like
Jannali and Como and Gymea repre-
sents the best of Sydney life: unpre-
tentious, peaceful, remote from the
“real” world. Going north the tone is
more phony and pompous. Suburb
after suburb on the North Shore has
the stern, uppity look of Boston’s Back
Bay or London’s St. John’s Wood, am-
bitious gardens ready for the approval
of “Waratah,” incongruously framed in
unkempt bush. St. Ives is the summit
of pretension; American white is the
“in” non-color, and white iron balconies
with criss-cross patterns, multicolored
Pennsylvania farmhouse chimneys,
white clapboard fronts, dinky eaves,
wheelbarrow's full of showy flowers and
dotty wagon wheels leaning, painted
white only on the viewing side and
picturesquely alone against trees, give
a fancy illusion of a Connecticut
suburb. Postmen cycle about, white
metal letter-boxes are attached to gates,
and the setting, probably not quite by
intention, gives a feeling of being really
the country: roads are unkerbed and
unguttered, grass along the roadside
grows rank, and trees like all Aus-
tralian trees - refuse discipline.
Going west in Sydney proves, by con-
trast, a surprisingly w'arming experi-
ence. Here there is a vivid sense of
working-class affluence. Past eerie suc-
cessive monuments to the Eastern
Suburbs Railway, wooden scaffolding
monstrosities everywhere and a vast
sinister pit near Central Railway, the
suburbs of Alexandria and Redfern
have an engaging life and color rem-
iniscent of Mediterranean tow'ns.
Beyond, instead of the expected laby-
rinth of stone stretching to infinity are
pleasantly clean weatherboard or stone
houses with gardens far better kept than
similar ones in London or San Fran-
cisco, spacious playgrounds, and rows
°f agreeable tree-lined streets (in areas
like Earlwood and Lakemba). Rose-
lands shopping centre, with its glycerine
fountain, its streamers, merry-go-round,
"'agons and fake flowers, marble
flowers and copper rose fountain,
has a splendidly entertaining vulgarity,
a kind of vast glamorised Woolw'orths,
"'hile Bankstown Square offers a res-
taurant admired by Sinatra, Ralph
Richardson, Shirley Bassey, and Peter,
faul and Mary, a telephone box shaped
a pagoda, and a lavish cafe with
international alcoves: Au Petit Paris (a
skyline of St. Germain des Pres), the
Taj Mahal (daubs of Indian temples
and a brass Indian multi-armed figure),
El Cantina (Italian style), The Ginza
(complete with paper lanterns the size
and shape of watermelons), and Old
Heidelberg. Farther on, Liverpool,
wTich everyone says is the w'orst thing
in Sydney, but the shopping centre is
bustling and big, people look as w r ell
fed as they do in Bondi Junction or
Mosman, there are green woods and
fields nearby, and the little houses in
squares of lawn often boast splendid
trees and flowering bushes.
The central city of Sydney is
orientally crowded in the rush-hour.
The people after a day’s w-ork have none
of that glazed look they get in New
York or London, grey and defeated on
the subway or crossing Westminster
Bridge in the fog or sleet like sheep for
the slaughter. Sydney people bustle at
5.30: still clean and bright, they are
heading for an exciting date, something
good on the Box, or a long, cool ses-
sion with the schooners. Around them,
the city has the raw look of a place
still halfway through a building boom,
its nerve centres disrupted and jangling
wdth tension.
On the one side, the old, squat Vic-
torian city with its frumpish airs: the
hideous Queen Victoria Building, be-
loved of John Betjeman and wdth its
domes turned green with rust, the pre-
tentious copper statues in the park
weeping green, the complacent porti-
coes of banks. On the other hand, the
quasi-American flourish of the AMP
building, Harry Seidler’s brutally
phallic Australia Square tower (his ulti-
mate gesture in Sydney?), the up-
ended biscuit tin of Goldfields House,
the sombre tombstone of the State
Office Block. Crowded and (in summer)
desperately uncomfortable though it is,
the city offers some splendid vistas: best
of all, the view- from the top of Mac-
quarie Street, with the sandstone pom-
pous library to the right, and to the
left the long line of wdnd-w-hipped
palms, the curve of blue sky, sometimes
a watery midday moon, and at the
end, through the scimitar leaves, the
white curving cones of the Opera
House.
But alongside the new' American Syd-
ney, alongside the old British one, a
native character survives. It is very
much in the endless, rusted awnings of
the suburban shops and the raw tone of
the pubs the sinister outlandish ones
like those down near the docks, where,
at night, Aborigines lurk in the shadow's,
mirrors are spangled wdth w'hat appears
to be mould, and the barmaids are mag-
nificently slatternly, or in the jangling
places that are the haunt of every kind
of oddball. Very much, too, in the
Stadium during a concert by Australian
teenagers, with the thousands swarming
in fo" a feast of vicarious sex and sub-
Ametican guitar twanging. And in Luna
Park, which brings me full-circle to that
innocent and primitive Sydney I spoke
of earlier.
First, there is that splendid Luna
Clown’s face, my favorite single item
in the whole of Sydney’s architecture.
Thirty-five feet high, like a child’s pic-
ture-book idea of a eunuch King Sol,
made of plaster and chicken-wire, its
bald head sprouts a forest of painted
blades. Its teeth—l 3 incisors and one
molar—are made of glass and wire and
in need of a broom-sized toothbrush,
and its eyelashes are rubber and a foot
long.
Inside, Luna Park on a hot summer’s
day and night unleashes Sydney’s
violent energy and aggression in an
orgy of pleasure. Either in pairs or
packs the Sydney young can travel
Hell’s Railways—which take you to
Horrible Hollow, Hangman’s Hill, Vam-
pire Valley, Suicide Siding, Jittery
Junction, Creepy Creek, Goofy Gorge,
and Ghastly Gulch —through a swaying,
cobweb-strewn route, swinging around
curves, while recorded or actual
screams fill the cramped corridors. Or
they can hang upside down in a
whirling cage of steel, sit in a little
house that turns upside down while you
sit in it (you find yourself, at one stage,
planted firmly on the ceiling), plunge
as the floor falls away into the rotor,
which swings you helplessly round while
you are pinned to the walls by cen-
trifugal force, or take a ride on the Wild
Mouse Switchback, the carriages of
which at one stage, a custodian
informed me, go round a bend on two
wheels (“Two!”). It was here, at Luna
Park, that Berosini, “the greatest attrac-
tion in the world,” once stood on his
head in an iron ring on a 145 ft.
pole (the pole swayed 45ft. either
w'ay), Donny Webb dived from an
80ft. pole into a tank, and Dixie
Lee stood on a swinging ladder 40ft.
high, showung her ample leg to the
multitude. There is nowhere else that
is so completely Sydney so vulgar,
brassy, sexy, and uninhibited.
But if you’re older or staider, if this
aspect of Sydney doesn’t appeal, you
can escape from it more easily than
from the spiritual centre of any other
city. As I write, from my window's over
Middle Harbor, I can see cool bays,
w'hite yacht masts puncturing the w'atery
expanses of the Harbor like needles, an
infinity of smoky olive-colored trees.
Down there, men are watering then-
gardens, children with golden hair and
limbs are playing wdth a miniature
train. Above all, Sydney offers a sense
of leisure, a spaciousness that few other
cities can. All right, it has no great
theatres or galleries, no Ritz, no Four
Seasons, no Tour d’Argent. As you race
down the sand, plunge into the surf, and
see the sun through a white dazzle of
foam, it doesn’t matter, nothing does.
You know what all wringing Sydney-
siders know in their hearts: this is the
place to live.


Holt Abroad
By ALAN REID
WHATEVER ELSE Prime Minister
Harold Holt is doing with Australia’s
foreign policy, he is at least using new
techniques. He does not use diplomatic
language. He does not believe in it. He
says what he thinks.
This is the most noticeable feature
of Holt on his foreign travels. Whether
it is a good technique from the view-
point of Australia’s long-term interests
remains to be seen. External Affairs
policies cannot be judged on their
immediate results. They have to be con-
sidered against the outcome over a
period of years. But on the personal
side, Holt, in adopting this technique,
is at least creating an Australian image.
Those who come into contact with him,
both politicians and officials, concede
cautiously that he is “refreshing.”
You know' where he stands.
Take some of the lines he followed
on his recent trip. Whether they will
turn out to be worth while or boo-boos
only time will tell. But they had the
distinction of putting a firm, unambigu-
ous Australian viewpoint on the record
at a period when many of Holt’s politi-
cal counterparts were being evasive or
non-committal.
Questioned about what he thought
was the likely outcome of the Israeli-
Arab dispute, Holt expressed the
opinion that it was a “flurry.” He was
convinced that the major powers —the
United States and Russia—did not want
an extension of trouble in the Middle
East.
With a boldness that I considered at
the time bordered on recklessness in the
light of events then happening, Holt
stated his personal belief. The events in
the Middle East were worrying. They
would continue to be worrying. But it
was Asia and particularly South-East
Asia that was fundamental to the great
issues of war or peace. It was here in
Asia (which Holt believes is the con-
tinent that will dominate world atten-
tion in the 21st century, just as Europe
dominated world attention in the 20th
century) that mankind’s future would
be decided.
Then there was the question of the
United States’ bombing of North Viet-
nam. There is a section of Australian
opinion which, though pro-United
States in other directions, feels that the
Americans should cease their bombing
activities because a cessation might
produce an atmosphere in which the
North Vietnamese could be persuaded
to the negotiation table. Holt ignores it.
Holt’s view was that the North Viet-
namese could easily enough get negotia-
tions if they wanted them. They had
numerous avenues through which they
could make approaches. If they made
such approaches he had no doubt that
there would be a favorable reaction,
including the cessation of bombing. But
there was no sign that they wanted
negotiations.
Holt gave respectability to his view-
point by pointing out that Deputy
Opposition Leader Lance Barnard had
been converted to the Government’s
viewpoint that what was going on in
South Vietnam was not a civil war but
a war externally sustained from North
Vietnam. But even without this veneer
of respectability that he acquired from
Barnard’s conversion, I am positive that
Holt would have put this viewpoint just
as positively. He believes it. Therefore
he is prepared to put it.
He has an honesty that is rare in a
politician and that could get him into
real trouble some day in the larger
world of foreign policy, just as it has
already on occasions got him into
trouble in the House of Representatives.
It is a type of honesty that, when
recently he was asked what document
he was quoting from in a House of
Representatives debate, produced the
astounding reply “an anonymous letter”
instead of polite evasion, and on
another occasion the revelation that
he was quoting from a Security docu-
ment.
Even in smaller matters, when what
he considers to be security is not
involved, Holt believes in saying what
he thinks. In New York he could
hardly be described as being diplomatic
when he sailed into the United States
Administration on what he holds to be
the “raw deal” the U.S. is handing out
to Australia, a loyal ally, on the
economic side. His beef was against
the preference being given Japan and
Canada in the capital procurement field
in the United States as against Aus-
tralia, “the Pacific flank of United
States’ defence,” and against the manner
in which America had continued
(rather dishonestly) to penalise Aus-
tralian wool even after it had secured
benefits from Australia in return f or
which it was to lessen the anti-Aus-
tralian wool, tariff.
On his major mission to persuade
the United Kingdom to maintain its
military presence on a significant scale
in South-East Asia until the position in
South Vietnam was improved and the
general political stability in the area
more firmly established—Holt failed to
pull off anything major.
He had powerful backing for his
view that maintenance of the British
presence on a worth-while scale was
essential to the stability of the region.
President Johnson had this view and
put it to Britain’s Prime Minister Wil-
son.
Holt had important supplementary
arguments. One of the arguments being
used by those British elements which
wanted complete British withdrawal
from mainland Asia is that the British
presence there was resented by the
Asians. Holt was authorised to tell the
British that neither the T'unku in
Malaya nor Prime Minister Lee in
Singapore wanted the British out. On
the contrary, they wanted them to stay.
Not only that, but Holt was in a
position to tell the British (privately)
that a number of other Asian coun-
tries (including neutral Asian coun-
tries, which, because of their position
could not express their view's openly)
were anxious for Britain to continue in
Asia.
But the British hit Holt with an
almost unanswerable case. However
desirable it was, in the long-term inter-
CANADA ... persuading them to look toward the Pacific


WASHINGTON a new frankness
ests of world peace and the stability
of the area, for Britain to maintain a
significant presence in the region, it
could just not afford to do so. Despite
his superficial optimism, I do not think
that Holt expected at any stage to per-
suade Britain into maintaining unim-
paired its present military presence
in South-East Asia. His dread was a
complete withdrawal that would leave
a power vacuum. What Holt got was
what basically he was after: an under-
taking that Britain would maintain a
presence, even if it was only a
shadowy presence compared with the
past, in South-East Asia.
A major thing that emerged from
Holt’s London talks is his sense of
shock at British apathy toward South-
East Asian problems. Holt believes
that the British Government is not
only closing its eyes to the problems of
an area in which the future of the
world will be decided, but it is
also closing its eyes to its own
interests. As he has pointed out
privately, Britain has a big stake in
the area. It has investments amount-
ing to probably £lOOO million in Aus-
tralia. It has investments somewhere
about the same amount in other coun-
tries vitally concerned in its decision
to withdraw, for all practical purposes,
all its land forces retaining a sea and
air presence only in South-East Asia, by
1975.
Holt undoubtedly expected a better
reaction from the British—one that
took into account the long-term aspects
and consequences, as well as the imme-
diate money saving which —understand-
ably in many ways (they have a mount-
ing unemployment problem)— British
Ministers are almost desperate to make.
Again Holt showed his frankness.
He told Wilson that he thought the
British Government was planning its
South-East Asian move against a back-
ground of insufficient information. He
recommended that British Ministers
go through Asia and see it as it is and
as he had seen it before they went
ahead. Again he revealed his unusual
technique of saying what he thought in
public. He just did not say to Wilson
that he thought the British were im-
perfectly informed on Asian develop-
ments. He said it in a public address
and said that European leaders gener-
ally were, in his opinion, in the same
boat.
As I see it, this trip must have a
psychological effect upon Holt. Holt
has always been pro-United States
minded. His now famous “All the way
with LBJ” statement on Vietnam
(which helped to carry him to an all-
time high victory at the last Federal
elections) demonstrated this. But
always there has been the counter-tug
of his veneration for the British, British
institutions, and British leadership.
From here on, whatever inhibitions Holt
had about intensifying the Australian-
United States relationship at the ex-
pense of the United Kingdom, will tend
to disappear. ' Increasingly Australia
will .move more and more into the
United States orbit and away from
Britain.
You will see the effect of this in a
thousand different ways. For example,
a side by-product will inevitably be
that Australia will hold an increasing
proportion of its overseas reserves in
currencies other than sterling. My
guess is that you will see the side effects
run right through everything the Aus-
tralian Government does.
For Holt the trip has been a major
disappointment, even though as a
realist he did not believe that he would
get what he hoped he would get in the
shape of retention of the British military
presence in South-East Asia in a sub-
stantial form. But whatever the out-
come, Holt is using new techniques of
frankness and direct speaking that is at
least creating the image of an Aus-
tralian Prime Minister who has some
of the traditional characteristics of
his voters—outspokenness and forth-
rightness.
While Holt’s major mission pro-
duced only the minimum of results
far less than Australia wanted, though
still better than the total British with-
drawal, which Holt feared he got
a small unexpected aside, gained when
he visited Canada. Nominally he was
there only to open, officially, the
pleasantly imaginative Australian
pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. But,
a crusader for his view that the world’s
future will be decided by events and
developments in Asia, Holt started ear-
bashing Canadian Prime Minister Lester
Pearson on the importance of Asia.
To the surprise of his advisers, who
were aware that Canada had historically
and traditionally looked out on the
world through its Atlantic window', Holt
evoked a response. He persuaded Pear-
son and his Canadian colleagues that
Canada must look increasingly across
the Pacific, and that in doing this there
should be developed a system of con-
sultation between Canada and Aus-
tralia to replace the Commonwealth
Prime Ministers’ London Conferences,
which, said Holt (with magnificent
understatement), were likely to become
less frequent.
Pearson undoubtedly reacted warmly
to the Holt proposal, as he demon-
strated by his public speeches. Whether
the enthusiasms Holt undoubtedly en-
gendered will outlast the vigor of his
belief in the importance of Asia remains
to be seen.
LONDON a major disappointment


The Pacific Gravy Planes
WHERE TOURISTS want to go, air-
liners are eager to fly them, and the
Pacific, as the last unexploited tourist
paradise, is irresistibly inviting to both
of them. Lured by the promise of vast
revenue in the 19705, when 450-seater
Jumbo jets will begin shuttling tourists,
commuter-style, around the Pacific, no
fewer than 23 American airlines are
jostling for new routes in the region.
For more than a year, the U.S. Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) has been
engaged in what has become known as
the Trans-Pacific Route Investigation,
trying to sort out the claims of all the
American airlines clamoring to share
in the anticipated travel boom.
Because the transpacific route is
seen as such a rich prize, applications
are being pushed by virtually a full
roster of the major American airlines.
A number of them, including TWA
International, Northwest, Pacific,
Pacific Northern, Western and National,
want routes across the north and cen-
tral Pacific, outside Australia’s direct
sphere of interest.
But other airlines have made strong
bids for rights to operate between
North America and Australia and New
Zealand in opposition to the present
American flag-carrier, Pan American.
These are the domestic giants, such
as American Airlines, Continental,
Braniff, Eastern, and United, and it
is among these carriers that the battle
of words and politics is being fought.
Most of the airlines in the trans-
pacific case are forecasting increases
of 300 to 500 percent in traffic in the
next five years, because of anticipated
fare reductions with the introduction
of high-density jets. Accommodation of
this surge of passengers would require
more than 100,000 hotel rooms.
And while all the foreign airlines now
serving the Pacific area, including the
three American ones Pan American,
Trans World, and Northwest would
like to see more hotels at all the major
traffic points, not one of them is in
favor of new airlines entering this
lucrative market.
With the applications which poured
in when the U.S. Government decided
to review the Pacific route structure of
the U.S. flag-carriers, most of the air-
lines submitted rosy plans for the future
-—one even offered 12 flights daily
between Tokyo and the U.S.
The tints of gold and silver all along
the Pacific rainbow induced some of
the applicants to mount costly public
relations operations. Expensive pro-
motional brochures ran to hundreds of
pages. The contents often were rosier
than real. One file, for instance, showed
Sydney and Brisbane in the wrong
places; another airline referred to “Sid-
ney,” a third put Auckland in the
centre of New Zealand’s North Island.
But if enthusiasm led them into error,
it seemed that their optimism about the
volume of future Pacific traffic was bet-
ter founded. According to a survey con-
ducted by the Stanford Research In-
stitute of California, it is reckoned the
growth in transpacific traffic between
1960-75 will be 547 percent, in contrast
with an increase of only 240 percent
for the entire non-Communist world.
It was stated that before the intro-
duction of American jets on the route
in 1959, fewer than 300,000 travellers
flew between the U.S. West Coast and
the Far East and Pacific destinations.
But total traffic across the Pacific be-
tween the U.S. and the Far East has
almost doubled: from 359,028 in 1960
to 709,543 in 1965. Moreover, the
number of travellers by sea has de-
creased from 67,762 to 43,633 in the
same period.
Among the flood of words which
deluged the last hearing by the CAB
in Honolulu, the comments of Pan
JET TO YOUR
PACIFIC
DREAMLAND
“Hawaii, Fiji, New Caledonia, Samoa ..
fly to paradise,” chorus the posters
American were in sober contrast to the
glossy brochures of their aspiring com-
petitors. Pan American, which some
30 years ago pioneered Pacific commer-
cial air services, said that the Pacific
was a “relatively low traffic area”
comparatively few people, in airline
jargon. It warned that licensing of
another carrier past Honolulu in com-
petition with Pan American could lead
to excessive U.S. flag competition.
Pan American has had more than
its share of costs and commercial
trouble in the Pacific. It was late in-
troducing jets on the services between
the U.S. West Coast and Australia, in
1959-60, and took a real beating from
Qantas. At one stage, Qantas had 80
percent of the traffic, and although
competition is much sharper today, the
Australian line still has a bigger share
of the business than anyone else.
Canada’s CPAL, Air New Zealand,
BO AC, and UTA-French Airlines are
all flying across the South Pacific now
Pan-Am. will shortly reach a frequency
of seven flights a week between Sydney
and the U.S., while Qantas is fightin?
back with daylight as well as the tradi-
tional evening departures. BOAC has
moved into three of the prime evening
times, under an agreement with Qantas
and is advertising its new services
strongly both in the U.S. and Britain.
With the spur of this competition
the new Pacific airline strategy is tak-
ing shape. Pan American is throwing
a network of routes through the Pacific
tying into regional air carriers at
specific points such as Honolulu and
Pago Pago. The American flag-carrier
will shortly offer daily flights between
Australia and major points of the U.S.
West Coast, through Auckland, Fiji,
Samoa, Tahiti, and Honolulu. Frequent
connections from Hawaii allow Pan-
Am. to offer Seattle, San Francisco, and
Los Angeles as entry points.
Qantas, BOAC, and Air New Zealand
have combined forces to give a total
of 14 flights a week each way between
Sydney and the U.S., of which four
Qantas and three BOAC services ex-
tend on to New York and London. The
two Air New Zealand flights are after-
noon departures for Los Angeles. There
are also five 9 a.m. Qantas flights to
San Francisco (one fortnightly goes on
to Vancouver). Qantas in addition has
two flights each week via Tahiti to
Mexico . (one continuing to London)
on the highly successful Fiesta Route.
The competitive difference between
the two major groups thus is the variety
of Pacific ports which Pan American
offers, contrasted with the greater
frequency south of Honolulu provided
by the British Commonwealth carriers.
The smaller contestants are UTA-
French Airlines, with one flight a week
via Australia, Noumea, and Tahiti to
Los Angeles, and Canada’s CPAL.
UTA plans to run soon a second
service direct from South-East Asia to
New Caledonia, thereby dodging a
tricky rights problem with Australia.
CPAL, however, is stuck with a
meagre fortnightly frequency to Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, and has little
chance of increasing this to a weekly
flight, considered the minimum for an
economic route. The main reason for
this is that Canada lies off the line of
the routes which the major world
carriers want. This leaves CPAL with
little bargaining power.
The aviation world does not expect
a decision on the American applications
to CAB until almost 1970, when the
effect of the introduction of the super-
jet Boeing 747 s and the imminent in-
troduction of the Concorde supersonics
will be felt.
The only thing certain is that while
there’ll definitely be more pie in the
Pacific sky, there’s no guarantee who
will be getting the biggest pieces.

The Lucky Supercontinent
\S MIGHT BE expected, it has taken
American enterprise to test a theory
that Australia was the centre of one
of the world’s greatest movements. At
an earlier period of our history, accord-
ing to this theory, the present land
masses of India, Antarctica, South
America, and Malagasay were attached
to Australia in the supercontinent of
Gondwana. Then, in one of those splits
that have continued to mark Australian
politics, they moved off.
As an example of Australian initia-
tive, this world movement challenges
those who now see only an imitative
role for our derivative society. Yet we
are now reduced to the humiliating
position that it is an American scientific
expedition that is going to test the
continental drift theory and therefore
our claim to the lost territories of
India, Malagasay, South America, and
Antarctica.
Even at first sight, the circumstances
of the expedition seem suspicious. Why
has the American Government not
bothered to conceal its central interest
in the matter? It has already been
revealed that the body in charge of
the expedition, the strangely titled
Environmental Science Services Ad-
ministration, is part of the U.S. De-
partment of Commerce. On the face
of it, this apparently disingenuous
honesty can be taken as merely another
example of American contempt for
Australian opinion. But at least two
other interpretations are possible.
One of these is connected with the
extraordinary significance for the Ameri-
cans of the initials of the organisations
they create, a characteristic that they
share with some of their allies, such as
the Russians and the Old Order in
Indonesia. Given this acknowledged
special significance that initials have in
American policy-making, it was essen-
tial for us to make an inquiry into the
Environmental Science Services Ad-
ministration to determine more exactly
"hat its initials were. This inquiry has
now revealed that the only possible
conclusion that can be reached is that
tlm initials of this body are “E,” “S,”
S,” and “A.” There is some doubt,
however, as to whether these initials
should be represented as ESSA,
E.S.S.A., or Essa. For reasons that will
l )e indicated, we shall use “Essa.”
The suspicion that occurs at once
I s that if Essa were an “Organisation”
instead of an “Administration” it would,
b y its very initials, be clearly revealed
as an instrument of international Ameri-
can oil interests. The Australian Gov-
ernment should at once demand a
s jmple answer to a very simple ques-
tion: Why has Essa not been described
f a n “Organisation” instead of an
Administration”? Until this question
18 an swered satisfactorily, suspicion must
remain. One knows, of course, that
the question will never be asked. So
we are left with the possibility that
Essa’s floating laboratory, which is now
about to survey the Australian coastline
from North West Cape to Sydney, is
using scientific inquiry as a mere pretext
for a secret oil search.
However, this suspicion does not seem
subtle enough. Is it not more likely
that the covert oil search is itself just
a cover? President Johnson should at
least answer the question: What assur-
ances do we have that the Essa expedit-
ion is not secretly subsidised by CIA
money?
Since we could never be sure of the
honesty of his answer to this question,
let us now consider what motives the
CIA has in financing, behind the double
front of an oil search and a scientific
expedition, a survey of the Australian
coastline.
The answer is obviously South
America. Establish once and for all that
South America may have been part of
Gondwana, or “Australia” as we call
BY A SPOKESMAN FOR THE
GREATER GONDWANA
MOVEMENT
it now, and the historic claim of special
American interest in South America is
exploded. That the survey will not in-
clude those parts of the Australian
coastline from which South America
broke off is merely an example of
American subtlety.
Less obvious is the complicity of
China. However, the significance of only
one fact has to be recognised for the
Chinese silence about American inten-
tions to become quite clear. That fact is
when India drifted away from Aus-
tralia and bumped into Asia the impact
was so great that it forced up the
Tibetan Plateau, thereby giving Aus-
tralia a strongly negotiable claim to
Tibet.
Given the forces lined up against us,
what should be the basis of Australian
policy? In the Greater Gondwana
movement both hawks and doves unite
in having no doubt that Australia has
both a legal and a moral claim to India,
Antarctica, South America, and Mala-
gasay. On this particular question all
that divides them is that some of the
hawks claim Mainland Africa because of
its ethnic ties to Malagasay and some
of the doves are not sure where Mala-
gasay is because they have old maps.
Both sides are equally convinced that
the lost territories of Greater Gondwana
should be restored geographically as
well as politically to Australia ( viz., they
should be towed back and reattached
to the Australian heartland) and on
this question both sides are equally
realistic. Both accept the slogan Pol-
itical unification before geographic
restoration. Geographic unification must
remain a long-term consideration. It
has been recognised that on this ques-
tion we are just not technologically
equipped to handle the problems
involved, yet another example of our
brain drain, our neglect of scientific
research, and our failure to do our
national homework.
A spectrum of opinion divides the
hawks and the doves on questions ol
tactics. At the Far Right of the
aviary there are those who advocate an
immediate start to the Crush Malagasay,
Reoccupation of India, Confront Ant-
arctica, and Come Home South
America campaigns. More subtle and
more to the centre are those who urge
that for a start we should content our-
selves merely with claiming India and
announcing that we have no other ter-
ritorial ambitions, thereby decoying the
U.S.A. into a false sense of security so
far as South America is concerned, and
at the same time drawing China and
Pakistan to our side. To the left of
centre there are those who urge that we
should at first develop the at present
empty wastes of the Australian terri-
tory in Antarctica, believing that if we
do not establish our ability to develop
Antarctica, someone else will. At the
Far Left there is the belief that world
opinion must be educated before we
make any more positive move. To this
end a slide and tape presentation has
already been prepared, stressing the
superiority of our per capita GNP over
Antarctica’s.
In the most responsible quarters an
attempt is now being made to find
some compromise between all points of
view. There is considerable concern
that, while remaining committed in our
posture, we should also remain open-
ended in our options and it is recog-
nised that, in the national interest,
both hardliners and softliners should
come together in a genuinely bi-partisan
approach.
That there is no public debate on
such matters is merely yet another
example of the notorious apathy of the
Australian public. You can walk down
almost any suburban street in our over-
swollen cities and you will not hear
one person whistling the proposed new
national anthem Advance, Australia, on
India, Antarctica, South America, and
Malagasay. Is this not typical of our
national hedonism? We lounge in front
of our TV sets waiting for the sports
results, drinking beer from our plastic
mugs as we whittle next season’s surf-
boards and ignore the great challenges
that await us. How humiliating it would
be if Malagasay laid claim to Gond-
wana before Australia.

OVERSEAS
The Middle East: a question of
profit and loss
WITH THE ARABS in a confused,
defiant mood, hopes of a permanent
Arab settlement in the Middle East
are bound to be disappointed. Indeed
they are utopian.
Even direct talks will be immensely
difficult to arrange. The four Great
Powers may be coming round to the
view that all problems connected with
Palestine should now be raised. No
doubt, if they stick together, which is
uncertain, they can reach agreement
among themselves, but can they impose
it on the Arabs? They must surely
know that the one thing they cannot
impose is a permanent negotiated peace.
The best they can hope for is a long-
term truce, guaranteed by the Powers
with the more or less implicit agree-
ment of the Arabs and Israelis.
Who gains then and who loses?
The Americans will no doubt have to
pay for much of the broken crockery.
In Nasser’s eye, America was the
villain, the arch-conspirator, the great
affluent overlord whose blind pressures
drove him to his knees. Much of this
mud will stick. But the Americans’
position is not irretrievably lost: they
have great reserves of power and wealth
which will almost inevitably bring
them back on the Arab scene. But they
must be careful not to support Israel’s
claims to stay in West Jordan.
Russia’s gains are certain despite its
failure to intervene in battle. The Rus-
sians will now seek to efface Arab dis-
appointment by strong support in the
political phase now starting. The
Soviet Union has got itself accepted as
a Power that must be consulted in any
international settlement in the Middle
East. If Jerusalem is internationalised,
a Russian delegate will sit in the Holy
City. Meanwhile, it avoided a dangerous
confrontation with the United States.
Ihese are enormous gains.
France has emerged as a disinterested,
honest intermediary as the only
Western State really to understand the
third World. For President de Gaulle
there are other benefits, too. He has
Proved his point about England’s slavish
attachment to America. And by talk-
jng to Kosygin on the “green line*’ he
has moved a step nearer to his dream
0 a Franco-Russian entente the
Political reality of the pre-1914 world
ln which he grew up.
What about the British? Their pros-
P ects ar e dim. In a single speech at the
very start of the crisis, Mr. Wilson took
sides and threw away Britain’s supreme
chance of a better deal with the Arabs.
The proposed declaration of the Mari-
time Powers will not be forgiven. The
subsequent talk of neutrality will not be
believed. British oil and trading com-
panies in Arabia will find life much
harder and, unlike America, Britain has
no resources to buy its way back.
What of the contestants themselves?
Who gains and who loses? The Israelis
are cock of the roost. They have
demonstrated the greatly superior
striking power of their modern, tightly
organised society over their sprawling,
feuding, overtalkative neighbors. They
have acquired vast territorial gains, no
doubt as bargaining counters. Their
vessels sail once more in the Gulf of
Aqaba. But the gulf between them and
the Arab States is immeasurably wider.
A new Arab generation has felt the
bite of their fire and will not easily
forget.
Among the Arab leaders, King
Hussein comes off best: he fought
bravely against overwhelming odds. His
Palestinian subjects, egged on by Cairo,
forced him into a war he knew he
could not win. He has paid the con-
sequences. His army has been destroyed
and he has lost the west bank of the
Jordan. His resentment against Nasser
must be great. But if he recovers the
west bank he may yet come well out
of it. Hashemite sentiment is far from
dead even in Syria.
What of the guerillas to whom the
Syrians gave support? Their self-
appointed role was to provoke Israel
so as to force Nasser to unleash his
power. They saw themselves as the
trigger to Egypt’s gun. But now that
Egypt’s power has collapsed they must
re-think their strategy. Some talk of
creating a Vietnam situation, but one
is bound to be sceptical. The weakness
of these extremists is that they looked
only to Nasser, worshipping him, at-
tributing to him superhuman powers.
Now they are at sea.
On all sides there has been a vast
failure of communication. Both the
West and Nasser’s Arab admirers never
really believed that he did not want
war. He said it often enough. For years
he has quietly argued that the Arabs
were not ready to fight Israel; that
behind Israel stood the Great Powers;
that he had no quick solution to the
Palestine problem, which he once de-
scribed as the most difficult in the
world.
Nasser saved the Arabs from war over
the Jordan waters two years ago. He
saved them from war last November
when Israel attacked Jordan; he opposed

guerilla raids as too provocative; he
would have liked to overthrow the noisy,
irresponsible Syrians. But his followers
heard only the rumble of Egyptian guns
and the bold talk of Egyptian rockets
able to pulverise Tel Aviv in a trice.
Nasser’s dilemma was that he had to
talk tough because he was weak.
The Syrians bear a large measure of
responsibility for the present catas-
trophe. By their talk of a popular
liberation war, their encouragement of
guerillas, they provoked the threat of
an Israeli attack. Terrified, they ran to
Nasser for protection. But they had
outrun their own and his resources.
By a brilliant series of political moves,
Nasser all but restored the situation.
He wrested the initiative from Israel,
expelled the United Nations Emergency
Force, closed the Gulf of Aqaba. Reluc-
tantly the Western Powers were about
to accept the fait accompli. They were
not prepared to go to war over the
Gulf and took refuge in pious declara-
tions.
Nasser did not believe Israel would
act alone. He thought his brinkmanship
had succeeded. He was wrong.
The war has wounded Nasser to the
depths of his strange and gifted being.
If he survives—as he appears to have
done—he will be far more dangerous
to the West and to rival Arab regimes
than in the past. He will seek revenge
for the conspiracy which he sees ranged
against him.
The great battle for the Arabian
peninsula will soon be joined. The
weapons used will be terrorism, mob
attacks, incitements to murder and
burn. Already much oil has stopped
flowing to Britain and America. Arab
ports and the Suez Canal are closed to
them. Their interests throughout the
whole area are threatened. Nasser will
not rest until all trace of their influence
is gone.
All the West need now do to speed
the process is to congratulate itself on
Israel’s victory and seek to profit from
it.
South-East Asia
Looking for ties
THAILAND IS TRYING to put new
life in the year-old proposal to estab-
lish a regional grouping in South-East
Asia. The notion was first canvassed
at the Bangkok conference which ended
the Indonesian-Malaysian confrontation.
In the afterglow of the Bangkok
agreement it was easy to be enthusiastic
about brotherliness and regional co-
operation. The ill-feeling between
Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines
which had wrecked other group projects
was dissipated. The general assumption
was that it was all a temporary aberr
tion, attributable substantially, if jA'
altogether, to Mr. Sukarno’s ’megalo
mania.
In the succeeding months regionalism
took low priority beside urgent domestic
preoccupations: Indonesia’s need to rid
itself of Sukarnoism and rehabilitate it
self financially; Malaysia’s problem of
containing separatism in Sarawak and
Sabah; Singapore’s task of making a
city-state, which was suddenly cut off
from its traditional hinterland, politic.
Malaysia’s Abdul Rahman (right) ...
disenchanted with regional togetherness
ally and economically viable; and the
Philippines’ quadrennial trauma of
adjusting to a new government.
Thailand alone has been relatively
free of such local pressures, and the
Thai Foreign Minister, Mr. Thanat
Khoman, is now on a round of pro-
selytising visits that began with a dis-
appointing trip to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman,
who is the oldest and some
would say the least prone to wishful
thinking of the five leaders con-
cerned, showed no more interest than
neighborly politeness demanded, and
insisted on calling the talks “purely
exploratory.” He still ruminates sadly
about what he privately refers to as the
“instability of the Filipinos,” pointedly
referring to former President Macapa-
gal’s willingness to press his disputed
claim to Sabah to the point of destroy-
ing the Tunku’s own protege organisa-
tion, the Association of South-East
Asia (ASA) linking Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Thailand.
The Tunku is also worried about the
way his opponents on Malaysia’s east
coast might move if Indonesia comes
politically nearer to Malaysia. His fears
of the dangerous exploitation of blood
ties were roused by the refusal of Pan*
Malaysia Islamic Party leaders to sup-
port Malaysia during its conflict with
Indonesia. The short, unhappy expen-
ence of political association with Singa-

able that he resorted uncharacteristical y

]y[r. Khoman will find more respon-
sive customers eleswhere on his itin-
erary. Mr. Lee Kuan-yew is the most
articulate of the regionalists in Asia.
He sees his city-state of Singapore as
“the sparking-plug in a South-East
Asian regional grouping.” He has tried
to persuade India to align itself with
such a body.
The attitude of the new Indonesian
leaders toward a regional grouping of
South-East Asian nations is very like
President Sukarno’s pre-confrontation
position. As. Mr. Sukarno once told his
Asian ambassadors, “the future con-
frontation in Asia will be against the
Chinese” and “only an alliance of the
Malay people (including the Filipinos),
the Indian subcontinent, Thailand, and
Japan would be able to meet the chal-
lenge.” Last week the Foreign Minister,
Mr. Malik, returned to Djakarta from
visits to Burma, Cambodia, and the
Philippines. He announced that he had
gained agreement in Manila on a con-
ference of Foreign Ministers to be held
in August in Bangkok to discuss setting
up a new regional organisation. The
Cambodians and the Burmese would
not be attending, but, according to Mr.
Malik, they had welcomed the idea of
regional co-operation.
There are some massive funda-
mental obstacles to the rapid develop-
ment of regionalism in South-East Asia.
The only organisation started in Asia
which has succeeded in making co-
operation work is the Colombo Plan,
which is basically a technical aid opera-
tion. The Bandung conference of 1955
issued a 12-point plan for regional
economic co-operation. There were one
or two perfunctory efforts to give sub-
stance to these intentions but they came
to nothing.
The competitive character of the
traditional patterns of trade in tea,
rubber, coconut, and tin obscured the
possible advantages of co-operative
effort. A series of proposals to establish
buffer stocks fizzled out in talk.

Graveyard of hopes
THE FRENCH used to call Indo-China
the graveyard of the reputations of
good soldiers and diplomats.” Ameri-
can diplomats and soldiers have now
been discovering the truth of this for
themselves. The removal of Lieuten-
ant-General Lewis W. Walt, and his
reassignment to a desk job in Washing-
ton, is a case in point. General Walt

much responsibility for the pacification
of villages freed by the Marines.
General Walt is now back in the
Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff of
the Marine Corps personnel. First
reports said that he was being re-
assigned as Director of Personnel, a
two-star job, but apparently Mr. Mc-
Namara intervened to rectify an in-
justice to General Walt.
And injustice it was, for if the mili-
tary situation in the First Corps area
(or “Eye Corps” as it is called) has
deteriorated, and if the pacification
program there is in a shambles, it is
not for military but for political rea-
sons. Like other American soldiers,
General Walt had been trained to keep
out of politics. In any case, the polit-
ical game was played in Saigon and
in Washington, and not in Chu-Lai,
where he had his command post.
General Walt was made the scapegoat
for failure a failure due to a wrong
assessment of the political situation in
the First Corps area.
To understand this, it must be re-
membered that, until the renewed
offensive of the Viet Cong NVA (North
Vietnamese Army) in the northern pro-
vinces, the situation had been “good.”
The pacification program was proceed-
ing smoothly and with apparent suc-
cess. The population was apparently
responsive to American and Vietnamese
Government psychological persuasion,
General Walt... soldiering not enough
or “psywar” as it is called. The VC-
NVA forces were being broken up and
pushed back into the hills, and the
area was relatively secure.
Then suddenly it all flared up. The
VC-NVA embarked on a big offensive
in early April, rendering the situation
so critical that at one point General
yah had to call for reinforcements
hom Saigon (an infantry brigade was
flown to Chu-Lai). The' call for help
w as embarrassing for the Marines, re-
vealing the seriousness of the situation.

martial qualities of the Communist
troops, but also to the growing hostility
of the population in the area to the Ky
Government —and, by association, to the
U.S.
General Walt was reported to have
been appalled by the political turmoil
when the Buddhists spearheaded a new
rebellion against the Saigon Govern-
ment. It was said at the time that the
turmoil had set the General’s efforts
back at least 12 months. In retrospect,
that was a correct assessment.
At the time, Ambassador Cabot Lodge
and General Westmoreland decided to
give their full support to General Ky,
and General Walt had no alternative
but to carry out official policy. Now he
is paying for the losses; that is a soldier’s
fate.
From his new post in Washington,
General Walt defended the Marines’
role in pacification, saying, “We’ve got
to do both jobs —fighting and pacifica-
tion — a t the same time. I believe that’s
what this war is all about.”
Whatever happens over the next few
years, one thing is certain—many more
American diplomats, soldiers, and
indeed politicians will see their reputa-
tions, and even careers, thrown into the
common graveyard of Vietnam. Viet-
nam is a monster which devours foes
and friends alike unless they know its
secret, and this secret seems well kept.
(A "Far Eastern Economic Review" report)
Okinawa
An angry fortress
ANTI-AMERICAN violence may soon
erupt on the island “keystone” of the
United States’ defences in the West
Pacific, only 400 miles from the
Chinese coast. The Japanese inhabi-
tants of Okinawa, which is now a
billion-dollar nuclear fortress, are angry
at the failure of Congress to approve
a small addition to the annual subsidy
with which the United States supports
the economy of the Ryukyu chain of
islands. This is only the newest focus
for a discontent which has festered
since the islands were taken in a
bloody battle during World War 11.
The chain, stretching from Southern
Japan to Formosa, was assigned to
sole trusteeship of the United States, in
the 1952 peace treaty with Japan, with
the Japanese retaining “residual
sovereignty.” For 20 years the inhabi-
tants, who number nearly one million,
have been demanding that they should
be returned to Japan and the issue has
become a sore spot in relations between
)hat country and the United States.
Phe socialist opposition as well as
Popular opinion in Japan has been
Putting increasing pressure on the
Government party to change the status
quo. Recently Mr. Sato, the Prime
Minister, proposed to foreign journal-
ists, according to Press reports, that
the United States restore to Japan
jurisdiction over islands near Okinawa
which do not serve a military use, as
well as over the Bonin chain, which
has little strategic value.
Although the advent of long-range
bombers and troop-carrying aircraft
and nuclear-powered submarines has
somewhat decreased Okinawa’s
strategic importance, the present hos-
tilities in Vietnam (Okinawa is an im-
portant supply base for men and
materials) and the need for pre-
cautions against Communist China
make it impossible for America to
consider a total withdrawal at this
time. If Okinawa were to rejoin
Japan, the Security Treaty between
the United States and Japan would
prevent the United States from keep-
ing nuclear weapons there; nor would
the United States be able to send
troops from Okinawa into combat
without the permission of the Japanese
Government.
But there are other steps which
America could take to pacify disgruntled
Ryukyuans. For instance, more could
be done to help the economy. Aside
from the annual military expenditures
of $U.5.240 million which foster a false
boom (so long as the war in Vietnam
continues) and provide almost half of
the gross national product, direct
economic aid has been held to a ceiling
of SU.S.I2 million a year. This is less
assistance than that given by Japan,
which is participating increasingly in
the economic, social, and educational
development of the Ryukyuans. Political
development is also lagging. A long
campaign by the islanders for direct
election of their own chief executive
(who serves under the high commis-
sioner appointed by the United States)
has achieved only permission for the
legislature to choose him. It was feared
that any chief who was directly elected
would be sure to support the return of
the islands to Japan.
Recent concessions, such as the right
for Ryukyuans’ fishing vessels to fly the
Japanese flag and for natives to travel
abroad on Japanese passports, have only
increased nationalist feelings. The
United States would do well to accept
Japanese Premier Sato’s suggestion for a
partial return of the islands and to make
clear to the islanders that the American
presence will be economically more
valuable—and non-permanent.

French food with your Meale
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
AUSTRALIA has produced its fair
share of promoters, particularly in the
fields of boxing, variety theatre, and
pop music; the latest promoter of
promise has emerged in the arcane
and unlikely world of contemporary
music.
James Murdoch is 37 and secretary
of the Melbourne branch of the Inter-
national Society for Contemporary
Music. He is fed-up with small crowds,
numbing wooden seats, and draughty
halls. “What I want,” he says, “is
sophisticated people in sophisticated
surroundings. No more of this huddling
alone in a cold hall listening to incom-
prehensibility.”
Mr. Murdoch and his Society for
Contemporary Music have hired the
Lido, Melbourne’s biggest night-spot
now presenting “Spice of Life,” a
“Radio City Music Hall Revue” for
an evening of contemporary French
music in July. The program begins at
6.30 with champagne cocktails and
hors-d’oeuvre. The music comes on
at 7, gently at first, with works by
Ravel and Debussy, and then more
demandingly in the works of Messiaen
and Boulez.
Dinner follows at 8.15, a French
meal, after which there will be a per-
formance of “Sports et Divertissements,”
French cafe music of Erik Satie.
Preferential table booking is being ar-
ranged at $lO per seat.
Why the French accent? Mr. Mur-
doch explains: “Let’s face it. If con-
temporary music is to catch on in
Australia it must be promoted. People
must be led into it. Now, French music
is more delicious sounding than most
and will go superbly with a French
dinner. And French things have that
element of extra chic, anyway.”
Performers at the French concert
will include the Adelaide flautist David
Cubbin, the soprano Marissa Brumby,
John Glickmaw, of the Cremona String
Quartet, pianists Keith Humble and
Graham Hair, and the Sydney com-
poser and pianist Richard Meale, who
is noted for his playing of Messiaen.
“Hearing Meale play Messiaen,” music
critic Kenneth Hince has said, “is like
hearing John the Baptist preach a
sermon.”
The concert in the luxury of the
Lido is to be an overture to a festival
of 20th-century music later this
year. In September and October over
two and a half weeks the Society of Con-
temporary Music will promote a series
of concerts ranging from modern opera
to electronic music. The Festival will
include a workshop concert with the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under
John Hopkins; four invitation concerts in
association with the ABC; a series of
films, exhibitions of notation, stage de-
sign, manuscripts, and art; a seminar on
ethnomusicology; and a performance
of Asian music.
Peter Sculthorpe’s “Sun Music V,”
for full orchestra, which was commis-
sioned by the Society for Contem-
porary Music, will be given its world
premiere performance at the Festival.
The society has written to Picasso
asking him for a poster for the festival.
James Murdoch admits that this is a
hundred-to-one shot, but says, “It is
worth a try; imagine the publicity value
if he agrees.” Generally, the plans of
the Society are much more practical.
“After years of concerts attended by
small audiences, the Committee of
ISCM feels that a fresh approach to
concerts of contemporary music is
necessary and timely,” he added.
“The Victorian branch of the ISCM
believes its activities can attract the
attention and support of a larger section
of the public. This is pertinent to its
aims and necessary for its future plans,
which are ambitious.”

leries, Sydney.
DAVID ASPDEN’S painting is the
antithesis of cloisonne and geometrical
abstraction; formerly his work consisted
of large discs split diagonally or over-
lapped with single leaf shapes with razor
edges cutting into areas of uninflected
flat paint. Then, in 1966, his glowing
symmetrically placed verticals
encroached on a central vertical band
whose color was not repeated elsewhere.
These had something of the simple,
James Murdoch... no more huddling
fresh radiance of Morris Louis’ feathery
stripes. The new works resemble, if
anything, the late, large, rather murkily
stained paintings of Louis, in which
transparent layers of the same color are
floated over an absorbent, unprimed
canvas in such a way as to identify the
slight texture of the canvas with the
color.
The color is not on, but in the sur-
face, as Olitski, whose work also
resembles Aspden’s would say. Like
Olitski’s, Aspden’s new work is anti-
linear; to Olitski, line indicates drawing
and not painting—a view that might
help Olitski, but not historians and
Aspden and Olitski, who is a contro-
versial figure in the States, believe that
pure color is unbounded and has no
inflections within it to indicate direction.
In action painting line and mass were
identical as they traversed the canvas;
Aspden’s abstracts are just floating,
vaporous veils, relaxed, impalpable, and
diaphanous. There is no tension, no
focal points, no opposition of contrary
shapes; canvases glow like crimson
furnaces, caress like orange, silky mists,
descend in soft clouds of brown or
magenta. They are not so passive as they
sound, for they have a mild tumescence.
Slow Black drifts and unfolds like a
velvet shroud; in another, a uniform
area of green gently pushes against
margins of yellow and reminds us ot
what has been said of Rothko’s cloudy
rectangles: they are Zen Buddhists’ tele-
vision sets.
Remote and contemplative as they
are in their rejection of the rules o
composition, the paintings are n°j
divorced from our world. Collage an
urban preoccupations have allowed the
environment to invade modern painting,
which goes unframed, or nearly so, as
though part of the environment itse
The frame, like other rigid distinctions,
is no longer a barrier: photograp s

If you're a success in business, the
chances are you are an individualist.
What better way to express your per-
sonality than with a genuine Oriental
rug. Each is as unique as the weaver
who made it.
An Oriental rug is no ordinary carpet,
but a hand-woven original. It reflects
both the personality of its weaver
and the characteristics of the place
where it was made. Whether you
choose an elegant, refined rug pro-
duced by city craftsmen, a striking
colourful example woven by the
nomadic tribal weavers of the plains,
or a subtle deep-toned geometric rug
from the north east steppes, there
is one that will reflect your distinctive
taste and add the cachet of original
art to your room.

bleed out, happenings reduce the dis-

Aspden paints as if his works were side-
effects of events.
They resemble, too, mists out of
Turner or fuming, crimson sunsets —a
little decorative and decorous and lack-
ing what Picasso found in Cezanne—
anxiety.
Melbourne’s Roger Kemp is over-
anxious in his yearning to make the
basic principles (ignored in Aspden’s
aesthetic) of rhythm, space, structure,
and contrarieties expressive. Kemp
cannot lurch into his gloomy terrain
until he establishes his black substruc-
ture, which he then begins to subdue
so that it becomes a complement to his
gritty-greys, fawns, blues, and a new
dusty-pink. The opposition between the
black, smudged scaffolding and the
simple areas of color produces a rough
awkwardness —the antithesis of Aspden’s
svelte suavity and the orchestrated
sequence of movements reveals itself
only in momentary flashes. In some, the
subterranean rhythm has as locus a
bird or ruddy human form, but in
others, where the erupting stained-glass
boundaries of, say, Sequence Develop-
ing, are absent, and control by cloisonne
emphasis has abdicated, the rhythms are
elusive, but part of the secret of Kemp’s
work is the discovery of these rhythms:
how, for example, the centripetal and
centrifugal forces in the discs of Experi-
ence with Direction control the seem-
ingly indiscriminate ragged slabs of
color.
In his concern with the balance of
minor and major tensions, Kemp de-
mands a lot from painting, and he
could recall that Monet’s huge water-
lily paintings, based upon hidden
rhythmical sequences, have a most
unobtrusive and unobsessive architec-
ture. Of course, whatever Kemp does,
a brooding, sombre emotion defeats the
concern with architectonic structure
and it’s the contest between mood and
form that makes his work so powerful.
James Doolin, of Philadephia, via
Melbourne, is of the school of the non-
optical, non-symbolical, clear-cut, geo-
metrical signs; he’s in the style of flat,
symmetrical sour-bright color of Ger-
mans like Peter Bruning and Winfred
Gaul; hypnotic and implacable, they
direct you like road signs on highways
that must lead to disciplinarians’ para-
dises. Doolin, in these Artificial Land-
scapes, disposes sharp forms with skill,
but if Aspden’s are sweet narcotics,
these are uncomfortably mesmeric.
Herbert Flugelman negotiates a num-
ber of highways at once, combining
Ned Kelly, collages of early Renais-
sance painting, squares of plaster,
action-painting, and gesture in a suc-
cessful synthesis that makes this his best
show to date. Some are artistic parodies
°f the styles: a red square, a slash, paste-
ups of soft nudes and tough geometri-
cal sculpture against liquescent land-
scape remind us that promiscuity, as
we ll as Doolin’s and Aspden’s purity,
has its virtues artistically, of course.
Melbourne Film Festival
A pronounced yawn
By PHILLIP ADAMS
JORN (pronounced “yawn”) DON-
NER looks well on the way to winning
the Melbourne Film Festival’s wooden
spoon. Once a film critic, the enfant
terrible of Swedish cinema gained some
useful notoriety by writing a book
which gave “less than the customary
reverence” to the eminent Ingmar.
Hence, the program notes observe, “it
is no surprise that Conner’s films show
no influence of Bergman.” There’s
another reason. On the evidence of
“Adventure Starts Here,” another in-
fluence would burst Donner’s film at
the splices. “Adventure” was so
crammed with Resnais and Antonioni
there was hardly room for Conner.
A Swedish fashion designer travels to
Helsinki to say hello and goodbye to a
Finnish architect she’d met last year
in Berlin or was it Marienbad? For
the remaining 93 minutes Yawn props
them around the landscape like a pair
of window dummies while they have
the usual fragmented flashbacks.
Conner, a guest at the festival, went
on from this pretentious exercise in
cinematic, thumb - twiddling to intro-
duce the other Swedish entry, Bo
Widerberg’s “Love 65,” suggesting that
we wouldn’t find it up to much.
“Widerberg couldn’t organise his
material,” said Conner, having organ-
ised his own to death. But “Love 65”
was as rich and emotional as “Adven-
ture” was bland and bloodless. Like
“B|,” it was an introspective study of
a director trying to relate himself to
others and his environment, but where
Fellini’s film was gothic goonery,
Widerberg’s was melancholy and spare.
Fellini crowded his scene with symbols,
but Widerberg relied on one: kites
flying on a cliff top. Throughout the
film they soared like hopes, while at
the end of their tethers Widerberg’s
characters remained inarticulate and
earthbound.
Throughout the film, Widerberg’s
director theorises matter-of-factly about
his medium. “I would like to make a
film that was as concrete as something
you say across the breakfast table.”
“Love 65” - and “Raven’s End,” his
brilliant 1966 Festival entry suggest
that he will. For while Conner and his
ilk turn cinema into a boutique of
fashionable poses, it is the content and
conflict of the characters that impose
the form in Widerberg’s work.
Gary Cooper once attributed the
success of the Western to the beauty
of the horse in motion. Hungary’s
“Elegy,” obsessed with that beauty, is
also a film of protest. We saw the
horses in Altamira’s ancient caves,
horses galloping eerily in twilight,
horses performing in an Impressionist’s
circus. We saw them at racetracks,
wars, and coronations, pulling drays

and carved on merry-go-rounds. Then
we saw them in abattoirs, being blind-
folded and felled by arcing hammers
and the audience hissed. They hissed
again through “Le Drame de Taureau,”
a hard look at the obscene poetry of the
bullfight. But why? Both films were
critical, angry. Was the audience hiss-
ing the perpetrators of the original
cruelty? Were they confusing the
motives of the film-makers? No. It
seemed they* were simply playing cen-
sor, annoyed at seeing aspects of reality
they found distasteful.
After the collapse of the 1848 Revo-
lution against the Hapsburgs, a band
of guerillas formed behind a Hungarian
Robin Hood called Sandor-Rozsa and
became legendary across the Great
Plain. As Miklos Jancso’s “The Hope-
less Ones” begins, the Austrian army
has rounded up a host of insurgents
and placed them in an antique concen-
tration camp. Among them is Sandor’s
elite, and the Austrian’s job is to cull
them out. So begins a macabre chess
game of Austrian royalty against Hun-
garian pawns. The film even looks
like a chess match, with its images of
black figures against white prison walls.
One by one the sullen prisoners are
tricked into exposing themselves. The
officers isolate key prisoners and create
Judas after Judas with the threat of
the gallows. The pawns begin to betray
and murder each other, but the process
is too slow.
Made with almost Eisensteinian for-
mality, Jancso’s film was hypnotic,
austere, and perfect in its own grim
terms. It was also unpopular.
There’s a theory that the x Anita
Ekbergs and Jayne Mansfields of the
world were created by cinema’s miso-
gynists to parody the hated sex. Some
support for this idea was found in
“Woman As a Flower,” a French tri-
bute to Art Nouveau’s erotic yet
strangely asexual view of the female.
Written with an irony and style of
which Oscar Fingall O’Flahertie himself
would have been proud, it followed the
reptilian lines of Aubrey Beardsley into
a world where even wrought-iron had
to acknowledge the supremacy of the
flower.
Sydney Film Festival
Not quite festive
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
AS FAR AS I was concerned, the
fourteenth Sydney Film Festival did end
with a whimper a lugubrious Eng-
lish film called “Four In The Morn-
ing,” which plods funereally through
the stories of three women one a
suicide, one a disillusioned nightclub
hostess making a last, unsuccessful
attempt to find love, the third, a youn?
wife trapped in an unsatisfactory
marriage. Is this swinging London? The
film was conceived by Anthony Sim-
mons as a short, his self-indulgence
in expanding it to feature length has
been its ruination. A pity, because the
players are capable, the Thames-side
photography effective, and some of
Simmons’ scriptwriting (particularly i n
the sequences with the married couple)
perceptive.
The general tone of the Festival films
has been fairly glum, which made the
French movie “La Vie De Chateau”
particularly welcome. This farcical
comedy, set in a down-at-heel country
house just before the Allied invasion
of Normandy, may be a minor effort
but it has a peculiarly Gallic grace and
humor, which has been absent from
French films for too long.
It is impossible not to think of Dr.
Kildare while watching “Red Beard,” a
Japanese movie telling, with a wealth
of sentimental detail, of a young,
opinionated doctor’s gradual realisation
that patients are human beings and
not just a collection of symptoms. I
can’t believe that Kurosawa really saw
this entertaining rubbish as “a parable
of the human condition,” whatever the
program says; but I wallowed happily
in the movie, which is expertly made
and compulsively watchable; embody-
ing every soap-opera cliche of wise old
doctors, lovers torn asunder, a soupcon
of nymphomania, even an engagingly
impish boy thief.
Skolimowski’s “The Barrier” has far
greater pretensions, but though I found
individual scenes exciting, the whole
thing struck me as being far too cal-
culated and self-conscious to be really
moving. In this parable of a young
man’s efforts to break out of the cage
of conformism, Skolimowski seems to
be more concerned with visual shocks
and deliberate originality of presenta-
tion than with the important subject he
has chosen; one feels that the images
would follow a similar pattern what-
ever he might be talking about.
Bresson’s “Au Hasard, Balthazar,” in
which a patient donkey serves as a
silent, uncomplaining commentator on
the sins of man, is a much more moving
film; but its poignancy and beauty are
counteracted by its basic pessimism and
despair.
I’ve been disappointed by the general
quality of the short films shown this
year. Most of them have been worthy
rather than exciting, and probably the
only ones I shall remember are “Ameri-
can Roulette,” Gershuny’s brilliantly
composed picture of a New Yorker’s
chilly reaction to the suicide of his
mistress; “How Do You Like Them
Bananas?”, Rogosin’s savagely funny
sketch of a distressingly enthusiastic
parson interrupting a parishioner in a
quiet afternoon’s drinking; and the
Commonwealth Film Board’s slight but
charming “Workout.” The cartoons,
generally a feature of the Festival, were
amusingly drawn, but with little intel-
lectual or emotional content.

Too late, too safe
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Incident At Vichy. Arthur Miller. Rus-
sell Street, Melbourne.
The Fighting Cock. Anouilh. St. Mar-
tin’s, Melbourne.
MILLER MARRIES MONROE: We
couldn’t have been more surprised, and
by all acounts, including his own, it came
as a shock to Arthur as well. Apart from
the film-script for “The Misfits” Miller
wrote nothing during the years with
Marilyn. But after her death he un-
veiled “After the Fall,” a play ostensibly
about his dear departed but in which
Miller spent most of the. time parading
a peacock conscience. It was so bad
that it made his other plays suspect.
Miller, it seemed, saw himself as a last
bastion of integrity in a world of
compromise: suddenly the heroes of “All
my Sons” and “The Crucible” looked
like self-portraits. “After the Fall”
looked like the death of a playwright.
Now, 20 years after creating Willy
Loman, Miller has made an attempt to
establish new credentials. Returning to
a subsidiary theme in “After the Fall”
he considers our collective guilt for
“the final solution,” implying in some
introductory notes that he is also con-
cerned with his audience’s ultimate
responsibility for the agonies of Harlem
and Vietnam.
A dozen Jews —and an Austrian noble
—are rounded up in Vichy in 1942.
While waiting to be examined by a
Professor of Racial Studies, they discuss
their predicament. First they are hope-
ful of release: then they resign them-
selves to the idea of labor camps.
Finally they are informed of the ovens
that await them, and we watch and
listen as they struggle to comprehend
this vast obscenity.
As the victims are carted off for their
“examination” the play becomes in-
creasingly centred on the dialogue be-
tween the Austrian noble and a young
French psychiatrist, but as with the play
itself —for all its magnitude of theme —
no new dimension of understanding
emerges. The play is a dutiful humanist
catechism from an intelligent writer, but
nothing more.
From a new writer or a younger
Miller, “Incident At Vichy” would
have been a commendable play. But
from the author of “Death Of A Sales-
man” it is too late and too safe.
Ogilvie’s production is efficient in
formal terms, but strangely shallow.
Robin Ramsay’s aristocratic Austrian
and George Whaley’s psychiatrist were
eloquent as viewpoints, but unconvinc-
ing as men. Michael Duffield as a
Marxist railway worker, David Turn-

bull as an emotional painter, and
Dennis Olsen as an actor sustaining
himself with theatrical disciplines
were the only members of the cast who
seemed to be at Vichy at all.
Richard Prin’s setting a stairway,
a catwalk, some girders, and a shed
was chilling.
“The Fighting Cock” is the eighth
Anouilh play St. Martin’s has tackled,
and I remember their previous produc-
tions with pleasure. A flippant, elegant
old conjurer, Anouilh usually gives St.
Martin’s an opportunity to do what
they do best: to mount a decorative,
light, and uncommitted production.
But “The Fighting Cock” lets them
down badly. The play’s comedy is awk-
ward and uncertain and its narrative
clouded. It concerns an aging general
of vaguely Gaullist values who rages
against “the Maggotts,” who are
allegedly undermining the spirit of his
nation. Most of his dialogue is of the
sort found on the Andrew Jones hit
record, but if Anouilh is a little scath-
ing about the militarist’s values he is
far more critical of “the Maggotts,”
who are represented (significantly) by
a young man with a passion for avant-
garde theatre.
Monica Maughan gives the best per-
formance of the night as an oversexed
spinster, while Jeffrey Hodgson gives
the worst as the Maggott.
Fast and loose

For the rest, the three acts -—■ 194
Officers’ Mess, 1956 Deb Party, 19° b


Suicide Sanctuary —really amount to no
ore than variations on a drawing-
room theme. In this production, what
the script lacks in cogency is made
in broadly conceived characterisa-
tion and a lot of fast but loose business.
John Edmund directed and acts in
the pl a y- b ooms i* l as a whisky-
sodden colonel, then as a cockney mil-
lionaire, finally as a gas-meter reader
cum social worker, and it is his domin-
ance of the stage that sets the pace,
tone, and pitch, to the extent that the
rest of the cast plays up to him, scurries
after him, rather than acts with him.
Xhe exception is Robert Alexander,
whose performance is superbly in coun-
ter-point to Edmund’s. He plays the
completely self-effacing English man
who finds that his life is unhappily
running out of control.
I think that perhaps Mr. Alexander
may have felt the same thing about
the play. The first and second acts are
stock English comedy, and quite tightly
written. Unfortunately, the first act
hardly relates to the plot at all, such
as it is, and the third act collapses
completely from an accumulated weight
of unreasonable farce.
Television
Lawson spirit
By FRANK ROBERTS
HAVE THE INFERENCES of ratings
(popularity) spilled over among the pro-
fessional critics who voted “McGooley”
the best TV show, above many excellent
Australian documentary and public
affairs programs, in the Henry Lawson
Festival Awards? It’s an improving
show, but I can remember better during
the past year. However, it was a clear-
cut award, with one statuette; and not,
like the prose and verse contests, re-
quiring 11 bronze pieces for six awards.
I won one of them but saved the organi-
sers some embarrassment by my absence,
both as to the statuette and in having
an unrecognised, uninvited TV critic
turn up for a prose award, with his
workaday self asking odd questions.
Ratings aside, a critics’ vote for
“McGooley” is no recommendation for
Australian TV, or for the Australian
spirit of the Lawson Festival, unless there
is some misreading of who the Aus-
tralian people are, now. “McGooley”
is an amusing folly. It is not, surely, any
reflection of Lawson’s emotional “what
the land I love might be,” nor anyone
else’s. An award for the “best” should
be for the best, and we are doing a lot
better than this.
In documentaries and public affairs
programs, Australian television is usually
good, and often very good, although the
craft of well-written commentary escapes
ns, so far. This was in evidence by con-
b_ast last week, when “Changing
Matilda” was shown again and the sharp,
crackling narration, written and spoken
by visiting Americans, was a model.
The next improvement we need is in
the more serious side of drama. The
ABC has begun a new “Playhouse”
series, so far showing in Melbourne but
not in Sydney, and this is the white
hope for 1967. Unless the ABC can find
more and better dramatists this year it
could profitably lock its drama team in
a darkroom and force them to watch last
week’s BBC television dramatisation of
“Stephen D.” It was an “illustration” of
parts of two works by James Joyce rather
than a dramatisation, but with excellent
actors and lighting, which gave the tele-
vision images a Dutch-master quality. If
drama fails them, they might find the
answer in Australian prose “illustra-
tions.” I would rather watch those than
half-baked “Playhouse” episodes.
Music
Rich and rare
By PAUL FROLICH
Helen Watts, contralto. Town Hall,
Sydney.
HELEN WATTS is one of those rare
artists whose engagement truly reflects
glory on the ABC. Described as a
Welsh contralto, she is not audibly
Welsh. Her English is beautifully
enunciated, her Scottish grandly burred,
and her German exemplary. Despite
her contralto range, one is tempted to
think of her rather as a mezzo, as even
her lowest notes are delicate rather
than rich and dark. She is still a very
young singer and it is quite possible
that, in time, her voice may acquire
those darker contralto characteristics
which were Kathleen Ferrier’s glory.
Miss Watts’ programming was
exemplary. The night I heard her, she
sang works by Purcell, Britten, Haydn,
and Schumann, with some slighter con-
tributions by Howells and Warlock.
The juxtaposition of Purcell and Britten,
the two greatest composers England has
produced, is always a suitable one and
was advance proof of the singer’s in-
telligence and taste. She opened the
recital with a large and florid Purcell
song from “Don Quixote,” followed by
his masterpiece, “Music for a While,” in
a near-perfect interpretation.
One of the evening’s major events
was the Haydn cantata “Arianna a
Naxos,” a virtually unknown work of
great beauty and power, superbly well
sung. Although the piano arrangement
lacked the quality of Haydn’s own great
keyboard writing, it was brilliantly
played by John Champ, an uncommonly
sensitive and compliant accompanist
throughout the evening. When she
came to Schumann, Miss Watts devi-
ated from the usual pattern of “Frauen-
liebe” and, instead, gave the composer’s
final song cycle, the “Poems of Queen
Mary Stuart,” songs of very great
beauty which are indeed rarely heard.
The second part of the recital was
English and distinguished by excellent
performances of Britten’s “Charm of
Lullabies” and four of his folk-soqg
arrangements.
Films
Marginally good
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Quiller Memorandum. Director,
Michael Anderson.
The Twenty-Fifth Hour. Director,
Henri Verneuil.
“THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM”
is remarkable chiefly for its inessentials
—the subtle, bluish color photography,
an attractive musical score by John
Barry; essentially it is very much the
mixture as before, served up com-
petently but without any great indi-
viduality.
The opening sequence is striking —.
a man walks down a dark and shuttered
street with no sound but the echoes of
his own footsteps, only to be shot dead
when he enters a phone booth. But the
movie slows down and loses its grip
when Quiller arrives in Berlin to take
over from the dead agent in the search
for a resurgent Nazi group.
Anderson’s direction is extremely
derivative; there are hints of “The
Third Man” in his effort to create a
sinister city as setting for his plot;
the understated British humor of Alec
Guinness and George Sanders recalls
“The Thirty-Nine Steps”; there are
attempts at the melancholy disillusion-
ment of “The Spy Who Came In From
The Cold.” This last hardly comes off,
for George Segal always looks a tough,
opportunistic young man who’d hardly
be disillusioned so easily.
In “The Twenty-Fifth Hour,” the
impact of its tragic story and of An-
thony Quinn’s beautiful performance is
largely dissipated by the romantic un-
reality of Verneuil’s direction. It’s about
a slow-witted Rumanian farmer, who,
at the war’s beginning, is wrongfully
sent by a spiteful petty official to a
labor camp for Jews, spends the war
being shuttled from one camp to an-
other, and is finally—still without in the
least understanding of what’s happening
—tried as a war criminal.
This bleak story of an obscure casu-
alty of war demands black-and-white,
but Verneuil has chosen to photograph
it in color so pretty that even forced
labor camps look decorative. Even a
remarkably distinguished cast —people
like Michael Redgrave and Alexander
Knox turn up in small parts —can’t
make much out of characters who are
mostly cardboard figures.

When it’s shivering cold and your office becomes an
igloo, your factory little Antarctica, your
staff slows down. That’s bad. Bad for production
and bad for profits. What to do? Insulate with
SISALATION heat-reflecting aluminium
foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation keeps winter out and slashes
fuel bills up to 40%. It also makes summers 15
degrees cooler. Think what the extra comfort means
in terms of improved productivity. Everyone works
better because they’re comfortable and happy.
Install fire-resistant Sisalation 450 in new or existing
buildings, in the roof and walls and it will work for
you 24 hours a day without pay. Not only will it
reflect radiant heat, but it protects you from leaking
roofs and storm damage because it’s tough, weather-
proof. Left exposed as a ceiling surface its high
reflectivity improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match.
It’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for optimum strength and durability.
A proven method of efficient insulation, Sisalation
450 is used extensively in factories, schools, ware-
houses, and in cold stores operating at sub-zero tem-
peratures.

A triumph for the Nauruans:
realism on phosphate
FARMERS FACE yet another increase
in costs with the negotiating triumph the
Nauruans achieved in Canberra last
week. These dusky South Sea islanders
realised their 3000 island population
was unable to turn up the expertise
needed for the sophisticated process of
international negotiations, so they very
sensibly bought it Philip Shrapnel
and Co. for their economic advice,
Eric White for PR, and Professor J.
Davidson, of the ANU, for political
and legal help. The last was perhaps
the most amusing. Professor Davidson,
as Professor of Pacific History and as a
member of the Nauru delegation, is
Bagging wealth from Nauru
making history as well as having the
opportunity of studying it extraordin-
arily closely.
So far they have not achieved satis-
faction on the political side, the Aus-
tralian Government wanting to retain
control over defence and foreign affairs.
UN pressure seems likely to lead to
concessions on these remaining points.
But the financial arrangements are re-
solved—to the great advantage of the
Nauruan people. Their royalty will rise
from $1.75 to $4.50 a ton, and over a
period of three years they will buy the
Phosphate Commission. At the end of
that time they will be free to sell to
whomever they like at whatever price
they can get. The whole deal looks like
guaranteeing the islanders an income
equivalent to $4OOO per capita, which
will put them up with Kuwait, on the
Persian Gulf, in terms of income per
person.
All this seems very costly for us and
generous to the Nauruans. But the
former situation was utterly indefens-
ible. There we were in there as colonial
rulers, setting our own terms. The
only fair price is the price which is
gained on a world market in open
competition, as our Government has
now conceded. So rather than despair-
ing at the rise in costs, it is more accu-
rate to see it as an adjustment to a
realistic level. We have, in fact, been
subsidised in the past.
Japan
Curse of politeness
AUSTRALIAN companies doing busi-
ness with the Japanese have often found
it difficult to know exactly what has
been agreed on despite hours of negotia-
tions. For the Japanese, according to
this month’s excellent survey on Japan
by Norman Macrae of the “Economist”
(extracts from which are printed on
pages 55 and 57 of this issue of The
Bulletin), suffer from a dreadful com-
plaint—the curse of politeness. He says
that in almost every business deal in
Japan there is liable to be an instinc-
tive search for initial verbal com-
promises; later, when the chips are
down, these are likely to prove not to
have been real compromises at all, be-
cause the Japanese are generally
damned if they are going to give any-
body an unnecessary advantage over
whatever is the particular inbred group
—whether it be their own company,
their company’s business grouping, or
the greater “company of Japan.”
“There is a danger, frankly, of some
colossal commercial misunderstandings
as this now very major industrial
country of Japan moves nearer to the
centre of the world’s economic stage —
carrying with it some very un-Western
traditions of legal, contractual, account-
ing, bureaucratic, and administrative
practices. Those who deal with Japan
would be wise to realise that an initial
‘yes, yes’ in response to a purely verbal
approach would be recognised by most
Japanese as an expression of courtesy
rather than of commitment; that Jap-
anese phrases entered in the dictionary
as meaning ‘very interesting, but . . .’
could more accurately be translated as
‘not on your Nellie.’ They should
recognise that even when an apparent
written agreement has been concluded
with a Japanese firm, the Japanese Gov-
ernment often has the right to intervene
and alter it in Japan’s favor (because
of bureaucracy’s almost open-ended
right of nagging and interference).”
Stockbrokers
First-hand study
THIS WEEK AND last, a group of 29
Australian stockbrokers has been on
a round-Australia “study tour,” mainly
of mining developments, so they will
know at first hand what they are buying
(or selling) for their customers. They
are a pretty impressive-looking bunch,
representing a fair cross section of
broking houses and under the leader-
ship of the chairman of the Sydney
Stock Exchange, Mr. Ken Polking-
horne.
With places like Gladstone’s alumina
plant, Mt. Morgan’s copper mine, Mt.
Isa, Mary Kathleen’s uranium, BHP’s
Groote Eylandt manganese and Yampi
Sound iron ore (and CRA’s and Con-
solidated Goldfields’ iron ore, too),
Ampol’s oil, Swan Brewery’s beer, West-
ern Titanium’s and Kathleen Invest-
ments’ beach sands, and GMK’s gold,
it seems a fair bet that there could be
some heightened interest in these com-
panies from clients of these brokers
when they get back behind their desks.
In fact, there already has been. The
day the brokers got to Gladstone, CRA
shares rose by 12 cents and added
another 40 cents the next day; Mary
Kathleen Uranium and Kathleen In-
vestments both jumped substantially the
day the brokers had down for their
visit.
Seriously enough, there is no doubt
that a visit like this could well arouse
a great deal of investment interest in
the companies running these projects;
those who have a fair idea of brokers’
likely reactions to these developments
could probably make a few dollars by
anticipating their moves.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Eleven months of the 1966-67 wool
selling season, to May, have brought in $656,846,818
mildly beneath the corresponding 1965-66 period’s
$661,647,334; the full year’s proceeds will also be a little
lower. A 4 percent higher clip is yielding less because of a
price dip; average greasy values for May stood at 47.85
cents a lb., against 50.29 cents in May, 1966.
Overseas shipowners have been requested by the Acting
Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, to put off a 5 percent lift
in freight rates between Australia and Europe. Higher
Europe-Australia charges are already in operation.
Larger royalties agreed for Nauruan phosphate will send
its price for Australian fertiliser makers up by 50 cents a
ton from July 1.
For the markets: It was a hope-laden nickel week on
Australian share markets and some rather distant relations
were dragged out for display. Elsewhere, other miners were
generally sound, while leaders brought some succor to the
industrials, too; the all ordinaries and investment indexes
both advanced.
London industrials edged back toward the close, after
being buoyed up by better trade figures and Rhodesian
possibilities ... A highly selective rise distinguished Wall
Street; the Middle East still echoes.
For companies: Undeterred by the flightier aspects
of business life, that half-forgotten old steelmaster BHP
calmly went ahead and increased output during its 1966-67
year; steel ingot production was lifted nine percent and
pig iron 12 percent, steel actually totalling 5,961,000 tons.
The point-counterpoint of the takeover world did not
lack of complications . . . Under siege from the Ameri-
can Mars Inc., directors of Mac. Robertson (Australia) have
been more impressed with a partial bid (covering 50 percent
of the ordinaries) by Cadbury-Fry-Pascall Pty. and recom-
mend it though the two offers “are not mathematically
comparable”; profits are to drop further in 1966-67 amid
“often irrational” competition . . . Industrial Equity could
only obtain 74,000 of a required 624,000 shares in Stack
and Co., so its offer is withdrawn; Stack expects to lose
about $300,000 in the current year.
A reorganisation of Consolidated Press is to be accom-
plished by allowing Television Corporation Ltd. to acquire
the operating Australian Consolidated Press; TV Corp. will
issue 6.1 m. $1 shares at $3.50 to Consolidated Press, thus
valuing the deal at $21.35m.
CSR’s 1966-67 profit retreat certainly was “not large,”
as directors foretold; earnings eased from $12,913,130 to
$12,843,229 on higher tax and depreciation, to give a 21.7
percent earning rate.
Miners appeared relatively sedate ... Yet King Island
Scheelite reported better profits in six months to April;
higher tungsten prices overcame lower ore grades . . . Rutile
and Zircon Mines (Newcastle), jointly owned by Coff’s
Harbour Rutile and Peko-Wallsend, should earn some
$695,000 for 1966-67, against the previous year’s $610,000;
1968 may slip back a little . . . Cleveland Tin will be
in commission by the end of 1967; a 20-cent call makes
the shares 40 cents paid . . . Kathleen Investments can
export uranium from its Andersons Lode, “subject to
approved price and safeguards.”
Earnings of farm equipment maker Massey-Ferguson
sprang from $306,000 to $833,000 in the half-year to April
. . . The parents of FNCB-Waltons, First National City
Bank of New York and Waltons Ltd., will each lend the
finance house ssm.
MEN AND MATTERS
ONE ESSENCE of the annual wage
exercise is to try not to put noses at
the Trades Hall and Manufacturers’
House in Melbourne too far out of
joint. But the Arbitration Commission
never escapes caustic comments from
both quarters when the result comes
out. If wages are raised, it is never by
nearly enough for the men in Lygon
Street, and even if the increase is ever
so little the chaps down in St. Kilda
Road say it will ruin them.
This year “Mick” Jordan, the
moderate Trades Hall Council secre-
tary, looking more to the future, was,
if anything, a bit milder in his re-
proaches than Langford Waite, now in
his second year as president of the
manufacturers’ body. This comparison
could prove deceptive, because Mr. Jor-
dan’s remark that the introduction of
the total wage is a retrograde step
which would react violently in any
future attempt to fix wages on a just
and proper basis clearly has a big kick
in it. Naturally, Mr. Waite welcomed
the total wage triumph, but he was
gravely concerned about the damage he
thought the dollar rise would do here
and now to prices and the economy in
general.
Although they have long been on
opposite sides of the industrial fence,
these two launched into their distin-
guished and lively careers from State
schools. Jordan,
the younger by
seven years (he’s
54), went to the
Faraday Street
school in Carlton
(where he was
born) to be org-
aniser of the Tex-
tile Work e r s’
Union and sub-
sequently (1947-
48) president of
the THC. Waite,
also born in Mel-
bourne, is from South Melbourne Tech.
His industrial career began in a work-
shop and he is now managing director
of Qualos Machine Tools Pty. Ltd.
AT 55, JACOB van Raalte, chairman
of Raalte Holdings, the “Linda” electric
blanket people soon to float under the
aegis of A. C. Goode & Co., has
achieved just about the ultimate in
migrant success stories. He left little
Liechtenstein 14 years ago with his wife,
Anna, to make his fortune in the
antipodes (New Zealand first of all).
This he did and leaving his son Abra-
ham (“Bram”) out here to reap the
family harvest, is now back for good in
his old home European town commut-
ing from there to Melbourne for the
firm’s monthly board meetings!
“Bram” van Raalte
Langford Waite
“Mick” Jordan
The father got the family electric
blanket business off the ground from a
humble domestic start in a house in
Wellington to be a two-factory affair
in the north island and the biggest
heating-cable maker in New Zealand.
It was the son “Bram,” now only 29,
who, in 1959, launched it on this side
of the Tasman and, working long hours
and living tough at a grass roots site at
Glenroy, drove it with all manner of
electrical ware attached into the big
Australian industrial time.
Though he came off a Wellington
technical school drawing board with a
diploma in electrical engineering, as
managing director Bram van Raalte s
market penetration with “Linda in
Australia has been a promotor’s dream.
So has his preparation for listing.

THE
CROESUS TOUCH
Liberal principle
and finance
for development
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MR. McMAHON was put on the spot
in question time following his recent
address at the American Chamber of
Commerce luncheon in Melbourne.
Somebody asked him to define the
Federal Government’s own frontiers in
the development task. His answer was
brief and unequivocal. It would bend
over backwards to pave the way for
private enterprise to prosecute projects,
but wouldn’t cross the public sector
boundary to take part in them on its
own account.
It is intriguing that someone in the
local American camp should be wonder-
ing if the Government was contem-
plating direct financing of development
projects, especially as the Treasurer had
emphasised in his address that the
essence of the proposed Bankers’
Development Refinance Corporation
lies in its capital marshalling potential
in the private sector, not on its Gov-
ernment backing. Mr. McMahon had
given no hint of the Government put-
ting any money into it, even if Reserve
Bank backing is probably the next best
thing.
On the other hand, if, as McMahon
said explicitly, “strong emphasis would
be placed on strengthening Australian
ownership and control in the develop-
ment of natural resources, more especi-
ally minerals, oil, and natural gas,” a
reasonable inference might be that, with
the institutions here fairly fully com-
mitted, the only other local source of
capital on the scale required for big
development finance as alternative to
overseas money would be the Federal
Government. If the latter can provide
funds for clearing the brigalow country,
"By not for developing mineral
resources?
Of course it will be said that, as
Federal finances stand at the moment,
the Government’s present resources are
fully or even overcommitted, that it is
already scraping the barrel to find the
necessary money to provide, inter alia,
for basic public sector works essential
as a background to the development
being done by private enterprise, and
that it has nothing big to spare. It
could also be argued that there is too
much still to be done in the public
sector backyard, not only in physical
investment in, say, transport and com-
munications but also in social invest-
ment, to permit excursions into a field
which up to now has been mainly fer-
tilised by private finance.
Perhaps with the imminent Loan
Council meeting and another tight
Budget coming up, Mr. McMahon was
implying all this in his answer, yet it
seemed to me he was showing more
concern for the possible breach of a
good Liberal principle than worrying
about the feasibility of the Government
going directly into development. Con-
sidering the many good Liberal prin-
ciples that have been broken by the
Federal Government in the economic
sphere in the past 17 years, I don’t
know why he should gainsay participa-
tion on principle. Anyway, with such
tremendous opportunities for develop-
ment about and the lion’s share of
them going to foreigners, this is a prin-
ciple the Government could usefully
forsake. At the very least it is diffi-
cult to reconcile it with the forceful
support the Government is now giving
to the maximisation of local equity
participation and the retention of
control over our national resources.
To an outsider, the question of prin-
ciple is a lot less interesting than the
feasibility one. The nub of the latter
looks to be whether, by increasing taxa-
tion or by some other means, the Gov-
ernment can find the necessary money
to participate on a scale which would
obviate the need for a significant slice
of the foreign capital now being applied
to development here. Although, as the
Institute of Public Affairs pointed out
in a recent release, the Australian public
isn’t at all keen on cutting its con-
sumption to free more resources for
development, the scope for raising
special taxes, be they for development,
defence, education, or some other
national requirement, has barely been
touched, let alone exhausted. We used
to hear a good deal about the possi-
bilities for such taxes from Sir Douglas
Copland and more recently from Sir
Henry Bolte, but the Government just
goes on with the tired old general ones
whose familiarity breeds contempt. If
we had a few special taxes for special
objects, it is just possible people could
get excited about paying them, like the
Israelis did recently when slugged
another 10 percent to pay to keep the
Arabs at bay. If the Government put
on a special development tax and gave
the assurance that this would be used
to give all Australians an equity stake
in some of the massive projects now in
train, the response would squash any

qualms it might have over breaching a
principle.
If the Treasurer was ruling out dir-
ect Government participation, physi-
cal, financial, or otherwise, in projects
in circumstances where local private
capital has to be supplemented in such
large wads by overseas capital to get
the development job done, he could
hardly fail to be aware of the strains
being built into the balance of pay-
ments by the process. Going on the
rising cost of servicing overseas invest-
ment here, the need for new thinking
on the Government’s role in develop-
ment is getting urgent. Against last
year’s record s6o9m. net capital inflow
had to be offset earnings on foreign
investment in this country of $375m.,
and, as sllsm. of those earnings was
ploughed back, this still means that
about half of the net capital inflow
was required to service existing foreign
investment. From this it is clear that,
if capital inflow falls from last year’s
record level (and we know it has, quite
substantially), even at last year’s ser-
vicing figure the proportion of the net
inflow required for servicing it will be
higher than last year. Further, because
the new capital coming in will also
require servicing (in the case of U.K.
capital in the past year, at the ultra-
generous rate as demanded by the Wil-
son Government), the proportion
negatived by servicing it will be higher
again.
Projecting the arithmetic, at some
stage we reach the point where the
servicing charge on existing foreign
investment exceeds the annual net
inflow of overseas capital. Even if this
projection has been made before and
used as the peg of their warnings
against excessive capital inflow by Pro-
fessor Wheelwright and others, it is
worth repeating in the context of Mr.
McMahon’s aversion to direct Govern-
ment participation in development
projects.


Risen Sun
Japan: a survey of Australia’s
biggest customer
JAPAN has become the greatest practi-
cal research laboratory of economic
growth in our time, but a laboratory
whose remarkable implications are be-
ing hidden from most of us in the
west by a fog of incomprehension.
There are for the ordinary western
businessman a number of built-in irri-
tants in this sometimes maddening
country arising partly from its soci-
ology, from its youth as a major in-
dustrial and commercial nation, from
the bureaucratic traditions of its merito-
cratic mandarins, and from some rough
gratings in the country’s extraordinary,
but in all major matters unprecedently
successful, economic planning system.
Japan is the fastest growing economy
in the world; it has 100 million people,
and within a short time they will have
a west-European standard of life; im-
ports are certainly going to rise above
their present eight to ten percent of
gross national product; its inefficient
distribution system is eventually going
to improve.
Since the beginning of 1962, the real
gross national product of Japan has
increased by nearly 50 percent, even
although more than two of these five
years have been what the Japanese call
a “recession period.” There is thus a
continuing economic miracle in the
country, and it has been proceeding
on three separate levels at once. These
three levels are (a) Japan’s light indus-
tries, hitherto the stepchildren of her
forward surge; (b) the superboom in-
dustries of the 19505, which by all laws
of logic should now be suffering from
chronic over-expansion; and (c) the
new science-based industries, the switch
to which is now beginning to gather
pace.
If Japan is to continue to grow at her
recent fantastic pace, she will need to
beep on discovering new growth indus-
tries, and ones with an export content.
Rightly or wrongly, there is confidence
in the country that motor-cars are
such an industry; this is because they
are one of the last of the fields of the
old “industrial revolution,” where she
still has leeway to make up. But the
new international growth industries of
tomorrow seem very likely to be
scientifically based” rather than “in-
dustrially based” industries.
Is Japan going to continue straight
ol t up to reach a full western-European
standard of life? My guess: yes, but
with rather more frequent interruptions
and supposed internal financial crises,
whose importance Japanese commen-
tators themselves will greatly exagger-
ate at the time. There are two main
Problems ahead. The first is the balance
of payments: If the country’s rate of
private equipment investment is going
to surge up by another 15-20 percent
in 1967, and if this is going to be piled
on top of other forms of expenditure
that were increased during the threat-
ened recession precisely because private
investment seemed to be wilting, there
must be some danger of Japan’s inter-
national payments slipping into the
red.
Because of the surging, successful,
and continuing change in the structure
of their exports, the Japanese reckon
that when total world trade in manu-
factures increases by one percent, they
can expect their exports to increase by
two percent. But this does not solve
all their problems. Their difficulty is
Automation at Yawata Steel
that a one percent increase in their
gross national product also leads to a
more than proportional increase in their
imports; not quite to a two percent
increase in imports, but getting near to
it. So whenever Japan’s rate of internal
growth in money terms considerably
exceeds the rate of growth in total
world trade in manufactures, the
country is liable to run into balance
of payments difficulties. Since world
trade in manufactures has recently been
roaring along with annual increases
around five to nine percent, that might
not seem a grave difficulty to a country
like Britain. But it has been a major
problem for Japan.
It has been met by a periodic giddy
swerving into stop-go policies, but of
a most sophisticated kind. When trouble
threatens, a sharp and sudden credit
squeeze by the Bank of Japan can
usually send Japanese exports soaring.
The reason for this lies largely in the
“permanent tight money situation,” the
fact that this is an economy run so
largely on lOUs. When the squeeze is
imposed, “paper gets longer”; the
lOUs, with which most domestic pur-
chases as between enterprises are made,
may swell from a quite normal 90
days to “pregnancy notes” of nine or
ten months’ duration; moreover, at such
times, the unofficial discount rate on
such pregnancy paper may soar to 15
or 20 percent or more. In these circum-
stances, an export delivery, which will
be paid for far more quickly on a sight
bill, becomes a much more desirable
delivery for enterprises (which are by
now desperate for money) to make.
All the tedious arguments about
whether Japanese firms sometimes
“dump” exports in such conditions be-
come quite meaningless when this factor
of quicker payment is understood.
THE SECOND PROBLEM Japan
faces is if the superboom industries of
the late 1950 s are now starting to in-
vest voraciously again, might they not
run into another bout of over-invest-
ment and create another ill-placed mass
of excess capacity in precisely the
wrong industries? On this point, some
Japanese economists this year did sound
really worried. We come now to a fas-
cinating question: how great are the
dangers of Japan’s system of adminis-
trative guidance breaking down, now
that the industries it seeks administra-
tively to guide are such very big ani-
mals, who increasingly feel their own
oats?
The great wave of the superboom
had filled up the homes of Japan with
consumer durables more swiftly and
fully, in a greater sudden transforma-
tion of a way of life of a people, than
had ever been known before in history.
According to recent official surveys,
over 94 percent of the urban homes of
Japan now have television sets, over
62 percent refrigerators, over 75 per-
cent electric washing machines. These
are much higher figures than are usual
in the more affluent homes of western
Europe; and remember that the homes
of Japan into which these gleaming
machines have been stuffed are often
inadequate two- or three-room apart-
ments or wooden buildings with an
occupancy rate in Tokyo of well over
one person a room.
The main industries, which some
even of Japan’s expansionist-minded
economists fear may be about to over-
invest, are: steel, cement, fertilisers,
possibly synthetic textiles (this last had
an unexpectedly bleak experience in
Japan’s so-called recession of 1964-65,
as ICI and others ought to have noted).
THE JAPANESE LIKE to say that
theirs is an unplanned, free enterprise
economy. But, in our western terms,
it isn’t. The ultimate responsibility for
industrial planning, for deciding in
which new directions Japan’s burgeon-
ing industrial effort should try to go,
and for fostering and protecting busi-
ness as it moves in those directions, lies
with the Government. And big Japanese

JAPAN’S ECONOMIC policy is based
jnore closely on more scientific and
Illo re numerate analyses of desirable
industrial trends than is the economic
policy of any other country in the
wor ld. In the civil service departments
in Tokyo are some of the most brilliant
young men in Japan. The brightest
graduates from Japan’s universities
still throng to get into the civil service,
and for a good reason: it is the golden
roa d to the top not only (at a relatively
early age) in the civil service itself but
at a later age in industry and politics.
Japan’s flat-out emphasis on rule by
a scholastic meritocracy is the first
mechanism that has helped to drive its
tremendous industrial revolution up
through the ground. Seventy percent of
Japanese children (versus under 40
percent of British ones) now stay on at
school to around or past the age of
18; some 16 percent (versus under
ten percent in Britain) go on to
college or university, and the number
is rising fast. In about five years’ time,
aided admittedly by the huge drop in
the birth rate after 1950 which will
temporarily reduce the proportion of
teenagers to early twenty-year-olds,
some 30 percent of Japan’s new young
entrants to the labor market will have
college or university degrees.
The next advantage of the present-
day Japanese economy, compared with
Britain’s, is that, at any rate in the
larger firms, these generally better-
educated young workers in its teeming
new factories are having a greater
weight of new and more modern
machinery being installed behind them
than are their contemporaries in Brit-
tain. In one entirely sensible respect,
Japan is the most capitalist-minded
country in the world today. There is a
close correlation between the rate of
capital investment and the rate of
economic growth all over the world.
Japan is top of both columns.
Moreover, it has kept up this high
rate of investment even although the
marginal productivity of newly intro-
duced capital equipment to those who
install it has fallen in recent years. It
is therefore important to realise that
a large part of the investment program
is not free-market-induced in our west-
ern sense, but is much more deliberately
arranged. This “blind rush for indus-
trial gadgetry” is increasingly attacked
by some visiting American business
efficiency experts with the snort that
“these people must be riding for a
fall.”
An increasing part of Japan’s high
rate of investment is what can best
be called “forced draught investment”
induced by Government policies of deli-
berate expansionism. So the next ques-
tlon arises: how on earth can the
Japanese induce forced draught in-
vestment on the present scale, pushing
die ratio of investment to national in-
come to twice Britain’s and America’s
ratios, without running into massive
mternal inflation?
In crude national accounting terms,
the main and slightly misleading ans-
wers are that Japan can devote some
17 percent more of its national income
to productive investment than Britain
does because: (a) defence expenditure
takes only about one or two percent
of Japan’s national income, against six
to eight percent in Britain and America;
and (b) personal consumption in Japan
takes nearly ten percent less of national
income than it does here. The Japanese
are willing to put up with the forced
saving created by this forced invest-
ment with this mysterious system
that somehow obliges them, out of every
extra £1 they earn, to devote about 2/-
less than the people of other countries,
to enjoyable personal consumption
because at the same time the extra real
income in their pockets is increasing
so quickly. The real question is: why
is it increasing so quickly? The answer
is that, as national expenditure has
kept on increasing, real resources,
especially of labor, have kept on flowing
into more and more efficient forms of
utilisation in order to meet it.
JAPAN’S BANKING and credit sys-
tem is a very unorthodox system, run
by very orthodox-looking men. The
investment boom was financed by the
central bank creating money and hand-
ing it on to the commercial banks, who
then pumped it out to industrial firms.
Even today the average big Japanese
firm draws the apparently shocking pro-
portion of some 70 percent of its
finance from commercial bank loans

likely to show the right mixture of

From crude oil to
good oil:
the three Ms
I’LL BET THE Japanese are doing
a bit of feverish thinking as a result of
the Middle East crisis. They get 85
percent of their crude -oil from the
area and the threatened embargo by the
Arabs, if implemented, would have
really landed them in trouble. Perhaps
the result of this thinking will be to
step up exploration ventures in good
old stable Australia. This is, of course,
what Australian businessmen and poli-
ticians have been plugging for ever since
the last Middle East blow-up ten years
ago. Still, there is nothing like a
fright to stimulate a bit of action.
So much for crude oil. Now for the
good oil (or at least what I think is
the good oil). This week I am
attracted by three Ms Marrickville,
Millers, and McDonalds.
First of all Marrickville. In my un-
ending search for shares which I feel
have been “done wrong” by the market,
Marrickville looms high. I feel the
stock’s price is badly underrated. This
year’s profit will, I feel, be close to
last year’s level, despite the much-pub-
licised reduction in its margarine pro-
duction division. My reasons are two.
One is the fact (generally overlooked
or not known) that losses of around
$BOO,OOO incurred by the company’s
alginates plant are now available as
tax losses. This will considerably chop
down the year’s tax bill. Actually the
old company, Shell Aginates, has now
been renamed Marrickville Sales and
has taken over much of the group’s
distribution work. My other reason for
expecting a good profit this year is
Crago Stock Foods. A controlling in-
terest was acquired in this company last
November.
Next comes Millers. This company’s
profit and sales were both down in the
December half year. The problems were
coal-loading and tankers. Long disrup-
tions occurred to coal-loading activities
at Newcastle and heavy demurrage
costs were incurred. Both local and
overseas shipping was affected. The
setback was caused by the curtailment
of facilities on the docks during the
building of a new loading plant. These
inconveniences are now reported as
being almost over, and the company
will soon be happily packing off large
quantities of coal and eniovino- a
profits therefrom.
The other problem was the tankers
A few years ago, when the Govern
ment decided to give preference t
Australian carriers, Millers boueht
three tankers in order to take advantage
of the scheme. However, subsequent
rationalisation by the oil industry re
duced the number of ships required
As a result, Millers were forced to sell
one of their vessels and leave anothe-
sitting virtually idle in the harbor. The
position is now being resolved, and the
situation looks considerably brighter
One grey spot which is affecting the
price of the company’s stock j,
Millers’ stony silence about the terms
of the sale of its brewery division to
Tooheys. The deal is rumored as beine
a good one for Millers.
The last M is McDonald Industries
which is a recovery prospect. Un-
doubtedly this year’s profit will be
adversely affected by the inability of
the railroad from Frances Creek to
Darwin to handle adequately the iron-
ore cargoes in which the company i s
interested. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernment is currently getting down to
the job of putting the track into shape
and smooth sailing (or training) is ex-
pected soon. This is just as well, as
the Frances Creek Iron Mining Cor-
poration, of which McDonald is a 25
percent owner, has contracted to send
four million tons of ore from the area
over the next eight years. As well as
its 25 percent equity interest, McDonald
also holds the contract for the actual
mining and crushing of the ore from
the area and will eventually earn around
$250,000 annually from this contract.
While waiting for the railroad to be
straightened out and the iron-ore ven-
ture to get into high gear, McDonalds
will be helped along in the current year
by a sizable capital profit from the sale
of its Stabilisers interest to Mobil.
Priced at $0.63 the stock looks good.
During the week I sold Longreach
and Metropolitan Brick. Both deals
were profitable, but would have been
even more so if I had made the move
a week earlier. Still, that’s share biz.

Beware of partial takeovers

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
PARTIAL TAKEOVER bids are for
the birds. They just have not worked
here and there is no reason why they
should begin now in the Cadbury-
Mac. Robertson takeover deal. But that
does not mean that shareholders in
Mac. Robertsons should rush into the
unattractive Mars offer; they should
quite clearly reject both. For both
bids are ridiculous.
Not that Mac. Robertsons itself is
such a wonderfully run company, oi
that its prospects are astoundingly
bright. The simple realities are that
it is worth far more than the meagre
Mars offer of $1.75 a share (for shares
that sold two years ago for $2.40), and
has more chance of success outside the
smothering do-goodism of its Friends
at Cadburys who are offering $2.10 for
40 percent of the capital just to keep
the Yanks out. Right now, Mac. Rober-
tsons is down because it has been going
through an expensive relocation
program at the same time as the com-
fortable price agreements in the
chockies business have collapsed. But
because it is temporarily down is no
reason for it to be permanently out —
and certainly not at prices below $2.50
a share, which also happens to be its
net assets backing.
The facts of partial takeover offers
from overseas are something that every
Mac. Robertson shareholder should have
a good look at. The greatest exponents
of this art in Australia have been
American companies that have “done
the right thing” by allowing the Aus-
tralian shareholder to retain an interest
in companies they have acquired. The
experience of Australian investors who
have remained in such partnerships
with the Americans has been quite
dreadful. They provide a powerful
argument against encouraging Ameri-
cans to allow the locals a stake in U.S.
enterprise here; if what has happened
to these shareholders is a “gesture of
goodwill,” then we can do without it.
Look at these facts: Welded Products
went into partnership with the E. W.
Bliss Co. of the U.S., which acquired
its shares at 70 cents in April, 1964.
The shares went to 80 cents in 1965.
They are now only 38 cents, because
the company made a loss in the first
half of the current year and is paying
no dividend (after cutting its dividend
in the previous year). Borg-Warner’s
role in the old Coote and Jorgenson
group has been one of promise without
performance. True, the group was sick
when Borg-Warner took up 75 percent
of its capital at $1 par 11 years ago and
paid no dividends for another five
years. Then the dividend staggered up
to 6 percent for a few years before
being wiped out again last year. The
shares have slumped from $3.05 twc
years ago to $1.40.
The two chemical company partial
takeovers, for Australian Chemical
Holdings and Amalgamated Chemicals,
have both been flops. Australian Chemi-
cal Holdings was half-acquired by the

1964 for $2.50, and the shares went as
high as $2.70. The present price is
only $1.85 following a collapse of earn-
ings from 14 percent to 6.4 percent.
Continental Oil of the U.S. offered
$1.40 and acquired 73 percent of shares
in Amalgamated Chemicals in March
last year (they had been up around the
$1.60 mark the previous year). The
shares are now 51 cents. Cresco Fertil-
iser shares were worth $9.00 to W. R.
Grace, the U.S. fertiliser company, late
in 1965. Now, a one-for-three bonus
later, the shares are at $3.70 (equal to
about $4.93 on pre-bonus capital). This
means the shares are now about $1.50
below the price they held before the
takeover hoo-haa had pushed them up.
So the facts about partial takeovers
(all of them by U.S. companies) clearly
suggest that Australian shareholders
should press instead for shares in the
U.S. parent companies involved (if only
the Reserve Bank would agree).
It is absurd to look at GM-H and
say: “We should have a share in all
U.S. companies here.” Of course
GM-H is profitable, and so are the drug
companies and the mining groups. But
a lot of U.S. companies here are
badly managed, dull, and profitless.
And these seem to be the sort of U.S.
companies that the Australian public
is allowed a stake in. True, in the Mac.-
Robertson battle, it is the U.S. com-
pany making the complete takeover
offer (inadequate as it is) and a British
group making the partial one. But
the principle is the same and the par-
ticulars are even worse (with Cadbury’s
continuing in opposition to Mac.-
Robertsons and so clearly having no
interest in overstimulating Mac. Rober-
tsons as a competitor).
This sort of thing clearly demon-
strates the need for some sort of Gov-
ernment policy on foreign investment
i n Australia,
THE SUGGESTION made here a few
weeks ago that Kathleen Investments
was an interesting-looking stock at $2.50
has been followed by some strong buy-
ing that last week pushed the stock
up to the $3.18 mark. At last week’s
annual meeting the chairman and
managing director, Mr. Roy Hudson,
revealed that the Federal Government
had eased its export ban for Kathleen’s
“Andersons Lode” and would prob-
ably do so for Mary Kathleen Uranium,
too.
It now looks very much as if Mr.
Hudson will attempt to get a uranium
contract for Andersons as quickly as
possible—a move that would be dis-
tinctly embarrassing to CRA, which,
critics, complain, has not shown quite
the same enthusiasm for getting an
export contract for MKU (particularly
while its parent company RTZ is get-
ting uranium deals for its own Rio
Algom mines in Canada).
Mr. Hudson’s brand of politicking
could suggest that there may be some
more cheerful news from the CRA
group about uranium long before the
The Chartist says:
The recent share prices movements in PEKO-WALLSEND have “bullish” impli-
cations. This stock has been a reliable technical performer and since 1961 has moved
in a broad primary uptrend channel at a rate slightly exceeding 20 percent appre-
ciation per annum. A steeper 40 percent intermediate uptrend was followed until
early 1963, when a general sideways movement formed a consolidation pattern
until July, 1965, when the 40 percent intermediate uptrend was again resumed and
prices rose to a high point of $2.60 before this trend was broken. Once again
a continuation pattern formed and the rise to $2.80 on very high volume during
the past week suggests that prices could eventually rise to approximately the $3.80
Level. However, some short-term reaction could be expected and the situation
would only call for reassessment should prices fall below $2.30. Last sale price
on 13/6/67—52.71.

1970s —the years that Mr. Val Duncan
had mentioned in passing as “uranium
time” last time he visited the Aus-
tralian part of his RTZ empire.
THERE IS MORE in the BHP pro-
duction for 1966-67 than meets the eye
(and that does not depend on which
morning newspaper version of the rise
you believe). For the implications are
important not only for BHP (which
could have pushed up output even more
but for the six-week close-down of No. 1
blast furnace at Port Kembla for
repairs), but also for all the steel
merchants and semi-fabricators and
others whose profitability is so closely
tied in with the level of activity at
BHP.
For example, the rise for the year
in plate and strip production is clearly
one reason for the healthy look in
the price of John Lysaght shares, which
are now up around the $3.10 mark
(they were recommended here when
in the $2.705). But so far, there has
been very little reflection of these better
times on the shares of steel merchants
like William Adams and William
Atkins, both of which look fairly cheap
and yield more than 6 percent (Adams
at $2.04 to yield 6.1 percent and Atkins
at 96 cents to yield 6.5 percent).
Others in the business that should
be benefiting are J. Blackwood (which
will be discussed in detail next week
in Behind the Balance Sheets) and
McPhersons, along with the tin-can
makers. Tinplate production went up
considerably, so J. Gadsden and
Queensland Can should be improving,
even though Containers Ltd. is making
all the running in this industry at
present.
And for Brambles the implications of
more activity for its Breckett interest
should be cheerful.
But getting back to BHP: the market
at present seems to look on BHP as an
oil stock with some steel interests. The
latest news suggests that its steel acti-
vities alone could justify a great deal
of the recent rise in its price.
WHILE BRITISH money was helping
pump up the price of Western Mining,
Great Boulder, Hampton Areas, and
other “nickel stocks” last week, Aus-
tralian money was making the return
journey on the same mission. The
stock being bought was Hampton Pro-
perties Ltd., London-listed and tern-
porarily overlooked in the rush for the
more obvious doors into the nickel
boom.
Buyers were lining up this stock
against the market capitalisation of
Great Boulder and Hampton Areas—
Great Boulder because the two stocks
are linked by the same piece of ground.
Location 45 on Hampton Plains;
Hampton Areas because this stock has
an area of similar potential in the new
nickel belt of the West.
The Great Boulder tie-up was
strengthened by word that drilling
would start within three weeks, and
that the previously announced right to
explore “pending final execution of the
agreement” would entail Hampton Pro-
perties getting 20-25 percent equity in
Great Boulder’s developments, but with-
out putting in for exploration and
capital costs. Such a partnership would
be more like a 50-50 arrangement, in
fact, because of the amount entailed
in exploring and developing; but,

Hampton Properties’ shares at $7. They
were half this price at the beginning
of last week.
The Hampton Areas market capi-
talisation at that time was $lO million,
and a similar evaluation of Hampton
Properties would make their limited
number of shares worth $2O each.
Although Hampton Areas has proven
nickel and a firm agreement, there
seemed little reason to doubt that
Hampton Properties’ potential was at
least its equal.
Hampton Areas had reached agree-
ment with Western Mining before the
nickel fever had become an epidemic.
Also, Location 45 is not the only iron
Hampton Properties has in the fire;
they have a tentative agreement also
on nearby Location 50 with Interna-
tional Nickel Corporation.
The Melbourne market
Against the trend
with builders
BUILDING AND construction stocks
are quite out of favor at the moment.
For those who like to go against the
trend, there are some very interesting
propositions in this sector of the mar-
ket. Two Melbourne-based construction
groups, John Holland and Consolidated
Home Industries, appear to be at the
bottom end of the swings which they
periodically make in the market. A. V.
Jennings and Leighton are rising from
their lower points of a few weeks ago
so it should not be long before Holland
and CHI follow suit.
CHI is probably the more attractive
of the two, because it is yielding 8|
percent as against Holland’s 5.7 percent.
At 65 cents, CHI shares are at their
lowest point for about six months and
well below the 80 cents odd that buyers
were paying at the beginning of this
year. Of course, there are sound reasons
for this. The company earned only
slightly higher profits in the December
six months and there does not seem
much hope of any improvement being
made on this trend in the current six
months. Nevertheless, pricing the shares
where they yield percent ignores the
fact that dividends seem very likely to
be held at 11 percent this year and
covered about three times by earnings.
The great attraction about CHI is
that the high dividend yield can be
considered safe. With such a wide cover
from earnings it would take a decent
sort of recession in the home building
industry to put the payout in any
danger. Moreover, it seems that direc-
tors are planning an increased payout
once profits start to pick up again. The
one percent lift in the final 1965-66
distribution was probably made with a
view to lifting the annual rate to 12
percent. The static performance in the
first half of the current year militated
against such a move and the interim
payout was held at five percent. The
shares are attractive in the short-term
because of the expected recovery in
market price and in the longer-term
because of the likelihood of a dividend
lift once earnings show a decent
increase.
Shares in the John Holland engineer-
ing and construction group are fetching
$l.lO. This is about 15 cents below the
level of a few weeks ago and the same
price as was ruling in the market a
year ago before the one-for-five bonus
issue news lifted the scrip to $1.40. The
5.7 percent yield comes from a 12?
percent dividend, which was covered
three times by 36.8 percent earnings
last year. There is no doubt that the
rate will be maintained on the increase
capital. John Holland’s appeal lies
mainly in the long-term.
The group will earn a record profit

• w ill show current assets twice the size
cu rrent liabilities, a complete
abs e nc e borrowed capital, and
reserves as large as paid capital. The
company has paid 10 percent dividends
ever y year since listing in the late 19505,
it has never revalued its assets, and it
has never made an issue to shareholders.
It s lowest earning rate was 12 percent
in 1958-59 and the highest 19.5 percent
in 1964-65.
In short, the company’s history is a
bore. But this is no reason for the shares
to be fetching such a low price. They
saw as much as 85 cents in 1964 when
earning rate was only 15.3 percent, and
their average price over the last couple
of years has been around 70 cents. It
seems that market gains must eventually
be made from a purchase at current
prices. In the meantime, the well-
covered dividend can provide one with
a handsome return on the investment.
AT 36 CENTS, VlA’s 50-cent shares
should be worth buying on the strength
of the recovery in business for this
maker of steel and timber products
(like partitions) for houses and offices
scored in the half year to March 31.
Profits were well above budget levels
and orders on hand for the current half
of the year were high. In 1965-66 the
company’s earning rate slumped from
22.8 to 4.7 percent. The final dividend
for the year had to be cut from to
l\ percent, making the full distribution
5 percent instead of the previous 10
percent. Interim dividend for the latest
half has been held at 2\ percent, and
it is anyone’s guess what the final will
be.
However, it seems certain that direc-
tors will restore the rate to 10 percent
as soon as possible. If this cannot be
done in the current year, then it is likely
that there will at least be a lift to, say,
7f percent. On the current 5 percent
rate the yield from a 36 cents buying
price is almost 7 percent. The shares
are worth par on the strength of the
recovery in profits alone; with an
increased dividend in prospect they
could even go higher. Taking even the
more pessimistic view, a lift in price
to par would provide handsome capital
profits. The shares have an asset back-
lng of 71 cents, which should support
a recovery in market prices to some
extent.

Security analyst on some miners
Sobering considerations from
Broken Hill South
MINING LIAS BEEN rediscovered in
the past year or two and, in particular,
a metal known as nickel (which was
used as a form of plating of other
metals before chromium) seems to have
acquired a value far greater than any
precious metal. In the Melbourne
Fifty Leaders Index there are six com-
panies which are closely associated with
mining, mainly the mining of silver,
lead, and zinc with some copper.
I shall consider these six stocks in this
series. They are: (a) Broken Hid
South Limited; (b) E. Z. Industries
Limited; (c) North Broken Hill
Limited; (d) Conzinc-Rio Tinto Aus-
tralia Limited; (e) New Broken Hill
Limited; and (f) Mount Isa Mines
Limited. The exercise will be to
attempt an appraisal of these companies
without the emotion that frequently
goes with the pricing of mining com-
panies. Whether this will prove to be
possible remains to be seen. The first
company will be Broken Hill South.
A feature of this company has been
the upward trend in the company’s
share price since mid-1962, when a low-
price of 74c was recorded. In the
subsequent period to the end of 1964,
the shares rose in a steep uptrend to
the $2.20-$2.40 level and since then
have continued to rise, albeit at a
slower rate, to current levels of around
$3.40 (with a high price of $3.85
recorded on May 23, 1967). Clearly,
the main impetus to the rising share
price in the steep uptrend referred to
was the increase in average metal prices
realised by “Souths” up to 1965 (as
shown in the following schedule). The
subsequent decline in lead and zinc
prices, with its consequent effects on the
profitability of the mining operations,
has not, however, been reflected in the
company’s share price movement.
Average prices realised ($)
, 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Lead (ton) 144.9 132 1 181.3 273.5 245.9
f ? c (to , n ) 180 3 173 7 229.6 283.4 269.5
i'lver (oz.) 0.85 1.06 1.14 1.16 1.15
In the current financial year, average
prices being realised for lead and zinc
are lower than in 1965/6, and this is a
factor contributing to the directors’ esti-
mate that 1966/7 profits will only be
: cer *ts_ per share, as against 13 cents
( m 1965/6. Souths’ dividend has also
been reduced correspondingly, from 12.5
cents a share in 1966 to 9 cents a
share for the current year. This means
mat at $3.40 the shares yield only 2.6
pet cent and are priced at over 37 times
estimated 1966/7 earnings!
. course, it is well recognised that
investors are pinning their hopes on
uture returns from Souths’ 76 2-3rd per-
cent interest in Cobar Mines Pty. Ltd.,
whlc h has cost it $11.7 million; its 16.6
Peicent interest in Alcoa of Australia
Pty. Ltd. (acquired at a cost of $8.3
million), and its recently discovered
“major” high-grade phosphate deposits
near Cloncurry, Queensland. Souths
have already stated that the location of
the phosphate deposits and the $l7 per
ton price of phosphate rock at Aus-
tralian ports indicates that “large out-
put will be needed for commercial
operation and commensurate capital
investment will be required.” The Minis-
ter for National Development, however,
has claimed that ore reserves have been
indicated exceeding 40,000 million tons,
and that it would probably cost about
$lOO million to develop the deposits.
Detailed feasibility tests on the deposits
are expected to take at least a year; in
the interim considerable speculation on
the outcome of these tests is bound to
continue.
To date, the Cobar operation seems
to have been somewhat of a disappoint-
ment. Profitability estimates made by
various “authorities” back in 1964/5
generally concluded that Souths’ share
of Cobar’s profits by 1966/7 would be
around $2 million (or 8 cents per
share), equivalent to the then profits
being derived from the lead/zinc mine.
These estimates were made on the basis
of copper prices somewhat below current
levels.
In the initial period of Cobar’s
operations (up to October 23, 1965),
recovery of copper by flotation aver-
aged 92 percent in a copper concen-
trate of average grade 24.3 percent.
These recoveries were said to be
“most satisfactory” at this early stage
of production. In the overall period to
June 25, 1966, though, the recovery of
copper averaged 90.5 percent in a
copper concentrate of average grade
22.5 percent. From subsequent produc-
tion reports it would appear that the
grade of concentrate has continued to
decline to around 20 percent. In addi-
tion, whereas it had been hoped that
the ore treatment rate would be around
700,000 tons a year by the end of the
current financial year, it now seems
that ore production for 1966-67 will be

around 420,000 tons. The company re-
ported in late April that ore produc-
tion will “soon ’ reach the target level,
and that achievement of this rate had
been delayed by “temporary difficul-
ties which are gradually being over-
come.” Nevertheless, whereas Cobar in-
cured a loss of $517,000 in 1965-66
(after a depreciation charge of
$476,000), directors have reported that
it will be profitable this year and pay
a dividend. This improvement in
profitability has been aided, though, by
the higher average copper price being
realised this year on domestic sales.
Current copper prices, however, could
well prove hard to substain in the
medium term, and each ton of Cobar’s
1967- copper output is most unlikely
to realise as much as in the present
financial year. It may well be, then,
that earlier profitability estimates for
Cobar will only be approached in the
early 19705.
Similar sobering considerations apply
to the awaited initial dividend from
Souths’ Alcoa investment. Early pro-
jections put down 1965-66 as the first
year in which dividends were likely
from Alcoa, but the latest one (includ-
ed in a recent comprehensive document
on Western Mining Corporation Ltd.)
indicates that the “most probable”
date of an initial dividend is during
1968- By 1971-72, however, the ex-
pected dividends of 10 percent per
annum from Alcoa will provide Souths
with an additional $830,000 in earn-
ings (or about 3 cents per share).
Souths’ latest “problem” relates to
its plant re-treating the large Mt. Heb-
bard residue dump. Because of the
limited ore reserves at its Broken Hill
mine, Souths have gradually reduced
production there in recent years in
order to prolong the mine’s life.

To offset this lower rate of ore pro-
duction at Broken Hill, Souths com-
menced treating, in September, 1966,
residues from the old Mt. Hebbard
dump. New plant has been installed with
a capacity of 270,000 tons of residues
p.a., though only 150,000 tons are ex-
pected to be treated to June 30, 1967
(as against the earlier estimated 200,000
tons), due to problems that have been
encountered in “grinding and metal-
lurgy.”
In view of the seeming unexciting
immediate outlook for any of Souths’
present mining activities, one must con-
clude that the major phosphate dis-
covery and the group’s active and suc-
cessful exploration program are being
accorded a very substantial valuation by
the sharemarket at the moment (at least
$1 per share), and that the medium-
term potentialities of the Cobar mine
and the Alcoa interest have already been
fully discounted.

Anything apparently connected with nickel seems to act
as a bait, so a host of at present distantly possible miners
were actively sought. Naturally the pioneer (and confirmed)
Western Mining dominated the bunch, adding $3.70 to hit
$19.00. Some base metals seemed less sure, yet CRA advanced
36 cents to $7.94 and New BH 90 cents to $7.00. Hamersl

C.T. Bowring & Co. Limited
Extracts from Mr. lan Skimming’s
Statement on the year’s results
RESULTS. "Your Company's profits for the year are
consistent with the forecast made in my interim
statement in November last in which I stated that
it was not anticipated that the results for 1966
would differ materially from those of 1965. The
balance of the considerable expense incurred in
moving to and re-equipping our new offices has
now been almost entirely absorbed.
C. T. BOWRING (INSURANCE) HOLDINGS
LTD. This company's results have been most
satisfactory and the overseas broking subsidiaries
are now beginning to make a significant con-
tribution to the Group's profit. The London based
broking companies again increased their revenue;
expenses increased, but nevertheless overall
profitability showed a satisfactory improvement’
UNDERWRITING. Marine experience continued
to be bad; hence revenue from this source
continued at the low level anticipated in last
year's statement. Non-Marine underwriting showed
some improvement.
SHIPPING. The Bowring Steamship Company's
results were as good as could be expected with a
reduced fleet and the effects of the Seamen's strike,
GENERAL TRADING. Last year's overall improve-
ment was not maintained, largely due to poor
results from our German Fishmeal subsidiary.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS.Thusfarthe current
year appears to be following a satisfactory course.
It remains our objective to do everything within our
power to promote the growth of your business."

Two uranium prospectors
DURING THE PAST two weeks there
have been quite divergent reports from
two uranium. companies “in waiting,”
United Uranium N.L. and Kathleen
Investments (Australia) Limited. While
United Uranium’s chairman, Mr. J. E.
Hiatt, had to report a disappointing
year’s result from the company’s lead-
zinc-silver mine at Moline in the Nor-
them Territory, as well as the lack of
any addition to the small uranium
reserves already held, the chairman of
Kathleen Investments, Mr. Roy Hudson,
was able to say that additional reserves
of uranium could be expected to be
established at Mary at een in t e
near future, and, in addition, was able
to report on a quite successful year’s
operations in which the company’s
profit rose from $272,000 to $611,000.
Another point of difference between
the two companies’ interests in uranium
is their approach to prospecting for this
mineral. United Uranium has already
brought in an overseas partner to assist
in the search (Western Nuclear has an
85 percent interest in two areas in
Arnhem Land and meets the cost of
exploration) and its chairman suggested
in his annual address that the company
was currently negotiating a further joint
exploration program. Kathleen Invest-
ments, on the other hand, appears
anxious to develop additional reserves,
as far as possible, with local resources.
Mr. Hudson said that the major ex-
ploration program planned by his com-
pany will be very expensive, and reten-
tion of the development of Anderson’s
Lode, together with that program, may
not be within the resources of the
company.
This statement raises some interest-
jn g possibilities. Which of these two
area s of Merest is Kathleen Invest-
ments likely t 0 retain and which is it
" c y , u leuun, anu wmcn is k
hkely to dispose of? To date the
company has been able, not without
s ° m ? difficulty, to build up an ex-
clusively Australian enterprise without
the assistance of finance from overseas.
Shareholders have been given the
opportunity, and have shown a marked
willingness, to provide the funds re-
quired for the company s develop-
ment.
In the past, however, Kathleen has
tended toward the acquisition of in-
terests in mineral deposits already
proved; it has been more of an in-
vestor and developer than a straight
exploration company. If this policy
were followed in the case of uranium,
a likely course for the company to
take could be the retention of Ander-
son’s Lode and the disposal of the
company’s other prospective uranium
deposits. The manner of such dis-
posal can only be a matter for con-
jecture, but no doubt it would involve
Kathleen Investments retaining a
sizable interest and selling the ven-
ture to another company. Again, on
past performances, it would not be
surprising if Kathleen shareholders
were offered the opportunity to pro-
vide at least part of the funds required
by such a company.
All this, of course, is still some time
in the future, and prospects for the
company at the present time appear
very bright, with considerable increases
in earnings indicated from several
sources. By the time money is needed
for uranium development the company
may be in a position to find the
finance from its own resources. Divi-

GRADUATES IN
MATHEMATICS,
STATISTICS AND
MATHEMATICAL
ECONOMICS
Opportunities exist for career ad-
vancement for graduates in mathe-
matics, statistics and mathematical
economics in developing and apply-
ing mathematical methods and
techniques in the work of Aus-
tralia’s national statistical service,
the Commonwealth Bureau of Cen-
sus and Statistics.
The wide responsibilities of the
Bureau in providing statistical ser-
vices to both Commonwealth and
State Governments, lead to a great
variety of developmental work.
There is thus every scope for the
advancement of specialist abilities
and the exercise of responsibility,
initiative and ingenuity in their
application.
A major area of interest to gradu-
ates in statistics and mathematics
is the design, analysis and technical
maintenance of sample surveys con-
ducted by the Bureau’s operational
divisions. A specialist sampling divi-
sion is responsible for this and other
sampling work, and applies exten-
sively such techniques as ratio esti-
mation, unequal probability sampl-
ing and multi-stage sampling. The
development and application of new
techniques is aided by access to the
Bureau’s large-scale computer ser-
vice.
Other areas of work include the
application of acceptance sampling
and quality control procedures to
large-scale clerical operations and
the use of experimental design in
the testing of survey procedures.
Work which could be of particular
interest to mathematical economists
includes the seasonal adjustment of
economic time series, the investiga-
tion of relationships between such
series, the application of spectral
analysis in these fields and the de-
velopment of marginal costing
methods to improve the efficiency
of sample designs.
Current research into mathematical
statistics includes studies of more
efficient methods of sampling with
unequal probabilities, optimisation
techniques and constrained sample
selections. Research is conducted
into both current theoretical de-
velopments and the application of
newly evolved techniques.
Training: The Bureau provides post
graduate training in certain areas
of special value in its work, includ-
ing sampling theory and practice, as
well as on-the-job training in a wide
variety of problems. Further study
and research in relevant fields is
encouraged.
Location: The Bureau’s specialist
mathematical and statistical divi-
sions are located at its Central Office
in Canberra.
Recruitment is at one of the levels
shown below depending on quali-
fications and experience. Further
advancement on ability is available
to these and higher levels. The
salary rates shown are actual rates
for males; rates for females are
slightly less. Married women can
apply.

castle) Limited are likely to continue
at the 1966 rate for the next two years
at least, accounting for over $4lO 000
per annum; Cable (1956) Limited
which lost $llO,OOO in 1965, brought
in a profit of $200,000 last year, and
this profit was earned in only six
months of the year. During the current
year, with ilmenite prices quite strong
Cable could earn perhaps $400,000, as
losses of previous years would consider-
ably reduce liability for taxation. Pil-
bara Tin Pty. Limited managed to
break even last year (a nominal loss
was incurred) in spite of considerable
difficulties, but should make a signifi-
cant contribution to this year’s group
earnings. Production in 1966 was 309
tons of tin concentrates of average
grade of 72 percent tin, containing
some 222 tons of tin metal, and pro-
duction this year is expected to be
materially higher. It would not be
unreasonable to look for a profit of
perhaps $200,000 from this subsidiary
this year.
Another source of increased revenue
is from Kathleen’s investment in North
West Iron Co. Limited. Last year
Kathleen Investments bought
SUS 1,200,000 of six percent preference
shares and 240,000 ordinary SUSI
shares in this company, which has a
50 percent interest in the development
of the Savage River (Tasmania) iron
ore pellet project to export 2,250,000
tons of pellets per annum for 20 years.
At the time these shares were pur-
chased there were accrued dividends
on the preference shares amounting to
$A56,675. When received, this accrued
dividend will have to be applied against
the cost of the shares, but dividends
accruing after the date of purchase in
November, 1966, will add a further
$65,000 to profits from 1968. Revenue
from mining royalties and rents re-
ceived by Australasian Oil Exploration
Limited should continue at much the
same rate as last year, and Kathleen
Investments’ profit for the year to
December, 1967, could approach sltn.

k een at high levels, with little inter-
ruption. Now that Zambia is returning
t 0 full output and is to treat the
stockpiles built up in the past year
pressures of oversupply will mount. And
because heavy buying by a dealer
associated with producer interests
steadied the fall earlier this year, the
LME market at present probably still
does not reflect the current basic Situa-
tion. T .
At the recent Lusaka meeting of
producers, forecasts of output and use
indicated a surplus of 820,000 tons a
year in 1972 —6,730,000 production and
5 900,000 consumption. By 1977 cap-
acity was expected to be 7,370,000 tons
a year and consumption 7,330,000 tons.
ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY the world
producers’ price for zinc is still £stg.lo2
a ton, sales are actually being made
below this level by means of reductions
in the premiums normally paid for
various grades. The cuts appear to be
about £3-4 a ton on premiums of
between £4 to £9. And on the LME,
prices are holding below £lO2 even with
producer-buying support.
It is probably too early yet to forecast
a cut in the producer price, however,
despite the likely increase in pressures
from surplus capacity later this year.
The leading smelters and miners have
indicated that they believe the current
level to be a fair price and will pre-
sumably do their best to make a success
of their 10 percent production-cut
program.
“WIDE FLUCTUATIONS” will be
the rule in the silver market for coming
months as speculators jockey for
position. This is the view of Samuel
Montagu and Co., and has so far been
borne out by events following the U.S.
export “ban” on silver from the
Treasury.
From lll|d stg. early in May, the
price shot up to 150 d early this month
before losing some ground. Overall
there seems little basic reason for prices
to hold at these levels.

THE LAND
A mixed bag: of olives,
lamb, and eggs
AMERICANS HAVE long appreciated
the decorative beauty of the olive tree
and recognised its advantages for street
and patio plantings. Its roots do not
break up footpaths or disrupt under-
ground service lines. Its branches do
not tend to foul overhead wires or
drop any litter except fruits. These,
unfortunately, fall over a long period
and cause considerable nuisance by dis-
coloring pavements, sticking to pedes-
trians’ shoes, and attracting birds with
their messy droppings.
So, American plant explorers have
gone out from time to time to the
original home of the olive (Olea
europaea). They have scoured the
Middle East and the Mediterranean
Mutton taste not for the U.S.
regions for a fruitless tree. But they had
no luck, which, perhaps, is not sur-
prising, as the olive has been the symbol
of fertility throughout the long history
of the Mediterranean peoples. Then,
several years ago, we invited H. T.
Hartmann, the Professor of Pomology
the University of California, to visit
here. While doing the rounds of the
State Departments of Agriculture he
was careful to ask whether anyone had
seen a fruitless olive. Eureka! A Vic-
torian horticulturist was able to direct
him to a lone specimen of sterility
growing near Swan Hill.
To the owner’s certain memory this
Particular tree had not borne a single
mit in 30 years, although it was always
healthy and vigorous and surrounded by
other olive trees which fruited regularly
a, rd heavily. The tree was blooming
"hen Hartmann arrived and so he was
a e to see that all the flowers were
lm Perfect, being male only. So great
was his excitement and joy that, without
stopping for permission, he immediately
took cuttings and airmailed them home
to Davis, Calif. There they were grafted
to local olives and every trick known
to horticulturists to force a tree to fruit
was applied. Hartmann’s luck held: no
one fruit has appeared during three
possible seasons.
More recently, another American, Dr.
D. Cramer, of Colorado State Univer-
sity, took himself off to the antipodes
to study the flavor of New Zealand
lamb. There he appears to have made
a discovery which the “Kiwis” and
perhaps ourselves, some day, will bless
him for.
Mutton flavor is detested by the
average American, and this distaste,
more than anything else, probably has
prevented Australasia from establishing
a large market for lamb in the U.S.A.
In the States, some lambs never set foot
on pasture and most are finished on
grain feeding. Such lamb has a very
bland flavor, usually.
Cramer trained and set up taste-
testing panels in New Zealand. Their
job was to assess the intensity of mutton
flavor and odor in chops. These were
obtained from lambs raised on different
types of pasture. Before being presented
to the tasters the chops were cooked
under identical conditions. White-clover-
dominated pastures produced strong
mutton flavor compared to ryegrass
pastures. He got the same result with
lucerne.
The tests covered various breeds and
crosses of lambs raised under the widely
different climatic conditions of the North
and South Islands. Analysis of the vola-
tile fatty acids produced in the rumen
paralleled the findings of the tasters.
Cramer the chemist, just as Cramer the
gourmet, could detect which lambs
came from which pastures. He has now
gone home to study further the theory
that all legumes contain a substance
which intensifies mutton flavor.
As if timed to calm the raging con-
troversy over egg marketing, the Vic-
torian Department of Agriculture has
just published the production figures of
its commercial layer flock. The moral
of its figures seems to be that if pro-
ducers set aside their present squabbles
and concentrated on the job of manag-
ing their hens better, they could prob-
ably make more economic progress than
by any manipulation of the market.

has a greater influence on cost of pro-
duction than possibly any other single
factor. The Department’s flock averages
245-250 eggs per bird per year. The
comparable figure for the average farm
flock is 185-190. And the Department
people point out that their flock con-
sists of unculled commercial stock. If
they practised culling, as farmers do, the
figure would be as high as 260.
They say that their high eggs-per-bird
figure is accounted for by two mana-
gerial practices. By bringing pullets into
the laying pens on an all-in-all-out
system, the flock has remained virtually
disease-free. Secondly, the pullets are
put in their laying pens at six weeks
of age.

A wonder elixir,
thiabendazole
MEMORIES OF last century’s elixir
pills come flooding back at the sound of
the name “thiabendazole.” But while
science never managed to verify the bold
daims of the old medical quacks, it
assures us that thiabendazole will not
only kill a wide range of gastro-
intestinal worms, both in their mature
and immature forms together with their
eggs, in sheep and cattle, but that it is
also a cure for facial eczema and, of
all things, crown rot of bananas.
This last disease, formerly known
as “black-end,” is caused by the fungus
Colletotrichum musae and is very
prevalent. Losses of bananas due to it
are of serious proportions. Though
many fungicides and other chemicals
have been tried over a number of
years in efforts to arrest this rot, none
has shown much promise. Now, taking a
lead from medical science, which had
recently discovered that thiabendazole
has fungicidal properties, the Plant
Pathology Section of the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries has
dipped bunches of bananas in weak
solutions of this remarkable drug.
Lo and behold the treatment
proved to be extraordinarily effective.
The Department is continuing its ex-
periments to work out an ideal prac-
tical procedure for banana growers and
to find which concentration of thia-
bendazole is best.
Meanwhile our alert transtasman
neighbors had been reading the same
Medical report, which had stated that
thiabendazole appears to be highly
effective against saprophytic organisms
deluding cultures which produce myco-
toxins.” (The scientific literature, as it
is called, makes heady reading for the
initiated.) To the people at the Manu-

tuke Research Station, Ruakura, these
words evoked the idea that maybe this
drug could be used to control facial
eczema in sheep as a (saprophytic)
fungus is involved.
Merck Sharp and Dohme, the sole
proprietors of thiabendazole, were of
course only too pleased to supply a
specially prepared suspension suitable
for experimental spraying of pastures
infected with the facial eczema fungus
Pithomyces chartarum. Again, mar-
vellous to relate, the spraying
thoroughly suppressed the normal seas-
onal build-up of the fungus in the
pastures.
However, the New Zealanders will
need to exercise all their ingenuity, to-
gether with helpful consideration from
Merck Sharp and Dohme, if their dis-
covery is ever to mean anything to
Drenching sheep with “Thibenzole”
sheep farmers. The cost of the material
alone for the spraying trials came to
sixteen fat New Zealand pounds per
acre. That’s about $4O an acre in our
language.
The Victorian Department of Agri-
culture is our best authority on facial
eczema. After heavy losses amounting
to an estimated 10,000 head were in-
curred in Gippsland in 1959, the
Department bought a 150-acre property
in the area and set it up as a field
station for the sole purpose of studying
this disease. The field work has been
amply supported by laboratory studies
on both the plant and veterinary sides.
The fungus only flourishes when
special climatic conditions occur. Three
or more consecutive nights when the
grass temperature does not fall below
60deg. F. and the relative humidity
remains above 80 percent are needed
to stimulate the fungus. A second
similar period occuring a few weeks
later produces a massive build-up of
spores sufficient to poison the pasture.
The animals die from liver damage
over the next two to eight weeks.

Artist’s country life
One of a series on "Living is an Art" by SHEELAH WOOD
Mrs. Raymond Bury is interviewed by Sheelah Wood in a corner of the veranda of
her house on the Mornington Peninsula, outside Melbourne
Mrs. Raymond Bury, who is also
Anne Church, the stage designer, lives
in an Arcadian setting on the Morning-
ton Peninsula outside Melbourne.
Her grandmother was a Russian
Princess, whose three daughters and
seven sons were at one time spectacular
identities of London. One daughter,
Madam Rachel Ospovat, designed
clothes for the Queen Mother, then the
pretty Duchess of York, Gladys Cooper,
the famous Lady Diana Cooper, and
many other great beauties of the era.
A brother was Henri Ospovat, a well-
known caricaturist and illustrator.
Anne’s father was stationed in London
during World War I. He first saw her
mother walking down a staircase in a
rose-pink chiffon dress designed by her
sister. It was love at first sight, but
it was not till the end of the war that
they were married and came to Aus-
tralia, where Anne was born.
It is not surprising that, with this
background, Mrs. Bury chose an artistic
career. She was educated at school in
England and Australia. She matriculated
at 15 and flew as fast as she could to
the Melbourne Technical School and
then to the Gallery. She furthered her
studies in Europe and lived there for
many years.
To date, she considers her most
thrilling achievement was being asked,
at the age of 22 years, to design the
first full-length production in Australia
of “Swan Lake.” She also designed the
production of the “Melbourne Cup
Ballet,” which the Australian Ballet
Company performed with great success
at Covent Garden in 1962.
Her South Yarra house is as original
as her farmhouse, with open - brick
kitchen cupboards and ceramic floors
opening into a living- dining-room,
where the guests can enjoy her cooking
while drinking their aperitifs. These,
incidentally, are champagne only for
large parties, with black or red caviar
on pumpernickel. If it is a smaller
gathering, the guests often start with
the wine they are going to drink with
the meal. There is also a tray for the
spirit drinkers.
Mrs. Bury prefers to do most of her
entertaining in the country, and she
likes it to be casual and informal. Mrs.
Bury believes that the weather is more
important than the variety of the guests.
“Give them the right weather, good
food and drink, and the rest follows,”
she says.
She runs her beautifully simple
country house with daily help, but does
all the cooking herself. The green-
grocer calls at the farm. She has never
learnt to drive a car (lucky her!). The
other goods she orders by telephone,
and buys cheeses and unusual vege-
tables, etc., on her trips to town. The


The hand-painted chest in one of the bedrooms is Italian. Above it is a picture by
David Strachan of “Tobias and the Angel”
Left: The Italian tiles bordering the fireplace and covering a wall of the sitting-room
are red and white. The sketch on the far wall is of mime Marcel Marceau and is by
Theyre Lee-Elliott
Below left: The scrubbed table in Mrs. Bury’s kitchen is good old Australian country
style. The crucifix above the stove is Bavarian. The stove is in use in wintertime
garden and farm are her husband’s
domain. Everywhere you turn there is
something to enchant the eye and
lead you on to another vista of
unstudied landscaping and intimate
garden settings.
At the back of the house there are
groves of poplars planted to charm,
but also to drain the moisture seeping
from an old dam planted around with
willows. This idea the Burys got in
Spain, where they noticed the silver
rippling trees planted for miles along
the riverbanks. They discovered that
the thrifty Spanish people do this to
drain the muddy riverbanks and grow
more pasture for their flocks of goats
and sheep.
The menus in this article are the ones
Mrs. Bury served to actor John Gielgud
when he was their guest during his visit
to Australia. I hope you will enjoy
them as much as he did.
WINES
Chosen by Mrs. Bury.
LUNCHEON The lighter the
wine served with the artichokes, the
more delicious they will taste. I suggest
a dry white table wine Seabrooks
Rhine Riesling (mixed with soda
can be excellent). The pot au feu is
a real country dish, and a good claret
such as Coonawarra Cabernet, or, in
very cold weather, Hardy’s St. Thomas
Burgundy is suitable.

GLOBE ARTICHOKES
Ingredients: 1 large or 2 small arti-
chokes per person, oil, salt and pepper,
vinaigrette sauce.
Method: Choose very fresh arti-
chokes —not those with spiny leaves —
and sprinkle them with salt. Place them
in pot, the bottom of which is covered
with olive oil. Boil up a kettle of water


Table for an al fresco luncheon is set with Italian pottery, French wood, and
Portuguese glassware. The setting alone is enough to make you enjoy your meal
and pour the boiling water over the
artichokes. Put the pot immediately on
the fire so the oil and water mix at
once, and boil for about 20 minutes
(uncovered) or longer if the artichokes
are large. Drain well. Serve warm with
melted butter or cold with french
dressing or a vinaigrette sauce.
POT AU FEU AVEC LES LEGUMES
Ingredients: A piece of good boiling
beef, lean, with a strip of fat on one
side only, carrots, onions, leeks, rock-
salt, if possible, bouquet garni, cloves,
black peppercorns.
Method: Put the beef in a large
heavyweight pot, cover it with cold
water and add a tablespoon of salt, a
few peppercorns, one sliced onion, one
sliced carrot, one small onion stuck with
four cloves, and the bouquet garni
(branch of celery leaves, branch of
parsley and bay leaf tied together).
Bring to the boil and skim off any scum.
Simmer for about four hours. Then
add to the pot, and cook small whole
carrots, the white part of the leeks
(make sure these are soaked in cold
water for some hours to remove any
sand or soil), and, for each person, a
small onion stuck with cloves.
Remove the beef, carve it in slices,
and put it on the serving dish, sur-
rounded with the vegetables. Strain
the bouillon and serve it separately.
The meat is best eaten warm, but the
bouillon must be very hot. The latter
may either be served first or at the
same time as the meat, and a spoon-
ful of bouillon is poured over each help-
ing, as with gravy.
Make a stiff mayonnaise with plenty
of mustard and serve this separately;
also provide two different types of
mustard French and German, or
two different kinds of French mustard
• black ground pepper and ground
rocksalt.
ROMAINE EN SALADE
Ingredients: Lettuce, 2 eggs, parsley,
french dressing.
Method: Romaine is the cos or
Italian lettuce, with long leaves. Choose
small lettuce if possible, discard the
outside leaves if very coarse. Wash and
drain the salad well and do not break
up the leaves. Boil one or two eggs
(depending on the amount of salad)
until the whites of the eggs are set
but the yolks are still liquid. Separate
the whites of eggs from the yolks and
toss the salad in the yolks until each
leaf is covered.
Make a french dressing to which is
added the chopped white of egg and
a large tablespoon of chopped parsley.
Toss the salad again in the dressing
and sprinkle with black ground pepper.
The salad is eaten in the fingers.
SUNDAY SUPPER
COLD CUCUMBER SOUP
Ingredients: 1 medium cucumber per
person, 1 dessertspoon butter per
cucumber, 1 tablespoon flour per
cucumber, 1 cup chicken stock per
cucumber, 1 large cup of milk scalded
with one onion, cream, white pepper,
chopped chives.
Method: Peel the cucumbers, remove
the seeds, and cut the cucumbers in
pieces. Cook them very slowly in the
butter until they are transparent, stir-
ring constantly, as they must on no
account burn.
Sprinkle them with flour, spoonful
by spoonful, and stir it in. Add the
stock gradually, stirring all the time.
Strain the milk and add it to the
soup; simmer for ten minutes. Pass the
soup through a sieve and again through
a very fine sieve. Add white pepper
salt, and stir in a generous cup 0 f
either fresh or sour cream. Chill
thoroughly and serve sprinkled with
chopped chives (or parsley).
MELON AND PROSCIUTTO
Prosciutto (Italian smoked ham) is
now available from most good delica-
tessen shops. It must be sliced paper-
thin and is delicious combined with
canteloupe melons, chilled, and cut in
thin sections. Serve a bowl of black or
green olives separately.
INDIVIDUAL OMELETS
The cold cucumber soup is best fol-
lowed by a light hot dish. In the
country, if we dine in the kitchen, it
is easy enough to make each person a
two-egg omelet —the eggs beaten up
with salt, black pepper, and a spoon-
ful of chopped parsley. However, if we
dine outside, and, since I do not possess
a chafing-dish, the Prawns Gratine is
less tiresome to serve and may easily be
prepared in advance.
PRAWNS GRATINE
Ingredients: 4 to 6 prawns per person,
depending on the size of the prawns,
bowl of bechamel sauce, white wine
or lemon juice, parmesan cheese,
powdered mustard, chilli sauce.
Method: Make a fairly stiff bechamel
sauce with salt, white pepper, and
powdered mustard to taste. Break it
down with a glass of white wine (or
lemon juice) and enough chilli sauce to
taste but not to destroy the flavor of
the prawns. For a rather more full-
bodied flavor, port or a medium-dry
sherry may be used instead of the
wane.
Add the prawns, cut in pieces, to the
sauce, and pour into a buttered earthen-
ware oven dish. Cook in a hot oven
until the top of the dish is a golden
brown. This may be made alternately
using crayfish, or for a grander occasion
as an entree made with mixed seafood
including shrimps and oysters.
COMPOTE D’ETE
Ingredients: Apricots, peaches, cherries,
strawberries, damson plums.
Method: The fruit should be small
and not overripe. Poach each fruit
separately (except the strawberries) in
a very little water or white wine in a
deep frying pan until just soft. They
should be brought to the boil very
quickly and cooked uncovered. Drain
the fruit well and reserve the liquid.
Wash and drain the strawberries and
sprinkle them with sugar—-keep them
in a separate dish and chill them. When
the other fruits are thoroughly drained,
put them together in the dish in whic
they are to be served, sprinkle them
with a quantity of sugar and chi
thoroughly. Before serving, add the
strawberries but do not mix them wit'
the rest of the fruit. The mixed f rul
liquid may be chilled and
separately as a sauce. I do not cm
for cream with this dish, but pl ain
yoghurt is excellent.

Graham Greene’s black comedy
By LEONIE KRAMER
]^ a y We Borrow Your Husband?
Graham Greene. Bodley Head. $2.85.
GRAHAM GREENE’S literary career
j s a warning against premature judg-
ments and rash predictions. To look
back to early novels such as “England
Made Me” and “Brighton Rock” is to
realise that one could not have argued
from them to his latest novel, “The
Comedians,” or to this collection of
short stories. He is still a master of
suspense and controlled excitement. He
can compel one to feel the presence of
evil, even when it comes veiled in
comedy; chere is in these stories a wis-
dom which does not soften the sharp
edge of his satire or blunt his keen
observation, but which broadens their
perspective.
“May We Borrow Your Husband?” is
sub-titled “and other comedies of the
sexual life” misleading only if one
expects the laborious and detailed
realism currently fashionable. The
stories achieve their effects largely by
understatement. The success of several
of them depends on sheer fantasy.
“The Over-night Bag” is about a non-
descript little man who travels by plane
from Nice back to London carefully
guarding a bag which contains a dead
baby. One never learns how it came
to be there, or why he is so anxious
not to have it shaken about, or why
be is taking it home to Mother, or
what he is going to do with it when
he gets there. A woman who sits next
to him in the plane is interested only-
in how he is to get it past the Customs
officials, a London taxi driver assures
him that babies keep longer than old
people.
“Awful When You Think of It”
records a conversation between the
elderly narrator and a baby in a
wicker basket a conversation which
takes place in a railway carriage be-
tween Reading and Slough. “A Shock-
lng Accident” is about a young man
whose father is killed when a pig falls
°n him from a balcony in Naples.
Rories such as these have nothing to do
w*th realism, yet each of them, even
The Over-night Bag,” leaves one with
,/ strong sense of actuality. In them
Greene creates a world where the im-
probable is possible, funny, and reveal-
wg. His fantasy world makes sense of
the real world.
All the stories in “May We Borrow
rour Husband?” are comedies in the
°bvious sense of the term. It is funny
to read about Beauty, a pampered
Pekingese, escaping from his mistress to
scavenge in the dustbins in a back
street in Antibes. It is funny to observe
Jerome in “A Shocking Accident” try-
ing to devise a way of telling the story
of his father’s death without making
his listeners laugh. And it is funny to
read about a' newly married man who
keeps discovering carefully planted
letters from his recently rejected mis-
tress. Life, Greene seems to be saying,
is absurd, and in saying this he means
more than that it is merely laughable.
He does not choose, in these stories,
to see life as tragic, though some of
the situations he presents are poten-
tially so. His characters are the victims
of circumstance, but they neither
triumph over nor declaim against their
absurd fate. Rather they accept it with
a curious kind of placid awareness. In
pure comedy, circumstances are no
more than a temporary obstacle to
human happiness. Here, human hap-
piness is hardly an issue. Greene’s
human beings settle for something less
an acceptance of fortuitous limita-
tions.
This point is most clearly made in
the stories which do not derive their
surface comedy from Greene’s special
brand of grotesque fantasy. The
longest and most complex are the title
story and “Cheap in August.” The first
concerns the seduction of a young man
on his honeymoon by two practised
homosexuals. The second presents a
holiday meeting between the English
wife of a precise young American pro-,
fessor and an elderly, poor, unsuc-
cessful American. In both, Greene
creates a twilight world of the emotions.
To neither story are the words hap-
piness or frustration appropriate. Both
are concerned with a world where life
cannot be lived at full pressure, and
where, though the reality falls short of
expectations, it is accepted.
In both stories, as in others in the
collection, the emotional world of the
characters has its exact counterpart in
the real world they temporarily
inhabit. The honeymooners arrive in
Antibes after the season is over. They
come to a cold, deserted town given
back to the local inhabitants, its
tourist-made, artificial vitality gone
with the sun. The professor’s wife and
her elderly companion are taking
advantage of the off-season in the
Caribbean, and perhaps all they have
in common after all is the fact that
“for both of them Jamaica was cheap
in August.” Life has played them the
Graham Greene
comic trick of abandoning them to
minor satisfactions.
Most of the stories imply, and some
refer directly to, moral questions. In
“May We Borrow Your Husband?” the
two young homosexuals are pointedly
criticised by the middle-aged narrator.
That he confesses to his own matri-
monial failures does not deprive his
criticism of its validity. Greene secures
our sympathy for the narrator even
while demonstrating his limitations, and
so makes certain that we shall accept
his view of the ruthless and expert
plotting of the two young men. A par-
allel situation, this time with les-
bianism as its motif, is presented in
“Chagrin in Three Parts.” Its criti-
cism is less explicit, but as effective.
In “The Root of All Evil” a comic
cautionary tale illustrates the text
“Original sin gave man a tilt toward
secrecy.” Greene’s narrator preserves
an attitude of detached amusement to
the tale he tells, but it makes its point
nevertheless. At no time, however chill-
ing the observations of human relation-
ships, does one lose the sense of the
author’s wise sympathy for the victims
of the human comedy. They may be
fools or villains, but they invite criti-
cism or pity, not contempt.
The comic spirit alone could hardly
have made these stories more than
slight reflections upon the absurdity
of life. A world in which the right
people encounter each other too late or
not at all, in which expectations are
absurdly disappointed, in which
innocence is betrayed into secrecy and
violence, in which love is haunted by
jealousy, should bring despair rather
than enjoyment. Greene’s benevolent
charity and unsentimental compassion
lend even to the oddest and most absurd
situations a compelling faith in human
sanity.


The wrong Nehru
By KHRISHWANT SINGH
Panditji. A portrait of Jawaha-rlal
Nehru. Marie Seton. Dobson. $9.80.
NEHRU COULD BE likened to the
Hindu trinity consisting of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva—the Creator, Pre-
server, and Destroyer. He, as the
successor to Mahatma Gandhi, was
the chief architect and creator of an
independent India. As Prime Minister
for 17 years he kept the country to-
gether; he gave India a stable, demo-
cratic form of Government and through
the Five Year plans put it on the road
to prosperity. Nehru —particularly the
aging Nehru also sowed the seeds
of India’s destruction. By giving in to
regional separatism, he started the pro-
cess of disintegration.
He believed that the population ex-
plosion was a capitalist myth and re-
fused to take it seriously until it was
tragically demonstrated that the birth-
rate nullified every advance in indus-
try and agriculture. He surrounded
himself with a bunch of charlatans
until administration became a mockery:
commissions of inquiry pronounced
many of his trusted advisers corrupt
or inefficient. His foreign policies
brought on India a humiliating defeat
at the hands of the Chinese, two
wars with Pakistan, and roused the
animosity of other neighbor nations:
Nepal, Burma, and Ceylon. It is a
miracle that despite Nehru India sur-
vives as a free nation.
Nehru was many men in one: a
dreamer of socialist Utopias, a student
of history, a writer of sensitive prose,
and an aesthete. He was also a rabble-
rouser, vain, egocentric, intolerant of
criticism, and susceptible to flattery.
What more could a biographer ask
for in terms of material?
The chief difficulty of Nehru’s bio-
graphers has been that he wrote an
eminently readable autobiography be-
fore he achieved greatness and his
idealism was sullied by power. The
autobiography, along with published
correspondence with members of his
family, notably his daughter, the pre-
sent Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira
Gandhi, remains the most authentic
source of information on him. It was
this Nehru who fired a whole genera-
tion of youth with visions of a world
at peace, a prosperous world in which
there was equality and justice. This
Nehru was India’s Abraham Lincoln
and John F. Kennedy in one.
Nehru was not able to pronounce
on himself as a Prime Minister and an
international statesman, so for a total
picture we have to rely on his
biographers. There have been a large
number and the corpus of Nehruana
continues to grow. Most Indians tend
to be wholly eulogistic: hero worship
comes natural to us and there was
plenty about Nehru to justify his
deification. The most balanced of the
Pandit Nehru and Krishna Menon
hero-worshippers (to whom Nehru en-
trusted some of his father’s correspon-
dence) is B. R. Nanda, whose book
“The Nehrus” gives a pleasant though
uncritical background of the family.
There is also a biography by Frank
Moraes, editor successively of India’s
two leading national newspapers a
voluminous rambling work of a man
who had many other things on his
mind. D. F. Karaka’s “The Lotus
Eater of Kashmir” is a diatribe by a
man at his best when he dips his pen in
vitriol. Foreigners have been more
objective in their assessment of Nehru.
The Canadian Michael Brecher’s
“Nehru: A Political Biography” is the
most reliable account of Nehru as an
administrator. For portrayal of Nehru,
both as a man and as Prime Minis-
ter, by far the best work to date is
“Nehru: A Contemporary,” by Walter
Crocker, who was twice High Com-
missioner for Australia in New Delhi.
And now we have Marie Seton. She
wandered into the Nehru household in
1955 and has continued to wander in
and out of it ever since -- cherished
by everyone in the Big House. Nehru
sought her company when he was
lonely and felt he had lost touch;
Indira Gandhi sought solace from her
when stricken with grief; the staff of
private secretaries and servants sought
her when some crisis threatened.
“Marieji” was always there to hold
everyone’s hand in turn. She is a film
producer by profession. Her portrayal
of Panditji is proof of her considerable
powers of imagination.
An essential prerequisite of a good
biography is that the biographer must
keep himself out of the picture as
much as possible. Marie Seton puts
herself first. She also expends an un-
necessary amount of space talking of
people who have nothing whatsoever to
do with Nehru. And of those who came
into Nehru’s life, she is loud in praise
for Nehru’s favorites and decries his
critics. At times the tone of sycophancy
is nauseating.
There are many errors of fact. Mr.
Jinnah did not break with the Congress
on the issue of wearing home-m h
handspun cloth but on separate ren
sentation for Muslims; General D C '
did not fire on passive resisters
Amritsar but on a crowd of people w],
had assembled at Jallianwala after the
Baisakhi fair; the agreement between
Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin was
not and is not known as the Delhi but
the Gandhi-Irwin Pact; at no tim*
did Chou En-lai tell Nehru that he
accepted the McMahon Line of border
demarcation; Mahatma Gandhi had
nothing to do with the offer of pl e bi s .
cite to the peoples of Kashmir; Shaikh
Abdullah of Kashmir was in fact put
on trial (the charges were subsequently
dropped); the cartoon on page 306 does
not depict Pratap Singh Kairon as stated
in the caption but Swaran Singh; Jaya.
prakash Narayan was never a “person-
ally oriented opponent” of Nehru. He
was much respected by Nehru and is
today considered the keeper of India's
conscience.
Marie Seton’s pronouncements on
India’s foreign affairs read like ill-
digested handouts of the Ministry of
External Affairs. She goes out of her
way to champion Mr. Krishna Menon
and jibe at his critics. To prove Mr,
Menon’s popularity she cites his elec-
tion victory over J. B. Kripalani in
Bombay. She overlooks the fact that
Menon more than anyone else was the
cause of the Indian army’s debacle in
1962 (“The Untold Story,” by General
B. M. Kaul, the corps commander,
amply substantiates this); that charges
of mishandling of funds worth millions
of pounds laid before the Parliament
by the Public Accounts Committee still
remain unanswered; and that many
Indians feel that Menon did more
damage to the image of India abroad
than its worst enemies could have done,
As soon as Nehru’s influence was re-
moved, the same Mr. Menon despite
massive support from Leftist elements
was twice beaten by nondescript oppon-
ents.
Marie Seton’s portrait of Nehru has
two dubious distinctions; it is the
longest and the dullest.
Bright brotherhood
By ELWYN LYNN
Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite Brother-
hood. G. 11. Fleming. Hart-Dam
$7.00.
IN SEPTEMBER, 1848, seven art
students, the oldest 23, formed a secret
brotherhood to rout the establishing
that supported the art then shown
the Royal Academy, where the wor s
were described, in 1848, by Holrnaji
Hunt, one of the Brotherhood, as 0
lows: “the pious had vitreous tears o
their reverential cheeks; innkeepc
were round find red-faced; peasants a
complexions of dainty pink; s
herdesses were facsimiled from Dres e


rhina toys; homely couples were ever
jding the Family Bible to a circle of
ie cf exemplary children; all alike from
f „ tn nlebeian were arrayed in clothes
fres h from a band box.
g u t was the Brotherhood intent upon
na turalism like Courbet’s that, a
; ew years later, aroused the wrath of
( ), e French Salon inmates? Not at all.
ghey wished to dethrone Raphael and
llir n, not to an archaic art, as their
detractors alleged, but as Ruskin, their
defender and saviour, declared in one of
Ids famous letters to “The Times,” to
“archaic honesty.” The honest truth is
lljjl they did treat early Christian sub-
lets rather stiffly and hardly avoided
uhat we still dislike in Victorian paint-
ing—its soppy sentiment. They knew
little of Pre-Raphaelite art a fact
not stressed by G. H. Fleming. Only
three of the seven Hunt, Gabriel Ros-
setti, and John Millais were to be-
come famous; Frederick Stephens, Wil-
liam Rossetti, James Collinson and
Thomas Woolner (who did some
notable sculpture) achieving little.
The group is a curiosity: one of those
like the German Nazarenes that tried
to dispute the notion that the Renais-
sance, was a story of progress from
Giotto to Leonardo; it was curious, too,
in that it did not include Ford Madox
Brown, who had visited the Nazarenes,
had taught Rossetti, and had painted,
between 1845 and 1851, a true Pre-
Raphaelite painting, the N.S.W. Art
Gallery’s “Chaucer at the Court of
Edward III.” Indeed the movement,
il it can be called that, was concerned
mainly with techniques and a confronta-
tion of the Academy. These defiant
rebels were pledged to secrecy, the
letters PRB, however, being permitted
to appear after their names. (This
was translated as “Please Ring Bell,”
and in the case of Deverell, a later
recruit, “Penis Rather Better.”)
Fleming, though he details their early
activities accurately and entertainingly,
does not give sufficient account of what
they were rebelling against. If he had,
he might have revealed all too well
what the assault on the citadel meant;
for, after an abusive battle in 1850,
the Pre-Raphaelites were accepted by
1852, and eventually Millais became
President of the Royal Academy.
IVoolner, who had gone to the Vic-
torian goldfields to dig into something
more rewarding than marble, wrote
home prophetically in 1854, “Millais
seems to be looked on as onq of the
great London lions. I should wonder
hut little if the Queen knighted him
soon.” Millais became an Associate
that year and Hunt went off to paint
a sc apegoat in Palestine. Christina Ros-
)etti made the poetic but not penetrat-
es remark that the “whole Round
able is dissolved”; but the Brother-
,°°u wa s not so chivalrous. Rossetti
showed his first PR (translate, “Public
cations”) work at the Free Exhibition
c ore the RA show, was praised in the
scnce of competition, and left the
Ppalled Millais and Hunt to brave it
alc f at the RA.
ctually, the paintings by Millais
and Hunt were praised and it was not
until the aims of the Brotherhood
became public that the storm broke;
then, critical savagery was unleashed,
because, as one critic indicated, the
sin was to discount Titian, Guido, and
Raphael as “small-beer daubers”; Mil-
lais was accused of “pictorial blas-
phemy,” and Dickens in his “Household
Words” described Millais’ “The Car-
penter Shop” (about Christ’s boyhood)
with inaccurate abuse and schoolboy
facetiousness - the mother of Jesus
“would stand out from the rest of the
company as a monster in the vilest
cabaret in France or the lowest gin-
show in England.” Dickens concluded
by saying that if the Royal Academy
persisted in its hospitality to the Pre-
Raphaelites it “might place her
Gracious Majesty in a very painful
position one of these fine Private View
days.”
Fleming deals with these zany events
with lively amusement, but barely in-
dicates that there was a general dis-
content with English art and its
critical defenders. Prince Albert at the
Royal Academy castigated “the pro-
fessional writers who often strive to
impress the public with a great idea
of their own artistic knowledge by the
merciless manner in which they treat
works which cost those who produce
them the highest efforts of mind and
feeling” and Ruskin demonstrated the
inaccuracies of the criticism levelled
against the Brotherhood’s paintings.
Nonetheless the Brotherhood had no
great effect; Rossetti’s main influence
was on Burne-Jones, and though the
style has its champions, from Hunting-
ton Hartford’s “Modern Museum” (he
also shows battle scenes by Dali) in
New York to those who thought it wise
to circulate a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition
in Australia several years ago, the move-
ment is best described by forgive me
a dealer, Rene Gimpel, who said in
1923, “It’s a child of old parents, and
it bears the mark of ennui on its face
of deep and frightful ennui!”
Was this true of Rossetti’s poetry?
Fleming discusses the PRB journal,
“The Germ,” and perhaps he will say
more about the poetry in his proposed
second volume.
Mixed motives
By NANCY KEESING
Time Expired. G. C. O’Donnell. Lek-
sand. $3.85.
THIS IS A NOVEL about New
Guinea written by a man who, since
1937, has had a long and distinguished
career in that country as patrol officer,
administrator, and soldier. I found it
hard to “get into” his book and, for a
time, thought it a pity he had chosen
the novel rather than some factual form.
As I read on I realised my mistake
only fiction is flexible enough to make
the impact and deliver the message of
this book. Some of its apparent faults
finally emerge as virtues.
The time of the action covers a short
period soon after World War II when
Government officers and private owners
are trying to reconstruct and reorganise
villages, plantations, and societies dis-
rupted by fighting, death, and Japan-
ese influence. A small outpost, Naviu,
symbolises many similar areas, and its
history both before and during the war
is gradually explained through the
memory of George Beechcroft, Resi-
dent Magistrate.
Beside Beechcroft the Taubada
stands Sergeant Adisa, his right-hand
man and friend. This friendship,
although long-established, is not, and
probably can never be, complete. None
of the groups at Naviu can really reach
the others. The American missionaries,
the plantation owners, Government
representatives, and native people
some from mountain villages, some
from river districts —all fail, inevitably,
to achieve true rapport.
Complicating immediate problems is
the re-emergence of a Cargo cult
known as The Way. The original cult
hero, The Old Man of Lamon, has been
long dead, but his beliefs , are now
revived and from very mixed motives.
Indeed, the only people of importance
to the book whose motives are not
mixed are the Ramsays, plantation
owners. Ramsay is unequivocal and
stupid. His aging wife, far more in-
telligent and aware, is unable to
restrain her pig-headed husband. An
ill-advised action of Ramsay’s sparks
off the plot. Beechcroft, Adisa, and
other leaders from the groups involved
adopt positions, make decisions, act,
and investigate. Like most complicated
problems, the central one at Naviu
cannot be resolved conclusively.
Nobody “wins.” Some die or wait
retributive death. Beechcroft, certain
only of being misunderstood at Port
Moresby, whatever he does finally,
leaves the government service, as does
Sergeant Adisa. Thus exit the only two
people who have any approximately
accurate idea of all the threads of the
place.
It is a sad, inevitable tale. Most of
the reading difficulties that I mentioned
are due to the form of dialogue, which
its knowledgeable author has created
“to represent Pidgin English.” His
reasons are clearly set out in an Intro-
ductory Note and could, I feel, only be
justly questioned by a linguistically
competent critic. However, it is worth
any reader’s while to persevere. O’Don-
nell’s grasp, descriptive power, and
ability to construct a novel are unques-
tionable. His understanding of major
and minor characters is excellent.
“Time Expired” is an enlightening
book. As New Guinea approaches in-
dependence, it could prove an important
one.

Breezy Art
By SUSAN YORKE
Son Of The Great Society. Art Buch-
wald. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.
$3.85.
WASHINGTON, D.C., is currently
divided into three camps, those who
think LBJ reads Art Buchwald and
laughs, those who think he doesn’t, and
the middle group who are convinced
he does . . . and doesn’t laugh.
Buchwald takes a great deal for
granted about his readers: they must
be politically informed and up to date,
they must have a sense of humor and
the imagination to appreciate the
absurd, they must be familiar with TV
programs and modern movies.
The style of these essays is unmis-
takably today’s breezy, irreverent, often
slangy approach to the problems of liv-
ing. Ruskin and Emerson might well re-
fuse to admit it as literate English, but
the ordinary newspaper reader will be
thoroughly at home in it.
Each piece is brief, succinct, barbed.
His “Peace, anyone?” has an unfor-
gettable punch-line: “As a matter of
fact,” he writes with acid smoothness,
“you won’t find one leader in the world
today who isn’t willing to mediate a
just peace —for somebody else.”
LBJ is not the target of every essay.
That would become monotonous. Buch-
wald jibes at the latest feminine
fashions, at racial prejudice, at advertis-
ing techniques, the Draft Board, party-
giving, education, you name it and
Buchwald comments on it in a way
unique to him, invented and perfected
by him and impossible to imitate unless
you have a Buchwaldian mind, a bit
of intricate mechanism hard to dupli-
cate.
Don’t expect the reportage of strict
facts, for the Buchwald type of shrewd
observation is more interested in the
motives and oddities of the people who
created the fact under consideration. In
his “Green People Are Coming” his
Mr. Average complains that “We’re just
getting used to black people. We’re not
going to have green people forced down
our throats . . . everyone knows they’re
inferior . . . would you want your
sister . . .?” The reader has heard every
word before, possibly without as potent
a realisation of the bigotry they contain.
Have a quick look at the Buchwald
chapter headings and it becomes evident
the book is best taken in small night-
time doses to avoid indigestion, after all
one doesn’t want to die laughing. “007
and the GOP,” “Coldfinger,” “Liz and
I,” “Kennedy-Mesta or Fight,” “Anti-
Apathy Campaign.”
Mr. Buchwald is the only columnist
in Washington (so says the blurb on the
jacket of this latest collection) who has
no inside sources of information. With
a brain as fertile and unorthodox as his,
it’s obvious he needs none.
In conclusion, he is reputed to have
found a father-figure in President John-
son about whom he says: “I worship
the very quicksand the President walks
on.”
No wonder his articles appear in 350
newspapers throughout the world, in-
cluding right-to-left reading in the
Middle East and up-and-down reading
in Japan. Reading them locally, the
normal way, they are equally funny.
Playing safe
By JAMES KIRKUP
Bluff Your Way in Literature. Martin
Seymour-Smith. Wolfe Publishing
Ltd. 55c.
THIS LITTLE brochure is one of a
series of “bluffer’s guides” which seems
yet another example of that one-upman-
ship whose essential triviality and mean-
ness have so vitiated the cultural life
of our times. It instructs us how to get
the better of our fellow-writers and
how to go one better than anyone else
at that most vile of all modern institu-
tions, the “literary” cocktail party. We
are told, for example:
“You don’t have to admire Kafka
these days; but you must be ‘aware’ of
him. It is advisable actually to have read
his works (if you can get time off from
literary conversation) and to have-some
ideas of your own about what they
mean” . . .
However, in the paragraph on
“Opinions” we are warned that to have
ideas of our own is dangerous if we
want to make an impression in the
literary jungle: “Have plenty of these
opinions, but be sure they are not
consistent. There is no need to relate
them to facts, provided you are not too
extravagant . . . Don’t attempt to be
precise in advancing your opinions or
ideas: this is boring.”
Discussing the improbable theories of
two Americans who are like Virgil and
Dante in the netherworld of Yankee
criticism Wimsatt and Beardsley’s
“Intentionalist and Affective Fallacies,”
which sound like some sort of new
mechanical device—the compiler tells
us: “It is probably better just to know
what the term means and to smile about
it knowingly . . .”
Alas, one knows only too well that
knowing smirk of those who know
everything that isn’t worth knowing
But who on earth could possibly wish
to enjoy such naive little triumphs?
Apparently the entire literary cocktail
party world. And what a rancid bunch
of name-dropping, “knowing,” preten-
tious little rotters they are! The caddish
Wain-Braine drain, the BBC Lucie
poets, the Group (boring as Mary
McCarthy’s, but with not even good
looks to recommend them), the per-
fectly beastly Fence-sitters, the trendy
Neo-Georgians (whoever they may be)
and all the big Upper School bullies of
advertising and journalism, the Mucky
Jims of the Cult of the Low. It makes
one thankful to have found cultural
asylum in more congenial and sensitive
surroundings.
The incidental information the book
does supply is “old-hat”—another of
the compiler’s favorite “in” phrases. On
the surface, it is a tribute to the domina-
tion of the Critic in modern British
letters. On this matter some acute things
are said.
“Never question the value of the
function of criticism. The critic is
superior in that he is balanced. He is
there to help the creative writer to
achieve balance (prefably by stopping
him from writing), and any kind of
sarcasm or irony about critics will be
frowned upon by highbrows. The whole
point of the game you are playing
is to be a critic . . .”
Who, nowadays, could want to bluff
his way through, of all things, litera-
ture? This is to assume that literature
still has the importance of science,
technology, finance, marketing, advert-
ising, and all the other “know-hows.”
The compiler of this pamphlet doesn’t
seem to realise that literature is on the
way out, at any rate in the decadent
West. His flushed, juvenile tone is
reminiscent of a provincial grammar-
school’s Literary and Debating Club
sessions, at which “Projective Verse has
only just been “discovered.”
One derives a faint, passing amuse-
ment from the Index. Who’s out? Who’s
“in”? A curious number of Outs are
“in”—Robin Skelton, Lawrence Durrell,
William Styron, James Baldwin. How-
ever, the author writes with generous
and unusual respect of Edmund Blun-
den. What is really surprising is the
omission of so many “in” names ■—
Malcolm Lowry, Beatrix Potter, Basil
Bunting, John Lennon.
And we find a coy reference to the
compiler himself, who is, in fact, a
gifted poet with a highly origina
manner. His “Tea with Miss Stock-
port” is one of the most exhilarating
and moving (very “old-hat” word)
books of verse I have read jn a
long time. I hope this little squib is j us
a passing fling, and that he will g° 011
writing the poetry he does so well.

The Thatchers,” by William Dobell, was presented by Mr.
Holt to the Canadian National Art Collection, on his recent
to Canada. It was specially painted for the presentation
by Dobell, from sketches made in New Guinea some years
ago. “The Thatchers” is on masonite, 16in. by 14in.


LETTERS
Union with N.Z.
I think your correspondent R. W. James
hit the nail on the head when he said
(8., June 10) that resistance in New
Zealand to the concept of union with
Australia stems from misunderstanding.
However, contrary to his assertion that
the question is an anathema to all
Kiwis, there are many of us who con-
sider federation highly desirable and
who would actively support any cam-
paign in this direction.
Over recent months several articles
and letters in favor of union have been
published in local newspapers, and there
has been a singular lack of opposition
from correspondents. This supports my
contention that there is an ever-growing
body of public opinion in New Zealand
(and I understand also in Australia)
which will bring our two countries
together sooner than some think. It is
unrealistic that Australia and New
Zealand, with a common heritage and
with an identity of interest and culture,
should remain separate.

The Catholic crisis
Ever since my first rude awakening,
on my 21st birthday, in the middle of
the Mediterranean Sea (attending a
war), I have been grateful to a number
of patient people and publications
which have helped to develop an
analytical eye, extremely useful when
dealing with humans and their deeds
and misdeeds.
The Bulletin, therefore, has rated
high in my particular scheme of things,
and I found Peter Gough’s “Priests
—The Catholic Crisis” particularly in-
formative, authoritative, authentic, and
extremely well presented.
Kevin O’Neill claims (8., June 10)
“that no Catholic crisis does in fact*
exist.” All I can say is that it damned-
well ought to exist; otherwise, as Paul
Johnson wrote in “Will the Catholic
Church Survive?” (New Statesman,
January 6), “The Church, as at present
ruled and organised, seems fated to
lurch on blindly into darkness and
decay.”
Cleric M. Bull’s flippant and frothy
effusion is only too clearly the result
of his “dose of the good old-fashined
medieval opening medicine.” He should
now treat himself to a dose of the
pre-medieval eye-opening medicine of
the FOUR GOSPELS. It is the only
valid prescription in which he will find
the sine qua non of Christianily, so
aptly expressed in Father Charles Davis
phrase on leaving his church: “concern
for truth and for people.”
Thanks to The Bulletin for publish-
ing all sorts of opinions (even mine).

Interpretation
The item headed “Broad Smiles” in
the “One More Week” page (8., June
3) is an excellent example of “People
who live in glass houses . . .”
Your correspondent implies that the
PR firm concerned with publicising the
findings of the Adelaide University
fluoride toothpaste tests, by omission
of certain parts of the researchers’
reports, gave a false interpretation of
the results.
Your own article does just this. Your
correspondent, by failing to thoroughly
check his information, has given an
interpretation that could not be more
remote from the truth.
He writes that summaries of the facts
concerning dietary control, water
fluoridation, and regular dental care,
omitted in the PR firm’s Press releases
for Adelaide consumption, “appeared
more or less intact in most Australian
newspapers under such headings as
‘Fluoride Works’.”
The truth is that the Adelaide PR
firm, in which I am an associate,
handled all Press, radio, and television
releases for the whole of Australia.
Identical Press kits were sent inter-
state to 35 newspapers, 16 television
stations, and two news agencies—and
all contained at least one reference to
the full text your correspondent implies
was omitted.

More's seasons
Martin Haley writes (8., June 10) of
my article on the film “A Man For All
Seasons”: “Ross Campbell would .be
hard put to it to prove that, in breaking
with Rome, Henry ‘had the backing of
most of the country’.”
I cannot prove it, but itjs the general
opinion of specialist students of the
period. One is Christopher Morris, of
King’s College, Cambridge, who writes
in his book “The Tudors” (Fontana
edition, p. 84): “The breach with Rome
was relatively popular, or at least
acceptable, in England, whereas the
(King’s) divorce itself was not.”
Mr. Haley also questions my view
that More had some responsibility for
the burning of several Protestants. He
cites the book in which R. W. Chambers
exculpates More and lays all blame on
certain bishops. This interpretation
however, is not accepted by England’s
leading Tudor historians.
Dr. G. R. Elton, editor of the
Reformation volume of the New Cam-
bridge Modern History, says there, p.
227: “Wolsey’s secular temper kept the
persecution in check; after his fall in
1529, Thomas More, the layman who
succeeded him as chancellor, encouraged
the bishops to act.” Dr. Elton also says
in his book “Reformation Europe” that
in his later years “Thomas More
dropped criticism and free argument in
order to battle against heresy by pen
and stake.”
F. J. Lilias (8., June 17) disagrees
with my statement that Anne Boleyn
played hard-to-get with Henry VIII
arguing that she was pregnant at the
time of her marriage to the King.
While she certainly was pregnant, it
had taken Henry quite a long time to
induce her to become his mistress.
Morris, in the book mentioned above,
says: “It is clear that Anne had the
strength of will to withhold her favors
until she was sure of being, made his
queen.” The mother of Queen Eliza-
beth was an impressive young woman.

Postal charges
I notice in your political comment
(8., May 20) referring to the Postal
Charges Bill that regarding the trans-
fer of the post office to a statutory
authority your last paragraph said:
“Ironically the suggestion was made
by the Labor Party, and from his state-
ment at Thursday’s Press briefing it
would appear that the Prime Minster
is about to steal yet another of the
ALP’s ideas.”
I would like to point out that I have
made this suggestion on a number of
occasions, one as far back as
August 20, 1964, in my Budget speech,
when I said: “Some time ago I sug-
gested that the Postmaster-Generals
Department should be separated from
the Public Service and be established
as a commission. I still believe this
could and should be done. The
organisation would still have to be
under Ministerial authority, but it
could be run as a commission in the
way that many other commissions aie
administered.” _ T ,
