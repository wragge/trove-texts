“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNRY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
T" lx e Bulletl
Premier A-tietrahan Literary Journal ,
/s on/y paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One .Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
-Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A universal System of Compulsory Life
insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Ovvner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
Ihe Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. *
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper- ventures in. which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clahns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against thedark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other p«|>er, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, a.id is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bush in an of the Far North,, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the moat
popular city publication and the organ of • the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal otficia'— that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Caligraph Writing Machine\
mu
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that the platen_ of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

Australian Bards and Bush. Reviewers.
[To “Wombat” and Co.]
While you use your best endeavour to immortalise
in verse.
The gambling and the drink which are your coun-
try’s greatest curse,
While you glorify the bully and take the spieler’s
part—
You’re a clever southern writer, scarce inferior to
Bret Harte.
If you sing of waving grasses when the plains are
dry as bricks,
And discover shining rivers where there’s only
mud and sticks;
If you picture “ mighty forests ” where the
“ mulga ” spoils the view—
You’re superior to Kendall, and ahead of Gordon,
too.
If you swear that there’s no country like the land
that gave you birth,
And its sons are just the noblest and most glorious
chaps on earth ;
If in every girl a Venus your poetic eye discerns,
You are gracefully referred to as the “young
Australian Burns.”
But if you should find that bushmen —spite of all
the poets say—
Are just common brother-sinners, and you’re quite
as good as they, _
You’re a drunkard, and a liar, and a “cynic,”
and a sneak,
Your grammar’s simply awful and your intellect is
weak.
Wellington, Maoriland.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Melb. licensed victuallers complain
bitterly about the cheapness of “colonial wine”
licenses, and the absurd facility with which they
can be obtained. They say that the long-beer
drinker has become a “ colonial ” wine soaker (at
3d. a pint). Why not? The wine soaker gets
better accommodation at the wine-shop lior him-
self, and can, at a pinch, get a private room and
two pints of wine, for self and “missus,” all for
sixpence! One does not “ expect much for four-
pence,” but what can a man want more for six-
pence ?
The successful removal of Piles of th e
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “Cannalin” treatment, larjfe quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to isufferers
throughout the colonies. It is obtainable, with
advice, from 257 George-street, Sydney.
Dear Bulletin, — Be the many “ Land
Distributions” and “ Public Lotteries ” now being
advertised all over Australasia. Although great
harm may result from private gambling, and
greater still from public gaming-tables and race-
courses, the evil, after all, isn’t a millionth part
so great as the evil resulting from these “public
lotteries.’’ The persons who are ruined by ordinary
gambling are, after all, persons who would cer-
tainly be ruined by some vice or another. The
compound of avarice and excitement which makes
the attraction of hazard doesn’t allure the higher
kinds of character ; besides the vice does not
go to the player—the player goes to the vice.
Now, on the contrary, the lottery attacks openly,
and tries to allure in very despite of themselves
the much wider multitude that is the very sap
and support of a nation—it 'entices the people
themselves. It lures the workman to throw away
his wage—the student to spend his time in fanci-
ful dreams —the simple day-labourer to consume
his content in senseless calculation. The lottery
assails them in the street, is carried to them in
their homes, and perhaps drops them some poor
prize at first. It changes honesty to cunning,
peace to burning desire, industry to a perpetual
waiting on chance, and manly effort to an imbecile
abandonment to the dictates of signs and portents,
and the expectancy of a fortune which never
comes. Highborn gamblers are only the topmost
leaves of the tree of State, they may rot away
without detriment to the tree, but the lottery lays
the axe at the very trunk and root of it, because
it demoralises the people. —Yours, D. B. ROBIN-
SON, Cue, W.A., July Bth, ’94.

Premier Reid’s Policy.
The New South Wales Ministry, through
the mouth of Premier Reid, has announced
its policy, and The Bulletin bespeaks for it
a fair trial. Judging by the manner in
which the members ranged themselves at the
opening of Parliament, the new Government
has a good working majority. Even leaving
out Parkes —who probably sits behind the
Ministry chiefly because a kick from behind
is more unexpected and disastrous than one
from the front, and therefore the position of
a supporter is the one in which he can do the
most damage—and his following of two or
three irreconcileables, the Reid Ministry
should have a sufficient majority in the
Assembly for all practical purposes. Also,
the failure of ex-Preraier Dibbs’s unscru-
pulous—though no doubt strictly constitu-
tional—attempt to send seven of his own
partisans to the Council leaves some ten or
twelve nominations at the disposal of the
new Premier, and by filling the vacancies
with supporters of his Land-tax policy
he can probably come neai’er to secur-
ing a majority in the Tory Chamber
than any reformer who has preceded him.
Mr. Reid’s colleagues are, with hardly an
exception, feeble, methodical, well-meaning
men who will leave him to supply the
intellect of the Cabinet, and—unless he is
utterly devoid of all capacity for leadership
will give little trouble. And unless the
stormy and aggressive Dibbs, with his com-
pact following, goes in for a course of wanton
obstruction, the new rulers of New South
Wales should have a fair opportunity
to do all the good that is in them.
As the Opposition, however, like the
Opposition in every other country which
groans under the incubus of Party Govern-
ment, always does go in for a course of
wanton obstruction, the Ministry’s chance of
developing its policy in peace is strictly
limited. The first, last, and only purpose of
an Opposition is to get back to office at the
earliest possible moment, and the way to get
back to office is to discredit the existing
Government, and the way to discredit the
Government is to prevent it, by every
possible means, from doing anything, and
then to draw the country’s attention to
the fact that it hasn’t done anything.
Therefore, every new Premier enters on
his duties with a light heart and generally
with a large and comprehensive policy ; and
retires a while later with a damaged reputa-
tion, and a soured temper, and a political
record which consists of a few tattered little
statutes and a long list of failures.
• • •
Mr. Reid, being an entirely new Premier
and with hardly any experience of Ministerial
office, starts with an extensive programme
and a sanguine temperament. Whether he
has the constructive ability required to put
his theories into any political shape remains
to be seen. Parkes is absolutely devoid of
this power ; nine-tenths of the great schemes
which he presented so persistently for 25
years and more never came to anything,
merely because he never could write them
out in intelligible English, nor understand
them when they were written out for him.
Jennings had as little constructive capacity
as Parkes —if such a thing were possible.
Patterson and Carter, of Victoria, are
an absolute mental blank in the same
respect. Dibbs has the constructive
capacity to a limited degree. Reid —if his
programme is to be a reality and not merely a
programme —needs to have the brilliant crea-
tive faculty of John Parlance; and whether
he has any creative faculty or not is entirely
unknown. So far he has created nothing ;
but, on the other hand, he is not known to
have made an unsuccessful attempt to create
anything. His programme, at all events, is
much more democratic than his past career
would have led the public to expect. It
includes reform of the land laws—those land
laws which have been reformed more or less
by almost every Ministry for thirty years
past, and which still seem to need reform as
urgently as ever ; local government, a land
tax of a Id. in the £l, retrenchment—that
same old item without which no Ministerial
policy is complete—an eight-hour law, a
Factory Act, Federation, a State Bank, a
revenue tariff, and an income-tax. Premier
Reid is in favour of all these projects, and,
looking out through a sanguine eye-glass on
a ragged Ministry, and a solid Opposition,
and a troubled community, he seriously
expects to carry them all into effect.
♦ ♦ * *
As for the great Freetrade principle to
which, more than any other, Premier Reid
owes his accession to office, it is dead and
forgotten and utterly defunct. There never
has been any Freetrade in New South Wales,
and there is not going to be any. Premier
Reid, looking out on futurity through his
glazed optic, does not even pretend to see
the beginnings of it on the farthest horizon ;
more than that, he does not seriously profess
to desire to see it. His party has climbed
into office by false pretences on this occasion
as on every other, the false pretence con-
sisting in the assumption of the name of
Freetrade, and the impassioned advocacy of
Freetrade principles, while the reality which
lies behind these principles is entirely
neglected. The new Government announces
its intention of raising £1,500,000 per
annum by Customs duties on about half-a-
dozen articles, against the £2,100,000 raised
by its predecessors, therefore, so far as the
total is concerned, there is little difference
between them. To do this it must levy its
duties solely on articles of universal
consumption, so that the tax will fall
almost as heavily on the artizan as on
the millionaire. All the special duties
levied by the Dibbs Government on
wealth—the taxes upon imported carpets,
precious stones, porcelain, ivory, jewellery,
silks, laces, paintings, perfumery, pianos,
organs, harmoniums, gold and silver plate,
plush, and many other luxuries—are to be
abolished ; the Treasurer who undertakes to
get £1,500,000 per annum by taxing six
articles must choose articles of the com-
monest consumption to realise anything like
his expectations. Also, he must choose
articles which are not easily produced in the
province, else his duties will help local pro-
duction and thereby diminish imports and
wreck the Customs revenue, besides being
of a protective character, and he must tax
them more heavily than they have ever been
taxed before. Consequently, the blessed
features of the promised Reid tariff are that
it will not be Freetrade, that it will afford
no employment, help no Australian industry,
do nothing towards making the country in-
dependent of the outside world, and merely
increase prices and be an instrument of
oppression.
* * *
The new Premier refuses to commit him-
self to any scheme for the reformation of the
Legislative Council, and that unreformed
body will wreck his Land-tax Bill almost to
a certainty. It will also, in all probability,
wreck his Income-tax scheme as well. On
two separate occasions Dibbs attempted to
raise revenue by a tax on incomes, and in
each case the measure was thrown out by a
big majority. The cheerful obtuseness with
which the new Premier leaves this tremon-
dous snag out of his calculations says little
for his sagacity. The Council, if it is any-
thing like what it was in the days of the two
Dibbs Administrations, will gladly assist in
abolishing all the late Government’s indirect
taxes on wealth, and will then refuse to
replace them by any direct imposts, and leave
the new Premier in the lutch. It was one
of the constant assertions of the Reid party
that the two Dibbs Governments were both
profoundly gratified when their Income-tax
proposals were rejected, as they thereby
gained the reputation of having a desire to
tax wealth, and yet escaped the disagreeable
reality. Whether Premier Reid is any
more sincere in the matter remains to be
seen, there being nothing in his past career
which can serve as evidence either way.
* # *
As regards land reform, it is undoubtedly
much wanted, but as a long succession of
Governments tinkered miserably with
the land question for many years, and
only succeeded in making it somewhat
worse than it was before, it is too soon
for poeans upon this subject. The Local
Government Bill has been promised by the
same party almost every year since the early
sixties, and the fact that it is promised again
is a matter of course. With the exception
of one or two items which have been inserted
to bring it up to date, the whole Reid pro-
gramme—including the retrenchment—is
much the same programme which every
Ministry has presented as far back as the pre-
sent generation can remember. Even when
he points out that the difference between his
Ministry and its futile predecessors is that
he will carry out what they only promised, he
stands on exactly the same footing as the rest
—they all had the same difference. Every-
thing depends on whether Premier Reid is
sufficiently sincere and sufficiently capable
to enforce his policy ; if he is, then he will
be, in many respects, the best statesman
who has yet ruled New South Wales. The
country knows already that he is not a
sincere Freetrader, but as to the rest it is
ignorant. It doesn’t know what he can do,
for he has never done anything. He has no
bad record to live down, for he never estab-
lished any record. He had, until last week,
scarcely even any hasty or ill-judged sayings
to explain away, for no one took him seri-
ously enough to preserve a record of his
sayings. His whole history is that he is an
ex-civil servant, a rather weak barrister,
and a politician who never contributed one
new or valuable idea on any subject, and
that he was once, for a short time, a
very mediocre Minister in a very medio-
cre Ministry. This latter fact may mean,
as it did in the case of John Ballance, of
Maoriland, that he has the genius of a
leader and for that very reason makes an
ineffective subordinate ; or it may mean, as
in the case of tea-man Inglis, that he has no
genius at all, and was an ineffective sub-
ordinate because an all-seeing Providence
built him that way. However that may
be, The Bulletin trusts that he will be
met with no wanton opposition and no use-
less obstruction in any shape. Even on
purely selfish and party principles, obstruction
is a mistake. Many a hopelessly imbecile
politician has been blocked by an ill-guided
Opposition just when he was on the point of
giving the most complete evidence of his
imbecility, and has never again got a chance
to fully demonstrate it. The opportunity of
being a hopeless fool arrives to many men only
once in a lifetime, and many Parliamentary
obstructionists would do well to make a note
of the fact and not interrupt at the critical
moment.
Boom, and Borrow, and—Bust?
The writer once struck a Queensland town-
ship which gave him the most valuable
object lesson in finance he ever had in his
life. It was a town of insolvents, run by a
bank. Most of these insolvents were
non-producers—shopkeepers, , brokers, auc-
tioneers, agents, importers, and so on, but
they all lived in fine style, with fine houses,
horses and carriages, and consumed the very
finest brands of liquor. When the writer
came to compare local revenue with expendi-
ture he was amazed. “What do you live
on ?” he asked one. “ Oh, we live on the
Bank.” And the mayor of the township
added, by way of explanation ; “ You’re all
right as long as you get well into them.
I’m so far in now that they can’t shut
me up ; they have to keep me going,
or they’d lose the lot.” And the
way of operating was really very simple.
The town was a “boom” town, trading on
its “ magnificent future,” while three-fourths
of the population never did a hand’s turn in
the present. All they did was to buy blocks
of land at “ boom ” prices from Government
or from one another, and get an overdraft
from the bank on the security of the land to
pay for the land. Then it was only a matter
of “ getting far enough into the bank ” —an
easy matter. Those were the days of
Griffith’s Ten Million Loan—the most
tremendous curse that ever befell Queens-
land, and a curse which has now come home
to roost. The Government was borrowing
money which it did not know what to do
with, and pouring it into the banks, which lent
it out to anybody and everybody on good
security, bad security, and no security what-
ever.
m # «
So, in the particular township under
notice things went merrily. Everybody
bought land, got an overdraft, and put up a
house and a coach-house, lived expensively,
and continued to get overdraft and have a
jolly good time. The bank was quite happy,
relying on the “magnificent future,” while
the half-yearly returns showed an enormous
interest profit—on paper. It was simply
grand. The “ leading residents ” were like
one large family—a band of brothers, with
the beneficent bank as the protecting mother
of them all. You never needed money. If
Jones felt thirsty, he went into Brown’s bar
and had a whisky-and-seltzer, which was
“put down” in two senses. By-and-by
Brown would send Jones an order for
groceries—“ put down.” Smith sold Robin-
son a horse, and bought his ironmongery
—all “put down.” Once or twice a
year there was a rendering of accounts
and squaring of balances. The debtor
on balance gave the creditor a cheque on the
bank, and “justice was satisfied.” Occasion-
ally a note would come from head office say-
ing that, loss or no loss, Blank must not be
financed any further. Then Blank would
call a meeting of his creditors, who knew
that his plight might any day be their own ;
and speaker after speaker would rise with
tears in his voice to point out what a fine
fellow Blank was, and -what a splendid
citizen, and how much the town was indebted
to him for his energy in booming the
“magnificent future.” Then it v/ould be
unanimously decided that Blank’s affairs
should be wound up “ by liquidation, and not
in insolvency ” —that is to say, there would
not be an honest, out-and-out bankruptcy,
with Blank's bad debts written off for good
and all ; but Blank would undertake to pay
10s. or 15s. in the £ by bills up to 10 years",
which left his debt still figuring as an asset
in the bank ledger. Then Blank would be
unanimously voted his house and furniture,
and the incident would end in an adjourn-
ment to Brown’s bar, and whiskies all
round—“ put down” to Blank. The bank,
sinking under the weight of remorse and
the general indignation of the leading
citizens, and hoping that if Blank gob a
fresh chance he might try and meet his bills,
would start a fresh overdraft for him. and
things would proceed de novo .
• # #
By-and-by advances and interest ate up
all the security, even at boom-values—and
still the “magnificent future” had nut
arrived. The leading residents thought it
very remiss. They talked of nothing else
when they congregated in Brown’s bar—
added up their marvellous soil and their
valuable minerals, and their fine rainfall, anl
their splendid climate, and wondered where
on earth the “ future ” could be, and why on
earth it did not turn up. Every stranger
who came to the town was met with the
query—in essence, if not in so many words :
“Have you seen our future?” No ; the
stranger would assure them—he had not
seen their future ; was it a good future ?
“Magnificent!” they replied; and often
the stranger was so impressed that
he would stay and become a leading
resident himself, and assist the others
to sit down and look for it. One
stranger sold out a fine business and took
up £ll,OOO cash to invest in the future.
Where is that £ll,OOO now? “ Yhere ish
der lufly colden gloud dat float on der moun-
tain’s prow?” Interest has made but a
mouthful of it ; and the stranger is back
again at business, working hard for a living
in the present.
* * *
Now, from that township, one may learn
the condition of all Queensland, for the same
process has been followed, in greater or less
degree, in every town in the province. In
1801, came the beginning of the end.
Government credit stopped. Treasurer
MTlwraith tried to float a loan of 2|
millions in London and was offered £311,500.
After that, the deluge. When the bank
directors sat up to consider the situation,
they found they held immense quantities of
land, values steadily falling. They had used
not only Government deposits to extend their
monopoly. As the Maryborough News
says :■ —
The influx of the ten-million loan created a false
boom, which brought more grist in the shape of
deposits of English money. These deposits were used
to consolidate a banking monopoly, and tighten the grip
on the land and the great wealth-producing industries <1
the province. The great desire of the bank seemed to be
to get all the resources of the province into its own h ends.
It succeeded, alas, too well. It has gorged itself until it
is beyond its power to extricate itself from the tight place
in which it is so firmly wedged. Its creditors in England
are exacting. The produce of the whole province is no
more than sufficient to meet these demands ; and, mean-
while, the residents everywhere, as in our own district,
are being impoverished and oppressed beyond endurance.
But the bank does not dare to drive its
debtors to desperation. It is adopting every
expedient to raise values, and in the mean-
time it must keep clients going and pay
interest to its own creditors. Some ready
cash is indispensable. This is why the credit
of the people of Queensland is to be pledged
in a new public loan.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Things that are not Explained.
The Bulletin rises to draw the attention of
the New South Wales authorities to the fact
that the tote-man and the unlawful layer of
doubles are again flourishing in Sydney without
even a semblance of disguise. Some time ago
the Sydney police department, after a long
period of quiescence, took proceedings against
certain especially notorious law-breakers of this
order—why the proceedings were not taken
earlier is not explained. One gentleman—the
one whose case was first called—was sentenced
to a short term of imprisonment, and thereupon'
the alarmed horde of bookmakers arose and fled


In confusion from the Court, leaving instruc-
-3 w ith their solicitors to get the cases
Jimirned They were adjourned accordingly,
thJuU why the y adjournment was granted so
nnammously, and for no visible cause, is
her thing that hasn’t been explained.
When the cases came on again for hearing, it
discovered that the prosecutor had some-
how away in the interim ; no one
beared and no one made any special com-
ment on’his absence, or seemed in the least
anrorised, or appeared to take any further
interest in the matter. Why the prosecutor
had vanished, and where he vanished to, were
T so left wholly unexplained. The bookmaker
who was sentenced to a term in gaol promptly
£fot out on bail pending an appeal, and Ihe
bulletin has heard nothing ot him or of his
. since. While this trouble was on the whole
tribe of tote-keepers and layers of doubles put
the shutters almost unanimously, and went
to lie low in parts unknown, leaving a notice
on the front-door that the business of Moss
Uoobstein was temporarily suspended, owing
to domestic calamity. But within the last few
davs many of these notices have been taken
down and the shops have been re-opened, and
announcements have appeared in the papers
that Moss Jacobstein is once more carrying on
tablets at the old .land, and will lay the
double on the most liberal terms. And why
the police take no notice of his doings, and
allow him to thus openly insult the alleged
majesty of the law, is still another thing about
which no one has offered any explanation what-
ever.
The Borrowing Disease.
The old borrowing disease has broken out once
more in Maorilaud, the only province which
has ever had the courage to swear off—-however
ineffectually—the curse of British capital. For
a number of years Maoriland has struggled
manfully to get back to solvency after the
frantic finance of the Vogel and Grev Minis-
tries ; and, having got back, the Seddon
Government now proposes to retrograde with
all possible velocity to the old, ruinous policy,
and have another frantic “ tear,” according to
the approved Vogel fashion. This lamentable
idea confirms the impression, which has been
crowing for some time past, that John Bal-
ance "was the only genius, the only sincere
democrat, the only patriot, and the only states-
man of the late Ministry. After his death his
colleagues for a time maintained his policy from
sheer force of habit; but as his memory recedes
into the distance they must needs initiate a
policy of their own, and then the fact obtrudes
itself that Ballance’s colleagues, without Bal-
lance, are very common clay at the best. The
old longing for a boom and a violent outbreak
of “ prosperity ” lias come upon them. There-
fore, that beautiful and nicely hair-oiled person,
Treasurer Ward, has formulated a boom budget
which promises favourably to add ,£5,000,000
to the public debt in one fatal act. He pro-
poses to borrow £250,000 to buy back private
lauds for purposes of settlement; £250,000 for
road-making purposes; £1,500,000 to supply
capital for the new State Land Bank; and
£250,000 for the purpose of acquiring native
lands. Another £1,000,000 is to be raised by
the local issue, in small amounts, of 4 per cent,
consols. Insurance companies, especially
foreign companies, are to be required to make
deposits with the Treasury for the better pro-
tection of the public against bogus institutions,
and this is expected to provide the Treasurer
with a perpetual loan of £450.000 at 4 per cent.
And, in addition, £1,000,000 of the Bank of
New Zealand’s State-guaranteed capital is to be
safely invested at the discretion of the fatally-
beautiful Ward, which probably means that
it will also be put into Maorilaud consols,
and form another addition to the public
debt. Further, and over and above all this
garish finance, Treasurer Ward has suc-
cessfully “converted” certain old loans
bearing high interest into per cent,
stock, whereby the gross amount of the public
debt is materially increased while the annual
charge for interest is considerably diminished,
and, having done this, he has laid violent hands
on the sinking fund of £260,000 provided for
the redemption of these old loans, and added it
to the Public Works fund. Nothing is said
about setting aside the interest saved by the
conversion operations to form a new sinking
fund. The ghastly total of all this is
£5,000,000 more debt. The insurance scheme
is undoubtedly a much-needed reform. The
local issue of 4 per cent, consols, in sums of £5
and upwards, with the interest payable at any
post-office throughout the country, is another
excellent device, inasmuch as debentures sold on
such terms will mostly remain in the country,
instead of drifting into the hands of the foreign
investor ; and if the money so_ obtained was
employed to pay off old liabilities, instead of to
create new ones, it would not matter if ten
millions were issued instead of one. The land
policy of the Seddon Ministry is equally com-
mendable in itself ; and the State Land Bank
would be a magnificent device if the Government
had the courage to start, it with millions
of State notes, instead of I 2 millions of
J. Bull’s capital. But every one of these
projects, from the Land Bank down to the
sinking fund swindle, means more borrowing,
either openly or under a thin disguise, and
though the ends in view are excellent the means
are foolish and utterly disastrous. When the
only province which ever attempted to teach
Australasia a lesson in self-reliance falls away
so miserably, it would seem that the borrowing
disease is really hopeless and utterly incurable.
Toujours Parkes.
A use has been found for the stranded hulks on
the beach of politics. It is discovered that
there is an excellent market for banalities or
trivialities attached to the names of ex-states-
meu or other notorieties, who good-naturedly
advertise themselves while putting dollars in
the pockets of their enterprising exploiters.
The Bulletin has nothing whatever to urge
against the traffic ; but thinks it, on the con-
trary, a highly desirable thing that imperial
Cassar, politically dead and turned to clay,
should assist to patcli the breeches of contem.
porary journalism. Yet is it too much to ask
the responsible persons to respect the notice in
Australian grass, and “ Keep off the Parkes !”
Lately we have had Parkes ad nauseam;
Parses for breakfast, Parses for dinner, and
Parses for tea ; Parses as a philanthropist,
Parses as a federationist, Parses as a
grand old man, and Parses among the
ladies. He is like a recurring decimal;
and there is really nothing to be gained by
carrying the calculation of him further. We
thought we had lost him for a time ; but last
week there was an unexpected recrudescence of
Parses as a humourist advising young men to
“ put their money in safe banks,” and that
tired feeling came over us again. Indeed,
Parses is almost as bad as Sydney Telegraph
engravings. Once a politician neglects proper
health precautions, and gets Sydney-TELE-
GRAPiI-engravings, he is doomed; for it will
follow him till he dies, and after that. It
fastens on him as a candidate for Parliament, is
cast up at him as a member, and strikes him
hard when he goes up for re-election as a
Minister, and again when he is elected.
After that it lies in wait till he
makes a speech, or is married, or is a
candidate for the next Parliament, and
then it attacks him again. It is as relent-
less as the wrath of God —or as Parkes. Now,
we know the high qualities of Parkes as poet
and moralist and man ; we are quite prepared
to gaze at him, admire him, walk round him
and fool him a little—though not, emphatically
not, to the top of his bent; we are willing to
take an interest in his “declining years” on
special occasions—birthdays, say ; but we can-
not conscientiously say, “Give us this day our
daily Parkes ! ” It should be remembered that
Parkes is strong medicine—in large quantities
he enervates and cloys. Time there was a
change of venue. The Parkes want shuffling.
Permit us to pass Parkes.
Carter’s Tariff.
The new Victorian tariff—that weird and pic-
turesque curiosity which represented the com-
bined intelligence of Carter and Patterson,
and which the Sydney press hailed as evidence
of a glorious Freetrade resurrection —led a
tumultuous existence for one week, and was
then iguominiously suspended. It was probably
the most wildly-exciting week in all Vic-
toria’s history. The Protectionist organisations
in the country held meetings and denounced
the new tariff. The Freetrade organisations
did likewise, and cursed it with a whole-
souled unanimity never before witnessed. The
importers, who were supposed to be especially
benefited, protested violently almost to a
man. The Opposition leader gave notice of
a want-of-confidence motion; and many of
the Ministerialists made no secret of their
disgust and astonishment. At least two
members of the Cabinet let it be known, in a
vague, non-committal fashion, that they were
in no way responsible for Carter’s strange and
unlooked-for inspiration. Every paper in the
country blasted the new proposals more or less,
and for once the Age and the Freetrade Argus
were unanimous. The manufacturers protested
as one infuriated citizen ; so did the Chamber
of Commerce. The miners insurrected against
the 10 per cent, revenue duty on quicksilver,
wire rope, and many other articles used in their
trade. The Melbourne tobacco factories, to
which the new tariff meant absolute ruin, all
closed up and threw over 500 employes out on a
cold world. The local cigar makers, whose
goods were subjected to a duty of 2s. 6d. per
lb. (instead of 6d.) in order to boom the trade
in cheap German “smokes” made, in many
cases, by prison labour, and to help on the
Chinese manufacturers of Chicago, gave notice
of their intention to close. A meat preserving
factory, employing 200 hands, did likewise,
and so did a big clothing factory of almost
equal dimensions. Most of the other clothing,
woollen and meat factories followed suit im-
mediately afterwards. The Trades Hall, the
Warehousemen’s Association and the Vine-
growers’ Board all rose in execration. The
whole month’s import of English and American
magazines was blocked at the Customs House,
it being found that a duty had been put on
them by accident. It was further discovered
that a duty had been placed on imported
coin by accident. And then, just as the
new Freetrade development was at its most
interesting stage, the Government backed
down and the new tariff was suddenly sus-
pended, after providing a week of the wildest
comedy and tragedy ever seen in Victoria.
Any reputation which formerly remained to
Carter and James Beef Patterson has gone
in this awful experiment ; they stand revealed
as two irresponsible infants fooling around with
a candle in a powder-magazine, or two un-
lettered aboriginals trying to run a bank with
a boomerang. And the Legislature would
gladly get rid of them both without delay,
only, under the beautiful system of Government
by Contradiction, if it does so it thereby puts
Shiels into office, and it begins to vaguely
suspect that Shiels is almost as ghastly a
failure as Carter and Patterson. No doubt
he would be an improvement on that awful
pair, but he isn’t sufficient of an im-
provement to be worth the trouble of an
exchange. So the above-mentioned pair retire
to patch their gruesome budget, and will be
heard from again shortly. Whether they will
be heard fiom again as tariff-reformers, or
whether they will paint themselves bright green
and do a scalp-dance on the front bench, isn’t
known.
More Brummagem!
The reign of Brummagem continues. One of
the last official acts of the Hires Government
was to appoint to the vacant editorship of the
“Official History of New South Wales” the
dapper ex-secretary and relative of Governor
Duff, Mr. Arthur Galton. This more or less
young gentleman has now honoured Australia
with his presence for something over a year,
and, no doubt, with the assurance of the H. H.
Chamfion-Christie Murray type of British
tourist, has obtained that firm and rapid grip
of our history and traditions which marks him
above all the native-born litterateurs as the
most fitted for carrying out the task of selecting
the documents to be included in our official
history. That this appointment should be the
work of ex-Republican Dibbs is strangely in-
consistent with that gentleman’s attitude
towards Governor Duff’s alien interference
with constitutional precedent. Ihe Im-
perial wayfarer who happens to tem-
porarily occupy New South Wales Government
House has no more effect upon our history than
the regular arrival and departure of the mail
steamers. He merely conies, eats so many
meals, draws so much salary, gives so many
balls and departs. He is discounted always by
the inevitable sense of the sentiment —“ Thou
art passing hence, my brother.” So that
Dibbs’ quarrel may have little effect on history.
But Dibbs gives the power of meddling with
our historical documents into the hands of the
literary wayfarer from Britain, and with it the
power of selection of documents for publication
in the official history of New South Wales.
The power of selection includes the power of
suppression as well as of publication. There
are many passages in our history which are dis-
creditable to the authorities of Downing-street,
London. Yet a protege of those authorities, a
man enveloped with their traditions, is entrusted
with the selection and handling of all our histori-
cal documents. This work, unlike the ephemeral
acts of individual Governors, is permanent.
Now, as to the qualifications requisite for this
task of editing these documents. The public
are led to believe that Mr. Gabion has special
attributes which mark him as a fit and proper
person. It is rumoured that he once wrote a
life of Cromwell. So did Carlyle. There
were tw T o Cromwells, and as Carlyle had
used up one, Galton took the other to show
that there were not two Carlyles. He also
lectured on the Ancient Romans, with extracts
from Gibbon, and was reported verbatim in the
S.M. Herald, extracts and all. These are his
literarv records. He is reported to share with
Dibbs a coolness towards his viceregal relative,
a coldness akin to that felt by that other dis-
tinguished scholar, Hamlet, the Dane, for his
uncle, Claudius. In general, he has observed
Australia from the deck of an ocean
steamer, the windows of a first-class rail-
way carriage, and the stately towers of
Government House. As this observation has
been going on for about a year, he is, therefore,
highly qualified, according to Dibbs, to compile
our official history. Added to these towering
qualifications, he has the additional merit of
being cheap, having accepted .£5OO a year to do
the work for which <£l2oo, or thereabouts, was
previously paid. This appointment can only
be regarded as an insult to Australians, as a
degrading assumption that there is no Aus-
tralian competent to perform the task of judging
the relative importance of the historical
documents of his own native land. Dibbs
has strained at gnats and swallowed camels.
What was the refusal to appoint any number
of political deadbeats to the Upper House
in comparison with the appointment of an
Imperial straggler to manipulate Australian
documents? Perhaps, after all, the Australian
gets what he deserves. If he is content to see
all the fat billets, political and otherwise, fall
to the enterprising foreigner, if he is satisfied
to be protected by a subsidised fleet, to be
clothed with British shoddy, to have his highest
court of appellate jurisdiction in a dingy office
in Fleet-street, London —then he ought not to
grumble if his history, which he allows out-
siders to make, is also written by an outsider
of one year’s residence. The only outlook for
Jiim is to disguise himself in an English accent
and London clothing, when he may hope to
have some chance in the land of his birth
provided his identity is never betrayed.
The S.M. Herald leader which tried to prove
that, in our present system of party politics,
there is no useful place for the independent
M.P., not only urged an opinion which Parkes
holds strongl} 7 , but introduced certain extracts
from Edmund Burke which everybody knows
Parkes has by heart. In fact, the article is
just such a one as Parkes has spoken, when in
power or in opposition, fully a hundred times.
But, withal, it, if sound, only amounts to a
deadly arraignment of “ the present system of
party politics.” “Party loyalty,” says Herbert
Spencer, “ has come to be a fancied virtue to
which the real virtue of veracity is sacrificed.”
What is more contemptible than for men, as in
last New South Wales Parliament and any
number of Parliaments before it, to feign illness,
to feign business, or to invent some other false-
hood to justify absence from a division in which
they should have had to vote either for what
they knew to be wrong or against the behests
of the leaders of their party ?
Queensland has a small but increasing tobacco-
industry, which has gradually grown up with
the aid of a protective tariff. It is now pro-
posed to strangle this industry in its infancy
by imposing an excise duty of Is. per lb. in
order to raise revenue. The proposition is open
to only three objections—it taxes enterprise, it
taxes agriculture, and it taxes the poor—since
tobacco, and especially home-grown tobacco, is
particularly a poor man’s luxury. And, of
course, the tobacco-growers, being small farmers
scattered all over the country, cannot bring
such pressure to bear on the Treasury as the
ring in Brisbane, and the gorged land-mono-
polists whose aim it is to evade taxation. The
Treasurer is quite willing to impoverish the
country districts as long as he secures the sup-
port of Brisbane vested interests.
When Maloney’s Woman’s Suffrage Bill was
under discussion in the Victorian Assembly,
Frank Madden, M.L.A., delivered himself of
an original argument. “It is a well-known
fact,” said Frank, “ that when once a woman
falls she falls, like Lucifer, never to rise
again,” and on this ground F. Madden con-
siders that female suffrage is a general, all-
round foolishness and a snare. Which, by the
way, it may or may not be, but whether it is or
is not, Madden’s argument is only worthy of an
aboriginal, and not a very bright aboriginal at
that. For Madden’s theory about Lucifer rests
entirely on the Scripture, and the same Scrip-
ture tells ot a fallen woman who did rise again.
Moreover, though Madden’s theoretical ac-
quaintance with fallen women is evidently
something tremendous, he doesn’t know all the
race, and if those whom he does know never
rose any more, that might be owing to a variety
of causes. In any case, there is no “ well-
known fact ” in the matter ; all society does
know is that almost every fallen woman whom
it knows has remained down, one sufficient
reason being that society has unanimously sat
on her head and kept her down. As for the
fallen woman whom society doesn’t know about,
she probably rose again, which is most likely
the reason why society continues not to know
about her even to this day. Anyhow, the
horsey Madden seems a grotesque, not to say
coarse and hog-like, authority on such a sub-
ject, and the connection between the fallen
woman and the suffrage isn’t by any means so
obvious as it might be.
Queensland Parliamentary salaries are likely
to be increased to the old figure of .£3OO a year.
The hard-up Government supporters have got
tired of living on £l5O in the hope that it would
kill the Labour-party, and unless they can be
bribed to drop the agitation, the Ministry will
have to yield. The Labour men are used to £3
a week; but the Government tail can’t do
without the fat of the land, and it is Jack
Hamilton, a most “reliable” member, who
leads the rebellion. Premier Nelson professed
to be much shocked at the iniquity of men
voting to increase their own salaries (though he
made no objection to the Griffith job or the
Robb scoop), and said Ministers would work for
nothing “ rather than so soil the reputation of
the province.” The tail, however, who have
not the Treasury and the bank to fall back
upon, couldn’t see how this would help them ;
and Nelson’s pathos fell on flinty ground. It
was mighty foolish pathos, anyhow, since if
Parliament is competent to reduce salaries it is
competent to raise them ; and as for the reputa-
tion of the province, after the proceedings of
the gang in office for the last four years, Nelson
might as well talk of soiling the reputation of
Messalina.
Premier Patterson, at the Mayor of Mel-
bourne’s quarterly guzzle, said people who
formed their impressions of Parliament from
the newspapers were likely to be mistaken.
They can’t be more mistaken than the people
who" get their ideas of these little “ representa-
tive gatherings ” at the Town Hall, or any-
where else, from a printed report of the
proceedings. No outsider would suppose that
Mayor Snowden, rising to propose the health
of Her Majesty’s Ministers in Victoria, had to
be reminded by Patterson that he was propos-
ing that awful toast, and not responding to a
speech already made. Neither would the
outsider assume that Patterson obligingly
prompted the speaker at every fifth word,
striking himself the chief notes of the
Mayor’s oration for which he had a con-
ventional reply on the tip of his long tongue.
The reporters, those “ scribbling ” objects of
J.B.P.’s historic scorn, are silent on such
points. With their tongues in their cheeks
they employ themselves in covering these pain-
fully absurd functions with a cloak of import-
ance. The public don’t hear of L. L. Smith
shouting to His Worship—“ Whether you’re
mayor again, or not, we’ll get you into the
Legislative Council, and you’ll be one of us."
One of us ! One of the little mob that works
the Victorian oracle, and fattens upon the ignor-
ance of those who read newspapers and are so
mistaken in consequence. If Patterson had a
grain of modesty in his composition he wouldn’t
try to be funny at the expense of the grea* Sup-
Press.
Premier Patterson has performed a char-
acteristic “lightning change” of sentiment as
to the position of the Victorian Judges. Four
or five months ago, he snorted publicly at the
monstrous absurdity of expecting the Bench to
be spared retrenchment. The notion of a
Judge drawing more salary than Patterson,
for instance, brought an indignant flush to his
iron cheek. He desired to know whether these
land-boom prices for mere legal judgments and
sentences, and so forth, were to be maintained in
times of depression. The meeting didn’t seem
to respond in the manner he had expected,
neither did the country begin to whoop for this
statesmanlike suggestion, so in time it dawned
upon the Pride of Castlemaine that his intellect
had led him astray. Hear him now in reply
to an interviewer : “The Premier agreed with
Mr. Pdrves that a high, courageous and in-
dependent Bench (! !) was the very centre of
our national existence. The Judges were
altogether different from even other servants of
the State, and high above any political action.
There was no intention to propose a reduction
of the salaries of the present occupants of the
Bench.” Nor of future occupants. There are
no intentions of any kind left in Patterson.
A prime cause of the current quarrel between
squatters and shearers is the new agree-
ment which makes the squatters’ repre*
sentative sole judge of the fitness of the sheep
to be shorn. After working amicably for two
years under an agreement approved by repre-
sentatives of both masters and men in conference,
the united squatters suddenly substituted another
w r hich they are endeavouring to run down the
men’sthroatsat thepointoftheshears. Thisarbi-
rary and discreditable action has met with the re-
sistance which rnighthave been expected. Human
nature has not yet learnt under such provoca-
tion to turn the other cheek to the smiter ; and
though The Bulletin concedes that the
squatters are, like the usurer who charges 200
per cent, whenever he can get it, within their
legal rights, it denies them the ethical right to
exercise their rights. Now, to shear wet sheep
is unprofitable and most unhealthy, but there
is a constant tendency on the part of some
squatters to hurry through shearing even when
the wool is dripping; so that, as the men
tersely put it, under the objectionable clause in
the new agreement, if the sheep have just
swum across a river, and the shed boss says
they are dry, they must be shorn, or the men
are liable to lose their wages for breach of con-
tract. The squatters’ representatives have con-
sistently contended that this was all moonshine
—no employer would dream of asking his hands
to shear wet sheep. Unluckily decisive facts

contradict their assertion. Three times withi n
a few months smouldering wool has been found
In bales placed aboard English-bound vessels—
the last instance being that of the Gothic, at
Wellington, on July 22, when a fire was nar-
rowly averted. Mr. Henry Austin, a well-
known Sydney wool-broker, affirms that
“ much damp wool came to Sydney market
last season,” and buyers not uncommonly
found the inside of the bales “ like a
baker’s oven.” It is useless, in the face of such
evidence, to deny that the shearers have right
on their side, and should at least enjoy indivi-

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
August 14, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
What Melbourne society wants to know is why
Miss Asterisk, from down South, who became
Mrs. Blank, went ’Ome, and lately returned a
grass-widow to visit the scenes of her youth —why
this former Baratarian belle didn’t go through
the usual treadmill of presentation, etc., after she
landed her bridegroom. It has gone round like
wildfire that Mrs. Blank has not peeled her
shoulders and lengthened her skirts to kiss the
Royal hand, as most Baratariennes do who go
“ home ” and marry above a shop, and people
want to know whether the lady’s alleged parti-
cipation in a certain historical society kick-up,
which froze her reception at the local Guvmentouse
for some time afterwards, has anything to do with
it?
The written laws of justice ukase that a man
condones any sort of a “ past ” his wife may have
when he marries her—but are the unwritten laws
of society built on the same broad gauge, I
wonder? What I mean to say is, will some one
giddy and, after all, harmless frolic, in a remote
part of her Majesty’s dominions, keep the frisky
damsel out of H.M.’s front-parlour even when
■aid damsel has settled down into young matron-
hood ? If it will I can’t help thinking that the
“subject of this notice” must pose as an awful
warning to young, and generally well-meaning,
society maidens who now and then experience a
longing to kick over the splash-board.
Everything that a ball-committee could do-
good-looking decorations in profusion, a satin-like
floor, lively music, ton-weight bouquets all round
to the patronesses, and a regular banquet at
11 p.m.—was done by the engineers of the ball in
aid of St. Vincent’s Hospital, at Sydney Town
Hall, the other Tuesday. The people responsible
for its frostiness are t!ie ball-going citizens who
kept away perseveringly from one of the most
deserving annual charity balls, and the oldest ball
of the lot, too, now that the School of Industry
relies on a cake-fair to fill its little bag. Light-
heeled Sydney hasn’t any sympathy with antique
philanthropies, and people are saving themselves,
perhaps, for the Hospital’s ball next month, which
will nrobably be a replica of the over-crowded
F. A.B. ball when people danced the lancers on as
much floor as you could cover with your hat, and
only footballers waltzed.
But St. Vincent’s ball was only a disappoint-
ment in a financial sense—the small attendance
made the dancing pleasant, and all the dresses got
fair play. Lady Duff (in black silk draped in
cream lace) came early and was accompanied by
her two eldest daughters and the new vice regal
secretary, Mr. Pennyman, vice Mr. Galton, who,
having become N.S. Wales’stipendiary historian,
has given up the glorious privilege of being the
final authority on “ Who’s Who.” Mr. Penny-
man is a slight youth with a somewhat pale
countenance trimmed with an unimpressive
darkish moustache. He would make an ideal
bank-clerk. I can’t tell you yet whether the blue
facings suit him or not, for, squiring Lady Duff
only (by the way, they played Her Ex. in to the
Anathema which belongs properly to the Governor
alone) he didn’t wear full official fig.
Later in the evening His Ex. arrived with that
particular aide-de-camp who walks like a native
companion, and I couldn’t help noticing what
different styles there are of wearing the striped
ribbon and star that betoken the K.O.M.G.
Nearly all begin by wearing the ribbon as if it
were a locket and chain. It is only when they
get over the first fearful joy of being decorated
like a horse that has won three prizes at the show
that they begin to drape it showily about their
persons. Diagonally across the shirt-buzzum,
with the star pinned on to the coat-collar, is where
the majority pull up.
There was a fair sprinkling of pretty dresses at
St. Vincent’s ball. Miss Heather Duff wore the
nicest V.R. frock —pink silk trimmed with silver
gimp ; Mrs. Robert Peudergast, in ivory brocade
with dark-green sleeves covered in cream lace, a
cluster of crimson roses on the right shoulder and
handsome diamonds, out a neat figure in the
kaleidoscopic throng;golden-haired Mrs. (General)
Hutton was in blue silk. The severity of the
dresses assumed by one or two socially prominent
ladies looked as if they had progressed in taste
from the days when they used to get costumes
made out of violently-brocaded window curtains ;
yet to wear all white or all black at a time when
rainbow-tints are de rigueur always looks to me
like a confession of weakness—as if the wearer
were playing for safety 1 There were several sar-
torial enormities on the floor, and I can’t think
why a society girl in white satin had trimmed
herself in a fitful trickling sort of way from the
throat downwards with bright pink flowers. I
never saw anything more suggestive of pulmonary
hemorrhage in the whole course of my life.
Can anybody tell me whether it’s the latest snip
to sit on the floor? or are chairs still fashionable as
media for the support of one’s person? because, at
St. Vincent’s Ball, first His Ex. sat nursing his
knee on the shallow steps of the dais, and then I
observed Mrs. Hutton doing exactly the same
thing—no, not exactly, for she nursed her bouquet
instead. I have seen young and skittish society
maidens sprawling on the dais steps before
now—but when it comes to the Governor and the
leading society lady kicking over the traces of
official deportment, I wonder “like the old ladies
do, as to what we’re all a-comin’ to.”
And yet, in other ways, local society (I mean the
real Jamaica with a dash of officialdom about it)
becomes more punctilious every day. For example,
some itinerant female cordon bleu gave a culinary
seance in Sydney the other day at which Lady
Duff was present and “Miss Granville represented
Mrs. Hutton.” Though, mind you, I don’t regard
this as a sample instance of nice punctilio now I
come to look at it. Most society women who value
their digestions would prefer to send an under-
study to a cookery show, from which the front
row of patronage never can escape without tasting
the exhibits on the end of the fork.
What do you think is the very latest frisky
notion in hosen ? Stockings with pockets in them.
Little pockets up near the knee, and bearing
mottoes of a more or less familiar and encouraging
character woven round about, none of which I
would venture to repeat, for the world is always
so suspicious of double-meanings in everything.
Of course, the pocketed stockings won’t catch on
to any great extent —at least, I hope not. The
models I saw were made of silk—red and dark-
blue, with a little red pocket—and if any average
woman innocently buys them, with the idea that
they’d be handy for tram-tickets, the result will
be better than the ballet when the guard cornea
round.
Talking about stockings (a thing no well-regu*
lated girl ever does in public), I want to say that
the new Sterling Stainless hose are the neatest
things in leg-wear I have' yet come across. I
couldn’t oorne across them sooner, by the way,
because they are the very latest thing—a latter-
day boon in hosiery, doing away with the danger
to the skin, and discomfort of having your “ daisy
roots ” dyed the hue of your coloured stockings.
’Tvvas a medical man who “drew my attention,”
as Mr. Parkes says, to the Sterling Stainless
stockings, which are obtainable, I suppose, from
all decent Australian drapers—l know I got them
easily enough. You can get stainless silk gloves,
too, from long eights to babies’ noughts, and the
mere idea of a cool glove that won’t dye your
hands is a pleasing thing, when you reflect how
the vast Australian continent perspires as one
individual for six months out of the twelve.
“Ma’mzelle Nitouche,” at Sydney Lyceum last
Saturday, must have kept Nellie Stewart’s dresser
on the kangaroo jump, for Nellie’s changes of
costume were frequent and free, so to speak, all
through the Frenohy little mixture—a veritable
theatrical souffle, bothering nobody’s mental diges-
tion. Between her first blue frock of a oonvent-
s-'hool girl (when any intelligent observer spotted
Nellie Stewart at once by reason of her petticoats
being ten tucks shorter than any of the others)
and her return to that becoming garment in the
last scene), Nellie’s most effective dress wasn’t a
dress at all in the paper-pattern sense; only an
oriental drapery of rainbow silk and sequins over
the wearer’s birthday suit, apparently. Every-
body knew it was silk fleshings, of course, but,
still, the effect was very nautchy and also very
nice.
Florence Young, in a lobster-salad costume
split up to her hip, and with her garters tied round
her elbows, made her first appearance this season
as “Oorinne, an actress,” in the green-room
scene. I would like to point out, by the way, for
the benefit of gilded and very young youth, that
in many Australian green-rooms I have been but
never in one like that. The green-room of real
stage-life is generally a stuffy cavity about the
size of an adult packing-case, and in it the chorus-
girls off the chain for the moment sit knitting
babies’ socks and conversing in stifled whispers, as
if the corpse were lying in the next room. I have
often noticed that green-rooms as big as ball-
rooms, conveying the idea of perpetual champagne-
and-oysters, and diamonds as big as saucers for
the golden-haired habitues thereof, are peculiar to
the stage—as peculiar as the preternaturally
virtuous heroine. Like the girl with the curl on
her forehead—when the stage is good it is very
good indeed, and when it is bad it is horrid.
That somewhat diffident baritone, Mr. Wallace
Brownlow, who chortles bravely on in spite of a
cold which keeps him speechless all day, made a
gorgeous appearance as what Talmage would call
a lootenant, and added a boarding-girl’s dream of
a black moustache to his other fatal attractions.
By the way, another difference separating t’other
from which is that, whereas Ryley’s Byronic eye
never could tear itself away from the boxes, the
eagle glance of W.B. soars past them to the gods.
Perhaps, though, when Paul Jones’ medicine-
man lets him go loose among society tea-oar ties,
his wink will stop half-way, too.
After the musical absurdity came what every-
body was waiting for —the living pictures, and I
couldn’t help thinking that anybody on the war-
path after frocks would find a great absence of
material in the tableaux. But don’t let Sydney
society dai’e to say they’re improper 1 The big
circle at Sydney Lyceum was filled from end to
end with the very best we’ve got (including Mrs.
(Captain) le Poer Trench, nie Miss Nellie Cox
(who is taking her little sister back to England
with her on a six months’ trip), and all were abso-
lutely glued to their chairs until “ God Save the
Queen.” Not an opera-glass flinched, nor did a
blushing damsel take refuge in reading her pro-
gramme upside-down after the manner of the
genuinely embarrassed, so if Darling Point says
it’s dreadful after that everybody will be forced to
the conclusion that Darling Point prefers it close
to the knuckle.
From a sartorial standpoint, there is little to say
on the pictures ; for poseuses must certainly fly
light in the matter of wardrobe. One layer of
extensile fabric, either pink or pipe-clayed, and a
yard or so of gauze, was the drapery of most of
the poseuses, who were mostly shapely beauties
unadorned in almost the literal sense of the
phrase. All the same, I wasn’t completely para-
lysed at the latest London novelty. “Venus”
hadn’t a goddess’s profile, and some of her real hair
was revealed under the whitewash. Then, the
handsome Mona Rathbone was unsuitably placed
as Will-o’-the-wisp. Imagine a Will-o’-the-wisp
weighing about 11-stone, and lying back on the
top of feathery grasses with a mocking smile and
sleepy, disdainful eyes ! Miss Mona, as a woman,
looked all that was seductive and alluring, but I
must confess that I thought her overweight for a
Jaok-o’-Lantern. Marie Rathbone’s prettiest
poses were Psyche (in a singlet) at the well, and
the Fairy of the Moon, with stars twinkling in
the blue —though, in my barbarian ignorance, I
thought no movement was allowed in living
pictures. Most of the models stood like pillars
of salt for immobility. Nobody sneezed. Faint
music murmured, and a fat man behind me said,
with a contented sigh, that it reminded him of
Paree._ From his remarks he seemed to have,
while in Lutetia, spent most of his pocket-money
at the Moulin Rouge.
East Sydney Rowing Club annual ball at West’s
rooms, the other evening, was a most enjoyable
affair. The secretaries, Messrs. Aokland and Hill,
kept things bouncing all the evening, and Mr.
Terne, as hon. sec., must have viewed his work
with pride. Most of the dresses were new and
neat, and the supper, d la fourchette, was very
artistically served up. And, talking of hops,
reminds me that the Sydney half-squadron cavalry
hold their annual ball in the Paddington Town
Hall on 22nd inst., which the secretary informs
me Gov. and Lady Duff and suite, and Major-
General and Mrs. Hutton, are patronising, and
will attend.
The ceremonious opening of the new and palatial
Sydney Hospital, in Macquarie-street, by ex-
Premier Dibbs on Friday, 10th instant (aren’t the
Hospital authorities superstitious?), wasn’t quite
the usual sort of opening, because it was the first
one I, at all events, remember when a Governor
in full working order, with his flag flying, wasn’t
even asked to do the golden-key trick. Vice-regal
matters must be in a perilous state when an ex-
Premier is unanimously accorded the star part
and his Ex. isn’t encouraged to come along and
cheer with the rest of the audience ! I under-
stand that Gov. Duff is “not at home” when Mr.
Dibbs calls; likewise, that Mr. Dibbs is now
always “hout” to his Ex.
Otherwise the opening was common-place enough
—a pushing crowd—optimistic speeches from the
broad and easy flight of steps—and the opening of
the big door which almost every Sydneyite sound
in wind and limb frequently hopes will never
open unto him, nicely carved (allegorical of what
will happen to some of the patients, I thought 1)
and frescoed as it is. A bit of premeditated side-
play was when Mr. Dibbs before turning the
golden key asked the two ladies nearest him to
kiss it for luck. But the crowd is never satisfied.
“Kissing the key indeed,” said a disgusted
feminine voice behind me, “I’d rather kiss the
Premier.”
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
i _ Melbourne, August 14.
The widow of a munificent Melbournian, who
perpetuated his high-sounding surname by certain
University endowments, is said to be again turn-
ing her fancy to thoughts of honeymoon. The
departed one was a widower when she married
him, as testified by the gorgeous stained-glass
window in a Toorak tabernacle to the memory of
his First Love, which used to impart a distressing
yellow tone to the complexion of his second when
she prayed in its vicinity.
No one expected, perhaps, that the good man’s
loss would prove irreparable, but it is a coinci-
dence that his successor-elect, a pious bank-
inspector, is not only another widower but one of
doubly-dyed disadvantages, inasmuch as twa
angel brides await his coming in the Spirit World.
Some people are hardly treated by Fate. Why
should an attractive woman play second fiddle to
the end of the chapter? In a novel, a widow so
winsome and well-dressed, would bestow herself
upon an impecunious hero of her girlish days and
live happily ever afterwards.
Old ladies say that widowers make most con-
siderate husbands, on the “ wish-I’d-been-nicer ”
principle. Does the same recommendation apply
to widows, I wonder? Someone, who has tried
the experiment, says “iVb; they’re always com
paring you with the other fellow 1 ” And hi a
weary air suggests that he envied t’other fellow the
distance which lends enchantment to the lady’s
view. Of course, some people don’t shrink from
the thought of a matrimonial predecessor. No
sooner does a visitor cross the threshold of a cer-
tain fashionable suburban villa than the Man of
the_ House leads him off to see the valuable theo-
logical library, “ willed to my wife by her first
husband, the Rev. Blanky Blank.”
A similar case is that of a certain northern lady
addicted to open-air preaching. Guests at her
hospitable board are entertained (I believe) by
minute accounts of the sayings and doings of
“my husband in Heaven.” Her fleshy spouse
occasionally interrupting with meek ejaculations
such as “Did he, Ma?” “Just like him, Ma!”
“ You don’t say so, Ma 1 ’’ etc.
One afternoon this vassal and his liege lady
were holding a temperance meeting at a street
corner. Someone in the crowd shouted—“ What
would you do if you heard Mac was in a pub?”
“I'd follow him,” thundered “ Ma,” fixing an
awful glance on the imaginary culprit, “and in
the presence of his drunken companions I’d catch
him by the hair of his head and drag him to hia
home—that’s what I’d do, and what every wife
worthy of the name would do 1”
At the Salon, the other day, a lady read a paper
(by Professor Somebody, or other) on Luxury.
Luxury, it seems, is all a matter of circumstance.
To a millionaire railway-tourist, a footwarmer, by
force of habit, has become a necessity, and to
deprive him of it would be more reprehensible
than to rob a pauper of his blanket. The latter
(poor wretch) hasn’t invariably possessed the extra
covering, so it is really a luxury to him and, as
such, should be dispensed with.
To the beggar brat, a penn’orth of lolly-pops is
more of a luxury than a 10-guinea bonne-bouche
to the gourmand. Hence, if you’re going to do
away with superfluities, retrench the gutter-snipe
first. Them’s Salong sentiments.
The “ rational-dress ” scheme fights for life, and
in spite of the brutal revelations of the Maoriland
wedding-portrait, some women still advocate
divided skirts. The latter, they say, are more
secretive as regards ankles when their wearers are
getting in or out of vehicles, &c. But, after all,
when it comes to a regular upset, it’s six of one
and half-a-dozen of the other. This was apparent
in a recent ladies’ bicycle race. As the competi-
tors tripped on to the course they all looked
palatable (as I heard a man express it) in neat
fcnickerbocker suits, while to one of their number,
a tall, fair girl, the costume was pre-eminently
becoming. They had scarcely started, however,
when “ Beauty ” came to grief. Her machine
capsized, and she was involved in its fall, though
she hadn’t the luck to be buried from sight
beneath the ruins. A woman, astride on a fallen
bicycle, with her boots wildly beckoning for
assistance, is not a pleasing spectacle, whether she
wears petticoats or bloomers.
The original Dion B.’s brother, old editor Bour-
oicault, who died in Sydney lately, leaves several
charming daughters, all well known in the most
select Melb. circles and remarkable for good looks
inherited from their still handsomer mother. The
latter, who is exactly like one’s conception of a
dowager duchess, last came into notice as witness
in a court case, arising out of a dispute with a
fashionable Melb. oostumi&re over the fit of a
Derby gown.
Long ago, when pater Bourcicault ran a paper
up North, every man who came to the district
succumbed to the charms of his graceful daugh-
ters. But ambition was a family failing, and few
of the bachelors who strayed as far as the back-
blocks township came up to the standard of
elegibility. Two of the sisters are now dashing
Melb. matrons, while a younger one (a protegde of
Chief Justioess Madden’s) is at present cultivating
her voice in Europe.
The petitioner in a sensational divorce-case is
remembered as a pretty school-girl, with large
black eyes, rosy cheeks and the extensively-curled
fringe of ten years ago. Though brought up in
the Wesleyan way she should go, she turned a
deaf ear to any number of good young men who
taught in Sunday-schools, and at “ silly seven-
teen,” contrary to parental advice, wedded the
medical gentleman who is said to have prescribed
such large doses of beer for his nerves.
On the first night of the Madden tableaux, the
Alexandra scintillated with fashion from stalls to
gallery, and reeked with the odour of scented
programmes. The Governor, in gold buttons,
managed to sustain a wooden smile until the final
bar of “God save the Queen.” That stimulus
removed, he relapsed into reverie. Even the loyal
beams of Judge Madden failed to warm his Ex.
up again, and the Mayoress, hovering timidly
near in cream brocade, only accentuated the lone
lornity of his vice-regal state.
The tableaux were effective in their little way,
and less suggestive of the waxworks than most
shows of the kind.
In the “Belle of the Ball,” a dashing society
matron posed in the name - part, and very
much at home she looked ; though the “ Ball,” or
that section of it presented in the picture, was a
more staid and stately function than some she
wotted of. Which recalls another dame (of the
same olan as the tableau heroine) who, when
Kitchen Lancers were popular, won general
acclamation for her agility in those terpsichorean
high-jinks. It was a sicht for sair een to see her
pale blue satin train madly sweeping the rear
distance like a tidal-wave, while in the foreground,
where all drapery encumbrances were gathered up
well out of the way, the dancer’s satin shoes and
silken hose, matching her gown in colour, careered
and whirled until, to the dazed onlooker, they
conveyed the impression of two blue devils run-
ning amuck.
Dr. O’Hara sang the “Three Fishers” with
good effect. He even performed the feat of put-
ting some quite new wine into his ancient bottle,
(meaning the ballad, not the doctor) and rendered
the “harbour bar’s moaning ” with eerie pathos.
Talking of antiques, the potentate of an Aus-
tralian colony is said to cherish a grudge against
a local dame, who incessantly warbles that dole-
ful ditty, “Oh fair dove, oh fond dove 1” The
culprit is death on “expression,” but fails in
■enunciation, and at the end of every verse wails
in a throaty voice something like “But it Zoned
and moaned and GROANED!” Her distin-
guished auditor has come to loathe the perennial

Lr demise, the widower took a dose, but was
stored by speedy medical intervention. He is
engaged once more, I hear, and Ido trust the
Lfykoines of a tough family, for who could
Inswer for the consequences of another under-
taker’s bill upon a highly-strung nature?
Art is long, though love is fleeting. When the
nurse reads that faded letter its beauty and pathos
st 11 melt her to tears (she says), though the sorrow
expressed therein has long since gone the way of
all grief— except our Gracious Queen’s.
At a recent luncheon, Lord Hopetoun declared
that no one would be better pleased than he when
the Countess was once more performing hersocial
duties All of which Ido verily believe. What s
the good of a fragile lord possessing a robust,
braw'-boned partner, if sprained wrists, m]ured
ankles bruised ribs and fractured noses constantly
fly in the face of Providence, leaving the weaker
vessel all the work to do ? _
A Scottish sculptor, who lost an infant child,
relieved his feelings by carving a marble figure of
a sleeping baby. The little statue so truthfully
expressed the idea of dead innocence that sad
mothers often wept over it in its niche in the
church porch. Time passed on, and the father
sold the original to a connoisseur for 100 guineas,
and made a replica for the vacant corner. ( Vide
Nat. Hawthorne in “Our Old Home.”)
The first of the female amateurs, who sang at the
Madden entertainment, was chiefly remarkable
for the contrast between her fair fresh girlish face
and her matronly figure and sombre garb. In the
ease of a maiden who always dresses ten years
older than her mother, mourning is woful beyond
expression.
In the “Reconstruction ballet ("Vicar of
Bray”), by Mrs. Green’s pupils, lingerie consider-
ations obtruded themselves more aggressively
than with an ordinary professional ballet. Per-
haps amateurs are not quite so expeditious as the
latter, but the other night, instead of merely being
conscious of a sort of giddy whirl of underlying
lace skirts, I found myself idly wondering why
the dancers, like the Pharisees, made so broad
their phylacteries, while two girls on my right
eagerly discussed the point as to whether torchon
lace or nainsook frills predominated amongst the
high-toned coryphees.
Apropos , the most expensive of Melb. drapery
firms resoundat present with the joyous clack of
thimbles and the delirious whirr of sewing-

activity is a gorgeous trousseau, in course of con-
struction for Miss Thornley, daughter of Hon.
Nathan Thornley, M.L.O.
The last bridal outfit of any consequence made
at the big shop was for Miss Bell, of South Melb.,

The opera of “ Mdlle. Nitouohe ” and the
tableaux vivants which followed ib made up the
brightest, giddiest show which Sydney has seen
for a long, long time. The Lyceum was crowded
to the uttermost, and when a vague rumour went
about town that the tableaux were simply too
awful for anything, and that the police would
probably shut down on the show, the rush became
so awful that some owners of reserved stalls were
offered 15s. each for their tickets. A large police
inspector made intermittent appearances in the
circle as a guarantee that the h’i of the law was on
the look-out; the Social Gimlet brigade was well-
represented, and the supply of respectable elderly
gentlemen who had grown up through their hair
was tremendous.
• • •
“ Mdlle. Nitouche ” proved to be a bright
little musical comedy, which is a little “ steep ”
in places, bub contains nothing absolutely dread-
ful. It concerns a serious-minded organist em-
ployed in a convent, who writes a wicked comic
opera on the quiet; and a demure young lady
pupil who insists on being taken to the theatre to
see ib. The wretched organ-grinder, under threats
of exposure, consents, and the pair have a
hilarious orgy. The young lady gets rid of
the prima-donna and takes to the stage herself,
and drinks champagne, and winds up by having
supper with the local military, and dresses herself
in uniform; while the organist gets drunk, and
being mistaken —by an inebriated corporal who
has just emerged from among the coals—for a
recruit, has his hair cut short and is otherwise
maltreated. The pair get back to the convent in
their uniforms early next morning, and explain
things feebly and ineffectually to the boss nun.
‘‘Mdlle. Nitouohe” is a farcical comedy of the
wildest order, set here and there to little bits of
exceedingly pretty music. Miss Nellie Stewart
and Lauri —as the organist—are the life and soul
of the play. Miss Stewart’s drum solo shows that
the fingers of the little drummer-boy of old have
lost none of their cunning, and a particularly
desperate song and dance, or rather song and
rush around, in which she and the musician first
fall away from the holy calm of their past life, is
a matter to be remembered. Wallace Brownlow
was hoarse on Saturday night but is otherwise
acceptable as a beautifully upholstered lover ; and
Howard Vernon has no music in his part hub
pervades the piece generally. Also, Miss
Florence Young looks very fetching. A dance,
in which four ladies throw their adorable feet to
dizzy heights, and reveal more underwear than
was ever seen before in the Lyceum since that
respectable house was built, is thrown in without
any extra charge.

The living pictures were a dream of loveli-
ness Set in a huge gilt frame. They went up in
an ascending scale of dazzle until they culminated
in a maiden “ mid nodings on ” sitting on a rustic
bridge along with a dog. Her back was to the
audience, and it counted her vertebrae with dread-
ful intentness. Presumably this vision’s back was
attired in flesh-coloured tights, but they looked so
real that the audience had to take them for
granted, and there was always a weird possi-
bility that the vision, knowing the audience
couldn’t really tell whether they were there or not,
and being pressed for time, had taken them for
granted herself. The other visions had more or
lesson, and were equally beautiful in their various
ways. When they were over, the audience felt
that, for once, it had put in a really satisfying
evening, and was filled up with assorted loveli-
ness. Also, there was a vague regret that the
police hadn’t risen up and stopped the show just
when the revelations were all over, and there was
no more to be seen.

Mr. Arthur Garner’s co. started the second
week of a rather gaunt and bony season at Sydney
Criterion with “Friends,” which is a good deal
fresher than its predecessor, “Dr. Bill.” More-
over the 00. has settled down to its work, and
plays much more effectively, and it is considerably
strengthened by the reappearance of the stupen-
dous Garner himself, whose 2601b5. of meat looms
up in the part of Dawson, and blots out the land-
scape with its vastness. Mr. Garner hasn’t grown
in the least rusty during his long absence, nor
does he seem to have become any older than he
was a generation or two ago. He is still an
excellent comedian, and but for the greatness of
his circumference he looks as if he could shine in
any line of stage business. But he is too im-
pressive for knockabout comedy; Garner in
an exciting part which involved much rush-
ing around, would tread all the stage furni-
ture into matchwood. He would make good
avalanche, however, or a most convincing
landslip, and he could represent the downfall of
Poland to perfection. The rest of the little com-
pany is satisfactory, save that the imposing Miss
Edith Blande—one of the few women on the Aus-
tralian stage who can profess to be Garner’s
wife without looking ridiculously like his infant
daughter—plays her part in rather a ragged
fashion. Messrs. Diver, Kelly and Hans Phillips
are all equal to their parts, and Miss Hilda Fraser
gives a pleasant rendering of a character which
is mainly smile and white frock. Altogether,
Garner’s show deserves far better luck than it has
been blessed with so far.

The dismal weep of Miss Watts-Phillips
still pervades the “Lion’s Heart” at Her
Majesty’s, and she casts off the wicked colonel
nightly, and retires to her dungeon in a manner
that reflects the greatest credit upon everybody
concerned. The principal outrage on probability
is the downfall of the wicked colonel in the last
act, which collapse is brought about through the
unsupported assertion of a dying cripple. The
cripple is carried in by Geo. Rignold, and
states that the colonel is really a notorious
criminal who made away with the real officer
many years previously, and has_ person-
ated him ever since. This statement is listened
to with breathless interest, and then, after
an awful pause, the colonel is arrested and run
in. The situation is as impressive as if a Domain
loafer entered N.S.W\ Parliament and stated that
Speaker Abbott wasn’t himself but another person,
who had secretly murdered the real Abbott and
assumed his chair and his wig without anybody
noticing the difference. Then the Speaker would
naturally be seized on the spot, and Abigail would
be instantly released on general principles, and
Major-General Hutton would strike an imposing
attitude in the background. “ My Jack ” is
promised next Saturday.

Miss Hilda Spong, who is steadily making
her way in popular favour, had a benefit last week
at Sydney Criterion. The event came off too late
for any serious notice in this issue, but, according
to popular report, the financial results promised to
be satisfactory to the young lady’s exchequer.
The Spong season at the Gri. had the misfortune
to leave off just when it began to be a paying con-
cern, and also just about the time when
Miss Hilda’s resemblance to Essie Jenyns
began to be apparent, so the benefit pro-
bably came in at the right time. By way of
further accentuating her resemblance to the
vanished Essie, Miss Spong billed herself for the
balcony-scene in “Romeo and Juliet, with Mr.
Plimmer, instead of Plain Bill Holloway, as
Romeo. The new man was a decided improve-
ment ; still, a really beautiful and dreamy-looking
Romeo with a soulful expression is one of the
long-felt wants of the Australian stage just now.

The Bulletin prints on page 14 ot
this issue a picture of Miss Ada Baker. When
Miss Baker played Hollee Reetee in “ The Nautch
Girl,” in India, she managed to surround that
unattractive name with much magic. Of course,
India is a long way off ; but Miss Baker is going
to try and be charming in Australia also.

Sydney School of Arts hall, which suffers
from so many erratic openings and shuttings, _ is
occupied at present by Harry Barrington s min-
strels, who look moderately permanent, so far.
The 00. includes many names which recalls the
old days of Colonel Fred. Hiscocks’burnt-oorkists,
among them Horace Bent —he of the oleaginous
voice—Dave Gardiner, Martyn Hagan, and Miss
Priscilla Verne. A few years ago it would have
been an excellent spec., but the best days of
nigger-minstrelsy are past in Sydney, and the
African humorist is an uncertain investment in
these times.

The enterprising Darrell reproduced him-
self at Melbourne Royal on Saturday, as the hero
of his latest drama, “ Crimson Thread.’ George,
in this instance, is a pretty tinted detective from
Scotland Yard who comes over to Chicago for the
purpose of avenging a murder committed 23 years
earlier. He is likewise on the track of a long lost
heiress, but the heiress seems a small matter com-
pared with George’s solemn duty to the dead. His
immediate business is to obtain proofs of Charles
Holloway’s guilt, wherefore he pervades the
vicinity of that desperate looking man and lights a
cigar with calm Darrellian deliberation every time
he picks up another link in the chain of evidence.
Whilst George is collecting links Holloway
slouches around with two blood-stained hands
in the pockets of his pants threatening to kill
the first dog that plays him false. On one
occasion a member of Holloway s gang stabs
George through the lungs and liver and
George pretends that he is by falling
lifeless on the margin of a tank-river, for-
tunately the heiress strays on to a railway-bridge,
in order that she may avoid a passing tram by
dropping herself carefully into the 10,700 gallons
of tank water. Then George plunges into the wet
and rescues the dripping lady amidst wild
applause, although he might more easily have
hked her ashore with an umbrella-handle. One
of tho Chicago constabulary fires skywards and
lodges a bullet in Holloway, with the result that
he removes his hands from his pockets and con-
fesses that the real heiress is not somebody else, so
George, from Scotland Yard, betroths himself to
.£lO,OOO a year and explains that the Crimson
Thread bears some mysterious relation to the
famous Silken Bonds.
• * *
“ The Crimson Thread ” is not the worst
of George Darrell’s contributions to dramatic
literature, but it is one of the leastexciting. His
minor characters are burdened with more than
their usual allowance of ancient dialogue, and
George himself is guilty of some terrible attempts
at philosophy when he should be doing great deeds
on horseback, or crawling up to the enemies guns.
He certainly clambers down a fire-escape, and
soaks himself in the tank, and kicks innumerable
desperadoes in the stomach; nevertheless,
there is a lot of George wasted, so to
speak. Miss Maud Williamson gives an air
of reality to a decoy lady, although her
fetching American accent breaks down completely
when she turns penitent, which makes her reforma-
tion a matter for regret. Miss Gladys Heigh
speaks her lines and tumbles into the WVUO
gallons with much sincerity ; also, George Mel-
ville, J. Sweeney, Cathcart and others put in
claims for charitable consideration. Miss Alice
Deorwyn talks freely in an irrelevant character
which Miss Polly Emery might have rescued from
derision.

At the Alexandra they are renewing old
bills for brief terms, preparatory to setting up
“ Missing at Lloyd’s,” a coffin-ship story of thril-
ling interest, on Saturday next.

“Mrs. Tanqueray” is about to close her
esteemed season at the Princess’s. Her last tussle
with Saint Ellean, and her final impulse to give
Tanqueray a good, hard knock, will occur on
Friday, and it is hoped that the management will
then take the opportunity to mention what Paula
died of. The cause of decease is bound to come
out at the inquest, anyway, unless the doctor,
who figures in the first act only, can be persuaded
to inaugurate another friendship with the widower
by giving him a certificate. On Saturday the B.
and B. company appear in “Aunt Jack,” a farcical
comedy new to Australia.

Talmage is announced to deliver three
addresses at Melb. Town Hall, commencing to-
night (Thursday), and Brother R. S. Smythe
wishes to impress upon the ungodly the fact that
these addresses are not sermons. Yet there seems
to be a certain religious significance about the
hasty withdrawal, pro. tern., of two wandering
evangelists, one of whom has retired into the
interior, whilst the other has become indisposed.
Evidently they suspect Smythe’s apostle of a
tendency to lecture the Wor-r-d.
** * *
Also, at the Town Hall, on Tuesday (21st),
pretty Miss Ethel Haydon will take a complimen-
tary concert to cheer her on her way to Europe.
The same building deserves to be crowded a week
later (28th), when Mrs. Palmer, who has never
grudged her services in aid of any other good
cause, will figure as the beneficiaire in a specially
large and hearty entertainment. After 29 years
of professional fame and prosperity, this lady is
now suffering the fate, it is said, of all honest
people who placed their trust in Melbourne banks.

The Melbourne Opera Club amateurs
intend to repeat their respectable “Gondoliers”
performance at the Bijou on Saturday, and two
more nights next week. Compared with the
Lyric Club displays this is a highly finished enter-
tainment, and it will probably yield a profit. The
Cogill Bros., after a fruitful season here, return to
the little Gaiety Theatre below on Saturday, the
aforesaid Gaiety having been re-decorated and re-
christened as the Oxford. The minstrel mind
seems to discover hidden virtues in such changes
of name. At the Alhambra they have arranged
to produce Harry Rickards on the same evening.
Rickards, it seems, is “resting” after an arduous
season at Sydney Tivoli, but why he should come
to the Alhambra to find rest is not very apparent.
The Lynch Bellringers are likewise resting at th“
Athenaeum and suburban halls.
** * *
The stage- morality discussion in Melbourne
has been done to death by the advts. B. and B.
published a greasy quotation from Rev. George
Walters’ sermon on Mrs. Tanqueray, and followed
it up with another religious notice: “ The Last
Words of this marvellous work are, ‘lf I’d only
been merciful!’ ” At the same time time, George
Coppin was commending “ George Barnwell ” to
parents and guardians, and Dan Barry dilated
upon the blessedness of the maxim, “ It’s never
Too Late to Mend.” Then Dan crowned the
edifice of managerial humbug with a solemn re-
ference to poor old “East Lynne,” which was
intended by Providence to teach “ the terrible
retribution that overtakes the sinner who dares
to break the solemn mandate of the Seventh
Commandment.” Coghill Bros, are cudgelling
their brains to discover a reason why every clergy-
man should recommend their variety show to
mothers and daughters. Also Frank Clark would
like to know whether a blackened corner-man has
any Bible application to the widow and tho
orphan.
** # *
The irrepressible L. L. Lewis, of the
“ Helping Hands ” amateur entertainment co.,
wrote to the Melb. newspapers lately, stating that
the difficulties which threatened to interfere with
his final performance had been “ happily over-
come.” Also he announced that there would be a
grand triple bill for this great occasion, a bill that
“should fill the Temperance Hall.” The combina-
tion of charity and conceit in this “Helping
Hands ” business has been remarkable throughout.
But all amateur shows for a good cause are full of
vanity. Disengaged pros, would be quite willing
to contribute a far more attractive performance if
the hon. sec. and the hon. director and the rest of
the hon. Samari tans were willing to work for them
as they now do for the glorification of a company
of sticks —or “sticks” mostly. Take the case
of the Maddens the other day. Their influence
and push accomplished two splendid audiences at
Melb. Alexandra. A fairly good programme
would have ensured a liberal attendance of out-
siders and assisted the “cause” even further.
But it wouldn’t have gratified the desire of a few
awkward girls and weak-minded men to appear at
a real theatre before people who had really paid
for the infliction.
At Poverty Point.
Grace Noble goes to England at the conclusion of the
present B. and B. Melb. season. She is a pretty girl, and
would be a very good actress if she wouldn’t always talk
in the key of her top 0.
A Maoriland paper thus moralises; “I am reminded of
this by a story told me as having happened not a thou-
sand miles from Christchurch, where a great artiste
performed before a vast audience, and was afterwards
twitted that the performance lacked its usual fire. Few,
indeed, knew that the heart of the performer was swell-
ing almost to bursting owing to mental pain and anguish
at having been treated in a dastardly manner, and that
physical pain was added through an attempt to physically
incapacitate the victim of a scoundrel’s brutality.” This
is tantalising. Who was the great artiste, and who was
the scoundrel, and what had he been doing to her .
Guess 1
Yet one more from the great family. Will Simonsen is
now a professional tenor, like Jules. But the boys are
not equal to the girls.
“ Histrion ” furnishes Tub Bulletin with a list of
actresses who are managers’ wives, but we are not sure it
is accurate—or advisable.
Effigies of Mrs. Needle have been withdrawn, by order,
from the two Waxworks shows in Melb. They were not
very libellous effigies, the lady wearing an expression of
abnormal guilelessness.
Majeroni, who gives a very creditable perform-
ance of George Barnwell at the Melbourne Royal, is only
17 years of age, and has been on the stage but 18 months.
Melb. advt.:—“ Evening with Dr. Bevan and Family,
Town Hall, Moonee Ponds, Tuesday next, Bth. Admis-
sion, silver coin.” New.
Giorza, of Menzies’ fame, conducts his own music at
the famous ‘‘Constantinople” show now running in
London. The ballet dances are all very catchy, and the
Signor, save for hair to his shoulders and a bit of extra
stoutness, is just the same old maestro.
Melbournian“ At * George Barnwell,’ the other night,
I saw the rowdiest house, all over, in my recollection.
Hope it did ’em good. Reminded me of the old-time
London executions. The last tableau is horrid. Maud
Williamson, in black, and Majeroni, in prison garb, stand-
ing on the gallows, with the ropes round their necks, and
the chaplain and executioner standing by. These per-
formers—i.e.. Miss Williamson and Majeroni, took a call
in a disgusted kind of way, but Coppin ought to insist
that they keep their ropes on, or otherwise half the
moral is lost.”
Several professional dramatic companies are playing
round Melb. suburbs, and are making bread and butter.
“ Admission, silver coin.”
Miss Helen Rowe, of Melbourne, writes a London cor-
respondent to Tub Bulletin, seems to be devoting herself
to private concert work. She recently sang at Devonshire
House before a select party of six or seven ladies, includ-
ing the Princess of Wales, and achieved a great success.
The Princess, after the performance, said to her that of
course what took place that evening would not be men-
tioned in the Press, but she was quite at liberty to
say that she (the Princess) was much charmed by her
singing. As the Princess is almost stone-deaf, this certifi-
cate may not carry much weight; but that is a mere
detail. However, the charming contralto is being taken
up by the “ nobs.” It is to be hoped it won’t turn her
head. One great bar to Miss Rowe’s success is her exces-
sive nervousness, which she cannot overcome in public.
0 Chief Justicess Madden might have engaged some out-
of-work actor or actress (there are plenty just now) to
"make-up” the society belles for her tableaux. There
they sat in rows, with cheeks like mammoth prize apples,
and with nets like bags of tow hiding their foreheads.
Spagnoletti: ‘‘l wrote of the boys and girls minstrel
company, ‘managed entirely by juveniles,’ which startled
my Melbourne suburb. These were the Juvenile Eagle
Minstrels. They have just come out with a fresh develop-
ment, in the Wellington Hall, Collingwood—a ‘Rational
Sunday Evening,’ as the bills term it, on the model of
Frank Clark, at the Alhambra, and Cogill Bros, it the
Bijou. Even agnostic parents like to send their children
to Sundav-school, just for the spirit of the thing ; but
what is the spirit of this thing? There are 24 boys and
girls on the bill, with a Sunday concert of nigger melodies
and slangy songs. It strikes me there must be some
speculator behind this 'entirely juvenile mangement ’
like the Padrones who exploit the Italian music boys.”
Rev. P. Mason, preaching about the stage in Melb., says
that what he objects to about the morality of the theatre
is that it is ‘‘ of a melodramatic order—morality striking
an attitude." If this had been said of Talmage and
M‘Neill, there might have been something in it. But
perhaps Mr. Mason does object to M‘Neill and Talmage.
A tale of the real Mdme. Sans-G6ne (Th6rfese Figueur)
She speaks herself: “1 had such a fright just now. I
fancied I had lost my big diamond. I left it in ray room.
1 came back and it was gone. They tell me no one has
been in my room but the/ro(feur (floor-polisher). I have
him in at once—a big blackamoor. He swears he has not
got it. How can I tell 7 A nigger can lie as he likes, but
you cannot see whether he blushes. I just shout out that
I mean to have it back. He turns his pockets inside out.
Then he shows me his hands. He sniggers and chuckles,
as he says, ‘Nothing anywhere, madame.’ Then said 1,
' I’ll soon see. Strip,’ I cried, * strip, you black beast, as
bare as God or the Devil made you. If you don’t I’ll have
you thrashed to death.’ Off came his clothes. I got
my diamond. Here it is. Your prim ladies of honour
would have lost the diamond. They are afraid of looking
at man in his natural state. lam not. I win.”
A correspondent writes to explain that that fetching
songstress, Miss Cecily Staunton, learned her art from her
husband, Herr Goldenstedt, with a few lessons from
Mndame Lucy Chambers, and that she was never, as
alleged, the pupil of Miss Annis Montague.
Maggie Moore will play a burlesque season about Cup
time in Melbourne.

Curios from N.S. Wales pension-list. In
1888, J. C. Read, Governor of Darlinghurst Gaol,
retired at the age of 68 upon an annual pension of
£372 4s. 5d., and his son, W. V. Read, Traffic
Manager for Railways, retired in ’9O at the age of
50 years, with an annual pension of £546 10s.
E. M. Young is in Melbourne. He used
to manage the National Bank, at £2OOO a year,
but returns as manager of a London company for
financing Australian squattages, at £7OOO a year.
Young is a financial genius who might be profit-
ably utilised to straiten up the public finances.
It is now generally understood in N.S.W.
legal circles that two Supreme Court Judges who
are suffering from chronic illness, will retire
upon pensions. Neither has yet served the full
allotted time (15 years), after which a Judge, in
the ordinary course of things, can claim pension.
Duncan Gillies’ trip ’Orae cost the Vic.
Treasury £250. So that Dunky lived at the rate
of about £5O a week. This is the frugal little
man who, on a historical occasion, gave Id. to a
Echuca “ boots.” By the way, a number of “ the
Firm’s ” imported ballet-girls travelled per same
mail.
The cook at the Hotel Australia, Sydney,
Is a mad wag. At the dinner to Premier Geo.
Houston Reid, he put on the bill, not as might
have been reasonably expected, “ Puddeney-pie k
la Georgey Porgey,” but “ k la Houston ”
indicative, The Bulletin presumes, of the stab-
ility of the new Ministry.
Mark Jeffrey, pugilist, burglar, convict,
murderer and author of “ A Burglar’s Confessions,”
died the other day in the Launceston (Tas.) Depot.
He was an eccentric individual and when not in
gaol spent most of his time in violently assaulting
his fellow man. He blamed his “ungovernable
temper ” for his various scrapes.
At Narrara (Brisbane Water, N.S.W.), of
which Kendall has so sweetly written, died on
Thursday last Mrs. Medhurst, at the age of 94
years. She was born in Sydney in the reign of
Captain Hunter, and before the century com-
menced, She was a great-great-grandmother, and
settled at Narrara 60 years ago.
N.S.W, Premier Reid was walking along
the street in front of a Bulletin man the other
day, and as he passed a newly-painted building he
touched it meditatively to see if it was dry. This
paper doesn’t hope for much from Reid after that.
It is only the weak and trivial man who is always
wanting to find out if the paint is dry.
The 16th anniversary of the death of Dr,
John Dunmore Lang occurred on 7th inst., the
opening day of the 16th Parliament of N.S.
Wales. At the Doctor’s funeral W. B. Dailey,
John Robertson, William Neill, and Henry Parkes
were pall bearers. Three of the four have fol-
lowed the valiant Doctor into shadowland.
Ernest Williams, third son of the Vic-
torian Judge, seems to have passed an exam, at
Sandhurst (Eng.) College, which will mean—The
Bulletin sadly supposes—an army-commission
for the young man. Hartley Williams, with his
knighthood and an epauletted offspring, is not
much like the once “democratic” Judge who rode
a bicycle.
Ashton, M.P. for Hay, N.S.W., is a push-
ing young man, who has progressed from a com-
positor’s frame to the editorship of his own news-
paper in Narrandera. As an orator he is aggra-
vatingly deliberate, and hangs so long on a word,
before adding the next, that his hearers have
time to go out and have a drink without losing
the thread of his argument.
J. A. Cook, secretary of Adelaide branch
of the shearers union, as a literary artist; —
I regret to say that 1 have seen professional vipers who
live on the fruit of other men’s labours—the coward who
sneaks in the dark, snaps a shed under any agreement at
any price. . . . Who is a scab that his feelings should
be considered ? Wherefore was he made ? He is not as
other men are. He is a cheat by profession, a blackmailer
by instinct, an alien to all high and manly attributes, an
outlaw even among the blackguards’ brigade that batten
on society. Thieves will not call him kin, honest men
shun him. ... A number of these vile creatures
passed through Adelaide en route for Wilgena from
Gee'ong and Warrnambool. The looks of the lot may be
summed up as follows :—Mouths that looked like a black-
guard’s benediction, their brows as narrow as a lawyer’s
conscience, bleared eyes are the windows out of which a
shrivelled and debauched soul peeps furtively. A dog
would not defile their graves, and the devil would not
foul Hades with souls so debauched.
HIS LINE OF DEMARCATION.
REV. FATHER DOOLAN (to whom Pat Murphy has just brought a load
of wood) : “Say whin, Patrick.”
P.M.: “Faith, th’ top’ll stop ye, yer riverence.”
Captain Standish, Yic. Chief of Police
before Cliomley, was at one time an ardent Roman
Catholic, and only relaxed in his devotions from
a feeling that they were incompatible with mem-
bership of the Melbourne Club. Of two evils he
chose the devil, but he never lost his love for
Mother Church, and, as the principal fast-days
came round, he used to send a sovereign by a
clerk in his office for bestowal in the collection-
plate.
When Shiels (Vic.) drew his funny picture
of Treas. Carter going to the tomb in which he
laid the Income-tax last year, and saying, “Like
Lazarus, come forth ” —Dan Lazarus, the new
member for Bendigo, was sitting opposite to him.
Lazarus is the best-dressed, and the most-dressed
—man in Vic. Parliament. Everybody looked
towards him when Shiels said this ; and for a few
minutes ha longed for the retirement of that
tomb.
The parson as a species is dull, dreary,
and humourless. A sense of humour, a perfect
gulch of smile, and a long nose like an ant-eater’s,
differentiate Talmage from his brother parsons,
and account for his phenomenal success. Who
has heard Talmage assert, with the solemnity of
an Elton, that the Prophet Jonah-in-whale’s-belly
story is true, without feeling inclined to poke the
waggish divine in the ribs and chirp, “Yah!
Murkan ! who are yer stuffin’?”
Alfred Bennett, of Sydney Evening
News, is said to bo a candidate for N.S.W. Leg.
Council. By the way. Proprietor Evans, of
Sydney Sunday Times, whose son was lately
appointed Inspector of Bores, reckoned on being
hoisted into the Council by Dibbs. He hired a
room overlooking the Evening News telegraph-
board on polling-night, and his manifestations of
anxiety as his own supposed chances went up and
down with the party numbers were most enter-
taining.
Henry Gyles Turner may be immortalised,
after all, by his connection with Victoria’s first
crematorium. As chairman of the St. Kilda
(Melb.) Cemetery Board of Trustees he is taking
measures to obtain a license for a bakery which
will eventually yield a revenue sufficient to “keep
up the cemetery” in elegant style after the ground
is full, and the old original business has ceased.
Turner will lay the foundation-stone of the crema-
torium, and a tablet will tell the tale to future
generations.
Fair Play : “A Bulletin writer is unjust
to M'Neill the preacher. Look at his giving up
the Regent Square congregation, the richest
Presbyterian one in London, or probably in the
world. Here he had notoriety enough, and was
deluged with money, being also enabled to live in
velvety ease, purple and fine linen, keep his
carriage, have his sermons largely devoured,
widely bought in expensive book form, and yet
he abandons all to tramp and rough it. The
Glory hypothesis won’t fit in.”
A comely Salvation Army lass encountered
Card. Moran while railway-travelling recently,
and with much confidence held up her end of a
modest theological controversy which accidentally
arose. On leaving, the Cardinal shook hands
with her and thanked her for the many edifying
remarks she had dropped, and received in recom-
pense the suave assurance; “Don’t mention it.
But, if at any time you feel in doubt or troubled
about your soul, be sure you call on me or send
me word. Where there’s a soul to be saved, there
is my place.”
Dear Bulletin, —The bogus jewels and
the tin swords and the fancy breechclouts are
half the soul of Freemasonry—as the other half
is the petty self-importance derived from a puerile
affectation of mystery. The Freemasons boast
the Brotherhood as more comprehensive than any
other ; well, it has only to become universal to go
“ bung,” because then one fellow wouldn’t have
the tin-pot satisfaction of knowing something the
other doesn’t, and which probably isn’t worth
knowing, anyhow. Sardonyx.
Should an income-tax

Miss Edith Walker, the

Jennie Lee has earned
the undying enmity of
financier Mark Moss. He
was at the Melb. theatrical
costume football-match and
called in at Jennie’s booth
for a whisky, tendering
half-a-sov. Jennie gave him
no change, only blew him a
kiss. He doesn’t think the
whisky was worth half-a-
sov,, and is sure the kiss
wasn’t worth nine-and-six.
Chief Justice Way, of
S.A., recognises that he
could have earned much
more at the Bar than he
receives {.£2000 a year) on
the Bench, but he confesses
that he made the exchange
with his eyes open, as he
was quite prepared to pay
liberally for the dignity and
the personal advertisement
of the position. “Who is
Way, Q. 0., compared to the
Chief Justice of S. A. ? ” he
asks, and endeavours, by
much puffing, to add that
“ cubit to his stature.” Re-
cently Nesbit, Q. 0., wrote
to a S. A. friend that he had
seen no Judge in England
who outshines Way in
respect to his manner or
his law; and the little
Chief, on being told this,
smiled complacently and
remarked: “I hope you
won’t think it conceit, but
I am quite conscious of
being able to hold my own
with any occupant of the
English Bench.”
Sydney University authorities expect that
the State subsidy, recently retrenched, will be
placed on its old la vish footing by the new Edu-
cation Minister.
The biggest oranges ever seen in Melbourne
are now on view. They are from Gin Gin, 50 miles

That story, apparently invented by the
Sydney Telegraph, that the Dibbs Ministry
tried to send Humphrey Oxenham to the N.S.W.
Upper House, was the first snag which Reid fell
over in his new capacity as Premier. At his
recent meeting he hooted at the departed Ministry
concerning its attempt to send a “two-to-one
bookmaker ” into the Council. Thereupon Dibbs
wrote to Reid asking the name of the alleged
bookmaker and further particulars about him, but
got no reply. Presently he wrote again, and this
time he instructed his messenger to roost like a
raven on a pallid bust outside Reid’s door till
the answer was forthcoming, and then Reid feebly
explained as usual that he had been wrongly
reported. What he said was simply that Dibbs
“ might ” nominate such a person. Dibbs ob-
viously scores over this little incident. The fact
that he “might” have done something which he
did not do is just as relevant as the fact that Reid
might have dragged Gov. Duff through the
Botanical Gardens by the hair, but didn’t.
The Chinese Mint does not assay its metal.
It just chances it.
Dear Bulletin —Cardinal Moran says the
Crank-of-Orleans “saved Catholic France.” Well,
if she did, it was equally Catholic England—only,
“ such trifles stick not in a churchman’s memory ! ”
Also, it was to Catholic England that the head of
Catholic Church gaily handed over the Cardinals’
bleeding country. “And that’s the humour of
it! ’
Dear Bulletin —“Ung” is ung-racious !
I have “managed” to look at the skeleton of a
horse (Sydney Musenm) and I find that the spine,
instead of being continuously arched, like the
camel’s, is curved downwards in front—which
makes all the differences ! Besides, it’s not my
fault that my assertion of what I have seen a camel
do doesn’t square with “ Ung’s ” theory of what
he oughtn't to be able to do !— Dromedary,

EVANGELIST M‘NEILL.
S.A. Legislature ought to abolish capital
punishment, for though there has been no execu-
tion in the province for 20 years the murder-rate
compares most favourably with that of the rest of
Australia. The latest capital conviction is that
of William Brown, formerly a soldier in India,
who slew his mate, Geo. Marosky, a Pole. The
two were camped on a station near Waukaringa
(S.A.), where they were prospecting, and without
the slightest apparent motive, save greed, Allen
shot the Pole through the head. Within a fort-
night Allen had sold all deceased’s effects, and
was caught just before finally flitting from S.A.
Allen has seen much army service, and when in
drink is supposed to be a madman, owing to the
effects of a sabre-cut on the skull. This latter
circumstance may afford a reason for sparing his
miserable life.
Editor Bulletin, —About two months ago
a man named Brumey Clarke was killed here by
two niggers. Said nigs, then cleared into the
ranges with horses, etc. The police asked a
doctor to go out and post-mortem Clarke’s body,
but doc. wanted ,£25 for the work, and the police
offered only lOd. a mile out (£57 10s). The doctor
would not accept, so a police-officer went to the
boiling-down establishment and had a tin can
made, and, in company with two troopers, started
to the place where Clarke had been murdered and
buried. On arrival they dug the body up, cut
the head off, put it into the tin can, and returned
with it to Burketown, where they are going to
hold an inquest on the head. The niggers first
split Clarke’s forehead open with a tomahawk,
and then put a bullet into each temple; the rest
of the body was in no way bruised, and showed no
sign of violence. We aren’t yet quite civilised up
here. —H.H.B. Burketown, N.Q., July 23, 1894
Neuralgia.
Is the first, surest and most reliable sign of nerve
decay; it is a symptom provided by nature to
warn the sufferer of approaching weakness and
distress, though in moat cases the pain is purely
local; the disease is constitutional and local
remedies, such as liniments, oils and menthols, only
give temporary relief and do not do the slightest
permanent good, for they only act by deadening
the sensibility of the affected nerve. The remedy
to be of any lasting benefit must be tissue forming
and nerve strengthening and must have general
invigorating properties ; it must also contain the
material to restore the lost tissue to the impover-
ished nerves, and no remedy except Clements Tonic
possesses these wonderful powers. Clements
Tonic has been used for thousands of cases by
young and old of both sexes for neuralgia, sciatica,
and other nervous complaints, and we have never
heard of a case where it has failed to give quick
and prompt relief. Read of the case of Mrs. T.
Watts, Woonona, N.S.W., who writes on March
23rd, 1893 : —I have suffered severely from indi-
gestion for the last three or four years, I was
unable to sleep, and had a continual languid feel-
ing, loss of appetite, severe pains in the chest and
stomach, and was half of my time unable to per-
form my household duties with any degree of
pleasure. I had the advice and medicine of
several doctors, but without receiving any benefit.
Hearing Clements Tonic so highly spoken of for
the above complaint, I resolved to give it a trial.
I felt myself improving from the very first dose,
and am happy to say before I had finished the
first bottle all disagreeable symptoms had dis-
appeared, and I felt better than I had done for
years ; I have never had a return of the old com-
plaint since. I recommend it on all occasions.—
I remain, yours gratefully, Mrs. T. Watts.

WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOUR BLOOD?
YOU ARE NOT HEALTHY.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
YOU FEEL RUN DOWN. . ,
WHAT IS THE REASON ?
IT IS YOUR BLOOD
OUT OF ORDER.
WHAT MAKES BAD BLOOD?
DISEASED KIDNEYS.
WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?
CURE YOUR KIDNEYS.
There never has been but one reliable, one
standard, one certain cure for diseased kidneys
and impure blood, and that is, Warner’s Safe
Cure. This truth is acknowledged by the best
doctors, the most renowned scientific men and the
highest authorities in the world. Throughout all
Europe, in every part of America, and even in
Australia and other distant lands, it is admitted
to be the standard, the only remedy for men and
women whose blood has become deranged, for men
who are unaccountably debilitated, and for
women whose lives do not pursue their normal
course. These are admitted truths, which you
doubtless know, and we trust, in reminding you
of them, we are doing you a favour.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The B A. National Ass party is actually
canvassing S. A. with petitions against free educa-
te present N.S.W. Legislative Assembly
has six barristers less on its benches than the pre-
ceding one.
Writing to a Bulletin man, a Canadian
correspondent sums up the Ottawa Conference in
one word ‘ Wind !
Premier Reid : “ Our financial year starts
at the wrong time.” Not so. The wrong time
starts at the financial year.
Wm Strawbridge, the new S. A. Surveyor-
Oeneral, will get .£BOO a year. His predecessor,
G W Goyder, C.M.G., drew £1450.
Reid’s action in calling a meeting of his
nartv before forming a Ministry looks like a step
towards the House-elected Cabinet system.
A. K.O.M.G. -ship is not a political mas-
Where is Dibbs, where is Parkes, and
where will J. B. Patterson and MTlwraith be
shortly ?
Parkes’ friends and enemies should look
up the allusions to Federation made by him m a
speech down South when Melbourne Exhibition
was opened.
The Wentworth (N.S.W.) electorate, re-
nresented by J. P, Abbott, contains 32,000 square
miles. Scotland contains 29,820 sq. m., and
Ireland 32,530. , , ,
Of the 25 Freetraders, members of last
NSW Parliament, who picnio’d G. H. Reid a
few months ago, only 14 have found their way to
the new Assembly.
The doom of N.S.W. Premier Reid : I
am determined that every week in the public press
of this country you shall know as much as i do.
Alas, then, for N.S.W. 1
Drake, M.P., Queensland ; “ Could Dibbs
and Parkes coalesce ? The idea may seem absurd ;
but since the Griffith-MTlwraith coalition every-
thing seems to be possible.”
The English Ministry will next session
submit a Payment of Members Bill. To Tories of
the old school this means that the end ot tbe
world will come next session.
NSW. Premier Reid celebrates his
accession to office by interchanging Billingsgate
with ex-Premier Dibbs. Apparently Dibbs mind
is Reid’s size, and Reid’s mind is his own size.
Grafton (N.S.W.) Mercury The
interest taken in the general election by women
in some instances was so keen, that they hid their
husbands’ electors’ rights when political opinions

According to the rules of donkey-racing
Foran was the winner at the recent re-election for

having scored six votes, the exact number of his

For the last ten years Q. expenditure per
head of population has never failed to exceed
revenue. Last year shows the nearest balance for
a long time—revenue per head, .£7 14s. Bd. ; ex-
penditure, £7 15s,
The average daily traffic on Bowen (Q.)
railway is a woman and a bag of potatoes; men
and boys walk. Working expenses last year,
,£2300 ; total receipts, -£451. And interest on
cost to pay as well!
The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners, who
complain that the trains don’t pay, allow sailors
from the Imperial ships to travel in batches to the
lifle-range free of charge. N.S.W. men, being
“ colonials,” have to pay full fares.
A sign of the times is that the Agb is
printing letters signed “Democrat,” and so on,
calling upon the people of Victoria to_ arise and
implore its junior counsel, Alfred Deakm, to come
forward and save his bleeding country.
Yic. Treasurer Carter fell ill of a severe
attack of blue funk after delivering his Budget
speech, and is not expected to recover for several
weeks. He is in his doctor’s hands. that
apothecary may cure the man, but the Treasurer
is incurable.
David Storey, M.L.A., sums up N.S.W.,
Premier Reid’s policy as an amalgam of conserva-
tive, radical and liberal elements, and pro-
mises loyal support provided a due proportion
be observed in legislating along each line. That
is just the saddleback of the ridge Reid is
climbing.
The proposal to raise salaries (Civil Service,
Q.) under £l5O by £lO or £2O, and to tax salaries
over £l5O by a graduated scale, is about the first
sensible step taken by the presen t_ Ministry, Had
it been done last year, the Ministry might have
won a few more votes at Ipswich and Townsville,
both Civil Service strongholds.
Parkes says Premier Reid is a bitter oppo-
nent of Australian Federation, and is out of touch
with the people on measures of urgent social
reform —such as the regulation of the drink-traffic,
for example. “ Urgent social reform ” is good.
Parkes has had the Knapps and other old ladies
on the teetotal string for 30 solid years.
Taking life-averages and political pro-
babilities, J. P. Abbott bids fair to break the
record as N.S.W. Speaker. This Parliament
which, even though there be a change of Govern-
ment, is likely to last out its term, will give him
six years’ currency, thus beating Daniel Cooper,
and coming within a year of Wigram Allen.
Poor little Melbourne Punch should re-
print its cartoons of a few months ago, in which
Patterson used to figure as Hercules choking the
deficit, or a heroic blacksmith straightening the
finances, and so forth. Patterson has proved a
painful subject for the creatures that crawled to
him and invented his precious “ backbone.”
J. Brown-Patterson is said to have pri-
vately spoken of the probability of his final retire-
ment from political life when the present Vic.
Parliament expires. Having been Premier and
obtained a K.C.M.G.-ship, he has reached the
height of his ambition, and does not wish to chance
the ignominy of defeat at Castlemaine next
election.
Bishop Webber (Q.) actually twits J. Bull
with shooting his pauper rubbish into Australia.
Thus: —“You have sent out your unpropertied
emigrants for a quarter of a century to shores,”
etc., etc. To do Mr. Webber justice, he sym-
pathises not with the unpropeitied emigrant, but
with the unpropertied parson who comes out to
live on him.
Glassey has introduced in Q. Parliament a
One-man-one-vote Bill which hasn’t the slightest
chance of passing, as it is only the plural vote
which keeps Boodlewraith in power. Anyhow,
the measure is complicated with weak points, and
singularly omits to provide one of the most vital
points of all—the redistribution of constituencies
as single equal electorates.
Rumoured that when Wilson (Q.) resigns
his post as Minister for Education, the amiable
and polished John Thomas Anuear, of Mary-
borough, will be offered the position. Of whom it
is recorded that as Chairman of Committees he
was accustomed to stertorously ejaculate ; “ Them
as is in favour of this ’ere motion say ‘Hi.’
Them as is agin it say ‘ No.’ ”
As the Women’s Suf-
frage Bill involves an altera-
tion of the Constitution, its
second and third readings
have to pass by an abso-
lute majority of the S. A.
Council. The numbers are
so close that the division on
the measure has been held
over for weeks because of
Labour - member Guthrie’s
absence through illness.
That peculiar species of
gibberish aphasia, with which
M.’sL. A. are afflicted, came
out strongly during the de-
bate in the Vic. Legislature
on the Woman’s Suffrage
Bill. £ £ Smith lamented
about the horrible scenes
which might arise in the
refreshment-room under cer-
tain circumstances nob
stated. Staughton wanted to
know if a lady mayor should
be her own ohucker-out.
Another M.L.A. told a weird
tale about a Chinese fight in
the bygone days at Clunes,
Frank Madden thought that
if a woman differed from her
husband in politics she would
probably throw the dishes at
him. M'Lellan rose to state
that the country was
“blighted.” Murray was
of opinion that the Catholic
Church was making insidi-
ous encroachments on the
freedom of the country ; and
levers got up and stated that
when he was in Europe he
had seen women carrying
coal up six flights of stairs.
Then the collective wisdom
of the country adjourned
and went home.
Brother Madden, M.P. for Wimmera,
Vic., says the farmers lose 13s. 4d. in the £ because
they sell three bags of wheat for a sov. now, in-
stead of one bag for the same money as heretofore.
The farmers do not sell at a loss now— ergo, they
used to make over 200 per cent, profit. Which is
absurd. Brother Madden said nothing of reduced
wages and cost of production.
Australia annually imports 80,0001bs.
opium, and as the duty under the various Govern-
ments ranges from 20s. to 40s. per lb., the revenue
thus derived is not to be despised. When the
liquor question is disposed of, however, the
crime of indulging in opium will be no doubt
whipped into public attention and a conscience on
the subject be rankly cultivated.
Bart. O’Loghlen told Vic. Assembly that
his “hair stood on end,’’ when he became a member
of the Patterson Ministry, and saw the state of
the Treasury. As O’Loghlen is egg-bald, members
yelled at the announcement; but the statement,
made in an unguarded moment, went to show
something of the real truth about the internal
rottenness to which booming and jobbery have
brought Victoria.
Deakin is blamed for his lack of patriotism
in neglecting to undertake the conduct of Victoria
in her hour of need. Everybody is heartily sick
of Patterson, Shiels is supposed to be impossible.
Berry is extinct, and Deakin is the only hope of
the non-Tory party; but he can t afford to come
to the rescue of his suffering country till he has
divested himself of heavy boom obligations, which
he is fighting pluckily to do.
Overheard at a late King (Sydney) election
meeting, “Mudgee ain’t what he used to be.
“No Bill, ’tisn’t that. You see, whin he wor at
the game before, he’d the field all to hims /lf as boy
politician. Well, he’s getting up in years now,
and, besides since members got a screw, and Henry
George kem out here, and this here Labour 1 arty,
there’s hundreds of young fellers turns their
attention to the job. There’s lots of cheap books
they can copy their lingo from, so they gi vs us
more book laming and less rough stingo. Mudgee s
dun.”
The call of yet another Judge’s son to the
N.S.W. Bar reminds one of fact that in Victoria
during the last 30 years but two Judges have had

Carter’s abandoned Budget was guilty of
double-truckling to the Melb. Gas Co. crowd. It
proposed to put sixpence a gallon duty on kero-
sene, and remit the 35 per cent, duty on Hinglish
gas-meters. The last proposal (which may yet be
carried) means robbing Victoria to feed the com-
pany’s dividend, inasmuch as there is no possi-
bility of the amount saved being devoted towards
a reduction in the price of gas.

The Victorian Parliament is far too
decorous. It does not represent the torn and dis-
tracted country. The very passions of the time
should find their vent in it. Otherwise there is
danger. The country will shape out for itself
something else if the Parliament be a smug,
ploughed and harrowed field of respectability.
Delegation is the word nowadays. A popular
Assembly must be an absolute mirror.
The difficulties attending Bible-reading in
State schools are exemplified by an item from an
article on English board schools and dogma in the
latest Nineteenth Century. One official com-
plained that he found the scholars impressed with
the belief that Joseph was the father of Christ,
and professed to be shocked by the heretical idea.
He has been asked to show how he would set the
youngsters right, and is now struggling with the
problem.
A GREAT STAGEMANAGER.
(Chief Justice Madden directing a tableaux rehearsal at
Melbourne Alexandra.)
There were 28 Roman Catholics in last
N.S.W. Assembly. In the present Assembly
there are but seven, and none in the Ministry.
Strategically, Premier Reid has been foolish in
this matter. He should have harnessed up a good
Holy Roman in the same team with a howling
Orangeman, after the fashion of his predecessors.
It must be conceded, however, that there is not
one pronounced “ sectarian ” in the Reid Ministry.
Dear Bulletin, —Glassey was elected as
leader of Q. Labour-party unanimously and not
by a majority. There was no other nomination,
and the A.L.F. did nob interfere by nominating
Mat. Reid or anyone else. Mat. is secretary and
whip of the party, and a better one would take
some hunting for. The Q. Labour-party is solid
as ever, and it will take a bigger question than
the choice of a leader to cause a split in it.—
W.H.B.
There was another temporary misunder-
standing in Vic. Assembly the other night, when
the artful Shiels described Mr. Bryan O Loghlen
as the “guerilla of the House.” Bryan had begun
to beat his stummick after the style of the hairy
man of the woods, and his friends were yelling
“ Withdraw !” before Shiels could explain that he
didn’t say “gorilla.” It was a mild repetition of
the “cowered ” “coward” incident which
brought the quivering Patterson to his feet last
session.
Thus Pall Mall Gazette “If such
reciprocity continue, we may yet see a Canadian
regiment mounting Queen’s guard at Buckingham
Palace, and an Australian officer flying his flag
as Port-Admiral at Sheerness.” And (let it be
added) that a spindle-shanked Hindoo may yet
be appointed Governor of the North Australian
colony of Piebald, and a British subject from
Hongkong be nominated generalissimo of the
Australian forces.
The Bulletin is requested to contradict
the statement that on the night of the banquet to
Premier Reid, B. R. Wise was sitting with
Parkes reciting to him Kendall’s sonnet com-
mencing :
I cannot tell what change hath come to you
To vex your splendid hair. I only know
One srrief; the passion left betwixt n. two
Like some forsaken watchfire, burneth low.
’Tis sad to turn and find it dying so,
Without a hope of resurrection.
Vic. Public Works Department has in-
serted some very arbitrary clauses in its conditions
of contract. In future, disputes of every sort ara
to be decided by the Inspector-General, whose
decision is to be absolutely final. Arbitration
has been abolished, and no responsibility is in-
curred by Government for discrepancies between
drawings and specifications. It, of course, re-
main's to be seen how some of these innovations
will stand in a court of law. So far, the only
'result has been an increase of 10 per cent, on
ordinary contract prices.
Somebody has counted up the attendances
of Gillies, the independent Maitland M.P., at
N.S.W. Assembly last session, and having divided
them into his “honorarium,” finds that he drew
£6 ss. for every night he visited the House, and
argues from this that “a monstrous price” is
paid for legislative work. As to the monstrous
price, what about counsel’s-fees and the fees
of several other professions? Is not legislation
as important as any of them ? And mayn t a
member be working harder for Ins constituency
and the country while absent from the House
than while in it?
N.S.W. teetotallers count upon five mem-
bers of the Reid Cabinet going with them against
compensation, if a vote on the subject cun e
reached in the present House. Reid himself, who is
almost a non-drinker, favours compensation,
opposes local option, is a straight-out enemy of
prohibition, and denies that Parliament has the
right to interfere with what a man eats or drinks,
so long as ho does not trespass on the/ rights of his
neighbour. More unlikely things have happened
than that Parkes will goad on the teetotallers to
disrupt the Ministry on this question and will so
make for himself his via ad astra.
A. G-. Taylor is the last man in N.S.W.
who ought to talk about sectarianism in politics.
While he represented Mudgee he always had the
support of the Orange vote guided by His
Majesty King Dan Cassin. A. G. made a big
mistake when he said G. H. Reid had _ had
“magnificent chances,” and “was born with a
silver spoon in his mouth,” while he himself had
had to fight for every privilege he had enjoyed.
No man in N.S. or Australia has had more
faithful friends or more devoted supporters than
the brilliant A. G., and if he was not born with
a silver spoon in his mouth, the spoon was put
there, and only needed care to keep it.
Treasurer Ward has rushed a Bill through
Maoriland Parliament, giving Government
authority to collect in August the Land-tax
usually payable in December, money being
urgently wanted to pay the half-year’s interest on
the Public Debt. This, taken in conjunction
with Ward’s boom budget, intensifies the horrid
suspicion that something is wrong with the
Seddon Government. Seddon’s backbone, like
the oppressive spine of J. B. Patterson, obtrudes
itself at the wrong time, and his stern refusals to
give information, just when he ought to be candid,
helps to intensify the feeling. A big majority is
fast spoiling Premier Dick Seddon.
S.M. Herald :
We have been decided and emphatic in vindicating for
Mr. Reid the position of leader of the Freetrade party,
and the responsibility of forming a Ministry to give effect
to the mandate of the country so clearly expressed at the
general election.
Which, of course, is all pure cheek and gall. The
S.M. Herald “barracked” and intrigued for
Parkes, and printed, as long as it dared, sneaking
little feelers inciting the N.S.W. Freetraders t>.
throw Reid over, When the game was up, and
Reid and the Daily Telegraph had finally pre-
vailed, the Herald has the impudence to declare
that it has been “decided and emphatic. ’ Qut
s’excuse, &c. The Herald was never decided and
emphatic in all its life.
Westralian Assembly Ministerialists nuni"
her 19 ; Opposition, 13—the •• ame proportion as in
last Parliament. But the Opposition is on’y
nominally antagonistic, a leaderless and incoherent
concourse of atoms ; and, thanks to tin po icy of
sop, the Forrest crowd is even stronger than
before. Moran, the independent Labour-member
for Yilgarn (Coolgardie), formerly a teacher in the
R.O. school at Toowoomba, Q., will have much
to do to make up for the loss of De Hamel, leader
of the old Opposition, to whom the highest com-
pliment that can be paid is to say that the
Westralian Tory ring hates him more than any
other man in the country, and that he deserves it.
Altogether there are only 6 new representatives in
the Assembly ; but the new elective Council, with
21 members, contains only 5 of the old nominees,
and the remarkable unanimity with which these
fossils went down wherever they put up is, from a
democratic point of view, the most cheerful thing
about the recent rattling of dry bones.

Mrs. Mount Morgan D’Arcy gave the ball
of the season at the Savoy last week (writes Thk
Bulletin’s London correspondent). Such a
galaxy of “ real swells” has rarely assembled even
in the very best houses. They were not the
ordinary “guinea-pig” order of aristocracy, but
the veritable crime de la crime , including the
Westminsters, Radziwills, Stanhopes, Derbys,
Atholes, Ilchesters, and scores of others. The
D’Arcy’s social greatness is due, in a measure, to
the fact that with all his coin D’Arcy does not put
on any “side.” By the way, they say there is a
religious hitch in the reported Marlborough-
D’Arcy alliance.

Premier Kingston (S.A.), ever since he
has been in office, has been scrupulously careful t°
invite his personal enemy, President Baker, of
S.A. Legislative Council, to all official gatherings
under Government auspices, so that Mr. Baker’s
bad form in shutting him out from the list of
invited guests to the Presidential annual dinner is
the less excusable. In any case, Kingston would
not have gone, so that Baker miuht have safely
concealed the unpolitic evidences of his malice.
Owing to the slight put upon Premier
Kingston, Speaker Coles, instead of feasting at the
presidential dinner, spent the night with two of
his numerous family at Fill is’ circus. Baker is
now believed to deeply regret his latest attempt
to get even on Kingston, for his dinner was a
ghastly failure. Though there were 13 outsiders
present the total company only numbered 30,
several members of the Council being absent.
Among these Chief Secretary Gordon, Labour-
members M‘Gregor and Guthrie, and Addison
made no secret of the fact that they stayed away
because Baker attempted to use his official posi-
tion to gratify his personal spite. The claim that
Baker invited his guests in a private capacity is
very thin. For he had the Parliamentary ban-
quet-hall, and the free use of the Parliamentary
waiters and servants, together with the run of the
official apartments,

From a private letter : —An illustration of
W.A. conservatism : A friend of mine, en route
to the goldfields, called in at an Albany barber’s
for a shave. As a victim was already being
operated upon, he sat down to await his turn.
Meanwhile, however, a third customer walked in
and took a seat. No. 1 being “finished,” my
friend is making for the chair, when he is stopped
by the barber with : “ Pardon me, sir, you are
not a resident.” Then the barber turned to the
new-comer with : “Now, Mr. Jones ! ”

body else. The entire creed of all

Dear Bulletin, —You mention
the sale of Sunday newspapers has
been prohibited in Canada, as it is
prohibited in Victoria and other
Australian states. You will not, I
am sure, sneer at the remark that
Canada, Victoria, &c., are un-Hing-
lish in their Sabbath legislation.
Isn’t it about time that “Greater
Britain” began to be more English
and less Scotch? Hinglish pre-
judices get rubbed off in Australia, I
fancy, whilst Scotch cant made
powerful by Scotch clannishness and
Caledonian “ blow ” societies—is cast-
ing a shadow over the land. “ Dear
old England ” has at least managed
to keep its Nonconformist canters in
check, which is more than Young
Australia promises to do. Shall I
tell you why Sunday newspapers are
published in N.S.W. ? Because
Parkes, your intermittent ruler for
go many years, wasn’t born North
of or near the Tweed. I think I have
said all this before. But, please, let
me roar it once again. Yours,
English.
The appointment of Arthur Gallon,
Governor Duff’s late Private Secretary, as N.S.W.
official historiographer, affords yet another proof
that your average Australian politician, whenever
he rubs shoulders with anybody even on the out-
skirts of “Swelldom,” becomes immediately
debauched. But for his gubernatorial connection
Gal ton would assuredly never have got the
appointment.

N.S.W. Chief Justice Barley announced,
in a recent divorce-case, that he will never again
accept the evidence of a private detective unless
it is corroborated. Quite right; but a private
detective is very often a retired official detective,
who while taking State pay, constantly accepted
private commissions, and whose evidence, before
his retirement, was taken over and over again
without corroboration. This fact, in the light of
Mr. Darley’s new dictum, is a solemn thing to
reflect upon. Also, if he is henceforth to be
believed only when supported by corroborative
evidence, the inevitable result will be that each
private “ D ” will keep his own corroborator on
the premises. Unless Mr. Darley keeps an eye
on the man who corroborates the detective things
won’t be much improved.

The Maoriland authorities have shut down
on the sale of a dreadful American paper—the one
which contains illustrations of the lovely young
woman in her night-dress pounding a burglar
with a poker, and the lovely young wife, generally
in her night-dress, being suspended by her hair
from the window by a brutal husband, and the
midnight marauder who gets in at the window
and scares a lovely young woman in her bed, and
the beautiful bride who is being gored by a cow,
and the like. Thereupon a Maoriland corres-
pondent wants to know why the same authorities
don’t shut down on the studies from the nude in
the Art Journal. Which only goes to show
that, despite free education, there are still people
in existence who don’t know the difference
between a work of art and a picture of a lady in
striped stockings and a night-dress being dragged
round by the hair on account of compromising
letters which have been discovered in her work-
box.

The Age for 23rd July presents the most
comprehensive picture of Melbourne’s present
wretchedness which has been seen up to date.
On the first page (and in the very first column in the
paper) there are about half-a-column of death
notices, crowded together in the smallest of type,
followed by over half-a-column of “In memoriam”
notices, also in the smallest of type, and aceom
panied by great masses of execrable “poetry.”
There is a “bereavement notice,” too; and the
very last item in the paper consists of three-
quarters of a column of funeral notices. But
there is not one birth or marriage announcement-
in the whole paper ! Apparently, people can’t
afford to be born in Melbourne now.

That excellent measure, “ The First
Offenders’ Probation Act,” has been greatly
abused in the North. The provisions are fre-
quently extended in directions the most astound-
ing. Surely it was not intended that such
offenders as civil servants of long standing and
handsome emoluments, whose defalcations extend
over a considerable time, should be classed as first
offenders ! Note the case of a certain Brisbane
embezzler, whose sentence of two years was re-
cently suspended under the above-mentkmed Act.
Sydney Municipal Council is thinking over
a new bye-law whereby any person spitting on
the city pavements will be liable to a fine of not
more than =6lO. If this by-law can be extended
a little, so as to cover the fiend who throws orange
and banana-peel on the footpath, and the bloke
who howls in the street, and various other coves,
The Bulletin will approve enthusiastically-
provided it is only enforced. The dismal circum-
stance is that no bye-law which will help to make
the city a little cleaner and more respectable
ever is enforced. One reason for this state of
things is that there are not one-half the neces-
sary police-force, and another is that what force
there is seems to be very tired. Also, the local
“copper” is always being sent out suddenly to
the far west to interfere in shearing strikes and
the like, and then the “push ” riots on Saturday
nights in the busiest thoroughfares, and it is only
after a free fight has lasted 30 minutes, or there-
abouts, that a lonesome officer named Gallagher
looms up on the far horizon.

the lion-enrager, assumed temporary command of
the unlucky waggon, and was horribly bitten by
the lions the third day after. He was followed as
driver by Frank Jones, the clown, who got a tele-
gram next day apprising him of the fact that his
wife had triplets. At this fresh calamity the firm
gave in, and bad the figure 3 painted out, since

While a train was recently running from

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHA.T IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad rMcle for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you? Will you do your business at

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and FLET-
CHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to cure the
worst cases. General debility, nervousness,
weakness, and general complaints of the digestive
and nervous systems are promptly cured by these
reliable remedies. They are prepared by scientific
processes, and are not merely mechanical mixtures
made only to “gull the public.” The renown
CLEMENTS TONIC and FLETCHER’S
PILLS have won in Australasia is proof of the
fact that they stand preeminent for their special
classes of diseases. No remedies ever sold gave
such entire satisfaction to their patrons, and
evidence is forthcoming from every city, town,
and village to prove their virtues. No doubt can
now exist as to their value, but purchasers must
be careful to get the genuine articles; as many
unscrupulous traders will attempt to palm off a
substitute, if possible, for the sake of extra profit.
How to Get a Piano or Organ.
YOU, of course, want the highest quality of tone, action,
touch and beauty of exterior you can afford; but
you must have durability. Durability is an indispensable
condition, and however cheap an instrument may appear,
without durability it is worthless. Avoid the cheap
pianos, for which there are agents in every town, who tell
—and often through ignorance believe—that they are
equal to the Steinway or the Erard or some other first-
class maker. Therefore, no matter how big a bargain you
think somebody else offers, investigate

That medical sensation in the Dutton
(Melb.) divorce-case recalls memories of a surprise
sprung upon a London jury some years ago. A
doating husband was driven to a divorce-suit by
his wife’s scandalous behaviour in visiting military
officers at their private quarters, where she com-
muned with them under the suspicious circum-
stance of a locked door. It transpired early in
the case that there had not been cohabitation
between the petitioner and respondent. The lady
didn’t become a wife in the marriage service sense
of the word, but the husband probably worshipped
her the more on that account. He never protested
against her plea of delicate health and natural
indisposition to worldly love, until she took to
visiting his male acquaintances as aforesaid. The
circumstantial evidence of “ misconduct ” was
strong enough to divorce any woman, but for the
defence there came a doctor who stated that the
giddy married lady was still—well, as all spinsters
are politely assumed to be. The Judge, however,
ruled that no medical evidence could prevail
against illicit love-making, secret visits, and
locked doors. The inviolate wife was ultimately
found guilty and sentenced to a decree nisi.

Premier Patterson says
that Australians are “ some-
what lacking in respect for the
dead,” Patterson, who will
be dead some day himself, is
rather hurt over this trait, and
thinks it ought to be remedied,
and he apparently doesn’t con-
sider that the community may
have lost the habit of respect-
ing the dead chiefly for want
of a suitable corpse to prac-
tise on. If the dead were
not respectable when they
were alive, they aren’t worth
respecting when they have
ceased to be alive; if Patterson wants them to
be respected simply because of their decease, he
is merely inculcating the great virtue of Rever-
ence for Decayed Meat. When a man has done
nothing great or good or noteworthy in his life,
it is impossible to respect him after death for any
other reasons save that he is defunct, and that he
would be a horrid-looking object to meet, and
this seems insufficient cause for reverence, Vic-
toria, for instance, doesn’t respect Patterson, and
has no reason to; and if it can’t respect him
because he is Patterson, it will be difficult to do
it later on merely because he used to be Pat-
terson, unless it respects him because he isn’t
Patterson any longer.

Dear Bulletin, —One cannot hurriedly
skim over Jones or Smith now when reading the
papers. Instead of Mr. T. Jonesor John Smythe,
one can always see something about Russell Jones,
T. Russell Jones, B. Russell Jones— in fact, every
Jones that is mentioned in the papers now is a
something Russell Jones. Even Barton has com-
menced to bo Russell Barton. Have you over met
Jones or Smith used as a Christian name ? How
would F. 0. Jones Russell look? Would a Par-
liament of Joneses b« a greater blot upon the
history of N.B.W. than a Parliament of aldermen?
Anyway, who ever heard of a Jones as doing any-
thing brainy ? Never vote for a man who admits
his name is Jones. The many varieties of Atkin-
son one reads of have also become harassing
lately. And what, in the name of plain English,
is Colonna-Close? Is it Hibernian for Jenkins?
We are simple people up here, and we like to be
posted in up-to-date nomenclature. —Yours, F.
(Wellington, N.S.W.).

A Geelong boarding-house keeper was the
quaintestinoidentintheDuttondivorce story. This
highly-respectable female objected, so she deposed,
to Dr. Dutton and his servant, Nellie, remaining
together in the dining-room through the small
hours of the blessed Sabbath morning. She told
him that the Day of Rest had commenced and he
ought to go to bed. Dutton said : “ You can go
to h—l to-night and to church to-morrow.” Sub-
sequently he loaded his pipe three times with the
avowed purpose of' smoking the landlady out, but
although the room got full of tobacco-fumes he
could not drive her forth. Then he blazed away
with bad language until she gave him best and
retreated to her virtuous couch.

THE PICNIC GIRL
Let us strike our lyre to a joyous tune,
For the pic-nic girl will be with ua soon,
With her waving fringe and her blouse well-filled
(For the pic-nic girl is of shapely build),
And a tinge of brown where the amorous sun
Has kissed her cheek so fair ;
But we’re not enraged—though he interfered
With our monopoly there.
With her vermeil lips and her teeth of pearl,
Neat, pretty and plump is the pic-nic girl.
Fast vanishes Pleasure when Summer flies ;
For we’re pessimists all under dull, grey skies.
But the world turns rosy and girls grow nice
When the Summer’s sun strikes the Winter's ice.
While the south winds bite and the south winds screech
We fervently pray with will
For the ecstacies of Mentone beach
Or £he transports of Box Hill
For there never was sweeter music played
Than the “No ! I won’t! ” of the pic-nic maid.
It’s sweet in the evening when round we whirl
With our arm encircling the pic-nic girl;
But our pulse gains pace when we see a chance
To slip unobserved from the mazy dance
And the chaperon’s Argus-eye evade
By a masterpiece of tact;
Then we open our arms to the pic-nic maid
In metaphor and fact.
For a cuddlesome creature from foe to curl
Is the fetching, enrapturing pic-nip girl.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Tommy Corrigan.—Died, Aug. 13, 1894.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
You talk of riders on the flat, of nerve and dash
and pace I
Not one in fifty has the nerve to ride a steeple-
chase.
It’s gay enough while horses pull and take their
fences strong,
To rush a flyer to the front and bring the field
along;
But what about the last half-mile, with horses
blown and beat —
When every jump means all you know to keep
him on his feet!
When any slip means sudden death —with wife
and child to keep,
It needs some pluck to draw the whip and flog
him at the leap.
But Corrigan would ride them out by danger un-
dismayed,
He never flinched from fence or wall, he never
was afraid.
With easy seat and nerve of steel, light hand and
cheery face,
He held the rushing horses back and made the
sluggards race,
He gave the shirkers extra heart, he steadied
down the rash,
He rode great, clumsy, boring brutes and chanced
the fatal smash,
He got the rushing Wymlet home that never
jumped at all,
But clambered over every fence and clouted every
wall;
But, ah ! you should have heard the cheers that
shook the members’ stand
Whenever Tommy Corrigan weighed-out to ride
Lone Hand!
They were, indeed, a splendid pair—the great up-
standing horse,
The garnest jockey on his back that ever faced a
course,
Though weight was big and pace was hot and
jumps were stiff and tall,
“You follow Tommy Corrigan” was passed to one
and all.
And every man in Ballarat raised all he could
command
To put on Tommy Corrigan when riding old
Lone Hand.
But now we’ll keep his memory green while horse-
men come and go,
We may not see his like again where silks and
satins glow ;
We’ll drink to him in silence, boys, he’s followed
down the track
Where many a good man went before, but never
one came back.
And let us hope in that far land, where shades of
brave men reign,
That gallant Tommy Corrigan will ride Lone
Hand again.*
B.
*NoTE.-The old tcrey died in Maoriland buta few weeks
before his erstwhile rider was killed.
Backers bad a great day of it at Rosehill on
Saturday, when no less than four favourites “got home.”
Mutiny made an easy win of the Hurdle Race, and to the
surprise of a good many, Phararnond was brought out for
the Rosehill August Handicap, and, backed down to 2 to 1,
won comfortably. The Juvenile Stakes, the first N.S.VV.
two-year-old race of the season, fell to Killiecrankie, a
colt by Lochiel from Constance, the placed youngsters
being Witchery, a filly by Splendor from The Witch ; and
Miss Nora, a young lady by Nordenfeldt from Lady Nora.
Hereward and Ballater started equal favourites for the
Welter Mile, but Mr. W. P. Crick scored a win with Sadur
who started at 10 to 1, at which figure it is said Sweet
William won £lOOO.

The Henley Regatta is nowin full swing, writes
The Bulletin’s correspondent by last mail. I was there
on the opening day and certainly found a great falling-off
both as regards attendance and sport. However, it has
been proved that the English amateur scullers, at all
events, can hold their own with the best of the Canadians.
Nothing could have been more decisive than the way in
which Vivian Nickalls beat Wright, the Toronto man,
and as for the American and Canadian champion Ryan,
Guy Nickalls simply rowed him stone blind. Both the
trans-Atlantio men row in characteristic style, like all the
professionals we have had from that side (except, of
course, the incomparable Hanlan—shall we ever look
upon his like again ?). They go off at a tremendous pace,
doing much unnecessary arm-work, and it is only a ques-
tion of keeping them ac it until they “crack,” which
they are bound to do. As for the “ Goblets," after the
way they were beaten in the Diamonds the Canadians,
about whom such wonders were predicted, refused to
throw down the gauntlet to the brothers Nickalls.
* * * *
Most of the English professional plungers have
come to grief lately, and settling is very shy, remarks
Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent. Tom Wilson’s
losses over Ascot ran into £30,000, and another heavy
bettor, who was warned off at the lime of the Charlie
Wood business, has dropped even more than that. Backers
must have lost a lot over Ladas in the Princess of Wales’
Stakes, won by Isinglass. The latter, though he went
dotty in his preliminary, and consequently receded to
100 to 12, carried a heap of money, principally from
Ireland, where anything trained or owned by Machell is
bound to be well supported. Paddy believes in the
“ Captin darlint.”

Three sportsmen were charged at Footscray
(Melb.) Court, the other day, with the crime of carrying
firearms on Sunday. They didn’t know’ they were living
in Scotland, and breaking the Sabbath by roaming round
the wilderness after small game, but the penalty in each
case was 40s. The chairman said there was no option for
the Bench ; the fine was iniquitous yet the Law couldn’t
help itself. The Law, however, merely smiles a superior
grin when its administrators curse it.

Ned Triokett, now a Customs officer at Moama,
N.S. W., lately addressed an evangelical meeting, and told
how the sporting people who fdted and worshipped him
in his championship days afterwards neglected him when
he was destitute in Sydney. The long and melancholy
Ned is now a brand saved from the burning.

Memmott, the Australian billiard champion,
has come back from London with an undoubtedly
improved “ game,” and rather highly-coloured accounts
of his doings. The awful licking that he got from Peel,
in particular, is explained by the fact that he was all
abroad ” for the first few months after landing in Eogland
-an excuse that would have covered the whole of
Roberts’ tour in Australia. At the present moment,
Memmott, by his own showing, is as good. as anybody
bar Roberts, because he held his own with them in short
Barnes Probably, Peel would still like to give him 7000
in 20 000, for all the money he could put up. However,
Memmott was a success in England and h,B later per-
formances there make him out to be a 20 per cent batter
flayer than the Memmott we knew last year. It seems
KS he has only returned with a view to going back
•■home” for good. He swears by “home” in general,
and thinks he will be able to knock out a good living as a
professional player and tutor of gilded London johnnies.
Memmott explains the defeat of Roberts by
’Murkaii Ives. The larger size of the balls used in their
cannon game allowed Ives to get them jammed without
HiffifMiltiV whereas the reports favoured an i npres
n that the Yankee had accomplished the pheno nenal
font of lamming a couple of 2J inch balls between the
elbows of an .frdinary-sized pocket. The Britisher was
flavine- a same that wasn t his own under the other
man ! s conditions, and might have fared better on a small
French table, with the English balls. Ives wouldn t meet
him at a real disadvantage in one particular.

The Derformance of Sharland, the English

English tracks are as true as a die an<^
Melb man liad to ride for ten hours of the time through
blinding rain, and all the time through a strong wind.
The scheme for limiting Melb. football dubs to
draw only on their own localities for players, which is
now be"ng considered by the V.F.A., ought, if earned to
burst up the Essendon supremacy, and do much good to
the eame in the way of checking professionalism. Out of
tiie 95 available players in the Essendon club, less than
half-a-dozen reside in that district, the remainder com Ing
from all over Melb., and two even travelling from Geelong
and two from Warrnambool (1) every Saturday. The
other clubs are nearly as had. As soon as a small ciud
has a chance of getting hold of a smart local youngster,
the Fatman Football Club steps in and tempts the youth,
either with gold or fame, to leave his home club and throw
in his lot with the crowd that earns the most gate-money

The one relaxation at the alleged football-match
Melb. v. Williamstown, the other day, was the enthusiasm
of a female barracker for the ’Town, who waited for

the ladv. who was old and wrinkled, went into hysterics
of delight and told her she would have h “ r n " a ' l !’

sign While he was returning after the int ® r ' al
delightful old thing called him a coorsid blaygaird, and a
small boy of her party foilowed up McNab and
which resulted in a smacked face for the little vermin.
The delighted onlookers waited in expectation of a big
row for a finish up, while all Ireland from Wilhmnstown
cursed, but four policemen were on guard when McNab
returned, and the row fizzled.

lished.”— S. A. Register, Adelaide.

important scientific authority in the world—viz.,

A few days ago bills permitting women to sit
in Maoriland Parliament and to hold public offices
were negatived by large majorities, without even
being paid the compliment of discussion. The
tendency to turn the questions into ridicule was
so strong that some newspapers think it went too
far. But the average man is so constituted that
he must either laugh or shudder at woman in
breeches: and perhaps it is better to laugh.

On a Clerical Clown.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lo, the meek Nazarene made merchandise !
Talmage, his hard face cleft in horrid chasm,
Shames the sweet Christ, and with ear-splitting
spasm
Shrieks Science is a pack of lies, lies, lies !
Soft! while the witlings whelm him with their
cries,
Let us slip out, shun bigotry’s miasm,
And seek the page where grins no vain phan-
tasm,
But Truth shines clear from Darwin’s steadfast
eyes.
So, in a circus, a poor daubed buffoon,
The ape predominant, coarse jest up-piled
Till shrinking Nature sickened in a swoon.
Sudden a saucy wind the tent beguiled
To flatter heaven-free ; O blessed boon!
Then I looked up, and saw the stars, and
smiled.

For one thing, Treasurer Carter’s 10 per

Some tall shearing scores are reported
from Peak Station (M.L.), where 24 men put
through 3925 sheep in 8 hours, just about 163
sheep per man. At Albury, last season, Mitchell
and Scott, the two crack shearers of N.S.W., met
in the same shed, and had a trial of strength. At
the end of the day (8 hours) Mitchell had done
237 and Scott 235 sheep.
The late owner of a Melbourne Cup-winner
is now dry-blowing at Ninety-Mile, Westralia,
but he is still cheerful and tells some good
stories. When his turf-luck turned he found him-
self, one day, with .£16,000 to pay and only
£lO 000 to pay it with. He ultimately had to
get the £6OOO from the Jews on executing in their
favour security over his 16 racehorses, it being
agreed that he should work them for a year on
account of the lenders, who contracted to pay all
training expenses; which deal resulted, at the
end of the year, in the £6OOO indebtedness being
wiped out and the children of Israel owing the
Gentile turfite some hundreds of pounds. I or, while
under the borrower’s control the horses prospered
not—the beggars simply wouldn’t win, and the
Chosen soon got very tired of their bargain.
They were eternally suggesting, without avail,
a compromise: “ Bay us de moniseh, they
would say, “Ant ve vill let you have de horses.
Ve don’t like dese live sdocks. Whats th ®
matter?” inquired the cheerful sport Have i
done anything wrong?” “Oh, no, but our ex-
berienoe mit life-sdocks is nod goot. Vor m-
stdance, ve vonce met a tamned scoundrel nut a
circus and ve lent him £6O for a month on de
securidy of a pyootiful tiger Veil, he didn t pay
de£lBoand ve foreclosed. Then the tamnsooundrel
brought us to de tiger and says he, ‘Now, yoost
youdakehimafay.’ Und den ve found ve had
made a taran fool of ourself. Ve had forgot to
take a mortgage on de cage, and so vecouldnt
touch de brute. The circus man vent afay and
made a fortune. Ve don’t like dose Uve-sdocks.
Everyone is surprised to see how well
ex-Premier Dibbs bears bis sudden reverse of
fortune. But yesterday he might have stood
against the world, and to-day he does stand
against it. There is not a feather ruffled in his
knightly coat; not the reflection of the shadow of
the likeness of the sign of the ghost of a droop to
be seen in his ex-Republioan crest. 1 hough a
shattered political world has fallen in fragments
around him, the ruins strike him fearless —as
Horace beautifully puts it. Would it be treason
to hint that what gives strength to his mind, elas-
ticity to his step, and colour to his complexion, is
M—rsh—ll’s T—n—c N—rv—ne ?
“ Tom Collins ” dives in again :—
Dear Bulletin, — I wish our stiff-necked brother, “ Titus
Salt,” would acknowledge himself among the prophets
at once. Instead of substituting emphasis for honesty in
the endeavour to prove points not worth proving. To
dip at random into his evidence: What, after all, is
gained by taking the pious and immortal bloke of
Elizabeth Villiers as a type of continence, and Marl-
borough, whose solitary virtue was fidelity to his wife, as
a type of lasciviousness? The whole battle-argument is
not worth one misrepresentation, and, in any case, the
private character of the man who Fitzgibbons a campaign
matters nothing except he be a Gustavus Adolphus or a
Cromwell, governing with his strong personality more
or less congenial food for powder, and thus creating a
moral esprit du corps. Or private character may matter,
in the other direction, when, through the libidinous dal-
liance of its leader, a fine army becomes disorganised and
finally goes to “unutterable smash” at Flodden. Still,
man doesn’t live by war alone, and immoral people have
many other ways of becoming extinct. One more military
illustration, however, may not be out of place: On the
eve of the projected assault on New Orleans (Jan. 8,
1815) Gen. Pemberton issued the countersign, “ Booty and
Beauty.” Two sergeants’ hooks taken by American scout*
made this sample of English wit known to Gen. Jackson,
and he, in turn, made it known to his men. Apart from
the relative “ moral tone ” of the two armies, here was a
definite issue of morality suddenly superimposed on the
national quarrel. Would this—did this —enhance Ameri-
can prowess, and thus interfere with the survival of the
other party? Our argument hinges largely on the
answer. “ X.S.” admits that his Janizaries are dead ; 1
want him to admit that they are deader than the average
departed. The Huguenots, &o., are not dead, and never
will be while human nature remains susceptible to
noble example. In other words, the former are a
failure, the latter a success. “T.S.” claims that no
son of the Bay State has equalled Juarez in
greatness. True; neither has any equalled Toussaint.
But the almost actionable dishonesty of T.S. suppresses
the fact —easily verified—that Juarez, being a full-blooded
Indian was no more a descendant of the Conquistadors
than of Parkes. And if Miguel Hidalgo and Porfirio
Diaz were better known they would, perhaps, be more
appreciated. The two other Mexican advantages may be
conceded—indeed, the “happiest" people I ever knew,
and those who “ had evolved the least corrupt system of
government,” were the blackfellows on the station
where I was born. How many dwts. of proof to the
ton will that sort of evidence go ?—and it is all much
alike. To conclude. If by reason of the various misfor-
tunes besetting concupiscence, the opposite quality has
tended to survival, we shall be able to notice through
irregular cycles of progress and reaction, a distinct ex-
tension of the latter principle. If, on the other hand,
lewdness—enjoying per se the line of least resistance—
overbears its penalties and runs abreast w ith its opposite
(which is the hypothesis of T.S.) we shall find the moral
tone ” of the world a fixed quantity, or merely fluctuat-
ing above and below a given average, l ow, has there,
or has there not, been a moral advance along the line oi
civilisation, say, since the Middle Ages or since classic
historians and poets innocently unveiled gambols that
seem queer to most of us now ? Or, if advance be still
imperceptible to the jaundiced eye, we can extend the
base of our parallax back to the inception of ethnic mytho-
logy— Hellenic, by preference—and mark the angle sub-
tended from a time when sexual morality was unborn.
Evolution only can account for the existence and develop-
ment of such a principle—and how is evolution accom-
plished if not by selection and survival ?

Dear Wild Cat, —You suppose that £55 of un-
authorised silver shillings, lately rescued in Melbourne,
were made in Germany. The assay of the coins shows
they were probably made from Mexican dollars, so the
odds are on the counterfeiter hailing from the east where
the Mexican dollars are current. The forgeries are not
good. The bust on the obverse is too like the Great
Original to be like the ideal head on the properer coin.
The lettering is clumsy and the diameter too big, so that
in a roll of good coins the counterfeit would be readily
detected by the touch.—Yours, Fldffj.

At Melb. Tram Co.’s meeting a 5 per cent,
div. was declared, absorbing £24,000 out of the
£42,056 available—of which £22,333 was brought for-
ward from last year. £18,056 was carried forward.
The directors (what humourists!) whined bitterly
about the competition of railways and cabs, but
congratulated the staff on taking their 45 per cent,
salary reductions lying down. They were especially
slobbersome over chairman Clapp. “If Mr. Clapp asked
for £3000,” said one director, “ the co. would have to
go down on its knees to him, lor it couldn’t get on with-
out him.” A shareholder inquired as to the rates of pay
among the tram-men, and was glibly informed that
“ Gripmen get 40s. arid conductors 38». a week. But the
second-class men get hardly as much." “Hardly as
much " means anything from 15s. to 255., while, as three-
quarters of the men are second-class, the chairman might
have truthfully observed—“ They get about 15s. a week,
but the first-class men get hardly as little.” Such are
the ways of the private corporation with a monopoly
secured by Act of Parliament.

A "Discount Coupon Trust” scheme is being
Introduced vigorously to the notice of Melbourne trades-
men. The Trust proposes to sell 50s. worth of coupons to
traders for £3; the traders issuing them to customers on
the form of, say, 2J per cent, bonuses on cash pur-
chases. A customer having acquired £l-worth of coupons
can obtain a guinea in exchange at the office of the Trust,
thus the shopkeeper is spared any troublesome financial
settlements in the matter. The scheme seems somewhat
fanciful, but it may attract women for that reason, and
the Trust, never holding much money in its possession,
would have no overpowering temptation to bolt. It is
said to work successfully in Manchester, where a lot of
cash trade has taken the place of long credit business.

The Hobart whaleship, Waterwitch, has just
completed her 15 months’ articles, during which time
she has secured 160 tuns of oil—all in the vicinity of the
S.W. coast of Tasmania. The largest whale yielded 11,
the smallest 7 tuns. The result of the voyage is con-
sidered splendid, as even in the best days 80 or 90 tuns
for 18 months’ articles filled the hearts of whalers with
jubilation. The new Hobart whaler, Helen, is frequently
sighted “ trying out," and should drop in at the Derwent
shortly a full ship.

A big racing-man and a pious friend of his have
quarrelled on the Stock Exchange over the North Duke
deal because, it is said, the latter got out between 30s.
and 355., and the wily owner of horses got left at 14s. to
15s. There is much lamenting in the ducal clique over
the alleged tergiversation of the collection-snatcher.

Treasurer Carter’s Budget speech contained the
threat that Victoria might insist on coining her own
shillings and sixpences. Empty as is the threat,
it contains a gleam of'sense, but the easy and accessible
manner of appropriating the advantages of domestic
currency by a State bank is burked by Carter, as by every
bolsterer of the Fat-man-bank. A State bank could issue-
half-sovereign, crown and half-crown notes, that would be
at once a public convenience and a State advantage.
With a group of provinces in the throes of
depression, and their a tendant Treasurers in the diffi-
culties of depression finance, it is wonderful that the
obvious idea of o.ie big Australasian State Bank has
never entered by chance into the aggregation of their
puzzledom. There might be cavilling at half-a-dozen
State Banks in Australia, but there is a large
certainty that a State Bank, backed up by the group,
would have no enemies but Fatman. It would have an
issue of State notes of several denominations that would be
current in every province. A trip across the provincial
boundaries would not discount such State notes, as
happens to the bank notes now. Such notes would mean
an assured and convenient currency to the public, and to
the bank a loan of at least £3,000,000 without interest.
The beauty of the thing is that there is no need to wait
on Federation and the log-rollers. The Australasian State
Bank will be a federation in itself.

London cablegram “ Mr. Herbert Arthur
Trower, of Throgmorton Avenue, City, formerly of Sydney,
was examined in Court yesterday. He stated that he
purchased the Wentworth Goldfield Estate, Lucknow,
N.S. Wales, for £60,000, and floated it in London for
£500,000. The public subscribed £32,000, The cost of
promoting the company was £20,000 in cash and 120,000
paid-up shares." Thb Bulletin hopes that there is some
mistake about these statements which, however, are not
surprising; for even more glaring transactions than that
imputed have been carried through in London. What
chance can Australian mining possibly have under such
circumstances ?

Dear Bulletin,—The Mt. Allen G.M. Co.
appears to be worked in a very peculiar fashion. Seem-
ingly, no effort is made to utilize the water in the main
shaft (now standing about 30ft. deep—it is stated that the
flow of water equals 800 gal. hourly.) Why is not adequate
pumping machinery erected and the shaft deepened to
the depth first decided on ? Again, is it a fact that the
poorest stuff is being crushed whenever the battery is
going, whilst there is any amount of loz. to IJoz. stone in
sight? The vulgar have a theory concerning these
things. Disgusted.

Dear Bulletin,-The warden at Clermont (Q.)
has a truly Solomonic fashion of doing justice. At Deep
Creek one party drove into another party’s ground and
took a load of dirt. A complaint was made, and the
warden came to investigate. Presently he came to the
party who claimed for the loss of the dirt, and said: “I’ve
settled the dispute. The trespassers say they are very
sorry and won’t do it again." “ But what about our load
of dirt—will they pay for it?—will they return it?” “I
can’t re-open the matter; the dispute is settled." And
off he goes.—Yours, Miner. And now for the other side
of the story 1

One Paul has jumped a hat-full of the best
Wyalong claims on the ground of non-compliance with
the regulation that holders must apply for survey within
three months of registration. The jump won’t pay any
dividend. Some of the richest scone yet found on the
field has been struck in Corry’s claim, though the reef, as
usual, is small. Meanwhile, the special Wyalong Provi-
dence is working 12-hour shifts, taking it in turns with
the ordinary artisan to sort out the petitions of the crowd
who want the Post-office at one end of the field from the
prayers of the rascals who want it at the other end.

Dunn, of Hillgrove—they now call him Mister

found other good mines in Westralia before making his
marvellous “punch,” the value of which latter he esti-
mates at about a million.

A Murchison correspondent to The Bulletin,
under date 20th July ; “ About 200 left the Murchison, a
lew weeks ago, for Lake Carey, far away to the south-east.
As none have returned, up to date, the inference is that
they are either doing well or have succumbed to want of
“tucker." Provisions must be terribly scarce, from all
accounts, but I understand that “ bungarrows’ ’’ and
lizards’ eggs are plentiful. On eastern goldfields, when a
miner sinks “ pot-holes ” all over his claim, it is described
as “pig-rooting." In W.A. it is spoken of as •• bungar-
rowing.” The “ bungarrow," or “ bung-eye,” is a species
of large “goanner," which burrows like a wombat. I
have seen him 6ft. long. Their bite is harmless, but
unpleasant.

Ooolgardie Mines, re the Londonderry jumping-
cases “The lying done was almost ghastly in its crude
enormity. If a building could blush, our Court-house
would be dyed crimson in utter contempt for the depravity
of some of the human race.”
• • • •
The agent for the Londonderry holders, against
whom an information for perjury was laid in re the
jumping-cases, testified that Mining Registrar Oakes pro-
mised him exemption on June 14, and produced a diary
in which the conversation was written down on that date.
Then the Registrar’s clerk went into the box, and swore
that he left the office June 11, and on June 13, at noon,
quitted Ooolgardie for England, via Perth. Awkward!
wasn’t it? However, the Bench decided that a mistake
had been made and dismissed the case.

Huxley, one of the Londonderry men, says that
the party which originally went to Westralia consisted of
twelve. At Ooolgardie they divided, the Londonderry
crowd making for Lake Carey, and the rest for the Mur-
chison. A month before the great find Huxley and his
mates, themselves stone-broke, got word from their Mur-
chison friends that they had met not a vestige of good
fortune and were shortly returning. Then the London-
derry was found. A while after the lucky diggers heard
that their friends had found a rich reef near the
Murchison. The finds were within three day* of each
other.
• * * •
“Rioh finds in Westralia” grows monotonous.
The whole province should be pegged out, taking the
solid gold for granted, and an urgent announcement sent
along when anybody strikes a barren patch.
The Londonderry has dropped out of the running
since lucky prospector Dunn found the Wealth of Nations!
Not a word this week of Big Ben and the marvellous
riches of the little old log cabin on the claim. The
owners, on dit, will stick to their ground and dolly out the
price of a A 1 crushing plant. Then the world may stand
back open-mouthed. That, anyhow, is the alleged pro-
gramme.
Dunn’s big find is “ about 15 miles N. W. of the
45-mile, ’’ which somewhat indefinite statement was yet
tufficiently precise to enable several hundred prospectors
o smell Dunn’s brother out as he sat watching the pile
by night. An effort was made to prevent them working
the ground up to 20ft. of the reef—which is customary,
but not necessarily lawful. But there are few things so
convincing as a mob of dry-blowers with a fine old prece-
dent behind them ; and Dunn and Co. judiciously caved.
Lots of rich Westralian leases have been so treated. The
writer knows of one lease off which quite 2000 oz. alluvial
was taken right under the nose of the lessee. The custom
is a good one, and prevents the country being “hogged ”
by men who happen to have enough money to shepherd
big areas.
The orthodox Westralian crowd have the laugh
of the t’other-siders this time, for the Dunn syndicate
includes the Premier Forrest’s inevitable little brother,
Ahck; also, the local Minister for Lands; and F. Monger,
M.L.A., and others.
Dunn says the reef, apparently a true fissure,
stands 3ft. above the surface, and is from sft. to 14ft.
wide. The syndicate lease is 38 acres, but Dunn pegged
out a 9a. for himself in addition, which is already sold
to an Adelaide syndicate. If the Wealth of Nation fails,
there is 2000 sq. miles gold-bearing country to fall back
upon.
Two of the unwelcome dry-blowers, who cleaiu d
out the ground near the’Wealth of Nations reef, picne l
up two specimens holding 2900 z. altogether. The .yu
dicate oan spare them.

“Dalziell’s telegram about six men getting
X000oz ; at some place south of Ooolgardie fell ver\ flat

solid reef will shift it. The Bulletin predicts.

A few of the really good di vidend-lookiny reefs
of the Ooolgardie field;—M'Auliffe’s reef and Meiklejohn’s
(White Feather), Hicks’ reef (Ninety Mile), New Victoria
and the Northern lease (near Mount Burgess), Golden Bar
and Maopherson’s (Ooolgardie), the Premier at the 26-
mile.
• • ♦ *
Some of the best mines of the Ooolgardie gold-
field the public hear the least about. Until it was bought
by Monger and Co., of York, Hicks’ of the Ninety-Mile
was comparatively unheard of. And very little would
have been had the owner continued in possession. Hicks
and his two boys have dollied out IOOOoz. from a shaft
80ft. deep, and an open cut 20ft. long by the side thereof.
There is over 3ft. solid stone, and even the impoverished
heap at grass will run 4oz. or soz. Hicks made his £4OOO
in six months by means of a hand-dolly, not by news-
paper paragraphs such as the public have had concerning
a lot of other local mines.
* • • *
Block 20, until it was floated and named the
Golden Bar, was unknown outside Ooolgardie, yet the
owners for 12 months have been raising 3oz. stone from a
shaft where the reef was from Bft. to 10ft thick. In the
immediate vicinity are many well-boomed mines of little
or no practical value.
* • • •
The Westralian Act provides for “continuous
working of leases hence under Warden Finnerty’s inter-
pretation- Mr. Finnerty is nothing if not literal—a lease
is forfeitable by reason of one day’s idleness, and if ons
day, why not one hour, or one minute ? The Act is an
absurdity.
• • • *
On many of the Ooolgardie mines more gold oan
be seen in the camp in 10 minutes than couldjbe got out
of the reef by dynamite in ten weeks.
* * • •
If true that the Londonderry marvellously rich
shoot underlies rapidly west, young Carter, one of the
original owners, who sold out of the parent mine for
£3OOO, has another big prospective show in his western
lease.
• • • •
A lot too much has been made of the value of
an enormous conglomerate deposit in the vicinity of
Marble Bar, Westralia. It outlived one or two con-
demnations by reason of the persistency with which it
was boomed by local hummers. At last it has been
effectually damned by a big mining man. If this does
not kill the mine someone should be hired to kill the men
who boom it. To go from Sydney to Marble Bar to see
a “ wild cat ” is a grim joke which costs hundreds of
pounds.
• ♦ * •
When the writer left Ooolgardie the Ninety
Mile was without even postal communication. It was
over a year old, supported a great number of miners,
teamsters, and others, yet every man had to travel Into
Ooolgardie to post a letter or make application for a
lease. In the latter case he had to choose between staying
there or making another trip to ascertain if any objection
had been lodged within SO days.
• * • *
On the road to the Ninety Mile you pass the
Twenty-five Mile (the locality of the Premier); Premier
Extended, Eureka, Golden Thistle, and other working
mines; the Forty-five Mile (the locality of Cashman
Carnage, and other mines). Yet all places, including
Siberia, had no postal communication. Sometimes chance
teams are availed of. but often letters have remained
three months at the Coolgardie post-office.
• • * *
There is a P.O. at Hannan’s hut, none at the
Four Mile, the Six Mile or Seven, at the Lake, the looali-
ties of the Ivanhoe, Great Boulder, Lake View, Crcesus
Star of the East, and many other mines. Every Saturday
afternoon hundreds of men walk many miles into
Hannan’s for letters and newspapers.

Concealment is the distinguishing characteristic
of Coolgardie gold-mining. Bayley concealed the Reward
find for five months. Not his fault it was not concealed
for a year. Londonderry ditto, and so it will continue as
long as the W.A. mining laws, which are the most defec-
tive and unworkable in the world, remain unaltered.
• * * •
The writer, who recently spent three months in
travelling over the Coolgardie goldfields, was never asked
for food or money, from the day he landed in W.A. to the
day he left. Within an hour of arriving in Melbourne hs
was asked several times. There is no starvation but many
hardships; more human and animal cruelty at Ooolgardie
than in any other part of the Southern hemisphere.
• • * *
If 6in. of rain should happen to fall at Oool-
gardie, in six days, or, better still, six hours, 10 per cent,
of wages-miners would not so remain. There would be a
general clearing-out to work alluvial. Many puddling-
machines, Chinese and other cradles, sluioe-boxes, and
every other means of water-treatment, are lying in wait.
* • • •
M'Auliffe’s, until floated, was one of the quiet
mines of White Feather. It is a big body of stone, 4ft. in
the bottom of a shaft 100 ft. deep; traceable for half-a-
mile, and containing a run of gold proved in M'Auliffe’s
lease a considerable distance; at grass, 800 tons, worth at
least 3oz.
* * • •
Under the practically unworkable mining regu-
lations of W. A., a miner’s right issued on one goldfield is
not applicable to another, unless it is endorsed by the
Warden. Ignorance of this anomaly will yet cause serious
trouble.
• * * *
The floated Coolgardie duffer is persistently
boomed, while the rich, privately-owned mine dollies out
gold in silence. Why don’t some of those boomed Cool-
gardie mines, of which the public hears periodically
“Another rich shoot of ore,” “Splendid specimens,”
&0., cart some of the rich ore to Southern Cross, where
there are several almost idle batteries? There are hun-
dreds of teams on the road, and they all go back empty
Back-loading can be got for £7 or £8 a ton. The cruel
truth is, they are not rich enough. Some day some of
the Coolgardie liars, In an unguarded moment, will speak
the truth, and the shook will kill them. Some consola-
tion in that.

Bendigo is anticipating a bad time —growing
tired of this monotony of ealls. The Vic. Govt, has been
approached. One proposal is to drive one or two cross*
cuts from one line of reef to the other to test the inter-
vening country. This is not generally approved because
of vested interests; the next and better idea is to see it
one or two of the well-known lines of reef could be ex-
tended as has already been done in several instances,
notably the Red, White and Blue. The work will pro-
bably be done by local co-operation and State aid.

annuity. The worse the life, the cheaper the annuity;
the better the life, the cheaper the insurance. Lots of
men who decline to pay a stiff loading would back their
lives for a cheap annuity; and the first 00. which adapts
itself to circumstances and drops cast-iron methods, has
every chance of a big profit, if its doctors know their

Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Burnet, Wallis & Co. report.—Wool’sales were held
this week, and prices all round were fully equal to last
quotations. A lew lots of Queensland wool were offered
which may be described as new clip, and passed into
buyers’ hands at prices which should prove satisfactory
to owners. In the Far West shearing operations seem to
be progressing without interruption, and the cry raised
by hungry agitators about a pending shearers’ strike has
ended in the proverbial smoke. The lapse of a few weeks
will see the new clip on the market and already a few
buyers have returned from abroad and are in full readiness
to operate as soon as the new clip is placed before them.
We cannot help again giving our opinion that owners who
sell in Sydney during the ensuing season will find values
■lightly above rates ruling last season, and we are certain
those who sold in London last year will greatly improve
their nett proceeds by selling in our local market this
time.
Sydney, August 11,1894.
Nbw Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., Ltd.,
report: Wool.—A buoyant tone has prevailed in the local
market during the past few weeks, and advices, per
mail, from the principal industrial centres ol Europe,
have also latterly been such as to afford promise of some
further improvement in wool vsiues in the near future.
That better prices than those current during the past
year may be forthcoming for the clip which is now
arriving is the earnest wish ol everybody in the trade,
and certainly with good, well-skirted and classed
Biverina wools, fetching only 7J per lb. in London,
as was the case at the July sales, equal to, say,
per lb. in Sydney, there is much room for an
upward movement. To what extent the tendency
towards greater firmness may be checked by the news
{ust to hand from the United States remains to be seen.
Jnfortunately this news is distinctly bad from the pro-
ducers’ point of view and would seem to indicate that the
Tariff Reform Bill, which lor many months past has been
under discussion in the United Slates Legislature, is
likely to be finally defeated, and this, too, after being
passed by both the Lower and Upper Houses. The Con-
ference Committee, to which the adjustment of certain
clauses of the measure was referred, could not agree on
some points in connection with the duties on sugar, and
it now appears uncertain what course will be adopted.
In Adelaide General Post Office last week,
at a busy time of the day, there was a rattling
stand-up fight between a lawyer and aM.P, The
latter was victorious after a lively skirmish. There
were 300 spectators.
The man-flayer at Darlinghurst prison had
another victim last week—a chronic lunatic—but
the _ daily press, which used to gloat over such
exhibitions, has carefully refrained from men-
tioning the scourging.
When Premier Reid was returned again
last week the announcement of the poll was re-
ceived with cheers. Reid made a speech, and was
greeted with cheers, and then he called for cheers
for Freetrade, which were given heartily. Next
he called for cheers for the returning officer and
his assistant, and they were also given ; and the
returning officer called for cheers for the Queen.
Finally Premier Reid drove away in a cab, and the
crowd gave cheers for the) cab, and three special
cheers for the horse, and one cheer thrown in for
the cabman. Then the meeting dispersed amid
oheers. By the way, the S.M. Herald has com-
menced the war against the new Premier by in-
sisting that he must proceed to take off the semi-
protective duties at ouoe.

It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest

distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and

restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

(With apologies to Mr. Percy F. S. Spence.)
Deep gorges upsending hob vapours to skies,
Emblazed with the sun’s scorching blood,
A stream-bed hard-crusted and wide-gaping lies
Athirst for the flush of the flood.
Rough ridges, half-crimsoned with splintering clay,
Trees smitten by swift glares of light ;
No sound but the hiss of the adder by day,
No cry but the curlew’s by night.
Parched plains out beyond where the yellow blades
crack,
By the bounds of the uttermost run—
A wayfarer sinks by the side of the track,
’Neath the stroke of the swords of the sun.
JULIAN SAKE.
In every criminal case heard at Darling-
hurst all witnesses are ordered out of court till
called onto give their evidence. Also, previous
convictions against a prisoner are concealed from
the jurymen who are tryinghim till they havefound
their verdict. But if the accused has to be tried
on two or three more charges the whole panel of
juries are allowed to remain in court and listen to
the first trial and see if he is convicted !
Gall and wormwood to the British must
be the recent decision of the Transvaal Govern-
ment, compelling British residents in the Republic
to serve in the militia, for the British developed
and made the country what it is to-day. Twenty-
five years ago the greenbacks issued by the Trans-
vaal authorities, with a face-value of <£l, were
selling at 2s. cash, and the province was going
downhill fast. Then came the clamour for British
rule, which, when attained, lasted for but five
years. And now to-day, only 13 years or so after
throwing off the British yoke, the Boers are boss-
ing their erstwhile masters with a high hand, and
the British lion refuses to roar. Gall!
“ Why,” asked an intelligent S.M. Herald
man lately, “ is the Herald called a Conservative
or religious organ ? Go over our file for the past
six months and you will find leaders advocating
or approving of smoking, drinking, card-playing,
horseracing, and betting. We urge the opening
of public-houses for at least a portion of Sunday,
and favour all decent forms of Sunday amusement
and entertainment. We support a land-tax, an
income tax, and payment of members. In our
reports of public speeches we are guided altogether
by the matter —its importance and usefulness to
the general public ; and who can say we have not
treated the Labour-party fairly? We oppose any
interference of the Churches with State functions.
Why are we called a Conservative or religious
organ ? ”
Thus a correspondent to a daily paper :
“On his release the convicted and sentenced first-
offender finds his one error has made him a
pariah. No matter how good his future life, there
is no chance for him. It is difficult for a felon to
obtain employment. A felon (at 18) cannot
become a member of Parliament at 50, even though
in the intervening years he has led an honour-
able life. A felon cannot even become a solicitor,
but a solicitor may misappropriate his clients’
money, and is suspended until he pays it back,
when he is allowed again to practise, and having
made restitution, the world (as it should do)
forgets. So long as a man’s first offence shall
make him a lawful outcast for life, we must
expect to breed criminals.”
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

Gov. McGregor is again to the front with
a report on advancement in New Guinea. Firstly,
the Governor rejoices over the progress made by
Christian missionaries in Papua. Secondly, he
draws attention to the boundless fertility of the
island, its suitability as a field for the culture of
cane (which is indigenous), coffee, tea and vanilla
—its wealth of pearl-shell and its probable rich-
ness in minerals. Thirdly, the Governor draws
attention to the spread of law and order, and
invites capital to step over and invest, asserting
that in 20 or 30 years New Guinea will export
more produce than the whole of the South Sea
Islands. ’Twas ever thus—first the missionary,
then the military Governor with law and order,
then the exploiting.capitalist, and lastly a civilised
nigger crawling over the bones of his compatriots
into a civilised gave.

Archibald Forbes thinks that in the next
great war the wounded will be left pretty much
to take their chance. Owing to Maxim guns,
magazine rifles, and smokeless powder, a battle
will be a sudden and frightful convulsion at long
range, and the damage done under favourable
circumstances will be tremendous. But when the
defeated army has retired it won’t be harried in
its retreat by cavalry after the old style, because no
cavalry dare come to close quarters with the new
weapons, therefore the force which is beaten will
often be only a shade less efficient than the one
which.is victorious. And if the victorious army
hampers itself with multitudes of wounded, its
enemy of yesterday will probably be able to come
back and mash it up. Therefore, Forbes considers
that the wounded soldier of the next great cam-
paign will have to shift in a great measure for
himself and take his chance. What that chance
will amount to depends on circumstances. When
Soult left his wounded behind him in some of his
hasty retreats in Spain, they were mostly crucified
feet-upwards on barn doors, and had fires lighted
under their heads, and the world hasn’t improved
so very much since then.

WORDSWORTH UP-TO-DATE.
A goburra in native trim—
The settlers’ gum-tree clock of yore—
Whooping afar his bush-born hymn.
Aloft, in mock-muezzin whim
From leafy minaret or limb,
At daydawn grey, in gloaming dim—
A laughing jackass was to him,
“ And it was nothing more.”
GRIP.
The baby province of Tasmania has also
got a deficit—not much of a deficit in itself
but a stupendous affair for the serious little
island to tackle. Premier Fysh proposes
to meet the difficulty by levying a stamp
duty on receipts, a tax of Id. each on theatre,
concert and circus tickets —pious tea-fights and
the coming Exhibition alone excepted, and a
duty of £5 per head on stallions and .£1 on bulls.
This is almost suggestive of the desperate ex-
pedients once resorted to by the Swedish Govern-
ment in a time of great emergency, when a tax
was levied on the most sacred emotions of the
community, and any one who had such emotions
without having them stamped was liable to be run
in as a smuggler.
Journalist : “ Why are vast changes wel-
tering in the Argus? Because the proprietary is
wearing and bouting ship. There are a lot of men
on hand, vigorously trained for a traditional
Argus, which is shrinking up like water on a
pavement, under a hot sun, while the new Argus
grows up within, to blossom as the aloe. The
proprietary is not behind the time. It under-
stands all the changes that are necessary, in a broad
Americanisation, which obviously creeps on, week
by week. The shorthander sinks to a discount,
and your typical Argus man has no notion beyond
the mechanical.”
When N.S.W. Railway Commissioner
Eddy decried Tasmania’s native timber as used
for railway sleepers, &c., he perhaps spoke without
sufficient data, as pieces of Tas. hardwood have
been sent to Hobart from all parts of the island to
prove that stuff which has lain in the ground for
15, 20, and 30 years has come out almost as sound
as when cut. Tasmanian hardwood taken from
the recently demolished Police Barracks that ad-
joined the old Van Demonian Government House
of Sir John Franklin’s day is now being utilised in
the erection of a dwelling-house, after serving for
60years “under Government.”
Dear Bulletin, —A few words about the
alleged Australian adjective. Why “ Austra-
lian ? ” Is it by adoption or by virtue of new
applications? I don’t know of any prior claim on
either ground. The word is a part of our
linguistic inheritance, and Max O’Rell notes it as
an integral part of the vernacular of Britain. As
an Australian I resent the implication that we
have any monopoly in the lurid expletive. Listen
to any English, Scotch or Irish crowd, or to the
average American letting himself loose on things
in general. Has not the conversation of all the
same gory garnishment ? Here in Maoriland it is
the forceful vocable of all classes. Nor does its
use denote poverty of thought or vocabulary. An
eloquent democratic knight confidentially remarks
that an opponent is “a fool,” and an ex-
parson of proven ability sends the same epithet
vibrating over the wires in Oxford’s cultured
bleat. And though the man who “ humped his
swag from Dim-d d-boola to Warrackna-
b y-beal” was probably an Australian ; he was
not more coarsely fantastic of tongue than Bret
Harte’s Californians or Kipling’s Anglo-Indians,
Finally, “ bloody ” is a better word than “ bally ”
or “blooming.”— Crude. [The Bulletin calls it
the “ Australian adjective ” simply because it is
more used, and used more exclusively by Austra-
lians, than by any other allegedly civilised nation.
Whether the Australian’s expletive is “a better
word ” than somebody else’s expletive has no
bearing on the case. The otherman’s expletive
is his own affair.—Ed. B.]

The Voice of the Soul.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Youth, when through our veins runs fast
The bright red stream of life,
The Soul’s Voice is a trumpet-blast
That calls us to the strife.
The Spirit spurns its prison-bars,
And feels with force endued
To scale the ramparts of the stars.
And storm Infinitude.
Youth passes ; like a dungeon grows
The Spirit’s house of clay.
The Voice that once in music rose.
In murmurs dies away.
But in the day when sickness sore
Smites on the body’s walls,
The Soul’s Voice through the breach once more
Like to a trumpet calls.
Well shall it be with him who heeds
The mystic summons, then !
His after-life with loving deeds
Shall blossom amongst men.
We shall have gifts—the gift that feels
The germ within the clod,
And hears the whirring of the wheels
That turn the mills of God !
The gift that sees with glance profound
The secret soul of things.
And in the silence hears the sound
Of vast and viewless wings I
The veil of Isis, seven-fold.
To him as gauze shall be,
Where through, clear-eyed, he shall behold
The Ancient Mystery.
He shall do battle for the True,
Defend till death the Right,
With Shoes of Swiftness Wrong pursue.
With Sword of Sharpness smite.
And, dying, he shall haply hear,
Like golden trumpets blown
For joy, far voices sweet and clear—-
Soul-voices like his own.
So welcomed may he join the Throng
Upon the Shining Shore,
As one who, after wand’ring long,
Returneth home once more !
VICTOR J. DALEY.
One of the features of the recent Chinese
plague was, according to the Hongkong Tele-
gkaph, the cowardliness and ineptitude of the
“ medical missionaries ”to China. Although the
authorities advertised for volunteers, no member
of the cloth came forward to render assistance.
Truth (London) waxes indignant at the
fact that a woman was fined <£l apiece on 02 par-
tridge eggs, found in her possession and supposed
to have been poached. Which recalls that a decent
Scotchman, who was one of Victoria’s richest
squatters, was originally sent out here for ten
years at Government expense for stealing 11
pheasant’s eggs.
The germ of “A Yellow Aster?” From
Mannington Caffyn’s novel, “Miss Milne and I” :
It has been for years a theory of mine that women feel
neither pleasure nor pain as men do, that they have
neither mentally, morally, nor physically the same
capacity of appreciation. Pass a hot plate around the
table, and the men will howl while the women smile.
Again:
There is your modern woman who does feel, and, thanks
to evolution, education, the divine order, or what you
like, is trying to feel keenly, standing on the nebulous
heights of womanhood’s coming heritage—that is, to
include, we are told, a man’s power of grasping facts with
a woman’s intuitive appreciation of them—and in|the
haze of the dawn, blessed with but little of either.
“H. J. Mac.” gives adders and other
snaix a rest and is off on a fresh tack :
Dear Bulletin, —We are retrograding. There is no fun
in us nowadays and no fight. The history of the navvies
camp has yet to be written. In the real old bygone
navvies’ camp there was a deeper and darker hell than
has been found in shearers’. Hell was written all over it
in big, black letters. And yet there was fun in those
camps—wild, unnatural hellish fun. I saw some of this
kind of fun 25 years ago. It was on the Southern line,
and there was a spree and a fight and an inquest, and
then another spree and some more fighting and more
inquests. It all began and ended over “ Wild Fergusson,
a red-headed navvy, 6ft. 4in. in his bare feet. His oaths
were rugged, snappy and terrifying to listen to. Every
navvy on the line owed him a thrashing, for he had
thrashed everyone of them. One pay-night the mob
from Johnson’s Cutting, who were Irish to a man—and
there were 34 of them —made it up to give him the
“ father of a bating,” and “ Wild Fergusson," who was
flaming drunk, staggered right into the midst of them.
For a moment all seemed lost. Hell was let loose. So
was Fergusson—or he got loose ; and seizing a
stout butt of a man named Dwyer by the
collar of his shirt and the seat of his moleskins he
began to use him as a battering-ram, and floor all within
reach, at the same time kicking out backwards with equal
results while he kept up a torrent of blasphemy that
fairly laid the dust. Tiring of this he threw his extempore
battering-ram wildly into the air and caught it by the
legs as it neared earth again, and then with renewed
vigour began swinging it round and knocking down eight
men with every revolution. Then he paused for wind
and while doing so, threw down Dwyer and picked
up Morgan, with whom he knocked down Gallagher
and stunned Ryan. Between the murder-meaning
yells, Morgan flew from his hands at a tangent,
knocking down Rogan, Gilligan, and Hayes, and
meanwhile Ferguson found a substitute in Duggan
whom he was whirling round his head with one hand
and singing “ Highland Mary” [with the other?—Ed. B.j
when daylight broke and the police came. After this
there was temporary peace, and that evening the
coroner’s jury returned a verdict that Michael Dwyer
and Terence Rooney died “through the visitation of
God.” Yes, there’s a bigger hell than Henry Lawson 8
shearing shed, and that’s the navvy's camp. Why, at
Mandurama, only a few years ago, after the pubs, closed
for the night and a beastly drunken mob was staggering
home to camp the “ ganger ” fell into Mandurama OreeK,
and out of over 30 men—Great God 1 this is true-not one
would save him. They all said, “ Let the ——• stop there
and drown, ** And he did I Men ctve in shearing-
sheds—in navvies’ camps, never. The shearing-shed is to
the navvy’s camp what Paradise is to Hell; but I like
neither, and hate both. I once saw a shearer drive his
shears up to the handle in a kicking sheep, and I once
saw a navvy who was refused more beer pick up a beauti-
ful pet butcher-bird and tear its head off with his teeth, 1
This isn’t very nice, but it’s picturesque and
truthful-looking, and the means of relieving the
Mac. from a great pressure of gall.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Bosh 1” shouted a sudden voice out of
the shadows.
The two traders started. It was hours since
their compotator had fallen ingloriously to ie
first bottle of “De Kuyper,” and they were by
this time well downstairs in the second,
Fleming half-filled a tumbler and took it over
to the hammock. “You’re supposed to ’ve been
killed in the first act, old cock! But, since you y e
come to life again, just get this down your neck,
and explain! What’s bosh ? ’
The gin went down, and Daddy Murchison sat
up. “ Help me out!” he said, and the ginger-
headed giant half-lifted him to the floor. The old
man up-ended again the gin case that had gone
down with him, and sat blinking disreputably at
the lamp for a minute before he said : “ I heard
you chaps blatherskitin’ about cannibalism. No
such thing in Borneo ! —you settled that all right,
didn’t you ?”
Gardiner foresaw contradiction. “No, daddy!
—no! We want your opinion first, you know !”
“Shows your sense, tool Three years in th®
Pel ago, I heard you say you were. And Bui
locky Fleming, here—he thinks he knows a lump
because he’s been about twice as long 1 But I’ve
been 35 years amongst the islands, young man;
and I say there’s cannibalism—plenty of it among

smoke. “ Cock- sure little animal it is !” he said.
“ But the question is—what proof have you th’

took a gulp of gin, and sat down again, shaking.
The others—smiling no longer—said not a word.
There was some ugly reality behind this!
Daddv Murchison smote his ancient fast upon
the table. “I’ll tell ’em!” he muttered By
God! I must tell somebody before I die ! tie
forced a mirthless smile, and lit his pipe- Ufa,
you needn’t look like that, Bullocky ! No more
cranky than yourself; though I’ve a lot more
reason to be! '’ . ... ~
Puff, puff for half-a-minute—then, with the
suddenness of a man keeping himself to the
C “ There was a chap used to make the round-trip
with trade—Singapore across Landak, down to
Banjermassin, and away round again, by the east
coast, up to Shanghai, with trepang and birds -
nests and things. ’Bout 30 years ago, it was;
before the Dutchies had squared things up much ;
and, you bet, it was risky work. How Blinker
Johnson—that was the name he went by-
managed to escape the pumpaks, I dunno; unless
’twas because he was such an infernally bad lot,
himself. Runaway mate of an American barque,
he was ; put a bullet through his skipper some-
where up among the Carolines. I was knockin
about Banjermassin, dead - broke, and when
Blinker told me he wanted a hand I thought I
might as well try my luck up in Chow-land.
“Never got there! I wasn’t over-holy.then—
ain’t, now, for that matter!—but such a G-od-
forgotten set of wretches as Blinker’s crew never
came together in one bottom ! Good-sized lump
of a brig, she was —but manned three times over.
Half-a-dozen whites—the rest all sorts and
colours, and every man of ’em a bigger scoundrel
than the next 1 Before we commenced our north-
ing I was full of it. In fact, my life wasn’t worth
a button among ’em, after they guessed what 1
thought of ’em; and, when Blinker plugged a
Sunda-man for droppin’ a marlin’spike from the
main-t’gallan’-yard, I swore to myself that—sink
or swim—l wouldn’t round Cape Kamiungun with
him.
“ A couple of days after that I got a chance;
we anchored in the mouth of a middling big river.
I forget its name, but there was a Dyak place just
above that was a good mark for swallows’ nests—
the kind the Chinkies eat, you know. I got away
all right. Chanced the sharks, I did, and swam
ashore in the darkness. Blinker kicked up a
devil of a splash, but the Dyaks kept me snug,
and he had to make sail without me.
“ Well, the Dyaks round there ain’t a bad sort,
if you don’t rub ’em the wrong way. The Orang-
Kaya took a great fancy to me, and nothing d
do him, after a bit, but I must go with ’em on a
raid against a village about 20 miles up-nyer.
Same old game, it was—came down on ’em just
before day, fired the roofs, and dropped ’em as
they bolted. The poor devils didn’t have a show,
and our fellows got nearly a couple of hundred
heads, besides a big haul of women and kids.
Half-a-dozen young-men prisoners they had, too,
but 1 didn’t know much about Dyaks then, and
I saw nothing strange in that.
“When we got back there was a big spread.
All the usual stinkin’ cookery the Dyaks are so
gone upon, and a lot more that I could see
was special for the occasion. Plenty of tuak, too,
and the women, as usual, eggin’ on the men to
drink, till three parts of ’em tumbled off their
perches. The chief was a hard old case, though,
and, when another gorge came on, some time
towards morning, he tackled it like a wolf.
Peckish, mvself, I was; and sober; for I could n t
stomach thed d rot-gut of tuak then as I can
now. Reg’lar demon to stuff himself, the Orang
was ; and, d’ye know, it gave me a queer kind of
a shiver to see the look of him into a big brass pot
that four young women put down before him.
Some kind of a stew, it smelt like, and a lot of
’em gathered round while the old boy fished out
a piece and scoffed it. Then he looked at me and
said something, and all the others looked, too, and
started laughing.
“ The Orang called me over and asked if I
would like some. ‘ Yes,’ I said, for I understood
some of their lingo; and then they all guffawea
again. I couldn’t make it out; but there
be much harm in the stuff or the old man wouldn’t
have smacked his lips over it. I took the piece lie
offered me —about the size of a mutton-chop, it
was—and, then, seeing how they were all watch-
ing me, I thought I’d ask what it was, at all
events. The old villain showed all his sharkined
teeth. 'Orang!' says he. Well, he was the
Orane, himself —the Orang-Kaya ; so I supposed
it was some special dish of his own, and that ho
wanted to do me honour. But orang-kaya means
‘rich man,’ and, as I said the words over to my
self, it all came clear to me in a flash. ‘ Orang—
man!’ I pitched the horror away, and made for
the door as if Satan was after me!”

For half-a minute the old man sat silent—
recalling the scene ; then he reached out his hand
—steady now—as was the eye beneath the bushy
white brow. Gardiner pushed him the bottle.
Fleming got up and cut himself a pipeful before —
like a man who half-dreaded the answer—he asked
—“So you got away all right, Daddy?”
Daddy slowly re-lighted his own pipe, and
eclipsed himself with vapour.
“No, Fleming, lad—not that turn 1 I was col-
lared at the door and brought back to the chief.
His face was like the devil’s in a picture, with his
eyes like a cornered cobra’s, and his lips curled
clean away from his black, crocodile teeth. He
had his parang in his hand, and he lifted it to
make a slash at me. I thought I was a goner,
and no mistake, but he didn’t strike. He says
something to one of the women, and she fishes out
another chunk of dreadfulness, and holds it out to
me. I looked at the chief, and he jabbered some-
thing I didn’t quite understand. But I under-
stood that he meant business—l had seen that
parang at work before ! ’Twas ’’ —Daddy put
down his pipe and groaned—“’Twas—cannibal—
or—dead-un — that’s what it was !”
Fleming knocked over the bottle as he jumped
to his feet again.
“ Good God! old man, you don’t mean to
say .”
Gardiner sat still. “Of course he does ! It’s
clear it wasn’t dead-un, so it must have been .”
“ Cannibal J” screeched the old man —smashed
his pipe on the table, and rushed out into the
glimmering dawn.
• • •
“ Mad ?” asked Fleming.
Said Gardiner —“Queer, to begin with —and
queerer for the liquor. But that was no madman’s
yarn !’’
The big man shuddered right through his six-
feet-three. “Faugh ! to think we’ve been drinkin’
with a man-eater !”
“Rubbish! Drinking with a man who pre-
ferred his life to his prejudices, that’s all. I don’t
envy him the fix ; but if it had been mine .”
“ You’d have done the same ?”
“Bet your pretty little boots I would !”
“ Bullocky ” doubled his historic fist, “ You’re
a better-educated man than me, Mr. William
■Gardiner —by a jugful! Seen a lot more, too, in
some w'ays. But, by gum ! if I thought you meant
what you said ”
“ You’d get plugged, old man—that’s all ! Lay
a finger on me, Mr. Bullocky Fleming, and I’ll
blow a hole in you ’fore you can take it off again!”
The giant gasped. “ Thought you was a man,
Gardiner! ”
“Man? Exac’ly: Nine-stone man! Very
reason I don’t intend to be knocked about by
eighteen-stone of bull-beef and stupidity ! See ? ”
The Mandhar trader saw. He, too, had a
“gun” at his belt, but he wasn’t in it at that
game with the Californian.
“ Don’t be an ass, Fleming, as well as a bullock!
Man that comes for me gen’lly gets left! Take
another ‘ wheel-greaser ’ and we’ll have a look for
poor old Fly-by-night. If he’s not exac’ly mad,
he’s not overpoweringly sane, either, and I don’t
like the way he skedaddled. Hello—what's this?”
“This” was a scribbled scrap of paper, pre-
sented by a Dyak boy with the awe due to the
mysterious, soundless words of white men.
Dear Gardiner,—Don't bother about me. I’ve felt for
a long time as if I must let out this horror. Don’t think
I’m mad ! The thing’s true enough ; so true that, now its
out, I'm going to do what I should have done long ago.”
“ Make away with himself, eh ?” Fleming said,
when Gardiner handed him the scrawl; “ Beat
thing he can do, too !”
“ Bigger fool than I took him for ! Come on,
and we’ll have a look for him ! No use asking
young yellowskin anything; primed with his
answer I”
• • #
The sun had hardly hove his deep-red disc
clear of the cold blue jungle-line beyond the
woolly-misted river—yet all the village was astir
with men that ran to swell a throng about the
Orang’s house —though few had ventured to join
the little group upon the platform.
The crowd fell back, right and left, from the
ladder-foot, as the white men came. Gardiner
wondered at the shame-faced greeting of the few
whose eyes met his. “What is it, brothers ?” he
called out, in Dyak, but only the Orang answered,
from above.
“ Come up, white brother ; he is here!”
“Corpse, I suppose!” and Gardiner scrambled
up.
Murchison wasn’t quite a corpse. His eyes had
recognition in them, and he faintly moved a hand.
Gardiner stooped—lifted the sarong that lay over
the old man’s chest —dropped it suddenly, and
faced fiercely round upon the Orang.
“ Who?” he said.
The Orang pointed down to the dying man.
“ Hear, first, his words. The time is very short.”
The bloodless lips were moving feebly. Gardiner
lay down upon the bamboos to bring his ear to the
old man’s mouth.
“It was Eki, the smith ; but I forced him to do
it. Spat on him, I did, and then he wouldn’t; so
I struck him in the face, and then ”
“ He gave you a slash that would have killed a
buffalo ! S’pose you know it’s a finisher ? ”
“ Yes ! They’ve stopped the Weedin’ a bit, but
I know it’s a case with me—as I meant it to be !
New thing in sui ’
Death took the last syllable.
• # •
For the killing of Roderick Murchison,
Eki, the smith, was arraigned before a court that
combined less “ frill ” with more expedition than
any other upon record.
Gardiner at top of the table in his store—
Fleming on his right hand ; on his left, Musman,
the Orang-Kaya. At bottom, the accused, dis-
armed and bound ; behind him a crowd of gaping
Dyaks and a Malay or two from a prahu in the
river.
Facts clear enough. Eki was rolling a cigar;
white man walked up and “ made spittle ” in his
face. Eki dropped cigar and took hold of parang.
Then white man struck, and Eki cut him down."
Mr. Justice Fleming would acquit the prisoner.
“It was a devil of a thing to be ‘landed ’ on the
nose without warning!”
Mr. Justioe Musman concurred. It was evident
the white man wanted to be killed. “The
prisoner had merely obliged him !”
Chief-Justice Gardiner opined that this was all
d d rubbish 1 A Dyak had killed a white
man ! There was severe provocation; but this
Court wasn’t going to establish the precedent that
a Dyak might kill a white man upon any provoca-
tion ! He found prisoner guilty, sentenced him
to be shot, and then and there—before anybody
could lift a finger— did shoot him !
The petrifaction of amazement rested for a
moment on the assemblage—then the Orang
headed a stampede for the door, and in half-a-
minute only Gardiner and Fleming were left with
the corpse. “ Bullocky,” too, got up to go, but at
the door he turned.
“Gardiner,” he said—“you can shoot me, if
you like ! —but I say you’re not a man I—you’re a
devill”
Ihe little man laughed, “Don’t want to shoot
you, Bullocky !—not worth it! Get away home
to Maudhar, and peddle cocoa-nuts —it’s about all
you re fit for ! As for me, I’m no devil—l'm only
live-man Gardiner!”

The Beantree and the Gum.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Thus spake the beantree to the stately gum ;
lo west, yon cloud forebodes the storm wilj
come—
“ Already as it looms against the day
Within its leaden folds the lightnings play.
“ My roots are thirsting in the barren soil,
And in my parched veins the warm saps boil.
“Yet, though my languid leaves are faint for
wind,
I know the gods above are good and kind.”
“The gods care nought,” the grim, great gumtree
said,
“Else had thy sisters lived, who stand there dead.
“ ’Twas not for mercy’s sake that thou wast spared,
They lingered, perishing, and no one oared.”
Through all the moaning wood the tempest swept,
And for her sisters dead the beantree wept.
And, as the thunder rumbled overhead,
The beantree, sobbing, to the gumtree said ;
“The ways they work in how can worldlings
know?
Or who can say that ’twere not better so ?”
“Thy sullen heart is written in thy face,
But in my prayers always thou hast a place.
“ They bend the haughty, but they heed the prayer
Of humble hearts, take heed, they do not spare !”
And then the storm broke o’er them as they
stood—
“I only know,” the beantree said, “ the gods are
good.”
Flung down between them fell an angry shaft—
A grim, sardonic laugh, the gumtree laughed.
For all her faith the beantree bowed her hair,
And, trembling, called upon her gods to spare.
Against the day, clear-cut, the gumtree stood
With brooding brows above the rustling wood.
And in the fragrance of the freshened morn
The stricken beantree lay, with roots uptorn.

were : —Births, 404 ; marriages, 117 ; deaths, 451.

His Star of Bethlehem.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He had had several drinks, and he left the
shanty at midnight for his hut, with a candle in
his hand. That candle was his ‘‘Star of Beth-
lehem. ”
The path curled round a steep bluff of sandstone
reef. I orty feet below it was the creek-bed—a
tailings-deposit.
The candle went out. The pick-handle revolved,
i-i 6 ( an d beef tied round his neck
like the books of a school-boy, swayed to the left'
The man followed the bag. He tilted. He
crashed through the fragile scrub : he disappeared.

The glory of a drunken man is, that when
he falls, he falls limp. He is like a baggy pants.
jc our stiff-set individual presents a resistance that
destroys him.
In the bed of that creek, when the sun rose next
morning, was a flattened bag of bread and beef.
An ox-tongue protruded from a gap in the bag.
These instances of tongue-protrusion are charac-
teristically diversified in our own species. The
man had again disappeared.

At 4 a.m. Simpson groped his way into
the hut and struck the bed. His mate woke
grumbled, and slept afresh. Morning brought a
revelation. Simpson couldn’t move. He was
caught between shoulders. There was an ugly
scar on his cheek, and both arms looked as if
pared down with a spokeshave.
They decided to take a holiday. Tea and
sausages for breakfast—Simpson stayed in bed.
At 11 o’clock, Jones (a neighbour) put in his
head saying, “ It’s a good job you fellows
stayed at home to-day—a slip of a thousand tons
buried your claim an hour ago. Didn’t you hear
the row ?”

Justice Chubb (Townsville) lately com-
mitted to prison one Hopkins for contempt of
court. Hopkins failed to produce certain papers
in the estate of a deceased person whose widow he
had married —hence the contempt. In gaol Hop-
kius was pronounced insaneand sent to Woogaroo;
in Woogaroo he was pronounced sane and sent
home. Naturally, Hopkins is somewhat wroth,
for he has been pronounced, on good authority, to
be unfit for liberty ; unfit for gaol—and, finally,
unfit for Woogaroo.

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FA¥ENC.
With Prefatory Note hy Rolf Roldreivood.
_K,C O J a Uli U i, 1 3" L 'J
Opinions of tlie Press :
“ The vohime takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they nil stand pretty well on a par. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the- whiles and the natives in these faraway
parts. ’ A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—3nVl. Herald, July 8, 1803.
■ “No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He. too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best'work. That they will be widely rend is certain,”— Sidney Mail, July 8, 1893.
*• They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild places
when human hearts arc stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especia ly noticeable in ‘Spirit Led,' which the great American might have written. ‘ A Cup of Cold Water’ is. perhaps, the
best tale in a collection that should he widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to .purely Australian literature. Daily Telegraph,
July 15,1893.
‘“The Last of Six and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third oFThe
Buii ktin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15,1893.
