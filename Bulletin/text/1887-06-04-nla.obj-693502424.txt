THE BULLETIN,
SATURDAY, JUNE 4, 1887.
Afi'Eß a temporary outburst of half hearted
enthusiasm the cause of Australian Federa-
tion has been allowed, by the majority of
colonial statesmen, to sink almost into obli-
vion. The grand project by which the
English-speaking laces of the South Pacific
were to be united into a powerful nation,
strong for all purposes of defence and pre-
pared to speak with one voico whenever its
lights or liberties were threatened, has re-
sulted only in the formation of a disjointed
league, which tvas crippled at the very out-
set by the defection of three of the most
important colonies of the Australian group,
and which, so far, appears to lack almost
every essential element of cohesion. The
British Government, which might have done
much to promote the cause of union, has
been more anxious to establish a great Im-
perial league as a means of foreign aggression
than to aid a movement, the objects of which
were entirely peaceful, and by a lavish dis-
tribution of meaningless titles has done its
utmost to show our venal statesmen that
the advocacy of British rather than Aus-
tralian interests is the shortest road to royal
favour. The comparatively feeble hold
which the Cabinet at London has upon these
colonies rendered it difficult for even the
most Conservative of English ministers to
offer any open opposition to the federal
movement in Australia, but the entire pro-
ject was at variance with the spirit of
Disk a klian statesmanship in almost every
particular. In a united form the rising
nation of the Pacific would be likely to prove
an unwieldy and overbearing member of the
filibustering confederacy which it is fondly
hoped will one day overshadow the globe
and make the fairest portion of this earth a
prospecting ground for the apostles of British
gin and British bayonets, and a Federal
Council, backed by the entire strength of a
new continent, would be too apt to ask the
reason why, instead of yielding unquestion-
ing obedience, when called upon to assist in
settling foreign quarrels on the banks of the
Danube or in the defiles of the Hindoo*
Koosh. As a weapon to be used in the
cause of British Jingoism a divided Australia
would be of inestimably greater value than a
league of eight powerful colonies, and the
colonial politicians who have done their
utmost to retard A ustralian Federation for
the greater honour and glory of the British
Crown, deserve, for that act, to be remem-
bered with execration on the pages of history
as long as history shall endure. -
But, unhappily, Australia is in some sense
at war with herself, and even the partial
union which has been already effected is
hollow and untrue. The Conference which
met at Hobart nearly two years ago was
little better than a mutual admiration society
of self-appointed delegates who represented
animosities rather than interests, and who,
by the very circumstances of the colonies
from which they derived their authority,
were totally unfitted to legislate in the name
of a united nation. The present artificial
divisions of Australia appear to have been
devised for the express purpose of promot-
ing discord, and, although this continent is
even now only beginning to be populated, it
is already evident that complete disintegra-
tion is required before any real system of
federation can become possible. The curse
of over-centralisation enables four large
cities to exercise almost absolute control
over as many important colonies, and the
inhabitants of the country districts have
been so long accustomed to see their in-
terests sacrificed to those of their respective
capitals that their views have become nar-
rowed ; their energies are all absorbed
in scrambling for local concessions, and
a parochial question regarding a new
bridge or a public school becomes o
vastly greater importance than a matter
which affects the future well-being of an
entire continent. In more than one in
stance, too, this jealousy has developed into
active hostility, and the colonies which it l
proposed to unite are themselves disunitec
and on the verge of disruption. To the in
habitant of Northern Queensland, Brisbane
is now a Nazareth out of which no gone
thing can come, and when Sir Samuel Gkif
fith and his servile colleague profess to
speak in an Australian Council in the name
of that State they are well aware that two
thirds—in point of area—of the colony which
they represent would gladly repudiate their
words if only because of the personality o;'
the utterers. The Welsh lawyer who poses
as the patron of the Chinaman and the
heathen virtually speaks for the merest
fraction of a vast dependency. Northern
Queensland has, so far, had no real voice in
tho question of Australian Federation, and
when a Parliament sitting at Townsville
has an opportunity to pronounce on this
great question it may resolve on a policy of
isolation, as much from hatred towards its
ancient tyrant and his policy as from sober
conviction. And the politicians of New
South Wales, when, in adhesion to Dalley’s
grovelling theories of “loyalty,” they pre-
ferred to stand aloof from a movement which
tended towards national rather than imperial
union, spoke also in the name of a disunited
people. The Riverina district is, in all but
the name, Victorian territory, and its in-
habitants, though forced to accept the re-
sults of the tortuous policy which prev ails in
the Assembly at Sydney, have but little
sympathy with it at any time, whether in its
external or internal relations. Tho northern
districts of New South Wales are openly
disaffected, and are anxious to repudiate all
connection with the Parliamentary prize-
ring which curses in their name and makes
them sharers in its folly and disgrace ; but
they, too, were dragged along as victims to a
policy which was prepared to sell the cause
of Australian union for Glory, a Donkey, and
a Goat ; and the Northern Territory, in this
as in every other matter, could only speak
with the voice of a colony to which it was
united by nothing save a load of debt and a
telegraph-wire across the desert. Amidst all
these difficulties, Australian Federation can
hardly be said to have had even the sem-
blance of a fair trial.
* * *
Disintegrationand a re-division into States
has now become one of the most urgent re-
quirements of this continent. At the pre-
sent moment Brisbane no more represents
Queensland, nor Sydney, New South Wales,
than Berlin does the views and requirements
of Alsace-Lorraine, and the spirit of seces-
sion is everywhere abroad. Northern
Queensland especially is loud and almost
unanimous in its demands for freedom, but
the brute force of the Southern majority
obstinately refuses the concession. In a
democratic community the voice of tho
people is—in theory—the voice of a god,
but the barren pride and the earth-hunger of
Brisbane statesmen lead them to treat their
fellow countrymen rather as conquered ene-
mies than as free citizens, while, true to its
Imperial instincts, a British Government
engaged in brutally coercing an Irish mino-
rity refuses to permit Separation unless
granted with the consent of the Assembly
which, by its actions, has made Separation
imperative. But as population increases, the
necessity for a readjustment of boundaries
will become more and more apparent all
over the continent. The huge, unwieldy
colonies which now disfigure the map of
Australia require to be broken up into a
multitude of small states, each with an
elected Governor and its own Legislature,
and then—and not till then—will genuine
federation become practicable. The pious
politicians of Adelaide, who waste their sit-
tings in discussing the clauses of a prayer to
be recited at the opening of an exhibition,
cannot legislate for ever in matters connected
with a tropical land in the Far North which
few of them ever saw, and which they hardly
know except as a barbarous region where
there are gold and sugar and alligators
and fevers, and thousands of Chinamen and
all manner of red-shifted wickedness ; and
the diggers and sugar-planters of the Gulf
will not endure much longer the rule of the
auctioneers, and publicans, and insolvent land
brokers of Queen-street, Brisbane. Every
million added to the population of Australia
will be accompanied by demands for more
and more separation until the continent is
divided into states of manageable dimensions,
and to resist such demands is struggling with
fate. The unwieldy empire of Alexander.
whore half Asia turned on the pivot of the petty
kingdom of Maeedon, had as many elements of
stability as the overgrown colonies which are
now held together m defiance of all the laws of
reason and expedience and political gravita-
tion.
The outlay required to maintain a multi-
plicity of separate governments is now
urged as one of the chief reasons why a
continent, which nature intended for di-
vision into at least twenty states, should be
compressed into five cumbrous provinces, but
this so-called reason is hardly worthy of
notice. Australia, at present, is governed
too much, and is yet governed to very little
purpose. Officers have been multiplied for
the more purpose of corruption, and the
theory that the subdivision of the colony in-
volves a vast and inevitable increase of ex-
pense is only based on the supposition that
this corruption is necessarily to last for ever.
In reality, however, a small state requires
governing machinery only in proportion to
its population ; it needs no great array of
parliamentary representatives or cabinet
ministers such as may be expedient in larger
States, and, above all, it can dispense with
the luxury of a nominated foreign Governor
whose pomp must be proportioned to his
rank, and whose salary increases in direct
ratio to his “social ' importance and his
ignorance alike of the country and its re-
quirements. An elective Governor is not
only likely to prove more useful and less
expensive, but he accords better with the
views of a people who are for the most part
indillerent to the imported elegance of abraiu-
less man with nothing to do. The boss
Janissary who is supposed to act as head of
the colonial forces in time of war and head
of the State in time of peace, is, as a rule, a
personage who knows little of campaigning
and less of statesmanship, and in his person
one of the chief objections to the re-division
of Australia may safely be struck off the list.
* » *
Lastly, if federation is to succeed in Aus-
tralia, as it has done on a larger scale in the
United States, it is essential that the repre-
sentatives of each colo iy should be elected
directly by the people. The system by which
a Premier appoints himself and his chief but-
toner to sit in the highest council of the
nation is too hazardous to be continued
long without disaster, and it places an-
amount of power in the hands of one man
which few can be trusted to exercise rightly.
In many cases it happens that the head of
the Government owes his seat to the suffrages
of the electors in some obscure village, and
achieves power by a happy accident, by
treachery, or by compromise. In many
respects his views may be those of his own
constituency only, and the statesman who
speaks on behalf of an entire commonwealth
should bo chosen on no such narrow and un-
certain basis, but should hold his position by
the clearly expressed will of the people.
Australian Federation has, so far, been a
failure chiefly because it has been run upon
strictly Conservative principles which have
rendered the Federal Council little better
than a committee of irresponsible nominees.
The New Zealand Legislature, where the
Stout-Voukl combination reigned upon suf-
ferance and clung to office in spite of defeat
after defeat, naturally objected to a
scheme 1 y which a c uple of persons, who
did not even pretend to possess the con-
fidence of the House, should be des-
patched to a place where they could legislate
without any criticism or interference except
what they might receive from a mutual ad-
miration society of Premiers, some of whom
were in almost equally bad case. In New
South Wales the most important question
almost of the century was settled by the
Parliament which disgraced itself by con-
doning the Soudan piracy ; the opinion
of the country was never taken on the mat-
ter, and in South Australia it was dealt with
in a somewhat similar fashion. A scheme
by which a new nation was to be created
was disposed of almost as cavalierly as if it
had been an invitation to free drinks, and
the nation was hardly even asked if it cared
to be created or not. Ac it happened, how-
ever, this point was of little importance. A
league formed by a union of colonies, some
of which were themselves well-nigh falling
asunder, was hardly likely to be permanent.
Disintegration and Decentralisation are the
first wants of Australia, and true Federation
will be only possible after they have been
achieved.
The Relics Speak.
Parkes is the political fox without a tail. The
tail is Respectability. The want of it as a
posterial covering is always troubling the old
man. He keeps trying to get imitation ones to
stick on, and then goes around drawing attention
to his extremities. No politician ever talked so
much about his “ principles” and “hinlentions ”
as Parkes does, and yet everyone knows that, as
for principles, he has none, and all his intentions
are summed up in making himself and his Govern-
ment gee. “To successfully conduct Govern-
ment,” as he said the other day, that is the be-all
and end-all of Sir Henry Parkes. His last re-
spectability self-advertisement dodge was to
gather together all the fossil remains of our
primal legislators and gave them a dinner. There
were 62 members of our first Australian Legisla-
tive Assembly. Twelve attended the feed, eight
were either in England or in the country, one was
“somewhere in Queensland,” and the remaining 11
(who are dead) were in various other cli-
mates. Of these 62 old original law-makers
all have dropped off, “full up” of serving
their country in Parliament, save Parkes.
Parkes is the last of the leeches, and he has such
a frightful appetite that he is never likely to be
full up of serving his country until his country is
full up of serving him—which will be presently.
Well, these 21 surviving legislators are nothing,
if not respectable, and that was no doubt
the only reason for which Sir Henry got them
together. He wanted a tail; he wanted to be
respectable, too. There was nothing appropriate
in such a meeting. It was not a fiftieth anniver-
sary ; it was not even a thirtieth ; it was a thirty-
first. “And Mr. Alfred Bennett was also
present.” In the name of Heaven and of the first
spelling-book, why Mr. Alfred Bennett ?
Parkes opened proceedings, and proposed the
first toast. “ I think Queen Victoria,” he said,
“ by far the greatest constitutional monarch that
England ever had.” The question is, what is a
constitutional monarch ? If the constitutional
monarchs of England mean all the fatuous or
utterly imbecile individuals of that great array,
then it may safely be conceded that poor Victoria
is possibly the greatest of them. “Throughout
these 50 years,” he went on, “ the reign of our
Queen lias been, as it were, an increasing volume
of influence in favor of human progress.” An in-
ceasing volume of God forsaken nonsense ! Wh
single act of Queen Victoria's, public or private
can be cited by anyone as an influence in favou
of human progress ? ” We forget. After one
her innumerable acco uchcments she ofiicialy warnet
the women of England not to take chloroform
It had not agreed with her. That is one fo
“ human progress,” anyway ! “It is impossib
to Eay,” added Sir Henry, warming to his wor c
with an affectionate recollection of the oyster
“It is impossible to san that even the emancipation of
slaves of the areal republic which speaks our own lamjua
-might.not have been further delayed had it not been for t 4
beneficent influence which fostered, promoted, and expanded
under the reign of Queen Vtctoria."
At this all the twenty surviving legislator
present cheered as one antediluvian leech, a ■
though everybody knows quite well that the sym
pal liy of the Queen and her spouse was, in th
American war, steadily in favour of the South—
theCotton-cum-Tobaeco-and-Slave Power, and tha
the States bear England a grudge to this day i
consequence. “In my judgment," he wound up
“ as compared with any of her predecessors, the presen
Sovereign of the British Empire stands out with anelevatio
of purpose and a grandeur of effect far beyond any other.”
Elevation of purpose ? Grandeur of effect ? Wha
does the man mean i It is a matter of history that th
sole purpose of the Queen from 1837 to 1887, from
Melbourne through Beaconsfielp to Salis
bury, has been to throw all her weight in with
the soi-disant “aristocrats,” and that she am
they have miserably failed in setting up in Eng
land an Imperialism like Bismarck and Raise
William have succeeded in setting up in Ger
many. Is such a purpose elevated 1 Is such an
effect grand ? Class rule, and a miserable failure
at that, sums up the purpose and effect of Her
Tracious Majesty Victoria “during these 50
ears.”
After the last of the leeches came the last of the
behemoths. Mr. Dailey rose to celebrate the
memory of the dead (who are still ruling N.S.W.
and to propose the health of the moribund whose
rule we are just shaking off. “The toast wai
drunk in silence." Not so “our Privy Councillor.’
He was drunk in speech. Perpend, and if this is
not pseudo-Demosthenic rhetoric gone wrong, then
it is the best imitation we have yet met with in
this vale of tears
.Sir Henry Parkes and Gentlemen,—l am sure there is
no one in the community who will not readily appreciate that
your courteous hospitality to-night is dictated by a just esti-
mate of the significance, in an historietd aspect of the even!
which our gathering is intended to celebrate .”
What grandiloquent bombast 1 And what a dose
of it he poured into “ the dear departed favour
ites ! ” Mr. Dalley uttered the futile politica
“ blow ” about them that was to be expected, and
Justice h aucett sucked it all in, preparatory to
following suit.
Then came “the last political stage of all—
sans eyes, sans teeth, sans scent, sans anything.”
Poor old Sir John Robertson, with his impo-
tent hatred of the progressive Victorian nation,
was to have his say. “ All over Australasia,” he
said, “ was freedom.”
" If wo went into such a silly course as that of the federali-
Bation of the colonies ; if we did anything of that kind, we
would simply imperil ourselves and our free action, and give
up dealing with the old country. We would give up dealing
with the old country, and would become involved with a
number of other colonies. He hoped we would never do
that.”
Ihe sentimental old pantaloon 1 Back and back
again his poor, fuddled brain came on to that ono
idea, that we might be gomg to follow Victoria’s
example and exclude the cottons and crockery,
ware, the cloths and condiments of “the old
country.”
"He hoped he ihould never live to see the day when the
ideas respecting the so-called freedom of trade, which would
open our ports to the Australasias and keep out the goods
of Great Britain, would be carried into effect."
And why, pray? Because we ought to “stand
by the old land that for 100 years has stood by us.”
It has stood by us to save time ! For 100 years it
has steadily iun counter to our every interest and
wish, steadily snubbed and flouted us, steadily
sacrificed us to the pettiest interests of parties,
and even individuals 1
Justice Faucett followed up with some
garbled Australian “history” on the same tack.
He gave an account of that precious “ Constitu-
tion ” of ours and of its results.
I he franchise, considering the times, was very wide and
comprehensive. The consequence was that the people at
large—and he saw no class distinctions—felt that it was
their interest to take an active part in public affairs. (Hoar
hoar.) They felt that by doiug so they had in their own
hands the safety and protection of their dearest interests—
the protection of their lives, their property, and their free-
dom. (Cheers.) ” “From time to time the franchise was
enlarged, extending more widely amongst the people, a rea-
son for taking a still greater interest in the wise and honest
conduct of public affairs.”
And yet everyone knows (it is the common
taunt) that no single Australasian colony
is so politically apathetic as New South
Wales. This is a fact, and being a fact it has a
reason, and that reason is that the people of New
South Wales have all along felt that they had no
hiterest in their Parliament or in any of their
rulers. The Parliament did not represent them.
It does not represent them. Who were, and arc,
the members of Assembly ? Squatters, importers’
and lawyers ; and the squatters, the importers"
and the lawyers have legislated in their own,


and only in their own, interests, and the people
have had to put up with it, because representa-
tives of the people could not afford to give their
services to the country for nothing. That is the
history of New South Wales legislation under
the British blood-suckers, and they know it.
Then Sir Henry once more got on to his legs,
and led off on the subject of Imperial Federation.
“ No plan had been formed,” he said, “ no device
promulgated, which at present was satisfactory ;
but there was no reason to doubt that as time
went on there would be some means of uniting
the vast areas of the earth which were now swayed
by the sceptre of our Queen." Not only has no
such plan been formed, no such device been pro-
mulgated, but none ever will be. And why ?
Because that big swaggering hypocritical bully
that is known among the nations as “ England,”
that canting Power that carries a Bible in one
hand and a bludgeon in the other, has about run
its course. There is not a nation that has to deal
with it but has learnt to rue its downright, deli-
berate, lying selfishness. Denmark t'.usted its
assurances, and Turkey trusted its assurances, and
Schleswig-Holstein and Bulgaria are the comment.
“ We have nothing,” said Bismarck, “ to hope or
fear from a country like England,” and that is the
everlasting truth for us all.
Sir John Hay and Mr. Macleay finished it.
Sir John opined—
" That the colonies should remain united with Great
Britain was almost necessary for their safety, and entirely 80
for their rapid extension in commence and wealth."
Bosh ! Our only danger from war lies in the fact
of our connection with England. What had
Russia to do with us, or we with Russia, that she
should war-scare us 1 The States of America in
1776 did not find it “almost necessary for their
safety” to get behind the tail of England. Quite
the contrary. And Australia of 1887 is not (ffraid
to compare itself with America of 1776. Both are
continents far removed from the scene of European
strife, but, if one of the two is more so than
another, then that one is Australia. And, as to
the need we have of England for the rapid exten-
sion of our commerce! England would carry our
commerce for us no less if we were independent
than if we were dependent. And, even if she would
not (which is unimaginable in the great commer-
cial prostitute of the world), why, the impetus
given to us by the construction of our own ships
would be simply incalculable. Mr. Macleay ac-
tually talks about a reciprocity between England
and us, to the exclusion of all other nations. If
we are going to favour, by differential duties, the
products of any sort of labour, why then let us, in
pursuance of our beloved Freetrade principle
favour the products of the cheapest labou-. 1,
u 3 shut out European goods and have a Cast jais
Treaty in favour of China and the Indian niggers.
* * »
So much for what was said at the precious
respectability, self-advertisement meeting of Sir
Henry’s. The last scene of the farce was, of
course, for one old gentleman to propose, another to
second, in very flattering terms, “ the health of
the Premier.” The old fox had his imitation tail
on all right. He had the kudos of political and
social respectability poured upon him. He was
content. He went around directing attention to
his extremities. In which proceeding, however,
he lit upon some expressions of actual veracity,
and, as these were about the only ones that trans-
pired on this occasion, we append them
" With regard to his own personal (Sorts, he was fully
aware that he hid mide many mistakes,'committed many
errors, used language that he ought not to have used, taken
courses which were hardly justified.”
And to this, by way of Anal comment, we can
sincerely say— Amen.
Attorney-General Wise.
As The Bulletin alone predicted, young Mr.
Wise has been offered and has promptly accepted
the New South Wales Attorney-Generalship.
£l5OO a year and the leadership of the New South
Wale 3 Bar sufficed to knock this hope of the Free-
traders off his perch. G. H. Reid was not such a
gull as to listen to the wiles of the alleged G.O.M.
Already Parkks’ demeanourhas in a large measure
alienated the country, and Reid, who is an un-
failing weathercock, showed his appreciation of
the facts of the situation in refusing the office so
readily snapped at by Wise. Reid took time to
consider, and sought the advice of men intimately
acquainted with the feeliog of that section of the
public whose ratification of his appointment it
was necessary to secure. Tne result was that he
discovered “ reasons ” for maintaining a position
of comparative independence in the Assembly.
Bast Sydney has certainly cooled down in its
advocacy of Parkes’ interests since the general
elections. The voters are disappointed and
angry. The magician ha 3 not employed his wand
with the dexterity they were led to anticipate.
The Calico Jemmies aie dissatisfied, the publicans
are irate, thB tobacco-manufacturere are indig-
nant, and the ma3SOf the electors are beginning to
swear at the species of salvation vouchsafed by
the confidence trickster who was to have restored
the colony to prosperity and the people to happi-
ness.
Mr. Wise has, however, with the precipitation
of inexperience and deficient perception, ignored
the drift of public opinion, and leaped into the
Ministerial boat. The New South Wales public
will be sorry for this, because they had formed
a good opinion of this promising politician, who
as a honorable and brainy man, has—despite his
Frcetrade mania—high claims on the popular
esteem. For about three years to come there will
be a Freetrade party in N. S. Wales, and so long
as there is such a party it is a c'ear ad-
vantage to have men of Wise’s calibre and
attainments as prominent members thereof. He
while such men as Parkes 'and Cocky Burns
are beneath contempt. The Bulletin and the
public had hoped, indeed, to see Wise and other
fresh politicians at the head of a new young Aus-
tralian party in the future. But he has elected to
lend himself as a link in the tail of the dirty old
crew and must take the consequences. If he is
re-elected by South Sydney it will only he because
he is not opposed by a sufficiently good man. At
time of writing the [Oppo sition leaders seem dis-
inclined to contest a bye-election at all, being im-
pressed with the idea that [the Freetraders ought
to be allowed to go to the devil in their
own way. But the local Protectionists
are not disposed to stand idly by, and
allow a Ministerial walk over. They are casting
about for a candidate to represent their views,
and have naturally turned their attention to the
foiceful and eloquent David Buchanan, who has
got the true “ hang ” of the fiscal problem requir-
ing solution. He was a Protectionist when to be
one was to be regarded as a political monstrosity ;
and has always fearlessly adhered to his faith in
spite of the guffaws of rampant majorities. In
other respects Buchanan is worthy of the hear-
tiest support. He is a true Liberal, and although
he has served in nearly every New South Wales
Assembly since the inception of responsible govern-
ment, his personal honour has never been inr
pugned. As an orator he stands unrivalled in the
mother colony, the remarkable lucidity of his argu-
mentation and hisskilful choice of language beingin
strong contrast to the involved and flatulent style
of Parkes. The circumstance of Buchanan’s
absence from the New South Wales Assembly is in
any case a matter for national regret; and even
the most maniacal Freetraders of South Sydney
might well sink their prejudices on the fiscal
question with the object of i ecuring the return of
so efficient and independent a legislator.
* * *
Another [reason for rejecting Wise in favour
of Buchanan is to be found in the fact that if
Wise’s introduc ion into the Cabinet is endorsed
by the electors Parkes will be more than ever an
autocrat. With the exception of Garrett and
Salomons, all Parkes’ turncoat colleagues are
now either far below mediocrity or too inexperi-
enced to be otherwise than mere tools in the
hands of their chief. Foster was thrown out
because he was not sufficiently plastic to serve as
a colleague for the G.O.M. And the choice of
young Wise to fill the place vacated by Foster
ought to be resented by the public as a measure
calculated to give the colony a continuance and
an increase of the one-man-power that has re-
cently been so conspicuous. Wise is a man of
parts, but in years and experience he is a mere
schoolboy. Parkes will be able to manipulate
him with ease, and it was most probably for this
reason that the selection was made. If the elec-
tors of South Sydney are content to see the insti-
tutions of the country under a mere dictatorship
they will considerably increase their reputation
for complacency.
The Parnell Forgery.
The great sensation of the Times is already dying,
if not already dead. The Tory organ still lifts up
its voice in senile denunciation of the Irish patriot
whom it hates with the unreasoning and unfathom-
able hatred of aristoeratio prejudice, but its at-
tempt to brand Parnf.ll as a murderer and liar
has signally failed, and ere long its broken purpose
will recoil upon itself. The letter on which so
much reliance was placed proves after all to be
the production rather of an unsophisticated Irish
pothouse politician than of a scholar and a states-
man, and were it not for the recollection that the
Times is English Tory, and therefore thick-
headed, it would be difficult to suppose that the
directors of that journal were deluded, even for a
moment, by so shallow a fraud. No doubt decep-
tion was rendered all the easier by the circum-
stance that the vendors of tho letter offered to
prove—no doubt for a sufficient consideration—
exactly what the Times, in its capacity as head of
the stupid party in English politics, desired, above
all things, to have proven ; but even this does not
fully account for the blindness of the self-appointed
leader of British public opinion, in falling a vic-
tim to an artifice compared to which the Acre's
Russian spy, Pastor Ciiiniquy, the “ Escaped
Nun,” and all the other delusions of the day sink
into insignificance and contempt. The arguments
with which the Times endeavours to defend its
false position are in themselves little less
than ruinous. [Like the majority of Parnell’s
epistles the letter in question purports to have
been written by a secretary and merely signed by
the Nationalist leader, but this point of resem-
blance is itself a damning argument against its
authenticity. The document is just the one pro-
duction of a lifetime which no statesman—least of
all one so cold silent, reserved, and mysterious as
Mr. Parnell— would submit to the prying eyes
of a subordinate, and the assertion that he wan-
tonly allowed a mere clerk to share so tremendous
a secret passes all belief. So far the imaginary
secretary has not been produced, neither has the
handwriting in the body of the letter been proved
to be that of Parnell’s amanuensis; but this
point appears to have attracted little attention.
The tenor of Mr. Parnell’s whole life shows
conclusively that he is not the man to employ a
hired drudge simply that he might thereby put
his own neck in a noose, and the utter reckless-
ness of the proceeding attributed to him is woithy
only of a suicide or an imbecile.
Nowhere in England—or Australia, either—
could a banker be found who would pay a cheque
on the strength of so dubious an autograph. The
contested signature—the first on the list—when
compared with those which follow, is full of dis-
points by which handwriting must be judged, and
in the forged autograph a curve almost invari-
ably comes where an angle should be, and vice
versa . The initial "C ” commences with an
acute angle in place of a loop, and ends with an
obtuse angle instead of running into the “h.”
The “S” is pointed and well-defined, and Mr.
Parnell’s is shapeless; the “ r,” on the other
hand, is shapeless, while that in the genuine
signature is well-defined; the final “1” is beauti-
fully formed, whereas it should be little better than
a stroke ; the flourish at the foot is wanting ; and,
in short, excepting that two of the capital letters
are tolerable imitations, the forgery is of the
clumsiest and most schoolboyish description. The
letter itself is crowded with great difficulty into
one sheet, while the signature appears at the head
of the next, and in the face cf this the Times’ own
expert is compelied to acknowledge that, even
supposing the signature to be authentic, the
epistle bears evidence of having been filled in on a
blank sheet to which an autograph had been pre-
viously appended. Here again the case for the
Times collapses at the very outset.
The strongest point in the indictment against
the Irish leader, however, is his neglect to take
legal proceedings against his traducers, and the
entire Tory press of England is filled wit:, taunts
at his supineness in this respect. But it must be
remembered that the task which PARNhLL’s ene-
mies call on him to under ake is one that, if pre-
maturely entered upon, is absolutely hopeless.
The informers by whom the letter was produced
will swear to its authenticity—if they failed to do
so they would probably pas 3 the greater part of
their remaining years in penal servitude, and Par-
nell can only establish his innocence by finding
and bringing to justice the original forger. Some-
where—anywhere—lost among a population of
more than 30,000,000 souls—probably hidden in
some obscure attic in the slums of an obscure
town, lies the criminal, and unless accident be-
trays his identity ten times the span of an ordi-
nary lifetime would be little enough for such a
hopeless investigation. Or, again he may be
living quietly as an ordinary citizen among the
50,000,000 souls who make up the population of
the United States ; he may be in India, or Aus
tralia, or Africa ; and when found his guilt must
be proved to the satisfac ion of an English jury
packed by the officials of the Tory Government to
whom his conviction would mean discredit and
ruin. The Times taunts its enemy with cowardice
and conscious guilt, because he does not move at
its convenience and in the face of such stupen-
dous odds as these, but Parnell wisely ignores
their challenge. He will move when he is ready,
and when he does his proofs will be overwhelm,
ing, but till then he pays no attention to the de-
mand that he should carry his unprepared ease
before a hostile jury. If he were to speak he
would probably answer with cynical contempt :
“ Yes, I will submit the case to a jury—in Cork."
But it is no part of tho Tory programme that the
Irish leader should he put on trial before twelve
of his own countrj men.
At the time of the Phoenix Park assassinations
the National leader placed himself unreservedly in
the hands of his then enemy, Mr. Gladstone, and
that veteran statesman bade him continue at his
post. The Liberal Premier, it is now known, was
the last Minister who resorted to the extreme
measure of reading the correspondence which
passed through the London Post Office—a policy
which he adopted solely with a view to discover-
view to discovering the leaders of the assassina-
tion party—and his conduct towards Mr. Parnell
was sufficient proof that his discoveries had
not in any way connected that statesman with
the dynamite movement. Finally, it is incon-
ceivable that any ordinarily skilful penman wrote
the signature on which the Times' so called re-
velations are based. Even that journal’s hired
experts decline to swear to the autograph, while
unbiassed authorities are almost unanimous in
[ .declaring it to be a forgery and a sham. The
document is distinctly the work of a compara-
tively uncultured man, and it becomes more than
ever untrustworthy when we remember that it
was brought to light on the very eve of the divi-
sion on the Coercion Bill—the moment above all
others when evidence was wanted to discredit the
Irish patry and aid the Government cause. The
coincidence was, to say the least, suspiciously
opportune ; even the gods who watched over the
battle field before the walls of Troy were not
more timely in their interference.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Compensated” Corpse.
According to the present Australian system of
compensation for damages sustained in railway
accidents, if a bank-manager earning £5OOO a year
is killed, his widow receives, say, £25,000 to con-
sole her for his loss ; while the widow of a clerk
whose salary was £l5O per annum gets, say, £l5OO.
Perhaps some day a system will be introduced by
which men who die or are injured in railway ac-
cidents will be valued according to the amount
which they pay per mile to the Government. Sup-
pose a leading and penurious Q.C. is travelling
second- class, and gets killed as a consequence of
the fact that the youth in charge at Prahran
station happens to be sucking his feeding-bottle
when he should be listening to the tick of the
telegraph, then that Q. O.’s widow gets compensa-
tion based on the lamented dignitary’s average
yearly earnings, iust. precisely as she would had
he been travelling first-class at the time ; while
the widow of the extravagant clerk who dissipated
his £l5O per annum income by paying first-
class fares with the result that his mangled
remains were found beneath a carriage with
morocco upholsteriDg, receives no more than
she would have got had her husband
been killed in the third-class. If compensation
were given in the same proportion as the lo3s sus-
tained, the small-salaried man’s widow ought to
simply because she sustains greater loss, or per-
haps all the loss, in having her bread-winner
taken from her; whereas, in the other case, the
wealth remains. In fact, the wealthy man’s wife
might be a positive gainer by his death. The solid
fact is, however, that the State should give no
pensions, no compensation, no limb-bonuses—“ no
nothink.” The Government should share the re-
sponsibility with the public by the establishment
of a life and accident assurance department—and
no more. Let the carriage of passengers be con-
ducted on purely business principles. Of course
we do not mean to imply that the irresponsible
and criminal negligence of some public companies
is to be imitated Far otherwise. The mere fact
that the Government was the assurer against ac-
cident, as well as the executive carrying power,
would impel it to take every precaution against
accident, and to raise its fares in proportion to the
risk involved. Where criminal neglect could
be proved, let the party or parties culpable be
criminally prosecuted, but put a stop to the system
of granting accident bonuses. It is founded on
no principle of justice or of adequacy to the cases
compensated, and is conductive only to habits of
carelessness on the part of I he public and indifference
to its own responsibilities and interests. At pre j
sent, if a man is killed, no matter by what means,
on the railroad, there is a costly process of litiga-
tion immediately instituted by his friends, to the
benefit of the medical and legal professions and to
the disgrace of the law and the country. An un-
avoidably-broken axle means a setting in motion
of the whole machinery of law with thousands of
pounds expenditure. The only excuse for such
proceedings would be the actual proof of criminal
negligence, which should by departmental or other
enquiry be prima facie established before the case
was brought into a criminal court The precedent
of compensation has been taken advantage of in
every case of railroad accidents for years past,
and the business reflects nothing but discredit of
the Government that allows it.

A Shameless Rag.
Let us give, in double-column form, extracts from
two articles printed in one and the same issue of
the Sydney K. News, politically the meanest and
most unblushing sheet over Sheol—“the friend of
the workman,” and the enemy of the Trades’-Union
the most cowardly, unprincipled, andshamelessly
inconsistent mass of muck which ever attained a
general circulation in a white man's country
“When Queen Victoria's
husband died she thought
fit to retire from the world,
and to a great extent neglect
some of the duties of her
high position for a number of
years ; but herein she com-
pares very unfavourably with
thousands of her country
women, who, with as great a
sorrow at their hearts, heroi-
cally faced the duties and
difficulties of life under cir-
cumstances as adverse to
their happiness as the
Queen’s were favorable. No
doubt royalty covers a multi-
tude of failings, and in one
respect it has served this pur-
pose for Her Majesty. She is
reputed to be the richest
woman in the world, and
there are few men who can
count their fortunes in as
many millions; but curing
the time she has been gather-
ing her store together she has
evinced very little practical
sympathy for the suffering
among her subjects. In for-
mer years she occasionally
contributed small amounts
out of her abundance when-
ever any great calamity
moved the charitable instincts
of the nation: but as she
has grown older she has be-
come more careful, and even
the Bulli disaster could not
induce her to break through
her economic habits. She
telegraphed her sympathy
to ths scores of widows and
hundreds of fatherless chil-
dren that the blast of death
had left to the mercy of the
charitable ; bu’. telegraphic
sympathy was a poor substi-
tute for a helping haul to
clothe the naked and feed the
hungry.”
“And with one grand ac-
claim let the people of this
grand country, this Great
Britain of the future, cry
aloud and shout, with all the
Heaven-ascending power they
can develope, 1 A grand
Amen.’ This is the long-ex-
pected day of days. The
Queen celebrates the Jubilee
of her glorious reign, the
great heart of a luyal people
beats in sympathy with the
matchless m o n a r c h—t h e
Quee-i of Queens. Yes, they
unite in the globe encircling
chorus, and sing ‘ God save
the Queen.' Let the children
in their lisping prattle, let the
jouth in the full-flushed
bloom of buoyant life, let the
happy parents in theii domes
tic spheres, let the old folks
who are tottering to the goal
—in fact, let every one say
‘ Long live the Queen.’ Fifty
years have passed since the
day when that fair young
monarch ascended the throne,
the very pinnacle of human
exaltation, half a century
since she began to sway a
sceptre and wield an in-
fluence more powerful than
those of any other living
potentate. Fif ‘ y years 1 ”
Blow hot, blow cold —that is the way in which
they do the trick. How politically ignorant, care-
less, and brutal must be the populace which
tolerates such effontery! However, this is only on
a par with the conduct of one of the News’ mag-
nates, Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.P., who pulls
the wires in London. When Mr. Heaton went
‘ ’ Home ’ he attached himself for a season to the
retinue of Parnell, and wrote a cheque in aid of
the Irish National cause ; to-day he gives his vote
in the Commons to the purse-proud insolents
who cast the Irish peasant into the snow—and
further, he, the would-be Tory of Tories, pockets
money made by the publication of articles calcu-
lated to make Queen Victoria’s alleged subjects
in Australia go “ home ” and hit her.
A Great Woman-Problem.
Our brain is weary and our locks are thin. We
have been worried past endurance by the perusal
of voluminous correspondence from back-blocks
teachers and Carpentarian subscribers praying for
a solution of that tiger-tale. A glazed eye stares
stolidly upon our “ copy,” and a nerveless hand
directs our pen. And the trouble all comes of the
facetious cowardice of a story-writer who was
afraid to tell the downright truth about lovely
woman. Nearly everybody has read Frank
Stockton's literary connundrum in which he
leaves his readers in a mental fog as to the
fate of the lover of a certain barbaric Princess.
Her lover, a plebeian, had been found guilty by the
kiDg, her father, of the heinous crime of loving the
Princess. His punishment consisted in being
placed alone in the centre of an arena in full view
of an assemblage composed of all the rank, wealth
and beauty of the kingdom. The Princess herself
was there to witness her lover’s fate. At one end
of the enclosure were two dooi'3 which gave ad-
mittance to two apartments. One apartment con ;
tained a tiger ; in the other was the most
beauteous damsel—always excepting the Princess
—the country could boast. If he opened one door
he was torn to pieces. If he opened the other he
was at once wedded, amidst great rejoicings, to a
lovely woman. The Princess alone, of that vast
audience, knew which wa3 the fatal door. Love
and jealousy struggled in her breast. She
had seen her lover previously flirting with
the woman whom a lucky chance might
make his wife. The prisoner had an intuition
that the Princess knew what was in store for him.
His eye sought hers —and here Stockton leaves
us ? Did the jealous Princess give the nod towards
the door which would let loose the tiger upon her
lover, or did the loving Princess magnanimously
indicate the door which hid the bride her rival %
The knotty mystery is still going the rounds, and
the dazed intelligence of humanity is howling fo
a solution. We are resolved it shall howl no
longer. We will unravel the dark and devious
mystery. Stockton’s hesitation is a sop to con-
ventional hypocrisy. He knew that the Princess


the tigress wedding him. No properly-constituted
woman, if she told the brutal truth, would save
her lover's life to surrender him to the arms of
that minx, the other woman Like the ancient
Christians, she would consider the salvation of
his life of little consequence beside the damnation
of his soul. And every woman regards a man’s
affection for every other woman than herself as
little short of damnation. Better that he should
die in the true faith—far better. And die he did,
although Stockton - is too mean to say so. The
“ Lady and the Tiger ” is always looked upon by
every lady as a case of “ The Gentleman and the
Tigress.” There, now !
A Stand-up Fight
For the vacancy in the Council of Melbourne
University, occasioned by Dr. Leeper’s resignaj
tion, there are two candidates, viz., the Right
Reverend Dr. Field Flowers Goe, “ Lord
Bishop of Melbourne,” and Mr. James Lambie,
M.A., of the Argus, The fame of the episcopal
Goliath has been noised abroad throughout the
length and breadth of the Australian continent
He is a mighty man of valour, before whose vast
ecclesiastical stature the serried ranks of unbelief
shrink aghast; and at whose evangelical Ha! Ha!
the heterodox call upon the rocks to cover them
and the caverns to hide them, Mr. Lambie, who
represents the David of this encounter, was for-
merly a Presbyterian clergyman, but, chaing
at the extremely rigid tenets of Calvinism
as interpreted by the Melbourne Presby-
tery, he has abandoned the pulpit for the
press. His articles on the Melbourne churches,
now appearing in the Argus, show how com-
pletely he has divested himself of the Geneva
gown. The Sydney people who remember Mr.
Greenwood some years ago will have a pretty
accurate notion of Mr. Lambie’s style. As an ad
eundem graduate of Melbourne, Mr. Lambie has
taken an active part in the debates of the Senate,
and he has been nominated for a seat in the
Council by the Liberals of that body. It will,
perhaps, be the most closely contested election
ever held in connection with the University of
Melbourne ; and the result will go far to decide
a question which has divided the Senate into
two opposing factions. Ever since the Univer-
sity was founded, professors, schoolmasters,
and the heads of the affiliated theological
colleges have commanded a majority in
the Council ; and it is naturally the wish
of the Conservative graduates that this state
of things should not be disturbed. The Liberals
and Radicals desire, on the other hand, however,
that the members of the Executive should have
no pecuniary interest whatever in the students,
and they a e determined to return men to the
Council who have no end to serve but the welfare
of the University. The Anglican Bishop of Mel-
bourne, as the theological head of Trinity College,
has therefore been appropriately nominated by
the Tories, while the party of progress—native-
born Australians for the most part—have, with
equal propriety, put forward ” a gentleman’ of no
denomination at all,” as Mr. Lambie is contemp-
tuously termed by the Rev. Canon Stretch,
Chairman of Mr. Goe's committee. Whether the
Scriptural parallel with which we started will be
rendered complete by Mr. Lambie’s victory and
the Bishop’s defeat abides the issue.

Newspaper Privilege.
The Times and tho Unionist party in Britain
have started an entirely novel theory touching
the privileges of the Press. Ic is claimed by them
that merely because a public man is libelled
by a threepenny newspaper he is bound
to clear his character in a court of jus-
tice. His plea of not guilty enounced in
Parliament, according to these authorities, is
worthless. He is accused of a crime, and the onus
lies upon him of proving his innocence 1 The bill
of indictment is not drawn up with the intent to
make this always onerous task very simple. Yet
he must engage in it forthwith, or forever wander
about the earth with a damned character and a
wretched sense of criminality 1 The Times avers
so much, and Lord Salisbury and his lieutenants
re-echo the cry. But surely the men who argue
thus must be bereft of reason. All that Parnell
was called upon to do in respect of the publication
of a letter alleged to have passed between him and
somebody else relative to the Phcenix Park mur-
ders, was to immediately deny the authenticity of
the document, and repudiate all knowledge of it.
This he did. To say that he is required to insti-
tute proceedings against the Times, or any other
paper or individual, in order to clear his reputa-
tion, is to argue that the process by which justice
is ordinarily secured should be inverted simply to
serve the political exigencies of the hour
or rather of The Times. Nothing is easier
than for a party paper to concoct a blast-
ing libel on a public man and make capital out of
his refusal to spend a fortune in briefing
lawyeis. If the Unionists' theory of this
matter is correct, then a new terror is created
infinitely more destructive of human liberty than
mere personal despotism. A despotic Czar may
be combatted ; but a despotic Press would bs an
invulnerable entity. The thing could not be
gotten at in any way whatsoever. Yet
it is such an intolerable destroyer of liberty
that the Unionists have conjursd into being
with the view of crushing the Irish party. Even
if Parnell could have the venue changed from
England to Ireland— where at all events he might
possibly get a fairer trial, from his point of view,
than in London—he would simply place his head
in the lion’s mouth by accepting the challenge of
an irresponsible corporation to get into the wit-
ness-box and have every secret of his life, how-
ever irielevant to the issue, wrenched from him in
open court to make a Tory hpliday. He is dared
to place hinitolf at the mercy - of an English special
jury, at whose hands, in all probability, he would be
accorded a short shrift and no mercy. The idea
that he is bound to bring an action is absurd from
another point of view. As an honourable man he
may have reason to regard the Times merely as a
venal hueling rag, and to consider himself far
above any reflections which it may make upon his
character. Suppose, for example, such a man
as Chief Justice Higinbotiiam were falsely ac-
cused of corruption by, say, the Police News
couul he not fittingly ignore the libel l Yet ac-’
cording to the Salisbury gang’s hypothesis he
would, by holding his calumniators in contempt,
admit his guilt! As an authority on Irish affairs
The Times is joered at by both sides in the
Commons. We assert that, for the purposes of each
special case, the man accused, if secure in the
consciousness of his own rectitude, may hold himself
to be the best judge of how his character is likely
to be affected by the paper or the person that may
malign him.
The justice of a short Bulletin article on the
toady tendency of last Eight Hours’ demonstration
in Melbourne, was impugned by a Democrat writ-
ing from the scene of action. Our correspondent
stated that only two of the trades’ bands blew off
their loyally in the form of “ God Save the Queen,”
MR. THOMAS B. ROBERTS,
Editor of the Gunnedah (N.S.W.) ADVERTISER.
and not more than 50 people cheered H.E. the
Governor. It must have been one of the admitted
50 who recently wrote to the Melbourne Herald,
pleading “ that working men might have the
opportunity of paying their respects to His Excel-
lency,” at the Jubilee Levee. This flabby, free and
independent toiler a9ks but for a removal of the
“evening dress” restriction, and kind permission
to pay those respects of his in Sunday clothes. It
is hard that a claw-hammer coat should come be-
tween a human being and bliss unspeakable, but
we think the horny-handed courtier ought to
stand down until he can borrow the regulation
toga. Evening dress at a levee is the outward
visible sign of the inward spiritual grovel—the
tomfoolish badge of every wearer’s degradation.
That Australian Commissioner who attended
Princess Louise’s garden struggle in a pot-hat
was justly ridiculed, for the reason that he
affected to play a manly part in a game which he
knew to be hollow and contemptible. We excuse
the Melbourne working man who would a-booing
go, on the grounds that he neither understands
“loyalty,” nor is aware of the fact that he is a
snob at heart. “Loyalty,” as worked at levees,
drawing-rooms, and royal pageants, is a sham ex-
pression of belief in a sham institution. If we
stripped these sickly functions of their frippery
they would soon take a chill and die. Hence it is
that born Tories are the most watchful sticklers
for Court etiquette and official custom, while born
toadies encourage their efforts. When the Queen
puts a crown on her head, symbolical of a claim
to natural superiority, she only receives her sub-
jects— pagh ! —on condition that they keep up the
imposture by rigging themselves out in masquer-
ade costume. And when Sir Henry Locii poses
as deputy-monarch of Victoria he requires that
his deputy subject-visitors shall lay bare a wide
expanse of shirt-front. Do they not all enter into
the spirit of the farce? Are not the C.M.G.’s,
who have licked the royal knuckles, longing to
appear at Government House in Court dress “just
as a mark of respect ” ? They are, they are, they
know they are. When our working man friend
asks to be admitted to Loch’s Jubilee Levee in
ordinary clothes, he is like one wishing to attend
a bal masque without a domino. We have no
pity for that individual He wants to be a Court
fool—without wearing the cap and bells ; an ass-
in a lion’s skin ; a worm —in the everyday clothing
of a real man. If the necessary cost of war-paint
prevents the dunder-headed savage from “ paying
his respects to His Excellency ” on Jubilee Day,
let him—if he is a real personage—forget his
Queen and be thankful. But we have grave
doubts about the genuineness of that working
man’s letter. It is probably a delusion and a
snare. Another damnable device of the Tory
enemy.
The Argus celebrated Queen’s Birthday with a
leading article so be9meate 1 with greasy grovel
that the very sight of it would turn the stomach
of a C.M.G., and rouse the indignation of a worm.
The Jeames who did the work seems to have re-
ceived instructions to beslaver all royalty since
Solomon, but lack of memoranda prevented him
from reaching further back than “the Virgin
Queen.” “The Queen.” sail Jeames, “ unlik
her virgin (!!) predecessor, shirked no portion of
her birthright of duty, but, obeying the proper
instincts of womanhood, chose a husband.” She
did, Jeames : she married poor Albert by main
force, to the disgust of all her advisers; after
which she “obeyed the &c ” by having a family
of nine. All very right and proper—but nothing
to gush about. Our washerwoman didn’t shur
her birthright of duty, and her family is increasing
every year. Jeames also observes that “all the
millions of her subjects conspire to call her
blessed.” So they do, Jeames. The native Indian
soldiery, waiting until the hour is ripe for another
mutiny—the Irish peasantry—the Scotch crofters
—the Welsh who have howled down all Jubilee
spouters—the Londoners who go to church to
hiss prayers for the Qaeen —the followers of th-j
murdered Riel —the kidnapped Burmese—thesub-
jects of the abducted Cetewayo—all these conspire
tocall her “blessed.” Afterluggingin “thatmartyr,
the Princess Alice,” and that “noble woman, the
Crown Princess of Germany,” the Argus
‘ Jeames ” says “ there is no necessity for any
fulsome adulation in dealing with the womanhood,
motherhood, or queenship of Victoria.” Great
Scott! If this Birthday article is to be accepted as
a plain cold statement of facts, what may we ex-
pect from Jeames on Jubilee Day !!
A lovely item per cable :
‘‘London, May 21—The recently-floated company, the
Caledonian and Australian Mortgage and Agency Company,
the object of which is to advance money for investment in
colonial city property, has cabled £350,000 for investment in
freeholds in Melbourne and Sydney.”
In Sydney alone a large portion of the rents are
collected by the agents of aristocratic and absen-
tee landlords and forwarded to England. If we
cannot have land nationalisation, for Heaven’s
sake let us part with our land only to residents in
the colonies. The lack of an absentee-tax is an
invitation to the investment of blood-sucking
foreign capital. The only way in which we can
prevent it is an ad valorem ground rent-tax on all
lands held by non-resident speculators. The sys-
tem into which we are drifting has ruined Ireland
and is at present an active curse in America

The Escaped Nun,” with her collecting-plate,
the Jubilee cadge, and the recently-sloped monk
who raises funds by Protestant lectures delivered
under the auspices of an Orange lodge, take a
back seat. The Town and Country Journal
has put on its block-tin halo, and the following
delicate literary blossom, regarded as a maiden
effort to raise the wind, wipes out anything and
everything yet recorded in the annals of men-
dicancy:—

The editor—poor devil—has nothing to do with

to raise sympathy on his bshalf, and the wealthy
proprietary publish begging letters so that they
may get their columns filled gratis instead of pay-
ing for contributions as their contemporaries are
content to do. In the art of harrowing the field
of human sympathy, Alfred has really only one

E J. A. Haynes, L.It.C.P., writes to the Sydney
D.T on the subject of certificates of djath. He
says:—
"I pity any medical man trying to ir vestigate diseases
peculiar to Ndi. W. if he consults the jumble to be fouud in
the Registrar-General s statistics, which have been comDi.ed
from the death certificates of quacks, Chinamen, heffi to
market-gardeners, and undertakers." ’
This is good, so far as it goes, but Dr. Haynes has
not yet got a full grip of his subject. He has left
monthly-nurses out of his list, and druggists’
apple-cheeked apprentices, also tram-conductors
niggers, abortionists, obliging next door-neigh-
bours, and asylum warders who kick paralysed
imbeciles to death. When he studies the matter
a little further, he will find that anything short of
a dead body is gcod enough to sign a death-certi-
ficate in NS. W. , and there is really no reason
why a murderer who cares to add M.D. to his
own name should not supply the necessary guaran-
tee that his own home-made corpse was carried off
by " natural causes." Still, we don’t see why Dr.
Hay n es should want to disturb t lie existing order of
things. It suits everybody but the deceased, and
so long as he does not complain it seems obtrusive
for a perfect stranger to interfere with the private
business of another man’s remains.
When PARKis desires not to commit himself he
generally retires under cover of a host of battared
and ill-used pronouns, and even when he endea-
\ours to be explicit—if he ever did make such an
endeavour— his old habit is too strong for him,
and he is as vagne asamorphiomaniac in aLondon
fog. The following are two specimens of his
bloodthirsty encounters with sundry parts of
speech which don’t express anything after all

It is a wise relative that knows its own antece-
dent, ard unless Parkes is altogether debarred
the use of pronouns the public documents of New
South Wains will soon degenerate in f o crypto*
grapiis. Lady Carington gave away the syntax
whicn she had learned in the marble halls of her
ancestors badly enough when she raised the sub-
ject of “ pre-emin*nc9 in grief, ’ but even she is
not a patch on Parkek when he wad*s in in real
earnest.
It has besn unanimously resolved that the London
Common Council has not been guilfy of misappro-
priation of the public funds, after all. That is to
aay, it has been resolved that the Aldermen did
spend £20,000 of ratepayers’ money in hiring
gangs of prize-fighters, loafers, rowdies, coal-
heavers, faith-healers, sandwich men, &c , to
break up public meetings held in the cause of
municipal reform, and in paying men to get up
bogus gatherings in support of the old order of
government, but this, it seems, is not misappro-
priation. Another item from the lying and white-
wash department reports that the British bayonet
proves, on further examination, to be even worse
than was imagined. A truss of straw, with some
cotton-waste in the middle, was used to experi-
ment upon, and seveial hundred bayomets were
bent double in attacls upon it, while the truss
was not damaged. It has been decided, however,
tnat though weapons of this sort have been
passed by all the officials concerned for 20 years
and more, they were not bribed to accept the rub-
bish—they weie merely filled with auch ghastly
ignorance that they didn’t know any better. Jn
other words, the verdict is that everybody con-
nected with the business for the last 20 years and
een a the meanest description,
and hasn t had brains enough to be a rogue. Even
i v v entot Won t go into battle with a cracked
club, but then the British army is not so lucky as
to be bossed by a Hottentot. No wonder that
when Great Britain goes to war now a days, even
against a mere pack of niggers, she gets pretty
well tied up every time.
John Haynes, M.L.A., has started to cultivate
the flowers of speech in his mental back yard. In
an article on the beauties of Mudgee he describes
Gapertee \ alley as “the sunken palm of Provi-
dence. and then he goes calmly on witnout stop-
ping to remark : “ This is poetry.” When next we
look upon a rocky ridge we will know, on the same
principle, that we are gazing on the broken front

Mr. Clarke, the New South Wales Minister of
Justice, is investigating the case of the Mount
Rennie prisoners now in gaol, who, he is alleged
to believe, are entitled to leniency, if not to abso-
lute acquittal. If he likes to carry his investiga-
tions far enough he will discover quite a lot of
things in this matter. He will probably fli d,
for instance, that Windkyer is utterly unfit to
be a Judge, and should at once be replaced by
someone who does not adjourn great criminal
trials in order that he may be enabled to dine with
the aristocracy. He will ascertain that Caring-
ton was built to be a sm<»ll showman or a bazaar-
opener, or anylhing of that kind rather than to be
the arbiter of life or dea»h in the case of British
citizens convicted after a so-called trial which
was a disgrace to the civilised world. If he goes
on a little further he may find out a lot more.
Perhaps he may even drop on to the fact that
Sweetman was sentenced to 14 years and two
floggings for doing what at least one hulkiDg
member of Parliament does a’most every week;
and if he keeps at it after this he may learn that a
swell Sydney merchant, who never gets flogged or
even prosecuted, can manage to be a lot werse
than a cabman without trying very hard, either.
In short, there is hardly any end to the things
Clakke may learn before his investigation is

What Australia owes to the “dear” old mother

from a letter to the Pall Mall Gazette penned by

The attached portrait represents Mr. Thomas B.
Roberts, editor and proprietor of the Gannedah
.(N.S.W.) Advertiser, a gentleman from whom
Mr. J P. Abbott lately wanted to recover £lOOO
damages for alhged libel. He was born in Liver-
pool (EDg.) in 1841, and arrived in N.S.W. at the
age of 10. He learn d the business of a compos!
tor under the late Mr. Walsh, of Bell’s Life in
Sydney, and in 1860 joined the staff of the Mait-
land Ensign, then just born, now deal, and past
all resurrection. His next position was in the
office of the Illawarra Mekcury, and thence
he removed to the Southern Telegraph, Bom-
bala. The Monaro Star afforded him another
sphere of usefulness, and on leaving it he became
foreman of the Kiama Independent, where he
remained 10 years. He afterwards managed the
Namoi Independent, and finally, in December,
1881, started the Gunnedah (V.S.W.) Adver-
tiser, which he has succeeded in miking a very
profitable venture. His staff consists of his three
sons, and, with the exception of Mr. J. P. Abbott,
he has now no annoyances worth speaking of.
Mr. Martin J. Little.
Mr. Martin J. Little, editor of the Ipswich (Q )
Advocate, was bcrn at Ipswich in June 1864, and
spent his eady life in that prosperous little town.
He was educated at St. Mary’s Seminary there,
and afterwards entered the Education Department
as a teacher. Twelve months’ experience of thi9
drudgery, however, convinced him lhat expound-
ing to shock-headed boys the mysteries of the
irregular verbs was not his forte and he joined
the staff of the Advocate, then in its early in-
fancy. Here he acted for six years as reporter,
and at the beginning of the present year found
himself promoted to the editoiial chair, which he
has filled with marked success. Mr. Little’s bio-
graphy is a short one, but then—notwithstanding
the position he has attained—he is only 23, and
has not yet had time to make history.
Mr. “Joe” Bennett, who has long been

From the Sydney Globe : “ Foster, Peid,

stager who resigned the Attorney-Generalship
because of its companionship, and the other old
stagers who would not have it for a similar rea-
son, are going to do a howl of eulogy over the
youngster who was green enough to take it.” If
Wise gets in, the first measure he proposes to
introduce is one ‘‘for the proper housing of the
poor.” Freetrade has always dragged N.S.W.
down to pauperism and poor-houses, and Mr. B.
R, Wise, recognising this fact, is going to rise to
the occasion. Parkes has already 5000 men on
hand whom his favourite policy has reduced to
beggary, and they want housing badly,

“Little Jack Sheppard,” who is urged on
his wild career by the ten-horse power of Brough
and Boucicault’B burlesque company, opened last
Saturday at Sydney Royal in the presence of a
dense, wet, enthusiastic crowd, which heaved
and steamed like a whole forest of blue-moulded
umbrellas. Public opinion—represented, as usual
by the bald-headed man who sits at the back of
the omnibus—has already resolved that this piece
is to be a success. It is the wildest, jumpiest, and
most extravagant of comic operas, filled with
thieves, who cadge more recklessly, and come
home with a larger s ock of stolen food bidden
in their hats than any other thieves on record, and
crammed with humoursome turglai-3 who break
into banks to slow music. Iteontains more pretty
girls in boys’ clothes that
we ever saw before, and
these girls think nothing
of fighting, armed only
with a raw chicken and
a few herbs, against fero-
cious bandits with clubs
end artillery. There are
more dancing assassins
in it than in any other
opera we have heard of
this year, and they jump
higher, and stay up
longer, and howl louder,
and flop down again
more suddenly, and drink
more, and fall longer
distances out of more
windows on top of a
larger number of mys-
terious conspirators than
they do in any other
pii c?, and the conspira-
tors look more surprised,
and are squashed flatter
when they are fallen
upon, than any others
known to history Fully
twice as many things
happen in barely half as
much time a 3 usual, and
in the exciting passages
the Jacobites, Janissa-
ries, bridesmaids, troops,
and singing burglars are
all mixed together in
Btacks. Mis 3 Fanny
Ilobina, as Jack, makes
a frisky little ciiminal,
and reads The Bulletin
in gaol in the last act.
Mr. Robert Brough does
Jonathan Wild in splen-
did style, and dances like
a greased spider on a hot
stove. Mr. Roycs fills
the part of Blueskin, and
not only fills it, but
hangs over at the sides ;
Miss Florence Harcourt
makes a dainty figure as
Thames Darrell, and Mr.

“ The Outcasts,” which is booming at
Sydney Royal Standard, is adapted from Miss
Brad don’s parabolic cram “ Henry Dnnbar,” and
i 3, ia several respects, more acceptable than the
or ginul novel. The mystery which the authoress
drags through the howling wilderness of a three
volume novel is condensed a lot and gains in
simultaneous continuousness by the process.
The wicked banker and his v dim a e still
there, but the sufferings of the fcimsr are cut
short, and he has not even time to leave a hen-
track on the shores of the great ocean of time
before he is concussed by the billows and dragged
down to meet his fate. From this point Dunbar
and Wilmot are mixed up like twin infants in a
wash tub, and the latter has to spend all his time
in dodging his own daughter rvho thinks he is the
other man, and accuses him of having murdered
himself and hid the body. A man in such a posi-
tion as I his is apt to have a woefully had time of
it. When the yearning girl comes in at the door
he has to escape by the window ; when she is sit-
ting on the table waiting for his arrival he can’t
possibly come out from underneath for fear of
being seen, and when she slides down on one side
he has to rise on the other like a tissue paper ghost
crawling out of a tomb. If she carries her investi-
gations underneath it is then time for him to get on
top, and when a breathless messenger informs him
that she is stuck in the chimney he can’t, without
challenging utter ruin, sit on the hob, but must
go and double himself up in the fowl-house. Life,
under circumstances like these, is hardly worth
having, and it is all in vain that the miserable
victim sends cheques to the infuriated girl, per
favour of the cashier with the bald spot on the
back of his head, tor the documents are torn up
and the pieces sent back in derision. The story is
too painful to pursue further, but it is well worked
out and well played. Mr. H. C. Sidney, as the
sham Dunbar, scored a triumph, and Mr. Booth
man ro e above his usual level in tie second
secne, where he dumps down a thin, underfed cash-
box and resigns his billet. Miss Alice Norton
and Miss Ada Roehfiort represented two very nice
young ladies, and Mr. Leston made a sort of a
success in a oomedy part as the “ Major ” gone to
seed. The rest of the eaet was—was—ahem—it

A very respectable crowd managed to keep
dry in Sydney Academy on Monday, and amused
themselves with “ Queen’s Evidence.” Mr Vivian
had a congenial part in Jonas Isaacs, and he rose
to the occasion as he generally does under such
circumstances, and as he rose the house came
down. He brought it down. Miss Helen Vivian,
in the character of Kate Medland, was a three-
pint lady wrestling with a five-quart part, but she
being blind, perhaps the other characters
took a mean advantage of her. Mr. Hesford
attempted to represent a meek Pecksniff from a
ladies’ seminary, he only succeeded in looking
like an unshaved bird of prey which had laid in a
quart of beer and some oysters and didn’t mean to
go home till morning. His voice required to be
eiiher greased or buried, for it sounded like a ton
of coals being delivered in the back yard. Per-
haps he had a cold. Misses Amy Nelson and
Edith Thorne might easily have been worse ; so
might the scenery. Mr. Samuell —who, by the
way, got rather damp on Monday while looking
after things at the front door—is “at home’'at
the Academy every Sunday night accompanied by
20 lady vocalists, and one more thorn is thus
planted in Fastor Jefferis’ flesh.

A bit of Italian opera criticism :
“ Signor Pimazzoni made a don whom no one would sup-
pose capable of ruining many women. He lacked vigour,
and was altogether too modest for the character. He re-
ceived the only encore of the • vening for his rendering of the
Canzonnetta, ‘ From out thy casement glancing,’ which he
sang to a mandoline a companiment, played by the strings
pizzicato, and which by no m-ans accorded so well with the
singer’s voice as the music would have done had it been
played with the bow.”
By Jove ! Of course it is all from the Sydney E.
News.

The Majeronis started their season at
Melbourne Bijou on Saturday, with five acts of
emotion adapted from Ouida's nasty novel
“ Wanda.” Mr. George Leitch Walker has faked
up a fairly understandable story from unhealthy
material, but the slimy trail of Ouida’s vicious
snobbism meanders over the whole play. It is a
nauseous glorification of “ noble birth” written in
the interests of jubilee promoters and the Slave
trade.. His Imperial Thingummy the Czar must
run over and see “ Wanda," If he can dodge the
dynamite of his faithful subjects. It slops over
with sentiment calculated to make emperors
weep and honest men swear. The plot goes
something after this style. Wanda, a holy, high-
born female, proposes to, and marries a soi-disant
French marquis, because she preferred him .to a
Russian Prince Vasharly with a noble eoui, or
what passes for a noble soul—in Russia. It ap-
pears that the French marquis is really an illegiti-
mate son of some other Prince by a beautiful serf
girl. As a boy he had been twitted on his ‘ ‘ base”
origin by the noble Vasharly, and the noble
Vasharly stuck a knife into him for being so
“ damned low.” By the scar of this kaife thrust
Vasharly recognises the Marquis in after years,
but for Wanda’s sake he doesn’t tell her what an
“ inferior pusson ” the is living with. Countess
Olga Brancha—a married lady who is always
smackiDg her Hindoo manservant in the eye when
she isn’t playing the role of Potiphar’s Wife—de-
nounces the Marquis as a serf, because he (having
inherited virtue from his maligned mother) won’t
hug the Countess when she asks him. On
the strength of this disclosure Wanda drive, s
about her noble family and the tainted
blood of her offspring, and orders the loving hus-
band to clear out. For ten years she has been
married to her beau ideal of mankind, only to
flndthathe is “ bate born” after all. This is
very affecting. It is also very rough on the sas-
siety doctrine that blood will tell. For the next
three years the poor chucked-out Marquis freezes
on a snowy muuntain park close handy. Then
his wife forgives his accident of birth and tako3
him home to thaw as the curtain falls Two
clever children, Edith and Mabel Appleton, are
the freshest and nicest features of the show. The
Hindoo servant who serves as punching-machine
for Countess Olga is also an amusing cuss. He
never says anything, but his eye rolls in fine
frenzy when Miss Lucia Harwood lands him below
the belt. That lady plays the seductive Countess
creditably, and certainly wins sympa hy by show-
ing that anyway she isn’t a stickler for “ birth ”
where her affections are concerned. Mr. H. R.
Jewett fails to make the noble-souled Prince
Vasharly anything but a cowardly cur, which
isn’t his fault. The Wanda of Signora Majeroni
is a powerful performance in a bad cause—as
much mly be said of the Signor. But it is a
public misfortune that two talented artists should
waste their taleat on a p ay with no other pur-
pose than to palm off snobbery as virtue. I here
is beautiful scenery in “ Wanda ” and one great
situation. The Majeronis’ well-earned reputation
will ensure a decent run,

Her Gracious Majesty had a birthday (by
the grace of God) last week, which prevented us
from publishing a gorgeous notice of “ A Night
Off,” at Melbourne Princess's. The Triumvirate
will respect this delay, for they dearly love the
Queen and all who are set in authority over us.
A Vice-Regal command receives their most obse-
quious attention. We have detected a distinct
tremor in the voice of Mr. Williamson when
speaking of Sir Henry Loeh. He called him
“ the worthy Governor,” even as a dutiful son re-
ferreth to the “old man.” This overture con-
cluded, it only remains for us to say that “A
Night Off” is an ultra funny comedy in four
screams, of which the first scream is only a mild
prelude to the last three. The thing is so studded
with points that the boldest critic couldn’t sit on
it if he would. In the principal male characters,
Messrs. Anson, Maltby, Titheradge, and Hans
Phillips shine like a schoolboy’s morning face,
while among the ladies Mesdames Agnes Thomas,
Jenny Watt-Tanner, and Annie Taylor are about
as good as they are beautiful. The very best joke of
the comedy is wrapped up in its last line, and deli-
vered when many of the audience are bolting off
to catch a train. They are wrong there. A joke
is a joy for ever. A train may be overtaken by
the Brighton express. Our first notice contained
more butter than this, but butter won’t keep
fresh for a second week.

the Opera House, and “Alone in London” gets
better instead of getting worse. “ Silk Stockings ”
are still in good demand. Mr. Tommy Hudson
has floated his Surprise Company at St. George’s
Hall, and shares (two shillings paid up at the
door) are freely enquired after. Things, however,
have not gone altogether smoothly on the Mel-
bourne “variety ” market. One broker, Walter
Cottier, retired from business all of a suddint last
week leaving his Jubilee minßtrels and his fairy
circle of ladies in teai'3 and arrears. Then
there was a distressing law-suit between Horace '
Bent and Charles Huso. Horace claimed a week’s
wages for illegal dismissal from the Buffaloes
since departed for other prairies. Horace denied the
wet impeachment urged against him by Hugo and
murmured, “Bent, but not broke,” as he skipped
out of the Halls of Justice with an order for £B.
The only and inimitable one has now joined
Frank Clark’s crowd, and the “ Stockings ” are
quoted firmer than ever.

At the Alexandra things are looking
gloomy for “ The Little Dude.” There is an air
of thinness about this show. The lady performers’
voices are as thin as themselves. Dresses are thin
to suit the wearers. Audiences are ghastly thin.
Onee landed in the circle a fellow feels himself to
be out of humanity’s reach, and a cold, Robinsen-
Crusoe sort of feeling runs down his spine. Cumie
opera, taken under these conditions, incites t»
suicide and deeds of blood. There is more little-
ness than Dude about MLs Marion Norman in the
name part, while the other ladies look as though
they ought to be allowed to grow and thicken out
for another conple of years. Two gentlemen
figure in the bill. They might die togetner and be
buried in the same grave. The management is
thinking of putting up another opera shortly, but
unless it puts up another company and some more
etceteras there is reason to fear the w-orst. By the
way, Mdlle. Franzini, the lady bicyclist, has been
wedged in among the other attractions. A wrest-
ling match or alsix-days’ go-as-you-please might
mate this opera season hum.


PEPPER

Premier Gillies, one of the staunchest
Tories that ever gave a penny tip, will not allow
any Radical notions to interfere with the spon-
taneous and representative character of Jubilee
illuminations in Victoria. The public must re-
joice at the public expense, and that’s all about
it. Don’t tell us that ratepayers in the various
boroughs are preparing to bring actions against
the Councils for improper application of borough
funds. They can’t stop it. The robbery has been
too carefully planned. Knowing what a frenzied
longing there is for Jubilee fireworks and bun
festivals, knowing how widespread is the Vic-
torian desire to worship the Queen and magnify
her name at any cost, confident that every man in
the colony would shed his last shilling for Jubilee
if he were consulted in the matter —proud and
happy in the knowledge, Gillies privately arranged
with the Melbourne City Council that if any rate-
payer should object “ he will have no hesitation
in at once bringing a bill before Parliament to
legalise the expenditure of municipal funds on
the Jubilee celebration ” —
The physiologist and zoologist who fur-
nishes the powerful “As you like it” papers to
the S.M. Herald, speaks of the “passionate love
of fatherland which distinguishes civilised man
from beasts.” This distinction does not hold good.
We have a bull-pup—a truculent beauty with
milk-white skin and bloodshot eyes—that, after
being presented to a friend ten miles off, has re-
turned to his “fatherland” in our back-yard no
less than five times. So, too, when we were lately
shifting, we couldn’t manage to induce our tom-
cat to forsake his native chimney-stack, or tear
himself away from the corrugated-iron roof of his
infancy.
Alfred Deakin has written to a friend in
Melbourne, saying: “I am very eager to get
back, and with all the wealth, power, and intel-
lectual culture of this country I would not change
my home if I could.” Exactly! This is the
first time the perky young rooster has quitted his
own dunghill. Let us sing a little song of
sympathy to Alfred, and pray that the gentle
zephyr will waft it to him o’er the waters blue.
Now that a single consultationist, from among
the consultationists innumerable of N.S.W., has
been fined in a small sum, the official fly in the
glue-pot seems to have stopped for a rest. No at-
tempt whatever has bsen made to harass the
other promoters of sweeps, and the word-compe-
tition men, the Jubilee party who wants his
readers to forward a shilling and And out if they
were both born on the same day “ and if so will
send a pound,’’—the quack-doctor, the herbal fraud,
and the eminent lawyer, who makes illegal charges
for writing bullying letters, are all still on the
loose. So, too, are the hundred and fifty land-
syndicates bossed by members of Parliament, who
trade off malarious swamps—auctioned in the dry
season —with a small deposit and very small
monthly payments, and who, when their victims
have been killed off with fever on poisonous
“estates” sold under false pretences, foreclose
on the widow’s allotment and quite forget
to return any part of the money already
paid. The promoters of several such socie-
ties which, in spite of flowing balance sheets,
have gone dry, are also walking about at large,
and the men who want Smith to send two half-
crowns with a view to finding out if there is not a
legacy of £2,000,000 awaiting him, pursue the
even tenor of their little swindle. Sundry faith-
healers, with a cure that’s all my eye, are also
bound this way with a view to taking in the
guineas of the blind and the paralytic, and will
doubtless do a good business without disturbance,
and the eminent Chinese merchant continues to
run his fan-tan establishment as of old, and his
underling, as he looks out of the door to make
sure that the well-tipped policeman is not about to
turn dog on the institution, observes rightly that
“white man one climson fool.” In view of all
these things it seems strange that the authorities
of Sydney should sit down to rest after a long shot
at one poor, mean, little consultation.
“ Brevity ” from the Sydney E. News :
“ There is a prospect that Oscar Wilde will visit
Australia. He will teach us ‘ cultchaw.* ” Dear

HE HAD HER THERE.
HE (a well-seasoned taper): “HEBE, MY DEAR, WHAT IS THE SMALLEST THING IN

PENN'ORTH OF YOUR BRANDY.” (But she didn't take the hint).
himself, but this is actually what a French count
done. He called on a wealthy baron early
one morning, and agreed to rent his mansion. He
v anted particularly to know if the bath worked
well, and the baron got out of bed and into the
tub to show that it was all right. Then the count
took his clothes and his pocket-book and fled,
locking the door behind him, and the dripping and
unclad baron skipped through the window and
gave chase. He was seized as a lunatic, however,
before he had gone ten yards, and when the agile
count was captured some months afterwards he
had spent all the money, and, being dead-broke,
was just beginning a new career as a Protestant
convert who was persecuted by the Mudgoe Pi o-
tectioDist electors on account of his religious con-
victions.
Mr. Justice Stephen, of N.S.W., at his
swearing-in, quoted Lord Bacon as saying that
“ an ever-speaking Judge is no well-tuned cymbal.”
A few years ago there was a Justice Stephen in
Victoria, who was emphatically “an ever-speak-
ing judge." He was a relative of the present
Judge Stephen, by the way, and in his general
style reminded one of a “well-bred" old maid.
He was eternally saying malapropos things from
the Bench. One day, sitting in Banco with the
Hibernian Stawell and the Cork Barry, he volun-
teered the opinion that Irish intellect could never
compete with the English article. Stawell looked
down at Dick Ireland, Billing, and Higinbotham
(all Milesians), and slightly curled his uoper-lip,
while Sir Redmond began to search vigorously for
some papers he had mislaid. The great success of
“ dear old Molesworth ” on the bench was the fact
that he never interrupted counsel, even the
rawest junior, but heard all he had to say, to the
bitter end.

Poor slaves who pay the rates,
Hear what Duncan Gillies spates—
When a Council jubilates
In fashion regal,
’Tis absurd to tear your hair,
You had better grin and bear,
Or a Bill he wiil prepare
To make it legal.
Poor slaves who pay the rat»s,
J’rithee, thank your lucky fatos
That a mayor illuminates
Although you wouldn’t;
When you see devices flash,
Purchased with the public cash,
Never murmur “ dem,” or “ dash ’’ —
Oh ! you shouldn’t.
Poor slavos who pay the rates,
Fix this fact inside your pate 3—
Tis the Law that obligates
Rejoicings “loyal ; ”

To our way of thinking, it
Is a swindle meet and fit —
Completely Royal.

And though Tory syndicates
Rob and plunder.
Freedom soon shall raise her voice,
And yourselves shall make the choice

You found that in this world so wide
Are wider men than even Deakin.

You are, in common way of speakin’—
Bat quit our shores and then, Oh dear !
No more are you a Triton, Deakin.
When walking London streets you grew
Your speech and manner very raeelc in—
How few among those millions knew
There was a man named Alfred Deakin !
And every day you stay abroad
You find your cap of glory leakin’ ;
Come back and be again adored—
Again Chief Secretary Deakin.
Return, O Young Victoria’s boast!
The banqueteer shall dip his beak in
The festive glass, and drink this toast —
“ Long live our one and only Deakin ! ”

Mark Twain is still a humorist. At a

coming law in tte forthcoming session, which
ought to bs a memorable one in the history of the
farinaceous colony, inasmuch as it is likely to in-
augurate two popular and progressive m r asures—
Protection to native industries and payment of
members.
Here is a prediction ! If Mr. Wise is
vigorously opposed for South Sydney the N.S.W.
Government will a'tempt to bribe the tobacco-
workers, the majority of whom reside in that part
of the city, by announcing that they will not pro-
ceed with the proposed increased excise duty on
tobacco. A petition signed by over 30,000 resi-
dents of South Sydney in opposition to the duty
was recently presented to Parliament. The Free-
trade banner has been hauled down several times
already, and will no doubt be dipped again when
it will convenience the Pro-trade-free-lection
Government to do so. W e challenge Parkes to
stand to his guns.
Thadeus o‘Kane, of the Northern Miner,
has got a firm grip of solid fact“ Australia is to
be in future under petticoat Government. It is
to be ruled from the Prince ef Wales’ drawing
room. A coterie o£ his lady friends, governors’
wives, and such small celebrities are to square
the colonists. l ady Loch has started the game,
and sent round the hat for the Jubilee Fund.
Lady Musgrave has taken up the running in
Brisbane; and lots ot flunkejs will join in. There
are ribbons and other decorations sticking out, and
it is too good a chance to be missed by t the proni
ad terrarn crowd who always push themselves to
the front to do the lickspittle work.”
Pupjaub I nglis’s sapient scheme for re-
ducing the N.S.W. deficit by knocking off the
firewood allowance hitherto enjoyed by the public
schools of the colony is giving much satisfaction
to the doctors and undertakers. In the Kiandra
district, where the snow is sometimes feet high,
the tea-and tiger bagman’s name is held in almost
as great a veneration as that of the Herod who
wiped out the thousand innocents in one act. At
Dubbo the magnificent sum of 11s 6d. was raised
in the Boy’s School as a fire fund, but the girls’
department could only rake in 18d., and the
female pupils are therefore dependent for warmth
on the charity of the boys who toast themselves
first, and then slip out and hug the girls. E'ectors
in general agree that whatever troubles the man
from the Punjaub tray have in the next world a
lack of firewood will not be the most conspicuous.
We recommend the writer ,of tlie sub-
joined letter to apply, in the first place, to the
Secretary of the Law Institute of MS.W.,and
then, failing redress, to Chief Justice Darley :
“ Dear Bulletin,—Five weeks ago you com-
mented on the way in which the N.S.W. Law
Institute manages its affairs, and as I want to bring
the conduct of Mr. , solicitor, under the notice
of those to whom he is directly amenable, you will
confer a favour by stating who is tho person to
whom I should address a letter containing a sum-
mary of my case. The solicitor named charged
me £l7 17s. for the services of Barrister , who
did not appear to defend my case when tried ; he
has also charged me £l2 12s. for the services of
Barrister , who, according to the statement in
the bill of costs, left for England, taking the brief
with him, and Mr. Frank Rogers had to be
engaged (at £lO 10s.) to conduct the business
which the legal potentate who went to England
with ([presume) my money in Ms pocket, was
paid to perform. The solicitor refuses to deduct
from his bill the amounts first-named, and he
declines to write to the barristers concerned—l
don’t suppose they are much concerned—and ask
for a refund. His answer merely is : ‘ 1 paid
the n the money and cannot make myself offensive
to the profession, to my own injury !” i

At Campbelltown (N.S.W.), last week, a
gentleman resolved to clear the trees from his
paddtek by means of an explosive, and invited a
lot of friends to watch him do it. Then, having
placed a charge, he lighted the fuse and fled into
the wilderness. But there was no report, and
nothing happened. After a while he came back
in fear and trembling and attached several more
fuses; still no results. Then the visitors began
to grow tired and c immence to poke up the dan-
gerous animal with lights at the end of long poles
and similar contrivances, but though they scorched
the tail of the sleeping monster it still declined to
go off. It was only after this fun had gone on for
some hours that they discovered they had been
wasting their energies on a horse-ball.
The enterprise shown by the king of Aus-
tralian quartz-reefers, George Lansell, of Bendigo
(Vic.), has been attended with good results. He
sank his 180 ft. sba't to a depth of 2000 ft and dis-
covered payable reefs down to that point. For
the last two years be has been reaping a golden
harvest from these discoveries. His success gave
a wonderful impetus to the reeflog industry of
Bendigo, which was in a very depressed condition
at the time. _ The result was that active work
was resumed in practically abandoned mines, and
now there are several shafts in the district oyer
1800 ft. in depth. -What is best of all, payable
reefs have been struck. The latest discovery
has been made in the celebrated Extended Hust-
ler’s mine, which, with its tribute -called the
Pups—used to turn out between 0000 and 7000
ounces a fortnight in the early ’7o's. At a depth
of over 1800 ft., a large reef of exceeding richness
in some parts has been cut. It is a singular coin-
cidence that during the same week the Pups, after
years of prospecting in a gold-beariDg but not pay-
able reef, at a depth of over 1500 ft, came across a
payable “ shoot ”of gold. The value cf these dis-
coveries to Bendign, and to the mining industry of
Australia generally, cannot be overestimated.

His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir
Alban Riley, K.C.M.G., author of the £5 ba’e of
drapery and Lord Mayor of Sydney, will either
have to do his official Jub. very cheaply, or to pay
for it himself. The City Council has voted only a
beggarly £250 for the occasion, and this sum is to
b* devoted to the illumination of the Town Hall.
Miserable as is this concession to the spirit of
grovel which now stalks through the land, it was
only obtained at the cost of much seditious, not to
say treasonable, language from aldermen who did
not yearn over her Gracious, and who objected to
another man yearning at tho public expense. Sir
Alban has therefore been compelled to issue a cir-
cular to the citizens of Sydney calling on them to
assist in an arrangement by which some thou-
sands of children are to get their feet wet and be
stuffed with flabby pastry, and if this fails all will
be a b'ank. Even Tasmania is ahead of N.S.W.
this time. The Government at Hobart has re-
solved to turn 47 prisoners out of their comfort-
able cells on to the damp grass, and though several
have positively refused to quit, the military forces
will probably be able to Are them out. Melbourne,
too, is going for a general illumination, and the
loyal larrikins are called upon by the Press to
break every window which is left in darkness.
Compared to this the N.S.W. programme is no-
where, no matter how brightly the radiant bun
may rise in the East on the joyous morn of June
21.

Over-paid and under-worked people be-
longing to Her Majesty's service are always
offensively loyal, as indeed they ought to be. A
specimen of the genus had dinner on tho 24th at
the public table of a leading hotel, and, in the
fulness of his well-stimulated stomach, he arose
and in hiccuppy accents proposed “ The Queen."
To make the ceremony more impressive still, how-
ever, he endeavoured to sing the National Anthem,
which he rendered in something after this fashion ;
“ For she’s a zholly goo’ fell ——oh I mean, God
shave our Gray-shoes Quern,” &c. The effort was
much appreciated by the assembled company.
* * *
A suit for declaration of nullity of mar-
riage—Evans v. Trednenick —has been commenced
in the N.S.W. Supreme Court. The petitioner is
the husband, and the ground of the application is
that he was insane when the ceremony was per-
formed. But if this is accepted as a valid ground,
why, not merely a sixth but a twelfth judge will
have to be appointed.
Scene, the dinner-table of an Albury
(N.S.W.) hotel. Fireman (in uniform) to land-

landlord: “What do you mean?” Fireman

A woman went to have a dress fitted in

Cast-iron wreaths, block-tin floral emblems,
and all sorts of hideous metallic imitations of
natural flowers are now the fashion in London.
When it has come to this we reckon that poetry
and sentiment are played out. The man who
could plant brass flowers over his deceased wife
or dump down a bouquet made of old boiler plate
on the tomb of h ! s aunt, is too mean even to shec
his own tears. He would hire a professions
weepist to come and snullle over the dear de
parted in order to save the wear and tear of his
head.
Since the gilded calf of Sunbury began to

It is proposed to start a Press Club in
Sydney. They had one in Melbourne in 1884.
which met in rooms located on the same landing

room and bullied Briggs, an Age luminary, about
a pair of stays “ which you know perfectly well
should have been sent home quite a week ago.
You promised them last Wednesday evening
before 10.” The club died of selling too much
liquor for sixpence.

to expect women to hold their tongues even in the
most repressive ecclesiastical sense.
Sydney E. News, in its “Brevities”
column, is responsible for the following disloyal
and anti-Heatoaian sentiments:—
“ The Que;n is getting cranky in her old age. She has
been giving much trouble in regard to the jubilee celebration
arrangements." “ The London tradesmen are grumblin" at
the mean character of the royal programme for celebrating
the Jubilee. A royal procession by water was proposed
as one of the features of the celebration of the jubilee. .
The Queen objected, through sheer obstinacy, to the
project.
£*ow, what does this mean? Has Henniker
Heaton insulted Battenberg's baby, and been for-
bidden the sacred precincts of Frogmore House ?
and are the above paragraphs of a retaliatory
character ? Or has Alfred become disgusted him-
self with the whole loyal and noble hierarchy, in
consequence of the “ jook’s darter,” who does the
social for the Down and Gomtree, having struck

She was a widow, aged about 26, and as
pretty as she well could be. Her late husband
had just been put down beside the early worm,
and she went every morning to weep over his
ashes and irrigate the vegetables that grew above
his head. She had a little pale face, a pair of
violet eyes, a fluff of brown hair, and a No. 1 shoe,
and her voice was full of tears, also she wanted
to have something really utter erected to mark
the spot where he lay. The monument artist
showed her a whole book of designs, and sho
finally selected an affair at 100 guineas which re-
presented a white celestial visitant without any
boots perched on a broken stump. She said she
would call again and give a definite order, but
when she re appeared in three months’ time she
had not yet fully made up her mind She was not
quite se tearful, however, and this time she
imagined that a £2O slab would do. A month
later she returned again, together with a gentleman
whom she addressed as “George,” and gave an
off-hand o der for pretty Well any kind of a hunk
of brick with a name and date on it, value not to
exceed £5, and the mason to use his own judg-
ment, and s'.am it down on top of the grave when
finished. She re-appeared, however, two days
later, in a breathless state, followed by “ George,”
and explained that the departed had always hated
ostentation, and never like! the idea of anything
heavy above his sepulchre. “Something very
plain, now,” she began, but the mason interrupted
her by suggesting a split stick with the deceased’s
visiting-card on top, and the pair went off' in a
huff. Consequently there is at least one grave
which goes bare for want of a monument, and is
likely to do so to the end.
The Lithgow Mercury- professes to know

A colonel of the military forces down
South, whose sight is defective, was “ evoluting"
his men in his usual peremptory manner. After
certain words of command, he gave one which
wasn’t attended to—so he thought. He stopped
confounded for the moment, and proceeded with
others with a like result. This was rather annoy-
ing, but it was a great deal more so for the gal-
lant warrior to hear a small boy shout out : “ Yer
men are right over there, mister —that’s the ceme-
try fence ! ” And still he keeps on active (?)
service.
A correspondent kindly writes us a long:
letter on “How Larrikins are made,” but this
subject seems to in 10 be pretty well pumped dry.
Perhaps “ How Larrikinesses are made ” would be
worth investigating now for a change We
studied this point once in a corner boarding house
where a young and rather pretty servant girl
smiled an innocent smile as she brought up the
chops in the morning. She had four sweethearts
at once, and every evening they whistled one at
each corner below the windows. Then she would
dodge out by the side entrance and go off for a
walk with one of the quartet*e, leaviag the others
tooting with no one to listen. After a while the
discovered that she possessed dramatic talent,
and with the view of ultimately becoming a star
actress she took a position as the hied legs of an
elephant in a pantomime. When the pantomime
ended the behemoth was stowed away along with
the icebergs and the sheol-fire in the property room.
The forelegs took a billet in a public-house and the

industry well, the story end 3 here. Ic is a
nice little Sunday-school tale, and perhaps may do

The policy of marrying young girls to
antiquated money-bags has received a temporary
check in Victoria. One very disconsolate widow
has been left with about a quarter of what she
expected, and is Ki’oaniug beneath the testamen-

again. Another has been served even worse. We
aren’t sorry for this ; giv e the young men a show.

Some years ago, Kong Meng, the well-known
Chinese merchant, of Melbourne, got into a Rich-
mond ’bus and was there accosted by a cheeky
youth, who, not knowing that any gentlemen
came from China, thought to take a rise out of
K.M. “Ah, John!” he exclaimed, “you no
savte, hey ?” But .Kong was more than equal to
the occasion. Said he : “ Look here, sir. If you
will be good enough to speak English, or French,
or German, or Chinese, or Dutch, I will converso
with you, for all those languages I thoroughly
understand. I can even comprehend you if you
speak Spanish, though I am sorry to say that my
Spanish, through long disuse, has grown a little
rusty. But, please do not again address me in a
dialect which should only be used by you for con-

Mr. Justice Stephen is already dissatisfied
with the judgment-seat. He has discarded the
luxurious leather-covered easy chair for a plain
cane-bottomed one. We can cite threo cases in
support of his Honor's decision in favour of cane.
They are Victorian cases, and as we forget the
“ referenco," they must be accepted ex relation t
The Bulletin. The late Judge Fellows, imme-
diately he was raised to the Bench, declined to sit
on stuffed leather or anything but simple cane,
though, by the way, he afterwards frequently
“ sat on ” windbags. So one of the Judicial chairs
was re-seated with cane for his particular benefit.
After Fellows s death this ohair remained unused
till Holyroyd was made a judge, and then Hdwarc
Dundas appointed himself sole legatee of Thoma
Howard’s chair, which he considered he fllle
with equal dignity and learning. This might
chair has to be laboriously carried about by th

dance, on the stage of Drury Lane Theatre. A
“large number of the leading actresses of Lon
don ” took part in the hop. Sir P. A. Jennings
made his debut on the boards of old Drury in ai
Irish jig with Ellen Terry, and “Sir” James
Lorimcr did a Highland Fling with Violet Cameron
We are not infoimed whether the delegates' wives
were there.
Mrs. Fellows, widow of the late Judge
of the Victorian Supreme Court, was the inventor
a few years ago of the “In Memoriam” column
in the Argus from which the Age and the S. M’
Herald copied. Mrs. F. inserted amongst the
“deaths” an anniversary commemoration of the
decease of her adopted daughter, but without any
pome. Then followed all the miles of ungramma-
tical and gushing lamentations, and the acres of
doggrel verse, which have since been contributed
to the Melbourne and Sydney papers from Colling-
wood Flat and Woolioomooloo. Mrs. Fellows has
never since sent an “In Memoriam” to the papers.
The good lady evidently feels that she has done
an irreparable injury to society. A vengeful Mel-
bourne man once proposed to present Mrs. F.
witli an album containing all the elegiac and
epitaphical “ poetry ” which had appeared in the
papers sinoe she started the racket.

swindling prices, a series of screams passing under
the name of a concert, or the maniac gestures of

with the editor of the Examiner. We

Dear Bulletin, —Don’t you think you are
rather giving yourself away by letting the Potts Pointers
know that the Surgeons-general are calling themselves
“ General.” In Jersey, 30 years ago< there were two generals
whom I could never spot, in our monthly Eighteen-penny
Prayer-bsok (the Army List). One was a deputv-assistant-
quartermaster-general and the other an ex-assistant-com-
missary-general, ranking respectively as ensign and cornet,
although they were over 60 years old. See what you have
done! The trumpet and sergeant-majors of the Sydney
Lanceahs will be Major Pottdu-Point and Major Ventre-;V
Terre ; every gun-captain of the Naval Brigade will be Cap-
tain H.M.S. Sir Henry; and Heaven knows where th
game you have started will end. Even the captain-general
(if there is one) of the N.S.W. Fall-Backs will be “ morning,
general—does Germany mean war?” The Colonial Secre-
tary might travel (among mugs) incog, as Colonel Parses.
You’ve made an error.— Hiram Abiff.

Sir Sawmill Griffith, K.C.M.G., Premier
of Queensland, and the Chinaman’s best friend,
has been revisiting the ’ome of his hancestors. At
Alerthyr he blossomed into a hero, being welcomed
by the school children, a body of townspeople, the
police, millionaire Crawshay, of Oyfarthfa, a
deputation, a brass band, a fish-cart, and a pig’s-
trotter man, and he was hauled through the
streets in a borrowed carriage amid great excite
ment. In the evening there was a banquet, and
Sir Sawmill rose with tears in his voice, after the
beef and grass had been cleared away, and told
the people how glad he was to return to his birth-
place. (Cheers.) It was the only birthplace he
ever had, and he meant to Btiok to it. He had
been born there when very young, at which period
of his life he had not the full use of his legs, and
when he became an angel and a pair of wings
grew out of his shoulder-blades, he hoped to be
buried there. His object all his life had been to
do good, and he meant to keep on doing it. Then
there were more drinks, and Griffith Ap Griffiths,
seconded by Evan Ap Evans, and ably backed by
John Ape. Jones, stated that they all felt proud
and happy on this auspicious occasion.

Mr. J. T. M'Mahon, assistant-Superin-
tendent Post Office Department, Sydney, is to be
married this month to Mrs. M. O’C. Blake, of
Hawthorn, Waverley.
Of entrancing interest to all loyal subjects,
and especially to Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins is the fol-
lowing ingenuous par, cut from the last letter of
the Sydney Morning Herald’s London corre-
spondent :
“ The Queen when she makes these visits abroad always
sleeps in her own bed. It is sent on from Windsor, and is a
plain low bedstead, with simple bedding and eurtains. Her
bath is also sent on ahead, and other familiar and useful
articles accompany her on her travels.”
How is it that those dense people, the Fairfaxes,
don’t get a stipendiary humorist on their staff ?
But hold—perhaps they do. Perhaps he’s their
London correspondent.
The Yankee “ surprise party ” is gradually
becoming acclimatisfd in N S.W., and a brutally
commonplace and vulgar nuisance it is. The
basis of this alleged entertainment consists in a
lot of men and women rushing the house of a
friend who doesn’t expect and probably doesn’t
desire visttors, and making a night of it on his
premisos, while he wishes them in Gehenna, but
doesn’t care to tell them so. These Goths bring
their own provisions with them ; they also bring
their own music by way of adding insult to injury,
and grind out harp obligatos full of unshed tears
without asking permission. When they first ap-
pear they are disguised in loose white robes, caps,
and masks, but after a while they take off these
costumes and reveal their native ugliness, and at
this crisis each one dumps down his toothsome
bun and his bundle of carrots on the table, and
the feeding commences. Sometimes the host is
apprised in an underhand way of what is going to
happen, but as a rule the ca'amity hursts on him
suddenly. The performance concludes about
midnight, and when the crowd, which is to the
last as clumsy and inconsiderate as a lame
elephant, has been seen safely off the premises,
the depressed victim looks round on a scene of
crumbs, fragments, dirty plates, and fruit squashed
into the carpet, and anathematises his visitors
with a curse which no curae yet built can compare
to. Then he goes to bed, and a badly scared cat
crawls out of its concealment and spends the
night walking over the wreckage, and next morn-
ing is found very ill from indigestion and repent
ing in the hack yard.
Even the weather is a bit of a humbug
and the sun is an arrant courtier There was, for
a wonder, fine weather for the N.S.W volunteer
review on 24th May. Three thousand troops were
on the ground. Hundreds of people went to see,
and the Governor, in pursuance of a costly old-
world superstition, was received with an expen-
sive and unmeaning salute of 17 guas Laly
Oarington, who rode by the side of her lord, aud
attracted much attention, wore a most becoming
riding-habit of navy blue cloth and a silk hat.
The most gorgeous personages at the show were
members of the Sydney corps of Lancers, who, as
they all carry coloured poles, seem to be barbers
by trade. They indulged in various intricate and
puzzling manoeuvres of horsemanship to attract
the attention of the girls, and succeeded according
to their different degrees of incompetence. One
beardless boy in regimentals and sabretache, with
a hideous javelin sticking out of the heel of his
boot, galloped up and down the line incessantly,
apparently with »o other object than to
wind his horse. At all events he succeeded
The whole affair was of a draper's-apprensioe-
flnery style of magnificence.
The bachelors of Windsor (N.S.W.) gave a

Dancing was continued until 4 a.m.

On Thursday, 26 h May, the Benedicts of

way. They don t now. The hall was decorated
with arches of evergreens, bouquets, flags, Chinese
lanterns, &c The Governor and Lady Carington
arrived at 9 o’clock, accompanied by Lord
Bertie, Captain Sheriffc, and Mr. WallingtoD,
Lady Carington wore a dress of rich

black satin and lace; Mrs. Prendergasc, pale

It is now the correct caper in Melbourne
society for young girls to be escorted to the
theatre by married men who leave their wives at
home. It is also correct for young wives to pay
long visits once a year or so to their friends in
another colony, and to go round anywhere and
everywhere accompanied by a tame male dude
whom they introduce as a “ cousin.” There has
been a wonderful increase of “ oousins ” of late.
N.B.—Divorce Court business is looking up.
The S.M. Herald informs us that in the
“ course of a few remarks,” Lord Brassey
gave it out that he was “in favour of Im-
perial Federation 1 ” Lord Brassey surely didn't
come all the way from London to inform us poor
“ colonists ” that Queen Anno is dead 1 We knew

Lord B. was favourable to Imperial Federation,
even though we have never grovelled at his num-
ber nines. We will now go a step further and
upon our very own unauthorised responsibility
will state that Lord Sunbeam Brassey revels in the
Imperial Institute—opposes Home Rule for Ire-
land—swears by H.R.H. Albert Edward —wor-
ships every statute of Albert the Good—supperts
every Tory motion, and takes off his beaver every
time a penny whistle, with a ragamuffin at the
end of it, toots out the National Anthem. We
will now take up a collection.
It is stated in Melbourne that Miss Duffy,
daughter of Sir C, Gavan D., will shortly enter a

In the Cabbage-Garden, the other day, a
fair and fascinating girl fell desperately in love
with a dark moustaohe which heartily recipro-
cated her more than platonic affection. Unfor-
tunately, the gentleman was as poor as a journal-
ist, and the girl a portionless orphan. As there
was evidently no earthly prospect of holy matri-
mony, the girl, with a rapid and comprehensive
wink to her alter ego, accepted the offer of a
I weal thy old soul with the gout and a blind eye, and
tripped off to the altar blushing in white satin and
orange-blossoms. The honeymoon waxed and
waned, and the old buffer was delighted with his
gazelle cyed charmer. They came home and
Everton toffee was a circumstance to the sweets
of their connubiality. One day, however, hubby
returned from the office to find his bride placidly
resting herself on the knee of a dark-moustached
dude who was giving a lecture on osculation,
with diagrams. “ Mr?. !'’ roared the spouse
dropping his black bag and gamp—“ Madam ! ! ! ”
Up jumped the lady with the sweetest of smiles
and explained that this was her dear, dear brother
just back from ’Frisco ! The old man seemed to
accept the situation, and even asked the long lost
fraternal to dinner. The lady thought matters
were just booming, and practised her usual wifely
airs with a face placid enough to mislead Othello
himself. But the next evening a tornado with the
gout and a blind eye burst upon that household.
The husband had been to the Registrar-General's
office, and had discovered th\t the parents of “ the
wee wifie " had given to the world nothing be-
yond the lady who now bore his name. The cur-
tain fell on a yellow-haired angel weeping on the
outside of a suburban villa
From the S.M. Herald :
“ Q-IRLS wanted, for fitting up. Apply Picture and
Show Frame Factory, 399 George-street."
They fit up the blondes, we suppose, with blue,
The dashing brunettes with pink,
The brown-haired girls in some sombre hue,
Such as seal or pearl-grey, we think ;
So if you’re in want of a girl to match
Your drawing or dining-room suite,
You say, “Send me round with the greatest
despatch
A girl fitted up in red-beet.”
At one of the balls recently given at a
certain colonial Government House, a young man
overheard the following conversation between His
Excellency and the local French Consul. The
Consul was supporting the ball-room wall and
watching the dancers when H.E. came up.
“ What! not dancing?” he said in French, “ Why
don’t you?” “Because I cannot,” returned the
other in the same language. “ Pooh ! ” continued
lI.E. with a chuckle, “ Anything does for them
out here! If you find yourself in a hole shake
hands." But the worst impertinence lies in the
fact that the two Personages believed themselves
unintelligible to those present because they spoke
in French!
A very swell dinner was given at a certain
Australian club not long ago, and on the bill of
fare was bcche-de-mer soup. This petage. on
which the Club rather plumes itself, happened to
be made from beche de-mer supplied by a well-
known South Sea trading captain, who, being a
bit of a wag in his way, and addicted to ghastly
jokes, played a horrible trick on the select com-
pany. In short, he mixed with the sea-slugs cer-
tain dried trophies cut from the human body by
South Sea warriors who had slain iheir enemies in
battle. He (the captain) loudly boasted of the
success of his “practical joke” before leaving
port, and now it is utterly unsafe to ask any mem-
ber of that club how he likes beehe-de-mer.
Hideous as is this story, which is strictly true, it
is not much more horrible than that related of the
French liberc who, while on his way to Europe,
told Mr. Henniker Heaton that “he had expiated
his offence and was now going to spend the rest of
his days at Nancy.” Being pressed, he stated
that the “ offence ” in question had con-
sisted of secretly kilJi' g his wife’s lover, frying
the liver of that amorous gentleman, and serving
it up for the breakfast of the unsuspecting lady.
But there is nothing new under the sun. “How
did you like the dish you have just eaten ?” asked
the haughty baron. “It was good, my lord,” re-
plied the baroness. “It should indeed have been
swee',” said the baron, with blazing eye and cor-
rugated brow, “ for it was the heart of your lover
Raoul de Courcy.” Where did we read it? Well,
wasn’t it in “Haddon Hall?”
* * *
It must be a woman who “ dashes off” the
SM. Herald's “In the House” report. Who
but a dear young thing with banged hair and a
forty inch crinolette could possibly write this :
“ Members lay about in various attitudes of somnolence
and indifference ; and the Sergeant-at-Arms—the genial,
handsome, and dignified Sergeant-at-Arms—meditatively
stroked his moustache.”
Why, it reads like the opening chapter of a
boudoir novel. Apropos, the N.S. W. SergeaDt-at-
Arms, now we come to tbink of it, really is a
gorgeously handsome young man. He revels in
his abnormal muscularity, and has a grip like
that of a grizzly bear. The girls like to shake
hands with the Sergeant. He always makes them
feel as if lie were taking them into his custody.
* * *
Matters matrimonial must be dull at pre*
sent. A groom on the Bourke-Wanaaring (N.S. W.)
road who wished to become a bridegroom recently
advertised for a wife in one of the weekly news-
papers, with the result that there were thirty-six
applicants for the job. Letters asking for the ap-
pointment came from all parts of Australia.
A certain Sydney alderman proposes to
attend Mayor Riley’s Jubilee Fancy Dress Bali in
the character of “John Brown, late of Windsor
Castle.” A new Treason Felony Act should be
framed to meet the case.
It came out the other day that an English
half-pay naval officer, now serving in a colonial
ship, remitted to his wife and family (whom he had
left behind in England) the sum of £2 in three
months. They are now “on the parish.” He
may be a good officer, but the ratepayers who are
supporting his wife and family no doubt have
their own opinions concerning his value as a
husband.
The opinion gradually gains ground that
Governor Carington should have been the ad-
vance agent of a circus. He can make a big
“ splash ” without spending too much money. Now
that we come to think over the matter Governor
Carington is the advance-agent for a circus. The
Imperial circus.
Which indirectly reminds one that the
wail of the hungry K.C.M.G. comes across the
hollow-sounding and mysterious sea. Her Gracious
has invited the Knights and Companions of St.
Drinkall and St, George to dine in the royal
palace of St. James, and she has left them to find
and pay for their own refreshments. Victoria,
by the grace of God, gives elbow room gratis, but
tire victuals must be paid for at so much a head.
She doesn’t even stand the mustard or “ shout”
some tea and shrimps or a trifle of bloater paste ;
everything from the gin down to the fried sausage
has got to be defrayed by the company, and
they will probably be charged for breakages.
St. George’s Hall, Windsor, was built at the
expense of the nation as a place where the
Order could meet and have an unleavened bun
and a little milk on occasion, but there they
would have to be catered for by her Gracious at,
say, half-a-crown a head, and she will see the
whole Australian peerage swamped with one
wide, scathing, far-reaching, comprehensive curse,
dead, skinned, embalmed, and seated in kilts
upon a prickly pear before she will stand a dinner
to anybody. If the Imperial Conference dele-
gates don’t like it they can do the other thing. If
any K.C.M.G. won’t face the expense he can go
and dine by himself on bread and butter and a
suspicious egg in a fourpenny ham-shop, or he can
jubilate in the coffee-room of his own hotel. It
doesn't matter to her Gracious either way ; one
hungry and disgusted Australian more or less is of
very small account, indeed, now-a-days.
Several baubles, it is said, will shortly be
conferred in Victoria through the agency of the
Imperial Conspiracy. Duncan Gillies and Mayor
Cain are to be made K. C. M. G’s. ; E. G. Fitzgibbon
and R. L. J. Ellery are to be C.M.G’d., and per-
haps the Chancellor of Melbourne University may
get something. It's not likely that they will go
through the farce of trying to lay a poisoned bait
for (all honest men between Cape York to Cape
Otway will here take their hats off) Chief Justice
Iliginbotham.
Dr. Bevan, the swell divine of Melbourne,
is one of those clergymen who delight in telling
people that Her Gracious is a great deal better
than her predecessors. This we cheerfully admit.
On 24th May he said that when, at 12 years old,
she was informed that she would be Queen, she
replied that “ she would be good ” Our live-year-
old, we have discovered, makes the same remark
when we administer parental rebuke in the shapo
of a spanking for drowning the cats of an exten-
sive district in the family tank. And yet Dr.
Bevan never says anything nice about him,
There was a row among the waiters assist-
ing at Sir Henry Loch’s last big dinner. Two of
them wanted to have it out in the banquet-hall,
with the great man as bottle-holder. Not that
' Governor Loch is much of a bottle-holder. Always
helps himself, and passes it along, yerknow.
Sir Henry Loch takes more after his
Gracious Sovereign every day. At his Queen’s
Birthday banquet two hairy-legged pipers prowled
about the banquet-hal), playiDg something which
was commonly believed to be Sheol. Her Graciou*
adopts the same device to keep people from com-
ing too often.
At Manchester, the other day, Bishop
Moorhouse (childless) said curates had no business
to get married before they could afford to support
a large family. At Melbourne, last week, Bishop
Goe (also married and childless) said ‘ ‘ when he
heard of the numberof marriages which were cele-
brated at St. Jude’s Church he was not at al
surprised at the populous state of Carlton.” What
do Moorhouse and Goe know practically of these
matters ? If the other fellows were like them
there would bs no families to support, and Carlton
would soon be depopulated. They remind ns of
elderly spinsters discussing the joys of honej-
mooning.


ANOTHER INDIAN MUTINY.
Ever and anon the queston crops up among
thinking men—“ Will there he another Indian
Mutiny?” We give a few reasons for and against
euch a contingency.
The Optimist’s view : —The mutiny of 1857 was
only a mutiny of native soldiers. The soldier of
to day is far more loyal and enlightened. There
are thoutandt of native soldiers drawning pensions
whose voice is in fcivor of peace. Let the present
ruling power be overthrown, and the land is a prey
to the feuds of Mussulman and Hindoo. Mission-
aries are yearly extending Christianity. By means
of the railways now in existence troops—of whom
there are more than 70.000 in India—can be rapidly
massed, and crush out any incipient rebellion. As
little as the Indian loves !lie English, he loves the
Russian less. The manifold interests of all India
are bound up in the preservation of peace.
The Pessimist’s view: —The next uprising will
not be a mutiny of soldiers, but the revolt of a
people. The nal ive soldier pensioners could easily
be alienated by guaranteeing pensions under a na-
tive form of government. Although there are dif-
ferences between Mussulman and Hindoo, it Is noth-
ing like as marked as in years past. Britsh educa-
tion is di-solving the old faiths, but is putting
nothing in their places. The missionaries cannot
keeppacewith the state-aided schools. Christianity
amorg the natives is yet too small a force to enter
into practical politics. As to the railways, the
Government h»s allowed native engine drivers,
stokers and guards; tt e lines are too long to be
well guarded, and in case of revolt, would
practically be under native control. The trade
of India is quite independent of the Govern-
ment. To Indian toleration is ccmiog a powerful
ally—the growth of natioal life. Englishmen have
given the educated natives of all creeds a common
language. A bin d devotion to their leaders is a
characteris ic cf the Ind an races, ’here is very
much less respect for the Europeans than formerly.
Toe taxation of India, for interest on debt, railway
loans, pensions, etc., is over £37,000,000 peram.um
all of which would be wiped out if India were free
from England. Ihe national congresses are the
begir nings of national life. The na' ional vanity of
the Indian native is rising like a flood, lie sees no
reason for being taxed to pay Europeans togovern
him, when he could do it hinself, and fur far less
money than it now costs him. “England in
India,” to quot 9 a native writer in the native
press, “is simply a wise and benevolent des.
potism.”
Frank Stuart, cf 28 Fieeschool-st., Calcutta, a
gentleman widely and favourably known through-
out the length and breadth of India, and with un-
surpassed opportunities in his professional capacity
for obtaining inside opinions on questions of
national importance, tells the following interest-
ing and remarkable story ;—ln 1875 I arrived in
Calcutta. About three months after that time,
one afternoon in the Great Eastern Hotel, I was
prostrated with a sudden attack of illness. I did
not know what was the matter, but a gentleman
present said, ‘ It’s your liver.” I was conveyed
te Scott Thomas’s to see Dr. Ferris, but he was
out. I was then taken home in a “ polkee,” and
a medical man called, who said I had congestion
of the liver. I was very ill for the following ten
days. Between 1875 and 1881 I had, in Calcutta,
Madras, Bombay, Rangoon, Hong Kong and
•hanghai, about twenty of these terrible attacks.
In 1881, when in Shanghai being very ill, I deter-
mined to go to Japan. Kn route I met Captain
Connor, of the “Geukai Maru,” Japanese
Steamship Company, and be at once accosted
me with, “Good , man, what is the
matter with you?” I replied, “Liver and
kidneys.” “You look terribly ill. Have
you ever tried so-and-so?”—naming a pro-
prietary medicine. “No,” with a forced smile.
He then told me how he had suffered from conges-
tion of the kidneys and liver, that he was so bad
that he lost four stone in weight, resolved to give
up his command, and had almost seriously con-
templated suicide, when casually an American
passenger told him of the wonderful results
achieved by the use of Warner's safe cure. “Any
port in a storm,” said the gallant skipper, and as
soon as possible began its ug9. In a week he got
great relief, and two months after—at the time he
told me this—he had made up his lost flesh, with
a bit over, and was the personification of health
and strength. He concluded his narrative with:
“ God bless the day I took Warner’s safe cure!
You try it, Frank.” I did. and before I had
finished the first bottle the pain under my right
shoulder was much easier, the acid esuctations
ceased, and my stomach began to do its work
properly. I continued to improve, and when I
had taken fifteen b rttles I found myself a new
man, with a sound, hear y appetite, ti e rough
enjoyment of the society of my friends, zest for
business, full and true appreciation of amusement,
and a calm pleasure in life, unspeakable. To all
these things I had been a stranger for six long
years. Would I not indeed be ungrateful did I
not earnestly and conscientious'y urge upon all
suffering from internal mutiny to at once put it
down and for ever, by the use of that peacefal
power I have mentioned, which not only heals
existing evils, but permanently eradicates bad
blood —the pot- nt factor in all revolts.—Frank
Stuart.*
Ihey go one better in Paree. Says the
gifted “ Stella,” in the Sydney Morning Hkrai d,
in re the sale of the French Crown iewels :

The Keferee
Saturday proved a miserable day for the
intercolonial eight-oar raoe, rowed this year on
the Parramatta, and the show made by the Sydney
crew was in keeping with the day The Victorians
were out first, and were detained fully 15 minutes in
the bleak rain before N.S.W. embarked in their
eight at the starting-point. Victoria got a shade
the best of the start and continued to draw out a
lead until the mile point was approached, when
Bros quickened up and drew nearly level, Victoria
Bhooting the point in smin. 2sec. After this the
pace began to tell on the Sydney crew, who rowed
a bit wildly, and nearing Putney, Gerald Kennedy,
No. 3, caught a very bad crab, throwing No. 2,
Freeman, out of his stroke, and bow, Seale, off his
slide. The race was then virtually over, as Seale,
after a vain attempt to fix his slide, settled down
to rowing as on a fixed seat, and the Victorians
passed the win Ding-post any number of lengths to
the good in 17min. 12jsec. The time, carefully
taken by chronograph, is the fastest yet done in
an intercolonial eight-oar race.
* • •
From the start the Victorians showed
superiority in their style, and the accident, or
rather bad fvrm of the N.S.W. crew approaching
Putney, did not affect the result of the race. The
Victorians with the medium slide reached out
equally, and with a “ lift all together " at the
beginning of the stroke, the boat fairly jumped
from under them. The Sydney stroke, Bros,
rowed splendidly, but there was an absence in the
orew of the clean life so noticeable with the Vic-
torians, and, notwithstanding the long slide and
dragging stroke of the local crew, they rowed ihe
faster stroke. The N.S.W. eight did a trial in
17min. 4sec., but when asked to race the distance
in eight seconds more they conclusively showed
that they were not constructed in that manner.

lines of the House of Bruns viok—the rcy 1 in England, and
the ducal ia Germany—and L connected by marriage with
most of the ruling r ices in Europe. The memory of this

, QNE OF THE SIGHTS
A casual glance at 008 George-street conveys
but little idea of the Series of large and well-
stocked Showrooms and Factories, and Stores ad-
joining the main Entrance to Australia’s Pre-
mium Emporium.
I It was only last Saturday that a well-known
and popular member of the present Ministry
paid the Central Emporium a visit, and these
were his words :
“Wei l , LAWLER, I had thought, and so
had many others, that you were confined to the
Manufacture of Bedding and Upholstery. I
knew you were aufa.it in those departments, and
that your name was identified with the supply
of Bedsteads and Chairs ; but it is to me a
surprise to find so extensive, yet withal decep
tive-looking an establishment in our midst
Why here are Carpets and Linoleums, Bedsteads
by the hundred, Bedaing and bed hangings,
Bedroom suites, Drawing and Dining-room furni-
ture, Boots and Shoes, Ironmongery and Earthen-
ware, Glass and China, Drapery of all kinds, Mer-
cery, Hats, Caps, and Ties. Why, as viewed
from your narrow frontage the whole thing
seems marvellous.”
And marvellous the Establishment most surely
is, net only in the surprise it occasions those who
walk through its rooms and multitudinous pas-
sages ; but in the stock— the excellent quality :
the high-class style ; the superior finish of goods
that none ever believed could be sold at the ex-
traordinary low prices that from the Ist to
the 6th story and right throughout those 12
immense showrooms dobs everywhere obtain.
Boasting will not sustain the hundred hands
umd more engaged in oonnecticn with LAWLER’S
CENTRAL EMPORIUM.
NO ! NO 1 NO 1 VALUE AND GOOD GOODS
ALONE WILL DO THAT. And let anyone who
has PURCHASED AT THE EMPORIUM—and •
their name is legion—let anyone whe has pur-
chassd say they have been badly served or have
not received most excellent VALUE for THEIR
MONEY, and the aocount will be most willingly
refunded Now a word or two as to how goods
oan be both good and cheap at LAWLER'S. It
is supposed, and with truth too, that best goods
cannot be sold cheap ; but then one ought to re-
member that that applies to goods bought in
this market. Those who Import and hold
goods for the trade must have their pro-
fit. The trade who buy from these
colonial warehousbmbn must la turn have
their profit, and the retail purchaser i« the
“ poor pilgarllo ” who, in the end, has to pay about
50 per cent, upon landing price, instead of from
T 4 per cent, to 15 per cent, as at A DIRECT IM-
PORTING and MANUFACTURING ESTAB-
LISHMENT like LAWLERS.
CHEAP GOODS are too often associated with
Che taint of the auction room to find much
favour with general purchasers. Well, all
knew the auctioneers cannot lose; neither do the
franufaoturers in the old oountry ; or else those
“ worthies ’’ would not oontinue rushing con-
signment upon consignment year after year into
the auction rooms of the colonies. Stuff at auc-
tion is always dear, however low the price ; be-
cause it has been slopped up and prepared
specially for a precarious and low price
AUCTION TRADE.
But best goods CAN BE SOLD CHEAP AND WILL
BE lold cheap at LAWLER’S because LAW-
LER’S buyers have the money at their back,
and no expense is spared upon their travelling
expenses from seat to seat of the old country
and Amebican and Continental manufactur-
ing centres. IMPORTING DIRECT and MAN-
UFACTURING HERE, ALL GOODS are FIRBT-
CLASS and PRICES EXCEEDINGLY LOW.
If yon want to lay out £3O in BEDSTEADS
and FURNITURE you will save at least £6 by
purchasing at the GREAT CENTRAL EMPO-
RIUM. If you purpose FURNISHING at a cost
of £6O you will save £l5. And if in the FUR-
NISHING of a first-class RESIDENCE or HOTEL
you intend an outlay of a few hundred, then
WITHOUT DOUBT OF ANY KIND WHATEVER YOU
will save £100; because £24 10s. will supply
suites at LAWLER’S that you will be asked £35
FOR ALL OVER THE CITY. AND SO UPON EIGHT OR
NINE ITEMS YOU WILL HAVE SAVED THE £lOO.

London Town Talk.
FROM THEIR LONDON CORRESPONDENT (VIDE
MELBOURNE ARGUS, MAY 13, 1887).
The Waterbury Watch Company seems deter-
mined to make the Oxford and Cambridge bo*t
race a “time bargain.” The enterprising pro-
prietors have, they inform us, “ chartered all tho
available steamers of the Thames steamboat
Company,” to which they have cordially invited,
for the purpose of viewing the spectacle, every man
and woman and child who can exhibit a Waterbury
watch instead of the usual ticket at the gangway.
A special steamer will be employed for ladies and
children, and ladies accompanied by gentlemen,
but they must all have Waterbury Watches.
Apprehensive, however, that this may include the
entire population of London, the proprietors state
that the boats will leave early enough to admit of
the disapointed ones going by rail. They cannot,
at all events, pretend that they are not acquainted
with the time of day. All persons accepting this
disinterested invitation “thereby pledge them-
selves to behave decently and in order. Anyone
breaking this pledge (a word which is very
appropriate, by the way, to watch-owners) will be
immediately put ashore or ‘chucked’ ove*board
by the police on duty.” This is certainly the most
comical as well as ingenious advertisement that
ever was penned. One thousand Waterbury
balloons, with coupons attached to them, wili bo
released during the race, and the coupons will be
exchanged for watches at any of the London depots.
I congratulate the company on its enterprise, and
suggest a motto for the mantelpiece of its board-
room-—“ A violet by a mossy stone, half-hidden
from the eye.” Their advertisement is an admir-
able one, though to persons who are nervous on
the river the name of the society —Waterbury—
will not be reassureing.
We might add the Company has recently opened
branch offices at 9 William-street, Melbourne, and
56 Margaret-street, Sydney, to facilitate their
Australasian trade.
Seven-tenths of the dry portion of corn is

Charley Montrose, the veteran Pressman,
at present editor of the Wangaratta (Vic ) Des-
patch, was lately at a small Milesianly-promoted
race-meetiDg at Wangaratta. As is usual at such
affairs “the bhoys.” after “liquoring,” considered
that the day’s enjoyment could only be properly
wound up by the breaking of somebody’s skull.
After ten or eleven fights had been enjoyed by
the company the subject of athletics in all its
branches became the principal topic discussed.
Cnarley, in his usual perky tone 3, said : “I’ve a
good mind to start a fencing-class in Wangaratta. ’
This riled Timothy O’Brady, who couldn’t tolerate
being taught anything in the way of agriculture
after his “ thurrty year experience.” “Shure,”

exclaimed Tim, “an’ its dam little you know
about feacin’.” And then uprose the great Mont-
rose in the middle of the room : “ Damn you,
sir—do you know that I was for nine years in the
British Army ! ” Timothy : “I don’t care whether
you were nineteen yea r s in the British Army. I
can tell by ihe look of yer that ye never did much
fencing. Cive just finished a mile and a half of
it” Montrose; “You infernal scoundrel, I’ll
punch your head ! ” Timothy (with many adjec-
tives): “Come outs : de, ye spalpeen!” Coats
were thrown ofF, and they were about to begin the
slaughter, when some cool outsider stepped be-
tween them with : “ Gentlemen, there is evidently
a misapprehension between you Mr. Montrose
no doubt means fencing with the foils, while you
(addressing Tim) mean fencing—erecting posts and
rails.” Tim said: “t-hure and of course,” while
Charley said : “ You are*too ignorant to talk to,
sir.” Tim has stopped subscribing to the journal
over which Charley presides, and glories to tell
his fiiends how he took down the “ blathering im-
poster who tried to talk to him about fencing.”
Charley, on the other hand, slates that the only
specimen of a goriila uncaged in Australia resides
in the vicinity of Wangaratta.
An authentic parrot story. An old maiden
lady, pious as ancient maiden ladies uusuaUy are,
the other day attended a sale of household goods
in Sydney. Her heart yearned for the family
parrot, an ugly but eloquent bird, which, like
everything else on the premises, was to pass
through the hands of the remorseless auctioneer ;
so she sidled up to him with “ cluck, click,
Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly 1” She was removed
in a dead faint when the unsympathetic hot to
say brutal bird exclaimed : “ Get out, you d
old hag!” It has since been ascertained that the ;
parrot's owner had been living in the same house
with his mother-in-law.
An eminent English “ swell,” renowned
alike for the suavity of his manners and the
“s >i aggerness ” of his appearance on the block,
has condescended to shed the refulgence of his
gaze on Sydney’s “beautiful harbour,” provided
he finds the local tailors at all endurable. But his
recent experience of one prominent Sydney
sartorialist has been unfortunate. The colonial
snip doesn’t like trouble, and refused to be tow
upon a rare and radiant masher’s tweed exterior
that attention with which one meets at Poole’s.
A pa*r of riding-breeches, about the fit of which
our ttylish friend was rather particular, com-
pletely broke up the compiler of “block ’ fixtures
and he refused to be further bothered. “ The
foreman was frightened—worried, you know, and
really, after all,’’ &c. “Oh ! if that's the position
of affairs, I’ll at once give you a cheque, and go
elsewheio.’ So the Englishman gave the cheque.
The tailor thought he had spoilt a good thiDg, and
made an effort to be oleaginously civil. “ His
grounds at£the were now looking delightful—
perhaps, if Mr. Blank Dash happened to be in the
neighbourhood, he would do him the pleasure of
paying him a visit —the air lovely—managed, the
other day to secure some wine imported in the
reign of Governor Macquarie— might be persuaded
to take dinner.” “Thank you,” responded the
magnificent, severely and freezingly; “I came
here to get clothes, not to be fed."

ailments, which are the result of negligence, a
.ife-long study, and can safely warrant a cure
after personal consultation. Carelessness in many
cases has brought about a state of weakness that
has reduced the general system so much as to in-
duce almost every other disease, and the real
cause of this scarely ever beiDg suspected, people
have been doctored for everything but the right
one. Notwithstanding the many valuable remedies
that medical science has produced for the relief of
this class of patients, none of the ordinary modes
of treatment effect a oure. During my extensive
hospital and private practice in England, I have
discovered new and concentrated remedies, and
with the use of my extensive Oalvdnic Appliances,
am in a position to guarantee a cure in every case
undertaken. Consultation costs nothing, and I
will tell you at once whether your case is curable
