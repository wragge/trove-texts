FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes. 1
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

ADVICE
TO

MEN:
“After a lifelong experience I find
that advertising in the morning papers
is simply throwing so many million
dollars over Niagara. Most people are
too busy to read the Advertisements in
the morning papers; in fact, it takes
them all their time to read the briefest
wires.... To my mind, the best news-
papers for obtaining good results are
the Sunday papers. When a busy man
gets hold of a Sunday paper he has
plenty of leisure to read it through from
start to finish — Advertisements and all.
And lie invariably does it.”

medium in Western Australia is

circulation greater than a Daily.

HIS BOOKS
Topical Biographies
The works reviewed below deserve to
be read if only because they provide
answers of a sort to questions which are
agitating thousands of Australians. The
first, though entitled The Autobiography
of Alice B. Toklas (John Lane;
Hymock’s ; Bs. 6d.), is as much a bio-
gpphy as the other. Gertrude Stein, the
high priestess of Modernism, wrote it to
advertise herself and her friends.
x J° hn Hampden, by Hugh Ross
Williamson (Hodder and Stoughton ■
Dymock’s; 12s. 6d.), is the first life of
this great enemy of tyrannies that has
appeared in England for over a century.
It comes appositely now when most civi-
lised countries, including Australia, are
afflicted with tyrannies of one kind and
another.
Portrait of a Critic
The American Gertrude Stein was an
inevitable Modernist from the day she
first arrived in France about 30 years
ago. She had failed in her medical
examinations, but she had a private in-
come ; and she soon found her metier in
Paris : that of posing as an authority on
art, literature, the drama, and eventually
the movies. She had never painted a
picture or had a book published or a
play produced when she began her criti-
cal career. In her own words, she “is
not efficient.”
On the other hand, she was self-
assured, quick to pick up the jargon
of the ateliers, affluent relatively to her
new friends, and she had a winning per-
sonality and a tremendous zest for life
and social intercourse. Her brusque,
jolly, arrogant charm, which has been
compared to Melba’s, is felt at once by
everybody who comes across her. She
is, of course, a past-mistress of the art of
self-advertisement.
She met Cezanne through the dealer
Vollard, who was one of the first to
boom him ; and she brought Matisse and
Picasso together.
Matisse and Picasso chose each one of the
other one the picture that was undoubtedly the
least interesting either of them had done. Later
each one used it as an example the picture
they had chosen of the weakness of the other
one.
She fraternised with and pontificated
about them all—lmpressionists, Neo- and
Post-Impressionists, Cubists, Futurists,
Vorticists, Realists, Surrealists and many
more.
Her weakness as a critic—due no
doubt to her lack of technical know-
ledge—is her instability. An inno-
vation nearly always arouses her enthu-
siasm at first. She “got interested by the
work of a French painter, Fabre ; but
he came to nothing.” She thought
Masson had a future, but “Masson fell
under the influence of the Surrealists.”
And so on. Her fallen favorites used to
ask angrily why she had changed her
opinion of them, but she could only
afiswer that, so far as she was concerned,
their works had “faded into the wall. ’
Meanwhile her opinions, delivered with
an impressive show of authority, had
benefited a number of incompetent artists
ahd shrewd dealers, and induced her
admirers to buy rubbish.
There is a lesson here for Australia.
Miss Stein’s prose style may be judged
by the quoted reference to Matisse and
Picasso, and her poetry is equally repeti-
tive and ungrammatical. Modernistic
English of this description suffers from
the same defect as most modernistic art.
Its devotees make a virtue of sloppiness.
Exchange of Tyrannies
Mr. Williamson virtually begins his
biography with a picture of England
as it was in 1613, when Hampden had
come down from Oxford and started
to read at the Temple, and when James
had begun the Crown’s long struggle
with Coke by “promoting” him to the
King’s Bench. Inside 11 years Hampden
had married and been returned to Par-
liament, and Charles had succeeded to
the throne.
Charles is depicted as a negative
being whose chastity was due to
the same cause as
his “incurable in-
dolence,” namely,
unde r-vitality;
who turned to re-
ligion and art as
escapes from life,
and whose proud reticence was merely
lt hardly seems to square
with the character of one who, aided
only by Laud arid a few timeserving
judges, put up a long struggle against
some of the ablest Parliamentarians Eng-
land has had, and who died with fear-
less dignity.
Charles derived his moral force from
the theory of the “divine right of kings,”
which was accepted as unquestioningly
in the seventeenth century as we accept
the divine right of democracy. Cromwell
“cried ashamedly” in the House at the
idea of challenging it; so did stern old
Coke, and Hampden “needed all his self-
control to keep himself in check.”
Ship money was merely the culmina-
tion of a series of exactions, each of
which assumed—and logically, if there
was anything in “divine right”—that the
King was competent “to gather the same
sum, ten, twelve or a hundred times re-
doubled, when and as often as he
pleased.” For denying this right Hamp-
den, amongst other inherent loyalists,
went to war with the King, and was
killed.
In many ways the seventeenth-century
electors who opposed Charles’s exactions
were more favorably situated than Aus-
tralian electors are to-day. They at least
were able to deal summarily with the
oppressor. Under democratic govern-
ment Parliamentary money-grabbers are,
for practical purposes, immune. They
may pass so-called humanitarian legis-
lation (meaning, as a rule, vote-buying
legislation) and laws awarding themselves
higher salaries and more perquisites, and
the only weapon of defence available to
those who are levied on is the vote. But
the party system has made the vote value-
less for disciplinary purposes. .It doesn’t
matter if the holder of a safe seat com-
mits all the crimes in the taxpayers’
calendar provided he keeps the party
nomination ; and, since most ramps at the
public’s expense are put through with the
connivance of all the parties, he keeps the
nomination, and has nothing to fear.
It is a solemn thought that, whereas
Charles I. lasted only 17 years before the
English rose against him and his levies,
Austialian politicians have been pursuing
similar methods for over a quarter of a
century in perfect safety.

The Russian Realists
Ivan Bunin, the recipient of this year’
Nobel Prize for literature, was born
1870, ten years after Chekhov, and there
fore dates from the peak period in Rus
sian literature. The curve started on it
upward climb barely 100 years ago with
Gogol’s “Dead Souls.” Before Gogol’
time there was no tradition of Slav art
A tradition can be a paralysing
thing. Human beings have an enormou
capacity for reverence. When a grea
artist or a group of great artists establish
a new set of values it seems to their sue
cessors something final and absolute
The awe of the conservative populace
invests it with a mystical and sacred
radiance. Academies arise to ensure its
preservation from decay. Orthodox
criticism makes it the sole criterion oi
living art, applauding the living artis
aC i C -°[ dlng to tIie de § ree of fidelity with
which he reiterates what has already been
said by the giants of the past This
reiteration is regarded as good taste ; a
new statement, particularly a better state-
ment, is stigmatised as bad form, lack of
refinement, poor style.

(1809-52) gave the direction to his suc-

stream that flowed from Gogol’s pen and
did not share in its development.
Dostoieffsky (1828-81) was as great
a realist as Gogol, but whereas Gogol
turned his objective eye on the decaying
soul of Russia as revealed in the Russian
village, in the dull oppressiveness of the
bureaucrat and the psychic confusion of

MADE IN ENGLAND
OF ALL DEALERS
the intellectual, Dostoieffsky turned his
eye inwards and found all the actors in
this religious drama of suffering in him-
self. Tolstoy, too. But that great
genius’s sensitiveness was so acute, his
perception so profound, that the spectacle
of man’s inhumanity to man filled him
with that nausea which is the artist’s
greatest danger. He became a reforming
moralist.
In the ’nineties there was a galaxy of
writers —Korolenko, Garshin, Ertel, Solo-
gub, Cherikof,. Kuprin—all reflecting the
Gogol tradition in a greater or less
degree. It seemed as if everything had
been said that could be said ; writers were
beginning to generalise, to reiterate; it
seemed that Russian literature was al-
ready starting to decline into conservat-
ism. Chekhov, a Zemstvo doctor, rescued
it and took it to greater altitudes.
Russian proletarian writers are inclined
to view Chekhov patronisingly to-day.
To them he seems to lack an active pro-
pagandising faith. They cannot see that,
where wish-fulfilment creeps into art,
there is not a gain but a terrible loss.
Chekhov saw that Russian literature
had hitherto been too diffuse. He
avoided the novel of characteristically
enormous length and concentrated on the
particular. In a series of amazing short
stories and plays not quite so meritorious
he defined the immediate impression. He
eschewed all theorising and moralistic
preaching, leaving those branches of
thought to their own specialists. He
maintained that the literary artist was
himself a specialist. The job of the writer
was to listen and observe, to select the
significant evidence and discard the
irrelevant, to place one fact against
another in their correct relationship ;in
short, to sum up as a judge, leaving the
verdict to the jury, the. reader. The artist,
he said, states problems; he does not
provide solutions: and in “Moujiks,”
“The Duel” and a hundred other stories
Chekhov stated problems incomparably.
The consequence of this objectivity
was a panorama of Russian society so
vivid, so appallingly true, that the verdict
of the jury could never be in doubt.
Such a condition of things must be
changed. The political specialists duly
applied their solution —the Russian
Revolution.
Chekhov depicted a society in which
every instinct of the individual was frus-
trated. He did not say to what that
frustration was due or how it could be
removed. He left that to the young pro-
letarian writers of to-day, of whom
Gorky, himself a contemporary of Chek-
hov, is the guiding star. Anew and
seductive element —wish-fulfilment —has
crept into Russian literature. The modern
writer sees things not as they are but as
he would like them to be, though a few,
like Valentine Kataev, are beginning to
strike the authentic Chekhov-note anew.
Bunin, the anti-Bolshevist, the winner
of the Nobel Prize, is only an echo from
the long ago.
SPASEBO.
Some Impertinent Blighter
Has written the blurb for the new
Endeavour Press novel, The Doughman,
by Robert Desmond Tate. He wants to
know “Why has the life with which this
novel deals been passed over by Aus-
tralian writers?”
The Doughman deals with a bit of
industrial life. There are no goats or
goannas, no gum-trees, no starving sheep.
The action is confined to a bakehouse.
There are a dozen or so characters. There
is the master, Tunk—vociferously honest,
shrewd, abrupt; addicted to maudlin
sentiment in the presence of crushed
mice. There is Martin, the Loader—a
decent chap, temperamentally unfitted
for the setting, psychologically incapable
of getting out of it. There are two office
girls—one a wanton ; the other so pure
that she smells of soap. That Com-
munist-feared and capitalist-exploited
mainprop of industry Loyalty to the Job
is personified in Ned the Foreman. There
are a sneak-thief carter, and the yard’s
sheik, and some others.
That’s how it is at the beginning—
master and workers getting along reason-
ably well in a sound, decent enough
place. Then, virtually synchronising, the
honest Tunk falls to the temptation of
buying a consignment of rotten flour, and
the Doughman arrives. A queer cus-
tomer, this Doughman—uncanny, creepy,
elusive, sinister, sardonic; a sort of
Wandering Jew of the dough-punching
world. With his coming the rot sets in,
literally. It spreads—an infection called
rope—through the bread ; it gets into the
character of the workers and plays the
deuce with them ; even the Bathtub Girl
is not above faking the books and pinch-
ing another lady’s husband.
In its theme and general nature the
novel is a bold, dramatic conception-
melodramatic in places—working up to
a spectacular climax, with the purging of
all this corruption by the only possible
means—by fire. Thinking it over, in its
graphic vividness, its sterling character-
drawing (especially of Tunk), its clear
synthesis of elementals of a section of
industrial life....
Hullo! We’re back with that blighter
who wrote the blurb! Well, lam going
to take a risk. I am going to answer his
question, and then I’m going to step from
under.
The life with which this novel deals —
the industrial life —has been passed over
by Australian writers because that is the
easiest thing to do with it, and because
goats and goannas and their habitual
associates and surroundings are less com-
plex, and therefore easier, than the inten-
sity of industry, and its setting, and its
thwarted, frustrated people.
I’d say to this, and to all such inquisi-
tive blurb-writers: Give the boys a
chance. Hang it all, they’ve only been
taking the line of least resistance. This
fellow Tate ought to be execrated in-
stead of applauded. The Australian writ-
ing industry was a decent, sober, well-
mannered institution, if obscure. What
does he want cornin’ round the joint
throwin’ spanners into the bloomin’
works? What does he want writin’ a
novel with the stuff of life in it?
CECIL MANN.
Back to Victoria?
No axiom of history is more frequently
true than that men revolt against their
fathers and make friends of their grand-
fathers. With us the process has already
begun.
The Edwardians who begat us are
discredited. Morally, they have shown
themselves bankrupt, intellectually they
have been inadequate, even physically
they have been shamed ; compared with
our methods in these things, their sport-
ing spectacles were like the efforts of
some British province when set beside a
display of Imperial Rome. Their ideas
of economics, like their hats, seem
quaint. They seem so because they no
longer have any relation to things of
the present day.
That the Edwardian age was a time of
achievement in the arts makes no differ-
ence. The blossoming poets died (who
can calculate how much poorer we are
by the deaths of Brooke and Flecker?),
the new cleanness of Lutyens was
drowned in the clamor surrounding, a
New York which was growing more and
more vertical, the architectonic effects
of Elgar (ripe harvest of the richness of
an Empire that garnered the yield of an
earth) passed into the bypaths of Bartok.
Strange new stirrings were heard. The
tremendous disillusion of the war paral-
leled the tremendous shock to fixed ideas
which came in the guise of extended
knowledge in the decades after 1880. But
now Einstein had replaced Darwin,
Lenin replaced Henry George, Aldous
Huxley replaced Bergson. Nothing was
immune.
As physics wavered before Einstein
and the Newtonian universe fell to
pieces, so psychology shifted front to
take cognisance of the influence of the
endocrine glands. The newer biology
was fraught with the destructive power
of dynamite. Before it the artists fled
to their ivory towers or shifted in turn
to make a different, sharper, acrid world.
The old influences were spent. Drama-
tists of genius, like O’Neill, rejecting con-
temptuously the outworn conventions of
theatrical reality, were creating piays like
“Lazarus Laughed,” “The Machine
Wreckers” or “The Last Night of Don
Juan.” The poets were even more adven-
turous. Mr. Swinburne’s rhythms were
nothing like as complex as those devised
by such a respected citizen as Robert
Bridges ; Mr. Swinburne’s frankness was
exceeded on a score of sides. The real-
isation dawned that there were two Vic-
torian ages: that which produced Samuel
Smiles and that which was marked by
the rise of a new critical spirit, the days
of Dickens and the days of Shaw. Sym-
pathy with the period extended to the
stage of reviving its lighter moments.
Ping-pong bats were wielded again, and
knitting needles clicked. Corsets (magicked
by the new name “foundation garment”)
reappeared.
And the new freedom of women
brought in its train a desire for the old
manners. The political ambitions of the
older generation had been realised and
found wanting, but the opposition of
men to women, sharpened now by a real
threat of economic competition, kept
many in the old paths. The “three-
decker” novel, so long assumed to be
dead because of the demands of this
hurried age, swiftly reappeared. The
ideals of decoration of the Pre-Raphael-
ites, inadequately echoed in our fathers’
time by Roger Fry, were restated and
heightened by an Australian, Raymond
McGrath. Transmuted by the decades
between, even the bustle was found to
be a modish revival.
Along with these ephemera went an
acceptance of the new mechanical world,
acknowledgment that the Brooklyn
Bridge possessed a new beauty in its
time, and that that beauty was repeating
itself to-day. The New Regent-street,
it was seen, had the merit of New Scot-
land Yard of 40 years ago. In the welter
of modern confusion there was forging
a new strength, an integration of social
forces. Side by side with the consolida-
tion of such Victorian movements as the
religious one at Oxford came a belief
that the chaos of broken faiths and de-
stroyed ideas was leaving the ground
clear for creative building.
In the outcome the Victorian revival
may mean a restoration of the Vic-
torians’ confidence in themselves and in
the new world they would make.
QUENTIN POPE.
Australian Films
It is all to the good that Australian
studios should be making Australian
films. But the emphasis must be on the
films, not on the Australian. In other
words, directors in choosing material
should choose it, not because it is Aus-
tralian, but because it can be filmed.
Otherwise they will simply repeat a mis-
take that has been made time and again
by the American studios—that of buying
up without adequate consideration the
film rights of best-selling novels.
“The Sentimental Bloke” should serve
as a warning. It is Australian—indeed,
for many it is the Australian classic ;
and there are ample possibilities of en-
tertainment latent in the theme. But
the picture never comes within coo-ee
of greatness. Its weakest moments are
that in which the director remembers
that he is screening Dennis’s book.
No director could make a great film
of “The Sentimental Bloke.” “The
Sentimental Bloke” means Dennis;
and Dennis’s theme is essentially liter-
ary. His book is not the simple
story of Bill and Doreen, but that story
transmuted by its passage through the
mind of the Bloke. And this is not
material for a film —it can’t be treated
plastically. The film clearly shows this.
The director has been frequently com-
pelled to superimpose literary subtitles
upon the action—a downright confession
of failure. For such devices are not
natural to the medium; they distract the
attention of the onlooker and disturb
the flow of the film.
If our directors must use subjects
with “Australian” written large all
over them, they can go to the gold
rushes, where they will find a wealth of
cinematic material. But, better still, let
them cease to be self-consciously Aus-
tralian and concentrate upon the busi-
ness °f producing good films. If they
Australians with an Australian view-
Pp int 1? express, let them but make their
hlms sincerely: the Australian element

A Satchel of Books
Devil’s Drums, by Vivian Meik (Philip
Allan ; 2s. 6d.). Uniform with “Creeps,”
“Horrors” and similar v/orks which aim
at making cold shudders run down the
reader’s spine. This one is about Africa
and the hideous tortures inflicted by
some of its natives on those who incur
their displeasure.
Giants and Pigmies of the Deep is
another of the Shakespeare Head nature
books published under the editorship of
David Stead. It includes racy stories and
accurate descriptions of sharks, the killers
of Twofold Bay, sucker fish, “Pelorus
Jack,” eels, sunfish, the sea serpent and
the great sea bat. The book is copiously
illustrated. It will answer its immediate
purpose as a textbook for senior school
pupils and teachers. It should also be
a welcome companion for fishermen, old
and young.
A Rose for Scotland, by A. T. Shep-
pard and Roderick Macleod (Hodder and
Stoughton; 7s. 6d.). The author of
“Here Comes an Old Sailor” has joined
a knowledgeable collaborator in writing
a novel about a few weeks of history—
Margaret Tudor’s journey to Scotland to
wed King James. After some of the
sloppy so-called historical yarns which
are churned inaccurately off the presses
these days, this one is a delight. It is
very evidently based on careful and de-
tailed research, but the author’s learn-
ing is never allowed to become obtrusive
and the pictures of the romantic and
colorful side of sixteenth-century life do
not cloy. A romance well done, easy to
read and educative enough to remember.

AVIATION AND THE TORTOISE.
In a sense, Australia was the cradle of
flying in heavier-than-air machines. Had
it not been for Hargrave, aeroplanes
would not have come so early. The
Wrights acknowledged their debt to the
inventor of the box-kite. The Smith-
sonian Institute sent Dr. Graham Bell,
inventor of. the telephone, to Australia
to secure Hargrave’s models, only to find
that the best of them, scorned in his
own country, had been grabbed by the
great mechanical museum in Munich.
Since then we have produced the
world’s greatest fliers—Ross Smith,
Kingsford Smith, Hinkler, Jerry Pent-
land. For most of them, we can’t find
work outside a little barnstorming. We
have, also, produced some of the greatest
of designers. Hawker was one, Edgar
Percival another. Australia lost both ;
but it has kept the Civil Aviation
Department.
The Civil Aviation Department has just
issued a triennial report, in which it
expresses itself delighted with the work
which it carries on under the Eegis of
Mr. Pearce. It is especially pleased with
its plans for revolutionising Australian
flying.
Astounding is the only word to describe
these plans. They have been mapped out
so as not to interfere with the work of
the great Australian obstructionists whose
genius is lodged in various railway
departments, and who have arranged in
some States that any enterprising com-
mercial flying company which carries a
few passengers and a little pocket-hand-
kerchief freight along or near a railway
line shall be taxed out of existence. The
single aerial commercial service which
exists in N. S. Wales to-day survives be-
cause it gets a postal subsidy, and because
it travels inter-State and thus outwits the
State taxgatherers. Westralian Airways,
which looks after the Perth-Adelaide and
Perth-Derby-Wyndham routes, has man-
aged to live, as also have Qantas and
Lasco, which serve the back country of
Queensland.
The back country of N.S.W. has no
services. Sydney and Melbourne and
Adelaide are not connected by air-
lines ; flying from Melbourne to Sydney
is regarded as “dangerous” because there
is some mountainous country between,
though men fly over the Rockies and the
Alps and Carpathians. But Tasmania is
joined to the mainland by three services,
one of which flies an up-to-date seven-
passenger Dragon-Moth, an ideal
machine for Australian conditions. There
are, as well, a couple of unsubsidised
coastal services in Queensland and South
Aus. The rest is a blank.
This blank the Civil Aviation Depart-
ment proposes to fill by trunk connec-
tions from the Singapore-Australia link
with Imperial Airways routes. The main
lines in the scheme will run as much
through desert and as far from the
cherished railway lines as possible. In
the east, one route goes from Darwin to
Charleville, thence to Brisbane. In N. S.
Wales the terminal will be Cootamundra
—it was chosen against the advice of
most private flying men. In the west, the
Katherine will be joined to Perth via
the Kimberleys. Then a Melbourne-
Hobart service via King Island is to be
subsidised along with two others —from
Cloncurry to Normanton and from
Ord River to Wyndham. If any fool
wants to get to Melbourne or Adelaide
after having flown from London to
Cootamundra, let him patronise Mr. Har-
tigan’s trains, and Mr. Clapp’s. If he
desires to fly to Sydney direct he must
go round by Brisbane so as to pay the
largest possible fare. In the words of
the Civil Aviation Department, the new
programme is to
(1) Provide air transport facilities for mails,
passengers and goods between London and the
Australian capitals on a 16-17 day schedule.
. (2) Retain and extend the air transport facili-
ties now enjoyed by residents of W.A., North
Australia and Queensland.
(3) Provide a permanent air-mail link between
Tasmania and the mainland....
Rip Van Winkle would have been
delighted with this Civil Aviation Depart-
ment, and the tortoise would call it
brother. The distance across the U.S.A.
is 3000 miles. A mail pilot has crossed in
10 hours 47 minutes. Mail ’planes with
an average speed of over 200 m.p.h. are
already being put on the trans-U.S.A.
run, and it is predicted that within the
next three years 250 m.p.h. will be nearer
the average. The K.N.I.L.M. —the Dutch
line—has had an eight-day service from
Amsterdam to Java and contemplates
cutting it to days with the fast new
Ponder machine and night-flying. But
none of this hurry for Mr. Pearce and
his minions! Never let it be said that
they are anything but grandmotherly.
The Spirit of Fun, when it was here
last year, flew from Adelaide to Wynd-
ham via Alice Springs—l64o miles —In
7 hours 30 minutes, and then left imme-
diately for Sourabaya. Its speed was
roughly 220 m.p.h. On that basis the
Singapore-Darwin flight would take
10-j hours; the distance is 2333 miles
by air. The Katherine would be brought
within 10 hours of Perth; Cootamundra
within 12 hours of Darwin; London
—with night-flying, in which the Ameri-
can services indulge—within a comfort-
able 60 hours of Melbourne.
But none of these things for Mr.
Pearce. Seventeen days to London seems
real speed to him even when Kingsford
Smith can do the trip in 7 days 4j
hours in a tiny single-engined ’plane.
As the department says itself, the journey
to England by air has become “little more
than a holiday jaunt.”
With such an authority in charge
of Australian air affairs, thinking in days
when the rest of the world is thinking
in hours, is it any wonder that pas-
senger figures for the first half of 1933
show a drop from 1932 figures and
machine miles flown were fewer in 1932
than in 1930? In Britain, mileage flown
has doubled since 1928, number of pas-
sengers carried has trebled and mail
carriage almost doubled —this exclusive
of hire-taxi services. Yet, per head of
population, there are more “A” pilots on
issue in Australia than in Britain.
New Guinea shows us the way. There
are 21 aerodromes and landing-grounds
in the Mandated Territory. Four aerial
services with 21 machines connect the
small town of Bulolo with the coast, as
interior Australian towns should be con-
nected. In 1931 and 1932, although they
serve a route maximum of 70 air-miles,
these services flew 876,000 miles, against
2,000,000 miles in Australia. They car-
ried to and from one small goldfield
8,802,0001 b. of freight last year against
232,0001 b. carried by the Australian ser-
vices. Bulolo-Lae-Salamaua passengers
doubled in two years, while Australia’s
fell off 25 per cent.
The Bulletin suggests that the follow-
ing Defence Department requisition
should be issued without delay:
Bombs, Mills, one, to put under Civil
Aviation Branch.
Care should, of course, be taken to
remove all troglodytes, snails and old
women to a place of safety before the
pin is pulled out.
TAKEN TO TASK.
The Bulletin has been thanked by
South Australian barley-growers and
North Westralian cattlemen for trying to
avert the loss of their Belgian market,
endangered by the resentment of the
Belgian Government at our embargo on
imports of sheet-glass. A different note
has been struck by a Victorian who
writes from Maldon. Abuse taken out,
his letter boils down to this:
Belgium is forced to buy barley from outside
We are not forced to buy their or any other
country’s surplus manufactures. What is the
sense of sending raw material to a country
that will do worse than not pay at all by
filling us with stuff we can make ourselves?
Let them pay in gold unless they can give
us a raw material that can be finished here
in the same way that they want to do with
ours. If they can’t pay in gold far better to
give it to them.
And who is to do the giving? The
growers of the barley and the beef? The
States in which they live, and which
are already dissatisfied—in some respects
justly—with their treatment under the
Federation? The general body of tax-
payers? Australian Glass, perhaps.
Certainly Australian Glass could contri-
bute substantially towards the proposed
gift if it felt that way inclined. Its net
profits for 1932-33 were declared at
£122,439, after an unspecified allowance
for “depreciation, etc.,” had been included
in its expenditure. In the distribution of
the £122,439 it handed £83,743 to ordinary
shareholders and £15,750 to preference
shareholders, and added £22,946 to re-
serves, making nominal reserves £506,087.
During the ten years to March, 1933, pre-
ference shareholders got a steady 9 p.c. ;
ordinary shareholders received 10 p.c.
for five successive years, 12i p.c. in 1929
and 1930 (yes, even 1930), 6 p.c. in 1931,
7i p.c. in 1932 and 9 p.c. this year.
Profits since 1925, after deduction of
£15,750 for the prefs., have been reckoned
at 16.3 p.c., 17.6 p.c., 18.2 p.c., 20.6 p.c.,
18.4 p.c., 6.5 p.c., 8.2 p.c. and 11.4 p.c.;
and this is not the whole story. Substan-
tial additions have been made to fixed
assets and paid for out of earnings ; and,
thanks also to earnings, the book value
of fixed assets (the substantial additions
notwithstanding) has been reduced by
£230,660 in nine years. The ordinaries
are £1 shares. The market price
ranged between 545. and 60s. in August,
1929; it is 495. now. It would be safe
to wager that this company’s actual
profits are 50 p.c. greater than those of
all the barley- and beef-growers menaced
by the Belgian reply to the concession so
accommodatingly granted to it.
Belgium is far from “filling us with
stuff that we can make ourselves.” In
1931-32, The latest year for which details
are available, it imported Australian
barley valued at £316,819, whereas its
whole exports to Australia were valued
at £282,131, sheet-glass accounting for a
whole £3229. In the same year it bought
£71,642 worth of Westralian beef for its
army—the cattle are slaughtered and
frozen at the Wyndham meatworks, a
State Government enterprise. It is almost
the only overseas purchaser for South
Australian barley and North Westralian
beef. There are lots of barley and frozen
beef in the world, and it seems reason-
able to suppose that its preference for
these Australian articles has been influ-
enced in some measure by friendship.
And the friendship of a country which
in the last five recorded years bought
£31,675,000 worth of Australian produce
is surely worth cultivating.
There might have been something to
say for the embargo on sheet-glass had
it been imposed in the desperate emerg-
ency of 1930-31 ; but it dates from .Sep-
tember 23, 1932. During the two pre-
ceding years imports of Belgian sheet-
glass were valued at £9487. According
to the general manager of Australian
Glass, the “prohibition was temporarily
necessary to save the Australian indus-
try at a critical period.” His company’s
balance sheets do not support the state-
ment. His company may fairly ask to
be put in the way of holding its own
with overseas competitors, and its his-
tory shows that it has been placed in
that position. It has no right to a pro-
hibition that may mean stark ruin to
such men as the men at the back of
Wyndham, who have written one of the
grandest chapters in our history.
The Bulletin stands for Protection,
but not for restricting its benefits to
the Big Cities. It has no patience with
the fiscal prohibitionist who would add
to the riches of makers of bottles, bis-
cuits, headache tablets and chocolate
creams regardless of the consequences
to struggling land men. It will be no
party to imperilling back-country indus-
tries for the sake of a concern like Aus-
tralian Glass.
SEVENPENCE A QUART.
Sydney has had a Health and Milk Week,
during which rousing speeches were made
on the need for drinking more milk.
Lord Mayor Hagon could not under-
stand why Sydney people drank only half
a pint per individual per day when Lon-
doners drank a whole pint and Scandi-
navians a pint and a half. Dr. Sandford
Morgan said that the milk bill should
amount to at least ss. of every pound
spent on food. “Give your children a
quart a day up to the age of six years,
and at least a pint a day until they are
18,” said Dr. Purdy.
Workingmen’s wives could explain to
these enthusiasts in a sentence why what
they advise is almost impossible to fami-
lies whose breadwinner is on the State
basic wage of £3 6s. 6d. a week, and
quite impossible where he is on the dole.
Since Lang set up a board to control the
metropolitan milk supply, the retail price
has been sevenpence a quart. And the
trade celebrated Health and Milk Week
by deciding that sevenpence should be the
minimum price!
Thirteen pence a gallon is paid to
farmers; Is. sd. by vendors. For
upwards of 18 months these rates have
ruled ; and during that period the price
of nearly every other commodity has
come down. Sydney has seen Egg Board
eggs, guaranteed “new-laid, first-grade,”
fall to Bd. a dozen, and eggs without the
official brand to 6d. Factory butter, on
which the farmer pays a levy of 3d. a
pound, has dropped to Is. 2d. a pound ;
“farm” butter to Is. There have been
three cuts in the State basic wage. State
and Commonwealth taxes have been re-
duced. But milk is still sevenpence a
quart.
A 1 milk? Well—perhaps. Shand,
K.C., who was commissioned to inquire
into the administration of the Milk Act,
1931, and to trace the associated smells
to their source, reported that all the
board’s agents, except the Woodstock
co., had violated the Pure Food Act,
which says :
An article of food is adulterated when it is
mixed or diluted with any substance of lower
commercial value than such article in pure or
normal state; when any valuable constituent of
the article has been wholly or in part abstracted.
In their own charming expression they
“standardised” the milk. The Singleton
co. “standardised” it by “abstracting the
cream,” and (in company with Mc-
Namaras and Fresh Food and Ice) by
“running separated milk into milk in-
tended for consumption.” Dairy Farmers’
Co-op. had an “equally effective method.”
When the milk arrives in vats on railway
trucks they pump the lower and weaker con-
tents into other milk intended for consumption
and then pump the upper layer for separation
for cream.
The Singleton co. “has made probably
about £3OOO from ‘standardisation’ ” ;
Fresh Food and Ice, between £l5OO and
£2000; McNamaras about the same.
McNamaras, moreover,
Sold bottled milk with a stopper inscribed
“Rich Milk for Babies”.... It was the ordinary
milk.
“Very serious breaches were com-
mitted” by this McNamara concern. It
complained to the Bowthorne co-op. that
inferior milk was being supplied, and it
was arranged, by way of compensation,
that McNamaras should receive Bow-
thorne milk at 9d. a gallon, instead of
Is. Id. Hence “false returns were made
to the board for several months” by Mc-
Namaras, and “false entries” were made
in the McNamara and Bowthorne books.
The Commissioner found further that
all the agents, except Fresh Food and
Ice, “have committed breaches either of
the Milk Act or of their agency agree-
ments,” notably with regard to cream.
Dairy Farmers bought 35,000 gallons from
three South Coast suppliers. The Railway
Department allows cans of cream to be car-
ried between the vats free of cost, and Dairy
Farmers by their breach of the law gained a
very considerable sum.
Dairy Farmers paid 6s. 3d. a gallon
for the cream which the insolvent Gov-
ernment railways brought to Sydney free ;
the price to the householder is 7d. per
quarter-pint.
There must be heaps of money in the
milk business. Seemingly a lot was flying
round before this board arrived. A Lang
Minister had made a stir by attacking
what he called the Macarthur Onslow in-
terest. He, nevertheless, went to the Mac-
arthur Onslow interest for a board chair-
man, appointing one Hamilton, who had
been joint manager of Dairy Farmers
with one Haddin. The appointment of the
board was approved by Cabinet on
December 28, 1931. Investigation
showed that “from December 29 on-
wards large sums of money belonging
to the company had been made available
to themselves by the joint managers.”
It was alleged that these moneys were used
in payment of special cash rebates to cus-
tomers At the inquiry.... Mr. Hamilton
named some 40 persons to whom he believed
he had paid such rebates All, except two
absentees, were called, and, with the exception of
three, denied that they had received rebates....
A large portion of the sum of £3500 was not
spent by the managers in the way they have
indicated, but... .there is no evidence before me
to prove this money was applied corruptly.
A good deal was said at the inquiry
about a sum of £lOOO collected
from members of the Metropolitan
Dairymen’s Association “with the idea
of enabling inquiries to be made into
the correctness of rumors of corruption
in the appointment of the board.” The
Commissioner finds that “this money was
raised and paid away” for a purpose
which neither the president nor the
treasurer was “willing to disclose.”
The annual milk requirements of the
metropolitan district are estimated at 24
million gallons, of which one-fourth is
provided by metropolitan dairies. The
balance of 18 million gallons comes from
country districts, which, though limited
in number (for some reason or other
the rich North Coast is excluded), could
furnish 56 million gallons. If they
were allowed to supply at full capacity,
the retail price could be reduced at least
2d. a quart; then Drink More Milk cam-
paigns would not be shams. As things
are, supplies are restricted, milk is wasted,
the retail price is maintained at an out-
rageous figure, and the smells remain.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
“On an Acreage Basis.”
Watchers of the wheat situation cer-
tainly get action for their money. Every
day the gentlemen at Canberra turn from
one palliative to another. Sir Henry
Deterding has said that simplicity is a
mark of a great brain, and the great
brains of the U.A.P. have proved it, for
they have boiled down the wheat pro-
blem to an elementary question:
Which scheme will earn or save us most votes
at the general election?
First, the Government inclined to the
Pprkins sales tax on flour. Then com-
munion with party members suggested
that the rural cave and the C.P. might
force the rate of tax too high, and con-
tact with Labor opposition left it with
the fear of a bread-price election issue.
So the Prime Minister rushed to the
Commonwealth Bank and arranged a
loan. Then, with country members cry-
ing that the amount provided would be
not enough, and with Jupiter Pluvius in-
tervening to intensify farmers’ need, a
back-to-the-flour-tax movement set in. At
the week-end a typical Lyons compromise
was announced —a flour tax of £4 ss. a
ton, together with another sixpence a
pound on tobacco-leaf and odds and
ends of other special taxes. The com-
munique added:—
Whatever plan is finally adopted it seems
probable that payments to growers will be made
in proportion to acreage sown.
This is not equitable. If £3,000,000 is
spent, as is suggested, it will work out
at about 4s. per acre, which will be given
to good and bad farmers alike. It will
be given likewise to wheatgrowers in
Queensland, who don’t produce for ex-
port and who (having received a
fixed price every year) have not
shared in the hardships of farmers in
the four exporting States —their wheat is
virtually excluded from Queensland, in
spite of the constitutional provision for
inter-State Freetrade. It would be far
better to pay so much a bushel where the
grower has received less than 2s. 9d. at
siding, and reserve portion of the fund
for farmers in all six States whose crops
have suffered through “the act of God” —
too little rain or too much, rust, smut or
anything of the sort.
Article 6 of the International Wheat
Agreement reads:
The Governments signing this instrument —
(1) Agree henceforth not to encourage any
extension of the area sown to wheat and not
to take.. ..any measures... .to increase domes-
tic production of wheat.
If a bonus distributed on an acreage
basis isn’t an invitation to extend area
sown to wheat, what is it?

Wireless and the Constitution.
Within 30 seconds, a London newspaper
says, the Admiralty is now able to send
a danger signal to any vessel anywhere
on the seas. There are some vessels to
which it can’t send messages, even
though radio has become so essential at
sea that even Chinese junks fit it. Those
vessels are on the Australian coast, and
the blessed Constitution guards their
owners from the need to instal this ordi-
nary safety device.
On vessels which pass State border-
lines the Commonwealth can compel the
use of radio, but where the ships con-
cerned keep within the coastal limit of
single States “it is impossible to give
effect” to Commonwealth rompulsions
without the aid of the States concerned.
Yet wireless services in Australia are
under the control of tlra Commonwealth,
and the States have no wireless staffs
or facilities whatever.
It seems time this Australia really be-
came a nation and cut out some of the
expensive circ-rxnlocution.

The Double-tax Swindle.
Since 1&30 the N.S.W. Taxation Depart-
ment has claimed unemployed-relief tax
at tbtt rate of Is. in the £ on income
derived by N.S.W. residents from other
States. Not on what reaches their hands
after the ordinary and special Common-
wealth taxes on property income and the
local income and unemployed-relief taxes
have been deducted, but 5 p.c. on the
gross.
It was hoped that the Stevens Govern-
ment would abandon this extortion in its
Special Income and Wages Tax Manage-
ment Bill, which lumped together the two
imposts previously collected. Instead, its
Assistant Treasurer Spooner, while allow-
ing that “hardships are created by the
taxation in two States of income earned
in one State,” said nothing more than
that reciprocal legislation would be intro-
duced if it could strike a bargain with
other States. Then he proceeded to add
a section requiring companies registered
in N. S. Wales to deduct N.S.W. tax from
dividends due to shareholders in other
States. The same obligation rests on
N.S.W. persons who pay interest on
money lent in N. S. Wales to persons
living beyond its borders.
McKellar White, the new president of
the Federated Taxpayers’ Associations, is
a Sydney man. He suggested that the
Victorian association should lodge a pro-
test against Spooner’s section. It has
done so to some purpose —has even sug-
gested that Victoria should retaliate with
“penal taxation of all primary produce
and all manufactured goods” from N. S.
Wales.
This is, of course, going too far, but it
illustrates the state of mind into which
men can be baited by wicked taxes.
Something ought to be done —preferably
by a gentlemen’s agreement—to do away
with this infamy of double taxation. For
one State to tax income from another
which has already borne four direct taxes
is not only grossly unjust to the victim ;
it is unneighborly and unfederal, if not
unconstitutional. It would be unconsti-
tutional for a certainty if the Constitu-
tion-makers had had foresight; but they
were men without vision and their over-
praised instrument of government is not
precise about anything.
♦
A Remedy for Grab.
From an old Parliamentary hand:
Despite popular clamor, it is not at all cer-
tain that annihilation at the polls awaits the
members who recently gave themselves a bit of
a rise. If we may judge by the history of
popular clamors over previous appropriations,
the risk the politicians are taking is negligible.
Still, whatever the risk, it, is the property and
concern of the sinners themselves. What does,
or ought to, concern us is a search for a more
satisfactory method of fixing. Parliamentary
salaries.
It is admittedly not easy to respect the grab-
bing fraternity. At the same time it is possible
that the community is itself to blame. At any
rate the community could insist that temptation
should be removed from the path of politicians.
Remedy the rot by rooting out the cause, which,
in nine cases in ten, is poverty or the fear of
poverty.
Almost every man who enters Parliament is
eager to serve his country honestly and well. He
knows, or thinks he knows, what it expects
of him, and is determined not to let it down.
Cheerfully he gives the best years of his life —
his earning years—to political duties. After three
or four Parliaments he has lost touch with his
trade or calling; new methods and new mach-
inery have very probably been introduced in the
10 or 12 years that his public service has eaten.
A vote cast in the House may displease a
section of his constituents, a less scrupulous
candidate out-promises him, and out he goes,
guiltless of possessions beyond a slender balance
in the savings bank. He is thus well and
truly on the scrap-heap —perhaps for life.
I could quote many examples of honest and
capable ex-members so served by Fate; eloquent
warnings to every present-day publicist of the
folly of being too darned honest, or too proud
to go logrolling with lifelong political enemies
in order to qualify for a share in the wriggle-
some bait. If expeditions of the sort are con-
sidered undesirable, surely some sort of a
Parliamentary pension scheme or superannua-
tion fund could be devised to meet the case.
Such a plan would materially assist in keeping
worth-while members free of party and financial
entanglements, and, with this freedom assured
to the worth-whiles, there would be little to
fear from the sticky-fingered.
Taxing Relief-works Loans.
Dog doesn’t eat dog, but Australian
Governments live on one another as far
as they can. For example, the Common-
wealth collects sales tax on goods bought
for use on State Government relief jobs.
Loud complaints about the practice
were made a few weeks ago by the Vic-
torian Government. Now it is the Syd-
ney Water and Sewerage Board’s turn.
Through the Stevens Government the
board is borrowing £2,500,000 for relief
works —mostly in overbuilt suburbs
where property owners are responsible
for a large proportion of the £2,000,000
owing in N. S. Wales for rates. It would
be a great deal more sensible to expend
the same amount in putting suitable
out-of-works on small holdings under
the scheme proposed by the shire
councils, accepted, embodied in an
Act of Parliament and then dropped ;
but that is not the point. The Gov-
ernment arranged for the loan, the
Commonwealth shares in the responsi-
bility for providing it (it was ratified by
the Loan Council), and the same Com-
monwealth is demanding £BO,OOO in sales
tax on the necessary materials. For
£BO,OOO, the board protests, it could em-
ploy 800 more men for two years.
Application to the Treasury for relief
brought the reply that remissions were
granted only where the expenditure was
borne wholly by a Government depart-
ment. Therefore, if, as in the Victorian
case, manufacturers’ association mem-
bers combine to cut costs and help the
local authorities to make their relief
money go as far as possible, there is no
exemption; but if the goods are bought
from, say, the Vic. Electricity Commis-
sion and it charges full retail rates, there
is no tax.
Most people will agree with the acting-
president of the Water Board that the
exaction of this £BO,OOO is “monstrous,”
more especially in view of the excuse
given. Mr. Casey, the Assistant Trea-
surer, says that
Owing to financial exigencies, the Govern-
ment is compelled to adhere rigidly to the
present list of exemptions.
Presumably one of the exigencies was
the voting of nearly £lO,OOO to increase
the salaries of members.
❖
What Is Censorship?
The Minister for Customs has issued a
statement which stresses the difficulties
of book censorship. The committee, says
Mr. White, himself an author, “is com-
posed of men with high qualifications
in whom the public can have every
confidence.” But these sound, judicial-
minded persons do not find their task
congenial. They are harassed by the
practice of “many writers who cloak
indecency with a high degree of literary
excellence” —with which, by the way, the
censors and their mouthpiece do not
always cloak their thoughts. Their state-
ments sometimes are written in grocery-
advertisement polysyllables.
At the same time, it is very wrong
of authors to tempt the poor fellows
with literary titbits. Vice which can be
attractive to a censor must be insidious
indeed, though surely literary excellence
should be no excuse for even a moment’s
hesitation before the damnation of the
unclean. The censor’s job is either a
moral one or it is not. Shakspeare and
Deuteronomy should not smell the
sweeter in the professorial nostril than
Norman Lindsay, who, in turn, should
not receive extra marks because he has
a better style than the lower orders of
American scribblers who are porno-
graphists, which Lindsay is not.
The whole thing becomes more and
more a farce. The book that is imported
is judged by academicians of Canberra
whose literary souls are racked by the
processes of rejection.
Anybody, however, can set up a press
next door to the censorship office and
print the volumes which the good men
spurn, and have to reckon only with the
local police. Of course, the N. S. Wales
police banned “All Quiet on the Western
Front,” thereby considerably increasing
its price and sales. It now appears boldly
and openly in almost every second-hand
shop in Sydney.
However, the tastes of the censors are
at least catholic. Some ladies who write
guides to the art of seduction without
tears get their works through without
trouble if the displays of their wares on
shop counters count for anything. And
there seems to be a rule that, since
foreigners have no morals* anything in
French, German or Italian is admissible,
even if the covers are blistered from the
internal heat. Equally, while French
papers are banned, Chinese magazines
full of lewd nudes are allowed in.
What is grossly immoral in contem-
porary English literature is clean in the
case of books 150 years old. Bookshops
are showing a de luxe, unexpurgated edi-
tion of the less careful eighteenth-cen-
tury novelists who, for ribald and deli-
berate lewdness, can give an Indian road-
side storyteller a furlong in a mile and
beat him in a canter.
Well might an innocent public ask
“What is censorship?”

Only Two Millions.
Forgan Smith, who is a Scot, and there-
fore frugal, is not going to out-Sydney
Sydney when he builds the bridge from
Petrie’s Bight to Kangaroo Point in
Brisbane. His effort will cost £2,000,000,
so he says, though in actuality it pro-
bably will cost twice as much, if Sydney
experience means anything. Sydney’s
bridge cost £10,000,000 —at least, that
was the latest estimate, although addi-
tions are made from time to time.
Two millions, of course, isn’t much.
Just enough to eat up nearly half a
year’s State taxation in a community
whose Government is crusading against
the weight of Federal taxes and had
to cadge a lot more from the Loan
Council last June to make ends look as
if they might meet. Only another £7
per head on Brisbane’s debt.
But with two millions you could equip
interior medical services 20 times over,
leaving a surplus sufficient to scatter deep-
ray therapy plants through 20 or 30 dis-
tricts, thus abating the cancer scourge.
Two millions would grade and metal
several thousand miles of road in dis-
tricts where settlers are confined to their
farms in wet weather. It would open
up a thousand farms in North Queens-
land.
None of these things seems to matter
much to Forgan Smith. He is persuaded
that Brisbane needs a bridge to span a
stream where hitherto one rowing-boat
or thereabouts has carried most of the
traffic. It will be a nice bridge—the span
will be 900 feet long, and Dr. Bradfield
will design it. What more could any
country ask of its Fount of Wisdom and
Beneficence?
—
Reappraisement of Crown Lands.
Dear Bulletin, —Those references to
the successful administration of Queens-
land lands (B. 8/11/’33) call to mind the
foundations upon which this administra-
tive machinery was built. Consider
these extracts from the Payne report of
1927: —
Economics cannot be ignored. The grazing
industry, like other industries, must be con-
ducted on a business basis. The undue sub-
division of land would inevitably lead to:
(1) A struggling class of Crown tenants, always
looking for relief whenever a dry season even-
tuates. This would cause chaos in land legis-
lation and administration.
(2) Difficulties as to finance, holdings being
overcapitalised and representing doubtful
security.
(3) The depreciation of the standard of wool,
inasmuch as the selectors could not maintain
a sufficient number of breeding ewes to permit
of culling, or have the necessary capital to
obtain good flock rams from time to time.
(4) A decline in wool output, due to the de-
preciation of fleeces and shrinkage of revenue
all round.
Compare those statements with the
actions of the Lands Department in N.
S. Wales, where many millions of acres
in the Central Division have been so
dealt with that a majority of the closer-
settlement holdings could not be fair
business undertakings except in good sea-
sons and with high prices.
There have been protests, of course;
bushels of them. They have usually been
made to a Minister who has invariably
obtained the advice of his officers as to
how to answer. Those who have tried
it have almost always found themselves
embroiled in an attempt to answer
specious argument and in a game of hide
and seek ; the Minister hides behind the
officials, the officials behind one another,
and all of them behind the Courts.
Most of the closer-settlement lease-
holds carry the right of conversion. As
the rentals are based on unimproved
capital value it can easily be seen that
sound valuation would be synonymous
with sound administration. When the
Crown Lands (Amending) Act, 1931, was
passed, most leaseholders believed that at
long last the department would have to
face the fact that either the old idea of
restricted title must go or that, in most
cases, the unimproved value was only
nominal. But the Department of Lands
willed it otherwise.
The applicant for reappraisement has
to go before a lower Court (or local land
board) presided over by a departmental
official. On each board there are two
local members appointed by the party
in power. Having had opportunities of
judging, I question whether 70 p.c. of
these worthy gentlemen could pass an
examination embracing an elementary
test of their knowledge of the law which
they are supposed to administer, together
with intermediate-standard mathematics
and the writing of a business letter. This
reappraisement of Crown lands, so far
as it has gone, is the most outrageous
proceeding ever foisted on a long-suffer-
ing people by an inefficient Government
department; and every time the Gov-
ernment looks at the situation it gets
cold feet. —Yours etc., 27/19.
- ———
Titular Dignity.
By direction of the State Arbitration
Court keepers of lodging- and boarding-
houses in Westralia must address their
feminine employees as “Mrs.” or “Miss”
if they desire to be so addressed.
The title complex is a curious one.
Emperors and Czars may carry on a
correspondence in the Willy-Nicky style.
Crack cavalry messes may wipe out class
distinctions and say “Jones, you know
Smith, don’t you?” But the deeper we
plunge into democracy the more the
craving for titular appendages grows.
Your stern democrat is more firmly
“The Honorable T. Snoggins, M.L.C.,”
than any banker or merino squatter.
Plain, blunt democrats like Mr. T. G.
Murray, who parted with Langism only on
a pojnt of principle—the gentleman once
averred that the great J.T. was not demo-
cratic enough for him—never take to
their heels when knighthoods pursue
them, as one is said to be pursuing Mr.
Murray. The letters J.P. have a fascina-
tion for those who can get them, and
V.D., 1.5.0., Deputy-Sub-Commissioner
and their like have a certain charm,
though we have not come to the stage of
writing to the local building inspector
according to the business for which he
works, as say, Hen Oberfeuerversiche-
runggesellschaftbauausseher Schmidt, or
of addressing every gargon as “Mr. Head
Waiter,” as do the stern Hitlerian social-
ists of Germany.
It is quite right that domestics, as well
as others, should be able to command
respect for their persons, but the new
system will have its inconveniences.


Society
“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Darlinghearsed”: The participants in
the street rumpus were slightly known
to me, at least by sight and reputation.
Blank and Dash had always been cobbers
and the former seemed to be supremely
indifferent to the intimacy, a subject of
scandalised whispers, between his wife
and his pal. Neighbors wondered how
long Blank would stand it. Appar-
ently the break had come, for both men’s
faces were bleeding, and three friends
were holding the bellowing Blank with
difficulty. “Don’t be a damn fool, Jack,”
said one. “This sort of thing will only
land you in the police court, and that’ll
drag your wife into it. You wouldn’t
like that.” Blank paused in his struggles,
as if astonished. “Wife?” he cried. “My
wife doesn’t come into it! The blighter
took my girl friend to the pictures last
night.”

“El V,”: Is there any contemporary
instance of ingratitude to match that of
a Canberra civil servant whose case has
got into the papers? First, his country
“Young woman, you’ll have to go easy. The police tell me you’ve knocked
down seven persons this year.”
“Dad, what liars they are! It’s only six. One was the same man twice.”
provided him with a national city replete
with Parliament and swimming baths.
Then it found a job for him there at
£5 Os. Id. a week. Not satisfied with
the recreation furnished by four pubs,
a golf course and a national rose garden,
the fellow got married. Now he com-
plains that there isn’t a vacant house
in the place. But if the Commission
built more houses its accommodation
palaces would be nearly empty, and that
would never do. It has solved the pro-
blem by sticking the employee in a Gov-
ernment boarding-house at one end of
the town, and his wife in another at
the other end, and charging them
only 9d. a week more than his
salary for the convenience of living so
far apart. And the “victim” of this kind-
liness grumbles. If he doesn’t like his lot
he and his wife should go and live under
a tree. There are 2,000,000 magnificent
Government trees about Canberra.

“X.S.”: Melbourne’s police patrol
justified itself again when it got a call
from the night watchman at a radio-
equipment factory in Swanston-street. It
turned up, and waited quietly in a room
from whose ceiling came sounds indi-
cative of painful industry. A hole
appeared in the roof, a man’s body
dropped through, and the John Hops
nabbed it.

“Arges”: “Choices” may be Billy
West, but he is quite wrong about “Tip-
perary” (B. 22/11/’33). Jack Judge
wrote the song, but, except that it was
done for a bet, his own story is a very
different one. Judge says it was written
on January 31, 1912, “It was conceived
hastily and impetuously; the music I
composed in little over an hour.” At the
time he was playing at the Grand Theatre.
Stalybridge, Lancashire, not the Alham-
bra in London, and the other party to
the wager was not Billy West, but
a Mr. Frank Newbury. I was saying what
I could do when Newbury challenged me. “I’ll
bet you five bob you cannot write the words,
compose the music and complete in entirety an
original song in a day.”
As to its connection with Ireland the
author is equally explicit: “I visualised
a scene which is not infrequent in big
cities —that of the Irishman thinking of
homeland.”

“Schnorrer”: The suggestion that the
British High Commissioner in Palestine
“had to play the role of King Solomon”
to the present Empress of Ethiopia (B.
15/11 /’33) would be calculated to em-
barrass that worthy person if he is any-
thing of a historical student. In the Holy
Book of Ethiopia, which was at the Brit-
ish Museum long enough to be translated
before it was returned to its rightful
owners, it is set forth that the Queen
of Sheba disdained to take a husband
from the local princes ; her journey to
Jerusalem was made with the express
determination that the reputed wisest
king in the world should be the father of
her heir. When the youngster grew up
he was sent to see his dad, who greeted
him warmly and wanted him to stay;
when the prince persisted in returning to
his future kingdom the sons of the most
exalted families in Israel were requisi-
tioned to escort him home. Some of
these young men plotted to take the Ark
of the Covenant with them, and, by sub-
stituting a dummy, succeeded. They
were pursued when the substitution was
discovered ; but, acording to the “Kebra
Negast” (the Holy Book), they got clean
away, and naturally none of them ever
dared to return. . Abyssinian noblemen
are to this day distinctly Jewish, and the
laws of Moses are observed.

“Tamornie”: I agree with “Chev.” (B.
15/11/’33) that an artist or sculptor
could not find fault with the presenta-
tion of Phar Lap in the National
Museum, but a veterinary surgeon would
hardly miss the defect pointed out to me
by two farmer friends. The set of Phar
Lap’s ears, if noticed on a live horse,
would immediately suggest that the ani-
mal was not in the best of health. The
organs have an appearance difficult to
put in words, but significant to any man
who has studied horses closely.
“Nakh”: “Why so much discussion

asked “Modern but Decent” in a recent
issue of Melb. “Sun.” “On my first visit
to the National Gallery I was ashamed
to think I had taken two young ladies
to view naked figures of men and
women.” Why, indeed? The writer may
or may not be serious, but he or she has
really exposed a first-rate example of
conventional hypocrisy. I have seen
clerical gentlemen at art shows calmly
“Iƒ you marry him for his money he will always be
throwing it in your face.”
“I shan’t worry so long as he keeps on throwing it. Banknotes won’t hurt a
girl.”
surveying the counterfeit representation
of a female in the nude in paint. The
same gentlemen would cry havoc on a
similarly naked display in a novel or
any other kind of book, such as Norman
Lindsay’s “Redheap”; as for the same sort
of thing in real life, they would regard
it as unthinkable. The license given to
painters to depict the nude is extended
only to one of the sexes, as far as paint-
ing is concerned, though, for some reason
or other, an artist can depict the un-
clothed male provided he sticks to the
etching medium. It is a purely acciden-
tal survival, and, since national galleries
are highly respectable public institutions,
“Modern but -Decent” has logic on his
or her side.

“Vic. Square”: Writing of the approach-
ing marriage of Melbourne’s Lord Mayor,
“Chevroford” says (B. 8/11 /’33) that the
records of the leading cities of the Em-
pire have been ransacked without bring-
ing to light a parallel. The ransacking
couldn’t have been very thor-
ough. Lavington Bonython
was Mayor of Adelaide for
two terms (1912-13) and
Lord Mayor for three (1928-
30). While Mayor in 1912
he married the present Mrs.
Lavington Bonython. She
entered the church as a girl
of 20, and left it as Mayor-
ess of Adelaide, and no more
popular couple has occupied
the dual position.

“Morning Glory”: One
interesting result of the end
of prohibition in the United
States is that many illustrious
American citizens, exiled for
years from their native land,
are being exhorted to return
to the shelter of Old Glory.
These are the professional
cocktail-shakers of the old
regime, many of whom, in
New York and Washington
especially, enjoyed a fame
hardly exceeded by Hollywood stars.
When the shadow of Pussyfoot John-
son fell over the land they went to
Europe, where they are to-day command-
ing princely emoluments in London and
Paris and at Monte Carlo.
“Homfrey Beale”: The use of petrol as
a stimulant (B. 8/11/ ’33) was by no means
unknown in the A.I.F. —especially in
“Australia” camps, where the prevalence
of leave caused headaches and cashless-
ness frequently to synchronise. One
addict reprimanded by our padre offered
in extenuation the plea that moderation
was more common among petrol-swiggers
than among devotees of any other tipple ;
he said a dessertspoon twice a day was
his limit.

“S.T.S.”: The fable about crying Wolf
has had a nasty illustration in Adelaide.
A boy of 17 slid into the water at a
swimming club on the Torrens, cried
“Help!” and disappeared. He was a
strong swimmer and diver, and a con-
firmed practical joker, and nobody wor-
ried—till it was too late. The new coro-
ner, Blackburn (a lawyer, and, incident-
ally, a V.C.), blamed everybody, includ-
ing the deceased, and laid down the rules
that every cry for help ought to be re-
sponded to seriously and at once, and
that any joker found to be u~ing it
wrongfully ought to be expelled from
his club.

“Pawang”: A real crime which re-
calls H. G. Wells’s story “The Stolen
Bacillus” has just been unearthed in
Vienna. The photographer in a hospital
paid his suit to a typist at the same in-
stitute. The damsel turned him down,
and he gassed himself. The girl was
then found to be at death’s door with
typhoid and paratyphoid, and the doc-
tors found that she had undoubtedly been
inoculated with a mixed culture containing
the bacilli. In Sydney about ten years
ago some guinea pigs were stolen from
the Prince Alfred Hospital. If the thief
made a meal off them he probably didn’t
need an emetic when he read in the next
morning’s papers that the animals had
been infected by the doctors with deadly
germs for experimental purposes. The
report, however, was a canard designed
to give the miscreant a fright. In Wells’s
story the man who stole the germs in-
tended to poison London’s water supply,
but swallowed the lot to escape from the
police. The bacilli, however, were not
dangerous to human life.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: American slang rounds the
earth by reason of its graphic pungency.
And yet, after all, the origin is too often
quite meaningless— except to Americans.
“Spilling the beans,” for instance, which
I saw on a Sydney paper’s contents bill
last week. Everybody knows what it
signifies, but, except solo-whist players,
I have never known any Australians who
did spill beans or had any occasion to do
so. We don’t use them enough. But the
phrase has a ring, like “Attaboy,” and it
goes. Unlike most U.S. slang, it has
a classic origin, too—that is, if James
Russell Lowell was a classic. This was
how he put it:
Democracy gives every man
The right to be his own oppressor;
But a loose Gov’ment ain’t the plan,
Helpless as spilled beans on a dresser.
Few who employ the phrase in these
parts think of dressers or Governments,
but, remembering the futility of James
Scullin, they might see the applicability.

“Spasebo”: A courtly exchange of cor-
respondence between Archbishops Head
and Mannix concerning the proposed
Eucharistic procession through Mel-
bourne to culminate on the Parliament
House steps ended with F. W. Mel-
bourne, supported by the Presbyterian
Moderator and the ex-president of the
Methodist Conference, communicating
their views to the press. These included
the familiar argument that the Protestant
who viewed the procession would be put
in a quandary whether to be guilty of
discourtesy by keeping his hat on when
the Host passed or, by taking it off, tacitly
give consent to a doctrine which he
holds to be idolatrous. Archbishop Man-
nix’s rejoinder is that the procession has
already been held in Sydney and many
other places in the world. By a remark-
able coincidence it is just 50 years
since the Mayor of Melbourne re-
ceived a humble deputation from the Sal-
vation Army seeking permission to walk
through the small streets previous to their
hour of worship. Those were the days
when the Salvarmy’s street meetings
were regarded as a threat to pew rents.
The Mayor refused the request, and
quoted precedents in S. Australia, N. S.
Wales and Maoriland.
LYNCH LAW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Senate President Lynch, replying to Senator'
Dunn, said that, as far as he was concerned, women
311 slacks would not be admitted to the precincts
of Parliament.”
There are oldsters who flatly refuse
To alter, revise or relax
Their sturdy Victorian views
On the delicate subject of “slacks.”
Beach costumes that feature the backs
Their wrath will arouse, it’s a cinch;
And a lady sans petticoats smacks
Of something improper to Lynch,
She horrifies Senator Lynch.
In the Reps., I’ll go bail and be bound,
It’s little or nothing they care
What women who’re snooping around
To see or to hear them may wear.
They move, with the rest of us, there;
They don’t from realities flinch
Or legs—an acceptable pair.
But he finds them distressing, does Lynch;
They grate upon President Lynch.
It was Senator Dunn who began
The move to protest and rebel
’Gainst girls in the garb of a man
Intruding where Senators dwell.
“And they’ll take, it’s a monty, an ell,”
Said Pat, “if we give them an inch.”
Philosophy cynic but, well,
It’s the wisdom of Senator Lynch,
The dictum of President. Lynch.
You are bifurcate beings, we’ll admit,
My sisters, however you’re dressed,
But (whisper) where Senators sit
It’s something that shouldn’t be stressed.
Short skirts were a trial, it’s confessed;
Pius fours are no end of a pinch ;
But girls who attention arrest
In “slacks” are a terror to Lynch,
He groans at beholding them, Lynch.

“Menterie”: Sydney papers published
a yarn last week to the effect that the
Foreign Office had announced that
Colonel Fawcett and his party, who van-
ished into the jungles of the upper
Amazon seven years ago, and have not
been heard of since, had been located as
alive and living with the natives. The
official statement of the F.O. rather
knocks this yarn endways. It says it got
the information from an Italian explorer,
who had it from a Dominican friar,
whose informant was an Indian woman.
It all closely resembles the tip for the
Flying imparted by the milkman, on the
authority of the niece of his wife’s uncle,
who had the dinkum oil from a
bloke who has a contract for shifting the
manure from the training stable where
the good thing abides.

“Nakh”: A farmer at Gordon (Vic.)
lost a spanner while ploughing. Return-
ing to look for the implement he found
it lying beside a piece of quartz turned
up by the plough. A pick and shovel
served to expose the reef, and the subse-
quent crushing of ten tons put £448 in
the delighted cocky’s poke. Over £6000
of gold has been obtained in this district
in the last two years, the result being a
rush of prospectors from all parts.

“Mrs. Maggs”: The Chinese belief
that spitting in the streets is harmless, the
sun and air killing the germs (B. 8 /11 / ’33),
“That foreigner you introduced me to has sparrow eyes.”
“Brown, you mean.”
“No; they flit from limb to limb.”
is not shared by English or Australian
health authorities. I have before me a
poster which that t.b. germs are
frequently carried by careless spitting,
the sputum drying and the liberated
germs being carried into the air. Still
there may be something in the Chinese
idea. A doctor of my acquaintance will
not have a drain on his place; all water
and domestic slops are thrown on a large
grass plot. He maintains that, when ex-
posed to sunlight and fresh air, they are
less harmful than when pent up in gutters
and drains, especially underground ones.

“Lao-dah”: A small boy had an extra-
ordinary experience when a cloudburst
hit Melbourne the other Saturday. He
was playing in a stormwater drain in
Hawthorn when a sudden spate swept
him off his feet. His
companions saw him
disappear into the
mouth of a tunnel
and gave him up for
lost. He returned
home, damp but
exultant, an hour or
so later, after a sub-
terranean journey of
a mile and a quarter
which ended in the
swollen Yarra. His
natatorial know-
ledge was confined
to dog-paddling.

“P a t Bushie”:
The Brisbane mail
train pulled up at
Newcastle and I
hurried to the re-
freshment-room. A
moment later a
weary-looking man
elbowed his way to
the bar counter and
meekly called for a
beer “long one,
please.” While wait-
ing for his drink he
unburdened his heart
to me —unloaded, as
it were, some of his
worries to make
room for the beer.
“I’m goin’ t’ Syd-
ney,” he said disgustedly. “I’ll stick it
out now. I never ’ad a ride in a train
afore, an’ I never will agin—after I git
’ome, I mean. ’Struth, ain’t it awful
traveilin’ in them trains!”

“Tarwoona”: “Jerrick” says that “a
high-velocity bullet cracks, and, unless
it has ricocheted, does nothing else in
the way of sound” (B. 25/10/’33).
Rot! They go by with a swish that
seems to leave a cool weal on your
cheek; sometimes they come a long
way from a gun, away on the flank, and
whisper, tiredly, round your knees as you
go forward. And they whisper and
whisper, and then perhaps one strikes
an old screw-iron, gives a bit of a
shriek and goes off into the night whim-
pering. As for rifle fire, the breaking of
sticks is a very good simile. That is if
you are in the open and the firing is on
the flank or a fair distance from you.
Of course, in the rifle-butts or a trench,
a shot fired straight at a mound of earth,
has a much deeper sound; the report is
thrown back on itself.
“LIB”: I had considerable experience
of the old Martini-Henry, Martini-Pea-
body and Westley-Richards projectiles, all
of soft lead and large calibre as com-
pared with those in fashion to-day. These
didn’t “whisper” as they passed but made
a noise not unlike that of a Sydney tram
“Do you know what Mary said to me last night?”
“No.”
“How did you guess it?”
on a small scale, especially if they had
come near the end of a long flight and
were turning end-over-end, as was not
uncommon. Years later, in a brush with
some Bedouin at Bayud in Sinai, some-
thing of the same sort was encountered,
In addition to the long Arab gun firing
a hammered slug, the opposition had
some large-calibre rifles of a type once
used by the Italians, and old 45 Reming-
tons such as once armed the Egyptian

“The Antiquary”: Not by a long chalk
is Carvalhos, in Portugal, the first town
to hold religious processions and recite
litanies (B. 22/11/’33) to combat a plague
of ants. The Middle Ages show dozens
of precedents. When Rome was visited
by a plague of locusts in a.d. 880 recourse
was had to exorcisms. When an army of
slugs devastated estates in the diocese of
Autun in 1487, public processions were
made for three days in every parish, and
the slugs were enjoined to quit the terri-
tory under penalty of being accursed.
* * * *
“Tui”: News that a steam-vent
appeared without warning on the Roto-
rua golf links (B. 22/11/’33) will not un-
duly perturb those who know that ex-
citing locality. Some years ago I watched
a friend who lives there make a large
and beautiful pansy-bed ; early next
morning a fine geyser was playing in
the centre of the plot while the parboiled
pansy plants floated away. I also recall
a Rotorua family who, not liking the
look of a large hump which appeared
on Monday morning in the middle of
„ i F
their concrete wash-house floor, decided
to postpone the job. It was a fortunate
decision, for about midday the whole
wash-house went un in mud, hot water
, , -j-v . .-i . ’ v •
and steam. But the most perturbing ex-
perience was that of a citizen who, tidy-
ing up his garden one afternoon, lost his
spade in a hole. Thinking it was stuck
just below the surface, as it made no
sound in falling, he put his hand in the
hole and felt round. Just then he heard
a 11 + u,,.i tb*.
a dull thud somewhere down in the
depths of the earth, indicating that the
spade had only just reached bottom and
that he was living on the crust of some
. , . TT ,
huge subterranean cavern. He moved.

“Val”: “Argot” complains (B.
15/11/’33) of the growing use of that
jargon which speaks of “complexes.” He
might have referred to the persistent mis-
use of the term “an inferiority complex.”
This is invariably used to describe
humility when it means directly the oppo-
site. The latest edition of the “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica” states that the emo-
tions attaching to the idea of inferiority
“cause the subject to attempt to compen-
sate for his inferiority in various unneces-
sary ways, such as causeless pugnacity,
unprovoked attacks on others, or anti-
social behavior.” Humility is a conscious
conviction and acknowledgment of in-
feriority, but when inferiority is re-
pressed the complex comes in. Without
repression there is no complex.

“S.T.S.”: The neatest Lindsay Gordon

ments that would have been his as Oppo-
sition leader. Which recalls that it has
sometimes proved hard to establish who
is Opposition leader. In South Aus.,
where there are three Labor groups and
an Independent or two, Premier Butler
had to make the decision himself; he
chose Lacey, who had the largest Labor
following. When Scaddan wrenched him-
free from the Westralian Labor party,
after a period of anguished indecision,
over the conscription business, he insisted
on s Oll regarding himself as Opposition
leader and hung on to the screw for some
months by right of possession; Col-
lier, who had stepped into Scaddan’s shoes
as Labor leader, had to content himself
with a protest. The squabble wasn’t
ended until Parliament met and the man
in possession was formally deposed,

“Nakh”: A soldier settler at Rosedale
(Vic.) received the following communi-
cation from the shire secretary:
j am radier surprised at your cool letter, and
it just emphasises my very poor opinion of the
returned soldiers, who, in general, appear to
think they can do as they like and treat obliga-
tions with contempt. The council has gone to
a j ot eX p ense j n making roads for their use
and now is being turned down by a lot who
had better been left in France,

recipient had stuck to his block
f or y 2 years, and had fallen behind in
rates on ]y j as t year. His reply was
a model of restra int:
.
I recently wrote your secretary regretting my
j na^j|jt y to meet m y obligations in regard to
overdue rates and interest amounting to £6 4s.
I explained my position in moderate language,
To “Y dismay, on Armistice Day I received an
official staggering indictment of my sell and the
" orps to w 6 £ ich f had the honor to belong.
May I point out that in our service to the
nation, I and others offered health and life.
Presumably there is some merit in such service ;
otherwise, why record it on honor ro s.
When the shire council met a motion was
tabled calling for the secretary s resig-
nation. It was withdrawn on his explain-
ing that he had been wound up, and
would apologise to the soldier in para-
cular and ex-servicemen in general. He
had two sons at the front.
THE BRIGHT SIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Canon Hammond said that the dole had at least
taught us that we all eat far too much. Dr. Purdy
said that Sydney reached a higher standard of health
last year than ever before?’
The uses of adversity are sweet,
So Shakspeare tells. And one suspects he
knew
Th’ unpleasantness of having less to eat
Now and again than he was minded to,
And less to drink as well (most poets do).
But ev’ry cloud has got a silver lining,
And scantiness of tucker injures few
Compared with those who die from over-dining.
The world has had to tighten up its belt
And on the bill-of-fare economise.
But, brother, don’t forget the pinch you felt
Carried its compensations in disguise.
What though you missed the cakes and ale
and pies
And saveloys, there’s little use repining;
For ev’ry one from commons short that dies
A dozen dig their graves by over-dining.
A daily apple keeps away the med.,
You’ve heard. It’s truer still of Spartan fare.
There’s comfort in the thought, when all is said,
To-day we’re healthier than we ever were.
There’s no specific like a diet spare
If physic to the dogs you’d be consigning.
Short rations constitutions few impair,
But Lord! how many die from over-dining.

POLITICAL POINTS
Beasley, made a moving
appeal the other day for a national plan
to rehabilitate the coalmining industry,
in which 7000 men are out of work, with
no prospect of getting any, and “the rest
are eking out a precarious existence.”
It was expected that the N.S.W. Assembly
representatives of the coalminers would
take up the cry, but they were strangely
silent. Mr. Badly’s Great Thought for
the week was that “all the public ser-
vants’ salary cuts should be restored.”
If Lang goes to Canberra, Badly may
become Premier. His crowd is sure of
the coalies who have no wages, but there
is some doubt about the public ser-
vants whose salary cuts should all be
restored.
The Vic. Ministry continues not to
make up its mind about the rail v. motor
business. ’Bus owners start services
and create new suburban areas and then
the services are stopped, with the result
that people who build houses along the
routes find themselves abandoned in the
wilderness. This has happened several
times at Heidelberg. Some politicians
won’t know that the motor vehicle has
been invented until they get run over by
one.
Another of those “unity” conferences at
Sydney has arrived at what Lang’s news-
paper describes as “a basis for enduring
and equitable consolidation of the Com-
monwealth-wide Labor movement.”
Scullin and his friends have yet to be
heard from. Even agreement between
N. S. Wales and Victoria and the outing
of Scullin will not necessarily mean that
other States will fall in behind Lang.
Queensland and Westralian A.L.Ps. have
what one of Lang’s lieutenants calls “an
unaccountable antipathy” to the great
man.
“S. M. Herald” has discovered the
latest Lang plan, particulars of which
were here published on November 8. It
is a pale shadow of Theodorian national-
ism, in which the planner says he doesn’t
want to take anything from anybody
except the banks. People at the Sydney
Trades Hall, where language is more
pungent than kind, are saying that the
Inner Group has abandoned its slogan
“Humanity Before Money” for a new
one: “Power Before Principle.”
A long-distance shindy is going on
between Dr. Mannix and General
O’Duffy. The archbishop started it by
saying that the general was “doing the
Empire’s bidding” and that “his time”
was “coming.” O’Duffy retorted that the
prelate’s “national record in his home-
land scarcely entitles his pronouncements
to serious consideration” ; that he was a
fervent royalist when president of May-
nooth —“had the Union Jack aloft and
invited every leading Tory in the country
to meet the present King.” In fact,
It was only when Dr. Mannix reached Aus-
tralia that he jumped from one extreme to the
other.
Two rounds gone, and O’Duffy leading
on points.
The chairman of the Metropolitan
Milk Board is pained at the thought that
Sydney drinks only half a pint of milk
per head per day when milk is “so
indispensable to children, the sick and
the aged,” and “so important in adult
diet.” The gentleman invites suggestions
as to how consumption may be in-
creased. One plan suggests itself. Do
away with the artificial restriction of sup-
plies, and let people get milk at a fair
price instead of the outrageous 7d. a
quart, and more.
An appalling lot of claptrap was
hurled at the public during Sydney’s
Health Week and Milk Week, but Mar-
tin, the Minister for Justice, said one
pertinent thing:
The farmers who supply you with milk get
more than twice as much for their milk as
we do for our butter.
Martin comes from the North Coast,
which, for some reason connected with
politics, is prohibited from sending milk
to Sydney.
Queensland Labor is giving the Stanley
by-election a miss. Only two men
nominated: R. K. Bell, an Esk grazier,
who will run as a Country-Prog., and A.
H. Langdon, a Brisbane broker with pro-
perty in the electorate—he is styled an
Independent. At the general election
Stanton, the Labor man, made a fair
showing and the verdict of a farming
electorate on his party’s record would be
instructive, but the bosses prefer to do
without it.
A doubles tote is to be installed at
one of the Sydney racecourses. The club
had some trouble in getting permission
“HELP! HELP !”
“The wheat situation has proved almost too much for the Prime Minister.”
from the Government, which is strangely
apathetic about the revenue possibilities
of the machine. Instead of giving a
grudging consent, it should insist on all
clubs with betting licenses introducing
straight-out, place and doubles totes, with
ss. as the minimum stake in the paddock
and 2s. 6d. in the cheaper parts.
South Australia is going back to Mc-
Bagg. Hitherto banned from all race-
courses (though they betted under the
lap) bookmakers are to be permitted, not
only to call the odds alongside the tote,
but to lay them in registered shops. Two
per cent, on turnover is to go to the
State. It is a reactionary move, but the
“Liberals” hope it will be profitable.
Cincinnatus Page returned from his
farm full of ideas. One is that the threat-
ened loss of a Federal seat to South Aus.
might be averted without a constitutional
amendment by altering the method of
arriving at the quota.
Divide the number of electors by one more
than the number of seats to be filled. Then
South Aus. would retain its seven seats and
N. S. Wales would gain one.
The other States will probably object.
Still, as the doctor says, it will be
unfair if South Aus. with 341,300 electors
is reduced to six seats when Westralia
and Tasmania with 350,000 electors will
have 10.
The N. S. Wales Government has de-
cided to investigate hospital collection
methods which have been criticised in
The Bulletin. Some balance sheets
scarcely need investigation ; they speak
for themselves. A better move would
be to sweep the whole feverish jumble
of “charity schemes,” sobstuff and
gambles out of existence with one terse
and comprehensive piece of legislation.
It is a good thing we have a Prime
Minister to arbitrate important national
issues, like the dispute over an iron pot
which Pearce’s minions lent to a Sydney
suburb for patriotic purposes. The pot,
being placed on the fire, unexpectedly
became blackened, so Repat. sent in a
bill for £1 11s. In a correspondence on
which the signatures looked like a
national autograph collection, the local
council said it’d be boiled if it paid up,
because the darn utensil wasn’t worth Is.
1 Id. Lyons was appealed to. He an-
nounced (speaking for his distinguished
colleague Defence) that time had been
called, and the thirty-one bob written off.
Brisbane business men are worried by
Forgan Smith’snew Industries Act Amend-
ing Bill, Which gives the Bureau of Indus-
try, hitherto merely a sort of professorial
board of advice, authority to build works
and bridges, and to manage whatever it
constructs. The bureau will have bor-
rowing and debenture-issue powers. It
sounds as if Government butcheries,
stations, fishmarkets and mines had not
cured northern Labor of its passion for
State socialism.
How the official mind works is shown
in the case of Digger Bill Ruthven, now
councillor of his native town of Colling-
wood. Beside the V.C., which he got
at Ville-sur-Ancre in 1918, he came home
with a2O p.c. disability pension. Three
times he has been in hospital since, and
each time has been given £2 2s. a week
compensation for loss of work. Last
time he discovered that this had been
evened up by taking £1 19s. out of the
£lO a year which goes with the V.C. —
it is paid by the British Government
through Repat. His appeal against the
iniquity was dismissed. It is easier to
capture 32 Germans with one revolver
under heavy machine-gun fire, as Ruth-
ven did, than to break down the
stupidity of some of Pearce’s satellites.
It was fondly supposed at U.A.P. head-
quarters that the election of members by
members would give N. S. Wales a last-
ing brake on Labor-socialism. The chill-
ing truth is that 16 of the 30 Leg. Coun-
cillors chosen are or have been Labor-
socialists: Murray, Farrar, Horne and
Courtenay (Have-beens); Higgins, Ryan
and O’Regan (Federal Labor); King,
Concannon, J. B. Martin, Mahony,
Tyrrell, Paddy McGirr and Magrath
(Lang Labor); Alam and Trautwein
(Lang Labor, but not on the ticket).
If a Lang or Badly Government is in
office when the 15 three-year members
have to retire it may conceivably have
a majority in the “reformed” House,
especially as the Ryans and O’Regans are
expected to come in.
The Prime Minister says his Govern-
ment “hopes to be able to afford still
further concessions in taxation,” since
“the only way to absorb men in indus-
try is to stimulate private industry by
taxation relief.”
For every pound remitted in direct and in-
direct taxation much more than a pound is
devoted by industry to the reabsorption of
workers.... The Government does not intend
to borrow huge sums for relief works because
it realises that such a policy provides only a
temporary palliative.
Seeing that this year’s relief work and
sustenance programme is to cost Com-
monwealth and States £31,000,000, it
would be interesting to know what Mr.
Lyons considers “huge sums.” His own
statement squares with what The Bulle-
tin has preached—if he and his State
confreres had cut 50 p.c. off taxes it
would have had more effect on unem-
ployment than the putting of thirty mil-
lion into cement gutterings and sewers.
Hanlon, the Queensland Home Secre-
tary, is introducing a bill making it an
offence to trade in lottery tickets except
under conditions prescribed. It would
be better to make trading in lottery
tickets unlawful in any circumstances;
but that would be too much to expect of
a Government whose Golden Brisket
management has been offering prizes to
persons who make illegal ticket sales in
N. S. Wales.
These Langsters roar a lot, but some
of them do brighten the debates occa-
sionally. For example:
Shannon, M.L.A.: Parents should have charge
of their children, particularly their sons and
daughters.
Ward, As Standing Orders prevent
members from stating the truth, I will depart
from that subject.
Bureaucracy stopped a stinger in
London when Macnaughten, J., in the
King’s Bench, scouted the claim of a
police witness that a statement taken
from an accused person was privileged,
the John Hop having been instructed to
that effect by the Home Secretary’s office.
The Judge adjourned the hearing, and on
resuming produced a letter from the H.S.
claiming that it was contrary to the public
interest to divulge the statement. The
letter was marked “confidential,” but
Macnaughten read it in open court. Fin-
ishing some blistering comment on
modern bureaucratic tendencies, the emi-
nent Wig reminded all and sundry that
British Judges take no orders from any
official, no matter how highly placed, or
from Parliament or the Crown itself.

R.D.Tate’s “The Doughman,” published
this week, is the Australian novel of the
year, and marks an epoch in Australian
writing—it is the first book of fiction
printed here to deal adequately with the
ROBERT D. TATE, author of
“The Doughman.”
atmosphere of an Australian industry.
The author is a descendant of London
builders—Flexon, the inventor of the
painters’ platform, was his great-grand-
father —and of Dublin lawyers. He was
born in Melbourne, educated in M.L.,
and has worked in Billingsgate, in Scot-
tish coalmines, as a freelance journalist
in London, and as a commercial traveller
and a baker in Australia. He knows the
working man as few writers know him.
The Rev. H. E. Warren may be ill
advised in leaving his comfortable vicar-
age at Cullenswood (Tas.) to negotiate
with King Buck-Eye, of Caledon, but no-
body who knows his work at the Roper
River mission will doubt his sincerity or
his courage. Roper conditions were pri-
mitive in Warren’s day, and the country
Rev. H. E. WARREN, who has gone
to bargain with King Buck-Eye, of
Caledon Bay.
he worked through down on to the Lim-
men and up past Nutwood and Hodson
was rough and hard to travel. Some-
times only a red smear along the top of
the long grass showed where the track
ran over which he passed, and any
strange wheel-mark after he took to the
Ford round about Tanumbirini was
almost certain to be the monumental
mark left by Warren hurrying home from
some errand of mercy in the rain. He
knows natives, but whether he knows the
Caledon brand is another matter. All
the N.T. will wish him success.
In S.A. it has been a regular practice
to appoint new K.Cs. every three years.
Appointments are now due, and there
is much guessing as to who the favored
will be. There appears to be only one
certainty tipped—H. G. Alderman, who
was specially thanked in Parliament re-
cently for his help in preparing the Legal
Practitioners Bill. A. J. Hannan, Crown
Solicitor, and Eric Millhouse, a former
Crown Prosecutor, also are mentioned as
likely choices.
A. M. Hertzberg, who becomes the first
life-member of the Brisbane Chamber of
Commerce elected since the foundation
of the Chamber over 70 years ago, is
a polished and upright member of the
local Jewish community. No charity
has ever lacked a few pounds if Hertz-
berg thought it deserving, and no public
service has lacked an unobtrusive worker
while he was about. He stands, rela-
tively, in the North where George Judah
Cohen stands in Sydney.
The resignation of George Black front
the Leg. Council removes from N.S.W.
State politics the last of the first batch
of Labor members who were elected to
the Assembly in 1891. George, who had
an interview with a surgeon on Satur-
day—he came through pretty well —
was once sub-editor of The Bulletin,
then editor of the “Worker.” In
1915 he was Minister for Agriculture, and
for a space afterwards Chief Sec. and
Health Minister. Holman elevated him
to the Council in T 7. He has written
several books, including a history of the
Labor movement.
J. E. Hinton, dead at 84, was
one of the best-known figures in the
Brisbane of the last generation. He was
in charge of the fire brigade from its
foundation in 1882 till his retirement in
1925. Before that he was in the State
permanent defence forces as adjutant of
the Field Artillery Brigade. One of his
sons was killed on Gallipoli.
David Macdonald Ross passed away
suddenly at Gisborne (M.L.). Recently
he retired from the position of Senior
Stock Inspector in the Government Agri-
culture Department, which he had
served for 40 years. A contributor to
The Bulletin under the pen-name
“Darius,” he had five books of verse
to his credit: “The Afterglow,” “Hearts
of the Pure,” “Morning Red,” “The
Promise of a Star” and “Stars in the
Mist.” He was a sound judge and
breeder of horses.
“Cadi”: Passed out ’way up north last
week at a ripe old age, Joe Wallace, known
the length of the Darling as “Flash Job.”
He was a picturesque figure—there was
no sting in the nickname, of which he
was proud —and as a horse-breaker he
knew no equal. Joe would have had a
hearty contempt for the breaking-in
methods of to-day. His style was “take
the bag off his blessed eyes and down
with the rails.” Nearly 30 years ago
rumor had it that Joe Wallace had
broken every bone in his body, but that
did not seem either to have affected his
health or daunted his spirit. Recently
he was speared by a native—and sur-
vived it. Old-age got him in the end.
Dr. Thomas Lane Bancroft, whose
passing in Queensland at 73 is chronicled,
died as he lived, avoiding to the last the
limelight he abhorred. The son of a
father whose name is revered for his
work on mosquito-borne diseases, he fol-
lowed up his parent’s investigations into
filaria and malaria for a time until his
interest centred in the life-story of that
living fossil fish the Queensland Cerato-
dus. Medicine to him was just a means
of providing food and fuel for research.
He was the first man to breed the Cerato-
dus in captivity, and some live speci-
mens sent along by him flourish in Bris-
bane Museum after 12 years. The press
of his native land, save in one or two
isolated instances, took no notice of the
passing of the famous scientist, though
science journals all over the civilised
world will make up for that.
Dr. Shields, the U.A.P. man who suc-
ceeds T. C. Manifold as Hon. Minister
in the Argyle Cabinet, is a medico, like
Dr. CLIVE SHIELDS, Hon. Minister in
the Argyle Cabinet (Vic.).
his political boss. Hamilton (Vic.) heard
his first yell and a State school scholar-
ship started him on a brilliant career
at Melb. University. He retired from
medicine in 1928, after practising in
W.A., at Malmsbury (Vic.) and in leading
Melbourne hospitals. He represents
Castlemaine-Kyneton in the Leg. Ass.
J. B. Cramsie’s likeness on this page
is good, but he would never let any cow
of the calibre which the artist has drawn
look at him. He managed a Queensland
station at 21, was in control of a big
meat and boiling-down works at 30,
then formed Comerford, Cramsie and
Co. at Moree, travelled the world and
in time became chairman and general
J. B. CRAMSIE, one of Australia’s
greatest meat experts.
manager of the N.S.W. Metropolitan
Meat Industry Board. He has had a
hand in planning most of the big public
abattoirs in the Commonwealth, has been
chairman of the Australian Meat Council
and represented Australia before the
British Royal Commission on Food-
stuffs and the Economic Commission in
1925. He is a world authority on meat
treatment and to his own detriment has
more than once refused offers to go per-
manently abroad and take charge of big
enterprises in America and elsewhere.
F. McMullen, headmaster of Sydney
Technical High School for the past seven
years, and president of the N.S.W.
Secondary Teachers’ Assoc., will succeed
G. C. Saxby, who retires this year after
nine years as headmaster of Sydney High
School. McMullen started as a pupil-
teacher at Narrabri, and, after various
minor appointments, was in charge of
country high schools until his transfer to
the Tech, in 1926. Always a good sports-
man, he was a prominent Sydney first-
grade cricketer in his day. Latterly, how-
ever, like a true Scot, he has devoted
himself to golf, and is skipper of the
Bonnie Boon club.
Knight James Owen, deputy-chairman
of Reuters, and his lady, who were
Mayor and Mayoress of Exeter, England,
during the war, have not been forgotten
by the Diggers. During their present visit
to Australia in the Ulysses, they have
been received and welcomed at every
port. For four years the lady and her
band of helpers met troop trains at
Exeter station, day and night, to give
weary soldiers tea and sandwiches. In
recognition of this work the Dominion
Governments presented her with flags at
a ceremony in Exeter in 1919 ; the flags
hang in the ancient Guildhall of the
cathedral city. James Owen is the pro-
prietor of many newspapers in Devon,
but despite a very busy business life he
managed to serve his city in civic affairs,
and made himself responsible for the
establishment of a University College,
with numerous hostels, which he hopes
will some day be a full degree college.
Hs is Sheriff of Exeter, chairman of
Exeter Chamber of Commerce, and pre-
sident of the Newspaper Society.

per ton as against £3B 3s. Id., £42 2s. 2d.,
£7O 15s. 9d. and £B3 Is. 4d. for the four

treatment costs (£471,953, including lease,
rents and insurance) were £45 ss. per ton
of copper produced as against £42 17s.
in the previous term and £4B 6s. in ’29.
So it was the exchange premium and
the gold and silver residues which pro-
vided whatever profit there may have
been from mine products, notwithstand-
ing the treatment of more lower-grade
crudes at less cost per ton. The 2} p.c.
div. was “paid out of profits from opera-
tions other than mining.” The co. got a
slightly better return from its invest-
ments :

The year’s gross earnings from all
sources (£585,599) were £2882 better;
exes. (£488,985) were £5839 lighter.
Allowing for minor reserve adjustments,
net earnings sprang £11,176, reaching
£96,687, of which £23,495 was struck off
to cover depreciation and £23,905 was
spent on prospecting and development,
leaving £10,537 more than the div. called
for.

Thus the future of the mine depends
upon the profitable treatment of the low-
grade silicious deposits in the Royal
Tharsis, now being opened up. This has
been made possible by the North Lyell
tunnel, erection of a refinery at Queens-
town, and other successful assaults upon
costs by a keen and efficient management.
Last year 54,257 tons more crudes was
treated, the average grade being 2.79 p.c.

Of the £5,620,589 of paid capital
£2,150,097 is bonus scrip, of which
£1,262,597 was scattered during the three
years to the close of accounts in 1929.
Over the same three years N. S. Wales
developed its biggest thirst, the div. was
lifted from 10 p.c. to 12| p.c., and
1,250,000 paids were put out in connec-
tion with the purchase of Resch’s busi-
ness. Over the three years to June, 1932,
the State’s consumption of beer fell away
by nearly 40 p.c., there had been a heavy
shrinkage in the value of hotel proper-
ties, leases and rentals, and stinging in-
creases in taxation, including excise,
which was bumped up from Is. 3d. to
2s. a gallon in 1929. Still, the div.
dropped no lower than 8 p.c., which sug-
gests that gift-distributions (they make 8
p.c. worth a lot more to old holders)
have not been overdone.
During the last term unemployment
figures (they reached their peak in the
middle of 1932) eased, but there had been
a deep cut in the basic wage, and, after
providing for contingencies, the contrac-
tion in gross earnings was £13,364, mak-
ing the slip £514,817 over the last three
years: —

Exes, were £28,094 lighter, leaving the
declared net result at 8.5 p.c. on capital
as against 8.3, 8.5, 12.2, 14.7, 15.2, 13.1
and 14.1 p.c. back to 1926. An extra
half of one per cent, was distributed,
making 8-y p.c. for the year, the final
being at the rate of 9 p.c. p.a.
On capital as it now stands 9 p.c. would
call for £23,649 more profit than was
declared last year. Still, employment is
increasing, spending is less restricted than
it was, real estate values are steadier,
there has been a 50 p.c. cut in the special
tax on income from property, land and
other taxes have been reduced, and 6d. a
gallon has been knocked off the duty on
beer. Also, the co. enjoys a lion’s share
of the trade in R S. Wales, and is very
well ribbed financially.
The market, therefore, believes that
9 p.c. should not be beyond the co.’s
reach, notwithstanding that the 6d. remis-
sion of duty, or all but a fraction of it,
is being passed on to the public. So the
price of the actively-traded pound shares,
which fell from 51s. in 1929 to 17s. lOd.
in 1931, advanced from 365. 3d. to 435.
3d. over the last 12 months. The return
at 435. 3d. is 4.2 p.c. on a 9 p.c. distribu-
tion. The cover is visibly 235. 3d. in net
tangibles.

sheet figures show it:

This highly-successful fire and marine
office is Auckland-controlled, and has
world-wide connections. Since 1912 it
has transferred no less than £907,910
from reserves to capital account, raising
the latter to £1,031,640; and yet the
growth of reserves has outstripped the
growth of capital, visible accumulations
having mounted to £1,703,409 at August
31. Further, the capital and reserves
have been invested in sound securities,
returns from which have followed close
on the heels of advancing dividend
charges, leaving the underwriting sur-
pluses available to swell investments and
returns therefrom. Last year these re-
turns were £9983 lighter at £122,925, equal
to 11.9 p.c. on capital. Thus has the invest-
ment side of the business become a sheet
anchor to the possibilities of the scrip,
which, of course, are governed by the
co.’s main business of underwriting.
Here are underwriting performances
since the nineties of last century:

The contraction in last year’s net pre-
miums was £13,096, making the slip
£260,304 over the last four years. Still,
the year’s underwriting surplus was
£64,462 as against £60,255, a loss of £6ll,
and surpluses of £70,221 and £92,287
back to 1929. The most heartening
feature of the table is the drop of 12.3
p.c. in the loss rate over the last two
years. Amongst other things, it suggests
a more careful selection of risks gener-
ally, including those in the very tricky
marine market. Now that merchants are
beginning to lengthen their payrolls and
stock sheets, and values are steadier,
premium income might be expected to
benefit.
Allowing for reserve adjustments, the
year’s net return from all sources was
£3139 lighter at £191,304, or 18.5 p.c.
on capital. . So, the 13.3 p.c. div. was
repeated, another £40,000 was struck off
the book value of premises, and £13,752
was visibly ploughed in.
Funds are held in this way:

Book debts .. . . 80,182 2.5 78,111 2.4
During the year municipal debentures
were reduced by £64,627, and stocks,
shares and other debentures by £18,927,
thus enabling £58,663 to be added to
Government securities and £79,711 to
deposits, cash, etc. Policy-holders could
see net tangibles equal to 345 p.c. of
the year’s net premiums, or more than
twice the amount usually considered ade-
quate.
The market prices the pound shares
at 765. as against 555. a year ago. The
rise is due mainly to the cheapening of
money. At 765. the return is 3.5 p.c.
on a 13 1-3 p.c. div. basis.

Pref. divs. reduced by 22} p.c. under Interest
Reduction Act from Oct. 1, 1931.
Including £75,000 for goodwill, this co.
paid £220,000 for the Australian section
of the newspaper business then being car-
ried on by John Norton’s trustees in
1925. Plant in all States was modernised,
freeholds were bought in the three eastern
capitals, and new premises were erected
in Sydney. To help finance the outlay,
£155,000 of fresh capital was gathered,
raising the total to £400,000 in 100,000
9 p.c. first prefs., a like number of 8 p.c.
seconds and 200,000 ords.
For the first three years the ords. got
12j p.c. Then came slump ; also re-
moval exes., special allowance for depre-
ciation and the loss on the sale of the
co.’s former Brisbane premises affected
earnings—£10,547 of the losses was
capitalised. So, although circulation held
fairly well, and savings followed an over-
haul of the organisation (publication of
the Perth edition was suspended in 1931),
the ord. div. dropped to 10 p.c. in ’29
and then to 5 p.c.
For the last term £2945 more profit
was claimed. After allowing for the pref.
divs. (owing to the statutory cut, the
firsts now get 6.9 p.c. and the seconds
6.2 p.c.), enough remained to show 8 p.c.
on ord. capital as against 6.4, 5.2, 4.6,
8.1, 15 and 19.4 p.c. back to 1927, and
6} p.c. was distributed. The prefs., in
which the public is interested, are entitled
to advance with the ords., after the
latter have received an equal div., up to
their original contract rates. These rates
plus 9 p.c. to the ords. would call for
£5llO more than was netted last year.
The financial position improved:

was added to cash, etc. The spring in the
more or less liquid surplus (£44,219, in-
cluding stocks and investments) was
£13,185.
The market prices the firsts at 265. and
the seconds at 225. 6d. as against 235.
and 19s. 3d. respectively a year ago. At
the higher figures the return is 5.3 p.c.

last year’s distributions. The net tan-
gible backing is £3 6s. firsts and £2 6s.

This co. (it turns out powdered milks,
etc.) began in 1909. In 1922 and 1923
it was able to lift paid capital from
£30,000 to £120,000 by bonus issues. The
figure has since advanced to £150,000 by
cash subscriptions, and over the seven
years to the close of accounts in 1930
divs. averaged a shade over 12 p.c. But
slump brought with it severe competi-
tion and price recessions, while ex-
change and the rise in the price of tin
have kept the bill for tinplate, used in
the manufacture of the co.’s containers,
high. Still, shareholders have not failed
to receive a div., and the figures have
turned in the right direction again.
The improvement during the last term
was due almost entirely to savings in exes.
(£10,979, down £1275). The £8344 netted
was 5.5 p.c. on capital as against 4.6,
5.1, 11.2, 13.7, 17.8, 12 and 5.2 p.c. back
to 1926, when failure of a subsidiary
formed to manufacture milk jelly affected
the figures. So half a point was added to
the div., making it 4i p.c.
Over the last 12 months the market
has lengthened its bid for the pound
shares from 15s. 6d. to 20s. 3d., partly
on the prospect of the co. developing a
satisfactory overseas trade—one of the
directors recently visited China, Japan,
India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies
for this purpose. Also, the board has
decided to buy the Australian rights to
the Kestner process for spray-drying
fruit, vegetables and other food products.
Obviously much depends upon the man-
agement’s success or otherwise in these
connections.
The co. has enough ready money to
finance considerable expansion of its
activities:

£337 when 21
His father's foresight
TWENTY-ONE! It is a great day in a lad’s life when
he reaches 21, and a very wonderful day if his
father can present him with one or more A.M.P.
N policies.
Take a certain lad who recently celebrated the great
day. When he was born his father took out an A.M.P.
policy that would give him £250 when he was 21. By
the 21st birthday the amount had grown with bonuses to
£337; a very pice coming-of-age gift, indeed.
But there was more! Under the A.M.P. Table ZN, the
father, by investing £4/-/10 half-yearly (even so small
a sum), had secured for his boy when he was born, a
£l,OOO whole-life policy. If the father had died before
the boy had reached 21, no further premiums would have
been payable until the boy reached 21. The father did
not die, and now the young man, because of his father’s
foresight, gets a £l,OOO policy that ordinarily would cost
him twice as much. With bonuses such policy may well
be worth £2,000 if he survive to a good age.
What more could a father, with but a small income, do
for his boy?
Any representative of the A.M.P. Society will be glad to
tell any parent how he may arrange these benefits.

Mt, Morgan has decided to offer share-

30s. each, approximately one for six. The
old shares are at 58s. on the market,
which makes the rights worth about 245.
The issue, when fully subscribed and
paid, will provide £13,956 of share pre-
miums, and lift capital to £200,000 in
£1 shares. These will be later subdivided
into ss. shares, and a register opened in
London. Enlargement of the plant capa-
city to at least 5000 tons of ore weekly,
and improvement in treatment methods,
are the first items in the co.’s programme
for the coming year.

A rush has set in to the new East Port-
land goldfield, about 60 miles south-east
of the Batavia River, Cape York Penin-
sula. To date over three miles of leases
have been pegged, chiefly by men from
Batavia. There is a network of reefs and
leaders in the locality, all of which are
claimed to carry fine gold ; no specimen
gold has been found. If early crushings
at the Towers come up to expectations, a
battery is to be erected forthwith. An
old Batavia miner, one of the first on the
new field, says it is one of the best
battery propositions that the North has
seen for many years.

Herbert Gepp’s report on the Clon-
curry district (Q.) indicates that there is
not sufficient easily-won high-grade ores
available to warrant the erection of cen-
tral smelters there. The rich stone appar-
ently does not live at depth, notwith-
standing that large tonnages were indi-
cated by the exploration and partial
development work of the old companies
prior to 1920; many thousands of
pounds was spent in the search. Gepp,
however, is confident that with improve-
ment of copper prices, and with organ-
isation and systematic development,
large-scale operations will come again.

Efforts to revive the old Woolgan
goldfield (N.Q.) have hung fire. Still, the
Government has given an impetus by
providing a three-head pilot plant to
afford prospectors a chance of testing
the values of their reefs. The first 54 tons
yielded 320 z. bullion, and recoveries are
reported to be satisfactory. It is only
fair-grade for small reefs, and as sul-
phides come in at water level gravity
tables will likely be required for con-
centration if the field goes ahead. The
Aurora seems the most promising show
at present; it is averaging over an ounce
on a 2ft. reef.
* * * *
There is considerable activity on the
Warwick (Q.) goldfields, but few shows
have proved payable so far. The best
seems to be the Depression, at Thane’s
Creek, where the owners have taken out
£7OO in the last 12 months. The shoot
has opened out to a thickness of over
18in., averaging loz. per ton, and bigger
tonnage and better recovery are expected
for the next 12 months.

The Irvinebank Tin Works (N.Q.) will
run till Christmas on ore in the hoppers.
There was very little production last year,
but the rise in the price of the metal has
resulted in the production of £5OOO worth
of concentrates during the last four
months, and the miners are averaging £6
per ton on 4 p.c. ore. The big deposits
on Wyatt’s lease are yielding fair ton-
nages of similar grade.

At Mount Lofty, on the Anakie field,
Clermont (C.Q.), a new reef has been
struck. At 22ft. it is 3ft. wide, and car-
ries high values. At Mount Oswald a
number of claims are being opened up.
Work continues at Fahey’s show, Mount
Clifford, which caused some excitement
last year, but nothing of much conse-
quence has yet been unearthed. Nearer
Clermont, Bedford’s reef has been
optioned by a Melbourne co., and a
pump has been installed to dewater the
main shaft. The co.’s engineer is also
inspecting other properties in the district.

Many old shows on the Cania goldfield,
Gladstone (Q.), are being opened up again.
A trial crushing of \\ tons from the
Victoria, a profitable producer in the
early days, returned 2\oz. The lease
contains a large body of ore assaying
lldwt., which will probably be treated.
On the Shamrock, another good pro-
ducer of 40 years ago, a syndicate has
struck two intersecting reefs. Ift. and
3ft. 6in. wide, at 58ft., assaying 2oz. and
loz. respectively. Extensive develop-
ment work has been carried out, and
production is to commence forthwith.

After two years spent in bringing water
close on 30 miles from St. Columba Falls,
Siamese Tin Syndicate, the big English
concern with large interests in Malaya,
has started sluicing its alluvial tin-bearing
ground at St. Helens, East Coast, Tas.
The race is designed to carry 100 sluice
heads, but work has commenced with 20 ;
more faces will be brought in later. The
syndicate is investigating other areas
along the coast.
Pioneer Tin, Bradshaw’s Greek (Tas.),
has been taken over by the Endurance
Co. for £15,000. Depletion of payable
ore in the co.’s main workings was the
chief reason for selling. Endurance pro-
poses to extend the power line to its
own show, further up the coast. Tribu-
tors will continue to work the Pioneer,
which has produced 10,000 tons of stream
tin and paid over £500,000 in divs. since
the beginning of this century.

The 50,000 Triton shares reserved
for Westralian applicants caused a
scramble. Perth brokers made good
time to the Triton office with bundles of
application forms, but all drew a blank ;
outsiders had the luck. Many sold
promptly at premiums from Is. Bd. to
2s. per share, but those who well know
the Triton mine, late Mararoa, Cue
(W.A.), are holding for better things.

Wiluna (W.A.) treated 42,015 tons for
11,075 fine ounces and a working sur-
plus of £48,989 during October. A bore-
hole on the Bulletin lease, \\ miles from
the main shaft, disclosed an ore-body
over two chains wide, values varying
from 3s. to 50s. 3d. per ton. It looks
like a handsome addition to the already
large ore reserves.

got £107,386 from 43,892 tons ; in July,
£103,085 from 45,339 tons; August,
£104,642 from 45,100 tons. The co. has
been doing well, and, should the in-
creased grade of ore be maintained, an
annual distribution of 4s. a share appears
to be within easy reach.
* * * *
While N. Kalgurli continues to in-
crease its big ore reserves, little is being
done to provide for their treatment on
a large scale. Certainly the new joint
Boulder Perseverance and N. Kalgurli
plant has been landed at Fremantle, and
should be in operation by February next.
This will enable the North to deal with
5000 tons monthly, plus ore sent to other
mills. Still, judged by Lake View and
Wiluna standards, such an output is no
more than a hatful.
* * * *
H. Annear, one of the original dis-
coverers of that good div.-payer Edna
May, has reported on the Yilgarn, a
resurrection of the old Banker, Southern
Cross. He says “ore above the 180 ft.
level has been stoped upwards, and
if the 180 ft. level values continue to
200 ft., the mine will become a good pro-
ducer.” That means calls to provide cash
for development and, possibly, equip-
ment.
* * * *
A Sydney co. is reported to have taken
an option over Miller’s lease at Brown-
hill, near Kalgoorlie. The mine was
worked last year by Brown’s Reward Co.
(now developing the Lady Gladys, Mul-
line), but without definite results. The
lease embraces the site of the old Brown-
hill Hotel, and the first gold was found in
what was formerly the cellar.
* * * *
A large milky-colored quartz reef, over
20ft. wide, has been struck at Yarri
(W.A.). Values vary from Bdwt. to loz.,
and two leases have been taken up. One,
owned by Manegay and party, is under
option to the Goldfields Australian
Development for 12 months ; the price
is £15,000.
* * * *
New Lancefield, Laverton (W.A.), is
unwatering the mine and repairing the
main shaft. Oil flotation will probably
be the treatment process. Costs are
expected not to exceed 255. per ton.
* * * *
Mt. Jackson, Southern Cross, paid
£6OOO in settlement of purchase con-
sideration out of gold won during the
currency of the option. The co. has
since treated 120 tons for 318 oz. This,
together with a 6d. call, has provided
enough to buy a small treatment plant.
* * * *
Great Victoria and Hopes Hill
(Southern Cross), Tindals (Coolgardie)
and Big Bell (Cue) are a few of West-
ralia’s large gold-bearing ore deposits.
They are all to be tested, and if any can
show enough sdwt. stuff it will be
equipped quickly enough.
* * * *
For the six months to the end of
August, King Solomon Deep Lead,
Southland (M.L.), got 1850 fine ounces of
gold, which yielded a net profit of
£2343. A second div. of 25 p.c. was
paid on a capital of £13,000. The shil-
ling shares fetch 3s. 3d. on the market.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
G.H.H.: (1) and (3) Cannot say; the co.
does not publish its accounts. (2) By a search
at the Registrar-General’s Office, Sydney. (4)
Shares are not listed on ’Change. (5) Mer-
chants and Traders’ Association, 17 Martin-
place, Sydney, may be able to assist W. 8.:
At 28/9/’32 creditors had been paid 12s. 6d.
in the pound. At the same date the book
value of the surplus was 16s. Bd. per pound
of pref. capital, subject to realisation exes., etc.
But many of the securities require careful nurs-
ing if best results are to be obtained, so
shareholders may have to wait a while....
D.C.: The “Wild Cat” has repeatedly asked
the co. for balance sheets, but none has been
received H.A.: See “‘Wild Cat’ Monthly,”
February, 1933 H.W.A.: It’s a small show
with prospects anything but bright; market fluc-
tuations are due mainly to the activity or other-
wise of professional operators T.T.: A
pamphlet on shale-oil is published by the N. S.
Wales Mines Department, price 10d., including
postage 3Y.H.: Registrar-General, Queen’s-
square, Sydney.... H.T.R.: (1) and (2) Yes.
(3) Yes, but not probable. (4) No X.Y.Z.:
The change means that the debenture-holder
would become one of the proprietors of the co.
instead of remaining, apparently, a secured
creditor. Since co.’s income is derived from
Australian sources, dividends are subject to
income tax; they may, however, be exempt
from special supertax or income from pro-
perty, provided the co. pays the tax and does
not elect to deduct it when paying pref. div.
R.H.C.: Shareholders have received regu-
lar dividends, and provision is being made to
safeguard their capital. The bonds are a long-
term speculation; impossible to say what bond-
holders are likely to get A.J.T.: Raub is the
only one worth holding.


SHADOW SHOWS.
“The Life Story of H.R.H. the Prince
of Wales,” at Sydney Prince Edward,
consists of episodes already seen in
gazettes, and others which seem familiar
though they are said to be screened pub-
licly for the first time in this film. The
Prince is shown in the hunting field, in
carriages, riding races; shaking hands
with miners, footballers, soldiers, poli-
ticians ; getting in and out of ’planes,
playing golf, watching native dances —a
nervy, smiling figure, radiating friendli-
ness.
The film begins with stills from the
family album, and some shots of an in-
vestiture which reveal, amongst other
things, how awful moving-pictures and
women’s hats were quarter of a century
ago. There is a fine panorama of the
Horse Guards’ parade ground at the end,
and some superb marching by Household
Brigade regiments, calculated to make
the blood of Prof. Einstein boil with con-
tempt.
Queen Victoria’s famous critique (“We
are not amused”) might be applied to
“It’s a Boy.” For the most part it is
unfunny without being vulgar. The plot
is one of those irresponsible affairs in
which the chief clowns need to be as
mad as Laurel and Hardy or Wheeler
and Woolsey. Edward Everett Horton is
good as a quiet drunk at the dinner
given him by some men-friends before
his marriage, but when the proceedings
warm up his reticence becomes almost
painful.
He and his best man, Leslie Henson,
are late for the wedding, and the fun is
based on their efforts to explain. They
blame one John Tempest, a novelist.
What more natural than that the bride’s
father should refuse to allow the wedding
to take place till they produce Tempest?
Obviously their only course is to per-
suade the boy blackmailer with the York-
shire accent who is posing as Horton’s
illegitimate son to impersonate the novel-
ist. Then the father discovers that
Tempest is a woman, so Henson is forced
to simper in shortly afterwards in female
attire.
The first-night audience was more or
less stunned with boredom at this stage,
but it sat up and roared when Henson
appeared. Most of the situations —kiss-
ing the unsuspecting girl, getting into a
room in which young women are un-
dressing, and so on —have been exploited
on thousands of stages in the past half-
century, but Henson gets plenty of laughs
out of them. The boy already men-
tioned, who looks like a sawn-off edi-
tion of the Prince, is also a first-class
female impersonator. The real women,
as in so many English farces, are stiff
and stagey.

If there is a Bible in Hollywood the
best-thumbed page in it must be that
containing the words “Whatsoever thy
hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.”
In “Emergency Call,” showing at Syd-
ney Capitol, graft in connection with
hospital administration is the target.
The head of the hospital is a racketeer’s
catspaw, who maintains on his office
wall a printed screed, wrongly ascribed
to Hippocrates, setting forth the high
ethics of the medical profession. Hero
of the ensuing melodrama is William
Boyd, who is an interne assigned to
ambulance duty. Put wise by William
Gargan, an ambulance-driver who loves
nurse Wynne Gibson —Gargan seems to
spend most of his time watching her
while she is on duty—the handsome
young surgeon incurs the enmity of the
political boss who makes millions out of
selling the hospital poison gas, mis-
labelled as ether, and who makes its
patients the prey of crook lawyers.
In retaliation the political boss procures
the assassination of Bill Gargan, person-
ally cracks the skull of Bill Boyd, and
murders the head of the hospital because
he won’t let Boyd be abolished with the
poison gas. Whereupon Wynne Gibson
assassinates the political boss with an
enormous revolver, and the fade-out
shows Bill Boyd and his bride attending
the opening of a ward erected to the
memory of the deceased ambulance-
driver. The fantasia is incredible all
through, but most incredible of all in
its presentation of hospital routine.
“The Narrow Corner,” on the same
bill, is a picturisation of a novel
in which Somerset Maugham displayed
his abysmal ignorance of Australia and
the Pacific. The first scene is laid in a
hotel in Sydney (in very recent years,
judging by the men’s attire) which is
open at a late hour and occupied by
drunken sailors who sing chanteys. The
majority of the patrons sit at little tables
* and drink beer out of o.s. wineglasses. As
ike as that is to a post-war Sydney bar
An® th e scenes in an unidentifiable island
off Papua—a mere dot on the map which
contains marble mansions built by the
Dutch pioneers and is officered .by Dutch
officers in French full-dress uniforms.
The younger Fairbanks, a fugitive
from justice—he shot a Sydney politician
—makes love in these surroundings to
Patricia Ellis, who wanders round in a
sarong that covers only two-thirds of
her anatomy. Ralph Bellamy, as a
Danish gentleman who conducts im-
portant commercial enterprises in this
tiny islet, is the lady’s fiance, and he
shoots himself when he discovers she has
fallen for young Doug. An elderly
opium-smoking doctor enlivens the con-
versation with terse philosophical reflec-
tions, and several large fire-engines and
millions of gallons of water must have
been used to make the seafaring episodes
sufficiently tempestuous. Fade-out shows
Doug and Patricia sailing out in a
schooner over a treacherous reef to face
a new and nobler life together.

In “This Week of Grace,” at Sydney
State, Gracie Fields bravely stands up
to the job of being what a modest pub-
licity agent calls “England’s foremost and
most versatile entertainer,” but Gracie
has to carry on her powdered shoulders
a dumpy and allegedly comic mother, a
beery father and a brother who might
be thought funny at a pinkie party.
THE EYES HAVE IT.
(1) Edward Everett Horton, (2) Leslie Henson, (3) Alfred Burdon in “It’s a
Boy,” at Sydney Prince Edward.
A dear old duchess, with white hair
and a stick, is reading a book in a
public park, when Gracie sits on the
seat beside her and mentions that she’s just
got the sack from the factory. She’s poor,
but she’s proud and she’s particular, as the
song says, and she scorns the duchess’s
offer of financial assistance. This in-
spires the duchess to send her bald-headed
and unintelligible lawyer with a document
which gives Gracie and her family the
custody of the duchess’s historic castle.
There, Gracie captivates Lord Swinford,
kicks the shins of his fiancee, and be-
comes Lady Bountiful to the duchess’s
estate. Brightest ray in the uninspired
phantasmagoria is Australia’s old friend
Nina Boucicault as the duchess.
The supporting picture is “Topaze,”
with John Barrymore as a dreamy,
kindly, utterly unpractical pedagogue in
horn-rimmed spectacles and picturesque
whiskers. He gets booted out of the
academy, is made the figurehead of
a swindling aerated-water concern, and
lends his name, Topaze, to the poison-
ous product. At the aerated-water
works he meets Myrna Loy, Coco for
short, and, as the subsequent develop-
ments require him to look a little less
eccentric, he is inspired by the arrival of
an envoy from France to shave off his
whiskers and dress in his most elegant
style, with top-hat complete. The rest
of the story is full of equally inexplicable
occurrences, but it all comes right in
the end.
* * *
In “Solitaire Man,” at Sydney Regent,
Herbert Marshall is a genteel crook who
lives by selling imitation gems to Ameri-
can tourists. His accomplices include
May Robson, as a somewhat battered-
looking dowager who usually loses her
ill-gotten gains at the gaming table;
Ralph Forbes, as a shell-shocked drug
addict, and Elizabeth Allan. Action com-
mences in France, where Marshall be-
comes involved in theft and murder com-
mitted by somebody else. Next scene is
the interior of a Paris-London air-liner,
where Mary Boland enters the picture.
Another latecomer is Lionel Atwill, who
might be either a detective or a crook.
The incidents in the aeroplane cabin, 2000
feet above the earth, are exciting. A fight
and a leap into the aerial abyss are items.
It is not until the ’plane lands in Eng-
land that the fate of Marshall’s gang is
decided. They go scot-free, resolving to
lead better and nobler lives in future.
In the other Regent attraction, “Her
Bodyguard,” Wynne Gibson is (not very
suitably) cast as a musicomedy star who
plays her smitten producer (Alan Dine-
hart) against a wealthy admirer (Edward
Arnold). Edmund Lowe is the retired
pugilist hired as her bodyguard. Mar-
jorie White and Johnny Hines impart
a bit of humor to an otherwise dull effort.
Sundry Shows
Audiences continue to get more than
they pay for at Clara Butt’s recitals. On
the first night the Sydney Town Hall
organ, which is the largest in Australasia,
and ought to know better, broke down
and refused to play. Last Saturday night,
Messrs. Lambert, Sisserman and Cohen
were just getting into their stride
with the opening number, the Rach-
maninoff “Elegiaque,” when there was a
discordant jangle—a piano-string had
broken. The three instrumentalists held
a brief conference, and judging by the
celerity with which a repair was effected
they decided merely to tie the broken
string back out of the way—there were
two other strings to carry the note. Later
it was violinist Phillip Cohen’s turn. He
didn’t break all his strings but one, a la
Paganini, but he came out without a
music-stand to play an obbligato, and a
human substitute for the metal tripod
had to be found. When one human
music-stand tired another took its place.
Dame Butt appeared to be suffering
from a cold at the beginning of the even-
ing, but her voice speedily cleared. She
repeated the numbers that had proved
most popular with the audiences at the
two preceding recitals. A matinee this
afternoon will conclude her season.
After about ten months’ absence from
Sydney “Our Miss Gibbs,” with Cyril
Ritchard and Madge Elliott, returned to
Sydney Royal on Saturday night. Why
the trifle was revived at all isn’t easily
explicable, but it is well cast and nicely
produced, and attracts audiences, mostly
composed of folk old enough to remem-
ber its first arrival a generation ago.

The recital of lyric verse at Melbourne
Queen’s Hall by the Misses Cardwell
and Marshall was a lugubrious affair,
partaking more of the nature of a dirge,
requiem or lament for lost opportunities
than an epithalamium or bridal song.
“Sister Helen,” a kind of duologue by
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, dealt with the
crime of witchcraft. A waxen image of
some individual was prepared and put
before a fire, and as it melted the victim
was supposed to fade away with gallop-
ing consumption. Miss Marshall, who
sat on the floor while her companion
conducted a clinical examination of her
condition, was presumably the Sister
Helen who faded away, but she was
too substantial a damsel to convey the
illusion. Miss Marshall also intoned the
“Death of Minnehaha,” from Long-
fellow’s jingle “Hiawatha,” and her elo-
cution was sufficiently good to have
triumphed over anything less painfully
monotonous. “Anthem for Doomed
Youth,” by Wilfred Owen, and “The
Dugout,” by Siegfried Sassoon, intoned
by Miss Cardwell, deepened the gloom,
though Hilaire Belloc’s “Tarantella”
brightened things up a bit.
* * *
“The Student Prince,” the only musical
comedy, in present critic’s experience,
with an unhappy ending, is raging at
Melbourne King’s, J.C.W.’s last remain-
ing home in Melbourne, with the excep-
tion of the closed Comedy. John Dudley
continues to present his Royal Highness
with a grand-opera voice and a deport-
ment which has grown steadily more
princely since the first night. The ball-
room scene continues to be as big a blaze
of magnificence as ever, and Cecil Kel-
leway’s Lootz earns respectful admira-
tion. Ex-Shakspearean Lorna Forbes
gains many hearty laughs by exposing
to public view a pair of the pagoda
drawers which were the correct wear of
the period.
* * *
“Mrs. Moonlight,” by Benn W. Levy,
which was produced by the Unnamed
Players at the Central Hall, Melbourne,
has much the same theme as Barrie’s
“Mary Rose.” A married woman wishes
to remain young and beautiful, and, as
she has a magical necklace in her hand
when she wishes, she stops growing old
at 28. The subsequent proceedings give
the playwright the opportunity for strik-
ing familiar notes of sentimentality,
with some excursions into the humor of
pathos. Some of the finer points were
lost in Isabel Wood’s alleged Scotch
accent. Otherwise the performance was
meritorious. As the lady with the curse
of perpetual youth on her, Nancye
Connell was sympathetic and unaffected,
and Laurence McCarthy, as the husband
who ought to have been pleased about
it, gave an impression of sincerity.
* * *
The best music in Melbourne is not
always to be heard in the vicinity of the
Town Hall. St. Peter’s Church, the
Anglo-Catholic establishment on Eastern
Hill, is steadily acquiring a reputation
for unusual excellence in this direction,
and it was considerably added to last
week with the performance of Mozart’s
Requiem by the Cecilia Choir, the Mel-
bourne Male Choir, the Lyric Choir and
the A.B.C. Symphony Orchestra under
the baton of Dr. Gerhard von Keussler,
the Prague conductor who has taken up
his residence in Melbourne. It is long
since anything quite as good has been
heard locally. Von Keussler is a bril-
liant musician who has the knack of
welding his executants into one body
while preserving the character of each
instrument, string, wood or vocal. He
has a faculty for lifting out of a score
a subtlety whose presence was hitherto
unsuspected, and, unlike the average con-
ductor, he is familiar enough with his
subject not to require the composer’s
printed directions. Soloists Muriel Cheek,
Sheila Marsden, Alan Mitchell and A. C.
Bartleman were on the whole not up
to the standard of the choralists, who, in
the fugue in the Hosanna chorus, sur-
passed themselves. Mozart died before
he had completed this work, which was
finished by another hand, but Von
Keussler’s production included parts said
to have been written by. Mozart himself,
subsequently lost and recently recovered
by the conductor.

Adelaide Repertory Theatre finished
its season by drawing on a new Spanish
author, G. M. Sierra, with Frank John-
ston producing. “Cradle Song” is a
simple (but too long-drawn-out) story
of a convent; a baby girl is left on the
doorstep, and 18 years later goes off to
be happily married. This final scene,
where the little community is losing its
one ray of sunshine, was made poignant
by Patricia Hackett as the nun who
mothered the foundling from its arrival.
Others who scored were Beryl Kook as
prioress, Ethelwyn Robin as a sarcastic
old nun, and Cyril Riley as the one privi-
leged male visitor, the doctor. A curtain-
raiser, “The Lover,” by the same author,
can be commended to all amateur
societies. It is the quaint dialogue of a
queen and a humble cheese-making
admirer, who has beggared himself in
following her everywhere, and will
accept a season ticket on the railways as
sole and sufficient reward. Elizabeth
Campbell and Robert Matthews did it
full justice.
# * *
Laurence Macaulay, who gave a re-
cital at Sydney Assembly Hall on Satur-
day night, is a baritone with a rich,
resonant voice and a robust taste in
music. His offerings included “Scots
Wha Hae,” “The Sword of Ferrara,”
and Schubert’s “Wanderer.”

ABORIGINALITIES
“O. W. Waireki”: I asked Henare how
his farm was going. “Ho,” he sighed,
“it soon pe gone. I’m mortgaged right
up to te missus.”
* * * *
“Cadi”: On a station west of Bourke
there once upon a time reigned a manager
of few words and iron soul. A rouse-
about on the place lost his axe in the
mulga scrub and, with many misgivings,
told the boss. “That’s all right; you’ll
find it again,” was the curt reply. Set-
tling-up time came, and the rousie
entered the office to be paid off. “Wot’s
this ’ere, boss?” he inquired, pointing to
an item —“Dr., one axe, 12s. 6d.” “That’s
the axe you lost, me lad,” said the
manager. “I told you you’d find it
again.”
* * * *
“Urodela”: Afraid “Tamornie” has
tangled himself up over the axolotl (B.
15/11/’33). In the first place it isn’t a
fish or a fish’s bootlace, being one of the
big tribe of the salamanders, lizard-like
DAD: “Wot the blazes did yer swerve like that for?”
CHOOM : “I had to choose between us and the poor little rabbit, sir.”
beasts which are in an order of their own.
These creatures have the curious capa-
city, unknown elsewhere outside the in-
sect world, of passing through a larval
stage before reaching maturity. In the
larval stage they are water-breathers
equipped with gills. The adults become
air-breathers, the gills vanishing and lungs
being developed. The axolotl is apart
from the rest of his family as being able
to breed in the larval stage. He will
continue in this arrested stage of develop-
ment as long as his water supply is plenti-
ful. If it is reduced, he becomes an air-
breathing amphibian able to live ashore
or in the water as the fancy takes him.
* * * *
“Ornis”: Australia does emulate Egypt
and cultivate a respect for the white ibis
(B. 15/11 /’33), and not only this parti-
cular variety of the family but also the
thorn-necked and black-backed sorts. All
of them are eaters not only of the fluke-
bearing water snail and grasshoppers,
but of the much more insidious wire-
worm, which attacks the root of our
grasses. Ibises will feed over a wireworm-
infested grass area, if undisturbed, like a
flock of sheep grazing. In western
Queensland I cannot recall the time when
this function of the bird was not recog-
nised and its sanctity respected by sheep-
men. The ibis tribe is protected by law
on this account throughout Australia.
“Frigid,” who saw someone shoot one
flying overhead, should have reported the
murderer to the nearest John Hop.
sfc H 1 H*
“Never Never”: One of Australia’s
rarest birds, and certainly the least-known
to the amateur naturalist, is the jabiru,
the lonely and long-legged fowl which is
the sole representative in this continent
of the great stork family. He is a bird
of the North Queensland swamps, always,
outside the breeding season, seen on his
melancholy own, though occasionally a
specimen is fool enough to come as
far south as the semi-tropical N.S.W.
Northern Rivers —to be there promptly
shot and described in the Sydney press as
an extraordinary “crane” which must
have escaped from some travelling
menagerie. There are two representatives
of the family at Taronga, but they are a
bit elusive. For some time the Zoo people
tried keeping them, like other storks, in
enclosures. This was so distasteful to the
gloomy pair that it was decided to give
them an open go. Wing-clipping ceased
and in due time the birds took the air.
When hordes of visitors make the Zoo
atmosphere unpleasant to these solitaries
they take wing and cruise round the
harbor. Always they are back at tucker-
time.
* * * *
“Kopina Kava”: I heard a lot about the
“bush telegraph” and the supernatural
way in which news of important happen-
ings is received over long distances by
natives in New Guinea before I went
there; but, after several years’ resi-
dence, I’ve obtained no evidence of it.
I know of only two methods of send-
ing messages in Papua—calling from
mountain-top to mountain-top, and
using the sounding-board of the big
rivers, such as the Purari. With the
former method I have sent a message
four days’ march away and received an
answer the next day. The sounding-
board (named tserei by the Turoha tribe
of Middle Purari) is an oblong piece of
heavy timber, flat on top and concave
below, with a hollow in the middle four
to five inches deep. The operator sits on
the ground with legs wide and extended ;
one end of the tserei stands on a short
peg driven into the ground, the other
rests on the hips of the native. A
large, elongated piece of granite is used
to beat out the messages. On a still
night on the upper reaches of the Purari
I have heard the sound-beats coming
from a Turoha settlement 15 miles up
river.
“Elaps”: That reference to scientific
progress in the matter of antidotes
to snake venom (B. 8/11/’33) reminds
me that Australian investigators working
under the terms of the Walter Hall Trust
in Melbourne have developed two or
three reliable anti-venines. The trouble is
that these are only effective against
poisoning by the variety of snake whose
venom is used as the basis of the serum.
This was interestingly illustrated the other
day in Sydney, when a man bitten in the
rough country at the head of Middle Har-
bor was borne by his mates, after the
usual rough measures of incising and
ligaturing had been carried out, to the
North Shore Hospital. He was treated
there, but though the hospital had sup-
plies of anti-venine it could not be ad-
ministered, the man having failed to
identify the variety of snake that nipped
him.
* * * *
“Ela Tauna”: There is quite a war
going on these days between Papua and
Mandated Territory. It has become so
heated that it might come to Guinea
Airways pilots dropping election eggs on
Moresby any day while on their cross-
territory flights. Who started the thing
is hard to say. Perhaps some wealthy
Edie Creek miner, in company with a
patrol officer of Mandated Territory,
“I believe Nero was torturing the Christians again last night ”
“Yes; someone ought to take that fiddle off him.”
passed a disparaging remark about
Moresby when passing through that tropi-
cal seat of learning. It is argued now
that Papua, though poor in gold, is rich
in administration. Papua is antiquated,
says Mandated Territory. Papua’s reply
is that, though she still uses the tent and
fly that Humphries had on his Morobe
expedition, she does not get her patrol
officers ambushed. So it goes on, and the
only solution that appears is for Papua
to find gold. However, it would be still
worth while to wager that Hubert
Murray can walk faster than General
Griffiths.
* * * *
“Goburra”: On the Buffalo and
Bogong Plateau (Vic.) a bullock’s skele-
ton is sometimes met with firmly wedged
in the branches of a snow-gum at a height
of 15ft. or more. Large herds are pas-
tured on these plains in summer and are
removed about Easter. Then comes the
snow. The skeletons in the trees are
those of stragglers left behind. In walk-
ing over the snowdrifts in the gullies they
have fallen through weak spots and
become caught in the underlying
branches.
* * * *
“Billy See”: Death comes to the miner
in unexpected guises. Descending a long-
abandoned mine at Kookynie (W.A.) the
other day, an old battler paused on the
No. 1 level to light his candle, dropping
the match casually to the ground. In-
stantly he was enveloped in a tornado of
fire, which stripped him of all clothing
except his belt and his boots and left
him a corpse. The inquest elicited that
when the mine had closed down 20 years
previously a quantity of blasting-powder
was spilt on the floor of the drive, and
there it had waited, undeteriorated in
bone-dry earth, for the coming of the
spark that would set it ablaze.
* * * *
“A Major”: It is said of the African
negro that he has such a nice sense of
harmony that if he accidentally sits on
the keys of a pianoforte he manages to
strike a proper chord. I’m beginning to
think the Australian abo. must be a bit
like that. My experience is scanty, I’ll
admit. I met my first abo. musician in
Sydney’s George-street. He was blowing
a gumleaf, and with that inadequate
equipment could be heard, above all
the maddening clatter of that thorough-
fare, for a good 100 yards. He seemed
to have a repertoire of hymns (from the
A. and M. collection) and songs popular
forty years ago, such as “Daisy Bell”
and “Two Little Girls in Blue.” None
of his tunes was true to score —some
were so far out that identification was
a matter calling for some attention—but
he was right on the pitch all the time,
and he linked up the scattered bits he
could remember with passages as suave
and as appropriate as any fifth-year Con.
student could have devised. A gift like
that is rare with street musicians of the
superior race,

“Tiki”: If you want to keep on good
terms with any of the few surviving
veterans of the Maori wars don’t men-
tion the Siege of Parihaka. There was a
celebration of the anniversary of that
victory this year, but it was confined to
Maoris. At Parihaka, on November 6,
1881, there assembled 2500 brown-
skinned folk, mostly women and chil-
dren, followers of the malcontents Te
Whiti and Tohu. Well-armed troops, led
by the fire-eating Major Atkinson,
marched on this small remnant. Te Whiti
preached peace to his people—peace
and forbearance. If he had counselled
resistance they would have fought, no
matter what the odds, but orders were
orders. “The future is mine,” said Te
Whiti, “and, though I am killed, I yet
shall live. Ask the little children of the
future who made the peace they live
in, and they shall reply ‘Te Whiti’ and
bless his name.” It was so. The little
Maori remnant sat like graven images
while field-guns were trained upon them
and red-coated soldiers in orderly array
marched upon them. Te Whiti and Tohu
and a hundred of their followers were
arrested; Maori whares were looted;
the Riot Act was read ; the Maoris were
mustered like drafts of sheep and driven
in different directions. What it cost a
brave and warlike people to suffer that
without so much as an angry look or
word can’t be estimated. As a historian
has said, “Such a feat of dignified passive
resistance was never before performed
by a savage race.” Te Whiti prevailed.
There was peace ever afterwards, and his
race, then so near extermination, sur-
vived. Now, in the third generation since
Te Whiti’s day, it has seen the remedy-
ing of some of its ancient wrongs, has
seen justice done to the memory of Te
Whiti, and is commencing once again to
increase and multiply.

“Creel”: A deep-sea fish occasionally
seen by the divers in Australia’s northern
waters is the “headlight-fish,” which
grows to an average length of about 4ft.
It has two lights, like the lamps of a
motor-car in miniature, one below each
eye. Above each is a movable flap
which the fish can slip over at will, cut-
ting off the illumination.
* * * *
“Ahem”: Wandering through a
Westralian village the other day I was
reminded of Longfellow’s smith. A red-
gum took the place of the spreading
chestnut-tree, but there were the mighty
smith, the children round the open door,
the flying sparks and bellows’ roar. And
as a real Yankee touch all the kiddies’
jaws were going like ruminating cows.
As I approached, one urchin solemnly
extracted his chew and handed it to the
smith, who reached up and parked it on
the roof. This rite was performed again
and again. When the smith observed
me I suppose my face was a note of
interrogation, for he remarked, “Second-
hand iron, and you can’t beat chewing-
gum for covering the cracks.” Needless
to say, the smith provided the packets of
gum.
CHRISTMAS BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Governor Macquarie’s officers were the first to use
Christmas bush for decorative purposes.”
The Old Land’s near to the time of year when
holly berries will redly glow
On the festal board, and out in the hall they’ll
hang the sacred mistletoe.
New lands, new ways. In Macquarie’s days
they had to hit on a symbol new
For the Christmastime in a sunny clime where
none of the Old-World flora grew.
It was rugged ground that they quested round
—but maybe they hadn’t far to push
When into the ken of the soldier men came
the gleam and glory of Christmas bush.
The cult of the mistletoe goes back to Pagan
days and to Druids’ oaks;
And the blood ran red, beneath fit shed, by
those prehistoric priestly blokes,
So the legend goes, at least. Who knows?
There’s little trace of their creed survives.
In fact, there’s nought but the shuddersome
thought of sacrificial stones and knives.
And, though memory cleaves to holly leaves,
there’s nothing about ’em soft or “cush.”
Gum-tips, in lieu, or wattle will do, and the
mistle yields to the Christmas bush.
Then here’s to the long-dead “caps.” and
“lieuts.,” Lachlan Macquarie’s little lot,
Who found us the Yuletide substitute in a land
where the old-time props were not.
Did they cry “Eureka! ” I wonder, when as
they strained and sweated through wood-
land ways,
The calyx lobes in the rich red robes of C.
gummiferum met their gaze?
Oh, the mistletoe has its use, you know, but it’s
iust as easy to steer or push
A pliable miss for a snapshot kiss beneath a
bit of our Christmas bush.
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“0.W.W.”: The new hand, who was
to be given his second lesson in killing
the ration sheep, came and informed
Dad that the “ole girl was ready to skin.”
“How did yer manage to cut ’er throat?”
Dad asked. “I didn’t,” the lad replied.
“I killed ’er like you said, sir. You
said old ewes was better ’ung for a while,
so I ’ung ’er at dawn.”

“Dai R.”: An artful puss and a cow to
work (and lay and whistle) is Mrs. Green
Turtle, of North Queensland. Some time
ago my musings in the murk were
smithereened by a portly dame of the
tribe who waddled out of the vasty deep
near Cairns, and without any preamble
began to dig like one o’clock, smothering
me with sand. Having subterraned for
about twenty minutes to an accompani-
ment of stertorous respiration, she
stopped and regarded the outlook
appraisingly. Then away she went again
for half an hour, still snorting. Followed
a short rest in silence, suddenly rent by
a noise like a whistling-kettle in action,
which, I discovered later, was the laying
tune. While it lasted (which was getting
well on for an hour) a gentle trembling
agitated Mrs. Turtle’s frame. Finally the
old girl clambered out and, working her
hind legs vigorously, filled the business in ;
then she slithered a few yards away and
“Does yer ’usband take anythink with his meals?”
“Well, at the last pub ’e fed at ’e took a wunnerful lot o’ cutlery.”
started digging again. I began to investi-
gate the scene of the first operation, and
coming back she lent the eye the aspect
of the tiger and generally flounced round
as if I’d asked her age or suggested she
wasn’t married. However, I found 117
epgs. When I covered them again she
went on with another excavation a foot
deep, left it open, and hopped it back to
sea. Evidently the second hole is intended
as a false scent for potential egg
gourmands.
“Lao-dah”: Centralia isn’t the only
region where the camel’s capacity for
traversing sand is appreciated. A man
who makes a living gathering shells for
garden paths in Melbourne uses the
humped ruminant for conveying his spoil
from the beach at Portland, Vic.
* * * *
“Tenrag”: Tuwehirangi, a wahine liv-
ing at Manutahi, near Hawera (M.L.),
may not be the oldest living woman, but
I’ll back her to be the most active of her
age. She was married 97 years ago and
is estimated to be 115 now. Tuwehirangi
still walks to and from the store a mile
distant from her dwelling, keeps her
garden in order and chops her own fire-
wood. She has been married twice, but
has outlived her husbands and all her
children. She lives at the pah with her
people, of the sub-tribe of Ngati-Takou,
and speaks no English.
* * * *
“Lofty”: The shark-fishing industry
started a year ago on the coast between
Sydney and Newcastle has received a
serious setback. A parasitical worm,
breeding in the abundant offal, has
turned its attention to living sharks, and
makes these unfit for use. The worm
eats through hide and flesh, and has
made it necessary for the industry to
look for pastures new. A likely spot
has been selected outside Bowen, on the
Great Barrier Reef. An experimental
line set off Grassy Island caught, in addi-
tion to tigers, hammerheads, leopards
and sleepies, a grey nurse 18ft. 6in. long,
with a girth of 10ft. 4in.
**■ * *
“C. Coral”: One of the difficulties of
language translation in Papua is that a
word may have different meanings in
different languages. For instance, the
Wedanan tribe had to find a word to
express the terms of that Commandment
which deals with unfaithful partners in
marriage or those who transgress the
bounds of platonic friendship. They
devised quite a good word for adultery.
But their neighbors of Mukawa, a bit
further along, had exactly the same word
with another significance; in effect, it'
was “Thou shalt not anchor thy canoe
over the place where thy friend is fish-
ing.”
H*
“Dr. Mivart”: While I was shaving
the other morning a large spider (I sus-
pect of the family Argiopidce, but of a
genus with which I am unacquainted)
made his appearance on my bedroom
wall within reach of my hand. He was
a well-nourished, particularly shapely
chap, and I grabbed a reading-glass and
had a good look at him. He had a good
look at me, too, his six eyes gleaming
like little diamonds. He showed abso-
lutely no fear, and had no need to ; I
don’t kill non-poisonous spiders. After
our mutual microscopic inspection I re-
sumed shaving, and Mr. Spider moved a
bit closer to watch the operation. Then,
on rubber shoes, in came my young
hopeful, Theophilus. He stood and
gazed at Mr. Spider quite movelessly and
silently, but 1 could sense, forming in
his feral brain, a plot of assassination.
And then, miraculously, Mr. Spider
wasn’t there ! Theophilus, expressing dis-
gust, borrowed my best pocket-knife and
departed, and I went on shaving. A
second or two later Mr. Spider was back
in his place on the wall. How the devil
did he know that Theophilus is blood-
thirsty and 1 am not?
“Yes, I AM ‘slingiri it up at yer.’ You bin out of work for years, and if it
hadn't been for that bucket up at the big house I dunno where we’d
been."
“Willeroo”: The stings of the pestilent
“bluebottle,” or Portuguese man-o’-war,
which has lately been the bane of thou-
sands of Sydney surf-bathers, are com-
posed of thousands of poisoned darts,
situated in the tentacles or streamers,
some of which extend to more than 30ft.
As soon as the body touches one of them
the darts shoot out and become em-
bedded in the skin. The blue bag is use-
less as a remedy. Binghi’s cure —the
fleshy leaves of the pigface plant, which
grows along the sandy seashores —is the
best; failing that, wet sand, rubbed in till
the skin is raw.
* * * *
“Jaccart”: A Southland (M.L.) cow
cocky of my acquaintance had an in-
fallible method of breaking-in wild
heifers. A small hand winch, bought at
the sale of a dismantled gold dredge,
was anchored at the back of the cowshed.
A wire rope was taken from the winch
through a hole in the back of the shed
to the yard, where it was hitched to a
rope thrown around the heifer’s horns.
With one man on the winch and another
behind her with a stick Strawberry just
had to go into the bail. If she sulked
and lay down to it there was no let up
on the strain ; they dragged her in along
the ground. A bit rough, but it saved a
lot of trouble afterwards.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : An icy sceptical eye has been
turned by many on Robert Kaleski’s
claim that the dingo is the father of all
dogs. These people cling to the idea
that pretty well everything in this country
must have come from somewhere else.
One thing has been definitely proved: that
the dingo goes back beyond the remotest
traces of man. So far the great fossil
beds of Australia have been very little
explored. It may yet be shown that Aus-
tralia was the cradle of much of the
world’s fauna. There is a living evidence
in the platypus, which is a little more
than half-way between the reptilian and
mammalian kingdoms, and found no-
where else. The duckbill and the echidna
are the only two egg-laying mammals.
Then there are the lungfish and the mud-
skipper, or climbing fish, of N.Q. Again,
Australia has more species of birds than
any other land, a great many of them
peculiar to the country, ranging from the
most primitive—the mound builders —to
the most highly developed —the bell
magpies.
* * * *
“Budgeree”: Here’s a sure way of
locating a bees’ nest. Trap a few bees
in a pickle bottle, hold it in front of you,
and observe the side of the bottle on
which the bees cluster. Steer your course
by that.
* * * *
“8.J.”: In the parts of Central Queens-
land where stock depend on water con-
served in dams, the goanna is a nuisance.
His pet pastime is tunnelling through the
banks, and he is sometimes successful in
wasting the year’s water supply. Despite
the good-conduct marks he receives in
southern areas, his sable reputation is
well merited in the sheep country. Some
time ago, on riding up to a drying water-
hole, I found a representative of the tribe
feasting from the flesh of a live sheep
that had bogged at the water’s edge. Un-
abashed, he merely threw a casual glance
in my direction, and would have gone
on with the game but that I diverted him
with a waddy. Though allegedly a
scavenger the Bananaland go. must pre-
fer fresh mutton, for at the time there was
no scarcity of odoriferous woolly victims
of the drought,

“H.S.”: Rambling through Sydney
Botanic Gardens I came on a specimen
of an Australian native cherry-tree, its
green foliage brightened with the red and
reddening fruit that puzzled our early
colonists because the cherry-stone was
outside the pulp. When I was a Sydney
nipper 60 years ago, and the bush was
easily reached in any direction, wild
cherries were plentiful where now there
is nothing but streets. Wild-cherry
hunting, “five-cornering” and native-cur-
rant gathering were common pleasures
of the youngsters of those days. “Wag-
ging” it when “five corners” were in was
a popular pastime, and wild cherries came
next in order among bush lures.
* * H= *
“Barangkali”: In the verandah roof
of my week-end shack at Bundeena
(N.S.W.) a colony of white ants made its
abode. An ancient inhabitant showed me
the best method of removing them. The
most tedious part of the job was the lay-
ing of a fine honey trail from a black
ants’ nest, a few yards away, to where
the termites were working. In three
hours I had the ants almost to the in-
fested timber and next morning I brought
them right on to the pests. Immediately
the termites were discovered the honey
was forgotten, and the little black demons
set to work on a war of extermination.
They investigated each hole and cranny
in the crumbling rafters, a steady stream
going and coming from the nest, each
ant loaded with a termite or portion
of one. Those who had deposited their
load in the storeroom hastened back at
the double, hoping that the supply of
termites had not failed during their
absence. The following week-end I cut
out the affected pieces of timber. Not a
white ant or egg remained.
* * * *
“Hornby”: An impolite vegetable is a
toadstool that abounds among the
swamps of North Queensland and
Arnhem Land. When fully ripe it is about
nine inches in diameter and of a bright
golden color, and sports deep magenta
spots at regular intervals of about a quar-
ter of an inch. It will tolerate any amount
of stamping round its vicinity without vis-
ible disapproval, but when its alluring
appearance induces the uninitiated to peer
so closely that his breath touches it it
bursts in his face, nearly choking him
with fine dust smelling like long-defunct
crocodile. The blacks use the powder
to anoint themselves as an expression
of grief at relatives’ death-beds. I once
inadvertently got a shower of it myself,
and T expressed grief for a fortnight
afterwards.

Amazing'
Effect of
Yeast Treatment
Remarkable medical discoveries have re-
cently been made. Great scientists, like
Voronoff and Steinach, have combatted
the problem of premature old age and the
decline of health and efficiency in the
human machine, with astonishing results.
Perhaps stC 1 more striking, from the view-point of every-
day utility, has been the success attending the introduction
of vitamines, through the medium of a special type of Yeast.
It is now established that these "vitamines” form the key-
stone of Life and Health—without them real
health (to say nothing of clear skin) becomes
impossible! Scientific experiments have proven
beyond doubt that active yeast contains an
element of amazing restorative, life - giving
power.
Rapid change from ill-health to
forceful Youth and Vigor
By means of a tiny proportion of this con-
centrated yeast substance (1/15-thousandth of
an ounce ) paralysed pigeons have been cured
in a few hours! 200 lbs. of active yeast produce less than
an ounce of the super-active substance, which is the real
life-giver l This is, as it were, the vital part or “Cream”
of the Yeast — quite different to brewers’’ yeast —a super-
concentration that can bring about the rapid magic change
from ill-health to forceful Youth, Vitality and Vigor.
Yeast is Life
The Most
Effective
Form is
Cream of Yeast
A Phenomenon—Yet Scientifically proven
beyond doubt
Consider what the capturing of such a wonderful substance
means to weak, jaded, run-down men and women! And it
has been captured! In Cream of Yeast, active yeast is now
harnessed to other medicinal agents of known value, in a
form which makes it the ideal remedy for everyday ills!
The organisation manufacturing “Cream of Yeast” is the
largest in the world producing any form of activated yeast.
It has the largest staffs of scientific chemists; has the
greatest chemical and financial resources, and actually made
several millions of vitamine tablets in the course of work
leading up to the great triumph achieved in “Cream of
Yeast.”
Cream of Yeast a great advance on
other forms of Yeast
Since only a tiny proportion of the yeast is
especially valuable, it will be understood why
“Cream of Yeast” is so superior to any other
kind of yeast available. “Cream of Yeast”
supplies, in handy tablet form, the most active
known concentration of effective yeast and
recuperative agents — “Cream of Yeast” so
scientifically incorporates the vital active yeast
with other acknowledged restorative, energy-
giving and pain-quelling agents that the power
of the yeast itself is vastly increased and the promptness of
benefit greatly accelerated. Not only will “Cream of Yeast”
calm the nerves of the most hysterical; not only will it
bring sweet, refreshing sleep to the sleepless, but it will
quickly clear complexions, and will make anyone feel fresher
and brighter in a few minutes. Further —it offers the
following unrivalled advantages:—
Some of the Remarkable Benefits available through Cream of Yeast
"CREAM OF YEAST” WILL STOP
Acidity, Heartburn, Indigestion, Dyspepsia in 3 mins.
Headaches, Dizziness, Neuralgia, etc., - - in 4 mins.
Depression, Irritability, Brain Fag, etc. - - in 8 mins.

ULTIMATUM.
The Chairman of the International
Convention of Journalists addressed the
conference: “Gentlemen! Our profes-
sion, which has suffered in silence the
encroachments of doctors, politicians,
self-advertising society matrons and
Ks.C., is now faced with the greatest
menace in its history. We must
fight these new invaders on their
own ground. (A pplause.) We
must adopt the offensive! We
must attack! (Cheers.)
“I therefore urge that we com-
municate with Bradman, Lar-
wood, Jardine and Crawford,
warning them that if they don’t
immediately withdraw from the
journalistic field they will have to
face competition from our mem-
bers in their own spheres.”

THE PUNTER’S DAUGHTER.
Poor child, she stood there sobbing,
broken-hearted,
Her little angel-face all wet with tears;
Appalling was the story she imparted
When she had overcome her childish
fears.
“Ah, sir,” she sobbed, “our home is full

Since daddy put the rent on ’Opeless

break) “t’-morrer

Oh, little Bill an’ Jim are growin' thinner,
An’ so is dad an’ mum an’ Bess ah

To buy a ticket in th’ lotteree !”

ENCHANTED MUSIC.
There are sounds that hold my heart in
thrall: ,
A lovely woman’s passionate sighs,
The click of a bat when it meets the ball
And a sizzling “four” to the boundary
flies.
The bush birds’ songs cause my soul to
glow i
I love the locust that shrills and stops ;
But the sweetest of all the sounds I
know
Is the sound one hears when a bottle
pops.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
A plunge on Nipper in the youngsters’
race was a feature of the Warwick Farm
meeting. Nipper, a brother to The
Doctor’s Orders, was backed from eights
to 7 to 2. It was his first outing, and,
favored with a nice run on the rails
throughout, he landed the money; but
the runner-up, Rossinver, met with a
check at the turn, and had to go round
three horses. The winner is raced on
lease by J. T. Jamieson, and was bred
by Hunter White.
The Farm-trained Multudo, selected by
The Bulletin for the Horsley Handicap,
was at a great price early in the betting—•
eights. He closed at sixes owing to sup-
port for Veilantif, who was backed from
twelves in the paddock and fourteens in
the Leger to 11 to 2. Multudo gave
Darby Munro a comfortable ride to score
easily from Omagh and Burracootboo,
who looked big and burly. Veilantif
met with interference ; Brazenface found
the pace too hot.
Dan Buffier was confident that his
Spearhead gelding Prowler (7 to 2) would
win the November Handicap, and win
he did. Jumping away well, Prowler set
up a good lead at each turn, and easily
settled Cherbourg and Bill Wedgewood
at the finish. Prowler is bred to stay on
both sides of his pedigree, and as trainer

Mackinnon has him in excellent trim he

Ranchero, at evens for the Leumeah
Handicap after twos had been laid, was
a good thing beaten. McCarten, a bit too
confident, allowed him to drop right out
at the five furlongs. Mesha and Persian
are not genuine milers, but they got a
break on the field turning for home,
where Ranchero was hemmed in on the
rails. When the latter got out he fairly
flew, and in a great finish Mesha beat
Persian by a head, with Ranchero on the
outside, half a head away. Whitsome,
from Victoria, ran promisingly and may
be a Villiers possibility.
Trainer Peter Lawson was compen-
sated for Rossinver’s defeat when the
Heroic mare Fame (7 to 2) narrowly
won the Three- and Four-year-old from
the Newcastle-owned Venusta and
Buonarroti. The favorite, Assertive,
essayed to win all the way as he did at
Canterbury, but he had had enough when
the Leger was reached.
Ridden by the ex-Victorian apprentice
Baldwin, Oliora (7 to 1), a nice type of
four-year-old horse by Magpie from the
Newmarket winner Red Dome, captured
the first division of the Maiden in good
style from Lady Linbul and Dark Bird,
also by Magpie. Oliora is owned by Alan
Cooper, who also races Amounis’s

* * * *
Donohoe, the Randwick trainer, won
the Stansmore Two-year-old at Caulfield
with Arachne, whom he trains for Nor-
man Robinson, nephew of the late Lionel
Robinson. Bred in N. S. Wales, Arachne
is by Corban from Welkin Queen, by
The Welkin from Wilga (imp.). She
fetched only 75gns. at the Easter sales
in Sydney and has proved a bargain.
Two Arachne wagers noted were £l2OO
to £BOO and £750 to £5OO. Ridden by
the apprentice jockey R. Cook, the filly
had the race in her keeping before the
home turn was reached and lowered the
course record for five furlongs to 59|sec.
Dpnohoe intends to give her a spell
before the autumn.
The Armadale Handicap went to the
Sydney-owned Bold Boy, who belongs
to J. W. Cook, but for several weeks past
has been in the Flemington stable of J.
M. Murphy. The success of Bold Boy
was due to Skidmore’s splendid riding.
He kept his mount in a nice position
throughout, and after taking charge in
the straight Bold Boy had enough in
hand to stall off a late challenge from
Celotex by half a length. Celotex, who
belongs to F. H. Lewis and was ridden
by Bob Lewis, the evergreen jockey, was
backed from 14 to 1 to 7 to 2. The
gelding sustained a severe check at the
mile post and had a rocky passage from
that stage until taken to the outside of
the field three furlongs from home. He
made up ground at phenomenal speed in
the straight. Celotex won the Birthday
Cup in Adelaide last June, and is sure
to pay his way on Melbourne courses.
Bold Boy was lucky ; Dermid in the
Ormond Stakes was not. Donohoe’s
horse was not harshly handicapped at
9st. 121 b to 9st. 71b. by an
apprentice allowance —and the owner-
trainer wagered on him with confidence.
The distance was 8i furlongs. Dermid
was too far back (fifth) at the home turn,
but he would have pulled through all
right if Cook had not shifted his ground
twice in the straight and ended up by
being squeezed for room on the rails.
Yaropian, a horse that had gone down in
very moderate company at Ascot three
days before, finished brilliantly to van-
quish the pacemaker, Glideaway, by
three-quarters of a length, with Dermid
a similar distance farther away.
With Inkson temporarily incapacitated,
L. J. Hynes is the foremost jumping rider
in Melbourne. The former Sydney horse-
man landed the Kasouka Hurdle on
Walter Scott and the Tara Steeplechase
on old Gudroon. Latter took 2sec. off
the course record for two miles over
fences. Walter Scott is a stable-com-
panion of the Williams town Cup winner
Shadow King, and was backed from 7
to 1 down to 5 to 2. Cudroon started at
12 to 1.
M. (and Rafferty) Rules
Wally Hancock, now a veteran, is back
in Sydney and boxing well. He was too
fast for Frank Snelson, a highly-thought-
of North Sydney welterweight, in Snel-
son’s home suburb, and collected the
decision on points.
* * * *
Australian Joe Dawson had the advan-
tage in condition when he met Lurich at
Leichhardt. The Russian submitted to
a Boston crab in the third round, and
cries of “Fish-o! ” were heard when
Lurich made the score even with a body
scissors in the fifth. They spent the last
round mauling one another on the mat.
A draw.
Ins and Outs
The second testimonial-trial match in
Sydney proved little livelier than the first
in Melbourne, though there was some
local interest in that N.S.W. tackled the
Rest. The end of Friday saw Ma dis-
missed for a patchy 273 ; McCabe, twice
missed behind the sticks, made 110. The
best shot of the innings was a taking 66
by left-hander Rowe. Ebeling repeated
his Melbourne success with a well-earned
bae of 5 for 66. Chilvers (2-69) also
bowled really well, but had bad luck,
Walker was uncertain, yet finished with
five catches to his credit.
The Rest, led by Woodfull, shaped
little better to get 255 in their first hit.
Like Bradman in the N.S.W. knock,
Woodfull went early. Ponsford batted
very soundly for 70, and then the four
left-handers in a row, O’Brien, Darling,
Nitschke and Bromley, added 47 between
them. Six were down for 138 when Lee
(69) came to the rescue.
• V
O’Reilly and Mair took three wickets
each Both bowled well, but owed much
o{ their tmmumty from punishment to
the timidity of most of the batsmen
opposing them. At tea on Monday
N.S.W. was 4 for 256 ; Bradman made 92
and Fingleton 68. Ebeling dismissed both.
“Airrhnrth” • meetim? of the Fmi-
Aigbuith . A meeting ol the hug
lish county captains at Lord s m con-
junction with the advisory committee and
the English board controlling the Tests
hammered what we all hope is the last

constituting an attack on the batsman
was contrary to the spirit of cricket, and
the matter was left to the captains “in
the complete confidence that they will
not permit or countenance such bowling.
“Tenth Slip”: What the soldiers would
call “operation orders” have been issued
by the Board of Control to cover the
period between the Australian Eleven’s
assembly in Melbourne on March 9 and
its departure from Perth on March 26.
The party will leave Melbourne for
Hobart on March 10 and play two
matches against Tassie, at Launceston and
Hobart respectively. Then back to Mel-
bourne and westwards by the transcon-
tinental express. At Perth a three-day
match will be played against Westralia.
Manager Bushby and treasurer Bull will
be the Australian representatives at the
Imperial Cricket Conference.

“Wollard”: Launceston (Tas.) Cricket
Club, with 90 years’ continuous activity
behind it, claims to be the second oldest
club in Australia, Melbourne C. C. win-
ning with 95 years. The L.C.C. was re-
constructed in 1843 and there are records
of matches played in 1840. In 1851 it
defeated Victoria in the first inter-
colonial match.
(Continued on page 26.)
Racquet and Bawl
Perry won the Victorian singles cham-
pionship from Crawford on Saturday in
no uncertain fashion, taking three sets
to one, or 20 games to 17. Four games
in arrears in the opening set, he then
took six in succession and the set. He
dropped the second set 2-6, but won the
third and fourth 6-4, 6-3. Crawford
got something back with Hopman’s
help, the pair winning the doubles from
Hughes and Lee, and Crawford took
the mixed doubles with his wife as a
partner. Joan Hartigan won the women s
singles.
* * * *
“N’lmporte”: In a tournament at Le
Touquet the German player Prenn, after
leading by a set in the singles, chucked
the match on the ground that he wanted
to go to the races. At the same tourney,
Legeay, who had been Prenn’s opponent
in that match, defaulted after he had won
two sets and was leading in the third. He
explained that his opponent, Lesueur,
had won the trophy they were playing
for twice and that he had decided to
give him a third win and permanent pos-
session as an indication of camaraderie.
It’s a shame to think about what Aus-
tralian tennis officials would do if players
here staged performances like that,
though, goodness knows, they put up
with a lot of nonsense.
“Top Spin”: Worth noting how many
tennis players of note have taken to golf
in recent years. Good cricketers are
usually good golfers if they start early
enough, but it has been another story
with the racquet and bawl game. To-day
players of the calibre of Brookes and
Patterson are low-markers in golf, and
Schlesinger is another. J. O. Ander-
son and Jim Willard are developing their
game rapidly. Most of our tennis visitors
have been golfers of sorts, while the
Japanese Harada was a very good one.
(<Continued on page 26.)
Car and Cycle
“Formula”: Engine revs, are a sealed
book to the average motorist, who, never-
theless, would often like to know how
many times his engine is turning over at
set speeds. There is an easy method of
finding this out. Get the gear ratio and
the diameter of the driving wheel, this in-
cluding the tyre also —every driver of
a car should have these fixed in his nut.
Then multiply the speed as shown in
m.p.h. by the rear axle ratio, and then by
336.164. Divide the sum by the diameter
of the driving-wheel in inches, and you
get your revolutions. If the speedometer
says 60 m.p.h. and the gear ratio is 4 to
1, with a 30-inch diameter driving-wheel,
your engine is turning over 2689 times in
the minute.
* * * *
“Bead Rim”: The effect of speed on
tyres is little appreciated by the average
motorist, and some experiments con-
ducted by a leading tyre-making firm
are of interest in this connection. One
set of tyres lasted 12,000 miles on a car
averaging 35 m.p.h. Another set of the
same quality was sent out on a car
kept up to 50 m.p.h., and was done at
the end of 6000 miles, the running con-
ditions being the same in each case, apart
from the speed. The additional 15 m.p.h.
was found to double the rate of tyre
wear, and the increase in wear with the
extra 10 miles, from 40 to 50 m.p.h., was
much greater than that resulting when
the speed was raised from 20 to 30 m.p.h.
* * * *
“Ball Race”: Hubert Opperman is off
to Britain in January and will train there
for an attempt on the Land’s End to
John o’ Groats pushbike record in June.
With him will go promoter Frank Small,
who will try to arrange with the Tour
de France authorities for the entry of
an Australian team in the big event next
year.

Henley-on-Yarra regatta on Saturday
saw Richmond (Vic.) win the Grand
Challenge event for the eights, the
Founder’s Challenge Cup and the
Maiden eights. H. J. Turner, of N.S.W.,
retained the Challenge Sculls after a good
race with his fellow Welshman W. J.
Tipping.

The Rugby League Kangaroos had two
more wins last week. One was a night
match at the White City, London’s lead-
ing tin-hare arena, and was against Wigan
Highfield; 20-5. The second match,
against Broughton Rangers at Man-
chester, went to the tourists by 19 to nil.

“Fitzcray”: The Victorian athletic
authorities have invited their opposite
numbers in Britain and the U.S.A. to
send along teams of athletes for the big
centenary meeting in Melbourne which
begins on January 26. Maoriland will
forward a contingent to join Australia
in opposition to the visitors. The U.S.A.
has been specially asked to ship Metcalfe,
the negro Olympic sprint champion, and
Spitz, holder of the world’s high-jump
record with 6ft. B|in.
* * * *
“Bamboo”: The Australian Polo Coun-
cil has given the Victorian controllers or
the game permission to hold an Inter-
State tourney in Melbourne next year as
part of the centenary jamboree. Teams
from all the States and from Maoriland
will be invited and the Victorians intend
to find some of the cost.

ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week's salary, it won t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one weeks
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.

Ins and Outs
The first of the Australian XI trial
matches, played in Melbourne, provided
uninteresting cricket for the most part.
Bright spots were Bradman’s 55 and 101 ;
118 by WoOdfull; an attractive 60 by
the Victorian ’keeper Barnett, who looks
a good pick for the second Aunt-Sally job
in England, and Ebeling’s 5 for 72 against
Woodful’s side, including Ponsford,
McCabe, Darling and Oldfield. Though
rain shortened the match, the benefi-
ciaries, Ironmonger and Blackie, are ex-
pected to pouch between £9OO and £lOOO
apiece.
* * * *
The Board of Control has mapped out
an itinerary for its selectors which should
keep those experts on the wing for the
greater part of the season. One at least
will attend every big match between
Adelaide and Brisbane, and the side will
be picked during the last Sheffield game,
that between N.S.W. and Victoria, which
begins in Sydney on January 26. The
board has consented to 16 men going
instead of 15 ; that is if any go at all,
after the latest foolish cablegram.

“Cash Amateur”: Sydney Cricket
Ground trustees tabled their annual
report in Parliament last week. The
balance sheet shows a working surplus
of £6786. Income was £25,358, £15,785
of which came from members’ subscrip-
tions. Balance was made up from cricket,
football and various sports, in addi-
tion to bar profits and interest on invest-
ments. No mention is made of the
rumor that the ground, granted for ama-
teur sport, is likely to be leased again to
the professional Rugby League, to the
exclusion of everyone else, as was done
for a long period some years ago.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Some of these wiseacres
who write cricket for the bellow press
give me a headache. Commenting on a
good bowling performance by the Vic-
torian Ebelin£ in the Melbourne trial
match, one of them pointed out that
Ebeling’s type of bowling had been less
successful overseas than that of the left-
handers and slow men. Ebeling is a fast-
medium right-hander. I can recall
several bowlers of this type who have
been quite successful in England, the
expert’s opinion to the contrary. The
names of Spofforth, Turner and Bill
Howell come to mind first. There are
others, but that should be enough.

“Bung Rules”: Supposing the Austra-
lian Eleven does get away to Eng-
land, followers of cricket and near
cricket will still have something to amuse
them outside the dog-racing and the
circus. This will be the All-Australia
gathering of women cricketers in Sydney
from February 17-24, when the N.S.W.
cricketinas will be at-home to the girls
from Queensland, South Australia
and Victoria. Maoriland has also been
invited, but is at present as dumb as a
toheroa on the subject.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Serotse”: Here’s something for Aus-
tralian experts on the rules of golf to
chew over. A player on the Kuraman
course in Bechuanaland drove a ball into
a herd of Kaffir goats, one of which
promptly swallowed it. The club com-
mittee is hopelessly divided as to the
penalty, if any, incurred by the player.
I think myself that Rule 17, Sub. 2, which
provides for a ball lodged in “anything
moving,” would apply. There is no doubt
about the goat moving, for the owner of
the ball, a Scotsman, chased it half-way
to Mafeking before consenting to cut his
loss.
* * * *
“Longbow”: As to queer golf happen-
ings (B. 22/11 /’33) here is one from
America, the place which produced
George Washington. One Bill Con-
nolly took a wipe at his ball. It hit
a tree in front of him and came buzzing
back like an infuriated hornet. In des-
peration Connolly made a wild swipe at
it in the air and sent it 150 yards down
the fairway on to the green. The story
ends there, but the player could have
done no good by his feat, since the
penalty for playing a moving ball is the
loss of the hole.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: Queensland’s Armistice
Cup finish provided a problem, no fewer
than four players tying for first place.
In the first play-off, Denholm and
Lupton cut out Stafford and Christo-
pherson respectively. They then took
each other on in a second play-off and
tied once more. In the third play-off
a decision was reached, Denholm coming
out on top with a score of 77 from
scratch, his opponent’s card showing a
net 81.
* * * V
“Mac”: The record of having done an
entire golf course in one (B. 15/11/’33)
has been equalled. R. Cockburn, of the
Port Augusta (S.A.) club, pulled his ball,
which struck the associates’ No. 1 tee-
box. It rebounded with sufficient force
to hop over the edge of the bunker
guarding the rear of the ninth hole (this
is a nine-hole course), and finished in
the pot.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: Victoria’s profes-
sional golf championship was won by
Bert Ferguson, an assistant professional at
Myer’s, by 2 and 1 from H. Boorer. This
is young Ferguson’s first big win—he is
SECOND: “He’s standin’ up to it well.”
PUG : “Standin’ up? Blime, can’t yer see I’m ’OLDIN' ’im up?”
only 21. His opponent, a prominent Vic-
torian veteran, who is in charge at
Woodlands, took the title as long ago
as 1927.
Racquet and Bawl
“Kooyong”: Hopman is said to have
made history of a sort when he turned
out in the match between Victoria and
N.S.W. in Melbourne wearing shorts.
Truth to tell, Harry did not provide a
feast for those whom the Psalmist de-
scribes as delighting in the legs of man,
being on the skinny side, but old hunting
men were unanimous that he has a fine
leg for a topboot—the same size all the
way up. After all, shorts are not alto-
gether an innovation. In the writer’s youth
they were common on English courts in
the shape of knickerbockers confined at
the knee with elastic. Many of the leading
English players of the ’eighties wore
them, notably Lawford, and in a later
day in Australia H. M. Rice and Percy
Colquhoun, of N.S.W. —the latter a fam-
ous Rugby player —invariably sported
them.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: We are all keen on
getting a team from Britain for the Mel-
bourne centenary celebrations. Peggy
Scriven and Mrs. Fearnley Whittingstall—
who looks absolutely ravishing in shorts,
my dear —are both keen on coming along,
and no doubt some of the other stars
will join in. Such a visit is well and truly
due. Australia has sent two official
women’s teams to Britain and Europe
since the war, and so far has not had the
visit returned.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: The committee
appointed by the International L.T.F. to
consider the question of payments to
amateurs has recommended that these be
confined to fares and expenses. That is
already the rule in other sports, and it
would be interesting to know why there
has been differentiation —if any—in
tennis. The committee opens the door,
also, to open tournaments with amateur
and professional players showing side
by side, suggesting that such meetings
be called “competitions” instead of
“matches.” Open tennis is bound to come
shortly, and it seems likely that the replies
by different countries to the proposals
which have been sent them will show an
affirmative majority when the I.T.F. con-
siders them in January.
Car and Cycle*
“Trek”: Round-Australia motor trips
have been out of the news lately, but one
was completed last week when three young
Victorians, Maloney, Boyes and Bennett,
cast up in Melbourne. They left it in
June and cruised up through N.S.W. to
Brisbane and thence up the east coast
to Cairns. Then across to Normanton
on the Gulf, and so to Darwin by Mt.
Isa and Camooweal. Buffalo-shooting
kept them in the N.T. for a while, and
thence they came down the west coast
to Geraldton, cutting across through Kal-
goorlie to Adelaide and so home. Extra
petrol-tanks and tyre-carxiers were the
only special fitments to their Buick car,
and a broken piston was the only
casualty.

“Whizz”: For some time past the in-
habitants of the Lake George (N.S.W.)
district have been vainly endeavoring to
persuade Malcolm Campbell that the
dried-up lakebed is the world’s finest
speedway. Campbell has not risen as ex-
pected to the fly, and Collector, the capi-
tal of the district, has now found out
why. It has been stung by serpents
nourished in its bosom, and stabbed in
the back by those it thought its dearest
friends, so to speak. In other words,
certain property owners of the neighbor-
hood, who have been objecting to the
countryside being turned upside down to
make a world’s record, have been writing
to Campbell informing him that the lake-
bed is a fraud and a delusion and up to
putty as a speedway. Collector is shaken
as to its faith in human nature, but still
determined to get Campbell if it bursts
in the attempt.

“Hotham”: The Australian tourist
trophy race for motor-cycles, which was
to have been held on the Bathurst
(N.S.W.) circuit next year, will probably
be staged in Victoria as part of the cen-
tenary jamboree. In that State it has, in
the past, been held on the Phillip Island
course, a genuine road circuit. It is now
suggested that, for gate reasons presum-
ably, it be held on a track round Albert
Park. If this is done, the race will not
deserve the “T.T.” label. That is re-
stricted by rule and custom to a road
course pure and simple, and a show at
Albert Park cannot come in that
category.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: Hitler has found at
least one force too strong for him—the
spirit of amateur sport. The American
Amateur Union recently demanded an
assurance from the International Olympic
Committee that, if the next Olympiad
was held at Berlin, the original decision
to exclude Jews would be cancelled. An
Olympiad without the Yanks would be
like the Macquarie-street stadium with-
out the genial influence of Lang. Recog-
nising that, Fritz has buried the swastika
for the time being at least and promised
to give the Yids a clean spin—should
any of them care to enter.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Sydney Full Court had
to hear an unusual application the other
day. Mark Morton, the Wallaby for-
ward, applied to have the time spent on
the tour of South Africa included as part
of that to be served under his articles of
law clerkship. Affidavits made much of
the fact that a tour of the sort helped
a budding solicitor to gain a knowledge
of men and things that later would be
an asset in his profession. The slightly
amused Bench agreed, Harvey, C.J., re-
marking that he and his offsiders would
consider the absence in the same light as
active service at the front.
* * * *
“Splash”: The present-day craze for
winning athletic championships at all
costs was unpleasantly illustrated a few
days ago when Queensland announced
that Mailo Kalili, the Hawaiian swimmer,
would represent the State in the coming
Australian championships. Kalili will
have fulfilled the six months’ residential
qualification by the time the champion-
ships come off in January, but he is a
citizen of the U.S.A. and intends to
return there. It has been necessary to
have his permit to remain in Australia
specially extended to permit his staying
until after the national meeting. There
can be no personal objection to Kalili,
who is as fine a sportsman as he is an
athlete, but he is a bird of passage, and
that Queensland should drag him in by
the ears because he is a record-holder
and sure to score points for the State is
a negation of all true sportsmanship.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 15.
Men of Melbourne's Metropolitan.
Metropolitan is now a generation old
as a playing combination, for its course
at Oakleigh was opened in 1908. Among
the foundation members were R. C.
Meares, Dr. Barclay Thomson and
Robert Debenham.
There are few lovelier courses. From
the beginning a scheme of tree-planting
was carried out, and many of the plant-
ings were of the beautiful and unique
Westralian flowering-gum. The man
actually responsible for the plantation
layout was Boyne-Luffnan. From the
golfing point of view the course is also
in the first class. The centenary golf
championships are to be played over it,
which should be recommendation enough.
Metropolitan began life under the style
of the Australian G. C. It was later dis-
covered that an institution of the same
name existed in a place called Sydney,
and, as might be expected of true Mel-
burnians, the name was hurriedly
changed. To-day there are slightly over
1000 members, more elaborately classi-
fied than is the custom in most golf clubs.
Full members number 250, while there
are 270 associates. Then come 100
classed as provisional, 100 country, 20
junior and 23 “clerical.” This last is an
unusual rating, but our correspondent at
the front has left it at that and so must
we.
That the first man immortalised in the
above drawing is a golfer of the old
school may be guessed from the fact that
he scorns the meretricious adornment of
plus fours and a Jacob’s coat pullover
and plays like the men of old in ordinary
breeks and a stiff collar. He is W. H.
Swanton, president of the club and man-
aging director of W. Crosby and Co.; a
sound player off his 15 mark.
The contemplative man following his
president is J. M. Joshua, managing direc-
,or ° £ Br ™t and Mays. His handi-
ca P Is t 24 ' and he . ls ” oted , fo , r . aver-

there is always a danger of setting the

MacDougall, whose delineation by
Frith gives the impression that .he has
just received the bill for holing in one,
was president of the Melbourne Cham-
ber of Commerce for years. Being a
Scot, he can be no mug at golf, though his
handicap is a dark secret as far as The
Bulletin knows. The urbane lad who
succeeds is A. E. Boyes, a Melbourne
merchant. His full swing and his draught-
board plus fours incline to the thought
that the handicapper has dealt gently
with him at 14. He of the Martha-like
cast of countenance—“the furrowed
brow and the troubled heart”—is Leslie
Jenner.
Erect and looking the whole world
in the face is Norman Bull, the
club captain and a former short-mark
pennant star. As it is to-day he is no
further up the line than 5. Dr. Barclay
Thomson is one of the club’s oldest in-
habitants and is no duffer as a player
either, as his 12 handicap indicates. His
heart is wrapped up in the plantation
work.
H. C. Winnecke Judge of the Vic-
torian County Court, follows, complete
with panama hat and insinuating smile.
He is on the 18 mark, but a keen fol-
lower of the game. Laughing at barbers
comes D. M. Taylor, better known as
“genial Dan.” He is a dangerous oppo-
nent off 16 and is confident he has the
winner of the next Victorian Leger in
his string. Walter Jones, sizing up the
situation through his glasses, is another
useful starter off a longish mark —18 in
his case. He is an accountant. After
W.J;, with the “Show ma; Ah coom fr’
Sheffield” expression is H. I. (“Mick”)
Graham. He is one of the heads of the
V.C.A. and an authority on the rules of
golf. A good player also off 10.
A. M. Oliphant, getting the most out
of his last gasper, was one of the shining
lights in Westralian golf some years ago.
In Melbourne he is managing director
of D. and W. Murray. C. M. Shaw has
been secretary of Metropolitan since
1923. A persistent golf addict, he has
also been convicted of founding the
Goulburn (N.S.W.) club in 1928. He
is a retired bank manager, and his golf
is played off the 24 mark. R. C. Meares,
whose forthright stride suggests deter-
mination, has plenty of that. One of the
club’s founders and an ex-president, he
boasts a 14 handicap. A solicitor by
profession.
Next comes T. H. Russell, a former
bank manager, who probably acquired
that “Oh, yeah! ” expression through list-
ening to requests for overdrafts. He
is a noted foursomes player with an
8 handicap.
L. J. Watson, he of the bird-like profile
addressing the ball, is a hard man to
better off the 12 mark. He is an account-
ant away from golf. D. D. Bryant,
the pleasant chap with the coiffure re-
sembling that of Mt. Buffalo in winter,
holds down a 13 handicap; daughter
Betty Bryant is a member of the asso-
ciates’ committee. H. R. F. Chomley is
a solicitor, and when he plays golf his
handicap is 15.
Next to chomley is W. J. P. Davies, a
re fired merchant. He is a devoted fol-
]ower Q f g Q ]f ? anc j has done much work
j n t h e past f or t h e g ame , though the pat-

former champion of the club. A son of
“Mick” beforementioned he is a 1-
marker, and a bright lad who will play
better golf before he finishes. C. H.
Peebles is connected with Australian
Estates in the mere matter of business,
In golf he is a first-class foursomes player
with an 18 handicap,
Bravely facing the worm which dieth

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE CHAIN SYSTEM.
“A.J.8.”: “Lion” (B. 8/11/ ’33) has had
no experience as a butcher, or he would
not recommend the chain system for
N.S.W. It is not nearly as fast as the
“solo” method—6o per man per day is the
maximum so far—and carcasses never
will be as well dressed as by the old way.
A carcass must be well “legged’ as a first
requisite to being well dressed, and that
is hardly possible while they are sus-
pended on a hook and mornig. A hard
stationary surface is necessary for the
first operation.
Secondly, to have a well-taken off
skin the carcass must be flanked out on
the ground —this obviates the use of the
knife on the flanks and prevents scor-
ing. As one who remembers the won-
derful tallies and quality of workmanship,
under the old system, of Hall, Curran
and Osborne (N.S.W.), who could have
been backed against the world for £lOOO,
Power and Jackson (Q.), Craddock,
Minns, McFarlane and McDonagh (Vic.),
and Verity (S.A.), I lament that tradesmen
have been reduced to the position of
glorified laborers.
HAND-FEEDING.
“Sheepo”: “Wandi” (B. 11/10/’33)
has had little experience in artificial feed-
ing of weak sheep if he suggests feeding
them close to water. I tried it only once,
and still remember the troubles caused
by impaction. Even though the paddock
had a certain amount of roughage, the
sheep would not leave the vicinity of the
water, and therefore got no exercise,
which is necessary for artificially-fed
sheep. Make the sheep travel to water.
Feed them at least a mile away. Don’t
place the lick near the water either. If
you do the sheep will try to keep alive
on lick and water only.
BALE WEIGHTS.
“Wool Hawk”: Complaints have been
made by woolbrokers in Queensland that
the average weight of wool going through
their hands has shown a shrinkage of
71b. a bale compared with last season’s
weights. The lighter bale weight does
not indicate a falling off in the clip, as
some profess to believe. There is a ten-
dency to make bales lighter, and the
weights vary. To find out whether there
is a clip shortage the weight of wool per
sheep should be estimated. In 1930-31
the average bale weight of greasy was
3251 b. and 377,760 bales were offered.
The following year the figures were
3271 b. and 427,273. For 1931-32 the aver-
age bale weighed 3221 b. and the number
of bales was 408,533. Last season’s
figures showed 3251 b. per bale, and
436,392 bales were put up. In effect,
though bale weight varied slightly, weight
of wool and number of bales maintained
a steady average, this, 324f1b. and 412,489
respectively, indicating there has been no
falling off in the clip worth considering.
This average is expected to be kept up
during the current season.
IMPROVED PASTURES AND
ROUGHAGE.
“Hatter”: Some'farmers complain that
improved pastures lead to an increase
of disease in stock ; and so they do when,
owing to lack of knowledge of food
values, animals do not get the chance
to balance nutritious feed with roughage.
Bloating usually occurs when hungry
cows are turned into a clover paddock.
Clover, a badly balanced ration, impairs
the digestive system and renders the ani-
mal susceptible to bloating. Clover hay,
fed at the morning milking, is of no
advantage. Where about 101 b. of
Algerian hay-chaff is fed per head, bloat-
ing seldom develops. The milk yield is
considerably increased, as the rich clover
is properly balanced with the chaff.
Pulpy-kidney disease of lambs is due
to overfeeding on rich young pastures
with a high protein content. Let lambs
have access to some rough grazing,
where they will turn readily to rushes,
coarse weeds or hedges. An animal
balances its own ration when given the
opportunity. Little pigs require to “root”
in clean soil and to eat enough of it
to supply their need of iron. When shut
up in styes they frequently develop
anaemia. Although this may be con-
trolled by dosing with ferrous sulphate,
it is hardly a practicable measure on a
commercial scale. If they cannot get a
run-out, give them a box of clean earth.
BEATING THE BLOWFLY.
“Jumbuck”: Every grazier can reduce
blowfly attacks if he takes proper pre-
cautions. Paste these rules in your hat:
(1) Destroy all carcasses by burning thoroughly
and spraying the residue with an arsenical solu-
tion. ...
(2) Cull out all wrinkly-breeched sheep so
as to graze plain-bodied sheep less liable to
blowfly strike.
(3) Crutch, jet or spray as soon as the blow-
flies get bad, and use a hospital paddock tor
holding and treating struck sheep.
(4) Place blowfly traps about the yards,
watering-places and shady resting-places.
(5) Rake up and burn any matter liable to
act as breeding-grounds for the flies about the
yards and watering-places; throw quicklime over
the rails and ground where lambs have- been
marked.
These measures won’t make sheep safe
from attack, but the increase of the flies
will be checked, and struck sheep pro-
perly attended to will be less prone to a
fresh attack.
SAFE CALVING.
“Gland”: Modern veterinary science
is dead against the advice given by “The
Lad” (B. 15 /11 / ’33) in cases where the
afterbirth has been retained. Bacterial
action causes the release of the cotyle-
dons, or “buttons,” and fluids will in no
way assist this action to take place. On
the contrary. Do not introduce fluid into
the womb till the sixth day, though there
are many forms of dry disinfectants
which can be used in safety. But drench-
ing is good practice.
If more drenching were done before
calving, there would be less need
for it after, less trouble in calving, fewer
retained afterbirths and less milk fever
—and less work for the vets. The syring-
ing solution advocated by “The Lad” is
costly—pot. iodide costs about 3s. 6d.
per ounce, and the amount needed to
make up two gallons of fluid would be
well beyond the reach of most men’s
pockets.
SILVER BEET AS A GREEN
FODDER.
“Silen”: Silver beet (silver spinach or
seakale) is grown for the tops. This
crop was for many years regarded as a
vegetable only, but recent experiments
have proved that it will be a future
main green fodder plant for farms. Its
appeal is that it can be sown and will
grow the whole year, while throughout
the winter it provides more succulent
green feed than most crops. There are
two main types. Lucullus is the best
fodder plant, while the Broadrib is best
for table or for pigs. The seed is like
ordinary red beet, but germinates better.
If at all dry, soak it for a few hours in
warm water to soften the cork or outer
shell.
For small areas the seed is best sown
in boxes, but for pasture in drills about
30 inches apart. A good plan is to
leave every third drill empty and move
the surplus seedlings into it, the plants
being thinned out to 10 inches apart.
For dairy cattle or pigs the leaves should
be pulled—never cut —and fed whole or
chaffed, while for poultry it is the best
green introduced, there being no waste
whatever ; all is soft and edible.
For sheep, the crop should be grazed
down to its tops, then spelled, when the
whole root will throw out a dense mass
of foliage, this growth continuing for
almost two years if the crop is well
managed. For gummies, lambs or sheep
low in condition it stands alone and is
a great wool-improver. Owing to the fact
that the growth contains a great per-
centage of the best mineral salts and
iron, its use lowers the need and cost of
rock salt or licks, and improves the
general health of animals.
Maoriland sheep-farmers are using
silver beet extensively. Seed runs
into 3s. 6d. or 4s. a pound and three
pounds is ample per acre. Home seed
is easily harvested from good samples.
The root after a season is as big as a
mangold, and can be sliced or fed whole
to the grunters. Pigs should not be
grazed bn the crop, as they go for the
roots first and spoil aftergrowth.
QUALITY IN POTATOES.
“Agrarian”: Parts of the earth; are
noted for fertility, like the Golden Vales
of Hereford in England, and Tipperary
in Ireland. The cause of it in those val-
leys is that the calcareous rock which
abounds weathers in just such degree
that the soil is perpetually mellowed.
Shortly before he died Donald Mc-
Donald of Melb. “Argus” started a lively
controversy re “The Lost Potato.” He
deplored the absence from hotel and cafe
of the floury potato of his earlier days.
Correspondents from strong red soils of
Daylesford districts said that they could
still supply him. Now the president of
the Growers’ Association, G. Bur-
hop, tells us that, by following Vic.
Agric. Dept, advice to fertilise with am-
monia-super. mixtures, they grow heavy
yields, but the spuds will not keep. The
tubers look well when freshly dug, and
sometimes rot before they leave the local
railway station.
Years ago, from the same soil, pota-
toes carried to almost all parts of the
Commonwealth. Now it is only those
grown on new ground or manured with
stable manure that will keep. G. Seymour
(28/10/ ’33) says he resigned from Vic.
Agric. Dept, because he was not sup-
ported in his wish to do research
into the problems of the worn-out lands.
He did not question manurial practice
re the strong clay loams, and suggested
that the trouble came from peaty areas,
urging the use of lOcwt. to 15cwt. of
lime per acre for such soils. I have
often wondered if there was a catch
somewhere in the theory that potatoes
do not need lime.
We have come to know that it is not
enough to have bulk in pasture. “All
flesh is grass,” and varies accordingly.
Apart from its .not keeping long enough
to be marketed, we may well ask if the
potato, even though cooked in its jacket,
varies in its quality as food.
POISONING TIMBER.
“Deeabree”: Re “Wrash” on poison-
ing trees (B. 8/11 /’33). Arsenic poison-
ing is right enough on high-grade coun-
try,, but on four-acre-and-upwards western
(N.S.W.) grazing land it comes expensive.
Fifteen years’ experience on the red,
ridgy, seedy West Bogan has shown me
that many men ringbark a lot of timber
when it’s too young. The older the tree
the surer the kill. Ring, by taking a
strip of bark 6in. wide from round your
tree, all trees Bin. and over in diameter,
and grub out all seedlings up to 2yin.
diameter.
You are then definitely rid of all the
young stuff, and will probably find a
60 p.c. kill in the rung timber. The
remaining 40 p.c. should not need more
than two suckerings for the worst of it.
While suckering ring anything that has
attained Bin., and grub out young seed-
lings. I have always found that West
Bogan box and gum are not yet well edu-
cated enough to tell the seasons, and
after every good rain they think it spring.
So there is no special time to ring.
IN THE ORCHARD.
“John A. Thunn”: Practise orchard
hygiene now. Lures in the trees help to
eradicate the codlin moth and give, when
properly established, a good indication
as to when the moth is flying, which in
turn tells you when to spray.
White flowerpots, with the bottom
hole plugged, are suitable receptacles for
the lure, usually molasses or apple-juice,
with a drop of oil of Geraniol to attract
the moths. Bands of corrugated paper
impregnated with B-Napthol and oil,
attached around tree stems, help to con-
trol the pest. Apply them at once. Or
make the bands of hessian. Soak them in
a 10 p.c. napthalene solution. Napthalene
is soluble in methylated spirit or coal
tar —the latter making a good dressing
for the hessian.
Lead arsenate is not the perfect insec-
ticide for orchards, but it is the best
available. The usual strength of spray in
Vic. is one pound of arsenate to 30
gallons of soft water. Add l|lb. of white
oil emulsion. Spreaders are needed in
cases of dual-purpose spraying, e.g., lime
sulphur plus lead arsenate.
If you purchase lead arsenate, first
obtain small samples of all brands. Test
them by placing a teaspoonful of each
in pint fruit-jars half-filled with water.
Shake each jar vigorously for two
minutes. Then fill it with water and let
it stand. Do the test quickly, and make
due allowance for time lost between
shaking the first and last jars. All things
being equal, buy the arsenate which
shows the best suspension.
If you must use a spreader, use pow-
dered skim milk, cane sugar or calcium
caseinate (a mixture of four parts
slaked lime and one part commercial
casein). The muddier the water used
in diluting, the better the result. When
using the combined lead arsenate-lime
sulphur spray without a spreader add
slaked lime (lib. to every pound of
arsenate). To make the spray add the
materials to the tank in this order:
Water, lime sulphur, lime or spreader,
lead arsenate.
ARSENIC SPRAY.
“Tanya-Tyga”: Correspondent 7716
(B. 6/9/’33) need not be scared of poi-
soning with arsenically sprayed fruit.
The quantity left on the fruit, experts
say, is so infinitesimal that one would
have to eat a ton to feel any ill' effects.
I have dosed pigs freely with Fowler’s
Solution, which is made by boiling to-
gether lib. of arsenic and lib. of caustic
soda. I started with two drops and
gradually increased to 15, but no ill
effects resulted. The physic has a most
beneficial effect on growing slips and
fattening stores. Pigs will fatten quickly
under this tonic treatment. It makes the
coats of fattening pigs shine. But, be-
cause it does good, don’t conclude that
a larger dose is going to do much more
good. Use it often and in small quanti-
ties. ■ *
SILVER-FOX FARMS.
“Gumblegubbin”: In England and
Scotland 250' farmers are engaged in
silver-fox breeding, introduced from
Canada 13 years ago. British pelts are
selling at £l5 to £3O each. Last year
sales exceeded £1,000,000. These foxes
might thrive in southern parts of Aus-
tralia as the common fox has done, with-
out becoming pestilent bushrangers—in
the Monaro, for instance. Country
around Kosciusko and Kiandra is use-
less for grazing ; thousands of acres are
practically waste, and might be put to
good use in fur production. Some time
ago it was proposed to farm the common
fox, but the high-priced silver species
would be more payable. Only small en-
closures would be needed. The ’possum
is already being farmed in Queensland.
OVERHEATED HORSES.
“The Breaker”: In hot weather horses
become overheated and collapse. In mild
cases apply very cold water to the head
and down the spine ; if possible, apply it
with pressure. Give heart stimulants to
prevent paralysis and to keep the heart
pumping; two ounces of aromatic
spirits of ammonia in a pint of water
will serve as a drench. Prevent the horse
struggling to get up; it will recover
more quickly lying on the ground, pro-
vided it is under shade. Bleed in acute
cases.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Bill R.”: If a horse paws at the
manger and works holes in the stable
floor buckle a hobble-chain to his fore
fetlock. The chain will rap his other
shin. This will cure him.
“Eureka”: Do not waste time in fine
weather doing odd jobs that can be left
for a rainy day. Harness repairs, over-
hauling machinery, fitting new axe
handles, repairing feed-bins, mending
farm utensils, shelling and cracking corn,
sharpening knives and axes, greasing
drays and ploughs and mending cow
rugs and horse rugs are all suitable wet-
weather jobs.
“Bush Medico”: Although iodine is
regarded as the best treatment for
wounds, human and stock, peroxide of
hydrogen is cheaper and good. It
quickly cleans out the wound, and is far
less painful. For nervous or badly-cut
stock it simplifies treatment. Use a
rubber cork for the bottle, and see that
it is kept stoppered. Small bottles used
pure are best.
“Gardener”: If grass and rubbish,
generally burnt, were placed round
growths, both large and small, they would
keep the soil moist and cool during the
summer months. In the autumn the
mulch is dug in and provides humus and
manure, lowering the cost of other fer-
tilisers. Many failures result from sun-
burn of the roots ; the whole soil face
should be covered.
“Hatter”: When poisoning trees with
arsenic dissolved with soda (B. 8/11/’33)
keep all stock off the poisoned area for
at least a month. Cut off saplings and
suckers low down and dab on the solu-
tion described by “Wrash” with a swab-
stick.
“Eureka”: Get rid of old cows
promptly. A cow which gives half a
gallon of milk a day eats as much grass
as a cow that gives two or three times
as much milk.
QUESTION ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department .)
Will the Australian saltbush grow in Maori-
land ? The soil is clay and sandstone, and
grows only manuka scrub. —8632.
Many species of Australian saltbush are
valuable forage plants in salty, arid country.
Some would, no doubt, grow in Maoriland, but
it is unlikely that they would be able to com-
pete, for forage purposes, with many kinds of
grasses on the country described, where there
is an annual precipitation of about 40 inches
of rain. Seeds of all the more useful species
of saltbush may be obtained from any of the
leading seedsmen in Australia., *’

tion of citronella oil are Cymbopogon nardus,
C. citratus and C. martinii. None of these is
grown in Australia. It is- quite likely that, if
kept well watered during the summer, they
would thrive at Inverell.

“FINEST
AUSTRALIAN NOVEL
SINCE ‘PAGEANT’ ”
“THE DOUGHMAN”
By ROBERT DESMOND TATE
ON SALE at the end of this month. After reading “THE
DOUGHMAN,” one of Australia’s leading literary critics wrote
as follows:
‘‘Why has the life with which this
novel deals been passed over by
Australian writers? It is more than
an author’s brilliant first novel; it
is the first of its kind among our
novelists. It translates, in terms of
the sharpest realism, an aspect of
life in the raw —in the sweat and
wnßawm
I
steam, the stealth and sinister deal-
ings that may form the atmosphere
of industrial workers. It shows the
insidious effect such atmosphere
may have on those who breathe it—
men and girls. It shows the re-
action of a girl of clean character
and a man who, in other circum-
stances, might have been an inspira-
tion to men. As setting for t'he vivid
rapid-action drama of these and the
rest of his oddly-assorted group,
the author has introduced a bake-
house, of the days before stringent
supervision by authority, when
night-baking held men to the glare
of the fires, providing their part of
a city with its daily loaf.
A hellish setting, appropriate to
such a queer figure as the leading
character, the Doughman. The
figures come to life in their setting,
playing their parts in this realistic
drama, which, for all the relentless-
ness of its realism, carries with it a
quick spice of humor and the soften-
ing influence of romance.”

City.
The Wool Market
“Anthony”: In years gone by, when
London was a more dominating influ-
ence, there was always a local hush of
anticipation when the then world’s big-
gest wool-selling centre was about to
open. Early cable results were waited
for with feverish anxiety. But London
opened last Tuesday with 120,000 bales
with hardly a flutter of reaction in local
centres. Sydney’s advance of 5 p.c. on
the day before London at one time
would have been regarded as almost a
sacrilege: to-day it is pursued with non-
chalant indifference to old precepts, with
just perhaps a curiosity to see if London
would come into line.
* * #
On this occasion, without doubt, Lon-
don did come into line. Nearly every
feature established in local markets has
its confirmation in London. Rises of
from 10 p.c. to 25 p.c. above rates cur-
rent at the close of last series have been
reported. Faulty Continental sorts have
shown the least improvement, and good,
fine crossbreds have shown the most.
* * * *
There is just the hint of a warning
in the latter movement. Comebacks and
fine crossbreds are the next best thing
to merino ; and, when they are being
sought so eagerly, it is often a sign that
merinos have climbed a bit too high for
many users.
* * * *
All markets operating in Australia
continue firm. A general upward ten-
dency is observable, and Yorkshire, aided
by protection of the home trade and
shrewd trade agreements .with some
of the northern European countries, is
getting the lion’s share of the offerings,
but the Continent is doing well, and
Japan is trying hard without its usual
luck. Local mills, particularly in Vic-
toria, are also taking good quantities.
* * * He
Trade in wool manufactures is good
everywhere, but there is a big deficiency
in the quantity of the raw wool needed
to see millmen through their require-
ments. The shortage is anything from
750,000 to 1,000,000 bales. Australia on
revised figures will be 400,000 bales short,
and this with lighter bales. M.L. is
35,000 bales short, and South Africa is
225,000 behind it. Also, thanks mainly
to woolgrowers meeting the market in
less prosperous times, there has been a
very much smaller carryover to this
season from last than has been the case.
* * * *
In Sydney last week 50,615 bales were
offered publicly, but, including private
sales, 52,252 bales were sold at an aver-
age of 15.9 d. per pound, or £2O 3s. lOd.
per bale. The character of the offering
was a little disappointing, but still good.
The price remains at about appraisement
levels. Anything much higher would be
a bit unsafe.
Price Per Head
“Jumbuck”: Prices obtained for top-
fleece lines on paper might give growers
reason to congratulate one another, but
it’s the return per head that counts.
Weight of fleece and price per pound
cannot both be obtained to the maximum,
but there’s nothing like a happy medium.
Light cutters that grow wool above the
average are all right for fancy prices, and
for certain districts, but they don’t fill
the wool bales. Weight of fleece can be
obtained without reverting to the wrinkly
types ; and by selective breeding methods
plain-bodied sheep can be produced that
will cut good payable wool in right
quantity.
The Zone System
“Sheepo”: “Trepex” (B. 8 /11 / ’33) sug-
gests that the present method of offering
wool in Sydney under the “zone” system
does not go far enough, and implies that
the season should be divided into “ ‘time’
zones, embracing the separate arrivals
within each.”
Some growers would not rest if they
were not able to have their wool offered
just when they wished, and I fail to see
how the suggested alteration from the
geographical system to the time-of-arri-
val system will satisfy everybody.
The present system was planned to
include in the catalogues various types of
wool from the different districts. Varied
selection of wools is needed at every
sale, and the big clearances made regu-
larly under the “zone,” independent of
a high or low wool market, should prove
that the trade likes the way in which the
wools are offered.
“Trepex’s” suggested new system
would mean too much of sameness of
wools in succeeding catalogues.
Fat-lamb Production
“Sheepo”: In discussing the types of
rams to use with merino ewes for pro-
ducing ideal lambs for export, experts
have often referred to certain breeds
being the most suitable for crossing pur-
poses. One feature seems to be over-
looked in laying down breeding maxims
—all breeds are not adaptable for every
district. Climatic and pastoral condi-
tions must be the deciding influence. If
lambs cannot mature at the desired age
their worth as export lambs is greatly
reduced. Lamb-breeders should thor-
oughly investigate all avenues so as to
cultivate only those types which will con-
form to climatic and pastoral condi-
tions and reach maturity at the right age.
Once lambs reach the peak and start
to assume grown-sheep formation, the
quality of the meat is impaired. Use
only pure-bred rams, and nothing further
removed than first-cross ewes.
Butter Prices Slump
“8.5.”: After three stable weeks the
landslide in the London butter market
has recommenced. Demand is slow,
prices low. At the conclusion of the
week’s business Australian salted finest
had lost Bs. The quote at 78s. was on a
par with that ruling the third week of
January. Poor trading and heavy arrivals
are “bearing” prices.
* * * *
Peak production here and in M.L. is
responsible for the increasing size of
weekly shipments. During the second
week of this month Australia shipped
over 4000 tons to British ports ; so did
M.L. Thus the two Dominions provided
England with a week’s butter supply.
Excess imported butter, averaging about
3000 tons, was added to cold storage
holdings. At mid-month these stood at
14,000 tons and were normal. That
amount will grow rapidly.
* * * *
The weight of butter here and in M.L.,
most of which must be sent to J. Bull’s
market, is giving operators there more
concern than stocks, or even current
arrivals. They realise that Australia’s
production for some time will be heavy.
The same applies to M.L., where the
gradings early this month were 9320
boxes greater than at that time last year.
London cables forecast a further price
decline. It is probable that last year’s
record low price of 645. may be at least
equalled.
* * * *
Even if the new stabilising legislation
is passed in both Federal and State
Houses, dairy-farmers cannot expect high
prices. Import parity effectually blocks
that. Australian butter has a protective
duty of 6d. a pound against M.L. com-
petition. Even £56 a ton tariff will not
allow the Australian price to rise over
Is. 3d. a pound. On to-day’s London
spot quotation M.L. butter could be
landed in Sydney, duty-paid, at 1435. a
hundredweight. Our price, therefore,
cannot go beyond that figure, without
meeting M.L. competition.
* * * *
In view of the heavy production in
Australia, the big volume afloat —on
Nov. 18 it was nearly 1,200,000 boxes —-
and depressed prices in Britain the
A.D.P.E. Board again may try to ration
exports. This time last year it withheld
20 p.c. The idea was to relieve pres-
sure of London arrivals. As a means of
stabilising the overseas price it was a
washout. N.S.W. and Q. were then
nearing peak production. Vic. had
passed that period and was not inter-
ested. The same will apply now if the
board introduces rationing. This month
Vic. will have got away her heaviest
weekly shipments. N.S.W. and Q. will
be left to carry the baby. It is doubtful
whether the scheme has real merit.
Buyers are indifferent where the butter
is stored. They know the available quan-
tity and gauge values accordingly. The
only advantage rationing has is that stor-
age here is cheaper than in London.
Canned-fruit Export
“E.V.”: While fruit settlements languish
and mandarins are given away in the
streets occasionally, canned-fruit produc-
tion grows throughout the world. The
Australian export business is not payable,
vet 20 factories operate to deal with apri-
cots, pears and peaches—in N.S.W. there
is one run by the Government, beside
which there are four co-op. factories in
Vic. and S.A. and 15 proprietary ones
in various States.
* * * *
Governments have to stand behind all
these. Victoria has placed £730,000 be-
hind the co-operative concerns. Aus-
tralian public commitments involved in
establishing the canned-fruit business
total £2,100,000, of which the Common-
wealth has spent about £900,000.
f * * * *
With this aid, output has increased, but
increased erratically. In 1927 the total
production of canned apricots, pears and
peaches was 1,935,000 dozen tiris (300 z.).
Next year it was over 3,253,000 dozen.
Then it dwindled by 900,000 dozen,
climbed back to 3,570,000 dozen, halved
itself, grew by 600,000 dozen, and then,
in a single year, almost doubled. In
1932-33 it was 4,073,000 dozen tins!
* * * *
There used to be nothing wrong with
local consumption. In the peak year,
1929, Australians ate 2,000,000 dozen tins
—four cans per head of population. In
1932, however, the figure was down to
888,000 dozen, but improved European
demand has balanced this falling off to
some small extent. Britain last year
took 1,100,000 dozen tins, where in 1927
it took only 93,022 dozen. Exports to
Asia, too, have increased by nearly
70 p.c. in two years. These external re-
sults have been obtained in the face of
continued refusal to rectify faults which
could easily be mended—wrong-colored
syrups, bad interior tin surfaces, happy-
go-lucky disregard of proper grading.
Even at that, output in years like the last
shows hopeless overproduction.
* * * *
Of the record pack of 1932-33, 85 p.c.
was up to export quality, as it is under-
stood here, but not in other countries,
and it has had the help of Ottawa prefer-
ence, which, allowing for balancing
duties, is worth from about Is. to
Is. sd. per dozen tins. British market
conditions, however, have been un-
settled, and the result has been strong
local selling competition in Australia,
which, while it has caused prices to fall,
has done nothing to increase consumption
and eat up the huge supply available.
* * * *
As the 1933-34 season promises to be
heavy in yield, the outlook is far from
bright, and it looks as if a good deal of
the fruit grown will be left unprocessed.
* * * *
The canned-fruit industry badly needs
to be put on a stand-on-your-own-feet
basis. Export grading to rigid standards
equal to the best Californian ideals, better
labelling, more evenness of supply, would
do more in the end than all the bolster-
ing and stabilisation. As with some of
our other produce, factories must get rid
of their take-it-or-leave-it complex. The
world won’t buy what it doesn’t want.
It certainly won’t risk taking home tins
when it is never certain whether there
are eight pears or nine in them, and then
doesn’t know in any case what size the
fruit will be.
Tobacco Troubles
“Living in Hopes”: This season, out
of 33391 b. of tobacco, I have sold
only 15001 b., and there are a lot of
growers who didn’t sell any leaf at all.
My price for the 15001 b. averaged
about Is. Bd. per lb. The tobacco-
growers of the Mareeba (N.Q.) district
are leaving their farms, growing other
crops or drawing rations from the
Queensland Government.
three years ago this Mareeba
district was O.K.’d for tobacco-growing
by the Federal reps., and the buyers were
satisfied with the article we were pro-
during. Now comes the Commission’s
report, and the buyers’ attitude has been
reversed.
Bounty for Eggs
“A.C.”: N.S.W. Egg Board is making
history. Having tapped Commerce Minis-
ter Stewart for a bounty, it has now
asked Premier Stevens for a sub. towards
losses on export. Meanwhile it continues
to export. U.K. has already taken
14,750,000 dozen from Australia, or
2,000,000 more than it did last season.
* * * *
If Stevens is willing to contribute to
the board’s export losses, what is he
going to do for the feather squatter's who
have marketed their eggs outside the
board?
Empire Cheese
“H.J.8.”: Empire countries are the
largest caterers for J. Bull’s cheese appe-
tite. For the first eight months of this -
year they contributed nearly 2,000,000 cwt.
against 155,270 cwt. foreign. M.L. held
top place with 1,610,000 cwt. Canada
was second with 199,084 cwt. Australia’s
share was 75,736 cwt. That effort was
31,483 cwt. better than 1932. Foreign
supply came chiefly from the Nether-
lands, with 76,988 cwt., and Italy, with
58,000 cwt. Italy specialises in Gorgon-
zola and other untamed brands.
Chilled Beef
“Beefo”: “A.R.” (B. 8/11/’33) is quite
right when he states young steers suitable
for the chilled beef export trade must be
fattened close to the points of treatment.
Young fats lose most of their bloom
when travelled long distances.
No natural grasses in the world fatten
more quickly than the Mitchell and
Flinders, and in good seasons in n.-w.
Queensland quality steers get quickly
fat and solid ; but they’re too soft and
young to stand up to 600 miles on the
hoof.
Owners in those parts have to rely on
getting rid of their cattle as stores, and
by the time they walk into fattening
country they’re too old for baby beef.
We need railways to near-by ports
badly.
M.L. Produces More
“J.R.K.”: Dairy produce in M.L. is
exhibiting remarkable figures. For the
second month of the present season
receipts of butter into store show a
growth of 96,000 boxes. The quantity of
cheese graded that month—47B4 tons—is
just 33 p.c. higher than it was twelve
months ago. Despite such heavy produc-
tion —M.L. has no Paterson scheme to
inflate her local price—the butter market
for the second month stood at Is. Id. a
lb. for choicest prints.

“Erua”: Maoriland’s affection for the
half-crown (B. 23/11/’33) is easily ex-
plained. It is a nice, large, comfortable
sort of coin, particularly useful on
juvenile birthdays or for a charity offer-
ing. It makes up handily five shillings,
seven and six and fifteen shillings, all
sums much in commercial use, and it is
a coin from which change is seldom
needed; It is seldom that one hasn’t to
wait for change from a florin, as practi-
cally nothing costs two shillings, the
jump being from one and eleven to half
a crown net. Nothing is ever priced at
two and five.
* * * *
“Coif”: One of England’s most ancient
institutions is coming to an end this
year—the Grand Jury, summoned at the
commencement of each assize to deter-
mine whether a true bill should be filed
against the accused on the calendar. In
Australia this function is performed by
the Crown Law Office concerned, and
that will be the case in England for the
future. The Grand Jury, composed of
men of higher standing and property
qualification than the petit jury—yet not
to be confused with the special jury of
civil cases—dates from the reign of
Ethelred 11., when twelve senior thanes
were sworn that they would accuse no
innocent man. It was designed to safe-
guard the community against false
charges, but later statutory protections
have rendered it unnecessary.
* * * *
“Thormanby”: That reference to Lord
de Gray as a great game shot (B.
15/11 /’33) reminds me that he also had
the reputation of being a very jealous
one. In a book of reminiscences Winston
Churchill tells a story of shooting on the
next stand to the great man. The birds
were easy and Winston was more than
satisfied with the number that dropped
behind him. During a lull in this drive
he noticed that De Gray and an attendant,
with a spaniel, were walking about
behind him. When he and his loader
went later to pick up his birds—-he had
no dog and had to let them lie he found
a bare half-dozen where there should
have been thirty at least. De Gray, on
the other hand, had a tremendous bag
an d condescendingly accepted the usual
congratulations,
*.* * *
“Divot Digger”: Gene Sarazen, who
will be with us early in the new year, has
been telling the world about the money
that is or isn’t in golf, professional and
amateur. He considers his six tries to
win the British open cost him £4OOO, and
when he took the title at last the first
prize for professionals was only £lOO.
Even after the win and the subsequent
engagements this and the taking or the
American open soon after brought him,
he just balanced his accounts for the
year.. Gene is silent on the subject or
the big money which is on offer to Amen-
can professionals the year round from
Canada to Agua Cahente. In addition to
heavy cash prizes, the clubs have to pay
down fat appearance money to players
of the calibre of Sarazen and many of
his contemporaries.
“Pore du Chemin”: Britain is perturbed
over the rapidly increasing toll of motor
accidents involving pedestrians, the total
from the beginning of 1919 to the end
of October being over two millions. A
special effort is to be made to deal with
what the Americans call “repeaters” —
drivers responsible for more than one
accident. An American counting-up last
year showed that of the 5000 drivers in-
volved in car accidents 14 per cent, were
repeaters. The police throughout Britain
are now furnishing returns which, it is
hoped, will spot the habitual offenders
there. Permanent license cancellation is
suggested as the fitting way of dealing
with these gentry, some of whom harbor
in Australia.
* * * *
“Topping Lift”: After a long spell,
Britain is to have another try for the
America’s Cup. The challenger is
T. O. M. Sopwith, of the famous avia-
tion firm, and his craft will be a new
yacht named the Endeavour. The
Americans will, presumably, follow the
practice of other years and form syndi-
cates to build several defenders, the ulti-
mate representative selecting herself in
preliminary trial races. The big hurdle
for the challenger, the necessity under
the rules for crossing the Atlantic under
her own sail, still presents itself. Condi-
tions may be more favorable, for, by
general consent, the mechanical devices
for sail-hoisting which the Yankees
sprang on Thomas Lipton at the last
box-on are now forbidden.

Books on bodyline bowling have been
like the sands on the sea, and few of
them have not been tinctured with either
ignorance or prejudice. That cheerful
darky Constantine, who recalled to Aus-
tralians when he was here with the West
Indies a combination of the better aspects
of Jack Johnson and the effervescing
personality of the late Irving Sayles, has
written one that is worth reading, since
it tells the truth about the business. Con-
stantine frankly says that the main
object of fast bowling at the body is
intimidation of the batsman. No less a
panjandrum of cricket literature than
Neville Cardus has been converted by
the Jamaican’s book. He says that it
sends “flying the middle stump of cant
and humbug.”

“Kick Starter”: The British motor-
cycle is admittedly the world’s best. How
far designers have developed the snort-
ing contraptions may be seen from a
recent run of 500 miles in 500 minutes
on Brooklands track by a late Triumph
model. Heavy fog in the early part of
the day hung up the attempt, and up to
11 a.m. an average of only 56 m.p.h.
had been reached. Then the fog lifted,
and the average increased to 66 m.p.h.

“Cut Shot”: On the British official
ranking list Austin is placed second to
Perry. Then come Lee, Hughes and
Gregory —here with the last English
team some years ago, when he won
the Australian championship. Wilde, the
fourth man of the touring party in Aus-
tralia, fills sixth place. Dorothy Round
heads the women, with Peggy Scriven,
winner of the French women’s champion-
ship, second. Following her is the well-
advertised Betty Nuthall.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Queensland Chilled Meat
'‘CO2”: Queensland is waking up to
the fact that, to ensure success for the
chilled-meat trade with Europe which it
hopes to develop shortly, continuity of
supply is the first essential. Trial ship-
ments have proved that, properly pro-
cessed, the meat carries well. Successful
marketing is out of the question unless
deliveries follow on the heels of each
other, thus enabling distributors at the
other end to buy “forward” with
confidence.
So far, a voyage lasting 45 days has
been accepted as the average period for
the run to Europe, but the trade in
Queensland sees its way to cutting a lot
off that time. In the wool season many
ships make the run direct from east-coast
ports to Dunkirk in 31 days, with another
day to London, and, provided the right
shipping arrangements can be made, this
can be done as easily with meat as with
any other cargo.
C. W. D. Conacher says there will be no
trouble in getting ships properly fitted
for carrying chilled-meat cargoes. There
has been a rumor that, if Vesteys reopen
their NT. works, they intend to ship
the meat from Darwin, cutting out the
Queensland ports. Conacher says this is
moonshine. Even ships loading meat at
Darwin would need a lot of other cargo
to pay their way, and that could not be
got at Darwin. There has been a strong
move also to revive the old-time route to
Europe via Torres Strait and Singapore.
Contrary to the general idea, this is little
longer than the direct trip from the east
coast. In past years the 8.1. Co. carried
a lot of products by this route from
Brisbane arid other Queensland ports.
Courts and Abos.
“O. T. Line”: Some new system of
dealing with aboriginal crime in the
N.T. is needed. Judge Wells, a barrister
whose practice has been exclusively in
Sydney, and who can scarcely have seen
a wild abo. in his life, has been on the
Darwin Bench for some months dealing
with one native murder and assault cause
after another. In most of them every-
body except the police is a native from
a distant district. Mr. Wells has done his
job well, but that is not the fault of the
Administration which sent him here ; on
his experience, he might have turned
out incapable. As I write, he has be-
fore him Sambo Naynick-Kurra-Turra-
noa, charged with assaulting a prospector
on the Driffield goldfields, and shortly
will have to deal with another bunch of
Sambos charged with spearing a dingo
scalper on Mainoru. Scarcely a month
passes without some wretched nigger
being brought a few hundred miles to
answer a charge of battering his gin, and
many onlookers have a feeling that the
whole method is unsatisfactory. The
Interior Dept, might well take a leaf
out of the Mandated Territory and
Indian systems and divide the N.T. into
districts, each under a D.O. with magis-
terial powers. There should also be a
cadet system from which future D.Os.
could be recruited. The object of all
punitive measures against blacks should
be to discourage others from imitating
evildoers. Putting a lad in Fanny Bay
doesn’t discourage anybody a fortnight’s
trek away in the Gulf country. The cul-
prit is apt to be welcomed like a homing
Polar explorer when he returns to his
native heath.
That Brisbane Bridge
“Wickham Terrace”: Tell “Ann St.”
(B. 22/11 / ’33) that his whoop of joy at
the prospect of another bridge over the
Brisbane River from Petrie’s Bight to
Kangaroo Point has by no means been
echoed by all of his fellow-citizens. Two
parties have embarked on strong opposi-
tion to the scheme. One is the City
Council-cwm-shipping-companies bloc.
Nearly all the inter-State lines have their
wharves above the proposed bridge line.
The cos. say that the proposed clearance
of 120 ft. isn’t nearly enough, some of
the mastheads of their vessels running
up to 149 ft. at light load. The Adelaide
Co., which berths its vessels in the S.
Brisbane reach, has told the council,
which owns the wharves, that it may have
to cancel its leases. This is possible
under a clause whereby the council under-
took that no obstruction to navigation
would be permitted. As annual rentals
for the wharves above the proposed
bridge line last year totalled close on
£20,000, it can be seen that the council
has something to think about.
Another prominent lot in opposition
are those who say that the question of
flood-prevention, as urged in a recent
report by the Bureau of Industry, is of
greater importance to Queensland than a
bridge to benefit city interests only. The
non-Labor section of the council, headed
by Lord Mayor Greene, backs this view
strongly. The prevention scheme out-
lined by the bureau would find more
work than the bridge. Country objec-
tions are also loud. United Graziers
want to know whether it wouldn’t be
better for the State if the loan money
were spent on watering facilities along
the stock routes and on the matter of
stock transport generally. The Selectors
are also waving their tomahawk.
“G. 8.”: There is an occasional touch
of fun even in anthropology. A new-
chum scientist was studying a native of
New Guinea a few weeks ago. “Now,
my boy,” he asked, “do you think it
possible that some European blood may
run through your veins?” And the boy
replied, “Yes, marsta, me think poppa
belong me him-he kaikai plenty white-
pfeller-marsta.”
* * * *
“Marranboy”: While youngsters in the
south do their best to wriggle out of
doing duty on juries, our veterans of the
N.T. are not built that way. Bob Richard-
son, the discoverer of the Wandi goldfield,
“I don't fancy jam-tins somehow”
“Don’t be a goat! They make a clinking good feed.”
got a call the other day, and in reply to
Judge Wells’s doubtful questioning said
indignantly that he was not too old to
serve, being a mere 83. He also averred
firmly, in the face of distinct evidence to
the contrary, that he was not deaf, and
suggested that the Court should get on
with the business. The Judge excused
him, remarking that veterans of his age
should be left off the panel. The old
man went away very much annoyed.
* * * *
“Chiverton”: Having fairly got the
prickly-pear by the tail, Queensland is
finding that a pest almost as dangerous
is threatening. This is wild mint, which
is overrunning many properties on the
Darling Downs. The only treatment
found efficacious to date has been spray-
ing with arsenical compounds. On a
large scale this is too costly, while its
danger to stock is evident. The C.S.I.R.
is now striving to find a wog of some
kind with an insatiate appetite for wild
mint. But Cactoblastis and his kind do
not grow on every tree.
* * * *
“Vic”: Two residents of the Arrino dis-
trict (W.A.) will be careful in future how
they carry kerosene-tins. The boss of the
farm, needing a tin, sent his wife for it.
She put her finger in the bunghole and
carried it to him. Then he put his finger
in the bunghole and transferred it a few
yards further, dropping it rather rudely.
Then a large incensed snake put his head
through the bunghole from the inside,
and, though the subsequent proceedings
were not as entertaining as those which
took place when a young lady of the
seventies got a snake inside her crino-
lme in a Rockhampton street, they were
lively.
“X”: There is no doubt that these
North Queensland cities are progressive.
On top of a lengthy book issued by the
Cairns Tourist Association, the Cairns
Harbor Board has published a well-illus-
trated account of its port and the pass-
ages which give entrance to it. Cairns
has had a corporate Harbor Board since
1905. The port is approached by chan-
nels deep enough to take almost any ship
which comes to Australia and has 1900 ft.
of concrete wharves —1500 ft. in one piece
—sheds with floor space of 90,000 sq. ft.,
modern cranes of types in use at Euro-
pean ports. The net income of the port
has increased 133 p.c. since 1919. The
board’s booklet should be in the hands
of every tourist—it contains full infor-
mation about timetables, beauty spots
and district resources, but is small
enough to fit in a pocket.
* * * *
“O’Coen”: The most cheering news
that I have heard for a long time is that
a Melbourne syndicate has “arranged for
three wild tribes” from North Queensland
to attend the Victorian centenary celebra-
tions. A special tract of “North Queens-
land bush country” will be laid out with
an artificial creek running through it and
a “native village” and open spaces to
hold corroborees in. The syndicate will
stand at the gate and take the tickets.
I don’t know whether it has smelt even
one wild tribe or seen it eating its break-
fast, but when it does admission prices
will go up with a bound. Tannery em-
ployees the world over will arrive in
droves to enjoy the homely odor. The
inhabitants of Hit in Mespot. (where the
assafoetida comes from) will immigrate
with their sixpences en masse and sniff
enviously for hours, and the seasick-cure
trade will develop 6000 p.c. during the
first week the strangers are in residence.
The only mistake the promoters are mak-
ing is in putting their charges in a bush-
land setting. They should be housed in
one of Victoria’s many taxation depart-
ments.
* * * *
“O. T. Line”: I have just absorbed
a half-column blurb designed to adver-
tise Imperial Airways’ plane the Astrasa.
It records that the sophisticated niggers
of Bathurst Island, having seen only
about umpteen aeroplanes before, were
“spellbound with amazement when they
saw the great four-engined monoplane
come gliding down.” Their king, how-
ever, plucky fellow, “came near enough
to catch sight of the Royal Mail emblem,
with its crown, on the air-liner’s side”....
He gave a cry of delight, and, pointing to
the crown, declared that he now knew that the
aircraft had come from the King of England,
and he, as the King of Bathurst, must be the
only one to approach the machine, it being
taboo for anyone else to go near it.
As I have found by earnest questioning
that, relatively to distance, the native con-
ception of George V. varies between
“him sergeant belong Melmun” and
“him storekeeper belong Gubmint, gibbit
tchugar, gibbit blanket,” H.M. of Bath-
urst must be an unusually well-informed
monarch. When the Astrsea left he “re-
fused to accept any gift or token, but
drew himself up in truly regal fashion
and gave them a message as from him-
self to H.M. of England.” Any black
who refuses anything is wasted on a mon-
arch. He is a rare museum specimen.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Despite the League of
Nations, which wonders why the New
Guinea kanaka doesn’t sit in the new
local Parliament, the life of that gentle-
man is still held lightly. The other day
the District Court at Rabaul sentenced
five “boys” to be strung up in one
batch for murder in a village in the
Madang hinterland. One obligingly died
in the capital, and the passing of the
other four caused scarcely a ripple in
Territory life. The Madang correspon-
dent of the local paper recorded it well
down in his weekly notes at the end of a
paragraph of official personal news, in
which apparently the most important item
was the appointment of an assistant dis-
trict officer who had gone out with a
cadet to collect taxes.
A scaffold was constructed by the Govern-
ment kong kong, and the necessary formalities
were carried out without a hitch.
What would Mr. Nelson, M.P., say if
they did things like that in the hinterland
of Darwin? And how much smelling
salts would be needed to help the flapper
press recover from its resultant attack
of hysterics?
* * * *
“G. 8.”: Twenty years ago, just before
the outbreak of the war, German New
Guinea had a non-indigenous popula-
tion of 2944. This year the Mandate
census total was 5215. In 1913 the
“whites,” including a sprinkling of Japs,
were 1233 ; now there are 3501 whites and
44 Japs. Chinese have gone back from
1377 to 1353. The Morobe goldfields are
responsible for more than half the in-
crease of whites. Only 379 Germans are
left, but the strangest feature is the de-
cline of Chinese, which old hands refuse
to accept. Rabaul, the capital, has 784
British, 761 Chinese and 311 others ; total,
1856. Natives of the territory are esti-
mated at 666,129, of whom 400,000 have
been enumerated and the rest are guess-
work.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Lady Wilson is a patient in St. Martin’s
Hospital. Victoria Leaguers are sending
flowers each day to their president.
Major and Mrs. Victor Bell are home again
at their Camboon station after eight months’
travel through France, Germany, Switzerland
and Britain. A week’s visit to Sir Matthew
Nathan in his Dorset home was part of their
holiday.
Mashies and niblicks were safe in their lockers
and not a pair of plus-fours, nor a cardigan nor
any tweeds, were to be seen at the Royal Q.
Golf Club end-of-the-season dance. Gigantic
flags of every nation draped the walls of the old
clubhouse, and jardinieres of agapanthus sat
upon tall pedestals. President George Brown
and his silver-haired wife shook hands with the
crowd. She was in black satin with the faintest
whisper of pale pink on the corsage. Blaikie
Webster forgot the worries of Mount Isa and
came along with Mrs. Webster. Associate
champion Mrs. W. F. Gardiner looked effective
in black, with unusual silver sequins ornament-
ing the cape sleeves.
Girl friends of Jean Rigby, who stood at
the altar with William Maurice Shaw, of
Toorak, went to St. Paul’s Church on the
bright sunny afternoon and found a pretty
bride waiting. Jean’s white chiffon frock had
intricate satin strappings adorning the bodice.
A lace veil mounted on a circlet of stephanotis
supported her bouquet of magnolias. Verna
Rudd and Amy Shaw provided a sky-blue satin
horizon for the bride, and each ’maid carried
deep red roses. Dr. Harold Love and Max
Allen looked after the bridegroom. The cake
was cut at Lennon’s, where Mrs. Rigby wel-
comed most of Brisbane’s musicals, for Jean
possesses a beautiful contralto voice. A trip to
Noumea on the Strathnaver was part of the
honeymoon.
Bonnie Bell sailed on the Balranald towards
a London stage career. Bonnie’s mother chap-
erones her. Lady Mayoress Greene is largely
responsible for Bonnie’s trip.
Discussions continue about the unemployed
boys who refuse to take up rural work. There
is a big demand for boys to work on the
land, yet the demand cannot be met. Premier
Forgan Smith is worried about it, and says
that he will welcome suggestions from any
public institution to remedy the objection
parents seem to have of settling their sons oh
the land—he blames the parents for it all.
Stars shining above and twinkling lights below
made Mount Coot-tha kiosk a delightful
place to spend one’s evening, and one’s few
shillings, in aid of the District Nurses.
Although dancing and bridge were provided,
nearly everyone preferred to enjoy the view
from the mountain-top. Gumtips, placed
everywhere, brought a bush atmosphere to the
kiosk.
“Mrs. Moonlight,” with Pat Trace as the
pathetic wife who worried because she never
looked her age, was the Repertory’s latest
offering to members. When Pat lived in Adel-
side she danced her way on to the stage,
often appearing as solo dancer in important
productions. She has taken smaller parts here,
but Mrs. Moonlight was her biggest plum.
The experienced Jum Pendleton shared honors
with her; he played the part of Mr. Moon-
light. Royston Marcus was producer.
Rotarians are brimming over with enthusi-
asm for the joy that Montrose, the home for
crippled children, is to bring to suffering mites.
They gave a party before the official opening
to the donor of the home, George Marchant, on
his 76th birthday. Besides cutting his birth-
day cake, a life-membership badge was pinned
on his coat by the president, Rotarian J. T. Isles.
A sister of J. M. Hickson, who died in
London recently, is Mrs. G. H. Moody, living
at Sandgate. She says her brother began the
practice of faith-healing when a boy. His
grandfather was Dr. Walton, of Melbourne.
In these days when so many overseas ships

Thye a few years ago ? Was he successful
over there ? —9041.
Muir met Abie Coleman, Gus Sonnenberg,
Pat McGill, Strangler Lewis, Ray Steele and
other leading wrestlers. Most of these top-
notchers defeated him; but he was only a
youngster, and learning the game.

tidal rivers of Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf
of Carpentaria. (4) Suitable boats are always
being advertised in Sydney and Brisbane papers.
(5) You will have to do your own curing.
There is no regular market in Australia, so
cannot quote value. France provides the best
market.
1 have a two-ton G.M.C. truck which does
not appear to be giving rated power. (1) Could
I substitute a four-forward gear-box for the
present one ? (2) Would this throw an undue
strain on back axle and differential ? (3)
Would new crown wheel and pinion be neces-
sary ? (4) Effect on pulling power? (5) Any
other suggestions ? —9038.
(1) Could be done, but the cost would be
about £6O. (2) and (3) No. (4) Better perform-
ance, and would have the advantage of extra
gear for hard work. (5) Would advise you to
consult a competent motor engineer, as your
trouble may be due to other causes, such as
slipped timing or brakes dragging on drums.
Possibly the engine may require reboring.
Possibilities of kiln-drying timber, and pros-
pects from an investor’s point of view ? —8863.
Kiln-drying is coming into favor and is being
adopted by a number of firms engaged in the
timber industry. The financial return depends
on cost of installation and on the future of the
Australian building and furniture industries.
How to lubricate the leather washer on the
plunger of a pump ? Would mutton fat be
suitable ? —B9Ol.
Melted mutton fat could be used, but castor
oil is preferable.

/ am a Queenslander who hopes to spend
a little while in Sydney. Where could I get
instruction in blacksmithing, tinsmithing, steam-
engine driving and the operation of internal
combustion motors during my stay ? —-8806.
At Sydney Technical College, Ultimo, pro-
vided your visit occurs while the college is in
session. It closes from November 24 to Febru-
ary 26.
(1) I have a number of Commonwealth
stamps overprinted "Specimen.” Are they
as valuable as the corresponding stamps with-
out overprint ? (2) Why were these stamps so
overprinted? —B723.
(1) They are less valuable than the ordinary
stamps. (2) The P.M.G.’s Dept, placed on sale
complete sets of stamps “cancelled to order,”
some of which included all values up to £2.
Owing to objections raised by philatelists, it
was decided to overprint the higher values
“Specimen.”
Particulars of the platinum-plating process ?
8718.
An electrolyte is used consisting of platinum
ammonium chloride, 2\oz. ; ammonium chloride,
loz.; sodium citrate, 200 z.; water, 1 gallon.
The solution, which is used hot (about 180 deg.
F.), is placed in an enamelled iron vessel. The
anode is of carbon, while the object to be
plated constitutes the cathode. An E.M.F. of
5 or 6 volts is necessary, and the two elec-
trodes should be close together but not touch-
ing. The solution is replenished by the addition
of platinic chloride. For general technique
of electro-plating consult “The Canning Prac-
tical Handbook on Electro-plating,” published
by W. Canning and Co., Great Hampton-street,
Birmingham, England.
How to harden plaster of Paris so that it may
be polished like marble ? —8995.
The plaster should be moistened with a solu-
tion of alum or borax and then again burned.
The resulting compound sets very quickly.
(1) Preparation suitable for preserving copper-
wire gauze ? (2) Suitable mixture for painting
car radiator ? (3) How to apply ? —9007.
(1) “Fishoilene” is a transparent preparation
for this purpose. Obtainable in half-pint
(2s. 6d.) and pint (4s. 3d.) tins from H. P.
Gregory and Co., 24 Clarence-street, Sydney.
(2) Mix 3oz. boiled linseed oil, 4oz. lamp-
black, loz. turpentine and thin down with
turpentine to the proper consistency. (3) The
paint may either be sprayed on the radiator or
the radiator can be placed on a box, face up,
and the mixture applied plentifully so that it
will run through the cellular parts. A camel-
hair brush can be used to reach the parts not
covered.
Can a N.S.W. Shire Council compel a land-
holder to clear undergrowth from vacant allot-
ments ? —8791.
Yes. The landowner can appeal to a Dis-
trict Court Judge if he considers the demand
unreasonable.
(1) How can a boy get a position in the
N.S.W. Lands Department ? (2) Educational
qualification? (3) Commencing salary ?— BB5l.
(1) and (2) Junior clerical staff is recruited
from successful competitors at the Public Ser-
vice entrance exam. Pamphlet is obtainable
from the Public Service Board, 21 Elizabeth-
street, Sydney. (3) Leaving Certificate standard:
Under 16, £B7 p.a.; over 16, £95 p.a. Inter-
mediate Certificate standard: Under 16, £65
p.a.; over 16, £7l 10s. p.a.—all subject to the
provisions of the Public Service Salaries Act,

Brisbane ? (2) Average annual evaporation of
water of Sydney and Brisbane ? (3) Would
either or both Sydney and Brisbane be suitable
for the manufacture of salt from sea water ?
(4) What would be the cost per ton of crude
salt manufactured in this way? (5) Names of
books on the subject ? (6) What are the chief
industrial uses of commercial hydrochloric
acid ? (7) Is there a market for sufficiently
cheap fairly pure hydrochloric acid in Aus-
tralia ? —8769.
(1) Sydney, 47.5 in.; Brisbane, 45.3 in. (2)
Sydney, 36.9 in.; Brisbane, 51.2 in. (3) Salt
could be prepared jjy solar evaporation at
both places. (4) Depends on locality, method
of manufacture and many other factors. (5)
“Report on the Salt Deposits of Canada and
the Salt Industry,” by L. Heber Cole, Can-
adian Department of Mines; Geological Survey
of South Australia, Bulletin No. 8; and text-
books such as “Industrial Chemistry,” by
Martin. (6) It is used in numerous minor in-
dustries ; for example, for pickling iron and
the manufacture of chlorides. (7) It would be
certain to meet intense competition, as one of
the difficulties of the present manufacturers is
to get rid of stocks. The same remark applies
to salt.
In budgeting for a family of two adults and
two children under 12 on £360 per annum,
what percentages should be allotted for food,
clothes, rent, amusement, etc. ? —8755.
This is a difficult question to answer, as every
family must be a law to itself on account of
differences in habits and health. The figures
would require to be averaged over a period of
three years, as many of the heavier items of
clothing and furnishing are not required regu-
larly every year. A suggested budget is: To sav-
ings account, £6O; rent, £7B (less if possible);
clothes for man, £l5; clothes for woman, £l2;
clothes for two children, £l4; food, about
£lOO (depends on district cost of living); house
maintenance and renewals, £10; lighting,
heating and fuel, £l5; doctor and dentist,
£10; amusements, including books, £5. This
leaves £4l for school fees, holidays, chemist,
presents, insurance premiums on furniture, etc.,
and contingencies.
(1) What is the duty on cigarettes imported
from Manila ? (2) How many cigarettes go to
a pound ? —BB9O.
(1) Eighteen shillings per pound, plus primage
duty 10 p.c. and sales tax 5 p.c. (2) About 400.
How is concrete set under water ? —8736.
The mixture is made up 1:2:3, with a very
small allowance of water. It is essential that
there be little or no movement in the water
surrounding the concrete. If there is much
movement a cofferdam must be constructed
around the structure and (in the case of sea
water) concrete must be applied only between
tides. The concrete is sent through a large tube
or box, known as a tremie spout, right to the
bottom. The spout is gently lifted a few inches
at a time as fresh supplies of concrete are
placed.
(1) Names and addresses of Melbourne press
syndicates from which overseas pictures, articles,
short stories, etc., may be purchased for re-
publication in an Australian journal ? (2) Prices
a local publisher would have to pay for Austra-
lian republication rights for (a) news-pictures,
(b) articles, (c) short stories, (d) serials ?— 8951.
(1) “Herald” Feature Service, of Flinders-
street, is the only one we know of, but it deals
mainly with local material. The Yaffa Syndi-
cate, Sydney, carries a wide range of overseas
photographs, articles, stories, etc. (2) Standard
price for news-photographs is 7s. 6d. For
stories, articles, etc., prices vary according to
type, length, authors, etc. Further particulars
can be obtained from the firms mentioned.
Did actor George Coppin participate in
politics ? If so, can you furnish a record of
his political career ? Did he take a leading part
in any public movement ?■ —8994.
In 1858 he was elected to the South-Western
Provincial Council (Vic.), resigning when he
went to America in 1864. In 1874 he was
elected to the East Melbourne seat in the
Assembly, and held it till 1889. He was one of
the founders of the Vic. Humane Society and
of the Old Colonists’ Association; he per-
sistently advocated acclimatisation, and himself
introduced English thrushes.
(1) Amount of war debt owing by Australia to
Britain ? (2) Amount converted (if any) ? (3)
Amount of Britain’s war debt to U.S.A. ? (4)
Present rate of interest ? —BB9B.
(1) As at June 30 last, £79,724,000. (2) Under
the Funding Arrangements Act, 1921, the
amount of indebtedness to the Government of
the United Kingdom (about £92,000,000) was
consolidated and the Commonwealth undertook
to extinguish the debt in about 35 years by
annual payments of £4 18s. 4d. p.c. interest
and £1 Is. Bd. p.c. capital. (3) and (4) As at
March 31 last, £925,500,000. Of this
£897,500,000 is repayable at 3 p.c. interest and
i p.c. sinking fund annually. This £897,500,000
includes £28,000,000 of interest payable in
1931-32, which was suspended under the Hoover
moratorium, and which is repayable with in-
terest at 4 p.c. in 10 equal annuities commenc-
ing December 15 next. A further £28,000,000
consists of p.c. bonds maturing 1937. The
annual interest liability is approximately
£28,750,000 from December next.
Conditions of prize competition for an Aus-
tralian play or talkie scenario being conducted
by Efftee Films, Melbourne? —8839.
The competition is open to any person who
has been a resident of Australia for six months.
Play must be suitable for screen or stage; stage
plays of 2|-hours’ duration. The author will
be paid royalties on stage production, and the
complete copyright will become the property
of Efftee Film Productions. All manuscripts
must be typewritten and forwarded to Efftee
Film Productions; closing date, December 1,
1933. Efftee Film Productions are to have
the first refusal of any play submitted. All
plays must be marked “Competition Play” on
the front page of MS. Author’s name and
address must appear plainly on MS.
Meaning of “Maru,” part of the name of all
Japanese ships ? —BB4O.
Originally an honorific applied to the central
or most important part of anything, such as
a room in a castle. Same significance to-day,
though now only applied to ships.
What does the Mandate given by the League
of Nations to Australia for the German pos-
sessions in the Pacific say about the military
training of the natives and the erection of forti-
fications ? —9012.
Article 4 of the Mandate prohibits the mili-
tary training of the natives otherwise than for
purposes of internal police and the local de-
fence of the territory. No military or naval
bases may be established or fortifications erected
in the territory.
What difference in meaning is there between
“scream,” “shriek” and “screech” ? —8983.
“Scream” is the usual word for a cry uttered,
under emotion, at a higher pitch than is
normal with the utterer. “Shriek” is used to
convey something shriller and sharper than
“scream.” The essence of “screech” is harsh-
ness, discordance or a quality of weirdness.
Was Pitcairn Island inhabited before the
mutineers of the Bounty arrived there in
1790 3—9005.
When the mutineers arrived there it was
uninhabited, but stone axes, stone pillars,
carved figures and skeletons with mussel shells
placed beneath their heads have been found
on the island. Very little is known concerning
these original inhabitants.
Can you tell me anything about the hurri-
cane at Samoa when ' American and German
warships were wrecked ? —9020.
It occurred on March 15, 1889. Every ship
at Apia, except H.M.S. Calliope, was de-
stroyed. The U.S.A. lost the Trenton, Van-
dalia and Nipsic, and Germany the Adler,
Eber and Olga. About 50 Americans and 96
Germans were drowned. The Calliope, stoked
with Westport (M.L.) coal, risked her boilers
and steamed out to sea in the teeth of the
gale.
What it the Bertillon system ? —9028.
The invention of Alphonse Bertillon, it con-
sists of a careful measurement of parts of
the human body which remain unchanged after
full growth. By these it is possible to identify
positively any individual once measured for the
rest of his life. The system was adopted by
the police in most civilised countries. The
essential measurements are length and breadth
of head, and lengths of middle finger, left
foot and forearm from elbow to tip of middle
finger. Height, length of little finger and
color of eyes are also recorded. In 1897 the
system was superseded in India, for police pur-
poses, by Galton’s finger-print records, a system
which was adopted in Britain three years later.
Since the settlement of Australia how many
species of birds have become extinct, and what
caused their disappearance ? —8874.
Five or six species have become extinct. Or
these the small emus of Kangaroo Island and
King Island and the Tasmanian form of the
common emu were destroyed by white settlers.
The causes of the disappearance of certain other
birds, such as the noisy scrub-bird and black-
throated coachwhip-bird of W.A., the parra-
keet of Queensland and the night parrot ot
the spinifex country of the interior, are doubt-
ful. Naturalists attribute their disappearance
to cats and bushfires; to others it seems prob-
able that they were on the borderland of ex-
tinction before the arrival of white settlers.
Brief Answers.

known method of doing this permanently....
J.H.: It was received here regularly until a
few years ago, but is now not listed in any
of the Indian press directories T.C.: Trellis
and Blind Co., of Bridge-street, Petersham.
■• • -H.P.W.: Write Under-Secretary, Agriculture
Dept., Brisbane... .T.G.L.: “Strand Magazine,”
Southampton-street, Strand, W.C.2; “Pear-
son’s Magazine,” 18 Henrietta-street, W.C.2 ;
and “Windsor Magazine,” Warwick House,
Salisbury-square, E.C.4—all London G. 8.:
Write Building Relief Committee, Chalfort
Chambers, 142 Phillip-street, Sydney T.H.P.:
Know of no book solely devoted to greenhouse
construction and management. Brunning’s
“Australian Gardener,” 7s. 6d., has a chapter
on the subject... .E.F.8.: Every receipt for
40s. or upwards requires to have affixed a
South Aust. duty stamp for 2d A.R.G.:
Burns, Philp, at Port Moresby, Suva and Sama-
rai ; Whitten Bros., at Port Moresby and
Samarai ; and Morris, Hedstrom and Co.,
at Suva... .V.M.E.D.: Write N.S.W. Agricul-
ture Dept., Sydney, for leaflet “Disease of
Animals,” No. 5... .G.H.: Your recipe is satis-
factory, but you should make it up freshly
every time with yeast. By adding some of the
old beer you are collecting increased quantities
of matured alcohol, and your beer is probably
well over the 2 per cent, alcohol content
allowed by the Customs for home brews...„

(155.) and Kemp’s “Alternating Current Electri-
cal Engineering” (275.), from Angus and Robert-

certified copy may be obtained on payment of
stamp duties and writing fees. Write to the
Officer in Charge, giving full particulars. (2)
Write to the editor or publisher of the news-
paper, giving date E.8.H.: Does not come
within the scope of “bogus advertisements”
punishable under the Crimes Act. Purchaser
would have difficulty in establishing a claim
for damages if opportunity was given him to
overhaul and test the car beforehand....
V. : Apparently a case of joint ownership
where no individual owner can dispose of the
property, or what he deems to be his share of
it, without the other owners being parties in
the sale... .A.M.: (1) It does not come within
the list of exemptions. (2) You could open a
trust account. Cheques are not used, money
being taken out by signing a withdrawal form
to be presented at the bank together with the
depositor’s pass book. There is no limitation;
the account may be kept alive by a credit
balance of one shilling. No charge is made for
keeping account, and duty stamps are not re-
quired on withdrawal forms... .Z.8.M.W.: (1)

registered with the Nurses’ Registration Board,
93 Macquarie-street, Sydney... .E.W.M.: Write
Lysaght Bros., 17 Bridge-street, Sydney
W. : It is not practicable to secure a bona
fide list.... J.A.: Don’t take it without medical
advice. Doubt whether palatable beer could be
made under these conditions.. . .T.J.K.: Many
Macquarie-street practitioners specialise in chest
conditions. The cure depends on the individual
case and is a long business. There is no book
for laymen dealing with the subject. Medical
attention is imperative H.L.D.: You will
probably grow more yet. To put on more
weight, have three glasses of milk a day. Have
an egg every day. No special exercises are indi-
cated, but take plenty of outdoor exercise....
H.S.: (1) and (2) You will probably get a series
of cocodyl compounds and also HCN (hydro-
cyanic acid). The whole reaction is extremely
complex in nature and very dangerous owing to
the highly poisonous nature of the residue. (3)
Not clear as to your meaning. (4) Doubtful
whether you would get a tetranytrate; the whole
action is very uncertain... .S.N.: There is no
provision for the issue of marriage licenses in
N.S.W. Arrangements for a marriage should
be made direct with the minister, and the ques-
tion of notice is a matter between the parties
and the celebrant... .J.R.: Can’t say what’s
wrong without examination. It is clear the rifle
needs attention to prevent accident. Send it
to Cowles and Dunn, 71 King-street, Sydney.
J.F.H.: (1) It is an expression of Tschai-
kowsky’s emotions on the subject of Napoleon’s
retreat from Moscow. (2) It is one of a group
of 24 “pianoforte portraits” (op. 10) in which
Rubinstein endeavored to give musical expres-
sion to various concrete ideas. The piece you
refer to is the only one of the series still in
favor, and this principally because of its peda-
gogic value... .8.D.: Don’t know any English

Chaffey (45), Drummond (43), Main (50),

The Australian Canning Co., financed
by English capital, has started turtle-
catching and -canning at Cossack (W.A.).
It aims at an output of 1000 tins of soup
a day. Turtles of the green-backed vege-
tarian type are the variety handled.
* * * *
“Stave”: One of the few skilled trades
which modern machinery has not been
able to oust is coopering. After the war
it suffered a knock-back in Britain owing
to the whisky slump and the falling-off
of the herring trade. There has been a
big revival since the virtual abolition of
prohibition in America. Scottish coopers
are working overtime on casks for the
American whisky trade, and in England
the men who make the beer containers
are equally busy.
* * * *
“Trapper”: Silver-fox fur-farming has
proved such a success in Britain that
some enthusiasts are talking of introduc-
ing the business here. The trade is pro-
fitable—a good skin brings £4O to £50 —
but there is little chance of permits to
import the beasts being granted. The
question was considered by the N.S.W.
agricultural authorities when the craze
for fur-rabbits was at its height. It was
decided that, since ordinary foxes had
proved a pest, no fur foxes be permitted
here on any account.
*.* * %
“Noils”: The knitting craze which has
taken womanhood by the wool in more
senses than one has had a great deal to do
with the upward glide of prices for the
Australian staple. A Yorkshire inventor
has done his best to help the good work
along by putting knitting needles on the
market each of which has a tiny electric
light at the point, fed by a dry battery in
the shaft. The main idea behind it is
that it will enable the cinema-going
thousands to watch the pictures while
knitting, which can be checked off as
occasion arises by the glow on the
needle-points.
* =N * *
“Biltong”: The artistry of the new
pound and 10s. notes may be defensible
or not, but the quality of the paper is
beyond defence. No private bank in
Australia ever put such fragile paper
money into circulation. The most dila-
pidated banknotes I have ever seen were
those current in South Africa 40 years
ago. Torn and greasy and gummed to-
gether, they made a poor ad. for the
banks that issued them. There were no
“ones,” either; the lowest denomination
was a £4 note. Our paper pounds and
half-sovereigns naturally have ten times
as much work to do as their richer rela-
tives, and they aren’t made of the stuff
to stand up to it.
* * * *
“Esters”: Australian wines should have
a great advertisement in the U.S.A. if
the advice of D. M. Dow, secretary for
this country in Uncle Samland, is taken.
An international wine show is to be held
at New York in February ; the exhibits
are later to tour the country, and it seems
a fine opening for our wine-makers. The
Commonwealth Government might help
by stipulating for the inclusion of our
magnificent light beverage wines of the
hock and claret types. The Australian
wines most pushed abroad are the heavy
liqueur sorts, on which an export bounty
is paid. The best of these, good as they
are, are not equal to the leading vintages
of the Continent, whereas some of our
lighter wines are better than many carry-
ing historic labels.
SP * * *
“FY7”: Australia’s century-old trade
with India in horses, though shorn of a lot
of its former glory, still carries on. The
other day the first shipment of the season
left Melbourne: mostly remounts for
the Army in India, together with polo
ponies and racing thoroughbreds—6oo
all told. S. Margrett, one of the oldest
buyers in the game, who was in charge
of most of the shipment, has the same
tale to tell that one hears from others in
the trade. Australia has now to be tooth-
combed for types that 40 years ago could
be picked up in quantity in nearly every
State. This year Margrett had to cover
more of the country than ever to com-
plete his shipment—the 54th. At one
South Aus. sale he looked over 1700
horses and found only two worth his
money. But sons and daughters of Wind-
bag, Heroic, Spearfelt, Rampion and the
like will steadily make a difference.
* * * *
“Latex”: A hundred new uses would
be found for rubber if you could get
rid of the smell. In the case of planta-
tion rubber most of this is attributable
to the sulphur or nitrogenous accelera-
tors used in curing. No substitute has
yet been found for these, but it is now
claimed that the addition of zinc car-
bonate during the manufacturing process
reduces the smell to a minimum. So
it is suggested that we are going to have
rubber milk-cans, brewing vats, casks and
food-containers.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Martin-place bloomed with the black
lily of the loudspeaker last week when
John and Jane Citizen were being told
intimate things about the goings-on be-
neath their skins. Sydney was being
healthy in word and sometimes in deed.
But not all of us. The Minister for
Health was sick, and if he can’t keep
himself well, what about the rest? Still
Prof. Harvey Sutton, Dr. Purdy, physi-
cal-culturist Bjelke Petersen and racial-
hygienist Mrs. Goodisson pushed the
programme through, and if there’d been
time to run around all the lectures in the
city you’d have been qualified to set up
both as doctor and dentist. Day nur-
series and baby centres were inspected,
feminists were instructed in vocational
psychology, the virtues of sun and milk
were expounded. Advice was as free as
air.
Sydney is to have its first birth-con-
trol clinic. It is to be in Martin-place.
Now the Girl in the Flat Opposite is
wondering if there will be a chance of
a job for her young cousin. His ambi-
tion is to be a traffic policeman.
The rain fell in a thick, grey curtain,
it swirled around the ankles, it hissed
malignantly on brolly and raincoat. It
was the wettest November rain Sydney,
rubber-booted, has ever squelched
through, but according to schedule
Mayoress Hagon held her party. And
once within the damask-curtained rooms
you’d never have guessed that dirty
weather raged without. No woman had
worn her old clothes. The topcoat and
umbrella of her who had come by tram
were smuggled by the attendants into some
deep lair off the red-carpeted palm jungle
which on ordinary days is a long, arid
corridor. Every woman, proud or
humble, had to climb the marble stairs
to the tea-leaf roystering. For the civic
fathers were in conclave, and to ascend
by the lift means passing through the
Council Chamber, and its doors were
closed to woman in slacks, tights or
petticoats.
Not as far as one could see were any
slacks or tights on the horizon. The
guests were sprightly-hatted and sleekly-
frocked. Lady Game was very smart,
for a wet day, in a white crepe frock on
which smiled a family of tiny daisies that
were all in mourning. Her hat was white
and wide. Beflowered grey crepes and
a black sailor hat were worn by the
hostess; but Dame Clara Butt, in her
Paisley wrap, with its sable-like collar
and cuffs, was the dominating figure of
the afternoon. Hugh Denison’s lady and
Mark Sheldon’s turned up in price-
less furs; Mrs. Walter Burfitt’s black-
and-white hat held the gaze, as did Mrs.
Leishman’s yellow roses on a black Per-
sian-lamb collar. Mrs. Geoffrey Hughes
topped her pencil slimness with a check
sailor hat; Mrs. Alfred Lee pinned a
white gardenia on her black satin coat.
Mrs. A. E. Grace and Mrs. E. Wunder-
lich were a handsome pair ; Hubert Mur-
ray’s lady, in Burgundy crepes and a
hat of like coloring, came in Lady
Game’s company ; Mrs. Roy Hendy and
Mrs. Frank Crane, Mrs. David Maughan,
in her favorite black-and-white, and Mrs.
Godhard, who swung a Cossack cape
from the shoulders of her black frock,
were among the joymakers.
If the Orford had been a sailing-ship
its young visitors last week would, no
doubt, have swarmed up the mizzen; as
it was, neither the captain’s bridge nor
the Orford’s gun was sacred to them.
They gambolled and rollicked above and
below stairs, they slid down the moun-
tainous slippery slide, they roared at the
old, old story of Punch and Judy, and
they patronised impartially the hoop-las,
the lucky dips and the fizzy drinks.
Charity presented in such guise is
golden indeed, and young Australia en-
joyed itself, and at the same time helped
the Adult Deaf and Dumb unemployed.
The State Governor’s lady, who was pre-
sident of the committee, and Lady Isaacs
were received by the Calvert Andrews
and the Orford’s commander, Captain
Owens. Mrs. Milner Stephen and Wil-
liam Brooks, both strong supports of the
society, busily buzzed through the after-
noon. Mrs. Harry Dransfield, Mrs. Roy-
stone Davey and Mayoress Hagon were
among the helpers.
“Only God can make a tree,” the poet
sings, but Douglas Pratt makes such good
pencil sketches of them that crowds
turned up to the opening of his before-
Christmas show. National Gallery trus-
tee Waterhouse made the opening re-
marks, and the Grosvenor Galleries
echoed to applause, led by the Hubert
Murray lady, Mrs. Hubert Fairfax and
Mrs. Kelty. The last-named was particu-
larly interested in the tree-lined way,
“The Road to Blayney,” which is near
her old home Coombing Park. Mrs.
Pratt’s suit of Persian reds and her pale
yellow hat toned in admirably with the
Chinese bowls of loquats and lilies which
were the afternoon’s decorations. Lister
Lister, Howard Hinton, her State Ex.
and General Anderson have visited the
show.
This is a new picture of Air Com-
modore Kingsford Smith’s pretty wife.
She was to have been one of the honored
guests of the Welcome-home Ball
arranged by the Flying Corps Association
in honor of her husband, Charlie Ulm
and G. U. Allan, but an unfortunate cold
kept her at home. The ball lured 400
dancers to Nock and Kirby’s Pompa-
dour room, gay with the association’s
flags and colors. The record-breaking
flights were marvelled at all over again,
and Gordon Taylor’s absence was noted
with regret. Major A. W. L. Ellis and
Mrs. Ellis did the honors, and Cressida
Jackson was a visitor from Maoriland
in green checked organdie. It’s a Howard
Harris picture.
The life story of the Prince of Wales
brought Sydney running to the Prince
Edward. A vestibule brilliant with flags
stirred up the nerve cells to the proper
patriotic fervor, and once in view of
the silver sheet the famous smile com-
pleted the conquest. To the gala in the
evening came a vice-regal party. Lady
Isaacs’s cobalt-blue velvet coat had
a deep collar of squirrel; Lady Game’s
black velvet wrap had a snowline of
Arctic fox, and covered a slim frock in
her favorite green. Black velvet was
worn by Mrs. Harry Levy, Lady Isaacs’s
sister; the Hubert Murray lady brought
unusual cherry and white chevron stripes
to the party; Sadie Budge, Commander
Gifford, rosy and smiling, and the Hon.
Greville Baird, rather grave-looking,
were others in the Government House
group. The City Mission and Prince
Alfred’s shared the takings of the first
day’s three releases, and a non-stop sale
of flowers from Moss Vale, Lithgow and
Castle Hill, arranged by Mrs. C. H. Hos-
kins, gave the Castlereagh-street entrance
color and fragrance throughout the day.
One of the gayest of the week’s mid-
day meetings was the Bookplate Society s
lunch for G. B. Lancaster, the unassum-
ing little author of that great book
“Pageant.” Dr. George Mackaness uttered
words of praise, and P. R. Stephensen
swung a censer to the gifted writer.
Toasts were drunk in water, but lost
none of their fervor for it. Mary Gil-
more passed around a book of her own
verse, and secured the signatures of the
company with a view to having the much-
autographed copy sold for one of the
many causes under her wing.
Henrietta Drake-Brockman dashed
over from the West last week and em-
barked on a rush of interviews with pub-
lishers and Cinesound. In one interval
The Bulletin camera got this record
of her well-groomed head. Her two
Bulletin serials, “Blue North” and
“Men Among Pearls,” deal with the pearl
fisheries of North Westralia—a back-
ground which the author knows intimately
through journeyings with her engineer
husband. “Blue North” is to be published
in book form by the Endeavour Press.
The Drake-Brockmans are among the
pioneer families of the West —they
took root there in 1829, and the
Grace Bussell whose exploit in riding
into a raging surf to rescue the sur-
vivors of the Georgette is so graphically
described in “Blue North” is the mother-
in-law of the author. Mrs. Drake-Brock-
man’s mother, Dr. Jull, is famed, too,
and on one occasion was part of the
Australian delegation to Geneva. This
writing woman, by the way, set out early
in life to become a brush-and-palette
artist.
Captain Le Pelletier, of the French
man-o’-war Aldebaran, and a group of
his officers went to the dance on the
Nieuw Zeeland; France’s Consul-
General and Mrs. Dussap were also on
deck, so the affair had quite an inter-
national tone. The Governor-General’s
lady came after the Prince Edward
show, and with her mastery of the
French tongue must have been a great
acquisition to the official group. Charles
Rosenthal and F. T. Berman represented
the Veterans’ Home at La Perouse and
the Australian Forest League, which
were the reason for the gaiety ; and a
group of Frances Scully’s pupils put a
dash of the romantic into the night with
their interpretation of “The Blue Dan-
ube.” General manager for the Royal
Packet Navigation Company A. Bakker
and Mrs. Bakker were importants, and
Mrs. W. G. Adams added royal-blue
laces to a night colorful with bright
lights, flowers and bunting.
Women welfare workers were plunged
into grief last week by the death of Mrs.
C. E. Austin, a founder of the National
Y.W.C.A. and general secretary for the
past five years. Mrs. Austin was a
woman of charm and wide culture, and
was loved by the women and girls whom
she so unselfishly served. The National
Council of Women, the Travellers’ Aid
Society, the Australian Institute of In-
dustrial Psychology, the Boys and Girls’
Employment Committee and innumer-
able other activities were the richer for
her sympathy and fine organising brain.
Mrs. Austin was the widow of padre
A. H. Austin, a Congregational minister
who was for some time in Brisbane, and
who served as a chaplain with the A.I.F.
One of the unexpected bits of Sydney
is the Repertory Theatre in Kent-street.
Here the drama flourishes under the min-
istrations of Scott Alexander in a long,
wide room that was once a school hall.
Now the windows are cosily hung with
chintz ; there are pictures on the wall;
and last Saturday night, when the manne-
quin play “Nine Till Six” was taking the
boards, the rich perfume of flowers was
added. The flowers, a blaze of glory
to slow-footed summer, were massed on
tables near the stage. In the play, which
is an Adamless Eden, good work was
done by Muriel Connor, as the much-
tried Mrs. Pembroke, and by Lilian War-
ren, as the fascinating little Cockney,
Grade Abbot. Maureen Leeper, a
youngster from Warwick (Q.), kept the
laughs simmering as the vulgar little
Violet.
The Women Painters with hope in their
hearts have hung the walls of Gayfield
Shaw’s Gallery in Wembley Chambers
with the work of their hands. It is
bright work ; it has the sun in it, and
the wind in it. It has drifting cloud and
lakes and trees and dogs and children ;
and for a few guineas you can have your
choice. Alexander Gordon’s lady opened
the show with the right word and smile,
and president Marie Irvine struck her
usual note of forceful optimism.
lima Barnes and her group are giving
two matinees for children next Tuesday
and Wednesday. There are so few bills
of amusement for children that Sydney
mothers and fathers should be glad of
the chance to let the kiddies hear the
carols and rhymes, tunes and mimes, and
the dramatisation of the evergreen Milne
poems.
Christmas is coming; the first Santa
Claus descended on the Domain a few
days ago. Now children are busy think-
ing of hanging up their stockings, and
their poor papas are getting into condi-
tion to go on short commons. The
other morning, very early, a friend
stepped into Centennial Park for a spot
of exercise, and he declares the place
was inhabited by too-old-at-forty men
sprinting along, stern resolution on their
faces, a restraining hand supporting the
over-plumpness of their bowler-hat
fronts.
A Madonna of Germanic coloring
carved out of a single block of wood by
the Judas of the Oberammergau Passion
Play, and a font modelled and burned by
Anton Lang, the Christ of the world-
famed cast, who is a potter by trade, are
two of the interesting possessions
gathered in her travels by Sydney’s only
Papal countess, Eileen Freehill. This
public-spirited lady, who has just given
£lO,OOO towards building a chapel at St.
Patrick’s College, Manly, lives in a
flower-and-tree-surrounded home at
Point Piper. On the wide sill of the sun
porch is a quotation from the Book of
Kells which, freely translated, means
“May the light of Heaven illumine your
days.”
Kathleen Orr was ushered through the
portals of matrimony by padre Sydney
Evans at the sign of St. Stephen s in
Phillip-street last Thursday. The bride
made an effective entry in ivory satin
and tulle, and was followed by Hope
Ryrie, of Tarcoola, Goulburn, m gold
satin, her hands filled with, brilliant zin-
nias. James Campbell Irwin, of Mount
Lofty (S.A.), was the man waiting witn
the ring, and. brother Robert gave
his support. Kathleen’s parents, the O-
W. Orrs, of Gladswood Gardens, staged
a reception at the Forum Club, Mrs.
Orr’s red roses cheering her black laces,
while pink carnations did likewise tor
Mrs. Irwin’s cigar-brown frocking.
Oswald Cheeke sends greetings to Syd-
ney friends from England, where he is

Chatter
There was weather to order for Hen-
ley. 1 The industrious plying of needles
upon silks, satins, frills and flounces cul-
minated in canoes filled with gaudy
cushions. Here, like princesses, reclined
the misses who had sewed so industri-
ously, while their swains of the moment
paddled them up and down the Yarra.
Across the lawns surged organdie. Hands
Were filled with kewpie sticks and woolly
monkeys, so a cartwheel hat sometimes
eloped with an impish puff of wind.
White organdie clad the “Best-dressed
Henley Girl.” She and 17 other damsels,
culled from a mob of less successful
entrants, were invited to remain for tea
upon the houseboat used for judging.
Some girls wore shorts, slacks and san-
dals, and others looked especially attrac-
tive in linen suits.
In the evening the houseboats twinkled
themselves into a quartette of shimmer-
ing dragonflies. The Amateur Sports’ ark
was all orange and lemon lights to match
its myriads of paper flowers. The presi-
dent’s was gold pricked with green, the
Henley Subscribers’ blushed rosy-pink.
The Fairbairn knight and his lady enter-
tained afloat, as did Mayor Gengoult
Smith ; several hundreds had his cards
of entree for either afternoon or evening.
Among gold lights pricked here and
there with blue and a Chinatown of lan-
terns, guests nibbled strawberries and
cream and swallowed the liquors of the
bar. The host wore a boiled shirt. Nor-
man Bayles was one of the men who
kept him company. Most of the women
gave their race frocks another outing.
Cynthia Brookes (in a fur coat) and a
couple of her bridesmaids sipped their
coffee amidships. The fireworks included
rockets bursting into shimmery constella-
tions of sequins and brief illusions of
spidery fronds. Two mauve and green
donkeys frisked about during their too
brief existence, a mannikin sprang into
being from the crack of a pink-and-blue
gun, and a decanter and glasses and a
fiery serpent drew shudders from folk
who had reason to remember the night
before.
Perfect weather blessed the last two
days at Kooyong. Harry Hopman gave
shorts a trial on Friday, but evidently
found them not conducive to his play,
and scored his victory in the doubles on
Saturday in long flannel pants. Young
bride Mrs. Jack Hawkes won a plum
for attraction in her white linen suit with
navy scarf, white-spotted. Enid Murdoch
plunged into a brick-red outfit. The
Gerald Patterson and Bob Schlesinger
couples were there. The Norman
Brookes family was in the front row
(with padded seats and armrests) of the
“lifers’ ” stand. Desmond Ahern, in grey
suit and brown hat, was made much of.
On Saturday the overflow hung on by
its eyelashes. It perched perilously on
roofs, rails and fences, and swung its
legs from the bridges. Among the spec-
tators girls sunburned delightedly in
short-sleeved frocks and infinitesimal hats
—their mothers tied scarfs and pinned
programmes round their necks, and their
fathers tucked outsize hankies into their
hats. One woman wore backless linen.
Some frocks had criss-cross lattice backs
—a grim thought for their evening gowns.
Mrs. Crawford played in her favorite
mode, sleeveless with a low-cut back. For
the final of the mixed doubles both she
and Joan Hartigan wore eyeshades and
eschewed stockings.
“I swear by Almighty God that I will
be faithful and bear true allegiance to
his Majesty King George as lawful
sovereign of Great Britain, Ireland and
the State of Victoria.” Thus affirmed
the Peacock lady when sworn in as our
first woman M.L.A. The new lawmaker
was inconspicuously dressed in black,
with a white band upon her small hat.
Hereafter she will wear her soft fluffy
hair uncovered while sitting in the House.
On the day of the Peacock lady’s Par-
liamentary initiation, Mrs. Rischbieth
gave a display of weapons used in the
women’s suffrage war round about 1910.
Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst were
pictured, in gaol and leading a procession
75,000 strong; also Muriel Matters, who
chained herself to a grille in the gallery
and shouted her views at the House below.
There were banners and flags, copies of
the “Suffragette” and pictures of fiery-
eyed women whitewashing “Votes for
Women” upon fences and pavements. In
contrast there was a group of the women
mayors of England, self-possessed and
rather smug. Millicent Fawcett’s name is
inscribed upon a tablet placed to her
memory in Westminster Abbey, and the
militant Mrs. Pankhurst, modelled in
bronze, looks ever towards the Houses
of Parliament —which goes to show that
you never can tell what will happen in
the next generation. Perhaps if we
women had had to bite and scratch our
way to the franchise in this country there
would not be such a hectic scurry to get
our names on the rolls a day or so before
they close.
The maroon Rolls-Royce with lackeys
to match called at the tall E., S. and A.
Bank Buildings, wherein the Lyceum
Club occupies the topmost eyrie. The
occasion was a party revolving round the
presentation of a wedding gift to the
Wattle League’s patron, Gengoult Smith
—a bound-in-forest-green-suede volume
all about wattle. Hon. sec. Alice
Richardson, who handed a bushland
offering (leaves and gumnuts, twisted
round a diminutive log) to Miss Brookes,
wore a dash of scarlet for scarf, a little
white hat and a fur coat exactly the
same color as her hair.
Jjmid Coy trailed ivory panne velvet up
the aisle of St. Mary’s, Caulfield, to the
altar, where Vincent Sharpe waited.
Raglan sleeves, very full to the elbow and
thence tight to the wrist, and a snugly fit-
ting neckline were features of the bridal
garment. A high coronet of blossoms
anchored a cloud of tulle veil. Julia
Hale ’maided in Egyptian-green cloque
satin, the net yoke being strewn with
velvet flowers. Her hair fluffed through
apertures in her green toque, and her
fingers were hidden in a shirred muff.
A Dickinson-Monteath camera caught
the smile of the wife of Wing-Com-
mander Harrison. The lady is an enthu-
siast for the Air Force Officers’ Wives
and Mothers’ Association, a body which
guarantees to educate children of officers
who have lost their lives in the service—
for even in times of peace there are acci-
dents. By conspiracies with the Educa-
tion Department and various good
schools it has provided for all children
over 11. But it aims at getting them
younger and keeping them longer—an
annual dance being the biggest money-
getter. This year it was in the Ormond
Hall and last year at Laverton. Mrs.
Harrison is a daughter of G. M.
Prendergast, M.L.A.
Our rodents are rejoicing with de-
lighted squeaks, for Melbourne is on the
warpath against stray cats. The albino
rat who has lived for years in a Collins-
street newspaper office doesn’t hide
behind things any more. He licks his
whiskers in full view of the office and
feasts his little pink eyes by the hour on
his favorite, the gardening editor. An
anonymous donor has provided the
Animal Welfare League with a convey-
ance and the wages of its crew to be en-
gaged in the collection of half-starved
felines. The animals will not tear one
another to bits, for each will occupy a
private compartment on its way to a
painless execution.
This is Mabel Appleton, who, with her
sister, has a family of puppets ready to
entertain the youngest guests at children’s
parties. The dolls are worked back
stage of the little theatre on the Punch-
and-Judy principle; among them are
gauzy fairies, cunning little gnomes, a
king and queen and a complete cast for
“The Sleeping Beauty.” The sisters are
daughters of the F. C. Appletons —her
stage name was Jennie Brice. As chil-
dren they had a “Golden Age Theatre”
of their own. It was built by their father,
and their mother’s needle plied an exten-
sive wardrobe for its wood-and-sawdust
inhabitants. Broothorn made the portrait.
Russell Grimwade,. who gave Captain
Cook’s cottage to Melbourne, is chair-
man of the new arts committee set up
by the centenary council. He remarked
the other day that “we have here the
germ of a permanent arts committee to
give expert advice on matters of taste,
such as the style of public buildings, the
position of statues and so forth.” It may
be so, but the body is constituted much
like the body which recommended that
the Cook cottage should be dumped in
front of the National Gallery. Still, there
are two painters and an architect on it.
A breeze from the West:
Royal Perth Yacht Club spread its canvas
and sailed into the season with races in the
afternoon and a dance at night. Balconies,
bunting, flags and palms were commissioned
for the evening, and billiard-tables carried the
supper. Old hand Lew Beasley was there
squiring his ebony-lace-clad wife; Ena Cock-
ram looked nautical with a spanking feather
boa rigged above marine-blue sand crepe;
Dorothy Summerhayes sprouted wings from her
Watteau floral taffetas; Katie Venn’s newly-
acquired sun-tan showed through the deep slit
in. the back of her white matalasse; Pat Rowe
held blue florals in place with a diamente clasp;
Pat Lang strapped a velvet cape to Christmas-
tree lace, and Gladys Hadley’s and Mrs. Harry
Merry’s smiles belied the mournful tones of
their raiment.
Canon Burton’s sketch “Perth Gossip” was
the piece de resistance at the Historical Society’s
winding up of the season function. Karrakatta
Club’s dais represented the Clifton homestead
Australind in 1856, with several descendants
of the old folk playing the parts of their fore-
bears, whose musical fancies were sung by the
company. Mr. and Mrs. I. Birtwistle, as John
Garrett Bussell and Mrs. George Eliot, gave a
duet. Supper speeches and old-time dancing
completed the fare.
Prof. H. E. Whitfeld launched the W.A.
Society of Arts’ Exhibition at Boati’s Gallery,
with an intro, by president J. Macleod—recog-
nisable from Margaret Johnston’s pastel por-
trait. Secretary Mrs. E. St. Clair Coghill smiled
blandly after pre-opening exertions, and vice-
president Russell-Smith’s versatile wife peered
at the hangings in cool green and white. Mrs.
H. M. Southern’s brown ensemble paced beside
daughter Muriel’s gumnut-toned marocains, and
the Jagos, mother and daughter, compared
offerings with Lionel’s recently-exhibited land-
scapes.
“The Constant Nymph” tripped unfalteringly
into popularity with crowded houses at the
Repertory Club Theatre. Olive Dean handled
the reins of production with a deft and skilful
touch. Joyce Fuller’s Tess brought a tear
to the eye, and Brian Curlewis was thoroughly
at home as Lewis Dodd. Jimmy Ottaway’s
Robert called for laughter and honorable men-
tion.
Misty green floral gaz de soi and a wide-
brimmed tagel chapeau served to outfit Mrs.
A. J. Herman when she put on a tea-and-
music programme for the Little Citizens’
Kindergarten. Guests wormed their wu past
a galaxy of flowers and found comfy seats in
her travel-collection-studded salon. Mrs. Mary
Farrelly said “thank you” for the profits
accrued.
Grace Stapledon gave a dexterous fling to a
length of blue satin, girded her streamlines with
it and whizzed into citizenship at a dance given
by her parents at their West Perth home. Mrs.
Stapledon’s black Chantillies were set off by
roses culled from her garden.
Linley Wislon’s dance recital at His Majesty’s
was an eye-opener to some of Perth’s tappers
and steppers. Terpsichorean classics were inter-
preted with Pavlovian settings and accompanied
by an orchestra under the direction of com-
poser Edward Black. Gwendolyn Piesse was
responsible for a novel “Dance of the Spoken
Word,” in which three poems, delivered by
Florence Dain’s speaking choir, were translated
into rhythm
Dan Cupid scored a couple of bull’s-eyes in
the summer archery contest. Bells will peal in
the new year for victims Frank Johnson and
Nancy Grasby.
The gaieties of Adelaide:—-
The sun shone for the opening of the Royal
Yacht Squadron’s season, an event that afforded
the girls scope for fancy costumes. Most of
them looked as if they had stepped out of a
musical comedy. Cream flannel sailor rigs were
numerous; some were in shorts, others chose
slacks in all colors. Commodore T. C. Angove
and his partners, R. H. Martin and T. Cromp-
ton, entertained on the Stormy Petrel, where
Mesdames Angove and Martin were hostesses.
There was a dance in the evening at the club-
house, which was gay with bunting. The men
came in flannels and the girls wore cotton
frocks.
At Tattersall’s meeting at Morphettville. Mrs.
Morris wore black cire satin and blouse of white
crinkled satin, with a black straw picture hat.
Mayoress Glover was in a black wool de
Chine coat and a small black hat. Mrs. Keith
Angas provided a vivid note in a sealing-wax-
red sand crepe suit and a red hat.
Betty, only daughter of Brig.-General Leane,
Commissioner of Police, and Mrs. R. L. Leane,
was married to Aubrey V. Clutterbuck at Holy
Trinity. The pretty bride wore the orthodox
white satin and veil.
The Kuitpo Gala in the Exhibition Building
proved a great success. Outstanding features
were the decorations of the stage, supervised
by Mrs. Frank Harcus, and the frocking of
the five queens and the retinues, designed and
carried out by Mesdames H. B. W. Wynyard
and Compton Trew. The queen competition
brought in £1743 11s. 6d. Just before the gala
there was a morning tea at the Town Hall, and
the five queens handed the cheques they had
won to the representatives of several charities.
Mayoress Glover entertained 200 guests in her
reception-room at the Town Hall, which was
decked with gladioli, antirrhinums and roses, all
in pink tones. Mrs. Glover was gowned in
black lace with bands of cire ribbon introduced,
and her wide-brimmed black straw hat was
wreathed with pink roses. The Mayor thanked
those who had assisted Mrs. Glover on her
many committees during her term of office.
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Sneyd have sold their
beautiful home Avondale, at Medindie, origin-
ally built by the Rutter Clarkes. They will
move out next month. As a farewell to the
place, Mrs. Sneyd entertained at bridge smartly
gowned in autumn tones. The drawing-room
was fragrant with pink roses, and crimson roses
decorated the tea-table in the dining-room.
Social annals of the Speck:
Perfect weather blessed the race meeting at
Elwick, and the drought which menaces us
wasn’t allowed to show its nose in the lawns
and flower-beds. Chairman J. T. Weaver and
his wife dispensed tea and smiles in the pavilion,
where pansies and Iceland poppies made
splashes of color on the tables. The Governor
and Lady Clark were there, she in navy blue,
with a hat in blue and petunia shades. Summer
frocks had an outing for once in a way, and
looked very gay and pretty. Punters included
Col. and Mrs. Whitham, Col. and Mrs. D.
Young, the A. J. Millers, Dr. and Mrs. Fay,
the C. H. Ikins, the T H. Heys, Dr. and
Mrs. A. E. Rogers, the W. B. Propstings, the
Huon Walkers, Mrs. W. Wolfhagen, the V. R.
Rattens, Dr. and Mrs. Brettingham-Moore, the
Norman Atkinses, Mrs. Russell Ibbott and a
few early swallows from the mainland.
His Ex. and Lady Clark motored to Devon-
port to shed the light of their countenances on
the Show. Lady Clark opened the Women’s
Industries section. Their Exes, attended a civic
reception and ball at Ulverstone, and the
Devonport Victoria League seized the chance
of welcoming Lady Clark.
Many pre-wedding parties were given in
honor of Edna Gorringe, now Mrs. Owen
Burrows. Young hostesses included Jean and
Pauline Beauchamp, Kathleen and Beth St.
Hill, Betty Morriss and Nancy Bidencope. The
wedding was at St. David’s Cathedral, where
Bishop Snowdon Hay tied the knot. The bride’s
frock of heavy old-ivory satin had a cowl neck-
line and a veil of silk tulle caught at the
back of the head with orange-blossom. The
bridegroom’s sister Iris ’maided alone in a
smart turnout of powder-blue sand crepe, and a
big picture hat.
The Grey girls, Alison and Helen, are home
after a long trip to N.S.W. Mrs. Grey staged
a welcome-home party for them the day of their
arrival. The house was ablaze with flowers, tea-
tables being done up in mauve, pink and cerise
blooms.
The George Arthurs, after many years in
N. S. Wales, have returned to settle at Entally,
Hadspen.

Dan and Uncle.
BY STEELE RUDD.
THE road Dan and Uncle took when
they left Ruddville with their swags
up, having fallen out with Dad,
wasn’t the road to Rome, but it would
take them to the railway station, or right
across Australia if they followed it long
enough. They followed it stubbornly
for half a day; then, coming to a shady
tree by the way, they rested under it and
talked of Dad. Apd while they talked
Dan smoked and Uncle, removing one of
his boots, shook the grit out of it.
“He hasn’t much sense after all,” Dan
said, “or he’d kept us till he got th’ wheat
safe in th’ bags before flyin’ off th’
handle and bellerin’ at us to get from th’
place and clear to Hell, like he did!”
“Did you say much sense?” Uncle
smiled. “Murty never had any sense.”
“He’s makin’ money now, though, th’
old dog,” Dan went on disrespectfully —
“or others are makin’ it for him.”
“You said right when you said others
—and I was one who med a lot of it for
him.” Uncle spoke as if he was in pain,
and, shoving his boot aside, left his bare
foot out to be fanned by the cool breeze.
“More than hundreds I med for him if
the truth were to be knowed.”
Taking his pipe from his mouth Dan
eyed Uncle amusedly.
“And when we get to the Never-Never
I’ll go into the contracts you have out
there, and I’ll make more fer you, Dan,
than I did fer him.”
“Contracts ?” Dan had almost for-
gotten the fictitious prospects he had
built up for himself. Quickly remem-
bering, he said “Yairs, oh yairs,” and
went on smoking again.
“What did you tell me the contracts
were fer?” Uncle asked in his gentle
way after a silence. “I did remember,
but failin’ out with Murty put everythin’
out o’ me head.”
What he had told Uncle about
his “contracts” Dan had quite forgotten.
But he had been in awkward corners
before. Dan resorted to strategy. He
became an alarmist.
Taking the pipe from his mouth again,
and eyeing the grass around, he said:
“There’s a bulldog ants’ nest about
here, I reckon.”
But just then Uncle wasn’t interested
in ants’ nests of any kind. He was think-
ing deeply of the future.
“ Well-borin’, I think you said one
was?” he reminded Dan.
“Yairs,” the other confirmed.
“Or was it bridge-buildin’?”
“Both,” Dan further confirmed.
“And what did you say was th’ name
of your partner? I forgot it too?”
“Eh?” Dan sparred. “Oh yairs—
Kelly. Paddy Kelly.”
“I don’t think it were Kelly!” Uncle
was puzzled.
But Dan wasn’t. Stretching his long
legs out and propping his body up on one
elbow, he brightened up.
“Now listen to me, Uncle, me boy,” he
said in a confident voice, “and tell me
what you think of this new idea I’ve got.
Instead of going to the railway, as we
first decided we would, and getting our
tickets for the Never-Never —or me get-
ting them, for you’ve only got the ten
bob in silver the old Mater gave y’ when
we were cornin’ away—suppose we keep
th’ money, and work for th’ cockies round
here for a while instead; then work our
way down th’ rivers into Noo South?
“We’ll collect our payrolls at this place
an’ that, move from one job to another,
put up here an’ there, meet fresh pals an’
see noo life. We’ll go to the talkies and
ih’ circuses at th’ townships—laughin’ at
the Old Man, when we think of him, for
bein’ a fool an’ orderin’ us off. Then
we’ll end up at Sydney for th’ Show,
an’ go to the races at Ran’wick, an’ stop
at a topnotch boardin’-house, an’ come
back by steamer, an’ call on th’ Old
Man? How will that suit y’, eh?”
Uncle, who had also stretched himself
out as well as he could, sat up and looked
dejectedly at Dan. Uncle never displayed
much signs of enthusiasm; he always
looked a man of sorrow, whether ac-
quainted with grief or not.
“Of course” —Dan sat up —“you won’t
have, to do any work. That’ll be left to
me. Your job’ll be th’ cookin’ when
we’re not found in tucker by th’ cockies
and have to pitch our tent. As for
money, of course I’ll make enough of
that to do th’ two of us and more”
While Dan talked Uncle’s twinkling
eyes rested on him. Dan’s own eyes,
brown and dull, rested vaguely on a
bulldog ant hurdling its way over blades
of dry grass, twigs and other obstacles
and making menacingly for Uncle’s bare
foot. Dan’s mind, though, was not on
the ant.
“An’ mentionin’ money,” he went on,
seeing that Uncle remained silent, “are y’
sure you haven’t lost that ten bob the
Mater gave you?”
Uncle gave a start but, after feverishly
searching his pockets, produced the coins.
“That’s all right,” Dan said placidly,
“because I might have to draw on y’ for
some change. I got nothing on me but
big stuff” —striking his empty pocket—
“till we get to some place where there’s
a bank, an’ I can break it.”
“You must have a lot o’ big stuff on
y’, Dan,” Uncle smiled. But Dan didn’t
see the joke. Dan never did see any of
Uncle’s jokes.
“But if we change our minds now,”
Uncle said wistfully, “an’ go down the
rivers, how will your contracts get on?”
“Contracts ?” And Dan for the moment
looked as if he thought Uncle had said
debts or wives. “Oh yairs”—recovering
himself —“they’ll be all right; Curby’ll
see they’re carried on accordin’ to tender
till I”
“Curby ? You mean Kelly, don’t y’?”
from Uncle.
But Dan’s eyes now fortunately rested
full on the bulldog ant.
“Look out,” he warned loudly, “that
cow’ll go for you!”
Thinking a horned bovine of some
kind was about to make an attack on
him Uncle looked round. Simultaneously,
the bulldog ant fastened itself on his
big toe. Uncle gave out a yell, and tried
to jump to his feet. His agility wasn’t
equal to it. He fell across the form of
Dan, kicking frantically. The bulldog
ant retained its grip.
“Here, get off!” Dan protested, shov-
ing Uncle from him ; “don’t be bellerin’
in a man’s ear!”
Uncle, rolling on his back, cried: “Take
it off me! Is it a adder?”
“Yah! Keep still!” Dan commanded,
seizing hold of the other’s bare foot with
one hand and calmly disabling the bull-
dog with finger and thumb. “Adder!
—if it were it’d be th’ last kick you'd
give!”
Uncle sighed in relief. But Dan sud-
denly put fresh fear into him.
“Look out!” he warned again, “put
your boot on! There’s a hole dang
army of them cornin’ at you!” And,
reaching for his swag, he jumped up.
Uncle lost no time in obeying. With
the boot in one hand and his swag in
the other, he hopped off to fresh shelter.
Dan remained to study the enemy.
“Them’s th’ reinforcements cornin’ up,”
he said in admiration. “Look at th’ little
cows! Full o’ fight! And blood in their
eyes” . , '
But Uncle had had enough. Scanning
the spot closely before putting his swag
down again, he. sat in the shade of an-
other tree, pulling his boot on and cough-
ing and moaning.
“But only one o’ them bit y’,” Dan
discounted, joining him again and drop-
ping in the shade beside him. “What
would y’ have to say if a whole dang
regiment o’ them got up th’ legs of your
pants, same as they did to me on th’
Culgoa once when I had a broken leg,
and a swarm o’ bees settled on me at th’
same time, stingin’ me all over like hell?”
Uncle gave him a sickly look, and
took another fit of coughing. •
“And when th’ bees were stingin’ me,”
Dan went on, “I couldn’t feel th’ bites
of th’ bulldogs ; and when th’ bulldogs
were at me I couldn’t feel the stings of
th’ dam’ bees”——
Uncle ceased coughing and, turning a
sickly look on Dan, again broke into a
chuckle. He was chuckling when a
freckled-faced boy from a farmstead
near by, wearing a drooping felt hat and
patched pants and no boots, approached
and greeted them with a grin.
Dan asked him who he was. Uncle
stared vacantly at him. But the youth
had a message.
“Me mother says if y’ want harvestin’
to do,” he said, blinking a pair of large,
round, blue eyes at them as if for amuse-
ment, “would yous come to-morrer ah
help with our wheat?
“Would yous?” he repeated when
neither answered promptly.
“Well, he might.” And Uncle looked
at Dan.
“Who’s yer mother?” Dan asked.
“She’s me mother, o’ course,” and the
youth grinned curiously at him.
“ ’E means what’s ’er name?” Uncle
prompted. “Mrs. somethin’, isn’t it?”
“No—Mrs. Carter,” the boy corrected,
“an’ I’m Tom Carter.”

CRAIG & AITKEN, 654 George Street, Sydney.
“An’ she’ll start harvestin’ to-morrow?”
Dan mused. “Puttin’ men on?”
The youth nodded in the affirmative.
Dan sat up. “An’ at how much a day?”
The boy didn’t know. But he knew
that “Mister Stooks was cornin’ himself
to cut it with his noo machine.”
Dan thought hard.
“Will yous come?” Tom blinked hope-
fully. “Me mother wants to know.”.
“Mrs. Carter,” Uncle mumbled, speak-
ing partly to himself. “I heard them
talkin’ of her at Ruddville. She’s a
widder.”
“There’s no harm in goin’ to see her
about it,” Dan decided.
“And makin’ it th’ startin’ point for
workin’ our way down th’ rivers, as
you decided,” from Uncle.
“Come on, I’ll take yous to our place” ;
and, skipping off, Tom led the way.
Conducting them to the front door of
the little farm-home, with its neat garden
and peach- and apricot-trees in full fruit
surrounding it, the boy slipped inside and
brought out his mother. A compact,
cheerful little woman was Mrs. Carter,
bright-eyed, loquacious, but businesslike,
and short-sleeved and brown-armed.
“I saw you two men,” she began apolo-
getically, “when I was over at the mail-
box, and I thought perhaps you were
looking for harvesting; that was why I
sent my son to ask.” As she spoke her
eye rested on the form of Uncle, and
she stopped abruptly. “But you can’t
be wanting harvesting,” she said in sur-
prise ; “you are Mister Uncle to the
Rudds, aren’t you?”
“I knew it was him, mother,” Tom,
full of enthusiasm, put in beside her;
“I knew as soon as I seen him.”
Mrs. Carter, like others in the adjoin-
ing districts, had known, or known of,
Uncle for years. Uncle himself had no
idea that he was a celebrity. Dan,
though, was a stranger to her and Tom.
Uncle admitted his identity and, turn-
ing to Dan with the pride of relation-
ship glinting in his eye, added: “You
don’t know who this is, I suppose?”
She shook her head. But before he
could enlighten her Dan, who was a
master of strategy, threw off his swag
from his shoulder so suddenly that it
collided with Uncle and almost knocked
him off his legs.
Tom, boy-like, burst into mirth, and
while his mother turned to remonstrate
with him Dan winked and frowned
meaningly on Uncle. Uncle, understand-
ing, remained silent, looking penitent.
“So if you would care to take a few
days’ harvesting,” Mrs. Carter went
on, addressing Dan, “we’ll be starting
the reaper and binder to-morrow. Mr.
Stooks will be working the machine, and
one other man besides ourselves will be
enough, I think.”
“Very well, missus,” Dan complied
airily. “But I’m not looking for work
meself, as far as that goes. I’m making
for th’ Diamantina, where I got a place
of me own, and I’m taking the old chap
here”—nodding towards Uncle —“out
with me to fix him up there for a year or
two for the good of his health. And
perhaps”—as an afterthought—“l might
take him from here to Sydney for a trip
before goin’ to the Diamantina.”
“Oh, you are good to him!” said the
widow.
“So I’ll give you the couple of days,”
Dan added lightly, “before gettin’ on
th’ train. Th’ money I s’pose will be th’
same as what’s generally given at harvest-
lirne? I mention it only as business, y’
know, for I believe in keepin’ strict to
business.”
Mrs. Carter approved of Dan’s atti-
tude. She believed in doing everything
in a business way herself—it prevented
misunderstandings—and said the money
would be six shillings a day and keep.
“That’s what most harvest hands are
getting in the district,” she explained,
“though there are plenty of men satis-
fied with five shillings a day.”
“S’pose so ; but they’re only new at
the game, missus.” Dan shook his head.
“An’ they’ll be coves who are always
ready to be in th’ shade when they’re
not watched. An’ have to be pulled out
of bed every morning” Dan laughed
huskily.
“You are not far wrong about the
pulling out of their beds,” she admitted,
“but they are mostly very old hands at
the game, I think.”
“Well, you won’t find me one of their
sort,” Dan, giving himself a jaunty shake,
claimed. “An’ if I can’t do twice as
much work as any two of ’em can do
in a day—well, I’ll eat the end out of
me swag.”
Tom laughed merrily again. Tom was
beginning to admire Dan.
“Well, now,” the widow said, chang-
ing the subject and turning to the door,
“we are just sitting down to dinner, the
children and myself. And I’m sure you
men must be hungry. Tom will show
you where to put your belongings.”
“We’ve struck it all right, Uncle, boy,”
“be th’ look o’ things,” Dan said when
they had put their swags away and were
washing their hands at the tank. “Though
I never thought I’d fall to workin’ for
a woman-boss —p’tic’ly a widder.”
“If I remember right,” Uncle remin-
isced as he wiped his hands and gazed at
himself in a soapy hand-mirror, “he left
her pretty comfortable, Carter did.”
Then inside they went.
Mrs. Carter, seated at the head of the
table, was already serving out.
“Take those two chairs,” she said
cheerfully, “and you can both sit to-
gether. It’s not a big meal we have at
midday, but make the most of it.”
“For what we are about to receive,
Lord, make us truly thankful,” came
solemnly from Tom on the opposite side
of the visitors.
“Amen,” added his mother.
“Hamen,” said Uncle meekly.
Dan gave a start and looked at Uncle.
“Make the most of everything and be
at home,” came from the hostess again.
And Dan, commencing first, made the
most of everything.
Dan never spared himself at mealtime.
But Uncle merely nibbled. Uncle was
an epicure. What food didn’t start him
coughing gave him indigestion or didn’t
agree with him in some other way. He
was a willing tea-drinker, though, and
while he drank he talked.
“Fancy you leaving the district to go
away out west, Mr. Rudd,” said the
widow. “Your name is Rudd? You are
not Mrs. Rudd’s brother?”
“It’s Rudd,” Uncle endorsed humbly.
“I’m Murty’s brother, an’ I’m younger
than him be ten years.”
“Oh, goodness!” And she eyed Uncle
curiously as he lowered his head to his
plate and showed a large bald crown.
“ ‘Old Dad’ everyone calls him,” Tom
put in. “An’ I know Joe Rudd. He stut-
ters. An’ Dave Rudd. He always sez
‘eripes.’ ”
“Ton seem to know the whole family,
Tom,” from his mother proudly.
“And I know Sarah,” Myra, Tom’s
sister, two years his senior, said from the
end of the table. “She’s lovely.”
“I like Joe th’ best,” Tom, helping
himself to jam, grinned.
“But isn’t there a boy—he’s a man
now —who is always away?” Mrs. Carter
questioned of Dap. “Comes home some-
times at Christmas with only a concer-
tina which he plays all day long in the
barn, and sometimes in the paddock.”
Dan stared. Tom and Myra broke
into mirth.
“They say he won’t work,” Mrs. Carter
said, “which is so unlike his father.”
Uncle took a fit of coughing and low-
ered his head.
“Yes, I know,” and Tom held up his
fork. “Joe Rudd told me he tells lies.
He told them once how he fought all
th’ wild blacks hisself! Ha!” Tom
laughed again.
Dan looked round at the door.
Uncle coughed so hard that he upset
his tea over the clean white cloth.
“Oh, my!” Myra gasped. But her
mother, to help Uncle, made light of it
and, rising smilingly, mopped up the mess.
But Dan’s features never changed;
and when the widow again spoke to him
of harvesting on the morrow he merely
answered with a “yairs” and “I s’pect
so.” Dan after that was not himself at
all. But soon as the meal was over and
he and Uncle were outside together he
went sour.
“I don’t know what y’ saw to laugh
at!” he said. “An’ I’ve a good mind to
go back to Ruddville an’ break that
young Joe’s darn neck for talkin’ about
me
“It don’t matter,” Uncle wheezed.
“It matters that much that we’re off,”
Dan decided. “I don t want to take wages
from a widder, anyway. An’ I can’t
afford to harvest for ’er for nothin’. So
let’s have that loose silver y’ got, an’ I’ll
go in an’ pay for what we’ve had, an’
tell her we decided not to stop.”
Uncle, looking disappointed, produced
the silver, and Dan, shaking his whiskers,
went off in search of Mrs. Carter.
Half an hour passed, and Uncle, wait-
ing at the barn, was becoming impatient.
“Did you see anything of my—my
friend?” he cautiously asked of Tom,
who came along collecting eggs.
“He’s talkin’ to mother,” was the
answer.
Next moment Dan, with a smile that
rustled his whiskers, returned.
“It’s all right, Uncle, boy,” he said. “I
hadn’t th’ heart to turn th’ little woman
down. I’m goin’ to see th’ harvest
through—and . you’re goin’ into th’
kitchen!”

The Curse of the Earlams.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
DR. EGAN conveyed an impression of
exasperation as he removed his
stethoscope and placed it on his
desk, signalling to Arthur Earlam to put
on his clothes.
“You’re killing yourself,” he said
angrily. “There’s nothing wrong with
you, and yet there’s everything wrong
with you. What you are suffering from,
really, is self-hypnotism.”
Arthur Earlam, having put on his coat,
let himself fall into the lounge-chair with
an air of extreme lassitude, and smiled
wanly.
“It’s the curse of the Earlams,” he said.
“Damn the curse of the Earlams! It
wouldn’t matter tuppence if you hadn’t
let it soak into your mind.”
Earlam drew himself out of the chair
wearily, walked to a desk, as if the exer-
tion was a drain on his energy, and
brought from it a leather-bound folio,
which he threw on the table as he fell
languidly once more into his seat. His
action had turned back the leather coyer,
revealing a handwritten title-page bearing
the words “The History of the Curse of
the Earlams” in the pointed caligraphy
affected by women of the Victorian era.
“It’s all in there, explain the mystery
as you will. Generation after generation
no new Earlam has been born into the
world but his father died just before.”
“I know. You’ve shown me that
already. I’d like to burn the damn
thing,” said the doctor irritably. “What
made your grandmother Write up the
wretched business?”
“I suppose she felt proud of belonging
to a family that had owned a real live
curse for hundreds of years,” said Ear-
lam with a bitter laugh. “You can’t deny
the existence of the curse, if you read that
history.
“My father did not marry until
he was 64. He died two days before I
was born. My grandfather died a week
before my father was born. His father
had brought his bride to Australia, try-
ing to avoid a curse, already long estab-
lished, by a change of climate. They
were here for five years before my grand-
father was born; but when my grand-
father did make his appearance his father
was dead. My grandfather’s grandfather,
again, was one of twins, also born after
the death of their father. The other twin
had an affair with a servant girl, his
mother’s maid; she gave birth to a child
three days after the father died; and
my great-great-grandfather died before
the birth of my great-grandfather. The
chain is pretty complete.”
“It’s the most ridiculous nonsense I
ever heard,” Dr. Egan said. “A chain
of superstition, carried on from genera-
tion to generation.”
“It’s a poetical idea in a way. The
child can only be born by the father sac-
rificing his own life. Perhaps his per-
sonality is required to be passed on in
the new life. I feel as if I have in my
brain vague memories of events that
happened centuries ago.”
“In fact, you feel that you are really
an Earlam who helped to chop off the
head of Charles the First, or tried to
prevent it. It’s all morbid bunkum, Ear-
lam. You’ve saturated yourself in the
superstition as, very likely, all your fore-
bears did. If you were so impressed by
the idiotic legend, why the blazes did you
and Mrs. Earlam think of having a
child?”
“Before Mary and I married I ex-
plained the position. We told ourselves
we would do without children ; but as
time went on I felt that she longed for a
baby. I had the same longing, too. We
finally decided to defy the curse.”
He made a pathetically weak gesture
with his arms. “You see it is too strong
for us. I’ll be dead before the child is
born.”
“You won’t if you throw off your
rotten delusions. Don’t you see how
unfair it is to Mrs. Earlam? You are
going to leave her with the feeling that
she is almost a murderer —a husband-
slayer. Instead of the prospect of the
baby’s birth being a joy to her, it is
hell to contemplate! Do you know that
she suggested an operation to me?”
“An operation!” exclaimed Earlam.
“To save you. I refused, of course —
it would be murder. It isn’t necessary,
anyhow. Good God, man, you’ve got a
brain, haven’t you? You’re something
better than a damned abo. who’s had a
bone pointed at him!”
“You must admit that the curse is a
mystery.”
“That’s the hell of it all—you’re proud
of it!” The doctor seized the folio from
the table. “You’d better let me tear this
rotten thing to smithereens.”
Earlam, with a start of energy, took it
L from his hands. The doctor stared at
him and, crossing the room, shook his
fist at an enlarged portrait on the wall
the picture of an elderly woman, capped.
“You don’t seem to have any great
fancy for grandma.”
“Why should she write a beastly thing
like that? I knew the lady better than
you did, Arthur, and yet I daresay you
didn’t care for her.”
“I was afraid of her ; but she was a
great old girl. Lived to be over ninety;
and look at the women’s movements she
led, even when she was old!”
“Led? Was, you mean. She insisted on
being the whole thing or nothing. One
of those domineering females. You were
only a boy when she died.”
“Ten years old.”
“Yes ; 1 knew grandma. A woman
of iron—and rusted! But I never hated
her until I knew your case and found
she’d written that thing. It was fasten-
ing the shackles of a stupid legend on her
descendants. You’ve got to forget it,
Arthur.... For the wife’s sake!”
As Egan passed out into the hall, a
woman rushed forward eagerly to meet
him. The question she wanted to ask
was in her face, in her whole bearing.
“There’s nothing wrong with him,
Mary,” said Egan, affecting a boisterous-
ness of manner. “He’s suffering from
superstition, that’s all. Laugh him out
of it!”
“Can he be laughed out of it?” she
questioned eagerly. “He will live —there
is no danger, is there, doctor?”
Egan scarcely knew the answer he shot
at her ; he meant it to be reassuring. But
he cursed under his breath.
He had known Earlam from his
infancy ; known him for a clean and like-
able young man, touched by an effem-
inacy for which the history of the family
—a long line in which the successive sons
had never experienced the guardianship
of a father —was responsible. It was
exasperating to think that he could do
nothing to save this fine young man—
and the wife who would suffer, too.
Earlam was wasting from a sickness for
which all his medical science could find
no cure.
And Mary must have the feeling that
she was carrying within herself her
husband’s death-warrant.
Mary had never been unduly im-
pressed by the family history of which
Arthur had told her. She had regarded
his belief in such a bogey as a curious
freak ; but in her affection for him had
respected it. When he had apparently
abandoned the superstition she had been
glad, as one who hails the recovery of a
loved being from a distressing malady.
The discovery that it still lingered and
was likely to have terrible results horri-
fied her. Her natural desires, satisfied,
would mean the death of her husband.
But she conquered her tears. The only
way to meet the threatening disaster, to
triumph over the supernatural tragedy
that was looming over the house, was to
remain cheerful, to laugh away, with
practical commonsense, the ghosts of the
past that had taken possession of her
husband’s soul; to dismiss them as folly.
“Mrs. Chartres is calling for me,
Arthur,” she said. “You know what a
goose Mrs. Chartres is! She’s found
a new fortune-teller —Mrs. Chartres be-
lieves in all that silly nonsense —and she
wants me to go along with her.”
“Pooh! —fortune-tellers!” said Arthur.
“I thought it would be a bit of fun,”
said Mary. “Will you come along with
us? I’d like to hear if she says anything
about the curse of the Earlams. I bet
she prophesies that you live to be a hun-
dred —and probably a nice wife for you
next year!”
“I won’t go, dear,” Earlam said. “But
you go if it’ll amuse you.”
The fortune-teller, discovered in a
shabby, semi-detached cottage in a
shabby suburb, proved a bore. Mary
could not even gain amusement from the
eager faith with which Mrs. Chartres,
giving at least half the information that
was handed back to her, gulped in the
prophecies of the greasily impressive and
“aitch”-less palmist.
“There’s a shadder broodin’ over yer,”
said the palmist as Mary took her turn.
“That’s the curse of the Earlams,”
said Mary to Mrs. Chartres, filling in a
careless remark in sheer boredom.
“You’re Mrs. Earlam” Mary
could have laughed at the cheap obvious-
ness of it; the mark of the wedding-ring,
though Mrs. Chartres had induced her to
remove it, was on her finger. “The baby
you are to have will be a fine child —a
boy. Some trouble threatens your
’usband. But I can see money”

“That’ll be my rents. Darcy, my col-
lector, always brings the money along
on Mondays ; Arthur has it paid in for
me next day.”
She was glad when it was all over ;
glad, too, when she had got rid of Mrs.
Chartres and could go home, feeling tired
and miserable. Her husband was killing
himself with a superstition, and she had
missed another of the decreasing days
of his companionship without doing
anything to help him.
The burglary was a clumsy one. Arthur
Earlam, wakened by the sounds of furtive
movement, was out in an instant. Re-
volver in hand, he stood in the doorway
as he switched the light on.
The burglar turned round with a gasp
and stared at him standing there. With-
out a command his hands went up in
token of surrender; Earlam was too
astonished, as he stared at the face of
the intruder, to give any command.
Mary, disturbed for her husband in
his weak condition, had leapt from bed
as he moved, had tried to persuade him
not to face the unknown danger. Still
more concerned about the effect of shock
upon his health than for any other con-
sideration, she had rung up Dr. Egan
instead of the police. Egan had had Ear-
lam on his mind all the evening ; in no
time he was at the Earlam home.
A disturbed, half-dressed servant let
him in, and in the hall Mary came to
meet him and wordlessly led him into
a lighted room. He paused, nonplussed.
For a moment he thought that the fur-
tive-looking man in the far corner of
the room was Earlam himself, strangely
aged, bloated curiously and dressed
shabbily; but from where he sat,
screened by the chair in which he was
sitting, Earlam thrust out his head, look-
ing back at him.
“Ah, Egan!” he greeted. “Look what
we’ve got here.”
The shabbily-dressed man leapt from
his seat.
“Mister!” he appealed. “You tole me
you wasn’t goin’ to call no perlice.”
“This isn’t a policeman, Honeysett,”
said Earlam cheerfully. “This is Dr.
Egan. Doctor, I want you to meet my
friend —my burglar, I might call him.
He broke in here to-night, and when I
bailed him up he had a nice tale to tell
me about being sooled on to the job
by his mother. Mother tells fortunes,
and gathered from my wife, who went
to her with Mrs. Chartres, that there’d
be some loose cash in the house to-night.
It seems my friend here has never been
a burglar before —he’s anything but an
expert. Doesn’t look like an expert, does
he? But what does he look like?”
It was a queer group, there at that
hour —the invalid Earlam, showing more
animation than he had displayed for
months, enjoying the situation appa-
rently. as he lolled in his chair in his
pyjamas; Mrs. Earlam, in a kimono,
standing anxiously near him ; the doctor,
with tousled hair and a glimpse of
pyjamas showing through the opened
breast of his overcoat; the half-dressed
servant, gape-mouthed in the back-
ground ; and, before them all, the
alarmed and protesting intruder in his
shabby clothes, elderly and uncouth, and
yet
“What does he look like?” said Dr.
Egan, taking up Earlam’s question.
“Why, damn it all, he looks like you”
“That’s the sweet part of the joke!
From what I have gathered from our
friend, his mother told him he was safe
in burglaring here because his father was
my father. Though the Law wouldn’t
recognise it, he’s my half-brother !”
“I ain’t persoomin’ on no relation-
ship,” put in the man who looked so
like an older and debauched edition of
Earlam. “Me mother says ole Mr.
Earlam treated ’er ’andsome, an’ she
kept ’er word to ’im never ter say no-
thin’. But there’s me been outer work
these six munce, an’ me mother, pore
soul, takin’ ter forchune-tellin’ ter try
an’ ’elp, an’ the idea came to ’er when
th’ lydy there, she called an’ mentioned
some money in the ’ouse. There’s me
missus an’ the kids”
“Kids?” cried Earlam, springing to his
feet. “How many children have you?”
“Four of ’em, all ’elpless. An’ look,
mister, whatcher goin’ to do?” whined
the intruder.
“Do?” cried Arthur. “I’m goin’ to
give you a fiver to go on with, an’ get
you a job. Jane, take this gentleman
down to the kitchen and give him some-
thing to eat. Then make him a parcel of
food to take home.”
His whole aspect was one of animation
as he turned on Egan when, spluttering
amazed thanks, the burglar followed the
half-dressed servant from the room.
“A lot of men would only be horrified
to discover a half-brother like that. He’s
an Earlam —there’s no doubting that.
And see what it means to me! Long
before I was born my father had a son
—and lived for twenty-five years after it!
And that son has four children and is still
alive. That finishes the curse of the
Earlams! ”
“By Jove!” exclaimed Egan, feeling
that a key to a problem had been thrust
into his hand. “I see the whole business
now! I told you what a domineering
woman your grandmother was ; how she
took your father about with her, chained
to her chariot-wheels. She was determined
that she would allow no woman to share
her son’s affections ; she used to preach
fiercely, too, that a man’s conduct should
be as chaste as a woman’s. She worked
up the curse of the Earlams to help her ;
obviously—though she probably thought
he did —your father didn’t believe in it
much, and his death was by accident,
anyway, even if it was a coincidence.
The curse of the Earlams is probably a
fake from beginning to end.”
“You can’t say that,” said Arthur
stiffly.
Egan laughed boisterously at him, see-
ing that he resented the complete de-
struction of a family tradition, just as
he might have resented a declaration that
some old art treasure, prized as a family
heirloom, was bogus.
“I don’t care whether I can or not.
What’s happened has done what medi-
cine never could have done. Look at
you now —a dying man yesterday, it
seemed ; as sprightly as a chicken now! ”
“It means a lot to me,” laughed
Earlam.
“Oh, damn you, Earlam! ” cried Egan.
“I’m thinking of what it means to her.'”
Arthur turned swiftly to Mary at this
reminder, his arms held out to her. The
look of strain she had tried hard to con-
ceal had vanished.
“Arthur! Oh, how glad I am!” she
cried.
As he took her in his arms he heard
the door click as it shut. Dr. Egan, as
satisfied as they were, was departing in
search of his disturbed sleep.
Mr, MihellicK’s Relativity.
BY GEOFFREY CUMINE.
MR. PERCIVAL MIHELLICK had
an almost exhaustive knowledge of
the more intimate articles of ladies’
wardrobes. He could look back upon
an unbroken association of over thirty
years with one of our great softgoods
houses.
For the rest, he was an exemplary
husband, childless, and with perhaps a
shade less than a controlling interest in
his suburban home. There his blameless
hobbies comprised highly theoretical —
and moderately successful—horticulture
and the absorption of partially pre-
digested culture from various periodicals
which cater for Mihellicks the world
over.
Mihellicks go through life with a
species of philosophic myopia. Mr.
Mihellick’s life, indeed, was still divided
very much on the lines of the original
slogan for Eight-Hour Day, and the in-
terests of one division were never
allowed to slop, or even to seep, into
those adjoining. He had been requested
to consent to two reductions of salary,
and was wont to express himself with
clarity and vigor on the subject of taxes ;
but he took comfort from the fact that he
owned an unencumbered dwelling and,
despite the falling-off of business, was
in no danger of losing the comfortable
position which thirty years’ intensive
study of “undies” had hewn out for him.
Many of Mr. Mihellick’s ideas were
a little blurred in outline. Thus, to him,
the mention of Freud called up the word
complexes,” and with “complexes” Mr.
Mihellick had been known to make great
play in railway-carriages. Similarly,
whilst he, in common with the rest of
us, had never succeeded in getting the
Theory of Relativity anchored down, as
it were, he had a certain conception that
it involved the idea of Time considered
as a flexible medium, so that two events
apparently widely separated might, in
some mysterious fashion, actually ocCur
simultaneously. In the heady brew were
also, of course, infusions of dreams and
sex.

All this, however, is merely back-
ground, and it is high time that we
focussed upon the crumpled rose-leaf, to
use a simile lifted straight from his be-
loved hobby, which marred Mr. Mihel-
lick’s otherwise tranquil existence. This
was the persistently unneighborly con-
duct of his neighbor Cadbury —a man
soured by a lifetime riddled with idiotic
allusions to cocoa by all with whom he
came in contact. Cadbury represented
some whisky or other, so that the asso-
ciation seemed more than ever ill-
timed.
As might be expected, it was the fate of
the inoffensive Mr. Mihellick to deliver
himself of a jeu-d’esprit based on this
fanciful connection, and that very soon
after Cadbury had moved into the cottage
next door, after foreclosing on a mort-
gage. The passage of years had done
little to heal the breach. Each expected
nothing of the other but civility—and
very little of that.
It is possible that, had the necessity
arisen for one gentleman to request from
the other the loan of his lawnmower or
some lesser item of gardening parapher-
nalia, the armed neutrality might have
merged into a rapprochement and ulti-
mately an entente cordiale. Such was
not to be, for both were zealous in
the tilling of their soils and the pruning
of their shrubs and standard roses and,
as a natural corollary, in adding to their
already ample store of implements for
every conceivable purpose connected
with suburban husbandry. Indeed, in
the meticulous care of their domains,
there was little to choose between
Laburnam (Mihellick) and The Moor-
ings (Cadbury).
Matters were in this state when Mr.
Mihellick had his dream for the first
time. He mentioned it to Mrs. Mihel-
lick at the breakfast-table. The dream
may as well be related here as anywhere
else in this tale, for, though it recurred
on numerous occasions, the details, as
Mr. Mihellick averred, never varied in
the slightest particular.
Mr. Mihellick had been using a spade,
and had leant it against the fence while
he stooped to pay a domiciliary visit to
a family of snails. Attracted by some
slight sound through the fence —a low
affair of wire, with a hedge of golden-
privet—he looked upward. His gaze
rested upon the bald spot at the
top of Mr. Cadbury’s head as that gentle-
man leant backwards to survey the gut-
tering of his dwelling. Stealthily Mr.
Mihellick stretched out his hand for the
spade. Silently he rose' to his feet.
Swiftly he brought the spade down upon
the defenceless head of Cadbury —and
awoke.
Even as Mr. Mihellick reached this
grisly conclusion of his account of the
dream, Mr. Cadbury was observed from
the breakfast-room window on his way
to the station as usual. There was, then,
no occasion for anxiety on the part of
Mrs. Mihellick. The mild nightmare
had faded in the recollection of both
Mihellicks when Mr. Mihellick confessed
to a repetition of the disagreeable
vision.
There followed a further period of un-
disturbed nights spent in refreshing slum-
ber. When the dream manifested itself
for the third time, identical in its
photographic clarity with the two pre-
vious visitations, Mr. Mihellick decided
that something ought to be done about
it.
His indiscriminate selection of snip-
pets of knowledge had richly manured
the fallow soil of his mind, which now
carried a rank crop of confused and
tangled theories. From these white
sprouts of darkness he selected one which
proved, on inspection, to be a dangerous
growth of psycho-analysis—dangerous,
that is, in ordinary hands, though pos-
sessing certain medicinal qualities when
taken in minute doses. Counting this an
omen, he made it his business to consult
a psychiatrist, who assured him, for two
guineas, that there was really nothing
to be alarmed about, though he would
be well-advised to place himself in the
hands of his usual medical adviser for
a general physical overhaul, since, more
than likely, the undue stimulation of the
imaginative faculty proceeded from a
condition of slight general debility, or
words to that effect.
Mr. Mihellick accordingly consulted Dr.
Blair, the local medico, who advised him
to take things easy, slow up on the gar-
dening stuff and drink plenty of milk.
Two portions of this advice were com-
paratively easy to follow, but the neglect
of his beloved garden was more than
Mr. Mihellick could manage, though he
struggled manfully. Good Dr. Blair had,
no doubt, realised that, if he ordered his
patient to leave the garden absolutely
alone, the irritation caused by such a
ban would outweigh all benefits which
might be gained from the other items
of his prescribed regime. But, as it was,
one might just as well have advised an
inebriate to limit himself to a couple of
drinks a day.
Mr. Mihellick’s dream persisted. Some-
times weeks would elapse without its
manifestation. Sometimes it would occur
on two consecutive nights. Mr. Mihellick
became quite habituated to it, but the
horror of its repetition was merely trans-
ferred in an intensified form to his wak-
ing moments, for these became a verit-
able jungle overgrown with the most dis-
tressing theories, which sprang ever be-
fore his feet and buffeted his poor be-
wildered mind. Of these terrors he said
nothing to Mrs. Mihellick. They were
his special garden of misery in which
he seemed doomed to spend his life in
endless struggles with the writhing
weeds.
From time to time he consulted Dr.
Blair*—a good chap, but so matter-of-
fact. A man couldn’t very well blurt
out such a string of nonsense as seemed
waiting to burst from Mr. Mihellick’s lips.
Cadbury worked in his garden as usual
and was seen daily on his way to the
station with the inevitable attache-case.
There were times in this period when
Mr. Mihellick felt almost friendly towards
Cadbury. He was almost minded to
attempt some effort towards cordiality.
Perhaps if he could tell Cadbury, who
probably wasn’t really such a bad chap
after all, the whole absurd story he
would feel better and the dreams would
leave him alone. But he might meet
only with some contemptuous rebuff.
It couldn’t be done.
At the warehouse, strangely enough,
things were not so bad. No doubt his
habit of dividing his time into hermeti-
cally sealed compartments stood him in
good stead and enabled him to concen-
trate upon the frilly trifles which gave
him bread. Certainly nobody with whom
he came in contact in the course
of business noticed anything untoward
in his appearance or demeanor. It was
the time spent in journeying between the
city and Laburnam and the evening
hours that were the worst. Once he was
asleep, he knew what to expect. But it
was the apparent inevitability of the
dreams, rather than any innate horror
therein, which was now his overmastering
concern.
Mrs. Mihellick has testified that, dur-
ing this period, he seemed a little moody
and depressed, but this she attributed to
the difficult times through which his firm,
in common with others, was passing. Dr.
Blair has stated that his physical con-
dition, as observed over a series of visits,
was such as to be expected of one ex-
posed to business worries and of com-
paratively sedentary habits. Cadbury
had nothing to communicate.
We come now to the evening when
Mr. Mihellick visited Dr. Blair for the
last time. We have the interview ver-
batim, according to the best of the
doctor’s recollection, which was pro-
bably excellent. Mr. Mihellick appeared
to be in excellent spirits, better spirits
indeed than he was accustomed to ex-
hibit. Quite cheerful, in fact. He said
that he was satisfied that Einstein was
right, and that, though the same event
might seem to occur repeatedly, there
was, in actuality, but one occurrence.
The doctor confessed that this statement
seemed obscure and slightly confused,
but then he was no close student of
modern thought in the realm of physics,
and all discussions on such matters
sounded much alike to him.
The doctor went on to say that Mihel-
lick referred to the sale-of-work which
was being conducted that afternoon,
mentioning that every lady in the place
seemed to be attending it. This remark
struck the doctor as inconsequent. The
fact, in any case, was within his know-
ledge, Mrs. Blair having proclaimed her
own intention to attend the function.
Mihellick then announced that he had
settled the matter of his recurring dream
once and for all.
During the absence of their wives, Cad-
bury and he had occupied themselves in
their gardens. Mihellick had determined
to straighten the edge of a diamond-
shaped parterre and had provided him-
self with a spade from the toolhouse
for the purpose. After completing this
small task, he decided to make sure that
he had got rid of the snails from the
border which ran along the fence. He
rested the spade against the fence, or
hedge. He chanced to look upward and
noticed Cadbury staring at the eaves of
his own house. He reached for the spade.
At this point, said Dr. Blair, an inter-
ruption was caused by the prolonged
ringing of the hall-door bell. The con-
stable was admitted. Mihellick, who
seemed mildly elated, greeted him
civilly . ~..,

CHILDREN
Are Often the
Victims of Worms.
A child who is affected with Threa
Worms will often appear to tjie eye to 1
in an indifferent state of health. It b
comes peevish and irritable in its tempe
Another point to which the attention
mothers should be specially directed
that the child is apt to start in its sleej
its repose being in the way of a disturbe
nature.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail t
recognise the fact that their little ones ar
suffering intense pain and distress, and ar
practically irresponsible for the outburst
of temper, restlessness and peevishness
and until some more serious symptom
appear nothing is done to alleviate th
distress. The symptoms of this disease ar
somewhat variable, but generally they ar
so characteristic that no mother need havt
any doubt. The best proof of worms i
worms, and if the general conduct of th*
child is such as to give the slightest sus
picion, a careful watch will give ample
proof.
Worms, by their movement and the in
terruption they offer to the contents o:
the bowels, generally occasion pain o
uneasiness in the abdomen, sometime
spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and bit
ing, and not infrequently of a vague
indescribable character, and yet very dis
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the nostrils, pro-
ducing a disposition to pick the nose
which is characteristic of the affection
The bowels are often disordered, some-
times relaxed, as in dysentery. The
appetite is exceedingly variable ; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infre-
quently alternating with another. The
abdomen is often hard, swollen and tym-
panetic, the breath heavy or foetid, and
tongue furred, with disagreeable taste,
and a copious flow of saliva ; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils,
and disposition to grind the teeth during
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the alimentary canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among
the most common of these are nervous
affections, such as fretfulness, irritation
of temper, wakefulness, or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sud-
den starting out of sleep as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the
eyelids, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion compounded on a scientific principle
for the eradication of both Stomach and
Thread Worms. They contain specific
properties which destroy the worms but
cause no injury to the stomach or bowels,
and do not weaken the system. The
pellets are prepared in the form of a
confection, or lolly, have no disagree-
able taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they
would an ordinary sweet.
