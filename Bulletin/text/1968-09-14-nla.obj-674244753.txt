THE TIMES ATLAS OF THE WORLD
COMPR
If it’s a question of what or where in the world,
here is the final authority
The unique
World Atlas of
The London Times
From the Times of London comes the Times World Atlas,
just published. The most complete, accurate and exhaustively
researched World Atlas ever printed. A unique publication.
Every city, town and province in the
world is here. Over 200,000 place names,
all listed in a Gazetteer two hundred and
sixty pages long, with twice as many refer-
ences as any other Atlas —and superbly
illustrated in two hundred and forty pages
of maps in full colour; the most detailed
and accurate maps ever published in an
Atlas. For example, maps detailing the
Soviet Union occupy 20 full pages, Aus-
tralia 6 pages and North America 38 pages.
You’ll find every global statistic in
the Times Atlas. The world's daily food
consumption, nuclear energy production,
composition of the earth's atmosphere,
weather patterns, population density,
ocean currents, world communications.
All in the London Times World Atlas.
This latest edition of the Times Atlas
(the fourth in eighty years) also brings you
a complete study of the Moon and man's
knowledge to date of our only satellite, and
how satellites are increasing that know-
ledge. You'll also find articles on our solar
system and galaxy, plus two pages of mag-
nificently printed star maps in colour.

In short, the Atlas of the London Times presents our world
and its features in more detail, more accurately than any
similar publication to date. This is the reason why earlier
editions have long been standard cartographic reference in
public libraries and research institutions throughout the world.
In Australia, this Atlas has been approved by State Govern-
ments for school library subsidy.
There are only limited copies of the Times World Atlas avail-
able; to ensure your own personal copy, post the coupon
below as soon as possible. A publication of this quality is
always in demand. Elaborately bound in specially manufac-
tured heavy library cloth, with two hundred and forty pages
of maps in full colour and 300 pages of information and
statistics, the World Atlas of the London Times is available
at just $29.50 cash. And, for such a unique work, this price
is unbeatable. (In England, this Atlas will sell for $33.88.)

“AANA WAS FOUNDED in 1928,
a time when Henry Lawson was writ-
ing his way into Australian History,”
says the prospectus for the Australian
Association of National Advertisers’
1968 convention. In 1928 poor Henry
was six years dead.
GETTING THE SCORE
IN HAVING a second look at the
recent Sydney SRC survey of student
attitudes, as well as noticing that the
compilers had got so excited over the
answers to the question “Are you a
virgin?” (Yes, 55.4 percent; No, 37.6
percent; Informal, 14.5 percent) that
the answers totalled 107.5 percent in-
stead of 100 percent, we also noticed
the strangeness of the answers to the
question “If there were a Child Mind-
ing Centre in this University now,
would you use it?” The “yes” answer
was 12.9 percent. Since all of the
8.3 percent of students who said they
were married probably do not have
children, we were left with the im-
pression that either there is a high
illegitimacy rate at Sydney University
or that some of the students wanted
to use the Child Minding Centre for
themselves.
LAST CURTAIN
SYDNEY may at last know when it
will have an opera house and how
much it will cost. It also has to face
the fact that within six months it will,
on present plans, be worse off for
theatre buildings than, in all probability,
it has been since the last century.
The Tivoli is to be demolished to
rise again as part of an extensive build-
ing complex in 1972 or 1973, the Old
Tote is to be demolished, with the
company going into temporary premises
until a new theatre is built, probably
by 1971, and the Palace is to disappear
for ever. There is also the prospect of
the Royal disappearing in 18 months or
so.
Lend Lease Investment last week
secured acceptance by the City Com-
missioners of their tender for the Hotel
Sydney-Tivoli site. Rebuilding on this
site has been a case of try, try, try
again, but present prospects seem
brighter. The old Tivoli, at present
housing Barry Humphries, will be
replaced by a 1300-seat theatre some-
where in the new complex of office
blocks and car parks.
On present plans, the ramshackle
Old Tote Theatre, within the grounds
of the University of New South Wales,
will come down early next year. The
company will then move into one of the
temporary buildings on the west side of
Anzac Parade which were the original
home of the university. This building
has been converted to a theatre and
will serve for the following 18 months
or so.
The company hopes to return to a
new Old Tote Theatre on the site of the
present building in 1970 or 1971. Pro-
fessor Robert Quentin, head of the
Drama Department of the university,
said last week that enough finance had
been secured to build, and architects
had been appointed. It will be a timber
building. The theatre currently has an
appeal for $400,000 in progress, and
will still thankfully accept any help.
But these firm plans seem to rule out
the possibility of the Old Tote company
forming the basis of a national theatre
company to be based in the Opera
House, although, of course, it does not
rule out the hope of the Old Tote
people co-operating to get something in
the nature of drama going at Bennelong
Point.
Press photographs of Mr. Eric Duck-
worth, of the Phillip Theatre, and Miss
Rosemary Martin and Mr. Stuart Wag-
staff, at present appearing at the Palace
Theatre in a Noel Coward season, form-
ing a deputation to plead with the City
Commissioners for the preservation of
the Palace from the hands of the wicked
developers seemed to suggest an oppor-
tunity for publicity seized rather than
burning concern.
Mr. Duckworth isn’t very sanguine
about the Palace’s prospects. What
he would like is the sort of victory that
the battlers- for the St. James Theatre
in London had a few years ago: now in
London a theatre can’t be pulled down
unless it is replaced. Obviously, de-
velopers must try to get the best return
from expensive city land, but, equally
obviously, development should not price
parks, churches, theatres out of the
city area. The London idea seems as
good as any to make sure they are not.
If it is too late for the Palace, what
about applying this condition to the
Royal?
MORE BY DESIGN
THE PHRASE “good design” has
always had a somewhat abstract ring
Harry Sebel ... bigger awards
to it, so rarely are the functional and
the attractive combined.
Ugly television sets are the .rule rather
than the exception, and it seems that
household ware has to be expensive to
look good.
But people are beginning to care. The
Industrial Design Council tries and,
last year, Harry Sebel, a furniture manu-
facturer, established the Sebel Design
Award, offering a total of $lOOO in
prizemoney. The award is made every
two years, and entries are now being
accepted for the second one, which
closes in February and for which prize-
money has been doubled. First prize
alone is worth $lOOO this time.
Yet, designers and manufacturers
seem only moderately enthusiastic about
the award. Sebel says: “There seems to
be some misunderstanding by designers,
who feel they’re far too busy to make
up a special design as an entry. Design
groups and company designers are wel-
come to put in entries of products that
are already in production, as long as

So far, about 40 designers have sub-
mitted entry forms on which they’ve
listed objects as diverse as jewellery,
bus seats, garden and office furniture,
toiletry dispensers, toys, glassware, elec-
trical equipment, boats, cameras, and
cardboard furniture. Last year’s winner,
Jerry Arnott, took out the award with
a movie camera he’d designed for
Hanimex.
Several of the other designers were
given commissions by manufacturers
who saw their names and designs in the
catalogue Sebel publishes after the
award.
Sebel,' who began his career as an
engineer and draughtsman, originated
the award because of his own problems
in finding good designs for his factory.
He commissioned three of the designers
who entered last year’s competition to
work on projects for this company.
TIMELESS
“TIME” MAGAZINE started a new
advertising campaign in America last
week with full-page ads all over the
country featuring the covers of what
it sees as some of its world com-
petitors: “Semana,” “Jeune Afrique,”
“Time and Tide,” “Vita,” “Elseviers,”
“L’Express,” “Newsweek,” “Confir-
mado”—and The Bulletin. The copy
began: “Forty-five years ago there was
only one weekly news magazine. Now
there are dozens.” Not quite so. Eighty-
eight years ago there was The Bulletin,
and that was before Henry Luce was
born. For that matter, 125 years ago
there was “The Economist,” which, in
the international market of news maga-
zines, is probably the best in the world.
SALES
MARKETING HABITS are hard to
kick: at the Communist Party’s Mel-
bourne protest meeting against the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia the
bookstall was, as usual, complete with
Lenin’s “On the Unity of the Com-
munist Parties” and the glossy paean
to all things Russian, the magazine
“Soviet Union.”
SNOW MOAN
THE NICEST skiing holiday is one
spent in a village in the snow that has
a really away-from-it-all atmosphere.
This is why Lend Lease Corporation,
which runs the Thredbo resort, with
its living quarters well below the snow-
line, is now to build another village
high up in the snow for those who
prefer to step outside their door into
snow instead of mud.
This could provide some competition
for the nearby resort run by
Publishers’ Holdings in the Perisher
Valley. Here the main attraction is
also the major drawback: to get in or
out of the valley involves travelling
about 1J miles in snow vehicles over
a road that the Kosciusko Park Trust
have absurdly decided not to keep
clear of snow. You pay $3.50 for a
return ticket, or more than $1 a mile
for a bumpy, uncomfortable, crowded
ride. And because everyone wants to
go in or come out of the valley at
the end of the week when their holi-
days begin or end the situation on
Saturdays is generally chaotic.
The one- or two-hour waits in good
weather for a vehicle to turn up can
double or treble in bad weather. Then
there is a good chance of getting
dumped off with all your luggage in
the snow, hundreds of yards from your
destination, because drivers fear the
risk of their vehicles breaking down on
hills.
The present system is a fair-weather
one, and even then it is far from good.
And the chaos extends farther down
the line. The car park is ten miles from
the terminal for over-snow transport,
and the return bus fare is $l5. But
when the road is icy this service breaks
down, too. Ansett’s, who have the exclu-
sive franchise for transport, say they
are doing their best to keep up a service
and deny that the operation is highly
profitable. The system is simply no
good.
Yet the answer is simple. If the road

THE GOLDEN PROMISE
OF THE
GREAT SOUTHLAND
ULTIMATELY, there is an extraord-
inary similarity between Communist and
capitalist societies. In Russia the State
owns everything. It provides the com-
munes, the big stores, the creches for
the children so that the mothers can
go to work, the theatres: it is the great
father protector of all humans.
In the capitalist society, Myer’s owns
everything. Myer’s provides the com-
munes, the big stores, the creches for
the children so that the mothers can
go to work, the theatres: it is the great
father protector of all humans.
There is even a religious quality
about it. When Myer’s established
Chadstone, it bought its 30 acres from
the Convent of the Good Shepherd.
When it established Southland, it
bought the 30 acres from the Hos-
pitaller Brothers of St. John of God.
So Chadstone and Southland are virtu-
ally on hallowed ground.
This is the Myer score to date: Chad-
stone, 1960, $l2 million, Northland,
1966, $lB million, Eastland, 1967, $l3
million, and Southland, 1968, $2O
million. There is talk already of West-
land being under way and then, no
doubt, there will be a Nor’ Nor’ East-
land, a West Sou’ Westland, and so on.
Can you imagine the newspaper acreage
of supplements, the daily drop-ins of
advertisements to cope with the East-
lands, Northlands, and Southlands,
names undoubtedly inspired by Walt
Disney and his Disneyland, Adventure-
land, Tomorrowland, and Fantasyland.
The Myer’s buyer now is an immense
figure, capable of making or breaking
large manufacturers.
Myer’s has six regional shopping
cities in Australia four around Mel-
bourne, Miranda Fair in New South
Wales, Chermside in Queensland.
Southland is the grandest of them all
and it was opened just last week. It is
on the Pt. Nepean Highway, 11 miles
from the city, and it has a car park for
2400 cars. The centre itself is in the
new style, all enclosed. That is, the
customers never breathe anything but
pure regulated air at the right tempera-
ture, the light filters down at the correct
intensity from up above, and the
shoppers are put in the right buying
frame of mind by piped music. The
floor is all terrazzo, very clean like a
bathroom floor, and the inside is
superb, almost like the Melbourne
Shrine. It is on three levels with a
central skylight. The main feature
rising up through the balconies is a
60ft. copper fountain. It is like a Nor-
folk Island pine, with copper leaves
sticking out like Woolworths trays, and
the water drops down from leaf to
leaf.
The rooftop is rather charming.
Here there are trees and shrubs, acres
of instant grass, plus a winding creek
crossed by little Japanese bridges.
George Tsindos has a bistro there,
both inside and outside. The outside
section is surrounded by big glass
panels to keep out the wind, so that
one sits there happily like a fish in an
aquarium.
Opening day was frightening. The
doors did not open until 9.05 a.m., but
the mob began to arrive at 7.30. By
8.30 all the parking space was gone,
and at nine they were surging, fighting
to be first in for the opening-day
specials. Between 125,000 and 150,000
went through during the day, shedding
even more litter than they dropped at
“You can say we have no territorial
claims at present!”
the opening of the Arts Centre. Indeed,
the number of soft-drink cartons that
were dropped into the fountain and
the rooftop creek was a distinct chal-
lenge to the number of bottles, meat-
pie containers, and ice-cream cones
that were dropped into the Arts Centre
moat.
There was garbage all over the
terrazzo floor, in every pool, and on
each leaf of the copper fountain. The
instant grass on the roof was trampled
almost black and in the first few hours
three tons of garbage went to the incin-
erator.
Of course, school holidays gave a

nice impetus to everything. The

One escalator carried so many that it
had to be reversed to stop it from

Your correspondent rested his weary
feet in the doughnut shop, where he
had a cup of coffee. On the wall in
ceramic tile was the inscription: “As
you ramble through life, brother, what-
ever be your goal: keep your eye upon
the doughnut, not upon the hole.”
Unquestionably, this is the Myer
motto: they keep the corporate eye
securely upon the doughnut.
Actually, the way Myer’s choose the
right spot for one of their communes is
a fascinating exercise. Southland was a
classic situation, absolutely right. It
was estimated that there were 141,000
people within three miles, 258,000
within the trading area. The experts
worked out that total spending for the
area would be $145,800,000 in 1970,
and $17,500,000 of that would be spent
at Southland. There were 83,000 homes
and 82,000 cars 20 percent above
average ownership level in the metro-
politan area. And, as they say in the
advertising agencies in St. Kilda Road,
the area had the right growth potential.
Furthermore, Southland has been
opened at just the right time. Myer’s
were equally clever with Northland.
Curiosity trade will keep the crowds
at a high level right until November,
and then it will coast beautifully into
Christmas.
There was a solemn coincidence in
the opening day. Almost exactly 53
years earlier, on September 12, 1915,
the troopship Southland, with the 21st
Battalion aboard and a company of
the 23rd, was torpedoed on its way
to Gallipoli. Thirty-two Australians,
including Colonel Richard Linton, com-
mander of the 6th Brigade, lost their
lives. The Southland, 14ft. down at the
bows, eventually got into Lemnos.
Now that omen might not be so
fearful except that the Southland was
torpedoed again, this time off the coast
of Ireland on June 4, 1917, and this
time it really did go down.
But somehow the Myer Southland
will survive. It is an awfully tough
doughnut.

advertising executives who’s got abso-
lutely the most definite views on love
and sex is draped round a microphone
and saying he’s ready to blitz the minds
of all these retailers who have travelled
from Newcastle, Wollongong, and Grace
Bros., Bondi Junction, right there in
their seats and really make them feel
young. The retailers allow fragile smiles
on to their sophisticated faces; after all,
they’ve seen it all. Be warned, folks, the
guys and gals from Levi’s Australia are
going to put on a 35-minute commercial
that is going to knock your eyes out.
Pow! Kerzam! Ber-litz!
And up in the control box some
eejit presses the wrong button and
what was intended as a lion-size attack
on the senses comes out as a little ol’
mousy whisper. Ted Madox-Brown,
who’s directing this $6OOO production,
a nice round figure which includes food
and drink for 350 guests, Ted, up in
the production box, passes a shaking
hand over his forehead and shouts turn
it up. Oh, boy, have they had troubles
with this show, which is a kind of copy
of a happening at Expo 67, in Montreal.
An admixture of visual/sound/move-
ment is Ted’s description, which means
six films going all at once and dance
routines shoved in between. Anyway,
he first imports some American to pro-
duce it, a wise-guy who knows it all,
and doesn’t. Then they lose the lead
male dancer, Ronne Arnold, so they
start all over again with 14 days in
hand and the choreography to rewrite.
His wife, Margot, is here tonight in a
go-green dress and feeling, to be quite
honest, stop-red. Well, she was on the
job at 7.30 a.m. In the corner, he’s
terribly nervous, says Margot, stands
25-year-old New Yorker David Field,
Levi’s general manager in Australia. He
is saying he has been to 52 countries
and just loves Australia, in fact, he is
terribly tempted to become a citizen.
Depending on well, how shall he put
it —■' how things go. With jeans, he
means. He hopes they go from a present
20 percent of the market to 50 percent.
And, careful how this is worded, his
jeans have even found their way into
Robina Beard and Noel Brophy...
“Hi-ya!”
Russia, where they go for $5O a pair on
the black market.
Actually, Mr. Field doesn’t believe
in formal cocktail parties and name-
tags on lapels, he likes fun-times like
tonight. Anyone can come to his office
and re-lax, he says, meaning not his pre-
vious office in Australia Square, gee
those Lend Lease guys were tough, but
his new one in Penfold House. Where
everything is beautiful. His staff zoom
around on a little Honda motor-bike.
Mr. Field zooms around on his big
Honda motor-bike, colored red-candy-
apple, which he drove here tonight. He
believes in mobility.
So all Mr. Field’s people are here,
with little buttons stuck in their ties
which read Levi-Strauss S.F. Cal.,
relaxing like crazy.
And after the show the retailers eat
hamburgers and quaff the hard, and it
is possible to see how avant-garde they
are in Newcastle, Wollongong, and the
Bondi Junction branch of Grace Bros.
Not a pair of Grizzly Spun, shrunk-to-
fit, super-slim jeans among them. A
couple of broad-beamed girls have, with
difficulty, poured themselves into
Woven Twills.
“Well,” says dancer Robina Beard,
spinning from the kitchen in an elastic-
topped orange dress, “am I glad that’s
over. My legs gave way, you know, I
had a funny feeling that told me to
sit.” Miss Beard recognises this funny
feeling now after 23 years of dancing.
Everyone’s coming up to actor Noel
Brophy and saying hi-ya, Noel. Hi-ya,
he replies. He doesn’t know who on
earth they are. Who, for instance, is
that man from 2CH who says he’s
going through a baked-beans phase and
enjoying it? Lack of work gives him
time to think about the future. And that
fellah in grey, should he know him?
That is Ted Madox-Brown, his host.
Mr. Brophy says of course he wears
jeans, everyone does. Not ABC’s Ellis

CAPTAIN COOK
TAKES A
CAPTAIN COOK
IT WAS an imaginative idea to invite
Captain Cook to Sydney to discuss
plans for celebrating the 200th anni-
versary of his discovery of the region.
After the official reception, the great
but irascible navigator was taken to the
office of Mr. Norm Brite, of Brite and
Associates, who are involved in the
bicentenary promotion.
“I suppose you’ve noticed some
changes since you were here before,
Captain,” said Mr. Brite.
“Yes, although I did not come pre-
cisely to this spot,” replied Cook. “I
observed an inlet three leagues to the
northward of Botany Bay, but did not
feel it necessary to land there. The
settlers here appear to be industrious,
and I am pleased to note their pros-
perity.”
“I assure you, Captain, we feel it
an honor to have you with us,” said
Mr. Brite. “It is also a pleasant sur-
prise, as we did not quite expect you
would be able to make it. This bicen-
tenary is going to be a big show. The
name of Cook stands second to none in
Australia’s history. Already the after-
noon papers have given a thorough
coverage to your career.”
“That is gratifying,” said Cook.
“When I sailed along the eastern coast
of this continent, I did not commem-
orate my name by attaching it to
natural features, being disposed to
accord that distinction to members of
His Majesty’s Government and certain
naval colleagues. I have since regretted
this a little, from, a perhaps pardonable
vanity. From your statement that my
name is held in esteem, may I con-
clude that it has been conferred upon
some important settlement?”
“Well —er —yes, sir, there is Cook-
town, in Queensland.”
“And what is the magnitude of the
population of Cooktown?”
“I believe there are about 400 people
there. It’s not overcrowded. But it’s
quite a charming little place.”
“Hmm,” replied Cook. “I presume
some conspicuous geographical feature
has been named after me a mountain
range or river, for example?”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Brite. “There’s —•
let me see, there is Cook’s River, right
here in Sydney!”
“Would you be good enough to indi-
cate it to me on a chart?”
Mr. Brite unfolded a map of Sydney
and suburbs.
“There it is, Captain,” he said
nervously.
“So that is Cook’s River,” said the
visitor. “I remember it. A tidal creek
some ten miles long running into Bot-
any Bay. I confess I hoped for some-
thing better, Mr. Brite.”
“Cook’s River has been improved,
Captain,” said Mr. Brite. “There are
some nice parks around it. You don’t
often see dead cats or mattresses in it
now.”
“Do you mean to inform me,” said
Cook coldly, “that in the State of New
South Wales, to which I gave its name,
I have been memorialised only by this
drab and exiguous watercourse?”
“Oh, no, sir! There’s a big Captain
Cook Dock and three Captain Cook
Hotels. And some Cook Streets, too.”
“Pray show me the Cook Streets.”
Mr. Brite produced “Gregory’s Street
Directory” and the Captain examined
it briefly.
“These Cook Streets appear to be
situated in suburban districts,” he said.
“Is there any principal thoroughfare
of the city bearing my name?”
“I’m afraid not, Captain. You see —”
Cook was turning the pages of the
street directory.
“What’s this?” he exclaimed. “Fif-
teen Banks Streets and 13 Banksia
Streets! That humbug gave me enough
trouble in his lifetime. And now he has
had his name preserved by attaching
it to one of his damned plants!”
Captain Cook stood up.
“Mr. Brite,” he said, “I shall speak
plainly. Although you say my name is
esteemed here, it has not been conferred
on any feature of consequence, with
the possible exception of a dock. A
hamlet in Queensland, a creek in Syd-
ney, a few pubs and back streets I
accept your assurance that you mean
to commemorate my discoveries, but
feel compelled to add that it is about
time.”
Mr. Brite, white-faced, followed him
to the door and called out: “I forgot
the Cooka Burger Fish Shop in Pad-
dington!”
But the immortal seaman had gone.

WELL, WHAT ARE WE MISSING?
Comment by‘Observer’
YOU just can’t tell what might come
out of the campaign New South Wales
Premier Askin has now started against
the Federal Government. Nothing much
at all, perhaps. Or perhaps the begin-
ning of reform of the Commonwealth’s
financial relationship with the States.
What a boring way to put it “the
Commomvealth’s financial relationship
with the States.” This is merely the
nothing phrase.of a politician, a vague,
general phrase rationalising political
self-importance and self-interest. What
should interest the people of Australia
is not some question of the relations
of one lot of politicians in Canberra
with six other lots of politicians in
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth, and Hobart, but the question of
the standard of the Australian schools
and universities, hospitals, transport
systems, and of those cities in which
most Australians spend their lives.
What is happening for the moment
is that because the Commonwealth
gathers in the taxes and hands out
revenue to the States it can slow down
the extent to which there is a rise
in the revenue for education, health
services, transport, and improvement in
city life. In other words, Australia’s
general rise in prosperity each year is
higher than the rise of activity in some
of the services that most matter to
Australians. The Commonwealth tries
to get away with this trick because it
is not directly responsible to voters for
the administration of these services. It
pockets the money it saves, which it
can then use to its own political ad-
vantage. It can waste some of it, for
example, on flashy schemes of so-called
“national development” that are
economically unsound but go well in
speeches; or for vote-getting reasons
it can waste money on various kinds of
subsidy schemes to farmers, propping
up inefficient industries or industries
with declining markets that should be
encouraged to go out of business (and
thereby perhaps directing resources
from those highly efficient farming in-
dustries that should be expanding be-
cause they have markets for their pro-
ducts, not to mention starving the
cities of that development money that
it is in Australia’s overall interest they
should have).
Politics being what it is, most of the
debate on these matters is carried on
in terms that are not directly relevant
to the issues in expressions of per-
sonal like or dislike, in the favoritism
of political deals, in ideological debate
about “centralism” and “State rights.”
After the Premiers meet next month at
Mr. Askin’s invitation, will they find
some new way of giving the people of
Australia the idea that what matters
most about the present policy is not
talk about “State” and “Federal” but
talk about the quantity and quality of
schools, universities, hospitals, transport
systems, and urban improvement?
Take education. There is a very good
case for believing that the elitism of
our education system should be de-
stroyed, yet this cannot be done without
a great deal of extra money. Apart
from quality, there is a question of
quantity. Yet it is extremely doubtful
that, even merely for economic reasons,
we can afford not to spend this money.
It is a great deal more important
to the . economic future of Australia
that all Australians should receive a full
secondary education and that many
more should receive some kind of
tertiary education than that dairy-
farmers should be encouraged to stay
in business. The reason is plain enough.
For its success, the technological society
of the future demands an educated and
adaptable workforce and the techno-
crats themselves should be highly
educated. This is not just a matter of
manufacturing things and selling them
in the shops. As society moves out of
its purely industrial stage (in which
production was the main problem) the
technological approach can be trans-
ferred to other aspects of life, and can
be made a way of trying to carry out
ideals that until recently seemed im-
possible to fulfil.
There are other reasons for destroy-
ing the present system in which
secondary schools are tyrannised by the
selection problems of the universities
and universities exist on a built-in
failure rate. Of these the most obvious
is that it would be good if, through
an education relevant to their interests
and talents, more Australians were
given an opportunity to more fully
develop their potential.
Broadening education in this way
will not be possible without money. If
the Commonwealth sits on our money
nothing can be done. This means that,
in objective terms, it is the policy of
the Commonwealth Government to
hold back from Australians of mediocre
talent in, or with little interest in, the
present range of academic subjects the
opportunity to enjoy an education
fitted to their talents or their interests.
Where the State Governments weaken
their case is that none of them pro-
claims that it has a revolutionary
policy for broadening the education
system and destroying its elitism. If
the State Governments put up such
policies their case would be much
stronger. They could then say to the
people: look, because of the Common-
wealth, this is what you are missing.
The same goes for the hospitals, trans-
port systems, and urban improvement.
Perhaps policies should precede every-
thing else.
MORE TROUBLE AHEAD FOR McEWEN
Comment by Alan Reid
ALREADY “copping” the blame for
the Government’s wheat-stabilisation
scheme, the Country Party looks as
though it is now going to run into
trouble with primary producers over
Cabinet’s decision to negotiate for a
partnership with the British-owned Port
Line at a cost of between $3O and $4O
million.
The decision is basically the brain
child of Country Party Leader and
Minister for Trade John McEwen. But
the negotiations, if successful, will put
the Government into the cellular-
container-vessel trade, which, according
to a confidential report from a high-
powered committee set up by the
Graziers’ Association of N.S.W., would
be gravely to the disadvantage of the
wool industry, still the largest item of
export in the trades served by the
United Kingdom-Continental shipping
conference.
The report, signed, among others, by
Mr. D. G. F. Mackay, who was him-
self a noise in the shipping trade and
had links with P & O before he turned
grazier, is quite an impressive docu-
ment.
Though the signatories are all private-
enterprise men, the report is realistic
rather than ideological. On the subject
of Government entry into the shipping-
field, through the Government-owned
Australian National Line it is open-
minded. “The Commonwealth Govern-
ment should give serious consideration
to approving the entry of an Australian-
owned line or lines into trade, in addi-
tion to the Australia-Japan trade, which
the Australian National Line has been
given permission to enter, if the lines
so permitted are satisfied they can
operate profitably. The committee is
unable to publish confidential informa-
tion it has received about the likely
success of an Australian line entering
the other overseas trades. It can say
in the light of this information that it
is not convinced about the validity of
the argument against Australian flag
operations in overseas trades. The
U.K./Continental/Australia trade is
served by a closed conference . . . the
most significant disadvantage is the
absence of price and service competi-
tion and the creation of near-monopoly
power in the hands of a group of ship-
owners.”
Interesting, politically, is the vein of

It’s so tiny.
For one thing it loads instantly. Instead
of all that fussy film threading and reel
changing there’s the new super 8 film

There s no winding to slow things up.
Battery power drives the film.
Then there’s the matter of size. These
cameras are so tiny they fit in the palm

is what you see on your screen. New

sharper than old-type movies.

Camera (above) at $56.50, has a built-in
electric eye which does all the thinking
for you. We have other models, too,
from as low as $39.50. And since super 8
movies call for a super 8 projector,
Kodak offers you a wide choice there,

resentment running through the report
about the secrecy and dominance in
this field of McEwen’s Trade Depart-
ment —a criticism that has now been
pointed up by the fact that nothing is
known about the Government’s plans
to try to negotiate a partnership with
the Port Line beyond the fact that the
partnership could cost the Australian
taxpayer up to $4O million.
Dealing with the method of chang-
ing rates downward or upward, the
report says: “At no stage are the actual
costs of each shipping line in each link
of the operation disclosed. Nor, with
the general figures of cost provided,
can they be analysed sufficiently to
permit the Federal Exporters’ Overseas
Transport Committee to determine the
level of efficiency or otherwise of each
respective operation. In the committee’s
opinion one of the weaknesses of the
system is that it benefits the efficient
shipowners to have inefficient shippers'
in the conference. There is no way at
present of assessing, on the basis of
the figures available, the efficiency of
individual cargo-shipping lines. The
rate of freight, and charges thereof, are
determined on a basis which includes
the operating costs of the least efficient
member of the conference. This does
not necessarily guarantee a profit to
all members of the conference, but it
does ensure at least the more inefficient
members are not losing as much as
would be the case if pure competition
existed.”
But it is on the subject of cellular
shipping that the seeds of direct con-
flict between primary producers and
McEwen, as head of the Country Party,
can be expected. Though details of the
Government’s plans have been kept
very much under wraps, a partnership
with the Port Line would also put the
Government into Associated Container
Transportation Ltd. Members are Cun-
ard, with its Port Line subsidiary, the
Blue Star Line (Vestey’s), and Eller-
man, Ben and Harrison Lines. This
group intends to commence a cellular-
container ship operation on the U.K./
Australia run in 1969.
States the report: “The committee
has closely examined the merits and
demerits of the cellular-container and
unit-load methods (for wool), and the
balance of advantages appears to lie,
at this stage, with the unit-load vessel.
One thing is clear: the success of
cellular-container cargo vessels on the
U.K./Australia trade particularly, and
in other trades probably, depends
very much on the cellular-container
companies being able to obtain a
greater part, if not all, of the wool
shipped to the U.K. and other destina-
tions ... if a monopoly or near-
monopoly situation arises, and cellular-
cargo shipping operators and co-operat-
ing enterprises are running at continual
losses, the result within the existing
conferences and formula framework
will be high rates of freight.”
It looks as though there could be
trouble ahead for the Country Party
over shipping as well as wheat.


Everyone's up in armchairs...
It's an attractive Cause!
As soon as people hear about the BOAC Armchair,
they tend to get excited.
The most comfortable economy class seat in the
world . . . masses more legroom . . . deep, comfort-
able contours, smothered in soft upholstery. That’s
the kind of thing that attracts an army of armchair
partisans.
And creates some side benefits. Because these days
the company up in the Armchairs is fun—not to
mention varied. Beards and blondes, financiers and
farmers. All because BOAC went to so much trouble
with the seat. Contoured it so it fits everyone—
nobody has to fit it.
BOAC have 10 Armchair flights a week out of
Australia to London and Europe. Seven .a week West
via India, three a week East via the U.S.A.
So see your BOAC Travel Agent, BOAC, or Qantas,
General Sales Agents for BOAC.
When you book, tell them the Armchair’s the cause.
And you're joining it.

The
coming
revolt of
the States
AUSTRALIA
WHEN PRIME MINISTER
Gorton had finished his tours
of the U.S.A. and South-East
Asia this year, they were
saying in N.S.W’s Liberal-
Country Party Government
that it was about time he
made a tour of the Austra-
lian States. However, when
he was touring two of the
States (and the Northern
Territory) last week on his
“development” tour, they
were saying it was about time he came
to Sydney.
They didn’t mean a weekend at Kir-
ribilli House, or opening a debs’ ball.
They meant it was time that Mr. Gor-
ton understood how dissatisfied the
N.S.W. Government was with his atti-
tude to the States in general and to
N.S.W. in particular.
Still smarting from Mr. Gorton’s
sharpness at the Premiers’ Conference
in June, and faced with making ends
meet in his forthcoming Budget, N.S.W.
Premier Robin Askin raised the stan-
dards of revolt in two camps. In the
camp of the Government Parties he
had his members writing to their
Federal members asking them to define
their positions and there were threats
of State Liberal-Country Party sabotage
of a Federal election. In the camp of
the State Premiers, Mr. Askin found,
perhaps to his surprise, that all the State
Premiers had agreed to accept his invi-
tation to a Premiers’ conference next
month, at which there will be no Prime
Minister.
Meanwhile, in Canberra in Mr. Gor-
ton’s absence, they were recalling that
one of the axioms of politics is that you
shouldn’t concentrate so much on your
enemies that you forget your friends.
That, right now, appeared to be some-
thing which Mr. Gorton needed to
ponder.
Not only were his most weighty critics
in the field of defence and foreign
affairs not his opponents in the Labor
Party but friends upon whom he
depends (a significant number of
Liberals, the DLP, and several senior
Cabinet colleagues); his weighty critics
on domestic finance were now the
Liberal State Premiers. Askin in N.S.W.,
Bolte in Victoria, Bjelke-Petersen in
Queensland, and Hall in South Aus-
tralia were far more of a threat right
Premier Askin .. . raising the standard of revolt
now than anything which the Labor
Opposition could muster, since, racked
by internal conflicts perhaps more
severe than ever before, it can show
little political initiative of its own at
present.
Going out to dish the Labor Party,
Mr. Gorton produced a “Welfare
Budget” last month that provided the
biggest increases in the bill for social
welfare payments in the nation’s history.
And he has promised more. He has Mr.
Wentworth, his Social Services Minis-
ter, turning the Department of Social
Services upside down in an effort to
produce new ideas. He has committees
looking for new policies for health. By
this, Mr. Gorton is hoping to make
credible the claim that Labor has no
monopoly of concern for the underdog.
But in working to undermine the
political base of the official Labor
Opposition, he appears to have neglected
to secure his own position. To find the
money for social welfare in the Budget,
he applied the brakes to the States.
It may be that the States have com-
plained so regularly about the deal they
are getting, that the impact of their
criticism will be muffled. Perhaps they
have cried “wolf” at the Commonwealth
so often that the citizenry will take a
lot of stirring. But the Premiers have a
lot of facts on their side this year. The
fine print at the back of the Common-
wealth Budget documents showed this
clearly: the item “Transfer payments
add net advances to the States” is due
to rise by only 5.8 percent this year,
compared with 10.5 percent last year.
Of course, Commonwealth Treasury
officials are quick to point out that this
is somewhat misleading, because it
excludes Commonwealth - authorised
loan raisings and includes last year’s
substantial payments to sugargrowers.
They prefer figures which show a 7.6
percent increase to $2,546 million this
year, compared with 10.4 percent last
year. But since about a fifth of this is
“tied money” in the form of specific-
purpose grants, you can get a different
result again if you tot up only the
amounts granted or authorised by the
Commonwealth, free of strings, which
comes to $2,089 million this year, 6.7
percent up, compared with the 9.4 per-
cent increase last year.
But whichever way you look at the
figures, the States are down on last year,
and so far as N.S.W. goes, Mr. Askin
is on very strong ground when he com-
plains about the N.S.W. share of the
total of Commonwealth payments to the
States.
During years of lazy Labor Govern-
ment, N.S.W. slipped well behind Vic-
toria in its per capita receipts from the
Commonwealth. Some headway has
been made in restoring the relationship,
but the gap remains. In State works
and housing funds, N.S.W. will this
year be getting only $51.06 per head,
compared with $53.90 per head for Vic-
toria. The gap deprives Mr. Askin of
$l2 million. Even more serious is the
discrimination against N.S.W. in its
authorisation to raise loan money for
its semi-Governmental authorities, which
provide sewerage, water supply, gas,
electricity, and harbor facilities. While
Victoria is authorised to raise
$121,420,000 this year, N.S.W., with a
million more people, is only permitted
to raise $109,950,000. This discrepancy
costs Mr. Askin a cool $4O million.
Commonwealth Treasury officials in
Canberra readily concede that, by any
objective criteria, N.S.W. should be
granted a higher rather than a lower
per capita payment. Sydney’s sewerage
needs are greater than Melbourne’s, and
more expensive—the pipes have to go
through rock and clay rather than sand.
N.S.W. water supplies are more costly
than those of Victoria, which is blessed
with a heavier and more regular rain-
fall, last year’s abnormal drought aside.
N.S.W. is the more dispersed State, with
greater needs for road works.
But they justify the present situation
by saying it is simply a historical hand-
down. The late Mr. Cahill just wasn’t
up with other Premiers in extracting
money from the Commonwealth when
he ruled in N.S.W., and since the shares
of the States were later “concretised”
annual increments were all that could
be argued over.
Treasury officials had a difficult time
preparing for Mr. McMahon the draft
of a reply to the letter being circulated
by Mr. Askin last week. All they could
point to was the fact that the N.S.W.
deficiency has slowly been getting rela-
tively less severe. It was worse several
years ago.
It is hard for the Commonwealth to
tell the States that they are not doing
enough themselves. Last year the States’
own taxation revenue rose by 16 per-
cent, and the Budgets now being pre-
pared are likely to ensure that this rate
of increase is continued. N.S.W. and


Queensland look likely to follow W.A.
and Victoria in imposing taxes on busi-
ness receipts.
Mr. Gorton has made it clear that
he won’t permit the States to impose
taxes on incomes or payrolls, by far
the most lucrative source of revenue, so
the State Governments are forced to go
to business. Mr. Askin is in particular
trouble, because he finds he has to go
back on previous assurances that he
wouldn’t increase taxes.
One of the few points which the
Commonwealth Treasury can put
against the States’ complaints is that
the States’ coffers are well stocked with
cash right now. Last year the States’
cash and bank balances rose by $47
million, the year before by $3B million,
whereas in previous years there had
often been declines. This suggests that
the effect of Commonwealth stringency
can be cushioned somewhat simply by
the States deciding to allow their bank
balances to run down. The States will
probably have a reply to that, however.
They can say with justice that the past
two years have been unusually good in
the loan market. Their borrowing on
behalf of small local-government
authorities has risen from $65 million
two years ago to $97 million last year.
At the Commonwealth Treasury they
guess—and they admit it is only a guess
—that such borrowing will be main-
tained. But it is quite possible that it
may fall off, especially if the Reserve
Bank tightens up on bank finance. In
that case the States will be running
down their cash balances simply to
maintain the momentum of local-
government works.
When Mr. Askin’s conference of
Premiers meets, the States are expected
to throw at the Commonwealth com-
parative figures to show how they are
being starved at the expense of Federal
works. In particular they are likely to
seize on the latest national accounts,
which show that whereas Common-
wealth capital spending rose by 23 per-
cent, State and local-government expen-
diture rose by only five percent. Com-
monwealth Treasury officials come back
on that one privately by saying that the
figures are screwy. They are sure some-
one in the Commonwealth Statistician’s
office—at the other end of their build-
ing—has got his arithmetic wrong.. “Five
percent, it couldn’t be as low as that,”
they say. “You wait for the revisions.”
They point out that last year capital
payments authorised by the Common-
wealth for the States rose by 12.6 per-
cent, but the States managed to raise
their own revenues by more than this.
Weather conditions were unusually dry,
and, therefore, suited to fast rates of
construction work. Why, then, an
increase in capital expenditure of only
5 percent?
Mr. Askin has so far shown consider-
able agility in his manoeuvring against
Mr. Gorton. He started with the most
legitimate complaint, against his State’s
share of Commonwealth money in rela-
tion to that of Victoria and the smaller
States. He then managed to get Sir
Henry Bolte on side, by joining with
him and complaining at the deal the
two were getting in relation to the other
four. Now, by further broadening his
united front, he has got three more
States in, with the possibility of a united
struggle against Commonwealth im-
perialism.
Mr. Gorton no doubt is counting on
the forces of polycentrism asserting
themselves as the States get down to
the detailed business of putting new
claims. But if the States don’t split up,
or even if only N.S.W., Victoria, South
Australia, and Tasmania stick fast, Mr.
Gorton is in considerable electoral
trouble. With the DLP waging warfare
against him for failures on the foreign
fronts, and the Premiers hammering
him for his domestic shortcomings, it
won’t require any Labor Party to lose
him votes at the next election.
TAXES
ALL THE WAY WITH W.A.
THE POLITICAL rhetoric of last year
is rarely worth recalling, but last week
Premier Askin’s call for an October 4
Premiers’ Conference, coupled with new
State taxation measures announced in
the Tasmanian and South Australian
Budgets, made a glance at the July,
1967, headlines worth while. After that
Premiers’ Conference the discussion
centred on whether or not Treasurer
McMahon had suggested the States
fund their deficits with a purchase tax
(Mr. McMahon denied it) of as much
as one cent in the dollar.
Premier Askin of N.S.W. and then-
Premier Dunstan of South Australia
rejected the thought of a purchase
tax. Taxation increases in the 1967-68
N.S.W. Budget were mostly applied to
forms of taxation already in existence.
Premier Bolte of Victoria also shied
from the thought of a purchase tax in
his 1967-68 Budget, preferring to follow
Western Australia’s lead of a one cent
in $lO tax on receipts of business and
professional turnover, and wages gener-
ally. Last week, Premiers Reece of Tas-
Tasmanian Premier Reece. ..one new
tax
mania and Hall of South Australia
proposed a one cent in $lO receipt tax
on all turnover except wages—not wish-
ing to risk a showdown with the Com-
monwealth. Earlier this year, Prime
Minister Gorton gave Premiers Bolte
and Brand until 1970 to withdraw their
States from the wages tax field.
Premier Reece’s new measure was one
single additional form of taxation
designed to raise about $2 million in its
first full year. Premier Hall had to pro-
pose six other forms of taxation
increase, as well, to bring in more than
$8 million in a full year—and, even
then, hinted that other supplementary
proposals might be necessary.
The spotlight now falls on Premier
Askin of N.S.W., whose Budget is set
down for “about the end of Septem-
ber,” according to his Treasury. Mr.
Askin has to find the most acceptable
way to raise another $2O million within
New South Wales, and there is much
speculation as to the way he will jump;
whether he will spread increases over
the field of taxation already available
to him; or, like Mr. Hall, impose higher
taxation in this field and add a business
South Australian
Premier Hall ...
seven new taxes


and professional receipts tax; or go all
the way to join Premiers Bolte and
Brand in taxing wages within the State,
as well; or, finally, come up with a new
formula—such as a retail purchase tax.
The proximity of “end of September”
to the conference which Mr, Askin has
called for October 4 has not raised
any inferences in N.S.W., but has in
Perth, where the “West Australian”
commented last week: “If only because
of its timing, N.S.W. Premier Askin’s
move for a special Premiers’ meeting
on Commonwealth-State finance would
be suspect.
“Shortly before bringing down a
Budget, which he says* will increase
taxes, is a good time for Mr. Askin to
be making a noise about Canberra’s
meanness. And even if it is less than
three months since the Premiers last
met on the subject and were allocated
their share of Canberra’s funds, what
has he to lose from another meet-
ing .. . ?”
Newspaper speculation as to poli-
ticians’ future moves does not go very
deep in Australia, usually being left to
a “leak” of information or to a con-
sensus of correspondents’ inspired
guesses. No one has tried very hard to
guess whether Mr. Askin’s ultimate
motives go beyond pressuring Canberra
before a possible Federal election: but,
to hark back to July, 1967, again, it
was said after that (in camera, as
usual) conference that the Common-
wealth had challenged the States to
take back all or most taxing powers,
that N.S.W. and Victoria had been will-
ing to accept the challenge, but the
four other States had hurriedly rejected
the idea. Could there be a move for a
reprise after all the States have faced
their present and future troubles at
Budget times?
CANBERRA
LOOKING FOR A LOBBY
THERE IS GOING to be lots of talk
this week about the activity of the
Government’s “Rhodesia lobby.” The
Government having announced after
the last parliamentary session that it
will abide by all the new sanctions
being organised by the United Nations
against the Smith regime, a number of
members are going to raise the matter,
some of whom are sympathetic toward
the white minority Government.
Mr. Jim Killen is one, Dr. Wylie
Gibbs is another. Sir Wilfred Kent
Hughes has declared: “I am one of the
Rhodesia lobby and, what is more, I
am proud of it.”
But, on close examination, it does
not look as though there is anything
which justifies the term “Rhodesia
lobby.” Apart from the three members
mentioned, no other parliamentarian
has come out in support of the
Rhodesian regime. Labor Party spokes-
men claim there are as many as 20
Government members who are sympa-
thetic, but, whatever their private feel-
ings, these other 17 haven’t had any
noticeable impact on policy.
There is, nevertheless, plenty of scep-
ticism about the policy of sanctions
against Rhodesia. A great number of
Government parliamentarians think that
Mr. Smith’s Government is not much
worse, or a greater threat to the peace,
than a dozen others throughout the
world, and so see no reason for picking
it out for special discrimination. For
some of them, Rhodesia engenders a
certain amount of underdog sympathy.
And perhaps most Government mem-
bers are sceptical about what use sanc-
tions are, simply on the grounds that
they show no signs of succeeding. But
they are prepared to go along with the
sanctions on the argument that it is of
vital importance to Australian diplom-
acy that Australia emphatically registers
its abhorrence of the racism for which
the Smith regime stands.
Most Government members recognise
that Australia’s foreign policy is based
The “Rhodesia lobby”—“and proud of
it.” Above, Dr. Wylie Gibbs; top right,
Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes; and, right,
Mr. Jim Killen
very heavily on building up relations
with South-East Asian countries and
destroying the unpleasant image of the
old White Australia policy. Rhodesia,
as such, doesn’t matter a damn to
Australia, they say. It’s not worth buy-
ing a “blue” over. They know that if
the Australian Government said it
wasn’t going to abide by the sanctions
because it thought they were useless,
it simply wouldn’t be believed any-
where in the world. It would be accused
of a racist sympathy with Mr. Smith
and his policies.
It is the fact that Cabinet waited
until the very last moment to announce
its adherence to sanctions that will cause
a lot of strife in the Party-room. Mr.
Killen will get a good hand for his
attacks on External Affairs Minister
Hasluck simply because of the imperi-
ous manner in which Mr. Hasluck has
handled the matter. It will not be only
the opponents of sanctions who will
attack him. Many sanctions-supporters
have criticised him for not being pre-
pared to argue his case, in particular
Mr. St. John and Mr. Kevin Cairns,,
who, alone in the Government Parties,
have been prepared to vigorously put
up a public case for action against
Rhodesia.
The Czech affair also adds a com-
plication. The DLP is angry with the
Government for being rebuffed in its
amendment to the motion of condemna-
tion of the Russians. When the DLP
proposed that the motion include the
proposal that the Government give
urgent consideration to diplomatic and
trade sanctions against the Russians
and their allies, the Government just
shrugged it off, saying that sanctions
didn’t work. So, even though the two
cases are very different, a charge of
inconsistency has some plausibility, and
some members may jump on that
bandwagon.
But the Labor Party will have a diffi-
cult time making much capital out of
the “Rhodesia lobby.” Three full mem-
bers is not very many out of 112 parlia-
mentarians. And the Government can
also make the debating point that the
Labor Party would appear to have its
own Rhodesia lobby. Two of its mem-
bers have been on trips to Southern
Africa.

VICTORIA
MARGE AND HENRY
FOR A free-enterprise Government,
Sir Henry Bolte’s Liberals are not
always content to laisse faire. Like the
salt in butter, a dash of State interven-
tion can also give a satisfying savor.
Never a man to overlook a vote, Sir
Henry recently reassured Victorian
dairyfarmers, during a by-election
speech at Swan Hill, that he backed
butter. In fact, he backed butter to the
extent that his Government would legis-
late to prevent cooking margarine pass-
ing itself off as butter.
“The Government will not tolerate
this. In 1968 we should be eating bread
and butter and not be back in the
Depression days of eating bread and
dripping,” he told the Swan Hill elec-
tors, whom he hopes will carry the seat
for the Liberal Party.
A farmer himself, with strong coun-
try representation in his Government,
Sir Henry’s Party often finds it possible
to function as a more effective Country
Party than the Country Party, which has
held the seat for many years.
An even more splendid feather in his
cap was the tale he told of how he had
resisted city attempts to divert water
from the Murray irrigation system dur-
ing the long drought. A day later, the
Minister for Agriculture announced the
outline of amendments to the present
legislation covering the sale of mar-
garine. The amendments would prohibit
margarine from looking like butter, and
would require that cooking margarine
be labelled to prevent any confusion.
What must have puzzled many people
who prefer to pay 38 cents or 40 cents
per pound for cooking margarine was
the fact that the advertising campaign
for Stork Margarine, which started the
Government hullabaloo, did not resort
to “subterfuge and misrepresentation”
as the Minister, Mr. Chandler, said.

The two months of saturation advertis-
ing by Rosella Foods, the manufacturers
of “Stork,” invited people to “taste the
difference,” but all the tasting sessions
at least implied that the taste of marg-
arine was being compared with the taste
of butter: that “Stork” was a different
product.
Behind the noise of the pro- and
contra-margarine voices, representatives
of Victoria’s 28,000 dairy-farmers were
quietly deliberating on the depressed
state of the dairy industry. On the
morning after Sir Henry’s Swan Hill
speech, they began to consider their
resolutions at a “monster meeting” at
Warrigal, 60 miles from Melbourne.
But they seemed to expect more than
protection from a cooking margarine
that didn’t even pretend to be a table
margarine.
ADELAIDE
CURBING A CULT
VICTORIAN PRECEDENTS were
rated highly in South Australia last
week when the Chief Secretary, Mr.
Degaris, said that legislation would
shortly be introduced to curb the cult
of Scientology, similar to that which
bans the organisation in Victoria. He
explained that Scientology had been dis-
cussed at the recent conference of
Ministers of Health in Darwin, and
following this the South Australian
Cabinet had been thoroughly investi-
gating the matter in the light of increas-
ing complaints about the organisation
made by members of the public.
The Premier, Mr. Hall, also spoke
on the proposed measures and in some
detail. Referring to the “pernicious
theories and illusory goals” of the cult,
he went on to describe its beliefs as
“an extraordinary mixture of mythology
and paranoid fantasy,” and to maintain
that “all the evidence available is that
the organisation is dangerous to mental
health, and nothing can be said in favor
of it.” Since its banning in Victoria,
the organisation appears to have set up
its headquarters in South Australia.
Styled the Church of Scientology, it has
of late been increasingly and openly
active.
Following the announcement, the
organisation itself called for a select
committee to which it could put its
case, and then threatened to take action
for defamation against the Premier if
he repeated his statement outside the
House. There were also words of caution
from the South Australian Council of
Civil Liberties. In a letter to the
“Advertiser,” it held that the Victorian
legislation was a blanket ban which
removed the necessity of proving, by
ordinary processes of law, that Scien-
tologists are, in fact, guilty of miscon-
duct. It felt that what the law should
seek to eliminate is not the belief, in
itself, but the various forms of miscon-
duct which are attributed to its adher-
ents. It is a point which could be well
taken.

After the Russian boots
comes the economic crunch
A Czech girl tries a little gentle persuasion on a Russian soldier in
Prague with a picture of Czech leader Dubcek. — AAP-AP picture
TO SUGGEST that the Czechs and
Slovaks have come to terms with their
unwanted and uninvited guests after
three weeks of military occupation
would be a gross misrepresentation.
What they are attempting, however, is
to devise a way of life which recognises
the naked facts of power and work out
a formula for carrying on as best they
can under a situation they are powerless
to change.
The full rigor of the Moscow diktat
imposed on Czechoslovakia’s leaders is
now fairly clear. It will permit Mr.
Alexander Dubcek, his Party leader-
ship, and Government to resume the
road toward what is laughingly called
“normalisation” just so long as they
stick to Moscow’s interpretation of
normality. There was a brief mani-
festation of relief when the enlarged
Central Committee was permitted to
vote into office a Party Presidium
enlarged from 11 to 21 members which,
astonishingly, is composed predomi-
nantly of progressives. Only the former
Slovak Party leader, Vasil Bilak, now
thoroughly discredited, represents a
minute pro-Soviet faction.
But obviously the Russians did not
mount the largest peacetime military
operation ever merely to reinstate Mr.
Dubcek and his friends and pretend
that the invasion was a non-event;
unless, of course, the improbable should
happen and the Soviet Presidium, said
to be in a state of some disarray,
should have second thoughts about the
wisdom of its action.
Prague is a whirl of hypotheses and
theories, none of which can be advanced
with any certainty because of the
unknown factor: Russian intentions.
But there have been sufficient warnings
to demonstrate that the Russian
divisions, only very slightly withdrawn
from public view, stand poised ready
to intervene at the slightest hint of
“counter-revolutionary” activities.
One theory, which deserves consid-
eration because of its simplicity, is that
the Russians intend to sit back, watch
the Czechoslovak leaders repeat their
old “errors,” shout “we told you so,”
and roar back in to impose a govern-
ment of their own selection or even a
military administration. Russian,
Polish, and East German newspaper
reports last week, with their un-
varnished denunciation of the new
Presidium, would seem to lend weight
to this hypothesis.
Alternatively, if Mr. Dubcek, Premier
Oldrich Cernik, and President Ludvik
Svoboda attempt to continue effective
government within the confines imposed
by the Russians, they may rapidly work
themselves into the position of becom-
ing a second Gomulka government
of erstwhile liberals and destroy their
credit with their own nation by keeping
a facade of a national government while
carrying out the Kremlin’s orders. This
thesis is supported by the presence of
a tiny conservative minority in a
.largely progressive presidium. Sup-
ported by Soviet firepower, Mr. Bilka’s
vote could represent a veto.
At Russian behest, the emergency
14th Party Congress, held while the
leaders were in Moscow, has already
been declared null and void. A “re-
run,” which Mr. Dubcek would have
liked to hold on the original date, Sep-
tember 9, has been mysteriously post-
poned to a later date, probably in mid-
October. This is presumably a neat
gambit to provide time for pro-Russian
elements to be consolidated and to pack
the Central Committee, thus reversing
Mr. Dubcek’s original intention to
purge it of its last pro-Novotny mem-
bers.
In the present hiatus, euphemistically
The Soviet persuaders: armed soldiers
in a Prague park and a soft-liner
called the first phase, there appears to
be no great rush by the Russians either
to withdraw or to assert themselves in
the direction of government affairs.
True, their men have been inserted into
key posts in most Ministries, notably
the Ministry of the Interior, which con-
trols the security police, but they seem
at the moment content to allow matters
to run along the established lines.
It can be argued that the Russians
have successfully achieved their priority
targets: to take control of the western
borders and to end free expression of
opinion with a repressive censorship,
the prohibition of free assembly, and a
ban on all non-Communist political
organisations. What, to Moscow, is
more important is that they have
snuffed out the Czech flirtation with the
West, which the Russians read,
erroneously, as an intention to defect
from the Warsaw and trade pacts.
It is true that the Czechoslovak leaders
had their eyes on closer economic and
political ties with West Germany; that
would not, however, have weakened
their other obligations.
The enforced resignation of the
Deputy-Premier, Dr. Ota Sik—author
of the economic reform movement,
who is now in exile in Belgrade—is
symptomatic of a dark economic future.
Not that Czech economic liberalism
depended on one man; there are plenty
of his disciples still around capable of
implementing his ideas given half a
chance. But it was Dr. Sik who first
recognised that political advancement
proceeds side by side with economic
liberalism and vice-versa. He was also
guilty of appreciating that a sophisti-
cated industrial society requires ex-


A downcast Dubcek attends a Central
Committee meeting in Prague on Friday
on the Czech situation
posure to world competition and the
stimulus of open markets. Only a few
weeks ago he repeated -his hopes of
seeing a fully convertible Czech cur-
rency within five years, given sufficient
credit incentive from the non-
Communist world. The men he left
behind see a bleak future before them;
the program for economic reform will
be retarded by at least five years.
There may be an attempt by the
Russians to do a little window-dressing
in the shape of more favorable raw
material and industrial prices, and
maybe an increase of exports to per-
suade the Czech nationals that life with
big brother is not so bad after all. But
these are likely to be only temporary
features, which will be offset by the
loss of hard-currency earnings, foreign
trade revenues, tourism (on which there
has been heavy investment), and a return
to bilateral barter deals. Added to this,
of course, is the cost of the occupation
in damage, loss of production and trade,
conservatively estimated by economists
at around $5OO million a week during
the fortnight when economic life was
almost totally disrupted. The economic
consequences of the occupation will
take at least tw 7 o years to rectify.
The only constant factor on the
Czechoslovak political scene at this
moment is the shadow of the Soviet
tanks, which makes all the rest seem an
esoteric exercise in semantics. It would
be very strange if Mr. Dubcek were
permitted for long to continue running
a government even remotely resembling
his pre-invasion administration.
YUGOSLAVIA
THE UNEASY BORDER
YUGOSLAVIA is now unmistakably
arming itself against the threat of
military invasion by Russia after 12
years of uneasy attempts to find a way
of living together.
Relations between Moscow and Bel-
grade are effectively in ruins and no
further attempt to improve them is
likely during the lifetime of the 76-year-
old President Tito.
The situation is back to what it was
in the days of Stalin if anything,
rather worse, since the present Soviet
leaders are so much jnore unpredictable
than Stalin.
Moscow now regards Belgrade,
rightly, as the source of the “liberal
infection” that has spread in varying
degrees to Rumania and Czechoslo-
vakia. The fury of* the Russian Press
against Tito has not been equalled
since he first broke with Stalin in 1948.
But the Yugoslav people are mostly
relieved that the true state of their
relations with Moscow has come to the
surface. They now know who the enemy
is, and their apprehension is giving way
to militancy.
Tito himself was deeply shocked by
the Russian invasion. On his last visit
to Moscow he told Brezhnev—in the
presence of Podgorny, Kosygin, and
Suslov “one had better not try any-
thing by force.” Brezhnev’s reply re-
assured Tito, so he will never trust them
again.
The Yugoslav leadership has a series
of problems to face which it has man-
aged to avoid over the past 20 years.
Their ambivalent relations with the
West need now, as never before, to be
rationalised - if only for economic
reasons (more than 50 percent of Yugo-
slavia’s foreign trade is with the Soviet
Union and its satellites).
Emergency military preparations
have now been completed. But whether
these measures will be enough to deter
or withstand a major attack by the
combined Soviet, Hungarian, and Bul-
garian forces near the Yugoslav borders
believed to number 50 divisions
is a question few Yugoslavs would
readily answer.
The Yugoslavs have an equal number
of divisions now in the field, but they
are outnumbered locally three to one
in the air, which makes Belgrade ex-
tremely vulnerable. But if an onslaught
comes no one seriously believes that
it will be anything but partisan war.
One problem facing the Yugoslav forces
is that their equipment is Russian. They
had American arms until the ’sixties.
How the West, particularly the
NATO powers, would react to an
invasion of Yugoslavia is continuously
discussed in Belgrade. There seems
little doubt that the Mediterranean
NATO powers, especially the United
States, have a vital interest in keeping
the Yugoslav Adriatic coast out of
Soviet reach. The U.S. Sixth Fleet
would be put at some disadvantage if
the Soviet fleet could establish bases in
the Adriatic.
WASHINGTON
UNFINISHED CONGRESS
HOARSE Democrats and refreshed
Republicans trickled back into Washing-
ton last week to clear up unfinished
business before departing once more,
this time for the election campaign.
Mostly it is the usual chores, made
rather more burdensome this year by
the drift and querulousness which has
characterised a Congress without strong
leadership. There are Appropriation
Bills to be dealt with which should have
been passed before the financial year
began on July 1. There are conferences
to be held between representatives of
the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives to straighten out differing
versions of Bills. But to the Speaker
of the House of Representatives, Mr.
McCormack, there is nothing which
cannot be dispatched by the end of
September. This may well be true of
the House, though it has one contro-
versial Appropriation Bill to deal with
—for foreign aid, which, having been
cut to a historic minimum in the
Authorisation Bill, has a second, perhaps
crueller, gauntlet to run.
But in the Senate the Democratic
leader, Mr. Mansfield, is gloomy. He
predicts a session suffused with
“gaseosity” and that Congress will have
to return in December (last year it did
not shut up shop until December 15).
For one thing, he suspects that mem-
bers up for re-election will take full
advantage of the publicity which the
congressional platform provides. The
Senate may also face a bitter debate
over reform of the gun laws; advocates
of registration and licensing, defeated
in the House, are to try again in the
Senate.
But Mr. Mansfield’s forebodings
chiefly concern the nomination of Jus-
tice Fortas to succeed Mr. Earl Warren
as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
President Johnson announced his choice
at the end of June, but bipartisan hos-
tility to Justice Fortas and to the Court
itself kept the hearings of the Judiciary
Committee going until it was time to
depart for the Party nominating con-
ventions. The clashes between demon-
strators and police at Chicago are only
The way the

too likely to harden the determination
of the Court’s enemies to punish it for
requiring fairer trials of people accused
of crime or violence—at the expense, it
is alleged, of the police and society.
Mr. Mansfield hopes to bring the
nominations (including that of Judge
Thornberry to succeed Justice Fortas)
to the floor this month. But he says
that debate in the Senate might have
to be deferred until after the elections.
If the Southerners and their Republi-
can allies then remain determined to
talk Mr. Fortas’ nomination to death—
and have the votes, as they claim, to
prevent the shutting-off of debate
they will be in a strong position to
do so; members of Congress will hardly
s"ay in session over Christmas.
THE PRESIDENCY
MISSION BY NIGHT
ONE OF THE stranger confrontations
of this strange political year took place
last week. A deputation of four young
men led by Senator Robert Ken-
nedy’s former legislative aide, 21-year-
old Adam Walinsky—made their way
by appointment on Thursday night to
the home of Senator Eugene McCarthy.
None of them except for one who
had briefly served as McCarthy’s Press
secretary (the first of a succession
of four) —had been intimately involved
in the original McCarthy quest for the
Democratic nomination. But their pur-
pose was simple, blunt, and direct. It
was to get the Senator to change his
mind over his consistent refusal so far
to lend his name to any Fourth-Party
effort in the actual November election.
The Senator heard them out for half
an hour, and at the end apparently
gave them no commitment either way.
Yet the mere fact that such a meet-
ing took place involving, as it did,
some improbable participants—is prob-
ably the best proof of just how desper-
ate the plight of radicals and dissenters
in America has now become.
At the moment their cause in terms
of the ballot-box rests on two splinter
organisations, the Peace and Freedom
Party originating in California and the
Freedom and Peace Party, more
recently founded in New York. Need-
less to say—since this is the way of
Left-wing undergrowth the world over
each is now at loggerheads with the
other.
The Peace and Freedom Party, which
scored a striking success in assembling
100,000 signatures to get on the ballot
in California last summer, is now an
organisation predominantly identified
with the Afro-American nationalist
organisation the Black Panthers. Its
candidate for President is a 33-year-
old Black Panther leader, Eldridge
Cleaver, whose main claim to fame is
a fine and sensitive autobiographical
book, “Soul on Ice,” written during the
nine years of his life that he spent
serving jail sentences. 1
The Freedom and Peace Party also
has a Negro as its candidate the
‘more familiar figure of the civil rights
activist and nightclub entertainer Dick
Gregory, who has as his running mate
Mark Lane, the indefatigable critic of
the Warren Commission finding on the
assassination of President Kennedy.
Quite apart from the internecine war-
fare between the two Parties—which
recently in New York led to the draw-
ing of a gun in the apparently effective
bid to settle the choice of a Senate
candidate—both organisations, even put
together, are unlikely to gather even the
smattering of votes still collected in
American elections by vegetarian and
prohibition candidates.
Hence the meeting in Senator
McCarthy’s home last Thursday night.
It was prompted at least in part
by Eldridge Cleavers offer to withdraw
in favor of the Senator in all the States
- the total number is uncertain and is
thought not to be very large where
his own name is already on the ballot.
But even given that offer, none of those
who approached McCarthy wasted any
time pretending that there was now the
remotest possibility of mounting an
effective, nation-wide, anti-war Presi-
dential campaign across the length and
breadth of the United States (if only
because in most States the date for
candidates to register has passed).
They did, however, argue that a
worthwhile token effort could still be
made if only the Senator would allow
his name to appear on four or five
State ballots (where the filing deadline
has not gone), including those-in Cali-
fornia and New York. Without him,
they acknowledge completely, all they
would demonstrate would be weakness:
with him, they pleaded, they could yet
shake the old-line Parties to their
foundations.
For all the variegated anti-war
forces, Senator McCarthy undoubtedly
remains the sole viable figurehead. On
the surface his position is clear enough:
McCarthy...not sulking in his tent
last week he sent affidavits denying
any interest in running for the Presi-
dency to every State where sufficient
signatures have been collected to place
his name on a fourth line of the ballot
(in more than 40 States ex-Governor
George Wallace of Alabama is already
comfortably occupying the third).
Yet, for once, the private impression
the Senator gives does not quite
correspond with the public position he
has taken up. Far from sulking in his
tent (he is accused of this by both Left
and Right), he remains primarily con-
cerned about the future of all those,
especially the young, who followed
him through nine months of pre-
. conventional campaigning only to end
up by having their heads broken and
their dreams shattered by the Chicago
police.
Something, according to those who
were with him, happened to McCarthy
at the Chicago Hilton Hotel when he
saw with his own eyes what kind of
official conduct the Party’s chosen
nominee was prepared to condone and
defend in the interests of winning the
“law and order” vote.
It is the Senator’s mood that is now
the threat to the Democratic Party.
McCarthy, if only because he remains
convinced that Nixon will win the elec-
tion, still seems to have little appetite
for playing any direct part in the
destruction of Hubert Humphrey. (“I
wish,” he will say with just a hint of
malice, “that he could somehow get
larger crowds. Those 200 people he got
for his homecoming in Waverley last
week have made it impossible for me
to go back to Minnesota. I just don’t
want to make Hubert look that bad.”)
But it remains at least a possibility that
he could lend his support, though not
probably his name as candidate, to an
effectively co-ordinated Fourth-Party
effort.
Even many of his closest former
campaign aides regard this course as


disastrous. But the restraints and argu-
ments of self-interest that bind most
orthodox politicians simply do not
operate in McCarthy’s case. Revealingly,
he now displays a withering contempt
for his anti-war rival at the conven-
tion Senator George McGovern
if only because McGovern consented,
where McCarthy refused, to hold
Humphrey’s hand aloft in the tradi-
tional show of unity that followed the
nominee’s acceptance speech.
Nor are his ways of judging people
those of most other practitioners in the
political game. “You know,” he says,
recalling the now-famous meeting in
Chicago when two Kennedy advisers
asked him to withdraw his candidacy
in favor of Teddy Kennedy, “I rather
liked Steve Smith” (the Kennedy
brother-in-law whom he had never met
before). “When I eventually told him
that, OK, I’d go along if they could
put it together, I added that though
I’d do it for Teddy I’d never have
done it for Bobby. And he looked me
straight back in the eye. That’s the
kind of man you can get along with.”
Yet the Kennedy clan nonetheless
seems likely to provide the final insur-
mountable barrier between McCarthy
and the White House, even in 1972.
And that, perhaps, is another reflection
that should cause the Humphrey forces
concern. “A politician of over 50 with
no further ambition,” McCarthy used
to love to say in the early days of his
campaign, “is a very dangerous figure.”
The Democrats could still discover to
their cost that that is even truer today
than it was nine months ago.
SINGAPORE
AFTER THE SPREE
From HARVEY STOCK WIN
HAVING INDULGED its fancy for
Hawker Hunters and other weaponry,
Singapore has been put on notice that
the long series of painless Budgets will
very likely end next December.
This much was made perfectly clear
last week by Finance Minister Goh
Keng Swee, although he did not, of
course, indicate what form the higher
taxation would take at the upper
limit Singapore income tax only takes
50 percent, compared to 55 percent in
Malaysia. While Dr. Goh’s own Key-
nesian solution to the departure of
British Service expenditure from Singa-
pore’s economy or the need to restrain
consumption for balance of payments
reasons would also appear to call for
budgetary impositions, Dr. Goh saw
increased defence expenditure as the
main reason. This, he revealed—in an
address to the Economics Society of the
University of Singapore would
amount by the end of 1969 to ten per-
cent of Singapore’s GNP. “Only the
embattled States of the Middle East
mount defence expenditures of this pro-
portion,” Dr. Goh pointed out.
Earlier he had justified this sudden
econo'mic development in typically wry
fashion: “If you assume that sweet
reasonableness will prevail in relation-
ships between the States of the region
(after 1971) and also assume that every
country will be free from internal
tension, and that we all progress
harmoniously and rapidly toward higher
standards of living if you believe this
will be so, then, of course, what we
are doing will be a monstrous waste of
Dr. Goh .. ..budgeting with prudence
money. If, on the other hand, you
assume that the reasons which have
created instability in the region during
the past two decades will remain after
1971, then prudence requires that we
take the necessary safeguard. I do not
think that anybody who has addressed
his mind to the subject calmly, dis-
passionately, and objectively will come
to a conclusion different from the Gov-
ern'ment.”
Hence the fact that “the next
Budget will not be painless. It is not
open to us to finance defence expendi-
ture running at more than $3OO million
(SAB7 million) by printing currency
notes or by borrowing from other
people. A good part of this expenditure
will have to be met by increased
taxation.” Also “the necessity is both
clear and regrettable” to keep non-
Defence Ministries’ expenditure under
strict control. However, Dr. Goh could
look forward to defence expenditure
tapering off after a while so that again
there would be “more funds for hungry
Ministries.”
Hungry Singapore, for all the fore-
going, would seem, in part at least, to
place Dr. Goh on the horns of a
dilemma. On the one hand, as he him-
self has pointed out on other occasions,
the main impact of the British with-
drawal will be to drain off a good deal
of spending within Singapore, itself a
plus in the balance of payments. On
the other, many budgetary restraints
might well have the same effect, adding
constriction to contraction. The trick
will be to curtail expenditure on items
which represent a minus in the balance
of payments, while avoiding measures
that discourage investment. or slow
domestic growth.
Dr. Goh and his Ministry of Finance
advisers will no doubt have a lot of
worrying to do making sure that what
is not painless is also not unduly
painful.
NEW ZEALAND
PILL NOR "TABLET"
NEW ZEALAND Catholics, denied the
Pill, are to be restrained from having
their “Tablet” if an edict from the
Archbishop of Auckland forbidding
sales of a liberal Catholic paper is
obeyed. But love may turn to pity as
his flock view this latest act by Arch-
bishop Liston, who is nearly 80 years
old and over the retiring age of 75
suggested by the Pope.
In a letter marked “strictly confi-
dential, not for publication, not for
announcement in Church,” sent to
parish churches, the Archbishop stated:
“I direct you to cancel at once orders
your parish may have for the New
Zealand ‘Tablet. 5 It is to be a simple
cancellation with no reasons given.
There is to be no announcement to
your people of this direction of mine.
You are aware, I know, that no paper
or magazine has a right to -sales under
parish auspices. It is for the bishop of
the diocese alone to give such authority.
If a person wishes to receive the
‘Tablet’ the way is open to him or her
to take out a subscription.”
“Tablet” editor J. P. Kennedy,
formerly a journalist with the Mel-
bourne “Herald,” said, “The Arch-
bishop’s ban for that was what it was
—was a step back to the Middle Ages.”
The interpretations given to the aged
prelate’s decision range from shots in a
circulation war with his paper “Zea-
landia” to enforcement of the Papal
orthodoxy on the Pill. “Zealandia” is a
well-written, sober journal of Catholic
and worldly affairs under the editorship
of Father Symans, but, thanks to Arch-
bishop Liston’s personal influence as
chairman of its board, the paper is not
permitted to carry a letters-to-the-editor
column and, on the Pill, decision follows
an orthodox line.
“Tablet” also accepts the Pope’s de-
cision, but has allowed dissent in its
columns. It reported the views of
Christchurch Catholic doctors who said
they would continue to prescribe the
Pill, revealed that most Catholic general
practitioners agreed with Catholic
specialists who support the Pope’s
ruling, and that, according to a
“Tablet” survey, only ten percent of
Catholic doctors would not prescribe
the Pill for any purpose.
Although the ban may prove of
limited value in any circulation war, it
certainly makes the Church look odd in
the eyes of those who found the Pill
decision medieval and could hasten
realisation of the suggestion rumored
to have been made to Archbishop
Liston by the Pope that he retire.
This is the second time Archbishop
Liston has been caught out banning
liberal church papers. A university “In-
sight” was killed at birth by a Liston
letter insisting it contained “brash
journalism.” The semi - academic
quarterly “Comment” remains the only
other independent channel of divergent
Catholic view that has anything of
intellectual value to offer.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
HOW MANY VIETNAMS?
Hoover...taking the New Left seriously
WITH THE autumn university term
getting under way after the traditional
two months’ summer holiday, J. Edgar
Hoover, head of the FBI, came out
with one of his periodic warnings on
the dangers of the New Left to the
country’s educational institutions.
“Encouraged by their ‘success’ at
Columbia, the anarchists in the New-
Left movement are boldly spreading the
word that they intend to ‘create two,
three, many Columbias,’ in the manner
of one of their ‘heroes,’ Che Guevara,
the Cuban revolutionary who cried
‘Create two, three, many Vietnams,’ ”
Hoover said.
“The main thrust of the New-Left
movement arises from the concerted
efforts of the Students for a Democratic
Society organisation. Many of its mem-
bers, and some of its national leaders,
openly profess their faith in Communist
concepts and their determination to
‘restructure’ our society. One of the
militant spokesmen of this group stated,
for example, that ‘perhaps 25 uni-
versities linked to the movement would
be too much for the police—for the
dominant class—and we would get what
we demand.’
“The New-Left leaders plan to launch
a widespread attack on educational
institutions. They are relying on col-
legiate dissidents and militants to bolster
and accelerate this drive. It would be
foolhardy for educators, public officials,
and law-enforcement officers to ignore
or dismiss lightly the revolutionary
terrorism invading college campuses. It
is a serious threat to both the academic
community and a lawful and orderly
society.
“It is vitally important to recognise
that these militant extremists are not
simply faddists or ‘college kids’ at play.
Their cries for revolution, and their
advocacy of guerilla warfare, evolve
out of a pathological hatred for our
way of life, and a determination to
destroy it,” Hoover said.
At the University of California cam-
pus in Berkeley, where the entire
student protest movement in the U.S.
got its start four years ago, trouble has
already broken out. Three days of scat-
tered violence by militant students
caused the campus to be proclaimed a
“civil disaster area.” The outbreaks
stemmed from demonstrations protest-
ing over the clubbing of young demon-
strators at the Chicago Convention.
A recent report of the study commis-
sion on university governance summed
up the situation at Berkeley, which, in
many ways, parallels conditions on other
campuses.
The commission, composed of six
students and six faculty members,
recommended four basically revolu-
tionary changes on the Berkeley campus:
increased student participation in
administrative policy decisions, whole-
sale decentralisation of instructional
groupings, broad expansion of the
governing rule of Berkeley’s 28,000
students, and new concepts of rule con-
tent and rule enforcement.
Despite the noise made by dissident
students, nearly 70 percent of Berkeley’s
students expressed satisfaction with their
courses, examinations, and professors.
Sixty-six percent of students at Colum-
bia University expressed similar satis-
faction with conditions there, following
severe rioting earlier this year.
“Regarding the internal structure of
the educational institutions,” the com-
mission reported, “it is difficult to
interpret these attitudes as the heart of
the rebellious sentiment. The student
movement is primarily a political move-
ment, critical of the role the university
plays in society.” The university “is a
vital part of the ‘knowledge industry’
and thus contributes in important ways
to shaping society in forms which evoke
neither respect nor affection. It is little
wonder, then, that many students are
no longer content to spend their college
years preparing to ‘take their places’ in
society . . .”
TROUBLE WITH PANTHERS
“HE’S ONE of the most beautiful men
I’ve been privileged to meet”—an odd
description, indeed, of a man being
tried for murder. Yet an Episcopalian
clergyman spoke in just such terms of
Mr. Huey Newton a young Negro
social revolutionary who founded the
Black Panthers—at his trial in Oakland,
California, for shooting a policeman
last October. But many Californians
admire Mr. Newton and other gun-
carrying, leather-jacketed leaders of the
Black Panthers, even though they repre-
sent a new phase in extreme black
nationalism that frightens most whites
and many Negroes.
Their ritualistically titled leaders —
including the alleged murderer, New-
ton, who is “minister of defence”—
have been seeking to evolve a theory
of Black American revolution. They
have taken more openly to the gun than
have other Black Power groups. Their
other special characteristic is that they
have made a political link with the
white community, through the Peace
and Freedom Party in California and
other Left-wing “new politics” groups
in other States, in a common drive for
votes this autumn.
The trial of Mr. Newton became a
focal point for militancy, for both
black and white. The white lawyer,
Charles Garry, claimed that New-
ton was “a victim of the system of
white oppression.” This was strong talk
on behalf of a man charged with shoot-
ing a policeman in the back. It is also
not entirely true. Newton grew up
in a good Negro home complete with
an employed father. The son got into
junior college, even for a time into a
law school, where he learned enough to
pontificate about the rights of citizens.
But he was an early rebel, and, like
many Panthers, in jail for assault before
the present episode. In choosing a jury,
however, Mr. Garry put great stress on
the claim that the cards were stacked
against the poor black. Laying an elab-
orate groundwork for appeal against
conviction, he argued that the police
were the instigators of the trial “t»
destroy Huey Newton.”
The Black Panthers are attracting
young Negroes all across the country.
Founded in racially tense Oakland by
Newton and another college friend,
Two of the extremist Black Panthers,
who frighten most whites and many
Negroes
Bobby Seale, who carries the title of
“chairman,” they refuse today to dis-
close their numbers. But some estimates
suggest that they run into hundreds in
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and
other metropolitan areas, and they mus-
tered 5000 people some months ago at
an Oakland rally to celebrate New-
ton’s 26th birthday, and raise legal
funds. They organised initially, they
claim, for “defence,” much as white
vigilante groups have done, and took
advantage of the constitutional privilege
by which American citizens may carry
unconcealed arms, to go around in
public with loaded rifles. Some 15 Black
Panthers are now awaiting trial in the
Oakland and San Francisco area, most
of them for shooting frays with police,
or being found with hidden arms. Fresh
shoot-outs have erupted recently between

Secret Service protection now provided
for all serious candidates for the Presi-
dency. Aged 32 (too young, by three
years, for the White House), he has
already done a seven-year stretch in
prison for assault, sharpening his wits
and literary talents meanwhile. He is on
the staff of the bellicose San Francisco
magazine “Ramparts,” and has written
a moving book, “Soul on Ice.”
His oratory appeals to Leftists, who
share his alarm about conditions in the
ghetto. The Vietnam War comes into it,
also. Panthers want a law prohibiting
any black from serving in the Armed
Forces. Mr. Cleaver has helped to forge
links between the Panthers and the
white Leftists, seeking some bond
between the two communities of white
and black to prevent, he says, all-out
race war.
NOT SO AMATEUR
THE COMING of open tennis to
Forest Hills brought a host of sur-
prises, as it had to Wimbledon. Great-
est surprise in both tournaments was
the strength of the amateurs, for whom
mass slaughter at the hands of the pro-
fessionals had been predicted for years
by the opponents of open tennis. At
Wimbledon, four amateurs had reached
the quarter-final round along with four
pros. At Forest Hills, three amateurs
and five pros survived to that round
and Virginia Wade, an English amateur,
got to the finals of the women’s event.
A further surprise at Forest Hills was
the collapse of Australia’s Fred Stolle,
who lost to a 23-year-old English ama-
teur, Peter Curtis, in the first round;
Tony Roche, beaten by Pancho Gon-
zales, 17 years his senior, in straight
sets; Roy Emerson, a straight-sets vic-
tim of American amateur Arthur Ashe;
and world champion Rod Laver, elimin-
ated in the fourth round by South
African professional Cliff Drysdale.
Laver had at least the partial excuse
of persistent hand and wrist injury.
Americans took heart from these re-
sults in thinking about the Davis Cup
in the future, when pros undoubtedly
will be permitted to play along with
amateurs. However, Australia still had
John Newcombe and Ken Rosewall,
who did well at Forest Hills, in reserve
for Cup play. And there was always
Harry Hopman as captain, whom the
Americans consider to be worth “fifteen
a game” when sitting on the sidelines
during Cup matches.

Up North with Gorton
The Prime Minister being greeted by Aboriginal children at the airport at Weipa. The Aboriginal
children were lined up on one side and the white on the other
By DENIS O'BRIEN
THERE WERE odd moments of low-
key farce, like the major effort on
Groote Island to pretend that every-
thing was normal when all the time
the place was almost shut down by a
strike and the silver paint was still wet
on the oil drums lining the lookout
point over the crushing plant; or when
Roger Dean, the Northern Territory
Administrator, bounced fussily down the
steps of the VIP flight at Darwin, kissed
his waiting wife, and then whirled to
greet the Prime Minister as if he hadn’t
just travelled with him all the way
from Melville Island.
Thank heavens though for the giggle
which helped ease the gruelling pace of
Mr. Gorton’s dash through develop-
mentland last week. This was serious
business for a man who appreciates
stern simplicities, and, amid the funda-
mental reasons for much of the opti-
mism on Australia’s stock exchanges,
Australia’s Prime Minister was up to
his enthusiastic ankles in mineral ores
and down to his basic best as a low-
voltage political charmer.
It was the last week of Mr. Gorton’s
56th year (he was 57 on Monday), and
during it he became a wiser man and
possibly a better Prime Minister, not
necessarily a first-rate Prime Minister
but certainly a national leader who
sharpened his sense of national purpose
in terms of national development.
There was something so fundamental
about his stated reason for making the
7500-mile six-day trip that the more he
repeated it the less proudly intelligent
it seemed tc become. “When somebody
next puts up a submission to me or to
Cabinet about one of these many pro-
jects, I will have had some personal
knowledge of what they are talking
about,” was one variation of his theme.
“There is no substitute for going out
and seeing these things for oneself.”
The essential truth of such a state-
ment was dulled by its concomitant
admission that major decisions affecting
the nation’s development might have
been made in ignorance or on third-
hand advice. But Mr. Gorton isn’t
a man to worry about such subtle
ironies and he has now exhaustingly
demonstrated that he wants to spread
himself as Prime Minister through every
syllable of Australia, not just slur his
way rhetorically through parts of it.
The Asians might not have found him
to be an infectiously appealing Prime
Minister, but he has caught the Nor-
thern Australia development fever.
It would be difficult for anyone not
to do so. Up North, where the sense of
timelessness is being shattered by the
savage hunger of rippers, grabbers,
loaders, dumpers, and crushers, where
the oldest Australia is becoming the
newest, and where profit is something
you can feel and sensuously share and
not just add up at the end of a day’s
trading up North is where the blood
stirs.
Can a Prime Minister’s blood stir?
I would guess that this onfe’s did. He
could show color slides, but he won’t.
He will, I would say, reflect the ex-
periences of this tour through a demon-
strably quickening awareness that he is
governing an “Australia on the march”
(as he described his tour in a reluctant
speech at the end of a long dinner at
Mt. Isa on his first day out). It was
political rhetoric. But now he has him-
self been on the march and that’s what
puts meaning into rhetoric and life
into the privileged reports he has been
reading.
The tour virtually circumnavigated
the continent and called for 14 stops
in six days. The minute-by-minute pre-
cision of the schedule smacked of
bureaucracy enjoying itself, and the
entourage had something of the appear-
ance of a royal tour caravan —a brace
of senior public servants, a couple of
Press secretaries, and a party of 13
senior newsmen. Mr. Gorton had his
National Development Minister, Mr.
David Fairbairn, along with him, and
both were accompanied by their wives.
But it was no junket for anyone. Mr.
Gorton put more effort into seeing than
being seen, and although he sometimes
hammed a little for the three cameras
which trailed him, he didn’t buy his
favors: the Press had to pay its way
for every flight mile and all but one of
the overnight stops.
If the tour sought an immediate
return on political investment, it did
not get it—no more than a handful of
impressionable voters lined the long
trail. But along the populated legs there
were signs that Mr. Gorton was begin-
ning to stump like a familiar product
of the electronic age.
He has begun to cultivate the double-
handed handshake routine, wading


AT GOVE, on the Gulf of Carpentaria, Mr. Gorton was
at his best as a low-voltage political charmer, clambering
out (above) on a jetty under construction to talk with
workman David Surgenor (right). Top right, he looks at
plans for the development of a bauxite township at Gove
with Mr. David Griffin, chairman of Nabalco Ltd. At
right, he inspects mining operations on Groote Island
amiably up to any crow that looks
friendly in that outstretched-arms
manner so much a part of American
politics.
Not that Mr. Gorton was beseiged
on his tour. At Gladstone, his first stop-
over and one of the most palpably and
potentially exciting development areas,
the bulk of the townspeople showed
only drowsy interest in the visiting
Prime Minister. Photographers in the
entourage who were hoping for a bit
of razzamatazz had to settle for the
comparative sobriety of John Gorton
shaking municipal hands and stopping
to talk to thin lines of children mar-
shalled along the roadway outside their
schools. On the road in from Glad-
stone’s little airport, the Prime Minister
saw a Baptist Church greeting which
read, “Stop and think—where will you
spend eternity? Welcome to Gladstone.”
It was better than a “Get out of Viet-
nam” placard, but it wasn’t exactly the
stuff of go-go politics.
At Emerald, 100 minutes farther
along the line, the promise of en-
thusiasm improved. Three hundred
chirpy children and a scattering of keen
adults applauded him as he stepped
from his RAAF turbojet. Half a dozen
loping steps across the tarmac and he
was pumping hands, tousling heads,
signing autographs, and posing for
amateur cameras with one arm around
little Tommy and the other around
giggling Shirley. “Ah, this is jnore
like it,” said one of the trailing photog-
raphers, shuttering rapidly “A bit of
the old American politicking this is.”
It wasn’t, but it was plain to see that
Mr. Gorton wasn’t color-blind, and in-
teresting to think of the influences at
work.
When he reached Mount Isa in the
early evening of the same day, 500
people were at the airport to greet
him. By then he was half an hour
behind schedule and it was an uncom-
mon experience to sense the eagerness
in the crowd for what was little more
than a routine visit by a fairly routine
Prime. Minister. They gave him a cheer
as he stepped from his aircraft and it
was enough to draw him, loping, to the
barrier fence. For a few brief minutes
as he passed through the crowd it was
John Gorton back there in January
stepping out of Parliament House as
the just-elected Liberal Party leader,
newly minted by mass media as a per-
sonable figure and feeling for the first
time that peculiar emotional warmth of
a mob of friendly strangers anxious to
identify with a situation. It is pos-
sible that a momentary mixing of cir-
cumstances at Mount Isa brought about
the first regeneration of the sort of
emotionalism in which Mr. Gorton be-
came Prime Minister.
The tour was a crash course in the
nation’s dynamics. Mr. Gorton applied
himself to it diligently. He was com-
fortably confident in the milieu and
ambled among Gladstone alumina dust
on one side of the nation and Kimber-
ley cotton lint on the other with the
same casual disregard for his beltless
baggy grey trousers. He not only looked
and listened, he touched, felt, and even
literally burrowed, sometimes using his
privileges puckishly, at other times with
flashes of authoritarian sternness. At
Weipa, for instance, he delayed his de-
parture for almost an hour by demand-
ing to be taken underneath the crush-
ing plant to look at that end of the
conveyor belt system. On his way back
to the airstrip he saw a dripping tap,
had his car stopped, got out, and
fiddled with the tap until he turned
it off, and then resumed his journey
with a waggish admonition about not
wasting water.
Prime Ministers don’t usually merit
the detailing of such minutiae, but a
few studied samples helped to balance
the crushing weight of facts and figures
unloaded at the party at every stop-
ping place. At the halfway mark in
Darwin the tour had became a phan-
tasmagoria of actualities and impres-
sions, visionary project and profitable
realities, landings and takeoffs, and
motel breakfasts. The pace of the tour
killed the momentum created by the
schedule. It began to make it seem as
if every day would be our last or that
the Ord River scheme would disappear
if we didn’t digest it in 2\ hours. The
National Development Department
arranged the tour within the maximum
time that Mr. Gorton could spend on
it. According to his Press secretary,.
Tony Eggleton, the Prime Minister had
had to plan his diary months ahead to
keep the six days clear. One had the
feeling that the whole affair was
planned by the critical path method.
In fairness, though, Mr. Gorton
didn’t embark unprepared on his saga.
The tour was meticulously detailed by
the National Development Department,
and between every stopping place Mr.
Gorton was briefed in flight by De-
velopment Minister Faifbairn, by Bill
Boswell, the solidly reliable permanent
head of the Department, and on
Government policy —by Len Hewitt,
the secretary of the Prime Minister’s
Department who carried the tour’s fat-
test briefcase and who manifested the
discretion and careful geniality of a
palace adviser. In a random moment at
Gove, on the western tip of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, while Mr. Gorton was
close questioning David Griffin,
Nabalco’s chairman, on the potentiali-
ties of the massive bauxite project, the
Prime Minister himself looked to be
carrying the nation’s fattest briefcase.
Was he carrying the files on defence,
offshore oil, Federal-State finances, and
the possible effect of the national wage
case?
Healthy cynicism about politics and
government helps protect us against
bad government, but up there on the
spectacular roof of Australia it seemed
reasonable to create a second or two
of guileless sympathy and understand-
ing for the burdens of government.
ThaPs the sort of thing that the dram-


AT MT. ISA, Mr. Gorton made a fast,
90-minute inspection of the copper, lead,
and zinc mines with (top left) Mrs.
Gorton, in hardhat and safety goggles,
and Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. chairman, Sir

atic majesty of Australia’s developing
North can do to your reasoning if you
stand still long enough up there.
Mr. Gorton hasn’t the sort of pub-
lic personality that admits such fanci-
ful ruminations, neither does he often
stand still. If the schedule hadn’t im-
posed a cracking pace, his restlessness
suggests that he would have set a
fiercer one himself. He went around
long stretches of the tour looking as if
they were agony for him, but, then, try-
ing to judge his responses and reactions
from the look on his untidy quarry of
a face is as hazardous as trying to tell
a hook by its cover. It’s a face which
can freeze a marshmallow point of
view before it has time to melt with
hot embarrassment and one which just
as suddenly can turn on a square-
mouthed smile of encouragement for
the mundane Smalltalk he is supposed
to detest. When he sat in the back of
a utility truck during an inspection of
an experimental tree-planting area, on
Melville Island, scouring his eyes with
the heels of his hands and looking
altogether as lugubrious as a farmer
who has just discovered he has rust in
his. wheat, he was, it turned out, just
trying to concentrate on what the man
was telling him. From ten feet away it
looked like the last stages of painful
boredom.
On such a tour, though, inanimate
things did bore him. At the Negoa irri-
gation project outside Emerald he
pointedly walked away when an official
had droned an explanation of the
scheme to the point of tedium. We
were being lectured more than in-
formed; all there was to look at was
an immense gash in the earth that one
day would be filled with water. John
Gorton went to talk to a woman who
was having trouble keeping flies away
from the afternoon tea, spread along
three trestle tables.
Yet soon afterward he began mount-
ing a spirited defence of the contro-
versial Negoa scheme defence I
thought he pursued with unnecessary
aggressiveness and one which he main-
tained for .most of the rest of the tour.
Gladstone was the place where there
was no mistaking his reaction. “We’ve
seen a town on the way to becoming a
city and a city on the way to becoming
a great city,” he said in one of those
confusing turns of oratory which never
quite make the same impressive sense
later as they did at the time. Glad-
stone itself is still a sleepy township
whose Main Street residents measure
material progress by the number of
motels going up —six now and another
two soon. But Mr. Gorton was seeing
the visualisation of a Gladstone which
anyone can see if he stands on the
hill overlooking the magnificent deep-
water port, flanked by its new $ll5
million alumina plant, now halfway
through its second year of processing
Weipa bauxite. It wasn’t difficult to
impress him with the thought of what a
power station could do to attract sub-
sidiary industries around the alu,mina
plant. Four days later, at Port Hedland,
he was still thinking aloud about Glad-
stone’s potentialities.
When he tramped beside the irriga-
tion ditches around the experimental
cotton plantations on the Kimberley
Research Station, asking questions,
fingering samples, and prolonging his
stay until it seemed that the sun would
fell us all, it would have been reasonable
to assume that he was more at home
than among the manganese opencuts on
Groote Island. Again the clues were
beguiling. The old Gorton family
orchard in Victoria still reaches out its
influence, but mostly provides the agri-
cultural questions which come easiest
when questions have to be asked. He
was inclined to get carried away in the
process of exhibiting his knowledge.
More significant clues to his interest in
the Ord might be derived from the
amount of time he spent exploring the
scheme’s potentialities for raising beef.
Throughout the tour he was sur-
rounded by political slide-rule minds
which have him under fairly close and
calculating scrutiny for most of the
year. The majority of the accompany-
ing Press party, which trailed him in a
Hawker-Siddeley 748 RAAF turbojet,
were members of the Canberra Press
Gallery, and nothing much that John
Gorton did or said fell very far beyond
their range of predictability. Nearly all
of them had travelled with the Prime
Minister on his Asian tour earlier this
year and they were conditioned to his
sporadic unpunctuality, occasional pre-
prandial testiness, and his post-prandial
expansiveness. He appeared to trust
them with passing confidences; they
reacted to him with guarded respect.
It is a smooth-working relationship
which neither side works too hard at,
but, on a tour which yielded pitifully
little hard news despite the closer
familiarity it allowed, some of the
astutest minds in Australian political
journalism began to stretch for copy
to meet daily deadlines. When Mr. Gor-
ton’s plane reached Mount Isa with a
breakdown in its cabin pressurisation,
a relatively minor fault briefly
threatened to break out into a PM
PLANE SCARE SHOCK PROBE by
the time it reached the south. The
strike of manganese workers on Groote
Island —brought about by the company
dismissal of a tradesman who had
refused to clean up and paint the floor
of his workshop for Mr. Gorton’s visit—
assumed the proportions of an explosive
industrial dispute up there where hard
news was stunted by mineral ores. And
when the Prime Minister briefly shared
the controls of his plane with the pilot
for a turn above the island beach
where he force-landed a Kittyhawk
during his RAAF days in 1943, well . . .
That was worth the best bright item of
the tour. Actually, there was a punch-
line which didn’t seem to get used:


soon after Mr. Gorton had gone up, the
plane lurched with stomach-turning
suddenness.
Seen against the background of his
country’s most dramatically impressive
exertions John Gorton is a Prime
Minister still just beyond focus and a
little too intimidating to encourage an
inspection of his pores. Although he
succeeded to office on a wave of emo-
tionalism and television exposure (cir-
cumstances that ignored or overlooked
his skill at the political numbers game
in the Party room), he now appears un-
willing or unable to substantiate pub-
licly the personal appeal and political
force he promised. It has been sug-
gested that he undertook the northern
development tour with an eye to the
next Federal election. This might be
true, but it denies him the innocent
virtue of actually wanting to see “Aus-
tralia on the march.” To say that he
is the first Prime Minister ever to make
such an exhaustive and exhausting tour
of developmentland is not saying much,
because the Menzies years were pre-
jet, pre-boom, and pre-inclination and
Harold Holt barely had time to accus-
tom himself to the conventions of Prime
Ministership. Yet it can fairly be said
that John Gorton inspected the traps
with a determined curiosity and the
sort of enthusiasm that wears out the
people keeping pace with him.
He resisted ceremony all the way
along the tour, preferring to sub-
ordinate himself to the unceremonious
practicalities of the developments he
went to see. At times, though, he was
so subordinate he became indistinguish-
able. When he stood among groups of
ten or more, photographers had diffi-
culty finding him in their viewfinders,
and there was one occasion among the
experimental cotton plantations at the
Kimberley research station when some-
one in the Press party muttered,
“Where is the old bastard?” The “old
bastard” was standing about five feet
away.
However dominant and prepossess-
ing he might have seemed during his
charismatic days of TV exposure
Immediately before becoming Prime
Minister, he does not now cultivate
many appealing mannerisms of the sort
which contribute to general public
evaluation of public figures. It wasn’t
a dress-up style tour, but to say he
dressed casually for it is to be
euphemistic. He wore the one pair of
crumbled grey trousers for almost the
entire six days, took off his suit-jacket
at Gladstone and didn’t put it on
again, and rolled the long sleeves of
his white shirts into such untidy
tangles that one yearned to introduce
him to the comparative comfort of
the short-sleeved variety. He will
move among crowds doing the double-
handed handshake routine, but shows
little desire to maintain such a super-
ficially gregarious manner for very
long. Toward the end of the tour I
developed the feeling that he has a
low tolerance of active public relations,
except of a very basic political kind.
He can be terse to the point of rude-
ness in the face of overdone courtesies,
which is probably one reason why he
had difficulty getting on an empathetic
wavelength with Asians while among
them earlier this year. He dislikes mak-
ing public speeches. Which is probably
one reason why he makes so many bad
or dull ones. The few he made around
Australia last week would have been
filed under “C” for cliches, if the Press
party hadn’t been so hungry for a bit
of familiar hard news.
As a politician, he is more interested
in the mechanics of politics than the
window-dressing, and on that meta-
phorical premise his tour of Northern
Australia is almost certain to bring about
a great deal of gear-changing in Can-
berra. Now that John Gorton has really
seen Australia, he wants to drive it. In a
tour which accumulated a stunning
quantity of facts and feasibilities, first
impressions became the only way of
Taking a close look at Weipa
keeping a day-to-day perspective, other-
wise Mt. Isa’s colossal industrial seni-
ority tended to dwarf the explosively
vigorous youth of the manganese project
on G'roote Island, Hamersley’s great iron
ore project at Mt. Tom Price seemed
to be the most exciting thing in the
nation until one saw Western Mining’s
great nickel operation at Kambalda
and the confident effort to establish a
large softwood and woodchip industry
on the Melville Island Aboriginal reserve
had difficulty staying in the memory at
all.
Yet, even first impressions became
unreliable. The American executive of
the Queensland Alumina consortium,
who soft-drawled us around Gladstone
on the first day of the tour, made it
seem as if Mr. Gorton was about to
make a tour not so much of his own
country but of the overseas investment
in his country. But a day later we were
back in Australia with BHP on Groote,
where Aborigines are a proud and useful
part of the workforce. The Prime
Minister himself had difficulty digesting
it all for summary opinions. At Port
Hedland, where a well-meant but
gauche civic reception forced him to
make an unwilling speech, Mr. Gorton
resorted to the stock of cliches he car-
ried on tour. “This country has, in a
sense, been a sleeping giant,” he said.
“But now it is beginning to stir, and
we are on our way to what I think is
our natural destiny. We have had a
good past, but all of the past is but a
prelude. In other words, you ain’t seen
nuthin’ yet.” On the local ABC radio
station the next morning the colloquial-
ism was shortened to “You ain’t seen
nuthin’,” which slightly revived the
trauma Tony Eggleton suffered when he
saw his master being trapped into a
speech he hadn’t wanted to make but
about which Eggleton, at the back of
the crowd, could do nothing.
Eggleton’s role in the Prime Minis-
ter’s entourage is slightly more than
that of a conventional Press secretary:
he is a smoother, fixer, linkman,
reliable ear, responsible mouth, and
keeper of what little protocol John
Gorton maintains. While on tour he
didn’t crowd the Prime Minister nor
excessively protect him. He’s a back-
ground man, dapper (the most assidu-
ously neatly dressed man on the whole
tour), gregarious, though always looking
as if he envies the cameraderie of the
pressmen he also serves. Mrs. Gorton
is so unassuming as to be enigmatic.
If her husband occasionally seemed lost
in the small crowds on tour she always
seemed part of them. She is the anti-
thesis of Zara Holt and the comparison
only arises because it is so marked.
Where Dame Zara was flamboyant,
talkative, and scatterbrained, Mrs. Gor-
ton is shy, retiring, sparingly conversa-
tional, intelligently thoughtful. Bettina
Gorton kept every appointment on the
tour (which said a great deal for her
stamina) and often suffered the bore-
dom of listening to officials who didn’t
know when to stop talking with a great
deal more patience than her husband.
At Kununurra, in the heart of the Ord
scheme, Mr. Gorton reduced one over-
anxious official to a plain state of
nervousness when he snarled at him for
not catching some chance Prime Minis-
terial remark, but there wasn’t much
official awe of the Prime Minister. He
didn’t demand it and couldn’t really
expect it when he was in shirtsleeves
and most of the officials he met were
in suits. Security was present but not
obtrusively so: a discreet Common-
wealth plainclothesman at every port
of call and one who travelled back to
Canberra in the Press plane from Kal-
goorlie. By comparison with the current
American hysteria there was something
sane about the fact that a nation’s
leader had been able to circumnavigate
his nation without the help of guns and
teargas. Mr. Gorton’s last look at
developmentland was at Kambalda,
where he was again stunned into banali-
ties by the scope, wealth, and potentiali-
ties of the operation. As he walked to
his car to.drive to Kalgoorlie airport
for the flight home, the Canberra
journalists waylaid him for a last
quote. “This,” he said, standing on top
of one of the richest deposits of nickel
in the world, “this looks like the start
of something really big.” And we went
off singing.

The finest London
club on wheels now
goes like blue blazes
So uncannily quiet is this new V 8 Rover that
one finds it hard to realise what an extremely
swift machine it is.
John Bolster of // Autosport" says: "When I first
drove the new Rover, I was absolutely
astonished at its silence."
William Boddie of "Motor Sport" says: "I would
describe it as similar to a Rolls-Royce Silver
Cloud to drive."
Yet, with all its phenomenal smoothness, this
new breed of Rover is capable of out-
accelerating almost anything on the road.
So here is an exceptional blend: a phenom-
enally quiet car of great refinement and luxury
which can nevertheless leave many a sports
car wallowing in its wake.
Beyond this, one discovers a multitude of
thoughtful extras that make a Rover a Rover
and set it that important degree apart from
other motor cars. The seats are armchairs.
The upholstery is leather. The front armrests
both centre and side—are adjustable for
height.
Hidden beneath the centre padding of the
saloon is a trinket box. A picnic bench and a
writingtableslidesilentlyfrom secret recesses.
All passengers, both front and rear, are individ-
ually catered for with respect to heating and
even with respect to control of radio volume.
Everywhere one looks, one is reminded that
a Rover provides a degree of luxury and a

Thinking straighter on roads
By PETER SAMUEL
THE RECENT victory of Paddington,
that Sydney suburb of iron lace and
iron resolve, over the New South Wales
Main Roads Department has an im-
portance beyond the immediate one of
ensuring that a picturesque area is not
despoiled by roads leading to far less
attractive suburbs beyond.
It was not just that Paddington had
a win over bureaucracy a hearten-
ing number of people do that but
that never again will roadmakers be
able to suggest, as one witness at the
inquiry into the Paddington road pro-
posal did, that his department’s job is
to build roads, not to worry about what
lies in the path of those roads.
Most Australian roadbuilding
authorities do their job to a high
standard, but in future the why and
where of roads must become as im-
portant as the how.
There were some glimmerings of an
interest in broader issues at the recent
conference of the Australian Road
Research Board in Melbourne, although
there was still the full quota of papers
on topics such as “Strength, density,
and moisture content, and soil suction
relationships for a grey-brown soil of
heavy texture,” and “The problem of
confidence and three methods of vari-
ance reduction in the simulation of
queuing.”
The immediate prospect before the
conference was that within a few weeks
the State Governments will begin nego-
tiations in Canberra for a new Com-
monwealth Aid Roads Agreement. This
will largely set the pattern of national
roads financing for the next five years.
At the same time, New South Wales
and Victoria have before the Common-
wealth requests for money for their
underground rail projects.
Mr. Gorton, in one of his first
speeches as Prime Minister, spoke of
the problems of traffic congestion in
the big cities. This has stimulated the
hope of a new Commonwealth approach
to transport. The Leader of the Opposi-
tion, Mr. Whitlam, has more recently
made the lack of any such effort on
behalf of the capital cities a major part
of his criticism of the Budget. This
suggests that the political climate is
right for a fresh approach to roads.
The greater sophistication of approach
at the Melbourne conference was largely
the work of the new Commonwealth
Bureau of Roads. With its own econom-
ists and outside consultants, the bureau
has developed what it calls “tolerability
standards.” These provide for reason-
able traffic flows and safety, but also
take into account the effects of traffic
on the people living in the area the
road cuts through.
Previous roads-needs surveys have
been rejected by the Commonwealth
on the grounds that they were “a sum-
ming of a list of unsummables,” in the
words of a Treasury official. Each
State, using its own standards, drew up
a list of its needs and costed them. The
State figures were then simply added
up. This time uniform standards have
been laid down and every assessment
panel has at least one assessor work-
ing Australia-wide.
This uniformity came under heavy
attack at the conference by State repre-
sentatives. There was resentment that
the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads
seemed to be taking over the assess-
ment of needs. State officials com-
plained bitterly that they were being
asked to operate with criteria they had
no part in framing and to make meas-
urements which they would have no
say in using.
Commonwealth officials were some-
what taken aback by the strength of
suspicion in the States, but they came
back by saying that their Australia-wide
needs survey was merely an attempt to
list what seemed the most desirable
roads to make. In his paper the chair-
man of the Commonwealth Bureau
tried to make the point that they now
wanted to get on with some benefit-
cost studies to work out which roads
would give the best return on money
spent.
The bureau has already been working
on ways of measuring the social returns
on road investments of various kinds.
In this it has made the most progress
on the evaluation of country roads. The
longest paper at the conference des-
cribed a complicated use of computers
for sorting out facts on projects for
country roads and working out what
construction standards and phasing of
work yielded the largest rate of return.
For this work cards are punched up on
how much different proposals for con-
struction will cost, along with infor-
mation about when and where traffic
flows and accidents occur, and all this
is fed into a computer which is pro-
grammed to churn out estimates of
how time can be saved and accidents
reduced, and how these relate to the
investment involved. This method was
criticised by one economist, Mr. John
Paterson, on the grounds that it did
not take sufficient account of the value
of different types of traffic using the
roads, but he was gracious enough to
say first that it was a quite remarkable
advance that working out which roads
to construct should be decided on
economic criteria instead of remaining,
as they have traditionally been, one of
the goodies in the pork barrel of poli-
tics, assessed more for their political
advantage than for their value to
society.
It is not quite clear what the bureau
is going to do with its method of
deciding between various country road
projects now that it has worked it
out. This is a very political affair, of
course. Some Commonwealth officials
would like it to be used to determine
priorities in each State, and they would
like to see uniform application. But
that is a matter for negotiation when
the Grants Agreement is being dis-
cussed.
For most of the capital cities, costly
but comprehensive studies of transport
have already been carried out, attempt-
ing to work out what networks of roads
and railways will best cater for the kind
of traffic that will occur in the future.
The bureau accepts these as useful
guides to the needs of city roads, recog-
nising that the problems of assessment
and planning are far more complex than
in the country.
What do you plan your urban trans-
port system by? What sort of city do
you imagine?
In answering these questions, trans-
port specialists split into factions.
Among engineers some believe in dia-
logue; others —the hardliners—do not.
The dialogue supporters believe in intro-
ducing economists, sociologists, psycholo-
gists, and architects, and they give at
least lip service to the thought that

transport planning must aim at some-
thing more than transport efficiency.
The Adelaide Transport Study, for
instance, was an engineers’ effort at
dialogue, and a paper by one of the
men involved, Mr. Flint, outlined the
efforts made to incorporate “community
values” into the process of designing
that city’s transport system. Simple
score ratings were made of effects of
alternative proposals on historic build-
ings, parks, schools, and the like,
whether freeway structures interfered
with views of the hills, and so on. But
Mr. Flint betrayed the narrow engineer-
ing approach when he rejected the sug-
gestion that economic and social criteria
be an integral part of the transport-
planning process. “I can’t see how you
could come out with one single simple
answer. We’ve got to adopt proper
engineering standards and stick by
them,” he said.
This got under the skin of the non-
engineers, and Mr. Flint partly retracted.
It also revealed another factional divi-
sion among the participants. The older
planners were obviously keen to get
decisions made with as little trouble
as possible, but a number of younger
transport specialists thought this was
not good enough. Mr. Pat Troy, of the
Canberra Urban Research Unit,
attacked traditional planning procedures
as authoritarian, saying that they were
usually an attempt by an untypical
middle-class professional group to
impose on the community its own
prejudices about transport and what
cities should be like. “You are trying to
optimise something quite different from
what the community is trying to optim-
ise,” he said. Community values had
to be scientifically assessed and incor-
porated into planning at the beginning
of the process of developing a design.
One of the clear conclusions to be
drawn from the conference is that
transport administrators are developing
an abundance of technical expertise.
Engineering and economic evaluations
are becoming increasingly sophisticated,
and the use of computers is quickly go-
ing to enable administrators to do im-
mense quantities of calculations in sort-
ing out priorities, developing programs
for the phases in which work should be
done, and generally giving greater
coherence to transport networks. The
expertise is being fixed up. The prob-
lems are now more institutional and
political.
And in politics engineers are the
most naive of souls. Otherwise they
wouldn’t be so reckless as to give such
great publicity to designs for vast net-
works of freeways for the year 1985
or 1990 in speculative planning exer-
cises in which the main result is to
discredit engineers. When they put out
a new plan its main effect is that hun-
dreds or thousands of people are angry
at the thought of their houses being
torn up and tens of thousands are
irritated at what seem like ridiculous
costs.
Urban transport planning has so far
been extravagant in technique but very
crude in facts it has worked on, and
the facts are crude because of institu-
tional and political problems. In the
case of Melbourne, for instance, five
years of advanced statistical and mathe-
• matical work costing $2 million has
been applied to a transport survey, the
whole basis of which is very question-
able. That basis is a mass of projections
of land-use patterns for the year 1985
by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board
of Works. The Board is more secretive
with its data than the Canberra Defence
Department, but security leaks suggest
that its data for 1985 are largely a pro-
jection of past trends plus some politi-
cally easy options. The transport study
appears to be based not on any
coherent idea of how the metropolitan
area should develop but on a projec-
tion of how it will develop if the ex-
perience of the past is reproduced in
the future. Transport planning then
becomes an effort to provide for a
projection of things as they are, not
a plan.
Melbourne transport planning is not
uniquely bad. Some big cities are bet-
ter, some worse (like Sydney, for in-
stance). Most suffer from institutional
obsolescence, a proliferation of bodies
with overlapping functions and conflict-
ing interests.
The opening speaker, Mr. Peter
Stott, London Traffic Commissioner,
emphasised the importance of appro-
priate forms of city government. He
claimed major advances in his own
city now that one organisation develops
the urban plan, devises transport to
fit that plan, and also has control
over zoning, roads, road traffic, park-
ing, buses, and railways. “Loose work-
ing arrangements between authorities
contributing to the problem are in
my view not sufficient for the future.
The element of central responsibility
is vital if key questions are to receive
rational answers.”
Generally acclaimed as the most
advanced papers of the conference were
reports on investigations into the best
future patterns for Canberra and their
transport implications. While every
single metropolitan transport plan is
vulnerable to criticism because it does
not pay enough attention to the relation
between transport planning and land-
use planning and a clear idea of
the way the city should grow (con-
versely land-use planning does not take
full account of transport possibilities
and problems), the Canberra paper, by
Canberra Traffic Engineer Mr. lan
Morison and the American consult-
ing firm Alan Vorhees and Associates,
described a design process which was
unique in its attempts to cope with the
intersections between where the roads
go and what the land is being used for.
Different arrangements of suburbs,
different distributions of employment
and shopping, varying densities and
concentrations of employment and
housing, and different city shapes were
repeatedly tested in an attempt to
gain a real understanding of their
inter-relationships. The study came to
some very practical conclusions. It
showed that to prevent a reproduction
of the expensive congestion problems
of the central areas of the major
metropolitan capitals it is extremely
important for Canberra to start right
now to decentralise employment in
dispersed town centres. Planning could
retain cheap right-of-way for elaborate
freeways, but it could never cope with
the off-freeway distribution of cars to
their final destination. And a central-
ised city is too expensive.
It showed the substantial transport
savings that would come from develop-
ing Canberra lineally along no more
than two “corridors” rather than have
it develop more slowly in several
directions at once in a general out-
ward path.
Another Canberra paper, prepared
by the transport consultants Pak-Poy
and Associates, presented the findings
of investigations into the best arrange-
ment of roads in a. newly developing
urban area. It began by recommending
principles for the roads which provide
access to homes, suggesting the cul-de-
sac and loop forms to eliminate through
traffic, a narrow width of 20ft. to keep
down speeds, and the staggering of
junctions to achieve T intersections
rather than + junctions, which create
more than four times as many accident
points. The study postulated a six-
tiered hierarchy of road types, pro-
gressively allowing greater speed and
volume of traffic while affording in-
creasing protection against accidents by
increasing control over access. One very
firm conclusion the study came to was
that the expressway form of road is
best avoided, since its mixing of over-
passes and intersections on-the-level is
inefficient and unsafe.
The obvious next step for Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth, now
that they have completed their net-
work design, is to go into the' business
of programming. It is only of very
limited value to know what sort of
transport network will fit the city of
1985 or 1990. The real value of such a
survey comes when it provides infor-
mation about what is likely to happen
when particular parts of the network
are built in particular orders.
Canberra is ahead in that aspect of
transport planning.
But, then, Canberra has problems,
which only bold leadership in govern-
ment can solve. The optimum corridor
of Canberra as suggested by the Vor-
hees-Morison survey is one which creates
a political problem. It projects Can-
berra over the boundary of the A.C.T.
into grazing country in N.S.W. And
Canberra’s planners have not yet sum-
moned up the courage to negotiate with
the N.S.W. Government how that
might be arranged. It makes eminent
town-planning sense to shift the A.C.T.
northward by about ten miles by trad-
ing land in the south of the A.C.T. for
an equivalent amount of N.S.W. Or
maybe Mr. Askin could be induced to
sell off a bit of the farm? For Can-
berra assistance in solving one or two
of Sydney’s transport problems, per-
haps?

Finish it, and finish it quickly
By MICHAEL BAUME
SO NOW we know the answer to three
of the big Sydney Opera House ques-
tions: how much it will cost, when it
will be finished, and what it will look
like inside. But there are still plenty
to be answered. Who will pay for it?
Who will use it? Who will run it?
And there is the inevitable question:
should N.S.W. spend all that money
on finishing it, anyway? What better
way would there be of spending the
remaining $55 million needed to com-
plete this performing arts complex that
will be enjoyed by a small proportion
of Sydney’s population (along with a
moderate number of tourists)? There
are plenty of people in Sydney who
would prefer that the Opera House be
left as a massive ruin, in a state in
which it is still honestly related to
Utzon’s ideal before being interfered
with too seriously by his successors.
But it seems impossible to stop now.
As Peter Johnson, Professor of Archi-
tecture at the University of Sydney,
said recently: “For a community our
size, the amount of money now thought
to be necessary to complete the Opera
House is too much in relation to our
needs in other areas of development
. . . but the only alternative we can
now accept is to complete the build-
ing in an appropriate manner.” He
added that, in any event, the cost per
seat compared favorably with similar
buildings in other countries. The Lin-
coln Centre in New York cost $l5O
million, or $17,500 per seat against
Sydney’s $1,460 per seat. But a dollar
buys a lot less in New York than it
does in Sydney; in real cost terms, Syd-
ney is still far dearer on this sort of
analysis.
Of course, the cost is staggering; $B5
million on one building is almost be-
yond belief. But some architects say that
the latest estimate is really not too far
out of line with standard practice. For
the building’s shell has cost about $3O
million and this is to be about one-
third of its final cost, which is roughly
normal for a modern building, in which
mechanical services alone often cost
more than the structure. The big ques-
tion of whether Utzon could have done
it cheaper (to which the Government
gives a resounding “no”) will always
remain. At least the Government can
claim that relations between architects,
engineers, builders, and the client have
improved since Utzon went; the poor
relations toward the end of Utzon’s
period were making things very dif-
ficult.
It is the question of who will pay
for it that is the key one. The whole
scheme outlined by Works Minister
Davis Hughes on Monday, its cost and
its completion time, depends on whether
the State Government can find the
money. If the Government cannot raise
the remaining $4O million needed
within the next five years (assuming
some payments can drag on a bit after
the proposed completion date), then the
whole question of how much the Opera
House will cost will be open again.
The present estimates depend heavily
on getting the building finished quickly;
if it is spread out over a longer period,
being done in bits and piece's, costs will
soar.
The Government is probably going to
find it very difficult indeed to raise the
cash. So far it has spent about $3O
million getting the building to its
present stage. It has another $l5 million
or so of lottery funds in kitty. And the
lotteries make about $6 million net a
year, so that the next four years should
bring in another $25 million. But all this
adds up to $7O million, or about $l5
million short of the target. With the
State Government (like all State Gov-
ernments) so desperately short of cash
Above, the opera
theatre; at right,
the concert hall.
Tabs above the
seats are for acous-
tic testing
for its essential services that it is increas-
ing State taxes even further, there seems
little prospect of the electorate putting
up with any diversion of these funds
into the Opera House. As State borrow-
ing programs are controlled by the Loan
Council (and therefore by the Com-
monwealth), there will be difficulties
for the State trying to borrow money to
finish the building, using future income
of the lotteries as security, as Mr.
Hughes plans.
So unless the State can find $l5 mil-
lion or so the Opera House is going
to take at least three years longer to
build than the latest estimate of Mr.
Hughes and costs will rise sharply.
One suggestion is that the public
might be encouraged to contribute sub-
stantial sums to the Opera House fol-
lowing the modest lead of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust some years ago
at Newtown. These visionaries think
the Opera House Trust could perhaps
ask the public to “buy” the 5800 or so
seats in the complex for, say, $lOOO a
seat as a charitable gesture.
Getting the building up will only be
part of the cost burden of the Opera
House. Maintenance costs are going to
be very high indeed, particularly in the
interior mechanical items. On top of
that, bringing the building to life is
going to require significant amounts of
State funds. When it is up it will need
to have a drama company to act in it,
an opera company to sing in it, a
ballet company to dance in it, an
orchestra (or two) to play in it. All
of these need subsidies (and most are
already getting some); operating in
the Opera House will mean they will
require even greater subsidies if they are
to keep it occupied with quality per-
formances. The Opera House will need
the lotteries for ever.
Who will run the Opera House is
another unsettled question. The Opera
House Trust, which has emerged from
the corpse of the discredited Opera
House Committee, hardly looks a likely
bet; all but two of its members will be
over 70 by 1972. And Mr. Stuart Bacon,
the general manager of the Opera
House who took up his post last year,
is already 61 and will have reached
retiring age by the time the building
is ready for use.
Who is going to use the place? There
is no uncertainty about the main hall;
the Australian Broadcasting Commission
is committed as a customer for its con-
certs and recitals. It should use it up
to 100 times a year. And some of its
recitals will go into other halls in the
building. In addition, Musica Viva will
probably use the concert hall ten to 12
times a year, as well as the chamber-
music hall. And there have already
been many requests for use of the
concert hall for conventions. There is
the prospect that some dramatic presen-
tations, not requiring a proscenium and


curtain, could be done in the concert
hall, too.
These would still leave the main hall
and the recital halls empty for far
longer than suits Mr. Bacon. It seems
likely that he may well encourage the
management of the building to take a
hand in music promotion itself, if the
ABC, Musica Viva, and other promoters
do not manage to give the halls a satis-
factory occupancy rate.
The prospect of the Opera House
Trust becoming an entrepreneur is
despite its decision taken some time ago
to keep out of such ventures.
There could even be a second
orchestra resident at the Opera House
in the long run that could provide con-
certs in addition to those by the ABC,
and this need not necessarily be simply
the opera company’s orchestra.
So there are few uncertainties or
policy problems involved in the concert
hall. It is in the opera hall and drama
theatre that usage problems become im-
portant. The opera hall will be used
for several weeks a year by the Eliza-
bethan Opera Company and the Aus-
tralian Ballet Company; the risk of
these companies riding off in a huff to
some other theatre because they did
not get all they wanted out of Benne-
long Point now seems pretty remote.
But this is for only a small part of
the year. The rest of the time the
opera and drama halls will be available
for other musical drama or for straight
drama. So far the policy decisions on
who will be offered use of them have
not been made. There is a strong lobby,
reflected in a talk given some days ago
by Peter Summerton, co-director of the
Independent Theatre, to the Sydney
Opera House Society, that favors the
installation of a State Theatre Company
as a full-time venture in the Opera
House. This would mainly use the
drama theatre, but could spread over
into the opera theatre. His view is that
the Opera House should not be made
available to everyone who wants to
put on a show there; that it should
have very high standards indeed and
should represent the hest in theatre
in Australia. If the creation of the State
company was at the expense of sub-
sidies now paid to other theatre groups
(like the Independent, for instance),
then he would still prefer to see it.
In any event, Mr. Bacon favors the
maximum usage approach, with com-
mercial theatre having plenty of oppor-
tunities to get into the theatres, but
having a lower priority than other
groups, particularly, of course, the
hoped-for resident State theatre com-
pany and the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust’s Opera and Ballet companies.
Mr. Bacon is busy outlining the
likely policy that should be adopted by
the Opera House Trust (or whatever
other body will be administering the
complex) when the building is func-
tioning. He hopes to present a report
to the Trust, soon, about its drama
policy, and this is likely to favor keep-
ing the theatres in use as much as
possible, with the help of commercial
theatre managements rather than aim-
ing at exclusivity.
But the immediate problem facing
Mr. Bacon is in the manner in which
the Opera House complex will become
available for use. “Which auditorium
is going to open when; we’d like to
know whether the Government intends
that the opera hall or the concert hall
should be finished first, and, naturally,
we’d like a firm date.”
Stefan Haag, executive director of
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, takes a
much more controversial view of the
role that the Opera House should play.
He sees it as vital that the building
should have associated with it some
drama form, for which it could become
world renowned, rather than simply
having an adequate reputation as a
conventional opera or drama or music
complex. His view is that the Opera
House’s world-wide image needs restor-
ing (“many people regard Australia and
its Opera House as a joke”), and that
it could be restored if it became a
centre for the creation of new theatrical
forms. This would need permanent
artistic personnel working in drama,
ballet, opera, and other musical presen-
tations pursuing new forms,
He has no fixed ideas about what
these forms should be, but he is think-
ing about the use of color, lights,
music, and the audience itself as in
some experimental New York ventures,
where the composer simply outlines
the direction he wants the performers
to go in. This would require remark-
able flexibility in the Opera House’s
various halls; it is impossible to design
an appropriate auditorium for an art
form that has established no formal
shape itself yet, let alone establishing
any requirements for its environment,
He thinks that the building should
also house conventional concerts and
opera. But he considers there is no
longer any prospect of Sydney being
classed among the best half dozen opera
houses in the world, as it will be in-
adequate for some operas (even though
versions of these could be done on the
opera hall’s stage),
So Sydney is to get, in double the
time originally estimated, a building
that will do much less than was origin-
ally asked for at a cost much greater
than was originally intended.
The Inside Story
THIS IS what the Opera House will
finally have inside:
• A concert hall with a 1.9 reverbera-
tion time for 2750 people in seats 21
inches wide in rows spaced between 36
and 39 inches apart. In Utzon’s last
plan this was to have been a dual-
purpose hall for opera and concerts
with his seating, alleged to hold only
1800 in normal seatings or 2500 with
row spacing as narrow as 25 inches
and with a reverberation time of about
1.5 seconds.
• An opera hall for 1500 people with
a revolving stage 47 feet in diameter
within which will be two lift platforms
along with two more lifts behind it,
giving either the Paternoster system of
scene changing (asked for by the Eliza-
bethan) or the revolve system. The
orchestra pit will hold 75 musicians
in an area that can be raised to create
a forestage. (In Utzon’s last plan, this
was to be a hall for smaller opera and
drama and was to seat 1500, was fitted
with a revolve but had an orchestra
pit that would fit only 35 musicians.)
• A drama theatre seating 650 people
with a revolve, a small orchestral pit,
and a thrust stage. (Utzon’s drama
theatre or “experimental” theatre was
in the same location.)
• A recording and rehearsal hall that
includes a gallery audience area for
400 people, giving similar acoustic con-
ditions to the concert hall. (This area
was taken up with stage machinery in
Utzon’s plan; his rehearsal hall was in
the area now taken by the stage-
rehearsal room with much space, and
was claimed by one of the acoustic
consultants to be good for only 35
musicians instead of the required 85.)
• A hall for 450 people that can be
used as a chamber-music hall or a
cinema. (Utzon had no cinema, and his
chamber-music hall was one-third this
size.)
• A room for solo recitals to hold 150
people, that could also be used for
receptions. (Utzon’s chamber-music
room.)
There will also be large exhibition
areas under the foyer, and several prac-
tice and rehearsal rooms, and electronic-
music studio.
The main halls, for concerts and
opera, will have similar decor, although
they will have different shapes. Both
will, in effect, be buildings within a
building, supported mainly by structural
steel frames, but also getting some sup-
port from the arches of the roof. (In
the Utzon scheme, the halls were to
have been made from self-supporting
plywood boxes swung from the roof.)
The concert hall’s seats will be
mainly in two sloping terraces, with
other seats in cantilevered boxes spread-
ing along both sides, and with 428 seats
rising behind and at the sides of the
concert platform.
The walls of the auditorium, which
continue on to become the ceiling, will
be given a natural finish in veneer ply-
wood with “something of a light syca-
more finish, whitish,” and gold leaf on
the back wall for contrast. The seats are
to be upholstered in an Australian
woollen fabric of yet undetermined
color.
There will be a 250-seat restaurant
under the two small shells at the
Macquarie Street end of the building,
a self-serviced restaurant under the glass
walls at the other end of the building,
and several buffet bars for liquor and
coffee.

Battlefront U.S.A.
Colin McGlashin looks at
violence in American cities,
which is an even more crucial
issue than Vietnam in this
year's American elections
WE COME IN FAST down the alley
and our headlights freeze them: a
Tactical Unit officer with a riot shot-
gun, a watchman with a guard dog,
and six black youngsters. It’s 10 p.m.,
hot, and you can smell the fear. Every-
one moves jerkily because of it, like
marionettes.
This is Chicago on an ordinary
night. No Democratic Convention, no
troops, no peace demonstrators, and no
television cameras. But the ingredients
that remain are explosive enough: a
citizenry armed to the teeth and an
oppressive climate of racial fear. It
could be almost any big city in
America at this time.
Someone tries to steal a car battery
and the watchman points out a sus-
pect. He’s about 17 and scared of being
taken away for questioning. He wants
to argue, the police don’t. There were
20 riot cars in this area last night.
The inevitability of what’s going to
happen sickens. This is a battle zone.
Its ethic is survival. There is, bluntly,
no time for justice.
Another Tactical Unit man grabs an
automatic rifle from the car and jabs
it in the boy’s chest. Arms flung wide,
he screams the ghetto’s new defiance:
“Go on, kill me mother kill me!”
(“He knew we couldn’t shoot,” said
a policeman later, but I saw the boy
and don’t agree. Perhaps the most im-
portant thing to understand about
America, this year is that the boy could
have been ready to die.)
It had been one more anonymous
incident on an invisible urban front
line. I have seen both sides of the
conflict, so far as an outsider can: what
frightens me is that it is hard to con-
demn either, or say with certainty that
one would act otherwise oneself.
The black kids and the white cops—
their pride, their fear, their isolation,
their need to prove themselves, above
all, their demand for respect are
strangely alike: victims both, prisoners
of an escalating conflict they didn’t
make and can’t control.
Last summer’s riots changed the
rules the wildly exaggerated reports
of snipers in the ghettos (only a hand-
ful later confirmed) caused a white
suburban rush to arms. Now, according
to one survey, there are enough guns
in private hands to arm every male in
America down to babes in cots.
Like soldiers at the battlefront,
American policemen now face death
every minute of their working day. It
shapes them and the way they do their
Inside a military camp in Georgia, police and troops play a war game called “civil
order” preparation for guerilla warfare which whites see as inevitable
jobs and their family life. They work
in a climate of casual violence: like
battle medics, it blunts them to the
pains of flesh.
Many have lost faith in the justice
they administer. They take shortcuts,
like carrying confiscated weapons
razors, coshes, flick-knives in case
they need to plant them on a suspect
or a victim.
Law and order, to use what is likely
to be the election’s most popular
phrase, is breaking down in American
cities, and no one knows where it will
end. Already there are areas where
police won’t go except in force to deal
with serious incidents.
In Chicago, in Convention Week, the
self-inflicted wounds of America’s vio-
lence gaped for all the world to see.
But without exaggeration, even before
the Democratic Convention, this has
often felt like a country going mad
with fear. Chicago looks more typical
than unique. New York’s liberal Mayor
Lindsay may walk through Harlem with
a hand-picked selection of theatrical
black militants. (One favorite: Charles
37X Kenyatta, of the Harlem Mau
Mau.) But he controls the police as
thoroughly as Mayor Daley of Chicago.
They have broken up peace demonstra-
tions in New York with similar
brutality, and Lindsay’s powers to put
areas under virtual martial law may
be the most sweeping in the country.
Every city here has elaborate, code-
named plans for dealing with every
kind of civil disorder: sealing off roads,
subways, telephone cables, rushing in
troops. No one, except the security
machine, knows how far the plans go.
What is happening beneath the sur-
face is worse than the battles of the
Chicago Hilton. America’s police forces
are preparing to fight guerilla warfare
in the streets. They regard it as just
a matter of time. “Yes, we are waiting
for it,” said a senior police spokesman
recently. “The nearest so far was at
Cleveland, when three policemen were
shot dead in an ambush—an incident
that has caused patrolmen to buy
high-powered rifles at $2OO a time.
What can we do except arm ourselves
more, protect ourselves more? The
rank-and-file policeman hasn’t brought
about these hatreds but has got to deal
with them. I don’t think there’s a police
answer. This is a thing other realms of
our society have to cope with.”
And the fantastic security operation
around the amphitheatre in Chicago,
where the Democratic Convention was
held the armed helicopters, the
rooftop snipers, the aerial map on the
wall of the Pentagon war-room was
not designed merely for what turned
out to be a relative handful of
demonstrators, almost always outnum-
bered by heavily armed police and
troops. It was planned months ago to
cope with anything up to virtual civil
war.
Chicago has a black population of
around one million. If its two ghettos
merged, they’d be the sixth biggest city
in the United States. The amphitheatre
is on the edge of the south-side ghetto,
which is eight miles long and, at its
widest, four miles ‘broad. The west
side, younger, poorer, angrier it ex-
ploded in April after Martin Luther
King’s murder is about three miles
square.
In Convention Week both were
naturally quiet: one meeting of youth
leaders decided to stay at home, fill the
baths with water, stock up with tinned
food; at least two black militant groups
ordered their men out of the city two
weeks before. Even moderate Negro
newspapers tend this summer to bristle
with reports of police brutality. In the
militant Press, cartoons show policemen
with vampire fangs and pointed tails.
And among the black middle class,
conversation is easily turned to the


concentration camps they believe white
America is preparing. There have been
official denials of the rumor, but the
belief remains they remember the
thousands of Japanese-Americans im-
prisoned after Pearl Harbor.
Richard J. Daley, Mayor of Chicago,
grew up at the back of the yards behind
the meat-packing plants, an area that
community-organiser Saul Alinsky says
was the worst slum in America: “A
dozen different nationalities, all
Catholic, all hating each other’s guts.
By the time you were five you learned
to fight for your life.” Alinsky went to
a union meeting there when the secre-
tary ordered a local gangster to be
removed. “I expected them to take him
by the shoulders and march him out.
Instead, they threw him straight
through a second-floor window.”
Machine politics grew up in Ameri-
can cities as the struggle of ethnic
groups for survival. Daley has remained
a man of high personal morality w r ho
has grown up with a corrupt political
system and settled for stamping out its
excesses, gathering the reins of power
A whole new generation of black
organisers are taking over street gangs,
like “Thunder” Stevens, 21, who leads
the 2000-strong Blackstone Rangers
and patronage in his own incorruptible
hands, and making it an agent for the
general public good. It is no mean
achievement. When he took office 13
years ago, department after department
was rotten with incompetents and
crooks.
He rapidly harnessed the energies of
Chicago’s community-minded business-
men, hired the best municipal techno-
crats in America, and proceeded to
perfect public services and fling up new
buildings and super-highways like mad.
Today, Chicago looks what it is the
richest place on earth, where the aver-
age income of its ten poorest
communities clears over $4OOO a year.
And where some of his predecessors
died with millions in their safe-deposits,
“King Richard” lives in a modest bun-
galow on the street where he was born,
sent his children to the local school,
and prefers to come home for lunch.
The men who measure administrative
efficiency with a slide-rule rate him the
best mayor in America. From the
ghetto point of view the awfulness
of that judgment is that it is almost
certainly true, for the system remains,
and if you’re outside its benefits the
whole process has been rather like
carpeting and repainting the Augean
Stables without calling in Hercules
first.
There is, for example, organised
crime. The syndicate doesn’t usually
wreck unco-operative restaurants nowa-
days, though in a four-year period, end-
ing in 1966, more than 100 were
bombed or set on fire. Their owners,
despite protracted inquiries, could
never suggest any reason why. Today,
however, the odd mobster found riddled
with bullets is likely to turn up well
outside the city limits.
But organised crime is far from
dead. It has joined the establishment,
is tolerated, even dealt with, so long
as it remains discreet. Thus, its prosti-
tutes and gambling are off the streets.
Chicago’s tightly controlled call-girl
system now has its own credit card.
It has “legitimised” into all sorts of
supply and service trades there’s a
cigarette-tax evasion scandal under way
at the moment. It has done well with
a credit system, known as the “juice
loan” because of extortionate rates of
interest which squeeze the victim dry.
(Repayments aren’t normally a prob-
lem one small businessman who
welshed was hung up on a meat hook
like a side of beef and tortured to
death with a blowtorch.)
According to one local newspaper-
man, five ward committeemen key
figures in local politics and the patron-
age system that ensures votes are
controlled by the mob. “Do I believe
it?” says an alderman. “Oh, yes. But
I always thought it was six.”
The days when A 1 Capone openly
ran the suburb of Cicero, holding
court in a building guarded and forti-
fied like a castle, are long gone. But
the syndicate still gathers to discuss its
operations in a hotel on Cermak
Avenue. Which makes it somewhat
ironic is that the best-selling political
issue in Cicero, half a mile from the
west-side ghetto, is crime in the streets.
Mr. Richard “Law-and-order” Nixon
is their hero, segregationist George
Wallace is twice as popular as Hubert
Humphrey. Though it’s pretty doubtful
if any black man would risk going
anywhere near Cicero. As one white
man, near the township’s thriving high-
powered-rifle range, put it: “They
know if they did, they’d leave in a
box.”
Chicago remains the most racially
segregated city in the U.S. The twin
ghettos expand at the rate of four to
five blocks a week, preceded by a panic
outrush of white professionals doc-
tors tend to be first and the forma-
tion of anti-Negro organisations futilely
trying to keep their block white.
The Administration’s attitude to the
ghetto is like a pacification program
in the Mekong Delta, complete with
tame village headmen and puppet
generals. Chicago’s black “machine”
aldermen are popularly known as the
silent seven. In the teeth of an official
report on April’s riots, which warned
that the city’s racial crisis was so serious
that “traditional or superficial measures
may prove disastrous,” Mayor Daley,
in July, called a special meeting of
the city council to rename the main
street through the south-side ghetto
after Martin Luther King. (“If that’s
supposed to placate the natives,” says
one black executive, “it won’t.”)
City Hall objections to any kind of
community control for example, of
its own disastrously inadequate schools
and health services are deep rooted.
Says a Daley aide: “If 40 percent of
the janitorial force of a newspaper is
Negro, should they then dictate and
write the stories? Poorness is not a
franchise. The Mayor often says to me:
‘I didn’t put the slums there.’ It
isn’t his prejudice that is operating.”
But now a whole new generation of
black organisations is taking over.
Street gangs like the Blackstone
Rangers, which has 2000 members, a
chain of command like an army of
occupation, and enough authority in
its area to be able to punish a member
by ordering him to stay in his house
for a month; economic boycott and self-
help groups like Operation Breadbasket,
run by a Martin Luther King aide, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who at 26 —the age
King started the Civil Rights Move-
ment in Montgomery is his most
likely successor; political groupings of
every hue from revolutionary to ortho-
dox.
If their demands not just for a
slice of the cake but for effective
participation in the making of the
decisions which control their lives
are to be met, the system, the
machinery of government, will have to
change, and not merely in Chicago.
But decisions that shape America this
year at both local and national level are
being made by men whose homes and
families are under day-and-night police
guard. Their movements are ordered
by security men whose profession
demands the assumption that every
shadow shields an assassin.
The personal collection of security
trivia in Chicago includes: the Governor
of a southern State who would not
enter a hotel restaurant for dinner until
his four-man bodyguard had looked
under the table and chairs; the Secret
Service man (they wear a tiny, highly
identifiable lapel pin) who came up
behind me in the street and peered over
my shoulder at my notebook; the very
scruffy hippie who carefully photo-
graphed me and my companion, and
later flashed a badge in a leather wallet
at a policeman; the radio car with
two armed men in riot helmets,
labelled “water purification division.”
No one is quite sure what has hap-
pened in the streets here or where it
will end. But less than three months
before a Presidential election that is
likely to be fought around the central
issue of law and order, fear is begin-
ning to look like a deadly and implac-
able foe.

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMT
Some economic thoughts for
a wayward juggernaut
THE ATTEMPTS of the employers
through their counsel, Mr. J. Robinson,
to force some econo,mic sense into the
judicial heads of the Arbitration Com-
mission last week is unlikely to succeed
without a Commonwealth-inspired
amendment to the Arbitration Act, a
restructure of the Commission itself
to leaven the judges with a few
economists, or some other major
manoeuvre. As it was, Mr. Robinson
simply managed to raise the hackles on
a few judicial necks. And the juggernaut
is dragged on through the economy.
Both the Federal Treasurer, Mr. Mc-
Mahon, and the Minister for Labor
and National Service, Mr. Bury, have
joined forces to adopt a hard line
against its hazardous progress, but there
is still considerable confusion as to how
its character may best be modified. Con-
stitutionally, the Government is able
only to issue words of caution to the
devotees.
The Commission’s apparent prefer-
ence for the sectional interests of work-
ers and employers and its tendency to
judge claims on the value of the work
performed rather than on the capacity
of the industry to pay, or, even more
important, in terms of price increases
and productivity have come a very long
way from the basic purpose of its exis-
tence: the equal sharing throughout the
workforce of national productivity.
It was no surprising news from Mr.
Robinson that the cart was still lead-
ing the horse; that in the two years to
May, 1968, a 5 percent productivity
gain had been accompanied by a rise
in minimum weekly wage rates of 12
percent, and that any further increases
would be completely eroded by rising
prices. Mr. Robinson’s plea that “Wage
earners have an industrial expectation
that increases granted by the Commis-
sion will not be eroded by price rises”
was irrelevant. The pattern he out-
lined is only too familiar by now. For
the past two decades wages have led
prices relentlessly upwards and pro-
ductivity has bobbed about in the wake
as best it may. Employers and workers
have battled on preserving their tradi-
tional portions of the national cake,
and the cake has indeed risen, though
not perhaps as high as it might.
Except for living on fixed incomes,
or those too weak to hold their positions
in the wage-cost rat-race, the process
is perfectly acceptable if Australia were
not so dependent on commercial rela-
tionships with the rest of the world. But'
it is, and out there Australia follows
and does not make the rules, particu-
larly those which govern the aggressive
rise of costs and prices.
The Government and it must be
forgiven in election year for seemingly
condoning more wage increases at the
same time—gave warnings to the Com-
mission along just these lines: 1, the
balance-of-payments situation could
quickly turn sour as a result of rising
costs due to wage increases; 2, ever-
rising costs must put a more and more
onerous burden on the export indus-
tries; 3, it was impossible to overlook
the fact that average weekly earnings
had been increasing faster than the
underlying productivity; 4, the Budget
having been framed in such a way as
to keep demand from reaching in-
. flationary dimensions, the Common-
wealth was very much concerned that
the balance of the economy should not
be upset by overmuch pressure on the
side of costs.
Mr. A. E. Woodward, appearing
before the Commission for the Attorney-
General, concluded:
“Clearly, if the Commission were to
find that economic capacity will allow
for any increase, then, in the Common-
wealth’s submission, this should not be
other than small.”
Following on this, the employers’ less-
reasoned submission that only definable
increases in national productivity should
be reflected annually in general wage
increases could not but help seem less
persuasive, if as valid at heart. In the
process, counsel implied that the Com-
mission has substantial control over
the actual level of wages in Australia.
But with a substantial number of work-
ers receiving over-award payment from
employers, this is obviously not so.
According to an article in the “Per-
sonnel Practice Bulletin” reviewing the
results of a survey carried out here, by
far the majority of chief executives
judged employee earnings as the most
important employee consideration in
any job. The inference is clear enough.
In a climate of full-employment and
tight labor markets, labor turnover is
high and the employers are prone to
tackle the problem solely on the basis
of over-awards; such a situation adds
still further to the upwards push on
prices, while the attitudes which give
rise to it imply that, as well as wages
rising too quickly, productivity is rising
not nearly as rapidly as it could.
The. concept that straight income is
not the primary aspect people see in
their work and, therefore, neither the
key to labor problems nor increased
productivity has been proven for years
whether the majority of employers
care to recognise the fact or not. The
importance of other factors such as
good working conditions and amenities,
good administration and inter-staff
Prices follow wages and productivity
takes care of itself
relationships, delegation of responsibili-
ties, freedom to exercise discretion, the
full use of skills, and many others have
been demonstrated time and again
within individual and enlightened firms.
Such short-sightedness on the part
of many employers here does not de-
tract one jot from the very real faults
existing in the Arbitration System
which they are seeking to improve on.
But until the Commonwealth moves
they could well achieve more success
in bringing the learned justices of the
Commission around to their way of
thinking if they were a bit more
aware or a good deal franker about
their own, very relevant inadequacies.
GOVERNMENT QUANDARY
COMMONWEALTH TREASURY
officials are having some trouble in
providing the Arbitration Commission
with a definition of what they mean
by price stability. The Government’s
counsel was asked by Mr. Moore of
the Commission to provide them with
an answer since their case for a pro-
ductivity-geared wages policy rests
heavily on their claim that anything
else will be inflationary.
They are in considerable trouble,
however. A simple definition of price
stability which speaks of stability in the
consumer price index cannot be put as
an overriding objective of Government
policy. After all, the Commonwealth
itself recently increased a range of
sales taxes and, arising out of that, prices
will rise and the consumer price index
will go up. Similarly, when the terms
of trade move against us and foreign
countries put their prices up, the index
rises and there is nothing anyone can
do about it.
Some inflation, too, is due to de-
mand pressures, reflecting shortages and
a process of prices being bid up, some-
times via payment of over-award wage
rates in the competition for scarce
labor. The Commonwealth will find it
hard to argue, therefore, that by price
stability it .means absolute constancy
in the price index.
Absolute constancy of prices isn’t, of
course, a requirement for maintaining


the competitive position of export in-
dustries in their international markets.
It is enough that prices should not rise
by more here than they do in the
markets in which we sell, and they
generally have a degree of inflation
also.
The Commission would probably like
the Government to give it a figure,
saying for instance that the community
suffers when inflation is such that
prices are rising at more than 2 per-
cent a year. The Commission could
then claim to satisfy the Government
fully by granting an increase which
would consist of a productivity estimate
plus two percent.
What the Government wants is that
the Arbitration Commission should
stick fairly rigidly to productivity alone
as a guide to its wage grant. This
way there would be no wage-cost
pressures on prices, no inflationary
pressure originating from this source.
The trouble is that there are bound to
be other factors. At present it would
be unrealistic to argue there wouldn’t
be any price increases without it. And
in that case workers tied down to
award wages would see a gradual
erosion of the value of their pay if
there was a rigid adherence to the pro-
ductivity rule.
The Commonwealth has three broad
courses open to it now. It can argue
that the Commission should stick less
than rigidly to the productivity
estimate, tending to let any errors fall
on the high side to protect workers
from demand or import induced in-
flation. Or else it can say that a great
variety of people will lose a bit by
such creeping inflation and that there
is no reason why the mass of trade
unionists should be given immunity
when pensioners and others on fixed in-
come have no such guarantee. Thirdly,
it can say bluntly that there is nothing
inequitable about a shift of income
toward companies, that the equity in
companies is owned by a great variety
of people in different circumstances, and
furthermore that profits are a main
source of reinvestment finance and that
they are, therefore, contributing to-
economic growth. This argument would
proceed with an assertion that any re-
gressive income redistribution which
might result would best be countered by
Government taxation and social service
policies, not by Arbitration Commission
action.
The third argument is probably the
best one, but it would be unlikely to
wash with the Bench, which would see
it as reducing its role. And there would
be great political difficulties, too, in the
Government admitting it was prepared
to see wages decline as a proportion
of national income. It will probably
choose a mixture of the first two argu-
ments, with emphasis on the second. But
to get productivity-gearing accepted as
a policy it will have to convince the
Commission that wage-cost pressures
are predominant and that any other
sources of inflation are insignificant. It
might have to go so far as to pledge
itself to policies which will keep other
sources of inflation to a minimum.
MEN AND MATTERS
THE FILLY IS “Sportsgirl” by Bardas
out of “Sportsgear.” This Melbourne
garment stable was half a century old
last week. With its offspring’s 14 shops
(10 in Melbourne and four in Sydney)
and its own big factory in Camberwell
(400 workers making, with the staff in
the shops, 600 on the payroll), it is
now the leading proprietary company
in the Australian quality rag trade. Last
year the group’s turnover exceeded $8
million for the first time.
Telling the story was 31-year-old
chairman David Bardas, grandson of the
founder, who started the business in
Carlton after arriving from Russia via
London, where for a while he was in
the same line of country. David, who,
when a boy, was always at the factory,
went to Scotch and then did Law at
Melbourne University, where he got his
Blue for skiing (as he also plays golf
and other things, he’s a sort of natural
for sports gear). He took over from his
Ken Pring
David Bardas
father, who died in 1959 on an export
trip overseas.
There are no women directors as yet
(David emphasises the “yet”), but
women appear to be everywhere else in
the organisation. All the buyers and
merchandising heads are women and
also upward of 70 percent of the
employees all told. This makes good
reading for feminists, yet it has its
problems for the genial general mana-
ger, John Blood. Blood has been in the
rag trade for so long, though, that he
knows how to handle them. Anyway, he
admits to bigger problems, like those of
stocks and of virtually starting from
scratch every six months in this most
hazardous segment of the trade where
fashion and quality are the hallmarks.
Where does Sportsgear go from here?
Certainly not yet into the ranks of
listed public companies. Finance is not
at all a big problem, with its high
reputation keeping the banks happy.
More than that, the family tradition is
too strong to let it go easily into limbo.
Instead, expansion as a proprietary is
the order of the day on all fronts, with
thoughts of establishing more Sportsgirl
shops. Their breeding rate is as prolific
as Gibby’s, and what Geiger’s used to
be. The one in Toorak has spawned a
Young Miss shop, just across the way,
to cope with the St. Catherine’s girls,
who were crowding out their mothers
looking at the big-ticket items in the
adult one. Sportsgirl is also stepping
more firmly into men’s co-ordinates. It
also has plans for further developing
export trade. Whatever the precise
directions, expansion on the retail side
would seem to hold the key.
With his law degree still looking
pretty fresh on his wall, the chairman
contemplates the future without fuss,
but with the resolve that he’s going to
build the business to heights undreamed
of when his grandfather first set foot on
Melbourne soil 50 years ago. Now,
with about half a million garments a
year up his sleeve, just how high cain he
go? One of his brightest ideas is to
establish four seasons in the rag trade
in place of the present two, so that
instead of having “sales” in the off
months of these two seasons the public
would be offered “something new.”
Husbands beware: Mr. Bardas and his
women could be your despair.
WITH NO WISH to be the richest
man in the cemetery, Ken W. Pring
plans to retire at the end of the year
at the age of 55 from his position as
principal Sydney resident partner for
lan Potter and Co.
His aim is to grow grapes on a
property he has bought at Wallacia,
and to experiment on various projects
which he is keeping secret for fear
someone will beat him to them. So he
will be commuting between the vine-
yards and Rose Bay, where he will
still need to spend two to three days
a week looking after his city interests.
A strong opponent of brokers wearing
two hats, Mr. Pring has never joined
any public-company boards; but now
he will be free to do so. Golfing and
surfing will complete the new pattern.
Pring started off in the diplomatic
service, with overseas stints in India,
Chile, and San Francisco, where he was
consul.
His 14 years with lan Potter and
Co. were preceded by seven years as an
executive with the Anglo-Australian
Corporation, the merchant banking
and underwriting group which was
founded by W. S. Robinson and merged
in 1963 with the Australian United
Corporation Ltd., Potter’s merchant
banker.
Pring had been personal assistant to
the legendary Robinson (“The greatest
man I ever came across”) in 1949,
travelling the world with him and meet-
ing people like Bernard Baruch and
Winston Churchill. Pring recalls it as
a fascinating year, and remembers
Robinsori as the finest and most exact-
ing man to work for.

Speculator’s Diary
STILL STANDING ALOOF
FROM
THE MARKETS SHEEP
THE EASIEST way to get rich and
fat is to agree with the market. Just
float along with the tide and all will
be well; jump in and buy when every-
one else is jumping in and buying, and
sell like hell when everyone else is
selling. That is the philosophy that
has made money in the past year or
so for people like Chartists, who simply
follow the buying and selling trends
already created by other buyers and
sellers in the market. The fact that
they have been solidly right and I
was wrong last week when I bucked
the system and decided to buy Oil
Search against the trend has not
dampened my enthusiasm for dis-
agreeing with the market when I think
it is being a bit silly, even though it
is hitting my pocket a bit.
For the realities of a market down-
turn in this day and age must be
faced. These are that the large number
of “technical” traders in Australian
markets means that there is a tendency
for both upswings and downswings to
be exaggerated. A temporary reaction
following months of solid rises can turn
into a thumping fall once the size of
the market drop passes some magical
point on a Chartist’s graph, and the
herds of sellers come baaaing sheepishly
into the market. The trouble is that
these technical people drag in a lot of
nervous holders with them, and the
result is that a host of bargains sud-
denly appears for those people game
enough to take a stand against the
herd.
When you get a combination of tech-
nical sellers and gloomy market rumors,
as happened with Oil Search last week
when the rumor spread that Esso was
going to pull out of Oil Search’s Ini
area altogether after the current well
was completed, because of the explora-
tion costs in the area, instead of com-
pleting the four wells originally planned
(which would have earned it a half
interest in the area), then markets can
collapse. And it does not matter
whether the well has gone through all
its zones of interest or not (although
admittedly the 6200 feet level was none
too encouraging, with salt water in
the hole indicating an open structure).
It was probably the converse of this
situation that encouraged many specu-
lators last week to play follow-the-
leader into the inconsequential Sydney
real-estate developer, Kingsway Ltd.
This stock has been widely rumored to
have secured a nickel lease somewhere,
so the shares jumped from 13 cents
to around 39 cents as their initial rise
of about 10 cents encouraged specula-
tors to pay steadily increasing prices
for the shares. It was the price rise
that attracted them, rather than the
nickel. Anyway, they have since cojne
back to 30 cents.
Anyway, I’ve determined to remain
contrary, even though I must admit
that two of my purchases were more or
less involuntary. Last week, when
things began to get a little weak, I
left two buying orders with my broker
for 50 each of BHP and CRA if they
went under $2O. This he dutifully did,
although had I been watching the
market closer perhaps I could have
managed to buy the BHPs at only
$19.30. But the CRA buy was at an
excellent price. It is a dangerous pro-
cedure, leaving buying bids like this,
as you could end up buying in the
midst of a flood of selling that carries
the shares down a lot further.
This time, I think the system will
work well; last week’s survey by Mel-
bourne broker Robertson Thompson
that forecasts BHP at $3B by 1975 and
the sensible new share issue the direc-
tors announced after I bought the
shares have both given me added con-
fidence. So now I’m holding 200
BHPs altogether. And my feelings about
CRA are that it will come up with a
nickel mine in W.A. when it is good
and proper to do so. This is not the
sort of company that goes off half-
cocked about things like some others in
the business that have an eye directed
more at the market than the drilling
results.
My other purchase was Ampol
Exploration. The new offshore drilling
rig the Wapet group now has operating
only 20 miles from Perth is going to
bring new life to the market standing
of this company. I’m not overwhelmed
about the chances of finding anything
so close to the city; it would be too
good to be true. But, as the rig moves
farther north into those interesting areas
off Barrow Island, these shares should
get a good run.
Sales this week were of TNT, which,
I think, still has a lot of life in it and
which earned me a $250 profit, and
R. and N. Statham, which has been
a disappointment and which cost me
my brokerage. This leaves kitty at
$1348.

BRIEFLY
The CCOnomy .* Australia posted a $3O million trading
deficit for August, with exports at $266.6 million lagging
behind $296.9 million of imports; the first two months
of the 1968-69 year now show a $60.6 million deficit, against
$55.7 million for July-August, 1967 . . . Total motor vehicle
imports dropped back in July, yet Japan’s contribution
remained steady on June levels.
Seasonally adjusted, July’s retail sales rose by a bare
$l.l million to $637.3 million; they were, however, a good
$31.6 million above July last year . . . Finance company
outstandings rose by 19 percent to $2756 million in the
1967-68 year, helped by a very distinct 56 percent growth
in leasing.
Four States have now imposed their own receipt
stamp duty, and continue to breathe fire and water against
Federal tax disbursements.
Australia has resolved to keep the greatest proportion
of its overseas reserves in sterling.
The markets’ It turned out to be a rather mixed
week on Australian share markets, with the mix looking
particularly grim on Wednesday and Thursday morning.
However, late afternoon dealings on Thursday provided
evidence of a turn upward, which was more or less
confirmed on Friday. Nevertheless, there were some
prominent retreats over the week.
Beset by rumors throughout the week and then coping
with news of the issue, BHP managed to advance a net
40 cents, finishing at $22.70.
The bigger metals tended to drift back. Among the
losses were Consolidated Gold, down 50 cents to $8.80;
CRA, down 60 cents to $21.60; Hamersley, down 80 cents
to $13.70, and Western Mining, down 50 cents to $12.60.
Oils looked stronger toward the close, yet on the week
Oil Search fell 18 cents, Timor 12 cents, and Woodside
10 cents.
Most retailers looked fairly sound; Myer, however, shed
34 cents to hit $4.70.
Slater Walker fell a clear $1 to $6.60, and Larke
Consolidated 24 cents to 98 cents.
Some leading equities (Rank and Dunlop, for instance)
went well ahead in London; profit-taking toward the
close tended to trim some of the general advance.
Blue chips certainly headed Wall Street’s rise, yet the
whole list benefited in fairly heavy trading.
Companies: That scourge of BHP, Mr. Albert Shepherd,
laid on the whips at the annual meeting, but most share-
holders will surely be content with the terms of the new
issue—one-for-14 at $3 a share premium; total raisings,
including an issue to staff, will reach $47 million.
Although Mount Isa earned 14 percent less for 1967-68
($10.7 million against $12.5 million), dividend has been
doubled to 20 percent and directors speak of improved
production . . . Nickel pushed Western Mining ahead, more
than doubling profit and yielding a 54.9 percent earning
rate . . . Mineral sands producer Westralian Oil slipped
back, cutting dividend from 20 to 15 percent . . . Tin
miner Renison is bettering its recovery rate.
Longreach Oil’s new offshoot, Longreach Minerals, is to
handle the Pilbara manganese operation and will have
about a 40 percent public shareholding. . . On the refining
side, Boral lost considerable ground, but held a 20 percent
payout on earnings down from $4,651,927 to $4,097,000.
Larke Consolidated drops its biggest single activity by
selling the 70 percent interest in assembler Pressed Metal
Corporation for $2 million to British Leyland, which
previously owned the 30 percent ... A fifth successive
profit lift came to Australian Motor Industries, so
dividend goes from 10 to 12 percent . . . On the up after
an efficiency drive, Dunlop’s earnings jumped 36 percent
and dividend returned to the old 10 percent level.
Electronic Industries has edged the dividend from 7 to
1\ percent on slightly improved earnings . . . Improvement
is a real word for Wormald, whose profit rose by $352,187
to $885,613, allowing dividend to be doubled to 8 percent.
As commonly, textilers appear somewhat uneven . . .
Only lower tax and depreciation gave F and T Industries
(formerly Felt and Textiles) a lift . . . Bruck Mills gave
some ground, yet encouragingly brought dividend from
to \\\ percent by a 2 percent bonus and still highly
covered ... In contrast, Yarra Falls soared, from $282,496
to $530,292, adding 2 percent to the payout to make
6 percent . . . The merged Universal Textiles saw sales and
profits nicely ahead to help hold a steady 13 percent.
The retailers might well have felt nervous with Myer’s
advance notice of reduced profits for 1967-68, due
principally to higher tax; still, the dividend’s twice covered
... A big boom resounded, however, from Waltons, which
has expanded earnings by 55 percent . . . David Jones
jumped the tax hurdle to show a 5.2 percent profit rise.
For brewers, Victoria’s Carlton and United preserved the
breath of prosperity on a small profit retreat and a
healthily backed 13 percent . . . Ice-cream-maker Petersville,
perhaps surprisingly, went up from $1,565,478 to $1,678,971
despite 50 percent more tax.
Pastoral leader Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort had to
bear with Nature, as drought caused a percent profit
fall to $5,420,535 . . . Part pastoralist and now thriving
developer, Hooker Corporation appears on the dividend
list again with a happy 6 percent after a 25.3 percent
leap in profit for 1967-68; here the pastoral division is the
remaining loss element, but expects a break-even 1968-69 . . .
Developer Stocks and Holdings sprang from $711,133 to
$876,000 and to a 52 percent earning rate.

THE LAND
It’s still a long, long way
for Tipperary
ATTEMPTS IN the past 25 years to
achieve maximum economies of scale in
agriculture by overseas corporations,
government and private, in the wide-
open spaces of Australia and Africa
have met with more disasters than
triumphs. In particular, huge sums
were lost in the various schemes of the
U.K. Overseas Food Corporation and
the Colonial Development Corporation
in these two continents. The British
Government at least learnt the lesson
from them to get out of the business for
good. As for private entrepreneurs,
one cannot be all that certain. Report
has it that somebody in Western Aus-
tralia is offering one and a half million
acres at just over two dollars an acre of
good W.A. development land on the
British market and finding a few takers.
In the meantime, American investors
have gone in, boots and all, at Tip-
perary Station in the Northern Terri-
tory and come out of their first year
there with their boots very wet, cer-
tainly, but spirits undaunted.
Mr. Arthur Edgar, Tipperary’s man-
aging director, has been whistling hard
and often in the southern States in the
past couple of months, if not to help his
courage, then anyway to convince the
nation as a whole that he has the
ingredients for successful large-scale
agricultural development in Northern
Australia. Speaking at a CEDA
seminar last week in Melbourne, he
gave a further avowal of his faith:
'‘The Tipperary agriculture scheme was
designed to demonstrate a system of
crop production capable of attaining,
for the first time in the history of the
world, economies of scale and, in doing
so, to make available to the man on the
land in Australia a practicable means
of overcoming world hunger. The
advantages of success in this joint
endeavor are apparent. The underlying
principles upon which this joint
endeavor is predicated may be less
obvious.”
What are these principles? Mr.
Edgar proceeded: “In industry, in min-
ing, in transportation, and all businesses
other than crop production, man has
been able to take advantage fully of
science, engineering, and chemistry, as
well as the aggregation of other capi-
tal resources, to accomplish large-
scale production on a profitable basis.
The result is improvement of labor
conditions, wider availability of goods
at a reasonable cost, and lifting of the
standard of living for all concerned.
On the other hand, and in sharp con-
trast to methods accepted in other
businesses, the farmer has been ham-
pered by the concept of a ‘family-sized
farm’ in a ‘living area’ as the unit of
production. This is not new. This
constricting idea has existed from
earliest times to the present day. The
result has been to keep the farmer
seasonally under-employed and to deny
to him a large enough area of land to
sustain full utilisation of large-scale
mechanisation and other labor-saving
practices which modern science and
technology can provide.”
As, in the opinion of the manage-
ment, the conditions were right at
Tipperary for the large-scale operations
intended, and if, in fact, it has not
thus far been waterproof, the economies
of the project as explained by Mr.
Edgar certainly look unexceptional, at
least on paper. According to him, the
big equipment being used, such as
eight-row tractors, is efficient and ex-
tends the ability of an individual to
produce only if the land area being
worked is large enough to accommodate
the size of the equipment. If the rows
are too short, more time is consumed
in turning than in ploughing and plant-
ing. As row lengths are decreased, the
size of the equipment must be reduced
successively and the productivity of the
worker shrinks in ratio to the lowered
capacity of the machinery he com-
mands. Conversely, as row lengths in-
crease, the ability to work bigger and
more efficient equipment increases.
There is, accordingly, a direct correla-
tion between the size of a farming block
and the farmer’s ability to take advan-
tage of technological advances.
As he sees it, the ecology of the
tropical region of the Northern
Territory further extends the dimen-
sions of the economies of scale. Double
cropping and triple cropping that
is, the production of more than one
crop from the same tract of land in
a single 12-month period are possible
in an environment where frosts do not
occur and water in reliable and
adequate quantities is available from
rain or irrigation, or a combination of
both. When the types of crops are
varied in a system of double and triple
cropping, so that the periods of plant-
ing and harvesting of the different
varieties are scheduled in an orderly
sequence, then the full economies of
scale are realised. The expense of the
equipment is spread over a full work
year. The farmer’s time and talents are
not diluted through seasonal under-
employment. The fmd result of this
system, he believes, should be a fair
return for the labor of the man on the

land and a fair return on the capital
he invests in land equipment. The
returns to labor and capital should be
commensurate with comparable skills
and resources employed in industry and
trade and the professions.
But the fact remains, like the
disastrous experiments of the OFC and
the CDC, that Tipperary has made a
dreadful start. Operations began in
April last year, and the first year saw
12,000 acres of sorghum planted last
December and January. The crop
matured by April and everything
appeared to be going nicely until the
following month, when unprecedented
rainfall for the area at that time of the
year caused a substantial reduction in
the yield and deterioration in quality.
Mr. Edgar is adamant that this
doesn’t damn the scheme. Neither, he
assures us, is it going to deter the
management from going into the
second round full of fight on the same
broad canvas.
AGRISEARCH
MULTIPLYING PROTEINS
THE OVERWHELMING threat of
widespread famine frequently obscures
the fact of almost universal malnu-
trition. Alarmed at the grave deficien-
cies in the diet of Indian children, the
Director-General of India’s health
services convinced his Government that
until successful efforts were made to
combat malnutrition, two-thirds of the
nation’s children will grow up suffering
irreparable physical and mental retar-
dation. The health-service report points
out that “the cost of counteracting
malnutrition by raising the nutritional
levels of children is far less than either
the cost of the resultant decrease in
productivity or the cost of treating
malnutrition.” Hard-headed Western
observers, such as Professor Gunnar
Myrdal, have often claimed that with-
out any technical innovations and even
without any further investment, except
in the form of longer and more
efficiently applied labor, agricultural
yields would be raised substantially.
But the underlying problem is that hard
and intelligent work cannot be supplied
by the physically and mentally weak.
A great campaign is now under way,
therefore, to give the children a proper
diet. Basically, this means giving them
a higher protein diet. Several steps
are being taken. One involves distribu-
ting among 25 million schoolchildren
of a daily ration of a new protein food
known as Balahar. Also being imple-
mented is a plan to bake 100 million
loaves a year of lysine-fortified bread.
Some of this bread, too, will be dis-
tributed through the school lunch pro-
grams. Australia can be proud to be
behind this remedial measure, which is
off to a flying start in the teeming,
impoverished city of Bombay.
Lysine may be regarded as a protein
multiplier. It is one of the essential
amino acids and when deficient in the
diet the body cannot use the other
amino acids present to build protein,
of which muscle and brain tissue largely
consist. Cereals are low in lysine but
contain considerable amounts of the
other 20-odd amino acids which go
to waste when a person is on a pre-
dominantly cereal diet. Fortunately,
lysine can be manufactured artificially
at a relatively low cost. The main prac-
tical problem is mixing it uniformly
into flour. Australia and Canada, which
have given India modest shipments of
wheat in recent years, have also given
the Indians something that is much
more helpful. For a relatively small out-
lay they have provided the equipment
to set up some 15 bakeries for making
lysine-enriched bread. The first of these
is now in service, and, if current
schedules continue, the aim of ICO mil-
lion loaves a year w r ill be achieved. This
is the largest lysine-enrichment scheme
in the world and will, no doubt, be
copied in other mal-fed countries in
Asia, Africa, and South America.
Indeed, it would be very sensible if
gifts of grain were always accompanied
with a lysine supplement and suitable
mixing plant.
Despite past failures to get people to
accept new foods immediately, this
bread has been a sellout. The shelves
are always empty by noon in the Gov-
ernment milk booths, where this par-
ticular bread is sold at the same price
as ordinary bread. It was ushered on
to the retail market with Western-style
advertising and energetic promotion,
including slick packaging and brand
names. (Many Indians and other
Asians are beginning to regard anything
Western as superior.) The bread is pre-
sliced, and people who can’t afford
a whole loaf buy it by the slice.
Until this movement started, bread
in India was strictly a middle-class
commodity, and therefore eaten regu-
larly by only 1 to 2 percent of the
population. Now an increasing number
of private firms, led by India’s biggest
baking firm, Britania, are making
lysine-fortified breads and biscuits.
Dr. J. R. Vickery, chief—until his
recent, retirement —of the CSIRO
Division of Food Preservation, has
pointed out that Australian and New
Zealand abattoirs produce blood
equivalent to about 35,000 tons of the
dried product annually. At present it
is processed into fertiliser and various
animal feedstuffs. But blood is especi-
ally rich in high-quality proteins, and
could be converted into human food,
thereby adding to the world’s edible
protein supplies.
Incidentally, anyone seriously inter-
ested in foreign aid and the problems
of the under-developed countries will
be well rewarded by reading Gunnar
Myrdal’s book, “Asian Drama: An
Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations.”
It is a massive work stretching into
three volumes and is certain to be in-
voked in any argument or discussion
about the problems of Asia. It is not
a very optimistic book, but this Swedish
economist is not entirely without hope.

INVESTMENT
The Markets
WHATS GOOD FOR BHP
IS NOT GOOD
FOR THE STOCKMARKET
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
GOOD NEWS? BHP’s benevolent new
share issue at a modest premium of
only $3 and at the comfortable rate of
1 for 14 (that should enable most
holders to take up their entitlements)
is certainly good for its shareholders.
But it may not be so good for the
market as a whole. This may sound
heretical in a country where the
proposition has usually gone that what
is good for the BHP is good for the
stockmarket. But in recent times BHP
has moved independently of the bulk
of industrial shares; its strange bouncing
around last week from $22 down to
$19.30 and back to $22 again (as the
stockmarket gave a neat demonstration
of how vulnerable it is to rumor and
how nervous it is of the prospect of
bad news) had no impact at all on the
rest of the industrial market.
In any event, even though the BHP
new issue cheered up BHP holders and
should provide a good rights market,
the fact remains that draining $47
million out of the stockmarket at a
time when internal liquidity is likely
to get tighter and when last year’s
remarkable inflow of portfolio invest-
ment has slowed down to a trickle, will
be a depressing factor on the market
as a whole. This BHP issue means that
a total of about $l2O million is soon to
be reefed out of the market in public
share or debenture issues, quite apart
from any private issues. And this follows
a staggering amount of money raised
in new issues of one kind or another
in 1967-68; these probably got up
around the $450 million mark (coinci-
dentally just about offsetting all the
U.K. portfolio inflow last year) com-
pared with only $126 million in the
previous year.
So 1968-69 is clearly going to be a
year in which the market is going to
be under considerable pressure to pro-
vide new cash for companies at the
same time as the supply of cash is
diminishing. It may be just as well for
the market that Australian industrial
spending on new plant and equipment
is not expected to proceed much faster
this year than last year’s rate of 2 per-
cent, otherwise the demand pressure on
the supply of money would have
become intolerable.
BHP’s issue, Australia’s biggest ever,
is probably not the last major capital
raising that will come this year. But
it has an added significance in that it
is one of those stocks with substantial
numbers of shares in overseas hands,
so that there may be a quantity of
forced selling during rights trading
from foreign holders unable to take
them up for various reasons. This, too,
will divert some funds out of normal
market activities.
This becomes even more significant
in the context of several other new
share issues already announced by com-
panies with substantial overseas share-
holders. For instance, ACI is raising
$lB million, Broken Hill South another
$l5 million, Slater Walker about $lO
million, and TNT about s2f million.
And this issue is by no means the
end of BHP’s approaches to the mar-
ket (although it seems unlikely that
the company will be repeating this
year’s performance in raising $B7 mil-
lion (in April’s $4O million debenture
issue and November’s $47 million share
issue) in only eight months. The
volume of expenditure needed to
develop its existing Bass Strait oil and
gas discoveries clearly shows that BHP
will be regularly coming back to the
market until its oil and gas cash flow
begins to build up strongly in 1971.
And if it discovers even further oil and
gas fields (which seems very likely), it
will clearly be needing even greater
amounts of cash for development.
But the rewards for all this struggle
are not so far away; by the early 19705,
the combination of profits from Bass
Strait and from Mt. Newman iron ore
should kick BHP’s earnings and divi-
dend along at a great rate.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: AMI was first recommended in August, 1966,
when prices were around the 48c level and it had technical appeal as a promising
recovery situation. Prices have continued to move in an upward trend, although
at times wide fluctuations have been evident. The market action
over the past week suggests the probability of a short-term
move to approximately $1.60, and the overall picture indicates
a further target of at least $2. The past chart history shows
that it is capable of holding very steep intermediate trends and
at a very attractive rate of appreciation for investors. Last sale
price on 5/9/68 —$1.37.
FARLEY AND LEWERS
THINK PINK FOR GROWTH
THE “THINK PINK” group Farley
and Lewers must be making Pioneer
Concrete Services, which tried to take
it over four years ago, blue with regret
or green with envy. Farley’s profit
doubled this latest year, and it has mul-
tiplied profits five times since rejecting
the offer. Shareholders got a one-for-
two bonus last March, so that their
income has gone up in effect from 15
percent to 16£ percent, although the
dividend rate on enlarged capital was
cut back to 11 percent.
Pioneer participates in some of this,
however, because it kept its 10 percent
holding acquired in 1965. But the
result of these profit rises is that
Farley and Lewers’ shares are on a
lower yield than Pioneer’s, whose result
for the year is usually announced in
early October.
Farley’s 1965 association with Esso
Standard ' Oil (whereby it supplies
aggregate and sand for Esso’s hot-mix
operations on a long-term agreement,
and Esso holds 10J percent of Farley’s
capital) and last year’s link with CSR

Acquisition or establishment of five

brought this phenomenal growth. These
plants account for a very large propor-
tion of the company’s production of
coarse and fine aggregates.
FOWLER-NEWOLD
BATTLE NOT OVER
THE CHAIRMAN of R. Fowler, Mr.
Raymont Moore, has won the first
round of his battle with Doulton Pot-
teries by arranging a bid by Newbold
General Refractories, but he may yet
lose the battle for the sanitaryware
market.
When the Doulton move was first
announced, that company spoke of ex-
tensive rationalisation and development,
and the introduction of advanced tech-
nology. No doubt it will still be using
the advanced technology, but it looks
as if it will have to establish its own
Melbourne plant, and its old British
competitor, Twyfords Ltd., is now plan-
ning to set up there.
A chairman and two directors in
common was virtually the only link
between Newbold and Fowler. Newbold
executives were invited to investigate
Fowler as a takeover prospect.
Mr. Moore is no stranger to takeover
battles; from his chair at James Sted-
man, he won a fight for Floadleys after
Life Savers made the original offer.
Now the enlarged sweets and chocolate
business have announced profit of
$696,000, which is a good deal down on
a total $900,000 for 1967 for the two
groups. While blaming the fall on to
higher sugar prices, labor costs, and
distribution expenses, there is no get-
ting away from the reduction in earning
rate from 23.9 to 19.4 percent.
WATTS' PREMIUM
ON THE BIG SIDE?
IT IS TIMELY financing when a com-
pany manages to get all the under-
writing done to announce a new issue
within a cent or two of its shares’
highest price for years and after a
more than 50 percent rise in the past
six months. This is what E. A. Watts
managed to do last week with its one-
for-five issue at 65 cents premium on
its 50-centers, an issue calculated to
raise just on $600,000 and underwritten
by A. C. Goode and Co. The question
is, however, whether the 130 percent
premium isn’t overdoing it a bit, even
with the Goode tag on the issue. For
these shares, not so many months ago,
were as low as $1.20, at which time
they attracted our attention (and also
that of a lot of other people) for a
number of reasons. Between then and
the new issue announcement, they’d
climbed up 70 cents to $1.90, at which
price they still offered a dividend yield
of 5.4 percent on the 12 percent rate,
which was covered about 3.5 times by
earnings, a slight improvement, in the
year just passed.
Earlier suggestions that E. A. Watts
and A. V. Jennings .might get together
in some closer association now that
Jennings is going in for the big jobs
that are a Watts specialty, have as yet
come to nothing, and if it turns out
that something isn’t on in this direction
(there have been no denials, however)
some buyers on merger account could
well get, out of their shares. Even so
the current price of $l.BO (they’ve
slipped back a bit since the new issue
was announced) seems very well justi-
fied as earnings are still moving up,
albeit a bit too slowly for some people’s
liking, and the company is full of work
with $4B million uncompleted contracts
on the books and more coming in
every week. The company has just
landed two new contracts worth a total
of $4 million for the new V.A.C.C.
building in Melbourne and a new fac-
tory in Burwood, intriguingly close to
the A. V. Jennings HQ.

STAID, SOLID IMAGE
ALL THE SIGNS point to tightening
liquidity in the banking system this
financial year. And if this is not
brought about naturally by the balance-
of-payments deficit that looks inevit-
able, then there is every prospect that
the Reserve Bank may well act to bring
it about. Its reason would be to take
enough steam out of the economy to
prevent demand over-flowing into im-
ports (and so worsening the balance of
payments even more). If bank lending
gets a bit tighter, and money gets in
shorter supply, where is this going to
leave the finance companies?
In the good old days, the Reserve
Bank’s tighter .money crusades used to
be manna from heaven for the finance
companies, as the banks were physically
restricted from lending while the
finance companies were only asked to
be good boys and not lend too much.
The result was that tight credit situa-

tions moved lots of excellent borrowers
out of the banks (who were prevented
from serving them) and into the hire-
purchase companies, at higher rates of
interest. And so the hire-purchase com-
panies’ profits soared, even though the
money they were lending often cost
them a bit more to get.
Will the same thing happen now?
This time around, the Reserve Bank
is likely to play it a little better,
although the extent of the restraint likely
this year is only going to be a fraction
of that of the early ’sixties. Simply
mucking about with the banks’ ability
to lend by changing their SRD ratios
may not appeal so much these days
as using interest rates as a weapon,
particularly now that the finance com-
panies face so many competitors for
short-term funds. And with conven-
tional hire-purchase business now repre-
senting a steadily diminishing propor-
tion of finance companies’ turnover,
interest rates are of increasing impor-
tance to their ability to do profitable
business.
With the main limits on finance-
company business being their supply of
funds rather than the supply of cus-
tomers wanting to use them, it seems
likely that a. slight tightening of the
money screws may no longer be the
good thing for finance-company profits
at the expense of the banks as it used
to be. This is especially so now that
the banks are allowed to compete in
the finance-companies’ fields of per-
sonal, bridging, and short-term real
estate loans at higher interest rates than
overdraft rate; perhaps tighter credit
conditions could even see the banks
putting larger proportions of their ad-
vances into these more renumerative
fields to make up for the impact on
their profits of tighter liquidity.
In any event, the intrusion of trad-
ing bankers into fields traditionally the
preserve of hire-purchase financiers
raises the question whether Australian
banks will allow their finance affiliates
to remain independent or whether, like
the Commercial Bank of Australia,
which recently acquired its only
moderately successful associate, General
Credits, there will be a round of take-
overs. The Mutual Acceptance Co.
Ltd., being owned 40 percent by the
Chartered Bank of London, is not sub-
ject to this speculative prospect.
But its future looks sound, neverthe-
less, although it has faced strong com-
petition within and without the industry
in the last couple of years, in both
borrowing and lending. Industrial
borrowers going direct to the market
absorbed more of the funds available
for fixed-interest investment, and the
Australian Resources Development
Bank is also providing some competi-
tion. And the $lOO million or so
to be raised on public issues of one
kind or another in coming months will
absorb a lot of the cash that may other-
wise have found its way to the finance

consciously diversified, and that except
for the financing of domestic appliances
on hire purchase its numerous activities
have been ignored in the past by Press
and the stock market. It says it has
always carried the same range of finance
facilities as all other bank-backed
financiers.
But the breakdown of net receivables
in the last year certainly shows a dis-
tinct trend away from hire-purchase
contracts (down from 34.7 to 29.9 per-
cent) and into lease receivables (up
from 16.4 to 20 percent). There was
little relative change in real-estate
mortgages (43.5 percent compared with
43.2 percent in 1967), and “other
advances” rose marginally from 5.7 to
6.6 percent.
The growth is still there in hire
purchase, although the percentage may
fall, as the bridging, leasing, and
mortgage business develops. These
developments are having an impact on
the length of contracts; in the past
four years income yet to mature has
jumped by 80 percent, even though
amounts receivable have risen by only
46 percent, suggesting a lengthening of
average terms.
Mutual Acceptance’s participation in
new developments in the finance indus-
try includes its 15 percent shareholding
In the Sydney merchant banker, Martin
Corporation.
Tighter credit conditions usually
bring an increase in the quality of
finance-company customers (as they
fail to get what they need from
bankers) and so a lower level of bad
debts. But apart from this the bad-
debts situations experienced around the
beginning of this decade has much im-
proved. People use their credit more
wisely now, yet are not as heavily com-
mitted as Americans. In 1966-67 Aus-
tralians used 7.8 percent of their
personal disposable income on instal-
ment credit repayments, compared with
14.5 percent in America. At the same
time as Australians owed $123 per head
on instalment credit, they had $506
in savings-bank deposits.
Amounts advanced by all Australian
financiers in consumer and commercial
credit, including lease funds in the past
year to June, rose 19.2 percent. This
reflected continued recovery in demand
for motor vehicles, the growth in use
of lease finance by industry, for plant
and equipment, and the expansion of
personal loans, according to the Aus-
tralian Finance Conference, the national
association of non-retailer finance com-
panies.
Mutual Acceptance did a little worse
than the industry average, as its gross
and net receivables were both up by 15
percent. But profit improved by 22
percent, better than most of its rivals.
The profit result gives nearly double
cover for the 12 percent dividend now
paid for two years, since the reduction
from 15 percent. But a return to 15
percent is by no means imminent. The
Chartered may be content to receive


12 percent dividends (an 8 percent re-
turn on its investment) without in-
fluencing Mutual Acceptance to pay
higher, irrespective of the British
Government’s wish for a greater inflow
of funds. But a dividend rise is always
a possibility.
According to Mutual Acceptance, the
association with The Chartered Bank
has been indispensable in adding some-
thing to the company’s image for
borrowing more advantageously, as
well as invaluable because of its direct
experience in finance round the world,
and its position within the British bank-
ing system, which has a broader outlook
than the Australian.
Income yet to mature on accounts
due and to mature under hire-purchase,
mortgage and other contracts of $58.5
million was $12.4 million, compared
with $53.9 million and $ll million in
1967. The balance due on equipment
leasing contracts rose from $11.6 to
$16.1 million, subject to unearned leas-
ing income of $2.8 million (1967 $2.1
million).
The company’s cash position was im-
proved at 1968 balance date, but this
may not have been very significant. The
ratio of receivables due within two
years to liabilities due within two years
was somewhat less than usual, at 1.9 to
1, compared with 2.5 to 1 two years
earlier.
The company’s objectives are for
post-tax earnings to be around 2 per-
cent of assets engaged, profit before tax
and interest around 9 percent of assets
engaged, and borrowed funds up to
5| times shareholders’ funds.
Shareholders have had no benefits
since a hefty three-for-five par issue in
June, 1958. With the cut in their in-
come two years ago, anyone buying
within the last ten years has seen no
capital or income growth. The com-
pany is well within the limitations of
its trust deed (that total liabilities may
be no more than seven times share-
holders’ funds, and total debentures no
more than 60 percent of liquid assets
including income yet to mature), so
there is no pressure for a share issue
from this source.

probably limited to those who look for
moderate income and security, and the
chance to pick up a little in market
value, as the shares move within fairly
well-defined limits. With the shares
currently at their best level for four
years, while market interest focuses on
financiers as the first reporters in the
new financial year, there may be better
times to buy this stock than now. But
it looks a sound long-term proposition.
Mining
PUTTING A PROPER
VALUE ON
BOUGAINVILLE COPPER
DESPITE SOME last-minute attempts
in the Press to drum up interest, little
evidence of speculation surrounded the
issue of Conzinc Riotinto’s interim
report. Since the announcements on
nickel finds in the Widgiemooltha-
Higginsville area earlier in the year,
CRA’s chairman, Sir Maurice
Mawby, had dropped some pretty broad
hints that he would be in a position to
say something about reserves in the
latest report, but speculators did not
take the bait. After a modest rise to a
peak of $24.10, the shares had eased to
$21.60 by the end of last week, while
CRA’s partner in both the nickel
prospect and the Bougainville copper
deposits, New Broken Hill, peaked after
the report at $20.50 and stood at $lB.BO
at the end of last week.
Speculators, perhaps, are beginning
to appreciate that the development of
mineral deposits is a very long-term
affair. Of course, if the rumor that
reserves on the nickel leases had been
proved at 80 million tons of high-grade
ore had been correct, a very substantial
rise in share value might have been
expected. But, for a start, in these
more conservative days, rumors involv-
ing ore deposits of such magnitude
overstep the bounds of credibility. And
even were such a rumor founded in
some fact, the experience of last May
has taught that such juicy pronounce-
ments are not left to the junior partners
of the CRA-New BH-Anaconda con-
sortium.
For Bougainville, Sir Maurice had
some splendid reserve figures to dis-
close, lifting the copper deposits from
230 million to 500 million tons of 0.51
percent ore, and adding 400 million
tons of lower-grade ore as a bonus.
And if the market did not get at all
excited about such figures, it could well
be that the already massive but unex-
ploited deposits had quite simply be-
come somewhat more massive.
Although neither company’s shares
showed any particular signs of weak-
ness after the so-called “disappoint-
ment” of CRA’s report, it was New BH
which showed the greatest resilience of
the two, though marginally. The full
long-term prospect of Bougainville is
obviously not yet accounted into the
share price of either company as yet,
but the far greater benefits it will
eventually bring to the shares of New
BH were possibly already apparent as
an extra steadying influence.
New BH has a third interest in
Bougainville compared with CRA’s
two-thirds interest. But New BH is rep-
resented by only 14.5 million shares
compared with 79.5 million for CRA.
From this basis the theoretical income
of $l2O million a year from Bougain-
ville would be roughly divided into $3
for each New BH share and $1 for
each of CRA. The same leverage over
CRA applies to whatever nickel pro-
duction may eventuate in the Widgie-
mooltha-Higginsville area. There, the
division of interests is 60 percent
Anaconda, 26 2-3rd percent CRA, and
13 l-3rd percent New BH, giving each
New BH share roughly three times the
profit leverage over each CRA share
again.
If CRA’s long-term prospects are im-
pressive, those for New BH are spec-
tacular; and should either or both of
the nickel and copper prospects be
fully realised, the share price of New
BH must be expected to eventually
settle at not less than twice that of
CRA, despite .the latter’s other massive
interests in iron ore and aluminium.
MINERAL SECURITIES and Pet-
roleum Securities, managed by Kenneth
McMahon and Partners, should again
earn very well on capital this year,
even though these speculative markets
do not look as bullish to date as they
did in the past 12 months.
Their good prospects are because
their portfolios have grown enormously
in size. The 1968 accounts showed book
value of Mineral Securities’ investments
to have quadrupled, and market value
to have multiplied six times in 12
months.
Petroleum Securities, which operated
for only seven months to June 30, 1968,
lifted capital 50 percent with an issue
dated from the first day of the current
financial year, although the new shares
were eligible for the maiden 4 percent
dividend, payable from profit, which on
an annual basis represented 94 percent
on ranking capital.
Mineral Securities earning rate was
166 percent on average dividend rank-
ing capital, and 144 percent on final
capital, so the 9-| percent dividend was
modest, indeed.
Mineral Securities estimated its net
tangible asset backing per 50c share at
$5.11, on the basis of the market value
of its listed investments. But in doing
so it took only the flow-through on its
Petroleum Securities shares, that is 95c,
which was the asset backing calculated
on market value of Petroleum Securi-
ties portfolio, and not the $2.80, which


Finance Corporation
of Australia Limited
INCORPORATED IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Chairman's Address at the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,
held on Tuesday, 3rd September, 1968
MR R. S. TURNER
The net profit of the F.C.A. Group for
the year ended 30th June, 1 968, as has
already been disclosed to shareholders
in the Statement of Profit circulated
with the Balance Sheet and Directors'
Report, was $1,536,1 92, after providing
$1,279,861 for Income Tax, $87,911
for Depreciation and $lOO,OOO for
Contingencies and Doubtful Debts.
Once again this is a record profit, being
$103,006, or 7.1% higher than the
result for the year ended 30th June,
1967.
Tax has been provided at new rates
announced by the Federal Treasurer
in the 1968 Budget. (If rates of tax
on companies had been unchanged,
the provision for tax would have been
$72,116 less, and the net profit would
have been 12.2% above that of 1966/67.
The earning rate on average capital
would have been 19.2%.)
Net outstandings at 30th June, 1968
an important indicator of the expected
profitability of the current year, were
$95,269,951. This was $18,087,353
or 23.43% higher than the correspond-
ing figure a year earlier. Unearned
income of $42,932,464 —35.44% of
gross outstandings to which it relates
—was deducted in calculating the net
outstandings.
Loans on the security of real estate
accounted for more than 86% of the
net outstandings, and Leasing trans-
actions represented almost 11%. The
remainder consisted of minor activities
of the Company, including Hire Pur-
chase and Personal Loans.
In the consolidated accounts, Pro-
vision for Contingencies and Doubtful
Debts was increased to $1,100,000 by
the above-mentioned addition of
$lOO,OOO from current earnings—and
deducted from Assets. All bad debts
incurred have been written off in the
year's accounts. The Directors consider
that adequate provision has been made
for possible losses.
Paid up Capital of Finance Corpora-
tion of Australia Limited was increased
during the year by $1,004,725 to
$9,032,225, which includes $32,225
paid up on Employees' Shares. The
consolidated net profit for the year
ended 30th June, 1968 was equal to
18.3% on the average capital paid up
throughout the year.
Reserves and retained profits of
$4,529,622—5773,954 higher than at
30th June, 1967 —are used in the
Companies' businesses, and form part
of the consolidated Shareholders'
Funds of $13,561,847.
In each year since the incorporation
of the parent Company, the dividend
has been maintained at 10% per
annum. This year the payment —
inclusive of the interim dividend paid in
March—will amount to $838,058. The
net profit for the year covered the
dividend 1.8 times.
The Company now has 1,747 share-
holders. Our largest shareholder —The
Bank of Adelaide, which holds 40% of
the Ordinary Capital—has been of great
assistance to the Company.
Our debenture holders numbered
20,449 at 30th June, 1 968, and at that
date $73,039,200 of Debenture Stock
was issued and outstanding—an in-
crease of $9,302,700 over the previous
year. We acknowledge the continued
support of individual and institutional
investors and sharebrokers throughout
Australia in our Debenture issues.
Additional moneys aggregating
$4,284,922 were accepted on deposit
during the year, and at 30th June,
1 968, deposits aggregated
$15,300,103.
Subscriptions to the current deben-
ture issue already amount to approx-
imately $9,000,000. No difficulty is
being experienced in investing all
available moneys in suitable business
throughout all States.
The sound liquid position of the
Group is exemplified by the holdings
of $5,570,008 at balance date in Bank
Balances, Commonwealth Inscribed
Stock, Debentures and Deposits. Col-
lections from customers currently
approximate $4.5 million per month.
All of the subsidiary companies have
guaranteed repayment of the debenture
stock issued by the parent company,
and have given first floating charges
over their assets in support of their
guarantees.
On the Company's pastoral properties
in the New England district of New
South Wales development is pro-
ceeding. From 19 to 21 inches of rain
have been recorded in 1968, and the
last three months of the calendar year
are normally part of the wet season.
Each of the stations has excellent
potential for cattle breeding, and short-
term and long-term prospects are
favourable in the cattle industry. The
Company's investment in the pastoral
properties, including livestock, repre-
sents approximately 2% of the Group's
total assets.
There has been sustained demand for
the Companies' facilities in all types of
business transacted within the Group,
and outstandings increased in all
States over the year under review.
The Directors have announced the
issue of a further $1,000,000 in
Ordinary Capital, payable in full by
Ist December, 1968. Subject to the
passing today of a Special Resolution
increasing the authorised capital of the
Company, this issue will be offered at
par to shareholders in the proportion of
one new $1 share for every nine
ordinary shares held by them on 9th
October, 1968. The Directors expect
that the dividend rate of 10% per annum
will be maintained on the increased
capital.
Mr. E. P. M. Harty of Melbourne was
appointed an additional Director of the
Company during the year. At today's
meeting, shareholders will be invited to
vote on the re-appointment of Mr.
Harty, and of the two other Directors —
Mr. C. J. Glover and myself—who
retire in conformity with the Articles of
Association of the Company.
The Company has again been well
served by its General Manager, Mr.
K. W. Adcock, the key executives at
Head Office and all Branches, and all
members of the staff. On behalf of
all shareholders and the Directors, I
express our thanks to them for their
efforts which have led to the satisfactory
result which was achieved in the year
under review.

Security analysis
A COLORFUL FUTURE
TO BRING MORE
GROWTH FOR HANIMEX
PEOPLE ARE always asking me to
comment on stocks which, although
underpriced on the market, would give
them plenty of . leverage for future
capital gains. Not an easy task, for I
am no soothsayer, only a plain old
Security Analyst. Looking back on
stocks which I have brought to your
attention in recent months, I was struck
by the market’s consistent underestima-
tion of Hanimex. In my article on this
stock (8., March 23), I described the
company as being much misunderstood,
and lamented that Australians, whether
in the securities industry or in less con-
fused occupations, tend to knock what
they don’t understand. Hanimex Cor-
poration delights in being a noncon-
formist.
When I commented on this stock in
March, the share price was 95 cents;
it later rose to a peak of $1.75, and is
now priced at $1.65 to show a dividend
yield of 6.1 percent. My hunch is that
the company could report a substantial
improvement in profit for ordinary in
the year 1967/68, and my smell is that
the prospects ahead for the current
trading year are very good. I am very
enthusiastic about Hanimex, which has
led to the unusual approach of again
drawing attention to the company so
soon after my original report and still
before the release of the 1967/68
accounts.
I have been doing some homework
on the rates of profitability of interna-
tional companies in photographic
supplies and equipment. The well-
known German photographic magazine
“Derphotomarkt” places Hanimex No.
9 in a list of 30 top-ranking companies
in the international stakes in terms of
profit earned per employee. In this
list Polaroid was No. 1, followed by
GAF, Eastman Kodak, du Pont, 3M,
Honeywell (all from the U.S.A.); then
followed Metz (Germany), Bell &
Howell (U.S.A.), Hanimex, Yashica
(Japan), and 20 others, including Agfa-
Gevaert (Germany), Ilford (U.K.),
Canon, Fuji Photo Film, Minolta,
Olympus, Asahi, Elmo, Ricoh, and
Sankyo (all from Japan).
A survey of six U.S. major photo-
graphic companies revealed some inter-
esting and provoking comparisons when
laid side by side with Hanimex. The
comparisons were for the year ended
1967.

The price/earnings ratio expresses
the number of year’s earnings that the
market is paying for the share based
on its current price; for the U.S. com-
panies the calculations were based on
market quotations at August 20, as
reported in the Wall Street Journal.
This table illustrates clearly to me that
Hanimex is greatly undervalued by the
Australian stock market.
Hanimex is both an Australian and
international marketer of photographic
supplies and equipment, with sales in
Australia being in the vicinity of 50
percent of total turnover. In England,
the company has about 60-70 percent of
the slide-projector market and 20-25
percent of the overall photographic-
equipment market (except film).
Although the English Budget in March,
1968, raised sales tax on photographic
products to 50 percent, I believe that
sales since then have held up very well.
The company’s greatest potential, how-
ever, is in the United States, where a
branch was opened for the first time
in October, 1967—this was in Chicago.
It is understood that the sales trends
from the U.S.A. subsidiary have been
well above expectations and within a
very short period of time it is expected
to become a major contributor to Hani-
mex’s world-wide turnover.
As a major exporter of photographic
supplies and equipment from Australia,
Hanimex is entitled to very generous
export-tax incentives, which, have the
net result of reducing its company-tax
rate from 45 percent (increased by 2|
percent in this year’s Budget) effectively
to less than 10 percent. Another bull
point to take into account is that the
Australian Government has announced
that the company, along with other
Australian export interests, will receive
full compensation for any loss incurred
by the 14 percent devaluation of ster-
ling, which the British Government
imposed in November, 1967. The com-
pensation benefits accrue through to
December, 1968.

year should also materially assist the
company. The Tariff Board in January,
1968, granted Hanimex, as the sole
manufacturer in Australia, tariff pro-
tection on magnetic tape and pre-
recorded magnetic tape. The company’s
current share of the Australian market
for these products is about 10 percent,
but this is expected to be raised to
15-20 percent over the next year, and
the annual market growth is about
15-20 percent. In October, 1967, Hani-
mex commenced to produce 35mm.
negative positive color film for the first
time (color reversal film for slides has
been a company product since 1965),
and in December, 1967, the company
ventured into the lucrative market of
photofinishing; that is in printing and
developing film left by amateur photog-
raphers with their family chemist. I
understand that Hanimex’s sales in
photofinishings are increasing at the
rate of 20 percent a month.
The Australian market for photo-
graphic supplies and equipment, which
showed a growth of 150 percent in the
eight years from 1959 to 1967 (or
almost double the growth in personal
disposable income in Australia), is ex-
pected to expand at a very fast rate
in future years, as Australia follows the
United States in an explosive growth
in amateur use of photographies'.
The biggest money-spinning event in
the United States photo market is in
the use of color film. On a volume
basis, 61 percent of still films bought
by amateurs in the United States in
1966 were in color, which compared
with a figure of only 32 percent in 1957,
and at this rate of growth is expected
to outsell black-and-white film by three-
to-one in 1971.
Demand by amateur photographers
for color film is growing more slowly
in Australia, but the now substantial
sales of low-priced instant-loading
cameras should speed up the rate of
expansion here. Hanimex is well placed
with its range of products to reap a
harvest as market demand accelerates.
At the present time, the company has
about 10 percent of the Australian
photographic film business and about
40 percent of the total Australian
photographic-equipment market (ex-
cluding film).
The interim report released in March,
1968, showed group sales for the half
year to December, 1967, rising to $7,264
million (up 15.7 percent) on the cor-
responding period of 1966, and the
profit for ordinary was $382,440 for the
half year to December, 1967 (up 24
percent on the corresponding period
of the preceding year). The half year’s
earnings as disclosed in the March in-
terim report were at the equivalent
rate of 20 cents a share on an annual
basis. *
Summary: Compared to other stocks
in growth industries, Hanimex is under-
valued on current prices (at $1.65 the
dividend yield is 6.1 percent) and my
tip is that there are good gains ahead.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
When the whistle blows it’s time to swing
PHOTOS BY ROBERT WALKER
The boys relax before recording “swinging side two” under the baton of RAN Director of Music Lt-Cdr. George Hooker
By SANDRA HALL
LIKE MOST OTHER THINGS, mili-
tary bands are much more “with it”
these days, or so Lieutenant-Com-
mander George Hooker, Director of
Music for the Royal Australian Navy,
thinks.
After all, he says, looking over the
list of tracks for the RAN Massed
Bands’ new LP, take the inclusion of
John Antill’s “Corroboree.” Arranged
by an RAN petty-officer, the band’s
version was first performed at the Adel-
aide Festival of Arts earlier this year.
It was really perfect for Adelaide,
since, he says, “we’re all so au fait
with the Aborigines now.”
And if any more proof of the RAN’s
determination to be fashionable were
needed—what about the occasion on
which the band appeared with the
Seekers at the Myer Music Bowl last
February before 200,000 people? In
fact, they are going to record “Georgie
Girl” now on the new LP. Then there’s
their version of Petula Clark’s hit
“Downtown,” all part of “the image
the band is trying to project with
bright, virile music.”
But now Lieut-Commander Hooker,
or George as everybody is calling him
in a casual, nan-naval fashion, has to
get out there in front of the boys in the
recording studio to put down another
track. (“They’re blowing the whistle
on you, George.”)
This is his twelfth LP—the RAN
Massed Bands record one LP a year
for EMI, who say they are in the steady
selling class, between 700 and 1500
copies. One LP has been released by
the World Record Club, another,
“Sounds from the Sea,” is to be released
soon in England.
Eric Dunn, one of EMl’s two Sydney
producers, has been bringing these
records out for the past ten years, a job
made mammoth by the band’s size, 57
musicians. He is chain-smoking, listen-
ing, and watching the control panel
manned by an equally harassed sound
engineer, John Taylor.
Yes, says Dunn, it is a big job. They
started at nine this morning, and they
won’t be stopping for some time yet.
Then there’s another nine-to-five session
tomorrow. But it’s a well-rehearsed band,
and they come prepared. Indeed, they
are prepared, with the kind of naval
precision one might expect. Someone
keeps a steady eye on the metronome
in the corner, someone else has a stop-
watch, and a third man is counting the
bars on a sheet of music and muttering
over the sums he’s working on a scrap
of paper. The aim, I’m told, is strict
march tempo, to be maintained con-
tinuously through the side of' the record
devoted to marches.
Now the trombones start up again.
Through the glass pane, Lieut-
Commander Hooker’s baton mirrors the
metronome’s half-circle, guided by a
man who duplicates the action in the
control-room. The drummer, a cool
youth with a crew-cut, eyes the metro-
nome and chews gum at strict march
tempo. Momentarily, the metronome
is everything.
The musicians, whose average age is
23, have been drawn from the bands of
two naval stations HMAS Penguin
and HMAS Albatross—and from the
carrier HMAS Sydney. Lieut-
Commander Hooker is stationed at the
RAN School of Music, HMAS
Cerberus, in Victoria, but at present
his white shirt and his arms, bent at
the elbow and flapping in strict tempo,
lend him the look of a. busy penguin.
He holds his heart, clenches his fists,
purses his lips. The music, it seems, is
something palpable, to be grabbed from
the air and cradled in a rolling, wave-
like motion. He peers under his spec-
tacles at the metronome, points the
baton at the brass section, stops and
hitches up his trousers. “Shoot the
second trombone player,” someone in
the booth says.
Then they’re off again,' a little more
slowly this time, until Lieut-
Commander' Hooker brings them to a
finish, one hand held up in a Chur-
chillian victory signal. He listens to the
playback in the control-room, where
there’s a moment of indecision about
the split in the trombones. “Can you
hear it? They should be playing in
unison.” But it’s finally resolved. “I’m
prepared to accept it because the whole
thing felt livelier, and we won’t get
that again today.”
It’s 3.30, one side is done, and they’re
feeling pleased with themselves. Out-
side in the studio the boys sit, talk,
and read the sports pages, looking more
jazz than Navy in their open-neck shirts
and sweaters.
Soundproofed partitions divide the
woodwind and percussion from the
brass section, a measure newly intro-
duced to stop the sound disseminating,
before it reaches the microphones.
There’s a set of chromatic tubular bells,
a glockenspiel, a four-octave xylophone
—all the property of one musician—
flutes, bassoons, short E-flat clarinets, a
huge baritone saxophone, and tympani,
euphoniums, and so on. Each musician
is issued with an instrument he’s
expected to treat as his own. Life
expectancy of each instrument is three
years.
Now it’s time for swinging side two,
with its pops and updated versions of
two military favorites —“Our Director,”
in its 1968 guise, “Leader Man Rag,”
and “Under the Double Eagle,” now
seeing life as “Twin Eagle Strut.”
The band runs through “Leader Man
Rag” once—“too slow,” they decide,
“and not enough glock,” so the metro-
nome is set at a faster tempo and they
rehearse again, then record, as Lieut-
Commander Hooker sashays to the hints
of ragtime in it. After that the re-
play, during which everyone in the
booth observes two minutes’ silence and
Lieut-Commander Hooker sits chin in
hands. “I think we overcorrected on


the tempo a bit,” he says at the end,
and they all laugh.
“Yes, but you’ll be loved for it. The
marching girls will go mad over it.”
So they go on —with the up-tempo
metronome and “Twin Eagle Strut,”
while Eric Dunn makes a note about
bracketing on the record cover the old
names of the tracks with the new.
After all, there are the less progressive
fans to consider.
BALLET/CAROLYN SYMES
LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The Australian Ballet Company. Her
Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney.
IF CAPACITY audiences and glowing
notices in Sydney are any gauge, I can
only assume that the Australian Ballet
is more than satisfied with the first
stage of its 1968 season. But I cannot
believe that supporting audiences are
equally happy. In fact, they have every
right to feel neglected, because, in addi-
tion to the restrictions of a booking
system to which they subscribe for fear
of missing out altogether, subscribers
are forced to accept a fait accompli
which not only denies them a choice of
cast but withholds information.
All the evidence seems to point to the
fact that subscribers fortunate enough
to hold tickets for the opening night of
each program can be reasonably
certain of seeing the most-accomplished
principal dancers the company has to
offer. But the rest must wait in ignor-
ance of the casting until arrival at the
theatre on their appointed night. Assur-
ances from the management that sub-
scribers will see each principal at least
once during the season are not, I am
sure, much consolation for a lack of
choice, and because of unforeseen
mishaps can be rendered null and void.
In any ballet company some cast
alternating is necessitated by the physi-
cal demands of ballet. In the Australian
Ballet it is also much used as a means
of speeding up the development of star
potential, which certainly has merit.
Consequently, standards vary from one
performance to another; offsetting this
is the interest of comparing different
dancers’ interpretations.
“Giselle,” the third and last program
of this season, demonstrates my point.
I have never seen a performance of
this ballet which did not rely heavily
on the individual characterisations of
its principal dancers for its complete
interpretation, and this production
carries on that tradition. The Aus-
tralian Ballet’s casting for “Giselle”
alternates no fewer than three princi-
pals in each of the major roles and
two soloists in the minor parts. I think
it is reasonable to suppose that, given
a choice, many subscribers would
prefer to see a different cast from the
one performing on the particular
evening they are to attend. Granted it
may be difficult to organise a change
of ticket, but surely they are entitled
to some advanced notice upon which
they might act.
Peggy van Praagh’s production, which
was first performed in Australia in 1966,
is a restored but charmingly rejuvenated
version of the original Romantic-period
ballet choreographed by Coralli and
Perrot to Adolphe Adam’s music. The
traditional spirit of this famous ballet
has not been altered, but lucid mime
and uncluttered choreography help to
make its sentimental tale of supersti-
tion, built around the Slavonic legend of
the Wilis, a truly touching and almost
feasible story. Kenneth Rowell’s
autumnal and gentle sets and lighting
refreshingly divert from the norm.
On its opening night in Sydney
Marilyn Jones as Giselle offset only a
few minor inconsistencies in her tech-
nique early in Act I with her sensitive
portrayal in seemingly effortless danc-
ing of the naive and joyful peasant girl
blossoming in a new-found love with
Albrecht (Garth Welch). The simplicity
of her reaction to the revelation that
PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT WALKER
Marilyn Jones and Garth Welch —
"Giselle,” Act I
this love, could never be fulfilled made
her tear-jerking mad scene all the more
poignant.
Garth Welch was every bit the in-
fatuated but irresponsible Count in
disguise. The command and vitality of
his movements and his gay, expressive
miming contrasted with the happy but
solid peasant crowd to add depth to
the story and strength to the sincerity
he showed on the tragic death of
Giselle. In both acts they danced
superbly together. But it was in the
spirit world of the mossy graveyard
in Act II that Garth Welch was best
able to reveal his assured technique. As
an exhausted Albrecht he faultlessly
executed the breathtakingly demanding
choreography, and Marilyn Jones was
ethereal perfection. The mood of this
act was enhanced by the Wilis’ cohesive
dancing, which more than adequately
compensated for some patchiness among
almost the same corps de ballet in Act I.
Heather Macrae as Queen of the
Wilis was in command, but her dancing
was overshadowed by one of her head
Wilis, Ann Fraser, whose fluid tech-
nique and sensitive body control have
delighted me throughout this season.
In this production Hilarion, danced
with character by Alan Alder, is not
a sinister suitor but a broken-hearted
young man who in a fit of jealousy
sparks off the series of incidents for
which he pays repentantly with his life.
I didn’t feel that Patricia Cox and
Karl Welander made the most of the
choreography in the Peasant Pas de
deux of Act I, but its inclusion this
season adds more excitement to this
ballet, which overflows with pure clas-
sical dance steps so expertly joined
together they could hardly fail to thrill.
So, by closing its interesting and
colorful, but controversial, 1968 season
with “Giselle” the Australian Ballet is
making sure that our final and probably
most enduring memories of the season
will be sweet, provided the alternating
casts maintain the standards set in the
first performance.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
MADE TO ORDER
Night Must Fall. Emlyn Williams.
Theatre 62, Adelaide.
EMLYN WILLIAMS’ “Night Must
Fall” was written in 1935 and was a
big hit that year. It is the kind of
vintage piece Theatre 62 enjoys present-
ing, and presents well, to an audience
which obviously enjoys seeing plays it
can understand —nothing modern, sor-
did, or confusing.
Williams’ play is nicely, if predict-
ably, constructed, and concerns a
sympathy-seeking, tyrannous old lady
who plays the invalid, her servants who-
are amusing “characters,” her indigent
niece and companion, a fellow who
vainly seeks the niece’s hand, and a
murderer, young, handsome, and para-
noid. He ingratiates himself with the old
lady, seeking her money, and eventually
murders her. The niece falls in love with
him shortly after. It is a play laden with
unsubtle dramatic ironies like “Oh r
you’ll be the death of me, Dan,” and
on the level of a simple thriller the
suspense is quite well done.
In fact, the whole play is well done.
Herbert Davies’ direction is polished,
intelligent, and tightly organised. The
stage is well furnished in sombre
Edwardian furniture, carrying with it
messages of English drawing-room doom
as the lights mute at evening, the
shadows crowd in, and an owl hoots.
I thought Mr. Davies missed a point in
dressing his cast in angular, heavy-
shouldered ’forties fashions. In the
’sixties they do tend to add a certain
touch of menace, but nowhere near
what would have been given if costum-
ing from the mid-’thirties had been used
—tubular, sinuous, early Charles Addams.


Our Communicating column
has been held over this week.
Still, visually and in performance, the
play works well.
Rita Street’s Mrs. Bramson is admir-
ably played. She is a sharp, self-
centred, vindictive woman, and Miss
Street adds a further dimension by
giving her a fairly crude suburban Eng-
lish accent. Fussing and awkward in her
wheelchair, demanding, assertive, and
deceitful, the character is excellently
conceived and cleverly played. Rob
Antill’s Dan, the murderer, is convinc-
ing but uneven, being played too often
and too long at the one high
monotonous pitch. There are other ways
to express insanity. Lola Blachowicz’s
maid and Bridget Phillips’ cook are
rightly amusing, yet nicely understated.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
HOW NOT TO DO IT
The Tiger Makes Out. Director, Arthur
Hiller.
NOW THAT most hit plays, as well
as the classic dramas, seem to reach
the screen, the question keeps asking
itself: what’s the best way to film a stage
play? It’s no use simply setting up
cameras in the wings and the third row
centre of the stalls and photographing a
theatrical performance; the result is
creaky and stagy in the worst sense.
This was the chief fault with Olivier’s
“Othello,” in which the camera re-
moved the immediacy of the live drama
while adding nothing of its own.
On the other hand, a director can
be so determined to have a cinematic
approach that the play itself gets lost,
as with Zefferelli’s “Taming Of The
Shrew,” or Lester’s “The Knack.” It
Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson study
French in "The Tiger Makes Out”
seems to me that if a director is given
a well-constructed play with good dia-
logue and strong characterisation, the
best thing is not to mess it about too
much transfer it to the screen so that
the flavor remains intact, with only the
basic differences in technique required
by the different media. This seems to
have worked very well with “Virginia
Woolf,” “A Streetcar Named Desire,”
“Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” and
the recent, delightful “The Odd
Couple.”
“The Tiger Makes Out” is a sad
example of how not to film a play.
Originally half a double playbill, “The
Tiger,” as it was called, was a deftly
constructed, funny, and touching play
about a lonely bachelor who, frustrated
in his longing for affection, conversa-
tion, and education, decides to assert
himself by kidnapping a woman. After
her initial alarm, the woman is sympa-
thetic and attracted: she, too, is bored
by a dull, suburban married life. The
play ends with their happily arranging
to meet once a week to make love and
study French together.
Well, since Murray Schisgal adapted
his own play for the screen, he can’t
blame anyone but himself for overload-
ing this sound and simple idea with
irrelevancies until it sinks under the
strain. Long sequences show us the
tensions building up' in the Tiger,
equally long ones facetiously describe
the housewife’s suburban background;
what seem like hundreds of extraneous
characters are introduced, each one
kinkier than the last. The whole thing
finally becomes a mere series of slap-
stick gags, and, admittedly, some of
them are funny; but they don’t add up
to a play or a movie.
Arthur Hiller’s hysterical, original-at-
all-costs direction compounds the
offence. And the really infuriating thing
is that the performances are unexcep-
tionable, especially those by Eli Wallach
and Anne Jackson, who played the roles
in the original Broadway production.
These two mysteriously manage to give
both humor and humanity to the main
characters, even in the midst of this
chaos, and they are particularly
impressive in a central sequence when
the original play makes a short, nervous
appearance before scuttling for cover
again.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
MAJESTIC AMMUNITION
THE GULF between a great performer
and a good performer becomes increas-
ingly difficult to account for these days.
Most young musicians of talent are sub-
jected to training which ensures a tech-
nique capable of handling anything in
the repertoire, although this is prob-
ably more true of pianists than of those
who take up the more unpredictable
instruments. Their intellectual develop-
ment is fostered, they commit no
stylistic crimes, they feel passionately
about their work, but they are mole-
hills compared with a mountain like
Arrau.
Beethoven’s “Emperor Concerto,”
with Ferdinand Leitner and the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, at the Town
Hall, was a copybook illustration of
the void which separates talent from
genius. Admittedly, Claudio Arrau has
both these qualities in full measure, but
the result was more than authoritative,
for it had majesty and a perceptive
vitality which is denied all but a hand-
ful of players in our time. Arrau’s
ability to see a whole movement in one
piece is remarkable; there is never
aesthetic hiatus no matter how episodic
the music may be; everything flows
logically and inevitably, the storms and
calms being but part of the conceptual
sweep of the work.
While demonstrably not the greatest
of Beethoven’s piano concertos, the
“Emperor” is the best-loved, probably
because of its tag-name, which would
have annoyed the composer mightily,
for he was not at all keen on monarchs.
Familiarity has possibly lulled listeners
and performers into a false sense of
security over this work, but it is full
of traps for the unwary, which in this
performance were negotiated superbly
by all concerned. The main trap of
course is the opening of the last move-
ment, where one can go on for years
without being too sure of the rhythm
of the first phrase; but with Arrau
there was no doubt, and the orchestra’s-
answer was equally cogent.
Throughout the performance there-
was wonderful ammunition for those
who claim that there is such a. thing as
qualitative touch in piano-playing;
otherwise how could Mr. Arrau make
the instrument sound better than most
other pianists, particularly in the
serene calm and tenderness of the slow
movement.
The vitality in the orchestra’s play-
ing in the “Emperor” was presaged by
the first half of the concert, where the
Symphony in Three Movements by
Stravinsky and the Symphony No. 104
of Haydn got fresh and accurate per-
formances. Oddly enough, it was this
very freshness which removed some of
the opulence in the Stravinsky. This
work is a comparative oasis in the
cerebral and/or brutal aspects of much
of Stravinsky’s absolute music, and the
warm, romantic element lacked bloom
despite some sensitive contributions
from the orchestral soloists. Again the
well-nigh faultless playing in the
Haydn failed to convince one that the
No. 104 is among the world’s great
symphonies, which indeed it is.
Although the Olympian opening was
most impressive, the performance on
the whole had a chamber quality, which
was inclined to constrict this most
spacious of Haydn symphonies.
Pavel Guerdjikov’s recital at the
Sydney Town Hall was in place of the
second concert he was obliged to cancel
through indisposition. As a recitalist,.
Mr. Guerdjikov labors under two major
handicaps at his present state of de-
velopment; he is unable to create any
real tone in languages outside his own
or allied tongues and his platform
manner is irritatingly arch at times.
Donald Hollier’s accompaniments,
while admirably balanced to the audi-
ence in close proximity to the platform,

back of the hall, and this was hardly
Mr. Hollier’s fault.
Most successful were the Moussorg-
sky, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Bartok
songs, in which the singer displayed very
real musicality. The concert ended
with some Benjamin Britten settings of
British folksongs. I have never been
able to understand why Britten ever
allowed some of these settings to be
published. This sort of thing can be
great fun tossed off at a party; colliding
canons are always good for a laugh,
but to perpetuate them is presumptuous.
ART/ELWYN LYNN
VERY MIXED FEELINGS
Thirty-fourth Venice Biennale. Venice,
Italy.
THIS BIENNALE is generally felt to
be the end of those national displays
that began in 1895, and in which Aus-
tralia has participated three times. This
year there are 33 countries and the
largest number was 36 in 1958 and
1964. Whether Australia should par-
ticipate is now arguable, but the cogent
arguments for participation seem un-
known in Canberra, where every two
years the Art Advisory Board, whose
members are not expert in the con-
temporary field, have not been noted
for persuading the Government to
supply funds for participation. The
situation right now is a buck-passer’s
paradisal dream, as no one knows who is
responsible with three art bureaucracies
now in Canberra.
In Italy, anger was aroused because
the organisers decided to limit the
number of Italian participants and give
the space to a laudable notion: inter-
national tendencies, 1950-1965, but un-
fortunately the choices, especially in
the cases of Hofmann and Tapies, are
poor and, without a Pollock, the situ-
ation is absurd. This piccolo attempt to
do what Kassel’s Documenta does so
brilliantly only highlighted what
students felt to be fumbling with the
real issues of art. The great public
exhibitions in Italy and the galleries
are under statutory control (Novelli,
who withdrew from the Biennale, re-
minded Italians, under whose regime
most of the statutes were passed, by
writing on his covered painting
“Biennale fascista”) and organisers
seem as remote from actuality as our
Art Advisory Board; artists had be-
sieged the Milan Triennale, 40 Italian
painters had condemned the “wantonly
personal” hanging of Rome’s new
gallery, and Venice’s Accademia students
had denounced the sheer com-
mercialism of the Biennale and in par-
ticular Professor Gian Alberto
Dell’Acqua’s simplistic introduction to
the catalogue. (Professor Dell’Acqua
has just been to the Victorian Culture
Centre’s jamboree and maybe he gave
someone some experienced advice
about Australia’s participation in the
Biennale.)
Demonstrations led to withdrawals,
the postponement of prize awards, and
a charge by police in St. Mark’s
Square; it all seems to have aroused
little interest in the Biennale itself, for
while the summer streets swarm with
crowds in summer international styles,
more international than the sculpture
and painting, the Biennale is as quiet
as a graveyard, some of the headstone
sculpture from Greece, Italy, and
Switzerland only adding to the calm.
What was all the fuss about? As at
Kassel there was local national annoy-
ance about exclusion, but what seems
to have occurred is what is occurring
in Australia: the old avant-garde has
becorrfe an establishment with close
associations (rather natural, of course)
with the commercial world; the new
avant-garde, which is concerned with
experiment, is excluded or its role re-
duced to one of mere desperate gim-
mickry. (In Australia, on the day The
Field opened in the National Art Gallery
of Victoria, it was denounced by the
old avant-garde, a dealer, Rudy Komon,
an established and well-commissioned
sculptor, Redpath, and an established
OBE, Len French, who is also a mem-
ber of the new Commonwealth National
Gallery Council. It’s an old and dull
story; when the revolution is over, its
heroes only want to display their
medals and an occasional scar when
the young show too much ingratitude.)
There are other establishments and
anti-revolutionary revolutionaries like
the Russians, whose pavilion (most
countries have their own pavilions)
houses some paintings glorifying suffer-
ing for the revolution, some children’s
book illustrations, and some paintings
on orbital flights. These are science-
fiction illustrations strictly for the older
children and in contrast to the real
progress in the Rumanian, Yugoslavian,
and Czechoslovakian exhibits. A sign
of what might happen now to Czecho-
slovakian freedom in painting is indi-
cated in the Polish pavilion; four years
ago Polish painting was the sign that all
was not dead behind the Iron Curtain,
but it is now academic modern, and
lifeless.
It is, however, apparently the
Western world’s commercialism that
worries the protesters rather than Iron
Curtain repressions, but the film festival,
which opened on August 25, caused no
riots because its organiser decided to
avoid the commercial, national film
groups (16 boycotted him) and go for
art that was not a commodity, and
Marcuse-minded students relaxed.
As far as art goes it seems that what
is wanted is experiment and quality,
and it’s clear that what people want is
evidence not of movements and influ-
ences but of quality and the questing
mind. Consequently, it is in the experi-
mental, not in the penniless heirs of
Pop Art but in kinetics, that attract, but
even these kineticists, like Schoeffer,
have been around since 1955 and the
greatest of all, Pol Bury, is badly
represented. Quality, positive, unadul-
terated and swinging, came with the
sculpture of Phillip King and the
optical paintings by Bridget Riley, both
in the British Pavilion and both crisp
and buoyant and original. The Ameri-
cans decided to show their realists
Above, Russian Alexei Leonov’s “The
Black Sea” of 1966, contrasts with
“Flowering City” (1968), by Czech
Vladimir Preclik (left)
Porter, Diebenkorn, Dickinson, Baskin,
Cremean, and McGarrell, who are
simply absurdly weak in comparison
with our antipodeans: only Gallo’s
waxy sculptures, Red Grooms’ walk-in
papiermache City of Chicago, and
Nakian’s huge, clumsy, tortured sculp-
ture, the only really unsmooth objects
about, had any true force.
There was not enough that was mem-
orable: too much was superficial in
form and comment, but there are still
some remarkable men about like Piotr
Kowalski, who threads green fluorescent
tubes in black triangles, Pino Pascali,
who makes horrific tables, mattresses,
and carpets of steel wool, felt, and
combed wool. Too many are concerned
with mere design; too few have Riley’s
lively exuberance, Pascali’s oddity, or
real vision as in Delvaux’s retrospec-
tive of his nude somnambulists, who
seem to walk through a modern-art
world that is temporarily suspended,
directionless, and without will.

TWO UNLIKELY
TALES OF THE
VIETNAM WAR
By ROBERT O'NEILL
One Very Hot Day. David Halberstam.
Bodley Head. $3.60.
The Wine of God’s Anger. Kenneth
Cook. Cheshire-Lansdowne. $1.95.
BOTH BOOKS ARE novels about the
war in Vietnam the former
explicitly and the latter implicitly.
Kenneth Cook in writing a novel about
Australian soldiers is treading a path
which has been chosen by few with
any success save T. A. G. Hungerford
and Eric Lambert. Considering the
unusually large number of wars for
a country of its size that Australia has
participated in since Federation, this
paucity of literature indicates some
major problems in the novelist’s way
with regard to the military experience.
Some of the difficulties are no doubt
related to social attitudes toward wars
and soldiers, but possibly the major
difficulty in writing a war novel is
the nature of the Australian soldier
himself. Phlegmatic matesmanship
among members of an army which
is playing a minor role in a vast
alliance offers bleak prospects for
successful publication to both authors
and publishers. However, every now
and then over the past fifty years
some adventurous author has accepted
the challenge, and Kenneth Cook now
lays his response before us.
Authors of other nationalities are not
entirely free from similar problems,
but in general their task is easier and
in particular, when they are writing
about American soldiers, they have a
considerable advantage, because the
self-analysing, impulsive, approval-
seeking, recklessly brave GI is superb
subject material, perhaps second only
to the romantic, devout, honorable,
and energetic German who cannot
bring himself to defy Hitler. Thus, in
comparing these two books, Halber-
stam’s natural advantages over Cook
ought to be borne in mind.
Apart from the Vietnamese setting,
the two stories have two main points
of similarity. First, they are both con-
structed around military operations
which seem pointless in terms of
military effect. Australians and Ameri-
cans blunder, with a predictability
which is apparent in the opening
chapters, into disasters which result in
Viet Cong victories. Since each book
concentrates on the individuals who
are experiencing these ordeals rather
than on the situation as a whole, this
tactical bias may seem defensible. How-
ever, each author is also ridiculing
American and Australian involvement
in Vietnam and it is a little disappoint-
ing that neither has felt sufficiently
confident to use a scenario which is
not peopled by fools. Second, both
writers consistently refer to the enemy
as “the Communists” a loaded term
with connotations so inappropriate that
it is hardly, if ever, used forward of
JUSPAO briefings in Saigon.
However, the differences between
these two books are much more striking
and revealing than the similarities.
Halberstam keeps to a very tight plot,
which describes in 216 pages the events
of a single “very hot day,” making use
of several copious flashbacks to describe
his characters more fully and to show
what they get up to in their off-duty
hours. Cook’s story is much more com-
plicated and ambitious. It is told
through the hero a deeply religious
Catholic who has “volunteered” to
save the world from Communism. Apart
from Cook’s use of the concept of the
volunteer in a 1914-18 sense, he has
fabricated a hero type which has no
parallel in reality, and thus many of
Cook... fanciful combat situations
the problems encountered by this hero
are unreal. The narrative spans the
many months between the hero’s resolve
to volunteer and his final desertion from
the unit with which he is fighting. It is
an elaborate and carefully thought-out
attempt to make the life of an Austra-
lian private in Vietnam suitably dram-
atic to sustain a reader’s interest for
155 pages. Unfortunately, in this pro-
cess Cook sacrifices so much plausibility
to sensation that he charges his wind-
mill with a somewhat blunted lance.
. Halberstam’s characters are real
enough, although he perhaps flatters
the American Army posting system in
allowing it to be so successful in dump-
ing all its dead wood into the one small
heap in the Mekong Delta. Usually the
homogeneity of such an outpost of no-
hopers is shattered by the admixture of
one person of average ability. However,
he makes up for this American de-
ficiency in quality by including some
abnormally bright Vietnamese soldiers,
who manage to make their “advisers”
look rather foolish on occasions. The
main character, Captain Beaupre, is an
aging veteran of World War II and
Korea, suddenly transferred from the
pasture of an ROTC program at an
American college to re-enact a role he
had played briefly in Korea as an in-
filtrator behind enemy lines, and is con-
cerned simply with serving out the re-
maining two years of his 20-year hitch.
His life in America has resulted in bore-
dom and failure, and so the discom-
forts of Vietnam are borne with an ease
which a successful man w r ould not en-
joy. His fellow officers are caricatures
of naivety, thuggery, and cynicism, re-
spectively. However, the descriptions of
their environment are rendered with
such faithfulness and detail that many
of the problems facing allied advisers
in Vietnam are illustrated skilfully. .
By sharp contrast with Halberstam’s
technical mastery of the Vietnamese
countryside and of how operations are
conducted, Cook’s treatment of com-
bat situations is fanciful. Sergeant
Brown, 10 feet away from the hero, is
obliterated by a mortar bomb, while the
hero is unscathed. Australians charge
about the jungle while trapped by a
larger Viet Cong force without suffer-
ing • the total casualties which such
moves warrant. Direction of three
platoons in a battle by some sort of
higher headquarters appears to be
entirely absent. The whole of the hero’s
narration of various battles and actions
takes place without evincing the
slightest feeling of humanity toward his
fellows, .yet finding sufficient wit in
the midst of danger to make little
satirical analyses of the nature of war,
of the Army, of mankind, or of himself,
such as: “I could hear somebody crying,
sobbing like a maniac. Then I realised
it was me, so I stopped. Or tried to,”
and “In a way I wish I could dislike
Lieutenant Roberts, because he finally
killed Karl. But he didn’t. Karl killed
himself. Lieutenant Roberts was faced
with the problem of a soldier refusing
to advance in the middle of a battle.
Shooting soldiers who take an inde-
pendent line like that is a recognised
and honorable action by good officers.”
Cook reaches a very fitting climax
when Lieutenant Roberts is castrated
by an explosion which leaves him other-
wise unscathed, despite blowing off the
most protected parts of his anatomy.
The final page contains such philosophy
as: “What are women to me when
Lieutenant Roberts’ balls can lie on a
plateau surrounded by burned-out
jungle? . . . What do I understand
about anything? It’s all a broad and
bloody farce, but I wish I wasn’t the
only one in the group who came out so
unlovable. I wish my bullet had missed
Santi.
“I want to go to confession. I
want to kneel in a confessional full of
guilt and misery and say, ‘Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned. I went to war
to save the world from Communism.’

theme of Vietnam which is slowly
breaking over us.
THE YOUNG AVIATORS
By NANCY KEESING
Early Birds. H. C. Miller. Rigby. $3.50.
NOWADAYS NO ONE doubts that
man, if he avoids achieving his own
destruction, can and will achieve any-
thing. We ask “Who?” and “When?”
rather than “Can?” or “How possible?”
It is this, rather than blaseness, which
makes it so difficult to recall even
one’s own enthusiasms to try (as I
recently did for my ten-year-old son)
to re-create the excitement of a little
girl and her parents peering through
the sky over Darling Point for a glimpse
of Amy Johnson’s epic plane. To
remember the envy we felt for a
schoolfellow who had actually been for
a joyride “Did he loop the loop?”
-- or the bliss, at five years old, of
being lifted into the cockpit of P. G.
Taylor’s plane at Pittwater and being
allowed to jiggle the joystick “How
kind of him, but quite mad ... if
you’d broken something!”
Horrie Miller, whom I once had the
privilege of meeting, is a man whose
love affair with flight spans nearly all
its history, who can recreate the pris-
tine excitement, and who writes as he
speaks, in a straightforward, spare, in-
formative style which I find the more
enthralling for having to think behind
Mr. Miller’s modest understatements:
“To eliminate stops when flying from
Brisbane to Sydney (in an Avro, 1924)
we carried petrol cans and a patent
pourer in the back cockpit so we could
refuel in mid-air. I held speed down to
a minimum as Beckman . . . balanced
on the sides of the cockpit, performed
this delicate operation. It called for a
steady hand and a good head, as he
could easily have been caught by the
wind and thrown overboard.”
Miller was born in 1893 at Creswick,
in Victoria, son of a “tall, quiet, uncom-
municative Scot.” His mother died
when he was six months old and when
he was ten his father, hopeful of making
a fortune as accountant at the Western
Australian goldfields, left the boy with
a dairyfarming family in Gippsland.
Young Miller made his “escape as soon
as possible”; the episode marked the
end of his formal schooling. After a
disastrous period as a baker’s cart off-
sider, he found work with an early
private-hire-car service; then in an
engineering factory, where about 1908
he became enthralled by the exploits
of pioneer aviators and began making
model aircraft as a hobby. This was a
“way-out game” at the time, and to
avoid larrikin jeers he flew his models
at night along Alma Rd., St. Kilda. One
night Maurice Shmith, of Tarrant
Motors, driving, along in his Model T
Ford, nearly collided with a 'model.
Shmith was impressed with the aircraft
and its maker and gave the lad a £5-a-
week job at his factory.
Here Miller met the “three Harrys
Hawker, Busteed, and Kauper all
destined to make names for themselves
in aviation.” The youths, all “mad keen
devotees of the new age of motor
power,” became friends together with
Bob Cousins. The Harrys left for Eng-
land in 1911, where, not easih first,
they found work in the young aviation
industry. Busteed and Hawker (the
latter destined for the greatest fame, as
designer, pilot, and innovator, of them
all) found work at Sopwith’s factory.
Miller and Cousins, younger than their
friends, scraped and saved to follow
Miller as a hire-car driver. In 1913
they sailed for England.
T. O. M. Sopwith, a pioneer aviator
who made his first money from stunts,
exhibitions, and prizes, took Miller and
Cousins on in his factory 6 a.m.
start, finish often at 10 p.m., a total of
two hours’ meal breaks in the day and
4d an hour wages! Miller’s only dis-
appointment was that he seemed as
far as ever from learning to fly.
The hero of the day was Harry
Hawker, breaker of records, winner of
prizes, designer of genius. This book is
dedicated to him. It was Hawker who
(with Miller as anxious mechanic on
the ground) deliberately put a plane
into a spin and then proved his theory
that to push the stick forward, not
back, was the answer to what had
hitherto been the worst and most fatal
hazard of early flight.
Soon after World War I broke out,
Miller, hoping to join the first contin-
gent of the newly formed Australian
Flying Corps, booked his passage home.
He missed the first contingent, and
while waiting to join up spent weeks
of devoted borrowing, scrounging, and
effort in building, with Bob Cousins, a
beautiful little plane of his own design.
He had not yet flown solo, and was
called up soon after the plane was com-
pleted: “It has always been one of the
regrets of my life that I was forced
to part with my smart little aircraft
before doing justice to her powers of
flight.”
Miller returned to Australia after the
war, and from this time on “Early
Birds” is a fascinating account of the
beginnings of commercial aviation in
Australia, which, partly for geographi-
cal reasons, partly because of the imagi-
nation of its early aviators, was a world
leader in air transport. Miller’s account
stops at the mid- 19305. By then his own
firm (Macßobertson Miller) and that
of his friend Sir Hudson Fysh (Qantas)
and others were firmly established; their
subsequent history is not that of the
“really ‘early birds.’ ”
Readers live with Miller, Rees, and
others through the picaresque years of
“joyrides, advertising, and charter trips
. . . aerial photography, and medical
flights, with or without doctor and
often to places where aircraft had never
landed before.” The pilots landed where
it pleased them, or where necessity
dictated. They tied their planes to
fences or trees overnight; repaired the
damage caused by willy-willys, curious
goats and cattle, human vandals; raced
each other for well-earned prizes and
better-earned heroes’ welcomes and
loved their planes, or sometimes hated
them, in an almost personal way.
It would be silly to say “we shall not
see their like again” of Hawker, Wiggles-
worth, “Puck” Grosvenor, Darcy Rees,
or Miller himself. But we shan’t see
their like again in quite this way, or
perhaps on or immediately above this
planet. Therefore we are fortunate to
enter their lives through the memory of
so unassuming, reliable, and enthusiastic
a chronicler, who, throughout his life,
has viewed all creation with interest,
cannot imagine boredom, and says:
“Looking back over the history of
aviation I often think how many failures
man might have spared himself by pay-
ing more attention to the basic principles
of nature . . . the dragonfly . . . the
hawk moth,” and who credits no genius
of past or present civilisations with “the-
simple plan-form of the swept-wing
without any unnecessary complication
... It was the Australian Aboriginal . . .
Place a jet engine in the centre of a
boomerang and you have a modern
swept-wing fighter.”

WHAT A LAUGH! What a leg-pull!
But the three-dollar-and-ninety-cent
question is whose laugh and whose leg?
Mary McCarthy must be in on the joke:
she contributes an earnest-sounding,
tongue-in-cheek blurb about female ids
and super-egos. So, no doubt, are the
highly respected publishers with their
“quotes” of jet-propelled Candides,
20th-century comic masterpieces, and
super-cool McLuhan Age heroines, while
carefully avoiding mentioning the
source of these astonishing tributes. But
the joker-in chief is certainly the
Italian-born authoress herself, the
decorative Gaia Servadio with the Mona
Lisa smile, now the wife of the English
art historian William Mostyn-Owen. It
really makes a reviewer’s day to imagine
all three waiting around with suitably
straight faces totting up the number of
learned critics who fall Ern Malley-wise
into the trap of taking this extra-
ordinary piece of Pop or Commercial
Art work seriously.
Meanwhile, back home in London,
the book has apparently been launched
to the fanfares of a nationwide pub-
licity campaign in dailies, glossies, and
TV. All it seems to need now is for
some “Mother of Five” to write out-
raged letters to “The Times” on the
question of possible obscenity and the

Love is not a dirty word.
An eminent psychiatrist has said married men need
more “warm love”. And with a timely and provo-
cative article entitled “What Every Husband
Needs” this is explained in the September issue of
Reader’s Digest. The many facets of love and
sex are discussed intimately.
Outstanding articles of integrity on controversial
topics such as marital relations and other vital
matters, have made Digest what it is today the
second biggest magazine in readership by women,
over 1.4 million readers.* What’s more, Digest
women readers are in homes of higher income, do
more entertaining, and have more money to spend
than the women readers of any other magazine.
Shop around and compare. You’ll find that Digest
female readership is climbing at a much higher
rate than the others. If you’re selling to women,
talk to a Digest man soon.
If you want your sales to grow, doesn’t it make
sense to use the growing advertising medium?

harmful effects on her schoolgirl
daughter, who, unlike Melinda, had not
previously thought of raping her father
at the age of 13, of marrying a homo-
sexual, or of seducing the Prime
Minister. The writing is shocking!
The dust jacket alone is enough to
rivet disbelieving eye-swivelling atten-
tion. It is divided with superb impar-
tiality between half an I’m-backing-
Britain Union Jack and that piece of
Victorian cheesecake undressed in gauzy
orange veils known as “Flaming June,”
reproduced by courtesy of the Ponce
Art Museum, Puerto Rico. The novel
is dedicated to Pucci, and was written
in Italian, but there is no mention of
any publication in Italy.
Melinda Publishing is a young and,
of course, beautiful woman with only a
single thought Melinda. Unhampered
by any inhibition, she devotes her life
to humoring her slightest whim, the
more outrageous the better. Only a
computer could keep count of the legal
husbands she goes through in the course
of the story, and the number of casuals
she jumps in and out of bed with,
heterosexual, homosexual (both male
and female), and all the various shades
in between. In her spare time she
becomes a Master Spy (or should it
be Mistress?), is elected to Parliament,
poisons her current brother-in-law to
become a Duchess, serves time as a
Pussygirl in the Sexyboys’ Club,, and
kills off three of her fellow Pussies, is
created a Baroness, becomes partner in
a sperm clinic in Tangier (Nobel Prize
winners being much in demand), and
co-plans the Great Train Robbery,
mothers numerous unidentifiable chil-
dren, whom she never seems to see
again.
As undercover agent she makes
James Bond look like a good amateur
and his witty counterfeit Boysie Oakes
a mere beginner. As bedtime gymnast
she outruns all her rivals. But there is
nothing quite as boring as unvarnished
sex once the novelty wears off, as the
Danes recently discovered pornog-
raphy died a natural death after
Denmark wisely abolished all publica-
tion obscenity laws. With “Melinda,”
inevitably, after the first laugh comes
the yawn. A little sparkle might have
helped things along. But the style is
deliberately unemotional.
The heroine remains a bit of a card-
board figure. She does; or things are
done to her. But Melinda never “is.”
One does not succeed in discovering
why men rush her, and women, too.
The famous last words that fall from
her ruby lips—unquotable, of course—
come from Melinda in her role of solo
astronaut in unplanned orbit around
the earth in a jammed moon-rocket.
While the food and oxygen slowly peter
out, the mourning globe’s TV screens
show beautiful, slightly premature obitu-
aries. For this nice touch of poetic
justice one may wish “Melinda” bon
voyage. Every author, at some time,
dreams of writing a best-seller just for
the hell of it. Gaia Servadio might have
hit the jackpot.

CHARITY BEGINS AT
HOME-PREFERABLY
SOMEONE ELSE'S
THROUGHOUT the length and
breadth of Australia, on almost any day
of the week, you can attend charity
luncheons at most of the large hostel-
eries and in the homes of many of our
leading citizens (or even those aspiring
to such eminence sooner rather than
later).
I would bet “London to a brick,” as
Ken Howard would say, that you are
going to be confronted (never mind
how much you paid for your ticket)
with a piece of cold chicken and salad,
or equally cold roast chicken with
chilly potatoes and peas.
Second favorite will be chicken and
mushrooms in a nice wine brew and
a sludge, usually pale grey, interspersed
(if you are lucky) with peas, but in no
way resembling, even remotely, the
rice it claims to be.
Any restaurant proud of its reputa-
tion (and realising the value of enter-
taining in one fell swoop so many
potential big spenders) would surely be
willing, you’d think, to stage such
functions at something near cost price,
and thus give value for money. At
least half of those present would return
on another occasion if the food was
good; so what, if just this once, they
don’t make a huge profit?
But, unfortunately, that type of res-
taurant is rare. Everybody wants his
pound of flesh even from charity.
So usually lunches of this nature, to
make the most profit, are given in
someone’s house. For a committee, in-
experienced in assessing and pricing a
menu for large numbers of guests,
chicken seems easiest; a certain-sized
chook will feed a given number of
people, and one can charge so much
and still make a profit of so much.
Large numbers of chickens can also be
easily cooked in an average kitchen
without a semi-professional set-up.
Nevertheless, if you happen to sit on
such a committee (or are just plain
bored with roast chicken or sludge),
then the time has come to dig in your
toes and demand some reforms. Most
of us women would admit, I suspect,
that once over thirty our lunch usually
consists of a bowl of soup in winter, a
sandwich with leftovers of last night’s
dinner in summer, or an apple and
cheese if we’re really dieting unless
one is going out somewhere.
Even then, no one really wants a
huge meal, because, as we all know, it
is going to add inches to the waistline.
Of primary importance, then, is
the concept that, whatever we are
going to have, it should be small,
attractive to the eye, tantalising on the
palate, and easy on the waistline. Rice
cooked in huge quantities is always a
mistake. To be at its best it should
be light and fluffy, each kernel separate
from the others and, let’s face it,
it is hell to get out of the water at just
the right moment and keep warm
while being served without gluing up
into glumps.
It can be made into a jolly good
salad, however. The secret is to remove
it from the boiling water after exactly
12 minutes; rinse it under running hot
water, drain it, and then spread it on
trays to dry off completely. While still
warm, add sufficient french dressing
(four parts oil to one part vinegar) to
coat all the kernels when thoroughly
mixed. (This type of rice must be
slightly undercooked.)
Add finely chopped spring onions, a
little crushed garlic, crisp little cubes
of red and green capsicum for color,
chopped capers and gherkins for zest
and piquancy, sliced green and black
olives for interest but, whatever you
do, add a lot, not meagre amounts
flecked here and there through the
rice. Served with a variety of cold
meats and an interesting tossed salad
or two, this can be the basis of a good
cold luncheon. When preparing meats
for such a buffet it is well to remember
that most meat is best when cooked
rare even more essential when it is
to be served cold.
Lamb, for example, is nearly always
overcooked. Strange when one con-
siders that slightly pink lamb remains
juicy and tasty instead of stringy, as
when cooked to a dull grey color.
The Turks stuff lamb with a mix-
ture of cooked rice, cooked chestnuts,
currants, pistachio nuts, all seasoned
with salt, pepper, and cinnamon.
The Greeks add pounded garlic and
the juice of a lemon halfway through
the cooking period, which gives a
miraculous lift to the meat.
The Italians sprinkle their lamb with
rosemary, which gives a totally different
flavor.
All of these are good for hot or
cold meats. Only the English (and thus
many Australians) serve their lamb
with mint sauce or, worse yet, mint
jelly. Neither, in my opinion, does any-
thing for the lamb in question.
Roast veal can be stuffed with a
cup of fresh breadcrumbs, seasoned
with finely chopped parsley, herbs, and
chopped, soaked prunes. When sliced
cold it not only looks attractive but
makes the meat go farther. Roast beef
should be coated with a little french
mustard, liberally sprinkled with freshly
ground black pepper, and cooked to a
point where it is still bright pink on
the inside. Served cold in slices with
horseradish it is scrumptious.
Cold ham is interesting when baked
(once the skin has been removed) with
an unusual basting. Personally, I am a
little bored with pineapple and cloves
and prefer a jar of blackcurrant jam
liberally spread over the scored ham,
with a dusting of cinnamon and a full-
flavored bottle of red for basting in a
medium-hot oven. Even better cold.

Racist fanatic
or innocent citizen?
How was James Earl Ray able to elude the FBI
for so long? Was the suspected murderer of Dr.
Martin Luther King part of an extremist political
plot? Or was he simply an impulse killer with a
mind twisted by racial bigotry? “The Greatest
Manhunt in the History of Crime”, in the Sep-
tember issue of Reader’s Digest, vividly tells of
Ray’s pursuit and capture.
Such real-life drama is typical of Digest articles
and makes the plastic heroes of popular fiction
pale by comparison. Because this kind of reporting
captures the urgency of historic events, Digest is
the number one magazine in readership by men—
over 1.6 million readers.* Digest reaches more men
with higher business positions, more expensive cars
and who do more entertaining than the male read-
ers of any other magazine. Shop around and com-
pare. You’ll find that Digest male readership is
climbing at a much higher rate than the others. If
you’re selling to men, talk to a Digest man soon.
If you want your sales to grow, doesn’t it make
sense to use the growing advertising medium?

Vice-Chancellors' voices
On page 40 of the issue of the Bulletin

writes: “The Deputy Vice-Chancellor

tage, scored highest points with a piece
of academic bitchery, etc.” That state-
ment was made by Professor W. H. G.

Rural policies
In “More Handouts for Farmers”
(8., August 24) you speak of the in-
crease in Government subsidies to rural
industry, and state “clearly the rural
industries are being well looked after
in actual Budget handouts.” It would
be interesting to know how well you
think this Budget has looked after the
woolgrower.
Drought bonds will certainly be of
help to the arid-zone pastoralist, who
cannot diversify, or put the proceeds
of the good seasons into profitable im-
provements. The conditions imposed
by the Treasurer may well exclude
graziers in other circumstances from
the benefits of the scheme. It is ex-
tremely unlikely that they will be
available to farmers, though you
assume this in the article referred to.
It is unfortunate for the wool in-
dustry that their leaders speak with so
many voices. It is unrealistic for them
to ask, as some of them do, for a com-
plete reversal of the Government’s econ-
omic policy in order to ease the infla-
tionary pressures it creates.
It is not unrealistic, however, to ask
the Treasurer to use more imagination
in future in devising ways of relieving
the industry of some of its cost burden.
The special measures for which some
graziers are asking include grants to the
States which will reduce the burden
of such imposts. This may well be a
more imaginative approach to their
overall problems than to continue
thinking in terms of bigger subsidies.

No urban Ord
Peter Samuel, in “The high art of anti-
development” (8., June 29), is critical
of the N.S.W. Government for spending
money on the construction of the East-
ern Suburbs railway, which he classes
as an “urban Ord.” He states that “the
market for public transportation has
been weakening year by year, so great
is the attractiveness of individual trans-
portation provided by the motor-car.”
The private car, for all its conveni-
ence, is singularly inefficient as a means
of peak-hour transport in urban areas.
It has been conclusively proved in
America that it is impossible to provide
a road system of sufficient capacity to
allow free flow of private cars (each
carrying an average of 1.4 persons) in
peak hours. The demand rises faster
than the capacity.
A double-track electric railway can
carry as many people as a 20-lane
expressway, causes no parking problems
in the city area, and occupies far less
land (when underground, occupying no
surface land at all). Suburban railways
do not show a direct profit because
they are used to their full capacity for
approximately four hours out of 24.
However, they are indirectly profitable
because they provide the efficient trans-
port that is essential for the continued
well-being of the city. The Eastern
Suburbs railway is an essential exten-
sion to Sydney’s transport system, and
the State Government is to be con-
gratulated for going ahead with the
project.

Pharmaceutical benefits
I question your statement regarding
the extraordinarily excessive profits of
retail chemists in your references to the
Senate Select Committee (8., August
17). The Commonwealth is not
indifferent to retail chemists’ profits.
Each month the Department of Health
issues a list of price adjustments based
on changes in wholesale prices. Each
manufacturer is obliged to notify the
Government of any change in the cost
price of a benefit item under penalty
of delisting from the Benefits list, and
the retail price is then adjusted to show
a margin of 25 percent profit, to which
is then added, in most cases, a nominal
fee of 30 cents for the responsibility of
recording and dispensing the prescrip-
tion.
The drug companies have constantly
reduced the price of ethical products
available under the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme as research costs are
recouped. Only one month’s notification
of any price reduction is given, and it
would be impossible to conduct a
pharmacy while carrying only one
month’s stock, and as these reductions
could, in some cases, exceed the retail
profit margin the final retail price of
stocks held throughout this one-month
period may be less than the cost price.
As the Department of Health will not
make any allowance for any loss of this
nature, the pharmacist must bear the
loss. I would categorically state that the
pharmaceutical industry is unique in
the field of ethical price reductions, and
extraordinarily so when one realises that
nearly every other commodity has
shown a history of price rises.

Just the way it crouches low to the ground imparts the sensation of full flight! The new Dodge Phoenix
is a car with enormous power: under control but ready for release when you say so. Even the most
hardened sceptics are amazed by its agility and instant response. That’s easily understandable, too,
when you consider the size of the V 8 engines: a 318 cu. in. 230 b.h.p. or a 383 cu. in. 270b.h.p. But
power alone is not enough. The Dodge Phoenix is also the ultimate in luxury, softness and silence.
Words are a poor substitute for your own sense of touch and feel. And that’s reason enough to see
your nearby Chrysler Dodge Phoenix dealer. Soon!
