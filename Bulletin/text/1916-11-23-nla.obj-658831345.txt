An Anzac Bard
Until Gunner Westbrook enlisted lie had
never written a line of verse. He doesn’t write
very good verse, after all, and enlistment
hasn’t exactly improved his punctuation; but
it isn’t at all bad verse. Anzac and After
(Duckworth), with portrait, is real soldier’s
verse, direct and sincere, and informed with
an honest love for his home-land, Australia.
Many of these verses were written at Anzac.
And perhaps most charming of all his work
is “Lindenow,” unfortunately too long to
quote. But there are stanzas that are worth
while: —
When night is full of the red death’s scream-
ing,
Maddened by slaughter a fiend accurst,
His altar fires in the shell-burst’s gleaming,
Pwans of lust in the shrapnel-burst,
Above the roar and the smoke of battle -
I can see the Mitchell, and sweet and low
I can hear the call of the roaming cattle
In the homestead paddocks by Lindenow ....
See the smoke from the homestead lifting,
The blinking eyes of its lamps a-shine,
Hear the rune of the horse-bells drifting,
The low soft coll of the browsing kine. ...
If the clinging folds of the Ancient Reaper
Cover me close to the Earth’s warm
breast,
Then shall honor be my soul’s keeper,
Duty contented tvill bless my rest.
If freedom of flight to my soul be given,
I know of a surety I must go
To the nearest approach that I know to
Heaven,
Home, Australia, and Lindenow.
WHY?
Why did I go to the war? Dunno.
No doubt it was Destiny forced me to go,
I had dashed little knowledge of national
things
Pertaining to treaties and statutes and
kings;
A hazy idea that a 'ell of a scrap
Was twisting and changing the tints on the
map;
Grim tellings of slaughter and terrible
shame,
And capping them all teas Germany’s name;
Of fates worse than death for a mother and
maid,
Perhaps through it all I was somewhat
afraid
When remembering those ivho are dearer to
me
Than my life. And, yes, there may be
In the thoughts of their honor an impelling
\ spur,
To make things quite sure for my mother
and Her.
Berlinps ’twas some writer or speaker I’d
heard.
The blood of my ancestors wakened and
stirred,
And flung to my brain an appeal to my breed.
Maybe 1 followed some other chap's lead
Or was the natural love of a scrap
Some sort of dare-devil that wakes in a chap,
That challenges death for a jest or a taunt,
The sheer joy of living that nothing tvill
daunt.
I dunno, but I’ve fought, and I’ve been
through the mill.
What made me a soldier’s a mystery still;
But home’s not a home if it’s not worth a
fight —-
All things put together I know I’ve done
right.
Through danger and dark days and death I
am here,
I’m not learned or clever, but one thing is
clear,
I’ve a lot to be lost and dern little to gain,
But if things -were reversed Pd just do it
agdin;
For I know (for I’ve been) that war is just
hell.
Where death lurks with vermin and noise
and foul smell,
But, all things considered, I’d go out once
, more, ___
Though I'll never know rightly what takes me
to war.
From “Anzac and After,” by Gunner E.
Westbrook.
The Bosom of the Family
The war may be confidently trusted to
attend to the matters that Walter M.
Gallichan worries about, in The Great
Unmarried (Laurie, per Dymock’s Library).
He writes lengthily and ponderously upon
the question of celibacy and marriage; he
provides a heap of facts and deduces the
usual conclusions. “I contend that the way
of the man or woman, in all except the
privileged classes, who desires to love in
accordance with natural decree, and the
highest social morality, is rendered harder
and harder year by year. The discourage-
ment of licit sex-unions by economic, legis-
lative and ecclesiastic hindrances is one of
the flagrant sources of irregularity in sexual
life, etc.” Aud he pleads for the popularis-
ing of marriage. He finds no virtue in the
single man. “The celibate is a menace to
the common good. Living as he does, remote
from a great field of human experience,
emotion, joy, discipline aiul stress, he is not
efficiently equipped with the insight, know-
ledge ot Human nature and sympathy that
make good citizenship.” Gallichan points
out that our modern civilisation favors the
production of a neuter class of woman and
of man. “Men habitually employed in seden-
tary life tend to lose some of the masculine
secondary characters. Women who work
. . . .in the fields assume certain of the male
guises.” The reason is, of course, that no
woman is entirely feminine, and no man
wholly masculine. Hence, “The sturdy
woman blacksmith is physically a better
mail than the round-shouldered, weak-kneed,
anaemic clerk.... In the course of genera-
tions, environment may so influence the
whole organisation of women workers that
the female secondary traits may almost dis-
appear. .. .Typical celibate women, ap-
proaching the neuter order, are becoming
more common in the middle and better-edu-
cated classes. .. .A large number enter the
teaching profession.” The author sees in
this tendency a grave danger. The spinster
is not the person to educate the young; she
is responsible for “many of the false views
of life, the oblique and distorted conceptions
of love, arid the intellectual insincerities of
women. . . .It is questionable whether society
is wise in placing the voluntary perpetual
celibate woman in positions of authority and
responsibility, demanding a sympathetic
knowledge of human nature, its passions and
its foibles., . .Love, conjugality and mater-
nity, with their deep emotions, their felici-
ties, pains and disciplines, are beyond the
limited' boundary of tlieir experience,”
With regard to the perennial problem of
Flossie, the author makes the useful sugges-
tion that her job might be made undesirable
by the simple expedient of making marriage
more desirable and easy. Make marriage
popular and Flossie would become unpopu-
lar. “The practice of prostitution has very
rarely been even cheeked by repressive
measures, and there is no instance any-
where of its suppression by penal authority.
....If some of the activity applied to the
attempted suppression of sexual vice were
devoted to making the path of sexual virtue
less difficult, great triumphs for the moral-
ists would ensue.. ..Under our commercial
ideal of life, we actually make ‘vice’ lucra-
tive and attractive; while virtue is penalised
by sweating wages, a sordid struggle with
poverty, and unremitting, monotonous labor.
.. . .The annihilation of prostitution in-
volves the destruction of a number of firmly-
founded institutions, the shattering of the
present code of industrial ethics, the modi-
fication of marriage laws, an attack on
vested interests, a revolution in economic
conditions.”
Gallichan devotes a chapter to enumerate
the evil results of real celibacy, and the
mental, physical and moral advantages of
marital life. “It is estimated that by marry-
ing a man adds five years to his life, and a
woman four.” His conclusion is that “we
are a naturally monogamous people, but,
Giving to the numerous hindrances to wed-
lock, we are living in chaotic promiscuity.”
Discussing remedies, the author declares
against taxation of bachelors. “The best
way to diminish the number of bachelors is
to adapt marriage to the present needs of
the community by removing formidable hind-
rances to the altar.” His economic remedies
may be thus summarised: 1, raising wages
to a minimum standard for the support of
parents and a moderate family ; 2, provision
of cheap and sanitary houses; 3, encourage-
ment of rural life; 4, endowment of
daughters for marriage; 5, bonuses for large
families. Speaking in favor of cheap and
easy divorce, the author stresses the in-
structive fact that most divorced persons in
all countries marry again. “This shows
clearly the strength of the monogamic bias
in the Western nations; and it should serve
as a conclusive answer to those who affirm
that facility of divorce induces lax living.”
Freedom of divorce is not a factor of immo-
rality.
J*
The main conclusion is that we must
begin witli a new canonisation of
marriage. Artists, poets, preachers, poli-
ticians, writers, teachers and parents must
hold up the delights of conjugal love. We
must make the thing attractive. Evidently
the theatres must do their share. Most
plays, as most novels, contrast the pleasures
of an extra-conjugal passion with the tame-
ness of married life. Henceforth our novels
will show up the awful dullness of the
demimonde and the attractiveness of married
Babette, and our revues will disclose bored
husbands hastening homewards from the
cafe to the pleasures of domesticity. It
could be done, of course, but so far there
are no signs of this tremendous reform.
The charms of The Other Girl have been
sung long enough; poets and artists have
painted the beauty of her bosom: someone,
making his missus his muse, should write
an ode to that neglected bosom—the bosom
of the family.

priate: sold by the Red Cross Book Depot,

The only excuse for the publication of A
Commonplace Book, by J. T. Hackett (Has-
sell, Adelaide, 55.), is the statement that
the gross profits will go to the Repatriation
Fund. The collector offers this jumble of
quotations “as a commonplace book kept dur-
ing the important period in English litera-
ture from 1874 to 1889.” The haphazard
collection of passages that struck an indi-
vidual—this one admits that he has not neces-
sarily read' the works from which he put
down extracts—may have some value to that
individual, but precious little to the public.
As an indication of J. T. Hackett’s choice
of fragments, that widely-read author “Un-
known,” Avhose pen-name is often “Anon,” is
responsible for the most quotations; then
follow Browning, George Eliot, Emerson,
George MacDonald, Novalis and Swinburne,
IT. D. McLelland, Deputy-Chief Inspector
of Schools, N.S.W., has successfully done a
necessary thing. In The (Treat War, written
for young Australians (Govt. Printer, Syd-
ney), he has put, in a style that is as read-
able as his large print, the reasons for the
war and for our participation in it. He
briefly sketches the history of the Empire,
disregarding inessentials that would only con-
fuse the kid’s mind, and gives due apprecia-
tion to the part played by our Allies. He
concludes a xeadable essay with a selection
of poems of “liberty and life’s ideals,” into
which a few Australian poets are allowed to
intrude.

The Australian Manufacturer, a six-
penny weekly recently established (16 Bond-
street, Sydney), is admirably edited and pro-
duced. The articles, well illustrated, cover
apparently every aspect of manufacturing
both in Australia and overseas; but the
weekly is by no means a mere technical
journal. If ever this continent is going to
become a manufacturing country in earnest,
the stimulus and the tone of this journal
should appreciably contribute to that result.
A judicious selection of articles from other
scientific and technical journals give this
weekly the wide range of interest that it
cannoit yet acquire within the Common-
wealth.

way. The services of Queensland writers
have been very happily utilised in this all-

“Are we downhearted? No! Then why
Eire hell should you be!” That is the
deliberate moral of Trench Yarns, by
“Peter" (Cassell, Is.). “If you read be-
tween the lines you will realise that this
little book is intended to show how cheer-
ful the Army is under adverse circum-
stances. Why not cheer up, too? Don’t be
a pessimist; you know perfectly well, _in
your heart of hearts, that we are winning
this show hands down. Why not show it?”
“Peter" writes with the irresponsible cheer-
fulness of the British subaltern, and his
yarns are delightful. Though he says his
stories are founded on fact, he doesn’t vouch
for every incident. Of one neat yarn he
says. ‘‘You don’t believe this tale? No,
neither do I; but it amused me, so I put it
in, Sorry!’’ Hence we have our doubts
about the British airman who was forced
to descend in the German lines. The Bosches
strapped him tightly into the driving seat
and made him ascend, taking two Bosches
as observers, and fly along the British lines,
with the nose of a revolver gently insinu-
ated into the middle of the airman’s back.
He did as he was ordered, ascended high in
order to return to the Germans’ lines; and
then: “With that true resourcefulness that
has made Britain w r hat she is to-day, he
promptly looped the.loop, tipping out his
unfortunate foemen, who hit the dust with
some force from a height of 5000 feet. He
then returned to his own fireside, a man at
peace with all the world.” Also, this page
doubts whether, during a truce on Christmas
Day, a British officer, on the invitation of
a Bavarian officer, would accompany his
foe to the latter’s headquarters for a drink.
Still, the yarn is so delightful that probably
“Peter” couldn’t leave it out. And the
author, in one of his few serious moments,
describes a charge in the fewest words on
record: “A scramble out of the trench, a
deep, confident cheer, a slither across 50
yards of mud, a feeling like a red-hot needle
in the left arm, a jump into a yawning
ditch and if possible on to a terrified
Bosche, some heavy work with the bayonet,
a lot of mess, and the poor devils left are
shouting ‘lvaiuorad!’ and the trench is
ours.”

In response to several recent requests from
Australian playwrights with whom Aus-
tralian managers are either in negotiation for
their plays, or who hope to negotiate with
Australian managers for the production of
their plays, this page reprints (from R.P.
10/2/’l6» the gist of the contract between a
prominent London manager and the author
of Mrs. Pretty and the Premier, produced this
year in London. The untried Australian with
a play to sell to an Australian manager
usually does not know what he may ask for
his goods; and, while not insinuating that the
Australian manager does not, on the whole,
give the author a fair deal, this page thinks
that it is the Australian dramatist, and not
the more experienced Australian manager,
who needs assistance in his business negotia-
tions. The contract was, in essentials, this
The author. leases to the manager the sole right
of production in the Empire (except Canada) for
five years from date of first performance. The mana-
ger shall pay to the author £lOO in advance and on
account of royalties. The manager shall produce the
play before a certain date at a first-class theatre
and with a competent cast. Should he fail to do
so before that date he shall be allowed a further six
months in which to produce the play by a further
payment of £lOO in advance and on account of
royalties ; but should he fail to produce the play,
the manager forfeits the £2OO, and loses all his
rights in it.
The manager shall pay to the author royalties on
the gross receipts according to this scale: Up to
gross receipts of £BOO a week, 5 per cent.; on all
gross receipts in excess 6f £BOO up to £lOOO a
week, 7J per cent. ; on all gross receipts in excess of
£lOOO a week. 10 per cent.
The manager must announce the name of the
author as solo author on all programmes, posters,
etc.; he must furnish to the author’s agent proper
statements of gross weekly receipts; he shall have
the option for one month after first _ production to
purchase professional rights in the United States and
Canada by payment of £lOO in advance and on
account of royalties. The manager cannot assign the
agreement without the author’s consent. The author
retains all rights except those leased. He retains all
film rights (nowadays, a most important point) ;
but he has to prevent all amateur performances of
the play. The author undertakes that no film of the
play shall be released ’ during the five years’ 'lease.
Any offer the author gets for filming the play must ■
first be referred to the manager in order to allow
the manager and his company to play the leading
parts in the film.

Self-Loading Rifles
When you look over your sights and see an
animal like this silhouetted against the back-
ground, you like to feel certain that your
equipment is equal to the occasion. It is, if
you are armed with a Winchester Self-
Loader. Not only does this rifle shoot

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

MR. GEORGE GOODMAN.
The following testimony is from Mr.
George Goodman, better known as
“Goody” in the profession, and one of
the most widely and professionally
known of a band of brilliant theatrical
managers who form an artistic link
between the theatrical past and
present.
Mr. Goodman has been associated with
the present firm of J. C. Williamson,.
Ltd., for a long- number of years, ex-
tending back to its inception, when
as “Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove,” it occupied, as it does to-day,
the foremost position in the theatrical
world of Australia, and was respon-
sible for the finest imported produc-
tions of Grand Opera and Versatile
drama and comedy.
Mr. Goodman's experience with these
productions and association with the
many “stars” imported under the Wil-
liamson management, is proverbial,
and the following letter will be of
considerable interest to the many
members of the theatrical profession
throughout the Commonwealth, who.
physically exhausted by the exacting-
nature of their many r6les, will find
in the medicine Mr. Goodman advo-
cates a nerve rejuvenator and health
restorer of remarkable power and cer-
tainty. Mr. Goodman writes from his
Sydney residence thus: —
BEVERLY, BAYSWATER ROAD,
DARLTNGHURST, 20/9/'IG.
CLEMENTS TONIC Ltd.
I know the horrors of insomnia or lack of refreshing sleep as well as any
who have suffered acutely from it.
T have endured it often, combined with an irritable, excited and weakened
nerve condition that almost ruined my health. I am not wrong in stating that
this condition at times almost incapacitated me from my managerial duties.
Rut I experienced a pleasing and grateful change after taking the medicine
I w£ advised £ use-Clements Tonic. After taking it, that change may be
summarised thus:
1. Sweet, refreshing sleep EVERY NIGHT.
2. Real healthy appetite.
•> True eniovinent of life through being absolutely well, which 1
” attribute to no other source than this remarkable medicine to which
I testify.

have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by

heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in

tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke; therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect;; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizziness,
Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I have every
reason to believe were caused through the use of
tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are only re-
membered as a hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep
well, and feel fit to face the world again. It will give
me great pleasure to recommend your remedy to
others.”

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
OF all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and every movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Mourner.
War has the world’s wide canvas for its
screen;
With brushes wet with hues of lurid red
It adds abundant horrors to a scene,
Crowded with foul destruction, and the dead.
Keen life is quenched, and eager vigor slain;
Against that horror I would veil my sight,
But vainly might I hide me from the pain—
I heard a woman sobbing in the night!
There was no sound of soft, relieving rain
Within the storm that muttered through
those sobs;
But like a dry, harsh, blasting hurricane
That gives earth nothing, but its beauty
robs,
So seemed her passion, and the war’s vast
scene
Strangely eclipsed, seemed blotted from my
sight;
I only visioned, where its crowds had been,
A tearless woman, sobbing in the night!
The world in anguish mourns its manhood
slain;
And all the agonies that war has wrought
Deep to its heart have sent their stabs of
pain;
Joy falls to wreck and force o’ermasters
thought;
The large hopes die that nobly seemed to
rise,
While clouds of lust and murder hide the
light.
Always there stands before my heart and
eyes
A tearless woman sobbing in the night!

HAMER.
The Waterside.
The whirling, gritty, grating wheels are
biting on the rails ;
The wreckage loiters to and fro upon the
city tide;
And I must seek a place of wind, and gulls
and threshing sails
And all the magic that is spilled about the
Waterside.
The joggle of a rudder-post, a mast against
the sky,
The clatter of a busy winch, the creaking of
the crates,
The bustling little coaster-boat that roars
and welters by,
The banging of the fists of Trade upon the
harbor gates!
Strong voices round a teeming hatch, blithe
echoes from the shore;
The slow and stately swinging-in of many a
laden ship—
Kich vessels from the open ways the ocean
lifts to pour,
The wine that warms the city’s heart, upon
the city’s lip.
And I shall see the planing gulls and many a
nodding buoy,
And quivering flags and singing shrouds, the
blue sky breaking clear;
And all the salt within my blood will thrill
my heart with joy,
And I shall hear the fenders grunt and grunt
against the pier.
I cannot live the city life of laundered city
fools
Whose minds are straight and ordered as the
asphalt city ways;
Nor heed the petty maxims preached from
dizzy office stools—
The days are open to me, and I seek the
open days.
So shall I find the richer joys which gird the
Waterside,
For I’ve an ocean-going heart which leaps
beneath the rib ;
I go to where the world is clean and where
the sky is wide,
And leave to whiter hands than mine the
bondage of the nib.
MAORILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
Truth.
With laughing, crinkled mouth—not smooth
red lips
That treach’rous talk behind white finger-
tips—
An elfin sprite came in to sit by me.
Clear hazel eyes it had, green as the sea.
Wide eyes that smil’d the past—the yet to
be—
Where Knowledge blent with Patience, ten-
derly.
Truth, from their brink, with elfin voice and
smile,
Spoke now to me, who breathed a sigh the
while.
“Too many years,” it said, “have passed you
by,
Since in Life’s whirlpool came Illusion nigh
The vortex of Experience and you knew
How far to hold the fickle glamor true.”
I laughed—and woke. The grey cat at my
side
Blinked eyes of green, while on the pathway
wide
The gravel crunch’d beneath a quick-trod
boot.
I raised the powder puff... .Truth is Love’s
loot!
VICTORIA.

Good-night.
Gemming the velvet of the night,
A star sweeps singing o’er the sea;
The hushed earth trembles to its flight—
Good-night, good-night to you from me!

PERDRIAU TYRES are MADE 11ST AUSTRALIA to suit Australian
conditions, and because of the Pure Para Rubber and High-grade Cotton
Duck used in the manufacture, will yield immeasurably greater service than
any other tyre on the market.
The Rib feature is scientifically correct, and the three thick, heavy ribs of the
Perdriau Rubber Co. Ltd.,
Perdriau, which grip the road with an even tread, distribute the load evenly on the full
surface of the tyre, thus eliminating tread separation, fabric trouble and skidding.

thus beating the previous record by nearly two hours.
The distance is 3(io miles of rough and sandy roads.
The essential features required for work of this descrip-

powerful engine, correct gear ratio, and springing that
will absorb the maximum amount of road shock.

WHY NOT HAVE THE DEVIL, TAIL
AND ALL?
The Bulletin is hopefully waiting for the
dawn of a new day, when the politician will
discard his nonsense about civic patriotism,
and the promise of reform, and the vehement
advocacy of a fair deal. He might as well
make the great renunciation at once. To
the people these things have grown as stale
as the beer of yesteryear. They know and
the politician knows that the customary
talk about noble ambitions is mere hot air-
in nine cases out of ten, anyway. When
the blessed day arrives for all this preten-
tious humbug to be dropped, men will stand
up like honest, decent specimens of their
breed, and, extenuating nothing, explain
what they want to capture at the ballot-box.
Then the democracy will be able to make its
choice with the most ample guarantee that
the politician intends to pursue his way with
steadfast resolution to the bitter end, and
Party will begin to look respectable because
of its downright honesty. There will be no
flinging around of phrases—no banging the
loud drum of righteousness. The address
to the electors will be unchallengeable on the
score of candor, leaving not a single hole for
subsequent escape. It will not be delivered
in halls or the open air, but confided to the
press under conditions making errors in re-
porting impossible. And the electors will
then hear themselves urged to vote for
Steal, in words like this: —
Mv desire to get into Parliament arises from a
belief that the payment of members is too small.
If elected, I promise to at once move for an increase.
I also undertake to lose no opportunity of getting
hold of any perks that may be lying about. If there
are any billets going which would suit me, I give an
unqualified assurance that I will try to capture the
most healthy-looking one on the list. If elected 1
will devote the whole of my time and energy to
doing everything calculated to benefit myself, secure
the expenditure of as much money as can be secured
for the benefit of my friends and supporters, increase
the cost of government, and push up . the price of
commodities. I will allow nothing to interfere with
my pursuit of a job of some sort, and if by hook or
by crook I get one you can be certain that I will
not be separated from it by anything except dyna-
mite Any fusion or coalition that will assist me to
get all I can for myself and friends will receive
unwavering support. If I can extend my period ot
contract as your representative from three years to
12 I shall do so at once, thus giving myself the
benefit of your support and preventing you haying
anything to say on the subject.. I am in this busi-
ness for myself, and have no time for those indivi-
duals who think I can afford to bother about the
affairs of other people.
If that failed to get Steal through—well,
he would deserve to be left out. lhat it
would be better for a community to be sad-
dled with its Steal after a definite declara-
tion of this sort than to acquire him dis-
guised in a blanket of words which every-
one concerned knows to be a jocular form, ot
perjury, strikes this paper as something
which cannot be argued against.
* * * *
At present the number of Steals on the
landscape is saddening, not because they
have locked themselves in the pantry or
are struggling to get there or are yelling
because they have been flung out, but be-
cause they decorate themselves in the
mantle of patriotism and make fervent
claims to be considered the friends and
servants of the people. In State and f ed-
eral politics the elector can see nothing
but a sordid struggle for place and pay.
Every other consideration but this has
been banished. Every alleged “crisis” and
every issue is being interpreted in terms ot
jobs, of party ascendancy, of how to hang
on. For one word that is heard about the
nation’s affairs a million are poured out
about the tactical movements of the joint
and several Steals. Public men who claim
to be guiding the country’s policy are spend-
ing their days and nights hatching schemes
by which they either cling to office or tear
someone away and take possession of the
job, or manoeuvre themselves into some
other place of profit at the taxpayers
expense. The whole machinery of govern-
ment is being subordinated to this greedy
scramble There are Ministries in Aus-
tralia handling the public cash with a reck-
lessness which if applied to the concerns of
private individuals would reduce them to
beggary. There are Ministries making
statements about the national purse and
issuing public documents of a character that
would bring a trustee within easy reach
of the law. There are others that having
seized the administrative and legislative
apparatus are using it to outrage every
moral and constitutional principle governing
the authority of Parliament, the relation-
ship of a Ministry to the Legislature and
the status of the elector in the scheme ot
representation. The virus that has been
at work these last few years saturates the
body politic. It is a mournful fact that an
enormous number of the electors view the
squalid intrigue of the passing hour—-the
problem of whether some agile dodger or
other will tumble into the soup or another
one be jobbed into a billet; whether this
man or that will squirm out of a hole —as
infinitely more important than the con-
tinued neglect or muddle of Australia’s vital
concerns. In the Commonwealth arena the
questions all the politicians are most inter-
ested in at the moment are whether Hughes
has had his back broken, whether he can
turn a losing hand into. a royal flush,
whether he will hitch up with Cook, and so
on. The nation’s Parliament has degene-
rated into an institution which various
groups are using as a two-up school. It
has throughout its existence systematically
evaded its obligations to the people. It
has been a dismal failure in every respect.
And it is that still—riddled by the disease
of party and demoralised by the idea that
in serving themselves its members serve
Australia. In the State of N. S. Wales the
confession of the politicians that they are
out for plunder is shameless. Their degrada-
tion is absolute, and that of the electors,
first debauched by loans and doles and pawn-
ings, no less so.
* * * *
The Federal Parliament was not elected
as an instrument to be played with by
Hughes or Cook or anyone else. It was
elected to grapple with the affairs .of a
nation and to bring the best brains in the
country to its aid. The N. S. Wales Legis-
lature is not really an outfit maintained for
the purpose of keeping Holman in a job
and providing a soft bed for Gregory Wade
and fobbing Cann and Hoyle on to the
public pay-roll. But the politicians and
their parasites and that large, dull section
of the crowd which can always be counted
on to debase the common standard of citizen-
ship think it is. To the elector entertaining
some ideals regarding the duties and obliga-
tions of public life—looking forward to a
goal that can only be reached if principle
be sternly guarded—to the man who believes
that the politician who cheats the demo-
cracy is more odious than the soldier who
would sell his army, what can all this pros-
titution of political opportunity appear but
a negation of the very foundations on which
the theory of democracy rests? Party
government, instead of being a protection
of the public, has developed into an enemy
so sinister that it threatens, to destroy the
only source from which relief can ever be
looked for. A people who were treacherous
to themselves never yet . mastered the
traitors in the field of politics. The party
politician has Australia to-day by the. throat
and is using against the people their own
votes and ideals. If it be a question of how
to reinforce the army, the erection of a
railway bridge at Dingo Flat, the appoint-
ment of a Minister—anything and every-
thing is poisoned by Party and dealt With
for purposes of personal advantage. Why
not make it compulsory for the spoilers of
democracy to come out into the open and
get authority for the fraudulenee they now
try to conceal by bombast and sham? Hie
people would be no poorer, the politicians
no more guilty.
WHAT BILLJIM SEES.
When Billjim started out with a full kit
of hopes to smash the Kaiser he mostly lett
behind him a cheering crowd, a number ot
excited ferry-boats and a large, shining con-
tinent which looked like business and
seemed anxious to get its sleeves properly
rolled up not only for toil but also for the
national enthusiasm which adds force
its soldiers’ arms. At the. bang of the
war-gong even the frowsiest politicia
looked up from his intrigues for a moment
and the most careless citizen stiffened witn
resolution' as he adjusted the foam on the
beer-pot. Billjim believed that he was
going out to earn a reputation for a country
which was not only the best in the world
but was united in purpose and clean ir }
spirit. To pay the price in sweat and bloou
for standing as representative of such a
concern seemed good enough; and Gaba
Tepe and Pozieres showed what Australia
was able to do when the smoke was thick
with death. All the time Billjim has been look-
ing back to the country of his birth, dream-
ing of his place in the sun, and following
with keen interest between shells the couise
of events in the land he came from. Letters
and papers flutter along the trenches, and
the mental whirl produced by the items ot
news is apt to out-buzz the noisiest missile
that courses overhead.
Australia, which when Billjim left
seemed a large, sunny garden a bit
neglected in spots and with the fences some-
what out of repair but otherwise flourishing,
has now taken on the aspect of a huge dust-
storm careering over a bottomless pit; and
no man engaged in the war turmoil can
say with any sort of certainty w r hat will
remain suspended and what fall through
into the ultimate nothingness before he
gets home. Federal politics, which looked
moderately stable only a few months ago,
splintered into fragments on the proposal
to send Billjim national aid ; the machine
of the Labor party, for the same cause,
reared up on end and sent its own cogs
and pinions flying over the landscape; and
then, to give spice to the situation, the
coal-miners and their employers came to
grips, and, locked in deadly holts, set their
enormous boots on industry and threatened
the land \Hth gross, dinnerless darkness.
Meanwhile in the Nark State, from which
Billjim came in large numbers, politicians
were performing an interesting dance, in
and out through the mazes of constitu-
tional procedure, in a manner which made
the State Governor uneasy arid the public
dizzy with watching. Both in the State
and Federal spheres keen office-seekers
crouched in corners ready to leap into the
place of anybody with a salary who slipped
or skidded in the mad harlequinade; and
the nation’s business, which Billjim be-
lieved on setting forth on his adventure to
be. going along moderately well, is still
waiting for a strong man to come and
do it. But there is no strong man in
sight, and if there was the Labor machine
and the coal strike and the office-seekers
wouldn’t let him get a hearing; so the
solemnly-closed pubs gaze out each evening
on a world that is fast becoming foreign
to them, and they wonder how Australia has
contrived to get so drunk at the very
moment when, following the King, she
should be soberly pushing the war-barrow
up the steep incline.'
* * * *
If Billjim, at his distance from the
scene of the commotion, can’t get all these
things in proper focus the fact is scarcely
to be wondered at. Neither a Hughes
nor a Holman could tell you from hour to
hour where they stand or where they are
likely to stand when the general cyclonic
disturbance has been at play for another
day, and it is scarcely to be expected that
a ‘soldier in the fighting ranks can solve
a conundrum that beats the closest observers
and puzzles even the participants in the
great practical joke. What Billjim can
see, however, and see better than most of
us, is that a tremendous mess is being made
of things in the Commonwealth, and that
if something doesn’t happen with consider-
able suddenness there won’t be any Com-
monwealth, or none that a hard-fighting
Anzac would care about acknowledging.
Take the coal strike alone. That strike
may have nothing to do with _ politics;
yet if things had been politically right there
would have been no coal strike. Further,
no man who has grown accustomed to mili-
tarv discipline in the hour of crisis and a
habit of meeting difficulties and dangers by
prompt action could believe that the states-
men of a nation would be so supine and
feeble as to allow the country to be para-
lysed over a point in dispute so insignificant.
Such a man would arrive at the conclusion
that the people in office were busy about
concerns of there own and didn’t care tup-
pence for the public good—it is _ the only
conclusion he could come to. Right along
the line the same reasoning must apply.
In the eyes of Billjim every crisis which
has arisen must seem to be due to the
triumph of petty and self-seeking office-
hunters and holders over good sense and
the needs of the nation. If parties split
into smaller fragments when they should
sink party altogether, and if work ceases
when efforts should be redoubled, the man
who has gone abroad to risk death and
wounds in the name of the country which
promised to keep the flag flying m his
absence has good ground for indignation,
and Billjim is the sort of person whose
indignation is liable to mean something.
Looked at from the purely personal stand-
point of the Australian soldier, the turn
matters have now taken is pretty grave. We
promised that he should return to his old job
when his fighting was done. On present
appearances there is no guarantee that his
iob Will exist or that people will even re-
member that there was a job.. We promised
to back him up with sufficient reinforce-
ments in order that his danger might not be
too great nor his task too heavy. We are
not backing him on anything like an ad-
equate scale ; and the people, irritated y the
actions of those in authority, and worked
upon by humanitarian enthusiaats who first
demanded the concentration of our powers
on home defence, and now Propose to turn
down home defence altogether, voted out the
proposed conscription which would have
enabled us to keep our promise. Beyond all
these things there must naturally arise m
the mind of Billjim the question whether
he will ever be able to get home again at
all. In the wrangle and turmoil of party,
Australia—or the part of it that draws
official salaries—is quite likely to foi-
get that there is a war going on and
by a combination of Wide-spreading strike
the whole machinery of transport may at
any time cease, leaving the Commonwealth
•is'a “lodge in a garden of cucumbers, a
world-forgetting zealot among the nations
with her eyes set in religious ecstasy on some
minute point of labor detail which is woith
about 2id. to the parties concerned. Bxix-
jim knows his country, and loves it, out tne
thing that he sees is not his country, it is
a huge combine of insane elements holding a
carnival of madness in his country. Just
What he is likely to do about it is by no
means clear; but* Gob help some pohomans
and union leaders —union leadeis on b
dustrial sides—if he gets to it!
THE ABORIGINAL IN MAN AND THE
STRIKE AS A WALKABOUT.
Public policy so far as it finds expression
in the work of Parliament is based on the
principles of wowserism. It assumes that
man is by nature an obedient animal who
can be tied by rules and regulations to his
job and a four-roomed cottage, and that his
instinctive impulse to adorn himself with
vine leaves, fling his tools in the corner and
disport himself like a giddy goat can be
held in subjection by organising cheap tups
to a seaside supply of hot water for _ tea
and swings for the children. Man is obedient
enough, God knows —up to a point. &o are
bulldogs. But put a bulldog on the chain
for six months and feed him twice a day
on good red steak, and if that tyke takes
charge of the neighborhood some bright
morning instead of reposing on the doormat,
all reasonable expectations will be fulfilled.
Put a few score binghis into aU S T'
mer with plenty of tucker, and the bucks
are as sure to have a walk-about as tne
local wallaby is to bolt when he sees his
enemy coming. # *
There are primal instincts in all animals.
If there weren’t there wouldn’t be any ani-
mals And instinct survives most strongly
in man. It is what brought him down out
of the trees. It drives him into the trenches.
Ir is the root reason of the law vacation
which gives the Supreme Court Judge an
excuse for putting off the wig that dis-
guises him and catching the next tram with
an old hat and pants concealed in a bag.
If it were not for that frequent vacation
he would go mad and assault the pro-
thonotary, brain the inner bar with a v© -
ume of jurisprudence and fling the foreman
of the jury through the skylight. Deep in
his soul is the stirring call of the walK-
about. He gets it, as a social precaution.
So with the man Outback, the shopwalker,
the man writing this yarn, the coal-trimmer,
seaman, stockbroker and. parson. lhere
comes a time to them all when they want
air, space, beer, somewhere to turn somer-
saults ; when the daily round becomes
insupportable; when the nerves yell m
remonstrance against suppression. It tney
are not herded together in mobs and still
have freedom of choice they take their holi
day or spell or spree with discreet regard
for other people. When they are not indi-
viduals but crowds they dash off in a wild
stampede. They go on strike. _ They play
the fool and know it. That is what the
miners have been doing. Striking tor a
great principle? Nonsense! They _ were
getting off the chain. The strike is the
miners’ walkabout. At Valparaiso once
there was a lot of trouble aboard a ship
and the mate tried to settle it with a
bucket. Then Hell broke loose. The skipper
fixed matters in 10 minutes by lending the
crew three dollars apiece and the dinghy to
go ashore in. They had been at sea for
three months. He was a wise old Dutch-
man.
* * * *
Consider the miner. He lives in thou-
sands close to his work. Apart from his
toil he has nothing much to do but talk.
His environment creates talk. And it is
always about his job and the boss, when
it isn’t about a dog or the races. Du is
the great industrial introspectiomst ot the
age. He is eternally discontented with coal,
and if he omitted to be very considerably
discontented with himself he would be
something less than human. His work and
conditions of life are unnatural. Herd all
the drapers of Australia together in the
way the miners are herded, and the yearn-
ing of even these mild fellows to go on the
rampage would become very real and dan-
gerous. Everywhere men or women are
lumped in a mass it is the same, whether
they be Newcastle hewers of coal, London
dockers or N’York shirtmakers. Let us
have Arbitration Courts and sane methods
and a reasonable decency in citizenship by
all means; but let us not make these an
excuse for overlooking how the chain galls
even the most patient. Let us recognise the
artificiality of things in general, remember
that the meekest of men has blood in his
body and that the tomcat insists on leaving
the hearthrug for the roof; and let the
walkabout be given an honored place m all
the regimentation and schemes for supplying
the citizens' with gas and bread and news-
papers. * * *
Once every year places like Newcastle
and Broken Hill should be shut up for a
month—mines, shops, houses and ofliees.
Every place that might conceal a human
being should be cleared and the population
supplied with enough cash and clean linen
to last until the whistle blew by order
of the Court. And every citizen should be
compelled to go away to a distant place and
fish or bathe or punt at the races, but on
no account to hold any corroboree or debate
or sit down and chew the cud of misery and
woe. Every industrial suburb should be
treated the same way, and the inhabitants
emptied out at Bourke or Oodnadatta or
Cooktown, and Brisbane should be deposited


in Melbourne, and Melbourne into Coota-
mundra, and Sydney into Gundagai, and
every citizen in the land compelled to join
their honors of the Court of Appeal in a
vacation which would restore their mental
balance, give their digestion a chance and
let the instinct to leap giddily about the
mountain tops have a fair chance of assert-
ing itself, instead of being corked up and
wired down and otherwise maltreated. This
would be one of the greatest investments a
State ever made for ameliorating the hard
lot of the mob and keeping the country free
from snarls and cat-fights. And it would be
only a fair deal. Consider the increased
.efficiency that would follow—the zest with
which the toiler would return to his toil,
the eagerness with which he would look
forward every year to the coming weeks of
joyfulness and caper and handspring. And
it would pay handsomely—not Fat perhaps,
but the citizens in their corporate capacity.
Also it would convert the w r orker into a
man with something more to do than grouch.
Even a coach-horse gets turned-out occa-
sionally.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Hughes Junta.
Still another pretty sample of the bless-
ings of party government was spread out
for exhibition last week. Hughes having
been thrown out of the Labor party, Maiion
and O’Malley followed Tudor and Higgs,
who had resigned previously; and the “re-
construction” of the Government was neces-
sary. But, though this is a time when
Australia needs a Ministry composed of the
strongest men and most experienced admin-
istrators in its public life, the curse of party,
added to Hughes’s colossal conceit, has
saddled the country for a fortnight at any
rate with the poorest thing in the way of a
Government that the Commonwealth has ever
had. Hughes’s head has been so completely
turned that the little man no doubt believes
himself indispensable; therefore, when he
found himself leading the poorest section of
the House—poorest both numerically and
intellectually—it apparently didn’t occur to
him that, as an alleged democrat, it was his
plain duty to retire from the job. Had he done
as Holman did, and found a majority else-
where, well and good. Instead, he chose a
Ministry to represent his own rag-tag of a
following, and at a time when Australia
needs its best men he is satisfied, so long as
he can remain Premier, that the other offices
shall be filled by derelicts, by men who have
been proved incompetent and by others who
have given so little promise as administrators
that Mr. Hughes and his late caucus never
trusted them with a job even in normal
times. That Hughes should, have a place
in a National Government this paper at any
rate has no doubt at all. But to submit
that it doesn’t matter who else is either in
or out of the Government so long as Hughes
is head of it is quite another proposition.
In theory, at any rate, we are still a demo-
cracy, thank Heaven, not an autocracy gov-
erned by two administrative failures.

A New Party Falls Over an Old
Precipice.
The opposition to the llolman-Wade Gov-
ernment in the N. S. Wales Assembly suc-
ceeded in making a triumphant ass of itself
at the first time of asking. Against the
Grab party in office the Opposition has an
excellent case, which it at once proceeded to
weaken. The Electric Light and Emergency
Bill introduced by the Government embodied
the reasonable project of conserving the use
of the limited quantity of coal available at
the end of last week for the manufacture of
gas and electric current. The proposal was to
relieve the Corporation of Sydney and the
gas companies from the risk of claims for
damages in the event of their discontinuing
to supply current or gas, and to limit the
supply to certain essential services. The idea
was so sound that it could hardly be chal-
lenged. But because they were in Opposi-
tion, and because the Bill came from the
Government, the crowd, on the other side
burst into wild denunciation and whirling
talk about “nationalising the mines” and
“immediately passing a new bank-to-bank
amendment to the Mining Act,” and for
many hours persisted in being an affront to
commonsense. It was a shocking start. The
State Government’s responsibility to the
community—its responsibility for making the
best of a serious position—was definite. For
it to have allowed coal to be used up in
producing current and gas for dozens of
non-essential purposes, and thus cut down
the reserve for use in essentials, such as
water supply and the preservation of food,
would have been criminal. And the people
who blew off hot air knew it. But it was
party government, and Durack and his fol-
lowers bowed down and worshipped the
idol in its most grotesque shape.
♦ ■
Australia’s Wireless Chain.
Now that Australia’s wireless telegraph
service is under the Navy Department’s con-
trol, the stations should be rearranged.
What is to be gained by maintaining two
stations of about equal power Avithin five
miles of each other, as at Williamstown and
Melbourne? Again, on the Sydney side,
Garden Island, the lately-purchased Father
Shaw station at RandAvick, and the high-
power factory at Carlingford, are like a
party in a parlor, all talking and all damned.
Dual control, by the Post Office and the
Navy, was the original reason for these
duplications. Under the present system of
management, which should have obtained
from the beginning, there is no excuse for
perpetuating the expensive folly. In fact,
to maintain Sydney’s three stations in their
present positions would be about as sen-
sible as running three post offices in a row.
There are numbers of places along the
coast to which these spare stations could
be transferred. Australia’s coast stations
were placed so that coastwise vessels, in any
position, could establish daylight communi-
cation with one or other of them. But there
are many gaps in the chain. Ships bound
from Sydney to Brisbane, or vice versa, are
completely out of wireless touch the day
after sailing. A station about Grafton
would bridge this gap. The Mataram, when
aground near Thursday Island some time
ago, was unable to “raise” the Island sta-
tion. A favorable condition carried her
howl for help to Port Moresby station, which
relayed it back to Thursday. There are
many other blanks in the daylight chain.
Ability to establish communication with
shore at any time is an important matter
in waters where the one-operator foolishness
is permitted. Therefore, to continue three
stations in a heap, when long stretches of
coast are voiceless and deaf, is inexcusable.
In the event of a big wreck it would look
like criminal neglect.
*
If Australia Were an Archipelago!
Thebe are innumerable factors to influence
the. mind in regard to such a matter as con-
scription, ranging between humanitarian
idealism and cold feet, but one of the largest
of the lot is geographical situation. Bring a
man up in any European country where the
I rontier guards face each other, almost with-
in coo-ee of everybody, and everybody knows
that the person on the other side of the
fence is disposed to be nasty directly he sees
an opening, then the average man notices no
hardship in being obliged to keep himself
in fit condition for being nasty in return.
Take a little democracy like Switzerland,
which wouldn’t exist any time if the cost of
taking it were not likely to considerably out-
weigh the. value of the capture, and instead
of its . being regarded as an undemocratic
proposition for each citizen to be liable to
military service, the abnegation of the rights
of the individual in favor of the State are
made with alacrity and fervor. The render-
ing of military service in Switzerland is an
honor, not a burden, and in consequence its
defence system combines economy and effi-
ciency to such a high degree that even
Germany looks on it as prickly-pear country.
But a large land like Australia, with no
boundaries over which a frontier guard peers,
and with illimitable spaces “behind,” is apt
to imagine that disturbances 12,000 mips
away are of little importance, and if the worst
ever comes to the worst there is plenty of
room at the rear. Within enormous seaboard
and a small population, the fact that its only
effective safeguard is the naval supremacy of
a country on the opposite side of the globe
doesn’t stand out and hit anybody in the eye
as it would if the danger were closer and the
continent not so bulky. In the smaller island
possessions, where more people proportion-
ately are in sight of the sea daily, and there
isn’t so much back country, practically no-
body wants to argue about the matter at all.
Everybody knows that when the sea is lost
all is lost. In Maoriland, when the war broke
out. the phrase one most commonly heard was
“Thank God, there is an Australian Navy!
That may protect us.” The sense of isola-
tion and total dependence on sea-power was,
so to speak, in the air. Everybody felt it,
and nobody denied it. Again, Tasmania, of
all the States usually the most averse to
innovation, threw Conservatism and ancient
British prejudices overboard when it came to
conscription ; while Norfolk Island, with its
165 Yeses to 12 Noes, showed emphatically
what its opinion is. Apparently if Australia
had been an archipelago instead of a large
compact portion of the globe, there would
have been only about one opinion concerning
its defence.
The Conscripts in the Home Shambles.
According to Father Bernard Vaughan, a
child dies in the British Islands from prevent-
able or partly preventable causes for every
bullet or shell-splinter that carries death to
a British soldier. It is a forceful way of
putting that calamity of national neglect
which must count so much in the future.
England reduced the rate of infant mortal-
ity from 150 per 1000 in 1900 to 95 per 1000
in 1912; but the figures are still alarmingly
big, and in 1914 there were 92,166 babies
lost out of 878,822 born. Father Vaughan
attributes, the national loss to intemperance,
late marriage, self-indulgence and gross prac-
tices ; but he could have thrown ignorance
and the utter indifference of people in
authority into the scale without quarrelling
with truth. In Australia the figures are 71
and in Maoriland 51 per 1000; so, though
things are better at this end of the world,
there is still nothing to be glad about. The
problem of immigration after the war and
the settlement of our wide empty lands
ought to fall into second place while the
Australian-born child is being allowed to
fall out of the race before he even grasps the
first great principles of party government.
Here, as in Britain, muddle and public in-
difference are the chief causes making for
the loss, and they have their outward show-
ing in the general ignorance of all things
connected with the child. In some States—
notably N. S. Wales, thanks largely to
George Black —organisations are working
earnestly to get a little light into the mind
of the mother and maiden aunt who are in
charge; but there won’t be any great illumi-
nation till the darkness is expelled from the
public mind. The community as a whole
doesn’t yet care what becomes of the other
fellow’s child; and until it does care, and
realises that that neglected infant is one of
its own priceless possessions, we shall
read figures that stagger us. If people could
understand that the go-cart and back-yard
have casualty-lists nearly as big as those
which come from the hell created by Wil-
helm, the Baby Clinic would have more
supporters than the Red Cross.
+. —j
And Baby Industries, too.
If Australia is ever to make much manufac-
turing progress it must look after the baby
industries. At present the vote-hunting
politician mostly disregards them. There
was a coal strike last week, and because
there were a lot of l_ -i concerned the Gov-
ernments took a fairly prompt hand, the
Federal authority called a compulsory
conference, the Prime Minister presided over
it and the newspapers had columns and
columns about the parties’ misconduct in
flouting the Arbitration law. At that very
moment the ironmoulders had been out on
strike for no less than nine weeks; but be-
cause the industries affected were mostly
in the infant class the flouting of the law in
that case was almost entirely disregarded.
One enterprising inter-State company, strug-
gling to get for Australia a trade which had
been hitherto very largely German, had put
much money into an enamelling plant. The
works had been in operation only two
months, under conditions which were admit-
ted by the employees to be reasonable, when
the ironmoulders’ strike occurred, and the
whole thing had to be shut down and has
remained shut down for longer than it was
in operation. But because it was a little
one, there has been no popular howl about
it; the Commonwealth Government, which is
supposed to be the special guardian of manu-
facturing industries,' has disregarded the
whole pitiful disorganisation as completely
as if it had occurred in Labrador; there has
been no compulsory conference; there has
been nothing—except a promising infant in-
dustry throttled, and a warning hoisted
against capitalists putting any more money
into manufacturing plant. Meantime we
have a Prime Minister who almost foams at
the mouth about the necessity for destroying
German trade.
The Problem of the Wheat Crop,
The new wheat is now coming in to the
country railway-stations in the early dis-
tricts, and a matter of a few weeks will see
the grain pouring into every township in the
wheat country throughout the Common-
wealth. This grain is to be pooled, as it was
last year, and the cocky wants to know what
advance he is to get. With sublime confi-
dence in the puissance of Governments, he
takes it for granted there will be an advance,
and impatiently waits to know the amount.
So far, however, there has been an ominous
silence on the part of the authorities. And
no wonder! From the previous crop the
pool received some 53,814,000 bags, and with
so little success has it been handled that on
November G there were still 30,786,000 bags
in the stacks, or considerably more than half
the total crop. On top of this the new crop
is coming in. It is too early to talk definitely,
but on present appearances there is a pro-
spect of the Commonwealth harvesting be-
tween 40 and 45 million bags. At the most,
as mentioned just now, the pool financed 54
million bags last year. There will be, after
allowing for something for home consump-
tion, 27 million bags to be yet disposed of or
carried into next season. With another 40
million bags at least of new season’s wheat,
there will thus be 67 million bags to finance
—less a few millions that may be sold and
exported between now and the middle of
January. We can thus rely on having to
finance from 12 to 15 million bags more than
we did last year when the pool’s holding was
at its maximum ; and the extra £ s. d. will
be more than the addition of 12 to 15
million bags would suggest, because of the
further 6d. per bushel which has been
advanced since the first payment was made

financial problem ahead of us ; and there is
going to be something like chaos in the coun-
try if it isn’t very promptly dealt with.

Marshall Lyle on a ghost that won’t be
still
Why do Melbourne men seem to lose their senses
when the Deeming case is referred to ? “0.K.,” who
is presumably some Melbourne citizen, writes (B.
2/11/’l6) as if homicide should be viewed as a
sport. Don’t let us trouble about law or justice,
or truth or science! And whether a man who is
punished is guilty or innocent makes no difference;
just kill him if you feel inclined to! It is our
duty to kill those we feel are dangerous to us, and
those we fear! And so “0.K.” joins such com-
pany as the Clan-na-Gael in U.S.A., who murdered
the supposed spy, Dr. Cronin ; the Irish Invincibles
who murdered Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr.
T. H. Burke ; the terrible sect of the Assassins of
the 12th century; and every other follower of Cain.
Notwithstanding this, I doubt not that “0.K.” is a
highly respectable, orthodox Melbourne gentleman
who would not kill a bluebottle or harm a vulgar
little fly.
“O.K.’s” comments reflect upon my contest with
the Crown, and he asks some questions I can answer.
“0.K.” does not attempt to support the Crown
case against the accused, which was that Deeming
was an ordinary, normal, sane human being. “0.K.”
says Deeming could not have been sane all the
time. In so far he agrees with me, and even admits,
as against the Crown, that I was right in maintain-
ing that Deeming was an epileptic. But “0.K.”
fails to support me in the demand that Deeming
was entitled to a fair trial according to law, or
that I should have been permitted to show before
his condemnation that this supposedly sane being
was really an escapee from a lunatic asylum. Nor
does my critic disclose any sense of public danger
in the press of a country being permitted to take
a case out of the hands of the Courts, and to pre-
judge and condemn a man before he is tried. He
does not challenge my assertion that what the
press served up to the people of Melbourne was
mostly false, and often fraudulent, and that the
public was misled. But he contents himself by
reflecting that in the end what was done to Deeming
was the best thing for murderous lunatics—to hang
them. Of course it is obvious that the elimination
from society of murderous lunatics is a good thing.
A lethal chamber should be part of every lunatic
asylum if it were not that our experience has
taught us that Government agencies and all political
parties are too open to corruption. Under these
circumstances we are only safe in denying the right
of Government to kill its subject without a fair
trial according to law. The end does not justify
the means. If it be good to hang all irresponsible
lunatics, the law should be altered accordingly.
Until it is so altered, the hanging of an irresponsible
lunatic is itself a crime.
“0.K.” questions whether, assuming the lunatic’s
counsel had been permitted to produce the available
evidence of insanity, it would have made any
difference. AVould a fair trial have prevented the
hanging ? I have to reply that it was impossible to get
Deeming a fair trial unless the Court stopped the
press from comment on the case and denunciation
of the accused, and gave the public a chance of
reflection. It is necessary for me to lift the veil.
I? Deeming’s trial had been postponed to the next
criminal sittings, it would have commenced
before a Judge who would have silenced the Mel-
bourne press and defied the passions of the mob.
Before this Judge and others due or liable to take
the list there was every chance of justice. In his
modest home in Murphy-street, South Yarra, there
lived a man. A friend of mine, the late Dr. S.
Mannington Cappyn, was a frequent visitor there,
at the family home of George Higinbotham, Chief'
Justice of Victoria. I learnt from Caffyn that:
Higinbotham was very angry with the newspapers!
. for condemning the prisoner as sane and guilty
before he was tried. Caffyn told ine a character-
istic story of the Chief’s anger, and became quite
eloquent when he contemplated Higinbotham send-
ing off to gaol David Syme, Haddon, S. V. Winter,
and Jimmie Thompson, and fining them £lOOO
each. I had also other information.
I say now that if the Court had passed an
adequate judicial condemnation on the newspapers,
then with the evidence available Deeming would
never have been hanged. Purves, Q.C., was of this
opinion. Deeming would have been sent to join the
other homicidal lunatics in the Yarra Bend Asylum
and would have increased by one more the number of
lunatics we already keep safely locked up—some
16,000 and more in Australia. When “0.K.” asks
me if it is just to the warders to send lunatics for
them to look after, I have to remind him that this
is the duty of asylum attendants and that it is
safer work than many industrial occupations, inclu-
ding the building trades. When “0.K.” complains
that it is not fair to imprison such a man for 20
years and then let him out, I have to inform him
that there is no such thing as imprisoning lunatics
for 20 years or any definite term. They are con-
signed to asylums for ever, and they remain there
until they die. The certainty of a homicidal lunatic
who is consigned to an asylum remaining there till
he dies is much greater than the chance that a man
charged with murder will ever be hanged.
But will any amount of reasoning with them ever
cure the Melbourne people who suffer from Deem-
entia ?

From a communication trench: —
One thing said by Wade in connection with the
formation of a Lib.-Lab. Ministry in N. S. Wales is
absolutely true: “I made no bargain.” And one
remark made by Holman is as true as gospel: “The
question of appointing an Agent-General has never
been considered by Cabinet.” When the twain first
met to consider ways and means of abducting the
bacon, Holman said: “Well, of course it is possible.
You could take the job in L0nd0n....” Where-
upon Wade wrung Holman’s hand, and looking him
square in the eye, man to man and heart to heart,
said: “Let us drop that subject here and now. 1
make no bargain. It is our business to carry on the
war. Mind, no bargain.” And Holman wrung
Wade’s hand and said “Ri’buck,” or words to that
effect. A week later, at a meeting of Cabinet, some-
body asked how things were going, and whether
Wade would accept the billet if it were thrust upon
him. “I do not know,” replied Holman. “I have
not asked him. We have agreed that there must be
no bargaining. It would be most improper.” “Quite
right!” chirruped Davy Hall. “Most improper!”
“Now, look here, Wade, when you go to London,”
started Holman next morning. But Wade held up
his hand and murmured, “No bargaining, Holman.
Let us not smirch our record with even the sug-
gestion that I wanted anything.” Both of them
observed the understanding like gentlemen; and
when all the jobs that had to be handed round
were disposed of, one job remained. Also one patriot
who had taken nothing. “I was never so surprised
in all my life,” he said afterwards. “Of course, I
had hopes, but that the Government should have
shown me this singular mark of attention is really
astonishing. It came quite unsolicited, and there
was no bargaining.” Why, even Wade’S purchase of
217 portmanteaus was misinterpreted. He only
wanted them to use on week-ends.

“David H. Rundle,” from California:—
Australian Governments—Federal or State—r-should
follow the U.S. system of agricultural education and
university extension work. School-teachers in the
majority of States must pass a solid examination
in agriculture. Many universities distribute corres-
pondence courses on various phases of agriculture, and
are mostly free. Numerous bulletins are published ;
in fact, so complete is the system that the man
on the land can get almost any technical instruc-
tion he wants by his fireside and put its teachings
into practice at his work, the universities answering
any questions he may care to send them. As ar
Australian of 30 months’ experience here, while
specialising- in fruit-growing and marketing, I have
secured the following practically free:—Six weeks
short course in horticulture at Californian Univer-
sity Farm ; correspondence instruction on alfalfa and
citrus growing, pear culture, canning and preserv-
ing, rice-growing (these from the University of Cali-
fornia) ; a special course on the farm and farm
home, from Cornell University, New York; and
upwards of a hundred bulletins from universities
stretching from Oregon to Florida. The U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture was allotted £5,000,000
this year, so it can afford to give away knowledge
freely. Instruction on the above easy lines would
be productive of greater and more lasting benefit
to our Australia than any number of commission
picnics to U.S.A.

“X.Y.” tells tlie story of a pleasant and
painstaking German scientist:—
In B. 2/11/’l6 “T.McM.” tells of a German raid
on the rare and valuable orchids of Torres Strait.
Here are the facts of a similar raid, carried out with
the terrible completeness of the same German system.
Some 25 years ago the great Dorrigo, or as it was
then called the Don Dorrigo, was virgin bush. One
day a German came to the Bellinger River (N.S.W.)
and proceeded to explore the bush. He had his head-
quarters in one of the small local towns, from which
he- used to set out with black and half-caste guides.
He gave out that he was a naturalist, and had Gov-
ernment permission to collect birds, etc. Presently
he bad quite a staff of helpers. Their sole work
seemed to consist of the collection of a vine growing
in the bush, and locally known by the name of
“Bob’s Vine.” It had a profusion of green leaves
which could be dried in the sunlight without losing
their color. Under the master’s instructions the
natives took the whole vine, leaves, stems, roots and
all. The German explained to inquirers that he had
an interest in a dye factory, and was searching for
a vegetable green which would not fade when exposed
to sunlight—a very plausible story. He had re-
ceived a medical training, and gave his services freely
and gratuitously, and this was a real boon. He soon
became the most popular man in the district. He
kept quite a number of animals, not only marsupials,
but also ordinary domestic pets. After two years’
residence the district was denuded of “Bob’s Vine.”
Towards the end of the period some of the local resi-
dents the Department concerned, and a man
was sent up to investigate. The last consignment
was then on its way to U burg, so the German had
no objection to taking the official into his confidence.
At that time, and for some years previously, there
had been a failure the English and Continental
hop crop, with the result that brewers were at their
wits’ end to provide a substitute. Many substances
containing bitter principles were used, but none gave
satisfactory results. Australian brewers used strych-
nine, with the result that one man was killed at

Albury (N.S.W.) and many others were affected. In
the Albury case a pint of the beer was found to con-
tain two grains of strychnine, which had become con-
centrated at the bottom of the cask. Our amiable
German friend had been all over the world in search
of a bitter principle which would be sufficiently
powerful and at the same time give no poisonous
result in use. He found it in “Bob’s Vine.” With
characteristic thoroughness he had tried it upon his
animals, then upon his non-paying patients, and,
finally, upon himself. He said in parting it would
return him “enough to make him ■ comfortable
always.” That is the sort of man we’ll have to
compete with again when the guns cease. Heard any-
thing about a skyscraping tariff lately?

The “all-in” stage is arriving for all hands
—except Australia. The German is taking
his shirt off for a large, comprehensive effort,
and the discreet cable messages distributed
by John Bull leave no doubt that the
people in Britain see they must bend their
backs to the vast job as they never ex-
pected they would have to. Thar first pro-
blem John had to deal with was the supply
of munitions; the next was the supply of
men. Now while acquiring more men he
must maintain the national food supplies,
and at the same time keep prices at a reason-
able level. The destruction of shipping is
going on at a smart gait, and it would be
plain foolishness to pretend that the results
are not becoming very unpleasant. So, for
one reason and another, there are more un-
likely things than that the whole volume of
Britain’s imported food supply will presently
be on Government account, and that distri-
bution will be on some variation of the Ger-
man meat-ticket system. And Australia —
what of Australia? We, who started off so
magnificently, we who made the whole world
wonder—-we have quitted. It is no use pre-
tending that the bulk of us are now taking
any serious interest in the winning of the
war. We are not only doing nothing of any
consequence in the way of securing rein-
forcements, but the country is torn by
strikes, and we are holding up shipping, and
thus actually dragging down the Allies. It
is an almost tragic position; and the sooner
the leaders of the three parties in the Com-
monwealth Parliament meet and talk it over
the better. That the management of the
affairs of the country should remain in the
hands of men who have brought it to this
appalling state is unthinkable. The crisis
demands a National Government, drawn from
the Labor party and every other party which
can supply brains and experience and help
to get hold of public confidence.
The confident predictions of S.A. Premier
Vaughan that Jethro Brown was not in
earnest in resigning as president of the In-
dustrial Court, seem to be justified. The
salary has now been raised to £l7OO (but
without any promise of a Judgeship), and it
is understood that the resignation is to be
withdrawn.
In Sydney this week the newspapers have
been crawling out with difficulty. On Mon-
day the coal-strike robbed them of electric-
power and on Tuesday morning gas power
was shut off, too. Then the snort of the
oil engine was heard in back lanes and base-
ments, and the presses slowly gave to the
world the latest scratchings and a few inci-
dental references to the progress of civilisa-
tion. The Bulletin has suffered with the
rest.
Hail to the Strong Man, nerved for the
occasion! Being invited to say what he
proposed to do in the matter of the strike
at the Wonthaggi State coal-mine, Premier
Peacock “realised that the dispute is one
that must be dealt with by the Common-
wealth.” It concerns the Commonwealth
closely, but one would have thought that, as
the representative of the owners, he would
at least have asked his employees what their
grievances were, and, if they had none, what
the dickens they meant by striking. Pontius
Pilate Peacock !
Mrs. Llavelock Ellis, who lately died
in England, was something more than just
the wife of the great writer on sex, being
herself a woman of culture and ideas. Her
one-act plays, “Kit’s Woman” and “The Sub-
jection of Kezia,” ran for six months in
London, at the Court Theatre, and just
before her final illness she had founded a
new film company which was to employ
the cinema in the interest of art and edu-
cation and for propaganda work.
Facing in succession sand, mosquitoes and
flood, two young women have ridden 430
miles in 15 days for the fun of the thing.
The migratory pair are Mrs. C. C. Whiteley
and Miss J. F. Taylor, and their track was
from Mildura to Melbourne via Ouyen.
After passing through the sand and insects
they reached the southern mallee, where for
two days they splashed through water. In-
cluding a day’s spell, they covered 320 miles
in eight days. Then, after three days’ rest,
they tackled the last hundred miles, 40 of
them being made like 80 by the heavy rains
in the Dividing Range. Having reached
Melbourne they rode back to Woodend, mak-
ing an even 430 miles of it.

After the brief “ Romance ” of Madge

more to a typical U.S.A. drama, as like
all other American dramas as it can pos-
sibly be. Somebody in “ Madame X.”
pictured a lawyer finding his missing
mother in the criminal he was defending
in court. In “Common Clay,” produced
for the first time on Saturday evening,
Cleves Kinkead had the happy idea of
reversing the incident, and making a pro-
secuting lawyer discover his unsuspected
daughter in the witness-box. Now it is
up to another foreign dramatist to show
us the defendant in a breach of promise
case recognising his long-mislaid washer-
lady in the court charwoman, or the mur-
derer in the dock discovering that the
person wearing the black cap is his twin
brother. It is only a matter of stretching
the hairy arm of coincidence far enough.

And Cleves Kinkead has no qualms
about over-working that long hairy arm.
The plot really doesn’t matter any more
than the epilogue. What does matter is
the character of Ellen Neal. This girl,
brought up in hopelessly sordid surround-
ings, yearns for the pleasure and gaiety of
youth. But these are only for the rich.
She frequents a low-down drinking-place,
and contact with the gilded youth of the
city results, almost inevitably, in her
seduction. Warned by the Judge to get
away from these bad surroundings, and
sincerely determined to go straight, the
girl takes a place as a housemaid in a
wealthy family. But the first evening she
arrives she is kissed by the butler, meets
the youth, now drunk, who seduced her,
and “ falls ” again to the son of her
employers. In the next act we learn that
there is a baby, and the mother deter-
mines that the father shall support their

child as if it were legitimate. But the law-
yers engaged contrive to keep the man
and girl apart, and try to compromise
the matter. The only consequence is that
the girl determines to ruin her first seducer
and apparently the original case drops out
of sight, with the baby. But the case has
its uses, since the son’s lawyer discovers
that the girl is his daughter. The play
should end here ; but there is a silly
epilogue obviously introduced to make
amends for the sudden suppression
of the alleged hero, who fades off the
stage early in the second act, and to
bring the father and mother of the
unseen child together again.

Florence Rockwell, the foreign lead, is
admirable in her characterisation of this
unattractive part. She gives an even
performance without startling the audi-
ence with any great gifts of dramatic
expression. Frank Harvey is wasted
in this play, for two of the men have
much more important parts. Louis Kim-
ball gives an admirable character study
of a weak type of youth making his first
appearance while drunk. He makes a
convincing drunk. Arthur Styan, as the
lawyer, has the whole of the second
and most of the third act upon his
capable shoulders. He is easy, natural
and experienced, adding another of his
outstanding character studies to his honor-
able Australian record. D. J. Williams,
as the opposing lawyer, is quite out of
place. Maggie Knight, in the court
scene, gives impressiveness to an impor-
tant scene. The rest of the cast matters
little, but discloses few weaknesses.

The revival of Allan Wilkie’s “Hamlet”
in Melbourne on Saturday night, if it
lacked a little of the nervous force of the
previous first-night effort, seemed a little
more finished and matter-of-fact. Wilkie
gets right inside the character of the
young man who, having suspected that
his father’s death was not due to a snake
in the grass, as the medical certificate
stated, is put wise on the subject by the
deceased monarch’s revengeful Ghost.
The actor is so personally convincing that
he fills the surroundings with realism.
His habit of elocuting “ ma ” for “my”
is perhaps due to Caledonian causes, but
it may be allowed to pass as an ancient
Danish characteristic. His comparative
weakness in the scene with his too-
amorous mother can be excused on the

ground that Miss Sydney, as Gertrude
aforesaid, is the least sympathetic mem-
ber of the cast. No Hamlet could get any
inspiration from a stormy interview with a
mother who shows so little sense of her
painful position. For the rest there are two
or three changes in the effect of the per-
formance. John Cosgrove, formerly a
plump, cheery villain of a King, is now
admirable in two minor parts. He
appears as First Player, and then he pops
up as a new type of First Gravedigger
who looks a mighty fine digger for such
a little bit of a hole in the stage.

H. Dore is a well-spoken Horatio with no
sort of importance about him, not even
fussy importance; consequently his
crowning of Hamlet’s dead head nar-
rowly escapes a smile. Edward Lan-
dor’s Polonius is consistent and interest-
ing because it glaringly reveals the fact
that garrulous old Polony was really a
stereotyped Shakspearian cloyvn, dis-
guised in a long beard and a billet of
brief authority. Vivian Edwards plays
bad King Claudius this time. He is an
improvement in the stage picture, but his
diction sounds strange to blank verse,
and Vivian is painfully casual in his
manner of trying to turn to penitence
and then admitting that a king can’t
make his prayers fly higher than the ceil-
ing if his thoughts stay below in the
basement. Walter Hunt is a spirited
effusive Laertes as before. The Ghost
makes far too long a mouthful of “Fare-
wel-1-1-1.” Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
Marcellus and Bernardo are much more
efficient than Osric, who evidently can’t
imagine how a Kyrle Bellew could de-
corate such a character. Miss Ney is a
graceful silent messenger, Miss Harvey a
pretty Player Queen with a tendency to,
drop the last syllable of every line, and
Miss Hunter-Watts is a more sweet and
pathetic Ophelia than ever she was.
There is no freshness of youth in this
Ophelia, but she is a charming sample of
mild young womanhood at first, and a
beautifully gentle lunatic later on.
“WHILE THE BILLY BOILS” AT
MELBOURNE KING'S.

“ The Silver King,” at Melbourne
Royal, is*a hardy evergreen which flour-
ishes in any soil and never gets frost-
bitten. Even the anomalous “ gagging ”
of Elijah Coombe and Cripps the lock-
smith, who speak of motor-cars as though
the old melodrama were quite modern,
does little or no damage to such a deep-
rooted attraction. The story of how
Wilfred Denver became g, millionaire
through getting very drunk, whereas he
had promised to be a hopeless case, is
the best of all the optimistic stage stories
of its kind, and the pay-box bears witness
to the fact. Therefore it seems hardly
necessary to revive “The Sign of the
Cross ” on Saturday for the last week of
the Julius Knight season. “The Sign”
is advertised, however, and Julius may
be expected to Superbus once again.

At Melbourne Majesty’s they are pre-
paring to shunt “ The Cinema Star ” and
revive “The Orchid,” which will come as
a novelty to many people. Saturday
brings the change of bill.
“While the Billy Boils” is in its third
week at Melbourne King’s, and the usual
matinee will happen next Wednesday. Bob

philanthropic Bulletin contributor that
ever was, and in so far as the simple play

cream on the surface thereof.

sionism by Miss H. Irvine, the artistic
sister of the Icicle. Miss Irvine is a
pupil of the late Phillips Fox, and echoes
her master without achieving all his
memorable charm. Perhaps a symptom
of her brother’s flintiness prevents her
conceding anything to compromise when
delineating her fellow-creatures. The
only sitter she flatters is her august rela-
tive, and she only makes him less austere,
lor the most part her other studies are
indecisive impressions, some of them
struggling for elucidation in a swirl of
vivid pigment. Her men are the best,
the strong painting and modelling being
especially noteworthy in the case of a
picture of a Russian student. Her women
are Frenchily depicted, but are not very
comely. In her zest for color and atmos-
phere she frequently allows the features
to fade into non-committal nothingness.
“ Madame B.” and a couple of others are
possible exceptions, but even in those
instances the portrait is subsidiary to the
painting. Miss Irvine’s form of art is
almost illegible, so to speak, in her studies
of market-places and cathedral interiors ;
still the color is there, and the canvases
further have the virtue of an honest inten-
tion. Her water-colors are admirable
when she has anything to report; but
when she has nothing particular to say,
her art is mere smudge.
The dogged continuance of old turns
and the reappearance of others that have
lost their novelty deepen The Bulletin’s
weariness when it looks in at Melbourne
Tivoli. To replace the departed Strollers
the Mclntosh management had nothing
better to offer on Saturday than a bunch
of revivals, whereof the most striking was
Ella Caspers in a bracket of four songs
tastefully rendered with the help of a
Belgian accompanist. Other resurrections
are the Parshleys, the xylophoning duet,
and Prince and Deerie, the Yankee pifflers
who always giggle to show where the
laughs are expected. Also Marie King-
Scott is there again for the fourth or fifth
time within a few weeks. Marie is an
entertainment, but still it must be ad-
mitted that she is beginning to look like
a rash.

The Dandies are still praying for warm
weather at St. Kilda (Vic.). Last week
the temperature would have been chilly
to a Polar bear, and on two evenings the
grief of the heavens made Manager Brock
think seriously of serving out oilskins
and sea-boots. Despite the unseasonable
misery, however, Brock’s people continue
to be smart and cheerful, their programme
on Saturday being the happiest they have
given to date.

Hoyt s topliner in Melbourne this week
is “The Pretenders,” a five-reel Metro
film featuring the efforts of a bogus earl
to get his imposture endorsed in Sassiety.
dhe picture is crowded with high living
and Adirondack scenery, and the dirty
work of finished crooks alternates with
passages of idyllic rapture between Emmy
Wchlen and the leading man. Emmy is
most distracting in this story. Her smile
even makes the star criminal feel purer
and sets policemen thinking of Higher
Things. Virginia Pearson is the madden-
ing motive of the trouble in the Fox
special, “Hypocrisy,” but there is not
enough acting in it to keep a lady like
Virginia warm. At Hoyt’s Olympia,
“ The Mysteries of Myra ” serial is a
growing sensation. Ihe second spasm
on Saturday, which specialises further in
occult homicide, is gruesome enough to
terrify the young of all ages.
Galsworthy’s “Pigeon,” played by the
Adelaide Repertory Theatre, is a bird
that flaps about a good deal without
arriving anywhere. Not that a work of
art really needs to arrive at any definite
conclusion; but, then, the author has
the air of propounding a social problem,
with the solution always somewhere just
round the corner. A gentle middle-aged
painter is the Pigeon of the title, but the
derelicts he tries to help are no hawks.
A hopelessly immoral girl, a hopelessly
tipsy old man and a gentle philosophic
French tramp (straight out of a Locke
novel), they are all down-and-outers.
They are no use alive, they would them-
selves rather be dead, and Society is
derided for putting them in gaol when
they try in a futile way to commit suicide.
Three philanthropists of varying views are
slightly farcical; in fact, the Pigeon’s
practical young daughter unexpectedly
brackets the whole lot as “the six rotters ”
She makes him move in order to avoid
them, but he weakly gives his new
address to all of them; and the
play ends on a small practical joke
worthy of Zangwill at his weakest.
Unless, indeed, Galsworthy means to
imply that Life is a poor joke. James
Anderson played the unheroic hero
cleverly; he has borrowed most of
Wilfred Neill’s methods, including his
sole weakness of over-deliberation. Neill,
coming from camp to play a small
part, brought in a breath of military curt-
ness. Ivy Stacey and Nave were the
derelicts, and Ray Walsh, always an artist,
excelled himself as the gentle talkative
foreigner. The other players did just
good amateur work.
:!< sj:
Last week’s programme at Adelaide
Majestic came into the limelight through
the action of the Fuller management in
advertising in the Register the con-
trasted comments of that paper, which
was pleasantly complimentary, and of the
Advertiser, which slated almost every-
thing. The curious thing is that there is
hardly a sentence in either notice which
can be absolutely contradicted. But the
Register set out to be nice and the
Advertiser set out to be nasty; and if
the management implies that the Adver-
tiser was nasty because it has been shut
out from theatrical advertising, the public
has an equal gght to say that the
Register is nice because it isn't shut out.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The author of “The Belle of New York”
died in England a few weeks ago. He per-
petrated the libretto under the disguise of
“Hugh Morton,” because he was frankly
ashamed of it. His real name was Charles
McLellan, and as such he wrote “Leah
Ivlesehna” and many another attempt at a
real play. But the despised “Belle” was the
money-maker.
A mummer by the name of Byde, who
passed out in England recently, was said to
be the sole survivor of the London, in which
G. V. Brooke went down. He was a cabin-
boy at the time.
“Kaniva”: Henri Kowalski, the pianist,
died lately in Paris, aged 75. His first
Australian appearance was in September,
1880, at Melbourne Opera House, where he
made us all sit up and at his bril-
liance. He was a most prolific composer,
his “March Margroise” in particular having
an enormous sale. Kowalski eventually
settled in Sydney, where he became conduc-
tor of the Philharmonic Society. Before
touring he had been pianist to the third
Napoleon.
Died in London, on November 5, J. M.
Stevens, musical composer, of Sydney, a
native of the city, born in Upper Fort-street,
in the house in which G. It. Dibbs was also
born. Stevens and his family left Aus-
tralia some three years ago to enable his
daughter Cecile, a violinist, to take advan-
tage of a scholarship at the Royal Academy
of Music. The family consisted of seven
daughters and two sons, making with the
parents an Australian Eleven. " The elder
son is in the British air service.
“Seciriteur”: I’m afraid “Masetto” (B.
12/10/T6) is in error when he places the
first production of “Mignon” at the
Princess’s, Melbourne, in 1882. The opera
was first produced by Montague-Turner,
with the divine Annis in the title-role,' at
Brisbane. I happened to be the co.’s agent
at the time. It was the first appearance of
the lady in tights and high boots, and she
didn’t like it a bit.
“Stargazer”: Atholwood is gratefully
applauded in Melbourne, and is unquestion-
ably the best Jaikes. Probably 50 com-
ments on the _ quaint conditions of art here
that leave this artist out of the company
of the accepted stars have been printed dur-
ing the last few years; and still Atholwood
remains subordinate, almost invariably to
actors of far less worth. The inability of
the Australian playwriter to get a drama in
edgeways (I refer to serious Australian
tells on the Australian actor.
I know of several seemingly excellent plays,
written by literary friends, each of which
has a character for Jimmy Atholwood. Man-
agers here speak of him merely as
“a useful man.” I have known them do
this while starring useless “artists.”
“Norbell”: I had always supposed that
the late W. Shakspeare was stretching it a
bit when he made the attacking forces ad-
vance on Macbeth’s castle carrying leafy
branches to mask themselves with, and men-
tioned that they looked like a “moving
grove.” The other day I saw the thing actu-
ally happen at Enoggera camp (Q.). About
150 soldiers had been out gathering boughs
to roof over their mess-tables, and as
this khaki fatigue party came marching in,
each man carrying a big leafy bough, the
illusion of Birnam Wood on the move was
complete. He knew a lot, did Bill.
“Jwosp”: Sybil Arundale’s part in the
“Tiger’s Cub” was not her first appearance
in drama. In 1891 she played in Vezin’s
“Claimants.” Pantomime followed ; then, in
1898, she was Oberon in “Midsummer Night’s
Dream” at Edinburgh and Glasgow. Right
name, Kelly.

PLAYING HIS PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The actor heaved a windy sigh;
His luck was at its worst.
He had a retrospective eye,
He also had a thirst,
And as he leaned he tried to think
How long ’twas since he held a drink.
Then came a spry recruiting bloke,
And clapped him on the spine.
Said he: “I guess you’re stony broke—
Well, Henry, you are mine.
Come, don the khaki, neat and new—
Your bloomin’ country’s callin’ you.”
“Nay,” said the pro. with solemn phiz,
“I crave to go, I swear,
But Austral’s loss already is
Almost too great to bear,
And while 1 live at any rate
She is not quite disconsolate.
“For some must smooth Australia’s way
Or sadly will she sup,
And so it is for me to stay
And keep her spirits up.
But could you let me have a bob
Till such time as 1 get a job ?”

SOCIETY
“Norbell”: The second lieutenant was a
man with initiative, so when he could find
no N.C.O. to parade the “crimes,” he
grabbed Private Blinkey and hurriedly
pinned a couple of chevrons on his right
sleeve. “Parade these two men to Head-
quarters,” he commanded, “an’ for Gorsake,
Blinkey, remember you’re a corporal!”
Blinkey got his brace of “birds” in front of
the O.C. all right, but the big chief took
no notice of them —he had eyes only for
THE BRUTE.
“Did he break off the engagement?”
“Worse! He never made it!”
the Keystone corporal in charge, who com-
mitted every known and unknown military
solecism. At last the great man boiled over,
“Dammit man!” he barked, “you call your-
self a non-com., but vou don’t know enough
t, escort a iew lizard! You’re grossly in-
competent, sir; I reduce you to the ranks!”
Blinkey saluted and retired in disorder. Out-
side he met his anxious sub. “Well, how
did vou °et on?” “Get on?” repeated the
demoralised Blinkey. “ ’Struth, it’s lucky I
had them two stripes on, or I’d ha’ got
‘birdcage’' As it is, I’m only reduced to
the ranks '”
Governor Stanley was on good ground
when, the other day, he expressed surprise
at the neglect of the average bush-settler to
make himself a vegetable garden. Of course
the maintenance of such a plot isn’t the
simple little matter which the seedsman s
catalogue makes it out to be. But many
quite prosperous farmers never get beyond
the stage where the pepper-tree is the oaly
cultivated vegetable. Cocky is usually ener-
getic enough in the matter of planting grub
for his stock, but mostly he gets that pain-
fully tired feeling when it comes to prepar-
ing a small piece of ground and looking for-
ward to the time when he will be able to
provide carrots, parsnips and suitable green-
stuff for his own family. It’s often much
better to be a cocky’s poddy-calf than his
daughter. #
“Billy B.” : Over in Maoriland the other
day I got up against the anti-shouting law.
Four of us breasted the bar, and Whosit
placed two bob under the pearl-rice nose of
Hebe. With the graciousness of her family
she, in return, placed four lovely long-
sleevers under our several corn-beefs. Then
John Hop arrove. Said he to Whosit: “you
paid for these drinks, didn’t you?” “I did,’
said Whosit, “and,' what’s more, I’m going
to drink them.” And he did, to the accom-
paniment of three cheers from the gang.
(P.S. —J.H. wasn’t one of the gang.)
“Stirrup”: In one batch Antill’s Brigade
got 522 prisoners, including Turkish officers,
besides two Germans and six machine guns.
This was at Hamishah. The Turks were glad
to get it over, and when the General jovi-
ally expressed his willingness to let them
go and have another fight to-morrow, they
raised great objections and said: “If it is
the will of Allah I suppose we will have
to fight; but we would sooner stop with
you.” On the occasion of their capture
the Turkish machine-gunners put up their
hands to surrender, but the German who
was in charge of the show turned the gun
on them and wiped most of them out and
ran the gun himself for a while. Then he
tried to get away on a camel, but we cap-
tured him. He was a fine-looking man
who wore the Iron Cross, and refused to
be associated with the Turkish prisoners,
upon whom he looked with apparent disdain
and disgust. He is now in the Cage at
Cairo. The General was up in Cairo after-
wards and got permission to entertain the
Turkish general. But I never heard of
anyone begging for the privilege of enter-
taining the German.
The crazy citizen has
been getting more fre-
quent in Victoria. La,st
year’s figures, just is-
sued by Inspector-Gen-
eral Jones, show that
the proportion of in-
sane is greater than it
has been at any previ-
ous time. Of the 824
cases admitted to asy-
lums during the year,
venereal disease is
alleged to be respon-
sible for 70. But gen-
eral paralysis sent in
68 and “hereditary in-
fluence” 140, while 82
were congenital defec-
tives ; and most of all
these are the victims
of the insidious ven-
ereal trouble. The 5767
registered insane in
Victoria are almost exactly half males
and half females, so the weakness of
the yveaker sex is evidently elsewhere
than in the head, all apparent evi-
dence to the contrary being plainly
unreliable. The most cheerful part
of Dr. Jones’s report is that relating
to the effect of military service. The
number of patients so far received
from the Front is “much less than
one would have expected,” which is
another tribute to the stamina of the
best-class Australian. On the other
hand, it seems likely that the war
has been responsible for the general
increase in mental maladies, which
is exactly as one would , have ex-
pected.
“Inchiquin”: Even in hospital you don’t
escape the army system. Your bed, whether
you are in it or up, has to be made in the
regulation fashion, with the clothes turned
back at a cer t a in spot—a spot that leaves
shoulders ouite uncovered The cots
your shoulders quite uncovered. mt
have to dress as though they weie
a section of men on parade. When you are
in bed your hospital clothes have to be
folded in regulation fashion ; around your
clothes your tie (which unfolded resembles
a large red handkerchief) has to be bound in
regulation fashion, and the whole has to be
packed in your little deal locker just as all
the other good little boys do it. Out wives
won’t know us when we get back; we ve
forgotten how to be untidy.
On the night before the Cup a speech by
the British Prime Minister was cabled to
Australia. According to the long wet wire
Asquith had said “the suggestion that we
should build up an impenetrable barnei
against German trade after the war is a
childish fiction. It would be economic sui-
cide.” None of the men in the newspaper
EUCHRE.
P RIEST: “Now, Bat, ye’re very behind with
your garden. There’s nothing show-
ing.”
PAT : “Sure, Father, the slugs and such
bastes were so troublesome last year
that I thought I’d put the spoite on
thim and not grow anything at all.”
offices smelt the nigger and the statement
was published as received. The S. M.
Herald went black in the face about it and
printed the sentence in large type at the
top of the column. Melbourne newspaper
men rushed to hear what Hughes had to say,
and he performed beautifully. Several hours
later, just in time to save the evening papers,
another cable flickered along. It read: “In-
stead of ‘barrier against German trade,’
read ‘barrier against neutral trade.’ ” Gran’-
ma Herald will look under the bed next
time before she shrieks for help. So will
Hughes.
• At Hornsby (N.S.W.), before an Exemp-
tion Tribunal, an applicant for a clearance
gave the following reasons: (1) Dyspepsia,
(2) nerve affliction, (3) neuritis, 14) beard
falling out, (5) hay fever, (6) bronchitis,
(7) asthma. Probably the fourth plea would
have secured exemption, for no man whose
whiskers are liable to blow away should be
allowed in the firing-line where a handful
of them might happen into Billjim’s eye just
when that celebrity had a bead on a child-
murdering Hun. Nor should he be allowed
to work in the cooking lines, because face
herbage in the General’s soup might throw
him into a state of mind which would cause
him to lose a whole battle. However, as the
applicant was an only son, the other grounds
were waived.
A Melbourne sport had to do a lot of
climbing one recent evening to get on the
other side of' the new Early Drought law.
He gave a little supper at the Savoy on Cup
Night and had a few bottles of something
bubbly ready for them. But the police beat
him by raiding the place and impounding
the liquor. His next move was to take a
taxi to his flat and bring down a supply.
Then the supper went on as usual except
that between courses the party adjourned to
the taxi outside for a drink.
“Bombs” : Talk about chancing it. On
Gallipoli we used to shake the bombs from
the trenches and blow up fish with them on
the beach. In this way a pleasant change of
diet was obtained. Here, in a sector that
was very quiet nfter Pozieres, one of our
Billjims was caught sneaking along a hedge,
ordinarily in full sight of Fritz, with a bomb
in each hand trying to stalk a pheasant.
The only' cover he had from a whiz-bang
or a sniper was a foggy morning.
“No. 4” : It was just after Pozieres, and
the sorely-wounded Billjim was being ques-
tioned by an orderly of an advanced dress-
ing-station :
Orderly: “Name, number, age, service?”
Billjim: “Jones, 13, 27, two years.”
Orderly: “Religion?”
Billjim: “Horsebreaker.”
“Roz”: This is an-
other of the many
“histories” of “the
Malakoff,” mentioned
bv “Copabella” (B.
9/11/T6). The castle
was built in ’46 by an
early Victorian called
Raleigh, who carried on
the boiling-down works
on the bank of the
Maribyrnong (then
Saltwater) River. It
was originally intended
as a hash tower for his
employees, who on occa-
sions took refuge there
from the blacks. It
also served as a land-
mark for shepherds,
being visible from be-
yond Keilor, and as a
iookout from which the
flocks could be seen
hours before their arri-
val. Hence the com-
mon name, “Shepherd’s
Lookout.” Re 1 i gious
services were held with-
in it at intervals. On
one occasion the place
was taken possession of
by a gang of bushrang-
ers, one of whom was
killed and buried near
the castle. In the ’6o’s
the Melbourne Meat
Preserving Co. took
over the works from
Raleigh and employed a
large number of men. A
liquor license was ob-
tained, but a couple of
years later this charter
was transfered to Spong’s Maribyrnong
Hotel.
w * * *
“Elburg”: Some of the pleas for exemp-
tion from service in W.A. make humorous
reading. About the most far-fetched claim
to be doing work of national importance was
that put forward on behalf of a usurer’s
hireling. Shentpershent uttered a pathetic
bleat to sa his underling from the horrors
of stew and drill at Blackboy Hill; but the
P.M. could not be persuaded that the
Empiah demanded that Ikey junior should
HIS BIT.
SOLDIRE (to dosser): “Wadder you know
abaht war anyways? Yous ain’t done
no blindin’ fightin’!”
DOSSER: “Oh, hain’t I? Why, I wuz one
of the original British ‘tanks’!”
remain in his den to wrestle with com-
pound interest. Another heartrending ap-
peal was made by the sisters of an R.C.
reformatory washery. The good ladies urged
that the male person who took hoine the
rejuvenated lingerie did it so capably and was
so honest in the matter of small change that
the mere thought of losing him affected them
like a tear shell. Again authority declined
to be moved, believing that the transport of
the soiled and clean collar would have no
material effect in foiling Von Hindenburg.

Harry took his Hilda rowing
Down the chuckling bay.
Through the waters of Flirtation
Skilfully they rowed,
While the shallows of Temptation
At a distance flowed.
Light they lunched on wine and apples,
Drifting went the oars,
Where the shadows danced in dapples
Down the flowery shores.
Came the lilting lark of Laughter,
Sang them into land ;
And Contentment followed after
Up the creamy sand.
Through the groves of Hope they wandered
To a mossy bank ;
Love amongst the blossoms pondered,
And their promise drank.
Sunset stooped with passion ladeh
Whispering to the sea:

Kissing Destiny.”

J. GERMAN, ■i n * mcer » Ocean House, Moore St., Sydney
This, from Pearce’s dominion, is one of
numerous letters The Bulletin has re-
ceived on the subject:—
What is one to do in a ease like this? My
brother went with the first contingent, has been
through most of the fighting, and is, or was, on
August 26, T6, in England in hospital. Whilst
still in Egypt (June, 1916), before leaving for
France, he was made sergeant, and then increased
his allowance to me; and although I have written
the paymaster I can get no satisfaction. My bro-
ther intended me to use the extra money to pay
someone to help during the busy season on the
farm, and considering that there are only myself
and father, aged 80, the help is badly needed. Isn’t
six months long enough for the Department to know
something of this matter?
The writer, by the way, is the sister of the
soldier. In another case, it is more than six
months since the promotion. The Defence
Department has some curious ideas about
the right way to stimulate recruiting.
* * * *
“G. Elb”: Sizing up the various Aus-
tralasian contingents which pass through
Perth on their way to the Front it is easy
to pick out the Maorilanders without look-
ing at their uniforms. Massey’s warriors
are a type quite distinct from Australians,
resembling the stolid and solid well-fed Eng-
lishman. The Maorilander, moreover, is
not so addicted to beer and blanky as his
Australian cousin. He has struck Perth as
a remarkably well-behaved foreign tourist
who prefers to examine the city’s pub archi-
tecture from the outside. Bill of the Com-
monwealth shows more quick intelligence;
and I’m not surprised to get from a return-
ing-wounded Maoriland officer this dictum:
“For an attack with bayonet and bomb I’d
take the Australian before anybody else in
the world. For a patient defence I’d
take either our own men or the trained
Tommy.”

Melbourne is finding out how to econo-
mise. In the course of its scheme for dupli-
cating the suburban lines the Railway De-
partment recently built at Auburn a long,
high symmetrical rampart of soil removed
to make way for a track; then when the
navvies had acquired a good working know-
ledge of parapet building their bosses
ordered them to cart the whole lot back and
spread it. They have now advanced a step,
IT'S AN ILL WIND, Etc.
HE: “If this coal strike continues the city
will he in complete darkness."
SHE: “Oh, wouldn't that he lovely!”
and at Camberwell have erected a cemented
brick rampart, 100 ft. long, 15ft. high and
3ft. thick, with solid masses of bluestone
pitchers set in concrete behind it. This
was intended to keep the high bank from
falling on the station. Now engineers are
blowing the masonry to pieces with the in-
tention of erecting it Bft. further back. Cer-
tain evil-minded pro-Germans aver that the
Department had to shift the new station
that distance to the rear because it forgot
to leave room for the trains; but no atten-
tion should be paid to such rumors. The
Department knows what it is doing.
John McNamara, a citizen of Victoria,
has a fair reason for having a poor opinion
of the Law. He was charged with receiving
stolen goods, found guilty and sentenced to
12 months. But being a better lawyer than
SPOILS OF WAR.
LIEUTENANT LON G: “I captured forty-seven Germans during that one afternoon.”
MISS GREEN (brightly) : “Dear me! And are you allowed to keep all you catch?"
the Judge who tried him, John appealed
on the ground that evidence had been im-
properly admitted, and the appeal suc-
ceeded. Then he was tried again, and this
time the jury disagreed. Once more the
Law came at him; and this time, John
being found guilty, Judge Eagleson said
the offence was 50 per cent, worse than his
Honor at the first trial had thought it. If
the first Judge hadn’t strayed, or if having
strayed the prisoner had taken no notice
of it, John would now be serving 12 months.
He really gets an extra six months for pre-
suming to say that a Judge was wrong when
he was wrong. It doesn’t seem a fair deal,
somehow.

“Jib”: As one result of the coal strike
there has been a sudden revival of the
trade in firewood. Some years ago a small
fleet of ketches was engaged in bringing the
fuel to Sydney, but the day has passed
when there was good enough return for the
risk and labor. Some of the small craft,
making a desperate struggle of it, carried
no more than one man until, at last, when
one boat failed to return and another turned
up without her crew, the • authorities in-
sisted on a second hand being carried. Dodg-
ing along off shore the small fry were the
bane of the watchkeeping officers of the
steamers hustling along between Sydney and
Newcastle, as they were hard to see until
you were almost on top of them. Now the
busy ferry traffic does the cursing at the
firewood-laden ketch beating up Port Jack-
son with a lazy forefoot.

The Vic. Arts and Crafts Society doesn’t
see why Baby Australia shouldn’t have a
few toys of his own, and part of its recent
show was a local version of the old-fashioned
Noah’s Ark, inhabited by an aboriginal
Adam and Eve, with kangaroos, emus and
the rest of our own menagerie marching
two by two.
In 1848, when the “Young Ireland” rising
took place, Thomas Francis Meagher, of
Waterford, was taken as a rebel, and sent
as a convict to Van Diemen’s Land. He
married, and one of the tribe, an officer in
an Irish Brigade, now w T rites from thfe
Front: —
The thing that has struck me most is the mar-
vellous endurance of our infantry. They have a
rotten time of it —shelled, bombed, provided with
every source of discomfort possible—but they are
up and about when the flag drops, and march out
with pipes, drums and bagpipes, playing “God Save
Ireland,” “Gome Back to Erin,” “Tipperary”;
clothes mud from head to foot and torn to ribbons,
and they don’t worry one jot. Some time I was
camped next to a lot of your Australians. Fine
lads! The casualty list in my own little crowd has
been light, both in men and animals. Three Military
Medals have been awarded to men of my unit, a
fourth is going through, and one of my officers who
was taken' from me got the Military Cross.
“ Vagabond”: My business took me
through Pozieres soon after it had changed
owners. I’ve written descriptions of other
villages I’ve known that had been severely
strafed by shell-fire, but all are utterly out
of date now. Pozieres, Martinpuich. Cour-
cellette are several degrees worse
even than Fricourt and the other
places taken in the first attack of
July 1. For total smash I think
Pozieres comes first, with Martin-
puich running close. In Martin-
puich there is almost half a house
and several half walls, two or three
big unwrecked dugouts and one
whole roof—the two-foot-thick
curved-concrete cover to a bomb-
store. But Pozieres is just one
vast jumble of shell-holes with
splintered beams and rafters stick-
ing up out of the mess. The vil-
lage has disappeared. There aren’t
even rubbish heaps of brick and
mortar; there isn’t a trace of a
street or of the main first-class
Route Rationale road which ran
through it. Only in some of the
sides of the shell craters one sees
the whitish-grey of road metal.
Over the whole area of the late-
departed village and for some hun-
dreds of yards around, the shell-
holes are so close that there isn’t
a spot of ground where you can’t
stand with the right foot in one
crater and the left in another. The
place is exactly like a short, choppy
sea or an ugly tide-rip converted
into brown earth. A French writer
recently expressed admiration of
the British advance, and joyfully
chortled over the “44 French vil-
lages freed.” “Freed!” The tra-
gedy of it! What I’m waiting to
see now is whether total destruc-
tion can go further. I don’t see how it can
unless it leaves the village represented by a
bottomless hole and a name on the map.
* * * *
“Foe”: It was the tail-end of a big con-
signment of meat, and there was still four
hours’ inloading work for the gang when
the Saturday knock-off whistle blew. “Hold
on, boys!” called out one of the shippers.
The chaps stopped and looked up at him as
he stood on the gangway. “Look, lads, this
stuff will go soft if it’s left in tp£ trucks
over Sunday, so we’ve made a pool and
there’s about eight bob an hour for each of
you. Call it 32 bob a man for the after-
noon. What do you say?” A minute’s
hurried consultation amongst them and they
were scattering for their coats. “ yer
money! No good to us!” they said. And
the food was allowed to go to waste. It’s
no use saying that we take this war seri-
ously. We don’t.
Kathleen Ussher, a Sydney girl, tells how
she does her bit:—
I think I told you I had joined the Women’s
Reserve Ambulance, which is attached to the police
for service in Zeppelin raids. This week-end I went
on duty at the garage at eight. At 10 a raid was
reported; at 11.30 we were telephoned for. We
went out with the ambulance and three cars, but no
bombs were dropped in our area. At 1.12 a.m. we
saw the Zeppelin fall and stood by till 3 a.m. ; then
returned to the garage and slept till seven, when I
made for home.
After breakfast and change I went off to a muni-
tion works, where we made shells from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. This job is not in connection with the
corps. The Sunday staff are all people otherwise
occupied during the week, and you can imagine we
are a motley crew. By 5 p.m. the powdered lady-
on my right says: “I have no driving power left
in my arm.” “No,” I say, “I have only the will
power”—but it lasted the day. The powdered lady
has a Spanish maid who had disparaged her mis-
tress’s patriotism. “The ladies get very dirty,” says
she, “but they do not do much work.” So last Sun-
day the powdered lady brought Antonia down. “Ah,
senora,” wailed Antonia, half-way through, “do
not do it.” But you get repaid for the dirt and
tiredness. It is a tremendous satisfaction to see
the stacks of shells growing as a result of one's
“bit.”
I know an Australian girl—Nurse Clapin (now
Greatrex; her husband is in Salonika) —who, to
let a man get off, has put in three months on the
land, where twice a day she milks 20 cows. She
derives the utmost comfort from the fact that the
morning’s milk goes to a local munition factory and
the afternoon’s milk makes chocolates for the
troops. She also has 15 pigs to look after, and the
farmer threatens to sell his cows when she talks of
leaving.”
* * * *
When Australia was asked if it would
stand by its men who were reeling between
its helplessness and the devastating Hun
it said “No!” That, and nothing more.
Thus the old adage is re-written —brevity is
the soul of quit!
* * * *
Times are hard at Brighton (Vic.),
same as everywhere else. So the local
authorities have decided to raise by one-half
the rents of the 6 x S beach-allotments upon
which the seaside-dweller stands his bath-
ing box. It isn’t quite clear on what
ground the Brighton Council bases its claim
for the extra money. Perhaps the holy city

fathers want to discourage mixed bathing;
perhaps they aim to make it more exclusive.
Or perhaps it costs more nowadays to re-
move the drowned dog and the ship’s
refuse from the water’s-edge. Still, anything
that tends to make the daily tub more ex-
pensive is a matter for regret—more parti-
cularly in such suburbs as fusty old Brigh-
ton, which is prone to shut itself up in the
front parlor behind closed windows and dwell
upon the mouldy memories of its old gentil-
ity, instead of getting out and going down
for a roll around in the waves. Indeed it
is only during the past few years that
Brighton has even permitted the use of
bathing-boxes upon its sacred beach.

Wilhelm’s Day is waning now, but he is
at least sure of a place in. the sunset.
Just dead John Kent adopted the habit
of going full steam ahead in England, where
he was born, and didn’t drop the good cus-
tom when he came to Sydney in 1563. He
was best known as an accountant—of late
senior in Kent, Brierley and Sully—but in
addition he helped to manage the affairs of
many big concerns, including the Dixson
Trust. Having a great deal of work to do
he of course had time to spare, and he occu-
pied it by continuing to take a large in-
terest in the Y.M.C.A. till he was 73.
Ages of some Australian authors: War-
correspondent C. W. E. Bean, 37; Randolph
Bedford, 48; E. J. Brady, 47; poet J. le Gay
Brereton, 45; novelist Alf Buchanan (editor
Brisbane Daily Mail), 42; T. B. Clegg,
novelist, 59; Edward Dyson, 51; “Bleeds”
Pitchett, 72; Jeannie Gunn (“We of the
Never Never”), 46; Prof. G. C. Henderson
(“Life of Sir George Grey”), 46 ; Fred Johns
(“Notable Australians”), 47; A. W. Jose
(“History of Australasia”), 53; Henry Law-
son, 49; C. R. Long (“Stories of Australian
Exploration”), 56 ; Prof. Mungo MacCallum
(“Studies in German Literature,” etc.), 62;
Prof. Gilbert Murray of Oxford (historian
and Greek translator), 50; Mrs. Campbell
Praed, 65; Ambrose Pratt ( biographer of
David Syme), 42; Prof. Ernest Scott (“Life
of Flinders”), 48; Prof. W. Baldwin Spencer
(“Native Tribes of Central Australia”), 56;
and Prof. T. G. Tucker (Greek works), 57.
“Joe” Syme has passed away, after a
lengthy illness. He was the son of Eben-
ezer, one of the two brothers who founded
the Melbourne Age. For many years Joe was
business-manager of the Age, and did his
work thoroughly. But he did not get on
very well with his dour uncle, and for a
long time they never spoke to one another,
all communications being made in writing.
Finally the tension became so great that
David said to Joe, “How much for your half-
share of the Age?” Joe asked for £250,000,
finally took £150,000 cash and walked out
into the land boom in 1891. He was an early
investor in Mount Lyell, and a useful mem-
ber of the board of directors. If he lost
any money in banks he must have recovered
it from his Lyell shares, which went from
15s. to £l3 10s. cum rights. He was a fine
type of business man, shrewd, cautious and
chockful of commonsense.
Billy, with his scratch Ministry, doomed
to wither at the first breath of summer;
C.E., defeated for the U.S. Presidency;
General Sam, relieved of the portfolio of
Defence in Canada —these must be the
Hugheses of adversity that Shakspeare men-
tioned.
Hannan, M.H.R. for Fawkuer, selected to
second Finlayson’s no-confidence' motion last
week, has used his right of speech more often
outside the Plouse than in it. Hannan the
Parliamentarian usually looms about as
large as a tomtit in a gum-tree ; Hannan the
Trades Hall Council official has played quite
an important part in shoving the Federal
Labor machine off the rails. His selection,
therefore, was a tribute from his fellow-
wreckers. Normally Hannan has a very
apologetic manner and is almost painfully
polite, partly owing to the fact that his chief
association with politics before standing for
Fawkner was as secretary to the Marine
Cooks’ Union.
SE NATOR FINDLAY
Brigadier-General Glasfurd, killed in
action lately, was a permanent officer of the
Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders. He
was sent out by the War Office in 1912 as
Director of Military Training at Head-
quarters (Melb.). When the roof blew off,
his regiment, then “somewhere in Prance,”
asked for him, but Australia wanted him,
and he went away with the First Division.
Dead in England, at 62, Bedford McNeill;
whose cable code is used all over the world.
He was a mining man.
The remarkable Price quintette has been
broken by the death of Owen Price from
wounds. Though only 26, he was a lieut.-
colonel and a battalion commander, and had
won the Military Cross at Gallipoli. Father,
How’ell Price, is an Anglican parson in a
Sydney suburb.
BAD STATE OF AFFAIRS.
H E: “Dreadful thing this coal strike, isn’t
it?”
SHE: “Awful! Do you know I missed two
sets of tennis to-day through the ferry
service being upset.”
A grave in Macedonia is the undeserved
reward of Lieut. Norman Lucas, soldier and
scientist, recently attached to the Royal
Irish Rifles. The fine young Australian,
who was born at South Yarra, had seen
service at Gallipoli, and was having a
second helping in the Servian campaign
when a Bulgar bullet knocked him out. Prior
to enlisting, Lucas was performing brilliantly
at Edinburgh University. In addition to
heading his year’s list in advanced chemistry
be secured one of the three Hope scholar-
ships, and just after getting his commission
was presented with a Carnegie research
scholarship. He was an M.A., B.Sc., and
only 23 years of age.
When the King pinned the D.S.O. on
Major Percy Black last month he honored
an officer whose advancement has been re-
markable. Black, who belongs to the 16th
Battalion (South-and-Westralia), was with
a machine-gun section in Gallipoli, where,
as lance-corporal, he won the D.C.M. for
exceptional grit at Gaba Tepe on May 2 and
3, 1915. When surrounded by Abdul, after
the Australian soldiers on his particular
gun had been killed or wounded, Black fired
all the available ammunition and ended by
rescuing the gun. His bravery in Prance
secured him the Croix Militaire, the D.S.O.
and his majority.
The most picturesque member of the new
Ma State Ministry is David Storey, big
hatter and bigger flag-flapper. He started
life as a hustling drummer for a Belfast
linen firm, and got orders, too; but no one
could read his fist. His boss asked him to
try with his left hand. David, with a fine
premonition of his present Cabinet rank, re-
plied : “All great men are bad writers.” His
boss: “That may be, but very many bad
writers will never be great men.” This
paper doesn’t know what happened next, but
presently David reached Sydney—that was
in the ’7o’s. By dint of push he gradually
acquired his present York-street business, as
well as a sizeable squattage in North
Queensland. Twenty-three years ago he
defeated Edmund Barton, now of the High
Court, for Randwick, and has not been
outed since. That was the occasion on which
“Toby,” bitter for once, said he had been
beaten by a man who. owned 10,000 hats
and not enough brains to decently stock one
of them. David is said to have been a
friend to needy politicians in Liberal circles
many a time. As there are really three
supernumerary Ministers in the team, and
he is the only “honorary,” it looks as if
somebody felt ashamed not to give him
something.
James Lamb, who worked on Ballarat
near the beginning of things, passed off the
other day, aged 80. Born in Glasgow he
left it as a lad and got to Victoria in 1852.
He put on the red shirt in 1853 and later
on was a working partner in the Kohinoor
and Band of Hope shows. Then he fell
from grace and became a stockbroker.
Walker Lane, of Lane and Peters, who
finished Life’s contract last week in Sydney
at 63, built his own monument, and it’s a
good one—Cataract Da'm, the giant wall
that stands between two rocky hills and
pushes against Sydney’s longest drink.
Westralia has lost another mining pioneer
in Herb Gaston, part-owner of the Nil Des-
perandum at Burtville. Twenty years ago
he was on Yilgarn, and subsequently rambled
over most of" the eastern W.A. goldfields.
The last of “The Terrible Ten” —a gang
of minor Sydney brigands with a suburban
reputation—was sent up for 12 months’
hard last week, the unheroic charge being
“receiving a number of fowls stolen from a
poulterer’s shop.” The other nine Terrors
being already in gaol on various charges, the
Terrible business is temporarily suspended
and the annual report and balance-sheet will
not be issued.
Sergeant Norman Galbraith, killed in
Prance, after having a look in at Gallipoli
with the boys from Victoria, was well known
in mining circles in Stawell. For many
years he was engaged with his brothers in
cyaniding ventures, in the days when pay-
able tailings propositions were more plenti-
ful than they are now. The Wimmera and
the Wonga heaps at Stawell, battery sand
at Moyston, and alluvial “slum” from the
Chinamen’s quicksilver cradles on the Hop-
kins were some of their ventures. Later on
he and his brothers were partners in the
plucky Wilkinson syndicate, which put up
a fine battle with the low-grade deposits on
the Big Hill, Stawell, thereby achieving a
good deal of fame and incidentally dropping
a good deal of cash when values fell below
6s. per ton. Later on the Galbraiths took
to farming, but Norman and a brother-in-
law, J. P. Doyle, formerly Director of the
Stawell School of Mines, went off to Gal-
lipoli. In the days when Stawell was one
of the largest mining centres of Australia
Peter Galbraith was one of the most enter-
prising men in the industry, and it was
common opinion that the mine he couldn’t
float was unfloatable. His sons certainly did
their best by the industry while there was a
crust to be made out of it.
W. NIMMO, of the Engineer-in-Chiefs
Department, Tasmania, who is at pre-
sent busy on the Derwent Bridge scheme.
Carlisle Studholme, of Waimate, S. Can-
terbury (M.L.), had a sudden death from
pneumonia during the Victorian racing
carnival. He was something of a horse-
owner, but was much better known in
southern Maoriland as the founder of the
Studholme Mounted Rifles. Most of his life
was spent chasing excitement. He was early
at the Coolgardie rush, and only got there
after he and a brother had lost their kit and
nearly their lives in a wreck en route. A
big-game tour to S. Africa engrossed his
energies for a while; and then he “did” the
Panama Exposition. Next he craved to go
to the war; but the doctors barred that defin-
itely. His father, Michael, the first white
man to see Waimate, owned but never bet
on some first-class horse-flesh.
How time and illness change a man!
Alfred Deakin arrived in London just when
the hand of his own Australia was tracing
“No” on the wall, and the pressmen went
down in hopes of getting something from
the ready orator of years ago. But—“ Mr.
Deakin declined to discuss the Referendum.”
Deakin silent in the London he charmed
years ago with his eloquence is one of the
minor touches of pathos in latter-day Aus-
tralian public life.
THE FUNERAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Fall in A, jail in B,
Fall in, ev’ry Company.”
We was ’avin our scran w’en the ’sembly brayed,
An’ we grumbled a curse or two,
As we buckled an’ buttoned, an’ rushed on parade,
With our grub on’y ’arf-way thro’.
“Serrymonial Drill!” barked the W.O.
An’ a square-an’-all curse we gave,
For a funeral march we was booked to go,
To foller some bloke to ’is grave.
An’ we stepped it out to a ragtime strain,
As the band played a lively air,
An’ we all filed inter the waitin’ train,
An’ started for Gawd knows w’ere.
An’ we yarned an’ smoked, an’ was rushed to town,
W’ere we squeezed thro’ the peerin’ throng,
An’ the cold-footers screwed with a sneerin’ frown
At our push uv a ’undred strong.
An’ we come to the ’alt at a dingy shop
With a undertaker’s sign,
Near a likely pub, an’ a serious cop
Was keepin’ the crowd in line.
“Guard, pre-sent urns!” They lumbered it out
To the shabby old waitin’ ’earse,
Then, “Guard, slow march!” an’ we wheeled about
With arms at the bloomin’ reverse.
An’ the band in the lead, with th’ drums in black,
Was wailin’ th’ March in “Saul,”
An’ we come next, an’ away at the back
Was the ’earse, an’ the cause uv it all.
An’ slow we marched thro’ the city street,
With its muddle uv motor an’ tram,
Where the civvies an’ tarts was starin’ a treat,
An’ nobody cared a damn!
An’ miles we crawled down the dusty road,
Past many a temptin’ pub,
An’ rifle an’ web made a dinkum load
W’en we’d on’y ’ad arf our grub.
.At last we come to the boneyard gates,
W’ere the green trees meet above,
An’ there in ’is surplice the chaplain waits,
As meek as a suckin’ dove.
An’ we lines the track, with our ’eads bowed low
An’ our rifles upside down,
An’ the pilot leads the ’earse, dead slow,
Between our ranks uv brown.
Then we closes in an’ we toilers ’im,
With about two score uv kids,
An’ we crunches th’ gravelly path, so trim,
An’ th’ sex'ons lifts their lids.
Then, “Earth to earth,” an’ the kiddies squeeze
For a look-in, on either flank;
An’ we scared th’ sparrers from off th’ trees
W’en we fired our three rounds blank.
An’ the on’y mourners there was us—
An’ th’ sparrers, a khaki flock—
For some poor bloke ’oo ’ad missed th’ ’bus
An’ taken th’ bloomin’ knock.
An’ the Last Post echoed around th’ flat
With a mournful kinder sound,
Then we sprinted away at a lively bat,
Quick march from th’ buryin’ ground.
An’ th’ band struck up “Red, W’ite an’ Blue,”
An’ we sang, an’ th’ civvies stared;
But the name uv the corpse, there was none uv us
hneiv ;
An’ blanlcy few uv us cared!

NORMAN CAMPBELL.


HE nearness of Xmas is beginnin
1 to dawn upon the minds of men,
whose thoughts for many weeks past have been
wholly taken up with the turmoil of politics and
the referendum campaign.
Between now and the year-end-holiday
season there is but little time in which to prepare,
making it all the more imperative that the needs of men in the matter of
dress should have early if not immediate attention.
An “Austral” Sac Suit to Measure
should be ordered here, and now
to ensure its completion early, and to avoid all.risk
of disappointment, which may likely happen if ordering is left too late.

Westralia is not shouting itself many big
bottles. The war is stuffing profits into the
pockets of a good many people in Britain
and most of the Australian States; but
Westralia is getting little out of it except
the knowledge that the State is doing its
duty magnificently. Its big gold-mining in-
dustry is one of the few that are heavily
handicapped by the war. Gold is almost
the one product whose Value has not in-
creased. It can’t increase. It is the stan-
dard, the one fixture. But while the Wes-
tralian gold producer gets no more for his
produce, he has to pay more at almost every
turn. His costs have increased from 12 to
20 p.c. in three years. That and war taxa-
tion and the fatal habit which gold-mines
have of petering out have made a good part
of Westralia feel uncomfortable. Add to
that the succession of disappointments in the
agricultural areas, the call for either more
economy or more taxation or some of both
in State departments, and the natural depres-
sion in the timber trade owing to shortage
of freights. The gloom is too deep to be
altogether relieved by the gilt which high
prices have of late spread on the pastoral
industry.
So there has been a steady shrinkage in
profits from £36,488 as at September, 1912,
to £27,140 in the past half-year. Increase
of exes.—chiefly taxation—has of course
had much to do with this, but not all. Gross
profits have shrivelled, too. Here is a
small comparison :

That isn’t a reassuring table; and when
shareholders observe that the 20 p.c. divi-
dend absorbs all but a poor little £2140 of
the profit, they can’t feel very comfortable.
Of course, so far as most of them are con-
cerned, it isn’t a2O p.c. dividend at all. As
the first table shows, shares have been
issued at a heavy premium. The last lot
(£lO shares) were sold for £2B. and others
had been sold for more. The 20 p.c. divi-
dend is therefore equal to only 64 or 7 p.c.
on the bulk of the money invested in the
business; and it isn’t anything to give three
cheers about, taking the past glories and
possibilities of Westralia and the future
risks into account. Those risks, both min-
ing and agricultural, may be very well pro-
vided for. All doubtful assets may be
severely written down. The Bulletin cer-
tainly doesn’t know any State where securi-
ties are liable to a larger depreciation. This
is not to say that Westralia has no future,
of course. It is simply that old mining
fields are being rapidly exhausted, and wrong
distiicts have been selected for farm pur-
poses.

There isn’t any excuse for overlooking Kelso
King’s belltopper in Sydney; and none is
attempted. Perhaps it was the war ; perhaps
it was just plain carelessness. Anyway, even
at this late hour the belltopper is reverently
upended and the contents spilled in the fore-
going table. The Mercantile Mutual was a
very unprogressive concern once. It didn’t
have any use for anything but the' very
choicest risks, and it wouldn’t take any out-
side N. S. Wales. No doubt it had to go
slow, because its capital was very small;
still, that shouldn’t have been much of an
obstacle, because the co. has an unusually
affluent share-list. Things have, however,
steadily improved every way, the management
having come to the conclusion that 10 p.c.
profit on £150,000 of business is better than
20 p.c. on £50,000.
Unfortunately the eo. had got into the bad
habit of paying the shareholders a dividend
based not on the profit-yield of the busi-
ness, but on its volume: 20 p.c. of the pre-
miums were divided as a bonus between
policyholders and shareholders last century,
when, the premiums were under £40,000.
and the same very imprudent rule still
applies when the income is over £140.000.
The result has been to put too much in
shareholders’ pockets and leave too little
with the co. To some extent that was
atoned for by getting in a bit more share
capital a couple of years ago; but even
now the capital and reserves (including
contingency fund) are only 133 p.c. of the
year’s premiums, which are the only meas-
ure we have of the risks. Of course,
nobody doubts the strength of the co. Apart
from what it has in hand, the shareholders
—a very affluent lot. as already mentioned
—are liable for £125,000. Still, we like
these typical Australian cos. to show better
figures than the best of the foreigner’s ; and
at present the Mercantile Mutual doesn’t in
this one respect.

This was one of the mad flotations of the
last little company-floating boom in Sydney ;
and _ subsequent management has - done
nothing to improve matters. For instance,
Baumann’s was taken over two or three
years ago; and now it is announced that “a
substantial loss” has been made there, and
“in August last it was decided to close Bau-
mann’s except for social functions, and this
action will largely reduce the loss there.”
Further:—•
In view of the closing of the restaurant portion of
Baumann’s and the early expiry of the lease of 189
Pitt-street, it will be necessary to write dpwn the
expensive plant at these establishments.
When the co. was formed it paid £17,000 for
the goodwill of two businesses. One was in
premises whose lease expired within a few
months. The other was in premises at 189
Pitt-street, the lease of which is just about to
expire. Apparently it is not intended to seek
a renewal of this lease. Anyway, it is de-
clared that “as the lease of The Popular [lB9
Pitt-street j expires in September, 1917. the
heavy loss on this establishment will soon
cease.” If this isn’t cheap bluff, then the
whole of the original goodwill for which the
co. was induced to pay £17.000 is about to
disappear. The co. now owes £14.574. and
besides plant and goodwill it has these assets:
Freehold, £17.000; stocks. £5334; “payments
in advance” and sundries. £3490. The free-
hold is a bakery, etc., off doubtful value apart
from the business. In these circumstances
the shareholder who regards his interest as
having any substantial value is an optimist.

The little co. risks nobody’s money but its
own: its total liabilities are under £l2. In
the circumstances, big profit is out of the
question. But risks are doubtless small, too,
The co. is evidently lending with caution.
Two years ago outstanding loans were
£32,282; last year they were £11,121; this
year £10,600. That means comparatively
few new loans; and old loans, on which
many repayments have been made, don’t
usually bother a building society. If loans
shrink much further, though, the 5 p.c. will
be imperilled; and even 5 p.c. is a pretty
poor return. You could put up with it if
there was a chance of something brilliant in
the distance; but building society prospects
are distinctly not brilliant.

Perhaps it is the high cost of labor and
materials; maybe it is also a reduced out-
put of beer. Anyway, the working account
profit (that is, proceeds from sale of beer,
etc., less all manufacturing costs) was only
£997 last half-year as against £2455 in the
half-year just before the war. Things would
therefore look pretty sick if it hadn’t been
that rents have kept up just about where
they were. But as most of the eo.’s pro-
perties are pubs (it has put all its undivided
profit into pubs), and as pubs are now
under serious restrictions, there way be a
shrinkage in this revenue presently. Still,
the co. has such substantial reserves, dis-
closed and undisclosed, that the earnings
will have to be pretty small before the 10
p.c. div. is impossible. In addition to the
reserves shown in the table there is £5OOO
in a Building and Plant Fund ; and it isn’t
an ordinary depreciation reserve, because
depreciation is provided for otherwise.
Capital being £17.949, the net assets were
thus £39,964 on August 31; and these assets
would only have to earn as an average 44
p.c. to pay a 10 p.c. dividend on the capital".
It’s a nice, comfortable position to get into
—especially in view of present storms.

The speed with which this co. recovered
profits when the shipping position improved
a little shows what a fine connection it has
hung on to. This current term, perhaps, it
may exhibit the ill effects of the strike; but
on a run of years the results are all right.
Ten years ago, shortly after the co. had
bought a new property (having worked out
the old one), it owed £12.422 and had a
mine to develop. It has not only done that
job. but it has (1) of recent years paid good
dividends. (2) within the last few months
bought a new coal area adjoining the Bell-
bird and Aberdare. and (3) heaped up liquid
assets. This table shows part of the move-

It isn’t suggested that all the added liquid
assets are undivided profits. As the coal
is dug out and sold, the mine, which repre-
sents most of the capital, shrinks in value.
But it looks as though this time full provi-
sion is being made for the shrinkage, ana
that when all the coal is gone the co. Will
at least have the comfort of its original
capital. And meantime there is 10 p.c. to
go on with.

Considering the gjreat value of its pro-

its railway, this co. has given very disap-
pointing results of late, and the directors
are fortunate to have a complaisant lot of
shareholders, otherwise _ some sort of in-
quiry would have been insisted upon. Is or
is anything being put by in the way of
cash to repay the capital when the mines
are worked out. Here is a 10 years’ com-

Thus whereas floating assets have increased
by £56,805 in the 10 years, liabilities (mostly
mortgage debentures) have increased by
£70,110. This paper doesn’t for a moment
suggest that the co. has been going back-
ward and paying out more profit than it
has made. On the contrary, large amounts
of surplus profit have unquestionably been
put into plant, coal property and railway
and other improvements. But that isn’t
much satisfaction to shareholders if, after
all, they can’t get more than 5 or 6 p.c.
Still, it is reasonable to hope that things
will improve by and bye. Conditions in the
coal business are certainly not normal. They
rarely are.

But whether there was a gross profit of

of that and a bit more can’t really be told
yet. The net loss of £3169 shown “has been
arrived at.” the directors say, “by taking

to be made. The mine wants either a new
general manager or a new Board. The
Board (apparently by majority) “regrets
that it cannot endorse the general mana-
ger’s claim that the metallurgical results
obtained from the treatment plant far ex-
ceeded expectations.” Estimates and actual
results, the Board say, compare this way:-
Lead. Silver. Zinc.
Estimate .. 58.0 p.c. 35.00 z. 45 p.c.
Actual.. .. 55.7 p.c. 47.40 z. 42.6 p.c.
The lead and silver are, of course, in one
concentrate and the zinc in another. On
paper the co. lias a surplus of £111.253 of
“floating assets,” but this includes £72,403
paid for slimes, and so far slimes haven't
returned the shareholders anything in the
way of a dividend.

pay more than expenses out of what they
despised in the days of their great expecta-
tions. Ten years ago it was said that 5600
tons of carbonates remained in Block
14, and could be profitably extracted. The
co. has been breaking carbonate ore ever
since, and last half-year gouged out 4335
tons. Moreover, “the stopes continue to
yield a steady supply, and there is no reason
to anticipate any sudden falling off in deliv-
eries, although nothing in the way of a
definite estimate of ore in reserve can be
given.’’ Costs are high, naturally : it is a
question of poking about to find new patches
and sometimes going into old ground. Last
half-year costs —mining alone —were £2 7s.
3.1 d. per ton. whereas costs of mining
and milling at, say, the South are some-
where about 21s. But the South turns out
130,000 tons or so per half-year, and can
see 12 or 13 years’ work ahead at that rate.
Besides the very uncertain carbonates,
which the smelters snap up greedily, Block
14 has perhaps a couple of hundred thou-
sand tons of sulphides, and an agreement
has been made with Block 10 to take and
treat 1000 tons a week. “The treatment
will embrace flotation as well as ordinary
concentration methods, and the additions to
plant, necessary before delivery can com-
mence, should be completed before our next
general meeting’’—presumably sometime in
May. Block 14’s profit last half was
£6279, after providing for depreciation; and
besides paying the usual div. at the rate
of 10 p.c. on pref. shares, all.shares (pref.
and ordinaries alike) got 6d. per share. A
juicy thing those prefs. have been, by the
way. They were issued when the co. was
very hard up-—lOO,OOO at 6s. They get 10
p.c. interest, and have for years also drawn
Is. a year ; and they are protected, so far as
principal is concerned, by £62,144 of sur-
plus assets, practically all cash and Com-
monwealth War Loan.
* * # *
8., M. & Co. (which no doubt means
lviug and Hylton) have made their report
on the Junction North. They did not meas-
ure the ore reserves, but took general-
manager Palmer’s estimate of 215,000 tons,
as well as his figures of slimes purchased
and imtreated (235,795 tons). Taking lead
at £25 and silver at 2s. they think the pre-
sent plant, with an expenditure of £5OOO,
could make_ a profit of £726 a week from
slimes and £144 from the mine product, or a
total of £S7O, “out of which provision would
have to be made for plant depreciation.”
The slimes would be treated at the rate of
1800 tons a week and the mine output at the
rate of 1000 tons a week. Assuming that
the slime plant could be kept in operation
from mine product till the lead mill had
completed its job, the profit would total
£187,050. But the slime plant, treating
1800 tons a week, would no doubt run out
of feed first. The 215,000 tons of ore would
alone yield a profit, on 8., M. & Co.’s esti-
mate, of £30,960, while, say, 260,000 tons of
slimes at the expected profit of Bs. per ton
would give £104,000. These figures, it must
be repeated, are built on lead bringing £25
and silver 25.; and no allowance is made for
any slime that may produce a smaller profit
through being oxidised. Also, lest any share-
holder should fancy he has the money in his
pocket, it is just as well to remember that
Junction North has hitherto been full of
disappointments.

From London: F. A. Govett has just
issued another circular replying to the agi-
tation for an investigation into the affairs
of the Zinc Corporation. Govett says that
by working on the tailings redemption fund,
and, if necessary, by realising on invest-
ments, the Board will be able to meet any
further requirements of capital for the
Associated Smelters and the Tasmanian
Zinc Corporation without any increase of
capital. He adds that large profits are
being earned, and for the current year ordi-
nary divs. will be paid. The two Hoovers
are still managing-directors; and despite a
report circulated here six months ago that
8., M. & Co. had been passed out, that firm
still acts as general managers.

Edna May Battlers (W.A.) owes £2500
to the people next doo:, who made a quick
£5OOO by selling out when the Westonia boom
was on. As the co.’s cash in hand on Sep-
tember 30 was only £5OO, the battery will
have to speak up a bit, or there will be calls
ahead. So far the promised. 2oz. stuff hasn’t
materialised. Still, the battery has run on
loz. dirt, and with the dump carrying 6dwt.
this is a bit on the road. Everything depends
on what happens below water level, at 150 ft.,
where the co. has 300 ft. of a shoot to call on
for profits. Manager James has been pick-
ing up men in Bendigo, and the very latest
tip is another loz. yield.

Westralia is to have a conference early
next year to devise means for helping the
State’s mining industry. Mineowners,
miners’ unions, prospectors and “persons
interested” have been invited to attend and
offer suggestions. Meantime the gold pro-
duction steadily shrinks. This year’s total
will be about 150,0000 z. less than last year’s
and nearly three-quarters of a million
ounces short of what it was 10 years ago.

The whereabouts of a Melbourne syndi-
cate which recently took an option on the
old North Star mine at Malcolm (W.A ) is
sought. There was some talk of an expert
being sent along to report, but up to a
week ago he had not turned up, and fears
are entertained by the vendors that the
deal won’t come off. Years ago the North
Star was floated in London bv the late
G. W. Hall and was boomed for a while
Hard country and tapering shoots, how-
ever, soon caused that peerless optimist to
lose heart, and the show was abandoned.
Then the local pub and storekeepers took
a hand and have hung on ever since. But
neither they nor any others are ever likely
to make money out of it.
The Donnelly Rivet graphite deposits
(W.A.) have just been reported on by
Government geologist Woodward. Many un-
successful attempts have been made to market
these deposits since 1888, and another is now
in progress. Woodward says their value is
only prospective, but agrees that they are
worth further exploitation, which in his
opinion could best be done by boring.
Some Melbourne people have put up cap-
ital to prospect Mount Rankin, at Southern
Cross (W.A.), and about half a dozen
miners are now at work on the property.
But there is very little gold in the big hill,
and the outlook for the venturesome ones
who are providing the cash is gloomy.
* * * *
The announcement that Great Boulder
had abandoned its Magdala option at Sta-
Well (Vic.) did not cause any surprise. From
the start results obtained from development
in unwatered lower levels and bore holing
deeper down were poor; and never at any
time during the currency of the option did
prospects look very encouraging, and the
wonder is Great Boulder held on to it so
long.
Mararoa has taken the Bronco-Horseshoe
at Marvel Loch (W.A.) on approval, and
efforts are being made to raise capital to
work the neighboring Grand National group.
A few fair c-rushings have been taken out
of these shows, as out of a dozen other
mines on the field, which after further de-
velopment have proved to be duffers. In
the case of the Bronco and Grand National
results are not likely to be so attractive
as the predictions.
New Boddington (W.A.) has appointed
John Joice to be its manager. Joice has
had charge of a number of ventures in the
West, including the North White Feather
and Royal Standard, and was also at one
time underground manager at the Sons of
Gwalia.
* * * •
The yarn about the tribute-burrowed
North Kalgurli (W.A.) being absorbed by
a neighboring mine is being revived. Either
Oroya Links or Kalgurli, which work ad-
joining holdings, might make money and
prolong their lives a bit by acquiring the
show; but it would not be of much value
to companies operating further away on
the field. North Kalgurli shareholders were
informed at the last annual meeting that
their property was in the market and that
“no reasonable offer would be refused.”
* * * *
Dyason’s scheme to take over the control
of the best of Bendigo is being unfolded very
deliberately. The way is being prepared by
white-haired Stanfield. There will be a good
deal of opposition unless Dyason provides for
working conditions being complied with.
But much more than that should be seen
to. It will not be the thing if those who
mop up the loose shares should be able,
because of job-line purchases of forfeited
scrip, to dictate terms to men who have kept
the mines going. And there can be too much
amalgamation. A lot of the areas at Ben-
digo ought to be under one roof to save
surface costs and to get the best out of the
staff; but it is not necessary to do more than
group suitable blocks, and then there should
be the express condition that there must be
no shepherding, which has done more than
anything else to keep Bendigo back. So far,
labor seems to be indifferent about the
scheme. But it shouldn’t be. A word
snoken in season may stop a lot of fighting
presently.

There are whispers that something is
being done with the Altona brown coal-mine,
about eight miles from Melbourne. Lawyer
Croker has been sticking to the claim ever
since he set eyes on it, and now he seems
to have got another crowd to start out where
engineer Hoover left off. If the State Gov-
ernment should butt into brown coal at Mor-
well, some nice issues will arise. Legisla-
tors are not at all keen to let any private
mining co. get into the power business after
it has seen what the gas co. has done through
its monopoly. The State Industries Com-
mittee, too, is looking at the possibilities of
brown coaland sparks will fly if geologist
Herman leads it on to advocate nationalising
the brown-coal industry. There is good prece-
v.1 01 ' as the State of Saxony has
bought out nearly all the big German hold-
ers so as to take control of its lignite areas
* * * *
„ Ia the half-yearly report of Mount Bisehoff
Extended there is a graceful absence of allu-
sion to the financial side of the show. A
profit was made, and in these days of moder-
ate prices for tin that is something. Indeed
compared with the weary days of long ago]
tae C^^ qiute Prosperous now that it has
over £5OOO in cash, etc. Rightly, the Board
is holding on to this as long as it can, for it
has to tunnel 1400 ft. to get under the shoot
of ore at a vertical depth of 300 ft. below
the bottom level. The need for this big lift
is that the lode, though all right so far as
length goes, is narrow, rarely bulging out to
3tt. Just now Cyril Gudgeon, who runs the
mine, can measure up 28,000 tons of posi-
tive ore and 22,000 tons of possible above
and below the bottom level. Proved ore is
worth 1.05 p.c. tin. As last half-year’s work
gave an average of 0.946 p.c. for 8184 tons
treated, no fault can be found with the est-
imating. Costs at 20s. per ton look big along-
sme those of the Bisehoff next door, but it is
a different sort of mining altogether.
* * * *
South Aus., which considers that Provi-
dence treated it shabbily in not giving it
any first-class, mine of gold, silver or coal,
- reckons that it has come on a really good
opal-field in the Far North. Time will
show. . No mineral could be more. dis-
appointing, and no trade is more completely
in the hands of capricious foreign buyers,
mostly of —er —say Dutch nationality.
* * * *
“O’Phimerty”: About the saddest thing in
the mining business is the way it doesn’t
reward thrift. When a field has worn an air
of permanence for a few years the steadier
men have generally got their own house and
bit of garden. Then when the smash comes
they either have to abandon their home or
sell it for next tp nothing. On the Zeehan
field since the war upended the metal busi-
ness dozens of places that took many years
of screwing and scraping to pay for have
been sold for a tenner.
“Haka”: Seed is one of the worst nuis-
ances known in Maoriland wool, being ex-
tremely difficult to remove owing to the
fact that the stems are tough and lie parallel
with the fibre. A patent for dealing with
the afflicted fleece has recently been sub-
mitted by a local man named S. H. Knight
to the M.L. Trade Commissioner, with
samples of blankets made after the new pro-
cess had been applied. Knight is offering
the rights to the Government, so that all
growers may benefit. It looks a good thing,
and the cocky can already hear woolbuyers
hurling bids of 18d. for seedy fleece.
The Stormbird, oldest inhabitant on the
M.L. register of steamships, may yet steam
through the Dominion’s civil courts. Her
owners are said to be contemplating an
action against the Wanganui Harbor Board
to recover £7OOO as , compensation for the
loss of the old money-maker. When the
Ivaipara hit an uncharted rock in Auckland
Harbor several years ago the Harbor Board
had to pay for its carelessness in not cata-
loguing the obstacle. But the south mole at
Wanganui, where the Stormbird finished, is
as large and obvious as the public debt.

“J.C.” : The Maoriland bush produces an
A 1 fast black dye, from the hinau bark,
which has been used by the natives for
generations in making pigment for their flax
mats. Red and black — whero rna pango—
were the Maori artist’s stock colors. The
tattooing pigments, blue and blue-black, were
obtained by burning kahikatea (red pine)
and kauri in a kiln and collecting the soot,
which was mixed with oil. Still, what’s
the use of bothering about that? The war
will soon be over and then good old Fritz
will send us as much dye as we want.

“F.N.T.”: Sydney Stott, whose ancient
mastery of shorthand laid the foundation of
his later prosperity, has some original ideas.
One of them lately carried out was the im-
portation of an expert apple-packer from
the U.S.A. to show Victoria how to approach
the British market in the most captivating
manner. Tasmania lately hired Stott’s man,
who toured the apple orchards and taught
the islanders how to make the best showing
with their goods. Now he has offered the
expert to Victoria, suggesting that the Gov-
ernment should start classes in the fruit-
growing districts, charging a small fee. Stott
is himself an enthusiast who runs an orchard
at Dandenong Creek on up-to-the-minute
principles.

“Gwy”: Talk about cheap footwear! A
week or so ago, Maoriland traders were
looking at a sample infant’s shoe made for
export. The landed cost came to ss. or
ss. 6d. a dozen pairs —and it looked equal
to the sort of shoe for which a woman pays
half a crown or three bob. How was it
done? The sole was composed of a coating
of leather no thicker than parchment, the
rest being strawboard reinforced with string.
Rivets were used to join the sole to the
“upper,” which was of the thinnest sheep-
skin lined with canvas. A slight wetting
would turn the sole to pulp. If M.L. doesn’t
keep it out, what a time mother is going to
! have!

-“B.D.”: Black Brother could give points
sometimes to his successors. When he
wanted something to make his stone axe-
head stick good and fast to the handle lie
went into the bush and collected the gum
of the grass-tree (Xantliorrliea) , one of the
best things for the purpose in the world.
But when White Brother wants something
ot the kind he sends round the world and
buys stuff from Hamburg or Chicago, never
dreaming of looking out of his own back
door and keeping his money at home. A
V ic. co. is now making an effort to wake
people up and persuade them to use the
native article. The Japs know a thing or
two more than we do. Some time since they
imported a quantity of grass-tree gum anil
e\olved_ out of it an effective anti-fouling
composition for ships’ bottoms. Here, too,
the old-time Australians—white this time —
showed us the way. A Tasmanian news-
paper of 1826 reports that the 'master of a
loca l vessel had run her into Westernport
(yic.) and caulked her and painted her up
with grasstree gum.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 20, 1916.
My Dear Abini, —
The Government asked Poverty Point to
come along to afternoon tea and meet the
elephants and monkeys. A few stage lions
and lionesses responded. Thelma Raye’s red
locks flamed in the afternoon sun. Walter
Bentley exchanged compliments in Doric
with the tigers. Frances Ross, Eily
Malyon, and a few more heroes and
heroines climbed the broad white paths
that are dazzling tracks where once
leafy foliage shaded shy liill-paths. To
be candid, there’s been more axe than
discretion used in tfiis new paradise for
birds and beasts. And if many more trees
are chopped up for firewood the paradise
will be very hot in summer, and wretchedly
bleak in winter. As it is, the lion hasn’t
got used to his airy cave, and had a cold in
his head the other day. Still, he roared in
the most obliging fashion before turning his
back on the company. Premier Holman, who
is almost as thin as the tiger next door,
brought his lady to the party, which was
guided by director Le Soeuf and his smiling
young wife —she was pleasant Mary Greaves,
whose father was one of the early members
of the old Zoo council.
The gusts of Saturday morning made
College-street a windy funnel for the Eight-
hour procession. Most of the banners stood
the racket very well. But the Wharf Lab-
orers’ bunting, which was beginning to part
company with its moorings in Park-street,
was like a remnant at a bargain counter
when its ragged tail fluttered near the
Grammar School. The gorgeous emblems
of some of the Unions have improved out of
sight in recent years. Amongst the hand-
somest is that which waves before the
Seamen’s Union, a magnificent affair with
Britannia ruling the waves in the centre.
Some of the designs run to cherubs and
other symbolic figures. I notice they are
all fat. Union is strength and Fatness is
bliss. But Labor won’t get the Sassiety
matron to believe it.
Ostrich feathers such as we don’t often
see of late waved on the hats of many of
the ladies who drove along at the end of
the procession. The pity of it was to see
fluff worth two or three guineas torn from
its moorings and flapping in the wind, while
the white tendrils fell like snowflakes on
dad’s shoulders.
After the Albert Goossens sing-song in
the Conservatorium, an audience exhilarated
by the Belgian baritone’s brisk attention to
business compared its timepieces. Even
ladies’ watches, proverbially given to bolt-
ing, hadn’t quite reached 10 o’clock. No
boresome encores or futile efforts to drag
out the programme like an elastic string
had spoilt the pleasure. Goossens made
the best of rather thin material when he
sang two new ballads by Alfred Hill. They
lack the inspiration of the Maori melodies
and don’t grip. The Nile song by Leroux
and the massive aria from Dinorah got the
audience —or the foreign part of it—to its
feet with cries of “Bravo.” Pianist Yvonne
Charvan, in pensive mood, played the pre-
lude to Debussy’s “The Afternoon of a
Faun” full of delicate musical frills. W.
J. Coad had a sparkling interlude with his
fiddle.
Our good old friend Marie Narelle(now Mrs.
Currie, of U.S.A., and wealthy) has lately
been at a wedding—that of her son Reggie.
The young Australian married a charming
American girl. The' Narelle voice is said
by those who have heard it in late years
to have all the latest improvements and
additions without subtraction of its old
tenderness and charm. Her two daughters
Rita and Kathleen are suspected of inten-
tions to follow their brother’s example.
Another melomaniac, Kate Rooney, writes
from the same neutral country to say that
she will arrive in Sydney by the Yentura
about the end of this month on a visit to
her relatives. She brings her little Billy
with her (and let us hope some songs). The
dramatic contralto, describing her holiday
in a bungalow between a wood and a lake
(Lake Deal) in New Jersey, enthuses about
the beautiful wild flowers which just riot
in the woods. “What I marvel at,” she
writes, “is the indifference of the Americans
to their wild flowers —I suppose because
they cost nothing. The only flower over
which I have heard Americans enthuse is
che stiff American Beauty rose at a dollar
a rose. It is one ordinary bloom on the
top of about two yards of long, straight,
uninteresting green stalk. When admirers
send along American Beauties it is like
receiving a timbei--yard.”
The Colonial Medal of the Royal Acad-
emy of Music (address, London) this year
goes to Emily, the 13-year-old daughter of
the Alec Finns, of Parramatta. The local
convent is responsible for putting the young-
ster through 1 her musical paces, and the
award is in the shape of two years’ free
tuition at the academy in Blighty.
Muriel Buchanan, a pupil of Vost Jans-
sen, gives a concert in the Conservatorium
on December 11. There’s more than a pass-
ing interest in this youthful daughter of a
country schoolmaster. It’s the dogged spirit
of Young Australia hungering for Art and
battling for tuition against heavy odds. At
12 this youngster used to travel from Ten-
terfield to Sydney at frequent intervals to
scrape her fiddle under a master’s eye. Les-
sons by post filled the gaps. Now a deter-
mined mother keeps her in town to give the
girl a better chance as a member of Ver-
brugghen’s professional orchestra.
Former Australian music marin Katie
Christie died in U.S.A. the other day. She
went there years ago to the Stanford Leland
’Varsity. Her cabin-mates were Bessie Doyle
and Bessie’s fiddle.
The Women who plot a National organisa-
tion met in twilight gloom. The Town Hall
vestibule, which is usually ablaze with lights
from a gigantic chandelier —relic of days
when city fathers felt their way to the fatted
turtle by gas-light—was sombre at 3.30 p.m.
The conspirators bumped into each other
with purring apologies. “Is that you, dear
Mrs. So-and-so, and have you got a kerosene
stove? What, not a candle in the house?
Great Heavens —when will these
strikes! So sorry—did I hurt you?”
When the shuffling and squeezing through
the ci’owded gloom was becoming acute, the
laggard lights went up.
On the platform the best speakers were
Mrs. David, Marjorie Collison, Miss Scobie
and Gladys Marks, who has a fine polish on
her well-drilled periods. Mrs. Dillon, Mrs.
Bethel and Mrs. Burdett appealed to women
to stand by each other and unite as citizens
in helping their country in its hour of peril.
Mrs. David told party government some
very unpleasant truths about itself. “Yet,
years ago,” she said, “when I asked a man
if parties couldn’t be done away with and
country be the pivot, he said, ‘Oh, but we
have always had parties, so of course, we
can’t do without them.’ ” Then came the
usual prod from the chairwoman. Each
speaker was supposed to take exactly
six minutes to air her views. But
she usually ran over the mark. The
net result was the formation of a
provisional committee. Later on the male
legislator is going to get both the rounds of
the kitchen and the back answers of the
boudoir if he doesn’t mind what he is about.
Last week’s uncertain weather cleared up
on Saturday afternoon for the Andrews-
Gould wedding and the Eight Hour sports.
The wedding was attended with as much
splendor as the circumstances permitted.
Gladys had the Anglican archgaiters Wright
and Parson W. L. Langley to see that the
knot was nicely tied in All Saints’. I forget
how many guests were Asked, and how many
came along with suitable souvenirs. Local
society certainly did its duty, and the air
round barracky old All Saints’ reeked with
petrol for the rest of the afternoon. The
good-looking bride was given away by her
father, the Albert Gould who used to be a
Senator, and has big interests in mines and
banks and other troublesome things. The
’groom, Arthur Evelyn Andrews, is secretary
of the Australian Club, which added a silver
tea-service to the wedding presents.
Miss Cathie Mclnnes, of Inverary (S.A.),
is poised on the wing at the Australia. Pre-
sently she moves on to England to accept a
plain gold ring from Parson Frank Hutchin-
son. He is an F.R.G.S. and heir to a
Cumberland Baronet —the Hutchinson who
now reigns at Lor ton Hall.
Malcolm, eldest son of sportsman Matt.
Sawyer, of Bethungra, is in town. He came
to claim his best girl, Becky, the dark-eyed
daughter of James Connell, of Cootamundra.
Gladys Burcher, of Mosman, has made the
world seem pretty good, after all, for Stan-
ley Vere Toose, of the same suburb, who
serves as Associate to Judge-in-Divorce
Gordon. By way of a preliminary canter
the two played second-leads at sister Mabel’s
wedding at St. James’s last week.
With accompaniments of organ music a
daughter of the Charles Mitchells, of Dar-
ling Point, was linked up to a son—Leslie
Cyname—of the Moore Connells, of Double
Bayi This completes a trio of Mitchells
who have been united to a trinity of Con-
nells. The new pair will set up their house-
hold gods on the family acres out West.
Lieut. Clive Miller was married in Lon-
don a few weeks ago to Fanny Chubb,
a daughter of the man whose patent safes
are supposed to annoy the burglar. There
are ever so many of these insults to the
crowbar trade in the new Commonwealth
Bank, where young Miller’s father, Deni-
son, reigns. Both Clive and liis bride are
more than passing tall. Captain Jack
Playfair was second-best man. Mrs. Clive’s
wedding frock was a sensible, short white
satin affair, with a tulle veil as a frothy
overall. Commissioner Andy Fisher signed
the registry-book. I hear that making
patent safes is a much more lucrative 30b
than burgling them, wherefore the Chubbs
are disgustingly rich in spite of war taxes.
A daughter of solicitor Relph is engaged
to corporal Woodhouse, just back from the
Front. In normal times he’s in the Civil
Service at Suva —the place they ship the
Fiji bananas from.
A party of British subs, were unduly up-
lifted over a small raid in the desert. “We
buried 300 Arabs,” said one pink-cheeked
young cherub; “I wonder what the Austra-
lians did!” A Kangaroo chaplain looked
over the edge of his newspaper. “Killed
them,” he snapped, and returned to his
reading.
Purser Watt, of the Arabia, counted his
third wreck when the P. and O. liner was
torpedoed in the Mediterranean. First,
when the China tried to walk over the end
of Arabia. That was years ago. Then
on the Maloja—torpedoed (probably) some
time ago. Enthusiastic flappers used to talk
of the nimble Watt’s dancing as “divine”
—in the days when that was regarded as
part of a mail-boat purser’s education.
The rising star of the Society of Artists
is Elliott Griiner. His landscapes at the
exhibition to be opened this week show that
he has reached a stage further in his sur-
prising progress of the last few years.
Avoiding the pretty decorations which _ the
Harbor affords, he has tackled subjects
which require art to make them interesting.
You’ll see what he has done with a cow
and an old fence and a bit of paddock.
Griiner, of whom his friend David Low has
made me a sketch, was born in Maoriland
of Norwegian-Irish parents, and, like Corot,
began life in a shop. He was a pupil of
Julian Ashton’s for some time, and at an
early age set forth to pursue Fortune with
brushes and hope. Now he is Ashton’s col-
league as instructor, and his pictures are
amongst the best-sellers. Modesty is liis
principal weakness. “Story? Why, bless
you, I have none to tell,” he would say if
asked for biographical anecdotes, so I
didn’t ask him. He has spent most of his
time over the problems of painting light in
gumtrees, on ploughed fields, behind clouds
and other deceptive
places. With the ex-
ception of Mclnnes,
the young Victorian,
there is no Australian
landscape painter with
such fine achievement
for his age and such
promise of a brilliant
future.
GRUNER, painter.
When the last news came of Olive Kelso
King she was still driving a motor on ser-
vice work in Servia. The country is mag-
nificent from a scenic point of view. But
the depth and breadth of the swift and fre-
quently-flooded rivers keeps the plucky Syd-
ney girl as alert as the heroine of a movies’
thrill film. There are still some roubles left
in the Servian treasury, though the Generals
who pay their men mostly carry their
treasure in the heel o€ their top-boots.
Olive drove one such General and his staff
over a swirling torrent, on a narrow rail-
way bridge, with never a rail between the
tyres and the wild flood 60ft. below. All
went well till the return trip, when the car
bumped a small boulder hidden by shallow
water, and the petrol tank burst. A motor-
ambulance took the unhurt party the rest
of the journey, with Olive again at the
driving wheel. As a mark of gratitude for
her services the General wanted to lend the
maiden everything he possessed—including
toothbrush —when the party had to camp on
the journey.
Care to plunge to the extent of 2s. 6d.?
That’s the price of a ticket in the raffle for
the Edith Cavell Rest Home fund? If
you’re lucky you’ll take home a dressing-
case, valued at £3O. It’s in jeweller Hardy’s
window. Inquire within.
Ever give a thought to the stokers who
are helping to guard Australia in the North
Sea? Staff-Surgeon Brennand, of H.M.A.S.
Dash, writes about them to a Sydney friend.
“What of the heroes below, who are un-
known and generally unmentioned, while
Australians sleep in peace and security
14,000 miles away ? The stokers have to
keep the fires at such a heat, never know-
ing the instant the German navy may put
its nose out of its hiding-places, that their
lives are spent in a temperature that some-
times ends in death and occasionally in mad-
ness.” It’s month after month living in
the breath of engine fires that would roast
the toes off the Cold Foot Brigade in five
seconds.
Till the last few weeks we never realised
how many Hugheses there are in the world.
Three have met trouble all at once our
Billy, the Canadian War Minister, and the
gentleman with the beautiful beard who
hoped to write Uncle Sam’s Notes for three
years. Perhaps Helen, Billy’s small daugh-
ter, lately thought the world was peopled
with Hugheses, too. When the little family-
party made its grand-opera exit from Aus-
tralia by the Makura there were only two
babies on board. One was Helen. The other
was the tiny daughter of a bush-parson
Hughes, of Queensland.
There’s to be a concert in Sydney Town
Hall on November 25 in aid of the Lewisham
Hospital, Outpatients’ Department, and, as
a preliminary, there was a sale of flowers
and sweets outside the Australia on Friday,
the 17th. The Hospital does great work,
and its purse is getting too light to make the
outlook pleasant for the poor-patients
department.
Capes are fluttering around youthful
shoulders this summer. Generally they look
like a big slice of draughtboard, with a
blouse to make them fast to. i
Have you noticed the Valenciennes lace
now being made in Sydney? It is the real
thing. Most expert dressmakers say they
would not know the difference from that
made in the French centre. As a matter of
fact there isn’t any difference. .
Did you know that about 24 miles this
side of Newcastle—that’s the place coal used
to come from—flannel flowers grow by the
million? The native flora in this paradise is
something the Government might well pre-
serve. A picture postcard has just come in
from the irrepressible “Jimmie Pannikin,” in
which a group of men stand waist-deep in
the white velvet bloom.
The Ivambala Girls’ School grounds, Rose
Bay, were all a-flutter with bunting the
other afternoon. A fgte for the French
League, with Miss Gurney to make the
opening remarks, had some music in-
doors to soothe the savage breast of the
person who is pursued (even in dreams) by
raffle fiends. Orme Darvall lifted up his
voice at the young ladies’ pianoforte, and
the immaculate Archie Ranclaud, at the
piano, wore his best socks (and socks are
his specialty) for the event. Miss Roseby,
the principal, was assisted by a swarm of
pretty schoolgirls, under elegant crinkled
paper hats, and Archdeacon d’Arcy Irvine
gave the party his blessing.
“We must get this matinee well adver-
tised,” said hon. sec. Alderman Farrell, re-
ferring to the forthcoming performance for
the Llospice for the Dying. “Samson took
two solid columns and brought down the
house.” After that members of the huge
committee rushed to take tickets. It will
be a starry event. The Williamson Trust
will lend a few, including Dorothy
Brunton. Among the singers will be Mal-
colm McEachearn, Philip Newberry,
Josephine Marks and possibly Mrs. Alex.
Gordon, and others whose names are not to
hand. Criterion Theatre will be the scene,
and the time Thursday, December 14.
To aid the Edith Cavell House, Mrs.
Binnie and artist Theo Cowan are organis-
ing a special picture evening at the King
Hall, Hunter-street, and it is to happen
early next month. A returned officer-doctor
has given a series of lantern slides from
war pictures which he took at the Front,
and Blanch Blomfield from Potts Point
will call a description of each view.
Melba leaves this week for Honolulu by
the Niagara. Every year a Mid-Pacific car-
nival is held some time in February.
The firing of bombs and the explosion of
“day-fireworks” and the landing of the Car-
nival Kings in suitable fancy togs begin the
fuss. N. S. Wales is to send a contingent
of waratahs and a kangaroo to ride in the
Australian motor in the floral parade. Am-
brose Patterson, the artist who slaps on
Oriental color in generous mood, and Lionel
Walden, U.S.A. ■ brush-man, are helping to
plan the color orgy. And all Honolulu is
hoping that Melba will wait to see the
Mid-Pacific put hibiscus behind its ears.
The selling of flowers by battalion dames
is beginning to suffer from the old refrain —
“Everybody’s doing it!” Wanted, some in-
ventive brain to devise a new and original
scheme for dragging coppers from the passer-
by. Even a shop has its drawbacks. Just
as Mrs. Cbmforts Fund is building up a
brisk business on loan premises, the wretched
owner lets them or sells the building. Then,
it’s “Move on!”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

SPLENDID REMEDY FOR
CHILDREN’S COUGHS.
Mothers all over Australia are making in
their own homes as good a remedy as money
can buy for Coughs, Colds, Whooping Cough
Croup. Influenza, Bronchitis and Sore
Throats. All they do is buy from their
chemist or store 2s. worth of Hean’s Essence,
and add to it water and sweetening matter
enough to make up to one pint. Such a
quantity of ready-made cough mixtures
would cost at least 12s. The beauty of the
IT can’s Essence mixture is that it contains
no paregoric, laudanum or other opium
drugs, which are apt to do untold harm to
young children. — Advt.

Motor Tyre

Cup.
By their number
you shall judge
their popularity.
The greatest collection
of Motor Cars in Aus-
tralia is to be found
annually assembled at
Flemington ,on Cup
Day. An inspection
and count revealed the
partiality of the Motoring public as regards
the particular make of tyre they favored.
The figures tell the “real story” as to
what tyre finds most favor with Australian
Motorists. Certainly it is not with
American tyres, as some of their importers
are anxious for the public to believe.
Australian-made Dunlop Tyres easily
hold their own, and they hold it
because of the full value received in
mileage, and despite the heavy handicap
they iiave been faced with owing to ces-
sation of imports of European chassis and
resultant increase in imports of American
cars shod with American tyres. Look at
the appended figures and judge for your-
self what tyre does give the best service

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November 20. 1916
My Dear Yakkie, —
Saturday v. ore tlie right colors for an
Australian r.c:>ng day—blue skies and
golden sunshine. But it was Caulfield’s luck
again. The postponed F’lemington Steeple-
chase was still a week away, so the big
racing crowd and the remnant of tlie inter-
state visitors flocked out to the V.A.T.C.
fixture. The Forrest dame took no chances
with the weather, but wore a huge astra-
chan overcoat. She exulted over the large
“Yes” returned by the people of tile West,
and said she had not yet recovered from her
campaign labors. Tlie Best dame was out in
dark-navy duds, and little Mrs. Best-Broad
accompanied her in a light blue. Senator
Pearce haunted the birdcage, while his little
fawn-frocked lady was lost in the crowd
that kept to the stand. Nesta Clarke (Mt.
Schank) wore a pink blouse with her
boldly-striped black-and-white flannel suit,
and wandered about looking at the horses
with Mrs. Purves.
George Melba Armstrong delighted the
birdcage with a delicate grey race-coat, and
mentioned that mother was busy packing
her blue-and-wliite-striped hat for the beach
at Honolulu. Russell Gabb, wreathed in
delicate grey toggery and smiles, exulted
over Londonderry’s easy win in the Steeple-
chase. His happy wife floated on air in
amber and brown. Andrew Chirnside, who
always looks as much as possible like a
sporty English squiah, received congratula-
tions on his win with Edrington. His small
relation-by-marriage. Miss Fenner, joyfully
stowed away her winnings in a blue peggy-
bag. Jack Pearson, from the Andrew Chirn-
side corner of the world, wore a rich grin.
Mrs. Ranclaud, from Sydney, had a green-
and-fawn striped silk suit. Mining-man
Millican, from Charters Towers, was a large,
distinguished figure in grey hair, grey mous-
tache and grey clothes, and entertained a
big party at lunch. A Russian military
doctor, who is here on furlough, wore a
striking uniform with lovely knee-high boots.
Oaks was the day of fur coats. All the
women hoped for a let-up in the weather
and a chance to show the frock underneath.
Mrs. Sasanof Stead, in plain navy blue
and some furs, played about with Mrs.
Leslie Stuart, who was in comfortable blue
serge. Mrs. Wilkinson walked iu neat
black cloth, and tlie dress critics stared
enviously. She was a Falkiner, you know,
and had boxes of money left to her in tlie
division of the Falkiner estate. She mar-
ried young lawyer Wilkinson, son of the
Judge, and spends most of her time in
Deniliquin. Dr. Barfy Thompson showed a
lovely little series of neat inner vests when
he flung liis greatcoat back. His wife
walked regally in the expensive comfort of
black velvet and ermine furs. Mrs. Tom
Whyte had wonderful sables covering her
putty-clotli suit. Mrs. Connolly wore
ermine and a ducky blue suit lined with
amber. She dared a yellpw-and-white mus-
lin Toby collar, and her complexion trium-
phantly. stood the test. Airs. Jack Wallace
wore iron-grey to match her husband’s fas-
cinating hair. Airs. Buchanan was barely
visible outside her furs. She carried a
sporty brolly with a large silver racing
horse at full gallop for a handle. Mrs.
Skelly (she was one of the Morrow girls,
of Ballarat) came in pink cheeks and a
blue-cloth dress. Mrs. Davey, an ex-
Alayoress of the city, wore navy and a hat
turned up all round with ribbon bows in
the latest demented fashion. She and the
debonair Davey dined and bridged at Men-
zies’ after the race with Sydney friends.
Sam Hordern, young Kitchen and Mr.
Phillips were three of the party. Balsillie
roamed about in grey clothes and didn’t
seem frightened of rain. It is his business
to make it now.
Lesley Madden, Airs. Barry Thompson
and Airs. Cooper (Maoriland) have been
busy counting up the gains of a small but
intense bazaar they worked at St. Ivilda
to help Father Garidy and his Church of
the Sacred Heart. There is still a 60-
guinea suite of furniture to be raffled, and
Walter Kirby is to sing at the drawing this
week. A pair of diamond earrings raffled
at sixpence a ticket, were won by a little
orphan schoolgirl who had saved her pennies
for the gamble. The child is getting Mar-
guerite joy out of the sparkling vanities.
Lady Stanley has had to work overtime
since his E£. urns ordered to rest. She put
in a strenuous half-hour opening the show
of carnations at the Town Hall, and then
she motored away under a flower-wreathed
bonnet to lay the foundation-stone of the
Seamen’s Institute. Instinct tells me that
she then went home and amused her husband
by telling him what she'd intended to say
and had disremembered at the critical
moment. Alen, of course, never do that.
The wild, squally weather of Oaks Day
left the wives of two prominent hookies
quite undaunted. They used no muffling
wraps to disguise the summery Watteau
masterpieces their dressmakers had built for
them. Puffed and hellowered brocades bil-
lowed over calf-high kilted skirts and the
hats that become a shepherdess on a vase
bent, in the wind. One- of the promenaders
even carried a large crook decorated with
tulle streamers. The other carried a para-
sol (or a Cleopatra canopy) made of cloth-
of-gold and trimmed all round the edge with
large black ostrich-feather plumes. The two
dreams of a long summer’s day walked the
lawn in chilly splendor..
Melba said good-bye for three months to
her Conservatorium classes on Monday, and
asked -them all to a party on the Friday
to wind up the season's screeching. She
is off to Honolulu "to lie on the beach and
just loaf.” Incidentally, she is taking pro-
tege Peggy Centre hack to her Honolulu
home. Carruthers, of the Lazy Isle, is
also travelling back, and Melba has a Pat-
terson niece in the party. Son George and
his wife are staying at home at Coombe in
quiet domesticity until mother comes march-
ing home.
The Maoriland Steads, after winning the
Cup with Sasanof, got their pals together
at Menzies’ and gave them the cheeriest of
dinners. The Cup was filled to the brim
with champagne and passed round the
circle while Di Gilio’s band, for joy of
gold and wine, played in frenzy. Goloshes
were then slipped over satin shoes and
umbrellas grasped in white-gloved hands,
and the party hurried forth in the wet to
Wirths’ Circus, where they witnessed the
presentation of a gold-mounted whip to
Fred Foley, the victorious animal’s steers-
man. The revel ended at the Savoy.
Sasanof Stead and his wife went back
home to Maoriland last week, leaving Mel-
bourne to finish its Cup meetings when it
could. Tlie Steeplechase and the final day’s
gallops were still a week away when they
departed. The owner of the Cup winner
felt very bad about the Savoy Cafe raid on
the night of the glorious victory. The six
o’clock regulation was so new that he con-
sidered the authorities might have let him
make a Sasanoffertory of supper cham-
pagne for every table at the Savoy. As it
was, the swift animal’s health had to be
drunk in Spa water or stone gingerbeer—
and a man feels let down when he has to
give his guests that. Mrs. Stead, by the
way, is a little lady who made all her out-
door appearances in quietly smart-tailored
clothes. She is a daughter of John Roberts,
of Dunedin, where no one weeps over the
wine that is left corked.
Mrs. Hughes never quite gets used to hear-
ing ’her Prime Minister speak in public.
While he is unwinding great lengths of
multi-colored, prose to a packed congregation
she is feverishly interested in his oratorical
goods, as well as in the interjections, just as
though the black dot on the platform were
seeking the suffrages of his maiden constitu-
ency. Then, when the last hurst comes and
the congregation roars in approval, a look
of beatific calm spreads itself over the face
of the lady, and she completely forgets for
the moment that the same ordeal will hai e
to he endured to-morrow night or next week.
George Gray, the pale young billiard
champion, was married last week. His
bride was Miss Sheehan, a daughter of the
Treasury Hotel family, and the pair of
them have been honeymooning in the fierce
light of Oriental Hotel life. She is a
buxom girl with the rosy cheeks of a milk-
maid, and her trousseau clothes have had
the women staring. The day she was
married Orientalists had the luck to see
the new bride hop out of a taxi wearing
a navy-blue cloth tailored suit with a fringe
of small red ivory spheres about the size
of plums round the hem of the skirt. She
carried a long wooden cue-case, and seemed
prepared generally to play the part of
marker for life.
Beatrice Henty, honorary superintendent
of the Patriotic League, is one of the few
people in good spirits over the sinking of the
Arabia. The League, which works with the
Sydney War Chest organisation in forward-
ing forget-you-nots to the men in the trenches,
has lately sent several weighty consignments
by departing vessels, and had another well *
under way for despatching at the time of
the Arabia’s departure. But by good fortune
nothing went aboard the torpedoed boat; so
the League is on the right side to the extent
of a large batch- of underwear, chocolate,
fine-toothcombs, smokes, cards, corn-plasters
and the dozens of similar trifles which are of
such tremendous importance to the war-worn
soldier who can’t just slip out and buy some.
Singer Minnie Waugh-Orr has been en-
gaged by the Wellington (M.L ) Choral
Society to take part in “The Messiah,” on
December 7. Minnie is at present honey-
mooning. Her bridegroom is the genial ex-
widower Alexander Orr, of Christchurch,
whose job is hardware of some sort.
Flautist Amadio is chirping the glad news
that unto him a child is born, unto him a
daughter is given.
Mrs. Cherry read a letter from a hospital
nurse in France at the annual meeting ot the
Victoria League the other day. “A cigar-
ette and a Bulletin are the first things a
wounded man asks for when he is able to sit
up and take notice,’’ said the writer. Read-
ers of the paper were implored to send on
their copies when-.finished with, but to take
the precaution of concealing the blushing
cover under the skirt of more righteous jour-
nals, otherwise it was unlikely to reach its
journey’s end.
Dorothy, last and youngest of the Dande-
nong-road Christian girls, has thrown herself
to her lion —John Dupstan, lieut. A. 1.1., a
son of Ambrose Dunstan, an old Bendigo-
nian. There have been many to call around
and help themselves from the Christian
arena in Dandenong-road. Lieut.-Colonel
Player, .A.A.M.C., was one of them, and
Hugh Trumble another, with Captain Bar-
clay, of Tassy, and one of the late Tom
Buxton’s boys. Papa Christian, has been
dead many years, but the mining dividends he
piled up have kept his memory green at
Malvern ever since.
The Hector MacDonald matron hostessed
a select tea and bun frivol on Wednesday
afternoon. Melba was the guest of honor,
and brought the Honolulu singing girl,
who performed at intervals to tremendous
applause.
Admiral Bridges has gone with daughter
Olive to his Western District place, where
the sheep are. Mrs. Admiral, with the rest
of the progeny in tow, is waiting in Eng-
land until her husband and daughter Olive
signal for her.
Reggie Power, who last year went to
England and was put into a cavalry offi-
cer’s trappings, got dead sick of plain home
service at last. After worrying round for
weeks, he was allowed to stray into a hum-
bler kind of regiment booked for the
trenches, and he has since been in the midst
of trouble. Wife Phyllis will while away
her grasswidowhood by getting into a volun-
tary nurse’s rig.
Adelaide’s contribution:—
Although Saturday teemed with rain and the
wind cut to the bone the money-raising patriots suc-
cessfully carried out most of the fixtures arranged.
A carnival at Campbelltown began with a pageant-
march from the East End market through the city
and down the long-drenched road that leads to
the Eastern Suburbs. It was a clear case for the
V.C. Pending the arrival of that decoration, about
£5OO will be added to the Repatriation Fund. The
Prospect Repatriation Committee postponed its car-
nival ; but the Mitcham Red Cross Society went
ahead with a fair in the Edwardstown Institute.
Lady Galway did the official uncorking. At Plymp-
ton there was a garden fete, arranged by Mrs. Rex
Wallman and her sister-in-law - and Miss Ada Mar-
tin, and though the entertainments had to be
hurriedly moved from the garden into the house
and verandahs the comforts of the 3rd Light Horse
will want more room on the cargo manifest. Our
latest venture is a Red Cross Tea Garden, which
is to be open every Wednesday on the roof of
Verco Buildings. Mrs. M. A. Goode presides over
a committee , of enthusiastic girls, and Lady Galway
has promised to sample their first brew on Novem-
ber 29.
. From England Comes news of the engagement of
Miss Emeline Tait, daughter of the Gifford Taits,
to Lieut. 11. G. Furness.
The Society of Arts opened its nineteenth Fed-
eral exhibition at North Terrace on Monday with
about 140 canvases from this State and Victoria. On
the whole the work shown is poor, and only a
couple of purchases were made for the Gallery.
The Sidney Kidman aeroplane accounted for its
first kill while in charge of Lieut. J. B. Graham,
who lived at our Yankalilla till a few years ago.
He was in England when war broke out, and after
putting in 12 months in the trenches near Ypres
he joined the Royal Flying Corps. In September
last he was sent to St. Omer to take over a new
machine, which proved to be the South Australian
No. 1. While on his way back to his base after
the trial flight he encountered two Hun machines,
and settled one and chased the other off.
An 18-months-old child that can fall backwards
into a disused well, and lodge, practically unhurt, on
a ridge of earth at a depth of 30ft. must be re-
served for something special. The adventurous in-
fant was rescued, by a soldier just back from France
'on side leave. He went down the well with two
old sash ropes, but was afraid to risk the return
journey on them with the child in his arms, and
waited till ladders could be fastened together and
lowered to the rescue. Disappointed “movie” men
want it done all over again, but baby’s ma has
some objection or other.
Another show of paintings by the late
Walter Withers and his daughter will be
“on” at the Athenaeum Hall from November
30. For this occasion Mrs. Withers is get-
ting together a loan collection of her hus-
band’s biggest works to help make a brave
display. Admiral Cresswell’s wife will open,
the exhibition.
Edward Branscombe, king of the Dan-
dies, again took unto himself a wife the
other day. She is Miss Clarke, of Sydney.
A common interest in theosophy brought
their heads together, and it was not long
before their hands followed suit. The new
Mrs. Branscombe is an ornament of the
nursing profession, and is said to be comfort-
ably provided with brains.
At the Austral Salon on Friday night the
Australian National Theatre Company
(which is not quite as important as it
sounds) put on a couple of its Pale Plays
for Peculiar People. One was a two-act
melodrama, “The Gathering of Gold,” and
the other “A Family Affair,” a one-act warn-
ing to punters. Mrs. E. C. Davidson was
leading lady, “producer” and suspected
authoress, although the company makes a
virtue of anonymity.
Lawyer Louis Waxman is seriously ill,
and a [ arge portion of Melbourne feels sor-
rowfully concerned about it. Waxman is
ab intensely-cultured bundle of nerves. He
j s one the most musical Melbournites, but
m i X es a little racing with his concerts and
operas. Inter-State visitors have missed
b j m a t recent meetings.
Collins-street had a grin on one of its
recent wet afternoons. The rain was tum-
biing down, and gutters were running bank-
wben people sheltering in doorways and
unde r verandahs saw a stout, bell-toppered
gentleman, a man of municipal importance
- n a neighboring State, coming down the hill
f roru the vicinity of the Athenaeum Hall full
to overflowing, and carrying over his head
an umbrella, of which nothing remained but
ribg and band l e . The rain soaked the good
mail) but on be came, happily unconscious
bis m i s f o rtunes. A friend encountered
b | m on tbe Age office steps. “Hello!” said
the friend jocosely. “Wet, isn’t it?” “It
is.” he replied, “but fortunately I was able
to borrow an umbrella.”

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGIN-
ALITES
“Chalcopyrite”: Let me wedge in Pat
Leahy and Ben Howelet, who drove 42 horses hooked
to one waggon holding up 20 tons of poppet-legs
from the Charters Towers railway station to the
Brilliant Deep Mine in 1887.
‘Bad Australian”: Another of my pet
superstitions has gone by the board. I always believed
that eucalypts were frost-proof, but the exceptional
weather which has lately prevailed throughout the
Argentine has convinced me to the contrary. In the
province of Buenos Aires plantations of four- or five-
year old gums look as if a fire had run through
them, leaving their leaves brown and scorched. Old
trees do not seem to be affected except at the ends
of the upper branches, but in all the irrigated pro-
vinces of Mendoza and San Juan trees'of 20 years’
growth have been as badly frost-bitten as the young
plantations grown under natural rainfall. Towards
the end of the Big Drought I saw many acres of
eucalypts fade and cast their leaves and in some cases
die outright, but during many years’ work and wan-
dering in the Australian and Tasmanian bush I never
saw nor heard of a “frosted” eucalypt. Is there any
record of such an occurrence in Australia? Inci-
dentally, the provinces of Buenos Aires and Mendoza
are on the same parallel as Sydney. San Juan is
about 100 kilometer's farther north.
‘Billy T”: I’ve seen the Australian pro-
totype of the wild western maiden. She is not
beautiful, but she is tough ; she has a face like a
popular featherweight who has survived to be a
veteran, only harder; and her riding costume con-
sists of a blue-grey Crimean shirt, a pair of men’s
pants, and an old divided skirt—divided hv the
simple process of cutting it from hem to waistband,
fore and aft. She is a poor relation of the breeder
who employs her, and she is there to ride anything
that is yarded. After seeing . her operating for
half an hour, I am convinced that as a living-picture
specialist there is a million in her. She was deal-
ing with a little red beast that had to be broken
to the skirt, and she went at him. In two and
three-quarter secs, she was off. 1 rushed to her
assistance, babbling commiseration. This is not the
time .nor the place to record what she said to me.
No lady would have said it. I returned to the rails.
Honora returned to her horse. He had more con-
vulsions. Honora was off again. For the third
time she hoarded the quadruped, and three times
he resented the intrusion. Four times, five times
the girl fell before the disgusted heddy threw up
the sponge and signified his acceptance of a subordi-
nate position. Then, as a sort of half-and-half apology
for her rude refusal of well-meant attentions, she
explained: “See, sonny, knowin’ how to stay on is
on’y half of this game. The other half is knowin’
how to fall off.”
* * * «
“Corio”: Much mud has been recently
pelted at me because I accused a tree which split
into 150 fencing-posts of being something pheno-
menal. Well, only three years ago the Forestry
Department of N. S. Wales filed the yield as the
best authenticated record up to that time. An
awful lot of rubbish has been talked on the subject.
For instance, one Abo-ite says a tree 50ft. high
and 12ft. in girth split .300 fencing-posts. Apply
arithmetic and we get approximately 3000 super
feet, plus piping, in such a sapling. It requires only
100 posts of reasonable size (9ft. x 6in., let us say)
to cut out this amount.
THE DYSPEPTIC.
THE BLOKE IN THE BACKGROUND : “He doesn't look well.”
THE TART DO. : “No, he married for money."
THE BLOKE: “I see . And his wife is ton rich to agree with him.”
THE LAST STRAW,
OUTRAGED SON : “Look 'ere! I don’t mind yer puttin’ me Sunday clobber up the spout
for booze, but when it comes to poppin’ a bloke’s football guernsey — Come on!
I'UT ’EM UP!”
*‘Tiaki” : Henare Topoi has an altitude of
two yards odd and a squatting weight of 2241 b.
One night he approached Terence O’Hop, and in an
agitated manner told him that “tsum ferra he peen
trunk town my prace. Oh, he te p-a-aad proke an’
he peen kissin’ my missis an’ orate kirl. Te onary
pest way you run him in.” “Pwhat sort av a felley
is he? ’ asked the John Hopkins. “Huh! He onary
te rittle ferra—easy you do him,” answered Henare.
O’Hop looked at Topoi in disgust and drew a half-
sozzled individual out from the house and stored
him for reference attached to a charge of “being
illegally on premises,” etc. He was almost inarticu-
late and sagging the whole length of his five feet
five inches. “Why didn’t you throw that bloke out
yourself?’ asked the John. “He’s only a rabbit of
a man.” “Oh, no good I t’row te ferra out, you
know,” said Henare sagely. “S’pose-it I prakc his
pressid neck—werra, I get te shummons an’ I kst
fine te cupple-a-quid. You know, he cos’ me werry
10 pob to fill te ferra up wit’ te whisky. How te
tewwil I koin’-a get him tchuck out if I toan’? He
te prurry pailiff, an’ I know te raw!”

“Wandi”: From the deep grasses and
herbage by the scrub, more particularly in the
gullies and along the banks of rivers and creeks, the
pheasant-coucal is flushed. It is a cheeky, saucy-
looking bird. The general color of its coarse, spiny
plumage is mottled brown and chestnut, with a
freckled greeny patch on the rump. The long, blotched
brown tail is also glossed with green. The full
adult birds have black head, bill, neck and abdomen,
while the corresponding parts of the young birds
are brown, striped with a lighter shade, and the
bill is horn-colored. The sexes are alike, except that
the male is slightly smaller than the female. They
are commonly known as swamp pheasant and brush
pheasant, and many people use the names distinct-
ively, mistaking the mature and the immature for
two species. By some the flesh is considered capital
eating. On account of the bird’s partiality for hen-
eggs poultry farmers show it no mercy. It is easily
shot, rising with slow, labored flight to a low branch
of a bushy tree, whence it ascends to the top in quick
runs and hops, uttering a sibilant, “qwisheuw” at fre-
quent intervals and looking down at the enemy with
resentment in its reddish eyes. It spends most of its
time on the ground, making up for what it lacks in
wing-.-power by the rapidity with which it can scuttle
through matted grasses. Here, in spring and summer,
its architectural powers are revealed in a long, dome-
shaped grass nest with two openings and a central
depression, in which three to five round, limy-white
eggs are placed. A little track extends from each
opening, for the female enters by the front door and
makes her exit through the back. When on the nest
her tail protrudes at one end and her head at the
other.
“Poddy”: Here’s something about a kero-
sene tin that ought to be taught in the bush schools.
It holds 281 b. of spuds, 101 b. of bran, 201 b. of oats,
301 b. of wheat or peas, 251 b. of barley or 281 b. of
maize, In fact, for all' practical purposes it is a
half-bushel measure, as it contains 1073.25 cubic
inches, while a bushel encloses 2150.4 cubic inches.
Also the receptacle will hold four gallons of cow
juice if beer is not available.
COLD.
BOSS (waking him up with his boot): “Shake
it up, Billy; I want it early start."
BILLY (blowing frost off his whiskers):
“Bery early climate about here, Boss!”
‘“Daybreak”: Let the gormands come and
dine with me. My dish is porcupine. Stuffed and
baked it is a feast for gods and bookmakers. The
flesh is somewhat similar to, but far better than, the
Christmas sucking-pig.
(Continued on page 24. )
SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once more the joyous Spring comes round.
With warm, life-waking breath,
To rouse the sluggish sap it found
Quiescent as in death.
The trees’ green life-blood stirs amain, '
Eager to mount and run ;
While first-born leaves new-washed in rain
Dance in the wind and sun.
There is a hill of stunted trees
Where the first sunrays roam ;
Where, tossed by many a vagrant breeze,
Gleams golden vvattie fdam.
There is a lyre-bird struts and calls
In all his bush mates’ tones,
Beside the tumbling waterfalls,
Among the mould-strewn stones.
There night brings balm for daylight's loss
With starshine crystal-clear;
Over yon hill leans out the Cross.
A friendly sign and near
But wondrous night, or perfect day,
The pure air crisp and sweet —
Spring, or the lyre-bird’s varied lay,
I*o more with joy I greet.
Above the bush-birds’ happy notes
My spirit sense can hear
The voices from the cannon throats—
Doom voices, faint, but clear.
Though blade and leaf to sunshine rhyme,
And wild wings flirt and glance,
My thoughts are of the harvest time —
Death’s harvest time in France!
And what if Death should garner him,
In some red swathe laid low—
The boy who said, stern-eyed and grim :
“No use, Dad, / must go”?
He heard the call of tortured lands,
His young eyes caught the gleam :
To that large task he set his hands
And dreamt a soldier’s dream.
For him the brief, tense moments, ere,
With battle-lust elate,
He storms through Hell the foemen’s lair—
For us the dreary wait!
The golden sunlight filters through
Where velvet shadows dance;
I look above to skies of blue—
Ah God! the skies of France!

“It is ill arguing with a hungry man,” says the
old proverb. But it is worse playing tricks with a
sick one. When the doctor orders brandy he means
real good stuff —the best.” Give the patient
Martell’s, and both he and his doctor will be
satisfied. Being rich in the higher ethers it is
unequalled in case of sickness.
Besides, it is perfect for social purposes.

She Darkened Her Grey Hair
A Society Lady Darkened Her Grey Hair
and Stimulated Its Growth by a
Simple Home Process.
She Tells How She Did It.
A well-known society lady, who darkened
her grey hair by a simple home process,
made the following statement: “Any lady
or gentleman can darken their grey or faded
hair, stimulate its growth and make it soft
and glossy with this simple recipe, which
they can mix at home. To a half-pint of water
add loz. of bay rum and 1 small box of
Orlex Compound. These ingredients can
be purchased at any chemist’s at very little
cost. Apply to the hair every other day;
until the grey hair is darkened sufficiently.:
This mixture relieves itching and is excel-
lent for dandruff. It does not stain the
scalp, is not sticky or greasy and does not
rub off. It will make a grey-hairrd person
look 10 to 20 years younger.”—Advt. [3
MAKES THE WEAK AND THIN
STRONG AND FAT.
Weak and thin people—those who are
troubled with indigestion, nervousness, sleep-
lessness, liver trouble, etc. —can become
strong, fat and hearty if they will only use
a little commonsense. Just bear in mind
that it’s not what you eat but what you
assimilate that makes flesh and strength;
and that the nerves directly control the pro-
cess of assimilation- —the conversion of food
into flesh. Weakness, thinness, sleepless-
ness, nervousness, etc., are all signs that
your nerves are weak and must be strength-
ened by a proper tonic food before they can
hope to do their work properly. For this
purpose there is nothing like the plain, old-
fashioned nerve tonic and flesh builder the
chemists prepare by mixing i ounce Tinc-
ture Cardamoms Compound, 2 ounces Sal-
rado Compound, 3 ounces Elixir Simplex and
2J ounces water. One or two tablespoonfuls
of this tonic 20 minutes before eating or
whenever you feel weak, tired or nervous
will freshen you up amazingly, and if used
regularly for a week will, by building up and
strengthening the nervous system, overcome
those complaints and symptoms due to weak,
devitalised nerves. You will be full of
energy and vitality, and should put on two
or three pounds of firm, solid flesh every
week. In fact, on account of its flesh-
building properties, it should not be taken
bv neople who do not want to put on flesh.

“Vigilans”: Another word about “Wheel-
barrow Joe.” lie was camped at Newcastle Waters
when I was there,’ and he told me that he had pushed
the barrow all over the continent. His ambition
was to shove it round the world. He thought nothing
of long and dry tracks. The worst in Australia, in
his opinion, was from Denial Bay to Coolgardie.
He started from Port Lincoln during the Cool-
gardie rush, pushed the one-wheeler to Murat Bay
along the Bight, thence across the Nullarbor Plains
to Eucla. From the telegraph station he trudged
to Eyre’s Sand Patch due west, and then north-west
to Norseman and the rush. It was a fearful under-
taking. I went across the same track in 1902, but
the track was then watered by tanks, though some of
them were dry 1 . They were placed under a shed
with a corrugated-iron roof as catchment. There
were a few underground tanks in the track, but
they were mostly contaminated by dead rabbits.
Joe Bagshaw used to chuckle over the way he raised
the wind in Coolgardie. He picked up a mate on
the rofid, and they arranged that he (the stranger)
should gammon sickness. A mile or so from the
diggings lie got into the machine and Joe pushed
him to the canvas townlet. When the hat came back
it was bulging.

“Wart”: Did “Tiaki’s” editor (B.
12/10/’l6) who was fond of a feed of wood-grub
get his education at Horton College (Tas.) ? Any
traveller on the main road from Hobart to Laun-
ceston will remember the big stone building which
40 years ago was the top-notch school of Tassy. I
have never yet met anyone educated there who did
not acquire the taste for the grubs. Eaters describe
the roasted article as being like almonds. Supplies
from she-oak and wattle were most in demand, those
from gum-trees being too highly flavored. Talking
about luxuries, how many bush cooks have tried
baldcoot and native hen? A good fat young speci-
men of the latter served up as wild duck would
deceive the most experienced duck worrier that ever
crunched a bone.
* * * *
“De Oriel” : I know two men who share
two beds. They are the coach-pilots who run the
daily 50-miles between Corryong and Tallangatta
(Vic.). They have a bed at each town, and as both
coaches start early in the morning the drivers take
the beds alternately. As the vehicles jangled past
each other about half-way I was startled to hear our
man cry: “Did you make my bed?” and the shouted
answer: “Yes! Did you make mine?”
RACE WEEK IN MELBOURNE.
OLD DAD: “ That’s strange! I weigh the
same with my duds off as I do with ’em
on.”
“Light Up”: The train to Ivoondrook
(Vic.) stops anywhere if you wave a handkerchief or
shake a stick at it. One day a swaggie gave it a
hail at a road crossing. “ ’Struth, I’m glad I
caught you,” he said to the guard when the train
had pulled up. “Lend me a match, will you? I’m
dead-beat for a smoke.”
Another casual Australian. This time it
was a bush kiddy a few years old who, returning
home after exploring the vicinity, brought a full-
g:rown black snake cuddled up in her arms. The
deadly thing was quite satisfied until a terrified
dad tried to get it away. At that it reared up
and struck savagely at the disturber of harmony.
The kiddy was then induced to drop her new toy,
and there were no beg-pardons about the ensuing
proceedings.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: Pass in the moke endurance
argument, and let’s have a look at what the two-
legged animal can do. Years back, when roads
existed in name only between Mount Pleasant and
Adelaide, G. Melrose, sen., of Rosebank, started for
the city per blucher. He covered the 60 miles in
under 24 hours. In the big drought Bill Watson,
son of V.R.C.’s starter, of Currawilla, Far West
Queensland, got as far as Adavale on his way home.
Horses being unavailable, he filled the waterbag,
poked his nose towards the homestead, and hit out.
The 130-odd miles were left behind in three days.
Dming the same drought Watson used to leave the
station before daylight to walk to Monkira, on the
Diamantina, 45 miles away, to attend the Board
meetings, and next day start back after sundown.
While this same drought was over the land Spring-
vale, out from Boulia (N.Q.), was isolated. Meat
of a sort was procurable 25 miles away at the
bullock-hole,” and when the boss and his stockmen
became bored with galah they would walk over the
waterless stretch, shoot the best-looking steer stag-
geiing in to drink, dress the meat on the spot and
hump it home.
* * *
Gold Medal” : Old Hardcase was “round-
ing up his son in his usual Monday-morning style:
“Come on, Joe, now; get to work. Must get that
paddick turned over ’fore the rain comes.” “Oh,
I’m gettin’ sick o’ work,” drawled Joe. “Week after
week and never a fiver to me name. What’s .the
good? What do I get out of it?” “Oh, well, yeh
can’t have everything, yer know,” said the old man.
“If yeh work well and look after the place it’ll all
be yours when I’m gone.” “That’s all very well,”
retorted Joe; “but what I’d like ter know is: When
thell are yeh goin’ ter get a move on?”
“E.S.S.”: The “Big Scrub,” towards the
Tweed (N.S.AV.) and the jungles further north, once
teemed with pigeons, among them the “superb,”
“magnificent,” “white-headed” and “topknot.” They
were all extensive travel-
lers, following the ripeh-
ing fruits, such as the figs,
wild grapes and palm
nuts. The topknot is the
largest of the fruit pigeons,
an arboreal, gregarious,
black-marked grey bird
with a dull-red crest,
rosy-red bill and purple
feet; but its flesh is not
so good as that of the
others, being coarse and
dry. The superb is yel-
lowish green, with grey
breast, white underparts
and orange feet. The
male differs from the
female in having a purple
crown and blue-black
shoulders. The magnifi-
cent, an attractive, yel-
lowy-green bird, with grey
head and neck and deep-
purple breast and abdo-
men, was particularly
plentiful in the fig season,
its loud, oft-repeated cry
and the commotion it
made among the fruiting
branches betraying it at
a considerable distance. It
used to come like the
satin birds; for a long
time there would be none
at all in the brushes, then
one morning we would
discover a noisy, greedy
host of them, flapping and
feasting till the heavy
branches shook and swayed
with their weight. The
white-headed specimen ap-
peared also in large flocks.
A strong-flying, heavy bird
with white head, neck and
breast, blackish wings and
touches of bronzy purple
on back and rump, it is
more conspicuous in a tall,
dense tree than any other
excepting the white nut-
meg, a member of the
family found only in the
extreme North.
GOING TOO FAR.
BOSS: “Well, Jacky, why did the recruiting-sergeant turn down a man like you?”
J ACKY: “Him say, ‘Oh, gib the plurry Cher mans a chance.’"
“Rag”: The Afghan camel men of the
Golden West revel in notoriety as litigants and pay
gladly to get it. Abdul Zarezi,. of Menzies, lost a
fowl. On his way to the mosque, at the shrill-voiced
summons of the muezzin, he saw some freshly-plucked
feathers of a Plymouth Rock in Mohammed Khan’s
dirty goat yard. That afternoon, resplendently arrayed
in his best and baggiest bloomers, gold-braided, blue-
velvet vest and a new vermilion turban, Abdul
whooshtaed his tasselled and decorated dromedary at
the police station and took out a summons against
his friend. That evening they sat side by side over
the communal hubble-bubble and enthusiastically
discussed their forthcoming suit. When the case
came oij it was fought with 14 witnesses a-side,
lasted two days and ended in a draw. The prin-
cipals and their counsel then met to decide a bet
of fizz for the crowd as to who had had the most
exhilaration at the least expense. Abdul’s excite-
ment had cost £l9 ss. and Khan’s £l7 15s.
Abdul’s bill for two magnums of champagne was
£3 and Mohammed was so elated at his success that
he paid for two more himself.
* * * *
“Pick”: About jibbing horses. At Goul-
burn (N.S.W.) I once saw horse-tamer McGillvray
(“Professor Rider”) win £5 from a sceptic who
staked the money that a crock he owned could not be
made to pull a buggy and two men up Church Hill.
McGillvray simply discarded traces and hitched the
moke’s tail to the swingle-bar. The unusual attach-
ment so surprised the slacker that he hit the road
only about twice in his hurry up the stiff pinch. We
hit it only once—at the top. The pub was there.
* * * *
“Bill Bedsox” : Another Anzac Junior. A
neighbor borrowed a coil of fencing-wire and said
he would send one of his lads across for it—.maybe
half a mile. In due course the lad appeared. He
was fully 10 years of age. When I laughed at the
idea of his being able to carry a hundredweight of
wire he said, “But I can roll it!” Before I recovered
young Anzac had trundled his hoop nearly half-way,
and when I overtook him and relieved him of his
load he was as wild as a snake.
“The Reefer”: Papua possesses an indi-
genous nut (okari) which, were it introduced to
Australia, would become a favorite. It grows on
the banks of inland streams ; when ripe is reddish-
bronze skinned, and in shape and size is like a
goose egg. The kernel has a delicate almondy-
filbert flavor. I have seen the ground beneath the
okari tree ankle deep with these fine nuts. Scien-
tifically cultivated, they would doubtless be con-
siderably improved in size. Apart from their com-
mercial possibilities the trees would blush at the
fervent admiration of their good looks.
“Buly True”: About 20 years ago a N.Q.
bdac-kfellow named Cungala was killed by lightning
and a young buck not long in camp was charged
with “pointing the bone” at him. Accused pro-
tested his innocence, and, in reply, was told that
if he could dodge 50 boomerangs thrown one at a
time from a distance of 20 yards the tribe would
take his word for it, but if he was hit he was
found guilty of murder. He stood 14 and then
confessed. I don’t know what they did with him,
but he didn’t turn up at the store for tobacco any
more.

Studebaker Ownership—
a Mark of Distinction
To own a Studebaker is a mark of distinction—a
sign and proof of excellent judgment in motor cars.
i
" I ' l i ere ,'® a , n atm °sphere of distinction and refinement about
a Studebaker car that marks its owner as belonging to the
most exclusive circles. Its graceful body lines, finish and
top-notch equipment reflect a wisdom of selection that
Duuds prestige for the owner.
Another evidence of superiority is furnished by the fact
that Studebakers are hard to secure. Demands made by
people who know what it means to own a Studebaker have
been so great that one is fortunate if he can secure earlv
delivery of a Studebaker.
We have a variety of Studebaker models to choose from.

Enid Bennett, who went to the U.S.A.

“S.S.”: The Australian McLeans, Decima
and Eddie, are back in Melbourne. Have we
had better entertainers in their line? These
dancers have been 12 or 14 years on the Aus-
tralian stage, and Decima is a veteran at,
say, 21. During that time we have had many
good whirlwind dancers, all of whom have
taught the McLeans something, but we have
never had a brighter or better turn of this
kind. The McLeans have all the qualities
necessary to carry them spinning into the
hearts of Parisian audiences, and they have
remained a half-way-down-the-bill item hi ail
sorts of Australasian variety shows. _ When
the war is over, Paris should be “a gift” for
dancers like Decima and Eddie, branded
‘‘Made in Australia.”
“Private Boxer”: That “the Australian
play by the distinctive Australian writer is
as far away as ever,” as “Stargazer” con-
tends (B. 9/11/’l6), is, I am afraid, mostly
the distinctive writer’s own fault. If a book
be adapted for the stage by another hand
the play cannot be expected to exactly con-
vey the original author’s ideas, or catch his
spirit, or retain his “atmosphere.” Com-
petent adaptors are few and far between in
any country. Why, then, does not the origi-
nal author set about learning the technique
of the stage and turn out his own version ot
his own work, and when he has turned it out
insist on it being staged as he wrote it.'
We should then hear less about “the little
living Australian meat hung on the same old
imported bones.” As it is, we should be
grateful that some recent specimens of local
play-building are holding the boards and
drawing money. The money doesn’t go to
xlmerican dramatists, anyhow!
A popular bellowdrama in Berlin these
times is entitled “Bluejackets,” the hero
being commander of a submarine. A great
sensation scene depicts the sinking of an
American passenger liner at night. Panic
reigns aboard the vessel when the submarine
comes to light. Then the gallant hero climbs
aboard and soothes the shrieking passengers
with the announcement that he, being a true
Hun humanitarian, will give them time to
get away in the lifeboats. The stage is dark-
ened and the ship is presently torpedoed to
destruction, with the Stars and Stripes
drooping at the stern. This tableau ol
Frightfulness seems specially intended to
warn the Yanks of what will happen to any
liner that carries munitions for the Allies.
Also it serves to persuade its German audi-
ences that the sinking of munition cargoes
from ’Murka will bring the war to an end.
“Jwosp”: “Minim” (B. 26/10/’l6) is not
correct in stating that “.Jean Gilbert” is the
assumed name of the Austrian who did the
original score of “The Cinema Star.’
Gilbert originally was Scotch, with Scottish
parents, but some years ago he became an
artificial Hun because the English couldn’t
appreciate him. When the present war
broke out he was promptly heaved out
by his adopted brothers-in-art. Talking about
artificers and national mixtures, N’Yark is
gazing on a record-breaker now. This is
“Flora Bella,” an operetta. Felix Doermann
(Hun) did the original book and Charles
Gulliver (French) composed the score.
Milton Schwarzwald (Hun) wrote addi-
tional numbers, and Cosmo Hamilton
(British) fixed the pie up. Dorothy
Donnelly (Yank) ran a frill round the dish,
and Richard Ordyski (Pole) staged it, using
scenery painted by Joseph Urban (Austro-
IJun).
Alfred Frith, best remembered as the inane
life-saver of “So-Long, Letty,” and now toil-
ing humorously in “To-night’s the Night,
volunteered the other day, and will go into a
Light Horse camp at the end of the year.
He was in the S’African trouble as a heavy
dragoon, stayed in the regiment after peace
was declared, and filled in some of his many
spare hours with private theatricals the
great brain-saver of the resting army. Aus-
tralia’s old friend Bandmann happened to
visit the station with a co. that was tem-
porarily short of a comedian. Frith stepped
in as substitute and stayed in the grease-
paint. Now it’s time to saddle up again.
Actors are doing their bit in the war.
The English contingent alone exceeds -OUu.
As a result a late issue of the London
Eka —“the actors’ Bible” — un-
precedented appearance. For the 75 years
of its existence its front page has been mono-
polised by actors’ cards. But these cards
are now so scarce that two of the five
columns of this recent front page are occu-
pied with news matter. Before the war
many excellent actors had to wait a long
time for a place •on the front page. To be
there was a proof of having “arrived.” Now
to be there is proof that a man is too old
or decrepit to go any farther.
Seymour Hicks, who puts on a big new
musical play in February? tells his latest in-
terviewer: “I should like it known that all
wounded soldiers and their nurses will find
our theatre free and open to them at ail
times. They are welcome to keep money out
at this house whenever it is open. But for
what they have done for us, none of our
theatres would be open at all.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Bad Australian” turns out his pockets:
The embittered individual who invented the phrase
“filthy lucre” must have had Paraguayan treasure
on his mind. In this country, as in all South Ameri-
can communities, gold does not circulate, neither
does silver, nickel, or even brass, nowadays. This
jumpy nation is run on a shin-plaster basis, denomi-
nations ranging from 1000 dollars down to 50
centavos. There are even notes of less value than
50 centavos, but these don’t circulate much, thank
Heaven. The bills in common use are 50 cents, 1
dollar, and 2,6, 10, 20 and 50 dollars. The 50
cent and the 1- and 2-dollar bills are the filthiest
and altogether most dilapidated fragments you could
wish to throw into a dustbox. And they are as cheap
and uncertain as they look. The present value of the
Paraguayan dollar is less than lid. The only way
to save money is to spend it while it is worth any-
thing. Exchange jumps about like a demented devil,
at times varying several points in an hour or two.
Doing business or holding Paraguayan paper money
is just a gamble. You may win, but in
practice you generally lose. The only sure way is to
convert to gold as soon as you have enough to buy a
gold dollar or an English sovereign. The natural
consequence is that money is little used outside the
chief towns, the people preferring to swap a goat for
a monkey or a bunch of bananas for a setting of
blue devils in a cana bottle. In such primitive deals
you know where you are —or you think you do.
“Try Fluke”: Maoriland lancewood may
yet find a use in the making of violins. A
Westland man, accidentally discovering its
beautiful tone, made a fiddle of it and sent
it to an expert in Melbourne. The latter
pronounced the instrument to be as good as,
and if anything superior in tone to, his own
prized Cremona. Another of M.L.’s Great
National Assets, let me prophesy, will be the
cabbage-tree. Some day, when the C.S.R.
makes things too hot, we’ll get at the sac-
charine of this palm. Try it. Collect the
tree when it is joung—say when it is four
or five feet high—cut out the pithy inside,
dry it in the sun, cook it for 24 hours, then
scrape out the browny stuff from the wood.
You’ll find it a very decent sweetener.

As a nation we may be shortsighted, but
here and there circumstance discovers a
cautious cove who is looking ahead. The
flooded-out Victorians who live by the
Murray had to grin the other day when
they were handed an order for 200 tons of
chaff by an Echuca steamer-owner. It came
from the manager of Tarella station, in
Western N. S. Wales, and the bagged fodder,
when ready, was to go down the flooded
Murray and up the Darling towards Bourke,
then a hundred miles or so by bullock ex-
press to the station, there to be stored
against the next drought!
♦ * * *
“Deep”: The farmers on the plains in the
north-central part of Vic. can tell you some-
thing about the deep-ploughing fad. They
used to believe in it, because some foreign
“experts” said it was the right thing, and as
a result many had to get off their mortgage-
ridden farms. Now they fallow to a depth
of three or four inches and let the subsoil
religiously alone, and between them they can
muster a good flock of motor-cars.
* * * *
“M.R.”: Part of the hull of the Lady
Augusta, the first steamer to navigate the
Murray, is still visible, if you know where
to look for it, on the N. S. Wales side of the
Murray at Echuca, and her stem is on view
in the .Echuca Mechanics’ Institute. It was
in 1853 that Captain Cadell first piloted the
Lady Augusta up the Murray, and when she
wasn’t safe to pilot any more she was run
aground.

“Constant Reader, S.A.”: A writer in a
recent Bulletin said the huge haystack at
Riverton (S.A.) was larger than the one at
Gladstone. When measured for fire insurance
the stack at Gladstone was found to hold
1013 tons and that at Riverton 958 tons.
The Gladstone heap is the largest in South
Aus., whose stacks are usually easily the
largest in the Commonwealth.

The Gresham Hotel in Adelaide has been
bought by the 1.0.0. F., subject to an existing
lease; so that, if ever Prohibition arrives, a
Temple may go up on that unique site —
corner of North Terrace and King William-
street, the other corners being occupied by
Government House, Parliament House, and
the Bank of N. S. Wales.
It is disclosed that Farmers £30,000
for Roberts’s corner, Sydney, with 14 years
of the original lease to run at a ground lent
of £lBOO per year. As there is a frontage
to George-street of 34ft. 9in., the price
means £lOOO per foot.
“Powder Puff”: I felt sorry for the girl
in charge of the toilet rubbish at one ot the
big stores the other day. I went into tlio
great barn in search of sixpenn orth ot but-
tons and was appalled by the customers who
weren’t there —only miles of counters manned
by eager girls trying not to look idle under
the shopwalker’s eye. “Care to see a
demonstration Of face cream, madam.
pleaded a sweet young voice. Only three-
and-six a pot.” I remembered 14 immediate
uses I had for three-and-six and shook my
head. Before I could escape the nutty little
girl mentioned four other unnecessary pre-
parations, all of them mere scented excuses
for spending three-and-six —or four-and-six.
She almost wept when I passed to get the
buttons I wanted for the small son’s blouse.
I hope the poor little thing gets out of the
fading skin-lunch department into the plain,
necessary buttons before that establishment
starts to shorten hands.

have turned the Germans out of. The valu-
able wharf site on the west side of Circular
Quay, for many years leased by Sydney
Harbor Trust to the Nord Deutscher Lloyd
co., is now placarded with the name of
Nippon Yusen Ivaisha. N.Y.K.’s pre-war
berth on the eastern side of the Quay is
not sufficient to accommodate the enor-
mously-increased Japanese trade that has
grown up by a combination of the Hun and
the shiftless Australian, who can’t make
clothes-pegs for the missus nor a jumping-
jack for the kids. Incidentally the Jap. has
come to an understanding with the E. and
A. Co., and the two cut up the trade beyond
Singapore in perfect amity.

“Wart”: The transport Queen, stink dur-
ing the recent Hunnish raid on the English
Channel service, was sister to the Melbourne-
Launceston trader Loongana. The Loon-
gana, built on the Queen model, was the
first turbine ship to come south of the line.
Although she has been ferrying about 12
years her 22-23 knots is still about the best
streak of smoke Tasmania knows.

A farmer near Echuca (Vic.) pulled down
the other day an old red-gum fence put up
70 years ago. He found that except for an
inch or so on the outside the underground
parts of the posts were as sound as the day
they were put in.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: He’s an old resident of the
Bathurst (N.S.W.) district, and during
midwinter he wrote to the newsagent, “I
want you to stop my paper, as I have no
call for it just now.” Later, the agent
asked him the reason. “Well.” said Burr,
“the kids are having their holidays and we
don’t Have any iunca to wrap up. ’

“Glen H.”: A disturbed conscience rarely
yields a Treasurer more than 4s. Sid. in one
lump, but the Victorian Government has
just received £2OO in notes with the intima-
tion : “For conscience sake.” It is one of
the most expensive articles of the kind ever
discovered in these parts.
• * * *
“Copabella”: A cable report mentions that
British prisoners in Germany were beaten
with “besoms.” I have never seen the word
used in Australia before, though it was
familiar enough all over Worcestershire
(Eng.). A besom —generally pronounced
“bizzum” —is a broom made by binding twigs,
preferably birch ones, round a bush-cut
broomstick. All up and down the Australian
coast you’ll see gardeners using a similar tool
made out of tea-tree cuttings. They
don’t call them besoms, though. Australia,
though quick to coin words and phrases for
the general, is slow in adopting names for
the particular. But I guess Australia would
find a library of names for the tool if it
were used as an instrument of torture.

Some signboards in Tokyo:—
A tailor’s: “Respectable ladies and gentlemen may
step in here and have all kinds of fits.” A fish-seller’s:
“Whale, and all relating to, sold here.” A barber’s:
“Cut off the head.” A baker’s: “Bread maid in
manufacturer.” A small all-sorts shop: “General
wigs and dancing utensils.” Another barber’s: “Hair
cutter for dogs.” A curio-dealer: “All kind of
antics.” A varnish manufacturer: “This is not
manufactures of the shop, that this mark uhpaste
over. I desire the trouble to buy no attending all
marks of the upper line.” Finally, a stationer
issues a circular: “The Pen-dag Fountain Den could
satisfy the-wont that Convenient, Profitadle, Economi-
cal, Practical, Noble, which are the requirment of
civilised day; and it is awefully convenient at any
time, in a journey, in the office and its convenient in
not compared with an ordinal pen. This noble and
line Pen dog Pen not only spares title time but-will
decorate the table. Those wholhave not experience
of using of Pen can easiiy write on paper in very
beautiful styl and find out the peculiar superioirty.”

An old trade-route, long closed by Inter-
State jealousy, has just been reopened in
the far south-west of Victoria. Vic. and
S.A. recently got friendly enough to run a
railway from Portland to the Mt. Gambier
district, and the other day the first ship-
ment of (35 bales of wool went over the
line. It is about 60 years since the last
South Australian fleece was carted from
Portland to be shipped there. When the
Mt. Gambier line is in full swing and the
now more or less suspended direct line from
Portland through Hamilton to Horsham and
the Wimmera is opened, Portland may wake
up a little.

WHEN MOTHER HAS A POUND TO SPEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When mother has a pound to spend
It makes us grin to see
Her offerin’ ol’ Dad to lend
Him half if only he
Will put her fowlhouse in repair,
“An’ do it, mind, without a swear!”
Dad jibs, of course, an’ Mum will go,
Intent to buy a gown,
Where we are pretty sure they’ll show
Her goods to take her down.
Then she comes home so proud to show
How far she made her money go!
There’ll be a pair o’ pants for Dad,
An’ denims, too, for Clem
(An’ jus’ to show how Mum’s been had
They’re miles too small for them).
Ribbons for us will drain her pelf—
And ne'er a button for herself!
She’ll tell us how she nicely caught
The trader on the hop ;
Though she has purchased next to naught—
She’s handled all the shop,
An’ from the bargainin’ she’s done
She’s had a tenner’s worth o’ fun!
When mother has a pound to melt
She and her money part
Good friends—few neighbors haven’t felt
The bigness of her heart.
For ’tis like Mum’s dear self to spend
It on her household or a friend!
VI UTOIiIA.

A PUBLIC DANGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A French bacteriologist has found 200,000,000,(KM)
germs on a single pound-note.
I have not got a single pound,
Despite my arduous labor,
But pompous, large and very round
Old Croesus is, my neighbor.
So rich is he the State should set
’Tween us a blue-stone barrier —•
What fell diseases one may get
From this confirmed ' germ-carrier !

ACTING IN THE STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wing is a man I hate to meet;
He can’t help acting in the street.
He frowns and struts before the town
And works his eyebrows up and down.
He thumps his chest, his stage-voice clear
Attracts all groundlings ling’ring near.
Folk think him strange —and they are right!
But, when they pay to watch at night,
They think, with minds made dark and dim,
That he’s like Life and Life’s like him 1
Which shows, when sizing up a star,
What rotten critics people are.
Wing is a man I hate to meet;
He can’t stop acting in the street.

It won’t scratch the enamel
Don’t use ordinary scouring soap
or scouring powder on a nice
enamel bath tub or you will
surely scratch the enamel and
make it rough and worn.
Use Bon Ami. This is a mineral
soap that is softer and finer than
scouring soap. It is just the
thing for white enamel. It cleans
it beautifully but does not
scratch.
You don’t know how white
and shining your tub can be till
you try Bon Ami on it.
Also for windows and mirrors,
and for use as a metal polish.
At your grocers.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Of course. Down at Junee Cff.S.W.) an
inspired alderman has moved “that the Gov-
ernment be asked to extend the life of
municipal councils for six months after the
war.” And why not? How can the Govern-
ment justify a refusal?
Sixty life-passes over Australian railways
have been handed out by the Commonwealth
—to all ex-Federal Ministers, Speakers of
the two Houses and so on. The handing
out appears to have been the last official
act of the O’Malley. Why the taxpayers
of Australia should be made to pay for
dragging this crowd of Tite Barnacles about
in railway trains for the rest of their lives
is not explained; and that perhaps is just
as well, since any explanation which de-
scribed the transaction as anything else than
a scandal would miss the bull’s-eye. The
Bulletin is now waiting to hear how many
of the men who have received these tokens
of political degeneracy are decent enough to
decline them.
ART IS LONG.
MODEL: “Hello, Dad! Smoking a cigar, eh
—sold a picture?”
ARTIST : “No, dear girl—my overcoat.”
Two classics: (Written) “From Log
Cabin to White House.” (To be published
shortly in N. S. Wales) “From Leg Show to
Leg. Council,” by Hugh D. Mclntosh.
Dear Bulletin.— l want your assistance.
I came to Sydney under engagement to a
commercial house for three years. Recently
my boss has been very agitated over the
war and other things, and while in this dis-
turbed state of mind he intimated that he
didn’t think much of me, and I am afraid
he does not intend to renew my contract. I
have done nothing that he could possibly
take exception to, except run him heavily
into debt and quarrel with the other em-
ployees. To assert my rights I had to punch
one of them on the nose the other evening.
Do you think I would have any difficulty in
getting a bill through Parliament compelling
my employer to engage me for another 12
months at least whether he wants me or
not? I feel sure that Mr. Holman and Mr.
Wade will help me. Can I rely on your
assistance, too?—Yours faithfully, Edward
(Ned) Kelly.
The scandalous exemption which leaves the
Fatman’s Adelaide Club outside the six-
o’clock closing clauses of the S. Aus. Licens-
ing Act has been continued. The end of the
Parliamentary session saw last year’s scene
repeated. The Leg. Council then ran in an
amendment expressly exempting the Club.
This year it struck out a section taking away
that privilege. In each case it was so
determined that the Assembly, to get the rest
of an important Bill through at all. had to
give way. Next time perhaps the Vaughan
Government will not put the amendment of
this scandalous provision in an “important
Bill.” If it does it ought to know what con-
clusion will be drawn.
Some day, when a Government tainted
with I.W.W. theories gets into power, a sec-
tion of the public will bubble in wild indigna-
tion, and there will be anguished meetings
throughout the country and perhaps talk of
revolution. Then the Government which is
busy carrying I.W.W. theories into effect
will point to the meetings and the talk of
revolution and the general state of unrest as
a reason why there shouldn’t be a general
election for three years; and it will quote
the present action of the Ilolwade Govern-
ment as a precedent. And what will the
Liberals and Conservatives be able to say
in reply?
A new idea will be tried at the next Mel-
bourne General Sessions. Instead of the
prisoners being rudely bundled into the
dock and sat upon by a jury and sentenced
by a Judge whether they are agreeable or
not, they are to be asked to take a vote
as to whether they- approve of the respective
laws under which they stand charged. If
they vote “Yes” the trial will proceed; if
they vote “No” they will be allowed to go
and fight it out with society. It is a bril-
liant scheme, and was evolved by Hughes
when dealing last week with the coal-miners
who had broken and defied the law against
striking. At any rate, if the plan isn’t
adopted with regard to the prisoners at
the Sessions they will have every right to
assume that the distinction is made be-
cause there are 20 of them and 5000 of
the others.
The N. S. Wales Assembly had wrestled
for 12 hours with a Lighting Bill, and when
everyone was broken winded the Bill to
disfranchise the electors for 12 months was
rushed forward—it was then 4.30 a.m.—
and jambed through all its stages. The
operation consumed 13 hours of rancor. The
Grabbers had a majority and went blindly
on like a herd of elephants dashing through a
Sunday-school picnic. If the I.W.W.
acquired a majority in Parliament and did
a thing like this, every Fat interest in the
country would blow a hole in the heavens
ft with its yells of horrified protest.
The South Aus. Assembly nearly lost its
Sunday-school certificate in the heated hours
of a midnight sitting that ended the season’s
talk- At least one member went “outside”
significantly, after flinging an invitation to
his enemy to follow him, and much abusive
language was hurled. The othpr member was
hung on to and soothed into not going. So
the excommunicated Vaughan Government
got to recess without the fracture of bones;
also, without anything definite being done to
clean up the scandal in connection with the
Glenelg “harbor” contract.
A conference of Commonwealth post-
masters in Melbourne recently decided that
their offices ought to be closed altogether on
Saturdays because of the small amount of
business done on that day. It seems a fair
thing; but why stop at Saturday? The other
days of the week are just as fatiguing.
Some people are born modest, and it was
like that perhaps with a deputation which
lately waited on the Victorian Minister of
Health. The Malvern Council having made
a _ start at abolishing slums by fixing the
minimum for a building allotment at 50ft. x
100 ft., with not more than a quarter the
area to be built on, various builders, house-
agents and architects promptly called on
Hagelthorn and urged him to “review” the
Council’s regulations with an axe. The Min-
ister didn’t seem impressed, though he pro-
mised . to talk it over with the Malvern
Council. He seemed to be looking about for
the fourth party interested in the subdivi-
sional sale industry—the also-modest and
invisible landowner.
“Mujik” unfolds the tragedy of Jaugher:
He was a good chap, who was cultivating the
woman vote assiduously, and “ladies’ committees”
had been formed all over the place. Jaugher and I
(I was his trainer) lived in an atmosphere of femi-
nine adoration that drove the other candidate to
frantic libels, which we exposed with great indigna-
tion and joy. A week before the poll we were
timed to pay a return visit to the principal town
in the electorate. Out in the wilds we had received
a letter from the Mayor’s wife asking if we wanted
any flags hung in the hall. Of course Jaugher sent
an urgent telegram in reply. And this is what the
dear old girl got delivered to her: “Hope to see every
hag in the town suspended from the roof.—Jaugher.”
It was no good. We arrived to find a vast silence—•
no mayor, no flags, no girls; only a meeting for the
opposition man wildly cheering the roof off.
DISHONORED.
On the I3th inst. a Westralian book-
maker, one of a deputation which prostrated
itself before Premier Wilson and begged him
not to shut down on the Ikeys of that State,
declared that the determination of Ministers
“would kill the goose that was laying the
golden eggs.” Less than 48 hours previ-
ously the “place tote” at Belmont Park had
paid a divvy of £7B for 10s. gambled by a
solitary investor on Lady A.B. in the Sec-
ond Class Plate. There were 20 starters,
and _ no tote-patron backed the winner
straight out. The best laying effort of
Moses O’Goose was a miserable 20 to 1
against the winner—which is to say 5 to 1
for a place, no less! It is hardly surprising
that the penciller gets gooseflesh at the idea
of being pushed off such toothsome pasture.
WEDDED.
There are still a few self-reliant persons
game to defy Parliamentary instructions.
Hence the new cool stores at Burwood
(Vic.) —State owned —are to be built mostly
of Norwegian white deal instead of Tas-
manian blue-gum or messmate. The previous
stores were burned down; and as the im-
ported material is most inflammable the
authorities probably want to discover, by
further experiment, whether the first flare-
up wasn’t really a much slower business
than it should have been.
The charge of the Anzacs at Pozieres was
a flutter of butterflies compared with the
rush of place-hunters in search of appoint-
ment to the N.S.W. Leg. Council. Four
hundred applications have so far been re-
ceived, many of them from people who have
sworn that the Leg. Council shouldn’t be
permtted to exist another week.
Bendigo was caught on the cadge the other
day. When the goldfield City Council and
the Chamber of Commerce held out the bell-
topper for a new set of public offices to cost
£9OOO, the frock-coated petitioners forgot
that the city, in common with the rest of
Victoria, had just been howling at the
harassed Peacock Government to economise.
But the Minister of Public Works remem-
bered, and dropped the brick of scorn through
the belltopper.
The loafers on Labor have been hand-fed
so long on loans that they can’t imagine life
without them. At a recent meeting in
Sydney Town Hall, Stuart Robertson, of
N.S.W. Assembly, savagely forecasted the
stoppage of the Holman Government’s
mad construction programme, and then
cheerfully debited it in advance to spiteful
conscriptionists. It is a fine demonstration
of how to manufacture a hard-baked griev-
ance out of hot air.
Ex-Minister for Lands George Beeby, who
has been put into the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment, managed splendidly. He was not
even a member of Parliament. He was the
Progressive Party and spent much time
rushing about the country explaining that
the Progressives were a great institution.
On October 31 he violently denounced the
projected coalition and the prolongation of
Parliament. To the Progressive party the
whole business was then damnable. This
is the way George Beeby squeaked in the
Telegraph of that date: —
It is apparent that taking advantage of a state of
panic an attempt is being made to extend the life
of Parliament. , . .for the sole purpose of saving the
political skins of these people.... Nothing is more
dangerous to any country than a sudden deprivation
of the people’s rights.... It is unjustifiable.
And so on. On November 2 Beeby issued a
proclamation in which the Progressive Party
yelled: “We demand inclusion in the Cabi-
net.” On November 3 he camped at the
pantry door yowling for a bone —any old
bone. And he did it so persistently that at
last he was pushed into the Upper House
with a bone and a wide smile, babbling about
the “necessity for having a strong Govern-
ment.” A few remarks about a strong smell
would have been as appropriate.
THE STATE OF SYDNEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ah, me! I spied about my palace gate,
A goodly harbor filled with ships of state
That groaned with merchandise from East and
West;
Freighted with gold arid many a comely chest
Of wine and fragrant silk. Such argosies
Had brought the wealth of earth to Sydney seas. ...
And then I woke. 0 fill my glass again!
Sydney was snivelling in the drizzling rain,
And empty-bunkered slept her sillj' ships,
While Kultur laughed, smacking his leprous lips.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The result of the two-year-old race at
Caulfield last Saturday kept the folks on the Plat
cheering and jeering for five minutes. The flatites
get a more correct view of a tight finish than the
bunched-up crowd behind the judge’s box. Anttoil
made all the running, but 20 yards from home there
were three other youngsters almost level with the
pacemaker. The finish was a conflict of shouts. The
judge decided that Stagefright (stable companion of
Quillion, the favorite) had won by half a head from
Allyerra, with Haud half a head further back, and
Anttoil just beaten out of a place. A lot of un-
official judges reckoned that Anttoil actually won. or
Allyerra, or Haud. Anyhow, the crowd on the far
side of the course jeered at the victory of the ugly
outsider, who carried a little public money because
little Dempsey was up. Whether the noise was
directed against the judge or the stable that had won
with the wrong horse was not at all clear. To have
pleased everybody the judge should have given it a
deadheat between four.
* * * K-
One of the oldest habitues of the saddling-
paddock at Flemington says he never thought to see
the day when horses would be walked round mud-
heaps in the classic enclosure. A chain of mountains
of silt from the Saltwater River runs along the centre
of the birdcage. Between the floods and Derby Day
there was no time for getting the silt away. It
had to be swept into the middle of the lowlands and
piled pyramid]callv. The black stuff cannot be used
as top-dressing for lawns \because it refuses to mingle
with ordinary soil), but presumably it will be good
food for V.R.C. vegetation when the moisture has
dried out of it.
* * * *
At Melbourne last week 700 guineas was
handed over for the Comedy King colt Court Jester.
He cost 400 guineas as a yearling, and is still a
maiden. He showed moderate form at Randwick last
month, and with the lightweight Foley (6st. 101 b.)
aboard was backed down to 9 to 2 for the Williams-
town Cup. He got off well but failed to do any
good. Better horses have been sold for less.
* * * *
Notwithstanding the slowness of the
V.R.C. Oaks race, which was 81 sec. over the record,
it proved a fair test of staying power in the three
starters. As a matter of fact, the Oaks was the
most interesting race of a damp day. Thana wasted
only a little time before getting away with a strong
lead, and she stayed in front until the short-winded
Ettefred and Boontree made their efforts when
turning into the straight. It seemed for a moment
that they had collared the leader, whereas Shanahan
was holding the N. S. Wales filly in reserve for a
final run. At the distance Thana went ahead again,
whilst Ettefred dropped back three lengths behind
Boontree.
*_ * * *
English horses won a lot of money for
the books on Oaks Day at Flemington. In the Lin-
lithgow Stakes two of the six runners—Lavendo and
Cyklon—were imported lights that failed, and
Lavendo was heavily backed. In the next race Green
Cap, Allegory, Quinologist, Lady Blacksand and
Windlesham were English nags that didn’t win.
And in the last race of the day, the Veteran Stakes,
four of the 10 losers came from England. Much
coin, or rather many notes, were dropped into the
bags on account of Torbane, Canzone and Half-a-
Glass, not to mention Honorious. Evidently there
is no fortune to be made by backing the eccentric
foreigners when “English weather” conditions pre-
vail. The rule of uncertainty is the only rule that
holds good with English horses. There was plenty
of dirt and rain about on Oaks Day as on Derby Day,'
nevertheless the form of Lavendo and Torbane
changed greatly for the Canzone, to be sure,
was only a nominal starter for the Veteran Stakes.
The field had hardly left the barrier when there
was a bit of a scrimmage, and the backers of Canzone
were grieved to see its jockey sprawling on the
ground.
* * * *
Half-a-Glass, from the Cold Country, has
given the stable something to drink at last. Prior
to landing the V.A.T.C. Armadale Cup, a mile and
three furlongs, on Saturday, the nag with the short-
measure name had been a failure in these parts,
although several events fell to him in England.
He ran well in the Veteran Stakes at Flemington on
the third day of the V.R.C. meeting, and is expected
to have something to say about the V.R.C. Handi-
cap, a mile and three-quarters, next Saturday. The
pommy struggled past the post half a head in front
of Dame Quickly on Saturday at the comforting
price of 7 to 1 against. Dame Quickly hasn’t done
much since she won the Maiden Handicap at Flem-
ington a year ago, when she downed Lingle, Vibra-
tory, Football, Lady Tressady, Comedia and others, all
of which have since contributed more or less towards
their feed. Her conqueror of Saturday was at one
time trained at Randwick by Billy Kelso.
* * * *
The V.R.C. meeting will not be disposed of
until Saturday, two weeks later than the appointed
time. Moreover, the date of the much postponed
fixture is still subject to the vagaries of the beastly
weather. Given a fair go under test conditions the
trusty Carlita should prove a trifle too good for
Wolaroi in the C. B. Fisher Plate, and Rendrock
may, bar accident, beat a very second-rate field in
the Steeple. Time has been when sports protested
that racing over the big sticks was dangerous in
November on account of the hard ground, but this
year the objection has resolved itself into' a joke.
* * * '*
It is in the flat races that punters’ hopes
come an early cropper these times. Canzone, who
seemed to have a good chance of scoring a win
at last in the Veteran Stakes at Flemington on Oaks
Day, stumbled and dropped his jockey almost as soon
as he got away from the barrier. There were only
11 runners, and the second favorite was practically
down before they got going. It might as well have
been a steeplechase. A worse mishap befell many
backers at Caulfield last Saturday, when a field of
12 was jostling for the Armadale Cup. The much-
fancied Aurifer fell, but the jockey was more in-
jured than the horse. And the more fancied Vibra-
tory fell over Aurifer. Imported Half-a-Glass had
the luck to win by half a head from Dame Quicklv.
Another 50 yards to go and the mare would have
caught him.
Visiting owners have expressed themselves
strongly about their suspicions of dishonest riding
at Melbourne’s racing carnival. It is not a jockey
ring so much as a jockey king that they complain
of. The money of one gambling tactician or other
appears to talk to a number of the boys who are
supposed to take instructions from the owner, but
are mostly prepared to take him down. The red-
hot favoritism of certain horses that carry certain
people’s big commission would be inexplicable in
many cases save the assumption that the favorite’s
most dangerous looking opponents have been dead-
ened by the boss conspirator. Visiting owners
maintain that racing is more honest at Randwiek,
where this particular evil is not established. They
wonder whether the stewards who watch the game
of corruption with half-closed eyes will ever call
a secret session of trainers and bookmakers to dis-
cuss the situation. The tote must, in due course,
take a lot of gilt off the schemers’ gingerbread. But
in the meantime there is a betting market to be
exploited, and a host of small punters to get all the
worst of it even when they back the fraudulently good
thing.
* * * *
What this page has not yet heard is some
rational explanation from the people who tipped
Wallace Isinglass to win the Melbourne Cup or
those who put their cash on the animal. Here is a
moke that has been a calamity to punters for two
seasons ; vet at Randwiek he was backed, and again
at Flemington. Time after time he has run like a
mule, and yet there are newspapers which incited the
public to think he would win over two miles with
Bst. 71b. in the saddle—and this in a race which
has. gone to lighter-weighted nags every time ex-
cept four since Carbine’s year. For Wallace Isin-
glass to have won he would need to be a great
racehorse, • What reason was there for thinking him
anything like one? There are a dozen reasons for
being dead certain he isn’t. There are horses which
no one except a millionaire can afford to back, and
V allace Isinglass is one of them, as this page
pointed out long ago.

Died in Melbourne, last week, Carlisle
Studholine, owner of Silent Way and the ’chaser
New York, which he sent across from Maoriland, for
the Spring meetings at Randwiek and Flemington.
Studholme hailed from South Canterbury, where the
old, original Studholme settled in the long ago and
bred sheep on wide pastures south of the I’areora
River. He was an enthusiast at hunting—a sport
that was bred in the bones of the first crop of well-
to-do youngsters in that part of the world ; for at the
beginning of things Englishmen drifted along with
cash and a profound yearning to ride behind dogs.
It was fine 'untin’-counfry, too, till the wire-fence
became fashionable. Pneumonia stopped this good
sportsman at 46.
THEO MARKS , of
Sydney , one of the
pluckiest punters in
Australia.
Even if the tote arrives and something
hits a lot of the wretched little meetings that flourish
around Sydney there will still be a chance for Mac-
Shortodds to earn an honest brown. The man who
made a book on the daily strike and a double on this
and the next would introduce a gamble for which the
community has long' been panting. A list of odds
on offer from day to day against the piano-shifters
or window-cleaners or bank-managers going on strike
within seven days would be a popular item, and if
the bacon-curers went out the price on offer against
them returning to toil could be taken by the man
with inside information up to the last bob at his
command. All this would invest the industrial activi-
ties of the State with an importance at least equal to
the general interest taken in the imported pony Pul-
lisedoff. Just consider the excitement there would
be if the barbers downed their razors, and there was
opportunity to gamble on how long Premier Holman’s
whiskers would grow before he could get them pub-
licly removed. Holman ought to see to it. The tax
on betting-tickets would help a bit.

A big starting-price coup came undone re-
cently in Sydney. A pony man reckoned he had a
certainty, but knew that the slightest move to back
the nag on the course would lead to 758 punters
being mangled in the rush to invest. In order to
avert a catastrophe the considerate owner resolved
to back his good thing at starting price. An order
w as sent to Melbourne to place £lOO at s.p. on the
day of the race, and the Sydney end of the transac-
tion was left until such a late hour that it was
impossible for the books to send covering money out
to the course. The owner shook hands with himself
when he heard 25 to 1 called against his unbeatable
animal, and selected a secluded spot in the stand to
enjoy the fruits of his deep-laid scheme. Up went
the barrier, and away went every nag in the race
in front of the bottled-up article. ' That’s how it was
all the way. The owner is slowly recovering from
the shock.

.Jockey Bracken had a brain-wave when he
resolved to ride at the Queensland Cup Meeting
instead of at the more alluring V.R.C. Spring Car-
nival. Altogether he steered six winners. On Satur-
day he was aboard the imported Chantemerle, which
annexed the big event of the day, the Sandgate
Handicap, and he was on Lieutenant Linacre, winner
of the two-year-old event. Among Bracken’s other
successes at the meeting were wins on the Sydney-
siders Cagou and Baltic Sea, each of which was
stripped once. Bracken is one of the best boys in
the game and keeps his winning percentage higner
than recognised top-notchers.
One of the speediest trotters N. S. Wales
has known has come to town. Globe Derby, starting
from the lOOyds.-behind mark, went out at 6 to 4
on at Victoria Park (Sydney) on Saturday, spread-
eagled everything in the Flying Handicap, and shat-
tered the mile record for the course by getting over
the distance in 2min. 13sec. This streaker is a six-
year-old stallion by Mambrino Derby—Springheel, and
will have to start from outside the course fence in
future if any other moke is to get a chance.
“W. McK. M.” : About that paragraph (B.
9/X1 /’ 16) relating to old sports who “still argue,
with some force, that the starting machine is
faulty in so far that it cannot recall the field,
when two or three horses are badly left.” This de-
fect has been completely overcome by one Will
Wallace, who starts all races hereabouts (Broken
Hill). He has a patent, in the form of a minia-
ture gun, that can be fixed to any old brand of
barrier in a few seconds, and it renders false starts
impossible. The device is clamped to a running
rail 20ft. or 30ft. behind the starting line, with
a wire bridle fixed to the trigger, and a tension
spring fore and aft, connected with the lever of the
barrier by wire. The action of the starter in turning
a key or pressing a lever (whichever is used) simul-
taneously releases the barrier and fires the gun.
The report announces a correct start. Instructions
to jockeys are: “No gun, no go.” Boys in trying
to anticipate the starter may break through, but
the gun is never affected until the start has been
duly made. After a year’s trial, this invention is
so pronounced a success that it is sure to be in
use on metropolitan courses before long.
“Buttons”: Mention of the death of John
L. Saqui recalls that he took £lOO to a sovereign
that Benson, the Jubilee plunger, would fall off a
horse he rode in an amateur race at Flemington
before he got back to the paddock. Saqui won the
bet. The juggins fell off when pulling his mount up.
That night, at the old Masonic Club, Benson asked
Saqui if the story about the bet was true. Saqui
said it was. “I thought you were a friend of mine,”
said the Plunger. “I’m a pound better friend now,”
was all the satisfaction he got out of Saqui.
Will they do the same in N. S. Wales? At
the S. Aus. Tattersall’s meeting on Saturday the
amusement tax was put into action for the first time.
The public did not suffer on this occasion, as the
Club undertook to disgorge the amount of the levy.
Are the shareholders in proprietary clubs round
about Sydney listening?

“Trot” : You can say what you like about
Darcy, but the monotony of fighting Jimmy Clabby
and Dave Smith for a living must have been pretty
trying to a youth of his age.

There were unprecedented happenings at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. Fred Kay
outed the other chap. He never did this very often
before and can tie relied upon not to do it too
frequently in future. But Kay behind a pair of
gloves is a horribly awkward proposition, and Art
Magirl (U.S.A.), who was handed the count, made
as poor a fist of dealing with the long Westralian
as any self-respecting amateur might be guilty of.
Magirl is not a very persistent battler, and after Kay
had downed him for nine in the third round, did
rather worse than before. There was something more
than a suspicion that, he would not have burst out
crying if he had lost on a foul. Anyhow, Arthur
Scott had to take notice two or three times and
issue several Notes on the' subject. The end came
in the seventh. Magirl took it. on the solar plexus
—a straight , drive from Kay’s left. There were
incredulous murmurs, but the Yank got it right
enough. Kay has broken up more pug- reputations
than any other Australian. If he could only
educate that left of liis to become a quick, habitual
puncher he might clean up everything in sight.
* * * -X-
After Magirl had twice defeated Dave
Smith there was some talk about the Yarik being
likely to make a good scrap of it with Darcy.
After his conflict with Kay the discussion was
adjourned, mainly because Darey is over the hori-
zon and Magirl’s reputation had collapsed. A win
over David is not what it might have been once.

Bat Masterson, a Yankee writer on sport,
hands Les Darcy a nasty one. He makes up a fanci-
ful but suggestive handicap for a “Spendthrift
Stakes,” and puts the Australian topweight with
Harry Lauder. Rightly or wrongly—probably be-
cause he once refused to be “touched” for a loan
by a cadging U.S.A. journalist—Lauder’s name is a
by-word for stinginess in that country’s press; so
Masterton’s offer of 10 to 1, bar these two, means
a lot. Who gave Darcy that sort of reputation over
there ?

Died last week, in Sydney, J. J. Davis,
sporting writer, cricket enthusiast, good companion
and white man. For years he helped to look after
the sporting news of the S. M. Herald ; and when
The Bulletin fell into cricket statistics it was
generally Davis that pushed it.
J. S. Taylor, of Western Suburbs, one of
the most promising all-round players in Sydney
grade cricket, is early in form. In the last round
against Middle Harbor he scored 109 runs and took
six wickets for 96 runs, Last season he scored
three centuries and headed the Westerners’ batting
and bowling averages.

Petersham (Sydney) wicket-keeper Quiney
captured the scalps of four ’Varsity batsmen on
Saturday—one caught and three stumped. Although
new to first-grade cricket Quiney is justifying the
promotion. In the same match the ’Varsity captain
was clean bowled by Jack Scott in both innings for
nil. The most surprised people were the batsman
and the bowler.

Melbourne public-school cricket provided a
mild sensation last week when a Xavier College
lad, Keith O’Neill, took Seven wielcets for nine run-
in a match against Geelong College.

“Dally” Messenger, the N. S. Wales foot-
ball idol in the days when only football mattered, has
turned from beer to bananas. He leaves Ins Sydney
pub this week and goes to Bananaland to make ni£
fortune by growing fruit sausages on 132 acres, neai
Nambour, far from the spectre of Early Closing.
Eastway’s, in George-street, where the
Sydney fisherman buys his gear, sold no hooks one
day last week, the wire shutters being up for Richaia
E. Eastway, fisherman, naturalist, patriot and
good clubman, who had passed at 52. When
“Eastway Brothers” stood on part of the land now
occupied by Lassetter’s, R.E. played junior to his
father and uncle, the then heads of the firm. len
years ago the firm moved north along George-street
and pasted a blue-pencilled notice on the window tor
the information of sports whenever a tug was going
out to the schnapper-grounds, But it was a black-
rimmed card last week.

There was always a full house for the
Gray-Lindrum billiard-match in Melbourne, although
it had no appearance of deadly earnestness. People
accepted it as a fair display of the best that the
young men can do without making heavy demands
on the monotonous Gray stroke. The everlasting
losing hazard makes a heavy demand on an audi-
ence’s patience, and unless there is a genuine gam-
bling interest in the contest the public prefers an
exhibition game. Everyone takes it for granted
that Gray can beat Fred Lindrum at the red hazard
play, but there is a doubt on the subject. As a
tactician and a top-of-the-table artist Lindrum is
still the better of the two. At times he makes
George Gray look small.

The success of Lindsay Todd and E. Hicks
in the Sydney Club’s doubles tennis championship
put new names on the roster. W. Clark and G. W T .
Wright were the opponents in the final ; but the
younger players had no great difficulty in winning
the title. Clark has been unfortunate in the season’s
championship#. He ran into the final of both singles
and doubles, but an accident cut him out of the
singles, and youth prevailed against him in the
doubles. Clark’s partner, Wright, is also an old
campaigner. He previously won the doubles cham-
pionship for three years with Sharp, and also with
A. B. Jones, and has at different times won the
championship of many Australian States.
Another Australian motor-cycle record
blew off the books when the Westralian R. Wigmore,
with side-car attached, reeled off a half-mile recently
in 31 2-ssec., thereby cutting 2 2-ssee. off the
previous best. The man who has to keep tab of all
these records is being worked to death.
In its battle with the ponies the A.J.C.
finds that the Law, like Providence, fights with the
biggest battalions. In order to spike some of the
guns of the “unregistered” clubs, the A.J.C. com-
mittee pronounced that no bookie with a “horse”
license should bet at a pony meeting on any day
a horse meeting was run. One Robinson did this
thing and was expelled from Randwick. He put a
test case before the Full Court, which really turned
on whether A.J.C. by-law 15 is valid. This by-law
reserves to the committee power at its absolute dis-
cretion to revoke any Ikey’s registration. The Court
has now held this by-law good at law, thereby
placing I. Noses where he ought to be. Obviously
the Club had nothing against Robinson, who can no
doubt make his peace with the committee, but the
decision gives the A.J.C. a big .pull. The ponies
cannot compete against a horse meeting unless they
can guarantee a supply of Ikes who are independent
of the big clubs—and that is a steep proposition.

“The Lad”: The Australians are well
looked after in the Old Dart. On arriving in Eng-
land every inan is allowed four days’ leave to go
to London. On my first visit I was rather dis-
appointed. First impressions, were of a smoky old
city trying to hide behind advertisement hoardings.
However, after seeing a few stables, the Tower, St.
Paul’s and Westminster Abbey I was greatly com-
forted. We are right in the boom. The rate of
pay for all ranks is a never-ending wonder to the
English, partly on account of the way Anzac throws
his cash about when he goes to an occasional race-
meeting. Glance at the largest, flashest taxi sweep-
ing down the Strand ; it’s a 50 to 1 bet that it is
carrying h Billjim who is holding the hand of a
tender,- limpid-eyed maiden. Walk into the best
hotels and you will see - brother Bluegimds name
large on the visitors’-book. At the theatre, in the
box next to one occupied by Col. Lyddite, you will
observe the grin of old Bill and the this-theatre-
belongs-to-me look of his Gills —and, of course, the
usual “friend.” And at the swell cafes, also, you can
mark Ginger Mick’s pals treating long-haired
“cousins” to fizz, and in France —well, don’t ask me.
Come and have a look at it.

“S.A.” : I’m satisfied that “The Reefer’s”
experience (B. 2/11/’l6) of the deafening roar follow-
ing his method of extracting a cleaning rag from a
.303 carbine is unusual. I’ve observed about 30 cases
of rifles being blocked by the pull-through and rag
jambing in the bore, and in every case “The
Reefer’s” method, i.e., load up and let fly, was both
harmless and effective. To anyone accustomed to a
rifle there is only the faintest suggestion of a jar,
and everyone at the Front in the predicament referred
to invariably resorts to the method when the
armorer-sergeant, with his antediluvian ramrod and
prehistoric notions of preserving the casing, is not
hovering about.

Chas. William Cayser, an English baronet
recently deceased, was one of England’s best-
known “sea lawyers.” He was head of the
Clan Line, running to Asiatic ports, and
immortalised by the fight the Clan McTavisb
put up against the German cruiser Moewe
in the Atlantic last year. Cayser sat in
the House of Commons for some time, and
was the gramophone of the British ship-
owner. Two of his daughters married
admirals—Jellicoe and his Chief of Staff.

THE. SECRET OF A
GOOD COMPLEXION.
By MME. ST. CLAIRE.
Any woman nowadays may quickly reju-
venate her complexion at home by a safe and
painless process of gentle absorption. The
days of expensive and dangerous “operations”
are past, and each woman ean be her own
bqauty doctor. It has been discovered that
ordinary mercolised wax, applied like cold
cream, at night, will cause the thin veil of
lifeless, sallow or blotchy cuticle to gradually
and gently flake off in invisible, flour-like
particles, revealing the fresh, vigorous and
beautiful young skin underneath. Mercolised
wax absorbs only the unhealthy and un-
sightly outer film, and does not affect the
healthy tissue at all.
The process defies detection, and unveils
a lasting and beautiful complexion, which is,
of course, a perfectly natural one. For this
purpose thousands of women are now using
mercolised wax, which may be obtained at
any chemist’s. Naturally the process also
removes all such surface blemishes as
freckles, blotches, pimples, tan, liver spots,
etc. It makes the face look years younger
and prettier, and renders the use of face
creams unnecessary.
Another valuable piece of information,
which many women will appreciate, concerns
the success of the new treatment for super-
fluous hair. A remedy for permanently erad-
icating this ugly form of facial disfigurement
now seems to have been found. It is simpli-
city itself. About one ounce of ordinary pure
powdered pheminol, which can be obtained
at any chemist’s, is all that is needed to put
one in the way of completely ridding oneself
of superfluous hair. When applied to the
obnoxious growth this causes it to immedi-
ately disappear, and the continuance of the
recommended treatment is said to finally
destroy the hair roots, so that there will be
no renewal of the growth. 15

“E.T.”: In the “Odd Volume” for 1911—
a book published in London in aid of the
funds of the National Book Trade Provident
Society—there’s a remarkable prophecy in
some spirited verses by one Philip Guedalla
entitled “The Frontier.” Listen :
i High to the north is the Paris way,
Where the road comes over from Metz,
Lights will dazzle and lights will play,
And the guns will peer, and the guns will bay,
And it’s Verdun forts will say him “Nay,”
When the enemy comes from Metz!
The dear little flapper’s eyes were shining
like motor-lamps under her shady hat. “Isn’t
it lovely !” she gurgled. “Jack’s just got
such a nice appointment—they’ve made him
an embrocation officer!”
There is no secrecy about a Melbourne
City Council election. The ratepaper walks
into a booth where one man seated at a
table asks him his name, and another man,
who may be himself a councillor, puts a
blue pencil through the voter’s name and
address on the roll. Then, with the same
blue pencil, he figures the voter’s roll num-
ber on the back of the voting paper, after
which the citizen records his “secret” vote by
dropping the marked paper in the ballot-box.
He might just as well declare his fancy aloud
and have his bet jotted down under the
candidate’s name, as by a bookmaker’s
clerk. Every vote is numbered and every
number is identified with its owner on the
roll. If a ratepayers’ ballot-box had any
sense of humor it would split its sides with
laughter at the portentous stupidity of the
system.
The John Hansens, a family long-estab-
lished at Williamstown, are represented at
the Front by eldest son Stewart, a young
man with an enviable record which has just
been rounded off with the Military Cross.
Here’s his military career, in brief: (1)
Private in the A.I.F. (2) In the Gallipoli
landing. (3) Commission for brains and
bravery on Gallipoli. (4) Went to France.
Now he is Captain Stewart Hansen, M.C.,
and still pushing his way towards a field-
marshal’s baton.
“Tivey’s”: The boys had been overdoing
it in the interests of the camp mess, so we
weren’t surprised when Egypt pinned this
placard on the door: —
Notis Gentleman. —The directine of this establish-
ment beg to notify their honorable clientele, that
owing to the scarcity of knives being pinched so
freely,, no more will be supplied in the feature.
“Ned” : I wanted to go to the Front, and
when the first doc. turned me down on
account of an old stiffness in the knee-joint,
the result of a fall from a horse, I went home
and snivelled over it. The doctor said the
knee would get worse, and although I’d had
it for years without feeling any particular
inconvenience the confounded thing began
to feel worse right away. I wasn’t done,
though. A few months later, when they
seemed more eager for men and less disposed
to look the gift horse in the hock, I had
another shot. This time the doctor discov-
ered varicose veins, and again I went home
and threw bricks at the dog. I’d never sus-
pected I had varicose veins, and right away
I began to feel as though they were coming
up like mushrooms. I waited another four
or five months, and butted in again. The
doctor went over me, and seemed sorry, but
my heart was back-firing. I was outed. The
next time the M.D. found all the other
troubles and a suggestion of lung defect.
That finished me; I went home, resolved to
be content to devote my dying moments to
peaceful pursuits and preparing my soul. I
felt I was a done man. Then came compul-
sion/and I dragged my wasted frame to the
depot again, and wearily submitted myself
to the doctor once more. He spent three
minutes on me, and pronounced me fit with-
out another moment’s hesitation !
“E.S.S.”: It would be hard to find a more
striking example of lack of enterprise in
Australia than in connection with the tan-
ning-bark industry. Before the war the
scarcity of tanning materials was causing
grave anxiety, yet with foresight Australia
could have supplied them in infinite quanti-
ties, at the same time providing work for
thousands of men. The bark of our wattles
is the best that is known for tanning pur-
poses, and South Africans are making out of
it the good money that we should be making
ourselves. They first got seed from South
Australia about 1886 and planted it in
Natal. Twenty years afterwards the wattle-
bark industry was worth over £lOO,OOO per
annum to the State, and the planted areas,
which had before been waste, jumped up in
price as though they had been town lots.
In 1907 26,700 tons of bark were exported,
a thousand of which came to N. 8. Wales!
In 1914 about 70,000 tons, valued at over
£400,000, were exported from S’Africa, and
it was estimated that the . area then planted
with full-grown wattle-trees was 160,000
acres. Meantime our own exports had
dwindled to a miserable £60,000.
“Pick” : For our shortage of mutton-chop
our habit of paddocking sheep and allowing
them to reproduce in their own wilful way
is more to blame than the drought that
periodically wipes thousands of woolies off
the landscape. Ewes, especially maidens, are
notoriously neglectful mothers. When
maternity overtakes them by day, they drop
their lambs and hasten off to join the
flock that has wandered on. The abandoned
offspring becomes at -once the prey of the
crows and eagles that follow lambing flocks
with ghoulish persistence. Forty years back,
before sheep-proof fences criss-crossed all
the runs, a bonus of £1 per hundred for
lambs reared was paid the shepherd, and in
lambing time he was provided with two
assistants. The flock was divided into three
as the progeny developed—the strong mob,
the weak mob and the droppers. Ewes that
forsook their lambs were penned up with
their own or perhaps some other deserter’s
foundling, and left until the youngster was
permitted its natural nourishment. The
impulse of motherhood was then deemed to
be awakened, and her liberation usually
resulted in her duties being undertaken
loyally. In those days over 90 per cent,
was the customary tally on lamb-marking
day; now 70 is oftener the maximum than
the minimum. But, of course, the big run-
owner, in these advanced times, doesn’t
employ a shepherd for each flock. One
boundary-rider looks after the fences that
guard 10 flocks.

Their time to live was getting shorter,

When this here beastly war is done.

“O’Phimerty” discovers an overdraft: —
One of the most interesting white elephants in
Tasmania is Horton College, near Ross, in the Mid-
lands. It was built many years ago by the Wesleyan
Methodists, chiefly through the benefactions of the
Horton whose name it bears. The idea was that,
owing to the Tasmanian climate’s mildness, a big
public school would be fed from all the States, and
provision was made for 200 boarders. Before public
schools were founded in the other States the scheme
proved a success, but that was long ago. The doors
were closed and the books put away 25 years back,
and for a while the magnificent building, one of the
finest pieces of architecture the Speck owns, knew
no guests except its memories. The unhappy Metho-
dists tried to sell their Jumbo to the Government for
an agricultural college, but there was nothing doing.
Meanwhile expenses were mounting up until in
desperation the good men offered the place to anyone
who would settle the overdraft. This was accepted
by a local resident, who got the whole concern for a
trifle under £3OO. It seems a bargain on paper,
but, except for three or four rooms, the place is
still empty and useless. In the big school hall a
great marble tablet yet stands with the names of
about 30 distinguished pupils engraved on it. The
late Premier Solomon was one of these. There must
be a good many Hortonians still knocking about the
Commonwealth. It will interest them to know that
W. W. Fox, the old headmaster, is still living in
Launceston, where his daughter is principal of the
Methodist Ladies’ College. Fox used to prophesy
that Solomon would be one of the greatest Austra-
lians. He would have been, too, had he lasted.
Artist Longstaff has written home from
London to the old people at Shepparton
(Vic.), telling how young Ralph, named
after grandfather, won a captaincy during
the Somme disturbance. The young man
belongs to a British regiment, which he
joined early in the war.
“Chevron”: Basil Watson, the Brighton
(Vic.) aviation expert with the profile of a
beauty actor, whose intention to exhibit an
aeroplane body made entirely of Australian
timbers was noted in B. 2/il/’l6, has just
put both body and wings to the proof at the
Point Cook flying school. Watson got a job
as mechanic with the Sopwith Co. in Eng-
land three years ago. He qualified as pilot,
and after being engaged in testing machines
for the Admiralty, returned to Australia.
Here he built, to ideas gathered in England,
a ’plane whereof the frame was Tasmanian
bass and mountain ash. and the propeller
Bananaland walnut. The French seven-
cylinder 50-h.p. rotary Gnome engine with
which the machine was fitted gave it a speed
of 80 miles an hour, and so stable was it
that for short distances it could be flown
with the airman’s hands off the controls. On
the first trial Watson spent 45 minutes in
the air. climbing to 5000 ft. and making a
nose dive of 2000 ft. Then, at a height of
3000 ft., he looped two perfect loops and came
to earth, confirmed in his intention of making
a second machine as good as the first.

Tempts Goodyear Users
'rf ' - : •• +* " T ■W* •; . •- .% >
There are many thousands of motorists who still
think that one make of tyre is just like another.
But—from actual experience—the many and growing
thousands of Goodyear users now know otherwise.
>
The proof of this is that they continue to buy
Goodyears—and what is more to the point they
advise their friends that by getting Goodyears they
get real tyre satisfaction.
If they did not know Goodyear Tyres to be more
truly economical than all others they would surely
be tempted away by the lower prices of many in
the market to-day. : -
But they are not tempted, they have proved to their own satisfaction that Goodyear tyres are
the best.
Goodyear Branches, Goodyear Service Stations, Goodyear Dealers and Goodyear Salesmen
report business beyond all anticipations —and a big volume of the business is repeat sales.
Buyers of Goodyears are just as keen as you after value for money spent in tyres.
No amount of ordinary advertising can do so much to increase sales of Goodyear Tyres as the
consistent recommendation from owners of cars now equipped with Goodyear A. W.T. Tyres.

BANANA LAND
“Briner” : We’re only a small family, but
there’s a lot of coast to look after, so Aus-
tralian lighthouses contain about 1000
people—2so men, rather fewer women, the
rest children. The largest is on our Cape
Moreton, with 25 men, women and children.
A number of the new automatic lights that
turn themselves on at sunset and off at sun-
rise are in use—notably along the Barrier
Iteef. Some Northern lighthouses nestle
amongst the most luxuriant Vegetation, some
perch defiantly on barren rocks. At the
most northerly (Point Charles) magnificent
pineapples grow up to the walls. Bovs
reared in some of our Far Northern light-
houses have fled in terror at the sight of a
horse, like the Mexicans before the cavalry
of Cortez, which they supposed must be
centaurs.
The Queensland Police Union presented to
the Home Secretary recently a little sheaf of
75 conference resolutions as the first-fruits
of organised John Hop-ism. Although the
State subsidises their superannuation scheme
to the extent of £i>o,oUo per annum, they
think the State might do a great deal more.
The force also demands (“it has been de-
cided” is the phrase) that all members, their
families and dependents, when on leave,
should be given first-class railway tickets!
Also, they want to be “compulsorily retired”
at 60, for experience has shown that if John
Hop gets into a pub at 60 he can amass
quite a competency long before he is 70.
Home-Sec. Huxharn listened patiently to
half the resolutions, and then fled.
Murphy, who is the Independent Party
in the Queensland Parliament, keeps up
the reputation of that ancient family for
humor. A day or two ago Premier Ryan
brought forward a preliminary motion for
the introduction of a bill to exclude from
1 arliament all directors, solicitors or at-
torneys of monopoly or alien cos. Murphy
jumped up and moved that the measure
should also include the following indivi-
duals :—•
Any barrister or other servant or
agent of a monopoly or alien company ;
or barristers receiving fees from the
Grown, including the barrister holding
ing the position of Attorney-General
for the time being; or persons who are
secietaiies, organisers or other officers
or agents of trades unions; or persons
who have held such positions in con-
nection with trades unions within the
preceding 12 months; or persons who
aie members of the organisation known
as the I.W.W.
As it is a revolutionary amendment,”
said the Independent Party, “I have typed
it in red ink.” The House evidently thought
it was a bit too revolutionary, as it would
exclude practically every member of the
Chamber Therefore they turned it down
good and hard by a two-to-one vote.
According to school-inspector McKenna
no child-labor is engaged on any sugar-plan-
tation from Townsville northwards (his beat
extends to Burketown). He traced only
two cases where pupils had been kept from
school to cut cane. Within the same area
are 20 schools in dairying centres. In nine he
learned of no child-milkers; in five the work
done by the youngsters was trifling; and in
the remaining six there was only one in-
stance of hardship. The great spaces of the
North are death to the small meannesses of
the South.
Strabo”: Does “Queenslander” imagine
that he is giving a boom to Hunter, Hard-
acre, Hamilton and May by saying they
were prepared to talk “Yes” on conscrip-
tion . These men have reached the age when
a man galvanises nothing, and they dropped
into line like men making for a fire-escape
door when the C.P.E. said that Queensland
Labor stood for “No,” and asked them in a
curt letter to say Yea or Nay, mentioning,
incidentally, that no reply would mean they
were conscriptionists. Weeks previous Pol-
lock ’ Stopford, H. Hartley, Collins, Fihelly
and Theodore, who supply the bite of the
paity, had indicated that they were against

conscription. That some of the others re-
mained silent only indicates that they were
waiting for a lead, or squibbed on their
convictions when the C.P.E. poured on the
acid. They can please themselves which
honor they take.
“Quidam” on another of our resources :
Among the vegetables lately suggested for paper-
making is the sida retusa. This weed grows plenti-
fully around Rockhampton, and is said to have been
introduced from somewhere as a fibre plant. The
rope-making industry which was in view didn’t pay,
but the sida retusa liked the locality, and settled
down greatly to the sorrow of small boys whose
parents indulge in gardening. Whenever it rains
plenteously, luckless youngsters are set to pull up
sida retusa, and it is about as hard to shift as the
two Billies. Anyone who has attached himself to a
well-developed specimen can easily believe that it
would make rope. Though not as good as it might
be, the sida retusa is not a really malevolent pest,
as it is eaten by stock when it is youthful. But
when it is dry, after some months of drought, it is
about the most inflammable article extant, and a
heated remark will set it blazing.
The Calling.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I woke uneasy from a troubled dreaming
To hear the night-winds waft an eerie “Come!”
I thought at first ’twas but an idle seeming
That sprang from out a brain’s unhappy teeming,
But blended with it rang a rolling drum.
And this I heard above the pealing thunder:
“Australians, do ye hear your brethren cry?”
And then, in tones of pain and saddest wonder:
“What! would ye cut the tender ties asunder
That bind you to the boys who went to die!
“Who went to die that you might live securely
And press your pillows soft in perfect rest;
Who bled that those they loved so well and purely
Might drink the cup of blessing long and surely,
And keep the babes in peace on Freedom’s breast!”
I woke last night. Above the stars were gleaming,
While far below that cry rang over all;
It was not just a fevered fancy’s deeming.
For through my waking moments and my dreaming
I heard those voices call and call and call.
QUEENSLAND.
P. AIREY.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 18, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
This is our civility week. We mince into
the kerosene-lamp emporium and smile in-
gratiatingly upon the man behind the
counter.” “Oh, thank you,” we say as he hands
us the parcel containing the next best to
to electricity and gaslight. We don’t rub
that smile off, Thargomindah, until we get
safely away, even though the horrid person
charged us a dreadful price.
Yesterday was “Button Day,” a holy
brigandage organised by the committees of
various Soldiers’ Comforts fupds. As a
result an extra £l5OO worth of presents will
remind our Billjim of the friends he left be-
hind him.
A Christmas toy fund, to buy happiness
for the children of soldiers and sailors
abroad and in camp, especially those little
ones whose daddies have fallen, has been
opened. Mrs. Ryan is president, and
Mayoress . Hetherington and the wives of
«>n^ e "W, nisters are helping. There are over
0000 children to be provided for in the
metropolitan area, and nobody knows how
many in country districts.
The Mayor (Aid. Hetherington) reached
up and nearly tore the roof of the Council
Chamber from its moorings the other day
when the Soldiers’ Residential Club com-
mittee met. The cause of his excitement
was the old one—the proposal that member-
ship of the Club be dependent upon R.S.A
membership. R.S.A. men attended to ex-
plain that the Association did not wish to
do anything unfair, so it is quite likely the
trouble will be amicably settled in a few
days.
Died in the Military Hospital. Enoggera.
Sergt Neville Young, aged 21, elder son of
a well-known local journalist. The youth has
been impatient to get into khaki for the
past two years, but gave away to his
mother’s wishes that he should first sit for
his final dentist’s exam. Having passed
recently with credit he hurried into camp,
where a grim fate closed its hand on him.
li. H. Turk, one of the first members of
Queensland’s Volunteer Flying Corps, and
afterwards of the R.IT.C., has found a grave
in France, where his skill and daring had
won him the Military Medal.
Josephine Lewis, daughter of sub-editor
Lewis, of the Telegraph, has been ap-
pointed to a sub-professorship at the Royal
Academy of Music, in London. It anyway
sounds something tremendous. The little
girl is a licentiate of the school.
The Musical Union sang Coleridge Tay-
lor’s “Tale of Old Japan” to a packed and
well-satisfied house on Tuesday night. Mrs.
Gilbert Wilson, in a delightful black gown,
embroidered in white, sang the soprano
part, and Lena Hammond’s contralto was
upholstered in cream net over pink crepe de
chine.
Several Queenslanders have been exchang-
ing vows in London with Britishers. Helen
Cunningham, a daughter of the late Edward
from the North, said she would to Lieut.
Edmund Hogg. To balance this, Oswald
Bell, now of a Worcestershire regiment,
tucked in his arm the hand of an Irish girl,
Marjorie, daughter of the late Colonel Flem-
ing, of County Cavan. Oswald is one of
the Jimbour tribe, of which Joey was the
late head.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Billjim and his admiring girl have been
giving a lift to the marriage record. Stat-
istician N. G. Macleod’s figures show that
last year the State went gay over 6141
marriages, which means 8.94 per 1000 of
the population. The previous winner was
1914, with 5895. Bananaland’s worst was
in 1894, a year of depression following the
great boom-burst. In that gloom it stood
at 5.70 per 1000. N. S. Wales has the dis-
tinction of having taken the greatest amount
of “I will” risk in Australia in a year.
That was in 1915—9.70. Also rans: S.A.,
9.01; Victoria, 9.00; Tasmania, 8.03; West-
ralia, 8.00.
“B.”: I went to Brisbane the other day
for a rest and saw a two-up school in full
session on a green just off one of the main
streets. Right opposite the academy stpod
a disinterested policeman. As soon as I
had recovered somewhat, I applied to him
for an explanation, adding that I was a
poor Southerner from one of the States
where two-up had to be practised furtively
m fortresses. “It’s all right,” yawned he,
“one of th’ magistrates decided - the other
day that it was a game of skill —not a
game of chance. I’ve got no right to inter-
fere with ’em.” Great country the North!
I m going there when I’m old.
From an old Melbourne pressman:—
It is quite plain that the Defence Department has
no idea of the supreme importance of Exemption Tri-
bunals under conscription; and I declare that, had
I to vote again to-morrow, the experience I have
had of the manner in which these courts have been
conducted would compel me to vote “No.” Take a
typical case which it was part of my job to sit
through at Richmond last week. A rather plain-
faced youth said he was an only son, and at once
the officer who was watching the cases for the mili-
tary sneered that he was “like other only sons and
ought to have been drowned when young.” The
P.M. merely administered a mild rebuke, whereas
the occasion called for a ton of bricks and a refusal
to again hear one who so clearly failed to grasp
either his own functions or those of the court.
It is estimated that the betting-ticket tax
5; J'7^ / y icto^ian Government will yield about
£15,000 during the V.R.C. Spring meeting,
lias is a guess, but is probably somewhere
near right. Such a revenue from stamps would
represent a turnover by the bookmakers of
about £1,000,000, and suggests that if the
Tote were in operation £6,000,000 a year
would pass through the machine, as was for-
merly estimated. A tax of 5 per cent, on
that would mean £300,000. But Peacock
prefers to fill the hole in the Treasury with
an lOU, and also reckons it better that the
hospitals should be mendicants than be pro-
vided with revenue from a machine which
would neither lie nor yell nor cramp the
odds.. All of which goes to show that a
man is often called Peacock instead of some-
thing else merely as an act of courtesy.

D°, YOU KNOW the importance of rich blood? It will be evident
when you consider that the entire system derives its nourishment
from the blood.
When the blood is poor in quality and unable properly to perform
its function, the system becomes starved.
The sufferer complains of exhaustion, lassitude, loss of appetite
and depression—he is debilitated.
He will continue to suffer until his blood is enriched and strengthened.
This is when Iron ‘Jelloids, ’ The Reliable Tonic, are needed to
enrich and strengthen the blood.
As the blood becomes restored to its normal condition, strength and
energy return —one feels fit and well.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote :—“lmpoverished blood can be
‘made rich and good by means of Iron ‘Jelloids’ the
most effective and desirable treatment.”

Grimm, of Ashburnham, who had an
early-morning scrap in N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment House with Boston, of Wagga, is a
son of Rev. George Grimm, M.A., Presby-
terian minister and author of “The Aus-
tralian Explorers: their Labors, Perils and
Achievements.”
Parson John Walker, a leading light of
the Scots’ Assembly in Victoria and minis-
ter of St. Andra’s Kirk at Ballarat, has had
nve of his boys at the Front. Captain
Stuart Walker won the Military Cross the
other week; and Lieut. Arthur Walker, a
graduate of Sydney Uni., was killed in
i ranee last month. Arthur was a minister
in Scotland when the war broke out (he
was a shepherd of souls at Wentworth before
that), sought a chaplaincy without success
and presently discarded his choker and
joined the Royal Scots as a private.
Judge Docker (N.S.W.) lately told John
h rancis Denehy, a convicted person of violent
and predatory disposition, that he was liable
to 45 years’ imprisonment. Then the Old
Brown Jug sadly gave John a mere five.
There will be some fun in being a Judge
when Science has produced the imperishable
criminal and the indestructible gaol. The
criminals you catch nowadays don’t last, and
a Judge can’t get a run for his money.
tvt Aft ® r allf the P r °P° s al dropped into the
/c. t • v Wales Government Railways
(Salaries) Bill to give free life-passes over
the lines to M’s.L.A. who had sat in three
P arliaments seems to have been merely a
kite. When the wind proved unmistakably
hostile, Holman promptly hauled in his bird,
and the ex-M.L.A. will have to go on pay-
ing his railway fare just like a mere bloke
unless he can logroll himself on to a cushion
in the Leg. Council.
The petition in favor of early-closing
which was taken to the N. S. Wales legis-
lature on a lorry becomes an insignificant
item compared with the one presented to
Prime Minister Asquith by the people
who want the sale of liquor prohibited during
the war. It had two million signatures,
weighed a ton and was 11 miles in length.
Asquith promised to go through the docu-
ment —presumably by motor-car.
One. of the daughters of a notable British
politician is said to be engaged to marry the
interned nephew of Von Tirpitz. Which
would explain a number of irrepressible
stories concerning visits of English sassiety
women to the most luxurious of the Ger-
man “prison” camps.
After a tliree-months’ spell off Williams-
town, the captain of the Russian ship
Samoena expects to turn his whiskers
towards Chile soon. He waddled into Mel-
bourne with oil about the same time as
another Russian ship, the Lindisfarne,
reached Sydney. Like the Lindisfarne he
had a rich and juicy charter to carry
nitrates from Chile to Europe, but before he
could get away the lords of the wheat-pool
told him to chuck his ballast out and load
grain at about 755. per ton. They raised
this to 1255. later: but he waved his scrap
of charter-paper and said he wasn’t going
to tear it up for any wheat-pool. Then he
tied up in the bay and went fishing till
things untangled themselves.
_“Guarnerius”: Twenty-one vears ago a
valuable violin was stolen from Nicholas La
Feuillade, the well-known Melbourne musi-
cian. Efforts.to trace it were fruitless, and the
owner died six months ago without recover-
ing his fiddle. The other day his wife saw
an instrument, ticketed £5O, in a shop
window. Yes, you’ve guessed it —it was the
one which had gone a-missing so long ago.
The vendor had it as a bequest from his
father, who had owned it for 16 years. Mrs.
La Feuillade convinced him, by pointing
out certain marks, that it had been her
husband’s, and he made no demur about
handing it over. As to its wanderings
in the five years after it left La Feuillade
and before it reached the legatee’s father,
history is silent; but the rest may go on
lecord as a tribute to unusual honesty.
Sir John Burnet, the famous Scottish archi-
tect, has declined to act as a judge in connec-
tion with the competition for a design for the
Parliamentary buildings at Canberra, owing
to O’Malley persisting in holding the compe-
tition while British, French, Russian, Italian
and Belgian architects are engaged on a job
of more pressing importance. The British
Architects AND Builders’ Jouenal en-
dorses Burnet’s action, and the Australian
Institute of Architects has already urged
O’Malley to postpone the competition until
after the war; but the ridiculous King, or
Hair Apparent, or whatever he is, seemed
determined that one of his Yankee brethren
shall secure the prize, if absence of competi-
tion can do it.
From Australia’s old theatrical friend
Reg Wykeham:—
Most of the English officers we meet are good
chaps, but in spite of the levelling of war there are
still some snobs left. George Castles, Amy’s brother,
is with us. He was asked to sing at a concert the
other night, arranged by an English major’s wife in
aid of some fund or other. After the show the artists
and officers were invited to have supper at the lady’s
house, near by, and George and the other non-com-
missioned performers were shown into the kitchen to
sup with the servants. That sort of thing makes
it easier to understand how it is that in Egypt the
decent pubs were put out of bounds to Australian
non-coms, and privates; also, why in France as well
as Egypt Billjim is barred from those railway car-
riages where he might be liable to breathe the same
air as a major’s missus.
“Coprosma’U Pity the poor S. Australian
Hop on Sunday trading duty! Chief Jus-
tice Murray says that if a man is seen
coming out of a pub on the Sabbath with
a bottle of wine under his coat, it is not
sufficient evidence that he purchased it dur-
ing prohibited hours. As his Honor re-
marks, “he might have purchased it on the
previous day or he might have taken it in
there." All this while quashing a publican’s
appeal against a conviction. However, he
saved the on-looking Hops from apoplexy by
allowing nine guineas costs. But what’s the
poor copper to do next time?
The Kaiser wants the earth, ’tis sad;
Then why maintain the row,
Since all the Allies would be glad
To heap it on him now?

Hupmobile Reputation Is Our
Biggest Asset.
“We believe the Hupmobile to be the best automobile of its
class in the world” —and what we believe Hupmobile owners all
over the world know.
That is Hupmobile reputation.
Ask anyone who knows cars, whether .Hupmobile owner or not,
and he will tell you two things.
First, that the Hupp Motor Car Corporation has never brought
out a poor car.
Second, that any Hupmobile model is a wonderful value for
the money.
A study of our specifications, a tour through our factory, an
enumeration of the tests we employ to insure quality in material
and workmanship, all prove one thing; namely, that we are not
blind or boastful w'hen we say that “we believe the Hupmobile to be
the best automobile of its class in the world.”

The Inky Way.
“Copy Boy”: Since Armageddon started
122 members of the A.J.A. have gone into
khaki—l 6 per cent, of the membership. Over
30 casualties have been reported; eight men
have gone to their last assignment and about
a dozen have been invalided home.

Some of the gang were talking about the
early days of Sydney Referee. John
Drayton, who has travelled more about this
continent than any other working pressman,
told the best story. Thirty years back, when
wood engravings were used for illustrating
papers, the Referee possessed one block of
a horse. What it was originally intended
to represent Drayton did not know. The
main fact was that the nag on the block
won every race of importance in Australia
for a whole year, but ran under a different
name each time. “We did well with it,
too,” reflected the yaijn-spinner. “Some-
times a piece was cut off the tail; on other
occasions a little was taken off the ears.
But a climax was reached when a mare was
first to arrive at the judge’s box. The
staff scratched its head until somebody had
a brain wave, seized a chisel and made an
attempt to radically disguise the useful old
moke. The weapon slipped, amputated a
leg instead, and ended the career of the
greatest racehorse Australia has known.
“Ouyen”: Still another Victorian editor
has deserted the chair for the camp. The
new soldier is W. B. Hoare, nephew of Ben-
jamin of _ Melbourne Age. W.B. owns and,
until enlisting, edited the Farmers’ Jour-
nal, which waves its hoe at Shepparlon.
This is the sheet, by the way, which was
started by the stock auctioneers of the Goul-
burn Valley, and raised a howl among the
proprietors of the orthodox sheets on the
matter of “secret commissions.”
* * * *
“Rustler”: One of the latest Wayfarers
to don khaki is Jack Craig, the young pro-
prietor of the Wedderburn Express. In
order to relieve him for active service the
townspeople elected a committee to speed
the Express on its way during his absence.
Shortly after the editor’s departure the sole
comp, fell ill and died, and the little paper
missed a couple of issues ; but at the request
of Achilles Gray, State member for the dis-
trict, Government Printer Mullett sent up
a man from Melbourne. Wedderburn is the
home town of Lieut. Albert Jacka, V.C.,
and every eligible man in it has enlisted.
* * * »
“B.”: One of the misfortunes that helped
to the death of Tom Speight, of Federal
Hansard staff, was the loss of his young
brother, J. C. Speight. The latter also fol-
lowed the inky trail, and, like Tom, padded
it in England until not long ago. When
war started J.C. enlisted and made good in
France with a bantam regiment, until one
night recently a Hun shell found headquar-
ters, and he went to his long sleep wfith the
rest of the staff. Twenty-three.

The Bulletin has one more battlefield
contemporary—the 7th F.A.B. Yandoo
(Abo. for “Messenger”), organ of the 7th
Field Artillery and the 9th Field Ambulance
en route to England. Tapped out on a
typewriter and duplicated on board the
transport, there wei’en’t enough copies to
go round and home; so, on arrival in Eng-
land, the Yandoo had itself photographed
and reproduced on art paper with photo-
graphs. Young Playfair, of Waverley, a
captain these days, had a hand in the job.

son Noel are the latest to unload a book
about the war (“Light and Shade in War”;
publisher, Edward Arnold). Malcolm is
Maoriland’s official correspondent at the
Front, and seems to have been suffering, like
Bean, from an overdose of Censor. The
younger Ross was just getting to know the
Inky Way in Mhoriland when khaki over-
came him, and he went with it to Gallipoli.
Knocked out bv Johnnie Turk, and dis-
charged as unfit, he got to “Blighty” and
enlisted for another cut with the artillery
arm, but was unable to carry on. At latest
he was on the Times staff, and had also done
a bit for Punch.

“Filmite”: November 1 saw the initiation
of the South Aus. amusement tax, and also
the disappearance of movie and theatrical
advts. from the Advertiser. It appears that
when the State tax was proposed the local
Amusement Managers’ Ass. canvassed
patrons to sign an anti-petition, and asked
the daily press to help them out. The other
two papers threw leaders at the Bill, but the
’Tiser gave it a slap on, the back and said
it was needed. A meeting of angry showmen
was called, and it is said that a hard and fast
agreement was signed, binding all parties to
scorn Bonython’s advt. columns, penalty for
breach of the agreement being forfeiture of a
large sum. The boycotted daily now tells
its readers all about the lost dog and the
secondhand mangle where they used to hear
about the 19-reel thriller, “Where Are My
Creditors ?”

The Age employs a couple of novelists as
leader-writers and a third to attend to the
State departments. Of the leader-writers
Ambrose Pratt has published at least four
yarns in London, and George Cokerill has
already been convicted of “The Convict
Pugilist.” The most promising novelist of
the trio is the youngest, Roy Bridges, who,
in the intervals between asking Peacock ques-
tions about his alleged policy, has found time
to write five good Australian novels, four of
which have been published in London and
one locally. His latest, “Dead Man’s Gold,”
has just been issued by Hodder and Stough-
ton and is well spoken of by some of the
Bull critics. The atmosphere of the Age
seems favorable to the growth of imagina-
tioq. Alf Buchanan, who was the Syme
daily’s star reporter until lately, when he
took over the editorship of Brisbane Daily
Mail, is another whose fancy lightly turned
to novel writing, and three of his essays in
cultured fiction have found ready publication
in J. Bull’s capital.

Within the Law
Ail traffic laws, rules and regulations are becoming
more rigid every day.
This is as it should be. Safety first.
All the more reason for having the best speedometer
on your car - the Stewart Speedometer.
Without one you unconsciously break the law,
because no motorist can possibly estimate the speed of his
car without a speedometer.
Unless you do drive at a speed within the law, you
are liable to the embarrassment of arrest, the humiliation
of a trial and the possibility of a heavy fine.
Do not smile. It might happen to you any day, as
it has to thousands of others.
This magnetic speedometer is especially built for
Ford and other small-type cars.
Price only £<3/10/- complete.
Priced low on account of our great production.
Why not get one and keep within the law?
Stewart products on a car are your safest
guide as to the quality of a car as a whole .
Most cars are so equipped . in selecting your
next car try to have it equipped with a Stewart
Tyre Pump, Stewart Warning Signals, Stewart
Vacuum System and Stewart Speedometer .
It will cost you nothing more.

A Gallant Australian
V.C. Endorses Rexona
Lieut.-Col. LES MAYGAR, V.C., C. 0., Bth Light Horse
Regt., 3rd Light Horse Brigade, Egypt, writes to us:
“I have pleasure in certifying that I have used
Rexona whilst on active service in Gallipoli and Egypt,
and have found it excellent for the skin, especially in the
trenches. When the skin was broken or cracked the use
of same prevented festering sores, which were so preva-
lent amongst the troops. I feel sure that a box of
Rexona will always be appreciated by any man or soldier
at the Front.
“(Sgd.) LES MAYGAR, Lt.-Col.”

BOYS IN THE TRENCHES.
We are in the trenches in France and all sleep in the

THIS instep-strap shoe has been specially
designed to look trim and dainty
beneath those delightfully feminine
frills and flounced hems that have
returned to vogue again. It is a particularly
pretty shoe, with a fine air of individuality
about it. The front part is patent leather,
and the back and strap are black flowered
brocade, set off by an attractive slide and
ornament of dull silver. The picture gives
some idea of the happiness of this combina-
tion, but the shoe itself is far more charm-
ing than the picture. Made in the dainty,
short-fronted shape and with that smart
Cuban heel which makes walking so comfort-
able, it really is a “find” in the way of
shoes. And ladies will see other and equally
delightful shoes in the latest Bostock ship-
ments, especially if they view them at once.

SLENDER as a poplar
Shall my baby be,
And three little lambs
Shall play round her knee.
One shall be golden,
And one shall be brown,
And one shall be whiter
Than the eider-down.
She will bend like a willow
Over the three,
Little lambs from Heaven
Playing round her knee ;
And when the winds blow,
In her arms she will hold
Each little lamb, •
As it were, in a fold;
And when the hail flies,
Like a lily on its stem
She will shield them with her breast,
Leaning over them.
When the sun shines
She will walls in the fields,
And gather of the flower
The honey that it yields;
And as each little lamb
Feeds at her knee,
She will lean down over
Like a willow tree.
N.S.W.
MARY GILMORE.
The Master of the Collier.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A HARD winter gale—a regular “West-
ern Oceaner.” With waning day the
glass showed signs of rising. The
fierce raging of the sou’-wester suddenly
lulled ominously, the wind shifted, and with
redoubled fury it burst out, like a cannon’s
roar, from the North-West. The murky,
leaden sky gradually thinned, and soon,
between torn shreds of flying scud, the stars
gleamed crisply in the bitter cold night.
At the bleak, wind-swept pier-head lay a
deeply-laden tramp, the Gwendoline, Ad-
miralty-chartered collier No- 513, awaiting
orders to clear the Bristol Channel port. She
presented a gloomy admixture of frost and
sodden coal. From the small portholes under
the overhanging bridge yellow shafts of
light pierced the darkness, and a solitary
dimly-lighted circle showed through the bow
from the fo’c’s’le. A hurricane-lamp, bang-
ing monotonously against the gangway, pro-
duced a dejected, spluttering flame.
A squat, elosely-mufflered figure—coat-
collar up, hat jambed to ears, hands deep in
pockets—squelched his way down the freez-
ing dock-side and made along the pier. His
overcoat lashed against his legs as he leaned
staggering against the hard, driving gusts.
Before boarding the vessel he ran his eye
along moorings and fenders according to the
habit of ship-masters. The small saloon was
a cosy contrast to the outer night. A cheery
fire blazed in the bogey, round which the
mate and two engineers were seated reading
the evening papers.
The master blew iji to the room exhaling
vapory clouds. His nose was blue and his
eyes watering. “ ’Ell of a night, Mister,” he
commented as he lugged off his heavy top
coat. The mate endorsed the remark and
poked the fire into a roar. A genial, rough
and ready man, Captain Dottle; but to-night
he was unusually reticent. He scraped his
mud-caked boots on the doorstep and passed
through to his cabin. The three men eyed
each other interrogatively.
In a little while a voice called through the
partition. “Er... .Mister Rowe,” it said.
The mate threw his paper on the table,
answered the summons, and disappeared
through the door curtain. The cabin was
comfortable enough for a vessel of her class.
A pungent smell of stale tobacco smoke and
kerosene hung about it. The newly-lighted
lamp flared up threateningly in the chimney.
A faded portrait of a bride hung on the
bulkhead over the table, and adorning the
bunk wall was an enlargement of two chil-
dren, head to head, in a lifebuoy frame.
Two or three well-tried pipes hung in a
leathern becket tacked on to the bunk board.
Some magazines and newspapers littered
the settee.
The master pointed to an official document
lying upon the table- “We got to get out to-
night, Mister,” he said. “Them’s the sailin’
orders.”
The mate scratched his head. “Bit of a
picnic pluggin’ into it with a ‘half-tide rock’
like this, eh, sir?” he suggested.
“Orders is orders, Mister, and war’s war,”
retorted the master screwing down the smok-
ing flame. “Lost two freezin’ hours till the
Navy cove could get definite orders from the
Admiral-i-ty,” he continued. Then in a low
tone: “Coalin’ the Fleet at the Firth this
trip, Mister.”
The mate stroked his chin reflectively. “I
seen in to-night’s Advertiser,” he said,
“that the submarine beggars are playin’ up
again around the Lizard, sir.”
“Can’t be ’elped, Mister,” replied the
master. “We’ve got to keep the ball rollin’
some’ow. What’s the good of anythink with-
out the Fleet?” he queried. “And what’s the
good of the man-o’-wars,” he added, pushing
out a patriotic chest, “without us, eh?”
The mate, agreeing that this was so,
nodded grimly.
“No escort, no guns, no brass bands to
give us a shove-off: no nothin’,” continued
the master. “Exceptin’ risks every bloomin’
turn. But it’s our bit, Mister; and, by Gum,
sir, we ain’t scared neither!” There was a
defiant gleam in the captain’s eye.
No. our sailormen don’t funk their solemn
duty. Yet the mate was rather prepossessed.
In his pocket was a crumpled telegram he
had received that day: “Safe voyage. All
well. Love”—that was its brief message.
His pretty wife in Sunderland would pro-
bably be a mother before he reached the
Firth. However
The skipper butted up against his reverie.
“Tell the engineer to let me know soon’s he’s
ready, Mister,” he said, lighting a cigarette.
“And come back when you seen ’im. I got a
paper for you to sign.”
“Aye, aye, sir,” said the mate, and de-
parted.
“Lizard, eh? Submarines! Oh, yes,” soli-
loquised the master. He threw the cigarette
into the basin-receiver and pulled out a
drawer under the bunk. By standing on it
the squat skipper could just reach the rack
overhead. Selecting- a chart he laid it on the
table, and, taking a pair of dividers from a
spiral pen-rack, he gazed thoughtfully for a
few minutes at the lamp. , Then he “pricked
off” the result of his mental calculation on
the chart.
“Oh, yes,” he mused. “The old ’bus ougliter
manage eight knots all right, dtfclass rising, too,
eh?” he added, tapping the “neroid. “Dark
rounding the End to-morrow night, eh? Oh,
yes!”—an expression which seemed to imply
that all was well.
The mate knocked at the door. “Ready in
half an hour, sir,” he reported.
“Right-o, Mister. Just put your tally to
this ’ere scrap o’ paper.”
The mate entered and was motioned to a
chair at the table. In a sort of confused con-
fidence the captain explained : “It’s just a bit
of a will I drawn up, Mister, you see....
that’s all. Never thought of it before,
some’ow. But. .. .well. .. .it’s best to ’ave
everythink ‘all clear for runnin’,’ you under-
stand.... in case....well —just in case, you
know,” he concluded rather lamely.
The mate took a pen and carefully
scratched his name at the foot of the docu-
ment. “That all, sir?” he asked.
“Yes, that’s all, Mister,” said the captain,
blotting the paper. “Give the pilot a cup o’
corffee, and let me know when yer ready.”
Captain Dottle then addressed the note to
his wife, and, in somewhat shaky characters,
printed above her name: “To be opened at
some future date.”
In an hour’s time the Admiralty’s char-
tered “half-tide rock” had cleared the har-
bor. “Safe voyage, Captain,” shouted the
pilot from his sail-flapping cutter. “Hope
so,” replied the master. “And don’t forget
that there letter now ! Good-night!”
An off-shore wind for a start; neverthe-
less the cross swell and tidal stream caused
a short, breaking sea into which the deeply-
laden vessel wallowed. At every lurch she
scooped half the ocean on board, and labored
heavily, for the most part awash from rail
to rail.
“Darned if the Admiral-i-ty needs to issue
‘zig-zags’ to the likes o’ us,” commented the
oilskinned, sea-booted master, jambing him-
self against the engine-room telegraph.
The second-mate chortled behind the
dodger.
“The old plug does the zig-zag manoeuvre
on ’er own whether you likes it or no, eh?”
he added. A heavy comber breaking just
then on the quarter verified the remark —-the
vessel’s head ran up four points to wind-
ward. The ship was in darkness save for
the shaded light of the binnacle, which cast
a pallid reflection upon the helmsman’s
ruddv face and frosted beard.
Having satisfied himself that it was good
enough to have a “lay down,” the captain
instructed the watch-officer to give him a
“rouse-out” if he didn’t see Lundy by 3 a.m-
Then lie descended the bridge-ladder, his oil-
skin coat flapping wildly over his head.
As he struggled along the wave-washed
deck a dark object suddenly swished along-
side the collier. In an instant the captain
regained the bridge.
“Rinv ‘Stand-by,’ Mister,” he shouted, and
murmured between his teeth: “Submarine or
somethin’!” .
Faintly through the gale a voice hailed:
“Gwendoline, ahoy!”
“Sufferin’ Moses!” gasped the master—
“ Must be a destroyer. Here, megaphone,
quick. Mister!. . . .Yes, Gwendoline it is.”
“Right-o,” from the stranger. “Follow
me. I’ll take you clear!”
Like a shot the dark, eerie craft leapt
ahead and revealed her only light—from
the stern. “Follow that there light,” the
master shouted to the helmsman. “See ’im
there, eh? Port a bit.”
“Aye, aye. sir.... port a bit, sir,” from
the man at the wheel.
“Tie a flag around the binnacle, Mister.”
said the captain, “so’s ’e don’t get blinded.”
They steered after the light in the heavy
sea-way. “Things is lookin’ up, eh?” sug-
gested the skipper. “First time we’ve ’ad
the honor of an escort.” After a moment’s
pause he added : “Maybe it’s ’cos we’ve got
Flagship coal this time, eh?”
The second-mate offered no comment. The
typical salt often lapses into soliloquy, and
response is, as a rule, unnecessary.
For an hour the glimmering light bobbed
up and down ahead —now lost in the trough
of the sea, now thrown up high as the
stranger’s stern rose and fell. Suddenly the
light disappeared. In a minute or two the
ghostly destroyer loomed alongside again,
plunging through the inky sea, and throwing
off sheets of wind-lashed sprays as she reared
her slender bows. “All right now, Captain.”
came through the wild darkness. “Good
night!” She was gone.
“Well. I’m jiggered !” remarked the master
to the night. “That’s the reason me orders
says steer 20 miles south of Lundy, eh?
.... By Gum! And yer shore-goin’ lubbers
’as the neck to ask ‘Wot’s the Navy a-doin’
of?’!”
The Gwendoline swamped through a bois-
terous day. “Submarine beggars” may have
been “playin’ round the End,” but under
cover of night the collier cleared the danger-
zone unmolested.
After rounding the Lizard the gale abated
and the sea decreased. The Gwendoline
proceeded on her way, hugging the headlands,
in accordance with Captain Dottle’s theory
that submarines “don’t show off much inside
five fathoms.” Patrol boats scooted here
and there over the smooth Channel. Occa-
sionally a destroyer steaming past in a sea
of foam would hail. The collier’s reply was
to the effect that “somethin’ give us a look
up early this mornin’ east of Lundy.”
“Thanks” or “Good luck” would come from

Kidney disease is serious because it is so little understood. Many men
and women do not know what the kidneys are, where they are, or what they
do. Consequently, when any sign of kidney disease appears (such as
backache, urinary troubles, puffy swellings, irregular heart, etc.) it is often
mistaken for some other trouble, and the kidney complaint grows, unnoticed,
into Bright’s disease, diabetes, rheumatism or dropsy.
The least sign of kidney disorder, therefore, however trifling it may
seem to you, is a serious sign, for it shows that the kidneys are not keeping
your blood pure. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for the kidneys and
bladder only. They drive out clogging impurities, ease the tired membranes,
and build up the kidneys’ strength. Men and women of all ages can place
faith in this great kidney medicine. Safeguard your blood-filtering organs,
and begin with the genuine Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills when there is
any such serious sign as urinary trouble, backache, dropsical swellings, dizzy
spells, rheumatic pain, sciatica, nervousness, sleeplessness, feebleness or
languor.
Cured to Stay Cured.
A. SYDNEY MAN
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St.
Peters, Sydney, says: “For a long time I
suffered from pains in my back. I got
little rest at night, and would toss and
turn for hours. I began using Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and two bottles
made a difference in my health, and a
course of the remedy completely banished
the pain. They have proved a marvellous
medicine, for it is 18 months since they
cured me and I have never suffered with
my back since. I am glad to te* others
what Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
done for me.”
Seven years later Mr. Adams confirms
the above, and says: “My cure has proved
permanent. I have had no return of back-
ache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me nearly nine years ago. I always
keep a bottle in the house, and take a dose
now and then, for I think the kidneys

Mrs. H, McAuliffe, 392 New Canter-
bury Road, Dulwich Hill, Sydney, says:
“For a good while I was almost crippled
with backache, the ailment being caused
by the improper action of my kidneys.
Other symptoms present, that clearly
showed these organs were in a bad way,
were a constant tiredness, dropsical swell-
ings and disordered secretions. My back
was very painful, and I used to feel so bad
at times that I dare not move and had to
lay up; it was the only way I got a little
relief. At night my rest was broken, and
during the day I felt tired and worn out.
At last I decided to take a course of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and as
they cured me I am only too pleased to
pass the word on to other sufferers Seven
bottles of these pills banished my health
troubles, and I now feel Al.”

ECZEMA
A Lasting Cure by
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mi*. H. Watson, sen., 206 Australia Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says: “A
couple of years ago I had Eczema break out badly on my chest. It was shortly
after I returned from a trip to India, where I had gone with horses. I had fever
very badly in India, and the Eczema seemed to be the result of this sickness. It was
very severe, and spread rapidly until I ivas in such a state that the pain and irritation
nearly drove me mad. When I went to bed at night my sufferings were worse, and it
was nearly morning before I could get to sleep. A man I know advised me to get
Dona’s Ointment, saying that he heard of excellent results from the use of this prepara-
tion. I thought it a good idea, and obtained a pot. The first application was cooling,
and the second soothed the itch, and after that I got along splendidly. Every time I
applied the Ointment there was a marked improvement until I was quite cured.
Within a month from the first time I applied the Ointment not one trace of the ail-
ment remained. Doan’s Ointment is a splend'd preparation for Eczema, skin irrita-
tion, to take inflammation from the skin, and to heal.”
Ten years later Mr. Watson confirms the above: “It is now ten years since Doan’s
Ointment cured me of Eczema, and I am pleased to say that the cure has stood the
test of time. lam still quite free of this dreadful complaint.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot, or
post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

Going up Channel is lively enough in
peace times; little chance of a “shut-eye”
now. East of St. Catherine’s, the seafarer’s
bugbear—fog— set in. Ahead, astern, all
round, syrens and ste/im whistles shrilled and
boomed mournfully through the damp, misty
curtain. The heavy-eyed skipper, clad in
oilskins and a dilapidated felt hat, peered
anxiously into the gloom. Imagination runs
riot at such times, and fantastic phantom
shapes appear to loom startlingly out of the
fog. Night closed in cold and dreary. The
Gwendoline kept on, easing speed when it
shut in as “thick as an ’edge.” In the
middle watch the engine-room telegraph
pointed to “Slow.” “Just about cut it with
a knife now,” was the skipper’s comment.
Unmistakably, the deep booming sound,
heard but faintly but an hour before, was
drawing closer. “Keep the whistle goin’
more frequent, Mister,” ordered the master,
who was endeavoring to console himself
with a steaming cup of coffee. Suddenly,
ahead, the fog was pierced by a dim, green-
ish line of light. Captain Dottle hurled his
cup into the corner of the bridge, dashed to
the telegraph, and “Full astern!” clanged
below in the engine-room. “Three blasts,
Mister, quick!” he shouted. The reversed
propeller churned away full bore, but a
loaded collier takes time to “bring up.” For-
tunately the pallid lights were moving along
slowly, otherwise the Gwendoline’s bluff bows
would have smashed into the liner’s stern.
“Near thing, eh?” said the skipper as he
swung the telegraph handle to “Stop.”
“Seems like a red glare amidships there,
sir,” observed the second mate.
“I see—yes—cross, ain’t it, eh? Row o’
green lights, too! Good Gawd !” murmured
the master—“an ’orspital ship !. .. . Ring
‘Slow ahead’ again, Mister.” Then, turning
to the unrecognisable figure at the whistle
lanyard, he ordered: “Steady ’er on east-arf-
north, si l *.”
By instinct, verified by frequent soundings,
Captain Dottle skilfully groped his way to
the Downs. A streaky brightening to the
S.E. heralded a grateful dawn, and slowly
the depressing fog-bank thinned out. The
sun—now some time risen—silently thrust a
ruddy-orange shaft through the veil, and
soon “scorfed up” the vapory pall of night.
The Gwendoline cleared the Straits and
sped north. After steaming for a few hours
she “gave way” to a neutral tramp making
for one of the East Coast ports. The ves-
sels passed close. Captain Dottle hailed
through the megaphone: “Seen anythin’?”
A foreign voice replied: “Yars, surr.”
Then in a stage whisper: “Won moutch-big
soobmaren. Est-sud-est aboot eight mile
or so.” “Thank you, Cap’n,” from the col-
lier master. “Goodbye!” The ships parted
company. “ ’Ard-a-starboard, there,” ord-
ered the skipper. “ ’Ere’s for expert navi-
gation now, you bet you ! Don’t fancy losing
the number of me mess after sneaking along
so far, eh?”
The collier swung on her helm towards the
shore, and was soon skirting along a cable
or two from it.
“Give them semaphore arms a shake up,
there, Mister,” the skipper said as the ship
edged closely round signal-station.
“Reckon the Admiral-i-ty oughter ’ave the
chat too.”
The signal being duly made and acknow-
ledged, the Gwendoline proceeded on her
“rock-scratching” way, keeping just clear of
the outer line of the breaking surf. In a
little while a light cruiser hove in sight.
“She’s got a signal flyin’, sir,” reported
the second mate, who was gazing through the
ship’s flimsy old telescope.
Captain Dottle, like many who go down
to the sea in ships, had an eye like a hawk.
He quickly made out the flags—l.V.L.
“Look it up sharp there, Mister,” he said.
“Oh! ‘You are too close in, keep further
off.’ ” The skipper smiled. “Answering pen-
nant, then, Mister,” he said. “Too close,
eh?” he murmured, knocking the ash from
his pipe. “Give ’em the semaphore, there—
them Navy chaps can read it on their ’eads
or any old ways.”
“What shall I make, sir?” queried the offi-
cer as he swung the arms to “J.”
“Make?” said the skipper—“Oh, just say
—‘l’m all right, I got a fathom under me!’ ”
In an undertone he mumbled something to
the effect that no one was able to learn him
anything about the coast after 20 years’
experience, man and boy.
As the “Navy chaps” made no reply, the
information about the enemy submarine was
passed on. The cruiser’s answering pen-
nant was hardly dipped before she had
altered her course and was off —-to quote
Captain Dottle’s vernacular, “ ’Ell bent for
Actions to the S.E.!”
* * * *
Dusk was slowly closing down as the
Gwendoline drew up to the Firth entrance.
Captain Dottle hung over the corner of the
bridge meditatively smoking a cigarette. His
eyes were bloodshot and his nose glowed like
his own port side-light. For five full minutes
he lounged, gazing fixedly at the darkening
water. Suddenly, without moving his eyes,
he called the mate. “Say, Mister Rowe,”
he said, as the mate came over, “see that
there box in the water?”
“Why, yes, sir,” the mate replied. “Looks
like an old kerosene case.”
“Looks more ’an that to me, sir,” added
the skipper. After a pause he continued:
“Say, did yous ever see a box floatin’ against
stream, eh?”
With a smirk the mate admitted that he
had not.
“Well,” observed the skipper, “the ebb’s
made an hour since, and I’m jiggered if
that there ruddy old box ain’t been keeping
company with us for the last five minutes!”
There was enough twilight to distinguish
a couple of destroyers steaming down the
Firth towards them.
“Shake up the Morse lamp there, Mister,”
said the master, 'still staring intently over
the side. “Make a signal: ‘Suspicious box
on my port beam’ —they’ll twig right enough,
quick now!”
The alert destroyers “brought to” as
though by a magic touch, and the collier
left them to unravel this mystery of the
deep.
The Gwendoline reached her destination
at midnight and anchored amongst a
bewildering maze of looming ships.
“Ah, well, that’s that, any’ow,” sighed
Captain Dottle as the cable chain rattled
out of the pipe. lje was very tired.
Just as he was about to turn in for a
much-needed rest the mate knocked at his
door and reported that a launch was along-
side. A naval officer hopped over the rail
and was shown into the captain’s cabin.
"Sorry to trouble you at this late hour,
sir,” said the bronze-faced lieutenant, “but
the Admiral would like to see you, sir.”
"Admiral wants me!” said the surprised
skipper. “What’s the racket now, I
wonder?”
“No racket, sir, as far as I’m aware,” said
the officer, smiling.
“Oh, well, s’pose as we’s chartered by
your ‘company’ now, it’s up to me, eh?”
said the skipper, wearily struggling into his
great-coat again. “But I’m darned sleepy,
Mister,” he added.
They slid over the side and soon spun
across the smooth, dark water 1 , the coxswain
skilfully steering the pinnace in and out
among an imposing array of fighting ships.
“This way, sir,” said an officer as they
reached the dimly-lighted quarter-deck of
the great battleship. They wended their
way through screen doors, past huge
barbettes, along oily-smelling passages, down
iron-grated ladders, until, as Captain Dottle
put it, they arrived at the “Holy of Holies.”
Knocking gently at the door the lieutenant
announced :
“The master of the collier, sir.”
“Oh, yes, come inside, Captain,” said the
deep voice of the Admiral. “Sit down, wil
you !”
Captain Dottle blinked awkwardly in tin
glare.
“Sorry to trouble you, Captain,” said tin
Admiral, “but I shall only detain you for a
few minutes.” Then clearing his throat lit
said: “You reported an enemy submarin;
off signal station to-day ?” he queried.
“Well, Sir 1 didn’t see no submarin
myself, you understand, sir,” replied tin
skipper, “but I got the tip from a TScowegiai
tramp, and I passed it along to the signal
station, sir.”
“Quite,” said the Admiral, “quite very
good, Captain. Quite good. And,” he con
tinued, after a pause, “you also reported a
suspicious box floating near your vesse
when you entered the Firth?”
“Yes, sir, tide was ebb, sir. and I never
seen a box working against the tide before
sir,” was the skipper’s reply.
A kindly smile lit up the Admiral’s face.
‘Submarines use clever ruses to get in
among the Fleet,” he said.
The skipper gazed in astonishment. Some-
what irrelevantly the Admiral said: “You
must be very tired, Captain?”
“Ready to drop, sir,” the skipper replied.
‘ ’Ardly a wink since I left Cardiff, sir.”
“Humph,” said the Admiral. “A little
whisky won’t harm you, Captain. In fact,”
he added as he poured out a nobbier and
handed it to the skipper, “ ’twill do you
good, I fancy!”
“Your very good ’ealth, sir, and success
to your fine Fleet!” proposed Captain
Dottle, who promptly drained the glass. The
Admiral acknowledged the toast and lit a
cigarette.
An officer reported at the door. “Steam-
boat all ready, sir!”
“Thank you,” said the Admiral. “Well,
good-night, or rather”—glancing at the
clock —“good morning, Captain Dottle.”
“Good-bye, sir,” answered the skipper,
splitting the difference.
“0h....er by the way, Captain,” said
the admiral, staying him for a moment. “I
... .er. .. .at any rate. .. .the submarines
you did us the service to report are... .well”
<( (the Admiral slightly closed one eye)
....“well, they won't trouble you again,
Captain ! Good night!”
“Good night, sir.”
Half an hour later, with an expression of
sublime complacency pictured upon his
weather-Jbeaten face, the master of the collier
gave an inarticulate grunt and dopped off
into a dreamless sleep !
CATHEAD.
Idyll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Your eyes are very kind ; you are, I think.
The truest woman ever stooped to kiss me.
Loyal you are, and from no test you shrink :
When I’m away, indubitably you miss me.
When I return, you perch upon mv knee;
I kiss your eyes. and hair, with playful bite
I pinch the fragile ear whose delicacy
Allures me, and you nestle, which is right.
I take your exquisite ankle in my hand.
With tender touch I fondle one p'ink knee;
And you frown not, nor scold: you under-
stand
Entirely what is due to Love and me.
You hold me closer, and your mouth’s dear
rose
Is freely offered to my lips that sue
For such delights; and so the glad day goes,
And life is sweet because it brings me you.
And yet sometimes I fear the oncoming
years
May see you turn to other lips that plead,
May prove you fickle, faithless: it appears
Women must laugh, whatever hearts may
bleed.
W ill you remember then how close you
clung,
And how your head against my shoulder lay.
And how the world was joyous still and
young
As our hearts sang in hapnv holiday?
Or will you, with no mind to mock or flout
me,
Just go your way, forgetting all about me?
! J vonder -' I once- wondered that of yore,
When I was forty, and the girl was four.
But still my hopes and dreams are all alive
Now I am fifty, and the girl is five;
And while one’s hopes and dreams decline to
die,
Let love exultant soar and sing, say I!
Ten , ’ nn ’-s b once you may love me still, and
show it,
For sixty’s a safe age for arv noet;
And noets mav be kissed bv dames most slow
To stoop to folly. Dames have toM me so
