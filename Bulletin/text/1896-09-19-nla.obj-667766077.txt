[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As full as the days are of light in midsummer his
life was of Love.
Oh, the year on the mountain, the year by the
river, the year on the plain !
As full as the nights are of light when the rounded
white moon sails above,
Was his life of the Love that went from him to
never come to him again !
The mountain at sunrise rose out of the darkness
to welcome the light,
With a glitter of silvery eyes in its facets and
fissures of stone,
And op’ning of buds on the bushes and spreading
of petals of white—
But Ms welcome of Love was prostration of
heart on the steps of a throne!
The year by the river, slow-flowing, slow-flowing;
the year on the plain ;
Oh, the day-skies and night-skies were eostaeies
rolling round spirit-fed sight 1
But then the two lives fell asunder; and whirl-
winds, splashed with chill rain,
Cried above the brute chaos : “ Night, endlessly!
moonlessly, starlessly Night! ”
Sydney.

In the Clouds of Fantasy.
In reality, men and women are nothing
but balloons : they all have a globe of spirit
and a car of flesh. Sometimes—most times,
indeed—the globe never gets inflated, and
the car remains on earth—fulfilling ever so
many useful purposes and ever so few that
are beautiful. And sometimes a man has
Just spirit enough to make him a captive
balloon—he would like to soar higher if he
could ; but his fleshy car is too heavy— he is
tethered always to the ground. And rarely you
find an individual—like Blake, or Shelley, or
Keats—whose head is pure hydrogen, and
who carries so little material ballast that he has
hardly touched earth before he is away again
forever, a speck in the ether almost undis-
eemible by the grosser souls he leaves behind
him. Only sometimes he keeps on singing,
singing, singing as he mounts, and to those
who would fain follow, but who are left be-
hind like the little lame boy of Hamelin, the
mere song of what he sees is very precious.
• * * *
Richard Le Gallienne is maybe hut a cap-
tive balloon, yet his rope of fancy is long
enough to let him reach the clouds, and
sometimes for a moment, one thinks, he
must have escaped from earth wholly. His
“Prose Fancies” (there are two series of
them now) are better than his poems;
he is as puss-dainty in them, and
freer ; and when his mood is at its rarest he
sways you without labor. And for criticism
there needs only quotation.
Science says that the moon is a dead world, a
cosmic ship littered with the skeletons of its crew,
and from which every rat of vitality has long since
escaped. It is the ghost that rises from its tomb
every night, to haunt its faithless lover, the
world. It is a country of ancient silver-mines,
un worked for centuries. You may seethe gaping
mouths of the dark old shafts through your tele-
scope. You may even see the rusting pit-tackle,
the ruinous engine-houses, and the idle pick and
shovel. Or you may say that it is counterfeit
silver, coined to take in the young fools who love
to gaze upon it. It is, so to speak, a bad half-
crown.
As you will 1 but I am of Endymion’s belief—
and no one was ever more intimate with the
moon. For me the moon is a country of great
seaports, whither all the ships of our dreams come
home. From all quarters of the world, every day
of the week, there are ships sailing to the moon.
They are the ships that sail just when and where
you please. You take your passage on that con-
dition. And it is ridiculous to think for what a
trifle the captain will take you on so long a jour-
ney. If you want to come back, just to take an
excursion and no more, just to take a lighted look
at those coasts of rose and pearl, be will ask no
more than a glass or two of bright wine—indeed,
when thecaptain is very kind, a flower will take
you there and back in no time; if you wane to
stay whole days there, but still come back dreamy
and strange, you may take a little dark root and
smoke it in a silver pipe, or you may drink a little
phial of poppy-juice, and thus you shall find the
Land of Heart’s Desire ; but if you are wise and
would stay in that land for ever, the terms are
even easier—a little powder into a phial of water,
a little piece of lead no bigger than a pea, and a
farthing’s-worth of explosive fire, and thus also
you are in the Land of Heart’s Desire for ever.
I dreamed last night that I stood on the bluster
itig windy wharf, and the dark ship was there.
It was impatient, like all of us, to leave the
world. Its funnels belched black smoke, its engines
throbbed against the quay like arms that were
eager to strike and be done, and a bell was beating
impatient summons to be gone. The dark captain
stood ready on the bridge, and he looked into each
of our faces as we passed on hoard. ‘ls it for the
long voyage?’ he said. ‘Yes ! the long voyage,’
I said —and his stern eyes seemed to soften as I
answered.
At last we were all aboard, and in the twinkling
of an eye were out of sight of land. Yet, once
afloat, it seemed as though we should never reach
our port in the moon—so it seemed to me as I lay
awake in my little cabin, listening to the patient
thud and throb of the great screws, beating in the
ship’s side like a human heart. . . .
There were three friends I had especially set
out to see ; two young lovers who had emigrated
to those colonies in the moon just after their mar-
riage, and there was another. What a surprise
it would be to all three, for I had written no letter
to say I was ootning. Indeed it was just a sudden
impulse, the pistol-flash of a long desire.
I tried to imagine what the town would be like
in which they were now living. I asked the
captain, and he answered with a sad smile that it
would be just exactly as I cared to dream it.
‘Oh, well then,’ I thought, ‘I know what it
will be like. There shall be a great restless, toss-
ing estuary, with Atlantic winds for ever ruffling
the sails of busy ships, ships coming home with
laughter, ships leaving home with sad sea-gull
cries of farewell. And the shaggy, tossing water
shall be bounded on either bank with high grand
walls, and on one bank shall be a fretted spire
soaring with a jangle of bells, from amid a tangle
of masts, and underneath the bells and the masts
shall go streets rising up from the strand, streets
full of faces, and sweet with the smell of tar and
the sea. O captain ! will it be morning or night
when we come to my city ? In the morning my
city is like a sea-blown rose, in the night it is
bright as the sailor’s star.
*lfit be early morning ; what shall Ido ? I
shall run to the house in which my friends lie in
happy sleep, never to be parted again, and kiss
my hand to their shrouded window, and then I
shall run on and on till the city is behind and the
sweetness of country lanes is about me, and I
shall gather flowers as I run, from sheer wanton-
ness ; and then at last, flushed and breathless,
I shall stand beneath her window, I shall stand
and listen, and I shall hear her breathing right
through the heavy curtains, and the hushed garden
and sleeping house will bid me keep silence, but I
shall cry a great cry up to the morning star, and
say, “ No, I will not keep silence. Mine is the
voice she listens for in her sleep. She will wake
again for no voice but mine. Dear one, awake;
the. morning of all mornings has come ! ’’ ’
As I write, the moon looks down at me like a
Madonna from the great canvas of the sky. She
seems beautiful with the beauty of all the eyes
that have looked up at her, sad with all the tears
of all those eyes ; like a silver bowl brimming with
the tears of dead lovers she seems. Yes, there are
seaports in the moon; there are ships to take us
there.

Comment on this anti-climaxes as abomin-
ably as the parson’s announcement of next
Sunday’s collection before the organ-echoes
have done ringing through the aisles ; but it
should be said that one personal reference is
to Le Gallienne’s young wife (he himself is
only 31) whom he lost not long ago after a
year of idyllic marriage. (“They learn in
suffering what they teach in song ” —and
coin their griefs to drachmas at the pub-
lisher’s.) And to close with a curious proof
of the human mind’s antipodes : compare the
beautiful ending above with another ending
also previously quoted on this page, but not
in juxtaposition—the reflection which con-
cludes Frank Swettenham’s description of a
Malayan moonrise :
There is nothing cold about this Eastern moon.
Seen, half-risen, against the dark foliage of the
mountain, it glitters like molten silver, dazzling
the eyes, and as it soars serenely upward seems
the very perfection of beauty, light, and purity.
Strange that the delight and glory of mankind
since ever the earth was peopled, the emblem of
unattainable longing, should be only a gigantic
cinder.
Notes.
William Main’s “ Bush Solitudes and
Other Verses ” (Geo. Robertson) are homely old-
man’s-rhymes, lacking intellectual value or in-
terest, but occasionally getting in a quaint heart-
appealing touch. And these rough lines stand
out sufficiently for quotation :
For a man that keeps a bush pub. can’t afford to have a
heait ;
He’s got to be a human parasite,
Manipulating poison, keeping men on till they part
Tneir last stiver—turn them out whatever night.
And if there’s any trouble, why, the constable’s at hand ;
It need not trouble him, for that’s the way
To carry on the business, in a free, enlightened land—
Kind hearts and decent grog don’t seem to pay.
Why, by-the-by, do so many old men turn to
rhyming? Is it a symptom of senile degeneration ?
or an outlet for no-longer-head-controlled emo-
tions? or a kill-time when the poor back-number
sits lonely in the chimney-corner unheeded by
Youth hurrying past in a turmoil of alien thoughts
and aspirations-? And you may note, too, that
old Scotchmen are particularly venomous : the
Irish mostly rhyme when they’re young: the Eng-
lish don’t rhyme—because they eat too much, and
keep their blood in their stomachs?
# * * * *
An article on “ Kipling in India ” in M‘Cltjre’B
for July is worth looking at. An Indian officer
wrote to a friend in Australia a while ago :
“You ask what we think of Kipling out here.
Personally I can never dissociate him from his
odious personality—a little, ugly, spectacled, sen-
suous cad ; absolutely lacking in manly qualities.
Still, there is no doubt that he is a perfect genius
in his way ; his marvellous powers of observation
and his knack of picking up the smallest details
deserve no other name. He is afraid of a horse,
and loathes the sight of one, yet he will write a
better account of a steeplechase than many a
racing man. He has seen a battery of artillery
once or twice, and perhaps talked occasionally to
gunners, and he can write pages of jargon which
no one outside the Royal Artillery can under-
stand. His writings are wonderfully true to life,
though, of course, a little exaggerated here and
there, but wonderfully little on the whole.”
A between-lines reading gets something of the
same result from E. Kay Robinson’s article.
Among Kipling’s former attributes are mentioned
his “stoop, heavy eyebrows, spectacles, sallow An-
glo-Indian complexion, jerky speech, abrupt move-
ments ... no sportsman . . . indifferent horse-
man ” —not a probably-popular compound. But
compensations are noted : and it looks as if K.’s
(and others’) knowledge of his intellectual superi-
ority accounted for the unpopularity alleged
against him by our Australian’s correspondent.
Again, Kipling’s original sketches—or many of
them —are represented as being done after a bard
day’s office-grind ; and a man who stews his brain
for 10 or 12 hours a day is almost bound
to be moody and disliked. He has no vitality
to spare for social trifles. And Kipling
worked with all his heart and soul and strength
whence, according to a favorite theory of this
page, his success. Some wise women have an idea
that an easy baby is a poor baby ; and when you
look at the physiological chances there’s some-
thing in it. For, generally speaking, big heads
mean big brains, and big brains mean big men —
wherefore, big men mean big pangs in parturition.
And isn’t there some analogy between childbirth
and bookbirth? So that—it is curious how all
the thoughts of the world, like all its material
substances, spring from a handful of elements,
perhaps (who knows?) from one element—you
come back to the maxims of much for much, little
for little, for everything payment. It is all poeti-
cally put in one of Olive Schreiner’s “Dreams”
—which are not too well-known to debar quota-
tion :
THE ARTIST’S SECRET.
There was an artist once, and he painted a picture.
Other artists had colors richer and rarer, and painted
more notable pictures He painted his with one color,
there was a wonderful red t;lovv on it; and the people
went up and down, saying, “ We like the picture, we like
the glow.”
The other artists came and said, “ Where does he get
his color from ?” They asked him ; and he smiled and
said, “ I cannot tell you ; ” and worked on with his head
bent low.
And one went to the far East and bought costly pig-
ments, and made a rare color and painted, but after a
time the picture faded. Another read in the old books,
and made a color rich and rare, but when he had put it
on the picture it was dead.
Bui l be artist painted on. Always the work got redder
and redder, and the arlist. grew winter and whiter. At
last one day they found him dead before his picture, and
they look him up to bury him. The other men looked
about in all the pots and crucibles, but they found noth-
ing they had not.
And when they undressed him to put his grave-clothes
on him, they found above his left breast the mark of a
wound —it was an old, old wound, that must have been
there all his life, for the edges were old and hardened ;
but Heath, who seals all things, had drawn the edges
together, and closed it up.
And they buried him. And still the people went about
saying, “ Where did he find his color from ? ”
And it came to pass that after a while the artist was
forgotten—but the work lived.
Picturesquely put, and calling up a host of kindred
ideas : the noxious pill-advt.’s text “For the blood
is the life ” ; vampires ; the o’d life-elixir hunter,
craving that essential ingredient, the blood of a
new-born babe (see him in Dumas) ; the blood-
sacrifice for the life of a savage chief ; that which
purchases the eternal life of religious sectaries;
and a hundred others. On what dim troglodytish
thinker did the germ-idea flash? lie would be
worth knowing.

[For absolute melody— the sweet succession of syllables
—“A Fountain of Tears” has no superior in English.
“Annabel Lee” equals it—no more; and maybe O’S.
owes something to Poe's influence. O'Shaughnessy, in the
strife of bards, is fairly enough claimed as a Celt., and he
had the ear and the fancy which are chief concomitants
of Celtic verse. He was born 1844, die 1881. His scope
was limited, and his performance hardly reached hit
early promise.]
A. Fountain of Tears .
If you go over desert and mountain,
Far into the country of sorrow,
To-day and to-night and to-morrow,
And maybe for months and for years ;
You shall come, with a heart that is bursting
For trouble and toiling and thirsting,
You shall certainly come to the fountain
At length,—to the Fountain of Tears.
Very peaceful the place is, and solely
For piteous lamenting and sighing,
And those who come living or dying
Alike from their hopes and their fears ;
Full of cvpress-like shadows the place is,
And statues that cover their faces :
But out of the gloom springs the holy
And beautiful Fountain of Tears.
And it flows and it flows with a motion
So gentle and lovely and listless,
And murmurs a tune so resistless
To him who hath suffered and hears—
You shall surely—without a word spoken,
Kneel down there and know your heart brokeiL-
And yield to the long curb’d emotion
That day by the Fountain of Tears.
For it grows and it grows, as though leaping
Up higher the more one is thinking ;
And even its tunes go on sinking
More poignantly into the ears ;
Yea, so blessed and good seems that fountain,
Beached after dry desert and mountain,
You shall fall down at length in your weeping
And bathe your sad face in the tears.
Then, alas ! while you lie there a season,
And sob between living and dying,
And give up the land you were trying
To find ’mid your hopes and your fears ; .
O the world shall come up and pass o’er you i
Strong men shall not stay to care for you,
Nor wonder indeed for what reason
Your way should seem harder than theirs.
But perhaps, while you lie, never lifting
Your cheek from the wet leaves it presses,
Nor caring to raise your wet tresses
And look how the cold world appears,—
O perhaps the mere silences round you
All things in that place grief hath found you,
Yea, e’en to the clouds o’er you drifting
May soothe you somewhat through your tears.
You may feel, when a falling leaf brushes
Your face, as though some one had kissed you •
Or think at least some one who missed you
Hath sent you a thought,—if that cheers;
Or a bird’s little song faint and broken,
May pass for a tender word spoken :
—Enough, while around you there rushes
That life-drowning torrent of tears.
And the tears shall flow faster and faster,
Brim over, and baffle resistance,
And roll down bleared roads to each distance
Of past desolation and years ;
Till they cover the place of each sorrow,
And leave you no Past and no morrow :
For what man is able to master
And stem the great Fountain of Tears ?
But the floods of the tears meet and gather ;
The sound of them all grows like thunder :
—O into what bosom, I wonder
Is poured the whole sorrow of years ?
For Eternity only seems keeping
Account of the great human weeping ;
May God then, the Maker and Father—
May He find a place for the tears !

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HE ARNE. —Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment front a sense of duty, as in iny case every other
treatment tiad failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to tied suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My soii, six'years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size' bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tainworth, N.S.W.”
11 We, the undersigned, iiave had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”— Signed

MEN
Suffering from NERVOUSNESS and DEBILITY and
EXHAUSTION should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated
Remedies, which str!ke at the root of the disease. The
symptoms gradually disappear, nervousness and timidity
vanish, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining- in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.

Dr. G-IBBOKTS,

and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result 'of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely:—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

skin diseases may be quickly and permanently

must add my quota for the benefit of my fel-

I need not particularise, but say that I was

“ I was a victim to liver disease, and grew
worse, although treated by several medical

when I had used a dozen bottles I was cured.
To show the permanency of the cure I should
add that this was some six years ago.’’

When you go out shopping, consider, think

of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-

B, whose wiles are innumerable; and 0,

Various Verses,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT A WINDOW.
Fair arm, that liest in pink
Upon her window sill,
Would I were at the brink.
To touch you and to thrill,
More than a song can tell !
Fair arm, why do you hide
Her face from westering sun ?
Would he with it abide
Long after day is done,
His fate and mine were one !
His parting kisses glow,
Shot level from the deep;
Ah ! he and I must go,
But thou through Love’s light sleep
Guard o’er her face shalt keep.

WHERE ARE MY DOLLARS GONE?
Where is my cash ? With this eternal query
I’m pestered all my moments, grave and gay;
It haunts me in the midnight dark and dreary,
It dogs me at the dawn and close of day.
Where is my cash ? My watch, I know, reposes
Safe at my Uncle’s, tightly held in pawn ;
My bills are known to all the tribe of Moses—
But, where the mischief are my dollars gone ?
I lead a virtuous life. A trifle glorious
I may get, now and then, with comrades gay,
And paint the town vermilion, when uproarious,
And turn the dully night to crimson day;
But, when at home at duty’s call diurnal,
I pass my days as peaceably as John,
Our cabbage-vendor, at his toil eternal— , •
Again I ask : Where are my dollars gone ?
The dice-box —gambling? Goodness knows I hate it,
And if at nap I linger now and then
And wander home with friends a bit belated,
’Tis but as man who loves his fellow-men.
My winnings are but scant; with melancholy
I own Dame Fortune’s golden smile hath shone
But seldom on the hands my comrades jolly
Have dealt me—but where are my dollars gone ?
I drink but little. Am abstemious —very !
Though midnight suppers sometimes cost me
dear ;
My bill for Bass and Guinness, cham. and sherry—
I cut it down a dozen times a year.
’Tis not my fault that oysters through the season
Don’t grow on hedges, and the price of yon
Choice wines has waxed entirely out of- reason,
Again I ask —where are my dollars gone ?
The girls—God bless ’em ! —Bellas, Janes, and
Bessies,
They cost me little—now and then a glove,
A summer hat, a parasol expresses
To Maud a fraction of her poet’s love ;
A lady’s watch inscribed in fashion tender,
A bracelet which she sometimes deigns to don,
A brooch that gleams in simple jewelled splendor,
Poor trifles these ! Where are my dollars gone ?
P. LUFTIG.
A TRILOGY OF QUATRAINS.
From womb to tomb, what is the lot of man ?
A little while to play, to weep, to plan,
To work, to laugh and frown, to love and hate,
To curse and pray, then slumber—if he can !
From womb to tomb ! ’Tis but one letter’s chang.e
To link extremes ; and should we think it strange
If from the grave, as from Earth’s fecund womb,
We entered life of wider, grander range ?
If doomed to sleep for ever in the dust,
Or wake in resurrection of the just,
Or live again to meet more direful death,
Why vex our souls? The thing that must be,
must.

“AMONG THE LILIES.”
I must not tell, my sweet, of what mine eyes
Have gazed upon ; the breezes must not hear —
Not even the night-bi’eezes ; they would swell
Full with the wonder of it; and the skies
Would blazon it in starlight far and near :
My heart is aching with it, but I fear
I must not tell !
I must not tell, but I may seek a rose,
A young rose pouting with a pure delight,
And bend my lips above its fair cupel.
Then my sharp sighing will perchance disclose
Some shadow of my thought in my despite;
But what I picture in its wealth of white
I must not tell!
I must not tell why that heaped cloud of snow
Should hold my eyes through all the living hours,
Or why one curving lily should compel
Hot flushes of remembrance ; even though
Sweet words of utterance fell in music-showers,
The memories wakened by those mists and
flowers
I must not tell !

The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1890.
Griffith on Federation.
T-He Federation question has dropped into
another of its long slumbers, and for months
Past it has hardly been heard of in politics.
Almost the only event which lias happened
of late to save it from utter oblivion —in the
Southern provinces, at all events—has been
a learned and profoundly obscure deliver-
ance by Samuel Griffith, Chief Justice of
Queensland, which cast no new light on the
subject and added to it some darkness which
it didn’t previously possess. Griffith is
one of those learned men of large and hesi-
tating mind whose mission it is to shed
oblivion as they go. His intellect can find,
tlle smallest matter, innumerable
difficulties which are not visible to the
average mind, and by keeping them all in
View at once, and looking at them so care-
fully that they seem all of the same size, he
generally comes to the conclusion that every-
thing is impossible. He never, or hardly
ever, solves any problem, but he has stated
many problems from innumerable points of
view, and proved that all the points of view
were equally untenable, and that conse-
quently it. was impossible to do anything and
equally impossible to do nothing -and then
he has sat down and left them in that condi-
tion. Griffith’s contribution to Federal
iterature was about as learnedly obscure as
his contributions to the literature of other
questions, but he managed to emerge suffi-
cmnt ly from a sea of erudition to state one
real difficulty. The statement was made in
a darkly circumlocutory fashion, but it was
The retention of autonomv hv tv.,. „
so far as it is necessary to^un-enderT 6XCept
good of the Federal State, is an essential ,v 6 S' 6ll6l ' lll
must be always borne in mind in consist d iu° n wh,ch
of the general nature of a Federal Government^ 6 Subject
This question, despite the large obscuritv
which Griffith casts upon it, Ls reallv thl
great problem of Federation. Put in fill
language, the question is whether the Central
Government should have as little and the
Provincial Gc ernments as much power as
possible, or vice versa. When it comes to
defining the authority of the two institu-
tions, should the 1 ederal Government be
made supreme as regards certain defined
matters, and everything else be left to the
provincial authorities, or should the Local
Parliaments have certain limited powers and
everything else be left to the Federal autho-
rity ? There will undoubtedly be friction
between the two on many occasions—-it is
impossible to create two such authorities
which won’t quarrel and quarrel frequently ;
therefore, is the Constitution to be adjusted
with a view to the Federal or the Provincial
Legislature coming out on top as a regular
thing? Griffith holds it as an “essential
condition ” that the Federal authority should
have as little power as possible, but no one
has yet shown why it should be essential.
The chief argument in favor of Griffith’s
view of the matter is that the United States
constitution is mostly built that way, but
whether the U.S. in this respect is an argu-
ment or only a shogking example is a matter
of opinion. There the State rights are so ex-
tensive and the power of the Central Govern-
ment so limited that when Chicago was in the
hands of what practically amounted to an
insurrectionary force, it was only by a high-
handed breach of the law that troops could
be sent to guard against the possibility of the
great Pork City being burnt to the ground.
The Central Government only prevented the
disruption of the nation in 1860-65 by another
gross breach of law. It has so little real
power that it can’t prevent the colored popu-
lation of the South being disfranchised by
sheer violence, and it can’t interfere effec-
tively to abolish habitual murder by lynch-
law, and even the suppression of slavery was
arrived at by a more or less illegal process.
There is so little legal uniformity in the
Union that the divorce which is granted in
one State is often not recognised in another,
and in many other ways the doctrine of State
rights has been carried to the verge of chaos.
The U.S. constitution is certainly, in many
respects, a model to be followed, but it is by
no means a model to be slavishly followed.
In the matter of Australian Federation,
there are no conflicting racial interests to be
considered—it is wholly a question of creating
the most workable constitution. If the most
workable constitution could be arrived at by
abolishing the provincial Legislatures alto-
gether, there would be no outrage or injustice
involved in their abolition, so far as The
Bulletin can see. At present the Austra-
lians have certain self-governing powers
which they exercise through the Provincial
Parliaments. The same Australians propose
in future to exercise some of these powers
instead through the Federal Parliament. It
is merely a question how much power the
people in one capacity will surrender to them-
selves in another capacity. Therefore, even
if all the legislative power was surrendered
to the Federal Government, and if
that provincial autonomy whose reten-
tion Griffith alleges to be “essential”
was wholly destroyed, the people would have
just as much autonomy as they have now,
only of another kind. If the provincial
idea prevails, the people of Queensland or
any other province will have more power to
govern their own province exclusively and
less power to govern Australia in general;
whereas, if the power of the Federal Govern-
ment is extended and that of the local Par-
liaments curtailed, they will have less power
to govern their own province and more
authority over the continent at large—which
seems practically as broad as it is long. The
amount of authority belonging to each indi-
vidual will remain just the same ; there will
be exactly the same amount of self-governing
power, only it will be differently distri-
butecl. The question of how much power is
to be entrusted to the united provinces and
how much retained by the provinces dis-
unitedly involves no question of liberty what-
ever. The talk of “surrendering” State
rights means very little, seeing that the
people are merely surrendering their own
rights to themselves, however the matter
goes.. And the “autonomy ”of the separate
provinces doesn’t matter a straw for its own
sake ; if the Federal Constitution can be
made to run easier by having much State
autonomy or little, or none at all, it is all
one. Obviously there must be State auto-
nomy to relieve the Federal Parliament of
an unendurable mass of detail, but in The
Bulletin’s opinion there is at present
moi'e risk of having too much State autonomv
than too little.
* * * *
The State rights theory apparently starts
on the assumption that the separate pro-
vinces are natural enemies, that their in-
terests are naturally hostile, and that the
Australian in his federal capacity will natur-
ally proceed to commit brutal outrages on
himself in his provincial capacity unless he
ties himself up tightly to himself as a pre-
caution. In other words, each province
seems to assume that the first object of the
Federal Government will be to do somethin**
dreadful to it individually, and the only way
to prevent this disaster is to make the
Federal authority too weak to do anythin**
serious. The Bulletin, at all events, sees
no reason or logic in this contention. If the
Federal Parliament has very extensive powers
then the Victorian delegates will have exten-
sive authority to make laws for Queensland
just as the Queensland delegates will have
tor Victoria, and as each province will have
to live under the laws it helps to make for
for ° ne j I \ Wlll P resumabl y do as much
resnectabW r *V he P olitical machine
the Wimmera. The theory 2Statute
must be jealously preserved seems to be
largely based on the idea that wherever
there is a difference of opinion the Provincial
Government must necessarily be right while
the Federal one must necessarily be wrong,
therefore it is proposed to keep the Federal
monster strictly tied up for fear it should do
some injury.
* * * *
So far as The Bulletin can see,' it is much
better to make the Central Government too
strong than too weak. There is no special
sanctity in the provinces as they now stand ;
they were not specially outlined by Provi-
dence, and their casual boundaries don’t
represent any special sum-total of human
wisdom. The first and most important of
State rights is naturally the right of the
States to preserve their own territory, and it
is difficult to see that even this matters much
—an outline on a map is a mere outline and
nothing more. Even if the first Act of the
Federal Parliament was to abolish every
State outline, and map out all the provinces
anew, there seems to be no reason why it
shouldn’t do so, provided it mapped them
more intelligently than the last people who
did it, and it is difficult to see that anybody’s
liberty would be outraged thereby. It is
merely a question whether Griffith in one
capacity is to give himself liberty to do cer-
tain things to himself, or whether Griffith
in another capacity is to have power to pre-
vent himself doing these things to himself,
and Griffith seems about equally free and
autonomous either way. The variety of
liberty which Griffith and other provin-
cialists declare to be “ essential ” includes
the liberty of South Queensland to keep
North Queensland in partnership against its
will, and the right of Sydney to retain the
Biverina, which geographically belongs
to Victoria, and the right of New South
Wales and Victoria to drag the trade of
their far western districts away from its
natural outlet through South Australia. And
the tyranny which they want to guard
against is the policy which would give the
Federal Government power to put right
these anomalies. In other words, the State
autonomy which Griffith holds to be essen-
tial is largely the right of every State to
wallop its own nigger within its own
boundaries.

The Bulletin’s belief, in short, is that
the Federal Government should be trusted
altogether, or not at all. It must be trusted
to make tariffs for all Australia, to manage
the currency, the defence system, and the
railways, and many other public works. It
must also be trusted to make uniform mar-
riage and divorce laws, else an Australian
will be of legitimate birth in one part of his
own country and a bastard in another. It
should be empowered to create a uniform
civil and criminal code, because one code is
quite enough for a mere handful of 4,000,000
people, and because the multiplicity of
codes makes justice more difficult without
necessarily making it any better. The fact
that the Customs law will be made by the
Federal Government naturally implies that
it will likevvise regulate excise laws, for
different excise laws would mean Protection
in one province against another. It should
also have full power to readjust State boun-
danes if a majority of the population of any
distuct demands severance from one province
or annexation to another—the liberty which
permits Melbourne or Sydney to boss out-
.Vl Ag districts against their will is not so
very essential after all. And it is an open
question whether the Federal Parliament
should not be allowed to define its own
powers and those of the Provincial Legisla-
tures also. The Federal Parliament, as the
greater institution, would naturally attract
the bulk of the able politicians from the
subordinate Assemblies. If the ablest
politicians of Australia can’t be trusted to
settle the division of power satisfactorily it
is difficult to see who else can do it. In any
case, the question between Federal and pro-
vincial authority is simply a question whether
the balance of power should rest with the
best men Australia can find to sit in the
National Council, or with the smaller men
who are left behind, and The Bulletin
would give the former the benefit of the
doubt in every case and risk it. At present
the great bulk of the provincial M’sL A
know that they are the small parochial per-
sons who will be left behind, and their
natural desire is to retain as much power as
possible for themselves when the abler men
are gone. If N.S.W for instance, sends
a ’ C '\ R , K y TII£KS ’ Lynj3 ’ See, Crick
Ashton, M‘Millan, Abbott, Wise, and
Barton to the Federal Parliament, then
it may find itself left with a Provincial Go-
vernment consisting mostly of Preacher
Smailes, Whidpon, William Wilks Gar-
rard and Poet Neild. How does it feel
about preserving State rights by entrusting
a very large measure of power to the
Smailes-Wilks Ministry ?
The Case of Thomas Suffield.
Had the case of Thomas Suffield been tried bv
.any Judge but Mr. Windeyer it would be a case
demanding enquiry. As it was tried by Judge
Windeyer, it is a case urgently demanding en-
, Suffield was charged on April 8 1801
at Maitland, N.S.W., before Judge Vindeyer
and a jury, (1) with rape, and (2) with attempted
rape. He was found guilty on the second count
and sentenced to 10 years’ penal servitude—the
maximum penalty. ine
The prosecutrix was a housemaid, aged about 18
employed by Thomas Croudace, J.P* manager of
the Lambton and Durham collieries, residing at
Lambton, near Newcastle, N.S W nv,
character was good. ' previous
Her story varied at different times Tr, „
she said she had been absent during the !, ft . enoe
and evening of Sunday, Dee. 21 1800
home a little before 10 o’clock. The
moonlight, but rather cloudy. On ton nf Tf
gates at Croudace’s grounds she saw Vh OJ !
Suffield. He said “ Good-night ” • she ,I,B*
reply. She passed him and went oii, andalinf
later she felt a blow on the back of the S
which made her silly. Suffield threw her do ™
ness! 6 "' W 1 aU herf ° rCe til] shelo «tcon B cSs.’
Mr Croudace and his son gave evidence at
singular variance with this. They said they heard
screams, ran out of the house, and found prosec
tnx lying on the ground. She was ‘‘ crouched n
and partly on her side,” and her hands were raise
as if m fear. Mr. Croudace said, “ W hat s h
mattery S he - Oh, that
He said Has the bull hurt you ? ” She replied
lam hurt all over, repeating it two or three
times Croudace then looked up and saw the
bull about 30 yards away.
Nothing about a man ! nothing about an assault'
nothing about a blow on the back of the head !
Prosecutrix was carried to the house, where Dr
Stapleton examined her an hour afterwards and
found various bruises and injuries, but none on
the back of the head. Prosecutrix remained in a
hysterical state all night, and early in the morn
mg she told Miss Croudace, who attended her
that she had been maltreated by a man.
Later on she apparently “ thought ” that it was
Suffield who had assaulted her.
Two days after she assured Mr. Croudace that
Suffield had assaulted her, and, for the pur-
poses of “justice,” it has been Suffield who
assaulted her ever since.
* * * *
No judicial attempt was made to square prose-
cutrix’s first story of assault by the bull with
her second story of assault by Suffield.
But the Croudaces’ evidence was no doubt cor-
rect: prosecutrix’s revised story will not stand
against it for a moment.
More, on a previous occasion the same bull had
attacked and injured another person.
More, on a subsequent occasion, it attacked and
injured another woman, and the doctor who
attended her is said to have remarked that her
injuries were remarkably like those attributed to
prosecutrix.
Then the bull was shot.
Judge Windeyer may scout the attack by the
bull as absurd, but, in the face of this evidence, it
seems to be he who is absurd. And a bull is
notoriously partial to a petticoat. It was in the
guise of a bull that Jove ravished Europa.
It ha da ma n T hus was one of the fruits of this
union. Doubtless Rhadamanthus would scout
aspersions on the character of his father.
* * * *
There is thus a tremendously strong probability
that the bull did the bulk of the mischief.
Did it do all the mischief ?
The doctors apparently thought there had been
connection. If this idea was communicated to
prosecutrix, it would naturally put her upon her
defence ; in the interests of her “ good name ” she
would have to show why and wherefore.
She was a woman ; the doctors added a man.
By the hypothesis, her “ virtue ” made it neces :
sary to introduce a third factor—force applied by
the man. But the Croudaces added a bull, and
while he remained in the problem the force
was accounted for. Obviously (to continue the
hypo hesis) it was necessary to eliminate the bull.
She did eliminate him. So did judge and jury.
And the bull is there yet. *
* * * *
The bull assaulted prosecutrix; did a man
assault her as well ?
The doctors’ evidence is inconclusive. They
made no microscopic examination, and, therefore,
adduced no direct proof ; and their indirect proof,
under the circumstances of the bull’s assault, has
very doubtful value.
Yet, if no man assaulted her, why did prosecu-
trix allege a man? Why did she not throw the
whole onus on the bull ?
Either there was a man ; or else the doctors’ im-
pression must have been represented to prosecutrix
as such a certainty that she felt herself under the
necessity of inventing one.
But a consciously honest girl, rather than admit
a forcible outrage by a man, would surely stick to
the obvious bull and defy the doctors ?
Yet if there was a man, and he used force, he
was a most extraordinary man. He allowed his
victim to complete her journey by a lonely
road, to come within sight of home, to enter the
grounds, to proceed within a short distance of the
house to where her cries would be plainly audible
—and then, before the lights were out, before the
household were settled in bed, he assaulted her
with brutal violence.
Is it credible ?
And the ruffian actually sat on the gate in the
moonlight to be identified—on the gate, where he
could hear the bull laughing at him !
* * * *
Nevertheless, that man existed, and that man
was Suffield. The prosecutrix said so.
There was not a scrap of evidence to show it
beyond the prosecutrix’s say-so.
Suffield did not even know prosecutrix —bad
never spoken to her. (This she admitted). But
he was a good-looking fellow ; she had seen bun
at a distance, and admired him, and asked his
name (this was clearly in evidence), and doubt-
less thought about him as girls of 18 will think
about good-looking fellows. And Suffield went
to gaol for 10 years.
It was Suffield’s word v. prosecutrix’s, and
Judge Windeyer believed prosecutrix—as usual.
Yet, in order to believe prosecutrix, you had to
get rid of the bull, and to swallow the remarkable
ruffian who sat on the gate ; while in order to dis-
believe Suffield you had to dispose of —
1. Alibi sworn by Mrs. Warren, with whom
he lodged, to the effect that from 9.30 to 10.40 p-m.
on the evening in question Suffield was in ms
bedroom lying down, with the door open; that he
was certainly there between 9.45 and 10 p.m.
2. Alibi sworn by Miss Warren, daughter of
above, aged IG, corroborating this.
3. Oath of Miss Warren that Suffield had
only two pairs of boots, of which neither was m
the bedroom on the evening in question ; so that
if he was a ruffian on a gate he was a ruffian with-
out his boots on, who had climbed out of a window
and run half-a-mile and back again barefooted on
the chance of finding a girl of whom or whose
movements he knew apparently nothing, and
whom he might try to criminally assault for five
minutes or less almost under her employer’s win-
dows at 10 o’clock in the evening !
4. Fact that Suffield had to do this without
the newly-washed moleskins and shirt which he
was wearing at the time, and which were examined


by the police, showing any spots or stains, and
without Suffield getting one scratch or bruise or
mark.
The jury, with the countenance of Judge WiN-
deyer, disposed of everything.
* * » •
Yet Suffield bore an excellent character. He
was working as an engine-driver in a mine, but
the evidence showed that he was intelligent, edu-
cated, worthy to fill what are considered better
positions.
If the statement of an 18-year-old girl (the hysteri-
cal age—especially for an English girl like prosecu-
trix, generally later in reaching puberty) can sur-
vive her contradictions, survive the incident of the
bull, survive the improbability of her story of the
time and place of the alleged assault, and blast a
good character, over-ride a double alibi strongly
corroborated, and send Suffield to prison for 10
years, it is obvious that any man in the district
might have stood in Suffield’s shoes.
If such a defence counts for nothing against
such a prosecution, what defence can count ?
This was felt at the time, and a strong agitation
arose for a reconsideration of the case, and beat
vainly against the prejudices and precedents of
the Department of Alleged Justice.
This is where the abomination of a Botany Bay
bureaucracy comes in.
In New South Wales, once a man is convicted —
rightly or wrongly—the bureaucracy pigeon-holes
him and puts him away. That man is done with.
The amour propre of the courts, of the police, of
the self-satisfied Department, closes their ears and
eyes and noses to the foulest injustice. To suggest
that—even inadvertently—an injustice has been
perpetrated is to reflect upon them.
Therefore, they all fight like devils, tooth and
nail and claw, to keep the man in the pigeon-hole,
the case from the light of day.
* * * *
The Department of Alleged Justice is fighting
so in the case of Thomas Suffield.
The accidental Minister-in-charge is a country
lawyer—narrow, obstinate, of mean capacity,
apparently incapable of a lofty thought or a warm
emotion.
He in effect says that Suffield shall stay in his
pigeon-hole—in defiance of the above-recited facts,
in defiance of the law.
For what does the law say ?
Section 383 of N.S.W. Criminal Law Amend-
ment Act declares that “whenever, after the con-
viction of a prisoner, any doubt or question arises
as to his guilt, or any mitigating circumstance in
the case, or any portion of the evidence therein, it
shall be lawful for any justice, by direction of the
Governor —on the petition of the prisoner, or
some person on his behalf, representing such doubt
or question —or by direction of a judge of the
Supreme Court, of his own motion—to summon,
and examine on oath, all persons likely to give
material information on the matter suggested.”
In Suffield’s case these conditions are all
present. There is doubt or question as to his
guilt; 6000 residents of the Newcastle district have
petitioned for examination into his case; many
members of Parliament —including those repre-
senting the Lambton and neighboring districts —
express grave apprehensions that he has been un-
justly convicted.
The Department of Alleged Justice is not asked
to set Suffield free —it is only asked to permit
enquiry into his case.
It refuses, absolutely and obstinately, to permit
enquiry.
Suffield is in his pigeon-hole, neatly strangled
with red tape, and there he may rot till the Day
of Judgment.
Damn the Department of Alleged J ustice !
The Bulletin does not know whether Suffield
is innocent or guilty; but it knows the facts
demand, and the law allows, an enquiry into his
case.
Out with Suffield from his pigeon-hole !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Beer.
The Local Option Bill, introduced, in N.S.W.
Assembly, the other day, by P.M.G. Cook, is
the beginning of a big tight on the compensa-
tion question, and a good many other questions
as well. Minister Cook is distinctly against com-
pensation, and in that respect The Bulletin is
with Cook, but not wholly for Cook’s reasons.
When the brewer throws his dummy publican
out of his “ tied ” house, says the P. M.G., he
doesn’t compensate the victim, and when the
Government fires out the real owner, the
brewer, there is no reason why he should be
compensated either. Moreover the publican is
licensed each year to carry on his trade for one
year only. There is nothing in the license
about any right of renewal; there is no pro-
mise, direct or implied, that it will be renewed ;
the license is paid for one year only; if the
publican chooses to assume that it will be
renewed the community is no more liable to
pay for his assumption than it would be if he
assumed that he was going to be made a
K.C.M.G. Further, the country can’t honestly
or logically compensate him without compen-
sating also the vigneron, and his laborers, the
cooper, bottler, barmaid, barman, the brewer
and his employes, the liquor-importer and his
employes, the vigneron’s landlord for the loss
of a tenant, the owner of the pub. for depre-
ciation of his property, itself for loss of rates
through depreciation in the rateable value of
the property, and so on ; and as it can’t afford
to do this the compensation question drops
down dead on the spot. There are several
other matters, however, on which J. Cook is
much less logical. He proposes Local instead
of National Option, and this is a poor, weak,
hopeless device at the best. Local Option
means that here and there a prohibition district
will be created in which no liquor can
lawfully be sold, and all the liquor it
wants will come in from the next dis-
trict a few miles away, and all its
hard-faced inhabitants will go into the next
district periodically for a great satisfying
drunk. National Option means that, except
for illicit distillation, there will be no liquor to
be had nearer than the next province, and, if
illicit alcohol can be kept down, its adoption
would mean that all N.S.W. would be sober,
barring only a thin fringe of gin round the re-
mote borders. Local Option would certainly
bring business to the trains and trams, carrying
people into the drinking districts and back
again, and promote horse, bicycle, and pedes-
trian exercise for the same purpose, but, after
all, it is only like Mr. Cook habitually
washing two or three places on himself,
each the size of a half-crown, and leav-
ing the rest of himself as he was.
Further, there is no more reason why some
parts of a province should be permitted to have
alcohol and others prohibition than that one
electorate should be allowed on its own separ-
ate vote to have Freetrade or Protection or the
Single-tax or Marriage with a Deceased Wife’s
Sister, while the next one hasn’t, or that
Sydney and Newcastle should be allowed to set
up different divorce-laws. If the system that
the majority for the whole province bosses the
minority is good enough in other things, why
shouldn’t it be good enough in this matter also ?
Another question which naturally arises is this :
Seeing that the Cook party wants a referendum
so badly on its own fad is that same party
prepared to give the referendum all round, or
do the teetotallers want it for themselves only ?
Further, will they put the whole question to
the suffrage ? Instead of simply allowing the
community to vote as to whether licenses shall
be abolished or reduced or remain as they are,
will they also take a vote as to whether they
shall be increased ? And when they ask that
a Cold Tea majority shall be empowered to
compel a whisky minority to abstain from
alcohol, will they authorise a whisky majority
to compel a Cold Tea minority to drink
alcohol, so that things shall be fair all
round ? Again, are they prepared to pro-
hibit the export of beer, wine, spirits
and all other intoxicants, or do they simply
propose to shut down on local consumption as
much as possible, and let the stuff be exported
instead of drunk on the premises, and thus
permit N.S.W. to make money by passing the
Drink Curse along? And, supposing Sydney
goes in strong for Local Option, will Tooth’s
and Toohey’s and the other dozen Sydney
breweries be shut up by that same vote, or will
the capital city simply swear off drink itself
and still make money by corrupting the poor
weak brother in the interior ? Moreover, will
that same vote prevent foreign liquor being
landed at Sydney for distribution in the in-
terior, so that this branch of trade will have to
shift to Newcastle or Grafton or some other
unregenerate town, or will the city still make
all the money it can by the distributing trade
as well as by manufacture, and thereby further
corrupt the weak brother in the back-blocks ?
Lastly, what does Mr. Cook think of the policy
of the Government of which he is a member in
heavily protecting the local beer-manufacturer
in opposition to its own Freetrade principles
and to his own teetotal principles ? A few more
questions are held over for want of space.
The “ Evils of State Banking.”
A typical slab of Sydney Daily Telegraph’s
articles on the “ Evils of State Banking ” :
The answer —a most immoral and pernicious one, be-
sides being fallacious—is suggested in the paragraph from
the Labor political address already quoted : —“ A national
bank would he in its endurance coeval with the stability
of the nation.” That is to say, it would have, as an addi-
tional security to depositors, the tax-paying power of the
whole community, together with the right to pledge the
earnings of future generations if occasion required and
opportunity offered. So that, if A deposited £lOO in the
State Bank, and the State lent it to B on security which
turned out to be worth only £25, it could tax the whole
alphabet to make up the difference to A, or, if that did
not suffice, it could “ float a loan ” on the security of the
future taxpaying power of the alphabet and its children.
. . . Compared with the evident expectations of how a
State Bank would invest its funds, these (private) institu-
tions do not advance a sufficient amount of money upon
their securities, and they charge too high a rate of inter-
est. But if the State Bank is to advance more upon the
same securities than the present hanks will do, the mar-
gin of security must of necessity he less than that
of the present banks, and the risk of loss must conse-
quently he greater. And if the risk of loss with
private hanks is now so great that they prefer the
humiliation of reconstruction to facing it, how can an in-
crease of such risk, by any possibility, be looked upon in
the light of an increase in stability? Again, it is fair to
assume that, in the aggregate, those who borrow money
do so upon the best terms that they can. That is to say,
no one pays 9 per cent, to a bank for money if he can get
it elsewhere for 8 or 7 per cent. It follows, then, that (in
the aggregate) those who owe money to the banks pay (or
are charged) the ruling rates, because they are the lowest
at which the required accommodation can be obtained.
This contains, practically, the gist of the whole
argument against State Banks, and the argu-
ment won’t bear inspection. There isn’t, and
never was, any promise that the State Bank
would lend more upon its securities than the
private banks do. It is believed, however,
that it will lend at lower interest. In the first
place, the worst troubles of the private banks
are not through lending too much on securities
to their regular customers but through lending
vast sums without any security to the directors
and their friends. A bank with an independ-
ent State auditor —not a mere shadow like the
average private auditor who dare not aggravate
the directors for fear of losing his billet—is
practically certain not to do so. This should
stop one big loss which otherwise the interest
would require to cover. The State Bank will get
its capital at, say, 3J per cent., and beyond that
it will have no dividends to pay. Against this,
consider the dividends paid by the private in-
stitutions in their good days. In ’B7, for in-
stance, the Commercial of Sydney paid 25 per
cent. (.£150,000); 8.N.5.W., 17i (.£175,000) ;
Australasia, 12 per cent. ; Union, 14 per cent. ;
A.J.S., City, New Zealand, and Commercial of
Australia, 12J each ; National and Q.N., 15
per cent, each ; and so on. In one half-year of
1888, fourteen Australian banks doing business
in N.S.W. paid £818,172 in dividends, while a
State Bank, even if it borrowed its capital at
4 per cent., would have paid only £234,460.
That is one reason why the State Bank could
lend at lower rates than the private institutions,
and yet accumulate larger reserves. Further,
the State Bank would not tout for English de-
posits et ruinous interest. The fact that it had
State security behind it would so minimise the
chances of a run by depositors that it could
work safely with smaller cash reserves—in other
words, it could keep less money lying idle and
unprofitable. The absolute security of its
State guarantee would get it deposits at the
very lowest rate of interest. With deposits at
a minimum rate of interest, no necessity for
keeping very large coin reserves, no 15 or 20 or
25 per cent, dividends to drain away its profits
in good years so that it would have very scanty
reserves against bad ones, a solid guarantee, in
its State audit, against the lending of huge
sums on no security to directors and their
parasites, no reconstructions to saddle it with,
the responsibility of paying per cent, for many
years on money that could otherwise be obtained
at 3 per cent., a note-issue which the State
guarantee would make equivalent within the
country to gold, a large connection to start
with in the shape of the Government business—
with all these advantages it is very uphill work
for the Telegraph to demonstrate the evils of
State Banking. The institution would doubt-
less, as mentioned in the Telegraph’s jeremiad,
sometimes lend ,£lOO on security which depre-
ciated to £25, but in that case it would simply
charge the loss to bad debts as the honest pri-
vate banks do, and pay it out of profits, as they
do, and there would be an end of it. No one
ever proposed to guarantee that the State Bank
wouldn’t make losses. As to the statement
that people who now borrow at 7 or 8 or 9 per
cent, borrow at “ the lowest rate at which the
accommodation can be procured,” no one ever
denied that. It is so self-evident that it isn’t
worth mentioning. Everyone borrows at the
lowest rate he can manage whether it be 9 or
860 per cent. It is an equally-solid fact that
everybody who falls off a roof falls as short a
distance as he can manage—and one fact is just
as relevant to the State Bank matter as the
other.
Protection for Stamp Collectors.
Following upon a philatelic outcry against un-
fair traffic in obsolete stamps by the Sydney
postal authorities comes a discovery of un-
authorised and scandalous trading by certain
individuals at Melbourne G.P.O. An unsuit-
able issue of 2s. stamps in dark green was made
last year, and after eight days the issue was
officially stopped, 150 sheets of unsold “speci-
mens ” being condemned to destruction. Im-
mediately the stamp-collector’s price for the few
specimens that had gone into circulation rose to
a fancy figure, and dealers bought and sold them
as genuine rareties. Meanwhile the condemned
sheets were privately disposed of by two or
more officers of the G.P.0., who, without abso-
lutely robbing the Department —for they sub-
stituted ordinary 2s. stamps in place of the
obsolete ones they were selling made a
shilling or eighteenpence premium on each item
in the illicit deal. The craze for stamp-
collecting cannot survive many more revela-
tions of this sort. Pretty soon the obsolete
stamps that would, in the ordinary course of
things, be most valuable, will become impro-
perly common, like the five shilling Samoan
stamps, postmarked without going through the
post, or unpostmarked if the buyer prefers, and
procurable at about the ordinary price of
bananas. All the charm of collecting—-and it
seems to have charms for many people, includ-
ing Baron Rothschild and the Duke of York
—will disappear. Philatelic fanaticism needs
the romance of dirty unique specimens and
fabulous prices to keep it going. Considering
that stamps mark historical changes, the over-
throw of potentates, establishment of re-
publics, &c., and have, moreover, a particu-
lar interest for citizens of the Hempire which
issues fifty different pictures of Y.R. from its
various post-offices; and again also remembering
that the postage-stamp sprang from dear old
Hinglandand claims Queen Victoria as its patron
saint, so to speak, The Bulletin moves a vote
of condolence with every collector who paid 10s.
in the open market for a dark-green Victorian
stamp which he might have purchased surrepti-
tiously for three “bob.” These people put
faith in the Postal Department, and suffered for
it.
Brer Babbit.
Another Bill has been introduced in N.S.W.
to wipe out brer-rabbit, two previous Acts
having been utterly insufficient for the purpose.
On the first, in fact, he fattened and multiplied,
and moreover provided the means for the most
lurid razzle-dazzle that most townships in the
Never Never have ever known. The second he
could afford to treat with silent contempt.
Minister for Lands Carruthers, having filled
himself up with rabbit lore, now tries what a
city attorney can do to grapple with about the
most puzzling problem of the back-country.
On the whole, he doesn’t seem to have got quite
so mixed as might have been expected, because
even a good bushman might easily get astray
here. For (and this is at the bottom of the
whole thing) there isn’t one rabbit problem ;
there are three or four. And the problem in
the Central division isn’t much more like the
problem in the Far North-West than measles
are like typhoid. Two objects have apparently
been aimed at in this Bill—one, simultaneous,
compulsory, and continuous vermin-destruc-
tion ; the other, local administration. Down
to date one squatter, using poisoned twigs or
pollard, has worked in the winter; his neigh-
bor, using poisoned water or fence-traps, has
worked in the summer. This has been an ex-
cellent arrangement for the rabbit. Another
neighbor, generally a mortgage co., hasn’t
worked at all. Local boards (three-fifths
locally appointed, two-fifths Govt, nomineed)
may direct that destruction shall commence on
a certain date, and may say what means shall be
adopted. The latter provision will be mostly im-
practicable, because every paddock has its own
characteristics, and these should govern the
means to be employed. If a holder fails to
move, the board may do the work, and the cost
is to be a first charge upon the defaulter’s pro-
perty. The boards may strike a rate to cover
cost of administration, <fcc., up to id. per sheep.
This ought to be more than enough ; but it is
dangerous to fix a figure like that. For id. per
sheep may mean, in the least-infested country,
-Jd. per acre, whereas in the worst-infested
country, which doesn’t now average a sheep to
20 acres, it means l-40d. per acre. And it will
cost as much per acre to effectually carry out
the work in the worst-infested country as in
the other. The average pastoral expert in the
rabbit country puts the cost of repression
{extinction, they assume, is out of the ques-
tion) at id. per acre per annum—say, on
the average, l-18d. per sheep. It is,
therefore, not easy to see why any board
should be empowered to strike a rate
of per sheep, except, it may be, to repay
loans got for the construction of barrier fences,
seeing that the board does not itself carry out
the work of destruction. What is to be feared
is that expenses of administration may be piled
on, just as in connection with the adminis-
tration of the Lands Dept. One very satisfac-
tory feature of the Bill is that the duty is im-
posed upon the Minister to destroy rabbits on
public lands. Hitherto, abandoned areas in the
West have been the principal breeding-places
for both rabbits and wild dogs, and their exis-
tence has imperilled all the efforts of Crown
tenants, which discouraged many from making
any efforts at all. Even now it seems that the
destruction of vermin on these lands is con-
tingent upon Parliament voting the money. It
is, however, doubtful whether any difference
should be recognised between the Minister and
Crown tenants and private owners. The latter
will certainly never feel safe so long as there is
any better escape for the Minister than for any
other individual, especially as hitherto succes-
sive Ministers have inactively permitted des-
tructive hordes to issue from these lands. Other-
wise, and generally speaking, the Bill is better
than the inexperience of the Minister and the
complexity of the problem might have led
one to expect.
S.M. Herald on the Vic. match industry
It is published far and wide that the match industry of
Victoria has acquired two-thirds of the local trade. It is
admitted that it may have given the public matches
cheaper to the extent of 3d. per gross, or £1440 in all.
And it has also given ernploymentto 65 persons, including
57 females. But what has been the price? The earnings
of the operatives are equal to £1755 per annum, or, with
the total saved by the public, £3195. The Customs re-
venue suffers to the extent of £lO,OOO. The Journal of
Commerce, which gives these particulars as the result ot
an inquiry, pertinently asks who has obtained the differ-
ence of nearly £7OOO.
Figure out this wondrous hunk of Freetrade
reasoning seriously. The State obtains a cer-
tain amount of revenue from the duty on
matches. The industry pays ,£1755 a year in
wages. The public saves, it is estimated,
£1440 a year by the reduction in price. If the
duty was retained, however, and if there was
no local manufacture, so that all matches paid
duty, the revenue would be £lO,OOO better off,
and assuming that the importers, having no
local competition to face, didn’t raise the price,
then the country would be better off by about
£7OOO, because it would pay that amount to
itself. In other words, since the duty was put
on the revenue gains a small amount, the
public gets its matches cheaper, sundry em-
ployes get £1755 a year in wages, the local
manufacturer gets a profit, and, according to
the S.M. Herald, the country loses £7OOO a
year, not because it ever got that amount, but
because it might have got it if something had
happened which didn’t, and if something else
hadn’t naturally ensued as a consequence of the
thing that didn’t happen.
Sydney Telegraph sums up the reasons why
there should be no State Bank thus :
1. Because of the admitted evils which have accom-
panied State control of less important, less difficult, and
less complicated matters. .
2. Because of the admitted risks which are involved in
the extension of State administration in any direction.
3. Because of the new and dangerous relationship that
it would create between the State and many of its indivi-
dual members.
4. Because the proposal involves either the taking, over
of existing institutions or their extinction by competition.
5. Because, if it involves taking over any of the exist-
ing institutions, the risks of loss are too great and too
certain to warrant its consideration.
6. Because, if there are no such risks, there is no virtue
in the coveted State guarantee to depositors.
7. Because the State has quite enough to do to pay its
own way, and requires all its tax-levying power to do this
with.
8. Because the principal results expected to accrue
from the establishment of a State Bank can be proved to
be injurious to the best interests of the people, even if
such results did transpire.
As regards Nos. 1,2, 3, 7 and 8 the Telegraph
says the “evils” and the “risks” are “ad-
mitted,” and The Bulletin, on equally good
authority, says they aren’t; also, the Tele-
graph says the “ new relationship ” would be
“dangerous,” and The Bulletin says it
wouldn’t. Further, the Telegraph says the
“ State has quite enough to do to pay its own
way,” and The Bulletin replies that it has,
only this has nothing to do w'ith the case ; and
when the Telegraph says that the “ principal
results expected ” from a State Bank “ can be
proved to be injurious,” this paper asks why
the Telegraph doesn’t prove them so ? As
regards No. 5, which covers everything that
remains, the Telegraph says that there would
be “great” and “certain” loss if the State
took over any of the private banks. Now,
there could be no certain loss unless the bank
taken over hadn’t enough assets to cover its
liabilities. The Telegraph says, in effect, that
this is the state of all of them ! And after
declaring, almost in so many words, that all
the private banks are so rotten that they can’t
be taken over without loss, it demands that the
private bank system should continue just as it
is. Also, it heads this ghastly inference ‘ ‘ The
Evils of State Banking.”
A CALL is being made for an inquiry into the
cause of the increase in the number of fatal
accidents at the Broken Hill mines—l 9 last
year and 11 this year to the end of August. A
preliminary question has been asked in N.S. W.
Assembly. But any inquiry is bound to be
inconclusive. For there is no single over-
shadowing cause. Curiously, the mammoth
open-cuts, which at one time threatened to
become awful man-traps, are comparatively
free from accident. Nor are the victims
elsewhere mostly new hands—strangers to
the mines. Contract work, and especially
payment per set or foot, is no doubt re-
sponsible for a good deal, particularly since
the “cutting” of prices became general. The
most important fact probably is that the men
have nob yet accustomed themselves to the new
conditions. The precautions against accidents
are generally so complete that men forget that
they are engaged in a highly dangerous call-
ing, and when they had plenty of time and
there wasn’t any inducement to put in over-big
charges, or try short-cuts through the workings
underground, it didn’t matter so much. Now,
they do attempt these things, mostly in defiance
of some regulation that can be pointed to, or of
some instruction that can be conveniently re-
membered, and accidents naturally follow.

cleansed by throwing them into the fire are an

Nat Goodwin’s comedy co., which has got

places than the departed Chinatowns, opened
through its nose at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday
night to a big house with the “Nominee,” also
with inuch dclat and a splendid view of the Hud-
son River in the background. Said “ Nominee ”
IS i * j American version of the “ Candidate,”
St vj here long ago by the gorgeously-dolled-up
Maur—the man who established a claim on
public gratitude by causing Christie Murray to be
run m by a policeman who entered him on the
charge-sheet as “imperfectly educated”—and the
Candidate” was the English version of some-
thmg else which was the original French version
of itself. All three are the story of a man who
wanted to get away from his solemn home and his
tempestuous mother-in-law, and found a chance
when a fatuous party nominated him to stand for
some place or other where a man of his principles
would be received with bricks, the party pro-
bably regarding him as a politician whose loss
wouldn t be felt. Thereupon he sends his
secretary to personate him while he goes on the
whoop, and they
miss each other
coming back.
The Nominee
arriving alone
can’t give a
coherent ac-
count of himself
to his infuriated
parent, and
doesn’t know
that he has
abjured his prin-
ciples and been
elected as a flam*
ing friend of the
people, and so
makes state-
ments which are
afterwards ex-
plained away
with great diffi-
culty.

The “No-
minee” is
broader farce
than the other
version. Good-
win departs
avowedly to get
drunk and “ go
on a tear ” with
a strange female,
while the British
aristocrat left
out the female
and the drunk.
Further, Good-
win seems so
joyous in his
home that his
story about be-
ing a fatally-
bored man who
must depart in
search of liberty
loses a lot of its
force; when St.
Maur announced his resolve to flee from his
sad, starchy, stately mansion, where even a
card on a salver was brought in by eight
flunkeys, there seemed to be some reason in
his ambition, but seeing that the Nominee has
just got back from a razzle in the city, arriving
among the coals on a special engine at
his case doesn’t look such a very hard one.

. Nat Goodwin, so far as Sydney has yet
sized him up, is a bright and capable comedian
with a quaint habit of seizing his nose with his
finger and, thumb in moments of deep thought.
He doesn’t look at all. like the man that any
serious-minded party would nominate for any-
thing except a poker-school and a cocktail, but
then the party didn’t see him before taking this
rash step. Miss Maxine Elliott, the beauty
actress of the co., proves to be a large, ripe
charmer about whose loveliness there is no manner
of doubt whatsoever, though her acting has no
especial points about it. Her sister, Miss
Gertrude Elliott, is a quieter and more restful
style of beauty, and does her part with a less
overwhelming mass of hair but, possibly, with
more effect. That old-time favorite, Miss Emelie
Melville, and Miss Estelle Mortimer, as the
mother-in-law, are the strongest female elements
in the co., and the rest of the male part of it is
ordinary with a respectable ordinariness which
calls for no special objurgation. The beauty
actress does her best work as She in the curtain-
raiser, a very clever little episode of two,
which fills in time while the Nicest People
are clamoring in late and behaving like savages
generally. In this piece also Nat Goodwin
runs up against a orisis and seizes his nose as one
who fears lest that feature will bolt for happier
scenes.

“A Mother of Three,” Miss Clo. Graves’s
comedy which opened the Brough season at
Sydney Cri., is, so far as The Bulletin knows,
the New Woman’s first public attempt at stage
humor. It is by no means a bad attempt either.
The Three are the daughters of an astronomer,
but as the old man departed for Peru to observe a
transit of Venus before they were born, and re-
mained there for 18 years, apparently, as after-
wards appears, without getting his hair cut, they
have never seen him. The Three have one ball-
dress among them, a lodger who never pays up,
and numerous lovers who all drop off because they
don’t believe in the Peruvian parent and regard
the family as more or less fishy. Therefore, when
the trio are engaged for the fifth time their mother
dresses up in the clothes which were left behind
by the boarder who didn’t pay ujj —she also shakes
that defaulter in the passage- and proceeds to
guarantee the respectability of the family by
being a father. The wild-haired professor comes
dreaming home from Peru just here, therefore the
girls, after a long deficiency of male pro-
genitor, have no mother, and no less than two
fathers —one who is convulsed with horrible
suspicions upstairs, and represents himself as the
new boarder, and one in spectacles who cooks the
dinner in the kitchen, and abstractedly knits a
stocking, and wants to conduct a visiting gorgon
upstairs and help her off with her things. There
is much violent collision between the two, and-the
new father defends herself with a poker against
a sea of troubles, and is scorned by the old father
on suspicion of being the person who has led her-
self astray from the path of rectitude, and is
ordered to produce herself or take the conse-
quences. Signs appear here and there that the
play is the work of an inexperienced hand ; there
are loose ends about it, and it drags a little in Act
11., and the new father has an occasional tendency
to warnder into hazardous by-paths about under-
clothing, but it is bright and fresh, and amusing

and novel. The novelty lies partly in the fact
that, in the ordinary man-comedy, men pre-
dominate, and all the really amusing parts are
written for them. Here, instead, there are four
heroines and no very prominent hero, and, in
the first act, the ladies of the co. have the stage
almost entirely to themselves. The result is
decidedly interesting.
* * * *
Mr. and Mrs. Brough, as the old father
and the new one, are the wildly farcical elements
of the play, and both do it all the justice it can
expect. So do Titheradge and Miss Watt-
Tanner. Majeroni makes his first appearance
m a distinctly comedy-part as a long mili-
tary youth with a stutter, and in a quiet, un-
pretentious _ fqshion he is very successful. The
Three consist of the ever-welcome Miss Hardy
and the two new ladies, Misses Lilv Titheradge
and Winifred Austin, who both fill their characters
remarkably well. Miss Titheradge especially pro-
mises to be as clever as she is pretty, and should
maintain the credit of the family in years to come,
after her talented father has retired to dream
among his daffodils and orchids down in Ascot
Vale. Various other people --notably Miss Temple
as the orphan slavey with a chronic cold—fill their
various parts satisfactorily, and in a general way
things go smoothly and well.

The drama with the infuriated horse-race
in it is doing sufficiently well at Sydney Royal,
and its successor is not yet announced. The next
production, when it comes along, will probably be
“ For England,” the play which Bland Holt and
Alfred Woods reached for each other’s scalps
about in the law-courts, with the result that
Bland’s hair proved the more firmly fastened on of
the two.

Her Majesty’s is doing a week’s rest, but
on Saturday William Cosgrove appears as manager
of this gilded hall of misfortune, with “Fun on
the Bristol.” Cosgrove plays the widow, and the
probable feelings of the widow about being played
by Cosgrove will be expounded in next issue.
Anyhow, Her Majesty’s is a big handicap on a
play which is only an airy trifle in two acts. A
theatre of its bulk seems intended by nature for
the eight-act drama with tanks and elephants in it.

The coming and going of Rickards’ attrac-
tions at Sydney Tivoli grows bewildering. It is
only a week or so since the Frantz acrobatic
family reluctantly tore itself away, and now it is
back again, along with Provo, who is always
coining and going, and the strident Florrie Forde,
and various others. The Music Hall also keeps
alive, but there is nothing of an unusually astound-
ing character on its bill.

“ A Trip to Chinatown” booms as usual
at Melbourne Princess’, six nights per week and
twice on Saturday. Most of the songs continue
to result in an encore on slight provocation, also
the alleged humor of the dialogue and business
remains popular, probably because it is soft
and reminiscent of the nigger show which age
cannot wither. The emphatic and uninterrupted
success of “ A Trip of Chinatown ” triumphantly
refutes the doctrine that Australians have no re-
verence for old institutions. The calumny in
question falls dead in the presence of comedian
Conor (we don’t overlook his really new and funny
thermometer business) when, after divesting him-
self of a bird-cage, a portmanteau, an ulster, and
six under-coats of ifiany colors, he reels off a series
of corner-man “gags” without any prompting
from an interlocutor. As for such items as
the Quaker duet, Patrice’s legend of the art-
less girl who stole her johnnie’s timepiece, like-
wise the Italian opera travestie, the exquisite
drollery of sitting on a hot stone, and the “coon
chorus character of “keep a-inching it along”—
all these things, and many others, amount to a
senes of rejoicings over the aforesaid calumny’s

Frank Cates has been described as an

Frank Cates. In the (Shakespearian sense of the
phrase this was a player who could not “ force a
passion to his own conceit,” seeing that his own
conceit or self-consciousness was so much stronger
than his best attempts at stage passion. Never-
theless, Cates averaged a good salary for manv
years, and should have been able, with only a little
regard to economy, to pay his way to the last He
possessed a lucrative property in his clean-cut
features, young figure, and gentlemanly, though
not graceful, deportment, for managers can-
not easily procure practised stage - walkers
who have the same air of “good breeding”
that Frank Cates presented. The poor fellow
got a good deal of financial nourishment one
way and another, from his few drops of
blue blood. He was aggressively Hinglish, a
contemptuous belittler of, and an inveterate blas-
phemer at everything Australian. The scores
and hundreds of women who in days of yore wor-
shipped I rank Cates from the auditorium, and
thought of him as a darling man whom they would
like to befriend will be sorry to hear that he was
buried by the Yic, Distressed Actors’Fund which
excellent charity had been helping to support his
motherless family for some time before his death.
Many former female admirers have here an oppor-
tunity to pay a tribute of respect to their own
emotions, and the Distressed Actors’ Fund will be
glad to receive subscriptions, no doubt.

Considering the large number of life-assur-
ance offices in Australia when compared with population,
and the cutthroat competition which ensues, and the fact
that this competition keeps up expenses to a disastrous
point, and that, despite all efforts, several offices have
shown a gradually declining business for some years past
—considering all these things, there is urgent heed for a
process of amalgamation among the smaller concerns
which will reduce six offices into three, or two, or even
one. There is no difficulty worth speaking of about the
mere mechanical process of amalgamation. If two
mutual societies agreed to unite all they need to do is to
decide which name should be retained and which should
be dropped, to hump their books and papers into the
more commodious office of the two, unite the two staffs
of agents, sack a large amount of needless clerk, secre-
tary, director, &c., and go ahead. The funds of the
smaller concern would be kept in a separate account and
separately invested until all its customers had died off,
but no new policies would be issued in its name. All the
combined new business of both offices would be done in
the name of the other society—the one whose name was
to be preserved. In the course of years, when the cus-
tomers of the smaller office had all dropped off, the amal-
gamation would complete itself, and the business which
now requires two expensive sets of offices, managers,
clerks, directors, auditors, advertisements, medical
advisers, &c., &c., would be conducted equally well with
only one, and much expense which now runs away with
the policy-holders’ profits would be saved.
The only real difficulty in the way is that life
insurance offices exist largely to find billets and salaries
for managers, directors, and the rest. The policy-holders
3an’t- easily move in the matter; they are many and
widely scattered, and no one of them has enough interest
to make it worth while setting the matter in motion.
And if it was set in motion the managers and directors
and others, who live by keeping superfluous offices
afloat, would. probably gather up proxies enough
—from the kind of policy-holder who signs proxies
when he is asked to do so without enquiring
how. they are to be used—to vote down any such
proposal. Nevertheless, amalgamation would do a lob of
good in this over-insured country by reducing working
exs. to a reasonable figure. It is mainly too many sets of
offices, and offices’ staffs, and managers, and so on, which
make the smaller concerns “blew” about a quarter of
their premiums in salaries and oilier charges, and, if this
outlay could be reduced to a reasonable figure, it would
be an immense saving to the policy-holders. There is no
real reason why a second A.M.P. society, with all the
rigor and prestige of the present one, shouldn’t be created
in Australia by a union of sundry smaller offices which
maintain their separate existence in these depressed times
without much benefit to anybody.

The present chances seem to be thatM’Oracken’s
Brewery Co.—which is asking the English holders of
£500,000 worth of debentures to reduce interest from 4J
to S per cent. —won’t get the concession it is looking for.
The concern lost £22,900 last year, and as the proposed
reduction would only save £7500 a year, it is obvious that
it wouldn’t do much good unless thing's improved. Pro-
bably all it would do would be to keep the tiling suffi-
ciently alive to go on depreciating so that the debenture-
holders’ security, which is none too good at present,
would have time to grow a lot worse.

In Maoriland, a compulsory Civil Service in-
surance scheme has lately been started which ought to be
a vast improvement on the Superannuation-Fund swindle.
Every public servant appointed after the passage of the
Act has to insure in the State Life Insurance Department
on a plan which provides that, if he should die before 60—
the statutory age of retirement—his heirs receive the
amount of the policy with profits, and, if he should sur-
vive that age, he receives an annuity for the remainder of
his life. If he retires or is retrenched before the age of
60 he can either continue his policy or get a liberal
surrender value, as he pleases. The policy is abso-
lutely protected against all creditors, and, so long as
the officer is _in the service, it cannot be pawned,
mortgaged, assigned, or diverted from its purpose in any
way whatever. The system covers a lot of things. It
provides a hard-and-fast contract which no political influ-
ence can modify. The insured has—as he should have —
the best security which can be obtained ; when the State
compels any person to insure it is morally bound to give
him its own security for payment of ins policy. The
superannuated public servant can’t be left penniless, how-
ever much he may try to reduce himself to that condi-
tion. The country is saved a larg'e outlay for pensions.
The system doesn’t, like the N.S.W. Superannuation
swindle, leave the family wholly unprovided for in case of
premature death. Also, it gives cheap as well as safe
insurance; the Treasury collects the premiums by deduc-
tion from salaries, and all the heavy expenses for commis-
sion, &c., are saved. This is the sort of scheme which
Premier Reid should have initiated when the system of
compulsory contribution to the Superannuation Fund was
abolished, but then N.S.W. has no State-guaranteed Life
Office, and G.H.R. lacked the courage to create one.
By the way, when the system of compulsory
subscription to the N.S.W. Superannuation Fund was
abolished, it was announced that all new appointees to the
Civil Service must insure their lives in some office approved
by the Commissioners, or somebody. Has anyone heard
since then what offices have been approved of, or has
nothing been done in the matter? It would be interesting
to know what kind of offices are approved in this connec-
tion.

Considering all the loose vociferation there has
been of late about the way N.S.W. was scooping the Wes-
tralian trade from Victoria through the blessings of Free-
trade, and how Sydney was becoming the distributing
centre of Australia, some recent figures are interesting.
In 1895 the Vic. exports of merchandise only (not coin) to
W.A. were £593,000, or £153,000 more than in ’94. The
same year N.S.W. exports to W.A. were £143,000, or only
£60,000 more than in ’94. In view of a recent statement
which Max Hirsch permitted somebody to make in his
paper, that for one case of boots which went to W.A.
from Melbourne ten went from Sydney, it is further in-
teresting to note that Vic. boot - exports were £6243,
against £5441 from N.S.W.

For the year ended 31st March, 1896, there
passed through the Maoriland Public Trust Office £614,000,
and the working expenses of the office, including land-tax
and losses on securities, were a little under £15,000.
When private trustees or private trust companies can
show absolute security combined with an expense-rate of
less than 21 per cent., then The Bulletin' will stop
arguing in favor of the Public Trust system.

The haughty gas-man has been humbled in
Launceston, Tas., which city now claims to have the best
system of municipally-owned electric-lighting in this
hemisphere. In addition to the street lighting, in less
than five months upwards of 5000 private lights have
been applied for, and, as a consequence, the local gas co.
is the most subservient and polite institution ever heard
of. Canvassers for the erstwhile monopoly are instructed
to stick at nothing in order to place gas cooking-stoves
with householders, and far-seeing landladies are daily ex-
pecting their former take-away-your-meter autocrat to
offer a month’s free tucker with a gas-cooker.

be tamer when the City Corporation’s electric-lighting

several well-known experts, who, it is said, all declared

That in the working of the Fort Bourke mine at

its own, paid 15s. a ton for crushing many thousands of
tons for a 50% extraction, and sold what seems to be the best
claim on the belt for £lO,OOO. None the less, in selling
the Fort Bourke, the owners did the best thing for the
district. They had long shown their inability to do any-
thing better with it themselves. The sale has introduced
cyanide, brought lots of capital into the district, and,
with the wonderful development at the Peak, has made

As soon as Col. Cecil Morgan had departed, the

What seems a momentous discovery has been
made at Woods Point (Vic.) : three gold-bearing reefs all
within 100yds., traced for over two miles. The eastern
reef shows 7ft. of quartz, carrying gold from wall to wall,
and giving splendid prospects. The middle reef is 4ft.
wide, and also has good gold, and the western reef is of
dyke formation, with coarse gold in solid stone.

That famous parcel of 400 oz. Westralian gold
which proved to be 3900 z. base metal and only lOoz. of
the real article is not, it now appears, a solitary instance,
nor is it even the worst instance. Various other parcels
have proved to be adulterated, the best sample being. 90
per cent, bogus, while the worst ones were 99 and a fraction
per cent, iron and brass, and less than one per cent,
gold. This last fetched ninepence per ounce. As these
great collections of iron filings are exported as the real
metal they are included in the “gold” returns of the
Great Bogus Land, and must help to swell them con-
siderably.
One would not, of course, expect chemically-
pure gold from a mine worked by Cherubim and managed
by Seraphim. Virgin gold of very high quality has been
found in Victoria—so high as £4 4s. 3d. per ounce in value
—but chemieally-pure gold is worth £4 ss. an ounce. Bal-
larat gold might fetch £4 3s. 6d. an ounce, Bendigo about
the same. Some of the Gippsland product might be worth
£1 less. This only means that gold invariably contains
some alloy. The adulteration is always there, though
generally its quantity is of little consequence. But what
about “gold” that goes ninepence an ounce? How ever
did such “gold” come to be forwarded from Westralia
to Melbourne to be coined ? The fact that it has
been done in case after case adds a new terror to mining
speculation in the West. Was it merely a ruse to rig the
market, so that those in the know could unload
their shares ? Even The Bulletin is inclined to
doubt that so diabolical a dodge has been practised even
in Westralia. There are some undoubtedly curious dis-
turbing influences in Westralian mining. Several mines
produce very dirty gold that fetches from £2lss. to £3 ss.
per ounce. This low quality seriously interferes with
profits. The reason for the poverty of the gold is only
left to conjecture. The probability is that some mines
are attempting to deal with low-grade pyritic and other
such ores by melting instead of smelting them. The dif-
ference may not look much in print to the casual reader,
but it means a lot in fact.

H. L. Goodman, chairman of the Westralian
Gold Districts Trading Syndicate, is reported as hav-
ing told his shareholders at a London meeting that
they might expect to do good business, as the
population of W.A. was now increasing at the rate
of a quarter-of-a-million a year. The syndicate had
secured many monopolies, most of which he kept secret,
but whispered gently that the boss one was the agency of
Bass’s beer ! Their name had so spread over the country
that “ prospectors had offered them mines of surpassing
richness for flotation, not having the capital to work them
themselves ! ” Then Mr. Goodman proceeded to enumer-
ate the merits of the Ore Automatic process as a money-
making machine. “It will cost only a few pounds to
erect, and the ore can be reduced to the finest powder at a
cost (to us) of sixpence a ton. Just you realise this fact.
Even if we charge a royalty of only ss. a ton, we will
save every co. using it 10s. to 14s. a ton, and will
make an enormous revenue ourselves. As soon as I
heard of this remarkaDle process, I hastened to
acquire a personal interest in it for my own
benefit, and, in the second place, to secure for this
corporation the first claim on the Western Australian
rights.” (In the second place is good.) “ There are now
over 600 companies working mines in W.A., so if we
charge an initial fee of £lOOO each for the use of this pro-
cess, that will mean £600,000. Add to this a royalty of
ss. per ton, and you can fairly estimate the value of this
concession. Now, what did we pay for these rights?
Expert judges have estimated that we paid from a
quarter of a million to a million of money. I .am pleased
to say we have secured the rights for'l2o,ooo ordinary
shares, 600 deferred shares, and only £30,000 cash.” The
Bulletin seriously wants to know if there is any place in
the whole world outside of London where a man can talk
like that without being killed on sight ? His speech was
“ cheered at frequent intervals ! ” And yet we are fond
of the good old mother country. Perhaps it is our mother
country’s milk we are so fond of.

Of the General Gordon, W.A., a well-known
mining man writes “ Too much has been made of this
show. Take my word it is not nearly so rich as the public
have been led to think. There are some wonderfully good
stringers in the formation, but the bulk only samples
about an oz. to the ton, and under existing conditions
there are no divs. in that. We look to the eastern papers
to furnish mining humor. Lately we had it that ‘the
General Gordon would start crushing in Sept.; now, early
in October. Possibly it will start before the end of
the year; probably not. The mine is surrounded by
some very wild ‘ cats.’ The boom was well worked
up, and under the impression that the rapid share-
premiums of the Gordon would be repeated, they
were rushed, and most of these ‘ cats ’ were largely over-
applied. Knowing their intrinsic worthlessness, the local
subscribers were out as soon as the market began to drag.
Now the cats are all at a discount. By the way, Ex-
tended General Gordons, said to have been over-applied
for to the extent of 40,000, are selling at 2s. 2d.—a drop of
3s. on the amount paid—and calls are a certainty.”

A movement was started in Coolgardie recently
to disprove the assertions made by the Age and Sydney
D.T. special commissioner re the "salting of W.A. "mines
and the unanimity in lying practised by a big crowd of
mining-experts to. take down the British public. Great
faith was at first placed on what the Argus man was
going to say, but it is now found that, in the main, he
has confirmed the other. The move to knock out “ Our
Systematic Slanderers” has collapsed. It has been de-
cided to treat the allegations with (good old wheeze !)
“silent contempt.” In the same issue of a W.A. paper
which shrieks over this business appears a speech made in
London by Thompson, chairman of the Coolgardie
Chamber of Mines, in which he defends the Coolgardie
mining-experts and blames the London promoters. The
Coolgardie expert had to submit to great temptations,
and the anxiety of the promoter for “good reports” was
frequently expressed. Thompson gave one instance of
what has often happened. He went under instructions to
examine a mine. The owners had an idea, after he had
sampled, that he was not going to advise purchase. They
started to pu up. He replied, “I am afraid not.” They
offered £IOOJ if he would. His reply was that he did not
make money that way. They then offered £2OOO, and,
finally, £3OOO. The purchase price was £7OOO, and, as he
still declined to recommend it, they asked what he really
thought the show was worth. He replied : “No more in
hundreds than you are asking thousands.” “Then,” said
they, “you can take it at"£7oo.” The writer wonders
what percentage of the ex-land-bank men, land-agents,
and broken-down brokers (now fully-fledged W.A. mining
expertsl would refuse to accept £3OOO for recommending
a mine ?

Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie papers have started
to tell the cold-blooded truth of the mines in each other’s
districts. “ When newspapers fall out,” &c. Says a Cool-
gardie special who had been over to the Kalgoorlie races :
“Is it not strange, after all the strikes which the local
boomsters have telegraphed far and wide, that there are
only three mines with batteries giving regular returns ?
What are they doing with the innumerable Golcondas ?
If the Hannan’s belt, as it is fondly called, is four miles
wide and fourteen miles long, how is it that at the end of
two years there are not at least 30 mines crushing ? As a
matter of fact, there is just as great an average of duffers
at Kalgoorlie as anywhere else on the fields.” Now, the
much-abused present writer never said of W.A. anything
worse than this or more truthful.

delightful picture of our future prosperity,” says a Perth
paper. “ The time is at hand when we shall count our
gold, not by hundreds of ounces, but by hundreds of
tons.” As each hundred tons will be worth 14 mil-
lions the country should soon get out of debt. Four
batteries, said the gallant “ capting,” had cleaned up that
week for an average of to the ton. Still harping
on the Boulder group ! Anyhow, they gave this expert a
gun !

4s. lOd. ? Has the £lOO,OOO been received for the Mari-
tana ; and if not, what has become of the mine, concern-

One big Westralian dry-crushing plant is a
monument of bad British engineering. Breaking a butter-

The Bulletin thinks the time has arrived when
it should tip something. A dozen times a week the writer
is tempted to become a tipster. His t'p is not advice to
buy shares at about 3s. a dozen that are not worth as
many farthings ; it is to locate the new London boom in
Australian mines. If there is enough boom left in the
good old mother land, after handling hundreds of Westra-
lian “cats,” the new boom will be in the Northern Terri-
tory. Already several W.A. exploration companies are
looking to that part of Australia so as to divert attention
from the cats of W.A. Old returns from Pine Creek
are being resurrected, and the cry will be “ abundance of
water and timber, and every prospect of working cheap
labor in a tropical country.” The great W.A. boomsters
must do their utmost to"change the locale. Bull’s faith
and purse are unlimited. Yes, Tue Bulletin 1 says to all

News comes that China is to have a go at
systematising her currency. At present, its meejum of
exchange bears the same resemblance to a civilised money-
system as a marine-store does to an observatory. It har-
bors no less than six “ dollars,” most of which are in a
deplorable state of mutilation, owing to the practice oi
“ shrof-tnarking.” These dollars are the Japanese Trade
(420), Japanese yen (416), Hongkong (416), British (416),
Mexican (416£), Carolus (414)—the figures in brackets
being the nominal weight in grains. “ Shrof-marking”
has some resemblance (only more so) to the deceased
custom which made bank-notes suffer endorsement from
each successive holder. In China, every merchant who
gets hold of a dollar punches his chop or shrof on its un-
fortunate face, with a brass stamp and a hammer. A dollar
that has been the rounds looks like a debauched lottery-
ticket. These mangled dollars are made to have some
remote and mystic relation to taels, and also to shoes
(ingots) of silver. What is a tael? Well, there is the
Hailuvan tael, the Amoy tael, the Chefoo tael, the Wuhu
tael, the Foochow tael—and so on ad infinitum. Further,
in many districts custom makes a tael mean a tael plus a
percentage. In other districts there is a discount just as
unreasonable. The cash or li of the common people are
nominally 1000 to the tael, or one of the taels, but the
market decides in favor of 1500 to the tael, or 1779 to the

China’s currency system forms a curious commentary on
Herbert Spencer’s contention that governments should
not interfere in the currency, and that if they had not in-
terfered a world’s currency would have been evolved by
this time. In China the government has not interfered
with the currency, and, in consequence, it is a Chinese
puzzle.

“ Gaol-warders should have shorter hours,’’
says Prendergast, Victorian M.L.A.; “as it is,
they have no time to see their wives in daylight.”
This latter hardship wants a deal of thinking over.
There are so many wives who look so much better
by candle-light that it is difficult to be quite sure
whether the arrangement is cruelty or not. How
many homes which might otherwise have been
happy have been burst up through the parties
seeing each other by daylight, when the old man’s
bald patch looks large and bare and glabrous, and
the old woman’s crow’s-feet enlarge so that it
looks as if a condor had been walking on her face ?
Besides, a gaol-warder—especially if he has any-
thing to do with the flogging and hanging depart-
ment —ought only to be seen under the softening
influences of moonlight.

One morning last week the death of a
member of a family in very moderate circum-
stances was advertised in the Sydney daily papers,
yet by 10 a.m. the friends of deceased had received
a dozen samples of memorial-cards, seven under-
takers had submitted quotations, two well-known
town drapery-firms had forwarded prices for
mourning -requisites, three monumental-masons
had left business-cards, and four florists handed
in their price-lists ; also cabmen kept calling all
day asking if their services were likely to be
needed at the funeral. To crown all, a caterer
offered to provide a post-funeral gorge at so much
a head, and a town hotelkeeper—anticipating a
possible wake—sent his bottle-department list.

It nas always been drummed into N.S.W.
State-school teachers that they are to take notice
of nothing re the schools that may appear in the
papers, but are to await advice on the matter from
the Education Department. Many a teacher has
been disciplined for closing when a holiday has
been gazetted for the district, and no notice has
been forthcoming from the authorities. On such
occasions it was vain for the poor teacher to plead
that it was a public holiday, and that all local
Govt, offices were closed. He was always told,
“You should have waited for the Minister’s
authority,” and was cautioned “not to take notice
of anything in the papers. So the other day
when the retrenchment-notices were published m
the dailies, the dutiful teachers, not having re
ceived official intimation of the reduction of their
salary, and remembering the oft-repeated caution,
promptly sent in their abstracts on their original
salary-basis—unretrenched—and anxiously awaited
results. P.S. —They got there just the same.

a teacher being seated while giving a lesson
—indeed, in some few (favored) schools
specially-constructed “thrones” are pro-
vided for the teacher’s use—but in the
majority of schools the harassed teacher is
compelled to stand and is reported if found

At Maitland (N.S.W.) hospital, the other

for tumour without a consultation of the surgical

It was at a committee
meeting of a Maternity Hos-
pital in one of the Austra-
lias, and before a score or so
of intensely respectable mid-
dle-aged sassiety women was
arraigned a girl who desired
to avail herself of the insti-
tution’s aid. “ Young wo-
man,” remarked the chair-
woman, a near connection of
the local Anglican bishop, in
severe accents, “this appli-
cation says you are married.
Are you sure that is the
case?” “Of course I am,”
responded the applicant ;
“me and Billy was married
by Parson Smith.” “I am
afraid you are telling me
an untruth, young woman,”
said the great one, adjusting
her spectacles carefully so as
to observe every movement
of the girl’s face “ there
is no clergyman of the name
of Smith in the'diocese.”
“Oh, ain’t there; he’s got
the Wesleyan Church at
Bongong,” snapped the pro-
spective mother. “Enough!”
unguardedly sneered the ec-
clesiastical lady—“a Wes-
leyan!” “ Yes,” yelled an-
other member of the com-
mittee, waving her bulky
umbrella and forgetting her
dignity for the moment,
“ and I was married by a
Wesleyan and I’m just as
legally married as you are !
You and your Church of
England ! Indeed ! ” And
the young woman who had
loved her lord so well swept
from the room with her application granted and
grinning in her sleeve.
A great crowd of the Nicest People rolled
up at the wedding of Scot Inglis and Miss Ida
Hamilton in a Sydney church last week, with
the result that the tabernacle was strewn
with back hair, squashed bonnets, frills, hair-
pins, and whalebone. The reserved seats
were rushed, and all the attempted regula-
tions trodden underfoot. About 600 people stood
up on the book-boards and held on to each other’s
hair. One stout lady, who was too ponderous for
such balancing feats, remained on the floor and
saw nothing, and an agile female behind put one
foot on her bonnet to maintain her balance. Then
the stout lady indignantly got from under and the
agile one fell heavijy. There was so little room
for the happy pair that during the ceremony two
Nice People were standing on the bride’s train at
once. The church was a heaving mass of jabber
and suffocation. In the gallery the people who
came very early got front seats and leaned on the
rail, and the people who came late feather-bedded
themselves up against these early people and
squashed them fiat. Everybody was breathing in
somebody else’s ear, or resting his tongue on the
top of somebody’s hat while he gasped. The
communion-table had more people on it than
it could hold, and every time an anguished
female fell off she fetched some of the next
woman’s clothes with her, till it began to
be an open question whether part of the
crowd wouldn’t go home undressed. When
the show was over and the mob started out,
many small women were taken off their feet
and didn’t find them again for yards, and the
shoes of some of them dropped off while they
were suspended, and there wasn’t one untrodden-
on corn in the whole assemblage—the only safe
plan was to wear rational costume and come out
upside-down, and no one thought of that.
Altogether the Nicest People had a real good

time, and so had the mob that blocked the street

The charity outrage on “The Parvenu,”
at baronet Clarke’s big Melb. house, was a
thoroughly practical affair. A first performance
drew a crowd of 900 or so—as many as the ball-
room would hold —at 7s. 6d. per head, and the show
was repeated later in the week at the popular
price of three “ bob. ” The Clarke dancing saloon,
fitted with a deep stage, elegantly framed, makes
a very good theatre. Cliveden concert-room,
despite its classical air, is less imposing than the
“old English” hall, with its ancestral armour,
stags’ antlers, open fireplaces, and what not.
Apropos of statuary, the Australian small boy
puts his own practical construction on undressed
marble “figgers.” A guest questioned the scion
of one of the “ stately homes” of Melb. concerning
a nude in the family collection. “ It’s Aunt J. !”
was the prompt reply, to the horror of his maligned
relative, a well-nourished spinster of conspicuous
modesty.

The Westralian metropolitan dailies are
sparing no pains to persuade the people into a
taste for tinned dog, roupy fowls, and unseason-
able fish, in preference to tuberculous and
cancerous beef. A large section of the
community does not, however, appre-
ciate the grimness of the situa-
tion, and declares that cancer
has been present for the last
40 years in the province’s ox-
meat. Also it remarks that,
having dined for 40 years off
tuberculous beef, it has got
used to tubercles, and is
willing to dine off similar
disease and corruption for
the next 40 years. Likewise,
this fine, old-fashioned section
explains that though fairly
extensive tuberculosis may
cut off the bullock in his
prime, and malignant disease
may eat its way into all his
tissues, and pleuro-pneu-
monia the latest trouble
among W.A. cattle—may carry them off in vast
numbers, the community is still willing to eat
tuberculosis, cancer, pleuro, and all other diseases
so long as it can have bullock, which is the flesh
beloved of its soul.

Melb. Argus has been trying to excite a
correspondence on the probably bogus, and utterly
stupid, subject of a young man who admires a
young woman, and not being able to get a formal
introduction to her, would like to know what to
do in the matter. Letters to the editor, pro-
fessedly written by blushing spinsters, advised
the young man to strike up an acquaintance, with
a brother, cousin, or platonic friend of the
divinity, and get at her that way. Other in-
genuous suggestions were in favor of a gallant
encounter in the street, the young man to touch
his Heart’s Desire gently on the elbow, saying,
“ ’Souse me ! ” etc. One writer thought if the
maiden were a cyclist it would be well for her
adorer to buy a bike, and follow her everywhere
until she fell off and needed picking up by the
ardent stranger, at whom she would straightway
wink the other eye of encouragement. Then some
aged matrons weighed in with the advice that
poor Romeo should write a “ manly, straight-
forward ” letter, explaining the state of his feelings
as far as he could judge them up to date. The
Argus correspondence was very tiring. Any

AUTUMN LEAVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The leaves of Autumn, shrinking
Brown and faded on the trees,
Start a thoughtful fellow thinking
Of the many gilds he sees
Who did spread a careless mesh
Whilst their charms were young and fresh ;
Who frightened birds by winking,
Or by flashing too much flesh.
They must muse o’er chances missed,
They must dream of kisses kissed
When the Springtime sun was sinking,
And the busy buzzing bees
Flying blindly with the breeze
Told, in never-ceasing humming,
Of the ardent summer coming,
And warned them to remember how
A woman’s beauty flees.
Ah ! the cynic rather grieves
For those withered Autumn leaves.
I found Belinda weeping
In the Austral month of May.
Bell sowed, and she is reaping
Crops of sorrow, lack-a-day !
Once her form was plump and green
Which is now so dry and lean,
And waking, dozing, sleeping,
She was happy and serene.
Did she think of vanished hours,
Of my true-love gifts of flowers
When my verdant heart was leaping
For the word she wouldn’t say?
Well, I coughed and went away.
In the time of adoration
I’d have offered consolation,
But I viewed that spinster weeping
With a comical dismay.
Tears dropped gently on my sleeve
As I took an Autumn leave.

sick wife under the pretence of nursing her, what mercy
did he deserve ? Taking your own view, Dean deserved
hanging as the law now stands ; and the fact that he was
not unconditionally convicted and carefully hanged is due
solely to the undue eagerness shown by Judge Win-
deyer for his conviction. Thus does any Judge who fails

Un-Artistic Artists.—Yell the Second.
“ When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden’s
green and gold,
Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a
stick in the mould ;
And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy
to his mighty heart,
Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, ‘ It’s pretty,
but is it Art ? ’ ”
Protests !! ! Naturally. Every honest
thought knocks the wind out of somebody, and
when he gets it back he starts howling. Was it
the con veil ient-for-quotation Dr. Johnson who
said this, and added that he never felt satisfied
with the articles that didn’t win him plenty of
abuse? If so, the thing has sense—not because
Johnson said it, but because it seems to the present
writer to have sense, and every writer is his own
ultima ratio.
* * * *
And “artists ” are tender. However their
bodies may fare, their minds are generally pam-
pered into luxurious self-satisfaction. The soul’s
lordliest pleasure-houses are built out of a tube of
01 1-color and an eigh teenpenny palette, and there th e
essence-of-the-artist sits and creates a new heaven
and a nevv earth to suit his whim, or his imagina-
tion, or whatever it is that squeezes the oil-color
on to the palette. And when some crude, objec-
tionable person throws a stone on the roof of the
pleasure-house the ar ist’s soul boils over as a
matter of course. What else could a self-respect-
ing soul do ?
* * * *
So it is objected that an “artist” cannot
get behind Nature : if he portrays Nature exactly
as she is he has achieved Art’s utmost. An ex-
ploded theory which The Bulletin dogmatist
delights in denouncing. Moreover, in practice
the artist denounces it himself. Here is B. E.
Minns outdaring Nokes and Stokes in azure feats.
In fad, or fancy, or fact, he sees Nature with a
purple glow on her, and his paintings glow with
purple. His “ Royal Exchange, London,” is
purple; so is his “ Aboriginal Female ” —an anti-
podal conjunction which goes to show that the
purple is in the artist rather than in his subjects.
(By way, that “ Aboriginal Female ”is a gem
of the Exhibition under notice, and largely because
she is considerably less purple than Minns’s other
aboriginal heads in Sydney Art Gallery.) But
the point is that Minns is not expressing Nature
as she is—or not, at all events, as she appears to
this critic and other average observers: he is
expressing Nature in terms of himself: he is
selecting and rejecting natural tints to make his
ideal color-harmony. Which he is perfectly justi-
fied in doing; though the onus rests upon him of
justifying his conception by his result—and this,
in his extremities of purple, he doesn’t do.
* * » *
There is no doubt that, so various and
continual are the changes in light and atmos-
phere and surroundings, every natural object
has at one time or another passed through
practically all the vicissitudes of color which
exist in the universe. On a thunderstormy
day, for example, a face may be green ; in flaring
sunlight it may be red ; moonlight can make it
“as yellow as a guinea.” But an artist, if he
understands his Art, will not deliberately seek
out outre lights and effects, because the es-
sential value of his Art is in its result on
the observer’s mind, and anything which
strikes the capable hormal observer as im-
probable, unnatural, lessens the force of that
result. There is a picture in the Exhibition—
“ The Old Bridge at Pyrmont (moonrise),’’ by D.
G. Reid —which is even more purple than Minns’s
pictures ; but its purple is natural and normal and,
therefore, Artistic. Everybody who crosses
Pyrmont Bridge in the evening must have noticed
the predominance of purple tints. But in
any ordinary light there is no purple tint
in an Australian aboriginal—or nothing like as
much as Minns shows ; and consequently to ordin-
ary observers his aboriginal pictures appear wrong
and untrue to the extent of his purple surplus.
I herefore, his Art is bad, for to a stranger he
would convey an entirely wrong impression of the
Australian aborigine.
* * » *
That is to say, that the idealisation of
Nature demanded from the Artist must come
along the line of probability : he must use his
imagination scientifically, especially if his picture
has value rather as a fact than as an idea. Minns’s
aboriginals have their chief value as facts :
as realistic representations to be handed down
to future times : and idealistic treatment of
them would spoil their truth and lessen their
value. But in J. H. Waugh’s pretty, dreamy
sketch of “ Calm ” nobody cares whether
he has copied a landscape exactly: with any other
landscape he might get the same charming effect.
“ Calm ” is one of the cheap and Artistic pictures
of the Exhibition : others are Alice Norton’s
“Remnants of Early Days,” and “Bulberaring
Lagoon ’’—pretty little glimpsy water-colors which
carry reality and conviction with them. That is
just what Frank Mahony’s “Sick Stockrider”
sketches do not, thanks chiefly to the lurid
coloring. Men and horses do not look like that
outside the “ Little Girl’s Own Painting-Book.”
Rightly considered, Mahony’s theme barred all
vagaries of color; he could not afford to idealise,
either ; what he had to do was to reproduce
Gordon’s vivid scenes as naturally and energeti-
cally as possible. He has the energy, but not the
truth.
* * * *
T. St. G. Tucker’s “ When Daylight Dies ”
is a pretty and harmonious picture; and it is Art
inasmuch as it is beautiful, and touches the eye
softly and musically, soothing rather than striking
the mind. And Norman McGeorge’s work grips
at once with its decision and truth; and Emily
Paul’s “Roses” are bright, and real, and well-
painted. Ethel Stephens’s flowers are as well-
painted, perhaps; but the uncolored wooden
panels are stiff and spoil the illusion. Her mis-
take is radical, since flowers, realistically treated,
can only be charming when alive; but Ethel
Stephens goes out of her way to show you that
they are. dead, and merely painted on a board.
Decorative, maybe ; but Art which is decora-
tive and nothing more is the lowest form
of Art—if indeed it be Art at all. Godfrey
Rivers’ work impresses by its neatness and
carefulness ; there is no inspiration in it, but
any amount of pains. Grace Joel’s “Youth” is
nice to look at, but one goes on and does not want
to return to it. And why ? Because, reiterating
the old saw, it is mere Nature—Nature not raised
to the Manth (or Womcintk) power. And that
will not pass for Art. The light on sea or land is
good enough in its way, but we want the light that
never was on sea or land. There is nothing in
Nature that the human mind cannot improve
upon. The most beautiful sunset is not as beauti-
ful as the fancy of the poet who watches it—
and an Artist must be a poet. The most impres-
sive scene in all history was not as great as the im-
pressive thoughts which it arouses in a genius con-
sidering it—and an Artist must be a genius. The
sweetest smile which plays in the eyes of a child is
not as sweet as the childish nature which gives
birth to it—and an Artist must be as a little child.
*•* . *
Child ! genius ! poet!—nice demands these
to make of the average “ artist ” ! Well, if he can-
not go all the way, he can at least go a little ; or,
if he cannot go a little, he can at least try to go a
little. But until he seems to try to go a little he
will not get The Bulletin’s vote. Now, Geo.
Lambert seems to try a little. In his “Bush
Idyll ” the goats are real goats, naturally
posed. But he has put too much in his pic-
ture, and his girl is growing out of a tree.
Arthur Streeton’s “Landscape ” is interesting be-
cause of the bulgy female figure in the right of
the canvas: she is exactly like a jieg-top. Who
invented the fiction that women are beautiful
creatures? And the same “artists ” “ Ilawkes-
bury Landscape ” is curious because of the large
expanse of blue-bag water in the foreground.
Two hundred guineas’ worth of such would last
the homely housewife an eternity. One would
much rather give guineas five for Will Kerr’s
“Jester ” —who has character enough to be worth
’em. And the question whether D. H. Souter’s
clever black-and-white drawings are Art with a
capital A must be postponed ; for The Bulletin’s
benediction upon the Society of Artists and
artists arrives just here.
A quaint horror is reported from Pahiatua
(M.L.), where a man is alleged to have been bailed
up on the road late at night, his-watch stolen, and
both his ears cut off. He is said to have been
more-or-less drunk at the time, and, as the man
arrested on suspicion is' a publican, it may be set
down to the Accursed Drink both ways. In fact,
it is a long time since there was a horror which
could be set down to Der-rink so effectually, and
if the ears—which haven’t yet turned up—are
found preserved in spirits, the moral will be com-
plete.
At Carlton (Melb.) police-court the other
day a publican was charged with allowing women
of bad character to assemble on his premises, and the
constable coolly swore that on entering the hotel
he found two prostitutes in the parlor. Cross-
examined by the defending lawyer the policeman
airily remarked that he “ only judged the women
to be prostitutes by their general appearance.”
The bench, by some extraordinary process of logic,
fined the. man <£2—but, upon notice of appeal
being given, the prosecuting sub - inspector
promptly asked permission to withdraw the
charge, smilingly admitting that the case wouldn’t
stand in the higher courts. How many police-
court decisions, especially in criminal cases, would
stand m the higher courts ?
An interesting description of a materiali-
sation performed by The Bulletin’s old acquaint-
ance, Mrs. Mellon, is given in the Aug. number of
the organ of Yic. spookery, This Would and the
Next. Forty people were present at the show,
which, judiciously, was held at the house of
another medium.. Mrs. Mellon invited an exam-
ination of the cabinet and surroundings, and then
“ a rosy-tinted glow ” was generated for the bene-
fit of sceptics. Mrs. Mellon sat in front of the
cabinet at first, and two female forms seemed to
appear, the medium being apparently in her nor-
mal. state and making occasional remarks. But a
falling walking-stick shattered her aura so much
that she was implored to go into the cabinet
Which she did, with the result that quite a “ Trip
to Chinatown ” procession of holy and unholy
ghosts, one of them with a wooden leg, waltzed
into existence :
Our old friend Cissy was amongst the visitors. She
came well forward from the cabinet, took a hand-bell
from the table and rang it vigorously. On being re-
quested to de-materialise she sank to the floor until only
her head and shoulders were visible. The form then
gradually rose until Cissy, fully developed, again stood
before us. At the conclusion of the materialisations
Cissy took control of the medium and entered into con-
versation with a learned Judge, who was present. An
interesting dialogue ensued between them, and if Cissy
did not tell us anything that was original, yet the rapidity
with which she answered questions and expounded Spiri-
tualism, as she knew it, was a surprise to those who had
often met her, but had never heard her in a prolonged con-
versation.
Who was the “learned Judge?” Casey is the
only Yic. Judge suspected of Windeyeresque curi-
osity.
At Poverty point.
Every married man should, as a matter of discipline,
take his wife to see Maxine Elliott and Nat Goodwin in
“ The Silent System ”at Sydney Lyceum. A more beauti-
ful satire on the deliberateness of the hysterical-jealous
woman who storms and snivels because the poor innocent
old man has stayed out late at the club was never seen.
A meeting' of married men will, it is said, be called by
private circular to organise a testimonial to Maxine Elliott
and Nat Goodwin aforesaid. By the way, the current
Lyceum bill gives the distinguished Yankee comedian a
fearful time. In “ The Silent System ” he has a 20-minutes
purgatory with his wife; in “The Nominee” he lias a
protracted sheol with his mother-in-law.
According to an Adelaide interviewer, Miss Ida Hamil-
ton told him that she judged a man by his necktie. Scot
Inglis must wear what the late Jimmy Allison would have
termed “ a necktie for the gods,” or perhaps his fair
young bride judges him by the marriage-tie, which is the
prettiest couleur de rose under Heaven.
Melba’s most favored male correspondent in Australia is
Charley Iluenerbein. When she was comparatively un-
known here it was Iluenerbein who discovered and raved
about the magical charm of her voice, and introduced her
everywhere as a coming prima-doiuia.
Earl of Shaftesbury was the only performer encored at
a recent Melb. fashionable concert. Superfluous. Little
Earl Rosewater went to Eton in golden shavings of curls.

here’s a kick for the duke and another for the earl.”

Shifter : “ Frank Cates, who died last week, after years
of misery, was, like Capt. Humphreys, too much of the
gentleman, in a Debrett sense, for the actor. Yet he was
a London amateur Hamlet, with Beerbohm Tree in an
inferior part. Always colorless, without the afflatus.
Cates, Carden, Collier, and Bentley have been the only
Melb. representatives of Irving’s Mathias, in ‘ The Bells.’ ”
On his wedding-night Scot Inglis played Beaus4ant, in
“ The Lady of Lyons,” at Sydney Lyceum. When foiled
in his desire to possess Melnotte’s wife, Beaus&mt sarcas-
tically wishes her “ a happy honeymoon.” As Inglis re-
peated the lines of the text, a gallery-voice chipped in,
“ The same to you, old fellow, and many of ’em.”
Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Kean acted “The Honeymoon,” the
night of their wedding, and it is said Kean had shortly
before been refused by Baroness Coutts. Mr. and Mrs.
Kendal acted in “As You Like It” on their wedding
night. Says a gallery man: “How do you like it,
Madge ? ” Madge : “ Don’t know yet.”
Haresfoot: “ Bellew’s Marat is falsely made up, and
more like Carrier, or one of those blood-boltered brutes
of the Revolution. Bcllew’s handsome lineaments,
coarsened, exaggerated about the mouth and eyes, and
the skin made" seamy, would give the Marat of the
portraits.”
How is that oft-repeated gag about the baldheads at the
theatre proved by a glance at the dress-circle of Melbourne
Opera House ! Nine-tenths of the men present any night
are over 45 years of age; the remaining tenth are princi-
pally Hebrews under 20.
Frank Cates was buried beside his wife, who died some
three years ago, in the “ actors’ corner ” at Melb. General
Cemetery. By the way, Cates, like all Gentile prodigals,
had a great “ down ” on the Chosen, wherefore ironical
fate decreed that his grave should be directly opposite a
Jew’s expensive tombstone.
The fascinating Mrs. Potter has left for the North,
taking with her Sydney’s best blessing. That Mrs. Potter
was a big draw is self-evident—she was a far bigger draw
even than Bellew, who played admirably, or Inglis, who
was fully as good as Bellew —in fact, she was nearly the
whole draw in herself, for, somehow or other, men and
women love to gaze upon Mrs. Potter, and even
those who revile her acting go to gaze upon her
again and again. The probable reason is that Mrs.
Potter’s acting is bad to the verge of genius;
her wonderful versatility enables her to act badly in
more different ways than any other actress The Bulletin
knows of. Even Bernhardt isn’t quite so versatile as Mrs.
Patter. Also, her affectations and artificialities are so
quaint and charming that, if the writer heard she was
going to act—and if he wasn’t a world-weary fragment
who has gone to the show three times a week for 10 years
—he would travel a considerable distance by gradual coal-
train to see her. And, even if the same b"las6 scribe was
dying, he would want to be carried into the show just
once more to see what kind of astounding hat Mrs. Potter
would wear next, and to wonder if he would see any hat
like it in the world to come. To sum her up, Mrs. Potter’s
charm apparently lies in the fact that, when she fails, she
fails in eerie ways that no one else would dream
of, so that it is a liberal education only to see her do
things wrong and wonder how she manages it. Probably
she W'ould have been as accomplished as she is “fetching”
had she begun at the bottom of the tree under some bright
dramatic tutor, and had been shaken frequently when she
was very young. As it is, the lack of being judiciously
shaken has made her only a diaphanous advt., and she
probably pays better as she is than she would any other
way.
Combining the phonograph with the cinematograph
the performances of Garrick, Kean, and Jenny Lind might
have been kept in amber. Thus 1996 may 'see and hear
Irving and Melba.
The police charge against the Sydney alleged X-rav

“ Exile ” gossips to Tiie Bulletin from London-—The
most recent professional arrival from Australia, Bertha
Rossow, really did create a little stir when, at a sin-in-
competition held at the Agricultural Hall (!) in connection
with the Musical Trades Exhibition, the judges after
listening patiently to nearly 50 different renderings of
the Jevvel song from “Faust,” presented her with the
grand piano offered as first prize. Some of the earlier
arrivals have already, unfortunately, become “ Angli-
cised,” such as Harry Fitts (Atkinson)-now a->ain run-
nmg in single harness-and Alfred Moul, long presiding
deity at the Alhambra, who has lately been decorated
by the I rench Republic with the Legion d’Honneur in
consideration of his efforts to provide amusement for the
public. This decoration is regarded in Paris in the lio-ht
of a huge joke, and is now held in just about as much
honor as an Australian J.P.-ship. Plumpton again hav
ing just recovered from a little iegai brush, lords it’over

Ada Crossley has made great strides since her appear-

extra Melba gathers in the bawbees to the extent of 120
guineas when she sings at an At-Home; hence it °s not
surprising she is content to stay where she is for the nre
sent, and let her compatriots wait. p
As for things Thespian Pattie Browne, oh so fat i
plays with all her old “verve ”in “ A Nisrht OnY ” fb
Seville, and here also Grace Lane wefl-known to
Melb. Johnmedom, does her little best in the' curtain
raiser. G. W. Anson was noticed wanderin-
what disconsolately, at the Oval when the Surrey ’match
was in progress. Ethel Hay don, still with a lot to learn
has a good part in “Mv Girl ” Opo..«•« i i ~i° leain >
the Gaiety ; and Charlie Ryley—whism it c-entlv—v, St at
fat part as the Vicar, quite a new role for thp h ?

Ethel Haydon plays close up to Ellaline Terris, who h!

Phelps is with Pattie Browne in “A Night but nvnu

Louis Brad held has to play a very “second fiddle ” to
Haydon Coffin in the same piece. Leedham Bantoek sals
a few words as a resplendent naval officer, while Blanche
Massey, in gorgeous raiment, walks in and out with ti e
other ornaments. Maud Hobson has a very small mr
and Decima Moore (and co.) is touring 'with Arthur
Roberts, who has returned, temporarily at any rate to his
old love, the variety stage, and is at present in the nro
vinces with a sort of monologue entertainment. 1
At a recent bal poudrd, one of the most obese not to
say massive, of songstresses came out dolled up’ kitten
fashion, and playfully accosted a local johnny, remarkin'.-
with a huge infantile smile, “Don’t you know me in tics
attire?” “Don’t I!” was the somewhat hazv *enlv
“ you are Lucy Chambers.” The johnny was somewhat
sobered by the sudden fainting of the lady ■ and no
wonder. Think of being taken for poor, dear defunct
Lucy, many years her senior, and whom none of’her thou-
sands of friends could ever have accused of anv excess ol
loveliness.
Colborne Baber, as previously announced, has visited
England to better herself musically. Her charming rival
Frances Saville, goaded her on to this end. Latest advices
show that she will study French opera under Marchesi.
Perhaps the nearest approach in Australia to the virile
vocal chords of the late Madame Pateyis to be met w t.’i
in the person of Mrs. Usher, of Sydney, wife of the prin-
cipal assistant at Paling’s. She possesses verv rich, melo-
dious contralto tones singularly massive in the’lower
register. The “ Evening Prayer ”in Costa’s “ Eli ”is an
item which best displays the contralto’s breadth of treat-
ment and offers most scope for the exercise of a pheno-
menal compass.
Marie Elster seems to have been well-liked in Dublin
where she was singing with the Neilson Opera Co. in June
and July. Press notices praise her performances, vocal
and dramatic, in “Faust,” “Daughterof the Regiment,”
and “ Oavalleria.” The Irish Times credits her with
“highly effective ” acting as Santuzza in Maseami’s
opera ; the Weekly Independent says she sang the li.ui-
tana music “ as it has seldom been sung of late years in
Dublin,” and the Evening Herald says that she “ won
the sympathy, &c., &c., by her excellent singing and act-
ing” in the heavy role of Leonora (“ Trovatore Nnt
bad for on e who had never played a grand opera part
right through, outside of Westralia, until she went ’Ome
12 months ago. Marie Elster married in her teens, and
has a full-grown daughter.

A recent amateur performance of “Sweet Lavender”
at Hawthorn (Melb.), in aid of the Ladies’ Benevolent So-
ciety, yielded Pill net profit from £152 total receipts.
This contrasts favorably with the Lyric Club “chanty”

Harrison White, pianist to Sydney Liedertafel, who is

It is his intention to put himself under Guilmant’s guid-
ance. Guilmant, the greatest living organist, will ~e
persuaded by Wiegand to give a few organ recitals on the
Sydney Town Hall instrument. Wiegand does not anti-
cipate much difficulty, provided musical Sydney will pay
a little more than sixpence for listening.
During the unprecedented amphitheatrie rush to “ China-
town,” Melb. Princess’, the management might open the

A certain curling-haired tragedian relates how he once
“had” an audience. “I was once—ha ! ha!—playing
Othello. I only played it once. Out all day—whisky -
more whisky—got to the theatre very late. In fact, only
just time to dress and get on. 1 ‘ made up ’ in a fiery
hurry, blacked my face and neck, and forgot all about
my hands. Othello entered—dark face, white hands.
Audience laughed, and when I found what they were
grinning at I got wild. The moment I got an exit I went
to my dressing-room, where I had a pair of flesh-colored
gloves. Then I blacked my hands, drew the gloves over
them, and walked on. Presently I had the stage to my-
self and when I knew the attention of the audience would
be fixed on me, I slowly drew off my gloves and exposed
the Moor beneath. For the rest of the performance, 1
tell you, that audience was as quiet as a peach. I got a
good notice in the morning paper, too, for my ‘attention
to minor details.’ ”
Ada Crossley, writing to a Melb. friend, says she hopes
to return to Australia within 12 mouths.
The Yaidis, Rickards’ new aerial gymnastes, are the
real tip-toppers. Even the Scientific American described
their apparatus in a long article.
Busker : “It is not correct that the Melb. suburban
dramatic commonwealths act low-class plays, as a rule.
Within the past three months they have acted ' East
Lynne,’ ‘ Private Secretary,’ ‘ Green Bushes,’ ‘ His
Natural Life,’ 1 Mixed,’ ‘ Arrah-na-Pogue,’ 4 Two Orphans,’
and maybe a dozen other pieces of equal calibre.’
Holdar M. : “ Isn’t it about time the 4 gaff was blown’
touching the sex of that skirt-attired person who excites
so much sterile admiration by feats of ‘feminine’ en-
durance ? ”
Crackles will go to the Firm for its Melbourne panto.,
but the Frantz Family, though said to be engaged for the
same show, will remain with Rickards at Xmas time.
Who remembers Horace Bent’s farce parodying “The
Vagabond’s” New Guinea expedition, in which H.B. mas-
queraded in a white helmet several feet in diameter under
the style of Julian Tomatoes? The “ Vag.” himself was
present the first night and was one of the most amused
witnesses.


GOING WITH THE TIMES.
How applicable this is to human life in the varioi
ups and downs ! The fierce struggle of compel
tion does indeed force knowledge m its higher
sense to the front. We see men moving ahe&t
steadily and surely ; and yet they are few, beoau&>
success means energy and determination, and tfc;
pluck and money expended to push commerce
along must be large and continuous. This draw,
attention to Mr. Saunders, the jeweller, George
street, opposite railway station. His magnificen
stock of watches in all grades and prices, chan
in gold and silver, beautiful brooches, bracelets,
handsome diamond rings for ladies, beautify
chased silverplate for wedding-presents, is markee
at prices to defy competition, as he sells direct froE;
the maker to the public. His stock and beautifully
fitted shop are well worth a visit. Call and judt
for yourself.*

In a matrimonial squabble the other day
at a Melb. suburban court, the parties had only
been married a week, and quarrelled over the
bride’s insistence on cycling.
Old friend Jules Joubert, working up
exhibition enthusiasm in Queensland, says an

If Queen Victoria survives till 25th of the
present month (Sept.) she will have reigned longer
than any other English monarch. George 111.
reigned 59 years 3 months and 4 days. Victoria
had reigned 59 years on June 20 last.
Melb. Australasian blames Frank Mason
for being over-anxious to avoid giving offence as
Chairman of Committees. Francis has been a
cautious man ever since the day he was suddenly
“ stoushed ” by Madame Lucy Chambers.
One of the first white men to settle on the
Lachlan below what is now known as Forbes died
last week, aged 67—Ernest Bowler, son of an old
Western pioneer, Major Bowler, who went over
the Blue Mountains and settled on Bathurst
Plains over half a century ago.
N. : “In a casual visit to Bishopscourt,
Melbourne, mansion of the Anglican prelates, I
noticed that the stairs were minus a number, of
bannisters. Significant of the three successive
bishops, Perry, Moorhouse, and Goe, being
married men without children.”
King Mahutu of Waikato (M.L.) is a pro-
hibitionist. His august father, Tawhaio Rex,
was a Chief Templar, and, moreover, wore the
blue ribbon of a suppositiously grogless life ; but
that did not prevent him having a breath strong
enough to intoxicate an exciseman.
Robert Davenport, who sat in the first
S.A. Leg. Council from 1851 to ’54, and who had
resided on his estate at “ Battunga,” near Mt.
Barker, for nearly 60 years, died this month, aged
80. His brother, Samuel Davenport, who still
lives, was a member of S.A. Leg. Council 50 years
ago.
Gov. Buxton, who favors the employment
of colored labor in the Northern Territory and m
tropical Australia generally, should be made learn
by heart the speeches of his philanthropic ances-
tor, the anti-slavery Thomas Fowell Buxton,
whose monument stands in one of the aisles of
Westminster Abbey.
A witness giving evidence in a divorce-case
before Windeyer, J., would persist in using jaw-
breaking words. “ I was present at the wedding,
your Honor,” said he, “and I saw the marriage
consummated.” “Hur-um,”remarked the Judge,
with a dry cough ; “ it is not usual, sir, to have a
witness to that ceremony.”
Latest advices say that Dr. Fiaschi will re-
turn to Sydney from the United States early in
October. The doctor penetrated as far as Kassala,
and had a good deal of surgical work there. After
revisiting his relatives at Milan, he visited the
London hospitals, and afterwards went to New
York to meet a celebrated American surgeon, Dr.
Murphy.
An aboriginal, doing “ two years’ hard ” in
Goulburn gaol, died the other day of consump-
tion. The medical officer, knowing the poor
blackfellow was dying, permitted him to have any
food he desired. The day before his death, our
countryman asked for baked ’possum, and his wish
was gratified. We all have our ideals.
Parson Bevan’s advice to Vic. politicians :
“If you believe in Freetrade teach Freetrade,,
even though you are kicked out of the House. ”

never accept); “If you believe in Christianity
teach Christianity, even though you are kicked

0. L. Meyer, Austrian consul, is also
chairman of the Adelaide Fire Brigades Board,
and he broke right up when asked, at the recent
Mayor’s ball, whether his
gorgeous red - and - white
uniform was attached to
the latter position.
Journalist : “I ad-
mired Sala and Julian
Thomas especially for their
humility, their painstak-
ing attention to detail, and
their unquenchable love of
justice. And a fine point
about the Vagabond was
that, though the Wes-
leyans got an unjust ver-
dict against him, it didn’t
affect his after-treatment
of them.”
Some method of de-
taching anoient limpets
from judicial and profes-
sional nooks is urgently
needed both here and in
England. The octogena-
rian scandal is common on
the English bench, and is
possible here ; and in an
Australian university one
professor clings tenaciously
to a salary of <£lsoo,
because the governing
body, while willing to give
him a, pension of <£7so,
refuses to allow <£looo.
The teaching result is
almost pitiable, and it is
to be feared that influence
and interest screen much
from the authorities that
should be known. The
instance is not a solitary
one either, if rumor re-
ports right. For want of
a better remedy, an age
for retirement should be
fixed and adhered to.
Many years ago J“ The Vagabond,” when
on a visit to Drouin (Vic.) got into an argument
on arrival with one M‘Lean, brother of Allen
M‘Lean, late Chief Secretary. M‘Lean had what
boxers call a “dirty left,” and it somehow got
introduced into the argument, with the result that
the “doubting Thomas” was badly disfigured.
In writing up Drouin, he made no mention of the
fight, merely stating that he “had been given
perhaps the warmest reception in his experience.”
Registrar Henry, of N.S.W. Insolvency
Court, sent bankrupt Hopley to gaol for seven
days last week for saying too often, when
under examination, “I don’t knovy; I don’t re-
member. ” Those who were present in Melbourne
Insolvency Court when Judge Noel sent gold-
digger Stubley to gaol for similar replies, and who
were sure at the time that the man was mentally
sick, as afterwards was proved, will resent the
exercise of this summary power by Judge or
Registrar.
A MOONLIGHT EPISODE.
TOM: “ Say, Maria, these folks must think we've been getting married!”
Lord Belmore, who is exciting himself in
the English Lords over the cession of Norfolk
Island to N.S. Wales, exhibited interest, when
N.S.W. Governor some 30 years ago, in that small
dependency only to the extent of rivetting liquor-
prohibition on the lonely inhabitants. He was
not a prohibitionist himself, either in theory or
practice, but he presented prohibition as the first
and last act of government in regard to these
helpless islanders.
N.S.W. Executive suffers from a unique
quandary at the present time. It finds its only
way to escape interminable trouble is to promptly
release prisoner Thomas Suffield, and release him
it would at once if only the prisoner would petition
for the Crown’s pardon or mercy. Suffield, how-
ever, declines pomt-blank to do any such thing,
but demands release on the ground of having been
wrongly convicted. The Executive is thus between
the devil and the deep sea.
Rev. Alex. Henderson, the gawky Scotch
Unitarian minister who has just gone ’Ome, never
got acclimatised in Melbourne. It is related in
Vic. medical circles that he recently called upon a
Collins-street doctor, who told him to strip.
Whereupon his reverence took off eight shirts and
a flannel binder, which binder he said was indis-
pensable as he had worn it ever since he was a
child. “ Eight shirts and only one God,” said the
doctor; “no wonder you feel sick.”
Louise Mack’s literary trifle, “ The World
is Round,” published by Fisher Unwin, got Eng-
lish notices which will encourage the young autho-
ress. The solemn, clerical Guardian describes it
as “ agreeably stimulating; ” the Literary World
said it was a “ very clever piece of writing ; ” and
London Daily Telegraph remarked that the story
was “ most cleverly written,” and augured well
for the success of the publisher’s new series. The
Times remarked : “It has the merit of being
cleverly written in the main. ”
W. H. Gray, the S.A. millionaire
miser, died the other day. He was a
big owner of Adelaide land-values, and
reputedly worth a million and a-half.
He carried his “ closeness ” so far that
he collected his own rents to save
agent’s commission, and walked to
Adelaide, five miles, to save tram-fares.
One of the sights of Adelaide was to
see Gray doing the block in a much-
patched suit, green with age.
The late N.S.W. Chief Justice
Martin was once invited out to dinner
in a Sydney suburb. His coachman —
now a Govt, messenger, who tells the
story himself —stabled his horses and re-
mained in the “servants’ hall” await-
ing his master. He imbibed —for the
first time, he says—a quantity of cham-
pagne. When it was time to return
home he was “gloriously incapable.”
The Chief, equal to the occasion, put
the coachman inside, mounted the
box, and drove to Potts Point himself.
Jehu expected the sack, but didn’t
get it.
The first Hebrew who occupied a
seat on the N.S.W. minor Bench was
the wealthy Joshua Frey Josephson,
about whose appointment there used
to be a queer story. He was Solicitor-
General in the Robertson Ministry
1868-9. The Govt, was very shaky;
so was a certain District Court Judge.
The Judge retired, and Josephson
took his place. The Govt, was recon-
structed three months afterwards.
There were then no retiring pensions
for D.C. Judges, but the man who
made way for Josephson spent the few
remaining months of his life in com-
fort.
Last week N.S.W. Premier Reid dignified
his office by appearing as counsel for the defence
in a neighbors’-backyard slangwhang. The trouble
was all about a tub. “You went into my yard
and stole my tub,” said one woman to the other
woman. Georgey-Porgey being a humorist, it is
hard to conceive why he should ever appear in a
tub case.
The Age publishes a list of successful
appeals against Supreme Court judgments during
the last three years, which must give pain to the
waxen Madden, Chief Justice, who tops the re-
cord, 18 of his judgments having been upset.
Williams comes a bad second with eight. Holroyd
is lowest on the list, only two of his judgments
breaking down on appeal.
M‘Lellan, “Dove of Ararat,” and Long-
more, member for Dandenong, are the two vener-
able enfants terribles of Vic. Assembly. The most
fluent and vehement of the younger generation of
politicians are mere mild tea-party orators com-
pared to these survivals of the Roaring Days.
Curiously enough, they never fall out with each
other. Which is just as well.

That is a tall story about Cecil Rhodes ar-
ranging to be shot by his companion sooner than
fall alive into the hands of the ferocious Matabele.
Nobody seems to know how his comrade was to be
shot in his turn. The yarn recalls the story of the
two girls who went out for a starlight ramble, and
made it up that if they met a rude man one was to
be insulted, and the other to scream for the police.
Murray Smith appeals to Vic. citizens for
the price of a decent tombstone to mark the grave
of James Harrison, one-time editor of Geelong
Advertiser, and a man of many worthy enter-
prises, who died in 1893. James Harrison was
“the first man in the world to make artificial ice
on a commercial scale for commercial purposes.”
At the time of his death he was engaged in the
apparently profitless business (in Vic.) of solar
salt making.

Longford, Ireland, and his refusal of the profferec
P.C.-ship was no doubt based on the faet the.',

as a prima-facie abandonment of his allegiance t-

Sam. Crisp, of the well-known legal firm o'
Crisp and Cameron, has just died. One of th
last lawsuits he had arose out of one of his clerk
trying to serve a writ or something on someor;
upon Jos. Symes’ premises. He had formerly
been Jos’, solicitor, but Jos. and his solicitor never
managed to agree long. Despite his alleged an
tipathy to anarchists, Jos. and constituted author 1
ties of every sort appear to be sworn enemies.
Evangelist M‘Neil, the just-dead, had a
his sermons stolen at Spencer-street railway
station, Melb., and therefrom dated all his infib
ence and notoriety. It is told of him that a fev-
days before his sudden death at Brisbane he kneb
down and kissed the rail of the railroad because n
would so soon take him home to his wife in Mein
The deceased evangelist owed £BOO on his hous

The eccentric Rev. James Clarke showeo

when personally conducting his case against tfc-
Sheriff and police, for assault and wrongful detec-
tion. The rev. litigant was Suspected of having «
pistol in a handbag, which he took into court dic-
ing the hearing of the case in which he was ooi
cerned, and the Chief Justice ordered him to t-
removed and searched. No weapon was fount
and for undue violence and undue detention te
which plaintiff was subjected the jury award*'
him ,£lOO damages. Case was heard before Mi
Justice Simpson, who, placed in a delicate poi -
tion, held the scales of justice with admiral
impartiality.
Australian Supreme Court Judges rarer-
appear in the witness-box. The elder Molesworfc
did, in his divorce-suit; M. H. Stephen was
witness against the prisoners acquitted of shootir,.
Constable Slater ; Fellowes appeared once in
civil suit, and was invited to give his evidence free
the bench. But he declined ; putting his red b&:
dana into the old white hat, he placed the latt
on the floor and stepped into the box. Last wee ;
Chief Justice Darley appeared before Justice
Simpson as a witness in Clarke v.
and was rebuked by his presiding Honor for ‘ as-
suming ” something. “ Assumptions,” sente*
tiously remarked Judge Simpson to the Chiei.
“aren’t evidence.” _


A MINISTER’S SMOKE NIGHT.
The fourth social smoke evening in connection
with St. James’ Church was held in St. James’
Parish-hall, Phillip-sltreet, last night, and proved
quite as successful amf enjoyable as its predeces-
sors. There were about 100 parishioners present.
The Rev. Carr-Smith, vicar of St. James’, is
satisfied that much good is being wrought by
these gatherings.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A prominent Maoriland prohibitionist —
formerly an anti-compensation man—says that he
now believes in compensation, because “it is not
fair for the publican to stand all the loss.” All
the loss. If Maoriland goes in for Prohibition,
the revenue will lose <£59,000 a year beer excise
a eu- £400,000 in Customs duties, to say
nothing of the revenue from licenses. There are
q-te a lot of losses in the business which the
prohibition-party seemingly hasn’t begun to think
about yet.
JOHN’S LATEST.
“ A Chinese explained a stone tied
co his scales by saying that the scales
had only been put on the counter
while the floor was being scrubbed.
Discharged.”— NEWS ITEM.
LOO SHANG : “ All li, boss! Me tie stone to scales ’cos wind come
blow ’em away, that’s all li! You savee?"
So far as they have gone, the N.S.W.
Public Service Commissioners have recommended
the granting of pensions amounting to £6657 a
year to retrenched civil servants ; also gratuities
amounting to <£19,652, and refunds out of the
Superannuation Fund amounting to £1353. And
this is only the beginning.
The next Vic. Agent-General, to succeed
the somnolent and indolent Gillies, is to be a prac-
tical man who will care less for the showy part of
the business than for looking after the “ producing
interests.” The chances of Minister Taverner are
talked about, as he has been a busy, smart man at
the head of the Department of Agriculture.
The retired State - school teacher who
claimed £20,000 damages from the Vic. Education
Dept, for breach of contract, &c., is admitted to
have taken £l4O lump sum as a retiring allowance,
in lieu of a yearly pension of £43 7s. sd. Is the
Vic. Government an Ikey money-dealer, that it
makes such terms with impecunious clients ?
S.A. Oppositionists, with the help of the
Register, are anxious to depose Copley from the
leadership, as they do not think him aggressive
enough. They want to induce Solomon to take
the position, but he is too rich and too newly-
married and lias not enough time to spare. Besides,
he is too friendly with Kingston, who took the
trouble to go to Melbourne to attend his wedding.
Ex-Treasurer See (N.S.W.) is understood
to have publicly announced that when he and his
party come back to power the land-tax will be
repealed. The Dibbs-Lyne-See party, when it was
in power, tried to pass a much more drastic land-
tax than the present one, and the Reid party
opposed it. Then when the Reid party stole its
idea the Lyne-See party allowed itself to drift
over or be elbowed over to the other side from the
mere habit of being ‘ * agin ” the Reid party, and
the two parties silently swapped ideas, and thus it
comes about that John See is out loose upon the
face of the earth committing his supporters to
views which they mostly repudiate, and misrepre-
senting his own cause generally.
Melb. Herald has been interviewing
portly parsons and Fat Men generally on the
burning question—“ The Turk, shall we endure
him ? ” The parsons and other persons are unani-
mously of opinion that we should not bear with
the Turk, but should hotly protest at once, and
thereby “ strengthen England’s hand.” The ad-
visability “ of our minding our own blanky busi-
ness ”is not even hinted at. Some people are so
curiously constructed that they cannot hear of an
alligator without wanting to go far out of their
way to examine his tonsils.
Australia is thinking of federating, and the
N.S.W. Government is thinking of combining the
two Savings Banks into a State Bank of issue.
On the strength of these two possibilities there is
already talk of building a new Parliament House,
which can serve later on for the Federal Legisla-
ture, and reserving the best site in Sydney, at the
corner of Martin Place and George-street, for a
palatial bank structure, so that the new institution,
when it comes along, may be the National Bank
of Federated Australia. This off-hand way of
assuming that Sydney must be the Federal capital,
and that no other place is even in the running,
isn’t likely to help along Federation to any extent
worth weeping over.
The universal Saturday
half-holiday in Victoria is ex-
pected by Govt, to work a
considerable increase in the
railway returns. Peacock’s
Shops and Factories Act has
an eye to next year’s Bud-
get.
Carroll, who resigned
his N.S.W. Assembly seat
the other nightthrough bank-
ruptcy, and went back to his
constituents for political re-
habilitation, audaciously
“ cheeked ” Speaker Abbott
in his official home a short
while back. “ Better and
abler men than you,” re-
marked Carroll, “ have oc-
cupied the Speaker’s chair,
and were content with half
the rooms you own and half
the servants you require to
wait on you.” Mr. Speaker
stared. “ £l2OO a year and
perks, and seven rooms and
attendance isn’t bad,” rubbed
in Carroll.
It cannot be consoling
to Premier Reid when he con-
templates the gradual growth
of the unpopularity which
at last comes permanently or
temporarily to every politi-
cian, to remember that at
least four of his present col-
leagues rounded on their pre-
vious chief, Parkes, and
treated him to what he al-
ways considered a base be-
trayal. “My dear sir,” he
said one day to a friend, on
the names of some of his for-
mer colleagues being men-
tioned, “ I can’t trust myself
to speak of them.” Yet they
once were far more subser-
vient to Parkes than they
are to Reid. The latter
must feel like a man who has
become possessed of a dog
that bit its last owner.
The disorganisation of the Freetrade party
i”-N.S.W. Parliament is evidenced by the fact
that, at five out of six consecutive sittings, busi-
ness was blocked by a motion of adjournment
moved by a Government supporter. The party
grew so accustomed to obstruction in the days of
A REAL BLIND MAN.
the Dibbs Ministry, when it moved 13 votes of
censure in two years, that it now obstructs itself
from sheer force of habit.
Maoriland Public Health Amendment Bill
provides for shutting out foreign consumptives
unless they belong to the British military or naval
forces, or are agents sent by foreign Governments,
or “persons who are from time to time excepted
by the Governor-in-Council.” Query : Why
should the Governor-in-Council or the Governor
in anything else be allowed to make exceptions.
If a tuberculosed person has influence enough to
move the Governor-in-Council he is still just as
much tuberculosed as if he hadn’t, and it is just as
dangerous for him to come and expectorate the
debris of his lungs on the land as if he was any
other consumptive.
The case of Carroll, ex-M.P. (N.S.W.),
again illustrates the mockery of the Parliamentary
law which obliges a bankrupt member to resign
and yet permits him to be re-elected and resume
his seat before the court has made any investiga-
tion into his affairs. A bankrupt peer cannot sit
in the House of Lords until he receives his certifi-
cate of discharge.
Melbourne’s “Northern
suburban railway ” is up for
discussion for the fortieth
time. There are two rival
routes for this railway—one
through Collingwood, and the
other through Fitzroy—but
nobody knows what fabulous
sum each would cost for land
alone. If lands were assessed
by the owners for tax with
State right of resumption at
the assessment plus a percent-
age for disturbance, the Go-
vernment would know defi-
nitely in advance how much
any particular line would cost.
Under the present system
it goes into the business
blindly.
Barrister Fisher’s tilts
against the Vic. criminal pro-
cedure continue, and, it is to
be hoped, with some effect.
He points uut the unfairness
of the method of the pre-
sentment ; demands the ap-
pointment of a director-
general of prosecutions on the
English model ; alludes to the
unfortunate fact that judges,
who had never held one
criminal brief while at the
Bar, are called on to decide
in questions involving liberty
or life ; queries the justice
of the practice by which,
while records of previous
convictions are withheld from
the jury, they are supplied
to the judge on the back of
the presentment; and strenu-
ously maintains the right of
the accused to be supplied
with some means of com-
bating the often malig-
nant zeal and technical train-
ing of the Crown Prosecu-
tors.
In Dec., 1894, N.S.W. Leg. Council, by
23 to 9 votes, carried that boys shall be allowed to
work 10 hours a day in coal-mines. By “ boy ”is
meant a youth between 14 and 18. The Assembly
stood out for eight hours, but compromised the
other day and accepted nine. There is no doubt
the Upper House would have rejected eight hours
had the Assembly insisted on the clause. In an
Eight Hours country like Australia the authorisa-
tion by legal enactment of a nine hours stretch
for boys calls for early reconsideration.
“ The Federal capital,” says Chief Justice
Sam Griffith, “ should be central, easy of access,
not unduly exposed to the risks of invasion, and
its climate should not be such as to render it an
undesirable place of residence.” That knocks out,
m one act, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney,
Brisbane, Hobart, Launceston, Townsville, Cook-
town, and various others. They are all con-
venient for invasion at the shortest notice, and
every one of them is as far from being central as
any place can be, seeing that they are all on the
outermost rim of a circumference. Griffith de-
scribes accurately what the Federal city should
be, and as no Australian city fills the bill it is
necessary to build one for the purpose.
Sydney Telegraph proposes that the
relative advantages of Foreign-trade and Pro-
tection, as between N.S.W. and Vic., should
be settled once for all by “a comparison of
the market quotations of well-known brands
of imports . . An inquiry of this kind,” it
says “ covering the whole field of imports,
would do more to set at rest any doubt which
may exist as to what Protection costs the Vic-
torian consumer than any presentation of
Government figures.” This guileless way of
settling the difficulty, it will be seen, is to
deal with imports only. It isn’t to be a
question of retail prices all round, but simply
retail prices of imported goods. All the long
list of articles which N.S.W. imports and Vic-
toria manufactures for herself is to be left
out of the question altogether ! As a way of
settling any doubt which may exist,” this
proposition is unique.
Premier Seddon (M.L.) : “ Posterity
cannot do us any good, but on the other hand
we may do and are doing great and good
v/ork for posterity.” (Applause.) Base in-
gratitude ! Posterity cannot do us any good !
\V by, within the memory of people yet living
1 osterity has lent us some two-hundred million
pounds, or has backed our bill for thatamount •
therefore, Posterity has built all our railways
and telegraphs and most of our roads, bridges
breakwaters, lighthouses, fortifications, public
buildings, telephones, and irrigation works
and has dredged our rivers, and thinned
our forests, and done the sand-shifting job
at Sydney Centennial Park and the Shea’s
Creek reclamation, and paid for the ammuni-
tion fired off in the Maori war, and supplied
the money to fill revenue deficiencies, and con-
structed rabbit-proof fencing, and—well what
is there m all this great country that Posterity
hasn t done for us ?
Longmore asks Yic. Assembly to compel
owners of large estates adjacent to railways to sell
a portion of the land each year, with the object of
encouraging settlement and thereby reducing the
railway deficit. The Argus must be more than
ever convinced that Longmore is a “ firebrand.”
Melb. Age on Duncan Gillies :
For twenty years to come it will be impossible for Vic-
toria to entirely recover the awful blows which his finan-
cial saturnalia inflicted upon her. He stood revealed to
the whole world as a political weakling, the, sport of every
breath of party influence, purchasing the continuance of
a debased Ministerial life by wholesale political briberv of
the constituencies. "
Gillies returns to Melbourne presently, and David
byme is preparing a suitable welcome for him A
huge brick of contumely will be hurled straight at
little Duncan s weskit the day he lands.
Premier Kingston’s reply to the successful
efforts of the S. A. Ass party to block his Leg.
fi-ouncil Iranchise Bill is characteristic. “Next
year, says Kingston, “we will introduce a
measure to enfranchise everyone who oocupies a
dwelling, irrespective of the amount of rent ”

The Boodlewraith is again busily bestirring
itself in the interests of Assisted Immigration to
Queensland, Dickson actually advocating free im-
migration for domestic servants. For the benefit
of intending immigrants it may be mentioned that,
according to the report of the Govt. Labor Bureau,
the rate of wages offered to farm-laborers in
Queensland in 1895 ranged from Bs. to 15s. a week,
and the supply was five to one on the demand !!!
Champion says truly that Alfred Deakin’s
political future is daily damaged by his profes-
sional duties. Deakin, the democrat, seems to be
specially unfortunate in those duties. He is
always on the side of Fat Man—defending the
unjustly accused shipowners before a Sangster
Board, or proclaiming the honesty and virtue of
boom-time bank balance-sheets. It is hard for a
Melb. barrister to act like a desirable kind of
politician. Look at Purves, Q.C. The large,
outspoken speeches he made of yore to the A.N. A.
were inconsistent with bis recent defence of the
City of Melbourne bankers.
The Sydney D.T. : “The taxpayer green
enough to accept an Act that allows workmen to
fix their own wages badly needs a kindergarten
lesson.” Yet the same D.T., when striving to
pose as the friend of Labor, can quote glibly
enough the economical scripture that a workman
has as much right to fix the price at which he will
sell his labor as a shopkeeper has to fix the price
at which he will sell his commodities. Only more
so, since labor is a commodity plus flesh-and-blood.
Also, don’t a lawyer, a doctor, a dentist, an archi-
tect, and others, fix the price at which they will
sell their labor? Doesn’t the D.T. fix the price
at which it will sell itself? (The last is meant
both ways—this way and the other way.)
The “Idler” Says,
“ When a thing that is advertised greatly is good,
it goes and goes permanently, when it is bad it
only goes for awhile. The public finds it out.”
The verdict of the public, stamping its approval
or disapproval upon the merit of things, is
generally reliable. Is it not easy to see that the
enormous popularity of that greatest of all
remedies —Warner’s Safe Cure —which has been
so prominently before the public for so many
years, is based upon invaluable merit ? Thousands
of men and women in all parts of the world are
kept alive by its use, and the millions who 'find it
a means of preserving their health and prolonging
their lives will answer unhesitatingly, “ Yes.”
Mr. J. S. Storey, Erskine St., Sydney, N.S.W.,
writes : “ I have much pleasure in testifying to
the efficiency of Warner’s ‘Safe’ Cure. I have
used it for the past three or four years for both
fevers and severe colds, and have found it an
excellent remedy if used in time. lam now en-
joying splendid health, which I attribute solely to
the free use of this medicine, and can most cer-
tainly recommend it to any person suffering from
similar complaints. The universal curative proper-
ties should make it invaluable in the bush. ”


In the Yic. railway service they have got
the system of appeals down so fine, in the anxiety
to do strict justice to everybody, that the other
day it cost the court half-a-day and over £4 of
salaries to decide that a very subordinate official
hadn’t been improperly fined 2s. 6d. for inefficient
cleaning of a carriage.

Eno’s “Fruit Salt” (one of Nature’s own

preserving and restoring health it is unequalled ;
and it is, moreover, a pleasant, refreshing and in-
vigorating beverage. After a patient and careful
observation of its effects when used, I have no

A Riot of LoVdioe&S-
Ode on the Opening of the Kalgoorlie
Railway, September 8, 1896.
No blast had shaken the reefs that lay,
■Blowing and dipping, like whales at play,
In the ocean of stratified rock :
Kalgoorlie, as yet, was a name unheard,
Except by the blacks, who had coined the word
From their tautologic stock.
The hard, earth crust had a garb of green,
Of salt-bush puny and dwarf-gum lean
And mulga with stunted stems,
Which, as the sun the landscape crowned,
All spread their weftage on the ground
With glittering quartz for gems.
No trail was famous, no wheelwrights’ fires
Had ever been cheated of waggon tyres
By the tug of the Devil’s Pinch :
The latticed wastes had not yet wrung
The creak from the passing load that swung
Sideways many an inch.
And still, in vain, for evermore
Would you have called, as the wind swept o er,
Like the ripply romp of a shelly shore,
O gold-bespattered West:
Had not your depths been honeycombed
By miners who burrowed in drives reef-domed —
The batteries tell the rest.
And you, Kalgoorlie, Hannan’s “ Show,”
With kings of mines, where, three years ago,
None wot of the Boulder lode,
Surprise with each new battery fed ;
Your dumps, like beads upon a thread,
Lie along every road.
But grieve for the stricken of your van-guard
When your cams are giving the accolade,
While fortunes leave the mill !
Baffled, uncoffined, their shrouds were spun
By the mists that rose to meet the sun
Round Maritana Hill.
Now, for this jovial week, proclaim
Welcome, in welcome’s friendliest name,
With banners gay unfurled !
At last, for you, has been grafted on
A rib to the iron skeleton
That carries the flesh of the world!
SPOUTING NOTIONS.
The last day’s play in the Australians final
match was not satisfactorily accounted for by the strictly-
partial cablegrammer. Bare particulars to hand state
that the two last men of the English team resumed opera-
tions on a heavy, “ but easy,” wicket and added 38 runs
by “ hitting out merrily ” before Richardson was caught.
Donnan and Iredale then led off the Australians’ second
innings, and made 22 runs for no wickets before lunch-
time. After lunch, J. T. Hearne went on to bowl and
either he or the wicket became so “treacherous and
difficult ” that the ten men were downed for an additional
41 runs, making a total of 63. The South of England men
followed with 45 for two wickets (presumably the ground
had ceased to be treacherous), and then the match ended
in a draw. Only 146 runs were made during the day.
There is no mention of rain having interrupted play, or of
stumps being drawn earlier than usual. How long were
the Australians batting for their 41 runs after luncheon ?
Also, how would the cable reports have been worded in the
event of the Englishmen escaping a defeat as the visitors
seem to have escaped it ?
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —The Australians’ record for
their matches with the nine strongest teams they met
during the tour is practically eight defeats and one vic-
tory. Three of the practical defeats were drawn games,
in each of which Trott won the toss. Again, I will say
that the last Eleven was the luckiest, as well as the
steadiest, that has gone ’Ome. Throughout the dry
season, when the winning of the toss was a considerable
advantage, Trott won it nearly every time. And when
the weather happened to change during a game, the
change favored the Australians. Furthermore, not one of
the nine best English teams aforesaid had first innings on
a real “batsman’s wicket,” and in only three cases did
they bat first, anyway. —T.C.S.
* * * *
J. T. Hearne, more or less (generally more), was
concerned in three out of six English victories against
Australia, including the “off” match at Leyton. Two of
the other three were due to Bobby Peel. It. has not yet
been remarked that Trott’s Eleven departed from all
traditions of Australian cricket in England by getting
beaten on sticky pitches, not because they were deficient
in cunning bowling talent, but because they had no dash-
ing sloggers among them. They are a patient fine-weather
team, and, if they progress all right in the meantime,
Australia should win a majority of the test-matches
against Stoddart’s next invaders.
* * * *
Nearly all the Australians suffered from the
trying June weather in England, Giffen and Darling
particularly. By the way, the English seemed to
think the team was quite happy when the sun blazed ;
in some cases the intense heat was made an excuse for
English defeats. One paper, just after the test-match,
alleged that the visitors thought nothing of batting and
fielding in Australia with the thermometer at 120 deg. in
the shade! Why don’t the Pirate Bits papers say
straight out that Australians shed their skins in summer?
* * * *
Some of the English papers have promoted one
or two of the Australians. Jones, the Adelaide Exhibi-
tion ground-hand, is described as a lawyer, and Johns is
credited with having a large Melb. legal practice.
* * » *
Dear Bulletin, —The Times didn’t assert, sug-
gest, or insinuate that an English University eleven was
equal to the Australian team at all points. It said, by
way of testifying to the activity and alertness of “ our
boys,” that they fielded quite as well as the University
young men — i.e,, equal to the smartest fielding-teams
procurable in Hingland. There is really no occasion for
your ultra-patriotic paragraphists to howl about Hinglish
press-criticism of Australian cricket, which is much more
fair and generous than Australian reports of international
contests. There now ! —Bothsydes.
* * * *
Against the theory that Murdoch’s first, or
second, eleven was equal to Trott's crowd, old stagers will
always advance the fact that English cricket was half-
asleep fifteen years ago. The Australian visits woke it up.
The pro’s were lazy, slovenly fieldsmen in those times,
whereas their work nowadays is neat and clever, although
not quite as hearty as the best amateur “ scouting.”

The Australian Eleven, being top dog, can
afford to ignore the Australian Cricket Council. That
clutch of antiquated nobodies is fighting the public as
well as the Eleven, for the public will roll up to see its
gods no matter what a hopelessly ineffectual body like
the Cricket Council may protest. Herein is shown
manager Musgrove’s capacity. Having run leg-shows and
other attractions, he gauges the public temperament to a
nicety. The only regret is that the Eleven, after having
a real fat time, should open itself to the charge that it is
still ravenous for “ gate.”

That 31 ’B2 of Syd. Gregory’s for 49 innings tops
Murdoch’s best of '30’62 per innings. N.S.W. won each
time. N.S.W. takes the palm in batting, bowling, and
wicket-keeping this trip. Perhaps Syd. Gregory might
take it for fielding too, though Trumble is understood to
have been sensational in the slips.

“ Clem. Hill’s 118 against Surrey and 74 against
Kent,” writes “ An Australian Abroad ” to The Bulletin,
“ were most valuable innings, and when he becomes a
little stronger on the off-side, where he has some danger-
ous uppish strokes, he should be one of the best batsmen
Australia has ever produced.
“The match at Bexhill against Earl De La
Warr’s Eleven was a delightful picnic, but if the cricketers
intend to enjoy such outings as these, they should, cer-
tainly make sure of winning, or people are certain to
think thej r have been subordinating cricket to stomach.
“Jones sent down the wickets like nine-pins at
Birmingham in the match against Warwickshire, clean
bowling five, and getting six wickets for 33 runs. The
Broken Hill man is a very fine successful bowler, but if he
is hit at all I don’t believe he has too much heart; he
certainly feels punishment severely.
“ Now that this Eleven have established them-
selves as a successful combination, they want to keep
things going as long as it is possible to make money. A
Maoriland tour is already fixed without anyone being
consulted, and they talk of playing a match in Brisbane,
and probably also Melbourne and Adelaide before they
give up. ‘ Why shouldn’t we make some money while we
can’’they ask, and apparently as far as they are con-
cerned Interprovincial cricket can go to the devil.
“ The match the team propose to play in Paris
will be got up purely to encourage foreigners to take up
the noble game with more enthusiasm. (Apart, of course,
from the political view of the question, for it is sure to
strengthen those cordial relations, &c., &c.). That it is
not likely to come off at all unless the financial prospects
are good is mere rumor. Besides the boys want to see
Paris before they return.

The Australians’ batting pans out well against
the Britishers. Australians, 12,246 runs for 511 wickets;
average, 24 per wicket; Britishers, 10,058 for 581 wickets;
average, 17.3 per wicket. The Australians scored 18 cen-
turies against the opposing bowling, while only three cen-
turies were made against them. The Australians scored
300 or over 15 times, while the Britishers made 300 or
over twice. The biggest score of the Australians was
625 against Derbyshire, while the Britishers’ top is the
M.C.O. innings (second match) of 367. The lowest Aus.
score was 18 against Marylebone, while the lowest British
score was"Gloucestershire's 17.
* * * *
Pougher’s 5 wickets for 0 against Australia in
the first M.C.O. match stands easily first as a bowling
feat. Trumble bagged 6 for 8 against Gloucestershire,
and M'Kibbin 4 for 7 ; and M'Kibbin took 7 for 11 against
Lancashire. Hearne took 6 for Bin the last match.

Dear Bulletin, — Re the time-test as applied to
Hinglish and “colonial” batting, I would like to add a
postcript to my previous letter in reply to “ Australia.”
He instanced the slow scoring of the Surrey team in dis-
proof of my statements, and I suggested that we should
wait for full particulars. Herewith I quote two fragments
of full particulars from Melbourne, not London, papers.
The first relates to the drawn game with M.C.O. : —“ On
afternoon of the second day, about 5 o’clock, the Austra-
lians went in 165 to the bad to fight against time, and by
securing a draw avert defeat. By very slow, very careful
and very determined play this was managed, but it
raised the antipathies of the crowd, who howled with
derision as ball after ball was carefully played and runs
came at the rate of about 40 an hour, and even these
made by sudden brilliant dashes in the midst of long and
dreary intervals of stonew.alling.” And now, touching
that slow Surrey innings, which, by the way, didn’t last
all day, as “ Australian ” asserted: —“When Surrey won
the toss there was just a question as to whether they
would bat first or put their opponents in, but Read would
not run the latter risk, and sent in Abel and Brockwell,
who made a fine start. . . . The. pitch was playing
none too well, and it could not be said that the cricket
was very interesting. . . . The innings lasted five
hours for 283, an excellent achievement, under the cir-
cumstances.” —The Culprit Scribe.
* * * *
Some of the best scores made by the Australian
Eleven were against the English reporters. “We never
play in Adelaide when it is more than 125 deg. in the
shade.”
“ ‘ Who won the boatrace ? ’ said a tram-guard
who came on to relieve a morning shift man at noon
yesterday. ‘Gaudaur.’ ‘ Was it a close race ? Gon
know; haven’t seen or heard a word about it. lnen
how do you know Gaudaur won?’ Because Id ha e
heard plenty if it had been the other fellow." Sydney E.
Nbws - „
Melbourne papers that gave two-thirds of a
column to Stanbury’s victory over Harding, gave two
inches to Gaudaur’s victory over Stanbury. At least the
noble press does not encourage the people to magnify
their sorrows.

London Referee, commenting on the Stanbury-
Hardmg match, makes the subsequent downing of Stan-
bury by veteran Gaudaur appear quite natural. “Last
Monday afternoon,” says the Ref. oracle, “I found myself
ln ” e^ween Thames’ banks, wondering- what
earthly good I was as an old sport if I couldn’t under-
stand so simple a thing as a professional sculler’s race.
James htanbury, the New South Welshman, I saw smother
Richard Harding, the English boat-puller. That the said
James did worry his boat along at a great rate, and quite
outpace the little fellow from Chelsea, I quite recognised.
No one who reads my ‘ Notions ’ can find cause for accusing
•” e of having a down on Australia or Australians—rather
the other way about is my habitual tendency, is it not?
L i lu^ en^on because I am about to record
that the contest filled me with surprise and dissatisfac-
tion. ... We all know that Stanbury must be a right
good man, or he could not get such way on his boat and
keep the pace up over the Thames championship-
course, and, as his method results so profitably in
this way, I suppose _we must accept it as right for
him. But that he is what I always was taught
was a good sculler I will not have at any
price whatever. ... With all his power and length,
he carefully avoids approaching the conventional stan-
dard of good form. Not an inch does he swing, only sits
straight up in his boat, and, with a mighty shove of the
legs ana tug of the anus, drags his sculls through the
water to finish bolt-upright. Harding stuck to his bad
bargain gamely enough, but never, to my thinking,
showed any dash or life. He was, I believe, kale. lam
aware that it is not easy to dash much in sculling a stern
wager after a man who cuts you down in a single stroke,
as the big Antipodean did the little Cockney. Still one
waited and waited, expecting the Thames man to do
something more than plod along Probably Stan-
bury could have shown us much better form I
would have given something to see him hardly pressed, so
as to understand what his form is when reallv extended.”
Gaudaur really extended Stanbury, and the Waler’s form
was proved bad, seemingly.
* * » *
Stanbury coining straight back to Australia
after being’ defeated by Gaudaur! The strongest evidence

The Yankee boys from Yale University came to
Henley Regatta in a very modest, spirit, saying “ We came
here to row, but more to learn to row than anything
else.” A fine-looking crew, pulling a short, scrappy
stroke when collared, the Yales were put out of it in their
first heat.
* * » *
Now that the Harding race is over,” writes an
Australian abroad to The Bulletin-, “ one hears a little
news. Very little money could be got on by Stanbury
and co., in spite of the fact that he was drowned, broke
his oars, and did all that was possible to give the other
side a chance. Then he began to vomit blood after every
short spurt, and did several other extraordinary things—
so report had it. Now it leaks out that Stanbury did all
his work under the watchful eye of Tom Sullivan at
Sa.m., while the spurts and daylight trials were ordinary
bluffs.

Cyclist Elliott is a nerveful personage. The
last time he was in a big race he had to start in a final at
i; he lay down at 2, and slept till 3.30. Were Clinton
and Matthews, of Vic., able to do this, what races
those fine sprinters could show the public ! Parsons, too,
was a nervous subject; the night before his first Austral
he did not sleep a wink.
* * * *
It is alleged that the secret of a great cyclist’s
misogyny is a love affair which occurred some years ago.
He was not jilted, however ; indeed, what woman, seeing
his iovely legs plugging into his 96 gear, would dream of
jilting him !
* * * *
The valorous Bilmartin did mighty deeds at
Brisbane. While training one evening he came a fearful
slump, covering the asphalt for yards with blood and
meat scraps. Then he arose with a red, raw leg 1 and an
undaunted eye, and rested till next day. When the
truthful reporters arrived, the ’Murkan showed them his
ankle-bone, which was bare, because its hair and skin had
been left upon the track the night previous. Nathless
Bill trained next day. At the end of a week he placed
his bare ankle-bone and red, raw leg upon the pedal of
cycling history and romped in with new records from 2 to
25 miles. He did all this because he got a fee of £l2O
from the Beckman gear people.
* * * *
The Beckman gear increased the weight of
Martin’s cycle from 22J to 361 b. This gear clainis to get
power i.e., speed—out of the cyclist’s arms as well as
hands.

Bilmartin, it is said, was struck so hard up in
Brisbane by Cupid’s dart that it raised a blister on his
chest. The blister vanished in a day, however and
Bilmartin smiled again.

Cycling is beginning to smell. Clothes, boots,
&c., are frequently being stolen f jm training-quarters :
bookmaking on cycle-tracks in N.S. W. country districts is
rampant; nearly everybody is riding more or less “ stiff ”
in order to scoop a big pot. Ex-peds. and fly-boys are
either a-wheel or training equally immoral associates
a-wheel. Stables are growing in size and number, and
the strongest smell comes from Smellbourne
* * * *
Eor mediaeval caddishness, the cake has been
taken by certain Vic. civil servants—lordly youths who
101 l over the chairs talking horse while the public pounds
its knuckles on the counter—who have—haw !—formed a
Cm] Service Cycling Club, among the rules of which is
this gem Subject to the approval of the committee
the club shall be open to all past and present members of
the public service, other than messengers, house-keepers
court-keepers, criers, warders, guards, porters, police
below the rank of sub-inspector, non-commissioned
officers and privates of permanent naval and military
forces, or persons whose duties are of a mechanical or
unskilled character, or who are in the non-clerical divi-
sion of the public service. For the purpose of this rule
the Mint, Metropolitan Board of Works, Victorian Rail-
ways, and the Melbourne Harbour Trust shall be deemed
to be part of the public service.” The club is understood
to have emanated from the Custom House, where Com-
missioner Best’s father is still employed in a non-clerical
capacity, and is consequently debarred from membership
Well might Francis Adams have said “ I hate fashionable
Victorians. They’re such snobs. They are worse than
English people.” And the most sickening part of the
whole show is the fact that the aristocrat who runs the
cycling column of a professedly socialistic and democratic
Melb. journal is allowed to defend this rule on the ground
of its “ keeping out larrikinism ” !

W. S. Wedd, the good all-round athlete who
won last Saturday’s Bendigo-to-Melb. road-race, was
literally unknown to the general body of cyclists prior to
that date. He received 30min. start of Middleton on
scratch (the latter retired ill) ; yet he pedalled home in
shrs. 28min. 40secs.—faster time than anyone else in the
race.
* * * *
E- A. Pearson’s 50-miles road win at Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) in 2hrs. was a good performance
over such rough and hilly country. He secured first
prize, and fastest time-prize. Pearson began cycling in
’B4, started racing two years later ; did so moderately that
he dropped it in ’BB, and went in for rowing. The last
three years he has been an interprovincial eight-oar man.
He says his recent win is greatly due to the excellent
pacing he had.
* * * *
Megson, Payne, and Lewis have, so far, shown
themselves no match for the English cracks. Apart from
the fact that they are all more or less ignorant of the
essentials of training, it is well to remember how the
sick Zimmerman left their class “■standing” in a sprint.
And Zim. found our tracks just as big a handicap as
Megson and co. would find Catford,
Pearson, who rode a “Red Bird,” won the Im-
perial Rover bicycle presented by Messrs. Bennett and
Wood in the N.S.W. 50-mile road race last Saturday.

M'Donell, thanks to Kahlo, his trainer, will
come to the post in splendid form for his 25-roile match
with Martin. These American cyclists and trainers have
twice the brain of the local talent. Lewis, Megson, and
Payne in globo haven’t the amount of intelligence that
M'Donell possesses. The Australian, careless and con-
ceited, allows any trifling allurement to divert him from
his work. Yankee Martin is all method, and has more
force of character than any other cyclist in Australia.
The moment he is due on the track he is there—everyday.
Nothing can divert him from his fell purpose. “ I must
go right ahead,” he says, “and do what I ought and win
all I can.”

A week or two ago a wave of perfervid loyalty
landed heavily on the rorty South Melb. football-club,
and it forwarded a delicately-tinted note to Govmentouse,
craving the presence of “Uncle Tom” at its match with
the Oollingwood. lI.E. accepted, and the South pro-
ceeded to bill Melb. with posters headed with the phiz, of
viceroyalty to boom the match. But when the South
came to reckon up accounts with Oollingwood it carefully
docked half the expense of entertaining the Governor and
printing his portrait from the latter’s div. But the
Collingwoods “ weren’t having any,” and wrote in
strong terms to the Tie. Football Association complaining
of the South’s action, more especially as the aristocratic
Southerners, though they assisted the vice-regal party to
“ scoff ” the victuals provided, did not deem the Woodsies’
committee.“ class enough ”to partake of the feed. Like-
wise there is one item of £2 2s. for a band, which played
Himperial ditties under Uncle Tom’s nose, which is dis-,
puted by the Northern suburb. Altogether, there is
every element for an amusing squabble ahead. The Go-
vernor might obviate this by magnanimously offering to
pay the disputed amount out of his own pocket. He
might !
* * • *
After three months “consideration ” that hypo-
critical body, the Vic. Football Association, has decided to
disqualify footballer Webb for life. Webb originally played
for the Essendon, and after peregrinating three' or
four other clubs, was refused a permit for another
change. Shortly after this the Essendon delegate made
a stirring speech about the purity of the sport and
the nobility- of amateurism, which impelled Webb
to write to the Association stating that during
the time he played for Essendon he was paid as a profes-
sional. Then a committee of inquiry was appointed with
the result above stated. Extraordinary to relate, the
Essendon Club and the Essendon delegate are left severely
alone, though if Webb’s letter be true, as the committee
has unquestionably decided, they are equally culpable and
answerable.
* * * *
Oollingwood, which beat Carlton 9g. 15b. to
lg. 3b., now leads for the Vic. football premiership, but
has to meet the powerful Fitzroy team (victor over
S. Melb. last Saturday), to-day, 19th. Whichever way
the game goes, Oollingwood seem likely 1896 premiers, as
P. Melb. has a very good chance of defeating S. Melb.
Should that happen, Essendon should get second place.
* * :fc *
With the defeat of S. Melb. by Eitzroy, what
would have been a unique finale to the Yic. football
season—a tie for the premiership—is averted, unless
Collingw-ood as well should happen to go down before
Fitzroy. For the sake of the sport it is to be hoped the
“Woodsies” will be beaten : a big play-off at the end of
the season would do a lot to revive interest.

Early next month there will be an election for
five seats on the V.A.T.C. committee. Only two new can-
didates are likely to come forward, and as one of the
retiring members is not seeking re-election one of the
strangers is certain of a seat. Interest in the contest is
confined to the question whether the other outsider will
be chosen instead of Mr. “ Dowry ” O’ Halloran.
* * * *
The V.R.C. government has given way on one
point of its old conservative policy, by agreeing to leave
bye-elections of committeemen in the hands of club-mem-
bers. Hitherto, the club has been restricted to the right
of filling up the periodical vacancies on the committee.
When a death or retirement happened between general
elections the survivors put on their own man with a
private ballot, and to this absurd privilege the holders
clung tenaciously. At last annual meeting, Mr. R. A.
Molesworth made a vigorous attack on the system, and
last week the gallant defenders decided to capitulate
without parley.

Callanan, the jockey who steered Merman so
cleverly the other Saturday at Caulfield, was mentioned
in The Bulletin as the coming boy when he rode Cydnus
and Homespun on the last day of the V.R.C. autumn
meeting. A more promising boy than Stevenson, or any
other of them since Gorry used to show the veterans how
to finish a race. Backing Callanan’s mounts would have
been a successful business up to date.
* * * *
The A.J.C. in determining to seek legislative
sanction for the introduction of the totalisator into
N.S.W. makes a praiseworthy effort to lessen the evils of
horse-racing. The totalisator has been adopted in S.A.
W.A., Q., and M.L., and should be adopted in N.S.W.’
because it is worked on a business-like basis ; because its
doings are always before the public eye in the bright
light of day; because it stops men from betting* unless
they have the cash in hand to plank down on the spot *
and because all these things favor the restriction of the
success of Ikey Mo, sport’s greatest parasite. It is idle to
hope that the totalisator, ostensibly fair and safe as it is
will extinguish the hungry man with the large lungs and
nose, because the whole history of betting evidences the
conceit and stupidity of backers in general. But the ex-
thieves, confidence-men, “guns” and touts, which in
such great measure make up the tribe of Ikey, will receive
a big set-back all the same.

Doubts as to Newhaven’s staying power induced
“bookies” to generously take a slight shade of odds
about his chance for the Spring Stakes (R miles) in which
he was opposed by a field of seven fair performers. The
son of Newminster, however, soon set these doubts at
rest by winning with ridiculous ease by three lengths in
the fast time, 2min. 37sec. The shapely chestnut is a
gem of the first water, and the V.R.C. Derby looks at his
mercy—unless Resolute has trained on into the smasher
his admirers allege. Newhaven’s impost in Melb. Cup is
7st. 131 b., but he is such a good colt that he mav possibly
emulate the “ double ” deeds of Grand Flaneur and
Martini Henry.
The A. J.C. Derby was a simple farce resolving
itself into a six-furlong sprint in which Charge just
managed by a head on the post to pip Coil, who ran the
last five furlongs in decidedly faster time than did the
winner. In a quick-run race Coil may do much better
and his V.R.C. Derby chance is not altogether hopeless’
though he has to meet such a topsawyer as Newhaven’
The jockeys, being hampered with waiting orders, started
off at a hack-canter, and the mile and a-half took 3min.
14sec. To avert such ridiculous exhibitions a time limit
had better be instituted as in Melb. Champion Stakes.
Poor time, poor money !
The honors of Epsom Handicap belong to the
two “ponies,” Steward and Dalmeny, who fought out an
exciting- finish. The hot favorite, Hopscotch, never
flattered the hopes o! his backers, whilst the erstwnue
Melb. Cup favorite, Reka, only managed to struggle home
amongst the first dozen. Backers were all out m their
calculations, the prophets were floored to a man, ana
Ikey Mo and Co. had a real good race. At the Clubs, on
the eve of the race, 20 to 1 went begging about the
winner, and 12 to 1 was on offer against Dalmeny.
Condition is everything, and to their excellent
fettle Steward and Dalmeny owe their forward positions
in Epsom. Le Yar, Reka, and Hopscotch can all be made
lbs. better by work and time. The latter, when lie won
last year, was trained to the hour, and he ran his best
races at this meeting, Melb. attempts proving gruesome
failures. This year things may alter. Bst. 71b. is a handy
weight for the son of Grand Flaneur to carry in Melb.
Cup, and, despite his disgrace last year, he may be very
prominent this time. Racing is a curious game.
Charge and Cartridge have begun the season
well for their sire, the expatriated Carbine, and when
Cartridge has finished his racing career he should prove a
worthy substitute at the stud for ’Stralia’s_ departed idol,
as his breeding on dam’s (St. Odille’s) side is all that could
be desired. Another son of Carbine called Pinfire (out of
Needle) is in training at Caulfield, and is spoken of as
shaping splendidly ; but, being very unfinished and back-
ward, he is not to be raced till the autumn.
The popular fancy for Melb. Cup, Toreador,
completely disgraced himself in the Trial Stakes on Satur-
day. The winner, Rackarock (Grandmaster-Wildfire),
may be dangerous about Cup-time, as he has privately
shown his party that he can stay, and 7st. 131 b. is not
much for a good 6-year-old.
By grasping at the shadow the Clark syndicate
possibly threw away the substance, for had Le Var been
started in the Derby to ensure a strong pace for Coil, the
son of Abercorn might have won. By the way, Le Yar
was badly served in the Epsom, and, under the circum-
stances, his performance (third) was full of merit.
Mr. Sam Hordern’s English purchases, the two
St. Simon sires Haut Brion and Gigue, arrived in Sydney,
and were duly quarantined on Monday last. Gigue is only
four years old, and, through his dam, has the famous
Stockwell and Scottish Chief blood. A beautifully-bred
two-year-old filly by Prince Rudolph (by Prince Charlie,
sire of Lochiel) from Angola by Macheath (one of the
highest-tried and best-performing two-year-olds ever
raced in England), and another well-bred mare, Meridian,
accompany the stallions. •By the way, Haut Brion is sure
to be known as “ O’Brien,” and his stock will no doubt be
named Dooley, Finnigan, O’Hegarty, and so on.
Duhallow is doing good work at Caulfield, and
his crowd think that he will avenge Tim Swiveller’s un-
lucky disqualification by winning Caulfield Cup.
* * * *
The Metropolitan was yet another boil-over—
Skipper, the winner, which went out at very long odds,
beating True Blue by half-a-length. Owner Hordern must
have had a big win.
In reserving Response for the Metropolitan, in
which she ran third, instead of runningher for the Epsom,
Mr. O’Brien apparently made a mistake, as on her recent
running she would have about landed the Epsom.
To-day (Saturday) Toreador may show up better
than he did last week in the Trial Stakes as the Rand-
wick Plate, three miles, will be more to his liking. Should
he win, his early Melb. Cup backers will once more take
heart.
* * * »
The news so freely bruited about that champion
Wallace has gone amiss is not unexpected to those who
saw the gruellings he got at the last V.R.C. and A. J.O.
Autumn Meetings. Horses are but horses, and not
machines.
* * * *
On the day of the Epsom the best price to be got
in Melb. about Wild Olive was 6 to 1, Dalmeny fours, and
there were tons of money laid out at these prices. “Vat a
marchin ” for the Melb. layers to work on through their
pals in Sydney!
* * * *
Not the first time this year that a steward has
upset a strong public fancy. On a certain Australian
suburban course The Bulletin wots of, if the stewards’
fancy earn get within half a length of the actual winner,
those “in the know” back the actual second to get the
race, and are almost invariably justified by the verdict.
* * * *
Cartridge, on his breeding, ought to be the
fastest nnler in Australia. By Carbine-St. Odille, a mare
that always raced away in front of the field, and never
began to come back to them till the 8-furlong post was
passed.

It never rains but it pours. Millers lost about
a score of races in succession, then won a treble and
double at two consecutive meetings.

R. H. Walne, a Brisbane man, sft. Bin. high
lOst 61b. weight, and 23 years of age, shared with Davison
the honors of the recent N.S.W. cycling carnival. He is
a bridge carpenter by trade ; began cycling 11 years ago,
but did not race until 12 months since. When Martin
(Martin once more!—can’t be helped) was beating all
Q ; > Walne, with 110 yd. start, was beaten by the great
Bill in the mile by a few inches on the post. And he
rode two or three other plucky seconds to Martin
Walne’s biggest prize-money was £l2 for first place
m the three-mile race on St. Patrick’s Day in Brisbane
until he annexed one of the £5O prizes at the last big
Sydney meeting. His machine, geared to 92 and weigh-
ing 261 b., is the work of a Brisbane maker.

Tasmania has two Axemen’s Associations—one
a limited co. of axemen and others, the other a co of

hardly discernible at a distance, as both advertise bin-
chopping prizes in Oct. and Nov.

Melbourne cyclists thus far have not been able
to wreak much iegal vengeance upon the larrikin w'ho
runs them down with or without malice aforethought.
The other Sabbath a drunken fellow drove his vehicle
against a girl on a bike, injuring the damsel and destroy-
ing the machine. A fine of £lO was considered to meet
the requirements of that case. Later a race between two
milk carts resulted in the demolition of another bike and
the crippling of the rider for life, it is said. The boy jehu
responsible for the damage was let off with a IDs. fine
for the sake of the alleged aged mother dependant on his
wild career. In this case the soft-hearted magistrates
might as well have sent round the hat on behalf of the
cripple who, also the sole support of a mother, employed
his bike in his daily business. But, perhaps, the average
foot passenger in Melbourne has .so many narrow escapes
from being hiked whilst crossing streets that he feels
little sympathy with his natural enemy even when the
enemy is brought to undeserved grief. The bicvcle is
made for the roadway, but the road wasn’t created for
“scorching” purposes. At present a cvclist, being
tolerated rather than sanctified, rides at his own peril in
a great measure, as well as at the peril of pedestrians—
and W. R. Wilson’s racehorses.

The Cooper-Sanger mile contests for ,£2OO,
Cooper winning the first in lmin. 58 2-ssecs., and the
second in 1 58 3-ssecs., by half a wheel, show what
crack racing is in America.
* * * *
The starting-machine is good, but it needs
rational administration. Thusfar—in Victoria, at any
rate—the starter who directs the business has been bound
down to the rule that the machine can do no wrong, and
the most absurd accidents have happened now and then
to destroy the chances of certain horses. At Caulfield,
the other Saturday, an impetuous animal butted at the
rope just as the barrier was ascending, and held one end
of it down for a moment. The other end of the barrier
went up all right enough, and most of the field departed
as per usual, leaving at the post four unfortunates that
couldn’t get away. It stands to reason that the starter
should have authority to call them back in such a case
but under present arrangements he is a mere dummy star-
ing at the injustice he has innocently wrought. The
notorious suspension of Chris. Moore for “ deliberately
getting left at the post ” on Quiver in the V.R.C. Oaks',
was brought about by the starting-machine. The thin<>
was then a novelty at Flemington. Quiver thrust her nose
into the rope barrier, and played up considerably, and
when the barrier rose her head was turned the wrong way
Everybody in the stand supposed that the start was a
false one, and Moore seemingly expected the rest of the
field to be called back to Quiver. But old George Watson
had no say in the matter, it seemed. A machine-made
start is final. When the barrier goes up, properly or
otherwise, the race has commenced and nobody can stop
it. If the first half-dozen favorites for a Melb. Cup were
to get entangled in the ropes—well, their owners and
backers would be in the soup without legal <>Tound for
protest. °

The bicycle is diminishing the receipts of racing

The second half-yearly vol. of J. J. Miller’s
Australian Racing Chronicle—Feb. to July—contains
full details of 700 meetings, nearly twice as many as the
more expensive Australasian Turf Register included for
the whole year 1895-96. As evidence that Miller’s up-to-
date Chronicle, published in monthly and half-yearly
numbers, fills a long-felt want, a correspondent furnishes
some particulars re a racing-sire named Sunrise. The
Australasian Register credited Sunrise aforesaid with 26
winners of 48 races (value £1695) for the whole of last
year. Miller’s books, covering the same period, reveal
Sunrise as the sire of 46 winners of 144 races, 104 seconds
and 90 thirds, totalling £3OOO in stakes. Little things
like this explain why the Argus refuses to advertise the
Racing Chronicle in its respectable columns.

“ Do racing-men live long ? ” asks a bookmakers
journalist in an Ikey-Mo organ. After which he proceed'
to mention a few early-rising sports of mature age, and
argues therefrom that a successful gambling career is ex-
ceedingly healthy. (Men aren’t vigorous because thev
rise early—they rise early because they are vigorous.) Of
course, racing-men, as a rule, don’t live long if they have
a constantly exciting time. Neither do brokers—of shares
sugar, spices, or any other goods—make very old bones!
Speculation leads to drink, and drink increases speculation
and both things are bad for the nervous system, and all
nervousness points deathward, and—well, the gambler
stands to get cut down like a cauliflower. The average
parson can give a bookmaker 20 years and a beating.
Preaching is a healthy pursuit.

When the famed athlete, Donald Dinnie, first
struck Ballarat, he was accorded a wondrous welcome by
the Scoatish community, every member of which left his
pants at home in honor of the occasion and swelled tbe
air with “ Hech gathers” and “We are nae fou ” foi
hours at a stretch. But the hero of the occasion re-
sponded very little to the perfervid enthusiasm, and re-
ceived the homage of the crowd without as much as a
nod of acknowledgment. At last, when the reception
committee approached him, he condescended to admit
that it was braw the day, and on the chairman proposing
a visit to the nearest bar, Donald acquiesced without a
murmur. “We weell dreenk to the health o’ the greatest
o Scoatish wroslers,” announced the chairman to every-
body’s surprise, for he was locally noted as being' a very
“ adjacent” Caledonian indeed. “ What’ll ye be takken,
Mister Deenee ? ” “ Wull,” mused Donald, stroking his
square jaw, “ A’m theenkin’ A’ll be takkin a sma’ bottle
o’ champagne.” The chairman nearly fell down, but he
paid-up like a little man, though his belief in the athletes
of his native land was shattered for evermore.

Altogether, the cyclist bites as often as he is
bitten in Sydney city traffic, and when he adopts the
ammonia pistol, the facetious driver of a vehicle will
smile at a respectful distance, instead of urging his horse
to climb upon the cyclist’s back. But what a bad time
the average Sydney citizen gets ! He is the “game” of
the scorcher, the driver, the spitter, the stick or parasol-
flourisher, the smoker, the ehewer, and the leprous-
handed person who mauls the loaf at luncheon.

Dear Bulletin, —Riding along a macadamised
road in the “ cookies’ country,” up the western line, a
peculiar, and to us a novel, “ track” was observable. My
companion, a mulga-fed cattle-man, for the first time
emerged from the scrubs to the west of the Q’sland
Warrego, was mightily puzzled. Horse, cattle, emu,
gohanna—or any decent tracks —you couldn’t have put
him wrong about. But this slewed him. “ It’s the denied
sea-serpent come ashore !”he at last decided. He had
read a newspaper or two in his time. The trail of a
pneumatic tyre is a weird affair to the back-blocks bush-
man when he drops on it for the first time.—Breaker.

Dear Bulletin, —“ K.” is right about roping.
In Lahore I saw an officer and a gentleman (!) prepared
with a vet.’s certificate that his mare had ophthalmia and
could not run. He had been unable to buy her in the
lotteries. The public (army men) insisted on his allowing
her to go and letting S ,of the 82nd, ride her. She
won easily. The same o. and g. rode for me once, and
was 10 lengths ahead at the distance and 20 behind
at the winning-post. He had then bought the winner in
the sweeps the night previous to the race. I think he is
now a retired colonel, and still an officer and a gentleman.
I am not.— S. the W.

Nat. Thompson, the old-time N.S.W. .cricketer
just dead, and Dave Gregory, another old-timer, now high
up in N.S.W. Civil Service, once had a tiff. Dave had a
peculiar style of bowling—half a throw it was called. Nat.
was standing umpire in a match on the old Albert Ground,
Dave bowling. Nat. “no-balled” him once! twice!!
thrice .. ! Round went Dave’s arm for another bowl.
No ball,” cried Nat. “ Why,” said Dave, “ I haven’t
bowled yet”—which was a fact. He made pretence of
bowling, but held the ball fast. Nat. umpired no more
that day.

At an Ulmarra(N.S.W.) pony-meeting, Aug. 23,
sornfe of the cronkest running ever seen in the district
took place, and the committee let things slide. Some of
the settling was also very crooked. One punter so badly
battered the features of a bookie who failed to ante-up
that the erring one’s own mother would not have known
him.

Dear Bulletin, — Be a Bulletin par. saying that
boat-builder Dan Shea was 40 years before his day. The
Arabs can give even Dan a bit of a start. Last year, at
Aden, I saw an old dhow hauled up on the beach, built
after the shape which has not been altered a hair’s-breadth
by the Arabs for the last thousand years. Razee the
cumbersome poop, bolt on the lead, and there was the
exact model of the modern English yacht. Truly, there
is nothing new under the sun.—W.

Jran Mace is still a factor in the business of the
much-barmaided Melbourne pub. which he ran long years
ago. Every now and then an inferior new-chum johnnie,
or Cockney spieler, swaggers into Jem’s old shop with a
benediction from the ex-bruiser, who has adjured the
visitor, before leaving London, to make this his first place
of call. The pub. seems a queer sort of Mecca for pil-
grims nowadays, but in Mace’s time it was occasionally a
scene of prodigal expenditure. Gilded youths, excited
by the proud consciousness of having known the boss
“at Honie, doncherknow,” would order champagne ad
lib., whereupon Jem would pour the contents of many
bottles into a bucket until it was so full that the crowd,
kneeling around, were able to drink, horse-fashion, with-
out wetting their noses. Jem artfully insisted that the
special glory of the draught lay in their ability to imbibe
without tilting the bucket or wetting their noses, to which
end it was necessary to keep the river of fizz running a
banker —just as long as the gilded youths would supply
the funds.


Irritating and Disfiguring
ERUPTIONS
On the Face, Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy
Maher, Fitzroy, Victoria, whose portrait
we are privileged to give below:
“ I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
I had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my face, and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

A Hobart cabman was lately “ pulled ” for
not walking round the corner. “Now, do you
mean to tell me,” said the prosecutor, “that you
have been driving in Hobart for 17 years and can-
not swear that you knew there was a sign on that
corner ordering drivers to ‘walk round the
corner . “ Well,” said accused, “I ’aven’t been
drivin round that corner for 17 years.”
At Stawell (Vic.), the other day, an inquest
was held on the body of a poor tramp, found dead
somewhere or other, and the doctor certified that
pneumonia was the cause of his passing hence.
Ihe only property left by the deceased was a
microscopic swag containing a pair of slippers and
a knife and fork. At this point the coroner ex-
plained to the jurymen that it was their duty to
decide as to the cause of death, and that they might
ask any questions which would tend to elucidate
matters. Then the fat, heavy juryman upheaved
himself and inquired : “ What was the color of the
handle of the fork found in the man’s swag ? ”
A male mother is an extreme rarity. Re-
cently a Paris medical student, 17 years old, re-
ceived a slight blow in the navel region of the
abdomen, and a swelling formed which in two
years reached the size of a child’s head. An
operation by Mayde and Sanger brought to light
a female foetus apparently about five months old.
The head was rather badly deformed, but the
limbs were almost regular in shape. The skin was
somewhat wrinkled and thickened, but the hair
was regularly localised and actually a foot long.
This was one of those extremely rare cases of
twins in which one is absolutely enclosed in the
other. The gradations of twinning are separate
twins, Siamese twins, twins divided from the
waist up or from the waist down, two-headed
person, included twin as in this case. The 'Jour-
nal DE Medecine DE Paris (a periodical equal in
standing to the Lancet or the British Medical
Journal) is the authority for the above.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
“ White-Eye ” to The Bulletin :—“ One
of the largest S.A. cattle-stations has lately, from
motives of economy, given up the old style of
branding calves in a yard, and taken to the Yankee
style of branding them in the bush. The lasso is
fastened to the horse by an ordinary pack-surcingle,
buckled tight around the horse’s girth over the
saddle. (It is surprising how a small horse, with
a man on his back, can hold a full-grown beast.)
Pour posts are put in the ground—two long ones
and two short ones. The long ones are put in
about 3ft. 6in. apart, and the short ones about 4ft.
or sft. from the long ones, all in a straight line.
When the man with the lasso has caught a calf he
drags it up towards the posts and rides between
the two long posts till the calf is level with them.
The calf is then leg-roped and thrown in the usual
way. When it is branded and the ropes taken off
the fun begins. If the calf happens to be a big
Mick, you will see the men working the leg-ropes
all rushing for the two long posts, and, in their
hurry, they generally make for the same post with
the Mick at their heels. The new style has not
caught on in the district, and I don’t think it will
last where they are using it, as it makes cattle j
very wild.” |

I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline

I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, . Spring Vale
I have much pleasure in testifying to the real merits of your “ Bioplastine.” After using all other remedies for a
number of years I unhesitatingly give this the preference. My neuralgia has departed and my nerves made strons-
I have induced several persons to give your tonic a trial, with very gratifying results. One lady, a sufferer from
indigestion, felt quite a new creature after taking one bottle of “ Bioplastine.”

Walter Scott, cousin of the novelist, was
a middy, and with two others had a spree at a
low-down Portsmouth groggery, compiling such a
score that the landlady locked them up. She
would only let them go on condition of marriage
with one, because she wanted a certificate. They
cast lots, and Walter won, or lost. He married
her. At Jamaica he was overjoyed with the news

After a long and acrimonious discussion of
the qualifications of competing architects, a Vic.
congregation not long ago built a church which
may be simply described as a six-sided building
with many turrets, a high roof, a sloping floor, and
seats circled round the pulpit. The night before
the opening somebody painted on the new notice-
board in flaring red: “THIS CYCLORAMA
WILL BE OPENED TO-DAY WITH THE
SIEGE OF HELL,” which was only the begin-
ning of trouble. The worshippers found that
unless the church was full it was almost impossible
for a preacher to be heard. The regular minister
was the only one who could make anything like a
decent oratorical appearance. Unfortunate visitors
were staggered to find the building flinging back at
their heads the beginning of a trisyllable word
when they were uttering its last syllable. They
usual’y became annoyed and spoke loudly
to drown the echo; which merely resulted in
other echoes crowding to aid the first one and
piling themselves on to the perspiring parson
till there was none of his voice left. Each
member of the vestry had a different theory
a ; to the cause of the echo, and proposed an ap-
propriate remedy. W i res were stretched across
the vaulted ceiling until it looked like the interior
of a telephone exchange; curtains were hung
round the walls—the echo came up smiling. The
architect disclaimed all responsibility ; according to
architectural laws, he said, the church was of per-
fect acoustic construction. And, with every seat
occupied, the acoustics were perfect. But the
parson and the vestry couldn’t fill ’em. Hiring an
audience was suggested ; but, as it was not to be
supposed that the subsidised portion of the con-
gregation would return their subsidy to the offer-
tory, this plan was out of the range of ecclesiasti-
cal economics. But the other day a bright genius
evolved an alternative scheme of filling all the
seats with indiarubber dummies. These dummies
might be manufactured to represent very pious,
bald-headed old gentlemen. Five hundred could
be procured' at a reasonable cost. Each dummy
must be made collapsable, and when the wind had
been taken out of him he could be folded up upon
the seat, thus making a cushion for the intending
worshipper. The organ bellows could be utilised
to pump air into main pipes beneath the floor ;
from these mains, smaller pipes would carry the
air up from under the seats to each figure. Half-
an-hour or so before service the beadle must con-
nect the organ bellows with the main, and start
the gas-engine, when a magnificent congregation
of bald-headed old gentlemen would rise like one
man and kill the echo. Seat-holders coming in
had only to turn a convenient tap at the back of a
bald-headed gentleman’s neck, place a hand upon
his head, gently squash him out of existence, and
sit upon his collapsed carcase. The ushers in
similar manner could make room for strangers.
It was true the dummies could give no col-
lection, but neither could they put buttons
in the plate, nor display any inattention
nor sleepiness during the sermon. It might
be objected that they could not rise to
sing, but that difficulty might easily be obviated
by the whole congregation remaining seated
thoughout the service, and there would always be
a good congregation to cheer the parson’s heart—
not a single seat would ever be vacant. When
The Bulletin mail left, the vestrymen were on
the point of adopting this ingenious solution of
their acoustic difficulty ; and news of its success is
anxiously awaited.

1 AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow awaj'. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

Beware of IroitatioQS!
The Last of the Pirates,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“One of Crocky Dixon’s lot, eh? ’Pon
my soul, it’s very kind of Gorman to say so—
especially as the old villain himself’s got a lot
more the cut of a buccaneer than I have. ”
f looked up at the bridge, and compared the
bull - roaring skipper fiery- faced and shock-
bearded—witli the man beside me—lean, clean,
bi'own, and civil.
“Appearances don’t go for much,” I said.
“ Crocky himself, I understand ”
“ Didn’t look the part, eh ? Well, that’s so.
Ladies’ hosiery, or barber’s clerk—that was about
his mark, by the outside of him ! ”
“You did know him, then? ”
The lean man stretched himself out in his deck-
chair. “ Well, yes. In fact, I was in a sense, as
Gorman says, one of Crocky’s lot. Much against
my will, though. And I was with him at the
end.”
“At the end! Why—but perhaps you’re
Kirby?”
“Mr. Adam Kirby, sir ! —at your service.”
“Oh! of course. But, you see, you’re histori-
cal.”
“Or you want to make me so—isn’t that it?
But you’ve heard the story before?”
“ In half-a-dozen versions. That’s why I’d be
glad of a first-hand account.”
Kirby looked at his watch. “Got to muster
my coolies on deck in half-an-hour. Just about
time for the yarn. (Hi! steward !) What’ll you
take?”
* » » *
“You see, Crocky wanted to be up to
date. That old schooner of his was a wonder to
sail ; but, now that both Dutch and English
cruisers were on the look-out for him, he thought
it was time he had a smoke-pot of his own. I
needn’t go over the nabbing of the Hija de la Mar.
The Straits papers had that all right enough
except that they said she was a good lump of a
steamer. She was only a 60ft. Barrow - built
launch, sent out for Pareras of Manila. / ought
to know! ”
“Yes ; you were her engineer, weren’t you ? ”
“ Engineer of a hooker like that ! Not likely.
But I was going to Mindando, myself, and Jose
Parera asked me to run the Hija down for him.
And how Crocky nailed us and marooned ’em all
but me, of course you know. ”
“ Yes ! But why did he except you ? ”
“ Because there were fixtures about the steam-
gear that puzzled him—new-fangled touches that
made him think he’d got hold of a 20-knotter or
thereabouts. Sixteen she was credited with on
the measured mile, but 14 was all I could knock
out of her, with Crocky’s pistol at my ear to help
me. ‘ And that’s her top-notch, is it ? ’ says he at
last. ‘ With better coal,’ I told him, ‘ and a few
inches more down-by-the-stern, I might squeeze
another knot out of her—not more.’ ‘ Call it 13,
as a general thing,’he says. ‘Too much for the
Dutchie, or for anything the Britishers hev got in
these hyar waters.’ ‘Yes; but what about the
Spaniards ? ’ I says. ‘ You’ve put your foot in it
propexly now with them too.’ ‘ Shucks ! ’he says,
and walks away aft, full of a notion that many a
Yankee and Johnny Bull has come to grief over
before now. Got the same idea yourself, as like as
not! ”
“ And that is ? ”
“ That the Spaniards are poor, God-forsaken
creatures—not much account, afloat or ashore!
Anyhow, I could see Dixon knew nothing of the
new 18-knot cruiser that had arrived at Manila the
day we left it. She’d be after us by that time, I
expected; but, of course, I said nothing to
Ci-ocky. Sixteen of his men he had with him ;
the best, I suppose, in his estimation —which
meant pretty well the biggest scoundrels. And
the nearest thing to a white man among ’em was a
bi k- cross-eyed Portuguese, with a touch of the
tar-brush.
“ About latitude we were in; and, as we
headed away due east, I fancied Dixon was
making for the Carolines. I kept looking him
over, as he sat on the skylight witn a yellow-back
novel and a bottle of poor Parera’s Medoc, and I
couldn’t bring myself to believe he was such a
savage devil as he was made out. But I soon got
an eye-opener.
“We fell in with a little green-painted brig, head-
ingnor’-west— cocoa-nut oil, I heard afterwards, she
had, from the islands for Canton—and Crocky
runs alongside and boards her with all his cut-
throats but two. What happened in the brig’s
cabin, I don’t exactly know—or wbat Crocky took
from the tomato-faced old skipper, but, when we
had cast off and the brig had filled her maintop-
sail again, the skipper runs to the taffrail and
shakes his fist at Crocky. * You infernal Yankee
robber ! ’ he yells— ‘ you’ll pay for this, as sure as
my name’s’ what his name was I didn’t hear,
for just then Crocky fired. The old chap stood for
a bit with his fist stretched out—then down he
went in a heap. ‘ Thought I’d missed, didn’t
you ? ’ Dixon says to me, in a voice like a girl at
a tea-party, but I could see, from the looks of his
men, that his claws were out.
“ Presently he walks up to the chap at the wheel
—a half-caste Dutchman, by the look of him—
and not well used, I could see, to have the spokes
of a steamer in his flippers. Dixon just looks at
the compass, and, without a single word, catches
the man a crasher on the head with his revolver-
butt. Then he looks round—the smallest man
aboard, with a pleasant little smile on his smooth
little face. ‘ Take the wheel. Miguel,’ he says to
the big Portuguese—-‘and heave this thing over
the side, a couple of you.’ Now, the man was
only stunned—l could see his chest heaving as
they got him up on the rail, and I called out
before I could help it, ‘ Good God ! he’s not dead ! ’
Next second a bullet scored the top of the topee
I had on, and, says Crocky—smiling more beauti-
fully than ever—‘ Six inches lower next time.’
“ Well, sir, there must be some such thing as
Fate, after all. I believe it was this man’s doom
that drove him into such sudden ferocity. At all
events, it was the shooting of the red-faced skipper
that brought the cruiser down on us. The mate
of the brig kept her away from the Philippines to
report the matter, and what does he drop across,
six hours later, but the Spanish war-ship, pegging
away to the s’uth’ard, on the chance that Dixon
would make for some out-of-the-way hole in
northern Gilolo. Away comes the Don, then—
dead in our wake, with every ounce of steam he
could carry ; and, sure enough, next morning at
sunrise there was a little inky smear going up out
of the blue behind us. Crocky hardly took his
eye off it for an hour, and when he found it was
rising and spreading, he comes to me and says—
‘ Drive her ! ’ Not a word more; but you bet I
did drive her for all she was worth,
The narrator pulled up to irrigate, and I said —
“Couldn’t you have sent something astray with
your engines, on the quiet ? ”
“Wouldn’t be sitting here, yarning, to-day, if
I had ! Crocky knew a heap too much for that!
And, anyhow, it wasn’t needed. The stranger
steering for our smoke, of course—hove herself up
so fast over the horizon that I knew she must be
the new cruiser, the Cid Campeador. But still I
said nothing, and when Crocky handed me the
glass—saying he didn’t know her—l said I didn’t,
either. ‘ She kin travel a few—whatever she is ! ’
I heard him mutter. ‘ Keep her at it ! ’ he says to
me, with a tap on his pistol. ‘ And you, Miguel—
steady as you go ! ’ Then he went below.
“I suppose he still thought he’d an off-chance
of making the Carolines; in fact, I fancied,
myself, it was about time we were sighting some
of the little outlying western islands. But the
way the Don overhauled us was a caution, and, as
soon as he was near enough to show us the white-
ness about his forefoot, he let drive at us. ‘ Long
way short, my boy ! ’ I says to myself, but I
hadn’t reckoned on the latest touch in guns—the
shot pitched a good half-mile ahead of us ! Up
comes Crocky when he hears the boom, and down
he smashes his glass on deck when he makes out
the stranger’s ensign. ‘ Great Jefferson ! ’ he says
—‘ yellow-bellies, after all! ’ He took a turn or
two fore and aft, and I noticed that his pockets
were bulging with something that made him very
heavy in the walk. Then comes another shot—
not 10 feet above our smoke-stack —and at the
screech of it Crocky seems to go clean mad. He
pulls a seven-shot Colt out of each bi-east pocket—
fires at Miguel—and, as the big Portuguese falls
over the wheel, whips round and pots five of his
other men before the rest could rush him. A long
buck-nigger was the first to handle the little demon,
but, as he lay under the black man, he managed
somehow to fire another shot that set the man’s
shirt on fire and blew away part of his jaw, In
the middle of the shooting 1 had stopped the en-
gines, and, when I turned round, there was the
big nigger—with the blood pouring from his
smashed face —just forcing Crocky over the rail.
His pockets sunk him like lead.” 1
“ What was in them ? ”
“ Dollars ! I fancy he intended to sink himself
with them, anyhow, after he’d polished off his
whole crew. But now there were nine of ’em
left, and when they missed the throb of the screw
they came for me like one man. But I fought ’em
with what no man can face —steam ! —and scalded
three of them so badly that they jumped over-
board and sank within twenty yards of the cruiser’s
boat, pulling up hard. Two of the others fired
into her, and killed a seaman at his oar. That’s
what made the garotte a certainty for them, in
any case ! ”
“ Had a middling close shave of it yourself, by
some accounts?”
Kirby laughed as he jumped up. “ Not quite
so bad as that. But, you see, I’d been seventy-
odd hours without sleep or shaveI—thick 1 —thick with
grease and coal-dust, besides ; no wonder the
Spanish lieutenant took me for what I looked
like. But when I got aboard the Cid it was all
right. The captain spoke English, and as soon as
I had got freshened up a bit, he sent me back
with half-a-dozen of his marineros to run the
Hija into Manila.
“ And, after I’d given evidence against the five
remaining picaroons—who, by the way, were all
duly scragged—l asked for this ’’—Kirby lugged
out a long Colt “ navy ” —“ as a little memento of
the ‘ Last of the Pirates.’ ”
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
At Maryborough (Q.)Police-court. Colored
gentleman was charged with drunkenness and
pleaded guilty. P.M. : “ How is it that you get
drunk when you are a Buddhist ? That is con-
trary to your religious belief. Are you a Bud-
dhist ? ” Prisoner : “ No, lam a Christian.” The
P.M. : “ Well, I suppose you are at liberty to get
drunk if you are a Christian ! You are dis-
charged.” John left the courthouse smiling : he
had found there was something in Christianity,
after all.
Dear Bulletin,— Talking about the luck
of drunken men. Brown Jones was a north Clunes
miner, a Durham beer-sinker; he was in the habit of
going home drunk, and falling down a precipitous
and rocky hill on the way to save a walk round. He
fell down this hill probably a dozen times without
sustaining any injuries worth mentioning, when
under the elevating influence. When sober Brown
Jones never took the hill route, regarding it as
dangerous, till one evening, being in a particular
hurry, he attempted it without the usual buoyancy
imparted by Ballarat beer. He slipped and fell,
and was carried home badly broken, and the local
members of the Royal Orange Lodge had a full-
dress outing at his funeral on the following Sun-
day.—Yours, Snell. P.S.— The temperance
societies are at liberty to make what use they
please of this anecdote. —S.
At the Army.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The excitement was at its height. Captain Mac-
intosh had finished singing “Nearer, my God, to
Thee,” with acrobatic leaps at the conclusion ; but
Lieutenant Hilda Smith was still swinging her
arms about, and inviting the boys to chuck then-
sovereigns to their Saviour. The body of the hall
was a dim mass, lit up by waving handkerchiefs
and alive with yelling voices. It was a friendly,
appreciative audience at the Army that night, not
a gathering of “ toffs ” come to grin and contemn.
“ God will take away your sins,” cried Captain
Macintosh, walking up and down ; “ God ’ll do it
right away ; there’s nothing impossible to God.”
Suddenly a new speaker leapt fx-om among the
flags and cymbals at the rear of the platform.
“ Glory to God!” he shouted : “ I’m six months
old to-day ! ”
He was a middle-aged man, small-made, but
evei-y inch of him alive. His step was firm, his
eyes alight with l-eligious fervor, but to the
initiated gaze there was a world of meaning in
the straggling black beard, and in the loose folds
of his ill-fitting blue jei-sey.
“Thank God for Private Jackson!” cried the
captain, and clapped him on the shoulder. Jack-
son laughed wildly, and the cymbals clanged once
more.
He turned to the audience again.
“ And why did I say I was only six months old
to-day ? Because I was dead all the years before
that, dead in my sins. But glory, glory, glory !
now I’m saved for evermore.”
“ Hallelujah ! ” shouted the captain.
“Oh ! I was a great sinner befoi-e that. Oh !
the sins I’ve done. There was one—the blackest
of them all—l won’t tell you what it was. I did
it five years ago; and oh, God ! how I’ve wept
and groaned over that sin ever since I was born
again ! ”
Suddenly his voice changed. It sank from the
usual, high-pitched Salvation tones to a lower and
a different key altogether. The effect was almost
instantaneous; in a minute the hall was like a
church.
“ Do you know it wasn’t enough for God to for-
give me that great sin ? That’s flow sinners feel,
brethren. It wasn’t near enough that He should
foi-give me. He had to make it so that it had
never been done. As Captain Macintosh has told
you, nothing is impossible to God.”
Not a sound in the hall, only a vague whisper-
ing among the lasses on the platform. Private
Jackson bent forward as if addressing the audi-
ence confidentially.
“And He did, brethren. He has turned the
whole world back five years, and so I have not
sinned that sin. Praise be to God, it is five
years, five years ago.” He straightened himself
up and shouted, with suddenly waving arms,
“All the world’s been turned back for one poor
sinner: yesterday it was 1896, and to-night it’s
1891.”
Then Captain Macintosh regained his presence
of mind, and signed the band to start up “ Sweet
Marie. ”
They had always suspected Jackson of being
“a bit off,” but it was his unorthodoxy, not his
insanity, that caused them to lay his case before
the medical authorities next day.

In one N. Queensland town it is a sort of
tradition that the local Freemasons must always
drink at a certain hotel, and no other. The origin
of the tradition is lost to the younger generation
of Masons, but the old ones tell how, years ago,
the local Grand Chief Goat, or some other poten-
tate, went into that hotel in a fearsome state of
hiccup, and backed the publican up into a corner,
and proceeded to initiate him at a fast pace into
all the different degrees in succession. He was
nearly through with the job before he was dis-
covered and removed in disgrace, and then it be-
came necessary to silence the pub.-keeper. He re-
fused to join the order, but promised inviolable
secresy if the Masons always drank at his pub.
thereafter, and they have drunk there in fear and
trembling ever since. If they stopped drinking
at his pub. the secrets of the order would be given
away to the local paper, and Freemasonry would
burst up for ever.

“Going to the Theatre."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She was a brisk little woman, with a wealth
of warm-colored hair, a trim form, and a ravishing
face. And her dress became her admirably.
Altogether a charming little figure. And she said,
“ Now, Number Sixteen, I want you to come to
the theatre with me, please.”
So I went. I rather fancy that I was not
dressed as becomingly as she was. I wore a long
flannel dressing-gown, which flapped uncomfort-
ably about my ankles, and was much too roomy
round the chest, and my hands were quite out of
sight in the sleeves of it. It was decorated with
the inscription “C 3” in big capitals across the
chest. I also wore a pair of No. 10 slippers, and
my thoughts were a good deal distracted by my
efforts to keep my feet inside them.
I had to pass eight or nine of my acquaintances
on my way to join the little woman, and several of
them said “ Good-bye, Sixteen !” Number Thir-
teen —thirteen, ugh!—said “ Good luck, old boy ! ”
To these kindly remarks I replied but briefly, for
my slippers had a little the best of me just then.
The little woman said, “You carry this can up
and I’ll take the other things.” So I took the big
hot-water can in both arms, and hugged it to my
bosom, and she took the other things and led the
way. Through the door, along the verandah, and
across a high-level bridge in the open air, where I
took, perhaps, my final look at the sunshine and
the waving trees and the grass-plots and the
flower-gardens and a little group of convalescents
standing in the sun underneath (from, whom came
the remark, “ There’s another bloke goin’ up from
C 3 ”), we walked in silence.
“ You’re lucky to be first, aren’t you ? ”
I said Yes, I was ; but I was not feeling par-
ticularly thankful, all the same. I did not say so,
however, for the dressing-gown tripped me up just
at that time, and for a few seconds I and the hot-
water can and the slippers and the dressing-gown
were badly mixed. At this episode the idlers
down below laughed, and one man said cheerfully :
“ Seems a bit funky, don’t he ? ”
My guide asked me if I had any false teeth, be-
cause I must take them out if I had, and give
them to her. I hadn’t, however; so we proceeded
without any further interruption, for I had got
used to the slippers by this time. We came
to a lofty hall, then went up a flight of stairs (the
can was getting heavy), up another flight of
stairs, and we were at “the theatre.’ Not
exactly on the stage yet, but in the green-room,
so to speak.
There was a kind of hand-waggon arrangement
here, with a bed on it at a very inconvenient height
from the floor. I had to climb into this as best I
could, and the little woman put the hot-water can
to my feet, and left me. The door through which
she passed was slightly ajar, and I had a good
view of the theatre proper, on the stage of which
I was about to make my first appearance. There
was rather a poor house when I arrived (mine was
the opening performance, you see), but the specta-
tors soon began to flock in and take their seats.
There was plenty of seating accommodation —tier
upon tier of semi-circularly-arranged benches,
reaching right up to the' roof. The audience
seemed to be in rare humor, and chatted and
laughed very cheerily. On the stage proper there
was a goodly array of accessories in the shape of
bottles and wadding and iodoform and basins and
scissors and knives and an electric-battery, and
many other bright and showy articles, but my in-
terest centred gloomily on a nice-looking young
man with a dark moustache and some very pretty
flowers in his buttonhole, who was flirting des-
perately with one of the theatre staff. (The
theatre nurses wear a red sash in addition to the
customary uniform, which strikes an interested
visitor as peculiarly appropriate and artistic —and
cheering.) The young man, I knew, was the
anae.-thetist, for he had been down-stairs earlier
in the day testing my lung and heart capacity,
and he presently came along, in company with
another nice young man, and did it again. He
tlien vanished for a space, and I lay still and
w itched the audience coming in, through the
chink in the curtain—l mean the door. But
someone shut the door, and hid stage and per-
formers and all from my view, and I was just
beginning to wish that my part in the performance-
would begin, or be unavoidably postponed, or
something, when I heard the voice of the young
man with the dark moustache behind me. He
had a funnel-shaped india-rubber thing with him,
the wide-mouthed part of which he put-over my
mouth and nose. He said :
“It may be a little bit disagreeable, but just try
to blow this full of air, will you ? ”
T bh-w. “ That’s right ! Now another ! ” I did
another. “ Now draw a long breath.”
I had to do this, anyway, for my lungs were
now empty, and I began to “tumble ” to the nice
young man’s craftiness. For the long breath I
drew in nearly choked me, and I felt as if I was
drowning. I held out for a long time, so as not to
have to take another swallow like it, but I had to
give in at last, and this time inhaled a rather
worse dose than before. After that, I refrained
from breathing until I nearly exploded, and then
I had to take a big gulp that made me feel as if I
was being smothered under ten thousand feather-
beds scented with druggists’ sundries. I began to
hear a singing as of tree-locusts in summer-time,
continuous and increasing, mingled with the roar-
ing of a far-away ocean. Then a voice a long way
off said, “ Long breaths, and don’t talk 1 ” I was
just about to reply that I had neither desire nor
intention to talk, when the locusts suddenly
stopped singing, and the ocean burst with a loud
bang.
* * * *
Ward () 3 was as bright and cheerful as
ever. Its 32 windows let in plenty of light, and
the furniture and glass and brasswork shone
beautifully. There was a nice fire in the middle
of the room, and half-a-dozen of the lodgers were
sitting round it, yarning. Some of the other
fellows were sitting up in their beds, reading, and
everything looked peaceful and pleasant. But
how the dickens did I come there? How was it I
was in bed ? What was the last thing I remem-
bered ? Where ?
I sat up in bed. “ Hello, you fellows,” I said ;
“ where am I ? ”
“ Sixteen’s woke up,” said the one-legged man
opposite ; “ how are you, old boy ? ”
But a nurse came along. “You lie down at
once,” she said ; “ and don’t move ! ”
She put a pillow under my head (there was none
there) and took away my old friend, the hot-water
can, which I now perceived had been at my feet.
A beautiful creature was serving out the bread
and butter and tea which formed the evening
meal. When she was passing by me, I said—
“ Can’t I have some, nurse ? ”
“Nothing for you till to-morrow, Sixteen,” she
replied, cruelly.
.** * *
There was a rumble along the verandah
outside. “ Here comes Fourteen ! ” said the
loungers round the fire. The elevated bed on
wheels was trundled in, and along to Fourteen’s
quarters. Fourteen was lying very, very still.
His head was thrown back, and his mouth was
open, and his face was very white. There were
two men in charge of his carriage, and they lifted
him off (my goodness, how limp he was !) laid him
on his bed, and rumbled out again with the
waggon. A nurse piled blankets on top of Four-
teen, and put a hot water-can to his feet, and took
away his pillow, and placed a little basin on the
locker at his bed-head. I looked at my bed-head :
there was a similar little basin there—it was use-
ful, as Fourteen could have told you, half-an-hour
later.
And now I knew how I had come back from the
theatre.
A. CHEE.
All things would. be pure to the pure, if
there were any pure.—
“To the pure all things are pure.”
That’s a maxim safe and sure—
Naught seems naughty, wrong, or rude
In the Trilby figure nude
To the eye of humankind
Beaming from a spotless mind :
Ne’er a pose appeared obscene
Till our Parents wore the green.
Uoni soit —you know the rest.
Eve and Adam went undrest,
Innocent of thoughts salacious
(If the Bible be veracious)
Ere the serpentining Devil
Breathed the cursed name of evil;
Then the lady gave a start
And felt she was indeed a “tart.”
“ To the pure all things are pure.”
Truth almighty shall endure,
Holy sir, and righteous madam,
Long as faith in Eve and Adam.
Find a woman, and a man,
Such as were when Time began ;
Set ’em up and ask us whether
They are chaste in “ altogether.”
We will say, with humor grim,
All is pure to her and him.
But that’s a question quite apart
From purity in naked Art.

Dear Bulletin, — Be the Japanese clerk
advts. in the Eastern press. I am staying for a
few days at a Gerald ton (W.A.) hotel which em-
ploys a Japanese clerk, two Jap. cooks, Jap. boots,
Jap. yardman, and Jap. lie-chambermaid. There
are Jap. fruit-shops, carpenter shops, laundries,
Ac., &c., here ; also, several establishments run by
lady Japs., who have almost driven the white
women out of competition in the one avocation to
which the former entirely confines herself in this
country. Many of the Japs, ride cycles, and it is
said they intend going in for football and cricket.
[The only count in the present indictment, so far,
calculated to infuriate Australia.—El). B.] The
“little brown man” has come to stay, and has
already got a big hold on W. A. Unlike the Chow,
he gains to a certain extent the good-will of the
white man by his disinclination to work for less
than white wages ; also, the larrikin begins to
understand that the Jap. is not merely a tail-less
Chow, but a person who, if “ put upon,” will fight
like a bull-terrier.— Washington 8., Geraldton,
W.A., 17th August, 1896.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Temperance Lesson Hook.
El). Bulletin,— Last May you allowed me to
point out the various absurdities in Richards in’s
book on “ Drink.” This aroused a storm of indig-
nation in Napier, and it turned out that in the
schools there they use a different book, namely
Richardson’s “Temperance Lesson Book!” in
the cause of education, permit me to note a few of
the more gross mistakes in this latter :
Page 15. “ Camel carries water in cells or pouches.”
This belief is confined to the ignorant.
Page 28. “ Fat brought into solution by digestion.”
Another exploded idea.
Page 102. “All strong drinks act practically as mix
tures of ethylic alcohol and water.”
This is just what they don’t.
P. 106. “No natural wines contain more than 17 pei
cent, of alcohol.”
P. 119. “ All the members of the alcohol family are got
by fermentation.”
And on p. 1311 the author mentions cetyl alcohol-
got by fermenting a whale !
P. 178. “The frog has a constant temperature o;
70deg.”
How the author came to this goodness knows.
As a matter of fact, the temperature of frogs,
fishes, etc., varies with their environment,
whereas that of mammals and birds does not.
These are taken at random, and no doubt
any physiologist using the book in class
would find more; in fact, I noted worse ones, but
not of a kind that I could expose in so few words.
I maintain that we bring all culture into contempt
by officially teaching this rubbish to children.
And the mere fact of such a book being “ success-
fully ” used in our schools throws, incidentally, a
flood of light on the mental calibre of our teachers.
No one but a “common or garden ” ass could teach
from such a book. Even if he knew no physiology
or chemistry, the interesting points raised would
inevitably lead any rational being to look up the
matter in the accepted text-books. To myself the
most irritating thing in the book is a little
excursus on p. 76, about the word “ rum ” being
derived from saccharuni by “ aphteresis.” Just
fancy if you were to interrupt a brilliant invective
against a gas monopoly by spinning the old yarn
about the etymology of “gas!” That “rum”
does not derive from saccharum is quite a minor
point.

Ed. Bulletin, —Be ants living on ticks.
It’s true ; I saw it several times. Cotton-oil dips
are as likely to stop the tick-plague as I would
going around single-handed with a whitewash-
brush. The system is ridiculous. Coming tlirough
the tick-infested country between Towers and
Croydon, in some places the ground and grass are
swarming with them; so much so that, while
getting your horses in the morning in the long
grass, you will be fairly smothered with them—, o
much so that you have to change your clothes or
go crazy. They don’t fasten on a man, but the
crawling business would drive one balmy. 'lh'
plain-turkeys are dying everywhere from them,
but the dingoes and wild pigs are all fat, from the
dead cattle, &c., so it is an ill-wind that blows no
one good.—D.T.
Australia is the Land of Mysterious Death
Men step out of the great procession, “from tin'
Mother’s Arms to the Dust-shovel,” and vanish
down bypaths with eerie suddenness. Up to a
short time ago a familiar figure on one of the fa;
Northern rivers (relates a Sydney D.T. contribu-
tor) was an old old man who eked out a precarious
and hazardous livelihood by crocodile catching.
His modus was ingenious and full of weird interest.
He would place on the shore, where it sloped ur.-
obstructedly to the water and where the s.turians
were plentiful, a long, shallow box, not unlike an
elongated coffin. One end was open, and the
bait was placed inside at the far end, attached ton
cord. The hungry ’dile, having wriggled in and
seized it, thereby pulled the door down upon him-
self. The old fellow, his prize successfully
“boxed,” would then get into his boat and tow
his freight out to a passing steamer, and have
it hoisted on board, consigned to an agent in Mel-
bourne. This strange cargo found a ready sale,
and the crocodile-trapper realised fairly large
prices. One of his scaly specimens was exhibit! d
at Melb. Aquarium, and has since thriven exceed-
ingly. But a few weeks ago the old man dis-
appeared. A search-party found his boat moon d
to the shore, and his trap (empty) on the beach.
His blankets were spread out near by, and his
coat, rolled pillow-wise, was dented in the middle
as though his head were still in it. But of ti e
owner thereof no trace has since come to light.
Probably a prowling crocodile came upon him
while he slept and dragged him into the water.

William C. Herbert, U. S. N.,-Tabes Ayer’s Sarsaparilla with Him Everywhere. Disordered

V.
Mr. Herbert has been an officer in the U. S. naval service for the past 16 year*.
His duties have taken him all over the world, and he has been on a constant go for
several years, through the Dardanelles, around the famous rock of Gibraltar, in the
Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, about the South Sea Islands, in Hawaii,
round Cape Horn, to South America, Africa—everywhere, almost, under the sun he
has cruised as a navy officer. On his return from one of his voyages the strain told
on him. His blood was in a very bad condition, and his stomach was weakened,
and, as he says, he was “ knocked out.” Mr. Herbert says:
‘ Although I look very hearty now, four years ago my health and physical con-
dition were anything but good. Then it was that I found the constant knocking
about had at last told on me. My blood was very poor and my stomach as bad. I
had been cruising about in the service for a long time without any restand without
ceasing from my duties. Frequent changes in water and climate, such as I experi-
enced, will weaken and debilitate the strongest of us, and I was no exception. In
fact, I was completely run down, and when I came home my family insisted on call-
ing in the doctor. He prescribed for me and did all he could, but nothing came of
it, and I grew worse. As my blood seemed chiefly the cause of the trouble I thought
I would give Ayer’s Sarsaparilla a trial, seeing it advertised to cure such cases. I
took a bottle in*an aimless sort of a fashion, but when I found it helped my stomach
and was commencing to clear my blood, too, I thought there might be some real
merit in it, and accordingly began on a second bottle. Well, to make a long story
short, the third completely cured me and restored me to my old-time health. My
blood was hotter tlnin ever, and my stomach did not bother me in the least. Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla cured me. Now I take it whenever I feel that my system needs it, and
I do not consider myself equipped for a cruise anywhere without a bottle of Ayer’*
Sarsaparilla. It has, I assure you, my hearty indorsement and recommendation.’*

“ My Dear Mr. BONNINGTON.
[copy.]
“Theatre Royal, Sydney, April 20, 1896.
“ Allow me, on behalf of Mrs. Holt, to thank you very sincerely for your
kind thought in sending her, on Saturday, a bottle of your famed Irish Moss. I may say that
it is an old and valued friend of ours, and I am sure our esteem of its virtues will be
strengthened by the acquaintance with it which we now renew, through your good agency.
“ With all sincere wishes for your success and well-being,
“ I remain, yours cordially, BLAND HOLT.”
