“THE BULLETIN" BOOK EXCHANGE.
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal to the price stated (which is
published price with postage added), books in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australasian address.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
MISS MILNE AND I, a story by Dr.
Mannington Caffyn (paper, 2s 6d;
cloth, 3s), has some interest, though the
plot is fantastic and a little foolish. But
many shrewd remarks are intersprinkled,
and the chapters on the Sydney smallpox
scare are very readable and especially
attractive to Australians. Dr. Caffyn
satirises mercilessly the stupidity and
cowardice of Government and people, and
the Quarantine Station at North Head
finds itself infamously famous. The pas-
sage in which Dr. Caffyn sums up his
opinions of Australia is Worth quoting :
I’m at the back of God’s speed, at the tail-end
of His earth, amid a strange people who are
Americans without the American’s “go,’’ and
English without the ballast of the Englishman’s
conservatism ; in a land to which have flocked the
venturesome and the visionary, the restless and
the discontented, the utopian dreamer and the
truant son, ail mixed up in one discordant mass
and .given the franchise.
And so on through three pregnant para-
graphs.
CHILDREN OF CIRCUMSTANCE, by
lota (cloth, 6s. 6d.). Mrs. Caffyn has fallen
into the familiar “ second book” gulf, and
has written in haste in order that readers
may repent at leisure. There is an un-
satisfactory thread of plot, with little of
“ A Yellow Aster’s ” interest ; and the
rest is pains and padding.
THE GREEN CARNATION (paper, 45.;
cloth, 6s. 6d.) is a particularly bright and
clever skit on Oscar Wilde and the creed
of aesthetic decadence or decadent aesthe-
tics. Many of the smart things are quite
as good as Oscar’s own, and give even the
blas6 reader a laugh. The skit, indeed,
misses its aim—if it has an aim—through
being too good ; for the cleverness of the
wearers of the “ green carnation ” is in
such joyous contrast to the respectable
stupidity of the Philistines that one’s sym-
pathies involuntarily go with the naughty
people who are so nice. The audacity with
which the Philistines’ little tin gods (and
some others) are knocked off their
pedestals is also eminently cheering. For
an appreciative soul the book has decidedly
4s. worth of chuckles.
CAMPAIGNS OF CURIOSITY, by Eliza-
beth Banks (boards, 2s. 5d.), is a reprint
of newspaper articles describing the ex-
periences of an American pen woman who
masqueraded as housemaid, laundry-girl,
crossing-sweeper, and so on. Perhaps the
most interesting papers are those which
shocked Park Lane by telling how many
aristocratic dowagers were ready to launch
the new American rich on the sea of
“ society ” —for a consideration. The
book can be read, but loses most of its
attraction out of London.
“ THE ELECTRICIAN ” PRIMERS (vol.
1, theory; vol. 2, practice ; paper, 2s. 3d.
each) are two handy and valuable books
on the subject of electricity—which, like
other scientific subjects, has a great many
“primers ” that are only intelligible to the
expert. These are simple, practical, and
up-to-date.
STUDIES IN PESSIMISM, by Arthur
Schopenhauer (paper, Is. 3d.) This is a
nice little pocket Schopenhauer, which
gives a pleasant taste of the delightfully
cynical philosopher in half-a-dozen selected
fragments : “ The Misery of Life,”
“ Women,” “ Metaphysics of Love,”
“ Genius,” J&thetics of Poetry,” and
“Education.” Every W.C.T.U. library
should own a copy.
International. Science Series.
This series is classic. The subjects are
treated with solidity and thoroughness by
the most eminent writers of the day ; and if
the books lack something on the side of
popularity, there are none more useful to
the student. Compactly cloth bound, 5s 6d
each, unless otherwise stated.

Dear Bulletin, —One of the privileges
accorded the Yio. Institute for the Blind has just
been withdrawn by the Turner Govt. Every year
at Christmas charitable people from different
parts of the province have been in the habit of
affording one or more inmates of the Institute a
holiday on their farms for six weeks or two
months. For the past 20 years it has been the
custom of Govt, to give free passes from Mel-
bourne to any of the blind thus travelling; but
this year the Institute has been served with
notice that the privilege will not be accorded in
future! This, of course, will mean that there will
now be no invitations, as the people affording the
holiday can hardly be expected to pay the train-
fare of their guests from Melbourne and back.
Surely to heaven Victoria has not fallen so low as
to be compelled to resort to .so leprously-mean an
economy ! — Shadow.

Itching Skin Humors
Torturing ; Disfiguring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding, scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of Httle babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and irri-
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
Cuticura Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss of hair.
“How to Cure Diseases of the Skin and Blood,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illus-
trations, 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.
Cuticura Remedies are sold throughout the world. Price, Cuticura, 50c.; Cuticura Soap,

Pimply Skin
red, rough hands, painful finger ends and shapeless nails
are prevented and cured by Cuticura Soap f in-
comparably the greatest of skin purifiers and beautificrs,
while rivalling in delicacy and surpassing in purity the most expensive of toilet and nursery soaps-
The only medicated toilet soap and the only preventive and cure of inflammation and clogging of
the pores, the cause of plmp'-s. blackheads, rough, red, and oily skin and simple humors of infants.

Aphrodite .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On a golden dawn, in the morn sublime
Of years ere the stars had ceased to sing,
Beautiful out of the sea-deeps cold
Aphrodite arose—the Flower of Time —
That, dear till the day of her blossoming,
The old, old Sea had borne in his heart.
Around her worshipping waves did part
Tremulous—glowing in rose and gold.
And the birds broke forth into song most sweet,
And flowers born scentless breathed perfume :
Softly she smiled upon Man forlorn,
And the music of love in his heart did beat,
And down to the pit went his gods of gloom,
And Earth grew bright and fair as a bride,
And folk in star-worlds wondering cried—
“ Lo, in the skies a new star is born !”
O, Beloved, thus on my small world you
Rose flashing it all with rosy flame !
Changing sad thoughts to a singing throng,
And creating the earth and the sky anew !
As Love you appeared—and, 10, you are Fame !
And, all my follies and sins despite,
You yet, Beloved, may see my light—
Small, but a star—midst the stars of song.

Dear Bulletin, —All very fine to laugh
about ghosts, but I believe in them myself, not
that I have ever seen one, but I have felt their
presence for all that. It happened thus : Some
years ago I was in Washington Territory, U.S.A.,
shooting. It was a cold winter and the snow had
driven the elk from the mountains to the valleys
for feed. An old hunter, Hank Richardson,
promised me sport if I accompanied him to a
place called Colseed Bay, near Seabeck. We
started at daybreak one morning, and rowed
over to the Bay, a pull of 12 miles, and
hauled our skiff up on the bank. Then, attended
by a huge dog of Hank’s that was absolutely fear-
less, and would as soon tackle a bear or cougar as
a sheep, We slacked off through the woods on our
quest, intending to return to the skiff before dark,
and reach Seabeck that night. About four in the
afternoon we got our first shot, a fine elk, and, by
the time we had him skinned and the antlers off,
it was too dark to return, and we decided to camp
out for the night. It was bitterly cold and snow-
ing hard, and 1 remarked to my companion
that I wished I was comfortably housed.
“There is a house not a mile from here,”
said Hank, “but it’s haunted, and I wouldn’t
stop there a night for a million dollars.”
And then he told me that a settler, his wife and
family, had been murdered there by Indians 11
years previously, and had haunted the place ever
since; fearful screams were heard at night, and
no one would take up the vacant homestead,
although there were 20 acres of cleared land,
which was open for anyone to claim. I was
younger then and not much given to fear, and
while I could get a roof over my head wasn’t going
to stay out in the snow, and so, finding I could
not budge Hank, started off by myself, going
according to his direction, and I took the dog, at
his earnest request. I found the hut all right—an
ordinary log structure such as the settlers usually
lived in, with a good sound shingle roof, and I
soon had a roaring fire, and was about settling
down for a snooze when the dog startled me with
a fearful howl. I will never forget the appearance
of that dog; with hair erect, tail between his legs,
and eyes starting out of his head, he retreated to
a corner, biting at something I could not see.
Now, I could not see anything but I could feel
someone was in that hut, just as you can feel some-
one creeping up behind you, although you can
hear or see nothing. I was terribly scared and
broke out into a sweat, my knees knocked together,
and my teeth chattered. I could stand it no
longer and rushed for the door, which I had no
sooner opened than, with a blood-curdling howl,
the dog was out before me. Now, tell me this,
even allowing I was a coward, what was the
matter with the dog V Next day neither blows
nor entreaties would get him within a quarter of a
mile of that hut. —Yours, C.E.H.

“The Bulletin’s ” Xmas Sermon.
Christmas is a season with a literature that
is peculiarly its own. It is, in the main, a
bathetic variety of literature—a mild and
sentimental drivel in which the flesh and the
spirit meet and maunder together to no
especial purpose. Nineteen hundred Christ-
mases ago, according to a rather vague and
uncertain chronology, there was born into
this world a great Teacher who told his
generation of a hard and stony road which
led to Paradise. The world has since
utterly departed from that Ancient Way
in fact, only an infinitesimal section of man-
kind ever attempted to follow it, and even
that small fraction promptly abandoned the
attempt, and neither it nor its descendants
made any serious effort to return thereto.
Therefore, rather a ridiculous aspect is
presented to the logical observer by the
religion, or rather the innumerable reli-
gions named after that Teacher of old ;
and the Christmas literature of to-day,
which is largely made up of feeble
attempts to reconcile God and Mammon, is
a sad and washy thing of no especial account.
For the fact is that Christianity is practi-
cally dead and has hardly ever been other-
wise, and while modern civilisation lasts it is
not likely to be resurrected. Moreover, no
one seriously expects that it will be resur-
rected, for it and existing civilisation are
antagonistic elements, and it is necessary to
lot one of them go if the other is to be
retained. In respect to this matter, the
unanimity and promptitude with which the
great mass of mankind has decided which
to let go are little short of marvellous,
• • •
The leading tenets of Christianity, as
set forth in the New Testament, are
the doctrines of contentment and poverty
and non-res'stance, and utter contempt for
the things of this life. It is an austere
and uncompromising faith to which every
element of nineteenth - century exist-
ence is absolutely and irreconcilably op-
posed. A nation whose political course
was guided by the Sermon on the Mount
would become extinct within a year. And
as it is with nations, so it is with individuals.
The person to whom his creed is a reality
can be told—or rather he cannot be told, for
such a person is hardly ever found—prin-
cipally by negative evidences. He is never,
by any chance, a successful trader, for the
successful trader, in these days of hard com-
petition, must live by sweating his underpaid
employes, and driving hard bargains with all
who come in his way. He cannot be a
journalist, for his creed demands absolute
truthfulness and a fearless denunciation of
all evil, and no pressman who con-
ducted his business on such lines would
remain out of gaol for a week. The law is
not open to him, for the legal profession
consists mainly in upholding injustice for
a fee. And most other roads which lead
to success are shut against him for like
reasons. The military profession consists
mostly of shedding blood in an unjust cause.
Finance in all its branches is the art of grind-
ing the faces of the poor ; the financier who
won’t grind the faces of the poor never gets
his money and is a ruined usurer. Land-
lordism consists in stealing that earth which
is the Lord’s, and blackmailing His creatures
for the right to live on its surface. Almost
every trade, through the pressure of intense
competition, has come to depend, directly or
indirectly, on adulteration, sweating, and
fraud in one or other of its many shapes.
Even the spreading of the alleged Gospel
would furnish no means of livelihood if con-
ducted on a gospel basis ; the original creed
of the old Syrian preacher would scare away
all save those who had no worldly goods to
put in the collection-plate, and the taber-
nacle would presently be seized for arrears
of rent. If there is one trade or occupation,
save the very poorest, the worst-paid, and
the most menial, which can be successfully
conducted in a manner which will square
with the New Testament creed, The Bul-
letin, at all events, has never heard of it
and never expects to.
* » •
Modern civilisation would crumble away
if it seriously endeavored to live up to the
New Testament ideal; and if it had attempted
to live up to that ideal in the past it would
never have had an existence. Whether the
world would have been better or worse for
the want of it, or what manner of thing
would have existed in its stead, are problems
that are not relevant to the present subject.
It is even doubtful if Christianity itself
would have spread to any great extent if it
had preserved its ancient purity. It was
disseminated by blood and violence and con-
quest rather than by teaching. It first began
to get a permanent hold on the great mass of
the people when it assumed such a shape that
a brutal autocrat could follow its tenets and
still hang on to his treasures and pomp and
authority and remain the same brutal auto-
crat as he was before. It consolidated
its power when it began to furnish
billets for bloated prelates, and to grind
the faces of the poor in order to build
gorgeous cathedrals with the proceeds.
If the Church had cast out the bloodstained
rnonarchs who were among its chief
buttresses, and had refused to amass riches
by unholy means or to acquire power by
oppression, and had adhered to its own
doctrine of poverty and liberty and human
equality, the world would probably have
preferred the old paganism merely for the
sake of its eternal gorgeousness. If it had
remained true to its ancient doctrine of
peace, then the pure-blooded Bengali—
almost the only man on earth who has never
been known to fight either in a good cause
or a bad one —would have been its only
eligible convert. The alleged Christian
faith conquered chiefly by stooping to the
level of the pagan, and it has remained more
or less at his level ever since.
* * *
The old-time converts did not take their
religion seriously. Neither do the converts
of to-day. The world vaguely comprehends
that the church which can square with
modern civilisation is a sham and a hollow
pretence, and, while it has no very definite
yearning for the faith as it professes to be,
instinctively recognises that the faith as it
is is an anomaly. Therefore, it regards the
preacher with thinly - veiled contempt and
good humored toleration, and views him as
an old-womanish being of no especial ac-
count. It expects nothing of him or of his
creed. It ejects him from the schools as a
person who is unfit -to teach the young in a
serious spirit; and keeps him out of Parlia-
ment as an individual who is mentally in-
capable of running the State ; and prevents
him sitting on juries as a citizen who is
deficient in the logical faculty. It regards it
as a matter of course that the Church in
general should be the bitter opponent of
every reform ; and when it hears of the
conversion of the heathen and learns that
the converted heathen are butchering each
other after the good old fashion of their
pagan forefathers it hardly even expresses
surprise. No one even professes to ex-
pect that the so-called gospel of peace
will bring so much as a shadow of peace any-
where. The Church is everywhere either
openly or secretly opposed to education ; it
opposes education on the ground that its
own influence will thereby be undermined,
and thus acknowledges that it lives on
popular ignorance ; and wherever education
spreads the Church grows feeble, thereby
proving that orthodoxy and illiteracy are, to
a great extent, convertible terms. Yet the
civilised world continues, in an indefinite
sense, to pride itself on its alleged
Christianity, and at the same time it treats
its own faith, and the exponents thereof,
with open contempt. The only explanation
is that it doesn’t take its own religion
seriously, and isn’t sufficiently logical or
sufficiently introspective to know the reason
why.
* * *
There have been periods, however, in the
dark and evil past, when men did take
their religion seriously. They were mostly
times of desolating war waged with a view
to throwing off the clerical yoke, or
else times of miserable submission, when
the Church was loathed in secret,
but the courage for active opposition
was lacking. But in those lands where
priestly domination has ceased to be a
grievous burden and religious persecution is
almost extinct, the Church has taken on a
new aspect. Its most famous and successful
representatives are buffoons of the Talimage,
Beecher, Spurgeon, Moody, and General
Booth description. The prosperous reli-
gionist of the present day bangs a discordant
drum in the temple, and hangs a gaudy
banner on its holy shrines, and garnishes the
solemn mysteries of the ancient creed with
jokes borrowed from the domain of nigger-
minstrelsy. And while this individual is the
most prosperous representative of the modern
church, by a curious anomaly its most re-
spected apostle, and the one who approaches
nearest to the original type, is probably still
the Catholic priest of the better class, who
lives for his illogical faith, and dies leaving
two coppers in the pocket of an old waist-
coat as his sole estate. But the priest is a celi-
bate who stands outside of humanity, and his
survival is only another evidence that modern
civilisation and ancient Christianity are
incompatible. He is as incongruous in this
nineteenth century as a mailed crusader
would be at Chicago, and he is a success
mainly because he is content to remain
incongruous ; if he assimilated himself to
modern conditions the result would be dis-
astrous. The old, dream like, unworldly
faith of Galilee can’t be made to fit in with
the latter-day life of Europe and America and
Australia ; either the old faith has to go, or
the new life must be wholly reconstructed.
So far, it is the old faith that has gone, and
Christianity is practically extinct.
The Toast of “The Queen,”
Editor Bulletin. —When Anthony Ogden,
Labor representative of Townsville in Queens-
land Parliament, refuses to drink Queen Vic-
toria’s health, one naturally expects “ loyal ”
journals to fume, and it does a fellow good to
hear shocked sycophancy howling. But it
comes with a kind of jolt to find a Bulletin
correspondent whining because Ogden declines
to lick the hand of royalty. Does “ W.W. ”
think republican principles are only to be aired
by stealth, under cover of darkness, or when
tender Imperialistic sympathies cannot possibly
be wounded ? Is a democrat to apologise for
democracy, and hide, like the bats, from the
daylight? No, by Bunyip ! Freedom is a wife
for a man to honor in the eye of the sun, not
a mistress to keep out of sight down a back
alley. I thank Ogden for his public flout of
Monarchy, her menace and insulter.
• * *
“ W. W. ’s ” chief grievance seems to be Ogden’s
alleged “ bad taste.” “ Bad taste ” is the hand-
maid of conventionality, and conventionality
is the fetish of little minds. All the more
reason to admire the big ones that will not bow
to Baal. The superfine superfluities of
“superior” people, though canonised by
custom, are chiefly born of neurosis and
anaemia. Stalwart men, who sweat with body
or brain, pish such cobwebs into irreverent
dustbins. Let us rather have Hotspurs than
popinjays in Australia. I say nothing against
“ good taste ” —the oil of intercourse ; for that
has always a logical basis. But I protest
against the idea that feeble fashion can affix
opprobrium to any act without being called on
to stand and deliver reasons. If the reasons
are reasonable, pass Fashion, and all’s well; if
not, let’s strip the jade of her mask, and turn
her over to the “ W.W.’s.”
# # *
Ogden’s offence I glory in, and I deny that it
included a scintilla of “ bad taste.” True, it is
still customary for public men in Australia —
—even for those who are Republicans at heart
—to give formal lip-service to the glasses which
hold the toast of “ The Queen.” Most of those
who think with Ogden have not Ogden’s pluck
—it needs some moral courage to be the one
erect man in a crawling assembly. Others
drink as a matter of form, and quiet their con-
sciences with the thought that the ceremony is
perfunctory, meaningless. But I believe that
Ogden, when the glass is filled which the
“ loyal ” shibboleth dishonours, hears the hiss-
ing of the champagne-bubbles as the hissing of
venomous serpents. When he looks into that
glass he sees, as I do, the grisly spectre
of Monarchy—a spectre of blood and tears.
The past becomes present; he sees file before
him, in interminable procession, the victims of
the crimes of kings and queens—the outraged
women, the murdered men, the starved and
tortured children —sacrifices on the altar of
Monarchy, whose stones are human lives. He
sees the tree of which Queen Victoria is flower
—the villainous Normans, the cruel Plan-
tagenets, the brutal Tudors, the currish Stuarts,
the hoggish Germans—rooted in slaughter,
nourished on lust, thriving by greed; and he
shudders and sets glass. A man does
not drink blood.

“W.W.” finds in “good liquor” an excuse
for obeisance to a democratic lie. Yet he would
not for “good liquor” spit on the grave oi
his father, or suffer a taunt to be flung at the
honor of his mother. Are the graves of Free-
dom’s martyrs to be held less sacred? Is hey
honor to be shamed in silence? Should not
e'Very man who halls himself free be jealous of
the -least blot uponv Freedom’s scutcheon ?
Ogden’s small refusal covers a great principle.
There is a story, perhaps, amocryphal, of an
English sailor taken in the Chinese war, and
ordered to kow-toW before a bedizened man-
darin. He answered, with many oaths, that he
Would kneel to no man, and was forthwith
chopped in pieces. I discern in Ogden’s refusal
to drink Queen V ictori A’s health something of
the same heroic obstinacy, ahdT say it is a good
thing for Australia that such a spirit should be
publicly avowed and encouraged? Climatic or
racial tendencies seem to be weakening here, as
they have weakened in America, the dogged
fibre conspicuous in our ancestors—the grit of
He Montfort, Latimer, Hampden. There is
too much of the ignoble weakness which waives
a principle or submits to an injustice rather
than make a fuss. A lot of us, if not cowards,
too often prefer dishonorable compromise to
honorable danger. D’Artagnan and Porthos
disdained to shout “Down with Mazarin !”
but Dumas makes Mazarin admit that he would
have shouted it himself to save his skin. When
Australia has fighting to do, let us hope
she will not have many citizens of the Mazarin
stamp. I pray, on the contrary, that the
Ogdens may predominate; and I trust the
bracing example of Anthony of that ilk will be
more and more imitated by our public men—
who are especially bound to lead the revolt
against the foolish custom of venerating the
symbols of the curse of Monarchy. For though
Anthony Ogden was disloyal to Queen Vic-
toria, he was loyal to Australia and to
humanity.—Yours, Australian.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Poor Farmer.
The Fat Man party in the Victorian Assembly
wailed once too often about the “ poor farmer”
and his prospective sufferings under the land-
tax, and a truly dreadful thing ensued. For
the party didn’t know that its wail was loaded,
and when it finally pulled the trigger and the
thing went off, the recoil left it sitting down in
a stunned condition and too surprised for
speech. Under Premier Turner’s original
proposal, the agriculturist who possessed land
worth—apart from all improvements and over
and above all mortgages —only <£loo was to go
absolutely free; the man with land to the clear
unimproved value of <£2oo was to pay 6s. Bd.
per annum ; and so on. Therefore, the genuine
“ poor farmer ” would pay little or nothing ;
very often nothing. But, one by one, each big
landholder, who was going to be struck for
,£SOO or so per annum, rose to state that he
didn’t care at all on his own account, but that
he felt it his duty to oppose the measure
because it would ruin the poor farmer, till at
last the Assembly began to believe the hollow
fiction, and became so much moved by the
alleged woes of the alleged agriculturist that it
granted an exemption up to .£SOO. This was a
truly awful blow. The poor farmer is to pay
absolutely nothing, therefore the big landholders
of the Assembly, who objected solely on his
account, have the bottom entirely knocked out
of their objection. The intention was, of
course, to induce the small agricultural crowd
to join the huge monopolists in rejecting the
Bill by pointing out its so-called “ruinous”
character and appealing to their instinct of self-
preservation ; but the monopolists declared so
often that they didn’t object at all on their own
behalf that at last they were taken at their
word. Any party that was one shade less
wooden-headed must have foreseen this inevit-
able result. A decently-intelligent Fat Man
party would have said nothing at all about the
poor farmer, and have done its best to push the
Bill through with no exemptions whatever, and
then it is just possible that the bucolic person
might have felt so bad about his own small
share of the tax that he could be induced to
vote for its repeal at an early date. Now, how-
ever, he has shoved the whole burden on to the
Fat Man at the Fat Man’s own instigation, and
if the Bill only gets through the Council the
poor farmer will find that it is such a pleasant
and convenient way of raising revenue, that he
will presently begin to think of raising more
revenue in the same fashion. The Fat Man
has, quite unconsciously, been sooling his own
dog on himself all this time, and now his feel-
ing are too deep for expression.
Wanted —Australia for the Japs.
Australia’s bogey has changed its mask, and
from Chinese become Japanese. The incidents
of the current war establish definitely and, to
all appearance, finally a conclusion which a few
well-informed people had previously reached,
but which was opposed by almost the whole
vague mass of popular opinion—the conclusion
that the Chinese are not a fighting race, that
they are not united by any spirit of patriotism,
and” that individual apathy and national cor-
ruption make them incapable of any organised
effort for the common benefit. The Chinese
scare is over; but it looks as if soon, with much
more reason, a Japanese scare will succeed it.
For East, North, and West, the Japs are pour-
ing into Australia. At Port Darwin and
Thursday Island they have established a virtual
monopoly of the pearl-fisheries ; at Mackay,
Geraldton, and Townsville many hundreds
have been introduced as labourers on the
sugar-plantation ; and in Westralia, w hile the
men come to fish for pearls, the Japanese
women come by scores to fish for men. The
Jap is patient, intelligent, and adaptable ; and
it is only a matter of time till he gets a per-
manent footing of which it will not be easy to
dispossess him. For the chances are that
Japan—enthusiastic, warlike, and patriotic —
will not submit to be treated by Australia as
contemptuously as China has been. It is quite
conceivable that the rights of a Japanese sub-
ject in Queensland will soon be matter for
international diplomacy, and that we may be
asked to redress grievances at the muzzle of a


rifle, Everything goes to show that Australia
has only two alternatives —free welcome or
complete exclusion. The former is unthink-
able by any democrat. With all his virtues,
the Jap is a cheap laborer of the most un-
Eleasant kind; his race-quality does not fit
im for intermarriage on equal terms with
Caucasian peoples; and his presence in large
numbers will unquestionably degrade the stan-
dard of Australian civilisation. The fact that
in many vital points of character he is equal, or
almost equal, to ourselves, makes his rivalry all
the more dangerous. Yet Great Britain, true
to the worship of the golden calf, has just con-
cluded with Japan a treaty which throws open
Japanese markets to her trajle, and in return
concedes to Japanese subjects the right of entry
and settlement on British soil. It is provided
that any of the Australian provinces may be
made parties to the treaty if they express a
desire to that effect at any time within the next
two years ; and already the journalistic organs
of commercial opportunism are pointing out the
great benefit which would result to Australia
from extensive meat and wool export to
Japan. It is a benefit which should be refused
without the slightest hesitation. Trade is too
dearly bought by the ruin of national life. Men
are worth more than money. Australia will
never sell her birthright for a mess of pottage.
The Central Division.
The difficulty between the two Houses of the
N.S.W. Legislature concerning the throwing
open to selection of the Central Division, raises
once more the old question—what is the real
necessity for throwing open the Central Divi-
sion at all ? According to the Bill as passed by
the Assembly, the Government is to be author-
ised to resume one-half of any, or every, pas-
toral lease, the squatter being compensated for
the loss. The compensation, in its various alter-
native shapes, would probably amount in the
end to a very serious responsibility, but this is
not the question immediately at issue. The
Council took hold of the measure and
amended it to read that land-resumptions are
to be made only at the option of the pastoralist,
under which system the pastoralist will natur-
ally offer to surrender to the State only the
useless, barren and inaccessible parts of his run,
and need not surrender any part at all,
and the opening up of the Central Division, so
far as the purposes of agriculture are concerned,
will be as remote as ever. The case on one
side is that it is urgently necessary to find more
room for agricultural expansion ; on the other,
it is urged that the proposed change, if it
answers the purposes for which it is intended,
is likely to seriously diminish the output of
wool, and the wool export is still the principal
support of New South Wales. There is much
solid logic in this latter contention. In The
Bulletin’s opinion, it is not the Central but
the Eastern Division of the province which
most wants to be thrown open. There is still
enough good land lying unused within a rea-
sonable distance of the sea-board to supply all
the demands of the agricultural community for
at least a few years to come. It is held by
large landholders and syndicates, either for the
purpose of exacting exorbitant rents, or else
to sell at a rise when its value has been
enhanced by other men’s labors and by the
increase of settlement. Its owners produce
nothing, and add nothing to the public wealth,
while the squatter, despite his offensive arro-
gance and all his other bad qualities, is still, in
a sense, a producer and a person of some value
to the community. Moreover, at the present
time the large markets for agricultural produce
are all on or near the eastern coast ; prices are
woefully low ; and railway freights, even if
reduced to the minimum, render it almost
impossible for the agriculturist who is situ-
ated far inland to make anything like a
reasonable subsistence. Under these conditions,
the opening up, on a large scale, of the Cen-
tral Division to a race of small farmers is
very like offering a stone instead of bread.
If the Reid Government will draft a measure
which will have the effect of breaking up the
big estates in the Eastern Division and forcing
them into the market on moderate terms, it
could then afford to leave the hopeless and
desolate Central districts alone until the
beginning of next century. The difficulty with
the Upper House would probably be just about
as great in one case as in the other, but the
results to the community at large would be
widely different. This argument, by the way,
is addressed, not to the Council but to the
people. At present the people have decided
that they want the Central district thrown
open, and it should be th own oieu ac< rd-
ingly.
Proputty’s Effrontery.
The mischievous imitation of the English con-
stitution with which New South Wales started
self-government continues to make itself dis-
liked. The Bulletin devoutly hopes that it
will be more and more disliked until a people
weary of the shibboleths of its great-great-
grandfathers rises in disgust to sweep them
away altogether. The trouble now, as usual, is
with that part of the imitation called the
Legislative Council. In any reasonable scheme
of representative government, the Legislative
Council, as now constituted, could not possibly
find a place, for it represents nothing whatever
but the whim, or the friendship, or the policy,
or the financial necessity, of a Minister
who by chance got the power to make
his brother Bill one of the permanent
rulers of New South Wales. Were it not for
custom, the spectacle of three dozen doddering
old gentlemen—some of whom ought to be in
an asylum, some in gaol, and some in bed—
sitting like a wart on the nose of representative
institutions, would at once be closed by a con-
scientious management. Even when it does
nothing the Legislative Council is ridiculous.
When it does something it is atrocious.
And it now presumes to arrogate equal
powers with the Legislative Assembly,
elected by the people on a manhood suf-
frage basis ; and to flout the decision of
the majority of a just-elected Parliament.
The Assembly’s resolution empowering the
Government to resume half the squatter’s leases
in the central division of the province, when
made necessary by the progress of settlement
and on payment of compensation, was generally
regarded as a compromise highly favorable to
the squatters. There is no need of argument
to prove that. But the Legislative Council,
composed largely of squatters, decides that
where “ our runs ” are concerned— i.e. , the land
leased from Government at a nominal rent and
monopolised as sheepwalks—the popular will
counts for nothing. Thus when, after many
weary years of effort, New South Wales at last
succeeds in amending her land laws so as to
give the small settler a new chance to justify
the hopes which are entertained of him ; when
an Assembly of people’s representatives, fresh
from an appeal to the country, emphatically
voices the popular will; a Council of irfbsponsible
nonentities cheerfully waves people and Parlia-
ment aside, and decides that its private
interests are to be the law of the land. The
occasion is an excellent one to settle for all
time the hash of the Legislative Council.
Were a score of sturdy boilermakers and car-
penters made Councillors in Maoriland fashion,
pending constitutional amendment, the idea
that the Government and people of New South
Wales were created to make “ our runs ” profit-
able would disappear finally. The Bulletin
regrets that Premier Reid is not the man to
do it.
The Logic of Landlordism.
Discussing the rights of the landlord class in
Yic. Parliament the other night, Trenwith
pertinently asked ; “ Supposing Victoria was
owned by one land monopolist, and he ordered
all the rest of the population off his property,
would they go?” “They would,” ejaculated
capitalist Harper—-Victoria’s political blind
Harper—“ if he had a good army to defend his
right.” Trenwith, however, missed the real
point at issue, which is : “ Supposing Victoria
was owned entirely by one big monopolist, and
he ordered all the rest of the people off his pro-
perty, should they go ?” The law, and the Fat
Man’s political economy, and the Tory creed in
general, and the whole doctrine of private land-
lordism say in a loud voice that they should.
All the axioms of that political faith whose
creed is summed up in the words, “ Keep off
the Grass,” declare that they should go at once
and without question. And Harper, vrho
speaks of the landlord defending his “ right,”
also says so—he claims that the wholesale and
retail ejection of everybody is not an unjust
privilege, but a right concerning which there is
no dispute. If the landlord in question owned,
not Victoria merely, but the wdiole solid earth,
and he gave the entire human race legal notice
to get off his property, it would be the duty of
the human race, according to Harper’s logic, to
wade into the sea at once and come back no
more. And if the landlord owned the sea also,
then it would be their duty, under the like
circumstances, to disembark into the upper
atmosphere and go into space. The complete
and wonderful beauty of landlordism can only
be fully appreciated when it is thus worked out
to its logical conclusion. The aggregate land-
lord, it is true, in consideration of a certain
amount of blackmail, has so far consented to
refrain from exercising his legal right to eject
the rest of the human race out of the globe, but
his purchased forbearance makes no difference
in the moral aspect of the case. The circum-
stance remains that he has the legal right. And
the fact that the aggregate landowner should
be authorised to order the rest of the human
race to clear off the earth at his pleasure is
quite as unjust and anomalous as was, in times
past, the fact that he had the right to hang
them at his pleasure while they were on it.
The New South Wales Postmaster-General will
probably end by landing his Government in a
few very expensive lawsuits, when some out-
raged business-man, whose legitimate occupa-
tions have been injured by the non-delivery of
letters, arrested under the gratuitous suspicion
that they contained fees for racing and gamb-
ling-sweeps, resorts to legal proceedings.
Though the Postmaster-General claims to con-
tract himself out of all liability for failure to
deliver letters posted according to the regula-
tions, there are limits even to his authority.
It is held by some that the Postmaster-General
does not come within the legal definition of a
“ common carrier,” and, whatever may be the
legal valueof that contention, if judgment is to be
made upon Joseph Cook individually, it would
seem that he, at any rate, is a most uncommon
carrier. Business firms dealing with suspected
turf-gamblers have had their invoices consigned
to the Dead-letter Office ; an Agricultural
Society complains respecting the diversion of
its business correspondence ; and the long-
haired and meek-faced charity-monger has had
his begging epistles seized because they were
addressed to certain prohibited individuals.
Some day or other some indignant citizen will
proceed to obtain a legal decision as to the right
of Cook, M.L.A., to make foolish mistakes
about his correspondence, and arrest it on the
assumption that it is something which it is not,
and then serious trouble will ensue.
Duncan Gillies stands an even-money chance
of losing his billet as Vic. Agent-General. He
was sent to London by the very man (Patter-
son) who had previously declared that nobody
new was needed at the A.G.’s office as long as
Andrew Clarke was willing to fill the chair
for a modest salary of £2OO over and above his
pension. On Patterson’s own showing the
appointment of Gillies at £2500 per annum
was a sinful job, from the purely financial point
of view. Also, it is generally admitted that
Gillies ought to be recalled immediately, for
the excellent reason that he is Gillies. His
personal claims to be abolished by Act of Par-
liament are beyond question. The Agent-
General billet may continue to exist in an
amended form, but the idea of a busted com-
munity paying £2300 a year extra to keep up the
( Allies fiction is altogether revolting. Gillies
must be fetched back to perish in obscurity.
The decision of the S.A. Labor-party to sup-
port only candidates who are eligible for
admission to a trades union shuts out Premier
Kingston, who is the mainstay of the Demo-
cratic cause in Parliament. At next election
the Labor-party has, by this decision, pledged
itself to oppose Kingston because he isn’t a
tailor or a cooper, and to do its best to throw
him out. If he is thrown out there is no man
at present in sight who can fill his place. If he
gets in, despite all opposition, he will probably
come back with his Democratic aspirations con-
siderably cooled, if not entirely extinguished,
by his party’s ingratitude. Yet the same crowd
which thus deliberately abjures Kingston follows
him in the Assembly on all important questions ;
and if it fails to throw him out at next election,
it will come back and follow him some more.
And if, when it comes back to follow him, after
its unsuccessful effort to eject him altogether,
he refuses to lead, it will probably call him
“renegade” and other words to the same
effect. The S.A. Labor men are doubtless
going to work the right way if their ambition is
to form a Labor-party which will represent
tailors and shoemakers only ; if they want to
create a national Democratic party which will
represent the country at large their proceedings
are suicidal.
What right had Griffith, 0.J., when John
Willard, ex-M.P. for the Tweed (N.S.W.),
was acquitted of the charge of larceny brought
against him by Q. Postmaster-General, to tell
a person w'hom the jury declared innocent that
“ he might consider himself very fortunate
indeed ? ” When a man has been tried and
acquitted, the Judge wdio abuses his power to
blacken the accused’s character degrades the
ideal of justice and proves his unfitness to be
Judge. The situation is not improved by the
fact that Willard, as a political partisan, is
bitterly hated by the ex-Premier’s faction.
Supposing Griffith had been impeached for a
breach of public trust for his share in the
notorious Robb case, when, as Premier and
Attorney-General, he consented to his fees as
advocate being fixed at the highest figures
ever known in Queensland, and drew £2778
from the Treasury while receiving .£I3OO
a year as Ministerial salary, would he not have
protested if, when found not guilty by a jury,
the Judge had told him he might consider him-
self fortunate to get off? Mr. Willard’s
alleged offence was the taking of some receipts
for registered letters from the postal depart-
ment. The jury found that he did not take
them ; the Judge went out of his way to prac-
tically say that he did. If a Judge is allowed
to so misconduct himself, what is the use of a
j ur y ?
Shearing is over in Australia for another year,
and with it its annual concomitant—the strike.
Speaking generally, the Pastoralists’ Unions
have been victorious in all the provinces except-
ing New South Wales, and there, despite all
denials, they have had the worst of the contest.
In Victoria 13s. per 100 was the ruling rate; in
Queensland, 15s. ; but in New South Wales the
standard rate of 20s. was pretty well main-
tained, though a few sheds paid only 17s.
However, the pastoralists, though nominally
the victors, have come off badly on the whole.
They are beginning to realise that the few
miserable pounds that they save on the shearing
rate do not compensate for spoiled fleeces and
ruined sheep, and nights of sleepless anxiety
concerning fires; not to speak of the cost of
landing the gentle blackleg safely on the
ground, and of guarding him when he is there.
In a word, the P.U. is slowly coming to the
conclusion that the amateur blackleg doesn’t
pay. Unluckily, the pastoralists, like most
other people, have short memories. The con-
clusion they have just arrived at is the same
one which they reached and forgot again on
previous occasions, so next year the same old
conflict, with the same old repentance to follow,
will probably begin all over again.

Two returned Rue Australians called in at The
Bulletin office last week to curse unre-
servedly, yet more in sorrow than in anger,
Don W. Lane and all his works. They were
a sturdy pair of Queenslanders, without a cent,
in their combined pockets, and they told
pathetically how they had sold their horses and
their houses and their allotments of land,
and placed their all in Don Lane’s hands, and
how that remarkable dreamer had apparently
gone and blewed it beyond the hope of
redemption. Then they went on to explain
how, when they saw Lane riding about with
revolvers in his belt to superintend the evic-
tion of the natives from their poor little
houses and orange groves, their blood and bile
rose together, and they swore that they would
have no share in such proceedings. So
they “ conveyed ” a settlement boat under the
nose of Alf. Walker, and with two mates
started on a river voyage of 1300 miles, over
snags and rapids, through mud and mangroves,
where the cordial and sociable alligators
clustered so thickly that they had to take
refuge at night in the trees to escape them.
By-and-by they got to the coast and worked
their passage to Australia in different vessels,
meeting in front of Sydney Post-office to hear
that Australia is covered with wrecked
families who have sold up their homes to go to
Paraguay and can’t get a passage from the
bowelless Association, which has 13 balance-
sheets to show instead of cash. And now they
are starting the world again, mighty thankful
to get hack to Australia, and vowing that many
a time they have had reason to remember The
Bulletin’s words that “it'was easier to get to
Paraguay than to get back.” From all which
it appears that Don Lane, in his wild
endeavours to abolish human misery, has only
succeeded so far in making a very substantial
contribution to the size of the original heap.
Melbourne Divorce Court does its business in
a most erratic fashion nowadays. It has bursts
of what looks like altogether unaccountable
suspicion, and when it is in one of these moods
it requires a most surprising amount of evidence
before it will grant a separation even in the
simplest kind of undefended case. Sometimes
half-a-dozen apparently reliable witnesses will
appear to corroborate petitioner’s statement,
and, though there is no testimony whatever on
the other side, the case will be dismissed because
of “ insufficient proof.” And now as to the
genesis of these spasms. There has arisen in
Melbourne a class of solicitors who take divorce-
cases by contract. They undertake, after re-
viewing the evidence, to procure a separation
for a certain fixed sum, and naturally the
lower the expenses can be kept the more profit
there is for the contractor. Therefore, he
cuts the barrister’s fee down to the utmost,
calls only such witnesses as are absolutely
necessary, and does everything on a scale of
squalid economy which is an insult to the lavish
traditions of the law. In other words, he acts
like a man who is dispensing his own money
instead of his client’s. The common impression
is that the Court has “ dropped ” to this un-
professional conduct, and is sitting hard down
upon it. When the court dismisses the case for
want of evidence, the contractor, who is paid
by results only, loses his fee; and when it
makes the wretched man call twice as many
witnesses as he intended to do, it swells the
expenses to such an extent that the transaction
is a dead loss. These violent fits and starts
lend so much uncertainty to the business that
this feeble attempt at providing cheap law in
the divorce branch of the business will probably
soon be abandoned. Cheap law is a thing that
has to be Put Down.
♦
Wealthy Walter Synnot, of Geelong, has
expended a small fortune in an utterly hopeless
attempt to divorce his lawful wife. They were
married 20 years ago. Three years later the
lady, who,. on her husband’s ex-parte show-
ing which, of course, has to be taken
for exactly what it is worth, was
“ sour, disappointed, and cold,” chilled him
into proposing a deed of separation, which bond
of disunion she has icily adhered to ever since.
There is plenty of evidence that Mr. Synnot
did his best to obtain a renewal of the
original marriage contract, and was desirous
of a reconciliation. Mrs. Synnot, however,
rejected all overtures, and went to England.
Many inducements to return were offered her,
but the lady stood fast by her separation deed,
and simply smiled a refrigerating smile from
afar off. Mr, Synnot had no legal leg to stand
upon in applying for a divorce on the ground
of desertion. The virtuous wife is merely
fulfilling her share of the contract, and
that “law of God,” which the Church makes
so much noise about in matters relating to
marriage and divorce, has nothing to do with
the case. Mrs. Synnot’s defence in this action,
apart from the unanswerable parchment, was a
cynical sneer at the Church theory that mar-
riage w as ordained in the best interests of man’s
natural instincts. The lady charged her hus-
band with having committed improprieties
since he lost her society, 17 years ago. The
legal merits’of this extra defence didn’t come
on for serious discussion, inasmuch as the deed
of separation put petitioner right out of court;
but probably Mr. Synnot’s “improprieties”
(admitted) would have settled his chance, any-
w'ay. Between the law of nature, the law of
divorce, and the law of God, which seem to be
ordering him three different ways at once, Mr.
Synnot fares badly. It is the religious aspect
of his case which chiefly interests The Bul-
letin. Granting that Mr. Synnot was for a
long time anxious to resume cohabitation with
the lady to whom God has joined him, is he
now entitled to a special “impropriety”
license? If so, where can he get it? And who
will license the necessary woman?
__
A firm of Melbourne solicitors has called upon
Premier Turner to reconsider the awful ques-
tion of taxing British mortgagees wdio have so
kindly “ lent large sums of money to persons in
the Australasian colonies on the security of
land.” The firm of solicitors is not prepared
to say that a tax on these foreign philanthro-
pists is illegal, notwithstanding the moral
wdckedness of it. As a matter of duty to the
country, however, the firm ventures to submit
an idea of what might happen if the “rights ”
of the alien usurer were encroached upon. The
firm reminds Turner that it is above all things
necessary to avoid frightening “ British capi-
talists,” lost, when the Victorian Government
wants to raise another loan, they might suspect
it of an intention to tax the interest, “ a
suspicion that would inevitably have the
effect of making them ask, as a premium
against possible risks, a higher rate of interest
than they would otherwise have been willing to
accept.” With ghastly nonsense such as this
Fatman (and his firm of solicitors) fights the
inevitable. Comment on the tone of the letter,
and its reference to our British benefactors’
“ willingness to accept ” interest from Aus-
tralia, is not necessary. The most objection-
able feature of the epistle is its solemn
stupidity. Victoria never undertook not to
have a land-tax which, in the natural order of
legislation, would affect mortgagees. TheTuRNER
Government is entitled to put a tax on land mort-
gagees even as the Rosebery Government may
add a penny to the British income-tax without
troubling to consider whether there is any Aus-
tralian money invested in the British stocks,
&c., that help to produce the income. A ques-
tion of “ good faith ” doesn’t arise in the
matter. As regards loans, the payment of
interest, free from any sort of taxation what-
soever, wmuld be guaranteed by the Victorian
Government if the British capitalists felt at all
nervous, and the bogus “ possible risk ” hereto-
fore mentioned would vanish. Meanwhile, the
capitalist shows no signs of nervousness.
Premier Nelson (Q.) owed the recent
majority of one (!)—that saved his Government
after a first defeat on Jack Hamilton’s motion of
censure —to the absence from the division of Duffy,
M.P., for Bundaberg, and O’Connell, member for
Musgrave. These electorates have been, of recent
years, the pocket-property of MTI wraith. O’Con-
nell is an unsettled sort of person, but Mike Duffy,
the ex-ferry boatman, was commonly regarded as
a solid democrat. The man who has invested his
savings in land until he becomes a magnate, can
generally be relied upon, however, to stay away
from a division which threatens discomfort to his
brother Fat Man. Duffy’s explanation is that he
rushed out of the Chamber to find O’Connell, and
was just returning with his captive to vote against
the Government, when the Sergeant-at Arms
slammed down the bar in front of him.

My Dear Moorabinda —

wickian sense) for the polite future of the race.
Bub anybody who has travelled in the same
public conveyance with a High School girl scarcely
raises an eyebrow at this horseplay carried on
under the eye of the Premier and the prophet of
public instruction, who ought to seem like little
pasteboard deities to State schoolgirls, one would
think. The abnormal aplomb of these frizzy pil-
grims to the shrine of State learning is an old
storv—and no wonder. You can’t cast your 14-
vear-old daughter on to the “business” trams
morning after morning and expect her to return to
you after many days as diffident as when she
started ! Education by tram is nob what the pre-
cocious Australian girl stands most in need of,
but it is lust what a certain section of her has been
getting for a long time now, and the effect of it is
beginning to tell.
Talking about breaks up (and the air just now
isfull of “The boy who stood on the burning
deck” and “Home, Sweet Home,” with varia-
tions). Sir Robert and Lady Duff took a special
flight from Moss Vale the other day solely in the
Hielan’ interest ye ken. While his Excellency
aired his fresh-caught and blameless eloquence at
a Soots’ College, her Excellency (by the way, they
wrote her down Lady Duffy in a southern news-
paper-but between Duff and Duffy what a great
national gulf is fixed !) was doling out the rewards
of merit at another Scottish haunt of learning,
The Guvmentonseites seem on thorns to make
amends for the faux-pas of last year, but it looks
as if they were going to overdo it. After all, New
South Wales isn’t entirely peopled by Scotchmen.
The immaculate heroine of a recent southern
society divorce-case, who posed as the badly-per-
secuted spotless plaintiff, made rather a bad
beginning of her resurrected single life. She
made the mistake of putting up at a strictly
fashionable, but rather lively pub., and of enter-
taining a couple of johnnies unawares. The chil-
dren were so fond of Mr. Blank, you know, and
there really was no harm if he gave the youngest
a little gold bangle and took the whole party on
an ice-cream hunt round town —and all this airy
gallivanting while the newspapers were still pal-
pitating with details of her domestic infelicity.
However, on the very eve of a theatre-party
arranged by the lady, the johnnies backed out of
the little picnic, with many polite excuses, and
saved her reputation in spite of herself. By way of
showing the hideous ingratitude of a woman
baulked in the act of a scatter-brained little spree,
she now cuts both of her social preservers as dead
as door-nails.
How is it, I wonder, that the numerous and
occasionally reliable books on “Modern Etiquette”
don’t contain up-to-date hints for well-meaning,
but careless divorcees? The great female army
(for it is only women who are seriously affected by
divorce —your unchained Benedict is as good as
new after it’s all over) which now marches
under the banner of the rule nisi certainly
want just as much social piloting as the
hordes who are getting engaged and mar-
ried with full printed directions and diagrams
to enable them to go through the mill in style.
Yet, so far, there isn’t a word of advice to the
divorced. If ever I write a book on Manners and
Tone, I will include a special chapter on the sub-
ject, in which I will advise the twice-laid spinster
to avoid V-shaped bodices, dress circles, loud con-
versation, champagne, young men and big thumb
rings as piously as she would a shower-bath of
freckles, or else the world will forget who was the
plaintiff, and get horribly mixed up over the ins
and outs. No really fashionable book of social
hanky-panky can now be regarded as complete
without special reference to the deportment of
the divorced. It might begin with a genteel
reference to the Empress Josephine, and east
quite a society glamour over the distressing
business.
Talking about divorce reminds me that a recent
Sydney marriage was a demonstration of the old
gag—“ Everything comes to him who waits.”
For the bride had been loved by the bridegroom
in the romantic and misty past, when she was a
blushing thing of 20, and the world seemed to her
peopled with long, tawny-raoustaohed heroes over
6ft. high, with dreamy violet eyes and tan boots,
all on the jump to strew her path with diamonds.
At that unpromising period the bridegroom pro-
posed and got a scornful refusal from the young
lady who was waiting for the duke. Fourteen
years afterwards, however, he once more came
smiling up to the same old scratch, proposed, and
was gratefully accepted ! In that anxious interim
the heroes had dwindled down to ordinary citizens
of five-feet odd, carrying little black luncheon-
bags, and living on air so as to save up enough to
buy a bicycle, and when Romeo re-appeared (a
little fatter than before), just as the situation was
becoming desperate, he had an odds-on chance.
It all reminds me of a picture I saw somewhere
recording the fact that at eighteen a girl asks
“Who is he?” at twenty-eight “What is he?”
but at forty “ Where is he?”
By the way, a harrowing scene occurred in a
Southern church, the other day, just before a wed-
ding. It was a scene which leaves the Inquisi-
tion nowhere for refinement of cruelty. The
verger was hanging about the steps waiting to
play bell-wether to the wedding-party, when the
bridegroom, unsupported and petrified with fear,
turned up and shied about the entrance uncertain
how to proceed. “What d’yer want,” grunted
the “virgin.” “ I—l am the man,” gurgled the
unhappy creature in lavender pants; but that
simple statement was too vague for his tormentor.
“What man? Best man?” said he. “N —no,”
stammered the hero of the hour, “ I’m going to be
married. Has She come yet?” But these in-
definite third personal pronouns were too vague for
the verger. “Has who come yet?” he said testily.
“Oh, the girl I’m going to marry,” wailed the
victim in desperation—but just then the hired
white steeds were observed in a cloud of dust,
and the situation somehow righted itself.
Sydney’s brand-new Mayor is a quiet and un-
aggressive individual, a printer on a large scale,
with a delicate laissez-faire kind of Mayoress, and
a grown-up daughter who will probably do most
of the pump-handle business at mob receptions.
But it is not anticipated that the citizens will be
worried with very many invitations to the Town
Hall while Mayor Lees is on top, especially with
so much talk going the rounds re the curtail-
ment of the civic salary. Talking about Mayors,
how differently different people regard them.
“What do you think of the new Mayor?” said
one lady to another at the cricket-match. “Well,
we’ll see how she’ll do,’’ was the very Welsh-
sounding reply.
Over Mayor Manning’s retirement I drop croco-
dile tears. He was the jauntiest civic potentate I
have ever seen in the robes picked out with
rabbit skins—his language hardly ever deserved
the epithet of Town Hall English, and his legs
would carry a penny novelette to a flourishing
conclusion. ” Though he was not a butterfly poten-
tate, like one of his predecessors who endeavoured
to float to a title on a high tide of villainous fizz,
Mayor Manning’s “handle” got home just the
same. It arrived there, too, spite of the fact that
his term of office was one of the least festive ever
known in civic annals. But, then, so much depends
for that sort of thing on being backed up by a
sassiety-souled Mayoress.
What a crowd of “delicate” women there are
among the wives of public men. I understand
that a very high political personage in Australia
is simply wild to run a political salon, but his
pretty wife is never out of the doctor’s clutches,
and he might just as well be an unhooked bachelor
for all the social help he gets from his mate. But
politicians seem to have bad luck in matrimony.
Very few of them secure Primrose dames, ready
to rush out and embrace a vegetable Chinaman in
order to secure his vote for the old man—far from
it! Indeed, when a politician pushes his fortunes
to the top of the tree, Mrs. P. generally sits at
the root admiring his fine feathers, without the
faintest idea of assisting him to retain his bad
eminence. Just think of Australian public men—
aren’t they nearly all grass-widowers in the eyes
of society ? Where is the Cabinet Minister
possessed of a wife who is a smart talker, a grace-
ful hostess, or a successful social intriguante, such
as we folks down under are told exist in bushels up
above ?
There is no deception about the interest Aus-
tralians take in cricket. There was almost a
Melbourne Cup multitude at the Sydney Cricket
Ground last Saturday, the first heat of the test
matches, to see whether All-England could hit a
leather ball harder than All-Australia. I thought
the scores looked as if the Kangaroo (going the
entire animal) would give the British Lion toko,
though really I don’t understand the game a bit.
What most interested me about the field was the
extreme difficulty one-.experienced in separating
the sheep from the goats—l mean the “ gentle-
men ” from the professionals —of the visiting team;
they all looked so alike in the open ! No wonder
the team put up at different hotels—they would
never sort themselves to the public satisfaction if
they didn’t. And other objects that amused me
were the exiled Englishwomen, fat and in full
bloom as well as young and slender, sporting the
blood-shot colors of the Briton in hatbands and
neckties. But the patriotic display was quite
superfluous, considering that one always spots a
she-Englishwoman by the noble size of her feet,
and not by the flag in her hat. By the way, 1
didn’t see one society woman or girl sporting the
Australian colors. I suppose it was because some
of the “gentlemen” are so rich and so single,
Sassiety, which always has one longing eye on
Piccadilly, cannot run the risk of jeopardising a
life’s chance for the sake of an Australian blue
hatband !
I suppose there was the usual percentage of
decent dressing on view, but the first person I
jolted against in the Members’ was the wife of a
society publican in blue muslin (I mean the wife,
not mine host), salted with yellow roses, like wall-
paper at a penny per yard ; and the spectacle
warped my judgment for the whole afternoon.
There was a damsel there in a choppy blouse and
skirt of pen-and-ink checks, with spasmodic
appearances of white insertion, which would have
made a good bathing-suit—a garment it cruelly
resembled. Another lady wore rose-pink, with
green sprouts upon her shoulders, and she looked
like the girl (even now upon us) who comes
on and tries to convince you that she’s
a pink rose with a green calyx in the
pantomime. Hilda Sponge, in spook-white
silk, was artistically impressive ; backed up by
Fairy Godmother Essie Jenyns Wood (who, I
hear, is writing a novel). A married lady in pink
had her ear tickled all the afternoon by the en-
croaching tawny moustache of her “Plutonic”
friend. The last time I saw that moustache it
was outlined against a glass door in a most
romantic conjunction.
The Sydney Cricket-ground management broke
out on Saturday into “ rules ” for ladies warning
them in darkling legal language not to sit in the
gangway, and not to open their umbrellas even if
they fried as they sat. Considering that the
members’ stand is only an improved sort of cab-
men’s shelter, and that the women spread out in
interpolated cane chairs half-way over the gravel,
the umbrella ukase is rather severe on girls with
noses addicted to freckling. But woman is a
meek and law-abiding biped, and not one gamp
was elevated, although people beyond the roof-
shade looked like hot toast.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

“Jones,” the third and last production of
the comedy season at Sydney Lyceum, was dis-
tinguished by the fact that there was less of it
than any of its predecessors. It was also distin-
guished by the fact that it was a shade worse than
the "Foundling,” and immeasurably inferior to
the "New Boy.” Apart from these two circum-
stances, it wasn’t distinguished in any way what-
soever. On the opening night it lasted just an
hour and three-quarters, and much of that was
interval, and very cheerful and comforting interval
too. Apart from its brevity, the most original
feature about “Jones ” was the absolute want of
all feminine interest. There were only two ladies
in it, and they had little to do and nothing of any
importance to say. A good deal was said about a
third lady, who seemed as if she would have been
interesting if she had appeared, but she didn’t
turn up. The result proved that a comedy can’t
be built out of male characters only, especially
when most of them are dull and stupid and dis-
mally commonplace. “Jones’’turned upon a small,
ugly, reddish individual, who, for certain reasons
connected with a lady, visited a small and stupid
village in disguise, and, when his business was
completed, threw his disguise into the river and
reappeared in his real character. The stupidest
policeman on earth then found the disguises in the
river, and arrested him for the murder of himself,
and, not being able to produce himself, he was
naturally put in gaol, and talked to death by the
Mayor. When he recovered his disguise, and
resumed his first character, and proved that he
was still alive, his disappearance in his second
capacity couldn’t bp explained, and the authorities
— whose name was Elijah Porkington—demanded
that the matter should be cleared up by both of
him appearing together. Something good might
I e made out of this idea, but the author merely
states the circumstances after the solemn fashion
of a sheep catalogue, and under these conditions
there remained only the bare fact that the hero
was sometimes a small, reddish man with whiskers,
and sometimes a small, brownish man without
whiskers. The company maintained something
very like a dead level throughout, except that
Messrs. Hawthorne and Ralph Roberts rose
above the prevailing mediocrity whenever the
solemn mystery of “Jones” made such a thing
possible.
** * *
“ Cinderella,” with a very strong com-
pany, some more living pictures, and a myriad of
legs, commences at the Lyceum on Saturday.
Mr, Rignold revived the fine old comedy
of “Confusion ” at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), to fill
in the last week before the upheaval of the panto-
mime. Her Majesty’s company, on the rare
occasion when it drops into comedy, generally
drops into this particular comedy, and does it so
well that many people are inclined to wonder why
it doesn’t depart more frequently from the gory
paths of melodrama, and try something of a lighter
character. Even the story of the large, hulking,
but noble son who is unjustly suspected of making
away with the old man, and whose vast estates
are “shook” by a wicked relative acting under a
forged will, begins to pall after a time, despite its
many excellencies. “ Confusion ” will be suc-
ceeded on Saturday by “The House that Jack
Built,” a pantomime which sounds a good deal
less hackneyed than the average, Avery big
company has been laid on for the occasion, and all
the glory and miscellaneous effect which the stage
will hold are to be supplied with a lavish hand.

The ever-welcome Bland Holt has arrived
in Sydney and deposited his luggage at the Royal,
where he opens on Boxing Night, with the “Span
of Life.” The co. includes Walter Baker, Mrs.
Holt, Misses Hilda Spong, Virginia Vivienne,
and several dozen others. Meanwhile, the tearful
tale of the “Streets of London ” is dragging the
slow wail of its bitter anguish to a conclusion, and
the heroine will presently totter over the pave-
ment in search of a crust for the last time.
** * *
Charles Arnold’s co. opens another short
season of “ Charley’s Aunt ” at Sydney Criterion
on Boxing Night, with Mr. Seagar, in lieu of
Frank Thornton, as the lady from Brazil. The
Kinetoscope show, at 148 Pitt-street, has been
enlarged and added to, and is more than ever
worthy of inspection. A flying-machine is either
to fly or fall into the sharky deep from the point
at Chowder Bay on the 26th inst., and various
concerts and minstrel and other shows are to cast
a radiance over the season of the plum-pudding
and the tough fowl with the scaly blue legs.

The Jubilee Singers, with the melo
dious Orpheus M‘Adoo in charge, will trill
their pensive lay ao Sydney Centenary Hall on
Christmas and six succeeding nights. The Jubilee
Singers have always left a pleasant memory
behind them, especially the bass gentleman—
whose name The Bulletin forgets just now—who
used to be “ A Hundred Fathoms Deep.” If this
gentleman has left a worthy successor, they should
still furnish a happy medium for those persons
who are not sufficiently frivolous to go to theatres
and not quite dreary enough to find solace in
Pastor M‘Neill.

Ernest Hosking (whose portrait appears
on p. 10 of this issue), is the Melbourne com-
positor whose genius for spook manifestation has
been several times referred to in The Bulletin
during the past half-dozen years. When Dr.
McCarthy started to advertise his simple faith
The Bulletin casually mentioned that a Mel-
bourne wizard could perform all the spiritualistic
fakes of the time, and explain how they came to
pass—for a reasonable consideration. Hosking is
that same wizard. The present writer has an old,
but still vivid, recollection of fixing the gentle-
man up in a black bag in the darkened room of a
mutual friend. A seance committee of two, in-
cluding the writer, placed a hand on either of
Hosking’s knees to make sure that he didn’t shift
from the bag, but before the gas was turned up
again, revealing him in his original helpless con-
dition, the spirits had given the committee
sundry severe prods from the rear, in addition
to a liberal display of rough and ready phenomena.
Hoskings, at that time, was a comparative novice
in the black art, but already he had been ap-
proached, with a view to business, by local hum-
bugs, who told him he was an “ unconscious
medium,” and implored him to participate in their
lucrative swindles instead of giving the game
away gratis. Hosking is just a born trickster,
with a peculiar talent for getting at the secret of
Mellonic or other mysteries. He can master the
details of any sort of “ wonder” show at one sit-
ting.

the capacity of Arrah’s best bhoy, was hastily pro-

Truth is partly sacrificed to circumstances in the,

one to say that the comedian makes a bright
Shaun the Post, but rhyme has to be considered
before reason, therefore “glimmer” must stand.
Mr. Shine, anyway, doesn’t wipe out recollections
of several bigger, broader, heartier predecessors,
although he forms an agreeable contrast to the
average peasant of Irish drama. He is a keen,
clean, gay and sprightly actor, who seems in-
capable of deep feeling on the stage. He receives

The deposit receipts of the City of Melbourne
Bank are now for sale at 10s. in the £,, while buyers offer
only Bs. This woeful drop plainly means that some
people who either are, or think they are, “in the know”
nave lost all reasonable hope of the City of Melbourne
pulling through under existing conditions. The Mel-
oourne Board of Works, by the way, has a reconstructed
deposit of £330,000—a part of that loan for which Fitz-
gibbon was so “shamefully squeezed” in London—in
this unhappy institution. If the City of Melbourne had a
little available cash on hand, it could wipe off a lot of its
liabilities at a very cheap rate by buying up its deposits at
present prices, but apparently it hasn’t the cash. Or if
the Turner Government cared to come to its assistance
by offering 2J per cent, debentures to its creditors in lieu
of their claims, the offer, in the present condition of
affairs, would probably be accepted with signs of great
Joy. Then the State could take over the deposits at 3 per
cent., and boss the institution until its liabilities were
discharged. Judging by the stock exchange barometer,
nothing short of this is likely to meet the emergency.
The City of Melbourne represents, at present,
the lowest depth in the banking business. Colonial Bank
deposits sell at 12s. 6d.; Commercial of Australia, 15s.
and (for long-dated deposits) 12s. 6d.; English, Scottish
and Australian vary from 12s. to 15s. 3d.; London, 109.;

Among the Melbourne banks, the National is the only one
whose ordinary shares are saleable. Preference shares of
the City of Melbourne are valueless ; those of the National
(£lO paid) fetch t 6; Victoria (£lO paid), £5; Colonial

About the last possible disaster has struck the
shareholders of the Bank of New Zealand, in the shape of
a call of £3 6s. Bd. per share. Most of the shares are
already fully paid up, in name at all events, but when the
Maoriland Government came to the rescue of the bank
an Act was passed according to which the liability was
made practically unlimited. Under this new arrange-
ment, in order that a call should be made, the
auditors have only to certify that the bank’s assets
are unequal to its liabilities, or that “an emergency
has arisen which makes a call or calls expedient,” and
apparently the emergency has arisen in the present
instance. The £500,000 which is to be raised is to be
devoted to paying off debentures of the B.N.Z. Estates
Cos., and thereby undoing, in part at least, and at great
expense, one of the most awful pieces of finance in
modern times. The debentures of the Estates Co.—which
company is simply the B.N.Z. under another name—
were floated in London at something like £96 net
for each £IOO debenture; they bear interest at the
exorbitant rate of 5£ per cent., and they were to be
redeemed in the year 1910 at £lO3. The bank, however,
is privileged to pay them off before maturity at £lO5,
and it is cheaper to make even this sacrifice than carry
the ghastly burden any longer. Yet there is a wild
humor about that species of finance by which an institu-
tion has to pay a premium of nearly £7o,ooo—for that is
what it amounts to if all the Estates Co.’s debentures are
taken up—for the privilege of paying its own debts.
When the present call is collected the proba-
bilities are that the Bank of New Zealand will at last find
itself in comparatively smooth water. With its enormous
paid-up capital, however, and its expensive 4 per cent,
preference stock, dividends will probably be very small
for many years to come. One thing is certain, that no
other bank in these provinces has stood so many shocks,
and so many reconstructions, and yet survived. The old
B.N.Z. has, to all intents and purposes, been written off
bodily, and the present institution is entirely new. The
effect upon the shareholders is virtually the same as if
the institution had liquidated in 1888, and anew one had
been started on its ruins. Meanwhile shares are, accord-
ing to the cable, being offered in London on an entirely
new basis, the seller giving the scrip gratis and paying
15s. per share to anybody who will take it away. The
investment ought to be a reasonably good one at the
price.
♦ * * *
The National Mutual Assurance Society’s
balance-sheet reads well, so far as the revenue account is
concerned, considering the awful depression of the past
year. The premium income (£208,000) is only £4OOO less
than in 1893, and the falling-off is entirely owing to sur-
renders by stone-broke policy-holders. The new business
shows a marked improvement. The expenses are practi-
cally the same as last year, and £91,754 have been added
to the accumulated funds of the society. Last year the
addition made was £113,700, but the difference is fully
accounted for by the extra £20,000 paid away during 1894
in surrenders. The interest received on investments
(£73,059) is £2OOO more than last year, and very nearly
covers all claims during the twelve months, and in all
respects the figures show substantial progress.
The investment account, however, shows sundry
features which may be capable of satisfactory explana-
tion, but which, on the surface of tilings, tend to excite
comment. An item of £65,655 for building society sh res
which item, by the way, has increased by £9OOO during
the year —may be thoroughly sound, but considering that
very many building institutions are more or less dubious
in these times, it would be well to give the names of the
societies, in order 10 show that they are among the few
concerns which are absolutely above suspicion. A sum of
£IOI,OOO is on fixed deposit in Victoria, and it wool I be
interesting to know in what bank it is fixed, and bow
much fixed it really is. Some Victorian fixed deposits are
a very feeble kind of security nowadays; others are as
good as can be desired. Also, the item “accrued in-
terest” stands at nearly £19,000. If this mean* both
interest accrued and interest outstanding it is entirely
satisfactory. If it means only what it says, then the
outstanding interest is wholly unaccounted for, and
as it may be safely asserted that an institution
of such dimensions as the National Mutual, with an
income from investments of £73,000 per annum, can-
not possibly avoid having a certain amount of arrears, the
most reasonable inference in this case is that they are
made invisible to the naked eye by adding them to the
amount of the mortgages. Under such circumstances it
is impossible to tell what the arrears amount to, and the
security or otherwise of the investments can’i be esti-
mated. Every insurance society’s balance sheet ought to
show the outstanding interest as a separate item, and to
avoid misconception the National Mutual should seriously
consider this matter.
Another noteworthy asset is “ Deferred instal-
ments of annual premiums on policies in force” t'45,000.
If this means, as it appears to do, that where premiums
are paid quarterly or half-yearly in advance, instead of
annually in advance, the society takes credit for the
balance of the year’s premium as an asset, the proceeding
is open to some question. At all events, no such item
appears in the balance-sheet of any other of the big life
offices of Australasia. Altogether, the accounts of the
National Mutual—like those of many other offices—might
be made a good deal more explicit with advantage.
* * ♦ ♦
The shareholders in the old Bank of South
Australia will probably be struck at an early date with a
call of £l2 10s. per share. When the Bank of S.A. was
taken over by the Union it was confidently anticipated
that there would be a surplus of £BOO,OOO, after making a
very large allowance for depreciation, but the alleged
surplus entirely faded away upon investigation, and
£350,000 worth of liabilities remain to be provided for.
The total disappearance amounts to about a mHlion and a
Quarter. Banks are evanescent things.

One result of the bank panic and consequent
commercial paralysis in Newfoundland is that £500,000
worth of unsaleable cod-fish are rotting in the stores and
degenerating into a feaftome mass of corruption. Most

attached to them, but such a smell as this is unprece-
dented.

The case of William M’Lean and the Federal
Bank has started again in Melbourne, but just as the
examination reached the most interesting point, Judge
Hodges, on the application of M'Lean’s counsel, ordered
the court to be cleared, and the rest of the case is to be
heard in strict privacy. Therefore, even the glimmer of
light which seemed likely to be thrown on the Federal
Bank mystery has been withdrawn, and the public is left
to form its own conjectures as to the for all this
gloom and secresy. Most people are of opinion that the
case is one which should have been heard in the Town
Hall, with free admission for everybody, so that the spot-
less purity of the defunct institution could have been
vindicated as publicly as possible, but somehow this view
doesn’t commend itself to the crowd which is laboring lor
the restoration of confidence.

B.H. Proprietary has purchased the British
concentrating plant, and proposes to erect it as part of
the sulphide plant of the new concentrating mill. When
this portion of the mill (capacity, 1400 or 1500 tons sul-
phide weekly) is equipped, the big mine will make its first
plunge in sulphide-treatment on a large scale. The
British concentrating plant, which has been idle for 18
months, is chiefly remarkable as the most eminent
example of the genus white elephant on a field abounding
with such
The smelter fumes difficulty promises to bring
the Broken Hill Proprietary Cos. into trouble before long.
The nuisance has been patiently tolerated by Broken Hill
hitherto, but the increased proportion of sulphide now
smelted causes a dreadful odour, as if the earth was all
one bad egg; and matters are coining to a head. Yet the
fumes are probably not now any more deleterious—only
more pungent —than before. The Lead Commission,
which sat when more smelters were running than at
present, found that about 15 tons of lead were volatilised
daily, a large proportion of which fell within a compara-
tively small radius of the smelters.
« ♦ ♦ ♦
Four years ago Schlapp, then metallurgist, said
that nobody would live in Broken Hill when they began
to smelt the sulphides unless the fumes were condensed.
The statement proves at least partially true. The sad-
dest feature of the lead-fume poisoning is that children in
the town (disastrously pitched right under the hill) are
most seriously attacked. Here is a typical case. A
widow, working as a charwoman, with five children, has
four of them afflicted. Two are bed-ridden, another has
brain-paralysis, the fourth has one side partially para-
lysed. Broken Hill will yield Australia a plentiful supply
of distorted idiots.

The deep prospecting work comprised in the
crosscut from the 1330 ft. level of the Extended Company’s
shaft, East towards the Broken Hill lode, being expensive
and practically hopeless, was lately suspended by the con-
tributing companies (Central, Block 10, and Extended).
The Central Cos., whose ground the crosscut was passing
through at the time of the stoppage, has since bored with
a diamond drill 140 ft. from the end of the crosscut,
reaching a point 800 ft. below the bottom of its own main
shaft. This work has since also been abandoned as hope-
less. The total distance prospected by crosscut and bore
was 680 ft.

out, and they were off to Croydon or the Towers, or some-
where. Pope’s valuation of stocks now makes the field
worth £s67,ooo—double the valuation of two years ago,
and about equal to that of five years back. Nett profits
for the year to date (divs. less calls) pay £22 7s. percent,
per annum on this capitalisation.

After spending over £BOO in connection with
the Victorian mining show, and bringing judges from
remote parts of the province to report on the various
machines, the Victorian Mines Department is actually
unable to make any awards at all in connection
with the first-class gold s iving appliances, owing, it
is reported, to a ridiculous bungle with the tailings
from the different machines, said tailings having been
mixed up somehow, so that no one knows where each
sample belongs to. One exhibitor spent over £125 in
connection with the show, and has been waiting patiently
for five weeks for his expected prize. He will probably
have to wait 50 years now. Some of the exhibitors talk

NOTICE TO AGENTS.
Owing to the great demand /or the Xmas
issue of “ The Bulletintve regret that
we are unahle to fulfil any orders received
after Thursday, 13th inst.
N.S.W. Judge Foster, who has been more
or less incapacitated by illness ever since he
mounted the bench, now definitely retires from
the Supreme Court. G. B. Simpson, Attorney-
General in the Reid Cabinet, takes his pi ice ;
while Jack Want, who a little while ago announced
that he was sick and tired of politics, becomes
Attorney-General. Foster has been a bad specu-
lation for the taxpayer ; he was too feeble for his
billet, and barely served half the prescribed tir n
before he was compelled to “ accept ” his pensu n
and become an honorable and reasonably pi;
turesque burden on his suffering country.
Simpson is also far past the prime of life, and, in
the natural order of things, his retirement on a
pension, owing to physical weakness, should
already be almost in sight. Judgeships, in N.S.
Wales, are now, to a great extent, a reward for
living to an advanced age and being a respectable
invalid, and, in the interests of economy, it is
about time for a new departure.
Author Robert Louis Stevenson died sud-
denly of brain paralysis at Samoa on Dec. 3, aged
44. An invalid from his youth, he sapped his
scant energy at the toilsome trade of letters, and
has suffered 10 years’ more life than reasonable
expectation would have granted. Yet though he
bravely bartered Being for Seeming, the fame
which rewarded him came too soon to stay, and
his last days were clouded by the suspicion that
he had outlived a reputation which he never
wholly merited. The Stevenson cult was chiefly
founded on the arts of academic reclame to which
the Andrew Lang coterie owes so much. It was
upheld by the praise of Mr. Gladstone, who is
everything but a good critic ; and by the admira-
tion of the literary school which prefers the play of
words to the display of worth. The obedient public
echoed the applause of its leaders ; but Stevenson,
who was only a philosopher in his books, may be
counted fortunate in living to see but the be-
ginning of Time’s revulsion. Little of his work
will linger long after him. He owed nothing to the
originality of genius, everything to the toil of
talent. He strove hard to satisfy the clamour of
his friends for a great book, but its material was
not in him ; and even that public taste which he
himself describes as “a mongrel product, out of
affectation by dogmatism,” would not be put off
with the showy performances in which he tried to
make style do duty for thought. His novels are
mere juvenilities, pleasant and impermanent. His
best work is in his essays, which embalm some of
the most exquisite prose in the English language.
But Stevenson’s art, with all its miraculous imita-
tion of simplicity, never reached the strength of
nature. His work is marvellously gilded, but it is
not gold. It was pathetic to see him struggling in
his Samoan refuge to produce the masterpiece
which his premature notoriety demanded by way
of justification. He taxed himself to the utmost,
and now the poor overdriven brain has given way,
and his memory remains, not indeed that of the
great writer which he hoped to be, but that of a
clever man of letters who has done good service in
his day and generation.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Shirley Baker was succeeded as Tongan
Premier by Basil Thomson, son of the late Arch-
bishop of York. Basil is publishing a book on

candid opinion on the character of his pre-
decessor.
Dr. Odillo Maher, the well-known Sydney
oculist who was hurt in the Redfern railway
accident, has sufficiently convalesced to return to
his home. His eyesight is happily quite restored,
and his other injuries have left no permanent
ill-effects.
A tale was whispered and scouted some
years ago that a certain Judge was given to seek-
ing clairvoyant aid before summing up for or
against prisoners. And only the other day in a
Sydney court the widow of a J.P. deposed on
..ath, during the hearing of a fortune-telling case,
that her deceased husband constantly sought
occult aid in adjudicating.
WhenNesbit, the Adelaide Q.C.,
was in London recently, a gentle-
man at one of the Bohemian clubs
enquired, “ By-the-bye, old man, what
place is Adelaide the capital of?” And
while Nesbit was trying to swallow his
indignation and speak coherently,
Harold Frederic, the author, chipped
in, “ If it’s a secret, you know, we don’t
wish to press the question.”
A certain Minister who is an
Australian University man has for his
Under-Secretary an English University
man. The Minister recently ran his
blue pencil through and through one of
the U.S.’s minutes, wrote beside the
scored paragraph, “ Put this in Eng-
lish,” and returned the U.S. the paper.
Apropos, a former Sydney Lands Office
Minister once ordered Under-Secretary
Charles Oliver to re-write a minute.
Oliver, however, admitted the superior
comprehension of his chief by non-
compliance with the demand ; he laid
the whole matter before the Minister
to sift and decide. Which the Minister
did. Mr. Oliver was modest for a
week ; he merely submitted every paper
to the superior intelligence of the Min-
ister. That Minister “grafted ;” Oliver
sat still in his room. On the first day
of the second week he was waited on
by the Minister, who humbly said :
“For God’s sake, Mr. Oliver, write
your minutes and I will sign them.”
Mr. Oliver cheerfully complied. From
the day Oliver became U.S. for Lands,
that Dept, was Oliver’s, and every
Minister who took charge of it soon
reconciled himself to the fact. It was
Oliver who changed the dignified title
of Surveyor-General to Chief Surveyor,
and the salary of the post from £l2OO
to £BOO per annum.
Since the Age began to advocate a land-
tax about a bushel of letters arrives each week
addressed, “David Syme, Father of Lies, Mel-
bourne,” and little things like that. The Fat

very much lacking in originality.
Robert Louis Stevenson had a birthday
recently, and, according to the Star, he went
without his boots in honour of the event. A good
many Australians seem to be keeping their birth-
days in the same fashion, nowadays ; also some of
them seem to have been born almost all the year
round.
F. C. Gray, the nervous draper who
represents Prahran in Victorian Assembly, never
makes a speech without ringing in the dreary
metaphor about “leaving footprints on the sands of
time.” It is the only figure of speech he has got,
and if it were confiscated he would sink into utter
silence.
R. G. Symonds, who under Captain Light
helped to carry out the survey of Adelaide in
1836, was born on Dec. 23, 1810. He still lives in
the city whose cradle he assisted to rock, but he
is growing very feeble. He is as poor now as one
of Douglas Sladen’s “ poems,” and almost as little
remembered.
An old Yass (N.S.W.) identity passed
away last week in the person of “ Mick ” Cassidy,
a mounted policeman of 60 years ago. In 1838
he was wounded by a bushranger with whom he
got into close quarters, and was rewarded by the
Imperial Govt, with a pension. Pensioners are a
long-lived race.
A reporter was taken on the staff of a
metropolitan newspaper lately on the express
condition that while representing the paper he
would make no speeches on public affairs. After
a short trial the temptation to howl mastered his
desire for the “ready,” and the same old orator
harangues the army of the night.
In an Adelaide bookseller’s shop is a draw-
ing by “Mortimer Menpes, 1868” —a pencil
sketch of an English oak, a very mediocre produc-
tion; but Menpes must have been a mere boy then.
There is an Adelaide man, by the way, who re-
members with pride giving office-boy Mortimer
clip on the ear for caricaturing the boss.
It was seriously rumoured that Carington
would get the order of K.G. in succession to the
late Earl Grey. At latest dates Lord Dufferin
was said to be the coming man for this appalling
honor, but evidently Carington’s leg will wear a
Garter before he dies. The historic yawner is
even likely to achieve a dukedom at last by means
of his genius for doing nothing in a cheerful,
courtly way.
When Hori Grey visited a certain Maori-
land town, some 15 years ago, he held a korero
with the Maoris of the district. On the chief
being presented to Grey, a fussy little local trades-
man, with a smattering of the native language,
officiously bustled to the front and acted as inter-
preter, and Grey, who knows Maori better, per-
haps, than any other white man in the province,
with his usual calm courtesy, let him interpret to
his heart’s content, and never even smiled.
J. H. Angas, the S.A. millionaire squatter
and philanthropist, has stopped his subscription
to Adelaide Hospital on the ground that “ it is a
Government institution,” and he has to get square
with the Government somehow for imposing the
new land-tax. Angas has just recovered from a
long and painful shearing, in the course of which
his flocks have been much mangled by cheap
blackleg labor ; and he is probably rather more in-
furiated than usual in consequence. It doesn’t
take much to infuriate the average wealthy philan-
thropist.

W. F. Molesworth, admitted as a barrister
and solicitor by Melbourne Supreme Court last
week, is son of Judge Hickman Molesworth, of
the Insolvency Court, and grandson of old “Billy
Rutledge,” of Warrnambool, one of the early

third generation of the family who have practised
at the Victorian bar.

Jules Joubert, they say, hasn’t found his
Hobart Exhibition billet a bed of roses, thus far.
One night he was called to reprove a truculent in-
dividual who wanted to enter the building with a
lighted cigar in his mouth. The man flung his
hot weed at Joubert’s nose and a personal conflict
ensued. The tide of battle carried the energetic
Frenchman, who is not young any more, clean off
his official legs.
A New South Wales J.P., of large girth
and impressive presence, carries Court ethics into
the bosom of his family. Erring domestics are
brought before him, and evidence is taken, and
fines or deprivation of luxuries allotted in due
order. His wife committed flagrant contempt of
this court lately, in refusing to be tried before the
assembled household for an unseemly altercation
with the cook. The contempt has yet to be
purged.
The discussion re the authenticity of Fitz-
Gibbon’s claim to be the descendant of the original
White Knight of Kerry is gravely continued in
Melb. Age, and is very sickenin’ indeed. It does
not seem to have occurred to David Syme that
not one in 5000 of his readers cares a copper about
the descent of the stupendous egotist of the Met-
ropolitan Board. It would be interesting to trace
Fitz back to the original Gibbon, but no one
worries about the White Knight of Kerry.
Dear Bulletin, —Hutton’s “Irish-rabble”
episode brings to memory a somewhat similar inci-
dent many years ago. When Anderson (son of
the Norfolk Island Commandant of the thirties)
bossed the “forces” in Victoria, he had occa-
sion to address the “troops” at a birthday review,
or some such function. The Franco-Prussian war
was in full blast, France being, more or less, under-
neath. Anderson, in praising his amateur soldiery,
recited the old, old wheeze that “ one Englishman
was worth three Frenchmen.” The beastly re-
porters got hold of it, and the newspapers belched
forth at the colonel. Also, almost every French-
man in Victoria, including the consul, challenged
him to fight with all manner of weapons. Ander-
son didn’t fight—in fact, he was scarcely visible
for some weeks while the riot was at its worst— but
he was a much more peaceful colonel thereafter.

John Thompson, the Canadian Premier,
died last week of syncope, the result of being
invited to Windsor Castle to dine with his
Sovereign Lady. If Dibbs had been troubled
with a weak heart he would have expired sud-
denly under similar circumstances three years
ago. It is said to be a terrible ordeal for one who
doesn’t know the etiquette of Courts —this “com-
mand ” to “ dine and sleep” at Windsor Castle.
Nobody makes the stranger welcome or tells him
just what he ought to do when he gets there. He
is carried away to a bedroom by supercilious
flunkeys, and when he ventures downstairs he is in
mortal terror of meeting the Queen in some corri-
dor, where he ought not to stray, before she has
given him a formal audience. The preliminary
horrors of this visit broke up John Thompson’s
constitution, and during luncheon he collapsed.
They gave him a stiff dose of brandy, “which
somewhat revived him.” But shortly afterwards
the unfortunate politician breathed his last. He
didn’t wait for dinner, but it made little differ-
ence ; the dinner would inevitably have proved
fatal, anyhow. The verdict is that John Thomp-
son, K.C.M.G., died of pomps and vanities, and
Victoria Regina ought to be more careful for the
future.
Schey, M.P., is not the only man who will
be glad to see the last of N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioner Eddy. Not long ago a Minister sent to
him a son of one of his constituents with a most
fulsome letter of recommendation for a billet in
the railway department. The Chief Commissioner
read the letter, and, after asking the boy some-
thing equivalent to how many beans make five,
and getting “four’’for an answer, he turned up
the corner of the letter and wrote : “Seeing that
Mr. So-and-so would be such a desirable addition
to the public service, perhaps the Hon. Blank
could find room for him in his own department.”
Objection was made by a section
of that close guild, the Law, against
the admission of George Ash, M.P.
(S. A.) on the ground that while serving
his articles he worked and earned
money as a member of Parliament. An
incipient barrister, for a certain number
of years before he is called to the bar,
is supposed to do nothing save live on
his property and think over the
statutes, after the manner of those
philosophers who accumulated wisdom
by gazing hard at their own stomachs.
If he is found earning his living by
any honest occupation it is absolutely
fatal to his legal prospects. The Court
ruled, however, that an M.P. doesn’t
“earn” money; he only receives it.
So Ash got through.
Dunedin (M.L.) has lost one of
its old landmarks. “Holy John’’
has pegged out. “Holy John,” an
angular, wild-eyed person in old boots
and ancient black clothes, was the
Jonah of the dreary little city, and for
19 years or more he wandered up and
down the streets calling out occasion-
ally in a cracked voice that the day
of judgment was at hand. Some of
John’s most impressive homilies were
delivered while he was spinning three
feet high in the air and clapping his
heels together, while the dilapidated
tails of his long black coat flew out
behind him like pennons. He gener-
ally carried a large, muddy stick, which
he shook impressively at unbelievers.
No one knew exactly how he lived, but
every day, in rain or snow or shine, he
fled up Pnnees-street telling people as
he passed that they were lost, and
fled down again an hour or two later
stating that the day of resurrection
had come. “Holy John” was one of
the institutions of the city, and Dunedin
will seem lonely without him. He
died of no defined complaint; probably
he ran himself to death in his daily
pilgrimage.
Frank Bowerman, who suicided a few
days ago in Sydney Botanic Gardens by taking a
variety of poisons, was, 20 or 30 years ago, O.P.S.
at Dalby (Q.). He had a misguided ambition to
be a police-magistrate, and, failing to secure the
appointment, he went to Brisbane and attacked
the Under 001.-Secretary, Manning, in his
own office with an axe. Manning was supposed
to be permanently disabled by his injuries, and
by a special Act of Parliament, rushed through
by the Mackenzie Mini-try, he was pensioned off
with <£ooo a year, which liberal allowance he has
enjoyed in good health and spirits for 25 years,
and seems likely to enjoy for many years to come.
Bowerman was sentenced to imprisonment for
life, but was released, mainly through the un-
wearied efforts of his wife, after 12 years’ confine-
ment. The devoted lady died a few hours before
her husband’s discharge from prison, and Bower-
man, an elderly and broken man, thereafter made
a precarious livelihood at a variety of pursuits
until his death. According to a letter which he
left behind him, he made two unsuccessful
attempts to commit suicide with prussic acid.
His last effort was with strychnine and atropine,
and he had four other poisons in his possession,
evidently that he might fall back on them in case
of necessity. A man who couldn’t shuffle out of
life with six bottles of poison would indeed be
unlucky.

Sydney for shooting Thomas Heavey.
The new Czar of Russia, says London
Figaro, “is little in every sense of the word. He
is consumed with arrogance and conceit, and in
character is the most weak-kneed, vacillating,
slack-baked scion that the house of Romanoff has
produced. During his tour in India, the insuffer-
able hauteur which he assumed towards the nobles
who formed his retinue was everywhere remarked
upon. These nobles are men who may one day
drag him off his throne.” Meanwhile, the poten-
tate stands a good chance of getting blown off his
throne.


ADVICE TO PARENTS.
Ip your son in his tender years evinces a desire to
smoke, and thus risks injuring his health, it may
not always be wise to thrash him till he makes up
his mind to stop. In most cases an excellent
remedy is an old pipe soured by long experience
and administered without pity but very strong
tobacco. Above all things avoid letting him ever
get a taste of Frossard’s Cavour Cigars, for then
he will never, never give it up. Keep him for ever
in ignorance of the glorious fact that for a shilling
he may get every wh re a packet of eight of these
mild and aromatic cigars.

Mrs. D. M’Loake, Wakefield, N.Z., who writes
on May 19th, 1893 It gives me the greatest of
pleasure to testify to the good effects of your
wonderful Clements Tonic. My complaint was
indigestion accompanied by heartburn and windy
spasms, which were very painful, leaving me very
weak, unfitting me for attending to my household
duties. I got one of your pamphlets from our
storekeeper, read its contents, and of people who
had been cured by taking Clements Tonic, hope
sprang up in my breast and I determined to give
it a trial. I got some of it and its effects have
proved really wonderful. I also give it to my
children when anything is the matter with them,
in fact, I keep it as a family medicine. When any
of our children complain I at once consult your
book, which just states their ease. Two or three
doses pub them all right. I recommend it to all

county gaol is .£24. In 1870,
when the Education Act was
passed, there were 30,000 per-
sons in gaols and prisons in
England and Wales. In 1890,
with an increase in population
of four millions, the number
had fallen to 19,000. In 1870
there were 113 convict estab-
lishments to be maintained.
In 1892 practically one-half the

politicians who want to econo-

brought on by excitement and
grief. A woman went mad
on hearing of the crime and

him out. That senile organ of fatheadedness re-

Argus report of a certain Ballarat banquet, and
called its readers to witness that the gentleman
was, in effect, a reckless liar. Argus readers are
not intelligent, as a rule, but not one in ten of
them, probably, could avoid seeing that their
valuable journal was exposing the simple truth of
Ikey’s comments. The other nine concluded that

brium —at special advt. rates.

London Times
says that Premier Nel-
son’s resistance to the
proposed increased pay-
ment of members in
Queensland inspires
confidence in the loan

minded Times imagines
that the Boodlewraith
objects to payment of
members on purely
economical grounds.
Miss Shaw, in her
hurried gallop through
the country, evidently
never learned that loans
are floated in Queens-
land principally, so far
as can be seen by the
naked eye, for the pur-
pose of leaving the
money on deposit with
the Q.N. Bank, and
that payment of mem-
bers is objectionable
mainly because it tends
to bring in a crowd of
men who don’t take
any hind of friendly
interest in the Q.N.
Bank.
In receiving a Sydney unemployed depu-
tation, the other day, N.S.W. Premier Reid said
he would find bread and, if possible, work for the
needy, but he would have nothing to do with
“ professional agitators.” Now, Premier Reid is
himself a barrister—a man who agitates your ease,
or that of any other man, for a fee. If he is not a pro-
fessional agitator, what is he? The leading
difference between professional-agitator Reid and
professional-agitator Tompkins, of “the Statue,”
is that Reid belongs to a strongly-entrenched
trades-union and Tompkins doesn’t.
N.S.W. Premier Reid’s logic is unanswer-
able that there can be no conference between the
Legislative Assembly and the Council concerning
the rights of either body. If the Assembly, upon
the Council’s declaration that it possessed the
power to amend money-bills, yielded a conference
in order to debate that point, it would virtually
concede the whole contention. Provided the
Assembly is going to stick to its point—as it must
do if the land and income-taxes are ever to become
| aw —then there is nothing to confer about. The
whole matter is already decided so far as the
Assembly is concerned. If it confers it gives its
case away.
A Melbourne firm was recently convicted
of branding its inferior guns with the name of
a famous maker, and escaped with a nominal
punishment. Being asked in Parliament if any
further action was to be taken in the matter,
Premier Turner replied that he “was placed
rather awkward position, because the firm in
question were clients of his in the action brought
against them by the gun-makers whose name was
improperly used.” Thus Turner in his private
capacity defends the action in which the Govern-
ment —which is mainly Turner in his public
capacity—is the plaintiff. Consequently, both
sides of the case are Turner. Evidently Turner
is a lawyer first and then a premier, and his
“ awkward position ” is nothing to that of the
country whose prime minister’s public actions are
hobbled by his private interests.
The success of the new Cannalin remedies

When the Chinee
fantan-player becomes
the prey of the Austra-
lian bobby, the use of
the oriental queue is
illustrated practically.
Six big Cobar (N..S-W.)
policemen rounded up
29 Chinese, the other
evening, and marched
them safely to the lock-
up. The command was
that “ Indian file ” was
to be observed, and
that each Chinaman
(except the first) was to
lay hold of the pigtail
in front of him. This
is more humane than
the old Vic. method of
tying the Chinese to-
gether in pairs, queue
by queue, and then
binding their arms
behind their backs.
Either system is pic-
turesque, but the old
Victorian vogue pro-
voked much squeal.

Hobart Exhibition proved a wet place for
a certain “Commission” representing an Aus-
tralian province. The commissioners managed to
get through about 35 cases of champagne in the
first four days.
By the way, one official personage sailed for
Hobart with a couple of beauteous ladies in tow,
but on the Exhibition opening night he was
shocked by the news that one of the sultanas had
thrown off her allegiance and disappeared. Then
ensued a wild, unsober hunt for the missing lady
by the bereaved gentleman and a number of in-
fluential friends. The members of the search-
party had strict injunctions to seize the stray
charmer by fair means or foul, and cart her back
to the “protector’s” hotel. The adventurers
returned in due course, bringing each of them a
female ruin in the last stage of dishevelment, who
had willingly pleaded guilty to being the lost
Venus. Six or more grinning harridans arrived
at the hotel in cabs, heralded by cries of “ I’ve
found her, dear boy,” from the captors. When
they had each in turn been disowned by the chief
of the expedition, they joined forces and began to
“ play up ”on the hotel steps. Finally the land-
lord turned a hose upon the struggling mass of
distinguished visitors, and peace was at length
restored. The fate of the nymph that escaped is
still shrouded in doubt.

Cardinal Moran, when he ridicules Win-
deyer and Co. for guaranteering the authenticity
of Mrs. Spook Mellon, touches a subject that a
wiser Cardinal would have let alone. The same
remark applies to every other parson who takes a
hand in the controversy. Mrs. Mellon lives on
the ghosts of Cissie and Josephine. The Church
lives on the ghosts of Samuel, Lazarus and others.
The Mellon female attests that the alleged ghost
which you can see is genuine ; the Church attests
that the alleged ghost which some unknown
writer tells ns that Saul was told the witch of
Endor saw was also genuine. The dubious spectre
of 2700 years ago has no right to throw stones at
the dubious spectre of to-day.

followed by several vehicles, private and hired ; moved

Church of England in Glenlyon Road East, where a por-
tion of the burial service was performed by the Rev. C.
M. Bardine, the choir rendering their portion of the ser-
vice in an especially meritorious manner. After the
service the Cortege re-formed and now headed by the
Sunday-school fellows and friends of the deceased little
one; proceeded along the Sydney Road, until the
Cemetery was reached where they opened out in proper
military style, allowing the Funeral to pass through, and
then following on. The Rev. Mr. Bardine now leading to
the grave-side where the burial service was completed,
and after the choir and children had sung “There’s a
home for little Children,” the grave was filled. The
ranks of scholars then re-formed for the return march,
and all was over. The display of floral offerings was very
large ; and the coffin which was covered with figured
plush, and silver lace, and mountings, called forth especial
comment.

the fact that so many of the crew got away leaving

their bravery and usefulness. And no one is any

The chief items of interest at Alfred

tumbler 100 years old and an armchair, formerly
the property of Governor Gipps. The portrait of
the ex-Chief Justice by Thomas Griffiths Wain-
wright didn’t appear.

A wholesale surprise was occasioned last
week by the remarkable poverty of the late Alfred
Stephen’s much-advertised library, and consider-
able disgust was excited among buyers when it
became known that, after the announcement of
the sale, the leading feature of the library—the
ex-Chief Justice’s large collection of rare Austra-
lian pamphlets—had been privately sold for £75.
The executors, no doubt, thought they were
making a good bargain, but, as it happens, six of
the works sold would easily bring, in the open
market, £5 to =£lo apiece.

About the funniest tug-of-war on record
was between Chinese and Hindoos, on the closing
night of the St. Patrick’s Gamble at Melb. Exhibi-
tion. At the start a Chinese-cwm-Hindoo equiva-
lent for a ringing cheer went up, and then
Mongolians and Hindoos poured into the ring,
unable to contain themselves as quiet spectators.
The suave smiling Chows skipped about like mad
things fanning individual members of their team
with handkerchiefs, hats, sashes, coats, and other
apparel. They danced around in their puffed-
out pantaloons, jumping spasmodically up and
down, sideways, here and there and everywhere,
with their arms, legs, heads, little round bodies
and baggy breeches and sleeves going in all direc-
tions. Grotesque-looking Chinamen, well up in
years, leaped high into the air in their crazy excite-
ment, yelling, shrieking, and bellowing all the
while, and came down most unholy croppers,
often on bundles of live crackers. Then an Indian
would fall over the prostrate Chow, be sworn at,
and reciprocate. Three or four of both tribes
would join in the argument, and start scruffing
each other. Next, all the Celestials in the shindy
but one would look round, see their team gain an
inch or two of the rope, and, with a joyous shout,
rush off waving their arms and legs frantically,
and try to fan somebody, it didn’t matter whom,
and dance about and scream. The remaining
Chow was forthwith set on by the other four
Indians and pummelled. Then a Chinkie, who
had run away, would suddenly recollect that the
fight had to be attended to, single out the first
Hindoo he saw, walk up and hit him. Thus fight
followed fight, yet they didn’t seem to mean any
harm, and no accidents happened. Every now
and then, two or three policemen would collar a
frenzied Chow, and eject him over the ropes, but
a dozen rushed to fill the breach, and the
confusion was intensified. The Indians were
getting beaten. With the national honor in
jeopardy, several of their barrackers resolved on
heroic remedies, and earnestly laid into the whole
team right and left, with ugly-looking sticks. It
was suggestive of a rowed-out eight being pitched
into with a stock-whip by the cox. to make them
quicken up a trifle. However, it was no go, and
the Indians were gradually hauled over. Then
the fun began again. Crowds of Mongolians
hoisted their men shoulder high, and cantered
excitedly round the grounds, while others rushed
wildly all over the place in ineffable ecstacy,
shaking hands with all and sundry. Groups of
humorous Caucasian youth took to raising on their
shoulders every Chow they could catch and rush-
ing him into the refreshment - room or into
Nicholson-street, or the Lord only knows where.
Meanwhile the Indians cursed at large, but no
one heeded them. When they got in the road
the victorious Chinamen and their barrackers
simply rushed over them, and at last they gathered
themselves together and sneaked sorrowfully
away. #

The Bulletin respectfully suggests to
Messrs. Windeyer and Co. that the best way to
test Mrs. Mellon would be to lock up the lady in
a large iron safe, with one small hole in the top
for ventilation—said safe being lent for the occa-
sion by some well-known dealer, who will receive
a handsome bonus if the spirits don’t get out.
Then put a cordon of detectives round the safe,
deposit conveniently a large dish of boiling water
for the apparition to step into, and wait results.
Justice Hodges, reversing the Fitts decree
nisi in Melb. Divorce Court: “ I cannot hope that
these persons will ever live together, or that the
marriage will be any good to themselves or society.
But I am unwillingly driven to the conclusion
that I must allow the bond to stand.” The
Church and the Law agree on one matrimonial
point. When there is very little chance of the
parties living together any more the bond must
not be broken.
• • •
One of the earliest causes of suspicion
against Mrs. Mellon, the Sydney spookist, was
the constant and unaccountable variation in the
dimensions of “Cissy.” “Cissy” was of many
different heights, and her total variation was
something like two feet. Of course no one can
assert definitely that a ghost has any exact
stature, but the general impression was that
“Cissy” carried her want of any definite resem-
blance to herself altogether too far. Another
complaint was that Mrs. Mellon and “ Geordie ”
would never speak simultaneously. Unless some
method can be discovered by which a medium can
talk twice at the same time, this discrepancy
seems incurable.

Why is it that when a parson, like
Garnsey, drops dead in his harness, all the world
wonders? The common cart-horses of commerce
and the bony mill-horses of labor drop dead daily
and hourly, and a busy world does not so much
as lift its head from its ledger to see what the row
is about.
Within one week recently six cases of sui-
cide were reported in various parts of Australia,
in each of which the leading character got up
early in the morning and disposed of himself.
Also, a Maoriland woman, suffering from tem-
porary derangement, got up early and threw her-
self over a cliff 250 feet high, and escaped almost
uninjured. One of the first really sensational
suicides in Victoria, by the way, was that of an
itinerant preacher who got up at 4 o’clock on the
morning after his marriage, and nearly hacked
his head off with a blunt saw. This tendency on
the part of the suicide to get up early—or, rather,
the tendency on the part of people who get up
early to commit suicide—is a matter which should
lie scientifically investigated.
# * •
The Church of England self-denial week,
in Victoria, has raised about half Bishop Goe’s
annual screw.
# # *
A Maoriland Wesleyan authority writes
to the papers to explain away the church’s alleged
greed and inhumanity in the case of old Probert,
the recent suicide. John Probert, he points out,
left his fortune, amounting to .£7OO or £lBOO a
year, in trust to the Wesleyan Church, to be used
for certain sectarian purposes, and, therefore, even
though the sect knew that its benefactor’s brother
was old and poor and infirm, it couldn’t legally
make him even the smallest allowance out of the
fund. Which is doubtless true, and would be
sufficiently convincing but for the obvious fact
that the church could have made him a small
allowance out of some other fund if it felt that
way inclined. The apology is only another evi-
dence that explanation is one of the fine arts which
few men ever acquire.

made an income of J 3900 in 1889. In 1894, he
made exactly .£l3O. He dates the beginning of
the falling off from the time when he married a
girl who wasn’t related to a Judge.

The carcase of Rue Australia is at last
becoming distinctly visible and smellable. The
barque Royal Tar about the only pawnable
local asset—was the chief bone of contention
between the Casey crowd and the Lane-Head
crowd, and Gilbert Casey now announces regret-
fully that he gives the vessel and the rest of the
Association’s property in Australia up for lost.
In addition to the original mystery of the .£2520
mortgage to Lane, another dark and haggard
narrative turns up about a lien for ,£l5OO which
another mate, Saunders, holds over the vessel.
Also, > it is stated that Mr. Peter M‘Naught
u^ ers f an d the financial situation at all,
that Mr. Head is absent from the office, and Mr.
Casey can t find him, and Mr. Saunders doesn’t
know where he is, and that Mr. Smith-Barry is
not satisfied with Mr. Casey. Owing to all these
disasters, future mates are not to entrust their
money to anyone, but are to pay their own
passages per steamer, and all officers are ejected,
and all billets declared vacant. “ Persons
desirous of leaving by the end of January are in.
vited to make immediate application to Mr.
Casey. Wanted to know : How many persons
are desirous of leaving for Paraguay by the end
of January ?

The famous “prophet” who foretold the
destruction of Maoriland by earthquake before the
end of 1894, and who induced a large number of
people including* two solicitors, sundry Civil
servants, and many old women with property—to
flee from the trouble to come, has been heard of
from South Africa. According to the latest in-
telligence, someone accuses the seer of steal-
ing <£2ooo from one of his old lady emigrants,
borne of his followers are lost in the interior
of Africa, a lot more are camping on the deso-
late highlands of Damascus, and some are pain-
fully working their passages back to Maoriland.
Yet the next prophet will boom just the same.
Ihe prophetic business is immortal.

One energetic advertiser among the Waira-
rapa passengers had himself photographed in his
alleged costume as be came ashore from the wreck,
with a life-belt in his hand, a tattered pair of
pyjamas for his sole attire, and the heaving sea for
a background. As the camera fiend didn’t arrive
till a day or two after the mishap, it is naturally
inferred that the passenger undressed himself and
re-assumed his shipwrecked attitude expressly for
photographic purposes. And, in so doing, he was
wise in his generation, for a judicious distribution
of his photo, as he came ashore in his airy costume
will help materially to boom his business, whatever
it may be. It doesn’t matter whether advertising
is relevant or not, so long as it is vigorous and
original. If Farkes could swim ashore from a
wreck and be photographed while still wet on the
beach, and the picture appeared in all the papers,
he might be Premier of N.S. Wales again inside
of a year.

A Bourke-street (Melb.) chemist displays
a complete male skeleton in his window, and all
the advanced women of the city congregate out-

soul about the advanced woman, and she naturally
gravitates towards skeletons.

From the Age report of the Dandenong
(Vic.) tragedy: “She rose early this morning,
attended to certain household duties, milked the
cow, then cut her child’s throat with a butcher’s
knife, and immediately afterwards hanged herself
to a rafter.” The fatal consequences of early-
rising onee more.

A Narandera (N.S.W.) magistrate has
ukased that half-made brews of beer shall cease
to ferment on Sunday, in honor of the sacred
memory of Charles 11., late of Hingland. Now,
will some magistrate, acccording to the same old
Sabbath law of Charles Stuart, decree that interest
on P.N.’s and overdrafts and mortgages and bills
of sale shall not accumulate on Sunday? The
usurer, when he charges interest on Sunday,
follows his worldly calling for purposes of gain,
which is distinctly illegal.

The sleepiest man in Australia was fined

Dear Bulletin, — When will the theory be
exploded that women are the gentler sex ? Going
up a steep incline on a heavily-loaded Sydney
’bus, the vehicle was stopped four times in the
space of 10 yards by women getting out and in.
The street was slippery from recent watering, and
the frantic straining, slipping and wrenching of
the poor horses in starting each time would have
moved a blackfellow, but tender-hearted woman
took no notice. I saw a party of them fooled by
the cable tram on King-street. They wanted to
stop it on the incline, but as the strain is on the
machinery, and not on flesh and blood, the grip-
man did not pull up, but waved them to the
corner. They would not walk 20 yards, but
waited and stopped the next ’bus, and the horses
nearly tore themselves asunder in making a fresh
start. —P.A.

On one of the State village settlements in
Victoria, the clean men adopt an original method
for making the dirty ones wash themselves. They
“ ringbark ” the unwashed ones by drawing a
chalk-line round them, and refuse to allow them
to come outside until they have taken a bath, a
bucket of water and a cake of soap being placed
inside the ring.

A coincidence: In Australia the same
papers which contained the news of the assassina-
tion of the Emperor Alexander 11. of Russia, also
announced the loss of the U.S.S- Oo.’s Tara r~~
with 112 1 ives. Thirteen years afterwards the
same papers which published the death of Czar
Alexander 111. also had the news of the loss of the
Union Oo.’s Wairarapa, with 127 lives. This
Rives Australia personal reason to hope the
Nihilists will give Nicholas 11. a little more rope.

“ IMITATION
is the
SINOEREST FLATTERY.”
The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as ■ regards the un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet in face of all they seem to thrive, and
the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and m if representation. They are
scientific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to
their value can be found in every district, and
such being the case it is unnecessary to further
extol their virtues.
A SONG OF THE PRESENT.
“Frivolity, frivolity !’’
Alas, where is the jollity
That used to be
In times when we
Could sing and dance and laugh and flirt,
And none could see where was the hurt ?
“Frivolity !” is all the cry,
And “ Girls are naught but vanity !”
So lie the good !
However could
The little dears be such a thing?
Let’s love them still! Life’s on the wing!
Let’s take what joy the world now has !
Let vanitatum vanitas
Go to the wind 1
Though preachers find
That all the world has since gone wrong,
Live j love ! Like this, life’s but a song !

What evil genuis presides over a Privy
Counoillorship? Consider the celerity with which
“colonial ” politicians “ pass in their cheques ” as
soon as they have been created P.C.’s! Dailey,
Stephen, Macdonald, of Canada, and now
Thompson, also of Canada, all betook themselves
from the mundane sphere almost immediately
after having been so “ honored.” Apparently
P.C. is an incurable disease.
To meet an, insistent demand that this
characteristic Australian book should be procur-
able in more permanent form, “A Golden

It contains some of the best and most original
work which has helped to make The BULLETIN
famous, and no Australian library is complete
without it.
Dr. Garran, who loses a salary of £695 a
year for doing practically nothing, thinks that
the action of the retrenchment party in squelch-
ing the useless N.S.W. Conciliation Board was a
mistake. Since the Board has decided exactly
2 cases in exactly 2£ years —or at the rate of about
£2500 a case—most people, who do not get £695 a
year for doing practically nothing, will disagree
vehemently with Dr. Garran. When Govern-
ment establishes the new system of compulsory
arbitration the expenses can easily be started
again. There is never any trouble in starting
expenses. In the meantime, the province is too
young—or too old—to pay for sinecures.
Ferdinand de Lesseps, the originator of
the two biggest swindles of the century, has died
at the age of 89. For cold-blooded infamy, the
stories of the Suez and Panama Canal schemes
have no rival. The Suez fraud was, if possible,
the more utterly heartless of the two, but there
was very little indeed to choose between them,
save in the fact that one succeeded and the
other didn’t. De Lesseps was not the “engineer
of the Suez Canal,” nor of anything else.
“I don’t know why people persist in calling
me an engineer, when I am nothing of the
kind,” he said once, “except, perhaps, in the
sense of engineering the engineers.” De Lesseps
was a bad financier and a second-rate diplomatist,
but he had much back-stairs influence with Napo-
leon 111., and Napoleon put the screw on the
Khedive so hard that that miserable Egyptian
was ultimately compelled to pay almost the whole
coat of building the canal out of his own purse,
while the ostensible capital of the Canal Co. was
spent in champagne and fireworks. The Panama
scheme failed because in that case there was no
Khedive to be looted and no Napoleon to put the
screw on.

A realistic chorus representing broken-down land-
boomers and depositors would be a novel feature for a
Melb. Xmas pantomime this year. Consider them in all
their glory—the men from the doss-house, and the Yarra
bank, and the gaol, and the Benevolent Asylum, and the
mad-house ; the dirty men, the unkempt men, the shabby-
genteel men, the ravenous, wolfish-looking men, the men
with grass-seeds in their clothes and their hair standing
up through their battered hats, the unshod men and the
men with broken boots, and the men gnawing crusts and
ham-bones, the tattered women, the children, all doing a
species of dance of death behind the footlights. The
manager who put that spectacle in the middle of a
glittering panto, would either make his fortune or be
secretly sandbagged in the street— The Bulletin doesn’t
profess to know which.
The best “all round” actress was on the wharf. A
countrywoman bumped her, and, says the all-round one,
“Are you going to walk over me? ” “Begorra, I’d sooner
walk over ye than round ye.”
A Sydney man who paid £4 to see some of Mrs. Mellon’s
so-called materialising stances, now writes that he must
have his money back or “know the reason why.” If
Mrs. Mellon used to charge .1.4 a head for admission, she
must have made a reasonable pile out of “ Geordie ” and
the rest.
The brassy voice of Mr. Roberts is probably the most
original feature of the Firm’s unfortunate comedy co.
When he appeared in the “New Boy,” most people
imagined that his galvanic manner, and part, at least, of
the brassiness of his vocal organ were assumed for the
character, but later experience showed that the owner
was simply built that way.
Maggie Moore’s show at Melbourne Royal is a triumph
of careful management in all respects, and that wonder-
ful woman will “ stand on velvet” when her pantomime
season opens.
“The Gaiety Girl ” is due at Easter with its galaxy of
feminine beauty and the adorable Riley and his legs.
W. and M.’s Comic Opera Co. will be three months in
Maoriland. After that it will probably disband, as the
leading lights—Nellie Stewart, Brownlow, Tapley, Elsie
Cameron, and, very likely, Lauri—are all going ’ome.
The matronly and massive Elsie Cameron, of the
" Firm’s ” Qpmic Opera Co., has dropped into a nice little
fortune of £BOO a year.
Pennyman, Gov. Duff’s confidential clerk, was a com-
mittee-man at Hosking’s spook-seance, on the last night
of the season, at Sydney Opera House. His business was
to retire with the conjuror, and see that he undressed
himself satisfactorily. In five minutes both returned,
Hosking in an inky suit, with the bristles of his hair more
confused than ever. Pennyman approached the floats
and said : “ Ladies and gentlemen, I have examined Mr.
Hosking carefully, and can assure you that he has abso-
lutely nothing upon him.”
The Girl of Yarmouth refused to dance for the benefit
of the Ballarat Hospital because of the tone of a section of
the press in dealing with his charitable efforts at Hobart.
Yarmouth is too sensitive for the ballet.
At least one of the persons at the Wiudeyer spook-
seance (and a signatory, by the way, of the famous certi-
ficate) distinctly declares that while she is unconvinced as
to the spirit-origin of the alleged materialisations, she is,
on the other hand, quite certain that Mrs. Mellon is notan
impostor, and does not cause the “phenomena” by
trickery. “ For,” she says, “ Mrs. Mellon hasn’t got the
brains to be an expert conjuror !”
The librettist of “Predatoros” repudiates The Bulle-
tin’s suggestion that his opera “germinated in the
‘Mountebanks’ and derived a little sustenance from the
‘ Pirates of Penzance,’” and declares that “as a fact it
was fully sketched out and partly written 14 years ago.”
Evidently the low-minded Gilbert has been borrowing
Hart’s ideas in the interim.
Williamson and Musgrove wanted Miss Orelli, the
clever Melb. amateur, for the part of Cinderella in their
Sydney pantomime, but the young singer is not open to
theatrical engagements of any kind just now. There’s a
large future in store for MissO. if she will ordy work and
wait for it. A course of pantomime training would be
the worst possible thing that could happen to a nineteen-
year-old damsel whose health and voice have not quite
recovered from a severe illness.
Alford, the Sydney constable who was
disabled—and, so far as at present appears, per-
manently disabled—by Montgomery, the burglar,
has been pensioned for 12 months at the rate of ss.
per day. After that, if his case proves hopeless,
matters are to be “reconsidered,” which means
that his pension may be continued, or reduced,
or stopped altogether. As Alford’s pay was 7s. 6d.
a day he is thus, for the present, fined by the
State one-third of his income for his services in
arresting two men whom the State decided to be
most dangerous criminals. Considering how the
then Premier, Dibbs, gushed over the “gallant
constables,” the situation is quaint.
The Loch and Ben brand of old Highland
whisky (Leo Reiss and Co., of 492 Kent-street,
Sydney, agents) is a comparatively new variety
which ought to make its way in the Australian
market. It is a mild yet potent liquor with a fine
flavor which seems, in some vague fashion, to
suggest reminiscences of rugged Scotch scenery,
and precipices, and the Children of the Mist, and
other Caledonian facts and legends. Also, it is
old and mature like the land where it has its
origin, and tastes like the bottled atmosphere of
freedom, and it is cheap, which is more important
than even the atmosphere of freedom, in times
like the present.
Parsons’ “Grains of Gold,” one of the
most nutritious foods now on sale, is steadily
creating a demand for itself in Australia. It
differs from many others mainly because it con-
tains all the valuable portions of the grain. These
portions are generally sacrificed for the sake of
color and appearance, and consequently the
ordinary flour of commerce contains little but
starch, its muscle and flesh-forming elements
having been carefully removed and thrown away.
The “ Grains of Gold ” are food prepared on the
logical principle that man eats to live ; ordinary
food is prepared on the illogical idea that he lives
to admire the color and unnatural whiteness of
his victuals.
In N.S.W. Assembly the motion to reduce
Leg. Council Chairman of Committees Jacob’s
screw from .£470 to £2 was defeated by only four
votes. This places the Council’s stipendiary
terrier in a particularly awkward dilemma.
Henceforth he must either cease his antagonism
to the Lower House in general and the Labor-party
in particular—in which case he will probably be
sacked by the Council which only appointed him
on account of his reliable Toryism —or keep on
nagging at the “ members of another place till
the four men who saved him lose their tempers
and his salary is abolished.
SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Dear Bulletin, —Australians have no room for
sneers at the English cricketers for discriminating between
“ Smith ” and “ Mr. De Vere.” We’re pretty well as bad.
For instance, the principal reason—or so it is alleged
why Billy Hnvell, the Richmond (N.S.W.) farmer, was
not included in the test match was because he is not ‘ a
society man,” and isn’t varnished up to specification!
Ughl — Yours, Jones.

George Giffen's scores against England — sB (not
out) and 64, and against Victoria—94 (not out), or 216 runs
for once out, place him easily at the head of the averages
in Australian cricket. In bowling against England he
took 12 wickets for 219 ; against Victoria, 12 for 140 or
24 wickets for 359 runs.

Dear Bulletin, — How is it that the score of
1238 for 9 wickets, obtained by the Ulster O.C. v. Mac-
quarie 0.C., at Moore Park in 1874, is discarded in all
cricket records? There is not the slightest doubt con-
cerning its genuineness. Some cricketers state that the
reason is on account of the match being only of third-rate
order. But no matter what rank it is, does it not remain
as the record score in any match? —Yours, Kaew.

Harry Dyer, who made 102 for S. A. against
Vic., on Adelaide Oval, is a country player who has been
playing for S. Adelaide Club for two years past, and has a
great record. Dyer is a thin, weak-looking cricketer, but
he hits with tremendous power.
* • * *
One question arises out of the S.A.-Vic. match.
How can Jack Harry be excluded from an Australian
Eleven ? Harry has been performing well for years, and
is the most consistent bat in Vic.
**♦ . ■ *
Iredale’s innings of 81 was greatly admired by
the Englishmen, for Iredale stayed there when the Aus-
tralian’s chance looked blueness itself, and he, with
Giffen, broke the back of the English bowling.
« * * *
The Bulletin deeply regrets that, while under
an unfortunate misapprehension, it should have placed
Humphreys, the English veteran, before the Australian
public in an altogether mistaken light. Humphreys,
it appears, is 45, not 47, years of age, he has but two sons,
whereas this paper credited him with nine, and he owns
in England a very large and eminently successful business.

Richardson is very highly thought of by his
brother Englishmen. Bowling his fastest he can make
the hall turn a foot on the Sydney pitch. His first to
Blackham pitched outside the off-stump and broke clean
across, just missing the leg stump. “Ho!” exclaimed
the Australian captain, thankful for the life. Whiz!
came the second, and the great w icket-keeper was bowled
again, but the timbers stood. Then, feeling that Fate
ordained it, Blackham made 74 without giving a chance.
And not until he had made that 74 did Richardson get the
ball past him for the third time and shatter his wicket.
Such is cricket—and such is luck!

When the Australians started to bat in the big
match enthusiastic brewerToohey offered £lO toevery man
who put up 100 runs, and when George Giffen made 161
he added another £lO for the man who beat George’s
record, and also a third £lO to any man who made 200
runs. Sid. Gregory received £3O, which, with £lO6 10s.
subscribed on the ground, was a nice little sum.
* * * *
London Referee is responsible for the state-
ment that “professional amateurism” in cricket, foot-
ball, &c., was first started by the Australians. “ They
were all mad on cricket. Rivalry between the colonies
was high indeed. Amateurs would not, of course, lake
pay. But the able amateur cricketer found noble induce-
ments to accept some sort of a berth and shift his loca-
tion, or, maybe, he was similarly influenced to remain
where he was. If he could play cricket real well his
ability as a bank-clerk or a Government official, or what
not, was rated far more highly than if he did not possess
that first-named gift.” All of which is true, though it
doesn’t alter the fact that W. G. Grace was spoken
of as a “paid amateur’’—directly or indirectly paid
—several years before Australia developed cricket mad-
ness. Talking of Graces, the elder brother, E.M., was
pitchforked into the billet of county coroner long, long
ago, so that he might be the better able to devote time to
county matches.
♦ * * *
The most objectionable feature of the big
Melbourne Bicycle Meeting was the betting. The
“hoarse-throated” ringmen abounded, and could not be
suppressed. Over a hundred bookmakers were turned
out of the ground, but only to pay another half-crown
and get in again. Oue was taken to the look-up to serve
as a test-case, and Magistrate Panton fined him £5.
With this precedent the M.C.C. holds a weapon which it
intends to wield with effect on future occasions. Mean-
time, the leading cycling authorities show no disposi-
tion to smother the gambling which is threatening to kill
the sport; for a large number of the men, challenged by
the police for shouting the odds, produced in triumph
betting-permits signed by the secretary of the M.B.C. 1
All the scratch men left in the final for the
Austral Wheel Race were obviously handicapped out of a
chance. The little group struggled hard to lessen the
distance that separated it from the main body, but the
effort was futile, and towards the finish they gave up try-
ing. The remarkable thing is that in the heats the
scratch men had no difficulty in overhauling the limit
riders after the third or fourth lap. It is, therefore,
clear that there is a distinct difference in the conditions
of the preliminary arid final heats, and the question
arises : should the competitors left in the final be re-han-
dicapped? There are many arguments in favor. First of
all, the scratch men have to compete against an aggregate
of the best men. This, together with the desire to be
first and not merely amongst the first five, causes the pace
to be swifter, and everything which tends to quicken the
pace is a disadvantage to the scratch men and a corres-
ponding benefit to the other competitors.

Cis Parker, the jockey, was last week carpeted
by the A.J.C. for the misdemeanor of having won a
thousand pound double on the two Cups, Caulfield and
Melbourne. He was let off with a caution not to do it
again, as if any man was likely to spot such a double
twice in a lifetime.
» » * •
The bitter cry of the punter who backed the
Paris and Patron “double,” but didn’t get his money, is
heard in all the highways and byevvays of Smellbourne.
As a rule the defaulting bookmakers scorned to hide
themselves when settling-day arrived. They came up to
the scratch with a careless that they were
stone-broke, and it subsequently transpired that several
of them had been insolvent at the critical moment in
several previous years. This happened to be a year when
a lot of people “struck it,” whereas the “ double "-
finders (who didn’t draw a dividend) in ’93 and ’92 were
so few that the story of their wrongs was not widely
published. “ Laying doubles on the never ” has become
a popular profession down South since the ‘ boom”—
a fact which should bring consolation to many poor
jugginses who nearly pulled off the long odds when
Glenloth or Tarcoola got home. The joy of knowing that
one had a very narrow escape from being swindled is
worth paying ill for. The extra satisfaction of hearing
that a number of luckier punters are now tearing their
hair is thrown in, free of charge.
» • * *
Joe Thompson won over ,£14,000 on the Cam-
bridgeshire. He did not write the name of the winner,
Indian Queen, in any double, and he also backed Tedd v
Hobson’s mare to win outright. His reasons for doing
so, as told in the choicest Thompsonian vernacular,
are most amusing, and would be appreciated by anyone
who is acquainted with the resources of the Australian
language.
« ♦ ♦ ♦
Sculling is played out as a profession. Cham-
pion sculler Stansbury, after having pretty well “done
the globe, vainly inviting people to come on, is now
obliged to look round for some other method of earning a
crust. “No one with any 7 money will row me,” he says.
In America his performances didn’t exceed a few' trifling
exhibitions. He is now settled down on the Parramatta,
where he is principally engaged in growing fat. His row-
ing weight is 12st. 10ib., and his present vast dimensions
are 16 stone.
* * * *
If Steve O’Donnell and Ed. Smith meet in the
States, Smith should win, as he would probably show to >
much “devil” for the scientific Steve. Jim Hall is
anxious for a cut at O Donnell, and, in the writers
opinion, Steve w'ould have a better show with Hall, not-
withstanding the latter’s wonderful science, than with a
rushing fighter like Smith.
Dan Creedon has done himself harm in the
States by not taking his defeat as a man. Creedon’s
statement that Fitzsimmons wins his fights by an unfair
blow with the wrist is bunkum, as to strike such a blow
Fitz would stand a good show of breaking his wrist or
arm. As a matter of fact, he gave Creedon his quietus
with a straight left drive fair in toe teeth.
♦ » » •
The Yankees have not improved the manners or
morals of Australian boxers. Fitzsimmons, an exemplary
husband and father in Australia, has come to grief in the
domestic circle ; Jim Hall is settling down into a saloon
brawler ; Joe Goddard came home with his phenomenal
constitution wrecked ; and if the Yankee papers are to be
believed Dan Creedon, formerly one of the most modest
of boxers, before his Fitzsimmons beating had blossomed
into a “skiter” of the first water. Griffo was beyond
spoiling before he went over. Peter Jackson and George
Dawson appear to be the only two who have preserved
their Australian reputation.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
A Maoriland correspondent writes: “Harry
Laing, the Maori pug., killed whilst attempting to alight
from a moving train some time ago, was the makings of a
splendid fighter. When he fought Paddy Slavin at Wan-
ganui scores of men with no front teeth (the result of
Laing’s playfulness on various occasions) were whooping
for slavin to kill the Maori outright ; but, weak from ill-
ness as Laing was, he held the great P.S. in check for a
considerable time ; and, had he been decently fit, the
Australian would never have progressed further toward
the championship.”

S
“Victor” writes : During the ensuing A. J.O. and
Tatt.’s meetings I would strongly advise speculators to
keep their eyes on M.L.A. and Georgie, who will both be
returned winners. The latter is a very “fast young
lady,” and experienced very hard luck in being beaten at
Rosehill, a fortnight ago.
The acceptances for the big Xmas handicaps are
very fair, and some good fields should be out. The
Summer Cup will bring about 20 to the post, and of my
original six selections I am now left with Tridentate,
The Captain, CElus, and Donation. They are all doing
well on the training track, and for the absolute winner
I shall look to The Captain, with Tridentate as his most
dangerous opponent.
Moorefield, Marvel and Milkmaid (the latter in
the absence of All There) I look on as a very likely trio
for the Carrington Stakes. The first-named is very well
and has made great improvement since he ran second for
this same race last year ; he will win if he is served with
any luck, and I expect to see Marvel run a great horse.
Hirondelle, I know, is fancied by her party, but, flyer
though she is, she cannot give Moorefield 71bs.
I have four left to represent me in Tatt.’s Cup,
viz. : Loyalty, Donation, Tridentate and Warminster.
Should Tridentate escape a penalty he would win, but if
he lands the Summer Cup 1 then expect to see War-
minster and Loyalty fighting it out at the finish.
The Imperial Arcade, which runs from
Pitt to Castlereagh-street, Sydney, midway be-
tween King and Market-street, is one of the most
complete examples of modern architecture in the
city. Completed in 1891 at large cost, its com-
modious arrangements, ample spaces, and hand-
some decorations made it at once a favorite pub-
lic resort. Everything that skill could devise was
done to render it a permanent attraction to visitors.
The provisions for lighting and sanitation, for
fire-prevention and extinction, and for the com-
fort of tenants and the public, are unsurpassed
anywhere. One of the best hotels in Sydney
■ > jcupies the Castlereagh-street front; and the
r mainder is divided into shops and offices which,
in point of situation and convenience, offer almost
unique advantages.
Sydney Wool Sale.
M'Burnby, Wallis and Co. report.—On Monday,
I )th inst., we held a very successful wool sale, the
wretchedly low state of the market considered. Sound
light and free greasy fleece met with competition which
■ilmost reminded the observer of the days when wool
brought reasonable prices, but, unfortunately, buyers
were only eager up to their limits, and consequently late
rates were not actually exceeded. Inferior greasy
fleece, pieces, and bellies still remain at a very low
I vel as compared with a year ago. Scoured wool
shows no inclination towards an increase in value.
We obtained some remarkably high prices for greasy
lambs' wool, which was purchased on American account
and reached up to 7d. per pound. A few prominent clips,
which passed under the hammer at our sale, are the fol-
lowing:—tiM/ADEihONG, from Addons', at6d. per pound;
JO/DILLADERRY, from Temora, at 5Jd. ; 4S/COOLAC,
very carefully got up, at 6Jd. ; AVELEY/JSM, a strong,
light, free wool, from Young, at 6id. for fleece, and sid.
for pieces, and 7d. for lambs ; JSM, in diamond, s|d. for
fleece and 7d. for lambs; WN/Y/New England, a useful
free wool, from Walcha, at 6Jd. for super, comb, and 6d.
for comb. For 51 bales of scoured oddments, very credit-
ably got up by Messrs. Te Kloot and Whan, of Warren, and
branded WC/A, we obtained 7Jd. for pieces, s£d. for S.
pieces, 6Jd. for bellies, for locks, 7Jd. for pieces and
bellies. Our next sale is on Tuesday, 18th inst., when we
will bring forward another attractive catalogue.

“The Anglican Church is as purely English
as if Heaven were only a remote British colony.
It is as inveterabely national as if all the apostles
had been born in London in the Sixteenth Cen-
tury.”
Ed. Bulletin, —N.S.W, G.P.O. allows
mailboys 14s. a week for forage. N.S.W. mili-
tary authorities allow their officers .£6O a year for
the same purpose for each horse, besides rent of
stable. Why this difference of about 11s. per
week? The mailboy’s horse has much the same
appetite as the officer’s, and is worked a good deal
harder.— Gum.
N.S.W. Pharmacy Bill threatens to intro-
duce a new class of trade-unionists. By all means
let the trade in drugs, and the dispensing of medi-
cine, be regulated in the public interest, so that
the business shall be in the hands of competent
persons ; but let the regulation be done by the
State, and, not by any trade-union whatever. It
would be as reasonable to leave the licensing of
public-houses to the L.V. Association.
“ On every ground,” screams Melbourne
Argus, “the country party has a right to put
in its protest (against land taxation) and to
declare for a Budget of economy, of equity, and
of hope.”
r i it’s the sort of thing which should be sung in
■ Ainas pantomimes, instead of bunkum about
lu • goodness of the Royal Family.
Robert Reid, the Victorian softgoods im-
porter —who, being an importer, is naturally also a
Freetrader —points out, as one of the dreadful
results of Protection, that many people have taki n
to drinking Joshua’s brandy—a local production
—instead of using the imported article; and the
result is a serious loss of revenue. Joshua’s
brandy has been declared by European experts to
be of first-class quality ; also, it is much cheaper
than the foreign article; therefore, the only objec-
tion to it is that it is a Victorian product which
supplies employment and wages to Victori; ns
instead of to Europeans. The mental state of the
individual who wants to put down local industiies,
merely because they reduceimports, must be some-
thing unique. By-and-bye it will dawn on Reid
that Australian sheep require to be abolished
because they stop the importation of wool.
The present N.S.W, Assembly, which is
the first one elected under manhood suffrage, is
much more Democratic than the one which pre-
ceded it, yet the direct Labor-party is much
smaller and distinctly less influential than in last
Parliament. The inference is that One-man-one-
vote doesn’t tend to create a Labor-party, which
simply means class representation for the horny-
handed section of the community only ; but rather
to build up a Democratic-party, which represents
the progressive sentiment of the nation at large.
Purely class representation, whether it be for
shearers, lawyers, or importers, is an evil, and
manhood suffrage promises, in time, to make an
end of it.
We are often told by merchants, &c., of
the danger of interfering in the interests of work-
men with the sacred principle of freedom of con-
tract. The Yic. Sale of Goods Bill, which simply
codifies the existing law, provides that a part of a
contract, which the parties declare to be a war-
ranty, i.e., not indispensable, may nevertheless
be held to be indispensable by the Court. But
this is only in the interests of merchants, and
what applies to them can have no analogy with
the case of the common laborer.
Dear Bulletin, —It was refreshing to read
your remarks concerning the “private wealth”
gag, which has been hurled at Australians until
they have got into the habit of thinking them-
selves the richest people on earth. The private
command of ready cash in this country is very
limited. Men have no loose sovereigns lying
about in writing-desks. Wives, as a rule, can’t
pay an unexpected bill at first sight. Rents are
collected weekly ; the gas account comes in once a
month, instead of once a quarter. Money is scarce
among the many, and millionaires are few.—F.
Dear Bulletin, Grant Allen’s new
hedonism is only the same old floundering round
the gratuitous assumptions that the universe
pivots on man, and that what he calls “ wrong ”
isn’t as essential a part of the scheme of things as
what he calls “right.” There is absolutely
nothing to show that “race-elevation” is any
more normal than “race-degradation,” or that the
perpetuation of the human is of any greater cos-
mic importance than the perpetuation of the
oyster. “Evil” —from the man-fly’s point of
vi ew —ig whatever tends to brush him off the
wheel of Nature. But the wheel doesn’t care.
—Heretic.

When yearly deficits are swelling
The size of our national debt,
Instead of persistently dwelling
On payments that have to be met,
A Treasurer ought to start washing
His hands with invisible soap.
And rise in his place, with a jubilant face.
To give us a Budget of Hope—
’Ope, ’ope—
A nice little Budget of Hope.
A truce to this taxing and croaking,
And give the “ poor farmer ” a chance ;
Depression’s a matter for joking—
Let’s call on the Chair for a dance.
We want a gay johnnie like Carter :
Witli trouble he’s able to cope,
Though ids figures were wrong, as we knew all along,
He gave us a Budget of Hope—
’Ope, ’ope—
A nice little Budget of Hope.
Hooroo for the banks and the squatters
Who work for the good of the land,
These Radical members are “ rotters
A beastly, burglarious band.

Why cannot lie chuck it, and “slope,”
if he doesn't intend to behave like a friend
And give us a Budget of Hope—
’Ope, ’ope—
And trive us a Budget of Hope.

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
t, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr

sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfa line Fills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than

“This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
“It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-

The smashed portion of the Melb. Falls
Bridge, to which attention was drawn in The
Bulletin two years back, has remained un-
repaired for four years past, or ever since the
accident occurred. There is simply a row of hurdles
chained round the opening to keep drunks from
falling in. Melbourne is hard-up.
The Melb. Society for the Assistance ot
Persons of Education reports, with a glow, having
done noble work. This society differs from the
cold-blooded charity-organisation gang, inasmuch
as where the latter “inquires” the former “ex-
amines.” The S. for A. of P. of E., when asked
for a soup-ticket or a pair of cast-off pants,
requires the applicant to translate a slab of
Horace and do a compound proportion sum in
decimals.
You could not sell a tomahawk or axe with
a gold-painted head, no matter how good or cheap,
in any of the New Hebrides group. Black-painted
heads are the only saleable sort. Once a German
dealer did a great business trip with the gilded
sort, selling cheap, of course ; but after the axes
had been in use a day or two the steel tipping fell
off and left a useless soft-metal tool. Had this
dealer not got away quickly, he would have had
the real article (thrown from somewhere in the
rear with the deadly overarm whirl) in his skull.
Droving-story by M , a well-known
Queenslander : “I was coming down with a mob
of 1500 cattle, in a big drought, and got into a
fearfully dry country. The beasts hadn’t had a
drink for five days, and I was riding ahead won-
dering what was going to be the end of it all when
I came upon a huge bottle-tree, at which I pulled
up, for it struck me that there was enough water
in that tree to save my mob if I could only get at
it. I went to camp, got an auger and came back
with two men and we rigged up troughs and
tapped the tree and watered the whole 1500, with
lots to spare. You fellows mightn’t believe it,
but Sam there can tell you it’s true.” “True as
Gospel,” said Sam, “ for I came past there six
weeks afterwards and caught a cod-fish.”
A (let us say Queensland) “financier”
combined business with pleasure the other day.
(Jailed on a storekeeper, who was “ behind,” and
graciously informed him that he intended writting
him when he got back to town. Next day the
usurer hired a boat and fisherman for a few hours,
for a price which was to include all the fish cap-
tured. The financier probably did not know that
the fisherman was the debtor’s son-in-law, but it is
quite certain that when the boat was on the fish-
ing-ground the fisherman unfortunately opened
the boat’s bung-hole, lost the peg overboard (so he
said), and, whilst sitting on the orifice to keep
the water out, asked Abraham what he would
give for the life-belt which he (the fisherman) had
under his jersey. There being a corner in life-
belts just then, and bung-hole-stoppers having
risen to a fabulous price, a sum—in notes —passed,
which enabled the fisherman to find another peg
to stop the leak and to put by a tidy sum, after
“ landing ” Abraham in both ways, and taking
up the overdue bill of his father-in-law.

Dear Bulletin, — While you are on the
subject of “Colonial ” slang or colloquialisms, why
not get your correspondents to supply original
expressions with, as far as possible, derivations?
I3y-and-bye many words that are now slang will
drift into colloquialisms, to be later assimilated
by the great Australian language. If we are going
to be, a nation we are going to develope a lan-
guage, and it’s never too soon to commence col-
lecting philological data which to-day are new
and to-morrow are forgotten. Some examples :
“Hung up”: Mining expression derived from practice
of hanging-up the stampers of a battery when idle.
Meaning, work suspended.
“Larrikin”: From thieves' patter, lerrya, thief; kin, young
—this despite the plausible Sergeant Dalton yarn.
“ Leary cove ” is one who knows all about the
business of stealing and disposing of stolen goods.
“Gone bung”: Financially dead—from aboriginal
“ bong,” dead—as in bilfabong, literally dead-water,
applied to back-water.
“ Gibba ” : A stone (aboriginal).
“Rye-buck”: “All right,” “ It’s a bargain "—from
Hebrew “ reivoch,” a bargain.
“Bart" [ Sydney larrikinese. Derivation?
The future language of Australia will have a strong
tincture of “Yiddish,” from the freedom with
which the argot is used by the bookie crowd and
absorbed and distributed by the stable and race-
course habitues, say 9-10ths of the population.—

DO THOU LIKEWISE.
When one sets a candle in a window on a dark
night he never can tell how many lost and be-
wildered travellers it may guide on their way.
I once knew a dear lady who habitually did it
on every dark night. The road that passed her
house was always forsaken and lonesome enough,
and houses were far apart. So, on the general
principle of goodwill to men, she placed her
candle in a sort of projecting window, where it
would shine both ways and do the most good.
She is dead and gone now, but let us hope that
her family keeps up the custom. To be sure, it
brought her many a strange guest, yet she did
what she could for them, and never grumbled—
pay or no pay.
A year or two ago a little book was printed,
containing an account, by Mr. John Hodson, of
Warboys, Hunts, of the way he was cured of a
wasting disease _ by Mother Seigel’s Curative
byrup—a complaint contracted in India, where
Mr. Hodson was once a soldier in the British
Army.
This candle of Hodson’s beamed hopefully in
all directions, and, among others, its rays fell
upon the eyes of a woman who needed light at
that particular time. How it came to pass she
tells m a letter, from which we quote the follow-
ing :
“ I was,” she says, “always healthy up to
May, 1884, when I had an attack of gastric
fever, which left me low and feeble. I had a
bad taste in the mouth, and after everything I
ate I had great pain in the chest and sides, and
also dreadful pain at the back and between the
shoulder-blades, and a sinking feeling at the pit
of the stomach. My legs trembled and shook
under me, so I could not walk out. Indeed, it
was as much as I could do to get across the
floor. A dry, hacking cough set in and shook
me very much, and I lost a deal of sleep.
“ As I grew weaker I was confined to my bed
more and more, and my daughter was obliged to
take my place in doing the housework. A doctor
attended me for over a year. He tried first one
kind of medicine and then another, but none of
them helped me. At the end of the year the
doctor said he could do no more for me, and
recommended me, as a last resort, to try a change
of air.
“I had got a despair of ever getting better
when a book was sent to me full of statements
from different people, telling how they had been
made well of various complaints by using Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and I read of a young
man living at Warboys, near me, having been
cured in a marvellous manner by this medicine.
I got a bottle from Messrs. Palmer and Sons,
chemists, Ramsey, and, after I had taken it a
week, I felt relief and gained strength. All my
vain left me, and I have never looked behind me
since. I take an occasional dose of the Syrup
and keep in excellent health. I give you full
permission to use this letter as you think fit.
Yours truly, (signed) Sarah Mason, Ramsey
Heights, Ramsey, Hunts, January 27th, 1892.”
What better use could we possibly put this
lady’s letter to than to publish it ? In this way
it has fallen into the present reader’s hands, and
may turn out to be a candle in the window to
show him refuge and shelter beside some long and
gloomy path. A word more on this very point.
It is not a matter of choice whether we are to
help one another. We are obliged and bound to do
so by every consideration of morality and utility.
Humanity is like the body of one man : if a single
part is neglected, the rest must pay the penalty.
Therefore, set candles in windows. If, for
instance, Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup has
done you good, say so, publish it, make it known.
Others near you may be groping in darkness.
And it is all the more a subject of rejoicing that
this remedy, as in the above case, conquers indi-
gestion and dyspepsia, because that complaint it
is which clouds the sun for millions on Life’s
hard road.

A Bundaberg (Q.) farmer recently took a
rope and started into the bush leading his aged
father along with him. When he reached the
f big tree he climbed to a top branch, uttered a
shrill whoop or two, and hanged himself. Mean-
while, the poor father, who was too old for tree-
climbing, was alternately delivering impassioned
addresses to the suicide, and clawing with his
withered hands at the trunk in vain efforts to
ascend.
Dear Bulletin, —Yet another tight place.
J riend of mine, in white suit, while crossing pad-
dock near homestead on scorching hut day, was
chased by a bull. He shinned up a tree, mean-
ing to stay until the brute went away, or some of
the hands came in sight. Bull showed no inclina-
tion to leave, and the climber began to get
cramped. A hive of bees had swarmed at home-
stead, and were making for his tree, his white
apparel inviting them to settle on him. They
buzzed round him and (he couldn’t move one way
or the other) he tried to “shoo” them off, but
they only stung him on the face the more. His
ones for help excited the bull, who bellowed his
loudest, and he was just thinking whether it would
not, be better to slide down and trust to the mercy
of the beast when help came.—S.
When the wrecked Wairarapa lurched over
on her side a, passenger named Chamberlain—
according to his evidence afterwards given at the
inquest—was crawling forward with some others
on the outside of the ship. “ By-and-bye an old

When I saw him I said ‘ Hulloa, Whaley !’ He
replied ‘Hulloa, old man; it’s ago with us this
time!’ ‘Oh, I don’t know, old chap,’l said:
keep your pecker up. You never know till the
numbers are up. ’ Shortly after that a big wave
came along, and the pessimist was taken, while
the optimist was left. Probably the optimist, by
reason of his creed, hung on the tighter of the
two.

Dear Bulletin, here’s an enquiry
Which puzzles me quite:
Why poets of spirit so fiery,
Who both live and write,
Whose mind is a web of fine tissue—
Men like Gordon and Boake (both, we miss you!),
“ The Banjo,” whose note still may issue
Our sense to delight—
Persist beyond measure in sighing.
Why brood in such sadness ?
No-one for a moment’s denying
That life has its badness;
But wail not, ye gifted, who can sing,
In long lamentations enhancing
Life’s manifold woes, without glancing
At all its great gladness.
Such plaints give but half of our life-song,
The whole why not tell ?
You know the bright tabor-and-fife-song,
Nb less than the knell.
Let the songs of our land be as cheerful
As life is : our sons are not fearful;
In ill-luck too brave to be tearful:
Hymn that side as well!

The Ballad of Stuttering
Tim,
(ILLUSTRATING THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This is the yarn of Stuttering Jim, the girl, and
the other man,
The strangest yarn that ever was told since ever
the world began;
The yarn that was told by Stuttering Jim when
the hour of the dawn was nigh,
And the fire grew dim, and the pipes went out,
and the whisky-bottle was dry.
There are tales that are told in the darkness, and
tales that are told in the light,
And some are fit for the morning star, and some
for the secret night;
But the tale that he told is the tale to tell when
the camp-fire’s wan and grey,
And the dawn breaks into the house of night with
the blood-red hammers of day.
Now, Jim was a man of thirty-two, though he
looked a good three-score,
For his back was bent, and his eyes were red, and
the hue of his hair was hoar.
There was me, and Pell, and Carroty Joe, and
Barney and Bandy Gray,
But never a word came out of the crowd as he
gave himself away.
And Jim he talked as he mostly did when the
whisky slipped his tongue,
Of the time when his back was straight and
strong, and his looks, like his years, were
young,
And he whined of a day when his tongue could
wag as fast as a man would think,
When his eyes were bright, and all was well,
before he took to the drink.
And he talked of a girl that lived hard by to a
place that he had of his own,
With a face like the flower that glows in the bush
when the winter is one-half flown.
She could ride all day, and dance all night, and
be up with the morning dew,
And milk the cows on her father’s farm, as a
well-bred girl should do.
And though she loved dancing and dainty things,
as a healthy maiden must,
There was never a man of the sons of men could
have brought her head to the dust;
But she and Jim got talking of love, which is
dangerous talk for a man,
And the end of it was they plighted their troth —
and then the trouble began.
For there came a chap to her father’s farm, a bit
of a ne’er-do-well,
Who had gone the pace for all it was worth till
they shipped him away to hell.
And he got struck on this girl of Jim’s till his
blood was all of a flame,
And he pushed old Jim for the foremost place like
a man that was used to the game.
And Jim got riled, and chopped about, for he saw
how the current blew,
And now he was mad, and now he was gay, and
he kept the girl in a stew.
But the girl stuck fast to her plighted troth, and
treated it all as a jest—
She clung as the steel wedge clings to the wood,
but she liked the other chap best.
And Jim he told how the girl’s old man, and her
mother, and all the three
Went up one day to the Forty-mile Bush on a
sort of a picnic spree.
And Jim and the girl got wandering off, as a man
and. a maid will do,
And the place was supple-jack up to the eyes, and
as flat as a cake all through.
And there’s some that go and twist and turn and
come out safe and sound,
And there’s some that gt>, and never come back,
for they leave their bones on the ground.
And there’s dandy bushes this side of hell for a
man that is sick of the play,
But the dandiest bush in all that land is the bush
that they found that day.
Then the old man up and off to the farm, for he
said that he trusted Jim
To bring his girl by another road home, for noth-
ing would happen to him.
But the English chap hung a bit behind, and he
crammed his pockets with food,
And the very first chance the beggar saw he was
off and away for the wood.
Then Jim he told how he and the girl had tangled
the bush about,
And how, by dark, the other man came to show
them a pathway out;
But what should a Londoner know of the bush
more than they who are native-born ?
He led them the way that leads to death betwixt
the night and the morn.
For the bush was as thick as a paddock of maize,
and sharp as a tiger’s claw,
With the supple-jack vines, and the saws and
spines of toi and tatara-moa.
But still he thought they’d a kind of show if only
the food would last,
And he parted some bread ’twixt Jim and the girl,
but he shut his own mouth for a fast.
And another day went, and another day came,
and a day and a night thereto,
And they came to a bit of a rise at last where a
peep of the sky got through,
And they lighted a fire of leaves and logs, and
settled them down to wait
Till the rescue came. And the days and nights
went past till they numbered eight.
Their food was done on the sixth day out, though
they rationed it down to a crumb,
And their water was most of it slime from the
swamp, and the flesh of the taraire plum ; _
And the suns that rose and the suns that set
looked down in their giddy whirl
On the English beggar that kept his fast for the
love of a starving girl.
And he and the girl were weak as rats, and
twisted with deadly pain,
And pale as the tea-tree flower that blows at the
end of the winter rain.
But Jim hung out from day to day, with a face
of steady cheer,
Till the Englishman woke from a bit of a doze,
and he reckoned the thing looked queer.
So he followed Jim down to the edge of the
swamp, though the beggar could barely stand,
And he spied him there, like a rat in a hole, with
a crust of bread in his hand.
Eor Jim had found the stuff in the pouch ere the
sixth dawn grew to day,
And he thought of his love, and he thought of his
faith, but life seemed better than they.
For life is life, and death is death, and each man
“ goes alone,”
And death is a frozen No Man’s Land, and life is
a torrid zone;
And the way of the world is a curious way, and
curious creatures thrive,
And the false man lives and the true man dies,
and only the fit survive.
Then the English chap stepped out of his lair, and
they stood by the swamp alone,
And he saw Jim bury the crust in the fern, as a
dog will bury a bone,
And he cried : “I have given my life for yours, if
ever this world goes round,
But I’ll win her love for a dying man in lieu of a
living hound.
“ I have tortured my flesh for twelve long days to
give her the joy of life,
But now she is mine for the rest of time, and the
devil may find you a wife.
I have gambled and sworn and lied and mocked
and humbled myself to none,
But I’m more of a man with all my sins than
you with your single one.
“ I have drunken and danced and had my fling,
and laughed at the “ Promise of May,’’
But not for all that God has to give would I stand
in your shoes to-day.”
And he up and off where the young girl sat, with
her eyes fixed hard on the sod,
And he said ; “It is better to know to-day than
to learn to-morrow from God.
“ You’ve set your heart on the form of a man, but
he’d never the soul of a hound,
And it’s better to die with the truth all told than
go with a lie to the ground.”
And he told the tale with a fainting voice, and a
face like a winding-sheet,
And bade her God-speed, and clutched his throat,
and dropped down dead at her feet.
Then Jim he told how he slunk from the swamp,
for he dreaded to die alone,
And he saw the girl where she sat by her dead,
with her face set still as a stone ;
And the girl looked up from the eyes of the corpse
with their blank and ghastly stare,
And she looked at the live and she looked at the
dead, and the dead face seemed more fair.
And she smiled and sighed, and put out her arms
and gathered the corpse to her breast,
And she said : “ You have had my plighted troth,
but I loved the dead man best.
And I fear he played us false with the food, or
how should it come to pass
That a strong man, Tull of the lust of life, should
die in the arms of a lass ?
“You’ll come safe out from the gates of death
while the fiend has work to do,
And you’ll find a mate in the warm, full world,
but I’m not the girl for you.
The love you gave was a dainty thing as the hue
of a sunset sky.
But the love of the dead was the love of a man,
for it taught him the way to die.”
And the day went down and the day came up, and
a long cold night thereto,
And then the rescue broke through the woods, as
rescues mostly do.
For twelve long days they had followed the trail
where hardly a bird could dive,
And they carried two corpses out of the bush, but
Jim they carried alive.
There are tales that are told in the darkness, and
tales that are told in the light,
And some are fit for the morning star, and some
for the secret night;
But the tale Jim told is the tale to tell when the
camp fire’s wan and grey,
And the dawn breaks into the house of night with
the blood-red hammers of day.

“ It should be the aim of every man to
leave enough money behind him to set up his
wife’s second husband in business.”
“It is proper for a man to wait until the
lady sits down before seating himself, that is il
there is more than one chair in the room.”
A Sydney tobacco firm offered an M.L.A.
£5 to introduce into an address in the Legislative
Assembly the name of a particular brand of weed.
Which proves that the enterprising party doesn’t
know everything, as it is certain that, if such an
allusion were made, the name of the brand would
be excluded from the press reports. The incident,
however, suggests one danger against which a
popularised daily Hansard would need to guard.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I didn’t care to drink alone, so asked the young
fellow to join me.
He was out of work, he said ; out of gaol also —
the latter, apparently, a new experience.
“F’r, y’see it’s this way, boss, w’en the Weedin’
cops gets ter know a bloke, ’n ’ave ’im through
their ’ands wunst er twice, they alwus pick ’im up
wenever they want ter make a case, ’n as ’e’s
alwus ‘well known,’ ’e’s bound ter go inter the
nick. Carn’t live ’onest if ’e wanted ter.
“ I ain’t goin’ in no more, not if I can ’elp it.
“ Last I gob was two stretch for toppin’ a bloke
orf wid an ’arf-a-brick, ’n bootin’ ’im round a bib.
I did it right enough, too—’n I’d do it agen if ’e
served me the same way, if I ’ad to get a nother
twenty-five.”
“ What? were you flogged?”
“ Wasn’t I! Put yer ’and up ’ere under me
bloomin’ coat ’n y’ll feel,
“Yes. I took five-’n-twenty of ’em like a toff —
but never no more —not me.”
“Hurt?”
“ Did y’ ever get a cub wid a w’ip when y’ was
a kid ?”
“Yes.”
“ Madey’ jump? ”
“ Rather.”
“ Well, w’en y’r tied up f’r a floggin’ y’ carn’t
jump. See? Well, if y’ can fancy nine w’ips
cornin’ down at wunst, ’n’ fancy wantin’ ter jump,
’n’ carn’b, y’ get a kinda idea.
“ W’en I was took out f’r my bit o’ lacin’ I felt
jes’ like I felt wunst w’en I got a punch over the
’art in a boxin’ room. I’ve ’erd of a bloke’s ’art
goin’ inter ’is Weedin’ boots, but, by , I thorb
myen ’ad gone out through the bloomin’ lace ’oles.
“ I was tied up by a bull of a bloke, ’oo strapped
me ’ands so ’igh me feet was jes’ tippin’ the
ground. Then ’e straps me arms, ’n thighs, ’n
knees, 'n ankles, ’n gives me me shirt to chew
between the strokes.
“ Then ’e sheds ’is coat, ’n claws ’is set o’ boot-
laces, ’n then ’e swings em round ’n down they
comes.
“I thorb ’e’d ’it me in the belly. I didn’t feel
the pain on me back, at the first one, but in me
stomach, ’n there I felt ’s if all me inside was
cornin’ up inter me neck.
“ It seemed’s if it was a arf a nour before I got
the next one, ’n by then me bloomin’ back begun
to tingle, ’n I felt like’s if fifty devils was jabbin’
me with five million red-’ot needles. Then I ’erd
the swish of the lash ’n got the second. I knew
jes’ w’ere I was ’it that time, ’n I chewed a chunk
outer me shirt so’s I wouldn’t yell.
“ There was a mob o’ people there—reporters, I
s’pose, ’n I didn’t want to squeak. None o’ them
coves can ever write about a floggin’ till they’ve
’ad one, ’n ’ere’s a cove ’ud like to give ’em a taste
o’ pussy’s tail all round f’r nixey. Wot do they
wanter come ’n see a poor devil chopped up f’r?
“ Funny thing, ain’t it? I never felt any more
after that in the way o’ pain till I was finished
wid. Not till I’d bin in the orsepital f’r a nour er
so. Then I was put through all right. Couldn’t
sleep n’r eat—only drink all that night, ’n’ nex’
day couldn’t ’ardly move, ’n’ wen the cuts was
’eelin’ up I felt like me skin was too tight f’r me
back, ’n’ I waa lightened ter stoop down f’r fear
I’d bust it.
“ By-’m’-by X got all right, n’ now I don’t teel
nothin*. Never have to scratch my back though,
now.”
“Why?”
“ Couldn’t feel nothin’ there—it’s like leather.
“ I don’t want ter go back ter the nick, but if I
ever get a charnce ter ’ave a crack at that bloke
wot flailed me, by the livin’ I’ll crack ’is skull
like a rotten goose egg—the dog.
“ I stoushed the bloke w’en I was in a tearin’
temper—bub ’e goes ’n chops chaps up in cold
blood. ’E’s a bigger brute than the coves ’e
cuts up.
“ Nex’ time I wanter top a joker off I’ll lay f’r
’im till ’e’s by ’is bleedin’ self.
“ No more twenty-fives f’r me.
“ There’s more days than one ter deal wid a
bloke wot narks y’.”

Historian Gibbon’s centenary was cele-
brated in London, Nov. 15. The idea of remem-
bering the man who formulated the most crushing
indictment ever written against the saints and
martyrs of primitive Christianity would have been
regarded with horror in England only 50 years
ago ; and the fact that nob even the religious press
has now a stone to throw at Gibbon’s memory is
another proof of the disrepute into which theo-
logical dogma has fallen since his time.
Dear Bulletin, —Another “tight place.”
Just before the boom on Hill End, I was doing a
night-shift in the Western Undaunted. She was
down some 300 feet, working with a whim; and
centred within 20 or 30 feet of the surface, sinking
straight to out the famous golden veins of Brown’s,
Porter’s, and Hurley’s. I had for a mate Harry
O (father of a well-known bookie, who, by the
by, was working in the same shaft). We fired a
couple of holes and had crib. When I started to
go below, it was blowing and raining so hard that
you couldn’t keep a candle alight—so, standing on
the edge of the heavy iron bucket, I gave the
word, “Lower away below the centreing and stop”
—so that I could get a light. Down, down in the
darkness; a sudden bump, and I am jammed
against the southern end of the shaft. The
bucket has caught the centreing. Down goes the
rope past me, its weight increasing the jam. A
thousand thoughts flash through ray brain in an
instant. The weight of the rope must drag the
bucket down; I determine to hold on to the rope if
the bucket goes—bub what a smash if I miss!
The rope stops ; I shout, “ Heave up ! heave up !”
The rope quickly ascends; lam in dread that it
may unship the bucket, so prepare for a desperate
grip. With the rattle of the shackle and chain
attached to the bucket —how Ido grip ! “ What’s
up? What’s wrong?” is the question as I arrive
on the edge of the bucket at the landing. “ Oh,
nothing; just caught napping, that’s all. Lower
away right to the bottom this time, Billy.”—
Yours, Jbronq.

In 1861 Edward Stringer discovered gold at (Stringer’s
Creek) the foot of Long Tunnel Hill, Walhalla. The reef
now worked by the various Long Tunnel companies was
afterwards owned by Cohen, a Wulhalla auctioneer and
agent, and is called Cohen’s Reef. Stringer died desti-
tute.
Cohen ! Cohen !
Stringer skimmed the cream at Ballarat, at Fryer’s
and Sandy Stone;
Stringer walked from Woods’ Point east’ard every
blessed inch alone;
Stringer climbed Walhalla’s ranges when the
mountain winds were blowin’,
But when auctioneers and such came Stringer
thought he’d best be goin’—
Cohen! Cohen 1
Cohen! Cohen!
Stringer forced the safe of Nature ; Stringer burst
her bolts and bars ;
Miners work to find the metal and their work the
Cohen mars.
Oh, the mighty clan of Cohen ! To their hands
for ever flowin’
Come the stolen meeds of labor, earned by sweat
—annexed by law,
By the toil-less syndicator of the large insatiate
maw;
To that race which tots the rows up of the other
fellow’s hoein’—
Cohen! Cohen !
Cohen! Cohen !
Stringer walked to wild Walhalla —Cohen drove
there with a coach.
Cohen got the reef, although he later made his
first approach,
Cohen learned to oast up figures—Cohen knew
that he who stays
Office-scheming while the other fellow works shall
end his days
Fat and rich and known, and knowin’, with the
world’s wealth to him flowin’,
He who made that wealth by sweating to a
pauper’s grave is goin’—
Cohen! Cohen!
Cohen ! Cohen !
Fate’s an auctioneer that takes your nod and
passes other bids,
Makes the Gentiles sweat the sweating—makes
the sweaters of the Yids ;
Gives to Stringer burial squalid—gives to Ike the
monument
Made of brass, and Jewry-figured—paid by inter-
est shent per shent.
For while labor wears its brain-pan in the sinews
of the arms,
The scheming drone shall own the earth —its
mining and its farms.
To starvation Labor’s goin’—unto wealth pro-
gresses Cohen,
And it isn’t far from Cohen until Stringer’s really
gone ;
For whatever labor’s doin’, still the coin to
Cohen’s flowin’.
The commission-agent’s mowin’ down the stringers
—flesh and bone,
An’ the syndicators, knowin’, stow the spoil and
don’t stop stowin’
Till the lab’rer’s got past Oohen—till his chance
rests on the “ Cohen ”
For a moment, and is—“ Cohn.”

Dear Bulletin, —Re capital punishment.
The other day I found a half-grown diamond spar-
row on our verandah. I restored it to what
seemed its native nest; but must have placed it
amongst a hostile community, as next morning I
found it dead—suspended by a long hair from the
edge of the nest. —H,, Wilcannia, 16th Nov.
The stand taken by Labor-members in Q.
Parliament on the innocent-looking Land Pur-
chase Bill merely amounts to a demand that pur-
chases shall be made subject to the sanction of
Parliament. Ministers declare they will sacrifice
the Bill rather than take such an amendment.
It would be well for Australia if in every Parlia-
ment members made a similar stand to have land
purchases negotiated by Minister, subject to the
“santion of Parliament.”
According to the absentee clause in N.S. W.
Land-tax Bill, “ any owner of land in New South
Wales who shall not have resided within the
colony for a period equal to four years in every
period of six years immediately preceding the
year of assessment shall pay tax on an additional
20 per centum,” &c. Under this clumsily-drafted
clause a man who came to New South Wales three
years ago, and bought land, and settled down to
spend the rest of his life in the province, would
be taxable as an absentee, because he hadn’t been
in the country for four years out of the last six.
The Land-tax Bill was evidently drafted by a
lawyer.
Mining man pulls up very late at country
pub, and demands a bed. “ Haven’t a room to
spare in the house,” replies the landlord ; “show’s
on just now.” “Bub I must sleep somewhere,
and I’m going to.” “ Well, there’s a spare bed in
the billiard-room, but a lady’s in the other there.
Still, if you’ll go in in the dark and get out early
to-morrow morning when the boobs sneaks in to
call you, you can have it. Bub be quiet, and don’t
say a word to anyone.” Manganese assented, and
the position of the couch having been whisperingly
pointed out, he retired to roost. Ten minutes
later he burst into the bar, with his hair on end.
“My God!” he cried to the landlord, “that
woman’s dead!” “Yes,” blandly replied Mr.
Snakejuice; “ but how did you find out ?”

The works of a watch are its
chief essential. The works of
the Apex watch equal in all
regards those of high-class silver
and gold watches costing from
£7 to £l5.
The untarnishable case of the
Apex Watch is of nickel,
beautifully engine- turned, with
star and garter. No more elegant
or compact watch can be bought
for money.
The Apex Watch is a keyless
short-winder ; ten turns wind it
for 24 hours. The keyless work
is extra strong, with safety barrel.
The watch is thoroughly regu-
lated and timed for immediate
use, and will last as long, with
even the roughest wear, as any
watch for which you pay 20 times
the money.

“Every man can write at least one book,” every
man with brains has at least one good story to
tell; every man with or without brains moves in
a different circle and knows things unknown to
any other man. Write carefully and plainly on
one side of the paper only, obliterating every un-
necessary word; then mail your work to The
Bulletin, which pays for accepted matter. In
certain of the so-called prize-competitions the
great prizes fall to the newspaper-proprietor, who
gets the guileless public to work for him for noth-
ing. Short stories, or ballads, especially on hush,
mining, sporting, social, or dramatic themes, are
preferred by The Bulletin ; 1360 words go to a
column. If you can possibly keep your story
within a column all the better Don’t write a
column on any subject if a half-column will do ;
don’t write half-a-ooluran where a mere paragraph
is enough. “ Boil it down.”
