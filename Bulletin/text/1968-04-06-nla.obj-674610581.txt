Panelift door in gold & off-white Colorbond.
It’s cheaper and
better that way.
Lysaght Colorbond provides
manufacturers with a new concept
in steel sheet and coil. Paint first.
Fabricate later.
Colorbond is a premium quality,
factory applied coating onto cold
rolled or zinc coated sheet steel.
No conventional spray or dip process
could ever match its uniformity and
finish at a lower cost.' Paint and
labour costs alone could be greater.
Colorbond is versatile. It can be deep
drawn, roll formed, stamped, press
braked or hot stamped. The result,
a more attractive product at a lower
cost. A great idea. Use Colorbond
to supplement your own finishing
facilities. Or to raise out-put without
further capital outlay. Colorbond
can save dollars all down the line.
Find out more about how Colorbond
can save you money and improve
your product. Technical advice and

Eight dollars fifty
could save your
life one dark
night.
Last year 12 people died and 353 were
injured because car drivers were
dazzled by the lights of oncoming
cars.
Sunoroid have done something
about it.
They’ve introduced a new sort of
Night Driving Glasses. The lenses are vacuum
coated and have an exclusive anti-reflection tint. They cut out
the glare and dazzle of oncoming headlights and increase visibility.
Instead of seeing just lights coming at you, you see the road ahead. They even work in
the rain. Or on those dull, wet days when light bounces off everything.
See your chemist for Sunoroid “Le Mans’.’ Night Driving Glasses. They come in a special
case you can clip to the sun visor of your car. If you wear spectacles when you drive,
Sunoroid can vacuum coat your prescription lenses and provide them with the same anti-
reflection tint. Don’t be afraid of the dark.
Keep a pair of Sunoroid Night Driving Glasses in your car.

CHANGING IDEAS
IF THINGS keep on the way they
are, 1974 should be the year that Aus-
tralia becomes a republic. According
to Gallup Poll figures, in 1966 28 per-
cent of those asked “Do you think we
should continue our present ties with
Britain, or should we become an entirely
separate republic?” thought we should
become a republic: in 1968 the figure
was 40 percent. According to our sums,
by 1974 it should be 100 percent.
NO DEMAND
VICTORIA is keeping up its splendid
censorship record. Forty-two publica-
tions “approved” by the Commonwealth
censor are still classed as obscene in
Victoria.
The “Book Sale of the Century” was
held in Bourke Street last week. These
were on sale: “Lolita,” 50c, “The
American Dream,” 95c., “Lady Chat-
terley’s 1 Lover,” 40c, “Love Me,
Sailor,” 70c, and “Another Country,”
70c.
These books had this in common:
all were in hard covers and all, until
recently, were banned in Victoria. They
have now reached the bottom of the
remainder heap, which seems to in-
dicate that the public is not as prurient
as either the censors believe or opti-
mistic booksellers hope.
BACK TO SCHOOL
PARENTS have to work harder than
ever to bridge the generation gap now
that the new maths holds sway in the
classrooms. A child doesn’t do sums any
more—he “understands and interprets
his environment” with a new language
made up of things called sets,
algorisms, open sentences, topology,
and so on, which is all very bewilder-
ing to someone who still has difficulty
adding up the grocery bill.
But some of the schools have taken
pity on parents alarmed at the sudden
gaping gaps in “meaningful communi-
cation” between them and their chil-
dren by arranging evening classes in
the new maths.
We went along to one public school
in the rarefied reaches of Sydney’s
North Shore, where the new maths is
just one item on a program of evening
classes running the gamut from art
and dressmaking to French and yoga.
Despite this kind of competition there
are two classes a week in the new
maths, and at the one we attended
there were 20 people, all reduced to a
common denominator by the fact that
they were occupying desks built to
accommodate their offspring.
Things began gradually. The teacher,
Mr. Webb, tinkered with repeating
decimals, made a few throwaway refer-
ences to infinity, and demonstrated the
ease of metric measures. At this point,
the class, now in its eighth week, was
looking rather bored, unless somebody
managed to catch Mr. Webb out in an
error of addition or subtraction, and he
himself apologised for the fact that
they were probably finding “these
initial mundane things” very small beer
indeed.
He then enlivened proceedings by
distributing roneoed sheets headed
number patterns. These announced
their own intentions—“to provide op-
portunities for children to explore and
discover number relationships . . . en-
courage children to pose questions of
their own ... increase interest and
lead to deeper appreciation of mathe-
matics.”
Mr. W’ebb added that we could all
let our imagination run loose with the
problems on this sheet, which was
clearly what everybody had been wait-
ing for, judging from the renewal of
interest. We were asked to add 52 and
25, subtract 25 from 52, compare the
results, and treat other reverse digits in
the same way, all the time searching for
relationships between the results. The
discussion then started moving at a
bewildering rate. A man at the back
came-up with the intelligence that the
addition results were always divisible
by 11, the subtraction results divisible
by nine.
In most schools, the evening classes
have started as a result of requests
from Parents and Citizens’ Associations,
or because a headmaster felt parents
were sufficiently interested. And, ac-
cording to Mr. Webb, most parents
are finding their return to the class-
room less traumatic than one might
expect.
TWO OF A KIND
THE REVUE presented by Frank
Lazarus and Maggie Soboil at the
Adelaide and Perth Festivals was an
acknowledged success. They will shortly
Frank Lazarus ... implicit values
open in Sydney next month, and from
there will eventually go on to other
States and New Zealand. We visited
them after their late-night show at
Adelaide’s Theatre 62. It was about
2 a.m. when we walked across to the
theatre’s deserted coffee lounge. They
were in their “Hello Macbeth” cos-
tumes, straightforward enough with
square-headed Frank, but with Maggie
it meant talking to an attractive blonde
druid.
Crumpets and coffee arrived, and
while Maggie was engrossed in these,
Frank said he was the son of a Cape
Town wine merchant “but I know noth-
ing about wines.” He graduated in Law
from the University of Cape Town, and
“the day after I was admitted to the
side-bar, I enrolled as a student of
drama at the university. I was not cut
out to be a solicitor.”
Maggie, some years younger than
Frank, was educated at a Cape Town
convent, and after a abroad and
some years teaching she also joined
the University Drama School. Her
grandfather three-times removed was a
Marshal in Napoleon’s army, who, after
being trapped in Prussia, made his way
to America, whence her immediate an-
cestors came to South Africa. She
added quickly: “But I’ve an Australian
grandfather, too, and so has Frank.
We’re really a part of this place. And

anyhow, Australia’s very like South
Africa in both obvious and subtle
ways.”
Maggie said she and Frank came
from the same Cape Town suburb, and
at the ages of six and 11 respectively
they first appeared together on stage.
They have been acting together ever
since. “At Drama School, I was a Manx
cat in Frank’s musical ‘The Tree That
Sat Down,’ and I’ve played everything
now from a mermaid to a whorish
chambermaid. What I really want to
play next is a frog.” Working for the
Council of the Performing Arts in the
Transvaal they were always cast
opposite each other. “We fit, we have
the same humor.”
Frank: “It was exactly one year to
the day, from the time Maggie and I
sat in a car and discussed leaving
South Africa, that we opened in Perth.”
Will they return to South Africa?
“Maybe, but not for some time. We
have a contract for a year now with
Mr. Harry Miller, and we’ll see how
things go from then.”
What else had Frank done in South
Africa? “I was always cast in the
school play, and was often sent up by
the class for speaking too well,” he said
in carefully modulated and articulated
tones. “I’ve worked in musicals, and
scored them, and we’ve acted in every-
thing from Shakespeare and Moliere
to Shaw and Tennessee Williams. I
also taught acting and drama to
Africans for a year. It was the most I
could do.”
How was serious theatre in South
Africa? Maggie: “We’ve no television,
which helps, but the people love big,
brassy musicals and variety shows. It’s
very much like here. Serious theatre,
the classics and so on are sponsored
by the Performing Arts Councils of each
Province. They don’t go outside their
Province, and each has an English and
Afrikaans theatre company, even for
children. There are several good uni-
versity theatres, too.
“It’s hard to get modern plays,
though. ‘After the Fall’ was just about
the last play to get through. Then most
contemporary English and American
playwrights clamped down Albee,
Williams, Miller, Pinter, and so on.
They won’t allow performances in South
Africa. It’s very hard. We mainly per-
form classics and local stuff.”
It was almost time to go. The coffee
lounge proprietor was asleep, and the
candles were melting into small pools
of red wax in which Maggie paddled
her fingers. She went on, “But it’s
amazing how liberal some groups of
people are becoming over there, even
among the Afrikaners.”
Closing, we asked how they worked
up their material. Maggie: “Oh, any-
where. Sometimes we even go to films
that are sure to be bad, and then we
write down all the cliches.” Frank: “At
parties, if someone says or does some-
thing, perhaps quite innocently, we have
a ‘did-you-catch-it’ signal, and then
later perhaps we work the phrase or
gesture into the show, or use it as the
basis for a new sketch. In South Africa
we performed to private audiences, and
tested ourselves on our friends.”
Maggie: “We’ve got loads of ideas,
really. It’s just a matter of waiting until
the time is right.
Will they be presenting the same
show in Sydney? “Yes, and then we’ll
take it around a bit, and then per-
haps back to Sydney with new material.
We’ll play it "Toy ear.” How do they re-
hearse? Maggie, laughing: “Oh, at each
other, and then we tear each other
apart.”
Are they interested in political
satire? Frank: “We don’t like to be
limited to a particular time or place,
but cur values are implicit in our
show.” ROBERT WARD
MAN AND MACHINE
RECENT breakdowns in the Sydney
Stock Exchange computer caused a
bit of a flap in some of the downtown
money mills but didn’t greatly disturb
the financially uninvolved, except,
perhaps, to send them into a knowing
nodding cynicism about the whole busi-
ness of placing so much faith in a
machine. But when the sports pages
reported a “shock announcement” from
Flemington that the Victorian TAB
computer had broken down the, ugh,
computerisation of society seemed to
have gone a bit too far.
In prose they usually reserve for in-
juries to Barrassi or Raper the sports
writers reported that the breakdown had
delayed off-course win and place divi-
dends for the last race, and was “so
mysterious that none of the electronics
experts know what the trouble is.”
Then Dick Brandon, a United States
computer wizard, arrived in Australia
with the sobering news that 50 percent
of the 30,000 computers installed in
the U.S. were not operating effectively
because top management didn’t properly
understand them. Somewhere, some-
one murmured, “I told you so.”
There are some of us, old enough to
marvel still at the magic of steam radio,
to whom the computer is an automation
to be regarded with caution and sus-
picion in case it gets above itself. We
don’t know much about it so we don’t
trust it.
And no one, really, has done an effec-
tive PR job on the psychology of com-
puter; computerised cheques and bank
statements only seem to have proved
how cold banking can be — and how
much longer some of its processes can
take when tangled up with electronics.
None of which stops the steady spread
of computers. There are now 700-odd of
them installed in Australia and an IBM
man (who by no means claims that his
company’s trademark is on all of them)
tells us that their operating record is
very good.
“There are really only two major
causes of a computer breakdown — a
fault in the standard circuitry or faulty
programming,” he says. “If a computer
has been programmed properly . its
results are infallible.” Tell it to the
punters at Flemington.

'What's all this about link-system planning?'
Link-System Planning is Reming-
ton's vital new concept for in-
creasing work-flow and efficiency
to cope with today's business
demands and quickening tempo.
Whatever type or size your busi-
ness may be, our experts can
after a fact-finding survey plan
a Link-System that will bring you
a dramatic upthrust in overall
efficiency and greater profitability.
Take your accounts department
for example, it could start with that
basic adding machine. To this is
linked the function of a Remington
Accountamatic-Accounting
machine, linked perhaps to the
function of a Remington Offset
printer linked again to the function
of a Remington Folder-Inserter
or mailer. Result: total efficiency
and ease of work-flow.
You are in now the unique and
highly advantageous position of
not only doing all your adding and
accounting and invoicing, but also
printing the actual forms, then
folding and inserting them in their
relevant envelopes. All automatic-
ally because of your Link-System.
Get the idea ? And whatever
Link-System you may need, we
also guarantee, without cost to
you, to train your staff to operate it.
Your enquiry will be given our
experts' complete concentration.
And security. Obligation free.

Learning to be
bosom friends
with everyone
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
OUTSIDE THE Oriental Room of the
Carlton Rex Hotel there are four men
indulging in the Western practice of
calling everyone by his Christian
name. Hel-/o, Daphne, says one, turn-
ing on a great big-brotherly smile. Ah.
What a beautiful name that is. His
sister’s name is Daphne, too. He is
Gordon Coles. He begins writing on a
raspberry-colored enrolment card. Be-
side him sits another man, Tad Scan-
lon, christened Thaddaeus, he says, after
Judas. And he repeats this beautiful
name in a loud American voice, then
prints it on to a cardboard lapel badge
along a line he draws with a pink
plastic setsquare. Oh, you’re from The
Bulletin, Daphne. Well, that is a lovely
periodical, or would you call it a news-
paper?
This is the Carnegie formula at work.
IRA. That is, Impression—Repetition
—Association. How to remember names
and put people at ease in one foolproof
go. And tonight is a preview of what
Dorothy Carnegie can do for women
(Dale does it for men), details of which
are printed on flesh-pink, rose-sym-
bolled pamphlets and entitled, a shade
physically, Personal Development.
Inside the Oriental Room sit 34
ladies, variously dressed and aged,
awaiting their instructors, Mavis and
Adeline. They are a little nervous be-
cause the thing is, though everyone
knows this preview class is free and
with absolutely no obligation, it’s all
printed in the letter, or advertisement,
or whatever got them there in the first
place, the thing is you can never tell
these days, salesmanship is so slick.
Well, they are going into this or
not —with their eyes wide open. So
they wait and Mavis peers at a woman’s
lapel, then bursts into a whoop of
laughter. Oh, she thought that was a
strange name, it is a diamante brooch.
Would you like to introduce your
friend to me? she asks the woman next
to her. Certainly. This is Betty Sullivan.
Mavis turns and sotto voce explains to
Len Macpherson, the Carnegie Sydney
sponsor, that Betty’s husband is man-
ager, or it might be managing director,
of Global Tours. By the way, doesn’t

he, Len, have a few people from
Arnott’s? We have a lot, says Len
primly.
So the preview class begins. Mavis,
now in the Oriental Room, is saying
earnestly, “We know you are going to
thoroughly enjoy this course because
it is for personal development. Not seven
percent, not 33 percent, but all of you
will leave feeling so glad you came.”
And outside, lighting up a Stuyvesant,
Tad is saying that ten percent of ’em
in there will fail. Well, Dorothy’s stan-
dard is so high that unless a student
reaches it she’s not allowed to graduate.
Sure, they refund the money. Their
instructors also take yearly refresher
courses to keep au fait with Purpose-
ful Life, and they can be failed, too.
True. Last time three barristers dipped.
No names, says Ted, not even Christian
ones, but they weren’t too happy about
it. Good Lord, no, they didn’t feel in-
adequate. Once a Carnegie man, always
a Carnegie man.
Mavis stands centre room, waving at
her IRA board. Now, why, she asks,
why don’t we remember names? Be-
cause, replies a voice, we don’t .pay
attention when we’re introduced. Mavis
radiates. Stand up, please. That was
GOOD. Give her a clap. We don’t
remember faces, says another, and
Thank you, that’s good. Give her a
clap. We don’t try enough. Thank you.
Give her a clap. We’ve cluttered minds.
Cluttered? Yes. Very good. Give her a
clap.
... So what we’ve got, says Mavis
triumphantly, she might’ve won a lot-
tery prize, what we’ve got is a room-
ful of how-do-you-do’s. What do we do
if we don’t hear a name? REPEAT it.
They clap. And if it’s difficult, ask
them to SPELL it. They clap. And
when we get home, we WRITE it
down. They clap. Come on, cries
Mavis, clapping is good for the circu-
lation. Well, that’s Impression and
Repetition. Now for Association. What
do they associate her surname Payton
with? No, dear, not Place, thank you
very much, WOOL. That means knit-
ting, so we mime it. Mentally, of course,
or people will think we’re mad. But
Mavis can’t knit, says Adeline from the
back, not a stitch.
. . . Two hours later, when 34 names
have been impressed, repeated, and
associated, and every performance
applauded, and every woman bosom
friends with her neighbor, well, this
relationship-making thing is catching,

A few tips on exporting
gambling.
(by John Muddle, Joint Managing Director of Nutt & Muddle & Sons, Pty. Limited.)
“We first started exporting poker machines
in 1960. There are only 19,000 machines
in Australia and, to get the growth we
were after, exporting was the natural
thing to do.
“We selected some countries - a number
of big, ready markets - and got the Trade
Commissioners in each to contact agents.
We got them awn to a small list. I flew
over and appointed the best.
“It soon became obvious that the good
agents take the gamble out of exporting -
and we still say that. A good agent will
work hard for you, solve local problems,
without you getting ulcers. That’s what
we found.
‘So we took terrific care selecting agents.
That’s the best advice I can give: go out
and get a good agent. Australian Trade
Commissioners can help you.
‘lncidentally, 40 per cent of our turnover
is in exports now. Very profitable, too.”
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;
EPIC export insurance cover; Trade
Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and
Industry facilities.

The great old
boys of
South Boorook
IT IS well known that breeders of
German shepherds are net overfond of
breeders of dalmatians, and breeders of
dalmatians care little for breeders of
labradors, and breeders of labradors are
contemptuous of breeders of poodles.
It is even worse with cattle. Some
years back a well-meaning gentleman
opened an Aberdeen Angus steakhouse
in Melbourne and terribly affronted the
Hereford people. How could a decent
Hereford man be seen eating an Aber-
deen Angus steak?
So the Hereford people don’t approve
of the Aberdeen Angus people, the
Aberdeen Angus people care little for
the Santa Gertrudis people, nobody
cares for the Shorthorn people, and
there is even a suspicion that the Here-
ford people are not utterly wild about
the Poll Hereford people.
But I think if we had to put down a
social grading, then the Hereford people
would be slightly in front. They have
a tremendous confidence about being
Hereford, and, after all, they have been
at it longer. The greatest event on the
Hereford calendar, indeed perhaps the
greatest social event in the Western
District, is the cattle sale at Jim Allen’s
property, South Boorook, near Mort-
lake. There is nothing quite like it.
Even the catalogue is something to see,
No dingy black-and-white stuff, gorgeous
color-plates like a General Motors’
“Just call me Chuck!”
annual report. Furthermore, it con-
tains an aerial map for the aviators. So
in the car-park last week there were the
Rolls-Royces, the Jaguars, the Mercedes,
the Rovers, and the Valiant station-
wagons, and over by the airstrip there
were 27 light aircraft. At 10 a.m. it
was as busy as Moorabbin airport, but
the service was better. Upon landing,
one was picked up in Jim Allen’s Mark
X Jaguar and driven to the house.
In the morning Jim Allen runs his
own cattle show, complete with judging,
right on a par with a Sydney or a
Melbourne Royal, the awarding of
ribbons, and the full bit, except that
there are more gimmicks.
For a start he had this gorgeous
stretch of lawn, so green it almost hurt
the eves. In the dark brown, drought-
suffering Western District it stood out
like a boil on a bikini-girl’s behind.
There were rows of seats all around
and the gentle strains of piped music
placing “High Noon,” “Three Coins in
a Fountain,” and “Lovely to Look At.”
All the delegates from the World
H ereford Conference were there, and as
judges we. had a distinguished English-
man, a distinguished American, a dis-
tinguished Canadian, a South African,
and an Argentinian.
The South Boorook sale is said to
be the only cattle sale in the world
where you must have a ticket to get
in, and getting one is as prestigious as
scoring a ticket for the opening night
of Joan Sutherland. They come in
gradings. The best is a white ticket,
and these are for the potential buyers.
Then there are blue tickets these
are for distinguished lookers-on and
then there are red tickets for the also-
rans. This year there was such an in-
flux of noble breeding from overseas,
the red tickets, about 300 of them,
didn't get in.
But you should see the cattle ring.
Now, this is a country property 140
miles from Melbourne. The ring is
a galvanised-iron shed, which seats
2000 people in proper chairs and all
tiered like the Kooyong Tennis Sta-
dium. It is more than twice the size
of the cattle ring in Sydney and 10
times the size of the ring in Mel-
bourne.
It has refinements. The area around
the auctioneer’s podium is decorated
with great blankets made out of grand
champion ribbons from Melbourne and
Sydney. And you know how the school
hall is always decorated with pictures
of great old boys and great head-
masters. It is the same here. Very
great old boys like South Boorook
Mitta, South Boorook Vern Milton,
and South Boorook Brimful are there
to be seen.
The first auctioneer was Alf
McGeogh from Sydney. Mr. McGeogh
is large, or, as they say in the cattle
business, well conditioned, and he has
a tremendous presence. He is not
one of these machine-gun orators, but
declamatory, and a great tragedian on
a par with Sir John Gielgud. You feel
with him when he says “Are you

serious? Is it true? Is it possible that
buyers of your reputation are offering
only $2OOO for this bull?” And he
has good phrases like “Here’s a bull
with a good sirey outlook.” That
phrase “good sirey outlook” is one
that is going to come in handy from
now on.
Then he has contempt. Several times
innocent gentlemen tried to bid in
$lOO rises. “Where is the man who
made that bid? I would like to see
him. A bull, a bull here worth $5OOO
and YOU want to bid in hundreds. Now
look, this is going to be a very long
day . . .”
One time he called out, “Am I bid
3000 guineas?” There was a titter.
“Dollars, then? That one’s always good
for an easy laugh.” Actually South
Boorook only recently switched over
to dollars and even so the catalogue
included a scale for those unfortunate
buyers who still didn’t know how to
convert guineas to dollars. It went
up to $lO5O 500 guineas.
We started with the heifers, and the
prices were splendid right off. South
Boorook Cori Sande went for $3000;
South Boorook Harmony, $2000; South
Boorook Marinda, $3250.
The 28 heifers brought an average
of $1575, and then we moved into the
big stuff. Sir John Gielgud McGeogh
made a suitable dramatic pause and
announced: “You might like to stretch
adjust your girdles and trusses before
we start the bulls.”
We worked up gently South
Mcllendo fetched $12,000. “One of the
best rear ends you will ever see on a
bull,” said Mr. McGeogh.
And then we came to South Boorook
Falcone. He swayed in laden with
ribbons, Senior and Grand Champion
’67 Melbourne Royal, Senior Champion
’67 Sydney Royal. Mr McG., with an
awesome clerical tone in his voice: “I
have been selling for 25 years but never
before have I sold a quadruple cham-
pion.” Jim Allen said simply: “It is the
best bull I ever bred.”
“Is there $15,000 to start him? All
right then, did I hear ten with my
little ears?” And then it took off -—-
11-16-17-20-21-22. “We’ve already
broken the all-time all-breed Australian
record,” shouted Alf. And then it went
on $23,000, $24,000 and knocked
down to Herbert Field, of the Red Hill
Hereford Stud, nearly Finley.
Alf McGeogh just beamed and
beamed. Jim Allen beamed, all the
agents beamed, and Alf said: “Is
Catherine Allen in the audience? Jim
says to chill the champagne.”
Well, 75 beasts went for $172,050, a
record for South Boorook, and probably
Australia’s best annual sale ever
incredible in a drought year, although
it has to be admitted there were few
buyers from the Western District.
Mostly they came from Queensland.
As soon as the sale was over, all
retired to the Hereford Tent—a great,
green marquee. There were cases of
whisky, gin, brandy, barrels of beer,
and drinks and food for all were on
Jim Allen to quite a late hour.

How to be good
at being second class
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
SOMETHING LIKE ten percent of
our workforce is engaged in some
sort of managerial function. How good
at it are they? How seriously do our
governments take this into account
when they form educational policies?
In his article (“Making Managers”)
on page 39, Brian Hoad describes what
is happening at the School of Business
Administration at the University of
N.S.W. This postgraduate school, with
its second-degree course, is becoming
a catalyst among the business elites:
but what’s happening to everybody
else?
It is the real essence of Australia’s
luck that it has been a society suf-
ficiently similar to the great innovating
societies to be able to adapt their inno-
vations with a margin of inefficiency
low enough for Australia to be among
the most prosperous countries of the
world not as prosperous as the
United States or Canada, but at the
second level of high prosperity.
So far we have got away with this
despite the fact that we spend less on
research and development than any
other industrial nation, and despite the
fact that we have fewer university
graduates in our working population
than almost any other industrial nation.
We were able to do this up to the last
stages of the industrial revolution: can
we continue to get away with it in the
new technological and technocratic
revolution in which individual know-
ledge and braininess and organisational
adaptability seem decisive?
One thing would seem sure. The
gap is going to widen between ourselves
and the most-advanced technological
nations principally America and
Canada, probably Japan, perhaps a few
others. This is not so much a race that
we have lost as one in which we have
not yet put in an entry. A token of
our predicament is that in nuclear
capacity we are not only behind the
front-runners of the industrial nations
we are almost last on the list, and we
are behind several nations less indus-
trialised than we are. Simply to catch
up in this and other ways requires an
immediate training and capital-invest-
ment program. Could we have the
training part of the program next week,
please, Mr. Malcolm Fraser?
If we don’t catch up in elementary
matters we shall inevitably slip down
the list of prosperous countries as the
century draws to its close. But assum-
ing that we do catch up, we must
nevertheless become reconciled to the
fact that “the technological gap” will
widen between ourselves and the very
few nations who are leading the world
into the technocratic age. If great
industrial nations such as Britain and
France are beginning to adjust them-
selves to this possibility, it should not
be hard for us to do so. Of course we
should be spending more on research
on those matters on which our research
is unique and can lead to action. Of
course we should be spending more on
development in those cases where
existing knowledge can be put into
practice. But if we started spending
more next week this would merely
ensure that technologically we re-
mained second class.
Does this matter? In so fag as it means
that we’re not going to be as well off
or as technologically brainy as the
Canadians (let alone the United
States), there is nothing we can do
about it now. What would seem criti-
cal' is that if we are going to continue
our role as a materially successful but
derivative society Mr. Fraser should
this year make those decisions about
educational policy that will enable us
successfully to enter the age of techno-
cratic management. In this new period
of history it looks as if prosperity may
have a direct connection with the pro-
portion of trained and adaptable people
in the workforce. At present our work-
force carries one of the lowest pro-
portions of trained people of any in-
dustrial nation.
In the future we will be able to
transfer the enterprise of other nations
into our own prosperity only if our
organisations contain in-depth people
who have been educated, in varying
degrees, to react creatively to new
knowledge and to accept change. This
is just not a matter of top manage-
ment but of decision-makers right
down the line, and of the basic work-
force as well. And it is not just a
matter of business companies but of
government officials,
To equip ourselves for this almost
immediate future we must break fiom
those English attitudes toward educa-
tion and vocational training that the
English must also break away from,
For example, Australia and Britain are
among the few industiial nations left
i n the world who have not replaced the
medieval apprenticeship system with
schemes for direct industiial tiaining.

standard, some of mediocre standard,

will probably depend on the success
with which it improves the brains of
mediocre people, leaving it to second-
degree courses to give the excellent
a chance to demonstrate their excel-

The real target
in McEwen’s sights
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
SUPERFICIALLY there is a strong
resemblance between the present atti-
tudes of Country Party Leader John
McEwen and those of the late Dr.
Evatt in the post-Petrov period. Dr.
Evatt could see a conspiracy under
every bedspread. McEwen can see
or pretends to see - Canberra
economic writer Max Newton behind
every rosebush.
McEwen is unforgiving. When he
hits the vengeance trail he will ride it
to the last bitter inch. But I have too
much respect for McEwen’s size and
stature to believe that he is reserving
his bullets exclusively for Newton, an
insignificant figure on the political scene
except for the importance conferred on
him deliberately by McEwen.
McEwen will gun Newton down if
he can, in passing, but the bigger
game he is after is Liberal Treasurer
William McMahon. As McEwen’s
operations could affect the stability of
the Coalition, the implications in the
McEwen-McMahon affair demand ex-
amination.
While I am broadly in sym-
pathy with the McEwen thesis that
tariff policymaking must contain a high
social content and take into account
the preservation of Australian jobs and
living standards, I confess to a consider-
able sympathy with McMahon.
Basically, the situation is this:
Treasury (for which McMahon is the
Ministerial spokesman) takes the view
that tariff protection should largely be
confined to industries which are either
efficient or display the capacity to be-
come efficient. If this policy is followed,
some workers will be compelled to shift
from their present employment but,
.longterm, gross national product will

rise by a minimum of an extra one
percent a year. Living standards will
rise. Price rises can be held in check.
Whether you agree with it or not,
this is a respectable economic argu-
ment for a more selective tariff struc-
ture. It is advanced by reputable econo-
mists outside the Treasury. It is also
held and publicised ■ — by Newton.
For McEwen to publicly attack the
Treasury would reveal too wide a
divergence of opinion within the higher
echelons of Government. So he does
the next best thing. He attacks Newton.
By taking this line, McEwen is aiming
to get two victims with the one shot
—the Treasury viewpoint on tariff, and
McMahon.
When McEwen said officially that
neither he nor his Country Party col-
leagues would serve in an administra-
tion headed by' McMahon, I felt that
he should also publicly give the reasons
for his decision. I asked McEwen to
make his reasons publicly known. He
declined. From there on I watched
events with a certain cynical amuse-
ment.
There is undoubtedly a basic per-
sonality clash between McEwen,
austere, aloof, reticent, and McMahon,
anxious for the approval of colleagues,
but as determined as McEwen to put
his viewpoint. But senior statesmen
cannot have it said of them that their
attitudes on such major matters as the
future of a government are determined
by purely personal considerations.
They are expected to and usually
do rise above personal considerations
when national interests are at stake.
However much the personal factor
plays its part in McEwen-McMahon
affairs, McEwen. for the sake of his own
image, cannot afford to put it forward
as the major factor.
On the political side, it would have
been relatively easy for McEwen to
have stated that he and his colleagues
considered McMahon to be anti-CP,
and that while it was endurable to
work in a Coalition Government along-
side a Minister who was anti-CP, the
CP could not contemplate working
under a man who was simultaneously
anti-CP and wielding the immense
powers of a Prime Minister. But Mc-
Ewen did not take this line.
Nor can McEwen at this stage be
contemplating any charge of impro-
priety against McMahon in his alleged
association with Newton. If he is con-
templating such action, McEwen must
come out of the affair pretty badly.
When McEwen was appointed Prime
Minister after Holt’s death, McMahon
was sworn in as his Treasurer. He has
since accepted McMahon and sat along-
side him in the Cabinet Room in the
Gorton Administration.
This leaves only the fact that Mc-
Mahon is the man in the Cabinet who
prevents McEwen getting his way on
such things as tariff policy. During
the Leadership struggle I wrote that
McEwen’s anti-McMahon moves were
basically part of a policy struggle. I
see no reason to revise that opinion.

Since its beginning. 76 years ago.
Dravo Corporation has been in-
volved in the construction of
locks, dams, docks and bridges.
Dravo-built structures have
helped open rivers to navigation,
bring new business into previ-
ously inaccessible locations and
create new sources of power for
an electricity-hungry world. Ves-
sels move more easily, unload
more quickly and reduce trans-
portation costs substantially as a
result of a new lock system in
the American Mid-West. Farmers
in northern California have more
power, less fear of floods and
better crops because of a Dravo-
built dam. And people everywhere
expedite their travel and materials
handling problems because of
docks and bridges built by Dravo.
Lock, dam and bridge con-
struction makes use of only three
of Dravo's special skills: civil
engineering, fabrication and con-
struction. Your problem may call
for other Dravo capabilities such
as the design and manufacture
of bulk materials handling sys-
terns, the construction of oxygen
steelmaking facilities or the devel-
opment of a water treatment in-
stallation.

The undoing of John McEwen
IT IS ONE of the characteristics of
tragedy that sometimes the good that
men do can later undo them. So it
seemed to be last week with the Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,
Mr. John McEwen.
In his long, impressive record as
Trade Minister, Mr. McEwen did three
kinds of good that now seem to be in
conflict with each other. As might
be expected from the leader of the
Country Party he did good for the
agricultural and pastoral industries; as
a trade diplomat he did good for Aus-
tralia in its trading relations with
Japan; and as the Minister who makes
the final decisions on tariff policy his
new line in high protection has done
good for a number of manufacturing
firms.
There was an inherent conflict in
a combination of high protection and
a concern for primary industries whose
costs are pushed up by protection. But
last week showed that there is even
sharper conflict between seeking good
trading relations with Japan and set-
ting up a rigid scheme for the pro-
tection of “Australian” car manufac-
turers (that is to say, foreign firms who
have set up factories in Australia).
Mr. McEwen got himself into dif-
ficulties with the motor industry be-
cause of yet another conflict his
struggle with the Tariff Board, whose
job it is to make recommendations to
his Trade Department. More than two
years ago the Tariff Board put up a
plan for protecting the Australian
motor-vehicle industry. The Tariff
Board suggested that sales of 40,000
should be permitted before exposing
a 95 percent Australian content by high
tariff protection. But Mr. McEwen and
his Department cut this 40,000 down to
7000.
This meant that Japanese firms were
mostly deterred from setting up manu-
facturing plants in Australia. The Trade
Department plan made it more attrac-
tive to build their vehicles wholly in
Japan and ship them here as fully
assembled units. With a range of new
models, they have been selling like hot
cakes. Statistics released late last week
showed sales of imported Japanese
vehicles at 7077 for the first two months
of the year, compared to 3052 for the
corresponding period last year. Adjust-
ing for the seasonal factor, this repre-
sents an annual rate of importation of
50,000 a year. Together with imports
of 10,000 from other countries, foreign
imports would be eating seriously into
the overall Australian market of
440,000.
The impact would have been greater
but for the fact that motor sales gener-
ally have been booming. In 1967 the
total market was 413,000 and in 1966,
378,000.
But the Japanese, especially in the
four-cylinder and small-car areas, have
been wreaking havoc in these markets,
despite a 45 percent tariff barrier. With
the Japanese starting to produce a full
range of cars of excellent quality and
appeal, all firms except GM-H are
alarmed for the future. Volkswagen has,
of course, announced it is “going Jap-
anese”-—abandoning local production to
export fully assembled vehicles from
Japan.
But despite his outbursts in Parlia-
ment last week against the Japanese
car manufacturers in which he threw
everything at them from Australian
beef to Mr. Maxwell Newton—Mr. Mc-
Ewen has privately remained much
more restrained. Car manufacturers
went to Canberra last week to do a bit
of good for themselves, but the Depart-
ment of Trade gave them no promise of
simple action to curb imports. Mr. Mc-
Ewen will not display privately with
the Japanese the impetuosity he has
displayed in public. As the man who
does good for the woolgrowers and
who would like to do some more good
for Australian beef, wheat, and sugar
exports to Japan —-- he is not likely to
take any real risks. He has already com-
mitted himself against import quotas,
which would bring almost certain re-
taliation by Japan.
Meanwhile Newton had one of those
weeks which people in his business most
of the time just dream about. Publisher
of half a dozen weekly business news-
letters and a number of individual telex
news services, the burly, rough spoken
journalist was almost beside himself
with delight at the publicity got for him
by Mr. McEwen. In jest, his friends
were dubbing the Deputy Prime Min-
ister as “Newton’s PR man.”
Mr. McEwen was himself a friend of
Newton’s—once. Between 1960 and
1963, when Mr. Newton, on the “Fin-
ancial Review,” was panning the
Treasury for its mishandling of the v
economy, he was befriended by the Min-
ister for Trade, whose Department did
its best to discredit the Treasury. But
from around 1963, as Mr. McEwen
came out increasingly as a high-protec-
tionist and subsidy-man, Newtown be-
gan to talk to his Treasury friends
again, and to Treasurer McMahon. The
Treasury’s recession of 1961 and 1962
gone, and that Department doing a
reasonable job of managing the
economy, economic journalists New-
ton among them turned their critical
attentions on the Trade Department.
But when Mr. McEwen lost his cool
—in turning a policy criticism into a
far-fetched and extravagant personal
attack—he was betraying an increasing
tendency to express a growing obses-
sion. People who speak with him pri-
vately have been saying for some time
that he sees a Newton under every bed.
Diplomats, politicians, and Cabinet
Ministers have been subjected to mono-
logues on the subject of Mr. Newton.
Leading members of the Liberal
Party have for long feared that Mr.
McEwen would come out with one of
his harangues in public, and in choos-
ing Parlianment he could hardly have
chosen a better spotlighted platform.
Opposition to his policies, he explained,
Newton ... delighted with the pub-
licity
was “triggered off principally by a Mr.
Maxwell Newton, who was recently
revealed to be the secret paid agent
of the Japanese Government. He
occupies a place in the Press Gallery
here and he parades as a normal jour-
nalist.”
These allegations were no secret to
anyone. They had been spread around
repeatedly by Mr. McEwen and his
friends and Public Servants for at least
18 months, with Mr. Newton’s alleged
income on Japanese accounts varying
between $lO,OOO and $40,000 a year.
(This is a grossly over-rated estimate.)
The Press Gallery, partly at the in-


stigation of people friendly with the
Trade Minister, carried out two in-
quiries into Newton’s activities. This
ended without anyone producing any-
thing more sinister than the fact
freely admitted by Newton that the
Japan Trade Centre was one of his
clients for a tariff information service,
carrying news and comment on develop-
ments in the Australian Tariff.
But in the course of this, Mr. Mc-
Ewen’s office lobbied very hard for
Newton’s expulsion. In the final vote,
gallery journalists defeated the move
29 to 8. But, as The Bulletin predicted,
the Newton matter was introduced into
Parliament by Mr. McEwen.
The P.M. in New Zealand
A small gesture
PRIME MINISTER John Gorton’s
tangible gesture toward Australian-New
Zealand co-operation, offered during
last week’s four-day visit to New Zea-
land, reinforced existing attitude to the
Free Trade Agreement between the two
countries. He announced restrictions on
New Zealand unprocessed timber would
be lifted, short circuiting the Free Trade
Agreement by eight years. To those who
wish to believe that Australia wants the
Free Trade Agreement to work, this
was a small but meaningful contribu-
tion. To those who see New Zealand as
the primary producer destined to serve
Australian manufacturing it was another
sign the New Zealand economy was be-
ing moulded by the stronger partner
to complement the Australian.
Trade was the topic most frequently
mentioned by Mr. Gorton in his
addresses. He emphasised long-term
prospects for the agreement in the
absence of short-term achievements.
He said the “greatest area of hope
was in forest products” and dashed
hopes that New Zealand might capture
part of the Australian dairy market
when the rationalisation of the Aus-
tralian dairy industry was completed.
But the Gorton visit was a familiar-
isation exercise, not a negotiating ses-
sion. Any real developments possible
at this stage in trade will come in Can-
berra this week when N.Z. Trade Min-
ister Mr. Marshall mefets Mr. McEwen.
The optimism of John Gorton on
trade contrasted with his less public
efforts to sound out Mr. Holyoake on
Malaysia and Vietnam. Menzies and
Holt probably influenced Holyoake’s
decision to go into Vietnam. Gorton
gave no evidence of following the tradi-
tion although saying the conventional
things about the nature of the war.
Holyoake, with his worrying domestic
economic situation, is unlikely to have
urged Gorton to commit more. But both
faced the problem of resisting American
pressure to increase commitment. The
big question is did they find a formula.
Joint planning on the types of
defence equipment to be used in the
area appeared to be the clearest lines
emerging from the Prime Ministerial
discussions. The SEATO talks in Wel-
lington this week will give a clearer
idea of the drift the talks took.
Suspended judgment on the effect of
the talks is about as necessary as sus-
pended judgment on Gorton’s impact
on the New Zealanders. Politicians
seemed impressed with him. The Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Watt,
willingly numbered himself among
these, which is likely to be a significance
if Labor is elected in 1969.
Mrs. Gorton said little publicly, but
she did speak of the value of learning
Asian languages and was able to refer
to her own competence in Indonesian.
The' visit was uneventful on the sur-
face. The impact will be measurable
in the direction relations between Mr.
Gorton and Mr. Holyoake take from
Smiles all around ... Gorton and Holyoakc visit the Auckland Show
here. That they met so early in Mr.
Gorton’s term was the significant aspect.
Now the importance is in the policies
which follow from a clearer assessment
of each other.
Labor
Branch power
THE ALP forces now arranging them-
selves against the Victorian Labor
Party’s central executive still show every
sign of being more concerned to win
battles rather than wars. The campaign
against State secretary, Mr. Bill Hart-
ley, is an example.
Hartley is in a vulnerable position
on a number of counts at present, and
things will get worse for him before they
get better, but to single him out as the
source of ideological extremism and
administrative shambling in Victorian
Labor is both unfair and unnecessary.
The powers in control of the Victorian
machine can easily find a satisfactory
replacement to continue the operations
of their regime.
Yet it was strongly moved at a meet-
ing of the Victorian Parliamentary
Caucus last week that the central
executive be informed that the Parlia-
mentary Party had no confidence in the
secretary. Before it could be passed, an
amendment was carried suggesting that,
because of the danger of letters being
leaked to the Press, a delegation person-
ally confront the State executive officers
with their complaint this week.
What they expect to gain from this
move, apart from an attack of nerves
(some of the more timorous parlia-
mentarians still prefer a letter to an
oral confrontation), is not at all clear,
but it is in line with similarly inspired
moves from some ALP branches which
have written to the executive of the
party criticising the work of the secre-
tary. (One strong rumor is that at least
one of these branch attacks was in-
spired by Mr. Hartley’s apparent com-
rades on the executive who hold the
opinion that their secretary is becom-
ing too hot to handle.)
Stabbing Hartley, whether from the
front or from behind, may be an in-
teresting case of political sadism, but it
is largely irrelevant to the problem. Mr.
Whitlam was only a bit closer to the
truth last Week when he confronted the
Victorian executive with its dismal
electoral efforts and decline in member-
ship, and urged that there be more
branch participation in State confer-
ences and more branch power over the
selection of parliamentary candidates.
Then, for once, he dared to stare into
the centre of the malignancy when he
suggested that members of the central
executive who came from unions under
Communist control, or under the sway
of well-known fellow-travellers of the
Communist Party, should voluntarily
withdraw from official Labor positions.
But even Mr. Whitlam had not made


up his mind to get to the essence of
the problem until a short time before
he went to meet the executive, and
there is no suggestion from any side
that he really believed they would take
his proposals to heart. It is still obvious
that some of Whitlam’s advisers believe
that the Party will regain consciousness
and live happily ever after if a bit more
bait is thrown to the branches and few
nicer chaps are appointed to official
positions.
Meanwhile a boycott of this year’s
State conference is being organised by
some of the dissident unions under non-
Communist leadership, and Dr. Cairns
is steering toward a middle position
where he can bring both sides back into
a compromise. Battles will be won and
lost, but somehow the war never seems
to get started.
Whitlam in Melbourne last week
Protest groups
"Now is the time"
THIS WEEK, in Wellington, protesters
are staging the first Counter-SEATO
Conference, plus demonstrations, in
order to draw publicity away from
official proceedings to themselves.
Initial plans involved attendance at the
Conference by world-renowned protest
figures like Jean Paul Sartre, Mary
McCarthy, and Gunnar Myrdal. Three
men of note are, in fact, going to New
Zealand ex-U.N. diplomat Conor
Cruise O’Brien, a fiery Irish critic of
American policy everywhere; Felix
Greene, English writer on China and
North Vietnam; and Jean Lacouture,
French historian.
O’Brien and Greene are also visiting
Australia. They will be sponsored by
the various protest groups in different
States, and have been asked to take
part in a spectacular new venture by
the Australian Anti-Vietnam Move-
ment.
This is what was described in Com-
munist Party newspaper “Tribune” as
“an independent tribunal to investigate
torture by Australian forces at Nui Dat
and possibly elsewhere in Vietnam.”
The “independent tribunal” is manned
by five academics Professors F. May,
K. Buckley, W. Sutching, and A. Black-
shield, of Sydney University, and Dr.
A. Roberts, of Monash. O’Brien and
Greene are to be invited to help in
the planning of the tribunal, which will
be conducted along the lines of Bertrand
Russell’s “war crimes tribunal” in
Stockholm in 1966.
The Aid-for-the-NLF movement has
all but died out in Australia with the
passing of the Government’s Defence
Forces Protection Act. The Communist
Party is doing all in its power to get
that movement buried and forgotten.
(Only small extremist groups at Mon-
ash and Sydney Universities are trying
to provoke prosecution still.) A con-
ference of protest organisations from
all States met in Brisbane in January
and decided that apart from campaigns
of propaganda on Vietnam generally
they would throw their weight prin-
cipally behind a drive to disrupt con-
scription. The Communist Party in an
advertisement in the “Australian” for
the first time endorsed joint and mili-
tant action along these lines. It is called
“The Draft Resistance Movement” in
Monash, “We Won’t Go” in Brisbane,
and “Don’t Register For Conscription”
in Sydney.
The most active so far has been
“The Draft Resistance Movement,”
which declared in a leaflet that it had
been formed “not to oppose conscrip-
tion but to wreck it.” It went on, “We
intend to resist the conscription of
Australian youth for this war by all
available means. We will hold demon-
strations of various kinds with the aim
of making conscription as ineffective as
possible, and we will supply informa-
tion on how to fail medical exams, and
other methods of resisting the draft, and
we will encourage people not to regis-
ter.” Last month it staged noisy demon-
strations against the Prime Minister
and tried unsuccessfully to disrupt two
national-service inductions at the Swan
Street barracks, in Melbourne.
The peace movement generally is
providing published support for this
American-style activity. Last issue of
“Pacific,” a handsome publication of
the Association for International Co-
operation and Disarmament, published
“A call to resist illegitimate authority,”
drafted in the U.S. but directed ob-
viously to Australian readers. It read,
“We call upon all men of goodwill to
join us in confrontation with immoral
authority. Especially, we call upon the
universities to fulfil their mission of
enlightenment and religious organisa-
tions to honor their heritage of brother-
hood. Now is the time to resist.” The
protest-dominated National Union of
Australian University Students is par-
ticipating with a pamphlet on how stu-
dents can evade conscription.
The Student Mobilisation Committee
in the U.S. and the World Peace Coun-
cil (a hoary old communist front) are
combining to organise international pro-
test activity in the second half of April.
An international student strike is
scheduled for April 26, a “Week of
Shame” campaign in Melbourne will
follow Easter, after a “National Libera-
tion Week” run by Labor Clubs in the
various universities. “World Resistance
Mobilisation,” run by the Communist
Party itself, is due to coincide with “ten
days of anti-war” activity. This phase
of busy protesting ends with a con-
vergence on Canberra.
South Australia
Dunstan's plan
TAKING A TACTICAL lead over
his Opposition, the Premier of South
Australia, Don Dunstan, announced
a compromise boundary redistri-
bution scheme late last week. Dun-
stan’s election policy proposal had
been for a House of Assembly of 56
seats dividing the State as equitably aj
possible. His new proposal is for a
Lower House of 48 seats, three more
than the LCL planned, with the new
boundaries being drawn up by an in-
dependent commission acting on terms
very much like those given to the Com-
monwealth Electoral Commissioners.
The new scheme would mean that
eventually each of the 12 Federal seats
now being considered by the Common-
wealth Electoral Commissions would be
divided into four.
The reduction in numbers, to a
large extent, removes the important
South Australian village-pump criticism
which argues against any increase in
MPs at all. But more interest lies in the
fact that, by proposing a Commission
with terms similar to the Common-
wealth Electoral Commissioners, the new
Labor plan allows a 20 percent margin
for country electorates rationalised on
the grounds of distance from the metro-
politan areas and scattered settlement.
This is a concession which should suit
the country, and it is one which the
ALP will now tolerate in both the
Federal and State spheres. Again taking
the tactical point, Dunstan announced
that his proposals are in the main those
suggested in Federal Parliament several
weeks ago by Mr. Giles, Liberal Mem-
ber for Angas, and which have also re-
ceived support from local LCL
Members.
The Premier has clearly stated that,
while he is prepared to compromise
on method, the basic principle of one-
vote one-value must hold. He naturally
has not said anything about how the
new scheme suits him in other ways.
Superficially it removes a measure of
criticism yet does not compromise


Labor’s initial stand. It would seem,
also, that the Dunstan Government will
be able to appoint (under the Royal
Commissions’ Act) the boundaries com-
mission prior to Parliament sitting. But,
more subtly, the new scheme seems
inextricably bound up with Labor’s
massive public petition calling for new
elections. This petition will be handed
to Parliament early in the first day’s
business of the Lower House. It claims
that the March election did not “truly
reflects the wishes of the majority of
electors.” It also asks for a 48-seat
House, the independent commission,
the Federal Commission terms, and so
on. It is announced that hundreds of
volunteers will visit every country city
and town to collect signatures, and that
a far-reaching sign-up campaign will
take place in the city. With city sym-
pathies running very much Dunstan’s
way, it is more than likely that the
Dunstan ... sufficient precedent
“tens of thousands” of signatures he
desires will be found.
The end result of this may leave the
LCL in an awkward position. Until
the Labor Party is defeated in the
House, it seems the Governor will con-
tinue to act on the advice of his Labor
Ministers. There is, thus, the strong
possibility that his speech to the Upper
House on April 16 will announce only
one item of proposed legislation, that
of electoral redistribution and the con-
comitant constitutional change. Viewing
the days ahead, Labor spokesmen have
also maintained that there is perhaps
sufficient precedent for the Premier to
advise the Governor to take note of
the petition should the Governor have
to consider the holding of new elec-
tions. It seems certain that Dunstan
would advise the Governor to order
new elections should a no-confidence
vote be introduced by the Opposition
while the Court of Disputed Returns is
sitting to decide, finally, the Millicent
and, perhaps, Murray seats.
Papua-New Guinea
A national identity
WHEN THE counting in New Guinea’s
drawn-out second general elections was
completed last weekend, the final results
indicated the expected triumph for the
“radical” Pangu Pati and a future in
which Canberra’s relationships with
Port Moresby would become increasingly
troubled.
The Pangu Pati, organised in June
last year on a platform of immediate
home rule and ultimate independence,
returned a bloc of members certain to
be joined by a few others to make a
Parliamentary Party of substance. In a
loosely knit House of 69 Members, their
votes will be decisive.
Equally important, none of the other
five parties polled well. Some minor
ones, such as the Agricultural Reform
Party and the Territory Country Party,
sponsored no candidates. Others spon-
sored candidates but failed to marshall
any significant vote. Perhaps the most
significant was the failure of the
gradualist United Christian Democratic
Party.
In June last year the Department of
Territories’ widely circulated “Papua-
New Guinea Newsletter” said, “The
amount of publicity being given to
Pangu Pati is out of all proportion to
how it is regarded by the people of New
Guinea,” and went on to complain that
the UCDP was being left out of Press
publicity.
Time and the elections having proved
the Press, rather than the Minister, to
have been perceptive guides to New
Guinean public opinion, it became a
matter of some urgency to assess the now
significant party. Press comment agreed
that its platform and actions to date
would seem only mildly radical in the
Australian context. It was, after all,
only seven months ago that the Pangu
Pati expelled one of its leaders, Oala
Oala-Rarua, for saying that “independ-
ence could come in 1970.”
Those who had kept a copy of Pangu
Pad’s constitution were able to point
out that its attitude toward indepen-
dence was spelled out as: “Home Rule
Leading to Ultimate Independence.
That means we aim for independence in
the future, but we must have time to
learn and our leaders must begin to
train for this through taking part in
executive government.”
They might also have recalled its
carefully phrased clause on overseas
investment, which reads: “Pangu stands
for the encouragement of overseas capi-
tal investment in Papua-New' Guinea . . .
The security of overseas investment must
be guaranteed and, at the same time,
adequate provision must be made to
safeguard our national interests as well
as the people’s interests.”
The Party is aware of the economic
and social problems of hurrying
developments in the Territory. Although
Polling in the 1968 election
this will not prevent them pressing
for home rule and early indepen-
dence it will be against a backdrop-
of dependence on Australian capital,
skills, and financial subsidy for many
years to come. They will be pressing
for higher wages for indigenous officers,
a speed-up in “localisation” of the
public service, and more freedom from
Canberra, but not to kill the golden
goose.
Meanwhile, it is still an open ques-
tion whether the Australian Govern-
ment will bend to or resist pressures
from within the Territory. In the
Governor-General’s speech this year the
Government clearly stated its intention
“to help the inhabitants of the Territory
to become self-governing as soon as
possible.” This disposed of the Seventh
State idea, but left the timing as vague
as ever; but the remaining words were
“and to ensure that when this aim is
reached the Territory will, to the great-
est extent feasible, be able to stand
on its own feet economically.”
Last month in Federal Parliament
Mr. Barnes emphasised these aims, add-
ing, “as I have said on other occasions,
without substantial economic self-
reliance, self-government or indepen-
dence would be a mockery.”
Simultaneously his department’s,
fortnightly newsletter claimed that the
four members of the United Nations
Visiting Mission to the Territory had
“repeated their view that the New
Guineans should not be rushed toward
independence or self-government by
outside pressures” . . . but did “express
concern at the lack of national unity
they had observed so far during their
visit” which ends this week.
All four members of the mission are
experienced men from the U.S.A.,
France, New Zealand, and Liberia. Per-
haps when they are in Canberra next
week they will suggest to someone, even
to Mr. Barnes, that national unity and
national identity go together, and that
perhaps only when New Guineans have
an effective government of their own
to watch and criticise will they really
begin to feel, think, and act like mem-
bers of one nation, even if a poorer one
than the Minister envisages.

The West
Jail protest
HE IS Comptroller-General of Prisons.
His main prison is Fremantle Jail, built
not much later than Port Arthur and
only marginally less grim. Yet the pic-
ture implied by this background is the
antithesis of Colin Campbell, who is
friendly, jovial, humane, and frank
dangerously so, he proved in Perth last
week. Campbell hit out at Western Aus-
tralians and, obliquely, at the judiciary,
over the high proportion of the State’s
population put behind bars. It will be
an interesting test to see whether he is
gagged, broken, or sacked or alterna-
tively his viewpoints are adopted to en-
able Western Australia to become a
leader in prison reform.
Campbell points out that he has made
all his criticisms before, but in an off-
the-cuff answer to questions before a
National Council of Women conference
he distilled them all into a sharp and
telling attack on a system which he
heads but doesn’t like.
The State’s per-head prison popula-
tion, he pointed out, is twice as high
as in other States. Queensland, with
about double the population, had 1100
in jail in October; South Australia had
900; Victoria 2100; and N.S.W. 3700.
Yet Western Australia’s average prison
population in 1966-67 was 1016, up
from 862 ten years ago and rising at
the rate of 20 percent a year.
Of the 640 in Fremantle Jail, he
said, 300 should be in open institutions.
They were mainly drunks, maintenance
defaulters, petty thieves even a man
jailed because he had VD, and a sec-
tion of the Public Health Act provided
that he could be detained in a jail hos-
pital. He called for a wider use of bonds
and suspended sentences so that such
Campbell ... degrading conditions
people could be dealt with in the com-
munity and not bundled inside
Campbell described Fremantle Jail
as a seaside holiday home for white ants,
where it was possible to walk into a
cell and fall through three floors. It
was so overcrowded that double bunks
were being placed in the small cells.
In reply to this claim, the Minister for
Police, Mr. Jim Craig, listed the Gov-
ernment’s program to build more jails.
But Campbell’s main point was that,
because of the community attitude re-
flected through the judiciary, the more
accommodation there was the more
people would be sent to jail.
This is an Australia-wide problem,
he says, and “one that rates a long,
hard look. The Australian prison popu-
lation is rising while the world trend
is to put fewer people in prison.” Why
is the Western Australian situation
aggravated? “The answer is a simple
exercise in logic,” he says. “Our crime
rate isn’t higher than in other States;
arrests per crime are exactly the same as
the national average; yet our prison
population per head is twice as high.”
The Minister for Justice, Mr. Griffith,
was able to complete this simple exercise
in logic and snapped back: “It is not in
the province of the Comptroller-General
to do other than receive and care for
people committed by the courts to
prison. Under our system, it is the
responsibility of the judiciary to
sentence people found guilty of wrong-
doing, and I have the utmost confidence
in the judiciary.”
The reason usually given for Western
Australia’s high prison population,
Campbell points out, is the high pro-
portion of Aborigines. About 20 percent
of prisoners are Aborigines. “Yet this
State does not have the highest propor-
tion of Aborigines in the population;
I think we have the third-highest pro-
portion. The other States don’t even
bother to list Aborigines separately.”
The community, he claims, is using
prison as a means of getting rid of its
problems. Many in the community
believe offenders should be sent to jail
for punishment, with harsh conditions;
this, the Comptroller-General says, is
wrong. A sentence simply deprived an
offender of liberty and that was enough.
Putting him in degrading conditions
made the situation worse.
(Just how degrading the situation in
Fremantle Jail can be was described
poignantly several years ago by a young
Anglican minister, the Rev. Ernest
Gundry, who was with Brian Robinson
when he was hanged for murder: “I
have no claims to being an authority on
prisons. All I know is that when you
enter a place like Fremantle you enter

into small, white-washed rooms with
bucket latrines? Why should we no
longer treat them like human beings?

OVERSEAS
With Johnson going ...
Bobby Kennedy: honest man
or a fraud?
From Anthony Howard in Washington
THE VOICE has now rung out across
the nation for almost two weeks. “Give
me your help,” it cries. “Give me your
hand” —and not since the heyday of
Billy Graham’s revivalist crusades has
anyone seen crowd response to equal it.
In California, in Oregon, in Utah, in
Arizona —in all the States where Sen-
ator Robert Kennedy has so far been
on show as a candidate—it has been
no ordinary political campaign: it has
been an exercise in mass evangelism.
“Do you want Richard Nixon to be
President?” the familiar, flat Boston
accent punches the question out, and
there is a shriek of “No!” from any-
where between 5000 and 15,000 people.
“Will you then help me?” all
ecstasy breaks loose, and, for a moment,
one does indeed see the politics of
hysteria.
None of it happened by chance or
accident. For his opening gambit, the
size and the emotional pitch of the
crowds he could command represented
Kennedy’s most serviceable weapon in
trying to prise the Democratic presi-
dential nomination out of a largely re-
luctant Party organisation.
His merciless use of his appeal to the
masses could not help make him look
like an authentic radical revolutionary
the lineal descendant of Bolivar,
Garibaldi, or even Fidel Castro. On
the surface, his campaign did resemble
a popular uprising in some places,
as among the Mexican grape-pickers of
Southern California, even a peasants’
revolt.
But is that faraway tousle-headed
figure at one moment being held
up on the boot of a car by the com-
bined efforts of four security men, at
the next jabbing away with the fore-
arm from some improvised and none-
too-secure street-corner platform
really in the genuine lineage of national
heroes? Is he the hope of the Ameri-
can people, or is he a fraud on the
American public?
The question, no doubt, sounds harsh
but there is no avoiding the fact
that it is increasingly being asked about
Kennedy: not just by those who have
always distrusted him but also by some
battle-scarred warriors of American
liberalism who ought to be his natural
supporters.
“He tried to get me to work for him
—and my son. How those Kennedy
people twist your arm,” said one Negro
Civil Rights activist last week. “You
know something? I didn’t even con-
sider it. He’s the most completely pro-
grammed candidate just like he
came out of a computer we’ve ever
had in American politics. I don’t think
he’s got a gut commitment to anything
unless it’s his belief in his own
prescriptive right to be President of the
United States.”
In part, undoubtedly Kennedy is still
suffering from the uncomfortable con-
trast between the cautious calculation
implicit in his eventual decision to enter
this year’s presidential race and the
bold, uncompromising moral stand
taken from the beginning by Senator
Eugene McCarthy. If Kennedy’s nerv-
ous vacillation had been regarded
merely in isolation, it would not have
been so damaging: what made it such
a personal threat was that it appeared
to fit all too easily into the pattern of
behaviour of a man who, as some think,
has never had an eye for anything ex-
cept the main chance.
It is typical of the blind, unswerv-
ing loyalty of the troubadors of the
Kennedy court both the old fly-blown
figures like Pierre Salinger and the
freshly recruited Ganymedes from the
New Left like Jack Newfield that
they should immediately have argued
that whatever bruises their hero had
suffered in his approach-march to this
year’s presidential contest would pass
away and be forgotten in two weeks at
the most. If those bruises are still very
much there, it is because a great num-
ber of Americans are still having diffi-
culty in reconciling the sudden personal
assailant of LBJ (“It is not us it is
men like Lyndon Johnson who are
dividing this country”) with the dutiful
Party-ticket supporter who, only six
months ago, was announcing on tele-
vision: “I have great admiration for
President Johnson.” His greatest draw-
back now is that he began his run too
early, before Johnson’s dramatic an-
nouncement of withdrawal.
But the personal reservations, how-
ever deeply felt, tell only half the
story. The other doubt that nags at a
lot of people (especially those in “the
constituency of conscience,” which
Senator McCarthy has claimed as his
own) arises from a genuine lack of cer-
Kennedy in Los Angeles... mass
evangelism
tainty as to what Kennedy really stands,
for and believes in. It is here that his
most recent book of essays and
speeches, “To Seek A Newer World,”
should be a help, but it cannot be said
that it is particularly illuminating.
The overriding impression that
emerges from it is of a romantic
rhetorician rather than of a convinced
or even convincing liberal idealist.
Throughout, Kennedy makes all the-
right eloquent pleas on the need for
an all-out attack on the crises in
America’s cities, on the urgency of
bringing economic reform and demo-
cratic progress to Latin America, on the
necessity to work out a new policy in
Vietnam. But, all the way through, the
prescriptions offered fall sadly short of
the diagnoses. Every suggestion made is
safe, orthodox, and inoffensive.
In the cities, for example, the call is
for channelling-in of private investment.
In South America it is for support of
liberal democratic regimes which
conveniently skirts the real choice facing
America there, which lies between
backing military repression and allowing
Left-wing revolt. Even on Vietnam, the
Senator’s instinct for caution finds itself
immortalised in a conclusion \vorthy of
the State Department itself: “we should
be generous in our search for peace, but
we should also be mindful of the lessons
of Panmunjo'm.”
Perhaps the most revealing thing is
that it is only when the Senator moves
into the realm of metaphysical discus-
sion like the chapters on youth with
which the book both opens and closes
that all inhibitions are suddenly
thrown to the winds. The cynical and
unkind would, no doubt, point out that


extolling youth is the oldest and safest
gambit in the whole worldwide political
game.
Yet no public figure can ever before
have gone overboard for it in quite the
same way that Kennedy does. There
seems, in fact, to be no visible limit to
his capacity and appetite for worship of
the young.
“We see all around us the terrible
alienation of the best and bravest of
our young people . . . they have
struggled and sacrificed alone for too
long . . . our answer is the world’s
hope it is to rely on youth, which
is not a time of life but a state of
mind.” When delivered in the higher
reaches of that strangely compulsive,
caressing voice, phrases like that may
sound rousing enough. It is, perhaps,
unfortunate that they should ever have
been put down on the printed page:
for there they cannot help looking like
the hollow, sentimental verbiage that
they are. I happen to believe that Ken-
nedy is an honest man: but if he is
certainly not a fraud, he does, nonethe-
less, seem to me to be materialising as
something of a threat to any 'meaning-
ful political debate in the current
American election campaign.
It is not just that he has been care-
less \of truth as in his reiterated
claim throughout a whole week that the
South Vietnamese do not recruit 18-
and 19-year-olds when they have, in
fact, just started doing precisely
that.
Far more serious or so it seems
to me is his only too apparent re-
solve to take the path of the glamorous
folk-hero rather than that of the
responsible political leader. For the
moment he is Paul Jones in the film
“Privilege” suddenly come to life on
the American political stage. He de-
serves better than to go down in his-
tory as the first real-life teenage idol to
try to make it as national messiah. And
there is that irony that, with Johnson
out, he is playing the wrong part.
The Communist world
How much can Russia stand?
“EACH COUNTRY has the right to
follow its own road to Socialism.” The
slogan has been repeated so often in
recent years that it no longer makes
much impression. But the pace of
change in Czechoslovakia is now forcing
the Russian leaders to decide how much
real substance they can allow their
slogan to have. In an effort to gain
time, and keep the Czech situation
under control, Mr. Brezhnev and Mr.
Kosygin met the top leaders of Eastern
Europe, with the conspicuous exception
of the Rumanians, in Dresden on
March 23. Their purpose was to
question Mr. Alexander Dubcek, the
new Communist Party leader, on
Czechoslovakia’s intentions and also to
remind him of the international military
and economic framework within which
he must operate.
Moscow’s misgivings about develop-
ments in Czechoslovakia can be seen
in the veil of discretion thrown over
them in the Russian Press. This anxiety
is understandable. The men in the
Kremlin are faced with a choice w r hich,
in a sense, is as agonising and momen-
tous as the dilemma that confronted
their predecessors in the autumn of
1956. At that time the Russians had to
contend with a crisis that was partly of
their own making. In October, 1956,
when the Poles refused to toe the line,
the Russians gave way and gambled on
Mr. Gomulka’s ability to keep Poland
Communist. But the Budapest rising
made the Russians feel that in Hungary
power was slipping out of Communist
hands. Therefore they brought their
tanks into action. A great deal has
changed since then and Moscow’s hold
on its former satellites has relaxed. But
for the Russians the problem is essen-
tially the same: how much change and
diversity can they tolerate inside their
East European bloc?
Complete subservience to Russian
foreign policy is no longer the main
test. Rumania is a reluctant member of
the Warsaw Pact and an awkward
customer in Communist councils gener-
ally, but it does not threaten the struc-
ture of Russian power, because so far
it has not offered any real alternative
at home. The new men in Prague, on
the other hand, are unlikely to have
really heretical ideas about foreign
policy, at least in the short run. To
keep them up to the mark in this
respect, it was decided at Dresden to
consolidate the Warsaw Pact and to
hold a summit economic conference in
order to improve the workings of the
Council for Mutual Economic Aid
(Comecon).
The Czechs may be offered economic
concessions in an attempt to dissuade
them from turning to the West for
credits. Finally, to reduce Czechoslo-
vakia’s temptation to resume diplomatic
relations with the German Federal
Republic, the joint communique issued
after the Dresden meeting emphasised
the revival of “militarist and neo-Nazi
forces” in West Germany.
But it is what is going on inside
Czechoslovakia that really worries its
Warsaw Pact partners. Back in Prague
last week, Mr. Dubcek admitted that
they had not hidden their concern dur-
ing the Dresden meeting. He had
joined with them in expressing the
conviction that the Czechoslovak work-
ing class “under the leadership of the
Communist Party would ensure the
further development of Socialist con-
Soviet Premier Kosygin (left), Secretary-General Brezhnev, and Foreign Minister
Gromyko at talks in Sofia, Bulgaria, with other Warsaw Pact partners
Poland’s Gomulka at
the Sofia conference . . .
.. . with Dubcek, new
boss in Czechoslovakia ..
... and Rumanian Party
head Nicolae Ceausescu


struction in the country.” This state-
ment can be interpreted in more than
one way. It could mean that the Czechs
do not intend to depart substantially
from Russia’s bureaucratic model. Or
it could mean that the new Czecho-
slovak leaders intend to preserve a
planned economy and the public owner-
ship of the means of production, while
changing drastically the system of rule
within this framework. Mr. Dubcek
and his colleagues, who are allowing
a real debate to take place in their
country and are moving toward far
more genuine elections, can opt only
for the second interpretation.
But as soon as there is talk of com-
bining freedom with Socialism, agitated
voices are heard prophesying that the
situation will get out of hand. The
Hungarians in particular have been
uttering dark warnings about the danger
from “anti-Socialist” forces. Yet of all
the ex-satellites Czechoslovakia is the
one in which the Communists have the
best chance of combining freedom with
Socialism with some hope of success. It
has democratic traditions. Moreover,
although the Communists gained power
through a coup, they used to have
strong roots in the country and the
present shake-up is apparently pro-
ducing a new generation of articulate
reformers.
The other Communist leaders clearly
cannot keep up with the Czechs. The
Hungarians have already referred to
their bitter experience 12 years ago.
The exposed East Germans are worried
for obvious reasons; their complaints
that the Czechs are helping Bonn’s
attempt to divide the Socialist countries
have provoked the Czechs into protest-
ing at East German interference. The
Poles have shown that they are not in
the mood for taking risks. (The only
rational explanation of Mr. Gomulka’s
current behaviour is that he assumes
a free play of political forces would re-
sult in a victory for Cardinal Wys-
zynski and his allies.)
The fundamental question concerns
Russia itself. If there is a country that
has no reason to fear a “return to capi-
talism,” it is the Soviet Union. Rus-
sians who grew up before the revolu-
tion are now in their seventies at
least. For most people the question of
the private ownership of, say, factories
simply does not arise. In any case, the
system of property ownership is not
threatened by the Czech experiment.
But the system of government is. If the
Czech experiment really got under way,
Russia’s ruling bureaucracy might be
swept away by the wind of freedom
blowing from Prague.
The paradox of the present situa-
tion is that the Communist leaders of
Eastern Europe do not know which to
fear most: the failure of the Czecho-
slovak experiment, which might have
very ugly repercussions, or its success,
which by force of example -might
fatally undermine the bureaucratic
structures on which they depend.
Herein lies their dilemma and the
reason for their uneasy discretion.
Indonesia
The Javanese way
Students demonstrating for early elections outside Indonesia’s Congress before it
confirmed Suharto as President for five years and deferred general elections
THE LATEST ACT in the never-
ending Javanese political shadow play
ended last week with General Suharto
departing as President Suharto for his
State visits to Japan and Cambodia.
He left behind an undivided though
scarcely a cohesive nation, the political
epicentre of which the People’s
Congress (MPRS) had just buried
further remains of a turbulent and un-
stable past. Manipol, Tavip, and other
acronyms, the legacies and policies of
the Sukarno era, were put to one side
or repealed by the current Congress
session, while at the same time the
Bung was formally and finally deposed
from his Presidential title.
It is too easy to suggest that the
Bung’s removal and Suharto’s ascension
have taken too much time and energy
that would have been better used for
the tough tasks of nation-building. For
all that, President Suharto has almost
certainly been wise to keep the reality
of his power two or three steps behind
the stated fact of his leadership. He
could have moved more decisively more
quickly. From the outside it rather
looks as if he should. But by moving
“slowly” he. has not only prevented any
further polarisation of Indonesian poli-
tics into clashing and contending
extremes, he has also preserved a con-
siderable degree of consensus at- the
same time. “After all, Indonesia is
Indonesia,” commented a leading Indo-
nesian diplomat to me once, “and we
just prefer gotong royong (co-operative
effort) and mushawarah (consultations
toward consensus).”
He need not have been so apologetic.
One has only to look northward to the
other archipelago to see the advantages
of such an approach. President Suharto
grapples with the facts of the situation
hoping that by maintaining a high de-
gree of consensus he will develop the
nation’s power and make his five-year
plan a success.
In the Philippines, President Marcos
is permanently at odds with a situation
in which agreement on what are the
facts of the situation is all but impos-
sible, in which the pqwer that he has
is squandered, mainly because con-
sensus is virtually impossible to achieve
and, in any case, most planning is for
the next election.
Not that the facts of the Indonesian
situation are anything but depressing.
According to usually reliable sources,
while inflation was planned to be held
at five percent per month last year, the
year actually saw an accumulated in-
flation of 120 percent with the note
issue rising from 20 to 47 billion
rupiahs. The slide came in the last
quarter, with a bad rice harvest particu-
larly to blame. There can be no cer-
tainty of keeping inflation to a planned
level of three percent per month this
year.
Typical of the situation which per-
tains in most developing countries.
and contrary to Western hopes and
attention being too much focused
upon economic development and
“stability” the People’s Congress has
been concentrating upon political con-
undrums rather than hard economic
facts such as these.
Aside from the presidential issue
there was the related question of the
postponement of Indonesian general
elections, once scheduled for 1968-69.
Suharto sought a five-year postpone-
ment but has evidently compromised
for a four-year one. His five-year plan
upon which so many hopes are placed
will end in 1972, at about the time
when preparations will have to get
under way for the elections, which will
now be held not later than July 5, 1973.
In other words, Suharto has gained
time to complete stabilisation, get re-
habilitation under way, and maybe
achieve some development before any
electoral judgments are made. No doubt
there are not lacking those who would
feel it to their advantage if such judg-
ments are made earlier—but they have
agreed to the postponement.
Similarly, it looks as if Suharto has
also won his battle to retain the emer-
gency powers which so far he has
mainly used to ban the PKI (Com-


munist Party) and to try those involved
in the abortive Gestapu coup. An
orthodox Muslim attempt to change the
1945 constitution with its more liberal
provisions vis-a-vis religious practice
was made but has not succeeded.
Nonetheless the Muslim groups in
Congress remain a significant factor in
Indonesian politics with some of them
siding with the man who waits in the
wings, General Nasution, like Nelson
Rockefeller not ostensibly pursuing
presidential power but nonetheless hop-
ing one day for “a call,” and quietly
preparing the ground in case it comes.
Nasution may not be up against com-
manding intellect, but he certainly faces
a penetrating intelligence and a shrewd
politician.
President Suharto is no latter-day
Cromwell packing the Commons in
order to have done with it. Reliable
sources indicate Suharto did not merely
appoint his own followers in order to
stack Congress but actually consulted
all factions about whom to appoint—
and they were not all Suharto Loyalists.
Should they have been? The Javanese
way of doing things may be tortuous,
devious, call it what you will. Objec-
tively time would not appear to be
on the shadow play’s side. But if
Suharto’s Indonesia appears not to be
moving fast enough, then at the very
least it is moving perceptibly and, on
the whole, together.
Malaysia-Singapore
Brink of partition
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Singapore
LAST WEEK Singapore’s Prime Minis-
ter, Lee Kuan Yew, made the first of
a series of Ministerial television
appearances and broadcasts on the
forthcoming “crucial years.”
Considerable public works expendi-
ture will be one major antidote to the
economic consequences of the acceler-
ated withdrawal in Singapore, he said.
Express highways, a second industrial
complex like Jurong, land reclam-
ations, earth-moving and site prepar-
ation with roads, water, power, and
sewerage for luxury hotels and apart-
ments accelerating urban renewal with
maximum private participation and a
heightened tempo of Housing Board
building of new townships are what Lee
Kuan Yew envisages.
“No white elephants, no monuments,”
he added, pointing out that the projects
would be labor-intensive and would be
financed “more through voluntary and
induced savings than increased tax-
ation.”
This was his first major televised
speech since returning from England.
It was an austere and sombre effort,
more than faintly Churchillian in
manner and made the more so since
Lee, who usually prefers the rehearsed
ex-tempore style, obviously was not at
home reading the idiot board.
As is usual he delivered the same
speech the same night in Mandarin
and Malay. Only the Tamil version was
translated for him it rather looks as
if we shall not now see the wonderful
sight of Lee Kuan Yew arguing with
Madrassis in their own tongue. While
Lee’s elusive and allusive style was
missing and the dramatics were re-
strained, it was otherwise a typical per-
formance, with Lee’s eyes narrowing,
his fist clenching (not pounding), and
a general feeling of toughness being
conveyed.
But then he was describing a tough
situation. “We have the highest density
of population in the world” with only
colonial Hong Kong at over 9000
persons per square mile beating Sing-
apore’s more than 8000. “The more
people you support in one square mile
the better organised and the more com-
plex must your social, economic, and
political institutions be. Your educa-
tional standards and industrial and
technological skills must be higher.”
According to Lee, “By 1971 one-fifth
of our GNP will have gone; 30,000
direct jobs will have gone; probably
another 10,000 to 15,000 indirect jobs
will have gone. We must become a
self-reliant industrialised nation-State,
responsible for our own security,” Lee
added.
It was the kind of speech about
which Westerners can be forgiven for
wishing perhaps mistakenly more
Afro-Asian leaders would make. Lee
has obviously read the reviews of Gun-
nar Myrdal’s “Asian Drama.” “If we
President Suharto
in conference with
Japanese Prime
Minister Sato at
his official
residence at the
weekend
were a soft society, then we would
already have perished.
“We must fight for ourselves. This
is the acid test. Have we the will to
be a nation? Have we the grit? We will
not flinch from the unpleasant and we
will not yield to the temptation of a
soft way out when this is no way out.”
All of this i$ perfectly applaudable,
especially when put against Lee’s cor-
rect assertion that “there are very few
communities that have - demonstrated
their stamina, vigor, and vitality in spite
of an enervating climate.”
The trouble is, of course, that Lee
seemingly admires toughness for the
sake of toughness, sometimes pursues
the unpleasant unnecessarily and forgets
that the soft word still turns away
wrath.
Just how fateful this tendency could
prove to be came close to confirmation
last week when there was serious de-
terioration in Malaysia-Singapore rela-
tions over “Operation Swap.” Only on
the brink, in fact, on Saturday night,
did the two countries pull back from
virtual partition on the issue of expul-
sion of each other’s surplus non-citizen
labor.
Instead of sensibly consulting and
discussing with Kuala Lumpur the fact
that Singapore cannot offer job oppor-
tunities for Malaysian citizens, in the
last couple of weeks or so Singapore
has revoked the work permits of close
to 500 Malaysians working in Sing-
apore. It has all along been antici-
pated that Malaysians being retrenched
at British Singapore bases will strain
the weak links of trans-Causeway co-
operation, but this is a case of the
overture getting the response expected
from the first act.
Inevitably the Malaysians have
reacted more, over-reacted. There
are slightly more Singaporeans working
in Malaysia than vice versa. Kuala
Lumpur got busy working out plans
for their speedy return to Singapore.
More important, the way Singapore
went about this question once more
brought out the antagonisms never far
from the surface so soon after
Malaysia’s Prime Minister Tunku Ab-
dul Rahman and Deputy Prime Minis-
ter Tun Razak had been going out of
their way to insist on the need for close
ties.
“Operation Swap” was the Press
headline tag for what appeared likely
to become the latest Malaysia-Singa-
pore futility. “The last straw,” said one
acute observer of the threatening trans-
migration. Apart from the political
consequences, nothing would be achiev-
ed except human dislocation. Singa-
pore might have revoked work per-
mits to give more Singaporeans jobs,
but the net effect would be that they
would have slightly more Singaporeans.
Although late on Saturday common-
sense seemed to have beaten foolishness
to the post when the two Governments
decided against implementing “Opera-
tion Swap,” the disturbing fact re-
mained they had gone to the brink
of partition, and of the two Singapore
deserved the greater share of the blame.


VIOLENCE IN AUSTRALIA:
the idea and the reality
The free-for-all demonstration can
become a way of life
THE AGE OF VIOLENCE, it has
been suggested, may be a fitting descrip-
tion even epitaph for the 20th
century. Evidence for the prosecution
of such a slogan is abundant enough:
the Turkish slaughter of the Armenians,
the mass killing of Indonesian Com-
munists, the extermination of the
Kulaks, the “final solution” of the
Jewish problem, tribal carnage in the
Congo, genocide in Tibet. A month
ago 75,000 were estimated to have been
killed in one week by air force bombing
of independent villages in Nigeria. This
year a quarter of a million people will
die on the world’s roads; five million
will be badly hurt.
Most of those events and figures are
so cataclysmic as to defy the ordinary
imagination; the horror is too large
to be grasped, or perhaps the mind
shuts itself off in self-protection. W. B.
Yeats could incant about the Irish
Easter Rebellion; the weight of violence
of larger brutalities muffles both voice
and ear.
In consequence, some psychologists
argue, Western man tends to react by
projecting his concern with violence on
to a smaller screen where it is more
Imaginable and comprehensible. Thus,
the emergence of the “violence film”
(“Lee Marvin gives it to you . . . ‘point
blank’ ”) as successor to the horror
film.
Or, even more remarkable, the turn-
ing of violence into light romantic
comedy, in the resurrection of “Bonnie
and Clyde,” in which blood spurts from
faces richer, redder, and more brutally
than the screen has seen before, but
in an otherwise romantic setting, so
that blood becomes as unreal as the
glamor of the principals and the color
of the filtered sequences.
And, of course, the sado-indulgences
of lan Fleming and his imitators: James
Bond slumped forward in his chair and
conceded a wince. “Suddenly, one of
Mr. Big’s hired men broke my little
finger.” Mr. Big said: “Just a little
memento of your visit, Mr. Bond.”
Solitare closed her eyes at the torture
... The hired man said: “He’s fainted,
boss . . .”
Such a James Bond sequence is
likely to appear along with the bisexual
career of model “Tiffany Jones,” the
rural ribaldry of “Ben Bowyang,” the
matriarchal suburbia of “Dagwood
Bumstead,” and alongside “Peanuts.”
Something for everyone, even the dog,
in the family: but the sado-masochist
comic strip seems relatively 'new: a
pictorial climax of the old “twopenny
dreadful” and almost a civilisation, it
would seem, from the world of “Mutt
and Jeff.”
In Australia the opinion is now fairly
well abroad that we have begun to
share in a world-wide increase in civil
violence. The New South Wales District
Court judge who announced on his
retirement last year that “the upsurge
of criminal violence by young people
was appalling” and that he was “at a
loss to know what we can do to stop
it” was simply acting as public spokes-
man for a large number of citizens and
probably a majority of the N.S.W.
judiciary, at least.
The response to the shooting at
Arthur Calwell and the electoral meet-
ing assaults on Harold Holt seemed
to be a national cry of “Look, it’s hap-
pening here, now!” What was happen-
ing? The answer would express itself
in the form of words and phrases like
“Watts,” “the assassination of President
Kennedy,” and behind them lay the
fear of political violence.
The question may be asked whether
the contemporary pre-occupation with
violence in most Western countries is
not a projection of fantasies encouraged
by films, books, and newspapers rather
than a reflection of national reality.
What, for example, are the chances of
a person in Australia being involved in
a violent incident?
In balance against the time most
people spend reading about murder in
papers and books and watching it per-
formed and avenged on television, the
chances of their actually being
murdered are slim: about one in
30,000.
In the decade in which violence is
supposed to have increased most sharply
the 1960 s the Victorian homicide
figures, for example, show no discern-
ible trend. In 1958, 105 homicide
offences .of various kinds, ranging from
wilful murder to manslaughter by motor-
vehicle, were reported; in 1961, the
figure rose to 115; declined to 99 in
1963 before levelling at 102 in 1965.
On the other hand, it seems that
although the average citizen is now no
more inclined to commit murder, he
is much more willing to maim. Total
offences against persons with violence
reported to the Victorian police in
1946 were more than 2000. This figure
rose to 2700 a few years later, declined
to 2200 in 1951, but after that rose to
4700 in 1958 and is now estimated to
be more than 6000 a year. (Victorian


crime statistics have not been released
beyond 1965.)
Crimes listed by the Victorian police
as “offences against property with
violence” jumped from 5600 the year
after the war to 14,200 in 1958. In
the succeeding ten years the figure
under this crime index has increased at
a greater rate than population.
However, the most rapid increase in
Victoria is in crimes listed under
“assault and grievous bodily harm.” The
annual reports of the Victorian Police
Commissioner show an upsurge of
crimes of assault and grievous bodily
harm from the figures of 1700 in 1958
to 2800 in 1962, to 3400 in 1965. In a
period in which the population of the
State increased by less than 20 percent,
the rate of this kind of physical violence
doubled.
The secretary of the Victorian Police
Association, Inspector Crowley, believes
that Australia is reflecting a world-wide
trend toward violence in crime, especi-
ally over the past couple of years.
“Criminals seem to be more audacious
lately,” he said, “and there has been
a tremendous increase in the incidence
of armed robberies.” It seems significant
that the usually conservative Victoria
Police Force now requires all men in
its mobile squads to carry pistols.
The reports of the New South Wales
Police Department show an increase in
the number of “serious crimes” reported
in this decade. In 1960 the N.S.W.
Police Department gave the figure for
“serious crimes” as 32,000; by 1965 the
number grew by 30 percent to more
than 41,000.
However, drawing inferences from
any of these figures presupposes that
they have been arrived at by efficient
statistical methods; they probably have
not. Although figures from Victoria and
New South Wales, which, having the
largest populations and the greatest
concentrations of population, are
assuredly our most “violent” States,
may be useful, there are no national
statistics on crime of any worth at all.
Two Sydney criminologists, Dr.
Duncan Chappell and Mr. Gordon
Hawkins, in a report published last
year in the “Australian Law Journal,”
wrote: “Such Australian records of
crime as do exist are not only inaccurate
and unreliable but are collected by a
hotchpotch of agencies using diverse
methods of recording, analysis, and
presentation.”
The New South Wales Police Depart-
ment’s figures are particularly suspect
in their claims for clearing up of serious
crimes. According to British figures, the
percentage of serious crime cleared up
in England and Wales in 1965 was 39.2;
in London the figure for the second
half to 1966 was 23.3, compared with
21.4 for the same six months of the
previous year.
The American FBI, which collates
crime statistics from State and city
police, gave 25 percent as the American
average for clearing up for 1965. For
the same year the New South Wales
police produced a remarkable figure of
75 percent.
Although no national agency to col-
lect statistics and information on serious
crime is even projected in Australia, the
New South Wales Government in its
pre-election promises this year offered
a Crime Bureau. The N.S.W. Minister
of Justice, Mr. Maddison, said the
bureau would institute a scientific
system for gathering statistics on crime
from police, courts, and prisons. The
Sydney University Law Department has
an Institute of Criminology, which is
undertaking research and teaching on
crime at university level. Institute
people, such as Dr. Duncan Chappell
and Mr. Gordon Hawkins, apart from
their academic work, by Press articles
and television appearances, try to spread
the idea of an intelligent approach to
assessing crime and its consequences.
However inadequate are Australia’s
statistics on crime, it takes very little
research to isolate the largest single
factor contributing to increased
violence, a more casual attitude toward
violence, and the involvement of people,
normally remote from what are called
the “criminal classes,” in crimes of
violence. This is, of course, the motor-
car.
Most police and criminologists
attribute increased violence to increased
mobility. (Cynics might attribute in-
creased violence also to increased police
mobility: the constable in the Mini
instead of on the beat.) The car has
obviously helped the professional
criminal. It has even proved an effective
murder weapon on occasion.
But even more effectively, it has pro-
vided the means of helping the amateur
at the game probably a member (jf
a gang of louts to progress from
petty thieving and street-corner
squabbling to criminal acts of violence.
Inspector Crowley suggests that
higher figures for violence are partly
accounted for by assaults committed
by bands of youths in motor-cars: “They
corner some poor kid, or a couple of
them, hop out, and give them a hiding
and then speed off. The assaults are
often serious, but the offenders are
hard to catch because of their mobility.”
He adds that these youths are often
low in intelligence or educational
standards and relatively highly sug-
gestible to the kind of pictures of society
presented on films and television. “I
feel that the media have some effect on
these offenders,” Inspector Crowley
said. “And these days you cannot watch
two hours of TV without being con-
fronted by physical violence and, often,
extreme violence.”
The motor-car has also, undoubtedly,
been a factor in the increasing ease with
which mass rapes are, it seems, under-
taken. Reliable statistics on rape are
among the hardest of all to get. If the
number of cases reported rises, it may
only be that young women these days
are more willing to go through the
ordeal of police questioning and court
procedures. Young women today cer-
tainly have more freedom of movement,
but earlier inaccessibility may have
merely whetted the appetite and
sharpened the cunning of the deter-
mined rapist. And who can judge
whether young women are more “pro-
vocative” or not? Whether you think a
girl in a bikini is more or less provoca-
tive than a woman in a crinoline
depends largely on the age in which
you were brought up and your state
of mind.
Court proceedings in a recent mass-
rape case in Sydney when 14 youths
were jailed for a total of 140 years
for attacks on two girls, suggest that
such a case does not differ essentially
from, say, the noted Mount Rennie
case of 1886. For brutality and stupidity
there could not be much difference
between the two sets of young men.
The differences would be mainly that
in the Mount Rennie case, the rapists
had to rely on their own legs to stalk
their quarry and to escape from the
scene afterwards; and, of course, in
1886 four of them were hanged.
The world of criminal violence, how-
ever, is still remote from the experience
of most people. Their encounters with
Enthusiasm for pop singers can get out
of hand
it, both as agents and patients, is on
the road. The reaction to the average
social drinker to finding himself on a
criminal charge, following an accident,
or to a respectable woman but careless
driver, finding herself going through
the procedure of raising bail and having
her fingerprints taken, is generally
intense surprise.
According to the secretary-general of
the World Psychiatric Association, Dr.
Denis Leigh, traffic injuries are one of
the great psychosomatic diseases, and
two-thirds of all disease has a psychoso-
matic factor. “If you are angry or have
something on your mind you are much
more likely to have an accident than if
you are calm.” Dr. Leigh claims that
many or most traffic accidents are due
to psychological factors “like anger and
irresponsibility” in drivers.
The significant study of a team of
Australian researchers into road acci-
dents classified drivers involved in acci-
dents into victims of chance, the neg-
ligent, and the reckless. After investiga-
tions into hospital victims of accidents


and on-the-spot studies of collisions
soon after they happened, the team,
led by Dr. K. Jamieson, has come up
with the preliminary finding that of a
sample of 230 accidents, 30 could not
be classified because of lack of evidence,
in 65 cases the drivers were victims of
chance, in 35 cases the drivers were
negligent, and in 100 cases the drivers
were reckless.
The characteristic reckless driver was
younger, had a lower occupational
status and salary, drank more, and
showed less emotional and marital
stability than average. He was also more
likely to have suffered domestic and
industrial injury than' others.
These findings are similar to those
of T. C. Willett, the British crimi-
nologist, whose book “The Criminal on
the Road” claims that of hundreds of
serious driving offences investigated only
14 percent had strong claims to be con-
sidered “accidental.” Willett is strongly
inclined to the view that road accidents
are more frequently caused by those
with detectable dispositions toward
violent behaviour both on and off the
roads.
If the car can be isolated as one
factor in increased world violence, so
can another agency as old as man: the
mob.
Compared with almost any other
country, Australia has been and is a
country relatively free from mass
violence, from riot, and insurrection.
The greatest mass crime in our terri-
tories was probably the first recorded:
the murder of some 125 men and
women in a party of Dutch castaways
shipwrecked on the north-western
shores. By contrast, the Castle Hill
Rising of 1804 and the Eureka Stock-
ade of 1854 were almost mild affairs.
These latter incidents were some of
the few, following which martial law
has been declared on Australian terri-
tory. In the first case, martial law was
enforced in the districts of Castle Hill,
Parramatta, Toongabbie, Prospect,
Seven Hills, and a few others. In the
other, Sir Charles Hotham proclaimed
martial law for three days “in and
about Ballarat,” but by then the trouble
was over and the 800 troops sent to
the gold town recorded no further signs
of insurrection. Martial law has not
been declared since then.
There has, of course, been some mass
violence in the wake of long and bitter
industrial stoppages and lock-outs. The
most recent of any significance was at
Collinsville, north Queensland, last
year. An industrial dispute involved
workers in a new powerhouse being
built there. New labor, mostly members
of the Australian Workers’ Union, w'as
beaten up by the strikers, their cars
were daubed with paint. The town, said
the resident engineer of the company
building the powerhouse, in the indus-
trial court in Brisbane, was under mob
rule.
Although Australian demonstrations,
political, industrial, and for civil rights
issues, have in recent years not lacked
variety they have so far lacked
real violence. However, the “demo” as
a way of life is, like so many of our
customs today, imported from other
countries. If last week in London’s
Grosvencr Square it took 2000 police,
and 270 arrests, to subdue a not very
peaceable demonstration for peace in
Vietnam, perhaps the next demonstra-
tion in Sydney’s Wynyard Square will
be correspondingly more violent.
Most sociologists seem agreed that
under the present conditions of urban
life seme increase in violence can be
expected as the metropolis expands. In
cities, potential misfits are likely to be
more lonely, isolated, free of restrictive
habits, and possibly more resentful than
in other situations. Criminal and violent
tendencies are likely to be under less
moral and customary restraint. Youth is
freer of social inhibitions and has
greater freedom of movement.
Professor Leon Radzinowicz, foun-
der of the Institute of Criminology at
the University of Cambridge, also be-
lieves that higher standards of living
mean not less but more crime. He
comments: “More wealth provides
more opportunities for crime and
more opportunities will be taken.”
Most social scientists would not
agree that there is a greater innate
tendency toward violence now' than
in other times. What they do ‘stress is
that weaker restrictions bring with
them the possibility of more overtly
anti-social behaviour and that the in-
ventions of a rich technology have
opened up new means of doing vio-
lence: The bomb for the criminal
politician, the motor-car for the aggres-
sive citizen.
Police authorities in Australia, in
their efforts to get larger forces, have
argued that violence on the roads is
only one sympton of a world-wide
increase in serious crimes. They point
to Britain and America as examples
of what we may expect in a few years.
Their case finds support in the sta-
tistics advanced by Sydney crimin-
ologist, Mr. Gordon Hawkins, who re-
cently claimed that in Britain “on the
basis of current trends, 29 percent of
men and seven percent of women will
be convicted of a serious crime at some
time during their lives.”
Recent estimates in England and
Wales, where considerable statistical
evidence has been kept, suggest that
serious crimes known to the police
have increased tenfold over the past
60 years: The efficiency of the police
has improved somewhat but the popu-
lation in that time has not trebled. In
the past 14 years serious offences in
Britain have nearly doubled, and not
too much of it can be attributed to
West Indians or shiftless Australians.
The situation in the United States
is even more unnerving, if only because
everything there is on a much larger
scale and exacerbated by conflict
between black and white. The report
of President Johnson’s commission
which investigated last summer’s “civil
disorders” presented what seemed to
be new evidence of how violence begets
violence.
The report, particularly in the sec-
tion on what happened on New
Jersey, suggested that there were few'
Negro “guerillas” but plenty of
trigger-happy police. The Commission
complained that some police depart-
ments stockpiled machine-guns and
tanks, but overlooked such non-lethal
weapons as nightsticks and tear-gas.
“We should not attempt to convert our
police into combat troops equipped for
urban warfare,” said the report.
Whether the disorders of last summer
will remain a permanent feature of the
American landscape and auguries of
similar trouble in other countries w'ith
socially alienated minorities is anybody’s
guess, but forbodings of the internal
destruction cf urban life are not new.
They w'ere common in Europe from the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
There has never, of course, been any-
thing in Australian history to equal the
depredations of the “London mob” of
the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries; nor
is there anything in recent British
history to compare with the ravaging,
looting, assaulting band of apprentices,
journeymen, thieves, and cut-throats.
The cry “Who goes home?” is now only
a ritual memory in the House of Com-
mons at night, it was once a necessity.
In Australia the fascination with
violence is still very much lived in
images of other people’s and other
country’s experiences, or in a return
to earlier Australian incidents and
legends. And what the mass media have
taken up for public entertainment in
all countries has now become central
to the studies of many schools of soci-
ology, anthropology, zoology. Konrad
Laurens’ “King Solomon’s Ring” and
“On Aggression” are the most famous
products of the scientific study of the
world’s great pre-occupations with
violence.
For the scientist the question is:
What are the origins of violent be-
haviour and aggressive impulses in
individuals and groups and how' can
they best be socially controlled? The
answer may lie with Konrad Lauren’s
greylag geese, or with the Watts’ rioters,
or even w'ith the mythology of Ned
Kelly. If there is an answer at all.


Thailand’s

Thai Government from 1963 until 1965
In the market at Khon Kaen on the Thai-Laos border
UNEASINESS ABOUT Communist
Pathet Lao activity in southern Laos,
which is seen as a growing extension
of the Vietnam conflict, is probably
well justified. Even so, there is nothing
new about it except in degree. For
more than a decade since Dien Bicn
Phu, Pathet Lao influence m this pait
of Laos, as well as in the hills noith
of the Vientiane plain, has been con-
siderably greater than °fi icia l state-
ments have revealed.
Vientiane, in many respects, is Cloud
Cuckoo Land. Official handouts are
compiled there foi the world s Pi css by
officials who seldom go outside the
capital to find out the leal facts. And
pressmen are effectively controlled by
the fact that one may not travel into

In this region, w-hich amounts to a
third of Thailand’s total area and popu-
lation there is enough poverty and
under-development to provide fuel for
Hnypn Communist insurrections All
sparks
blowing across the border from Com-
munist regions of Laos, where the bush-
fire is already burning merrily.
The south Laotian towms of Saravane
and Attopeu, currently reported to be
under siege, are close to the most
difficult part of the Thai frontier from
a defence point of view. This is the
100 miles or so in which the border
j s no longer the great Mekong River,
as it ; s f or t h e nex t 300 miles north.
Only 50 miles north of the Laotian
market town of Pakse, the Mekong
veers eastward and, except for a single
minor road crossing it at right-angles,
frontier passes wholly through
dense, literally trackless forest.
At the 'jhju end 0 f tb i s narrow
ribbon of bitumen is Übol, one of the
biererest and busiest American and Aus-
in Asia , flying off air _
craft daily to bomb North Vietnam and
harass the columns of porters moving
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Übol see thes with intense if rather
sordid and confused activ ity. Its nar-
rQW streets are j amme d with ornately
painted Thai buses, bicycle rickshaws,
\ , . n • ’ , 1
street stalls, pigs, and childien, and
weary G ls sit hour after hour at the
steering wheels of jeeps and trucks
iriching them for the most part through
streets never built even for limited
motoi-ti attic
Few' people seem to know that this
ramshackle river town of about 80,000
i n the remote north-east is Thailand’s
second largest urban centre after
Bangkok. Few perhaps care, but the
outstanding majority of those few are
military strategists on both sides of the
Cold War.
For no clear reason the party of
students with whom I was visiting Übol
at the time decided to take a trip in
their chartered bus as far as the border
along the Pakse road and I went along
to see what was there. It is a place few-
Europeans ever reach,
Our ow-n bus, threading its way
slowly through the maze, its multi-
toned horns blaring incessantly, took
almost an hour to get out of the city,
Übol’s suburbs are untidy like those of
most of South-East Asia’s market towms.
It was a relief when the unplanned
concentrations of shophouses and huts,
with attap-thatched or rusty corru-
gated-iron roofs, petered out into
countryside.
Outside were rice paddies, little
brown-roofed villages sheltering under
giant mango trees, and the still brown
water of klongs, buffaloes submerged
in them up to the eyebrows.
The bus, now moving faster, pitched
, % \ ■.
gently backw-ards and forw-ards on its
springs on the undulating, heavily
patched ribbon of bitumen. A gentle
breeze came in the w'indow-, easing the
crushing heat.

The students began to sing, and
glasses of mekong, the Thai whisky
made by a Government monopoly,
passed freely. Soon pointing at me, they
£ eg an chanting over and over again:
“For you! For you! For you!” The glass
travelled forward from ■ hand to hand
until it reached mine. It was almost
neat mekong, but the chant went on
louder and louder, until, coughing and


Handcuffed Viet Cong paraded publicly in Pakse, Laos
Thais released after imprisonment by the Pathet Lao
spluttering, I gulped it down. Thais
are happy people.
Quite soon the cultivated belt thinned
out, and the low scrubby trees that
pass for jungle gradually increased. It
was flat, monotonous, lightly populated
country of poor fertility, and the road
itself soon became its dominant feature.
After another hour the trees thick-
ened, the road narrowed even more, and
all signs of habitation disappeared. We
rounded a sharp bend, the brakes
squealed, and the bus stopped. We had
arrived.
Everything was very quiet and the
forest and sky, simple and primal at
first, occupied one’s whole attention. It
was only after 30 seconds one saw the
small low huts that constituted the
barracks and guardhouse of the Thai
Border Police.
Thailand has two police forces, one
concerned with internal law and order,
and the other a paramilitary force
charged with preserving border security.
This morning about 20 border police-
men, heavily armed with automatic
hand weapons, as well as grenades, were
on duty. On each side of the road
into Laos was a small token barrier of
barbed wire and a sentry-box. However,
the barbed wire came to an end within
a stone’s throw on each side. After
that, stretching 50 miles north to the
Mekong and south to the Cardamom
Mountains, in Cambodia, was the forest.
In it there were no railways, no roads,
scarcely even a village.
I asked the officer on duty at the
post if this forest region were ever
patrolled. He raised his eyebrows in the
slightest possible indication of surprise,
smiled politely, and shook his head. It
would be impossible to patrol any of
this frontier except with parties on foot
and even they would need special equip-
ment and tremendous logistic support.
I did some quick mental arithmetic,
and came to an assessment of at least
20,000 men to place a man every ten
yards along this frontier region. It
would need that kind of concentration
at least to spot infiltrators, who could
inch their way through the forest within
yards of a sentry without his knowing.
On the Laotian side there was noth-
ing. It seemed that Vientiane took little
interest in this part of the border at
all, and this was perhaps prudent. On
the week before, I had stood on the
right bank of the Mekpng at Nakorn
Phanom, 200 miles north of here, and
looked across at the blue, Walt Disney
cartoon-style mountains behind Thak-
hek that have been occupied by a Pathet
Lao army for years. The Viet Minh
first established a Communist base there
just before Dien Bien Phu.
Basically the border patrol post on
the Pakse road is there to keep an eye
on the traffic, a sparse flow indeed,
amounting to perhaps half a dozen
buses and trucks a day. For the vil-
lagers, who move on foot or by buffalo
cart, the border is in any case an
abstraction they neither know nor care
about.
Infiltration of Communist cadres into
north-east Thailand undoubtedly takes
place across this frontier. A determined
enemy could get a division across if
need be without a soul who would
understand knowing what was going on.
The trees, although low, have heavy
canopies, which make an effective shield
for air spotters, while the undergrowth,
though in places thorny and unpleasant,
is sparse enough to thread one’s way
through on foot at a reasonable pace.
However, it is sufficiently dense enough
to impede wheeled or tracked vehicles.
The terrain is low and rolling without
the steep hills and dramatic limestone
cliffs that mark the last offshoots of the
Annam Cordillera farther north in Laos.
These factors, ease of access, dense
forest cover, and lack of orthodox
communications combine to make this
southern hundred miles of the Laotian-
Thai border one of the most sensitive
in the world.
The frontier is effectively barred to
large troop movements farther north
because it consists of the mighty bend
of the Mekong River enclosing north-
east Thailand. The Mekong, in places
a mile wide and running swift and
deep, is the world’s last remaining
major river unspanned by a single
traffic bridge. The open river can be
pbserved constantly from the air, and *
Thai patrol boats would be aware of
large movements across it, at least in
daylight.
The river is, however, highly vul-

neiable to gradual infiltration. In this
legion, almost wholly without roads,
the river itself is the main highway.
Every day thousands of small narrow
pirogues, each with its outboard, breast
the swift current to ply their trade.
Sinn at boats, fitted with unwieldy roof
canopies of rusty sheet-iron, act as
ferries from bank to bank.
Mekong River towns in Laos and
Thailand almost invariably lie opposite
each other, and naturally constitute two
halves of the one community. Nakorn
Phanom and Thakhek are such places,
and there are many others.
The result has been that the com-
plex family and clan groups of the
region are usually divided between the
twin towns. Uncle and aunt may be
nominally Thai; cousin and niece nomi-
nally Laotian. The relationship is none
the less close because of this, and family
visiting across the river occurs daily.
Neither Government has bothered to
set up a passport and visa system, which
the people would not understand and
which would need many more than the
available officials to administer it.
There is nominal control at accepted
checkpoint areas, such as Sri Chiengmai
and Vientiane, on opposite sides of the
river, in which permits signed by pro-
vincial governors of both countries
allow entry for a theoretical .single day.
However, it is doubtful if one in a
100 people who cross the big river do
so with any formality whatsoever. When
I crossed I had to make a half-hour
search to find an official who would
stamp my visa.
One cannot leave this subject without
considering the question of national
minorities.
In the first place the people of
north-east Thailand are not really Thai
at all. They are Laotian in tradition,
language, and art. If you ask a north-
east Thai his nationality, he will usu-
ally answer simply Pathet Lao which
means simply “Lao people” and not,
as “experts” from Bangkok have some-
times hastily assumed, that they are
unashamedly admitting to being Com-
munist.
When the Thais conquered the Vien-
tiane kingdom early in the 19th cen-
tury, tens of thousands of Laotians were
deported to the right bank of the
Mekong. Politically they became Thais,
but their traditions have not yet really
altered. This in itself is significant, be-
cause Communist agitators of the Pathet
Lao movement find themselves among
people whose language they speak in
more ways than one.
The Vietnamese are another signi-
ficant minority near this border. They
virtually control trade and commerce
in the strategic twin towns of Sakol
Nakorn and Nakorn Phanom. This
group of about 30,000 people fled into
north-east Thailand during the Viet
Minh’s struggle with the French two
decades ago. They are mostly North
Vietnamese, from Hanoi and Vinh.
For a number of years the Thai Gov-
ernment has deported a set number each
year. A controversial aspect of this
policy has been that the Vietnamese
communities themselves have been
called on to nominate who should be
deported.
However, the long-term results are
considered to be slight. It is known that
many of those deported slip back over
the Mekong within a few months, take
a new name, and begin all over again.
One night, strolling through the
moonlit streets of Sakol Nakorn with a
north-east Thai friend, we identified 11
of 14 radios playing loudly as being
tuned to Radio Hanoi. This does not
mean, of course, that all the people
listening were Communists or even
sympathisers, although some probably
were. All Vietnamese like Vietnamese
music, and I was told Hanoi’s music
programs were regarded as much bet-
ter than Radio Saigon’s.
Yet beyond all else, the major diffi-
culty on this uneasy frontier is economic.
North-east Thailand is poor and under-
privileged. Its major politics relate to
the problems of keeping a full belly.
In this lies the greatest weakness. The
border, heaven knows, would be a night-
mare to defend. What is beyond it
represents quite another problem.
The problem is great, but not beyond
solution if it is regarded in realistic
and that means economic terms.

A group of young stockbrokers’ clerks
are fronting Ye Gunsmiths Bar for 15
cent glasses of dry red to wash down
their 75 cent helpings of Vienna
Schnitzel, while two solicitors’ secre-
taries deliberate between a 25 cent
champagne cocktail and something
called a London Fog for 30 cents.
Cahills is now assuredly Australia’s
largest chain of medium-price res-
taurants and is a public company, which
regularly pays 15 percent dividends,
and with shares currently priced at
four times par value.
Cahills serve between 50,000 and
60,000 people a week, their low-prices
policy straddling with ease the gap be-
tween people whose attitudes toward
eating out are generations apart.
Mr. Sturzen puts it this way: there
are those who don’t mind helping them-
selves from a service counter if the
food and atmosphere are right, and
those who see table service as an essen-
tial part of lunch or dinner in a res-
taurant and are ready to pay a little
more for it.
Since Cahills became a public com-
pany six years ago, all but two of
what Cahills’ brochures call the
“traditionally pleasant service res-
taurants” have become fully licensed,
dispelling a little of the cosy conser-
vatism they’d gathered about them
during the preceding 30 years; Mr.
Sturzen’s “new breed” revolution, the
Brass Rail self-service restaurants, has
appeared and proliferated. It seems
that every time a new, tall building
opens in Sydney, Cahills are in on the
ground floor.
The Brass Rails are licensed to serve
wine or wine based cocktails only, and
their informality and low prices make
them popular with the late teenage-
twenties group.
Cahills now operates on a 50-50 ratio
of old to new, with seven Brass Rails
and the same number of service res-
taurants, but the Brasserie, the only
service one opened during the past five
years, incorporates a wine bar and self-
service section as well. And with
escargots, oysters parisienne, and coq
au vin on the menu, it is a few years
removed from the Chicken Maryland
syndrome.
Max Sturzen, the man who has
steered Cahills in its new direction,
joined the company 32 years ago as
a chef, soon after arriving in Australia
from Switzerland.
Ten years before, Reginald Cahill
and his sister, Theresa, had started the
business with a series of tiny coffee
shops in the city. They had no ex-
perience in running restaurants and
very little capital, but the business grew,
they acquired theatre catering rights,
and after the Depression opened the
first Cahills restaurant in Castlereagh
Street. It has been in operation con-
tinuously ever since, except for 10
days in 1966, when the interior was
renovated as the result of a fire.
Mr. Sturzen worked as a chef for
a year before becoming a restaurant
manager, then assistant to Miss Cahill,
who took care of day-to-day business
of running the restaurants, while her
brother initiated new ventures, among
them a quick-freezing plant, a candy
factory, a bakehouse, and a chocolate
factory.
“The chicken sandwich and the
novelty ice-cream cake were Miss
Cahill’s,” Mr. Sturzen remembers, “the
restaurants became famous for themT
By the time Cahills was ready to
become a public company (it now has
1100 shareholders), Sturzen was its
general manager, and afterwards be-
came its managing director. A tall,
elegant man with a striking, frequently
photographed wife, he holds dual Swiss
and Australian citizenship and is res-
ponsible for the determinedly cosmo-
politan lines of the menus and decor-
of the newer restaurants.
He has imported most of the fittings
for Brass Rail restaurants like the
Mexican Inn, the Island Trader, and
the Dutch Village, while the London
Tavern looks suitably Old World with
a solid counter and bar fittings bought

From chicken sandwiches and tea to
coq au vin and wine
from Aarons Hotel at the time of its
demolition.
“People care about decor today,”
Sturzen says. “Cahills used to be con-
servative because Sydney the whole
of Australia was conservative. But
five years ago, attitudes started chang-
ing and we had to change with them.
And after the company turned public
we had more money to play with.
“Before she retired, Miss Cahill and
I used to be in conflict over whether
the restaurants should be licensed or
not. She thought we could do without
that, but I am a Continental and
believe there is no healthier way to
enjoy food than with a glass of wine.
“The cocktails in the Brass Rails
are different mixtures of wines and
fruit juices very pleasant drinks
and we do them up in glasses to go
with the decor. I think we’ve done
quite a lot to help make wine popular
in Sydney.”
The first Brass Rail the Vintage
Bistro in Mark Foy’s department
store, opened four years ago in a blaze
of vintage car motifs. “At that time,
that part of town was dead, offices
were moving out of the city, although
that’s all changed now, because they’ve
all moved in again.
“But we knew that a parking station
was opening and that office space was
going to be available in Mark Foy’s
itself it helps if you have a resident
office population and Mark Foy’s
management supported us, so we
thought it was worth a try. It was a
success grew rapidly in the first
year.”
The style of their restaurants may
have changed, but the pattern of
Cahills administration has not. The
policy is still “good food at a price
within everybody’s range,” and the
company is still expanding at its tradi-
tional rate of a new restaurant every
year or so.
Recently, the establishment of each
new Sydney development has been the
simultaneous cue for a new Cahills
restaurant the Polynesian-inspired
Island Trader in Goldfields House, the
Mexican Inn in the re-vamped Imperial
Arcade, and the Dutch Village in the
Park Regis building.
“The developers like us because we’re
established and they know we’re not
some fly-by-night company, and I like
new buildings because I hate old-
fashioned kitchens and because with a
new building you can be assured of
this resident population.”
Occasionally, there are false starts,
for example, the Petit Paris in the
Lasalle Building closed last year when
the complex failed as a shopping centre
and it was decided to re-style the
building as an office block.
“Lend Lease put it to us that we
close down, and we had no capital in-
volvement there, so we moved to the
next block, the Temple Court, and
opened the Brasserie.
“We had a restaurant at Manly near
the Oceanarium, but we weren’t getting
the thousands we need for restaurants
like ours, so we sold out. We’ve closed
other restaurants, too, but usually be-
cause the premises have been too small.
After all, it costs no more to manage
a shop big enough to take 300 people
than one which takes only 80.
“We’ve also sold the quick-freezing
company. The only one in operation
now is the one which makes our choco-
lates, the sauces, and cakes and pies, too.
It’s at Chippendale. All the other food
is prepared on the restaurant premises.”
Reginald Cahill’s son, Peter, is the
only member of the family still actively
concerned with the company. When
he was growing up, he worked after
school in Cahill’s factories, and after
taking his science degree he joined the
business. He’s now on the board of
directors, in addition to managing the
Mexican Inn.
Statistics about food and drink con-
sumption in the chain’s 14 restaurants
are formidable 10,000 steaks a week,
40,000 gallons of wine a year.
“I have never claimed that we make
food for the connoisseurs. Our food is
made to appeal to everybody, but we do
introduce international dishes. We don’t
have famous chefs, because they don’t
always want to do what we want to
do, which is food for everyone.
“I didn’t like the self-service idea in
the beginning I still hate the cafe-
teria style of eating, but I realised self-
service had to come, because it’s so
hard to train waitresses these days.
Everybody wants to be served, nobody
wants to serve.”
So in these aggressively egalitarian
times, everyone gets by with a little
give and take the customers do some
of the work, bread and butter is free,
and, most important, there’s not a stain-
less steel tray in sight to mar the decor.


Making managers
By
BRIAN
HOAD
Students at the School of Business Administration, University of New South Wales
TWO WEEKS ago the School of Busi-
ness Administration at the University
of New South Wales was presented with
its first scholarship, the first business
studies scholarship in Australia; worth
S2OOO, tentative for a year only in
the first instance and, a little sadly,
not Australian; the benefactor is Time-
Life International. For Professor
Neville Wills, scientist, economist, and
for ten years manager of the commer-
cial research department of BHP, it
was nothing to get worked up about.
It was just another step in a pro-
gress which began with himself and 20
students six years ago and continues
today with 200 students and a staff of
seven.
Wills guides his students through a
game of “role-playing”: they discuss the
cheapest ways and means of building
this plant in that time; they doodle on
the inevitable note pads with their
freshly sharpened pencils; somebody re-
tires to the lavatory; the others chat,
on golf or food or the problems in
hand. They are studying the behavioural
pattern of a meeting of company
directors. Wills sits by ready to expose
the ridiculous, to prick pomposity, to
reveal failings. The lesson for today is
that directors, particularly Australian
directors, are only too human.
Wills is lightheartedly venomous
about the failings of Australian direc-
tors, the sine qua non on which his life
centres. He waxes eloquent on how
they grew rank like weeds under the
protection of import restrictions, inter-
company trade agreements, tariffs,
bounties, and monopolies; how they
grew overripe in the sun and waited
for the Americans to pluck them up.
He deplores the indifference called
tolerance bought with golden hand-
shakes which greeted the takeovers
when they came. And yet he is amused
to think that since they had laid them-
selves open to rape they did not enjoy
it more. Pragmatism and hedonism are
his particular enemies, and his victory
will be the establishment of schools of
business in every Australian university
under the full support of industry,
commerce, and government.
With important fields of the nation’s
economy slipping ever further under
foreign control there is an urgent need
for such a victory. Students of the
social patterns of rats and other forms
of cerebral life tend to agree that
leaders are born, not made; that some
inscrutable law of nature provides for
two percent of the population to have
a potential for leadership. Unfor-
tunately, our affluent society demands
that closer to ten percent of the work-
force must involve itself in some sort
of managerial function and, to make
matters worse, has established the man-
ager as a distinct factor of production
in the face of a classical economic
theory which sees increased output
achieved quite simply by the applica-
tion of more capital and more labor.
There are ways round this uncom-
fortable situation. There is the cur-
rent tendency toward fewer and larger
firms which extends the influence of
the more able managers over a wider
economic scene. There are ways and
means —with the help of management
consultants of winkling out the more
reticent or lazy members of that
favored two percent; good managers
are often lazy. And for the rest it is
becoming a matter of education; of
squeezing square pegs into round holes;
of synthesising silken purses from sows’
ears. To hell with natural laws, with
ulcers and thrombosis managers
must be made.
In the beginning (1908) was Harvard
and the word was with Harvard and
Harvard still is the word . . . “And the
light shineth in darkness and the dark-
ness comprehended it not.”
It took two world wars and nearly
40 years before the dearth of managerial
talent was made known for the first time


in Australia. Technical colleges set up
educational programs leading to
diplomas in foremanship and supervision
which became, and still are, very
popular. “But staffing them remains an
endemic problem,” says Wills since
they come under State Government
they must inevitably suffer from the
consequent and severe limitations on
pay and prospects. They also lack
“social acceptability” and “aura”
Wills has no doubt that such values
must be taken seriously: “We are out
to produce a new elite. We must, there-
fore, aim at functioning within the cor-
ridors of power.”
World War II also brought into being
the Australian Institute of Management,
which set itself the task of providing
short and specific lecture courses for
those perplexed by, or interested in,
modern management problems. The
courses have been extended over the
years and “provide a most useful exten-
sion service to practising managers and
those who may one day fill their shoes.”
But by and large industry and com-
merce continued to remain insular,
behind a thick blanket of protection,
neither perplexed nor interested but
simply indifferent. Twenty small firms,
manufacturing the same product, would
be seen to move only in the cause of
further protection, as it were to make
room for 25. And yet “that jungle of
base ineptitude continued to make a
profit.”
It was in the universities, which had
remained aloof from the marketplace
and were indeed sceptical that a body
of knowledge called “management” did,
in fact, exist, that the true light eventu-
ally dawned, brought back from the
U.S. by returning graduates. In 1956,
as an experiment, the University of
Melbourne pioneered a six-week sum-
mer school in business administration.
“The more enlightened or inquisitive
firms” sent along about 40 executives.
It was a success. The school was re-
peated, and in 1963 became fully insti-
tutionalised under the current Professor
of Commerce and Business Administra-
tion, John Willett.
But it was the University of New
South Wales which was the first to
establish a chair of business administra-
tion and create a distinct graduate
school. Neville Wills took up his post
at its head in February, 1961. In the
following year he opened shop, offering
a three-year, part-time Master of Busi-
ness Administration course for post-
graduates. There were 40 applicants
“motivated by curiosity” and 20
students were taken on. There was one
lecturer to help Wills out. By the fol-
lowing year the student body had in-
creased to 35.
No financial help could be squeezed
from the Federal Government “they
have been extraordinarily negative
toward management education and have
still not provided a single specific ad
hoc grant” the much-needed extra
staff could not be taken on. Wills
decided to make a fund-raising sortie
back into industry to pay for the estab-
lishment of a Professor of Marketing;
who materialised two years and
$160,000 later. In the flush of that
major success, a two-year full-time
course was started modelled on that at
Harvard. In the same year Australia’s
two first graduates in business admini-
stration emerged. The school had “taken
off.”
The MBA was gaining a reputation
for being a tough degree. There was
a growing demand for something easier.
This year, for the first time, a two-year
diploma course in administration
“only half as tough as the MBA”
was offered and 30 students admitted.
Sixty new students were admitted to
the part-time course and nine to the
full-time, bringing the total student
force up to just over 200. Of these, six
are employed on original research
studies for their Ph.D.s. These will be
the teachers of tomorrow.
The growing interest of the business
woxld at large in the work of the school
is reflected not only in the stream of
telephone calls which Professor Wills
receives about the availability of future
Professor Neville Wills
graduates. Many firms send people to
the part-time courses, and to impress
the importance of the school upon all
concerned Wills demands some
day-release—“it also lightens the load
on the staff.” In the full-time courses
the patronage of the business world is
less apparent. There is one student
financed by the Japan-Australia
Business Co-operation Committee, a
Colombo-plan student from Thailand,
and another supported by Esso. Wills is
fairly happy about the way “in-com-
pany” management training programs
are gaining in popularity. “Common-
wealth public services and some of the
State public services started the ball
rolling. Not that anything like a
majority of companies participate, but
larger ones do, and these, after all, are
the major determinants of production
and of economic activity in Australia.”
But the demand for places in the
school, and at Melbourne, is about
three times capacity. Wills is annoyed
that he has to turn anybody away, yet
there are no signs of the institutions
catching up with demand. Melbourne
runs the same sort of courses, has the
same number of staff, but only half the
number of students as at N.S.W. Mac-
quarie and Monash are said to be “on
the threshold” of doing something. Wills
thinks that the Federal Government
no matter how belatedly should start
handing out direct cash grants for busi-
ness education, and suggests a closer
look at that part of the U.K. employ-
ment tax which goes toward manage-
ment training.
During the two years of the full-
time course at N.S.W. there is a moun-
tain of bookwork to be moved on the
subjects of accountancy, economics,
law, and international business opera-
tions. There is the mystique of data
processing to be unveiled and mathe-
matical technique's in the fields of mar-
keting, financial management, and pro-
duction to be mastered. But the greatest
amount of time in the first year is
claimed by “behavioural science.”
Professor Wills admits that the school
has become biased toward “behavioural
science” —a general wandering through
the mazes of psychology, a study of
human behaviour, a dissection of Aus-
tralian society. The aim is that the
student should come to understand
himself and the people with whom
and through whom he is going to
work —■ “an important criterion of suc-
cessful management is a well-adjusted
character. There is far too much guilt
involved in organisational behaviour.”
Students are encouraged to look at
their own attitudes and prejudices
whether they involve abortion or Viet-
nam or sexuality. They are instructed
in the art of co-operation “Most
senior managers haven’t got a clue how
to utilise the talents of their juniors”
-—learning to see through conflicts with-
in themselves or others, to discover
sources of motivation, release potentials,
and so increase productivity. And if
in the process some time-worn ethic
interposes a barrier, then it must be
pushed aside. Neither God nor Mam-
mon exists.
In the second year the accent falls
on “business policy,” an endless study
of case histories, discussing what went
wrong, what should have been done;
an attempt at reality in the classroom,,
the reality of the intensive application
of critical faculties by tired and haras-
sed men in the face of opposition.
There is, perhaps, not quite the inten-
sity of the 6|-day weeks of 10-hour
days which some U.S. business semi-
nars favor but, as Professor Wills
points out, he adapts the latest develop-
ments in business education to Aus-
tralia’s conditions and needs. There
are, too, the “business games” of deci-
sion-making to give practice in com-
petition and team spirit, and to expose
students to failure. But here, too, Pro-
fessor Wills’ adaptations are in evidence
and the sophisticated U.S. hybrids of
snakes-and-ladders or Monopoly are
missing. These classes in “business
policy” are joined by part-time lec-
turers from Harvard or Stanford, visit-

ing businessmen from the U.S., and the
American-orientated elite of Australian
business (the “silver-tails” who turned
from “Oxbridge” to America in the
’fifties).
Wills has not escaped criticism for
his preoccupation with American
methods but where else does one turn
in this field, except perhaps to Japan,
which could well prove a rich, if incom-
patible, study in “behavioural science.”
However, the point remains that despite
its position at the top of the business
ladder, the U.S. is not the paragon
of excellence which outsiders sometimes
make it out to be. Its domestic critics
are too aware of the scandals and
debacles which litter the U.S. business
scene to condone such praise; there is
a vague fear that the indoctrinations
of the business schools do not develop in
their students the qualities of mind for
which business and society at large have
the greatest need. The specialisation has,
after all, been going on for 60 years
and specialist schools, particularly in
such fields as management, where the
link between rules and results is so
tenuous, inevitably tend toward the
esoteric. It is not unusual now to find
a fairly average U.S. executive deliber-
ating, quite seriously and at length, on
the psychological necessity of discard-
ing the concept of the “pursuit of per-
fection,” substituting in its place the
“pursuit of excellence” a piece of
profound nonsense from which many
would return with relief to Australian
pragmatism.
Such effete refinements, together with
the sadistically intense exercises in
decision-making and the more sophisti-
cated “games,” have not yet found a
place at the University of N.S.W.
Neither has schooling in the discreet
use of the toupee, cosmetics, or the
ultra-violet lamp, a branch of practical
knowledge which has already penetrated
most strata of American public life.
Wills does admit to a care for polite-
ness, for strict observation of the sanctity
of the deadline. But as for table
manners and the rest the students
must improve themselves as they see fit.
Management science is a large, com-
plex, and an ever-changing body of new
ideas, of new and newly applied know-
ledge. Its advocates see it as a purely
practical science relative to the material
objectives of the day; as a new religion
of materialism without Marxian con-
notations. It is iconoclastic and healthily
irreverent. And yet it is soft in the
centre. It is in disagreement about its
multiple objectives, in confusion over
its motivations. But there can be little
doubt in this age of material affluence
of its importance. Along which lines it
will develop; how it will be applied,
and whether it can preserve the afflu-
ence remains to be seen. But we cannot
ignore it. In management science, as
in'so many other fields, Australia holds
a belated starting position from which
it can avoid the pitfalls which have
ensnared the innovators and, if it so
chooses, become the beneficiary of a
distilled experience.


BUSINESS
AND FINANCE
First steps on a long road
IT IS MORE an exercise in psychology
than in practical economics: the Stock-
holm agreement on creating special
drawing rights from the International
Monetary Fund goes only a fraction of
the way toward solving the world’s
liquidity problem, but at least it is a
move away from gold, and as such is a
clear warning to the speculators and
the General.
The SDRs will probably add little
more than $U.5.2000 million a year
in extra international currency to be
split up among the 107 IMF members
in proportion to their deposits with it.
(To France’s disgust, the U.S. will get
22 percent of this.) And since the total
of world reserves of gold,
and IMF drawing rights at present is
around the $U.5.73,285 million mark,
this means that the new SDRs will add
less than three percent to the amounts
of funds now available for world trade.
In addition, it is going to take a long
time before the scheme agreed to by
the group of ten (or at least by nine
of them), following the acceptance of the
principle at last September’s IMF meet-
ing, gets ratified by its members and
actually gets off the ground. Local
authorities seem to think that it could
hardly take less than a year and it will
still need an 85 percent majority in the
IMF before it can be activated. This,
however, will probably be no problem
despite France’s obstructionist approach;
his isolation at Stockholm shows that
the rest of the Common Market has
clearly lost sympathy with de Gaulle.
But this latest move, like the two-tier
gold-price system, is just a temporary
measure, a halfway house on the road
to getting rid of gold altogether as a
medium of international exchange. And
even that will not be enough to guaran-
tee order and good sense; then it will be
vital to throw out national currencies
from the international trading arena as
well. For, despite the absurdities of de
Gaulle’s desire to get back on the gold
standard, there is a lot of merit in what
he says about the unfair advantages that
the Americans get in various ways by
having their currency accepted so widely
that they do not have to pay their debts
in “real” money and can continue to
use what are really paper liabilities as
a method, among other things, of taking
over European businesses in what the
General regards as overvalued currency.
Most of the world’s leading nations
agree that gold can no longer do its
job effectively. Last week in Sydney,.
Dr. Tore Browaldh, chairman of
Sweden’s biggest bank and a member
of Sweden’s Economic Planning Board,
said that the ultimate aim should be
for the IMF to act as the central bank
for national central banks. “The link
between gold and currency should be
broken; the tie with gold is extremely
stupid.” He also takes the view that
gold speculators would be even further
hit if the U.S. removed the guaranteed
floor price of $35 an ounce for gold; at
present speculators cannot lose if they
buy gold at $35, but if the U.S. re-
fused to be a buyer or a seller at this
price, this floor would disappear.
Probably the most important feature
of the Stockholm decision is really that,
in taking this step away from gold,
the nine are not necessarily moving
into greater dependence on existing
national currencies but are creating a
situation in which it is possible to see
some prospect for a new paper money
to take gold’s place.
The effect of this move is to create
added uncertainty in the minds of
holders of gold, who are already suffer-
ing significant losses in income by choos-
ing not to hold their cash in interest-
bearing deposits, and whose already low
free-market price could well fall to
even closer the “official” price of
$U.5.35 an ounce due to a combina-
tion of increasing supplies (probably
from South Africa) and lower demand
(through the fear that the anti-gold
men may eventually win).
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that
the price to be paid for these steps
toward solving the gold problem is
going to be costly even to Aus-
tralia. For the attempts to reduce the
American payments deficit are all de-
flationary and, by reducing U.S. im-
port demand, must have an impact on
exports of the rest of the world, par-
ticularly Japan, whose role as our best
customer depends in some part on her
ability to sell to America.
So the fight to hold the dollar’s line
against gold means that the outlook
for world trade in 1968-69 could be
for difficult conditions, even though
the SDRs could help a bit in 1969.
If the world is to avoid some recessive
pressures brought on by the U.S. and
British deflations, then the reserves-
rich European countries like Germany
and France must increase their level
of economic activity to offset it, at
least to some extent. Unfortunately,
there is no indication that the tradi-
tional European fear of inflation will
allow this to happen. There is still a
big question mark over world trade.

Fruit
Down in the clumps
IT IS NOT SO surprising to learn
that Australian fruit-growers are down
in the dumps. Like all other industries
who’ve been promised compensation
for devaluation effects from the Govern-
ment (a committee is examining the
subject but has so far produced noth-
ing), it feels that the five months or
so since devaluation is a long time to
have been going on hopes of promises
given by Mr. Holt. Another big worry
is that no compensation has been re-
ceived for all those apples and pears
that went rotten in the Suez Canal last
year, the shippers having pointed to
some small print in the contracts which
let them out, at least so they thought.
However, there’s a ray of hope for the
Australian growers because some
Somaliland banana-growers in a similar
boat are presently suing shippers for
payment of compensation. This is be-
ing regarded as a test case here, and this
alone is keeping Australian growers’
hopes alive. What with Canberra’s de-
lays, the rotten fruit, and—as from April
Ist—a 2J percent increase in overseas
freight rates, things look tough.

Housing
W.A.'s new towns
ALAN BOND has moved up from sign-
writer to Perth’s biggest land developer
in such a short time that many Western
Australians regard him with suspicion.
But the fast rise has not worried British
financiers, and this young man in a
hurry has managed to tap the source of
City pounds more effectively than any-
body else in his business. He had hung
his hat so firmly on the concepts of
rising land prices that he pioneered the
precarious technique of using finance-
company money to buy up land, selling
it quickly; this is how he started operat-
ing on a big scale.
Last week, the recently renamed
Bond Corporation linked with the
prestigious British group Taylor Wood-
row Constructions Ltd. to form a joint
venture aimed at building a satellite
town, no less. They have 20,000 acres of
land, including ten miles of magnificent
oceanfront, 25 miles up the coast from
Perth near Yanchep. Before flying out
of Perth for Sydney, and further talks
with his new partner in the venture, Mr.
Lrank Taylor, Mr. Bond said he hoped
to start work on the long-term project
within six months. The eventual cost,
he said, would be several hundred mil-
lion dollars, making it even bigger than
a similar scheme floated to the south of
Perth near the industrial complex of
Qwinana, where $l5O million is to be
spent over the next fifteen years by
Landall Construction and Development
Co. Ltd. (on building a town of 10,000
houses, for 35,000 people on a 2896-
acre site owned by Bungaree Pty. Ltd.).
After having dragged its feet in the
housing field, Western Australia is ob-
viously planning to pick up lost ground
fast.
Steel surplus
Seeking markets
A STEEL PLANT is something any
country aspiring to build its inter-
national image and satisfy its own
national ego apparently must have. It
is a symbol of having one foot on the
ladder of industrial development, of a
determination to go on to better
industrial things almost regardless
of economic realism. So India, the
Philippines, New Zealand, and other
underdeveloped: countries who build
heavily subsidised steel complexes, and
put the world’s big and most efficient
steel producers like Britain, Japan, the
U.S., and ourselves in the position of
being loaded with heavy overcapa-
city in steel.
Present world steel capacity of about
150 million tons is no less than 80
million tons surplus to current con-
sumption requirements. According to
Mr. R. W. Brook, the general manager
of BHP’s new marketing division,
speaking at a Press conference in Mel-
bourne last week, the surplus is now at
its peak and can be expected to be
progressively reduced over the next ten
years, an intermediate point being
reached in 1975 when Mr. Brook
expects a world surplus of 50 million
tons.
Economic pundits have long been
saying that BHP should export more
steel to help the balance of payments,
but until recently the company has
never had a sufficiency of steel capa-
city to meet peak demands on the
domestic market, and at the same time
provide substantial quantities for
export on a permanent basis. However,
its capacity has now been expanded
to such an extent that it envisages
having persistently big supplies of steel
for export. Not that its recent export
efforts have been niggardly. Last year
it exported more than a million tons
of steel compared, say, with only
315,000 tons in 1962-63. However,
having more steel to sell overseas is
only one side of the problem. The
question is whether BHP can sell it
in a world situation where such mas-
sive overcapacity exists and exports are
so highly competitive. The company’s
first step in an all-out marketing cam-
paign is to replace its old marketing
organisation with an entirely new one
based on the latest American concep-
tions. BHP’s need to find more overseas
markets for its steel is not the only
motive behind the initiation of the
group’s new. marketing division by any
means. The old one, like a lot of things
at BHP, had grown up rather like
Alice. It was high time for a change
whose emphasis would be put on
customer requirements in place of
simply serving them with what BHP
has to offer (no change, though, in
the cash basis of all the company’s
sales and no apologies either for
not making one).
In directing its marketing more to
end users of steel, BHP is making
tacit recognition of some very tangible
realities in inter-material competition,
especially in the packaging field where,
say with Comalco’s new aluminium can
venture, which clashes directly with
BHP’s steel. BHP’s management fore-
sees this portending more attention to
the development of product image
through the various media. In the same
line of country the new organisation’s
technical services group will direct part
of its efforts toward educating its
customers in the best uses and applica-
tions of steel. It will bring to the
customer the full book of steel tech-
nology, not only in literature form but
also through the new steel laboratory
at Clayton, which is costing around
$3 million and where improving the
usage of steel and developing new pro-
ducts will be the primary concerns.


THE WEEK
BRIEFLY
For the economy : Overseas funds of gold and
foreign exchange fell to their lowest level since July, 1962 . . .
The Australian Resources Development Bank opened for
business, offering interest rates better than those offered
by the Commonwealth Government or on semi-government
loans. Mr. McEwen caused a furore with remarks on Japanese
car impy/ts. New capital expenditure by industry for the
December half appears to have shown a useful increase.
For the markets : Trading on Australian share
markets has been relatively quiet, with sellers content to
await a further influx of overseas capital, or commitment
of funds already here, to the market.
The Labor Government’s resounding defeats in four by-
elections encouraged investors in London . . . Glimpses of
peace from talk of a bombing pause in Vietnam, and hopes
that the Stockholm meeting of gold countries will make pro-
gress, elicited response on Wall Street.
For companies t In the market for borrowings, BHP
received about sloom., when it sought s4om. . . . FCA
sought up to sl2m., Mutual Acceptance up to s6m., Esanda
up to $24., and United Dominions up to s2m.
More interims rolled in for the half year to December . . .
Carlton and United lifted profit 17 percent. Minus the
brewery, R. W. Miller’s profit fell 3.7 percent after 0.7 per-
cent shrinkage in revenue. Ansett reported a 19 percent profit
fall, although revenue rose 11.5 percent. Eric Anderson re-
duced its rate of loss . . . AWA sales were maintained but
margins reduced . , . International Resistance profit was sub-
stantially lower . . . J. Gadsden’s sales rose 13 percent but
profits slipped fractionally.
Higher sugar prices knocked Life Savers’ profit, although
sales rose in the half year to January. In the seven months
to February 29 David Jones had record turnover and profit
rose accordingly.
Sydney engineer, Byrne and Davidson will raise $500,000
in a public float of 50c shares at par.
The Australia Hotel central Sydney site will be redeveloped
by MLC, the beneficial owner of 41.32 percent of the capital
(bought at $1.03 on the market); Lend Lease holds 10.87
percent . . . and rumor has it that Chevron’s Mr. Whitehouse
holds over 10 percent, too.
Main institutional subscribers to Austral-Pacific Fertilisers
Ltd. capital are MLC and the State Government Insurance
Office of Queensland. Clutha Developement has joined CRA
as a 40 percent partner in CRA’s bids for the two Blair

MEN AND
MATTERS
LOOKING' OVER BHP’s line up of
executives for its new marketing set-up
underlines the already well established
fact that the group’s wealth of ex-
perienced talent in its own ranks is the
envy of every firm in the country. It
may have had to call in American con-
sultants to make the blueprint of the
new division, but it is not just the old
sales organisation writ large. Like the
new profit centre idea BHP adopted
early last year it is a new conception in
Australia, though it is being manned
entirely by men who’ve come from long
experience in its own ranks, some as
long as 30 years, and mostly after tak-
ing degrees at Australian universities.
The new general manager of the divi-
sion who will have six managers of the
various sub-divisions under him, is Mr.
R. W. Brook who joined BHP in 1937
after graduating at Melbourne Univer-
sity. He’s been a senior sales executive
with the group for many years, has
wide overseas study of marketing under
his belt and is currently a member of
the Export Development Council.
The American consultants are still
roaming around BHP’s vast domain and
latterly have been planning changes in
Commonwealth Steel and in the
engineering steel activities. Meanwhile,
the group is building up its own in-
ternal team of consultants. This is
only a three man show at present, one
of them being a Rhodes Scholar with
a Masters degree in engineering from
Oxford. The intention is that when it
next comes round to reorganising the
group’s internal management and
marketing structures, this team will be
able to do the job. As this team in it-
self seems to be unique in Australia, it
could be an idea to give a lot of other
less efficient Australian firms a glimpse
of its procedures and also that of the
new marketing division at work. Al-
ready a few firms such as ACI and
McPherson’s have introduced profit
centres into their organisational struc-
tures on BHP’s example.
ECONOMIC RESEARCFI sounds
more like a way to pass the time at a
university than a way to make money
in the business world. But it has been a
money-maker for 40-year-old lan
Shannon, who retired this week as
managing director of the Economist
Intelligence Unit (Australia) Pty. Ltd.
(but is remaining on the board), to give
him time to follow his own interests of
providing economic advice at top levels,
particularly to governments. Shannon,
who comes from a South Australian
farming family (his 3000 bottle cellar
is heavily S.A. oriented) and was
schooled at St. Peter’s College, started
out to be a farmer, following a brief
war end spell in the navy, by doing his
R. II. Brook
Ian Shannon
Diploma in Agriculture at Roseworthy
Agricultural College, and then another
in Agricultural Economics at Oxford
before deciding that economics was
more his field and finishing up with a
B.Litt. (Oxon).
After a year in a research fellowship
at Melbourne University, looking into
problems of economic development of
under-developed countries, Shannon set
up his Bureau of Economic and Satisti-
cal Research in the mid-1950s which
linked with the Economist Intelligence
Unit (the “tail” of the Economist
magazine that now wages the dog in
profit terms) in 1960. But in recent
times Shannon has been busy on other
things, apart from running the local
EIU operation, such as writing books
on gold (he is one of the few really
strongly pro-gold economists around).


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Throwing down
the gauntlet
to Japan
BY J. C. HORSFALL
CAN WE AFFORD to throw down
the gauntlet to Japan on trade?
Wherever Mr. McEwen thinks he may
be going on trading policies, it would
seem impudent at this particular time,
and certainly impolite, to use the big
stick to whip them his way, as he did
in his off-the-cuff statements about
wheat, sugar, and beef in Parliament
last week.
His effort read the more strangely
coming out a day after the reasoned
statement of the Prime Minister in front
of the Associated Chambers of Com-
merce in Hobart, in which Mr. Gorton
spelled out the need to expand trade
with Asian countries.
Admittedly, the PM didn’t mention
Japan specifically (except to illustrate
what can be done), and seemed to be
referring more to South-East Asia. But
it may be suggested that while South-
East Asia holds a useful potential for
expanding Australian exports of manu-
factured goods it is really our trade
(and double tax) relationships with
Japan which should be engaging his
primary attention. These are vital to
the whole future of our export trade.
Compared with the potential of expand-
ing two-way trade with Japan, the pros-
pect with the South-East Asian countries
proper looks hardly propitious enough
to shout about at this moment.
It must be admitted that thus far
in the post-war period Japan has been
mighty tolerant of our efforts to expand
our exports there without a compen-
sating readiness on our part to open
our gates for Japanese goods to the
extent she desires and seems entitled to.
The tolerance, one may suggest, de-
rives, firstly, from the fact that Japan
badly wants our raw materials. In the
case of wool, she really has no choice,
and with most of the minerals, such
as coal, bauxite, and iron ore, we can
offer highly competitive terms and
secure long-term delivery for the
qualities and quantities sought. It suits
her to buy these things from us; just
as it suits her to buy other things else-
where, even if we’ve also got them to
sell.
Secondly, Japan’s liberal buying from
Australia has so far been very little
restrained by , shortage of foreign ex-
change. This is not to say that Japan
has no balance-of-payments worries
from time to time. It is simply that
Japan has not been obsessed with
bilateral equalising of trade and has,
rather, put its faith in multilateral
arrangements through which it has been
able to shop around, irrespective of its
export position with any particular
country. Also, like Australia, Japan has
been blessed with a strong inflow of
capital, mainly from the United States,
and this has greatly facilitated the
shopping-around process.
It would be very satisfactory if this
position could be sustained. Unfortu-
nately, it is unlikely to be. In the back-
ground, there are ominous signs that
world export markets are becoming
much more competitive and that some
could well shrink. One is not thinking
here merely of the intensification of
competition stemming from the de-
valuation of sterling and other cur-
rencies last year, but more of the
general effect of strained international
liquidity, Britain’s and the United
State’s efforts to balance their current
balance-of-payments accounts through
their restrictions on the export of capi-
tal, and the implicit threat of overall
weakness in world commodity prices;
of a possible world economic malaise.
Against this background, it seemed last
week that, for all his great reputation
in the economic field, Mr. McEwen
simply ignores what seems to be cook-
ing when he raps Japan over the
knuckles for not buying every blessed
thing we have on offer.
In a word, all this is in my view
going to make Japan far less tolerant
of the still huge trade gap in Aus-
tralia’s favor. Instead of berating Japan,
this seems to be the time for the
Federal Government to do something
more tangible to help bridge that gap,
and, at the same time, lift the total
volume of the two-way trade to
greater heights in the spirit of Mr.
Gorton’s advocacy.
If what is necessary to be done is
at the expense of our traditionally big-
trading partners, Britain in particular,
this would be no more than a realistic
recognition of the way the tradewinds
have been changing in recent years,
and of the way other changes, such as
Britain’s possible entry to the Common
Market, are blowing up. If what has to
be done offends against our established
lines of economic development and the
protective devices that support them,
the exercise becomes a lot harder but
is no less essential —if Mr. Gorton’s
general objective of expanding trade
with Asia is to be attained.
Although trade with Japan has in-
creased faster than with any other
country in the past five years, and on
a percentage basis Japan’s exports to
Australia have been increasing more
rapidly than ours to Japan, the surplus
in our favor last year was bigger than
in any of the five years except 1963-64.
We have to face the hard fact that
the gap will not be reduced much
unless we give Japan better trading-
opportunities in the Australian market.
The obvious way to do this is' to phase
out imperial preferences, which, over a
large range of capital goods at present,
means that while Japan has to jump a
45 to 50 percent tariff wall British
goods merely have to step over one of
percent at most, and their advantage
has, of course, been greatly increased
by sterling devaluation.
There are many other types of im-
ports for which the Japanese would like
us either to abolish or cut imperial
preferences also, but as time and time
again they have stressed that the ex-
pansion of capital goods exports to this
market is more important to them than
anything else, this is where we should
start, and it so happens that not being
a big producer of heavy capital goods,
anyway, local manufacturing industry
would be least affected.
The significance of metal manufac-
tures in Japan’s thinking about the Aus-
tralian market is well illustrated by the
fact that these comprised more than a
third of its total exports to Australia
last year; that is, $lOl million out of
$295 million (inclusive of iron and
steel, $24 million, the percentage was
44.) Metal manufactures (of which
transport equipment makes up nearly
half) have risen faster than any other
Japanese export to Australia; it has
trebled in the past four years.
When in Melbourne recently, Mr.
Kimitake Murakami, vice-president of
the Japanese External Trade Organisa-
tion, said that, even if he was satisfied
with the way Japanese cars were pene-
trating the Australian market (and so
he should be) and also with the pro-
gress of textiles, the slowness of capital
goods was a very sore point. Textiles,
which are Japan’s second biggest export
to this country, dropped back slightly
two years ago, but last year were a
record S7SJ million or about a quarter
of the total.
The only other group of exports to
exceed $lO million last year was chem-
icals. Japanese exports of these to Aus-
tralia has more than doubled in the last
four years to $22 million last year.
Judging by their further step up so far
this year, they could top $3O million for
the full year. Moreover, the recent
marketing link between the ICl-
controlled Albright and Wilson and the
Japanese Sumitomo groups is calculated
to lift Japan’s participation in the Aus-
tralian chemicals’ market still further,
particularly in dyes.
Outside metal manufactures, iron and
steel (an erratic performer from year
to year), textiles and chemicals, the
rest of Japanese exports to Australia
last year, and their progress in recent
years, were unimpressive. Almost every-
where the Japanese look there is our
mountainous tariff wall, and apparently
it looks a lot bigger to them than it
does to Mr. McEwen.


Australian mountains
of foreign ores
STRONG CRITICISM of some governmental policies, warnings of the potential
dangers of foreign investment (while recognising the need for it), and a basic factual
background to the state of the mineral development of Australia are in a book
(“Mountains of Ore,” Lansdowne, $l5), published last week by one of Australia’s
foremost geologists. He is Sir Harold Raggatt, former permanent head of the
Department of National Development and now a consultant to many leading
companies.
“The size of the foreign stake in
our minerals industry is a compound of
the unwillingness of Australians to take
the risks involved in prospecting and
to invest in mining ventures and the
fact that the size of the capital required
is beyond our means,” he says. ,
“The amount of Australian capital
that has been subscribed for the search
for oil is ridiculously small. It is
churlish not to welcome a foreign
company which is prepared to take
risks we are not prepared to take our-
selves. Sir William Spooner and I
were often embarrassed because, when
we were asked to suggest the names of
Australian companies which might be
interested in partnerships with foreign
prospectors, we usually found an un-
successful approach had already been
made to them.
“There are potential risks attached
to foreign investment in the mineral
industry. These could arise through the
objectives and policies of the foreign
company or of its home government
being in conflict with Australia’s in-
terests and objectives. It is within the
powers of Australian governments to
forestall or prevent companies acting
against the national interest.
“It is essential to emphasise the word
potential; mining companies that have
operated in Australia for many years
have always acted in the national in-
terest. For example Conzinc and Mt. Isa
Mines Ltd. have consistently adhered
to a policy of development and diver-
sification and followed it out faster
and on a larger scale than any govern-
ment would have demanded of them.
In times of world oversupply they
have always acted in Australia’s interest.
But some of the international oil com-
panies certainly have consistently re-
fused to adopt refinery practices in
accordance with out national interest.
“The potential dangers are particu-
larly that the objective of processing
and fabrication in Australia to the
maximum extent reasonably practicable
may be prejudiced by the desire of the
foreign company to obtain minerals
cheaply and in the form of raw maters
ials; it may act against the national
interest in times of financial stringency
in its home country; it will look to its
own country too readily for goods and
services.
“It is doubtful that statements sug-
gesting a reduction in foreign capital
might lead to a drop in foreign tech-
nical knowledge are true in prospect-
ing for minerals other than petroleum.
Certainly it has been and will continue
to be necessary to make use of tech-
niques and equipment developed in
other countries, but association with
foreign mining companies is not neces-
sary to ensure either access to modern
technology or ideas on prospecting. In
some respects, prospecting in Australia
by foreign geologists is more effective
than prospecting by imported geologists,
especially those unfamiliar with pros-
pecting in areas of deep sedimentary
soils.
“Australia undoubtedly needed foreign
know-how on petroleum prospecting,
and this has been a welcome by-product
of the activities of foreign oil com-
panies in Australia, but it is not essen-
tial that it continue. In development
of oil and gas fields, Australia still
needs foreign know-how, but this can
be obtained through consultants and
contractors.
“On the know-how side, there are dis-
advantages as well as advantages; the
foreign company tends to look to its
home country for scientific, economic
and technological support often with-
out knowing (and in some cases not
bothering to find out) that the services
are available in Australia.”
But Sir Harold thinks that arbitrary
methods of control of foreign invest-
ment are not likely to be effective.
Rather, we should increase our own
contribution to mineral exploration and
development, and through equity par-
ticipation seek to ensure that the
national point of view is expressed in
the board room and adopted to the
maximum extent possible.
The stock exchanges should be re-
quested to accept articles of association
preventing foreign takeovers; the new
Development Bank should help in
marshalling domestic financial re-
sources; governments should continue
their support of joint ventures and re-
duce the burden of capital investment
by providing for mining projects the
infrastructure usually provided for
by reasonable taxation treatment of
urban and pastoral development and
capital expenditure necessary on associ-
ated work in addition to developing
the mining property.
An unhappy role in uranium
SIR HAROLD is far from happy with
Australia’s present role in uranium
mining and atomic energy.
“It is high time that Australia had
a commercial scale nuclear-fuelled
power station in operation. There is
'no doubt that such a station, if built
in South Australia, would produce
electricity at an economic price. The
Commonwealth Government should
give a lead by offering to participate in
the design and construction of a nuclear
station in South Australia. It is quite
impractical to consider building a
nuclear power station in a remote part
of Australia, such as Gove, until a pro-
totype station has been built in the
industrial south, where all the skills
and engineering facilities required can
be assembled at reasonable cost.
“When the first nuclear power sta-
tions are built, they are most likely to
be located where nuclear power offers
a significant saving in cost of pro-
duction: for example in States like
South Australia where the market for
coal has been lost already. South Aus-
tralia would be wise to plan on using
nuclear power in the early future, phas-
ing out the use of its so-far limited re-
serves of natural gas for power gener-
ation and thus making gas available
for other uses to which it is suited.
“In view of the other uses to which
natural gas is uniquely suited, it would
be unwise to plan to use it over a long
period as the main fuel in an elec-
tricity generating system,
“If tbe economic life of a nuclear
power station is taken as 35 years,
approx i mate i y 32 00 short tons of
natural uranium oxide would be re _
ired tQ j the fuel f or a reactor
J roduci s sf Megawatts of electricity,
Australia’s reserves (economically recov-
eraWe at SU . S . B) are bare i y su ff ic ient
tQ meet these requ irements.”

Sir Harold re P orted to the Atomic
Ene ffy Commission in 1965 that while
wor d supply should meet projected
w ° rld den ? and o u A ntd about J 197b ’ fr T
then until 1980 demand will sub-

duction potential of 20,000 tons of
uranium must be proved,
Inquiries are now being made about
availability of uranium oxide from Aus-
tralia by a number of countries in-
eluding Japan and the U.S. If Aus-
tralia and Australian-based companies
are to benefit from these inquiries, a
vigorous renewal of prospecting for
uranium is required. There is no doubt
that prospecting will bring to light

additional reserves, but prospecting will
be undertaken only if there is a
market for the product. The only mar-
ket at present is overseas.
“The Commonw’ealth Government in
April, 1967, announced a policy allow-
ing export of uranium oxide under
rather severely restricted conditions.
“This decision w 7 as considered rather
hard on Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd.,
and the Commonwealth Government
in May agreed that the Company could
export up to 5090 short tons of uranium
made up of 1500 short tons from the
proved reserves at Mary Kathleen; 3500
short tons from additional proved re-
serves, including, when proved, the
reserves now 7 classed as possible. The
price in this, as in other export con-
tracts, must be approved by the Minis-
ter for National Development.
“There is no doubt that, in the long-
run, more ore wall be found under a
policy w 7 hich permits unrestricted trad-
ing rather than under a policy of con-
trol. Australia’s experience of embargo
or limited export of iron ore, man-
ganese and phosphorite must surely
have demonstrated the truth of that
statement. Nevertheless, the Govern-
ment was faced with a difficult situa-
tion in working out a policy which
w 7 ould encourage exploration for
uranium but not deplete known re-
sources before new 7 deposits were found
or substantial additions w 7 ere made to
know'n reserves. The Government
could scarcely have been expected to
ignore three facts: (a) that 71 percent
of our low 7 est-cost proved reserves are
in one mine (Mary Kathleen); (b)
that international trade in uranium is
subject to restrictions and hence it is
probable that, if Australia w 7 ere
obliged to buy uranium, the conditions
attached to the purchase would mean
that Australia w 7 ould lose control of its
own atomic energy program; (c) those
countries currently interested in buying
uranium are getting in early, hoping to
accumulate supplies before demand
leads to a rise in price.
“It is up to the mining companies
and individual prospectors to get busy
and prove additional reserves, but the
Commonw'ealth Government should
Sir Harold Raggatt
also give an assurance that it will, in-
sofar as international agreements per-
mit, progressively relax and ultimately
remove restrictions on exports as dis-
coveries are made; otherwise the pros-
pecting effort will be inadequate.”
Government errors
THE ROLE of governments in the
search for oil is also criticised by Sir
Harold.
“Australia is within at least 49 per-
cent sufficiency in crude oil supplies.
Whether full sufficiency will be
attained depends essentially on the
effort put into prospecting and de-
velopment.
“Governments should recognise that
prospecting is the .lifeblood of mining
and that the one motive which sustains
prospecting is the chance of success. If
the right to develop a discovery is
challenged, then prospecting will die.
“It is essential that there should be
no watering-down on the principle that
a discoverer is entitled to reap the re-
ward of his discovery. This principle
was not observed in the drafting of the
original proposals for offshore drilling
for petroleum and there are signs that
some governments are contemplating
other breaches of it.
“The normal good sense of all the
ministers concerned with the granting
of mining tenements seems to have de-
serted them in their early discussions of
the offshore drilling legislation. Which-
ever way one looks at these early pro-
posals, the key element in them can
only be regarded as outrageous.” (It
had been intended that a discoverer
should only keep 4-9ths of the prospec-
tive area of the field and should have
to bid against others for the remain-
ing. 5-9ths.)
But Sir Harold also criticised oil in-
dustry’s delegates for being “intemp-
erate in tone” and making representa-
tions not in accord wuth Australian
tradition.
“The present arrangement, allowing
a discoverer to hold all nine blocks (of
225 square miles) of a discovery, on
payment of an additional royalty, is a
compromise. If the arrangements are
universally applied (that is, if there is
no provision for some amelioration in
particular cases) some offshore fields
will remain undeveloped. For example,
if the Barrow Island discovery w 7 ell had
been drilled in 30 fathoms of water,
the fields would not have been de-
veloped, under the new 7 arrangements.
“The provisions in the mining act
dealing with holders of claims who do
not work them but hang on to them
hoping to be bought out are inadequate.
There should be provisions for auto-
matic cancellation after a specified
period, or the rent, wdiich is now nom-
inal, should be based on a sliding scale
which would rise in a continually in-
creasing significant amount from, say,
the fifth year onwards.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Are forecasts
any damn good
at all?
“ONCE IN THE dear dead days
beyond recall, an out-of-town visitor
was being shown the wonders of the
New York financial district. When the
party arrived at the Battery, one of his
guides indicated some handsome ships
riding at anchor. He said, ‘Look, those
are the bankers and brokers’ yachts.’
‘Where are the c-c-customers’ yachts?’
asked the naive visitor.”
So starts a book I came across the
other day: “Where Are The Customers’
Yachts? Or A Good Hard Look at
Wall Street.” The author, Fred Schwed,
Jnr., is a Wall Street man with a sense
of humor and a writing style to match.
An idea of the type of book he has
written is given by some of his chapter
headings: When the Bull Jumped Over
the Moon; Was It Stolen or Did You
Lose It?; Cash as a Long Term Invest-
ment.
One chapter (The Validity of Fin-
ancial Predictions) examines profes-
sional forecasts under the following
headings:—
1. Are they pretty good?
2. Are they slightly good?
3. Are they any damn good at all?
4. How do they compare with
tomorrow’s weather prediction you
read in the paper?
5. How do they compare with the
tipster horse-race services?
If you like light reading and are
interested in the Stock Exchange, its
workings, the people who work it, and
those who work for it (there is a differ-
ence you know), the Bull Market Edi-
tion of this book is recommended.
A company that looks a good buy at
the moment is Southern Cross Proper-
ties, the renowned Melbourne hoteliers
(10 restaurants and bars). The company
has just announced its interim result
(about a month ago to be precise) and
things look encouraging. Profit at
$159,800 was more than double the
$78,000 earned in the same period of
1966-67. And that’s not all. Also
announced was the cheery fact that the
present trend should continue into the
second half of the year as well. Remem-
bering that SCP’s shares are more than
usually sensitive to good news (they
went up to 30 cents last year merely
because of an amendment to the lease
a g re e m e n t with Intercontinental
Hotels), it seems likely that the an-
nouncement of a successful second half
to the current year will be enough to
make the shares jump to a price that
will make current buying worthwhile.
With this thought (and hope) in mind
I bought 5.00. Incidentally, although the
company still has $600,000 in accumu-
lated losses and is miles away from pay-
ing dividends, its 50-cent shares (now
just over half-par 26 cents) are all
backed by 39 cents worth of'assets.
Something that’s been an asset to very
few people has been the drought. How-
ever one company that should do well
out of it is Schweppes (Australia). The
company should do well all round this
year. Not only has it had the drought
out parching throats for it but it’s also
had the benefit in many areas (Sydney
being one) of an unusually clammy
March. Add to these bull points an
increase in wholesale soft-drink prices
and a large expansion program (mainly
takeovers) and the answer is—watch
Schweppes. If the interim report, which
is due out any time now, is a good one,
the company can happily be added to
any buying list.

Overpriced or underpriced?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
WAS THE MARKET overpriced in
1963, or is it underpriced now? That is
the big question emerging out of the
fascinating study of 100 leading indus-
trial stocks reported last week by Syd-
ney stockbroker Mr. M. A. Gleeson-
White to the annual conference of
trustee companies.
His study showed that the market
price of these 100 shares had fallen from
an index of 118 in 1963 to 109 by
the end of last year, despite the fact
that dividends a share had risen by 26
percent and earnings per share had risen
by 36 percent, so that the price earn-
ings ratio for this sample had fallen
from 20 times to only 15 times.
His conclusion was that these 100
leading companies were now faced with
expansionary forces that could under-
write considerably earning and capital
growth rates, and with very little down-
side risk at current prices. But there
was no case for “buying the index”; in-
vestment should remain selective, and
that to pay more than 20 times earn-
ings was a dangerous pastime.
Groups for which the market is now
paying one-third less for earnings than
in 1963 include banks, building mater-
ials, insurance companies, newspapers,
department stores, and textiles; variety
stores had lost even more ground, with
the market pricing them at 14 times
earnings against 26 times in 1963.
IT’S AN ILL WIND that blows' no-
body any good. A big typhoon in the
Philippines, supplier of 60 percent of
the world’s copra last year has created
a shortage which is having its effect
on prices and should bring at least
short-term benefits to New Guinea
copra plantations. The price payable in
Sydney by Australian buyers for New
Guinea copra has risen from $217.04
per ton in January to $226.08 in April,
and compares with under $lBO a ton for
hot air dried copra payable up to
October last year.
Island traders and planters like
W. R. Carpenter, Burns Philp, and
Steamship Trading are the beneficiaries,
although, if prices get too high, there is
always a danger of users being encour-
aged to employ substitutes. As coconuts
take about ten months to set on the
tree, the Philippines shortage may con-
tinue, with high prices on world
markets, for months into the current
calendar year.
On that basis, with coffee and cocoa
prices quite healthy, there are clear
attractions in Steamship Trading,
whose supporters on the market are still
rallying from the solid two-for-five par
issue last June, and disapointment at
receiving ten percent instead of the
usual 13 l-3rd percent dividend. New-
comers to the stock should see an up-
trend in the company’s fortunes from
this point. After hovering round par,
the shares are currently 57c,
8.8 percent on divided (last year 10
percent was paid from earning rate of
18.6 percent) and 16.2 percent on
earnings.
W. R. Carpenter recently reported a.
13 percent lift in profits for the Decem-
ber half after last year’s setback which
was the first in 23 years. Steamship: is
yet to report on the half-year. The
company is in an expansionist mood;
it has recently announced the erection
of a multi-storey building in Port
Moresby.
THE GLOOMY predictions by one
Melbourne chartist on Pioneer Con-
crete that were mentioned here last
week have been followed by what seems
to be a realistic market rise in view of
its pretty good interim report. The ex-
pectations of a steady earning rate on
higher capital (despite the drought’s
impact on the wholesale and rural
divisions of the F. W. Williams sub-
sidiaries) show that there must have
been marked improvement in its other
operations, particularly concrete and
quarries. And the result shows clearly
the distinction between the fortunes of
producers of cement and suppliers of
concrete.
Things do look tough for the cement
end of the business, as APCM’s pre-tax
profit fell 8 percent, although sales were
only 1 percent lower. A price rise in
February, 1967, was supposed to cor-
rect the erosion of margins experienced
in recent times. And the nation’s largest
cement maker, A. and K. Cement, also
had slightly lower sales in the six
months to November, but managed to
increase profit marginally. Demand for
cement in Victoria and N.S.W. was
again not at the level experienced two-
years ago. ’
But it seems that changes in con-
The Chartist says:
PEKO-WALLSEND INVESTMENTS was originally recommended in June, 1967,
at $2.71 when a minimum probable target of $3.80 was suggested. It has again
been reproduced to illustrate a classic example of a long-term trendline study still
with potential of considerable capital appreciation. From 1961 prices moved in a
broad uptrend channel at a basic rate of 20 percent appreciation per annum.
The intermediate swings moved at a higher rate and it can readily be seen that
the breakout from the consolidation pattern formed during the 1966/7 area of
trading was the start of an uptrend at an outstanding rate of appreciation close
to 500 percent per annum, which it is still holding at present. Investors can
continue to hold this stock quite safely, particularly whilst it is still in the trend
channel, which was again confirmed this current week. There is a possibility of
a short-term target of approximately $14.00 and the overall pattern suggests a
“measured move” condition to $20.00. Last sale price on 28/3/68 $lO.OO.

tractual marketing arrangements (RMG
and Goliath, for instance) have appar-
ently been more to the advantage of
concrete firms than cement makers, and
there is no suggestion that cement’s
problems are flowing into the concrete
business, whose only links are as con-
sumers. The yields offering on Pioneer
shares, 5.2 percent on income, 9.7 per-
cent on earnings, look rather more
attractive than the cement makers,
APCM’s 4.8 percent and 7.1 percent,
and A and K Cement’s 4.0 percent.
ALL THIS interest in oil drilling (our
oil table now fills a page on its own)
means that, at last, our 1967 recom-
mendation for Oil Drilling and Ex-
ploration might come good. Following
last year’s 41 percent profit fall, we
suggested things should improve for
‘ODE, even though at that time there
was mounting activity offshore rather
than on land, where ODE was mainly
occupied. Nevertheless, it has a two-
fifths stake in the Zapata offshore rig.
ODE is doing an increasing amount
of onshore work, with four new wells
dor the Alliance group in Queensland
and three in the Amadeus basin likely
to go most of the way toward sustain-
ing the high rate of activity in the first
half of the current financial year when
development drilling at Moonie, Al-
ton, and Barrow Island, increasing
activity by Santos and the Ashmore
Reef drilling all combined to give the
company a greater interim profit than
was earned in the whole of last year.
OIL SPECULATORS began the year
with three big hopes outside the Bass
Strait area —Ashmore Reef, Capricorn
off Queensland, and the Phillips well
-off the Papuan coast. None have come
good, although the Phillips well gives
every indication of being on a worth-
while structure, with further testing
of it having to wait until the end of
the windy season, which will not be until
late this year. So now the offshore
search is well and truly centred in Bass
Strait again, where BHP’s latest oil-
field discovery did little to move the
market despite what could be a major
addition to the recently upgraded po-
tential of the area.
The investor who spent his hundreds
of thousands of dollars buying six-
month call options in BHP in a spree
which began last November has only
a month or so left before the first ones
fall due—and the shares must move
to about $2O before he breaks even.
But are there still chances of finding
oil outside Bass Strait, despite the re-
cent failures? Sir Harold Raggatt thinks
so. (And so does the Alliance group,
whose Bonaparte Gulf well could be
exciting later this year.) In a book
published last week (and reviewed on
page 46 of this issue), Sir Harold
laments that more local money is not
being spent looking for oil.
Sir Harold has always been a keen
supporter of the search in New Guinea.
He says the geology of Papua-New
Guinea and especially Papua meets
all the basic requirements of an oil-
producing country, and in addition
there are numerous seepages which
attest the presence of oil in Cretaceous
and Miocene rocks. Despite the failure
of the search so far (apart from estab-
lishing massive reserves of natural gas)
Raggatt still has faith: “Extensive
though it was, the prospecting work
that was done did not by any means
test all the oil bearing environments
in Papua-New Guinea.”
The discovery of the Barrow field
has enhanced, not reduced, the pros-
pects for further discoveries. There are
few, if any, experienced petroleum
geologists who would not agree that
large quantities of hydrocarbons must
have been generated in the Mesozoic
sediments beneath and offshore from
the north-west coast of Australia. There
is every reason to hope therefore that if
a combination of good reservoir-rock
and structure can be found the pros-
pects for bringing in a high-yielding
field are good. On the mainland, test-
ing of structures in the Palaeozoic rocks
is still a worthwhile objective.

Temporary pattern
of market prices?
MONEY IS IN such easy supply at
the moment that you have to go back
to 1951 for the nearest parallel for
such conditions at this time of the
year when it is traditionally at a
premium. For, once in a while, we
have a situation in which even the
coming heavy seasonal drain of money
to the Treasury seems unlikely to have
a disconcerting effect on liquidity.
The genesis of much of this flush
liquidity is mostly ascribed to the in-
flow of hot money from abroad for
portfolio investment; though it seems
equally certain that the liberal lending
policies of the banks over the past year
(following the Reserve Bank’s lead)
and the further big rise in Govern-
ment spending have been contributory
sources from inside the economy.
In its latest “Economic Review,” the
Commercial Bank of Australia has
some searching things to say about the
overseas contribution. It suggests that,
though a lot of it takes on the charac-
ter of portfolio investment, “in some
cases the intentions of its owners may
be for only a temporary investment in
Australia,” and points to some inherent
dangers in the situation for the balance
of payments, and to possible effects on
the various classes of investments.
“It is probably true,” the bank
states, “that large equity buyers con-
centrate on market leaders and this
policy no doubt gives the market value
of shares in leading companies a com-
parative price advantage over shares
in smaller companies. This may even be
extended to a general market advantge
including, for example, the issue of
fixed-interest securities. The Australian
market is still so small by comparison
with the resources of overseas investors
that equity values appear to be very
sensitive to the movement of overseas
capital.”
In other words, the bank is saying
that the pattern of market prices has
been warped by the heightening of
overseas interest.
What happens to the pattern in the
event of wholesale withdrawal (or
something less) of overseas interest as
gloomily suggested by the CBA?
On the face of it minerals would be
cut to size, but there’s more steam
behind them than meets the eye, per-
haps. At lower prices local interests
could take over the running in them
and, anyway, following the adage of
being on a good thing and sticking to
it, overseas holders are not going to
leave off in a day, especially as Mr.
Jenkins is letting them put more in.
Even if some industrial leaders could
suffer, and yield relationships be distri-
buted to the detriment of secondary
stocks, the latter would hardly face
a catastrophe because they’ve been
singularly neglected for so long.
In the meantime, nobody seems to
be scurrying away from the market
even though people are getting a lot
of advice from various quarters to
get more liquid as if there wasn’t
enough of that stuff about already.
On the other hand, piles of overseas
money look to have evaded the market
proper and are finding homes, tempor-
ary and otherwise, elsewhere: say in the
BHP debenture issue (if lucky
enough); in the short-term money mar-
ket (now holding some $575 million
or so); in Treasury Notes (say $7OO
million) and in finance companies.
IT HAS TAKEN General Credits
shareholders a long time since the
CBA made its one-for-three offer for
the shares (57 percent of the total),
which it didn’t hold, to get to a
crescendo of protest about it. But with
the Australian Shareholders Associa-
tion now taking up their cause, it may
be that their stream of letters to the
dailies will not have been in vain.
The bank’s position is an odd one be-
cause it seems entirely due to the
efforts of one of its chief inspectors,
Mr. Don McComish (who retires in
a few months) that outside shareholders
have seen their investment in General
Credits lifted from the slough in 1961
to a state of absolute health and a
most promising future (more promis-
ing, it could be said, than that of any
stately bank share).
SOME OF THE “down but not out”
counters in the market have been show-
ing rather better form for their holders
lately. For instance, nicer things have
been happening to the likes of Pelaco,
Second Century,. Alan Coffey, Tarax,
and now Federal Hotels, which has
been casting around for buys on its own
account, as for Hotel Holdings, which
owns the Hotel Australia in Adelaide.
But the smoke behind the flare-up in
the shares last week wasn’t coming
from a takeover direction, however,
but from people hopeful that the com-
pany will be successful in its applica-
tion for a casino licence in Tasmania
which will be dealt with by the State
Government this week. The group
says it sees great possibilities in an
associated hotel development. What
success would do for its profits
is anybody’s guess at this stage of the
race. Profit for the half year to Decem-
ber last dropped from a comparable
$167,984 to $136,000, which seems to
rule out any chance of the resumption
of dividends (the latest of these was
2-J percent in 1965-66) as last year
earnings were a mere 1.9 percent follow-
ing 5.1 and 4.0 percent in the two pre-
vious years. The only ray of hope in
the latest result was that the tax
provision was only $15,000 short of
the declared net profit for the six
months, though the group’s liquidity
appears to be in fair shape when it
can offer $372,000 in cash for Hotel
Holdings ($1.55 for each $2 share).


Security analysis
Pulling its weight in transport
AUSTRALIA HAS about 60,000 miles
of main roads, and another 60,000 miles
of secondary and lesser roads; there is
also a further 430,000 miles of “roads,”
mostly only formed or cleared.
These roads are used to haul about
78 percent of the estimated domestic
freight transported in Australia
measured in tons carried other modes
of transport represent respectively 18
percent in the case of the railways, four
percent for sea transport, and 0.001
percent for air transport. Another set
of statistics compiled by the Depart-
ment of Shipping and Transport in
terms of ton-miles performed put the
road transport share of the equation
at 21 percent, with sea transport at 55
percent, rail transport at 23 percent,
and air transport at 0.008 percent.
Whilst there is a considerable over-
lapping and duplication between the
various modes of transport, they can
also in many ways complement one
another. This is where the national
freight forwarders have a place in the
sun. Companies such as TNT/Alltrans,
Mayne Nickless, F. H. Stephens,
Brambles, Ansett, to name the largest
operators, are able to offer co-ordinated
services in areas such as rail-road, sea-
rail-road, sea-road, air-road, and other
combinations as well as the traditional
road line haul operations.
Only about 2 percent of the 600,000
or so motor trucks in working order in
Australia are engaged in interstate trade,
but they are estimated to account for
about 25 percent of the total road freight
business in terms of ton miles per-
formed. About half of the vehicles
engaged on a for-hire or contract basis
in interstate trade confine themselves to
the Sydney/Melbourne route, and this
trade is mainly dominated by the major
freight forwarders, with sub-contractor
owner/drivers engaged on a regular
basis operating their vehicles in the
colors of their principals. The large
national freight forwarders with a
greater aggregation of transport volumes
available to them and with the diverse
types of traffic offering have more
economic advantages to “blend” dense
and bulky goods on their highway
vehicles, so as to secure the most
profitable revenue return commensurate
with the allowable weight payload per-
mitted by the government authorities.
Since the unification of the Sydney/
Melbourne rail link in 1963, the freight
forwarders have taken control of a
growing proportion of the total railway
freight business in Australia. The rail-
ways are keen to “wholesale” their
capacity to freight forwarders on a
wagon load basis, at rates offering heavy
incentives to secure the maximum utili-
sation of the weight capacity of the
wagons. Some of this freight is being
tranported by “piggyback” methods
(highway trailers minus their prime
movers on flat rail cars) and also by the
use of containers on flat rail cars. The
introduction of roll-on/roll-off ferry
ships between Tasmania and Melbourne
and Tasmania and Sydney over the past
few years has also boosted the role of
the freight forwarders in the transport
economy. A new roll-on/roll-off ferry
service will be inaugurated between
Australia and New Zealand in late
1968 and between Melbourne and Bris-
bane in 1969. A new dimension expand-
ing the influence of the freight for-
warders still further is expected to
come with the introduction of specialised
ships entirely devoted to containerised
cargoes which will operate on the U.K./
Australia, and Japan/Australia trades in
early 1969. The freight forwarders could
become the focal point in consolidating
small shipments into standard containers
for export and in providing a service to
the overseas sea container companies for
the breaking-up of import containers
into their respective shipping lots, and
for their delivery throughout Australia.
F. H. Stephens as a company entity
dates back to 1883, when Mr. W. S.
Bell launched a small shipping and
Customs agency business in Launceston
(Tasmania). In 1901, Mr. F. H.
Stephens joined Bell, and on the
/latter’s death in 1910 assumed full
ownership of the business. In 1961,
F. H. Stephens (Consolidated)
Limited was formed and the company
was publicly listed; since that time
total assets, net earnings, and company
employment have more than doubled.
D. R. Stephens, the son of F. H.
Stephens and now in his mid-50s, is
chairman and managing director, and
although the Stephens family and close
business contacts control a substantial
part of the. public company’s equity,
this is no “one-man band” operation,
as is frequently the case in the Aus-
tralian transport industry.
Group employment is approximately
2000 and the company has in the
vicinity of 900 vehicles, which it owns
outright, as well as using sub-contractor
owner/drivers on interstate line
haulage work. The company operates
22 main offices spread through all Aus-
tralian States, and outside the capital
cities branch offices are located at
Newcastle (N.S.W.), Rockhampton
and Townsville (Queensland), Laun-
ceston, Burnie, and Devonport (Tas-
mania). Tasmania was the original
focal point of the company’s operations
and is still important today, for it cur-
rently would represent about 20 per-
cent of the group annual net earnings.
Activities in Tasmania include intra-
state transport, furniture removals,
heavy haulage, freight forwarding to
the mainland, as well as acting as a
wholesale agent for national marketing
companies within the State.
On the Australian mainland, F. H.
Stephens ranks No. 3 in the industry
in the interstate road haulage of dry
goods and No. 2 in the list of national
road/rail/sea freight forwarders. On
an Australia-wide basis, group activities
include Customs clearing, storage and
warehousing, metropolitan deliveries,
and ship agency services. Stephens are
the managing agents in Australia for
the Karlander Line, which bases in Lae
(New Guinea) and operates four
modern freighters connecting Mel-
bourne, Sydney, and Brisbane with New
Guinea ports. They are also the man-
aging agents for a shipping service con-
necting Noumea with Sydney, and
which also services Lord Howe Island
and Norfolk Island.
F. H. Stephens is one of three trans-
port companies which hire, on an
annual basis, a special type of railway
rolling stock for services between Syd-
ney and Melbourne. These rail trucks
move containers, many of which can be
loaded by shippers and delivered direct
to consignees’ premises. These con-
tracts were arranged in 1967. The
take-over in July, 1967, of Taylor-
Dalton Freight Lines Pty. Limited, a
medium-sized company in interstate
line haulage, has assisted the Stephens
group in securing a larger aggregation
of traffic from which to put together
more profitable combinations of freight
traffic and the acquisition should assist
in building group profitability. The.
company statistics are:

Over the four years 1963-67 assets
increased by 1.83 times, a fractionally

of 1.63 times in net earnings over the
same period.
Since listing in 1961, there have been
two issues to the public—l 964 an issue
of 1:4 and in late 1967 a cash issue and
a bonus issue both in the ratio of 1:10.
An interim dividend of 3 cents (un-
changed on the 1967 rate) will be paid
this month.
As a pioneer in shipping containerisa-
tion on the Australian coast in the early
19305, the company has a long-standing
history of expertise in co-ordinating sea-
road freight forwarding, and we can
anticipate a considerable increase in
overall business to develop as overseas
container ships commence in 1969 to
link Australia with the rest of the world.
At $1.45, the shares show a current
yield of 4.1 percent and the price earn-
ings ratio on the new enlarged capital
is 13.1. This is a very sound stock.


HOW TO PROFIT
FROM OPTIONS
If a share you are interested in
seems due for a rise then a Call
Option is the way to take advan-
tage of this situation. For a limited
outlay, that you know in advance,
you are in a position to profit from
your stand in the market. If you
are wrong and the share does not
rise as expected, or even falls in
value, you are not committed to
buy the share—you merely take no
further action. An Option is an
option not an agreement to
buy stock. This point and many

Recovery in the meat trade
THE STOCKMARKET does not seem
to think so, but things are looking up
at last for N.S.W. meat companies, all
of which had such a disastrous time last
year because of the drought. True, there
are still such basic problems facing the
industry as the existence of too many
wholesalers; mounting competition from
the chain stores on the retail butcher
who is the trade’s outlet, and because
the chains are doing more of their own
wholesaling; the greater production of
alternative types of meats, particularly
chicken; and a consumer resistance to
red meat that built up during the
drought-induced period of very high
meat prices.
But there are clear signs of improve-
ment, at least for those companies not
affected by the drought that is cur-
rently hitting southern parts of Aus-
tralia. Evidence of this is in the ten
percent rise in carcass meat production
in N.S.W. in the December half-year
compared with the same period of
1966-67 (and compared with an
Australia-wide rise of about eight per-
cent which has brought a lift in Aus-
tralian apparent meat consumption from
-89.71b. to 97.31 b. per capita, suggesting
a recovery in meat-eating to the pre-
drought levels of 1964-65).
The drought had first affected the
Hunter Valley and northern N.S.W.
and southern Queensland, the. main
source of supplies for F. J. Walker Ltd.,
at the end of 1965. When rain did
eventually bring relief, graziers sensibly
sowed wheat for quick cash reimburse-
ments, rather than competing to buy
store cattle, so neglecting the production
of livestock to the detriment of the
meat trade. So, after a good year, during
the drought when forced sales by
graziers increased its throughput to
modest prices, F. J. Walker (like other
wholesalers) suffered severely when the
good season came again and farmers
preferred to restock rather than sell for
slaughter.
In the northern areas served by F. J.
Walker’s abattoir at Aberdeen, there is
plenty of grass, so graziers are still
reluctant to market their cattle. The
abattoir, modernised and expanded in
recent years at a cost of over $500,000,
is still not working at anything like
capacity, maybe only 70 percent. But
restocking cannot go on for much longer
at this rate before supplies to abattoirs
improve.
In 1966-67 F. J. Walker complained
of southern buyers moving into north-
ern N.S.W. and even southern Queens-
land for supplies. But now it seems
that the continued drought in the south
has caused distressed selling and
heavy slaughtering in drought areas.
Plenty of beef is available on the Syd-
ney market, and it is generally a lot
cheaper than it has been for some time.
(The retail price has fallen since the
end of December.)
In any event, all this has meant that
F. J. Walker Ltd. this month reported
considerably higher profits for the
December half year and a margin over
the interim dividend commitment of
6J percent (tvhich last year’s profit
had failed to cover). Sales increased
satisfactorily, particularly in the
export departments, according to the
interim communique. The shares have
since moved up some 10c.
The 1966 profit was a 33 percent
improvement on two years before, and
earning rate a satisfactory 16.2 per-
cent, but the 54 percent profit slump in
the year to June 30, 1967, meant draw-
ing on reserves to maintain the
percent dividend rate established after
the three-for-ten bonus in 1956 (varied
to 15 percent in 1960).
The same improving trend is evident
through the industry. T. A. Field
achieved considerable improvement in
group results, and Conkey would have
presumably had a much better show-
ing were it not providing for establish-
ment costs of a new pastoral property,
which allowed turnover and profits to
be just maintained. Berrima District
Meat had considerable improvement in
sales and profits in the December half,
and said meat marketing conditions
(both local and overseas) showed
favorable signs. Tancred is yet to report
for the December half, after last year’s
loss of $77,000, but an improved result
is expected.
To some extent, these better results
are due to some once-and-for-all bene-
fits to meat companies that have offset
the problems they are continuing to
face of graziers’ reluctance to market
their stock. These benefits were in
devaluation profits involved in ship-
ments on the water to British markets
on which there was forward exchange
cover but which rose in price to offset
the devaluation as well, and further
price rises in Britain because of the
temporary ban on Argentinian meat
(now lifted) for fear of foot and mouth
disease.
But these may not have been of
major significance to F. J. Walker,
which is basically a supplier to the
domestic market. The export percent-
age has increased from perhaps ten to
15 percent of its business and will
increase faster following last month’s
purchase of the Byron Bay meatworks
of Anderson Meat Industries Ltd.
(receiver appointed) for $650,000 cash,
together with 700 acres of freehold for
livestock holding purposes. The works
are registered for export, and the com-
pany intends to operate on a year-round
basis, drawing pigs and dairy-type
cattle from the north coast dairy areas.
This lean, low-grade beef is suitable for
hamburger meat and smallgoods pro-
duction on the U.S. market. America
imposed a scale for Australian imports,
and as our exports are still below this
level Australia is virtually free to sell
there all of this grade of meat avail-
able.
In 1966-67 Australian meat exports
were 55 percent to U.S., 18 .percent
to the U.K., and 10 percent to Japan.
The Japanese consumed only 121 b.
per capita in 1963, showing the im-
mense scope for further beef exports,
but at present it imposes a quota of
a very limited tonnage (15,000 tons)
of Australian beef.
But despite the export potential at
Byron Bay, many meat industry people
consider that Walker’s could have
problems with this new acquisition
which has a limited area to draw on,
particularly in view of Queensland’s
cattle tick situation. Management will
need to show a great deal of skill in
handling this operation. But the out-
look is better from its other works at
Aberdeen, where, to comply with De-
partment of Primary Industry and U.S.
standards, and to increase the capacity
of the works, F. J. Walker has spent
considerable sums. A new beef killing
floor with on-the-rail facilities and by-
product departments were put in dur-

ing 1964-65, and since then new offal
packing rooms built and automatic
feeding of melters installed. Early in
1967 a new pig and calf slaughtering
unit was completed, and further work
is to be done on chillers and improve-
ments to the power supply. Full bene-
fits will not be obtained from this
considerable capital expenditure,
financed internally, until livestock is
available for slaughter in greater num-
bers. Higher wage costs, basic wage
rises, greater superannuation and holi-
day pay mean the company has to
improve margins and/or throughput to
absorb the added costs successfully.
One feature of F. J. Walker is its
diversification. It has Waterside Cold
Stores at Pyrmont (it plans to expand
boning and processing operations in
the area, and would like to consolidate
more Sydney operations here to reduce
transport and overhead costs); a wool
processing company at Botany engaged
in scouring and fell mongering, treat-
ing its own and customers’ sheepskins;
two smallgoods and bacon factories,
Oldham Bros, in Newcastle and Sil-
vester Bros, in Sydney; about 35 retail
shops throughout N.S.W., and 2000
acres at Aberdeen on which to fatten
cattle for six months.
A move into the poultry business by
purchase of 50 percent of Mountain
View Holdings Pty., a poultry raising
and processing company in the New-
castle area, was not so successful. The
initial cost was about $BO,OOO, and
capacity was doubled in 1965-66. But
by 1966-67 the company acknowledged
its difficulties by providing for losses
of $50,000, decreasing reserves by this
amount. Some poultry was even being
sold below production costs. The
position is still grim, but better than
last year. Mountain View is switching
from selling poultry with feet to selling
poultry without feet, and old stock is
being cleared out. F. J. Walker is now
reasonably happy about prospects.
Walker’s 1967 accounts showed a sum
of $462,000 owing in respect of sale
of a city property (included amongst
other debtors), which was paid in
December providing the funds for the
Byron Bay meatworks purchase. The
company’s finances emerged from a
difficult period in good shape. Over-
drafts were up from $lBO,OOO to
$440,000 (reasonable in view of the
coming proceeds of the property sale),
and creditors were down. There was
no resort to any other borrowings.
Stocks were slightly lower at $1 mil-
lion, and debtors were only slightly
up from $1.07 to $1.16 million. Further
land at Auburn is yet to be liquidated.
Capital expenditure has apparently
given the company investment allow-
ances, for tax provision has looked
rather light recently compared with
declared profits. A conservative divi-
dend policy, says the company, has
allowed accumulation of $2.5 million

Mining
The strength of foreign stakes
IS OVERSEAS ownership of the Aus-
tralian mining industry growing or dim-
inishing? The figures released by the
Commonwealth Statistician show that
in terms of value of production, over-
seas-controlled interests accounted for
33.7 percent of the total Australian
mineral production in 1965, an increase
of one-quarter over the 1963 figure of
26.7 percent. And although there are
as yet no figures for later years, it
seems very likely that during the past
two years the overseas-controlled pro-
portion of our mineral output would
have increased even further, as this
period has seen the commencement of
mining by ventures like the foreign-
dominated Savage River iron-ore pellet-
ising operation and initial production
from the Leslie Salt Company’s Port
Hedland salt project. In a few years the
resumption of production by Mary
.Kathleen Uranium (of either uranium
or rare earths) will add to the overseas
component, as well the production from
ventures such as Bougainville Copper
Pty. Ltd. (a subsidiary of Conzinc Rio-
tinto, itself 85 percent owned by the
U.K. Riotinto Zinc Corporation) and
the Macarthur River deposit of Mount
Isa Mines (a subsidiary of the Ameri-
can Smelting and Refining Company).
There are, too, considerable increases
expected in production from overseas-
weighted companies like Hamersley
Holdings, Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Pty.
Ltd. and Mount Isa Mines.
But while there has been an increase
in the overall foreign component of
mineral production, there has at the
same time been an increase in the local
content of many mineral ventures. The
figures compiled by the Commonwealth
Statistician do not cover the issue
to local shareholders of a ten percent
interest in Hamersley Holdings, nor the
commencement of shipments of man-
ganese from Groote Eylandt, by BHP,
nor the huge increase in the value of
production by King Island Scheelite
from the high wolfram prices of the
past two years. There was also the
Mount Isa strike and its aftermath, all
of which went to diminish the overseas
component vis a vis the locally con-
trolled portion of mineral output. (Con-
trol in this context meaning 25 percent
or more of voting power rather than
direct participation in management.)
In the next few years there could
well be a significant swing in the other
direction, with the local portion of
mineral production increasing at a
faster rate than that “controlled” by
overseas interests. (The term “foreign”
hardly seems appropriate when speak-
ing of Britons and Americans who to-
gether made up over 90 percent of non-
resident shareholders in 1965.) The
CRA group, which includes Hamersley,
had a total income last year of $ll4
million a goodly portion of the At*s-
tralian total, and CRA’s local share-
holding has grown from ten percent to
15 percent. The Mount Newman Iron
Ore Syndicate, which is 60 percent
owned by locals (BHP has 30 percent,
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company
20 percent, and local banks and insti-
tutions ten percent), has yet to come
into operation and is still the holder
of the biggest iron-ore export contract,
worth $6O million a year when ship-
ments reach over seven million tons in
1972. Western Mining’s nickel output
will be worth over $2O million by 1970,
and this sum will be added to the local
portion of total mineral output, as will
be the increases in production coming
from companies like Consolidated
Rutile, Western Titanium, and Peko-
Wallsend. Other locally controlled pro-
jects yet to commence production in-
clude Cleveland Tin, Great Bouldei',
EZ Industries’ Beltana zinc mine, and,
of course, Broken Hill South’s phos-
phate deposits. The contributions from
Mount Newman and Western Mining
by themselves should allow the local
component to at least hold its own, as
growth in those areas which have been
particularly attractive to overseas in-
vestors, in the past few years, such as
iron ore and coal, is not expected
to be maintained at the rates achieved
in recent years.
Many of the overseas-initiated ven-
tures which have started in the past few
years have been in areas where there
has been no local interest anyway, and
some of these mineral ventures have
been innovations on the local scene,
coming too soon to be attractive to
local investors who have only recently
begun to realise the potential of the
mining industry as an investment rather
than a speculation. The results of this
can be seen from a comparison between
the listed companies having a large
overseas interest and those which have
only a small list of overseas share-
holders. It is the overseas-controlled
companies which have shown the most
energy in exploration and expansion
of production, .and it has been largely
in these companies that our mining
industry boom has had its base. Looking
down stock exchange lists it is apparent
that companies such as Consolidated
Goldfields, Conzinc Riotinto, Hamers-
ley, Mount Isa, and Renison have been
in the vanguard of the mining de-
velopers, while companies with small
overseas affiliations have been carried
along by the tide of events with the
notable exception of Broken Hill South
and Western Mining.
Of course there are good reasons for
this; the money required to support
large exploration and development pro-
grams has to come from somewhere, and
if it is not available here then the entry
of wealthy overseas interests is hardly
surprising. All this can perhaps give
the investor an edge in selecting the
companies most likely to keep up the
pace of development, and there have
been some remarkable rewards won by
those who chose to buy shares like
Associated Minerals subsequent to Con-
solidated Goldfields’ purchase ($2.10)
of a major shareholding; or Mount
Lyell after Goldfields took up an inter-
est in this company, too (at 65 cents a
share). The performance, at least on
the share markets, of the overseas-
controlled companies has been obviously
better than those without overseas
parents. Even Western Mining and
Thiess Holding both experienced their
biggest market popularity after over-
seas groups took an interest in their
respective developments. (Selection
Trust of England buying a ten percent
equity interest in WMC on the market
when the prices for these shares were
less than $lO, and Peabody Coal, of
the U.S.A., together with Mitsui, of
Japan, taking up shares in the joint
company formed to develop Tbiess’
vast coal deposits at Moura in Queens-
land.)
On a more mundane level there are
good reasons for the better market per-
formance of such companies quite apart
from the apparently greater energy with
which they pursue their business. Con-
trast the local shareholding of less than
12 million shares in CRA (out of the
79.4 million issued) with the 36 million
shares in EZ Industries, which has a
fairly minor list of overseas share-
holders. Or the publicly held 1.7 mil-
lion shares in Associated Minerals (out
of a total of 4.5 million shares) with
the 5.7 million publicly held shares of
Western Titanium. One of the best
examples of the scarcity caused by
equity interests held by “big brothers”
is that of Mary Kathleen Uranium.
Of the 5.68 million shares issued, Con-
zinc Riotinto holds 51 percent and
Kathleen Investments hold 35 percent,
the McConachy Syndicate hold nine
percent, leaving less than 300,000 shares
available to supply share market
demand. Of Hamersley’s 100 million
shares issued, there are only ten mil-
lion available to the public, and
although this may seem a goodly
number, it is far less than the issued
capitals of many of our major industrial
companies. The leverage which this
scarcity factor provides can be con-
siderable, especially in times of high
demand for the shares in question.
There is good reason to get. with the
strength.

Considering the malevolent overseas influences, Australian
stockmarkets survived the Ides of March well. The Melbourne
metals index rose to its second highest point ever, and the many
drilling programs revived interest in oils. CRA picked up 80c
on Widgiemooltha news, and BHP gained 45c with its Perch
success. KIS lost 9Qc on tungsten price weakness. Federal Hotels
was heavily traded for a variety of reasons, all speculative.
Marrickville hit a record low of 74c. Right trading gave cheap

THE LAND
Educating the farmer
RURAL ECONOMISTS can really
lay it on the line when they want
to. So one rural extension body, the
Yass Valley Organisation, probably
just had to swallow hard as Mr. R. E.
Cooke-Yarborough, of the Bank of
New South Wales, told it that farmers
protesting about their debt situation
were merely “crying wolf.” Once again
the blessed argument from averages
provided Mr. Cooke-Yarborough with
fiis backing; he surely would be able
to admit that genuine fear of a debt
load is crippling many individual
farmers and holding them back from
necessary innovation.
The general economic attack must
by now sound rather familiar. Un-
doubtedly country land values (as a
whole) are increasing fairly rapidly.
This position therefore furnishes a
widening credit ! base on which to
borrow. More finance aids the recog-
nised drive toward lifting productivity.
As Mr. Cooke-Yarborough succinctly
puts it: “Higher land values are an
important business asset even for the
farmer not selling out.” How far such
a view accords with farmer psychology
at the present moment is another
matter. Over large areas the principal
worry must be basic replacement- and
not a happy expansiveness. New debt
doesn’t necessarily mean fresh pro-
gress.
Nevertheless, the Yass diatribe had
one very important side—the speaker’s
Insistence on farmers developing a
more acute business sense. “The more
expensive an asset the higher must be
the earnings from it to justify having
it,” Mr. Cooke-Yarborough explained.
“The implication of land valuation is
that landholders must apply business
techniques to the operation of enter-
prises on the land. The whole enter-
prise should be operated against a
budget which set out a full schedule
of activities.”
Admittedly, many farms are run just
like that. Woolgrowers generally, for
instance, may be cited as a distinctly
efficient branch of farming activity.
Equally, very many farmers still be-
lieve that all their emphasis should be
on just growing things; luck, or the
State, will then provide. The in-
adequacy of this attitude leaves large
areas of rural industry utterly defence-
less before the infamous, yet unavoid-
able, cost-price squeeze.
J3ut one corollary of a call for
greater business method among the
farming community is the obvious need
to give farmers a good deal more
training in management and in the
economic aspects of their craft. Effi-
ciency does not only arise from
application of the latest technical and
research results. Indeed, these very
features demand extra skills of manage-
ment and some economic flair for
proper success. A discernible trend has
clearly been an increasing reliance
upon consultants and extension services
for this kind of expertise. The Vernon
Report piously hoped for considerable
growth as has occurred is sufficient,
sion aids. It is now a pretty and
pertinent question whether such
growth as has occurred is sufficient.
The president of the Australian
Institute of Agricultural Science, Mr.
B. Owen French, has lately spelled
out the changing demands, too. “New
approaches to extension will be neces-
sary for the future progress of agri-
culture in Australia,” he has said,
adding that, to date, the extension
services generally had not adopted pro-
grams designed to bring about broad
changes in a region or industry. The
stress must now be on higher rates of
adoption of improved agricultural
techniques and on farm management.
Wishes, however, are not enough, for
the implementation of Mr. French’s
desires seems likely to require far more
extension officers and consultants than
now appear readily available. Provision
of taxation concessions and special
financial assistance for farmers to
effect improvements is scarcely suf-
ficient if wider extension usage is to
break down on a lack of trained staff.
That looks like happening. Mr. French
mentions the current annual demand
for agricultural graduates as 351 and
for agricultural diplomats 530. The
existing annual output is about 170
graduates and 290 diplomats!
It is pleasant to hear that Brisbane
and Melbourne Universities have estab-
lished post-graduate courses in exten-
sion. Mr. French suggests the value of
including “appropriate studies” in
diploma courses at agricultural colleges
and for bachelor degrees at universities.
With the ruling incentives, though, that
won’t do much to cater for the rising
demand. And the problem of injecting-
the needful economic and business
knowledge remains.
Mr. French optimistically anticipates
an expansion in the size of private
practitioners (where are they to come
from?) and of farm management clubs.
It is sobering to realise that “detailed
farm management advice on a con-
tinuing basis requires about one con-
sultant to no more than 30 or 40
farmers.” Farmers certainly have to
increase production faster than the in-
crease in total costs, whatever the value
of their land. They’ll need a lot more
management advice.

Safer substitutes for herbicides
FRESH CRIES OF herbicide pollution
of the depleted waters of the Murray
in the Mildura reaches and of other
streams and storages have been raised
lately. Whether there is any truth in
these renewed charges has not yet been
determined. Under the prevailing cir-
cumstances the only plausible source of
pollution would be the herbicides used
to control aquatic weeds. The total
quantity of herbicides being used for
other purposes by farmers and other
individuals in Australia is too small to
affect the purity of the water in major
streams and storages. Most of the
aquatic weed control is carried out by
State Departments which exercise due
care. Moreover, their activities are
usually subjected to scrutiny by some
independent body such as the Pesticide
Review Committee in Victoria. The
likelihood of pollution building up to
the point where people, stock, crops, or
wildlife would be endangared is, there-
fore, very remote. Nevertheless, the fact
remains that these departments are
almost entirely dependent upon chemi-
cals to keep channels and drains clear,
On his return from a recent study
tour in America, Mr. S. M. Bill, Senior
Weeds Research Officer with the Vic-
torian State Rivers and Water Supply
Commission, recommended that greater
attention be given to the question of
herbicide residues in water, soil, plants,
fish, fishfood organisms, and animals. As
long as public authorities are the main
users of herbicides the risk of undesir-
able contamination will remain low, but
as more and more individuals and
private firms start applying these chemi-
cals harmful local pollution, and per-
haps even regional pollution, will be-
come distinctly possible. He would also
like to see the departments explore
biological methods of controlling water

haven’t calculated on

weeds. He feels that there is a reason-
able chance of finding an insect to
check the growth of water couchgrass
and that some species of snails and fish
might effectively clean up the sub-
merged weeds which are often the
greatest nuisance.
At Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he
found Bob Blackburn, of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, experiment-
ing with two water snails introduced
from the rivers and streams of South
America, and was very impressed by
their potential. Marisa cornuarietis
from the Magdalena and Orinoco
watersheds of Columbia and Vene-
zuela, respectively, is a most vigorous
and voracious creature. Where condi-
tions are suitable and food abundant,
this species has been known to increase
its numbers seven-fold in ten weeks. In
weed-free waters, a nucleus breeding
population can survive on the algae,
ready to multiply quickly should weeds
reappear. Birds, rats, and certain fish
prey on it, but cannot suppress it.
Because of its preference for warm
water, Mr. Bill doubts whether Marisa
would thrive in the Victorian climate,
but allows that it should be happy in
the northern half of Australia.
Flowever, the other snail, Pomacea
australis, comes from cooler waters in
Brazil. Blackburn believes that this
species is actually the better bet, but
he has only started studying it. Pre-
liminary trials show that its appetite
is at ieast as lusty as its cousin’s,
although its reproductive capacity may
not be as great.
Fish that might give a good account
of themselves are the Chinese grass
carp and two species of the Silver Dollar
Fish of South America. Several countries
in Europe and Asia, besides Russia and
the U.S.A., have introduced the carp.
This fish eats its own weight of aquatic
weeds daily and tolerates cold or warm
water. The Japanese say it doesn’t
interfere with other fish, and the
Russians think it has intrinsic value
as a source of protein-rich food for
humans. They also claim to have over-
come the early difficulty of getting the
carp to breed outside their native en-
vironment. The South American fish
need warm water and would be limited
to northern Australia.
Other non-chemical ways of con-
trolling aquatic weeds include burning
with flame-throwers, shading with black
polythene sheet, and fertilisation. Both
burning and shading are expensive, and
for various other reasons are unlikely to
becdme acceptable methods. Fertilising
with a mixture of nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium holds some promise,
especially for farm dams and lakes.
Mr. Bill says that this technique works
by promoting such a rich growth of
unicellular algae that the light cannot
penetrate down to the weeds. Fish do
well under these conditions. The method,
unfortunately, can backfire. In some
situations fertilising helps the weeds.
Research is needed to define the
potential of this method in Australia.

Twelve thousand memories
by SANDRA HALL
AMID THE current burst of film
fervor in Sydney, one local project
should earn its authors some kind of
prize for dedication to cinema. It is
the Australian Film Guide’s index to
“Twelve Thousand Motion Pictures”
(the first instalment is now on the
bookstalls), and it has occupied its
editor, John Howard Reid, for the past
12 years.
At 18, Mr. Reid, one of Sydney’s
(the world’s?) most indomitable cine-
astes, set himself the herculean task
of detailing every sound film ever made
in the English language, along with
selected foreign films. At 30, he has
just published the first of the As, with
the rest of the alphabetical list promised
for successive issues of the Guide. Mr.
Reid estimates he will be reaching Z in
18 years’ time, two years away from his
50th birthday.
He then plans to go back to the
beginning, interpolating productions
released in the meantime. That should
take him a relatively brief five years,
he thinks.
Films, predictably, are his passion,
but his company, International Cinema-
tographers’ Association, does admit a
certain diversification in its activities.
He distributes some 30 or 40 news-
paper and magazine titles, among them
the St. Louis “Post Despatch,” the
Philadelphia “Enquirer,” and a number
of film periodicals. And, unpredictably,
he publishes a frequently changing
string of “girlie” magazines. All these,
he says, enable him to carry on with
his film interests, which, unfortunately,
do not make money.
He started the Australian Film Guide,
which operates at a slight loss, one and
a half years ago. He prints 10,000
copies, of which 6000 to 9500 are sold
in all States but South Australia. “I
can’t understand it. We even sell a
few copies in the Northern Territory,
but although we’ve tried very hard we
haven’t been able to sell one copy in'
South Australia, which is supposed to
be a fairly cultural community with
the Festival and everything else. But,
no.”
Reid’s company has the top floor of
a Pitt Street office building with a
temperamental lift. He works in com-
fortable chaos in one office, while the
outer rooms are occupied by a recep-
tionist, a bookkeeper, magazine stocks,
10,000 reference books on films, and two
lovebirds.
Reid is a graduate in Arts at Sydney
University, and three university friends
Barrie Pattison, Harvey Dearing,
and Robert Gowland have helped
him to compile the index. “Mr. Patti-
son,” he said with an old-fashioned
formality which suits his vaguely eru-
dite air, “spent seven years in England,
so has seen some foreign films we
haven’t seen here. Mr. Dearing has two
or three dozen favorite stars, about
whose work he knows everything. For
instance, he can tell you about every
film Errol Flynn, Marlene Dietrich or
Alice Faye have ever appeared in.
And Mr. Gowland w r orks for APS
and sees every film which ever comes
in.”
Of course, Mr. Reid is no slouch
himself, having discovered several
years ago that he has the startling
faculty of being able to remember
frame by frame, word for word, every
film he has ever seen beginning
with Laurel and Hardy in “Jitterbug,”
when he was five. And since he has
seen 10,000 films since the age of
13, this a a feat worth remarking. “I
sometimes sit down and run my fav-
orite films through my mind,” he said,
looking as if he might turn on this
mental projector at any moment.
He decided to produce the index
because he was concerned at the lack
of a comprehensive record of films and
because he thought it would be “dis-
astrous if they vanished into unde-
served oblivion.”
“Film has been the neglected art.
So many of the silent films have just
disappeared altogether. Companies
went bankrupt, and in the ’thirties there
were a series of fires in film vaults. You
know, Tom Mix made hundreds of
films and only two survive one the
- worst film he ever made. Newspapers
haven’t always reviewed films, and
even the studios don’t keep all the
publicity material.”
So, ,12 years ago, Reid began writ-
ing to the film exchanges for infor-
mation, and distributors helped by pro-
viding him with free passes into their
cinemas.
“When none of us have been able
to see a film, I’ve made a compendium
of the opinions of other critics
taking a sort of middle Approach. Not
a terrible satisfactory way of doing it,
but there was nothing else we could
do.”
A flip through the As is a nostalgic
experience, indeed recalling the
fact that Abbott and Costello once met
Captain Kidd, that Kay Kendal!
appeared in a film called “Abdulla the
Great,” that Walter Fluston played
Abraham Lincoln in 1930.
As well as listing date, cast, director,
and production details, Reid has
awarded each film a percentage accord-
ing to its entertainment value, although
he feels his scoring is more liberal than
other critics’ would be.
He is a staunch defender of Ameri-
can films against the fashionable criti-
cisms of Continentally oriented film
buffs. “We see only the cream of the
Continental films here, while we see
almost everything America ever makes,
so naturally we see more bad American
pictures than good. Anyway, even the
dreariest Hollywood hack directors
have their good moments and the best
directors do disappointing work. Orson
John Howard Reid, film fan
Welles has always been number one
with me still is. ‘Citizen Kane’ was
magnificent, but some of his work on
Shakespeare has been unexciting.
Clouzot, the French director who did
‘The Fiends,’ is great, but he’s done
some routine stuff, too.”
With a nice sense of expediency, Mr.
Reid is printing a couple of thousand
more copies of the Australian Guide
now the index is underway, so that he
can eventually tear instalments of the
index out of the left-over copies and
bind them into six volumes containing
2000 films each. The first of these
should be on sale in two years’ time.
But why 12,000 films? “Well, it is a
fairly arbitrary number, chosen because
we thought it was a reasonable guess.
All it really means is that we w r on’t
do any less than 12,000, although we
may certainly do more. In fact, we
probably will.”


Adelaide Festival
After futility,
on to 1970
by ROBERT WARD
THE FIFTH Adelaide Festival ended
with the usual self-congratulatory
statements and the standard calls for
better venues. In theatre, for this
reviewer, the fortnight guttered to a
close with several reasonable minor
presentations and a growing sense of
the futility of official cultural things.
On the Festival fringe there was
Sheridan Theatre’s production of Bar-
bara Carson’s “Macbird,” smoothly
directed by Jean Marshall, and with
good take-offs of Kennedy the First by
John Potter and Johnson by Doug
Dolphin. Perhaps after the assassina-
tion in the hysterical heat of the
moment this play may have said some-
thing to Americans with a conspiracy
complex, but I doubt if it would be
possible to write a more pointless
and inconsistent political parody. The
most disappointing thing about this
production was the feeling that the
unusually sensible Sheridan Theatre
actually felt it was presenting some-
thing shockingly true and important.
On to “Good Grief,” a revue at the
Sheridan after “Macbird.” Conceding
that this was better than the average
Adelaide revue, which is usually too
camp or too undergraduate to bother
with, and acknowledging the relative
maturity of material and adequacy in
performance, one couldn’t help feeling
that the program should have been
cut considerably. Teddy Hodgeman
the enlivening element, as he was
in the “Inspector General,” and there
was a superb opening sequence wdren,
as the “Spirit of the Festival” and
embodiment of Shakespeare, all S’s in
his script were pronounced as F. Not
only was it a very clever script by
Judy Lott, but I doubt if anyone else
could have surmounted the problems
of articulation as brilliantly as Hodge-
man did.
The Players is a most irritating com-
pany, since they will continually style
themselves as “professional.” This
wouldn’t be criticism at all if they pro-
duced plays to which that epithet could
be attached. Their Festival productions
took place in the new AMP Theatre,
and w'ere Strindberg’s “The Stronger”
and David Mercer’s “Let’s Murder
Vivaldi,” which w'as their main play of
the night. It is an amusing tale about
a stenographer and her neurotic lover,
whom she leaves, the stenographer and
her civil-servant boss, who cannot excite
her or himself, the boss and his wife,
whom he murders, and the eventual
reconciliation of the stenographer and
the lover.
It is an English version of the fash-
ionable, modern, small American com-
edies of manners (as with Carlino and
Manhoff), but to my mind the dialogue
is better, more subtle, the characters
richer, the themes broader. All the
characters analyse each other and them-
selves in Freudian terms, and this pro-
cess is the pivot on which the wit
swings.
I found Herbert Davies’ production of
the play uncertain. He could not seem
to decide whether to produce it in terms
of broad caricatures, as 1 think it should
have been, or straight, deadpan, and as
a serious but comic comment on our
times, which is absurd.
Thus Barbara West's stenographer is
played straight, when, in fact, the char-
acter would be effectively humorous as
a cheap, awkward piece of Cockney
giggle. Len Sweeney’s civil servant is
dull and ordinary, with only an attempt
at a thin-lipped bureaucratic manner,
when, in fact, he should have been
richly, broadly drawn. The
set of Geoff Barnes was
lacking in both imagina-
tion and style, and the pro-
duction as a whole .was of
a fair amateur standard.
One - man lunch - hour
shows were given by Peter
O’Shaughnessy and Rob
Inglis. Peter O’Shaugh-
nessy’s “While the Billy
Boils” was a selection of
verse and prose by Henry
Lawson, delivered in a re-
laxed and balanced man-
ner. It was a straight-
forward and effective per-
formance. Rob Inglis set
himself the harder task,
with “Men Who Shaped
Australia.” These ranged
from Wakefield in prison,
through Wentworth and
Carboni Raffaello, to Parkes and Arch-
bishop Vaughan. By taking legitimate
historical liberties, Mr. Inglis gave to
each character a distinctive voice and
style. Each character was introduced
by yet a further character, a Cockney
spruiker, who also provided historical
background. In all this, Mr. Inglis dis-
played range, taste, and great technical
virtuosity.
Theatre 62’s second play for the Fes-
tival was Bill Macllwrath’s . “The
Anniversary,” whose central character
is a vicious, dominating nouveau riche
mother who runs a jerry-built housing
business. We are shown the moments
leading up to her sons’ rebellion against
her. Veteran Adelaide actress, Margery
Irving, gave a brassy, biting perfor-
mance as the mother, and overall it
was a good production by John Ed-
mund, very crude and bitchily funny,
and with clever playing by the whole
cast. Jonathan Leigh’s Terry was pro-
letarian and morose, Robert Antilles
Tom was a brash spiv, and John
Gaden’s Henry was softly mother-
fixated. With brilliant revue by Maggie
Soboil and Frank Lazarus, an intellec-
tually stimulating “Poor Bitos,” and a
very funny “The Anniversary,” Theatre
62’s unsubsidised and unofficial con-
tribution to the Festival proved to be,
theatrically, the most worthwhile.
What of the next Festival? As a
comparison with Adelaide’s it was in-
teresting to read in “Time” and in
a private letter of the recent Festival
at Buffalo, New York State. This had
premieres of two Albee plays, a new
work by lannis Xenakis, a new opera
by Henri Pousseur, and coup of coups,
lectures by the Greek city planner and
idealist, Constantinos Doxiades, along
with quite spectacular art exhibitions
and a variety of first-class ■ subsidiary
items. New York critics felt that, not-
withstanding, it was a dull Festival
at Buffalo. One wonders what they
would have said had they shuffled
off to Adelaide.
The Adelaide Festival authorities
have appointed Sir Robert Helpmann
as the artistic director of the next Fes-
tival, and he has already begun to
Sir Robert Helpmann and friend during the Aus-
tralian Ballet’s Asian tour... a showy “show” for
1970?
negotiate for artists and companies. Be-
cause of its new. director, the 1970
Festival is an unknown quantity, though
some people are predicting, on the
basis of Sir Robert’s statements, a
showy and more popularly based round
of entertainment. If this is so, then
the Adelaide Festival may lose much
of its social starch along with its
little ai't. At this Festival, the popularly
based items were not by any means
the most popular events.
One post-Festival scandal which
particularly annoys some of the guaran-
tors, who are private citizens and com-
panies, is the disclosure that tickets
sales for Marlene Dietrich were down
and that a large number of seats to
her show had to be literally given away.
The guarantors are naturally upset,
since it will be they who will pay in
the long run.
But "finally, in Adelaide there is a
nicely satisfied feeling that the city
has just enjoyed a unique cultural event,
something of which Australia may be
proud. Perhaps it is proud, but if so,
then it is a measure of cultural in-
adequacy.


ENTERTAINMENT
Music
The value in
communication
By KAY LUCAS
Symphony No. 1. George Dreyfus.
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
IF EVER A creative fellowship has
paid off, then the Australian National
University has been well rewarded for
its choice of George Dreyfus as the
first composer to be awarded this fel-
lowship. The symphony that received
its world premiere when it opened the
ABC concert season in Melbourne was
the outcome of this fellowship, and the
Commission, too, is to be complimented
on its initiative in placing a new Aus-
tralian symphony in such a vantage
point.
Any new work is bound to create
strong feelings; it would seem that
the strongest aroused by this sym-
phony have been those of delight at
the memories of other works and
other composers that it has evoked.
But too much can be made of this, for,
as far as I know, nobody holds it
against Beethoven that he sometimes
sounds like Mozart. The positive merit
of the work lies in the fact that the
composer has had sufficient backbone
to be able to withstand the insidious
pressures that are brought to bear on
him by a cultured pseudo-elite and
a rabidly partisan Press. It is all too
easy to create novel sounds with novel
instruments. The difficulty lies in
using old instruments to create new
sounds and communicable images.
The symphony is in three move-
ments. Of outstanding interest in the
first movement is the way Dreyfus
uses the simplest metres to create a
complexity and rhythmic vitality
which carries right through the
whole work. From a somewhat arid
opening, which appears to wear its
seriousness like a heavy cloak, the
movement concludes with a melodic
and harmonic cliche that cannot hide
its humorous intent. This impression
is further reinforced by the final chord
of the movement, which, in the grand
tradition, tells the audience that now
all is over.
The second movement reinforces the
impression that the 19th-century sym-
phonic medium can still afford a valid
comment today. Although the echoes of
Mahler seem unmistakable, it is not
Mahler we are hearing but the
authentic assimilation into a composer’s
stylistic idiom of those traditional
elements which have always constituted
the life-blood of art.
Since Beethoven, the conclusion of a
work has always posed a greater prob-
lem than its beginning; in the Dreyfus
symphony, the conclusion outweighs
the opening beyond measure. The final
movement, from its quiet viola opening,
builds through a dynamic and rhythmic
crescendo enclosing some of the most
interesting and novel orchestral writing
of the whole work. When, at the end,
the noise and shouting have died,
leaving the solo viola supported by the
other violas playing harmonics, the
crown is placed on the whole work, and
one can only regret that Mr. Dreyfus
felt obliged to cancel this impression
with a noisy ending. Without this end-
ing, the communication of a complex
personality perhaps would have been
seen as a more logical whole.
Mr. Dreyfus has not cheapened art
or the artist by placing himself in the
historically valid position of a composer
influenced by other composers. If one
can conclude anything at this stage
about this symphony’s ultimate value,
that conclusion might perhaps be based
most hopefully upon the fact that the
work directs the attention of the listener
to the artistic communication and away
from the technical paraphernalia. There
are not many works of which one can
say so much.
Atzmon proves
his worth
by PAUL FROLICH
WHEN THE ABC announced the
non-renewal of Dean Dixon’s contract
there were murmurs of consternation
and fears that the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra would never have the benefit
of a genuinely permanent conductor.
It is now clear that these fears were
groundless. Moshe Atzmon, currently
spending a relatively brief period with
the orchestra as guest conductor, has
signed a three-year contract under
which he will live with his orchestra
for the greater part of the concert
seasons. Our other need was of a con-
ductor with imagination, drive, and high
standards. In the first subscription con-
cert of 1968, Mr. Atzmon proved that
he has these qualities.
Moshe Atzmon, at 36, has already
established a considerable reputation
with many overseas orchestras. His
direction is artistic yet firm and I
was amazed by the degree of co-oper-
ation he receives and, to my ear, the
SSO has not sounded as good and en-
thusiastic for a decade. The program of
this first concert was a sound enough
trial: Mozart, Bartok, Tchaikovsky.
Mozart’s Symphony No. 29, the finest
of the earlier symphonies, is a testing
piece to start with. It is scored for
strings and a wind quartet and demands
both accurate attack and finess in the
playing. The performance was a
stylishly graceful one, a hint of joys
in store for us. The Hungarian pianist
Annie Fischer was soloist in Bartok’s
3rd concerto, last heard here in 1965
during Vasary’s tour. The concerto,
one of Bartok’s most accessible scores,
is both difficult and beautiful; Miss
Fischer’s sure interpretation of it was
almost perfect in its clarity, incisiveness,
and subtle phrasing.
There are still traces of raggedness
in the brass section, there is not yet that
final polish that I believe Mr. Atzmon
will eventually impose on our orchestra,
but his control of the players through-
out, his lively tempi and overall con-
ception of the music were pretty well
matched by the precision of the play-
ing and by the musicians’ response to
all the dynamic demands made of
them.
Films
Multi-level
enjoyment
by BEVERLEY TIVEY
In the Heat of the Night. Director,
Norman Jewison.
THIS IS A film to be enjoyed on more
than one level. To begin with, it’s
a good, sound crime thriller. Beyond
that, it’s an intelligent and searching
character study. Above all, it’s a
clear-eyed study of prejudice which sees
the fault on both sides and offers no
simple solution of this problem—merely
an almost off-hand suggestion that if
we all got to know each other better
we might find we weren’t all so hard
to get on with.
It begins with the discovery of a
murder in a hot, sleepy town in Missi-
ssippi. The police promptly arrest a
Negro stx'anger —to them his color and
his unfamiliarity make him the obvious
suspect —only to find to their embar-
rassment that he’s a highly regarded
police officer. The police chief at first
mistrusts and resents him, emotions
which the Negro heartily reciprocates.
But by the end they’ve not only solved
the murder, they have built up the
grudging beginnings of mutual respect
and understanding.
The relationship between the two
men is beautifully handled by both
director and actors. Rod Steiger, seedy
and paunchy, makes a striking visual
contrast to the sleek, almost dapper
Sidney Poitier, and both give splendid
performances, with Steiger perhaps just
a little ahead on points. And the
script allows both of them to be men,
not mouthpieces it’s particularly
pleasing to see Poitier allowed to play
a human being, prickly, edgy, occasion-
ally spiteful, after all the personifica-
tions of Noble Longsuffering that he’s
been lumbered with lately.
Norman Jewison’s direction is
notable for its sense of place and its
feeling for timing, with the leisurely life
of the town erupting every now and
again into violence. Altogether, this is a
high-class film, both technically and
intellectually.

Art
The artist
comes first
By ELWYN LYNN
lan Fairweather. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
TIME WAS when lan Fairweather,
semi-hermit of Bribie Island and rafts-
man of the Timor Sea, provoked amused
admiration as the epitome of the artist
and as the Chinese. scholar and ecole
de Paris recluse who inverted the myth-
ology of outbackery. Instead of city
men painting bush and desert for urban
consumption, here was an avant-garde
calligrapher ensconsed in the forest, de-
veloping a style with the dedication of
Cezanne, inducing the aficionados to
post their agents early for the annual
relevation and arousing the idolatrous
worship of the young.
He was a manifestation of the legend
of the artist whose work recorded a
subtle and sensitive unfolding of the
inner life. I am using the past tense not
because Fairweather’s spell is fading out,
but because we now confront new kinds
of artists who are suspicious of intuition
and whose procedure is analagous to
the scientist’s. Rejecting the notion of
painting as the symbolic expression of
emotion, artists are opting out of the
picture.
Theirs is the very antithesis of Fair-
weather’s attitude, but I don’t want to
cast him in the role of reminder that
there are other ways to create paintings
besides Artists Anonymous: with an
entrancing show he comes as an op-
portune reminder of the primacy of the
artist in a situation where a verbal feud
between critic and dealers is taking
precedence over the importance of the
artist as creator and where some critics
are loath to attempt an evaluative de-
scription of a work-of-art.
Fairweather is simply one of those
intriguing, creative personalities whose
work reflects his triumphs, tribulations,
and ceaseless quest; this, his first show
since his 1966 retrospective, has a few
earlier works dating back to 1959, such
as War and Peace, with its slow fusing
of broad ribbons of dimmed fawn and
pink, and House by the Sea, a later,
large, and splendid painting that rivals
Monastery of 1961 and Monsoons of
1962, but has a more ddring spatial dis-
persion as dusty-pink and black calli-
graphy activates, whips into movement
or solidifies areas of seemingly inert back-
ground which suddenly breaks into
faded gold and pours a cascade of
drips along its bottom border. It in-
volves a more autonomously wayward
and flexible script than in the 1967
works, which include but one truly calli-
graphic essay, Composition, where a
hesitant line wanders over a brown
palimpsest. Was there ever such a lonely,
lost, introspective line.
Fairweather is now less involved with
Cubist space and the modified ideo-
gram; the tightly knit paintings are
almost smothered in blobs and dashing
inflections. The black outlines, both im-
posed and hidden, are enclosed in blots
of sombre or pastel hues like a blow-
up of an unusually gloomy Vuillard,
but Fairweather has little of Vuillard’s
graceful deployment of stains, blots,
and strokes, for he seems intent on
so acculating these inflections that
he smothers, confines, and suppresses
the space that once he liberated so
variously. This is emphasised by the
cream-grey border he leaves on the
left of the closely packed, brown pro-
cession that is Children and Donkey.
Space is no longer allowed to expand
as it does in Pool where the tight central
calligraphy binding the six figures
loosens to meet the three empty bord-
ers in this masterfhlly free and deliber-
ated work.
His curbing of calligraphy and sub-
jugation of space is more evident in
two works on heads where calligraphy
is relegated to simple outline and a
compact cluster of notations, restless
and busily engaged in destroying the
use of space as pause and rest. The
containment is further stressed by bands
of grey that horizontally wall in the
heads; such bands, which once signified
the expansive freedom at the painting’s
edge, have moved in as barricades.
There are still signs of a Futurist,
overlapping procession of forms, but
Fairweather is now concerned more
with the isolated image indicated by
masses of broken touches sometimes
suggesting the desperate fervor of ex-
pressionism. A new surface dynamism
is most evident in Standing Figures l r
where figures of brown, blotted oblongs
are surrounded by larger, looser dark
brown oblongs as though his former
linear wilfulness was now inhabiting
these robust, restless patches.
The beautiful wan and sombre hues
help give these newer works a remark-
able cohesion, but it arises, too, from
a subconscious structuring, because these
works are about a surface disperal
obscurely related to hidden images of
resignation, renunciation, and the fleet-
ing evidence that all is not meaningless
chaos. It’s an imagery that requires a
Fairweather’s masterly understatement.
A grave omission: I must record my
admiration for Graubner’s pink-edged
mass, like a captured white cloud, under
nylon in the Adelaide show of German
contemporaries; the most uncannily
amusing thing I’ve seen.
The artist "at home"
lAN FAIRWEATHER used to send
paintings from his Bribie Island
hermitage to Sydney in rather primi-
tive packing, sometimes nailing them
to boards with more regard for their
safe delivery than their value. Nowa-
days, Fairweather’s works arrive at
Sydney’s Macquarie Galleries with
the careful assistance of sophisticated
packers and carriers one of the
few simple benefits of civilisation
which the painter cares to utilise.
Fairweather, 77 next September, is
back at his bush retreat on Bribie
after a visit to see relatives in Eng-
land last year. The Queensland Gov-
ernment has now granted him the
land on which his rough work- and
living-huts are clustered, and while
he was away the authorities also de-
livered an outdoor lavatory a dis-
tinctive piece of Queensland archi-
tecture and an object he shows with
some amusement to rare visitors.
The mere mention of money is still
anathema to him. Proceeds from the
sale of his new works have to be
dribbled to him subtly and at inter-
vals; he has to be urged to accept any
increase in the amounts. Of his 19
new works now on show, many do not
carry his conventional signature.
Instead, they are rubber-stamped
(mauve ink on white paper) with a
translation of his name in Chinese
characters. This is the most recent
evidence of his long fascination with
Chinese calligraphy and the outcome
of a correspondence with a Chinese
scholar who so admired Fairweather’s
English translation of “The Drunken
Buddha,” a 13th-century devotional
tale, that he translated his name into
hieroglyphics as a thanks offering.


BOOKS
The fair-go theory in practice
By HENRY MAYER
The Press Council. H. Phillip Levy.
Macmillan. $18.40.
DEBATE on the standards the British
Press ought to follow takes place in a
very peculiar world. It is not like the
worlds of Billy Bunter, Kafka, or the
Cheshire cat, yet evokes memories of
them all.
The newspapers are thought of as
falling into three groups two small
ones which have secured certificates of
exemption, and one large one which is
treated as if it were a candidate re-
quired to pass a course in Press
standards.
At the top, the ten percent or so of
elite papers are treated as natural
aristocrats, hence as not needing
scrutiny: If they decay so that they
lose money and are taken over by an
upstart, they may get hauled before the
board of newspaper examiners. But talk
of costs and profits strikes many as
inappropriate and vulgar when applied
to the top quality Press. Takeover bids
are shocking. When Thomson grabbed
“The Times,” a large part of the Estab-
lishment reacted as if Onassis had man-
aged to buy the Royal Navy.
At the bottom there are papers which
do not even pretend to do more than
peddle scandal and sex. If one wished,
one could start distinguishing between
them in terms of criteria of relative
honesty. Some promise more and deliver
less than others. But the critics who
believe the Press must bear their stamp
of moral approval do not feel that
“trash” can even be an object of moral
discrimination. To treat it as such
would somehow lower the tone of the
examination meeting. Yet disapproval
must be expressed. So the real rags
are treated rather like the Catholic
Church used to deal with heretics. They
are handed over to those, like Arthur
Rylah in Victoria, fit to do the dirty
work of turning moral disapproval into
legal sanctions.
These two moves made, there remains
the largest group that of the ordinary
popular papers. Precisely what the
course is in which they are to be ex-
amined is never made very clear. It
has something to do with “standards.”
Only cads dare ask down-to-earth ques-
tions about these. For the examiners,
there are no doubts that there are
standards, that they are simple and self-
evident, that they do not change over
time, and that they are sufficiently
coherent and specific so that an editor
of goodwill can apply them easily to
given specific cases.
These assumptions are touching in an
age of relativism and one which at least
pays lip service to the dangers of
ideology. It is in the discussion about
the Press that one of the last areas for
simple-minded religious beliefs disguised
as self-evident moral imperatives exists.
That the assumptions are of a quasi-
religious nature comes out most clearly
when we ask how the standards are
related to the balance sheets. There is
a tacit understanding that if proprietors
follow them they will act as a guarantee
against the collapse of a paper on com-
mercial grounds.
The morally approved is transmuted
into the commercially viable. Viable
but no more. If the papers and their
owners wax fat, this in itself is seen as
a danger sign, an index of moral de-
generation. The board of newspaper
examiners, however, is convinced that
what it thinks of as a respectable paper
is assured frugal survival by the very
fact that it is respectable.
These days, those who have consti-
tuted themselves as examiners of the
Press are men of great self-assurance.
They never doubt their mission, neither
as to effect nor as to inherent impor-
tance. They cannot tell what the effects
of their stamp of moral approval are,
nor what happens to Press candidates
who are flunked. They assume that
something must happen to them, and
go on moralising. And they do so within
the framework of capitalist society
they believe in the private ownership
of the Press.
The conduct of the candidates, in the
first place of Press proprietors, and then
of editors and journalists, is less self-
assured, more ambivalent. Often, when
they get tired of the whole enterprise,
they talk as if they were going to boy-
cott the board and stick solely to the
quite different criteria of profits and
circulation figures. Yet, though they
deny the board standing in particular
cases, they rarely openly challenge its
legitimacy as such. However much they
may pride themselves on being no-
nonsense businessmen, it seems clear
that the board irritates them, yet they
feel they ought to account to it.
The whole strange operation for most
of the time takes place in an isolated
world full of shadows. Outside, the
millions of readers hurry and scurry.
Most of them were hooked on a given
paper when young. They never ask
themselves why they prefer the “Daily
Blurb” to the “Daily Bugle.” Where
they are told that this is the vital
question and that it must be answered
in terms of “responsibility” or similar
concepts, they are puzzled. If they are
not overwhelmed by the high earnest-
ness of the questioner, they may even
reply in quite other and most prosaic
terms. A broadsheet is better for wrap-
ping the rubbish in, but much harder to
read in the train.
Most people read newspapers, very
few read about them. For the masses,
though their paper sketches a Dicture of
the world outside day by day, that
Levy ... not the man to ask
world remains remote. The people w!h>
run the Press are total strangers and
the paper has little relation to the
urgencies of daily living. Yet from time
to time the average reader scans some-
thing he knows about or feels strongly
about. It is then that some may feel
that the paper has misreported some-
thing, or is biased, or has made a factual
slip. It is then that some demand a
right to be heard, and a very small
proportion fight for such a right..

and act as a readers’ ombudsman has
for decades been advocated by the ALP
and the Australian Journalists’ Associa-
tion. Most proprietors have been hostile
to the idea. This book should, but won’t,
lead to a reversal.
A British Royal Commission sug-
gested such a Council in 1949. The
papers, fearing that a voluntary body
with moral suasion as sole sanction
would end in Government control,
opposed the idea. By 1953, with the
threat of a Press law and a Press levy
hanging over them, they agreed to a
very weak Council with a miniscule
budget and run entirely by themselves.
By 1961, more papers had folded and
a second Royal Commission had scolded
the proprietors and the Council. After
new and firm hints of legislation, a
reformed Council started in 1964.
It consists of 20 members, only five
of them lay. These are elected by eight
bodies, of which five represent the
owners, one the editors, and two the
journalists’ unions. The 15 Press people
co-opt the five laymen and pick the
chairman Lord Devlin. The budget,
only $12,000 before reform, now runs to
around $40,000 a year. If you think
Press standards have been breached,
you must first write to the editor. If
he does not act, you may then complain
to the Council unless you are also trying
to sue the paper. The Council looks at
the complaint, may examine witnesses,
and then upholds or rejects it. The
papers affected have a moral duty to
print the findings, and nearly all do
so, though Mr. Levy is not the man to
ask where, how soon after the com-
plaint, nor who notices them.
This very irritating but extremely
useful work by an Australian who is
head of the Legal Department of the
London Daily Mirror Group is a quasi-
official report of the case law of this
strange court of honor. It combines
a sober sketch of the Council with a
long summary and classification of all
complaints before it and its findings.
The author is not interested in much
beside the cases. You have to work out
such basic data as the number of cases
heard for yourself. It seems that in the
first decade, 1953-63, the Council did
very little, hearing only around 300
complaints. When lay representation
was added and the budget increased,
it perked up and heard around 700 cases
in 1964-66. If we assume around 350
complaints as an average and remem-
ber the vast number of readers in Eng-
land, the marginal importance of the
Council comes out clearly enough.
However, since it acts as a Court of
Appeal, what one would like to know is
whether the cases which editors can
and do fix themselves have gone up or
not. If they have, one may say that the
existence of a right of appeal is of
value. But although the Council has a
research department, we are not given
a single figure on this.
Nor are there any statistics as to the
type of complaints or what kinds of
papers bear the brunt. All we are told
is that 20 percent of the complaints are
dismissed as frivolous prior to investiga-
tion. Of the rest, about half are dis-
missed and half upheld. This can be
made to mean that the whole of the
British Press “sins” only 175 times per
year, but, of course, there’s all the world
of difference between “sins” and “in-
vestigated sins.” The number of com-
plaints and sins varies strikingly from
topic to topic, though again you must
work this out for yourself. Thus in
the 1953-67 period there were 37 com-
plaints about unfair comment, 30 of
which were rejected, but 95 complaints
about misreporting and misrepresenta-
tion, of which 57 were rejected. It is
on “corrections and apologies” that
nearly all the complaints made were up-
held 35 out of 40. The number is
tiny. There are hardly any complaints
about three areas usually singled out
as major sins of the Australian Press:
four on crime reports (two guilty), four
on treatment of sex (one guilty), and
only 14 on “reporting politics and
political parties,” of which four were
upheld.
The author thinks the Council has
been a success. His chief evidence is
that early fears that the Council
would be swamped, would be crippled
by libel actions, that the papers would
not print the findings, that the lay bloc
\yould vote against the professional bloc
have all proved groundless and that,
above all, the British Press now fully
supports .the Council.
This is hardly surprising. Newspaper
owners, like all of us, often make gross
mistakes about what would, in fact,
serve their interests, but they do not
usually stick to them for ever. For a
voluntary levy of $40,000 they have
bought a mantle of moral respectability
which protects them against legislation.
Levy argues that the fact that the
British Press supports the Council is
good evidence of its success. I should
have thought it was first-rate evidence
that it does not have much bite and
bites but rarely.
The Press Council was supposed to
take care of the readers who were upset
and could not get a fair go from the
editors. The most remarkable thing
about Levy’s book is that the readers
who complained get only an indirect
mention through their complaints being
summarised there is not even a hint
about how they are and how they feel
about success.
Australian owners still suffer from
the bogies about Press Councils which
the British have dropped, They should
think again. As to those few readers
who take a genuine interest in news-
papers, they will, after reading Levy,
oppose Press Councils as a glaring
instance of the misallocation of scarce
resources. For $40,000 a year you could
start a modest weekly or monthly news-
letter on the Australian Press which did
not worry too much about moralising
but gave an informed analytical critique
instead.

Angry rooster
By NANCY KEESING
The Chantic Bird. David Ireland.
Heinemann. $3.50.
IN HIS FIRST novel David Iceland
displays a considerable talent which’ may
prove to be a major Australian talent
in time and, perhaps, for our times.
But I cannot like his book. Some lines
of Yeats’ in “The Second Coming” des-
cribe it uncannily;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot
hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and
everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all convicition, while the
worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
“The worst,” who, “full of passionate
intensity,” narrates this novel is a 16-
year-old criminal psychopath in whose
history agony (20th-century urban
variety) is piled on agony to such a
neo-Elizabethan extent that it is a
tribute to Ireland that his book appears
to have validity.
The boy, we must suppose, is in-
sane. However, in the terms of his
story, I do not think we are intended
to assume that all his actions are fan-
tasies. By his own account he is rapist,
murderer, arsonist, thief, wanton van-
dal, handy with gun, knife, and fists.
He believes he is followed by someone
out to get him and suffers from an ill-
ness (heart disease?) of increasing
severity. His brother died of leukaemia,
his father, a religious fanatic, of TB,
his mother of despair.
Sometimes he is little worse than a
Puck to harry society, but sometimes
he is a Demon-out-of-Hell figure in an
emblematic leather coat. Authority does
not unmask him, although it may sus-
pect, because he is intelligent, resource-
ful, and operates without companions
as he roves the suburbs of Sydney
wreaking havoc, torture, and assault
wherever he goes.
If his actions then are not all fantasy,
what of his background? There is the
house to which he constantly returns
which harbors his infant brother and
sister, (Stevo and Chris); the girl Bee
and her baby, Allie. Intermittently the
boy provides this menage with food,
money, and wary love. This establish-
ment, together with a realistically des-
cribed Hornsby District Hospital, has to
be fantasy. Neighbors, Bee’s relations,
the local school, or, failing these, the
Hospital, would have sooled the Child
Welfare Department on to this lot in
less time than it takes to tell. Yet all
is just sufficiently not fantasy to hang
together. “Things fall apart” and “the
centre cannot hold” once you put the
book aside. But while you read, (and
this, of course, is a, measure of Ire-
land's skill) there is a lopsided logic
to the story and, too, to the fantasy
Ireland. .. passionate intensity
within fantasy of Stevo’s version of the
allegory which gives the book its name.
A temporary illusion of possibility
lends semblance of conviction to what
the jacket calls “bizarre social com-
mentary.” The boy is motivated solely
by disgust and hatred and has no moral
choice in his warped mind, but some
of his targets are entirely deserving of
anyone’s anger or derision.
I have said I do not like “The
Chantic Bird.” It is not that I boggle
at its subject matter or its anarchy,
and certainly not because I have no
wish to be disturbed by what I read.
But the fashionably sadistic relish of its
writing disguises its basic evasion
it has no standpoint. In art (and there
seems no reason to except the Theatre
of the Absurd), uncontrasted evil can
be as false and mawkish as uncon-
trasted goodness. If Bee, Stevo, and
Chris are intended as contrasts, then
neither they, nor the fabled Bird, suc-
ceed in this role, for, like everything
else in the novel, they are corrupted in
the description of their corrupt nar-
rator.

Ever been
caught
by a boom?
There has never been a time in
Australia’s history when people have
been as wine conscious as they are
now. But*the great upsurge in
interest, coupled with a dry year,
have created shortages of many of
the best wines Australia produces.
One of the things about a boom,
when the goods are in short supply,
is that standards can slip.
Orlando’s standards will not slip.
For years, in anticipation, we have
been thinking ahead - planting new
areas and new varieties, developing
and exploring new techniques and
equipment - and we will continue to
do so. But even so, current demand
has outstripped us. If you find
difficulty on occasion in obtaining
your chosen Orlando table wines,
we hope you will remember that
while we would like to take
advantage of the boom, we are
utterly convinced that it is more
important to preserve the quality
that has achieved such high
recognition of our wines at home
and abroad.

those in the two works on myths. Here
the plates are excellent; those of Aus-
tralian bark paintings are greenish, but
that on Maiu, the Polynesian hero, is
remarkable in detail and tone and the
pitting in the pale fawn stone head of
Yum Caax, the maize god, is beauti-
fully realised, but the trouble is that
the myths, legends, and stories told by
Irene Nicholson, who was once “The
Times” and BBC correspondent in
Mexico City, and Roslyn Poignant,
whose qualifications are not noted, are
insufficiently related to the text.
What is to be made of a reproduction
of a Society Islands fly-whisk with two
squatting figures joined back to back
with the comment “The image probably
had religious significance?” Yet other
captions, such as that on Tangaroa, are
sensibly detailed, as this producer of
beings from his own body appears
fleetingly in a number of tales, but the
plentiful illustrations don’t so much
illuminate the text as supply a gallery
of dramatis personae, extras, and even
props.
As “The Larousse Encyclopedia of
Mythology,” one of Hamlyn’s fortunate
publications, says, “the pantheon of
Oceania comes to us as folklore in the
turmoil of life” and even in a “fixed”
mythology like that of ancient Central
Mexico there are uncertainties, but both
authors, without stressing the confusions
and difficulties, as do the Larousse
scholars, seek the more coherent,
rational, aesthetically, or didactically
complete tales, Irene Nicholson using a
rendition by the Mexican novelist,
Rosario Castellos, to tell a tale of men
made of gold and ending with a quite
European moral: “That is why our law
says that no rich man can enter heaven
if a poor man does not lead him by the
hand.”
Though there are historical and
anthropological prefaces to various
sections, neither author is much con-
cerned to relate myths to their social
backgrounds (they should read Robert
Graves’ introduction to the Larousse:
“One constant rule of mythology is
whatever happened among the gods
above reflects events on earth”), and
Nicholson’s is an especially mixed bag
containing myths to illustrate notions
of time, eternity, and nature, an excel-
lent account of the Maya and Aztec
Calendar and of the Quetzalcoatl
myth, and leisurely narratives.
For what audiences these books are
intended is beyond conjecture they
could be dipped into by children, by
those interested in comparative religions,
and the vast legions of picture-book
aesthetes who find texts tedious and
it’s probably because the authors have
no clear idea of myth; to pepper them
once again from the Larousse which
should have been their arsenal “A
myth is not just any sort of legend,
not even a legend in which superhuman
personages take part, but an explana-
tory legend meant to give the cause of
such a fact of actual experience.”
Trewin Copplestone is not concerned
with the pantheon of the modern artistic
gods but with six movements, Fauvism,
Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, De
Stijl, and Surrealism. His introduction
is excusably groping, for how can one
calculate what people know of modern
art, now in its sixth decade but vigor-
ously resisted from its birth? The rest
is concise and sensible,. though he
wobbles with definitions and he doesn’t
clearly separate Fauvism and Expres-
sionism; a lot more work needs to be
done here J. E. Mullor in his Thames,
and Hudson book on “The Fauves”
simply put the Expressionists on the
end. Another issue that must puzzle
the beginner is what happened to
Matisse after Fauvism and Braque and
Picasso after Cubism? Did they join
the Maverick Movement? Moreover,
some artists just don’t fit categories
(let’s have an old Andersonianism: a
person may be a vehicle for conflicting
movements). Can Schwitters, Miro, and
Chagall be called Surrealists? It’s in-
structive to see Duchamp on the basis
of one painting, Nude Descending a
Staircase, appear in both the Cubist
and Futurist sections. Just what would
we have said of the Futurist Manifesto’s
“We will glorify war, the only hygiene
of the world, militarism, patriotism, the
destructive gestures of anarchists, the
great concepts for which men die, con-
tempt of women?” A mad lot. Certainly
Schwitters would have been more at
home amongst the Cubist, and, despite
his vagaries, Duchamp always stressed
rationality.
Copplestone is particularly acute ia
discussing the nature of the movements
and in using the 54 reproductions as
testimony; especially interesting is his
piece on De Stijl, its hero emerging as
Van Doesburg, whose theory of Elemen-
talism and unstable, flat planes of pre-
cise geometrical shape alarmed Mon-
drian by its idiosyncrasy! Mondrian
led his right-angled planes out of the
movement. Domela, a little-known
Elementarist, announced a theory that
has become one of the many gospels of
modern art: “The composition forms a
whole and nothing can be added to or
taken away from it. Color is used for
its dynamic effect and not for its pretti-
ness.”
Indeed, theories of the relation of
color to scale, form, and grounds have-
come to dominate thinking about recent
art that has a kinship with Mondrian
and Van Doesburg, but color-theory
insufficient to distinguish, as Copple-
stone suggests, the Fauves from the-
Expressionists.
The plates are well-chosen (though
the Klee is hardly Surreal) and large
enough to make comparisons fruitful,
especially amongst three low-tone works
by Marquet, Picasso, and Beckmann,
and it’s fine to see the last, a maker of
myths or, better, allegories as obscure
as some from ancient Mexico, take his
place in the pantheon.


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
We were very gratified being the most
successful exhibitor at the 1968 Sydney
Royal Show in the Open Table Wine
Classes —winning the Special Trophy for
the exhibitor gaining the highest
aggregate points.
Many of our prize-winning wines are
or have been sold in very substantial
quantities on the open market. In the
“1967 Vintage Open White Burgundy
Class,” our current Bin 77 White Bur-
gundy won the Gold Medal, and in the
“Any Vintage Open Class” for the same
style of wine our 1965 Hunter River
Valley White Burgundy won a Gold
Medal and a Special Trophy for the
Best White Table Wine exhibited in the
show.
This particular wine, Bin 2790, was
sold during 1965 and 1966, except for
a quantity kept back for further matura-
tion and eventual later sale, some time
ahead.
Other prize-winning wines will be sold
in the future: for instance some of our
Gold Medal winning Champagne in the
“Open Champagne Class Any Vintage”
will be released for sale late this year
and our two Gold Medal winning Hunter
River Valley Burgundies in the “1967
Vintage Open Burgundy Class” will
eventually be sold when fully mature.
Given sufficient quality, the winning
of show awards is purely dependent
upon the individual judges’ preferences
for different styles, and so not every wine
we exhibit or sell wins a prize. This in
no way reduces or reflects on our wine—
perhaps it does on the judge—and we
grade, sell and/or reserve wines strictly
on our own judgment. When told the
identity of the champion white of the
show—Bin 2790 White Burgundy—one
man who sought to buy it on its per-
formance cried “But I did not know it
was such a good wine before.”
Fortunately we did, and reserved from
sale well over 1000 dozen quart bottles —
the minimum show quantity in the class
—not so much for show purposes as to
be able to offer for sale one day a
substantial quantity of superb old wine.
In the meanwhile we offer for sale the
following Hunter River Valley Whites,
both of which we have reserved for our-
selves quantities in excess of 1000 dozen
quarts.

A way to
harvest a crop
of troubles
SO YOU want to start your own
vineyard.
The French and the Italians simply
drink the stuff. Though over a quarter
of the men working in France are said
to be involved in the wine industry,
they tend to keep their feet on the
ground and are not swept up by the
hot air of wine rhetoric. They work at
it and they drink it. The British, on
the other hand, aspire. They write
about it, read about it, talk about it,
build great meals around it, form
societies and clubs, to discuss it. It’s
only when it comes to actually drinking
the stuff that the British fall down,
their per capita consumption being a
60th of the French and Italians and
even only half of ours.
Now Australians, realising how good
the stuff is and starting to get caught
up in the whole delightfully giddy
business, want to aspire, too. In spite
of the Australian’s notorious national
laziness, when he aspires, he aspires
pretty thoroughly. The wine books are
quickly read, the wine lectures are
rapidly absorbed, the current articles
are noted, cellars are established among
the lawnmowers and household junk,
and the wine collection grows. Indeed,
this is one of the major reasons for the
present shortage and the rapid rise in
the so-called consumption figures.
These are really sales figures and
include all the wine that is being
bought to put away. Let’s hope I’m
around when it’s put away properly.
But these activities are not enough
for some Australians who want to go
further and actually make the stuff.
And not just in the laundry out of
table grapes bought at the local mar-
ket. They want to start literally from
scratch; from the scratch in the soil
that marks the peg that straightens the
line that marks the row that takes the
plantings that grow into the vines that
bear the fruit that becomes the wine
that Jack made. And Kevin and Bill
and Nev.
It is hard to know just how many
are interested at the moment. It would
probably amaze us all. But the numbers
are undoubtedly quite large.
James Busby, the father of viticul-
ture in Australia and New Zealand,
probably started this do-it-yourself
attitude way back in the 1820 s, when
he wrote, “The man who could sit
under the shade of his own vine, with
his wife and children about him, and
the ripe clusters hanging within their
reach, in such a climate as this, and
not feel the highest enjoyment, is in-
capable of happiness and does not
know what the word means.”
The trouble is that “the highest
enjoyment” is likely to cost a lot more
than it did in those days.
To start with, there’s the price of the
land. There is little doubt that we have
soil and climate all over the place
quite suitable for grape-growing. Pre-
phylloxera Victoria had ten times more
land under vine than it has today. The
work that some major companies have
done recently in opening new areas
again confirms this view. Understand-
ably, much of this land will be cheaper
to buy than land in proven areas. But
the fired-with-enthusiasm amateur is
advised to sprinkle himself with the
cold water of financial realism. New
grape-area development, like oil
exploration, is for the big boys. We may
be the last frontier, but there’s no one
quite as broke as a bankrupt pioneer.
So the novice should turn toward
proven areas. What does he find? High
prices.
The Sydneysiders’ devotion to the
Hunter River Valley area has doubled
land prices there in the past five years.
It is difficult to generalise, but recently
a large block, some of it quite unsuit-
able for grapes, sold for $2OO per acre
inclusive and another block sold at
auction for $240 per acre.
Elsewhere things are even worse.
Coonawarra land is at a premium and
one gentleman was said to have asked
$lOOO for each acre of his top land. A
quite common price asked is $6OO per
acre.
In Griffith in the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area prices can be higher
still, since most of the farms with water
quotas have some grapes on them and
this is taken into consideration. I am
told that a good 60- to 70-acre farm
there with about 20 acres under vine
can bring as much as $BO,OOO, and I
know of one place bearing no vines that
sold for nearly $50,000. This is not far
off $lOOO dollars an acre. Yefc, when
yields and prices for grapes and wine
are considered, it may turn out to be the
'best financial proposition.
One area that impressed me was
Mudgee. I went there to visit Jack Roth
of Craigmoor Wines and saw his vine-
yards and those of Ferdie Roth and
Alf Kurtz. These vineyards were in
immaculate condition, among the best
I’ve ever seen, with strong, vigorous
wood and healthy grapes in abundance.
And land there could be bought for
$lOO an acre and even less. Don’t say
I didn’t tell you.
So you buy your 20 or 100 acres
and you start. Your financial worries
start, too. Say that for 20-odd acres you
need a tractor; and a post-hole borer,
and perhaps a trailer with water tank.

$2OO per acre.
Now where were we? We haven’t
planted any rootlings or cuttings yet.
They cost money, or perhaps we can
borrow some, or beg some, or pinch
some. We can’t labor. So be
hard-headed and write down $6OOO for
planting and care over the first two
years.
The accountants and bankers can
always dream up other expenses. Legal
fees I never met a good honest
wine-drinking solicitor yet rates and
taxes, insurances, workers’ compensa-
tion, repairs and maintenance, stamp
duty. Will it never end?
One day it does. And after two and
a half years there is a slight crop.
After five years the vines start to bear
reasonable fruit. Who is going to make
the wine? You, maybe, if you have the
great determination, intelligence, and
drive to give yourself the chance. Study
wine and wine-making methods for ten
years, live, eat, and sleep wine, work at
vintage with the wine-maker, remember
every useful word that’s ever said to
you, and you have a chance. Otherwise*
hire a wine-maker.
Wine-makers are beginning to cost
money, and I, for one, applaud the
move. For too long they have been the
most depressed class in a depressed
industry. Today $lO,OOO a year is a
salary within their reach. And you
must have a good wine-maker.
The winery, too, must be immaculate.
Presses and pumps, stainless-steel vats,
heat exchange, and filters, centrifuges,
and bottling lines. Money, money,
money.
Clearly no game for the tyro or the
dilettante. Still, a man with all it takes,
and the money, will not be daunted.
An outlay of $lOOO an acre for an
established vineyard, plus labor and
winery establishment costs, will eventu-
ally return big profits if present trends
continue. But 100 acres of top vineyard
could well cost $150,000 to $200,000
before there is any return. Yet the in-
centive remains. A hundred acres
means approximately 200 tons. Two
hundred tons means 25,000 gallons,
which means 150,000 bottles if the wine
is good enough. What good wine
doesn’t sell for $1 a bottle? And one
could surely make 20 percent after all
bottling costs, agents’ margins, and
bank repayments.
I don’t know. I just hope that this
has been some sort of guide. If I were
you I would join a syndicate that in-
cluded hard-headed professionals or
I would buy one acre and plant cut-
tings myself and enjoy the land and
make my own wine. It probably
wouldn’t be much good, but at least it
would be mine. Or I would forget the
whole thing and do as the British do
and talk about it, and discuss it, and
write about it, and read about it. Or
I would do as the French or the
Italians do just drink the stuff.

Balance of payments
The summary of the Australian
balance of payments over the last five
years given by J. C. Horsfall (8.,
March 23) may well give readers an
unjustifiably complacent view of the
recent state of our external accounts.
For the rise of $243 million in our re-
serves and other forms of international
liquidity over the period was much
more than accounted for by the rises
in the first two years amounting to
no less than $598 million. A more
accurate position of their recent state
is given by the fall of $355 million over
the past three complete years (an
averagte of $llB million a year). Even
this would have been worse but for the
quite unprecedented capital inflow of
1965-6—the only one of these years in
which there was a surplus (and then a
very small one).
The outcome for the current year
will also be obscured by a temporarily
high capital inflow. If one allows for
the probably much lower inflows to be
expected over the next year or two, as
recent and prospective British and
American measures have their effect, a
reasonable judgment would be that the
present normal state of our external
accounts (that is, its average state tak-
ing good years with bad) is a deficit
of something over $lOO million. The
fact that by taking an average of the
realised outcome over a longer period
in the past gives one a much more
favorable picture merely underlines its
tendency to deteriorate over the recent
past.

Great Moscow Circus
I wish to object to the review by
John Cargher (8., March 16) on “The
Great Moscow Circus.” The review gave
the impression that Mr. Cargher could
have been sitting on a nail throughout
the performance. Newspapers have been
high in praise of every aspect of this
circus program, and one point that
amazed me was the fact that this critic
makes no mention whatsoever of clown
Andre Nikolaev, who works so hard
during the intervals and is rated as one
of the best clowns in the world. Trying
to rate the Moscow Circus with other
circuses of the world won’t work, either.
Other circuses work as a compact family
unit, the Moscow Circus is actually a
collection of acts chosen from dozens of
various circuses throughout Russia.
Finally, Mr. Cargher puts the blame
on finance and says “what we see is
governed by sheer business economics.”
This means that in this respect Aus-
tralia is greater than the mighty
America and even richer. This stems
from the fact that the Soviet circuses
which have visited Australia in 1965
and 1968 have both been much stronger
in quantity and quality than similar
units which have visited the United
States. All of this only proves one thing
—critics who appear to know little about
the world of circus should be a little
more careful when they attempt a
review of same.

Backing away
Mr. Tracey’s letter (8., March 23)
on Backing Away From Britain was,
to my mind, correct only in one aspect,
i.e., your article did, in fact, reflect
the current Australian thought on
Britain.
Australians, whilst prepared to
accept the welcome British immigrants,
no longer regard them as cousins and
are no longer prepared to tolerate the
patronising comments so well illustrated
by the first paragraphs of Mr. Tracey’s
letter.
I would ask him to reflect as to why
exactly Britain has been bled white.
Could it possibly be that too many
Britons have expected too much for
too long from their country, recovering
from the devastating effects of a world
war, whilst their personal contribution
to it has been somewhat devoid of
national interest.
It is time Mr. Tracey woke up and
realised that his “national pride” is
blinding him to the fact that far more
Australians per population have given
their lives for Britain than Britons have
for this “colony,” and that the parsi-
monious British investment prior to
World War II in Australia could hardly
have caused Australians to “wax fat.”
Peter Hunter
Brisbane.
It is hard to believe that Mr. H. E.
Tracey is being serious when he says
in his letter (8., March 23), “Australia
has happily waxed fat whilst British
conscripts and British money kept it
secure.”
If he is seriops, one can only assume
that he is also very young, and not
very well read. Since he “can’t wait to
get back to Britain,” I wish him God-
speed, feeling that the realisation of his
ambition would be a matter of mutual
benefit.
In the Second Freedom War, better
known to the British as the Boer War,
I think that our troops fought on the
wrong side. The Australians did fight on
the right side in World War I, giving
Britain massive support in what was
above all a European war. In World
War 11, when the British were again
involved in what was basically a Euro-
pean war, Australia again came in with
massive support.

Australia was directly threatened, half
of our forces were overseas fighting
Britain’s war and our own security was
very seriously threatened. “British con-
scripts and British money” were not
able to do much for us then!
Today, Britain derives an income of
many hundreds of millions of pounds
annually from investment East of Suez.
When the pull-out becomes fact, it will
be left to Malaysia, Singapore, Aus-
tralia, and so, on to guarantee the
security of this investment. The British
will be happy so long as the cheques
keep rolling in, but should anything
in the future disrupt the cheque flow
no doubt the British will say that we
have let them down. That’s British
gratitude!

Art aesthetics
Mr. Brook (8., March 30) argues that
as no authoritative aesthetic criteria can
be applied to recent art no one can
raise the issue of the excellence or lack
of it in the Power Institute’s purchases.
It was unfortunate, therefore, that he
used the expression that no one “could
have done it better,” when degrees of
excellence in this issue were inapplic-
able. Mr. Brook argues that he is not,
however, claiming infallibility for Mr.
Thomson’s choice of purchases, but I
think the implication of infallibility is
there. What did Mr. Thomson think he
was buying if not true works of art?
If he was buying representative works,
surely he thought them representative
of trends in art? Does one really send
out a purchasing agent knowing that
no one can be sure in the area of recent
art? If it isn’t art when you buy it, how
does it become art?
Other issues: as for misunderstanding,
I think I see the consequences of Mr.
Brook’s views better than he; as for
malice does he think he writes so
clearly that anyone who misunder-
stands him is to be suspected of deliber-
ately doing so through malice? As for
generosity about Mr. Thomson’s pur-
chase Mr. Brook assured me by tele-
phone that he was not obliquely remark-
ing on the fact that I had been an
unsuccessful applicant for the Power
Curatorship under the aegis of which
Mr. Thomson bought the works. In
this case I just don’t understand what
Mr. Brook is implying.

Unfair to de Chardin
Do the readers of your excellent
magazine have to submit to reading
book reviews such as that of James
McAuley, entitled “one of the world’s
super-nuts,” if they wish to read your
magazine from cover to cover? I
haven’t read either of the books quoted
but have read de Chardin. I wonder
has Professor McAuley, or is he taking
his knowledge second-hand from some-
one else? To me, his article is not so
much a review of these two books as
the authors’ works, but an outcry from
his own soul to decry what one man
believed was possible and the truth.
I found no difficulty in following
de Chardin’s trend of thought and
appreciating his experience into the
unknown, any more than, over a hun-
dred years ago, I would have in follow-
ing the exploits of our early explorers
of the earth Australian and/or
otherwise. They made mistakes then as
I dare say so has Chardin, but they
opened up a new world that we in this
generation are appreciating and exploit-
ing to the full, and the mistakes of
early pioneers seem infinitesimal com-
pared with the success of their ven-
tures, and the outcome.
Let’s not brand everybody w'ho has
the guts to forge ahead into unknown
territory as super-nuts, but give them
a fair hearing and acknowledgement of
their courage. With the charity of a
Chardin I accorded Mr. McAuley this
when I read his article right through.

Hotels in the West
I enjoyed reading your supplement
on the West and think Wallace Crouch
and Richard Woldendorp did a fine job
in reporting what goes on, but I do
wish that they would not perpetuate
the myth that if something is a motel,
it is good, and if it is a hotel it is
bad.
Wallace Crouch makes kindly refer-
ence to what he calls “The Mount
Tom Price Motel.” In actual fact, it
is the Mount Tom Price Hotel, and
similarly at Dampier he talks about
the “Mermaid Motel,” whereas, in fact,
it is named The Mermaid Hotel, and
similarly “The Walkabout Motel” is
The Walkabout Hotel. Finally, he talks
about two new motels, and contrasts
them with the town’s two pubs.
It is true that the two old hotels
in the town are somewhat ramshackle,
and this is precisely the reason for the
appearance of the Hedland Hotel and
the Walkabout Hotel, and as the
managing director of the Swan Brewery
Co., which has expended approximately
$2,000,000 in building the new hotels
at Tom Price, Dampier, and Port
Hedland, I would have hoped your
people could have been a bit more
accurate in naming them.
Incidentally, in Western Australia,
it is not permissible to use the word
motel with respect to a hotel, and
neither is it permissible to have a bar
in a motel.
I do hope that in the future you
will accept the position that some
hotels are good, and that you will not
publish things which do not assist us
in our efforts to improve things in
general.

It matters to us because his name was Louis Renault. In 1898 a young
Frenchman was dissatisfied with belts and chains as the standard means
of transmitting power. The ruling system he reasoned was both noisy and
wasteful of power. Louis Renault invented the "Renault Box". The
world's first direct drive it incorporated three forward speeds and reverse.
This was one of the first rules Renault ever broke. Why don't you give your
spirit of adventure a chance try the 1968 rulebreaker..
