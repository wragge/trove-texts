THE NATIONAL AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPER
Registered in Australia for transmission by post as a newspaper.
OVER a million people each year visit the British Museum in
London—one of the world's great treasure houses, and one
which is unrivalled for the richness and variety of its contents.
This vast collection began wilh a public lottery in the 18th
; century which provided funds for the purchase of manuscripts
. collected by Sir Mans Sloane and Robert Harley. Subsequent
additions included the famous Elgin Maibles and the Egyptian
antiquities which arc housed in several great galleries. In one of
these, on the ground floor, and illustrated here, is the granite hear!,
nine feet high, and an arm of a colossal statue of Thof limes 111, who
reigned in Egypt about the year 1550 b.c. \
In the Egyptian galleries are displayed more than a thousand
pieces of sculpture which represent the work of artists over a period
*of 4,000 years. Pharaohs, priests, chancellors, scribes, librarians,
overseers and all the life of ancient Egypt are represented here in
one; form or another.
One of the most important exhibits is the famous Rosetta Stone,
hearing inscriptions' that became the key to the meaning of a lost
language and unlocked the history of ancient Egypt which previously
had been a closed book. The stone is a large slab of black basalt
and it was discovered by a chance stroke with a pick by one of
Napoleon’s soldiers in 1798. He was demolishing a wall of a fort
in the small village of Rosetta at the mouth of the Nile when his
pick dislodged the stone which he noticed bore inscriptions of three
different kinds. When deciphered it was discovered that the writing
was a decree in Greek, Demotic and Hieroglyphs, issued in
197-19(1 8.c., during the reign of Ptolemy V. The first man to
•grasp the meaning of hieroglyphics was Dr. Thomas Youtm, of
Somerset, who guessed that, like shorthand, the characters "were
based on the phonetic principle, and his readings from the Rosetta
Stone proved to be remarkably correct.

BLAKE'S LETTERS
A beautiful edition of The Letters
of William Blake (Rupert Hart-Davis)
has been edited by Sir Geoffrey
Keynes, editor of the Nonesuch Blake,
with a “Register” of the 151 letters,
their history, previous printings, source
of present text, etc.
A great many are now held in
America, causing Sir Geoffrey some
difficulty in getting transcriptions of
the accuracy and precision required by
editors in this dangerous land where a
word changed or omitted can become
a battlefield, as witness Lytton
Strachey’s essay on Blake; and some
of the letters have disappeared and are
represented by only a few lines used,
to intrigue bidders in auctioneers’ sale-
catalogues. Ten or eleven letters
acquired by the family of the present
Prime Minister of England have been
lost (cries of “Shame!” and “Resign!
Resign!”), and some of these might
have thrown a little more light on
Blake’s attitude to Hayley at the time
of their quarrel . . .
Part of Blake’s fame is that he was
one of the world’s most uncomfortably -
honest men; and it is in his letters that
this honesty is seen tried to the utmost,
because it is here that B)ake has to
try to rub along with the outside world
—he a man above all men who had
made his own world of the mind, where
everything moved to his wishes and
interpretation. In fact, in these letters
it is hard not to feel that Blake is
trimming a little, to placate people who
could give him engravings to do, and
to be nice, the most difficult of all
things, to the several people who went
out of their way to help him.
Seldom in the letters is there any
hint of the dreadful, mordant couplets
in which he relieved his feelings about
his friends and business associates.
When he writes to Hayley, for instance,
the kindly and well-to-do dilettante
who got. him to a seaside-cottage at
Felpham. he addresses him as “Leader
of My Angels” .(16/9/1780), and when
writing directly to Hayley he is always
Civil. When later they quarrel he does
mention, to his lifelong friend and
patron, Mr. Butts, that “by me late
firmness I have brought down
[Hayley’s] affected Loftiness,” and that
Hayley’s “imbecile attempts to depress
Me only deserve laughter”; but there is
no hint of the jotting in his manuscript-
book : : —
Of H ’s birth this was the
happy lot:
His mother on his father him begot,
or, again,
To H
Thy friendship oft has made my
heart to ache:
Do be my enemy—for friendship’s
sake.
The people who show themselves
most in these letters are the people
who write to him: Thomas Butts, chief
clerk in the Army office of the Muster-
Master General, and R. H. Cromek.
Butts bought Blake’s art so consistently
that his collection remained the largest
during the whole of the 19th century,
and many of the letters here are merely
receipts given by Blake for payments
made by Butts. • As the editor says
gently in his introduction, referring to
Butts’s letter of September, 1800, he
was “a dumb admirer of genius, which
he could see but did not quite under-
stand.” In another man the letter
would have been considered crude and
in.bad taste, but Blake saw no harm
where none was intended, and returned
the kindness and affection.
Cromek is represented by only one
letter, but rarely can any man have
sketched himself so brutally in one
short composition. Give him that
Blake had charged him with ‘lmposing
on him”'; then take the tone of his
reply:—■
“When I first called upon you I
found you without reputation; I
imposed on myself the labor, and a
herculean one it has been, to create
and establish a reputation for
y0u.... 1. also imposed on myself
when I believed what you so often
have told me, that your works were
equal, nay, superior, to a Raphael
or a Michael Angelo!... .your best
work, the illustrations of “The
Grave,” was produced when you
and Mrs. Blake were reduced so
low as to be obliged to live on half
a guinea a week.... ”
One can envisage Mr. Cromek preen-
ing himself among his acquaintances
upon having “ticked Blake off.” He
might have thought twice if he had
seen Blake’s couplet:—
A petty sneaking knave I knew —
O! Mr. Cr , how do ye do?
But if even Blake could not have the
same face for the world in public and
jn private, he did, by leaving his private
thoughts to be compared with his
public statements, show that it was
hardly possible. The reader is consoled
by this expression of human limita-
tions, the statement of which is the
main ebusiness of art.
And then there is the final, astonish-
ing letter from George' Richmond to
Samuel Palmer, August 15, 1827, on
Blake’s death: —
He died on Sunday night (12
August) at 6 o’clock in a most
glorious manner. He said He was
going to that Country he had all His
life wished to see & expressed
Himself Happy, hoping for Salva-
tion through Jesus Christ—Just
before he died His Countenance
became fair. His eyes Brighten’d
and He burst out into Singing of
the Things he saw in Heaven. In
truth He Died like a Saint as a
person who was standing by Him
Observed....
Seldom can the letters of a famous
letter-writer have been so. surpassed,in
interest by letters to him and about
him.
ON FROSTY DAYS
[In Memory of Jack Campbell]
On frosty days, when I was young,
I rode out early with the men
And mustered cattle till their long
Blue shadows covered half the plain;
And wheikwe turned our horses round,
Only the homestead’s point of light,
Men’s Cilices and the bridle-sound,
Were left in the enormous night.
And now again the sun has set
In yellow and a greening sky
Sucks up the color from the wheat.
Here are my horse, my dog and I;
And swans go west w ith brush of wings
And like a lamp one nightbird sings.
A.C.T.

Fruit For the Rubbish-tip
BETWEEN the State of Queensland
and the Sydney City Council the Labor
party is making a pretty exhibition of
itself—one which would be expected
to finish the career of any party based
on the support of a decent electorate.
There are no moral issues involved
inside the party in either of the fights
which are in progress. Self-preserva-
tion is the watchword.
In Sydney charges of corruption
have become a normal part of muni-
cipal life, equally with the blatant
measures taken by those in Labor
authority to suppress public inquiry.
And the expulsions of aldermen from
the A.L.P. at various times in Sydney
and Leichhardt speak for themselves.
If the A.L.P. knows enough about
an alderman’s municipal conduct to
expel him from the party —and nobody
can say the A.L.P. is over-fastidious —
then it seems that the A.L.P. is bound,
as the real government of the city, to
tell the public so that they can put him
out of office at the next elections or
force his retirement now.
The position at present, however, is
such that no inference can be drawn
that there is anything unscrupulous or
dishonest in the conduct of a man
simply because he has been ousted
from Labor ranks. So many members
have been thrown out for being too
scrupulous and for refusing to act in
a united front with the Communist
party, which the Australian Federal
conference has in the past described as
“a party of traitors out to destroy the
Australian way of life in the interests
of a foreign dictatorship.” that they
now form the solid nucleus of the
Democratic Labor Party.
The strange reticences of the Labor
caucus in connection with Sydney
Council charges, the reluctance to see
witnesses come forward and give their
evidence on oath, the privileged
slander of one potential witness by the
Lord Mayor, who made an accusa-
tion contained in his Worship’s sugges-
tion that the city solicitor was
considering whether the accuser, not
the aldermen he accused, should be
made to face a court, are all disturb-
ing. So is the careless, offhand
attitude of the Cahill Government.
Any alderman accused can clean
the whole business up by demanding
that specific charges be laid against him
in the open to give him the opportunity
of clearing his name of the smell of
corruption and rotten fruit. Then if
the charges against him are proved
to be malicious inventions without
foundation he has his legal redress,
and the accuser must deservedly suffer.
But, so far, neither the rulers of the
City Council nor accused aldermen
seem prepared to do anything but ask
the public to take their word for it
that they are all Simon Pures and the
victims of a long series of gross
slanders by wicked men.
These wicked slanderers have been
concentrated on the City Council
whenever Labor has achieved power
over the past 40 years. And on one
occasion they proved to be so right
that the council was temporarily
abolished because its members could
not be trusted to be honest.
The past history of the council,
indeed, is one of the most urgent
reasons why Alderman Jensen and his
fellows should not only permit, but
demand, a wide-open inquiry so as
to clear the names of all those against
whom charges are made.
Why they prefer to remain under
the suspicion which must be attached
to the controlling section of the
council as a whole so long as the facts
are not investigated either by a court
or by a public inquiry is something of
a mystery. Perhaps their sense of
their own righteousness is so innate
that they cannot believe anybody
would accuse them; or perhaps they
think that the public’s moral sense has
become so eroded that reputation,
apart from guilt, no longer matters.
The fall of the Queensland Govern-
ment centres round accusations just
as unsavory as those which have been
bandied about in Sydney—accusations
of bribery, impropriety and mere
chicanery, combined with party black-
mail to force the Government which
represents one bandit faction in Labor
politics to carry-out the will of another
faction for purposes of wholesale
electoral bribery in the shape of extra
annual leave, which the State cannot
afford in its present circumstances and
which the Government had to resist.
Gair did not reject the Q.C.E.’s
policy on three-weeks’ leave; he merely
refused to obey the edict to implement
it immediately. The refusal was
enough for the Bukowski faction, which
had been gunning for him ever since
he walked out of the Hobart confer-
ence over two years ago. Had he
knuckled-down on the leave-issue no
doubt another would have been found
—on the final night of the Parliament
the Duggan faction voted to a man
with the Liberal-Country party to
disallow regulations under the Oil Act,
for which they had expressed hearty
approval only a few weeks earlier.
Gair stood firm in the face of the
challenge and carried half the party,
including all but one of his Ministers,
with him into expulsion. But on the
score of political morals there is little
to choose between the two Labor
factions. In the degenerate one-House
Queensland “Parliament” they have
till now acted as a band of brothers
in gerrymandering the electorates and
promoting class interest—yet they
mutually became “scabs,” “Com-
munists,” “traitors” and “gullible
fools” the moment they fell out.
The two days’ exhibition of gutter-
tactics and abuse which constituted the
last “sittings” of the Queensland
Parliament should be enough to sicken
any electorate.
The Government remnant, for
instance, in order to buy the support of
the Liberals and the Country party
momentarily for its own purposes —
though these people are supposed to
represent everything that is loathsome
as the oppressors of the wretched toilers
—was even prepared to vote against all
precedent to give the minority parties
in the House the privilege of remain-
ing the official Opposition, while the
bunch of colleagues which until a few
weeks ago were all brothers and
virtuous were firmly excluded amid a
hail of mutual execrations, which
sounded like an exchange of compli-
ments in a “Red Ned” party in the
slums.
It is to be hoped that now the
electors have had their chance to see
what the Gair-Bukowski dictatorship
was made of they will not neglect their
opportunity —the kind of opportunity
that is being denied the citizens of
Sydney.
The right place for the species of
Labor which is governing Sydney and
Queensland, not less the sort which,
in the interests of self-preservation and
the collection of funds, is working in
a united front with the Communist
party in the Federal sphere, is certainly
not in office.
A strong, healthy, moderate Labor
party is a necessity in Australian
politics to represent a very large section
of the community.
But for the “topped-fruit” kind of
Labor which now controls the party
and the platform glittering with
expressed virtue on top and rotten
beneath the surface there is only one
place —the rubbish-tip.


"Huh! Lock up the turkeys. Here come those Pilgrim Fathers again!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Canadian Stalemate
The Canadian elections disturbed one of
the most stable political arrangements in
the British Commonwealth's history.
Under Mackenzie King, who ruled until
he chose to retire and Louis St. Laurent,
who took over from him, the Liberals
had been in office since 1935 and before
that, with a break of five years (1930-35)
during which R. B. Bennett was Prime
Minister, for a further reaching
back a decade.
At the dissolution the Liberals held
168 seats in the Commons out of 265,
the Progressive Conservatives 50, Co-
operative Commonwealth Federation —-
the equivalent of Labor operating on
Socialist principles—22 and Social Credit
—the much-changed descendants of
Aberhart’s Douglas Credit Party, which
has agreed to bury its strange financial
theories in a large generalised platform,
15.
The Liberals were at a disadvantage
in campaigning through the fact that the
Prime Minister is 75 and some other
Ministers ageing and suffering from the
disease of lassitude which often develops
in Ministers after many years in office.
Mr. Diefenbaker, who is 61, and who
is the only Conservative returned among
the 17 who sit for Saskatchewan, scored
(apart from having greater vigor and a
popular programme with a general
appeal) through being a better television
personality —TV for the first time was
a large feature of the campaigning.
He made 90 speeches and his policy
was based on five issues—the placing of
Canada first with closer liaison with the
U.K. and the end of U.S. economic
domination ; equal rights for all
Canadians ; taxation reduction, and the
restoration of the status and control over
public expenditure of Parliament.
Public-opinion polls which forecast
only a 3 per cent, gain for the Conserva-
tives were made to look foolish by the
result, which was crushing to the Govern-
ment, which lost 65 seats, including those
of nine out of 19 Ministers, among them
the 72-year-old C. D. Howe, who was
one of the great figures of the war effort
in World War 11, but who lost to a
C.C.F. man. All Ministers controlling
financial, defence and labor departments
were thrown out, but though Lester
Pearson got back, much of the silent vote
was probably attributable to resentment
at the Government’s desertion of Britain
and France and partial alignment with the
United States during the Suez crisis.
The Conservatives won 60 new seats
coming back with 110 ; the Liberals lost
65, result 103 seats ; the C.C.F. won 24,
a gain of two ; Social Credit, 19, also
gained. The voting represented for the
first time in history a transfer of the
balance of power to Western Canada.
No party has a working majority ; nor
could any two parties in coalition achieve
one except the Conservatives and the
Liberals. Any Ministry must operate with
early extinction and a new election in
view—a disturbing situation on the eve
of the Prime Ministers’ conference in
London, which will be short of Messrs.
Holland (N.Z.), Strijdom (S. Africa) and
probably Bandaranaike (Ceylon).
Budget Preparations
[From CanberraJ
As it is only a matter of days before the
daily newspapers begin their annual series
of speculative stories on the Budget, the
present is an ideal time to set the record
straight before too many people get
carried away with the possibility of tax-
cuts or other long-awaited concessions.
Federal Cabinet won’t get down to the
first of its Budget-preparation jneetings
until August 6, and isn’t likely to com-
plete the draft Budget until at least the
16th. Treasurer Sir Arthur Fadden will
introduce the document in the House of
Representatives on August 28, the day
after Parliament reassembles at the end
of the winter recess.
Bearing these dates in mind, the tax-
payer shouldn’t pin ail his hopes on the
promise of good Budget tidings in any
article he reads between now and August
6. There is every reason lor him to expect
nothing momentous in the forthcoming
Budget, which, even now, in its yet-
unborn stage, is being regarded in official
eyes as the “holding” Budget.
There is every logical ground for the
Government to produce a financial pro-
gramme designed to keep the national
economy in its present stable state, until
this time' next year, when preparations
for the 1958-59 Budget—the “election”
Budget—will be in train. It’s then that
we might anticipate a softening of the
Treasury heart and the granting of tax-
concessions. But such pleasant results
can accrue only if the 1957-58 Budget
limits itself to very minor concessions.
A.L.P. Sham Fight
So far as anybody knows what happened
at the N. S. Wales A.L.P. conference,
it seems to have been a victory for the
Left.
There was no real fight on the matter
of the executive for the coming year.
The sense of self-preservation which is
so marked in the careerists of the party
asserted itself, and the so-called Right-
wing industrial-group support, which
has been either Red-anted or hypnotised
by promised favors, allowed the Left-
wingers to have their way in return for
a few gnawed bones. They made no
attempt to oust Left-wing control and
offered no nominations. So the old
illegal executive, when the counting is
finished, will return to the saddle with
a rump of so-called Right-wingers who
can scarcely be told from the Lefts.
However, the conference showed no
tendency to swing closer to totalitarianism
by replacing the State-wide ballot for
the Senate with selection by the executive
and officers and two delegates from each
Federal electoral council. The executive
lost the vote by 341 to 337. Its excuse
for the proposed change was that those
honest fellows, the Federal M.P.s and
the Communists, were stacking the
branches.
While a number of delegates went out
for a quiet laugh Fred Campbell, the
president, said that many branch
members’ support of Labor was “doubt-
ful in the extreme.” He made an attack
on the Communists as “a cuckoo breed,”
which was somewhat unkind of him at
a moment when a party of junketing
Federal Labor M.P.s is off to China at
the cost of Mao Tse-tung.
“We will deal with the Communists
if they attempt to impose themselves on
us,” Campbell said sternly. “We are
not interested in unity with the Com-
munists.”
Possibly he felt safe with Dr. Evatt in
England and was unaware that branches
of unions which were thickly represented
at the conference were even now engaged
in united-front tactics with the Com-
munist party at union elections in
Victoria.
Campbell also said that the party would
“not tolerate any malpractice in the
Sydney City Council or anywhere else,”
and that the Labor party “will act with-
out respect of persons where it is shown
that malpractice exists.” However, they
are “not going to be stampeded by
rumors seized on by the press that are
designed to cast reflections on Labor’s
administration.”
An attempt by the executive to horn-in
on the Sydney City Council spoils by
taking over the selection of aldermanic
candidates from the city Labor leagues,
which were reported in the Sunday press
to be “already heavily under the
influence of barrowmen,” failed. This
was said to have “stunned Labor
observers.” They showed no signs of it.
Premier Cahill was, however, stunned
—despite the approval of his opera
house —by the decision to ask him to
reconsider the Governor’s pension of
£3OOO. He sounded so perturbed that it
has raised fresh speculation as to identity
of the next Governor —or the one after.
For Propaganda Only
Although John Galbally’s bill to restrict
interest to six per cent, under hire-
purchase agreements passed the Legisla-
tive Council in Victoria by a substantial
majority, because of the support of the
Country party, it was bound to be tossed
out in the Legislative Assembly, as
Galbally knew very well.
Galbally, who is one of Labor’s
younger hopes in Spring-street, is a clever
barrister, a novice M.P. who has learned
some wisdom in recent years and become
Leader of the Opposition in the Council.
He’s a star at playing to the political
gallery, and that’s all his bill was designed
to do.
The bill has been useful as a propa-
ganda weapon directed to the innocent
and ignorant poor against the banks,
which are always a safe target for men
who believe they’d be better bankers than
those' trained in the profession.
Just as reprehensible as Galbally’s pur-
pose has been the attitude of the Country
party, which has lost completely its
character in the Victorian Parliament and
was ready on this bill to desert its prin-
ciples for whatever cheap popularity could


be wrung from it, with the perfect
assurance that the bill would be defeated
in the Assembly by the L.C.P.
All the time Galbally and his C.P.
supporters were so frankly electioneering
in the Council, chiefly to tickle the ears
of the Parliamentary reporters, advertise-
ments were appearing in the financial
pages from national institutions seeking
funds.
While such firms as General Motors-
Holden’s subsidiaries have been offering
seven per cent, for money for a term,
Galbally has been haranguing the Council
on the right, in effect, of a teenager to
borrow money to buy a sports-car, or
similar expensive trinket, at a maximum
interest of six per cent.
It is undeniable that some interest-rates
on h.-p. agreements are too high—
especially on used cars, and Galbally was
not exaggerating overmuch when he said
a man buying a used car from some used-
car crooks needed two detectives and a
shrewd lawyer—but the general rates in
Victoria follow the market rate and, inex-
orably, the state of the money market.
The hypocrisy of the bill is exposed by
the fact that in neighboring N. S. Wales
a Labor Government recently passed an
Act to control interest on h.-p. agree-
ments, fixing a maximum rate varying
(depending on the type of goods) from 7
to 10 per cent. The difference is that
Premier Cahill, being in office, has to
stand by any bilis he puts through Parlia-
ment. Galbally, in Opposition, is spared
such a responsibility.
The Locum "Explains"
If Sir Arthur Fadden ever complained
about the burdens of office during the
now annual absences of the Prime
Minister he could justifiably claim to be
“the meat in the sandwich.” Invariably
his periods as Acting Prime Minister coin-
cide with patches of political excitement:
sometimes a national emergency like the
Korean War when the decision to send
Australian troops rested on his shoulders,
or local calamities such as floods and
bushfires. But the trouble this time is
quite different —it’s public antipathy to-
wards a Government which has just
granted M.P.s and senior public servants
increased pay.
Main criticism is directed against the
manner in which the increases were
granted—without debate, without the
normal announcement, without consult-
ing any kind of tribunal on the lines of
those so necessary before wage-rates can
be varied in the world outside politics.
To say the least, the Government’s atti-
tude to the whole issue has been anything
but the high-principled approach essential
to wage-justice.
Fadden, now in his seventh post-war
term as Acting Prime Minister (the terms
already amount to 18 months), is facing
the onslaught of public outcry, and with
great loyalty to his colleagues is doing his
utmost to defend the indefensible. There’s
a touch of irony in this, as it is whispered
that he spoke against the increases when
they were first mooted.
Why the Acting P.M. took special pains
at his press conference to justify the
Government’s action is beyond com-
prehension. No one cares about Sir
Arthur’s comparisons with executives in
private industry, how many fabulously:-
paid jobs Sir Roland Wilson and his
Treasury colleagues have been offered
outside the public service, or whether Sir
Giles Chippindail, as head of the Post
Office, works harder and longer than the
managing-director of a vast private-enter-
prise organisation. These are side-issues.
The public is annoyed because the
Government sneaked out the news of the
politicians’ rises on the eve of the Parlia-
mentary recess and waited until the
public-service rises had “leaked” before
making any statement. From begin-
ning to end the whole episode has
smacked of sharp practice.
Laurels to Trade
[From Canberra]
What’s wrong with our exporters? Where
private firms should be out hustling,
sending their sales-managers overseas and
generally doing everything feasible to
break into new and well-established
overseas markets we now find the Trade
Department in the vital leading role.
Why is this? Is it because our leading
exporting groups, most vocal a few
months ago about the difficulties of
“cracking” foreign markets, lack the
know-how? Or is it because they know
the Government is making a; desperate
bid to build-up our export-trade and is
prepared to spend Commonwealth money
to foster these markets?
There are potential markets for Aus-
tralia throughout the East, in Africa and
in South America. Yet the Trade Depart-
ment is doing all the promotion. Poten-
tial exporters are being pampered, hand-
fed with the do’s ana.aonts of this or
that country; in fact the Government
does all the “leg-work” for them gratis.
The latest Trade move is in new
markets interested in a variety of primary-
and secondary-industry goods at competi-
tive prices, and in tackling the problem
the public-service traders have adopted a
new outlook and are trying an entirely
new experiment. This' involves the
appointment of Trade Correspondents:
local businessmen who know the ropes
and, more important, the people.
The idea is that the Trade Correspon-
dent, who k responsible to the Australian
Trade Commissioner for the area, will
handle day-to-day inquiries for goods
which Australian firms might be able to
supply. He is not an accredited Aus-
tralian representative and if his appoint-
ment proves to be unwarranted the
Government loses no face if it terminates
the contract which keeps him watching
for Australia’s interests.
The first of the new T.C.s are to be
in Formosa, Kenya, and Uruguay. Each
of the three markets is developing rapidly
and offers Australia a ringside seat in
an expanding, healthy, two-way trade.
Formosa wants foodstuffs, wooltops and
some secondary goods, including
machinery and industrial plant. Kenya
wants some foodstuffs, a general range
of miscellaneous secondary goods, includ-
ing steel, building materials and general
merchandise. The new T.C. in
Nairobi is a retired Australian business-
man who has lived in Kenya for many
years and is in intimate contact with the
business community and the many Aus-
tralians who own valuable properties ici
the protectorate.
The market in Uruguay represents Aus-
tralia's first really organised effort to
break into South America, and even
though the correspondent will be littla
more than a contact point, as the nearest
Trade Commissioner is in Trinidad, it’s a
start.
The Trade Department hopes to put
trade-correspondents into more small
potential markets where a fully-fledged,
highly paid experienced officer could not
justify his time. Based on the adage that
little fish are sweet, this policy could add
several millions to our overseas earnings
in the next few years. And it was tne
brain-child of a bureaucrat!
A Press Knighthood
[From Melbourne]
For those to whom the decay of the press
is a frightening prospect, the bestowal of
a knighthood on Harold Alfred Maurice
(“Ham”) Campbell was particularly
pleasant news.
Campbell is one of the last of the old-
time editors who regard their tasks as
informing and uplifting duties, rather
than, as we have seen in the post-war
scramble for circulation, the cult of bad
taste and the trivial ; since he became
editor of the “Ag£” in 1939 it has been
possible for Melbourne people to pick up
the paper and find out what really
happened yesterday.
When he took over the editorship the
paper was addicted to street-urchin
politics, shouting rudely from the side-
lines, distorting the presentation of news
it didn’t like and always looking for
fight. Melbourne had become rather
bored with the “Age’s” old political gods
for breakfast, and, fortunately for the
Syrne family, owners of the paper,
Campbell transformed it into a true
news-sheet, reflecting his own urbanity
—and his good sense, too.
Canberra’s journalists and senior
public servants sum up Ham Campbell’s
place in the Australian scene when there
is a flap about the expense of sending
daily papers to Government agencies
abroad. If the Treasury is really in
earnest, and it comes down to one only
being sent, that one is the “Age.”
Born in Ballarat, Campbell had to go
far afield, to Perth “Daily News,” for his
early training in journalism. He was in
France with the A.1.F., briefly on Mel-
bourne “Herald” after the 1914-18 war
and became “Age” political writer in
1921, and, later, leader-writer.
Lately in hospital wherefrom he
walked convinced that nothing would
cheer him up so much as seeing his
favorite football-team, Melbourne, clean
up their opponents, Campbell was in New
York when his knighthood was announced
—on his way to London for the annual
meeting of Reuter’s.

ATOMIC REACTION
By IDA SCOTT-YOUNG
SYLVIA, flushing right to
her newly-cut fringe, and
under it, looked tantalis-
ingly up at me from
beneath her long mascara’d eye-
lashes.
“No, my dear old wreck,”
she said, “1 absolutely refuse to
marry you, so don’t be a dope
and keep on asking me. Any-
way, what do I want with a
husband?”
1 said I wouldn’t take that up
with her then and there, but I’d
lend her a book ab.out it if she
was interested.
She looked at me pityingly.
“You are quite a nice person in
a repulsive sort of
way, Sloany,” she
said. “But you lack
guts, if you know
what I mean. You
are too reminiscent
of the science
1 a‘b o r a t o r y. You
know stinks and
things. I’m fed-up
to the teeth with it.
Father lives for noth-
ing else, so am I
likely to marry into
it? I’
I wanted to snatch
her up and kiss her,
or deal her a kick
on the seat of her tartan pants ;
instead, I made a sound indica-
tive of reluctant resignation
and said, “Such disrespect is
very trying in one so young.”
“Not so very young,” she
said. “I’ll be nineteen soon.”
“Like hell you will,” I
snapped back at her. “In ten
months’ time.”
She flushed again and
flashed-out at me: “Anyway,
you are much too old to think
of marriage unless with some
horsefaced scientific spinster.”
That settled for the time
being, I retired deflated but not
convinced. I contend that I am
not too old to marry Sylvia. I
am thirty-odd, and the “odd”
is on the right side. Also, as
the lass is a bit lightweight on
the grey matter, and I like her
that way, my age and experi-
ence will balance things.
I hold a lectureship in
physics, so I am in the happy
position of being able to sup-
port a wife, and that is saying
something these days. Mind
you, I lay claim to none of the
heroic qualities, but can, when
pushed, get on with it, so
the “lack of guts” crack from
Sylvia was hard to take. Still,
I suppose I should have gone
on, hopelessly caring for her,
had it not been for the H-bomb
and the “yackity-yackity” from
the proletariat.
It was useless trying to con-
vince Sylvia and her pals that
my department only handled
the simpler form of radio-
active isotopes for hospital pur-
poses. Nothing would satisfy
Sylvia but that I should give
a talk at her house to some of
her friends of the “hep” set
who wanted to be wised-up so
that they could give with the
mouth themselves, now the
thing had cropped up.
Sylvia introduced me as a
nuclear expert, and they prac-
“I still say it's the Weather !"
tically mobbed me. “Do, do let
us j n to all the secrets,” they
begged, the females waving
their red-tipped talons vaguely
towards Woomera, Christmas
Island, Nevada and other test-
ing-grounds. Finally I broke
down—but only under extreme
pressure, mind you—and I
gave them a few simple facts
about the stuff I handled. Not
about H-bombs, of course, but
they would never know the
difference,
I gave them the lowdown on
the isotopes; how they were
artificially produced elements
which have the same qualities
as natural elements, but are
unstable, and are continually
radiating rays of different kinds,
which have various effects, and
that ultimately they will stop
doing so and come to the end
of their active life. And so on.
I paused after fifteen minutes
and looked about me. My
audience looked properly
stunned, poor devils . . .
Well, they asked for it. I
was about to launch myself
further into the matter when
a smart aleck, wearing a crew
haircut, corduroy-velvet slacks,
a shocking-pink pullover and a
dazed look, said loudly “Wow,
Charley!” and, leaning over the
back of his seat, turned-on a
hi-fi recording of Elvis Presley
singing “Love Me Tender.”
That was that. Sylvia told
me later that I did not make it
simple enough, but added that
she was sure they were all
impressed.
“Simple!” quoth I. “What I
told them could be understood
by any intelligent twelve-year-
old. How simple must one
get! Phooey!” I left in haste.
Suddenly it came to me that
if I played my cards right it
might make all the difference
with Sylvia. I reasoned that
if I could make her believe I
was in on the ground-floor in
the matter of the H-bomb tests
1 could capitalise on it.
I made a point of keeping
myself aloof, and let it get
about that I might be asked to
go as an observer to the
Maralinga tests. Also I made
a point of being seen much in
the company of one of my
feifiale colleagues, talking to
her out of the corner of my
mouth. Very hush-hush! In
fact I got quite worn-out with
the business. °
Then I got results. Sylvia
became restive. Missed me
to-ing and fro-ing no doubt.
Anyway, she telephoned to ask:
me round.
On my telling her that I had
a very important scientific
reason for not being available,
she replied: “So I noticed, and
I don’t think much of her.” She
rang-off in my ear.
1 was so bucked I went into
a pub and had a pint of beer.
Then I decided the time was
ripe for making my re-entry
into Sylvia’s life ; for, believe
it or not, I still wanted her.
I found the girl in an atmos-
phere of deep gloom sur-
rounded by all the latest books
on nuclear fission.
Her first words to me were:
“Oh! It’s you at last. Can you
tell me the meaning of the
phrase ‘Radon is very volatile,
having a half-life of only three
and a half days’?” I was
minded to laugh, but forbore
to do so just in time, for Sylvia
was eyeing me expectantly.
I felt desperate, it being
impossible to explain to one
unversed in the nuclear jargon.
Suddenly 1 had an inspiration.
“Wonderful Sylvia!” I said.
“That you should be sufficiently
interested to study my subject
—it gives me hope. Not many
girls would be intelligent
enough to understand it all.”
“Yes, it is all very difficult,
isn’t it, Sloany?”
I was sensible of a distinct
warmth in the atmosphere, and
I hastened to assure her of my
great regard for her erudition.
1 made a vow then and there
that I would keep all books of
a scientific nature under
lock-and-key once we were
married . . .
A week later Sylvia told me
that the whole subject of my
work just “dug” her. It
appeared that during the course
of her reading she had
uncovered the fact that the
radon- containers, when
expended, were intriguing
things called “seeds,” looking
like oval melon-seeds and
that they are made of gold.
So when I was slipping the
diamond solitaire on her pearl-
tipped digit, Sylvia told me
there was only one thing she
required to complete her bliss.
She wanted me to procure for
her charm-bracelet a few of
these expended seeds.
Made quite reckless by the
occasion I said “I thought it a
pretty conceit,” and I promised
I’d see what I could do.


POLITICAL POINTS
One-time Queensland Speaker, 82-year-
old William Bertram, who collapsed and
died while on his way to attend —as a
spectator —the final sitting of the Gair
Parliament, saw many stormy and undig-
nified scenes in the House during his
Speakership, which lasted from 1920-
1929. But perhaps it was just as well the
old boy was spared last week’s spectacle.
• •
A few more H-bombs and Christmas

graphers as Ex-mas Island.

“Co-axial cable to run between Sydney
and Melbourne, via Canberra.” This
will probably mean the early televising of
Federal Parliamentary debates. That, in
turn, could well mean the early axing by
the viewers of some members who at
present are (sometimes) heard, but never
seen.
• •
Premier Cahill is reported to be ready
to sign the long-delayed agreement on
the operation and allocation of power
and water from the Snowy Mountains
Scheme after some sharp prodding by
the Commonwealth’s National Develop-
ment Department. The draft agreement,
which determines the amounts of
power and water to be shared annually
by the Commonwealth, N. S. Wales and
Victoria, has been resting in the pigeon-
holes of the N.S.W. Attorney-General’s
department for several months. Despite
periodical complaints by Victoria that
its share of power from the scheme is
too little, the Federal Government is
confident Bolte is now ready to sign.
Details of the agreement are expected to
be made available within a few weeks.
• •
For a year or two, Roy Jackson has
been the eighth in the Lab. Anti-Comm.
team which has controlled Richmond
Council over the A.L.P.’s seven. Now he
has resigned from the Anti.-Comms. and
holds the balance of power.
Obviously Jackson’s been watching
the manoeuvres of the Country party in
the Victorian Assembly, which seems to
have accepted the precept of Bismarck:.
Resign and Rule.
• •
Independent Aikens, from Munding-
burra, told the Queensland Assembly that
in turning up for the “funeral” he had
hoped to see some semblance of dignity,
but had been disappointed. This was
rather rich, coming from Aikens. In
recent years no one has contributed less
to the dignity of the House than he. But
last week’s slather-and-whack, with even
the Speaker getting down to gutter-terms,
must have made even the man from Mun-
dingburra seem a little dignified. It’s all
a matter of standards.
• •
The first of the Budget preparations will
get under way at the end of this month
when preliminary departmental estimates
for 1957-58 are submitted to the Treasury,
together with detailed lists of the current
year’s expenditure. The next move will be
for Fadden to follow tradition by reject-
ing most of the preliminary estimates and
appealing to Ministers and their depart-
mental heads to prune their planned
spending in the interests of the national
economy.
Thwarting Fadden’s consistent efforts
to reduce departmental spending to a
reasonable level is the quaint public-
service custom which gives greater recog-
nition to a big spender than to a thrifty
administrative genius.
• •
“M.1.A.”: What is the future of rice-
growing in Australia? The Humpty Doo
(N.T.) people, or at any rate the American
section of them, are talking in terms of
tens of thousands of acres, mills in Hong
Kong and elsewhere and a couple of
bumper crops a year—wild geese and
other natural pests permitting. Is the
market in Asia, present and prospective,
as good as it is made out to be? What
will be the effect of the N.T. venture on
the highly efficient industry of the Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Area, both on the
home market, the market for supplying
New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, and
this often-mentioned Asian prospect?
Most of the Asian countries have been
trying to become self-sufficient in rice
since the war. Some have succeeded and
have surpluses which they are selling to
their neighbors; Growers, investors and
a lot of other people would like some
authoritative views on the subject.

“Gnasher Ali”: Who started the yam
that the “Doc.” might try to pose as a
world peace-maker by acting as an inter-
mediary between Jerusalem and Cairo?
Did one of Evatt’s friends suggest that
Bert might succeed where Bob had failed,
or did someone inside his deeply-riven
party see a chance to drive a few more
nails into his political coffin? One thing
is certain. Australian Jewry has been very
conscious of all the Menzies Government
has done for the- cause of Israel in the
last year, and has not been tempted in any
way to “approach” Evatt on the subject.
Anyway, whom could the Doc. claim to
“represent” at the moment, in Britain, in
Israel, in Egypt, or anywhere else?
Certainly not “Australian Labor.”
The last action of the 34th Queensland
Parliament, after the Gair Government
had been defeated by 45 votes to 25
the two Independents voting with the
Liberal-Country-party Opposition and the
A.L.P. —was the disallowance of two
proclamations issued by the Government
on May 11, requiring all petrol whole-
salers and retailers to register under the
Motor Spirits Distribution Act by August
1. The proclamations were the first step
towards implementing the much-disputed
Oil Bill. Former Liberal-leader Hiley
moved for their disallowance, claiming
that such matters should be left for the
incoming Government to consider.
Health Minister Moore (Q.L.P.) pro-
tested that those opposed to the Govern-
ment had started viciously interfering
with the rights of Parliament “after only
one minute in authority.” He must have
meant the rights of the Gairs. After all,
it is the right of Parliament to disallow
any regulation it disapproves—and that
is what Parliament did —by 43 votes to
24.

A P.M.G. spokesman in Brisbane ex-
plained the department’s use of envelopes
bearing a war-time slogan by saying they
were used in the interests of economy and
that it would be wasteful to destroy stocks
of usable envelopes. So it would, but
what sort of economy was it that ordered,
in war-time, sufficient stocks of envelopes
to last until 12 years after the war was
over?
• •
Remember how the Federal Govern-
ment was going to abrogate its extradition
treaties with Communist - controlled
Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Rumania, and Yugoslavia? The
object was to prevent any New Australian
from going through the agonies, experi-
enced by Yugoslav migrant Bogoljub
Rancic, almost -shanghaied back to his
birthplace to answer a trumped-up theft
charge. The Yugoslav Government
demanded his return under the terms of a
50-year-old extradition treaty with Serbia.
After nearly seven months of legal
thought it looks as if the Attorney
General’s Department is going to claim
that the difficulties involved in revoking
the treaties are “insuperable.”
Arguments likely to be quoted run
something like this: The Rancic case
set a precedent through which the Com-
monwealth could always protect New
Australians naturalised or not; civil
criminals, perhaps murderers or thieves,
from Communist satellites could find a
haven in Australia; an Australian
criminal could flee to a Communist
country and we could not demand his
return.
The Government is now convinced that
abrogation of the treaties could have
such embarrassing results that Australia
would look ridiculous internationally.
Legal opinion is that New Australians
have complete protection already, but this
point is not likely to be canvassed, as the
Government hopes to let the whole
matter die.


Gair is still keeping that election-date
under his hat. P’raps he’s not going to

If the Labor executive in N. S. Wales had
any time on Sunday morning to glance
at the Sydney “Sun-Herald’s” report
of their proceedings on the opening day
of their conference, they must have been
a little startled to find that they had
committed themselves to supporting the
Q. in the coming Queensland election.
Granny’s Sunday sister apparently wasn’t
aware that “Queensland Labor Party”
now means Gair and the two dozen
members who stuck to him when he was
tossed out by the A.L.P. executive.

When Acting Prime Minister Fadden
closes the outlet gates of the Adaminaby
dam next Saturday the new reservoir,
one of the major works of the Snowy
Mountains Scheme, will begin to fill. At
full capacity it will hold eight times as
much water as Sydney Harbor. The
dam wall is only half completed, but
there’s no fear of the rising water-level
catching-up with it at the present rate of
progress of the work. Contract time for
the job was four years and it’s expected
to be finished in half that.

Complications are already cropping-up
in the anti-Labor campaign for shaky
Labor seats in Queensland. Under first-
past-the-post there are many seats that
should be a soft cop for a Lib. or C.P.
man with the Labor vote split in two.
But if an Independent enters the field
the position becomes very open again.
This has already happened in
Toowoomba, Duggan’s seat, where a
woman candidate, Alderman Vera
Lacaze, has nominated as an Independent
Liberal. It could happen in Keppel, too.
On Friday the Mayor of Rockhampton,
R. B. Pilbeam, who almost won Rock-
hampton as a Liberal at the last election,
announced his intention of running as
an Independent. This faces the Opposi-
tion parties with a poser. It is unlikely
that they could win the seat against two
Labor men and an Independent. On the
other hand, if they decide not to run a
candidate Pilbeam will be an odds-on
favorite, and in the new Parliament they
could count on his support on most
issues. Discretion suggests that they leave
the field to Pilbeam. The same situation
could easily arise in other seats, and
needs careful handling.
• •
N. S. Wales Labor Council has decided
that if the Federal Government sells its
three N. S. Wales coalmines it will direct
trade-unionists not to work in them. A
few months ago the same mob were
shrieking “Crisis” because a couple of
inefficient pits had been closed. Now
they’re threatening to close three modern,
profitable mines just to demonstrate their
belief in Government ownership.
The Immigration Department stole a
march on the Sydney “Herald” with the
publication last week of a little green
booklet entitled “Australia Unlimited” —
by a coincidence, the same title as the
“Herald’s” 32-page supplement arranged
for today. Immigration’s publicity section
has packed the little booklet with easy-
to-read facts on the unparalleled record
of expansion Australia is achieving
through immigration. It makes these
points: Since 1948-49 Australia’s popu-
lation has grown from 7.8 million to
9.5 million ; since 1947 migration has
provided four of every five new workers
in the net-increase of the work-forge ; at
least one-third of all new buildings are
being built by skilled migrant trades-
men ; Australia is eighth in world
production of motor-vehicles, and 40
per cent, of workers in the industry are
migrants.

Burdekin high-level bridge, ten years
in the building, was officially opened by
Queensland Premier Gair on Saturday.
It is 900 ft. longer than the Hawkesbury

between the two factions of the party
Gair led till a few weeks ago.

A British Labor manifesto on colonial
policy says that colonial people cannot
solve their problems by living on doles
—“they must increase their national
wealth by increasing their productivity.”
That doesn’t apply only to colonial
people.
A party of Dutch Parliamentarians is
to visit West New Guinea in August,
spending nearly a month there. It would
be a good idea if the Federal Government
invited the party to visit Papua and
Australian New Guinea while it is in
that part of the world. Australia has
indicated at the U.N. its support for
continued Dutch control of the western
end of the island, and the more co-opera-
tion there is between our Administration
and that of Netherlands New Guinea the
better for all concerned.

“W.P.T.”: Rumors are again afoot
that the Doc. may change his Barton
electorate for a safer seat. He can point
to plenty of precedents for doing so,
even among the great. Billy Hughes
changed from West Sydney to Bendigo
and then to North Sydney, finishing up
in Bradfield. But Henry Park.es must
hold the Australian, if not the world,
record. He sat for Sydney City, Cumber-
land North Riding, East Sydney, Kiama,

Mudgee, East Sydney, Canterbury, East

“In a 8.8. C. television interview Dr. Evatt

main causes of trouble in the Australian Labor

“A disjointing 1 frankly admit;
I allow there’s a breach, a rift, a division ;
A fracture, a rupture, a cracking, a
fission —
But l strongly deny there's a split!”

preserve the rich assortment of Aus-
tralian economic history which often
gathers dust in forgotten corners ; and,
in short, it provides a meeting-place for
businessman and historian. The new
chairman was born at Dunedin (N.Z.) in
1898, went into the motor business, first
with the Studebaker Corporation, then
with Garratts, Ltd., in Sydney and Bris-

From “Ek Dum”:
Brigadier Gordon Edward Manchester, who
passed on last week at 72, was an old-school
R.A.A. officer who learned his artillery the
hard pre-World-Wair-I way. His job was always
with the “heavies” and took him to outlying
parts of Australia in his early days.
He was kept at Thursday Island, a crucial
point in the sea-raider war, till 1917, when he
went overseas to command 55th Siege Battery
and, for'a time, the 36th Heavy Brigade, A.I.F.
In later years he was Director, Artillery and
Ordnance A.H.Q., Tasmanian Commandant
(1940-42), and held various important civil-
defence jobs during World War 11.
A very human, vital soldier, he knew
about everybody and everything in the
Australian defence world over half a century,
and when he and his crony the late
“Piero” Fiaschi, and another of them, John
Webb, then editor of The Bulletin, got together


his anecdotes were apt to develop a verve and
range which even Kipling could have admired.
He was a kindly man, much loved in a wide
circle of military good-fellowship.

knocking around the Northern Territory
for just-on 40 years now, since he came
back from War I, and has become a
leading authority on N.T. aborigines and
BUSHMAN-A UTHOR
perhaps the best-known Territorian.
A few weeks ago Harney decided to
leave his hut among the banyan-trees on
the secluded beach at Two Fella Creek,
near Darwin, to take on the lonely job
of warden at Ayers Rock, 200 miles
south-west of Alice Springs, where
vandals had defiled invaluable abo. draw-

best part of his life. Born in England, he
arrived at Darwin as a boy (in a ship
chartered by his uncle, Kit Freer, to
bring families to Australia), and through-
out his life considered Darwin the gate-
way to Australia. He hunted buffalo and
crocodile, exporting the hides, horns and
crocodile-skins to Turkey, rode at Darwin
Cup meetings—he won the Cup 13 times

the departmental heads. Finally a Minis-
terial ruling was made in Sneddon’s
favor. A Mines Department inspector
for 10 years on the northern coalfields,
Jock had been a leading federation
official in the long 1929-30 stoppage—-
Rothbury and all that. Began work in
a Scottish pit at the age of 12, took his
manager’s “ticket” after study at New-
castle Tech., and played a leading part
in winning long-service leave for miners.
Ironically, he misses-out on long-service

ABORIGINALITIES
“Clio”: The Technological Museum at
Bathurst (N.S.W.) houses a ship’s spar,
which, according to the legend attached,
was brought to the interior by the con-
victs who built the first road over the
mountains. The spar, which is still in
good condition, was carried between two
lines of convicts, all of whom were
manacled to it, preventing escapes. It has
never been explained why a valuable
ship-timber should have been brought to
the inland when the bush was full of
timber that would have served.the same
purpose—that is, a peripatetic clink.

“Sanasi”: I’d say, as an ex-magistrate
of New Guinea, that the newly-decreed
necessity to get a permit to purchase
metho (B. 15/5/’57) won’t unduly in-
commode booze-loving natives, especially
those in the Fly River area. At Daru
I had a police-sergeant who was perpetu-
ally half-sozzled and red of eye. His
tipple was gamada, which is the Poly-
nesian kava. When his home-supplies
ran short the old scoundrel would take
a gang of prisoners to the foreshore,
ostensibly to rake-up and burn leaves and
litter; the smoke-signals gave the main-
land suppliers the office, and next day
Sgt. M. would again be half-full. Latterly
gamada has gone out of fashion ; the
shot is now juba, a mixture of the fer-
mented juice of tapped palm-spathes
(Caryota urens ) with the local lime-
water ( sipora ). Metho, if available, may
be added, but the usual “additives” are a
spot of dark-tan boot-polish and a
soupfon of soap, to give the tipple a collar:
Also from the same toddy-palm the
potent jaggery is brewed —hence, to go
on the “jag.”

“Salmon Gums”: Clearers in the drier
parts of the Westralian wheatbelt
occasionally used to come across a
“weeping” jam-tree, and some of the old-
timers sank a lot of hard- work in the
effort to prove that the unusual formation
of the branches indicated an underground
stream. I’ve seen a lot of dry-wells put
down that way, and I’ve come to accept
the scientific view that the old belief is
off the beam. By the same token, I’ve
never heard a satisfactory scientific
explanation of why those tjees “weep.”
They’re perfectly healthy, and in every
other respect normal.

“Ailsey”: The Sandy Hollow-Mary-
vale railway, which the N.S.W. Govern-
ment started before the last war and
didn’t finish, may bring in some revenue
now the Railway Department is calling
tenders for the letting of two tunnels on
the unfinished line for the growing of
mushrooms. The Sydney “Herald” with
delicate irony ran the ad.- under “Factories
to Let.” But there’s no better way of
growing mushrooms; several disused
railway-tunnels near Lithgow (N.S.W.)
are rented by mushroom-growers.

“Liewahlo”: We were walking down
the road to the Bundaberg wharves when
a foot-long grass-snake shot out of the
bladey-grass on one side of an embank-
ment, twined itself in and out of our
feet, and tore into the bladey on the other
side. “Well, I’ll be damned!” said our
Englishman, only six weeks here. “The
first snake I’ve ever seen in my life, and
it had to be on a bitumen street in a
town!”

“Gravelsnatcher”: Nestlings grow at an
unbelievable rate, doubling their weight
every 24 hours and attaining full size
often in about 10 days ; so by the time
they’re flying they appear as big as adults.
Sometimes the color-pattern may denote
the juvenile, but in a great many cases
this isn’t a guide, because the young
adopt the coloring of the female. A
notable example of this is the blue-wren,
which has the reputation of being a
polygamist because one male is often
seen in company with a group of apparent
females; but actually his “harem” is
merely his family, probably including
OCEAN MINERALS, N.L.
[To my mate Pat at Lake Cargelligo.]
The Gold Coast's got me mining
And will not let me go —
And how are things with you, Pat,
At Lake Cargelligo ?
Well, there’s tin enough in Queensland
To cheer the likes of me
And H 2 Ti 03 spills over to the sea.
So it’s up and drink one down, Pat,
To Billington and Hack —
They’ve formed a small propriet’ry
To pump the ocean back;
They’ve pegged the blooming sea-bed
For eighteen hundred miles
And we’re going to pump the ocean
From here to Frazer Isles.
The Navy’s struck the mineral
And struck it rich and deep
And there we’re going to winnow.
And there were going to reap;
And when it gets too deep, Pat,
As deep it’s like to be,
We’ll pull the blooming plugs out
And siphon off the sea!
So it’s bag another bag, Pat,
For Billington and Hack —
They’ve sold the sea-bed forward.
And as the tide runs back,
Allowing extra foreshore
For what we’ve took away,
We’ll raise a greater Brisbane
All over More ton Bay.
I’ve housed it on a hill, Pat,
And watch green fields below,
The way we used to do, Pat,
At old Cargelligo —
Like furrows and like lands, Pat,
As Springfield's used to be
But here the ancient plough, Pat,
Configurates the sea.
Well, up and drink our wealth, Pat;
I’ll keep me word and shout —
But if it’s at the Lake, Pat,
You’d better leave me out;
For work of Harry Rankine
And Billington and Hack
I’m sold on spot to Queensland
And can’t be coming back.

HENRY LAWSON'S MATE
TjUHILE collecting folk-songs at Mudgee
(N.S.W.) recently I heard stories
about an old mate of Henry Lawson,
one Paddy O’Rourke, better known to
the locals as “Paddy
the Rook.”
Until his death in
1950 Paddy lived in
a little white hut at
the end of a quince-
tree avenue on the
property of Bruce
Merrin.
He went from pub
to pub, reciting his
own ballads and
Lawson’s, and
peddled his unusual
wares, which are
quickly becoming
collector’s items in
the Mudgee district.
Paddy’s stock - in-
trade consisted of
watercolor sketches
and hand - painted
brooches of Mount
Buckaroo, and of
Lawson’s old home
at Eurunderie, and a
series of striking
little wood-carvings.
The wood - carv-
ings were of rosella-
parrots, horses’
heads, and of
Paddy’s hero, Law-
son. Some of them
are on small plaques
and brooches, but
the best examples, perhaps, and those
most treasured, are the Lawson-head
whip-handles (part of one is here
reproduced).
Ernie Sibley, a ballad-reciter whom I
recorded, had one of these ; another is
in the possession of Father Maher, the
local Catholic priest.
Probably Paddy’s masterpiece would
be a pair of carved chairs owned by
Bruce Merrin.

Lawson’s birth.]

males which haven’t attained their dis-
tinctive coloration—they don’t become

You’ll ometimes see magpies and kooka-
burras ieeding and educating their young,
but these birds are comparatively tame
and haunt human habitations. See a flock
of either in the open and you’ll find it
hard to pick the kids. So “The Red
Dam” (B. 22/5/’57) may have seen plenty
of young crows without knowing it.
* * * *
“Phil Anthus”: Surely we can do
better than dismiss as “a man named
Brown” (B. 29/5/’57) the botanist who
was with Flinders in Bass Strait in 1802.
Robert Brown, Scottish-born naturalist,
was in effect the “father” of Australian
botany and a good all-rounder to boot.
He remained in this country for the best
part of four years, and in that time
travelled widely and did a vast amount
of valuable work. Later he was librarian
to the “king of New Holland” (Banks)
and later again keeper of the botanical
collections in the British Museum.
“They don't build anthills like they used to."
Probably the wombat Brown took to
Britain was the first of its kind to go on
tour, but several years earlier a spirit
specimen from the same area (Bass
Strait) had reached London through the
medium of Governor Hunter. Bass and
Flinders had brought this specimen alive
to Sydney and it had been given residence
at Government House. There the scien-
tific-minded Governor made detailed
notes on its behavior, and when it died
he ensured that London zoologists should
have a chance to study its anatomy.
“Brick E.”: One of the extra snags when
demolishing an old building is protecting
a public that patently doesn’t want to be
protected. Barrier-rails, danger-signs,
warning-notices—pfff! And there are few
things quite so nerve-shattering as the
sight of somebody blissfully meandering
along at the very spot where you dropped
the last length of hardwood and are
about to drop another. Which was why
the new laborer, fresh from the bush,
opened-up on a pair casually chatting in
the danger-zone below: “Listen, d’youse
two think you’re kookaburras?” “What
do you mean?” asked the man stiffly.
“Well, kookaburras are protected,” came
the drawl from above ; “and by cripes,
you’ll want to be, too, if y’ keep standin’
there! ”

“C. Coral”: An 8001 b. Luth turtle
picked up off East Sandy Cape by two
Bridport fishermen and towed into that
north-eastern port is only the second big
specimen to be found in Tasmanian
waters. The last one, now in the Hobart
Museum, was found in 1889. Laun-
ceston’s Museum authorities now have the
latest catch, which will provide important
scientific data. The Luth ( Dermochelys
caricacea ) is the largest of the turtle-
family, weighing up to two-thirds of a ton,
but instead of the plated shell of other
varieties it has a slate-colored leathery
back carrying five ridges. In Torres
Straits the Luth is known to the islanders
as Zigneipur, but doesn’t figure on the
menu, the flesh having the reputation of
being poisonous at certain times of the
year. Island boys told rrte they were never
able to locate the nests of the big fellows,
an unusual failure among such close
observers of nature.
* *
“Sackville”: It is common to see in
the wake of a bushfire two varieties of
tree with trunks unmarked, although their
foliage may be seared and dead—blue-
gum and spotted-gum, of course. Their
immunity is a matter of bark and of
season. The smooth bark of the gums
offers no ends, no frayed “wicks” which
give the flames the first hold that sends
them flying up the tree. When a. gum is
shedding its bark, however, *the long
hanging strips offer a perfect combustion-
point. But the first trees to show clean,
unblemished bark after a bad fire will be
the spotted- and the bluegum.
* * * *
“Jacana”: A modish miss visiting our
dairyfarm rose bright and early, eager to
help with milking. Mother, calling on
her in her bedroom, suggested that since
the men were already down at the yards
she could quite safely come to breakfast
as she was, without a dressing gown. The
young lady explained that those were
not pyjamas but matador-pants—just
right for farm-life. Our cows have not
quite recovered, nor has the young lady.
* * * *
“Doric”: Was surprised that an Aus-
tralian candidate in a radio-quiz didn’t
know what a geebung was. Evidently it
is only elderly people who knew the
childhood delights of hunting for this
native fruit in the bushlands around
Sydney, most of which have become busy
shopping and residential areas. It had
not much flavor and was rather
astringent ; a more succulent berry was
the “five-corner,” but I can never see
any sign of the bush that bears them,
even in the outlying countryside.
* * * #
“Clio”: The British standard rail-
gauge of 4ft. Byin., which is used in
N.S.W. and on the Commonwealth
railways, was set at that figure through
an engineering error. When George
Stephenson was making his first steam-
locomotive experiments he decided on a
width of 4ft. 9in., not because it had any
special merit, but because that was the
gauge of the wooden lines in the coal-
mines of his native northern England.
Stephenson,-believing that a flanged steel
wheel running on a steel rail would not
perform satisfactorily unless it had some
play, set the gauge of his engine at
4ft. B|in. to allow for this. The theory
proved wrong, as his loco, developed too
much oscillation when travelling at speed.
To retrieve his error Stephenson moved
one rail half-an-inch closer in rather than
change the dimensions of the engine:
thus the 4ft. 84in. gauge came into being.

LATEST item in the equipment of the
resolute bird-photographer is a tape-
recorder. Making a record of a bird
calling at a discreet distance he plays it
back, whereupon the bird comes dashing
up with the fixed idea of routing a
supposed intruder in his domain, and so
becomes an easy subject for the camera.
As well, tape is being used to record the
voices of birdmen. When visiting Rock-
hampton recently Sydney naturalist-
photographer Norman Chaffer made a
tape-recording of a story in which Harry
Barnard told how the famous golden
bower-bird of North Queensland was dis-
covered. That happened in 1889. Barnard
was then a member of an exploratory
party led by Archie Meston, and it was
from him that Meston grabbed a gun and
shot the beautiful bird. Apart from the
interest of the tale itself, the recording has
value in that Harry Barnard, a product
of Coomooboolaroo station in Central
Queensland, is among the most notable
and (at the age of 88) one of the oldest
of Australia’s birdmen. —“Meliphaga.”

“Kelms”: It isn’t their gliding that
makes the flight of owls so silent (B.
22/5/’57). It’s as “Time” says —they're
equipped with special, soft, wing-feathers
which almost completely muffle the sound
of their passage. Matter of fact, they
don’t glide to any extent, except when
pouncing on their prey ; the impression
of gliding is created by their silence.
Watch one on £ moonlight night and
you’ll see the wing-movement, which is
probably as rapid as that of the magpie
and carries the bird as fast. Watching
that, I get the impression of velvet.

“J.R.”: The car had sped through the
prosperous Isis district (Q.), through
acres of sugarcane (standing well despite
drought), past endless red-soil farms
reminiscent of the Atherton tableland,
each with its attractive home and modern
farm-equipment. Twenty minutes later
it passed a hungry-looking patch of virgin
bush, a butterbox-shack, and a solitary
toiler, who with hands and axe was clear-
ing preparatory to burning-off. The con-
trast between lush prosperity and stark
pioneering was painful, “Poor cow! ”
breathed one of the party. He leaned
from the window and tossed a box of
matches at the feet of the toiler. “Good
luck, mate!” he called. “These'll save
you rubbing firesticks together, anyway.”
COASTAL DIET
THE human palate can become tired
of all things, but to those born of
generations of meat-eaters the most irk-
some of food is a very long diet of fish.
We had been around the N.T. coast for
months, and the salted beef in the deep
barrel had taken on the colors and the
designs of a Dali “masterpiece.” We had
cooked it in curry until the poor, bruised
piece of beast took on the general color
of an old Chinese. It had been our only
escape from grilled, fried, boiled,
fricasseed pumpkin-headed white-fish,
barramundi, and all other things that live
in the warmer seas.
At dusk one day the millions of flying-
foxes were blacking-out the sky as they
flew to other eating-grounds. Our natives’
faces lighted up with the possibilities of
a new diet. “Shootem, boss! Shootem!”
A few shots with a gun, and there were
plenty of flying-foxes to change the diet.
The abos stuck a green stick in them and
grilled them for a split-minute, demolish-
ing in the fire the outside of the wing
membrane and the uneatable excreted
“Well, stone the crows!"
juices. Then, with much smacking of
lips and grinning nods of enthusiasm,
they dispatched Sir Aerial Fox to the
place of no-return in flying form.
I overcooked and ate a few, but they
dissolved like embryo squab, and even
my healthy stomach did not enjoy eating
something which suggested a cannibal who
had a weakness for embryos.
Of course the flying-fox is a fruit-eater,
and all his disgusting habits can be
burned off. These are the result of an
entirely fruit diet, and sleeping upside
down. But it was obvious the flying-fox
was not the answer to my hunger for a
changed diet.
Another chance for a change of diet
came on Vanderlin Island. As we had
not had time to build a fowlhouse, the
fowls roosted in a fairly large tree. Each
morning we discovered we had one less
fowl. It was a puzzle, because there was
never the slightest noise from the gobbled
bird. The third night we shot a 13ft. rock-
python which was about to go up into
the tree for its evening meal. Apparently
Mr. Python had the means of silent
murder. In the morning when we came
out Mr. Rock Python was well on the
way into the digestive tracts of the abos.
“Ah! New diet! ...”
A large piece of the python, which
was cooked to my order and not to that
of the natives, was handed me, and I
set about making it disappear. It was
a good, white meat, but had as much
taste in it as raw dough. If I could
have made a sauce of onions, garlic, olive-
oil, cayenne and tomatoes to pour over
it I would have had a sumptuous feed,
It was like spaghetti, just a vehicle for a
good sauce.
After that, we harpooned a dugong,
and ate dugong-meat for a day or so
until the overrich-pork taste nauseated
us.
We made johnnie-cakes of flour and
dozens of turtle-eggs, adding coconut
to make the abos extend their bellies with
what they considered a delicacy. But
for me the thought of large, juicy, tender,
rich, tasty steak (still on the hoof)
persisted.
Some months later, when I was being
driven from Burketown to Cloncurry, l
pointed away on the plain, and said to the
driver: “Look , cattle!” He looked at me
to see whether I was suffering from
beriberi, or combo-madness. “Yeah,”
he said, and went on driving, while I
looked with taste-buds dripping at “steak
on the hoof.”

BANKSIA-BIRDS
Where ocean thundered, endless, ageless,
hoarse,
beyond those trees we camped in
grotesque, coarse-
barked banksias, with black-knobbed
cobs, the birds
cried out their noisy-jack, four-o’clock,
leather-head words.
Alert, slim birds they were, sun-golden-
speckled,
chasing each other through the trees.
They heckled,
heckled us as our morning smoke
uncurled
and ocean thundered from beyond the
world.

A TAX, PLUS MOSS
T>AYROLL-TAX has never
been a hot political issue.
It hasn’t the emotional appeal
of pensions, wages and
working-hours, unemployment
or housing—which means that
it cannot be used by an Oppo-
sition to whip-up electoral sup-
port or by newspapers to boost
circulation. For both these
purposes there are several other
forms of taxation against which
it is more profitable to cam-
paign.
An agitation for a reduction
in income-tax will always
strike a responsive chord in
the public mind ; so will a
call for a cut in sales-tax.
Petrol-tax is another impost
with a direct and obvious im-
pact on the living-costs of a
large number of electors and
readers, while the excise on
beer hits an even greater
number right where they live. A
year ago, when the excise-rates
on beer were increased, speaker
after speaker on the Opposition
benches told in anguished
tones of the hardship the
higher tax would inflict on
wage-earners. No such exhibi-
tion of mass eloquence is ever
adduced in opposition to the
payroll-tax, the general
assumption seeming to be that
as this is paid by the employer
it doesn’t concern the worker.
A Gallup-poll of voters
would probably show feeling
towards it varying from mild
indifference to hearty approval
on the ground that the boss
can easily stand it.
Both views are mistaken.
Payroll-tax does concern the
wage-earner ; it is reflected in
his living-costs just as much as
sales-tax. And it falls with
equal weight on the bqss whose
profits can stand it and the one
whose losses can’t.
A few weeks ago a deputa-
tion from the Federated Tax-
payers’ Association waited upon
the Federal Treasurer—not for
first time—and urged that the
Government should give
serious thought to an early
abolition of payroli-tax.
The Treasurer told them to
submit their views in writing,
when they would receive “the
fullest consideration.” That
phrase is, of course, a stock
formula with a very elastic
meaning, but the deputation,
having nothing to lose by
taking the Treasurer at his
word, speedily complied with
his request.
The Taxpayers’ Association
had considerable support for
its contention that payroll-
tax takes more out of the con-
sumers’ pockets than it puts
into the Treasurer’s. Last
year’s report of the Common-
wealth Tariff Board had this
to say:
Payroll-tax is another example of
a Government impost, right at the
base of the eost- anti priee-
strueture, which might he con-
sidered for removal. It may he
true to say that every £1 of in-
come received by the Government
in payroll-tax means an increase
in price to consumers of at least £3.
The Tariff Board did not give
details of how it arrived at tms
figure, but the Taxpayers’ sub-
mission included “a highly
simplified example”: goods
produced by a manufacturer
are sold to a wholesaler on a
15 per cent, mark-up on cost;
by the wholesaler to a retailer
on a mark-up of 25 per cent,
and by the retailer to con-
sumer on a mark-up of 33j
per cent. The £1 paid by the
manufacturer to the Govern-
ment has inflated the cost of
the commodity by £1 18s. 4d.,
or, in other words, the cost
component has been increased
by 92 per cent.”
In some cases the increase
could be even greater —where,
for example, the manufacturer
is using raw materials or partly
processed goods whose cost to
him already included an
element of payroll-tax.
Last year the tax brought in
£4s| million. This year’s
estimate is for £4B! million, but
if the rate of collection up to
"I Wonder what'd be the best bank to open a
cheque-account with?”
the end of January is main-
tained this should be exceeded
by more than £1 million.
A considerable portion of
the tax is collected from State
Government departments and
semi - governmental authori-
ties. Premier Cahill, who
seldom has anything in com-
mon with the Taxpayers’
Association on fiscal matters,
is at one with them in pro-
testing against payroll-tax. He
has raised the question at Loan
Council meetings, and in his
last Budget speech he said that
the amount of tax payable by
N. S. Wales Government trans-
port would be £1! million and
that the total cost to his Gov-
ernment would be almost
£2,700,000:
I have made separate submission
to the Commonwealth urging that
at least organisations providing
public transport, whether Govern-
ment or privately operated, should
be exempt from this tax.
That was over six months ago.
If Mr. Cahill has received any
good news from Canberra
since, he has kept very quiet
about k.
Although accurate details of
the incidence of the tax are
not available, the Taxpayers'
Association, using what in-
formation it could glean from
the Taxation Commissioner’s
report, has prepared the
following table showing the
spread of the burden:
£m.
Government, semi-govern-
ment and local-govern-
ment authorities .. .. 13.85
Manufacturing, building
and construction .. .. 22.84
Distribution—wholesalers .. 4.44
Distribution retailers .. 3.26
Primary production and
mining 2.60
Others 2.01
£49m.
The association argues that
the tax is a substantial factor
in the operating costs of State
transport and therefore “finds
its way into higher freights and
fares with, of course, cumu-
lative effects throughout the
whole economy.” The same
thing applies to public works,
water- and power-undertakings
and local-government charges.
Of the £23 paid by
“manufacturing, building and
construction” interests the
impact of the tax would vary

with the wages-content of the
costs in each section -of
industry, but it is safe to say
that it would be particularly
high in the housing industry
because of the high wage-
component in building-costs
and the tax would also enter
into the cost of bricks, timber
and other building-materials.
Past requests for abolition of
the tax have brought the
answer that the Treasury
cannot afford the loss of
revenue. This assumes that to
wipe out the tax completely
would mean a dead loss
equivalent to the whole of the
tax this year’s estimate,
£49 million. The association
claims that this would not be
so. Payroll-tax is a direct
deduction for income-tax pur-
poses, and as it is paid only by
employers with an annual
wages bill of £6240 and over
,1 is reasonable to assume
that income-tax is or will be
reduced by Bs. in the pound of
the payroll -tax paid by
industry. .. .the loss of income-
tax may therefore be evaluated
at some £l4 million a year.”
The association further
argues that as under the present
arrangement the financial needs
of the States are inflated by
£l4 million because of the tax
“their claims on the Common-
wealth for financial assistance
could be reduced by this figure”
if the tax were abolished. This
argument is not likely to appeal
to Mr. Cahill and the other
Premiers, but it is the Federal
Treasurer the association is
trying to convince, not the
State men.
As a final point the Tax-
payers’ letter says that the
Commonwealth’s own expendi-
ture is inflated by payroll-tax
charged on Commonwealth
statutory undertakings and in
the prices it pays for corn-
modifies and services. The net
loss to the Treasury would
thus be only a fraction of the
gr OSS tax-collections of £49
million and at the same time
cos t-structure of the Aus-
traHan economy would (on the

relieved to the extent ot some-
thing like £9B million,
Those are the submissions,

sideration.”
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CARNARVON BASIN
[From L. Owen]
A LL the latest press-reports
suggest that what is still
the most promising potentially-
oil-bearing structure on the
Australian mainland is being
abandoned for areas whose
prospects cannot be considered
to be as bright.
Whether this is merely a
temporary reaction to the over-
optimism of 1953-54 —after the
subsequent failure to locate
more than traces of petroleum
—remains to be seen. It is
deplorable, however, that at
least one more deep well —
located on the accumulated
information from many dry
holes should not be sunk
before the exodus from the
Carnarvon Basin is complete,
particularly as no serious
attempt has been made to
explore pre-Triassic strata by
drilling. This statement is not
only applicable to Rough Range
and Cape Range, but covers
also Rough Range South and
Dirk Hartog Island. *
On Dirk Hartog, in fact, the
target for all wells except-
ing the final “deep-test”—
appears to have been, at
lowest, the Middle Cretaceous
unconformity, although 16
structure bores were sunk.
It is not unfair to assume,
therefore, that all that is
definitely known of the
Carnarvon Basin at depth is
the smoothed-out form of the
base of the Cretaceous system
as defined by the Birdrong sand-
stone. On Dirk Hartog, in fact,
any three-dimensional picture
—which is essential for work
of this type—would appear to
stop at the Korojon marker
b ec * of Upper Cretaceous age.
Nothing discovered in the
course of all the drilling—nor
in the bores sunk for water long
before the Carnarvon Basin was
regarded as an oil prospect —
bas encouraged the hope of the

carried its own warning.

types of apparatus by such
experienced operators as those
employed by Wapet.
This is a very serious matter
where as some of us have
contended from the early days
of oil activities in the Exmouth
Gulf area the prospects of
commercial “pools” of oil are
confined to Jurassic strata at
the very highest and more
probably occur well below the
Trias. This does not mean,
however, that discouragement
should follow the discovery of
very thick columns of unchang-
ing material underlying sur-
face structural highs. This
evidence of lack of rhythmic
conditions of deposition appears
—from an analysis of all the
surface and sub-surface data
available to me—to be local.
It has been officially
announced that the latest —but,
I trust, not the last—well to be
drilled on Rough Range (No.
10) will be located about 700 ft.
north-east from the first Wapet
well. It will be drilled down
to the Birdrong sandstone,
using a mobile T-32 rig.
Rough Range No. 3 —sited
about 3000 ft. north-north-east
of No. I—was “dry” at the
Birdrong horizon ; so was No.
6, drilled only 860 ft. to the
south-east. I have written at
length on No. 6 and I forecast
its failure long before it was
completed although, on text-
book criteria, it should have
struck oil.
What return is to be expected
from the drilling of Rough
Range No. 10 down to the
Birdrong horizon? Officially, it
is hoped to tap a fault-type
reservoir of possibly 30 to 50
acres in extent, which is not a
very glittering prize. To attain
this object will merely mean
robbing Peter to pay Paul, for
this latest well is expected to
perforate the “pool” from
which Rough Range 1a has
been fed ; the combined drain
of the pair can only hasten
encroachment by water. If, on
the other hand, the Birdrong
horizon, when reached, proves
to be barren of oil, or even of
sand, it will show that the
“pool” is even smaller than
that given in Wapet’s modest
estimate.
One aspect which puzzles me
is the locating of Rough Range
No. 10 north-east of No. 1 and
along the trace of a surface
anticlinal axis. In my con-
sidered opinion, any real exten-
sion of the Rough Range 1a
ozokeritic oil segregation is
not to be sought to the north-
east, of the “discovery” well, nor
will it be found underlying a
surface structural high.
Pinnock Finance Co., Ltd.
TNVITATIONS to the public
A to lend money at high rates
of interest, more-or-less on
faith, are becoming quite
common; one of the latest
companies to join this
high-interest-paying band of
borrowers being Pinnock
Finance Co., Ltd.
Formed to finance the dis-
tribution and retail sale of
Pinnock and Fridor sewing-
machines, Pinnock Finance is
offering from 6| p.c. (for three
months) to \2\ p.c. (eight to
ten years)-on money deposited
with the co. Short-term
deposits will be received for
periods from three to 12
months or on similar length of
notice by either party.
No prospectus has been
issued, but a brochure out-
lining the “term deposit plan”
gives details of the conditions
under which deposits will be
accepted. Apart from that
information the prospective
lender is told practically noth-
ing about the co. except the
size of its nominal and paid
capital, £500,000 and £50,000
respectively. There are no
accounts or financial reports in
the brochure and no indication
is given of the backing for the
notes or the anticipated cover
for the interest; neither the
amount sought nor the length
of time the invitation will
remain open is disclosed. The
object of the “deposit plan” is
“to provide additional funds
for the - rapidly expanding
business of the co.”
Depositors are therefore
completely in the dark regard-
ing their actual (or even
apparent) degree of security
and should judge the value of
the high rates of interest
accordingly.
The manufacturing member
of the Pinnock organisation,
Pinnock Manufacturing Pty.,
recently erected a factory at
Elizabeth (South Australia) and
hopes to be producing sewing-
machines at the rate of 2000
per month by the end of this
year with substantial increases
in the production-rate planned
for future years.

TWO LAST-NIGHTS
“Hamlet”
Not merely one, but two
early-nighters have already here
sampled the Sydney
Elizabethan Theatre’s
“Hamlet,” finding the Paul
Rogers piece of it, in particular,
pure gold.
More, they then privately
talked Paul Rogers with an
eloquence to make you think
they’d found a demijong as
veil. Heady stuff. In a word,
they said “Go /”
So, for the last-night of this
“Hamlet,” out to the address
which the pre:ent writer knew,
and was entertained in, and
suffered in, when it was the
old Majestic. And at once
an impression of local inspira-
tion, or aptness, in the renam-
ing— not on account of what
would soon be going on inside
(though that was to have its
point, too), but in this wintry
Newtown night-piece seen
from down along the 4ft. pave-
ment outside: all angled lanes
and falling walls and shadows,
and slants of light shafting
through the blue haze. Not
even a rat moving in them.
Bare . . . drab . . . sinister . . .
potential violence anything
you cared to make of it. Except
Majestic. Elizabethan is near
enough. For the present pur-
pose, a fine place for a ghost.
And for Hamlet . . .
And now, as our racecourse-
Cambyses says on the wireless,
“There’s the bell /” And
presently—in the Shakspearian,
and Yank, sense of the word—
here before us is the Ghost!
The analysts were so full of
Paul Rogers, or the demijong,
that they didn’t tell us much
about this Visitor. He’s one
hell of a hurdle, but Clement
McCallin plays him well
enough—traditionally. For the
present viewer such a long
tradition that we’d best skip
it. Just two of them: one here
at the old Majestic who
staggered a little and spoke
thick, no doubt from the dregs
and fumes of Purgatory:
another at the old Opera House
(now the Tiv.) whom the rude
multitude of boys (doing the
Leaving) applauded with a
barrage of boiled-lollies, bulls-
eyes and Queensland-nuts . . .
You move next to Queensland,
Brisbane, do you not, Clement?
Anyway, as reasonably good
as Mr. McCallin’s, or as drunk
as a Ghost may have reason to
be, always the same, traditional,
Ghost. With emphasis, a hell
of a hurdle! Apart from
directors, producers and stage-
tradition, there is also Today,
which, take it for all in all,
makes Ghosts tough going.
Even so, why can’t somebody
break through these things?
Must a wraith be stage-
sepulchral? And this particular
Ghost —has it come from the
grave, or (as Shakspeare’s
Hamlet and audience may well
have accepted) from this side
the bourn (border), from
beyond which (they might also
well have accepted) no traveller
returns (a point that might,
perhaps, settle the eternal
puzzling over that remark of
Hamlet’s)?
So, must this Ghost move
like wet clay, smell of the earth,
earthy? If you like it that way,
you’ll like Mr. McCallin’s
Ghost. But surely there must
be some other way of doing it.
The key, perhaps, could be
outside there in those
Elizabethan Newtown lanes. Or
Paul Rogers himself may have
it, tucked away in the black
doublet or under the fawn
leather jerkin which he wears as
naturally as Newtown street-
clothes.
If he hasn’t that key, he has
just about everything else. He
gives you a Hamlet who makes
you forget your whole lists of
other Hamlets. It is a shatter-
ing performance ... superb.
Flis fine voice, of course ; and
his acting—clear, compelling,
final. As well, though, there’s
the little all that most of his
supporting cast have to learn
fiom him that he has
mastered Shakspeare’s language
so that it is simply his own,
and thus is today’s. And, also,
lie doesn’t use stilts.
When you have heard a
Hamlet manage such a now-
effete archaism as (for example)
“Oh fie, fie!” . . . making it
sound fierce, solid, anguished,
completely natural and con-
vincing: something that might
be raved into the air by any
Hamlet in the lanes out there
... .Well?
A histrionic trick, maybe:
the quick-turned back: the
savagely frustrated shouted
words . . . None the less
wonderful for all that.
As briefly as words can do
for Paul Rogers: a living
Hamlet.
The King?—well, long live
Lloyd Berrell . . . but may
they please desist from dressing
him so stuffily? It is a
bulbous, funnyman’s rigout;
and to the good old bourn with
the historically approximate
when it ruins dramatic effect.
Laertes? Frederick Par-
slow doth emote too much
. . . there are surely only two
occasions on which emoting at
his high pitch is justified. The
man’s a shade tougher than
that.
And the Queen? Miss
Boxall, God bless her, her hat
fell off, and she got away with
this like a Queen ; like the
womanly Queen she is. What
she may have said to the lady-
in-waiting who helped her on
with it wasn’t, unfortunately,
audible ; but no doubt it was
womanly Queenly.
And then there is Zoe
Caldwell’s Ophelia —in the
purely personal view being
expressed here, an astonishing
delight. Miss Caldwell plays
Ophelia innocent; a hint
almost-simple ; a little—just a
little —lost. And then . . .
mad . . . wildly mad.
So many softly loving, and
then softly deranged, Ophelias!
And here one who, to begin
with, has nothing much there
to stand a strain: a breakable
thing: and, broken, a wild
madness: in her rags an
unlovely Ophelia, but a beauti-
ful one ... a thin voice saying
and singing words without
meaning, for her, or for you
. . . still, or shrill, pale ghosts
of words. A shade overswirled,
perhaps, but Very lovely.
Some applause here for Mr.
Hunt, the producer . . .
Vanbrugh
A couple of nights after the
“Hamlet,” out again for the
last night of Vanbrugh’s “The
Relapse,” and of the Sydney
season. Perhaps by now some
of the players were a little tired.
In general, it was put through
as what, in general, it maybe
is—straight farce . . . with one
or two exceptions who did make
comedy of it. Paul Rogers,
surprisingly, was hardly one of
these. It could, of course, have
been the too-recent “Hamlet” ;
as’ Foppington he was a
reminiscence of Alfred Frith-
appearance, gesture, voice, back
from the bourn, sans the
Frithian verve for farce.
Perhaps it is something to the
point that in this production
the old five-acter was put
through in three acts ; that Paul
Rogers does not appear in the
middle act at all; and that
you do not notice this till a
good five minutes after the
curtain falls. Possibly a
comment on this Foppington ;
certainly a compliment to those
of the cast who put the act
through.
In the whole performance,
two above all who do play it
as comedy: Miss Dinah Shear-
ing (as Berinthia—to the life!)
and our former friend the
Ghost, Mr. McCallin (as Love-
less) ; their performances, near
enough to equally good, make
the play. Frederick Parslow's
Younger Brother a notable
improvement on his Laertes.
And let the rest be silence. . .

Sex and Sewing-machines
“Pyjama Game,” the bright,
modern musicomedy at Sydney
Empire, is played between an
employer and the employees of
a pyjama-factory and concerns
the usual (or perhaps/nore than
usual) pairing-off of people (as
well as pyjamas)—though it is a
vain wait to see a match of any
kind for Mr. Hasler, the
employer, as he worries single-
handed about the factory.
In the circumstances he
might have had a sleeping
partner at least. This part is
played by Jack Little with just
enough hint of double-dealing
that it does not come as a
surprise that for six months he
has been paying his employees
an extra 1\ cents an hour in the
books but not in their pay-
envelopes.
Jill Perryman and Keith
Petersen provide most of the
humor as well as some comic
dancing, all of which succeeds
in being hilarious, and Don
Richards also has his moments,
especially with Dorothy Francis
when she teeters in high heels
and too-tight slacks.
William Newman manages to
seem very American and, as the
factory - superintendent, is
pleasantly assuring in his ability
to deal satisfactorily with girl-
cwra-grievance-committee in the
attractive shape of Toni
Lamond, as Babe. Together
their singing and dancing and
general kafoofling (such as
taking-off a 25-dollar dress to
make an onion-sandwich which
does not get made because of
the black-lace slip no longer
hidden by the dress) is all very
pleasantly and easily handled.
The outstanding personality,
however, is Tikky Taylor, so
straight-up-and-down that she
looks even better in a man’s
suit (and bowler-hat) than
eilher of the men with whom
she dances “Steam Heat,” the
best number in the show. Miss
Taylor nevertheless generates
plenty of sex of the particular
brand, “American.” Her walk-
ing, talking and dancing are all
crisply exaggerated, an effect
which, combined with her tini-
ness, sometimes creates the
impression of one of those per-
sonality-loaded Puppets which
were so popular in America
some time ago.
The setting of the piece is
“a small town in America’s
Middle West,” but the pattern
isn’t basically different from
the time-honored formula. The
first scene has a “chorus”
dressed in bright shoes, aprons
and smocks (factory-hands,
not milkmaids); scenes of
factory corridors and sewing-
machines are followed by some
rusticating on the village-green
(the picnic-grounds); there is
a night-club, with a stage-long
electric sign to advertise it, in
lieu- of a grand ball ; and the
“Staircase” finale makes way
for a “Pyjama Parade”—the
old familiar pattern brought
up-to-date with sex and sewing-
machines and without even a
sigh for love-among-the-daisies
lost for ever in Ruvtania.

Browning and Elizabeth Barrett
takes as its focal-point the
twisted character of the
poetess’s martinet - father,
Edward Barrett, a role played
with no little distinction by Sir
John Gielgud—stern, unbend-
ing and fanatically opposed to
the marriage of any of his
children, and deliberately
fostering the notion that his
gifted elder daughter is a hope-
less invalid, destined to spend
the rest of her days confined to
her room.
Good as is Gielgud’s per-
formance, however, it is over-
shadowed by that of Jennifer
Jones’s finely-drawn portrait of
Elizabeth. Gentle of manner
and speech, and with an easy
dignity, she brings out the
poetess’s full strength of
character with beautiful clarity.
Bill Travers is a vital and
manly Browning, and the
aggressiveness he displays in
various episodes is consistent
with that side of the poet’s
character. Virginia-McKenna
is also impressive as the scared
Flenrietta, put to all. sorts of
shifts to keep her friendship
with her military man a secret
from her irascible Pa.

“Oh Men, Oh Women!”
The gyvo and mumbo-
jumbo surrounding the fashion-
able psychoanalyst and his
works are mercilessly
lampooned in this engaging and
fast-moving comedy at Sydney
Mayfair. David Niven enjoys
a lucrative practice ministering
to the pampered neuroses of his
wealthy patients. Then on to
his consulting-room couch
droop a couple of drips, each of
whom mentions the name of the
girl whom the p.-a. is about to
marry. The practitioner him-
self is then the subject of such
a series of emotional storms
that he is at last forced to
psychoanalyse himself.
These and other situations
add-up to a lot of good clean
fun, in which Tony Randall, as
an acute sufferer from a host
of Freudian complexes, and
Ginger Rogers and Dan Dailey,
as a married pair who lean
heavily on psychiatry to ease
the burdens of their self-manu-
factured incompatibilities, add
their hilarities to Niven's
polish.

British actor Alistair Sim, of

here mixes comedy and murder
in the approved Guinness
recipe, and does it very well.
Beginning his career of homi-

explosives mixed with his head-

greater refinements of his
chosen art, always selecting
some obnoxious politician or
bumptious tycoon.
In his last and unsuccessful
attempt he is confounded by the
pertinacity of a high-pressure
vacuum - salesman (George
Cole). The plot has a fair
degree of ingenuity, speed
and humor, and Jill Adams
decorates the doings nicely as
an unwitting partner in crime-

“A King and Four Queens”
Adventurer Clark Gable
ferrets-out that there’s 100
“grand” salted away in an
isolated farmhouse, represent-
ing the loot of banditry. Farm-
house is guarded by a gun-
totin’ battleaxe (Jo Van Fleet)
who also keeps a minatory eye
on her four daughters-in-law
held prisoner there by her so
that the sole survivor of her
four bandit sons (she isn’t sure
which is the survivor) will have
his bride there when he
eventually turns up. So the
Gable gets himself shot by
Maw and cared for by the man-
hungry dames, what time he
rustles-up the loot.
The unlikely doings aren’t

COLUMN
Bums, Philp & Co., Ltd.
ALTHOUGH Burns, Philp and Co.,
Ltd., appears to have lost the bonus-
issue habit back in 1919, investors have
long been attracted to the co. by the possi-
bility of further tax-free gifts as well as
by its solid earning and dividend record.
However, shareholders who had hopes of
a capital-gain following the Coles-
Penneys merger received no encourage-
ment at the last annual meeting, at which
the chairman stressed the undeniable
advantage to shareholders of being able
to purchase shares in their co. at par.
Since 1937 (when there was a one-for-
three par-issue) the co. has made two
quite large par-issues, one-for-two in 1951
and one-for-three in 1955. Paid capital
reached £4,000,000, all in £1 ords., half-
way through last term.
Best known, perhaps, as shipowner,
merchant and island-trader and -planter,
Burns, Philp is also a large property-
owner and investor. Its shareholdings
include substantial interests in Queens-
land Insurance Co., Ltd., Bankers and
Traders Insurance Co., Ltd., and, since
last July, something like a 13 p.c. holding
in G. J. Coles and Co., Ltd. Chief sub-
sidiaries are Burns Philp (South Sea), Ltd.,
and its New Hebrides offshoot; Burns
Philp (New Guinea), Ltd. (traders and
plantation-owners); Burns Philp Co. of
San Francisco (buying and selling-agents)
and Burns Philp Trust Co., Ltd. In
addition the parent controls a number of
suburban and country retail stores.
Early last term the retailing subsidiary,
Penneys, Ltd., and its chain of 48 stores
were sold to G. J. Coles and Co. for
3,600,000 ss. shares in that co. and
£1,025,000 in cash —cash-payments to be
spread over eight years.
Now in its 75th year, the co. finds
its shipping interests a lot less profitable
than they were earlier in the century and,
since the 1939-45 war, greater emphasis
has been placed on merchandising, par-
ticularly retailing. According to the chair-
man “wholesale merchandise business is
gradually fading-out,” front-rank retailers
dealing direct with manufacturers. The
decision to sell Penneys, therefore, was
something of a surprise, but one of the
reasons given for the sale was the cost
of developing the co. (expanding into
Victoria and South Australia) if a higher
and more economical level of sales was
to be obtained.
Consolidated accounts are not pub-
lished, despite the fact that most of the
earnings come from subsidiary cos. and
investments, while trading and investment
profits are lumped together irt the parent’s
accounts with “income from all sources.”
The provision made for taxation is not
revealed.
During the year to March 31 last the
“most prosperous interests” were the
copra plantations, of which there are
about 40, mostly in New Guinea. Once
again there was little profit in the shipping
side of the business although, of course,
other activities benefited from the ship-
ping services. The tighter financial condi-
tions were being felt towards the end of
the year, but merchandising, through
branch and country stores, gave “satisfac-
tory” results though margins were finer,
costs increasing with turnover. Burns Philp
(South Sea) increased its earnings from
£126,850 to £136,509 (Fijian) and both
the American and New Guinea sub-
sidiaries improved their positions, the
parent’s gross profit and “income from all
sources” improving by £74,465 to
£2,508,771.
Including the profits of subsidiaries
only to the extent of dividends received
and after allowing a generous £342,352
(down £49,432) for depreciation, £250,000
for tonnage replacement (unaltered) and
£50,000, again unchanged, for property
replacement, the parent co. claimed a net
profit of £563,105 for the year, £63,812
better than in the preceding term:

The div.-rate was maintained at 10
p.c., but an extra £50,202 was required to
service the larger capital, £500,000 coming
in during the year following the previous
term’s one-for-three issue. The £563,105
profit, from which £27,082 was allocated
to the staff-fund, represented a return of
15.1 p.c. on the average share-capital
employed compared with 15.4, 15.9, 13.1,
13.1 and 17.2 p.c. back to 1952. On'
average shareholders’ funds the profit
was a moderate 5.2 p.c. The net addition
to reserves, including provisions for
replacement, etc., amounted to £464,103.
Since 1952 £2,038,444 has been pro-
vided against depreciation of fixed assets
which, with investments, are shown in the
balance-sheet on a conservative cost, or
cost less depreciation, basis:

The £500,000 of fresh capital received
helped to finance the extra £617,279
shown against investments, both
Queensland Insurance and Bankers
and Traders making cash-issues
during the year, while the invest-
ment in Penneys was replaced by the in-
terest in G. J. Coles and Co. A further
1,080,000 bonus-shares and 1,404,000 new


shares .at par in Coles will be available
under the share-issue plans announced
earlier this year. A new motor-vessel,
Montoro, of about 3200 tons (d.w.),
was delivered to the co. during the year.
This was largely responsible for the
£362,013 increase in fixed assets (total cost
of the vessel was roughly £800,000) and
also, through transfers from current to
fixed assets, brought about most of the
£433,459 drop in stocks, etc.
The agreement with the U.K. Govern-
ment, guaranteeing copra prices, expires
at the end of 1957. Prices under this
agreement have been above those avail-
able on the open market and, to stabilise
the position, an orderly marketing system
(in which B.P. would probably play a
large part) has been suggested by the
co.
Although paid capital has been doubled
in the last six years, the reinvestment of
a large share of the earnings has been
necessary to finance new tonnage and
expansion generally and, as a new 8000-
tonner may be ordered by the board early
next year, costing approximately
£1,500,000, the provision of large sums
for tonnage replacement, etc., is likely to
continue for some time.
The parent co.’s accounts give insuffi-
cient information to enable an accurate
assessment of the true earning-power and
asset-backing of the scrip, but the share-
market, by pricing the f.-p. £1 ords. at
60s. 3d., to return 3.3 p.c. from
a 10 p.c. div., values the undertaking at
£12,050,000. Net tangible cover (book-
value, parent’s accounts only) is 565. 9d.
Kelvinator Australia, Ltd.
FEWER domestic refrigerators were
produced in Australia last year but
trading conditions remained highly com-
petitive and more than one manufacturer
found the going very difficult. In these
circumstances Kelvinator Australia, Ltd.,
a successful South Australian manufac-
turer, did reasonably well to return its
second-highest profit on record ; the co.’s
earnings were, however, 17.7 p.c. below
those of the previous year.
Formed nearly 25 years ago Kelvin-
ator turns out domestic and commercial
refrigerators, electric petrol-pumps, win-
dow air-conditioners and other electrical
and domestic appliances. Following the
introduction of Kelvinator radios in the
preceding term a range of television-
receivers was released towards the end
of last year.
A one-for-two issue late in 1955
lifted ord. capital to £1,012,500, £20,000
in 6 p.c. prefs. participating to 74 p.c.,
the same amount in fixed 6 p.c. prefs. and
£190,000 in 5 p.c. prefs., taking the total
on the share register to £1,242,500. Over
the last 10 years ord. divs. have averaged
14 p.c.
Production of domestic refrigerators
last year (to December 31) dropped by
41,000 to 211,500 but the co. appears, at
least, to have maintained its share of the
market. After providing £186,024 for
taxation and £147,870 for depreciation
(neither provision was disclosed in the
previous term) net profit for the year
ended March 31 last fell by £51,902 to
£241,235:

The ord. capital raised in the ’56 term
participated fully in divs. for the first time
but the 15 p.c. div.-rate was maintained
without any trouble, earnings covering
the pref. divs. and 22.6 p.c. on ord.
capital compared with 27.7, 33.4, 33 and
25.8 p.c. back to 1953. A capital profit
from the sale of land added £13,621 to
reserves.
A modern and well-equipped plant has
helped the co. to keep costs in check,
improvements and expansion, which last
term cost approximately £446,000, more
than doubling the book-value of plant
and equipment in four years. Deprecia-
tion, etc., left the net addition to fixed
assets (mainly plant) for the term at
£326,750, freeholds (up £75,155) being
shown at 1951 valuation and subsequent
cost less depreciation. Share-capital is
well supported by reserves, which include
£286,250 from revaluation and premiums
and total £1,222,462, only £20,038 less
than paid capital:

After a big drop in the preceding term,
stocks rose rather sharply, increasing by
£379,629 (or 28.1 p.c.), while creditors,
etc., were down by £222,733 and debtors
£182,421 lower at £254,434. To assist in
financing the heavy capital-expenditure
and larger stocks, the co. drew on its cash
holdings (down £458,228) and increased
the long-term mortgage by £192,500.
There was a small drop in liquidity over
the year and working-capital was £46,725
lower at £1,614,764.
The co. is well equipped to meet the
strong competition expected in the current
term and recently released a new range
of household refrigerators with which it
hopes to secure an even larger share of
the market. While the demand for
refrigerators seems to have levelled out,
sales of television-receivers have picked
up considerably in'the past few months
and may make a larger (although still
small) contribution to income in the
current term. Kelvinator doesn’t, at
present, manufacture its own radio and
TV-receivers.
The f.-p. ss. ords. in the co. last sold
at 9s. 4d. to yield 8 p.c. from a 15 p.c.
div. The prefs., rarely seen on the market,
participate in any surplus on return of
capital, each £1 of paid capital having
the support of tangible assets valued at

Anthony Hordern and Sons, Ltd.
■pOR retailers located in Sydney’s
quieter parts the retreat of shoppers
to the. suburbs has become a matter of
real concern. A product of the high cost
of travelling and the city’s lack of
parking-space, the problem has been
made the more pressing by the heavy
increases recently in a number of over-
head expenses, which have to be met
regardless of the volume of business
being done.
The increased activity in the faubourgs
was counted as a major factor by Anthony
Hordern’s in the drop in its sales last
year. Since July, 1956, the co. has had
a branch-store in Canberra’s Civic
Centre, but most of its trade (it handles
everything from food to hardware,
furnishings and furniture and clothing) is
carried on in the big emporium at the
corner of George-, Goulburn- and Pitt-
streets in uptown Sydney.
To improve shopping facilities the store
was extensively remodelled a few years
back, and this, together with other helpful
factors, sent earnings shooting ahead.
Last term there was an unstated fall in
turnover, the new N.S.W. land-tax cost
£43,000, and, though the store carried
fewer on the payroll, wages were £64,500
higher. Employees work under a State
award, which is subject to cost-of-living
adjustments and to a special loading for
Saturday-morning work. As well, an
examination of stocks disclosed slow-
moving lines which could only be
cleared at a discount. So, after providing
an extra £1452 (£56,452) depreciation and
£67,250 less (£85,750) for co.-tax, there
was a drop in net earnings from the
previous term of just on 56 p.c., to
£102,686:

preceding three years (Hordern’s brightest
period as a public concern), and 6.2
p.c., 6.3 p.c. and 6.5 p.c. in the triennium
before that. Notwithstanding, it was
decided to leave the ord. div. at 10 p.c.
To meet the situation the management
has instituted budgetary-accounting, on
the lines of its competitors, and a new
system of merchandise-control.
Buying and selling is now in the hands
of four divisional managers, and arrange-
ments have been made for stock to be

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY
The immediate objective is to undertake, under contract, the
development of approximately 10,000 acres of unimproved country
located in the .Central Tablelands which will be acquired by five
Rural Development Groups, the establishment of which Groups
is being- sponsored by the Company. Under these contracts the
Company will provide all services necessary for laud development,
pasture improvement and management required to bring the
properties into full production. In addition to providing modern
techniques and equipment not normally available to smaller scale
operations the Company will engage in grazing and other pastoral
activities on the land under development as provided for in its
contracts with the Rural Development Groups. It will also
operate a small demonstration farm which it is proposed to
acquire when a suitable opportunity occurs.
Applications from the public are invited but may only be

Encouraged by its success in
Canberra (where results are

Tighter control over stocks
was reflected in a drop of

Kornblums Furnishings
TMPORT-restrictions caused
Kornblums Furnishings,
Ltd., to handle a much larger
proportion of locally produced
goods last term, but while these
restrictions forced the co. to
find new sources of supply and
generally added to trading
difficulties, they also helped to
boost the earnings of its manu-
facturing subsidiary to a record
level.
An importer, manufacturer
and distributor of furnishings,
Kornblums has its head-office
in Melbourne’s Flinders-lane.
Two of the three operating
subsidiaries distribute carpets,
linoleum, furnishing-materials,
etc., throughout Australia ;
the third offshoot, Furnishing
Textiles Pty., manufactures
high - grade furnishing-fabrics.
> The parent co. was formed
in 1951 (over 60 years after the
foundation of the business),
180,000 10s. ords. being offered
to the public at par. In 1953,
to assist in financing the pur-
chase of a South Australian
subsidiary, 40,000 £1 6 p.c.
prefs., participating to 7 p.c.,
were issued, taking paid capital
to £310,000.
The year ended January 31
last was a difficult one for the
distributing cos.; imports were
cut to a minimum and demand
for furnishings was weaker.
The board, however, claims
that sales “generally were well
maintained except in the case
of some basic lines of floor-
coverings.” On the other hand,
the shortage of imported
goods stimulated the manufac-
turing co.’s turnover, resulting
in a record, but undisclosed,
profit. A modest export-trade
with New Zealand was main-
tained.
Overall, group earnings
dropped by £7493 to £58,159,
after providing £41,997 (down
£6503) for taxation and £12,195

Future
m
What changes will the next fifty years bring to
Australia? What will the economic and social
developments be, where will the industrial accents
lie?
To get a picture of the changes fifty years
can bring, let us look back into 1907. Australia
then had a population of about 4,250,000 —
approximately half our numbers today.
Federation was still in its infant years. The
systems that order our present way of life were
just beginning to form.
Gold, the spur of colonial settlement, was king
in the realm of mineral recovery. The ten years
in which 1907 were set, were to see the production
of 33,432,000 fine ounces of Australian gold—by
far the highest yield in any ten years in our
history.
Uranium was meaningless and unsought. The
rutile in beach sands was left to the washing of
the tides because the jet aircraft for which its
titanium would be needed were then fantastically
in the future.
Time was only four years on from the first
powered flight by man, and aviation was a field
which only the most adventuresome were starting
to invade.
Automobiles were an expensive hobby for the
few.
Sciences of the soil were still somewhat of a
mystery. Rural organisation was less than a theory.
Earth-moving and farm equipment as we know it
now was not even in a designer’s mind.
These are only a few of the limitless compari-
sons that can be drawn to mark the change in
every department of our national life.
Here is the point of it all: New power, new
knowledge, are bringing their impetus, and the next
half century will, I believe, see a transformation
more remarkable than that which the years since
1907 have produced until now.
And the pace of Australia’s progress is going
to be determined by the Faith and Courage with
which we set ourselves to make the most of these
quickening years.

Silver Valley Uranium Mine
TTNABLE to reconcile the
views of contrib.-share-
holders- with those held by the
vendor (f.-p.) shareholders, the
board of Silver Valley Uranium
Mine, N.L., has given up its
attempt to produce a scheme
of capital-reorganisation. Pro-
posals submitted to members
last March were withdrawn
after adverse comments from
holders of contrib.-shares, and,
despite subsequent negotia-
tions, the board was unable to
make any recommendation at
the annual meeting earlier this
month. It was intended that
the uncalled liability on the
contrib.-shares would be re-
moved in any capital-reorgani-
sation.
Formed in 1954 to prospect
for uranium, the co. paid
£lO,OOO in cash and £lOO,OOO
in f.-p. ss. shares for lease-
applications, etc., relating to
areas in the Inverell (N.S.W.)
district. The public put up
£120,000, taking 1,600,000 ss.
shares paid to Is. 6d. The
uranium located, however, was
low-grade stuff, and in 1955 the
co. abandoned its uranium-
prospecting areas and exercised
an option over approximately
385 acres of land at Jerusalem
Creek, south of Evans Head
(N.S.W.). After some delay
rutile production commenced
late in April, ’57. Four-weekly
production reports will be
issued, the first at the end of
this month. The co. claims to
have “firm orders at approxi-
mately £lOO per ton” (well
above current prices) sufficient
to cover production “for the
remainder of 1957.”
Royalties are to fluctuate
with earnings and are to be
“calculated on the basis of 10
p.c. of the net trading profit
earned by the co. as a result
of operations in the area.” In
addition the vendor may take
up 250,000 contribs. for cash,
in parcels of .10,000 or more,
within the two years following
commencement of rutile-
mining operations.
Silver Valley’s accounts for
the year to June 30, ’56, were
published almost 11 months
after the close of the term and
showed, rather belatedly, that
after writing-off £124,896 of
leases and prospecting expendi-
ture the p. and 1. debit increased
by £125,774 to £150,509. In-
terest on loans —the accounts
don’t indicate to whom —
brought in £1968. At balance-
date current assets, mainly cash
and advances, exceeded liabili-
ties by £55,326, but the position
has altered considerably over
the past year and, according to
the chairman, funds have been
depleted. Income from the sale
of rutile is expected to restore
a reasonable level of liquidity
by the end of next month.
The ss. contribs. paid to
Is. 6d. account for £120,000
of the £220,000 paid capital and
recently sold at Is.
Western Titanium, N.L.
T>Y exercising options held
over mining-claims and

the Bunbury-Busselton railway-

reserves from an estimated
4,300,000 tons to over
11,000,000 tons. The ilmenite
content of the heavy mineral
in the newly-acquired deposit
is given as 82.8 p.c., with the
zircon, monazite and rutile
content totalling about 12 p.c.
The purchase-price of the
new area, approximately 892
acres, was £lOO,OOO, of which
£50,000 will be in scrip and
the balance in cash. The cash
will be paid in instalments, the
last of which is due in
December, ’59, while the scrip

to June 30, ’59.
Last month’s statement by
the chairman (J. C. Westhoven)
that the mine “will soon reach
a stage of profit-earning which
will permit of regular
dividends” has strengthened
sharemarket interest and the
f.-p. ss. shares are currently
selling at 9s. lid., as against
a brief “low” of 6s. Bd. last
April. Production of ilmenite
for the four-weekly period to
May 22 last was 4900 tons.

From Herbert Holman
T ONDON Transport Com-
mission’s watchword
seems to be “Mind the pennies
and the millions will take care
of themselves” ; it has applied
for authority for a further re-
vision in fares —the tenth since
1947 and the sixth since 1953.
This will mean that the pre-war
scale of Id., 2d. and 3d. will
become 3d., sd. and 6d. But
that is not all. In September
last year, when price-increases
were unpopular, the commis-
sion found an ingenious method
of producing more revenue
without adding to the price of
the tickets.
This was the removal of
“sub-standard” fares, on the
plausible ground that it was
unfair for those passengers on
the shorter stages to subsidise
those on the longer stages. So,
in a grand levelling-up process,
the routes were restaged on
a strictly arithmetical basis,
with the result, highly lucrative
to the commission, that it is
nothing unusual for a fare-
stage to be set two stops before
a natural destination.
The days are long past, of
course, when the customer felt
that the service ran for his
benefit. Not only does he have
to pay heavily for his short
journeys, but he soon knows
when wage-inflation or other
grievances upset the crews.
Lacking other means of self-
expression, they take it out on
him, overrunning the stops,
starting with jerks or creeping
sullenly in convoys of five or
more at 20-minute intervals.
The commission’s command
of phrase is so felicitous as to
merit a page in Modem Eng-
lish Usage under such a head-
ing as “ambiguous benefice,
officially inspired.” Thus:
headroom, a bureaucratic
euphemism for excessive profit-
margin ; temporary (as with
“Suez halfpenny”), discounted
permanence ; experimental (as
with a mile-and-a-half stage at
4d.), a blow-softener preceding
the 4d. mile ; unfair distinction\
i.e., that of early-morning
travellers enjoying reduced
fares over the rest: levelling-
up by soft words.
There are some 40 objectors,
mostly public authorities,
headed by the L.C.C., but it is
not to be expected that they
will make much headway
(man-in-the-street for frustra-
tion by monopoly). The in-
creases (mainly the consolida-
tion of the “Suez halfpenny”
and a penny on the present
fourpenny fare) will bring in a
further £4,500,000 in a full
year. And that temporary-
permanent halfpenny fetched
£700,000 in five months.
Pennywise finance is certainly
big business. It can only be a
matter of months before some-
one points out that the pas-
senger who pays 6d. for a three-
mile journey has an “unfair
advantage” over the one who
travels a mile for 3d.
Little Man on ’Change
With inflation cutting into
his loose silver in this fashion
it is not surprising that the little
man, too, should wish to pro-
tect his modest savings from
depreciation. Unit trusts are
becoming better-known and are
expanding steadily. It is not
unusual nowadays for trea-
surers of church building-
funds, savings groups and the
like to deposit some of their
money with these concerns.
The pioneer of unit trusts,
the Municipal and General
Securities Company, now 25
years old, has recently circu-
lated an impressive array of
graphs in demonstration of its
record. Two are of especial
interest. The first shows the
actual gross income and the
same, adjusted for the pur-
chasing-power of the £, on £lOO
invested in 1931. These are
the figures at the end of
1956:

Savoy Hotel

good ordin-
ary share) 16 9 0 6 1 0
Their own
units .. .. 14 2 0 5 6 0
A conclusion of much in-
terest to investors is reached in
the other graph, a theoretical
exemplification of three unit-
holders, each investing the
same sum regularly every two
months and having started at
different times —1931 (at
31s. 9d.), 1936 (at 525. 6d.),
and 1940 (at 255. 6d.). By
1956 it is shown that the aver-
age costs of all three were very
near to each other and that the
1931 and 1936 investors had
actually bought cheaper, on
average, than the third. A
startling premise, which sug-
gests that the regular investor
who comes in “at the top”
benefits more than the man
who gets in near the bottom
of the cycle. Is there a fallacy
(comparable figures are not
given over a short term) or
does the graph simply establish
that investment in ordinary
shares over a long period is a
guarantee of capital appre-
ciation?
By their constitution, the
managers of these unit trusts
act as investing agents. They
hold no investment-reserve
fund, as do the investment
trusts. But they claim that
their widespread and carefully
selected portfolio is able to
withstand market ups-and-
downs. During the period
30/12/’49 —2B /12 / ’56 they
report a rise in asset-value of
67 per cent., which is about the
same as the “Financial Times”
industrial index (30 securities)
and a third as good again as
the Actuaries’ Index (about 150
securities).
Setback for the Wells
The news .that the directors
of Sadler’s Wells are forced
to capitulate to rising costs
and hand over the Theatre
Ballet to Covent Garden is
sad but inevitable. This means
that, for the first time since
Lilian Baylis reopened it in
1931, the theatre will cease to
have its own regular ballet.
As a result, the vast artistic
gap that stretches between the
school of ballet and the inter-
national scale of production at
Covent Garden will be left
wide open. Since its modest-
enough formation in 1946, the
Theatre Ballet has proved a
worthy, if sometimes self-
consciously poor - relation,
intermediary and, because of
the prohibitive cost of touring
the bigger productions, has
also taken the ballet to the
provinces.
Although the forced
economy leaves the Wells free
to devote itself wholly to opera,
there is little consolation for
opera-lovers, for finance won’t
admit of more than one new
production a year —an an-
nouncement that is all the more
depressing because it coincides
with the successful premiere of
“The Moon and Sixpence.”
This opera (by John Gard-
ner to Patrick Terry’s adapta-
tion of the Somerset Maugham
novel) is, on all counts, a
meritorious event. Not exactly
world-beating, but proving the
worth of just such an organi-
sation as the Wells, working
for art’s sake rather than for
the box-office and commission-
ing young creative artists from
the contemporary scene. After
all, a similar kind of thing
happened some 160 years ago
in a suburb of Vienna.
There the comparison ends.
Butcher-boys will not be
whistling Gardner’s tunes and
his theatre-sense is never as
sure as Mozart’s. The score
suggests background music to
a film, is exciting and very
moving but esoteric, noisy and
overstylised; it sounds arbi-
trary, lacking cohesion with
the text. Even so, to the more
sophisticated, there is much to
commend: the sung dialogue,
for example, sounds natural;
the score brings-out the
emotional conflicts; and, if
there are too many climaxes,
some of them at odds with the
action* the overall impression
is compelling. The plot is
episodic and easy to follow,
but without dramatic tension.
Peter Hall’s first essay in
operatic production is trium-
phant, both in simple effect
and in disproving the accepted
notion that singers cannot act.
Leslie Hurry’s sets are most
appealing, for their ingenuity
and for their Gauguin-like
exoticism. The singers, who
include John Hargreaves (a
wilful, utterly selfish Strick-
land), Rowland Jones (a
pathetically weak- willed
Stroeve), Elizabeth Fretwell (a
human, anxious Blanche),
Owen Brannigan (a sympa-
thetic Dr. Coutras) and Edith
Coates (a blase, flamboyant
Tiare) rise nobly to demands
which are both exacting and
un-Italian.


Freedom is a Rainlow
HUNGARY’S freedom -
fight interrupted its
participants in many
unwarlike activities and
frames of mind. Gyula Lovas
was working in the garden of
the villa where he lived with
his wife and Tamas, his nine-
year-old son, when the phone
rang.
He tried to reject the out-
side world ; he went on work-
ing on the vegetable-patch. It
provided a little more food for
the family. It had been a
flower-bed before the war, he
reflected bitterly. He stopped
digging, straightened himself,
and wondered: Why should I
remember the flower-bed, just
because the phone rang?
The phone kept ringing.
He wished that Paula might
pick up the receiver and tell the
caller that her husband was
away on a long walk in the
mountains.
On this, his annual holiday
(a fortnight), Lovas tried to
create a vacuum around him-
self. He refused to read the
papers; he listened only to
music on the radio. Ever since
the Communists had established
themselves in Hungary these
two weeks of solitude every
year gave him strength to carry
on.
Compared with others, he
was fortunate. The villa on
Rose Hill, overlooking Buda-
pest, was occupied by members
of the Lovas family only. In
the two rooms upstairs lived
his sister and Albert, her
husband. In the four rooms
divided into two flats down-
stairs lived his father and his
own family. A privileged
position: Lovas was in the
employ of the Communist
Government, in a high position
in the Ministry of Agriculture’s
planning-section.
He was marked “unreliable,”
but tolerated. He had special
knowledge. He uttered no
opinions, obeyed orders, and
worked as well as his masters
allowed him. The comfortable
flat, with one of Budapest’s
finest views, made him a
compromiser.
The Communists gave their
reluctant experts a little more
than they gave the indifferent
or hostile people—a feeling
that there was still something
to lose. In Lovas’s case it was
the flat, in a pleasant district,
its inhabitants mostly Russian
families, party - members in
high positions, and Avos,

revolt of October-
November last year, is a

members of the dreaded and
despised Red secret-police.
Already dusk mingled with
mist in the October evening.
A fresh breeze' rose. Lovas
went inside. The phone still
rang. Paula was nowhere.
Slowly the mechanical
urgency of the call defeated
Lovas. Hesitantly he lifted the
receiver.
“Listen,” he heard a
trembling, excited voice,
alternately whispering and
shouting. “Go at once to the
city and collect the family
before it’s too late.”
■pOR a moment Lovas was
mystified. Who was talk-
ing to him? What was the
significance of his message?
Then he realised it was Albert,
his brother -in - law, an
announcer at Radio Budapest.
The cultured, smooth voice,
trained to be so calm and
reassuring, was broken by fear
and emotion. Hardly intelli-
gible, it went on: “The radio-
building is surrounded by
armed men. I’ll need a great
deal of luck to break out of
here. Get my wife and daughter
out of the city. You know
where to find them. Rose Hill
will be safe for the time being.”
A loud click. The receiver
had been violently replaced.
Lovas looked at his watch.
It was six in the afternoon.
Maria, his sister, was due to
leave her office in half-an-hour
to collect her daughter, Judit,
from the day-home. He had
to act fast.
He heard the familiar steps-
of his wife and son. Hurriedly
he put on his overcoat, took
the little money there was in
the family till, and as Paula
and Tamas came in, he was
ready to leave.
“You’re going .out?” Paula
asked.
“Yes. There’s some sort of
a demonstration in the city, on
the Pest side. Albert rang me.
He’s trapped in the studio. I
must go and get Maria and
Judit home.”
Paula looked at her husband
incredulously.
“It must be a joke,” she said.
“Violent demonstration? But
that’s impossible.”
A burning shame over-
whelmed Lovas. He thought
as Paula did. Defy the Govern-
ment —openly? He looked
around the small, comfortable
flat. . .
“I must go.”
He hurried out into the cold
air. The narrow, cobbled
street was deserted. The self-
made solitude of his holiday
was not broken yet. He looked
down on the twinkling lights
of Pest on the other side of the
Danube. They told him
nothing.
TJE ran towards the main
road and managed to hail
a taxi.
“Where to?” the driver
asked.
“Balzac-street will be good
enough,” Lovas said.
“If it’s good enough for
you, it’s good enough for me,”
the cabman said, and drove
fast towards the city.
They travelled in silence. A
taxi-plate was a privilege,
obtained mostly by party-
members. The chances were
that the cab-driver was a
member or informer of the
Avos.
The driver broke the silence.
“You’re going to the wrong
place if you want to join the
demonstrators.”
“I don’t know anything
about the demonstration.”
The driver shrugged as he
took a sharp turn. The wheels
screeched.
“Just as you like.”
“You tell me about it,”
Lovas said.
“You can find it out for
yourself. I’m not an informa-
tion-bureau.”
Mutual distrust spread an
uneasy silence.
“I've been on holidays; I
don’t know a thing. I’m just
going to pick up my sister and
her daughter.” Lovas tried to
ease the tension.
The driver remained resent-
ful. “That’s your business,” he
said.
The cab sped over Chain
Bridge, and now, on the
Pest side of the twin-city, it
had to slow down. After the
lonely streets of Buda, the sight
overwhelmed Lovas.
The streets were fully lit-up,
and masses of people moved
on the pavements and roads.
Traffic was almost at a stand-
still.
Red-white-and-green flags
fluttered in the wind, the
national colors of Hungary.
The Soviet emblem that
replaced the old Magyar crest
after the war was cut from
the centre of the flags. The
crowd sang songs, some of
which had not been heard
since the Reds came to
power; Kossuth songs, the

“Marseillaise,” with the “Inter-
nationale.”
The cab forged slowly
through the crowd. Lovas
watched men, women and
children embracing, shaking
hands, talking, bursting into
song and cheers. He had a
weird impression that all these
people had come out in the
streets to meet each other, and
for the first time for years had
ceased to be strangers.
Ti .
It was rather pointless to
keep the taxi; the fare would
probably be half Lovas's
monthly pay. But he decided
to retain it. Once, he thought,
we are on the Buda side it
would be too far for Maria
and Judit to walk home.
“Still want to go to Balzac-
street?” the driver asked,
“Would you rather get out
here, and walk to the radio-
station?”
“I told you before, I must
take my sister and niece home.
Why don’t you believe me ?’’
“Maybe I will when I see
them.”

It was well past eight.

J im >. cabma ? drove t0 T
lonely figures. Judlt
shivered in her thin overcoat,
“Here, take a swig of this.’
The cabman handed his rum-
flask to the back-seat. “It
should warm you up, little
girl-”
Judit, who always feared
strangers, accepted with a
smile. She gulped a little, and
the strong stuff made her
cough.
“I have a girl just like yours,
lady,” the cabman said, driving
through a side-street, avoiding
the crowds.
“Albert told me about the
trouble at the radio-station,”
Maria said. “He said to pick
up Judit, and then wait for
you. So I left the office”
“You left the office during
working-hours?” Lovas asked,
amazed.
“I did. And all the others.”
Lovas felt like a Rip van
Winkle. In one day, this
incredible transformation. In
the past anyone who left his
place of work without permis-
sion had been dismissed with
hardly any prospect of another
job. Now Maria and her whole
office had just got up and
walked out . . .
But as they passed through
the lonely streets of Buda the
huge crowds carrying flags with
the “shame cut out of them”
seemed merely a perplexing
wish - dream, inspiring and
frightening him.
Maria fought her tears.
“What will happen to
Albert? They’ll kill him if he
can’t get out of the studio,” she
whispered.
“Who are they?’’ Lovas
asked.
“It could be anyone,” Maria
said. “The Avos, the students
who lead the demonstra-
tion” —
When thousands had died in
the streets of Budapest, every
time Lovas saw a mutilated
corpse, alive perhaps a few
minutes before, he remembered
Maria’s anxiety over a single
life.
Lovas paid the cabman, a


street away from their home.
He mistrusted him despite his
kindness and didn’t want him
to know where he lived.
“Trust no one, fear every-
body,” was the code, and
Lovas had learned his lesson
well. Most of his relatives had
spent time in jails. They had
come out meeic and pliable.
They seldom spoke of the
treatment that made them
different.
BUT Albert had managed to
escape. He was waiting in
Lovas’s flat. The two rooms
were full of relatives. Albert
was the centre of attention.
“I stood face-to-face with
ten students who forced their
way into the studio. They
insisted that their demands for
freedom and better living-
conditions be read over the air
instantly.
“The Communists stalled for
time. The crowd blocked the
gate. No secret - police re-
inforcements could come in.
But the students didn t know
about the entrance in the back
of the building, through the
garage. Four-hundred Avos,
with machine-guns and hand-
grenades, sneaked in there.
“The Avos disarmed the
sixty conscripts on duty, and
took over the whole building.
By now,” Albert made a tired
gesture with his hands, “it may
be all over. The students will
b e arrested, the crowd
dispersed.”
It was ten-o’clock, but no
one thought of going to bed.
“The Avos might arrest the
students, but there are not
enough police to disperse all
the people I saw in the city,”
Lovas said.
“You’re right,” old Lovas
agreed. “These are great events,
not the simple silent
demonstration they contem-
plated in sympathy with the
Poles. The Poles had enough
courage to rise against the
Russians and their local hire-
lings. Now we are doing the
same.”
“The Communists,” Albert
said, “could never agree to
some of the students’ demands.
Liquidate the Avos ? Well,
maybe, that could be done. Or
replace them with something
more human. But insisting that
the Russians leave Hungary by
the end of the year! Surely
that is outside possibility!”
And so the Lovas family
went on arguing, hoping, warn-
ing each other against careless
talk, and against optimism.
“Maybe we can hear some
news on the radio,” Albert
said.
The loudspeaker blared in-
different music.
“Try Free Europe,” Paula
suggested.
“You can try what you like,”
old Lovas interrupted; “I’m
going out. I want to see for
myself . . .”
They all decided to go,
leaving Paula and the two chil-
dren behind. The siege of
Budapest during World War
II had left Paula bomb-happy.
Crowds frightened her.
was the sense in a
family seeking refuge
and then venturing out to the
very danger-spots they. had
tried to avoid ? Apparently the
urge to witness this show of
national defiance and become
at least onlookers was greater
than their desire for personal
safety.
Rose Hill is miles from Pest,
and they had to walk the full
distance. By now transport
had ceased altogether. As they
trudged over the Margaret
Bridge, Hungarian armored
cars rumbled past them. In the
semi-darkness they saw the
national flags on the cars, still
bearing the Soviet emblem.
“We shall finish up killing
each other. Once more
Hungarians will slaughter their
own kith and kin,” Albert
remarked glumly.
No one answered him. Under
tne Communist regime any
demonstration ended in a
blood-bath. The Avos men
would act with ruthless effici-
ency. And after? The same
soul-killing existence, the
shackles tightened a little
more.
Yet more and more people
thronged in the streets and the
squares. The mutilated flags
still showed defiance.
As the Lovas family
approached Bajcsi Zsilinszky-
road a number of trucks
packed with young * workers
passed them by.
“The workers are coming!”
the youths on the trucks
shouted jubilantly.
And the workers came from
the great factory-centres; they
came from Angel Field, and
from Csepel as soon as their
afternoon shift was over. They
finished at ten, but instead of
dispersing to their homes they
converged on the city.
The demonstration, which
had appeared in the afternoon
to be an affair of intellectuals
and students, took a much
broader aspect. The very core
of the “People’s Republic” was
rising against its supposed
mentors.
The crowd was heatedly
discussing Erno Gero’s broad-
cast.
“Gero called me a Fascist, a
counter - revolutionary,” a
young worker in a leather coat
boomed to a small gathering.
“Ever since I was a kid I’ve
worked with these two hands.
My old man was killed by the
Nazis, because he had enough
guts to stand up against them.
The Arrow Cross boys beat me
up when I refused to join their
movement. Now 1 am a
Fascist. Gero is going to teach
us a lesson for wanting decent
wages, a little freedom and to
see the last of the Russkis. I’m
a Hungarian who wants a
decent meal and some decent
clothing for a decent day’s
work. I guess that’s what
makes me a tool in the hands of
the bourgeois democracies! I
am a tool of the American
capitalists, their paid agent!
Now let me tell you something :
1 haven’t seen an American in
my whole life! ”
The chatter of the milling
crowds filled the cold air. In
the whole history of the city
there were never more people
in the streets, never was a more
united protest against a puppet
regime.
Yet Erno Gero, secretary of
the Hungarian Communist
Party, the biggest power in the
country, still thought himself
strong enough to liquidate the
demonstration and its leaders.
The point was, though, that
there were no leaders. Most
of the demonstrators found
themselves on the streets
against their better judgment,
driven by an impulse they were
unable to resist.
At this moment it was the
students who were formulating
the freedom-demands. They
asked nobody to follow them ;
they had no intention of using
force —an armed uprising did
not occur to them at all. Most
of them were members of
various Communist youth-
organisations.
The centre of the demonstra-
tion was the Radio Budapest
buildings. The Lovas family,
attracted like moths to light,
steadily elbowed towards it.
Only Gyula Lovas, Albert and
Maria managed to keep to-
gether. Old Lovas, and the rest
of the family, four men and
two women, were lost in the
crowd, and . . . never seen
again.
/“YN the long and wide boule-
vards masses of workers
marched towards Radio Buda-
pest.
In the middle of the roads
stood deserted trams. In the
distance were conflagrations.
The demonstrators stormed
and overturned Avos vehicles
and burned them. Already
sporadic gunfire could be
heard.
The Avos fired on the crowd
storming Radio Budapest to
free their ten delegates. Many
were killed or wounded.
In the near-by Museum
Garden dead and wounded lay
on the freezing, sparsely grassed
ground.
“I should have my head
read,” Albert murmured to
Maria. “A few hours ago I
was desperately trying to get
away from the radio-building
and now I’m going back
there.”
Maria shrugged, walking on.
Lovas was too bewildered to
think.
But now the first consign-
ment of weapons and ammuni-
tion arrived for the demonstra-
tors. Civilians drove trucks
with Army registration-num-
bers. Lovas, who had served
as an officer in World War 11,
for the first time felt a stir
within himself. Instantly he
rejected the impulse to take
part. Paula, Tanias and the
flat vetoed any rash heroics.
“We should go and look for
Father and the others,” he
suggested.
“You might as well go and
look for a needle in a hay-
stack,” Maria said.
“If we have come this far we
might as well go and see for
ourselves. After all, 1 work
at the Radio,” Albert said.
The Army trucks stopped in
Kalvin-square, hardly a mile
away from Brody Sandar-street,
where the national transmitter
was. Young boys, hardly more
than fifteen, stormed the
trucks, clamoring for guns.
Lovas was terrified and
embittered by this youthful
enthusiasm. But soon he rea-
lised that the boys were not
alone. Watchwords and warn-
ings passed through the
crowds: “Beware of the blue-
uniformed Avos. The soldiers
are on our side —or, at the
least, they’re neutral.”
The Hungarian armored-
cars didn’t fire a shot at the
demonstrators. Some of their
crews turned against the Avos,
when the Avos killed an Army
officer. Others remained
neutral.
For the time being the only
active enemy were the Avos
defending the building of
Radio Budapest. The trapped
men had no choice but to fight
to the finish. But among the
Comrades there was divided
loyalty.
Ever since the Avos were

organised, after the Com-
munists took over in Hungary,
there was a “color-conscious-
ness” in their ranks. There
were the Blue Avos, whose
duties were political, and the
Green Avos, who served as
frontier-guards. Now the
Greens refused to “act against
the people.” Later, when the
uprising developed into a fully
fledged revolution they dissoci-
ated themselves from their Blue
comrades. “Never at any
time,” they said in a widely
read statement, “have we par-
ticipated in acts of suppression,
or in any atrocities. Our only
duty is to defend the Hungarian
Workers’ Republic.”
The Greens’ pledge was
taken by many with a bitter
smile. People remembered the
unfortunates shot dead by the
Greens, when trying to cross
the frontiers, and others they
had arrested and beaten.
But the main thing now was
to count friends, and kill
enemies. Even among the
Blues the rank-and-file refused
to fight against the people.
These were the normal con-
scripts, who hated their jobs
and disobeyed the orders of
their professional superiors.
The sixty on normal duty at
Radio Budapest had been dis-
armed and locked into the air-
raid shelter. Later, when the
rebels took over the building,
they were freed, and promptly
turned against their organi-
sation.
"lITHEN Lovas, Maria and
Albert arrived in front of
Radio Budapest, the fight
already raged inside.
Some of Albert’s colleagues
who had managed to get out
of the building told him that
the Avos were using civilian
employees as shields, firing and
then crouching behind a living
man or woman, knowing that
the demonstrators wouldn’t
shoot innocent people. Yet
many of the radio-staff were
killed; in proportion, their
casualties were greater than
those of most sections of the
population.
The weather turned cold and
gusty. Lovas was worried
about his father, and anxious
lest Paula should panic in his
absence. The three decided to
return-home.
A misty dawn twilighted
Rose Hill by the time Lovas
arrived home. Tam£s was
asleep, but Paula had waited
up.
“Where have you been all
night? I heard shots on the
radio! And the news is utterly
conflicting. Just what goes on
in the city?”
“That’s not so important as
Father. Any news about
him?”
“Father’s all right,” Paula
said. “He rang me about mid-
night. He said he lost you in
the crowd, and he’s staying
with some of his old cronies.
He’ll come back in the
morning.”
“Where did he ring from?”
Lovas asked.
“He didn’t say, and I forgot
to ask,” Paula said.
That was the last time they
heard from old Lovas.
In the following days they
searched feverishly but found
no trace of the old man. He
disappeared like thousands of
others, without a trace.
T OVAS slept a few hours,
then decided to return to
the city. Paula pleaded with
him to stay at home, but an
irresistible force drew him to
the battle.
He returned to the radio-
building, now in a fantastic
confusion. At times one of the
floors was in the Avos’s hands,
then it was occupied by the
rebels. Outside the crowd
waited anxiously. There was
a feeling that whoever got hold
of Radio Budapest would win
Hungary. An uninterrupted
Government or rebel broadcast
to the country and the outside
world on both sides of the Iron
Curtain could turn the balance.
In Karolyi Garden, not far
from Radio Budapest, the first
mass-grave of the rebels was
filled with the bodies of the
same young boys Lovas had
seen eagerly asking for
weapons ; all pupils of a tech-
nical college, the youth the
regime considered the flower
of the Hungarian Peoples’
Republic.
These boys had known little
else than the Communist State,
they were treated as privileged
persons, with the promise of
reaching good positions; yet
they were amongst the first to
fight and die for an ideal they
had never experienced.
Hungarian soldiers posted in
all parts of Budapest remained
passive onlookers. At the
same time Russian units entered
the city.
Before the demonstration
developed into a full-scale
revolution, the Russian Army
kept out of Budapest. The
Hungarian Communist Gov-
ernment and the Soviet were

SUGAR’S SWEET
The Bulletin had been told that
South Pacific Enterprise, a volume
giving an account of the activities
of the Colonial Sugar Refin-
ing Company, Ltd., and of the
Australasian sugar industry in general,
was a cross between the Holy
Bible and Gone With the Wind.
The description is not an accurate
one. Both the Bible and S.P.E-
are the work of many hands, but whereas
the authorship of the various books
from Genesis to Revelation is the
subject of unending controversy the
responsibility for each component part
of the sugar saga is sheeted home to the
economist, historian, journalist or C.S.R.
officer who wrote it. As to Gone With
the Wind, a diligent search of the pages
of South Pacific Enterprise has failed to
reveal anyone with the s 1 i g h t e's t
resemblance to Scarlett O’Hara. Still, it
may well be that if there had been no
C.S.R. there would have been no Summer
of the Seventeenth Doll.
C.S.R. did not originate the refining
of sugar in Australia ; nor did it begin
the growing of sugarcane; but it did
more than any other agency, private or
governmental, to put both branches of-
the industry on a stable and permanent
basis. For this the credit goes mainly to
the foresight and driving force of
Edward Knox, the Danish-born son of a
Scottish linen-merchant, and to his son
Edward William Knox. The first
founded the company; the second
pioneered the crushing-mills on the
N. S. Wales North Coast which set the
pattern for the development of the sugar
industry in Australia and Fiji. In
applying the principles of industrial
chemistry to sugar processing they and
their company probably led the world.
For more than a century C.S.R. has
refined the bulk of Australian sugar—
in recent years all but 25,000 tons of the
more than half a million tons consumed
annually in Australia and New Zealand.
The company also crushes a large share
of the cane-crop to manufacture raw
sugar; it owns seven of the 34
mills on the Australian canefields and all
five Fiji mills. Its mills in N. S. Wales
and Queensland produce about one-fifth
of all Australian raw sugar and, with an
annual production target of 261,000
tons, it makes twice as much raw sugar
as any other company in the British
Commonwealth.
In the early years the company was
itself a sugar-grower, but its canefields
were long ago disposed of to small-
farmers. At the beginning probably its
greatest contribution to the encourage-
ment of sugar-growing in Australia was
the establishment of central crushing-mills
which could guarantee small growers a
market for their cane. As a result of this
sugar, which elsewhere in the world was
a plantation crop, developed in Australia
as a small-farm proposition. C.S.R.’s
later, and continuing, contribution to
cane-growing lay in research —the
improvement of cane-quality; the
combating of insect-pests and plant-
diseases ; the seeking or breeding of
new and better varieties of cane. So suc-
cessful has this last field of activity been
that the entire sugar crop of N. S. Wales
is now produced from C.S.R. varieties,
and in Queensland 89 per cent, of all
cane passing through the company’s mills
is C.S.R. stock.
The Australian sugar industry, as
Queensland economist H. W. Herbert
points out in a chapter contributed to the
book, is the only one in the world of any
size operated solely by white labor. As
such it has resulted in the most successful
settlement of white people in a tropical
land. The cane is grown on 9000 farms
on a coastal strip stretching from the
Clarence River in N. S. Wales to Mossman
in North Queensland. Workers in the
industry receive higher wages than sugar-
workers elsewhere, except only Louisiana
and Hawaii, both of which sell their
product exclusively on the highly-
protected American market. Australia,
in contrast, now exports more sugar than
it keeps for home-consumption, yet the
retail price here is lower than in most
countries, including America.
Over the past half-century the position
of the Australian sugar-consumer has
varied considerably. There have been
times, as during the two World Wars
and the periods immediately following
th«m, when we got our sugar at far
below world prices—and still had it when
much of the world had to go without. On
the other hand there was a period extend-
ing from the late 1920’s down to the
beginning of the Second World War when
foreign sugar could have been landed
here at below home-consumption prices.
But on balance and taking into considera-
tion the vital part played by sugar in
developing the North, few Australians
would doubt that our support of home-
grown sugar has been well justified.
In view of its dominant position in the
sugar-industry it is not surprising that the
C.S.R. has often been the target for
abuse from folk who thought their sugar
should be cheaper or from politicians
looking for someone big to slug.
Nationalisation was considered and
rejected by a royal commission
in 1912. The efficiency of the
organisation was never in question.
Criticism hinged on profits, and in this
connection it is fair to point out that
from the time of its founding down to
World War I all the company’s profits
were earned in the face of world com-
petition. There were no restrictions on
the import of sugar; the tariff-protection
of £6 a ton went to the millers and
growers, not the refiners, as the company
paid for all raw sugar at world prices
plus freight plus duty, Billy Hughes was
in pre-1914 days one of the bitterest
critics of C.S.R., and when in 1915 he
placed an embargo on imports and
exports of sugar as a war-time measure
and fixed a price for raw sugar, he said,
“Now I have C.S.R. in the shafts. All I
have to do is hold the reins.”
In a sense C.S.R. has been in the shafts
ever since, but it has been rather a willing
horse. At any rate, it has worked like
one. Sugar today is the most strictly con-
trolled industry in Australia. There’s a
restriction on the acreage each farmer
may plant and a “peak” can be declared
on the crushing of any mill. The Central
Sugar Cane Prices Board fixes acreages
and peaks. The price of raw sugar is
fixed ; the price of refined sugar is fixed.
That more-or-less wraps-up the home-
consumption sugar from the moment the
cane is planted until the grocer hands a
21b. bag across the counter to Mrs. Brown.
But home-consumption sugar accounts
for less than half the crop. Export sugar
is also subject to strict controls. Under
the British Commonwealth Sugar Agree-
ment and the International Sugar Agree-
ment Australia has an export quota of
620,000 tons. Of this Britain contracts
to take 314,000 tons at a “negotiated
price”; the balance is sold at “world
price,” plus preference if sold in the
United Kingdom or Canada.
In practice all Australian raw sugar
goes into a marketing-pool under the
jurisdiction of the Queensland Sugar
Board, which contracts with the refining
companies for “handling, selling, refining
and financing the pool’s raw sugar.”
Under this contract the company arranges
shipping to supply its own refineries, sells
the surplus sugar abroad and arranges all
the required export shipping, refines Aus-
tralia’s requirements (except for the
Millaquin quantity), sells the refined sugar
and other sugar products in Australia,
and finances the whole operation. The
whole of the work is in the nature of a
contract for services supplied, and in much
of it C.S.R. is acting as agent for the Sugar
Board.
When the export agreement was first
made in 1925 the company undertook to
handle and finance the exports “without
charge for services and without interest.”
Of this undertaking J. M. Dixon, an
assistant-general-manager of the company,
comments in South Pacific Enterprise that
“although exports grew to more than
half of total raw-sugar production, this
contribution continued until recently and
still applies in part, but the financial
burden of advances on export sugar
became very considerable a few years ago
and a charge for financing it is now
made.”
Mr. Dixon takes pride in the fact that
this partnership between what he calls
“corporate capitalism” and growers,
millers, and Governments has stood the
test of over 30 years during which it
has been approved by successive Federal
Governments of various political colors
and by Queensland Governments which
have for almost the entire period been
Labor. Perhaps that explains why there’s
little agitation nowadays for nationalis-
ing sugar—a Gallup-poll taken on the
subject a couple of years ago showed only
13 per cent, in favor.

who also won the Warrnam-
bool Grand Annual last
month, surprised by running
close to the lead throughout.
It was thought that the two
miles and half a furlong would
not be far enough for the
Solar Bear gelding, who
usually drops out in his races.
Solight’s stablemate, Fran-
stone, started a warm favorite,
but made a bad jump which
put him out of the running.
Mrs. K. Schofield, who owns
property in the Hamilton
district, paid only £lOO for
Solight, who has won 14 races
for her.

At its June meeting last
year the V.R.C. originated the
mile Provincial Plate, and it
looks as if the race will be-
come an annual fixture. Con-
ditions of the race state that
it is for three-year-olds and
over who have started at least
four times outside a radius of
50 miles of the G.P.O. of the
capital city of any State within
12 months of the date of entry,
and who have not won a
metropolitan race within two
years of the same date;
starters to carry a weight set
according to age and sex. In
both years the race has had to
be divided, With the V.R.C.
allotting £lOOO for each divi-
sion.
• • • •:
Winner of the first division
last Saturday, Don Vista, is a
real “bush champion,” having
won 14 races, including five in
his last six starts. A five-year-
old gelding by Palm Vista out
of Mary Craib, he won as he
liked, and looked good enough
to tackle the moderate city
gallopers racing at this time
of the year.
Philstar, who is at his best
over the difficult straight-six
at Flemington, again showed
his liking for that track by
scoring a brilliant win in last
Saturday’s Royal Handicap.
Philstar sped over the six
furlongs in 1.111, unusually fast
time for a winter gallop. Owned
by grazier A. Thorp, the
winner is a four-year-old geld-
ing by Pamphilos (outstanding
sprinter on English tracks, and
successful sire of sprinters) out
of Miss Golea, who has pro-
duced the winners Goldbury
and Lady Djafar.
The five-year-old gelding
Sunium, who has disappointed
his connections repeatedly, won
his first race for 18 months
when he scrambled home by
half-a-head from the dead-
heaters for second money, Beau
Orator and Baroda Beam, in
the 12-furlongs Sandringham
Handicap. The finish was so
close that it looked as if the
triple dead-heat at the last
Melbourne Cup meeting
might be repeated. The Madden
brothers, who own Sunium,
had hoped that the gelding
would win this year’s Brisbane
Cup for them, but his disap-
pointing form prior to last
Saturday’s win convinced them
that it would be useless taking
him north. As the race was
run, Sunium was lucky to
win ; Beau Orator had a very
chequered run, and in another
stride would have taken first-
money.

Weights have been declared
for this year’s National Hurdle
and Steeple. As expected,
V.R.C. handicapper, Mr. Davis,
made Pedro’s Pride pay full
penalty for her outstanding
form this season. The big mare
has been allotted 11.12 in the
Steeple, equal topweight with
Arabil. Pedro’s Pride has
captured the imagination of
Victorian racegoers, and she
would not lack supporters in
the National despite her huge
weight, Interesting to note
that only two mares have won
the National Steeple this
century: Leah Kleshna (11.5,
in 1913) and Raiwena (9.13, in
1935).
• • • •
An analysis of the Steeple
weights indicates that The
Settler, who carried 9.6 when
he won the National last year,
and 10.5 in his Australian
Hurdle win, is not badly treated
with 11.3 ; but possibly the pick
of the weights is Elandery
(9.12), main hope of successful
Warrnambool trainer Kevin
Lafferty.
* •' • •
Allotted 11.7, Arabil is top-
weight in the Grand National
Hurdle. Redfield, who carried
10.13 when he won last year,
is well in with 11.3. Redfield’s
stablemate, Hay Harvest, who
ran second to Arabil in last
year’s Australian Hurdle, and
who may be the horse B. R.
Smith elects to ride, has 10.3,
and should run well, but Book
Value, with only 10.0, makes
ihe most appeal.

attractive programme, and It
looks as if the fixture will meet
with the support it deserves.
Many of today’s Sydney
trainers who were long associ-
ated with the old “pony” tracks
are still turning out their share
of winners. In fact, two of
them, Bob Mead and C. Ryan,
led in winners at Randwick
last Saturday ; first day of the
winter meeting. Mead won the
St. Aubins Maiden for fillies
and mares with Grey Magic ;
Ryan, the first Balmoral Stakes
with Passbook. Ryan also
supplied the runner-up,, Glid-
ing, in the St. Aubins Maiden,
while another former “pony”
mentor, Fred Russell, had two
minor placings with Vanderi
and Grove Hall.
Grey Magic got her grey coat
from her dam, Near Thing
(imp.), a grey mare bred in
England in 1944 and imported
to Australia five years later.
She was then located at Kooba
Stud, Darlington Point
(N.S.W.). Near Thing was got
by Nearco from Loelia (late
Meraud) by Blandford from
Lily of the Valley by
Tetratema. Mead is owner-
trainer of Grey Magic.
A pull in weight, plus ability
to handle soft going, and a
staying background, all assisted
outsider Wee Nilo to win the
A.J.C.’s Two-year-old Handi-
cap for fillies (run at seven
furlongs). The daughter of
Nilo (imp.) and Wee Did
was second - last into the
straight, but she finished
brilliantly in the soft ground
and won easily. She could do
well in staying events for three-
year-old fillies in the coming
season, as she traces back on
the dam’s side to Wallace. Her
dam is a Brueghel (It.) mare
from Woodbine by Backwood
(imp.). As a two-year-old Wee
Did defeated the subsequent
crack performer Bernborough
in a Toowoomba sprint.
Passbook scored narrowly in
the First Balmoral Stakes, N.
McGrowdie riding a well-
judged race. The Persian Book
(imp.) gelding is a brother to
Passion Queen, and is closely
related to Pipe On, a Rand-
wick winner. Passion Star,
dam of Passbook, is by St.
Andrew from Passion by Sion
from Barmaid’s Blush by
Magpie (imp.).
Jockey Alby Herford, who
rode his first city winner when
outsider Westdale finished fast
in the Second Balmoral Stakes
at Randwick, has been riding
many horses in training at
Rosebery, and, given his chance
by trainer A. G. Albrecht, he
handled the Binnia Hero geld-
ing with skill. Westdale hasn’t
done much racing, but was an
unlucky second at Newcastle
before winning at Randwick.

And Sundry Sports
They Cheered the Ref.
'T'HE Rugby Union match
between a Barbarian XV
and the visiting All Blacks,
played last Monday, recalls that
back around 1911 a team of the
Barbarian kind was organised in
Sydney by B. J. Swannell, who had
come here with two British teams,
one led by the Rev. Mullineaux,
the other by D. K. Bedell Sievright.
Swannell was a tough forward
who remained in Sydney to play with
Easts and was later to die on
Gallipoli leading a company of
Diggers in an assault near Lone
Pine. He died at about the same
time as his old skipper, “Darkie”
Sievright, who was killed at Hellas
with the 29th Divvy.
In addition to such State and
Australian reps, as Billy Hill, Tara
Baird, Snowy Baker and Ward
Prentice, the team included such
übiquitous Rugbyites as “General”
E. Booth, who vice-captained the
original All Blacks; Fred Aarons,
who represented on both sides of the
Tasman; and Tom Richards, an
English international who was an
early captain of the old Manly
club.
The team played plenty of fast,
open football as a rule, and had
some unorthodox approaches to its
games. When Blair Swannell led
out his men on to the field, they
first gave three cheers for the
referee; then, with clenched fists
and menacing gestures, gave a like
number of hoots for the opposition.
T his conduct was somewhat discon-
certing to the other XV, but after the
kick-off the opposition soon realised
it was in for a real game of clean
football, played by men who loved
the game for its own sake.
Usually the matches were arranged
with teams visiting Sydney, but any
team, representative or otherwise,
that wanted a game would be
accommodated.
Old Rep.
Weekend mixed-grill: The
All Blacks, before tackling
the Barbarians, cleaned-up the
A.C.T. 40-8 after beating-up
South West (N.S.W.) 86-0, a
record for a touring N.Z.
team ; in another Rugby Union
game, in Melbourne, Victoria
beat S.A. 27-8 ; at Soccer, in
Melbourne, the first of two
games, Victoria defeated
Queensland 4-3 ; English miler
Derek Ibbotson ran it in
3min. 58.45ec., the second-
fastest time on record ; Lewis
Hoad beat English Davis Cup
man Roger Becker in the final
of the West of England titles.
“Veryl”: Last year the New
Zealand Barbarians played one
match, against Auckland Pro-
vince on Oct. 6. (I haven’t the
result of the game at hand.)
However, an interesting feature
of this N.Z. Barbarians team
was that it included four Aus-
tralians, all of whom have
represented Australia five-
eighth Tooth, who captained
Australia against the All Blacks
this year, former Australian
captain Cameron, half-back
Cox and winger Stapleton. This
was the first time Australian
players had been invited to
play for the Barbarians outside
Australia.
In a hard and, fell the last
quarter-hour, even game in
Sydney’s Rugby Union, Rand-
wick defeated St. George 20-11;
the Saints led 11-8 at half-time,
but the Greens finished-up with
five tries to one. ’Wick lock-
forward Bob Outterside was
kicked in the head, and had to
withdraw from the Barbarians
side for the Monday game—
bad luck for Outterside, who
thus lost a good chance of im-
pressing the Wallabies selectors.
Still in his early ’twenties, a
strong, powerful lock with a
crashing run, he went to South
Africa in 1953 with the Aus-
tralians, but since has been
more-or-less out of the big-
time. Rand wick is now level on
points with St. George in
second-place behind Gordon,
which beat East 20-3. Big
Gordon winger John Law
scored his team’s four tries ; on
Easter Monday, against Drum-
moyne, Law had set a club-
record by scoring five tries, but,
off form, had since been back
to second-grade. University
beat North 14-3, North skipper
Phelps also being injured and
having to withdraw from the
Barbarians; Manly cracked
Eastwood 25-3 ; and Parra-
matta managed Drummoyne
11-6.

The first two games in the
1957 World Cup Rugby League
series, played on Saturday,
finished with almost identical
scores. In Brisbane, Australia
beat N.Z. 25-5, while in
Sydney England, holder of the
Cup, beat France 23-5. The
Brisbane game was the better
of the two. Australia led 10-2
at half-time, both sides playing
good solid football; there
wasn’t much between the two
teams up till then. In the
second half Australia ran away
with it. But Australia was beset
with injuries after the game,
and had to reconstruct its team
against England. Against
France England led 7-0
after smin., and it was 16-5
at half-time ; with the game
well in hand, England then
went along on half-steam, to
hold-off the disappointing
Frenchmen.
• • • •
In the last English season
Lewis Jones scored 42 tries and
kicked 175 goals (476 points
in all), a new record, beating
great fullback Jim Sullivan’s
433 points in 1934. A couple
of Jones’s brilliant efforts are
his 10 goals in the Brisbane
Test of 1954 and his 9 goals and
a try (after a great solo-run
from his own 25) when England
beat France 45-12 at Leeds in
January this year. Yet at other
times Jones has played so
poorly and half-heartedly that
England selectors have publicly
stated that they’ll never pick
him again—though they do.

No other drink satisfies more
than a fine Scotch . . . and in
White Horse, Scotch
Whisky reaches pure
perfection.
North Melbourne has had a
few close, exciting finishes this
year. It defeated Footscray by
two points, South Melbourne
by four points, Fitzroy by six
points and Hawthorn by nine
points, and was beaten by
Geelong by six points. On
Saturday, in one of the three
games played in the first half
of the split ninth round of the
V.F.L., North, well behind
Carlton at each change (at
threequarter-time it was only
2.9 to 7.13), came with great
heart and just failed (8.15-
7.14) —a t mere seven points
down.... One of the other
Saturday games, Richmond v.
Collingwood, was a gripping
battle, with ’Wood, on top and
17 points clear at threequarter-
time, eventually going under
—also by a goal and behind —
when the Tigers came in the
last quarter with some of the
old “Eat ’em alive” spirit
(13.14-12.13).
Essendon (V.F.L.) and
carnival centreman Jack Clarke
is the elder brother of miler
Ron Clarke, who was the final
runner in the Olympic torch-
relay last year and carried the
flame into the arena. Last year,
in his “off-season,” Jack
Clarke did a lot of rigorous
training with his 'brother, and
it’s paid off. He’s been the
“form” V.F.L. centreman this
year, and his selection in the
Victorian side followed logi-
cally. An important factor in
Fred Gallagher’s 12 goals
against Geelong was that
Clarke, controlling the centre,
“fed” him all day.
“Old Pivot”: Hawthorn’s
V.F.L. win over Essendon on
the Dons’ own ground (B.
29/5/’57) wasn’t its first success
away from home this year. The
Hawks beat Carlton at Prince’s
Oval, Carlton, in the opening
game of the season. Curiously,
the inability of even the top
six teams to beat the six lower
teams on the latter’s grounds is
one of the features of this most
topsy-turvy season. Hawthorn’s
win at Essendon was its first
there for 20 years.
“Kejokada”: In the eighth
round of the V.F.L., against
Essendon, Geelong kicked its
highest score of the year
(15.12) —and lost ; while in the
previous round, against Mel-
bourne, Richmond had kicked
its lowest score of the year
(7.10) —and won!
“Maros”: 'John Gerovich,
mentioned (B. 5/6/’57) as
having kicked two successive
big. tallies from centre-half-
forward, was again right on
target the following Saturday
(25/5/’57) with 7.3 in South
Fremantle’s 19.11-18.12 win
over West Perth. Apropos, in
winning these three successive
games South nevertheless had
51 goals kicked against it —
very rare in any League com-
petition, I’d think.

In the U.S. Open golf
championship defending cham-
pion Cary Middlecoff and
Dick Mayer tied for first,
necessitating a play-off. Peter
Thomson crashed over the final
stages, to finish (with three
others) 22nd. Thomson’s card
read 71, 72, 74, 77-294-12
strokes behind the winners.

Some particulars about William
Cobbett, mentioned in an
“Aboriginalities” par. (B. 29/5/’57) ?
Born in Surrey (Eng.) in 1763, his
father being a small-farmer who
combined his farming with innkeep-
ing, he enlisted at 21 and, as
regimental sergeant-major, went with
the 54th Regiment to New Bruns-
wick (America); at the same time
he read everything he could find, and
set about educating himself. Dis-
covering peculations by some
officers, he secured his discharge on
returning to England in 1791 and
demanded a court-martial; but in
turn he himself was accused of
treasonous conduct, and he fled to
France, and on to America. There
he turned to pamphleteering, becom-
ing what amounted to an unofficial
propagandist for Britain and being
extremely critical of France, America
and their British sympathisers.
Finally he became involved and
ruined in a libel-suit, and in 1800
returned to England. In 1802,
backed by some influential Govern-
ment members, he founded and
edited the weekly “Political
Register,” which began as a sup-
porter of Government policy, but
later changed (under the guidance of
its editor) into a Radical journal. In
1810 Cobbett was jailed for two
years, and in 1817, on the suspen-
sion of the Habeas Corpus Act, fled
to America to escape another jail-
sentence —incidentally, then seeing
the America of which he had
previously been so highly critical as
"a paradise of free men.” (The
“Register” continued to come out in
England, and Cobbett wrote for it
from America.) He was an earnest
advocate of Parliamentary reform,
and was returned as a member of the
first Reform Parliament (1832), but
was by then too old to achieve any
marked success. However, he did
make several eloquent speeches in
Parliament urging what he con-
sidered necessary reforms. He died
on June 18, 1835. He wrote many
books, mostly of a utilitarian nature,
such as The English Gardener,
Advice to Young Men, Cobbett’s
Cottage Economy and, his best and
most famous work, Rural Rides.
Margaret Cole, in Makers of the
Labor Movement (1948), says that
what he did was “to uphold the
rights and strengthen the heart of
the common man, and he did this
in some of the best prose in all
English literature.”

Directions for the bleaching of
wood with pyrogallol and ferrous-
sulphate ?
Here is the formula, you require,
but it should be noted that the
work calls for experience and a
knowledge of the physiology of the
particular wood being treated —
timbers vary greatly ‘in their
reaction to chemicals by reason of
their age at the time of cutting and
seasoning, etc. Prepare a mixture
of one part pyrogailic acid in 25
parts warm water, and when dis-
solved coat the wood with it. Allow
to dry. Prepare a solution of green
vitriol two parts in boiling water
5C parts, and paint it over the first
coating on the wood. This should
produce the desired result, but it
may be necessary to repeat. Try a
small piece of wood first.

Brief biography oj Sir George
Reid ?
Born at Johnstone, near Paisley
(Scotland), on Feb. 25, 1845, he
was the son of the Rev. John Reid,
a Presbyterian clergyman, who
came to Melbourne with his family
in 185'*.. Young George Reid was
educated at the Melbourne Academy,
later to become Scotch College. In
!058 his father moved to Sydney to
become the colleague of Rev. John
Dunmore Lang, and young Reid
obtained a position as junior clerk
i n a Sydney merchant's office. In
1878 he was appointed secretary to
the Crown Law Offices, also studied
lor the Bar, and was admitted to
practice in 1879. In 1880 he won
the East Sydney seat in the Legisla-
tive Assembly, and, except for one
defeat, was to represent East Sydney
lor the remainder of his Australian
political life. In 1883 he became"
Minister for Public Instruction, but
soon afterwards lost his seat on a
technicality; he was re-elected in
1885, and began to take a great
part in the Free Trade-Protection
issue, on the Free Trade side. In
1891, when the Parkes Ministry was
defeated, he became Leader of the
Opposition in succession to Sir
Henry, who retired from leadership;
and in 1894 became Premier. In
1897 he was one of the 10 N.S.W.
delegates to the Federal convention
in Adelaide, but was not elected to
any committee. He was regarded
as a lukewarm advocate of Federa-
tion, in March, 1898, making the
famous “Yes-No” speech (so
labelled by The Bulletin) in which
it was uncertain what were his exact
views on Federation. In Sept.,
1899, he was defeated as Premier by
Sir William Lyne. At the first
Federal election Reid was leader of
the Free Trade party in the House
of Representatives, becoming Prime
Minister (August, 1904) of a coali-
tion Government—of his party and
a section of Deakin's. Never with
a majority of more than two, he
remained in office till June, 1905.
In 1909 he resigned leadership of his
party, and at the end of the year
accepted the newly created office of
High Commissioner in London. He
lieiu the post for six years, and was
then elected to the House of Com-
mons; but he had hardly settled in
there when he died in London (Sept.
12, 1918).

Is peat-moss used in nurseries? If
so, price, and where obtained ?
Peat-moss is extensively used in
nurseries for the pottipg of fine
young plants; its moisture-retaining
quajities are excellent and it is liked
by plants. Nurserymen could
scarcely work without it. It is
obtainable from all the larger seeds-
men or florists in most country
towns, or can be supplied by Arthur
Yates & Co. Pty., Ltd., 184 Sussex-
street, Sydney. A small packet of
Hlb. costs 3s. 9d.; 1 bushel, 10s.;
larger quantities in bundles quoted

Reliable treatment for house-posts
which have become infected with
white-ants ?
First find the main nest of the
which will be somewhere in the
vicinity of the house. Break-up
the nest, kill the ants with a two per
cent, solution of chlordane or boil-
ing water, and destroy all channels
which lead to the house. Scrape
the posts as clean as possible of
ants and their channels, then thor-
oughly saturate the posts with a
mixture of one part wood-preservitfg
oil and 10 parts kerosene. Allow
the sludge to settle, then pour off
the clear liquid—though for a rough
timber job this clearing is not
important provided the mixture is
kept well stirred when being used.
Paint on liberally with a large
brush; when dry apply a second or
even third coat. Keep the posts clear
of rubbish, pieces of timber, weeds,
etc., and inspect occasionally. If
posts are badly infested, they should
be replaced to prevent entry of ants
into house.

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(7/6/’57)
General rains are indicated in a large part of Queens-
land during July, although there may be only poor rainfall
in north-west and far-west areas and on the peninsula. The
heaviest' rains are indicated in southern Queensland.
Good general rains are likely in most of N.S.W. during
July, heaviest on the coast and in the northern areas of the
State. The southern tablelands may get only light to
moderate rains. Apart from reasonably good rains in Sep-
tember, rainfall should be patchy during spring.
In Victoria, rains may be mainly below normal during
July, although good rains may occur in the east-central,
north-east, and western districts. Fairly heavy rain likely
during August and September.
Moderate rains are indicated in the agricultural areas
of South Australia during July, with light rain in the
interior, Murray Valley, and west coast areas. The main
cycle indicates excellent rain throughout the whole of the
State, so some variation is possible.
In Western Australia, general rains in the agri-
cultural areas during July, with the heaviest falls between
Perth and Bunbury. Mainly dry on the Kimberleys, with
light, patchy rains elsewhere.

A DAY WITH THE GALWAY
BLAZERS
“The meet” was a place where we oft
met before,
The sport was so good, we were looking
for more;
The Master and members welcomed
their guests
Who came to West Galway, the hunting
to test.
There was frost on the ground, and a
nip in the air,
And the shoes of the horses were
sharpened with care.
Chorus.
Tally Ho, Tally Ho, gone away, gone
away,
The sound of the horn in a place tar
away
Still rings in my ears, recalling the
story
Of horses and hounds and youth in it*
glory.
The hounds were cast in, to a wood near
a mill,
They .soon found a fox, and pressed
him until
He broke covert, with the wind on his
back,
Closely pursued by the keen Blazer pack.
With the scent fresh and strong, the
pace was a cracker,
And five-feet stone walls, was no place
for a slacker.
The Empress of Austria, our guest,
made us stare,
As she faced those stiff fences, like any-
one there.
A few empty saddles was an eloquent
token
That the going was tough, as we raced
o’er the open.
The scent was breast-high over hill, dale
and rocks;
While the hounds gave tongue as they
closed on their fox.
But cunning old Reynard was up to his
tricks,
And to save his good brush, with some
sheep he did mix ;
This caused a check but the huntsman
cast forward,
The hounds soon told on a line that
led northward
Over some country to old Oranmore,
Where the fox went to earth, after miles
a full score.
We then turned for home and shortened
the way,
By talking of foxes and the tricks that
they play,
And relating the story of “Finnegan's
Hen,’’
That the foxes killed over and over
again.
Tally Ho, Tally Ho, gone away, gone
away,
The sound of the horn in a place far
away
Still rings in my ears, recalling the
story
Of horses and hounds and youth in its
glory.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
NASSER
'THE week's talk in Baghdad
between King Feisal of
Irak and King Saud of Saudi
Arabia—which resulted in a
warning to the Soviet not to
interfere in the Middle East
—interpreted by Edinburgh
“Scotsman” as a “chill wind”
for Nasser:
“It is true that both coun-
tries are hostile to Israel and to
that extent support Egypt, but
Jordan, Irak and Saudi Arabia
are not enamored of Nasser’s
attempt to provide leadership
for an Arab Empire. They
resent the pressure applied to
Jordan, and they object to the
way in which Egypt has tried
to undermine King Saud's
authority in Saudi Arabia.
“Irak, who was being treated
rather as an Ishmael because
of her adherence to the Bagh-
dad Pact —her link with the
Western Powers —has now
emerged as a natural leader
in the defence of the Middle
East against Soviet penetra-
tion, which is, after all, the
role assigned to her in the
Baghdad Pact. Nasser seems
to have overplayed his hand.
The resistance offered by King
Hussein has defeated the effort
of Russia by means of Egypt
and Syria to direct Jordan's
policy
“It would be fallacious to
imagine that this turn of events
will be entirely favorable to
British policy. On the con-
trary, it would appear that
Irak will support Saudi
Arabia’s claims to the Buraimi
Oasis and to Aden, but the
dominant note sounded in
Baghdad is one of alarm about
Russian penetration in the
Middle East. The Eisenhower
Doctrine is evidently gathering
strength because its basic warn-
ing against Russian ambitions
is well founded.
“That becomes clearer to the
Middle East countries as the
complication of a struggle
with the West over Suez is
removed. King Saud’s income
and authority would not last
long if the Communists got a
foothold in his country, and he
has come to realise that. His
devotion to ‘positive neutral-
ism’ falls a long way short
of submitting to Russian
dictation.”
Surveying the same scene for
“New York Times,” and with
particular reference to . the
Eisenhower Doctrine, C. L.
Sulzberger comments that all
the Arab States except Egypt
and Syria now show some
appreciation of the doctrine or
its intentions. In this, he adds,
U.S. Foreign Secretary Dulles
deserves as much credit for
stabilising an unpromising
London “Daily Mail”
“O.K., NOW WE ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS, LETS
SHOVE IT BACK IN THE BOTTLE”
situation as he deserved blame
for past American ineptitude
in the area.
In diplomacy, Sulzberger
adds, there are four cardinal
rules:
“Rule one is always keep
the initiative. Rule two is
always exploit the inevitable.
Rule three is always keep in
with the outs. And rule four
is never stand between a dog
and a lamp-post.”
“Where we [America] went
wrong in the past,” he con-
tinues, “was in ignoring these
precepts. We have now seen
the folly of violating rules one
and four—above all vis-a-vis
Cairo. Henceforth we must
concentrate on rules two and
three.”
Sulzberger suggests that
American policy should recog-
nise an inevitable trend in
“the increasingly intense search
for popular government in the
Middle East”:
“This favors the activities
of ‘outs,’ the opposition. And
there is opposition everywhere.
We saw it explode in Jordan.
It bubbles beneath the surface
in Irak. It even exists in Saudi
Arabia, where members of the
Royal family were involved in
a Nasser-inspired plot against
the King.
“It is as necessary for us
[the U.S.] to be in contact with
non-Communist ‘outs’ in those
countries as it is, for example,
useful to retain intimate con-
nections with British Labor
leaders and German Social
Democrats something we
have not always done. Like-
wise it is essential that we know
what the opposition plans in
Syria and Egypt.
“This is far from easy. Ours
is not a conspiratorial system
like that of the Soviet Union.
We do not wish or intend to
practise subversion to accom-
plish our objectives. Nor are
these objectives as simple to
define as those of Moscow:
world revolution and Com-
munist domination.”
U.S. policy has, however,
“moved forward from a slough
of inactivity” and “there is no
reason to assume that we can-
not maintain the pace”:
“For some months it is pro-
bable there will be no especi-
ally dramatic developments in
the Middle East —unless Russia
has new surprises in store. And
without dramatic developments
we can gain time to encourage
needed reforms.
“In the political field we
must cement friendship be-
tween the Baghdad Pact and
those States not tied directly
to the Cairo-Damascus axis.
We must develop regional
economic co-operation. Ulti-
mately—long hence —this may
create an atmosphere for
formal Arab-Israeli peace.
“In the social field we must
press for greater distribution of
wealth. Too many oil royalties
benefit royalty alone. Irak is
showing how such funds can
benefit a populace.
“In the psychological field
we must encourage moderate
elements to regain control of
educational and propaganda
facilities from Moscow and
Nasser, its cold - war co-
belligerent. Here we and our
friends are starting late. Even
in friendly Irak, Kuwait and
Libya the proportion of
Egyptian-trained teachers is
immense. And what most of
them teach is anathema to us.
“Our. difficulty, in the long
run, is that we have no abso-
lute idea to peddle, unlike
Russia with its Big Lie tech-
nique. We can demonstrate at
least that we are prepared to
stand up firmly for the half-
truth.”
Meanwhile it is suggested by
A. P. Herbert in London
“Daily Telegraph” that Britain
“should draw Colonel Nasser's
attention to the Nile”:
“Beside the canal British
subjects are imprisoned or
expelled: British property is
stolen. Beside the Nile, on
British territory, at Owen Falls,
three Egyptian engineers sit un-
molested still, to be sure that
each contracted drop, no more,
no less, goes through our dam
at the contracted time.
“On the canal we use the
water by the grace and favor
of the Emperor Nasser; and the
insulting hiss of ‘colonialism’ is
heard if we ask for decent
behavior. On the Nile 20-
million Egyptians cultivate and
multiply by virtue of the
mighty water-works that British
‘colonialism’ designed, financed,
and carried through.
“These great structures, with
a network of minor ones, the

fruit of 80 laborious years,
range from Lake Victoria to
the Mediterranean, nearly
3500 river miles. God made
the Nile: but Britain made it
work. All the big works, except
the Sennar dam in the Sudan,
were for the benefit of Egypt.”
After examining the rights
and interests in the Nile of
various countries Britain,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanganyika,
Belgian Congo, Uganda, Sudan
—Herbert comments that “we
[Britain] should summon all
the countries with riparian
rights and interests to consider
the final Plan of the Nile, by
which this mighty gift of water
shall be controlled, conserved,
and employed to the fair
advantage of all. Egypt should
be invited too ; but not on the
‘most favored nation’ terms
she enjoyed before.
“Meanwhile those three
Egyptians should be expelled
from Owen Falls at once. All
this nonsense about Egypt’s
having a share in the control of
Lake Victoria should be set
aside, and her meagre contri-
bution should be returned to
her. No aid should go to the
Aswan dam unless all the
experts approve.
“The Nile, in short, should
no longer be considered as an
Egyptian perquisite, but as an
international asset in which she
must deserve her share. We
do not wish to starve the living
Egyptians, as, in certain condi-
tions, I suppose, we could. But
the world is under no strong
obligation to inflate Egyptian
prosperity.”
Exporting Atoms
largest national nuclear-power
programme in their home
country, Britain. Yet the-fact
that there should be, after
Calder Hall, any doubt about
the sale of a British nuclear-
power plant to Japan or
Germany is in the light of
circumstances surprising.
“Neither the Japanese nor
Britain’s successful building,,
of the world’s first industrial-
sized nuclear-power station,
and the likelihood that it will
receive orders from Germany
and Japan for nuclear-power
plants, have given John Bull
the edge on Uncle Sam in these
things. The next task will be
to hold the lead already
established.
In an editorial assessment of
form, London “Financial
Times” comments that “Britain
is building nuclear-power
plants that require a relatively
simply obtainable fuel, natural
uranium. The U.S. is building
nuclear-power plants requiring
a rarer and more difficult to
obtain fuel, enriched uranium
. a fuel that can only be
obtained today in quantity
from the U.S. or Russia.
“The U.K. companies have
been slow to follow up this
lead in the export field.
Admittedly they are heavily
committed to the world’s
London “Time and Tide”
BY THE SUEZ
the Germans are likely in the
first instance to do other than
buy one British nuclear-power
plant and one United States
one. Neither Japan nor
Germany is likely to commit
itself to a power-programme
which is dependent on the' feel-
ings of the U.S. Congress for
the supply of the enriched
uranium fuel for its continu-
ance in the years to come.
“Therefore Britain has the
fundamental advantage that
natural uranium fuel is readily
available to any nation indus-
trially developed enough to
manufacture it. The question
remains as to how quickly
German and Japanese scientists
and engineers can learn to make
the natural uranium - fuel
elements and to build the
reactor-furnaces and ancillary
units of a nuclear-power plant.
“The energy needs of both
Japan and Germany are such
that the second and probably
the third nuclear-power plants
to be ordered must be decided
upon before these problems of
‘know-how’ are solved. That
is unless the U.K. companies
can come to agreement with
the German and Japanese com-
panies for the sale not of hard-
ware, or manufactured parts,
or completed units, such as
entire reactor-furnaces made in
Britain, but of ‘know-how.’ If
Britain is to export nuclear-
power plants she must do it by
selling not completed plants
but the ‘know-how’ which she
alone today possesses in the
world, but which she will not
monopolise for long.”
On the subsequent Japanese
decision—as predicted by the
“Financial Times”—to buy one
atomic-power station from
Britain and one from the
U.S., Edinburgh “Scotsman”
comments that “on technical
performance Britain might
reasonably have scooped up
the whole of this great market”:
“Instead of an outright
commercial victory we have
a drawn battle. Months ago
it was clear that the
Japanese appreciated the
achievement of Calder Hall,
and they seemed on the point
of choosing an all-British pro-
gramme. In the interval came
the clamor to stop H-bomb
tests, chiefly aimed at Britain.
“It was conceivable that Japan
might have exploited the diplo-
matic bargaining-power of the
contract, but her decision does
not in fact seem to have been
influenced by Britain’s refusal
to call off the test. A more
potent force intervened, the
force of ruthless American
salesmanship.”
Agreeing that American
salesmanship played its part in
the Japanese decision, London
“Economist” adds that “the
smokescreen set up by
American atomic salesmen in
Tokyo, who have been busily
attacking British atomic plants
in preference to explaining why
their own projects are running
behind schedule and costing
well above estimate, seems to
have been intended to draw
attention away from what looks
like being the final Japanese
decision on the 'matter.
“Two new installations [in
Japan] will be relatively small
by current standards, only
140,000 kw. The American
design will probably be one of
the pressurised-water types,
while a delegation headed by
the Japanese Minister in charge
of atomic energy is coming to
Britain to look at what varia-
tions of the classical Calder
Hall type of gas-cooled, natural

uranium reactor the four main
atomic groups have to offer.
“Japanese technical experts
have already come down
heavily in favor of atomic
power on the British pattern ;
but it is not surprising that the
Government has chosen to try
out at least one American
reactor at the same time,
especially bearing in mind the
heavy American sales-pressure
to which it has been subjected.”
Cost of War
Noting that this year’s
British White Paper on defence
allowed nearly £550 million for
production and defence during
the coming year (although
production orders for some of
the most expensive types of
equipment— namely aircraft —
have been drastically cut back
and several new projects
abandoned), London “Econo-
mist” sets out the cost of some
of the main items:
“Guided weapons appear
relatively cheap in comparison
with aircraft, but they are
highly expendable pieces of
equipment ; while an aircraft
on test by the Services usually
completes its trials intact, it is
customary to have to fire as
many as 100 rounds of any
one guided weapon before it is

number. In the United States
it has already been discovered
that missiles are not the short-
cut to economy that they
sometimes seem. The German
Vi’s founded this legend
because they were cheap and
simple to make, but subsequent
generations of missiles have
become both more compli-
cated and more expensive.”

Mr. Dulles and the
Press
U.S. Secretary of State
Dulles’s long-standing refusal
to allow U.S. newspapermen to
visit Red China hangs about his
neck like an albatross and he
has been collecting editorial
side-swipes on the subject for
months.
In its latest crack at him,
New York “Herald Tribune”
comments that the more he
“tries to defend his ban on
American newspapermen enter-
ing Red China, the more
tangled he becomes in his own
arguments” :
“A few weeks ago he came
up with the suggestion that a
‘pool’ of a few reporters be

permitted to go to China. The
American press rightly rejected
this doctrine as an intrusion on
the right of newspapers to
cover legitimate news without
Governmental restriction and
interference.
“At his latest press con-
ference, Mr. Dulles came up
with a new one —the idea that
the press of the United States
employ foreigners to gather
news for them in Red China.
And he also threw in a new
State Department interpreta-
tion of the First Amendment to
the Constitution, which is that
the doctrine of freedom of the
press relates only to the pub-
lication of news, and not to the
gathering of news.
“We believe that most
Americans will reject Mr.
Dulles’s contentions on both
points. For an American news-
paper to rely strictly on the
reports of foreign nationals in
areas where American news-
papermen are banned by
Washington is unthinkable.
And to interpret the First
Amendment as a means of re-
stricting, rather than encourag-
ing the flow of information is
to resort to legalism in a situa-
tion that demands imagination
and enterprise.
“What the State Department
attitude comes down to, plainly
and simply, is an attempt to
turn the American press into an
instrument of foreign policy,
This is a drastic departure
from the American tradition
which permits newsmen to
work in danger areas—such as
war zones—where the general
public is barred, and countries
such as Soviet Russia—which
maintain an unfriendly atti-
tude. The job of the press is
to get the story for the people,
The job of the State Depart-

Russia's "Festival of
Youth"
Following up R. G. Casey’s
description of the forthcoming
Soviet World Festival of
Youth and Students —“a
massive Communist propa-
ganda undertaking to offset the
loss of prestige in Hungary”—
London “Time and Tide”
describes some of the prepara-
tions :
“A stadium is being com-
pleted with a seating-capacity
of 103,000 and there is to be
a smaller arena with a
capacity of 16,000. The new
swimming-pool will be large
enough for 13,000 and a sports-
centre will hold 11,000. In
addition to the sports events
there will be 60 daily concerts,
63 daily film-shows, drama and
ballet festivals, river regattas,
aerial displays, art and photo-
graphy exhibitions, horse-trials
and ice-skating displays in
fact, something for everyone.
The climax of the Festival will
be a ball in the Kremlin, given
by the youth of Moscow, and
a grand carnival at the Central
Park of Culture and Rest.” ■
The largest delegations will
be from Asia, Africa and Latin
America, but the organisers
claim 2000 applications from
Britain, 800 from Norway and
97 from the U.S.A. They are
promised “food to suit all
tastes, prepared by cooks
brought from all over the
world,” which will be free, as
will hospitality and all local
transport in Moscow itself.
As against the aim of the
festival “to bring 30,000
young people to Moscow and
to convince them that the
future belongs to Communism”
—“Time and Tide” suggests
that the occasion, “if imagina-
tively handled by the West,
could be a two-edged sword ;
for it is the young in the Soviet
orbit who have lately begun
to ask questions about the
present regime.” .
Rock-V-roil
Peking radio (as noted by
“Manchester Guardian”) might
find some agreement in the
West with at least a few of its
criticisms of “rock-’n’-roll”:
“Rock-and-roll music, which
originates in the U.S.A., the
headquarters of the yellow
culture of the world, is full of
crazy beats and tunes. Those
who dance to the musical beat

Various Voices
Prime Minister Macmillan :
“By itself, banning tbe bomb
would not prevent a war: it
would merely make it virtually
certain that if it came we
should lose it. The H-bomb
neutralises the strategic ad-
vantages Soviet Russia derives
from her vast and regimented
manpower. Remove the
nuclear weapons without deal-
ing with what are called
conventional weapons and all
the advantage would be tilted
back the wrong way.”

Oliver Poole, chairman of
Britain’s Conservative - party
organisation: “Essential
though the Anglo-American
partnership is to the future of
the whole free world, it has
got to be a real partnership:
in no circumstances must we
ever allow ourselves to slip into
a position of satellite status or
permanent dependence on
America. That is one reason
why our decision to become a
nuclear Power in our own right
is so important and so vital to
us all.”

Viscount Lambton (Con-
servative M.P .): “It is said
that we cannot afford to go
round the Cape. It may well
be that the expense would be
cheap compared to what we
shall have to pay to Nasser in
the future. We are putting
ourselves in the hands of a
man who has always thrived on
opposition to British influ-
ence.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Communists
“E. & 0.E.,” referring to the
defection of well-known Com-
munists from the party (B.
15/5/’57), asks why people
should suddenly defect after
years of following the party-
line.
He does not answer the ques-
tion, though he suggests that
lack of accurate knowledge of
conditions in Russia might
account for this slavish attach-
ment. This seems to take in-
sufficient account of the fervor
of some Communists whose
devotion, in a Western country,
would usually be associated
with religious belief.
Is it possible to find the
source of this devotion by
examining the Russian social
system? We get a clue if we
consider the needs of youth,
and how Communism is made
to meet them. Youth is the
time of altruism and idealism,
a time when many young
people seek a solution to the
world’s problems. They want
a cause to believe in and an
enemy to oppose. In Iron
Curtain countries Communism
is dealt to them on a platter.
This ideology (quite erroneously
to our minds) claims to inter-
pret the whole of life satisfac-
torily. Moreover, it offers a
cause to strive for—the future
Communist State and an
enemy to fight—the evil of
capitalists and the capitalist
system.
With the whole Communist
State —radio, theatre and school
—geared to propaganda, many
vouths must inevitably espouse
this cause. Once a young
person in his zeal has made
't wholehearted identification of
himself with a cause, bonds
>re wrought which even the
truth may well find impreg-
nable. In fact, much evidence
eems to suggest that even if
the truth about the West could
penetrate the Iron Curtain it
would fight a losing battle with
the people. Dismal testimony
of the effectiveness of Russian
propaganda is not difficult to
find.
Stewart Alsop, the noted
American columnist, visited
Russia and claimed to a group
of Russian workers that the
American Government was not
the tool of the Ford Company
and other industrial firms. The
Russians’ response was polite
but complacent laughter. Alsop
could not reason with them —
they had been thoroughly
convinced of the “truth” about
America.
A delegation of British
university-students who visited
U.S.S.R. in 1951 found Russian
students woefully ignorant
about life in England. They’
had read Dickens, and firmly
believed that his mordant
accounts of 19th-century social
conditions were true portraits
of contemporary English
society. The young Russians
asked why Britain was arming
and allowing American bases
on British soil. When it was
explained that fear of Russia
was behind this, the students
laughed—as if Russia would
want a war!
Against such an attitude,
particularly on the part of
intelligent young people, one
.feels helpless. Far better to
be met with hostility than a
twisted complacency that
illustrates only too well how
thoroughly many Russians
have assimilated the “truth”
propounded by their leaders.
Communism certainly presents
a challenge to democracy, and
not the least part of the chal-
lenge is how to deal with a
people who have been con-
vinced that their own policies
are always right and that they
have a monopoly of the truth.
—Kemar (Vic.).
Municipal Libraries
While the provision of a
good reference-library might be
one of the many responsibilities
of a municipal council, it’s
hard to concede that providing
ratepayers with free murder-
mysteries, romances and the
like is a local-government
undertaking.
Strangely enough, these free
libraries are operating in muni-
“Very economical—but you’ve got to be extra quick on
your feet when they touch down."
cipalities where many of the
roads are in a shocking condi-
tion—it is doubtful if the
mobile library that operates
in the Fairfield (N.S.W.) muni-
cipality, as an additional con-
venience to the two permanent
free libraries, could safely
travel over some of the roads
that Fairfield ratepayers are
forced to use.
If the provision of free read-
ing-matter to residents is a
legitimate function of a muni-
cipal council, then it might just
as well turn on free picture-
shows, milk, fruit, vegetables
and even beer. —E ureka
(N.S.W.).
Bankrupts
In seeking causes of bank-
ruptcy, “Xavier” (B. 22/5/’57)
should surely have enlarged
on lack of business-education
as a powerful factor.
Keen competition has raised
business to the status of a
science. A large firm insists on
qualified accountants, sales-
managers and advertising
executives for its staff. It
would not survive without
them. How, then, can small
concerns hope to win through
when proprietors and/or
employees have very limited
knowledge of commerce?
Unless able to afford the ser-
vices of an outside accountant
or other advisers, a man starting
in business, however well
capitalised, should have at least
a basic understanding of book-
keeping, taxation, buying, sell-
ing and discounts. Such a
grounding is easily and inex-
pensively acquired from busi-
ness colleges.
Of the enlightening figures
quoted by “Xavier,” it would
be interesting to know, if
possible, what percentage of
failures could be charged to
pure ignorance of funda-
mentals. — Arthur Falk (Vic.).

remain. The civic centre is a
jumble of bank - branches,
offices and shops inadequately
serving five suburbs of the
far-flung capital area. In the
offing are two lofty blocks of
flats, seemingly built of flat-
tened kerosene-tins.
There are some good build-
ings in Canberra. Between
Hotel Canberra (not a bad pub)
and the civic centre there are
the severe and pleasing Insti-
tute of Anatomy (housing a
cast of the skull of Ned Kelly
and the heart of Phar Lap),
the University, the community
hospital and Albert Hall.
There is also the Federal head-
quarters of the Australian
Labor Party —a longgalvanised-
iron shed never treated to a
coat of paint since the day of
its erection. On the other side
there are the Patents Office, the
uncompleted National Library,
the blocks of Government
offices in the vicinity of Parlia-
ment House and the mammoth
administrative offices which
will have cost as much as a
Dreadnought or . two when
completed.
But the recent building,
here, there and everywhere, is
shocking. There is no attempt
at uniformity in material or
design and there are atrocities
resembling railway-yards, run-
ning-sheds, and nondescript
erections for housing and other
purposes. The crime-de-la-
crime is the 1400-house pro-
ject at Narrabundah —1400
grave offences. These fibrolite
shacks are what one would
expect to find in a remote holi-
day fishing-resort, and they are
jammed together like sardines
in a tin.
Apologists say that some of
the building is temporary;
some provisional. The distinc-
tion is too fine for me. Parlia-
ment House is in the temporary
category. It is not unpleasing
and Queen’s Hall is really fine,
but it is showing signs of wear
and tear; repairs and main-
tenance are costly items, and
with the intrusion of Ministers’
offices the building is already
inadequate for the demands
upon it. Australians should
not begrudge expenditure of a
few millions worthily to house
their national Parliament on,
say, Capital Hill.
As to Canberra generally:
the Griffin Plan must be written
off, but something may yet be
salvaged from the wreck and a
city created not altogether un-
worthy of a magnificent setting.
—G. Elburg (N.S.W.).
X-rays
In the children’s shoe depart-
ment of a large city-store I was
struck by the wholesale use
of X-rays to check fittings. The
casual acceptance on the part
of both adults and children of
what we have long been told
is an insidious danger was
forcibly illustrated, and a few
days later it was announced
that both the A.C.T. and
N. S. Wales were considering
prohibiting the machines.
Unlike the frightening and
confusing scientific speculation
on fall-out from nuclear explo-
sions, evidence against shoe-
fitting X-rays has been positive
enough to anyone who has
made a point of reading the
published statements. The only
surprising thing about it is
that such a move should require
any “consideration.”
There are plenty of other
fields involving the use of
X-rays which could do with
some investigating as in
industrial plants, for instance.
And what about those regular
visits to the dentist which most
people make these days?
You’re almost certain to receive
two or three exposures at least
once a year in the dental chair
alone, and these, together with
rays of the chest and other
parts of the body, all add-up
to a sizeable dose in time.
As there can be no question
of banning in the medical field,
it seems that some scheme
should be introduced whereby
people are given a personal
record of X-ray exposures,
which could be retained and
produced when further ex-
posures are suggested. The
level of absorption could then
be readily ascertained at any
time. — Kemberry (A.C.T.).
Democratic Socialism
A.L.P. president F. E.
Chamberlain used almost all the
leader-page of a Sydney daily
to tell the public the meaning
of Democratic Socialism with-
out giving a single clue to its
methods and processes.
The sum of his effort was to
present a picture of the ideal
State that has been envisaged
by Socialist propagandists from
Edward Bellamy onwards.
The Socialist Utopia was a
common enough dream at the
beginning of the century, when
the three British exponents of
Socialism mentioned by Mr.
Chamberlain (Shaw, Wells and
William Morris) were at the
peak of their influence.
Attempts to practise
Socialism since then have
shown that the dream of a per-
fect Socialist State has no more
substance than the hallucina-
tions of opium-smokers.
Two Socialists, Hitler and
Mussolini, saw the potency of
the dream and turned it to their
own purposes to build societies
in which the State, represented
by themselves, held supreme
power. A third, Lenin, created
a Socialist State in Russia
which was the admiration of
Left-wing propagandists,
including those in the A.L.P.,
until its true nature became
obvious, even to them, after
World War 11.
It must be plain to all but
the most gullible that
Socialism leads not to a
promised land, but to the
growth of a powerful, mono-
polistic bureaucracy, and
culminates in inevitable
dictatorship.
In Russia Socialism did not
go wrong, as Mr. Chamberlain
suggests, but merely followed

its logical course to complete
suppression of the individual
and the creation of a dictatorial
clique.
If the A.L.P. wishes to play a
part in the government of Aus-
tralia its leaders should realise
that Socialism, far from being
a democratic process, is an out-
dated economic formula that
has been shown by experience
to lead only to dictatorship, the
negation of personal liberty and
actual slavery.
The problem of monopolistic
capitalism must be solved in
some other way —one that does
not merely substitute one type
of monopoly for another.
The leaders of the A.L.P.
would be wise to study closely
the anti-trust legislation of the
U.S.A. — Dick Turpin (N.S.W.).
Hospital Debts
The news that some country
hospitals are issuing summonses
to pull in outstanding fees
heralds a new era and a
welcome one at that.
For too long some public
hospitals have been notably
apathetic in collecting what was
owing to them. Once an
account was sent out, little or
nothing was done to see that
the cash came in. Systematic,
forceful follow-ups were
avoided ; it was just not done.
On odd occasions a reminder
might go forth, but, apologetic
in tone, it impelled only the
most sensitive to reply by
cheq ue.
As every businessman
knows, bad debts are the easiest
things to acquire. There are
hundreds of customers who
forget, or pretend to forget,
their debts if they are not
frequently thrust upon them,
and there are always the
avowed dodgers who hold out
until threatened with a
summons.
The very fact that sum-
monses going out from
hospitals is publicised as an
innovation denotes that, by
withholding such pressure in
the past, these institutions have
left hundreds of thousands of
pounds in the pockets of people
well able to pay.
The reluctance to hurt any-
one’s feelings by a too-insistent
demand for payment was, no
doubt, fostered and encouraged
by the certain knowledge that,
in the long run, the Govern-
ment would come to the r&cue
when the hospital got into a
financial mess. Collection of
fees was, therefore, not im-
portant—let those pay who felt
like it and those who did not,
well, why worry?
It may well be, as has been
reported, that the payment of
“There’s a time and place for everything, Rigney!"
!he Government subsidy, or
portion of it, is being made
conditional upon patients being
made to pay their bills. No
one will endorse this more than
the average taxpayer, who has
to shell-out to keep the hos-
pitals going. —J. Mcßon
(N.S.W.).
Rates
I couldn’t agree more with
“Kayell’s” complaint about
rates and taxes (B. 15/5/’57),
and I could add a lot more
regarding the shortcomings of
local councils. In our district
there are several busy thorough-
fares without footpaths. They
are a danger to old folk and
young children who are obliged
to walk along them, but our
council prefers to play round
with notions of baby-clinics
and public libraries —and this
in a municipality where the
average ratepayer can afford
to look after his own babies
and pay subscriptions to an
existing library if he wishes!
The half-acre on which our
house stands costs nearly £3
per week in council rates.
Around us owners are selling
as much of their land as they
are allowed, and where
formerly one house stood in
its attractive grounds you will
now find four two-storied
mansions huddled together.
Only last week a chap tried to
talk us into selling him some
of the backyard for £2OOO.
Ours is what used to be
called a “garden suburb.” A
few years ago a number of
properties boasted five acres of
grounds adorned with groves
of native and imported trees
and expanses of colorful
flowerbeds. No places of this
size remain and few are as
large as ours, yet it is suburbs
such as this which give beauty
and distinction to a city.
There are retired people up
our way (when they were
putting something on one side
for their declining years they
never dreamed they’d have to
find pounds a week for muni-
cipal rates) who have taken
and still take a pride in their
gardens and delight the eye of
the passer-by with their floral
displays. In a sense they are
public benefactors whose
efforts are appreciated by
visitors from other districts, if
one may judge by the crowds
who turn up in cars at various
times to view and exclaim
about the flowering-plums, the
red japonicas, and the rows of
15ft.-high azaleas to be seen
in our street.
If rates continue at their
present level (or become
higher), and if beautiful
gardens and gracious homes
are to be considered an asset
to a city, there is only one
thing to be done: rates must be
evened-up. Every property-
owner in the municipality must
be prepared to pay the same
amount of rates whether he
owns acres or a plot
with a 50ft.-frontage.— Maitri

<JS SSSSS
Norah Head
The” lighthouse at Norah Head, close to The Entrance; has
one of the tallest towers of any lighthouse on the New South
Wales seaboard. It is 77 ft. high, only three feet less than
the State's tallest lighthouse tower, which stands at Green
Cape on the far south coast.
However, in spite of the height of the Norah Head tower,
this light is by no means our highest. That distinction be-
longs to the Smoky Cape light, which is 420 ft. above high
water. In marked contrast, the flashing white light at
Norah Head is only 151 ft. above high water.
But Norah Head has another distinction. Established in
15)03, it is the newest lighthouse on the N.S.W. coast.
The original dioptric light (a dioptric light is one
strengthened by passing through a lens) at Norah Head was
of 438,000 candle power and the cost of building was nearly
£19,000. The £5,000 optical apparatus was of the type most
frequently used nowadays, the lens being carried on a mer-
cury float and the illuminant being vaporised kerosene. On
April 13, 1923, the light was strengthened to 700,000 candle
power and can now be seen 18 nautical miles.
Laymen often have difficulty in realising that the strength
of a light alone does not ensure it of a wide field of visibility.
For example, both the Cape Borda (W.A.) and the Fitzroy
Island (Q.) lights have less strength than the Norah Head
light, but are visible much further. The Cape Borda light,
with 608,000 candle power, can be seen 30 miles in good
weather and the Fitzroy Island light (350,000 candle power)
a distance of 28 miles.
Much depends on height above sea level, conditions of
visibility and whether both a reflector and a lens are used.
Some 10 wrecks have occurred in the area, one of the
most tragic being the steamer Gwydir in 1894, in which
three lives were lost. As a result of the wreck of the steamer
Nerong in 1917 three people died of exposure.
The position of the light is latitude 33° 17' south, longi-
tude 151" 35' east. Norah Head is 41 miles north of Sydney
by sea.

In the U.S.A. the Middle
West farmer grows black
walnut for the piano-factory by
sprouting the seed, planting it
out and husbanding it with
careful fencing, pruning and
weed-eradication at such times
as frozen ground prevents
ordinary farm activities. The
harvest cycle is 80 years and
the profit is sure and good.—

The Gorsedd
It was a bit disappointing to
learn that the Royal Arch
Druid so interested in folklore
(B. 1/5/’57) was not the Arch
Druid of Wales of Brittany,
but an office-bearer in a well-
known Friendly Society.
The other Arch Druids I
mention are two men who have
reached the absolute pinnacle
which most true Celts would
like to attain: they are the
leaders of the Gorsedd, an in-
stitution which exists for the
advancement of Celtic culture
• —in Wal£S it organises (among
other things) the great Welsh
National Eisteddfod and the
International Eisteddfod.
“Eisteddfod,” incidentally, sig-
nifies a “sitting of learned
men” and in its natural habitat
is far more than a mere musical
competition.
While national music plays
a big part in Gorsedd activi-
ties, a knowledge of a Celtic
language is a must- for those
who aspire to its membership,
for which regular examinations
are held. Its objects are purely
cultural and are not concerned
with national or home-rule
movements.
During the last war, Nazis in
occupied France offered self-
government for Brittany (the
Bretons have been fighting for
it for a long time) to the Arch
Druid there on condition that
the Bretons threw in their lot
with the apparently victorious
Axis Powers. The offer was
refused with scorn: the Ger-
mans were told (in effect) that
such a proposition could be
considered only when it came
from a properly-constituted
French Government.
Four members (bards) of the
Cornish Gorsedd are Austra-
lians. Two of them are regu-
lar contributors to The
Bulletin. —S. King (N.S.W.).
Pensioners
Many pensioners will be in
hearty agreement with Pro-
fessor R. I. Downing’s proposal
(B. 1/5/’57) that more money
be allowed for those who are
obliged to live alone. There’s
an anomaly somewhere when
some pensioners may own a
comfortable home and ride
about in their cars while others
lead a hand-to-mouth existence
in deplorable rooms in under-
privileged districts. Ministers
of religion and social-welfare
workers can testify to the
wretched conditions of the
latter class.
There is another type of
Australian sturdy, inde-
pendent—making no demands
in sickness and old age on the
“Welfare State,” and believing
(rightly or wrongly) in standing
on his own feet. Sooner than
accept monetary aid he makes-
do on less than £4 per week—
heaven alone knows how.
Should his bit of capital finally
dry up he feels like a criminal
when forced to apply for a
pension.
What' a pity a national-
insurance scheme was never
instituted, and why have our
Governments shied from the
idea? Pensions have come to
stay and will continue to eat
more and more of the national
income. National insurance
would have gone a long way to
provide the finance for them,
and from the psychological
point of view would have
re m ov e d any stigma of
“charity” which may be asso-
ciated with pensions today.
Those who have paid taxes
over many years, who are taxed
for social services and were
victims of heavy war-time
taxation need certainly not
apologise when they go after
a pension, but how much
more satisfactory it would be
from every point of view if all
who earned had contributed
to a national pension scheme.
Most of us will be with
Professor Downing in insisting
that if increases are to be made
in pensions they should be
handed-out to the lone wolf
living on his own. In some
households there are more than
two pensioners. If three people
making a home together have
each no more than £4 per week
coming in, it is still easier for
three (in such circumstances)
to live on a shared £l2 than it
is for one to manage on £4.
The setting-up of a national-
insurance scheme, however,
with the object of providing
adequate pensions for the aged
and infirm, should prove a
blessing both for future pen-
sioners and Government
Treasurers. — Maitri (N.S.W.).


THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
SYDNEY SHEEP SHOW AND SALES
TPHIS year’s Sheep Show was
held in the warmest
weather remembered for the
occasion—which diverted con-
versation from champions to
the impending drought in N. S.
Wales. “Impending” because,
except for some parts of the
south coast and southern table-
lands, and the colder mountain
districts, stock are not in bad
shape. In the far north-west
graziers say they could go
through to September without
rain, although that would be
the limit.
But among the Merino men
there was plenty of talk about
the wins by Sir Walter Merri-
man’s Merryville stud, despite
the fact that awards to the
famous Yass (N.S.W.) stud
have become pretty well a
feature of Sydney sheep shows
for a-number of years. But in
the past fine- and medium-wool
Merryville rams have won the
grand - championship. This
time, a Merryville strong-wool
ram took the coveted award.
He was very even, beautifully
If, as is claimed, the
descendants of a single

100 pounds of wool
in a year, the new

has not been intro-
duced too soon. The
treated wool has
no odour and the
handle, appearance
and physical or

are unchanged. De-
velopments directed
to the preservation of
wool are of vast
importance, as are
also developments
directed to the preser-
vation of young wool

Merjyville took the Stone-
haven Cup, the grand-
champion ram and ewe awards,
and the reserve grand-
champion ram prize. Other
championships to Merryville:

ewe ; fine-wool ram and ewe,
and reserves; medium-wool

ram; strong-wool ram and
ewe ; pen of five Merino ewes.
And, to round off a successful
show, Sir Walter’s grandson,
John Nadin, of Boorowa
(N.S.W.), won the senior
Merino-judging competition.
The reserve grand-champion
ewe was shown by A. Day and
Son, of Echo, Coolalie, Yass —
a stud founded on Merryville
blood.
Championship winners in all
breeds came from N. S. Wales,
Victoria, South Australia and
Tasmania.
The Eshcol stud of T. Starr
and Son, Dalton (N.S.W.), was
very successful in the open
section, winning the superfine-
wool ram and ewe champion-
ships and the champion and
reserve medium-wool ewe
awards against particularly
stiong competition.
In the medium-wool section,
the reserve-champion ram was
shown by consistent exhibitors
J. H. Reid and Son, from
Cooma (N.S.W.).
In the strong-wool section
the reserve-champion ram was
shown by new exhibitor T. H.
Williams, from Dubbo
(N.S.W.). Mr. Williams made
show-sale history on two
occasions by paying world-
record prices at auction for two
Bundemar rams in two con-
secutive years. The ram shown
was an outcome of the second
buy. ' s
The Billabong Pastoral Co.,
of Marsden (N.S.W.), exhibited
the reserve-champion strong-
wool ewe.
South Australian and far-
western and north-western
N.S.W. breeders shared honors
in the extra-strong-wool sec-
tion. The ram championship
was won by the well-known
S.A. breeder Murray Thomas,
the reserve award going to
Moxham Bros., of Murra-
wombie, Girilambone (N.S.W.)
—a stud founded on Koonoona
(S.A.) blood. The same stud
also exhibited the reserve-
champion extra - strong - wool
ewe.
Fred Colwell, of New
Prospect, near Walgett
(N.S.W.), who owns a small
stud, won the grand-champion
ewe award.
The Hazeldean Pastoral Co.,
of Cooma (N.S.W.), exhibited
the champion pen of five rams
against very strong competition.
Although they had been
shown before, this was the
first year Poll Merinos were
judged as a separate section.
Cameron and Co., of
Kalanga, Glen Innes
(N.S.W.), who exhibited in the
smallholders’ section, showed
the champion ram. Judge was
G. K. Simpson, of Goondiwindi
(Q-).
Novice Section
The Merino novice section
was very strong, with many
new exhibitors. A feature of
Sydney sheep shows in recent
years has been the support
given to the novice and small-
graziers’ sections.
The champion ram of the
novice section was the fine-
wool champion, exhibited by
C. K. Gorham, of Willowmere,
Boorowa (N.S.W.), James
Ferguson, of Fairfield Grange,
Trangie (N.S.W.), showed the
reserve ram, and Fred Colwell,
Walgett (N.S.W.), the novice
ewe. Reserve novice ewe was
shown by M. D. Armstrong, of
Tulangi, Boorowa.
Other championship winners
in the novice section were M. J.
Hoadley, of Waverleigh Park,
Berry (N.S.W.); Billabong
Pastoral Co.; Mundadoo
Pastoral Co., Girilambone
(N.S.W.); J. W. and R. J.
Wilson, Berlang stud, Balla-
doran (N.S.W.), and J. A.
Parmenter and Sons,
Wyyvelloe, Ganmain (N.S.W.).
Small Graziers
A. Day and Son, exhibitors
of the reserve grand-champion
ewe, were the most consistent
winners in the small graziers’
section. They took the follow-
ing awards: Superfine- and
reserve superfine-wool ewes, the
fine-wool and reserve fine-wool
ewes, fine-wool and reserve fine-
wool rams, and the medium-
wool and reserve medium-wool
ewes.
T. R. Hazell, Valrosa,
Boorowa (N.S.W.), were
multiple winners, taking the
fine-wool and reserve fine-wool
ram awards and the superfine-
wool ram prize.
Cox Bros., of Bocomble,
Mudgee (N.S.W.), exhibited the
reserve superfine-wool ram.
Neil McDonald, of Bull-
away, Coonabarabran (N.S.W.),
won the reserve strong-wool
ram and the strong-wool ewe
prizes. Fred Colwell, of
Walgett, showed the reserve
strong-wool ewe. R. J. Bell
and Son, of Corona, Gilgandra
(N.S.W.), exhibited the strong-
wool ram.
Junior Farmers
The junior-farmers classes
were the strongest they have
ever been. The quality sur-
prised and pleased the judge,
Aubrey Cantrill, of the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture.
The champion ewe was
shown by Miss E. McCormack,
of Bellview, Cooma (N.S.W.).
The reserve ewe was shown by
M. Moran, of Mountain View,
Bribbaree (N.S.W.).
Fleeces
Merryville Pty., Ltd., exhibited
the grand-champion and
reserve grand-champion fleeces
of the show. In the Corriedale


WHAT WILL YOUR
WOOL CLIP BRING?
Woo! Prices Today Are Higher Than They
Have Been Since June, 1954
NO ONE KNOWS HOW LONG THEY WILL LAST
However, it is now possible for a grazier to insure his clip for a figure very near today’s values up to 18
months ahead. (It varies from within 2\ per cent, to 10 per cent., depending when the clip is due for
auction.)
This arrangement does not interfere in any way with the normal selling of the wool here in
Australia through the regular selling brokers.
This insurance is carried out by selling contracts (or promissory notes) on the London Wool Futures
Market to the approximate value of the clip. One contract represents about 35 bales of greasy wool.
These contracts are bought back the day the clip is sold at auction.
It does enable a grazier to budget for the running of his property with security.
The price of wool and the price of futures move together, so that when wool values are high, future values
are high—and vice versa.
If you are interested in protecting
all or part of your clip AGAINST
A FALL IN VALUES, please
fill in and mail the accompanying
coupon and we will advise you for
what amount your clip can be
insured whilst it is awaiting its turn

Carroll Pty., Ltd., Trangie
(N.S.W.), while C. E. and H. F.
Prell, of Gundowringa, Crook-
well (N.S.W.), exhibited the
champion fleeces for ram and
ewe in the unhoused classes.
The wool section was the best
yet.
Corriedales and Polwarths
Record entries kept the
Corriedale judges busy. The
ram championship went to a
Victorian entry from the Stan-
bury stud of R. E. Wettenhall,
Ceres, and the reserve ram
prize to C. E. and H. F. Prell.
The Charles Carroll stud
exhibited the champion ewe,
and J. B. Macfarlane and Sons,
Eurella, Cudal (N.S.W.), the
reserve-champion ewe.
The ram and ewe champion-
ships in the Polwarth section
were won by H. J. McDonald,
of Glenwood, Dubbo (N.S.W.),
and both reserves by A. E.
Coote, Manilla (N.S.W.). All
the entries were polls.
British Breeds
R. M. Mendham, of Teasdale
Park, Barry, via Blayney
(N.S.W.), scooped the pool in
the Romney Marsh section,
winning all the championships
and reserve - championships.
The ewe was grand-champion
for the third time. Entries, at
107, were a record.
Victorians dominated the
largest Border Leicester section
seen in Sydney. The Kelso stud
of G. Starritt and Son, North
West Mooroopna (Vic.), won
the ram and reserve-ewe
championships, while G. F. E,
Hosking and Sons, of Kerang
(Vic.), showed the' reserve ram.
The champion Border Leicester
ewe was shown by Kennedy
and Sproat, of Darling Point,
Sydney. She was an imported
ewe.
Judge of the section was R.
Bratton, of Glen Vista, West-
bury (Tas.). The judging con-
tinued well into the second
day.
T. V. Brunskill and Sons, of
Inglewood and Forest Hill,
Wagga (N.S.W.), veteran
Southdown breeders, had a
field-day with their entries.
They won the Southdown ram-
championship and the
champion and reserve-
champion ewe awards.
D. R. Peden, of Glenelg,
Goulburn (N.S.W.), showed the
reserve-champion ram.
The judge, R. T. Carter, of
Narromine (N.S.W.), was
particularly pleased with the
quality of the section.
The Dorset Horn section
provided, in the opinion of
keen observers, the best exhibit
of the breed seen anywhere in
Australia The judge was A. E.
Day, of Allendale, Alma (S.A.).
Grand-champion ram was
shown by A. Taylor, of Linds-
bury, Cudal (N.S.W.), while
Marylebone Pty., Ltd., Maryle-
bone, Cudal, won the awards
for reserve ram and the ewe
and reserve-ewe championships,
taking the prize for the most
successful exhibitor. Newbold
Pty., Ltd., the South Australian
parent-stud, didn't exhibit this
year.
The Ry eland section was
smaller, with Mrs. Ken Hicks,
of Orange (N.S.W.), winning
the ram, reserve-ram, and ewe
championships. H. F. Worth-
ington, of Prior Park, Dromana
(Vic.), showed the reserve-
champion ewe.
In the small Suffolk section,
Mrs. W. R. Johnson, of
Cronulla (N.S.W.), showed the
champion ram, while V. H.
Heffernan, of Bimbaya
(N.S.W.), exhibited the reserve-
ram and the reserve-ewe
champions. A. McG. Sproat,
of Darling Pt., Sydney, showed
the champion Suffolk ewe.
Cheviot championships were
well divided. A. and S. Cassidy,
of Murchison East (Vic.),
showed the champion ram, and
Tasmanian exhibitor I. C.
Heazlewood, of Melton Vale,
Whitemore, the reserve ram.
J. Lyne, of Eskdale, Pow-
ranna (Tas.), won the ewe
championship, and Fogarty and
Blackwell, Dunalister stud,
Oaklands Junction (Vic.), the
reserve-ewe award.
The Sales
Highlight of the three-day
Merino sales was the knocking-
down of a Uardry Poll Merino
ram to the F. S. Falkiper con-
cern for 5000gns.—a world-
record price for a Poll Merino.
Both Uardry and the studs con-
trolled by the F. S. Falkiner
company derive directly from
the Peppin flocks, and are
among the great Riverina
parent-studs, and Poll Merinos
originated on one of these F. S.
Falkiner properties, Boonoke.
The sale is particularly interest-
ing because Uardry’s manager
says his stud is going out of
polls.
Generally speaking, the
demand for good-quality rams
was as strong this year as at any
time. Although fewer rams
may have been sold, the
average price for those sold was
higher than last year.
In other words Sydney is not
—and was never meant to be —■
a flock-ram market.
On the first day the market
was erratic, on the second
firmer than anyone had the
right to expect, and prices on
the third and last day
demonstrated the confidence of
breeders in the future of the
industry.
Top price on Monday was
3600gns. for a Uardry ram.
Previously, Bundemar had sold
a ram for 2900gns. to T.
Williams, who had twice
bought the top-priced ram (by
world standards) from
Bundemar.
On the second day of the
sales the Haddon Rig offer-
ing sold, as usual, very well
indeed. Rams went to
4500gn5., with the wide spread
of Haddon Rig influence
becoming obvious as the sale
progressed.
E. Smith, of Perth, bought
one at 3300gns. and another
at 1200gns., the Lolleep stud
of T. J. Dugan and Sons,
Walgett, N.S.W., bought one
(their third high-priced ram
in three years) for 3900gn5.,

Other Breeds
R. E. Wettenhall, of Stan-
bury (Vic.), was paid top-price
of 400gns. for a Corriedale
ram bought by S. R. Jarvis
and Sons, 'Heathf i e l d ,
Boorowa (N.S.W.). Second-
top-price for a Corriedale also
went to Wettenhall. The price
was 210gns., paid by L.
Thomas, of Guyra (N.S.W.).
Top-price for a New South
Wales stud was 170gns. for
M. Carroll and Sons, of Red-
bank, Molong (N.S.W.).
Both the Corriedale and
British-breed sales were again
proof that nothing but top-
notch rams should be offered.
The fat-lamb breed rams
have to be held so long that
the sale loses its impetus due
to this fact.
Top Border Leicester sale
was made by the parent-stud,
Kelso —525gns.
Top Border price
for a ewe was 275gn5., for
Kennedy and Sproat’s
champion ewe.
Best Dorset Horn price was

W. and E. Roberts Thomson,
Wynyard (Tas.). Highest
price for a Southdown was

first time, made to 310gns. for

THE RINGER.
New Seed-drill
“Myall”: Albert Fuss, of
Uralla, near Dalby (Q.), has
invented a new type of seed-
drill that might revolutionise
the sowing of crops on the
Darling Downs. The machine
is attached to a 20ft. chisel-
plough, and this enables the
seed to be sown through
stubble, thus combating soil-
erosion.
The seed is delivered from
the bin to a spinning plate
which separates any clusters
of grain and sends it with
centrifugal force to the walls
of a drum, from which the
hose-outlets radiate. Fans drive
the grain through the hoses by
air-pressure. With the 20ft.
chisel-plough, the seed must be
carried 10ft. to the outside
tynes, but the mechanism is
capable of forcing the grain to
a much greater distance. Special
“boots” have been made by
the inventor to place the seed
in the most suitable point for
germination, and standard
chisel-points are used without
sweeps.
The grain is fed to the centri-
fuge through an auger that can
“Just belly-cut an back-cut, mug !”
handle any type of seed. The
speed of the auger is regulated
by a series of “stepped” V-
pulleys capable of delivering
any seed at a given rate, from
61b. of canary-seed to 601 b. of
wheat to the acre. The machine
is powered by a |-h.p. motor,
but may be connected to a
power-take-off or a ground-
drive with equally satisfactory
results.
The tyne-spacing is Ift.
instead of the usual 7in. in the
ctpnHprrf (-01X16106. and this will
suit Downs conditions better.
Mr. Fuss has long contended
that this closer spacing was
not suitable for the heavy,
black soils of the Downs ; he
says that the greater distance
between tynes won’t affect the
yield adversely, as the crop will
stool better and give more
grain per plant.
Sheep-rugs
“Valentine”: Sheep - rugs,
used mainly for show animals
in Australia, show signs of
a comeback in United States
commercial flocks. There have
been experiments in Wyoming
with plastic-treated burlap and
raincoating, and with resin-
coated' cotton. The new
materials are lighter than those
used in earlier rugs, and more
resistant to the wear-and-tear
of rocks and bushes.
In certain districts, and with
small flocks, something of the
kind might be done here.
Although, of course, the
economics of the scheme would
have to be worked out pretty
thoroughly first.
Besides keeping out dust and
vegetable-matter—which cost a
lot —the rugs could protect the
sheep from such conditions as
lumpy-wool and fleece-rot.
Previous experiments have
shown that rugged sheep
produce longer staples of wool
than those without rugs.
Farm Hints
“Big Billy”: A good ferti-
liser for the home-garden can
be made from 2\ parts sul-
phate-of-ammonia, parts of
super., and one part of
sulphate-of-potash. Generally,
this should be applied at 2oz.
to 4oz. to the sq. yd., according
to soil-fertility. Mix manure
into the top few inches of soil
before doing any planting-out.
“Jake”: Don’t allow
broodies to occupy layers’
nests. The latter often have
to fight a losing battle for a
comfortable position to lay,
resulting in broken eggs. Some
hens go regularly to the same
nest, and will drop the egg in
the open if the nest is occupied
when they are ready to lay.
Best plan is to separate the
broodies from the rest of the
fowls.


Women's Letters
MELBOURNE
For the Queen’s Birthday reception at
Government House Lady Slim wore a
lovely gown of soft mist-blue Chantilly-
lace with a very wide skirt, a heart-
shaped neckline and lace shoulder-straps,
and with diamond-necklace, -brooch and
-tiara added. Lady Herring’s smoke-
blue satin gown had an overskirt of
matching tulle. The skirt of Mrs. Henry
Bolte’s gown of pink ruched organza had
loops of pink satin which matched her
satin stole. Lady McMullin's gown was
of pink-and-grey brocade. The Lady
Mayoress, Lady Selleck, wore creamy
satin embroidered with topaz and gold.
Others noted at the reception were U.S.
Ambassador W. J. Sebald and Mrs.
Sebald; the Ewart Chappies; Mr. and
Mrs. Kurt Woess ; Sir Sydney and Lady
Rowell; Italian Minister Silvio Daneo
and his wife, and the Marchesa Serafini;
U.S. Consul-General Gerald Warner and
Mrs. Warner ; U.K. High Commissioner
Lord Carrington and Lady Carrington
(whose gown of oyster satin had
a cuff of eau-de-Nil satin on the strap-
less bodice); Mrs. Dolly Guy Smith
(wearing pink lace and tulle), and her
son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs.
Michael Keeble.
At the second reception held at the
Town Hall in honor of the Governor-
General and Lady Slim many beautiful
gowns were worn. Lady Slim’s, strapless
and with a voluminous skirt, was of white
paper-taffeta and featured a diamente-
embroidered cummerbund-waist.
Pale-orchid-pink satin, embroidered
richly on bodice and skirt, was the choice
of Lady Selleck. Lady Copland wore
embroidered bronze satin, Mrs. James
McGauran a wide-skirted gown of white
French-brocade threaded and em-
broidered with gold. Mrs. Richard
Buxton wore filmy black tulles ; Margot
Evans a short bouffant frock of peacock-
blue silk-shantung; her sister Mary white
chiffons ; Mrs. Ronald Evans, a simple
short frock of black velvet. Mrs. Douglas
Cox wore a red Italian-brocade, Mrs.
Harry Lee blue-and-silver brocade, and
Mrs. John Williams pale-pink satin.

The huge crowd which waited for hours
outside Her Majesty’s Theatre on the
opening night of the Dame Margot
Fonteyn ballet was amply repaid for its
patience, for the array of glamorous
gowns, jewels 'and furs was quite breath-
taking.
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
(Cr. Sir Frank and Lady Selleck) arrived
just before the Governor-General and
Lady Slim. The vice-regal couple were
met by Sir Frank Tait and Lady Tait,
with other directors of J. C. Williamson.
Lady Slim’s black velvet gown had the
wide-neckline emphasised by a diamond-
pendant; the skirt’s fullness finished in a
short train.
Geranium-red chiffon was Mrs. Bolte’s
choice, and Lady Selleck wore pearl-
tinted duchesse-satin embroidered in gold
and taupe and cut on Empire-lines, with
a drapery of taupe satin emphasising the
line and finishing at the back.
Lord and Lady Carrington were also
in the official party, she wearing a grace-
ful gown of aqua-green chiffon, high-
lighted with a lighter-green panel. Lady
Tait's choice was a gown of white
duchesse-satin richly embroidered on
bodice ,and skirt with pearls and
brilliants ; her wide matching-satin stole
was also embroidered.
Mrs. Ronald Nott’s swathed tea-rose-
pink gown was a Jean Desses creation.
Mrs. Leonard Buxton wore a Balenciaga
of greige satin, the heavily-oeaded yoke
of forming the tiny sleeves
of the boiiice ; the voluminous skirt had
a peacock hem. From Christian Dior
came Mrs. George Weir’s gown of
bronze-romaine; the draperies on the
skirt were longer than the skirt itself. A
most striking gown was that worn by Mrs.
Dorothy Gitsham. Of white pure-silk
jersey, it was swathed to the figure in the
Grecian manner, and this classical line
was emphasised by the drape, which fell
softly irom me waist to me hemline in
front.
Mrs. Sidney Baillieu Myer, O.B.E., has
a long record of service to the community.
A member of the board of management
A Royal Melbourne Hospital, she has
worked for that institution for 25 years,
and has also served Red Cross in many
capacities. It was her husband who laid
the foundation of the Myer Emporium,
now directed by her sons Kenneth and
Baillieu. While the Governor-General
and Lady Slim are in Melbourne their
official residence is Cranlana, the Toorak
home of Mrs. Baiilieu Myer.
The flower-decorated reception-room
at the Town Hall had a full complement
of guests when the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress gave a reception for the
stars of the Borovansky ballet. Dame
Margot Fonteyn wore a striking Dior
ensemble: a coat of black stiffened
corded-faille with the collar and tuxedo-
fronts finished with natural mink. With
it she wore a tiny pillbox-hat of taupe
melusine. A waisted coat of black-velvet
and a Juliet cap of oyster satin sprinkled
with diamente were the choice of Rowena
Jackson. Lady Selleck's frock Of black
silk taffeta had a full-ruched skirt; with
it went a liny curvelte of black velvet
and a sapphire-blue mink-stole. Mrs.

CANBERRA
In ideal weather, the Queen's Birthday
was celebrated with a ceremonial-parade
and Trooping the Color at the Royal
Military College, Duntroon. The parade-
ground, surrounded by bright red-berry
hedges, was a colorful setting for the
impressive ceremony. Minister for the
Army J. O. Cramer took the salute and
inspected the parade.
Guests were later entertained at morn-
ing-tea by the Commandant R.M.C.,


Major-General Wilton, and staff in the
gardens of Duntroon House.
Among those noted were the Com-
mandant’s wife, smart in a dove-blue
suit and grey-feathered toque ; the High
Commissioner for New Zealand and Mrs.
Aiderton, she wearing a sage-green suit
and biscuit felt hat; Colonel and Mrs. D.
Daunt; Major John Stubbs, and his
attractive wife (who wore a beige tweed
suit trimmed with mushroom velvet and
matching beret) ; Group-Captain Steege
and his wife (she in a black slim-skirted
suit) ; Mr. and Mrs. P. S. McGovern ;
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. McLaren ; Dr. and
Mrs. R. Hoy ; and Major John Paley,
of the British Army.
Noted also that a thoroughfare in the
heart of the college has been named lan
Campbell-road, in honor of the recently-
retired Commandant, Major-General lan
Campbell.
SYDNEY
It has been quite a busy week with
the social season in full swing. Conver-
sation has flitted around the promised
breaking of the droughrt and the unusual
sight of rain in the city ; how pleased
everyone was to hear that Dame Anna-
belle Rankin has been included in the
Queen’s Birthday honors ; how few flags
were put out for that birthday-celebra-
tion (you could count those in George-
street on one hand); the A.L.P.’s sanction
for the Opera House ; and the threatened
’flu from the East.

Dances have followed close on one
another during the week. At the Legacy
Ball at the Trocadero 22 debutantes made
their bow to the Governor, Sir John
Northcott, the matron-of-honor being
Mrs. F. B. McAllister. At the Gunner
Ball, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir
Kenneth Street, was guest-of-honor. The
patron of the Royal Australian Artillery
Association, Sir Frank Berryman, was
present with Lady Berryman, and ball-
committee president Brigadier Jock Pagan
welcomed the guests with Mrs. Pagan.
At Prince’s 300 merrymakers arrived for
the Bachelors’ Ball, which is in aid of
Torchbearers for Legacy. President of
this committee is Phillip Simpson, while
Mrs. Bill Murrell is the committee’s
guide, friend and court-of-last-appeal.

The Mater Misericordiae Ball held at
the Trocadero was perhaps the most
spectacular of the week. The foyer was
decorated with huge, brilliantly colored
caricatures of medical life (very modern
in line) and the tables were all cleverly
decorated. Mrs. Paul Nelson’s table, with
a 20in. doll dressed as a Sister-of-Mercy,
was one of the most attractive, while Dr.
Bob Mclnerney’s table, set-up like a sur-
gery, was amusing, if rather macabre.
Mrs. Mclnerney, by the way, won the
prize for the most beautiful gown with
her white organdie banded in black
guipure-lace. The chairman of the Mater
board, Mr. Justice J. H. McClemens, and
Mrs. Tom Bateman, president of the
ball-committee, welcomed the Governor,
Sir John Northcott. Mrs. Bateman’s dress
was silver-embroidered white nylon
covered by a scarlet taffeta full-length
coat. About 900 attended.
Toni Lamond, who plays the leading
role in the lively musical show “The
Pyjama Game’’ at the Empire, is the
daughter of a theatrical family, and made
her debut at the age of 10 singing and
playing parts in radio-plays. She
appeared as leading lady to Tommy
Trinder for two years and has appeared
in TV with the Johnny O’Connor Show.
In “The Pyjama Game ” she plays the role
that Sydney's Joy Nicholls played in
London.
Country visitors for Wool Week were
among the guests at the party given by
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Barnham, of Rose-
ville Chase, to announce the engagement
of their daughter Elizabeth-Anne to Lewis
Alan Bell, of Gundaline, Hay. Elizabeth-
Anne wore for the party black velvet
trimmed with black, rhinestone-studded
guipure-lace. Her ring is a lovely
solitaire-diamond. She and her fiance,
who is the son of the late Alan Bell, of
Alma, Booligal, and Mrs. Janet Bell, of
Toorak, Melbourne, plan to marry early
next year.

The first literary luncheon arranged by
the N.S.W. Society for Crippled
Children was a great success. The
speaker, Paul Rogers (though engaged
during the week in the two gruelling tasks
of fighting the ’flu and playing Hamlet),
gave a brilliant virtuoso display of enter-
taining an audience on a subject (Restora-
tion Drama) of which he claimed to know
nothing. Saw there Mrs. James Dixon
(who was Prudence Vanbrugh and, of
course, had much to talk of to the guest-
speaker), Mrs. Greg Kater, Mrs. Gregory
Blaxland, Mrs. Dundas Allen, Mrs.
Malcolm Fuller and Miss Marisa Martelli.
July 1 is a date to remember for all
Red Cross supporters who will be in
Sydney at that time for the Miss Tea-
house of the August Moon Ball. The
many prizes include a lovely fur, a baum-
marten necklet, donated by Mrs. Max
Cornelius for the midnight Cinderella
Spot Dance. As guests enter they will be
handed lucky-numbers in exchange for
their tickets ; the numbers to be drawn by
stars of “The Pyjama Game.” At mid-
night guests will dance beneath a drift of
cherry-blossom as thousands of pink and
white blooms are released.

An interesting visitor during the week
was the Hon. Mrs. Trevor Rose, whose
sister, the Hon. Mrs. Leslie Gamage, was
known to many of our R.A.A.F. for her
hospitality during war-time. Mrs. Rose
is the daughter of the late Lord Hirst,
and is paying a visit to her sister, Mrs.
Edward Hirst, of Burraburoo, Gulgong.
A member of the London County
Council, she said that women made up
one-third of the councillors in London,
which certainly makes the Australian
scene appear very backward.


anxious to give the impression
abroad that there were hardly
any Russian soldiers left in the
country.
Budapest, especially in the
months before the revolution,
had a considerable tourist-
traffic, and the Reds were eager
to prove that Communism in
Hungary was able to stand on
its own feet. But now the
pretence was cast aside;
Russian armor poured into the
capital.
T OVAS, the onlooker, was
still convinced that the
uprising would be quickly
quelled with the help of the
Russians, and then ... the
terrible retribution. He was
unable to imagine a spon-
taneous movement, unarmed
and unled, spreading from one
workers’ district to another,
then right through the country,
and gaining the peasants'
support.
What made Gyula Lovas
such a sceptic, almost afraid
that a change might come for
the better? His personal back-
ground made him a natural
enemy of the Communist
regime—a lawyer, an officer in
the “former Army”—his past
achievements qualified him as
no more than a street-sweeper.
But he had energy and a
will to live. When he realised
that the practice of law was
not only a farce but an im-
possibility for him under the
Communists, he sought a pro-
fession the regime needed. It
never occurred to him to
migrate; he was born a
Hungarian and intended to
stay in his country. So he chose
accountancy.
Chartered accountants were
eagerly sought by the Com-
munists. In capitalist countries
balance-sheets are important ;
in the Communist States they
are often a matter of life or
death. Figures must always
prove that the “planners” are
right ; for this reason the Reds
even preferred outsiders, who
could have no political axes to
grind.
An indifferent Indispensable
had a good chance of dying
a natural death, even if he
attained a high and responsible
position. Lovas worked as an
auditor for smaller State-enter-
prises, and then at the Ministry
of Agriculture, in the planning-
section.
He made rapid progress. The
bosses liked him despite his
“dubious past.” Some of the
more naive, who didn’t know
the advantage of employing
outsiders, even made overtures
to him to join the Party. He
declined with an apologetic
smile.
At the Ministry of Agri-
culture, just as at other State
enterprises, the staff was strictly
divided between “workers” and
“politicians.”
The politicians were in a
majority, issuing directives to
the experts, who did the work.
Former bootmakers, drivers
and navvies were section-chiefs,
directors. Some of the better-
educated who could read and
write and had good memories
freely quoted from the books
of Marx, Lenin and Stalin,
and pressed the experts to put
into practice the economic
theories of their idols. Whether
or not they were applicable
to Hungarian conditions, all
Russian economic, industrial
and agricultural trends were
religiously followed.
AT times it seemed to Lovas
that the system was bent
on destroying itself. A good
party-man, a former sanitary-
cleaner, might manage to
acquire some knowledge as the
director of an iron-foundry.
Sooner or later he would get
a posting to some other
industry he knew nothing
about. Yet the more ignorant
a section - chief was the
more he demanded absolute
obedience and the carrying-out
of all instructions to the letter.
The “working ants,” as
Lovas and the other toilers
called themselves, completed
their tasks without protest, and
often with bitter enthusiasm.
While party-members were
moved from one place to
another, the experts had to
remain at their designated
places of work indefinitely.
They must not even con-
template leaving a job.
I could get out of here only
if the police took me away,
Lovas thought when he was
fed-up with the stupid orders
he had to execute.
A degree of intimacy
developed amongst the experts,
who gradually sorted - out
informers from those to whom
they could confide their real
thoughts or jokes at the
expense of the regime.
For the Budapesters, despite
regimentation and political
terror, did not lose their sense
of humor. Secret listeners to
Radio Europe and other
Western broadcasters, they
heard about America’s
hundred - million - dollar pro-
gramme to aid refugees from
Iron Curtain countries. Occa-
sionally when a section-chief
made a particularly costly
blunder, the experts whispered
to each other: “For this,
President Eisenhower would
decide on a further grant —if
only he knew about it.”
Yet it was soul-killing to take
part in the destruction of
Hungary’s three - million
peasants. Some of the experts
suspected that it was not the
Government’s ignorance and
stupidity that was destroying
the country’s agriculture, but its
cunningly-devised plan to do
away with the peasant-class,
which had proved so formid-
able an enemy to Communism.
Before the war Hungarian
agriculture was world-famed ;
now it was On the verge of
bankruptcy. Stock - breeding
plans, for instance, which often
required years to become
effective, were changed from
one month to another. Quotas
for the sowing and delivery of
cereals were often in crazy
contradiction.
Working - out directives,
checking, declaring blunders to
be good results, increased the
dilemma of the “working ants.”
Certainly inefficiency was
bound to harm the regime ; but
it also harmed the peasantry,
and caused hunger among the
urban population. In 1949
Hungary had been slowly
recovering from the war.
There were even signs of
prosperity in the country. In
that short-lived period of
promise and relative freedom
individual talent could still do
its best. But the Communists,
coming into full power in
1949, resented people with
vision and ability.
“There must be only a
collective effort,” they repeated
time and again. Talent was not
only suppressed but persecuted.
Talent was replaced with laws,
regulations expressed in
innumerable paragraphs. The
Communists talked about “the
raising of living-standards.”
The people at first listened to
them, but the statements be-
came empty phrases ; hunger
and cold accentuated the farce.
Propaganda - articles ridicul-
ing the “crisis of overproduc-
tion in America” had an
opposite effect. Lovas and his
friends interpreted the
“Western problems” as signs of
wonderful prosperity.
Before the war food had
been plentiful in Hungary;
there was even overproduction.
The earth was the same, the
climate did not change, the
peasant’s ability to grow and
multiply his crop was still there,
centuries of experience, coupled
with modern science, could
have filled the bellies of the
millions. . . But Engels said. . .
Marx thought . . . and Lenin
was of the opinion . . . Besides,
the latest Soviet methods. . .
T>Y 1953 even the Communists
realised that the country
was heading towards complete
disaster. Imre Nagy, a Moscow-
trained “liberal,” was called in
to save the situation.
Nagy tried to give indi-
vidualism back to the people.
He was accused of Titoism,
and put out of the way. Once
more the “working ants” had
to suppress all thoughts of
improvement and sane action,
and do their jobs as directed.
Imagine day by day execut-
ing orders against your better
judgment. Refuse the orders?
What good would that do?
Someone else was certain to
take your place behind the
shabby desk. This was how
Gyula Lovas existed. Often he
wished he had taken up the
challenge, and not let himself
be mentally liquidated.
But there was Paula, Tamas
and the fiat. . .
For five years Gyula Lovas
toiled like an automaton ; and
in his happier moments, when
he tried to condition himself
to compromise, he felt like
one. 11l or healthy, defiant or
meek, he appeared in his office
at eight every morning.
And now he had to face a
momentous decision. Walking
the streets, searching for his
father, he was confronted by
a youth who put a leaflet in
his hand:
October 24, Wednesday, is a
Day of General Strike. Don't
go to your Place of Work.
Remain on the People’s Side.
He read • the leaflet, then
looked at his watch. It was


already past eleven. His holi-
day over, he should have been
at the Ministry three hours
before.
T OVAS’S first impulse was to
' hurry to the Ministry and
make excuses to his section-
chief. He couldn’t rid himself
of the feeling that the uprising
would last no longer than a few
more hours.
Here was a police-State,
with a highly efficient and ruth-
less secret-service, fully backed
by powerful Soviet forces.
Never since the system had
been established had it toler-
ated deviation. Lovas thought
of his own kith and kin,
who, at one time or another,
languished in the prisons
controlled by the Avos. What
had they done to deserve the
softening-process which had
made them different, and so
often obedient tools of the
Reds ?
Unguarded words whispered
into wrong ears ... Jail or
banishment, or even execution.
And now thousands of men,
women, and even children,
reached for weapons, turning
against the regime in open
violence.
Lovas looked at the busy
streets and saw the young
revolutionaries, many of them
mere children, armed as best
they could be, patriotism
burning in their eyes, fearless
and freezing, brave and
hungry. He felt like crying.
For these selfless teenagers
there would be a Red day of
reckoning.
But vengeance would go
deeper than death or the death
of age-groups. It would seek
out those who were “indirectly
iesponsible”—the old teacher,
who was sound asleep, miles
away, whilst his pupils fought
in Brody Sandor-street trying to
capture Radio Budapest; the
factory-foreman; the parents.
He thought of his son,
Tarnas, nine, too young to be
placed among the youth who
would have to carry the burden
of “collective responsibility,”
never to be trusted, nor given
good'"positions as long as the
Communists remained in
power.
Slowly an enormous fear
spread through Lovas’s mind.
It did not concern him person-
ally, nor his family, but the
young people, unable to realise
the consequences of their
actions. Compared with the
unfolding tragedy of these
politically innocent youths, his
own personal safety, the well-
being of his family—and the
flat! —hardly mattered.
This anxiety remained with
Lovas right through the
revolution. It made him feel
that he should rush to their
help, but he had gone through
a lot during the war and its
aftermath, learning how fool-
hardy it was to fight against
overwhelming odds.
Yet there \yere the in-
vocations on the walls of
houses, the upturned and burnt-
out amored cars, the crowd’s
loud demands :
“Out with the Russkis !
Death to Gerd! Freedom and
real equality! ”
The whispers formerly
suppressed within the safety
of homes increased in volume,
burst the walls of intimidation
and loudly reverberated in the
open, rising to a united
crescendo.
A group of singing and shout-
ing people enveloped Lovas,
and carried him along the
street.
“Down with Gero ! Death
to the Avos ! Out with the
Russkis!” they yelled in
unison.
Lovas heard his own voice
crying with the crowd.
He stopped in the middle of
the human current. Let the
others pass and leave him
behind. It was getting dark.
It was useless to search the
faces of the dead and wounded,
to look at the roughly-hewn
wooden crosses in public
gardens so quickly turned into
cemeteries. His child and wife
awaited him. Paula must be
frantic by now, wondering what
had happened to him. He must
go home to his family.

change the more they are the same
thing. But Miss Webster, a daughter
of Dame May Whitty, has had con-
siderable experience of putting
Shakspeare on in New York, and has
travelled him 60,000 miles through the
States, and thus brings the utmost
practicality to her discussions of how
the plays should be presented for their
best effect upon modern audiences.
Play by play for the full repertoire,
she makes her points, how demonstra-
tive passion is precluded from all
Shakspeare’s love-scenes because the
women were played by boys; that
“Lear,” “the greatest of Shakspeare’s
dramatic poems,” can never be
adequately acted ; that no actress can
ever be swift enough for Beatrice’s
repartee ; that Dogberry and Verges
are being misrepresented if they are not
played seriously, but for laughs ...
For anyone producing Shakspeare it
should be a most valuable companion;
and it is highly approved in an intro-
duction by none less than M. R.

Temple” Shakspeare.
Report on Repertory
The most engaging features of Julia
James’s Mother Signed the Contract
(Peter Davies), an account of how she
broke into show-business in England,
are its freshness and the intimate
picture it gives of the various forms
of repertory theatre with which the
English countryside apparently bristles.
The funniest company she joined in
her first year was called a “Fit-up”:
it played a different show every
night. There was no script—the
actors just waited until there was a
pause and then said something that
they thought would help the plot along.
Cues were given thus: “I think I see
Ann approaching,” and Ann would
know that she should be there; or,
“Hadn’t you better go indoors, Ann?”
(or outdoors as the case may be) when
she had stayed on too long. One thing
the 18-year-old Julia gained from this
experience was the certainty that she
would never again dry-up completely
on the stage!
Julia James, who is Australian-
born, the daughter of author Florence
James, reveals herself as a person of
method and determination in her
efforts to enter a profession in which
80 per cent, of its members are
unemployed. She advertises, has photo-
graphs printed, sends off 87 letters in
the first three weeks, is willing to
go anywhere, do anything (except
“posing,” which turned out to be
appearing in a fairground booth
“wearing nothing but fig-leaves and
balloons in strategic places”), and
learns all she can from her friends’
outpouring on how they got their jobs.
In consequence, she can report at
first-hand on companies that played a
new play each week, those that put on
two a night, on pantomime, on theatre
in-the-round, on club-theatre “for art’s
sake” and meals, and on a “Special
Week at Harrow,” from which she
graduated to a part in a West End play,
for which her mother signed the

A lively book, which should interest
other young Australians with similar
ambitions.
A Dingo Book
Henry G. Lamond has written a
book about a stallion, a book about
a kangaroo, a book about a bull and
a book about a sheep-dog, and now,
by jingo, he has written Dingo.
A reader unfamiliar with the
nrpvioiiQ hnnkc nnd nartirnlarlv an
previous books and particularly, an
English reader Mr. Lamond is pub-
lished by Faber—will probably be
delighted and astonished with the hot,
bare Queensland country, the intimate
and authentic observation of the birds,
the beasts and the weather and the
great skill with which—introducing a
kangaroo-shooter into the plot, who
knows the dingo from its puppyhood
—Mr. Lamond manipulates the animal-
story, which offers so few oppor-
tunities for continuous development,
into a satisfying and sometimes
exciting drama.
Even a reader who knows the
previous books, his country and his
method, will still be taken by surprise
from time to time: for if Mr. Lamond
has done drought before he has always
something fresh to offer—a swallow-
by-swallow description of a python
consuming a kangaroo, for instance; a
fight to the death between two dingoes
caught in traps; a battle between a
dingo and a wildcat.
But it is not only in such major bits
of Nature news that he gets this effect
of freshness. Closeness—intensity—of
observation is the great merit of his
writing, and he can make a memorable
scene out of something as simple as a
dingo eating a tadpole:—
Wading in, White Ears snapped at
the squirming tadpoles... .At the
third attempt he raked a wriggler
out on the land. Taking it between
his teeth, with lips drawn back, he
held it so delicately that, had it been
a butterfly, he would not have
injured it. He shook his head,
i rele f S j n^,/u h . e tadpole When it
landed, White Ears sprang on it and
took it jn his teeth again He let
jt s jj^ e j nto mou th, rolled it with
his tongue and swallowed it. White
Ears walked away from that gilgai
with the appearance of a very polite
mai h had : at a publ * c dinner,
swallowed a tainted oyster.
The faults of Mr. Lamond’s writing
have been noted before: an undue
rawness in his descriptions, harshness
in the style. He surmounts the faults
once again in “Dingo,” which is a very
good book indeed; in fact, a humdingo.
A BALLAD OF DRINKING
By Kenneth Mackenzie
(From some unpublished MSS.)
Much of thirty years I’ve spent
getting drunk with good intent.
Mostly good intent went bad,
driving wives and friends half-mad.
How should I know —how should I
know the rage of being dry?
I was reared by uncles, drinkers
who were pointed out as “thinkers”!
When I grew somewhat more old
milk and water I found cold ;
tea and bread, which was my ration
roused in me no thoughtful passion
such as that my uncles had —
whipping out the stable-lad,
stepping quick from post to post
through the brittle skin of frost,
slapping wire with covered hands —
having a feel of their fat lands.
They had whisky in their tea.
Leaves and lees were left for me.
Bread and butter was my fare
when they ate a wine-jugged hare.
Port and trifles, beer and gin
split the clothes they sat down in.
These were they among whom I
spent my nonage parched and dry.
Is it any wonder, then,
that, a man like other men,
every time I fall to thinking
of my poor dead uncles drinking
I should want to whet my whistle,
set my stem upon a thistle,
tip sky-high the glazy bottle,
let the starlight through its throttle
into mine? It is no wonder:
drink is up —and I am under!

Strangers Meeting: Richard 1 ! Savage:
(Museum). At least it’s a thriller .with
a new idea,, or, at least, an idea: the
escaped crim. with a bullet in his leg
holes-up at a London pub and sends
for the doctor. The doctor having
treated him, the crim. beans him on the
bonnet and goes off around London
with'the doctor’s car, seeking the girl
who shopped him. The doctor’s wife
misses the doctor at the pub and tails
the crim: around London. Meanwhile
the doctor comes-to and with the aid
of a broken-down actor begins to
search for his wife. Thereafter as
may be. Without exactly hitting the
high spots, it passes an attentive half-
hour.

Modem Opera Stories: Gladys
Davidson (Laurie). A query on the
Red Page why Berg’s “Wozzeck” had
been left out of a more general treatise
has been answered in this collection;
Britten is represented by six, operas.
The book is recent enough to take in
Stravinsky’s “Rake’s Progress” and.
Walton’s “Troilus and Cressida,”
recondite enough for Bartok’s “Blue-
beard’s Castle” and reasonable enough
for Lennox Berkeley’s delightful
“Dinner Engagement” (to a “Punch”
libretto) which Professor Peart did so
well a while ago at Sydney University.
Menotti has most operas, one more
than Britten; others are Australian
Arthur Benjamin’s “Tale of Two Cities”
and “Prima Donna,” Michael Tippett’s
“Midsummer Marriage,” Hindemith’s
“Mathis the Painter” and “News of
the Day”—a bright story that opens
with a wild quarrel by a contemporary
couple—and Sir Arthur Bliss’s “The
Olympians.” Of twenty-one composers
represented, the names of seven begin
with B.

Concerning Jazz: edited by Sinclair
Traill (Faber). For those not violently
interested in jazz the big news in this
collection of essays is Gerald Lascelles
on “The Piano in Jazz,” though on
the whole Royalty doesn’t make it
sound veiy different from the jazz
chewed-over by a thousand-and-one
experts with record-libraries. They
all go back to Noo Orleens and rehash
the old, very short, very threadbare
story with something of the conver-
sational ostinato of boogie. But for
those profoundly interested, the others
of ML Traill’s string of seven authori-
ties are Milton (“Mezz”) Mezzrow,
Hugues Panassie, Mike Butcher,
Douglas Hague (“The Jazz Scene:
America”), Traill himself (“British
Traditionalists:”) and Brian:; Nieholls
(“British Mbdernists”).
