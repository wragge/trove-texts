builds a better vinyl floor
Better building starts from the floor. Modern vinyl floorings are deep in colour, easy to clean, scuff and scratch
proof. Because they’re made with Geon, their pore-free surface is resistant to dirt, dust, oils and solvents.
Today, more and more manufacturers are using Geon in vinyl asbestos tiles, flexible vinyl tiles and sheetings.
In any industry, Geon’s versatility helps break the stalemate to product improvement. Have you a product we
can improve or develop?

... my wife’s idea
Put a glass of St. Agnes in his hand—and watch that twinkle of approval
in his eye. You know you’ve done the right thing in having a bottle
of St. Agnes Brandy in the cupboard. St. Agnes is pure, clean and dry.
The words pure’ and clean’ probably describe St. Agnes better than any
other brandy. The very name 'St. Agnes’ was chosen to signify this
purity and cleanliness.
Make sure you are ready to meet the occasion make sure that you
keep a bottle of St. Agnes Brandy in your cupboard. Order a bottle from
your local supplier.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
UNIVERSITIES AND THE PRESS
Sir,
It is regrettable that the Australian
Press, with a few exceptions, still looks
at universities through pre-war eyes.
Surely their actual and potential contri-
butions to national development, and the
fact that they now spend some £5O mil-
lion per annum of public money, war-
rants a serious examination of their
functioning and problems. But we find
that universities are only “news” when
something dramatic like Professor Sal-
ton’s resignation occurs, and even then
the issues must be discussed in terms of
personalities, rather than of principles.
Your article (25/7/64) asked “Why
did Salton resign?” The answer is a
simple one—“because he was not treated
in the way he had been accustomed to
in other universities”. (A Sydney gradu-
ate, he was a Reader in the University
of Manchester when he accepted the
Chair of Microbiology in the University
of NSW.)
We are no longer in the depression
days, and if a first-class scientist finds
the rule of a particular Vice-Chancellor
too irksome he can readily move to
another university, or to another country.
Even so the exasperations have to be
pretty intense before a person takes the
step of cutting his losses and pulling up
his roots, with all the mental and domes-
tic upheaval involved. So, in this case,
the USA gains a first-class microbiolo-
gist, largely trained at the Australian
taxpayers’ expense, and Professor Baxter
another black mark in university circles.
But who cares?
Your article also raised the question of
‘efficiency” in the running of a univer-
sity. By what yardsticks do you measure
this? I would suggest that in absolute
terms this is even more difficult than
measuring the “efficiency” of funda-
mental scientific research. However, aca-
demic staff who have taught in a number
of universities can at least make an
assessment ©f their relative efficiency. Of
the three id which I have taught,
namely Cambridge, Sydney and NSW,
I would rank Cambridge as the most
efficient and NSW as the least. It is no
coincidence that Cambridge has the most
democratic and decentralised university

STUDENTS’ ALP CLUBS
Sir,
The news that Mr John Johnston,
elected president of Melbourne Univer-
sity ALP Club as head of the “Knopfel-
macher ticket”, has now joined the DLP
seems to clinch my argument. All I
have been saying is that Knopfelmacher
is not an ALP supporter in any sense of
the word, that his association with the
club is a source of difficulty and, now,
disruption. There are now three “Labor”
clubs where once there were two. His
association with the ALP Club has re-
duced it to its lowest level for years and
broken up what was a very effective,
democratic socialist and non-Communist
organisation.
What is being contested is not Dr
Knopfelmacher’s right to hold views
which, of course, I knew about for some
years. He has now openly praised Mr
Santamaria and Sir Wilfrid Kent-Hughes
in your columns and that is very honest
of him. His views are his business.
What is objectionable is that he should
carry his obsession \ 'th the university
Communists (who now number nine) to
the point of seriously damaging the most
important political club among Austra-
lian students. Even at the time of
writing he is still trying to exercise
influence as to the person to replace
Mr Johnston. It would surely be much
more honest to follow Mr Johnston’s
example and join the DLP than to con-
tinue to associate with organisations
which he does not trust.
There seems little more to say on this
issue, except to hope that radical students
at Melbourne will soon be able to repair
the damage done to their reputation by
getting so far up an anti-Communist
blind alley that they have lost sight of
their positive reasons for preferring
democratic socialism.

“DISCUS” AND THE GAMES
Sir,
I think it is high time someone
picked up your “Discus” and threw it.
I say “it” because “Discus”, although
forever ready to criticise our Olympic
athletes in no uncertain terms, is not so
ready to reveal its sex, let alone its name.
“Discus’s” comment (25/7/64) re-
garding the “150 athletes who will be
participating for the pleasure of a free
trip to Tokyo” fails to account for the
possibility that these 150 or more “no-
hopers” will more than likely be taxing
their physical and mental resources to
the limit in an endeavor to justify their
selection and maintain their personal
integrity. As for “Discus’s” reference to
the “largest squad of no-hopers in his-
tory”, then one can only say—“ Discus”,
you may be partly right, but you don’t
seem to have much faith in the maxim
“nothing ventured nothing gained”. Do
the favorites always win? And do the
no-hopers always do hopelessly?

AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE
Sir,
The increasing number of people who
are worried by the accumulating threats
to Australian wildlife must feel a good
deal of sympathy with the views expres-
sed by the correspondent who disguises
himself as “Major Mitchell” (4/7/64),
and they will not want to argue with his
conclusion that “the whole question of
the administration of the export of fauna
and the role of some zoos seems a ques-
tion for very close Government scru-
tiny”.
It is therefore a pity that “Major
Mitchell”, in making his point, has
allowed himself several assertions which
may have been true once upon a time
and others which are certainly not the
only valid interpretation of the facts, with
the result that reading his article could
very easily give a false impression of the
present state of things in South Austra-
lia. They are not quite so bad as “Major
Mitchell” would have us believe,
although there is still a good deal of
room for improvement. Much has been
done for the better conservation of native
fauna in the last five years. The area of
national parks and reserves has been
very greatly increased, the Department
of Fisheries and Game has been re-
organised and expanded, the Flora and
Fauna Advisory Committee has been
reconstructed, and new legislation has
been drafted to replace the Animals and
Birds Protection Act 1919-1938. Pro-
gress of this sort is manifestly not pos-
sible without Government support.

THE COMMONWEALTH
Sir,
In “Plain English” (18/7/64) you
stated that the Commonwealth has not
and never did have any “force, power
and cohesion”. The British Common-
wealth obviously played a dominant role
in the First World War and, if one exa-
mines the whole period of the Second
World War, it is evident that in actual
fighting, orginality and thoroughness of
planning, and above all in leadership, the
British Commonwealth made much the
greatest contribution. The British total
dead, and missing, presumed dead, of
the armed forces amounted to a total of
412,240. Against this figure the United
States mourn the deaths in the Army and
Air Force, the Navy, Marines, and
Coastguard of 322,188. Out of 781
German and 85 Italian U-boats destroyed
in the European theatre, the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans, 594 were accounted for
by British sea and air forces, who also
disposed of all the German battleships,
cruisers and destroyers, besides destroy-
ing or capturing the whole Italian Fleet.

Sir,
Mr Donald Horne’s article, “Common-
wealth Rhetoric?” (25/7/64), implies
more than a re-examination of Austra-
lia’s relations with the Commonwealth;
it implies a re-examination of all our
foreign relations. Mr Horne’s formula
is simple. Australia should pay court to
whichever nations appear to be follow-
ing policies directly advantageous to us
at a given moment. This policy gives
great flexibility, as Mr Horne has shown,
for “India became a more important
country to Australia when the Chinese
invaded it, and Pakistan became less im-
portant when it began to deal with the
Chinese”.
Mr Horne’s system certainly offers
flexibility, but by following it we may
rapidly find ourselves unable to work
within any existing international group-
ing. But then Mr Horne appears to find
little value in attempts at international
co-operation unless they fall within his
terms of Australia’s self interest.
Mr Horne attacks the Commonwealth
from many angles: it lacks definition, it
has not become a symbol of multi-
racialism in Australia, Australia is not as
“British” as it used to be, it is “increa-
singly becoming an African pressure
group”. The Commonwealth obviously
cuts right across Mr Horne’s formula
that we should be friendly to those who
appear to be of direct value to us, but
ignore the remainder. The Common-
wealth is an association of nations who,
during the imperial period, developed
some common ties (language, education
systems, government organisations
modelled on the same foundations, etc.).
These nations have individually decided
that it is of value to retain an informal
relationship in which their diverse and
often conflicting interests can be dis-
cussed and in which existing ties can be
confirmed and extended.
Mr Horne has stated that Australia
has shown “its recognition of a broad,
co-operative self interest that may in-
volve sacrifices” by joining in the two
world wars, but as almost every nation in
the world joined in these wars there are
few who cannot claim the same distinc-
tion.

THE MASS IN ENGLISH
Sir,
Sunday, August 2, was ME (Mass-in-
English) Day over here on the West
Coast. It went off somewhat lamely
because of the unfortunate and culpable
delay in the arrival from Sydney of
copies of the official text of the parts of
the Mass henceforth to be said in English
by the people. WA was served last in
the distribution of the texts. Hastily
duplicated sheets were poor substitutes
on so solemn and historic an occasion. 1
To add to the confusion, priests and'
people were bewildered by bumbling ij
high places. The interpretation of a last-
minute request, signed by one of the'
secretaries of the Liturgy Commission in!
Rome, delaying the implementation or
some of the points already agreed on and
published by the bishops of Australia
after their recent meeting, has produced
a most remarkable example of episcopal
parlor games and not very inspired guess-
work.
There have been almost as many inter-
pretations in details as there are dioceses,
Some dioceses who had already swung;
into action as soon as the official texts,
arrived e.g., Maitland have chosen
to disregard the delaying request com-
pletely. Others, in particular, Sydney,
have bent over backwards in reversing
previous decisions, trying to prove, I
suppose, that they were truly Romans
and not naughty boys at all.
Even in a backwater like WA the dio-
ceses of Perth and Bunbury differ in
interpreting the request. Many of the
current interpretations are ambiguous,
some confusing and all largely fatuous,
as none of them concerns anything of
real moment. The overall result has been
frustration and annoyance and a general
lessening of respect for episcopal
authority.
In this ecumenical era, the whole
business has done nothing to allay the
suspicion among our separated Christian'
brothers that, despite all the fine words*
about episcopal authority and indepen-;
dence, the final say in all matters remains!
with the “faceless men” in Rome, who 1
exercise authority capriciously.
In the changes there have been some|
anomalies which people have not been
slow to seize on. If, they say, we are!
expected to benefit from hearing parts'
of the Mass in our own language, what'
prevents the extension of this principle
to the whole Mass? Why is the most
solemn part of the Mass still recited
silently by the priest in Latin?
There has been some comment on the
translation prepared by the bishops.
“Seen and unseen” in the Creed, for
example, is not only awkward but not
strictly accurate. There is a lack of
graciousness in the Dismissal and the
people’s response. “Go, the Mass is
ended.” —“Thanks be to God.” This
last response argues to some basic lack
of awareness of common Australian
usage.
Priests who over the years have fallen
into the rut of the rapid Latin mumble
must now realise that they are expected
to be heard and understood as well as
being merely seen and not heard. “Slow
up and speak up” could well be the
motto.
Anyway, lest I myself appear grace-
less, I think the bishops’ hearts are in
the right place and, on the whole, they
have done a remarkably competent job.

This wagon is a graphic, practical
example of what aluminium bodies
can do for rolling stock; it can in-
crease the efficiency of any goods or
passenger operation!
In the case of this wagon and others
like it, being built by A. E. Goodwin
Ltd. for the New South Wales Govern-
ment Railways, the use of Australuco
aluminium cut the tare weight by one-
third! Hence, a greater load can be
carried. And, there is ample strength
in aluminium to take that extra load.
Of course, there’s more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years of
experience in research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.
So, when you add technical skill and
expertise to aluminium’s inherent
qualities (no rust or rot, no mainten-
ance, no painting, corrosion resist-
ance), achievement and performance
are the natural results.
Australuco’s engineers and techni-
cians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium in all phases
of Australian industry.

Coming in on Copper!

Landing aids for modern aircraft and
the radar systems which “see” for them
have their nerve systems printed in copper.
Printed circuits demonstrate the outstand-
ing electrical conductivity of copper . . .
connecting “ribbons” of thicknesses down
to .0015 of an inch can be used to carry
considerable current without heat problems.
This is only one of many applications of copper in the air-
craft industry. For example, this giant Boeing carries almost
five miles of copper electrical wiring in a variety of gauges.
Because of copper’s unique qualities, it is closely associated
with a multitude of new techniques in the whole field of
electronics.

National Notebook
taught But Not So Bright
Trim, bespectacled Jim Davidson,
former BBC light entertainment pro-
ducer and for many years before that
rdABC Radio Orchestra leader, is back
ryhere after 17 years in Britain. The man
awho produced such shows as “The
Goons”, “Take It From Here” (“The
ihow was scheduled to run only four
! S more performances when I took it over
Ind revivified it.”) and Hancock’s Half
Bour, finds the local radio scene dismal
Ind the standards of entertainment
algenerally far from bright,
ee “We still seem to be imbued with that
ofold Australian philosophy ‘The other
poke’s grass is always greener’ and the
]©oner we cease relying on overseas
"jtalent the better we’ll be,” he told us in
pis Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, flat.
Back in Australia “to seek the sun”,
iDavidson feels we have untapped talent
which can only come to the surface by
ising techniques of promotion he suc-
cessfully undertook during his term with
"|ie BBC. “The talent must be here,” he
laid. “The success of so many Austra-
[ians overseas proves that.
%it only by seeking it out
I |n a nation-wide basis,
presenting State capital
sshows that would culmi-
■iiiate in a show featuring
s4ie pick of the finds in
Sydney possibly in the
itftadium or a big theatre can we pro-
vide a source of entertainment for our
radio and TV shows,
e “The type of show I visualise would
ninclude folk music, pops, specialty acts
es'-all the qualities that are being accept-
ed overseas as the basis for modern enter-
fainment.”
t Jim Davidson began his career in the
(Advertising department of the Lever
[Organisation where he formed a staff
|azz band. After playing around the night
n<?ots of Sydney, he made his first broad-
cast over 2FC in 1932, “and that was
(iie first Australian broadcast of any
land’. In 1935 he became leader of the
.™C’s National Radio Orchestra and
,toyed with the Commission until 1940
*hen, with comedian Jim Gerald, he
j/tored the Middle East entertaining the
„roops.
’ After working with the ABC and the
Jivoli Circuit, he took off on a world
and landed in Britain in 1948 where
Le BBC offered him a post in their
rariety-music division. For 17 years he
[ as head of productions responsible for
' e roajor light entertainment shows that
over the three BBC networks and
heir Overseas Service . . .
I think the secret of my success was
my ability to see the potentialities in
people. Dick Bentley and Joy Nichols
I knew well from Australia. Yet in “Take
It From Here” they were doing rather
badly because they were produced as
themselves, not as characters. I re-formed
the show and it ran for another 11 years.
“I introduced Frank Ifield, Eric Jupp,
George Mitchell’s Glee Club, now
famous as the ‘Black and White Minstrel
Show’. Some people say Hancock is dif-
ficult to work with. I always found Tony
most co-operative. Mind you, he was
very shy. I remember a luncheon we
organised for him at the Aeolian Hall.
One o’clock came —no Tony, 1.30
still no Tony. At two o’clock we
decided to go out looking for him. We
found him in a nearby saloon bar trying
to get up enough courage to come and
face all the people there to honor him.”
Dirty Word
TPhe South Australian Government is
A believed to be considering the estab-
lishment of a State lottery. Lottery is a
dirty word in SA. (Last month, a Glenelg
woman received £120,000
in an “interstate wind-
fall”.) A lottery is seen as
a “middle course” between
TAB and football pools
in SA. Premier Playford
is strongly opposed to
TAB, and football pools
might fall foul of the State’s Lotteries
and Gaming Act. However, moves for
the establishment of football pools are
well advanced, and if the Government
decides on a lottery, it is expected to
waste no time in establishing it.
By using a system similar to Victoria
and Tasmania, the SA Government could
receive Isi per cent of all lottery ticket
sales from an independent operator, such
as Tattersalls. This is opposed to the
considerable cost of establishing TAB
offices throughout the State.
A lottery would keep in SA thousands
of pounds that leave annually for inter-
state consultations. It would also boost
the State Treasury, which is heading for
a record deficit, and would be an attrac-
tive alternative to the imposition of
higher State charges or taxes before the
elections next March. In Parliament,
Playford has denied that the Govern-
ment is considering the establishment of
a lottery.

“Commissioner's yacht” of the Maritime
Services Board of NSW, laid down in
1902 and still to be seen knifing through
the waters of Sydney Harbor. With
elegantly-raked upperworks, gloss-black
hull, and brass fittings like heliographs,
the yacht is a symbol of past imperial
splendor.
The Lady Hopetoun is the floating
boardroom of the Maritime Services
Board, but is best known as a showboat
for visitors whom the State Government
is entertaining. In her time she has car-
ried ambassadors, footballers and beauty
queens. The roll-call of her celebrities
would stretch the length of any red
carpet.
Now her career is ending, and a re-
placement for her will soon be launched
at the Board's yard on Goat Island. This
is the Captain Phillip, a flush - deck
motor cruiser, also of 76 feet, powered
by twin Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The
Captain Phillip, of which we were
shown a plan the other day by the
Board’s public relations man, Mr Ken
Sweetman, will cost upwards of £BO,OOO,
and will have a white hull with a tran-
som of polished teak, and accommoda-
tion for daytime use. The teak transom
struck us as a sybaritic touch for a Gov-
ernment vessel.
It was strange, but the more we
learned of the Captain Phillip, the
more concerned we felt for what was to
become of the old Lady Hopetoun.
Mr Sweetman was troubled about her
disposal, too. He did not seem to feel
much confidence in the approaches which
he said several people have already made
to buy her for private purposes. As he
pointed out, you just couldn't let anyone
turn a showpiece like that into a house-
boat, could you?
Resignation
HPhe chief executive officer of the
Adelaide Festival of Arts has
resigned, victim, apparently, of the
Adelaide “Establishment”. Sir Lloyd
Dumas, deputy-chairman of the Festival’s
Board of Governors, announced that
Mr David Peters had quit his £3OOO-
--year job “for his own reasons”. Mr
Peters has so far refused to elaborate.
Mr Peters came to Adelaide about 18
months ago, chosen from 70 applicants.
As deputy-director for the Arts Council
of Great Britain in Wales, Mr Peters
was responsible for the administration
and planning of the council’s operations
in Wales, including festivals.
In mid-Festival this year, Mr Peter;;
as a name, ceased to exist. The Adelaide,
“Advertiser” began attributing all FesW
val statements to an anonymous spokes
man. Now comes the resignation. Th|
“News” gave the announcement Pag
One treatment “SA Festival Shock;
Next morning, the “Advertiser”
the announcement away under itj
“Personal” column.
The Adelaide Festival of Arts slippy
“Advertiser” assistant-editor Max Lam
shedy into the vacancy. Now all Adelaid,
is waiting for September 30 when Mi
Peters leaves the Festival office at thi
“Advertiser”. Perhaps then he will
elaborate.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Winning Wars and
Losing Countries?
As The Bulletin goes to Press
** the risk of the Vietnamese
crisis escalating into a major war
—conventional let alone nuclear—
recedes. A risk certainly remains
but it seems that neither Red China
nor North Vietnam are willing to
risk the awesome results of chal-
lenging US military power to a
showdown. Just why the North
Vietnamese chose to provoke the
United States at this stage is not
clear, whether it was a unilateral
action or provoked by Red China
or whether it was merely to probe
the strength of US reactions with
the fringe benefit of embarrassing
the USSR by forcing it on side,
remains a mystery. The one in-
disputable fact to emerge from the
crisis is that the US intends to
remain in South Vietnam and will
take the war into North Vietnam
and to Red China itself if that
intention is challenged. US resolve
on this matter has been known for
some time and it is both idle and
mischievous to suppose that the
American response, so firm and so
massive, was merely the result of
election-year politics or Democratic
“me tooism” in response to Senator
Goldwater’s easy demands for
firmer action against Communist
aggression.
XXowever, while the unequivocal
statement of US intentions to
save South Vietnam is reassuring
and welcome, there can be little
doubt that the war in Vietnam is
slowly and surely being lost to the
Viet Cong. There are many reasons
why this is so which Denis Warner
graphically describes in a Saigon
Newsletter on page 39. One of
them is the incapacity of the US to
take the war north into Vietnam,
unless provoked, without risking a
major collision with Red China and
setting all South Asia alight. An-
other is the fear of nuclear conflict
with the USSR. In this situation
South Vietnam is like a man fight-
ing off an enemy with one hand
tied behind his back. Quite apart
from superior military skills and
organisation, the Viet Cong are free
to cross the border into South
Vietnam, terrorise the peasant
population, carry out savage re-
prisals, burn villages, use plastic
bombs against defenceless city
dwellers, decimate livestock, destroy
food stores and then retire to the
sanctuary on the other side of the
17th Parallel. This is one of the
tough, endless, frustrating con-
ditions of the war in Vietnam
which is becoming that ultimately
self-defeating military operation
the defensive war.
"Out it is also a war which the
■*“* South Vietnamese have tragically
mismanaged. It is now three years
since General Maxwell Taylor first
went to Saigon to try and work out
a plan of operations. He quickly
recognised that the war would not
necessarily be won by marching
into North Vietnam, but that it
could ultimately be lost in South
Vietnam unless its Government
and people were restored in morale
and purpose. He asked for special
implementation of a grass - roots
technique in politically indoctri-
nating village leaders and peasant
cadres with a sense of nationalism.
He asked for land reform, for the
extension of representative institu-
tions to the villages, for greater
medical and social welfare services,
for an end to bribery and corrup-
tion in the Diem regime, for a blue-
print to meet rising levels of
economic expectation and, most of
all, for a rapid extension of educa-
tional facilities.
All that came out of these nego-
tiations were the strategic hamlets
which in nearly every instance
proved useless and in a number of
cases were little better than prisons.
Peasants were resettled in the
hamlets, often at bayonet-point and
usually without compensation. Pay-
ment consisted principally of forced
labor without pay. Diem officials
felt free to rob them of their live-
stock and rice supplies. In turn
they were taxed for the upkeep of
the hamlets. These mistakes were
accompanied by a disastrous mis-
calculation of Viet Cong military
capacity.
T'he South Vietnamese concen-
A trated on creating and organ-
ising a conventional military force
in the hope of meeting the Viet
Cong in a set battle. The Viet
Cong organised along the guerrilla
lines laid down by Mao and General
Giap, the victor of Dien Bien Phu.
The results have been catastrophic.
Last July, in 190 battalion-scale
operations and 30,000 small-unit
operations, South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment forces made only 240 con-
tacts with Viet Cong forces. The
Viet Cong, as Mr Warner points
out. are everywhere and nowhere.
Therefore, while America’s
blunt announcement that it will
defend South Vietnam against
aggression, and will meet war with
war if necessary, is to be welcomed,
the main task of the US obviously
lies in taking a strong hand in
restoring the confidence and morale
of the South Vietnamese people in
their long and bitter struggle since
1946. This may mean getting tough
with the South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment with polite, firm insistence
on internal reforms. Unless internal
morale is restored in South Viet-
nam along with genuine economic
and political reform, the United
States, and its Pacific allies, face
the proposition that increased
military aid may help win battles
while losing a country.


THIS AUSTRALIA
COMMUNISTS
ALP-The Handmaiden
of the Unions?
Questions of loyalty
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
GOUGH WHITLAM
More realistic
Tf, as the Left-wing States and unions
insist, the ALP is the servant of the
trade union movement, does that make
the ALP increasingly the servant of the
Communist Party as the party extends its
control over the movement? Sooner or
later somebody in the ALP has to give
the answer to that basic question.
In States other than NSW and, pos-
sibly, Tasmania, the ALP insists that the
question will never really arise. If the
ALP leaves the trade union movement
alone, the movement will see that it is
controlled by persons sympathetic to the
ALP cause. The Communist Party will
never be in a position to use the ALP as
its servant through control over the
movement.
NSW takes a different view. It ac-
cepts the view of Federal deputy Labor
leader Gough Whitlam that the ALP
must do something to prevent the “poli-
tical subversion” of the movement. I
think NSW is more realistic than the
other States.
It is also more experienced. When
NSW State secretary W. R. Colbourne
told of individuals getting letters from
him to prove they were ALP members
he said he knew why they were doing
so; they were helping themselves, but
they were also helping non-ALP mem-
bers with whom they were associating in
trade union ballots. It was to prevent
such dubious practices—which assist the
Communist Party to obtain control of
unions—that the NSW officials sought
and obtained overwhelming endorsement
for the proposal that NSW should certify,
on request, full tickets of ALP members
participating in union ballots.
Though NSW is the largest and politi-
cally the most effective Labor grouping
in Australia—it still holds 20 of the 46
NSW Federal seats, despite having to
carry the shortcomings of the Federal
ALP at the 1963 Federal elections —this
proposal was knocked over at the Federal
ALP executive meeting last week. NSW
was instructed to observe the present
policy of non-interference in trade
union affairs, at least until its proposal
is examined by the ALP Federal Con-
ference, Labor’s supreme policy-making
body, in August, 1965.
I suggest that if you examine the state-
ments of Mr M. O'Brien, Federal secre-
tary of the Australian Railways Union,
to the NSW ALP conference in June,
you can see why the ALP must in-
creasingly become susceptible to Com-
munist Party influence while it continues
to leave unchallenged the spread of
Communist control in the trade union
movement. Mr O'Brien says quite
frankly that if there is a clash between
his ALP loyalties and his union loyalties,
his first loyalty is to the union.
Mr O’Brien’s union is Communist-
influenced. Naturally, in this context it
tends to follow such Communist policies
as the Communist leaders can safely
propose short of outraging the member-
ship and thereby producing a revolt. In
some ways the policies of the union and
the ALP must conflict. One obvious
point of conflict is unity tickets. The
Communist leadership of the ARU
favors “unity” between the workers’
parties (and will continue to do so while
its association with selected ALP mem-
bers help it maintain control over the
union’s policies). Mr O'Brien had a
clash of loyalties on this issue, and his
opposition to the NSW proposal is part
of that clash, as he himself indicated.
Multiply the case and attitude of M r j
O'Brien a few dozen, often a few score-
of times, and you have a fairly tight
block of votes which is prepared to gjJ
its first loyalty to its unions, even at ALH
conferences.
Superimpose on that the unfortunate
experience the ALP had with the indus-
trial groups—which can be exploited iff
such States as South Australia, where
Communism is comparatively uninfluent
tial—and you have a position in which
the ALP will not try a new, less danger-
ous method of keeping the trade unior
movement under predominantly ALP
control. ;
It is not without significance that the'.
States which combined to thwart the,
NSW proposal at the request of sis]
unions—some of them strongly Commii- 1 ]
nist-influenced —were (1) Those iij
which the trade unions, including thosl
subject to Communist influence, havf
become increasingly powerful in that
political machine; and (2) Those to
the now defunct ALP industrial group!
are no longer an unhappy part of Labor'll
history but a red flag across their eyests
blinding them to everything else. «
NSW took a bad rebuff last week, ami
my impression is that the Left-wingers'
'do not particularly care how damaging
the rebuff may possibly be to the politic
cal prospects of the only surviving Stat&
Labor Government on the mainland]
But sooner or later somebody in thf
ALP has to face the question of thf
future of the ALP if the Communist
Party extends its control over the tradty
union movement. Is it to be a hand"
maiden of the movement in which the
Communist influence has become morf
powerful than the influence of those whij-
adhere to its political concepts? Ol
is it to be an empty front?

Kenya, for a Decent

General Suadi’s parting words
FROM SAM LIPSKY IN CANBERRA
ENVOY SUADI
Wanted more time
11/fuGGA Way, already showing signs of
an early blossoming spring, has a
new status symbol—the objets d’art of
Brigadier General Suadi Suromihardjo,
the departing Indonesian ambassador
With his recall to Djakarta Brigadiej
Suadi has had to auction his collects
of Balinese furniture and wood carving*


|oil paintings and ornaments. The paint-
ings include two Indonesian nudes, Bali-
nese girls, some seascapes and land-
scapes. Less exotic items include a set
iof golf clubs, two stereograms, and an
Bnim movie camera.
Brigadier Suadi's next post is Addis
.Ababa. The problems of transportation,
(packing and space forced him to sell the
(carvings and paintings. As for the golf
[clubs, he said: “I don't think there are
[very many country clubs in Addis Ababa,
I might have to go to Kenya or Ghana
for a decent game of golf.”
Ambassador Suadi spoke of his three-
;year stay in Australia, his first diplomatic
post after a career as a field commander
fin the army. “To be frank, I don’t
think I have fulfilled the job of bringing
greater understanding between our two
countries. I would have liked more
'time. But an order is an order.”
; Had he seen any changes in the way
'Australians regarded Indonesia? In the

ted. The visits to Indonesia of uni-
ky students and graduates have helped.”
I On the debit side he was very con-
feerned about the Australian Press and
Iwhat he called “their attempts to create
fan artificial feeling of opposition to
'lndonesia.” Press hostility had worsened
(during his stay, and, although he and his
(staff had written many letters to news-
papers correcting reports, these had been
published only rarely.
Brigadier Suadi saw Australians as
(divided between the “younger generation
and the man in the street” and “the pro-
minent figures in political life.” There
were too many leading politicians, in
both the Opposition and Government
parties who thought about the outside
world in outdated 19th century concepts.
“The world is rapidly changing. We
Indonesians are looking forward 30 years
from now, 50 years from now, when
your young people will become leaders.
The present leaders are looking back-
ward.”
The men in public life who had im-
pressed him as having an understanding
of Indonesia and Asia were the late
Athol Townley, the late Sir John Latham,
and Sir Garfield Barwick. And of these
he remembered Mr Townley with par-
ticular affection.
In the context of world politics, Aus-
tralia could not determine her own inde-
pendent policy because she was associa-
ted with the Commonwealth and the
United States. Did Indonesia always
act independently? “We are non-aligned,
but we do make mistakes.”
Because it had been his first diploma-
tic post after fighting rebels in the jungle,
Canberra had meant some adjustments.
What he had enjoyed most had been
“confrontation on the sports field”. A
typical Saturday had been golf in the
morning, tennis after lunch, then some
badminton and a few sets of squash to
follow. But keeping fit is not just a
matter of pleasure.
At 43, Brigadier Suadi is still on the
active list. In May he carried out his
regular parachute training so that he
could retain his wings. He does not
know when he might have to make his
next jump.
UNIONS
Battle for a Clean Ballot
Troubles of a Left-wing Secretary
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
the triennial elections of the
Builders’ Laborers’ Federation are
n ot to be held until September, opposing
factions are already fighting a bitter
struggle for control of this troubled
jfcnion.
The federation’s NSW secretary, M.
McNamara (ALP), is being opposed by
P n e of the organisers, S. Winter. Win-
der, who is running on a full ALP ticket,
/ president of the Darlinghurst ALP
and alternate delegate to the
pSW Central Executive of the ALP.
] Members supporting Winter’s ticket
e . are determined to keep a close watch on
r aspects of the ballot; there have been
claims that, due to the nature of the
industry, opportunities for malpractice
exist. Signatures to a petition to the
Commonwealth Industrial Registrar for
a court-controlled ballot have been col-
lected, and this has resulted in a sus-
tained hostile campaign against Winter
from both Federal and State levels,
along with a Federal Management plea
to members who have signed the petition
to withdraw their names. Some members
claim that subtle coercion is being ap-
plied. If the Communists succeeded in
having the application for a court-con-
trolled ballot defeated they could well
be on their way to nullify the whole
“clean ballot” legislation. McNamara and
most of the present officials were elected
in a court-controlled ballot in 1961.
A number of Communists hold office
in the union and this, perhaps, is one
reason for the campaign against
Winter. Of seven paid organisers,
J. Mundy (generally assumed to be the
power behind the throne) and B. McGill
are Communists. Two others, C. Mc-
Hugh and B. Prendegast, have been
expelled from the ALP, McHugh for
standing as a Communist in a municipal
election and Prendegast for standing on
a unity ticket. Winter and T. Austin
are ALP members and the seventh, C.
Smith, is non-party but generally sup-
ports a left line. The federation's pre-
sident, A. Harding, is a well-known
Communist.
grouping of officials poses a
A dilemma for McNamara. If he runs
an ALP ticket he alienates the Com-
munists and he is left without their
support. If, on the other hand, he runs
on a unity ticket, as expected, he will
most certainly be charged; and, the mood
of the NSW Executive being what it is,
his expulsion would be more than likely.
McNaffiara, a recent visitor to Peking,
could be in the position of choosing
between his job and the ALP. Up to
the present he has shown no sign of
deserting his Communist allies. The
relative standing of the opponents in the
ALP is indicated by the positions they
occupied on the State Executive “how
to vote'’ ticket at the recent conference;
Winter was placed 43rd and McNamara
79th.
The hostility among the various fac-
tions in the pre-election struggle is only
a surface indication of the unrest in the
union. The balance sheet for the year
ended 1963 showed a serious decline in
membership and a union debt to the
bank of £l2OO, while it is estimated'
that the NSW branch now owes the
Federal Office £3OOO. The NSW mem-
bership figure of 6000 is considered un-
real (in the 1961 election only 1700
voted). That a union in such a precari-
ous financial situation, and with so small
a membership, should employ, full-time,
seven organisers, a secretary, a treasurer/
clerk and four office girls is one item
its members are criticising; another is
that the union runs six cars.
One odd aspect of this election is that
opposition to Winter’s ALP ticket, which
includes ex-pugilist and part Aborigine
W. (Billy) Stanley, has brought about
a united front of Moscow- and Peking-
oriented Communists as well as of Left-
wing ALP members.
It is thought that Winter’s ticket will
give a very good account of itself, with
Winter himself an even money bet to
topple McNamara.


LAW-I
Is Australia a
British dominion?
A fugitive's case raises an interesting
point of law
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
BRUCE MILES
Challenged. Act
T ast week a Sydney solicitor chal-
lenged the validity in Australia of
the Fugitives Offenders Act passed by
British Parliament 83 years ago. The
solicitor, Mr Bruce Miles, was represent-
ing Abraham Israel Sampson who ap-
peared before Mr C. S. Rodgers, SM, in
the Special Federal Court on eight
charges of fraud in Hong Kong, invol-
ving £1940.
Mr V. Summerhayes (for the Crown
Solicitor) applied for Sampson's extra-
dition to Hong Kong to face the charges
which he alleged took place in August,
1960. Opposing bail, Mr Summerhayes
said Sampson left Hong Kong in 1960,
after the alleged offences were commit-
ted. In 1961 Sampson went to Lebanon,
Mr Summerhayes said. Sampson was
gaoled for two months in Beirut for
having a forged travel document in his
possession. Mr Summerhayes said that
in 1962 two people were involved in
uttering valueless cheques in Fiji. A
passport photograph of one of these
was identical with Sampson, he said.
Mr Miles said Sampson, who was an
Australian, contested any right a court
in Hong Kong sought to exercise against
him. The Fugitives Offenders Act passed
by the British Parliament in 1881 states
that any fugitive from justice who
allegedly commits an offence in a British
dominion may be extradited from ano-
ther British dominion for trial.
“I challenge the applicability of the
Act in Australia,” said Mr Miles. “That
Act is not an Act of the Australian
Commonwealth or of this State ... it
is the Act of Britain and of another
century. It is an Act of the time gone
past and an Act which fitted into the
social and world pattern as events stood
then. It has no semblance to the modern
age.
“When British Parliament passed this
Act there was no question of what a
dominion was —Britain dominated the
whole of the British Empire which in-
cluded Hong Kong and Australia.”
Mr Miles said Australia was now not
dominated by Britain in any shape or
form and thus was not a dominion, nor
was Hong Kong. For Sampson to be
extradited to Hong Kong we have to
acknowledge we are bound by the Fugi-
tives Offenders Act passed by the British
Parliament 83 years ago.
“If this community wants an Austra-
lian brought back from halfway across
the world or an Australian taken away
the Australian people should say so by
clear legislation,” Mr Miles said. “I
submit neither my client nor my client’s
case comes within the description of the
Act: We live by the social usages of
this country.”
Mr Rodgers said the submission was
interesting and one which presented J
great deal of food for thought. “But an
this particular stage I am prepared to
hold the Act is applicable,” he said ad-
journing the hearing to August 18 and
refusing bail.
Should the Court ultimately uphold
Mr Miles’ submission it would be largely
on the basis of the Act’s non-applicability
to present day Australia. And this might
mean that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment would be forced to fill the
“vacuum” itself by legislation.
Even if the magistrate made an extra-
dition order there is a period of 15 daysi
before Sampson would be handed over
to the extraditing authority. During
this period it is possible Sampson would
have the right to apply to the High Court
of Australia to rule on the Act’s appli-
cability. Sampson has the legal right
between now and August 18 to apply to
a Supreme Court judge for bail.
Two points arise from the case: Is
Australia a dominion? and what is Aus-
tralia’s relationship to Britain?
LAW II
Shorn by Black Sheep
Something more than a misdemeanor
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
IY/Jisappropriations by legal men have
left Victoria’s Solicitors’ Guarantee
Fund in poor shape. The fund was set
up by the legal profession to help people
who had suffered from the defalcations
of its black sheep, and each of Victoria’s
1100 solicitors contributed £lO per
annum to it.
One such black sheep, Arthur Leslie
Row, 40, appeared in the Criminal Court
last week, charged with misappropriation
of £86,468 of clients’ money. He was
found guilty and sentenced to the
maximum punishment, seven years’ gaol.
The court was told that £25,000 of
the money had finished up with book-
makers. In sentencing Row, Mr Justice
Monahan noted, perhaps with irony, that
despite the magnitude of the sum in-
volved, the offence was still ranked in
law as “a misdemeanor”.
Put in blunt terms, the Solicitors’
Guarantee Fund is in no condition to
stand the strain imposed on it by the
Row case. The President of the Law
Institute of Victoria, Mr David Murray,
said after Row’s conviction that the
Institute’s Council had been trying for
a time to strengthen the fund. For this
to be done, amending legislation would
have to be passed by Parliament. Mr
Murray expressed the personal hope that
this would be done when Parliament
next met.
I
If so, said Mr Murray, it was very
likely that clients defrauded by Row
would be repaid in full. At the moment,
however, the fund could not do this.!
Mr Murray also revealed that the Law
Institute Council had, for some time,:
been seeking improvements in thej
methods used to detect and prevent dis-
honesty in solicitors’ offices. For all
that, he added, “the confidence reposed
by clients in the legal profession is well-
founded”.

Selby, said that Mrs Meyer had been
married and divorced in Hungary before
she and Meyer married in Sydney in
1957 before the Deputy District Regi-
strar.
Mr Justice Selby said Meyer claimed
the Hungarian divorce was not valid
because a bill of divorcement had not
been obtained from a rabbinical author-
ity, so Mrs Meyer was not subsequently
free to marry him.
“Mr Jones (for Mrs Meyer) argued
that Australian marriage law does not
restrict Jews in the way they may con-
tract marriage but sanctions a marriage
which has been celebrated according to
Jewish usage,” Mr Justice Selby said.
“In Jewish marriage there are only
two basic essentials. These are that
there must be consent to marriage, to-
gether with one of three other elements
—the passing of a ring or token, the
execution of a deed of contract or subse-
quent cohabitation.
“The petitioner agreed before a regi-
strar to take the respondent as lawful
wife. They subsequently cohabitated.
This combination of circumstances con-
stitutes a valid marriage.”
Mr Justice Selby found that the civil
divorce of Mrs Meyer was valid under
the rules of domicile.
He ordered Meyer to pay costs and
adjourned a petition by Meyer on the
ground of cruelty and a cross-petition
by Mrs Meyer on the same ground.
A DISMAL HERO
ffitfeulietin
Saturday, August 16, 1884
Tt is a humiliating fact that among
-*■ civilised nations flogging had been
abolished by all but the two most
arbitrary and backward governments
Austria and Russia till a few
years ago, when England, in a fit of
popular “funk”, took the saddening
course of stepping back to join these
two. The circumstances which led to
this colony introducing flogging were
somewhat similar to those which had
the same effect in Great Britain. But
when all that can be urged against
the practice is said, not a shadow of
justification is created for the fashion
in which an agitation has been worked
up respecting the man ANDERSEN.
An infuriated attack has been made
upon the officers of the law, instead
of a solid assault upon the law itself.
The facts of the case have been, ap-
parently with design, misrepresented;
and the drunken, dirty scoundrel,
ANDERSEN, has been elevated to
the dignity of a hero and martyr.
The law is this: Any person “Who,
in any public place or in view thereof,
exposes his person, or commits any
other indecent act,” is liable to be
flogged. Did ANDERSEN so offend,
and was his offence flagrant? The
actual evidence, as given in the deposi-
tions, of which we have been at the
pains to procure a copy which lies
before us, is unanswerable to the
atrocity of the offence committed by
the beastly ANDERSEN. We cannot
give the evidence, because it is totally
unfit for publication in any other
paper than the EVENING NEWS.
We consider that a flogging law
is an abominable law, but that no
abuse of the law as it stands has been
made in ANDERSEN’S case. If ever
human beast wanted flogging,
ANDERSEN, drunken and devoid of
sense and decency, was such a man.
But we hold that society is not bene-
fited by flogging any man. By all
means, let the law be abrogated. But,
for mercy’s sake, don’t let excitement
swamp the public sense of decency
and reason, and cause a debased
blackguard to be foisted on to the
sacred pedestal which pertains to
heroes and martyrs.
BUSINESS - I
The Treasurer’s
Psychology
Getting near a boom?
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Mr H. HOLT
Delay paid off
k five per cent bond rate has been on
the cards for some weeks. Obviously
the authorities wanted to bring it in with
a bang on the eve of the Budget rather
than earlier, as mostly expected in
financial markets. In this way they aimed
to achieve the maximum psychological
impact on their dual fiscal and,monetary
policies.
The delay paid off. Not only did the
China Seas incident give a lightning
urgency to the need to fit a much bigger
defence effort into the economy, the
news of a record imports bill for July
and the worst trade balance result since
August last year also warned of possible
impending strains from the unbridled
appetite of the private sector for imports.
Two general motives were probably
uppermost in the Treasurer’s calculations
in lifting the bond and accompanying
loan rates. The first would be the need
to get a much bigger net contributioE
from internal loans to his cash Budget
than last year. One of his biggest
hurdles on the loan circuit is to get the
highest possible number of conversions
for the £2OB million of old loans redeem-
able on August 15. Another snag is
that the United States is still shut to us
as a borrowing ground for Government
loans.
With the whole emphasis of fiscal
policy directed to curbing effective de-
mand by clawing into the Treasury as
much excess income as possible before
it gets into the spending stream, it is
certainly healthy for the authorities tc
be relying so heavily on loans offerin'!
higher interest rates and thus minimising
the additional amounts that must be
raised by increasing rates of taxation.
The Treasurer’s other main motive in
lifting bond rate would seem to be tc
put upward pressure on commercial
rates, with the object of dampening pri-
vate investment. He has already pul
the squeeze on public investment by
giving the States considerably less than
they wanted at the Loan Council. For
while latest statistics and surveys, such
as the recent one by the Bank of NSW,
and also new issue activity on the Stock
Exchanges do not suggest private in-
vestment has yet reached boom propor-
tions, it can be taken from last month’s
record £116.3 million imports bill that
it is getting near it.

No Pipe of Peace
Over-production in tobacco
industry
FROM D. MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
/'Wer-production in Australia’s tobac-
co growing industry was brought
right into the open down here last week.
About 400 Italian share-farmers fro®
the Wangaratta district rioted after buy-
ers passed over the majority of their leaf


and concentrated on some from the
Ovens Valley.
The organiser of the protest, an agro-
nomist, Mr Mario Troisie, pointed the
bone at buyers from Rothmans and
Philip Morris (other buyers were God-
frey Phillips and W. D. and H. O. Wills)
as the chief discriminators. He claimed
the Ovens Valley tobacco was bought
because “big concerns” owned land there.
For them to succeed in an over-pro-
ducing industry, other farmers had to be
forced out of business.
Much was made of the fact that the
Philip Morris buyer, Mr J. C. Scott,
owned one-fifth of a tobacco-growing
company in the Kiewa district. He
strongly denied that this colored his
buying at all for the Philip Morris Com-
paoy-
According to the Italians, the whole
idea is to put them out of business before
the industry’s Stabilisation Bill comes
into action, if the Federal Government
accepts it. Although no one is prepared
to say much about the plans, it seems
that they will basically limit the produc-
tion of each producer to a certain
amount each year. It follows then that
the more producers who are sent bank-
rupt before the plans are instigated, the
more leaf each remaining grower will
be asked for under the Bill,
The buyers were up in arms at these
suggestions of corruption and brought
forward explanations for their actions,
First, the Ovens tobacco was better qua-
lity. Second, Victoria’s climate meant
its crop was sold last—when quotas were
nearly full and most buyers could be
very selective. A Rothmans director,
Mr D. Engela, made a special statement
criticising the demonstration because it
was pre-planned and could destroy any
proposed stabilisation scheme,
Who was right and who was wrong in
the whole argument is beside the point
anyway. The fact remains that the
tobacco industry is over-producing. Un-
til stabilisation is introduced many small
growers, with little financial backing
and possibly producing a poorer product,
will go out of business whether the “big
concerns” gang-up against them or not.
MIGRATION
Black Week for
Mr Opperman
Santanastaso case angers Italy
FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN ROME
Mr H. OPPERMAN
Black week
The last week in July was a black one
A for Immigration Minister Hubert
Opperman. The news broke first in
Italy’s second most influential daily, “La
Stampa”, of Turin, was taken up by the
major Milan paper, “Corriere della
Sera”, spread to the Rome Press and
received front-page treatment in Naples.
The weeklies followed suit, for the story
was too human and too incredible to
miss; Australia was refusing a visa to a
father who wanted to see his son.
The father, Pasquale Santanastaso,
sailed from Sydney in May last year
after signing an agreement that he would
not seek re-entry without giving his for-
mer wife 28 days’ notice. They had
divorced after seven years of marriage
which included 40,000 miles of racing
round the world in a contest over the
possession of their now seven-year-old
s °n. Santanastaso, a Neapolitan, won
two cases against his wife in Naples and
London and lost all in Australia. His
°ne aim in life is to gain access to his
son.
But in the last eight months he has
come across a new obstacle —refusal of
a visa. Canberra has been adamant,
but it is doubtful if the matter will lapse.
In 1960 the flight of Santanastaso’s
wife with the child from London was
facilitated by Australian authorities,
despite a court order against her. The
responsible Italian Press has now de-
nounced this as having been an “arbi-
trary concession”. The Minister’s refusal
of a visa is regarded as another arbitrary
decision to Santanastaso’s disadvantage.
Now the case has suddenly developed
from a domestic affair to a diplomatic
one; Santanastaso has the support of the
Italian Ministry for External Affairs, the
Italian Press, and public opinion.
There is talk of testing the Minister’s
decision in the Australian courts. And
there is renewed pressure for recipro-
city arrangements between Australia and
Italy when the Migration Agreement
comes up for ratification.
It is certainly bad news for Austra-
lia’s migration programme when Italians
read that a father is not allowed into
Australia to see his son, or at least to
attempt to gain access to him through
the Australian courts.
SPORT
Another Bash
at Boxing
But mothers needn ' t worry
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
A television sports commentator re-
** cently offered his public a film clip
of a savage fight “Sonny” Liston had
had a couple of years ago, and remarked
that it was something for “mothers
whose sons are thinking of taking up
boxing”. Perhaps he felt that some
justification was needed for showing
such an old bit of film, and in that pro-
cess handed boxing another black eye.
When sports commentators feel like
lashing out without risk of being hit
back, boxing is the most common patsy.
In this instance the remark came
strangely from a commentator recruited
from football, which causes more deaths,
injuries and spilled blood in Australia
than any other sport could ever approxi-
mate. I’ve read of five deaths this year,
mostly in “junior” or country football,
and in the country where the Liston
fight took place football’s annual toll is
more than 200 dead. Both of these are
figures to remember when boxing is
attacked.
I’m not sure what the commentator,
Rex Mossop, intended to prove by offer-
ing his bit of film as a warning to
mothers. Any fisticuffs their sons might
engage in at the Police Boys’ Club or
at school would hardly be in the world
professional heavyweight class of bruis-
ing. So the comment seemed a poor
jibe at one sport without reference to
others, by a man who was only a few
weeks ago admitting his ignorance at
most sports other than football.
Boxing is not a sport which begins and
ends with a few rounds in the ring. It
involves skipping, speed-ball work and
general exercises intended to develop
good timing and reflexes, a light muscu-
lar structure, good wind, and general
fitness. As an amateur sport, over four
two-minute rounds, it is excellent for
boys who might have a talent for it.
The point is that each youngster is
probably more suited to one sport than
to any others, and should be encouraged
to compete in that sport, whether it is
boxing, wrestling, judo, athletics, swim-
ming, or any of six dozen other possible
choices. The big mistake is to stop a
youngster entering the most suitable
sport for a reason which is yours (or
some self-appointed expert’s) and not the
youngster’s or to force the young into
sports which are not the best for them.


Tea at “The Swifts”
“But not to be compared with Lord Macaulay..."
By PETER HASTINGS
His Eminence waved a hand at the
crenellated splendor of The
Swifts. “I don’t necessarily like
living in such luxurious surroundings
but the house has been left to the Church
and if I reside here it saves £5OOO a
year in rates —a point sometimes over-
looked although I’ve made it several
times.” We walked around the drive to
the west side where the harbor glittered
distantly through Moreton Bay figs.
Here and there the stonework of The
Swifts is fretting. “And it’s expensive
to repair,” said the Cardinal with
resignation. “But it’s a solid house.
It’ll stand for quite a few generations.”
He pointed to a row of ground-floor
windows through which a priest could
be seen sitting in a seat. “That was the
ballroom, the largest outside Govern-
ment House, I'm told.” Had he seen
the ballroom at Raheen which Dr Man-
nix had turned into a library? “We did
better than that,” he said shortly, “we
turned ours into a public chapel. Many
come here.” He glanced with mild dis-
taste at the huge block of home units
which towers above The Swifts on the
south side and then back at The Swifts.
“The ancient and the modern.” He
gestured towards the units. “There’ll be
much more of that sort of thing before
we are through. But come inside and
talk.”
The interior of The Swifts is vast and
cold, a memorial to the late Mr Resch’s
starkly Gothic tastes. The rooms are
dim; immense carpets in the entrance
hall scarcely cover the chill, marble floor;
cedar abounds in a gloom of doors,
lintels, mantelpieces, tables, claw - leg
chairs and in the balustrade of a grace-
ful staircase above the bend in which,
as desirable as water in a desert, a single,
stained-glass window glows confidently.
A scarlet biretta lay on a brass tray on
a small table. We entered the dining-
room, dominated by a huge centre table,
and sat in comfortable arm-chairs near
a corner desk on which stood a solitary
telephone. An ornate Louis XV clock
stood on a carved mantelpiece. Several
disagreeable china steins stood silent
tribute to the great fortune which found-
ed the house.
The Cardinal’s health? “Excellent,
thanks be to God. I see my doctor from
time to time who tells me I am in good
shape.” He sat relaxed in scarlet-edged
soutane, scarlet zucchetta faintly irides-
cent in the pale afternoon light, his
pectoral cross reflecting an edge of the
window frame behind us. Looking at
him it was hard to realise that he has
been Archbishop of Sydney for 24 years
and a member of the Sacred College for
18.
His broad face is pinkly, frankly Irish,
and he does not look his 68 years. He
smiles a lot but his private smile is
spontaneous and quite charming. His
accent is Irish Australian, its tone and
finish mildly ecclesiastical. He uses the
words “wonderful”, “beautiful” and
“lovely” to describe a variety of things
from people and occasions to sentiments
and The Swifts. He is naturally
courteous, anxious to understand and
anxious not to be misunderstood. He
has an unexpectedly good sense of
humor which can be occasionally ironic
as in his sly description of the late Arch-
bishop Kelly telling his coadjutor: “. . .
Archbishop Sheehan, the great scholar
you know, that ‘he ought to keep up
with his reading'.” Irony again when one
said that despite studibus enquiries he
had proved elusive. “Me?” he asked,
sharply precise, “or my character?”
And again when he explained that Aus-
tralian religious affairs come under the
Propaganda office, because of Australia’s
missionary beginnings, while Britain
comes under the Consistorial office.
“One might have thought England a
more missionary country,” he said
quietly. At other times he is merely
humorously self - deprecating. When
pressed for his golf handicap he re-
luctantly admitted, “I’m not good enough
to have one.” But often his humor
is anecdotal. Thus of Dr and Mrs
Gough, whom he greatly likes: “We sat
near each other at dinner on one
occasion and Mrs Gough was plucking
at her husband’s wrist to gain his atten-
tion. Dr Gough finally looked at her
and then to me in mock resignation and
said, ‘I know that the cultivation of for-
bearance is a Christian virtue but at least
you don’t have a wife to reckon with!’ ”
The subject of an interview with His
Eminence had been touchy. It should
not touch on political or other matters.
It was to be a personal conversation
taking us where it would, but not, one
felt, into the private fields of his piety,
for example, which leads him to prayer
for many hours daily before the Blessed
Sacrament. Or to a discussion of his
monastic sense of duty which will cause
him to leave a Saturday afternoon foot-
ball match in order to hear Confession,
like any other priest, at St Mary’s. And
in turn there was his general dislike of
interviews, his genuine detestation of
personal publicity. He was, then, a
modest man? “I do not know that that
is altogether true!” And a patient one?
A sudden flash of irony. “Ah, but in a
sense that is all I have to do, exercise
patience.” But he is patient and modest
nevertheless. One gets the impression

of a somewhat lonely man, still slightly
astonished that he has come so far and
reached so high. His family had possessed
no “social status”, he said, and his grand-
mother had even successfully opposed his
ambition to become a Marist Brother at
13. “It was social I think. Many Irish
families could not bear the thought of
a son trying for the religious life and
failing.” But all that was long ago, like
his life in Lismore, his student days at
the Urban College in Rome whose
Rector, the scholarly Giobbe, was
created a Cardinal after Gilroy. It was
now 18 years since his mother had told
him at breakfast that a neighbor had
heard on the wireless that Archbishop
Gilroy had been created a Cardinal.
“What nonsense you talk,” he said to his
mother, “what will you think of next!”
But if modest, he is also extremely
conscious of the state of his office and
its never-ending responsibility, an office
which he describes as “humbling”. A
sudden flash of his smile. “But I am
helped on all sides. The clergy,” he
brought his hands together, “are mar-
vellous. And the bishops are wonderful,
they give so much, so generously. But
in the end it is I who must make
decisions and take the responsibility.”
The responsibilities are greater in num-
ber and magnitude than those which his
predecessors faced, especially the prob-
lems of raising money. “But God is so
loving,” he brought his hands together
again, “He is so good to us that I no
sooner find one door closes than another
opens. I am helped on all sides and by
so many.” One of the many is un-
doubtedly Sir Robert Menzies whom His
Eminence holds in high regard. Partly
it is due to the Cardinal’s regard for
leaders, it would seem, in jurisdictions
other than his own. He respects authority
and when it is combined, as in the
Prime Minister’s case, with a great and
impressive personality, His Eminence is
apt to be warm in praise.
Slim the caged tiger
“T think history will probably record
A Sir Robert Menzies as the greatest
Australian. Such a forceful, intelligent
man. He has such a beautiful speaking
voice, too. He is a lovely speaker, so
witty. I deem it a privilege to know him.
I often reflect how well served we are by
the leaders of our country. How lucky,
for example, in our Governors-General.
Lord De L’lsle is a most charming and
gracious man with a real grasp of
things here. He is also most thoughtful.
Only the other day he sent me a
biography of Florence Nightingale which
I found most interesting.” And Slim,
of whom it had been said that his talents
were too great for his job, that there
was something of the caged tiger about
him? His Eminence was judicious.
“That is a very good description in many
ways . . . very good. Perhaps the most
delightful of all our Vice-Regal rep-
resentatives was Lord Duff—Lord Dun
—, the man who was Mr Morrison, the
Speaker of the House of Commons. So
much charm and generosity and a most
lovely voice with a Scots accent . . .
beautiful. I loved listening to him. I
think we are better served by men from
England, don’t you? It is no insult to
Australians to say that our Crown rep-
resentatives come from England with
fresher minds, a fresher outlook. They
come from ah, yes, Dunrossil, that’s
the name they come from a bigger
world than ours.”
There was a discreet knock on the
door and a sister of Our Lady Help of
Christians wheeled in afternoon tea com-
prising toast, scones and cake. It was
enormous. “Good afternoon, Sister, and
how are you?” asked His Eminence.
“Well, thanks be to God.” The Cardinal
turned to me. “Sister belongs to a con-
fraternity which looks after The Swifts,
St Patrick’s College and Archbishop
House at Manly and St Columba’s Col-
lege at Springwood. Somehow they’ve
brought order into this place. I don’t
know what we should do without them.”
She looked pleased and disappeared
2fter setting one end of the dining-room
table. “We’ll sit at table,” said His
Eminence, “it will be easier to eat and
talk.” We sat facing the enormous spread
of food and drinking tea. “Talking of
good speakers,” said His Eminence, “did
you ever know Billy Hughes? No?
There was a magnificent speaker. He
had a beautiful voice and a very great
sense of humor.”
I said that I had only one personal
encounter with Hughes. As a young re-
porter at the war’s end I had covered a
ceremony at Hyde Park where Mr
Hughes had made a speech. When the
ceremony was over he had fussed and
fussed at an aide standing nearby.
“Somebody’s stolen it. I know they
have,” said Hughes. “Stolen what?”
asked the flustered young man. “Stolen
my bloody umbrella, that’s what.” His
Eminence smiled fleetingly. “Ah, yes. I
seem to remember that Mr Hughes was
an umbrella maker once.” He took a
piece of toast and ate it carefully. “I
met a good many people when I was
Secretary to the Apostolic Delegation,
and, of course, later. I always thought it
a great privilege to know people who
were leaders in various walks of life.
I still do.” Had he known Chifley or
Curtin or Scullin? “I did not know Mr
Curtin who was, they say, rather an
aloof figure. Mr Chifley was a figure
of great authority, in a quiet way. I
remember meeting Mr Scullin once and
finding him more of a man in the street,
if you know what I mean. None of them
compared with Sir Robert who is a
towering figure.”
Latin with an American accent
HThe Cardinal’s descriptions often con-
tain a precision of observation, a
saving and sometimes witty insight, that
rescues them from being merely official.
Pius XII was gracious, charitable, much
maligned and . . . unexpectedly: “A shy
man, I think. Paul VI is the same.” Of
Ottaviani, reputedly the arch-reactionary
of the Council, he said merely: “He
speaks the most beautiful Latin I have
ever heard.” Of Suenens, whom journal-
ists have made the shining knight of the
progressives: “It's all nonsense. On some
issues he is more conservative than Otta-
viani.” And in answer to a clumsy ques-
tion as to the principal difference be-
tween the American and European Cardi-
nals: “The principal difference? The
Americans speak Latin with an American
accent.”
As there was an Irish, American and
English College, for example, why not
an Australian College? “And transplant
Australia to Rome? We would prefer our
students to attend the Urban College and
bring a little of Rome back with them.”
He did not. then, believe that the Church
was overdominated by Rome, the Italian
Curial Cardinals for example? “I do not.
It is all very well to talk of reducing the
number of Italian Cardinals but they
have the experience and expertise. They
fit into the administrative machine of the
Church, they understand the political and
social life about them. Most Australian
priests are pastoral in outlook and would
find the Curial life uncongenial.”
And finally, after thought, in answer
to the question which single experience
of his life stood out above all others,
he replied simply, “. . . arriving by train
at a railway station, the name simply
stuck there on a board —JERUSALEM.”
It had a tremendous impact, he said,
like a book read long ago and never for-
gotten. Since he had mentioned books
had he read either “The Cardinal” or
“The Shoes Of The Fisherman”? He was
short and to the point. “I have read the
former, which is modelled on Spellman,
but not the latter.” Did he read very

much? “Fiction hardly at all now. But
I read, when Lean, biographies and auto-
biographies, books about God’s noblest
creations, men and women. Three bio-
graphies in recent times have impressed
me. One was the biography of Joseph
Smith, the founder of the Mormons . . .”
His Eminence pursed his lips and looked
towards the window. “A scarcely credible
story. Almost unbelievable. Another bio-
graphy, kindly sent to me by Lord De
L’lsle with a most gracious note, which I
greatly enjoyed, was the life of Florence
Nightingale, a most remarkable woman,
such strength of purpose and will and yet
all her activities directed towards the
highest and noblest of aspirations.” The
highest and noblest of aspirations one
might suppose to be true; other
biographers had taken a rather different
view of her motives, that she could do
nothing else, that ... “Ah, yes, but
think of all she achieved,” said His
Eminence firmly, “against what odds, of
how she managed, of the great circle of
influential friends she created. I found
her friendship with Dr Manning most
extraordinary, for example. I read a
biography of him, too, not so long ago.
A most interesting man but not as con-
genial to you, I think you said earlier,
as Cardinal Newman?” One preferred
Newman’s “silver veined prose”. “Yes?
Newman was a fine writer, of course, but
not to be compared, I think, with Lord
Macaulay.”
Outside it was getting dark. “Before
you go let me show you the billiard
room.” His Eminence led the way to a
vaster and chillier room than I had yet
seen. A huge, repulsive stein stood in
a far corner. The billiard table stood
on monstrous claw-legs. “Notice the
legs, the craftsmanship. And that,” he
said pointing, “is the electric score-
board. Mr Resch attended to every-
thing.” We emerged again in the huge
entrance hall. “You should see the
drawing-room, too, the furniture, the
fittings, the carpets are beautiful.” It,
too, was huge and cold. “And this.”
The Cardinal moved agilely to a small
Moorish alcove, its powder-blue walls
and ceiling faintly dusted with gold
stars. It glowed like a jewel. “Lovely,
isn’t it?” We were in the entrance hall
again. An ornately-carved grandfather
clock struck five sombrely, and a young
priest emerged. “This is Dr Burns, my
private secretary, who will drive us back
to town.”
The gleaming city
f)N the gravelled pathway outside stood
a gleaming black Rolls-Royce. Dr
Burns put it into gear and we made
a stately turn. “It goes with the house,”
said the Cardinal, smiling, “so, of course,
we use it.” I asked Dr Burns if he
liked it. “It’s a fine car,” he said, “but
rather heavy.” “Heavy on petrol, too,”
said His Eminence quickly. On the way
back to town the Cardinal talked firmly
and precisely on various subjects.
Athenagoras had hit it off with Paul as
he had with John. The Anglicans were
at last learning something of Catholic
doctrine and through the Greek Ortho-
dox Church at that the Eastern door,
as it were. Immigrant assimilation
was a great problem for the Church.
Some immigrant nationals by their cultu-
ral and social background were prepared
to do too little for themselves and de-
pended far too much on the Church for
aid and help, not that aid and help were
not forthcoming, but still . . . And then
there were the Eastern Rites immigrants,
the Uniates, who had their special prob-
lems. “We have Maronites and . . .” he
turned to Dr Burns, “Melchites, too,
Father? Ah, yes, I thought so. Yes, their
priests marry but we discourage that here
as it is not understood.” But the national
record of assimilation was good on the
whole? “Jolly good!” The antique
affirmative carried conviction. At the
top of William Street the neons were
flashing red and green. Twin streams of
traffic extended down the hill. In the
distance the T & G tower impaled
the brick-red winter dusk. “Isn’t it a
beautiful view?” The Cardinal’s right
hand, holding his scarlet biretta, ges-
tured towards the city - archdiocese
which had once been the Vicariate
Apostolic of New Holland. “So much
vitality!”


OUT AND ABOUT
“Lord of the Flies”
on a Shoestring
From civilisation to savagery in a long weekend
By PETER BROOK
(who directed the film of the William Golding novel)
Sam Spiegel, one hand covering a
sore eye, trod water and a beach
ball splashed between us: he had
bought the rights of “Lord of the Flies”
and it was in a crowded pool in Monte
Carlo that he had called the first story
conference: “What are we going to call
the film?” he asked. In a terrible flash
the coming year opened up and I saw
down a long perspective of frustration:
I now knew we would never agree on a
single thing.
If Golding’s book is a potted history
of man, so the story of the making of
the film is like a condensed history of
the cinema, throwing up all the snares,
temptations and heartbreaks of the diffe-
rent levels of production.
Kenneth Tynan first gave me the
novel: I laid it down so determined to
make it into a film that I could hardly
believe the news that Ealing Studios had
bought the rights from Golding for
£2OOO and already had a director hard
at work. But cynical friends in the Eal-
ing organisation reassured me. “There is
a pattern in this,” they said. “We will
never make it. We will discuss it, prepare
it, scripts will be written but in just about
a year someone will realise that it’s far
too risky and that'll be that. You’ll see.”
I stood by, anxious, doubting, while
the process ran its predestined course. I
heard disturbing rumors that Nigel
Kneale had written a brilliant script, that
a location had been found on the Barrier
Reef, that casting was under way. Then
one day a budget was made and some-
body had to decide whether an exciting
project about a lot of kids was going to
be a sound investment of £200,000. It
is hard to blame them for deciding it
was not.
The rights of “Lord of the Flies” were
now for sale, and their price had risen
to £lB,OOO. When I heard this I rushed
to Sam Spiegel. Here I made a psycho-
logical miscalculation that was going to
cost me dear. I proceeded on the assump-
tion that being an old friend Spiegel
would be prepared to take a remote
paternal attitude to a small experimental
venture. Going on the theory that, if I
kept the budget sufficiently low, he would
give me a free hand, I misgauged the
essence of the Hollywood-formed pro-
ducer’s success.
The big-time producer can only oper-
ate by identifying himself totally with
anything he is involved in and so
inevitably has to come to blows with
the European-style director who works
on the same principle himself. Orson
Welles had said to me once when I
nearly made a film with Hecht and Lan-
caster, “Never work with a producer at
the top of his success” and I ruefully
remembered his words.
All I wanted was a small sum of
money, no script: just kids, a camera
and a beach. All the producer wanted
was a detailed screenplay which would
guarantee him that the film had “world
values” before any big money was spent.
For a year we seemed to go through
the motions of production: an Art
Director searched Spain and Africa: I
went to the Canary Islands: we inter-
viewed children, Peter Shaffer was en-
gaged to write a script, and, simultane-
ously, in secret, Richard Hughes was
commissioned to write a rival one. (He
lives on a hilltop in Wales and I often
wonder if anyone has ever told him the
fate of his version.)
Shaffer and I lived intensively the
lives of conscience-torn Hollywood in-
tellectuals the whole anatomy of
compromise was laid bare. I remember
at the start Shaffer asking, “How on earth
can we possibly agree to change the
title, turn the boys into girls, the English
into Americans?” I replied with the
rationalisation, “Supposing we had never
heard of Golding, and someone came
with a proposal to make a film about
a group of boys and girls of mixed nat-
ionality stranded on a desert island.
Couldn’t we make a new and exciting
story out of that?”
Shaffer wrote a remarkable six-hour
epic: there was a giant trek up a mount-
ain and an extraordinary sequence lasting
nearly an hour, in a cave, in which I
remember three complex rituals playing
at once, each of which would have
served a whole season of the Theatre of
Cruelty. But the mixture of Shaffer and
Golding, with Spiegel and myself pulling
in opposite directions, was too indi-
gestible.
However, Spiegel now had a budget
made and when he saw that with his scale
of operating it came to £500,000, he did
us the true service of abandoning the
project. Another year had passed and
“Lord of the Flies” was on the shelf
again.
A young American called Lewis Allen
was, meantime, exploring a new idea in
New York. He felt that private backers
could be found, who would be interested


in each putting up a thousand pounds
or so, for a film and would have no
excessive anxiety about losing the lot.
He and his partner, Dana Hodgdon, had
just financed the film of “The Connec-
tion” this way, and they offered to do the
same for “Lord of the Flies”. Of course
we now had to negotiate for the rights,
and the price was now cut down to
£50,000, plus a third of the producer’s
profits. Our budget was £BO,OOO, so, by
the time we had concluded the deal, we
had spent over half our capital on the
rights, which must be some sort of
record.
However, our final script was suddenly
worth its weight in gold. On the strength
of this document, some 200 Washington
backers felt they were dealing with a
reputable proposition. Fortunately, in
their remoteness from show business they
were not aware of the one key question
that any film backer would put how
can you guarantee that the film will ever
be completed?
Bitter experience all through the world
has led once-bitten financiers to develop
a self-protective system so they insist
on approving schedules, checking budgets
and on the strength of these they insure
and guarantee completion. We knew that
we could make no budget, as the sum
we could raise was clearly not going to be
sufficient; we could make no schedule,
as everything to do with the children was
fraught with uncertainty.
In France, feature films have been
made for £lOO. The £lOO gets you
through the first day’s shooting. By then,
enough wheels are turning to get you
through the second day and soon you
have enough to show to justify credit
for going on a bit longer. Our only
question was how to get to the point of
no return.
A kind of Billy Bunter
|°|ne day an assistant I had in New
York called Mike Macdonald came
to me, very puzzled. “What’s this name
Billy Bunter you’ve told me to quote?
I go to see an English businessman in
his office in Manhattan and I tell him
we’re looking for English boys on this
side of the Atlantic. He’s unfriendly,
stiff. I’m wasting his time. No, he can’t
help. Sorry, old chap, not my line. Then
I say ‘We’re looking for a kind of Billy
Bunter.’ There’s a complete change. He
sits back, chuckles, pulls out his pipe.
From then on nothing’s too much
trouble.”
We had worked out that we could
not possibly afford to bring our boys
from England and decided to search for
those British who had already got to the
States at their own expense. Macdonald
stood on the docks and accosted likely-
looking families as they set foot on
American soil. He loitered outside the
circus, he wrote to the Embassy families
in Washington, he found in the New
York telephone directory an Old Eton-
ians Club, an Old Harrovians Club and
even one of the Old Boys of Mill Hill.
We traced an entire Scottish village,
moved intact by a distillery to New
Jersey. I suppose we saw about 3000
children, all anxious to be in the film,
with parents ardently keen on the novel
and glad to have a quiet summer with
the children taken off their hands. There
was no pay—only some pocket-money
and a share one day of hypothetical
profits.
Ralph, the leading boy, we found in
a swimming pool in an Army camp in
Jamaica, just four days before filming
began; and as for Piggy, he arrived by
magic through the post a sticky Just
William letter on lined paper, “Dear
Sir, I am fat and wear spectacles,” and
a crumpled photograph that made us
cry out with delight. It was Piggy, come
to life in Camberley the unique boy
himself, conceived ten years before at
the very moment that Golding was wrest-
ling with the birth of the novel. What
act preceded which? The philosophical
question intrigues me to this day.
We had found an island off the coast
of Puerto Rico a jungle paradise
miles of palm-fringed beaches owned
by Woolworth’s, who lent us the island
in exchange for a screen credit. We had
resolved to institute rigorous economies
everywhere. No one was allowed to fly
except on the late-night cut-price fares;
no one could phone New York, hire a
car, stay at a hotel if buses, writing
or shacking with friends could do in-
stead. As a result we saved thousands
of dollars and were in a position to say
that two things would be unrestricted,
one was the care of the children, the
other was the wastage of film.
We ended with 60 hours of unbroken
screening and a year’s editing also
miles of tapes recorded at all moments
of the day, out of which the dialogue
was eventually glued on to the film like
postage-stamps, word by word. This was
not an ideal technique, but it was the
only technique open to us, and in a
sense this was our completion guarantee.
The book is a beautiful fable so
beautiful that it can be refuted as being
a trick of compelling poetic style. In
the film no one can attribute the looks
and gestures to tricks of direction. Of
course, I had to give the impulse to set
a scene in motion, but what the camera
records is the result of chords being
struck on strings that are already there.
The violent gestures, the look of greed
and the faces of experience are all real.
It is said that all children can act.
This is not really true. It is like the myth
that all Negroes have rhythm and big
bass voices. Children go to greater ex-
tremes. If a child can act, he can often
act divinely, but when he is bad, as the
nursery rhyme goes, he is horrid.
The children, before we started, were
thrilled at the idea of being “in a film”
although none of them knew at all what
this meant. I think they imagined they
would climb up inside a screen and there
they would find life moving at that mar-
vellous tempo where all the dull portions
of existence are edited away. It was a
truly shocking experience for them to
discover that filming is just the reverse,
long hours of doing nothing, waiting
dressed in blazers and woollen socks in
the tropical sun repeating the same
thing again and again.
Descent to savagery
contact with Golding’s harsh
A material was much less significant.
People always ask me whether the child-
ren understood and what effect it had
on them. Of course they understood:
Golding's thesis is that all possibilities
are latent in every child and they had
no difficulty in seeing that this is true.
Many of their off-screen relationships
completely paralleled the story, and one
of our main problems was to encourage
them to be uninhibited within the shots
but disciplined in between them.
Even the wise and calm Piggy came to
me one day close to tears. “They’re
going to drop a stone on you,” the other
boys had been telling him. “That scene
on the schedule, Piggy’s death. It’s for
real. They don’t need you any more.”
My experience showed me that the
only falsification in Golding's fable is
the length of time the descent to sava-
gery takes. His action takes about three
months. I believe that if the cork of
continued adult presence were removed
from the bottle, the complete catastrophe
could occur within a long weekend.
Still, when the final reckoning was
made it was clear that the children had
been the least of our problems. They
had worked loyally and well for three
months and grumbled far less than the
grown-ups. Unexpectedly, it was the
adults who could not stay the course:
we were continually being joined and
abandoned by enthusiastic intellectuals
whose wish to help rapidly withered
away.
In the end there were just three of us
left who set sail for France with our
cans of film and tape. The money had
run out, but a Paris laboratory was
giving us credit —and as I write this
phrase I am beginning to believe that it
was all a romantic and exciting adven-
ture. But a fading memory of the truth
still lingers. It was awful, most of the
time.


At the Drop of a Digger Hat
4 Science now there’s a subject with unlimited potentialities for humor”
By CHARLES SRIBER
“T aughing at a problem can become a
" substitute for doing something about
it. That’s why I’m very careful of satire.
It often has the effect of pushing the thing
you’re satirising under the bed —some-
times it even helps it grow.” The speaker
was London-born, bearded Michael
Flanders, in Australia with his American
wife and 2F-year-old daughter as ad-
vance guard of the Flanders and Swann
comedy duo.
Their carefully almost gently
barbed, brand of humor is very, very
British. But they confounded the prog-
nosticators by taking their show to the
United States and playing 12 months at
the same theatre on Broadway and fol-.
lowing that up with a successful 12
months’ tour of the North American
continent. “Of course we soon included
some American allusions,” Flanders said.
“I’m hoping to do the same here. That’s
why I came so early to look at the local
scene.” They open in Melbourne late
in August and Donald Swann will be
coming just before that date.
Flanders is the non-piano-playing
member of the act, although he has lec-
tured on music and written the libretti
of two operas as well as translating Stra-
vinsky’s “The Soldier’s Tale” for the
1954 Edinburgh Festival.
He performs from a wheelchair, fol-
lowing a polio attack in 1943 during
service with the Royal Navy. “I find
that after a very short time the audience
forgets about the wheelchair. We make
a great effort to find rapport with the
audiences. The success of our work de-
pends on how audiences react and we
often change our material accordingly.”
Inlanders began appearing before audi-
ences when, as student at Westminster
School, he was evacuated to Lancing.
Another pupil of the school was Donald
Swann and the two of them wrote and
produced a school revue. “We called it
Go To It’. Later, I went to Christ
Church, Oxford, played with the OUDS
and made my first professional appear-
ance at the Oxford Playhouse in Shaw’s
‘You Never Can Tell’.”
After being invalided out of the Navy,
Flanders turned to radio. “I was ten
years with the BBC. They had me
broadcasting on whatever ghastly head-
line was currently occupying the front
Pages of the Press. I also broadcast
every night on the European services.”
Besides his political and world com-
mentaries, he chaired the Brains Trust,
wrote revue material and provided much
of the material used by Joyce Grenfell.
During this period he once again met up
with Swann.
“Donald had been driving an ambu-
lance for the Friends’ Field Service in
northern Greece,” Flanders said. “He’s
a confirmed pacifist—always has been.
Donald’s very fond of Greece. He’s in-
troduced a Greek song into the act.”
Although they provided material for
others, they had never considered per-
forming themselves. We used to do a
bit at private parties, and the inevitable
happened. People suggested we put it
on professionally. We weren’t so sure,
but finally opened at the little Lindsey
Theatre in Notting Hill Gate. It was so
successful we were transferred to the
Fortune Theatre in the West End and
the show ran for 21 years.”
Their American success followed, after
which they returned to Britain where
Swann wrote an opera based on C. S.
Lewis’ “Perilandra” and Flanders played
in the Royal Shakespearian Company’s
production of “The Caucasian Chalk
Circle”. “I see you’re doing it here in
Sydney. But they tell me my part —the
part of the narrator —has been cut out.”
The success of their first show, “At
The Drop Of A Hat” prompted a second
which they called “At The Drop Of
Another Hat”. This ran at the Hay-
market Theatre for six months.
“We’ve culled what we hope is the
best of both shows for our Down Under
tour, although it’s going on under the
first title.”
Flanders wheeled himself close to the
window of his hotel room and looked out
at the view over Rushcutters Bay. “I’ve
done my homework on Australia and
we’ll try and get in some locally inspired
material. We had a girl in London
looking after our baby. She came from
Sydney and told us all about bodgies
and surfies. I was a bit worried about
our references to the Commonwealth.
When we talk about it we mean the
British Commonwealth. Here I under-
stand it refers to Australia. But our
girl told us few Australians talk about
the British Commonwealth; they still
refer to it as The Empire.”
T suggested that the girl might have
A grown a little remote, that “bodgie”
was virtually obsolete and, in fact, few
Australians still believe in the Empire. He
considered this and agreed that he should
keep an ear attuned for local terms of
reference.
“I usually balk at the suggestion that
we are satirists. Ours is a more gentle
parody,” he said. “Although sometimes
we don’t get the results we seek. We
had a song about corporal punishment.
It went something like . . . ‘Bring back
the cat, the thumbscrews, the knout . . .’
It appeared to be going over very well.
Then we realised the British audiences
were taking it all very seriously. That
wasn’t what we had intended at all. So
we had to drop it. But I think being in
radio so long has helped with contem-
porary material. I’m pretty used to
making old scripts sound new.”
At this point, slim and very blonde,
Mrs Flanders joined the conversation.
“Have you ever thought of taking them
off? I mean all the frustrations of the
radio studio. There must be a wealth of
material there.”
Michael Flanders considered this.
“You might have something,” he con-
ceded, “but we’d have to be careful. I
don’t like humor based on ignorance.
Now science—there’s a subject with un-
limited potentialities. I think C. P. Snow
made a good point when he said that a
man needed to be able to understand the
law of thermodynamics before he could
consider himself educated.
“Decimal currency is another fertile
field. Particularly applicable here too.
But mostly we concentrate on the humor
arising from all the little frustrations that
plague us everyday . . . frustrations like

fixing a fuse and all the other complica-
tions.”
“That’s because you try to sublimate,”
Mrs Flanders commented.
I asked whether he dealt with bigger
issues.
“I think we do. We sing animal songs,
only they're not about animals. Then
we have a song called the Honeysuckle
and the Columbine. Two vines that
creep around each other for support. I
suppose that’s indirectly a reference to
racial relations.
“Of course there are plenty of current
issues in Britain. Nobody there ever talks
about the Empire. That all died with
Suez. Suddenly we were confronted
with Britain invading another nation
while nobody in charge could say
whether we were at war or not. If you
came onto the streets to protest you were
beaten by the police. It split the coun-
try. I think Britain was closer to civil
war at that time than most people
realised. Anyway, it spelled the end of
the Empire types.”
Did he attend meetings?
“Not very often. Igo to Equity meet-
ings and attend political meetings at
election times. Donald's the political
one. He’s president of a small Pacifist
Labor party that’s actually contesting
two seats at the general election. Of
course, they haven’t a chance, but it’s
Donald's way of protest.
“I suppose my only election stint will
be speaking in support of Tony Wedg-
wood Benn. He's a great friend of ours
and I think he'd make a fine Minister.”
Madras, Summertime
“Next time . Everybody says next time”
By VICTOR DEAN
Last night we went to a cafe for
dinner. It seems a reasonable thing
to do on occasions, especially for
the sake of the children. It takes them
away from the tropical routine, from
the monotony of mealtime at home and
from the sweat-induced bickering be-
tween them. It lifts them, somehow, into
a new world and momentarily their eyes
become wonder-filled wide as their hori-
zon is lifted beyond the humdrum of
everyday.
So, because of the constant stickiness
of the skin-oozing sweat and the salty
grime which always collects around your
mouth and neck and armpits unless you
sit immobile under an old-fashioned
ceiling fan, we chose an air-conditioned
restaurant, one of the few in this dust-
filled city. And the children’s pallid
faces, skins prickly - heat - peppered,
flushed with pleasure as they burst un-
ceremoniously through the door into the
dimly lit cool of what is, in reality, a not
very grand restaurant. But to them it was
wonderful. The chandeliers (of cheap
glass), the table flower decorations
(artificial and plastic), the patterned
floor carpet (path-marked by the tread
of many feet) and the tables themselves
(sparsely set, yet shining with the starch-
ed whiteness of what was actually clean
table linen, and the toothpicks on the
table), were all commented on in the
shrill and unembarrassed treble of child-
hood.
Comments uninhibited and unhushed
by the whispered and frantic parental
injunctions to be quiet, brought smiles of
amusement to the faces of some of the
few diners. Those whose dignity was dis-
turbed by the children’s unceremonious
arrival, turned to stare at them with that
adult condescension which seemed to
imply a horror of noisy children and,
even more, a disdain for the parents of
such unrestrained offspring. The waiters,
I think, did not understand the children’s
English, and smiled benignly at them
with vague, absent-minded smiles, while
all the time placing and replacing the
cutlery and table napkins which had
looked quite straight in the first place.
It could have been anywhere in the
world, that restaurant, except perhaps
for the excess of dark faces and the
pleasing swirl of saris. We were shut in,
insulated from the rabble millions, unfed
and uncouth, in the city outside. Madras
no longer existed, nor did the tropical
summer, nor yet the grime, the river-
induced stink or the malnutrition.
The children enjoyed it; so did we.
The menu, neither a gourmet’s dream
nor yet over costly, listed a large variety
of foods Indian, Chinese, European.
The cost of each dish was plainly
marked. The children are embarrassingly
honest at such times. The waiters wait;
the other diners interrupt their con-
versations to stare; some splutter over
their coffee. But this is life, this is fun
a night out! Let the children enjoy them-
selves.
Before long it is time to go. The meal
has been a happy one, laughter-filled.
For that hour we have not thought of the
sultry heat outside, and for the moment
it seems that it could not exist, even out-
side. I fear that our exit was followed
by unsatisfied stares. We had had a good
meal, not too expensive, and we had
left a reasonable tip, but waiters some-
how always make you feel you should
have left more. Yet they do a job and do
get paid for it. How much? No matter,
it is a job and they can also collect the
tips. Many, many in the crowds outside
would give anything to have their jobs,
even without any tips at all, so why
shouldn’t they be satisfied? But you can
feel the stare at your back as you go out.
Suddenly the stifling, heat - stilled air
makes you want to retreat, but you can-
not go back. The meal is over, the night
nearly done. It’s time to go home.
“No; go away!”
“QJahib, Sahib, baksheesh, baksheesh!”
And you look down. I think he
must have had leprosy; his hands were
deformed, so were his feet and ankles.
He could not stand, but could only
shuffle along on his knees. And he knelt
there, then shuffled along after us,
maimed hands outstretched, “Baksheesh,
master, Baksheesh”. Arms and hands
flailed the air, like the ineffectual pawing
at the air by a pet poodle sitting begging
for food. But this was not party man-
ners; this was no cute trick of a pampered
pet; these were hands grotesquely de-
formed pleading “Baksheesh, master,
Baksheesh!” The horror momentarily
makes you say, “No; go away!” Why
should anyone have to beg like this,
anyway; why can’t he leave you alone?
And someone else sidles up, tries to
help open the car door; murmurs “I’m
poor, master; children hungry; bak-
sheesh, master; I’m poor, sahib; hungry,
master.” Curtly you thrust a coin into
the maimed paw of the leper and an-
other into the grasping hand of the
beggar; irritably, and only a very small
coin.
But you are not away yet. You go to
the other side of the car. Another youth,
a mere boy, rushes to open the door for
you. “Open your car door, Sir? Bak-
sheesh, master.” But you spurn him; slam
the door in his face. “Can't give to every-
one,” you think. And you say, “Next
time; will give you something next time.
I just gave money to the others. You
next time.” Bitterly resigned eyes lift to
yours; fate-filled eyes. “Next time,” he
says, “always next time. Everybody says
next time. All the time it’s next time”.
And as you drive away he follows, until
the car’s speed leaves him, dust laden,
behind.
The children are still happy; quietly,
silently happy now. You drive home. But
still you hear that voice, “Next time.
Everybody says next time.” And that
other voice, leprous, raucous, persistent,
“Baksheesh, master, baksheesh.” And
still you see those hand-deformed arms
paw the air. And you have to live with
your own pettiness.

Adrift in an Anti-Intellectual Society
“The basic attitude is Mid-Victorian 99
By CHARLES HIGHAM
After only six months here —as
Australia’s first Professor of
Italian (at Sydney University)
Frederick May, former head of the
Department of Italian at Leeds, has, in
newspapers and on TV, already made
bis mark as a pundit, and as something
of a scourge. And in conversation in
a coffee-house, talking with a startling
celerity, he kept neighboring tables agog
with his driving radicalism.
What did he think was behind the
Australian book censorship he disliked
so much? “A certain immaturity and a
residual anti-intellectualism. You can see
the dragged-out residual attitudes to
intellectuals in the attitude of the police
on Commemoration Day.
“And with this residual anti-intel-
lectualism you have the feeling that doxy.
certain highfalutin’ pieces of writing
should not be available to an elite. And
so you see the correlation —the censors
keep the elite books out of the hands of
the elite.
“And you see the same thing in the
attitude to libraries. The Government
will not advance sufficient funds for the
increase of knowledge through books.
Australia and this is a tragedy —has
no library of any stature whatever. I
feel sorry for my kids at Sydney. They
haven’t got *2 of a chance of getting a
book. There are 850,000 volumes in
the Fisher. There should be three million.
Everything should be a subject of
debate. But when you have no tradition
of debate you have a situation which
tends to produce a conforming ortho-
Some of my friends say this
refusal to debate is due to the ghetto
areas of lower Catholicism. I myself
would put it down to a fundamentalist
attitude. And 99 per cent of the re-
pression is political.
“But you can trace it back to the
family, too. Parents won’t discuss things
in front of their children. The basic
attitude is mid-Victorian here. It’s modi-
fied not by any literary considerations
but by the sheer pressure of an outdoor
life . . .
“Last summer I saw girls in the street
in those becoming shifts looking ex-
tremely provocative, those admirable
bosoms, those splendid behinds . . . and
all behaving as though they were
wrapped in yards and yards of bomba-
zine . . .
“So you see two things operate here.
On one side a residual anti-intellectual-
ism, and on the other an attitude 150
years out of date towards morality.”
And how were things, comparatively,
in England? How did the Professor feel
about Malcolm Muggeridge’s suggestion
that the decline in English morale was
rather like the Fall of the Roman Em-
pire? “Well, that’s probably because he’s
a lapsed Catholic.
“But, you see, things actually are much
more enlightened in England.” Apart
from moral restraints, had anti-intellec-
tualism also miraculously faded away
there? “Well, partly. Things are im-
proving all the time.
“There has always been a strong tradi-
tion of debate in England, which there
hasn’t been here. I should like to see
Leaving Certificate students here dis-
cussing, say, the homosexual agony be-
tween two of the characters in ‘The Mer-
chant of Venice’.” And was this kind
of thing really discussed at GCE level
in England? “Oh well, no, I must admit
not. But it’s coming more and more
there in Adult Education Classes. Aus-
tralians have got to stop pretending
that life consists of a nice little woman,
a nice little man and nice little kids in
a nice little house.”
And how was this position to be
changed? “Through satire —that’s the
best weapon—which is why I deplore
these attacks on ‘Oz’ and ‘Tharunka’.”
Did Professor May find hope in the folk-
singing-cult? “Oh yes, there’s the chance
that when these young folk-singers have
children of their own they’ll teach them
a more enlightened attitude towards
open discussion.”
And on that note of optimism, he con-
cluded.

TWO TICKETS TO NEW ZEALAND-ONE FOR HALF THE NORMAL FARE!
It’s the Qantas “Wife Vacation” Plan. Works two ways.
Your wife gets the holiday she’s been longing for. You get
the savings (and the holiday, too). And, if you’re travelling
to New Zealand on business, what could be better? Still
only one full adult return fare while your wife vacations
along with you for half the return air fare. It’s the kind of
surprise she’ll hug you for —say “No wonder you’ve got
tickets on Qantas!” Take other members of the family, too!
Again, just the one full return adult fare—your wife and
everyone under 26 years of age travels for half or less (under
12 only 35% of the adult fare; under 2 only 10% of the
normal adult return fare). You can fly from Melbourne or
Sydney on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays for holidays
up to 17 wonderful days. And
with Qantas Credit Travel you
can plan your whole holiday
for a mere 10% deposit. Come

Hona Kong Newsletter
The War in Vietnam I.
Hotting up the guerrilla conflict at least
From STANLEY KARNOW in Hong Kong
For all its sound and fury, the initial
Chinese reaction to the American
bombardment of North Vietnamese
naval bases is considered cautious and
somewhat ambiguous, according to diplo-
matic analysts here. Asserting that the
US had “gone over the brink of war”,
Peking radio on Thursday warned that
“the Chinese people will not sit idly by
without lending a helping hand” to
protect North Vietnam from “aggres-
sion”.
But such phrases, with their ominous
forebodings of “grave consequences” if
US armed provocation “does not cease”,
are effectively no different from past
Chinese responses to the threat of an
expanded Vietnam war.
By contrast, the Soviet reaction is
regarded as unusually strong. The
official Moscow statement called the
American action an “open and hostile
act”, warning that further “rash steps”
could lead to “broad armed conflict”.
Interpreting the divergence in tone be-
tween Peking and Moscow, diplomats
note that proximity to the scene of crisis
is a significant factor.
The Chinese must exercise restraint
lest they be challenged to translate their
words into deeds. On the other hand,
the Russians can speak more vigorously
because they face less risk of involve-
ment in what, at worst, might degenerate
into a conventional rather than nuclear
conflict in Asia'. Moreover, the strength
of the Soviet statement is seen here as
setting the mood for diplomatic negotia-
tions ahead and not Russian military
moves, as both the Soviet and American
delegates to the UN Security Council
have agreed that the North and South
Vietnamese representatives should de-
bate on the crisis. The plan to discuss
the issue at the UN has further frustrated
the Chinese, who are not members of
the world organisation. The forth-
coming debate, they have charged, is
an American scheme “to whitewash its
crimes of aggression”.
Perplexing
1%/leanwhile, diplomatic and military
specialists in the Far East are trying
to piece together the events that led to the
crisis, and many admit that the elements
in the story are perplexing. At the base
of the crisis, it is generally agreed, is
the worsening situation in South Vietnam
which last month motivated Premier
Nguyen Khanh to advocate attacks
against the North.
Despite American efforts to dis-
courage him, Khanh amplified his aim
to enlarge the conflict. On July 23 the
South Vietnamese Air Force Com-
mander, Commodore Nguyen Cao Ky,
declared that the war could not be won
without strikes against the North “and
even Communist China s '. Though South
Vietnamese officials privately acknow-
ledged their lack of capability to escalate
the war without American participation,
Saigon propaganda reportedly created an
atmosphere of tension in North Vietnam.
Travellers recently in Hanoi have
described an acceleration in building
air-raid shelters and trenches, and the
North Vietnamese themselves reported
an increase in anti-aircraft batteries
around the city.
Communist uneasiness was reinforced
by Washington’s announcement that
several thousand more American advisers
v/ould be sent to Vietnam. These men
were earmarked for the “pacification”
programme within the South, but it is
believed that Hanoi interpreted their
forthcoming arrival as a sign that the
war would be intensified and perhaps
enlarged. Premier Khanh’s campaign to
attack the North, combined with the ex-
pansion of the US Air Force, is con-
sidered to have frightened Hanoi. The
air and coastal harassments by the South
Vietnamese that had been going on for
months and years were, in the newly-
charged atmosphere, seen as perhaps the
prelude to a more generalised attack.


Until this week, the North Vietnamese
1 bad made no attempt to retaliate against
■ the US vessels of the Seventh Fleet for
harassing actions. But after South Viet-
namese ships reportedly shelled islands
jn the North Vietnamese provinces of
Nyhe An and Thanh Hoa on July 30,
Communist torpedo boats attempted to
! sink the US destroyer Maddox patrolling
the Gulk of Tonkin. That first encounter
was written off in Washington and else-
where as an “isolated incident”. What
is highly puzzling, however, is why the
North Vietnamese patrol boats returned
on the stormy night of August 4 to
, attack American destroyers for the
second time. So far Hanoi has not
mentioned the second attack. Peking
today called it a “myth”, describing it
as “sheer fabrication ... by US Im-
perialism in order to extend the war”.
American ships in the Tonkin Gulf are
; energetically searching for survivors of
the two Communist boats sunk to prove
that the action did indeed occur.
US no “paper tiger”
Deen from here, the rapid American
destruction of 25 North Vietnamese
boats —more than half of the Communist
patrol force has had two immediate
effects. First, it demolishes the Peking
propaganda that the US is a “paper
r tiger” and may, in Hanoi, strengthen
the influence of Mr Khrushchev, who
has repeatedly warned the North Viet-
namese against provoking the Americans.
) Secondly, on the American electoral
front, it has bolstered President John-
son against Senator Goldwater’s claims
that the administration was timid. In •,
some quarters here, the US attack on
the land installations after the sinking
of the patrol boats is regarded as a
j, political rather than strategic operation.
Most observers here believe that
unless the Chinese make a military move
—an eventuality considered doubtful at
this point—the crisis will be carried to
| the conference table. And, having dis-
played its strength, the US may be in a
‘better bargaining position if the debate
turns into a settlement of the whole
Vietnam situation. At the same time,
analysts see some worrisome develop-
ments in South Vietnam. Premier
Khanh is currently moving troops into
positions near the 17th Parallel. And
(there is a fear he may use the present
j cris ' s as a signal to launch his advertised
/ attack on the North.
i Equally dangerous, Khanh’s troop
movements are creating vacuums in the
South that can be easily filled by the
Communist Viet Cong. This could lead
to further deterioration of the guerrilla
War and, paradoxically, reinforce Khanh’s
claim that marching north is the only
w ay to win. (ofns.)
New York Newsletter
The War in Vietnam—2.
" The nation remains calm " - not to say bored
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
(TMIHERE is something remote and un-
real about the Vietnam crisis that
erupted so suddenly last week
with President Johnson’s dramatic
midnight television appearance disclosing
the retaliatory air strikes on North Viet-
nam bases in response to PT-boat at-
tacks on American destroyers in the
Gulf of Tonkin. Just as suddenly the
crisis seems to have subsided, with the
destruction of 25 hostile torpedo-boats
and the bombing of their bases at Hon-
gay, Loc Chau, Phuc Loi, Quang Khe
and the petroleum storage dump at Vinh.
Grim-visaged Defence Secretary Robert
McNamara has been
appearing on the TV
screen daily and
nightly from his
Pentagon offices,
briefing reporters in
remarkable detail on
the efficient progress
of the American
naval and aerial re-
sponse to the impu-
dent enemy attacks
and the build-up and
beef-up of American forces in the
trouble areas.
But it is as though we have all been
watching television spectaculars about a
fictional Far East situation, and not tele-
vision newscasts. One’s mind and atten-
tion were caught but one’s emotions have
not been engaged. “The nation remains
calm in face of the Far East threat,”
the newspaper headlines tell us, with
absolute accuracy. The nation is much
more concerned with the state of the
pennant races in baseball or even the
Presidential election campaign just get-
ting under way.
This might prove to be a lull before
a storm and might change at any
moment, with a crashing counter-thrust
from North Vietnam or, heaven forbid,
from the ultimate enemy, Communist
China. But for the time being the strange
episode seems to have come to an end.
The man in the street, the all-knowing
New York cab-driver, and the newspaper
pundits were equally at a loss to explain
what it was all about.
The reactions from the Communist
camp, notably the official statement by
the Peking Government, were entirely
predictable in accusing the United States
of unprovoked aggression against North
Vietnam. Despite the remark that the
United States “had gone over the brink
of war”, official circles in Washington
were not alarmed. Reconnaissance re-
ports indicating no Chinese troop move-
ments or aerial activity in North Vietnam
were reassuring. Observers in Hong
Kong considered Peking’s statement to
be a relatively restrained document.
There was a feeling in Washington that
China was not yet ready to commit itself
to “lending a hand” to North Vietnam
through armed retaliation against the
United States.
President Johnson’s decisive moves, in
sending American forces into action and
taking his case to the Security Council
the very next day,
made a favorable
impression on this
country’s allies. Only
France, as expected,
remained aloof from
the general chorus of
approval, taking the
familiar line that if
Washington had only
listened to General
de Gaulle the whole
thing would never
have happened. De Gaulle has been ex-
erting pressure on Washington for months
to call a top-level conference of all
nations concerned in the Vietnam strug-
gle, including Communist China, to
achieve that neutralisation which the
General believes to be the only solution.
In the Security Council, Mr Stevenson
asserted that acts of deliberate aggression
could not deter the United States from
helping “our friends preserve their own
opportunity to be free of imported terror
or alien assassination managed by the
North Vietnam Communists based in
Hanoi and backed by the Chinese Com-
munists from Peking”. He added that
the United States retaliatory bombing of
North Vietnamese torpedo-boats and
their facilities was authorised not only
by international law but by the United
Nations charter itself. Britain’s repre-
sentative, R. W. Jackling, supported this
statement, pointing out that Article 51 of
the Charter recognised the right of self-
defence against armed attack, pending
action by the Security Council to main-
tain international peace and security.
But the American recourse to the
United Nations was obviously taken
more for propaganda purposes than in
any real expectation of action by that
body. As Secretary-General U Thant

immediately made clear, in a White
House visit the day after Mr Stevenson’s
presentation of the American position,
the Security Council was powerless to
achieve a settlement of the dispute. Mr
Thant pointed out that North Vietnam
was not a member of the United Nations,
nor was Communist China.
United Nations circles were struck by
the mildness of the Russian reply to
Mr Stevenson. Platon Morozov, the
Soviet representative, warned that if the
United States repeated its military acts,
“it will have to bear a heavy responsi-
bility.” These were mild words indeed,
considering the Russian reputation for
thunderous denunciation of “capitalistic,
imperialistic aggression.”
Mr Morozov called upon North Viet-
nam to supply the Security Council with
“the necessary information relating to
the United States complaint” and send
representatives to the Council. This was
very far short of Communist China’s
charges of “over the brink of war”.
The Russians acted as though they
were as much in the dark about the
motivation for the North Vietnamese
torpedo attacks as anyone in the Capital-
istic camp. Communication between
Moscow and Peking has seemingly dete-
riorated to the vanishing point.
Following Ambassador Stevenson's
presentation of the United States case,
the Security Council adjourned until the
end of this month. At that time it was
expected that both North and South
Vietnamese representatives and pos-
sibly the Red Chinese would be on
hand to participate in the scheduled
debate. Meanwhile the United States was
expected to push its plan for a United
Nations Force to be sent to South-east
Asia. Last May Mr Stevenson told the
Security Council a “UN presence” in
that region, even with limited responsi-
bilities and powers, would be supported
morally and financially by the United
States. Secretary-General U Thant is
said to be sympathetic to the proposal,
but he also favors a Geneva meeting
first, to bring about a political settlement
of all South-east Asia questions. He has
frequently stated that in his belief the
UN is powerless to impose a military
solution until a political solution is first
agreed upon.
Shift in US policy
\ merica’s call for UN participation
represented a considerable shift in
policy, since this country previously had
tended to look upon South Vietnam as
principally an American responsibility.
The Congress of the United States has
closed political ranks, in this election
year, and given the President firm sup-
port in his acts as Commander-in-Chief.
Only a minority, headed by Senator
Wayne Morse a member of the Pre-
sident’s own party took the view that
the air strikes ordered by the President
constituted a Pentagon-State Department
plan to “escalate” the war in Vietnam.
Memories of the Cuban crisis, the
“eyeball to eyeball” confrontation be-
tween Kennedy and Khrushchev and the
consequent Russian withdrawal of its
missiles from Cuba, are still fresh in
Washington. That crucial episode prov-
ed that the Communists respect force
and proved a turning point in American
relations with Russia. Peking taunted
Khrushchev at the time for yielding to
the threats of a “p a P er tiger”.
The prompt American use of force in
the Gulf of Tonkin and lack of military
response by Peking may indicate a reali-
sation that the tiger might be made of
sterner stuff than paper. The strong
American retaliatory action against
North Vietnam by air does not by any
means forecast stepped-up land warfare
with increased American participation.
General Nguyen Khanh has threatened
for some time to attack North Vietnam


even without American consent and con-
ceivably might feel encouraged to do so,
in the light of events of the past week
in the Gulf of Tonkin.
However, President Johnson specific-
ally restricted the retaliatory action to
the targets successfully attacked.
President Johnson’s action as Com-
mander-in-Chief is bound to have an
effect on his political role as candidate
for re-election. His prompt use of fotce
against a Red foe has taken some of the
sting out of the “soft towards Com-
munism” charges of the Goldwater
camp. There is room for suspicion that
the President may have acted with undue
haste in going before the country at
midnight to announce an attack was in
progress.
Actually the attacking planes had not
left their carriers and were not in action
for more than an hour and a half after
the President went on the air with his
dramatic announcement. It could have
been that he wanted to make sure a
large television audience would hear his
words. If he had waited until the planes
had struck or reported back, most people
would have been in bed. To a veteran
like Lyndon Johnson the political pos-
sibilities of the critical situation may not
have been paramount but they certainly
were present in his mind.
At the same time his summoning of
Barry Goldwater by telephone from his
yachting holiday in California to inform
the Republican candidate of the contents
of his statement and to obtain his en-
dorsement, constituted an unusual tribute
to the Senator from Arizona. It certainly
enhanced the prestige of the Republican
candidate to be consulted in such a major
move. It is not yet the moment to assess
the political effect of the Vietnam crisis,
now seemingly subsided, but still a threat
to the peace of South-east Asia where a
war would upset all political calculations
concerning the November elections.
Saigon Newsletter
The War in Vietnam—3.
Commencing 1946 - a non-stop , continuous horror film
From DENIS WARNER in Saigon
(By special arrangement with “The Melbourne Herald”)
South from the twin cities of Saigon-
Cholon, with their French colonial
buildings and boulevards of trees,
Route 4 runs like a ribbon of asphalt
through the rice and vegetable lands
of the Mekong delta. It is the trunk
road from the capital to the delta
granary with its eight million to nine
million peasant farmers, and for the
first few miles hoardings by the road-
side advertise cigarettes, liquor, clothing
and cars. On either side the peasants in
their black homespun pyjamas and
conical straw hats work through the
daylight hours in the bordering fields.
Small boys ride back and forth on grey
and lumbering water buffalo. A heron
stands poised daintily on one leg.
The first effect, in short, is of peace.
The flooded delta has the appearance of
a shallow lake in which Route 4 and
the other main roads have become cause-
ways and the larger towns and villages
islands in a sea of inundated rice. Hun-
dreds of hamlets now have no access
roads of any sort. Others cluster along
the wooded banks of the serpentine
canals, half a day’s canoe trip from the
nearest district authority.
Anywhere, at any time, the peaceful-
ness of this scene is likely to be violently
shattered. Traditionally, this is the time
°f year when the Communist Viet Cong
build up their reserves and extend their
bold in the delta, driving the road-bound
Government forces back into the towns
and the security of higher ground. This
year has been no exception. The water
heightens the allusion, of course, but
never has Mao Tse-tung’s analogy of
guerrillas living like fish in an ocean of
peasants been more agonisingly apt.
In flashing raids, the Viet Cong rip
and tear their prey only to vanish unseen
into the ocean of peasants from whence
they came. The Government forces cast
blindly into the waters and almost always
miss. Major dragnet operations with
many battalions catch sprats: the big
ones get away.
To conventionally trained Western
soldiers plunged into Indo-China, this
Communist revolutionary warfare is a
mixture of black magic and sleight of
hand, shocking, fascinating and quite
impossible. It was asking too much of-
a St Cyr graduate to expect him to
believe that a peasant army largely
dependent on stolen French weapons and
lacking almost all the accoutrement of
modern warfare could pit itself success-
fully against an expeditionary force of
a quarter of a million men built around
the elite of metropolitan France.
During the long, grim years of the
Indo-China War, in a score of officers’
messes over uncounted bottles of
Algerian wine, I heard the plea for a
set-piece battle. “Just let us meet the
Viet Minh once in a conventional battle
and we’ll inflict such a defeat that they’ll
never want to fight again,” the French
used to say until they got their set-
piece at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Even
then nobody could quite believe that it
had happened, or that the bamboo and
sandshoe army which appeared out of
the paddy fields to take over Hanoi from
the departing French with their tanks,
armored cars, artillery and aircraft had
really fought so well with so little.
The Americans inherited the military
wreckage left by the departing French
in 1954 convinced that the Indo-China
War was not what it was said to have
been. It was widely assumed that the
French had fought badly, if at all. That
the French forces had lost something
like 94,000 killed in action was un-
believable. All the accumulated French
knowledge, so bitterly acquired, was
ignored.
As American military aid began to
arrive in substantial quantities, the
Military Aid and Advisory Group began
to knock the hotch-potch of Vietnamese
forces left over from the Indo-China
War into an effective-looking but entirely
conventional army, oblivious to the
advantages of moving on its feet, depen-
dent on elaborate motorised columns
for its supply and on aircraft and
artillery for close support. Its role was
to guard the borders: for coping with
an internal insurgency situation it had
neither the means nor the know-how.
Misplaced optimism i
I>y mid-1959 the Americans in Saigon
were so pleased with its progress that
Major-General Samuel L. Myers, who
had just completed his tour of duty as
deputy-chief of the aid and training
mission, reported that Communist in-
surgents were no longer a threat and
that two territorial regiments reinforced
occasionally by one or two army regi-
ments were enough to cope with their
depredations. The American Embassy
went so far as to recommend a reduction
in military aid.
Since there were no police at any level
lower than the district capital, no
centrally-linked administrative apparatus
in the hamlets and villages and no rural
intelligence system other than hit-and-
miss operations conducted on a purely
personal basis by the province chiefs,
this blissful ignorance was not surprising.
When, brutally and dramatically, sub-
version turned into insurgency within
months of the Congressional hearing, the
immediate reaction both by the Diem
Government and by the Americans in
Saigon was that the North Vietnamese
had invaded. By the time it was appreci-
ated that the Viet Cong uprising was
much more difficult to cope with than
a conventional invasion, two years had


passed and South Vietnam was all but
lost.
Even now it was thought that just a
little American stiffening, a little more
training and a little more equipment
would be enough for the task. As late
as August of last year a top American
general gave me nearly two hours of
his time on a strictly confidential basis
to explain that the Viet Cong had passed
their peak and were about to go into a
rapid decline. The mobility of the Viet-
namese forces, scooting across the paddy
fields in their amphibious tractors, or
descending like eagles from their heli-
copters, was enough to prevent the con-
centration of more than platoon-sized
Viet Cong forces in the vital Mekong
delta, he said. The strategic hamlet pro-
gramme was going great guns and soon
the Viet Cong would be isolated from
the civil population as effectively as the
Malayan Communists had been isolated
from the Min Yuen civil help group
during the Emergency. On the High
Plateau and in the rugged Annamite
Chain things were even bleaker for the
Viet Cong. Special forces were now
hunting them down along their own
jungle trails. Short of food, reinforce-
ments and supply, their situation was
little short of desperate.
“Strategic hamlet” fiasco
T)ehind Washington’s talk of vigorously
** carrying on the war is the bitter con-
viction by many here that it cannot now
be won. It may not be lost, but it can-
not be won. If that is the case, so the
rationalisation goes, it was always foolish
to expect a clear-cut solution, and it is
enough now to hold on. Those who up-
hold this theory also seek comfort in the
conclusion that because of helicopters,
air support, amphibious tractors, and
the rest, there can never be an American
Dien Bien Phu.
If by a Dien Bien Phu is meant the
sort of shattering military victory that
the Viet Minh won through a single
battle, this is almost certainly true. But
there are many other things that the
Viet Cong can do, and are doing, short
of putting all their 45 regular battalions
together for one blow. There could be
political and psychological Dien Bien
Phus, and it is idle to pretend that there
may not be.
This was not dishonest. The general,
who had once commanded West Point,
believed what he was saying. But just
as the dynamited remains of a con-
creted French lookout tower within a
broken square of twisted barbed wire
used to be the symbol of blasted hopes in
the Indo-China War, the silt-filled moat,
the gapped bamboo fence and the aban-
doned' blockhouse of the “strategic
hamlet” are now the desolate remains of
his optimism.
In principle, the “strategic hamlet”
scheme was sound. In implementation it
was a fiasco. Instead of beginning in
more or less secure areas and working
out slowly and patiently into regions
where the Viet Cong were known to be
more active, province chiefs won
Brownie points under the Diem regime
for speed. If the hamlets had become
rural prisons, which with some province
chiefs was certainly the intention, they
could scarcely have been more dismal.
Offering little or no protection against
Viet Cong incursions, they often be-
came targets for Government air and
artillery attack when the Viet Cong took
them over.
Peasants resettled within their bamboo
palisades were supposed to be compen-
sated for abandoning—often at bayonet
point their thatched huts and fruit
trees. Instead of receiving compensa-
tion, however, they almost always found
themselves obliged to perform forced
labor without pay. By day Government
forces dragooned them into building
hamlet fences. At night the Viet Cong
came and drove them to pull the fences
down. Local defence forces and visiting
Government regulars behaved like para-
sites, stole their chickens, pigs and rice,
or commandeered them at rates far
below the market price. Arbitrarily and
and inequitably they imposed, and with
force they collected, heavy local taxes
and “contributions” to the “strategic
hamlet” programme.
Instead of clearing a “white” area
around Saigon, the original intention of
the “strategic hamlets” programme, the
Diem regime by its excesses drove the
people in these provinces into the arms
of the Viet Cong. Lon An Province,
which runs south and west of Saigon,
is one of the worst in the entire
country today. Beyond it is Kien
Hoa. A Vietnamese-speaking team of
Americans conducted an intensive
survey of secondary school children
here early this year. Their report
was shattering. “If it is meaning-
ful to use the word ‘collapse’ in the case
of a province where at least 70 per cent
of land and population alike are already
under Viet Cong control, or in areas of
Viet Cong ascendancy by day, what is
left of Kien Hoa Province shows signs
of being close to the brink of a potenti-
ally disastrous collapse of both popular
and cadre morale,” the team reported.
A new-old tactic
"Oy day Route 4 is reasonably safe for
30 or 40 miles. By night the Viet
Cong have it. The provincial and district
capitals are insecure islands in a surging
sea of Viet Cong. “When I stand with
my two feet on the ground like this, I
can tell you we hold it,” said an un-
usually frank Vietnamese colonel, plant-
ing his heels firmly in the soil. “When I
do not stand like this it is more correct
to say that the Viet Cong hold it.”
About half of the Viet Cong’s 46
identified and elite regular battalions are
stationed in the delta. North and west
of Saigon, centreing on Tay Ninh,
where the Cao Dai have their temple of
dragons and purple plaster and get
messages by planchette from Victor
Hugo, one of their favorite saints, there
are another nine battalions. A third
force of significance, together with two
regimental headquarters and the only
identified Viet Cong general, Major-
General Nguyen Don, is in Quang Ngai
and provinces close to the 17th Parallel
which divides the North from the South.
Until this wet season Viet Cong
military operations, though widespread,
tended to be relatively small. Rarely
had the Viet Cong used more than a
reinforced battalion, or five hundred
men, in a single operation. They seemed
much too respectful of counter-attacks
from helicopters to risk major battle con-
centrations.
Beginning early in July, however,
there was a marked change in the size
and severity of the Viet Cong assault.
All through the dry season the Viet Cong
had been perfecting a new-old tactic
borrowed straight from the game of
Vietnamese chess. It calls for an overt
feinting attack covered by a well-con-
cealed ambush.
The move from the chess board to
the battlefield began with section attacks
against isolated Self-Defence Force or
Civil Guard posts on the perimeter of
hamlets, or guarding bridges with per-
haps a company held in ambush posi-
tions, and worked up into company, and
even reinforced, battalion attacks and
ambushes.
One classic manoeuvre took place in
the delta not long ago when the Viet
Cong launched simultaneous assaults
against a post held by thirty-eight Civil
Guards and a nearby watchtower
manned by seven members of the Self-
Defence Corps. News of the attacks
went by radio to the district chief, who
had one Civil Guard company available
to send as a relief force. His first prob-

Runway Project:
fTV) accommodate the larger, faster and heavier jet liners
of the future, the runways at Sydney Airport are being
lengthened. Part of the contract for this undertaking has
been awarded to A. Bradshaw (Excavations), a unit of
Brambles, and work on the project is well under way.
Bradshaw units working on the site have to break down
a quarter-mile length of heavily reinforced concrete sewerage
structure and remove over 12,000 cubic yards of material
before construction of the new runway can commence.
Swift Materials Handling:
At two hours’ notice, CHEP in Sydney were asked to
“ ri ‘ unload two huge computers from a jet airfreighter
about to land at Sydney Airport. Speed was the essence
of the job because the plane had to fly out on a tight
schedule.
CHEP rushed out a heavy fork lift truck with specially
extended forks to handle this cargo. Swiftly and safely the
computers were taken from the belly of the giant jet, lowered
to the ground and sent on their way to a Government Depart-
ment in Canberra. The unloaded plane took off again on
schedule.
The computers weighed 80,000 lbs. and were valued at
£2,000,000. It’s believed that the load was the largest ever

Personnel of both companies will take
up their positions with the new company
within the next few months. Until such
time as new premises are completed, all
the existing services of both companies
will continue to be available from their
present addresses and through their
existing telephone numbers. In future
the combined fleets of equipment will be
painted in the familiar “Brambles Red”
and will carry the Brambles name.

EXPORT ACTION
Port Cartage in Newcastle
Aids Major Industries
Newcastle, at the mouth of the
Hunter River and at the dis-
patch end of the rich Hunter
Valley, has rarely been busier
than in this good export year of
1964. Brambles Industrial Services
in Newcastle are heavily com-
mitted in this sector of Australia’s
Export Action.
Coke for Noumea
A short time ago, the Newcastle
Gas and Coke Company
Limited sent abroad the biggest
shipment of coke ever to clear
Nobby’s Head — 7,000 tons of it
in the one consignment. B.I.S.
men and machines (see picture
below) worked around the clock to
cart the coke to a mechanical
loader for hoisting - aboard the
S.S. Chilean Nitrate. Destination
was Noumea where the black
cargo will be used in the produc-
tion of nickel.
The growth of demand for in-
dustrial cartage in Newcastle has
prompted Brambles to put a new
fleet of Mack B 61 Tippers on
the road for heavy duty. This will
augment the existing fleet. Drivers
have been specially selected for
experience, skill and safe driving
records.
Heavy Clip Goes Away
wool brokers held
1 five sales between January
and July and auctioned 217,000
bales to world bidders. The
greatest part will leave Australia
through the Port of Newcastle for
woollen mills overseas. Brambles
vehicles are constantly occupied
with the cartage of bales.
The wool is first taken from
brokers’ stores to dumpers’ stores
where bales are compressed and
strapped to conserve shipping
space. The last step is delivery
to shipside where the wool goes
into the slings, down into the holds
and away to export customers.
Manning River
"Goes Bulk"
Coldvert Vats Ordered
T'he dairying industry of the region
A will benefit from the decision of the
Manning River Dairy Farmers’ Co-opera-
tive to commence conversion to bulk
milk collection. Already preparations
are well in hand for the improvement
of access roads to farms and the instal-
lation of refrigerated vats for milk
storage.
The Manning River Co-operative
Society in Taree is one of the largest
Dairy Co-operatives in N.S.W., having
400 suppliers.
The Coldvert Refrigerated Milk Vat
manufactured by W. G. Pickrell — a
unit of Brambles — is among those
recommended by Directors to the mem-
bers of the Co-operative, and has passed
all tests with flying colours.
The initial supply of Coldvert Vats
ordered for Taree is under manufacture.
Each Vat is thoroughly tested before
placement in the field, to ensure trouble-
free service.

Mr. Frank James Cann joined Brambles
Newcastle on 19th July, 1919, and retired on
19th July, 1964 — an unbroken service record
of 45 years. He was engaged in workshop
supervision. During the war years he earned
a reputation for ingenuity in overcoming
shortages of parts to keep the trucks moving
for the industries in the Newcastle area.
Mr. Harold Wilkinson, Industrial Transport
Foreman, also of Newcastle, retired after 25
years’ service. He enjoyed the complete
confidence of both men and management.

lem was whether to divide his relief
forces, his second whether to send any
relief at all, since his own surveillance
system reported an ominous lack of
normal traffic moving in the general
direction of both actions.
His decision was to use Ml 13 armored
amphibious carriers, thus avoiding the
possibility of a road-side ambush. This
was just what the Viet Cong had antici-
pated. The Ml 13s drove across the rice
fields straight into a horseshoe-shaped
ambush and came under heavy attack
from 57 mm recoil-less rifles. One
Ml 13 was set afire and burned along
with its seven occupants. Viet Cong
fire also damaged four other carriers
and prevented the relief column from
reaching the Civil Guard post, or the
watchtower, which had already been
destroyed. In their own good time the
Viet Cong broke off the operation and
dispersed. They were not followed.
The Viet Cong are patient. If a relief
column does not show up quickly, they
are prepared to wait for it. In Kien Hoa
Province, two full Civil Guard com-
panies waited a full day before going
to a hamlet that had come under attack.
For maximum security, they chose
separate routes to approach the hamlet.
The Viet Cong staged two ambushes.
The first ambush pinned down one com-
pany, the second wiped out the other.
Viet Cong victories
Tn February, when a reinforced bat-
A talion of Viet Cong attacked a series
of hamlets near the Cambodian border,
dug into walls of the hamlet moat and
told the villagers that the Government
could come and take them if they
dared, Saigon felt that it had a ready-
made opportunity to show its military
superiority. By the time the point
platoon of its attacking forces had been
wiped out in its entirety and napalm
canisters, aimed at the moat, had set
alight to one of the hamlets, with heavy
loss of civilian life, the Government
forces had a change of heart. The Viet
Cong withdrew under cover of darkness
after 36 hours, unharried and un-
pursued.
This bold challenge to the Govern-
ment forces to come and fight has been
repeated many times recently, usually
with bloody success. On July 10, for
instance, the mud-walled little fort of
Vinh Cheo with a garrison of only 46
men came under attack in the province
of Chuong Thien in the southern Mekong
delta. Vietnamese authorities in Saigon
had been pleased with the way things
were shaping in Chuong Thien. Many
of the peasants in the province are fol-
lowers of a faith-healer named Hnynh
Phu So, founder of the Hoa Hao sect,
who was executed years ago by the Viet
Minh. Under the Diem regime, the Hoa
Hao preferred the Vet Cong as the
lesser of two evils: with Diem’s death
last November they began to rally to
the Government’s side and in Chuong
Thien the Viet Cong found their civil
support wavering. It was with reason-
ably high spirits, therefore, that the
province chief despatched the first relief
column to help the defenders of Vinh
Cheo.
By nightfall no fewer than five com-
panies of militia had been cut to pieces
by two regular Viet Cong battalions
operating from ambush positions on the
way to and around the port. Next day
4th Corps commander committed two
regular battalions with artillery and air
support. Before they pulled out under
cover of darkness the Viet Cong had left
more than two hundred Government
troops dead and wounded.
A week later the Viet Cong repeated
the tactic, and in the same place. First
came the feinting attack against Vinh
Cheo. A helicopter flying at 30 feet
over the rice gave the all clear to the
waiting Government relief column.
There were no Viet Cong waiting in
ambush positions, it reported.
Reassured, a Government battalion
started to make its way along the road
to the post. “Suddenly the rice got up
and ran,” said the American helicopter
pilot who had flown over the road on
reconnaissance. While machine - guns
took the battalion under cross - fire,
heavily camouflaged Viet Cong infantry-
men, rice sheaves over their heads and
shoulders, ran across the paddy fields to
administer the coup de grace. The Gov-
ernment forces turned and fled to take
cover in a nearby swamp. But here a
second Viet Cong battalion was waiting.
This time the Government suffered an-
other two hundred casualties, mostly in
killed and missing.
With the delta water-logged with the
monsoons and aflame with ambushes like
this, the Viet Cong have also taken the
initiative in the long-quiet provinces im-
mediately south of the 17th Parallel.
Here, also, the Viet Cong no longer
hesitate to hit the tardest Government

targets. Well aware that Government
reserves in this region are scanty, the
Viet Cong co-ordinate and scatter their
attacks so that the harassed army com-
manders and their American advisers
sometimes find themselves with all
reserves committed before the main
thrust can be identified.
This occurred in the early morning
of July 6 when four simultaneous Viet
Cong battalion attacks in the Ist Corps
area and two other simulated attacks
of similar size cleared the way for a
major assault on a Special Forces post
manned by 600 elite Vietnamese rangers
and a dozen American and Australian
advisers. The Viet Cong failed to over-
run the camp but they forced its aban-
donment, which was their purpose.
The Viet Cong are everywhere and
nowhere. The static Government forces,
guarding hamlets, villages, towns, roads,
railway lines and bridges, are sitting
ducks, but the Viet Cong just cannot be
found. For the month ending mid-July
the Government forces launched 190
battalion - sized operations and more
than 30,000 small unit operations. Only
240 made contact.
Unheeded advice
angry frustration which made the
French yearn for a set-piece battle and
led to punitive air and ground operations
has its precise counterpart in this war.
American advisers counsel against in-
discriminate attacks, against brutality
and heedless violence and against listing
dead and unidentified Vietnamese pea-
sants as members of the Viet Cong.
Their advice is not always taken.
The prophylactic use of air power and
artillery is one by-product of frustration.
At an exposed battalion headquarters
one day I found that its perimeter
defence included four 155 howitzers
pointing north, south, east and west.
As for air activity, the first sentence of
the three-page operational summary for
July 15 tells the story: “Special air war-
fare activity reached a new high for the
month today as fighter-bombers of the
Vietnam Air Force, directed by forward
air control observation aircraft, struck
Communist Viet Cong concentrations
from the southern Camau Peninsula to
the jungle hills of the northern frontier
with bombs, high explosives, rockets and
automatic cannon fire,” it read. Any-
thing, and nothing, are targets now.
Hearsay reports about Viet Cong con-
centrations are everywhere the signal to
call in planes, or artillery, for un-
observed fire. Night and day the big
guns are used: just like firecrackers to
scare off devils. It would be better for
the Government and its hopes for win-
ning over the population if it threw every

New pacification plans, “new life”
villages for the “strategic hamlets”, “oil
stains” that spread out from the “white”,
or more or less Viet Cong free areas into
the Viet Cong dominated regions are all
fine in principle and full of the humane
understanding that this war cannot be
won with guns alone but only by bring-
ing welfare to the villagers. But military
commanders, desperately short of re-
serves, almost inevitably draw on troops
from pacification areas when they are
hard-pressed. When the troops go, the
Viet Cong return.
When an action is over, the guns have
stopped firing and the weeping villagers
are laying out their dead and sorting
through the smouldering ruin of their
homes, it is difficult as an observer not
to curse this war and all that perpetuates
it. Since Christmas, 1946, it has been
going on, with only a change of leading
players between the acts, its every action
a grim re-run of everything that has
gone before, a sort of continuous non-
stop showing of an old and vile horror
movie.
The even grimmer fact is that the war
cannot be ended in the predictable future
without greater disaster. Military escala-
tion, the march to the north that General
Nguyen Khanh calls for as an outlet to
his frustrations, may never come about,
but escalation of a political nature has
given what is happening here an import-
ance far beyond that of a dirty little
war in a remote and traditionally un-
stable part of Asia. US prestige is totally
committed. Washington cannot now
withdraw with any semblance of honor,
or any hope that if it does its Asian
alliances will stand the strain. But for
the ghastly failure of the Laotian experi-
ment, de Gaulle’s “neutralist” solution
might have been a face-saving way out:
but no one can pretend now that what
they have won in the field the Viet Cong,
and their backers, will concede at the
conference table in the common weal.
A heady scent for China
T>y sending General Maxwell Taylor,
with all his authority and prestige, as
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
to succeed Mr Henry Cabot Lodge as
ambassador, President Johnson shielded
himself to some extent from the domestic
bombardment that brinkman Goldwater
has already begun over the handling of
the Vietnam war. But the basic US
dilemma remains: it can afford neither to
lose the war nor to use its great sophisti-
cated strength in an all-out attempt to
win it.
Lor China the situation has a heady
scent. Here is that arch imperialist, the
United States, caught on a battlefield of
its own choice, going down with its
henchmen in defeat in a war of national
liberation. What a stimulus to the
national liberation movement in the' rest
of South-East Asia, in Latin America
and Africa! What a victory for Maoism
over Khrushchevism!
As for Khrushchev, much as he may
dislike the prospect of such a victory for
Mao, he cannot appear anything but
enthusiastic unless he too should be
classed as an anti-revolutionary and a
running dog of the imperialists.
"Correction. He's as game as the
archetypal image of Ned Kelly."


Around Melbourne
NO SUNDAY TUMBLING OR BURLETTA - YET
IJrian Fitzpatrick once wrote that
the Melbourne Sunday was a
work of art, like the Winged Victory
of Samothrace. This is absolutely
true. There is a tranquillity, a pure
beauty about this haven of domestic
calm that is unique. Indeed, it makes
one pause for wonder how the Mel-
burnian Sunday is managing to
survive, surrounded as it is by savage
commercial interests. Why, the vast
majority of Melburnians do not even
sully their Sunday mornings by going
to church. Citizens of cities which
sponsor rip-roaring, abandoned Sun-
days, like Paris and New York, are
much better churchgoers.
But, actually, our devotion to the
Sabbath was born through a Christian
background. Contrary to general
opinion, the vast mass of people who
came here during the gold rush were
not ruffians. They were God-fearing
artisans, including large numbers of
Presbyterians and an absolutely un-
common number of Methodists.
And so the pattern proceeded. The
major battle, the sort of Battle of
Stalingrad of Sabbatarianism, took
place from May to July, 1883. The
trustees of the National Gallery
decided to open the gallery on Sun-
day. Open warfare was immediate.
The leading clerics formed the Sun-
day Observance League and issued
a manifesto which contained the
words: “We assert the supreme
majesty of God’s Sabbath law against
its violators, nation or individual. We
will fight to the death for Sunday
for every toiler in the nation.”
Immediately there was a counter-
attack. The top rationalists formed
the Sunday Liberation Society and
they issued their manifesto. There
were a series of public indignation
meetings, for and against, in the
Prahran and Fitzroy Town Halls, and
I regret to say that at one of the
Fitzroy meetings Sabbatarians and
anti-Sabbatarians came to blows.
Even the Sabbatarians conceded
there was little harm “in innocent
recreation, such as a country ramble,
instructive reading and inspection of
works of art” on a Sunday. Perhaps
everything would have been all right
had not “Chloe” been on loan to the
gallery, and letters regarding this “un-
restrained and fully-developed figure
of a young female” ran for nearly a
month in “The Argus”.
Mr John Russell, for the Sabba-
tarians, demanded that the trustees
remove “an indecent picture of a
naked woman called by a classical
name". Eight art students wrote a
letter which said: “If there is any
indecency whatever, it exists only in
the remarks of your correspondent.”
Two of the signatories were Frederick
McCubbin and John Longstaff.
Naturally the matter came up for
discussion in the House and the
trustees were condemned by a large
majority, which made our dear
Sabbath secure almost for another
century and eventually reduced
“Chloe” from the dignity of a Sunday
gallery to tingle cheeks with shame in
a saloon bar in Swanston Street.
fThiERE have been sporadic battles
over the years. In 1921 the dread-
ful suggestion came up in Parliament
that sport should be allowed in
Prince’s and Yarra Parks on Sunday
afternoons. In the nineteen thirties,
too, the Sabbatarians were keeping
up a bold front. They were fighting
suggestions for Sunday band music
in the parks, and there were still no
trams on a Sunday before 2 p.m.
There w'ere a few trains on Sunday
morning known specifically as “church
trains”, and we rather hoped they
were used for no other purpose.
Now, in the ’sixties, our domestic
Sunday mornings are still untainted
by Sunday newspapers, and it is good
to be able to report that there is little
public outcry for it to be otherwise.
There is a great deal of activity in all
the parks, but commercial sport is
against the law. When we see signs
outside soccer matches, “admission
4/-”, we know that this is just a
voluntary donation to a charitable
footballing organisation.
According to the Theatres Act it
is possible to get a permit on a Sunday
for authorised stage entertainment,
public concert, reading, lecture, re-
citation or musical entertainment.
But the theatre owner has little
chance of getting a permit for any of
the following: ‘‘lnterlude, tragedy,
opera, comedy, stage play, farce, bur-
letta, melodrama, pantomime or any
stage dancing, tumbling or horseman-
ship.” As the “Herald” put it, you can
watch a concert or stage entertain-
ment on a Sunday, providing it
doesn’t make you laugh or cry and
doesn’t involve tumbling or horses.
Of course, you know what is
happening now. Last week The
Bulletin reported that our Chief
Secretary, Mr Rylah, had made the
statement that he was in favor of
opening picture theatres on Sundays.
Obviously, Mr Rylah was timidly
feeling his way into this incredibly
dangerous field. So far the result has
been remarkable. I have telephoned
both Fitzroy and Prahran Town Halls.
No indignation meetings have been
called and there hasn’t been a single
manifesto.
There has been, could we say, an
unholy quiet from the churches, with
just occasionally a chattering of gun-
fire. For example: (The Rev.) J.
Pearson Harrison (president), (The
Rev.) W. R. McEwen (hon. secretary),
of the Bible Union of Victoria, wrote
in the “Age”: “The Chief Secretary
seems to think that it is the function
of the Government to provide enter-
tainment for young people. Rather
it is the Government’s function to
uphold the law of God and to seek
to ensure one day of rest in seven.”
Naturally, the Government is being
very careful; we would never dare to
do anything on our own. The position,
we are told, will be examined in other
States and in New Zealand, and we
will seek evidence of what happens
in other parts of the world.
That is the sort of thing that could
take a great deal of time. And a
good thing, too; after a century or
so we are not anxious to destroy
something that is virtually alone in
the world. The only thing that really
scares us to death is the possibility
of yet another ROYAL COM-
MISSION.

End of the New Wave
Francoise Sagan’s Landru
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Bluebeard. Director, Claude Chabrol.
Palace Theatre, Sydney.
Tales of Terror. Director, Roger Cor-
man. Capitol Theatre, Sydney.
A Hard Day’s Night. Director, Rich-
ard Lester. Embassy Theatre,
Sydney.
/Claude Chabrol is a foundation mem-
ber of the exclusive “Cahiers du
Cinema” club of French film makers
one of the vocal, opinionated young men
who started as film journalists in that
idiosyncratic publication and later act-
ually put their theories into practice as
directors.
Most of the New Wave directors
came from the Cahiers du Cinema stable.
Chabrol was “one of the earliest” —“Le
Beau Serge” was released in 1958, “Les
Cousins” later the same year. Though his
output has not been prolific, he is highly
regarded for his influence on recent
French cinema.
The New Wave is now old hat, but
oddly enough Chabrol experiments much
more with cinema technique in his latest
film “Bluebeard”, Francoise Sagan’s
adaptation of the Landru story, the
early sequences of which have wit and
invention, though occasionally indulging
in cleverness for its own sake.
During the years of the first World
War, the mass murderer Landru enticed
lonely women (discovered through View
Mat. advertisements) to his country villa,
where, after a few days of passionate
devotion —he d : d give them that much
he killed them and disposed of them
in the fuel stove. Their small savings,
carefully administered, enabled him to
keep his family and a mistress.
Most of the early part of the film is
divertingly heartless, in the mood of
“Kind Hearts And Coronets” or “The
Trouble With Harry.” The sets and cos-
tumes comment wittily on the period, and
the camerawork is often enchanting with
its references to the French painters of
the first quarter of the century. Francoise
Sagan’s script was probably pretty good
too, but we’re only given a dubbed ver-
sion here.
But once the law begins to catch up
with Landru, the film nosedives. At first
Landru is presented as one of those
fictional rogy.es whose very outrageous-
ness wins one over —especially as the
police on his trail are as jerkily ineffi-
cient as the Keystone Cops. But once
Landru is caught, Chabrol, in an inter-
minable trial scene, reverts to a complete-
ly realistic style, in which he seems to be
trying to justify Landru’s crimes. Not
only is this morally impossible, it is
(even worse) exceedingly dull
I)oger Corman’s “Tales Of Terror”,
though hardly in the great horror-
film tradition, is an entertaining piece,
lent a certain stylishness by the compara-
tive reticence of the direction and by the
varied talents of that elegant actor
Vincent Price, starring in three Edgar
Allan Poe stories. “Morelia” has some
authentically chilling moments; “The
Black Cat" (which has got itself mixed
up with “The Cask of Amontillado”) is
played for laughs, with Price giving
a richly funny performance as a wine-
snob and Peter Lorre, forsaking his usual
eye-rollings, playing almost straight, and
giving an occasional hint of the great
actor he once was. “Monsieur Walde-
mar” is disappointing: an unnecessary
triangle drama has been written in, and
the end is a let-down instead of an
oozing liquid putrescence, all that re-
mains of M Waldemar looks more like
the solidified multi-colored grease to be
seen on Chianti-bottle candlesticks in
Italian-type restaurants.
To save others the trouble of saying
it, I'll admit that I’m about 50 years
too old really to appreciate the Beatles,
so their first film, “A Hard Day’s Night”,
left me unmoved.
It’s a loosely-constructed comedy
about the Beatles’ making of a television
show in an English provincial city.
They’re an amiable quartet, but not too
impressive as film stars the only one
to make a personal impact beyond being
one-quarter of the Beatles is Ringo Starr.
The sequence where he wanders through
the town, for once alone and unrecog-
nised, has charm and even a touch of
pathos.
OPERA
Misplaced
Trust?
Opera and Ballet. Elizabethan Theatre
Trust. Her Majesty’s Theatre.
Brisbane.
rpHE Elizabethan Theatre Trust is pre-
senting a joint season of opera and
ballet in Brisbane. Response has not
been up to expectation, particularly if
one remembers the deserved “House
Full” signs for last year's Mozart and
“Fidelio”. The reasons for the present
doldrum are not public ignorance of the
works presented: for many reasons the
Trust has developed an unpopular public
image. One reason that infuriates opera
lovers is that so much of its publicity
is inaccurate. In its official brochure
last year it described its best baritone
as a tenor, and this year it dishonestly
claims that Verdi’s “Macbeth” belongs
to his middle period, when in fact it
stems predominantly from the early
period, some four years before “Rigo-
letto”, itself early Verdi. In a country
where not even the “traditional” works
have been established in a regular re-
pertoire tradition, accurate information
is essential.
While they last, the present crop of
Orffs —“The Wise Woman” and “Catulli
Carmina” —afford a pleasant enough
evening but there is something sterile in
their substitution of repetition and geome-
try for lyricism. The best things in “The
Wise Woman” were the intelligible and
folksy singing of the three vagabonds,
Robert Gard, Ronald Maconaghie and
Alan Light, and the closing moments of
the spell sung by Cynthia Johnston as
she puts the drugged king to sleep. But
—and a big but for last year’s exquisite
Susanna this “wise woman” who
answers three riddles and carries the
burden of wisdom deputed to her by the
title —sang in almost unintelligible Eng-
lish. (A broadcast the following day
confirmed this.)
“Catulli Carmina” was far more suc-
cessful. Sung in Latin, its plot was
beautifully sub-titled by the dancers
Garth Welch and, on this occasion,
Heather Macrae; counterparts to the
singing lovers Peter Baillie and Althea
Bridges. On this occasion Baillie looked
and sounded better than he has ever
done in previous Trust productions. In
both works the Queensland Symphony
Orchestra sounded far better than it
has done in conjunction with Trust
operas before. Despite official vague-
ness on the matter, I suspect the use of
hidden microphones for the voices (a
highly unethical incursion from the musi-
cal comedy field, bad for singers’ repu-

Sometimes it is difficult to get the mess-
age. VENTILATION is one of the less
tangibles and not always too well under-
stood by those who may need it most.
It happens to be our business and maybe
we're more interested, but everybody
wants better air conditions. Usually the
great need is for a controlled forced
draught throughout the whole building
more here, less there not only for
removing stale air, smoke, cooking
odours and so on, but also for replacing
continuously with clean filtered air.
Cooling in summer in winter time the
air-flow rate is cut back to a gentle level
to retain the warmth provided by the
normal room heaters. Thoroughly engin-
eered mechanical ventilation can be a
low-cost answer to most air comfort

tations and not at all necessary in the
present theatre).
“Macbeth,” the early Verdi work,
proved less happy. One can hear in
this work time and time again pre-
echoes of Verdi’s ultimate greatness. Di
Luna, Fiesco, Azucena, Germont all rise
before the eyes, and the ensembles of
the first two acts are in the grand man-
ner that was to culminate in “Aida” and
“Otello”, but the present production made
the amateur mistake of confusing what
should be an aesthetic transformation of
gloom with merely visual dreariness.
There was a silly “dagger” apparition,
projected where Macbeth couldn’t even
see it, clumsy swordmanship, and a far
too modern buffet-style banquet scene
(couldn’t the King's palace budget run to
a table?). Costumes and crowns were
poor, and so was the monotonous, drab
monolith of a set like circus bleachers —
noisy to move on, and perilous to nego-
tiate in the continual half-darkness.
Unfortunately, Tais Taras simply didn’t
measure up to Lady Macbeth—the voice
at the top was not acceptable, despite
Verdi’s permission for the heroine to
“croak”, and the bottom was merely
sketched in. Miss Taras has given us
so many pleasant performances in the
past; this mis-casting is a pity, and her
English was unintelligible. When the
doctor in attendance in the sleep-walking
scene (which, in this perverse production,
she “sat out”) said something like “Do
you mark her words!” a voice near me
said, “Frankly, no!” Robert Allman
took the first act to get voice and cha-
racter in focus and continued to give an
acceptable, if never great, performance,
but his playing, too, was marred by
woolliness and emotionalism. It was left
to Neil Warren Smith, as Banquo—glori-
ous cf voice and noble of bearing to
vindicate Verdi’s first association with
Shakespeare.
Knowing Stefan Haag’s past Mozart
productions, the forthcoming “Cosi Fan
Tutte” may well save the operatic half of
the experimental partnership of the arts.
Of the two ballets new to Brisbane,
“Roundelay” may well be dismissed as
a pleasant curtain-raiser with its un-
integrated reminders of other ballets and
Marcel Marceau —hardly worth the ex-
pense of the Brack sets. In “The Dis-
play”, however, I believe that there is
a proper fusion of dance, setting and
music.
The rise of the curtain on the Sidney
Nolan decor was one of the most splen-
did moments I have known in theatre.
Here was a decor, based on Australia,
and yet as luxurious in its opalescent
coloring as the Diaghileffs seen in Lon-
don in 1955 f and the music of Malcolm
Williamson, alive with bird calls, was
exactly matched to the set’s physical
beauty. The figure of the lyre-bird was
poetry from the waist downwards. Per-
haps a brown, nude torso with a mini-
mum of fastening for the tail, and a
stylised head-gear would enable the ex-
tension of that poetry.
The dancing of Kathleen Gorham once
again convinced me that comparing her
with Fonteyn is beside the point. Gor-
ham’s heartbreaking quality is alien to
Dame Margot—it’s the old Kreisler-
Heifetz argument. It is with Yvette
Chauvire that our finest dancer should
be classed.

Produced by Stephen Fleischmann, and
obviously made this time last year, it
considerably pre-dates Harlem’s recent
riots. But at least it prophesied them.
In between shots of depressed, apathetic
and bored Negroes strolling the hot
summer streets and shots of mass Black
Muslim rallies and nervous, sauntering
white cops there were some first-rate
interviews. While the message of the
Black Muslims, violence and revenge,
was what one might have expected, that
of the NAACP and Urban League
leaders was not. Long accustomed to
regarding the NAACP and other
organisations as conservative, respon-
sible, even timorous, it was quite a
shock to hear the cool, intelligent
NAACP secretary openly criticise his
president, Dr Martin Luther King, for
espousing non-violence as being the
best method of protest. “It’s a tactical
weapon and nothing more,” he said. “If
non-violence doesn’t get us equality we'll
use violence.” It was tough talk, and
like the statements of others on the pro-
gramme it was a message of sheer des-
peration, a message which CBS got
across very successfully.

HThe great advantage of “Hollywood

popular framework, it can bring an
actor’s style and personality close to us
in a way few individual films can do.
Television’s special quality is that it
probes closely into a place, into significant
gestures and movements, with an intim-
acy greater than the cinema’s. And when


the personality is extraordinary—when,
above all, it has that extra vitality or
sparkle which goes with great talent and
its enterprises—the exploration has an
endless fascination.
“The Man Called Bogart” showed us
an entertainer of extraordinary magic,
tough, humorous and warm, with a
crumpled smile and a dry, lisping voice;
as Sam Spade in Dashiell Hammett’s
“The Maltese Falcon”, clashing with
Mary Astor’s treacherous B r i g i d
O’Shaughnessy, Sydney Greenstreet’s Fat
Man and Peter Lorre’s crimped and
perfumed Joel Cairo; shooting or punch-
ing it out in “The Roaring Twenties”
and “High Sierra”; memorably wrang-
ling with Katharine Hepburn in “The
African Queen”. Affectionately, yet
without schmaltz, the compilers also got
behind the scenes and showed him yacht-
ing, marrying Lauren Bacall and, fin-
ally, attending premieres gamely, know-
ing he was dying of cancer. “The Un-
sinkable Bette Davis” showed the star in
a glittering display of nerves, nastiness
and talent, bitchy in “Of Human Bond-
age” (an electrically intense sequence),
stricken with a brain tumor in “Dark
Victory”, shooting her lover on a
Malayan plantation in “The Letter”,
queening it as Elizabeth I in two pictures,
being cured of neurosis with two cigar-
ettes by Paul Henreid in “Now Voyager”
and playing herself twice in “A Stolen
Life”. The range, the astonishing way
in which she could transform her face
with make-up, the variations in the voice
from a high-pitched Cockney whine in
“Bondage” to a guttural imperiousness in
“Elizabeth and Essex”: here, certainly,
was the greatest of all the female stars,
condemned for most of her life to ani-
mate mindless novelettes with her fierce
intelligence.
“The Immortal Jolson” completely
failed to make clear to me the reason for
his popularity: the moaning figure on its
knees with hands outspread crying
“Mammy”, the ravaged face with eyes
like peppermint lumps; the obsession with
playing Negroes, all mysteriously ama-
teurish and awkward. And the star’s
mausoleum with a lifesize kneeling image
of him —a kind of Greek temple straight
out of Disneyland—seemed all too hor-
ribly appropriate. There was one in-
spired moment when the commentator
said that Jolson collapsed once he left
the stage into a stricken and lonely intro-
vert: a shot from one of his films showed
him clinging helplessly to a curtain as it
closed him off from a wildly applauding
audience.
In “Teenage Idols” there was some
unforgettable footage of mass hysteria
(especially in West Germany), teenage
girls wrecking stadia, performers without
voices speaking the lyrics of inane songs,
and sexual tension nakedly expressed in
row after row of transported faces. A
girl, her voice tight with nerves, asked
Fabian for a handkerchief or a coat; the
star was shown in a moment of loneliness
and shame, about to be fed to the mob,
and in desolate hotel rooms, caravans and
buses across America, wondering what
the heck he had got himself into.
The Wolper technique in these docu-
mentaries is to cut very rapidly from
scene to scene, never letting any single
image remain long on the screen; the
emphasis is heavily on hand-held camera,
so as to get as close as possible to the
star without the machine-tooled smooth-
ness of the usual Hollywood dolly-shot;
the commentary, admirably spoken by
Joseph Cotten, where possible cuts out
for the more telling images or sustained
takes. The episodes move so rapidly
that the ending of each one brings about
a sharp sense of disappointment: one
would like to have seen more.
The most notable achievement of the
whole series is to bring excerpts from
films to the public eye which have lain
forgotten in vaults for up to 30 years.
In “They Went Thataway” some stun-
ning footage of the land-rush from Wes-
ley Ruggles’ “Cimarron” and Howard
Hawk’s monumental “Red River”; in
the first half of “Sex Symbols” some
brilliant footage from Clara Bow movies,
especially a madcap party —all balloons,
Charlestoning chorines and showering
streamers —that caught to perfection the
popular image of the Twenties. And in
a long excerpt from “Gilda”—Rita Hay-
worth in black satin, peeling off elbow-
length gloves while singing “Put the
Blame on Marne” —we saw the quintess-
ence of a Hollywood, and of a star sys-
tem, that will never come back again.
a footnote to my remarks last week
on “The Outer Limits”, the most
extraordinary episode so far popped up
after the review had gone to Press: “The
Invisibles”, about some mysterious crea-
tures from space which grow into the
body of suitable hosts but form hide-
ously mis-shapen growths on those they
cannot possess; the Government appoints
an agent named Spain to investigate the
officials already under the power of the
Invisibles, which plan to take over the
country. The German Gerd Oswald’s
direction had extraordinary concentra-
tion and force, especially in the use of
close-ups and of the sound-track, with the
grunting and roaring of the parasitical
creatures in their rows of steel boxes, the
sinister tap-tap of a policeman's handball
against the wall of a hut, the sudden
whine of a car in a deserted driveway.
And George Macready’s head of the
Invisibles, caressing a revolting tortoise-
sized woodlouse parasite as he replaces
it in a box, ordering an ugly experiment,
had an eerie malign power with hints of
perversion reminiscent of his perform-
ance in “Gilda”, and no less impressive
on a smaller scale. Neil Hamilton as a
general in the grip of the Invisibles was
also remarkable; the shadowy Germanic
photography of Conrad Hall and Domi-
nic Frottiere's superb score were also
decided assets to a masterpiece of the
macabre.

Tn his book, “The Reluctant Art”, Benny
A Green illustrates jazz evolution by
likening the jazz musician to a juggler
who uses harmonies instead of oranges.
Thus, the New Orleans musician gives a
spectacular display by throwing and
catching a single orange. The number
of oranges in the air grows as more com-
plicated harmonic structures are used
and, each time another orange is added,
it becomes more difficult for the juggler
to perform with the poise and relaxation
essential to his act.
Louis Armstrong, who began by
handling that lone orange with unpre-
cedented skill, was one of the first to
increase the number (but never more
than he could handle gracefully) and,
it must be admitted, he has been juggl-
ing those same oranges for a good many
years.
This two-record set, “The Best of
Satchmo”, is nice to have even if the
title cannot be taken seriously and more
than half of the twenty-four selections
are already available in “Satchmo: A
Musical Autobiography”. The “autobio-
graphy” consisted of replayings by the
present All Stars of numbers originally
recorded by Louis between 1923 and
1934.
From Armstrong recreating his past
to Dave Brubeck striving to create his
future is quite a step. Brubeck has shown
himself at times to be a capable pianist
and has written a number of acceptable
tunes, but his work at the piano is more
often heavy-handed and insensitive, and
his general approach to jazz is preten-
tious. These tendencies frequently cancel
out the good work of Paul Desmond on
alto-sax and the Morello/Wright rhythm
team. “Time Changes” has less to offer
than usual. “Unisphere”, “Shim Wha”
and “Cable Car” have their moments, but
they are marred by the leader’s block-
chord hammerings.

portrait of a pioneer!
. . . the first of 5,000,000!
You are looking at the grizzled, steely
features of a true Australian pioneer—
a pioneer with a long record of service
to the community. It is the original
EMMCO electricity meter made by an
all-Australian venture—the Electricity
Meter Manufacturing Company—better
known today as Email. And here the
meter you see assumes significance of
a special kind.
For today, Emmco has grown and diver-
sified beyond recognition. It became
one of the founding companies of the
vast group of electrical and industrial
manufacturers called Email. The one
meter has become many: in fact, the
meters that measure the water that
comes in your tap, the phone calls you
make, the gas your stove uses—even
the minutes you park your car—are all
relatives of the pioneer meter that is
illustrated here.
They are typical of the way in which
Email and its other activities touch
your way of life every day—quietly,
unobtrusively but with a proud record
of service to Australia.

Man in an Urban Trap
The comic gifts of J. P. Donleavy
By R. G. GEERING
A Singular Man. J. P. Donleavy. The
Bodley Head. 265.
hero of J. P. Donleavy’s second
A novel appears, at first glance, quite
different from the aggressive, rumbus-
tious hero of his “The Ginger Man”,
Sebastian Dangerfield, who hit the Eng-
lish reading public between the eyes and
below the belt about the same time
as Osborne’s Jimmy Porter. To start
with, his name is much less offensive—•
George Smith —and though from his
position of wealth and privilege he some-
times abuses his underlings, he is basi-
cally timid and quiet. And yet, for all
their superficial differences, both these
heroes are unsure of themselves and the
world, and both are seeking escape from
a reality they cannot endure.
Sebastian wants a life of wealth and
pleasure, free from all responsibilities;
George, who has wealth, but still can’t
hold the happiness he glimpses on earth,
looks ultimately for a haven beyond.
Indeed, we can pinpoint a passage in
“The Ginger Man” from which this
second novel probably grew: in Chapter
20 Sebastian, reflecting, wishes to pre-
serve Miss Frost and the love they have
for each other in a house behind heavy
brass doors with good - quality brass
hinges, or in a huge garden with walls
forty feet high and three feet thick.
Like Sebastian (despite his bluster)
George Smith is a little man frightened
of all the prowling animals. The en-
trance to his flat is blocked by a
mechanically assisted door, made to his
specifications from thick surgical steel.
He shares this retreat from his wife
Shirl and their four children (whose in-
terest in him is now only financial) with
his Negro housekeeper (and occasional
mistress) Matilda, who is in the habit of
wrecking the serenity of the dwelling
with her wild religious gatherings.
George is certainly a singular man;
when his lungs gasp from the exertion of
walking along the street he “cleverly
switches to mental power to give the
muscles a rest”. He wears long red
underwear —and one is reminded of
D. H. Lawrence’s Mellors, who wants
to cure the evils of the modern world by
dressing all men in red pants to make
them aware of their masculinity—not
that George, who is generously endowed
physically, really needs any extra male
aids. He has a special adaptor device
fitted to his office phone which can be
made to play a bagpipes record to
scare away those enemies of his who
simply ring up and breathe down the
wires. This fearful man rides around in
a specially designed bullet-proof car
(with sirens) called “the dreadnaught”;
and to comfort himself on lonely Satur-
day afternoons he owns a machine with
a seeing eye, which roars and cheers
with 35,000 voices when he shakes his
fist or reaches the end of a sentence in
some imaginary speech. To keep per-
fectly fit he takes instruction and prac-
tice at The Games Club in boxing,
wrestling, fencing, and swimming. Most
significant of all, George Smith, a man
in his early thirties and with a perfectly
sound heart, is building, at enormous ex-
pense, the biggest mausoleum in Renown
Cemetery—imported marble, on a one-
acre plot. Browning, the architect, tells
him, “Been objections raised by several
neighboring plot owners (to the sur-
rounding wall) but as they are some way
off we feel they won't object to a height
of six three. And of course upon that
will be your boxwood hedge which ought
to give you another foot or two in five
years”.
Qmith invites his friends to the official
opening, and his beloved Sally Tom-
son (lost towards the end of the book,
first in marriage to another and then to
death in a road accident) to his funeral—
this, apparently, the highest compliment
he can dream of.
The narrative pursues a rather mean-
dering course through Smith’s attempts
to laugh off the threatening letters he
continually receives and to avoid news-
paper reporters, his brief escape to the
country, his return to the city and the
moving of his office to another area,
where he remains some time in a state
of siege. All the time his flight and
search for forgetfulness find their coun-
terparts in his various erotic adventures
—with Shirl (by chance and unconsum-
mated), with his secretaries Miss
and the beautiful, promiscuous blonde
Miss Tomson, and, towards the end of
the book, marking a regression, with a
much older woman who had first taken
him up when he was a college student,
and, after her, with Matilda again.
“A Singular Man” is a curious book
with an atmosphere all its own. For all
the broad, bawdy comedy of certain of
its scenes, it is essentially bizarre and
grim, and in its claustrophobic effects
rather like Kafka. Donleavy’s intention
is, presumably, to create a kind of
allegory of modern man trapped in his
earthly city, and to trace his retreat to
womb and tomb. Allegorising would
account for the vagueness that hangs
over Smith’s past life and, even over his
present job in the city, and for the
generalising of the location —the city is
pretty obviously New York but, more
importantly, it is an emblem of all
twentieth - century cities. Allegorising
could account, too, for the nightmarish,
even surrealistic presentation of some of
the events. But, having placed the book
in this way we then begin to have our
doubts. Even if the narrative move-
ment has general implications which are
clear enough, what are we to make of
certain of its details, for example the
letters Smith receives? We begin by
taking these to represent the threatening
aspects of the outer world, emblems
whose precise origin we do not need or
want to know. But towards the end of
the novel there is what appears to be a
rational explanation—the mysterious
signature J.J.J. might be attributed to
John Jiffy, who is madly in love with
Sally Tomson and jealous of Smith.
Then there is the character Bonniface,
a friend from the past, who had a hand
in bringing about George's marriage. It
looks as if Donleavy is jumping on the
psychological band waggon here; paral-
lels are drawn between Smith and Bonni-
face which point to that hardy perennial
the alter ego—but if this is so there still
remain several awkward things to ex-
plain in these sequences.
High claims were made for “The
Ginger Man”; it was compared, probably
because of certain similarities in charac-
ter and style, with “The Horse’s Mouth”
—inaptly, I believe, since Cary’s novel,
beneath its picaresque extravagance, is
a most carefully articulated statement
about the nature and demands of art,


whereas “The Ginger Man” is essentially
a good comic romp. The handling of
the interior monologue in this book will,
no doubt, provoke comparisons between
George Smith on the one hand and
Gulley Jimson and Leopold Bloom on
the other, but these would once again
be superficial only. Donleavy plays
games with the interior monologue as he
does on a simpler level with names; he
leaps around from first to third person
for the fun of it and he carries the frag-
mented stream of consciousness manner
over into his own narrative and descrip-
tion. Here manner becomes a manner-
ism which contributes an effect of mono-
tony to the style.
“A Singular Man” is a mixed dish;
its flavors don’t always blend, but the
comedy has a tang that will appeal
strongly to certain palates.
Racial Strains
Asian Migration to Australia: The
Background to Exclusion 1896-
1923. A. T. Yarwood. Melbourne
UP. 555.
TVrly in the 1900 s, white Christian
gentlemen discovered that servants
had feelings; in the 1940 s they dis-
covered that Asians, Africans and other
“colored” peoples had them too. At the
turn of the century, when the White
Australia policy was born, there was no
mealy-mouthedness among its supporters.
Prime Minister Barton told Parliament
that he did not think “the doctrine of
the equality of man was really ever
intended to include racial equality”.
Isaac Isaacs (then a Protectionist politi-
cian and already 120 per cent Austra-
lian) urged the nation to avoid “the con-
tamination and the degrading influence
of inferior races”. Another Protection-
ist, J. Wilkinson, emphasised the need to
“preserve Australia for all future time
to the best races of the world and not to
the servile races of Asia”.
Mr Yarwood’s careful, academic study
of the control of Asian migration to
Australia between 1896 and 1923 makes
it clear that the White Australia policy
was not actuated solely by economic
motives, though it also makes it clear
that there was no significant intolerance
of individual Asians as such during this
period and that there was strong opposi-
tion to any legal discrimination on
grounds of race directed at people
already resident in Australia. But when
the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901
was passed, the lack of any overt refer-
ence to race or color was not the result
of Australian sensibilities. The wording
of the Act was a compromise meant to
meet United Kingdom objections—the
objections that there should be no
formal, legal differentiation between citi-
zens of the Empire and no gratuitous
insults to Britain’s friend and ally,
Japan.
In one of the most interesting sections
of his book, Mr Yarwood brings out the
very direct effect which the status and
reputation of national governments had
on the treatment of their citizens under
the immigration policy. Japan, admired
and feared as a progressive, industrial
and military power, was able to make
effective representations on behalf of its
nationals: China, weak, rent by revolu-
tion and civil war, had no respect and
no power. The Chinese seeking the right
to enter or remain, forced to fend for
himself, had no opportunity to adopt the
law-abiding tactics of the Japanese. This,
together with the poor reputation of
China as a nation and the large number
of Chinese anxious to emigrate, com-
bined to make the Chinese the least
favorably treated “prohibited immi-
grants” of all.
These are only the broadest of the
many questions that Mr Yarwood, a
senior lecturer in history in the Univer-
sity of New South Wales, raises in his
work. He examines the difficulties and
jealousies that arose in dividing power
and responsibility between the Common-
wealth and the States, the practical
problems of administering a deliberately
wide Act with sufficient vagueness to
avoid offending powerful nations and of
determining “whiteness” in ambiguous
areas such as Syria. The book, it is true,
often reads all too much like the MA
thesis it originally was, but those patient
enough to go through it will find a
wealth of interesting material. Mr Yar-
wood, perhaps, sticks somewhat too
closely to his material and to his period;
but if he does not always sufficiently
illuminate he seems to take care not to
mislead.
ALICE ERH-SOON TAY
National Hero
Mawson of the Antarctic. Paquita
Mawson. Longmans. 31s.
T ady Mawson has established some-
thing of a biographical record in
writing the lives both of a distinguished
father, Dr Delprat, founding general
manager of the BHP, and of an equally
distinguished and even better - known
husband, Sir Douglas Mawson. To the
latter work, just issued with splendid
illustrations, the Duke of Edinburgh
writes an introduction.
Mawson was a scientist who won fame
as an adventurer and who, unlike so
many of his type, did not regard adven-
ture merely as one of the prices one
had to pay for knowledge. He came of
a Yorkshire family long established
around Stainburn and Fountains Abbey
in the lovely valley of the Wharfe. His
father, whose wool business failed,
brought him to Australia at the age of
two and settled at Rooty Hill for fruit
and wine growing, later becoming asso-
ciated with the great timber firm of
Saxton’s in Sydney. But this was only
after many vicissitudes and shifts in the
backblocks.
The family settled at “The Glebe” just
in time for Douglas to be sent to Fort
Street. When he left the school the
headmaster, then “Boss” Turner, is re-
corded as having described him as “an
acknowledged leader and organiser”,
adding that “if there be a corner of this
planet of ours still unexplored, Douglas
Mawson will be the organiser and leader
of an expedition to unveil its secrets”.
That was said in 1898 before Mawson
was 17 and he never forgot it. Much
of his organising ability came from his
shrewd Manx mother who trained him
in the minutiae of providoring, allowing
him to buy household needs in large
quantities as best he could and sell them
to her retail for family use. In contrast
to his brother, Dr Will Mawson, as
familiar as the church clock in Campbell-
town for many a year and well known
as a musician, Douglas’s service to
St Andrew’s Church choir consisted
mainly of some original essays in prac-
tical joking.
The whole tenor of the boy’s life was
influenced by destiny. His mother, who
eked out her husband’s means by taking
in boarders, had as a lodger the son of
the last whaling captain to operate round
the north of Australia. This introduced
her son to adventure and whales. Syd-
ney University, whither he went as an
engineering student, introduced him to
Professor David and geology. He secured
his Bachelor of Engineering degree in
the mining division, with second class
honors in chemistry and physics and
first class honors in geology, a prize for
petrology and honors in mining.
He experienced little of mining. A
period as demonstrator in chemistry at
the University, and another few months
at Adelaide University saw the end of
his sedentary academic work for a long
time. Six foot three of adventurousness
did not waste its youth on undergradu-
ates. Six months exploring the then wild
New Hebrides, during which he nearly
lost a leg, was followed by a practical
application of his knowledge as the one
and only authority on uranium occur-
rences in Australia. He identified the
first radium ore discovered in the Com-
monwealth and jointly pegged the first
uranium claim. And then he was with
Shackleton on his way to the ascent of
Mt Erebus and the discovery of the
South Magnetic Pole under the party
leadership of his mentor, Professor T.
Edgeworth David, to whom he was
second in command in the long, cold
trek that established Australians as
Antarctic explorers just as surely as


Hawker and the Smiths placed the Com-
mon weath in the forefront of global
flying a decade or so later.
In 1911, with honors showered on
him, including a D.Sc. from Sydney Uni-
versity, he organised his own Antarctic
Expedition in the Aurora , going to Eng-
land engaged to the authoress of his
biography before beginning an idyllic
married life of nearly 50 years. From
the moment of his engagement his cor-
respondence illuminated his life and
work in detail. He was that rare bird,
the man of action with the will to
chronicle his doings as he went along.
By the time he was 32 he was home
from his expedition in the little 386-ton
Aurora, a national hero, the youngest
Australian ever to be knighted up to
that time. The expedition had been
entirely his own creation —conceived by
his brain, financed through his charm
and persuasiveness and organised and
carried through by his quick-thinking
energy. It matured with the help of a
priceless crew of helpers which included
J. K. Davis, his second in command and
captain of the Aurora , Frank Hurley,
Mertz, and Frank Wild, an experienced
old Polar hand who made the decision
to winter on floating ice (Lady Mawson
erroneously describes him as a descen-
dant of Captain Cook who left no
descendants).
The expedition had surveyed 1000
miles of coastline between the Ross Sea
and Cape Adare, the position of which
had before been only vaguely known and
on which no man had ever before set
foot. They had shown the feasibility
of wintering usefully in the region and
had added generally to the knowledge of
various parts of the Antarctic and sub-
stantially confirmed the existence of the
Antarctic continent as a single land unit,
besides providing Mawson himself with
a huge mass of scientific material which
he was still sifting fifteen years later
while holding the position of first Pro-
fessor of Geology and Mineralogy at
Adelaide University. He had been ap-
pointed in 1921.
His second great expedition was the
British, Australian and New Zealand
Antarctic Research Expedition
(BANZARE), 1929-31, which the Com-
monwealth Government, as the result of
a decision at the Imperial Conference of
1926, asked him to undertake. It finally
proved the extent of the continent and
provided the material which led to the
passage of the Australian Antarctic Ter-
ritory Acceptance Act, under which the
Commonwealth assumed supervision
over the Australian Antarctic Territory
and created the Australian Antarctic
Planning Committee after World War 11.
Mawson was a member of that body from
which emerged the Antarctic Division,
External Affairs Department, which initi-
ated the continuous work of exploration
of our sector. One of the chief stations
bore Mawson’s name. He lived to see
the crowning efforts in Antarctic
exploration during the International
Geophysical Year.
He was one of the great men of Aus-
tralian history but, dying as recently as
1958, he is too close to us to be seen in
his true stature which assuredly will
become larger as the years go by and
the work in the Antarctic begun by him
reaches maturity.
Future historians and biographers will
have cause for congratulation in that he
married a wife who has been able
to set out the details of his life so clearly
against his domestic background, with
a due appreciation of what biographers
most need, with proper selectiveness and
clarity, and without the over-emphasised
sentimentality which is apt to flavor
matrimonial chronicles.

Comedians. Hugh Kenner, with
drawings by Guy Davenport. W. H.
Allen. 245.
HThe typographical revolution over the
centuries has changed the nature of
written language, says Mr Kenner. In-
stead of operating as a transcript of
actual speech, the printed word becomes
a new kind of experience which relies
on the characteristics of the book as a
physical object, existing in page-units
one can turn back to and forward from,
with footnotes that can be used in
counterpoint with the body of the text.
A purely typographic range of effects
becomes possible which in fact defeats
any merely phonetic rendering—the syn-
tax of “Time”-style or the megaphuns
of “Finnegans Wake”.
Furthermore, the advance of typo-
graphy leads to the alphabetically and
arbitrarily-arranged dictionary or ency-
clopaedia, in contrast to the subject-
focused compendium or summa of an
earlier day. “. . . Open the ‘Encyclo-
paedia Britannica’ itself, and the first
topic on which you will receive instruc-
tion is the letter A, and the second is the
meaning of the term ‘A-l at Lloyd's’,
and the fourteenth is the Aardvark.
“This,” says Mr Kenner, “is sublimely
nonsensical”: experience becomes a pile
of discrete “facts” capable of being rum-
maged and re-arranged like a school-
boy’s pocketful of treasures, isolated
and dwelt on or thrown together and
glanced at —life as kaleidoscopaedia.
The joint literary history of these two
processes Mr Kenner traces from Swift’s
“A Tale of a Tub”, which he calls “a
parody of the book as a book”, through
Pope’s use of solemn pseudo-scholarly
annotation in “The Dunciad”, and
Sterne’s baroque profusion of typogra-
phical tricks in “Tristram Shandy”, to
the three artists whom he sees as seizing
on these possibilities consciously and
organisedly. For him, Flaubert is the
“Comedian of the Enlightenment”,
Joyce the “Comedian of the Inventory”,
Bedkett the “Comedian of the Im-
passe”. They are Stoics, presumably
because they accept these developments
instead of resisting them, and comedians
because they explore their “comic” possi-
bilities, in the wider sense.
All this Mr Kenner expounds with
much wit and vivacity, throwing out a
continual fire of fascinating comment.
Anyone interested in the fate of language
under all the stresses that afflict it in
our day can hardly fail to be diverted
and stimulated by this book. It is much
more concerned to raise issues than to
suggest answers, but it does this brilli-
antly enough; to identify problems, or
provoke others to do their own identi-
fication, is at least as valuable as pro-
viding programmes.
And this is genuinely a work of liter-
ary criticism of a most necessary kind;
the one that points to some of the essen-
tial processes of the works it considers,
not merely their results. Indeed we are
here assisted to be stoic critics, seeing
what actually is happening (or part of
that) at a primary level, however we
apply this afterwards. In Mr Kenner’s
hands, as I hope I have suggested, this
result is achieved with much pleasure to
the reader. His quotations from Flau-
bert’s “Dictionary of Banality” are both
pertinent and hilarious:
SEA: Bottomless. Symbol of the infi-
nite —Gives rise to profound reflec-
tions. PROSE: Easier to write than
verse. EXTIRPATE: Used only of
heresies and corns. ERECTION:
Used only of monuments. FUNERAL:
Of the deceased. —And to think that I
had dinner with him only a week

Mr Kenner’s writing is zestfully lively
on the topic of footnotes, on which he
should be quoted:
“The book as book entails, then, Intro-
ductions, Prefaces, Apologies and Dedi-
cations; Headings, Subheadings; Tables,
Footnotes, Indices; even Pictures. The
way in which some of these help mecha-
nise the act of discourse is perfectly
plain. Take the footnote, for instance. 1
The footnote’s relation to the passage
from which it depends is established
wholly by visual and typographic means,
and will typically defeat all efforts of the
speaking voice to clarify it without visual
aid . . . You cannot read a passage prose
aloud, interpolating the footnotes, and
make the subordination of the footnotes
clear, 2 and keep the whole sounding
natural. The language has forsaken a
vocal milieu, and a context of oral com-
munication between persons, and com-


L en ced to take advantage of the expres-
sive possibilities of technological space.
| « ( t . The man who writes a marginal
/comment is conducting a dialogue with
(the text he is reading; but the man who
'composes a footnote, and sends it to
the printer along with his text, has dis-
covered among the devices of printed
I language something analogous with
counterpoint: a way of speaking in two
>voices at once, or of ballasting or modi-
fying or even bombarding with excep-
tions 3 his own discourse without inter-
rupting it.
1 I do not mean the scholar’s footnote which
supplies a reference, but the footnote that
supplements, qualifies, parallels, quips,
> digresses or elucidates.
And they are often less subordinated than
' counterpointed.
3 Some footnotes of course seem totally un-
related to the point in the text at which
they are appended. They suggest an art
form like the refrains in Yeats’ late poems.”
The suggestions about the nature of
■the basic procedures of the three nove-
lists are very valuable, and involve also
useful reflections about the novel form
itself, that at once obvious and murky
question. But at least as interesting are
Mr Kenner’s enquiries into what’s hap-
pening to language itself under the
enormous pressures of mass use in the
Secondary medium of print. Here he
imay be attackable on some points; I
•was taught myself that experimental
'psychology had established that even the
most sophisticated reader reacted to each
“syllable” he read with a minute but
? detectable chest-impulse (the first muscu-
lar stage towards producing a sound);
iin other words, that reading always
meant a response in terms of “speech”
i proper. But whoever is right on this
I we have been given here some excellent
provocative comments to chew over.
ALEXANDER PORTEOUS
American
Scandals
All Honorable Men. Walter Good-
man. Longmans. 31s. 6d.
;A* Walter Goodman reminds us, the
days are long gone past when Big
Jim Fisk, asked by a Congressional com-
mittee what became of the millions he
and Jay Gould made and lost during
their attempt to corner the United States
gold market in 1869, blandly told his
inquisitors: “It has gone where the wood-
bine twineth”.
Scandals still proliferate in the rich
soil of the United States, as Goodman’s
book makes abundantly clear, but they
no longer bloom so umbrageously and
defiantly. Corruption, when exposed,
hangs her head and pleads that nobody
w as really hurt. Charles van Doren,
who walked off with 129,000 dollars from
phoney TV quiz shows, burst into tears
when his complicity was revealed. Gene-
ral Electric executives jailed for price-
rigging plaintively asserted that they only
wanted to help maintain the stability of
the national economy. How Jay Gould
would have scorned such weeping and
paltering!
Goodman has chosen three main
themes, all of post-World War II date,
to illustrate his picture of the seamy side
of American Big Business. The first
section, a lively survey of corporation
ethics, concerns the arraignment of 29
electrical power and equipment com-
panies—including two of the giants in
the land, General Electric and Westing-
house—on charges of price-fixing and
bid-rigging. By the time the battery of
80 corporation lawyers had fired their
last shot, the companies and 44 of their
senior executives had been fined nearly
two million dollars and ordered to pay
millions more in compensation to their
customers.
If the ordinary public found it hard to
keep track of the devious finagling of the
electrical corporation scandal, there was
an appealing homeliness about the rela-
tionship between Presidential Assistant
Sherman Adams and his generous busi-
nessman friend, Mr Bernard Goldfine.
Goodman remarks that this oddly-
assorted pair, Adams, the upright New
Englander, and Goldfine, the millionaire
Jew out of an East European ghetto via
a Boston slum, “seemed to be performing
a parody of ‘Abie’s Irish Rose’ written
by a member of the Socialist Workers
Party”. A 2500-dollar Oriental rug, a
vicuna coat, luxury hotel suites in New
York and Boston—these were among the
gifts that the unwary Sherman Adams
accepted from his persistent admirer and
that led to his downfall. Not that Mr
Goldfine expected anything in return.
“I did not want an eye for a tooth,” he
once declared, in a phrase that Sam
Goldwyn might have envied.
Goodman’s third section deals with
rackets in the American entertainment
world, and particularly with the explo-
sive revelation a few years ago that al-
most all the big television quiz shows
were rigged to greater or lesser degree.
It is the most fascinating part of his
thesis, but it also most clearly demon-
strates the frustrating weakness of this
book. “All Honorable Men” is wisely
and often wittily written. But it rambles
about too much and the Australian
reader, unenlightened in all the nuances
of the American political and business
scene, may find it hard to form a clear
picture of the essential facts in each
case.

The Isle of Lies. M. P. Shiel. Victor

ITichard Middleton’s “The Ghost
Ship” is genuinely imaginative writ-
ing. Though there is humor here—the
title story is a gaily irreverent spoof of
the conventional ghost story —the pre-
vailing mood is sombre. In particular the
stories of the unhappy schooldays of a
misfit child have a deep melancholy, and
are a moving and perceptive picture of a
boy whose many gifts do not include the
essential one of adaptability.
“The Haunted Woman” is gracefully
written, and there are moments of
sharp observation of personal relation-
ships, revealed in conversations whose
bitchiness just shows through their
social aplomb. David Lindsay has a
flair for the comedy of manners, and
evokes with some skill an elegant,
leisured atmosphere; it’s a pity he is
distracted by his flirtation with the
supernatural.
Isbel Loment is vaguely dissatisfied
with her eligible fiance, whom she feels
unlikely to inspire the rare passion of
which she feels herself capable. On a
visit to an old house, she sees and
ascends a non-existent staircase leading
to a long-destroyed tower. Here she
meets the man who is to arouse her
passionate love.
The heroine of “The Isle of Lies”
inspires flowery protestations. “With
the feast of your kiss still in my
mouth,” her suitor tells her, “I thought
in my dream that your feet walked with
mine athwart fields of asphodel in
future far, far off under a morphia
moon.”
The young man always talks this way,
which makes him a terrible bore as well
as being totally unbelievable. He’s the
son of a scientist who begot him chiefly
to test his theory that supermen could
be created by proper education. When
grown, the youth runs away, to reappear
in France as a multi-millionaire, a poli-
tical power and the proprietor of an
Oriental-style palace situated in Brittany.
He ends up penniless, disgraced and
blinded by vitriol, which surprisingly
brings about his conversion and a happy
ending. These three books are the latest
in Gollancz’s “imaginative fiction”
reprints.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Three Times Winner
Amid the war fears of last week, US companies continued
to announce record profits for 1963-64, aided by lower
taxes, increased productivity (up 4 p.c.) and lower unit
costs. Manufacturers are gleefully reporting that this is the
first time since World War II that profits have risen three
years in succession.
To some extent the pattern can be paralleled in Australia,
where motor firms are enjoying record business, retail sales
are strong and increased profits are encouraging fresh capital
investment. But another identical pattern emerges. Skilled
labor is becoming scarce and the wage earners are demanding
a greater slice of the cake.
The Detroit automobile workers are negotiating for wage
increases. This is expected to touch off a round of wage
demands in the US. Australia has just had a £1 a week
increase in the Federal basic wage, while the shortage of
skilled workers is going to place heavier demands on the wage
structure.
The year 1964 has been predicted as a good year all round,
mainly because wage costs have been held down. But con-
tinuation of the boom indeed must create greater pressure
and so make it increasingly difficult to maintain profit margins
without price increases.
Steel companies already are reporting lower earnings in the
US as an aftermath from the hoarding boom in 1963, when
strike threats ran hot. The US Administration previously
has refused to countenance higher steel prices and if steel
and motor profits show a definite downward movement later
this year, it could be the signal for the end of the boom,
barring another Korea in Vietnam.
It all suggests for Australia that a great deal of reliance
is placed on a continuation of the boom in the US, whether
we admit it or not; because a downturn in the US would
spell finis to the remarkably high world commodity prices
now available, some of which have been stimulated by stock-
piling in anticipation of an extension of war in Vietnam.
Indonesia Gets Dutch
Export Credits
Dutch Government has at last come good with some
£AI3 million of export credit for Indonesia. This very
practical sign of financial reconciliation should have provoked
little surprise, or shock.
In fact, only a few weeks ago, amounts of the order of
£3O million were being freely mentioned as the possible size
of officially guaranteed credit.
Presumably Netherlands’ Foreign Minister Dr Funs, whose
economic and political mission has just left Djakarta, needs
to be fully convinced about Indonesia’s professed intentions
to compensate nationalised Dutch businesses before supporting
wider credit facilities.
Dr Soekarno’s immediate economic programme will there-
fore be watched with great interest, and a measure of
apprehension, by the trade-conscious Dutch. Recent un-
certainties, however, have not diminished the plans of a
number of private industrialists to set up again in Indonesia
or to discuss joint ventures with domestic manufacturers.
Prime among them, of course, is the huge Philips Electrical
combine, which has overcome its scruples on Government
confiscation and is now engaged in aiding an Indonesian
company to make lamps, television and radio sets and tele-
communications equipment.
Without going into the obvious political causes, Indonesia’s
chief economic worry, however, has been its increasingly poor
international credit-worthiness. Exports, for instance, dropped
heavily during the first four months of 1964.
Ordinary prudence, and a willingness to meet the demands
on nationalisation, could almost certainly lead to continuous
Dutch credit.
Whether Dr Soekarno has made a proper initial reaction
may look a trifle doubtful. He began by centralising all
economic policy under himself and threatening “direct steps
against those who damage the economy and commit economic
treason”.
Psychiatrist’s Couch Attracts
Insurance Companies
Insurance houses are taking a critical look at their fire,
accident and general insurance business as company after
company reports higher claims and rising costs. The remedy
is not simply a matter of raising premiums to counter the
trend. This solution is not so easy in the face of growing
competition, particularly with life offices entering the general
insurance field in greater numbers.
There is a great deal of soul-searching going on in the big
insurance groups all over the world and the traditional methods
of assessing risks are under fire. Outside criticisms (and
sometimes self-criticisms) suggest that insurance business has
not kept pace with the times. There have been shareholder
complaints that insurance boards are over-crowded with over-
paid amateurs, while there are insufficient competent managers
and inspectors.
Fire losses and motor vehicle claims are engaging the most
attention. It is suggested that the situation would be even
more serious if it were not for the buoyant income currently
derived from the successful investment division of most
insurance groups.
There is agitation for a reassessment of risks, re-writing
policies, introduction of computers to cut down on salaries
(which are claimed to average 65 p.c. of costs) and, generally,
to reform a system which was suitable for the horse-and-buggy
and the small factory but has been outgrown in this modern
industrial age.
As an example, a British survey recently came up with
the argument that large, modern, open-plan factories with
single roof-span and extensive storage facilities tend to increase
the risk of total fire loss. Fire in an annexe or a separate


storeroom of an older type factory could limit the fire loss
to a small area.
Similarly, with the huge rise in car numbers on the roads,
plus an increase in horse power, the variety and possibilities
of accident are very much broadened.
Southern Pacific Insurance Co. Ltd (a NSW registered com-
pany controlled by W. R. Carpenter Ltd, operating in NSW,
Victoria, Fiji and New Guinea) has just reported a fall of
41 p.c. in underwriting surplus. Directors blamed workers’
compensation and motor vehicle losses for the worst result
in years, despite an improvement in premium income. New
Zealand Insurance Co. Ltd, despite a near-record profit after
absorbing the business of the unfortunate Standard Insurance
Co., reported an increased ratio of losses to premiums.
Others in the insurance business will be watched closely
as results come to hand for 1963-64.
There is still plenty of fat to fall back on and the current
self examination should be all to the good. More than pass-
ing interest, therefore, is being taken in the new Sydney
flotation, Sydney Mutual Insurance Ltd, which last week
announced the placement of 150,000 10s. shares at 20s. This
group originated in 1916 as the Timber Trade Mutual Acci-
dent Insurance Association Ltd, and also operates in the hire-
purchase field through Wentworth Acceptance Pty Ltd.
Prospectus shows consolidated net earning rate of 29.61,
26.29 and 20.74 p.c. on proposed capital of £325,000, but
warns that the latest figure is for six months only to December,
1963, and that premium income for the first six months of
the financial year usually is substantially higher than the
second half year.
This does not dampen investors’ enthusiasm, because the
shares are being rushed, with allocations of only 100 shares
to most clients of the Sydney underwriting broker.
Deposit Gap a Crucial Factor
in Housing Finance
TPhe so-called deposit gap continues to be the major hindrance
facing potential home buyers. That not very novel con-
clusion last week received some exact statistical backing as
the result of a survey published by the Victorian-based Housing
Industry Research Committee.
The evidence assembled should certainly interest the Federal
Department of Housing, especi-
ally as it embarks on an attempt
to found a national housing
loans insurance corporation, as
promised at the 1963 election.
For one of HIRC’s emphatic
recommendations is that no up-
ward adjustment be made in
maximum loans until lending
conditions in the institutions
(and other home financiers) are
changed. The committee also
urges that all institutions be
made to seek registration as ap-
proved lenders so that they may
make 95 p.c. loans backed by
the Government guarantee.
What has impressed HIRC
most of all is the large propor-
tion of home purchasers who re-
quire secondary finance. From
a sample of 476 lower-priced
homes sold by builders or fin-
anced by co-operative societies
in Victoria during the last six
months of 1963, 55 p.c. of buy-
ers needed bridging finance to
help with their deposits.
Combined House and Land Prices
The importance of the “deposit gap” in housing finance has
been brought out once more in a recent survey by the
Housing Industry Research Committee of Victoria, and is
referred to in an article on this page. The graph
above shows the distribution of combined house and land
prices among the sample examined by HIRC.
The average amount of such finance reached £670, withf
interest rates ranging from 6 p.c. (reducible) to 10 p.c. flat 1
In every case the borrowers could not satisfy institutional!
lending rules, particularly in respect of a minimum qualifying 1
equity.
Some 82 p.c. of the sample represented a marked concentre 1
tion around an average house-and-land price of £4837. The
combined price is made up of 24 p.c. for land and 76 p, c ,
for the house.
Loans are, of course, made on the combined price. It
became clear, though, that secondary finance was not used
to buy a more expensive home but simply to supplement an
available deposit.
Most significantly, the patterns of financing demanded
rested solely on the deposit differences. The average income
of the two groups (those with sufficient deposit and those
without) turned out to be the same. The capacity to accumulate
deposits was influenced by different spending and saving habits,
More Market Glamor for
Tin Flotations
spot tin prices up around £stgl26o a tort in London
and Australia still importing some of her requirements,
tin shares have been popular in the local market.
Now another newcomer has entered the arena, Greenbushes
Tin NL, of Western Australia, which is raising £715,000 to
bring its tin and tantalite mine into operation. The Aberfoyle
Holdings group, which has a stake in Ardlethan, also spon-
sored the Greenbushes project.
There are hopes that tin prices, because of the current
shortage of metal and the political problems facing areas like
Malaysia, will remain buoyant. If so, the newcomers should
make a go of it. But any sharp setback to prices must cause
a re-casting of production economics.
Gif! Minks for Every
Housewife ?
Perhaps the day may not be too far off when housewives
get a mink coat with their new washing machine instead
of a box of soap powder.
Unilever, which operates
Bird’s Eye as a subsidiary in the
UK, has decided to use fish
scraps from its freezing opera-
tions to supply food for a new
mink farm it has established.
Bird’s Eye has formed a subsidi-
ary company, called Solitaire
Furs, in East Suffolk, England,
and aims to produce 37,000
mink pelts a year by 1967.
The new proposal has put the
other 300 British mink farms
into a bit of a flap, because the
planned output of mink from
the Bird’s Eye farm is more than
15 p.c. of the current UK pro-
duction of 200,000 pelts. Good
quality pelts can fetch anything
between £6 and £l5. The British
output is only small in relation
to the world market of around
16 million pelts annually, with
the Soviet, US and Canada the
major producers.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Fitting in More for Defence
Some spending will be shunted to overseas account
A fascinating economic exercise is in
the making now the Government
has laid it on the line that, on top of the
big increase in defence spending in the
Budget, there may well be further sub-
stantial additions in the course of the
year as a result of an expected review
of the requirements of the Services.
The Treasurer has succeeded in
arranging his Budget figure for defence
without much detriment to the numerous
other demands on the Federal Govern-
ment’s purse. This seems to have been
partly justified by the consideration that
a good deal of the additional claims of
defence in the first instance this year
'will be met from overseas resources,
both income and reserves. Further, it
may have been argued that the £5O
million or so increase on last year’s
direct defence budget is a marginal
figure in a cash Budget covering expen-
diture of the order of £2500 million.
*For the time being, at any rate, the
Treasurer could conveniently neglect the
thought that if a further £5O million is
added for defence in the course of the
year the total (from £350-£375 million)
might well become rather more than
just marginally significant in the nation-
al economic equation, even if not be-
yond the Treasurer’s competence to
■ finance.
Starting the year with £854 million in
overseas reserves and a small (£5.3 mil-
lion) but still favorable balance on over-
seas visible trade in the month of June,
the Treasurer probably took the view
i that, despite the rising trend in private
/ imports, we could afford a good many
months of small trade deficits before
our overseas expenditure on defence
would begin to make uncomfortable in-
roads into our international reserves.
One doesn't know precisely, or even
i vaguely, how much the Government in-
i’’ tends to spend overseas on defence this
year, but the proposed build-up of heavy
armament suggests that a higher pro-
portion of the Budget total will be spent
overseas than last year.
' Ponsidering the acknowledged demand
pressures in the internal economy, it
will be convenient if this is the way in-
creased defence spending works out. Of
course, nobody should run away with the
idea that a substantial increase in local ex-
penditure on defence will not take place
this year. Moreover, despite the attempt
to damp down demand in other direc-
tions as an offset to this higher local ex-
penditure on defence, the latter seems
bound to add to the general internal
demand pressures. There would certainly
seem to be good arguments for diverting
as much of it as possible to overseas
account.
Optimism about the availability of
overseas funds certainly seems justified,
despite the virtual ban on borrowing
from the US. It is by no means certain
that we are now to run into a series of
visible trade deficits. But on the recent
trend in imports and the narrow visible
trade surplus in June, this would seem
to be definitely on the cards unless ex-
ports can do even better than last year.
In the recent June quarter, imports
averaged £lOBl million a month com-
pared with £92.9 million a month in the
same quarter 1962-63, an increase of
£15.6 million a month. In June itself
this year they amounted to £110.7 mil-
lion, which was as much as £20.9 million
higher than the previous June.
These increases in imports are formid-
able and doubtless more are in store.
On the other hand, up to June at least,
exports have been outmatching them. In
the June quarter 1963-64 exports aver-
aged £22.1 million a month higher than
in the previous June quarter, whereas
imports averaged only £15.6 million a
month higher. Between the two months
of June the gap was much smaller
exports were up £22.8 million and im-
ports £20.9 million. The question is
whether exports can continue to stay on
top.
If imports averaged £llO million (the
June figure) a month this year (this
might turn out to be a conservative esti-
mate), exports would have to improve
substantially on last year (which was by
far the best export year ever, with a
total of £1383.9 million or £ll5 million
average a month) for us to achieve a
visible trading result anything like as
satisfactory as last year’s £197.5 million
surplus on recorded visible trade. This
figure should not be confused with that
of £250 million for the visible trade
surplus shown in the preliminary esti-
mates for the 1963-64 balance of pay-
ments last week: the latter reflects the
former after adjustment for balance of
payments purposes.
Of course, the extent to which we
will possibly have to dip into inter-
national reserves this year to finance,
inter alia, higher private imports and
overseas defence spending will depend
on several other factors in the balance
of payments besides exports.
Nor will the result of visible trade
itself necessarily be decisive for reserves.
Although visible trade transactions are
in fact many times in value those of
other classes of transactions in the bal-
ance of payments, and for that reason
are potentially liable to swing the balance
more decisively than others, movements
in our overseas reserves in any one year
are not an independent function of the
visible trade surplus. For instance, when
visible imports and exports are equal,
the net results of other classes of trans-
actions will determine the effects of the
balance of payments on reserves. Again,
even when there is a huge visible pay-
ments surplus, the net change in reserves
can still be smaller or greater than it.
rpms is what happened last year, when
-*■ heavy net invisible payments converted
the £250 million (balance-of-payments
figure) surplus on visible trade to a
current account deficit of £l4 million.
After taking into account net capital
movements and other balancing items,
this deficit was converted into a gain of
£228 million in international reserves
from balance-of-payments transactions.
Looking ahead to the prospects for
the reserves, while one can only guess
at how exports will fare this year
it seems inevitable that imports and also
net invisible payments will rise substan-
tially this year. So we could be in for
a much bigger deficit on current account.
Net capital movements look like having
the last word in determining the net
availability of overseas funds from the
year’s balance of payments.
Thus far, there is no sign of capital
inflow weakening from last year. From
the preliminary figures for 1963-64, it
appears that at £257 million the net gain
from capital movements and the balanc-
ing item in the overseas payments
account was little changed from the pre-
vious year’s gain of £253 million.
So, summing up, although imports are
on a higher and rising platform, at least
one would not at this stage predict we
will necessarily run into a sizeable
visible trade deficit this year. But if ex-
ports fall short of last year, say drop to
£l3OO million and capital inflow langui-
shes, it could well mean we would lose
from £l50 —£200 million of internation-
al reserves this year. Such a solid drop
would also depend on how deep the
Treasurer finds he has to dig into them
to finance his defence spending as the
year proceeds. The possibility of such
a drop should certainly not deter him
from shunting as high a proportion of
defence spending as possible on to over-
seas account.


“CROESUS”
Pioneers in Australian Business
A review of C. D. Kemp’s “Big Businessmen "
Tn my experience most “big” Aus-
A tralian businessmen are earthy, shy,
sensitive people who prefer to keep their
“image” as private as possible. They
will tell you a lot less than you want to
know about themselves and their
businesses, and then usually only the
things they want you to hear. Some, but
not all, have a soft underbelly, pride
which can be tickled to advantage, but
their watchword is “reticence” which is
not easily broken. So, as subjects for
biography, for most of them you had
better wait until they are dead.
This is what C. D. Kemp has done
with Herbert Gepp, Walter Massy-
Greene, Leslie McConnan and Geoffrey
Grimwade—four outstanding Australians
who helped Kemp to get the Institute
of Public Affairs off the ground and in
their various spheres also made contri-
butions to the national scene which up
to this time have not been documented
as fully as they are here. Apart from
Grimwade, they all got the accolade of
knighthood for their services.
None of these men come out of this
book (published by the Institute of
Public Affairs) as the ideal businessman,
though all are, in a sense, typical of the
Australian product, at least of their time.
One doubts, though, whether the rough-
hewn Gepp ever really thought of him-
self as a businessman and, from Kemp’s
description, when he actually assumed
the mantle of managing director and
chairman of Australian Paper Manu-
facturers, he was probably thinking he
would prefer to be conquering other
worlds in which his visionary hormones
would have had freer play.
Though Kemp would obviously have
liked Gepp, on whose staff he served
at Australian Paper Manufacturers, to
have come up as a more satisfying
character than he does in this portrait,
the fact remains that his faithful picture
is of a man whose talents were somehow
misdirected. Gepp suffered like so many
people who have essayed prominence on
the national scene only to find they were
victims either of the times or of the
national failure to tolerate visionaries
even when, in Gepp’s case, his record as
Government advisor, international
liaison officer and economist were un-
impeachable. Perhaps Gepp’s fault was
not his own, but only that he was before
his time. We could certainly do with a
few more of his calibre now in pushing
on with national development.
For all that, opportunists, and Gepp
was certainly one, have to take their
chances. When opportunities run out
they have to settle for something less
than they feel to be their true destiny.
So, after a career which embraced some
of the most tremendous developments in
Australian industry —for instance, the
growth of Broken Hill and its outwork-
ings throughout our basic industrial
structure and the beginnings of
national development in the purposeful
sense we know it today, Gepp had to
be content with a pis alter, out of the
limelight he liked so much and probably
deserved, but still a respected figure,
almost in the same mould as W. S.
Robinson, with the difference that Gepp
sought the limelight but W.S. eschewed
it. There could be no higher plane for
an Australian industrialist’s epitaph.
TVTassy-Greene also comes over in
this book as an opportunist astride a
land of opportunity. Like Gepp he came
to the role of businessman. Even when,
at fifty, he ran out of other things to
do and took a comfortable chair in
Collins House, from where he held sway
over a multitude of companies, he was
more the professional director than the
businessman, the retired Senator who
had yet to reveal his best mettle (he got
within an ace of being PM at one time
and no one doubts he would have made
a good fist at the job). One imagines he
was a more attractive character when
he was riding majestically over the Aus-
tralian political scene than in his final
years, when I used often to visit him
and listen patiently to his pleas against
the revaluation of the pound and for
the re-enthronement of gold.
Like Gepp also, he was a sort of jack-
of-all-trades, as one probably had to be
in the formative stages of industrial
development here. It was a case of not
letting the grass grow under your feet.
But when these two came later to the
business scene and the board room, they
obviously felt no less uninhibited than
in their early adventurous days. Kemp’s
account of Sir Herbert’s form as
managing director of Australian Paper
Manufacturers during a certain Easter
when its mill at Botany started opera-
tions is no less startling than that of Sir
Walter’s antics towards his staff at
Associated Pulp and Paper on VJ Day.
Even if unruliness kept bobbing up,
these two angry young men were eventul
ally sobered up by business response
bilities in their later years. But with Sii
Leslie McConnan, the complete banker
it was quite a different story and one
which Kemp gets across much better'
than those of obstinate characters like
Gepp and Massy-Greene. From hist
writing it seems possibly Kemp was a
bit too close to Gepp and Massy-
Greene, was too much endeared of
them. He was certainly not close nor
very endeared to McConnan, even if
there was mutual respect, but his observa- 1
tions on McConnan seem more acute,
In any case, McConnan was a man of
few words, as I remember quite well
from a lunch I had with him and the
late Sir Keith Murdoch in the early
19505.
Kemp portrays McConnan as a rather
subtle character. To my mind this is
not correct. I believe he was more of
the single-minded banker dedicated to
that noble art, but without a great deal
of imagination and rather ill at ease be-
yond the immediate confines of the bank
chamber. True, he emerged as the
bankers’ leader against the nationalisation
of the trading banks and pursued his
conflict with Chifley right through from
the Royal Commission on Banking (1935)
to the ultimate defeat of the nationalisa-
tion design in 1949. Yet there was some-
thing lacking in his make-up which
makes him fall something short of a
banking Saint George. Perhaps it was
the sword.
/"|ne cannot put either McConnan oi
Grimwade in the same category of
Australian business and industrial
pioneers as the first two subjects of this
book—certainly not Grimwade, whose
eminence in the business world as chair-
man of Drug Houses of Australia and
member of the Commonwealth Bank
Board was something less than any of the
others. Moreover, Grimwade started
some distance up the ladder, whereas the
rest climbed up from the very bottom,
none more so than McConnan who as a
youth joined the National Bank of Aus-
tralasia in the bush and retired after
many years as its general manager. Yet
for all Grimwade’s silver spoons, he has
impressed Kemp as much as any of the
others for his business capacity and pub-
lic spirit alike. His untimely passing in
1961 at the age of 58 is, therefore,
more the pity.


A Great Yen for Scrap Metal
Producers want protection through export ban
Australian non-ferrous scrap metal
producers are worried about a
shortage of scrap, particularly copper.
Their protests to the Federal Govern-
ment on the export of virgin and scrap
copper have not borne fruit. Some of
them feel that unless restrictions are
placed on these exports the scrap metal
industry could be in grave danger of
failing.
So worried are they about this position
that they are believed to be planning a
national campaign to get some form of
restriction placed on these exports. At a
conference in Canberra recently, the in-
dustry met with refusal by the Govern-
ment to agree to any form of limitation.
The Non-Ferrous Metal Manufacturers’
Association says the Government created
the present situation by gearing
the Australian price of virgin
copper to the world producers’
price at a time when prices on
the London Metal Exchange
were considerably in excess of
the price charged by world pro-
ducers. No simultaneous action
was taken to ensure that scrap
copper prices were properly re-
lated to the Australian price of
virgin copper.
The non-ferrous scrap metal
industry is founded on copper
and copper alloys, so its concern
at diminishing supplies is under-
standable. One manufacturer
pointed out that although the
problem is not critical at present,
the increasing population and
heavier demands made on min-
erals by secondary industry in
the future could have serious economic
consequences. “If we are going to be a
country supporting 30 million people by
the year 2000, as one economist has fore-
cast, I feel that no minerals should be
exported unless they are in the form of a
finished product,” he said.
“As we are expanding rapidly in indus-
A try and we cannot always rely on
wool for our income, it is only natural
that the number of people engaged in
secondary industry will expand at a
greater rate than the population. And
what are we going to give them to work
with—our own supplies or are we going
to import them?” the manufacturer
added.
Australian industry uses abut 19,000
tons of copper scrap and about 21,000
tons of copper-alloy scrap each year.
Increasing exports have forced the
price of scrap copper up in Australia.
Members of the non-ferrous association
raised the price of metals by as much
as £5O a ton recently, putting the price
of scrap above the price set by the world
markets in an effort to keep the metals
in Australia.
Increases of up to 5 p.c. in the cost
of builders’ hardware, which includes
copper and copper alloys, have been
foreshadowed, as a result of the higher
price for non-ferrous metals in Australia.
This position has occurred, say manu-
facturers, since the withdrawal of export
restrictions in June, 1958. Then the
p r j C e of copper-alloy scrap was related
directly to the price of virgin copper.
Since then, the price of copper scrap
has been affected by the export price
offered.
Japan is still our largest customer for
scrap metals and has, at times, tendered
prices well in excess of normal in order
to obtain supplies.
T , ... . r_ _ r'a
The association at the conterence
sought either export duties, quantitative
restrictions, licences or a complete ban
on the export of copper scrap only, to
prevent the present situation deteriorat-
ing further.
spokesman for the industry said a
shortage of virgin copper was causing
greater demands on the supply of scrap
copper and that the position would not
be rectified until early next year. Export
of copper scrap for the financial year
just ended would increase by more than
400 p.c. on the average of the previous
five years. An ironical feature of Aus-
tralia’s present copper situation was the
import of more than 1000 tons of copper
alloy ingots from New Zealand during
the P ast 12 months,
The ingots were made from copper
scrap, as New Zealand bans the export
of copper scrap as such. Australia had
to import the ingots (which cost far more
per ton than the scrap) to counter the
effects of its own permitted scrap ex-
ports,
T° convince the Government of the
A shortage of scrap, the association
offered to buy, at reasonable prices, all
copper scrap in Australia and gave an
unconditional guarantee to this effect.
“Scrap metal will continue to
get shorter and shorter in sup-
ply in this country. The de-
mand will continue to rise, so
the supply will always be a prob-
lem. A few years ago, for in-
stance, there was an almost
unlimited supply of old-type
washing coppers. With the
introduction of the washing
machine we only get a few a
month now for scrap. The
supply of scrap metal will con-
tinue to fall, so that we will
have to fall back on virgin
metals and nobody knows how
long they will last,” said a manu-
facturer.
In its official organ, “Can-
berra Letter”, the Associated
Chambers of Manufactures said
in May that the unrestrained
export of copper had affected not
only the scrap-dealers but the manufac-
turing industry. “Quite apart from the
critical situation facing ingotters and ex-
truders, many of whom have had to lay
off labor and leave plant idle, large cop-
per-users such as the electrical industry
and the builders’ hardware and tool in-
dustry have faced shortages and rising
prices for their raw materials.
“Temporary remedial action of some
kind is needed immediately to prevent
any worsening in the present situation,
at least until supplies of virgin copper be-
come more plentiful. The Government
is aware of its responsibility to ensure
that industry obtains its essential supplies
of raw materials. The present precari-
ous supply position is being aggravated
by an upsurge in exports of scrap. Gov-


ernment action, which will immediately
rectify the position, is necessary and justi-
fied in the interests of ensuring continu-
ation of present levels of industrial acti-
vity and the prevention of price in-
creases.”
Railways are a vital source of scrap
metal for the industry. One manufac-
turer said that, were it not for the rail-
ways earlier this year, he might have had
to close his plant down until more plenti-
ful supplies of scrap were available.
NSW Government Railways, for in-
stance, sells each year about 16,000 tons
of ferrous and 6000 tons of npn-ferrous
scrap metal. In 1961-62 it returned them
£675,196.
Not everyone agrees with the associ-
ation’s concern about copper exports.
The director of the Associated Chambers
of Commerce of Australia, Mr R. Pel-
ham Thorman, called its requests “far-
cical”. He said if export restrictions
were applied on copper “a dangerous
precedent would be set for interference
in the market for any commodity in
international trade. It is the proper role
of the Government to provide adequate
protection for economic and efficient
Australian industries after thorough and
impartial examination by the Tariff
Board.
“It is not its proper function, how-
ever, to impose arbitrary restrictions on
exports in an attempt .o control the level
of commodity prices. It is incompre-
hensible that a call for an export ban
should be made at a time when Aus-
tralia so urgently needs new and expand-
ed export outlets,” Mr Thorman added.
\ further conflicting viewpoint comes
from the scrap-metal merchants,
those who buy and sell scrap metal but
do not process it into ingots. Some
merchants feel the Non-Ferrous Associ-
ation wants the scrap-metal business “all
their way”, as one put it. A merchant
said if export restrictions were placed on
scrap metal the metal producers would
have complete control of the market in
Australia.
“We feel that if the manufacturers
were prepared to pay a fair and reason-
able price for non-ferrous scrap, if ex-
port was limited, then we would agree
to their demands for restrictions. But
if this was so, we think the position
would revert to what it was before ex-
port controls were applied, when the
only market we had was Australia. For
too many years they controlled the busi-
ness. Because no export was permitted
they paid their own price for scrap metal
and we had to accept it to stay in busi-
ness.
“I don’t think restriction of exports
is a good idea because Australia is a
copper-producing country. We should
really be encouraging users to take more
virgin copper to boost a base industry.
“If export controls were applied we
would feel that we were being treated
unfairly—it would be scandalous. There
is no reason to control the export of
scrap metal as long as users here pay
a price equitable with that charged over-
seas. If there was a complete ban it
would place the scrap merchant at the
mercy of the users. They would place
only an intrinsic value on the metal they
bought. They would also buy less virgin
metal, which would in turn depress the
value of scrap metal. Apart from this
it would have a disastrous effect on the
industries using these materials.
“There does not seem to be a grave
shortage of non-ferrous scrap metals in
Australia. We offered a large parcel to
a couple of manufacturers who turned
the offer down, saying they had enough
scrap. We work on the policy of giv-
ing local consumers first refusal and
then, if they do not want the metal, we
export it mainly to Japan, but also to
India and Europe,” the merchant added.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Taxation Levels and GNP
Sir,
Your “Economics Anonymous” of
July 25, “How High are Australian
Taxes?” calls for some criticism. It
examines what I believe to be a slipshod
piece of special pleading in the Institute
of Public Affairs Review.
Entirely ignoring a whole book of ana-
lysis of the Australian tax system and
proposals for its reform, the IPA Review
reacted —like the proverbial bull to the
red rag—to a passing factual statement
that the ratio of taxation to national
product in Australia is lower than in
other western industrial countries.
Every international comparison in
economics can be said to “greatly over-
simplify what is, in fact, an intricate and
difficult exercise”. Our international
comparison of tax ratios (taken in the
main from a study by the National Insti-
tute of Economic and Social Research,
London) is no exception. But my col-
leagues and I are not much impressed by
the particular objections raised by the
IPA.
In effect, they make five points,
(i) Some countries, like Germany, have
higher tax ratios than Australia because
they have more extensive government-
financed pension and other social welfare
schemes. (ii) Other countries, like
Sweden, have higher tax ratios because
they have more extensive State educa-
tion systems, (iii) Among the western
countries with higher tax ratios than
Australia, two (United States and
Canada) have higher per capita incomes,
(iv) Among the western countries with
higher overall tax ratios than Australia,
three (France, Belgium, Canada) have
lower ratios of personal income tax to
GNP. (v) “The burden on the present
taxpayers is all the greater” in Australia
because here much public investment is
financed from taxation.
The first two points are quite valid—
it would be surprising if the countries
with higher tax ratios did not have
something to show for them in the form
of more extensive government welfare,
education or other services. But it is
hardly necessary to point out that they
give little comfort to anyone who should
wish to argue against better government
social welfare or education services in
Australia on the ground that taxation
is already too high. The force of point
(iii) is considerably .veakened by the
fact that all other western countries with
higher tax ratios than Australia—Ger-
many, Austria, Finland, Norway, France,
Sweden, Luxemburg, Britain, Nether-
lands, Italy, Denmark, Ireland and Bel-
gium—almost certainly have lower per
capita incomes than Australia.
The force of point (iv) is similarly
weakened by the fact that five other,
and no less respectable, western coun-
tries—Britain, United States, Sweden,
New Zealand and Netherlands—have
higher ratios of personal income tax to
GNP than Australia. Point (v) we quite
fail to understand; we cannot see why
the burden on any of us of £lOO income
tax is greater if the Government spends
the money to build roads than if it
spends it on salaries of public servants
or old age pensions.
We were surprised to find the IPA
trying to revive Mr Colin Clark’s dis-
credited “25 p.c. Law” a decade after it
had been given a decent burial (see, e.g.,
Pechman and Mayer, “Mr Colin Clark
on the Limits of Taxation”, Review of
Economics and Statistics, August, 1952).
We can only assume that they would
wish us to regard Western Germany,
with its 34 p.c. tax ratio and its 7i p.c.
rate of growth as the exception which
proves the rule that “when taxation
exceeds 25 p.c. of national income people
start to ‘set store on leisure’ and restrict
enterprise and output”.

Wool Plan Challenges Futures Trading
For ward dealings have really acted as buffer
By P. KOFLER
1n the midst of expectations and un-
certainties, the Wool Board’s market-
ing proposals were very briefly outlined.
The major suggestion, of course, was
the implementation of a reserve price
scheme with an initial capital of £Bom.
£2om. to be grower-financed, the
balance coming by way of loans from
the Government, Reserve Bank and
trading banks. It should be emphasised
that industry acceptance has yet to be
obtained.
The imposition of such a marketing
system has been labelled “conservative”.
Indeed, it is primarily aimed to in-
corporate a minimum price floor to
actual wool auctions. Large scale
vagaries are natural market symptoms,
as the table indicates.
WOOL PRICE TRENDS
(Average Price per lb. Greasy)
Period d./lb.
1956-57 79.66
1957-58 62.45
1958-59 48.57
1959-60 57.78
1960-61 52.06
1961-62 54.13
1962-63 58.96
1963-64 69.70
Many woolgrowers have become
accustomed to this price pattern, some
because they have had to. There are,
however, numerous adherents of the
auction system who consider windfall
market gains obtained in one year com-
pensate for the lower prices received in
the following year. In consequence,
these growers would contend that, during
the specified period referred to above,
an average eight-yearly price level of
60.41 d. per lb. would be adequate.
History has substantiated this line of
reasoning, yet the general uncertainty
as to future wool prices calls such
judgments in question.
Many industry leaders contend that,
since total wool production has always
been consumed, the problem is not to
sell wool but simply to obtain the highest
possible prices. The following table of
consumption, in terms of million lb.
greasy equivalents, supports this view-
point.

Less world consump-
tion 2763 3143 3282 3292
Net change in "com-
mercial" stocks (excl.
strategic reserves) 31 22 95
The pattern has continued during the
last two years, so that consumption and
production levels have been closely
balanced. It is wrong to assume that
such a situation will necessarily continue.
The increasing importance of synthetic
fibres like nylon, orlon and terylene
makes it difficult to visualise a perpetual
sellers’ market.
How have woolgrowers and con-
sumers been able to reinforce themselves
against price movements? Some com-
panies accumulate large reserves to
provide for depressed market conditions.
Others have recently begun to utilise
futures trading facilities.
The Sydney Greasy Wool Futures
Exchange is today the world’s busiest
wool futures trading centre. It deals with
forward quotations on standardised wool
types, according to the specified ex-
change trading months. A Sydney
futures contract is defined as “the greasy
equivalent of 3000 lb. clean weight of
combing wool (approximately 15 bales
or 5000 lb. of greasy wool)”. The
standard wool type quoted is of “64’s
quality Good Topmaking Merino Fleece
Wool of good to average length—CWC
(Commonwealth Wool Committee) type
78”. Premiums and discounts are
allowed for types above or below this
standard.
ITlhe exchange deals primarily in paper
assets. No large quantities of wool
stocks actually change hands. Indeed, the
whole purpose of futures trading is to
provide a hedge against possible price
fluctuations and not to act as a
physical wool auction centre. The
fundamental premise is that futures
quotations closely follow wool market
values. If in fact this does not occur,
then the essential principle of futures
trading must collapse.
Hedgers use futures contracts to
implement the exactly opposite trans-
actions they normally undertake in the
actual wool market. In this way risk
is considerably reduced. For example,
if a textile mill expects to purchase large
wool inventories during February, 1965,
it will be advised to sell March futures
contracts for an equivalent quantity,
the number of contracts being actually
dependent on both the wool type and
quantity. It is imperative that hedgers
liquidate their futures contracts before
actual trading months appear.
The imposition of a reserve price
scheme could materially affect wool
futures brokerage houses by greatly re-
ducing the need for futures trading
facilities. Reserve prices would be
fixed to prevent possible wool market
collapses. At the same time, value trends
would be stabilised. During depressed
wool market conditions, the wool
authority would be forced to accumulate
large stocks, thereby guaranteeing the
minimum prescribed prices. As the
market commenced to rise, inventories
would be carefully depleted. This would
act as a buffer against substantial price
increases. Overall, there would be con-
siderable reductions in price variations.
The real influence of the implementa-
tion of a reserve system would depend,
to a large extent, on the type of people
actively engaged in futures trading. If
the market comprises a well-propor-
tioned mixture of speculators, wool-
buyers, woolgrowers and textile mills,
then clearly the effect would be severe.
Should speculators predominate, the net
effect would be negligible.
No comparison can be made with
the New Zealand and South African
systems as neither possess local futures
exchanges.,
Hope for Flourmillers
Ohareholders of Geo. Fielder and Co.
Ltd watching their shares teetering
above par may take some heart from
the preliminary report by Gillespie
Bros Holdings Ltd.
Gillespie reported that, in the last
eight months of its year to June, sub-
stantial bulk export orders allowed most
Australian flour mills to run close to
capacity.
Together with a satisfactory increase
in local trade, Gillespie was able to pro-
duce an increase of about £25,000 to
£195,000 net profit. Earning rate will
approximate 19.1 p.c., compared with
dividend rate of 9 p.c. for the third year
in a row.
The overall improvement was mostly
due to good profits in milling, although
income from investments (notably a one-
third interest in Mowbray Pty, which
makes “Daffodil” margarine) rose from
£50,489 to £60,000.
Gillespie 10s. shares are approximately
three times par on the market, to yield
3 p.c.
Fielder’s year ends on September 30
and results are not usually known until
December. Meanwhile the shares should
be worth watching.

MARKET POINTERS
Be Guided by Profit Performance
And don’t forget the merits of “blue chips "
AlTar nerves aside, the local share mar-
" kets have been a little cautious
while awaiting the news of the Federal
Budget.
One Sydney sharebroker pointed out
in a pre-Budget circular that the Budget
would be less expansionary than last
year’s (or relatively restrictive), but unless
the Government intends to rely more on
monetary than fiscal changes, the share
market should not be unduly disturbed.
The Federal Government, of course,
indicated before the Budget that it was
very keen on the use of monetary policy.
It is obvious, though, that monetary
policy must go hand-in-hand with taxa-
tion policy.
★ ★ ★
A n important point being made by
sharebrokers is that, despite interest
rates or taxation, Australia is now in the
annual balance-sheet season, which
means that shareholders and investors
should base their investment programmes
on performance.
Although “blue chip” industrials have
not enjoyed the support given to the rest
of the market, there are suggestions now
that some of the solid, better-known in-
dustrials could have been neglected.
One Sydney broker goes so far as to
say that the shares in three of Aus-
tralia’s largest and best-known companies
are unusually attractive. The shares are
ACI, BHP and CSR.
The broker’s argument is based on the
past six years’ share price history of the
stocks, plus an examination of earnings.

Howard Smith absorbs A. Goninan
The offer from Howard Smith Ltd,
shipper, collier, engineer and sugar
miller, to buy the 76 p.c. shareholding in
A. Goninan and Co. Ltd which it does
not already hold, means the loss of in-
vestment identity of that highly regarded
manufacturing structural and general
engineer from Newcastle.
Goninan’s capital of £1,036,262 after
the bonus of last October, which in effect
gave holders of each 12s. share two ten
shilling shares instead, compares with
Howard Smith’s total capital of
£4,354,550, including £250,000 of pre-
ference shares.
As Howard Smith already holds 24
p.c. of Goninan’s capital, and has two
directors on Goninan’s board, Goninan
is in no position to resist the offer, if
indeed it wanted to do so.
On the basis of exchanging three
Howard Smith 20s. shares for every
four Goninan 10s. shares, Goninan
shareholders (who have been given no
reason to believe they will receive any
more than a 12 p.c. dividend in respect
of 1963-64) would receive a 25 p.c.
improvement in dividend income by
accepting the offer.
Until the year to December, 1963, in-
vestors were not given any evidence by
Howard Smith of great success in trad-
ing. Earnings just covered the 10 p.c.
dividend by a whisker, and even failed
to do so in 1959-60. It was the strong
investment portfolio which accounted for
the respect given to Howard Smith, as it
was the partial source of a couple of
recent bonuses.
Only in 1963 did Howard Smith pro-
duce a respectable earning rate (16.1
p.c.), largely due, it is suspected, to the
prosperity of the sugar subsidiary, Aus-
tralian Sugar Co. Pty.
Howard Smith may be taking advan-
tage of a prosperity relatively rare for
this company to engulf A. Goninan
while the latter is having an unusually
quiet trading period. If the merger re-
sults in greater efficiency in Howard
Smith’s activities, and a higher standard
of reporting to the public, well and good.
Fodder for Fertilizer Shareholders
Australian Fertilizers, the Sydney-
based associate of ACF and Shirleys
up in Queensland, will “approach share-
holders” to help finance a £3.2 million
expansion programme. Now this could
mean floating a debenture or note issue,
hut it is fairly well on the cards that a
share issue is what the directors have in
mind. The last was in early 1963. It
was a one-for-three and the 20s. shares
carried a ss. premium.
This time the ratio is likely to be
much more generous, yet any new shares
will probably carry a substantial pre-
mium. Why? In the first place, the
£3.2 million to be raised is far in excess
of the present paid capital of just more
than £2 million, so a high ratio will be
needed to get the necessary cash. Of
course, shareholders will only contribute
part of the total. Even so, the deal
should be better than one-for-three. The
recent three-for-four issue by ACF and
Shirleys may be taken as some indica-
tion, although it is doubtful whether
such a high ratio will exist in this case.
A larger than ss. premium also seems


logical. The scrip can easily support
it, as market prices are currently around
85s. In addition, if part of the cash is
raised through a share placement with
some institution, there will be a big
overall jump in paid capital. The higher
the premium on a placement and a
shareholders’ issue, the smaller this jump
will be.
As the new cash will be used mainly
in building Australia’s largest sulphuric
acid plant within two years at Port
Kembla, and also for nearly doubling
superphosphate production to a million
tons a year by 1966, returns from the
expenditure may take three or four
years to reach a full rate of profit. In
the meantime, earning rates will suffer.
Last year they rose from 15.9 p.c. to
16.4 p.c. to give double cover for the
steady 8 p.c. dividend. So, although
paid capital would have to be doubled
before the payout was endangered, earn-
ings could still be in for a substantial
flop initially. If loans or debenture
issues are made, any result will be sub-
ject to interest charges, too. On present
indications, the most likely move, as far
as shareholders are concerned, is a one-
for-two issue at a 20s. premium.
Not Australia Fair
advent of large new hotels —such
A as the Chevron Hilton, Menzies and
the Town House —and motels to the
Sydney scene is the major cause of the
decline in business for the one-time
leader, the Australia Hotel Co. Ltd.
Repeated reference has also been
made to the speed of air travel affecting
the demand for accommodation.
From a peak profit of £166,326 in
1959-60 (year to June), results have
fallen away to £3267 for the year 1963-
64. Dividends have been reduced in
each of those years from 15 p.c. to 12i
p.c., to 10 p.c., 8 p.c. and finally nil.
Restaurant business was affected by
lower bedroom occupancy. The ban-
queting and bar trade was as good as
ever, thanks to the hotel’s central posi-
tion in Sydney.
The company’s present plan is to re-
design the ground floor to acquire a
fresh image, alter the restaurants and
public rooms, and to lease some of the
bedroom space on the second floor as
offices. (The whole hotel has been air-
conditioned in recent years to combat
the competition from new hotels.)
At 1963 balance date, a large deficit
working capital position was evident.
Bank overdraft was £258,000 and long-
term borrowings £450,000.
The conclusion can be drawn that the
alterations which the company now pro-
poses to make to the hotel may impose
severe strains on liquidity. Earnings
could be worse before they are better.
Completion of the Qantas hotel will
drain away more custom from the Aus-
tralia.
Present market price of 4s. 3d. for the
4,034,455 ss. ordinary shares puts a
value on the company of approximately
£890,000 (including the £33,000 of pre-
ference shares). At the end of August,
1960, the market assessed the company
at around £3.4 million.
Ripe for a Handout
Oydney building contractor Paynter
and Dixon Industries Ltd had a
highly successful year to June 30,
judging by the preliminary statement
which disclosed an earning rate of 37.9
p.c. on capital.
Profit rose 11 p.c. from £129,177 to
£142,546. aft°r tax of £98,782 and de-
preciation £7424.
Sales in the second half were “sub-
stantially greater” than the previous
corresponding period. Rent from two
newly acquired properties at Mascot and
Alexandria contributed to profit in the
second half and will continue to do so
in the future.
Through the vicissitudes of the build-
ing and construction industry in the last
few years, Paynter and Dixon has made
steady progress.
A two-for-five bonus was distributed
in October, 1960, after the company
produced an earning rate of 32.8 p.c.
on capital. Paynter and Dixon looks
ripe for another handout. The ss. shares
are not excessively high at 275., where
the income yield is 3.4 p.c., assuming
continuance of the 18 p.c. dividend.
The omission of any reference to the
final dividend (interim 9 p.c., previous
year interim 1\ p.c. and final 10 p.c.)
in the preliminary statement could be
a clue that directors are reviewing the
capital structure.
No Issue from Cuming?
Tt seems fairly apparent that Cuming
Smith, the Melbourne-based inves-
tor in the fertiliser industry, will not be
issuing to shareholders to raise the
finance necessary for its expansion com-
mitments in WA. It has a third interest
in Cuming Smith Mount Lyell Farmers
Ferti’izers, which is building a £5 mil-
lion fertiliser plant and which, in turn,
has a 20 p.c. interest in a £5 million
ammonium and nitrogenous materials
complex. So CSML’s total commitments
are for £6 million. As Cuming Smith
owns a third of the firm, it is up for
about £2 million.
The recent interim report announced
an increase in the half-yearly dividend
from 6i p.c. to 7 p.c. This indicates
that 1964 will be the fourth year of
higher payouts for shareholders. In 1960,
dividend was raised from 8 p.c. to 9 p.c.,
1961 10 p.c., 1962 121 p.c. and 1963
131 p.c. This practice has been part of
the directors’ policy to distribute most of
the profit to shareholders —last year’s
13i p.c. payout was only covered by
earnings of 14.2 p.c.
The higher interim distribution reflects
the better performance which directors
are expecting this year. They say in-
vestment income rose in the six months
to June 30, but point out that most
revenue rolls in during the second six
months.
However, it may also indicate that no
share issue is planned to finance the WA
expansion. With such a narrow cover
for dividends, any capital increase would
reduce this margin to a negative figure.
Of course an issue may be under con-
sideration on a deferred dividend basis,
or with plans to substantially reduce the
present payout. Issues under such
terms are not usually of very great bene-
fit to the shareholders’ pockets.
Transpec’s Big Premium
a company that is basically only a
A distributor or middle-man for import-
ed goods, 3s. 3d. seems rather a large
premium to stick onto the ss. par value
of its shares in a public float. But this
is what Transpec Ltd, a Melbourne-based
transport equipment supplier and engin-
eer, intends doing. The prospectus
should be out sometime in October.
Its activities cover three main spheres
—supplying road equipment manufac-
turers with technical advice, installation
and design services; chassis engineering,
and acting as agent and distributor of
specialised components required by local
manufacturers. About 75 p.c. of the
products handled in this business are
imported by the company.
However, the reliance on “middle-
man” activities may not be quite as
heavy as this. As the company must
service and maintain these products once
they have been sold, only about 60 p.c.
of its annual £BOO,OOO turnover actually
derives from the initial import sales.
Thus 40 p.c. of turnover comes from the
firm's own manufactured items, the ser-
vices it provides and the specialised
maintenance work it does on the im-
ported goods once they are sold.
It would be wise for any would-be
investor to remember that this set-up
will have a two-fold effect on the com-
pany’s fortunes in bad, and good, times.
Bad times, for instance, will normally
bring about reductions in demands for
the goods bought in from overseas by
the company. This will have an initial
detrimental effect on turnover. But then
profits from the local activities will also
suffer —fewer imported specialised goods
logically means a lowered demand for
service and maintenance from the com-
pany. To any firm, one blow to turn-
over is bad, two can be dangerous.
In the long-term, the possibility of
local engineers manufacturing these
specialised products cannot be forgotten

either. Despite this and all other argu-
ments, though, the issue of 250,000
shares will undoubtedly be oversubscrib-
ed. Investors will be attracted by the
fact that directors are retaining about
75 p.c. of the capital in their own hands.
Whether or not this is a fair thing to
do is debatable, but it does ensure a high
and steady market for the scrip when
only one-quarter of it is available to
the public.
Then again, the earning rate last year
of over 20 p.c., the predicted dividends
of 10 p.c. and the high state of pros-
perity which the transport industry gen-
erally is enjoying, will all add up to mak-
ing an Bs. 3d. payout for each share
quite bearable.
Remoulded Dividend?
Maybe Moulded Products' shareholders
may see their 14-year-old 14 p.c.
dividend raised this year. In the six
months to June 30 (balance date is
December 31) net profit jumped from
£IOI,OOO to £179,000. And for plastics
manufacturers, the December half-year
is usually more profitable.
Moulded, for instance, earned
£284,000 in the latter half of last year.
Even if this figure is not improved on,
profit will eclipse the previous record of
£406,000 earned in 1960 —adding
£179,000 to £284,000 gives a total
£463,000.
Whatever happens, the 1964 perform-
ance can't help but surpass the £385,000
earned last year. As this equalled a
healthy 19.3 p.c. on capital, any further
increase is going to leave more than
ample scope for lifting the 14 p.c. divi-
dend rate.
O Mighty Weed!
Perennial cancer scares notwithstand-
ing, Philip Morris (Aust.) Ltd profit
for the year to June advanced 36 p.c.
from £388,868 to £529,348.
The three major brands, Philip Morris,
Alpine and Marlboro, gained increasing
shares of their particular markets. Other
brands have been added to the range.
Philip Morris has never before been
so prosperous—earning rate is 31.1 p.c.
on capital of £1.7 million. Tax provi-
sion was enlarged from £250,000 to
£345,000 and depreciation was increased
from £94,680 to £104,693.
The stock market appreciated the
news, putting the shares up Is. 6d. im-
mediately to 425. 6d. Earnings yield
there is 14.7 p.c., income return on a
10 p.c. dividend basis, 4.7 p.c.
More FCA Records
piNANCE Corporation of Australia
Ltd, headquartered in Adelaide,
must have established some sort of
record amongst Australian companies
as a whole.
In the 10 years of its public history
it has reported higher profits each year.
While this must be a source of great
pride to the management, it is of great
satisfaction also to the Bank of Adelaide,
which, holding 40 p.c. of the financier’s
capital, last -year derived almost half its
profits from this investment.
FCA’s earning rate declined from 19.1
p.c. to 18.3 p.c. in the latest year to
June, under the influence of the one-for-
five par issue made in April, 1964.
The profit rose from £380,522 in
1962-63 to £443,020, after providing
£315,742 for tax. Outstandings moved
up from £24 million to £29 million.
The 10s. shares have sold lately
around 255. 9d., where the income yield
is 3.9 p.c. (dividend rate 10 p.c.) and
earnings yield 7.1 p.c.
Bonny Burns Pliilp
T>urns Philp’s giant stride in profit for
the year to March 31 from
£1,782,145 to £2,034,161 establishes a
new record for its earning rate too.
It is 28.6 p.c. on existing capital, or
22.6 p.c. on capital watered by the one-
for-four bonus of next October 30.
Income from investments rose from
£880,114 to £929,826, but most of the
increase in group profit derives from the
company’s own trading operations. Ship-
ping services were the exception to the
group's general prosperity.
The net result as stated above is before
the company sets aside £200.000 (1963
£250,000) for tonnage replacement,
£125,000 (unchanged) for property re-
placement. and £29,500 (the first such
provision) for plant replacement on the
conversion to decimal currency.
The company’s monster investment
portfolio is extended from £14.242,489
to £15,178,053, the market value of
which exceeds book value by some £13.7
million.
Cleckheaton’s Strategy
The releasing of Cleckheaton’s annual
results when the directors and share-
holders of Mutual Stores were trying to
decide whether to accept a takeover offer
from the company was good strategy,
even if it was not intended. As the value
of the offer was based on peak prices for
Cleckheaton shares and the dividend re-
turns were to be smaller than if the
takeover was rejected, Mutual directors
were only “not unfavorably disposed
to acceptance.
But Cleckheaton’s excellent result and
the increased dividend should at least
maintain or possibly lift the value of
the bid (25.) in the long-term, if not im-

mediately. Profit climbed from £306,000
to a record £339,000, which equalled a
booming 37.2 p.c. on capital compared
with 33.5 p.c. last year. The new divi-
dend, up from 121 p.c. to 131 p.c., is
covered almost three times and makes
the margin between payouts, with or
without takeover, virtually negligible.
The few words which Cleckheaton
directors said about the current year
indicated the possibility of another re-
cord. Mutual directors shouH now be
much more “favorably disposed” to
acceptance.
However, some basic economics cannot
be disregarded. If successful, Cleck-
heaton will pay 6s. for each share (after
Mutual's reconstruction), which Mutual
claims have a net tangible asset back-
ing of 9s. each. Actually Cleckheaton’s
buy would be even more favorable than
this as it will also be able to write
some £850.000 in tax losses into its
books.
It is important for Cleckheaton to
buy a company with such losses pretty
soon. The takeover of Eagley Mills in
1960 has given big tax benefits (in 1963
and the latest result, the provision was
a mere £30,000), but these must have just
about petered out. If normal tax is pay-
able, the 1964-65 profits could fall sub-
stantially.
New Role Pays Less
\ change in policy by Lend Lease
Corporation Ltd has greatly altered
the character of this company as an
investment.
Development projects are now con-
sidered as long-term investments rather
than short-term trading assets. This
spreads development profits over a
longer period, though directors consider
it will substantially strengthen the long-
term interests of shareholders.
Reflecting this, profit for the latest
year to June fell for the second succes-
sive year —from £580,693 in 1961-62
to £564,694 and now to £501,555. The
latter result gives an earning rate of 13.3
p.c. on capital, compared with 16.7 p.c.
and 21.5 p.c. going back to 1961-62.
Two major projects were completed
during the year and retained by Lend
Lease.
The 1962-63 result was affected by
economic uncertainty and abnormal
weather conditions. These conditions
did not operate in the year just ended.
Depreciation and amortisation charges
were rather more in 1963-64 than 1962-
63, while tax provision was rather less.
The lightweight aggregate plant of the
industrial division was written down by
appropriating £250,000 from accumula-
ted profits.
Lend Lease has lost its dynamism and
thus can fairly be assessed henceforth as
primarily an income stock. The income


and earnings yields of 4.8 p.c. and 6.4
p.c. respectively from a current price of
10s. 4d. bear out this contention.
Little Margin for Error
Tighter provisions in the new Com-
panies Act compelling companies
borrowing from the public to file returns
at the Companies Registration Office
meant disclosure of profit figures for the
half-year to March by Ampol Petroleum
Ltd.
The company covered its interim divi-
dend requirement of £1,200,614 (7 p.c.
to ordinary shareholders and £30,000
for preference shareholders) by a mere
£43,871.
In May, when shareholders were told
sales had risen 10 p.c. in revenue and
13 p.c. in gallonage, The Bulletin
cautioned that a big profit lift was neces-
sary over the next three years to com-
fortably service capital, which will be
enlarged by note conversions and final
qualification for dividends of the “de-
ferred” shares.
Ampol is counting on the Fort Lytton
refinery coming on stream by mid-1965.
Shareholders are hoping it will be pro-
fitable from an early date.
The shares were 11s. or thereabouts in
May. Under the influence of Wapet’s
cheering reports from Yardarino and
Barrow Island, Ampol shares have
gradually moved to around 13s. —where
they could be vulnerable to any adverse
news from Wapet.
Earning rate based on the first half
of the current year to September is
14.4 p.c. compared with the traditional
14 p.c. dividend. So there is little room
for error.
Taking a Banker
T<he last of the major Australian hire-
purchase financiers to establish a
strong link with banking or insurance
interests, Mercantile Credits Ltd, has
tied up with the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation.
The bank will take a 40 p.c. share
interest by paying 7s. 6d. for 5,600,000
ss. shares, thereby lifting Mercantile
Credit's capital to £4,003,081 and adding
£700,000 to share premium reserves.
In the scramble for finance business,
leaders have found an institutional share-
holding essential for economical borrow-
ing.
Mercantile Credits was sponsored origi-
nally, of course, by the highly rated
Hardie group.
Steane Realisations
the news that R. W. Steane
shareholders will probably get no-
thing from the liquidation of their com-
pany is rather disheartening for them,
it was not unexpected. A statement of
affairs as at February 14 last showed a
surplus of assets over liabilities of around
£60,000 —about Is. 6d. for every ss.
share. However, the estimate was based
on realisation figures for the assets which
have not been achieved.
No one really thought that the assets
would be fully realised anyway. Before
delisting in June, the shares went as low
as 6d., Is. below their supposed value.
The way selling-up has gone so far,
it looks as if even the normal creditors
will be lucky to get all their money back.
Three weeks ago, some outer suburban
industrial land at Glen Waverley went up
for auction. It was passed in after bid-
ding reached only £87,000. Reserve
price is unknown, but the company’s
books place a £105,000 value on the
property. All is not lost, though, as
negotiations are still going on.
Some sources say no asset has realised
its full book value yet, except for some
of the stock. What was left has appa-
rently proved to be obsolete and is
worth way below book value. Plant
assets are rumored to have met a simi-
lar fate. Probably the main determining
factor as far as unsecured creditors’
money is concerned will be the disposal
of uncompleted Government contracts.
The instrumentalities involved will de-
cide whether these can be sold or not.
If they can't be sold at favorable prices,
then unsecured creditors will probably
be in just as bad a position as the share-
holders.
An Early Redemption
■Redemption of £1 million 8 p.c. notes
a year ahead of schedule could mean
that General Industries Ltd has no need
of the money or, more probably, that it
can arrange cheaper finance.
Directors report that the group has
experienced “very satisfactory trading in
highly competitive markets” in the first
half of the current year to February 29.
Sales continue ahead of budget.
Reconstruction of the part of the
Bankstown plant which was burned out
is on schedule and refrigerator produc-
tion will begin before the end of Septem-
ber in Australia’s most modern plant.
The 20s. shares continue to mark time
at around half par.
Good Haul by TINT
The second one-for-ten par issue in two
years is a nice sweetener from rela-
tive newcomer to Sydney lists Thomas
Nationwide Transport Ltd. The com-
pany continues to pay 10 p.c. dividends
also.
Turnover for the year to June rose
26 p.c. to £7.7 million, net profit rose
by 34 p.c. There was, accordingly, a lift
in net profit related to revenue from 7d.
to 71d. in the £.
The company is definitely going
places. It plans to spend £500,000 in
the present year on new TNT distribu-
tion centres and terminals throughout
Australia, in addition to the £225,000
spent in the year just ended.
An earning rate of 20.7 p.c.—actual
profit £244,066 —is more than double
the dividend distribution, thereby help-
ing part of the way with this capital
expenditure.
The ss. shares, now priced at 16s. 3d.,
will average down to about 15s. 3d.
after the issue in September and give an
approximate yield of 3.2 p.c. thereafter.
This is a gauge of their great growth
potential.
Fowlers in the Dark
A forward copy of the address which
the chairman of Melbourne’s Fowl-
ers Vacola plans to deliver to share-
holders at the annual meeting on Aug-
ust 14 fails to show what degree of
profitability the company has attained
since balance date, April 30. It is rather
imperative for shareholders and investors
to be given some indication of this to
be able to accurately evaluate the worth
of the shares on the market.
At present, everybody’s in the dark.
A £62,000 loss was incurred in the year
—the first for 44 years. It was suffered
in the first half but, although reorganisa-
tion and revision in the second half
returned trading to a profitable basis, the
earlier losses were not recouped.
Reorganisation is still going on, but
all the chairman (Mr T. W. Higgins)
says of note in his address is that sales
have increased. If possible he should
reveal at the annual meeting what rate
of profit is being earned on these sales
and whether or not it is likely to in-
crease as the year wears on.
Happy Shareholders
A one-for-five bonus and a lift in
dividend from 10 to 11J p.c. has
been the happy lot of shareholders in
Sydney steel and aluminium merchant
William Atkins Holdings Ltd.
Profit for the year to June 30 rose
36 p.c. from £90,911 to a clear record
of £123,317, representing 20.5 p.c. on
the enlarged capital. Bonus shares,
issued at the end of last September, rank
for the full year’s dividend.
Sales were a record, all subsidiaries
traded profitably and present buoyant
conditions should continue, directors
announced. What more could share-
holders want?
The ss. shares are not unreasonably
high in today’s market at 13s. 6d., where
the yield is 4.2 p.c.
Bonus Prospects?
TT. H. Webb’s record result will again
leave shareholders waiting anxiously

Considering such a benevolent atti-
tude to shareholders, it is hard to see
why this Melbourne-based manufacturer
of funeral requisites, hardware and die-
castings should have suddenly turned the
tap off in 1956. Its record has been
solid and expansive. Since listing in
1949, every year has produced a better
result. The earning rate has moved
generally upward—the two low points
were in 1953 and 1957.
In the latest year to June 30 the
figure reached £112,806, equalling 22.5
p.c. on paid capital—ample cover for
the dividend. As several issues have
been made for takeover purposes, the
directors may have some ground for
avoiding shareholders for so long.
But now the prospect for a bonus issue
is at an all-time high too. At balance
date last year, reserves of £645,000
easily outweighed paid capital 0 f
£475,000. This ratio will be just as
good this year, even though the latter
figure has risen to £500,000.
Lensworth Saves on Tax
Pillowing close on the tail of
A CAGA’s booming result came the
even better performance of Lensworth
Finance in the 13 months to June 30.
The company is based in Adelaide and
is 40 p.c. owned by Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort. Unfortunately the record-
breaking figures were of the non-recur-
ring nature. So there is little direct
benefit for shareholders, who will collect
a steady 15 p.c. dividend for the year.
The 13-months figure was £191,733
(balance date has been changed). On
a normal 12-month basis, it is reduced to
£176,998. This is equal to about 35.4
p.c. on average capital, compared with
23.2 p.c. last year, which represented a
£99,811 profit. The main non-recurring
item is the reduced tax which, because
of losses in a subsidiary,, was only pro-
vided for at 3s. Bd. in the £. The normal
company rate is Bs.
The subsidiary, Melbourne’s Discount
Facilities, was taken over last year.
Losses have now been recouped and
profits are being made under the new
parent.
All this does not necessarily mean that
profits will suffer a setback in the coming
year. To start with, performance will be
augmented by the now profitable Dis-
count Facilities. And the group as a
whole is progressing rapidly. In the
latest year, gross outstandings rose from
£si million to £9 million.
Skimping on Dividends?
TT’s hard to fathom why the SA Brush
Co. has not returned ordinary divi-
dends to 10 p.c. now that operations
are again running at a peak. Back in
1961 earnings equalled 12.6 p.c. on capi-
tal and a 10 p.c. payout was made (in
1960 it included a 2 p.c. bonus distri-
bution).
In 1962, it was cut back to the basic
8 p.c., after earnings eased back to 10.8
p.c. on capital, giving a very scant cover
for the previous dividend. Last year,
when earnings recovered to 12.9 p.c.
above the 1961 level, shareholders put
the continuance of the smaller 8 p.c.
dividend down to conservatism.
Last week’s announcement of a 1964
earning rate of 16.2 p.c. gave them
hope. Flowever, dividend has only been
raised to 9 p.c. On past dividend his-
tory, it actually seems that a higher than
10 p.c. payout was warranted. A few
well-placed questions at the annual
meeting may reveal why directors have
adopted this somewhat ungenerous atti-
tude.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Amalg. Chemicals in Disfavor
Yet prices attractive after speculative nave
Tt may well be that shareholders in
-*• Amalgamated Chemicals Ltd feel
that present prices around 13s. 6d. repre-
sent a marked drop from former levels.
In many ways this is only a matter of
perspective, for after making allowances
for the new issue made in February,
1963, today’s prices are only 13 p.c.
lower than they were two years ago.
But if the price level had kept pace with
the increase in the Sydney all ordinary
index the price today should be about
19s. 6d., so it is perhaps more correct
to consider that the price fall is of the
order of 30 p.c.
Again on an adjusted basis, the price
reached 19s. in January, 1963, fell to
17s. in mid-February and promptly rose
again to 19s. It then dropped to 15s.
by the end of May, rising again fairly
rapidly to 18s. 9d. at the beginning of
September. Falling again to 17s. early
in November, it then rose to reach 19s.
3d. (the high point) early in January,
1964. Since then the decline has been
at least as rapid as the previous rises.
After fluctuating between 14s. and 15s.
for three months from the end of Febru-
ary, it has now settled down to a lower
level between 13s. and 14s. 6d.
I do not know whether there are still
any followers of the Hatch system. If
they were applying the art to Amalga-
mated Chemicals’ shares they would
have been in and out of the market six
times over the last two years, and would
have lost quite substantially. Currently
they would be holders at 13s. 9d. with-
out as yet having had the opportunity to
sell and lose more money. This sug-
gests that, in the past two years at least,
this has been a stock for the speculators
rather than the “growth” stock that it
was alleged to be by many investment
advisers.
TTowever, bearing in mind that many
stocks with good potential go
through periods of market disfavor, this
seems a good time to undertake an
examination of past performance with a
view to deciding whether or not the
shares may now be attractive as the
speculation seems to have died down
and left them at seemingly depressed
levels.
The basic business of Amalgamated is
the formulation and distribution of agri-
cultural chemicals and in this field it has
many years of experience through Blyth
Chemicals which it took over in 1961
together with Lanes Holdings. One
would therefore imagine that it Is well
established in this field and, while it has
some big names such as ICIANZ and
Shell Chemicals (Aust.) amongst its
competitors, there is every reason to
believe that it can continue to meet
competition from these sources.
Despite the publicity that has been
given on a world-wide basis to the
dangers which may exist owing to the
toxic nature of some of the newer insec-
ticides, it is difficult to believe that, in a
world concerned about its ability to feed
its rapidly growing population, usage
of insecticides, pesticides, fungicides, etc.,
will not continue to increase. It seems
highly likely that the rate of increase
could well be greater than the rate of
population increase. It is equally pos-
sible that over a long term this particular
industry will have the earmark of a
growth industry and increase at a greater
rate than the economy as a whole. So
far as Amalgamated is concerned, it is
largely a question of whether current
margins can be maintained.
T'he venture into aerosol custom pack-
A aging is of a much more recent
origin and it can be expected that teeth-
ing problems could well have arisen
here. Prospects of growth here seem
quite dramatic. The figures quoted in
the chairman’s address suggest that for
the next seven years consumption will
increase at an average annual compound
rate of 26 p.c. approximately. Again
it would be difficult to assess the possibi-
lities of current margins being main-
tained. It seems fairly evident that these
have already declined, judging by the
price falls over the last few years in
most aerosol packs.
Unfortunately, comparisons of figures
cannot be made with any precision. The
first accounts of the Amalgamated Che-i.
micals group appeared in March, 1962,
but only included figures for Blyth and
Lanes from the date of acquisition.
Similarly, in the 1963 accounts, profits
for Parco Chemicals were only included
from the date of acquisition and this
is sufficient to make a direct compari-
son with the previous year’s figures in-
valid.
It appears that Parco Chemicals Pty
Ltd made a profit of approximately
£31,000 for the year ended June 30,
1963 (i.e., prior to being acquired by
Amalgamated), and in the previous year
net profit was £40,000. Assuming these
figures are quite factual, that the trend
continues and that profits of Parco are
equally distributed over the year, it is
possible that the Parco company could
have contributed about £10,000 to the
1963 year’s reported earnings of
£430,000.
However, the earnings situation is
clouded by the fact that the tax provi-
sion in 1963 is higher than in 1962,
although net profit before tax was lower.
Comparing the pre-tax profits and
making adjustments for the Parco acqui-
sition, it seems likely that profit of the
comparable group fell by 8 p.c., whereas
sales for the year increased by more
than 10 p.c. Stock and debtors together
increased by more than 24 p.c. Although
this increase could be due in some
measure to the acquisition of Parco, one
is struck by the fact that stock and
debtors increased by almost precisely the
same percentage from 1961 to 1962.
\17hile the period of observation is far
too short to come to any worthwhile
conclusion, there does seem to be some
evidence of falling margins and perhaps
a necessity to increase investment at a
greater rate than sales. In other words,
sales are costing more to obtain and are
less profitable, but this situation is pro-
bably applicable to many companies in
numerous other industries.
Currently the shares yield 5.1 p.c.
from a dividend of 8id. per share. If
the company decides to pay 9d. per share
this year, the yield will become nearly
5.6 p.c. Even the 9d. dividend would
be covered 1.3 times by the 1963 earn-
ings, which could only have included a
maximum of five months profits for
Parco and Cloudust. At these levels
the shares seem attractive but no doubt
most people would prefer to see the 1964
result before deciding on a permanent
investment.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
A Changed Character
Issue from Permeivan Wright?
Beginning as a carrying and general
produce business at Ballarat (Vic.)
in 1863, Permewan Wright Ltd extended
its business to handle almost every con-
ceivable product from farm and station
supplies to footwear and liquor, through
a chain of outlets in the three eastern
mainland States.
When Peters Ice Cream Victoria Ltd
[now Petersville (Australia) Ltd] acquired
Grocery and General Merchants Ltd in
August, 1961, Permewan bought from
Peters the G and G NSW assets.
These consisted of some 70 self-ser-
vice grocery stores, 19 country retail
stores, 15 self-service wholesale ware-
houses and an import-export business.
After that date, Permewan took over
a Yarrawonga retailer, W. J. Gorman
Pty, and Mac's Self Service Store in
North Albury.
During 1963-64 additions to the group
were seven self-service stores of Jans
Bros Pty (Melbourne) and Pays Victoria
Stores (Kerang), four branches of Nash-
Merchants Pty, and eight retail groceries,
189 units all told. Since balance date,
five self-service units of K. V. McPher-
son Pty (Melbourne), two self-service
wholesale units of Norma Trading Co.
Pty and four units of Bruce Food Stores
Pty (Sydney) have been acquired.
Other purchases w'ere a self-service
grocery at Corryong (Vic.), the grocery,
wine and spirits business of Mac Holten
(Wangaratta) and Keith Young (Kiama)
Pty.
The apparent object of all this take-
over activity was to reduce dependence
on the prosperity of rural areas, get into
the basic food industry, and build up a
large chain to give the company sufficient
buying strength to compete on equal
terms with Woolworths and Coles.
In 1962-63, turnover was £lB million,
of which over £9 million was in gro-
ceries. In the latest year to March,
turnover grew to £2l million, of which
£l2 million was in groceries.
The personal liaison with the success-
ful food manufacturer Petersville re-
mains, as the Peters chairman (Mr E.
Christensen) has been on the board of
Permewan for years.
Latest takeover offer is for Petries
Holdings Ltd, the Camden produce busi-
ness, full acceptance of which will re-
quire the issue of 500,000 ss. shares and
payment of £150,000 cash.
The change in accent of the group's
business has been highly successful
financially. In the year to March, profit
rose from £273,481 to £375,218, after
providing £249,666 (1963 £163,962) for
tax and £138,083 (£116,717) for depre-
ciation.
The earning rate has improved from
an average 15.2 p.c. for the three years
to 1962 to 19.1 p.c. in 1962-63 and
22.6 p.c. in 1963-64. Dividend remains
steady at 124 p.c. for the seventh year
in succession.
Shareholders were asked to subscribe
to a two-for-three issue of 20s. shares at
6s. premium in January, 1962, to pay
for the G and G assets. In September,
1963, the shares were reduced to ss.
units.
An issue of £250,000 7 p.c. unsecured
notes maturing in 1975 was arranged
during 1963-64, bringing that item in the
balance sheet to £519,700. There was
increasing resort to registered deposit
money, too —up from £779,820 to
£1,199,649. Bank overdraft receded
from £738,580 to £620,892, while trade
creditors increased from £810,602 to
£1,175,004.
Paid capital at balance date was
£1,506,140 in ordinary shares and
£500,000 in 7 p.c. preference shares
redeemable at par on March 31, 1988, or
at the company’s option after March 31,
1978, at 21s. a share. The prefs. were
only issued in 1962-63. Reserves totalled
£2,071,453 in March, 1964.
Directors explained in their 1964
annual report that the company would
construct a warehouse and new admini-
strative offices on land recently pur-
chased in Collingwood (Vic.), ready for
occupation mid-1965.
A cash issue to shareholders within
the next year or 18 months might be a
reasonable expectation. There were
some hopes that the 124 p.c. dividend
would be improved upon in the year just
completed, but Permewan has plenty of
uses for its funds.
Appreciating the new character of the
company, investors have bid the 5s.
shares up to 17s. 9d. this year (almost
double the 1963 low-point), and they
now sell around 16s. The income and
dividend yields at that point are 3.9 p.c.
and 7.1 p.c. respectively.
On current evidence, they will remain
an excellent investment for reliability and
growth and should still, at this stage, be
sound purchasing.

OLIVER-DAVEY GLASS INDUSTRIES LTD
Purely an Income Stock
Oliver-Davey Glass Industries Ltd
is Victoria’s largest public glass
merchant and glazier. In the group's
latest year to March 31 it operated
through plants at South Melbourne, Port
Melbourne, Ballarat and Geelong. Acti-
vities extend to the distribution of
laminex, fibre-glass insulation and roof-
ing, louvre frame and “Grecon” ceilings.
The parent company was formed in
October, 1958, to acquire the then
privately owned Oliver-Davey company,
which had been going since 1931. In
April last year, activities were extended
for the first time by the takeover of the
privately-owned Stansfield and Smith,


another glass merchant and glazier,
established in Ballarat more than 90
years ago.
Together with a subsidiary paint dis-
tributing company, Stansfield claimed
to be the largest provincial glass and
paint merchant in Victoria. Part of the
takeover was financed by the only share
issue made by Oliver-Davey in all its
listed history. This absence of share-
holders’ issues has always kept the ss.
shares well under 10s. on the market.
But the company’s solid financial history,
especially as regards dividends, has led
investors to treat it purely as an income
stock. For this purpose, it has proved
most successful.
The success has been no small
achievement. As one can quite easily
see, fortunes are tied completely to the
rate of building activity. Nevertheless,
when the “credit squeeze” knocked the
industry so hard and most connected
companies were reporting heavy profit
falls or even losses, Oliver-Davey
managed to weather the storm better
than any.
doubts which beset shareholders
A in 1961 are well reflected in the high
and low share prices of the table below.
But these doubts were shown to be com-
pletely inaccurate —the slides in earnings
in 1961 and 1962 were very small on a
relative basis and, even more important,
the regular 10 p.c. dividend did not
even come close to being endangered.
The lowest point for earnings was 13.2
p.c. in 1962.
Recovery set in last year and the
latest result would have easily eclipsed
the record earning rate in 1960 if it had
not been for the Stansfield takeover,
which lifted paid capital from £260,000
to £300,000. In £.s.d. of course, it did
surpass 1960 —£46,000 compared with
£41,000 (round figures).
In actual fact, the result was much
better than these figures or the earning
rate indicate. This year, for the first
time, the result suffered to the extent of
almost £9OO0 —an amount written off for
improvements to the South Melbourne
property, which is held under yearly
licence from the Crown Lands Depart-
ment. Directors have not indicated
whether this charge will recur in future.
If it does, then it will not be very often
and, even then, probably only when
directors think the year has been good
enough to show the write-off without
making the accounts look too weak.
If this £9OOO is added on to the profit
of £46,000 we get a truer profit (for
comparison purposes) in the latest year
of £55,000. This is the figure on which
the current year’s performance can be
more accurately judged, unless a similar
write-off is made. Of course, the shares
may see a boost next year if a £60,000
profit is announced, as most investors
will be comparing it with the £46,000
figure.
The chairman, Mr J. J. O’Loughlin,
has already said that 1964-65 should be
“reasonably successful”. At the annual
meeting in July he told shareholders that
a “satisfactory” volume of business was
in hand. He emphasised, however, that
conditions were still extremely competi-
tive and costs had risen further since
balance date, mainly because of the basic
wage increase.
Rising costs will be the main limiting
factor to performance this year, and a
close watch should be kept on the
interim report when it is issued in Dec-
ember. Of course, competition is also
nothing to be sniffed at, but the company
will undoubtedly handle it effectively,
exactly as it has been doing to date.
In its six-year history the highlight has
probably been the squabbling over who’s
to blame for the “falling glass” in Mel-
bourne’s ICI building. Such a big con-
tract is nothing strange to Oliver-Davey.
Among others, there has been the famous
Southern Cross Hotel and the new gar-
gantuan National Mutual Centre.
When the company had completed its
ICI contract, panes and panes of glass
fell daily to the street. A writ was issued.
Various authorities investigated and the
opinion is now widely held that it was
not Oliver-Davey's fault. As directors
believe no liability has been incurred,
they have disclaimed same and issued a
counter-claim in respect of the transac-
tion. Generally, most opinions hold
Oliver-Davey blameless.
As the table shows, it is little more
than a high-yielding income stock as far
as investors are concerned. Capital
growth through the market price could
now be only marginal in comparison
with prices earlier on. Unless an issue
rumor is picked up, there is no point
for any substantial price rises, as the
stock then loses its appeal as purely an
income-earner.
However, the chances for an issue of
some sort should not be completely
ignored. To some observers, the very
fact that nothing has ever been done for
shareholders’ capital indicates that some-
thing must happen in the near future. If
an issue is made then shareholders should
not expect one of outstanding ratio. Too
big a capital increase combined with a
bad year could reduce earning rates
seriously and the directors undoubtedly
have the maintenance of 10 p.c. divi-
dends foremost in their minds as far as
shareholders are concerned.

MORETON CENTRAL SUGAR MILL CO. LTD
Chasing Fresh Peaks
A one-for-one bonus in January,
1963, and a two-for-three bonus in
June, 1964, have lifted paid capital of
The Moreton Central Sugar Mill Co. Ltd
from £153,320 to £511,067 within 18
months.
If the 16 p.c. dividend paid for the
last two years can be maintained —direc-
tors made no forecasts —shareholders
would have received a 233 p.c. increase
in dividend income in that period.
The chairman (Mr A. V. Thorp) said
at the 1964 annual meeting that world
sugar prices were expected to remain at
reasonable levels for the time being,
though many factors govern these
prices, particularly European beet pro-
duction and the Cuban situation. Japa-

Moreton Central was established in
1894 at Nambour (Qld), between Bris-
bane and Gympie, to grow and crush
sugar-cane.
It experienced hard times during the
’2os and ’3os. A new era of prosperity
opened up in the 19505, allowing divi-
dends to be increased from 6 p.c. in
1952 up to the present height of 16 p.c.
A revaluation of plant permitted the
doubling of capital in 1963 by a bonus.
In the accounts for the year to Decem-
ber 31, 1963, plant and equipment was
shown at £802,918 at revaluation on
December 31, 1962, £125,078 at cost,
less depreciation £515,547, a net figure
of £412,449. After balance date these
fixed assets were revalued by £429,831,
of which £204,427 was capitalised for
the latest bonus.
There would still be enough left in
kitty for another bonus —a one-for-three
or a two-for-five —when directors decide
that conditions justify distribution.

at cost, less depreciation £2719, a net
£127,971 —which possibly has potential
f or revaluation if the company continues
to prosper.
In the last calendar and financial year,
Moreton Central stepped up earning rate
from 29 to 36.5 p.c. on enlarged capital.
Actual figures for the profit reveal more
of the current boom. The net result was
£111,896 compared with £44,658 the
year before.
The 1963 bonus shares ranked for the
full dividend, which then absorbed
£49.062 paid in a single sum. The
company will be equally generous with
holders of the 1964 bonus shares —they
rank for the full dividend, paid in respect
of 1965.
The company increased tax provision
from £37,000 to £108,000, which looks
generous in relation to the declared pro-
fit —no doubt because of the £40,000
provided for plant replacement before
arriving at the final result. Actual de-
preciation provision moved up from
£36,079 to £46,640.
The provision for plant replacement
now totals £100,000 in the 1964 balance
sheet.

During the 1963 season, 212,464 tons

29,222 tons of 94 NT sugar. This was
6722 tons above the then mill peak of

a projected peak of 35,000 tons in 1966.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Venturesome Before the Budget
Some temptation from cigarette shares
T>y the time this edition of the diary
is published, Mr Holt will have
made known the details of the Budget.
With that hanging over the market, it’s
a brave man (or woman) who ventures
into cigarette shares. Yet Philip Morris
is tempting. Another spectacular result
by this American-backed company now
puts the shares on a 14 p.c. earnings
yield. For consistent profit growth since
1960, Philip Morris and Hanimex must
be hard to beat.
My interest in Hanimex goes back
more than two years. At one stage, I
was holding 2500 shares but this figure
has since been reduced to 1000. In
1962, Hanimex came back on the divi-
dend list, the 10 p.c. dividend being 2\
times covered by that year’s profit. A
similar cover showed up in 1963, when
the dividend was lifted to 12i p.c. If
this dividend cover remains constant in
1964, and remembering that the company
has already declared a 15 p.c. dividend,
earning rate will be around the 38 p.c.
level.
While on this subject of growth com-
panies, ODE rates a mention. Its pro-
fits have been steadily creeping up and
should be a record this year. So also
has the price risen, however. As the oil
exploration industry is coming more into
vogue, this could be a case of changing
market status. Already the earnings
yield has been reduced from 10 p.c. to
9 p.c. and a reduction to 8 p.c. would
not be out of keeping. It also seems
only right that the portfolio should have
some investment in the oil industry. Thus
my purchase of 2000 ODE at 7s. lid.
Perhaps it should also contain a direct
interest in oil exploration. AOG in the
high price bracket or Transoil at the
other end could be propositions, but the
sudden changes in the behavior of oil
exploration stocks has me baffled. Gone
are the days when Planet Oil shares,
paid to Is., sold at 6s. 6d., and its only
claim to fame was the CSR backing.
Returning to the industrial stocks, I
took a closer look at William Adams.
In particular, I was impressed by the
1964 report in which there is a wealth
of useful information.
The business is divided into four sec-
tions —merchandising, steel, engineering
and tractors. The biggest increase in
1963-64 sales was by the engineering
division, which recorded a 54 p.c. rise.
Steel and tractors each showed an 18 p.c.
increase. Overall, sales rose by 20 p.c.
to a record figure of £15,700,000.
The ten-year summary shows that,
from, 1957, sales rose consistently until
1962, when the company got caught iti
the recession. Sales was not the only
thing affected that year. Profits collapsed
from £317,000 to £120,000 and the usual
15 p.c. dividend was cut to 10 p.c.
A jolt like this when trading is tempo:
arily depressed is probably good for an-
company. Profits have now more tha
recovered, with the 1963-64 earning rat
being a respectable 24 p.c.
Stock is probably the most interestin
item in the balance sheet. From a
abnormally large amount of £4,300,00
in 1962 it has fallen to £3,490,000 ij
the last two years. With sales risinf
strongly in those two years, the annu,
rate of stock turnover moved up froi
2.9 times in 1962 to 4.5 times in 196-
Some fear has been expressed abou
the conversion of the notes next year,
If an adjustment to profit is made foil
the interest commitment and the notf
issue of £600,000 is added to the ordin
ary capital, the earning rate works out a
just under 19 p.c.
Following the move to new premise
at Chester Hill for the New South Wale
operations and expansion moves in other
States, a further increase in profits seem
likely this year. At least we should ge t
a pretty good idea of the progress in the
first three months at the annual meetin;
on Thursday, August 13. A purchas
of 300 shares at 62s. was made.
Two sales were made during the week
First to go were the Conkey rights, a
11 s. The other sale was of 200 Ne«\
Broken Hill. Only purchased a coupli
of weeks ago, the sudden rise was tot,
good an opportunity to miss out on t
profit of £99.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 New Broken Hill, 114/- ... £112ff
200 Conkey rts, 11/- £101
BOUGHT
2000 ODE, 7/11 £811
300 William Adams, 62/- £946
This brings the credit balance in the
account down to £346.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Canned Fruits’ Radiant Success
Passing unscathed through market perils
A year ago, the outlook for Australian
canned fruit in the United Kingdom
was not rosy.
Including a carryover from the year
before, there was a record quantity of
more than eight million cartons of
canned deciduous fruit to be sold at
home and abroad. America was so brim-
ming with canning fruit that growers
were being paid to strip it from the
trees. European production, some
American-owned, was increasing. The
pressure on the British market had al-
most doubled in the past 10 years. A
further 25 per cent of Australian pro-
duction was yet to come from plantings
approaching maturity. And South Africa
had plunged the market into chaos by
some of the most frantic price-cutting
the UK had seen.
Today, as though spared by the turn-
ing away of a storm, the Australian
dried fruits industry is radiant with suc-
cess. Not only did it come through last
year’s hazards unscathed, but this year,
with an even greater quantity of fruit to
dispose of, it has already sold 80 per
cent of its UK quota and before the end
of the year will have swept the rest from
the shelves. The picture has seldom
been brighter.
One of the morals of this triumph is
that it pays to cultivate the home market,
where sales last year exceeded the ex-
ports. This is not the only lesson to
have emerged and Australia is not the
only country to have learned something.
TTnlike Australia, which exercises
strict control over marketing, South
Africa sells its canned fruit through pri-
vate canners, acting independently, in
competition with other countries and
each other. There was thus no machinery
to brace South Africa against yielding
to the build-up of pressure on the British
market. Last season, when sales were
at their peak and new multiple retail
groups were being formed, South Afri-
can canners panicked and dropped prices
by two to three shillings a dozen cans
(normally worth about 225.) openly, and,
it is suspected, by as much as 4s. in
undercover deals.
In what serves as a standing tribute to
the supremacy of its rival, South Africa
customarily sets its prices a little under
Australia’s. On this occasion they sank
far below them and the market reacted
by snapping up about 5i million cartons
of South African fruit —about H mil-
lion more than in the previous year and
representing the biggest jump in sales
ever recorded by a supplier to the Bri-
tish canned fruits market.
Australia kept its prices at the levels
that had been set at the start of the
season. Although the South African in-
cursion displaced about half a million
cartons of Australian fruit from the
market, the stepping-up of domestic pro-
motion succeeded in creating a place
for it at home. At the same time, the
South African prices were set so low
for much of the season that, while some
firms cleared the year with a profit, the
industry in general suffered a disastrous
loss.
South Africa is Australia’s tradi-
"" tional rival in canned fruits on the
British market, the United States has
always had more potential for destruc-
tion —so far held off by the 12 per cent
Commonwealth preference which both
Australia and South Africa (despite its
new status) enjoy and which looked like
ceasing to dam the American tide before
France defeated Britain’s Common Mar-
ket bid. But the American situation is
changing.
Where the US could once undercut
other suppliers on the British market, a
domestic boom has deprived it of this
flexibility. Last year, when the South
African prices tumbled, America could
not follow them down. Having been
burned, America is this year approaching
the market gingerly, offering only small
quantities and even hoisting its prices a
little in the hope of establishing a peace-
ful premium market of its own.
This year, straitened by last season’s
losses and smarting at their Govern-
ment’s anger over them, the South
African canners have brought their
prices back to normal. Fruit has been
selling fast, values are firm and by the
end of the year Britain will have taken
more than four million of Australia’s
production of about seven million cans
and about the same quantity from South
Africa.
Having failed to beat ’em, South
Africa is now trying to join ’em by
making approaches to Australia for ad-
vice and co-operation. Australian offi-
cials have told the South Africans that
the first step towards the kind of market-
ing stability she herself enjoys is to
achieve unity between canners and
growers. In the Australian industry, the
Canned Fruits Board does this; South
Africa is studying the possibility of form-
ing a board of its own.
Australia considers there is room for
co-operation with competitors in the
United Kingdom. Both sides, for ex-
ample, stand to gain if Australia lets
South Africa have first go at the market
with her new season’s pack, for the Aus-
tralian shipments start arriving on the
scene a bit later, anyway. Selling is
simplified if some of the South African
fruit is already out of the way.
buoyancy of this year’s market in
Britain, with sales and prices at record
levels, may stem in part from the fact
that South Africa’s price - cutting put
canned fruit into many new mouths last
year. Although the fruit is no longer
available at bargain rates many new
customers are continuing to buy it. The
undercutting seems to have helped all
except those who performed it.
Even the success of its drive to push
more fruit onto the home market might
not have enabled Australia to withstand
the South African offensive, however,
had not her position in the United King-
dom been so strong.
In some other commodities Austra-
lia’s reputation may have room for im-
provement, but respect for her canned
fruits is unquestioned—the result of
maintaining top standards and spending
a million pounds a year telling people
about them.
This money comes from three sources
—a levy of 2s. a carton on canners; the
Australian taxpayer, through Australia
House’s Trade Publicity Directorate; and
additional proprietary advertising by
canning companies.
The present composition of the Aus-
tralian canned deciduous fruit exports
to the UK includes 60 per cent pears
and 30 per cent peaches. Peaches are
the more popular and it is in them that
Australia’s future expansion of produc-
tion will mainly occur.
At the same time, efforts are being
made to win similar popularity for pears.
Australia knows how to go about this
in the field of promotion, yet it is not
so easy to find ways of increasing the
appeal of a product that is already, even
the Americans acknowledge, the best in
the world. It is thought, however, that
one of the reasons why peaches enjoy
a margin of preference over pears is
that they come in slices whereas pears


are put up in halves, or caps. Although
pears are more likely to crumble if they
are divided too much, work is being
done that may lead to new ways of pre-
senting them satisfactorily in slices.
Strong as is its position in the UK,
the Australian canned fruits industry
will need all such improvements it can
lay its hands on if the advantage is to
be maintained.
In teaching its competitors, it must
not become out-learned.
The US Farming Picture
What a professor left out
Tust how seriously can professors be
** taken when they address public
meetings?
For instance, Professor Sir Mark
Oliphant may have been simply trying
to introduce a light touch when he said
that plastics were sure to replace wool
in the not too distant future. He was,
after all, making an after-dinner speech
to engineers and similar types in Sydney.
If we do not take Oliphant seriously,
in this particular case, how seriously
should we take Professor K. L. Robinson,
of Cornell University, who is at present
Fulbright lecturer in Agricultural Econo-
mics at Sydney University?
Addressing the NSW branch of the
Agricultural Science Institute, he said
that, if the United States Government
“lifted the lid”, then Australia would
find it very hard to compete on world
markets with much of her farm produce.
He reminded us that the US had
brought in schemes to restrict acreages
of cropping. This had been countered by
fantastic increases in yields.
At present the US had taken 50 to
60 million acres out of cropping
more than the entire acreage planted to
crops in Australia.
“If this were brought back into pro-
duction I hate to think what could hap-
pen to world markets”, Professor Robin-
son said. “These controls cost a lot of
money and have caused a feeling of
frustration among many farmers. How
long an urban-minded Congress will
continue to meet these costs I’m not
sure”.
11/hat the American professor has not
told us, however, is just as interest-
ing. One wonders if his views are some-
how or other supposed to let us know
that we should not kick up too much of
a fuss over the possible repudiation of
the meat argument.
What Professor Robinson must know,
and what he did not say, is that the US
farming picture is not nearly as bright
as he painted it. American costs are so
high that, if the farm subsidies and
controls were lifted, then utter chaos
would prevail. US farmers can only
compete on export markets provided
subsidies are given by the Government
to keep the farmer in business.
The American meat industry proves
the point.
About 20 million Americans are un-
able to buy anything but cheap ham-
burgers and sausages. Yet the American
beef industry cannot produce this cheap
meat and stay in business.
The American beef industry is one of
the few which is not subsidised and con-
trolled. It soon may be.
If Professor Robinson thinks that the
US could compete fairly and squarely
with Australia in both beef and wheat
on world markets then he needs to do
some more research. Americans have a
habit of thinking that they are the big-
gest, most efficient and fastest producers
of everything from toothbrushes to
rockets. The plain truth is that the Aus-
tralian wheat farmer grows his wheat
cheaper than the American, the wheat
is transported to the shipboard at about
one-fifth the American figure, and it is
loaded into the ships faster than any-
where in America.
The fastest grain elevator in the world
is not in the United States at all; it is at
Geelong.
Red China does not buy wheat from
us because of the shape of our heads.
It buys cheaper here and gets better
service.
Of course, if the United States con-
tinues to subsidise its wheat farmers at
home, and then gives the wheat away at
a loss, that’s another matter. Perhaps
we ought to be more prepared for this
double standard of the US in so many
areas of trade, particularly if Goldwater
does happen to make the White Flouse.
But even if he does, it is doubtful if
genuine laissez faire would ever return.
In the first couple of weeks after any
removal of farm subsidies and controls,
the US farm scene would be a complete
shambles. Professor Robinson surely
knows it.
Australia does not get much of a go
really, from the US. Wool is barred
by tariff. Now there is talk of a heavier
tariff on woollen textiles (aimed at Japa-
nese goods, made from Australian wool
probably). There is the quite despicable
vote of Congress to repudiate a meat
agreement less than a year old —a firm
agreement negotiated between the Aus-
tralian and US Governments.
It is all very well to comfort ourselves
with the thought that Johnson has indica-
ted he would veto the Congress Bill. This
is an election year, remember, and Gold-
water is making surprising headway
according to many observers who earlier
ridiculed him.
What we need in this country, per-
haps, is our own Mr Nasty, some politi-
cian as outspoken as Goldwater. For
a start he could produce a long list of
American-owned companies in this
country and could mark them off for
takeover according to worth.
XpACH move then in foreign trade by
the US, which tells the world one
thing and seems to do exactly the op-
posite, could be countered by the take-
over.
Man on the Land is not seriously sug-
gesting that this sort of thing would
really be advisable. What he suggests is
that we need a bogey-man to threaten,
cajole and thump the table.
The real answer, of course, lies in
GATT or similar world trade agreements.
What will Goldwater do about GATT?
There’s an interesting thought.
At any rate what we do not need are
American professors, such as Professor
Robinson, giving us a lot of chatter
about what the US could do if it really
wanted to. Whether it WANTS to or not
isn’t the point. It’s so tied up in the
farm control and subsidy business that
it couldn’t get out without the country
coming apart at the seams.
Professor Robinson ought to find out
what happened to the big scheme some
months ago to export American beef to
Europe. After much drum thumping,
the prospects turned out much dimmer
than any of the American beef envoys
cared to admit.
Egg Marketing Under Fire

Poultry Farmers’ Protection
League apparently feels that most
members of State and Federal- Parlia-

intricacies of egg marketing.
The league is probably right.
It has sent a lengthy question-and-

sation of the egg industry in Australia,
known as the CEMA Plan”.
In general terms the brochure advises

from their tower of promises and face
reality'’.
The arguments may be one-sided, but
nevertheless they are provocative.
Clearly the politicians, and the general
public (who, after all, eat the eggs), do
not know as much about the CEMA
Plan as they should.
The Poultry Farmers’ Protection
League insists that only a man who has
a flock of 2000 birds or more can be
considered a full-time commercial egg
producer. These producers have a choice
in the sale of their eggs.
They can sell under State legislation
through their Egg Board or interstate
under the provisions of the Constitution
which guarantees free trade between the
States.
The league claims that trading through
egg boards is constantly losing the sup-
port of producers.
The producer has become aware that:
• It is good business to create de-
mand and to supply it.
• In the long run there is no added
security in a system of compulsory
marketing.
• The false sense of security which
it creates is in itself responsible for over-
supply and lower returns.
Here are some samples from the
league’s brochure:
Q. How many producers are entitled
to vote in board polls and elections?
A. Less than 50 p.c. of recorded
producers. All interstate traders are dis-
qualified.
Q. What percentage of all producers
could constitute sufficient voting power
so as to influence the board?
A. It could be less than ten p.c. of
the number of producers holding between
them less than five p.c. of all birds.
Q. Did the producers themselves have
any hand in the formation of a Council
of Egg Marketing Authorities of Austra-
lia?
A. No.
Q. Were they consulted?
A. No.
Q. Have producers requested details
of draft legislation likely to affect them?
A. Yes. But they have been refused
it. (It is understood that South Austra-
lian producers have seen the draft legis-
lation.)
Q. Who comprise the members of
CEMA?
A. All members of all State boards.
Q. Who decided on this representa-
tion?
A. All members of all State boards.
Q. Who have expressed themselves in
favor of the CEMA legislation?
A. Most members of most State egg
boards, a few isolated producers and the
Australian Labor Party, which promptly
lost both the Assembly and Legislative
Council seats in the heart of the Vic-
torian poultry industry area, Bendigo.
This last item should catch the poli-
tician’s eye. The particular brochure
which has come our way is prepared
for Victorian State and Federal mem-
bers. It is understood similar screeds
are being prepared for Members of Par-
liament in other States.
The arguments are certainly presented
in an impressive manner, but, of course,
this is only one side of it.
The one question the public would
like answered is: will CEMA provide
cheaper eggs and better eggs?
The CEMA Plan supporters, say that
the increased volume of eggs (with inter-
state trade abolished) will reduce the
present cost of eggs. The Poultry Far-
mers’ Protection League says it will not.
Neither side gives very clear reasons.
The debate in Federal Parliament on
this CEMA Plan, when it eventuates,
should be highly interesting. Yet CEMA
may be insecure because this plan, un-
like any other comparable marketing
plans for primary products, will inevi-
tably require close policing.
There are always a few barley-growers
who sell a few bags outside Barley Board
control, a few wheatgrowers who sell
a bag here and there. These are minor
infractions, since there is small incentive
for dealing other than through the mar-
keting channels.
How is it really possible to adequately
supervise the sale of eggs? Are special
police really going to go around in the
night counting the number of birds on
their perches (a hen tax is part of the
CEMA Plan)? Who is going to pay for
the supervision?
Man on the Land can answer that one
—the public.
]%/|an on the Land also must wipe some
egg off his own chin. In an earlier
article, he perhaps gave the impression
that interstate egg dealers are “rac-
keteers”. Clearly this is not so. They
are simply poultry-farmers doing the
best they can for themselves.
If a majority of growers really want
CEMA, then they have a right to have
it. If the majority do not want any-
thing, then it usually follows that they
do not get it.
A referendum of all poultry-farmers
seems the only fair way to decide the
issue. If such a referendum is held, it
might also be an idea to ask the poultry-
farmers if they want the egg boards, as
they are at present constituted, to con-
tinue also.
Both the wheat and the dairy indus-
tries have clearly demonstrated that or-
derly marketing of a primary product
need not be necessarily bureaucratic. The
wool industry will probably soon follow
suit.
