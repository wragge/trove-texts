BLAIR ATHOLL, WHERE BONNIE DUNDEE NOW SLEEPS IN PEACE
FT was, some say, the death of Graham of Claverhouse that
turned the battle of Killicrankie, 1689, into' a disaster, for in the
moment of victory Dundee was mortally wounded. They carried
him to Blair Castle, and here, in the Blair Atholl churchyard,
Dundee was laid to rest. Near to the churchyard stood the older
Urrard House, from the window of which it is said the shot was
fired that killed Dundee, legend investing the tale with the added
story that he was killed with a silver bullet, as he was believed to
bear a charmed life. The Goose’s Well from which they gave
water to the dying Dundee is also nearby. During its centuries of
existence Biair Atholl has had many distinguished visitors, includ-
ing Mary, Queen of Scots, the great Marquis of Montrose, Crom-
wellian soldiery, “Bonnie Dundee,” General Wade, the Irish road-
maker, Robert Burns and Queen Victoria. In close proximity to
Blair Castle, the village of Blair Atholl has become a popular
resort, and it has suffered nothing from the building limitations
imposed by successive Dukes of Atholl who have thereby contrived
to invest the tiny place with a charm and peace of its own. For
generous comfort and hospitality the Atholl Arms Hotel has
become widely known.

THE FINE ART OF FORGERY.
Wilfred Partington, the author of
Thomas J. Wise in the Original Cloth
(Hale), says that on his first meeting with
one of England’s most famous book-
collectors and bibliophiles—a correspon-
dent and acquaintance of Browning’s,
the friend of Swinburne, Watts-Dunton
and Edmund Gosse—he was instantly
able to spot Thomas Wise as ai “ferret.”
Since ferrets are rarely pink, bald,
chubby or bespectacled one cannot help
suspecting that Mr. Partington is being
wise about Wise after the event:
It was late on a darkening autumn after-
noon in 1919 that I was shown into the
already well-known Ashley Library. My
first impression was of a pink bald head
bent over a large handsome desk against
a background of books shining in the gay
parade of new gilt and many-colored
moroccos. Then a short, chubby figure,
bespectacled and smiling, approached briskly
and greeted me also briskly. My second
impression was of the keenness of the eyes
twinkling behind their large lenses, and
how ferret-like they became searching mine
—as if trying to read their imprint. My
third impression was that this plump, alert,
confident man of sixty years looked re-
• markably shrewd and determined.
The “event” which brought this wis-
dom to Mr. Partington—if such was the
case —was certainly shocking enough:
in July, 1934, two professional book-
sellers, John Carter and Graham Pol-
lard, published An Enquiry, an exposure
which made it clear that Wise, who had
posed as a book-colleptor pure and
simple, was (a) a dealer, ( b ) a “pirate”
and (c) a forger. This, naturally, was
upsetting to Mr. Partington, who had
edited “The Bookman,” a magazine in
which Wise had published articles estab-
lishing the value and apparent authenti-
city of his own forgeries; it was upset-
ting to the entire literary and book-
collecting world, particularly to wealthy
Americans who, from Wise or his
dummies, had bought the forgeries, and
to .the British Museum, which had housed
them amongst its rarities ; and it was ex-
tremely upsetting to Wise, who, after a
brief struggle to restore his reputation,
retired into obscurity* and died.
But the exposure, brought to a crisis
by a letter from Viscount Esher to the
“Times,” came in 1934:
Sir, Book-collectors throughout the
world are still waiting to hear from Mr.
Wise an explanation of the forgeries ex-
posed by Mr. Carter and Mr. Pollard in
their Enquiry into the Nature of Certain
Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets. Those of
us who have bought the forged pamphlets
for large sums of money cannot consent
to leave the matter where it is. Mr. Wise
has said in an interview that “a large pro-
portion of the books are genuine.” It is
only fair that Mr. Wise should tell us col-
lectors which are the genuine ones, and
why. He must have evidence to refute
the careful examination made by Mr. Carter
and Mr. Pollard. That evidence should be
produced. It is clear from the book that
Mr. Wise played a great part in the dis-
tribution of the forged pamphlets, and
therefore must be more anxious than any
of us to pursue the inquiry. He presented
23 of them to the British Museum and 15
to the Cambridge University Library
And though there had been one or two
faint whispers against Wise, long ago
and long forgotten, Mr. Partington seems
to have been a little too keen of percep-
tion on that darkening autumn afternoon
of 1919 when Wise reminded him of a
ferret,
Mr. Partington has, in fact, a leaning
towards a zoological terminology. The
unfortunate Thomas J, Wise, who, one
cannot help recalling, died of a broken
heart, forger of a kind though he was, is
again described as a ‘ferret on page 29,,
the occasion for the phrase being no more
than that as a young man, so Mr. Part-
ington records, he visited bookshops and
asked questions about rarities and values:
“Young Wise in quest of wisdom was as
quick as a ferret after a rabbit.” On
page 36 Wise is seen, when he is tracing
the descendants of Shelley’s and Mary
Shelley’s friends on the chance that they
might possess original manuscripts—
which they did —as “burrowing like a
human mole” ; and Mr. Partington, one
assumes, does not like moles.
We find \ Mr. Partington, whose con-
ception of Wise is of a rogue born and
incurable, going into italics of suspicion
as early as page 31 in his career, and on
page 34, when the young Wise is, to the
author’s disapproval—he compares the
youth to Dickens’s Mr. Carker —doing
well in the City, he is credited, or dis-
credited, with having “a scheme to be
pursued with relentless and indefatigable
vigor”; the scheme, presumably, being
forgery. But the Ashley Library, Wise’s
great collection of bibliographic rarities,
sold after his death to the British
Museum, comprised more than 7000
books and manuscripts, whereas the
total of Wise’s “forged, suspect and
piratical pamphlets,” as compiled by
Carter and Pollard and this later inves-
tigator, is 78 —which suggests that Wise
was about 100 times more interested in
genuine book-collecting than he was in
less-creditable activities ; and one might
therefore assume that the great “scheme”
of his life was simply to collect books, his
forgeries being a regrettable aberration.
The acidulous quality of Mr. Parting-
ton’s biography did not escape the eye
of Bernard Shaw when he read the Ameri-
can edition, and, with a good deal of
outraged comment of his own, Mr. Part-
ington prints Shaw’s commentary in the
present edition. “Why write about him,”
said Shaw, “as if he was Wainewright
the poisoner?” Mr. Partington retorts,
wounded, “I have not written about Wise
as if he were Wainewright. It has never
been suggested that Wise poisoned his
relatives and other people”; on the
whole, a handsome admission from this
biographer.
Apart from the question of whether
even poor Wainewright should at this
date be castigated with extreme moral
fervor, Mr. Partington certainly does
write about Wise as if he had, at least,
boiled his own babies, and had made a
habit of it. His recurrent wrath at the
fact that Wise dealt in bibliographical
wares, genuine as well as spurious, is
surely a trifle excessive. There are very,
very few collectors, whether of pictures
or of books, who do not indulge in a
little profitable dealing in a quiet way,
and if the passion to acquire rare and
beautiful things is combined with or even
seemingly inspired by the natural preda-
tory instincts of commercial men, it is
difficult to see what harm is done. Merely
to secure a bargain is a gratification of
the commercial instinct, and the collec-
tor who would scorn a bargain has sel-
dom been seen on this earth.
Again, Wise’s habit of rebinding his
first-editions in apple-green morocco, a
color which seems to set Mr. Partington’s
teeth on edge, was hardly criminal, and
might well have been more gently dealt
with. Collectors no doubt like to see
their books in their original condition,
and anyone might share with Mr. Parting-
ton a certain disenchantment on finding
a first-edition of Wordsworth’s Poems in
that emetic apple-green morocco ; while
,to bind in that material another copy of
the same Poems which had come from
Southey’s library and which Edith
Southey (herself apparently no respecter
of the “old drab boards” in which the
book was originally bound) had clothed
in one of her old petticoats undoubtedly
savored of sacrilege. But, unless there
is •some special virtue in petticoats, Wise
had done no worse than Mrs. Southey.
Yet again, Mr. Partington can hardly,
with any degree of justice, reproach Wise
for printing, in small limited editions,
various highly scandalous letters of Swin-
burne’s when his own narrative of the
scandal of Thomas J, Wise is prefixed by
the admirable motto from Dr. Johnson,
“If a man is to write A Panegyrick, he
may keep vices out of sight; but if
he professes to write A Life he
must represent it really as it was.”
Thomas Wise, in fact, seems to have per-
formed an admirable service for future
biographers of Swinburne in preserving
this inflammatory but essential material
which Edmund Gosse would like to have
hushed up.
Swinburne, incidentally, roaring his
Rabelaisian curses and writing his un-
printable letters, to be decorated by
Simeon Solomon with drawings “such as
Tiberius would have given provinces
for,” emerges as an unexpectedly lively
character in Mr. Partington’s perplexing
narrative.
As to Wise’s more serious offences, it
would be possible for anyone undertak-
ing his defence (a pleasure into which
Mr. Partington’s vehemence will seduce
most of his readers) to argue that a large
number of the “piracies,” though im-
proper and unethical, were not so terribly
wicked in the final analysis. Wise, for
instance, after Swinburne’s death,
secured through Watts-Dunton a great
mass of the poet’s unpublished work.
There was a verbal agreement between
the parties that, if Wise published the
material, he would ask Watts-Dunton’s
consent. When Wise asked for this per-
mission Watts-Dunton’s interpretation of
“consent” was a cash payment. In many
cases Wise paid up; in others, stating to
Gosse that some of the manuscripts had
been sold to him without restriction, he
did no.t.
Pamphlets so published without Watts-
Dunton’s sanction are regarded by Mr.
Partington as “piracies.” Technically
they may be. But at the worst, in these
cases, Wise was not robbing Swinburne,
who was dead, but was deceiving Watts-
Dunton, who possessed no legal claim
on the copyright. Wise’s “piracies”
here are hardly the same sort of whole-
sale robbery of living authors or their
families which has been practised, with
impunity under U.S. copyright law, by
some unscrupulous American publishers.
There remain the forgeries. These
were plainly disgraceful; in fact, it is
difficult to understand why Wise was not
prosecuted. And yet, had he been
brought into court, he might well have
pleaded for leniency on the grounds that
he was in quite a different class from
William Ireland, the forger of Shakspeare,
or the ingenious De Gibler, who offered
to the public hundreds of letters of
Byron’s which Byron did not write.
Thomas Wise did not produce fake
literary works. He published fake first-
editions.
No doubt, as in an unguarded moment
of benevolent understanding Mr. Parting-
ton admits, Wise’s first step towards this
sort of crime was the completely inno-
cent but obviously dangerous printing of
facsimile first-editions of Shelley for the
Shelley Society. From that point it was
fatally easy to go one' step further and
print a “first-edition” dated earlier than
the true first-edition: which is precisely
what Wise did in the case of Elizabeth
Barrett. Browning’s Sonnets From the
Portuguese and, broadly speaking, in all
his other forgeries.
Authors who received these kinds of in-
dulgence from fhe book-collector —piracy
or publication before they were published
—included Matthew Arnold, both the
Brownings, Dickens, George Eliot, Kip-
ling, William Morris, Rossetti, Ruskin,
Stevenson, Swinburne, Tennyson, Thack-
eray and Wordsworth: a formidable list
and, up to a point, evidence of a genuine
love of literature in Wise which Mr. Part-
ington, dismissing' with much scorn the
additional testimony of Wise’s own
volume of sentimental poetry, is some-
what too anxious to deny.
Shaw’s theory that the forgeries were
“a joke” makes Mr. Partington much
annoyed, and with some reason, for
Shaw has never been altogether success-
ful at expounding the mysteries of the
hignan spirit. But one cannot even rely
on Shaw to be unreliable: he adds, “The
collector complex usually ends in for-
gery, as in Collier’s case”; and here,
though the “usually” is frivolous, there
is something to be said for Shaw’s
theory. The collector is the preserver
of the arts ; sometimes, understandably,
he feels that this most vital function is
not enough, and attempts to create works
of art himself. He does not want to
forge so much as to imitate ; but the
imitation, in Wise’s case at any rate, is
technically a forgery. The temptation to
make money out of his imitations com-
pletes his ruin.
Mr. Partington, being in such a state
of righteous indignation that he is forced
to regard this lover ,of books as a
“ferret” and a “mole,” has written a far
from satisfactory biography, except in-
sofar as it is painstaking, crammed with
facts and, bringing in such incidental
matters as the discovery of , 17 plays of
the late Sixteenth Century that had been
bricked-up in a chimney of an Irish farm-
house, fascinating to anyone interested in
books. In method Thomas J. Wise in
the Original Cloth is involved and baffl-
ing ; in style it is at best adequate, at
times so heated that it vanishes in a cloud
of asterisks, and at its most alarming
descends to the level of: “Wrepn now
attuned, as awed as a girl at her confir-
mation, the three settled down to business
in the study, unconscious of the mocking
spirit of Swinburne, who sometimes
never bothered to cash his publishers’
cheques.”
Collected Conrad .
Some time ago J. M. Dent and Sons
announced that, as their first major post-
war publishing venture, they were bring-
ing out a collected edition of Conrad.
Two volumes to hand are' The Secret
Agent —that masterly novel of London,
quite as good in its own way as The
Nigger of the Narcissus or any of the
great sea stories, in which Conrad showed
the reverse side of his philosophy, ruth-
lessly exposing the petty and squalid
minds of anarchists instead of praising
the fortitude of sailors—and ’Twixt Land
and Sea, containing the long short stories
“A Smile of Fortune,” “The Secret
Sharer” and “Freya of the Seven Isles.”
Each volume contains Conrad’s own
introduction. The books are printed in
large, clear type on good paper, are a
handy size—neither too much thinned for
economy nor too much bulked-out for
impressiveness—and the blue cloth bind-
ing with gold lettering is as attractive as
one could wish. The English price—no
doubt it will be, rather dearer in Aus-
tralia —is 7si 6d. a volume.
Other titles listed as' already published
are Almayer’s Folly and Tales of Un-
rest, Youth, Heart of Darkness and The
End of the Tether, Nostromo, Under
Western Eyes, the Mirror of the Sea and
A Personal Record and The Arrow of
Gold. The rest are to come in batches
of two or three. Victory (which isn’t
Conrad at his best) and The Rover
(which is) are due in the spring of 1948.
English reviews of the series speak of
a Conra4 revival. If that is taking place
and the English, having gone to Trollope
for humor and solid commonsense, go
to Conrad for valor and nobility of mind
and style, they are on the right track to
a national as well as a literary revival.
A Tasmanian River .
On page 28 of Romance of the Huon
River (Whitcombe and Tombs), by Mrs.
Arthur H. Garnsey (Ann Stafford Bird),
we meet a great-grandmother (not the
author’s) who had been a convict:—
She had been a beauty, and her black
eyes could still flash, though her face was
weatherbeaten and furrowed. She knew
the history of all her neighbors, far and
near, and finished many of these tales with
a slow shake of the head and a wink,
which means that the rest of the tale was
not fit for us to hear.
This is, of course, interesting; and the
reader proceeds eagerly to the next para-
graph, expecting to hear some of the
beldame’s stories, at least as far as the
nod and the wink. But the stories re-
main untold.
Throughout the little book this weak-
ness persists. Mrs, Garnsey is continu-
ally saying that she could tell “many a
tale” about the people of the river, or
that the people have told her “many a
tale,” but the tales remain locked in the
eternal silence. The fault is worth not-
ing, not only because it affects the quality
of this book, but because it is common
in autobiographical writing. It is the
substitution, frequently for tactful pur-
poses, of vague generalities for the pre-
cise details which alone can bring the
past to life and make it fascinating to
readers. An allied fault, also noticeable
in Romance of the Huon River, is to
write for the people of the district in-
stead of about them.
When Mrs. Garnsey does get down to
details —of which she offers more and
more as the book progresses—she can
indeed tell “many a tale” ; and these, in
a quiet and simple way, are pleasant
reading. In a chapter on the Huon
timber-milling industry, describing the
work in the saw-pits in the early days,
there is another convict, and this one
comes vigorously to life:
It is a sorry tale of the bush that even
the “ticket-of-leave” women helped at this
work —not willingly, I’m sure. One special
case was known to us of a man who, after
securing his freedom, was working his own
pit, and made his wife go down into the
pit to do the worst part of the work, with
the sawdust falling all over her, while he
stood above swearing at her if she was
too slow. She was his “assigned” wife,
whom he certainly did not love, in fact
disliked badly This couple, though dis-
liking each other so much, produced six
or seven sturdy .• sons and daughters who
turned out well, but his dislike for her
never lessened... .She would roll down her
stockings and show shockingly bruised legs
from her husband’s kicks. One day he
thrashed -a son for kicking a cow and then
came in and kicked her, being in a baa
temper. This was all very strange, for the
old man had really a kind face and was
kind to his animals.
There are, fortunately, enough of such
lively particularities among the general-
isations to hold the reader’s interest. Mrs.
Garnsey’s love for what H. M. Green m
his introduction describes as
most beautiful river” gives the book a
charm of its own: and, taken as a whole,
the picture is admirably comprehensive.
Mrs. Garnsey’s childhood home—lost to
a stranger in the Tasmanian Govern
ment’s fantastic land lottery after tne
bank failure of 1891 —was on the Huon,
and her personal memories reach back,
if not quite to the beginnings of settle-
ment when some Irish immigrants sail
up the river in mistake for the Denver).
through the most vital years of its de-
velopment. She follows the Huon
course from the snow to the sea, s
describes its birds, its fish, its barges an
its wildflowers ; she tells the history
the district and its settlers ; and, m som
of her best chapters, she does a propen)
lyrical justice to Huon pine and nu
apples.

Economical method of treating
posts against white-ants?
All timber that is to be placed in
the ground needs to be treated with
creosote oil. Stand posts in an
empty 40-gallon oil-drum from which
one end has been cut. The drum
is then almost filled with a mixture
consisting of two parts of creosote oil
to one part of crude or fuel oil by
volume. The contents of the drum
(posts and preservative) are carefully
heated by an open fire to a tem-
perature of about 210 deg. F., and
this heating is continued up to four
hours, depending on the species of
timber. Then allow drum and its
contents to cool down overnight.
It is during this cooling-down period
that the oil is sucked into the timber,
the degree of penetration depend-
ing on the dryness of the wood.
Obviously it is advisable to accumu-
late the timber some time before
it is needed and stack it into loose
piles with alternate layers crossing
so that it dries out satisfactorily.

What Australian cricket team to
visit England is considered the best?
We hereby sidestep a Solomon-like
judgment. Armstrong’s 1921 team
has the best record (three wins and
two drawn games), but it was the
first series after World War I, when
the English opposition was very weak.
The 1902 team Darling (capt.),
Trumper, Noble, Hill, Duff, Arm-
strong, Syd. Gregory, Trumble,
Jones, Hopkins, Kelly, Carter, Howell
and Saunders contained the best
array of batsmen ever sent overseas.

The Soviet Wives.
Reference has already been
made here, and* elsewhere in
The Bulletin, to the shameful
business of “Australia” support-
ing Soviet Russia in U.N.O. on
the issue of the Russian wives of
British subjects being refused
permission to leave Russia and
join their husbands.
Australian dailies missed that
item of “Australia’s” perform-
ance in U.N.O. It was reported
by A.8.C., briefly, in one news
session, and anyone might well
have thought there had been
some sort of mistake.
The A.B.C. report, however,
was accurate enough, as far as
it went. American papers, de-
layed in transit, are now to hand
with details of what happened.
The British representative on the
U.N.O. Commission on the
Status of Women accused the
Soviet Union of having violated
a basic family right by refusing
to allow the Russian wives of
15 British soldiers to leave the
Soviet Union and rejoin their
husbands in Britain. But on a
British prpposal that U.N.O.’s
international bill of human
rights should include provision
stating that “married persons
shall have the right to reside to-
gether in any country from
which they cannot lawfully be
excluded,” the voting resulted in
a 4-4 tie and the defeat of the
proposal. In favor were Guate-
mala, India, Britain and Syria ;
against. White Russia, the
Soviet Union, Australia and
China. In the U.N.O. fashion,
the rest abstained.
Meanwhile, a bitter letter
signed by the British soldier-
husbands has appeared in Lon-
don “Times.” The writers sup-
port Lord Vansittart’s suggestion
calling for a final appeal to
Stalin, with the # intimation that
if the wives anti children were
not then released the British
Government would enforce ab-
solute parity in the numbers of
wives and children of Soviet
non-diplomatic staff permitted
in Britain and the dependents of
similar British staff in Moscow.
Referring also to the fact that
several of the marriages had
already broken up, the writers
added: —
It is now or never. If not now
there will soon be no problem of the
“Soviet wives.” submit,
there will be the feeling abroad that
British passports need not b’e taken
too seriously, that the brave words of
the Atlantic Charter and the Declara-
tion of the United Nations are no
more than pretentious humbug.
Further, the Soviet Government will
be entitled to assume that any denial,
however intolerable, of elementary
human rights to British subjects can
be expected to secure the meek and
humble acquiescence of his Majesty’s
Government.
That carries its own com-
ment on “Australia’s” shameful
vote. By the same token, in
view of “Australia’s” choice
company in that vote, is it so
very remarkable that Com-
munists have immunity to play
their destructive part in Chifley
“Australia”?
Hitler to Mussolini.
On the eve of the German
attack on Russia Hitler wrote
a long, detailed letter of ex-
planation to Mussolini. The
letter, like the rest of the cap-
tured Nazi documents lately
published by the U.S. State De-
partment and featured in “Un-
cabled Additions,” B. 25/2/’4B,
has the great value of being
authentic history. Such docu-
ments—the letter here given in
full among them —will be the
material for the final assessment
of Hitler as a figure in history.
Meanwhile, the letter may clear
up a good deal that has been
puzzling in what was certainly
one of the two or three major
decisions affecting the course
and outcome of the war;
June 21, 1941.
Duce!
I am writing this letter to you at
a moment when months of anxious
deliberation and continuous nerve-
wracking waiting are ending in the
hardest decision of my life. I be-
lieve —after seeing the latest Russian
situation map and after appraisal of
numerous other reports—that I can-
not take the responsibility for wait-
ing longer and, above all, I believe
that there is no other way of obvia-
ting this danger—unless it be further
waiting, which, however, would neces-
sarily lead to disaster in this or the
next year at the latest.
The situation: England has lost this
war. With the right of the drowning
person she grasps at every straw
which, in her imagination, might
serve as a sheet-anchor. Nevertheless,
some of her hopes are naturally not
without a certain logic. England has
thus far always conducted her wars
with help from the Continent. The
destruction of France —in fact, the
elimination of all West-European
positions—is directing the glances of
the British warmongers continually
to the place from which they tried
to start the war: to Soviet Russia.
Both countries, Soviet Russia and
England, are equally interested in
a Europe fallen into ruin, rendered
prostrate by a long war. Behind
these two countries stands the North
American Union goading them on
and watchfully waiting. Since the
liquidation of Poland there is evi-
dent in Soviet Russia a consistent
trend which, even if cleverly and
cautiously, is nevertheless reverting
firmly to the old Bolshevist tendency
to expansion of the Soviet State. The
prolongation of the war necessary for
this purpose is to be achieved by
tying up German forces in the East,
so that—particularly in the air—the
German Command can no longer
vouch for a large-scale attack in the
West. I declared to you only recently,
Duce, that it was precisely the suc-
cess of the experiment in Crete that
demonstrated how necessary it is to
make use of every single airplane
in the much greater project against
England. It may well happen that
in this decisive battle we would win
with a superiority of only a few
squadrons. I shall not hesitate a
moment to undertake such a respon-
sibility if, aside from all other con-
ditions, I at least possess the one
certainty that I will not then suddenly
be attacked or even threatened from
the East.
The concentration of Russian forces
—I had General Jodi submit the
most recent map to your attache here,
General Maras is tremendous.
Really, all available Russian forces
are at our border. Moreover, since
the approach of warm weather, work
has been proceeding on numerous
defences. If circumstances should
give me cause to employ the German
air force against England, there is
danger that Russia will then begin
its strategy of extortion in the South
and North, to which I would have
to yield in silence, simply from a
feeling of air inferiority. It would,
above all, not then be possible for
me, without adequate support from
an air force, to attack the Russian
fortifications with the divisions
stationed in the East. If I do not
wish to expose myself to this danger,
then perhaps the whole year of 1941
will go by without any change in
the general situation. On the con-
trary, England will be all the less
ready for peace, for it will be able
to pin its hopes on the Russian
partner. Indeed, this hope must
naturally even grow with the pro-
gress in preparedness of the Russian
armed forces. And behind this is
the mass delivery of war material
from America which they hope to
get in 1942.
Aside from this, Duce, it is not
even certain whether we shall have
this time, for with so gigantic a
concentration of forces on both sides
—for I, also, was compelled to place
more and more armored units on
the eastern border, and also to call
Finland’s and Rumania’s attention to
the danger—there is the possibility
that the shooting will start spon-
taneously at any moment. A with-
drawal on my part would, however,
entail a serious loss of prestige for
us. This would be particularly un-
pleasant in its possible effect on
Japan. I have, therefore, after con-
stantly wracking my brains, finally
reached the decision to cut the noose
before it can be drawn tight.
I believe, Duce, that I am hereby
rendering probably the best possible
service to our joint conduct of the
war this year. For my overall view
is now as follows:
(1) France is, as ever, not to be
trusted. Absolute surety that North
Africa will not suddenly desert does
not exist.
(2) North Africa itself, in so far
as your colonies, Duce, are con-
cerned, is probably out of danger
until autumn. I assume that the
British, in their last attack, wanted
to relieve Tobruk. Ido not believe
they will soon be in a position to
repeat this.
(3) Spain is irresolute and —I am
afraid—will take sides only when
the outcome of the war is decided.
(4) In Syria, French resistance can
hardly be maintained permanently
either with or without our help.
(5) An attack on Egypt before
autumn is out of the question alto-
gether. I consider it necessary, how-
ever, taking into account the whole
situation, to give thought to the de-
velopment of an operational unit in
Tripoli itself which can, if necessary,
also he launched against the West.
Of course, Duce, the strictest silence
must be maintained with regard to
these ideas, for otherwise we cannot
expect France to continue to grant
permission to use its ports for the
transportation of arms and munitions.
(6) Whether or not America enters
the war is a matter of indifference,
inasmuch as she supports our oppon-
ent with all the power she is able
to mobilise.
(7) The situation in England itself
is bad; the provision of food and
raw materials is growing steadily more
difficult. The martial spirit to make
war, after all, lives only on hopes.
These hopes are based solely on two
assumptions: Russia and America.
We have no chance of eliminating
America. But it does lie in our
power to exclude Russia. The
elimination of Russia means, at the
same time, a tremendous relief for
Japan in East Asia, and thereby the
possibility of a much stronger threat
to American activities through Jap-
anese intervention.
I have decided under these circum-
stances, as I already mentioned, to
put an end to the hypocritical per-
formances in the Kremlin. I assume,
that is to say, I am convinced, that
Finland, and likewise Rumania, will
forthwith take part in this conflict,
which will ultimately free Europe,
for the future also, of a great danger.
General Maras informed us that you,
Duce, wish also to make available
at least one corps. If you have that
intention, Duce—which I naturally
accept with a heart filled with grati-
tude—the time for carrying it out
will still b‘e sufficiently long, for in
this immense theatre of war the
troops cannot be assembled at all
points at the same time, anyway.
You, Duce, can give the decisive aid,
however, by strengthening your forces
in North Africa, also, if possible,
looking from Tripoli toward the West,
by proceeding further to build up
a group which, though it be small
at first, can march into France in case
of a French violation of the treaty;
and finally, by carrying the air war
and, so far as it is possible, the
submarine war, in intensified degree,
into the Mediterranean.
So far as the security of the terri-
tories in the West is concerned, from
Norway to and including France, we
are strong enough there —so far as
army troops are concerned —to meet
any eventuality with lightning speed.
So far as the air war on England
is concerned, we shall, for* a time,
remain on the defensive —but this
does not mean that we might be
incapable of countering British attacks
on Germany; on the contrary, we
shall, if necessary, be in a position
to start ruthless bombing attacks on
British home territory. Our fighter
defence, too, will be adequate. It
consists of the best squadrons that
we have.
As far as the war in the East is
concerned, Duce, it will surely be
difficult, but I do not entertain a
second’s doubt as to its great success.
I hope, above all, that it will then
be possible for us to secure a com-
mon food-supply base in the Ukraine
for some time to come, which will
furnish us such additional supplies
as we may need in the future. 1 may
state at this point, however, that, as
far as we can tell now, this year’s
German harvest promises to be a very
good one. It is conceivable that
Russia will try to destroy the
Rumanian oil region. We have built
up a defence that will —or so I think
—prevent the worst. Moreover, it
is the duty of pur armies to eliminate
this threat as rapidly as possible.
If I waited until this moment,
Duce, to send you this information,
it is because the final decision itself
will not be made until 7 o’clock to-
night. I earnestly beg you, there-
fore, to refrain, above all, from
making any explanation to your
Ambassador at Moscow, for there is
no absolute guarantee that our coded
reports cannot be decoded. I, too,
shall wait until the last moment to
have my own Ambassador informed
of the decisions reached.
The material that I now contem-
plate publishing gradually is so ex-
haustive that the world will have
more occasion to wonder at our for-
bearance than at our decision, except
for that part of the world which
opposes us on principle and for
which, therefore, arguments are of
no use.
Whatever may no\v come, Duce,
our situation cannot become worse
as a result of this step; it can only
improve. Even if I should be obliged
at the end of this year to leave 60
or 70 divisions in Russia, that is
only a fraction of the forces that
I am now continually using on the
eastern front. Should England never-
theless not draw any conclusions from
the hard facts that present them-
selves, then we can, with our rear
secured, apply ourselves with in-
creased strength to the dispatching
of our opponent. I can promise
you, Duce, that what lies in our
German power will be done.
Any desires, suggestions and assist-
ance of which you, Duce, wish to
inform me in the contingency before
us, I would request that you either
communicate to me personally or
have them agreed upon directly by
our military authorities.
In conclusion, let me say one more
thing, Duce. Since I struggled
through to this decision, I again feel
spiritually free. The partnership with
the Soviet Union, in spite of the
complete sincerity of the efforts to
bring about a final conciliation, was
nevertheless often very irksome to
me, for in some way or other it
seemed to me to be a break with my
whole origin, my concepts, and my
former obligations. I am happy now
to be relieved of these mental agonies.
With hearty and comradely greet-
ings,
Your
ADOLF HITLER.
“A Grave Mistake.”
Dr. Evatt is no doubt too
busy to be bothered with
correcting the most misleading
impression caused by his
trumpeting of the Palestine par-
tition as an “achievement.” The
correcting, however, is being
thoroughly enough done by re-
ports from U.N.O.
Thus a London “Times”
representative there reports that
“few observers have any doubt
now that the Assembly made a
grave mistake.” That was ‘Hn
conceding a Jewish claim bound
to provoke strong Arab resist-
ance, and at the same time in
encouraging bold Arab resist-
ance by evading the problem of
enforcement.”
The upshot of that display of
weakness is that now whatever
the Security Council may do to
push partition through will
amount to “taking sides in a
civil war which has already be-
gun.”.
Also as to enforcement, the
partition decision was far from
unanimous ; moreover, many of
those who supported it ex-
pressed considerable doubts.
“Recalling the hesitations of
many members who voted for
the partition scheme,” says the
“Times” correspondent, “one
may assume the widespread feel-
ing in their ranks that they
would prefer to be more certain
of the justice of the particular
United Nations cause which is
being resisted.”
Europe’s Self-help.
Promises made by the Euro-
pean countries agreeing to share
in the Marshall Plan could be
briefly summarised as: (1) They
would increase industrial pro-
duction ; (2) they would intro-
duce stabilisation, creating some
balance between prices and
wages; (3) they would co-oper-
ate with each other.
To seb what progress was
being made under those heads,
N.Y, “Herald Tribune” turned
loose a swarm of correspondents
in the different countries. On
stabilisation they reported some-
thing being attempted in France
and Italy; on co-operation, that
“the 16 countries were not try-
ing hard enough to carry out the
programme they promised” ; on
increased production, some ex-
cellent achievement.
Eight of the countries were
found to be producing more in-
dustrial goods now than they
were a year ago. Five of the
eight—notably Great Britain —
are producing more than they
were before the war. The re-
porters found:
British miners digging more coal
every day than they were digging in
1938, French workmen raising auto-
mobile and truck output 42 per cent,
in a year, French electrical production
35 per cent, above pre-war, Dutch
industrial output —which in 1946 was
only 73 per cent, of 1938 —up to 92
per cent, in 1947, Belgian farmers
doubling their harvest of sugar-beets
in a year, a general tendency to cut
imports and feverish attempts to
increase exports.
Also, more land was found to
be under cultivation than a year
ago, with British farmers pro-
ducing one-half their country’s
foodstuffs as against one-third
before the war.
While co-operation of a really
practical kind among the partici-
pating countries was found to be
still “pretty much of a dream,”
because “the obstacles are
great,” it is pointed out that this
must be a slow process, anyway,
and the “dream” has since been
advanced towards reality (and
the Western European Union
with it) in the meeting in
Brussels of Britain, France, Bel-
gium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg to draw up “a
military, economic, social and
cultural pact.”
Bad for Planners.
As “U.S. News-World Re-
port” sees it, the year isn’t going
so well for planners anywhere.
It lists some of them:
British see their planned ex-
port goals menaced by inflation,
unplanned.
French, Italians hope free
market will do what money
plans failed to do.
Germans, planning to double
exports, find customers can’t
pay in dollars.
Russians complain that pro-
duction costs are higher than
planned.
Swedes have had to revise
deal with Russia. First plan was
too ambitious.
Dutch find home plans
thrown off by unplanned trouble
in Indonesia.
Planners in South America,
North America and the Far
East report a similar crop of
troubles: Too much currency
chasing too few goods; produc-
tion costs rising, exports run-
ning into snags; careful plans
getting all fouled-up.
Commenting on the tendency
to blame all such troubles on the
U.S., the publication comments
that it is becoming clear that not
all the troubles stem from
Washington: “Planners in Lon-
don, Paris and elsewhere now
admit, if pressed, that maybe
they’ve bitten off more than they
can chew.”
Dragnet Digest.
H.C.W. —The high cost of living
is low-altitude stuff compared with
that of war. President Truman’s Air
Policy Commission stated in its re-
port: “Eighty per cent, of the U.S.
Budget for the fiscal year 1948 is in
payment for past wars and the main-
tenance of our present military estab-
lishment. Eighty-five per cent, of the
total U.S. Federal Budgets since 1915
have been for war or preparation or
payment for war.”

Hollywood Feels the Pinch. —U.S.
film companies are being hard hit,
according to Hollywood’s “czar,”
Eric A. Johnston, who told an inter-
viewer : “There is not a film company
of importance which has not been in
the red since the last quarter of 1947.”
And he added, “Matters will prob-
ably grow worse before they im-
prove.”
* * * *
Inflation Breeds Controls. —British
writer G. L. Schwartz, in a “Wall-
street Journal” article on current
Britain: “Inflationary pressure*plays
into the hands of a Left administra-
tion. It provides an excuse for im-
posing and perpetuating Government
controls, and the more you wriggle
under existing controls the more ex-
cuse is found for imposing further
controls.”
H*
Palestine Militia. —One of the
beautiful U.N.O. pipedreams in which
the Palestine partition was adopted
was that Arab and Jew militias would
keep the peace respectively in the two
States and hence in the Holy Land
altogether. Asked how the formation
of such militias would help, Palestine
Commission chairman Liscicky has
stated that they were needed to pre-
serve internal security, but he added
that they would require to be supple-
mented by an international force to
secure frontiers and “keep the militias
apart”!
* * * *
Votes for Wallace. —A bit of fuss
was made of the success of one Leo
Isacson in a Bronx election, Henry
Wallace having claimed that candidate
as his own. It might be a poor guide.
The Bronx district where Isacson won
has about 50 per cent. Jewish voters
and 20 per cent, “cullud.” A N.Y-
“World-Telegram” comment was that
“it seemed made to order f° r t “ e
Wallace type of campaigning,” which,
as well as its Pink tinge, consisted
largely of lambasting the Truman
Administration for being “lukewarm
on Palestine partition.”
* * * *
Concentration Camps Still. Ger-
mans aren’t through with concen-
tration-camp existence; a long
way. Commenting that “it is in-
comprehensible why newspapers that
are not under the Eastern -censorship
ignore such facts, a writer in the
Berlin organ of the Social Democratic
party asserts: “In the [Soviet] Hasten
Zone there is every effort to deny
the existence of concentration camps,
although every child knows that
Buchenwald in Thuringia and Mueti-
berg and Bautzen in Saxony are con-
centration camps.” The writer charg
that “of 16,000 prisoners at Muehl-
berg 6000 died in 18 months and were
buried by other inmates.”

Communists have a perverted talent —
the only kind of talent they possess —
for bringing on themselves with an
accumulation of force greater than their
own the feelings they exploit and the

sistance they have aroused. Even their
Soviet imperialism, that coarse and greedy
and faithless extension of the imperialism
of the Czars, contains within itself the
seeds of its destruction.
Their favorite device the double-cross
has itself served them ill. It is now fairly
clear that if Stalin had been honest in
1939 and a real Little Father to his people
there would have been no war that year.
Hitler himself had been influenced in
1938, very much against his will, by the
popular welcome given to Neville Cham-
berlain on his visits to Germany. Even
with Czechoslovakia in his possession, as
a result of his own recourse to the double-
cross, he might not have been able to
carry them into a war on two fronts,
always feared and, in this instance,
opposed by Field-Marshal Von Blomberg,
the Minister of War, and General Von
Fritsch, the Army C.-in-C. But after
going through the farce of inviting a
Franco-British military mission to con-
sultations in Moscow Stalin betrayed his
natural allies betrayed them and
humanity for a share of the anticipated
loot, and in the expectation that the
combatants would exhaust themselves in
a long war, after which his armies would
march to the domination of Europe over
its ruins.
Except as to the 100t —and that had to
be dropped—all the calculations of the
“clever” man with the bushy moustache
were upset. He saw unmoved the fall of
Norway, the Low Countries and France- -
that France which his fifth-column had
corrupted all too thoroughly, and to his
own confusion in time to come. After
the first shock of invasion an undivided
France might have carried on a defen-
sive campaign in Brittany, and could at
least have joined forces with the British
in North Africa, in either case saving
many Russians from the slaughter.
That slaughter, when it came, with
Hitler turning on his “clever” pal, was
terrible, Russia’s dead alone exceeded
7,000,000 —more than the losses, in killed,
wounded and missing, of all its allies —
and its fairest cities and provinces were
devastated. For nearly two years, in con-
' sequence of Stalin’s “cleverness,” Russia
had to encounter Hitler’s armies and air
squadrons unaided on the Continent, ex-
cept for R.A.F. bombing raids which
could not possibly be decisive; and
by force of circumstances it saved heaps
of British (and American) lives, and
spared Britain the horrors which would
have attended a full concentration of the
Luftwaffe. A thought which must have
given Stalin and his entourage, incapable
of self-reproach though they are, many
bitter hours. It still envenoms their
foreign “policy.”
Their foreign “policy,” as it concerns
the United States and the British Com-
monwealth, is sullen, perfidious and,
above all, stupid. At the end of the war
people in all these countries, touched
with pity for the Russians, and egged on
by a press which still had romantic
notions about Reds —the men wonderful,
the women ravishingly beautiful —were in
the mood to be exceptionally generous to
them. In the way of loans and gifts the
men in the Kremlin could have had every-
thing they fairly asked for. They did
accept U.N.R.R.A. assistance for White
v Russia and the Ukraine —they had to,
the inhabitants of those republics being
in dreadful straits —but, consumed with
hatred of the English-speaking demo-
cracies, they denied their subjects help
which those unfortunates sorely needed,
and which would have been given without
stint.
Pity for the people has turned to loath-
ing for the leaders who sourly rejected
it. By their unbroken succession of
subsequent follies —their veto-sabotage
of U.N.O, and all meetings of Foreign
Ministers, their vicious attacks on the
leaders of British and American Govern-
ments, their refusal to enter into peace
treaties, their maintenance of fifth-
columns, their repudiation of the pledges
they gave at Yalta and Potsdam and their
ephemeral conquests, brought about by
fraud, force and murder, of Poland,
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Rumania and
Czechoslovakia these leaders have
baited friendly nations into an in-
vincible determination to have no-
thing more to do with them and
to kt them do nothing more. Effects
of the changed attitude show up
in the certain passage of the Marshall
plan, to which Congressmen previously
doubtful have now given their adhesion,
and the impending economic union and
military alliance of Britain, France,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxem-
bourg, to which the Scandinavian coun-
tries and Italy may become parties.
In all English-speaking communities
with Governments which recognise the
Communist conspiracy for the foul thing
it is and are not afraid of it, as are the
wretched Administrations “led” by Mr.
Chifley and Mr. McGirr, Communists
are on the way out.
. The Americans have refused them
union office and are deporting foreign-
born Communists at a brisk rate. Canada,
requited for its gre.at gifts to Russia with
espionage and corruption, which reached
the House of Commons itself, is refusing
alien Communists entrance permits and
is considering the ejection of those pos-
sessing them. The N.Z. Labor Govern-
ment has set the law in motion against
Communists and fellow-travellers who
reduced its building programme to a
farce, and has enforced drastic regula-
tions against another lot. The president
of the Westralian Arbitration Court has
ruled that a Communist dismissed from
union office (vice-president of the Amal-
gamated Railway Employees) was law-
fully dismissed, since “he subscribes to the
gaining of industrial ends by violent and
illegal methods,” and “the result of violent
and illegal methods would be the destruc-
tion of the union itself.”
And another blo.w has been struck in
Queensland. Finding that “violent
methods,” not then illegal—such as in-
timidating workers and women in and
about their homes —were being employed
to prolong the wicked and hopeless
blockade, Mr. Hanlon caused them
to be made illegal, and with them picket-
ing or persuasion or coercion of men
obeying or disposed to obey an Industrial
Court order for their return to work —
all this in the most sweeping industrial
measure ever passed in an Australian
Parliament. It provides for police arrests
without warrant and for entry into and
removal of suspected pickets from homes,
“whether there by invitation or not.”
“You may call this the Paterson Bill,”
the Premier said. “He, Paterson” (a
Communist lawyer and minority M.L.A.
for Bowen), “inspired ways of getting
round the law by walking up and down
the road” with bands of pickets, “so it
has been necessary to strengthen the law.”
One more case of a Communist being too
clever by half.
It remained for the Liberals at Can-
berra to realise at length that you can’t
deal with snakes by scolding or stroking
them. Very tardily they came to the
conclusion, though it took “the gravity of
the international situation and the vital
importance of Australian production and
transport” to prepare them for the change
of mind and heart, that “Australian Com-
munism is treasonable, anti-democratic
and destructive,” and “decided to sup-
port a complete ban.” This brings them
into line with the Country party, and
they and their associates should be on
the Treasury benches in 18 or 19 months,
if not before. That should mean, among
other things, such as the clear embodi-
ment in Commonwealth industrial law
of the principle laid down by the Wes-
tralian Judge, that if the Healys, Thorn-
tons and Elliotts, whether in or out of
union office, continue to wage war on a
country which has been too kind to them,
and which they have repaid with evil, they
should be held for prosecution and, on
conviction, for imprisonment and deporta-
tion under the Crimes Act.
Mr. Chifley's "Honeymoon.”
No Australian who has observed the
behavior of Mr. Chifley during recent
weeks should require to have explained
to him how it was that Socialist parties
in certain European countries have, one
after the other, passed under the Com-
munist yoke.
In an attempt to rally majority opinion
to a “centre-group” Government and at
the same time the support of those
militants of the Left whose war-time
“underground” resistance was supposed
to have invested them with patriotic
ideals, the Socialist leaders permitted the
Communists to dictate the terms of poli-
tical alliance sometimes through
stupidity, sometimes through fear or
blackmail. That every repeated example
of this surrender ended in the Socialists’
own extinction conveyed no adequate
warning to the next victim-State on
Moscow’s list. The “moderates” yielded
to the same pressure and awaited, like
hypnotised rabbits, the same fate.
What the Czech Socialist leader Fier-
linger did in betraying the Czech demo-
cracy to the Communists, so Canberra
“Labor” is doing in Australia, The pro-
cess has been less spectacular; in our
land Moscow’s agents may so far have
been less in a hurry. But the economic
blockade of Queensland is evidence un-
mistakable of the evil they plan here.
Mr. Chifley’s failure in national leader-
ship is now undisguised and irredeem-
able. He is incapable of leading the
Commonwealth into the promised post-
war recovery because —
He will take no action against Com-
munist sabotage.
He has no scheme for overcoming the
stagnation of industry and the corruption of
services under everlasting strikes fomented
in sheer treason by Communist union
bosses.
He has killed the “Labor” party’s pros-
pects of popular confidence in any election
pledges by cynically legislating for sociali-
sation of industry without any mandate,
making excuse that the electors had im-
plied notice from an unauthorised party-
platform of what he might do when he
was returned to office.
His Bank Grab Act and his coming refer-
endum appeal, seeking permanent central
control of all prices, have been received
with spontaneous enthusiasm by the Com-
munist party only.
The proof of Mr. Chifley’s failure
is in full view of everybody. For
over a month the potentially richest
State of the Commonwealth has
been blockaded on sea and land by mili-
tant unions bossed by Communists and
directed by a Communist operational
staff collected from all over Australia.
Blockade is an act of war, and it was
instituted by these wreckers not for ven-
tilation of any union grievances but ex-
pressly as an application of “sanctions,”
designed to coerce a State Administration
—and a “Labor” Administration at that —
into obeying the orders of a self-
appointed junta in the same way as any
trade-union is expected to obey it. Said.
Queensland Premier Hanlon:
What do these mimicking Molotovs
think we are? Are we to be pushed around
like a lot of slaves?
“Yes,” yelled the Communists. And
“Yes” assented Mr. Chifley by every in-
ference to be drawn from the words in
which he has met reiterated Opposition
challenges in Parliament. Notable among
his responses under this head were his
refusal to reimpose the ban on the Com-
munist party for what he called its
“political philosophy” ; his refusal to in-
voke the Crimes Act against it, on
the ground that such a suggestion was
“political propaganda” ; and, finally, his
considered opinion, on the events of
many months in Europe, that towards
U.N.O. “the Soviet is not being co-
operative.” So Nero fiddled while Rome
burned. So some leader of an army
in the field, instead of marching towards
the sound of the guns in a crisis, might
remain aloof, piletending not to hear
them.
The military judgment on such a com-
mander must be the political judgment
on this “Labor” leader at Canberra. The
penalty should be political death, and the
sentence should be promulgated at the
referendum-voting in two months’ time.
It has been customary for “Labor” to
complain, upon defeat at the polls, that
the , Communists cruelled the party’s
pitch. This “Labor” “leader” has cruelled
it himself. His hope is that.“the electors
have short memories,” The desired
amnesia is, it appears, to be assisted by
the arrangement for the Royal visit to
the Commonwealth next February.
Mr. Chifley has not had to meet the
real test of his craven inaction during the
Queensland blockade. That is to say, he
was not, as it happened, faced with a
victory of the blockaders and the anarchy
which would have followed the downfall
of the Hanlon Government. But it will
be useful for the electors of Australia to
pause and ask themselves: What, in that
event, would Mr. Chifley have done that
he would not do last week ? Does he
draw the line anywhere against Com-
munist sabotage of Australian industry?
By every last tittle of evidence to date he
does not. Even though they “crucify the
workers,” as they have in outback
Queensland, he will not take the offensive
against these wreckers. By what moral
right,, then, is he permitted to remain at
the head of a Government of free Aus-
tralia?
Mr. Chifley’s latest solecism was
delivered before the Macquarie A.L.P.
assembly. He likened the present indus-
trial disorganisation to a “honeymoon.”
It “has been a very pleasant honey-
moon,” he said, “but, like all honey-
moons, will come to an end sometime.”
In Mr. Chifley’s fancy, as his next words
conveyed, the marriage of his Govern-
ment to socialisation opened with a honey-
moon of “petty industrial stoppages,”
doing “injury to fellow-citizens,” and ex-
posing Australia to “a possible depres-
sion.” The “honeymoon must come to
an end sometime,” but it could (he said)
give place tQ “a Golden Age,” for “Aus-
tralia never had better prospects of enter-
ing a Golden Age than today.”
If his past few years’ flirtation with the
Communists is what Mr. Chifley calls a
“honeymoon,” what will his “Golden
Age” be like, especially now that he has
conceded that Communists have a per-
fect right to continue demonstrating their
“political philosophy?” The answer,
plain enough to all those whose thinking
is not corrupted by such bunkum, is that
his words have ceased to mean anything
even to the Prime Minister himself-
Mr. Chifley has allowed the Com-
munists to lay waste Australia’s economy
to such an extent that the only hope he
can see is to socialise the trading banks
—that also with the Communists’ hearty
applause—and then, if his referendum
succeeds, impose bureaucratic control
over all industry and trading exchange,
even retail-trading in the smallest out-
back store, under permanent prices-regu-
lation from Canberra. He proclaims
with a pontifical air that affronts every
man who has risked money of his own in
business enterprise that only by these
means can a depression be averted and
increased national production be brought
about. Let him be answered in the first
place by the report of the governor of
his own Commonwealth Bank:
The problem is not only, or even mainly,
one of greater aggregate production [and
we have not even got that] but also of
greater production per man-hour.... In
present circumstances more production at
stable prices cannot be achieved without
careful co-ordination between the invest-
ment plans of private enterprise and public
authorities... .To be successful it demands
the informed co-operation of private enter-
prise—
not its extinction under the bludgeon of
universal “socialisation.” But since in
the future, as portrayed by Mr. Chifley,
the governor of the monopolist Com-
monwealth Bank will have to submit to
Treasury direction alike with every store-
keeper selling ice-cream to a schoolboy,
what the mass of electors is waiting to
hear is the Liberal-Country party leaders
saying with one voice, in the concise
language that Lord Woolton used in
Britain a few days ago:
The first thing we [the Conservatives]
will do on attaining office will be to try
to bring together all the people to work for
the country, to restore competition instead
of controls, and so bring down domestic
prices. There will be a 25 p.c. drop in
the cost of houses the moment free enter-
prise is established and builders are allowed
to build.
There is no hope of that under Mr.
Chifley’s “Golden Age,” to be developed
by Socialist central control from the
Communist “honeymoon.” There is no
hope of anything but wider wreckage of
industry through more Communist-run
blockades of this or that State, or of all
the States, a procedure which has been
announced by Communist Brown of the
Railway Union against Victoria, South
Australia and West Australia “if they
oppose the Banking Act.”
The Chifley Government must go. It
spells nothing but disaster for the Com-
monwealth, and to that its leader either
is blind or -does not care. The Com-
munists have got him by the short hairs.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Royal Gratitude Barred.
With his statement on the King’s decision
to visit Australia next year with the
Queen and Princess Margaret, Mr. Chifley
gave out the names of the Cabinet com-
mittee to supervise arrangements. There
was not one ex-serviceman among them.
While a matter for regret, that of course
will cause no surprise.
The Prime Minister included some
words which seemed to grace the form-
ality of the announcement when he added
that he had asked the Governor-General
to “express our gratitude to His Majesty,”
and declared for his own part that “all
will look forward eagerly to the oppor-
tunity of showing the feelings of pride
and affection we have for the Royal
Family.” Then came the jar.
Two days later a semi-official state-
ment from Canberra in the Melbourne
press ran:
There will be no recognition of official
services by Australian Federal Ministers or
officials associated with the organisation of
the tour by the bestowal of titles .
Which means that at least some influential
Australians, having access to Ministers,
hastened to register other feelings than
those of “gratitude, pride and affection,”
and stipulated that any such sentiments
expressed' by Chifley as in the name of
all our people must be conditioned by
the fact that “Labor” is allergic to marks
of Royal favor such as in this event might
be expected. The idea is that the King
will visit Australia —the first reigning
King who ever has done so—and will
have conveyed to him by advice of his
Australian Ministers that he shall not be
permitted to honor any of his Australian
subjects for personal service done for
him during this visit.
The churlishness of this afterthought in
Canberra is matched only by its insolence.


But His Majesty is not quite helpless even
under such advice. After all, the Royal
Victorian Order, for instance, is an order
1, of chivalry the bestowal of which is at the
Sovereign’s own personal discretion, inde-
pendent of any political advice, and was
instituted by Queen Victoria to be con-
ferred for personal services rendered to
her and her successors. Its numbers are,
for that reason, unlimited.
If the King wants to bestow any rank
of this Order upon any Australian who
does him personal service, he can do it
whatever Chifley and Co. may “advise.”
And if the present crowd in office at Can-
berra should, by any chance, be out by
February next year, and so denied
any influence over what Australia does
either, then none will be so mortified
as they.
Shadow Over Europe.
The period from now until the Italian
elections in the middle of April will be
the most ominous the post-war world has
known. There has been little doubt about
what has been happening since the
Potsdam agreement, when the seeds of
another war were sown. The truth is now
so obvious that even politicians and news-
paper editors who could see nothing but
good and friendliness in Soviet Russia are
awake to the danger. Mr. Herbert Mor-
rison, British Lord President of the
Council, said over .the week-end that “we
find ourselves back in the same sort of
nightmare of aggression we thought we
had banished by disposing of Hitler.” Sir
Hartley Shawcross, one of the prose-
cutors of Nuremburg, described as “vio-
lently pro-Russian three years ago,” like
a lot of others who have now made a
complete volte-face, says that European
nations must realise that they can sit
on a rail no longer; if they do, “one
by one they will fall off the fence into the
pit that totalitarians are preparing for
democracy.”
There is no question that Moscow,
which Stalin himself has described again
and again as the “base of world revolu-
tion,” has been organising chaos in a
number of European countries, as well as
in those British countries, including Aus-
tralia, which are still foolish enough to
allow his agents to operate in them.
These operations look much like a pre-
lude to war on the West.
On the eve of the signing at Brussels
of a pact of union by the five agreeing
countries in western Europe—Britain,
France and the Benelux union—and of the
meeting in Paris of 14 of the 16 nations
which are to benefit by the United States’
European Recovery Bill which passed the
Senate on March 14, Mr. James Byrnes,
formerly U.S. Secretary of State, who
followed Mr. Churchill into the camp of
the prescient statesmen more than a year
ago, told an audience at Charleston Mili-
tary Academy that the United States
should warn Russia that military
action would follow if the U.S.S.R.
threatened the independence of Greece,
Turkey, France or Italy. He omitted
Austria which suggests the possi-
bility that he knows a warning has
already been issued in that direction. The
Government of every little country with-
in reach of Russia is in a state of acute
alarm. Italy is in panic.
Whether the Hitlers of the Kremlin
will listen to a warning remains to be
seen. Dictators are usually stone-deaf
on the eve of aggressive operations—
almost as deaf, it would seem, as our
silent Dr. Evatt, who has posed so long
as a world figure but who, while one
of the greatest crises of modern Europe
has been developing, has been content to
leave the Commonwealth without a
Minister for External Affairs and Par-
liament without a Minister who can be
held accountable in the House for
foreign relations while he carries on
an unnecessary domestic squabble in the
High Court.
Canberra's Worst Show.
Waste of three weeks, and worse:
As barren as the way from Beersheba to Dan
was the part of the Canberra session that
dates from Feb. 18 to March 11, with the
House empty most of the time in between.
There were no sittings of the Senate nor, with
/the international situation growing worse
g al l the time and culminating in a violent death,
. possibly as trig with fate as the violent death
. of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire in
the summer of 1914, was Dr. Evatt present on
any occasion. True, he was “represented” by
“a report on international affairs,” tabled (as
usual!) too late for debate, though not too
late for private mockery of his claim that
U.N.O. adoption of his committee’s Palestine-
, partition recommendation was “an effective
; U.N.O. decision.”
Dr. Evatt was chairman of the Committee
;Ot Privilege appointed to go into the infamous
■ Mulcahy charge against the military honor of
the one member who has fought in two World
Wars and been a casualty in both—Adair
Macalister Blain. So he did not present that
report, and, discussion being refused, there
was a disgraceful denial of justice to Mr.
Blain.
Another Minister absent much of the time
was Mr. Ward. He was engaged in the special
Federal Court at Sydney, giving evidence in
the case in which his former fellow-member and
liaison officer” Garden is charged, along with
Harcourt Garden, Farrell and Parer, with con-
spiracy to defraud the Queensland timber con-
-9® rn Hancock and Gore. Also a witness was the
Ward protegd “Bill” Urquhart, who, with the
blessing of his patron, rose from the relatively
humble position of railway clerk, via a job in
.Laboi and National Service when Mr. Ward
was in control, to a £2OOO-a-year position in . a
typewriter enterprise, landing an import license
on the way.
, tJ A new witness was Royden Murray Service,
former manager of the Army Inventions
Directorate, whose evidence was highly in-
teresting. He admitted (1) having been intro-
duced to Garden by Farrell, who told him
Garden was “looking after timber interests”;
(2) having, as a J.P., witnessed an application
by Parer for, he was informed, “a lease in
New Guinea”; and (3) having received £2OO
trom Farrell by cheque payable to bearer.
Nor were these witness’s only admissions.
Under pressure from Crown counsel, who re-
minded him of a statement on a material point,
made in chambers before the hearing, he ad-
mitted the truth of the words “Farrell said
he had seen the Minister and was directed to
pass all communications through Garden,” and
the falsity of his deposition that Farrell had
never told witness that he had seen the
Minister. He pleaded that he had “rectified
immediately” what, as Mr. Shand put it to
him, was “a deliberate lie,” and gave as his
motive for swearing what was “not the truth”
reluctance “to give evidence that would be
embarrassing or injurious to the Minister
I did not wish to make a statement contrary
to the Minister’s statement that he had not met
the gentleman.”
Rejecting argument by counsel for the
defence that there was no case to go to a
jury, Mr. Collins, S.M., committed all four
accused for trial. Mr. Cassidy had argued,
for Farrell, that Garden was Ward’s “instru-
ment” in the affair. Mr. Simon Isaacs (for
Garden) had contended that the case depended
solely on Ward’s veracity, and Ward had been
“contradicted and given the lie direct by un-
impeachable witnesses.” Indeed Ward was
“an unmitigated liar, quite unworthy of the
slightest credence in any Court whatever;
nobody would dream of hanging a dog on
anything he said.”
A report of these remarks reached Canberra
before the House had concluded its business.
Uttered and published in Victoria, South Aus-
tralia, Westralia, Britain or any other country
where the old traditions and decencies are pre-
served, they would have led immediately to the
Minister’s voluntarily leaving or being suspended
from office, not to return to it until he had
completely vindicated himself. But five days
after the report appeared Mr. Ward was still
Minister of External Territories (Transport also),
and there was then every indication that he will
still be Minister when his credibility and honor
are challenged at the trial.
This country has fallen into the hands of
people with very peculiar notions of Minis-
terial and Cabinet responsibility, along with
their other peculiar notions.
A Twice-fulfilled Prophecy.
In 1922 Sir lan Hamilton delivered a
series of lectures to the British Legion,
and in the following year he published
them in a book, The Friends of England.
Surviving the Second World War, which
he predicted and dreaded, the old warrior
saw other fears borne out and other
predictions come to pass. And much of
what he wrote is as pertinent to post-
Potsdam Europe as it was to the “Balk-
anised Europe” brought about by “the
wreckers who let down humanity at Ver-
sailles” —his own words. For example:
Yugoslavia: the most composite fluid
State on earth. How can those peasant
Serbs hold, control, assimilate or carry on
with Dalmatia, Croatia, Slovenia, Mace-
donia, Bosnia and Herzegovina on their
backs?
Bulgar and Slav may hate one another,
but that is nothing to the mutual hate
against the Greeks the only Balkan State
which cares two pins about us.
To me, Poland assumes the aspect of
a number of exceptionally gifted and
charming personalities who coalesce
into something impossible, ill-starred and
fatal—fatal to themselves and to their
neighbors.
Czechoslovakia is like some laborious silk-
worm into whose body an ichneumon fly
has inserted its deadly egg.
Benes is proclaimed in newspapers as a
wonder. I wonder?
There followed a marvellous passage to
which events have given a double signi-
ficance ;
When Masaryk goes west Benes won’t
last long—nor Czechoslovakia either.
Masaryk died on September 17, 1937.
Thirteen months later Benes was a fugi-
tive, In 1935 he had brought off a
Russian alliance which was built on sand.
His republic had no alliance with Britain,
and the Chamberlain Government re-
fused to take an unready and unwilling
Empire into war on its account, either in
that year or in 1939, when Hitler ex-
tinguished it in breach of his pledged
word. And here may be quoted a note
on the Munich period made by the editor
of the London “Times”;
No one who sat in this place, as I did
in the autumn of 1938, with almost daily
visitations from eminent Canadians and
Australians, could fail to realise that war
with Germany at that time would have
been misunderstood and resented from end
to end of the Empire.
Nevertheless, many newspapermen were
for war at the time even in Australia,
with its few thousand militiamen, ill-
trained and ill-armed, and its ageing
cruisers and its Wirraways; and they
never ceased to revile Chamberlain.
They still pose as oracles, though now
as scared of Russia and its fifth-columns
as they were sentimental about them for
years and years.
Now the second Masaryk has gone
west, and Benes will follow him, though
not perhaps by the same route.
In July, 1945, Benes handed over Sub-
carpathian Ruthenia to Russia—it was
one of the four original provinces of
Czechoslovakia —as part of the price of
“liberation.” In March, 1948, he basely
surrendered what was left, remaining in
office as “president” of a Communist
police-State. What a creature and what
a country to have gone to war for when
war would have been madness!
The younger Masaryk was worthy of a
better country and a better leader. It
matters little whether he was murdered or
destroyed by his own hand. Most assuredly
his Czechoslovakia was murdered by
Stalin, who swore in a dozen instruments
—treaty of alliance, Atlantic Charter,
Teheran and Yalta agreements and the rest
—to respect its liberties and independence.
Dawning Recognition.
The average motor-owner, whether he
owns a small runabout or a fleet of
trucks, is so used to being shot at by
Governments that he must seriously sus-
pect them of a tacit conspiracy to drive
him off the road. State Premiers have
frankly revealed that at least one form
of motor taxation —the 3d.-per-mile per
ton or passenger charged on commercial
vehicles —is imposed for the sole pur-
pose of bolstering-up railway revenue.
When that tax was added to commercial
aeroplanes Mr. O’Sullivan, the N.S.W.
Transport Minister, actually said that if
people preferred to travel by what he
chose to call luxury means then they
could expect to pay for the railway losses.
Some idea of what would occur if
motors were driven from the roads can
be gained from figures:
Annual revenue got from motorists by

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
restricted conditions. Once petrol-ration-
ing and new-car priorities disappear there
will be a big increase. No wonder that
the Chamber of Automotive Industries,
contemplating the figures, seriously
suggests that
There is no need to fear the loss of
capital invested in railways through freeing
road transport from its shackles, because
after the construction of roads by State
Roads Boards (which is what motor taxes
are supposed to be for) there is a surplus
of revenue from motor taxation which, if
used for railway amortisation, would pay
off the capital cost of all State railways
within 20 years, even if the revenue from
motor taxation did not increase.
Of course, nobody believes that State
Governments would willingly close rail-
ways even if the motor industry volun-
teered to bear all the financial loss in-
volved. No ; the railways must be kept
going to provide jobs for the thousands
it takes to run them so slowly, blunder-
ingly and extravagantly.
But things aren’t what they were. In
Victoria, N.S.W. and Queensland the
Premiers have discovered that their rail-
ways are the targets of the industrial
anarchists, and, when they’re stopped by
strikes, the overtaxed, hampered and
harried motor-dransport operators have
to be brought in to keep the flow of
goods moving. What’s more, the motor-
men have had a little of their own back
in the temporary but significant lifting
of the road load-taxes while railway
strikes are on.
If an occasional motorist is seen sitting
in his car or truck sniggering secretly
these days it is merely a sort of mild
hysteria induced by signs that at
last he is being recognised as something
more than fair game for taxgatherers.
POLITICAL POINTS
At the beginning of its seventh week
the Queensland Government railway
strike was obviously petering out. Hun-
dreds of trains were running, and Com-
munists had been reduced to desperation,
as was shown when their Healy (alias Mc-
Cracken) and Englart led such of the mob
as remained into a larrikin defiance of
the anti-picketing law. And little or no
help came from N. S. Wales, though the
A.R.U., without a word of protest from
the quivering McGirr or the pliant
Hartigan, had banned rail carriage of
goods to Queensland.
Cost of the Queensland strike to Mon-
day, as worked out by “S. M. Herald”:
Wages lost, £BOO,OOO.
Rail-revenue loss, £1,500,000.
Cargo in idle ships, £2,500,000.
Wool held up, value £3,000,000.
This was only part of it. Strikers’ families
were out of cash and credit, building was
at a standstill, the outback was still short
of supplies, wool sales were “off” in
N. S. Wales and Victoria, and no food
for Britain had been shipped from
Queensland for a fortnight. What a
price Australia pays for its Moscow fifth-
column! And what a price it will con-
tinue to pay until the rule of law is en-
forced from Wilson’s Promontory to
Cape York, and from the Leeuwin to
the Line.
Claude Matthews, who was going to do
wonderful things as N.S.W. Minister of
Building Materials when appointed four
months ago, has broken or fallen down
and been complimented into a sinecure.
Tourist Activities and Immigration.
Finnan goes from the sinecure to Labor
and Industry, which was added to the
Baddeley collection when Hamilton
Knight became one of the Chifley-Evatt
Conciliation Commissioners. Dickson,
M. is to be Building Materials.
That will mean 16 Ministers when Dick-
son’s successor is chosen from the Second
Chamber men ; and there may be other
changes. Ontario, bigger in area than
N. S. Wales, and with a million more
people, has 13 Ministers, two honoraries
and 90 members—there are 150 in N.S.W.
This time a hundred years ago Zachary
Taylor, at 64, was being recommended to
Americans as Whig candidate for Presi-
dency on the score of services rendered
as general in a Pacific war. With the sub-
stitution of “Republican” for “Whig”—
there was no Republican party in 1848 —
the same is now true of Douglas Mac-
Arthur, and Australians will wish their
old C.-in-C. all the luck in the world. But
it is no use denying that his age—6 B—is
against him, especially as his people have
learned from the Roosevelt experience
that an old and failing President can
land them and friends in heaps of trouble.
A Gallup poll taken by the energetic
young man who attends to these matters,
and who has been complimented by
“Labor” politicians on his accuracy, must
have come as a dreadful shock to Ded-
man. The question, put in all States, was
whether tenants of Government-built
houses should be given the right of pur-
chase, and 94 per cent, said yes. So
94 in the hundred, in brutal disregard of
Deddy’s conveections, want, and want
others, to be “little capeetalists.” Wad
ye ever hae thocht it, Doctor-r Coombs?
N.S.W. “Labor” politicians have never
forgiven the University Senate for trying
to prevent their logrolling the 1942
Zionist immigrant Stone into a
law professorship, then and for years
after superfluous. Now their Mr.
C. Evatt has blamed the Senate
for almost everything except the beer
shortage and the mouth-clogging quality
of the stuff Sydney bakers are pleased
to call bread, “Culture here,” he said
(“here” being the University), “is as dead
as the dodo. Original thought is virtu-
ally non-existent,” What a non-stop
fountain of “original thought” N.S.W.
“Labor” is! What marvellous contri-
butions to culture—manners, too—are
the lotteries and tin-hare gambling it
introduced during the depression and the
“turf club” it set up during the Japanese
war, with night trots and a Judge-headed
“racing appeals tribunal” to follow!
The Rural Reconstruction Commis-
sion, in its tenth report, is all for a
“national council of farmers,” a sort of
one big union with (of course!) “repre-
sentatives of the appropriate Federal
departments”:
Expert public servants dealing with
national marketing, economic and financial
problems of agriculture and with inter-
national relationships representatives of
local governing bodies and of Governments;
of consumers, farm employees, manufac-
turing and marketing branches of the
industries.
When farmers can send “representatives”
to trade-unions they may give some
thought to their one big union, as pro-
posed.
The Rural Reconstruction Commission
is a Dedman show. On the subject of
land tenure it has come to a most un-
Dedmanlike conclusion:
Private ownership, subject to controls, is
the most satisfactory basis of holding agri-
cultural land.
However, there was balm in Gilead for
Deddy—that blessed word “controls.”
Using petrol got with the sanction of
Ashley’s Supply Department, Queensland
road operators are bringing Queensland
produce to N. S. Wales, McGirr’s rail-
waymen having “banned” carriage by
rail. “S. M. Herald” had it that McGirr
might possibly make a statement in his
“Parliament” on reciprocal road traffic
from McGirr’s State; he made a sort-of-
a-kind-of statement in reply to Bruxuer
andTreatt:
I am not aware that though the Govern-
ment railways won’t carry food to Queens-
land they carry Communists 1 don’t
know whether or not the Queensland strike
is a fight between Communists and consti-
tuted Government.
The Sydney R.A.S. people have ex-
cluded “fat women and other human
freaks, as well as animals in captivity”
from their sideshows. How about in-
viting McGirr to exhibit himself as a
human curiosity, a Mac who won’t light?
As the brief pre-Easter session of the
House was closing the Liberals carried
a party resolution pledging them to ban
the Commo “party.” According to lobby
talk some of the Libs, have been galled by
comments that Lang is rapidly qualifying
as leader of the Opposition. In attacks
of the sort that raise itching small lumps
on Minister’s hides, he has certainly been
doing a duty proper to the front Oppo-
sition bench.
The Rationing Commission is costing
about half a million a year, so it ought
to know its onions. It recommended
abolition of clothes rationing. Chifiey
wouldn’t have it: “the Government is
not confident that in the months ahead
there might not be some acute short-
ages” (Chifiey to Holt). This may be
interpreted to mean that Chifiey has no
confidence in the Rationing Commission.
If so, he should get rid of it —but he
won’t.
Canberra announces that a small staff
of efficiency experts will be appointed this
year to ensure that the requirements of
the Commonwealth public service are
thoroughly understood and energetically
pursued. Next year a small staff of effi-
ciency experts will be appointed to ensure
that the requirements of the Common-
wealth public service are thoroughly-
understood and energetically pursued by
the small staff of experts appointed this
year.
Without a secret ballot what chance
has a decent unionist of going against
the mob? Brisbane wharfies at a mass
meeting decided that no relief-money
would be paid to any member unless he
took part in illegal picketing. So men
are not only intimidated into acquiescing
in a lawless strike, but are bludgeoned
into another form of lawbreaking,
A masterpiece of understatement
from Chifley: “The U.S.S.R. is not being
co-operative.” Perhaps he was influ-
enced by a dim memory of Dr. Evatt’s
report to him and the nation, after “hav-
ing, during the last four years, come to
know some of Russia’s greatest states-
men : the Soviet Union’s policy is directed
towards self-protection and security
against future attack.” From Andorra
and San .Marino, no doubt.
Earle Page, having finished his tour of
Africa —he traversed the whole of the
eastern part of the continent, from Kenya
to the Cape—is to be home on March 25,
and R. G. Casey about the end of the
month. It is to be hoped that each has
brought some life-giving herb or hormone
which will revivify his party.
Tasmania’s Second Chamber rejected
a Transport Bill purporting to “clarify
any doubts as to the Commission’s
powers to initiate road services and pur-
chase others by agreement.” Thereupon
it called for the tabling in the
Council of cashbooks relating to
“Labor’s” secret fund or weapon, Cos-
grove’s reply was that “the Government
has no intention of tabling any private
papers belonging to myself and party.”
On that note the “Government”
scrambles into an unearned recess.
By an unwritten law, hitherto binding
on Parliaments, the “Labor” Government
in Tasmania should ask the people,
through the Governor, to pronounce judg-
ment on its conduct of affairs and on the
case of its Premier, who was acquitted of
bribery and corruption charges by a
10-2 verdict, unacceptable in other
States, But in these matters “Labor” —
not only in Tasmania —makes its own
rules in the spirit of Rafferty, deceased.
Acknowledgments to a Brisbane man
for a reminder of a Chifley reference to
Czechoslovakia, introduced as a clincher
into the P.M.’s defence of the Bank Grab
Bill:
Chifley: I contest a statement made by
Mr. Menzies that the only two countries
which have nationalised their banks are
Argentina and Russia.
Abbott: I showed that France had.
Chifley (to Abbott): Have you ever heard
of Czechoslovakia?
We have ail heard of Czechoslovakia, and
the Chifleys are going to hear a great deal
more about it.
Innocents as they are, the Chifleys let
Czechoslovakia have a lot of wool on
tick. They now have the job before them
of getting paid for it in negotiable
currency or goods. And they promised
the Czechs tariff cuts —on “china, porce-
lain, etc.,” in Dedman’s euphemistic
lingo. “What guarantee is there,” asked
Fadden, “that the present ‘Government’
at Prague will not repudiate the agree-
ment or that the Soviet will not use the
tariff concessions for its own ulterior
purposes?” No guarantee whatever.
Communist pledges are like those of
drunks, and like dicers’ oaths and death-
bed repentances. Lying and cheating are
part of their “system.”
The title “police magistrate” is abol-
ished in a Victorian Crimes Act Amend-
ment Bill to be introduced next month.
It is to be “stipendiary magistrate.”
Other charges will be abolition of the
death-penalty, except in treason and
murder cases, and for all persons under
18 (treason trials, though Victoria has
never had one, have become a possi-
bility). Alteration of the law relating to
child-stealing, so that it will be an offence
to entice a child from its parents even
without force fraud, and another
change makes a wife a competent, but
not compellable, witness in cases in which
at present she cannot testify against her
husband.
Prayers for the ending of the Com-
munist blockade were offered up on Sun-
day in all the Queensland churches. A
facer for Communists who use the poison-
tipped dagger of sectarianism to gain and
retain control of unions and Labor
Councils.
One night last week the Rev. H. J.
Whitney left his manse to address a
public meeting at Bundaberg on the
strike and on the Communist threat to
Australia and Europe. The forthright
and eloquent Presbyterian minister re-
called his visit to Sydney in 1945:
Preaching in our oldest church, I found
the lights cut off. As a clergyman and
a citizen I protested against this inter-
ference with freedom of worship, and on
the following day it was announced that
lighting restrictions would be lifted in all
churches in Sydney. The Bulletin said
that I put the lights back into the churches
by that one address.
At Bundaberg, according to the “News-
mail,” 5000 people —many of them, of
course, unionists —cheered the Rev.
Whitney when he mounted the platform
and listened to him in silence broken
only by applause. Then they unani-
mously affirmed their unswerving alle-
giance to the Throne and Empire” ; their
“opposition to all totalitarian forms of
government and rule by repressive mino-
rities” ; their “complete support for the
Premier in his stand for law and order”
and their “clear conviction that drastic
action should be taken to check those
who persist in subverting the law.”
From the Great Molonglo Desert:
Suddenly and without premeditation the
session collapsed the most miserable three
weeks in a quarter of a century. Fadden wanted
to sit on, but other party men were anxious
to get into recess. The Liberals have leaned
back too complacently, harboring the belief
that Australia is yearning for the return
of the “Great Liberal Tradition.” None
of the problems which should have been
touched by them were even smelt at,
though they are many and urgent—the 40-hour
week, Ward’s position, foreign affairs and de-
fence, sterling, France and gold, Bretton Woods
and gold, the future of U.K. armament and its
impact on our affairs, Dr. Evatt’s Palestine
muddle, Parliament’s attitude to Japan and the
Pacific peace-treaty in the light of what is
happening in Manchuria. Free air-travel
at week-ends has helped to kill this
Parliament as a deliberative assembly.
Some members don’t even trouble to stay when
the House is sitting. They just fly up and down
occasionally to register an appearance.

...FIRST CHOICE
FOR A CENTURY
PERSONAL ITEMS
Sydney was invaded by scientists on
Sunday when the Qantas Constellation
plane disgorged four of the tribe, each a
topliner in his own particular branch.
Three of them hail from this part of the
world and are here to advise on the
establishment of the National Research
University at Canberra. They are atomic
research mail Marcus Oliphant, now Pro-
fessor of Physics at Birmingham, Sir
Howard Florey, one of the discoverers
of penicillin, and Raymond Firth, Pro-
fessor of Anthropology at the University
of London. Oliphant and Florey are
Adelaide-born; Firth a Maorilander. The
fourth parcel of knowledge is Sir Ben
Lockspeiser, chief scientist to the British
Ministry of Supply, who is visiting Can-
berra for the conference of the Aero-
nautical Research Council.
Jan Masaryk did not possess the intel-
lectual capacity of his father, the Founder
of Czechoslovakia, but that he had some
of the old man’s power to inspire faith
in his fellows is suggested by the words
and action of Karol Tokoly, Acting Czech
Consul-General in Sydney, who, on hear-
ing of his reported suicide, immediately
resigned his position and announced that
the only reason he had not done so when
the Communists seized power in Prague
was Masaryk’s retention of the post of
Foreign Minister. Masaryk had been in
the Czech Foreign Services since the birth
of the republic, most of the time as
Minister to Britain. He resigned
in 1938 in protest against the Munich
agreement, and when Hitler marched into
Czechoslovakia he was one of the group
who formed the Government-in-Exile.
For a while he was deputy-Prime Minister,
and on the return of Parliamentary Gov-
ernment to Prague became Foreign
Minister. The full story of his death may
not be known for some time, but whether
the force that sent him crashing to his
death in the courtyard of the Czernin
Palace was physical or mental, history’s
verdict will doubtless be one of murder.
Owing to the Royal visit Sir Winston
Dugan will probably remain Governor
of Victoria for another 12 months, though
he has intimated that he would step down
if Lord Mountbatten accepted the
position. He already holds the duration
record for the vice-regal office in Aus-
tralia—Governor of Victoria since 1939
and Governor of South Australia for
five years before that.
Operator of the loneliest amateur radio
station in the world must be Gresham
Major, radio-physicist now working the
world from his station VK7AE, Mac-
quarie Island. A member of the Aus-
tralian Antarctic Expedition, he is one of
five radio scientists who obtained licences
from the P.M.G. prior to their southern
sojourn. Three others 'are on Heard
Island and another aboard H.M.A.S.
Wyatt Earp. Communication will not be
too easy, as the Aurora Australis plays
havoc with the reflecting Heaviside layer
in the southern parts of the globe.
Not blessed with an overabundant
rainfall, one of South Australia’s ever-
present problems is how to make the most
of what does fall. One man who knows
more about the subject than most is
Julian Randall Dridan, Deputy-Engineer-
in-Chief. He gained his B.E. degree at
Adelaide ’Varsity in 1922, and next month
will have completed a quarter of a cen-
tury in the Government service, during
which time he has had experience in all
parts of the State. While in charge of
Northern District he superintended the
construction of a 50-mile section of the
Morgan-Whyalla pipeline, which carries
Murray water around the head of
Spencer’s Gulf to the iron-ore town.
After that he was given leave of absence
to report on a scheme for taking River
Darling water to Broken Hill; work on
that project is now under way. Last year
Dridan was appointed to the River Mur-
ray Commission. He’s 46.
At a Government House investiture in
Brisbane last week three policemen re-
ceived Royal Humane Society awards for
bravery. Constable F. J. Cleary was
given a silver medal for rescuing a man
from the flooded Bremer River. Sergeant
J. Nicholl, of Brisbane, and Constable
R. J. Layton, of Moorooka, received
bronze medals for an unusual piece of
work last Christmas Day, when a woman
and five children were marooned on an
island caused by the flooding of Sheep
Station Creek, near Brisbane. The two
officers swam out and. kept the family
supplied with food until they could be
rescued.
Dead at sea on the Llangibby Castle
on his way home from a health trip to
Kenya, Robert McGowan Barrington-
Ward, editor of the “Times.” He was
one of the five sons of a North of Ireland
parson, all of whom had distinguished
careers. After Westminster and Oxford
—he was president of the Union —he
joined the “Times” as one of the editor’s
secretaries, but the First World War
broke out within a year and he went to
France .with the Duke of Cornwall’s Light
Infantry. He was wounded in 1917;
other souvenirs of the war included a
D. 5.0., M.C. and three mentions. Back
in London he took up the Tancred
Scholarship he had won before the war
and was called to the Bar in 1919. J. L.
Garvin asked him to become assistant-
editor of the “Observer,” and he held
that post for eight years, by which time
Geoffrey Dawson, his old chief, brought
him back to the “Times” as assistant-
editor. In 1934 he became deputy-editor,
and he succeeded Dawson as editor in
1941. His colleagues knew him as a
man of broad and tolerant views, with a
great capacity for hard work and a high
sense of devotion to his paper.
Sir Hugh Cairns, of whom Lord Nuffield
said that “this great Australian” inspired
the benefactions he made to Oxford, was
one of the principal speakers at a unique
ceremony at the centenary of Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital. A child who was re-
cently cured of the once-lethal tubercular
meningitis by use of streptomycin manu-
factured at the Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories in Melbourne was intro-
duced to 250 doctors. Leona Moules,
the seven-year-pld girl in question, had
been given three days to live. After three k
months’ injections she recognised her
mother. She is now resuming her study
of ballet dancing. Sir Hugh Cairns is
her hero.
Superintendent J. F. Scott becomes
Commissioner of Police in N.S.W. in suc-
cession to W. J. Mac Kay. The appoint-
ment, in addition to putting Scott at the
top of the ladder, gives him an extra five
years in the force. As a super, he would
have passed in his badge in two years’
time at 60; as commissioner he will bat
on to 65. Born in Bathurst in 1890,
he spent his boyhood at Orange,
joined the police force in 1911, and after
a few years in the country was transferred
POLICE COMMISSIONER.
to headquarters, where he has spent most
of the years since, though he was for a
while licensing inspector and did a spell
of duty round some of the city stations.
He had been deputy-commissioner, for
the past five years.
The vicious-looking weapon placed by
Coventry in the right-hand of John L. S.
Bice, Government Whip in S.A.’s Legis-
lative Council, must be regarded as sym-
bolic Only ; Bice usually finds that a mild
tongue-lashing is sufficient to whip up
his team for a division. The pipe is

genuine ; its emptiness is the artist’s mute
protest against tobacco-rationing. Before
the First World War Bice was on the land,
but he came back from that scrap with a
leg wound which forced him to give up
active farming. When the Soldiers’ Settle-
ment Department was established he was
the first inspector appointed ; he rose to
superintendent. He has been a member
of the Council since 1941, but has a long
way to go before he overtakes his father’s
record—J.G. was a member of that House
for nearly 30 years and Chief Secretary in
several Governments.
There’s at least one man in Victoria
whose eyesight hasn’t been ruined by
modern civilisation. He is J. H. Williams,
of the Melbourne Rifle Club. At the
King’s Prize meeting at Williamstown
range he scored 27 out of a possible 35
in a strong cross-wind with three bulls’-
eyes in the first stage—and it was his
first shoot for 17 years. Now 80, he
started with a Martini rifle in 1887,
when he used to come down from Ben-
digo with the cadets to compete for the
Sargood Shield. During his 60 years of
shooting he has won over £5OOO.
Retiring from Ivanhoe Grammar
School (Vic.), which he founded in 1914,
Rev. Sydney Buckley steps down with the
knowledge that his years of hard work
have been worth while. He began the
venture with a dozen pupils and an over-
draft ; he hands over the school with a
magnificent property, nearly 500 pupils
and something in the kitty. New head is
38-year-old Westralian Rhodes Scholar
V. R. Brown, who left Perth Uni. for
Oxford with a B.Sc., and while there
added M.A. and Dip. Ed. The boys are
wondering what sort of use he can make
of his 6ft. 2in. and 14st.
Recently appointed Chief-of-Staff to
the naval branch of the British Joint
services mission in Washington, Rear-
Admiral B. B. Schofield, the R.N.
skipper who brought H.M.S. King
George V to Australia during the war.
On his return to the Old Country he sent
a bronze plaque of the ship’s insignia to
Melbourne’s Lud Mayor Connelly “in
appreciation of a genial host.”
Reported from London that Jascha
Spivakovsky, giving his first concert after
17 years’ absence in Australia, had his
audience stamping and cheering and the
critics searching for superlatives to de-
scribe his performance. When he and his
brother Tossy, the violinist, and Kurtz,
the ’cellist, made their first tour of Aus-
tralia in 1933 audiences went on in the
same way. Jascha and Kurtz married
Australians, and all three settled in Mel-
bourne with jobs at the Conservatorium.
After they had been here a few years
they gave a concert at the Town Hall,
and there were fewer than 500 people
present. There was no reason to suppose
that their playing was poorer than when
the public went mad about them ; in fact,
it was probably much better, so that the
only conclusion that can be come to is
that in giving the country the benefit of
their music they had lost prestige, and that
prestige is the only thing that most
“music-lovers” go on. Subsequently
Tossy went to U.S. and became world-
famous.
Thanks to a foundation established by
Dr. Leonhard Adam, Melbourne Uni-
versity will shortly have one of the finest
collections of aboriginal art in Australia.
Dr. Adam is a German anthropologist
who had already acquired international
standing in London when he came to
Australia. His book Primitive Art,
in the Penguin series, is a standard work.
He was responsible for the acquisition of
the Buddha head from Java in the
National Gallery, the only example in
Australia of Hindu-Buddhistic art from
the Burubudur temple. In private pos-
session, it was offered to the trustees, but
was *rejected as being of no importance.
Dr. Adam saw it several years later, in-
stantly recognised its value and offered
to testify to its importance. It was re-
submitted and bought—at twice the
original figure.
George C. Hannan, Liberal candidate
for Melbourne province in the Vic. Leg.
Council by-election, has close associations
with untold wealth, although he may not
own much of it. His grand-uncle, Patrick
Hannan, was discoverer, with Thomas
Flannagan, of Kalgoorlie, and saw
£100,000,000 extracted from that field in
his lifetime.
• Unlike that of most composers, the
rise of Dr. Hubert Clifford, 8.8. C. Music
Supervisor, who was recently reported to
be coming back to his native land to
adjudicate in musical competitions, has
been almost meteoric. Born at Briago-
long (Vic.), and educated at the Albert-
street Conservatorium —he was one of
Fritz Hart’s pupils—he conducted his
own compositions at the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne, while still in his ’teens, but went
to London as an unknown, his only
recommendation a letter to Sir Henry
Wood. Many popular composers cannot
orchestrate their works. They make a
skeleton of the theme and hand it to
others to do the orchestration, much as
if a painter drew a skeleton image of his
sitter and sent it to a paint-shop to have
the tone and color inserted. Expecting
his visitor to be a composer of this kidney
Sir Henry listened to Clifford rattle off
a piece of his own on the piano and
said: “That’s all right. Can you orches-
trate it?” “I’ve already done so,” said
the young man. “Can you conduct?”
“Yes.” “Right,” said the founder of the
Queen’s Hall Proms, “come along in a
week’s time and my orchestra will re-
hearse it for you.” In a few years Clif-
ford was conducting some of the most
famous orchestras in England.
Into the Silence:
In Brisbane, at 50, Syd Beck, well-known
vaudeville comedian who had played in most
of the Australian capitals. At one time he
was a champion swimmer and a member of
the Manly Surf Life Saving Club. At the
opening of Federal Parliament House in 1927
he was one of the entertainers chosen to per-
form before the Duke and Duchess of York.
In Adelaide, at 79, Francis James Irwin,
sharebroker, member of the Adelaide Stock
Exchange, and former captain of Royal Adelaide
Golf Club. Son of Canon H. O. Irwin, he
was Tasmanian-born, came to S.A. when he
was 13, and became a partner in the share-
broking firm of Irwin and Morey at the begin-
ning of the century.
In Adelaide, at 86, George Dodsworth
Basnett, former chairman of directors of Enter-
prise Shoe Company and Peacock and Com-
pany and a member of the Adelaide Bowling
Club.

“Ern”: I don’t know about Maori-
landers preferring their beer warm, but
on a recent visit to New Zealand I
strolled into a pub where a couple of
Maoris were drinking. The beer I was
handed was flat, and I said so. One of
the Maoris agreed. “It’s crook all right.
I’ll be glad when I’ve had enough! ”
“Jasby” on a Lost Week-end:
Through a union dispute in the breweries
most Sydney hotels were without beer on the
first Saturday in March. Regulars, after a
fruitless pilgrimage from pub to pub in search
of their favorite sozzle, either went home
thirsty or turned in desperation to spirits or
wine. Next day the “Sunday Sun” reported
“Despite a beer drought in city and suburban
hotels yesterday, police arrested 400 drunks.
This was a record number of arrests —more
than arrested on December 14 when beer was
plentiful.” The reporter went on to explain this
was due to the topers drinking cheap wine,
and listed suburban police-stations where record
numbers of drunks had been lumbered. On
Monday the “Daily Telegraph” had something
to say on the subject. Its line was: “The
majority of Sydney and suburban police-
stations had empty cells during the week-end.
Police said that the beer shortage had given
them a quiet week-end.” Followed a list of
stations which had reported no arrests —some
of them among those reported by the “Sun”
as having record hauls. I have no interest in
statistics as such; I don’t want to start an
argument on drunkenness and sobriety. Nor
am I interested in the relative drunk-making
merits of high-priced beer and cheap wine. As
to worrying about the accuracy of the daily
press—l gave that up long before Stalingrad.
But the drinking public has its rights, inalien-
able and indisputable, irrespective of whether
it gets drunk on beer, plonk or lollywater. If
the police have been pulling the legs of one
or other of those reporters it is up to them to
come right out into the open. What I and a
host of other Lost Week-enders are entitled to
know is; Where did we spend that Saturday
night?

“Bosun’s Mate”: The King’s visit next
year in battleship Vanguard will start a
frenzy of polishing among guards and
bands. Few people know that the King
today is the only person living, not actu-
ally a serving member, who is entitled to
the navy’s highest honor —piping the side.
Distinctly naval, the pipe is reserved for
naval officers in uniform and all officers
of a foreign navy boarding a British
warship. Captains of ships boarding an-
other—-whether four-ringed battleship
captain or sub-lieutenant skipper of an
air-sea rescue launch —are piped in-
board. Tedder or Montgomery would
be received with a mere guard and band.

“Cy Cyclone”; Caption beneath a Mel-
bourne “Age” illustration;
Royal family sees a thriller. Queen
Elizabeth, followed by the King and
Princess Margaret, leaving the Mercury
Theatre, Netting Hill Gate, London, after
seeing the play “Murder in the Cathedral.”
The error is excusable. Some years ago
a highly-placed English civil servant,
charged with the entertainment of a party
of visiting diplomats, took them to an
earlier production of the same “thriller,”
thinking a juicy whodunit would pro-
vide ideal relaxation after a sticky session
at the Foreign Office. To his dismay it
turned out to be T. S. Eliot’s reconstruc-
tion, in blank verse, of the killing of
.Thomas a’Becket
“Bulljo”: Bernard Shaw is certainly a
teetotaller (B. 25/2/’4B), but he claims a
good reason for his spurning of intoxi-
cants. In his introduction to W. H.
Davies’s Autobiography of a Super-
Tramp he confesses that his abstinence
is merely an application to the Shaw
family of the principle of division of
labor ; other members of the family drank
enough for ten.

“Macnell”: First of its kind in Aus-
tralia, a picture library opened at Edge-
cliff (N.S.W.) will attempt to bring art to
the suburbs. Entering to hire a book, the
shopper is expected to look around and
hire for the quarter a picture as well.
The patron thus has time to decide if
the painting suits his taste and his furni-
ture ; if satisfied, he can buy it by instal-
ments. All work is by Australian artists,
and if the idea catches on, as it has in
London, the three ladies running the show
aim at 20 more libraries through Sydney’s
suburbs.

“Pookie”; Bluey Mcßean, Dairy and
Piggery Instructor at Yanco Agricultural
High School before he joined the A.1.F.,
and now incumbent of a responsible post
on Lord Howe Island, is redheaded,
Scotch, and hates sloth and uncleanli-
ness like the devil. It is to his influence,
more than any other that I attribute
my giving the garbage-tins outside a
hamburger-shop a second glance while I
waited in the early morning for the place
to open. The tins, newly-emptied, were not
unlike the tins in which we used to cart
“I never knew they were hollow before."
offal from the kitchen to the piggeries;
but Bluey would have given us Gaelic hell
if he had ever caught us leaving any
piggery utensil in such a state. Re-
flecting that the tins would probably go
out in the obscure back of the shop, and
that their presence probably explained
the disquieting odor which seeped through
the smell of frying food, I watched the
preparations within. Hotplates were
wiped, counters and tables washed, clean
crockery and cutlery set out. Then the
doors opened, and a hireling dragged the
two garbage-tins in—but they didn’t go
out the back. He lifted them over the
counter and the cook carefully lined their
encrusted innards with clean newspaper
before turning to the sizzling steak and
bubbling eggs on the hotplate beside
them. Wondering what health inspectors
thought about all this —and suddenly de-
ciding to do without breakfast, after all
—I realised that health inspectors, unlike
Bluey, probably don’t get up early in
the morning.

“Old Mat”: There’s a whale of a lot
more to knifey than “Ike Hollar” (B.
3/ 3 / ’4B) listed. For instance, the cross-
armed throw while holding an ear, from
the tip of the nose, and —only as a
decider when both players were equal—
from the nails of each hand, with a final
throw over each shoulder. Players gener-
ally carried three or four knives, because
we played for a knife in those days;
often it was an old-timer with “tooth-
ache” blades that was handed over. The
champ at our after-school game was a
young lass whose deftness was remark-
able. She used a pearl-handled imple-
ment which had the uncanny habit of
dding the right thing.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Broome pearlers of
40 years ago had a “corpse-reviver” (B.
11/2//48) —a swig of squareface gin taken
first thing in the morning to restore life
to the carcass and wet the whistle for
the really serious drinking later in the
morning. Since it was simply a corpse
reviver, it didn’t need to be a big draught
—about a pint or so straight from the
bottle did the trick. These newfangled
concoctions must be pretty potent, judg-
ing by the small quantities required to
put such hard drinkers under the table.
Admittedly some of those old pearlers
may have felt some effect from the grog,
but even when we were burning-down
buildings and beating-up the police, none
of us ever seemed to be any the worse
for drink.

“Kelms”: “Genuine Scotch whisky”
bottles may harbor inferior liquid (B.
25/2/’4B), but a chap who made a for-
tune out of the Yanks when Perth was
a New York suburb at least gave them
a taste of the genuine article. “Sample
it,” he’d offer. And from any of the
dozen or so bottles that he was peddling
they could draw a nip of real Scotch,
sufficient to promote a quick sale. They
wouldn’t draw much more, because part-
way down the bottle was a layer of paraf-
fin wax, sealing-off the water with which
the bottle was nearly full, and keeping
the Scotch undiluted. He used black
bottles in which the wax didn’t show,
never worked the same place twice, and
made more money than a taxi-effiver.

“Laetitia”; The appearance of the
names of Luftwaffe members on a re-
cently unveiled Oxford University
memorial to ex-Oxonians killed in flying
operations supplies a factual counterpart
of an incident in Goodbye, Mr. Chips!
Hilton’s beloved dominie shocked his
fourth-formers by including in the names
of deceased schoolfellows honored by a
two-minute silence that of a former
German master who had been killed in
the field-grey of the Ist Wurtemburgers,
The explanation as put forward by the
fictional Mr. Chips for the benefit of his
pupils was not acceptable to those re-
sponsible for a memorial commemorating
ex-Harvard men who died with the Air
Force. It did not include ex-Harvardians
killed while flying for the Axis Powers.

“Craiser”: Addition to the treasures
of the National Gallery of a bust of
Einstein by Epstein led to some con-
fusion at the opening ceremony in Mel-
bourne. “I never did like Einstein,” said
one art connoisseur to another. “You
mean Epstein,” said the other. “No, I
mean Einstein,” said the first one. “But
he’s the mathematician.” “Oh, well, it
doesn’t matter anyway. They both mis-
handle figures,”

“Mullum”: Heth’s sketch —“Re our
application for supply of office furni-
ture”—brought to mind a scene in a city
furniture store during the war. A woman
brought back a card-table she had
bought, complaining that it was unsteady.
“Madam,” replied the salesman, “it is
only a card-table, and I can assure you
that a standard pack of cards is not heavy
enough to make it fall over.”
* * * *
“Ta’tahu”: Mention of Victorian
dowsers (B. 4/2/’4B) recalls one of the
most ingenious rackets in Australian
history. A N.S.W. farmer engaged a con-
tractor to sink a bore on his property,
working on a geological survey. After
the contractor had tried several places
without success a man turned up and
offered his services as a diviner. The
farmer would have none of him. “Oh,
well,” said the diviner, “I’m camping
down by the creek if you want me.” Ths
contractor continued his researches.
but after several hundred feet of bore
had been sunk without a skerrick of
moisture being found the
farmer capitulated to the powers of dark-
ness and sent for the dowser. He?
walked up a hill, had a struggle with
his magical stick, and water was struck
at 20ft. After the contractor and
the alleged diviner had left the district
the farmer discovered that they were
working in collaboration on departmental
records.

“Mark Time”: “Pawang” (B. 3/3/’4B>
is right in suggesting that Miss Keller’s
marvellous descriptions of scenery must
be the result of memories of what she
has heard rather than a realisation of
actual color. A young friend, blind from
early childhood, recently had an opera-
tion which gave her partial sight.
“Colors dazzle me,” she explained soon
after the operation. “I always imagined
everything in different shadings of grey.
I knew the sky was blue, but until I saw
it I had no actual conception of what
color it really was.” It was the same with
all other colors. She knew the names,
had no idea what they meant.
* * * *
“O. Sling”: Sydney’s recent 24-hour
transport strike has brought to light an-
other phenomenon of the times —workers
ordered by their employer to strike when
they were prepared to work against the
union’s direction. Three driver-employees
of a Sydney oil company reported for
duty on a stopwork day, but were told
not to carry out their normal duties as
it might mean the company being de-
clared “black.” As a logical development
of this attitude we may yet see the union
and the boss competing with reasons why
the worker should not work, with award
provisions for paid strikes and superan-
nuation for the toiler who reaches retir-
ing age after having been on strike for
the whole of his working life.

“W.P.T.”: ■ I have often wondered why
tram- and bus-tickets are not artistically
designed like postage-stamps. People
might then collect them as they collect
stamps; keen collectors might even take
tram and bus rides just to get the tickets.
As the tickets are not defaced like
postage-stamps they should have a
higher collectors’ value.

“Plop” gets responsibilities:
As the floor-Sister at the maternity hospital
beat her little gong we fathers and glowing
relations flattened our noses against the plate-
glass to regard the offspring. Up shot the
blind, and there was my first unmarried daughter
blowing raspberries at the mob. I showed her
my week-end baching supplies of two pounds
of bacon and a dozen eggs and she smiled
as her mother had, but they tell me that in
the little one’s case it’s wind. Possibly because
of bends in the glass, each family group coming
up to the window would exclaim; “Look at
him (or her, or them) —beautiful! Loveliest of
them all!” This was said of eight different
babies when even Cyclops could have seen
that the Plop filly won in a canter. I discovered
that this ten-second look they allow you at
the window is sufficient to bring on a condition
something like laryngitis in the father’s throat.
The disease also attacks his workmates, but in
a different form, causing them to clap their
hands over their ears and cry “Mastoids!”
whenever he comes near them'.
“4 Bees”: “Plop” was lucky merely
to get offerings from relatives for his
firstborn (B. 10/’3/’4B). When mine
arrived our mailbox was the repository
for several weeks of literature dealing
with feeding, care, knitting, insurance,
baby-foods and so forth, with at least
three leaflets advising contraceptives.
Just when we thought it had all died
down, a sample contraceptive arrived.

“His Nob”: Gather round, you crib-
players and mathematicians, and I shall
propound you a problem: Six of us have
been playing six-handed cabbage once a
week for years. The game is three aside,
thrice round the board, which is 180
holes. Each hand the two players next
after the dealer put their crib-card under
the pack, the other four making the crib.
Naturally, with seven hands out and six
taking part in the pegging, total scores
per deal are higher than in four-handed
crib. In our game, thrice round for 180
holes, one side or the other invariably
holes out on the sixth deal. Only three
times in six years has the deal gone to
the seventh round, and then only for the
sake of pegging two or three holes in a
close finish. And never has the game
ended before the sixth. What’s the
answer?
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHIES.
“Asked if he would outlaw the Communists, Mr.
Chifley replied that the Government did not pro-
pose to place bans on any class of political philoso-
phies.”
What odds to him though others choose
To brand the Corns, with bitter names,
As ruffians with subversive views
And traitors with disloyal aims?
With such a damning estimate
He’s quite unable to agree,
Holding their creed, he tells you straight,
A perfectly legitimate
Political philosophy.
What though they scheme from morn to night,
Their sinister objective plain,
To set the fires of war alight
In stricken Europe once again?
What though they’re costing Queensland dear,
He still regards them tolerantly,
Finds in their doings nought to fear ,
More than in any other mere
Political philosophy.
By any other name the rose
Would smell as sweet, was Shakspeare’s guess;
And similarly, I suppose,
The skunk renamed would stink no less.
But many a Com. and travelling pal
Have now Ben Chifley’s guarantees
That, far from being inimical,
They’re only one of several
Political philosophies.
Though of all menaces the worst
They’re deemed where’er our race holds sway,
With none so soundly, roundly cursed
Or acidly condemned as they,
Here, you may note, they’re classed and sized
Up by authority’s decree
As regularly legalised
Adherents of a recognised
Political philosophy.

“Bo”: I have a profound sympathy
for those men who cannot relax in a
barber’s chair. For myself, after the ton-
sorial artist has reduced by the electric-
clippers what is left of the coconut fibre
around ears and the nether portion of
my cranium to a microscopic stubble and
reaches for the scissors to prune a bit
off the top, I lean back languidly and
the comb and scissors playing over my
dome induce a beautiful soporific state
which I wish could go on indefinitely.
Certainly the fellow in the chair next to
me, with a tenuous fringe between his
ears at the back, scarcely seemed to justify
a visit, and it might have been this
realisation that prevented his enjoyment
of the proceedings. Within a minute
Snips had done all he could possibly do
and, evidently stricken with remorse at
the prospect of stinging the victim Is. 9d.
for so little, he began felling operations
among the scrub growing profusely out
the customer’s ears. Such a lightsome
lingering around the lug would have
wrought upon me a perfect ecstasy. But
what must this unimaginative clod do but
draw his head away and growl “Can’t
stand that —it irritates me.” To me such
a fellow is one with the brutes of the
field.

“Remfil”: Summers in Moscow are
melting both for quick and dead. Once
a year the black-marble mausoleum that
houses Lenin’s clay is shut for repairs to
its chief tenant. When I last saw him he
had just undergone his usual spring reno-
vation. The red-pointed beard looked
more pugnacious, the face and hands
swelled with embalming fluid, the full
evening dress with broad red sash (Order
of Lenin) dry-cleaned and pressed. All
was expertly done; he just might have
been napping prior to a diplomatic soirde,
so lifelike did he look. Outside on
the Red Square adjoining the Kremlin
half a million proletarians eight abreast
made the longest queue I ever saw. I
walked nonchalantly up to exercise my
“off-comer’s” right to go to the head of
the queue. But it wasn’t so easy as that.
As I thrust in there was a howl from a
minor appendix. “Come back,” they
cried. “This is the queue that has the
nght to go to the head of the queue.”

“C.Q.”; Melbourne shopkeepers have
thrown a grateful gleam of sunshine on
an otherwise bleak economic landscape.
After a complaint that retailers were
making thousands a week in unearned
profits by using faulty scales, a reporter
made a tour of city and suburbs. Of
22 purchases he made in the city, every
one was either correct or overweight when
tested at the Weights and Measures De-
partment. In Collingwood, Prahran and
Footscray the scales were found to be
even more heavily loaded on the side of
the consumer. Not a single sugar-and-
salt man was found cheating the public.
Whether this was due to a hasty adjust-
ment of the scales in expectation of a
visitation isn’t known. I prefer to think
it is a manifestation of the essential kind-
liness of human nature.

“Waarom”: Royal Melbourne Hos-
pital, which is holding a scientific con-
ference, has been wide open to the medi-
cal profession, and all the various depart-
ments in the vast building have been
asked to put a show on. Dr, Burnet, of
’flu serum fame, has his viruses, another
research-worker has his dead mice cut
into sections, and there have been dozens
of sideshows fascinating to the cogno-
scenti. Members of the staff were re-
quested to put up placards on their doors
indicating the particular thrill to be got
inside. One research man engaged in
collating statistical data he obtained in
the Marshall and Gilbert islands didn’t
want to be interrupted. He shoved up
on his door: “Don’t attempt to feed
this animal.”

“Tetapi”: It is probably luck that
more of the tragedies with stray munitions
recorded after the first world war haven’t
been repeated after the second, A Mel-
bourne citizen was recently greeted by
his nine-year-old son with “Come into
the backyard. We’ve got a live bomb.”
The startled parent got a horrified glimpse
of youngsters playing a game of catches
with two projectiles. After unscrewing
the fin from one of the objects he decided
not to trifle with the other, and took it
down the street to a Demolition Corps
man who pronounced it very much alive
and called in the police. The things were
traced back from one innocent kid to
another till they got to an infant who
said that, along with a quantity of others,
the bombs had been distributed by a
woman who had worked in a munitions
factory and used to bring them home for
the children to play with. She had left
the district. Perhaps it is too much to
hope that she had been blown up by one
of her own petards.

“Melbn”: There will be a study in con-
trasts at Newport (Vic.) railway work-
shops when the Royal coach comes in.
Still mouldering on its wheels is the
original State carriage built in 1859, one
of the oldest vehicles in Australia. Dur-
ing its 20 years of service it covered
every mile of Victoria’s expanding railway
system. Then for 40 years it served as a
dynagraph car for testing the drawbar
pull on locomotives. It was finally pen-
sioned off when a modern dynamometer
carriage was constructed.
* * * *
“Clooter”: Elastic as the language
must be if it is to live, there is some sort
of a threat in the way good words tend
to lose their meaning without the des-
troyers thereof providing a suitable sub-
stitute. I heard a woman speaker de-
scribing something she and the “other
girls” had achieved, none of them being
under 30. A night or so later a speaker
told how, on his travels, he met three
“married girls.” To me there is no such
thing as a married girl, marriage promot-
ing the young female to the status of
woman or, upon fulfilling her function,
matron. In my generation you could
have a baby girl, a schoolgirl, a young
girl. In our chivalry she could remain
a young girl, if unmarried, up to about
30, After that she was a spinster, a
miss, an old maid or, if you were un-
charitable, an “old girl.” This habit of
referring to women, whether married or
single, long past their youth, as “girls,”
arouses in the male breast a far stronger
“Right down the centre—and remember it's a non-smoker.”
coniempt than it ever held for the word
woman. Anybody who calls a mature
man a boy or a- group of mature men
boys is looking for trouble. Since both
girl and boy are meant to describe young
persons, this loose application of girls to
any sort of female ought to be outlawed.
When are we to hear some traveller speak
of meeting some “married boys”?

“W.P.T.”: Met a very saving bloke the
other day. “Rising costs don’t worry me,”
he said. “The more they rise the more
I save. I used to have a haircut once a
fortnight; when the price went up I
switched to once a month. When shoe
repairs went up I cut out wearing shoes;
that saved not only the cost of shoes but
also the cost of socks. I’ve joined the no-
hat brigade ; more expense saved. I used
to smoke two ounces of tobacco a week ;
now I mix my weed with gumleaves and
make it last a fortnight. I listen to the
radio in the dark to cut down the electric-
light bill, and I don’t buy newspapers,
but read them over the shoulders
of blokes in the train. For the
last three months I’ve been my own s.p.
bookmaker, and I’ve saved over a tenner
that I would have lost to the bloke at
the corner pub. It’s wonderful what a
man can save if he tries hard enough.”

“Cathode”: For some time British
harbors have been fitted with radar buoys
and beacons on which their radar-sets
con ships in. Maintaining her lead in
this field Britain has put into use at
Douglas, Isle of Man, a radar-controlled
harbor. The harbormaster scans his
fluorescent screen, and, in much the same
way as a warship plots the movements
of an enemy ship miles away, directs the
moving “pips” on his screen past shoals
and headlands by radio until berthing-
parties take the lines. London, Southamp-
ton and Hull are considering radar in-
stallation, which should do away with fog-
formed convoys waiting outside.
♦ * * *
“T. McN.”: In a kind of appeal to
me and several thousands more a Mr.
John O’Keefe, an executive director of
the Building Industry Congress, puts up
the sound argument that, as rising costs
prevent more and more people from
building homes, more and more builders
will stop building them and men will be
thrown out of work. But Mr. O’Keefe
couches the message in such pompous
jargon that few people will take the
trouble to read it. A sample:
Controls by regulation are delaying a
levelling-off in prices, yet we read of the
suggestion to extend restrictions on building
operations for a further period whilst the
coming appeal for permanent authority to
control prices portends an aggravation of
the position.
What the gentleman meant was that
although controls keep prices up more
controls are threatened, and if the Com-
monwealth Government wins its prices
referendum things will be a darned sight
worse. Why on earth couldn’t he say
something like that instead of befogging
everybody with “portends an aggravation
of the position?” We get far too much
of that jargon from the overblown
bureaucracy.

“Cap P.”: Mention of that de facto
wife (B. 10/3/’4B) recalls a love-nest
blundered upon in a tony Sydney suburb
by myself and an elderly census-collector.
The young man who opened the door
wore the aspect of dolor: he learned our
business and without a grin took the
census-sheet. As he filled it in a young
woman appeared, asked what he was at
and was told. She looked at us and
stood by, severe and uncompromising,
while the business was done. As my com-
panion checked the paper I looked over
his shoulder and saw the woman’s status
entered as “de facto wife.” The couple
watched us suspiciously as we read, alert
for any sign of amusement or dis-
approval. But we are both old poker-
players, and a de facto wife in the flesh
could no more move our physogs. than
three kings pat over a jackpot opener.
At the gate I looked back. The man
sat gloomily by the door, the woman
leaned on the verandah-rail, sullenly sur-
veying the garden. If there was happi-
ness in that house I’m a Dutchman.

“Melbn”; Australian history is a com-
pulsory subject in Victorian schools, but,
apparently compulsion achieves no better
results in education than it does in drink-
ing or any other of mankind’s habits. A
youth was asked by a group of New
Zealand tourists why that quaint little
ivy-covered cottage was standing in the
Fitzroy Gardens. “Well, y’ see,” he
said in tones of absolute conviction.
“That’s Captain Cook’s cottage. Captain
James Cook. He was the first feller to
discover that Australia was an island and
he sailed into Botany Bay with Batman
and claimed the blooming lot for Eng-
land. Then he founded Melbourne, and
as that was the cottage he lived in they
kept it and made a garden round it.”

slightly unsteady on their feet. “ ’Sail-

coalmining town of Brunnerton, on the
west coast of the South Island, will
celebrate the first discovery of coal in
Maoriland 100 years ago—Brunner, a sur-
veyor, was exploring in the vicinity when
he stumbled on an outcrop. The little
settlement was the scene of the most
serious mining disaster in the history of
M.L. when, jn 1896, a whole shift of 76
miners was wiped out by a fire-damp
explosion. Near Brunnerton the Sullivan-
Kelly bushrangers murdered a surveyor
named Dobson, mistaking him for a
banker. A cenotaph marks the spot, and
the locality where coal is now being
mined was called Dobson town.

“Bagot”: Nicknames cling to men for
a surprisingly long time; often to the
end of their days. Every unit had its
quota whose names were discarded by
their mates for something more in keep-
ing with appearance or mannerisms. One
of the favorites was Gandhi. Any
Digger whose bony frame suggested the
need of a good feed was a sitter for it;
there must be hundreds in Australia to-
day who are known to their war-time
cobbers only by that publicised name, I
can give personal testimony because on
the day following the Indian leader’s
assassination I automatically responded
to the greeting of “How are you,
Gandhi?” in a Perth street, and shook
hands with one whom I had pleasure in
addressing as “Scrounger.”
UNDER THE COUNTER.
The saying sub rosa or “Under the rose”
Is used, as undoubtedly anyone knows
Who studies our language judiciously,
To indicate something that’s spoken or done,
Devised or contrived, from the time it’s begun
To its ultimate end, surreptitiously.
From dim mythological times, I suppose,
The saying sub rosa or “Under the rose”
’Twas a tacit agreement “between me and you,”
A compact with no one admitted thereto
Of its puzzles to be the surraounter.
But old cliches may get out of date, and it goes
Without saying what used to be “Under the
rose”
Is nowadays “Under the counter,”
A localised form, it may be, of the game
But in all its essentials exactly the same.
It’s a bargain that’s seated with a nod or a
wink,
Or merely a meaning expression, I think,
And it holds the identical flavor
Of furtive transactions from under the rose,
And carries the closest resemblance to those
That go, same as kissing, by favor,
Though what it may be that such favor ensures
Is clearly no business of mine or of yours.
Though placards that goods are in scanty supply
Whene’er you go shopping encounter your eye
To save you from innocent blunder
In asking for things you’ve no hope to procure,
The worst of it is you can never be sure
They won’t be forthcoming from under
The counter for handing, when you’re out of
sight,
To Mr. —or Mrs., more probably—Right.

So rapid has been the industrial de-
velopment of Australia over the last
decade —especially since the end of hos-
tilities —that per capita consumption of
alkalis has about trebled during that
period. Moreover, the demand for them,
which i£ now a long way ahead of pro-
duction, continues to expand; and it
doesn’t look like contracting much in the
years ahead, either. So the co. has decided
to double the capacity of its big alkali
works at Osborne (S. Aust.) at an esti-
mated cost of over £1,000,000- —the
still-rising cost of labor, materials and
transport will bump up original esti-
mates.
These works, on which some £1,750,000
has already been spent, first carpe into
production in 1940. When complete, the
enlarged plant will be capable of turn-
ing out about 100,000 tons of alkalis
annually. These consist chiefly of soda
ash, caustic soda, bicarbonate of soda and
calcium chloride, and are produced by
treatment of salt obtained from evapora-
tion of sea water in beds covering an
area of some five square miles on the
shores of St. Vincent’s Gulf. The s'alt-
fields are to be extended, and increased
supplies of limestone are to be drawn
from a new quarry at Penrice, near An-
gaston. The main fuel used is coal from
N. S. Wales,, though a limited amount of
the sub-bituminous stuff from Leigh
Creek has been burned during parts of
the process. Caustic soda is also turned
out in liquid form in conjunction with
chlorine and its derivatives at Botany
(N.S.W.), where a strike held up produc-
tion for 10 months to end August, 1947,
and at Yarraville (Vic.), where new plants
for production of pesticide and selective
weed-killer are scheduled to be in opera-
tion next month.
The explosives factory at Deer Park
(Vic.), operated by a subsidiary, Nobel
(Aust.) Pty., is being further mechanised
and enlarged at an estimated cost of about
£300,000, thus bringing it “into line with
the most up-to-date units in the world.”
Though explosives were first manufac-
tured in Australia in 1874, it was not until
shortly before the last war that the
country became independent of overseas
supplies. Recent developments in mining
technique alone have greatly expanded
the industrial market for explosives, as
well as given it a new element of per-
manence.
Other major components of the group’s
range of manufactures are dyes, leather-
cloth, fertilisers, synthetic ammonia and
slide-fasteners; output is expanding in
each case. Now it is proposed to pioneer
nylon extrusion in Australia. Initial pro-
duction will include filaments for brushes,
fishing-casts and tennis-racquet strings.
The policy has been to add one unit to
another, until today a series of inter-
dependent industries has been established
by the research and other efforts of a
team pf chemists, physicists, metallurgists,
engineers and others.
Despite industrial disturbances and
shortages of materials, fuel and man-
power, last year’s sales were a record.
The improvement in net earnings
(£463,024) was £49,722. That was after
deducting outside interests and allowing
£271,745 (up £11,855) for depreciation
and £378,296 (up £127,769) for taxation,
but leaves out of the reckoning £77,083
dropped from somewhere into reserves,
as well as adjustments connected with a
newly-acquired subsidiary. The £463,024
of profit covered pref. requirements and
7.5 p.c. on ord. capital as against 6.6, 4.7
and 6.9 p.c. for the three preceding years.
The div. was kept at 5 p.c

new subsidiary) is the outstanding feature

To meet the year’s growth of £397,010 in
fix'ied assets, £1,555,894 in stocks and
£513,388 in debtors’ balances the board
leant upon sundry creditors for an extra
£782,306, reduced investments by
£526,225 and drew upon cash for
£264,524.
At the annual meeting on March 8
nominal capital was doubled by creation
of 7,500,000 new £1 shares.. Of these
2,500,000 ords. are to be offered to exist-
ing ord. holders —largest of these is
1.C.1. (London); others are the big mining
cos. at the Barrier, 8.H.P., A.C.1., Electro-
lytic Zinc and Commonwealth Fertilisers.
The new money is wanted to complete
additions at Osborne, Deer Park, Yarra-
ville and elsewhere. When it is all in paid
capital will be £8,953,329, which includes
a million of 5 p.c. pref. money put up by
the Australian public at end 1938. At

Earnings of this Sydney real-estate busi-
ness reflect the vicissitudes of the metro-
politan property market. And here is
what has happened in connection with
Sydney property sales over the last 20-
odd years:—

During the 1920’5, when properties some-
times changed hands two and more times
a year, divs. averaged 20.6 p.c. Then
slump and Langism brought a collapse of
values, and shareholders went without
for three years to end 1933. During the
half-dozen years that followed distri-
butions advanced from 6 p.c. to 12 p.c„
the average being 9.8* p.c. World War II
brought restrictions that reduced real-
estate turnover to a trickle, and reserves
were tapped for £3124 to pay divs. averag-
ing 7.8 p.c. for the five years to end 1944.
Under pressure of deferred demand and
owing to partial easing of restrictions —
still harsh and inequitable—sales revived
in 1945 and 1946, and the co. paid 10 p.c.
and 15 p.c. respectively.
Last year there was shrinkage of 41.1
p.c. in city and of 10.6 p.c. in suburban
sales; this not because of any lack of
genuine demand but because sellers
were unwilling to sacrifice their properties
at pegged prices, and because buyers were
unable to go ahead with new building,
owing to the bottlenecks in materials and
labor. Pegged prices take no heed what-
ever of depreciation in the value of the
currency, and they give very tardy recog-
nition to the natural increase in value of
property that follows the growth and
spread of population and industrial acti-
vity.
For political rather than economic
reasons the official mind remains
moored to the price buoy of early 1942,
which has been allowed to rise by only
10 p.c. or thereabouts at the discretion
of the Treasury. Yet in some of the grow-
ing suburbs the natural increase in land
values ranges from 50 p.c. to as much as
100 p.c. It is not surprising, therefore,
that sellers have gone into their shells,
hoping that the Government might be-
come less discriminating and more equit-
ably minded later on. As at present
administered. Government control over
land transfers, prices and building
materials has been responsible. for the
blackmarkets in land sales and labor and
materials. And by its own excursion into
the field of homebuilding, the Govern-
ment is sowing the seeds of much future
trouble in connection with capital values
and rents, for which the taxpayer will
foot the bill in the long run.
The year’s shrinkage in R. and W.’s
commission earnings, etc. —the scale of
charges was fixed over 25 years ago—
was £9956:
1939. 1942. 1946. 1947.

Exes, (down £3693), which are not
anchored, made off with 81.8 p.c. of
commissions, etc., as against 69.6 p.c. in
the previous year. Thus net earnings
(down £6263) dropped to 9.2 p.c. on
capital compared with 21.2, 14.3, 3.8,
6.6, a loss, 17.1 and 10.9 p.c. back to
1940. Only two and a half points were
chipped off the div., reducing it to 12i
p.c., the final being at the rate of 10 p.c.

At the close of accounts in 1946 an assets-
revaluation reserve of £20,999 was created
by writing up the book value of “certain
assets on the basis of original cost, less
depreciation allowed by the taxation com-
missioner.” Freehold was the item in-
volved, and it is still worth a lot more
than its book value. The intention was
to use £19,773 of this reserve to make
a one-for-four bonus-share issue; but
the Treasury in its wisdom, and for un-
stated reasons, refused its consent. This
looks like petty interference in details
of co. finance, which, so far as the public
is concerned, has no economic conse-
quences worth mentioning.
However, to help finance expansion of
the business, 20,700 new £1 shares were
offered those on the register at May 23
last at a premium »f 4s. each. That
lifted paid capital to £lOO,OOO, and
brought in £4140 of share premiums,
which were tossed into reserves. The
issue was in the nature of a bonus to
shareholders because of the premium at
which the old scrip stood in the market;
also the new shares carried divs. at the
declared rate of 12£ p.c. for the full year,
though the premium reduced the 12£ p.c.
to an effective 10.2 p.c.
The co. is an old-established tannery
concern, first set on its feet by John
Charles Ludowici as far back as 1858,
Which now turns out a wide range of
leather beltings and industrial leathers and
does a substantial business as power trans-
mission engineers. A growing export
trade with nearby Asiatic countries had
been built up pre-war, and a couple of
years ago the industrial glove-making
business of Kent Mfg. Co. Pty. was
taken over, and is contributing to profits.
Profits have been irregular over the
last three years. The drop in 1945 was
due to industrial disturbances, which
interrupted the power-supply, reduced
turnover and bumped up unit costs. In
the following year the co. was more for-
tunate in these respects, and exceptional
exports of “merchant lines handled in
conjunction with ordinary business” sent
net earnings to a record level. Exports
of lines manufactured in the co.’s own
plants were relatively small.
Last term export sales of these
“merchant fines,” which carried wider
profit-margins than the co.’s own
products, fell away sharply, as the
board had predicted. So, although
sales of the co.’s own manufactures ex-
panded, there was a contraction of £6042
in net earnings (£11,589), which were
11.5 p.c. on capital as against 22.1, 10.6,
15.4, 13.2, 17.5 and 15.9 p.c. back to
1941. The 5 p.c. special bonus sent out
in the previous year was dropped, leav-
ing the div. at 12£ p.c., which called for
£916 more than the profit claimed.
Now that both the volume and rate of
profit on exports have fallen, the ques-
tion is whether the 12| p.c. div. can be
maintained. The chairman says “the co.
is dependent upon either a reduction in
labor and material costs, or a price in-
crease, if losses are to be avoided.” The
co. is still operating on selling-prices fixed
in 1941, expansion of turnover, includ-
ing the exports just mentioned, having
meanwhile more than offset rising costs.
The management has, therefore, again
asked the prices authority to sanction a
lift in selling-prices of lines manufac-
tured for the home market —previously
an application to do this was turned
down.
The new capital and share-premium
money went mainly into stocks (up
£19,149) and book debts (up £8593):

You may not know it, but tyre cord can be
as variable as the weather. Heat, cold, dampness
and dryness can all affect the strength of a tyre
cord. To protect your investment in tyres and
perhaps your life Goodyear has the intricate
machine shown above. This machine, tests cords
in temperatures ranging from 20°F. below to
400°F. above zero. It stretches and strains cord
that’s soaking wet, and the same cord bone dry.
Unless the cord can withstand the Goodyear break-
ing test under all these conditions, it isn’t good
enough for you, or for Goodyear. Perhaps that
helps to explain why Goodyear tyres hold their
lace as the world’s first choice
Jor the 33rd consecutive year.

Mountain View Gold N.L. (W.A.)
Registered in Perth in Sept,
last with a nominal capital of
£200,000 in 4s. shares, of which
187,500 are issued and f.-p., this
co. is now offering those on the
register a further 562,500 shares,
three-for-one, at par. When that
lot is fully subscribed and all the
money in, paid capital will be
£150,000. The £112,500 now
asked for is wanted to meet
balance of vendor’s considera-
tion, £99,000 (£136,500, less
£37,500 deposit paid and value
of gold and cash on hand), and
pay cost of investigation, pre-
liminary exes., etc., £5500, leav-
ing £BOOO working capital. The
mine is to be equipped and
worked out of profits. The
shoots in the Mountain View are
part of the northern extension
of the old Great Fingall quartz
vein. Ore in the Fingall was
richest above (1000 ft., and con-
tinued in diminishing values
down to 2000 ft. In Mountain
View the vendors got £325,000
from treatment of 8355 tons ore
taken from between 200 ft. and
370 ft. during 1942-47. A report
by Anglo-Western Mining Pty.
shows there is 100 ft. of backs
below the 370 ft. level worth
about £137,500, and another
£40,000-worth of ore from
470 ft. to 520 ft. Latest de-
velopments at 520 ft. indicate that
the ore-body is similar to that
between 370 ft. and 470 ft., and is
still going strong underfoot.
Gold in the shoot occurs in
streaks, 3in. to 12in. wide, which
contain some rich specimen ore.
It is expected to treat 250 tons
a month for a recoverable value
of £9OOO, of which costs are
expected to take £2OOO, leaving
a profit of £7OOO, or £84,000
p.a., equal to 56 p.c. on £150,000
of capital. There are other
shoots in the mine yet to be
tested, and co. holds options
over three adjoining leases not
so far examined. On the board
are George Moss, R. P. S. Burt
and A. R. Williams.
“Estus”:
With about half a dozen worth-
while producers the old Wol-
fram Camp mining field (N.Q.) is no
reflection of the marvellous price
of wolfram —£5 80-odd a ton for 70
p.c. tungsten at end January. This,
placed alongside the 1914-18 price of
£lBO, when working leases were num-
bered by the hundred and English
and French cos. spent hundreds of
pounds on the field, gives one
cause to reflect on the strangu-
lation of taxation. The absence
of a fixed price is another bar to
investment of capital. Men of sub-
stance have stated that with a guar-
anteed price of £3OO for 10 years
and liberal tax concession they are
prepared to invest heavily. Govern-
ment assistance on the field is good
and practical. The small Ingersoll-
Rand air winches leased to the miners
for a nominal £1 a month are ide«l
for the jotf, and though the com-
pressor units provided are cumber-
some and, along with the jack-
hammers, not always in the best of
repair, they do the job and are a
big improvement on hand steel. Fail-
ing introduction of substantial capital
and large-scale working, the alterna-
tive seems to be subdivision of the
large leases, some of which are held
by the expedient of working a small
claim in a remote corner.

Latest entry in Meekatharra
Sands Co.’s log, a call of 6d. a
share in March, will make the
'scrip paid to 2s. 6d. Strikes in
the transport industry delayed
operations considerably and in-
creased initial plant-construc-
tion costs, while machinery sup-
plier’s charges exceeded original
estimates because of lifts: in
wage and material costs. It was
hoped to make good this excess
expenditure from' the first few
months of treatment, but
mechanical and metallurgical
difficulties made this impossible.
Extra plant had to be bought
and installed. From Feb. 6 to
March 1, during which opera-
tions ceased for 12 days on
account of a cyclone, 4100 tons
sands were treated for an esti-
mated recovery of 160 oz. fine
gold, an average of Bs. sd. a ton.

Blue Spec’s chairman
gleefully announced the other
day that milling of 1118 tons ore
in January had shown a profit
—first since treatment began—
of £1249. He added that ore
assaying loz. 2dwt. gold per ton
over a width of 48in. had been
exposed in the east winze below
No. 3 level. The two statements
have strengthened hopes of opti-
mistic shareholders that pay-
ment of a div. is in the offing.

After drawing a number of
blanks, ever-optimistic Cool-

got a prize. It has bought for
£2500, plus 10 per cent, gold
won, the Phar Lap mine at
Meekatharra (W.A.). A three-
penny call has been made to
help finance the deal and erect
a battery and plant. Before the
purchase price was paid a test
parcel of 400 tons was crushed
for an average yield of B|dwt.
The directors say “prospects of
securing enrichments at any
time cannot be discarded.”

The Way Ahead
Mr. Chifley has at last, about
two years later than anyone else
in a similar position in any
English-speaking country, told
the “Labor” movement that in-
dustrial production will need to
be increased greatly if economic
disaster is to be avoided.
“Money and credit,” he says,
“are useless if we do not pro-
duce the goods. The world
needs our foodstuffs and our
manufactures, and Australia is
in a position to supply them,”
Even though Mr. Chifley will
get little more than a scornful
laugh from many people for
attempting to offer economic
leadership at this desperately
late stage of things—what he is
saying now for the first time
has been reiterated times with-
out number in these pages for
years past, and by industrialists,
bankers, Chambers of Commerce
and Manufactures and by
members of the Opposition —
there are others who will hope
that the Prime Minister is sincere
in his present belated concern,
that now, when he is talking also
about a balanced Budget this
year, he has observed the obvious
light and, an economic sinner
repentant, is going to see the
right thing done by the country.
Mr. Chifley is essentially a
“Labor” politician, and at no
time in his political career has
he shown any tendency to put
country before party: he has
been to the fore in “Labor’s”
socialistic plans, notably the
Bank Grab Act, and he has
toyed with all kinds of legislative
and financial monkeying based
on doctrines and politics instead
of facing the realities of pro-
duction and government. His
head has been full of socialism
and class-prejudice, of short-cut
methods and expedients. He is
a stubborn man ; but he must be
blind as well as stubborn if he
does not believe the warnings he
gave the Macquarie Assembly
of the A.L.P. last week.
“Production is the greatest
weapon against a depression,”
said Mr. Chifley, and again he
spoke the truth —with what con-
viction only time will reveal.
His Government will have to
turn its socialistic philosophy
and industrial attitude inside-out
in order to back up this sudden
outburst of apparent frank com-
monsense. And those “Labor”
characters who are in politics for
what they get out of it will have
to think in terms other than of
Yarra-bank humbug. No time
must be wasted on propagating
the class-war if production is
really to be built up into an effec-
tive weapon against depression.
Depression is one thought to
concern us ; but another’is pros-
perity—real prosperity. We have
not had prosperity in this country
since 1939, and “Labor” asser-
tions to the contrary have been
pure political misrepresentation.
The large volume of paper-
money that has been a feature
of the Australian economy since
1942 has not brought a propor-
tionate increase in living
standards. But it has de-
moralised and confused a large
section of the community, as
well as promoting a great
amount of “employment” that is
useless or vicious. The whole
rotten setup has been exploited
to the full by “Labor” men and
fellow-travellers who have found
politics a well-paying racket.
Political exploitation of the
country from Canberra will
have to cease before we feel
certain that we can clear away
those factors which attract de-
pressions to permit us to lay the
foundations of real economic
progress for the community.
With its great economic
and legislative “controls,”
which have operated with little
mercy or reason towards private
initiative, enterprise and thrift
for the best part of six years,
“Labor” has stood as a mon-
strous obstruction to the develop-
ment of our resources and an
increase in our living standards.
Communist wreckers have
moved in on the “Labor” party.
IJnder “Labor” - Communist
dictatorship Australian industry
has withered, sapping the
country’s productivity. Working
hours have been reduced per
week, production per man-hour
has fallen, and the right to work,
which was what “Labor” once
asked for, has degenerated into
the right to strike and paralyse
all industrial activity. And any
person possessing a healthy
desire to work has usually been
denounced and intimidated by
his union. Bonuses for extra
“We lost our bank revolver .”
production have been forbidden
by “Labor,” incentive-payments
outlawed by the A.C.T.U.
Yet the youth of this country,
on the whole, desires to do good
for itself; it wants to carve out
a high standard of living and
establish a national prestige.
Attempts have been made from
a multitude of “Labor”-Com-
munist strongholds to pervert
the nation’s youth: to feed it
with sophistries, to generate class-
hatred, to weaken its national
independence, to belittle its fight-
ing men, to encourage greed and
sharp-practices.
The “Labor” - Communist
setup is very similar to a
highly - organised dope - ring ;
today it stands out as a racket
that depends for its power and
profit on the peddling of con-
fused doctrines that in the end
mean national suicide. But Can-
berra “Labor” party is filling its
pockets meanwhile with in-
creased salaries, etc., and pre-
paring for any electoral eventu-
ality by establishing a pension
scheme for defeated Parliamen-
tarians on a scale of liberality
unknown to disabled service-
men and other worthy citizens.
The evil works of the Com-
munists amount to blatant
treachery, against which the
Chifley Government is obviously
afraid to act, for reasons best
know to itself.
Scourged of the degenerate
and decrepit “Labor” political
racket, and with Communists de-
ported to their spiritual homes
or otherwise effectively handled,
the future of Australia would be
bright indeed. It is well over 90
p.o. British in population, its
natural resources are becoming
more widely appreciated by
Britain itself, there is a great in-
quiry by desirable European mi-
grants for homes and jobs here,
and British capital and skill have
never been so keen to transplant
themselves to the Common-
wealth. Let no Australian of in-
tegrity swallow the proposition
that this country is beaten just
because of its present political
misfortunes. Our real fortune
will be great indeed if only the
“Labor”-Communist miasma is
effectively dispelled by a resur-
gence of political sanity and
social integrity.
The opportunity of major
nationhood today presents itself
before this southern continent as
it has never done before. Dis-
tance is being annihilated by
aerial transport, we have the
safest flying conditions in the
world, our climate is mostly
temperate and healthy, and other
English-speaking peoples are be-
ginning to realise that there is a
kinship in the tongue and the
race that stands up under the
worst of world conditions.
But we are still a pioneer
country in the sense that
initiative and enterprise will
count amongst our greatest
assets in any development
that is to come. There-
fore hard work must be re-
spected and rewarded, and the
greater production of wealth for
all must be made the basis of
our social security. Before that
is in sight, however, there will
need to be a return to political
decency and honesty, and the
putrid “Labor”-Communist doc-
trines of the past six years
must be treated with an appro-
priate disinfectant.
Two brewery issues of 100,000
shares each have made the grade
under Maoriland’s capital-issues
control (that is, the Minister of
Finance) since the year opened.
The first, by Ballins Breweries
(N.Z.), Ltd., Christchurch, to re-
pay the co.’s debentures, raised
capital to £350,000. The second,
by Dominion Breweries, Ltd.,
Auckland, gave shareholders’ the
chance to get 100,000 ords,
at a premium of £ for £, in pro-
portion of two new shares for
every seven held. This resumed
D.B.’s interrupted sequence of
capital issues, at premiums of
2s. 6d. (1936), 7s. 6d. (1937), ss.
(1938) and 2s. 6d. (1939), which
lifted capital to £350,000, includ-
ing £40,000 pref., before the war
called a halt. D.B. has been car-
ried along on a prosperity wave
for 12 years since it extended
leasehold and freehold control
to more than 30 hotels and
, got firmly established in
production. Growing public
thirst, swelled by Ameri-
can G.ls. in war days, has kept
expanding plant going at capa-
city, and the financial hurdle of
mortgages and overdrafts is now
well behind. Chairman Len
Stevens warned shareholders last
year that costs were chasing
profits and threatening to out-
strip them, but there is no sign
of any setback to Dominion
Breweries yet.

Shares Lower
In a mixed (atmosphere re-
sulting from conditions at home
and overseas, Australian share-
markets lost strength again last
week. The long - drawn - out
Queensland strike, the difficulty
of restoring production under
present conditions of Com-
munist control of unions, rising
costs under the 40-hour week,
the continuance of Federal price-
control as a shock-absorber to
Canberra “Labor’s” financial
and industrial mismanagement,
and the inequitable and heavy
taxation of companies have all
tended to cause hesitation among
buyers on ’Change. Overseas
the price position has changed,
especially for wheat, and the
possibility of another war looms
in Europe.
The market approaches l all
these problems in a frame of
mind confused by what can be
described as a normal reaction
from overspeculation. We had
a strongly-rising sharemarket for
most of 12 months. It attracted
many gamblers who bought for
trading profits, not for income.
The hopes of such speculators
have been shattered by the
sharp setback of the past two
months, and these speculators
are now unloading, often at a
loss, and support for stocks
is consequently more restricted
to investors. There is likely to
be a larger volume of new capi-
tal issues this year than last,
and that would normally tend
to absorb surplus investment
funds; but, of course, if the
Federal Budget should balance
this year it will mean that there
will be a smaller call for public
borrowing.
In spite of all present disturb-
ing factors investors should not
worry much about the prevail-
ing weakness of the market.
With ordinary shares in mind, it
is hard indeed to see; any better
available method of protecting
savings against the inflation that
is continuing in spite of lower
prices for our exports, and the
long-term prospects of sound in-
dustrial shares are very promis-
ing. Chifleyism and Commun-
ism appear to be on the way
out, in which case, a freer
economy should yield a more
abundant production in which
all, including shareholders,
would participate with a re-
duced liability for taxation.
Maoriland Manpower
Employers in New Zealand
have plenty of headaches.
Restive workers, poor labor per-
formance, rising wages, competi-
tive bidding against one another
for men, women, boys and girls,
go-slows and strikes, scarcity of
steel and other basic materials,
soaring costs and crushing taxes
have got nearly all of them
worried. Sounds like a parallel
to Australia’s crop of troubles,
but Maoriland is worse off, with
its small labor pool, loosely
organised industry (mostly in
small units), and import bottle-
necks for steel, coke and a score
of other things industry must
have if it’s to be red-blooded
and alive.
Auckland’s mayor, Jack
Allum, warned M.L. manufac-
turers at their February con-
ference that the time had arrived
to call a halt on industrial
frontiers while population was
given a chance to get level.
Minister of Industries and Com-
merce A. H. Nordmeyer half-
agreed, but ostrich-like couldn’t
or wouldn’t see the real posi-
tion. Against his claim that
immigration—only a trickle yet
—is “taking up the slack,” and
that “industry has outstripped
our manpower resources only to
a slight extent,” there is the pic-
ture of employment going from
bad to worse for months past.
Many managements are in a
desperate fix. Demand has out-
run supply in labor channels by,
probably, 20 per cent. This
means M.L. needs 40,000 more
workers in industry.
Knight James Fletcher, un-
crowned king of building and
construction, who was Com-
missioner of Works in war days
and did a great job, lately fol-
lowed up warnings from other
quarters by using the lash on
employers themselves. He told
them at the end of February that
their “foolish” moves were
menacing the whole rickety
wage-structure. Bidding up-
wards in cut-throat competition
to draw men, even to the point
of taking them out of one in-
dustry and putting them into an-
other, must end in disaster, he
said.
Ex-president Bill Truscott, of
the Manufacturers Federation,
called for co-operation in place
of rivalry. He wanted “incen-
tive-payments based on produc-
tion,” an aim he shared with
M.L.’s Opposition-leader Sid
Holland —who, on present poli-
tical analyses, will be New Zea-
land’s next Prime Minister —but
so far they’re voices crying in
the wilderness. So long as costs
can be passed on to the public
in prices that keep climbing, the
main body in business and in-
dustry won’t change. Only
when the public has had enough
will they be open to persuasion.
Moneyspinning in New Zea-
land in the first two post-war
years was at double the pre-
war rate and not a great way
below the do-or-die pace of war
days. In eight years M.L.’s
volume of money has more than
trebled, and it hasn’t touched
ceiling yet. If the banks’ brake
on credit, applied last year, is
beginning to tell it’s acting very
gently, or maybe the inflation
bandwagon had so much
weight on it takes a lot of pul-
ling up. Tightening purse-strings
goes against Labor’s grain. It is
12 years since Labor got into
the saddle in Maoriland, and
the younger generation of
Maorilanders has grown up with
the idea that there’s no limit to
onward and upward on the
money front. They have never
seen or felt a swing-back, and
don’t believe it. If money has
snowballed to more than £lB6
million, against £6l million in
1939, that doesn’t bother them,
unless, perhaps, they want to
buy, build, equip or furnish a
home and get it in the neck in
sky-high prices. Money-volume
has gone from £4O million to
4\ times that during Labor’s
spree—a shade over £12,000,000
a year. Some going for little
Maoriland, with not much morp
than Sydney’s population.
A youngish Australian abroad,
asked by the father of a Sydney
lass to look the girl up in Lon-
don, dutifully called at the only
address provided—the London
office of an Australian bank.
The bank chap interviewed was
English, youngish, baldish, ex-
officerish and possessed a luxuri-
ant moustache as well as a deep-
down twinkle in his eye. He
took on a soberish attitude when
asked for the young lady’s ad-
dress. “Hmm. . .We have to
protect our clients’ confidence,”
he said, “Especially female
clients away from home,” he
added, gazing directly into
the eyes of the Australian, and
slightly curling one end of his
“mo.” The Australian began to
feel embarrassed. “But,” said
the bank official, “I’ll ring
through to our correspondence
department. One moment.”
Returning, he ushered the Aus-
tralian in and stood by solemnly
while the mail-clerk also
youngish, etc. —gave his verdict.
“W-e-e-11,” said that official,
subjecting the visitor to a grave
inspection. “Perhaps we can
make an exception to our rule in
this case. Hmm, yes. Well, the
young lady’s address is: ‘Care
of Australia House.’ Try
them!” Then all three started
laughing—led by the Australian.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Australian
Period Piece.
Dorothy Blewitt’s “The First
Joanna,” a play which won £lOO
in the Playwrights’ Advisory
Board competition, is written
with the excellent intention of
making Australians aware of
their traditions.
Staged by May Hollinworth’s
Metropolitan Players at Reiby-
place, Sydney, it fulfilled its pur-
pose entertainingly by bringing
into living reality the Governor
of a Tasmanian jail, his decora-
tive wife and daughter, a convict
servant, a gentleman who is go-
ing to grow grapes in South Aus-
tralia, some attractive period sets
and period furniture and a
thoroughly satisfying villain in a
red coat.
When the vinegrower elopes
with the convict girl, and when
she, later, is blackmailed by the
satisfying villain and shoots him
dead in his satisfying red coat,
the audience has seen Australian
history in person. It is melo-
dramatic, no doubt, and it has
been done many times by the
novelists, but it is comparatively
new to the stage, and it is fascin-
ating. It is like one of J. H. M.
Abbott’s short-stories dramatised
—and, incidentally, film-makers
and playwrights would find
Abbott a mine of invaluable
material.
Miss Blewitt, unfortunately,
thought it necessary to point the
moral about Australian history
and, through her heroine,
preaches disconcertingly to the
audience about the dangers of
respectability and absurdity of
being ashamed of the colorful
and violent days of old. This is
partly justified by her central
theme —a young, modern wife
in rebellion against a heavy
family tradition —but it is over-
done.
The author should have let
the past speak for itself ; and the
opening and closing scenes in
modern times, if not entirely
omitted, should have been cut to
a very brief prologue and epi-
logue: especially as they consist
of dull, repetitive domestic
wrangling, with the hero talking
unconvincing stuff about his “in-
escapable fealty to the soil.” A
further disadvantage in these
scenes, hardly the author’s fault,
was that a group of American
visitors —particularly an alleged
playboy—lacked all conviction.
An unscrupulous admiration
for the villain, played by Marcel
Wattel, makes a fair judgment
of the other actors —except John
Meillon’s captivating small boy
—difficult: the more so because
the prolonged first and last acts
gave the author insufficient time
to develop her historical char-
acters to the full. But John
Bushelle, Dinah Shearing, Lynne
Murphy, Betty Lucas and Wanda
Herbert were a capable com-
pany.
"Marriage of Figaro."
The Australian opetatics at
Melbourne Princess turned from
Verdian blood-and-thunder to
this sparkling comedy of Mozart
and did it in a remarkably effi-
cient manner. In fact, the rush
and excitement of the compli-
cated story could hardly have
been better given, which was
something of an achievement, as
probably few of the performers
had ever made a previous
appearance, and Mozart’s opera,
both in the acting and the music,
demands an instant response to
the mood of the moment.
Only Count Maxwell Cohen
Almaviva was a trifle heavy,
though he compensated with his
singing. Morris Williams was
perfectly fitted to the part of the
count’s valet who is inordinately
busy in frustrating the amorous
designs of the latter on his. wife’s
maid, Susanna. In the “Non
piu andrai” solo, with its mag-
nificent fanfare - like refrain,
“Cherubino on to Victory, on to
Military Glory Go,” he got the
applause of a packed house.
Muriel Howard was a
vivacious Susanna, but lacked a
few pounds in vocal tonnage and
was sometimes obscure in
enunciation. One of the interest-
ing things about the perform-
ance was. that the opera, done
into English and with the reci-
tative spoken in plain language,
proved a much more witty busi-
ness than it does in Italian.
Barbara Wilson gave a charm-
ing vignette of the senseless
Cherubino, and Kathleen Good-
all was excellent as the countess.
Frank Mithen, William Crougey,
Ivy Ferguson and Harry Jen-
kins, as the rest of the crew of
intriguers, did nothing to let
down the show, which was the
best that director William P.
Carr has presented. Except in
a few places the exuberance of
the instrumentalists was kept
well in check by conductor
Joseph Post.
New Gallery Paintings.
Eight pictures, bought in
London, have been received by
the N. S. Wales National
Gallery. They are; “Grey Day,
Battersea” (£126), by Walter
Greaves; “The White Bowl”
(£120), by Geoffrey Tibbie;
“Nocturne in Silver and Grey”
(£600), by Whistler ; “Self Por-
trait (£105), by W. R. Sickert;
“Wheat Stooks” (£126) and “The
Stack” (£126), by W. Nicholson
and “Garden Study” (£180) and
“Wheat Field at 'Starlings”
(£200), by S. Spencer.
The Whistler had not yet
been hung when this was written.
Of the other pictures, Sickert’s
“Self Portrait” was, on a cloudy
day, practically invisible and
might almost be called “A Study
in Brown,” being a long, narrow
portrait of a long young man
with, beneath the brownness,
something of the easy strength
of a Longstaff. As a specimen
of Sickert’s work it is, however,
disappointing.
Spencer’s “Wheat Field at
Starlings” is, perhaps, the most
interesting picture shown, its
hard clarity being assisted by a
position in the main hall.
Spencer’s technique and his
careful realism are impressive, as
is his composition, but the judg-
ment that he “builds like a brick-
layer” is not unjustified. There
is no joyousness and, in the hard
angles of shadows and the dead-
true lines of trees, stalks and —
coming to the foreground—
fenceposts, no subtlety.
Oils and watercolors by J.
Noel Kilgour (Macquarie Gal-
leries, Sydney) show technical
dexterity and energy, but little
life. Some studies of childhood
are interesting, particularly as
the artist has had the courage
to tackle large compositions, but
their interest lies in that lower
category of art represented by
colored advertisements, A por-
trait of Norman Carter is waxy,
an extreme example of a pervad-
ing weakness in all the figure
studies. In the landscapes skies
are the artist’s undoing. One
watercolor, “The Tethered
Calf,” is a charming and indi-
vidual piece of observation, with
each unambitious detail, from
the leaning shed to the calf’s out-
thrust head and arched tail, ex-
actly right. More watercolors
and more observation of Nature
would appear to be the right
artistic track for Kilgour.
* * * *
C. Dudley Wood is giving his
annual show of oils and water-
colors at Melbourne Athenaeum.
This time he applies his familiar
formula to all the loveliest bits
of coastline from San Remo to
Narooma, with a couple of ex-
cursions into the Blue Moun-
tains. His “Mount Isolation” is
closest to commercial art; his
“Passing Showers” furthest from
it.
* * * ♦
Norman Krasna’s “D ear
Ruth,” put on by Brisbane’s
Twelfth Night Theatre, is a
clever, well-constructed comedy
with excellent dialogue. The
play was well cast and the
players made the most of their
opportunities. James Stephens,
as the father, gave a comedy
performance of considerable
polish—he has the light touch,
and his timing is excellent.
Althea Pearson, as the younger
daughter, appeared to enjoy her-
self as much as the audience en-
joyed her portrait of that mon-
strous child. John Miller gave
more character to the “Loo”-
tenant than was written into the
part. As Ruth, Beryl Brennan
was more effective in her serious
scenes than in the more riotous
ones. The show was produced
at a good pace by Rhoda Fel-
gate, and the set was both in-
genious and attractive.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Mozart’s sparkling and amusing “Mar-
riage of Figaro,” the fourth opera to be
presented by the National Theatre Move-
ment, drew a big crowd to the Princess
for the opening night. Mrs. Garnet
Carroll’s powder-blue crepes were sequin-
trimmed ; Gertrude Johnson’s royal-blue
cr£pe dinner-suit was sprinkled with
matching sequins; Mrs, Desmond Con-
nors, who was with her mother, Mrs. H.
Youlden, struck an unusual note with
her ice-blue evening-gown: the long
bodice was trimmed with matching
sequins formed into a pattern which spelt
her name, Joy. Mrs. C. V. Robertson, in
black gown and summer ermine coat,
was accompanied by her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Bob Robertson, whose deep-mauve
woollen dinner-gown was brightened by
silver sequin trimming. Also in the party
was Jacqueline Robertson, in white satin
with a cluster of deep-pink roses set at
the front of the deep neckline. Mrs. Eva
Hayes was with Mrs. Claude Flemming.
Joy Beattie’s short dinner-gown of black
crSpe was worn under a dyed-ermine
bolero. Margaret Christian, who has
just accepted a diamond and emerald
engagement ring from Leon Massoni,
wore a short black crepe frock. Kathleen
Goodall, as the Countess, wore two ex-
quisite creations; one was a turquoise-
blue chiffon negligee which was encrusted
with matching sequins, the other was a
period gown of gold satin with a hooped
skirt and drapings over the hips, trimmed
with yards of gold lace.
Grey, either for tailored coats and suits
or for accessories, was a popular choice
at Caulfield on Saturday. Mrs. Norman
Robinson, wife of the V.A.T.C. chairman,
wore a small black hat trimmed with
multi-colored satin ribbon with her grey
suit. With her grey suit Mrs. Harold
Rabling wore a small white feather toque.
Mrs. Constance Day’s hat, of grey felt,
carried yards of amber-toned veiling
looped through the crown of the hat and
then tied under the chin in a large bow.
Her tailored suit was of grey. Mrs. R.
Dunn’s grey suit featured one of the
short jackets with nipped-in waistline and
pleated skirt; her small grey hat had
red and white quills. Mrs. V. Field’s
silk frock was in pink Paisley; her up-
turned black hat was trimmed with match-
ing pink French silk ribbon. Lady Rob-
inson chose a tailored suit of navy wool
and a navy upturned felt hat banded in
white ribbon. Wyn Kellow’s suit was
worn with a tartan silk ribbon cloche
hat Sylvia Clancy’s red angora en-
semble and small white straw hat, bound
and trimmed with matching red ribbon,
made smart combination.
On the day of the Newmarket Mrs.
P. L. Coleman gave a luncheon party at
Flemington, at which The Bulletins
Nora Kelly was guest-of-honor; other
guests included Mrs. John Cain and her
daughter Joan; Mesdames Norman
Lynch, R. Josephs, C. Curtain and Maida
Voight. Other parties at which the
Sydney visitor has been feted since she
arrived in this city were given by Mrs.
Wallace Mitchell, by Lois Lathleen at
her South Yarra home, by Mr. and Mrs.
Frank O’Coilins at Frankston, the John
Kaufmans at Mt. Eliza, Madame Grace
Angelau at Olinda and by the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs, Bernard Heinze.
The Austral Salon, which has contri-
buted much to the cultural side of Mel-
bourne’s life, has decided to award a
scholarship worth £5O to the best student
of singing who wishes to take a diploma
course at the University Conservatorium ;
the first will be given this year. If Pro-
fessor Bernard Heinze recommends it,
the same student will receive £5O each
year until the diploma course has been
completed. If he decrees otherwise, the
scholarship will be awarded each year.
Mrs. J. Condie-Walker opened the
scholarship fund with a donation of £lO.
With his usual brevity H. A. Pitt intro-
duced M. Roger Loubere, Vice-Consul
for France, who opened the Max
Meldrum exhibition at Georges Gallery.
This artist always attracts a large crowd
at his exhibitions ; at this show were the
artist’s wife and daughter Ida and his
sister, Mrs. E. Hayles. Among admirers
of Max’s art noted were Mrs. Alan
Michaelis, in a blue-and-black-printed
frock, a wide-brimmed black velvet hat
and matching gloves; Peggy Thomson,
back after 11 years in England, where
she did some painting; and Kathleen
Fitzgerald, whose navy suit was worn
with a white embroidered collar and an
off-the-face navy hat trimmed with navy
and white ribbon.
Autumn foliage and flowers billowed
over the Gowrie-room at Menzies, when
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell entertained over
20 guests at a farewell luncheon-party.
given in honor of Lady Brookes and Mes-
dames Norman Martin, John Heath and
John Manby before they left for England
in the Strathaird. Mrs. Mitchell wore a
navy jacket suit and large flat beret of
navy satin which carried, broad bands of
green and red satin. Lady Brookes’s
black frock and silver-fox cape were
topped by a small hat of black velvet
trimmed with small black feathers. Mrs.
John Heath chose a smoky-blue tweed
suit anti a matching hat trimmed with two
large feather quills ; Mrs. Manby teamed
a tailored black suit and close-fitting
black hat with cocq feathers. Special
guest was Mrs. T. Hollway in black
ensemble and small black hat. Mrs. A. H.
Dennett wore a black hat trimmed with
cyclamen and powder-blue taffeta ribbon
with her black frock, which featured a
black lace yoke. Mrs. Wallace Mitchell
was assisted by her daughter, Mrs. Dudley
Gordon, whose grey-, red- and green-
checked suit was worn with a rust-toned
blouse and pheasant-feathered green
beret. Betty Cockburn’s silk frock of
shocking-pink patterned in a blue-and-
black check was worn with a blue-and-
pink taffeta hat, side-draped. Mrs.
George Haines contrasted dusty-pink
crepes with a small flower-trimmed hat.
Mrs. Norman Spry’s black frock with a
beaded net yoke was worn with an ice-
blue taffeta hat which bore black cocq
feathers. Mrs. B. J. Hattam wore a
navy jacket suit and matching flat beret;
Margaret Raitt favored the autumnal;
touch; brown frock and olive-green felt hat.
Tall, blonde and with deep brown eyes,
Simone Lavergne, who has just arrived
in Melbourne from Paris, is the represen-
tative of a leading Parisian cosmetic and
perfumery firm, and she will spend six
months touring Australian capital cities.
At a cocktail-party given in her honor
at the Australia she wore a high-necked
black crepe romaine frock, almost ankle-
length and sequin-studded, designed for
her by Carven of Paris. Simone has
appeared in French films, in one of which
Pierre Blanchar, star of the French film
“Pastoral Symphony,” was acting.
French women, says this smart Parisienne,
are more discriminating than Americans
when it comes,to “the new look.” School-
girls and dowagers in America wear new-
style frocks from morning till midnight,
but in Paris new-length frocks are evi-
dent at cocktail- and evening-parties
only. Simone also thinks we wear too
much “paint” and do not give enough
attention to skin care.
Hosts at the Matthew Lang cellars for
a tasting of the 1942 vintage of Moet
and Chandon champagne were James
Bowen Pain and’ H. Crosbie Hucks.
Guests were greeted by three pretty
French girls, decorative in national cos-
tume, .with a small tricolor bow of ribbon.
In keeping with the vintage season, the
cellars were bedecked with bunches of
grapes and vine-leaves, and to further
add to the French atmosphere there was
a mannequin parade of the latest model
hats and hosiery, all in the new vintage
shades of green, wine and bronze. Reta
Findlay organised and compered the
parade and was herself clad in wine-
toned frock and a much-veiled hat. Mrs.
Bowen Pain, recovering from a recent
illness, was not able to be present, Mrs.
Hucks, in dove-grey satin and matching
feathered hat, deputising for her as
hostess. Among the guests were Mrs.
Douglas Stephens, in black and with
touches of red on her large black hat;
Mrs. Frank Watts, whose French model
hat of pastel-blue felt trimmed with white
flowers was worn with a black jacket
suit; Mrs. M. Nicholas, in natural-straw
hat with a black velvet- crown and a
black suit; Mrs. W. Gahan, in beige lace
and with a matching lace straw hat
trimmed with a large pink rose set be-
hind each ear.
From Sydney
Lady Dill, lieut.-colonel of the British
Red Cross, who is doing a tour of Aus-
tralia, had a crowded three days in
Sydney. She arrived on Monday,
attended a party given for her by the
Governor, Lieut.-General and Mrs.
Northcott. Visits to the Lady Gowrie
Convalescent Home and to the Rehabili-
tation Farm at Menangle, a lunch with
Red Cross chiefs, Mrs. Cecil Hordern and*
Mrs. W. Minnett, and a Red Cross
council meeting filled in Tuesday and
Wednesday. Tomorrow she flies to Bris-
bane, and returns to Sydney on April 2,
the last day of the Red Cross Branch
conference, in time to give a talk to the
delegates at the Repatriation General
Hospital, Concord. The next day she
flies to England. Lady Dill is the widow
of former Chief of the Imperial General
Staff, Sir John Dill.
Congratulations to the girls selected for
the Olympic Games. This Letter wishes
them every success!
And while on the subject of
sport: One of the most active and
efficient among sporting bodies is the
All Australia Women’s Hockey Associa-
tion. Already in this the third month of
the year its plans into 1949 are rounded
off. For instance, in August about 160
hockey girls, complete with sticks (so
wolves beware!), will drop in on Sydney
from every State of the mainland, also
Tasmania. They are the participants in
the inter-State Hockey Carnival, and a
touring team. The eighth month of the
year seems a long way ahead, but the
arrangements for the visits of both teams
have been finalised; hotel accommoda-
tion, entertainments, and even the matter
of tramfares to and from Rushcutter Bay
park, where the matches will be played,
has been considered. That is why all the
hotel bookings have been made round
Potts Point and King’s Cross.
And the excitement does not fade out
with the entraining of the visitors for
home. The day after the inter-Staters and
tourers have departed the All Australia
team picked from 1947 inter-State car-
nival flies to Maoriland, where it will
challenge the girls of the Dominion from
Auckland to the South. When they are
not dovetailing tours inward and outward
to a satin-like smoothness the hockey
girls do a grand job of sending parcels
to Britain and of raising funds for the
Rachel Forster Hospital, the Pathology
Department of which they have equipped.
This is a memorial to the still-sorrowed
Mrs. F. J. Davy, and also a compli-
ment to chairman of A.A.W.H.A., Dr.
Marie Hamilton, who is head of the hos-
pital’s pathology section.
Old Sydneians are reminded that the
dance in aid of Sydney Grammar School
war memorial will be held on Tuesday
next, March 23. The bright-faced girl
pictured here by Norton Trevaire is
Rosemary Cowper, president of the
Younger Set, members of which are work-
ing hard for the success of the night.
Th-c decorations, black and gold (the
school’s colors), will be repeated in the
lucky number prize: a black puppy on
a gold satin cushion. Fifty thousand
pounds are needed for this memorial to
Old Sydneians who fell in World War 11.
It is to take the form of a new building,
to be built «n the site of the one at
present facing Stanley-street, which will
be pulled down. It will comprise
classroom, science-room and lecture-
room. Reservations, Trocadero, MA6431.
What promises to be a joyous finish to
Ladies’ Day is the dinner-dance on the
night of March 31 arranged by the
special Appeals Committee of the Sydney
Day Nursery and Nursery School. The
invitation is in booklet form, and very
appropriately gives a glimpse of the races.
On the cover are horses ready to start,
and a lady with very much the “new
look” in her ballerina skirt and high-
necked, long-sleeved bodice very fussy
below the waist, busy with her racebook.
Turning over, there are two “equally
smart” viewing through their glasses pre-
sumably the race in progress. Opposite is
the invitation proper, “Race Dance
Dinner at 7.30, cocktails 6.30.” The party
is a* the Pickwick Club, the management
of which is making no charge—the whole
evening is their donation to the fund.
Reservations: MA5421.
The George Pattersons, of Bellevue
Hill, motored up to Forbes for the wed-
ding of only son Kim to attractive
Patricia Gibson, second daughter of the
Herbert Gibsons of that district. The
wedding was picturesque. The bride wore
white satin lame brocades and a finger-
tip-length tulle veil. Jill Matthews and
the bride’s sister Barbara ’maided. Their
frocks of water-green moire were very
bouffant as to skirt; their flowers were
pale-gold gladioli. Kim’s friend Ivan
Black, M.L.A. (their friendship began
when both were p.-0.-w. in Germany) was
best man. Bob Buckland was grooms-
man. Later there were toasts at River-
sleigh, where the bride’s parents
tained about 200 guests.
Last Saturday night Madame Arrighi
was an early arrival for the new ballet
programme at the Tivoli. She wore a
frock of black marquisette and a mantilla
of fine black lace. With her came Loudon
Sainthill. The Pierre Manns were others
who arrived in time to greet friends in
the foyer. Her lupin-blue taffetas were
splashed with pink flowers; the bodice
was made with a deep fichu. Elizabeth
Northcott was escorted by Flight-Lieut.
Nash ; rhinestones sparkled on the Medici
collar of Mrs, A. Hodgkiss’s black velvet
cape and on her black chiffons. Karin
Winter and Josephine Venn were two of
the young enthusiasts. Jean Garling and
Gladys Verona were there. First-nighters
Margaret Gillespie and Dorrie Beattie
brought parties—with Mrs. P. Corney
was visitor from Holland Schan Powe,
in white. Professor Ker Stout and his
wife had their usual seats in the front
row d.-c. They had just received a letter
from daughter Judith, who is working
out her R.A.D. Scholarship at Sadlers
Wells, very thrilled over a “walking-on”
part only (the emphasis is hers) she
had had at Covent Garden in the “Sleep-
ing Princess,’ - but more thrilled at being
allowed to stand in the wings and watch
Margot Fonteyn and other topline artists
and helping with the change of costumes.
When you are footsore and weary
from “doing” the Show, look for the
kiosk with the C.W.A. sign. This is at
69 Park-road. Members of the Metro-
politan branch have undertaken to be on
duty every day (except Good Friday)
making scones and serving tea. Presi-
dent Mrs. Herring will take down the
shutters on Saturday, and she is looking
forward to doubling the takings of last
year, when the kiosk was opened for the
first time. Her one worry at the moment
is that there won’t be enough cups to
deal with the demand, despite the fact
that each of the 16 centres has donated a
dozen. The kiosk was an idea of the
late president, Mrs. Mac-Smith, and was
one of the last schemes she put into
operation. In June at the Sheep Show
Mrs. Herring hopes to be able to serve
light luncheons. Proceeds go to the upkeep
of the association’s seaside homes.
Through the humid days of Feb-
ruary and March women have been
rushing from one store to another
to see and buy, when their pockets
would admit, some of the new
winter clothes. Last week Anthony
Hordern’s Fine Arts Gallery was crowded
for each session of their Autumn Parade.
An “after-five” frock that would delight
the owner was in black velvet. This had
the usual puritan bodice that goes with
the ballerina skirt, the length of which
was exaggerated by a hem of fine black
lace. Worthy of mention, too, was a
grey-and-black ensemble. The flared
skirt in fine grey check wool had a bodice
of black velvet. An added smartness was
a short black velvet coat. Topcoats may
hang loose from the shoulders, or be
nipped in at the waist, and then flare out
into a full skirt —smart was a rich brown
boucld coat, with its swing back and its
monk’s collar, very attractive when worn
as a hood ; and equally so was a black
boucle coat, caped in Persian lamb, which
had its front cut into a deep V that ex-
tended to the waistline, the fastening a
large gold button.
The Centenary of Louisa Lawson,
which occurred recently, was not tor-
gotten. The mother of Australia’s
famous son was eulogised by speeches at
David Jones’s Blue Room. The party
was one of those crowded hours of
glorious life. It had been arranged by
the Labor Women’s Central Organising
Committee. Bertha Lawson, Henry’s
widow, gave the address of the after-
noon, and Ada Holman, whose book of
memoirs has been one of the hits of the
booksellers’ season, spoke wittily of her
association with*the poet. Mrs. R. J.
Cassidy, wife of the poet, was responsible
for this ceremony of remembrance.
Henry’s old friend and fellow-bard,
Roderic Quinn, could not be present, but
his letter to the organisers was read. It
was the delight of the afternoon.

THE SERVICE MAN
PERCIVAL v. YAMASHITA.
The Retreat to Johore.
“Ek Dum”: When the news
reached Singapore at about
5 p.m. on December 6, 1941,
that a Japanese fleet was at, sea
in the Gulf of Thailand steam-
ing westward, General Percival
ordered the Third Indian Corps
in the north to assume “first de-
gree of readiness.”
On the eastern coast of the
north, in Kelantan, probable
landing beaches had been wired
with three belts of double-apron
or triple dannert-wire. Concrete
pillboxes had been built. Large
numbers of anti-personnel and
anti-tank mines had been laid.
But the two forward battalions
had to watch a front of 30
miles. The average company
front was 8000 yards.
The Japs Land
At a quarter before midnight
that night beach-defence troops
on Badang and Sabak beaches,
of which the junction was about
\\ miles from Kota Bharu, re-
ported ships anchoring off the
coast. Before half an hour
of December 8 had gone
the first Japanese landed. There
was heavy fighting. The 3/17
Dogras defended their pillboxes
with a will, inflicting heavy
casualties on the landing parties
before they themselves were
wiped out almost to a man. The
Hudsons R.A.A.F. pressed
home their attacks on the land-
ing fleet in the face of a bitter
ack-ack defence, setting a trans-
port believed to contain tanks
and artillery on fire.
The R.A.F., based on Kedah
grounds in the west, swung over
at dawn to attack the enemy
transports which had withdrawn,
however, in the greyness of the
morning behind the Perintian
Islands.
These were the last British
attacks free from enemy inter-
ference. Singapore at 4.30 a.m.
was raided from 700 miles
away. Alor Star, Sungei Patani,
Butterworth, Penang, Kota
Bharu and Machang all began
to receive their issue by bomb
and fighter-fire. The accuracy
of Japanese high-level bombing
came as one of the most un-
pleasant surprises of the day.
Into Siam
The first moves when daylight
eame were not to retreat.
Arrangements were made at
once to advance with the tiny
forces available into Thailand.
It was hoped when orders were
issued to cross the frontier that
the Thais would at least prove
neutral. There was no such
good luck.
The 5/14 Punjabis, moving
forward, were engaged by auto-
matic posts as soon as they
crossed the border.
Meanwhile a second force —■
two companies and the carriers
of the 1/8 Punjab regiment,
with engineers and a.-t. —crossed
towards Singora, and was 10
miles beyond the frontier at
dusk at Ban Sadao. Here, at
9.30 p.m., it ran hard into a Lap
mechanised column headed by
tanks and moving in close for-
mation with headlights blazing.
The visitors had a nasty surprise.
Their two leading tanks were
quickly knocked out, but the
Punjabis were forced by superior
numbers to begin a withdrawal,
moving slowly back to escape
envelopment, breaking down
bridges as they went.
This was perfectly in line with
what was happening at Kota
Bharu.
There, as afternoon shadows
fell, it was clear that the aero-
drome could no longer be used.
All serviceable aircraft flew off.
The ground-staffs made the best
of their way to the railhead.
Neither offence nor air recce,
was possible any more in the dis-
trict. Fresh Japanese ships ap-
peared off Sabang beach and, as
the Indians withdrew in pouring
rain and pitch blackness to a
line to east of Kota Bharu,
Japanese infiltration began.
Rearward troops began to be
moved forward —28th Indian
Brigade from Ipoh and Taiping,
4/19 Hyderabads from Negri
Sembilan to Kelantan. The
battle was now ripe to begin,
the long retreat ready to be set
in motion, the Japs about to be
thwarted in their determination
to reach the Perak River in two
days and cut off the two Indian
divisions in the north.
It took the Japs 16 days to
reach the Perak, though they had
every advantage.
The Tanks Appear
The 1/14 Punjabs, retreating
in good order but hard-
pressed from the Chang-
chun position just inside
the Thai border on the western
road, had their first taste of
“the influence of armor on the
modern battlefield”:
Suddenly Without warning 12 medium
Japanese tanks followed by infantry in
lorries and other light tanks attacked
the rear of the column. Few of the
[lndian] troops had ever seen a tank
before. The tanks advanced through
the column inflicting casualties and
causing much confusion.
The blitz was temporarily
stopped when a tank was laid-
out across a bridge by a.-t. fire.
Two hundred Punjabis (with the
brigadier) who had been cut off
rejoined their comrades next
day, but the battalion had been
rendered temporarily ineffective.
Meantime the tanks, backed by
Jap infantry, had pounced again.
The losses of the weary 1/14
Punjabis in that action were
over 500; of the forward com-
panies only 20 men turned up.
Generally what was happen-
ing consisted of normal samples
of what is bound to happen in
a difficult withdrawal with inex-
perienced and imperfectly-armed
and -equipped troops, and it was
being repeated on other fronts.
On the Kroh front, where the
force had been carried forward
towards the Ledge position
after being embussed in the 2/3
Australian Reserve M.T. Coy.,
there were heavy casualties on
either side. In Kelantan, south
of the northern fighting areas,
there were fresh Japanese land-
ings. Gong Kedah and Machan
aerodromes had to be given up
without the runways being de-
stroyed.
Always it was the same story;
Fall back, defend a river line.
Meet the tanks bumbling down
the road from the rear. Clear
up the confusion. Blow-up a
bridge and get a little respite.
Fight again.
The best position for defence
on the west, “the Gurun posi-
tion,” in South Kedah, went
after a three-day stand. The
Second East Surreys and the
Argylls were badly mauled.
At the H.Q. of the Sixth
Brigade all the officers ex-
cept the brigadier were killed.
In the 11th Division all infantry
brigade commanders were
casualties and the division was
left scarcely fit for further opera-
tions.
Penang was enemy-occupied
—its only air defence was five
Buffalo fighters—after the fixed
defences had been effectively de-
stroyed and smaller arms with-
drawn ; but the radio station and
many small boats were left in-
tact for the enemy.
As the campaign began to
sort itself out it became plain
that the British-Indian forces
were facing no less than four on-
slaughts by the enemy: (1) The
drive down the west-coast road ;
(2) the drive diagonally across
the north, south - westerly
through Grik to try to reach the
Perak River and cut off all
troops north of it; (3) the drives
in the north-eastern coastal
region of the Kelantan; (4)
landings on the east and west
coasts.
By Christmas Eve there was
a specific British policy operat-
ing in the retreat, even if there
were not strict control of the
destiny of British-Indian troops.
The suggestion to send for-
ward the A.I.F. to relieve the
11th Division had been con-
sidered and rejected because it
was undesirable to break up the
A.I.F. divisional organisation or
to leave Johore, even tempor-
arily, virtually without defence.
Japanese Methods
Attempts to try to establish
defence in depth across the main
road .so soon as the Perak was
crossed in order to give the
weary troops 48 hours’ rest
failed.
The defence was faced with
an enemy who had made a
special study of bush warfare.
His forward troops sported
the mortar and the infantry gun
in preference to more cumber-
some long-range weapons. His*
snipers operated from the tops
of trees. He made unholy rows
with fireworks to rattle young
Indian troops. He used his
tanks, in the main, on roads.
But he seized every civilian bi-
cycle he came upon to use
wherever a bicycle would travel.
And he seemed to cross swamps,
rivers, jungles and other ob-
stacles with the ease of an eel.
Against these tactics it was
agreed that defence should be
echeloned in depth astride the
main arteries of communication
and that in selecting defensive
positions special regard should
be had to tank obstacles and
flank protection of holding posi-
tions by striking forces.
Disaster at the Slim
For five weeks the withdrawal
continued incessantly. Again
and again the weakening Indian
Corps met Japanese onslaughts,
always failing to hold primarily
for the same reasons as before.
The climax came when the
withdrawal had reached 330
miles and the 11th Division gave
battle on the Slim River on
January 7-8. On January 3 the
45th Indian Brigade had reached
Singapore as reinforcements. On
January 4 General Percival had
refused Major-General Bennett’s
request that, if the 111
Indian Corps fell back on
Johore, he should be allowed to
exercise operational control over
all the troops in the Sultanate.
The reasons given for the refusal
were that the fusion would lead
to command and administrative
difficulties and that the proposal
to move all the A.I.F. from
east to west Johore presented
complicated logistical problems
at such a juncture.
On January 5 a command
conference at Segamat produced
the decision to continue the fight
on the mainland as cover for the
arrival of reinforcements.
No withdrawal was to take
place beyond the Endau- (later
Mersing-) Batu Anam-Muar line.
Every effort was to be made to
deny the enemy the use of Port
Swettenham and Kuala Lumpur,
at least until January 14.
While this was going on the
12th Brigade Group of the
Indian Army was moving in the
Trolak sector and the 28th
Brigade Group into harbors
near the Slim River village,
ready to man positions for a
last stand. The poor, gallant,
in some cases half-trained,
Indians, strengthened by grim
tatters of red-eyed British regi-
ments, were now at the stage at
which no battalion could muster
more in manpower equivalent
than three poorly-armed com-
panies. No battalion had more
than two anti-tank rifles. Some
had none. The Trolak sector
of the Slim River position was
divided into three battalion sub-
sectors, two of them forward
in thick jungle—impassable for
A.F.Vs., poor for artillery sup-
port —through which the road
and railway ran in narrow cor-
ridors 400 yards apart. The road
was bombed and blasted from
the air all day, making the laying-
down of concrete a.-t. defences
possible only in darkness.
On January 5 the enemy,
attacking down the railway, was
repulsed with heavy loss. At
3.45 a.m. on January 7, in bright
moonlight, the Japs attacked
down the road, clearing the a.-t.
blocks, and pushed through 15
tanks and infantry. They roared
down the road till a tank struck
a mine. Then 30 tanks piled up
behind and seven were wiped
out. The tanks, however, broke
through after two hours. They
picked up two marching bat-
talions and cut them up badly.
Artillery units were also sur-
prised. The tanks had forced
their way two miles south of the
Slim and 15 miles from their
starting-point when a 4.5 howit-
zer of the 155th Field Regiment
held them up. They were, how-
ever, in control of the Slim
River bridge, leaving all 111
Corps’ wheeled transport on the
wrong side.
There was virtually nothing
between their spearhead and
Kuala Lumpur. Their infantry
was smart in pushing into the
gap. In the afternoon, after
bloody fighting, brigade orders
set the Indians in retreat again
for Tanjong Malim, 17 miles
away.
Remnants in Retreat
It was a hollow skeleton of a
force which fell back. The three
battalions of the 12th Brigade
could muster no more than the
equivalent of a company each
—6OO. to 700 men in all. One
battalion of the 28th Brigade
had been wiped oft the face of
the earth. The remaining two
had left less than the strength
of one. Artillery, engineers, ad-
ministrative units were equally
depleted. Many guns and
wheeled vehicles had been lost.
The 11th Division had tempor-
arily ceased to exist as an effec-
tive fighting formation.
General Percival reports:
It would be easy, but unprofitable,
to attribute the defeat to the inade-
quacy of the anti-tank defences, the
failure to blow-up bridges or to a
variety of other causes. The real
causes lay in the utter weariness of
the troops, both officers and men.
They had been fighting and moving
by day and by night for a month,
and few of them had had any proper
rest or relief. In the exhausting and
enervating climatic and topographi-
cal conditions of Malaya this is far
too long. The enemy’s troops also
no doubt suffered from local condi-
tions which were no more natural to
them than to the majority of ours.
But the enemy, with initiative con-
ferred by the offensive and by the
freedom of the sea and air, with the
ability to concentrate the whole of
their forces against portions of ours
in detail, could always relieve their
troops or ease the pace whenever they
found it necessary. Without reserves
we were able to do neither. Had we
at that time the reserve division which
had been asked for in the Third
Indian Corps area the story might
have been very different.
Field-Marshal Lord Wavell,
on his way to take over the
A.B.D.A. command, visited the
111 Indian Corps and came to
the conclusion that it “was of
little further fighting value with-
out a rest,” and that it would
“soon disappear altogether” if
its present policy of retreating in
contact with the enemy and only
when attacked were followed.
He ordered the Corps out of the
line for rest in the rear of the
A.I.F.
The Defence of Johore
General Percival ordered
Major-General Bennett to con-
centrate a brigade-group of
the A.I.F. in the Segamat area
as soon as possible, and placed
the 45th Indian Brigade Group
under A.I.F. command. The 111
Indian Corps was to retire by
rail and m.t. into Johore,
covered by rearguards at work
on “maximum demolitions.” The
9th Indian Division, on reaching
Johore, was to come under
General Bennett. Short of that
division the 111 Indian Corps
was to assume responsibility for
the defence of southern Johore
adjacent to Singapore Island.
There is some confusion here.
Field-Marshal Wavell in his dis-
patch says that he ordered a con-
centration of the whole of the
Australian Eighth Division in
north-west Johore, and remarks:
“General Percival was some-
what reluctant to do this.... In
any event, the Australian
Brigade Group remained at
Mersing.”
General Percival, however,
writes:
I have no record or recollection
of such instructions, though it was my
intention, if opportunity offered at a
later date, to relieve this brigade-
group by a newly-arrived formation.
There were now two forces
defending northern Johore —the
Westforce, under Major-General
Bennett 27th A.I.F. Brigade
Group, 45th Indian Brigade
Group, 9th. Indian Division,
2nd Battalion Loyals (less one
company), an Indian pioneer
battalion and what artillery, en-
gineer and administrative units
could be spared. This force was
to hold the Batu Anam-Muar
line.
The 111 Indian Corps, under
Lieut.-General Sir Lewis Heath,
was to consist of the 11th. Indian
Division (or its remains), the
22nd A.I.F. Brigade Group, with
attached troops, including
2/ 17th Dogras—these, under
Brigadier Taylor, A.1.F., to be
known as Eastforce. Also corps
troops, artillery, etc. These for-
mations were to defend Johore
south of the Endau-Batu Pahat
line, outside Penerang, for which
Singapore fortress was respon-
sible. The 11th Indian Division,
fiesh from the Slim, was to be
accommodated in areas in which
it could rest and refit. The
battered 12th Indian Brigade
was routed straight to Singa-
pore. The respite, however,
came too late to save the 11th
Division as a fighting formation
of use in the final battle.
After the conference of Janu-
ary 10 which decided on these
dispositions, General Percival
and his generals reconnoitred
the front.
It was decided that the cross-
ings of the Muar and Segamat
should be defended strongly as
vital lines, that focal points west
of Muar should be held to the
last by defence blocks with strik-
ing forces on their flanks. A
major ambush would be laid
west of Gemas. On the west
flank the 45th 'Brigade would
cover the coast road at Muar,
south of the river, and watch the
river and all exits south from
it in its region.
Tank-obstacles were to be
laid down as thickly as pos-
sible and forward field-guns were
to be used as a.-t. weapons.
After perilous preliminaries,
with more enemy harassing and
some losses, Kuala Lumpur had
been abandoned, the last bridge
in the Federal capital being
blown up on lanuary 11 as the
28 th Brigade Group passed
down to the Seremban area,
where the skeleton of the 12th
Brigade’s gallant remnant of 600
guarded the narrow defile of
Mantin (Setul). On the even-
ing of January 13 the final stage
of the long withdrawal started
with the perilous task of passing
the wheeled transport of the 111
Corps through the dangerous
bottleneck of Segamat—the
Muar, a broad river, had only
a ferry.
By January 14 all troops of
111 Corps were clear into Johore.
The command and responsi-
bility of the western area, upon
the'face of which the Japanese
forces were now impinging, were
handed over to Major-General
Bennett. At 8 p.m. that night Sir
Lewis Heath took over South
Johore.

GcOYgC Starkey * ** Chemotherapy the treat-
ment of infections by means of chemical remedies —is
considered one of the most modern developments of medicine.
Yet it was being practised in London nearly 300 years ago
by George Starkey, the son of an English clergyman in the
Bermudas. Starkey was educated at Harvard, Massachusetts
—then a British colony—and graduated in 1640. Coming to
London, he became an apothecary and showed great skill and
versatility in the preparation of chemical medicines such as
quinine. He won a high reputation for his “extraordinary
knowledge of chemistry," and was on familiar terms with the
leading chemists of the time.
On the outbreak of the'Great Plague in 1665, he at once set
about seeking a cure, and was reported to have compounded
a specific which was always effective. Demands for his
services were so great that he became overworked. His health
suffered, and he too fell a victim to the Plague. He gave
detailed instructions as to how his own remedy was to be
administered to him, but his physician made an error and
Starkey died, and with him the secret prescription. A con-
temporary wrote of him; “Our friend Dr. Starkey is dead of
this visitation, with about six more of them chymicall prac-
titioners the most of them distractedly madd.” The sneer
was unworthy for the “chymicall practitioners” had treated
Plague patients with complete disregard of personal danger,
even going so far as to hold post-mortems
on victims. From these crude beginnings
sprang the science of chemotherapy, which
300 years later, was to crown its many great
achievements with the development of
penicillin, the sulpha drugs and “Paludrine.”

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Brought up during the week from
Melbourne, Columnist was seen at
his best in winning the w.f.a. Raw-
son Stakes at Rosehill. Small but
select described the field, other run-
ners being Melbourne Cup-winners
Russia and Hiraji, Derby-winner
Valiant Crown, and a useful galloper
in Crusader.
Hiraji made most of the running
but showed little fight when
Columnist ranged up to him in the
straight. Columnist went on to a
comfortable win with the complete
outsider Crusader finishing strongly
to also beat Hiraji. Columnist was
ridden for the first time by Arthur
Ward, who seemed ideally suited to
him. Without being in any way
extended the winner ran the nine
furlongs in 1.51 —half a second out-
side Rogilla’s course record.
There is talk now of Columnist
contesting the Sydney Cup, for which
he has 9.7. However, there’s a
mite difference between giving Hiraji
a few pounds and a beating at w.f.a.
and conceding the same very good
animal 121 b. in a two-mile handicap.
Preconceived notions of current
two-year-old form were upset by the
result of the Macarthur Quality
Handicap, a six-furlongs affair won
by Royal Andrew (A. Mulley).
Vagabond ran a cracking good race
for second money ahead of Silverfel.
Among the unplaced brigade were
such reputed good ’uns as Breeders’
Plate-winner Riptide, Newborough,
Wattle, Grey Nurse and Dynamite.
The hard-luck case was Dynamite,
finishing fourth less than a length
behind the winner after being re-
peatedly hampered and checked.
Riptide looked of rather fullish
girth and Newborough, too, needed
the run.
Also run under Quality conditions,
the Railway Handicap of seven fur-
longs went to Heroic Sovereign (J.
Thompson), a much-improved three-
year-old son of Golden Sovereign.
With 7.10 he carried 61b. more than
bis Dontaster weight to down Victory
Lad, Beau Robert and others. Queens-
lander Jean Buzzard ran a fourth
worth noting.
Handicapping for the Three- and
Four-yeatvold Quality was made
farcical by the nomination and sub-
sequent scratching of Hiraji. He
had been given the maximum 9.5,
with the rest of the field lumped
together between 7st and Bst. With
Hiraji out, weights were bumped up
71b. all round and the winner turned
up in Shannon’s full-brother Lysander
(N. Sellwood), who carried the mini-
mum of 7.7. Most surprised person
present after the race was judge
Dudley Smith, who confidently sig-
nalled Conductor as the runner-up
and called for a photo, to decide
third; the photo, showed that Con-
ductor was third and Ozoman second.
Lysander ran the 10 furlongs in
2.6-jr; improving that time by a
quarter - second Dark Marne (J.
. Thompson) was able to win the
Rosehill Handicap from Silent and
Frescano, though there was little
between them. A couple of Mixed
Stakes over seven furlongs saw
Romany King (J. Thompson) and
Lucky Escape successful, Lucky
Escape becoming one of the very
few to have won a Mixed lumping
the maximum 9st. The nine-furlongs
Welter went to Frontal Attack (D.
Munro).
Results of races in three States on
Saturday said something for modern
transport and rather dispelled the
widely-held notion* that horses need
plenty of time to settle down after
undertaking an inter-State journey. In
Sydney Columnist won the Rawson
Stakes and in Adelaide Comic Court
won the Port Adelaide Sires’ Produce
Stakes. Both had raced at Fleming-
ton the previous Saturday. At Caul-
field the Narong Hurdle went to
Chamberlain, flown up from Tas.
the previous night.
O. R. Porter has had rather mixed
luck with his expensive purchase
Black Law, but got a bit closer to a
credit balance when the Mr. Stand-
fast horse, with J. Purtell up, pro-
duced of his best in Saturday’s St.
Kilda Handicap. The race was a
two-miler —as far as can be traced
the first flat race to have been run
over that journey at Caulfield. By
his tiptop effort in lumping 8.13 to
down Britisher, Promise You and
others, Blar*' Law enters calculations
for the Sydney Cup, which he’s in
with 8.7.
Three-year-old Chanak (W. Wil-
liamson) stamped himself class by
making hacks of a bunch of good
sprinters in the South Yarra Handi-
cap (6f.). With 9.1 he conceded
weight to all but Hindu Prince (9.7),
yet bolted home four lengths to the
good from Law List and Nestor;
he clocked 1.1 H.
Run in two divisions, the Orrong
Two-year-old saw a couple more
favorites successful. The John James
colt Mile End (H. Badger) beat Delhi
and Damon in the first leg, while the
Hellespont filly Blessing (R. Hutchin-
son) downed Parlez Vous and Amrit-
sar in the other. Pointing to the
excellence of Chanak’s winning effort.
Blessing took 1.13 i for the same
trip; Mile End took 1.12 J.
Supporters of the 12-to-l chance
Ironheart (S. Ralph) in the Kooyong
Welter could reckon themselves lucky
to collect; the Kinderscout horse
"ShadoW-sparrin', are y'? Well, Watch out the shadow
don't hit back!"
had to survive the camera and two
protests. The camera showed some-
thing very close to a triple deadbeat
with Ironheart a half-head clear of
Edward John and Tamerlane, who
did deadheat, and riders of both
threw in protests which were dis-
missed. The Gordon Steeple gave
cross-country rider R. Hayes a nice
double when he landed Wangaratta
into first place.

Leading Melbourne trainer Theo
Lewis, owner J. Pierce and appren-
tice rider C. Winslett had no luck
in their appeal against a 12-months’
disqualification over the running of
the horse Better Days—a bit of a
misnomer—at Werribee.

A search through old Bulletin files
brought to light the following, which
appeared on this page in May, 1900:
Dave Strickland, who came across
from Menzies, W.A., at Easter, to
compete in two foot-races —Stawell
Easter Gift and the Eight-Hours’
Sheffield Handicap—cantered home a
winner in both events. His only per-
formance hitherto was the annexation
of a £l5 handicap in W.A. three
years ago, and it was but natural
that the best peds. in Australia, whom
he met at Stawell, in their anticipa-
tory tips, gave him no mention. When,
however, the lanky, 13st., fair-haired,
modest youth of 22 won his several
heats, almost every other man left
in the final accused him of “cronk”
performances, threatened to have his
scalp, and declared that, if he won,
they’d have him “rubbed out.” On
the following day, however, when
the final was run, these same accusers
had the nerve to approach him and
say “Save a tenner with you, Strick-
land?” “No, thanks,” was the reply;
“I’ll have the whole hog or nothing!”
He is now sitting back waiting to
collect the whole hog.
Some 24 years later the “lanky,
fair-haired, modest youth” became the
father of a baby girl, and, skipping
another quarter-century to the present
day, Shirley Strickland, with world-
record time to her credit, is the
number-one selection for Australia’s
Olympic team.

The 130-yards Bendigo Thousand
was won by 21-year-old medical
student John Stoney—a remarkable
comeback by the ex-schoolboy cham-
pion who broke a leg at football last
year and seemed unlikely to do any
further serious running. Stoney won
by two feet from P. McKeown in
11 7-10 sec. and collected £BOO for his
effort.
Rowed on the Iron Cove (N.S.W.)
course on Saturday, the annual J. B.
Sharpe Memorial Regatta saw Syd-
ney G.P.S. crews, as usual, more than
holding their own with the older club
rowers. A smooth-looking com-
bination from Newington licked
Haberfield in the Memorial Eights
and St. Josephs downed Grammar in
the Maiden Eights. Sydney High
entered its first, second and third
crews in the Novice Fours, and they
finished in that order in the final.

Passed on suddenly in Sydney, J.
Vindin, who in his active rowing days
was a member (No. 4) of Mosman
Club’s champion eight which swept
the rivers in the late ’twenties. Sent
over to represent N.S.W., the eight
won the King’s Cup at Perth in 1929.

Final totting-up of Sheffield Shield
percentages for 1947-48 gave Wes-
tralia 65 points, N.S.W. 57, S. Aus.
43, Queensland 40, and Vic. 34.3.
The baby heroically kicked the bottom
out of the cradle in its first year
of rep. cricket.

An inspired burst of bowling by
I. Clay for Tasmania put some
sparkle into the second Australian XI
match at Launceston. With his figures
none for 28 after the first day’s play,
he then struck form to wind up with
five fo,r 63, among the victims Barnes,
Hassett and Loxton. For the tourists
Toshack took six for 55 and McCool
four for 91. Australia won by an
innings and 49 runs.
Moving on a step, the tourists
struck stiffer opposition in Perth,
where at stumps on Saturday the
Westralian XI was still holding the
fort with 289 on the board for a
loss of eight wickets. Spin bowlers
McCool,, Toshack and lan Johnson
took a hiding; the Westralians’ top
scorer was left-hander W. Langdon
with 112.

The Wallabies closed their tour in
Canada by defeating Vancouver All
Stars (36-3) and British Columbia
(20-6). In these matches Arthur
Tonkin kicked three penalty goals,
converted seven tries, and scored one
try.

At Sydney Stadium brother Clem
of the Sands quartet tackled Cale-
donia’s Billy McLean over 12 rounds.
Apart from a dull opening round it
was a crowd-pleaser slather and
whack, with both boys on the canvas
more than once and Sands eventually
getting a narrow points decision; a
draw would have been more popular
and not unjustified. In the other
12-rounder featherweight Billy Wat-
son outpointed Russ Woods.

Representing another battling
brotherhood, Rex Murphy (list.), of
Murphy, Burns and Murphy, met Em
Jarvis on level terms at Leichhardt.
The scrap was good; the decision, a
draw, was not, and the crowd roared
its disapproval—not that that’s any
criterion. With Murphy doing little
leading Jarvis piled up points over
the first six rouhds and dropped Rex
for a six count in the seventh. Too
late to make up lost ground, Murph.
fought back fiercely for the remainder.

At Melbourne Stadium Australian
featherweight champion Eddie Miller
(9.1£) and Vic. titleholder Frank
Flannery (9.3) turned on a particu-
larly willing scrap till the tenth round.
It was called off when Flannery
damaged his dook and couldn’t con-
tinue.


ABORIGINALITIES
“UNTO THE HILLS.”
“I will lift up,” the Psalmist sings,
“Mine eyes, mine eyes unto the hills”;
My soul, athirst for ghostly thrills.
Towards the high mountains spread her wings—•
In those bare heights she moved alone
And found, she thought, in wastes of stone
And the chill torrents from the snows
And the dark crags the eagle knows
And the rough knuckles of great peaks,
The ultimate secrets mankind seeks;
But then, woe’s me, a mere machine
Took me above the fields of snow
Leaving the mountain far below
Till earth herself was hardly seen:
Majestic heights, I was to find,
Are but the wrinkles on our rind.
m.l. Arnold Wall.

“Trade Wind”: The South Seas are
smiling again. Travelling recently from
Bali to Tahiti, we found the tropic’s
fecund growth has healed war’s scars, and
preparations are everywhere in hand to
receive the post-war tourist. In Bali the
famous Kris dancers of the Temple of
Kali have shed their first sacrificial blood
since the war; at Samarai a 10,000-ton
liner was moored; and in Noumea the
French Government plans to build a
casino to attract tourists. The average
South Sea visitor on tour thinks first of
Tahiti. Natives in American-held islands
have acquired new economic concepts
and a keener appreciation of money. But
Tahiti was never a base, and retains the
simplicity which used to be the greatest
charm of island life. There is a pleasant
hotel there, serving steak every day if
you wanted it, and a joint of beef or
mutton for dinner —plus iced oranges,
bananas, papaws, mangoes and melons.
Cost was £l2 per month. Only catch is
a permit from the Governor is required,
and few will be issued until the island is
ready.

“Bo”; The floodwaters which swirled
through Little Backwater had isolated
Josh Pickering’s holding. With torrential
rain adding hourly to the rising waters
and making tenure of even the highest
portion of his ground a dangerous im-
probability, a rescuing boat had come to
take the middle-aged bachelor to safety.
As Joe Wales, the postmaster, levered the
boat in with a long stripped sapling to
where the water lapped the high ground,
Josh sang out “I won’t be a m 0.,” and,
with a length of stout rope in his hand,
hurried up the gentle boulder-strewn
slope, his eyes glued to the ground in
obvious and keen search. In a minute or so
he reappeared. One end of the rope was
tied around his waist, the other end was
around a hefty boulder, under the weight
of which he was staggering as he made
his way down to the rowing-boat. “What
the hell are you taking that along with
you for, Josh?” asked Joe, “We won’t
be needing an anchor.” “Anchor be
damned!” panted Josh. “It’s all right
for you coves that can swim, but I can’t
do a stroke. If the boat tips over I can
hold on to this gibber an’ walk along the
bottom until I can stand on it with me
head above water, like the blokes I’ve
read of sometimes in The Bulleteen.”

“Goldie”: McClinchey, Newchum and
I were sinking a duffer at Skeleton Creek,
the shaft down about 40ft. with a drive
off one end. We bored out the face and
Newchum went below to help Mc-
Clinchey load the holes, while I shar-
pened a few drills at the forge. He was
back, whitefaced, in a couple of minutes.
“What’s wrong?” I asked. “Aw, that Mc-
Clinchey,” said Newchum. “He’s rammin’
the gelignite an’ stuff with one o’ the
steels. Shouldn’t he be usin’ a wooden
tamp?” “Yair, I s’pose he ought to,” I
reflected. “Were you scared of being
blown up?” “Well, it weren’t that
exackly,” Newchum said. “But y’ know
how the old cove ain’t too fond o’ washin’
hisself. Gripes, I got thinkin’ how things’d
be if he jarred that fracture, an’ I jist
didn’t like the idea o’ stayin’ there on the
chance o’ being splashed with bits o’ Mc-
Clinchey.”

“Gravelsnatcher”; I’ll accept “Nor’-
West’s” explanation of frogs and fish
found-after a downpour (B. 18/2/’4B),
although it’s got me tricked how they can
survive a passage through a cyclone and
the subsequent drop to earth. A force
which is “strong enough to uproot a tree
and delicate enough to tear a butterfly
wing from wing”—Stacpoole’s descrip-
tion of a cyclone—might deal harshly
with a frog’s internal economy. But I
can’t afford to be sceptical. Once at
Reedys (W.A.) I watched a couple of
dogs attempting to heel a willy-willy that
had paused in the middle of the town.
It moved off unexpectedly and took those
dogs in its stride. They were 50ft. up
and still climbing when last seen. That
willy-willy may have travelled miles be-
fore it spent itself and deposited its bur-
den in at least a half-hearted attempt to
prove that it really can rain as hard as
they say.
« * ♦ «
“Bon-Yi”: For toughness of hide I
commend the seeds of scrub-wattles and
inkweed. Cleared scrub is left to dry and
fired on a suitable day; the blaze has to
be seen to be believed for its fierceness,
and the white-hot coals from blazing
ironbark logs fuse the soil into clinker,
yet within a month or two, following rain,
these übiquitous pests are sprouting all
over the burn. Inkweed seems to flourish
where the flames have been hottest, and
magnificent specimens are sprouting long
before the stumps and roots of the trees
send up suckers.
* * * *
“Canine”: What an animal really sees
when he looks at something will always
be a matter for theorising. Because of
his eye-structure it has long been
claimed that a horse sees man as a giant
and thus goes quietly ; monkeys, with the
sorrow they have sometimes shown when
confronted with a mirror, apparently
have vision acute enough to measure up
their beauty. Some dogs, however, grey-
hounds and gun-breeds especially, have
proved that they are almost human as
far as eyesight goes, and I know a
spaniel of the very keen-eyed “Springer”
breed who obviously saw exactly as his
master did. Tacked on to the verandah
wall of the owner’s house was a large
“More puddin up the other end, Jim .”
calendar showing a colored picture of a
puppy and a baby. When a breeze lifted
the calendar it caught the dog’s eye ; he
stared at it for a moment and then
started barking furiously, as he does when
another dog comes' too near the house.
The owner saw that the calendar was
worrying him and lifted it down to give
him a closer look. Ignoring the baby in
the picture, the dog went through the
usual sniffing drill on the depicted dog,
finally sitting back puzzled and howling
like a fire-engine. The owner then set
the calendar flat on the floor, destroying
any illusions the dog may have had
about it, and after a while hung it up
again. He claims that the spaniel now
only looks that way When he wants to
know the date.

“Old-timer”: With two quiet draughts
pulling the dray tandem-fashion. Pocket-
knife and Little Curl were carting chaff
from Tammit to Prill. The dray had a
hay frame on it and the load was pretty
high. Little Curl and P, were perched
on top, the horses plodding steadily
along the winding bush track, and Pocket-
knife lay back, hat over his eyes, and
dozed. Presently he stirred and spoke.
No answer. He pushed his hat back.
Little Curl wasn’t there. Pocket-knife
looked down at the horses, which plodded
steadily on, and saw the reins trailing.
He scrambled down, got the reins and
pulled them up. He looked all around
and yelled. No Little Curl. Pocket-
knife examined dray wheels and fitments
for signs of skin and hair. There were
none. He tied the team to a tree and
set off back along the track. Two miles
back Little Curl hung, suspended by a
dead stick through the seat of his pants,
to an overhanging box-limb 15ft. above
the road. “You’re always doin’ somethin’
silly,” said Pocket-knife, “It took you
a ruddy long time to wake up,” snorted
Little Curl. He was pretty wild ; Pocket-
knife was highly amused. Then it dawned
on P. that he’d have to walk two miles
to get the team in order to reach Little
Curl, and it was his turn to become wild.

“Lim-Limbu” (N.G.): Reference was
made in a recent issue to a New Guinea
timber “light as balsa wood.” The refer-
ence could be to either of two timbers:
(1) Ilimo or Erema (Octomeles
Sumatrand) which weighs 231 b. per cubic
foot, and is plentiful up to 1000 ft. eleva-
tion and in diminishing quantities up to
3000 ft.; and (2) the kapok-tree (Bombax
malabaricum ), weight 16-231 b. per cu. ft.,
a coastal-dweller. Both are millable
timbers, the former averaging a yield of
5000 super, ft. per tree. But both timbers
have one serious fault —they are struc-
turally weak.

“Flip”; When he made his quarterly
shopping trip from Crow Bend —75 miles
as the locals fly—Bert Harrison always
passed by the store at Bogulla, nearly 20
miles closer to him, “because back there
the shop’s too flamin’ modern and they
look at y’ like y’ need a bath.” Shortly
after Bombina’s store changed hands,
Bert turned up with his pointer dog,
entered the shop, and withio. a few
minutes was out again, bewildered at
what the new management had done to
it, at the array of glass and plastics, the
fluorescent lighting, the ever-playing
radio, and the spider-web of gleaming
wires above it all which hummed as the
changercarriers shot back and forth.
“Great outfit runnin’ it now,” he told us.
“Towser here spotted them flyin’-foxes
they’ve got slidin’ about in the air and
starts pointin’ at one. Then the counter-
jumper don’t look where he’s goin’ and
sprawls over him with an armful of
eggs. Towser bites him, and the bloke and
owner threaten to have the law on us.
Then Towser starts goin’ a reflection of
himself in a shiny counter, wimmem
scream, and I knock over a saucepan-
stand with me flamin’ elbow. I’m so
blasted dumflummoxed I forgets me
order. I has to get out quick before I does
me block properly, so I buys one of these.
‘Toothbrush,’ says the bloke writin’ out
me' docket, ‘one and ninepence.’ Now
that’s how these modern joints get y’—
me, what hasn’t had no teeth to brush
for 40 years! But with a couple of fly-
hooks in the bristles I might get me
money’s worth at that. I’ll do me
shoppin’ at Bogulla on the way back—old
as the flamin’ hills compared with here.
C’morn, Towser.”

“H.”: We were grouped outside
the huts when the rabbiter, accompanied
by a score of ill-bred dogs, passed a fur-
long or so westward of the homestead
and one of his mongs loped up to in-
vestigate a bit. It bowled all the station
dogs into the dust, almost tore an ear off
Big Joe’s red kelpie, and so terrorised
the station’s pet Peke that the thing
jumped into a pond devoted to goldfish
and waterlilies. Big Joe got his gun and
let fly ; the rabbiter’s dog turned three
somersaults and streaked away yowling
blue murder. The rabbiter’s van
stopped; a hefty bloke came lumbering
towards us. “Who shot me dawg?” he
said, glaring at each of us in turn. “I
did,” said Big Joe. “What about it?”
The rabbiter wasted no time in parley,
but straightaway sailed into the, big bloke.
Nothing loath, Big Joe came into action
with a bang. Thereupon three dogs
leaped at him and almost disrobed him.
“Keep ’em orf while I settle this
blankard,” howled the big fellow.
and he swung a haymaker to the
rabbiter’s chin that put him in dream-
land for five minutes. Slowly, the bunny-
collector got to his feet. “Y* ought never
be crool to a dumb animal,” he mumbled.
“Well, strike me pink,” Big Joe snorted,
“You hit me first, didn’t y’?”

“Mat’s Mate”; We were roosting on
a post-and-rail fence between Pakenham
and Koo-wee-rup (Vic.) when a little
Italian with a pitchfork appeared and
began forking sheaves of oaten hay on to
a spring-cart. Sighting us he came over
and said “You wanta the jawb?” “What
you payin’?” Mat asked. “Ten sheeling
the day.” Mat got down, took the pitch
fork, jabbed it into four heavy sheaves
and threw them 30ft. away. The Italian’s
eyes popped. “You wouldn’t,” said Mat
gently, “have the hide to offer blokes
like us a lousy half-nicker a day.” The
Italian got his breath back. “Non, non,’
he squeaked. “Da pounda. I pay da
pounda fora da strong mans.” “An
tucker?” “Yes, da food, she is with
heem.” “Aussie tucker, none of y’ salad
oil an’ cabbage tack?” He thought hard
then beamed. “Ess, ess, da meat anda
potate anda” he beamed some more
and ended with a Mediterranean gesture
of grandeur—“anda tomart sauce, too!’
We took the job.

“Lower Tops’l”; Mention of Osca
Larsen, the survivor of the Brier Holme
who roamed for 100 days on Tassie’s
wild West Coast while rescue partie
combed the area firing the bush and ex
ploding guns (B. 4/2/’4B), recalls that he
owed his life not only to the genera
cargo washed up from the wreck, but also
to the fact he had a premonition he would
be saved. Strangely enough, Larsen
never thought of searchers, nor they of the
possibility of survivors; consequently
neither left notes or signs. Larsen signed
on again in Hobart before the mast. Two
years later in London he agreed" to join
the Swedish barque Alphild, but he failec
to turn up at the shipping office next
morning. Since the Alphild on that voyage
was lost in the same bay as the Brier
Holme went —and with no general cargo
for the survivors to exist on —one
wonders if this Norwegian shellback had
another premonition. Never heard
Larsen’s ultimate fate. He could still be
living—he would be 69.

“Chuck”: Dad’s arms sprawled on the
table, and his eyes strayed idly to the win-
dow while he waited for Mum to dish out
the spuds and pumpkin. Suddenly he came
to life. “Shove mine in the oven. Mum,”
he yelled, making for the door. “Dave,
give us a hand, will y’? It’s that cat.”
There was a hurried clatter of scraping
chairs and blundering feet, and Mum
dropped the pots in her anxiety for her
pet. “Dad, Dad,” she wailed, following
him out the door, “Tabby’s only caught
his dinner. He won’t let it go in your
garden, honest he won’t.” Dad waved
her aside. “Behind that bush there, Dave.
Here, puss, puss, nice puss, come on . . .
aw, blast the thing. Grab him, Dave.”
In the doorway Mum wasted a few
minutes in unheeded pleading before re-
turning to rescue the burning spuds.
Presently Dad came in. “Gripes, Mum,”
he beamed, “wouldn’t mind y’ havin’ a
couple more like that tabby while the
price o’ skins keeps up. That’s the third
rabbit he’s brung home this week.”

“Troppo”: Down for a spell in the
Big Smoke, I’ve been weather-bound in
a third-rate pub, gaining my only recrea-
tion from occasional sallies along the
streets in search of something interesting
in the shop-windows. Yesterday, by gosh,
I found it. Among the jewellery in a
curio-place was a lethal little novelty with
complete directions for a successful
fatality. Looking like a splinter of
chock’s leg-bone with a feather or two
intact, it bore a notice:
This death-pointing bone is one of the
genuine articles used widely by the Arunta
tribe it is pointed at the victim at the
end of one’s extended arm strangely
enough an accumulation of evidence shows
that death does seem to follow within two
or three days. A bargain at ss.

“Gravelsnatcher”; Bill the Goose had
gone to Perth for a few days, and his
mate, Rabbit Jenkins, hung around the
Bumpercrop pub drinking without
enthusiasm and gloomily predicting the
dissolution of their partnership. He
brightened when the Goose came back
with his bride, and he saw that she was a
sensible girl who could be relied on to
live quietly at the hotel and not interfere
with their trapping. Unfortunately, in
his gloom he had forgotten the Goose’s
instructions to book a room, and there
wasn’t a double-room available. Bung
suggested a two-bed room. Bill inspected
the small room with the two single beds
and nodded glumly. “I s’pose it’ll have
t’ do, Lil,” he agreed reluctantly. “But
I did think we’d ’a’ had a room to our-
selves.”


“Reckon I'll soon be hittin' the track: I'm gettinitchy feet.”
“Esk D.”: The road to Nosmoke is
long, hot and dusty. On the burning
plains mirages shimmer, dance and mock
the thirsty traveller, who takes some
small consolation in thoughts of the pub
at his journey’s end. The road is at the
moment solely occupied by a swaggie,
unremarkable except that he is wearing
overcoat, scarf and gumboots, slowly
heading in the direction of the village.
On the verandah of its most imposing
edifice he pauses and gazes longingly in-
side. Grim-visaged, Bung scowls at him.
“ ’Qt,” remarks the traveller. Bung
grunts. ' “ ’Otter than yestiddy,” comes
the next hope-filled bit of information.
Pause. Then, wearily, as there is no
answer, “-’Otter still t’morrer.” Bung is
drowsy with the heat and his wares, and
it is only then that the odd appearance
of the stranger registers in his mental pro-
cesses. “Look,” he says earnestly.
“Whyinell don’t y’ peel orf some o’ that
clpbber if y’re so ’ot?” The nomad fixes
him with a contemptuous gaze. “Ar, y’re
jist like the rest of ’em,” he says. “Y’
haven’t learnt the first principles o’ re-
frigeration. A bloke’s got t’ git up a
decent sweat before he c’n git cool.”

“0.K.”: The missus, demanding
poultry for the Sunday roast, puts the
axe in my hand and tells me to get on
with it. After an hour or so’s hard
exercise I have my hoof on the neck of
No. 2 while I remove the headpiece of
No, 1 and toss him aside to get going
on the next bloke. The leaps and kicks
of the dying warrior attract the current
boss of the fowlyard, and he sails in for
a fight; after a few passes the antics of
his opponent see him baffled but still
game ; then a last mad leap from the
headless one brings it fair down on our
hero’s back, and with a squawk that sets
all his wives a-cackle he lights out for
the shed. He’s no good for anything
these days, and next occasion for a cele-
bration his number will be up.
“Macnell”: Bali, “the island where the
angels fly low,” suffered little under Jap
occupation. Perhaps the Americans are
more to blame. The garish touch of
Western modernity intrudes everywhere
in towns and villages along the coast.
The natives’ beds in this paradise are of
brass-fitted iron; their village huts are
fenced with flattened petrol-tins, rusty
in the monsoonal heat; instead of
the exquisitely-carved pottery and
wooden vessels of old Bali crafts-
manship there are enamel jugs and
porcelain water-coolers from visiting
American warships ; and above each bed,
around the walls of each room, even
depending on copper-jvire from verandah
roofs, hang suggestive pictures of Ameri-
can film-stars. But the taint reaches only
along the coast. Inland, among the hills
and volcanoes and incredibly beautiful
crater lakes Bah is still as it always was
—a dream island jewelled in a turquoise
sea, the epitome of all a South Sea island
is supposed by romanticists to be.

“Conda”: I watched the ship’s funnel-
smoke. Once in the air the roiling
column lazily dispersed. One wisp
dropped, swirled a moment, floated up-
ward, then surged in a swift spiral high
above the masts. Apparently a simple
natural force, this everyday occurrence
was of immense significance: it demon-
strated that not only do winds blow
from north, south, east and west, but
straight up. These updrafts, zephyrs at
ground-level, milesi in the sky swell into
terrific blasts of air that cause thunder-
storms, and which are of such force they
can hold suspended egg-sized hailstones.
A hailstone is like an onion—overlaid
with successive layers of frozen water.
Miles above the earth water-vapor is
frozen in an updraft, and the particle
of ice tossed up and down like a ping-
pong ball on a nozzle of water, until it
is coated to the size we know. The force
necessary to carry an object as big as a
hailstone upward is a wind of 200 miles
an hour—straight up. That is the dyna-
mite packed in that little puff that lifted
the funnel-smoke above the masts.

“Emjai”: The woodchop at the up-
country show brought a good entry of
locals, to whom Miley, then in his prime,
was conceding a long start. Dinny
Hogan’s boy was in it, and Dinny and
his wife were there to see fair play. The
limit men were under way, and Miley
sat on his Jog while the other starting-
marks were being called. Said Dinny to
his wife: “That’d be Miley, the cham-
peen. He’d be winnin’ the chop, I’m
thinkin’.” “An’ why wouldn’t he?” re-
torted Mrs. H. indignantly. “The great
lazy loafer, sittin’ there restin’ while our
boy’d be tirin’ himself choppin’.”

“Shamuseen”; The diminishing stature
of present-day Torres Straits Island
bucks in comparison with his own nearly
7ft. physique was attributed by Panieulu,
a Badu village headman, t 6 the curtail-
ment, through missionary activity, of the
ancient practice of growing boys helping
themselves at the maternal bowser —he
said weaning generally did not take place
till the offspring reached puberty. I
personally recollect seeing two binghi
youngsters slug it out toe-to-toe in a dis-
pute over priority at the source of sup-
ply, whilst the matron smoked and
gabbled unconcernedly on, in utter in-
difference to her warring offspring.

“Curate’s Egg”; When his clientele
drifted almost in entirety to the rival
Mulgaville Arms because of the attrac-
tions of the new barmaid from Brisbane,
Hogan countered by advertising a fishing
competition to be held at the Shearers’
Rest. Out of curiosity, begotten of the
knowledge that the nearest watercourse
to Hogan’s pub had not been more than
ankle-deep for six months, the crowd
rolled up on Saturday afternoon. But
Hogan delivered the goods. Entrants,
with 18in. rods, foot-long cotton lines and
flyhooks, sat on the verandah of the
pub and fished in the horse-trough, which
had been stocked by the Hogan offspring
with hundreds of tiny “bobbies,” netted
in the almost-dry creek.

“M. Alison”: There will no doubt pass
through those he-men of the Council
whose brewed tea could, when cold,
be used for filling fountain-pens a
shudder of pure horror to leam that
quartpo t-boiling competitions (B.
18/2/’4B) are now the prerogative of Girl
Guides—at least they were right up to
the war years—at Clunes (Vic.), where the
divisional commissioner, Mrs. Troup, of
Tourello, has handed on the old bush
tradition. Fire had to be built and lit,
billy boiled, tea made and carried across
a strip of rough ground to be presented
to the grand old lady herself. To com-
plete the race, the fires had to be pro-
perly extinguished and all traces re-
moved from the gravel-patch on which
they were built.

“Alpine Willie”: Trappers in Victoria
aren’t likely to throw up their fids at the
proclamation on rabbit destruction from
February 18. Skins are probably at their
worst for the year, and if inspectors are
on the job, as expected, the regular trap-
ping season from May on is likely to be
far below average. I don’t know whether
officialdom has taken into account the
dollar position. Bunny has been earning
a considerable amount of Uncle Sam’s
money lately, and a stay of proceedings
till May would have meant a bumper
crop of well-furred skins.
* * * *
“Jemac”; Though little is heard of the
world’s first weather-fleet —one ship
rescued the crew of a grounded steamer
off Cornwall recently—they are doing an
invaluable job. Based on Boston, their
mission is to drift or steam over an area
about 10 sq. miles in extent, providing
a “fix” or navigational check for passing
aircraft; compiling weather reports and
hydrographic observations ; rescuing air-
men forced down at sea; and reporting
hazards to navigation. Not all the
weather-ships are concentrated in tropic
belts. Each year the International Ice
Observation and Ice Patrol Service begins
its patrol in March and continues till
June. These weather-men will be on the
lookout for a yellowish-white light re-
flected on to the sea near the horizon.
This means ice. The idea of an inter-
national weather-fleet was mooted just
before the recent war ; the operation of its
21 ships is a step which the present-day
air age and lengthening of international
communications urgently requires.
* * * *
“Bendigo”: After breakfast we
assembled to get the day’s orders from
the overseer, and Snuffler was instructed
to take the new double iron gates over
to the river gate and rig them. The hand
found the swinging of them a ticklish
job, and after several unsuccessful
attempts he “did his block” and threw
the gates over the fence into the river
and departed to spend the rest of the day
on his back in the hut. That evening
the overseer, receiving reports on the
day’s work, inquired of Snuffler whether
he had hung the gates. “No,” said
Snuffler wearily. “Hangin’ was too good
for them blankards —I drowned ’em in-
stead ! ”
* * * *
“Wippegong”; Could never see why we
should be so touchy over Gordon’s refer-
ence to this land as one “where bright
blossoms are scentless. And songless bright
birds.” Most of our brightest birds are
songless. The most brilliant family, the
parrots, are a tribe of screechers, despite
the few soft notes of some of the rosellas.
Our gorgeous fruit-pigeons mumble among
themselves —possibly their mouths are
full—and the flashing coastal bowerbirds
approach melody only when they’re
mimicking. Rainbow-birds, crimson and
“I told you your jaloppy was no bulldozer, missus!”
orange chats and some of the finches are
a joy to the eye, yet they can muster but
a few wheezes and chirps between them.
Still, none of that matters, for what
Gordon didn’t mention —perhaps didn’t
know —is that among our more quietly-
plumaged fowl are some of the world’s
best songsters. With voices like theirs,
what need have the maggie, the butcher-
bird or the grey thrush to envy the avian
examples of gilded glamor? The song-
larks can brighten the day out on the
grasslands as the grey fanny and white-
throated warbler —native canary if you
prefer it —dp in the scrub; and there’s
never a vivid feather in the bunch. Even
the humble silver-eye is a singer of worth
for his weight, while at the other end the
lyrebird, the only mimic to improve on
the tone of his models and an artist in
his own right, is about as decorative as
a bucket of soot. So what’s it matter?
There are birds you are content to gaze
at and there are others you’d rather
listen to as well. Did I say “birds”?
* * * *
“Waarom”: A proposition doesn’t
necessarily have to be verbalised to be
stated. Two orangs at the Melbourne
Zoo were removed while director Roger’s
son, an artist, provided their cage with
a backcloth depicting a vista of the
Sumatran jungle with a durian tree
(whose delicious but evil-smelling fruit is
beloved of the simians) covered with ripe
fruit. When the orangs were readmitted
one of them ran round as if demented,
while the other climbed a swing, threw
himself at the tree and crashed his face
against the brick wall on which it was
painted. Not satisfied with this demon-
stration, his companion first stood on
her head, after the fashion of the old
Japanese masters who, when they wanted
to divest themselves of their associa-
tional prejudices, looked between their
legs at the landscape, and then tried to
climb the tree. Both then sat down and
said more plainly than words could:
“The moderns are quite right when they
say that it isn’t art to make a thing look
like Nature.”
* * * *
“Billy T.”: Jimmie Ah Foong always
brought his baskets round to the back,
delivered our vegetables, took the order
for next time and waddled off; but if you
ever bothered to notice it he seemed to
take longer going out than he did to come
in. We never knew why until we were
pruning the big hydrangea and came
across neat columns of mystic characters
on the wash-house wall —Jimmie’s record
of our account. Nothing was said, and
for all we knew ours was the only house
upon which was inscribed the debits and
credits of its occupants until Smithers
suddenly decided to clip his hedge and
paint his fence. He was on the last panel
when Ah Foong hove round the corner,
and with a yelp of anguish there broke
a storm of Oriental grief that left
Smithers dumb. How was he to know
that he’d painted out about 10 pages of
Jimmie’s ledger?
« * * «
“E.K.”; There has been much dis-
cussion lately as to what an eagle can
and can’t do when caught in a rabbit-
trap, but not much as to the best way to
get him into it. My nomination is a
white fowl in a small wire-netting cage,
with half a dozen rabbit-traps set round
it and wired to the corner-posts, the
whole set in as exposed a position as
possible (a scalded plain is ideal). An
eagle can spot that white dot from miles
off, and, after alighting near the cage,
will prowl around trying to get in until,
sooner or later, it puts a foot in one of
the traps.
* * * *
“Zake”: A hoe I wielded severed a
bulldog-ant somewhere near the midriff.
The hind part immediately recalled an
appointment it had in a general northerly
direction and made haltingly off. A pair-
of still nicely-functioning legs carried the
fore-end the opposite way. A little later
I came on the head-end sparring up
aggressively to the nether portion. Per-
haps the slight accident had rendered its
eyesight a bit unsure and it had mistaken
its other half for a fellow bull-ant out
after a stoush. Of course I could have
been mistaken —it might merely have
been sidling up in a matey way in the
hope of getting together again. They
still hadn’t made up their minds what to,
do when 1 left.
THE WHITE FIREPLACE.
There stood the whitewashed fireplace,
The kettle on the chain,
Of fallen coals not e’en a trace —
They’d been swept up again;
The bricks all freshly done with white,
The hearth as clean as snow,
The crossbars, too, and in the light
The coals a brighter glow.
There sang the kettle’s old black spout
As it blew clouds of steam
The while the log puts ants to rout
And sap frothed from each seam;
And with the dirty chimney black
—-After thcre’d been some rain—
That everlasting cry come back:
“The soot’s come down again!”
Though things were left undone outdoors,
Unfinished many a job,
Or dust, maybe, lay on the floors,
Still glowed the hearth and hob;
What mattered if ’twere weal or woe,
That things were wrong or right?
The fireplace still had to glow
A spotless, snowy white.
And though men dared the fire and drought
And fought the storm and flood;
Though brave their hearts when fate would
clout
And quick and hot their blood,
They dared not put their clayey boots
In crude and foul disgrace
On hob or hearth and spoil, the brutes,
That whitewashed fireplace.

THE WAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Doing Weil.
“Pat O’Day”: One man is
doing it on the N.S.W. south-
west slopes near Gundagai,
where the annual rainfall is 26in.,
the elevation 700 ft. and the land
is good fine-wool country. He
makes his 3000-acre area yield
him £1 per acre per year. Ad-
mittedly he saves household ex-
penses by growing his own veget-
ables, mutton and pork, but
there’s no reason why others
shouldn’t do the same.
There is a valuable sideline
in turkeys. Saffron thistle, which
most people do nothing about
except curse, isi abundant
enough to provide half the feed
for the turkeys. A hundred-
head of them made £2OO last
year. He runs 2000 medium- to
fine-wool Merinos, and saves on
wool-carting, sheep-carrying and
other transport items by using
his own motor-truck. His
country runs a sheep to the acre,
so he is able to carry an addi-
tional 300 crossbred ewes which,
joined to. Southdown rams, give
him high-priced lambs for
September sale and good mutton
for homestead use.
He also manages to run 50
stud Merino ewes and grow 100
acres of oats for winter fodder,
using them as hay or grain as the
season demands. Thus, though
woolgrowing is his main acti-
vity, he collects a nice little
cheque on the side and isn’t
worked to death doing it.
High Cost of Lime.
Southern Limestone Products,
Moss Vale (N.S.W.): The im-
pression in the article (B.
25/2/’4B) that liming costs “up
to £4 10s. per ton landed at the
farm” is misleading.
Lime is being delivered and
spread on the farm in the
Berrima (N.S.W.) district now
for an average of £2 2s. per ton.
Admittedly this is localised, but
is achieved with a fully
mechanised bulk-lime-spreading
service. This, unique in Aus-
tralia, has been extended to cover
the N.S.W. south coast, and will
shortly embrace the metropolitan
area. Still further expansion will
follow.
If soils, as claimed by “Pat
Ater,” require liming at two
tons per acre and more, it indi-
cates neglect over, perhaps, 20
years. The price paid for neglect
is always high and includes de-
clining fertility, listless and poor
herds and finally an outlay of
up to £9 per acre. So that this
“High Price of Lime” evidently
includes the high price of
neglect.
Lime from the Berrima district
can be delivered as far as the
Queensland border for
£2 11s. 7d. —a big difference
from the £4 10s. mentioned in
the article.
Cows and Pigs.
“F.L.”: From the economic
angle, farmers who run pigs
and milking-cows should con-
centrate their efforts on one of
the businesses or devise a means
of combining the two more suit-'
ably than is usual. Pigs should
not be allowed to forage freely
over cowpastures, as they foul
too much grazing that could be
more profitably used. Keep the
pigs apart on a section well away
from the cowyard and sheds
and see that their quarters are
kept healthy. Pig-feeding is done
more profitably where balanced
rations and proper quantities
are given. It’s high time that
more drastic steps were taken
generally to ensure that pigs are
kept in the best sanitary condi-
tions on dairy-farms.
Handling the milkers quietly
means less trouble in the cow-
yard and better production, and
pigs running loose aren’t con-
ducive to quietness. Run the
herd separately from other cattle
and springers; a dog that com-
mands respect but doesn’t work
vigorously is ideal for bringing
them to the yard. Develop a
system for the milking-shed so
that unnecessary time isn’t
wasted in putting the cows
through. Feeding in the bails
should be practised, providing a
supplementary ration as well as
having the cows more contented
at milking-time. Broken fences,
the presence of other stock or
dogs and careless methods are
time- and milk-wasters.
Kurrajongs.
“Momokan”: A park curator
with several thousand in his care
gives this advice: Dig a square
hole 3ft. deep, throwing the top-
soil to one side and the lower
clay into a separate heap. Make
the hole clean and square.
Thrust a crowbar deep down in
the exact centre, and then place
the long taproot of the tree in
the bar-hole. Pack the rich top-
soil tightly around the root and
fill in the topsoil. Ram tightly.
Fill the remainder of the hole
with water and, when it drains
away, throw the clay into the
balance of the hole. Don’t pack
“I couldn't take ’em to the Show this year, so I'm making
it up to 'em this Way."
this, but leave it loose. Water
again. A kurrajong planted
thus will grow rapidly and can
go for a long period without
further watering. To force
growth keep pruning the lower
leaves as they come.
Lucerne at Springsure.
“Archaps”: In the Springsure
district of Queensland, one of
the areas in which the Overseas
Food Corporation is interested
for the production of sorghum
and sunflower seed, lucerne
under irrigation is being suc-
cessfully established. A. E. O.
Iker dammed a watercourse to
provide the necessary water, and
incidentally it has provided a
large lake for sailing and swim-
ming. He says lucerne is the
best crop he knows to grow by
irrigation; it not only yields in
quantity and quality, but is the
easiest crop to handle.
Iker is also having success with
Biiffel grass, though perhaps not
quite such a good grass as
brown-top Rhodes. On coastal
scrub farms the latter is con-
sidered inferior to the African
variety, but Iker says stock show
a marked preference for brown-
top Rhodes, which will grow
on “scalded” patches (often
called claypan country), and as
it does not require pampering it
is the grass graziers appreciate. .
Iker finds that his stock are fond
of the much-maligned “feather-
top,” but this is only an annual
and it requires a fair amount of
moisture.
Irrigation Pays.
“Bill C.”: It is plain that few
localities in eastern Australia
escape drought. Anyone, there-
fore, who is thinking of starting
marketigardening should look
over the available water supplies
before going any further. There
may be no great amount of
water showing on the surface,
but indications may be that a
reasonable amount of boring
would tap abundant supplies.
If new to the district or un-
familiar with water signs, the
farmer should seek someone
with experience and be guided
by his' advice. But I suggest
that he find someone who will
work on scientific lines rather
than wander round with a
divining-rod and talk of “mys-
terious impulses.”
If water is there the cost of
irrigating a farm is seldom as
high as is expected. Go to a
firm handling irrigation material
and learn all about the prices
before planning the farm.
Irrigation, properly handled, can
make drought a friend rather
than an enemy, when a demand
for vegetables will soon see the
plant paying for itself.
Citrus Bugs.
“N.A.F.”: “W. Court’s” spray
for orange-bugs (B. 28/1/’4B)
is also effective, against scale in-
sects, but here is a simpler cure
for the bugs. In early life the
bugs are as thick as paper and
about fin. long and of a yel-
lowish-green color. They change
to a pea green, then a light
brown, dark brown and finally
black, when they are a little over
an inch long. It is only when
they are dark brown and black
that they show any indication of
being able to fly. If the trunk
or main branches of the tree be
quickly tapped with a stick every
bug on the tree will start mov-
ing quickly down to the ground.
They will continue this whilst
the tapping goes on.
When all bugs are out of the
tree place a 2in.-wide tin strip
around the tree under the
branching limbs and moisten it
with thin oil. The bugs lose no
time in attempting to crawl up
the tree when the tapping stops,
and the oil will prevent them
from gripping the surface of the
tin. Bugs can be killed on the
trunk or left to die of starvation
outside the tin barrier.
No citrus district had a greater
invasion of bugs than where this
was first tried. The trunks, after
tapping, were covered several
layers deep, and there would
have been several buckets to the
tree. These bugs eject a spray
that is painful and blinding to
the eyes, and handling them will
soon give raw, sore fingers.
Bloat.
“Myrrhee”: Autumn pastures
stimulated by an early seasonal
break, with the ground still
warm, can be risky. Potatoes,
pumpkins, carrots, mangels, etc.,
fed to excess, or hastily bolted
by hungry animals, can also
cause it. If bloating has just be-
gun, massage and knead the
abdomen in the left flank and
forcibly exercise the patient to
bring about belching. A wooden
gag placed across the mouth,
each end tied to a horn or
around the poll, will help.
In mild cases give one of these
mixtures: Sodium hyposulphite
2oz. to soz. in a pint of water;
or 2oz. of pure furps with 15
to 20 drops of oil of pepper-
mint in a pint of raw linseed oil;
or 2drms. of formalin in a pint
of water. A scrape of Stock-
holm tar across the back of the
tongue helps in milder attacks.
In advanced cases use the tro-
car and cannula. Clip the hair
over the highest point of the
distended left flank, midway
between the last rib and the
haunch. Disinfect with tincture
of iodine and insert the instru-
ment in a downward, forward
direction with sufficient force to
penetrate at one blow the abdo-
minal wall and the wall of the
paunch. Holding the cannula or
tube firmly, remove the trocar
to permit free escape of the
gases.
Cold Treatment.
“Sarina”: Cases of laminitis
or founder are often helped if
the victims are tied up to stand
in a cool, running stream. The
cold lessens the fever in the feet.
The same treatment is recom-
mended for sprains, knocks and
bruises affecting the limbs of
working horses. Normally, when
injury occurs, the part receives
an increased supply of blood,
and this causes the heat, swel-
ling and inflammation charac-
teristic of a sprain or “twist.”
In horses inflammation fol-
lowing a neglected injury can

tention if you want
him to remain fit and well. Watch for
signs of listlessness, poor appetite, warm
nose, dull or loose coat which are often
warnings that he is suffering from diges-
tive disorders. Give him Barko Condition

hampering the movement of a

Rabbit Eradication.
“Kamac”: Although “Curlew”
condemns the report of the Vic.
Graziers’ Association on rabbits
(B. 7/1/’4B), as a N.S.W. dairy-
farmer I am more inclined to
agree with the graziers than with
“Curlew.” In my opinion such
reports are necessary to counter-
balance statements (many of
them from official sources) em-
phasising the value of the rabbit
“industry” to this country'.
I know nothing of the methods
of the Victorian Lands Depart-
ment, but recently in this district
the local Pastures Protection
Board, acting on instructions
from the N.S.W. Government,
sent around an inspector who
chose at random from various
parts of the district a number of
farmers to be prosecuted for
having rabbits on their pro-
perties. The prosecutions were
duly carried out, each being
fined £lO plus costs, irrespective
of what efforts they were mak-
ing to get rid of the pests. Those
who were trying, despite labor
and other shortages, were highly
resentful, while those few short-
sighted ones who were farming
the rabbits for their skins were
not abashed. If the boards and
the Government had turned then-
efforts to organising supplies of
labor and materials, and re-
search into and publicising of
eradication methods, some good
may have resulted.
I will wager that few of those
5,000,000 rabbitskins mentioned
by “Curlew” were sent in by
genuine farmers, as few farmers
have the time to poison or trap
and skin rabbits in any large
proportion, however willing they
may be to turn their liability into
an asset.
As has been pointed out in
The Bulletin the only hope of
effective eradication is for con-
tinuous and relentless attack,
and, as the Graziers’ Association
points out, the main attack must
be on the burrows. Although
there is a number of excellent
fumigants available I have not
yet struck one which will repel
rabbits from treated burrows for
more than a few weeks. So that
a fumigant which would leave a
lasting repellent residue would
be of very great assistance, parti-
cularly to those, like myself, who
are only able to devote a limited
amount of time to the work.
Once the burrows are destroyed
the rabbit becomes easy prey,
A balance-sheet on the rabbit
would show a large sum on the
credit side, but the assets, how-
ever imposing they may seem,
would be insignificant when
compared with the liabilities. Not
only do they consume huge
quantities of grass which should
be there for stock, but they
monopolise the best of the pas-
tures and frequently kill the
softer grasses, and are a very big
contributing factor toward soil-
erosion.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: Seed supplies of
the new wheats —Insignia, Pin-
nacle and Diadem —are avail-
able from Victorian Department
of Agriculture research stations
at 13s. 4d. a bushel f.o.r. In-
signia is particularly suited to
the Mallee, Pinnacle and Dia-
dem to the Wimmera, and these
two, plus Quadrat, Magnet,
Baidmin and Ranee 4H, for
the central, north-east and other
wheat areas of the State.
“C.A.A.”: Phalaris tuberosa is
a most valuable fodder plant in
low-rainfall areas that won’t
support perennial rye grass or
clovers. To overcome cost, estab-
lish a nursery block of a few
acres and harvest the seed. This
will allow, in favorable circum-
stances, for a return of 401 b. of
seed, enough to sow 20 to 30
acres. Harvest with a binder,
stook, and then flail the leaves
or take off the heads with a
stripper or harvester and thresh.
Be sure to strip as soon as the
crop is ready, as Phalaris ripens
very quickly.
“Will C.”: To make a good
liquid stove-polish mix Boz. of
finely-powdered blacklead, £oz.
of lampblack and 2oz. of resin
thoroughly with half a gallon of
turpentine. Bottle ; shake well
before using. Because of the
inflammable fumes this mixture
should not be applied to the
stove while it is in use. Rub
briskly with a brush to impart
a shining polish.
“Gip”: To cut the top off a
bottle, bend a piece of wire into
a loop just large enough to fit
round the bottle where it is to
be cut; the wire should have no
kinks in it. Heat the loop
in a fire, then place it over the
neck of the bottle and hold it
there for a few seconds, then
plunge the bottle into cold
water. The top will fall
off, leaving a neat edge. To
smooth the cut surface twist the
bottle around in sand for 1 a few
minutes; wet sand gives the
best results.
“Sarina”: B batteries of radio-
sets are injured by damp con-
ditions, and may become quickly
useless in a wet season if the
radio is placed on the side of
the house against which the
rain drives continually. They
are also quickly spoiled by great
heat, and should not be directly
exposed to the sun while being
transported. They hold their
energy best when placed in a
cool, dry place, and when the set
is played quietly at all times.
“Radian”: Mix powdered
graphite to a thin paste with
machine-oil and keep a small tin
handy when working on mach-
inery. Threads on bolts, nuts
and screws which have been
coated with graphite may be
readily shifted after many years’
exposure to the weather. There
is nothing better to use on gas-
kets, particularly those sub-
jected to heat. For pipe-joints
and gaskets on water-pumps,
mix the graphite with boiled
linseed-oil instead of machine-
oil.
“Big Billy”; Tests at Werri-
bee over 12 months by Vic.
Department o f Agriculture
showed that vitaminised oil is a
reliable substitute for green feed
of poultry. Little difference was
noted in the production of eggs.
“Sarina”: If you want to drill
a hole in a sheet of glass, drop
a little ordinary alum into acetic-
acid and moisten the point of
the drill in the solution ; also
put a drop of the stuff on the
spot to be drilled. Ordinary
glass can usually be cut fairly
well with a sharp pair of scis-
sors if held under water, but to
cut glass perfectly straight apply
a red-hot iron rod to it for a
moment or two, then lower the
glass slowly into a vessel of
water.
“Oiler”: Rusted bolts and
nuts may be unscrewed easily if
heated by blowlamp or in the
fire. A dull-red color is sufficient
heat, reheating for a lengthy
thread. It’s advisable to hold the
bolt solidly with a vise or suit-
able wrench. A good practice is
to smear all threads with grease
or tar before fitting to prevent
bolt and nut rusting together.
Have dismantled structures with
bolts so treated after 20 years
and found the fittings in good
order; the lubricant had long
disappeared, but a protecting
scale saved the threads and made
unscrewing no great effort.

Another “Cold” War.
“During an exchange of protests
and counter-protests on trespassing in
the Falkland Islands between Chile,
Argentina and Britain the Argentinian
sloop King suddenly rushed in from
the sea and passed the R.N. ships
without saluting. The British sloop
Snipe immediately handed a protest
to King’s captain.”
The skipper of Snipe snuffled
sharply as the sloop slipped
slowly southwards through the
shallow shoals.
It promised to be another try-
ing day.
Yesterday he had tried to de-
liver a protest to the captain of
the flagship of Chilean Task
Force I£, the gunboat Manana
(240 tons gross, main armament
two muzzle - loader four -
pounders, one, or almost one,
torpedo-tube, one guitar band).
As they had slid past each other
at two knots, close in, Snipe’s
skipper had stuck the protest on
a long pole and pushed it across
to the bridge of Manana. But
the Chilean commander had de-
liberately crossed his arms and
refused to accept it, though he
bowed deeply with typical old-
world Spanish courtesy.
Next time they passed each
other that broth of a bhoy. Cap-
tain Don Miguel y Jose Car-
magnole del Orinoco y
O’Geoghan tossed a note
wrapped around a belaying-pin
on to the deck of Snipe. It
would assuredly have contained
a hot protest at the blatant
British hide in trespassing on
British property had it not been
that the captain, following
Chilean custom, signed with his
full signature first, and this had
left no room on the paper for
the protest.
Snipe’s skipper had
his chance that afternoon as he
watched the Chilean going
around in circles for about an
hour. When it still kept going
he decided to go around with
it in the hope of getting close
enough to deliver his protest, but
“I don't care if you ARE a Cadillac—you cant park here!
he had to desist when the crew
'began getting giddy. The Chilean
was still going round in circles
when Snipe was hull-down on
the horizon, as the helmsman
had locked the wheel and was
dreamily strumming on a man-
dolin.
Later that day, when they
passed again, Captain Don
Miguel, etc., wearing a fearfully
belligerent look, spat over the
side in contempt of the pathetic
weakness of the Royal Navy,
albeit he made courtly bow to
Snipe’s white ensign. Then he
sighted some British tars bring-
ing up boxes from below.
Mistaking the cases of m, and
v. for ammo., he recalled an
urgent appointment over the
horizon and ordered, first, full,
and then fuller, speed.
Some time later the Argentine
sloop Glamoro Senorita, in a
burst of sheer truculence, rushed
past op the horizon, the sailors
lining the decks and fiercely
playing jai alai, diabolo and yo-
yo. As it became a smudge on
the skyline again Manana re-
appeared. A hoist up the hal-
yards to the yardarm was
crowded with singlets and shirts.
Unfortunately Snipe’s skipper
wasn’t to know that all °f
Manana’s signal-flags had been
cut up because of a shortage of
dishrags, and he missed the pro-
test, thinking it was ship’s wash-
ing-day. Again a day had ended
without a protest having been
received or delivered.
As Snipe was cruising along
around midday Manana was
sighted steaming slowly towards
Snipe. The skipper called for
half-speed, and, hastily reading
over the mildly-worded protest
at Chile having claimed 2,000,000
square miles of British Antarc-
tic territory, he waited for the
Chilean, which kept steadily on
its course.
When it was within a few
hundred yards, and as the bosun
stood poised with, his shanghai
ready to fling the rolled-up pro-
test on to Manana’s bridge,
Snipe’s skipper realised the
Chilean didn’t intend stopping
and that if he didn’t move
quickly he might be rammed.
He ordered hard a-starboard
and full speed, and as Manana
chugged past he swung hisi
glasses on her. Then it dawned
on him it was siesta-hour and
the whole crew, including the
helmsman, would be asleep.
Frustrated again, he pocketed
the protest, decided to call it a
day and ordered the mainbrace
spliced. He decided he would
deliver it personally when both
skippers were ashore.
But he needn’t have worried.
That afternoon a rating from the
Glamoro Senorita threw his
diabolo out too far and it
knocked a yo-yo out of a
Chilean petty-officer’s hand.
In the subsequent upsurge of
fierce national hatred and the
birth of another “international
incident” a fierce rash of
Chilean-Argentinian notes broke
out, and the squabbles with
Britain over the Falklands were
quite forgotten.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4|tL per line; all others 2£d. per line.
More of Them
The proposed increases in membership
of the Federal 'Parliament will cost the
taxpayer an extra £107,500 a year, and
that at £l time the House of Commons is
being reduced from 640 to 604.
The Commonwealth, population
7,000,000, is to have 122 Representatives ;
on that proportion Britain, with a popu-
lation of 45,000,000, would be entitled to
793 —189 more than the House of Com-
mons',
Australia’s administration' is in no way
comparable with the burdens and prob-
lems confronting England. people
were not in any way consulted about the
increase, and it’s not surprising that
voters, mostly workers', can only describe
the proposed increase in unprintable
terms.
Will an extra 71 party hacks win one
additional ton of coal or increase pro-
duction of essential goods one iota? Will
they control strikes and take the ad-
ministration of our foreign policy out
of the hands' of Communist-controlled
unions? Will they make the woman’s
burden one ounce lighter by eliminating
blackout, shortages and the packhorse
conditions entailed in providing the
home with food? Or will the increase in
numbers reduce taxation and bureau-
cracy, or induce politicians to practice
that thrift and economy they so glibly
preach?
No ; 71 or 701 extra politicians would
not have the slightest effect on any of
those things. Existing statutes contain all
the legal powers needed to control any
strike or industrial upheaval if the crowd
in office has the courage to use them.
The only solution seems to be to change
the crowd, and the one in control is
doing its' utmost to render that impos-
sible—it has the Senate sewn up until
at least 1952.
As a rule the politician’s cunning
greatly exceeds his wisdom, but few have
forgotten the G.-G. episode, or how Mc-
Girr hurled a 40-hour-week bomb into
the economical and industrial activities
of the State, declaiming that it would
“ensure equal output” with the 44-hour
week. Other matters, such as those
criticised in the Auditor-General’s report,
or the easy possession of hundreds of
thousands of petrol tickets by an infant
in law, have not increased Parliamentary
prestige.
It is obvious that another 71 political
deadheads would only mean more stink-
ing political fish, more expensive official'
motor-cars and more costly jaunts
overseas at the expense of an already
overtaxed and overcontrolled people.—
B. J. H. (N.S.W.).
New States
A larger Federal Parliament simply
means a stronger domination of Australia
by four cities. New States are the best
counter to centralisation, but proposals
so far mooted don’t go far enough. A
complete reorganisation of government
is needed with political divisions con-
forming to natural regions.
In N. S. Wales six new provinces
could be created —New England with the
north-west plains, the Hunter Valley
area, the central slopes and plains, the
Riverina, the South Coast and the North
Coast —each with its capital city. Queens-
land would fall into the three areas based
on Brisbane, Rockhampton and Towns-
ville. Victoria would be carved into
Gippsland, a western province and the
southern part of Riverina. Sydney and
Melbourne, each with a small surround-
ing area, would become independently-
governed cities after the style of the old
German “Imperial” towns.
Emphasis would be laid on the pro-
vincial Governments. They would be the
taxing authorities, and the Federal Gov-
ernment would be supported by grants
from each province in proportion to
population and income. Otherwise, re-
spective functions would be much as now,
except that the cumbersome and expen-
sive railways system could be sold piece-
meal to private enterprise—if anyone
would buy it. —K. A. S. (N.S.W.).
Injustice
The departmental-cnmmnionist perse-
cution of persons wanting to work (B.
25/2/’4B), after factory hours reveals the
insecurity of our rights and liberties
under “Labor” Governments. Even
more terrifying, however, is the attitude
°f public “servants” in these cases.
The inspectors obviously lent them-
selves to “hunting-down” persons who
offended union susceptibilities by want-
ing to work; the chief inspector and the
under-secretary failed to “check” the
instructions to prosecute, while the Chief
Industrial Magistrate delivered a remark-
able homily to the second victim, who was
heavily fined “because the law was there.”
Whatever may be said of the depart-
mental inspectors, it was to the interest
of the union officials to secure a fine,
for they share in what is imposed. The
connivance of the chief inspector and the
under-secretary is harder to understand
until it is known whether there is any
check by senior officials upon frivolous
prosecutions.
But what can we say of the
magistrate disclaiming responsibility?
The duty of the Courts, in our judicial
system, is to see that justice and equity
correct the ruthless administrative appli-
cation of the law. Our Courts have never
been, or not until recently, the passive in-
strument to register the wishes of the
Administration. It is highly important
that they should preserve the judicial
tradition in these days when administra-
tive actions are too often influenced by
party politics.— F. A. Bland, University
of Sydney.
Labor Shortages
For over two years the manufacture
of luxury goods has been causing labor
shortages in essential industries. Extrava-
gant leather goods, plastic doo-dahs,
imitation jewellery, chrome-plated what-
nots and dozens of other semi-useless
lines are still filling many display-
windows. Obviously there’s more profit
in luxury goods—there is no ceiling price
on many lines—and with greater profits-
margin, manufacturers can pay more than
award wages.
It’s futile to blame the manufacturers,
even though some are the get-rich-quick
type of rather new .Australians. What is
needed is a review of ceiling prices on
essentials—many of these are barely a
paying proposition for manufacturer or
retailer. Raising ceiling-prices would help
old-established firms to show profit-
margins and to compete in the labor mar-
ket for key workers. And the spending
public could buy something sensible for
its money.
Temporary non-registration of any new
firms not handling essential goods might
help, but there are already too many con-
trols hampering trade. The only other
remedy for labor shortages in essential
industries rests with the workers. They
must realise that luxury trades cannot
last for ever and that it is better for them
to get into essential industries and dig
themselves in.—A. S. B. (Vic.).
R.A.A.F. Squadrons
Efforts by Mr. Drakeford to perpetuate
the work of R.A.A.F. squadrons have
failed miserably, apparently because of
his ignorance of the early air war against
the Japanese.
His announcement that, three squadrons
of the heavy-bomber wing at Amberley
(Q.) were to be renamed One, Two and
Six Squadrons in recognition of the work
of those squadrons in the war, was a
shock to, old members of Eight and
Thirteen Squadrons.
Although Six came into the picture a
few months later, the first brunt of the
attack was borne by One and Eight
Squadrons at Khota Baru, Malaya, and
Two and Thirteen from Ambon.
One and Eight were wiped out —
although many of the air crews subse-
quently escaped—while Two and Thirteen
were forced back to Darwin through
shortage of planes. Many airstrips in
the South-West Pacific were later named
after the pilots who failed to return.
In a subsequent dispatch, General Mac-
Arthur praised the work of these Lock-
heed Hudson squadrons which “held
fort” until reinforcements came from
America. Number One aliso gained a
mention in the recent report of Air Chief-
Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, with
whom I had the honor to fly on a trip
from Singapore to Darwin before the
declaration of war with Japan.
I spent an operational tour with
Thirteen, and will never forget the fine
men who, with the odds against them,
went out to certain death. Little was
published of their work at the time. To-
day it is forgotten.
Mr. Drakeford would be acting wisely
in future if he consulted the Air Force
Association or the war-time officers be-
fore renaming squadrons. Otherwise he
will continue to hurt the feelings of what
is left of these heroic units.—Wadd-
lin’ Willie (Vic.).
Afrikan(d)ers
In B. 17/12/ ’47 the hope was expressed
that Earle. Page and Eggins had taken
precautions to prevent Afrikanders mis-
taking them for Dr. Evatt.
It would be a hard day indeed if some
of our more wild, humpbacked, long-
horned Afrikanders made an attack on
any of them —the animal is a large,
humpbacked, spread-horned bovine.
An Afrikaner is any white person liv-
ing in South Africa who is not descended
from British stock. Strictly, however, the
definition is not quite accurate, for the
Frasers, McGregors, Nicols, Freemantles
and others all class themselves as
Afrikaners, but were originally bred from
Calvinistic Scotsmen who quarrelled with
the Scottish Church and migrated, chiefly
to the Orange Free State. —F. D. Rose
Price (Johannesburg, S. Africa).
The Bosses
-AJn item from the Melbourne press:
FIRST PETROL FROM N.E.I. SINCE
WAR.
Action will not be taken by Melbourne
waterfront unions to prevent the discharge
of 3,500,(X)0 gallons of petrol from Sumatra
> (East Indies), which arrived today in the
Vacuum Oil Co.’s tanker Stanvac Manila.
It is the first shipment to reach Australia
from the N.E.I. since the war.
An official of the Waterside Workers’
Federation said today that he did not know
the Federation’s present policy on Dutch
shipping, but no action would be taken.
Where are the Prime Minister’s “Aus-
tralia’s Foreign Policy” or the Federal
Parliament? Apparently “an official of
the Waterside Workers’ Federation” does
not allow any of them so much as an
honorable mention. —E. & O. E. (Tas.).
More Eggs?
About a year ago I bought a property
consisting of dwelling and cleared land
to. start a poultry-farm. In high hopes I
ordered a tractor from Sydney, filled in
"I'll have a bottle of Red Ned and one of Satan's
Kiss Cocktail—the girls are having a party.”
my permit for wire-netting and went on
with the job. I built hen-houses and
wired in a few of them with some netting
that came with the property. These I
stocked with, enough fowls to start. After
that I put in incubators.
Then I began wondering about my
tractor, and discovered thjat its delivery
was delayed for three moftth§ by a rail-
way strike. Meanwhile, the rains set in
and the weeds grew so high that I couldn’t
use the tractor when it came, I had to
hire a man with a rotary-hoe. There was
still no word of wire-netting, so I wrote
to the local member, who in turn wrote
off and tried to hurry things up for me.
After all these months I am still with-
out netting, and can get no indication of
when it will be available. My fowl-
houses are so overstocked that I have to
fatten up surplus birds for sale instead
of keeping them as layers. Feed is scarce
and dear, and I am continually wasting
petrol by running to the nearest town,
16 miles away, to search for growing-
mash and laying-mash. I can’t get pol-
lard or wheat, in spite of the glut, and
there is very little corn.
In view of all this I couldn’t help a
cynical smile when I read Mr. Pollard’s
blithe remarks about increasing, our ex-
port of eggs to Britain by about
60,000,000 dozen.—l. R. D. (N.S.W.).
Rather than helping poultry-farmers,
the Egg Board seems to be strangl-
ing the game. In my district many
small farmers with less than 1000 birds
are being forced out of business by un-
satisfactory returns and shortages of feed.
During one month one farmer marketed
148 dozen eggs and received £l3 9s. 2d.,
with a dockage of £3 6s. 3d., or 25 per
cent., made by the board for some ob-
scure reason. Another sold 33 dozen and
received 11s. 3d., or 4d. per dozen as
against the present retail price of 3s. Id.
In 1934-35 price of f.a.q. wheat was
3s. 6d. and net return from eggs Is.
Today it’s wheat 7s. 6d. and eggs Is. 5d,,
but the poultryman does not get the dif-
ference. Another criticism of the board
is that it pays three weeks after delivery.
If the price is rising farmers receive the
rate ruling at the time of delivery; if it
falls they get the price at the date of
.payment, so they lose both ways.
No more eloquent example of mis-
handling of our grain 'harvest could be
had than the experience of a neighbor
here. Going 10 miles to the largest
wheat-seller in his shopping centre he
was allowed only one bag of wheat, and
that in a depot containing hundreds of
bags.— Plain Australian (Vic.).
The Bible
Some Australian preachers are agitat-
ing for a new translation of the Bible,
holding that the language of the present
version is archaic aryl unreadable. No
argument could be more ridiculous. Can
anyone imagine a simpler legal document
than the Decalogue?
One reason why the Scriptures are not
“searched” is that they are usually pre-
sented in funereal binding and small print,
and so cluttered up with marginal notes
and cross-references that they seem to
threaten rather than promise. Another
reason is that parsons themselves treat
the Word more like a telephone index
than a historical record. The average
sermon consists of a short text and a long
exposition ; and the “dissertations” never
follow each other in logical sequence.
If the Gospels, Epistles and Parables
were read from beginning to end without
remark ordinary people would hear
them gladly and prefer them to often un-
inspired pulpit oratory.
There’s a story of a devout old lady
who was presented with a ponderous
Commentary. When asked how her
studies were progressing she replied:
“That big book is a bit difficult to under-
stand, but my Bible
throws a lot of light on
it.” — Authorised (S.A.).

Root of the Matter
The announcement
that the Soldier Settle-
ment Commission in Vic-
toria plans an additional
scheme to settle 5000
more men on the land,
mostly in the Western
District, at a cost to the
taxpayer of £14,000,000,
makes strange reading.
Three years after the war
the original scheme has
not accomplished its
objective of settling 1500
ex-servicemen. When
that plan was proposed
Western District dairy-
men offered to provide
the Commission with
8000 heifers, to be made
available to the men as
they took up their hold-
ings. Most of these ani-
mals are now four or five
years old and will soon
be useless for thfcir intended purpose.—
Plain Australians (Vic.).
Why does “Labor,” with its “all for
the working man” policy, class as “tem-
porary” employees who have been in the
Commonwealth Public Service for a
quarter of a century, and so bar them
from superannuation? Despite 25 years’
service, 109 members are still “tem-
porary,” while another 1708 “tem-
poraries” have passed the 10-year mark,
and 12,387 the five-year mark. Another
54,063 are in their first five years. Most
of these employees do a job equal to or
better than the “perms,” yet no effort is
made to give them security for the future.
-—Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
Mr. Chifley’s army of buckshee clerks
toiling for him at industry’s expense has
received another burden. Invariably the
Delegate of the Treasurer disallows the
sale price of real .estate, already agreed
upon by seller and buyer. If the seller
advises the Treasurer that he is agree-
able to the reduced selling price, com-
monsense would accept his consent as
sufficient. But the harassed agent then
has to chasp up the buyer and ask him
to sign a letter signifying his assent to
buy the property at the lower price. He’d
be a mug if, after contracting to purchase
a house for, say, £lOOO, he refused to
buy at £950. — Bramley (S.A.).
When our baby was coming along the
doctor gave me a certificate to present to
the police station for sufficient petrol to
make fortnightly visits over the last two
months in a neighbor’s car. I was given
application-forms to fill in every time the
neighbor had to take me in, then I was
told “only fill in one form for every
trip and only for when they bring you
into the hospital to have the baby—there
is no allowance for petrol to come and
get you when you have to go home.”
I’m wondering how I’ll manage that 10-
mile walk home with a new baby and a
suitcase. —E. M. R. (S.A.).
