BLOCKADE
Sir,
1 am confronted by Alexander Maren-
tek, Press Secretary at the Indonesian
Embassy, and Herbert Feith of Monash
University (30/5/64) because I sug-
gested (9/5/64) that the most economic
use of force to counter Indonesian
aggression in Borneo would be a block-
ade of Java by the navies of Britain,
Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand
even if it led to the fragmentation of the
Indonesian Empire.
Mr Marentek counters my charge of
Indonesia’s “gangsterism” and “banditry”
by referring to “the present aggression
in Yemen . . . and the merciless exploi-
tation by colonial and neo-colonial
nations now and in the past!” Opinions
vary as to who is the aggressor in
Yemen but his argument amounts to
two wrongs making a right. The virtual
annexation by force of West Irian by
Indonesia is an example of “colonial-
ism”, but Indonesia justifies it on the
ground that it was a Dutch possession.
By the same token Malaysia could claim
Sumatra because it once belonged to
Britain!
Herbert Feith condemns a blockade as
being “impracticable” and “undesirable”,
his main argument being that it would
not be a “clean break” and “would
almost certainly mark the beginning of
a period of civil war”. But whereas
any fragmentation caused by a blockade
would be a controlled fragmentation,
with some control over the filling of a
power vacuum, that resulting from the
probable breakdown of Indonesia’s
economy or the certain eventual demise
of her present ruler, would almost cer-
tainly mark the beginning of a civil war.
If I have provoked thought on the use,
or lack of use, of sea-power (which in-
cludes co-ordination of its air and land
components) to halt aggression my pur-
pose has been achieved.

EXPOSITION

their significance, has undermined the
persuasiveness of the line which has been
run over the last four months.
The comment in “Plain English” of
May 23 is a new height in the misinter-
pretation or misuse of economic statis-
tics. The “line” is that, since average
earnings rise without the intervention of
the Arbitration Commission, the case for
a substantial increase of the basic wage
on top of this is weakened. To justify
the line it is claimed that in the Decem-
ber quarter alone, average earnings rose
over 8.9 per cent, and exhausted in three
months increases in productivity which
can be expected in the next four years.
This is nonsense. Earnings always rise
substantially in the December quarter,
and always fall in the March quarter
as a result of seasonal factors—the pre-
Christmas rush, and then the dead period
in January being the most obvious.
One reason for the increase in actual
take-home pay (earnings) is that between
the September and December quarters
overtime worked increased about 16
per cent—your correspondent appears to
be confused about the difference between
working longer hours and receiving more
pay at fixed hourly rates, and working
the same hours and getting more pay
from higher rates. “Earnings” figures
do not give any guide to wage rates,
which is what the Arbitration Commis-
sion is attempting to determine; it is
wage rates, or the amount paid for an
hour’s work, which are matched with
productivity.
Average weekly wage rates increased
lOd. between the quarters chosen by
your correspondent. Would he still
claim the Commonwealth Statistician
emerges in the starring role at the basic
wage hearing? A rise of lOd. in average
award rates represents approximately one
quarter of one per cent, not 8.9 per
cent. It is average award rates which
the Arbitration Commission is respon-
sible for adjusting.

AUSTRALIAN BALLET
Sir,
It seems to me that there is an appal-
ling lack of imagination among all
peoples connected with the ballet world
in Sydney, from the Trust Director,
Stefan Haag, to your critic Kevon Kemp.
In setting out to form an Australian
ballet company one would have thought
that more consideration would have been
given to providing an artistic director
with a desire to develop a truly Austra-
lian approach. At first glance it might
seem as if Peggy Van Praagh has done a
good job with our dancers, but the truth
is that she has made an English ballet
company in Australia.
Take a look at Australian ballet his-
tory ... we have had a Russian com-
pany, Austrian expressive dance, Ameri-
can jazz ballet, an attempt to adopt a
culture as foreign to us as that of any
Asian peoples—that of the Australian
Aboriginal—and finally, a mixture of all
that has gone before only with a distinct
English flavor. What chance do we
choreographers have, then, of developing
an Australian style? No wonder the
critics and the audiences are still waitin°
for an Australian ballet to emerge”
Choreographers are forced to imitate
English standards and style or go Ameri-
can with jazz. It is time we went Aus-
tralian and began to present our own
folklore on stage.

THE ARMED SERVICES
Sir,
Your article, “The Right to Resign",
and the letter from “ Sardonicus”
(16/5/64) express lucidly the basic un-
certainties that worry members of the
Armed Services today. One would hope
that the Minister for Defence, when he
presents his “catalogue” of disparities to
Cabinet, will endeavor to persuade his
colleagues to permit Servicemen to:—j
(a) Form some sort of industrial associ-
ation with the right of free assembly, tol
discuss conditions of pay and servicej
(b) be paid overtime —with penalty rates
for work performed on weekends and
public holidays; (c) adopt a 36i-hour
working week; (d) accumulate sick leave
entitlements; (e) communicate with the
Press over their own names on unclas-
sified topics such as this.
Your readers will know that all of thi
above rights are enjoyed by public ser
vants already.

SURFING
Sir,
Discus’ derisive comments about tk
recent surfboard championships at Manlf
(30/5/ 64) must have aroused a lot oi
antagonism among surfers. A veteran
surfer of 12 years’ experience, mainly
at Durban beaches, South Africa, I
can understand Discus’ feelings about
surfing years ago, when it took a special
breed of fanatic to brave the big waves.
But because surfing styles have changed
there is no need to castigate the “bean-
vine” characters who follow the sport
today. I, myself, favor big-wave riding,
and the somewhat ungraceful style you l
have to use to handle these waves. But,
give credit where it is due: the bean-
vine surfers have developed a fantastic
technique, which allows them to be both 1
graceful and in perf ct control of the
motion on any wave.
Surf-riding is a new sport, and, conse- (
quently, it is “down the bottom of the
sports table” as Discus says. How-
ever, the intelligent follower of surfing
can point out the tremendous growth of
the sport in the past five years.

CRITICS OF THE SHOW
Sir,
Your article “The Royal Easter Show
and Its Critics” (14/3/64) was so bad
that even at this distance in time and
space I am impelled to comment. Your
author feels “that the criticism of Shows
by the intellectuals . . . has a deeper
significance”. Elsewhere he calls Show
critics “eggheads”, compares the criticism
of Shows with being “slightly Left”,
calls it a way of working off grievances.
In contrast to his type of argument
that of the critics of Shows is unemo-
tional and objective. As I understand
it, it is that objective selection tech-
niques have been convincingly demon-
strated to be superior to the subjective
methods of the show-ring. The vested
interests of the studs and shows are
criticised because they are slowing down
the improvement of the nation’s sheep
and cattle.
Your author implies that scientific
breeding is inapplicable to sheep and
cattle because their environment calls
for a rugged constitution. Then he goes
on to discuss the hot-house techniques
of raising stud bulls. Does he really
think that animals selected under these
conditions are likely to be suitable for
commercial production in, say, the
Northern Territory?
I am not inclined to blame the studs
for their attitude. It is a fact that prices
at present are determined by the magic
word “Imp.” and by the number of
show ribbons. But it is also a fact that
direct comparisons have shown objective
methods of selection to be superior in
wool, meat and milk production.

GERALDTON
Sir,
With reference to your article “An
A-Bomb for Geraldton” (2/5/64), my
Chamber takes exception to your descrip-
tion of Geraldton as “a sleepy port”.
It is quite obvious that your corre-
spondent is from Perth and it does not
appear likely that he has been up here
in recent years, otherwise he would know
that, outside of Fremantle, Geraldton
vies with Bunbury and Albany for the
biggest tonnage of shipping. The port
itself houses one of the largest fishing
fleets in Australia, and the town has
expanded since the war at a rate greater
than that of WA as a whole, and is
continuing to do so.
GRAHAM W. LEEVERS
President, Geraldton

STATE AID FOR SCHOOLS
Sir,
According to E. K. Wargent
(30/5/64) “the State schools are in
desperate need of help” and to provide!
any State funds for the assistance of non-
State schools is “against the national/
interest”. It would seem, then, that the
real champions of the national interest
must be those thousands of parents who
contribute to the public money but edu-
cate their children at no expense to the
State. This permits the State to use all
the available funds to educate part of the
nation’s schoolchildren. Without such
parents public money would be required
to do a great deal more than at present.
Spokesmen for the Secular Education
Society should avoid reference to “pub-
lic money”. The term implies owner-
ship by all the people and leads to the
belief that disbursements on vital
national needs should benefit all the
people.
BERNARD MARTIN
Brighton (SA).
MONEY FOR ROADS
Sir, I
Richard Hall’s article on the road'
problem (23/5/64) strikes one as a
parade of familiar facts and opinions,
without any definite suggestion as to
what should be done about it. In assum-
ing taxation to be the only source oil
money Mr Hall falls into the same futile'
error that most do in looking at this
question.
Immediately we enter this arena, where
there is endless argument by those likely
to be taxed, we come upon the principal
explanation as to why there are plenty
of plans “but not enough action.” Where
is the money to come from? This is the
barrier that wrecks all plans, whether
five-year or ten-year, and until a satis-
factory answer is forthcoming this
wrangling and the bad roads will con-
tinue to be with us.
The banks have no difficulty in find-
ing money for industrial development,
and at present there are some £BOO
million in unused overdraft limits. When
these overdrafts are drawn upon they
will be actually an investment in industry.
And they mean, also, that additional
money to that sum will have been
created, for that is what occurs when a
bank makes a loan.
Why not have the Reserve Bank, as
the nation's own bank, create the money
needed to give us a proper system of
roads?
What a return we would get from
such an investment. It is estimated that
traffic delays due to inadequate roads
are costing Australia between £2OO
million and £4OO million a year.

how to probe a problem at depth!
Westinghouse is building a remarkable
craft, a free roaming explorer of the
underseas. Deepstar they call it. At
depths of up to two miles it will explore
the ocean floor, probing and peering
in the service of mankind. But its final
significance only starts here.
Advanced as this concept is, it rep-
resents only a small part of the world-
wide activity that is Westinghouse.
Westinghouse generators and transfor-
mers bring electricity to millions.
Westinghouse nuclear reactors are
operating on sea and shore. The world’s
first practical sea-water de-salting plant
is Westinghouse. And in homes every-
where there are the superb home
appliances that bear the Westinghouse
name.
All these technical resources and skills
are represented here, in Australia,
through the Email organisation and
its links with Westinghouse across the
world. Email has served Australia now
for over 50 years. It is this dedication
to engineering and science and to the
needs of the Australian community that
has made Email a significant part of our
way of life.

National Notebook
Wielding Power
Something of the cloud that has
surrounded the rich Power bequest
for art and the intentions of the Uni-
versity of Sydney regarding it has been
dispelled by the energy and tact of Pro-
fessor John White of the University of
Manchester, who has been'in Australia
over the past few weeks to investigate
ways and means of implementing the
will of Dr Power.
In a hectic round of talks and con-
ferences in Sydney and Melbourne the
Professor has seen or talked to “many
more than a hundred people” on what
to do with the income from the £l.B
million capital left to the University for
the establishment of a Faculty of Fine
Arts.
Professor White, who holds the chair
of the History of Art at the University
of Manchester and is also
a director of Whitworth
Gallery, is a young-look-
ing 39.
Interviewed last week,
the Professor was cau-
tious. “I don’t want a hor-
rible sort of personal
build-up. It’s most important that people
should not think I came out from Britain
just to tell people what to do.”
By way of a preliminary to discussing
the Power bequest he was happy to out-
line how he had built up the Whitworth
Gallery in the five years he has been at
Manchester. Although run by the Uni-
versity, the Whitworth is a public
gallery, with a programme of lectures
and collaboration with adult education
groups, and talks from working artists.
In Sydney the Professor's wide-ranging
talks have been designed not only to
gather ideas on how the new Faculty
might be set up, but to work out the
pattern for a future modus vivendi
between the new institution and the
rest of Sydney’s art world. “It would be
no good,” he says, “if someone set up
a private little empire at the University
and went on as though no one else
existed.”
Nor does Professor White see that it is
the function of the University to take
over other people’s jobs by setting up an
art school to replace the traditional
teaching centre, East Sydney Tech., or
the private art schools.
On his recommendations to the Senate
of the University the Professor is
cautious, stressing that he is an adviser
laying down possibilities and gathering
opinions.
The base for the new institution would
be a “normal academic department in
the full sense”. This would give the
conventional courses on the history and
appreciation of art. While the courses
would deal with the “contemporary”,
this would not mean only Western Art,
but take in Oriental or for that matter
authentic Aboriginal contemporary
work.
While the courses would be open to
undergraduates from say Arts and
Architecture there would also be a work-
ing arrangement for students from the
East Sydney Tech, to attend certain, if
not all, lectures.
The Faculty would also have a
gallery, “small at first, but capable of
expansion in stages and with its own
lecture theatre and one or two studios
for young painters to work in on
fellowships”. The Professor suggests
“relatively strict interpretation of ‘con-
temporary’ works of the last 20 years
or of living painters”. The
gallery should go after
overseas works, with the
local galleries building up
their Australian collec-
tions. “It would be mad
to start collecting Austra-
lian art in a big way and it
wasn’t what Power intended, anyhow.”
The word “co-operation” keeps crop-
ping up again and again in the role
that the Professor sees the Power bequest
playing in the future. “There’s an
enormous range of ability in Sydney
and this new thing cannot be isolated
from it,” he said.
Let Battle Commence
T)erhaps the most fascinating battle
being waged in the Victorian elec-
tions is that between Dinny Lovegrove,
Labor, Deputy Leader of the Opposition
in the Legislative Assembly, and Nino
Randazzo, assistant editor of “II Globo”.
“II Globo” was the brave newspaper
that waged an assault on the Mafia's
activities at the Victoria Market. Ran-
dazzo is the first post-war Italian migrant
in Australia to try for Parliament and
he likes his chances. Look at the situa-
tion. He is in Fitzroy, our Little Italy.
There are 3000 Italians in the district
and one-third of the 16,000 on the roll
are Continentals. So Randazzo is cam-
paigning everywhere in Italian and Eng-
lish. He can hardly miss out on the
Continental votes.
It is the only electorate in Australia
where the DLP can gather more votes
than the Liberals and Randazzo says he
has only to win 500 votes from the
Liberal-Country Party and Labor to win.
Then he has a curious piece of history
up his sleeve to impress the old Aus-

Rationalist
Seventy people turned out last week
for a meeting of the Rationalist
Association in Sydney held as a
memorial to James Vance Marshall, the
Australian writer and socialist, whose
death in Lebruary at the age of 76
passed all but unnoticed. Walter Stone,
one of the four speakers saluting his
memory, struck the resounding chord
of the night when he called him “one
of the living spirits of the Australian
tradition”—a tribute to soothe tough,
old radical hearts in the audience.
Vance Marshall was a Port Street boy
and the son of a Presbyterian minister.
During the Pirst World War he was
secretary of the Social Democratic
League in Sydney, a rallying point for
opponents of conscription. His eloquence
twice got him into Long Bay for causing
disaffection to the King, and he wrote
two small impassioned books about his
experiences there, one of which, “The
World of the Living Dead”, has a preface
by Henry Lawson, his long-time friend.
Lawson’s poem “The Vagabond” was
the inspiration, Marshall always said,
of a “world rove” that lasted most of his
life. He became, among other things, a
jockey and journalist in Shanghai, a
fcttler in the Rockies, a timberworker
in Siberia, a trader in the Aleutians, and
a teetotaller in a Jamaican rum dis-
tillery. He was also a telephone lines-
man in Colombia, where he once used
skulls for insulators when the regular
supply ran out. In his respectable later
years he lived in England and became
a London magistrate and a lecturer to
the Lorces. He returned to Australia
after the Second War and settled in
Oberon, NSW, to flourish as a writer of
books and a gentle correspondent.
In 1926 Marshall published “Timely
Tips for New Australians”, which he
afterwards reckoned established his
priority as coiner of the latter-day
phrase for migrants. But his real and
extraordinary fruitfulness as an author
did not come until he was over 70. It

what idealised story of two children who
survive a plane crash in the Australian
outback, was reissued last year in the
Peacock series of paperbacks for young
people published by Penguin.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Bishops and the Pill
gISHOP CARROLL, one of the
three auxiliary bishops to Car-
dinal Gilroy, last week reiterated
the Roman Catholic Church’s op-
position to the use of contraceptive
pills. “The Church has no power
to revise the laws of God”, he said.
The issue however is surely not
yet closed and many people will
ponder the words of Archbishop
Roberts, the former Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Bombay, published
in the London Christian Newsletter
“Search”:
“Where authority is concerned,
have we absolute certainty that this
matter of contraception is not liable
to the same changes as happened in
the case of usury? The attitude of
any modern confessor to lending
money at interest is totally different
from what obtained about 400 years
ago. Economists have taught us
things about money that were not
then realised. The same may be
true of the laws of nature. Quite
certainly St. Francis Xavier and
people of his time maintained that
outside the Church there is no sal-
vation, using the word “Church”
in a sense as different as possible
from that of the Fathers of the
Second Vatican Council.
“That change grew inevitably out
of our greater knowledge of history,
of the age of the human race, the
size of the earth, etc.
“The concept of slavery has
changed immensely. It is only a
hundred years ago since half the
people of the United States were
prepared to die in defence of slavery.
“The end of marriage is not to
have as many children as physically
possible, but to have as many as
can be brought to lead happy and
useful lives. A typical case: an
Indian lives in a mud-hut with his
wife and several children, too poor
to be able to afford any light and
forced to be with his wife every
night for twelve hours in the dark
and having nothing else at all but
her love.
“The Catholic missionary gives
him the alternatives complete
abstention or the safe period. His
village birth-control clinic says the
Government has spent huge sums
on “safe period” methods only to
be convinced they are doubtfully
safe, certainly impracticable for
India. So the doctor offers free
sterilisation with the reminder that
another pregnancy will either leave
his six children motherless, or if
mother and child survive, add an-
other stomach to eight already swol-
len with hunger. The Protestant
missionary suggests that nature did
not give sex organs only for the
production of children, but also,
even independently, for the expres-
sion marrieci love - He offers a
contraceptive not as an ideal solu-
tion but as a lesser evil than steril-
isation, than abortion, than the
hunger of his children, than the
death of his wife or the death of
their married life,
“It is that advice which we
Catholics must condemn as un-
natural. Those of us who can’t see
why or how to convict of crime
the millions who see contraception
as a right or duty within marriage
—we certainly may and must press
for the acceptance by the General
Council of the challenge to justify
by reason our own challenge to the
world made in the name of reason.”
Goldwater
JN one of those fascinating re-
versals of form which make
US politics the world’s most un-
predictable, Senator Goldwater has
narrowly beaten Governor Rocke-
feller in the California primary
and must barring unforeseen
accidents —be considered as get-
ting the Republican nomination
for President. Before winning Cali-
fornia’s Republican votes Gold-
water refused to debate his political
beliefs and attitudes with Governor
Rockefeller. It was a significant
refusal. In his earlier freewheeling
days Senator Goldwater was very
free with opinions and they
covered a remarkable number of
subjects. For instance, he has
advocated US withdrawal from the
UN, an invasion of Cuba by US
Marines to restore the Guantanamo
Naval Base water supply, and
renewal of U 2 spying flights over
Russia. He is on record as oppos-
ing Civil Rights legislation, the
Government - owned TVA and
graduated income tax. As recently
as last week he said that Viet Cong
supply trails in North Vietnam
could be uncovered through “de-
foliation of the forests by low-
yield atomic weapons”. Later he
said that it “could”, not necessarily
“should”, be done.
While it is true that he has
qualified even flatly denied
many of his more impulsive
political statements and while,
especially in US politics, much
may be said but not meant by a
political candidate anxious to
gather as wide ranging support as
possible, the fact remains that
Senator Goldwater has spread him-
self very vehemently on a vast
range of political questions. He
is either ruinously impulsive or
singlemindedly opportunistic. Bar-
ring either a political miracle or
catastrophe depending on one’s
point of view—it seems impossible
that Senator Goldwater could beat
President Johnson in the Presiden-
tial vote.
Representing the “dinosaur”
wing of the Republican Party,
Goldwater’s strength comes at
best from the western and south-
ern States. He has no great follow-
ing in urban areas and it is doubt-
ful, despite ambiguous support
from Eisenhower, that he could
carry the middle of the road Re-
publican voter on many issues. The
real political problem posed by
Goldwater is certainly not as a
Presidential threat but as leader of
a divided Republican Party at a
time when the US is in great need
of a strong two-party system.


THIS AUSTRALIA
SECTS
The Nazi Party
In search of publicity
FROM PETER COLEMAN IN SYDNEY
ADOLF HITLER
In Charlotte Street
groups of 10 or 12 people have
A managed to gain as much free
publicity as the Australian National
Socialist Party of Charlotte St., Ashfield,
Sydney. No sooner had the programme
about it appeared on the ABC’s recent
“Four Corners” than ’phones started
humming all over the country, complaints
were lodged and deputations prepared.
Those who complained, however, played
straight into the hands of people they
attacked. Without publicity Australia’s
Nazis can only thrash about in total in-
significance, interrupted by the occasional
appearance of some of them in the Police
Courts on some offence or other.
Their main speaker, apart from “the
Leader'’, on the ABC’s programme, for
example, has 22 convictions for offences
ranging from grievous bodily harm and
breaking and entering to exhibiting
indecent photographs (which was the
cause of his last conviction; he was only
released from gaol earlier this year after
a six months’ sentence).
Another “prominent Nazi”, who has
four convictions, did not appear in the
ABC programme because he is now in
gaol for three years, having been found
guilty in February of 16 false pretences
charges involving £582 (defrauded from
those who, in the words of the Judge,
“could ill afford to lose any money and
were left disappointed and heartbroken”).
Another of the Nazis comes from New
Zealand where he served three years for
manslaughter.
. The group has already had an “active”
political career. One of them, Brian
Henry Raven, was a frequent speaker
for the Communist Party in the Sydney
Domain in the early 19505. (It is this
link which has given rise to the theory
that the Nazis are being financed by the
Communist Party in order to provide
the Communists with material for phony
anti-Fascist campaigns.) Raven also ap-
peared on the atheists’ soapbox in the
Domain.
But Australian Nazism really grew out
of the ruins of the ultra-nationalist Aus-
tralian Party launched in 1955 by Mr
Frank Browne, who had recently been
in prison for contempt of Parliament and
who has since given up his political
career. His lieutenants included the
leader of the current National Socialist
Party, Mr Arthur Charles Smith, and
Smith's “Commandant-General, Storm-
troops”, Brian Henry Raven. Another
activist was Mr Graeme Theo Royce.
When Browne abandoned the Aus-
tralian Party, Smith, Royce and Raven
formed the Australian Nationalist Work-
ers’ Party. With the same sort of flair at
exploiting news media as they showed
when getting time on the ABC, they
made the headlines when they announc-
ed they were inviting US Nazi leader
Lincoln Rockwell here from America.
The Federal Government announced
Rockwell would get no visa, but since the
Australian Nazis had no funds it is most
unlikely they had any serious intention of
bringing him here. But they got pub-
licity, which was the main object.
of that party grew the National
” Socialist Party. (Royce being in
prison is not in it.) This party first came
into the news last month when one of its
former leaders, Mr Donald Lindsay, told
the Sydney “Sunday Telegraph” about its
purchases of jackboots and swastikas
from disposal stores and from England.
He said the Party’s membership was
about 12 and he added: “Don’t give them
any publicity. Every time they get pub-
licity they clip out the story and send
it to Rockwell in America.”
But it would possibly never have been
heard of again had not it won precious
minutes on the ABC, which gave us the
privilege of seeing Commandant-General,
Stormtroops, Brian Henry Raven, give
the Nazi salute to a half-dozen creeps
who had presumably been drummed up
for the occasion, and go on to say:
“Heil Hitler. Good evening ladies and
gentlemen and fellow National Social-
ists. Brotherhood is for mongrelisers,
not for National Socialists who are
proud, instinctively proud of having a
race that they can call their own. But
how many of us now are cowards that
we talk in terms of Asiatics, Negroes,
apartheid? All of these things we’re
speaking about every day, but we’re
afraid, mortally afraid, speaking on
general principles, mortally afraid to
express our true desires regarding our
own race. Afraid —why, why? Because
we’ve been conditioned to believe that
brotherhood is the only way of survival
throughout the world. These things are
not true. The Leader of the National
Socialist Party of Australia is one of the
few people who has stood up for many,
many years, and fought in the interests
of the white people our Leader, Mr
Arthur C. Smith!”
Leader Smith (a “spotter” in a Hurl-
stone Park laundry; he looks for grease
spots) is the most ideology-conscious of
the group. He explained, with the full
repertoire of Hitler’s gestures:
“I am extremely pleased to see so
many young faces in our audience be-
cause, fundamentally, National Socialism
is a political creed, a political philosophy,
not for the old and the have-beens, but
for the youth and the young people of
our nation. We’re not ashamed to get
up and say ‘Young people of Aus-
tralia, we need you. Young people of
Australia, we want you’, because Aus-
tralia does, and we one day will represent
Australia. If the nation stands firm and
united with one will, with one desire
that the nation is first and foremost
nothing can smash us, nothing can
destroy us. Eleven million people in Aus-
tralia can stand worthily tomorrow and
face the opposition of a hundred million
people to the north of Australia these
people present no problem in any case.
The problem is not the outside masses
of colored peoples, the problem is those
people within our own country who are
white-anting the country. In every facet
of life we see them ...”
The “official objectives” of the group
are:
• The preservation and promotion to
pre-eminence of Australia as a white
race folk nation.
® The removal of Jews and non-in-
digenous coloreds.
® The restoration of national sov-
ereignty and solvency; encourage-
ment of competitive private enter-
prise; workers’ partnership in in-
dustry.


e To strive unceasingly for the libera-
tion of nations under the Jew-Com-
munist yoke of slavery and terror.”
Further comment on this sort of vile-
ness is superfluous. They have their day
in the public court. They should now
be left to police supervision which they
obviously receive and any talk of pro-
tests to the ABC is best forgotten. Pro-
test is obviously what they want.
POLITICS
The Victorian Election
- A Round -up
Why Bolte will win
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
H. BOLTE
“Told you so”
PTlhe uninterrupted run of the Bolte
Liberal Government, since the ALP
split ousted Cain Labor in 1955, has
given to Victorian politics in the past
ten years a stability previously unknown
in its history. It will not be the fault
of the Victorian ALP and the Victorian
Country Party if that stability does not
end after the pending State election on
June 27.
The political facts of life in Victoria
are that Premier Bolte has a majority
of 12 in the 66-member Legislative As-
sembly (Lower House). The Government
has 39 seats, the ALP 18, the Country
Party 9. If the Liberals lose seven seats,
the Government may be replaced either
by a Country Party Government with
ALP support, or an ALP Government
with Country Party support. A third pos-
sibility would be a coalition of the
Liberals and Country Party on the lines
operating at Canberra.
The first two of these possibilities
would be acceptable to the ALP and,
most likely, to the section of the Country
Party led by Deputy Leader Moss. The
CP leader, Sir Herbert Hyland, pro-
bably hopes for the third arrangement.
However, the hare must first be caught.
Accordingly, the ALP and Country Party
are co-operating to “dish” the Liberals.
The ALP is not contesting a number of
Country Party seats in the Legislative
Assembly and neither party is nominating
in any seat where it might spoil the
other’s prospects.
A similar arrangement operates in
the less vital, but still important, Legis-
lative Council or Upper House, where
the Liberals hold 17 seats (16 votes after
providing a President), the Country Party
8, and the ALP 9. The Opposition
parties have frequently combined to
needle the Government and hold up or
throw out legislation.
Mr. Bolte, therefore, is flat out to
win either Bendigo or Doutta Galla
province, each held by Labor, and the
only provinces where a change seems
possible. It is significant that the Country
Party has not nominated in Bendigo, a
country seat, and its full support will go
to the ALP.
The ALP has avowed its pact with the
Country Party unashamedly. State Pre-
sident R. W. Holt and Secretary W.
Hartley, as well as ALP officials in
electorates involved, have called for
ALP votes for the Country Party.
CP leader Sir Herbert Hyland has,
not very convincingly, played hard to
get and said it will be time to comment
on the Labor approaches after nomina-
tions close. Premier Bolte, who pre-
dicted the pact months ago, is saying:
“I told you so”.
DLP Leader, J. Little, has asked the
question: “After this marriage is con-
summated, who will wear the pants?”.
He also accused the Country Party,
Federally married to the Liberals in
Canberra, of contemplating bigamy with
the Victorian ALP.
The DLP, which won 17 per cent of
the votes in the last State election, is
sure, through its preferences, to exert a
decisive influence on the election. In the
1961 election, Liberal candidates needed
DLP preferences to win in 27 seats in
the Legislative Assembly. Their prefer-
ences could be vital in Ballarat South,
Broadmeadows, Dandenong, Essendon,
Evelyn, Geelong West, Mentone, Moonee
Ponds and Oakleigh, where in 1961 the
ALP candidates led on primary votes and
lost on DLP preferences.
DLP preferences will also exert strong
influence in Dundas, Geelong, Haw-
thorn, Ivanhoe, Moorabbin, Mulgrave,
Ormond, Ringwood, Ripponlea, St. Kilda,
Sandringham and Scoresby, where the
Liberal candidate led but needed some
DLP preferences.
Other seats which could be worth
watching on June 27 are the weakly-held
ALP seats of Albert Park, Bendigo,
Brunswick West, Melbourne and Mid-
lands and in other categories, Kara
Kara, Ballarat North and Morwell.
Despite the ALP-Country Party tie-
up, the Liberals are very confident. They
regard the Federal election result as a
pointer and claim that Mr Bolte is a
more popular figure than Sir Robert
Menzies. Liberal confidence is shown
by the invitations sent to Federal Liberal
Parliamentarians to participate in the
Victorian campaign. In 1961, with the
credit squeeze in operation, Bolte warned
off all Federal Liberals.
The ALP is desperate to avoid another
election disaster, which might finally
provoke Federal intervention. Hence
its arrangement with the Country Party
and the invitation to the highly regard-
ed Alan Fraser, MP, to act as public
relations man to Labor leader Clive
Stoneham. The recent rift between
unions over the Melbourne Trades Hall
secretaryship has not helped ALP
chances.
The Country Party needs some succes-
ses to bolster its steadily fading strength.
It fears too open association with the
ALP would be the kiss of death, but
needs the advantages of a clandestine
arrangement.
The arrangement is not popular with
Labor supporters in the constituencies
concerned and in the unions. In Pol-
warth, for example, the ALP original an-
nouncement that no candidate would run
has been followed by a decision to stand.
Unionists dislike the Country Party for
its anti-union attitude. All this could
limit Country Party benefit from the ar-
rangement.
The DLP is treating the election as
a referendum on its right to exist as
a minority party and is making much of
accepting Mr. A. Calwell's challenge that
it is withering on the vine. It claims
that he made a similar prophecy in 1961,
but the DLP vote rose to 17 per cent
-—its highest ever. DLP leaders, in search
of a big lift in their vote, say they are
free in Victoria to run a constructive
campaign as well as one of exposure of
the ALP. In the Federal election their
vital task was to keep the ALP out
for defence and security reasons. Their
vote will probably rise, compared with
the November Federal election, because
the DLP vote is always higher in Vic-
torian elections than in Federal elections.
The strength of the Bolte Government
is its offer of stability in Government.
Victorians had bitter experiences of
coalitions and minority governments be-
tween 1920 and 1950 and are likely to
vote for the Liberals on June 27 as the
only party likely to be able to govern in
its own right.


STATE AID
The Bishops and
Benjamin Doig
And the weekend farmer’s pamphlet
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
BEN DOIG, MLA
“Bigots got me”
npHE political mystery of the week was
A whether Evan Colin Briarcliffe Mac-
Laurin, BA, BD, MA (Cantab.) and the
author of “Origins of the Hebrew Sacri-
ficial System” had been the man who
stabbed Benjamin Cochrane Doig, MLA,
in the back by organising his defeat in
the Party pre-selection ballot, and the
automatic loss of Party endorsement for
the Western Suburbs seat of Burwood
at the next State election.
Mr Doig acted as though he thought
so. He announced his resignation from
the Liberal Party and his intention to
stand as an “independent” and to cam-
paign in favor of State Aid. Further he
told the world that “well-organised”
forces had combined to defeat him be-
cause he had come out in favor of State
Aid. For good measure he added that
the Liberal Party was “seriously split”
over State Aid and that the “Ash Street”
bigots had defeated him.
On that line of reasoning the trail of
blood led straight to E. C. B. Mac-
Laurin, lecturer-in-charge of the Depart-
ment of Semitic Studies at the University
of Sydney and Liberal Party State execu-
tive member. A weekend farmer at St
Mary’s (a town west of Sydney) he is
also a member of the Anglican diocesan
Synod. Last week a pamphlet carrying
his name and attacking State Aid pro-
posals was being circulated to voters in
Liberal pre-selection ballots.
But while it would be plausible to
end there, the truth was rather more
complicated. Liberal Party spokesmen
were quick to point out another MLA,
Ken McCaw, known to be in favor of
State Aid, had survived a ballot (and
the distribution of the pamphlet) and that
a prominent Catholic, B. Keating, had
been sought as a candidate for Goul-
burn.
What was very much behind Mr
Doig’s defeat were questions of personali-
ties rather than ideology. Doig, a Pro-
testant, had entered Parliament in 1957
after a hard pre-selection battle beating
among others, Don Jackett, who last
week defeated him. Before that he
tried for pre-selection on several occa-
sions, twice against a sitting member.
In the Legislative Assembly Mr Doig
stood out for his well researched speeches
and as a “point-of-order” taker harassing
the Government. But he lacked a sense
of political tact and made too many
enemies without realising it on his own
side of the House. He became a mem-
ber of a small “cave” in the Opposition
and incurred the enmity of two succes-
sive leaders and the tag of “intriguer”.
It was no secret that the present leader,
Mr R. Askin, disliked him. Before the
last election Mr Doig scraped in his pre-
selection by one vote. (Three votes
shifted because his nearest rival would
not agree to live in the electorate.)
Throughout the life of the current
Parliament Doig has openly referred to
his support of direct State Aid, culmina-
ting in a speech to Parliament last
October advocating direct aid for science
blocks. After a flurry within the State
party before the last State elections, the
parliamentary party had rejected in a
decisive vote direct State Aid. Over the
last year Mr Doig had been seeing
members of the Catholic hierarchy,
Bishop T. Muldoon and Bishop J.
Carroll, and the inference has been
drawn that he was talking to them about
the State Aid question. His enemies point
to this as an example of what they see as
a tendency to “intrigue”.
The Federal member covering the
area, Minister for Labor, Mr W. Mc-
Mahon, has become cool to Mr Doig,
and although he did not campaign
against him this time, kept himself
neutral. Mr Doig has been saying that
McMahon was a factor in his defeat.
On the fateful pre-selection ballot Mr
Doig got only 18 votes out of the 50,
an indication of local weakness as much
as of any headquarters disapproval.
But while the theory of an “anti-State
Aid” faction overthrowing Mr Doig can
be rejected, the status of Mr MacLaurin
still has to be assessed. Those forces in
the Liberal Party utterly opposed to any
direct aid suffered a mortal wound when
Sir Robert announced the campaign
promise for the £5 million for science
blocks.
Quietly the State Parliamentary party
earlier this year endorsed the Federal
Government policy. Mr MacLaurin has
some following but nothing like enough
to justify the defeat dealt out to Mr
Doig last week.
WAR WITH FRANCE?
ffifeuiletin
80 Years Ago: June 14, 1884
The disposition of the French
Government in relation to the
interests of the Australian colonists
must be regarded as, in the diplomatic
sense, distinctly unfriendly. There is
no manner of doubt about the danger
to which these colonists are exposed
—a renewal of the infiltration of those
bad (convict) elements which the
colonists long ago refused to receive
from their mother country. (But) to
close the ports of Australia against
the vessels of a great power, between
which and Great Britain friendly re-
lations and actual treaties of com-
merce subsist, would be a step alto-
gether too momentous to be accom-
plished without almost incalculable
results.
The tone which these (anti-French)
persons wish Europe to believe is the
true ring of the voice of Australia is
not really a manly one. It is the
expression of a bumptious small boy,
who threatens all who aggrieve him
with the wrath of his big brother,
Before, therefore, a rage is worked
up with respect to this recidiviste
trouble, it will be wise to settle how
far Australia is prepared to proceed
in the matter, and whether the colo-
nists are ready to make the sacrifices
which a war—possibly without Great
Britain for backer—would demand,
Protestant denominations con-
stitute a numerical majority. If
their ministers agree on a course of
action and can only keep their flocks
in hand, what is to prevent them from
making the secular schools Protestant
schools? That is the ministerial idea:
and, to secure that end, it is rumored
that churchmen and dissenters are to
be asked to unite. We don’t believe
for a moment that a majority of lay-
men will follow their pastors to the
perpetration of such a great wicked-
ness: but only think of the injustice of
the idea! If it be entertained by the
heads of the Protestant denominations
(as there is reason to believe it is),
what a commentary is the fact upon
the recent words of Dr Barry: “There
is no tyranny half so absolute as that
of the majority.”


LIBERAL PARTY
NSW Without the Boss
Spooner’s well-kept secret
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
Sir W. SPOONER
Machine man
Senator Sir William Spooner was
important politically in two ways.
He was the Minister for National De-
velopment. He was also boss of the
Liberal machine in NSW. But despite
his importance, his resignation last week
caught the Press napping. It was one
of the best kept secrets for a long time.
If any Pressman knew about it before
the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
broke the news in an official announce-
ment on Tuesday night, he had kept it
to himself —an unlikely happening.
Obviously from the statement Lady
Spooner herself has since made, Senator
Spooner made up his mind some time
ago to retire to the back benches of the
Senate, shedding both his Ministerial
responsibility and Government leader-
ship of the Senate.
Filling Spooner’s official posts as
Minister for National Development and
Government Senate Leader is in some
ways less important than the filling of his
position as Liberal machine boss in
NSW. It was this position that gave
Spooner much of his strength. Though
the Liberal machine has been ineffectual
hitherto in the State arena it has been
most effective Federally.
Spooner was adviser to Menzies as
far as NSW was concerned. For ex-
ample, which New South Welshman was
to be promoted to the Ministry? Men-
zies invariably consulted Spooner. He
might not always have approved his
advice, but there is reason to believe
that Menzies seldom went flatly in oppo-
sition to it. Menzies might not always
select the man Spooner wanted. But he
seldom promoted the man whom
Spooner did not want.
Spooner also acted as the buffer be-
tween Menzies and the NSW machine.
If the NSW machine had a grievance it
was Spooner who tried to get it fixed.
The man who received his nod of ap-
proval could expect to go some distance
■a the Liberal Party in NSW. Those
whom he regarded as of dubious value
seldom made much headway.
It is not easy to see anyone now in
the Federal Ministry inheriting his
Power. Labor Minister William Mc-
Mahon is possibly the only one who
could. McMahon, a bachelor, lives for
politics. But he was overseas when
Spooner announced his resignation and
by the time he gets back, about a month
hence, he might be starting behind
scratch.
There are many on the State side of
Liberal politics who would prefer to see
one of themselves rather than a Federal
Minister as the effective boss of the
NSW Liberal machine.
The other Liberal Federal Ministers
from NSW—Supply Minister Fairhall,
Air Minister Fairbairn, and Housing
Minister Bury—are hardly the types you
can visualise as operating a machine,
though Fairhall could possibly develop
a talent in this direction.
Spooner's departure from the higher
political echelons makes Menzies’ supre-
macy even loftier. For a while at least,
until somebody picks up the reins that
Spooner has dropped, there just is not
any NSW force Federally.
DEFENCE
The RAAF Base Without Guards
“If we had been saboteurs ...”
FROM GRAHAM P. MORRIS IN LAUNCESTON
Tf the measures of security taken by
A the Fairbairn RAAF base at Can-
berra are an example of the safety pre-
cautions in operation in Australia
against sabotage and invasion, we are
sitting ducks for aggressors!
At 11.15 p.m. on March 23, 1964,
I accompanied several friends on a car
trip from the national capital to the
Fairbairn Air Base. We turned down
the road entrance to the RAAF base
and drove up to the guard house, where
bar barriers cross the inlet and outlet
roads. A youthful guard came out of
the guard house as we approached and
lifted the barrier without challenging
us and signalled us to go on.
However, we stopped and asked direc-
tions to the Department of Civil Avia-
tion control tower which is stationed at
the air base and waited for two or three
minutes while he went inside and
obligingly rang through to another
section of the base to ask for directions
for us. He obviously was not sure
where the control tower was located.
He came back and gave us the directions
and we proceeded through rows of
RAAF quarters until we came to a small
sign on the road announcing that cars
could go no further.
We got out and walked along the
row of huge hangars until we arrived
at the last one in the row and went
through a doorway and up several flights
of stairs to the control room. Although
the lights were on, and a teleprinter
working we saw no sign of any life.
We called out several times, but got
no reply. We then walked back down
the stairs and through another passage-
way into a hangar attached to the
control tower.
Here we saw four jet training aircraft
in their berths and inside other hangars
and outside another, we inspected four
large prop-jet VIP aircraft lined up. We
walked under and around the planes to
have a close look at them, but although
the lights were on in most of the
hangars, we still saw no sign of life.
At 11.45 p.m. we returned to the
car and drove back out through the
RAAF quarters and another guard
came out of the guard house to raise
the boom and allow us to pass. As we
were driving out, we noticed another car
pull in to one of the quarters and we
also observed two officers talking out-
side what appeared to be the officers’
mess.
What does all this prove? Simply that
if we had been interested in blowing
the Fairbairn Air Base sky-high we
could have done so and got away with
it. We were not searched, or questioned
as to our reason for visiting the base at
such an hour. We could well have been
international agents intent on planting
explosives on the VIP aircraft, or on
the jet-trainers. We could have been
anything and have done just as we
liked. No matter if we had been caught,
several millions of pounds worth of
damage and severe loss of life could
have resulted, had we been bent on
sabotage or revenge.

ABORIGINES
How to Drink
“To teach the natives ”
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
West Australia has edged carefully
"" into a position where it may finally
concede the right to drink to Aborigines.
The man piloting the measure is
Native Welfare Minister Edgar Lewis,
a down-to-earth farmer who points out
that the biggest polling point in his elec-
torate is Moora, which has the biggest
concentration of natives in the State's
south-west land division. “I think this
is a measure of my confidence,” he says.
Recently officers of his Department
began handing out to the 7000 natives
in the area illustrated booklets which will
back up an intensive education cam-
paign on the responsibilities that go with
the new rights. As an added backstop,
local police are to continue co-operating
in their “bottle ban”. This so-called
voluntary ban leaves it to the publican’s
discretion to refuse to serve bottles to
customers, black or white.
The booklet that is the pivot of the
campaign shows copybook families
which, Minister Lewis admits, “depict
natives at a more advanced stage than
they are now.” The literature plays on
their pride in their race, and urges them
to prove they can behave as well as the
white man.
CIVIL RIGHTS
A Night in Gaol
Clause 6A
From a Melbourne Correspondent
Tn Victoria there is no simple pocket
guide to the rights of the citizen in
relation to the police, similar to the one
published in NSW recently (see The
Bulletin, May 23). The -mistake com-
mitted by Mrs Dorothy Quantrill in
Bourke Street last week indicates that
a Victorian edition might be needed.
Mrs Quantrill, 48, an English migrant
now living at East Malvern, appeared
in the City Court last week after spend-
ing five hours of the previous night in
the lock-up for failing to give her name
and address to a policeman. It tran-
spired that Mrs Quantrill was seen by
Constable Maurice Lindsay to cross
Bourke Street against a “Don’t Walk”
sign at 5.20 p.m. He spoke to her, and
Mrs. Quantrill explained she was in a
hurry to catch a train. However, Con-
stable Lindsay told the Court she re-
fused requests for her name and address.
Constable Lindsay thereupon arrested
her and she was held in the lockup from
5.30 until 10.30 p.m. Next day she
appeared in Court on charges of having
failed to observe and comply with a
traffic control signal and of failing to
give her name and address to a police-
man. In Court she said, “I didn’t give
my name and address because I didn’t
like the way the constable treated me.
He got hold of my arm and treated me
roughly.”
Chief Stipendiary Magistrate Mar-
wick told Mrs Quantrill she could have
avoided her hours in the cells by giving
her name and address. He placed her on
a £lO good behavior bond.
Legal authorities said that Constable
Lindsay was quite within his powers
under Clause 6A of the Road Traffic
Act. This provides that any policeman
may, without warrant, arrest any citizen
whom he considers to have committed
an offence against the Act and its
regulations “or who, upon being re-
quested to give his name and address,
refuses or fails to do so, or gives a
name and address reasonably suspected
to be false”.
EDUCATION
Red Universities?
“The Crucible ”
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Tntended as an exposure of Communist
infiltration of Australian universities
and at times verging on McCarthyism,
the Australian National University’s
Labor Club recently published an en-
larged issue of its roneod broadsheet
“The Crucible” and distributed it to
leading newspapers and journals.
Liberally sprinkled with names of
well-known academics (such as Dr R.
A. Gollan, Senior Research Fellow in
History, ANU; Dr E. Fry, Senior Lec-
turer in History, ANU; Bede Nairn,
Associate Professor of History, Univer-
sity of NSW; Dr J. Playford and Dr I.
Turner, Monash University), “Crucible”
outlines what it purports to be a Com-
munist takeover of the Australian Society
for the Study of Labor History.
Formed some three years ago this
Society (the ASSLH) includes among its
400-odd members a large number of
academics as well as independent his-
torians. There are also some 40 MPs
including A. Calwell, G. Whitlam, Pre-
mier J. D. Renshaw, some members of
the Liberal Party, a number of overseas
scholars, some Communists, and Mr
B. A. Santamaria.
“Crucible” builds up quite a good case
and quotes certain Communist publica-
tions to support it. It also, unfortu-
nately, quotes from private correspond-
ence between the Society’s president,
Dr Fry, and its secretary-treasurer, Mr
B. D. Shields, archivist at the ANU. It
reflects on the motives of a number of
academics: “(The Communists) obtained
the co-operation of intellectuals, some
of them ex-Communists who knew the
Communists involved and who, one
would think, would be aware of the ways
in which Communist Party cadres work”.
The facts are that some Communists
did attempt to influence the ASSLH and
this was recognised some months ago
by the Sydney chairman, Bede Nairn,
and secretary, Fred Wells. While the
ANU Labor Club was printing “Cru-
cible”, Fry, Gollan, Nairn, McFarlane,
Wells and J. Hagan were meeting in
Sydney to discuss, amongst other Society
business, the Communist manoeuvre.
Before “Crucible” had been distributed
the manoeuvre had been recognised, dis-
cussed, acted on and eliminated. A de-
cision had been taken to inform the
membership of this and any similar
Communist tactic in the future.
The general opinion is that “Crucible”
did not check on all its facts.


OVERSEAS
Filling the Great Gap
Everyone knew Kamaraj had rigged it for Shastri ...
From CYRIL DUNN in New Delhi
XpvERY political gossip in Delhi has
knowm from the start that Kumara-
wami Kamaraj, the Congress Party pre-
sident, was rigging the choice of Lai
Bahadur Shastri as Nehru's stop-gap
successor. Some people have talked
about this compromise w'ith the demo-
cratic process with amused indifference,
even with a kind of pride, as if it
showed that India had become politically
mature.
But the election of Shastri required
that some democratic formalities should
be observed, and this meant that
Kamaraj and Shastri had to appear in
public side by side. This sudden vision
of reality must have caused certain
stirrings of dismay, for it seemed ludi-
crously obvious that Kamaraj was the
real man of power, with Shastri almost
eagerly subservient to him.
There are Indians who hoped that in
this crisis the office of Prime Minister
would be cut down to size, but did they
imagine it this size? The picture of a
ventriloquist and his doll was, of course,
inaccurate and misleading. The trouble
is that in both Kamaraj and Shastri there
is an uncommon accord between per-
sonality and physique. Shastri is amiable,
submissive and small, looking most of
the time as if he hopes he is giving no
trouble to anyone. Kamaraj is immensely
commanding, self-confident and physi-
cally powerful, with the incredibly pene-
trating eyes and thick-lipped scow'l of
an antique South Indian sultan.
On the day of the great election every-
thing combined mercilessly to exaggerate
this contrast. Shastri came into the great
round courtyard of Parliament followed
by a chance crowd w'ho treated him as
a happy kind of joke, w'hich he seemed
cheerfully to share. Kamaraj tramped
in looking severe, with a company of
adherents tight packed at his heels, con-
forming to his own fast pace, walking
not exactly in step but as if they shared
a common set of legs. This is a normal
tribute paid to greatness in the East.
To the parliamentary party Shastri
made a trite little speech—though it had
a suddenly moving stretch when he
choked over the name of Nehru's
daughter—which seemed likely to end
with him declaring the sale of work
open. At his first Press conference that
same night Shastri was asked a cunning
question about his Cabinet-making. He
replied' innocently and, as it happens,
sensibly, “It is for Mr Kamaraj to de-
cide that matter.” There was at once a
hoot of derisive laughter.
Tt had been apparent from the begin-
ning that Indian reporters w ; ere not
treating Shastri with the awed respect
they had always show'n towards Nehru.
But after his supposed gaffe about Kama-
raj some of them began openly pulling
his small leg as they would never have
dared pull Nehru’s Far from being
affronted, Shastri entered joyfully into
the spirit of the thing, and began ex-
changing with the Press private jokes
about ambitious ministers and certain
esoteric goings-on in Uttar Pradesh.
It was on Shastri's part a display of
contented self-possession, possible only in
someone who had prepared himself in
advance for circumstances which he
knew would be trying and might well
make his part in them look dubious. It
then began to appear that Shastri's share
in current events is not dubious at all
but, in a curious way, heroic. For he
must have known better than anyone
else that as Nehru’s successor he could
hope to cut no great figure in the eyes
of those who had idolised Panditji, and
that, simply because of his physical limi-
tations, he might even appear absurd.
Yet he was ready to go through with
it, perhaps because he guessed nobody
else would—fearing damage to their
dignity and future prospects —and be-
cause the job seemed to have a stop-gap
character necessary to India's immedi-
ate safety and in keeping wfith Shastri's
exaggerated view of his own inadequa-
cies.
As one who has no real experience of
foreign parts Shastri is naturally most
interested in domestic affairs. He has
been chattering away happily, his eyes
blinking, about rising prices and the
need to curb them, about his desire for
“a new social order in w'hich the few do
not monopolise the wealth w'hile others
suffer” —a perhaps absent-minded reflec-
tion on the massive change already
thought to have been brought by Nehru.
Shastri comes from a caste of clerks

in Uttar Pradesh—his close friend Jaya-
prakash Narayan also belongs to it—
and was for a long time exactly the kind
of impoverished intellectual who in Eng-
land helped to foster the Labor move-
ment.
On foreign affairs he is often halting
and unsure of himself, but he is a natural
peace-maker; it belongs to his tempera-
ment. It may be that an accommodation
with China is outside his scope, and is
in any event not available. Why, after
all, should Peking offer any kind of
helping hand when Delhi is so obviously
on a tightrope of change?
But Shastri has welcomed Pakistan
President Ayub Khan's offer of closer
understanding in a tone which seemed
to have a ring of sincerity not previously
heard in these parts. He has already
had to do with the problem of Kashmir
•—it was Shastri who brought about the
release of Sheikh Abdullah. The Nagas
need not suppose that they have a new
enemy in Shastri. It seems unlikely that
he would willingly affront his friend
Narayan, whom he deeply admires, by
working against the current hopes of a
decent settlement in Nagaland.
The warring Congress barons
may all be empty hopes if Kama-
raj truly regards Shastri as a tem-
porary expedient, to be disposed of
whenever it seems the post-Nehru danger
period is over. Nobody here thinks that
Kamaraj looks on Shastri as permanent.
Kamaraj is a politician who recognises
the importance of power, and who can-
not seriously consider Shastri a powerful
figure, though one imagines the South
Indian is the sort of man who is willing
to be surprised.
It must also be supposed he has no
personal love for the form of Indian
society whose class divisions made Nehru
a natural aristocrat. Kamaraj has battled
his way to his present eminence from
boyhood in a South Indian community
only by a fraction less despised than the
Untouchables.
Shastri may, in fact, have more power
than he realises. He can hope to com-
mand the affections of the Indian masses
because he is a devout Hindu and a
good man. He tries to practise in his
private life the simplicities ordained by
his religion. He meditates; he worships
idols, not in any pagan way, but as a
means of concentrating upon obscuri-
ties in the Vedantic philosophy. He has
a long record of self-denying service to
the Indian people.
In addition, he is necessary to the war-
ring Congress barons, even to those who
now privately ridicule him. For as a
stop-gap Prime Minister it is his job to
hold the kingdom together until the
times seem more auspicious for the
others to fight for the throne.

reveal those unexpected attributes of
leadership which have appeared in stop-
gaps before, it is conceivable that Kama-
raj might allow him more future than
he seems to have at the moment, (ofns)
From Bombay A. K. MUKERJI writes:
VTo astrologer is known to have fore-
seen any extraordinary future for
Lai Bahadur Shastri, the new Prime
Minister of India, when he was born 59
years ago on October 2 (Mahatma Gan-
dhi’s birthday). His father was a school-
teacher in Ramnagar, near the holy city
of Benares (now called Varanasi). A
combination of circumstances pushed
him to the fore as the successor to the
charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru.
Despite Mr Shastri’s self-effacing qua-
lities, it was no accident that he was
chosen by the high command of the
Indian National Congress when Mr
Nehru’s sudden illness last January
forced it to think of someone who could
take part of the burden off the shoulders
of the ailing Prime Minister.
Among the half-dozen top-ranking
leaders, some more senior in the party
hierarchy, as well as better known and
even more distinguished in some re-
spects, who had several months earlier
left the Central Government under the
Kamaraj Plan for drafting senior leaders
to party work with a view to revitalising
the Congress, Mr Shastri alone could be
chosen unopposed (after negotiation) for
re-entry into the Nehru Cabinet.
A “centrist”, roughly speaking, Mr
Shastri was a tolerable, if not the ideal
choice, to the Left in the party to whom
it was a point in his favor that he had
enthusiastically rallied behind the Con-
gress Party resolution on. socialism and
democracy. To the Congress Party’s
Right he apparently commended himself
as someone who had never been formally
associated with any group of socialists
either inside or outside the party. To
some extent Mr Shastri’s naturally self-
effacing personality and pleasing man-
ners, and even more his penchant for
scrupulously avoiding dogmatic postures
were perhaps additional reasons reinfor-
cing the support he won as a “centrist”.
The choice that has fallen on frail,
slight Mr Shastri (barely five feet tall, he
is almost as short at Mr Nehru was) is
the culmination of his record of over
40 years of public work. The story
opens back in 1920 when, as a boy of
16 studying at the Harish Chandra High
School of Benares, Shastri was drawn
into the vortex of Mahatma Gandhi's
non-co-operation movement. The plunge
led to his arrest but presumably because
of his tender age he was let off after a
few hours’ detention.
There was no question of his going
back to school, since the boycott of
British-run or financed schools was a
part of the non-co-operation movement.
So he joined the Lok Sewak Mandal, a
body devoted to social service. A few
years later Shastri resumed his studies
when Kashi Vidyapith was formed as
one of the National Universities set up
for taking care of the youths whose stu-
dies had been interrupted by the boycott.
At 22 or 23 he graduated as a “Shastri”
(equivalent to BA) with philosophy (the
accent was on modern philosophy) as his
principle subject. He has been called
Mr Shastri ever since then.
After leaving Kashi Vidyapith, Sha-
stri shifted to Allahabad to become a
wholetime worker of the Servants of
People Society. Work in the Congress
Party thereafter brought him in close
touch with Nehru and soon established
a rare degree of rapport between the
two.
Mr Shastri’s first taste of imprison-
ment came during the Civil Disobedience
Movement in 1931 and then during the
1940 Individual Satyagraha and the 1942
“Quit India Movement”. In 1937 he
was drafted as a Minister in the Congress
Government in his home State that was
formed in pursuance of the Congress
Party’s 1936 decision on office accept-
ance in the Provinces. He retained the
office till 1940 when the Congress Gov-
ernments submitted their resignations. In
1946, after the Congress returned to
office, he took up the Home Minister’s
portfolio in Uttar-Pradesh. In 1951 Mr
Shastri became the general secretary of
the Indian National Congress. Mr
Nehru was then both Prime Minister and
president of his party.
The new assignment was a test of
Mr Shastri’s mettle, as he was responsible
for the screening and selection of over
3000 Congress Party candidates for free
India’s first general election. A measure
of the success he attained was that, al-
though he had the onerous duty of weed-
ing out a large number of applicants,
there was, as far as is known, no ill will
against him. His reputation was made
as a co-ordinator and compromiser and
as a constructive realist winning his point
through sheer affability.
This reputation was to be further
strengthened, when, taking over as Home
Minister on the death of Govind Ballabh
Pant, Mr Shastri piloted the highly con-
troversial Official Language Bill through
India’s Parliament. The strong moral
streak in Mr Shastri (who is firmly reli-
gious, though in a non-ritualistic sense,
a fact that distinguishes him from Mr
Nehru) was highlighted when within a
year of taking over in 1952 as Railway
Minister in Nehru's Cabinet he took the
onus of responsibility for a major rail-
way accident for which he was in no way
directly responsible and resigned his post.
Delivering the goods
A fter the last general election two
years ago, Mr Shastri returned to the
Home portfolio which he held till his re-
signation some months ago under the
Kamaraj Plan. During his tenure of this
key Ministry, he combined firmness with
gentle parsuasion. Outstanding examples
of this are his handling of the difficult
language riots in Assam, the volatile
religio-linguistic agitation of the Sikhs
in Punjab and the Congress-Praja Socia-
list Party tangle in Kerala, the last of
which he neatly unwound by shifting the
State’s PSP Chief Minister to Punjab as
its Governor.
The latest in the list of his successes in
this category is the changeover in recent
weeks in the Government of Kashmir
where the Cabinet, headed by Mr Sham-
suddin, a nominee of the Kashmir
National Conference's strongman, Bak-
shi Ghulam Mohammad, has quietly
been replaced on Shastri’s intervention
with one headed by Mr G. M. Sadiq,
whose name the Bakshi was himself per-
suaded to propose.
A secret of Mr Shastri’s success so far
is his ability to promote through a pains-
taking exchange of ideas —often while
engaged in having a constitutional —the
emergence of his own solutions as those
of the parties tackled by him.
Can Mr Shastri deliver the goods? The
answer to this question obviously lies in
the lap of the future. All that can be
said with some certainty is that until very
recently Mr Shastri’s forte lay in playing
the role of the second man, of the king-
maker rather than of the king.
Mr Shastri’s emergence as the succes-
sor to Mr Nehru is an intimation of an
important transition in the Indian politi-
cal scene. The future of India’s leader-
ship is steadily passing on to men outside
the fold of the products of the tradi-
tional universities of pre-independence
India and the West.
The transition might make for a cer-
tain loss of gloss and glamor. The new
men may not be able to speak or write
the English language with the knowledge
and sophistication of some of the pre-
sent-day leaders; they may even be some-
what pedestrian in their outlook. But
they have the asset of a strong loyalty
to the basic ideas of democracy imbibed
through 16 years of India’s indepen-
dence.


Soekarno
and the
Communist
Party
Marxism without Atheism?
From ALEX JOSEY
in Singapore
DR Ruslan Abulgani, Indonesia’s
Minister for Information, has
described Guided Democracy as
“Soekarnoism: Marxism without Athe-
ism”. There are good reasons for be-
lieving that Dr Ruslan Abulgani, back
in favor again, stated no more than the
facts.
On May 23, the Communist Party of
Indonesia celebrated its 44th anniver-
sary, and Dr Subandrio, the Foreign
Minister, sent the PKI a congratulatory
message and remarked upon the fact
that the PKI had always implemented
President Soekarno’s teachings militantly.
Significantly, President Soekarno him-
self, engaged at the time with delicate
behind-the-scene discussions and moves
aimed at bringing about a meeting with
Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia’s Pre-
mier, was, on this occasion, silent. But
nobody aware of events questions Soe-
karno’s close friendship with the PKI.
Besides, it is well known that Dr Suban-
drio does not make important comments
without President Soekarno’s knowledge
and approval.
At 44, the Partai Kommunist Indone-
sia is the oldest Communist party in
Asia. It came into being when the ISDV
(Social Democratic Association of the
Indies), the first Marxist organisation in
the history of South-east Asia, changed
its name and became the Communist
Party of Indonesia.
Not until almost exactly ten years
later, in April, 1930, was the Malayan
Communist Party formed, with Indo-
nesian assistance, and the help of the
Soviet agent Ho Chi Minh, later to
become president of the Republic of
Vietnam.
Semaun was the first chairman of the
PKI. A year or so ago I interviewed
him in Djakarta, in his home. Getting
on for 70, he was more interested in his
grandchildren than politics. He lives on
the government’s payroll as a presi-
dential adviser.
To mark the 44th anniversary of the
PKI, the party revealed their plans for
the future.
They have been set out in a document
published as the 44th Anniversary The-
sis, by the Political Bureau of the Cen-
tral Committee.
Hidden in the usual Communist ter-
minology is the firm intention to (a) sup-
port President Soekarno; (b) organise
the peasants; (c) exploit the crush
Malaysia movement.
This will mean the PKI maintaining
constant pressure on President Soekarno
to include Communists in the Cabinet,
while publicly supporting and praising
the President. This is already being
done in subtle manner. President Soe-
karno is now being credited by the PKI
with having thought up the idea of
NASAKOM (co-operation between
nationalists, religious groups and Com-
munists), in 1926.
President Soekarno is also being cre-
dited with having produced the Politi-
cal Manifesto, whereas I happen to know
for a fact that the original draft was in
Aidit’s handwriting.
The PKl’s powerful support for the
Political Manifesto is, therefore, under-
standable. Five years have passed since
it was proclaimed Indonesia’s basic poli-
tical document. Few of the hopes con-
tained therein have been realised. Now
the PKI Politbureau has demanded
again: “Implement the Manifesto and
solve the economic problems!”
In detail, the Politbureau calls for
“imperialists, landlords, capitalists and
the remnants of feudalism” to be swept
away. This must be accompanied by
a “radical agrarian reform” in the inter-
ests of the peasants. “Efforts to over-
come economic difficulties will fail
otherwise”.
What is clear from the PKI 44th
anniversary thesis is that the PKI is
THE PKI VOW

determined to continue to work through
President Soekarno, and' popular united
fronts created by him, to bring about
a Communist revolt in Indonesia through
peaceful means.
There is evidence to support the con-
tention that President Soekarno is aware
of this plan, and encourages Aidit and
his friends.
D. N. Aidit came into President Soe-
karno’s life during the war. Until 1926
the PKI had been a legal party. Then
came the people’s revolt against the
colonialist regime. Ruthlessly the Dutch
suppressed the revolt. Thousands of
Communists were sent to jail: some
were hanged, many exiled. A few lead-
ers escaped abroad. For the next 19
years the PKI operated underground.
For all practical purposes the party dis-
appeared to emerge again at the end of
1945, after the declaration of independ-
ence. Then the party was revived with
a membership of 2000.
Aidit joined the PKI in 1943, when
he was 20. He had been a nationalist
youth leader: he had been to a com-
mercial school and had never worked.
He was a politician when he was 16.
He joined the PKI “because it was
resolutely anti-Japanese”. During the
war the PKI was largely ineffective, but
always anti-Japanese. After the war
the party was respected because it had
never collaborated.
Tn 1944, the Japanese opened a political
A institution in Djakarta where selec-
ted students were indoctrinated with
Communist ideology. This astonishing
move was made by intriguing Japanese
preparing for the possibility of defeat.
They wanted Indonesia to be independ-
ent if it could not be Japanese. They
wanted to be sure that the Dutch never
returned. They reasoned that an inde-
pendent nationalist Communist Indo-
nesia would probably resist both Soviet
and American influence. That was the
intention behind the establishment of a
school for Communists. Desperately,
Japan sought to exploit the Marxist-
nationalist sentiment which has always
permeated Indonesia’s independence
movement.
Soekarno, Dr. Hatta, the Socialist
leader Sutan Sjharir taught at this poli-
tical institution, not as Communists but
as nationalists. Aidit was among the
students. Later he could claim that
President Soekarno was among his poli-
tical teachers.
Aidit was 22 when he and Chaerul
Saleh, now Minister for Basic Industries,
Wikana and two other impatient young
nationalists persuaded Soekarno, at the
point of a gun some people say, to sign
a document proclaiming Indonesia’s in-
dependence.
Soekarno was hesitating. In the PKFs

own publication, “40 Years of the PKI”,
Aidit is said to have “urged” Soekarno.
Whatever the method used, there is no
doubt that Aidit was as eager 19 years
ago to make Indonesia a Communist
State as he is today. Why Soekarno
hesitated to declare independence has
never been revealed. Some sources say.
he awaited a signal from the Japanese.
What is a fact is that Aidit’s close
relationship with Soekarno dates from
that historic occasion. Not long ago,
in his office in Djakarta, after we had
been talking, drinking coffee and eating
peanuts for more than an hour, Aidit
gave me a document which, he said,
showed President Soekarno's real atti-
tude towards the PKI.
It was a typed record of a speech the
President made, informally, at the
closing rally of the Seventh National
Congress of the PKI held on April 30,
1962.
In his speech President Soekarno
described Communists as “one of the
family in Indonesia”. He said: “If you
die I mourn your passing”. He denied
he had been responsible for “spoiling the
Communists and thus allowing the PKI
to grow from 2000 to 2,000,000 mem-
bers in 17 years.” Soekarno said that the
PKI had become very strong “because
the PKI consistently defends the work-
ers and peasants, because it consistently
stands behind the unity of Indonesia,
because it defends the have-nots”.
President Soekarno closed his speech
with these remarks: “This is my greet-
ing to the closing session of the PKl’s
Seventh Congress: ‘Go ahead! Go
ahead! Let us go forward together to
complete the Indonesian Revolution’.”
If Ruslan Abulgani's description of
Soekarnoism as “Marxism without athe-
ism'’ is correct, Aidit and Soekarno’s
common attitude towards Malaysia be-
comes easy to understand. In the 44th
aniversary thesis, the PKI Politbureau
cries: “Dissolve Malaysia and support
North Kalimantan! Smash Tunku and
support Azahari!”
May Day, in the presence of Aidit
and leaders of the Communist trade
union movement, Soekarno admitted he
encouraged Indonesian Communists. He
said he encouraged the most revolution-
ary groups, whether they are nationalists
or Communists. “So long as they are
revolutionaries Bung Karno will be their
friend,” he declared.
At this May Day rally, Soekarno in-
sisted that capitalism must be crushed.
Indonesia wanted a socialist system. He
called for unity among all the new
forces. Together they could smash the
old established forces.
Njoto, chairman of the All-Indonesian
Central Organisation of Trade Unions
(SOBSI), and a leader of the PKI, fol-
lowed. He said Indonesian workers
were solidly behind President Soekarno.
In a May Day message, the PKl's Polit-
bureau praised the Political Manifesto,
demanded support for Soekarno's efforts
to carry it out.
Two days later, in Merdeka Square,
Soekarno called “the whole world to pay
attention, to listen clearly” to his com-
mand to 21 million Indonesian “volun-
teers for the smashing of Malaysia.”
Soekarno denied he was the Hitler
of Indonesia. He had, he said, “reached
the limit of my patience, and, as Great
Leader of the Indonesian Revolution, I
order you to give all support to the
peoples of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak,
Brunei and Sabah in the smashing of
Malaysia”.
This is precisely the wording of the
PKI resolution of December, 1961,
which launched the anti-Malaysia cam-
paign.
At the rally, Soekarno said: “I will
one day recognise Kalimantan Utara as
an independent country. It is a matter
of time.”
A week later President Soekarno offi-
cially appointed Ali Hanafiah, of the
PKI, to be Indonesia's Ambassador in
Ceylon. Bonds between the PKI and
the President were reported to be
strengthening.
On May 15. the leadership of Murba,
the Proletarian Party, Trotskyists hitherto
in opposition to the PKI, called at Mer-
deka Palace. They discussed with Pre-
sident Soekarno the question of “stream-
lining Indonesia's political party system”.
They came away convinced that Soe-
karno is still working to redipe the pre-
sent ten parties to three representing
nationalists, religious groups and Com-
munists. This would then immediately
open the path to NASAKOM, a Cabinet
which would include Communists. If
this happened, the PKI would have
taken their most positive step in 44 tur-
bulent years.
Soekarno, now 64 and nearing the
end of his reign, must know this.
Guided democracy is not a serious poli-
tical philosophy. It is, as Dr Hatta says
in his book, banned by Soekarno. per-
sonal dictatorship. “Soekarno’s crea-
tion,” Dr Hatta wrote, “will not last
longer than Soekarno himself. When he
is gone tfie system will collapse auto-
matically like a pack of cards.”
Dr Hatta believes that Indonesia will
then return to democracy.
D. N. Aidit, himself a fit 41, smiling
pleasantly as always, probably feels on
this 44th anniversary of the world's third
most powerful Communist party that
he will be in a much better position to
judge the future.
Because of Soekarno's “encourage-
ment of revolutionaries” over the years,
Aidit may well prove to be right.

OUT AND ABOUT
What Makes Harry Run?
" Any jerk can find £50,000 ”
By CHARLES HIGHAM
For those who have been nostalgic
for the heyday of Lee Gordon,
New Zealand-born impresario,
Harry Miller looks at the start of his
career like providing ample solace.
Already, there are the signs of an en-
gagingly dynamic, unpredictable person-
ality: a heart-shaped advertisement bought
for Judy Garland in the Sydney Press,
with a message of love printed inside,
followed by a shocked interview (“I'll
never bring her to Australia again!”) and
then the last sentimental Show Biz
gesture of having her met and taken to
her hotel in Hong Kong after she'd fled
Melbourne’s boos for a 90-mph typhoon.
Stories about him stress Home and
Family, he Ran Away To Sea As A Boy,
married the Wrong Girl, divorced, and
now with a second marriage (“You can
call me the happiest man is Sydney”), a
snazzy new house at Edgecliff, and Big
Plans, he threatens after only a year in
the city to sweep all his competitors
aside. Threatens literally: three other
theatrical companies, he said, including
J. C. Williamson's, were falling over
each other to get Judy Garland. Finally
they clubbed together to bring her. But
I outbid the lot!
The boast is characteristic. No half-
measures here. In the crowded, junior
exec.-laden, monks’ refectory restau-
rant, full of eager girls interviewing
couples for the social columns (“You're
celebrating something? Oh no? How sad
for you!”), Harry Miller sat sideways on
his chair, took tentative nibbles of a
steak, but obviously was too carried
away to do more than faint justice to
the food. His face was about three
inches from mine, his feet propped on
the rung of my chair, his eyes alternately
snapping and dead, according to which
way the conversation was Turning, or
who was talking. The expression—a
compound of furious concentration,
ambition and an exploiter's zeal—pale
cheeks and clenched hands give some
indication of the tension of his chosen
profession. Mock modesty thrown to
the winds, talking with measured inten-
sity, he sketched in his career up to
his present age of 30.
His father, an importer, died young,
and his mother re-married. “T just
didn’t want to be at home,” he said. “I
signe d on a ship as a printer, but I
hadn't an idea how to do it. So I
learned—fast.” A New Zealander,
Miller followed his year at sea with a
j o h as office boy at Holeproof in Auck-
land. “I whizzled my way to promo-
tions. Soon I was assistant manager. I
and another guy managed to sell a mil-
lion and a quarter pairs of Zealon socks.
“Finally I found I couldn't earn the
money I wanted—l couldn’t get anybody
to pay me the salary I decided I was
worth.” He laughed. “So I decided to
hire myself. I begged and borrowed—
somehow I got the money to go to the
States. I got a degree in marketing at
the University of Georgia. They wanted
me to go and address a public relations
meeting in Tokyo when I graduated,
but I didn't have the fare.
“After nine months in America I came
back and started a record company. La
Gloria records—l started it with £lOO.
I had one record, a parody of ‘My Fatr
Lady’ with Reggie Gardiner and Zazu
Pitts. I worked in one room —a room
smaller than the guests’ washstand of
my house today.
“Gradually I started to build my own
outfit.” (Here the eyes perceptibly sharp-
ened.) “1 wrested away the pressing
rights from the other New Zealand
companies. How did Ido it? Well, I'll
tell you. I kept flying to America, to
the big record firms. I'd sit here at
the table as I'm sitting with you now and
I’d slam my fist on it. I'd tell them I
was the smallest company in New Zea-
land straight out, like that! and
then Ld say yes, but we’re the best\ —
and I'd offer them better promotion
than anyone else had thought of.
“I talked them into it— fast. Soon
I had labels like Reprise. No, it wasn't
the artists I was after. It was the label.
With a label I could get the artists on
that label to tour for me. On some, I
lost money. Johnny Ray, a classical
attraction I won’t name, the Modern
Jazz Quartet. But on others . . .
“I tell you now, I sold that record
company for a great deal of money,
and I wouldn’t touch the record business
again, not in a million years.” His steak
half eaten, Miller pushed the plate away.
Almost grey now with intensity, his
knees braced against the chair I was
sitting on, he was off again.
“I moved to Sydney in June, 1963.
I've got 17 on my staff now —eight in
Sydney, three in New Zealand, four in
Hong Kong, two in Melbourne. I’ve
brought Louis Armstrong, Shelley Ber-
man, Judy. How did I find the money
to bring these people? I tell you,
Charles, any jerk can find £50,000.
Any jerk!”
Did he, as seemed possible, see him-
self as the natural heir to Lee Gordon?
“No, it’s all different. No drugs. No
girls. Just a wife and a kid and a house.
The days of the cigar-smoking tycoon
have gone. Now it's intelligent, clear-
thinking men at the top. The old-time
Ziegfelds are out!”
And plans for the future? He chuck-
led. “A 50-hour week. But seriously,
I’ve got big plans. I want to hold a jazz
concert in Zurich. Why Zurich? It’s
a delightful spot, and not far from
Klosters if you want a week’s ski-ing. It


will be the Newport of Europe. The
Harry Miller Jazz Festival of Zurich ...”
he listened to that for a moment, and
seemed to like the sound.
Before leaving, it proved impossible to
resist asking him about Judy Garland.
Drink? Drugs? Brain damage? He
would not agree she was suffering from
these things. “But now I look back on
it, I can see the danger signals. She
kept changing from plane to car to train
when she was booking for Melbourne.
Then she wanted me to arrange a ferry
trip of the harbor for her—on Sunday
night at eight!
“She arrived in Melbourne a day late,
so the Press there didn’t get the cham-
pagne and caviar reception we had pro-
mised them. They interviewed her on
the run at the railway station. They
went hard with her. I didn’t see her
before the performance at the Festival
Hall. It was only at eight o’clock that
night I realised something had gone
wrong. She hadn't arrived. When she
hit the stage it was the strangest thing
I had ever seen. I was shocked, sick.
I had to leave the hall. I couldn't take
it any longer. And I never saw Judy
Garland again.”
The Quest for Kelly
Episode in a Black North bar-room
From LARRY BOYS in Belfast

f\ ernment man, “but Ned Kelly
-*-*• was an Ulsterman.”
The shocked look on the face of the
young Melbourne reporter was a
revelation. “I can’t believe it,” he said.
“Not Ned Kelly. He wasn’t that sort of
a man at all. He was well more
like a man from, er —”
“You mean, more like a broth of a
boy from the bogs, eh? A Croppy Boy?
A Fenian? An Irish rebel, eh! A fine,
dacent Roman Catholic IRA man? A
pistol-packing patriot with a spud on his
lip and shamrocks growing out of his
ears? Well, he was an Ulsterman. He
came from the Black North.” The last
bit, with relish.
I tried to be diplomatic by recalling
that in Kelly’s day there was no North
and South, in the modern sense.
“There’s always been a North and
South, and there always will be,” said
the Government man. “County Down
was always County Down. And it’s
there, at Banbridge, where the Kellys
were cradled. Go on, go down there
and see for yourself. It's only half an
hour’s drive. Everybody in Banbridge
knows the Kellys. Everybody.”
He even gave us a Government car
and chauffeur to take us down there.
To the quiet little greystone-and-white-
wash market town twenty-odd miles
south-west of Belfast on the Newry road.
We pulled up outside the old pub with
the sign: “William Bell & Sons, Ulster
Bar and Complete Funeral Furnishers.
Hearse for Hire.” Arid went inside.
William Bell himself, of the third or
fourth generation, said: “Ach, aye. The
Kellys of Bird Lane, we call them. Only
it wasn't Bird Lane in my father’s day.
It was The Valley. The Kellys lived
down there in a mud cabin. Clay and
wattle and a bit of thatch. And a right
rough handful they were, so it would
seem.”
Hugh McLean put his porter down
and said: “You wouldn’t take me for
eighty, would you? Well, thanks, I’ll
take a jar of the single, if you’ll con-
cede me the right to return the gesture.
Tim Feeney here knows about the
Kellys. They used to turn the horse-
shoes arsy-versy so you wouldn't know
if they were coming or going.”
“They robbed the rich to give to the
poor,” said Tim Feeney.
“It's just out the back,” said Hugh
McLean. “Behind the hotel here. Bird
Lane where the Kellys were. The tree’s
still there that they hanged them from.
The Kellys. And you know what? There
was never a leaf grew on that tree again.
Not one. Not after they hanged them.”
“They robbed the rich to give to the
poor,” said Tim Feeney. “They stole
the safe out of Finney’s next door—no
relation mind you—but there was noth-
ing in it. Nobody would go down Bird
Lane when the Kellys were there. They’d
break your head, they would, for half a
sixpence.”
“And the tree’s still there that they
hanged them on,” said Hugh McLean.
“And so is the Kelly cabin.”
Could we get a photograph?
“Not just now,” said Mr Bell. “They
filled in the Valley to make a car park.
And changed the name to Townsend
Street. You should see Bill Banbrick,
the saddler. He’s 83. He knows all
about the Kellys. He’s an authority.”
“They robbed the rich to give to the
poor,” said Tim Feeney. “And they all
got deported to Australia where they
did the same. Robbed the rich to give
to the poor.”
“And they hanged them on the tree
out the back there,” said Hugh McLean.
“And not a leaf on it to this very day.”
Three doors up from the Ulster Bar
and Undertakers, Bill Banbrick sits
among his saddles and boots and sur-
cingles and handbags and stirrups and
leather skirts. He goes about six foot
two, without a farthingsworth of fat or
stoop about him, and has a handshake
that would break your fingers it he didn’t
take care. A great leonine head on him
with a strong hawk nose and uncompro-
mising jaw. And no glasses, yet.
A smile surprisingly kind. “I suppose
you’ve been in Willie Bell’s bar,” he said.
“They do go on about the Kellys there.
You’d think they were still round the
back the way they talk. I suppose we
do take a morsel of pride in Ned Kelly.
It’s only natural.
“The old men weave a bit of a tale
or two around the Kellys. They talk as
if the entire Kelly gang decamped from
here to Australia when the place got too
hot for them.
“Actually, it was Ned's father who
went out from here. He met a County
Antrim girl out there and married her.
So young Ned was North Irish on both
sides. A good lad gone wrong. Though
it’s hard for us here to judge where the
blame lay.”
He was handstitching a woman’s
handbag down a parted seam. “We’ve
had this saddler’s shop father to son for
nigh on two hundred years,” he said.
“It’s Banbrick country as well as Kelly
country. You should get the fellows
singing. They know a few Kelly songs.”
Later, we heard one. In a thin bar-
room tenor, with a fine disregard for
historical accuracy or geographical fact:
“There’s a dear little town in old
County Down,
And it’s there that Ned Kelly was
born;
Oh, he sailed far away, out to Botany
Bay,
Far away from the Mountains of
Mourne.
In Australia’s fair land, he made his
last stand,
Though he cared not for fame or
renowns:
And like the black sheep of old, they
betrayed him for gold,
Far away from his own County
Down.”
Back in Belfast the Government man
gave us all a jar of Black Bushmill’s
whisky, from the distillery that abuts on
to the Giant’s Causeway in County
Antrim.
“Just like I told you,” he said. “Ned
Kelly was an Ulsterman.”
The Melbourne man clutched at his
very last straw. “Fair enough,” he said.
“But I’ll lay you six to four he wasn’t
an Orangeman.”


SPARE
BEDROOM
A Short Story by Marie Beare
Nineteen-forty-five it was when the Kowalski family, eager to he assimilated into a foreign way of
living, arrived in Australia from Poland. He? Forty, bald, slur-spoken, authoritative sharp eyes so brown as to
appear black, Piotr Kowalski said he had been Professor of Philosophy at Warsaw University. And she? At
twenty-two, and newly married after a courtship in a concentration camp, Wanda had a beauty that shone
through the cheap woollen clothes, the fine, long, straggly, fair hair. Her eyes, huge, hazel were trustful as a does.
At that time I was seventeen. I used
to “help” my father, a country
teacher, at the English classes
held bi-weekly in the largest school-
room. At 8 p.m. sharp, Tuesday and
Friday, the covered van that transported
twenty to thirty “Balts” arrived from the
Mental Hospital. For two hours I passed
chalks, erased, drew cats and mice and
other simple objects that came within
my scope of draughtsmanship, and
mouthed vowels and nouns and verbs to
the tired voices that mouthed back as
if we were quite, quite deaf.
“Sheep,” they loudly chanted, staring
at a blue-chalk yacht.
“Ship, ship,” I reiterated, pointing.
“Ship. -This is a sheep,” and drew a sheep
that looked rather like a curlicued fox-
terrier.
“A-ah. Ees sheep. Goott.” Beams. A
rustle of mirth.
Most of the 1945 European migrants
Were intellectuals or former professional
people: doctors, judges, musicians, chem-
ists, professors, architects, teachers.
Slavs and Scandinavians, Poles and
White Russians; involved names that
the Australian tongues could rarely twist
into semblance of euphonic decency. So
Dr and Mrs Yuzopavagis changed their
name to “West”; Bielecki was spelt in-
correctly by many Australians; Lillac,
instead of Lee-lyak, became brother to
shellac; and the dour Estonian Miirre
answered to most of his Australian work-
mates’ “Mir-you-there-hey?” Makswy-
tedc (teenage brother and sister Aldona
and Halmuth) recognised, after much
puzzlement on their parts, their pseu-
donym of “Mac,” and after their two-
years’ tenure at the Mental Hospital dis-
appeared respectively into hotel dish-
washing in Melbourne and timber-mill
cutting in Gippsland.
Two of the male migrants (a Czech
and a Ukranian) committed suicide by
poison; others, the lesser-intellectual
types, devised ways of making money
quickly. There was Stolarski, the beetling-
bowed, eternally brown-suited and brown-
hatted hulk, who worked at the Mental
Hospital by night and with a city builder
by day. Stolarski always stood up in the
morning bus to give me a seat. Over
several years he made a fortune by buy-
ing Newport blocks of land cheaply,
erecting plasto-fibrous huts, then re-sel-
ling to those migrants who were clam-
oring to have privacy over their heads
for a very small deposit. By the time a
regulation was evolved that forbade huts
a la maniere Stolarski, Stolarski had mar-
ried an Australian woman and was tour-
ing Europe. Yes, Stolarski assimilated
his surface so well that he could afford
to thumb his nose by proving nostalgia.
VTot so Wanda Kowalski. Despite the
inner sweetness that lit her small,
fragile body into attracting wolf-whistles
from the local hotel-verandah proppers,
despite youth, Wanda Kowalski could not
master the English tongue. She was very
shy. She became easily fatigued. Except
for latrine-scrubbing in concentration
camp, she had not worked before she
arrived in Australia.
But she tried as he tried, and that was
the important thing. Piotr and she rented
an unpainted, one-roomed grey hovel
that lay on the outskirts of the town. It
had been untenanted for years. They fur-
nished it meagrely (cotton-covered fruit-
cases for chairs); they made a vegetable
garden; Wanda grew a row of pink holly-
hocks that Piotr said were “the foolish.”
They built on another room and a ver-
andah, floored the lot, then painted the
building in a white that dazzled like a
penguin’s waistcoat. They had money in
the bank. Though the landlord doubled
the rent as soon as he noticed the im-
provements, the Kowalskis still saved be-
cause they were both working.
Then, by an unfortunate string of mis-
haps, Piotr, who worked as did Stolarski
at two jobs, broke his right leg and right
arm. Within three weeks his wife de-
veloped a septic throat; two days later
Antoni was born in a Melbourne public
hospital.
Antoni was a handsome child. Urged
by boredom (what is there for a teenage
girl to do on Saturday afternoons in a
country town?) and a flimsy resentment
that such pleasant people as the Kow-
alskis should have to live an uncom-
fortable sort of life, I began to visit them
each Saturday afternoon. I always took
a basket of cakes, flowers, magazines.
Wanda always insisted on filling the bas-
ket with garden-produce: peas, new po-
tatoes, a bunch of hollyhock, cress. She
gigglingly explained a recipe which in-
cluded tomatoes, onion, herbs, mince-
meat, and red capsicum. With the aid of
gestures and empty pint measures, she
bolstered my optimism into achievement;
my parents, sceptical at first, almost
choked with admiration at this new taste
that tickled the palate into hope for a
repeat effort.
To my embarrassment, the Kowalskis
always called me “Miss Marie”; and I,
too young to gap the break and knowing
that the use of European masculine and
feminine and “pet” names held subtle
formalities that I did not understand,
was unable to hurdle “Mr Kowalski”
and “Mrs Kowalski,” though I always
thought of her as Wanda. The soft name
suited her.
They paid a deposit of £350 on a

crooked; the house was condemned to
be wrecked a week before they were to
move in. Though that amount of money
must have represented two years’ de-

notice, were too distrustful of legal liti-

again. Wanda could not work, now, be-
cause of Antoni. How she loved her son!
“Dok-ter said child no again. I-child-
no-again,” she explained, patting her
stomach and looking embarrassed at
mentioning such a primitive thing as
birth. “If child die, me. Not good to
Antos, for no mother. Me, mother.” At
“mother,” she glowed.
But 19 months after Antoni’s birth
came Stanislaw. His mother didn’t die,
and the doctor said words to the effect
of, “This surprises me, but no more.
You wouldn’t have a hope.”
By way of a quaintly-worded letter,
Wanda invited me to be Stanislaw’s
godmother. By that time I lived in Mel-
bourne. The day set for the christening
was a Saturday, the first time the man
with whom I had become infatuated had
invited me to accompany him to the
cricket.
I was to meet Mr Kowalski, the god-
father (Zielinski) and the baby at the
Melbourne Town Hall at 10 a.m. Stanis-
law was quite old, about six months. I
thought it was odd that his mother did
not intend to come.
“He weell is heffy,” Wanda’s letter had
noted. “You weell not kare is true. I
lof.” She always said “lof” for “laugh.”
I endured the terrible little vestry-
seryice at the dirty little church that was
in an industrial suburb. Though the Pol-
ish race is Catholic, this church was
Greek Orthodox. Dimly I remembered
Wanda’s trying to tell me something
about her husband's originally coming
from Kiev and changing his name. Bap-
tism was by immersion. The baby
screamed. His father was not at ease.
Zielinski tried to feed soft chocolate to
the child. As it was a hot day, the brown
dribbles stained my new cream linen suit
(Magg copy). Zielinski offered me a pink
jujube that was wreathed in pocket-lining
fluff. Besides, Zielinski, whose frizzy
brown hair had always annoyed me be-
cause he drenched it with sickly perfume,
kept casting what seemed to be a know-
ing eye upon me.
T was glad when it was all over. At no
time did it occur to me that a baby
needs regular feeds, that on a hot day a
baby needs lots of fluid apart from baths,
that fathers rarely know how to tend
babies. To me, babies were as foreign
a race as Poles and most Australian
adults. Also, I swallowed a fly whilst my
godchild was clutching at my mother’s
filigree brooch. It was too much. I
heartily wished the Kowalskis could have
chosen a Polish godmother.
Actually, the ceremony didn’t take
long. I still had time to meet Norman.
It appeared, however, that I was expected
to return home with the men. “By
“tark-zee” proudly announced Kowalski,
and “tark-zee” obediently echoed Ziel-
inski. A feast; for the baby; Wanda had
stayed home to prepare the feast. I
must, must come. As little Stanislaw’s
godmother I was a VIP.
Forty miles with Zielinski’s perfume,
I thought, looking at the still-screaming
child. And Norman stood-up when /
know he’s booked for the Prince of Wales
for dinner. (I had never been to dinner
at a hotel.) So I was courteously
adamant. I even pencilled a guilty note
to Wanda: “I did not know you wished
me to come home,” said I, printing it in
big letters. “I shall come up on the
train and visit you soon. Your new son,”
I generously added, “is a lovely baby.” I
supposed he was. Certainly he was fat,
and he dribbled. I gave the silver
christening-mug to Mr Kowalski, who
bowed.
VI/'hen, two months later, I did visit
"" Wanda Kowalski, no one was home.
Then I married, and still lived in Mel-
bourne, and sent a Christmas card each
Christmas and an Easter card each Easter
in return to their card, always so for-
mally stilted - “To dear Miss Marey and
familey, with the wishes, Familey P.
Kowalski.” “We hope,” said 1961’5,
“You will to see wan day. We haf house.
Boys is big. Soon haf phone.”
They had, I noticed, moved to Broad-
meadows. One Saturday afternoon, when
my son Peter was ten months old, I
drove out to see them. It was the week
before Christmas.
The house was so neat, so white, it
put its neighbors to shame. It reminded
me of a doll's house. The garden, blue-
slate bordered, did not own a weed. Yet
somehow it seemed too neat to be a
real garden. Wanda did not seem sur-
prised to see us. Formally, graciously,
she ushered me through her house. I
felt ashamed as I recalled the untidy flat
and dish-stacked sink I had left.
The rooms, all of them, were lined
with oil paintings. “I did not know your
husband painted?” I said, surprised. “Ah,
heem. Always he must since we leev
here. Sell? Not try,” sighed Wanda. They
were strange paintings: red-toned por-
traits of mental hospital patients. Each
portrait stressed madness, not hope. No,
I could not have lived with those
paintings.
The Christmas tree was so tailored as
to be a shop-product, but no: “/ do, /
breeng to here,” smiled Wanda, caressing
a green tinsel ball. “Not good. Beeg.
Chip.” Cheap?
She said she had been sick: hospital
for three months; stomach. She looked
very shy: “Not stomark, vomb,” she
added. "Not to have Stas. Bistake. Pay
for bistake. But goot to have boy. Stas
pet name, you, me, call Wandzia. Pet
name, we like,” she explained.
It seemed that Piotr still worked as
male attendant at a Mental Hospital

You know what made the gramophone of 1905 just a squeaky noise today?
One thing, competition!
The manufacturer who does not improve his product or service to the public
to keep ahead of his competitors, fails. Competition is the driving force that is
the spur to progress.
In Australia there are many banks, each in competition for your business, with the
result that Australia has a banking service equal to the best in the world.

and Wanda, when she wasn’t being ill,
worked there too. She displayed the vege-
table garden: neatly-rowed French beans;
beetroot; pumpkin; glossy Grosse Lisse
tomatoes. Wanda’s accent had not im-
proved. She still did not understand
when I spoke quickly.
She called in her boys, and I was re-
minded of Cornelia in the old school
reader. Vaguely I remembered that Cor-
nelia's jewels were her sons, or maybe
daughters; not sapphires. Antoni and
Stanislaw were quiet boys, beautifully-
behaved. When we were leaving I drove
them around the block in my old Fiat,
and Stan laughed for joy each time we
bumped over one of the foot-deep holes
of the unmade road; Luna Park. Tony,
however, sat rigid as a poker, though his
replies were polite. Still, I knew he had
enjoyed the ride in a rattletrap. His eyes
shone when he climbed out.
I’d promised to telephone Wanda; I’d
said, “One Sunday, perhaps you could all
come swimming with us? Then have din-
ner? I’ll arrange for my husband to come
and get you. I’ll ring.” But I didn’t ring.
I was so busy: the new baby, Bill’s losing
his job and his car, Peter’s poisoned foot.
The year vanished before I had recog-
nised its introduction.
And at nine o’clock on Christmas Eve,
1962, I telephoned Wanda Kowalski.
Because I’d had ’flu I had not sent out
a Christmas card. I felt guilty. I knew
Wanda was friendly with few Australians
because she had never conquered the
language and she resented being snig-
gered at by women and whistled at by
men. Mr Kowalski answered my call.
We exchanged pleasantries of, as ever,
a formal type. It appeared he still
worked as a warder in the same Mental
Hospital. He said he liked it, “No, not
try find other job. Vork suit, money
goot.” After the fourth small silence I
asked, for the second time, “May I
speak to your wife?” “Ah, she ees in
bed,” apologised Mr Kowalski. “I’m
sorry,” I said. “It is late, I hadn’t real-
ised. I’ll ring her later in the week. I
would like to wish her a Happy New
Year, to say hello to her, I haven’t
spoken to her for a year.” “Yess, yess,”
said Mr Kowalski; not understanding?
“Hap-pee Christ-mas,” I carolled, im-
patiently wondering, “Can they never,
never learn to speak, to hear? Not even
after two decades?” “Yess,” said Mr
Kowalski, in a tone of finality that sug-
gested to me, “Of course you will not
ring. You merely become sentimental at
Christmas time.”
So I did ring. Though perhaps un-
consciously ironical, his tone had stung.
I rang the day after Boxing Day, at
3 p.ni.
“Wanda,” I intended to say (after all
these years, let’s drop formal titles even

Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.

an act of charity if I’m sure of m’ground,
but . . . ”
“Not charity,” I quipped. He mis-
understood.
“Admit it is charity. You never see
things straight. Gotta go. Spear-fishing.
You've kept me late. 0.K.?”
“0.K.,” I said. Cake, I thought. Perhaps
the ping-pong set? Nothing Christmassy.
Make it casual.
Mr Kowalski did not telephone. Eight
times on the Saturday I dialled his num-
ber, but no one replied. I had asked a
friend of my husband’s, a TPI who
comes to dinner every Sunday, to drive
me to the hospital.
“I can’t stand that sort of place,” he
objected.
“You don’t have to come in, and I’ll
just dash in and out. Please?” I begged.
“You’ll be here to dinner in any case,
won’t you?” I blackmailed, not caring
how blatantly. “It’s only a twenty-minute
drive, but it takes three buses from here.
Bill will be out, and I can’t drag Peter
and Dick on three buses in this heat.”
Reluctantly he agreed to act as chauffeur.
I’d lashed out on a punnet of straw-
berries and a hunk of fruitcake. If
Wanda Kowalski didn’t feel like eating,
her husband could take them home.
/Yn Saturday evening I telephoned the
hospital to enquire if it would be
convenient for Mrs Kowalski to have a
visitor the next afternoon. I was told
“as from this morning she has been
given a special five-days trial leave to
be with her husband.”
During the next two days I intermit-
tently dialled the Kowalski number; as
early as 7 a.m.; as late as 11 p.m. No
success. Then, by a surprising co-
incidence, I walked slap into Zielinski
at Halfmoon Bay. I was delighted, even
if he did still reek of the same carnation
perfume and wear unsuspectedly knobbly
knees. We pumped hands.
“Have you seen the Kowalski family
lately?” I enquired, chattily. His face
dropped. “A-ah, not for long time, but
her husband come to see me last week.
He just burn his paintings, he be sad,
upset. And Mrs Kowalski be seeck. In
mind hospital.” I was pleased that he
knew, as I had not intended asking; and
I registered a silent tribute to Kowalski
for having sense enough to destroy those
frightening portraits.
“Are they away?” I asked. “Their
’phone doesn’t answer. She is on leave
from the hospital, and I’d like to see
her. Do you know any of their friends?”
“No, you get. No friends, too busy.
Kip on try, just out. He has holiday two
veeks, you get.” I invited Zielinski to
visit us any time he felt like it, but he
did not even repeat our address. He
either did not understand or felt that I
was merely being courteous. As he re-


gretfully said he had not yet found a
“vife,” he ogled a skimpily-attired
brunette who wore plaits.
That night, still wondering about
Wanda Kowalski, I felt ashamed. It had
not even occurred to me that we had a
spare bedroom, a sofa, and two beds
not in use.
On the Wednesday, Mr Kowalski an-
swered his telephone.
“You reeng again, Miss Marie?” (Was
he annoyed? Or merely startled at a
snail’s wearing grasshopper-guise?) I
threw his sensitivity to the winds.
“I’m so sorry to hear about your wife,”
I explained. “Why didn’t you tell me? I
have tried and tried to get you since I
spoke to Tony. Were you away?”
“You try? Ah, sometimes is hart to
get. I vork, am not much home. I vork
hart this last veek. Sometimes ’phones are
crossed line. I send boys away for holi-
day. No one here." Oh, well, it wasn’t my
business.
“I would like to visit your wife,” I
said. “I wouldn’t upset her. How is she?”
“Ah! She be out for today. One day of
leafe, first time. I just take back. She is
terrified. Terrified. She veep hard. You
not visseet. It better she take the tablets
and forget. Doctor is friend to me. I vork
here long time. He goot. Understand.
Goot doctor.”
“How long has she been ill?” I asked.
“A-ah, long time. Always so depress.
No one to see she know. She is nuisance.
Eell, always eell. Stom-ach. Spine. Can-
not work at hospital. I do cooking lot.
Cooking hard I know, but I do. Hard
to man, yes?” Politely he laughed.
Self-pitying rat, I thought.
“Please, couldn’t I see her? I wouldn’t
stay, just pop in and out and ...”
His tone became brusque. “No. No,
not to see. / look after. You forget. Not
nice. How is family?”
“Fine. How are the boys?”
“Boys? Goot. Send to guest house at
beach. First time. They like. Cost much
money, but send.”
I felt disappointed that Kowalski
didn’t trust me to be tactful.
“I’ll telephone you within a few days.
Friday? Will you be home on Friday?”
I asked.
“Ah-ah!” (I was beginning to become
annoyed with the silent reflections that
routed all these “Ah”s and “A-ah”s.) “I
hard to get. Very hard.”
“Well, what time? I can ring any
time.”
“A-ah, not reeng. Too hard to get. Not
to worry.” Really!
“Could you ring me, then? I am con-
cerned about your wife.”
“Yess, yess. I haf number, I reeng.
But not to worry. She nearly well. Soon
not be in hospital.”
Oh, well, I thought, I guess the poor
fellow is damn tired, and worried. He
probably doesn’t mean to sound so like
a mule Hyper-sensitive, maybe, even if
e oes look stolid and shiny.
Later on in the evening, when I was
hosing the capsicum seedlings, I suddenly
remembered Piotr Kowalski s red-toned
portraits that stiessed only vacuity or
frenzy. Memory twanged a further ir-
relevant chord, and I wondered what his
former name had been. So, knowing that
I was an interfering, inquisitive idiot, I
rang the hospital and was connected to
the ward that housed Wanda Kowalski.
e sisters voice was bright as glass
seen through syrup.
“T am a friend of Mrs Kowalski's,” I
said. “I have not seen her for a year,
but I am godmother to one of her two
sons and have known the family for
seventeen years. I have just been speak-
ing to her husband, who says it is pre-
ferable that she have no visitors. Last
time I rang you I was told visitors would
be good for her.”
“Are you a relative, dear?” asked the
voice.
“No. Her relatives, bar her husband
and sons, live in Poland. I’m an Aus-
tralian friend.”
ut . . T ,„ , , , , „
Just a minute. 111 check her card.”
The voice returned: “You must be
guided by her husband, dear. He knows
best. We Australians can’t understand the
New Australians when they’re in trouble,
don’t you see? The language problem is
so difficult. If he told you not to visit,
he would know. This is a lovely bright
hospital. Have you seen the trees?”
“Yes, I have driven through,” I said,
“j h ave seen trees. Does her doctor
speak Polish?”
“Nothing to worry about at all. She
is very, very happy.” Sugar!
“i s s he coming out soon?” I asked,
“I couldn’t say, dear. Only doctor
would know that. Tha-ank you,” the
voice ushered out.
Three weeks passed, and I wondered,
and wondered, for Piotr Kowalski did
not telephone me -back. Then, three days
after I did ring again (he spoke hurriedly,
and said his w jf e h a( j “the ear that bleed,
cannot spik,” so I’d said I would ring
“next week”) a small paragraph in a
morning newspaper caught my eye. The
six lines stated that a woman by name of
Wanda Kowalski, from Broadmeadows,
had been found gassed in her kitchen. A
head-in-the-oven job. “Mrs Kowalski,”
said the cold print, “was an ex-mental
hospital patient who was still on drugs.
Her husband, Piotr, was asleep in the
bedroom at the time of the tragedy. Her
two you ,?§ sons were holidaying at
Sor . rer ’ t °’
And * stl " wondered, and will wonder
forever, for it seemed so black and white;
particularly when Piotr Kowalski mar^
ried a twenty-five-years-old Australian
nurse three months later. Assimilation,
maybe, at last?
But then, my twin often remarks that
I “don’t see things straight.”
"And I've invested the loot in 5% stock maturing the very year
you get out."

A Romantic
of Wine
When a cellar isn’t enough. ..
By CELLARMASTER
Among the amateur brotherhood of
wine there are many romantics
—men who spend a considerable
part of their leisure discussing wine,
delving into its lore and tradition, deve-
loping their tastes and opinions about it,
drinking it almost unceasingly, and de-
lighting in it unremittingly.
These men almost all own cellars or,
at least, collections of wine; they are
enthusiastic members of eating and
drinking societies; and if they do not
have the means to visit the classic wine
areas of the world, at least they dream
of doing so. From these men come
many of the gifted judges at the various
shows, and their opinions are often
worthwhile, and are listened to with
respect by the professionals. And these
professionals very often listen, for the
wine romantic is rarely reticent, and
such is his love for wine that he wishes
all to share in it.
Such a person is Max Lake. Max
has a large and generous nature and this
is reflected in his person. He is a sur-
geon by profession, a bon vivant by
inclination, and a serious and knowledge-
able student of wine by application. He
is known by most of the winemakers
and vineyard owners of the country, is
always ready to listen and learn from
them, and is equally ready to impart his
knowledge and give his time to would-
be wine lovers.
T>ut these are the qualities of many a
wine romantic, and do not single him
out especially. But one thing does: Max
Lake has bought himself a vineyard.
Now this is relatively common overseas.
Many of the great vineyards of France
and Germany are owned by people
whose work occupies them elsewhere.
Indeed, this is not only a prerogative of
the wealthy; for in some cases, and
especially in Burgundy, vineyards are
split up almost row by row, and these
parts may have owners in quite humble
circumstances.
But Max went even further than this.
Not only did he want to own a vineyard,
but he was prepared to develop one
from country that had never before
seen the vine. He had various reasons
for this. His two favorite winegrowing
areas are Coonawarra and the Hunter
Valley. Since Coonawarra was 800
miles from his work and the Hunter only
100, it was inevitable that he should
choose Hunter. But none of the vine-
yards operating at the time was for sale,
and none of them was producing the
grapes in which he was particularly in-
terested. So there was nothing for it but
to buy some land and develop it himself.
Now, this was to be no haphazard
job. Max had noticed that most of the
better parts of the vineyards of the Hun-
ter were based on volcanic soil. The
topsoil of this region is patchy and made
up of various markedly different types
of soil, but again and again it was
noticeable that those areas most dear to
the vigneron’s heart were volcanic resi-
duals. So for three years Max charged
all over the Hunter Valley digging holes
in the soil here and there until he found
what he was looking tor. Drainage,
exposure to the sun, watershed, proxi-
mity of services, relative freedom from
the notorious hail storms and many
other factors were considered before
Max finally made his choice—6o acres of
land not far from the Rosehill Paddock,
17 of which would be suitable for the
vine upon which Max based his hopes—
the Cabernet Sauvignon.
in itself is One of the most interes-
ting aspects of the whole business.
Cabernet, famous for its quality and
notorious for the slightness of its yield,
has never been a favorite in the Hunter,
and only lately has there been any
marked interest in and subsequent plant-
ing of it by established wine makers.
Yet Max is __ convinced that he can
achieve a distinctive and distinguished
wine. He is looking for a wine that
has the bouquet and flavor of the
Cabernets from other areas with the
delicacy, softness and roundness for
which the Hunter area is justly famous.
Last year five acres were planted with
Cabernet. Max and his friends planted
deep and there was a very good strike.
Another five acres will be planted in
August, and seven next year. The
foundations of the winery have been
completed, and the skeleton structure is
now rising proudly above the new
vineyard.
One can only admire such an effort
by a man whose profession in itself is
extremely exacting and demanding of
his time. He alone of all the wine lovers
of my acquaintance is prepared to pay
what must be almost the ultimate in
dedication to the grape and its product.
Sufficient to say that I am looking for-
ward to the day when 1 can sincerely
review Lake’s Folly Cabernet in this
column as a WINE TO BUY.


Around Melbourne
EYESTRAIN FOR ART'S SAKE
Film Festival is one of the best
things that happens in Melbourne.
From May 29 until June 15 we are
enjoying a marvellous Fellini, Ozu,
Bergman, Bunuel, Wajda, Bresson,
Franju, Antonioni feast; films from
all over Mexico, Japan, Turkey.
It is one of the best half dozen
film festivals in the w'orld, of which
there are 140. Only 18 are recog-
nised by the Federation of Inter-
national Producers’ Associations,
and the Melbourne Festival is one of
these. Yet, compared with other
festivals it is a sober, dignified
affair. Erwin Rado, the director, will
tell you that two years ago Berlin
Festival’s budget for flying in and
entertaining the Press was £64,000.
That was quite apart from their
budget for importing and providing
nice hotel accommodation for all the
film stars.
Then, of course, there have been the
incidents; eager film companies
anxious to get world publicity at
Cannes or Venice have hired yachts
for the Press. Then at the precise,
delicate moment, in front of the
photographers, a starlet has fallen
overboard and lost her bra. We
don’t do that sort of thing at Mel-
bourne.
The festival now has a fixed, de-
voted audience of 4000, and you
haven't much hope of seeing it unless
you are a member of a film society
—usually about 30s. a year, then
£3 10s. for the festival tickets. The
members look different from any
other theatre audience —casual in
dress, perhaps slightly smarter in
style than University Union cafe
patrons. And they have a magnificent
contempt for commercial movies.
There’s a red series and a blue
series, 150 features and documen-
taries, which is a huge diet by any
festival standards. The thing to do is
to go every other night, and on
Saturdays and Queen's Birthday
there’s a noble opportunity to ruin
your eyesight. There are movies
from 10 a.m. to 12, 2 p.m. to 4.30
p.m., 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and 8
p.m. to 11 p.m. Erwin Rado says
many of the devoted do all this, and
those who believe that the meal and
tea breaks are wasteful can further
fill in the time by looking at docu-
mentaries in another theatre.
This is the 13th and best year of
the festival. It has had battle all the
way. There has been united opposi-
tion from the commercial distributors,
who always have been terrified that
any film shown at the festival would
destroy a future market. So they
have had to cultivate artistic films that
would never be showm here, and now'
the showing of a foreign film that is
likely to hit the local circuit calls for
arrangements of the most delicate
kind. Local theatres, too, have staged
almost a complete lock-out.
Tt all started at Olinda, moved to the
untidy great Exhibition Buildings,
to the Union Theatre at Melbourne
University. Now, rather splendidly,
the festival is at the Palais at St Kilda.
They got the Palais because it is not
tied down by any of the theatre
chains. And this is a theatre. May-
be there are several larger picture
theatres in the country, but not many.
It seats 2964 and hasn’t changed a
tassel since it was built in 1927.
The furniture is what you w'ould
describe as Italian Renaissance-Holly-
w'ood Lush. On either side of the
stage are two urns; enormous they
are, big enough to hold all the ashes
of the human race. The festival com-
mittee, clearly embarrassed by their
imposing phallic dimensions, this year
made cotton suits to cover them in the
festival colors.
There are other problems. The
Customs Department is kind enough
to let in the films duty free; but for
this it w'ould be impossible to carry
on. But under the regulations each
film can be seen by only 2000 people,
so there’s the curious sight of the
1000 seats always empty in the dark
upper reaches of the Palais. What’s
more, the films are censored. Maybe
the censors are more liberal because
they know the films will be viewed
by a sophisticated audience. Yet
Erwin Rado can point out that only
two countries in the world censor
festival films. Spain is one and Aus-
tralia the other. Even Eire, for
heaven's sake, doesn't do it.
The Governor, Sir Rohan Dela-
cornbe, opened the red series, and the
Irish actor, Michael MacLiammoir,
opened the blue. MacLiammoir was
good value. He played lago in the
Orson Welles’ production of “Othel-
lo", and not until he arrived in Mel-
bourne did he ever see the film.
Making it with Welles was agony
enough, but even a year after the
film had been made it was still not
released. It was then that Welles
came to him and said he was un-
satisfied with the second half of one
speech. Would he make it again?
The only trouble was that in the
intervening 12 months he had lost
1 i stone. So for this reason “Othel-
lo" was interesting. The audience
could admire the one actor who had
lost 1 i stone during the course of a
speech.
So, after entertainment by Mr Mac-
Liammoir. we went on to “81” the
introspective semi-fantasy, the crea-
tion of Federico Fellini.
T>ut there's a strange irony in all
this. Back before the First World
War Melbourne was the headquarters
of a splendid film industry. It is
claimed that up at Warrandyte we
made the world's first feature film,
“The Kelly Gang”. Now, with no
Government subsidy, no interest, our
film industry doesn't exist. The festi-
val has feature films from Mexico,
Brazil, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands
and Sweden, but not one from Austra-
lia. On Australia night last Monday,
June 8, the top Australian film was
the ABC's excellent “I, the Aborigi-
nal’’; but alas, only a 55-minute docu-
mentary.
Yes, we have one of the world's best
film festivals, and Mr Rado tours the
world to make sure we get the world’s
best films, but we have precious little
to show anyone else.

FORUM
Inside the Communist Party
How its 4000 members operate
By FRED WELLS
In its 40-odd years of existence the
Communist Party of Australia has
had more publicity than any of the
other major political parties. Yet its
organisation, aims, methods and fronts
are still hardly known by the average
citizen.
The diagram on page 40 gives some
idea of its efficient apparatus. This
organisation constantly changes and a
scrutiny of the Communist Press is
necessary to keep up to date. Only the
National and NSW organisation is
shown, but all States are organised along
similar lines.
The CPA now has a numerical
strength of about 4000, the lowest since
its period of illegality, and is distributed
amongst the States approximately in this
way:
Members Led by
NSW 1860 L. Donald & W. Brown
Victoria 700 R. Gibson & J. Sendy
Sth Aust. 300 J. Moss & A. Finger
West Aust. 200 S. Aarons & R. Gandini
Queensland 900 E. Bacon & C. Jones
Tasmania 70 M. Bound &
W. H. Wilson
N. Territory 30
ACT 20
The party has always been strongest
in NSW and its headquarters have always
been located in Sydney. The relatively
small membership in Victoria can be
accounted for by the ideological split
between pro-Peking Ted Hill and pro-
Moscow Laurie Aarons. In 1928 the
party numbered about 250, increasing to
3000 during the depression years and
reaching a peak membership of 22,500
in 1944. Since then it has decreased
year by year to the present low figures.
The extent to which the CPA is based
on NSW can be gathered from the num-
ber of NSW members on the three main
committees, the Secretariat, Political and
Central Committees. The top committee,
the Secretariat, comprises L. Aarons, E.
Aarons, L. L. Sharkey, R. Dixon, J.
Hughes and W. Brown all of NSW.
The only interstate member is Claude
Jones of Queensland. A point of inte-
rest lies in the fact that all these men
are professional revolutionaries of the
political wing; the last industrial experi-
ence any of them had was when
Brown worked as a newspaper reporter
in 1946-47.
All the Secretariat are members of
the next highest body, the Political
Committee. Other members, according
to the Communist Press, are R. Gibson
of Victoria, E. Bacon of Queensland and
W. Gollan of NSW. Of these only
Gollan, who is a high school principal,
has any contact with the outside world.
The majority of the Political Committee
are also based in NSW.
Again all members of the Political
Committee are on the Party’s Central
Committee which numbers about 42.
The Central Committee at present would
be understrength due to the deaths of
J. Healy and E. Robertson, the expul-
sions of Ted Hill, Flo Russell and Frank
Friday, June 12, to Monday,
June 15, the Communist Party of
Australia will hold its 20 th National
Congress at party headquarters,
168-174 Day Street, Sydney.
Its problems will include the cam-
paign against Ted Hill’s rival pro-
Peking Communist Party; the struggle
for leadership between L. Sharkey and
L. Aarons; and, above all, the problem
of how to sell Moscow’s new “soft”
line to the Australian people.
Johnson and the resignations of P.
Malone and K. Miller.
As well as those already mentioned,
prominent trade union leaders who are
members of the Central Committee in-
clude Messrs Pat Clancy (NSW Sec-
retary, BWIU), E. V. Elliott (Federal
Secretary, Seamen’s Union), J. J. Brown
(Federal Pres, and Victorian Secretary,
ARU), A. McDonald (Secretary, Bris-
bane Trades and Labor Council and
member Interstate Executive, ACTU),
W. Parkinson (General President, Coal
Miners’ Federation), C. Southwell (Vic-
torian Secretary, AEU), T. Wright
(NSW Secretary, Sheet Metal Workers’
Union and member Interstate Executive,
ACTU), E. Ross (Editor, Miners’ jour-
nal “Common Cause”) and H. Hatfield
(Sheet Metal Workers’ Union).
“Tribune” also lists as members J.
McPhillips, J. Bailes, W. E. Campbell,
L. Donald and E. Thornton (all of
NSW); R. Gandini (WA), J. Moss
(SA), J. Sendy (Vic.) and M. Bound
(Tas.).
A scrutiny qf all party publications
shows that only four women occupy any
position of importance, with Mrs Freda
Brown (NSW) and Mrs Alice Hughes
(Q) on the CC, Mrs J. Grant on the
Disputes Committee and Mrs M. Hamp-
son in charge of Culture.
As with the Secretariat and Political
Committees professional revolutionaries
heavily outnumber the industrial wing
and NSW has the majority of members
on the Central Committee. Gollan and
Hatfield are the only workers on the CC.
The party’s liaison man in Moscow is
Alf Watt, an old dependable sent to
dispel the bad impression made by Rex
Chiplin who resigned from the party on
his return to Australia. Watt is osten-
sibly in Moscow as a correspondent for
“Tribune” and rosy despatches from him
regularly appear in the party Press.
The extent to which Laurie Aarons
controls the party is to be seen in the
placing of his allies in charge of all the
important sub-committees under direct
control of the Political Committee. Of
these fourteen sub-committees Aarons
family members head five. Laurie has
the two all-important Cadres and Party
Functionaries and Finance. Eric heads
Propaganda, Publicity and Party Schools
and the NSW Bureau. Mrs M. Hamp-
son (nee Aarons) is in charge of Cul-
ture, although she is at present in Mos-
cow. J. Hughes, trusted ally of the
Aarons, also heads two the Central
Committee Youth Bureau, covering the
Eureka Youth League, the Junior
Eureka League, Youth and Apprentices
and the United Front while Gollan is
in charge of Peace and Friendship and
Education. Then there is also H. Stein
(Migrants and Aborigines), J. Bailes
(Agrarian Committee), Mrs F. Brown
(Women), J. McPhillips (Trade Unions)
and Jim Cooper (New Guinea).
The policies of all these people are
to be found in the “Communist Review”.
J. Hughes, for example, in the “Review”
June, 1963, names the Wolf Cubs, Boy
Scouts and Girl Guides as capitalist
class organisations whose aim is to con-
tain children to the morality of mono-
polists and, with words that Hitler would
have applauded, says, “It is our respon-
sibility to fight the class enemy for the
minds of the working-class children.”
J. Cooper (New Guinea Bureau)
wrote in November, 1961, in the same
publication: “The New Guinea peoples
find themselves at a stage . . . with a
wily, rapacious, ruthless class (i.e., Aus-
tralia) bent on extracting all possible
wealth.”
To administer this party of 4000 there
are, on Ted Hill’s estimate, 200 full-
time functionaries and employees. If
this is correct (and it is probably slightly
exaggerated—another estimate is 120)
it means one full-time functionary to
every 20 members. Even on the lower
figure it is 1 to 34. There is nothing

THE DELFIN AUSTRALIAN FUND INCORPORATED
Directors’ Report for the year ended 30th April, 1964
To our Shareholders,
Your Directors have pleasure in submitting their Annual
Report to shareholders on the activities of the Fund for the
year ended 30th April, 1964.
Financial Statements:
The audited accounts submitted with this Report cover
the activities of the Fund for the year ended 30th April,
1964. Net Assets as at this date amounted to £2,584,457.
Gross Revenue receivable during the period amounted to
£92,172, from which has been deducted a Management and
Investment Advisory Fee of £12,200, leaving a net invest-
ment income available for distribution of £79,972.
An interim dividend at the rate of Id. per share was paid
on 19th December, 1963, and your Directors now recom-
mend a final dividend of Id. per share, making 2d. per
share for the year under review. In the opinion of the
Directors, the disclosed results have not been affected by
items of an abnormal nature.
Proposed Final Dividend:
The recommended final dividend of Id. per share, if
confirmed by shareholders, will be due and payable on
10th June, 1964, to shareholders whose name appeared on
the register at the close of business on sth May, 1964.
Directorate:
Pursuant to Article 65 of the Articles of Association, Mr.
Roger Hamilton Struthers Cavan retires and, being eligible,
offers himself for re-election. In accordance with Article 70,
Messrs. John Wright Blaiklock and Thomas Percy Keene
retire by rotation, and, being eligible, offer themselves for
re-election.
A resolution for the re-appointment of-Mr. Leslie James
Thompson until the next Annual General Meeting of the
Company will be submitted. Mr. Thompson retires in
accordance with Section 121 of the Companies Ordinance
1962.
Auditors:
Messrs. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. retire, and, being
eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Portfolio:
The period under review has brought about a further
growth in the value of the Fund’s portfolio. The net asset
value of the Fund has appreciated from 4/8.9d. per share
at the last annual balance date to 5/5.98d. at the 30th
April, 1964.
During the year, your Investment Advisor—Development
Finance Corporation Limited—has been closely supervising
the portfolio with the object of improving both the capital
value and income of the Fund. Guided by its recommenda-
tions, your Board has added additional companies to the
portfolio while certain others have been eliminated. The
overall effect has been to reduce the number of companies
represented in the portfolio.
The Fund has again benefited from a number of cash
and bonus issues during the period; approximately 18%
of the companies in the portfolio were involved.
Over the last two years, the “per share” earnings of your
fund have been increasing at the average rate of 7i% per
annum. This increase is shown in the following table:
Twelve months ended 30th April, 1962—1.761 pence
Twelve months ended 30th April, 1963—1.847 pence
Twelve months ended 30th April, 1964—2.042 pence
In view of this encouraging feature, the Directors felt
that an increase in the dividend to 2d. per share was fully
justified for the twelve months ended 30th April, 1964.
The Fund’s liquidity position as at 30th April, 1964,
was sound for after allowing for the payment of the final
dividend there was approximately £89,700 available for
investment as suitable buying opportunities occur.
General:
Virtually all sectors of the economy have fully recovered
from the depressed levels of the 1961 recession and current
indications confirm further growth prospects in the present
financial year. Gross National Product for the six months
to 31st December, 1963, showed an increase of 8.9% over
the corresponding period last year. This figure is generally
accepted as the main indicator of national growth.
Other encouraging signs of a more buoyant economy
include:
(1) Employment is currently at a very high level with
only 1.2% of the work force unemployed. With
increasing demand for goods, wage rates can be
expected to rise in the future, generating increased
expenditure within the community;
(2) Production in almost all sectors of industry has
shown a marked increase in the past twelve months.
The production of building materials is showing a
sharp improvement, stimulated by the Government’s
housing subsidy introduced at the last Federal elec-
tions. Output of other goods such as steel, bricks
and cement have also increased.
(3) Capital Investment has risen substantially with
marked increases in building approvals, expenditure
on plant and equipment, and the level of motor
vehicle registrations.
(4) Overseas balance of payments have shown an im-
provement in the six months to December, 1963, of
£124 million over the corresponding period. In the
quarter ending December, 1963, Australia had a
surplus of £42 million on exports compared with a
deficit of £42 million for the corresponding quarter
in 1962.
The general climate for business is exceptionally favour-
able based on the above indicators. Although consumer’s
confidence is still lacking, once they decide to increase
their spending and take advantage of the current buoyant
conditions, then business confidence should also improve.
Please do not hesitate to write if you have any queries
regarding your Fund, but I suggest that its diversified
portfolio represented by a single security, its assured
marketability with complete management being provided
at an annual fee of only ten shillings for each £lOO invest-
ment, represents excellent value to the genuine investor
in Australia’s growth potential.
Yours faithfully,
JOHN H. MARKS,
Chairman of Directors.
LOOKING AHEAD
Money enough to meet our future needs is the dream of all of us. But if financial contentment is to be achieved it calls
for intelligent planning early. A vital part of your planning is to set up an organised financial programme—one that gives vou
a good opportunity to accumulate a fund for future use; one that suits your requirements; one that you can afford.
The Delfin Fund now offers two plans which make it simple for you to invest regularly as you earn. To obtain the
accumulation benefits of continuous investing, you may invest monthly, quarterly or at any interval you wish.
DELFIN CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT PLAN
Features of this Plan are:
• Investment can be made from £lO upwards, either on a monthly,
quarterly or half-yearly basis.
• Members may terminate their contributions whenever they wish
without obligation.
• Shares are allotted to Shareholders in minimum parcels of
100 shares when there are sufficient moneys available in their
account at a reduced service fee of a penny off the normal
charge.
• A Statement of Account is furnished to members each half-year
setting out particulars as to the amount contributed during each
half-year, shares allotted and any cash balance outstanding.
DELFIN DIVIDEND RE-INVESTMENT PLAN
Features of this Plan are:
• Shareholders whose dividends exceed £l2/10/- per dividend
distribution are entitled to join this Plan.
• Shares are allotted to Shareholders in minimum parcels of
100 shares when there are sufficient moneys available in their
account at a reduced service fee of a penny off the normal charge.
• A Statement of Account is sent to members of the Plan after
each dividend distribution setting out details of any shares
allotted, contributions made during the half-year and cash balance
carried forward.
The advantage of investment under either of the above plans is that you are buying at varying market prices at all times,
which will enable you to average out your investment as stock market prices rise and fall.
Members of the Continuous Plan can re-invest their dividends as part of their regular contribution irrespective of amount.

No matter how these functionaries
start out they inevitably conform to a
common mould—unthinking (in all but
Marxist dogma), unseeing (except for
that which will lend an iota of justifica-
tion to the dogma), and looking one-
eyed for the next promotion.
It is the fashion to depict functiona-
ries as dedicated men, sacrificing all for
humanity and existing on a pittance.
Two men have had this to say concerning
functionaries. To Ted Hill, ex-CPA
leader: “A party functionary has con-
siderable authority over others, he has
security, he has power, his economic
problems are looked after. They are
largely divorced from the common folk,
some have never in their lives moved
amongst people at large. L. Aarons is
a classic example of this. ’ S. W. Scott,
former General Secretary of the New
ea an CP, says. . The functionary,
the full-time cadre, is in a dangerous
position. Communism becomes more
and more identified with his power and
position or with that of the leading
party organ in which he works. His
early enthusiasm tends to disappear.
Desire for personal power is likely to
grow and his party duties tend to become
a job and a not unattractive one.
The CPA publishes three weekly news-
papers. “Tribune”, a national news-
P a P er published in Sydney, is edited by
A. Robertson of the Central Committee
and a former Peace Committee organiser.
With a sale of approximately 16,000
copies per week it is subsidised by the
party to the tune of about £4OOO p.a.
The Victorian weekly “Guardian”, edited
by Rex Mortimer, had a circulation
before the split of about 6000 copies.
Because this figure has been considerably
reduced the subsidy has had to be in-

school at Minto, NSW, covers 13 acres.
Another school is located at Anna Bay,
NSW, and further property is owned in
Victoria, Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia.
Just how much it costs to finance this
complex apparatus has never been re-
vealed. Nor have the sources of such
finance been satisfactorily explained. A
recent figure quoted was £250,000 per
year. On surface appearances this could
not be far off the mark.
Of all its sub-committees none is more
important to the CP than the Trade
Union Committee. Take away the sup-
port of the unions and the CP would
decline into a debating society. The
greatest fear of the CP is that the ALP
might run its own Labor Party tickets
in union elections and so ruin the value
of “unity tickets”. CP leaders have
always recognised the fact that in a
contest for union office between a Com-
munist and a Labor man, other things
being equal, the Labor man will win.
To retain a position where ALP men
will stand on the same tickets with and
support Communists is of major im-
portance.
But the CP, through unity tickets, the
lack of capable ALP opposition and
sheer lethargy on the ALP’s part is
winning back union after union. One
of the most important unions in Aus-
tralia last year came under CP sway
v.'hen long-time CP member S. Lewis
was elected President of the NSW
Teachers’ Federation and there was
not a ripple on the surface of public
apathy.
Though Communists work hard and
successfully to deny other political
parties the right to organise in the
unions; using the catchery of “No
politics in the union”, they plan strategy
and tactics down to the last detail
through their fractions which meet
any union meeting or election.
Tt is next to impossible for a rank-and-
file member to get a word in at a
National Congress and the only rank-
and-file member who attends does so as
a piece of window dressing. Laurie
Aarons has said that there will be 170
delegates at Congress this year and that
in theory these delegates are elected
through a series of meetings from branch
level up to State Committees. In the pro-
cess branches elect delegates to Section
Conferences from which delegates are
elected to the conferences of the District
Committees and thence to the State
Conference. As members at each level
automatically attend the next highest
conference, it is easily seen that by the
time the National Congress comes
around only the elite attend. Central
Committee members automatically attend
Congress as full delegates. This nar-
rows the field to 130 elected dele-
gates and they (bureaucrats and career-
ists also) have a vested interest in main-
taining the status quo.
I have seen one Political Committee

ignored and not one person batted an

The idea that the membership frame
policy is a plain fallacy. Congress is
the ruling body and its decisions are
binding, but it meets only once in three
years. Between Congresses, decisions of
the CC are binding, and it meets four
times a year. Between these meetings
decisions of the Political Committee are
binding, and it meets every six weeks;
and during those six weeks decisions of
the Secretariat are binding—and the
Aarons dominate the Secretariat and are

The Catholic Schools’ Crisis
“Confused interests , conflicting authorities , muddled thinking”
By HELEN LEIGH
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Sydney, Cardinal Gilroy, has called
on the parishioners, in the Arch-
diocese of Sydney, to subscribe an initial
£3 million in order to finance sweeping
changes in the Catholic school system
there. The Cardinal says in his Pastoral
Letter that extraordinary measures are
necessary to meet the crisis of survival
for Roman Catholic schools.
There is no denying that Catholic
schools are in crisis. While the bishops
have been reluctant to mention the word
“crisis”, the Catholic Press refers to it
frequently enough. However, it has
invariably been in the context of trying
to increase the intake of subjects into
the teaching orders, of appealing for
greater financial support, or of explain-
ing some modification in the Catholic
school structure. It has never been sug-
gested that the authorities should
evaluate the structure as a whole. This
should now be done.
To the bystander who views the
massive material edifice of Catholic edu-
cation—the schools, colleges and teach-
ing hospitals—it would appear that the
whole system is governed by a well-
ordered plan. Yet, as is evidenced by
the “reorganisation” of many schools
(ostensibly to cope with the Wyndham
Report), it would appear that the Catho-
lic Education Office is merely a shaky
crust on a pie made of confused inter-
ests, conflicting authorities and muddled
thinking.
In Australia the majority of primary
schools are parochial schools, and sub-
secondary schools are conducted inde-
pendently by the religious orders that
staff them. Often there is fierce compe-
tition between the parish schools and
private colleges. Any changes in the
parochial school system must come from
the bishops, and yet, so far, they seem
to be the least worried at the crisis of
these schools. One has only to have two
ears to be aware that the problems of
these schools are a constant source of
worried and critical comment on the part
of Catholic parents. These parents, “the
people in the pews”—“the laity”—are
far from happy about the way in which
the schools are conducted. They are
expected to support their local clergy
and parish; they are bound by Church
law to send their children to a Catholic
school, and at the same time contribute
to the establishment of these institu-
tions and their maintenance. It is not
uncommon for some families to be sup-
porting as many as three or four differ-
ent schools!
There also seems to be a large amount
of discussion among the clergy, which
is not surprising since the majority of
them have the parochial school, its
erection, upkeep and staffing, as their
biggest parochial problem. Yet there
is such a complete lack of dialogue be-
tween the bishops, clergy and laity, that
the bishops seem to be able to remain
unconscious of the reality of the crisis.
So absolute is this lack of dialogue that
one bishop declined to accept a petition
presented to him by a group of parents
that he establish an enquiry into the
ject to the bishop. Quite a lot of the Catholic schools of his diocese. So

absolute is this dialogue that a national
conference of the League of Catholic
Women was told, by a representative of
the hierarchy, not to be passing resolu-
tions about education. This lack of dia-
logue is the more difficult to understand
since the core of Catholic educational
philosophy is that parents have the first
right and duty with regard to the edu-
cation of their children. And if the laity
are powerless to persuade the bishops to
show some realism in really facing the
crisis in education, the clergy are even
more so, being so absolutely subject
to their bishops.
The Australian Catholic Press might
be expected to give an accurate picture
of the Catholic schools, and to make
positive proposals for remedying their
defects. The Catholic Press, however,
reflects the attitude of the hierarchy
an attitude to which might be applied
the opprobrious word “triumphalism”
which gained currency at the Ecumenical
Council. It will publish nothing that
implies that the system needs a thorough
examination. There was evidence of this
attitude early last year. An article
had appeared in “The 20th Century”
of June, 1962, entitled “Catholic Schools
and Catholic Education, 1962”—written
by Rev. J. Kelly. It was clearly a
challenge to the hierarchy, especially in
NSW, to adopt a realistic approach to
the changing situation in education, and
was widely acclaimed as highly signifi-
cant. It was reprinted in “Adult Edu-
cation”, the journal of the Adult Educa-
tion Council of Victoria. At the March,
1962, meeting of the Catholic Press
Association of Australasia, it was given
the “Father Murtagh Award” as the
best article by an Australian to have
appeared in a Catholic paper or peri-
odical during the previous year. Yet
even when requested by different people,
who had missed seeing the article in
“The 20th Century”, with its limited cir-
culation, “The Catholic Weekly” would
not reprint it, to make it widely avail-
able in NSW.
Church has made few positive
efforts to take a leading part in the
sphere of tertiary education. It is true
that in the early 1950 s St Patrick's Col-
lege, Manly, was set up as a degree-
giving centre for Catholic theology; its
enrolment, however, was very strictly
limited to those who were preparing
themselves for the clerical life. After a
lapse of another ten years, the diocese
of Sydney established at North Sydney a
teacher training scheme for girls
leaving Catholic schools; and in the in-
terim a few half-hearted efforts were
made on the level of adult education.
Although conditions in the USA and
Australia are far from being identical,
there is sufficient similarity for events
in the former to have implications for
the latter. The Catholic Church in both
countries has put tremendous efforts into
providing parochial schools for Catholic
children. In America, too, important
changes are taking place. The most
significant was reported in “Time” of
March 20, after making headlines
across the US: Archbishop Alter of Cin-
cinnati has given notice that the paro-
chial schools of his archdiocese will close
their first grades in September. He has
given generous notice to public school
authorities to prepare to enrol an addi-
tional 10,000 children. While Dr Alter
has made this move to protect the status
quo in higher grades, it is not just an
instance of grades in a school, or a
school, or even a group of schools being
closed (“Time” gives a number of in-
stances of this) but is a formal move by
an archbishop to adjust the parochial
school system of a whole archdiocese
to a new situation. Dr Alter has for-
mally recognised the impossibility of
providing parochial schools for all
Catholic children right through primary
school.
There has been a lot of thinking and
writing in America, and some experi-
menting, in view of the crisis in which
Catholic schools find themselves. Per-
haps we could expect much more exa-
mination and experimentation there, be-
cause the Education Department of the
National Catholic Welfare Conference
provides machinery for this for which
there is no parallel in Australia.
There has been an attempt in the
Archdiocese of St Louis, Missouri, to
weld all the schools of the archdiocese
into a real system, as distinct from a
collection of independent schools, with
a view to greater efficiency and eco-
nomy. Recent discussion in “The Catho-
lic Digest” on whether or not the Con-
fraternity of Christian doctrine, which
is a highly organised attempt to provide
religious instruction and training for
Catholic children who attend public
schools, could cope if all Catholic ele-
mentary graders attended public primary
schools, provides evidence that some
people take seriously the possible closure
of most Catholic elementary schools.
The “Catholic Digest” of February,
1964, outlines an attempt being made
in Pittsburgh, Pa., at a “shared time”
arrangement, with Catholic children at-
tending public schools for part of the
day. Dr Theodore Powell, of the Con-
necticut State Department of Education,
is quoted as asking, in comment on this
arrangement, whether the Catholic-
school educator “has paid too much
attention to the Catholic schools, and
not enough to Catholic children”. This
is obviously a suggestion, in the politest
possible terms, that the Catholic authori-
ties might re-examine their whole posi-
tion, for it is very obvious that all the
changes and adaptations so far have
been made outside any genuine evalua-
tion of the parochial school system.
An evaluation has been attempted by
a Catholic mother of five boys. Mrs
Mary Perkins Ryan has written a book,
“Are Parochial Schools the Answer?”
She clearly comes up with a negative
answer, though her title and her argu-
ment are mainly in the form of ques-
tions. Not unnaturally, some Catholic
education officials have not welcomed
what one refers to as “a foolish book”

What importance do you place on your business records? It's
easy to say “Nothing will happen to them,” but it is not always
the other fellow that is devastated by fire ... it could be you!
Only specially built fire-resistant equipment, such as the range
built in Australia by Chubb, can make your records —your
business memory—completely safe from fire. The fact that a
building is fireproof does not alter the fact that the contents of
the building remain inflammable. Today, with the introduction
of the many synthetic materials into office furnijture, a fire in a
modern building can create an even more intense heat than
previously experienced. And how do you for an insurance
claim, the list of your outstanding accounts or a secret file that
may have taken years to compile. Make a point to contact Chubb
and to examine the comprehensive range of fire-resistant record-
protection cabinets. It pays to be careful when your business
is at stake.

but others have praised it. Another
evaluation is being made by the Jesuit
Loyola University in Chicago, and the
preliminary findings do not indicate the
sharp difference between Catholic pro-
ducts of Catholic and public schools that
could fairly be expected from the em-
phasis placed by the Church authorities
on Catholic schools.
Some modifications have been adopted
by Australian Catholic school authorities
more or less freely, while others have
been forced on them. In some of the
larger cities there have been efforts to
eliminate some secondary schools in
favor of larger, strategically placed high
schools, each serving a group of parishes.
Many more lay teachers are being
employed, and in places real efforts are
being made to ensure that they are
adequately trained and paid. The ex-
tensive employment in the schools of
the laity themselves “people in the
pews”—has brought home, in more than
a financial regard, the manifold in-
justices and the mixed-up thinking of
the clergy and religious superiors, in a
great number of cases.
Looking down on teachers
Who are these “lay teachers”? At a
"" recent meeting of Catholic teachers
one of the speakers referred to them as a
miscellany: former members of the State
Department of Education, sometime
religious or candidates for the clerical
state, and a sprinkling of those who are
employed in Catholic schools because
they cannot get a job anywhere else!
Is it any wonder, then, that in the past,
many of the religious looked down
upon (and some continue to do so) the
lay teacher as a person who was a little
less than the least? But in the present
economy, the religious have found that
they cannot do without the help of a
secular staff; in some schools there are
more secular teachers than there are
religious. As the system continues to
grow, it would appear that in the very
near future, in Catholic schools,
religious will be in the minority.
Over a period of years, the secular
teachers have been unhappy with their
status of “second class citizens” and
although isolated efforts have been
made to eradicate the insecurity and
(too often) injustice which has pre-
vailed, no success was achieved until
1963. The movement for a concerted
effort towards “better things” came, not
from the top, from those in authority,
but from the ranks, from the teachers
themselves. Perhaps this may prove a
grave error on the part of the ecclesi-
astical authorities, for the association of
teachers (the Catholic Institute of
Teachers) that was eventually formed,
found itself independent of Church
direction.
There have been many among the


religious, men and women of vision
and charity, who have been outspoken
in their demands for a fair deal in
regard to secular teachers. But in the
overall drive for material and examina-
tion successes, the orders and congrega-
tions have disregarded these demands
from within their own ranks, and have
contributed not a little to the confusion
and discontent that is so evident in
Catholic schools.
In Queensland, changes in the State’s
educational arrangements have neces-
sitated the provision of more Catholic
secondary schools, and an attempt is
being made to provide them. In NSW
the new secondary system has effectively
reduced Catholic schools in all but the
larger centres to the status of primary
schools. Some smaller schools tried to
carry on but they are surrendering one
by one, that at Moruya being the most
recent. The interesting thing is that the
official attitude in country areas is to
pretend that nothing has really changed,
and no thought has been given by the
bishops, apparently, to the problem of
providing adequate religious instruction
for the many Catholic children who are
being forced into public high schools,
nor are they prepared to examine
whether the country primary school is
still desirable in each parish. It is note-
worthy that the changes in America all
followed the line of clinging to the
Catholic High schools, even if the
elementary school or some of its grades
had to go, and the American element-
ary school with its eight grades takes
children to a greater maturity than does
the six grade primary school here,
The future of Catholic schools in this
country is not a matter that concerns
only the Catholic bishops or Catholic
parents but the Catholic lay teachers as
well but neither parents nor lay
teachers were consulted about the
Cardinal’s Pastoral.
100,000 Unsatisfied
Customers
The PMG—two billion 'phone calls a year
By J. C. HORSFALL
\ ustralia’s biggest business enterprise,
the Post Office, which employs up-
wards of 88,000 people and whose
written-down fixed assets are roughly
£550 million is apparently also the most
frustrated. A top Post Office spokesman
told me last week that this had little
to do with the £1.7 million deficit (which
was inclusive of a loss of £3 to £4 mil-
lion telephone services) which the PMG,
Mr A. S. Hulme, recently told the
Liberal Party State Convention in Bris-
bane his Department would incur this
financial year. (Actually this deficit
would represent a profit of something
like £l2 million under the pre-1962-63
accounting methods which did not charge
interest on fixed capital against revenue.)
The trouble is that despite capital spend-
ing of £74.4 million this year (£68.4
million last year) on the expansion of the
telephone network, the Post Office is
falling even further behind in coping
with applications for new telephones.
At the end of April this year there
were just over 100,000 unsatisfied appli-
cations for telephones. This was about
25 per cent more than in April, 1963.
Of these 100,000 or so, nearly 50,000
are in the process of being connected to
the system. But there were 51,448
applications which cannot be satisfied
until buildings, equipment and cable re-
ticulation are ready. Some of these
applications will not be satisfied by this
time next year.
Achieving this year's target of adding
105,000 new services to the telephone
will mean connecting 181,000 new ser-
vices and withdrawing 75,000 cancelled
services, in addition to handling 100,000
cases where there is a change of sub-
scriber, and about 1000 calls per work-
ing day for alterations or additions to
existing services.
The Department has this programme
up to schedule, but in the interim the
accumulation of new applications, which
are building up at a faster rate than new
motor car registrations, will make the
backlog worse than ever. In the last
two years there has been a dramatic
increase in the demand for new tele-
phones. Until recently the annual in-
crease was about 6 per cent a year. Cur-
rently applications are rising by about
20 per cent a year and the Department
estimates the realistic growth rate at
around 10 per cent a year. About 40
per cent of this demand is from business.
The rest reflects not only population
growth but “the changing social pattern
wherein Australians now Tank the tele-
phone and the automobile as essential
to their way of life as the rest of modern
appliances”.
In the last ten years 810,817 new ser-
vices have been installed bringing the
total up to 1,812,181, and the number
of telephones per head up from 15.6 to
23.11, giving Australia the fifth highest
telephone density in the world. In the
process the percentage of manual ser-
vices has been reduced from 35 to 20
per cent, 16,083 new trunk lines and
8972 new public telephones (a 50 per
cent increase) have been added and 242
new standard automatic and 985 country
automatic exchanges have been installed.
This has entailed putting in 6| million
wire miles of cables. From the 2,522,000
telephones in service Australians now
make something like two billion calls a
year, or nearly double the number ten
years ago.
escalator situation calls for a
basic reassessment of how much the
nation should be spending on its tele-
communications services. The Depart-
ment tells me that at present it costs an
average of about £570 to install one
single new telephone service. The cost
of keeping up to date with technical
advances in telecommunications is enor-
mous, but it must be incurred if only
to keep Australian business communica-
tions up to world standards.
With so many calls on resources for
the expansion of basic services in the
public sector, the question is whether
the Post Office (whose responsibilities of
course range far beyond the telephone
service) is getting its fair share. Out of
a total expenditure of £6BB million in
fixed capital equipment by public enter-
prises and authorities last year it got
8.9 per cent compared with 23 per cent
going to roads, 20 to power, fuel and
light and 10 per cent to water supply
and sewerage, making it fourth in the
long list of claimants. But the Post
Office has been increasing its fixed in-
vestment at a higher rate than the aver-
age of 7.1 per cent increase for the
public sector in the last four years.
Moreover in the last few years the
Post Office has also increased its share
faster than any of the others. Four
years ago it counted for only 7 per cent
(£36 million) of the total. Against this
for the first nine months this year, when
its capital spending rose by just on 9 per
cent, its share was only 8 per cent. In
that period fixed investment in the pub-
lic sector as a whole rose by 10i per
cent; so on a short-term view the Post
Office has lost a bit of ground. Expen-
diture on housing, harbors, water sup-
ply and sewerage and railways has in-
creased at a much higher rate so far this
year.


TWO TICKETS TO NEW ZEALAND-ONE FOR HALF THE NORMAL FARE!
It’s the Qantas “Wife Vacation” Plan. Works two ways.
Your wife gets the holiday she’s been longing for. You get
the savings (and the holiday, too). And, if you’re travelling
to New Zealand on business, what could be better? Still
only one full adult return fare while your wife vacations
along with you for half the return air fare. It’s the kind of
surprise she’ll hug you for —say “No wonder you’ve got
tickets on Qantas!” Take other members of the family, too!
Again, just the one full return adult fare —your wife and
everyone under 26 years of age travels for half or less (under
12 only 35% of the adult fare; under 2 only 10% of the
normal adult return fare). You can fly from Melbourne or
Sydney on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays for holidays
up to 17 wonderful days. And
with Qantas Credit Travel you
can plan your whole holiday
for a mere 10% deposit. Come

SPORT
So That’s Judo?
Not much of a spectator sport
By DISCUS
Qydney Stadium had about 300
people in it a couple of weeks ago
to see 60 rounds of boxing. About
12,000 made its walls bulge the night
Peter, Paul and Mary sang there. The
following night it was back to short
rations, with 2000 or so to see the Aus-
tralian judo championships and Olympic
selections. The number included some
Japanese, some loud Victorian enthu-
siasts, and a fair number of parents who
had been brought along at £1 a head
to swell the funds and see what all the
enthusiasm was about.
It did not seem to be about anything
very much. I went along out of curio-
sity, to see whether the increasing popu-
larity of judo meant that it might have
some future as a spectator sport. Per-
haps it has, on some distant day when
its intricacies are thoroughly appreciated
by a very large number of people, and
practised by a sizable proportion of
them.
The trouble with judo seems to be
that it has so much that cannot be used
in contests because it is too lethal, or
because it requires so much technique,
that what is left is very dull to watch.
The same applies to amateur wrestling,
although I think even that is a more
interesting spectacle.
Our champions stepped on to the
tatami, bowed, approached and grasped
one another by the laundry, and spent
the next five minutes or so testing one
another’s balance, kicking at one
another’s legs, and trying for hip throws.
When one did succeed, the mat work
was no more exciting, consisting of one
man’s struggle to stay on top of another.
At this level it was a poor show. The
audience of enthusiasts thought it was
great, naturally, because they were with
it, but to succeed as a sport it would
have to be capable of exciting those who
were not entirely with it. Most sports
crowds consist of people who are con-
tinually asking, or wondering, “What
happened then?” They go again because
the sport has at least occasional visible
moments of glory.
The best that judo could be was
demonstrated later in the evening by
Yoshinari Takeuchi, a spare six foot,
15 stone Japanese who beat five local
men in as many minutes. Although his
bouts began with the same tugging of
the loose, white clothing judo fighters
wear, his leg work between the moment
of catching his man off balance and
crashing him to the matting was a
marvel to see. But on the mat the rules
seemed to limit him.
Takeuchi is one of Japan’s best, here
to teach our judo fighters some of the
finer points. In this the judo movement
or perhaps cult would be a more
accurate word is doing a distinct ser-
vice to its 20,000 Australian exponents.
If the amateur wrestlers want to make
up some ground they should ask for a
similar loan from Turkey.
The night’s judo entertainment also
included a supposed “self defence”
demonstration in which two girls were
half-heartedly pestered by four youths
and threw them with careless ease. This
performance did not convince me that
judo would be of use against a deter-
mined man with a knife, or a slight
knowledge of wrestling, and the intelli-
gence to make a surprise attack from
behind. It made me wonder whether
judo is not being oversold to the young,
as a body builder, or a means of
defence.

It was laughable to see so many of
our Olympic candidates on television last
week, letting the entertainers help them
to get to the Olympic Games. The oc-
casion was a Telethon in Sydney to raise
£20,000, the amount NSW was lagging
behind on its quota.
It would have been much more to
the point to have seen the various
amateur sporting bodies earning their
share of the necessary during the past
year, and giving the public something
for its money. To my mind it is sickening
to see the sporting associations coast
along year after year, holding their ter-
ribly intense, terribly dull meets, and then
every fourth year crying “Help us!” to
the public.
There are many ways of raising
money, and begging is the poorest of
them. But anything else would not
appeal to most of the sports’ officials,
who are too busy “controlling”, or fight-
ing among themselves for a little power,
or organising the same old events in the
same old ways, to be willing to engage
in honest efforts to put their sports on
a sound financial basis.
I am not willing to be proud of an
Australian Olympic squad, 200 strong,
mostly without a ghost of a chance of
winning so much as a wooden spoon in
Tokyo, which is making the trip as a
large unworthy charity. No member of
the squad is a cripple. Which one of
the 200 can say, truly, “I am still an
amateur”?
The Olympian answer is still a red
herring. Our young contenders work so
hard for the honor, spend countless
hours training, do without so many
things. Tut, tut. Isn’t that supposed to
be the Olympic ideal? And isn’t it
strange that each year some 20,000 other
young Australians go abroad on the £5OO
they have saved by working at two jobs,
doing without, etc.?
This should be the last time the public
is asked to subscribe to send away an
Olympic squad. Each sport should pay
its own competitors’ way to the Games.
We should never again send away 200
beggars.

There will be some groans this week
about Australia’s Rugby League team for
the First Test against France. The basis
-—the fact that in a Queensland-NSW
match the Queensland side actually
showed signs of trying to play something
remotely like good football. The relief,
after two shoddy matches between Syd-
ney-Country and Sydney-France, was
enough to warp anyone’s judgment. But
in the Queensland side, only Day was
good enough to make the present Aus-
tralian team, with Arch Brown the
outstanding reserve prospect.
France’s tour has been a flop so far.
But when the Frenchmen field their Test
< team next Saturday— not the team of
lightweight forwards and elderly backs,
but their real Test team —they might
force our men to get some of the lead
out and play champagne football.

MUSIC
Patrick White’s Opera
The advent of Peter Sculthorpe
By JOHN SMALL
T)erhaps the most exciting news of
recent months has been that Patrick
White is working on the libretto of
a new opera, based on the story of Mrs
Frazer, who was shipwrecked off the
Queensland coast in the last century,
lived with an Aboriginal tribe, and was
taken back to civilisation by an escaped
convict. The production is to be design-
ed by Sidney Nolan, whose series of
Frazer paintings suggested the subject to
White. Rumor has it that the “Trust”
has commissioned the work for the
opening of the Sydney Opera House.
Composer of the opera is Peter Scul-
thorpe, together with Richard Meale,
perhaps the best-known of the younger
Australian composers. He first attracted
attention with a series of works which
have associations with Aboriginal legend,
and his best-known work, “The Fifth
Continent”, has words from D. H. Law-
rence's “Kangaroo”. He will shortly be
setting a sequence of poems by Charles
Higham for solo voice and instruments
and six “urban poems” by Patrick White.
With Sculthorpe, the attention to Aus-
tralian themes is more significant in
terms of the composer’s development
than in the wider context of composition
in Australia. Sculthorpe’s Jindyworobak
phase was primarily a way out of an
impasse to which his previous develop-
ment had led him. Like many other
students of composition after the Second
World War, Sculthorpe turned to serial
technique. Following serialism through
to its logical conclusion he reached a
point at. which all the elements of his
music—pitch, volume, timbre and
rhythm were organised in accordance
with rigidly predetermined patterns.
“After I’d adopted total serialisation”,
he says, “there was nothing left for me
to do. The next step was silence”. After
graduating from Melbourne Conserva-
torium in 1951 he returned home to
Launceston and began to work out a
fresh approach to problems of compo-
sition.
It was at this point that Sculthorpe
turned to specifically Australian themes.
He recalls that he was “aggressively Aus-
tralian” then, but adds that he did not
set out to be a musical nationalist. His
problem was a purely personal one —the
need to find some source from which to
draw sustenance while he set about deve-
loping his own way of writing music.
The new style which he evolved met
with some success. A piano sonatina
was accepted for performance at the
1955 ISCM Festival and a string trio
from the same period has been broadcast
by the BBC. In 1958 he was awarded
a scholarship to Oxford. Several of
his works have now been performed in
England, and have been praised by a
number of leading critics, including Wil-
frid Mellers, with whom Sculthorpe was
associated in a composers’ workshop in
1960. Sculthorpe now teaches at Sydney
University.
he is no longer “aggressively
Australian”, Sculthorpe’s local ties
are still strong. He remarks, “I don’t feel
the need now to keep asserting my
nationality. But I think that in some ways
my music can’t help being Australian”.
The details of the plot of the opera
with Patrick White have not yet been
settled. But Sculthorpe is already antici-
pating problems in writing the music.
“The main difficulty is in trying both to
use contemporary musical techniques and
to write music that people will respond
to. This arises with other music too,
but the problem is more pressing with
opera, which has to be effective as drama,
not just as music.”
In some ways it should be easy for
Sculthorpe to come to grips with this
problem. The character of his mature
works is unaffectedly emotive. He states
that his aim is simply “to communicate
with people” and, significantly, he names
two non-musicians, Drysdale and Law-
rence, as important formative influences
on him. So that in his “Irkanda IV”,
for strings, solo violin and percussion,
the musical structure is determined by
the work’s expressive purpose, which is
itself quite single-minded—the expression
of grief and loneliness. Hence the music
does not develop dialectically, but rather,
as Mellers observed about another of
Sculthorpe’s works, through a process
of “growth by accretion”. A movement
by Sculthorpe usually examines a single
idea (musical or emotional) from a series
of different points of view, instead of
progressing through a series of ideas.
Apart from the opera, Sculthorpe is
at present writing a string quartet for
Musica Viva.

of Architects. Farmers’ Blaxland
Gallery.
HThe bush, nearest subject to most
"*■ Australians, will always be popular
in their appraisal of art. Fred Williams
demonstrates an important fact, namely
that there is always a new way of pre-
senting an old theme, however tiredly
the old cliches may appear to have
affected our vision. He has a few new
facts liberally infused with a slightly
Eastern sensibility indicated by such
titles as “You Yangs” I, II and so on.
He has firmly rejected convention but
can be as nostalgic as the next painter
in his visual reminiscence.
One says “reminiscence” simply as a
pointer to a technique which tries to
grasp a wide experience in a limited
format.
Temper, sympathetic to the subtle
grisaille of color which Williams builds
from, is followed by staccato blots, dots
and little mounds of oil paint, signifying
trunks of trees, foliage clumps, burnt out
stumps, in turn marking out the space.
Since space is important to him he has
abstracted the verticals of trees into
thin black lines. These give structure
but somehow remain aloof from the rest
of the picture.
Fortunately this dichotomy is resisted
in this present showing of paintings and
drawings, these paintings in particular
being the most complete.
On the other hand where a rounded
hillside or sharp horizon demands sky
from earth one expects them to follow
the more naturalistic softness of the
tree forms which resists and undermines
geometric flatness. A resolution is
awaited, but it is fulfilled in a recent
“Red Landscape” where the horizon
does not exist.
A note of turbulence and agitation
has crept into one or two later paint-
ings where the swing is from the in-
terpretive to the frankly expressionist.
Whether Mr Williams’ forthcoming tour
overseas will materially affect his
approach to our landscape will be in-
teresting to watch.

FILMS
On the Town
Sunday in New York. Director, Peter
Tewkesbury. St. James Theatre.
Sydney.
Of Love and Desire. Director, Richard
Rush. Embassy Theatre. Sydney.
HPhe elusive, indefinable quality of
charm, so markedly absent in recent
American romantic comedies, makes a
welcome reappearance in “Sunday in
New York”, a slight but extremely en-
gaging diversion, thanks to the neat script
and direction, and in particular to the
central performances of Jane Fonda and
Rod Taylor.
The plot, such as it is, deals with a
girl’s visit to her gay bachelor brother,
her meeting with an attractive stranger
and (after the standard misunderstand-
ings and complications) a final happy
ending. Routine stuff, but freshly and
lightly handled.
Rod Taylor in particular gives a most
attractive performance, and Jane Fonda
(who has been inflicted with so many
poor films) shows just what she can do
when given even half a chance. She and
Taylor play their roles not only with
wit but with an appealing, understated
warmth of feeling.
Peter Tewkesbury, a recruit from tele-
vision, directs the film straightforwardly
but with assurance, without the agora-
phobia that so often afflicts television
directors confronted with a big screen.
The New York backgrounds, pleasing-
ly photographed, have an air of authen-
ticity, and the script, adapted by Nor-
man Krasna from his own stage play,
transfers smoothly to the screen, with
the incorporated exterior scenes fitting
neatly into the whole.
“Of Love and Desire” is one of those
almost supernaturally bad films which
can be uncommonly diverting to a
student of the movies at their worst. I
unhesitatingly name this as a classic of
its kind.
The ageing Merle Oberon appears as
a rich, genteel nymphomaniac. She un-
expectedly finds true love with a scruffy
engineer who has come to Mexico to
work lor her brother, a mining magnate.
The brother does his best to break up
the romance, and by flinging his sister
into the arms of one of her former
playmates, brings the old Eve to the
surface again.
There follows a singularly amateurish
suicide attempt, after which the brother
confesses himself to have been motivated
by incestuous desire. At this the lady
takes to her spike heels and runs madly
through Mexico City until she collapses
with exhaustion. Not quite the therapy
advised in psychiatric textbooks, but
effective, for she finds herself cured of
nymphomania but mercifully retaining a
taste for the embraces of the seedy en-
gineer.
This bosh is filmed in amazingly
hideous color, is acted quite as badly as
it deserves, and uses every conceivable
cliche of dialogue even, I’m happy to
report, “I never want to see you again!”,
without which of course it couldn't be
a vintage bad film.

The Unsinkable Bette Davis, Channel
9. Sydney.
A Sound of Trumpets. Channel 2.
Sydney.
Tn Bette Davis’ house there is a huge
prettified portrait of her hanging
over the fireplace, and as the camera
lingered on it briefly while Joseph Cot-
ten’s commentary droned on, it seemed
the most honestly revealing moment in
“The Unsinkable Bette Davis”, the
second in Channel 9’s “Hollywood and
the Stars” series. For the self-styled
Queen of Hollywood emerged as both
insecure and egotistical, all the time try-
ing to compensate for both, and all the
time overreaching. Her story is of
great artistic and commercial success
and the most lurid sort of private failure.
Starting her career on the stage, she
went the way of most young actresses
during the adolescence of sound movies.
Her studios tried to force her into
moulds which she did not fit, and cast
her in one potboiler after another.
Despite personal successes in “The Man
Who Played God”, “Of Human Bond-
age”, and “Dangerous”, for which she
won her first Oscar (her own nickname
for the Academy Award), it was not
until her public demonstration of dis-
satisfaction, in attempting to break her
Warner Brothers’ contract, that she was
given decent roles. She won a second
Oscar for “Jezebel” and went on to cre-
ate the Davis myth in a series of fine
films, bringing the many faces of women,
through the not so many faces of Bette
Davis, to the Hollywood screen. She
is the greatest ham in the business,
always the grand lady and always a bit
of a charlatan, but she has style and
verve that make her, for all her heroics
and histrionics, the superlative Holly-
wood actress and the most fantastic of
Hollywood monsters.
“The Unsinkable Bette Davis” was a
well-stocked scrap-book of her career,
and very neatly compiled. The produ-
cers rejected a straight chronological re-
construction of the life and loves of
Miss Davis in favor of a more compre-
hensive personality portrait, on and off
screen (although there is precious little
difference). Illustrating from her movies
and television interviews, from newsreels
and candid film of her domestic life,

they brought the Davis myth into per-
spective, without attempting any spoken
assessment of her as a talent or an indi-
vidual. Carefully edited montage se-
quences, chronicling one Davis mood by
cutting together similar moments from
several films, showed her versatility at
its hollowest—there was a sameness
about her poses and her gestures. In-
terestingly, they used different scenes
from the same movie, notably Wyler’s
“The Letter”, in the one montage, cut
in amongst other material, and creating
the impression that they were from
different films, but only further empha-
sising the similarity of her performances.
It was as though Bette Davis had made
one long film, with a few thousand
costume and makeup changes, a few
hundred lovers and murders, and a
dozen or so resurrections, but preser-
ving all the time the continuity of per-
formance, until she and director Robert
Aldrich turned round and burlesqued it
all in “Whatever Happened to Baby
Jane?”. This same montage technique
allowed the producer to superimpose the
soundtrack of one Bette Davis scene
over the image of a scene from a differ-
ent movie, thereby simulating her own
comments on herself, or one character's
on another.
Whatever happened to Bette Davis is
still happening. She is still making
films (her latest has Paul Henreid, her
lover in the famous “Now Voyager”, as
director), and she is still as aggressively
independent as when she took on War-
ner Brothers single-handed twenty-odd
years ago. With seventy-three films
behind her, Bette Davis refuses to be a
veteran. She is indeed as “unsinkable”
as a royal barge, and this programme
was as good as any attempt to present
so large a personality as Bette Davis
could be. What it lacked in honest state-
ment it made up for in implication, and
it got as close as she would permit to
this somehow awesome woman that
director Michael Curtiz once called a
“God-damned nothing no-good
sexless son-of-a-bitch”.
Producer Henri Safran was hard put
to save the reputation he won in the
ABC’s “Season in Hell” in his handling
of Donald Bull’s pedestrian study of
middle-class martyrdom, “A Sound of
Trumpets”. This banal story, of an in
sufferable do-gooder and his equally
insufferable family of long-suffering
stereotypes faced with practising what
they preach in the adoption of a refugee
boy, rubbed its second-hand humanity in
the audience's face with all the subtlety
of Sonny Liston wielding a nine-pound
hammer. Only Janice Dinnen’s re-
markably mature performance as the
eldest daughter and Ethel Gabriel’s
complaining grandmother achieved any
semblance of sympathy or credibility.

RED PAGE
Rhodesia’s Welensky
The end of Federation
By IAIN MACLEOD
{former UK Colonial Secretary)
Welensky’s 4000 Days. Sir Roy
Welensky. Collins. 465.*
HThe most important and revealing sen-
A tence in Sir Roy Welensky’s book
comes on the second page. Welensky
is referring to Creech-Jones, Secretary
of State for the Colonies in the Labor
Government: “Many Rhodesians, I
know, will be surprised, but I rate
him as one of the few men I have met
in public life whose word is his bond.”
It is an astonishing comment to come
from someone who has for many years
known every important person in the
Commonwealth. It tells us more about
the writer than the whole of the rest of
the book. Or rather it condenses the
rest of the book into this one sentence.
Almost everyone (except Welensky and
his allies) is unprincipled. This is the
pathetic message of the 4000 days.
Sir Roy is concerned, then, to depict
himself as the hero, calm, strong, steady-
eyed, confronting an endless succession
of broken, shattered British Ministers.
And so we read of Macmillan (“the tears
rolled down”), Butler (“close to col-
lapse"), Sandys (“in sullen despair”), and
myself (“in a state of nerves’’). Perhaps
the pleasantest fantasy (script by John
Roberts, production by Sir Roy) is the
dramatic scene where John Roberts
watches with unbelieving eyes the spec-
tacle of a Secretary of State on the edge
of a breakdown. As Sir Winston
Churchill once observed in another con-
text: “It would be hard to state with
greater precision the exact opposite of
the truth.”
The same dream colors all his judg-
ments of British politicians. Like a small
boy playing cops and robbers he judges
them by one test only: whether they
believed in the Federation in general and
in Welensky in particular. By these stand-
ards Lord Colyton (equally unknown as
Henry Hopkinson) becomes a statesman
and a cop; Maudling (“completely
ignorant about Africa . . . neither strong
enough nor independent enough . . . ”)
is, of course, a robber. Sir Robert Armi-
tage, Governor of Nyasaland at the time
of the emergency, is a cop; Sir Glyn
Jones, who succeeded him and is now to
be the first Governor-General of Malawi,
is dismissed with a crude sneer. Yet
Jones was not only by far the abler of
the two Governors but established at once
a close relationship with Dr Banda.
The Governors of Northern Rhodesia,
Sir Arthur Benson and Sir Evelyn Hone,
men of real calibre, are both disparaged.
Only those who could be bullied or
cajoled or hoodwinked by Welensky are
cops. All Secretaries of State are robbers.
So are Lord Devlin, Lord Monckton and
Lord Shawcross. Salisbury is top cop:
Macmillan the chief robber. As the
tedious story goes on and Welensky
finds himself with fewer and fewer
friends, the hysteria of his argument
mounts. Accusations of breach of faith
are hurled almost daily at British Minis-
ters, British judges, British civil ser-
vants. From anyone else these charges
would be so serious that they would
merit a detailed reply.
ITVd read this book is enough to know
that it would be a waste of time.
There is the one short, deadly sentence
in the comment on Dingle Foot’s private
and privileged interview with Dr Banda
in a prison cell at Gwelo in Southern
Rhodesia: “Mr Foot was alone for some
time with Dr Banda . . .” and there fol-
lows a long and detailed transcript of
their interview. What other explanation
is there other than that the cell had been
“bugged”?
And it is still hard to believe, even
as one reads the account of it in his
book, that Sir Roy would make use of
and advertise his use of such information
obtained by a trick. It is perhaps worth
noting that when Welensky sought to
make charges of breach of faith in 1960
against Lord Monckton (of all people!)
on the basis of what passed between Dr
Banda and his legal adviser, he was
challenged by a Tory MP to say whether
he had a transcript obtained by a listen-
ing device. Sir Roy denied it. What does
he say now?
Or again, Sir Roy uses Cabinet memo-
randa, private letters, versions of pri-
vate conversations, some of them of sus-
picious length and detail, without asking
for permission, without caring that by
doing so he destroys the faith that Mini-
sters must have that their State discus-
sions are not to be told at all, much less
half-told. Sir Roy Welensky, Member of
Her Majesty's Most Honorable Privy
Council, Knight Commander of the Most
Distinguished Order of St Michael and
St George, believes that he has different
standards from those of the men he
dealt with in British public life. He is
quite right. He has.
There is one piece of bugaboo which
perhaps should receive a short reply.
Welensky produces two quite different
versions of what he alleges to be a
build-up of British forces to attack the
whites in Northern Rhodesia. Now he
has discovered a third. He said last
week at London Airport that he had been
told “on extremely good authority that
Macleod was the man who ordered the
plan to go ahead.”
In the book the villain of one story
is the War Office, of the other Harold
Macmillan. Now apparently I was Com-
mander-in-Chief. Sir Roy has been so
manly, so open, so frank, so reputable
in his revelations that perhaps he could
give us the name of this “extremely good
authority”. Otherwise he must excuse me
if I think it just possible that the story
was nothing more than a diversion from
the awkward questions that were being
pressed on him by reporters. Certainly
this mysterious “authority” must have
produced this new information recently,
otherwise, it would have been in the
book. Who is he, please?
In any case, all these stories are non-
sense. Of course every serious situation
in Commonwealth or international affairs
calls for endless contingency planning
against disturbances, especially when, as
in 1961, the cauldron of the Congo was
so close to Northern Rhodesia. The Bri-
tish Government no more contemplated
using troops against the Northern Rhode-
sians then than they do against the
Southern Rhodesians now.
The book deals with the past and con-
cludes with some inconsequent thoughts
about the future. It is an apologia and
not history, and so it fails to answer the
real question. Why did we all fail, for
fail we did, to make Federation succeed?
Was it always doomed to failure? It is
fashionable now to say that it was, but
I do not agree. For myself I was still
a believer in Federation when I left the
Colonial Office in the autumn of 1961.
But I did not believe in Welensky and
I thought his United Federal Party was
the sham that the Northern Rhodesian
elections finally proved it to be. One day
there may be a new Federation.
It may even be wider in scope than the
old Central African Federation. It was
not Federation itself that was wrong.
*This book will become available in
Australia at the end of July.


When Dr Banda stormed, as he often
did, against “this stupid Federation”, I
think he put as much emphasis on the
first word as on the other two. But the
Federation Welensky wanted was always
doomed. He tried to equate belief in the
Federation with belief in himself. Federa-
tion could have succeeded if there had
been any real action by Welensky and
the United Federal Party to match the
fine words about partnership. But what
little there was was too late.
Sir Roy is a much more reasonable
man than lan Smith, the present Premier
of Southern Rhodesia, but when lan
Smith says that he does not expect to
see an African majority in his lifetime,
Welensky’s heart echoes the words in
hope. The British Government of course
made mistakes, but the only really seri-
ous mistake was that we gave Welensky
too many, not too few chances. So we
tried too hard to meet him over minor
points in the Northern Rhodesian Con-
stitution. We consulted him too much
and even though we took little enough
of his advice the African nationalists
grew suspicious. On almost every point
Welensky has already been proved wrong
about both Northern Rhodesia and
Nyasaland. He could never see that Dr
Banda and Dr Kaunda were in fact
the most moderate of the African lead-
ers in the northern territories, and that
it must be wise to encourage them. His
book is full of repetitive tendentious
whining about them both. I should make
it clear that I had regard and respect
for the UFP members in Nyasaland, and
I often wished that Michael Blackwood
in particular lived in a bigger pond.
I do not mean that he agreed with me.
Nearly always he did not. But he dis-
agreed fiercely and cleanly,'and when the
test came at the Nyasaland Conference
he met and accepted openly the chal-
lenge of African rule. The leaders of
the UFP in Northern Rhodesia counted
for nothing. John Roberts, their leader,
was pleasant and weak and completely
overawed by Welensky. I can’t even re-
call the names of any of the others. The
Liberal Party leaders, Sir John Moffat
and Harry Franklin, were able and mod-
erate men. In the atmosphere of 1961
that was enough to ensure their re-
jection.
Negotiating at first or second hand
with Welensky was a weary routine.
Every prospect to start with was “fun-
damentally unacceptable”. Similar
phrases occur over and over again in his
book. I remember suggesting in my early
days as Colonial Secretary that we might
save a lot of money on signals if one
symbol stood for “Welensky and White-
head are completely opposed to all your
suggestions”. Welensky never conceded
anything until he found himself in the
last ditch, and then he conceded every-
thing. In the event the Constitution that
emerged for Northern Rhodesia was a
complicated compromise. It was meant
to be. “Parity of abuse” was my answer
when a group of Commonwealth corres-
pondents asked me what my aim was.
It was a phrase from my days as Min-
ister of Labor.
Sometimes, then, in what seemed a
hopeless impasse, if one could achieve
a solution that pleased no one but that
both sides were forced to try out, peace
might follow. Both Maudling, who suc-
ceeded me as Secretary of State, and my-
self had exactly the same object. We
were prepared to give Welensky his
chance. If he could produce even a
moderate-sized African following of
“reasonable men” the UFP would win
the election. If he could not, Kenneth
Kaunda would be Chief Minister for a
time and then Prime Minister of an
independent Zambia. Kaunda’s support-
ers were, of course, disappointed at
first, but he always saw the possibilities
for UNIP in the new Constitution and
in the end he persuaded them to fight
the elections. He met the challenge and
he won. Welensky, too, knew that he was
being challenged and knew that his bluff
had been called.
What sort of man is Welensky? Very
charming, very plausible, very unreal.
The truth is that he likes Africans as
little as they like him. His attitude has
always been the same. Partnership —-
of course. But in Lord Malvern’s sense
of the word: the partnership between
the rider and the horse, the European
and the African. He has learned nothing,
he wants to learn nothing of the new
Africa.
Tf only he had been brave enough, he
A could have played the role that the
young Winston Churchill cast him for
in an article in the “Queen” magazine
when reporting a year ago on his flying
trip round Africa:
Sir Roy Welensky is in a position
to emulate the Duke of Wellington
who, seeing at the time of the Great
Reform Bill that refusal to retreat
from his position could only bring
disaster, gave the order: “My Lords,
about turn!” Welensky is an able and
much respected man and he, more
than anyone else, could turn Southern
Rhodesia back on to the road of co-
operation. He is also a big enough man
to face and bear the odium that this
would bring upon him from some fel-
low settlers.
Stranger things have happened than
that this strange man will be called back
to politics in his country. It would be a
confession of despair by Southern
Rhodesians, and it could be an overture
to disaster. His book shows why. How,
after what he has written and said about
them, can he talk with the African lead-
ers, Dr Banda and Dr Kaunda, who
will be independent Prime Ministers of
Commonwealth countries? How can he
now expect British Ministers to deal with
him in confidence? How can he change
his spots? For, if he is to succeed, he
must face the scorn and open contempt
of many of his countrymen. Only brave
men do that.
Inside the Master
Dickens and Kafka. Mark Spilka.
Dennis Dobson. 455.
Dickens and Education. Philip Collins.
Macmillan. 68s.
T)rofessor Spilka’s Dickens is decid-
edly dark; and to be plunged pre-
cipitously, as one is in his book, into
critical deeps where David Copperfield
can sometimes sound like “The Ring of
the Nibelungs”, or a play by Eugene
O’Neill, makes for some scepticism.
Slightly off-putting, too, are Professor.
Spilka’s patter of psychological terms and
a pressure-pak style. These are minor
blemishes though, and the reward of per-
severance with this book is to be shown
some very striking below-surface affinities
between Dickens and Kafka. In an early
chapter, entitled “Fathers and Sons”, for
instance, Professor Spilka brings together,
in a mutually illuminating comparison,
Kafka’s story “The Metamorphosis,” and
the episode in “David Copperfield” where
David, having bitten the hand of his step-
father, Murdstone, is banished to his
room for five days’ imprisonment. How
David is metamorphosed into Kafka’s
beetle, how Kafka’s story sharpens and
intensifies the drama of oedipal conflict
in the Dickens, are skilfully and convinc-
ingly demonstrated by Professor Spilka.
In a more extensive comparative
analysis of “David Copperfield” and
“Amerika” (the early novel which Kafka
himself described as “a sheer imitation
of Dickens”) Professor Spilka shows
how, in both novels, the initial family
conflict is re-enacted in various ways in
the larger spheres of society and com-
merce. David Copperfield’s relations
with the various women are neatly
fitted into this account, and the pat-
term of development here provides a
useful guide to fuller understanding
of Kafka’s intentions in “Amerika”.
(I myself feel that the “psycholo-
gical journey”, as described by Profes-
sor Spilka, is a less sustained and
unifying element in “David Copperfield”


than is claimed in this study. But the
journey is there, and it is worth follow-
ing up.) Another link between Dickens
and Kafka, which is discussed in con-
nection with these (and later) novels, is
their predilection for grotesque comedy.
Professor Spilka relates his comedy to the
child-perspective employed by both nove-
lists, and argues that its function is not
distortion but “an apprehension of reality,
a way of getting at the truth”.
“Bleak House” and “The Trial” are
the novels brought together in the final
major comparison in this study. Exter-
nal evidence of Kafka’s dependence on
Dickens here is lacking, but Professor
Spilka points to a number of detailed
similarities in the texts, and the spraw-
ling legal metaphor, common to both
novels, provides a fruitful basis for com-
parison of Dickens’ and Kafka’s worlds
of injustice. The fact that there are
profound differences as well as similari-
ties between these worlds is not over-
looked by Professor Spilka; and one of
the strengths of this study is, precisely,
that essential distinctions are preserved
whilst comparisons which enrich our
understanding of both novelists are
made.
Mr Collins is a little donnish and
patronising about Dickens, and poor
Dickens sometimes fails his examina-
tions rather miserably, being “intellectu-
ally banal”, “lacking in intellectual
rigor”, “earnest and well-intentioned”
but “naive”.
Given its subject, “Dickens and Edu-
cation” ought to be a more interesting
book than it is. Certainly there is some
worthwhile reading in some of the later
chapters where Mr Collins provides
lively background information on such
institutions as Dotheboys Hall and Salem
House. But the book as a whole doesn’t
seem to me quite to jell; and, as Mr
Collins ruefully says in the concluding
chapter, many of his main ideas have
already been formulated by Humphry
House in “The Dickens World”. Mr
Collins’ conclusion that Dickens’ main
contribution to educational reform was
not so much in effecting specific changes
as in helping to create a climate of
opinion in which the child’s world was
more sympathetically understood, is
arrived at with scholarly care. But it
hardly seems a book-length idea.
A. M. GIBBS
Frailty
Jill. Philip Larkin. Faber. 265.
T)hilip Larkin is one of the best poets
writing in English. For some people
this may be a depressing fact; for many
of us it can only be extremely hearten-
ing. For Larkin is a poet who lifts
himself by his own bootstraps. No great
tradition stands at his beck and call;
his poems are written without a buttress-
ing of belief, without recourse to the
props of mythology, without borrowings
from the bright glass cases of the Ima-
ginary Museum. In Larkin’s poetry we
see the furthest development of English
empiricism—simple home truths, unvar-
nished and unadorned. His concerns
are modest, but he pursues them scrupu-
lously and with a good deal of the art
which conceals art.
Larkin may well have made history
in being the first poet in history to be a
completely urban man. No poet before
him—not even Auden—seems to have
been so wholly free from nostalgia for
the rural, the natural, the “organic” life.
Poets from Jonson and Pope to Baud-
elaire and Eliot have retained the yard-
stick of nature against which to judge
the values of urban society. For Larkin,
however, natural man is urban man: in
one of his best early pieces, “Poetry of
Departures”, he denounces the romanti-
cism of escape fantasies and even his
most bucolic poem, “At Grass”, keeps
in touch with hard fact by portraying
pensioned-off racehorses.
His best poems, “Church Going”, “I
Remember, I Remember”, “Wedding
Wind”, “The Whitsun Weddings”, and
two or three others, are achievements
which resemble those of no other post-
war writer. Many younger poets have
imitated, with scant success, the note
of “Church Going”:
Yet stop / did: in fact I often do,
And always end much at a loss
like this
Wondering what to look for; won-
dering, too,
When churches fall completely out
of use,
What we shall turn them into.
The imitators of Larkin generally look
narrow, provincial, incompetent and dull
—none of which he is, by any means.
To go along with his new book of
poetry, “The Whitsun Weddings”, Faber
have reissued “Jill”, the novel Larkin
wrote at twenty-one (he describes it
himself as an “unambitious short story”
and adds an introduction about his
Oxford days which is notable for some
vignettes of the youthful Kingsley Amis).
“Jill” is a frail little novel about a dull
working-class kid from a grey northern
town who is crammed by a dreadful
teacher, with the result that he gets a
scholarship to Oxford. Too young, too
uncomprehending, he struggles through
his first term back in the early years of
World War 11. If John Kemp had been
portrayed as an Angry Young Man, the
book would have been insufferable
(social gaffes; meeting with ex-public
school phoneys; gestures of rebellion and
so on): fortunately, he is just a Hopeless
Young Man. He is sponged on and in-
sulted by students who cannot under-
stand him, and do not try to; but then
he makes a poor fist of understanding
them, finishing up with a sad patch of
drunken aggressiveness.
Kemp, poor sod though he is, shows
an unexpected strain of imagination in
acquiring a defence mechanism: he in-
vents a young sister called Jill, queen-
ing it over a posh girls’ school. He in-
vests a lot of imaginative capital in his
creation, only to find a real Jill show up
in Oxford. Result—chaos.
“Jill” could hardly be slighter, but it
is all done without fudging or faking.
Larkin’s prose is good, his eye for detail
excellent, his general manner a little like
that of Roy Fuller. The book is a good
training centre for his poetry and might
at least whet our appetites for “The
Whitsun Weddings”.
CHRIS WALLACE-CRABBE
Siren Song
The Three Sirens. Irving Wallace.
Cassell. 325. 9d.
The Oscar. Richard Sale. Cassell.
325. 9d.
11/1R Irving Wallace, producer of such
past improbabilia as “The Prize”
and “The Chapman Report”, continues
in “The Three Sirens” to play the popu-
lariser like the true representative of
American mass culture that he is. In
previous work, Wallace has exhibited a
remarkable ability to gauge what makes
a book a popular success and candidate
for book club honors. It is true that
the major ingredient can be summed up
in three letters, but the erotic pill is
nicely wrapped and sugar-coated and
the meticulously interwoven detail is
such that any reader who wants to can
convince himself it contains more sub-
stance than there actually is.
Wallace’s abilities as a researcher are
marked in this novel of anthropological
fable. He claims four years of research
and interviews with eleven of America’s
leading anthropologists, and his invoking
of the deities past and present of the
anthropological set lends a sort of
spurious authenticity to some of the
background detail.
It is when Wallace comes to create his
characters that he gets into trouble. The
anthropological team which makes a six
weeks’ visit to “The Three Sirens”, a
group of uncharted islands in Polynesia,
for the purpose of studying the sexual
mores of its population “uncontaminated
by civilisation” is as mixed a bag of
neurotics as is possible to imagine outside
an institution; and they behave for the
most part in such a markedly unscien-


tific manner that someone should ask to
see their credentials.
“The Three Sirens” is the latest in a
long line of fictional Utopias which
stretches from “Plato's Republic”,
through “Shangri-La” and “Erewhon”
until it reaches the present book, which
really is nowhere. Whereas other Utopias
were notable for attaining high develop-
ment of man’s intellectual capacities,
grandeur of the spirit or overcoming the
process of age, “The Three Sirens’ ” con-
tribution lies in its sexual licence. Some
of the sexual habits are not too unlike
many practised in parts of Polynesia
today, but there are extravagant flights
of imaginative fancy which manage to
embrace most of the better known sexual
methods and aberrations. No wonder
everyone is so happy with such good
clean fun at the Social Aid hut (where
unfulfilled husbands can go for satisfac-
tion) and the annual week-long festival
(a free-for-all involving nude beauty
contests and suspended marriages).
Though everyone on the Sirens behaves
like savages, there is the added spice
that they are all part-English, this Utopia
having been founded a century or so
before by an Englishman named Daniel
Wright whose dream was to “produce a
radically new form of matrimony
superior to anything of earth.”
The proposition posed by all this is:
if you’re sexually happy, you’re in para-
dise. What does it matter if you are
circumscribed by taboos and supersti-
tions, and remain illiterate and diseased
while man outside is pushing back the
frontiers of the mind and of medicine?
The anthropological party seems to
accept this proposterous premise and
enters wholeheartedly into the life of the
community. What’s more, they all gain
from the experience: Dr Maud Hayden
who regains her anthropological self, her
daughter-in-law Claire who finds sexual
happiness and fills her need for children
with a local resident, the psychoanalyst
Rachel DeJong who overcomes her sexual
inhibitions with the help of a forceful
native on the beach in three inches of
water; and so on throughout the party.
The only loser seems to be Claire's hus-
band and Maud's son Marc who goes
crazy from a combination of desire for
a native girl and for wealth, and con-
veniently throws himself over a cliff.
It would be nice to think that there
was some message to be drawn from all
this, some illumination of the truths of
our own society, and Mr Wallace informs
us on this jacket that this was indeed his
purpose as the Sirens is a “large mirror
for showing up the deformities of our
own cherished beliefs and customs’’. One
of those mirrors usually found in fun-
fairs, presumably.
In “The Oscar” Richard Sale does for
Hollywood's annual awards what Irving
Wallace did for the Nobel Prize. As
the Swedish institution managed to sur-
vive “The Prize”, there is no reason to
suppose that this novel will do much
further damage to the prestige of the
Hollywood carnival, already suspect be-
cause of its method of choosing the win-
ners and the stature of the w'inners
themselves.
This then is another novel about Holly-
wood, a subject which has been done
definitively by Nathaniel West, Scott
Fitzgerald and Budd Shulberg and vari-
ously manhandled by a whole battalion
of lesser writers. Let us agree from the
start that there is nothing real about “The
Oscar”; it is not so much about Holly-
wood as about the myth the movies have
created about it. This is not too sur-
prising a conclusion when it is considered
that the author has been associated with
34 films as scriptwriter or director and
doubtless this one could finish up on
celluloid (B and unsuitable for children).
The anti-hero (non-sympathetic, no
background, a real scrambler) is Frank
Fane who would be the world’s biggest
louse if there were anything real about
him. Fortunately, like all the other
characters, he is more of a caricature.
The story concerns his efforts to dis-
credit the other Oscar-nominees and win
the gold statuette for himself, during
which he destroys, brutalises, slanders,
blackmails and otherwise misuses his
wife, two friends, three bedmates, and a
whole host of enemies and other ac-
quaintances.
The style is a mixture of Hollywood-
style hipster talk and name-dropping,
replete with semi-historical footnotes and
tiresome information about personalities
the author has worked with. For all his
machinations, Frank Fane, boy Machia-
velli, has a few surprises in store on
Oscar presentation night, as does the
reader who finds himself rather puzzled
how things came out the way they did.

Peace in Their Time. Emery Kelen.
Gollancz. 345. 9d.
Memoirs (Volume 11). Alexandre
Benois. Chatto & Windus. 495. 9d.
rFHis is a remarkably entertaining inter-
national portrait-gallery of rogues
and other notables spanning the years
between 1914-1945. The Hungarian-
American cartoonist Emery Kelen has
been among the world’s leading car-
toonists for 30 years or more, cutting
down the notorious and the great with
his merciless pen.
In the ’twenties, he had only to take
a job as sports caricaturist on a Munich
paper, “Football”, to find he had acci-
dentally booked himself a front seat for
the drilling of the first Nazi troops (who
chose the backyard of the printery for
their military exercises). He had only
to look through a hole in the wall of the
office to come face to face with the
editorial staff of the “Voelkischer Beo-
bachter”, including a certain “man with
a silly moustache” known as Adolf.
Kelen was present at the rise and fall
of the League of Nations. And at the
Battle of Caporetto in World War I he
had been an unwilling “sack of potatoes
with the rank of Lieutenant” fighting
none less than the combined forces of
Hemingway, “a military bandleader
named Arturo Toscanini, Phillip Noel-
Baker, Nobel Prize winner and a bemus-
tached sergeant in the medical corps,
Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, later Pope
John XXIII”.
Fed up with war, he feigned madness
because “insane behavior is but a cari-
cature of the sane”; but he was so con-
vincing that he almost exchanged his
temporary uniform for a permanent
padded cell.
The late Alexandre Benois, a stage
designer, wrote Volume II of his
memoirs in 1909, leaving unchronicled
50 more years of ballet and work for the
great opera houses of Milan, Paris,
Covent Garden and others.
He wends a leisurely course from old
St Petersburg to Paris, evoking the dusty
smell of red plush theatres and stale
greasepaint, but the sense of balance
and proportion one would expect in a
famous designer are missing in his
writing. There are huge frustrating
gaps. Little things are often recounted
in detail while big ones may be only
dimly remembered.
Benois recalls what his small daugh-
ters wore on their first visit to the
theatre down to the last hair-ribbon,
and probably more reliably than the cast
of a “Tristan and Isolde” he heard at
Covent Garden which allegedly starred
both de Rezskes and Madame Melba.
If Melba ever sang Isolde, then I am the
Flying Dutchman! My guess is that it
was Lilli (not Lotte) Lehmann.
Those parts dealing with the founding
of the Ballets Russes are perhaps the
most interesting, including Benois’ first
meeting with such dancers as Isadore
Duncan and the young Pavlova and his
accounts of the Diaghilev intrigues (the
sort of thing about which Nijinsky’s w'ife
also wrote at length long ago). There
is a foreword by former ballerina Tamara
Karsavina.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Once-over from London
The London “Economist's” favorable review of Australia
and its recommendation of a list of key shares had a
salutary effect on the Australian Stock Exchanges last
week, helping to reverse the weakening trend which developed
after Dr Coombs’ warning of the need for more restrained
growth. If Australian stocks were good enough for overseas
investors, then they were good enough for a local nibble.
Australians always take more notice when an outside
opinion is given, possibly because of some unwillingness to
trust their own judgment. So a keen eye was cast over “The
Economist’s” recommendations, which plumped noticeably for
retail stocks because of population growth and rising living
standards. The Bulletin has been pushing the retail line
for some time and, although noting the merit of the overseas
selections of Myer, G. J. Coles and Woolworths, would not
leave out David Jones, if only because of its consistently
high earning rate. Nor should Myer (SA) be overlooked.
“The Economist” favors breweries, yet includes only Carlton
and United Breweries in its key list of 14 stocks, although
giving a mention to Swan Brewery in Western Australia.
Swan, incidentally, has been mentioned locally as the brewery
best suited for takeover because of capital structure.
Pastoral companies don’t rate highly with “The Economist”,
which, after expressing the opinion elsewhere that commodity
prices may have run their upward course, suggests that it
would be more appropriate to buy pastoral shares after a
recession.
Doubtless influenced by the very effective use of the flexible
interest rate in Britain, “The Economist” suggests that Aus-
tralia’s recent increase in interest rates would make the banks
more competitive with the
finance companies. Possibly this
does not give sufficient weight
to the control of trading bank
funds by the Reserve Bank and
the ability of the finance com-
panies (whose interest rates are
not controlled) to obtain an
overflow of business from the
banks. But the intensive com-
petition among the finance com-
panies, and the problems indi-
cated by recent bad debts, could
influence investment attitudes
here.
Bank of NSW, therefore, gets
into the list of growth pros-
pects along with the steel giant,
BHP.
Melbourne stocks predomi-
nate, including “Herald and
Weekly Times”, Repco, Natio-
nal Consolidated, Johns and
Waygood, ICIANZ.

Mixed Concrete, doubtless glowing in the reflection of the
successful UK company, also is tipped, with the directors
expected to try harder after rejecting the recent CSR-
RMC(UK) merger offer of 16s.
The list is impressive, although anyone looking for income
returns will be sadly disappointed, because the average yield
appears to be less than 3 p.c. (See also “Croesus” review,
page 58).
Europe Buys Cheap Beef
From Britain
Tf you eat beef in Britain these days, you are saving money
A for the Exchequer. Why? Because the world shortage
of beef has boosted prices everywhere, including the protected
UK market, thus reducing the need to subsidise UK farmers.
The UK Treasury pays a subsidy to British farmers to give
them a “fair” market price in competition with imported beef.
This subsidy can be expensive to the Treasury when im-
ported meat sells cheaply on the UK market, thus lowering
the market price available to the British meat producer. But
beef is short this year. Argentina, which is Britain's largest
supplier, has less beef available after last year’s drought and
is trying to meet the heavy and lucrative demands from
Europe as well as Britain.
Europe, noting that domestic meat was relatively cheap in
Britain, started to buy on the British market, thus forcing up
prices to a level where the cur-
rent guaranteed farmer's price
of 184 s. per live hundredweight
is not much higher than the
open market price.
With Argentina supplying
more than 60 p.c. of Britain’s
beef, other suppliers were forced
to attempt other markets, with
the result that, when Argentina’s
beef started to run short, there
were no ready supplies avail-
able. With the British Ministry
of Agriculture pursuing a
scheme designed to keep prices
down at home, including a
penalty on meat imported above
a certain price, European buyers
saw an opportunity to buy cheap
meat in Britain.
Now everyone is confused.
The Ministry of Agriculture
estimates that only 3 or 4 p.c.
of domestic beef production is
finding its way across the Eng-
lish Channel, but it is enough
to make the planners look a
little foolish. It also highlights


the remarkably high prices which are being paid to UK
farmers by way of subsidy in periods of shortage as well as
plenty.
Traditional suppliers who accepted artificially low prices
for “guaranteed” supplies are inclined to feel irritated. The
present situation is said to be of short duration, because the
seasonal influx of North European beef will appear on the
market shortly, while shipments from Argentina are expected
to be stimulated by current high prices.
All, So! Now Can Translate
Those Naughty Words
decision by the Victorian Employers’ Federation to set up
a language laboratory should be welcomed by business-
men who hope to extend their trade relations with Asian
countries. The laboratory will use the latest type of electronic
teaching aids.
Too often in the past the emissary from the West has been
rubbished because he apparently refused to make any effort
to learn the local language.
TV conditioning, where everyone who fails to speak Eng-
lish is a foreigner (or a baddie), should be tossed overboard.
If the effort is made to learn a local language, there can be
no doubt of its value in understanding local attitudes as well
as assisting sales.
UK Is Losing Sales
On Two Fronts
rjESPiTE rising export sales to the sterling area in April
(notably Australia), the upsurge in industrial demand in
Britain is putting pressure on the trade gap, with import
replacements making their presence felt. Many manufacturers
who were living hand to mouth met the sudden rise in orders
by importing their materials. Steel, for example, after a
period of recession, could not meet the immediate demand
and, while plants got back into production, steel users imported
at least 100,000 tons.
Not all the sudden rise in imports came from re-stocking
of raw materials. Figures for the first three months of 1964
reveal that the major imports were machinery and semi-
manufactured goods. This mostly reflects renewed capital
investment, but those machinery and equipment orders were
lost to UK makers. A major surprise is the import of cars
and automotive equipment.
One explanation is that, after a period of stagnation, British
machinery manufacturers are not geared to supply orders for
modern equipment, such as in the machine tools division.
Although UK manufacturers may contest this point, there
is no doubt that the users of such equipment have seen fit
to obtain supplies elsewhere, either for price reasons or
technical advances.
With imports rising, estimates are being canvassed of an
annual deficit of around £2oom. on current account.
Financial commentators are saying that, with the prospect
of a Labor Government after October, long-term investment
in Britain has been curtailed.
So far there is no real evidence of a flight of sterling to
other areas of investment, such as Australia, and the Tories
claim they are not giving up their chances at the next election.
Outsiders appear to be more critical, viewing the widening
trade gap against a background of rising imports of manu-
factured and semi-manufactured goods, a prospective Labor
Government, and Britain’s failure to sell prestige equipment
such as ships, aircraft and specialised machinery. They say
British exporters have failed to measure up to the preseni
specialised need for marketing and promotion in accord wit!
the local requirements of each export area.
India’s Planning Mechanism
Needs Improving
M R . Nehru’s lamented death should not radically change the
direction of India’s economic policy unless the country’s
international relations, notably with Communist China, worsen
suddenly. The new Prime Minister, Mr Lai Bahadur Shastri,
is politically almost exactly in the centre.
He can be expected to preserve that balance between the
private and public sectors which is the doctrinal foundation
of the successive Five Year Plans.
When the first of these was started, in 1951, already exist-
ing industries were mostly left in the hands of private business.
Public planning concerned itself largely with utilities, power,
irrigation and the establishment of three new steel plants under
American, British and Russian sponsorship.
Agriculture received concentrated early attention, in an
attempt to reduce India’s reliance on outside supplies. Though
industry now demands greater emphasis, it must be recognised
that agriculture remains basic to getting the Indian economy
properly moving.
In this light the third and current Plan, still with about two
years to run, is proving something of a disappointment. A
national growth rate at some 3 p.c. looks meagre against the
forecast 6 p.c.
Worse still, the 1963-64 economic survey had to admit a
3.3 p.c. decline in the vital agricultural output during the
1962-63 season. Lower crops of rice, sugarcane and wheat
also began to push up consumer prices.
Even industrial growth rates stay below expectations, though
at least production did increase during 1962-63 when com-
pared with the previous year. But the Finance Minister, Mr
T. T. Krishnamachari, was forced once more to elaborate on
the fundamental position of agriculture.
A number of critics find it rather odd, keeping the un-
enlivening third Plan in mind, that blueprints for the fourth
Five Year Plan talked about a 7.5 p.c. growth rate from 1975
onwards and the vanishing, of foreign financial support by
that year as well.
The magnitude of India’s internal economic problem may
be sensed by realising that a successful fourth Plan would give
the poorest citizen an income of 10s. a week!
Past inadequacies are likely to mean that the “Aid India
Club’ will closely examine the structure of the planning
mechanism in an attempt to put the economy closer to target.
The Club, which has furnished great financial help to India,
comprises the World Bank, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France,
West Germany, Italy, Japan, Holland, the UK and USA.
Building Changes Call For
New Fire Outlook
T’he Building Science Forum of Australia conducted its
A third conference at the Chevron-Hilton, Sydney, on June
9 and 10 and drew attention to the confusion over proper
measures to combat fire in buildings.
Because of the change in height, size and methods of con-
struction, new and different fire hazards have developed.
Regulations sometimes fail to keep up with the new advances
in building techniques while, at times, hastily introduced fire
protection measures are unduly restrictive or lead to un-
reasonable expenses being incurred by the building owner,
claimed Mr J. E. Ferris, consulting engineer.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Problems for the Loan Council
Fixing priorities in the public sector
on the performance of invest-
" ment in the public sector revealed
in the latest estimates of National In-
come and Expenditure, it is evident that
in recently engineering an increase in
interest rates the monetary authorities
have been paying as much, if not more,
attention to an upsurge in capital spend-
ing by public authorities and public
enterprises as they have to signs that
private fixed capital spending is rising
towards flood levels.
It also becomes clear that at the forth-
coming Loan Council meeting the Pre-
miers will find the Federal Treasurer in
a far less accommodating mood to their
demands for increased allocations for
public works than he was last year. The
need to moderate increases in allocations
and to establish clearer priorities for
capital spending in the public sector is
as pressing as to ensure that capital
spending there allows room for the pri-
vate sector's legitimate claims on re-
sources available for investment in the
economy as a whole.
The Federal Treasurer has already
indicated he is thinking in terms of
restraining public sector investment. This
is not so much a question of the availa-
bility of loan funds in 1964-65, to which
the under-subscription to the May loan
and current uncertainties about interest
rates are not necessarily decisive pointers.
It is more a question of resources allo-
cation restraining income generation and
moderating the effects of high investment
on prices and costs. In particular, it is
a question of fitting in a big increase
in defence expenditure in the context of
a clamor for more funds for practically
everything else in the public sector and
a general rise in investment in the rest
of the economy.
IPhe broad dimensions of the tasks
A facing the authorities are apparent
from the trend in the percentage of total
gross fixed capital expenditure to Gross
National Product. This is most accu-
rately gauged by comparing like quarters
in successive years. A quarter by
quarter comparison of this percentage
can be misleading, largely because, in
the second quarter every year, GNP is
abnormally swollen by inclusion of sea-
sonally high amounts for the gross oper-
ating surplus of trading enterprise and,
in the June quarter, capital expenditure
strongly reflects spurts in spending be-
fore the financial year closes. For the
March quarters of the last three years,
the percentage was 22.76 in 1961-62,
23.37 in 1962-63 and 23.7 this year.
Admittedly, by Australian standards,
even a percentage of 23.7 is moderate,
but the upward trend is established and
this is likely to be seen more clearly in
the percentage for the June quarter. The
June quarter showed 27.7 in 1961-62
and 29.2 last year. This year it could
be up to 30 or more (depending mainly
on the extent to which annual allocations
were underspent in the first nine months
of the year and, of course, on the
movement of GNP itself). If this is the
case, it would lift the percentage of
gross fixed capital expenditure to GNP
for 1963-64 above the danger spot of
25, to which it has been edging for the
last two years. It was 23.37 in 1961-62
and 24.25 last year.
On its showing thus far, the upward
movement in this ratio of total gross
fixed capital expenditure to GNP is cer-
tainly strong enough for the authorities
to be closely watching the trend in
capital spending in the public sector and
its relation to gross fixed capital expen-
diture for the economy as a whole. On
that score it would be easy to be de-
ceived by the proportions as revealed by
the annual figures.
Tn the recession year 1961-62, when pri-
vate investment was flat and the pub-
lic sector ,vas carrying a high proportion
of the economy's investment load, the
proportion of total gross fixed capital
expenditure attributable to the public
sector was as high as 37.6. Last year,
when the national total rose from
£1740 million to £1913 million, even
an increase in fixed capital spending
from £655 million to £687 million in the
private sector gave it a proportion of
only 30.7 to the total. In that year the
proportion dropped sharply because the
private sector lifted its contribution from
£lOB5 to £1226 million.
In the first nine months of this year,
however, the public sector has pushed
up its proportion to 34.6 p.c. For
whereas the private sector increased its
fixed capital spending by as much as
9.3 p.c., or from £9OB to £975 million
over the same nine months of 1962-63,
the rise in the public sector was 10.5
p.c., or from £467 to £516 million.
Surprisingly enough, for the March
quarter this year the proportion dropped
slightly to 34.2, compared with 36.2 and
33.2 in the first two quarters this year
and 33.3 in the March quarter last year.
One had been led to believe from the
official figures for fixed capital spending
by industry in the March quarter (see
The Bulletin, May 30) that gross fixed
investment in the private sector rose
only narrowly in that quarter, but the
quarter's estimates of National Income
and Expenditure reveal that it rose by as
much as 8.4 p.c. compared with the
same quarter last year. It turns out that
industrial investment proved to be the
exception to a general lift in private
sector fixed investment. Going on Dr
Coombs’ recent revelations, it has since
been making up arrears in the high
expectations for it.
T'or the rest, compared with the previ-
A ous March quarter, private sector
expenditure on dwellings rose by as
much as £l3 million to £94 million, a
record total for any quarter, and private
expenditure on other new building and
construction increased by £8 million to
£65 million. Together with a rise of
£4 million to £165 million in other
expenditure (including industrial), this
put the total private capital spending for
the quarter up by £25 million. This
compared with a rise of £l6 million in
the public sector, hence the slight drop
to 34.6 p.c. in its share of the total.
However, going on the experience of
previous years, for seasonal reasons this
fall in the percentage for the March
quarter could be deceptive of the real
trend in the public sector's share of gross
fixed capital investment. Between the
March and June quarters 1961-62, gross
fixed capital expenditure in the public
sector rose by 32 p.c. and last year the
rise was as much as 40 p.c. between
these quarters. As previously noted, this
phenomena arises from the rush of
public authorities and enterprises to
spend allocations before the close of
the fiscal year. So we may expect fixed
investment in the public sector to rise
very substantially in the current quarter,
while, also from past experience, the rise
in the private sector's fixed capital spend-
ing may not be commensurately as great.
In the past, urgency to spend before
June 30 has not been nearly as pressing
in the private sector. The rise there
between the March and June quarters
was only 11.1 p.c. in 1961-62 and 10.6
p.c. last year.
The Federal Treasurer has shown him-
self aware of the danger of the public
sector taking more than its appropriate
share of fixed investment resources while,
in his turn, Dr Coombs has sent out
warning signals that, in the context of
the resources available for fixed invest-
ment in the economy as a whole, the
private sector must moderate its own
demands. The Loan Council will have to
take all that into account, not only in
fixing the total amount to be spent by
public authorities and enterprises next
year, but also in deciding the priorities
for allocations within the total.

“CROESUS”
There’ll Always Be Australia
“The Economist ” rediscovers “new dynamism ”
Ane doesn't need to be all that long
in the tooth to remember the early
postwar period when, in the setting of a
fallible sterling area, “The Economist”
newspaper in Britain castigated Austra-
lia for pouring valuable Commonwealth
capital down the drain of a high-cost
industrial boom and assessed us a high-
risk investment. Barbara Ward’s stric-
tures about the weak base to our
economic pyramid in the early 1950 s
were equally jaundiced. Or, going back
less than two years, it will be remem-
bered that Britain was hardly thinking
twice before throwing us to the wolves
in its ill-fated haste to get into the Com-
mon Market.
Now all this is past. Britain has re-
discovered us, not only the UK Govern-
ment but British industry, emigrants,
investors and even “The Economist” too.
This is all to the good, yet, it is
difficult to avoid feeling cynical. It is
not so much that, within the last 18
months, by any international standard
our economic position has become most
attractive. British exporters and inves-
tors would, in any case, have wanted to
be in on that. It is more that the pro-
cess of rediscovery dates roughly from
Britain having failed to get into the
Common Market and has been needled
by the prospect of a Labor Government
being returned in Britain later this year.
In calculating British eyes, we have
suddenly sprouted wings. It is all a bit
too quick for my liking.
It is certainly highly convenient for
the UK to shower attention on us in the
present circumstances of its foreign trade
and domestic politics. The pity is that
this has not been a more consistent atti-
tude over the years, that we have been
taken rather too much for granted by
Britain in the spirit of “there’ll always
be Australia”. It doesn’t surprise me
that, for all the goodwill between the
two countries and even granting that in
recent years strong forces have been
operating to divert trade to other coun-
tries, the run down in Anglo-Australian
trade has been so marked.
The shrinkage in trade has, of course,
been biggest in the percentage of our
exports to the UK, which has dropped
from 31.7 to 18.6 p.c. in the last five
years. In money terms, the drop is
from £255.6 to £200.9 million. Although
exports to the UK increased in money
terms, from £148.2 to £185.5 million in
the nine months to March this year, this
represented a further drop to just under
18 p.c. of our total exports for the
period. Although only by a small mar-
gin, it put the UK in second place to
Japan as an export destination for the
first time (the US was third with slightly
more than 10 p.c., followed by NZ and
Communist China both with 6 p.c.).
rr H is persistent fall in the percentage of
-*• our exports going to Britain is some-
thing we should be much more con-
cerned about officially than appears to
be the case. We should be constantly
reminding the UK Government about
it, not only when Britain is negotiating
entry into the Common Market and
threatening to reduce it further. In the
light of the highly favorable balance the
UK continued to run with Australia on
current account as a result of its big
surpluses both on visible and invisible
exports to this country, it would be a
good idea to make a point of doing so
when the British Trade Fair is on in
Sydney in September.
The facts of this huge surplus the UK
runs with us on current account needs
constant repetition because of Britain’s
efforts to increase its exports here in
the face of our falling sales to the British
market. Last year, the surplus was no
less than £188.6 million, which was only
slightly less than the record £192.5 mil-
lion in 1960-61 (even in the poor year
for imports, 1961-62, it was £98.5 mil-
lion; in 1959-60 it was £160.1 million
and in 1958-59, £118.6 million).
Filling in the reasons for these big
surpluses, Britain’s sales of goods to Aus-
tralia have fallen far less than our sales
to Britain. Even though, in money
terms, UK exports here were little
changed in the latest nine months, Bri-
tain still has around 30 p.c. of the Aus-
tralian import market compared with
only 18 p.c. of our exports going to the
UK. In fact, in 1962-63, imports of
UK origin were higher than in 1958-59
that is, £329.1 million compared with
£307.4 million. In two of the intervening
years they were even higher than last
year.
In the last five, years, the UK has run
visible trade surpluses with Australia
running from as high as £140.5 million
in 1960-61 to a low of £51.8 million in
1958- Last year, the surplus was
£128.2 million and for the first nine
months this year, it was £58.4 million,
a result which, of course, reflects high
prices for Australian exports—mainly
because of this our exports to Britain
rose from £148.2 to £185.4 million for
the period, an increase of about a
quarter.
While the imbalance of visible trade is
the main devil of our current account
balance of payments with the UK, from
our viewpoint, hardly less serious is the
constant drag of the annual net bill for
invisible imports. Our net payments to
the UK for invisibles last year was £BO.B
million, which was just about the same
as in 1960-61 (£80.6 million). Other
figures for the last five years were £58.4
million in 1961-62 (the lowest), £70.5
million in 1958-59 and £74.9 million in
1959- For the first six months of the
current year, invisibles cost us a net
£36.1 million, so with imports more
buoyant in the second half of the year
and exports continuing to hold their
high levels, for the full year invisibles
are likely to be at about last year’s
figure or even higher.
It will be obvious that the only reason
Australia has been able to run a current
account balance-of-payments surplus at
all in some recent years is that exports
to countries other than Britain have
more than counteracted the steady de-
cline in those to Britain. Naturally, if
exports to these third countries are to be
maintained and, as is hoped, expanded,
they will have to be assured of at least
their present shares of the Australian
market.
The British Trade Fair scheduled for
September is Britain's immediate answer
to the threat of further erosion in its
sales to Australia. Also it is certainly
good tactics for the UK to send out its
economic experts from ‘The Economist”
to tell us what a wonderful economy we
have. However, other countries are not
standing idly by either, even if the likes
of Dr Kojima don’t seem to love us as
much as Mr Roland Bird.

MARKET POINTERS
Those Retailers Again
Someone once said that, in selecting
investments you should look closely
at the industry in which the company
operates, check conditions, outside in-
fluences . . . anything which might in-
fluence the welfare of the company.
This layman’s look is independent of
directors’ reports, or gossip.
Sometimes the general impression
given to an outsider can be misleading,
particularly if he is not equipped with
specialised knowledge of an industry.
But anyone who goes shopping in a
Grace Bros, store in Sydney these days
must be impressed with the merchandi-
sing. And, unless the crowds inside the
store are merely sight-seeing, the stores
should be doing good business, too.
The Bulletin has always stressed the
value of Grace Bros., although admit-
ting the market is paying a steep price
for the ss. shares.
So, if retailers are going to benefit
from the current economic expansion,
surely Grace Bros, must get its share.
The £2+ million placement at 20s.
through lan Potter and Co. could disap-
point existing shareholders but the pre-
mium on these shares could mean an
eventual bonus.

Ready Mixed Concrete was
staving off the approaches of CSR-
RMC (UK), it was suggested that one of
the building materials suppliers may try
to protect its flank.
With CSR-RMC (UK) rebuffed, Blue
Metal Industries has now entered the
arena with a £25 million bid which will
cost it 16\ million ss. shares plus 2s. 9d.
cash per share for the 33,038,795 issued
shares of RMC (one BMI share plus
ss. 6d. cash for every 2 RMC shares).
BMl’s big premium on its own
14,385,058 ss. par value shares gives it
a handy weapon in making such a huge
takeover offer, which would lift its paid
capital to nearly £8 million.
The cash part of the offer of £4f
million is not as tremendous as it looks,
because a bidder for Ready Mixed Con-
crete can see several millions in liquid
assets lying in the RMC pool since the
sale of the UK subsidiary, even after
the 2s. return of capital.
At the time of writing, no counter bid
had appeared to match BMl’s offer. But
there must be some worried brows at
certain board room meetings when BMl’s
prospective bigness is considered.
If BMI is successful, it would domi-
nate the NSW market and control at
least half of the Australian market. A
counter-bid in cash would involve
raising more than £25 million and, ex-
cept for CSR and CRA, there are not too
many hefty premium building materials
shares which could be used in a take-
over battle.

Shareholders of Fairymead failed to
obtain much satisfaction at the
annual meeting on why Fairymead’s pro-
fits did not keep pace with the per-
centage increases of other Queensland
sugar companies.
They discovered that the company
bought the 52,600-acre Marlborough
Station at Rockhampton from Sir Rupert
Clark, for grazing cattle. It also bought
16,000 acres of freehold land in NSW,
which might explain last December’s
private placement of 150,000 shares.

"Investors in Queensland were still tip-
ing a bumper result from Moreton
Central Sugar Mill, whose 20s. par value
shares on the Brisbane Stock Exchange
have risen from 645. to 89s. this year.
Yield is only 3.6 p.c. from a 16 p.c.
dividend but, based on the one-third
increase in cane crushings and Queens-
land’s reported average sugar price of
£64 2s. 2d. for 1963, the company
was in a very happy position.
If the shares ease back now that the
two-for-three bonus has been announced
they could still provide some prospects.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Praise for a Prize Larke
of fine company re-
porting have long appreciated the
published accounts of Larke Consoli-
dated Industries Ltd for outstanding
candor and comprehensiveness. They
will therefore be happy to felicitate
Larke on winning the listed company
annual report award for 1963.
It would seem also that Larke has
taken something of a running start
towards the 1964 prize. For from now
on both annual and half-yearly reports
are to rate for judging.
In February last, Larke’s directors
distinguished themselves by covering
three printed pages with an interim state-
ment on the December six - months’
trading. A definite figure for after-tax
group profit was bolstered by general
comment on prospects and the dividend,
then further supported by remarks on
the fortunes of each of the subsidiaries.
Shareholders and investors in general
can derive nothing but benefit when all
entrants begin chasing this kind of
liberal disclosure. The organisers of the
award, the Australian Institute of
Management, work in conjunction with
the Stock Exchanges of Australia. Both
parties are manifestly striving for more
revealing company, information.
Over the 13 years of its existence, the
award has obviously acted as a goal
towards better company reporting,
especially along the lines of greater
intelligibility for interested persons who
lack an exact business training. It has
also served to refine and spread certain
accounting practices, notably in respect
of turnover details and stock valuation.
Since 1962, non-listed organisations
have been brought within the ambit of
an award. The 1963 winner in this
section, the Electricity Trust of South
Australia, gives a broad and well-
illustrated picture of a public utility in
action.
Adjudicators should feel able to con-
gratulate themselves on the higher
standards they are establishing on the
turnover and stock criteria mentioned
above.
Their report mentions that “without
the yardstick of turnover it is difficult
to measure progress”. It goes on to
add: “The great majority of companies
whose reports were selected by the
Stock Exchanges throughout Australia
freely included turnover.”
On stocks, “more and more com-
panies are departing from the meaning-
less ‘cost, or less than cost’, ‘at or below
cost’, ‘lower of cost or market’, ‘cost or
valuation whichever the lower’, and
many variations.
“The winning company goes further
in its note for the heading of stocks
where it says, ‘different trading con-
ditions apply in the various types of
business operated by the group and the
directors have regard to these con-
ditions in fixing what they regard as
proper commercial values in each sub-
sidiary. To arrive at the figure
£1,567,760, each class of stock in each
subsidiary is valued at the lower of cost,
market selling value or replacement
price’.”
Last year’s listed winner, Marcus
Clark and Co., earned a special award
this time. The other “specials” were:

dustries, Felt and Textiles, Hanimex

Records for Younghusband
directors’ forecasts, there should
be good prospects for Young-
husband to go on to new records during
the current 1964-65 year to March 31.
The company, based in Melbourne,
operates as a wool and produce broker
and stock and station agent. Last year,
profit peaked from £240,000 to
£314,000, and the shareholders collected
a 10 p.c. distribution instead of the
previous 8 p.c.
This company’s fortunes rest, almost
exclusively, on seasonal conditions and
wool prices. Both were favorable in
1963-64. In last week’s annual report,
the directors pointed out that the possi-
bility of these factors running into 1964-
65 was very definite.
They said seasonal prospects were
promising because of the recent autumn
rains in Victoria and the Wimmera.
They described the wool statistical
position as “still good” and claimed that
the moderate decline in wool prices
since mid-March had been fairly
gradual.
It should not be forgotten that good
clearances at auction are also essential
for success in this industry, despite the
price. Younghusband has managed to
achieve these so far under what the
directors term a “confident inquiry”.
Thoughts on Kauri’s Dividend
Tn March last year, the directors of the
reconstructed Kauri Holdings, big
timber group, forecast that shareholders
would collect annual dividends of 10
p.c. commencing with the final payment
of 1962-63. In that year to August 31,
profit was around £158,000, which
equalled 10 p.c. on the new capital—
a brilliant reversal from 1961-62 when
a loss of £741,000 was chalked up.
As forecast, the final (and only) pay-
out was 5 p.c., indicating that a full
10 p.c. would be paid in future. How-
ever, there was some dismay among

investors last week when the interim
report predicted that this year’s full
results would be “somewhat better”
than last year, but only declared an
interim dividend of 4 p.c., not 5 p.c. as
they were expecting.
No reason was given for this action
and no mention was made of the
directors’ original 10 p.c. forecast.
What does this indicate? Is it a bad
omen, a good omen or does it carry no
implications at all?
Most probably the answer is that it
carries no implications at all. If profits
are to be “somewhat better” than 1962-
63, then 10 p.c. dividend would be
amply covered. Now that the board
has set the group on a stable level again,
it could very well have decided to
establish the dividend pattern which
numerous companies have adopted a
small interim and a larger final.
Of course this is merely speculation.
Therefore the directors should have
given some indication of what the full
payout would be, confirmed their
original forecast or, at the least, given
some sort of explanation for their action.
Last Desperate Throw
Ohareholders have the answer to the
request by Freightlines and Con-
struction Holding Ltd for fresh capital
in the notice from the company itself.
“Owing to the activities of the Gov-
ernment inspectors, who have been con-
ducting their investigation into the
affairs of the company for the past 10
months, the company has found it im-
possible to raise temporary funds . . .”
Further, the Sydney Stock Exchange
would not consider re-listing the com-
pany’s shares until the investigation was
completed and a report released.
Directors quote a profit of £41,000
(before tax, if any) for the December
half-year. This compares with a profit
of £27,856 in the full year 1 §62-63,
and losses of £49,232 and £41,240 in
the two preceding years.
At last balance date, the company had
a deficiency in reserves of £46,805, and
on performance the ss. shares would not
muster anything like a par valuation if
listed on the market.
It is a last desperate throw for
directors to try now to attract capital by
a two-for-five par issue.
A Sense of Responsibility
a commendable sense of
responsibility to investors and
shareholders in Melbourne last week, the
directors of Drug Houses and Henry
Berry announced that negotiations for
establishing some form of association
between the two companies had ceased
without success. Eight weeks earlier,
they announced that discussions would
take place in an attempt to establish
some amalgamation of interests.
Although the two statements were
vague and non-committal, the share
market knew something was going on
and could exercise its own judgment on
the matter. Dangers of leakage were
prevented and, thus, shareholders were
protected against any better informed
speculators to a large extent. Berry scrip
went from 30s. to 345. 6d. after the
initial report, and then settled back to
295. 9d. before the latest announcement.
Drugs slowly came back from 545. to
455. before rallying to about 495.
The boards at least informed the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange of the negotia-
tions, which is more than most com-
panies apparently even think of doing.
For example, the first announcement
said they proposed “to enter into dis-
cussions to explore the possibilities of
reaching agreement as to some form of
association and mutual endeavor”.
This could mean anything from swap-
ping technical knowledge to making a
complete takeover bid, so shareholders
were rather in the dark as to the value
of their respective investments. But at
least they were given the chance to
protect themselves, in the best manner
they knew.
Another Factors’ Chapter
Another chapter was written in the
Factors - Stanhill story last week.
The receiver for Rockmans, Mr N. W.
Buckley, said the company’s debenture
holders would collect, on the average, no
less than £6O on each £lOO debenture.
Rockmans is a subsidiary of Factors, the
once finance company for the Stanhill
group, but now mainly only a share-
holder in Holeproof Industries of New
Zealand.
Back in August, 1961, Rockmans
started to finish up by selling its 70
stores to Woolworths for about £5 mil-

plant of some subsidiaries were also sold,
as well as a number of extra freehold
properties. The firm now consists basic-
ally of two wholly-owned subsidiaries—
Roger David and K. and E. Rogers—
for which Mr Buckley is currently call-
ing tenders.
Books closed on May 14 to deter-
mine those entitled to the first payout
of ss. 6d. in the £1 (£27 10s. a £100).
At the end of May last year it was
thought that only £46 a £lOO would be
collected in total. But this estimate is
now “not less than £6O”, due to the
successful sale of some £2 million in tax
losses which existed in the group.
The final estimate could be even
higher—this will depend on the net
gains, if any, resulting from the sale of
the remaining assets. Although the
Rockmans’ story is not expected to be
closed until 1965 or later, negotiations
for the disposal of these assets should
be finished by the end of this year. This
means that debenture holders could know
definitely what they are to receive be-
fore 1965. Even if they don’t know,
there is at least a strong possibility of
receiving a second payment before the
year runs out, according to Mr Buckley.
Bellambi’s Reasons
TJellambi Coal shareholders are
** advised by their directors to part
with at least half their holdings for
17s. 6d. cash per ss. unit to Consoli-
dated Gold Fields (Aust.) Pty, for the
sake of the greater financial and tech-
nical facilities which that company can
provide.
Over the next four years £1.9 million
will be required for additional mining
equipment, and the sinking of a new
ventilation shaft, in order to fulfil large
contracts with Japanese firms.
Mcllwraith McEacharn and Burns
Philp have already accepted the partial
bid for shares they hold in Bellambi.
Consolidated Gold already owns some
17.5 p.c. of Bellambi’s £559,088 paid
capital. It will accept all or part of the
remainder of any holding up to July 8.
Market price for the shares is cur-
rently about Is. below the cash offer.
Seven Lean Years
A loss of £30,000 or so in the half-
year to January 31 is the latest in
a series of losses by the operating sub-
sidiary of Sydney BMC distributor,
P. and R. Williams Holdings Ltd.
Used car trading is the bogy.
In the last year to October 31, it
looked as if Williams was nearly out
of the woods. The loss of £6829 was
the smallest of seven successive losses.
At the annual meeting in December,
the company was described as “profit-
able”.
The operating subsidiary, P. and R.
Williams Pty, has been in the hands of
a receiver and manager since April 28.
The ss. shares currently bring about
lOd. on the market.
Floating Aerosols
Tt was Amalgamated Chemicals which
first brought investors’ attention to
the nascent aerosol industry in Australia.
Now Avala Holdings Ltd, a die-
caster and itself a relatively late arrival
on the Stock Exchange, is proposing to
float off its newly-formed subsidiary
Consolidated Aerosols Pty as a public
company.
In June, 1963, it secured the Aus-
tralian franchise for the product “Spare
Tire”, manufactured by Consolidated
Aerosol Corporation of New York.
The American company did intend to
take a 49 p.c. interest in its manu-
facture here, but then decided to par-
ticipate on a royalty basis only.

solidated Aerosols in Australia could

explained.
Avala plans to retain a 25 to 40 p.c.
interest in the new company’s paid
capital of £IOO,OOO. Priority for the
remaining shares will be given to Avala
shareholders before the general public.
The diecasting division of Avala
experienced keen competition resulting
in reduced profit in the December half-
year. If the aerosol business has good
potential, surely it would be more

the group.
Prestige-Holeproof First Result
A ll appears well for Prestige Ltd, the
Melbourne-based hosiery and tex-
tile group which bought Holeproof In-
dustries’ ordinary capital from Factors
for a net £2.6 million in April. The
consolidated profit rose from last year's
record £312,786, before the acquisition,
to £567,660 in the latest year to March
31.
How much of the increase is attribu-
table to Holeproof is difficult to ascer-
tain. The only accounts available tabu-
late its results for the 1963 year to
December 31. They have been ad-
justed to cover the 12 months to March
31 for the purposes of calculating the
group result and because of a recent
amendment to the Companies Act which
provides that a subsidiary’s ruling-off
must be made at the same time as that
of the holding company.
Holeproof's accounts to December 31
showed a profit of £312,672 compared
with £283,309 in the previous year and
equalled 20.6 p.c. on ordinary capital
after deducting £23,290 for preference
dividends. On this basis, Prestige’s £2.6
million layout is producing a very
healthy 11 p.c. return. But from this
must be deducted the cost of the money
borrowed to buy Holeproof in the first
place.
The consolidated result is equal to an
earning rate of 31.5 p.c. on capital,
which was lifted to £1.6 million by a
three-for-five share issue a few months
ago to help raise over £1 million of the
purchase price. The new shares rank
for dividends in the current year. Divi-
dend requirement on these and the old
shares (presuming the maintenance of a
124 p.c. payout) will be around £260,000
(including the preference charge), so the
past year’s £567,660 profit, if main-
tained, will provide an ample cover.
This cover has every chance of being
wider, however, in the current year.
Sales for April and May have risen,
according to the chairman, Mr G. G.
Foletta. Moreover, it is possible that
Holeproof's contribution will be greater,
depending on what method the Prestige
directors used to adjust its profit in the
year to December 31 to cover the 12
months to March 31.
Hard Lines for Thiess
Tt seems unfortunate that Thiess Hold-
ings Ltd has had to sell 300,000
of its 740,000 20s. shares in Thiess-
Peabody-Mitsui Coal Pty to improve
liquidity.
Although the sale was at a premium,
greater benefits would have been forth-
coming a few years hence. The com-
pany retains about 20 p.c. of the capital
in the coal venture'.
Difficulties with two group contracts
(one for the Snowy Mountains Author-
ity) resulted in a loss for the half-year
to December 31, the first setback the
company has had in its public history.
Directors said at the time they believed
the reverse was only temporary.
Thiess has also raised £500,000 for
10 years at 51 p.c. interest, from over-
seas sources, so that in all the company
has almost £1 million more in liquid
funds to tide it over.
Although the company has been in
the habit of paying 124 p.c. dividends,
as the interim was omitted it seems un-
likely that reserves will be tapped at
the end of the year to keep faith with
shareholders.
Present price of around 7s. 9d. there-
fore looks unduly optimistic for short-
term prospects.
Tactical Diversification
HThe diversification of British Tobacco
proved its success in the half-year
to April 30, when trading profits in-
creased satisfactorily despite the initial
adverse effect the American Surgeon-
General's report on smoking and health
had on cigarette sales. The company’s
best-known brands are Craven A Filter
and Country Life.
As cigarette sales are now displaying
a recovery trend toward the pre-report
level, and the returns from non-cigarette
activities are increasing, the company’s
full results for the year to October 31
should show a continuance of the in-
creases which have been scored in the
last two years. In 1962-63, profits were
£2,473,306, equalling 12.6 p.c. on capi-
tal, from which a 10 p.c. dividend was
distributed. Interim in the current year
was 5 p.c.
Apart from cigarette manufacture, the
company has moved into printing and
packaging, manufacture and mainten-
ance of indoor bowling machinery,
manufacture of baking equipment and
pastoral holdings. It now has 31 sub-
sidiaries. The printing and packaging
activities were mainly responsible for the
increased trading profit earned during
the half-year to April 30.

diversification moves were made into
this field. In the last week of April, it
was announced that a 32.7 p.c. interest
had been bought in Dodge Consolidated
Industries, packaging group. Moreover,
this move will finance the Dodge take-
over of a leading private Sydney fibre-
container business —Cartons and Corru-
gated Papers and its subsidiary National
Paper Mills.
If the day comes when smoking is
considered largely as an unhealthy relic
from the past, British Tobacco will feel
the blow to a much lesser degree than
any of its competitors because of this
extensive diversification.
Weathering the Storm
\. and I. Discounters Ltd seems to
be weathering the storm in which
many of the smaller financiers have
nearly foundered. The chairman, Sir
Arthur Warner, assured shareholders
last week that profits, in the year to
June 30, would cover the 8 p.c. dividend
forecast in the prospectus for the com-
pany’s first full financial year. Trading
started in August of 1962 and a dis-
tribution of 7i p.c. was made for the
first 11 months to June 30 last.
One of the secrets of the company’s
success is undoubtedly the fact that it
has avoided any factoring business.
Moreover, its sponsors, Electronic In-
dustries and Australian and International
Insurances, help no end. Financing
Electronic’s hire purchase contracts
creates an assured volume of business.
The success of a recent £IOO,OOO un-
secured note issue, which carried interest
rates of 8 to 10 p.c., endorses the regard
which investors have for the fact that
activities are complementary to both of
the sponsors. Many new companies
have difficulty in raising fixed interest
finance —this issue was A. and I.’s second
since listing.
Mysterious Hoppers
Ta/|YSTERious messages have been passed
to shareholders of PPW Holdings
Ltd that a cash offer of Bs. 6d. will be
made for each 2s. 6d. share.
The company handles coal hopper
waggons on the northern and southern
coalfields of NSW, and could thus be
attractive to any collier or transporter.
The identity of the bidder was not dis-
closed immediately.
PPW has a paid capital of only
£49,473 since return of half its capital
in March, after realising one of its major
investments.
The quotes of 7s. buyer and 10s.
seller, after announcement of the price
offered, showed the two winds in which
the market held the stock.

Awaiting a WMC Issue
P|nly rarely do a company’s shares rise after it has an-
nounced a lower profit, but Western Mining Corporation
has managed to perform this feat. The main reason for the
rise is that investors are expecting the announcement of a
share issue to be made any day now.
At last September's annual meeting the chairman, Mr G.
Lindesay Clark, said a new share issue would probably be
made in the near future. Cash was needed to pay the re-
maining calls on the corporation's Alcoa shares and for iron
ore development and investigational activities. Many share-
holders expected the “near future” to be when the annual
results were released but, as things turned out, they are still
waiting.
Western Mining is the largest local partner in the Alcoa
aluminium project. At present, its main incomes are from
gold producers Central Norseman, a partly owned subsidiary,
and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, in which a large share interest
is held. Great Western Consolidated is a third member of
the group but it ceased operations in May last year following
the recording of heavy losses.
The consolidated result eased from £370,000 to £342,000
in round figures, as a result of lower income from the gold
interests. The parent company, which is mainly involved with
iron ore, lifted profit from £278,000 to £310,000
The basic reason for the overall profit drift was the setback
in Central Norseman’s profit from £640,000 to £586,000.
This company treated as much ore as last year but the grade
was lower, resulting in a decline in output from 104,000 ozs
to 98,000 ozs. The yearly dividend, however, was 6d. above
last year at 4s. This year’s interim of 2s. indicates a conti-
nuance of this in the current period.
GMK earned a steady profit of around £222,000 but this
was on higher capital. Nevertheless dividend was steady at Is.
The future looks a little brighter, although this year’s interim
has been cut from 6d. to 3d., as the Mt Charlotte lease should
be producing 20,000 tons of ore by the end of August and
26,000 tons by the end of the year. Milling at the new treat-
ment plant has not run at full capacity to date because of
delays in the Mt Charlotte development.
One can foresee a sharp drop in WMC shares if the share
issue does not come about soon. Although long-term pros-
pects are good, with the Alcoa project and an eight-year iron
ore contract with Japan, the short or immediate term is not
particularly rosy. With gold returns apparently declining and
the long wait before the substantial benefits from Alcoa and
Japan roll in, the expectance of a share issue is the only thing
which can hold the shares at present levels.
Brisbane Sugar Share Index
A new aid to investors is the introduction of a sugar share
index by the Brisbane Stock Exchange.
It will measure the daily percentage change in the total
monetary value of the sugar company share list—with one
notable exception, the giant Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd.
Stocks in the index are Fairymead. Gibson and Howes,
Haughton, Maryborough, Millaquin, Moreton Central, Pioneer
and Plane Creek. These eight companies now have a market
valuation of over £29 million.
They are outweighed by more than three-to-one by CSR's
market valuation which would, if included in the index, com-
pletely dominate it and conceal day-to-day fluctuations of the
other stocks.
CSR's share of the Australian mill production this year was
about 45 p.c. In addition, it produces about as much again
in Fiji.
Its diverse interests—in building materials and chemicals—•
are another convenient reason for exclusion.
Using the first half of 1959 as a base 100, the Brisbane
Stock Exchange has calculated an index level of 248.34 for
April 30, 1964. A peak of 251.51 was reached on April 20.
Chemical Plant at Kurnell?
savings in Australia’s import bill could be in the
A wind if the current speculation over the possibility of
ICIANZ building a chemical plant on the Kurnell peninsula
(NSW) proves to be true. Initially, the project, which could
cost £6 million, will produce high-density polythene.
Australia’s demands for this product are met entirely by
imports at present. In 1962-63, 4842 tons came in, almost
half being from Germany, but in the mere three months to
September last, 3286 tons landed on Australian wharves. If
ICIANZ does build, it will almost certainly share some costs
with Farbwerke Hoechst AG, one of Germany’s largest
chemical groups.
Hoechst announced a year ago that it was planning to set
up a petrochemical operation in Australia in conjunction with
a local group. High-density polythene production would be
about 10,000 tons a year it said at the time —it has been
estimated that our market potential is between 15,000 and
16,000 tons.
ICIANZ is examined by “Security” on page 70.

Email May Be Poised For Expansion
Prospect of higher earnings after reorganisation
By ROGER RANDERSON
Tt had seemed until recently that Email
A Limited might have shot its bolt
when it gave shareholders bonus issues
of one-for-four in June, 1955, and of
one-for-one in December, 1956, fol-
lowing many years when 12} p.c. divi-
dends were paid and shares were allotted
at high premiums to acquire numerous
businesses.
This company, however, should never
be underestimated, and there are reasons
for thinking that earnings are likely to
show considerable improvement after
having reached bedrock in recent years.
Although the policy of spreading
activities over a surprisingly large num-
ber of fields and products is still being
pursued, long-continued consolidation
and, more recently, substantial reorgani-
sation should have brought much im-
provement in operating efficiency.
Signs of vigorous expansion have yet
to be seen to compensate for the im-
pression that published results give of
sluggish earnings.
Nevertheless, Email, with its capital
unchanged at £5,585,831 for seven and
a half years, has been steadily adding
to its provisions and reserves, so that
the balance sheet now reveals a position
of quite considerable strength. This
should please stockholders, who number
more than 14,000.
The company, with three knights on
the board since Sir Warren McDonald
of the Commonwealth Banking Cor-
poration recently cemented previous
relations by taking a seat beside Sir
Lionel Hooke, of AWA, and the
übiquitous Sir lan Potter, has all the
advantages of influential connections.
Email employs more than 6000 people
in its modern factories at Waterloo and
Auburn (Sydney), Nottinghill (Mel-
bourne) and Orange (NSW). The range
of its electrical products, tools and other
industrial equipment falls into more than
100 groups, meeting many household
requirements, besides those of other in-
dustries and of building constructions.
Will the company soon begin to show
greater earning capacity, maintain its
10 p.c. dividend with a wider margin,
and break the long drought by offering
additional benefits to its shareholders?
There is nothing in the 1963 published
accounts, following two similarly difficult
years, to encourage this hope.
However, putting two and two to-
gether from the chairman's statements at
the annual meeting last month and what
is known about the state of business
generally, Email may reasonably be ex-
pected to make a better showing in the
f Llture -
The chief reason why investors have
been chary about the shares as an invest-
ment is that they have doubted the com-
pany s ability to sustain its 10 p.c. divi-
enc * -
Published results have shown a poor
‘•dividend cover”, or surplus of earnings
after payments of dividends, in recent
y
I feel, however, that the present price
of about Bs. Bd. for the ordinary ss.
stock unit fully discounts any remain-
ing risk of a temporary reduction in the
dividend, and allows nothing for im-
proved prospects of a well-established
company which has considerable
potentialities,
Certainly, a return of about 5.8 p.c.
on money outlaid to buy the shares at
current prices must, in present circum-
stances, be deemed attractive.
Mr E. G. F. Horne informed his
shareholders at last month’s annual
meeting that the 1963 results cloaked a
marked improvement that had occurred
in the final quarter of last year, and
that in the first quarter of the current

year sales, profit and outstanding orders
were higher than they had been a year
before.
Although he qualified this to some
extent by referring to areas where in-
tense competition still left unsatisfactory
profit margins, his assurances took the
edge off the poor published results for
1963.
Email gave its profit as £711,274 for
the year ended December 31, but only
after bringing to account a net surplus
from the sale of fixed assets and invest-
ments of £101,588.
Adjusted profit of £609,686 fell by
25 p.c. from the 1962 amount of
£815,330.
It is true that there had been non-
recurring items amounting to £189,887
in 1962 arising from a change in
accounting dates and receipt of a special
dividend from Commonwealth Ceramics
on becoming an associated company.
Discarding this amount, however, profit
was still down by £15,757 compared
with what the chairman had previously
described as a “difficult year.”
Depreciation charged for 1963
amounted to £401,954, which was
£18,532 less than in the previous year,
while the amount of £281,000 provided
for income tax showed a reduction also,
of £52,846.
Income tax provisions may be decep-
tive, as pointed out, because dividends
from associated companies are virtually
free of tax and a large part of earnings
needed for marked expansion of asso-
ciated companies, such as Coramic Aus-
tralia Pty Ltd is not brought into the
consolidated accounts.
Nevertheless, the company gave the
impression of scraping the barrel to
maintain the 10 p.c. ordinary dividend
rate, when its adjusted profit showed a
surplus of only £55,103 after meeting
dividend payments on preference and
ordinary capital totalling £554,583.
Email’s profit history since 1954
(when about 31 p.c. was earned on end-
year capital of £1,870,364) has not been
inspiring, but at least the dividend has
been fairly high and relatively stable.

We all know about the fluctuating
market for consumer durables, which
partly accounts for this stagnant profit
record.
It would be interesting to know also
whether, and to what extent, it is the
legacy of some ill-conceived or ill-
digested “take-overs”. Diversification,
we should by now have learned, can be
had at too high a price.
However, all this is past history.
Unlike many others, I do not attempt
to project these past results into the
future, believing that there are more
significant factors than arithmetic to be
considered.
Re-arrangement of balance sheet
figures in the table on the previous page
helps to indicate the company’s financial
strength and liquid position, which not
only offer an assurance of stability but
also the mobile availability of funds for
its operations.
For example, provisions for deprecia-
tion and reserves for increased cost of
plant replacement together aggregate
£7,125,611 against the cost and valua-
tion of all fixed assets at £9,538,600.
Working capital, including £600,000
of short-term deposits at balancing date,
is ample, and there are no appreciable
long-term liabilities.
Stock exchange investments had a
market value at balancing date of
£2,129,224 —more than double their cost
as shown in the books.
Shares in associated and other com-
panies appear at cost and valuation of
£1,063,227.
A significant reduction of £1,128,398
in stocks and unrecouped expenditure on
contracts during 1963 was just about
matched by rises in debtors and amounts
due under hire purchase contracts.
The company's interim report for the
six months ended June 30 is keenly
awaited, and I shall be very surprised
if it does not confirm the expectation
that Email is moving on to better results
in the future.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
ICIANZ Esteemed in the Markets
Really for long-term investors at current prices
■fl/HEN I last wrote about Imperial
Chemical Industries of Australia
and New Zealand Ltd, in December,
1961, the shares were at their most
depressed point for many years. There
had been considerable speculation as to
the competition which ICIANZ would
face both from local and overseas pro-
ducts. As a result, at one stage the
shares fell to 355. 9d., at which price
they were showing a dividend yield of
nearly 4 p.c.—almost unheard of for
this company. At that time I wrote,
“Despite current fears, ICIANZ is still
very sound and the acquisition of rights
under 10s. or old shares ex rights under
40s. will be a good long-term invest-
ment”.
Another prediction borne out was the
rate of return on group sales. It was
suggested that in 1961 the percentage of
“operating” income to group sales could
fall to about 12 p.c. In effect, as the
following table shows, this figure was
11.9 p.c. and also it is interesting to see
that the percentage has risen fairly
rapidly over the last two years.

With a view to making some estimate
about the future, it was asumed that by
1963 the total capital employed would
be about £76 million. In fact, the total
capital employed at the end of the 1963
year reached £80.5 million. It was also
suggested conservatively that the return
on these funds would be at the rate of
about 16 p.c. Unfortunately, as the fol-
lowing table shows, this has not been
realised and in the last year this return
has fallen to 13.6 p.c.

A glance at this row of figures also
indicates that there would seem to be
a persistent downward trend. However,
this may not necessarily affect the con-
clusion about earnings since the company
has recently announced its intention to
raise £6 million by an issue of unsecured
notes. The most significant factor, per-
haps, to investors generally was the low
interest rate at which these notes were
to be offered. If the company is able
to continue its expansion, which would
appear to be going on at the rate of
£lO million per annum, with the use of
more fixed-interest money at cheap rates,
then it is not completely out of the ques-
tion that the earning rate on ordinary
capital will be of the order of 15 p.c.
by the time 1965 is reached.
Nevertheless, the apparent decline in
profitability on total capital may sooner
or later cause a reaction, so far as the
earning rate on ordinary capital is con-
cerned.
The rate of dividend increase cer-
tainly seems to be proceeding at a rather
slower rate than I would have expected
in 1961. In fact, the dividend has only
been increased fractionally since the
issue. While we have yet to see the
policy so far as the 1964 year is con-
cerned, it is doubtful whether the com-
pany will increase the dividend rate
much further before 1965.
TVespite this rather unsatisfactory pre-
diction of the future of earnings and
dividends, the share price has been rising
very strongly since the beginning of the
1963 calendar year. Early in the year
the price was 455. It continued between
this level and 475. until about the middle
of the year, when it started a prolonged
rise which took it up to nearly 545.
After a slight reaction to 495., it then
recovered most dramatically and rose
to very nearly 60s. in the early part of
the current calendar year. However,
since then it has tended to drift down-
wards and fell from 555. 6d. down to
535. 6d. on the announcement of the
note issue. The yield at the current price
of 525. 6d. is 2.7 p.c. and the dividend
would appear to be covered about 14
times, suggesting that the earnings yield
is just about 4 p.c.
This seems to indicate that the mar-
ket is still expecting rather great things
of ICIANZ. One would have the im-
pression that these are unlikely to be
realised, at least in the short term
While it must be admitted that the
recovery in earnings over the last three
years has been quite dramatic, it can-
not be overlooked that there was a most
substantial fall in earnings in 1961. The
following figures are an index of divi-
dends and earnings per share, going back
to 1955. From this it would appear as
though there has been only a very small
growth in per share earnings over this
last period, mainly because after rising
to a peak in 1958 earnings have since
receded. Dividends per share, on the
other hand, show a fairly modest in-
crease, which is equivalent to about 4.2
p.c. on average at an annual compound
rate over this period.
Year to Per Share
September 30 Pividends Earnings
1955 1«0 100
1956 100 101
1957 116 121
1958 116 123

1960 128 120
1961 133 84
1962 136 108
1963 . 139 108
Even if this rate of increase (4.2 p.c.)
continues for ever, the effective return
will only amount to about 7 p.c. on
the current price. Unless one is an in-
stitutional investor who is taxed on
interest but not taxed on dividend in-
come, it is difficult to see how such a
return can be attractive when one can
obtain 64 p.c. for the next 20 years with
absolute certainty from a fixed-interest
issue by the same company.
For those who are not interested in
dividend income but seek to make capi-
tal profits, it is as well to point out the
following. If the dividend increases over
the next five years at the same rate as it
has done in the last nine years, the divi-
dend rate in 1969 would be Is. 9d. per
share. If the stock is being priced to
show a 24 p.c. yield the price would
then be 70s. This would represent an
average return of 54 p.c. per annum
on the present price. If the price then
is based on a 3 p.c. dividend yield it
would be 58s. 4d. only and this would
represent a return of 1! p.c. per annum.
In both cases, of course, the total return
would be supplemented by an average
dividend return of about 3 p.c.
The foregoing is only an attempt to
show with figures that ICIANZ shares
are for the long-term institutional inves-
tor at current prices.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Jewellers Fail to Sparkle
Angus and Coote merger disappoints
fFHE merger of two Sydney jewellers,
-*■ Saunders Ltd with Angus & Coote
(Holdings) Ltd, has failed to produce
any of the substantial benefits which
were expected for the future.
Profits for the last four years to June,
1963, have shown a decline of almost
one-third on the combined earnings of
the two companies prior to the merger
in June, 1960. Moreover, two other
businesses were acquired in 1960, which
should have assisted the later results.
Two firms selling luxury goods were
bound to be hard hit by the recession.
There seems to be little sign of recovery
since.
Angus & Coote became listed on
Sydney Stock Exchange after a place-
ment late in 1952. The jewellery and
watch-making business had been estab-
lished in 1895.
It has a mart-order business, distributes
hearing-aids, makes capital equipment,
electroplate ware, does badge-stamping
and enamelling.
A few months prior to the Saunders
take-over the company made a one-for-
four par issue. This has been the only
capital “benefit” to shareholders.
Saunders had been operating as jewel-
ler, silversmith, watchmaker and opti-
cian since 1878. By 1960 it had two
city stores, two in the suburbs and one
in Wollongong.
Unfortunately Saunders shares were
selling higher than Angus & Coote
shares at the time. Unlike most take-
overs, therefore, the share premium of
the bidding company could not be used
to great effect. The basis of the ex-
change was 11 Angus & Coote ss. shares
for each 10 held in Saunders.
Angus & Coote capital was increased
by £484,000 as a result of the merger.
In June, 1960, the company acquired
Hansens Pty Ltd, jeweller and watch-
maker of Orange. Perfection Plate Pty,
silverware manufacturer, was taken over
in December, 1960.
Thus, in two years, paid capital of
Angus and Coote was enlarged from
£380,000 to £1 million (June 30, 1961),
at which level it stands today.
In 1961-62 all manufacturing opera-
tions were consolidated in new premises
at Revesby. This move entailed certain
non-recurring expenditure. The Pitt
Street and Hurstville stores were
modernised. In 1962-63 additional
stores were opened at Canberra and
Warringah Mall, Brookvale.
Profits fell off so severely in 1961 that
dividend was cut from 10 p.c. (the rate
ruling for the previous six years) to 6
p.c. Earnings since then have not war-
ranted any upward revision of the divi-
dend.
The interim report for six months to
April 30 said that turnover and profits
showed an increase over the correspond-
ing period of the previous year. The
6 p.c. dividend was maintained by a
3 p.c. interim.
Investors can deduce from this that
there was no remarkable increase in
net earnings. Directors had predicted
a record turnover this year with the
assistance of new stores. They appear
to be looking to suburban and country
stores for most improvement.
However, if the higher sales are not
translated into higher profits, there is
little comfort for shareholders.
The ss. shares are hanging pre-
cariously on par level. Unless there is
some marked trading recovery in the
second half of this year to October, they
will not hold that level.
GEO. PIZZEY AND SON LTD
Benefits to Sustain Interest?
leather industry has been hard hit
A by the introduction of synthetic
materials, so that any leather merchant
must be scrutinised carefully before in-
vestment.
The business of Geo. Pizzey and Son
Ltd originated in the 1880 s, but did not
go public until 1920. Since 1928 profits
have been earned each year, although
dividends were omitted for six depression
years. Since 1947 dividends have been
at least 10 p.c.
In the latest year to June 30, Geo.
Pizzey increased earnings from £102,499
to £142,208, after providing £22,613
more for tax at £78,515, but £6152 less
for depreciation at £59,740.
Geo. Pizzey combats the threat of
synthetics by keeping plant and buildings
modern and efficient, by diversifying
(yes, and into synthetics), by keeping
abreast of the latest tanning techniques,
developments and plant, and overseas
customers’ requirements. A reserve of
£12,000 for export and technical de-
velopment has been created for this
purpose.
The chairman (Mr C. E. Pizzey)
pointed out in his annual review that
the tanning trade is closely allied to
primary industry, because of its large
usage of hides and skins.
“Rising costs make exports more
difficult. Any reduction of tariff duties
on imported leathers could seriously
affect production and the economy of
the industry,” the chairman said.
A warehouse at Fitzroy supplies re-
quirements to the footwear industries,
and to sporting, fishing, hobby and toy
retailers. The parent also makes com-
ponents for the shoe and allied trades.
Investments of the parent were in-
creased from £149,841 to £214,383, by
purchase on the stock exchange and
by exchange of 70,588 shares in
Moulded Products Ltd (plus £50,000
cash) for part of the plant of Drape-
molders Pty. Market value at June 30,
1963, of listed investments exceeded
book value by £81,904.
Capital increased by £16,271 during
1962-63 by the purchase of Fred Glover

Pty, and a further £4OOO in ordinary
shares will be issued at a later date.
Directors were so confident of the
company’s earning capacity that they
raised dividend in 1962-63 from 10 to
12 p.c. (Earning rate had soared from
14.8 to 21.0 p.c.)
The market’s estimation of the stock
has altered accordingly, and the ss.
shares, which were obtainable for Bs. 9d.
early last year, now fetch 13s. 9d. The
yield at that point is 4.4 p.c.
In 1959-60 freehold properties were
revalued, and revaluation reserve in-
creased thereby from £96,480 to
£801,934.
Perhaps the market senses the
imminence of a bonus. That revalua-
tion reserve would be ample to cover a
one-for-one bonus, as made in June,
1951. (Paid ordinary capital is now
£654,423.)
The position of leather in industry
today, however, is very different from
that of 12 years ago, and the company
is unlikely to strain its resources to that
extent. Smaller, more frequent capital
benefits would sustain interest in this
stock.
DULY AND HANSFORD LTD
Income Only
Just Now
Tf the 18 p.c. increase in sales for the
A first half of the current year to
June continues for the rest of the year
and brings a similar increase in profit,
shareholders of Duly and Hansford Ltd
may expect a return to pre-recession
profit levels.
The two years to June, 1961 and
1962 brought sharp profit falls. But
last year saw a fair recovery to the
point where Duly and Hansford was
paying out no more than it earned.
As a manufacturer of a wide range
of automotive equipment for original
use and for replacement, and of hand
tools and bright steel bolts and nuts
under the Dufor brand name, this com-
pany's prosperity is closely tied to the
motor industry.
The motor vehicle industry had a
much more stable year in 1962-63 than
in the two preceding ones. This motor
sales increase was also reflected in the
general engineering business.
Prices are still very competitive and
margins small, directors reported in
November last year. Higher wage costs
forced an increase in the company’s
selling prices.
Profit rose from £124,504 to
£165,118 after providing £112.000
(1962, £84,000) for tax and £100,655
(£106,051) for depreciation.

Which bus is the one Ella said to take?
An area the size of Mackellar County demands a complex pattern of Public Trans-
port. One hundred and seventy-nine buses on forty four different routes serve the
County’s needs. These bus services reach out through the 70 miles of fast modern
main roads, winding off along the four hundred and seventy miles of suburban
roads connecting industrial, residential and shopping areas. This is the transport
service that will carry your workforce to your new Mackellar County plant. Roads
and buses...people and land...water and electricity...all vital factors deciding the
choice of your new plant location. Mackellar County is one of the fastest develop-
ing areas in Australia. Have you had a good look at Mackellar yet?
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.
For complete details, write in confidence to the Chairman,
Mackellar County Council, 48 Sydney Road, Manly, New
South Wales.

MACKELLAR COUNTY
NEW SOUTH WALES
ening plant was established the first
in Australia which allows use of a
cheaper and lower grade of steel for
automotive rear axle shafts. Another
unit will be installed in 1964.
Duly and Hansford’s directors con-
sider their manufacturing facilities for
rear axle shafts and engine valves the
most highly developed in Australia and
equal to most overseas installations.
Products are distributed through
automotive wholesalers and engineering
houses throughout Australia. They are
exported to 19 countries.
The business originated as a partner-
ship in 1921, becoming incorporated in
1935. It attained public status in 1949.
There have been four par issues to
shareholders in recent years 1954,
1955, 1958, 1960 all in the ratio of
one-for-four.
Today the company has paid capital
of £1,644,242, and supporting reserves
of £754,322. There are no long-term
liabilities. The working capital position
appears comfortable, although in De-
cember last directors admitted they had
been considering raising capital from out-
side sources other than shareholders.
Shareholders can therefore take the
hint that the stock is, for the time being,
only of interest for income. At 395. 9d.
the 20s. shares yield 5 p.c. This looks
a pretty fair assessment.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
A Contest Between Portfolios
Interim remarks on Speculator v. "Financial Review ”
I" et’s get straight onto the comparison
between the “Financial Review”
portfolio and my own portfolio up to
the end of May.
In this comparison, Eve ignored the
dividends received in the last six months.
Also I’ve not worried too much about
the odd pounds. Nevertheless, the final
answer, I feel, is fairly close to the
mark.
First of all, let me deal with the
opposition. A reasonable appreciation
equal to 17.5 p.c. per annum, but hardly
spectacular with no profit exceeding
£lOO. Kelvinator, adjusted for the
bonus, was the star, yet only 200 shares
were in the portfolio. Max Wurcker
also worked out very well, thanks to Mr
Nash. Other things to be observed are
that the heavy stocks, in particular BHP,
ACI and Myers, pulled down the overall
performance. As for the old Peters Vic-
toria, the best thing it could do was to
change its name.

Concerning my own portfolio, I was
either very right or very wrong. In the
last two w'eeks Gibson & Howes have
plummeted down from 70s. to 595.,
turning a £lOO profit into a £l2O loss.
Aeron was not too far behind with a
loss of £BO. But the profits more than
made it up. Tableland Tin, with a profit
of £2BO, and W.J. Manufacturing, show-
ing a £2OO increase, were the largest.
All in all, an appreciation at a yearly
rate of 25 p.c. was recorded.
If there is to be any conclusion, it is
that one should look beyond buying the
leaders and not have too many stocks.
The whole background to my port-
folio is change. Out of the 19 stocks
at November, only four remain. In
many cases I have sold too early.
Paynter & Dixon and ISAS (NSW) are
examples of that. On the other hand,
I have sold several stocks at prices con-
siderably higher than the present. The
most striking example is Gibson &
Howes, which I sold at 755. back in
February. If I had done nothing else
to the portfolio but this one transaction,
the annual rate of appreciation would
have jumped to 30 p.c. Then, how-
ever, I would have had nothing to fill
the column.
What about my own performance
over the last six months? Strangely
enough, it also has shown an apprecia-
tion of about £1250, the value of the
present portfolio being just on £11,200.
As far as the past is concerned, all
my buying and selling has been in vain
except for the fact that the portfolio now
looks in pretty good shape. Hanimex,
my oldest and largest holding, has been
quite static in the period under review.
The next few months will be the test.
Backing up Hanimex, there are a
number of companies such as Tableland
Tin, Chemical Materials, Conquip, Eric
White and Malleys which should turn in
booming results in this financial year.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 CSR, 83/- £Bl9
BOUGHT
2000 Pioneer Concrete rts, 2/7 £267
800 Conkeys, 16/3 £664
So the business this week was a case
of reducing the sugar interests and in-
creasing the meat side. I also thought
it best to cover the Pioneer Concrete
rights. After this, I’m left with £ll2
in the account.
The portfolio now is:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Irrigation Farmers’ Wrath Flares
Research report held to be misleading
Trrigation farmers in the Riverina are
hot under the collar over a report
written for the Australian Development
and Research Foundation in Sydney.
The energetic and outspoken secre-
tary of the Irrigation Research and Ex-
tension Committee of the Murrumbidgee
and Coleambally irrigation areas, Mr A.
J. Grassby, says the report will mislead
“parliamentarians, administrators and
research people” in their attitudes to-
wards irrigation.
Mr Grassby and his committee have
dug up some interesting facts about this
report which have yet to be denied
by the Australian Development and Re-
search Foundation.
Not the least interesting is the charge
that it cost £48,000 to prepare. A
Dr J. B. Condliffe, an economist at
Stanford University, USA, and two
colleagues were paid this amount to
come to Australia and do the job which,
in any man's language, is not bad going.
They spent four months in all in Aus-
tralia and, according to Mr Grassby,
did not even bother to inspect the Mur-
rumbidgee and Coleambally areas.
Nevertheless, they reported in some-
what scathing terms on irrigation in
general.
Their treatment was inadequate, un-
balanced and calculated to lead to error
in assessing the importance of irrigation
development now and in the future,
according to Mr Grassby.
What did the men from Stanford
say?
They said in their report that the costs
of establishing a farm in the Coleambally
region would be between £40,000 and
£50,000. The IREC version is about
£30,000.
They said that dairying would be a
major industry. The IREC reply is that
dairying has not been projected at all
up to this time on Coleambally.
They said that fruitgrowing would be
a major industry and that fruitgrowing
was already heavily subsidised by the
Government. The IREC view is that
fruitgrowing is not a subsidised industry.
Their conclusion was that this project
was “an expensive mode of employing
additional population and of extending
settlement”.
They went further and said that “it
may be thlit the best thing to do with
some of the Snowy water is to let it run
inexpensively away to the sea”.
Mr Grassby, in his turn, is scathing
about the mere one and a half pages in
the report devoted to the entire Murray-
Murrumbidgee irrigation picture, com-
pared with some 40 pages (in a total of
400) to the Ord River in WA.
As the Murray-Murrumbidgee ac-
counts for 90 per cent of Australia’s
irrigation and the Ord, even in circles
very close to irrigation, is regarded as
a bit of a gamble, Mr Grassby appears
to have a legitimate complaint.
He contends that the real facts on
irrigation would show that total pro-
duction runs at £129 millions a year.
This is one quarter of gross agricultural
production and one - eighth of total
pastoral and agricultural production.
The high return comes from about
two million acres, or 0.1 per cent, of the
land surface of Australia. It is a re-
turn of more than 100 per cent annually
on a total Government expenditure since
Federation of £l2O million.
Mr Grassby and his colleagues are
currently assessing irrigation figures in
more precise terms and hope to show
that the total contribution to the Gross
National Product by irrigation industries
is over £5OO million a year.
It seems clear that irrigation farmers
are going to need statistics of this kind
in the growing conflict over how Aus-
tralia's not unlimited water resources
should be utilised.
Much information on water resources
is being aired at various symposiums
arranged by such bodies as the Water
Research Foundation.
One does not necessarily disagree with
some of the facts stated at these sym-
posiums, but two general observations
can be made about them:
• The irrigation farmer does not get
much of a go and is usually presented
as a lazy or inefficient fellow wasting
enormous quantities of water.
• Industry—and the metropolises—
are going to need more and more water.
While the farmer may certainly in
some cases be wasteful, the symposiums
rarely hear any discussion on the waste-
fulness, perhaps, of certain tariff-pro-

tected industries; or of the amount of
water that goes on to gardens in Sydney
and in Melbourne (about one-third of
Melbourne’s total water consumption is
used on gardens).
The Water Research Foundation has
admirable motives which, simply stated,
are that we must all see to it that what
water we have is utilised in the best
possible way.
Obviously an irrigation farmer and
an industrialist will have differing views
on what is the best possible way.
The Water Research Foundation was
formed some eight years ago and now
has branches in all States. It gets
financial support from most State
Governments and from industry gener-
ally.
Specifically, some of its strongest sup-
port comes from industries which use
great quantities of water . . . synthetics,
petroleum, petrochemicals, paper, plas-
tics, detergents.
Symposiums are a development which
require some analysis themselves.
Everybody is on their best behavior.
Speakers, university professors in par-
ticular, take great pains to show that
they are most impartial and intelligent
fellows, able to see all points of view.
Occasionally a rebel will come up with
outrageous statements, which, too, are
part of the game. When this happens,
the assembled academics realise that he
is speaking for the benefit of the Press
and will even give him assistance.
This they do by tongue-in-cheek ques-
tions. Privately they will insist that the
Press took him “out of context”.
In this kind of heady intellectual
atmosphere, the rare representative of a
farmers’ organisation who dares to get
on his feet emerges as a tongue-tied
bumpkin.
Young graduates in private firms or
State departments will laugh heartily at
the clever quips of a university don.
When a farmer tries to infuse some
humor into the goings on, the response
is aloof restraint.
These things need to be said . . .
generalisations as they are.
Farmers need a much stronger voice
at these gatherings and it needs to be a
well-equipped voice.
They might very well enlist the aid of
historians, who could help put the views
of the engineers and geologists (strongly
represented in the Water Research
Foundation) into perspective.
For instance, on the subject of irri-
gation water waste,, the question might
well be asked —is it waste?
It has been determined fairly accu-
rately that about half of the water used
in irrigation is lost by evaporation and
seepage. But no-one has determined
accurately the change that has been
brought about in lands adjoining the
irrigation areas.
Before irrigation in the Goulburn Val-
ley of Victoria, it was common for there
to be no rain at all during the summer
months. Meteorologists admit that re-
cords do not go back far enough for
definite conclusions to be made, but their
view appears to be that those drought
years in the 1860 s and ’7os were part of
a drought cycle.
Perhaps it was not a cycle at all.
Perhaps the presence of water in irriga-
tion channels, the growth of crops on
irrigation, the seepage of water to ad-
joining non-irrigated areas, and the
evaporation into the atmosphere of mois-
ture have altered the rainfall frequency
of the area.
At least research into this aspect
appears worthwhile.
Let no one accuse Man on the Land
of running down the work the scientists
and engineers are doing.
Often under severe financial handi-
caps, they are putting their minds to
matters of vital national interest. A few
which come to mind are: analysis of
streamflow, lowering of salinity, the
development of film to reduce evapora-
tion, the design of more effective irri-
gation channels and pipes.
It is simply that the farmer is being
left out. Instead of the farmer and his
family being regarded as human beings
they are increasingly, in the academic
sense, being relegated to mere statistics.
This imbalance in water resources
discussion was highlighted at a recent
State symposium of the Water Research
Foundation at Melbourne University.
The speakers were a meteorologist,
a CSIRO physicist, a geologist, an agri-
cultural scientist specialising in soil con-
servation, a water supply engineer, a
professor of civil engineering, a design
engineer, and a civil engineer attached
to a large industrial concern.
No one, least of all Man on the Land,
could accuse any of these gifted and
extremely well-qualified speakers of
distorting facts.
Nevertheless, the overall picture was
very much in favor of industry and the
metropolises having priority in future
use of water.
A practical farmer, or a man such
as Mr Grassby for instance, would have

provided the balance that was lacking.
The civil engineer attached to Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, Mr G.
Moffat, made a very good point in his
talk when he suggested that what was
needed urgently was a “flexible, State-
wide, water resources plan”.
Farmers would be the first to agree.
Mr Moffat spoke of a very interesting
development in the multiple use of water
: —perhaps the key to making Australia's
water resources stretch much further.
Already there were two factories in
Victoria which used the water for their
industrial processing first and then piped
it to nearby farmlands for irrigation.
The vast Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works farm at Werribee —
some 27,000 acres, less than 20 miles
from the city—was another example of
multiple use of water. (In this particu-
lar case the water comes from the flush-
ing of thousands of toilets and, acre for
acre, the Werribee farm would be one of
the most highly productive in the world.)
Industry could, and would, do much
to develop the re-using of available
water in the future, both from the need
to conserve supplies and for economic
reasons, said Mr Moffat.
But with 90 per cent of the work
force employed in industry, it was fairly
apparent that in the next 50 years in-
dustry was going to need more water.
Water, he suggested, would become
just another commodity to be transported
to where it was needed most and which
did not belong where it fell.
Girls and Rural Training
Agricultural colleges face female invasion
Why don’t girls go to agricultural col-
leges such as Hawkesbury in NSW
and Dookie and Longerernong in Vic-
toria?
They don’t, but the reason is not that
there is any official Government policy
in either State debarring them.
It’s just that if a girl applies she is
told that there is no accommodation
and no provision for girl students at these
institutions.
Now the girls, or some of them, are
campaigning to breach the walls sur-
rounding these all-male seats of learning.
Leader in the campaign is a Mrs
Neville Haughton, wife of a soldier
settler at Benalla in northern Victoria,
and herself a graduate in agricultural
science at Melbourne University.
Apparently the Dookie (Vic.) rules
state that a girl over 18 can enter if
accompanied by a chaperone. An inter-
esting possibility, but as the waiting list
for boys is already long and as there
is no accommodation anyway, a test
case is unlikely.
Male reaction is a bit unfair to
Mrs Haughton.
It stems from the known fact that
agricultural colleges breed a capable and
rather manly type of student. They are
not schools for over-sensitive youths
interested in taking piano lessons.
The facts of farming life are not
always pleasant. During his course the
student must become familiar with in-
testines, urine and similar things. A
weak stomach is no help.
But there is no reason really why this
in itself should be sufficient reason to
decry the idea that girls should be per-
mitted to attend the agricultural colleges.
After all, the nursing profession has
managed to cope rather well without its
members losing femininity. The pro-
portion of nurses who marry doctors is
said to be high.
In America, girls naturally attend the
equivalents of our agricultural colleges.
Thoughtful diplomates of Australian col-
leges who have visited these institutions
have often said that the female influence
is good.
The fact that the colleges give diplo-
mas, and not degrees, may be the reason
that fewer girls than Mrs Haughton
imagines will join in the campaign. Girls
of course can, and do, enter veterinary
science and agricultural science in the
universities. These days the diploma
does not carry the weight it used to.
Mrs Haughton is inviting girls to write
to her at her Private Bag, Benalla. She
may yet produce a long list of girls keen
to do an agricultural diploma course.
It is worthwhile noting that Victoria
now has its first privately endowed agri-
cultural college—the Marcus Oldham,
near Geelong. It would not be sur-
prising if this institution considered the
possibility of taking in girl students.
The overall remedy might be a gradual
elevation of the courses available at
agricultural colleges to degree status.
This would take the load off the univer-
sities in the appropriate faculties and
might induce the girls to come forward
in sufficient numbers to warrant building
dormitories for them.
