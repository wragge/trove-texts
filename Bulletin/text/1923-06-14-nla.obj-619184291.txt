MAN6ROVITE LEATHER or RAW-HIDE BELTING
LOWERS OPERATING COSTS.
Wherever Mangrovite Belting is installed there is an appreci-
able difference in the running cost of the plant owing to its
power-saving grip and absence of production delays for over
hauls or breakdowns.
Experienced manufacturers consider this continuous savin"-
completely offsets the difference in first cost between Man-
grovite Belting and cheap inferior grades.

Wings and Song
iDid the dry land resound with song when
Life’s indomitable pioneers climbed gasping
from the sea? Did those long-suffering pil-
grims utter “melodious noises” as they
passed upvyard from the dark waters and
entered their celestial city of rare wind and
sunlight? No! Not till they had recovered
their lost wings could they regain their
gift of song; and even as we watch, ptero-
dactyls vast as aeroplanes darken the sun
and deafen us with their screams and roar
of leathery wings tearing the air, as they
vanish down time. For a moment there is
silence; then falls upon our ears that first
burst ol melody that made the heavens mute;
still our souls hear in all great music the
triumph of that wondrous Hallelujah
Chorus when the reptiles put off their rep-
tile bodies and rose immortal on sunlit wings,
singing for _ very ecstasy because they had
to sing, while the mountains and the trees
bowed themselves, and nature
knew such harmony alone,
c-ould hold all Heaven and earth in happier union.
The birds have never forgotten that moment.
Their song to-day is the deathless Iliad of
their race. It tells of prisoned life brooding
on freedom, of reptile terror wriggling under
cruel claws, of lizard eyes, heavy with heroic
dreams, blinking upward at the sun. It tells
of steadfast faith that through aeons of suf-
fering and death at last won wings for the
wingless and song for the silent. So the
song ot the birds is more than joy: it is
ecstasy—that heaven - of emotion wherein the
soul, hovering over itself, sees joy as the
fulfilment of all its suffering.
In the quietude of mountain gullies we
listen with sudden awe to the limpid wild
notes of these transfigured reptiles that once
•rawled on their bellies, hideous, scaly, dumb,
mt which now nest high in the shadowy
lassatras, and on gleaming wings vanish in
he melodious blue.
Our wildest flights of fantasy fall short of
lie reality ol our past; all the wonders of
v lice s Wonderland are as nothing compared
nth the amazing miracles of Life. Scraps
, JOly turn into huge fishes, that leap from
he sea on filmy wings, singing their siren
->ng as they vanish in the fog. Hurled back
the sea, blasted and silenced by the ter-
iblo sun, they crawl ashore to a new exist-
nee, become four-legged reptiles, grow
2athere and wings, -and flash upward
irough the blue, singing their new song,
he mammals, the liignest form of life, also
iade desperate efforts to fly, but only the
ittermouse succeeded; yet the true flight
• the bat is hardly more wonderful than
ie heroic failure of the lemur, the opossum
id the squirrel. These stretched planes of
embrane between their extended legs, and
ught themselves how to glide through the
r from tree to tree. But, shooting rapidly
wntrard oman inclined plane, liow do they
ght without “crashing”? They discovered
hrough what infinite experiment and end-
ai^e!) that they must aim at a lower
mt, and, at the last moment suddenly
leeling upward, so check their speed that
?y can perch with the ease of a bird
lence notes the fact that the voice of the
ing lemur resembles the low cackling of
goose. Bless his great heart!—if he
led to win the song as well as the wings
a bird, clearly it was not through lack of

lures, because failure is the buried foun-

other reptiles, he tried a short cut to

iiaH were straining after wimrs like
ards, he instinctively knew that his
true self was not his frail body, pitifully
helpless in a world of fangs and claws, but
his dawning mind, whose unseen power
already made him all-powerful among the
brutes. For that immortal self he soughl
immortal wings. What matter his buriec
ages of suffering and defeat! With the
race, as with each solitary soul, it is only
the victories that count. Through myriad
years he, too, looked upward for another
world, but beyond the sun. He sought, and
because he sought he found. He grew dimly
conscious of a glimmering universe of ideas
outside his prisoning world of sense: he
looked deeply into the eyes of his mate and
saw a new light shining; the flowers and the
crimson skies and the gentle birds came close
to him; he pondered the mystery of self-
created life, the god-like glory of the sun,
the splendor of the stars, the terror of
thunder-flash and crashing timber, and the
realms beyond the far horizon of the sea. So
the great pinions of Imagination slowly un-
furled, until at last the free soul rose sing-
ing beyond the birds —the sun—the stars; nor
ceased -his seraph-song until, with folded
wings, he bowed down before the throne of
God.
DOWELL O’REILLY.
The Journey and the Grey Hill
I The riot of morning color flew past us, and
our wheels rolled into the heavy gold and
russet and flame-yellow of afternoon. A
little wind, mountain-born and still mountain-
keen, stirred the grasses on the top of each
rounded ridge. We rose on one gear of the
car into fresher air and broader vision, and
fell back on another gear into the sweet
warmth of dreaming valleys—valleys where
tinkling streams sang hidden songs of life
under willow domes .and poplar spires, with
a shy window peeping here and there, brown-
hooded, its small panes like milky moonstones
in the half-shadow. A liop-kiln pushed its
round shoulders out of the trees and laughed
a low burly laughter; and once, near the
white ribbon of road, an undershot water-
wheel turned slowly—so slowly that the un-
broken water ran with an oily sleepiness
ibout the gentle descent of its vivid green
loats. Green, soft weed growing on motion,
'rowing on industry, made man’s part in
he affair so akin to nature’s that it seemed
he valley had signed a truce between them,
truce of little labor and small gains.
On the next hilltop the air from the inoun-
ains blew more keenly; and we saw'the flat
rey country and the straight reach of the
iver, a steely gleam of water shoaling into
date ripples and darkening under the west-
rn bank into deeps of indigo. The sheen
f water ran to an arrow-point, and beyond
liat to an oblique line of light feathered with
ull grey; and we lost it at last to the south
’here a hump-backed bridge lifted itself from
ie hazy plain, the approach at either end
mere smother of vapory light. Our wheels
irnecl north on the white raised road over
ie marshes; and our driver deemed it right
1 put on additional speed.
A lonely house, square and harsh on the
eeless waste, was the sole sign of human
ibitation ; and even this seemed more dead
an alive, for no smoke came from the low
nnney, and the bare windows were closed.
was only when we had passed it that,
ikmg back, we saw the low sun light up
l the small panes of that haggard glass into
dden topaz flame. The bare 'thing man
d set in the wilderness became the very
:ais and centre of the evening, flashing back
at wonder of light and shouting in tones
flamboyant magic the triumph of a day.
3sar s last triumph surely; for the con-
eror of the world was even then dying in
i western woods.
The little town was wrapped in a brown
>om as we approached it. Faint lights
•wed here and there; but even the open
>ps were dim behind the invisible, huddled
ips of wares which day had exhibited to
» crooked streets. The squat spire of the
irch made a dark outline against the sky
1 somewhere hidden behind garden walls
monograph bellowed a comic song to bray-
;s of metallic laughter. The hotel lay just
the other side of the town—a low, broad
ite-washed place, which cried cleanliness
1 comfort at the first glimpse. All the
y up, the circular drive was scented with
oming lavender—the little lavender that
kes garden-edges—until we turned by tin-
ner marked “Bar”; then the lavender
lgled with another fragrance as sharp and
tetrating. Lavender and whisky—but in-

effect of the war on the peasantry, of the

icism, and, I think, of the Baconian

knitted scarlet wool; then -she became grey
and shapeless, and went hurrying down the

Firestone
Tyres
on Chicago’s Yellow Cabs travel
millions of miles monthly, actually
covering in one year more than
the distance (93,000,000 miles)
between the earth and the sun.
We state this merely to emphasise the superb
and generous value of the Firestone Cord
construction which, day in, day out, a
laboratory is seeking to increase.
Once you realise what it means to you in
terms of service to have tyre equipment that
is built to this standard of “ most miles per

the most practical way the industry knows,
we are convinced you will specify always

Gum-Dipped Cords
formless thought, with the sombre atmosphere
of my mind. I was not sad. Sadness is
an active state of feeling; mine was merely
passive. There was nothing sad about the
market girl who had passed me; she was only
in a hurry, eager to perform some task, to
escape some blame. I was neithei eager noi
in a hurry. I knew of warmth and pleasanf
things to eat and drink in the hotel below;
they were not less pleasant for the keeping,
h U t they were not worth thinking of here
on the morning hill.
A second market woman passed me, walk-
ing more rapidly than I. She was huge, as
the other had been slim, heavy in her brisk
movement, and rolling a little with her own
weight. I did not see her face, and she did
not turn to look back ; but I saw her feet
and ankles —thick ankles in enormous boots
—crashing before me into the greyness, beat-
ing down the hard stones while she carried
her basket like a solid emblem of purpose
and zeal. I wondered vaguely if the years
and the road would make the woman who
looked back like the woman who went
straight on. , , , ,
And now I paused by a little field where
nothing grew. It had a fence about it but
it seemed as if nothing had ever grown there,
nothing ever could grow. I wondered why
they had enclosed it, and what its purpose
might be; and then suddenly I understood.
The formless morning, the empty field, the
grey light, were all symbols of the present,
symbols of me and of my grey mood and. of
the road that went up and down linking
market woman to market woman, year to
year, nothing to nothing. I closed my eyes
and, seeing nothing, reached out my hands
and grasped great handfuls of . nothing-
grey nothing, cold nothing, the nothing the
field symbolised....
“Stop!” said Peter, with a wave of her
dimpled but emphatic hand. “Does, this get
to anything, or does it go on like this for-
ever?”
“The average length of a modern master-
piece,” I replied, “is about 400 pages. This
being in the nature of a super-masterpiece
wav be expected to run to 500.”
“It’s a crime,” she said, and jabbed .her
needle with quite unnecessary violence into
the white thing she held.
“On the contrary, Peter, listen to the
words of a great authority on style. This
is what Flaubert thinks of it; ‘The. most
beautiful works are those which contain the
least matter. I believe that the future of
art is in these channels.’ ”
“That’s rubbish,” said Peter.
And when I come to think of it it does
seem rather absurd to pretend that your
thirst will be the better quenched because you
drink out of an empty glass.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Also the Woman Novelist
As when man graciously admits that
woman is right enough in her place, but that
she has her limitations and these should
never be forgotten, don’t you know,, so we
are also frequently told that despite the
woman-novelist’s latter-day prominence, she
is emotional, and only succeeds where the
emotions are to be expressed ; also, that she
is unconquerably autobiographical by con-
trast with her novel-writing master, man.
It could be logically argued that the great
novelist is that one, male or female, who
takes characters from life and reproduces
them as he (or she) saw them and felt them
and conceived their idiosyncrasies,! perhaps
exaggerating them as the playwright has to
overstress the peculiarities of the persons of
his play in order to compass them within his
limited space of time. But giving in that
argument, and to meet the complainant on
his (or her) own “autobiographical” ground
where did Dickens get David Copperfield
but from himself? Who was Micawber but
a distorted image of his own father? Or
Mrs. Nicklebv but an exaggeration, however
indirectlv suggested, of his mother? Who
were Harry Lorrequer and Charles O Malley
and Tom Burke but images of Lever’s own
imagination of the man he would have been
an ho could? Does not Stevenson, the son
of a long line of very Scottish ancestors,
pity himself, thrown out upon the farther
islands of the Pacific, as a victim of the
“true romance of history/’ and palpably pic-
-ture himself as the man who would have done
great things, as adventurer nnd even pirate,
if he had had the physical strength to go to
sea and do them? What are the novels, of
Chambers, in many respects the greatest
literary artist America has produced in re-
cent years, but looking-glass pictures of him-
self playing at love and airing his Wonderful
knowledge of natural history ? Even Wil-
liam Dean Howells, the true “dean of
American novelists, was frankly auto-
biographical in most of his stories. Bulwer
Lytton was himself through all his books,
admirable as two or three of them are. As
for Thackeray, the reader who can’t see. him
standing in mid-stage jn “Pendennis and
“Phillip” is intellectually blind and ought to
be prevented by his fond relatives from read-
ing any more of the books, which clearly he
doesn’t understand. .
Woman, being usually the more suffering
victim of emotions, and feeling their effect
and impact more poignantly than man—as
the author of “This Freedom” explains, so
far as I am able to get a line on what he is
getting at —is naturally more addicted to
expressing them as she has felt them, when
she takes to ink and paper. But not so
much as you would expect. In this genera-
tion there have been written , five or six big
stories about American politics, their devi-
ousness and deceptiveness and pretentious-
ness and general corruptibility and hoggish
greediness. First among these one would
respectfullv place Alfred Henry Lewis s
“The Boss.” that incredible, true, story of the
dominance over American politics exercised
by “Boss” Croker, the Irish blacksmith’s
laborer; then “Diplomacy,” an anonymously
-published book, which in the long run was
admitted to be the work of John Hay, states-
man. diplomatist and poet. At least a good
third is Gertrude Atherton’s “Senator
North,” a very classic of American political
stories. As a novel of American life, and
typical at that, where is there a finer , story
than Mrs. Atherton’s “Patience Sparhawk !
Since Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote about the
old witch-killing. Magdalen-branding days of
early New England, where is there a com-
peer to Mary ’Wilkins? Is there to-day a
brighter unsexed novelist than Mary Roberts
Reinhart? Did ever Dickens draw more
fancirul or more humanly appealing charac-
ters than those which Sarah P. McLean
Greene threw into “Flood Tide” and “Wins-,
low Plain”—a book which it is my privilege
to own as a present from John Farrell. If
it is a matter of history, who superintended
John Richard Green’s incomparable short
history of the English people but the woman
who was John Richard’s most capable wife?
Anyone who wants to read the true romance
of womanhood, written-romantically and im-
‘personally, may find it in the books of Kate
Douglas Wiggin, Alice Began Rice, and
especially in Miriam Michelson s audacious
hut beautiful “In the Bishop’s Carriage.”
If the woman writer is an emotionalist,
she is also an adorer, a self-sacrificing high
appraiser of the other sex (as from Dido’s
time) and of children. You find this in
Mrs. Humphry Ward, in Ouida, even in
.Mrs. Henry Wood, and in so many more
modern books that I would not bo astonished
to learn that the author of “This Freedom”
was really a woman, declaring thus that
repudiation of sex which is so evident in all
the best books of the oest woman writers,
whether in fiction, history, or whatever else.

“A writer wrote of the hearts of men,
And he followed their tracks afar,
For his was a spirit that forced his pen
To write of the things that are.”
—Henry Lawson.
Where the Wokkek flounces the mantelpiece
Or fringes the kitchen shelf,
Where hessian doors hide earthen floors,
And the croclcery-ware is delf,
There lies her book in a sacred nook,
And it tells of the things that are,
From one seaboard to the next seaboard ;
For the writer has travelled far.
There's a grey-haired widow on Yanko Creek
And a young wife out on the Bland,
Who feel the strength of the word she wrote
Like the grip of a helping hand;
They have far more heart for the washing-
day,
More ease on the bright bush-track,
As to and fro’ to the creek they go
And carry the water back.
There are some that trudge with the bullock
teams *
When their men go out'for wool,
Who have learnt at night and can read and
write, v
Though they’ve never been to school;
But it is not a novel or magazine
That is most in the rough brown hand;
Youth turns with age to her thoughtful page
That they both can understand.
The squatters’ wives have their novelettes
And their stories of Araby,
With a trip to Sydney now and then,
And a glimpse of the rolling sea;
They give small thought to the rough bush
homes
And the sorrows and pleasures there,
As they ponder the latest fashion notes
And the dresses their' sisters wear.
The women of hut and tent and camp
Are in Mary Gilmore’s ken;
For she knows the lives of the bushmen’s
wives
As our Lawson knew the men.
The Digger’s bride from the other side
Finds many a line to” quote,
And many a homesick heart is cheered
By the strength of a word she wrote.

Jim GRAHANE.
Hellenism
" J.8.D.” winds up the controversy: —
Jack Lindsay has devised a unique method jgfe r
disputation; he loftily presents fallacies as
and argues from the resulting premises. Thg High
Mind has been deposed (only temporarily, let us
hope) in favor of the High Hand.
My original contention was that Australian
writers do not need to seek inspiration in ancient
Greece; that all true artists have written effectively
of their own period or country or both. I had
practically the whole of literature from which to
choose examples in support of my point, and so I
took a comedy by one of the few writers whom
Vision has endorsed with its approval—S'hakspeare.
Whereupon Jack Lindsay:—
The reference to “As You Like It” would make
it appear that “J.8.D.” has hurriedly looked through
his Shakspeare to find a play with a setting that
might be called contemporary. If .he imagines that
the Forest of Arden with its Phoebes and exiled
Dukes and the gay lasciviousness of the wooing of
Rosalind ever existed anywhere, then the least I can
say is that he has a weird conception of actuality.
I can only reply that the Forest of Arden is as
tangible an actuality to this day as the New Forest
or Chingford Woods. The family of Mary Arden,
Shakspeare’s mother, was named after it; the poet
played in its glades as a little boj% and every Shaks-
pearean commentator of my acquaintance is agreed
that the forest scenes in “As You Like It” were
inspired 'by Arden. “No,” I can hear Jack Lindsay
stubbornly insisting. “There’s a mistake somewhere.
No true poet would so lower himself as to write
about a place he knew.” So I will turn from Shak-
speare with the remark, in passing, that the incom-
parable Falstaff and his military and other friends
were just the kind of people the poet and Ben Jonson
would have met in the inns they patronised, to
Aristophanes whom Vision also acclaims. In Vision
Jack Lindsay “wants to be young as Aristophanes
was young,” and in The Bulletin he considers
Aristophanes young “because he wrote the splendid
comedy of the Lysistrata.” Whether Aristophanes
was younger mentally than Shaw is, whether he
drew women better than Shaw —these .are matters of
opinion. But one thing, anyhow, is certain: Aris-
tophanes wrote as persistently about his own period
and his own city as any modern journalist. In the
Lysistrata (a pacifist propaganda play that was as
topical n® any modern revue) he did precisely what
1 suggest the editors of Vision should do—addressed
his gifts to the interpretation of an age, a people
and an environment with which he was familiar.
And, finally, as to the bacchanalia, which I
defined as “collective drunkenness of a bestial nature
conjoined-with tribadism”: —
Does “J.8.D.” seriously think we advocate a
Dionysiac ritualf Dionysos is the symbol of the
mental desire for a bacchanalia.... What has
Beethoven, whose music is saturated with the
bacchanalian spirit, to -do with, a robber Baron?
The false premise here is that the bacchanalian
spirit represented what Beethoven meant, by gaiety
and rapture. The. very • fact that .Jack Lindsay
disowns the Dionysiac ritual is proof sufficient of
the quality of the spirit which inspired that ritual.
Catholics are not ashamed of the Mass or Mohamme-
dans of observing the month Ramadhan. But any-
civilised modern would be revolted at the lugubrious
and unscientific debauches which were the expression
of the Dionysian superstition; nor did the civilised
ancients betray a mental, or any other sort of
desire for a bacchanalia. The baser type of robber
Baron did in the Dark Ages, just as the baser type
of bottle-oh does to-day. But what is Vision
doing in such a galley?
A Satchel of Books
The Primrose Path, by Arthur Mills (Duckworth).
A book of sensational short stories dealing chiefly
with the rtight life of London and high play at
cards. The best of an unconvincing lot is the one
from which the volume takes its name.
The Fishes of South Australia, by Edgar R*
Waite, F.L.S., C.M.Z.S. (S. Aus. Govt. Printer).
One of an admirable series of handbooks of the
flora and fauna of S. Aus. issued by the local branch
of the British Science Guild. The author, who is
the Director of the Museum in Adelaide, has turned
out a painstaking, comprehensive and copiously
illustrated volume.
The Important Pictures of the Louvre, by Florence
Hey wood (Heinemann). An up-to-date second
edition of what is really a treatise on painters and
painting, with the pictures of the great French
collection as illustrations. The author is Art Lec-
turer in English at the Musfe du Louvre, and
knows what she is talking about. A handy little
book both for the few who can take it to France
with, them and for the multitude interested in art
who will never have the tare thither.
Black Oxen, by Gertrude Atherton (John Murray).
This is the 24th novel by this prolific writer. Yet it
is no pot-boiler, as one might expect, but a clever
and entertaining study of a woman whose youth has
been restored to her by the rejuvenating treatment
of a Viennese doctor, while her mind retains all the
wisdom she has stored up in her long experience and
her various liaisons. Mary Ogden, who has been the
belle of New York, returns after the war, and is taken
to be her own illegitimate daughter. That does not
dim the splendor of her conquests, and the situation
gives Miss Atherton an opportunity to draw some
excellent pictures of American society, whose younger
set does not meet with her approval.
Oxford Oddities, by V. J. Seligman (Allen and
Unwin). A collection of sketches of present-day
life on the banks of the Cherwell and thereabouts.
Much of it will be interesting to old Oxonians as
evidence of the changes that have come since their
day. “It would frequently happen that an officer
who had failed to obtain speedy demobilisation would
come up as a freshman to find his former study-fag
a second-year man. Such division as existed was
lather between those who had served in the war and
those who had come straight from school, but even
here the division was not clear cut.” Apart from
these sidelights the yarns are bantering-little affairs,
such as the editors of undergraduate magazines love.
The Mercantile Marine, by E. Keble Chatterton
(Heinemann). This author, who has written much
about ships and the sea, now outlines the history
of the merchant service from the days of the
ungainly single-sailed tubs wallowing in the Medi-
terranean to those of the modern steam mammoths
of the Atlantic, and conveys some idea of the effect
that history has had on the wider history of the
race. It is a bit of good work that could have
come only from the hand of a man fortified by a
tremendous amount of research. Some day this
island Commonwealth is going to develop a partic-
ular interest in the mercantile marine, and mean-
time the facts so interestingly set forth here won’t
come amiss.
Matahari, by H. O. Morganthaler (Allen and
Unwin). The impressions of a Swiss who pottered
about the Siamese-Malayan jungle inspecting mining
propositions. You learn early that “we orten
followed for hours the big oval foofstens [or
elephants] through the jungle, and sometimes th
roof of leaves closed over them and us so that
had to fall on our knees and could hardly cr * w *
through even in this lowly position. ao wnen
you have readjusted your mind as to the size o
elephants you are prepared for anything. otm,
there are interesting little snapshots of the jungle
and its men —and women. Morganthaler harps a
good deal on the women; but his point of view
is that of a precocious schoolboy seeing his nrpr
ballet-girl in tights.
Fiery Particles, by C. E. Montague (Chatto and
Windus). The nine stories in this book display a
wit and fancy that recall the late H. H- Munro
(“Saki”), who was killed in France in 1916- Mon-
tague, however, is a finer ironist than Munro, ana
has a richer mode of expression. His first tale,
“Another Temple Gone,” is a delightful study ot
three Irish policemen failing to suppress an illicit
still. The second, “Honors Easy,” is based on the
diverting discoverv that war decorations increase in
proportion to the recipients’ distance from the front
line. In “The First Blood Sweep” the humor gets
grimmer, even gruesome, and the reader appreciates
the author’s merciless mockery of funk-hole ameni-
ties among crude, dull men. In this narrative also
there are sundry allusions to the sporting instincts
of the English-speaking warriors, one triumphant
Cocknev clinching an argument on the subject with j
“Wot mide th’ Austrylians tike Polygon V ood ?
Down’t orl the worl’ know they was after the riee-
eourse?”
The New Boswell (John Lane). F. M. Ireeman
was the first to conceive the idea of modernising
Pepys, and now that the device is staled he has
turned to Boswell. “The New Boswell” purports
to be an up-to-date record of the doings and sayings
of Johnson in Elysium. Johnson holds forth on
Modern Journalism, the Labor party, Bolsheviks,
Auction Bridge and much else in characteristic vein.
As in his “Diary of the Great Warr,” the author
uses his puppets to scarify modern abuses. Johnson
has just finished a polysyllabic denunciation of
bureaucrats before whose “intolerable exactions the
worst oppression of the old absolute monarchies
pale.”
“ ‘Then, sir,’ he proceeded, ‘apart from these
inquisitorial forms with which they harry us, observe
how the Apostles of Freedom curb our rightful liber-
ties in a hundred other ways as well. Not only
must we do, we must even feel, what they enjoin.
Sir, they will not even allow a man to be thirsty
except at stated hdurs. Now, sir, had Charles 1.
gone to so odious an extreme of tyranny as this, 1
should not have found a word to say against those
who cut off his head.’ ”
“Boswell: ‘What, sir? You would then have
defended regicide?’
“Johnson: ‘Aye, sir! And if popular govern-
ment were susceptible of decapitation, how would l
not glory in democraticide!’”
Freeman’s new medium, which he handles with a fine
sense of period and character, has the advantage of
being much harder to imitate than the other.
“J.F.H.”’: Ooulson Kernahan, in his new book,
“Celebrities,” tells tales about Sir Henry Irving and
poet Swinburne. As regards Swinburne the curtain
has been lifted before (though not by biographer
Gosse), but this is probably the first time that
Irving's liquorings have been mentioned. A less ob-
jectionable yarn is told about the late Guy Boothby.
It was at the time Deeming was in evidence. J. K.
Jerome is said to have jocularly remarked to Boothby:
“A case of marrying in haste and cementing at
leisure.” Guy rejoined: “Rather a case of objecting
to wives in the abstract but not in the concrete.”
Kernahan reports the late Lord Northcliffe as saying
of his brother Harold Harmsworth, now Lord Roth-
ermere: “He’s a marvel. I’ve got ideas, but he has
brains for management compared with which mine
are small. Any success I have made is due as much
to Harold as to me. If he were not in the counting-
house. I would not be able to do what I am doing in
the editor’s room.”

Just Charming.
By “PHLOX.”
“ A CAREER is all right, Audrey, as
7% far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s heart.”
“I suppose, Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.”
“les. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
“Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archaeology, but
there’s something wanting.”
“And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I’ve been through the same thing
myself, and I know—it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married;
then i realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
You remember that jolly girl who passed so
br .lliantly in Arts! She’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
“And I think, Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit of
flufiiness about a woman.”
"What do you mean?”
"I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
“But I don’t happen to have fluffy hair.”
“Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
ar.t. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet Uncle at 6 o’clock, and it’s nearly
that now—I must be going. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested when she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Come in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered, bhe had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use Stallax,” said Mrs.
Livingstone, and I find it makes the hair
beau tit ully glossy, fluffy and easy to dress.”
“And that’s just what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
“Do you ever use a hair tonic?”
“No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I intend to
turn over a new leaf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simply
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay rum, and rub into
the scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone, “a little while ago I was
getting quite grey, and I happened ta hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for twp
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.’'
“My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin food, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax. It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worn-out skin
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
some fine day one of your friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin, but it’s like a baby’s.’”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my
place when you have time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair. Believe
me, my husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and i3 delighted to hear people whis-
per as we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she just charm-
ing?'”

An Old Garden.
I know a garden by the sea,
Set round wuh walls of rosemary;
Along the jasmine-shaded walks
Pale lilies bend on slender stalks;
Bes.de the rose-entangled porch
The lupin lifts a goluen torch.
There is a fountain on the lawn
Where blackbirds drink at dewy dawn;
Through lilac-trees the sea-wind sings
Strange songs of long-forgotten th.ngs;
A seagull, frail of wing and old,
Hunts gravely in the garden mould.
The garden stands neglected, lone;
Outside the sea s soft monotone
Gives to the silent, crescent bay
The memory of a vanished day;
Long moon-shafts, silvery and slim,
Light the old fountain’s mossy rim.
Yet it must ever be to me
A place of mirth and melody:
Even though winds are singing low
Where now she rests, who long ago
Came hither with the rosemary
And set this garden by the sea.

Crystal Gazing.
The round black pool is full of lights—
Blue pictures on a yellow glow-
As when the moon of autumn nights
In whispering boughs is hidden low,
And strange tall spirits walk the laud,
Dim presences on girding air—-
A shoulder curve, a. moving hand,
A sudden breath that chills the hair.
Dark crystal, in your deeps I find
Things stranger than ail books have told-
The fiery crystal of the mind
Runs off in little flakes of gold
That hide in paths of blackest gloom
Where, rank on rank, the tall reeds brood;
And songs unborn await their doom —•
The subtle calling of a mood.
I gaze; and at a. silent cry
An angel troubles all the flood.
The reeds are shaken with a sigh,
The heavy marge is lapping blood;
A passion stirs in .that, unrest,
Surges and calms to holy fire;
Then sparkles on the pool’s dark breast
To all the stars of all desire.
Deep of my dreaming, who shall know
The whole of wonder more than these
Dark drops that out of silence flow
* To touch the white eternities!
Unending time, unending space!
Dip the swift pen and let it drink.
Thought has a boundless chart to trace
With black infinity of ink.

Something within
That will not be subdued makes plaintive cry
For desert sunsets and a spangled sky;
Unchecked to stand upon far hills, and shout
To dawn and sunrise; bathe in the clouds,

In moon and starshine,, snatching at the
strands
Of God’s innocent sun with eager hands.
I am denied
What other men have easy power to find—
Joy in the simplest things tVit please man-
kind :
Smile of a wife, the close warmth of a hearth,
A small child to run laughing in my path!
How I have tried
To love the idols of my neighbors’ shrine,
But know that they, alas! can ne’er be mine!
I am warm clay
Half-moulded ’neath a dreaming potter’s
hand, 1
And, when some comrade called, put by to
stand
In some odd niche, to harden and to dry;
A mute reminder to the passers-by
On some bright day,
More purpose I’d have served in the bazaar
If I had been a common water-jar!

The Raggedy Man.
The Raggedy Man goes past the gate,
His flute held high to a witching tune;
His shadow falls across the fence,
Purple as roses born in June.
Beware, for he’ll steal your heart if he can,
This Raggedy-taggedy Gipsy Man!
He’ll eat your bread and he’ll pay you well
With a sonnet sweet or a snatch of song;
Perhaps he’ll only kiss your hand
Or fling a smile as he goes along;
And if this should anger you, Jane or Ann,
Well, that’s not the fault of the Raggedy
Man.
He knows how the morning dyes her hair
In a jug of gold whi h cue sunbeams till;
He knows that young moon-maid°ns dream
As they sleep at night on the hill;
He knew it ere ever the world began,
Oh, wise is the Raggedy-taggedy Man!
One tune he learnt from the wind in the trees,
Another he stole from the fairy Shee,
One he found in a singing stream.
And one in children’s eyes maybe.
From earth to the stars is a finger’s span
For the feet of the Raggedy-taggedy Man.
The Raggedy Man goes past the gate,
His shadow flinging a purple glow,
And through the misty dark there comes
IPs laughter, silver-soft and low.
Latch the door, lady! For. sure, if he ean.
Your h—rt he’ll be stealing, this Raggedy

SETTING THE WRECKER UP IN
BUSINESS.
In its sane and honest days Labor aimed at
nationalisation—at the ownership of big
things by the people for the people’s profit.
But the white-ants got to work, and most
of the supporters whose support was worth
having left the movement by degrees. They
found that so much was the ideal perverted
that the people were never to really own any-
thing. Everything was really to be owned
by the private and mostly foreign capitalists
who lend money at heavy interest, and who,
unlike an ordinary private owner, have to get
their dividend whether it is earned or not.
They found, too, that the building of £lOOO
Avorth of tangible and more or less productive
Avorks was made a handy excuse for the
borrowing of £l5OO or £2OOO, so that the
people, under “national OAvnership,” did worse
than oAvn nothing—they owned less than
nothing. Then the policy of big loans and
“nationalisation” was extended to petty,
ludicrous things that Averen’t worth while
even if they had yielded a profit, which they
never did, and these furnished highly-paid
billets for party heelers, who began to dig
themselves in and take possession of the
land and the fulness thereof.
The honest old ideal of socialisation hav-
ing been thus prostituted and abandoned,
there began to be exceedingly “advanced”
theories about the ownership of industries,
not by the people who had provided the
money and organising ability to found and
run them, and who stood the preliminary
losses, nor by the nation at large, but by
the ‘‘workers” employed in them. Thus arose
the cry in the N.S.W. coal districts, “The
mines for the miners.” The miners were to
take over ttie mines and fix the price of fuel
—presumably so that there would be more
wage for less work. They would own un-
worked as well as worked coal deposits—
necessarily, else the opening of new mines
by new miners would break the monopoly
almost before it was established. They would
decide the number of the coal-digging aris-
tocracy and regulate admission to that rich
and favored body. They would, also of
necessity, control and prohibit importation
of coal, otherwise their business would die.
And presumably the coal famine would be
so chronic that most other businesses would
die, and after that most people would die, or
else leave. A. C. Willis, who has just been
elected President of the Labor party in N.
S. Wales, was careful to explain that the
miners were quite willing that the pits should
be national property—the property of every-
body. They didn’t seek ownership. All they
asked for was sole control. So long as they
had the entire kingdom and its contents any-
body could have the crown. The general
application of this policy would, of course,
put the country in the hands of a few close
corporations of producers, who would pre-
sently forget to produce, and they would be
in the hands of a few great union or Bol-
shevik bosses, who would presently be the
only affluent men in the country. Australia
has no hereditary landed aristocracy whose
millions can be transferred to the people’s
new despots; but it has leaders of industry
who are suspected of some wealth. Such a
one is McKay of the harvester, who founded
the new town of Sunshine. It is a rare
thing for a new town to rise in Australia,
and especially to rise without State loans or
State land-jobbing. There are some 2000
workers at Sunshine, all paid by results, and
earning, when the results are good, up to £l3
per week. There would be no room for such
as McKay, who produces harvesters,
in the Red Objective land, but there
would be a great deal more room for
Garden and Willis, who produce noises and
strikes. What else they hope to get nobody
knows, but lots of people can guess.
* * * *
Lenin, the petty Russian aristocrat who
turned red revolutionary and became a king
and, according to Garden, also an enor-
mously rich man, was the founder of the
la,tter-day “socialisation” movement. His
address to the Russian factory-workers was
to the point: “The factories are yours.
Knter and take possession.” They did both.
1 ossibly Lenin was a victim to the crazy
idea that any intricate business can be run
more profitably by wordy amateurs who
have nothing at stake than by experts who
have to make success or financially perish.
I ossibly he was just revolushing. Anyhow,
when the experts were killed or otherwise
removed, production fell off by anything
up to 95 per cent. There is really no mar-
gin in industry for wild experimenting. In
VY estralia, where the Premier has a griev-
ance over the manufacturing situation and
other things, the average factory-worker’s
output last year was of the value of £287.
He got £192, which left £95 to cover fuel,
three sets of taxes, rent, interest, insurance,
discount, lighting, freight, bad debts, travel-
ling expenses, repairs to buildings and plant,
replacement of worn-out or superannuated
plant, and a multitude of other things, in-
cluding, a little for the owner of the show.
That kind of balance is easily upset. The
mortality among businesses, through misfor-
tune or through the management being a
shade below the best, is tremendous, as the
bankruptcy records show; and when political
amateurs manage, or where control is vested
in all hands and the cook, the situation is
infinitely worse. Queensland, which was re-
duced in eight years, by even the limited
damage which a mere State Government
could do, from owning 13 per cent, of the
Commonwealth’s factory-workers to owning
10 per cent., is a case in point. The old
Cornish pirate who beguiled a ship worth
£lOO,OOO to destruction and picked up £lOO
of profit among the debris had a costly way
of making a livelihood. But there are thou-
sands of well-meaning people to-day who are
encouraging a few men to pursue the same
calling, on a vastly larger scale, and putting
them in the way of doing it by hand-
ing the Labor movement over to
their control. The wrecking in these
modern cases is of States and not of
ships. There have been instances where the
bulk of the people have had so little interest
in the State that it didn’t really matter to
them whether it was wrecked or not. But
the Australian worker, when he sets tne
Bolshevik in the highest: olaces in his unions,
had better reflect whether he hnsn’t some-
thing to lose. Apart from his liberty, there
is the small matter of his savings-bank de-
posit, for instance.’
ROSA AND JOSEPHA.
Two or three decades ago the world was a
much more primitive place than it is to-day.
Absurd things interested some of the great-
est minds —in England the magic of Mas-
kelyne and Cook ; in the U.S.A., the mon-
sters of the dime shows. The pride of one
of these grotesque collections, superior as a
draw even to Jo-Jo, the dog-faced man, or
the bearded lady, or the living skeleton, were
Rosa and Josepha, the Siamese Twins.
They aroused a morbid attention which was
practically world-wide. So austere a figure
as the late Lord Salisbury is said to have
been exercised over the problem of what
would happen to Rosa if Josepha died, and
vice versa. The prevailing belief was that
each formed the complement of the other —■
that if one went the other would go, too.
And, sure enough, when Josepha died of
catarrhal jaundice in Chicago last
year, Rosa followed her 15 minutes
later. The world had almost forgotten
the well-advertised inseparables in the
stress . of more serious problems, but
at this proof of their mutual depen-
dence interest blazed up again. Cables
flashed round the earth. The unhappy crea-
tures were the subject of special articles in
the medical press. They then relapsed into
oblivion, and humanity has got along well
enough without them ever since.
* * * *
Most parts of the Empire had their Rosas
and Josephas in the troubled period that
ushered in the World War. They were the
star features of the big political dime-shows,
and they never let the public forget it. As
in the case of all undesirable historical
characters, the populace had various oppro-
brious nicknames for them; but mostly they
were known colloquially as Flag-flappers and
Flag-revilers, or as Labor agitators and anti-
Labor agitators. Great men studied their
activities with a certain nauseated interest.
Although the twins usually described them-
selves on the one hand as national patriots,
and on the other as international humani-
tarians, both criminologists and alienists
identified familiar traits in them. Notably
egomania, and the desire to acquire money,
or money’s worth, without undue effort. A
colossal effrontery was the most disgusting
attribute and the chief asset of both. The
mischief they did was incalculable. Most of
the British war-historians agree that Ger-
many would not have fought but for the
row in Ulster which the Kaiser’s Ministers
and war-lords believed to be serious enough
to keep the British Empire permanently
disrupted. Their error lay, of course, in
taking Erin’s Rosa and Josepha seriously.
The Morning Post had reported the present
Prime Minister of Ulster as saying: “I can
testify from my personal knowledge that
Germany and the German Emperor would be
preferred to- the rule of Patrick Ford and
the Molly Maguires.” Major Crawford
had proclaimed that “if Ulster was put out
of the Union he would infinitely prefer to
change his allegiance right over to the
Emperor of Germany.” The Irish Church-
man had said (14/11/T3) : “Should our
King sign the Home Rule Bill the Protes-
ants of Ireland will welcome this continental
deliverer (William II.), as their fore-
fathers, under similar circumstances, did be-
fore.” With the utmost delight the other
twin, speaking now in the nasal accents of
the Yankee De Valera and now in the cul-
tured tones of the disgruntled Casement,
took up such challenges and lised them to
exacerbate that bitterness which is essen-
tial to the political life of every Rosa-
Josepha combination. Never in the history
of the world had enmity between Capital
and Labor been so articulate. And here, too,
Germany was deceived by the bombastic
threats and hypocritical rhetoric of ambiti-
ous faction leaders who did not mean busi-
ness unless it meant good business for them-
selves ; who were not out for a cause but
for jobs or that notoriety which results in
jobs. Anybody who read one of Lloyd
George’s Limehouse speeches might have
been forgiven for assuming that he regarded
rich peers as the chief curse of the United
Kingdom. Anybody who read the speeches
and articles of England’s Tory anarchists on
Lloyd George’s Insurance Act might fairly
have concluded that they regarded the author
as a menace to civilisation. But it was all
inflammatory guff on both sides—the con-
temporaneous equivalent of our own W. M.
Hughes’s denunciation of the Australian
moneyed man for his bowelless indifference to
the sufferings of the poor, and of Joseph
Cook’s denunciation of Hughes as an enemy
of the Empire and a friend of anarchy. The
war found Lloyd George putting up a
record as a bestower of titles on rich men,
and it found W. M. Hughes more jingoistic
than Cook, and the recipient eventually of
£25,000 provided by members of the very
class he had slandered. The peace finds
Ulster out of the Union, yet as loyal as ever;
Sinn Feiners like Cosgrave taking the oath
of allegiance; and the last remnants of the
Old Guard, personified by De Valera, appa-
rently getting ready to do likewise. The
Empire’s first casualties in the war and the
ones it could best spare were its Josepiias ;
and, in the natural order of things, with every
Josepha a Rosa was interred. Class hatred
went as the workers proved they were every
bit as loyal as their employers. Sectarian
differences vanished, as Protestant, Catholic
and Jew went into the line together, and
for a while no one heard his creed insulted
or even criticised. As the Empire came to
realise what ttie war meant, and as it settled
down grimly to the task of saving its life,
it began gradually to forget the egregious
twins who had claimed its attention for so
many years.
* » * *
If the world were swayed by the logic of
events there would never again be room in
the politics of any country for Rosa and
Josepha. Before the war the I.W.W. agi-
tator could only be confronted with a con-
tradictory theory in rebuttal of his conten-
tion that the worker’s community of interest
lay with other workers, irrespective of the
latter’s race or color, and not with his fellow-
nationals irrespective of their class. The
war proved that internationalism is incap-
able of standing up to nationalism for a
moment in face of a world-crisis. German
and British Socialists began hating one an-
other with the same intensity as German and
British shopkeepers or scientists the moment
the war-gong sounded. Had England •or
Australia or any of the allied nations turned
out to have a majority of practising inter-
nationalists, the Socialists of Germany would
not have laid down their arms in edified
approval: they would have immediately en-
slaved their _ enemy brethren in the * holy
name of patriotism. When the white Social-
ists of the Empire arrived in Egypt, they
encountered a type of comrade concerning
whom the I.W.W. orators had said little or
nothing. They scorned to fraternise with
the Gyppo orange-vendors, paper-sellers and
so forth; in fact, the British authorities
complained that the Dominions’ troops
treated the workers of Egypt like dogs.
Later, in Flanders, many of these same
troops met Asiatics of a higher type work-
ing on the roads. It mattered not to the
white soldier whether he had been a Social-
ist or an individualist at home; here he only
knew that he was white and that it was out-
side the sphere of practical politics for him
to be a brother to a colored man. In Aus-
tralia, before the war, Tory agitators claimed
that the R.C. Church was hostile to the
Empire; and they got votes —representing
seats in Parliament and in some cases
Cabinet rank—on the false pretence that
they were loyalists and the objects of their
attacks traitors. The war proved that loy-
alty has nothing to do with religious creeds.
On the AVestern Front French Catholics
killed German Catholics and German Pro-
testants did the same by English Protestants
without allowing any sectarian considera-
tions to intrude into the business.
Australia’s self-styled loyalists dropped
sectarianism during the war for two
good reasons: (1) the Empire was
in no mood to be set by the ears in the
interests ot political adventurers, and (2)
the enlistment figures were daily proving the
K.L. s, like the workers, to be as loyal as
any other section. But the last echoes of the
war are dying away in the plaintive appeals
for work made by ex-soldiers, and ROSA
and Josepha are well in the limelight once
more. The Josepha capitalists, who have
good reason to know what a decent and rea-
sonable man the average Australian worker
is at heart, have begun talking of him as a
congenital criminal again; the Rosa com-
munists are again telling working-class audi-
ences that they must not arm, since their
brethren overseas, white or yellow, German
or Japanese, will never harm them, and that
their only enemies are their employers, and
strikes are rife and prices high as a result.
Advertisement-seeking Hibernians project
themselves into the public eye from time to
time and affront 99 per cent, of the inhabi-
tants with insulting remarks about the
country whose navy is keeping us free, about
the A.1.F., our system of justice, and things
in general. And forthwith advertisement-
seeking Orangemen spring forward and claim
that the Empire is in danger at the hands
of these wandering abuse-mongers, and that
•nothing but a continent-wide crusade against
the R.C. religion, conducted by themselves,
will save the situation. If the' nation were
to infect either Rosa or Josepha* with the
jaundice of a publicity boycott, both would
fall dead almost on the spot. As it is, these
abominable associates continue to live by,
for and on each other; and in a number of
manifestations are doing very well at the
wooden-headed public’s expense.
AUSTRALIA’S GOLDEN HOUR.
I Mr. Berry, the writer of this article, is the market
expert of London Daily News.]
Chief among Australia’s problems under
discussion in London is that of creating
greater markets for her growing volume of
produce. Once that greater outlet is found,
the population she needs for internal develop-
ment and defence will easily be attracted to
her shores. She will then leap forward as
the U.S.A. did last century, and the twen-
tieth century will be her own.
Coupled with the question of greater mar-
kets for Australia is that of closer Inter-
Imperial trade. The two are Inseparable,
and can be settled by the same means. But
in finding a lasting solution, which is not
likely to be upset by party political action
in Britain, Australia will have to drop one
of her pet theories. She will have to scrap
the Imperial Preference proposal, because it
would be unfair to British consumers, im-
practicable, and, even if it were possible, a
tedious way to capture the Homeland mar-
ket for fresh, dried and canned fruits, or any
other form of produce in need of an outlet.
The reason is obvious to one who sees the
problem from the standpoint of the Imperial
capital, though it may be less easy tor an
Australian at home to understand until he
weighs up the question with calm detach-
ment.
The two factors that put Australia at a
disadvantage in competing for the British
home market are high costs of production
and long freights—the longest freights in the
world. Imperial Preference is again being
canvassed by many Australians as a means
of overcoming these disadvantages, and giv-
ing Australia a square chance in competition.
But it would re-act too seriously on the
British consumer. The British is the most
heavily-taxed _ nation in the world, and is
likely to continue so for many years to come.
To hundreds of thousands of families, groan-
ing under this load, the struggle to make
ends meet is as great in the economic sense
as the fight in Flanders was in the military,
xit tne moment there are close upon 1J mil-
lion of unemployed, and a much greater
number are living on the bare subsistence
level. Many families are, in fact, physically
deteriorating because they cannot properly
feed, clothe and house themselves. Half the
£800,000,000 Budget which Britain has to
face this year represents interest on War
Debt. Excluding the new Irish Free State,
which now has its own economic problems to
solve, interest on War Debt is equal to £lO
per head of the population. The other
£400,000,000 required for administrative ser-
vices are equal to a further £lO per head,
making the whole £2O a head in direct and
indirect taxation. I do not know the com-
parative figures for Australia, but they are
considerably lighter. Again, the average level
of wages and returns on profits in Australia
are higher than in Britain, the cost of living
is cheaper, and Australians have a larger
margin for the pleasures and luxuries of life,
and for thrift. Contrasting the economic
positions of the two countries, can Austra-
lians reasonably expect Britons to add to
their cost of living, in order to improve still
further the already higher standard of liv-
ing in Australia ? To fair-minded Austra-
lians there is only one answer.
Yet, despite the disparity, there are thou-
sands of Britons at home who are prepared
to concede Preference to further the ideal of
closer Empire trade, and thousands more
who would do so if they could afford it. But
they realise that it would be unfair to the
mass of _ the population, more especially to
that section who cannot now make ends meet.
So Imperial Preference, at any rate in food-
stuffs, must find a place on the scrap-heap,
and Britons at home and in Australia must
look for a more practical solution. There is
such a solution, and it is one that will bene-
fit both Australia and Britain, and lead
straight to the goal of closer Empire trade
and the development of Australia.
It was an Australian business man.
Arthur C. Derham, of Melbourne, at pre-
sent in London, who introduced to me a
bonus on exports as a practical, fair and swift
solution of a difficulty to which I confess I
had not been able to find an answer. Mr.
Derham is one of a number of Australian
business- men who have examined conditions
from the London angle, and he has been
driven to accept the Government bonus prin-
ciple on Australian exports as the best plan
to offset the high costs of production and
the high freight to Britain. His plan is
practical because: —
1. It will enable Australian exporters to com-
pete successfully with the rest Of the world in
the British home market.
2. It will stimulate production and the develop-
ment of Australia’s resources.


3 It will retain the high-wage level in Australia,
and attract more migrants from the British Isles
to assist in that development.
4 The greater competition in the British home
market will tend to lower food prices and the cost of
living to the mass of the people.
5 This easing of Britain’s burden will re-act on
her ' consuming ' power and her productive energies,
and help British manufacturers against German com-
petitors, who are using the low value of the fraudu-
lent mark to get orders, and against United States
manufacturers, who are protected to the teeth by
high tariffs. _
The bonus would be retained in Australia,
finding its way to the producer. lb e cost
uugiu be met by a tux on lanu values.
There is little doubt that Australian ex-
porters, given the will and the bonus, can
capture the British market for canned and
dried fruits, or any other produce, just as
surelv as they are at the moment scooping
the pool with their apples during what is to
other exporters a close season _in mnglana.
Their chief competitors in fruits are Cali-
fornian exporters, but if Australians get to
work, assisted by a big Government publicity
campaign and the bonus, they can win m a
three years’ fight. That is the time _ mit
that keen business men in London estimate
for its duration.
The bonus principle is not new. Denmark
uses it, and does well in the British market.
If Australia adopts it right away she will
find the spirit of Britain everywhere favor-
able, for the nation at the moment is in the
mood for closer unity. If Australia delays
any length of time she may find new econo-
mic links being forged in Britain’s Slowly
reviving trade, which will make it more dim-
cult to get in. Britain has not yet found
her new economic bearings in the post-war
world, and Australia can help her to find
them and her own. The Commonwealth can
give the lead to the Empire. If other
Dominions should copy the bonus pmn after
Australia’s lead, there will be room for all
in Britain’s home market for several years.
After that time the rest of Europe, with
four hundred million people, will have re-
covered economically far enough to take big
quantities. London can then be made the
Dominions’ great depot for re-exporting sur-
plus produce to all Europe. Another result
will be a development of Australia’s ship-
ping services, which may become prosperous
enough to yield revenue instead of a deficit
to the Commonwealth Government, thus
assisting to nay for the bonus.
By the time Australia is well in the Euro-
pean market, her internal resources will have
developed, and she may need additional mar-
kets for her wheat. China and Japan are
turning more and more to wheat consump-
tion as the economic standard of their living
rises, and Australia would find an outlet
there among 500 millions of people who have
insufficient room to grow supplies adequate
to their increasing needs. Australia, if she
will, can become the world’s greatest granary
as well as its orchard and its wool centre.
As concrete evidence of the tide of events
in Britain the Federation of British Indus-
tries, which represents 20,000 manufacturers
and traders and several hundred millions of
industrial capital, has appointed a committee
of the nation’s leading industrial magnates,
who at the moment of wwiting are studying
how much farther they can use Empire raw
materials in Homeland industries, and help
in other directions towards the ideal of closer
commercial unity. The time for Australia
to make a move is therefore now.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Chance for a Statesman.
A pertinent fact, overlooked at the latest
palaver of Premiers, is that the amounts
collected by the States in income and dividend
taxes, phis their 255. p.h. subsidy from the
customs and excise revenue, almost equal
their annual interest bills. In 1921, accord-
ing to the useful but belated Wickens, the
provincial Government received £9,838,000
under the 255. p.h. arrangement and
£10,180,000 through their income-tax depart-
ments, the total being £17,018,000. That same
year they paid £17,751,000 in interest, which
amount; included the expenses of floating cer- 1
tain Queensland loans. A Commonwealth
‘Treasurer with vision and spirit would offer
to-'assume this interest burden conditionally
: upon the States resigning their claim to the
:255.; ; p.h. of . customs and excise revenue, with-
drawing from . the .field of taxation on in-
comes'and dividends, and undertaking not to
borrow except through . the National Gov-
ernment. In this wa.v lie could realise the
ancient Federal aspiration of taking over
ithe State debts and put an end to the sordid
annual competition for the favors of foreign
moneylenders, besides giving Australia the
boon of one income-tax. To dispose of the
inevitable objections it would be sufficient
to point out that the statutory right of the
State Governments to. the 255. p.h. expired in
July, 1920. Under the arrangement here sug-
gested the income-tax might be devoted to
the only purpose for which it should properly
be employed, that of meeting (and gradu-
ally reducing) the obligations imposed by the
national debt. In Britain, as in the Com-
monwealth, it was originally a war impost.
But in at least two of the States it has been
used (1) to bleed political opponents, (2)
to make productive industries pay the losses
on drunken Government enterprises, and
(3) as a crude alternative to scientific land-
values taxation, which the farmer fears and
the speculator loathes. One advantage of
the present proposal is that it would enable
the Commonwealth to get a fair return from
the citizen who has interests in more than
one State. If there are to be six State
income-taxes with exemptions, and one Com-
monwealth impost restricted to companies,
persons of that description will be on an
excellent wicket; indeed, many in easy cir-
cumstances would be legally exempt. Gro-
tesque as it seems, a company of returned
soldiers engaged in canning mullet would be
liable for Federal income-tax (which means
war tax) according to the Bruce-Page
scheme. But Kidman, the allegedly million-
aire cattleman, would escape.
Denison Miller and His Bank.
When the Labor Government that came into
power in 1910 was launching the Common-
wealth Bank, .Denison/.Miller, who died
suddenly last week, was not the first man it
thought of for the governorship, nor the
second. It was his good fortune that the
others did not think highly of the job. To
the older men in charge oi established institu-
tions, and to the rising hopes in their ser-
vices, there was nothing particularly attrac-
tive about a seven-years’ appointment to
this experiment starting without capital and
with no apparent prospects of handling any
great volume of business other than Govern-
ment accounts. In the early part of its
career it was a very modest affair. _ Not
until the end of the third year were the initial
deficits wiped out. Then the war made
the “Commonwealth” —the war and Deni-
son Miller’s capacity to seize the opportuni-
ties that it offered. The times have really
been very easy for bankers. Douglas, the
English economist, inquired last year
“wnether anyone during this time of indus-
trial depression and labor distress has
noticed any bank premises for sale.” He
went on to say that “while auctioneers’ adver-
tisements of eligible modern factories to be
sold at break-up prices are to be seen on
every hoarding, and while manufacturers are
beginning to compete witfi generals for posts
under the Ilolborn Borough Council, every
bank in the charmed circle has pulled down
its barns to build larger”; in fact, “half of
the London City and Midland’s 151)0 branches
have been opened since 1014, in buildings of
a solid magnificence appropriate to the
temples of a great faith.” In the special
circumstances which, according _to Douglas,
enabled the British banks to do best out of
the war and well out of a peace that has
ruined millions, the “Commonwealth” pros-
pered exceedingly. Having the handling of
all the war loans and pools, and the use, for
short-dated loans, of huge unexpended Gov-
ernment balances, it could not help making
huge profits, more especially as there were no
shareholders or tax-gatherers to worry it.
Denison Miller’s contribution to the
general result was creditable. It was
part of his duty to popularise the war
loans, and he did the job excellently.
Gifted with a talent for the puzzling business
of exchanges, he brought off also in this depart-
ment more than one clever, coup. But the
excessive powers reposed in him —powers
harmless enough in 1013, and necessary,, per-
haps, during the war period, but exorbitant
in circumstances where the institution has
became a lender of 17 millions —betrayed
even this “safe” man into blunders. Infor-
mation w T as sought in Parliament on one
particular point; questions were asked again
and again; and the invariable reply was that
there was no information to give, the Gov-
ernor being a law unto himself. It is un-
necessary at this stage to recall other cir-
cumstances which showed the Governor’s
impregnable position—a position which led
him to treat outside protests and even the
warnings of his own officers with indiffer-
ence. It is contrary to all the principles
of banking that one man, and that a public
servant, should be thus placed, with the
absolute control of millions for advances,
land purchases, building contracts and the
like, the sole judge of his own proceedings,
responsible to himself alone. Though much
of the late Governor’s work was of an en-
during character, and will be remembered
to his credit, the dangerous powers that he
wielded cannot, must not, be transmitted to
his Successor.
Amurath Succeeds Amurath.
Tiie latest Sydney Labor conference has been
making history, of a sort. By ISO votes to
79 it revoked the sentence of expulsion
passed on ex-l’remier Dooley by the A.L.P.
executive. With a gesture equally violent it
cast out of. the executive all those who had
excommunicated Dooley, his followers in the
Parliamentary caucus and his sympathisers
in the Labor leagues and branches. Only
one anti-DooLEY member of the executive was
spared—Mrs. Kate Dwyer. Incidentally,
the political hegemony of “the movement”
was transferred from the A.W.U. to the
Miners’ Federation. In the presidential
election Power, of the A.W.U., was badly
defeated by Willis, the imported secretary
of tne coal-miners and leader of the break-
away section in 1919. Willis calls himself
a guild socialist, but he showed his hand un-
mistakably when the Communists, who have
been rejected with loathing by the British
Labor part-' 7 and the American Labor Federa-
tion, were'admitted, on his casting vote, to
the N. S. Wales A.L.P., with’ full power to
white-ant 'that body, according to ; LeiStin’s
instructions. Also, the Red objective, turned
down last year, was adopted by an immense
majority, and a country delegate who de-
spairingly-interjected that “the Communists
are murdering this party,” was “named”, for
contumacy. The surrender to Moscow is
the. most memorable feature of the confer-
ence. It is far more important in a histori-
cal sense than the revelations about 1 bogus
badges, spurious pem-c-cards,-impersonation,
stolen ballot-papers and faked ballot-boxes
with sliding panels, sickening as they are.
In the alleged triumph of virtue over this
sewer-bred ruffianism and rascalitv there has
been a great deal of humbug. The facts were
whispered about, talked about, even roared
about for years without disturbing the com-
placency of certain alleged reformers who now
pretend to be horrified at their existence. Some
of‘ these eloquent professors of purity (when
it pays) were loudest in the yells of con-
tumely that pursued the late Brookfield and
the ill-fated Catts, who spoke a year too
soon. Meantime, the rank and file of Labor
have little to feel joyful about. For them
the result of the conference is that one set
of bosses has been succeeded by another,
Tammany by the Reds.
Funk, Hesitations and Half-measures.
Tiie never-quite-satisfactorv Minister Chap-
man came out last week with another half-
baked New State scheme. He began brightly
enough by proposing that the south of N. S.
Wales and the south-east of Victoria (fenced
off by the mountains from the main body of
the country) should form a new State, with
Twofold Bay as its outlet. To this the Syd-
ney Telegraph, which generally supports
Chapman and his works, gave assent, only
weeping a little over the impossibility of
the thing:—
The financial difficulties are such' that it seems
likely that many years will elapse before the port
is linked up with the southern line at Bombala, not
to speak of a connection with the Victorian system
at Orbost. As a N.S.W. project a railway through the
mountains to connect with the'ltiverina is, in the
present state of public finance, a matter for the
next generation rather than for this.
The dreadful height to be scaled to reach the
fastness on which Bombala stands is a
mournful bugbear. As a matter of fact,
the town is a little higher than iiazeibi'uok
and not so high as Lawson. There are 60
miles to do the climb in, while the train has
to shin up the wall to Lawson in 59 miles.
Minister Ball hands out longer railways
than that twice a month, provided they are
near Sydney. And “the present state of
public finance” has no connection with the
case, as railways aren’t built out of the hard-
up public finance with the deficit in it, but
out of the superabundant loan, which is more
plentiful these times than ever before. But
though the Telegraph might be the same
old petty-souled affair that it usually is, with
no Australian outlook save the one from
its office window, it seemed possible that
Minister Chapman might have a complete
and tidy scheme till he developed along these
lines:—•
The idea that each new State, in its early stages
at least, should go to the expense of having a
Governor and a separate Legislature is absurd. The
most practical ai rangement would be for them to be
regarded more an Federal provinces, with their own
system of local government, something like the county
councils in England.
Possibly it is some peculiar kink in the Aus-
tralian character which is responsible for
the tendency to drift away after amendments
and side-issues and half-measures and red
herrings whenever something big is in danger
of being done. When a new State is in sight
a strong party is sure to be formed to argue
that a submarine tunnel or a punt would be
better, and if a harbor bridge almost ai’rives
somebody comes with a substitute scheme for
a county council. Chapman’s new “State”
wouldn’t be a State at all. Apparently it
would give up its share in the State Legis-
lature, and sink into a Federal province like
the neglected Northern Territory. To save
the cost of a Legislature and Premier with
the power to build railways and all manner
of works, it would have a Legislature and
Premier (described as a County Council and
President) with the limited powers of the
English county councils, which don’t make
railways or ports, but potter after the minor
jobs. Who would attend to the big things
doesn’t appear—probably no one. Whether
the degenerated Chapman “provinces” would
have Federal representation doesn’t appear
either. This country has never established
a new State since most of it began to manage
its own affairs over 60 years ago, and in this
simple matter it seems ghost-haunted and
hag-ridden by a childish terror of the un-
known. There is not the least desire among
practical patriots to cut Australia into absurd
scraps; indeed, the proposition of the recent
New State conference was that the smallest
existing State should represent the minimum.
Nobody aims at anything like Rhode Island
(U.S.) with 1067 sq. miles of surface
(say, one-twenty-fifth the size of Tasmania),
two State Houses (139 members in all) and
five Federal members. Nor does anybody
propose to copy New Hampshire (U.S.) with
a space of 9032 sq. miles (say, one-third of
Tasmania), two State Houses of 444 mem-
bers altogether, which is one for each thou-
sand inhabitants, and four Federal members
to boot. But the British Government wasn’t
afraid to give complete self-government, and
not some silly parody in the shape of a
county council, to Queensland with a popula-
tion of between 25,000 and 30,000 souls, or
to Westralia when it had less than 50,000.
The results suggest no cause why this should
degenerate into a Land of Dreadful Funk
whenever something much less radical and
venturesome is mentioned. There remains
the bogey about the inevitable, fearsome and
prohibitive cost of any new Government,
wherefore it is proposed to make shift in-
stead with some clique of glorified aldermen.
It. is one of the standing delusions of a com-
munity which is easily deluded. In 1921
(latest available figures) South Aus. ran its
entire Parliamentary machine for £68,935,
Tasmania’s bill was £36,433, which was less
than the commission the Sydney Municipal
Council proposed to pay over the Martin-
place extension. It is hardly worth while
for any community to abandon full powers
of Parliamentary Government in order to
save £36,433.
. A Loan Prophet out of the West.
Popular heroes are made out of all sorts of
material, so it isn’t wonderful that a sec-
tion of the Eastern; press made one out of
.Tames Mitchell, the visiting Premier from
.Westralia. He represents the biggest 4 State,
the one with the biggest, nfet debt per inhabi-
tant, with the biggest expenditure per inhabi-
tant, and with a record bf 11 successive big
deficits, deliberately created by the luxury of
low taxation. His claim on the imagination of
politicians outside his own domain is based
on the fact that fie led the way as regards
the new immigration and loan policy, and
thus gave men who didn’t like to lead an
excuse to follow. That he is no mean size
in heroes may be seen from an outburst in
the S. M. Herald (4/6/’23) entitled “A
Real Land Policy,” which included the fol-
lowing :
The Premier of Westralia has become a notable
figure in Australian politics, and it will not be sur-
prising if in years to come the Commonwealth
should owe him a good deal more than it does
already He led the way in assisted settlement of
British immigrants on the land with a scheme which
both Victoria and N. S. Wales hastened to emulate.
Every State Premier cocked an ear when word began
to come through of the Westralian plan which Mr.
James Mitcheia was carrying through in London
Mr. Mitchell's plan is not simply to ladle out loan
money. While part of the loan money is being
applied to the work of immigrant group-farming
settlements, a larger part is to be loaned out to
established wheat-farmers (having already at least
600 acres under crop) on condition that they use
it to bring under cultivation a specified further
acreage in the coming season. Mr. Mitchell says:
“We have a belt of 20,000,000 acres in which the
yearlv rainfall is up to 40 inches. Over the whole
of this we can grow two crops, and on the greater
part of it three crops in the year.”
Viewed as a reincarnated Loan-MosES, come
to lead the people a second time into a land
flowing with borrowed milk and honey, Mit-
chell is interesting. Westralia certainly
has a big area where the rainfall is “up to”
40 inches per annum. To be accurate, it
has 26;000,000 acres with a rainfall of over
30 inches, and a small part of this attains
to over 40 inches., Other States have the
same in these proportions:—
Over 40 Inches of Rain.
Sq. Miles. Sq. Miles.
Queensland .. 95,002 Tasmania .. 10,101
N. Territory .. 46,730 Westralia .. 3,376
N. S. Wales .. 22,566 S. Australia .. 64
Victoria .. 12,000
There is nothing in these figures to build a
sudden and tremendous loan boom on. There
is no evidence, to begin with, that the West-
ralian watered area will yield three, or even
two, crops a year any more than the similar
lands of the other States do. Certainly the
Westralian land hasn’t done so yet; indeed,
its wheat yield—and it grows hardly any-
thing else —has been below the Common-
wealth average for eight years out of the
last nine. Premier Mitchell’s brilliant
idea is not to find out why the local wheat
crop is so consistently poor, nor to see if
some little diversity of agriculture might
help, but to- lend money liberally to farmers
provided they will dash in more wheat, —
for one year, anyhow. Westralia’s situation
can be put in a handful of words. It is
desperately short of factories, as evidenced
by Mitchell himself, with his wail about
how the local gold goes east to pay for manu-
factured goods and never returns. But as
Mitchell apparently doesn’t know how to
make a boom in private manufacturing—■
which isn’t a matter of going deeper into the
eternal bog of debt, but of organisation and
intelligence —he strikes a dashing attitude
as the Wizard of the West, playing the old
loan tune with variations. There is no sal-
vation that way. It will add little or nothing
to the permanent wheat yield of the State.
On the contrary, it will pile up debt on the
land that is or might be used for agricul-
ture ; and there is no greater drag on agri-
cultural production in Australia than that
to-day—debt and the inflated capital values
which are the product of loans.
The Tariff Board.
That interesting experiment, the Tariff
Board, will have to be watched carefully,
otherwise we may presently discover that,
instead of being merely a body employed to
see that the policy laid down by Parliament
is not defeated by accidents and anomalies,
it has established itself as a body which lays
down principles and creates anomalies of its
own. A case which strongly suggests that
there is a danger of this is at present having
the attention of Thompson’s, the Castle-
maine engineering firm. In 1921 these people
took over the manufacture of certain water-
tube boilers from Hawke and Co., of South
Aus., and, having spent money on new plant,
apnlied for a duty, which was duly granted
under section 178 (c) of the Tariff in Sep-
tember, 1921. Through this protection
Thompson’s expanded their business and
provided employment for expert workmen.
Everything went smoothly until November,
1922, when the firm learnt to its amazement
that the duty had been withdrawn in favor
of a British firm of boilermakers, who had
promised to establish an engineering shop
in the Commonwealth on the understanding
that their own “headers,” made in Britain
under inferior industrial conditions, should
be admitted duty free, Thompson’s were
naturally perturbed, because this surprising
benevolence meant ruin to a growing branch
of their industry and the inactivity of the
plant, as well as of the men who had been
trained for the job. Thompson’s protested
to the Bruce-Page Government, but all they
got in return was a reply to the effect that
their headers were not satisfactory and were
not acceptable to the Brit'sh Board of Trade,
though what the British Board of Trade had
to do with the matter only the Tariff Board
knows. Anyhow, if the Board of Trade has
a test for the boilers it cannot be more exact-
ing than that of the Commonwealth Naval
Dockyards at Cockatoo Island, _ where
Thompson headers have been submitted to
a steam pressure eight or nine times greater
than would be experienced in warships under
war conditions. The reply apparently bereft
the Tariff Board of further persiflage re-
garding the Board of Trade, for when
Thompson’s deputationed the Customs Min-
ister the other day, one of the Tariff experts
could only suggest to the Minister to see the
British people’s works before giving a de-
cision. But what has that got to do with
the case either? The position is quite simple.
Having been granted certain protection, an
Australian firm established works and
trained men to use them. Now, in order to
secure certain other works,, the Tariff Board
has swept , away the tariff protection on
which the 1 first \Vorks were built. It would
be hard to conceive. of a policy less calcu-
lated to insnire confidence ana better, calcu-
lated to defeat the object of the .Tariff. ,
Bruce and Sugar.
The three years’ .agreement by virtue ,of
which the. price of raw cane-sugar was fixed
at £3O 6s. Sd,-per ton expires this month.
When in Brisbane last week the Priminister
repeated the announcement “made during the
eb-etions and since” (it certainly wasn’t
made by the man who was Priminister dur-
ing the elections) that it would not be re-
newed. He offered, however, to prohibit the
, importation of black-grown sugar for another
two years on the following conditions :-
(1) The formation of a pool “free from control
by the Commonwealth Government.” Apparently
there is; nothing to prevent the State Government
coming in, as at present.
(2) Itaw sugar to be £27 a ton in 1923-24 and
less (but not more) than that in 1924-25 if “a
tribunal” so determines. The tribunal (composition
unspecified) is to “ascertain the cost of efficient
production in reasonably good districts” and con-
sider whether wages are, or are not, excessive.
(3) The manufacturer of goods for export to get
sugar at world’s-parity rates.
(4) The same engaged in the home trade to have
a reduction of £5 a ton.
(5) A halfpenny per pound to be knocked off the
retail price.
(6) The public to get the benefit of any reduc-
tion in the cost of refining and distribution. In
which connection new agreements, subject to the
Commonwealth Government’s approval, are to be
made with the Colonial Sugar and Millaquin cos.
The scheme is attractive in some respects,
but more information is needed as to the
tribunal which is to fix the price of raw
sugar. If the Government suggests the
Tariff Board, the growers will clamorously,
and not unreasonably, object. In reporting
against their application for a duty of £l4
a ton the Board used language which dis-
qualifies it from acting as a price-fixing
body. Among other things it inquired, “Is.
no heed to be paid to the righteous cry from
the hundreds of thousands of industrialists
for reduced costs of living?” Satisfied on.
this point, the growers will probably be
willing to accept the arrangement, especially
if they can get. a promise that if it works

The Chance for the Last Great
Explorer.
Solomon Malapkop” gives an explorer a
send-off:—
Roald Amundsen, the Norseman, was the first
man, save possibly bears and Eskimo, to struggle
through the North-West Passage, and he was the
first, not even excepting bears and Eskimo, to
attain the South Pole. If he reaches the North
Pole I believe he will be the first man there also.
Cook, the allegedly Hebraic American doctor, said
he got there without witnesses, but was blown
out as an impostor. This led to an investigation
ot his previous claim to have reached the top of
Mount St. Elias, also without witnesses, and that
was discredited too. So Cook was unanimously
made an ex-member of the Explorers’ Club. Then
Pf.ary, also an American, came back saying that
he had found the North Pole, and he being a sort
of rational hero his claim was accepted by his
countrymen, and then by the rest of the world
pretty generally. Peary had seven failures on his
record He almost had to find the Pole when he
uul, for he was close to the a ge limit for Arctic
wanderers. Having made up his mind he announced
before leaving 0 n his final voyage that he would
succeed this time, and even fixed the month for the
success. Then lie disencumbered himself of his
only scientific witness, who was also his only white
companion, by the simple process of ordering him
to remain behind, and started on his last lap. He
was back in an amazingly short space of time
saying that the Pole was found. The reason assigned
tor leaving his companion, an Englishman, behind
was the rather mean one that he wanted no one
to share the glory. Some people soon began to
wonder it there was any glory to share. However,
his countrymen wanted to secure the credit of
one big discovery before everything was discovered,
ami to have one name to put alongside those of
Columbus, Diaz, Polo, Torres, Magellan, Tasman,
Vasco da Gama and the other perambulating
immortals. So they clutched at Peary as a drown-
ing man does at a straw. He was made an Admiral
m the prevailing excitement. And the things he
said about Cook were as bad as those one N. S.
W ales Laboi ite uses about another when he finds
that the ballot-box has four sliding sides and a
false bottom.
Amundsen makes his approach to the Pole by
air. which seems the correct way. The surface
attack is too slow, and despite one possible success
in two or three centuries it holds out no hope of
a steady stream of traffic. The idea of approaching
under the ice by submarine has too many draw-
backs, and they are gruesome drawbacks."
When ingenious men have perfected the helicop-
ter- the airship which is to rise perpendicularly,
and hover like a bird or else remain stationary
m the atmosphere work might be commenced with
a view to keeping the more important Polar chan-
nels open for navigation, if the summer ice, which
is the accumulation of all the ages, was cleared away,
then it would be mereh a question of maintaining
a sufficient patrol of ice-breakers to prevent the
autumn ice from getting hold again. Some such
patrol was being developed in the Baltic and the
White Sea before civilisation left off thereabouts,
the basis of my idea is that teams of four helicop-
ters should go out, each team supporting a burning
glass, of abnormal dimensions. The blaze of heat
irom these applied in the early summer when the
ice is weakest would extend the natural break-up
into regions where the iee-eake is usually permanent,
and would ringbark and set adrift icebergs which
weren’t in the programme. It would be a work
of time, like the removal of a jungle, but some-
thing (much or little) would be g*ained everv year,
and it is possible that the ice-fortress, not built
to resist this style of attack, would crumble suddenly
in the end. Man has done something at removing
rivers and deserts and mountains, and he can remove
iee if he only sets his mind to it. Thereby he may
retrieve a lost continent and the world’s biggest
island (Greenland), at least sufficiently for summer
use. The scientific possibilities are dazzling.
The Last Great Explorer should be consulted about
this matter, if he survives sufficiently to be con-
sulted about anything. An eminent predecessor, the
unpronounceable Swedish gentleman with the balloon,
didn’t survive. He wasn’t even accounted for.
The Law as to Deportation.
“J.8.D.” on some legal and other aspects of
Deportation :—■
Father O’Flanagan and his colleague came here
chiefly, no doubt, to create trouble ; but they could not
have imagined their mission would achieve the startling
success it has. The law constituting the Federal
Board before which they appeared last week is one
of our heritages from the War Precautions Act. It
says, inter alia, that anyone not born in the Com-
monwealth, and resident therein for less than three
years, may be deported on the report of persons
appointed by the Minister if shown to have done
certain scheduled things. Most of the offences
created by this measure are unknown to English
law. For example, the one with which O’Flanagan
and O’Kellt were charged —“to advocate the over-
throw of the Government of any civilised country.”
Under this provision a speaker or writer might be
deported for speaking against the Soviet Govern-
ment of Russia. The sole requirement is a com-
plaisant Board—the sort of Board which, under such
circumstances, always is appointed. The Board chosen
to report on the envoys (who, since their arrival
have associated mainly with Communists) consisted
of a former S.M. and Comptroller of Prisons *he
vice-president of an organisation which had already
called on the Minister to “deal with” the accused,
and a Sydney barrister who was once defeated for
a State seat by a Laborite. All good men, of
course, just as General Ryrie, who believes in “de-
porting people first and trying them afterwards,” is
a good man ; but unlikely to bring a judicial mind
to an inquiry involving confessed Republicans. Why
it is necessary that the personnel of this kind of
tiibunal, if it is to function at all, should be as
far above suspicion of partiality as a High Court
Judge lies in the fact that it is as irresponsible
as a war-time censor: it is not answerable to Par-
liament ; it has no permanency; it is not even
sworn.
We want to forget the uncouth manners of the
envoys, and their insults and sneers at our institu-
tions and officials, and only remember that what
Nationalism is doing to them in all good faith to-
day, Labor may be doing, also in good faith, to
somebody else to-morrow. All the next Federal
Labor administration need do if it wishes to make
Australia safe for Communism to the extent of
effectually silencing Communism’s critics is to extend
the index and residential limit of the Hughes mea-
sure. A Labor Government might conscientiously
make it an offence punishable by deportation to advo-
cate lowered wages or lengthened hours of labor
or militarism or navalism. And the Act might with
equal ease and plausibility be made to rope in all
those who had ever acted detrimentally to the Labor
movement. An ex-Minister might be deported for
having supported conscription, or a High Court
Judge for having interpreted the Constitution on
anti-Labor lines. The fate of the accused would be a
foregone conclusion if only because the Board would
be appointed ad hoe', its members might, probably
would, be honest and sincere mpn, but they would
be men of known views'—say, Messrs. Garden,
AT THE BANK OF AUSTRALIA.
THE LEDGER-KEEPER : “Denison Miller’s account? Oh, that’s all right. There’s a big
balance here to his credit.”
Willis and Grant. Dicey' remarks (“The Law of
the Constitution”) :
During the 18th century many of the Continental
Governments were far from oppressive, but there
was no Continental country where men were secure
from arbitrary power. The singularity of England
was not so much the goodness or the leniency as
the legality of the English system of government.
When Voltaire came to England—and Voltaire
represented the feeling of his age—his predominant
sentiment clearly was that he had passed out of
the realm of despotism to a land where the laws
might be harsh, but where men ay ere ruled by law
and not by caprice. He had good reason to know
the difference. In 1717 Voltaire was sent to the
Bastille for a poem which he had not written, of
which he did not know the author, and with the sen-
timents of which he did not agree.
The proceedings before the Board were responsible
for the violation of a constitutional principle of
even greater importance than that which is violated
by the Act responsible for the Board. In civil causes
discovery can be got by either party ; but in crim-
inal ones it is a fundamental rule that neither side
shall be forced to disclose its case or any part of
it. This rule is at the basis of the whole of pur
criminal procedure. The Board was appointed to
deal with O’Flanagan and O’Kelly at a time when
they were awaiting trial on a eharge of sedition,
and much of the Crown evidence in both matters
was necessarily identical. In other words, the
accused were given the option of declining to give
evidence (with the result that they would be de-
ported on the uncontradicted statements of the
Crown) or of giving evidence capable of being used
against them in the sedition trial. If persons in
such a situation, having defended themselves on the
deportation issue, decided to go into the box in
the Criminal Court, they would be cross-examined
on what they had said before the Board: if they
kept out of the box (by which manoeuvre the lowest
malefactor is able to escape having his past gone
into), the prosecution would be entitled to put in
as evidence whatever they might have said before
the Board.
Principles are involved here which go deeper than
the personal rights of a couple of wandering Hiber-
nians—deeper, for that matter, than the rights of
all the Irishmen who may ever leave Ireland. While
this Board was operating in Sydney, the House of
Lords, whose members include the supreme judicial
authority of the British Empire, was unanimously
passing the following noble resolution: “’We affirm
the long-established principle of the Constitution
that the Executive should not, without the previous
special authority of Parliament, exercise the power
of arrest without bringing to trial by due process
of law.” If the measure which W. M. Hushes was
able to impose on his following is left on the
Statute Book, it means that, so far as Australia is
concerned, the whole splendid edifice of checks and
counter-checks against tyranny and political caprice,
built up b} r the subtlest and most elevated minds of
the race during the past four centuries, is doomed.
We are back to the despotism of early Tudor times,
with the additional disadvantage, from the standpoint
of those who fear civil war, that the tyrant is not
stabilised; he may be a Tory Kaiser to-day and a
Labor one to-morrow.
Prohibition and Grape-growing.
A prohibitionist put it this way in the
S. M. Herald the other morning j—-
the transition from “wet” to “dry” in U.S.A.
has not only not damaged but has greatly benefited
the grapegrawers. The latest official report' from
the California Department of Agriculture states:
In 1921 there was apprehension because of the
extensive acreage being- planted,” and that “this
condition continues to exist.” After two or three
years of prohibition, mind you, and with the hun-
dreds of huge local wine distilleries closed down.
But instead, tens of thousands of carloads of fresh
grapes are being distributed all over the States.
Then as to prices. The secretary of Fresno County
Chamber of Commerce recently furnished official
information that “prices for grapes, raisin, table
and wine, have increased very materially over
1914. In 1920 prices were, 300 per cent, higher
than in 1914. In the pre-prohibition days growers
received about 10 dollars per ton in the field. In
1920 they received as high as 120 dollars per ton
f.o.b. cars at point of shipment."
Also, “the transition from ‘wet’ to ‘dry’ has not
only not damaged but has greatly benefited’’
certain whisky retailers; many a man is
making 120 dollars for a consignment of
whisky which in pre-prohibition days brought
him in but 10 dollars. The kind of thing
that is happening in California under the
\ olstead Amendment is illustrated by one of
the advertising circulars of the Co-operative
Fruit Corporation, winch is among the great
business concerns of California: —
Do you make grape juice?
The Government allows you to make 200 gallons
a year without tax. The Zinfandel wine grape is
the grape that was formerly used to make the
famous fancy wines that came from California.
Zinfandels are the only grape that should be used
in making “non-intoxicating juice.” If you have
not manufactured “non-intoxicating juice” order
251 b. of Zinfandels and begin. But remember —if
you are not careful it will ferment, and then the
remit will be Burgundy type wine, which is against
the 18th amendment.
n., ,w,f. or^ OD u i mo . meilt this unsophisticated
P, p r doubt that the Co-operative Fruit
nP!c Pola u lon 1S duite sincere in its desire that
those who pay 15 dollars per case for its
R lX l e ? rape ® not make wine of them.
at r t P e . l ess scrupulous corporations
w ich say Irankly to their customers: “Here
{. e . w ‘ue grapes—at a price 300 per cent,
lgher than we charged in 1014. The in-
ciease is a matter of recompensing us for
out lacerated consciences. Of course you
mean to let our wares ferment and so get a
rsuigundy type wine,’ and of course we
tnow it. Don’t blame us because you are
compelled if you want wine, to drink home-
made pink-eye’ at an exorbitant price;
blame the legislators who saddled the ISth
amendment on you.” On these lines there is
° ij j eas t doubt that Australian vignerons
could do extremely well out of prohibition,
out it is not a legitimate trade any more
than whisky bootlegging is. And, after all,
the average business man would rather make
a reasonable profit on dedent lines than an
unreasonable one by other means. That
common trait in human nature is the chief
explanation of the fact that usury never has
been regarded as a polite profession in Brit-
ish communities.
o»\e of the Bbuce-Page Government’s happy
thoughts is a loan of £3,500,000 for post-
office improvements. The position is that
Pnrw',PP r 11 ment earns a profit of about
tl.-Uu.OOO a year, but, as this is spent on
tads and extravagances elsewhere, £802,700
ot loan money was put into the business last
year to arrest the general decay. It no more
arrested the decay than it did the • horrid
Hornsby homicide. It is possibly irrelevant,
but if the figures on page 621 of the Federal
*’ O P K don’t lie the number of post
offices and receiving offices which the depart-
ment maintained for the accommodation of
the whole Commonwealth was as follows:
1916 .. 8565 1919 .. 8334
1917 .. 8483 1920 .. 8292
1918 .. 8398 1921 .. 8369
hether 196 post offices fell down or became
superfluous through people moving to the
city and the towns shutting up doesn’t appear.
In the same five years the number of em-
S/V7 ee o mail contractors diminished by
io-'/uinS 1, . as already mentioned, a loan of
±.j,oUO,OUO is proposed to rehabilitate this
rich department which is apparently in
danger of dying out, and it is earnestly
hoped the amount will at least prevent it
losing any more ground.
11.L.N.” : The deliberate methods of Gov-
ernment Departments give rise to the idea
that oil of some sort is needed to make the
machinery work smoothly and fast. At any
rate, there is certainly an impression in the
public mind that the right way to push any
business of importance through a Lands De-
partment is to present somebody with a sum
of money. The slick land-agent ‘ sees the
advantage of fostering that impression. His
client is informed in non-committal terms
that it may be necessary to spend a few
pounds, or a few hundred pounds, according
to the magnitude of the interests involved,
m placating some unspecified person who can
piess the button that makes the figure work.
Ihe upshot is that the agent collects the
spoils and lets loose upon the country an-
other convert to the theory of official corrup-
tion There are, of cours'e, land-agents who
are honest; and these serve a useful pur-
pose m passing their clients’ business through
the processes of an official routine revolving
round a complicated code of laws. But it
will hardly be contended that all land-agents
are above reproach, any more than that all
solicitors are. The black sheep among the
latter, however, are restrained by the know-
ledge that if they fall much below the con-
ventional standard of decent practice they
run the risk of being struck off the rolls,
there is no similar restraining influence in
the case of land-agents. And there should be,

mittee which inspected the laboratory at
Geneva, and which went no farther than to
declare that the results of the work were en-
couraging. When negotiations with the Com-
monwealth were in train, Spahlinger re-
fused to'send enough serum to treat 50 inocu-
lated guinea-pigs and broke off further parley
declaring that the experimental stage had’
been passed. He wanted thousands in easli for
the Australian rights and a 20 per eent
royalty on all manufactured serum, though
previously he had deprecated the idea of
manufacturing in Australia. Meantime how-
ever, the British Red Cross had become finan-
cially interested—which seems to have made
a difference. Dr. Mackeddie, of Melbourne
described the inventor as almost starving
from neglect; but the Commonwealth experf-
ence suggests that he has a remarkably keen
commercial sense. His claims as a 'world-
benefactor have yet to be established.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A majority of the State Governments
having accepted it, the Bruce-Pages aie
going ahead with their stopgap scheme for
cutting up the income-tax between the
two taxing authorities. In reply to
Cocks, the N.S.W. Treasurer, who stuck
out to the last, Bruce said that the only
alternative to his proposals was that the
Commonwealth should take over the whole
field of income-taxation. As a matter ol
fact, that —meaning one tax instead of seven
and one department instead of six—is the
only permanent and satisfactory solution oi
the problem.
The trouble with these Premiers’ Confer-
ences is that if they settle anything it must
be so easily settled that it could be done
without a conference. The best they can do
is to arrange details of a scheme already
agreed to. There was general agreement
that one set of income-tax returns should
suffice. It might then have been possible to
cut up the tax between the Commonwealth
and the States if the Federal Government
had prepared data about which there was
no question. But it did nothing of the sort.
In N. S. Wales, for instance, the ravenous
State takes 2s. 6d. in the £ of cos.’ dividends,
and the Commonwealth bites 2s. sd. m the
£ out of the undivided profits. On the
assumption that the undivided profits are
about half of the total profits the Prime
Minister proposed that the Commonwealth
should take the State’s old 2s. 6d., while
the State should be entitled to Is. 3d. ol
the profits—this, it was suggested,. would
leave the taxation of cos. where it is now.
But far more than half of the profits are
divided; it is doubtful whether 20 p.c. re-
mains undistributed. So the scheme pro-
vided for a heavy increase of company taxa-
tion; and the cos. that would suffer most are
the young and small ones that have difficulty
in giving their shareholders a fair return,
and therefore have been paying very little
undistributed-profits tax. The present sys-
tem is bad ; that the attempt to supersede it
has so far failed is due chiefly to the Prime
Minister going into the conference with a
half-baked substitute.
In some respects the Bruee-Page plan for
simplifying the income-tax business will
make confusion worse confounded. There is
the puzzle of what is to be done with the
fairly numerous class of persons who draw
incomes from more than one State. For
instance, a man with two or three houses
in different State capitals has to pay the
Commonwealth Commissioner a high rate of
tax on his aggregate rents, but under the
“simplified” system he may conceivably be
exempt. This is one of the matters that have
been formally reserved for adjustment, but
it will take a lot of adjusting. Again, the
State income-tax in Westralia is collected by
Commonwealth officers, the Federal and
State departments having amalgamated a
year or two ago. If the Bruce-Page pro-
posals go through Parliament, the Westra-
lian Government will have to assume control
of the Federal tax-gatherers, or nearly all of
them, and that will set up complications
under Littleton Groom’s Superannuation
Act passed last year, but retroactive to 1920.
It may be taken for granted that, in view
of the enormous growth of the Common-
wealth Bank, no one man will again be
given absolute power over it. The real ques-
tion is as to the composition of the Board:
should it be composed of men with outside
interests, or of officers of the bank? Cer-
tainly some very valuable men could be got
from outside. John Garvan, of the M.L.C.,
is the man most often mentioned. But it
will be noted that in John Garvan’s own
great insurance concern the Board consists
almost wholly of men who have been trained
in the service of the co., and who still hold
salaried office in it. This plan has the advan-
tage of keeping the politician out; and it
seems to be the only one that will. It would
have been unbelievable 20 years ago that a
politician would be made a Railway Com-
missioner to reward him for life-long ser-
vice to a party; and yet, with the job avail-
able to men from outside, even that happened
in N. S. Wales.
SECOND FIDDLE.
“Mr Bruce still refuses to see any logic in the suggestion that Dr. Earle Page should be Acting Prime
Minister and leader of the House while he is away at the Imperial Conference."
BRUCE : “I’m the loud noise in this orchestra, my lad, and you’re permanent second-
fiddle; and I’m taking my music with me in case you feel ambitious.”
The New State Convention at Armidale
(N.S.W.) came to one definite conclusion.
A clause in the Federal Constitution makes
the consent of a State Parliament necessary
before anv district which is utterly dissatis-
fied with 'that Parliament can set up for it-
self ; and the Convention says that the clause
must go out. It was one of two which the
calamitous George Reid got smuggled into
the Constitution without the consent of the
people’s Convention; and if it goes out the
excision will be really a compliment to Bar-
ton, Kingston, Deakin, O’Connor, Downer
and the other great framers of the document.
It won’t be to George Reid; but, then, his
capacity for doing the wrong and ungenerous
thing amounted to genius.
Prime Minister Bruce has defined his posi-
tion on the question of Australia’s represen-
tation in the councils of the Empire. He
“will decline to accept responsibility on the
part of Australia for any policy that, we
have not a voice in determining.” It is a
just and honest proposition, but if the Em-
pire drifts into war we will be in it all
the same, unless we get out of the Empire,
and persuade its enemies to recognise the
fact that we are out. Then, unless Aus-
tralia has a much larger and better diffused
population than at present, and is armed to
the teeth, it may promptly find itself inside
some other empire—probably a worse one.
There aren’t many empires for _us to choose
from, just as Jonah had a limited selection
of whales.
From a man in the Gallery :
If all the rumors of uproar take shape, Bruce
will have a lively session. The undiplomatic row
with the Returned Soldiers’ League, which seems
to grow more embittered the more Senator Wilson
explains, is bound to be exploited for party pur-
poses, and a judiciously worded motion launched
while the subject is yet hot will put the Diggers
behind Bruce in an embarrassing position. There
is further matter for an explosion in the reversals
of fiscal form by the Customs Department, even
Harry Gregory, a convinced Freetrader, publishing
a shout on the temporary suspensions of duty at
the will of the Tariff Board. This subject will
inevitably be ventilated, and the noise of the Pro-
tectionists, fearing a weakening of the Govern-
ment’s attitude on the fiscal policy of the country,
will add considerably to the confusion. Finally
there is Bruce’s own suggestion to shut up Parlia-
ment when he goes to England. On this point he
may in the end agree to let Parliament carry on
with Page in command, on the understanding that
the Nationalists and Farmers guarantee the Gov-
ernment a safe passage while he is away in Eng-
land.
It is Queensland’s policy under Theodore
to lease land to settlers, but not sell it. It
is also the policy in the Northern Territory,
but the system doesn’t seem to have promoted
much settlement. In Denmark, on the other
hand, the farmer is mostly a freeholder, with
just enough restrictions on land sales to pre-
vent the accumulation of big estates; and
Denmark leads the world in agriculture. In
his Burnett scheme, Theodore says he has
devised a lease which will be practically per-
petual, and the rent is to be a mere trifle.
Maoriland also once had a crank Minister
who devised a 999 years’ lease without right
of renewal; but it was soon discovered to
be a magnificent device for tying up estates.
Maoriland, therefore, stopped granting those
leases after 15 years, and almost implored
the leaseholder to buy. And the leaseholder
who hadn’t been able to get a decent develop-
ment loan on his “spotted title ” mostly did
buy. The “perpetual system” hadn’t suited
him either. In fact, it hadn’t suited anybody.
“H. Horsecollar” writes with unusual calm :
That passionate pilgrim, Premier Mitchell of West-
ralia, got so far as to say that it was “a miserable,
paltry and damnable thing that people should hesitate
to link up East and West with a proper railway.” It
might be added that it is damnable i hat people
should hesitate to link up North and South with any
railway at all, more especially as the line is a statu-
tory obligation and has been paid for with an im-
mense land grant. Also, words fail to describe the
bounding and blastiferous cheek of a Premier who
goes on like this when one reason why the East-West
line is not so proper and uniform as it might be 1*
that his lightly-taxed State won’t honor its promise
to change its section thereof (Kalgoorlie to Perth)
to the standard gauge.
It will be 32 years on June IT since the
election of the first Labor members—3o
all told—to N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly.
“Lexite” : Some of the N. S. Wales Com-
munists are so tricky that they couldn t help
intriguing with both Dooleyites and anti-
Dooleyites during the A.L.P. conference.
Also, trickiness was exhibited in the man-
oeuvres that preceded their formal reception
(so far as the present conference can receive
them) into “the movement.” On a presidential
ruling that a delegate with two bona-hde
badges might register two votes, a number
of anti-Communists left their proxies with
colleagues and were absent from the fateful
sitting. Mustering their full strength the
Communists had the ruling upset, but even
then they failed to secure a majority for the
admission of their white-anting faction, ihe
voting was 122 all. In such cases the rule
is that the chairman’s vote goes to maintain
the existing order of things.. Lut W Ah B !
defiant of precedent, threw his vote to. the
Communists. Willis protests that he isn t
Red—merely pale pink.
Before Labor can hope to get into power
in Vic. State politics it will have to add lo
seats to its present 21. How it is going
to manage the job nobody knows, but it is
talking of sending a delegation to Queens-
land to pick up some wrinkles. Seats are
to be redistributed in Vic., but the recast
will not benefit Labor; and the Cocky. party
shows uo inclination to become a joint in
the tail of Prendergast’s dog.
From another Trades Hall table: —
Bailey, M.L.A., losing his grip on the “move-
ment” he has controlled so long, was an interest-
ing spectacle at N. S. Wales Labor Conference.
Dispassionately and impressively he denied the allega-
tions of men who obviously feared him even while
they denounced; denied them in much more digni-
fied fashion than the late St. Peter. No one knew
better than Bailey that he was a gone coon, but
not for a moment did his demeanor suggest it.
When the air was clamorous with denunciations
of him he never moved from his seat, but scarcely
a minute went by without some ardent and humble
follower approaching and whispering information.
A curt order or a swift decision on the position
reported, and the devotee would slink back to his
seat. Bailey will go down to Labor history as Bailey
the Mayor-maker, but not as Bailey .the Premier-
maker. Put it to his credit that he fought for
his frowsy cause till the last. McGirr ran away.
The melancholy Premier Mitchell of West-
ralia foresees -more .Federal andrrect-taxa-
tion, which, he says, will hit Westralia
very hard because “it is not a manufactu-
ring State.” Well, it is Mitchell’s job to
improve things, and not sob. One hin-
drance is that the Westralian factory-and
insists on extra wages in memory of the
gold days. In 1922 he got £l9 a year
more than the Victorian, though. Perth-
Fremantle was the capital where rent was
lowest, and food prices weren’t unusual.
Then when one divides the “value added in
process of manufacture” by the number of
factory-’ands who produce the value, it
really seems that the highly-paid Westralian
is either languid or badly directed. In
1921 (there seems to be a delay about the
1922 figures) his output was worth about
£35 per year less than the average. As
unemployment was below the average a
suspicion exists that Premier Mitchell may
be beguiling the populace away from the
looms and forges with the offer of loan
jobs. All these matters, however, are the
•Big-Debt State’s own affair. . They are
only mentioned because Mr. Mitchell seems
to have a grievance against the East because
of them, and tends to weep on the East’s
shirt-front in consequence. And shirt-fronts
cost something these days.
Of the latest European revolution: —
Constitutionalists will not lose any sleep over the
misfortunes of the ex-Prime Minister of Bulgaria.
Stambouliski was a Balkans Mussolini. Like the
present dictator of Italy he began the war as a
pacifist and anti-monarchist. He acquired
power, shortly after emerging from prison,
by the familiar device of putting the whole
blame of the war on the Opposition. His next step
was to exile or imprison his more formidable politi-
cal opponents, and punish minor critics on sedition
charges. At the recent general elections he won
205 seats out of 246, partly by politically demobil-
ising practically the whole of the Opposition and
partly by promising the peasants the property of
their radical and bourgeois enemies. Unlike Lenin
and Mussolini, he made the fatal error of retaining
certain pacifist leanings after he attained power,
and it is evidently the army that has overthrown
him. A significant feature of the business is the
ahsurd position occupied by King Boris. The
allegedly “loyal” revolutionaries are treating him
like an old servant who has ceased to be useful, but
may expect to keep his job so long as he shows
deference and obedience to his masters, the political
bosses.
THE CROOKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It has transpired that the [late] Labor execu-
tive knew that there were fraudulent ballot-boxes in
the A.L.P. rooms, and that it tried to hush the
matter up and keep it from Conference.” — Worker.
Are the boxes in position? Nothing to excite
suspicion
That there’s anything about them “crook” or
“snide”?
Never avenues or channels for disclosure that the
panels,
The moment that a spring is pressed, will slide ?
Has the question who’s elected —or shall be —and
who rejected
Been settled by the arbiters who fill
ROles of cherubs perched above you? Come along,
then, dupes, Lord love you!
And proceed to cast your votes for —whom you
will.
Are the pence-cards in their places—like the bowers
and the aces
In the sleeves of unforgettable Ah Sin?
Are the rolls, with purpose reasoned, adequately
stuffed and seasoned?
Then the hour has come for polling to begin.
Make your votes emphatic voices, comrades, to con-
vey your choices,
Men you’ll have for you in Parliament to strike.
Shove your papers in the boxes. Populi vox Dei
vox is.
You may pick to represent you—whom you like.
Other parties choose their champions, from the
Leeuw'in to the Grampians,
By methods that democracy would kill.
Wealth and influence are factors to determine who’-ll
be actors.
Labor only seeks to find the People’s Will
Vests alone in the majority unreserved, supreme
authority
As its rightful and inalienable due.
To that faith we’ll aye be steady. Are the “onkus”
boxes ready?
Right! Then faites votre jeu, companeros, jaites
votre jeu.

When the B.N.S.W. balanced in September
last a few of the sources of exceptional earn-
ings were running less freely, so profits were
smaller than for the preceding four terms.
There was also doubt as to how the Com-
monwealth would fare with its wool, wheat
and other staples, while the industrial out-
look was not over-bright. But most of the
clouds cleared rapidly ; during the past half
world’s markets have been favorable, par-
ticularly for wool, which commanded good
prices and brought prompt settlements. This
industry, so far as markets are concerned, is
now well back towards normal, though, of
course, Germany is still a poor buyer.
The Bawra distributions and realisa-
tions of the new clip have helped bank-
ing deposits considerably, and, at the same
time, have eased pressure elsewhere. Other
industries also revived, and generally there
has been renewed activity on a sounder foot-
ing. One way and another, the profit-earn-
ing operations of the banks improved a good
deal in recent months. And that recovery
has been supported by splendid rains, which
have broken ( a drought that threatened to
be one of thd worst the Commonwealth has
experienced.
The Wales’s latest profits are the largest
ever disclosed, though possibly it did earn
more at the height of the importing boom a
couple of years ago. Considerable additional
capital has been got in since then. Just
over three years ago paid capital was four
millions, but shortly after the latest accounts
closed new subscriptions had increased it to
six millions. After payment of the dividend
visible reserves were close on four millions,
so the bank now has more than 10 millions
of its own employed. That, of course, makes
no allowance for internal reserves which
have been piled up in the prosperous periods
of the Wales’s 106 years’ life. The large
reserves are an important factor in dividend-
earning : shareholders’ visible funds have to
show only 6 p.c. net to return 10 p.c. on
capital.
Three years’ balance-sheet figures are
shown in this comparison:—

tomary great strength: total liabilities to

than 54 4 p.c. of all liabilities was in liquid
form. The position now .is snugger,-too, be-
daufee a larger proportion of the deposits are
fixed : in 1914 55 p.c. of deposits in the Com-
monwealth were left w ; th the banks for
definite terms; by 1920 the proportion, had
declmed to 47 p.c., and it has now recovered
to 531 p.c. This is not of so much import-
afice in the B N.S.W. as in many other
banks; the Commonwealth’s b’ggest bank
has always kept its lending operations well
within accepted limits. Almost all the
public’s money at call . is held liquid.

Tlie Metropolitan is now a much more satis-
factory Life office. For years The Bul-
letin appealed to the management to tell more
about operations by publishing the reports
of its actuary; now, at last, it has mended
its ways and let in a little light on its
balance-sheet figures. In its early career
there were some happenings which were not
to the Metropolitan’s credit —for instance,
the divs. paid to shareholders when the con-
cern was domiciled in Brisbane, and, later,
the methods by which a “surplus” was un-
earthed to square-off accounts when Ordi-
nary and Industrial figures were separated.
But that belongs to the dead past; and
Tiie Bulletin is now prepared to forget
all and judge the co. on its present behavior.
For some years the management has been
steadily developing its business on sound
lines: it has not joined in tlie rush for big
figures which could be won only at heavy
cost. Regularly each year it has been roping
in approximately £190,000 of new Ordinary
assurances, and Industrial policies for slightly
less than a half-million. The Ordinary ex-
pense rate last year was 24,4 p.c., slightly
more than in the previous year, but a big
improvement on the 40 p.c. or so of 10
years ago. And the new business, though
not cheap, is not over-expensive. Allowing
7 . p.c. for renewals, last year’s first pre-
miums cost 125 p.c.; or, on the basis that new
business costs 10 times more than old business,
the Metropolitan’s renewals rate was 10.9
p.c. and the first-premiums rate 109 p.c.
Industrial costs at 46.2 p.c. continue to im-
prove : 1911, 66.9 p.c.; 1916, 53.7 p.c.; 1921,
48.8 p.c. Meanwhile, the claims rate in both
departments has been favorable, notwith-
standing the war and ’flu losses since the
last valuation of policies in 1917.
The introductory table shows that Ordi-
nary income has more than doubled in five
years, and that Industrial revenue has me m-
while expanded 74 p.c. Ordinary assurances
have moved as follows : 1912, £276 178 ; 1917.
£423,927; 1922, £887,011. Industrial pre-
miums have grown: 1912, £28,523; 1917,
£50.642 ; 1922, £86,277; and 61.6 p.c. of the
Industrial business is now in respect of
whole-life policies, 38.1 p.c. endowment assur-
ances, and only 0.3 p.c. straight-out endqw-
ments. The Metropolitan has been seeking ,
better-class Industrial business, its propor-
tion of whole-life policies being larger than
in any other Australian office. Meanwhile,
considerable improvement has shown up in
the investments section: a dozen years ago
average funds earned just 3 p.c., and for the
five years ended 1917 3.3 p.c. The average
for the past quinquennium was 4.6 p.c.
The all-round improvement has permitted
consulting-actuary "VV. R. Day to compile a
cheerful little document. But a windfall, in
the form of a profit on old premises sold
to make room for the Government Sawings
Bank,, has enabled him to m%lte a better
showing than ..would otherwise have been the
case. Of the £24,493 profit so derived Mr.
Day took £B5OO for the Ordinary depart-
ment and £12,000- for the Industrial ,to
strengthen valuations. Fifteen years ago the
earning, rate of funds was assumed through-
out at SA.'p.c., but in the next two valuations
some policies were placed on a 4 p.c. basis;
now 3i| p.c. is restored throughout in both
departments. Day Certifies that the £195/ ' 5
funds in the Ordinary branch were £26,633
in excess of his requirements, and he recom-
mends that £18,697 be treated as divisible
profit, £l2OO be set aside to provide for
bonuses on policies becoming claims during
the current quinquennium, and the balance
reserved. The distributable surplus provids
reversionary bonuses for each of the past
five years .at the rate of 20s. to 50s. p.c.
accoi’ding to the life of policies. In the In-
dustrial branch the £164 845' of funds was
£6223 in excess of requirements ; and £2500
of that is taken to (1) relieve policy-holders
of 15 years’ standing of payment of pre-
miums at age SO, and (2) a bonus of 10
p.c. to 15-year-old policies becoming claims
during the current quinquennium. The
balance goes into reserve for future consid-
eration.
These results give the Metropolitan a new
outlook. Of course, shareholders have parti-
cipated in the distribution, but to what ex-
tent the published reports do not disclose,
on this occasion, and probably for the first
time in the co.’s career the distributions were
justified. And if the management continues
to develop the business on a conservative
basis, there is no reason why the Metropoli-
tan should not steadily become stronger and
more prosperous. Even the Accident subsi-
diary—£l6,9o9 is invested there—has become
a div.-payer after a dozen or so years’
struggle. When the co.’s new premises are
completed—it is raising a new pile on the
site long occupied by Norwich Chambers —
the management expects that interest-earn-
ings “will quickly rise to a normal figure.’’
Whether that is a wise investment depends,
of course, on present-day building values and
the demand for city offices being maintained
in the years to come. The balance-sheet
total at December 31 was £380,013, and
£240,000-odd was in Government securities
and cash. Property had a book value of
£79,098, but £16,661 was owing on mort-
gage. Loans on mortgages and policies
totalled £46,845. No doubt, payments dur-
ing the current year on account of the new
premises will considerably alter the balance-
sheet position.

This co. had been in business a quarter of a
century when, in 1920, it became a public co.
and got in £64,000 new capital from an issue
of 8 p.c. prefs. The reconstruction also
placed £6OOO of old prefs. on the same basis
as the new issue. Public interest is practi-
cally confined to the prefs. A lot of the
new capital was raised to finance the erec-
tion of premises, but construction was post-
poned, and the building will not be com-
pleted until early next year. The prefs. are
attractive paper: latest profits, prior to vot-
ing £5OOO to a staff fund, covered div. re-
quirements six times over, and after latest
distributions had been made to shareholders
every £1 of pref. capital had the backing of
net tangible assets with a book value of
almost 525. For old proprietors, Australians’
tea-drinking habits are brewing large pro-
fits : after settling with the prefs., last year’s
profits were equal to 26 p.c. on the £112,731
of ordinary capital. There are 125,257 „£1
ordinaries paid to 18s. The interim div. was
at the rate of 10 p.c. on the amount paid up;
the final 10 p.c. was on the “nominal”
amount of capital, making the year’s return
slightly more than 10| p.c. The co. has done
so well that three years’ surplus profits have
covered all except £17,124 of the £50,139 of
capital represented by goodwill and forma-
tion exes. Balance-sheet figures have moved
in this way :

Liabilities, which include reserves for tax-

favorable markets to buy extensively, and
easier exchange rates also favored longer-

It is unusual for a young insurance co.’s
affairs to be in such a healthy condition as
the Bankers and Traders’. The’ second year
closed on March 31 with a surplus £4112 In.
excess of the customary 40' p.c. provision
for unexpired risks. The performance is the
more; • creditable because all . establishment,
and .organisation expenses from the beginning
liave been charged against revenue. If is the
fashion nowadays for managements of young

Capital is £77,750, in 155,500 £1 shares paid
10 10s. Every penny of funds is in first-class
securities : the £116,488 of assets at March 31
was made up of £50,113 of Government
securities; deposits and cash, £28,641; book
debts and outstanding premiums, £2502;
branch and agency balances, £5141.
Though the surplus of funds in excess of
the provision for unexpued risks is sufficient
to give 5 p.c. on paid capital, a conserva-
tive policy is being persisted in. The
£20,131 at credit in the revenue account is
being split up as follows: unearned pre-
mium reserve, £15,000; general reserve,
£4000; and the balance of £ll3l remains in
Profit and Loss account. The Bankers and
Traders’ has made an excellent start, parti-
cularly considering the difficulties of the
period during which it has been in business:
falling values, diminished trade, high work-
ing costs and abnormally heavy losses.

A little more than two years ago £52,587
was extracted from reserves to make capital
£192,820. Then huge stocks came forward
unexpectedly, overseas manufacturers com-
pleting orders which were held up during
the war years. At March, 1921, goods on
hand and in course of sale under t.-p. con-
tracts Totalled £319,740, and outside liabili-
ties £157,716. On paper, the position was
not healthy; but, unlike other traders who
were caught with heavy stocks on a falling
market, Nicholson’s succeeded in unloading
at good profits. Fortunately, after-war
troubles did not hit the Commonwealth hard,
and the spending capacity of the public was
not curtailed to any extent. So dealers in
pianos and other musical goods were not
forced into cut-throat competition to turn
their stocks into cash to satisfy creditors.
Theirs was one of the few trades which
escaped. During the ‘l\ years this co. has
paid 10 p.c. divs. regularly on its enlarged
capital, and has meanwhile put £5500-odd
into reserve.. The amount tied up in stocks
and goods hired out on purchase-agreements
is still large ; it exceeds paid capital and re-
serves by £48,863. To do this, carry £B3OB of
other book debts, hold property with a book
value of £41,048 and £10,500 of shares in
the Concord Piano Co., and provide work-
ing plant and odds and ends, the co. is neces-
sarily a large borrower. At March 31
£20,036 was owing on overdraft, £81,496 was
due to sundry creditors, and there were other
liabilities of £4524—a total of £105,856.

Immunity from electrolysis is a strong argument
in favor of the use of Pioneer Wood Pipe as water
service mains in towns and cities where electric
tramways or railways are installed. Many cities have
had their water mains destroyed and rendered useless
bv stray electric currents in a very short time.
Metal pipe is crystallised and disintegrated by
electricity speedily, whilst wood pipe, being a non-
conductor, is unaffected. Nor is Pioneer Wood Pipe
rusted or corroded by water, the flow remains con-
stant, unchecked by the incrustation or growths that
so speedily block other types of conduit. The

good divs. are rosy. The co. began at a
favorable time for investing funds: there are
Government securities with a face value of
£l6 528 purchased for £16,451 and earning
from 41 to 6 p.c. Older cos. have securities
on their books carrying as little as 3 p.c. and
they have had to write them down to depre-
ciated market values. Other Bagot assets are :
advances to estates, £1100; cash, etc., £487 ;
furniture £325 (written down from £540).
There were no outside liabilities at the bal-
ancing date. Besides £17,738 of funds pro-
tecting clients, there is £87,000 more call-
able from shareholders.
Profits of Kalgoorlie mines continue to
decline. Mine-managers say that the increase
in miners’ wages is responsible, but they
make no reference to the fact that nearly all
other mining costs have increased in greater
ratio. Several things need explaining in
connection with Kalgoorlie mines. One of
the biggest of them has announced that it
has only six-months’ ore reserves in sight,
and at the same time it is said to be con-
sidering a change-6ver from steam to elec-
tricity in its power plant.
* * * *
The report that the concentration of hold-
ings and the consolidation of labor effort are
being discussed by the big London-controlled
Kalgoorlie cos. has been revived. At present
the Boulder, Horseshoe and Ivanhoe in one
group, and the Lake View, Associated, Per-
severance, South Ivalgurli and Oroya Links
in another, all have separate managements,
separate mills, plants, etc. If they were
worked under a system of concentration of
leases, such as prevails at Johannesburg,
overhead charges could be curtailed and sev-
eral plants scrapped.
* * * *
Ivanhoe (W.A.), with 71,9640 z. from
178,406 tons, won more gold in 1922 than
in any of the three preceding terms. Bul-
lion yielded £331,45(0, *of which £23,641
came from premiums, without which the
co. would just have scraped free of loss. Not
much development was done, but south of the
porphyry bar at 2870 ft. crosscuts from a
winze down 130 ft. proved the east lode there
to be 30ft. wide and to average, where cut,
4s. a ton. Though this may be a compara-
tively rich patch, it was heartening to find
good gold at that depth. Run-of-tlie-mine
stone last year was 395. 11 id. and costs 345.
3-Jd., so John McDermott was battling along
on a very narrow margin. Reserves were
cut into for 107,559 tons last year, and Mc-
Dermott reports 692,000 tons in sight. of an
average grade of 325. lid., which is less
than last year’s average costs.
Years ago Central and West Boulder
worked two leases on the Golden Mile, and
out of one of them —a six-acre block sand-
wiched between the Associated and Lake
View —won a lot of gold. Shareholders, how-
ever, got nothing. When prospects faded the
co. put a caretaker in charge of its Westralian
interests and went to seek its fortune else-
where. Lately it has become interested in
Northern Nigerian tin.
* * * *
8., M. and Co. are inviting tributors to
take a hand in extracting the Bullfinch’s ore
reserves, which could not be made to pay
owing to high costs. Prospects for tribu-
tors do not appear alluring; excepting the
£lOO,OOO worth of 7oz. ore in the original
rich shoot down to 100 ft., the mine has
shown few rich patches. There are some
thousands of tons of lOdwt. ore in the north-
ern lodes, and tributors may make good
wages there.
North Ivalgurli (W.A.) was recently sampled
for London, and local rumor is that, taken
by and large, the show has been proved un-
payable. Vail, manager of the Lake View,
who supervised the sampling, says the report
is misleading, but in what way he doesn t
indicate. Anyway, the mine is only suitable
for tributors who are willing to burrow here,
there and everywhere. Years ago Dr. Mac-
laren, after a thorough geplogieal examina-
tion, advised the Board to continue the tri-
bute system, as deeper sinking was not justi-
fied. * * *
Brown’s Reward (W.A.) has disappointed.
According to manager Ryan, the better-
grade ore has been cutting out, and develop-
ment work has given no promise of improve-
ment. The show is held under option by
Ives Reward Co., which has already allotted
vendor Loftus Connor 40,000 fully-paids, and
£lO,OOO cash was to have been paid if the opt n
was exercised. Manager Ryan has dropped
out, and the directors are giving vendor
Connor an opportunity of deciding whether
the show has gone to pieces.
• * * *
Devon, Linden (W.A.), jogs along on
next to nothing. Seven months ago J.
Leverington told the Board that the mineral-
ised ore had cut out, and that that was
the end. In January D. A. Wilson declared
that ore was still showing, that there were
100 ft. of backs, and that shareholders should
not lose heart. The vital point, though, is
what length of pay-shoot exists; hitherto it
has been so short as to prove the Devon
only a stringer. Wilson claims he can make
the Devon pay, so a call is being made to
give him an opportunity.
London is again debating whether man-
agers of established mines should be judged
by their costs per ton of ore crushed. ‘ Low
costs” and sound management don’t always
go together. They rarely did at Kalgoorlie.
The manager whose cost-sheets showed, say,
30s. per ton took credit to himself over
others whose costs were a shilling or so
more ; but the latter could often have laked
tonnages, troubled less about percentage of
gold left in residues, and suppressed charges,
and shown costs at 30s. or under. In the
long run, shareholders get a better deal from
the manager who gives attention to efficiency
in extraction and recovery rather than to
seeking to show low costs.
Oil-Shale Products and Coal, Ltd., registered
with a nominal capital of £750,000, has
amended its original proposals to modest
dimensions. A new prospectus has been
issued in which the vendors seek £OO,OOO ot
fully-paids and £BOOO cash and invite the
public to subscribe £70,000. Fuller details
are given as to the oil contents of the Joadja
shales, and further information is tendered
regarding prospective reserves around the
leases originally worked by the Australian
Kerosene Oil Co. The new co. proposes to
confine productive operations to this area
and seek a purchaser in England for the
Reedy Creek ground, a few miles away, which
has been proved by Government drill to con-
tain good oil-shale. If the co. can dispose
of this area on favorable terms its position
will be much strengthened. So far as its
own activities are concerned everything will
depend on how actual working operations bear
out estimates. Provided the shales can be
dug out cheaply, and retorting and refining
practice is economical, there are possibili-
ties in the enterprise. The retorting methods
formerly decided upon have been abandoned
for the multi-chambered system, by which
temperatures are controlled to give maxi-
mum recoveries. The feature of the float
is that practically all of the £70,000 which
the public is asked to subscribe will be re-
quired to put the enterprise into work. The
directors are empowered to proceed to allot-
ment when 35,000 shares are taken up, but
that subscription would do little more than
take the enterprise off the hands of the
vendor syndicate, and considerable additional
funds would still be required to provide
treatment plant. Prospects of resurrect-
ing the shale-oil industry on a profitable
basis depend entirely on mining and retort-
ing costs permitting the output to compete
with well-oil, though, later on, when the
world’s gushers begin to fail, the handling
of the Commonwealth’s immense oil-shale
deposits is certain to become a great indus-
try.

Cooper and Nephews, the old sheep-dip
firmware still proceeding on the even tenor of
their way at the Ottery arsenic-mine, Tent
Hill, Emmaville (N.S.W.). Ore values are
being well maintained, and the output is
steady. There are tin values in the ore, and,
as the market for that metal has improved, a
proposal to install tin-winning equipment
has been revived.
* * * *
A syndicate headed by Jack Small, one-
time prospector in Westralia and S’Africa,
is testing a promising line of country near
Yeoval, 23 miles south of Wellington
(N.S.W.). Rich rubble and floaters were
discovered many years ago. but no reef.
Small is now down 30ft. in values all the
Way, and work is proceeding on a 3ft. reef,
on a serpentine-diorite contact, giving 4oz.
values. Meanwhile nannings from eosteens
20 chains along the line - reef have shown
colors.
* * * *
Jim Hardman, for many years associated
with Lyell and Bischoff and manager of
several N. S. Wales mines, has taken charge
of the Yerranderie (N.S.W.) silver-mine.
Former owners took out about £BO,OOO in
divs. before giving up owing to the supposed
exhaustion of reserves. The show was pur-
chased for £1750 by a £6OOO limited-liability
co., and Hardman at once proceeded to win
ore from old workings: in a fortnight 10
tons going about 150 oz. silver and 38 p.c.
lead were won. His probing has revealed
a lot of ground between levels not blocked
out, so there are prospects of profitable re-
turns apart from new developments.
* * * *
“Viking”: Because Bill Cundy. who knows
a lot about Bendigo, says nice things of one
or two of the shows on the northern end of
Walhalla (Vic.), the most is now being
made of every bit of quartz cut. At the
New Long Tunnel, Ilartriek ran into 3ft. of
what he calls “not rich” stuff, still “battery
stone.” That isn’t bad, even for the moun-
tains, but with 3ft. of such stuff to draw
upon and the other makes of quartz of by-
gone days, why should it take months to
get out a crushing fit for the stamps to
play upon? Ilartriek says that it is the
size of the mine that counts, and not merely
a shoot of stone that has to be handled, but
that talk cuts no ice for those who know
the pots of gold that came out of the Long
Tunnel Extended wedge, hemmed in on both
sides by the big Long Tunnel. The old
North spent £lOO,OOO near where Hartrick
roams, and never gave a decent crushing.
Something more than geological optimism is
required to convince me that the present
crowd will win in ground where the old-
timers failed.
* * * *
Another Vic. mountain claim, the Working
Miner, at Ivevington, is ruled out. Down
to No. 3 level the show gave 18dwt. stuff,
but the shoot disappeared, and a plucky
crowd took on the job of driving a long low-
level tunnel on the general course of the for-
mation to see if freSh shoots could be met.
As no luck followed, they have decided to
wind up and sell the assets to a new co. that
wall test the old Wallaby ground, at Gaff-
neys. This field has a better reputation
than Kevington, and the Wallaby should be
worth probing.
R. W. Stringer, representing the Austra-
lian Oil Corporation, is the latest of a long
procession to descend on Beaudesert (Q.),
and it really looks as if something will be
done there to test the supposed oil strata.
Stringer proposes to get a staff on the ground
to drill preliminary holes for ascertaining
the best spot for a deep bore. The trouble
is that the structure cannot be accurately
defined in the country around Dunn’s, as
it is mostly black-soil alluvial. The bottom
of the syncline is likely to be waterlogged,
which means that it is imperative, to have
any chance, that the test-bore should be
well up from the bottom.
Jensen, in his report on the Tewantin area
<Q.), says there is a considerable thickness
of tertiary beds with carbonaceous strata,
and favorably folded for holding oil. It is
speculative, he adds, whether there is
enough oil concentrated in pools to pay, but
he reckons there is a lot of evidence in
favor, and considers boring is warranted
on a new site where there is evidence of anti
clinal structure.
* * * *
The Government drill has made a start on
No. 2 hole near the Rainbow, Charters
Towers (N.Q.). The first bore went down
between 500 ft. and 600 ft. without striking
anything noteworthy. The No. 2 has already
struck an 18in. formation carrying 3in. to
4in. of mineralised quartz showing galena,
and is now down 140 ft. in hard gianite.
The next bore will probably try the deeper
ground on the Wellington J'eef. *
The Waniola, Charters Towers (Q.), has
not fulfilled the hopes originally entertained
that it might help to stop the rot on the old
field. The party working it has shown won-
derful persistence in following the formation
on the underlie to a depth of 185 ft., but to
do this it has had cash assistance from the
Mines Department. At 165 ft. levels have
been opened out, and the formation shows
3 to 6 inches of fairly good stone. A few small
crushings have helped, but a reef which has
shown no improvement in size to a depth ox
nearly 200 ft. doesn’t promise much. Under-
lies are much more costly than levels, and it
would seem good policy now to put out a
long level from both sides of the shaft.
No. 4 North Phcenix, Gympie (Q.), has
not been hitting any bonanzas lately,
although development work has been pro-
ceeding around the 784 ft. level. There the
co. is in formation, carrying small leaders
with colors, and promising enough to en-
courage the continuance of the search, especi-
ally as plumbago floors come in occasionally.
Shareholders get all the excitement they
want in a show like the Phoenix.
Walter Colley’s sampling of the Madden-
Buchanan lodes, Palmer goldfields (N.Q.),
has encouraged the Oaks Consolidated to
make an offer to give the Buchanan a go.
Averages went from 3Jdwt. to sclwt., with
lOdwt. in sulphides at HOft. The ore bodies
are enormous, and Colley found values
throughout. He considers it “reasonable to
suppose that values may improve with depth,
and recommends that a small prospecting shaft
be put down 50ft. and crosscuts shoved out
r 0 test width and values there. As the
syndicate is out of funds, the offer of the
Oaks co. will probably be accepted. -that
concern, which has an uncalled cap tal ot
£50,000 and an up-to-date plant, battled suc-
cessfully with 3dwt. stuff for years, and as
Palmer gold is worth around £4 per oz.
against Oaks’s £3 Bs.. it may have a chance at
the Buchanan if development proves re-
serves to be of slightly better average grade
than Colley’s sampling.
Billy Hughes pref. holders are willing to
give the Bruce mine, Normanbv (N.O-).
a try, and operations threaten to be in full
swing shortly. Manager Meredith talks ot
27dwt. values, including sands, and expects
assistance from a 2oz. lode in the neai-by
Perseverance. *
John T ennox, having got the Canary, Kan-
garoo Hills (N.Q-), off his hands, has
now taken an option over the Jugular, an-
other promising show, whose prospects were
discussed by the “Wild Cat” a few weeks
back. John L. has been good at picking
winners lately, and his latest is another
promising starter. m
For the half-year ended March no work
was done on Mt. Bischoff Extended (Tas.).
Assets included War Loan, £5044; stocks
of stores, firewood, etc., £2638; sundries
£B9 • against which were bank overdraft ana
other debits for £920. The mine recently
restarted on a limited scale, selective mining
being the order of the day. Manager Schell
reports payable ore in and over No. 6 level,
but at present prices of tin there can be
very little, if any, profit in operations.
A discoverv of rich stream-tin has been
made at the foot of Mt. Cameron .(Tas.).
A new co., the Monarch Tin Mines, is being
formed in Melbourne to place a suction
dredging plant on the 500 acres secured.
Values up to 7ilb. are claimed, but that maj
be only a patch. The Endurance operates
on the opposite side of the mountain, and
it cleaned-up 27 tons oxide for April. Now
that the wet season has set in, better returns
should be obtained. # *
The present price of osmiridium, around
£25 per oz., is not good enough for the aver-
age claim, so the output of the Speck dig-
gings has fallen considerably. The payable
area is very limited, but when the metfil was
at the boom price of £47 per ounce good
wages were made by turning over the same
ground three or four times. Much dissatis-
faction exists among the remaining diggers
owing to the delay between the advance
granted by the Government on delivery and
the final settlement. They now claim that
the elimination of private buying is not
helping them. Some of the old hands aie
bolding their metal in the hope of better
prices, and are seeking employment on the
Bischoff mines.
“W’gabba”: Melbourne is not the only
capital city that may harbor a gokhmine.
Brisbane is largely built on just as ancient a
formation, and at several points in and
around the metropolis metals, including gold,
have been proved in payable quantities. Ihe
geological formation consists of Ordovician
slates, schists and quartzites, notable for
their quartz veinlets. Payable gold in this
formation has already been found at Kings-
ton and Brookfield, both quite close to the
city, and there are prospects at Belmont.
Coorpooroo and several other suburbs.
cognisance is taken of the ore-diviners who
assert that it would pay to take up the con-
crete in Queen-street. Inside the three-mile
limit are the fairly extensive silver-lead
deposits at Indooroopilly, which owed their
discovery to the merest accident in a local
resident’s garden. There may be others simi-
larly awaiting discovery by fortuitous cir-
cumstances. The sewerage works at present
in hand have revealed numerous traces of
gold in veins in the city area, although so
far nothing to get excited over. On top ol
the Ordovician beds in some of the suburbs
lie the Ipswich coal measures, and seams are
known to exist at Nundah and Moorooka. In
the latter locality a 4ft. seam was recently
found in a bore at a'shallow depth. I like
Brisbane’s chances better than those of the
hamlet by the Yarra.

“Oxmead”: Re the pother about the at-
tempted exhumation in London of the bones
of Pocahontas, it would appear that the lady
has left descendants all over the earth.
Among those who claim a dash of her blood,

it is announced, are Mrs. Harding, wife of
the U.S. President,, and General Baden-
Powell, the Panjandrum of the Boy Scout
•movement. The Commonwealth isn’t out in
the cold, either. A South Australian clan,
rhe Stows, are said to have a lineage that
takes; them back to the Indian princess.
There,was a Stow who was Attorney-General
of thA southern State over half-a-century ago
—the' one of whom Gordon wrote “Like
Stowiat our hustings confronting the hisses
Of roughs with his queer Mephistopheles
smile;’’ Anyway, 20 years back, there was
a brafich of the family at Esperance (W.A.),
and as proof of the Pocahontas ancestry
there was one little girl in whom most people
professed to see some flickering resemblance
to the’North American Indian type. As far
as the records go, Pocahontas, or Mrs. John
Rolfe, left only one son, but as he flourished
300 years ago there may very well be whole
rafts of descendants in existence nowadays.
“Wilfrido”: A well-known M.L. lawyer
who possessed the fatal habit of running up
against the Bench was finally suspended for
three months for filing a scandalous affidavit
reflecting on the honor of a certain Judge.
Shortly afterwards he contested a seat in the
Labor interest, and, as is usual in these cases,
his alleged victimisation was used to win him
sympathy and votes. An Irishman who took
the chair at one of his meetings was especi-
ally insistent on the candidate being regarded ■
as a martyr. “Mr. Blank stood for right
against might,” he declared in introducing
him. “He was one against many. And what
have they done? They have crucified him.
They have hanged him.” “No, no!” inter-
posed the candidate. “Not hanged-—merely
suspended.”
* * * *
“Monaro”: “Taiiwarra’s” tale of a vote of
thanks to the Bishop at a Papuan prospec-
tor’s graveside (B. 31/5/’23) reminds me of
the passing of Jimmy Yokohama in the roar-
ing days of the Kanowna (W.A.) goldfield,
some 27 years ago. The Japanese engaged the
local band to follow Jimmy’s conclusion.
The musicians hadn’t progressed far on their
two-mile tramp when the Japs took excep-
tion to the dirge-like nature of the music.
The band had recently been imbibing Gilbert
and Sullivan, so, to a quickened step, the
brightest parts of “Pinafore” were dashed
through. “The Mikado” followed. At the
graveside the instrumentalists switched on to
“Rule Britannia” and scores of Caucasian
spectators joined in the lusty chorus. The
final round of cheers that accompanied de-
ceased into the pealce of the grave nearly split
the coffin (six candle-cases stayed end-ways
with fence-wire). “Anyway, his ancestors’ll
hear Jimmy coming,” someone said. Whether
they did or did not, there were diggers four
miles away who heard him going.

“Sarc” in optimistic vein :
There is no doubt that insulin, the new cure tor
diabetes, has come to stay. Already cases treated
with the substance in Melbourne have shown excellent
results. One physician, a specialist on diabetes, re-
gards it as the most dramatic discovery in modern
medicine; He cites the case of a patient who had
resisted every available method of treatment for
months being rendered sugar-free by one injection.
But it may be emphasised that many eases of diabetes
do not need insulin ; and the administration of the sub-
stance must be carefully controlled by periodic estima-
tions of the amount of sugar in the blood. It would
be disastrous if every G.P. were allowed to pump
insulin into his patients indiscriminately; in large
doses it has the effect of depleting the blood sugar,
and so causing convulsions and other distressing
symptoms. / ■
“U.P.”: No Jew detests the flesh of the
swine as the Afghan does. At Broken Hill,
when I was working with a
station-supply firm, we had
to depend on Afghans to
take the goods to ou.t-back
stations; but nothing would
induce them to handle a con-
signment that included the
unclean meat. On one occa-
sion a ’Ghan driver, dis-
covering that he had a
couple of middles of bacon
in his load, dumped the
cargo a few miles out of
town and returned with an
unloaded camel to anathe-
matise the firm. After this
it was difficult to get bacon
carried at all except by
some such device as placing
it in cases labelled “Confec-
tionery.” When a knot of
the smellsome ’Ghan carriers
congregated in the ware-
house and made their pres-
ence displeasing to the Euro-
pean ear and nose, they
could always be dispersed
by dumping a side of bacon
in the vicinity. They would
jump off then as suddenly
as if the stuff was a bomb.

“Iford”: “J.R.D..” in “The Cant of
Archaism” (B. 24/o/’23), suggests that "the
wines of ancient Greece were well enough
for poets to sing about, but, flavored as
they were with pitch, resin, sea-water, tur-
pentine and burnt shells to reduce their
acidity,” they must have been a sore trial
for the stomach. There is a passage in “The
Life of Henry Labouchere” that supplies
some confirmation of this view. In
“Labbv” was a diplomatic attache at Con-
stantinople. The embassy in those days was
so hard up, according to him, that there was
no money to buy decent vintages, and the
wine with which Lord Hailing, the British
Ambassador, was wont to regale his guests,
while it was handed round as “Chateau
Lafit.te” or “La Rose.” really came from the
neighboring Greek isles, and had been doc-
tored with an infusion of prunes to tone
down the reek of tar inseparable from these
insular vintages. “Lord Dalling himself was
so anxious to play the r6le of a hospitable
entertainer that he would pledge his guests
in glass after glass of the horrible beverage,
swallowing numberless pills the while as an
antidote.” After artless disclosures like
these, it is hard to feature the most enthusi-
astic archaist quaffing his bowl of Chian
or Samian with anything gusto.
From an Australian girl in Holland :
Germany is now almost another Thibet. Visitors
are admitted only if they have real business to do,
and it is no end of trouble to get the necessary

papers. Hotel tariffs there are staggering, clothes
very cheap, and the tipping nuisance as bad as it
can be. At the hotels you are surrounded by
waiters —a fresh man, it seems, for every dish, the
whole crottd thus earning a right to dip into your
pockets. ‘ The tourist is few, and he has to be
made to stretch as far as possible. No butter is
procurable, but some sort of made fat is offered as
a substitute; no milk can be had, no fruit and very
little cheese. Bread is rationed; it is a browny-
yellow color, very coarse, and tastes of sawdust.
In almost all the shops there are notices: “Belgians
and French are not welcome.” There is not the
same attitude towards English-speaking people; but
everywhere you are given to understand that you
are eating food that can’t be spared. The Hollander,
as usual, says little. But there appears to be a
general idea that Germany’s patience is no mote
inexhaustible than France’s, and that in the end
there may be war between these two again.

“Tarago”: “Ex-Dig.’s” par (B. 31/5/’23)
on the Sydney citizen who returned home to
find a superfluous wife claiming him revives
sad memories of an experience of my own.
Shortly after returning to Aussie I received
a letter, re-directed from the Melbourne
G.P.0., from a lady in Wales (U.K.), claim-
ing me as her lawful husband, and wonder-
ing why I had not sent her passage money
along. I hastily re-sealed the letter and
silently returned it to the G.P.O. I’ve heard
nothing since, but, Lord, one never knows!
“Alkaloid” on the diabetes cure:—
Tell “Macquarie Street” (B. 31/5/’23) that insulin
is already in use in Australia. The Commonwealth
Serum Laboratories —one of the few Federal proposi-
tions that have been an unqualified financial success
—have been carrying out experimental work in
the preparation of the extract along the lines laid
down by the Toronto bio-chemists. The main diffi-
culty lies in getting the pancreas early enough after
slaughter of the animal-—before the autolytic pro-
cesses have destroyed the essential element in the
gland. As “Macquarie Street” says, the hypodermic
method of administration is a marked disadvantage,
necessitating treatment at such frequent intervals'.
But up to the present oral administration has been
disappointing, even when given in capsules, resistant
to acid gastric digestion. Further research directed
towards the production of an article stable to gastro-
intestinal enzyme action is desirable, Maybe a syn-
thetic organic compound comparable to Kendall’s
thyroxin will emerge from one or other of the experi-
mental laboratories.

“D.F.”: All kinds of weird reasons have
been trotted out to account for the Biblical
and Oriental names in parts of the Speck—
the Jordan, Lake Tiberias, Jerusalem, Bag-
dad and Abyssinia. The real origin is simple.
Hugh Germain, a murine who came to the
Derwent with Collins in 1804, became a
hunter in the lean years when famine pinched
the land. With two convict assistants he
wandered over the southern part of the island
hunting the kangaroo and the- emu. Only
one of the three could read, and the portable
library with which he solaced his companions
in their hours of leisure consisted of a Bible
and an old copy of the “Arabian Nights.”
It was from these that the names came. Ger-
main said years - afterwards that for five
years he never slept in a bed. He and his
tWo mates used to turn in to the Government
Stores an average of 10001 b. of meat a month.
The hunters associated a good deal with the
abos. and found them harmless till driven to
desperation by the outrages of the baser sort
of white men.
* * *
“Whitehall” philosophises:—
The sudden death in Sydney within a few days cf
Herbert Maitland, Denison Miller and William
McArthur should provide a needed lesson to the
elderly. Maitland, half-deceived apparently by his
appearance of splendid health, engaged in physical
effort, literally to the day of his death, which would
have knocked out many a- man 30 years his junior.
A round of golf, a surf, ten minutes’ hard boxing
and a spell of Swedish exercises—these were relaxa-
tions that he thought nothing of crowding into one
day. Miller played golf and played it hard; and
till quite recently McArthur was one of a little band
of elderly Union Club members who went in for
privately-played cricket. Of these three McArthur
alone could be called old (he was 66), but he came
of a long-lived family, and kept young. The prohibi-
tionist might well drop his argument about alcohol
being a killer and substitute for it violent exercise. In
every community one finds whisky-sodden and beer-
impregnated old persons looking the degraded beings
they are, but suffering no particular discomfort and
living to ripe old ages. And side by side with them
are clear-eyed, boyish-faced men, such as Herbert
Maitland, who, having made a cult of physical fit-
ness all their lives, pass gently out with their work
only half done. It is erroneous to imagine that men
do not join bowling clubs till they get old; they live
to be old because they took to bowls in youth.

“R. T. Fishull” : I am still wondering if
it was unconscious humor. I was attending
a lady patient, and on leaving took up my
Stetson velour to depart, when the husband
said to me: “I like the look of your hat,
doctor. If it is not a rude question, how-
much did it cost?” I told him that I had
paid six guineas for it. “Cripes!” said he,
and added after a few seconds’ reflection:
“Rut, then, you doctors have got to dress to
kill.”

Whose words are not polite.
The seas of all the world I know,
Their spaces are my home;
As child its mother loves (Yo-hol)
I love the salt-sea foam.
But never, never shall I sail
Upon the rolling seas
With captains rude enough to fail
To add to orders “please.”
The captains whom I’m used to know
Are naught if not polite;
They tuck us into bed (Yo-ho!)
And kiss their crews good-night.
It's “Will you, please,” “Be good enough,”

For on the seas, though we be rough,

THE FAMOUS
RED PACKET
“Collonna”: When the keeper of the Bris-
bane Police Court cells beholds a certain
vagabond being ushered in he groans. The
man has the uncanny power, by means of
sly suggestions and malicious innuendoes, of
starting a brawl in whatever company he is
placed—and keeping clear of it himself. On
a recent occasion he was put in with two
coolies who understood only a very little
English, yet in a few minutes he had
them trying to choke each other. They
pulled the derelict Puck out and pushed him
in the next cell—amongst a crowd of city-
drunks. In a few minutes an uproar arose
suggestive of an agitated menagerie, and
the policeman in charge hurried to the
cell to find its team of moist occu-
pants engaged in a combat under bottle-oli
rules-—and the instigator of the trouble
nearly helpless with laughter. In despera-
tion they threw him into the night. The Law
was beat.
“H.H.”: The Vic. Railway Department
announces that it is anxious to receive sug-
gestions tending towards improvement. A
thief snatched a bag containing nearly £3OOO
of wages. The police roped in a suspect, and
in the subsequent proceedings the P.M. in-
quired about the revolver an officer is sup-
posed to carry when burdened with much
cash. It seemed the plundered official car-
ried such a weapon—had done so for three
years, in fact—but it was never loaded.
Some other officials left the gun behind.
Some carried it empty. Some put it in the
bag with the money, so that when a thief
snatched the bag he took the gun also. As
a minor detail, the bag wasn’t locked....
Now, then!

BERYL: “I wouldn't marry a spendthrift, would you?”
PEARL: “If he was just starting on his career I might.”
“Caveman” considers young Sawbones: —
Of the hundred or so young doctors whom
Sydney Uni. lately sent out into the world I am
personally acquainted with nine and with their
parents. And I hope I shall keep well. Not one
of the nine had any natural gift or inclination for
the medical track ; not one scored better than a pass.
No. 1 wanted to do something mechanical —engineer-
ing for choice. But his father, having done rather
well in his drapery store, decided after ponderous
deliberation that No. 1 was to “be a doctor.’’
The ease of No. 2 is as bad. She is a girl and
has a liking for dress-designing. Now, dress-designers
don’t grow in clusters everywhere, and she had
notions .of giving the game a fly. But purse-proud
father, who is a senior clerk somewhere, decided
that she, too, should “be a doctor.” No. 3 used to be
clever at drawing and design. I judge this to be a
good architect spoilt to make an indifferent surgeon.
No. 4 was fascinated by plants and their culture.
He used his spare time in growing vegetables,

and did it wonderfully well. But for “the honor of

he was switched off to medicine. The other five
are much the same. You can’t blame the students.
The parents, puffed with conceit, bolstered with igno-
rance, and purse-proud to bursting point, care nothing
for the actual future life of their progeny. And
that’s the point I want to make. In the coming
generation you won’t be sure that the stray doctoi
you call in will know anything of medicine. The
only reasonably sure thing about him (or her) will
be that he (or she) had a, snob for a father.
“V.C.: Walhalla was busy
in those days, but that January
afternoon only a few loungers
awaited the coach. Across the
dusty street a man leaned
against a post outside the store.
It was big and truculent
“Black” Morris, who, although
in the town only two days, had
already sent three men home for,
repairs. A cracking whip broke
the silence, and down the main
street a bullock-team raised
clouds of dust. By its side
trudged a quaint figure dressed
in moleskins and a man’s coat,
in addition it had a skirt, and
there was a mop of black hair
showing under the cabbage-tree
hat. Walhalla knew “Mother”
Burton, and respected her for
the fight she was putting up
since a falling tree had robbed
her five little girls of their
breadwinner. In all weathers
her team toiled up and down
the mountain tracks, and the
driver’s pluck never failed. At
the store the waggon “ was
halted while “Mother” Burton
went inside. When she came
out “Black” Morris laid a hand
on her arm. “Wait a minute,
girlie,” he said with a leer. But
“Mother” walked on. He threw
an insulting expression after
her. For reply the long whip
curled and struck. Stung with
the pain “Black” Morris jumped
forward, rage in his face. But
a coil of the long lash round
his legs brought him down.
Scientifically “Mother” thrash d
him as he scrambled up, tripped
him and lashed him as he tried to craw: away,
his face in the dust. A quiet word, the team
took the strain of the load, and the lumber-
ing waggon moved on.
“Spall”: Within 50 miles (as the crow
flies) of Sydney G.P.O. there is an area of
20 acres of land which the foot of man has
never trod. The area is s tuated wittiin the
Y.erranderie silver-field, 40 m les by road
from Camden. Owing to the denudation of
the surrounding country, an oval-shape mesa
of sandstone has been left, with vertical cliff -
faces from 150 to 200 feet high. No scalable
break occurs, and, as fire-escapes are not
in use on the field, the inquisitive have to be
content with gazing at this no man’s land
from afar.

“Hermes”: I have been playing patience
with the index of C. E. W. Bean’s “Story
of Anzac,” which is Vol. I. of the Australian
Official History, and the result is worth
passing on, I think. In the index are about
400 names of Australians and Maorilanders
who receive “mentions” in the text. The
majority of those 400 men have had foot-
notes written about them, showing, among
other things, their professions or callings.
What seems to me so extraordinary is that
over 100 professions or callings are repre-
sented by the 400 men. There are more
permanent soldiers and graziers than any
others, but farmers and schoolteachers are
well in the straight. The list of jobs shows
how representative of Australia the A.I.F.
really was.
* * * *
“Feluja” : Like “F. J.M.” (B. 31/5/’23) I
formed a real admiration for the fighting
quality of the Glioorka. I recall the first
battle of Ramadie (on the Euphrates) in
Mespot, when the Connaught Rangers, Dor-
sots and Ghoorkas made their ill-fated at-
tempt to capture that dirty little village. In
the early morning the Dorsets and Ghoorkas
hopped over side by side, their objective
the Turkish trenches some 500 yards
off. It was open, level country, and the
withering Turkish fire caused the Dorsets,
half-way across, to waver. There was a
big English captain leading the Ghoorkas on
the Dorsets’ right. “Gome on, Dorsets;
don’t let the Ghoorkas down a gam ! ’ ho
shouted. They didn’t, but all the attacking
troops were badly cut up, though the Con-
naught Rangers had sufficient men left to
fight a hot rearguard action in the three
days’ retreat in a temperature of 130 deg.
Tlie Ghoorkas were more than once inad-
eouately supported, but there was no record
of their ever “letting down” white troops.
“J.O’L.”: I met “James B.’s” (B.
7/6/’23) old battler a few miles out of
Singleton (N.S.W.). He was still headed
for a brother in Tamworth. I camped with
him for a night, and his reading matter
was a volume of Gibbon someone had given
him. A month or so later I was in Tam-
worth and met the aged pram-wheeler in
PeeLstreet. He was sittinsr dejectedly on
the post-office steps. His brother had moved
to a daughter’s place in ivilkivan (Q.).
But he was pushing on in the monrng. I
wonder where he found his Ultima Thule.

“F.T.K.”: The par. of “H.K.” (B.
7/6/’23) re St. Stan slaus’ reminds me thal
this Bathurst college has in one of its class-
rooms what is reputed to be a Madonna of
Bernardino Luini, although its authenticity
has never yet been certified bv ary estab-
lished expert. Renaissance masters aren’t
to be picked up every day in Australia, but
all the evidence available supports the claim
that this is genuine. The Lazarists (or, as
we call them here, the Vincent.ans) have
many houses in Europe, and it is quite
possible that one of them acquired the paint-
ing and transferred it here. #
“Hamer”: The land at Moore Park which
the Sydney Cricket Ground trustees want to
turn into a third oval is all that remains of
what used to be known as “The Garrison
in the volunteer days. The riflemen used
to hold their annual camps there: Sydney
Cricket Ground No. 2 and the Sports Ground
have mopped up the rest oi the area. Farther
up, what used to be called Red Hill —it is now
part of the Agricultural Ground —was used as a
rifle range before the target-marksmen were
shoved out to' Long Bay. “The . Garrison
was intersected by fences with many pal-
ings missing; and it used to provide a.Str.a-..
tegie retreat for small boys pursued by the'
police for bathing in Lake Ivippax in the
“nood.”
“ J.E.”: That ghostly scaremonger Conan
Doyle, father of Sherlock Holmes and Dr.
Watson, has had a revelation from the de-
ceased Northcliffe, millionaire newspaper
proprietor, and from “other spirits.” It
appears that “the world is approaching a
terrible catastrophe, which will make the
World War seem insignificant and will pro
bably engulf whole continents.” This mat-
erial disturbance can only be averted by “a
wave of spiritual unheavul. Spiritual up-
heaval is of many kinds, including plain
Mohammedanism, Mahdism, Mormonism and
Methodism, so it is a pity the rich ghost
wasn’t more definite. And it would be satis-
fying to know his authority—whether St.
Peter told him, or whether the knowledge
grew on him like moss. Possibly that great
meteor which may have caused Noah’s deluge
when it almost grazed the earth and dragged
the seas out of their beds by the., power of
its attraction —in fact, made the supreme
tidal wave of all time —is almost due again
on its long, eternal round. It, wasn’t the
circumstance of the rain falling for 40 days
and nights that made the trouble, for it
falls like that in the rainy season of many
countries as an annual matter of course.
It was the fact that “the same day were ail
the fountains of the great deep broken up.” A
heavenly body quite large enough to do all
that damage when passing at very close range
—almost touching, in fact —might yet be
small enough to escape notice till very near
the hour of the catastrophe, so it may be
looked for almost any day. Probably it will
be looked for without success, like the other
end of the world which was due in a.d. 10C0
and the one foretold by the Gumming
man for 1866. Most ends of the world have
been unsatisfactory—it is difficult to remem-
ber an end that was a complete success. It
is to be hoped the approaching event won’t
“engulf” too many continents, for we possess
only six, and we might easily be left short.
The ghosts when they had got so far might

THE FEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You are my fancy; I’ve visions most tender
Of a snug little cottage with you by my side;
A . nice easy chair, with my feet on the fender,
Where all the world’s winters we two might deride;
But sti l I pause, dreading my vision to test.
For my friends who have married are not always
blest.
I have seen bridegrooms full of a passionate ardor
Who went to the altar and found it a rope ;
Whose lives are now full of restocking the larder,
Who’ve lost the last shred of romantic young hope,
For each dainty'girl, at the altar demure,
On the curb drives them now with a hand firm and
6ure.
If they ever, on impulse, kick over the traces
The lash they must feel (it is mostly a tongue).
They’re ruled by their women, and kept in their
places, ,
Forgetting the freedom of when they were young.
From all I would choose you ; I love you, dear Nancy.
But I dread in my heart to give reins to my fancy!

IMPERSONAL
“Denny” Miller never got swelled head;
and not very many in the same circumstances
could have escaped it. The g-m.’s inspector
and handyman in “the Wales,” he became the
absolute ruler over a bank whose growth
was without precedent perhaps in the world.
His attitude towards the men who had
worked with him in the old bank never
changed. He remained to the end a simple-
minded man—even obstinate in his simple-
mindedness. To that more than anything
else were due such errors as he committed.
One with a greater gift for intrigue would
have avoided them —or, at any rate, appeared
to. Those who were associated with him
sometimes believed that he was wrong; but
if they thought rather less of him as a
banker for it, they liked him all the better
as a man.
“D.”: After watching the Irish envoys
trailing their coats before the Federal Board
and its minions last week (“He’s a cadaver-
ous old paw r n” ; “I’ll retire from the proceed-
ings, so I will”; “Show more respect to the
cloth there, will ye?” and so on), I have
come to the conclusion that England made
no mistake in issuing our visitors with pass-
ports. The idea clearly is to provide the
Empire tyith an
object-lesson in the
kind of thing the
ruthless Sassenach
oppressor has had
to put up with. It
was a shrewd
notion to send
O’Kelly and his
ecclesiastical friend
moaning and revil-
in g round the
world, and no one
but a disloyalist or
a congenital idiot
would do anything
to put a stop to
the activities of
the exiles.

Randal Carey, for over 40 years chairman
of directors of Sydney Telegraph, died in
Sydney the other day. He was in M.L. in
the roaring days of the West Coast (South
Island) gold rush, and had an office at Hoki-
tika, where he did a great business in bring-
ing rushers to the Helldorado of the time.
His former partner, a great admirer of Carey,
used to tell the story of how Bully Hayes
came to Hokitika and the compliment he
paid to the later director of the Sydney
D.T.’s fortunes. Hayes came ashore after
supplies, and made his way straight to the
office of Carey and Gillies, universal pro-
viders for shipping. He knew Carey only bv
repute, but insisted upon doing business with
him alone. When he met him, “Well, Carey,”
said Bully, “we’ve never met; but you know
me and I know you. I want some things,
and we’ve got to do business. I’m Hayes.
It s Greek and Greek to-day, Carey!” The
old warrior had reached his 90th year when
the end came.
W. A. McArthur, who died in Sydney,
close to the street of his birth, last week,
was a wonderfully sweet-natured little man,
one of those rare characters that no blow
of fate can embitter. He was elected to the
House of Commons 36 years ago as a Lib-
eral—he was just 30 at the time—and be-
came a Junior Lord of the Treasury five
years later. His equable temperament and
his personal charm made him one of the
best Chief Whips the Liberal party in Eng-
land ever had. At 50 he learned that W.
and A. McArthur, whose business had pro-
vided him, and his father before him, with a
substantial income, were in a bad way. Mo he
had to get out of politics and begin over
again—the McArthur Shipping and Agency
Co. was formed the following year. He never
repined over his changed financial circum-
stances, but he had a love of politics in bis
blood, and his thoughts turned continually
to Westminster and the great men he had
watched in action there. A clever and hum-
orous anecdotist, he had an immense stock
of yarns about his political friends and foes,
most of them amusing and all devoid of
rancor. He was living at the Union Club
when the seizure occurred that was to prove
fatal. In London he was a popular member
of the Garrick.
One of the most interesting scraps of
paper in the Lands Office, Melbourne, is a
portrait of Robert
Russell, who
arrived in Victoria
in 1836 and was
the first Govern-
ment surveyor. In
1837 he surveyed
the site of the city,
and it wasn’t an
easy job, for West
Melbourne was a
swamp and Fitz-
roy a matted forest.
Russell’s first sub-
division sale was
held in Sydney;
among other blocks
the present site of
the Bank of Aus-
tralasia in Collins-
street was sold. It
fetched £7O.
DENISON
MILLER, Gover-
nor of the Com-
monwealth Bank,
who died last week
after two days'
illness.
Died in England, A. E. Thomas, a well-
known W.A. mine-manager of other days,
who sat for Norseman in the Assembly for
a couple of terms. Thomas was sometimes
known as the member for the Esperance rail-
way (which isn’t yet constructed, by the
way), but his longest-remembered Parlia-
mentary effort was made when he once turned
aside from championing goldfields require-
ments to criticise the administration of Gov-
ernment experimental farms in the cocky dis-
tricts. There wasn’t enough variety in the
crops experimented with, he urged. ITis own
idea would be to have a patch of wheat here,
a growth of barley there and a plot of (say)
pollard in the offing. A stunned silence suc-
ceeded the observation, and then, from the
bench where half-a-dozen whiskered hayseeds
(predecessors of the C.P.’s of to-day) sat in
a mostly somnolent bunch, a yell of delight
that nearly lifted the roof. Thomas always
insisted that he meant to say lucerne, and got
the words mixed, but he never quite lived
it down.
“Friday Island” : Fate had it that E. J.
Banfield (“The Beachcomber”) should die
on Dunk Island as he arrived 20 years be-
fore—with the sole: companionship of his
wife and dog. When I visited the island in
1918 Banfield had neighbors—an invalided
Navy man with wife and child, who was
seeking to recuperate, like “The Beach-
comber” himself. Apparently they didn’t
stay long in the outmf-the-way spot.
Although often styled “The Hermit of Dunk
Island,” E.J.B. had many visitors—mostly
naval and merchant-marine officers, who
thoroughly enjoyed Mrs. Banfield’s cooking
and their host’s interesting conversation and
zoological collections. His miniature-shell
collection would take some beating’. The life
of this lovable couple in a tropical-island
paradise could well be styled a classical
“Romance of Middle Age,” for, from 50
years onward, they regained health and youth,
and successfully fought Nature to establish
a cosy home amid wild surroundings.
Mrs. Kate Dwyer, the only member of the
“majority” A.L.P. executive in Sydney to
be spared by the vote of an insurgent con-
ference, is one of the three Golding sisters
•—Belle and Annie were the others —who
were original battlers for the suffrage in the
days of Mrs. Martel and Mrs. Molyneux
Parkes. Mrs. Dwyer, who married a school-
master, has managed to combine household
cares with strenuous work for the Labor
movement. Always she was the leading
spirit in women’s activities at the Trades
Hall; and she has been mainly responsible
for the birth of the trade unions of women.
Whenever a woman rep. was wanted on a
commission of inquiry into working condi-
tions, it was natural for the selection to fall
to Mrs. Dwyer. More than once she has
come very close to selection as a Labor
Senate candidate.
“X.Y.”: S. K. Miller, one-time dominie of
Deniliquin (N.S.W.) and father of the
Commonwealth Bank’s late chief, was a pic-
turesque figure with curling locks of silvery
hair. The banker’s foresight was inherited.
It used to be his dad’s boast, in the ’sixties,
that he flourished a hundred years before his
time. To incredulous pupils he foretold the
time when Deniliquin folk would converse
freely with friends in Sydney and Melbourne,
and traverse the continent in airships. Deni-
son’s boyhood was rather a sad one owing to
a regrettable incident with a pea-rifle, by
which he lost a warm chum. His sister was
gifted in art; one of her best oils, “Tickle,”
was the first prize in a 100-guinea art union.
For many years this painting was greatly
prized by the winner, a junior colleague of
“5.K.,” who afterwards became an inspector
of schools.
“Palam”: Alec Russell, who is to be confi-
dential unofficial sec. to Priminister Bruce at
the Imperial Conference, is a fellow-member
of the Melbourne Club and the P.M.’s golfing
partner. Not caring for station life, and hav-
ing been comfortably provided for by his rich
father, Russell is being encouraged to take
an interest in public affairs, which he studies
between golf and bridge. When Bruce’s con-
stituents in Flinders want, say, a telephone,
Bruce gets bis pal to pilot the deputation
to the Department, so that he may obtain ex-
perience ; and the idea in taking him to Eng-
land is to give him still wider opportunities.
Russell has been given accommodation at the
Prime Minister’s Department, but has not
been appointed to the public service.
“N’lmporte”: William Arthur George
Evance, who died at Bendigo the other day
in his. 95th year, claimed that he was the
30th in the direct line from Alfred the
Great. Evance said he could trace his ances-
try through Edward 111., Thomas of Wood-
stock and Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cam-
bridge. His great-great-great-grandfather,
Edward Devereux of Cefngwernva and the
Gaer, was brother to Vaughan Devereux, an-
cestor of the present Viscount Hereford.
His connection with the Welsh royal people
dates through Cadell, King of South Wales,
and his father, Roderick the Great. The
last-known male descendant of the Evances
of Treveleth was buried in Back Creek ceme-
tery, Bendigo.
Died at Brisbane, aged 60, F. J. B. Martin,
late President of the Queensland Teachers’
Assoc. Coming from England he joined the
Education Dept, in 1887, and conscientiously
head-mastered many schools—among them
Bundaberg, Maryborough, Rockhampton and
New Farm —with a slight break of two years
as an inspector.
“Tay-Pay”: The allegation of Father
O’Flanagan that Dr. Mannix would not now
be Archbishop of Melbourne if the Vatican
could have foreseen his early attitude on the
Irish question is probably correct. At May-
nooth Majinix kept clear of noisy public
issues, and on that record, added, of course,
to his undoubted capacity, he measured up
to the size of a serviceable archbishop in
Papal eyes. England’s influence is and
always has been a potent factor in influenc-
ing Papal actions. For instance, an Irish
“extremist” has never worn the Roman
Purple. Cardinal Logue and all his prede-
cessors were men of moderation, and the
aged cardinal’s successor is likely to be of
like mould. Home and dry in Melbourne the
Vatican will leave Mannix. His militancy
probably cost him the See of Dublin and a
red hat when Dr. Walsh went west.
John George Bice, one of the brand-new
K.C.M.G.’s, will be 70 on June 24. He is a
Cousin Jack who started life as a black-
smith at Moonta, and has been in S. Aus.
Parliament continuously for 27 years. He
was in the Pt-ice-Peake Ministry in 1908-09,
and has been a member of all the Liberal
Administrations since.
William Loton, Westralia’s newest K. 8.,
has been sprayed by the honors fountain at
the ripe age of 84. A native of Stafford-
shire, he arrived beside the silver Swan 60
years ago, and, beginning as a storekeeper,
hoed the furrows of commerce and finance
so successfully that for the past 20 years
he has had the reputation of being Perth’s
most opulent citizen. As a politician Loton
belongs to a past generation. Tie sat in the
State Parliament before Australia federated
—and even before W.A. secured responsible
government.
J. G. BICE, South Australia's Chief Secre-
tary, who has just been made a K.C.M.G.
“O.P. Hand”: Walter Murdoch, in his
Deakin book, just published, recalls that his
hero handed back £4OO of the £lOOO allowed
him by the McLean Government (Vic.) to
go to London to help Barton and Kingston
shepherd the Commonwealth Draft Bill. If
is a wonder there is any mention of the inci-
dent. Deakin regarded Shiels’s commenda-
tion of his economy as the most agonising
thing of his life. Barton, who had been urg-
ing his own State to supplement the £lOOO
granted him, had been given a chair on the
floor of the Vic. Assembly while Shiels was
delivering his Budget speech containing the
slobbery reference to Deakin. Nothing could
have been in worse taste on Shiels’s part, and
Deakin squirmed in embarrassment.
“The Deacon”: The Holman majority that
once fell over a balustrade in N.S.W. Par-
liament House, and had to go to hospital
when he was most wanted in the Assembly,
turned up as an A.W.U. delegate from
liiverina at the Labor rumpus. Jack Mee-
han has held many jobs since the days when
he campaigned along the Darling delivering
his policy speeches in liquid form carried on
pack-horses. (The only time John mentioned
the dread word “Parliament” was when he
introduced it into some particularly lurid
yarn.) Incidentally, one of his best was of
the time when he was serving a sentence for
some political sin or other. He didn’t
approve of the diet provided for his Majesty’s
guests, and promptly organised a hunger-
strike. Telling the story afterwards he used
to swear that there were better unionists in
gaol than out of it. “Dammit all,” said he,
“back there in the clink they were all good
unionists. Not a blanky prisoner of the lot
scabbed it!” On one occasion John accom-
panied Donald Macdonell, then Chief Sec.,
to Dubbo, where he was to open a hospital
or something. A police escort was provided,
to which the modest Minister objected.
“Well,” said Meehan, with a retrospective
grin, “you ought to be darn’d glad they are
in front of you instead of behind!”
Frank Clarke, Vic. Minister for Works,
who has been gallivanting about Europe for
six months, is due in Melbourne on June
20—just in time to take a hand in the final
preparations for the session opening on July
4. Clarke has been five years and seven
months in office, having first joined Bowser
in November, 1917. In August he’ll know r
whether his innings is to last much longer.
Government supporters are talking about
“ending or mending” the Ministry.
Some June anniversaries: 19th, 1820,
Joseph Banks, “Father of Australia” died;
20th, 1905, explorer A. C. Gregory died;
21st, 1845, Samuel Griffith born; 22nd, 1845,
Dick Seddon, of Maoriland, born; 24 th,
1870, poet Adam Lindsay Gordon shot him-
self at Brighton (Vic.) ; 30th, 1825, the late
Baron von Mueller, botanist, born.
T. J. O’Hagan, who goes as private
sec. to Bananaland’s rep. at the British
Empire Exhibition, earns his damper as
chief clerk in the Justice Department. He
went with the A.A.M. Corps in 1914.
O’Hagan is a brother-in-law of McCawley,
C.J., but that has nothing to do with the
case.
A BALLAD OF TOOTHLESSNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The gods send nuts to those with no teeth.” —
Spanish proverb.
Think on the days when life was new
And every sense was clear and keen,
When all the skies were radiant blue
And all the landscape gold and green,
Where now is little to be seen
But lowering clouds and miry ruts —
The gods were niggard then, I ween,
Who mock us, toothless now, with nuts.
Once we’d incisors—molars, too—
To crack the toughest shells between;
Yet filberts then arrived but few,
Of Kentish cobs our share was lean.
Hazels and Spanish chestnuts, e’en,
They never, never came in gluts—
, A windfall rich they would have been —
But now, sans teeth, what use are nuts?
Gone are the ivories that could chew
The plump Brazil, the locust bean,
The almond with its creamy hue,
The pea they roast in a machine.
Truly the gods are full of spleen,
And for their sport they make us butts.
With jaws of grinders levered clean
What can a fellow do with nuts?
Visions that once had thrilled you through
Are thrown too late upon the screen
When failing sight and sense you rue
In Rupert Brooke’s “unhoped serene.”
Music that (harmed and thrilled yestreen
What is’t but gall when deafness shuts
The ears? Inimitably mean
These gods that send the toothless nuts!

“Mag” : Caterpillar plagues are common;
but a cat plague is something to meow about. The
’roo killers mentioned by me in a recent Bulletin,
when camped near Lake Buchanan, in N.-C.
Queensland, some years back, were deluged with
cats. Stray prospectors reported them 100 miles
west of the camp, and later they were seen 10(0
miles and more to the east. From somewhere in
the west they came; to nowhere in the east they
went—cats in thousands, tens of thousands; black,
brown, grey, rusty and tortoiseshell. Round the
skinned bodies of ’roos, at the first break of dawn,
scores would be found gorged beyond the power of
movement. They were shot and skinned in hundreds,
but as the skins brought only 6d. each the slaughter
was discontinued as unprofitable. Curiously, all
the cats were about the same size, and no preg-
nant female, or even a kitten, was present. Whence
they came and whither they went have remained a
mystery.

was to ask: “Would yer die of lock-jaw if y’ chop-
ped y’ foot, Dave?” “No, son,” returned the sweat-
ing David, “I’d die of shame.”

“Momokani” (Papua) : Has some mis-
guided Abo. said that black snake can’t be eaten?
A fortnight’s undiluted bullumacow had filled ns
with a yearning for a change, and so last night we
dined on long, juicy, milk-white steaks, cut from
the mid-ribs of several feet of sudden death. Fried
in boiling fat, with onion and chips as a side-line, it
tasted like pork chops rather —only nicer. Lucius
Conolly, boss of the 8.P.5.E., handled the rifle and
the frying-pan, and, as all good cooks should, sampled
the first mouthful of the experiment himself. We
now know what to do to our next carpet-snake.
“Buka Siput” : Tell “Pgrama” there’s no-
thing in the yarn (B. 26/4/’23) about pearls increas-
ing in size when locked up with rice for nourishment
in a bottle plugged with a dead man’s finger. The
only way to “grow” pearls is to introduce an irritant
into the tissue of the living oyster, and then the
chances are 10 to 1 against. On the boats I learnt
many ingenious methods of pearl-faking, but rice
never entered into the business—and we used to
almost, live on rice those days. I’ve held a few pearls
for a few months at a time, but none of ’em ever
added a cubit to their stature, though they had to be
exposed to sunlight once in a while to keep their
lustre and prevent them from “going dead.” If
“Parama,” on seeing those pearls kept so secretively
in little boxes and bottles, had named a figure in
hard cash, he would have found the owners quite will-
ing to forego indefinitely the pleasure and profit of
“breeding.”

“The Deacon”: “Condamine’s” prad (B.
31/5/’23) oan’t beat an old sulky mare on the
Macleay River (N.S.W.). She belonged at that
time to the P.M., and, something startling her one
day when standing in the street unattended, she lit
out with the sulky for home. The mere fact that
the Macleay River, nearly half-a-mile wide, was
in the way didn’t stop her. As gallantly as the
old-man rat in the Pied Piper swimming the Weser
she breasted the tide, landed the turnout on the
opposite bank, and carried on.
* * * *
“Azac”: The uncanny accuracy of some
men in judging weight as set out in recent pars,
is often equalled by the confidence with which they
register their guesses. One farmer complained
to the sec. of the R. A. Society at the last Sydney
Show that, after he had had a guess at the weight
of the bullock, he saw one of the attendants adding
more weight. “Yer might ’ave made it public vers
was goin’ to feed ’im,” remarked Cocky, “an’
then I could ’ave made some allowance fer it in
me guess.”
* * * *
“Cartot”: Residents of the Grafton
(N.S. v,.) district take a melancholy interest in
pointing out to strangers a house off one of the
main roads leading into the town as the site of the
introduction of the water-hyacinth, a curse which
has cost that part of the State a ton of money, and
is likely to cost several tons more. It was originaby
brought there by a man who, attracted by the
flower, placed the only plant he had in a tin pot
and gave it to his daughter to care for. So rapid
was it? growth that the lady cut some of it out
a few weeks afterwards and threw it into a near-by
creek. That creek has long since been choked up out
of sight. It is believed that the hyacinth came in the
first place from England, where its growth is innocu-
ously mild.
“Ento”: Tell “Country Red” he is a
bigger mug than “Mug-
ski ’ (B. 17/5/’23) if he
really believes the
grasshopper comes from
the egg as a perfect in-
sect. On first emerging
from the shell it has
nothing in common with
the adult but three
pairs of legs and mouth
parts. Even the thorax
is practically composed
o f simple . segments
which are not very dis-
similar to those of the
abdomen, and the true
differentiation does not
show until after the
first moult. Further
moults are necessary
before wings appear,
and these grow in
stages till the creature
is fully developed—the
so-called perfect insect.
The only difference be-
tween this primitive
metamorphosis and the
more complex one is
that in this case the
wings grow internally,
in the other externally
—the rest is a matter
of degree, and there
is really no difference
of a fundamental
nature. The most
highly-developed meta-
morphosis occurs among
many flies, whose head
also develops internally.
The head of the maggot
is virtually the neck of
the adult.

“Pat Bushie”: “The Rumpus’s” mocking
magpie (B. 10/5/’23) reminds me that close to the
railway station at Toronto (N.S.W.) is an African
parrot which can give excellent imitations of the
engine whistle and the guard’s whistle. Once he
started the train when a new driver was on.

“Numbugga” : My dam gave out this sum-
mer. It is an old brick excavation on the side of a
hill and has no connection with any other waters.
After it had been dry for five weeks the clay had
hardened and cracked across so freely that great
blocks could be lifted up. I'started cleaning out
this sediment with a scoop, and a foot below the
surface came on two eels, one over 3ft. and the
other 15in. long. Both were coiled horseshoe shape
and when lifted were very fat and very lively. The
clay in which they were embedded could be called
just damp. How long could these two wrigglers
have existed without food or water, and had they
just gone to sleep awaiting the arrival of better
times ?

“And what is the new baby, Mr. Slappy ?”

“Lou”: “Ringer’s” racehorse that couldn’t
head a half-grown emu (B. 17/5/’23) —even a corn-
fed bird—ought to be broken into harness. Any ordi-
nary station hack can race that half of the Aussie
coat-of-arms. I’ve run ’em down many times on
Cambridge Downs station (W.Q.). But not every
steed will go alongside the ungainly things. The other
half of the emblem is also an easy proposition if
you get one out on the downs ; excepting, of course,
the small blue female—but she, too, puts in her best
work where the gidya scrub is all in her favor.

"Jacaranda”: There’s a plentiful supply
of mosquitoes on most of the islands of the Pacific;
but in the good old head-hunting days some of the
principal places had none at all. On one occasion
the men from a small island visiting a larger one
remarked to their hosts that they always slept extra
well when they were there because they were not
disturbed, as they were on their own island, by a
little fly which bit them at night and kept waking
them up. The interested hosts promptly offered to
pay well if a few of the little flies were brought over
to them at the first opportunity. They argued that,
as their enemies always attacked them at night, if
the little fly could be imported, and would do its
work properly, they would be m6re alert and better
able to defend themselves. So, over a hundred miles
of ocean, some of the skeeters were safely trans-
ported, and a canoe and much native money were
paid for them. But what the niggers of to-day say
about that bargain made by their ancestors is a
shame.

“Red Guard”: “Caesar’s” record (B.
X7/5/’23) of the capless coach wheel is easily beaten.
In 1907 Bob Wright drove Cobb and Co.’s coach from
AugathelLa (Q.) to Nive Downs, a distance of
25 miles, minus a wheel cap. Also tell “Spenner”
(B. 17/5/’23) that a barber in Ipswich (Q.) milked
a shorthorn cow continuously for 13 years. She
used to flirt with Billum, but was apparently a
birth-control student.
* * * *
“Te Whare”: Cook is usually credited with
the discovery of the kangaroo in 1770 (he shot one
then), but Dampier first noticed the big hopper 71
years earier—in 1699. The buccaneering old navi-
gator spotted the ’roo on the north-west coast of
Australia, and described it as a “sort of racoon,
found on the islands in Shark Bay, and differing from
that of the West Indies chiefly about the legs.” He
was struck with the animal’s hopping capabilities and
its short forepaws. Tasman, however, just missed dis-
covering the ’roo in Van Diemen’s Land in 1642. He
apparently saw its tracks, but mistook them for those
of a tiger. Dampier may be credited, too, with rhe
discovery of the flathead, for when off the s.-e. coast
of Australia his crew took some flat fish “which we
called foxes.” The head of a flathead distinctly re-
calls that of a fox. These fish the old navigator voted
first chop and a welcome variant on salt pork.
“Jim Carew”: How does the Council dis-
tinguish the kangaroo-rat from the paddy-melon? I
can never tell which is which, and dozens of bush-
men who can distinguish them can’t explain how
they do it.
* * * *
“T.P.”; “Sarah Anne” (B. 24/5/’23) is
right concerning drunks and horses. Bill, a friend
of mine in the early ’seventies, rode a perfect devil
of a stallion. It was a work of time and art to get
astride, and then he
had to ride with a grip
every inch of the way,
for the fiend spent his
time thinking out and
practising every vice
under the sun. One
night Bill staggered out
from a pub with a
couple of bottles of
beer strapped to one
hand, and in the other
a string bag holding
some tins of salmon —a
peace-offering to the
missus. He unhitched
the stallion and
promptly fell over,
dragging the head of
the brute to the ground.
The animal’s front legs
were used to assist
William’s corkscrew up-
rising. For some
minutes the stirrup was
a Chinese puzzle, and
when at last the saddle
was reached, the sal-
mon, the Missus’s
solace, was dropped;
and off flopped Bill to
regain the parcel. As
we drew near the stal-
lion bared his teeth
and generally gave a
warning which we re-
spectfully observed,
leaving the fool to his
fate. Presently man
and mount disappeared
like a flash, 1 Bill
banging his steed
with beer, salmon and
legs alternately. When
they got to a slip-panel
William fell off, but
crawled on again, and-
eventually reached
home without a scratch.
The most curious thing
about the business was that when Bill, sober, went
tj> fraternise with the stallion next day, the brute
went mad.
“Murranji”: He was known as Silent Joe
as he could never be induced to unburden himself
of speech, and he drove a mail-coach for years in
the Burnett district (Q.). On one occasion he had
as a passenger a commercial who, after having tried
everything to make Joe talk, without success, re-
marked as they were passing a cultivation paddock:
“That’s a fine crop of lucerne, Joe.” Except to cast
his eyes over the stuff Joe paid no attention. On
the commercial’s next trip, about eight weeks later,
when they came abreast of the spot, Joe nudged him
and, pointing to the crop, said witheririgly, “Them’s
hoats, yer blanky fool.”
WHAT HE HAD ESCAPED.
RAFFERTY: “It's a noice thing has happened
to me. Th ’ ould woman’s just bin an’
had twins.”
PARSON : “It’s Nature’s way of restoring the
population. I read in a book yesterday
that towards the end of the tear cases
of twins became common in Germany.”
RAFFERTY: “CASES uv ’em! Oh, my lord!”
“Trevdee”: I’m sorry, but “El Dorado’s”
Cocky Brown (B. 24/5/’23) will have to give back
her booby prize for egg-laying, because a domesti-
cated brolga in N. Victoria lived in captivity for 25
years, and in all that time laid a solitary egg. She
can’t add to her tally, because after performing the
unusual feat she kicked up her claws and snuffed it.

JOIE DE VIVRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, it’s joy to ride at the break of day
On a good horse striding free,
With the east a glory of pink and grey,
And the bush scents luring us far away,
And the magpies singing their carols gay
In praise for the day to be.
And it’s joy to hold in his swinging stride
The good horse under me,
To sway with him as he springs aside
From the bird that seeks in the grass to hide,
While his spirit is mine through that
glorious ride
In triumphant mastery.

“Centurion” : “Kilwa’s” new version of the
teat-sucking snake (B. 24/5/’23) moves me to tears.
Nobody or nothing can suck without the tongue
and the labial muscles, with which mammals are
specially provided for the purpose. It is not possible
for any snake, without lips, cheek muscles or tongje
of the proper shape to suck anything-—an elementary
truth that any text-book on anatomy will elucidate.
The sucking snake, like the snake which slimes
before swallowing, and the kangarette that grows on
the teat, are all brothers, -and dwell only in the
country of the imagination.

“Hermes”: H. S. Gullett’s “A.I.F. in
Sinai and Palestine” gives the Australian horse
his due. “Chauvel’s command,” it says, “included
horses representing more countries and types than
even the men of many lands and races who rode
them. Australia’s walers... .were in this company
subjected to a searching comparative test. They
proved by common consent incomparably superior
to all their rivals, except, perhaps, the best of the
horses from the British Isles, which included a
number of valuable hunters and officers’ chargers.
They were all, or nearly all, got by thoroughbred
sires. During sustained operations on very short
rations of pure grain and no water over periods which
extended up to 70 hours —when horses of baser breeds
lost their courage and then their strength—the waler,
though famished and wasted, confined alert, brave.
As long as these horses had strength to stand they
carried their great 20-st.one loads jauntily and
proudly.”
“Dean”: Tell “Caesar” (B. 17/5/’23) that
just dampness doesn’t wholly account for blankets
attracting blowflies. I had a pair of new white
ones (they had never been used) packed away in
a perfectly dry cupboard, and they were attacked
by flies. It was in cold weather, too.
* * * *
“Ntimbugga” : When “Ezekiah” thought he
was feasting on lyre-bird eggs (B. 24/5/’23), found
four-a-time in the nest down on the South Coast
(N.S.W.), he was apparently eating the eggs of the
big swamp hawks. These hawks were once very
plentiful all along the coast, and their nests and
eggs were not very unlike those of the lyre-bird.
Owing to the similarity some of the old cockies at
times indulged in jokes at the expense of new
, hums. Meanwhile, plump for “Yarrum’s” version
of the solitary egg of the lyre-bird.
# • * •
“Sucre”: We sold the bull calf four months
ago to the local butcher, who took it away in his
cart. Ma was in the cultivation paddock, a mile
distant, gathering materials for the evening’s supply
of milk. At 5 o’clock she jogged home, and made
straight for the milking-yard. After sniffing around,
and mooing for 15 minutes, she disappeared. Next
morning I rode into the township, four miles away,
and called on the butcher. The cow was standing on
the footpath gazing into the shop window at the
remains of her son.
“Tauwarra” : It was New Year’s Eve, and
Scotty and his mate were camped in the Papuan
bush, hundreds of miles from the nearest pub. The
last bottle had been opened, and Scotty became senti-
mental. “Only think, mon,” he hiccoughed, “this
whusky came all the way frae Bonnie Seawtland!”
“Yairs,” agreed his mate, darkly, “an’ if somebody’d
only cut yer blanky throat, it’d go a lot. further.”
“Fire-Stick”: “Primer” (B. 10/5/’23)
says his best skins were got with a .22 Winchester.
Well, I’ve used nearly every rifle on sale, and I
reckon he must be either a fool or a flaming liar
to say that he can drop a kangaroo up to 100yds.
with a .22. I have fired six shots,.from a' .22 Win-
chester repeater into a dingo at the distance of 75
yards, and the bullets only pierced its hide, as we
found when my cobber brought it down with a .32.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: "Bendee’s” haystack, 264 ft.
long and 500 tons weight (B. 17/5/’23), is only a
bird's nest. A stack 150yds. long and containing
1300 tons was built at Riverton (S.A.) in 1915-16.
At the same time three more big stacks stood near
Gladstone railway station, one 600 tons, one 800
tons and the other 1000 tons. The thousand-tonner
was 250yds. in circumference, and all were well
built. These piles were among the “local sights,”
and were visited and measured and figured out by
directors and Ministers of Agriculture and other
interested gents.
“Ivenbir”: I don’t ' wish to start afresh
the old Abo. argument re the vocal powers of an
estuary crocodile (miscalled “alligator” by Northern
residents), but the Kendall-Birtles zoological expedi-
tion, of which I am a member, recently camped on the
Endeavour River, about 12 miles from Cooktown (Q.),
and we distinctly heard the cough-like bellow of one
saurian as it floated past.
The ultra-blanky bullocky is
surely dying out. There are nine teams hauling to
a N.S.W. North Coast sawmill, and it is a rarity to
hear the conductors use an adjective that would ruffle
the wowseriest whiskers. None of the teams has less
than a score of bullocks, and the tracks through
the bush would strain a saint’s vocabulary; yet the

hardest-pulling team is controlled by a swarthy Corn-
stalk who scarcely utters a word beyond “Whoa —
whoa back!” All the bullockies in that district
emphasise that they can get better work out of the
hornies with less blasphemy and less whip. Who’ll
explain the reason?

“Pantagruel”: The Bates that “Bill Bow-
yang” . mentions (B. 5/4/’23) as spaying 1800 cows
with 1 p.c. losses on the Bowen River (N.Q.) has
put up another slick performance, this time on a
Clermont station. He spayed 1212 cows altogether,
putting through 311 in one day. This was two
months ago, and not one death has been reported.
Bates now affects the title of “Professor.”
* * * *
“Centurion”: Tell “Yarrum” that the
reason the wild duck (B. 24/5/’£3) goes barer of
feathers than - the drake and is often too denuded
to fly is that the lady practically plucks herself bare
to furnish her nest, not only with a down mattress,
but with coverlet as well.
“Pick”: There’s rarely a half-way in
animal mentality. Cattle and horses are either
stolidly sane or rabidly
mad. But on Bib-
benluke station (N. S.
Wales) they had a bul-
lock that was comically
imbecile. Even hi s
facial expression was
clownishly grotesque,
and his every action
betokened a harmless
idiocy. He would
blunder aimlessly into
bogs or barbed-wire,-
or flounder into deep
water ; when driven, he
would stagger drunkenly
in the way of the stock-
horses, or leer around
foolishly, without kick
or-protest, when heeled
by the cattle-dogs. He
would follow' sheep in
preference to his herd,
and would approach a
traction-engine or other
unusual apparition on
the road with an air
of silly inquisitiveness
when all the other cattle
had galloped away in
terror. He ended up by
wandering into an acute-angled corner of a paddock,
and there starving to death with his fool head peer-
ing over the corner post.

“E.W.” : The ibis has become a great favor-
ite on the N.S.W. North Coast. When the bird
turned up here, years ago, it was prophesied that
another pest had come to Cockydom ; but the long-
legged chap has proved a reliable scavenger. His
tucker consists of locusts, caterpillars, crickets, and
any grub-meat that may be on offer. Furthermore,
there are to be found cockies who allege that the
ibis has done good work in checking the cattle-tick;
and many now do their best to keep him around the
place.

“.Tesmond”: Re “Herodot” on tlie poison
a dog can stand (B.
17/5/'23). Some years ago
I saw a Scotch terrier get
frisky on prussic acid. My
brother, a chemist, had
undertaken to destroy the
tyke for a lady customer,
but the job proved more
difficult than he had ex-
pected. Four increasing
doses, aggregating loz. of
the 2 per cent, solution —
enough to send 16 people
to Kingdom Come —were
fjiven with a tonic-like
effect. As my brother had
to deliver up a dead dog,
not a rejuvenated one, Fido
was ultimately despatched
per axe. The lady on call-
ing for her pet was advised
not to open the bag, as the
poison contorted the
muscles and made the re-
mains look ghastly.
* * *
“Para”: Someone
was talking a while ago
about exterminating Bunny
with dynamite. If he owns
a Tin Lizzie he can use her
breath on the same job
with much better effect.
Back the ’bus up to the
warren, and pbur about a
quart of oil into the
petrol; fix a length of hose
from the exhaust into a
burrow; start up the en-
gine, and as smoke begins
to appear from each open-
ing block it up. Not a
bunny in the dug-out will
live to tell his pals about
it or eat any more crop.
Contrary to the belief of
many cockies, the slaughter
should take place about
August, for, by eating the
young shoots down, the
rabbit helps to keep the wheat from growing rank.
* * * >:«
“Pick” on the language of the bush: —
When danger lurks, not only with their ground
rapping signals do animals give warning; many have
a language well understood in Bushland. When a.
sheep quietly grazing sees a dog, dingo or fox, he
emits a whistling snort, and immediately every
member of the flock rears an inquiring face. If a
man accompanies the intruder, a guttural bleat
assures all that there is no danger, and feeding is
resumed ; but a second whistle sends all the jumbucks
huddling together with half-ejaculated frightened
whimpers, and the cry of the ewes to their romping
lambs is singularly concerned and distressful. Crows
have a distinct note that announces the discovery of
a dead beast, another that foretells a change of
weather, and a “danm-you” scream of derision for
the man they see stealthily approaching with a
shooting-stick. With a falsetto whine, totally unlike
its customary flute-call, the magpie signals the pre-
sence of a fox. Many a hunter, profiting by the
warning, has circumvented a red prowler that other-
wise he would not have seen. Wild ducks a-wing
give calls that tell the practised gunman
whether they arc wheeling to settle on nearby
water or travelling to feeding-grounds afar.
Soldier-birds raise an unmistakable clamor when
they see a snake, and a sudden “gur-r-r”’ from

the coach-whip bird makes any lyre-bird, pigeon or
bush-quail vanish over the horizon. In the poultry
yard a drawling “squark” impels every bird to turn
one eye skyward for the hovering falcon. I have
known a boy who, by perfect mimicry of the sound,
could always induce the geese, turkeys and fowls to
strut about with their heads askew. Then, too, there
are the expert hunters who, by imitating the swamp-
hawk’s whistle, can make waterfowl cluster in circling
mobs amidstream, or with the wonga’s love-call can
bring dozens of the blueys cooing on the branches
overhead.
THE VICTORIOUS BUNNY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Logan drew a block by ballot
(He was crazy for the land) ;
It was mostly stony ridges
Interspersed with hills of sand.
There were rabbits there in thousands—
They had eaten every blade;
They had ringbarked all the bushes
And were resting in the shade.
He was young and optimistic,
Said he didn’t care a damn,
That he’d flood them in the winter,
And he’d poison them with jam.
So he brought his wife and baggage
(She was born and bred in town).
Set to work and built a humpy
And prepared to settle down.
Strong and snug, of rough bush timber,
Was the modest little shack,
With a sloping front verandah
And a skillion at the back.
Mrs. Logan loved the country
(She was optimistic too) ;
And they schemed and planned together
Of great things they meant to do.
There was plenty wood and water ;
They’d be never short of meat:
When they got their garden going
They’d grow more than they could eat.
Logan fed his stock on mulga
While his wife fed him on stew
Made of rabbits that he’d slaughtered
While the netting fence was new.
Soon the rain came down in torrents,
Starting herbage, grass and grain;
Late and early came the rabbits
Till the ground was bare again.
It was then that Logan started
Looking pale from loss of rest
As he grappled with devices
To exterminate the pest.
He tried arsenic and pollard, '
And he phosphorised some wheat,
Gave them sweetly-poisoned apples,
With some quinces for a treat.
Rabbits died beneath the kitchen,
Others tumbled down the well.
Spoiling all the drinking water—
And they couldn’t move the smell.
THE LOST YEARS.
THE OLD ONE: "Alas, I know what it is to
look back on the wasted years of a mis-
spent youth!”
THE YOUNG ONE: "How thrilling!”
THE OLD ONE: "Yes, I did not take up golf
until I was forty-five.”
Rabbits came in reinforcements
From the stations close at hand;
They cleaned up the kitchen garden,
Making sorties from the sand;
They burrowed through the pig-sty,
Dug their way beneath the shed ;
Then they ate the wheat and barley
Till the ground was bare and. red.
Game was Logan and undaunted
(He was always stout of heart).
He had tried a fumigator
And he bought a poison-cart,
Smoked the vermin in the burrows,
Burnt them hiding in the logs.
Sent and got a crate of ferrets
And a pack of hunting dogs.
Once he worked on Rodier’s system
By destroying only does—
That the bucks kill off the young ones
Is the way the theory goes.
Last the Pastures Board inspector
Came along and took a hand,
Summoned Logan for his failure
To kill rabbits on his land.
He had tried with poisoned water,
Also ploughed the warrens out;
But he always had them with him
Till they perished in the drought.
Then he felt a thrill of triumph,
And his hopes went soaring high—
He’d no trouble with the rabbits
While the drought was passing by.
Through long years he toiled and battled —
One by one lie saw them pass—
Always fighting with the rabbits
While there was a blade of grass.
Now his weary bones are resting
Where the shadeless mulgas wave,
While the rabbits skip and gambol,
In the evenings, on his grave.

The Education Gallery seethed with artis-
tic Sydney last week when the collection of
Australian pictures that are to gladden the
heart of London was opened to the pub-
lic by the Governor-General. The Society of
Artists was present in strong numbers.
President Sydney Ure Smith made straight
the path of the first Vice-r a gal gentleman of
the Continent, and afterwards lapsed into
a cheerful smile above grey tweeds. Then
Proctor, arty-looking as to frocking, handed
a huge posy of yellowish roses and carna-
tions to Lady Forster, who covered grey
frocking with the blue plush cloak in which
she made such a hit at the races. The Hans
Heysen couple were among the visitors, and
Penleigh Boyd, who is chaperoning a house-
ful! of English art in Australia, arrived in
time to see and be seen—his swift glance
never rested on any one object for a full
second. Penleigh, by the way, says that
Hugh D. Mclntosh got together the financial
sinews for the show of English work in Aus-
tralia. Dr. Floyd Williams, of U.S.A., wore
eye-arresting tailorings, all gold and black
stripes like a wasp; Owen Cox was there,
failing to be cheered by anything on the
walls; the Jack Lindsay couple wandered in
late, and Barbara Knox. The Kelly chick,
enveloped in a white fur cape that made her
look like a snow-girl, accompanied mother,
who was swathed like a Spanish dancer in
a fur wrap that ended in fringe so deep and
heavy that it whipped and snapped about
her knees like the locks of Medusa.
Lady Forster hurried on from the Art
Show to open the Welfare liooms at
Anthony Horderns’. Here when she arrived
she found the new entertainment hall full of
guests and members of the staff waiting for
the official baptism. Sam Hordern and his
lady and the newly-knighted Denison couple
rallied around her on the stage; and after
listening to a circumstantial story of the
welfare work of the firm, the vice-regal
lady, in her arms another cluster of roses,
said her say—it boiled down to “Take a
pride in the work nearest to your hand.”
Hut the Psalmist who tells us something
about lifting our eyes to the hills suits the
Australian temperament better. Everybody
on the stage burst into a psean of praise
about his neighbor, and at the very end
S’Sam himself stood up and very simply
and sincerely thanked the workers for what
they had done to build up the business. They
could never do better, he said, because they
had always done their best. After that only
the Hallelujah Chorus would have seemed
to fit the occasion. The new department is
built and fitted on a lavish scale. There’s
been no saving of hapoths of tar in this
bewildering array of rest-rooms, reading-
rooms, ward rooms, dispensaries and kit-
chens ; even a rifle-range. And miles of
shining lockers—a separate one for every
employee. But, of course, the gem of the
lot in the eyes of the young things is the
immense concert hall, with its dancing floor,
which same made its debut that very night
when the staff flew into a jazz of jubilation.
The Dickens Fellowship blossomed into its
first dance at the Oxford Hall a night or
two ago. Its object was to hand a cheque
to the Children’s Hospital, and, judging by
the crowded room, secretary Moss will have
another smile to go on with. The Oxford
Hall lends itself to a Dickens dance. You
turn into a pasage from Oxford-street, drop
down a flight of stone steps, cross a small
asphalt courtyard and so come to the hall
that was thronged the other evening with
little ladies in poke bonnets and fichus and
bunchy skirts, by young men in tail coats,
white breeches and tall hats, by elderly
gentlemen who rattled fobs and looked as
if their chests had slipped below their waists.
Sergeant Buzfuz was there, and a very-
dashing Sam Teller danced all the evening
with Dolly Varden. Dick Swiveller didn’t
seem a bit depressed because the little Mar-
chioness was absent; for some inscrutable
reason Barkis didn’t accompany Peggoty;
and, Mr. Dornbey being away, Mr. Carker
escorted the handsome Mrs. Dombey. Cor-
nelia Blimber wore her cap and gown; and
a nice Nicholls youth made a soft-eyed
young David Copperfield, so young that he
hadn’t even begun to think of writing for the
newspapers. A special vote of thanks should
go to secretary Kathleen O’Brien for organis-
ing the flutter.
Even the wintry- blast that swooped down
on Sydney midway through last week failed
to keep clusters of young things away from
St. Paul’s dance, and the open-air jazz door
proved just as popular as in former years,
for it supplies an awf’ly good excuse for
seeking the firelit rooms within the College
walls. Streamers of red and gold, a heavy
crop of Chinese lanterns and lots of bunting
formed a gay background against which the
Warden Garnsey couple received their guests
—she in gold tissue over vellum brocade,
while soft pale pink enveloped the Garnsey
girleen Joan.
St. Andrew’s (within the Uni.) provided
another foot-warming interlude to students
and ex-students during the week. The big
dining-room at Sandy’s is always used as
the ballroom, and here the College colors,
pale blue and white, coquetted with golden
Iceland poppies and masses of green garden
stuff. Present Principal Dr. Anderson, Mrs.
Anderson being away nursing the übiquitous
cold, was helped in the welcome handshaking
by Mrs. Harper, wife of a former principal.
The old Newingtonians, who had sent out
a marvellous beast summoning their guests
to the annual feast at the Wentworth, had
a great roll-up—the Wyvern isn’t the kind
of animal you’d like to make an enemy of;
and when he thrusts a dagger-edged tongue
at you while you are unsuspectingly opening
your mail, your promptest inclination is to
say soothingly: “Certainly, old chap, de-
lighted !’’ President of the committee Colonel
Warden brought a rose-and-silver brocaded
wife; and secretai-ies Cadogen and Wilson
felt the ineffable peace of a great success.
Sargents’ ballroom harbored the gayest
party of the week-end. Hundreds of children,
disguised as Oriental queens, brigands, Bo-
Peeps, Captain Bloods, Applejacks, Torea-
dors, Dora Copperfields, powder-puffs and
lamp-shades, fluttered into the pretty white
room sharp to the tick of 2.30, and lingered
till the last possible minute—lingered till
every balloon had burst and the pumpkin
pull pie was in extremis. The takings went
to the Children’s Hospital, and Mrs. Monty
Severn was the organiser. Mrs. Alex. Gor-
don, who brought daughter Anne and a covey
of young things, helped Mrs. Brady in award-
ing prizes for the various costumes. A popu-
lar win was that of Nelson with his be-
patched eye; /nd a sturdy John Bull was
another who got a loud glad eye from the
onlookers. Two Connolly children, who
might have gone as an advertisement for a
hair restorer, so luxuriant and glossy were
their locks, represented daffodils: and two
little lasses, one dressed as Winter, followed
closely by a dancing sprite in gold and green,
represented “If Winter Comes.” A small
Belly boy might have’been heir of Glamis
Castle, a troubadour, or Mary of Scots’
faithful page—it was a picturesque get-
up. But the perfect darling of the after-
noon, though she wasn’t mentioned in the
prize list, was a gazelle-eyed, silken-haired
girleen who represented a pensively sad
flower-seller.
Make your curtsey to the lady of Aus-
tralia’s Governor-General. She deserves
more than a
e o n v entional
bob. Wherever
she goes she
takes the gift
of making her-
self instantly
popular.
Even society
commit tees
working for
Charity 1o v e
her; and to
more than that
an archangel
could not at-
tain. At pre-
sent she is
putting the
Admiralty
House push be-
hind the Art-
ists’ Ball, and
is president of
the committee.
Music and Art are her two pet studies.
Lady Forster hostessed the first meeting
of the committee at Admiralty House on
Tuesday of this week; and it attacked the
two big problems of music and supper with
serious faces. Finally, the Denison lady
offered to put up the money for the band;
and the final convulsion over a supper esti-
mate of 3s. fid. without ices, or 3s. 9d. with
ices, was soothed by a resolution to go
further into the matter. Mrs. Bertie Kelly,
Mrs. Alexander Gordon, Mrs. Victor White
and Mrs. Albert Littlejohn hold commissions
on the staff of Lady Forster’s helpers.
(N.B. —But where were the artists?)
The swishest party of the week was the
wedding feast, partaken of by Sydney’s two
hundred, at Gladswood, the Spencer Brun-
ton home at Double Bay, following on son
John’s marriage with Jocelyn, the pretty
girleen of the Howard Joselands, of Potts
Point. St. James’s was the scene of the
heavily choral ceremony; and probably the
pews, white-favored and bepalmed, had never
seated a more gilt-edged and richly-uphol-
stered crowd._ Undaunted by the hundreds
of eyes watching her progress, the bride, her
ivory satin cut in the Greek profile, steamed
slowly up the aisle, piloted by white-surpliced
choristers, and drawing in her wake a froth
of georgette train that had silver tissue for
its foundation and velvet embossings for its
embellishment. Ruth Morton, the bride’s
cousin, bridegroom’s sister Evelyn and Daisy
Carter bridesmaided in heavenly blue velvet.
They wore wreaths of autumn leaves and
silver that drifted off into autumn-red stream-
ers ballasted by tiny posies.
Roy Agnew’s Testimonial Concert on
June 30, in Sydney Town Hall, will be the
fashionable send-off of the year. The G.-G.
and his lady have promised to be present,
and their
goo d-looking
daughter, the
Hon. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers (whose
photograph
smiles at you
here), is going
to sing two
songs of her
own composi-
tion—one the
delightful
“Trois Fem-
mes,” first sung
in Sydney by
Melba. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers is
a genuine lover
of music, and
she is as inter-
ested in the
result of Roy’s
concert as
though her
own success depended on it. Monte Luke
made the picture.
Roy Agnew, who has labored for years
at his music-writing, with the jacaranda
tree outside his own window as his most
sympathetic listener, hardly realises yet the
size of the audience that will listen to his
farewell to Sydney. Mrs. Alexander Gor-
don, who holds first place in Sydney as an
organiser of such events, and secretary Ruth
Barton have got together a perfectly stag-
gering list of artists, and made Sassiety
realise that it simply must have a little
money on this Australian winner.
On July 6 the Junior Red Crossers take
possession of the Town Hall for an exhibi-
tion of their year’s work in the interests of
Billjim’s orphan. There will be a fancy-
dress pageant, too, in which the good little
girls will revel as joyously as any baby
butterfly who never stitches at all. Her
State Ex., president of the Junior Red Cross,
will open the exhibition, and the G.-G.’s lady
has promised to give the glad eye to the
evening’s pageant.
The Girl Guides and the Boy Scouts are
to benefit by an Egyptian Ball in the Town
Hall on July 30; and if you can judge by
the size of the meeting at Government House
the other morning it will outdo all other
flutters of the season as a money-spinner.
Capable Mrs. Albert Littlejohn is one of the
principal workers, and she has also offered a
prize for the best Egyptian costume. Dame
Margaret, as Chief Girl Guide of the State,
is giving something for the best set of eight;
there’s to be a prize for the Queen of Sheba ;
Mrs. Tony Hordern offered to foot the bill
for the hall expenses; so the only nut left
to crack has the musicians’ fee for a kernel.
Of the next two plays by the Repertory
Society one will be by old friend Elizabeth
Baker, “Alf’s Girl,” in which Doris Fitton
will play lead ; the other will be “Pygmalion,”
with Mrs. Pitt Rivers as star. When that
time comes won’t there be a stampede of
Sydney’s best and near-best to hear how
Government House beefs out the Digger’s
favorite adjective!
The Romantic, ignoring her past, dabbed
her nose with a fresh powder-puff and set
sail once more on Saturday night. She
was all buttoned up and fastened down
against the wintry night, so that dancing
on her deck was just as cosy as in a Point
Piper ballroom. And if any man feared
thp chilly blast he had only to stretch out
a hand and pluck his particular growth of
cocktail from a passing waiter. The supper
was a lavish affair, and champagne bottles
the principal decoration of the tables.
Hosts of young things took up most of the
deck space, and Gordon Wesche and Lachlan
Beaton kept a fatherly eye over all. The
Romantic has passed into the care of Sep-
pelts.
Cupid seems to have found a possy to his
liking in the firm of Allen, Allen and Hems-
ley. His latest dart into the legal strong-
hold has pierced the heart of blue-eyed Dun-
das Allen, who has just gained the promise
of Mrs. Monty Stephen to take him and his
few weeks old partnership for better or
worse in about two months’ time. The bride-
to-be is a Maorilander, whose first husband
died a few weeks after the marriage from a
chill caught during the honeymoon—which,
by a trick of coincidence, was spent at the
Arthur Allens’ Port Hacking cottage.
An engagement that is interesting New-
castle and Maitland is that of Mrs. Atkin,
widow of Newcastle’s late Police Magistrate.
The ’groom-to-be is well-known dentist Percy
Cohen. The lady, besides being heavily
gilded, has a collection of priceless old china
and crystal.
Lord Lascelles’s cousin, Francis Orlando
Bridgeman, who married a London typist
last week, is a brother of the man who a
few months ago married Lord Dudley’s eldest
girl, Lady Honor Ward. They belong to a
Bradford family, every male member of
which is named Orlando. Lord Lascelles’s
mother was Lady Florence Bridgeman.
Pianist Teddy Cahill and tenor George
Brooke have reached London, and have
already met so many strawberry leaves that
their visiting list reads like a young Debrett.
The Hon. Mrs. Edwards and Mrs. Labou-
chere set the ball rolling by giving two recep-
tions in their honor; to which came the
Duchess of St. Albans, Lady Dawkins (she’s
a lady-in-waiting to the Queen), Viscountess
Novar (Australia’s own Lauy Helen Munro-
Ferguson) and a long list of lesser titles.
They saw the Royal wedding from Lady
Herbert’s house in The Mall; and Genee’s
home in Regent Park is one of their frequent
places of call.
Twice a day now the air ’bus leaves
London for Paris; but it is a longer flight
to Holland, and the other morning, when
May and Amy Macleod, of Mosman, climbed
aboard there was only one other passenger.
It’s two hours and some minutes from Croy-
don to Rotterdam, taking in Dover, Calais,
Dunkirk, Zeebrugge and Flushing on the
wing, as it were. Everywhere Spring was
on the land; rivers flashed by like lithe,
twisting whips; flocks of sheep were crumbs
of bread on an emerald carpet. But it is
not all joy for everybody; a “bad crossing”
can have terrors as keen if not so protracted
as one by boat. And, queerly, it is gener-
ally the stuffiness of the cabin that is blamed.
The Mosman girls’ Dutch headquarters were
at Scheveningen—they almost gasped to find
the Hotel Clarence run by two Maoriland
women.
S’African journalist Mrs. Julia Stansfield,
who left by the Makura last trip after a
rush visit to Lismore, said she found the
Northern Rivers a Garden of Eden except
for the domestic-labor problem. She thinks
S’Africa has its advantages, after all. By
the way, old Newcastle and Westralian jour-
nalist George Kingswell was her first editor
in Jo’burg, and not so long ago was first
mover to secure her the interest in the paper
which now constitutes her income. When
she first went to interview him she found
a man in his shirt sleeves who “swore a good
deal, and stammered a good deal, and had
the most cheerful grin in the world.” Who
recognises the picture?
On Saturday G.-G. Forster followed both
morning and evening rounds of the “goff”
championship, and was rapturous over the
day’s exercise. His habit of leaning cross-
legged on his cane may yet become a seri-
ous fashion. Gov. Davidson and Dame
joined the howling crowd in a baseball fix-
ture in Suburbia. S’Wally, who has done
most things a man can do on this planet,
has now attended all sorts of sports except
a fan-tan stance and a two-up school —and
it’s a million to one he’ll give them a fly be-
fore he’s finished.
A Brisbane postscript
The Governor has handed the British War General
Service medal to Mrs. P. G. Grant (wife of a one-
time Northern P.M.), in memory of her daughter
Lydia, who went to England to do military hos-
pital work and died while there. The late Denny
Day’s son married a sister, and she and her husband
were present with the dead girl’s parents at the
ceremony.
Sir Matt went to the races to see the Stradbroke
Handicap. Michael Rogers and Harry Hammond
formed a flank guard, and the committee lunched
them all. Later his Ex. ordered tea for a squad
that included Wyndham, M.P., the Duckett Whites,
Tullys, Whittinghams, Glyn Connollys, Cooehin
Bells, Watts (Sydney), Kirwans, Ernest Baynes and
a flock of young society birds.
Benno Moiseiwitsch supped at Government House
the other night with the Whittinghams, the E. J.
Watts, Mrs. George Sampson and Frank Hewson
of Tallyrand. Sir Matt has now gone north to
sample the mildness of the w'inter there.
Priminister Bruce and his lady had a lunch
spread for them at the Hotel Daniell the other
day by the Queensland Press Institute. New
president Edwards and his pretty wife gave the hand
of welcome to the visitors, she in a coat frock of
navy trimmed with jet broideries, under a silver tissue
hat. Mrs. Bruce was in black charmante, topped
with a white fur cape and black plush hat. The
Spencer Brownes, P. J. Leahy, the Tom Heneys,
Percy Reay (who has just joined the Daily Mail
staff), the C. E. Sligos, W. H. Smith, the Felsteads.
M. Forrest and G. A. Collat'd were among the
eaters.
From there a number of the lunchers passed to a
reception given to Allan Wilkie by the Brisbane
Shakspeare Society in the Wattle Cafe. Besides the
big actor there were Miss Hunter-Watts, Miss Forbes
and Cyril Monk.
Roses surrounded the crowd assembled by the
order of the Women’s Electoral League to hear
Priminister Bruce address them from the background
of Rowe’s Cafe. Subsequently the Federal man’s
party fled towards Toowoomba.
Margaret Dale and Gladys Pott were lured to the
depths of the Y.W.C.A. rooms by the National
Council of Women, who poured tea and compliments
before the visitors. Prior to this the executive com-
mittee of the Women’s Electoral League had roped
them in for an afternoon in the Gardens kiosk,
where teapots steamed among red roses.

• lt' n ty of Melbourne people are interested
m the election of Mabel Russell, the comedy
actress, to the House of Commons, because
her sister-in-law, Marie Hall, is a Bendigo
m•• Mabel’s husband, the Hon. Hilton
l lullipson, is a much-moneyed person, and
m Mabel he married an exceptionally clever
woman. Her maiden name was Shepherd,
and it was her brother, Billy Shepherd, a
flying captain, who married pretty Marie
Hall during the war. Marie’s mamma is
Susie Hall, one of the J. B. Watson million-
aire family. Malcolm MacEacharn’s widow
is eldest sister. In the war-days Cap-
tain Shepherd was sent to Washington to
teach the Yanks to fly, and he took his wife
with him. Nowadays he. represents a big
firm of dental manufacturers.
The Broughton Allards’ elder hope, Keith,
and Constance de Berigny, whose late father
was attached to the Imperial Customs in China,
were wedded by Father O’Dwyer, rector of
Xavier, in the parlor at No. 9 Darling-
street the other night. Dr. Barry Thomp-
son handed over the bride, whose white satin
swathmgs, with a back curtain of silver
tissue, was clamped at the hip-line with
silver leaves, while more leaves with side
knots of orange blossom anchored her bridal
tulle. Audrey Kimpton bridesmaided in
apple green crepe, gathered together at one
side with what looked like green and silver
peonies. An infant, Eve Symons, in similar
greenness, held the tail-piece aloft. Geoff
Stephens guarded the bridegroom. Mrs. de
Berigny, in cinnamon marocain, overset with
bronze beads, hostessed the usual health-
drmkmg. Among the guests were the Willie
Wei gal Is and their two daughters, the Arthur
Baillieu matron, John Fuller and his chick
I hylhs, Symons, V.C., Mrs. Geoff Syme and
daughter Mardi, and the De Bavay sisters.
Charles Austin, wee George Harris and
our own little Borna and Toots Founds are
to begin starring in the next Fuller-Ward
show just when “The O’Brien Girl” is finish-
it* second century, so the management
celebrated the double event with an
after-the-show party in three acts. The open-
ing scene was in the foyer of the Princess’s
iheatre, where host Hugh avelcomed the
guests, with John Fuller in the offing, while
Mrs. Hugh, in golden bronze tissue and filmy
black-and-gold veilings, smiled approval from
a neighboring armchair. Phyllis Fuller, in
brown velvet, hovered under the wing of an
auntie, who struck an effective golden note
in brocaded tissue. Toots and Lorna got a
rousing reception, the one in pink 'raped geor-
gette pleatings and the other in blue, while
Mamma Pounds beamed from an ermine wrap.
Mrs. Austin was in shimmering green and
silver draperies.
The Second act was a jazz on.the stage.
Mamie Watson O’Brien, fluttering delicately
like a mauve orchid, was the centre of attrac-
tion, with June Roberts in pink suggesting
a newly-opened rose. Some rude scenery
had that night bumped the head of Lady
Forbes Robertson, so she was a non-starter,
but daughter Anne McLean came along with
Lilias Waldegrave. Eve Grey, all white
georgette and iridescent glitter, looked like
her prize-winning beauty photo as she
chatted with Mulcaster of “The Faithful
Heart” in the dress-circle. Sylvia Shaw
Ethel Morrison and Beryl Bryant featured
rival designs m black velvet. Diana Wilson
who had not lifted her make-up, was en-
cased in black. Julius Superbus, Mark
Daly, Ireland Cutter, George Bejlamy,
lengthy Neville Towne, Ashton Jarry and
Cronin Wilson all gathered around; and
Edmund Jowett added to his long string of
scalps the proud claim that he was opce a
stage-dancer. May Beatty snuggled into a
stage-box with some pals: tired out with an
overdose of rehearsal, frock-selecting and
the breathless moment, piled on top of little
daughter Bunny’s outbreak of measles. The
final scene was a supper in a scene-dock
set as a dining-parlor. George Smith, Percy
Crawford and Julius Grant, with Frank
Talbot, who will shortly launch a new
comedy-theatre on the ashes of the old
Athenamm Hall, represented rival manage-
ments.
In the Wilson Hall the other night the
students of Queen’s College gave a ball
which was camouflaged as an at-home,
-the fact that there was to be dancing was
not to be mentioned under pain of awful
penalties. It was really quite a swagger
hop, too, with the best of jazz mus ; c, lots of
pretty girls wrapped in unusually lovely
frocks, and plenty of young hosts to give
them a good time. But Qtteren’s College re-
presents a church with a conscience which
absolutely forbade any such unseemly fri-
volity as dancing in the past, and still frowns
upon it officially. So—mum’s the word. To
have called the shivoo a ball would have
been inviting the roof to fall in. The master
of Queen’s lent his presence and his smile,
but he wasn’t supposed to be visible. Whether
he was supposed to be or not, Chancellor John
Macfarland was very viable, and popped in
and out like the cheeriest of jacks-in-the-box.
The Bremner Lewis matron- —she was a
Warrnambool Anderson —had a farewell
gathering at the Alexandra Club the other
afternoon; she is tripping off with her hus-
band for a year. It was tea-and-talk bright-
ened by some musical moments supplied
by Alice Spowers, Marie Bremner and Louie
Ililburn. The hostess was in brown velvet,
with a mammoth bow on her shady hat-brim.
It was qufte a smart affair, and one got the
idea that everyone had turned out in her
newest and most expensive togs. Mrs. Ken-
neth Buchanan (one-time Muriel Gumming),
who helped to decorate the guest list, was
magnetic in black silk. She has been clois-
tered since landing back in Australia owing
to some measles getting mixed up with her
two small daughters. Her elder sister, tlje
Grey-Egerton lady, and her baronet husband
have just come in for a golden windfall from
an Egerton uncle, and are thinking of re-
trieving the family hereditary acreage, Out-
top Park, near Chester, which has been hired
out for umpteen years.
Hugh Ward inveigled many people earlier
than usual into the Princess’s on Saturday
with the far-flung announcement that
the performance would commence at
7.40 sharp. Perhaps it did. All
the same, it was nearly 8 before the
curtain went up. The preliminaries con-
sisted of deep obeisances and salutations be-
tween the management and its latest cap-
tures for the “Rockets” revue. First Hugh
Ward escorted the Pounds sistern with
mamma to a box, an enterprise that brought
forth expressions of delight from the gallery,-
ites. Then followed the comedian Austin,
his wife and wee Georgie Harris, with more
bendings by the manager and more row from
thp gallery. Having deposited them safely,
the entrepreneur went to his own box, where,
to his astonishment, he was recognised by the
house, and was once more overcome by the
demonstration. After he was seated 'John
Fuller sailed into his box, and, surprised
to find his partner in the neighboring pen,
without more ado got up and shook him
nobly by the hand—-amid more applause. It
was a great entertainment, and not the least
feature of it was its unassuming spon-
taneity.
A beautiful bride and bridesmaid, with
bridegroom and groomsman, puffing cigar-
ettes round a small table at the marriage
feast, rather shocked those of the old regime
present at the Keith Allard-Connie de Ber-
igny_ wedding last week. But this uncon-
ventional bride and bridegroom further out-
raged all Victorian proprieties by turning
up the next night at the dance on the stage
of the Princess’s Theatre, and —would you
believe it, m’dear?—actually talcing part in
the frivollings.
This is Shier’s likeness of artist Clarice
Beckett, who is holding her first show of pic-
tures at the Athenaeum, and is modestly blush-
ing for her
temerity. Yet
Max Meldrum
approves o f
her dash into
the limelight,
and generously
declares her
his most pro-
mising pupil—
a compliment
of great value
to the young
painter, though
she refuses
to exploit it
for advertising
purposes. She
is content to
set down
aspects of
Nature as she
sees them with
uncompromis-
ing sincerity,
and let her work speak for itself. .Before
she fluttered into the Meldrum camp, she
battled through the drawing school of the
•National Gallery and won a prize for the
antique. She has been represented in two
or three of the Vic. Artists’ exhibitions,
and treasures the fact that a still life of
hers caught The Bulletin’s eye in the
days when words of encouragement were
scarcer than they are now.
At the Children’s Hospital recently Dr.
Sutherland unveiled a memorial to an ex-
trainee, Sister Beatrice Watson, who died
on active service in Egypt in 1916. She was
the younger daughter of the late W. G. Wat-
son, Dalgety’s confidential adviser, a hand-
some girl and an efficient nurse, who had
endeared herself to patients and co-workers
alike.
Robert Blackwood, who is a grass-widower
while his wife is taking- another dose of
European travel with her chum, Dr. Helen
Sexton, hurriedly called off the dinner he
was preparing for the Arthur Stanleys owing
to his brother George becoming suddenly ill
just as he and Mrs. George were packing to
take the latter’s younger Russell daughter
to the Cold Land on the Euripides for more
education. The invalid, however, is now
forging ahead, and hopes to steam off before
the London fogs veil the landscape. Mrs
George s elder chick, Joyce Russell, is one
pi the big group of Aussies who will do their
bobbing at- one or other of the Spring Courts.

“Tangerine,” which deposed the 200-
nights-old “O’Brien Girl” at the Prin-
cess s on Saturday night, is gorgeously
dressed. _ Mamie Watson’s slim attrac-
tiveness is best catered for by a saint-
like grey frock revealing a worldly touch
m the rose-red lining of a back shoulder-
cape. _ Then she sports a sleeveless jumper
dress in tender yellow which will inspire a
flapper following, and she dances in a sunset
georgette petalled skirt, knee-length, with a
straight-jacket bodice effect above. June
Roberts opens up as a distant vision in a
pink silky nightie, then twirls in a rosy short
skirt silvefed like a moonbeam, and later
affects tender green silk with silver-flecked
overpanellings before bursting forth in some
Tutankhamen-inspired toggery. May Beatty’s
first covering is the side of a bath-tub which
veils her suggested nakedness below the
and a pair of black-rimmed specs,
ihen she climbs into a pale skirt billowing
under fierce blue and white stripes, with a
gem hat perched atop of her thatch. Her
next rig buttresses a front panel of red silk
below a red-silk basqued jacket; and finally
she. is arrayed in golden drapings with a
oash of strong coloring and loud-striped
effects which stand for Egyptianism. The
house was. packed with the 'best-dressed
audience this young city has seen since the
war. Apparently our brightest bachelor
men had recklessly booked out half the stalls,
and hundreds more would have been there
but could pot fit in.
At one little shivoo to the visiting State

Hayes, of the Speck, isaid Maci. did it
more neatly than the agricultural show
president in his State who, desiring to be
brief, gave the loyal toast this way: “The
King, gents; the less said the better.”

Country Ped.’s” little testimonial:—
Writing- of a Victoria League function, Mel-
bourne Chatterer (B. 31/5/’23) says: “It was a
rightfully swish affair—these League things always
are.” These reception and farewell shivoos of the
League get the limelight, but its less specta-
cular activities, though they do far more good, are
seldom mentioned. What country teacher would
not pay more than a shilling annually to get a big
.yearly parcel of illustrated magazines for the young-
sters and a library of 25 books into the bargain?
That is what the Victoria League is doing for the
little country schools in the State. It also sends
out books to isolated residents, after the style of
the Bush Book Club of Sydney. These phases of the
League s doings have helped me in my profession,
and I am grateful. If they were advertised more I
am convinced the League would get more public
support.
The demon ’flu waylaid Maud Fane
just before her announced last-night
at Her Majesty’s on Friday, and bright
little Floie Allan, who twinkled notice-
ably in "The Peep Show” some time
back, stepped into the vacancy. The
huge house that came to shower vegeta-
tion on Maud accepted the emergency in good
spirit, and at the end was so pleased with
j 1 loie that the plump maiden was cheered
frantically and asked for a speech. Maud
Fane had tried gallantly to overcome a tem-
perature in order to be present, and had even
got into a taxi to go to the theatre, but had
to return disconsolately to bed.
An amateur movie will be screened at the
Lown Hall on June 28 to swell the Women’s
Hospital funds. Not such a social thriller
as the Red Cross film arranged by ex-Gent.-
Help Conant, perhaps, but quite a society
item. Ray Whiting is responsible for the
story, which opens up in the Andrew
McHargs homestead and dashes along the
Alexandra-avenue and therafter to Sand-
ringham, with an interlude at the Tom
1 atbrsons’ swimming-bath. The thing is
called “The Twins,” and the author will step
round as one twin, with Jim Paxton as his
double. Aubrey Gibson will do the villain-
ing, and Doreen, daughter of Parliamentary
Clerk Gale, will be the vamp lady.
Some Adelaide gossip :
Hunting men—and women—had the time of their
lives on the holiday, when for once they tucked them-
selves and their horses into the train for Two Wells
and went truly fox-hunting. It was a day of rain
and wind, but even the storm couldn’t quench the
enthusiasm of hounds and riders. There was a big
field out (some of it grey-haired, lured by the chance
of a fox after a lapse of years), and among the
feminine followers were the R. A. Sanders, A. M.
1011, R. M. Cudmore and J. Harvey matrons. After
two foxes had been successfully run.—the brushes
going to Mrs. Toll and George Braund—there were
meat and drink at Buckland Park and a warm wel-
come from the E. A. Brookses.
The McKail lectures at the ’Varsity have been
adding to Adelaide’s wisdom. Members of the Classi-
cal Association were bidden to tea with the lecturer
and his wife, the Darnley Naylors being host and host-
ess, and there was also a Chancellor’s reception in their
honor in the Eider Hall. At this festivity there
were talk, supper and a brief musical programme
supplied by Hilda Gill, Gerald Walenn (just back
from England), Harold Wylde and William Silver.
The guests were mostly University, Bar and Educa-
tion. Mrs. McKail, slim and petite in nattier blue,
has a look that befits Burne-Jones’s daughter; and
he is slim, too—grey-haired, gentle of voice, and
with the kindliest, most whimsical eyes. Since his
arrival he has added to his possessions a copy of
lhe Art of Hans Heysen”—presented by the Classi-
cal Association at the Naylors’ tea-party.
Miss Phoebe Watson, who has long been sec. to
the Women Teachers’ Association, has had to pass
in her resignation, thanks to a move-up to another
branch of the Education Department. A big meeting
of women teachers handed hei' a wristlet watch and
fitted dressing-case the other evening.
Coats and umbrellas were the things chiefly visible
at the races—the former mostly of thb utilitarian
variety, though there were a few voluptuous fur gar-
ments. Lawns and saddling-paddock were a bog
that reduced shoes to pulp; but the feminine race-
goer was there in bulk, as usual. The Bridges
brought Mrs. Medley with them, and there was a fair
sprinkling of country visitors.
The Darcy Addisons are here on a brief visit from
Tasmania at least his visit is brief, but she (the
Downer lady aS f was) will stay on for some of the
winter. She was bidden to meet some of her old
friends at the Queen Adelaide Club a few days after
her arrival, with Mrs. Kenneth Bakewell and Mrs.
Lisle Johnson as joint host?sscs.
The annual ball of the Girton House Old Scholars’
Association at the Osborne Hall went with a cheerful
swing. The small committee that ran the show
included Isobel Ritchie, Margaret Scott Young,
Laurel Laurence, Maisie Morris, Inez Robin and
Gwen Colquhoun. The hoppers were mostly of the
youngest set, among them Mrs. Bill Hope Murray,
one of our most recent brides, who was Joyce Wald'
in her school days.

Wien you’re putting on Silk Stockings
do you ever think op this ?
Hundreds of times m a year probably, you put on a pair of Silk Stockings. In all likelihood you will be putting
on a pair to-morrow morning Yet have you ever thought in the past, and will you think to-morrow morning of
the story that is woven into the production of a pair of Silk Stockings ? Did you ever pause to consider who
made them, where they were made, or give due appreciation to the significance of the human effort and
the vast expenditure of money needed to bring that pair of Silk Stockings into your hands?
&Slr)r!
Okr'-Vi.
Would you ever think that a pair of Silk Hose could actually be
an item of National importance—a factor that is playing its part
in shaping your destiny and that of Jlustralia ?
Yet, the facts of the case justify such a statement facts that
are well worthy of your thought TO-MORROW MORNING.

Sells everywhere, in all

If I hose Silk Stockings you will be putting on are Australian-made it means that the money you paid
for them is being used almost wholly for the benefit of Australia and Australians, including yourself.
To be specific, if they were made in Australia by Bond’s, the money you paid over the counter is
assisting to make up the sum of £4,000 which every Week is helping to bring happiness into the
homes of the 1200 Australian Men and Women, Youths and Girls, engaged in the manufacture
of BOND’S Hosiery. It is subsidising Australian Cotton Growing, which bids fair to rival wool-growing
in importance, by creating a yearly demand for £250,000 worth of Australian-grown Colton ( required
for the Cotton, Lisle, and Mercerised Lisle Tops and Feet of Bond’s Hosiery). It is decreasing our
load of Foreign debt, of which, normally, over-importation is a prime cause. It is helping Australia
to become really the Land of Opportunity. It is assisting to banish the spectres of unemployment
and want from Australia, and to make it a Brighter, Safer, Happier land to live in for you and yours.
And all these big results are being achieved, not only without sacrifice on your part, but with actual,
practical, and immediate benefit to yourself, since it is nothing short of the bare truth that you pay

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
URE CATCH TACKLE
Since Tutankhamen is in the boom it was
only fitting that Papyrus (7’s) should win the Eng-
lish Der y, and that Pharos (fi’s) should be second.
Parth (33’s) completed the triumph of alliteration
over the hopes of punters who had backed the
favorite, Town Guard (s\s), which uncertain steed
finished 13th in a field of 19. Papyrus was piloted
to victory by the 39-year-old Steve Donoghue, who
rode the winners in 1922 and 1921, and also in
1917 and 1915. But Parth, who is owned by the
Indian sportsman Goculdos and was ridden by the
Melbourne jockey A. Walker, would probably have
spoilt the unique achievement had he got well away.
Left 20 lengths at the barrier he finished a length
behind Pharos and 21 lengths behind Donoghue’s
mount.

Convinced at last that Seremite, winner of
the Queensland St. Leger and the Brisbane Cup, is a
good horse —probably as good as Kingslot—Banana-
land punters made him favorite for the 10-furlong
Moreton Handicap, run on the last day of the
Q.T.C. meeting. Seremite gave them a capital run
for their money, but failed by a length to beat
another Seremond youngster in Warwick Gun (12’s),
to whom he was conceding 151 b. However, those
who backed the Cup horse on the machine showed
a profit of 6s. 6d. on every 10s. staked. Syce Knight
(6 to 4 on) added the 9-furlong Royal Stakes to his
score of w.f.a wins, Laneffe and Sarrail being nearest
to him in an uninteresting finish. In spite of his
execrable showing a week before there were simple-
tons who backed Tangalooma at the dynamite odds
of 4to 1. They were sadder as well as poorer when
he lumbered in last.
* * * #
“The Deacon”: Talking of jumpers, I
wonder if Randwick or Flemington will ever see a
horse of the quality of the Maorilander El Gallo?
Bought off the flat at Ellerslie for 300 guineas, El
Gallo returned W. J. Ralph the purchase money
at the first time of asking. Ralph, who is the John
Brown of Maoriland—he owns the Taupiri coalmines
in the Waikato dis-
trict-handed the nag
over to be trained for
“lepping” to Paddy
Jones, Auckland’s lead-
ing horse-handler, and
under Jones’s care he
pulled off the big
winter double, hurdles
and steeple, for the
first time in 20
years. He repeated
the amazing perform-
ance next year. And
then one day El
Gallo drifted out of
life. For no appa-
rent reason—except,
perhaps, that he feared
they might want him
to go for the treble
—he dropned dead in
his loose-box.

totalisator at Kensington (N.S.W.) pony races on
Saturday. King Oweda’s success in the first division
of the Novice was worth £lO3 11s. 6d. to each of the
two grandstand punters who took tickets on him;
and Royal Guard, second in the second division, made
Barry, the one-legged swimmer (the other limb
is in France), richer by £BB 14s. 6d. Substantial
dividends are rare in N. S. Wales on the 60-20-20
(or 50-30-20) plan of distribution, which tends to
make the tote merely a concession-betting implement.
They are much more frequent in Westraiia, which
State goes in for straight-out as well as p ace totes.
One great advantage of the W.A. system is that the
to.e-punter who backs a third horse each way gener-
ally shows a profit. A man who tried to cover s.o.
bets by staking equal amounts on, say, the absurd
contrivance at Randwick would soon grow tired of
it.

Adelaide Racing Club, having the third
day of its Birthday Cup meeting on a holiday
(though in bad weather), made a new record tor
the State with £121,000 through the tote for the
meeting. George Milne, an owner usually unlucky,
won the Alderman Cup with Armada, a three-year-
old Pistol colt; and Charles Irwin, a member of the
committee, was another successful owner —not before
his time. The Chaffeys’ Waranton won the last race
of a month, which —S.A.J.C. and A.R.C. alike—-has
been remarkable for the non-success, on the whole,
of the visiting contingent. Attendances were very
large, but not countable, as the A.R.C., racing on
a strip of park lands leased from the Adelaide Cor-
poration, has to admit the public free to the flat.
* * * *
“Adelaide” : A great tip was thrown at
backers in a minor event at the Adelaide R.C.
meeting. It was the second race of the second
day. the date was June 2. The horse was seepnd
on the programme (and therefore Np. 2 on the
tote tickets) ; and his name is Deuce (by Two).
Naturally the public took the tip, and when the
tote closed he was found to be second favorite.
Some argued that in the circumstances he couldn’t
lose, others that logically he ought to give the
Long Arm a help by running second. He won by
half a head, and paid a dividend a shade over 2
to 1.

Ireland, making its debut as a nation in
Davis Cup contests, has beaten India by three
matches to two. Switzerland, also entering for
the first time, has knocked out Czeeho-Slovakia by
the same margin, whilst a similarly close battle
between Holland and Italy ended in a victory for
the Dutchmen on points. Spain, which got a
walkover last year from England that enabled it
to face Australia in the final, has slipped into Hie
second round through the default of Roumania.
The Spaniards have now an engagement with
Britain on grass at Manchester, and if Manoel
Alonzo is in the hidalgos’ team, the Englishmen,
headed by Lycett, will have a struggle to hold
their own. Alonzo, who beat; Pat O’Hara Wood
in exciting circumstances in America, is quite
capable of whipping Lycett in singles, but it is
doubtful if he can find a partner strong enough to
fac e Lycett and Godfree in the doubles. The luck
of the draw will give France an easy run; in fact,
the Gauls will only encounter serious opposition
from the winner of the England v. Spain engage-
ment.

“15-30”: Following on the unmerciful lick-
ing she got from Suzanne Lenglen in the Riviera,
Mrs. Mallory, the U.S. champion, has been twice-
defeated in England—by Kitty McKane and Mrs.
Clayton. Miss McKane scored 6-3, 6-2. She is con-
tinually improving in her game, and English tennis-
writers look upon her as a performer who may yet
lower the colors of the Frenchwoman. The latter
announces that she fears the English girl most in
the approaching battles at Wimbledon; so, if they
meet in the final, the gallery will be tremendous.
* * * *
John J. McGraw, the great little man of
U.S. baseball, talks of sending his N.Y. Giants and
another crack American team on a second world’s
tour, which will include Australia. The, Giants and
the Chicago White Sox blew into Sydney in 1914,
and their weird barracking amused the crowd. But
Australian baseball has got into bigger clothes
since then, and local followers of the game will
rival the Yanks in making noises, if not in playing
ball.

“Machete”: The recent agitation in Mel-
bourne and Sydney against the overdoing of public-
schools sport recalls a queer happening in England.
J. E. King, head of Clifton, wrote to the Times pro-
testing against a combined .athletic meeting of public
schools at Stamford Bridge, which had taken place
the day before. For the meeting and its title of
“Public School Sports,’’ said the reverend reformer,
“the London Athletic Club and the press were re-
sponsible, and not the school authorities.” After a
stunned calm, about 5000 correspondents fell
over themselves to tell the Clifton head that his own
school had won the Grand Challenge Cup at the
sports. “I was not aware beforehand that any Clif-
ton boy was competing,” was the bewildered old
gentleman’s reply.

At. Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
George White, a Melbourne lightweight, outpointed
Jack Finney in a 10-round go, and Ben Martin,
White’s stable-companion, secured the decision oyer
another Sydneyite in Jimmy Ryan. The White-
Finney scrap was willing all the time, but the other
was an infliction; in fact, the bill wasn’t worth
the high prices exacted. The Stadium people have
an annoying habit of raising their tariff when the
Godfreys and Bradleys are engaged, but never lower
it when second-raters are on the menu. It is a
rotten way of doing business, but no doubt the
management has reason for the belief that Sydney
crowds will stand anything.
Saturday was a bad night for Sydney pugs. In
Melbourne the admirable Spargo, who is boxing all
the better for his holiday in the Speck and other
parts, took on Jerry Suliivan, showed a huge mob
how a scientist can handle a slugger, and stopped
Jeremiah in the 19th round. Spargo is to meet
Grime again for the featherweight title. But it is
a sore trouble to the veteran nowadays to make 9st.
at the ringside.

“Pongo”: The cableman informed us the
other day that Duke Kahannmoku, now a professional,
had established a world’s record by splashing
over 50 yards in 22 3-ssec. Kahanamoku equalled
this time on March 13, 1915, at Auckland (M.L.).
Anyhow, 50 yards is not recognised as a world’s
record distance. Another cabled misstatement is
that Lily Bowmer, of Honolulu, had made a new
world’s record by swimming 50 yards in 28see.
Paula Hoeft (M.L.) has done it in _27 4-ssec.
“Azac”: Kahanamoku’s figures are only 1 l-ssec.
better than Alick Wickham’s Australian record,
which dates bark to 1910. A week before Alick
accomplished it he was given a try-out over the 50yds.
in Farmer’s baths. Bill Farmer held the watch,
and on completing the course Alick gasped, “That
should be somewhere near her.” “The watch makes
it 21 seconds,” replied Bill. Naturally he thought
the timepiece was playing a trick on him, and Alick
took it as a huge joke. But when the ticker regis-
tered 23 2-ssec. for the subsequent swim, in which
Wickham met with interference, having to ease up
and go round Tas. Jones, Alick’s face was a study.
“That 21 seconds,” he said, “mightn’t have been a
joke after all.” Though as fat as a porpoise Wick-
ham can still do the hundred in a minute or there-
abouts. He plays Rugby League football with the
Clovelly Juniors.
* ♦ * *
“Centurion”: We hear a lot about the
Australian’s diverse and manifold interests in the
world of sport, but I doubt if he can beat the
Lancashire lad, for variety at least. From a Man-
chester paper 1 have taken a list of sporting events
for one day only, in and around Manchester. It
consists of racing, trotting, boxing, jumping, quoit-
ing, trail-hunting, dog-racing, claybird-shooting,
bowling, brasses, Peggy, knurr and spell, footracing,
rabbit-coursing and wrestling. I thought I knew a
bit about Lancashire sport, 1 but “brasses” and
“Peggy” have me beaten. Anyone explain ?
THE JUSTIFICATION.
MASHIE : “ You’re always playing golf these
days — what?”
SLIOER : “Aw, well, it keeps a fellah fit.”
MASHIE : “Fit for what?”
ALIOER : “More golf.”
F. G. Murdoch and H. R. Sinclair were
the finalists in the N.S.W. amateur golf championship
at Bose Bay. In the semi-finals, both had had easy
victories—Murdoch over Eric Apperley, the title-
holder,'and Sinclair at G. Thompson’s expense—and
in the deciding tussle both played excellent golf.
Sinplair, who is quite a youngster, was one up after
the morning round, which he completed in 76; but
in the afternoon the long veteran drew level at the
33rd hole, where the youth made a bad shot, and took
the lead at the 35th. Murdoch won by two up, re-
turning a card of 72, and in the enthusiasm of the
moment there was talk of chairing him to the club-
house. But, looking twice at his 6ft. 4in. of muscu-
lar manhood, his friends decided they had better not.

Although defeated by N. S. Wales in two
matches at Sydney, the Maoriland bowlers were far
from disgraced. In the first, they were only three
points to the bad (91-88), and in the second they
were a point closer (91-89). W. Staley (N.S.W.)
was the only skipper to gain both his games. His
four’s 34-17 against Hutchinson’s quartette (M.L.)
was a noteworthy achievement.

Eastern Suburbs, conquered earlier in the
season by South Sydney and Western Suburbs, put
North Sydney through on Saturday by 16 points
(4 tries 2 goals) to 8 points (2 tries 1 goal).
It was the premiers’ first defeat this season. They
were without Blinkhorn, their flying winger, and
had rather the worse of the luck, but East were the
better team on the day. The winners’ pack was
strengthened by Watkins, who played a great game.
North’s star was Herman Peters, than whom there
was no finer ’bailer on the grass. In a hard contest
on the Sports Ground, South Sydney defeated Bal-
main by 7 points to 3, and they now head the list.

rowing has never been declared professional, but
League football, in the mass and in detail, has, and
that bv one of the oldest of the Amateur Sporting
Federation members, the Rugby Union. That blacks
out League football clubs for all other members
of the Federation. I don’t know whether any of
the Brisbane eight are Rugby League players, but
even so, the rules of amateur rowing in Australia
would not bar them. Even the R.U. will admit
any pro. to its ranks save a professional League
footballer. There is little doubt, however, that the
Brisbane ’Varsity Union has erred against the laws
of amateurism by permitting the League footballers
to affiliate.
* * * *
“Leagueite”: “Centurion” (B. 7/6/’23) is
talking through his hat when he says that League
Rugbv is a professional game. No game is profes-
sional, although those who play it may be. The
N S W.A.A.A. certainly warned amateurs against
competing at the Rugby-League sports because the
prizes were cash. But the A.A.A. decrees,- as also
does the N.S.W. Amateur Swimming, Association,
that its members do not infringe their amateur
status by playing League Rugby as amateurs along-
side professional players. I maintain that Sydney
’Varsity League ciub is an amateur body. It is
enough for. me that the Australian ’Varsity Sports
Union awarded “blues” to Sydney and Bananaland
Uni. players who opposed the M.L. Uni. League team.
» • * *
“Serummager”: Bob Craig, the recently-
appointed N.S.W, Rugby League selector, has repped
for N.S.W. in four branches of athletics. He be-
gan as a Soccer crack; then took on Union Rugby
and toured England with the Wallabies. In 1909
he was converted to the League game, and eventu-
ally went abroad with the Kangaroos. As a
swimmer he won six State championships and one
Australian, and in 1900 he earned the Royal
Humane Society’s silver medal and certificate for
recovering the body of Diver John Rodricks from
under a vessel in Mort’s Dock. Craig brought the
dead man up in his diving-dress, a wonderful feai
of strength and endurance.
* » » *
“Leagueite”: The late Dick Arnold (B.
31/5/23) was not only famous among a past genera-
tion of footballers for having captained the Wal-
laroos. With his brother Monty and a few cronies he
formed that, the first Rugby club in Australia. Dash-
ing forwards both, Dick and Monty were great sup-
porters of the code, as Joseph Carruthers, sometime
hon. sec. of the Sydney Uni. club, discovered when
he tried, in the late ’seventies, to introduce new
rules with the idea of eliminating scrums. Though
Australian-born, Dick Arnold went to Rugby School,
immortalised by a namesake. Monty, a magnificent
specimen of manhood, died at 68, four years before
the elder brother.
» * * *
“Wilfrido” : The visit of a Maoriland team
to England next year should bring about a cessation
of the strained relations at present existing between
the English and M.L. Rugby Unions. Hitherto the
E.R.U7 has refused to allow low persons from the
Dominions to have a voice in the formulation of
rules for the betterment of the game. The rules of
Rugby, like those of golf, can do with a thorough
overhauling annually; and the proposed round-table
discussion by representatives of all Rugby-playing
countries should end the eternal wrangles that mark
the meetings of local unions. It is suggested that
representatives of N.S.W. should be included in the
team, but Maoriland enthusiasts are not exactly
warming to that idea.
* * * *
Australia beat Maoriland in the Soccer
match at Brisbane, but there wasn’t much in it.
Each side had a goal till a few minutes from
Dme; then W. Maunder, the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
forward, got a pass from Thompson and did the
trick. Maunder played a rattling game through-
out and made critics who had howled against his
inclusion look foolish.
* * * *
South Atis. has had its first visit from a
Tasmanian football team, and that was to play
Soccer. The home side was soundly beaten, 3 goals
to 0.
* * * *
“Tren”: “0.R.” (B. 31/5/’23) suggests
that if T. W. Wills really was responsible for the birth
of Australian football the hardness of Melbourne’s
early playing areas, and not the rigor of the Rugby
game, was the reason. As to that, an old Melbourne
periodical, the Footballer, of 1875, states: “Mr.
Wills considered that the game [Rugby], although
very suitable for schools, was too rough for grown
men who had to earn their living.” Certainly the
grounds were cruel ’ard in those days. My dad,
who kicked every goal a Richmond team scored in
a pre-competitive season, often told me they were
worn bare of grass, and a fall on the loose-graveily
surface always made a wide and deep wound.
* # * #
The bad luck that has pursued Carlton
this season refuses to quit them. No sooner had
their star forward, Clover, recovered from the
knock-out he got in the Richmond match than the
’flu laid him out; and though they had the better
of the pbiy against South Melbourne their shame-
ful score of 5 goals 19 beh'nds was 2 points less
than South’s 7 goals 9 behinds. A sensational finish
between Essendon and Richmond sent the Tigers’
barrackers home dour and disgusted. Fourteen minutes
before the end Richmond led by 20 points. Then
’Don woke up, piled on 8 consecutive goals, and
won by 87 points to 65. Their redoubtable forward,
Stockdale, now boasts 28 goals for the 6 games
played. Fitzroy beat Melbourne by 77 points to
70, and Geelong turned the tables on St. Kilda in
the last quartet, adding 26 points to nil and get-
ting the verdict by 58 points to 46.
“Wink”: Stockdale, who has kicked 13 more goals
than his closest rival, Jimmy Freake, of Fitzroy,
was a lucky find. After playing him as a back man in
all the previous matches, the ’Dons, working on the
theory that no one could be worse than the goajers
they had, tried him forward in last year’s final. He
sprang at onee into the champion class, and his five
goals (out of six kicked by Essendon) nearly won
the game. Stockdale is not, however, as brainy as
Dick Lee, of Collingwood, or such a character as
Bob Merrick, of Fitzroy, both of-whom retired last
year. Bob was a particular annoyance to opposing
backs who met him for the first time. When fight-
ing desperately for the ball he would exhaust all the
graces of an extensive Fitzroy vocabulary, and then
start again. The opponent, careful of his' good name
and touchy regarding his family history, would
demand an explanation. Bob’s fashion then was to
wave the interrupter aside and remark: “You cranky
brute, I was only talking to the ball.”
“Trekle”: The most picturesque punch
ever administered' on a Melbourne football ground
was delivered years agone by George Topping, of Carl-
ton, and received by Streckfus, of South Melb. Andy
McDonald, a small but resolute Carlton back, started
it by aggravating the big South follower into swing-
ing him a beauty. Everyone,' except the officials,
saw the blow. Topping, tiniest of goal sneaks,
charged from 70yds. to avenge his cobber. Cheered
on by the crowd, and gathering speed as he came,
he put every ounce of strength and velocity into
one mighty swipe, which sent the six-foot Southerner
(who had been the only person unaware of the
impending tragedy) to the ground like a pithed
bullock. Streckfus went out for three minutes;
Topping for three years;-

Vic Richardson, captain of the S.A.
football XVIII against Westralia, has the unusual
distinction of having captained its cricket XI too.
He has also represented the State at baseball, and
played for his district (Sturt) in first-grade lacrosse.
THE HEROES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The King had an awful gruelling. Most of them
finished with empty bags on Saturday, yet with stiff
upper lips, grimly determined, they were at their
posts again on Monday.’’ —Sydney Sun.
Tell not of soldiers who on shell-torn field
’Gainst hopeless odds in grim defiance bleed,
Or gallant bluejackets who scorn to yield
E’en when beneath their feet the decks recede.
Valor as dogged here you see revealed,
Types as intrepid of the bulldog breed.
Never before did such a gruelling
For pencillers a Randwick meeting bring.
But —did they quail—the Ring ?
Not much! Upon that dismal Saturday
Each at his possie stood serene and bold.
And smiled insouciant, though in long <irray
Favorite after favorite homeward rolled.
Never a chiv exhibited dismay,
Never a quiver from those hearts of gold.
Never a whine. Few even swore aloud,
Impassively they paid the surging crowd
Tails up—and heads unbowed.
A facer! Aye, but did they dip their flags,
Dazed with such buffets, smitten with such rods?
Or toss away their sadly lightened bags
Cursing blind Chance and her erratic gods?
Or doff their rings and pins and gladsome rags
And take a vow to lay no more the odds?
Not they! When Monday opened bright and fair
And “Lay the Field” broke on the upland air,
Why—every Ike was there,!

The first sale of town allotments in Mel-
bourne was held on June 1, 1837, and con-
ducted by Robert Hoddle, surveyor-in-charge,
who took as his commission the frontage in
Elizabeth-street, between Bourke-street and
Little Collins-street, on the west side, the
nominal price of the two half-acres being 154.
“Riverina” : The Maori, as a rule, is not
exercised by the statistics that have recently
been troubling an Australian bishop. Hori
called on a local pastrycook with an order
for a large cake—-“t’e two-tecker —kettin’
marrit soon,” he explained. Knowing Hori’s
casual financial ways the confectioner de-
murred. “A two-decker is expensive, you
know,” he said cautiously; “surely a single
one would do.” “Oh, fat’s all right,” said
the customer importantly, producing a roll
of notes. “Prenty proomin’ hoot ’ere! You
see, poss,” he confided, “I want t’e two-
tecker —one for t’e wettin’ an’ one for t’e
chris’enin’.”
“Warrawong”: Mullineux, captain of the
English Rugby team which toured Austra-
lia about ’99, is my entry for the Fighting
Parson. With most of his team he joined
up and went through the Boer War before
returning to England. In 1914, as chaplain
to the Seamen’s Mission at San Francisco,
he found it so difficult to enlist that he jour-
neyed to Wellington (M.L.) on a Union
liner as chief spud-peeler. Taken out of
the ranks and made chaplain, he was
promptly clinked by a zealous sarn-major
for impersonating an officer. He finished
with two wound-stripes and an M.C. ribbon,
and is now controlling in France an asso-
ciation for enabling relatives to visit the
military cemeteries.
Bishop Cleary, of Auckland (M.L.), is
back from his regulation call upon the Pope
—the rule says that these visits mustn’t be
more than 10 years apart. The Bish., who
is now assisted in his job by Maoi'ilander
Ur. Liston (who stood his trial for treason
about a year ago), is one of the oldest of
clerical pressmen, and was for many years
a very militant editor of the Tablet, the
R.C. official organ of the Rickety Isles, In
his lighter moments he runs to mechanical
inventions, and this with his motoring in-
clinations has led him to place an improved
pump on the market. He was. the first
bishop to employ the seaplane to reach the
outlying portions of his diocese; but nowa-
days he is well on towards 70 and in poor
health, so he lets the coadjutor do most of
the bullocking.
“T. 0.1.”: Frank Burgen Standish (B.
81/5/’23) was not the only one of his family
to make a name in Australasia. Cap. Fred-
erick Charles Standish, one-time Chief Com-
missioner of Police in Vic., was 'son of
Charles Standish, of Standish Hall, Wigan,
Lancashire. He came to Vic. in 1852, and
got a Government job as Assistant Commis-
sioner of Goldfields at Bendigo, combining
with it the duties of. Protector of Chows.
On the resignation of Captain McMahon
Standish became Chief Commissioner of
Police (1858-1880). He made the Melbourne
Club his home ; owned some good horses, which
were raced in his trainer’s name; and was
a welcome guest at Sydney Government
House in Hercules Robinson’s time. It was
even thought that one of th'e daughters of
the house might become Mrs. Stand sh, but
the clubman was a confirmed bachelor. He
died on St. Pat.’s Day, 1.883, and, tnougu
he was District Grand Master of Free-
masons under the English constitution, is
said to have joined the R.C. Church just
prior to passing out.
“Machete”: “10-2-4’s” story of the late
John Norton and the frog at Mediow Hydro
(B. 10/5 ’23) appeals to me as thoroughly
characteristic of its subject. But, as an ex-
sub-editor of one of John’s papers, I find it
less stimulating than some of the literary
efforts of the self-appointed Tribune of the
People. Once in Brisbane he attacked the
Temperance Alliance, and the leader of the
water-waggoners replied from the platform
in highly , superior tones. “Who is John
Norton?” he said in conclusion. “I laugh
him to scorn —ha, ha, ha!” Next day John
came into my office and borrowed the Web-
ster’s Dictionary, his usual practice when
he meant business. In a trifle of three and
a half columns he tore his assailant to
shreds. After setting out his opponent’s
conclusion quoted above, John began : “This
Temerarious Tugmutton has the damned
audacity to say that he is ignorant of the
name John Norton. Who am I, forsooth!
Rather, who is he, the crepuscular, cachin-
natory, cacophonous, coprolitic cow!” I
still preserve that gem in my scrap-book,
and leave it at that, with the addendum that
the word “cow” was an alteration of my own.
“Schnorrer”: According to a statement
issued by the British Colonial Office in Janu-
ary, 7844 Jewish immigrants entered Pales-
tine during 1922, making a total, since the
ordinance regulating immigration was pro-
mulgated in September, 1920, of 20,058. And
the influx continues: 887 arrived in January
last, and that is now about the average. As
for funds, they grow stead.ly. Three-quarters
of a million pounds has been subscribed to
the Keren Ilayesod, the fund which finances
the activities of the Zionist organisation ; and
there is a campaign to raise a special two
million dollars in New York, and various
large amounts in other American cities —
some have over-subscribed their objectives.
There are other funds, each having its own
work; and then there are numerous semi-
business undertakings for which money has
been subscribed liberally. There are banks,
land-settlement and building cos., and such
concerns as the Palestine Engineering Cor-
poration and the Rutenburg Water and
Power scheme. Australasian Jewry, for its
part, undertook to raise £78,000 for the
Palestine Restoration Fund, and there have
been individual subscriptions to particular
undertakings. To the funds of one kind and
another practically all the Jews of the world
are subscribing. The Marranos of Spain—
descendants of the Spanish Jews who, to
escape the terrors of the Inquisition or de-
portation, abandoned their religion—have
revived their Judaism and swung behind the
movement, and even in the interior of Brazil
a settlement of 800 Marranos has come to
light with a contribution.

Though heavy pruning will be necessary
to reduce “Tangerine,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, to reasonable length—it didn’t finish
until midnight on Saturday—it is doubtful
if the most judicious editing will remove the
story’s dulness or give distinction in per-
sonnel and music. None of the tunes are
inveigling, and with the exception of May
Beatty, Mark Daly and Ireland Cutter, the
cast is nothing to write poems about. For
a start, a keg of ginger might be distributed
among three of the four young men (the
other is Cutter aforesaid) wift> monopolise
the talk in the first scene as indigent
divorces impounded in a comic American
gaol for failure to pay their alimony. There
is some humor here when the lads chatter
over the ’phone to their former belongings,
who are shown in illuminated nooks —May
Beatty, for one, goggled and grinning in a
bath —but the joke is all on the side of the
ladies. In this scene Leyland Hodgson is
more engaging than Robert Jackson and
Alex. McPherson, who are crudely inadequate
all through.
* * * *
When the practically unnoticeable plot
moves to Mark Daly’s island kingdom
in the Pacific, where all the girls’
hair' seems to have been caught in the
explosion of a tomato-sauce factory, the
aforesaid quartette are again strongly in evi-
dence, and, again excluding Cutter from the
criticism, one would welcome any diversion
that would palliate the effect of their
übiquity. Mark Daly shines at this stage of
the proceedings as a derelict potentate with
a retinue of wives, supported by a dime-
show conception of an American secretary
impersonated by Wesley Pierce, though
Mark’s success is more due to his grotesque
make-up and devastating lines than to any
personal jocosity. To be sure, he has some
cheerful moments with May Beatty in an
attempt to restore the rearmost portion of
the anatomy to its old place in the national
humor; but May is the more forceful of the
two, and in old Egyptian dress, or as a
buxom symbolical figure endeavoring to com-
bine the dignity of Britannia with the
armorial embellishments of a Roman cen-
turion, she is happy in every particular.
“THE FAITHFUL HEART,” AT MEL-
BOURNE NEW PALACE.
G. H. Mulcaster, leading man, as Waverley
Ango, 1899, and Lieut.-Col Waverley
Ango 20 years later.
She sings with all her old pungency and pro-
duces a funny burlesque tone that is as du’cet
as a can on a flying dog’s tail. Mamie Wat-
son’s voice has a thin ukulele timbre here
and there, and her vaunted allurement is
limited to graceful physical factors assisted
by the sorcery of a well-choSen dressmaker.
No doubt the actress is a dream of pretti-
ness, but, in the absence of personality, too
like an endless queue of meringues. .Tune
Roberts is a sprightly little fay as before ;
Hazel Harris is charming in all her toe-
exhibitions; and Maudie Vera and Ena Dale
are "demonstrations of mostly dumb protest
at their unimportance in the procession.
The choicest compliments must go to the
scenery and to Minnie Hooper’s long, gleam-
ing line of piquant show-girls. Again and
again the latter nip a yawn in the bud with
some decorative climax or some unexpected
gesture in the mazes of the dance.
* * * *
“Enter Madame” is the vehicle at Mel-
bourne Royal wherein Gertrude Elliott is
now showing her qualifications for tempera-
mental outbursts in the upper register. The
piece is no more than a divertissement, owing
much of its humor to its profusion of Dago
personalities, while the plot, portraying
Madame’s gentle husband reduced to nincom-
poopery by studied obeisance to her whims
and tantrums, is as artificially light in tex-
ture as Cosmo Hamilton’s “Silver Fox.” A
sense of the judicious in voice and bearing
—even a suspicion of English ladylikeness
beneath the Italianated warmth of the im-
personation—keeps Gertrude Elliott to the
path of pure comedy, whereas a stronger
concentration on the physical exercises of a
diva in a rage would plunge the actress into
screaming farce. As it is, farce is never
far away. The supper-party, in which the
temporarily divorced husband introduces his
new flame to the prima donna’s family, is
made boisterously diverting by the antics of
the cook, who performs on some wooden in-
strument of the clarionet family after serv-
ing truffles and drinks all round. Despite
its apparent triviality, this character, Archi-
mede, gets a donation from William Molli-
son’s store of personality, and develops from
a caricature into a recognisable human being.
Cronin Wilson, as the poor husband, stows
away some of the ponderous aloofness visible
in the entanglements of “Woman to Woman,”
and, regardless of the drawback of his chroni-
cally husky voice, manages to create a
quietly ludicrous figure. Eilias Waldqgrave,
the other woman of the story, has a tinkly,
superficial tone expressing tne deepest sym-
pathy for her comparative extinction. J. B.
Rowe speaks manfully as the prima donna’s
son, and Anne McEwen’s sweetness, as his
fiancee, Aline, adds a spoonful of molasses.
Gertrude Boswell, in the part of the secre-
tary, Miss Smith, suffers from acrid spin-
steria, and publishes a withered sniff at in-
tervals. Athol Forde is an opera-sodden
doctor who tries for the high C in his bursts
of enthusiasm, and Maggie Moore is a fount
of small talk who always hits the audience
in a tender place. The staging is tasteful,
and Madame’s gowns are gorgeous.
# * *
Louis Esson’s “Mother and Son,” pro-
duced at St. Peter’s Hall, Melbourne, last
week, is stronger in feeling than his
“Battler,” which was staged at the Play-
house some months back. This time a bush
drama of disappointment and suffering is
given a flavor of sex-interest by the intru-
sion of a light o’ love called Emma, whose
capacity for gloomy dalliance with anything
available wrecks the life and happiness of
a shiftless young yokel, Harry Lind, and
promises to bring a squatter’s son to grief.
The giddy lady, accompanied by Harry,
blows into the Lind residence when the old
man is dying placidly in the corner; and
hereabouts there is a suggestion of the Irish
literary drama in the comparative neglect of
the approaching corpse for the unexpected
scandal of a wayside amour that loiters under
the family root. The scene is fa rly well
handled, though a swaggie, who has developed
a passion for the Ivoran after whittling
away his patience on Gibbon’s “Decline and
Fall,” is a rather incongruous factor in him-
self, regardless of his aloofness from the tra-
gedy that is groping its way to a sombre
conclushn. George Dawe played this char-
acter in a breezy professional manner, and
Leo Burke was satisfactory in the part of
Harry. Emma’s disposition towards unfet-
tered gaiety was presented with a suspicion
of a flounce by Hilda Bull, though her hard
tone was wanting in faith, hope and charity.
No exception can be taken to the picture
of Mrs. Lind by Alice Crowther, nor to the
chortling Ted of Reg Moyle and the homely
Peggy of Irene Appleton. But Charles
Doherty was a bit underdone for Jim Blake,
and Stewart Macky’s youthful baritone shat-
tered his imposture in the tangled locks and
whiskers of Peter Lind. The curtain-raiser,
“The Voice of the People,” by Allan Mulgan,
was an attempt to show a political soul
naked and unashamed. Its lack of dramatic
substance was rather cruelly exposed by
Hettie Feuerman, Mabel Appleton, J. O’Con-
nell and Frank Crossley. ■■■■■■■«.
Thei’e is nothing tonic or exciting about
the programmes of the Westminster Glee
Singers at Melbourne Town Hall, nor
are their artless flights of humor calculated
to buckle up a bagman in riotous mirth;
but they all have pleasant, well-trained
voices, and their ensemble warbling is effec-
tive, as a rule. The squad comprises five
boy sopranos and five grown-ups, including
the manager, Edward Branscombe, and the
most gifted is the bass. John Andrews, who
is refreshingly masculine in tone ard diction
—especially after the tootling of the tenor,
Ellis Vizard, and the lamblike gambols of
Donald Reid’s alto among the vernal slades
of song. The upper reaches of Alfred Cun-
ningham’s baritone are well tested in the
•‘Yeoman’s Wedding” kind of melody, and
he is generally well qualified to set meek
maidens simpering. Of the infant songsters.

The orchestra at Melbourne Palace is
urged to drop its excursions into grand
opera and try some melodies more appropri-
ate to the story of “The Faithful Heart.”
For instance, if it played “Oh, He Had Such
Beautiful Eyes” at the end of the Prologue,
following with “Daddy” and “The Girl I
Left Behind Me” for the first act, with “It
Breaks My Heart to Leave You” and “We
Parted on the Shore” for the second spasm,
it would give a popular musical outline of
the tale.
“Mary” again came to light at Melbourne
Majesty’s on Saturday, with Kathlyn Hil-
liard and Eric Masters in the love-nest epi-
sodes in which Maud Fane previously part-
nered Roland Hogue. Miss Hilliard is pass-
able, but lacks the feminine niftiness of her
predecessor ; Eric Masters is no improve-
ment on Hogue, who never caused a rush
of superlatives to the pen. The others are
the same as before, Ethel Morrison playing
the heavyweight widow to the immaterial
Percy. The main feature of the show con-
tinues to be the dancing by the old Ex-
quisite Eight.

Melbourne Majestic has found room r for
“The Hottentot,” an adaptation of a Willie
Collier play that Nat Gould in a bright
moment might have written. A reel of serio-
comic uplift slides by under the title of “The
Foolish Age” at the same house. Something
resembling a Rugby scrum is visible in the
battle for “Nobody’s Money at Hoyt’s,” while
“Morals,” conspicuous in the follow-ons, re-
vives long-dead memories of W. J. Locke’s
“Morals of Marcus Ordeyne.” The reappear-
ance, of, “Over the Hill” has broken the
drought at the Melba. In fact, the tear-
ducts are running a banker. “Beyond the
Rainbow” continues the dry spell at the Bri-
tannia, but a change to wet weather is ex-
pected next week.

At Her Majesty’s, Sydney: For weeks
galore, nigh twenty-four, there’s tripped
along to glad encore Miss Josie Melville’s
“Sally,” and some few more are still in
store, the indications are, before the time
will come for “Vale!”
“The Cat and the Canary” is still making
spines quiver when it isn’t tickling dia-
phragms at Sydney Cri. Its mission will
be concluded on Saturday week, when Gertrude
Elliott (Lady Forbes Robertson) and her
English dramatic company will present
“Woman to Woman.”

The only fault Sydney seems like to find
with “Chu Chin Chow,” at the Royal, is that
the time for seeing the gorgeously spectacular
production is all too brief. Packed houses
and other indications of critical approval
have resulted in the season being extended
to Wednesday week; till then Abu Hasan,
the robber sheik, will continue to take his
toll of tumultuous acclaim and Oscar Asche
his harvest of the box-office.

An open season for Dickens impersonators
has been proclaimed at Sydney Tivoli. Last
week it was Herbert Barton; now Clement
May produces, first, a character sketch of
Charles himself, and then impersonations of
Uriah Heep, Fagin and Scrooge—all good.
Piano-wizard Herschel Henlere continues t<>
give joy to highbrows and lowbrows alike ;
and Audrey Knight is still a tolerable little
comedienne whose songs seem, however, over-
loaded with eulogies of parricide.
Carried on the wave of Primitivism that
is sweeping over Moviedom, Sydney Globe
is back to the reign of Henry of the six
wives. “When Knighthood was in Flower”
is the new attraction, and the fight for the
fair heroine is as crooked as a Labor pre-
selection ballot. The Lyceum offers a cret?py
thing called “The Light in the Dark” ; and
“The Foolish Age” contains some arguments
against giving votes to flappers. The Strand
has Jack Holt and May McAvoy; and the
Crystal Palace, in addition to Chaplin, has
“Lorna Doone” and “The Darling of the
Rich” —the heroine of the latter wearing a
string of multi-millionaires. “Smilin'
Through” has gone to the Empress; and
“The Queen of Sheba” is still leaving her
visiting-card with Solomon at the Town Hall.

The strong Williamson co. playing “The
Southern Maid” at Adelaide Royal was rein-
forced for an “Arcadians” revival, Leslie Hol-
land and Dan Agar coming in to do the
humorous parts, and Gladys Moncrieff taking
a rest while an Adelaide girl, May Foulds,
showed a sweet soprano in the part of
Sombra. The Prince of Wales’s, since it
cannot get Ada Reeve in “Spangles,” has
done the next best thing and got in Gus
McNaughton. Gerardy, at the Town Hall,
was so successful that he promises a short
return season on coming back from Perth.

At Wondergraph, Valentino is giving one
more sermon on the popular text of the

any kind of skin except white; and at the
Grand Monte Blue is still another kind of

sponsibilities of motherhood.

THE FACE POWODER
“Plasmon”: Mrs. Hilton Phillipson, the
third woman to find a seat in the House of
Commons, made her first appearance on the
stage, as Mabel Russell, with one of George
Edwardes’s companies at Daly’s, London.
She was only about 17 at the time, and be-
ing attractive and vigorous she saw a lot
of bright life in “A Country Girl,” “The
Cingalee,” “The Little Michus,” “The
Spring Chicken” and other trifles of the
type. She was also heard in “The Merry
Widow,” “Gipsy Love” and “The Girls of
Gottenberg,” but in more recent years
she has varied comedy with occasional
outbreaks in the legitimate. The Fog re-
members her Aggie Lynch in “Within the
Law” as a young person of crafty address, and
she also tickled the Cockney tancy as Uae-rfy
Waters in “London Pride.” Her first hus-
band, Stanley Rhodes, was a cousin of Cecil
Rhodes; her second is a captain in the Scots
Guards.
“Santander”: Having made the most of
“the little farm in Surrey” for publicity pur-
poses, Maud Fane declared in Melbourne the
other day that her return to Australia is
likely. In fact, if she can prevail on her
husband to abandon his job in the Royal
Navy and find his feet on an Australian
deck, she will be here again 18 months
hence. This belated change of plan will
encourage cynics in the belief that she never
had any serious intentions of hiding her
young talents under a bushel of mangel-
wurzels, and was merely working up a little
bit of excitement for the sake of the box-
office—with the management’s approval, no
doubt.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: “Second Murderer” (B.
7/6/’23) paints too rosy a picture of the
disappearance of the dead-broke mummer.
Some Australian actors are certainly having
a rare run of luck, but there are still many
good performers out of a “shop.” A man
who wanted pros, for a one-night show in a
Sydney suburb had no difficulty in collecting
a co. on “Commonwealth” principles—put
in your own expenses, profits to be
shared. The profits worked out at 7s. 3d.
a head, and everyone was satisfied. Why, a
man could earn 20 times as much by fitting
sliding panels in A.L.P. ballot-boxes.
“Amor Pat”: Let me tell “Old Timer”
(B. 31/5/’23) that Henry John King com-
posed the cantata which opened the Melb.
Centennial Exhibition in 1888. He won the
prize against all-comers, Leon Caron being
placed third. The judges were Dr. Torrance,
Alfred Plumpton and Max Yogrich. I was
present on the opening day, when King
conducted his own composition, Amy Sher-
win singing the soprano part. Frederick
Cowen conducted the second performance of
King’s work, and also his own composition,
“A Song of Thanksgiving.” Cowen had been
engaged in London to conduct orcnestral and
choral concerts for six months, his fee being
£5OOO. Chagrined at his failure to win first
prize Caron’s friends got some suburban
choir to give a performance of his cantata,
and presented him with a gold baton to
soothe his feelings.
“Rienzi”: I thought Bernard Shaw in
“The Doctor’s Dilemma” had produced the
most painful caricature of a working press-
man, but I think the pastry must be awarded
to Fryn Tennyson Jesse, the author of “Quar-
antine,” now at Melbourne King’s. She pre-
sents an American member of the Fourth
Estate who is at once disqualified as an
intelligent human by being christened Cyrus
Pj; Honks. But when he talks you know
that he Has graduated for his profession
from a bleacher’s perch at a Yankee ball
game. On the evidence of his conversation
it seems doubtful if he could compile, with-
out error, the guest announcements and
approaching marriages in the social columns
of our worst-written dailies. I don’t sup-
pose the profession minds being caricatured ;
but when the pictures are invariably _ pre-
sented, not as caricatures but as portraits, a
protest seems to be almost due.
~“M.P.A.,” from N’York: —
C. E. Hersdhell is a hero if he expects to find a
buyer in London for his 3000 ft. film of “The
Great Ocean-road” (B. l/3/’23). While lie
was turning the handle of his camera along
the track from Geelong to Warrnambool there
were hundreds of men doing the same thing
in far more picturesque places. Gaumonts put out
an Amazon film in London, and it fell with a thud.
Yet. the Amazon is a much more romantic subject
than an Australian coastal road. There are Bur-
mese, Chinese, Malay, African and the Lord knows
what other films on the market, and the producers
cannot sell more than a few feet at 6s. per foot.
Everyday scenics won’t fetch the price of eggs. But
possibly in his jaunt along the Ocean-road Herschell
snapped a cannibal feast, or a party of motorists
pursued by ravenous wallabies, or a platypus in a
10-round bout with a cassowary. If so, he has a
winner.
“S.T.S.”: Marie Lohr’s latest success in
London, “Aren’t We All?” seems to be
mainly remarkable because an Australian
in it is a gentleman. Hitherto the British
stage has held, even more strongly than the
British Army, a firm conviction that Aus-
tralians are “stout fellows, but, of course,
socially impossible.” Perhaps the author
(Frederick Lonsdale) made this one all right
out of compliment to the actress-manager;
and the fact that he is played by our old
friend Martin Lewis guarantees his having
the required varnish.
“Orb”: In saying that Charles Kenning-
ham wrote the words of the ode sung by
Nellie Stewart at the opening of the Com-
monwealth Parliament (B. 7/6/’23), “Nor-
bell” understated the case. Kenningham
composed both words and music of the ode
—he called it a “hymn.” Had some energetic
music-publisher pushed that “hymn,” it
would have been sung in every school in
the Commonwealth, and, in my judgment,
there would have been no argument as
to what is the National Anthem of Aus-
tralia.
“Abbot Park”: Everyone to his taste, but
surely “J.F.H.” (B. 31/5/’23) Ls wrong in
classing “Measure for Measure” as the
Bard’s most “unpleasant” play. My selec-
tion is “Titus Andronicus.” Its savage mur-
ders, violations, mutilations and other acts
of barbarism make stage representation im-
possible. Consider the last words of Aaron
the Moor, before his horrible exit
If one good deed in all my life I did,
I do repent it from my very soul.
Oscar Asclie and Lily Brayton played
“Measure for Measure” in London about 15
years ago, with Asche as Angelo. It hasn’t
been done in Australia as far as I know.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : Though a success in
N’York, the new German scheme of stage-
setting and lighting has crashed in London.
The idea is to divide the stage into com-
partments or storeys, in one or more of which
the action proceeds, the rest of the stage
being inhabited by unseen scene-shifters get-
ting things ready for subsequent acts. In-
stantaneous changes are effected by whisk-
ing the lights from one section of the ground-
floor to another, or from the first storey to
the second. In “Angelo,” the incoherent but
brilliantly spectacular production at Drury-
lane, 40 scenes were submitted in rapid suc-
cession. But it didn’t take on.
“The Deacon”: When Bill Sole and
Charlie Eroni were killed by the explosion
of their acetylene plant at Blayney
(N.S.W.) two circus families were put into
mourning. The Eronis, under their right
name of Perry, used to take a small outfit
round the bush townships. Sole was put
on the circus map by a greyhound called
Whisky, which could jump a 20ft. hurdle
from a springboard. Bill married a Perry
girl, and their amalgamated show gave Wirth
Bros, the only serious rivalry they have en-
countered in the circus business since the
Fitzgeralds’ day.
HIS FLIGHT OF GENIUS.
THE TRAGEDIAN: “I played Hamlet, my boy.
Had a great run."
THE COMEDIAN: “Did they catch you?"
“Orb”: It’s really wonderful how expedi-
tiously the touring tent-theatre is got ready
for action. Cows may be grazing on the
“pitch” at 1 p.m. when the co. arrives, yet
at 7 o’clock tickets will be on sale in the
vestibule of a well-appointed canvas Covent
Garden, with good seating for over a thou-
sand. carpets down in the aisles, and stage,
scenery for a thriller, act drop, elec-
tric lights and all the rest of it in working
order. But the outfits are wearing on the
proprietor. A gust of wind may do hun-
dreds of pounds of damage in five minutes.
Hoilyford s Pavilion Theatre was having
a great spin in Newcastle (N.S.W.) a few
years back when a squall blew the tent tc
smithereens and wrecked the stage and scen-
ery. Bits of the tent were scattered over
the landscape, and every kid in the neighbor-
hood took mum home a verandah-blind
or the material for a canvas deck-chair. A
new tent was erected in a day or two, but it
was only up a couple of hours when it, too,
was ribboned.
SIMPLE.
“ Isn’t it wonderful how she can make her-
self look so miserable, and she gets fifty
thousand a year they say!"
“Easy. She's only got to think of her in-
come-tax."
“Norbell”: “Crispie” (B. 7/6/’23) coin-
plains of the laugh raised on the vaudeville
stage by the mention of Footscray. All the
capitals of the Commonwealth have their
stock-joke suburbs. Perth has Subiaco;
Brisbane, Woollongabba; Sydney, Botany,
and so on. Why these places are funny no
one knows. There is an iron convention
about stage witticisms. A vaudeville com-
edian would “get the bird” if he didn’t work
in (1) the mother-in-law, (2) mixed bathing,
(3) twins, (4) the lodger, (5) coming home
drunk, (6) cheese, sausages or beer, (7)
ladies’ underclothing. There are only seven
jokes, just as there are only seven plots.
It’s hard to squelch indurated tradition, and
I’m afraid Footscray must continue to know
how sublime a thing it is to suffer and be
strong.
“Private Boxer”: One of Shalcspeare’s
American collaborators, mentioned by “First
Old Man” (B. 7/6/’23), has appeared on
Australian bills. Elmer Rice, as he now
calls himself, was Elmer Rietenstein when
he wrote “On Trial,” a riot in the U.S.A.,
but a much quieter 'disturbance in this
country. The war changed a lot of things,
including names.
“C. Oekney”: “Fleet Street” (B. 7/6/’23 )
quotes a Lloyd’s Weekly editorial which
“supposes” that the fashion of nigger pro-
ductions was begun by Oscar Asche. Lloyd’s
shouldn’t “suppose.” Long before Asche did
“Kismet” George Musgrove had a company
of coons playing “In Dahomey ” at London
Shaftesbury. Mild protests against the coal-
black invasion were made by English mum-
mers, but there was more work offering in
those days and the eullud ladies and gents,
weren’t seriously disturbed. When Musgrove
wanted to bring “In Dahomey'’ to Australia
there was a different tale to tell. After con-
tracts had been signed he was bluntly told
by Authority that his darkies weren’t wanted
in this part of the worlu, and the trip was
cancelled.
“Schnorrer” sets out some new history:—
The “Queen of Sheba” film, now introduced to
Australia, seems to be largely built upon the
material supplied by ancient Abyssinian MSS., the
“Kebra Wagast,” which reached the British Museum
after the storming of Magdala by British troops in
1868. The “strong” of the story is that Abyssinia
collared the real Ark of the Covenant from Israel
and left a duminy in its place-—a happening which
was hushed up by the custodians of the Temple that
Solomon built. It happened thus. Makeda was a
lady who did not belong to Abyssinia, and despised
the various mates offered to her; she seems to have
journeyed to Solomon not so much to sample his
wisdom as to secure a distinguished father for the
next Abyssinian king. Having accomplished this,
and when her son was grown to manhood, she
despatched him on an expedition to see his father;
and the Abyssinian record states that Solomon
offered to make him his own heir if he would
remain. But Menyelik (the son) declared that he
was pledged to return; whereupon Solomon decreed
that each Jewish family should supply its eldest son
to accompany the visitor back to his own kingdom.
These youths plotted together to take the Ark with
them, making an imitation of the original to leave
in its place; and, although the substitution was dis-
covered and a pursuit followed, the robbers got dean
away. The story (apart from the legend about the
Ark, which is missing, anyway) has some support
from the fact that there are two distinct castes in
Abyssinia and the higher caste maintains the Jew-
ish hygienic laws, including circumcision. Moreover,
they preserve the Torah.
“L.H.P.”: “Theodora” on the screen re-
minds me of “Theodora” on the stage. Sar-
dou’s patchwork drama was introduced to
Australia by Sarah Bernhardt on July 30,
1891, at Sydney Royal. The incidental
music was by Massenet, whose operas Aus-
tralia has yet to hear. The English version,
by Robert Buchanan, was presented 13 years
later at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Tittell
Brune took the name-part, and was sup-
ported by Gaston Mervale as the Emperor
Justinian, Roy Redgrave as Andreas, A. E.
Greenaway as Marcellus, Mabel Lane as
Antonina, and Jeffrey Williams as General
Belisarius. Roland Watts-Phillips, so long
with George Rignold, told me that her father
produced a drama called “Theodora, Actress
and Empress,” at the Surrey Theatre, Lon-
don, in 1806, under the management of Wil-
liam Creswick. Avonia Jones, who came
here with G. V. Brooke, was Theodora. When
Buchanan’s version was first performed at
the London Princess’s in 1890, a den of lions
was introduced in the set showing “The
Vaults Beneath the Hippodrome.” The
beasts proved a great draw, and were still
with the show when I saw it on tour at
Newcastle-on-Tyne.
“H.E.R.” : I saw an Australian-made pit-
cher at Yeppoon (Q.) 27 years ago. It
arrived per waggonette, on one side of which
was a printed invitation to “Come and Hear
the Wonderful New Invention, the Phono-
graph,” and on the other a promise that “An
Animated Picture of Local Life Will Be
Shown.” The imagination of the whole town
was fired, and everybody flocked to the
schoolhouse to listen and behold. For a
start the “Professor” gave us a 30-minute
lecture on the possibilities of the. talking-
machine. Then we heard the thing in action
—a weird, scratching, rasping noise, like the
turning of a rickety windlass. Another 30
minutes listening to the “Professor’s” ex-
planation of how pictures were made to
move, and then we saw the local film. It
was projected from an ordinary magic-
lantern, and proved to be the black silhouettes
of a number of bulldog-ants, which the
showman had captured from a local ant-nest
and imprisoned between two glass slides,
leaving space enough for the ants to move.
When the glass grew hot the ants went mad
and killed each other in their little hell. The
milk buckets were rattling when the “Pro-
fessor” moved on next morning.
“Nero”: There’s a cat in the Dunedin
(M.L.) theatre which generally manages to
walk on while drammer is being assaulted
in that city. It made its debut with the H.
B. Irving crowd in “Jekyll and Hyde.” The
other night, when Allen Doone was playing
“In Old Donegal,” the animal arrived in its
usual nonchalant manner, but instead ol
strolling off it jumped on the table and
scoffed Doone’s supper, which was an im-
portant item in the piece. The action was
held up while “Props” charged the nearest
pub and requisitioned a slab of corned beef.
“Second Murderer”: “I never in all my
natural struck such a hard-doer as old
Hyphen-Howler,” remarked Mr. Montague
Stormer. “We were on tour in Noo South
with ‘Torn from the Altar,’ and were work-
ing up the Western line. Of course Mrs.
H.-H., Gwladys Stanhope, y’know, was play-
ing leads. A bit temperamental, but straight
as a gun-barrel, we all thought. But y’never
can tell. She got playing leads with our
advance rep., and at Orange the pair cleared
out for parts unknown. The mob kidded me
to tell the old man. I broke the news as
gently as possible, and then stood from under,
expecting a King Lear-cwm-Othello explosion.
Not a bit of it! The old boy finished his
whisky-and-soda, and said quietly, ‘Gone off
with voung Blinker, has she? D—d bad
taste, ‘l call it!’ Then suddenly realising
the full force of the dreadful blow, ‘Merciful
Heaven!’ he yelled, ‘I wonder if he billed
Dubbo; before he cleared !’ ”
“S.T.S.”: To use an overworked phrase
correctly for once, the verse by “Remus” (B.
31/5/’23) on the things children of to-day
learn at the movies is Too True. I never
drop into a wet-Saturday-afternoon show
without marvelling at the quickness of the
mostly-kid audience in picking up the tine
points of intrigue and crime. Lately, a film-
character was murdered. The guilty man
dropped his handkerchief near the body; it
was kicked aside and overlooked by
everybody, but always remained visible
to the audience. The hero of the
story was wrongfully arrested. The body was
carried away. When all was quiet, the hero’s
friend came along and sat down to think the
matter out. Presently his head began to
turn in the direction of the handkerchief,
and before his eyes even rested on it there
was a general outburst of laughter _ and
cheering in childish tones. “The little inno-
cents’ minds” had leapt “swifter than a flea”
to the value of the rag as evidence, and the
necessary consequences of its being espied
at last.

FOX
f
j A Tailoring Offer
of Great Importance
at LOWE’S.
We are making this offer for two
weeks only. Our aim in so doing is
to still further popularise “Fox’s”
famous No. 1)9 Serge, of which Lowe’s
have secured the sole rights of distri-
bution.
Often a desire of this sort is impracti-
cable on account of the smallness of
stocks. In this case, however, the arrival
of an additional thirty pieces has given
us a practical opportunity to make the
offer, secure in the assurance that
every order will be fulfilled.
Thousands of suits of this material
have been made by Lowe’s, and, in
every case complete satisfaction has
been given.
The usual price of a pair of trousers
of this pure all-wool Indigo Serge be-
ing thirty shillings (30/-), it is obvi-
ous that reducing the cost to half-price
is an inducement quite out of the
ordinary.
It is also just as apparent that such
an offer, naturally, cannot be con-
tinued indefinitely. Remember, it is
positively for a fortnight only.'

COAL WASTE
How Tons are Lost Yearly through Want of
the Right Oil—in the Right Place
r j~»HE cost of coal compels a closer
1 study of the direct 1 elation be-
tween coal consumption and plant
lubrication. , .
Lubricating oils reduce friction. The
correct oil will reduce more friction
than an incorrect oil. Reduced friction
means saving of horse power Saving
of horse power means saving of coal.
Our experience shows that the
steady loss of one horse
power equals an annual
loss of three tons of coal
—often much more.
Suppose through in-
correct lubrication 100
h.p. is steadily and un-
necessarily lost. The
year ends. The treasurer
unwittingly signs
cheques for 300 or more
-OTAH,,
i#
Lubricants
jj grade for each type of service
tons of coal unnecessarily wasted — a
tidy sum. Lubrication in many plants
is slighted. The assumption is that
“almost any good oil will do."
But last year’s easy business con-
ditions have changed. Competition
is keen again. The executive realises
that he cannot afford to waste power
or buy extra tons of coal which add to
the year’s costs.
We have repeatedly
shown power users how
to conserve created and
transmitted power
through scientific lubri-
cation. Every horse
power saved means lower
production costs. If you
are interested in such
economy write now to
our nearest branch.

COBRA BALL
ESTATE.
6010 ACRES of Rich
Dairying & Cotton Land.
The Most Picturesque Estate
in Central Queensland.
SITUATED in the ROCKHAMPTON DISTRICT, Central
Queensland, the HOME OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY—as the
undermentioned results will show—2o miles from the City of Rock-
hampton, 9 miles from Yeppoon—the premier seaside resort of
Central Queensland, and 4-| miles from Bondoola Railway Station,
on the Rockhampton-Yeppoon Line
LATEST RETURNS for the present season from the Cotton
Ginneries up to and including 31st May, show:—
ROCKHAMPTON—2,423,IS2Ib. seed cotton, valued
£55,5 73.
WO WAN, DAWSON VALLEY—I,36I,3B4Ib. Seed
Cotton, valued £31,198.
SOILS.
The Estate possesses a variety of Agricultural Soil. Rich
VOLCANIC Soil on the low, undulating ridges. Beautiful, friable
BLACK SOIL and SANDY LOAM Flats, BROWN SOILS and
BROWN LOAMS on the Slopes and Ridges, and RICH ALLUVIAL
PLAINS adjoining Lake Mary, carrying a thick coat of COUCH
GRASS, which for dairying land is unsurpassed. Fully 80 per cent,
of the agricultural land requires little or no clearing, and is eminently
suited for the cultivation of the highest-grade COTTON and for
dairying and general agriculture.
WATER.
HEDLOW CREEK, which runs along one side of the Estate
and contains an enormous body of soft, fresh water up to 25 feet in
depth, and that magnificent sheet of water —LAKE MARY—form
the principal water supply, both of which are teeming with fish and
wild fowl. Hedlow Creek lends itself to irrigation. From levels
taken by the surveyor it is estimated that a large area of the adjoin-
ing sandy loam flats could be irrigated at a small expense, it being
necessary only to pump the water on to the bank, when it can be
run by gravitation over the surrounding flats, thus making the settler
independent of dry seasons. On almost any part of the Estate
permanent supplies of fresh water can be secured by sinking at
from 6ft. to 35 ft.
The Estate Has been Designed
into convenient blocks, ranging from 43 acres to 533 acres, suitable
for DAIRYING and COTTON-GROWING combined, and is
FOR SALE
at prices from £2 to £8 per acre on TERMS of One-fifth Cash and
the balance in five equal yearly payments, carrying interest at 5
per cent. CASH BUYERS will be allowed a discount of 5 per cent.
CHEAP EXCURSIONS will be run on the Queensland Rail-
ways from 1 Ith to 21 st June inclusive in connection with the
Rockhampton Carnival, and intending buyers should take this
opportunity of inspecting the Estate.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Ho notice (except of a hostile character) will b<s'
taken of communications insufficiently Humped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted ; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
S.T.H.: Don’t know why Sydney sends
its bodies to Adelaide for cremation and not to Mel-
bourne ; probably it’s because the Adelaide oven was
for a long' while the only one available, and Sydney
got into the habit. Anyhow, it’s a disgrace that bodies
should have to he sent from Sydney to either place.
. ..J.S.T.: There have been other electoral-roll discre-
pancies plenty of them. This one attracted atten-
tion because it was so huge and so sudden. .. .It.C.:
No novelty about it. But it is fairly bright Ipa:
Born dead.... Uramao: You had a chance to send a
living par, and you forward dry bones Az:
“Rhubarb” doesn’t leave a nice taste in the mouth;
and we don’t care for the mechanical rhyme-scheme
either... .Tom Hah: Think; and you jerk your
poor Muse’s head off... .W.E.C.: Yes; but it must
be first-hand information C.L.C.: Afraid we can’t
give you copyright in initials. Take a pen-name.
(P.S. Hundreds more please copy).... Gaol B.:
Very fair verse. But we’re not throwing any bricks
that way Mombak: You mislaid the humor
Baro: It moves like a three-legged giraffe....
J.G.P.W.: Your verse matches the atrocities, how-
ever shocking they have been Coleman P.; We’cl
want the statement on oath. Unfortunately we’ve
met too many rats in the regions you say were
cleared of them. .. .F.C.J.: Misses, but not by a
mile..:.A.S. (Fiji): Nearly Kat: The “Child’s”
moan is so sad that we’d feel sordid wretches
all the week if we printed it and then charged
people sixpence to hear it George F.: Not
enough there... .8.M.N.Z.: The old idea that a
farmer is an idiot worked out at tedious length....
Midas: “Beauty” hasn’t put her color on quite
skilfully enough... .L.A.J.: Wobbles along rather
heavily.... Bellerive: The autobiographical item,
deserves a place:—
If iay health did permit,
As a quaint busking clown
A living I’d earn about
The streets of the town.
In the days of my youth,
I was a humorous jay,
Made people laugh, for
Which they would pay.
Music ditties and wit
I’d nightly rehearse,
I clowned for my bread,
But I’d never for verse
My own patter and gags ;
For the game I did pen
Collected good cash and
Drank beer now and then.
.... Douglas C.: It doesn’t tickle our ears.... Joseph
W.: Moves wearily on to reach a conclusion that
eould only amuse dare-devil curates. .. .Noah: Sor-
rowful narration with no point C.A.G.C.: Tho
heroic larrikin doesn’t appeal to us R.R. (Sand-
gate) : The “Brooch” is only two-carat, and the pin
is loose. .. .R.J.C.: Makes dull reading... .E.R.C.P.;
They move us neither to blessings nor to maledic-
tions.... H.B. (Glen I.): Too melodramatic....
H.R.L.: The thought is strong ; now see if you can’t
prop up the verse —it is tottering.... Peggy O.:
Very p00r.... John F.: Not quite.... Edith D.: Thin
and rough... .Plodder: Not this time... .Quest:
“The Mad Bride” isn’t attractive.... M.R.K.: Get
the sandpaper to work on it Ox: None of them
thrill... .Norman C.: “Death” is indeed terrible. .. .
Godiva: It hasn’t the needed atmosphere... .E.M.D.:
The verse is worse than the prose, and the prose is
too bad.... Dolph Mock: Adolphus, as a poet you
are a dud.... James S.: Nothing in that to get
excited about... .P.A.R.: Dreary narration in stag-
gering verse... .F.J.S.: Finished among the ruck.
.N.D. (Parramatta): No use to man or boast.
. ...1.A.F.: A weak parody... .A.H.G.: Futile, and
badly done... .Ii.K.M.: Ancient, thin, and creaky at
the joints... .Fred A.: The idea is too frail....
A.F.E.: Descriptive verse that' gets to nothing
F.D. (Melb.) : Old yarn not improved in the telling.
. ...J.E.R.: No value.... Tener: It misses* but
there’s been many a worse shot. .. .F.J.A.: Nothing
remarkable about it. . ..G.R.L.C.: Too much melo-
drama. We’ve got a suspicion you can write better.
. ...K.H.: Both miss; but try again.... Chip:
But when Webster says it’s correct, and Carlyle

“Arev”: Since Melbourne suburban lines
have been fitted with electric trains busi-
ness people are noticing that their watches
play strange pranks. In many cases the
watch stops when its owner is in the train,
and often resumes when he alights. Per-
haps some scientist may be able to explain
why.
“H.K.”: Apropos a clerical demand that
the proceedings in the N.S.W. Assembly
should each day be opened with prayer, as
in the House of Commons, it is worth re-
calling that among the first resolutions car-
ried, following the advent of responsible gov-
ernment 67 years ago, was one moved
by Thomas Holt, that at the commencement
of each sitting the Speaker should read the
67th Psalm : “God he merciful unto us, and
cause His face to shine upon ns.” Nothing,
however, appears in the . records to show
whether the resolution was given effect to.
“Wessel”: Some of the Diggers who put
into the God-forsaken port of Dakar, in
French West Africa, have vivid recollections
of the alliance of religion and business that
they struck there. They came on a big three-
storey building run by the priest of some in-
digenous religion. The ground floor was the
church, where you could arrange with the
priest for a few prayers—which might be
needed if you went higher. On the second
floor you could get your money changed into
local currency. On the top storey there were
ways of spending it quite unnecessary to par-
ticularise.

“Whackey” : I claim this for a record in
horse-dealing. In Gisborne (M.L.) I bought
two Beaufords for Is. each, and an hour
later sold one for 10s. and the other for
4s. 6d.
“Pat Bushie” : Federal and State income-
tax returns require similar information, but
the former are printed on a small form which
goes through the post for 2d., while the other
costs 4d. As furnishing the return is com-
pulsory, why not lighten the public burden
by using a small form for the State return V
It would mean a saving in paper to the Gov-
ernment and in stamps to the taxpayer.

“Ashmead” : The Speck’s boy farm-learners
from tile Cold Country seem to be quickly de-
veloping a liking for the land of their adoption,
but there’s a fly in the ointment. These youth-
ful immigrants carry a poultice of £2ti. The
Commonwealth advanced that amount as
passage money, and the lads have to pay it
back in weekly instalments of 10 bob. That’s
about all the kids’ wages average for a start,
and when they have forked out their dues
to Ikey Government they have barely any-
thing left to call their own. Why not let
the kids have a year’s grace before paying
off? By the start of the second twelvemonth
they would have had a rise and be in a
better position to discharge their liability.

“Plain Clothes” : The newest form of petty
swindle is that practised by a youth who
has found victims among several suburban
stationers around Sydney. Explaining that
he has been too late to get a postal-note
which he wants to send away immediately,
he asks for 10 shillings’ worth of stamps. On
the plea of a lame hand he ‘gets the shop-
keeper to place the stamps in an addressed
letter, which he puts in his pocket. Then he
discovers that he has only six or seven shil-
lings. As the vendor naturally objects to
waiting for the balance, the sharper hands
back what looks like the letter, and asks
that it be held until he returns with the
cash. It is only when he fails to return that
the shopkeeper opens the letter and finds that
he has been given a dummy.

“Pat Roll”: The advance party of the
British Pacific Exploration Expedition
reached Papua recently. Lucius Connolly,
the leader, has wandered around the Central
and Gulf Divisions, absorbing local con-
ditions, while the other three members
tripped across the island from Moresby to
Buna with veteran Magistrate Fowler. Their
aim is to examine the undeveloped lands
with a view to the commercial possibilities
of timber, metals, minerals. The main body
of the expedition will follow later, and their
itinerary will be based on the results of the
present reconnaissance. Papua, with its
vast jungles, offers a wide field to investiga-
tors of this type. Gums, timber, canes, dye-
woods, clays, minerals, etc., are all objects
that are well worth the attention of pronerly
qualified investigators; at present little is
known of the numerous products that the
territory holds in her gloomy forests and
swamps.
“L.0.J.”: The telegraph delivery system
(B. 10/5/’23) is encumbered not only with
irresponsible nippers to whom the service
of messages is entrusted, but also with an
antiquated system. Following the idea that
the public should have easy access to an
office of lodgment—in the cities, at least —
the Department established many branches.
Consequently in the busiest parts of Sydney
and Melbourne almost every second block
has a receiving office handy. But instead of
having numerous delivery centres the Depart-
ment crowds that part of the traffic into two
or three offices. Melbourne’s two delivery
offices, the Central and the Rialto, handle
the whole of the city traffic except brokers’
wires. Facilities for quick delivery are just
as important as those for quick lodgment,
'and there is no reason why the present re-
ceiving depots should not be used also for
delivery. An underground pneumatic tube
connects the Rialto and the Melbourne Cen-
tral, and this or some other effective system
should be widely extended.

“Wart” on an asset Australia didn’t get:
About 1850 one Don M. A. Flores, of Arica,
Bolivia, wrote to the Colonial Office, offering to ex-
change 100 to 250 alpacas for the same number of
purebred Saxon merino sheep from the Australian
colonies. Lord Malmsbury, the Duke of Newcastle
and Lord Clarendon interested themselves in the
matter, and the letter that Lord Clarendon wrote
was published in the Van Diemen's Land Gazette.
Peru had a monopoly of the best alpacas, and strictly
prohibited their export. Flores intended to buy
the animals secretly, in small numbers, in the back-
blocks of the Andes, have them driven into Bolivia
and down to the coast, about 600 miles, where they
were to be shipped from some creeks near Arica.
He claimed to have permission from General Belger,
then President of Bolivia, and it’s quite likely he
had, as any South American republic was always
willing to injure its neighbors in any possible way.
Alexander McNaughton, of Boyle, Clark and Co.,
Hobart; Ronald Gunn, of Launceston; and R. Rer-
mode, of Mona Vale, Ross, took the matter up and
formed a syndicate to finance the venture with
shares of £lOO each. Several offered to take up
two or three shares if necessary, but R. C. Kermode
was the only one to whom was issued more than
one share—probably because most of the sheep came
from his flock. In all 30 rams and 90 ewes of the
best the Speck could produce were selected and
certified as being the progeny of sheep from the Duke
of Mecklenburg’s flock, mostly imported by the V.D.L.
Co. The Prince Regent, 235 tons, Capt. Jas. Gar-
diner, was chartered, and arrived at Arica with the
sheep, consigned to AVm. Gibson and Co., who were to
look after matters on that side. But while, the
Prince Regent was crossing the Pacific things were
happening in S. America, and before she
arrived a revolution had broken out, and Don
Flores (one of the revolutionary party, which was
defeated) had taken refuge over the Argentine border.
Peru complicated things by declaring war and invad-
ing Bolivia. The country was so disturbed that the
agents sold the sheep for what they would fetch—
-17 dollars; about what they cost in the Speck. The
buyers declared that thev had verv little hope of ever
seeing them on their inland stations. The Prince
Regert brought back a load of guano (all the docu-
ments spell it “huano”), which realised £9 10s. a
ton in Hobart. The loss on the venture was £3l2
£7 16s. a share.

Do You Use a B.S.A. Gun ?
A placid old soul set out on the Big Adven-
ture recently in Clarencetown (N.S.W.).
She was a Mrs. Sullivan, and lived almost
within cooee of the town boundary of Mait-
land for S 2 years without ever crossing it.
Neither had she ever seen a train or a ship.
The nearest approach to the latter was the
little river steamer that chugged up and
down the stream. Certainly she goes out
with an unbiased mind to whatever glories
the future may hold.
“Titun”: There is just as great a short-
age of specialist teachers of agriculture in
the Vic. Education Department as there
seems to be in N.S.W. (B. 24/5/’23). Be-
fore the war certain teachers were selected
to undergo training at Dookie and the Mel-
bourne Uni., from which they graduated
B.Ag.Sc. The Department has since dis-
continued this plan, probably because most
of these men drifted out of the Department
attracted by the better pay and conditions
of outside jobs. The lone survivor is science
master at Warragul High School, which gen-
erally tops the list in the Uni.’s public
exams, in agricultural science.
“The Deacon”: “Tay Pay’s” reference to
Geer (B. 3/5/'23) recalls another Anglican
parson who went Romewards in Sydney in
recent years. The spectacular ’verting of
little Gordon Tidy, curate at St. James’s,
Sydney’s swell tabernacle, is still remem-
bered. The small High Churchman had diffi-
culty in seeing eye to eye with the big Low
Churchman Archbishop Wrierht, and his
ritual craving found outlet in Roman Catholi-
cism. The little man with the big pipe 1 and
the ludicrous suit of hand-me-downs Was
given a junior professorship at Springwood
College (where Geer now is), and after
private study finished up in Rome, where
Cardinal Moran had found him a bursary.
But Tidy soon ’verted back to Anglicanism,
and is now settled in an English vicarage.
London note from a homesick Australian:
It was almost as good as a whiff of wattle scent to
see the name of an Australian up-country township pla-
carded on the walls of London and printed in big
capitals in widely-circulated weekly journals. Yarra-
wonga has just been enjoying) that distinction. It
came about in this way. There is a London weekly
called the News op the World, claiming a circula-
tion of a couple of millions and owned by Lord Rid-
dell, the intimate friend of LJoyd George. This paper,
in addition to specialising in spicy divorce cases,
regularly devotes half-a-page to the words and music
of one of the current popular songs in the variety
houses, the title of the song chosen being billed and
placarded in advance. The latest selection is “I’m going
hack again to Yarrawonga”—a ditty popularised here
by Ella Shields and presumably picked up by that
fascinating male impersonator during her Australian
tour. If Yarrawonga had only known in time, it
might have arranged for the simultaneous publication
of a descriptive article about its attractions and
advantages. The place is said to be the third Aus-
tralian locality to be thus celebrated in song in the
: Empire’s metropolis. The other two are Wallaroo
and Woolloomooloo.
. “Van Cat”: You can’t always judge a
sausage by its coat, or a parson either.
Among W.A. Diggers, Sprag was only known
for his proficiency as a leadswinger, and
why he ever enlisted remains a mystery, for
he had to be encouraged on to the troopship
by means of a bayonet, and spent most of
his time overseas A.W.L. or in clink. He
doesn’t wear a returned soldiers’ badge, be-
cause the unkind authorities would not give
him one. The other afternoon he was boost-
ing himself as an all-wool patriot outside a
pub in Fremantle when a Methody minister
happened to pass. Loudly and profanely the
Dig. asked to be told the reason why dinkum
soldiers like him should nave to fight for
priests and parsons, and then be neglected
by an ungrateful country. The parson for-
got about turning his other cheek, and re-
marked quietly that he was pleased to hear
that the other fellow had fought, because he
was the corporal of the guard that had
escorted him on to the boat, and he had
often wondered since what had become of
him.
This from the S. M. Herald (30/5/’23)
is—whom do you think? —Garden, the wild
upheavalist of N.S.W. Labor Council: —
Germany was passing through a period of great
depression, but there was not the unemployment that
there was in Great Britain. When trade was slack
in Great Britain or in Australia workers were thrown
' on the scrap-heap of unemployment, where nobody
cared what became of them. That was the Anglo-
Saxon way. The Teutonic way, which prevailed in
Germany, was to retain the same number of em-
ployees in a time of depression, but to reduce the
wages of all of them. In Berlin the workers were
working for very little.... The official figures showed
at the time he was there that the number of unem-
ployed in the city, which was three times the size of
Sydney, was only 105,000.
So great is Garden’s love for imperialistic
Germany (republican for the moment only
because the Allies won’t let William come
back), with its conscription, its militarism,
its spiked helmet, its junker nobility, and its
big capitalists, that he is even filled with
admiration because the latter have reduced
wages to “very little.” And to prove that
his angel-Hun doesn’t throw workers on the
scrap-heap, there are only 105,000 un-
employed and their families in a single city *
, “G.S.”: “Randolph Rentless’s” Bung-
beak was not the first who has had to fine a
sozzled customer and pay the money him-
self. The story is told on the Clarence River
(N.S.W.) of a newly-appointed J.P. who,
taking his seat on the Bench, was shocked to
find before him one of his pub patrons of the
previous evening. Sternly ignoring the pri-
soner’s friendly greeting, his Worship began:
“You’re charged with being drunk and dis-
orderly. How do you plead?” “Well,”
answered the accused, “I’ll plead guilty to
being drunk, but,” casting a contemptuous
glance at the constable, “I couldn’t have
been disorderly or I wouldn’t be here.” “Very
well,” pronounced the Bench, “we’ll let it
go at that. You’re fined five shillings.”
“Well, Mick,” said the unabashed prisoner,
“you’ll have to pay it —you know yourself
I had to stick up a round last night.’ 1 Later
the J.P., back among the bottles and glasses,
was relating the incident to an appreciative
audience. “Why didn’t you give him five
shillings or the rising of the Court, Mick?”
he was asked. “By cripes,” exclaimed Mick
in a moment of enlightenment, “I never
thought of that I took myself down for
five bob!”

Upholding the Name
It takes courage to place
quality above profit, particularly
when the reputation for quality
seems assured. To relax slightly
the standards which a clock
must meet before it can wear
the trade mark Westclox on its
dial would mean more clocks
turned out and more money
turned in.
The reputation for quality
which Westclox have established
is pushing demand ahead of our
ability to supply. No increase
in the number of Westclox
made is permitted until each
clock receives the attention and
care that entitles it to be trade
marked Westclox.

Winter’s Ills
by using
REXONA
the SKin Remedy of the Age.
Winter winds play havoc with the skin. Chapped lips,
rough faces, chilblains, cracked and bleeding hands all
result from exposure to the wind and weather, and cause an
unnecessary amount of suffering—unnecessary because
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, prevents just these discomforts by
healing the injured skin and protecting it from the evil influence
of disease germs. A small abrasion may become the germ-
infected area that threatens health itself. A timely use of
Rexona prevents small injuries from becoming painful, and
its action is so prompt that Rexona has made its name known
all over Australia as the Rapid Healer. The triangular pot,
with its healing, soft, green ointment, should be kept handy
on the dressing-table, so that every member of the family
can have access to its wonderful healing power. Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, 1/6 and 3/-.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rnHE sounds I hear are distant temple
I 1 bells,
_L Small bells that tinkle on a bullock-
cart,
And smaller bells on elephants that pass;
And the swish-swish of moving naked feet
Along the pavement sauntering in the heat,
And a tom-tom thudding like a beating heart.
At home, I know’, exultant magpies trill
Their gurgling greeting to the rosy day,
And wise-eyed laughing-jacks w’ith laughter
fill
Their merry bush-world that awakes to play ;
Through twisted she-oaks on a lonely hill
The night-wind soughs and sighs its life
away.
A herd of new-shorn sheep bleat soft their
grief.
And in the town
Cars rattle, and shod feet pass up and down.
The scents I smell are heavy temple-flowers,
Hot jungle damped by late monsoonal
showers,
And aromatic spices borne upon
A warm and languorous air;
And curry-stuffs, with garlic, cinnamon,
And lemon-scented allspice, cloves and mace,
Faint sandalwood ; and eocoanut-diled hair;
Smoke from the patna-fire; a cooking feast;
And the un-named pungent smeu of all the
East.
At home, I know, wafts on the evening
breeze
Warm eucalyptus from the dew-drenched
trees,
And distant bush-fires, and the warm sweet
scent
Of wet, dry grass.
And I remember well the smell of. sheep,
And of the reeking woolshed where they
keep
Great packs of soft and greasy wool;
The smell of wine fermenting; new-mown
hay;
And the sea-breeze after a summer’s day.
The sights I see are palms and plantain-trees,
Rubber and cocoa and the bright tea “flush,”
And paddy waving emerald-green and lush,
With gaily-colored sarees threading through
As native women go about their ways ;
Boutiques with unknown merchandise on
view,
And squatting vendors with their sweetmeat-
trays ;
An elephant and mahout, and a few
Soft-walking Buddhist priests in yellow clad,
With talipot and fan.
But there’s a shady corner of the bush
Where spider-orchids hide beneath the shade
Of great grey gums; where willow-trees have
made
A leafy-cool and shimm’ring-srreen arcade
Of weeping trailers that with gentle “ hush ”
And “ hush ” sweep through the running creek
between
And back again.
I know a great white street where cars pass
by,
And church-spires stand against the sunset
sky ;
I know a house with widely-open door
Where Mother stands. . . .
Oh, in mu heart I long
For the dear sounds andl scents and sight
of Home!
CEYLON.
WOOLMER GATTY.
Little Jenny Wren.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Harry griffiti-i left his office at
the north end of the Street of
Magic, and walked southward to
the Caravanserai for the regulation two
whiskies of the day, and then home. He had
quitted his legal business half-an-hour early
—partly because his wife, who had left him
a grass-wido-wer for a week, was to return
from Leura that day ; also because fair pro-
mises of working a plebiscite to win him
a nomination for a safe constituency had
unsettled him for the ordinary business of
a lawyer. ; Most, lawyers are merely solici-
tors—people who ask. But Griffith had in
tellect sufficient to distinguish him in his
profession, as the one-eyed man in the blind-
man’s ..asylum becomes king.
His life promised to be very full with legal
work, and the fascinating life of politics, and
dhe fact that he was in love with his wife. Mar-
ried a year to a gay, laughing, irresponsible
creature of 22, and only 30 himself, he could
not tell yet which was most to him, pro-
fessional gain or public ambition; but he.
did know that the elusive personality
he had married was so dear that he must
prevent her making a grass-widower of him
again.
And then in the vestibule of the Cara-
vanserai, near a drinking-hall which is
called a winter garden because there is never
any winter in it and gardeners aren’t ad-
mitted because they haven’t enough money,
he saw a little head he knew well —dark-
haired and delicately eared, and set on a
graceful neck that he had often found rest-
ing in the crook of his arm; insinuated
there or appropriated in the luxuriously
drowsy hours about the dawn. He was very
pleased, and then annoyed. She should have
been at home waiting, or she should have
sought him ,at the. office, immediately on
arriving in the city, rather than be here at
the entrance to the alleged winter garden,
talking with those ultra-smart young mar-
ried women whom he despised, and laugh-
ing rather too loudly at the foolishness of
the well-dressed loafer who ogled her. A
tailor’s study in pearly grey, the loafer was
so unobtrusive as to clothes that he was com-
paratively noisy as to ears and teeth.
Still, for all Griffith’s irritation, Laura
was Laura, beautiful, compelling, full of
allure; a gay, bright- companion -made for
love and laughter, but not for sickness or
the care of it, nor for bereavement or con-
dolence ; so young and so vital that around
her head the seeing eye saw that halo which
seemed to prompt her name, born of the
laurel and the air. Against his judgment,
his passion for justice-—for all that he was
a solicitor and a partisan—against his dis-
gust of any flouting of the respectabilities,
he was too much in love to be angry. She
was there, but facing away from him; he
saw at a glance the adorable shape of her, her
bodily perfection, and hoped for a mental
form to match.
“Laura,” he said softly, and she heard at
the mere whisper, and turned to him as if
in joy. «The movement satisfied him, although
she had not hurried to him immediately on
arrival from the Mountains; and as she
proved her unfashionableness by kissing him
there and then, he debited all her delay to
the observance of social amenities, and left
it at that. But little Laura couldn’t leave
it there.
“We motored down from Leura, and
Maisie asked me in to have a cocktail. So
we’ve had one, and I was just coming down
to you. Grif.”
“What about a little .drink?” asked Teeth
and Ears, who toiled not, neither did he
spin anything but yarns close up to the
knuckle. "You were just on the road home,
Mr. Griffith —join us.”
Griffith looked down at Laura’s face, now
very near to him, as Laura clasped and un-
clasped his left arm at the elbow; he saw
in her eyes not only the light of very life,
but the light of alcohol.
“No, thanks,” said Griffith; “I just came
to collect my wife.” ~
“Oh, you didn’t know I was here, Grif!
You did come in for a drink, so do go with.
us.” She even threw a little weight on to
his arm to help her persuasion, and he be-
came doubly determined to resist.
“I came here to take you home.”
The tone told her that he was the master
—not master absolutely, but just strong
enough to make her appear silly if she re-
sisted ; sufficiently sure of himself, and
therefore inevitable.
Raging against him she smiled in agree-
ment, made her farewells, and left the Cara-
vanserai with him, her ill-temper changing
to half a fear. In the street she held him
tack long enough to say, "Get a taxi, dear,”
but Griffith drew her on, tightening his arm
on hers and saying in a tone that ended
argument, “No ! Tram !”
They entered a tramear too crowded to
improve her temper; and Griffith irritated
her by his acceptance of the conditions as
natural. For, though Griffith had made her
a democrat by mere imitation of himself,
she was still' the democrat with manners
aristocratically exclusive —willing to travel
in a tramear, but desirous that there should
not be another passenger, and that the con-
ductor should be unheard,
A heavily-alcoholised person addressed
himself to space on the matter of the poli-
tical situation, and Laura Griffith, contrast-
ing the annoyance with the pleasure of the
Caravanserai and the cocktail provid'd by
the pearl-grey youth styled Teeth and Ears,
almost began to discover a grudge against
this husband who had foolishly made her
sour when she wished to be sweet.
The storm that broke after they reached
their home in childless Fla tlar:d was a
storm without heat in it; Griffith’s voice—
decorously pitched to sustain the fiction of
the absolutely sound-proof flat —was sharp-
ened with scorn that cut her lingering self-
respect as tempest tears blossom.
“I told you I wouldn’t have you going
around with that woman Hildry. She’s no-
thing but a winter-garden hack —or people
are saying so, which is as bad. And that'
girl-fool Bessie Moreton will have to wake
up. Her husband may be blind, but I’m
not. You’ve been away a week, and in-
stead of coming to me as soon as you reached
town you go with them. You should
have come to my office. I don’t w r ant
you to seek me as a matter of duty, but
I’ll have respect for my advice. I’ll have
obedience when it comes to my right to
keep my wife out of bad company.”
“But I couldn’t help it. They drove me
there, and then asked me to have a drink,
and the time went.”
“You couldn’t help it! You haven’t a
will of your own, but must give ifi to any-
body else for a moment’s gratification. It’s
a dangerous habit, and I’ll break you of it
before it smashes both our love and’ us.”
“ You’ll break me! You’ll insult me and
then threaten me ! I’ll —I’ll”——
And then, in the absence of-any plan, and
rage destroying her vocabulary, she used the
old method of defiance—went out and
slammed the door behind her.
The noise reverberated through the abso-
lutely sound-proof flat.
“Doom,” said the door, to tell Griffith that
the honeymoon had definitely ended six
months ago.
Griffith could not settle to the work he
had brought home. Also he had missed his
whisky, and his nerves were on edge, so lie
went out again. Then he softened to her
and intended to return, but he saw at the
Caravanserai Mrs. Hildry and that foolish
young wife Bessie Moreton—also childless,
as all of them were childless—and Bessie
Moreton was laughing heartily at nothing,
and Teeth and Ears was aiding and abetting.
Griffith went back home, hardened his heart,
and -would not let ill-temper go.
They held out against each other and
themselves for a week, and then suddenly
fell on each other’s neck, and one lifted up
her voice and wept, and the other said
“Darling,” and took her back where she be-
longed.
Her resolution to be good and reallv love,
honor and obey lasted as long as her fright;
or, rather, until Griffith, easy in mind again
because her promises seemed to be made
for keeps, returned to immersion in his legal
business, and sank to the subterranean places
necessary to make secure that political nomi-
nation. There were days when Griffith could
not meet her in town, and that meant that
Mrs. Hildry and little Mrs. Moreton cap-
tured her. The three lived in the one great
flat-building, and the two women came to
her flat, and she went to the flat of one
of them, and they played bridge all the after-
noon. High temperatures demanded cock-
tails. and having the reverse effect to that
sought, the idlers shed clothing until
were uniform, each in kimono that showed
more intimate garments, often daringly.
The demoralisation of character by alcohol
made them careless; so that Teeth and Ears
and another man called one day, with an-
other woman as hopeless as Mrs. Hildry.

few of us realise how precious good health is until we
begin to lose it. To be well is to enjoy life and make
good times for those around us. To be constantly ailing
is to miss life’s pleasures and to look with envy upon our
robust friends and neighbors.
Are you one of the unfortunates?
Is your health slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you
looked to your kidneys!
Much sickness of to-day is traceable to kidney weakness.
Its increase is alarming. That’s because it’s usually
unseen or neglected.
But it’s easy to tell if your kidneys are weak. You may
have only backache, dizzy spells, headaches, or annoying
bladder irregularities.
If you have these symptoms, suspect your kidneys! Remember that delay may result in serious
kidney sickness.
If you’ve reason to suspect your kidneys, read the story of these Sydney residents, who have won back
good health through Doan s Backache Kidney Pills, the world’s best-recommended kidney remedy.
Doan’s have helped thousands. They should help you! Ask your neighbor I
TWO SYDNEY RESIDENTS SPEAK.
TWO YEARS CURED.
Mr. Geo. A. Skinner, 37 Goodhope Street, Paddington, says:—“As a
result of a bad cold which settled on my kidneys, I suffered agony from
backache and was often so bad that I had to lie up, not being able to move
without enduring torture. The kidney secretions were very much disordered,
being thick and cloudy, and I could not even turn in bed without ?» stab-iike
pain striking me across the loins. I took all kinds of kidney medicines,
but nothing gave me any permanent relief, and I was at a loss to know what
to do for a cure. A friend, hearing how I was suffering, suggested I should
try Uoan s Backache Kidney Pills. I bought some at once, and after
taking them for a few days I was delighted to find they were doing me good,
in a week or so I felt ever so much better, and by the time I had used
ve or six bottles I was completely cured. That was two years ago, and
L!ft!i ’ but 1 alwa ys keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house
d take them now and again, as a tonic for the kidneys.”
SEVEN YEARS CURED.
t( rs . H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says:—
It gives me great pleasure to say a few words in praise of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kidney trouble,
the symptoms being backache, urinary disorder and dizzy attacks. My
back ached fearfully and every movement was accompanied with a twinge
like the stab of a knife. The secretions were cloudv and scalded a good
deal in passing, this symptom clearly showing my kidneys were very much
out of order. I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so
decided to give them a trial. The first bottle gave me relief, and by the time
I had used three bottles I was cured, and I have been well ever since, a
period of over twelve months.”
Six years later Mrs. Sturgeon says:—“My cure still holds good, no
sian of kidney disorder having returned since I took Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills seven years ago.”

After tnat they came often, and deshabille
became more pronounced, mure allegedly
artistic and certainly alluring.
One day a big man with the marks of the
great plains and searching sunlight on him
interrupted their bridge party at Mrs. Hil-
tjry’s flat. He was the almost-forgotten Mr.
Hildry. He said something to Mrs. Hildry
about divorce, and then on general prin-
ciples, and with great contempt for guod
form, he rewarded the presence of Teeth
and Ears by punching that gentleman vio-
lently on the nose.
Laura, with a new fear flogging her, ran
down to her own flat, swearing to be good
if she were only not found out this time. So
she was very subdued, and very loving; and
the weary man thanked God for the comfort
of her.
A month of security, and Squirrel-brain
rorgot danger again. Bridge had palled, but
there is always the draper, who original y
began business in Paradise as “Serpent,
Limited, Modes et ltobes.” There were per-
feetly-divine bathing-suits, for atmospheric
bathing only—silk and satin, and hose, and
sandals, and ballet-skirt, which water must
not touch. Griffith returned early and found
her dressed in them —pink silk that made
her look naked, and a cap of pink and pale-
blue silk. And lie behaved quite unreason-
ably—asked her what they were for, and
when told their use swore that he would not
permit her to keep them. When he found
the cost of the foolishness was 10 guineas
he was even more unreasonable. And in
the end she retaliated, first by calling him
wowser and then by expressing virtuous
indignation at his “meanness.” Then, to
escape cross-examination, and to put him in
the wrong, she banged the door again.
That trouble lasted . a fortnight, and by
the time of reconciliation she had resumed
the intimacy with Mrs. Hildry and little
Mrs. Moreton and half-a-dozen new acqua'nt-
anees, all young married women, all child-
less loafers ; idlers through life, Cursing the
men of their choice with their extravagance,
taking the fun and paying never the foe.
Mrs. Hildry was accompanied bj’ a new
man now, Teeth and Ears having accepted
the punch on the nose as an insinuation
against his popularity; and Laura happened
to be in Mrs. Hildry’s flat the day that lady
was served with divorce papers. Quite hor-
rified at the suggestion of the justice of such
a thing, Laura made a record run for home,
and this time determined on absolute reform-
ation. In the fear of some real disgrace
which would attach to her husband and mean
the losing of him, the thoughts of him became
very tender. They had been real friends
for a month now, and were getting back to
the early trust and intimacy of the waned
honeymoon. She rehearsed pretty speeches
for his arrival: and he arrived, not as lover,
but as judge.
“I got that draper’s bill to-day,” he said.
" You didn’t send back that comic-opera
bathing suit as I told you to do.”
“But I’d worn it!”
“Have you worn it since? Have you?
Yes, you have—with that Hildry-Bessie
Moreton gang, and all the rest of the
wasters’ You have? I knew it. And
you were .n Mrs. BLldry's iiai to-day when
me uitone papers were served on her'?”
“On, 1 wasn c. How did you know?”
“A lie and the adnussxon of it in the one
breath. Im Hildry’s solicitor, and the
man who served the papers got from the
maid the names of the people wffio were in
the flat, and put your name in his report
without any idea of connecting you with me.
I couldn t leii you how baa that Hildry
woman was. 1 torn you to keep away from
her, and you let me behove you oueyed—you
cruel, ungrateful liar. I’ve given you every-
thing i coum, ana tried 10 maim you nappy,
and you couldn’t even obey me when I told
you to avoid mat woman ior your own good.
You could deceive me and lie to me, and
laugh to know you’d fooled me.”
“Oh, I didn’t laugh at you, really. I w r as
afraid to tell”
“You were not afraid to deceive. You
shan’t drag me down as that creature dragged
down Hildry.”
“How dare you say that to me?”
“I’ll say noth.ng hiore to you. I’m
finished.”
“But Grif.”
“I hate a liar, and I’m finished.”
Then he had gone out again, and next
morning she crawled to him utterly beaten,
ready to be forgiven. But Griffiih silently
freed his coat from her fingers and left the
house.
And then she knew she had lost, and,
being friendless, thought at once of the
mother to whom she had not even written
for a month. The maid helped her pack,
and took her baggage to the tram ; she had
booked for the Melbourne express that night,
and called at her husband’s office to tell him
so, and the reply was that he would be en-
gaged all the afternoon. So Laura wrote
a letter at the flat and waited there for him
until there was danger of losing the train,
and so departed out of his life.
Griffith read her letter, and was glad she
had gone to her mother, and then engaged in
that most difficult of literary practice—the
writing of a letter of which Mother-in-law shall
be editor. But he knew that she knew, and
that she liked him and would defend him
against her daughter, she being still sane.
Griffith left Mother-in-law to forgive all by
understanding all, and his letter was merely
to the point of stating that funds would be
provided for maintenance. That done, he
dived into work again—-legal business that
doubled its volume every month by the adver-
tisement of one success; and political skat-
ing of much delicacy.
Laura had been eating husks for two
months, when the Hildry divorce came on,
and Hildry got his decree. She read the
report with new' understanding of happenings
which had seemed harmless and had been
criminal. She saw that Grif had known
all the evidence when he was trying to
advise her, and she had refused to become
controlled—as impatient then of instruction
as she was now eager to be mastered. She
wrote him, but not all that, hating to give
herself away in any other manner than to
collapse in his arms, while remarking that
she was adamant and unalterably the cap-
tain of her soul. She merely said she
wanted him, and would he come over for
per.' And he replied that he was very busy.
And so he was. He was to appear for
young Moreton (now almost old Moreton
from grief) in a case against a harpy who
had murdered Bessie Moreton —her sacrifice
to the childless conuinou Her husband nad
wondered at. Laura read the report of that
case and shuddered at the exit of these two
who had been her n-;ends, and then sue wrote
to Gnf again, asking if she might come home
o be good —until she had got over the next
,'rghc. »
He did not reply to that. He knew her
nature —little Jenny Wren sick, and graci-
ously permitting herself to be tended.
But when Jenny Wren got well
She stood upon her feet
And loved Cock Robin ne’er a bit.
She was not to be trusted. Her letters
showed no sorrow but the sorrow of conven-
tion ; for him to permit her to come home
she must first qualify by a long probation, re-
sulting in stronger evidence of her betterment.
L.ke most other women’s letters, hers did
not say she was sorry for wrongdoing; she
left the sorrow and the recognition of the
wrongdoing to be read into the letter by
the reader; and Griffith didn’t know enough
to know that this is as far as almost all
women will permit themselves to go in their
amateur imitation of a gentleman apologis-
ing when he finds himself in the wrong. So
another fortnight dropped into eternity
Without a meeting.
And then something happened to make
Griffith more lonely—the winning of the
plebiscite by a human ferret who won the
nomination by being subterraneanly superior ;
and, to give him a more exacting conception
of duty, the sight of a little woman who
had been one of the Hildry bridge-parties
and one of Laura’s friends going express to
the Devil because her overtried husband had
withdrawn himself to teach her a lesson, in
ignorance of the fact that his absence was
teaching her another.
So Griffith began to accuse himself of con-
tributory negligence, and concluded that,
although he was not the incendiary, he was
certainly helping the fire by cutting the hose.
Then Griffith put himself into the Melbourne
express, and moved without notice to the
Opposition, which was Laura.
She came running out to him as she heard
his voice, and before the maid could take his
name in for trial; and she was altogether
adorable. Griffith had been determined on
a new and rigid business understanding—
determined to argue the matter to its end
and forgive the charming offender once she
cried “Feccavi.” But the beloved person-
ality of her put his brain out of action. He
could only feel that she was there and be
glad of her. She clung to his left arm,
destroying the just balance of her virtues
and her faults. She drew him into the house
and to the little sitting-room.
He forgot the homily, the cross-examina-
tion of the criminal, the address to the jury,
the recital of the prisoner’s earlier convic-
tions, and the sentence. He forgot all other
sentences, too. But woman is one of those
temperamental actors who alter the author’s
text ; and Laura was one of them who throw
away the entire script, and then speak in
dumb show.
She released hl’s arm and imprisoned his
neck, and Griffith lost all his judicial quality
and remembered only her lips. But th<
necessity for an understanding was sti!
strong in him, and when he came to the sur-
face ior air, he saw piled on the little wori
table the pink silk of that damnable bathW
suit for atmospheric use. It had been tie
last irritant that had made their separation
She was quite incurable, then, relying on
lus senses to sway his mind, even in essen-
Lials.
“That damned thing agan ! I told you to
get rid of it.”
Laura laughed, left his arms and lift*;
two or three folds of it, and he saw it was
in pieces. Then she dropped all but tie
piece of silk atop and that she held befor,
him.
It was a very small dress for a very smai
baby—full descript.on not entered on the
manifest until arrival.
Griffith moved; and the lecture was taken
as read.

Warm breath of new-made bread, the sharp,
sweet scent
Of butter on a morning full of green,
With wood-smoke rising and the near bright
sheen
Of still lake waters indolently bent
About white shores. Day’s early silver spent
Had brought the Orient jade of some dark
queen
To cast in shadow where the high cliffs lean
From the slate ridges in their steep descent.
We came into the town of little shops,
And lurking dim arcades of quiet tones.
Motes danced within a light-ray; and the
brown
Of velvet dust was full of golden drops
From diamond panes that, like the cobble
stones,
Were old as the grey chimneys of the town.
11.
New smoke, new bread, new butter and new
light.
No wave of all the lake was twelve months
old;
The soft, warm air the shadows sought to
hold
Was born amid the mountains yesternight.
Heedless, we brought new laughter and new
sight,
Cast down a piece of newly-minted gold
On the brown counter where old wares were
sold—
Old, lustrous things that young hands dusted
bright.
Tourists were we with tickets for return
To other scenes rock-old and morning-new—
Ancient as coal-grit and as fresh as steam...
I wonder if some day my thought shall yearn
Backward through memory again to view
The town of Life beside the lake of Dream,
x.s.w.
