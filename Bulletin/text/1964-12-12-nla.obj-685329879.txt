HOSE
The United States has announced the
development of the super jet, the Lock-
heed A-11. This top-secret aircraft,
years ahead of even the TFX, is con-
structed mainly of titanium. Major source
of titanium is rutile and Australia has
almost 90 per cent of world supplies.
Goodyear comes right into the picture
with the important part Goodyear hoses
play in the reclamation of this important
mineral.
There’s no tougher job for hose than
handling mineral sands, goodyiar handies
if better than any other hose in the world.
Abrasion rides high as mineral sands grind their way from
sea-bed to concentrate plant. Day in, day out millions of tons
of sand travel through Goodyear Material Conducting Hose.
Because of their outstanding endurance, their amazing longevity
under rubber-rending pressure, Goodyear Material Conducting
Hoses are chosen by the Associated Minerals Group. Through
Goodyear hose comes the vital materials to send the world’s
fastest planes hurtling through the sky.
Twenty ft. length of 8 in. Material Conducting Hose operating on
the dredge line of Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd., Cudgen,

TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout —its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and iess fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.
See your TOYOTA dealer—he has what you want in trucks
TOYOTA Lite-Stout is available with either steel tray
(List Price £955 plus tax), wooden tray (List Price £965
plus tax) or cab and chassis (List Price £BB5 plus tax).
Girder-type chassis makes Lite-Stout especially suitable
for mounting special bodies.

Today you have it!
At the moment you read this, busy
executives throughout the world will be
welcoming the new I.C.T Series 1900.
Here at last is a complete range of
systems that takes all the risks out of
choosing a computer—now, and for
always.
WHY? Because the Series 1900 is
geared to the needs of your organisa-
tion: as your needs expand so does the
1900 system. Expansion is therefore
smooth and your initial investment
stays safe and sound in the years
ahead. You have the widest choice of
systems available at the most com-
petitive'prices, ranging from approxi-
mately £45,000 to over £1,000,000. Rental
terms can also be arranged.
THE 1900 GIVES YOU HIGHER PRO-
DUCTIVITY PER £ INVESTED THAN
ANY OTHER COMPUTER.
NEW FEATURES: Multi-programming
facilities increase up to four times the
productivity of the Series 1900. Other
money-saving features include a com-
plete range of random access and
visual display devices. A built-in Master
programme called Executive finds the
quickest, most economic way of dis-
tributing work load.
The I.C.T standard interface—which
enables all the peripherals to work
with all the processors—is a major
advance in computer techniques.

Possible Bonanza
T orne Greene, of television’s “Bon-
I anza”, has returned to the United
[States after his short Australian tour
i*'ith a copy of Joyce Batty’s book,
Namatjira— A Wanderer Through Two
Vorlds”. Mrs Batty wants the former
Shakespearian actor to play the part of
jamatjira in a film version of the book,
jlf that sounds ludicrous, listen to Joyce
fatty’s comparison of the film cowboy
the late Aboriginal artist.
“They have almost identical features,”
s he says. “Greene has the same resonant
'Nee, the same dark eyes, broad nose
3 nd beautifully defined mouth as Albert,
make-up, it would be hard to tell
Rem apart.”
Mrs Batty picked Greene out as a
possible Namatjira while watching “Bon-
anza” and sent him a copy of her book
soon after it was published, but it went
astray. When the Canadian-born actor
stopped briefly at Adelaide airport on his
way to Perth, Mrs Batty presented him
with another copy. He read some of it
and his wife read all of it before they
returned to Adelaide, where Mrs Greene
said it was one of the best parts her
husband had come across.
Greene said the idea of playing
Namatjira was immensely appealing, but
he had filming commitments for several
months and it would be some time before
he could make a feature film. Joyce
Batty is not worried by time. “I’m pre-
pared to wait five years if necessary,”
she says. Meanwhile, at Greene’s re-
quest, she is at work on a shooting script
and scenario.
Down to Scale
TpHE high cost of opera houses remains
A a touchy subject in New South
Wales. Last year the Public Works De-
partment, aiming to show to what end
£17.5m. or more is being spent on the
Sydney Opera House, commissioned
Finecraft Scale Models Pty Ltd, of
Crow’s Nest, to make a big model of it.
This perfectly detailed miniature, built
to a scale of i-inch to the foot, was
shown recently at a Sydney store, and
it was there that our eye was caught by
a notice saying that the project cost
£4400 and took 53 weeks to complete.
It seemed a low price for such precision
craftsmanship, and we wondered if per-
haps the economics of building model
opera houses was a touchy subject too.
We went along to Finecraft to ask.
Brothers Bruce and Ross Usher are the
working managers of the company. They
smiled when we said the model seemed
cheap. “It was built to a firm price,
unfortunately, and unlike the real
thing,” Bruce Usher said. “It took
longer and was harder than we expected.
There are six of us here worked on it,
and £4400 spread over six blokes over
53 weeks doesn’t pay the basic wage.
Still, we have no regrets; we didn’t tender
for this job—we were asked to build it.”
They were full of enthusiasm for
Utzon’s design, and for the way the
engineering problems are being met. “A
fantastic building!” Bruce Usher said,
with warm professional fellow-feeling.
“People who criticise it have no idea.”
Model-making has engaged the Ushers
since 1947, when they made a Convair
for TAA. Many aircraft have come

Modern Japan
TNie Adelaide University Theatre
*- Guild, which has had something of
i monopoly on Patrick White play premi-
ses, has run out of supplies. Accordingly,
fin February it will turn to another local
[playwright, Hal Porter, and give the first
'performance of his second play, “Toda-
Isan”.
Porter will produce the play himself.
jToda-san” is set in modern Japan in an
inn run by an Australian ex-actress whose
brother is a professor of literature at a
lapanese university. Porter is doing the
production somewhat against his own
iidgment, as most authors do, but
mainly perhaps because he wants to make
sure that the play doesn’t get a paper-
chrysanthemum, Madame Butterfly treat-
ment.
j After the first night in February Porter
jwill leave for Japan, where he formerly
(lived as a member of the Occupation
forces, for a two months’ tour lecturing
on Australian writing under the auspices
of the Department of External Affairs.
JHe will go from Japan to England for a
production of “Toda-san” at the Hamp-
stead Arts Theatre which produced his
(first play, “The Tower”.

Phe farce cult is now as firmly en-
I trenched in London as the satire
dustry was a short time ago. The
itional Theatre has disinterred Noel
oward’s “Hay Fever”, and the Royal
part has dug up Ben Travers’ “The
[uckoo in the Nest”. It is easy to imagine
ward’s amusement, the mandarin smile
I the bald face, at finding himself in
s own lifetime embalmed as a writer
“modern classics”. But if the English
i'll come at “Hay Fever” at their tax-
yer-subsidised national theatre they
11 come at anything.
So. it seems, will Sydney’s Old Tote
leatre, that branch office of the Bristol
id Vic or the Birmingham Rep. The
'ld Tote has announced that it will pro-
jjce “Hay Fever” and send it to Orange
yr that city's festival in February, to be
flowed by a 10-week tour of country
litres such as Albury, Narrabri and
leniliquin.

Intrigued with a classified advertise-
ment offering a boat for sale for
410,000 we went to a dilapidated Sydney
fry wharf and climbed aboard the 63ft
Werican ketch Ululani to meet skipper/
|'ner Benjamin Moore. Showing us over
- impressively shipshape craft, Moore,
jformer schoolteacher, told us his vessel
r s a direct descendant of the old
fankee clippers and Gloucester
*boners.
[ But if Ben Moore has the romance of
r Cape Horners built into his craft, he’s
r content to leave it at that. Ululani
Hhe name means “Unfolding rose”
f°m the Polynesian sports a 150 h.p.
diesel, refrigeration, electric stove with
rotisserie, automatic pilot, depth finder,
fire-extinguishing system and the pumps
of a destroyer.
Formerly owned by a General Motors
president, he bought her in 1962 and
sailed from Los Angeles calling at Hono-
lulu, Tahiti, Samoa, Fiji and New Zea-
land before coming to Sydney.
How can he bear to part with her?
“Well, when I bought Ululani, I thought
my work was over and I had visions
of relaxed sailing for the rest of my
days. But I soon discovered that keeping
a boat up to her peak is a never-ending
job. I’ve worked so hard and so long I’ve
just about come to the end of my tether.
I couldn’t bear to see her deteriorate so
I’d like to find someone who can spend
the time and energy needed to keep her
at her peak.”
Wasn’t £30,000 an awful lot of money?
He shrugged, “It’s a price I’d get easily
in the States, only I don't feel up to sail-
ing her back. I’d be content to consider
a property exchange. They tell me pro-
perty’s a pretty good investment out here
and I have to have something to see me
through my old age.”
Little People
A few days ago we ran into artist
George Finey, as ebullient as ever.
He was looking around for an Irish
sponsor for an exhibition just completed
and dedicated to “the little people”. “It
must be someone Irish,” he insisted.
“Only they would treat it with due
reverence.
“I’ve actually got three exhibitions in
cotton wool,” he said, “one of religious
paintings, one finger work of varied sub-
ject matter and the third made up of
300 paintings, all very ‘little’. The largest
is 3in. by 4in. Most are an inch square.
I’ve used Puca the black horse as a
recurring theme. I thought those Irish
whisky people might be interested.
They’ve shown a bit of imagination in
their New Yorker advertisements.”
Finey, who gets more and more like
one of the little people himself, said his
paintings haven’t taken up all his time.
He’s three-quarter way through an auto-
biography tracing his career from New
Zealand to Sydney and the early days
of black and white. He hopes to have it
in the hands of a publisher shortly.
Model Girl
modelling school can make a girl
a lady,” Miss Margot McKendry
told us firmly. “Besides, modelling is
such a mentally unrewarding job. It’s
only the side effects that are worth while
the travel, meeting new people, finding
out what the world is really like. Apart
from that it’s just a matter of adding up
your hours and counting your money.”
Miss McKendry now counts her
money at a flat rate of 60 dollars an
hour in New York. Now back in Sydney
on a family visit, Miss McKendry finds
some changes in the local modelling scene
since she left here some years ago. “The
girls have realised that photographers
have been taking advantage of them for
too long, professionally, I mean,” she
said. “If equipment isn't working and
models are kept waiting they get time
and a half after 5 p.m., so there’s been
an end to a lot of slave labor.”
NO SLAVES ON BRITISH SOIL?

SO Years Ago: December 13, 1884
HTwo or three weeks ago there came
-*■ to a Cooktown homestead a party
of the original possessors of the soil,
who civilly asked the settler for
tobacco and “tucker”. With charac-
teristic generosity he promptly re-
fused them. Then they offered to
trade off a black boy for the desired
articles. After some spirited cnaffer-
ings, the boy was handed over for five
figs of tobacco, a couple of dampers,
two pipes, and three trinkets—a very
good bargain for his parents, as he
rejoined them immediately his new
owner had turned his back. But not
so good a bargain either, for the
energetic wife of that speculative
settler caught the boy by the wool and
chained him to a log for two days and
two nights. At the end of that time
he was civilised. He was, probably,
then numbered and branded—but we
d ° not know for certain. It is a re-
freshing thing to hear that many of
! he w,id , n . omads of > he i North are
Bei "« claimed rom freedom in this
fashion. A Cooktown paper says that,
.. Jt has been no uncommon thing, in
be p asb even for police officers to
supply to the order of friendly settlers
such black boys and girls as they
might requisition;” and that “men on
the road have even fought for the
possession of a boy or girl as if they
were common goods and chattels, and
the victor has walked away proudly
with his property.” And yet there are
people who say that Queenslanders set
no value on their black neighbors!

"It's really working for peace—sabotaging defence to ensure a short war."


PLAIN ENGLISH
A Pacific Grand Design
' ast April The Bulletin published
C Bernard Fall’s basic article on the
ir American options in South Viet-
nam —options which have not changed
significantly in the ensuing months.
Ijhey are: withdrawal; negotiation;
parrying the war to the North;
lr continuation of the war within its
resent limits. None seemed or seems
atisfactory. The first two mean
iving Indo-China and ultimately
lalaya to the Communists; the third
nay escalate into a world war; the
ourth appears to be a losing policy.
In the present ominous circum-
jltances in Indo-China it seems increa-
singly likely, however, that some com-
fcination of the third and fourth
options may be adopted; in other
!ords, an extension of the war by
niited bombing of Vietcong supply
:ntres outside South Vietnam, but in
i cautious way in order to avoid esca-
btion into a major war. This, it is
tlaimed plausibly, should both boost
fouth Vietnamese morale and force
Hanoi to stop sending men and
jnaterial supplies to the south. It
(would not be so much a new and
Tdangerous policy as an old and suc-
cessful one—as the experience in Laos
ishows. When the Communist Pathet
Lao shot down an American photo re-
connaissance plane in Laos earlier
-this year, the Americans seized the
1 opportunity to retaliate by limited
bombing and strafing of the Commu-
nist anti-aircraft battery. Since then
There has been no further interference
pith US reconnaissance planes. Fur-
ther, the Americans helped the Sou-
fanna Phouma build up his neutralist
air force of 20 planes which, flown by
Laotians, have bombed the Commu-
nists’ positions in Laos and forced
jiiem to retreat to the Plain of Jars,
laving succeeded in Laos it seems
fobable that a version of these tac-
tics will succeed in South Vietnam.
Yet, even if this were successful, it
pould not change the basic criticism of
American policy in Indo-China.
(tombing Vietcong bases, like the
jtambing of North Vietnam naval in-
stallations earlier this year, would be
Merely tactical and of short-term value.
After a short lull, the position could
ea sily deteriorate again as the Com-
munists renew their initiative. Tacti-
cal bombing may, in other words,
merely postpone disaster.
The fundamental problem is that
America has not shown the sort of
determination, or produced the sort
of Grand Design, to preserve free
Asia from Communism that it used
to preserve free Europe after World
War II when the conditions in Europe
were similar to those in Asia today.
America’s Asia policy, unlike its
European policy, has been a matter
of bits and pieces, the result of acci-
dents rather than planning. It got its
Japan policy because it won a war; a
Formosa policy because Free China
lost one; an Indo-China and an Indo-
nesia policy because France and Hol-
land withdrew from Asia; a Philip-
pines policy for another reason, and
Australia policy for still another
reason, and so on.
What all the free countries in this
region look to America for, but do
not yet get, is the sort of leadership
Europeans received after 1945 when
Russia seemed as likely to conquer
Europe as Red China now looks like
conquering Asia. In view of the great
cultural and economic differences be-
tween the various free countries in
what is called the containment arc
from Japan down through Indo-China
and the Maphilindo countries to Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, we cannot
expect to have a Pacific alliance like
the Atlantic alliance. But these coun-
tries, including Australia, can and do
look to America to encourage what-
ever economic, political, cultural and
military association between them is
possible in order to preserve their
freedom and contain Communism.
The real alternative to letting the Com-
munists chop these countries down one
by one is an American Grand Design
—economic as well as military.
In his first year as President, Mr
L. B. Johnson has shown far more
constructive interest in Asia than the
late President Kennedy showed. If he
goes on to put his stamp on the 1960 s
by developing a coherent US Pacific
policy, he will do more than save South
Vietnam, he may save all the free
countries in the Pacific.
Cleaning Up the Island
Tt required something unprecedented
A in Australian history—an alleged
act of sabotage designed to prevent an
Australian warship being repaired, but
the recent scandals at Garden Island
may at last have woken up the Federal
and Naval authorities to the need both
to “screen” all applicants for positions
in defence establishments and to have
Communists already working there
transferred to other jobs.
After past industrial troubles, vari-
ous legal and managerial arrangements
were made, and no doubt will be made
again, to limit their impact on defence
operations, but this is only tinkering
with the problem, which will remain as
long as we have the fantastic situation
of our warships being prepared for
service by Communists or their follow-
ers.
The astonishing thing is that for
years there has not been any policy
by the Federal Government, the
Department of the Navy or the Dep-
artment of Supply to screen out all
Communist applicants for work in all
defence establishments (not only in
Garden Island). A self-proclaimed
Communist will not be employed in
the Department of External Affairs,
but he has been able apparently to get
a job any time in a naval dockyard.
As The Bulletin has pointed out be-
fore, this is all the more ridiculous
since it would still be difficult for a
traitor to operate effectively in an
External Affairs post he would need
cameras, transmitters, skills, contacts
and so on whereas at Garden Island
he would only need the will to throw
a spanner in the works.
The Garden Island allegations may
have changed all that —although until
the lesson is learnt by the Department
of Supply as well as by the Department
of the Navy we cannot be completely
sure.


THIS AUSTRALIA:
ALP: For Old Men Only?
For Mr Calwell, it never happened
V. C. GAIR
J. P. ORMONDE
G. C. HANNAN
CANBERRA, SUNDAY The voters
w'ere apathetic; and after the Menzies
Government had clearly won Saturday’s
Senate election the Opposition leader Mr
A. Calwell said the Government had
not received a vote of confidence. Put
those things together, add the Robertson
House of Representatives by-election
where Labor, represented by an ALP
Right-winger, Mr Arthur Mollett, broke
the overall NSW pattern to make inroads
into the Liberal vote, and you have the
picture of the Senate election.
Mr Calwell’s pathetic comment sum-
marises Labor’s fundmental weakness
over recent years. Though he was look-
ing at figures that told their own story—
a story of yet another electoral win by
Prime Minister Menzies —he could not
face up to realities. He preferred not
to see them. The vote which the Govern-
ment with justification could claim as a
vote of confidence at least as clear as
that given by the 1963 House of Rep-
resentatives vote was waved aside by
Mr Calwell. It was not a vote of con-
fidence. It never happened.
Yet Labor, in my view, started off the
Senate campaign with every advantage.
As the vote was for the Senate alone,
the poll was the equivalent of a by-
election.
The Menzies Government had intro-
duced conscription for selected 20-year-
olds for overseas service. Labor could
rely upon the support of the older voters
—those who had gone through the 1917
and 1942 anti-conscription campaigns
and who would be reluctant to force
upon a younger generation a compulsion
which in 1917 they rejected and in
1942 had had limited in geographical
area.
It is impossible to dogmatise with any
real confidence on what the young voters
did, but my feeling—which gets some
confirmation from the figures in the fast-
growing outer suburbs of Sydney and
Melbourne where younger groups tend
to migrate from the inner city areas
is that this vote went largely to the
Government.
Even on the wider issue of defence
preparedness generally, Labor was in
quite an advantageous position. Sections
of Menzies’ recent defence statement —
its blueprint for Australia's arms build-up
-—have gaps in them through wLich you
could drive a bullock team and waggon,
never mind a Centurion tank.
On the mechanical side Labor got
further advantages. It was first on the
Senate Ballot paper in both NSW and
Victoria and hence the recipient of the
“donkey” vote from those who vote
straight across the paper.
NSW points up most clearly Labor’s
electoral plight, which is that the voters
are not prepared to accept Labor’s Left
wing, Mollett, an ALP Right-winger,
made respectable inroads into the Liber-
als’ majority in Robertson which could be
expected in a by-election. But the Senate
vote went the other way. The explanation
for this undoubtedly lies in the fact that
the No. 3 man in J. P. Ormonde’s team
was Mr Les Haylen, who describes him-
self as a Leftist and who, if returned,
would undoubtedly be another vote for
Victorian Dr Cairns.
This anti-Left wing suspicion mani-
fested itself in many ways on Saturday
night. Not only did the Government team
headed by Senate President, Sir Alister
McMullin, despite its inferior position
on the Senate ballot paper, outstrip the
ALP team in its own right on the vote,
but in Labor-held seat after Labor-held
seat including Barton, Macquarie, Eden-
Monaro and even Parkes (held by Mr
Haylen from 1943 to 1963) showed
majorities for the Government team.
Yet despite the bleak figures from
Labor’s viewpoint, in NSW Labor did I
much better than it did in Victoria.
In Victoria the ALP received only!
42.97 per cent of the total vote. Against*
that the non-Labor forces of Govern-I
ment and DLP combined had 55, 9jj
per cent with the Liberals contributing)
42.15 per cent and the DLP 13.83 per[
cent. Queensland was also behind NSVf
from the ALP viewpoint. The ALP teanfc
received 44.23 per cent of the vote com-'i
pared with a total of 54.12 per cent fori
the non-Labor forces. Of this 54.12 perl
cent, the Government team contributed!
44.37 per cent and Mr Vince Gair, a
former Queensland Labor Premier stand-
ing for the DLP, contributed 11.75 per
cent. Western Australia, another Left
wing Labor State, showed the same
depressing picture as far as Labor was
concerned. Labor’s share of the vote
there on Saturday night was 42.21 per,
cent and the Government was assured
of a win.
But in Western Australia, despitej
Labor’s defeat, the Left wing made an!
advance. Senator Joe Cooke, a Laborl
Right-winger who would have voted in'
a leadership ballot for Mr Whitlamt
against Dr Cairns, was pushed into No. 3)
position on the ALP ticket and will lose[
his seat. In his place in the No. 2’
position went Mr John Wheeldon, a|
protege of Mr F. E. Chamberlain, the,
Left-wing Secretary of the WA ALP,
Mr Wheeldon is a certain vote for Di
Cairns.
Only in South Australia, where the!
voters have consistently plumped fo]
Labor in Federal elections over recent
years while returning a non-Labor Stati
Government, and in Tasmania, did Laboi
have bright spots. South Australia con-
formed with its practice of recent times
and will return three Labor Senators. In
Tasmania ALP candidate Mr Robert
Lacey, Secretary of the Tasmanian
and a Right-winger, nosed out Senator
George Cole who has been the DLP's
solitary Parliamentary representative for
the past three years, for the fifth Senate
position in that State.
Boiled down, what seems to have)
emerged from Saturday’s poll is: (1) arQ
other electoral triumph for Sir Robertj
Menzies; (2) a further indication that
the Labor Party is increasingly losing
touch with the younger generation of
voters yearly growing more numerous; i
and (3) yet a further illustration of the]
fact that while Labor Federally insists a
upon continuing its Leftist drift the <
electorate generally will persist in not
regarding it as an alternative Government
to the Menzies administration.

What Is Australia?
(SYDNEY A Sydney solicitor, Mr
IC e Miles, has involved himself in a
ial controversy as to whether Australia
[one of Her Majesty’s dominions or a
jitish possession, and has asked the
Immonwealth Attorney - General, Mr
M. Snedden, to approach the United
ations General Assembly for an ad-
sory opinion from the International
ourt of Justice. Last week in the Special
: deral Court Mr C. S. Rodgers, SM,
dered that Abraham Israel Sampson,
I whom Mr Miles was appearing, be
iradited to Hong Kong under the Fugi-
es Offenders Act (passed by the British
rliament which states that any fugitive

fence in one part of Her Majesty’s
minions may be extradited from an-
ler part of Her Majesty’s dominions

allied for Sampson’s extradition to face
fraud charges which allegedly took

-Mr Miles challenged the validity of

ilian and subsequently contested any
BRUCE MILES
:ht a court in Hong Kong sought to
lercise over him. Mr Miles also chai-
ned the applicability of the Act in
'jastralia because “that Act is not an
ft of the Australian Commonwealth —
lis the Act of Britain and another
tatury. When the British Parliament
ped this Act there was no question of
fat a dominion was —Britain dominated
| whole of the British Empire, which
Eluded Hong Kong and Australia,
wwever, Australia is now not domi-
ped by Britain in any shape or form
I'd thus is not a dominion nor is Hong
long.”
“Because a man’s liberty is in jeopardy
Court must decide what Australia’s
n »tus is in relation to Britain and the
J °rld. Before this man is ordered back
to Hong Kong the Court must determine
the meaning of British possession. I say
the meaning given to the Act in 1881 is
not necessarily the meaning given to it
now,” Mr Miles said.
Mr Rodgers in giving his decision said
he did not propose to decide categorically
all matters raised by Mr Miles. It was of
course a fact, he said, that this particular
Act had been recognised by superior
courts as being valid. “I hold that the
offences with which Sampson is charged
are ones to which the Fugitives Offenders
Act does apply,” Mr Rodgers said.
Meanwhile Sampson is being held at
Long Bay Gaol for a period of 15 days.
At the time of going to Press Sampson
had lodged a writ of habeus corpus
with the Supreme Court and Mr Miles
had not received any reply from the
Attorney-General.
LAW-II
“Lost Soul”
HOBART —Mr Justice Neasey in
the Hobart Supreme Court last week
reserved decision in a libel action in-
volving a claim by an Australian author,
Mr Hal Porter, against the Mercury
Newspaper Pty Ltd, for unspecified
damages. The action arose from the
publication of a review of an auto-
biography written by Porter, “The
Watcher on the Cast Iron Balcony”
(which portrays the life of the author
from 1911 to 1929), in which he claims
the newspaper falsely and maliciously
printed and published words that had
seriously injured his character, credit and
reputation, and had brought him into
public scandal, odium and contempt.
The “Mercury” claims that the words did
not bear the meanings alleged, that they
were fair comment and were published
in good faith.
(The words complained of in the
review, written by Mr Ronald Broinow-
ski, were: “When I read Mr Porter’s
boast some time ago that he believed this
essay of his autobiography would be
banned, I naturally became suspicious.
Everyone knows that to have a book
banned is a wonderful selling point: to
anticipate it is sheer optimism and, of
course, a free advertisement if you can
get your opinion published. And Mr
Porter failed in the former and achieved
the latter, but I doubt that it will raise
‘The Watcher on the Cast Iron Balcony’
from the obscurity which should be its
natural fate.
“The reader will find in it those Anglo-
Saxon words on which Mr Porter bases
his hopes of being banned. They are the
same old words inserted in the same
laborious way. The book gains nothing
from them, not even notoriety. In style
it creates the impression of being written
by candlelight with a multitude of
flickering shadows, presumably to make
the wailings of a lost soul more im-
pressive. One hopes for his own sake
that Mr Porter’s life has been more full
than he would leave us to believe.”)
Appearing for Porter, Mr T. E. F.
Hughes, QC, of Sydney, said the action
had arisen from the review which went
beyond the book itself. The review’s
criticism contained serious defamatory
allegations and imputed that Porter Was
guilty of a form of literary dishonesty
by inserting certain four-letter Anglo-
Saxon words with the intention of
attracting the censor’s attention. The
criticisms had not been fair comment
because the words contained implications
and something else which might occur
to the reader beyond their ordinary
meaning.
Ronald Broinowski, who wrote the
review and is a leader writer for the
“Mercury”, admitted during cross-
examination that he could not swear
having read every word in the book
before writing his review; nor could he
swear that he had read every page
thoroughly. He admitted that he had
written the review on a residual recol-

jection of newspaper articles and the
book.
Asked what he meant by the term
“lost soul"’ used in his review (Mr
Hughes suggested the term passed an
immoral judgment on the author as a
man), Broinowski replied that his defini-
tion of “lost soul” was an unhappy man
and he would not use the expression in
the sense of describing a man who had
lost hope of salvation. His impression
of the book was that Porter’s life had
not been happy. So far as the review
was concerned he believed it to be fair.

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
An opportunity presents itself for a private investor or Motel Company to invest in the building
of a First Class Motel in ALICE SPRINGS. A large property in the town, with a frontage to the
Main Stuart Highway of 330 feet by depth of 660 feet, is offered for this purpose.
The property is held as a Motel site and all covenants required by the Commonwealth Government
Administration have been met.
Tentative plans have been drawn by Adelaide Architect Brian Vogt for a 24 double suite unit but
can be extended up to 75 or more if necessary. A liquor licence can be obtained.
The owners do not require any cash consideration but require share interests with the right to
manage. They are well and favorably known throughout the Centre and are experienced in
this type of business
A very real potential exists in the rapidly expanding town of ALICE SPRiNGS, population of
approximately 5500, both in Tourism and local travellers. Modern, first class accommodation to
cater for the rapidly increasing tourist trade is badly needed and here the opportunity exists to
supply the need. The site is regarded as one of the best in the Northern Territory.

scenity. First was /he “Tharunka” case,
won on appeal (s,ee The Bulletin, Nov.
14); then the “-'Pleasure” magazine case
(see The Bulletin, Nov. 21); and last
week in Central Court Mr F. Pocock,
SM, dismissed information against Gor-
don anff Gotch (Australia) Ftd, for dis-
tributing a photographic magazine
“Figure” which the Chief Secretary's
Department considered may be obscene.
The worst thing Mr Pocock had to
say about “Figure” was that the cover
photograph was “cheese-cake” though
this was not representative of the other
nudes in the magazine. He felt the maga-
zine was serious in its approach to
photography and was aimed to appeal
to people interested in this form of art.
The nudes, he said (some of which Mr
Pocock described as classical) were not
posed in an indelicate or provocative
manner.
Dismissing the charge, Mr Pocock re-
jected submissions by Mr Kenneth Gee
(for the Chief Secretary's Department)
that 5500 copies of “Figure” would “seep
through the community” reaching people
of all ages and mental groups. Mr Gee
said that serious readers would look at
the magazine's nudes in a detached way,
considering “such abstract questions as
the beauty of the plastic form. Others
would be looking at it purely for the
purpose of erotic stimulation,” he said.
“The community still regards that as
offensive to its standards.”

Adelaide Orthodox leaders say M
trouble stems from the early Greek

in which they built the churches and pai
the priests. This differed from the
in Greece, and although it worked we//
for many years, laymen gradually sougf
more control over priests.
The rift among the Greek communitiP
in Australia continues, and in Adelaide

POLITICS
Vote Racket
PERTH Senile people incapable of
casting an intelligent vote are being
used up by over-zealous party members,
according to West Australian MLA Mr
Mervin Toms. He put up a Bill to
eliminate abuses of postal voting pro-
cedures; though he admitted his own
ALP canvassers could be as much at
fault as others, the Bill was defeated
at its second reading during the last
hours of the session strictly on party
lines. Mr Toms claims that votes, which
could run into hundreds and could well
swing a close election, can be and have
been manipulated through C-class hos-
pitals, convalescent homes, and rest
homes which house the very old. These
institutions do not come within the
existing Act, which allows Electoral
Department officers to visit, accept the
votes of those they consider capable of
voting, and to list those incapable of
registering a rational vote.
Mr Toms said that the matron of one
such hospital, where he found a heap
of signed postal votes, had told him:
“More than half these people wouldn’t
know how to scratch themselves.” He
asked the House: “How did these people
come to make an application? Were they
assisted? If so, by whom? Who was
going to assist in the completion of the
papers?” Later Mr Toms stressed that he
did not suspect a vote racket, but he felt
the loopholes left too much room for
further abuses.

THE NORTH
Pilot Farmers
MELBOURNE Research has
shown that pasture improvement of the
Katherine-Daly Rivers basin in the
Northern Territory could multiply its
present carrying capacity tenfold in the
wet season, and double the weight gain
per head at the same time. The basin
encloses about 4i million acres of land
from which the present cattle take-off
is about 800 head a year. However, the
commercial feasibility of such a scheme
has never been measured.
Two weeks ago the Victorian Em-
ployers’ Federation and the Constitu-
tional Club announced that they soon
hope to undertake such a plan. They
have formed a non-profit company called
the North Australian Foundation.
Around £250,000 is needed. Mr A. R.
Driver, the executive director and a
former administrator of the Territory,
openly admits that this is risk capital.
The only way to raise it is by donations
which will be tax-deductible, due to their
sinking into a non-profit organisation
and an approved research institute. Un-
fortunately, the Foundation has yet to
be accepted as belonging to the latter
class. Acceptance depends on the out-
come of an application made to the
Taxation Department. A decision is ex-
pected in December. If it is unfavorable
then the whole scheme will probably fail.
An agricultural development lease of
100,000 acres has been requested. Ini-
tially, one or possibly two farms are to be
established in different areas, then more
will follow. Each farm will employ
about ten people, one of whom will be
a young “pioneer” type who will eventu-
ally take over the farm, once profits are
shown. Proceeds from the sale will be
used by the Foundation for further de-
velopment. As a sideline, it is hoped to
test capabilities of the local Aborigines
as modern agricultural workers and to
establish the farms as a type of training
centre.
TRANSPORT
No Pep Pills
MELBOURNE The interstate
truck driver faces new restrictions under
legislation introduced by the Minister
for Transport, Mr Meagher, designed
to check the abuses of driving for long
hours without rest, excessive speed, and
the taking of “pep pills”. The legisla-
tion follows reports of owner-drivers of
small trucks operating a “taxi-service”
between Melbourne and Sydney along the
Hume Highway. New South Wales has
approved similar legislation and both
States will proclaim it soon on the same
date.
Speeds of 70 m.p.h. were not unusual,
with reports of firms offering bonuses
for drivers arriving ahead of time. One
spokesman for the Transport Workers’
Union claimed “pep pills” were being
given out with pay packets.
While the legislation makes no men-
tion of “pep pills” it will give police and
transport inspectors wider powers to
check on this and other abuses. In par-
ticular the legislation means that every
driver will have to keep an authoris
log book which will make it much hart
to fake the entries. In Victoria, \
Railways, both management and unJ
have been strongly critical of road hail
ers who represent strong competition a

Mr Mortimer on the other hand “ex-
s essed his regret that the Australian
( jnimunist Party on the surface was not
bore active in taking initiatives on the
Testion of anti-Semitism in Russia and
Tded “the Australian Communist Party
L s unfortunately not always as quick off
|e mark in such matters as it should be”.
, ( [r Mortimer went further: he empha-
,ed that the Australian Party had pre-
ilously maintained that constructive
riticism of the negative features of
oviet life assist rather than harm the
auses of peace and socialism. The ques-
]Ln of Soviet Jewry fell into this eate-
ry. And in offering to accept an article
|i “The Plight of Soviet Jewry” for
ctiblication in the Marxist quarterly
liurnal “Arena” which he co-edits (to be
flatten by Mr Isi Leibler, the public
Mahons chairman of the Victorian Jew-
-4 board of deputies) Mr Mortimer
his probably gone further than any other
4ding Communist anywhere in the
'Vld. Just how far he has gone in Aus-
i|alia may be understood if previous
Communist positions on the subject are
Lamined.
| As recently as last year leading Com-
■unist writer Judah Waten was vehem-
|tly insisting in The Bulletin that
jnti-Semitic publications and cartoons
slluch Jewish bodies claimed were circu-
iting in the Soviet Union were “forg-
oes”. Mr Leibler was described as “a
Slight of the cold war” in “The Guard-
in’’ amongst other abuse, and the end-
ps statistics of how many Jewish
journalists and doctors there were in the
lipviet Union were features of numerous
ahials in articles showing how well off
Soviet Jewry really was.
P The most recent jolts to this predict-
able party line have been the circulation
if the obscene anti-Semitic Kichko car-
oons both in Australia and abroad where
iuropean Communist Parties, especially
!te French and Italian ones, have pro-
sled strongly, the long-delayed catching
p by local Communist intellectuals with
j 3
surveys and evidence from overseas, and
the growing protests among Liberal and
Socialist groups locally such as the publi-
cation of the recent dissent pamphlet on
Soviet Jewry.
The Italian Communist Party in par-
ticular has shown its strong desire for
independence, its drive for greater liberal-
isation in the Soviet Union and Soviet
bloc countries. The late Party leader Tog-
liatti’s criticisms of the excesses of Soviet
leadership, his explanation of these ex-
cesses in terms of “systemic” causes
rather than aberrations of individual per-
sonality, and the broad based mass mem-
bership of the Italian Party which in-
cludes many intellectuals have contri-
buted to this tradition of greater freedom
of expression.
For intellectuals like Rex Mortimer the
Italian style has many attractions. But
it also has its problems in Australia. Un-
like the Italian Party the Australian
Party does not have mass support. If any-
thing it is top heavy with trade union
officials. And yet there would be a way
of extending the support for the Com-
munist Party if it could remodel itself
to be less cut off from the Labor Party
and other potential sources of Left-wing
alignment within the greater Labor move-
ment. To do this, Mr Mortimer realises
that he must de-dogmatise the Party in
many respects, that the Party must be-
come less rigid, that orthodox conserva-
tive policies will have to be reconsidered.
Earlier this year, Dr lan Turner, a
Left-wing intellectual who is no longer a
member of the Party, suggested that an
Italian-style wing was already in opera-
tion. There have been other indications.
The setting up of “Arena”, a quarterly
published in Melbourne, is an important
example. Unlike its other publications
the Communist Party does not want it
generally known that it finances “Arena”
which it prefers to be known as a
“Marxist” quarterly. “Arena” publishes
articles by non-Communists which some-
times are even critical of the Soviet
Union or Communist Party policy. It is
an important weapon in the strategy to
capture the progressive intellectuals.
But Mr Mortimer’s desire for an anti-
podean apertura a sinistra is no guaran-
tee that the conservative forces within
the Communist Party will sit back and
give him a free hand. The Taft state-
ment on the Soviet Jewry question makes
it clear that the Signore Mortimer line
will have a hard and probably unsuccess-
ful time ahead. It will be coming up
against the orthodox trade union leaders
who are immediately suspicious of any
sophisticated intellectual attempts at re-
vision along Italian lines. In the mean-
time, while the struggle goes on there will
be some wooing of the uncommitted non-
Communist intellectuals, academics and
writers especially.

CIVIL RIGHTS
Are Soldiers Citizens?
By a Defence Correspondent
Every young officer or officer cadet
in the three Services learns the pro-
cedure for what is somewhat euphe-
mistically called “redress of wrongs”. It
is a process of complaint through suc-
cessive levels of authority with the pos-
sibility of redress but also of penalty. It is
not irrelevant that the first officer to hear
the complaint may well be the subject of
it. Officers can refer their grievances up
as far as the Governor-General, while
other ranks can appeal to the respective
Service Board. The system works about
as well as can be expected of it. It is
virtually the only legal channel of griev-
ance adjustment. Yet frequently the griev-
ance may be of a kind (e.g. rates of pay)
which, however favorable the successive
authorities may be, cannot possibly be
adjusted by this process.
There are several other media, of vary-
ing legality and value. Recently, two offi-
cers, one in the Army and one in the
Navy, who were prevented from resign-
ing their commissions, went to the High
Court, backed by a fund to which many
other officers contributed. The officers
lost their cases. It could be that they did
not expect to win, but hoped that the
publicity obtained would force a relaxa-
tion of the regulations. As it turned out,
the results have been quite the opposite,
and recent legislation has tightened the
provisions on resignations to the point
where it is clearly useless to go to the
High Court.
Courts of law have never been a regu-
lar means for redressing Service griev-
ances, and seldom satisfactory. Large
areas of military administration are
deliberately excluded from court jurisdic-
tion. A serviceman cannot sue for his
pay while he is serving, for example.
He has no contract of employment which
is enforceable at law. He can be dismissed
at will, but he cannot resign at will. He
has no say in his conditions of service,
which can be changed without reference
to him as is currently happening over
the right of RAAF officers to resign their
commissions in peacetime.
The other two means of airing com-
plaints, in the hope of bringing direct or
indirect pressure on the authorities to
effect redress, are letters to the Press
and communications to Members of
Parliament. The first is generally regarded
as illegal, but is widely practised, usually
by giving a nom-de-plume or having the
letter signed by the complainant’s wife.
Much of the dissatisfaction with condi-
tions of service and the Defence Forces
Retirement Benefit scheme has been
voiced in this way, but its effect is prob-
lematical. Neither Cabinet Ministers
senior Service officers, nor civilian offi-
cials are noted for acting upon incidental
letters to the editor, signed or unsigned;
and editors rarely see profit in prolonging
a correspondence campaign for the length
of time needed to make a firm impres-
sion on public opinion or the Govern-
ment.
Direct complaints to Members of
Parliament are a little more likely to have
an effect. Some of the more offensive
provisions of the DFRB scheme have
been aired by those means, and official
action has been promised.
Whether an Australian serviceman has
the legal right to approach his Member
is obscure. In the United Kingdom and
the United States he is entitled to do so.
Here, the approach is customarily made
by or in the name of the serviceman's
wife, who is not subject to military dis-
cipline. Of course not all servicemen have
a wife.
It is unlikely that there will ever be
a time when there will not be dissatis-
faction within the Services, whether well-
founded or not. At present, housing,
transfer policy, resignations, and pensions
are subjects of complaint. It is time
that the processes of airing and adjusting
grievances were reviewed, extended and
formalised. This can be done without
pandering to the paranoic or the pro-
fessional grumbler.
The United States and New Zealand
have instituted procedures which recog-
nise the need for an independent review
of grievances and the inability of MPs to
act as satisfactory ombudsmen. Each of
the American Service departments has a
Board for the Correction of Military
Records. These boards act as admini-
strative courts, and have wide powers to
redress grievances by adjusting military
records. They may appear to be open to
political or other pressure, but the idea is
worth examining. In New Zealand, the
ombudsman, the independent Parlia-
mentary Commissioner with extensive
power to investigate grievances, can look
into certain Service complaints, but not
those relating to conditions of service
and discipline. Perhaps we need an
ombudsman for our Services.
The Government appears to have
given little thought to this subject. It
would seem to assume that first-class
servicemen are not entitled to be more
than second-class citizens, without reali-
sing that a man is more likely to be a
first-class serviceman if he is also treated
as a first-class citizen.


Inside the Poker Machine World
THAT £30 million Jackpot
By HUGH CURNOW
44 £-'1 ydney,” the Australian Hotels
Association’s spokesman, told us
sternly, “is getting more like Las
Vegas every year.” He was referring, of
course, to the 1340 poker-machine clubs
now operating between the Queensland
and Victoria borders in this country.
“The only other area of the world that
we know of where a similar disastrous
state of affairs exists is Nevada.” He
went on to give ancient Rome as another
example of the dangers of club life,
pointing out that the Greco-Roman
empires were riddled with all sorts of
clubs before they declined and fell into
oblivion. “Just the same sort of clubs
as operate today, basically. Members
banded together, paid annual subs, drew
up their own rules, arranged to bury their
deceased friends, all that. It’s really
quite a warning to anyone who goes into
this club story thoroughly.”
Already, we knew, the NSW Methodist
Church had decided to campaign for the
abolition of poker machines. The chair-
man of the Goulburn Synod, the Rev.
N. W. Lickiss, had stated a year ago that
NSW finances were “dislocated” because
poker machines had “got out of hand”.
Most NSW politicians, however, will not
come out against the machines or risk
making an election issue of them. Clearly
it was necessary to undertake a club-
crawl, on your behalf, to see what is
going on inside these Dens of Dishonesty
or Homes Away From Home (depending
on your point of view). There are some
1000 clubs licensed to operate poker
machines in the Sydney metropolitan
area. We started with five of them. As
it was a sweltering hot night at the St
George Club Pty Ltd, in Hurstville, all
the men had removed their jackets. Some
200 of them were seated at dinner tables
when we arrived. They were watching
Leilani, a Tahitian travel poster girl who
was halfway through her fire dance,
shaking and sweating all over. Leilani
was one of three acts arranged to enter-
tain Hurstville businessmen at this, their
monthly stag dinner. At least a dozen
shirt-sleeved members, however, thought
the main attraction of the evening was
still at the opposite end of the long room.
They were standing down there with
their backs to the hula-clad entertainer,
their attention riveted on the tumbling
aces, kings, queens and jacks of the
club’s brightly-lit poker machines. Twelve
out of 200. Only the palest shades of
Las Vegas there.
ITowever, in the plush upstairs lounge
beyond the white marble foyer of the
more famous St George Leagues Club,
at nearby Carlton, the Midas touch of
Old Nevada began to glitter through.
Jacketed men and fully-clothed women
were foregathering in air-conditioned
coolness for cocktails before dinner in
the candle-lit restaurant. One woman,
fashionably - dressed and waiting for
her husband, perched patiently on a
stool conveniently placed in front of a
nearby poker machine and unfastened
her gold-sequinned evening bag. It con-
tained lipstick, a pressed-powder
pact, a phial of scent, a lace-edged hand-
kerchief and a fiver’s-worth of florins.
Methodically she began feeding her first
fistful of coins into the shoulder-height,
two-shilling slot, pausing only to pat her
perm back into place. (It became slightly
dislodged after one particularly energetic
jerk she gave the machine’s lever when
it momentarily jammed.)
Over at the Campsie RSL Club the
electric clock on the wall of the rear
bar indicated the hour of nine. Abruptly
lights dimmed and a 240-volt “sun”
began to rise and set behind a glass
plaque illuminated with war-cemetery
graves. Members and poker-machines
alike fell silent during this brief “remem-
brance” display. There was a time and
a place for everything at that club, an
official told us. “It would be very bad
form for a member to play a machine
while the ‘sun’ was up,” he said.
Both the downstairs and upstairs bars
at the South Sydney Leagues Club have
black and white floor-coverings, defining
areas reserved for men only. Both bars,
we couldn’t help notice, give a com-
manding view of adjacent rows of poker
machines. Male members can ensure at
a glance that no one touches machines
they may reserve while having a drink
and also keep an eye on how their wives
are faring with the housekeeping. The
atmosphere seemed more domestic and
down-right friendly than dazzling.
On Sunday afternoon we went to the
Randwick Rugby (Union) Club. Six skin-
divers from the Coogee rock pool were
beginning their regular weekly session
seated in comfortable chairs in the down-
stairs lounge, all wearing open-necked
shirts, beach shorts and thongs. A white-

fPHE Australian Hotels Association, of
A course, calls it something entirely
different: the Sound of Economic Ruin.
The economics of the poker-machine
world are a hotly-discussed issue with
some £3O million direct revenue now
being distributed annually among the
clubs after payment of poker-machine
taxes and prizes. Not all of the clubs’
profits come from poker machines, how-
ever. The most recent Commonwealth
Census shows that during 1961-62 in
NSW the clubs sold retail goods worth
more than £24 million.
(Members and their guests spent £2l
million on bottle-department sales of
beer, wine and spirits, £2 million on
tobacco, cigars and cigarettes, £378,000
on confectionery and £lOB,OOO on other
goods).
Figures like those make the AHA
blanch on behalf of retail stores through-
out the State. But there are many other
people, besides club members, who wel-
come the clubs’ booming prosperity. As
well as the thousands of employees
engaged in the poker-machine world
(South Sydney Leagues Club has 160 on
its payroll now), nearly 1000 entertainers
are maintained in more or less full-time
jobs by the clubs in Sydney alone. Eliza-
bethan Trust Opera singers, like Althea
Bridges and Raymond Macdonald, rub
shoulders with Johnny Lockwood,
Johnny O’Connor, Valmai Johnson and
Donald Cameron on the clubs circuit.
Agents like Sid Ross, Keith Crocket,
Brian Fehon and “Tivoli Bill” Sadler,
have hundreds of acts on their books, all
of whom can appear at two clubs a week
for a year and not be seen twice in the
same place. Mr Jim (“Scott”) Stirling, the
pianist, organises shows for some of
the larger clubs, “Sydney is now the only
city in the world where so many enter-
tainers can earn a decent living without
having to go on tour. They live right
here, some of them at Rose Bay and
Vaucluse, with their families, furniture

tween £lO and £lOO for a night’s work,”
he says.
Husband - and - wife team, Vera and
Tony Marshall, told us that doing their
song - and - dance act on Thursdays,
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays is paying
for their four children’s education. “We
don’t know what we’d do if the clubs
didn’t spend so much on entertainment,”
said Vera. (At the “Taj Mahal” —St
George Leagues Club the weekly en-
tertainment budget tops £1000.)
What the clubs spend on amenities for
their members is a sort of running joke
in Sydney. “What are you doing to-
night?” a member of the South Sydney
Junior Leagues Club asked his friend
recently. “I’m going to George’s River,”
he said. “What! Don’t tell me he’s bought
a ruddy river now!” was the startled
reply. Everyone in Sydney would
appreciate the member’s mistake. Mr
George Wintle, secretary-manager of the
club, and his seemingly-endless pro-
gramme of purchases for club members,
are as familiar as “Hello, Dolly” in
NSW. Holiday homes on the Hawkes-
bury, fishing boats, tennis courts, bowling
greens, steam baths, speedboats and
squash courts have already been acquired.
The AHA v. the RCA
T ittle things aren’t overlooked, either.
Mr Wintle says his club spends £7O
a month on real flowers to decorate the
clubhouse premises in Anzac Parade.
(“I hate those plastic things.”) Then
there’s the club’s art class, run by Mrs
Barbara Duggan, president of the Banks-
town Art Society. Some 15 members
have produced 50 paintings soon to be
exhibited. The club library has 14,000
books. There is a French language class
twice a week. You name it, they’ve got
it or Mr Wintle will get it. There are
plenty of plans underway to spend last
year’s profit of £281,000 on behalf of
the club’s 13,000 members. Mr Wintle
recently inspected a 60ft luxury cabin
cruiser. “We thought of buying a couple
of racehorses but plan to lease them
instead,” he said. “Buying horses is a
bit of a gamble.”
Obviously, all clubs, being essentially
co-operatives, plough back their profits.
That is not the main theme of the AHA’s
objections to them, however. Armed with
detailed statements from the AHA presi-
dent in Sydney, Mr Barry Mclnerny, and
other association spokesmen, we spoke
with the president of the Registered
Clubs of NSW, Mr Bill Buckley, in the
downstairs bar of the State’s largest
(21,000 members) club, the NSW
Leagues Club, in Elizabeth Street.
Q. The AHA says the clubs are doing
even the funeral parlors out of business.

financial members who die during the
year. What’s wrong with that?
Q. The AHA says the film industry
has been hard hit by the clubs showing
Cinema Scope movies free on Sunday
nights.
BUCKLEY: They’re not free. Mem-
bers have to pay their annual two
guineas club subscription. The movies
are included in that. If the film industry
is so upset they don’t have to supply us
with the movies.
Q. The AHA says that the use of
poker machines, quite apart from the
credit squeeze, has detrimentally affected
retail sales in NSW.
BUCKLEY: No, no, no! You don’t
have to look any further than the
shift of population trends and other
geographical problems to explain any
slump in retail profits. If the poker
machines are to blame how do you ex-
plain that most of the stores worst hit
have been at the Haymarket area? Any-
way, I’m told that this has been a
bumper year for retailing.
Q. The AHA says the clubs have an
unfair advantage over hotels because
they don’t have to pay tax on their net
profits.
BUCKLEY: I bet they say that! But
why should we pay company tax? Our
profits are not distributed to shareholders
or individuals like the hotels’ are. What
they’re really upset about is that the in-
creased competition of the clubs has
forced them to spend more money on
their own amenities.
Q. They object strongly to your pro-
posed 2\ per cent levy on clubs to
finance a publicity campaign.
BUCKLEY: Do they, indeed? Look,
they spend enough pushing out their own
propaganda, why shouldn’t we? We want
the public to know that we don’t exploit
people who use poker machines. I
personally advise any young man I see
throwing his money away on them to lay
off for a while. In this bar, for example,
there are no machines. They are up-
stairs. Yes, there is also a bar up there
but we at least have one bar without any
machines near it. People don’t know
things like that. And we give hundreds
of thousands of pounds to charity from
our registered clubs each year, don’t
forget. All you ever seem to hear are
the bad things about poker machines.
We’re paying to present the public with
the good side of the story, too.
Q. Actually, the AHA says the
machines don’t pay the regulation 90-odd
per cent at all.
BUCKLEY. Oh, yes they do! Of
course if you keep putting back your
winnings then the percentage you can
finally be paid in winnings must decrease.
But that also applies to the racecourse
tote, doesn’t it?
Q. The AHA says the clubs have
done deals with manufacturers so they
can offer members discounts on retail
goods.
BUCKLEY. Untrue! The club maga-
zines do carry advertisements listing dis-
counts available on everything from ash
trays to Christmas trees at certain dis-
count houses, but any member of the
public may obtain exactly the same dis-
counts there. These are only advertise-
ments which we present to our members
as a regular service.
Q. Mr Mclnerny says the policy of
the AHA has always been one of
opposition to poker machines.
BUCKLEY. The AHA hasn’t much
choice. They’re not allowed to have
poker machines in hotels. If they were,
you wouldn’t hear them complaining.
Mr Frank Stevens, MA, Executive
Director of the Registered Clubs As-
sociation, showed us a pamphlet his
association has produced, hitting back
at the AHA. He pointed out Item Seven
which quoted the AHA President’s news-
letter as saying that “Golf clubs’ trading
hours should be restricted to between
4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays and
10 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. Saturdays”. He
also said that the AHA Traders is a
discount house “primarily for hotel
keepers”. Thumbing through anti-AHA
and pro-clubs material he told us that
his association is “fully prepared” for a
fight with the AHA. “They seem to for-
get that hotels did have poker machines
in Sydney in the 1930 s until the law was
changed,” he added.
One club that the AHA may not object
to quite as much, perhaps, is at Rand-
wick. It has not got a hotel-rivalling bar
trade because it has no liquor licence. No,
all the Randwick Catholic Club has is
poker machines.

Meale: “The Moment
is Now”
Australian music moves into the international field
By RUSSELL HALEY
When I left England for Australia
in 1961 the names of Sidney
Nolan and Patrick White were
familiar. Australia had made its mark in
painting and literature. But as for music,
we knew only of various performers, a
few expatriate composers, but none
uniquely associated with Australia.
With the recent announcement of the
contract signed by Richard Meale with
the long-established publishing firm of
Boosey and Hawkes, Australia will take
its place in the international musical
scene. Boosey and Hawkes have com-
posers such as Stravinsky, Bela Bartok
and Benjamin Britten under contract.
It is a matter of surprise as well as
importance that the same type of con-
tract has been issued to a resident Aus-
tralian, Richard Meale. This particular
type of contract, only associated with
mature musical figures, has been given
to a composer virtually unknown outside
his own country, and to only a specialised
minority in it.
This type of contract means more
than the publication of compositions. As
with Stravinsky, Boosey and Hawkes’
aim will be to establish him not only as
published composer but as a distinctive
musical identity in the world. This will
be done by means of lecture tours, guest
appearances, conducting of his own
works and radio and television appearan-
ces. The normal terms, of course, include
the guarantee of the publication of at
least one major work per year (sympho-
nies, operas, ballets, etc.) as well as
undertaking promotion on an interna-
tional scale with premiere performances
under world-famous conductors and
orchestras and first-rate recordings.
Now that Australia is confronted with
a new international artistic figure, how
many of us know anything about him?
Richard Meale’s meticulous dress
belies the intense and passionate violence
of his music. His speech, which is precise
and at times coldly analytic, adds another
contrast to his aristic sensuality. To most
people he appears polite, considerate yet
reserved. His acceptance of social con-
formity is hard to align with his startling
and uncompromisingly original concepts
of musical form. It is as though two
conflicting allegiances are delicately main-
tained within the one person a
genuine compassion for society and an
intractable exploitation of his own in-
dividuality.
Yet to his few close friends almost the
opposite characteristics are revealed. It
is as though a sudden reversal of his
world takes place within this intimacy.
The outside world almost becomes an
enemy, the meticulous dress becoming an
armor against others, and his artistic
passion is revealed as a real human
passion. To his close friends he bypasses
politeness in a quest for unsparing revela-
tion. To those who know him, he does
exhibit some rather odd attitudes for a
composer (he often wants to go to Luna
Park or to horror films). Yet between
these apparent contradictions one factor
remains constant his refusal to make
any compromise in his musical expres-
sion.
Perhaps it is possible to relate his
uncompromising attitude to his first ex-
periences in music. For a start, he taught
himself to play the piano at the age of
eight and within a couple of years began
composing, again without tuition. He
never had traditional study under a teach-
er in composition. His individual mental-
ity showed itself before he attended the
Sydney Conservatorium when he wrote
a piano piece so experimental, that for
fear of being thought mad, he destroyed
the work by tearing it up and throwing
it down the lavatory.
This fear of his own creative processes
was maintained for a number of years
until he showed one of his works to his
piano teacher, Winifred Burston, who
persuaded him to seek Sir Eugene Goos-
sens’ opinion. Goossens expressed con-
siderable interest and advised Richard
Meale not to be concerned about the
unorthodox nature of his work. “Aus-
tralia needs music like this,” Goossens
told him. “You must continue.”
"EpROM this point on, Richard Meale
proceeded to go his own way, study-
ing by himself the scores of contempor-
ary masters such as Stravinsky and Bar-
tok, without ever seeking help from the
“hidebound” but preferring to go to the
“horse’s mouth” the music itself.
Because of financial difficulties Meale
was forced to leave the Conservatorium
during his Diploma Course in piano and
took a job as a record salesman. This
experience in the commercial world of
records, instead of being taken as a
martyrdom, was enjoyed wholeheartedly.
Through this experience he got to know
aspects of music that the cloistered life
of the Conservatorium had denied him.
For instance, instead of being revolted
by close contact with rock ’n’ roll, he
developed a discriminating ear for it.
This gave him his first idea that music
is not super-human but is an activity of
humans, and consequently, its terms only
exist in relation to a society and not to
any absolute values. This concept was
to be intensified five years later by an in-
timate study of Oriental nmsic.
During his period as a record sales-

man Meale experienced a critical three
years of virtual creative silence. In a
sudden rebellion against the silence
Meale wrote his “Sonata for Flute and
Piano” —in only two weeks. In this he
cast aside all conventionalities (even
modern) and discovered in this work an
unexpected rejuvenation of his creative
spirit. For the first time he found a
total freedom in writing.
It was this work (the only British com-
position chosen for performance at the
1963 Festival of the International Society
for Contemporary Music held in Amster-
dam) that helped Meale receive a grant
from the Ford Foundation in 1960. This
took him to the United States for six
months, in which he was free to pursue
any musical activity he wished. As well
as meeting young composers, Meale
chose to do research in non-Western
music at the University of California.
“We con live only with ‘now’”
TTnder the terms of the grant Meale
was given a “round the world” air-
ticket which led him to Spain. In Spain
this time, shock was experienced on a
human level as had been previously
experienced musically. In this light it
becomes clear why he so frequently
chooses Spanish references in the titles
of his works. He never actually uses
Spanish musical idioms but pays tribute
to the country in titles.
Since his return to Australia at the
end of 1961, Meale has been employed
as an officer of the ABC in the Music
Department. With great intensity he has
devoted himself to a full musical life.
Particularly he has propagated awareness
of the importance of avant garde music
by means of lectures, performances,
radio talks and his vital participation as
a member of the Sydney branch of the
ISCM. Besides giving piano perform-
ances of works unheard in Sydney, he
appeared at this year’s Adelaide Festival
of Arts both as performer and contribu-
tor to seminars held on contemporary
music. During a seminar in Music Edu-
cation at the University of Sydney he
contributed a most important and con-
troversial lecture on a new theory of
Music Education in schools, the revolu-
tionary nature of which created con-
siderable interest.
In a series of lectures at the Conserva-
torium early this year, Richard Meale's
musical philosophy became apparent. He
said: “The moment of experiencing
music is the only matter of importance.
The question of values is futile to pursue
since it is only related to a society.
And it is mere pretension to imagine
that one can have knowledge of a society
a hundred years hence. Let us be con-
cerned with our present. We can remem-
ber our past, we can dream of our
future, but we can live only with ‘now’.”


NEW ZEALAND NEWSLETTER
Haka for the Emperor
From MAURICE SHADBOLT in Auckland
The night Peter Snell won his second
gold medal for New Zealand at
the Olympic Games I drove out of
the quiet and leafy Auckland suburb in
which I live, and within a space of a
mile passed up to a dozen singleted
joggers all doubtless inspired by the
radio broadcast from Tokyo, and
apparently out on the road the instant
the result was announced.
Once the hefty All Black forward was
the physical symbol of New Zealand; in
the last four years it has become the
solitary jogger on the roadside. The
jogger can be any age, from fifteen to
fifty; he can be preparing for the next
Olympics, or he can be simply working
off a middle-aged spread.
Actually it all started in Rome —when
Snell the rank outsider won the 800
metres, Murray Halberg the 5000 metres,
and Barry Magee collected a bronze
medal in the marathon. What these
athletes had in common was a rather
unorthodox coach, Mr Arthur Lydiard,
who in 1960 was still unrecognised to the
extent that he had to pay his own way
to the Games. Lydiard has always
believed that nothing builds fitness quite
like distance the result being that a
middle distance runner like Snell is ex-
pected to jog up to 100 miles a week or
more in training.
Olympic fever ran high in the country
after Rome: small boys sprinted and
jogged away from cinemas which
screened the film of the Games. One
young athlete went to see the film no
less than six times and four years
later in Tokyo the same young man,
John Davies, collected a bronze medal in
the 1500 metres just behind team-mate
Snell.
Inspired by Lydiard, too, elderly
businessmen and even housewives began
to pace the roadsides. On any evening
in New Zealand, at any season of the
year, there are bound to be hundreds
jogging; the miracle so far is that none
of these nocturnal athletes have been
struck by cars. In September someone
jogged four hundred miles in ten days,
from Auckland to Wellington; as I write
someone else is jogging nearly seven
hundred miles from Cape Reinga, the
farthest tip of the North Island, to the
capital.
Anyway an Australian might be for-
given for thinking that, with three gold
medals and two bronzes (plus a few near-
misses) to set against a population of
less than three million, New Zealand
had reason to be pleased with itself
after Tokyo.
Not a bit of it.
In the first place, we clearly didn’t get
enough golds. Partly encouraged by
overseas sportswriters (and by one or
two local ones, too) many New
Zealanders anticipated cleaning up every
gold from the 800 metres to the 10,000
metres perhaps with the marathon
thrown in as a kind of bonus.
Plainly our new obsession with
athletics which probably will pro-
duce spectacular results in the future
had run away with us. Disappointment
was inevitable, and even Snell’s two
victories didn’t altogether assuage
the country’s pride.
Then there was that incident; and
national stocktaking became national
flagellation.
The incident is now familiar to those
who viewed television broadcasts of the
Games. It started harmlessly enough
with a Maori haka or war dance, that
old stand-by of Kiwis abroad, during the
closing day; the crowds at Tokyo weren’t
exactly seeing it for the first time Kiwi
spectators had leapt down on to the
cinder track to perform after both of
Snell’s victories.
This time it was the turn of a dozen
New Zealand athletes, who clowned it
up after the rest of the world’s sports-
men had marched from the stadium.
The group, which included some of the
most prominent members of the New
Zealand team, haka-ed around the track,
and finished up in front of Emperor
Hirohito.
Well, a war dance would have been
neither here nor there.
But then they began to bow—not once
or twice, but four or five times. And
the trouble began.
A panicky report from the New
Zealand Press Association man in Tokyo
suggested that mortal offence had been
given not only to Emperor Hirohito, but
to all Japan. “The gesture,” he said,
“was about as well received as mock
salutes would be in front of the Royal
box at Ascot . . . Japanese officials were
clearly dismayed.”
The country had something to get its
teeth into at last. Newspapers solemnly
editorialised; correspondents suggested,
with some hysteria, that the athletes
involved should be named and de-
nounced, and debarred from representing
New Zealand again. Prime Minister
Holyoake rose in Parliament to say he
was expecting a full report on the
incident.
It even seemed an official or informal
apology to Japan might be in order;
after all, our growing trade with that
country might be at stake. The orgy of
soul-searching went on for two or three
days; New Zealand literally hung its
head in shame.
But checks soon showed that the
Japanese themselves had taken the
incident lightly—it had merely been a
culmination of the high spirits and carni-
val atmosphere of the closing ceremony.
One Japanese daily newspaper said
“probably the Emperor had never before
received such a joyous and friendly fare-
well expressed with the whole body”.
Nevertheless, some emotionalism per-
sisted; not even Japanese reassurances
cleared the air. And the interesting
thing about it all, at this stage, is why
New Zealanders were so quick and will-
ing to believe the worst of themselves;
why a bit of horseplay, plus some slip-
shod journalism, should cause something
like national panic. Possibly nothing
could better illustrate the uncertainty
New Zealand now feels about itself in
relation to the outside world.
As the satirical versifier “Whim
Wham” (otherwise the well-known NZ
poet Allen Curnow) observed in “The
New Zealand Herald”:
This wouldn’t be the first (or worst)
Display
Of the Kiwi’s Habits when abroad —•
and All
Because the World's so big, and he’s so
small!
The dear wee Pet, he’s only trying to

Overseas.
TTUlking about New Zealand's place in
the world, it seems we might be due
for some second thoughts geographic-
ally and politically.
Straws in the wind: A prominent
geographer recently pointed out that it is
absurd to talk of South-East Asia as
being our “Near North”; Bangkok, he
observed, is no nearer to Wellington than
it is to London, and Peking is closer to
London than Wellington is to Saigon.
He added that the value of the term
“Near North” as a correction to New
Zealand's Anglo-centrism hardly out-
weighed its intended associations with
other more questionable, and at times
perverse concepts such as that the
country was or should be vitally involved
with Asia in both trade and defence.
Journalist Noel Holmes, writing in the
“Auckland Star” after a visit to
Malaysia, says he now finds it difficult
to go along with the “somewhat mystical”
line of reasoning that suggests New
Zealand’s destiny is bound up with South-
East Asia; he sees the future of the
country as much more closely bound up

with the South Pacific in general, Poly-
nesia in particular. “I would suggest
humbly,” he says, “that we got into the
Malaysian act through sheer habit—the
habit of where Britain goes (and, maybe,
where Australia goes) we go.”
Both New Zealand’s economic future
and the ideal of a non-political career
civil service have been called into ques-
tion by recent events in Wellington.
About mid-September of this year
political correspondents in the capital
began to hint that the head of the In-
dustries and Commerce Department, Dr
W. B. Sutch, might soon be asked to
retire, at the age of 57, after the com-
pletion of 40 years’ public service.
Dr Sutch has for many years been
the most prominent and newsworthy civil
servant in the country; he has also been
something of a bogey-man, or witch-
doctor, for New Zealanders who believe
the country’s economy should remain
entirely dependent on pastoral produce.
It is no secret that Dr Sutch is to the
Left politically (two books written as
Penguins, notably The Quest for Secu-
rity in New Zealand, made him more or
less the welfare state’s historian and
ideologist) but there has never been any
suggestion that he has been less than
competent or effective as a civil servant
under both Labor and National admini-
strations. Unlike most civil servants, his
flair for the catching phrase, his imagina-
tive approach to such subjects as in-
dustrial design, has brought him often
into the headlines and more often than
not into controversy; he is also a man
with a vision of the future —something
rare enough in New Zealand at the
moment. To summarise his views un-
pardonably, he sees the New Zealand of
the future as a specialist, modestly-
industrialised Switzerland of the South
Pacific. He has been articulate about this
vision, at times eloquent almost to the
point of arrogance: certainly he has
been impatient with those who believe
New Zealand can depend forever on
wool, meat and butterfat.
Like the farmers, say. It is probably
not true that the farmers of the country
are hostile to all local industry, but this
often appears to be the case. To be fair
they see farm labor continually attracted
to towns and cities by higher wages in
industry; they also see, often too plainly
much of that industry as uneconomic
excessively protected, and unproductive
as far as the country’s export income is
concerned —whereas their production is
vital to the welfare of the country. (Only
3 per cent of New Zealand’s exports are
at present in the form of manufactured
goods.)
TV) the farmers, then, Dr Sutch has be-
come a rather sinister figure—as if he
were the architect of all Government
policy rather than an administrator. As
their grievances have mounted through
the years, under both Labor and National
Governments, so has Dr Sutch’s use as
a whipping boy grown. Since the great
bulk of farmers support the National
Party, pressures and pleas “to do some-
thing about that man Sutch” must at
times have become fierce.
By mid-November it was indeed clear
that Dr Sutch had been asked to retire
from his post at the top of the Industries
and Commerce Department. Though he
was short of the normal retiring age for
civil servants, the loophole was that the
State Services Commission can ask for
retirement on the completion of 40 years’
service. Usually this is asked for only
in the case of ill health or other infirmity.
There was no question of this in the
present case: indeed, it is reported that
Dr Sutch has since been offered another
job in the civil service.
Inevitably, the question of political)
influence arose. Had the State Services)
Commission, in theory totally indepen-]
dent, been pressured by the National
Government to get rid of Dr Sutch? Had
the usually cautious Holyoake Cabinet
finally capitulated to the economic back-
woodsmen of the National Party?
The president of the Public Service
Association, Mr G. H. Sorrell, suggested!
that this was the case. He said the
Government had asked the State Services
Commission to dismiss Dr Sutch on the
grounds that he was “politically un-
acceptable”. Mr Sorrell added: “The
principle of a career public service un-
contaminated by political influence has
been a basic one in New Zealand for
over 50 years. If the Government con-
tinues its present course of action, it will
be clearly violating this principle. Worse
than that, it will be taking the first step
down the slippery slope that leads back
to the situation which prevailed in our
service before 1912, and which still
notoriously prevails in parts of the
United States’ Public Service—to wit, the
‘spoils system’, by which every service
job is subject to political patronage.”
Both Mr Holyoake and the chairman

C.I.G. is gases...harnessed
to the needs of industry
The new Chrysler factory at Tonsley Park,
Adelaide, needs vast quantities of oxygen for
welding purposes. C.I.G. meets the need with a
hugeV.l.E. (Vacuum Insulated Evaporator) which
can store 30,000 cubic feet of liquid oxygen. The
gas is piped right through the factory, to outlets
at every welding point. No time is wasted in
hauling cylinders around the plant. The supply of
oxygen never runs dry...C.I.G. tankers see to that.
Hundreds of other factories need an uninterrupted
supply of gases. We provide it. We supply gases
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, acetylene, Handigas
(LP Gas), argon, helium, neon, xenon, krypton.
They are available individually or in mixtures, in
cylinders or in bulk, with all the equipment and
technical aid you need to make them work.

This Vacuum insulated Evaporator (V.1.E.) is the latest develop-
ment for handling liquid oxygen in bulk and is unique to C.I.G It is
installed free of charge by C.1.G., and our tankers make deliveries of
oxygen as often as required. The smallest V.I.E. in common use has a
nominal capacity of 30,000 cu. ft., while larger sizes are available where
consumption justifies their use.

0 f the State Services Commission im-
mediately denied that political pressure
was involved. Both said the Commission
had acted with complete independence
in asking for Dr Sutch’s retirement
though it was true Government views,
along with others, might have been taken
into account.
To Mr Sorrell this v/as as good as an
admission of the main contention of the
(PSA —that Dr Sutch had been retired
on Government direction.
In the meantime, Dr Sutch himself has
remained aloof from the controversy—
in one of New Zealand’s most mag-
nificent hemes, which he built with his
own hands high on a hilltop above the
capital city.
If the PSA claim of political pressure
is justified—and on the surface there is
a strong case —it is nevertheless difficult
to see the National Government going
any further in an effort to please its
farmer supporters: New Zealand industry
is unlikely to be thrown to the dogs; or,
rather, to be stripped of protection and
left to the keen winds of international
competition, to survive as best it can or
go under. Full employment is the first
article of faith in the welfare state. With-
put the development of local industry
[over the last 25 years, unemployment
I would have been widespread. But that
is still no help to the New Zealand
| farmer, often struggling on unwieldy
acreages with little or no hired labor at
all. Nor is it much help, for that matter,
to the New Zealand consumer as such:
he pays, and pays dearly, for the pro-
ducts of local industry; excessive pro-
tection has created monopoly after
monopoly which rides roughshod over
the New Zealand consumer.
With or without Dr Sutch, the dilemma
is still there.
VTew Zealand’s tiny comic-opera Com-
-1 munist Party is having its problems,
too. With all of 400 members, it has
received a disproportionate amount of
attention in the world Press since it
swung to the pro-Peking line; its leader,
general secretary Mr Vic Wilcox, seems
these days to spend more time in China
than outside it.
Local rejoicing over Khrushchev’s fall
was short-lived. The first major defection
from the NZCP since it turned pro-
Peking took place last month in Christ-
church. Party membership in Christ-
church (population 232,000) is reported
to have slumped from 40 to 20!

The Pope in India
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN in Bombay
Cardinal Gracias, Archbishop of
Bombay, is tall and slender and
dark, and he is wholly Indian. He
speaks in the pleasant sing-song of the
educated Indian, and he is at present host
to the Pope in this vast and tumultuous
city of Bombay.
All week Bombay has been the scene
of an International Eucharistic Congress.
In the past, these Congresses have been
triumphant, even nationalist, occasions,
particularly when they occur in Catholic
countries. Troops parade, cannons fire,
Governments kneel and the State
indulges itself in an orgy of pious self-
congratulation.
But not in Bombay. Here the Catholics
are less than four million out of India’s
400 million. They are ancient in origin.
St Thomas, the doubting apostle, is
claimed with some historical justification
as the founder of Christianity here. His
reputed tomb is in an Indian Church.
Missionaries from Persia founded sects
here. St Francis Xavier and a host of
Jesuits worked here.
But the fact remains that all forms of
Christianity are suspect in India. It is
a faith associated with foreign con-
querors. Missionaries are suspect as
religious imperialists, and each convert
to the Christian religion is regarded as
in some way a loss to India.
To hold a Eucharist Congress in India,
was, therefore, an act of almost rash
courage. It was the Cardinal’s decision,
and it was he who invited the Pope to
attend. But a very special and different
character has been given to this Con-
gress.
Of course it is a splendid occasion.
A vast white altar has been set up in
the centre of the city. Places for 180,000
worshippers have been set out. Great
choirs sing hymns in Latin and English
and the Indian tongues. Dark-faced
bishops and priests high above the
enormous crowds move through the
ancient ritual in the cool of the evening.
■ 1
During the long services a great crowd!
taking its evening walk shuffles slowly ,
past the confines of the place usurped by!;
the Catholics. There has been bitter/,
criticism in the Indian Parliament of the:
Congress. Hindu extremist groups have r
protested against this foreign intrusion \i
Missionaries have been wildly accusedl 1
of currency smuggling, of buying con- ;
verts, of being foreign agents. And yetis
with a marvellous tolerance the Congress''
has been accepted and even welcomed,
Few men have received the sort of ,
unorganised welcome that the Pope got
as he drove into Bombay. His rich stole’
hidden under the traditional Indian gar-
lands, his hands joined in the Indian’
greeting, he drove in an open car past.
crowds that blotted jut the broken side- 1
walks and the slums. The Indians under-j
stood that a compliment had been in-
tended for them by his coming and they
marvellously returned it.
Despite the Roman splendors this has\i
been a different sort of Congress. The/,
Indian President, Vice-President and

the Pope. And the whole
occasion has been given somehow not an
alien, not a Roman but an Indian
character. If it celebrates the Eucharist
it also celebrates the essentially Indiai
character of this Church. \
Elaborate care has been taken not tr
offend. Elaborate protestations havil
been made that no conversions are beinj 1
sought. The English Archbishop c 1
Westminster raised a storm of applausi 1

Next Step in Saigon
From GODFREY HODGSON in Washington
There does not seem to be the slight-
est possibility of President Johnson
taking any decision about Vietnam
that would lead either to war or to
negotiations with China. That is the
view of well-informed people here.
But he is being pressed to do some-
thing between these extremes.
General Maxwell Taylor, the United
States Ambassador in Saigon, who is iff
charge of the enormous American effort
to shore up the faltering Government of
South Vietnam, had talks here last week
with Mr Rusk, the Secretary of State,
and Mr McNamara, Secretary of De*

Rome, Nasser
and the Jews
By EMERY BARCS
The Moslem leaders of the Arab world
A have become the most furious op-
ponents of the Ecumenical Council’s
decision to declare the Jews not guilty of
the crucifixion of Christ some 19 cen-
turies ago. They are certainly not inter-
ested in the theological part of the some-
what belated acquittal. But they would
like to see the charge kept alive. For
the accusation of deicide has been always
one of the most useful items in the
varied propaganda arsenal of religious,
racial and economic anti-Semitism.
It was the late Pope John XXIII who
entrusted in 1960 his friend the German
Cardinal Augustin Bea with the task of
preparing a concise statement about the
theological relationship between Christi-
anity and Judaism which would liquidate
for all times the ancient Christian
‘hebraeophobia”.
1 At the end of 1961 the document (De
Catholicorum habitudine ad non-Christi-
anos, et maxime Judaeos) was ready. It
was only 800 words long. But it demo-
lished centuries of superstitions.
“The church of Christ,” said the state-
ment, “recognises with gratitude that the
beginnings of its religion . . . must be
found in the Patriarchs and in the Pro-
phets. The Church admits that all
Christians are religiously the sons of
Abraham . . . Christ’s death could not
have been caused by a whole people and
even less by a people which lives today
. . . The Church does not forget that
Jesus in the flesh was born from the
Jewish people, as were the Virgin Mary
and the Apostles, the foundation-stones
and pillars of the Church . . .”
After long debates last November,
before recessing for the year, the Vati-
can Council approved a draft declaration
which said Jews could not be held respon-
sible for the crucifixion because Christ
died for all the sins of mankind. This
draft will be finally adopted when the
Council meets again next year.
But even before this declaration was
adopted the Arab leaders denounced it
as the “result of an imperialistic-Zionist
conspiracy” to help the Jews to remain
in possession of Palestine.
It seems, however, that the Arab
leaders have come to the conclusion that
if they wanted to make their political
manoeuvre really potent, they had to
inject religion into it
Last October Amin-al-Hafez, Syria’s
strongman, fired the first shot in this
campaign when he summoned the heads
of the small but very ancient Maronite,
Melkite and Assyrian Christian Churches
and told them that as Christians and
Syrian patriots they ought to reject the
pending acquittal of the Jews.
Nothing further was heard about such
a move until a fortnight ago when the
“Coptic Pope”, Kyrillos VI, announced
that he summoned a Council of Coptic
bishops and elders in Alexandria. The
main task of this Council will be to pre-
pare a conference of all orthodox
Churches which will be asked to reaffirm
the damnation of Jews for the murder of
Christ.
The Copts seceded from the main body
of Christianity after the Council of Chal-
cedon (451 A.D.) which condemned the
doctrine developed by the Coptic theolo-
gian Eutyches that the divine and the
human in Christ constituted a nature
absolutely one. (The victorious doctrine
of Nestorius stated that the divine and
human natures of Christ were “con-

Although they now speak Arabic and
live like Arabs the estimated 4,000,000
Copts of Egypt, one-sixth of the coun-
try’s total population, are said to be the
racially “purest” descendants of the
ancient Egyptians. Religion has pre-
vented them from inter-marrying with
the Moslem Arabs. They still maintain
numerous desert monasteries and con-
vents and a large clergy.
Outside Egypt the Copts are influen-
tial only in Abyssinia where their
Church is the official Church of the
State. The Coptic Patriarch who has
his seat in Cairo appoints (with the
Emperor’s consent) the head of the
Abyssinian Church, the Abuna of Gon-
dar.
The Coptic clergy has no great repu-
tation of learning and sophistication. For
centuries it has had to concentrate its
efforts on surviving under the mounting
pressure from Islam. For the past 1500
years it has shown no interest in esta-
blishing close contacts with other Christ-
ian Churches, So the suspicion seems to
be justified that the sudden move of
Kyrillos VI into the international field
has been prompted by President Nasser’s
regime which will have to foot the bill for
the planned Councils. For while the
Coptic Church in Abyssinia is quite
wealthy it is very poor in Egypt.
It is rather unlikely that the Abyssinian
branch will give considerable financial
assistance to the Egyptian Copts; at least
not if Emperor Haile Selassie can help
it. His Majesty is not only proud of
his title of the Lion of Juda and of his
legendary descent from King Solomon
and the Queen of Sheba but he has the
friendliest contacts with Israel. Israel
has provided Abyssinia with valuable
technical assistance for years. Abyssi-
nian students are being trained at the
University of Jerusalem.
A far more important question is how
the leaders of the Eastern Orthodox
Churches will react to an invitation to
go to Alexandria next year to damn the
Jews. For centuries there has been a
quiet but persistent rivalry for predo-
minance between the Patriarchs of Con-
stantinople and of Moscow for the leader-
ship of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
Under the Czars Russia tried to exploit
religion for political purposes in Eastern
Europe as well as in the Middle East.
Since the end of World War II the Krem-
lin leaders have tried to follow a similar
trend. The head of the Russian Ortho-
dox Church, Patriarch Alexis, has been
allowed to go abroad on missions in
which pro-Soviet propaganda played at
least as much part as did religion.
Athenagoras I, Patriarch of Constan-
tinople, is known to favor closer co-
operation with Rome. Therefore he might
be reluctant to affix his signature to a
declaration of Jewish guilt which would
amount to a direct challenge to the Holy
See.
On the other hand the Russians might
attempt to use the Council of Alexandria
for their own purposes. Anti-Semitism,

this abominable myth whatever the
Ecumenical Council would do about it
when it meets next year.
China’s Bomb
The following two editorial comments
front:Left-arid Right-wing US magazines
indicate in their opposed ways the
divergence of American:from Australian
opinion over the Chinese bomb.
President Johnson’s main foreign
policy tasks are to learn how to
live with a China that now has
the atomic bomb, and a Europe that
still, for the most part, hasn’t. China’s
bomb is not likely to have much military
significance for a long time, but that
is beside the point. The point is that
the bomb has become a political factor
whose importance increases almost in
proportion as the serious chances of its
being used as a military weapon de-
crease ... If the US can only extricate
itself from the Vietnam mess without
too much loss of face, the task in Asia
becomes mainly one of probing Chinese
intentions. The Johnson Administration
will find it cannot do this off in a corner
in Warsaw, especially if, as seems likely,
the Chinese soon take their place in the
United Nations. Would a China that
was in the UN in fact try using force
against either India or an independent
Taiwan that had the US for an ally? In
the balance of terror, China occupies a
very inferior position. In Asia, as in
Europe, the real questions are ad-
mittedly thanks mainly to American
military strength—political not martial,
and call for political not military
manoeuvres.
The New Republic
two or three years, Communist
China will be able to mount a direct
nuclear threat to the major cities of
India, Pakistan and the entire western
Pacific. Within less than a decade that
threat will become global. Already its
premonitory political repercussions are
being felt in Tokyo, Manila, Saigon,
Djakarta, Moscow and indeed every-
where. There is not the slightest doubt
that, if the present outlook holds, the
political and strategic position of the
United States throughout the western
Pacific will soon begin to erode rapidly.
It is probably impossible to prevent
the Chinese from acquiring a nuclear
capability some time. But it is entirely
possible, comparatively easy, and not
very risky to delay that achievement for
at least five, possibly ten years. All that
need be done is to destroy the present
Chinese reactors. Their location is
known. The Chinese possess no means
of defence. The Russians however
they might bleat afterward would
most certainly do nothing to help the
Chinese save their installations; indeed
they might even give clandestine aid to
their elimination; and are not likely to
renew the technical aid that made them
possible in the first place. The action
could probably be carried out without
losses; conceivably without Chinese losses,
since it would seem safe enough to give
a few hours’ warning to permit evacua-
tion of personnel.

A Merry Xmas to all
FROM THE CHIED EXECUTIVE
The spiritual and historical significance of Christmas
has a place in our business community of no less
importance than in our personal life. As 1964 draws
to a close, it is an appropriate time to reflect upon our
achievements of the past year—to judge whether our
actions could have been different. As individuals, we
have but one life of service to offer to our fellow men —
as a Company, we have a continuing mandate to offer
service to all those we are privileged to serve. Let us
resolve in all the years still given to us, to be both
cheerful and diligent servants so that our families and
our Company may prosper. As citizens, let us be
conscious of the wonderful land in which we live and
resolve to work with all other nations and peoples in
fulfilling the true message of Christmas—
Peace on Earth
Goodwill to all men.
A very happy Christmas and a prosperous and
peaceful New Year.

APART of the spirit of Christmas is giving. Brambles made
Commonwealth-wide Christmas donations of equipment to the
Australian Red Cross Society, and in Sydney, fourteen wheelchairs
were presented to the New South Wales Division at the Red Cross
Two of the wheelchairs were of a new fully-immersible type, for
use in showers, or for wheeling patients into a swimming pool.
The chairs were received for the Society by the Chairman, Mr
J. F. Clack, CBE, the General Secretary, Mr R. J. S. Seddon, and
Miss Margaret Waddell, the Hon. Director of Branches. The chairs
were presented by the Chief Executive and General Manager of
Brambles Industries Ltd, Mr Warwick J. Holcroft (2nd from right)
accompanied by other executives of the company.
CHRISTMAS festivities were ushered into Sydney this year with
the now famous annual Waratah Spring Festival.
Whilst flowers and beautiful girls were the dominating features
in the Festival Pageant, transport, too, proved an interesting
spectacle. Clowns were riding bicycles and scooters, enthusiasts
drove their antique and vintage cars and the racing fans their new
model sports cars. Some of the transport was not so obvious.
Semi-trailers were so shrouded in flowers and decorations that not
even the drivers were visible.
A sight which some of the younger spectators would never have
seen on Sydney’s streets was a vintage tram mounted on a low
loader of 25 tons capacity from Brambles modern heavy haulage
fleet in Sydney.

N°T so many years ago, the bullock teams used to drag their
heavy loads through the outback . . . long columns of
teams and carts, braving dust, poor roads and torrential rains.
Today, trucks have replaced the bullocks and their carts, but
the outback is just as inhospitable. Brambles learned this
recently while completing a modern day “re-enactment” of the
long outback treks.
Thirty-two Brambles heavy haulage units from Sydney,
Port Kembla, Melbourne and Adelaide Branches converged
at Port Campbell, Victoria, to move 550 tons of oil rig to
Gidgealpa, South Australia. The lift over 1,200 miles was for
Drilling Contractors (Australia).
From Broken Hill the convoy travelled over rough gravel,
rocky desert, boulder-strewn creekbeds and drifting sand.
The vehicles and their crews had to carry their own fuel, food
and spares for the last 400 miles of the trek.
The outback weather was typically unpredictable. While the
leading trailers were driving through dust and sand in oppressive
heat, the rear of the convoy was held back for days by torren-
tial rains and mud. The picture shows a section of the convoy
held up by the thick mud, while storm clouds threaten overhead.

Chep at the Opera House
service technicians are in constant demand,
not only to service CHEP machines out on hire,
but to attend to equipment owned and operated by
other companies. Here a CHEP technician, working
from his radio-controlled service van, makes repairs
to a unit owned and operated by the Sydney Opera
House contractors, M. R. HORNIBROOK LTD.
In the background a CHEP fork-lift truck on hire at
the Opera House site keeps vital materials moving.
For the impossible ...
see Brambles
*T*0 Brambles, the impossible takes no longer . . .
A it just requires a little extra ingenuity. This
vessel, weighing 6 tons and 16 feet 4i inches in
diameter, had to be moved from Pt Adelaide to
Whyalla. The maximum overall load height allowed
on the route is 17 feet and most advisors declared
a one-load movement to be impossible. But Brambles-
Lee solved the problem with careful calculations
and several detours on the route. The journey was
made with a road clearance of only 5i inches, but
the height of the load was 2 inches under the limit.
Brambles cranes in action
f |N the site of Sydney's Royal Exchange and
” Aarons Hotel, cranes from Brambles Industrial
Services aid in demolition work. Built in the 1870s,
the Royal Exchange and Aarons was for many years
the meeting place for wool growers on visits to
Sydney. The building is being demolished to make
way for a new prestige office block.


“23,500
New
Horses
23,500 new horses are in Bram-
bles “stables”. With expenditure of
just over one million pounds since
June this year, new cranes and
other vehicles with horsepower
totalling 23,500 have been pur-
chased to replace retiring units and
to add to the already vast fleets,
always ready to meet the growing
demand for Brambles movement
services.
Typical of the specialised service
units purchased by Brambles are
the six imported Kenworth prime-
movers, which will be used to haul
liquids and powdered products over
long distances.
With the additional Kenworth
units, the Liquid Cartage division
of Brambles will more than ever
become an extension of customers'
production services by moving bulk
products from one factory to
another for further processing.
One of Brambles L.P.G. tankers coupled to an existing Kenworth prime-mover ,
which operates regular services between Sydney and Melbourne.
Brambles six new Kenworth prime-movers ready for service. The units will be
coupled with tankers to haul bulk liquids and powders long distances across
Australia.
Queensland Moves
Matching the tremendous industrial growth in Queensland,
Brambles have regrouped a number of services, at the same
time extending heavy haulage operations into Brisbane.
CHEP (formerly the Commonwealth Handling Equipment
Pool) will specialise in fork lift and pallet hiring services to
the Brisbane waterfront and other industries throughout the
metropolitan area.
A new unit of Brambles Industrial Services, equipped with
modern low loaders and jinkers up to 40 tons, has been estab-
lished and based in Brisbane, to provide an expanded service
to the Industrial and Civil contracting organisations of
Queensland.
The former crane section of CHEP, now part of Brambles
Industrial Services, has been expanded by the introduction of
three heavy mobile cranes each capable of lifts in excess of
33 tons.
Mr J. E. (Jack) Robinson, Manager of CHEP Brisbane for
the past six years, Has been appointed Queensland manager
of Brambles Holdings Ply Limited, the controlling company

AGANST THE CURRENT
The Passenger ...
A Short Story by John Gale
64 tuan. The tyre is broken.
Must have new tyre.” The garage
attendant had shrugged and
giggled.
He swore to himself. What a godfor-
saken country and a godforsaken bunch
of giggling lunatics running it. No good
asking the garage if they stocked tyres.
He laughed at the phrase. Nothing in
Indonesia stocked anything as far as
he could see. You even had to antici-
pate blowouts a year in advance. Of
course, it would happen when he was in
a tearing hurry and when he had left the
spare at work for a retread.
He strode out of the garage into
Djakarta's midday chaos. Today of all
days, he muttered. If I’m not stark,
staring mad after another month in this
hole, it’ll be a miracle. God, these
people cluttering up the road, shouldn't
be allowed. Damn this heat. The
smells, the ragged, skinny human beings,
all ready to take a white man down,
the nightmare jumble of cars and
bicycles pressing down on the steaming
asphalt almost made him physically ill.
At least there was still a taxi left. He
started across the road.
“Taxi!”
Car horns and betjak bells reached a
crescendo as he dashed through their
lines, tall and conspicuous.
Let’s hope this heap of metal will get
me there in one piece.
“To the kota, Mangga Besar. How
much?”
“One thousand rupiah, tuan.”
“What do you think I am, a million-
aire? Three hundred.”
“Not possible, tuan. Petrol cost much,
tyres cost much. For you, seven fifty.”
“Five hundred.” He enjoyed bargain-
ing, beating these little fellows down. And
five hundred at black-market rate was
only three and sixpence.
“And make it snappy . . .”
At the driver’s enquiring smile, he
shouted again: “Step on it, pronto,
tjepat .”
They lurched off into the river of
jostling vehicles, the slow-moving lava,
an eruption of metal and flesh.
The business with the shipping people
shouldn’t take too long. He could tele-
phone the office from there and get one
of their drivers to get that tyre to the
garage and get a car sent down to pick
him up. Hell, the telephone. Damn
Indonesians couldn’t even run a simple
telephone exchange.
“Tuan from America?” The taxi-
driver smiled into the rear-vision mirror.
“No. Australia.”
Blast these talkative blokes. He always
seemed to get stuck with Indonesians
that couldn’t keep their mouths shut for
a minute. Come to think of it, that
wretched telephone had been the cause
of all his troubles that day.
“Australia nice country. Nice people.
Not like Americans, not like Russians.”
If they did a little less talking and a
little more action, their wretched country
might have a chance.
“Tuan, how many children?”
“Two.” God, they get personal.
“Tuan, I nine children. Much happi-
ness, but much poor.” The driver
giggled.
Somebody ought to do these loons a
favor and tell them about the pill. Over-
sexed, that’s their trouble.
He had tried for more than an hour
to dial the simple kota number that
morning. Of course, kota wouldn’t be
transferred to the automatic exchange
lor months, years, and if you had to
depend on those crazy Indonesian opera-
tors, you might as well stop trying. He
should have known better, should have
taken the car and gone straight down
to the agent’s office at 8 a.m.
“Tuan long in Indonesia?”
Too bloody long. Then out loud:
“Listen, do you think you could step on
it, mate? Just quit the natter and get
me down town.”
“Sorry?”
“Fast, tjepat."
The car made a token jerk forward,
almost collecting a row of stalls as it
overtook a utility on the left. Grinning
into the mirror the driver said:
“Nine children, one wife, 15 years.
Good, ugh?”
He had tried to telephone his office
from the garage after the blowout. He
might just as well have saved himself the
trouble. Then he had to get this chat-
tering idiot for a driver.
Steam began to ascend from the
radiator, He tensed. If this heap conks
out now, I shall wring this grinning
idiot’s neck for him. They steamed
along, the boiling radiator making no
difference. Probably tied together with
string, he thought bitterly. Probably
boils every other hour. I get a simple
blowout and the car’s out of action for
days.
“Tuan touris?”
“Stuck here, worse luck.”
How could he let Mary know he'd
be late for the lunch at the Hotel Indo-
nesia. Then there was that cursed
cocktail do at six. What a day.
“Tuan like Indonesia? Indonesians
very friendly but poor.”
“Too friendly.” God, how they chat-
ter. If we had any sense we’d leave
this country alone. No trade, no nothing.
Much better off all round. How could
you hope to run a business when it took
two hours to make a phone call. He
could take Mary and the kids back home
to Sydney. They’d all be a lot happier.
Salary would only be half as much as
here, but then to stick a hardship post
like Djakarta, you certainly deserved
double pay. In the heat and the milling
traffic he longed for evening, a cool,
quiet evening at his house in Kebajoran.
The cool evening, the air-conditioned
bedroom, the duty-free gin he had
wangled through some diplomatic con-
tacts.
“Here, tuan?”
“Right.” He gave the driver the five
hundred.
“Tuan,” the driver smiled, looking

hurt. “Nine children, tuan. Five hun-
dred not yet rice for one day.”
Crawling blighter. See a foreigner
and they think he’s made of money. It
was the principle of the thing.
“Skat, it's more than this heap’s
worth.”
“Cigarettes, tuan?”
What a hide. Sends me crazy with his
chatter and now expects smokes. He
threw the last of the pack into the front
seat, as he turned away.
TTe wiped some dust off the windscreen.
AJL He was pleased with his decision.
He would buy a bed. Nothing fancy,
just one of those little wooden ones.
True, such a bed would last only a year
or so. Wood on a dirt floor in this
climate was hopeless, but you needed
thousands for a good iron bed. No, the
wooden one would be good enough for
his mother-in-law.
The tall, red-faced European striding
along the other side of the road caught
his eye. Always rushing, these foreign-
ers. Let’s hope he needs a taxi. I could
do with some good fares. Should be
able to get five hundred at least from
this one.
“Taxi!” What loud voices they have,
always shouting. He tucked his rag in
his pocket. I can get the bed tonight
at the market; should be able to get the
price down to five hundred. He smiled
at the foreigner.
“To the kota, Mangga Besar. How
much?”
“One thousand rupiah, tuan.”
“What do you think I am, a million-
aire? Three hundred.”
“Not possible, tuan. Petrol cost much,
tyres cost much. For you, seven fifty.”
“Five hundred.”
He opened the door of the taxi in
consent. If it had been an Indonesian
he could have expected three fifty at the
most.
“And make it snappy . . . step on it,
pronto, t/epaf.”
He started up the engine. His wife
had heard the week before that her
mother was coming from Central Java
to pay them a visit. An extra person
around will be a help, especially now that
the baby is almost here. But they had
only two beds, and the mother-in-law
would never consent to taking a mat on
the ground with the other children. One
bed was for him and his wife, the other,
more of a bench than a bed, was for
his second daughter. The doctor at the
clinic said she must sleep off the ground
because of her lungs. That morning,
after a week of deliberation, they had
decided to invest in a third bed.
He bestowed a smile on the sweating
passenger who would enable them to
make their purchase. Big enough, hairy
enough for a Russian, but he didn’t
speak Indonesian, and Russians were
never tourists, and only tourists took
taxis.
“Tuan from America?”
“No. Australia.”
Same difference, he thought, except
their English is harder to understand.
They look so serious all the time, these
whites. This one looked ready to run
amuck. He felt suffocated by the large-
ness of the man in the back, his loua
voice and his angry face.
“Australia nice country, nice people.
Not like Americans, not like Russians.”
He might get an extra tip if he was
polite. Just act as if this passenger was
a visitor at his house. He smiled again.
“Tuan, how many children? He
watched the man’s face in the mirror.
“Two.”
Perhaps that’s what made these whites
so bad-tempered. Not enough children.
He pitied them.
“Tuan, I nine children. Much happi-
ness, but much poor.” But he was forget-
ting his guest.
“Tuan long in Indonesia?”
“Listen, do you think you could step
on it, mate? Just quit the natter and get
me down town.”
Couldn’t understand a word of that.
“Sorry?”
“Fast, tjepat .”
He thought better of repeating his last
question and slid round the left of the
utility in front.
His wife would be pleased that they
could get the bed today. They had
three hundred already saved. What was
the use of keeping your money these
days. Things weren't getting any better,
getting worse in fact. He thought of his
nine children, the tenth on the way.
“Nine children, one wife, 15 years.
Good, ugh?”
He looked in the mirror.
“Tuan touris?”
He smiled cheerfully. It was certainly
hard going, making conversation with
this one.
“Stuck here, worse luck.”
And when he does answer I can’t un-
derstand a word.
“Tuan like Indonesia? Indonesians
friendly but poor.” The exact opposite
of the white man on both counts.
“Too friendly.” He smiled, pleased
to get a reaction from his passenger
which he understood. The one year
English he had done at junior high school
years ago had stood him in good stead,
but too still meant the same to him as
very.
He turned into Mangga Besar.
“Here, tuan?”
“Right.”
He took the five hundred rupiah. Might
as well try for that extra fifty.
“Tuan, nine children, tuan. Five hun-
dred not yet rice for one day.”
“Skat, it’s more than this heap’s
worth.”
Then he spotted the pack of filter
cigarettes in the man’s shirt pocket.
Foreign cigarettes brought about fifteen
rupiah each.
“Cigarettes, tuan?”
He smiled at the angry man as he
accepted the pack. Five cigarettes,
seventy-five rupiah. He could sell them
that night before he went to get the bed.

term such as New Guineans be adopted.

Academic Salaries
SlR.—Professor Armstrong’s remarks
on academic salaries (8., Nov. 21) calls
for reply.
1. He says that the salaries of
senior members are already high by the
standards of the community. Such ex-
pressions hardly make sense in the con-
text of Armstrong’s well-known enthu-
siasm for capitalist economies. For so
long as he prefers a general system that
relies heavily upon financial incentives,
Armstrong’s egalitarianism must be re-
garded as merely romantic. Jn any case
it is not a simple truth that our salaries
are already high by the standards of the
community. Compared with a bricklayer
I may be overpaid, but compared with a
large class of business men of moderate
ability I am not.
2. It is true that in Australia more
money needs to be spent on research and
library facilities and it may be true that
“it is good conditions for research and
teaching that attracts and holds men of
ability to universities”. Yet it is foolish
to think that we will ever be able to
compete in these respects with the best
institutions overseas. It seems, then,
that our only hope of attracting staff
from abroad is to appeal to their pockets.
I was recently persuaded to return to
Australia by such an appeal. Oxford is
a more interesting city than Brisbane, if
only because it is visited more often by
Professor Armstrong. I doubt whether
I would have come here from Oxford
for anything but money. Armstrong’s
letter shows no appreciation of the fact
that we cannot survive unless w-e attract
staff from overseas, nor of the fact that
academic salaries in England have re-
cently been increased by about twenty per
cent.
3. On one point I agree with Arm-
strong. It is unfortunate that the great-
est increases of those recently accepted
by the Federal Government went to
senior staff. Our real recruiting problem
seems to be at the lectureship level.
Further I am quite certain with Arm-
strong that anything which “tends to
perpetuate the hierarchical structure of
our universities” is deplorable. I would
like to see the whole structure of our
universities revised so that power belong-
ed ultimately to the academic body as a
whole rather than to professors and se-
nior administrators. I take it that Arm-
strong’s remarks reflect similar views.
4. Yet his thinking about the pro-
per organisation of a university is pretty
confused. This is shown by his advocacy
of the “US system of salaries fixed by
individual negotiation”. This system
would produce a much greater salary
spread than the present one. Armstrong
thinks a salary spread tends to perpetuate
the hierarchical structure of our univer-
sities. If he is right, then we may pre-
sume that the system of individual nego-
tiation would be unlikely to undermine
that structure.
5. Finally I would ask Armstrong
to consider what would now be the con-
ditions of Australian universities if those
academics who have opposed as un-
necessary every salary increase for the
last ten years had been successful on
each occasion. Perhaps some sort of
case can be made against each proposed
increase taken singly. Yet it does not
seem true that over the last ten years
academics have improved their position
with respect to the rest of the commu-
nity. It may be that they ought not even
to have maintained their position. That
is a possible view and it may be Arm-
strong’s. But I doubt whether he would
be prepared to accept the consequences
of such a view for our universities.

The Folk People
SIR. It is apparent from the volume
of correspondence that Mr Charles
Higham's article on The Folk People
(8., November 14) is so near the
truth that it hurts. The only criticism
I have with the article is that Mr Higham
treated “them” too softly. I've seen all
these people in all their .made over haunts
from Brisbane to Adelaide—never did
get to Perth—and what worries me is that
most of these people while professing
affiliation with “working class folk” will
still be driving their daddy’s or their
own cars to their psuedo atticks while
the majority of the folk they purport to
represent will be doing the two-year

Viols , Not Violas
SIR.—To forestall protests and resolve
puzzlements, I should explain that it was
apparently a gremlin in The Bulletin’s
printing department that transformed all
my viols into violas in the review of the
New York Pro Musica recording of
“Music in Shakespeare’s Time’’ (8.,
December 5). True, a viol was a viola
(da gamba ) in the ancient sense; but
the modern viola comes from a different
branch of the family C da braccio whence
its German name, Bratsche). It is no
wonder that gremlins become confused.

REVIEWS
LETTER FROM LONDON
Britain’s Television Blues
By CHARLES OSBORNE
The television networks, both BBC and
ITV, like to be thought of as con-
tributing importantly to the nation’s
culture. They may not have any very
clear idea of just what this entails;
nevertheless that, when they hear the
word culture, they reach for their
consciences is clear from the plethora
of new or resuscitated features paying
some degree of lip-service to the idea
that people do read, look at pictures,
or have ideas occasionally.
Many people had innocently expected
the BBC’s second channel to be a kind
of TV version of the Third Programme,
although my own fear in advance was
that it would more likely resemble a
giant Adult Education Course. We were
all wrong. It opened with neither bang
nor whimper: it opened with “Kiss Me,
Kate”, and rapidly established itself as a
somewhat worse BBC-1. This is a typical
evening programme:
7.35 Time Out. A weekly pro-
gramme on the expanding world
of leisure, including, this week,
“Rugby the struggle for a
Blue”.
8.25 The Great War. Part 25 of a
26-part history of the 1914-18
War.
9.05 A play ( A good play? No. A
new play? No): “Simon and
Laura” by Alan Melville.
10.25 Wheelbase. Covers the world
of motor-cycling.
10.45 Newsroom. Followed by The
Weather.
BBC-2 has, however, created one new
programme of marginal interest to those
who read books. It’s called “Take It or
Leave It”, and it’s a bowdlerised version
of a literary panel-game devised by
Brigid Brophy for the World Book Fair
at Earls’ Court earlier this year. A
chairman (Robert Robinson) and four
literary “personalities” (these have so
far included John Betjeman, Anthony
Burgess, Elizabeth Jane Howard, An-
thony Blond and Bernard Levin) listen
to an actor reading a short extract from
a book. They are then invited to guess
the author and title of the book and,
having done so, to discuss among them-
selves their reaction to the writer and
his way of writing. The game is simple,
indeed pointless, and the extracts (from
Chaplin’s autobiography, Durrell’s Alex-
andria Quartet, Edward Lear) are usually
quickly identified, although, this week,
after listening to a paragraph from
Somerset Maugham’s “Rain”, all four
panellists tried to place it well back in
the 19th century—a fair comment on
Maugham, perhaps.
The success of the programme depends
purely on the personalities of the “per-
sonalities”. Bernard Levin’s quick in-
telligence is at the mercy of his earnest
manner, John Betjeman’s innocent
charm works like magic, and so on.
BBC-1 and ITV each have programmes
which to some extent attempt to appeal
to a sophisticated intelligence. In almost
all of them, a difficulty arises when,
through either greed or lack of con-
fidence, the producer tries to attract both
an interested minority-audience and a
mass-audience.
“Not So Much a Programme, More
a Way of Life” is the embarrassingly
pretentious title of BBC-l’s successor to
“That Was The Week, That Was”. The
new show is being put out three nights a
week, though my guess is that they won’t
be able to keep it up for long. A dread-
ful song ushers the programme in each
evening: “Not so much a programme,
more a way of life/And a way of looking
at the world/One eye open wide, one
eye closed/So between the two the
picture gets composed . . .” There follow
45 minutes of hesitant, clumsy, sixth-
form raillery from David Frost who is
simply inept now that he is apparently
not allowed to bite, William Rushton
saddled with the most inane of scripts,
and a smirking nonentity who used to
be the poet P. J. Kavanagh. The pro-
gramme is completely witless.
In form and technique, though not in
content, it has something in common
with ITV’s “Eamonn Andrews Show”.
If this were the Somebody Else Show
it could easily be a pleasant, discursive,
loose-jointed informal programme of
talk: guests come and go: Lord Boothby
outrageously overplaying the lovably out-
rageous peer, Clement Freud being
pleasantly bland and witty, the occasional
nut case. But Mr Andrews himself does
not fit very comfortably into all this. He
more often than not appears to be un-
easily out of his depth and is, any way,
hardly commanding enough to be able
cunningly to shape the content of the
discussion.
Only one more programme remains
to be seriously considered: “Monitor”,
the BBC-1 equivalent of “Tempo”. For
over six years it suffered from being edit-
ed and managed by Huw Wheldon who
somehow contrived to make his lack of
knowledge of the arts positively offensive.
His unfailing ability to reduce any
potentially interesting discussion to a
level of cosy banality was combined with
an oddly patronising attitude to the
creative artists he frequently interviewed.
Now Jonathan Miller (ex-“ Beyond the
Fringe”) has taken over “Monitor”. His
intention, he says, is to devote the pro-
gramme to an investigation of the world
of 20th-century ideas. Whether this
means anything at all, we shall have to
wait and see. The beginning was rather
less than promising. Miller appeared to
be unconsciously parodying himself, and
an American critic, Susan Sontag, proved
to be the most boring person to hit
British TV since well, anyway, since
Douglas-Home’s debut.
Postscript: TAM, the television audi-
ence research firm, has just revealed that
the estimated audience for “Not So Much
a Programme” on its first night was
2,568,000 (considerably fewer than
“’TW3” used to attract). On the second
night this figure had already dropped to
2,028,000. And on the third night,
1,217,000.
ART
A Visionary Sculptress
Recent Australian Sculpture. Queensland
Art Gallery, Brisbane.
As well as presenting the work of several
prominent sculptors to the general
public, this show should greatly enhance
the status of sculpture generally in this
country, although it offers few surprises
for those acquainted with the local scene.
Norma Redpath’s three large bronzes
support her growing international repu-
tations. She moulds a form much as a
visionary architect sculpts a building and
it is perhaps not a coincidence that
several portions of “Horse Bird and Sun”
could easily have been inspired by
Wright’s Taliesen West. This enormously
organic yet tectonic sense is further evi-
dent in her treatment of surface that
constantly suggests layered shales and
other rock formations.
Clement Meadmore’s “Donlith III” is
the other really outstanding exhibit. A
sense of massive monumental complete-
ness is achieved with extraordinary
economy. One wonders why other less
inspired artists are better represented at
his expense.
Less orthodox media than bronze and
wood are being exploited by Inge King,
Max Lyle and Robert Klippel.
King welds large sheets of steel into
stark angular forms which reveal a cer-
tain immaturity. Some juxtapositions are
awkward and the attempt to introduce


textural variety is very arbitrary. It would
appear that while her ideas are dramatic,
her translation of them into mass is
weak.
These observations are less true of
Max Lyle. The form of “Fire Bird”
exudes a poetical freeness that is absent
in the more conventional Phoenix II
of 1962. If Lyle continues to trust his
own abilities, he could well become a
major voice in Australian sculpture.
Robert Klippel has already achieved
such a state. His welded junk construc-
tions are beautiful understatements free
from gaudy bombast. Klippel’s work is
totally abstracted—not only is it devoid
of natural origins both materially and
stylistically but it also ignores some of
the usual criteria for sculpture. For
example, it suggests sound and motion
to the viewer—the former a constant
clacking, the later a disjointed frustrated
flaying. One hopes his effort will soon
have wider recognition.
Despite the paucity of practitioners,
and even with this amount of talent in
Australia, sculpture should soon excite
more interest. Moreover, it would also
be probable that, as time passes, more
artists will leave the safety of current
popular British modes and venture forth
on their own paths. When this occurs
this “Recent Australian Sculpture” show
may be deemed a moving force in the
revolt.

Science-fiction Morality
Night of the Auk. Arch Oboler. Union
Theatre, Melbourne.
Was “Night of the Auk” worth bringing
here? Yes, because, with all its imper-
fections, it stimulates the thinking
faculties and is the reverse of dull.
It’s a curious piece; I would sum-
marise it as a science-fiction morality. A
group of five men is returning from the
first expedition to the moon, financed by
a business foundation. Their leader is
Lewis Rohnen, one of those fatal ego-
maniacs who have practically become
stock characters. From the ionosphere
he addresses the world, boasting that one
of his subordinates, by planting the
American flag on the satellite, a feat
which cost him his life, secured it for
Uncle Sam. This provokes an immediate
nuclear war which wipes out the race,
as well as the satellite base towards
which our doomed travellers are hurtling.
It turns out the man who perished on
the moon was killed through Rohnen’s
greedy machinations. When the others
discover this, he suicides. An earlier
victim of his stupidity is young Lt Kep-
hart, an intense, father-fixated crew
member who dreams of abstract justice.
Colonel Russell stands for the abiding
manly virtues, Lt Hartman for youthful
hope and humor, and Dr Bruner for the

human conscience. Too neatly arranged,
perhaps, but this happens in moralities.
Here is an anti-war play that turns
its message (“It is easier to hate than
to think”) into viable drama. The near-
poetic diction becomes acceptable only
after a while, but by then the action has
got a hold. It is backed up by Anne
Fraser's set, which, though it looks
impossibly acrobatic, works breath-
takingly well at moments of climax, as
when the craft almost rams a burned-out
Soviet space-ship. Oboler’s ideas are
important and timely, characterisation
apt though not original, and the con-
struction as taut as it could be.
There are no weak links in the cast.

FILMS
Comic Greed
It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World.
Director, Stanley Kramer. Plaza Theatre,
Sydney.
A Sordid Affair (Un Maledetto Imbroglio).
Director, Pietro Germi. King’s Cross
Metro Theatre, Sydney.
Stanley Kramer is an intensely serious
film - maker “committed”, to use
the accepted (and no doubt Stanley
Kramer's favorite) expression.
This is not to say that he is solemn,
humorless, dull. He chooses subjects of
importance and immediacy “The
Men'’, “The Defiant Ones”, “On The
Beach” and treats them with intelli-
gence and vitality.
Now he's decided to move into the
field of the big slapstick comedy. Unfor-
tunately Kramer is not equipped for it;
with all his wit and talent, he lacks the
touch of frivolity necessary in a comedy
director.
I suppose the theme of the film is
serious a study of the effects of
greed. A group of quite ordinary people
are present when an escaping crook is
accidentally killed, and hear his last
words, telling where his loot is concealed.
They decide to find it and share it, but
unable to agree on a fair division of the
spoils, spend the rest of this interminable
film trying to outwit each other.
Broad comedy can, of course, be
effectively used to make a serious point,
“Dr Strangelove” being the classic
example. But the trouble is that Kramer
is not a funny man. He equates comedy
with noise and violence. He loves to
see people hitting each other, yelling
at each other, destroying things. Above
all, he is enchanted by the comedy inher-
ent in the destruction of cars cars
out of control, cars running off the road
(preferably, down cliffs or into rivers),
best of all, cars turning over.
The comedy of destruction can be
very funny indeed, but “It's A Mad,
Mad . . . etc.” has none of the topsy-
turvy logic of the Marx Brothers or
Laurel and Hardy films. It’s rather sad
to see the elephantine enthusiasm with
which Kramer pounces on some whiskery
old gag as if it were a new discovery.
He even has a man running through a
wall and leaving a hole in the shape of his
own silhouette. Even Bugs Bunny gave
that one away years ago.
The Cinerama process has certainly
improved to the extent that the seams
have been eliminated and a moving shot
no longer makes the image waver in the
earlier seasick manner. But there is still
distortion at the sides of the screen,
where the players’ faces become as long
as my own was as I watched them.
There's a mammoth cast of big-name
players, some of whom only appear
momentarily, giving the audience the
opportunity to play Spot-the-Stars.
(“Around The World In 80 Days” was
much more fun, however). Some of the
actors manage to rise above their mater-
ial notably Ethel Merman, Jim
Backus and Milton Berle - but most
of them seem to give up the struggle.
Pietro Germi’s film “A Sordid Affair”
takes a long time to get off the ground;
for about a third of its running time
this story of a murder investigation is
workman like but unoriginal. But, as the
police uncover the squalid secrets in
the lives of an outwardly respectable
group of people, the film comes to life,
and Germi’s direction becomes more
forceful and imaginative. Still it’s hard
to recognise the hand of the maker of
“Divorce Italian Style” or “D
Ferroviere”. It is extremely well acted
throughout.

BOOKS
Darkness at Sarsaparilla
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Burnt Ones. Patrick White. Eyre and
Spottiswoode. 265. 6d.
Mr White’s new book of stories has had
a rather mixed reception abroad, and it
may be that his international reputation
is now slightly past its peak. The three
years that have passed since the publica-
tion of his last novel “Riders in the
Chariot” have seen no flagging of crea-
tive energy: several plays, as well as
shorter works published in magazines,
have flowed from his pen. Yet his plays
have, perhaps significantly, not been pro-
duced in London or New York, and his
short stories have added little to his repu-
tation in Europe.
“The Burnt Ones”, then, appears in a
creative watershed, its level higher than
that of the plays and below that of the
novels. Several items in the book would
have been better extended into the
novella form, notably those set in Greece,
which have a rather denser and more
closely-worked texture than those set in
Australia. With the exception of one very
beautiful love story in an Aegean setting,
the Greek stories impress either as frag-
ments only, or as compressed longer
works.
Whether looking at the Mediterranean
or the Pacific littoral, Mr White remains
uncompromisingly honest to his vision.
It is one of the most striking features of
his work that unlike so many compatriot
writers he is utterly without optimism,
the egalitarian spirit or love of the com-
mon people. He has, absurdly, been com-
pared with Zola and Tolstoy: a compari-
son with Montherlant or Celine would be
far more apt. Celine most of all, perhaps:
the world of “Journey to the End of the
Night” with its ghastly load of humanity
bound for the coast of Africa, even sur-
passes Mr White's in its evilness. But the
quality of disgust is precisely identical:
the dwelling on physical ugliness of set-
ting and character, the obsessive recount-
ing of hopeless action and conversation,
the disdain for “ordinary” people in their
sufferings and aspirations. In Sarsaparilla,
that prototype of the Australian suburb
which is the focal point for Mr White's
anti-humanism, we might as well be in
Montherlant's Paris, Celine’s hell-ship,
Waugh’s Los Angeles, Camus’ Oran, or
Nathanael West's New York. White is
among the more extreme pessimist
writers of the century, with a streak of
black humor, icily sardonic and contemp-
tuous, that reminds one at times of
Genet.
TTHE European comparisons are inevit-
able, and Mr White is very much a
European writer. His mind is aristocratic,
aloof and malicious. For people who act
blindly, behave mechanically and speak
without thinking in a succession of pre-
dictable cliches, Mr White spares neither
pity nor kindness. Just such a creature
and we are among them every day of
our commuting lives appears in the
shape of the central character in “A
Cheery Soul” and as the mother in
“Clay”, to name only two examples in
this volume.
We should not perhaps complain be-
cause an author’s -vision does not fit our
own. The point is, that hating the com-
mon people for falling victim to gross
impulses, for being flawed through and
through with faults of greed and vulgar-
ity, he does not lie about that hate. Only
when as rarely happens he means
us to like his protagonist is there a falter-
ing of skill; even from his heroes he can-
not withdraw the charges that weigh
down the rest.
Anthea Scudamore, the central figure
in the long story “Dead Roses” which
opens the volume, is a creature flawed
not so much by her own observed faults
as by the author's cool attitude towards
her. Her story she marries a sexually
inadequate man, loses him in death, and
goes to Greece where she meets her
former lover, now married to an Ameri-
can woman is one which would, re-
tailed in some life situation, evoke in us
a warm sympathy. Yet from the first, Mr
White is unable to resist a sly dig at the
character’s expense, showing her thinking
silly thoughts about happiness and the
intellect at the very moment we are intro-
duced to her. From then on, our interest
in her plight is reduced; the scales have
been weighed too heavily against her.
“Willy Wagtails in Moonlight” is again
spoilt by an obvious and rather vulgar
mockery of character. The story is pure
farce: a tape recording of birdsong,
eagerly played in a suburban house,
erupts with dire unpredictability into the
cries of a silly woman being made love to.
This is very funny, spiteful and ingenious,
but good farce depends on its audience
ffeeling at least a shred of sympathy for
those involved. Here, Mr White's dislike
of all concerned leaves one simply shrug-
ging. And another story, “Down at the
Dump*’, reminiscent at times of “The
Lower Depths”, its characters brought
together in a setting of unqualified
squalor, suffers again from a substitution
of disgust for a more proper tragic irony.
“Clay” is perhaps the most technically
and aesthetically accomplished story in
the book. As in “Dead Roses'’ there is
the feeling of a novel-length narrative

squeezed rather uncomfortably but not
fatally into a small compass, but here
the writing is brilliantly alive and
sure. The story definitively analyses the
suburban world on which Mr White’s eye
so painlully turns, and the attitudes to
misfits which darken that world: Clay—■
like Alt Dubbo in “Riders in the Chariot”
-is '‘different”, not physically strong,
sensitive, misunderstood, the antithesis of
the all-Australian boy. He alarms his
mother w ith his “freakish” fantasies, then
marries to her relief and settles down to
a life of drudgery as a clerk. Here all is
masterly: the description of the city, the
father’s death, the blind, absurd mother
with hei unpunctuated Joycean speech
formidably relaying cliches, the boy’s
mad, terrible obsessions “Clay” cer-
tainly represents Mr White at the height
of his powers. But even here there is a
serious flaw: Clay, in the direct literary
tradition of the Divine Fool, of the
“Idiot” whom none can understand, must
surely evoke our sympathy or fail. And,
by a hair’s breadth, he does not evoke
that sympathy.
But if Clay himself fails to work, the
rest of the story triumphantly succeeds.
Sydney comes brilliantly alive in it; the
city, one suspects, is Mr White's hidden
passion. He has, here and elsewhere,
fixed it in the world of imaginative
literature as firmly as Fuentes’ Mexico
or Isherwood’s Berlin. In the descriptions
of place these stories are unquestionably
those of a master. But one looks forward
to seeing Mr White’s black vision ex-
tended more fully in his next novel.
Best-selling Bonanzas
For the Christmas season, the majority
of bookstores are agreed that the leading
fiction sellers will be Leon Uris’ Arma-
geddon and Gore Vidal’s Julian, while
general literature will be considerably
more varied with Vincent Cronin’s
Louis XIV and A. T. Bolton’s edition of
Walkabout Australia among the leaders.
For juvenile reading, Dr Seuss’ Sleep
Book and John Burningham’s ABC are
domestic favorites and Elisabeth Mac-
Intyre’s Katherine and Ambrose books
for overseas gifts.
The best-seller business began in 1895
but really got under way only 2 years
later with Charles M. Sheldon’s book
In His Steps which has sold over a tidy
8 million copies. Runners-up in these
astronomic sales are Margaret Mitchell’s
Gone With the Wind and Dale Carnegie’s
How to Win Friends.
With the advent of paperbacks Dr
Benjamin Spock's “how-to” book, Baby
and Child Care leads the field with a
whopping ten-million sales. A random
look over the last sixty years of best-
sellers gives a revealing indication of the
public’s change of taste. In 1902, Owen
Wister’s The Virginian was top reading
with Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the
Baskervilles slinking along in seventh
place.
What subjects sell? The Bible and
religious subjects are foremost, cookery
books come next (which shows that the
care and feeding of readers is almost
as important as their faith) and detection
and mystery are third. Juvenile and teen-
age books follow.
A cursory glance at the current non-
fiction top sellers in the USA gives not
only a clue but a corroboration of one
sure way for a non-fiction book to hit
the best-seller list: it must be by or
about a famous personality. The fiction
best-seller group is more elusive: there’s
an old saw in the USA that anything
about “sex and the south is sure to
sell”. But sex is certainly not the sole
ingredient to a best-selling book; it needs
a sub-theme. Catholicism always com-
mands a wide public as de Lampedusa’s
The Leopard and Morris West’s Shoes of
the Fisherman successfully illustrate. Sex
and violence make a loving couple
(Fleming, Mickey Spillane). Man-
against-the-elements, with or without
sex, apparently appeals irresistibly to the
arm-chair reader (Wouk’s The Caine
Mutiny, Monsarrat’s The Cruel Sea,
James Ramsay Ullman’s The White
Tower). Animal stories, fiction or non-
fiction, go over excellently, if not at the
top of the best-seller list, at least making
up in endurance what they miss in
first place. The Incredible Journey be-
came a Disney film and Ring of Bright
Wafer started a whole spate of otter
stories. Medicine, too, can “go” but the
doctor must be young and idealistic,
A. J. Cronin cornered this field for years.
How are manuscripts found and pro-
moted? Ninety-five per cent of pub-
lishers will not read an unsolicited manu-
script except under pressing or personal
circumstances. The literary agent’s prime
job is to feed the publisher material
already judged worthy of print. A new
author’s first hurdle is to get an agent
to handle his work and agents are of
necessity very choosy what they take on.
In return for a percentage—usually 10
to 15—of the author’s gross earnings, the
agent acts as his business manager.
Large publishing houses have stan-
dard contracts subject to amendments
and riders, which is where the agent
comes in. Contracts stipulate the ad-
vance an author may receive on a book,
the royalties agreed upon, the percent-
age of sales to be spent on advertising
(all, save established authors, can recon-
cile themselves to a minuscule percent-
age or none at all until and unless their
book starts to sell well) and varying
arrangements to be mutually agreed
upon with regard to film, drama, re-
print, paperback, television rights, an-
thologies, reprints and a host more.
Once a publisher takes on a book he
believes will sell—usually because the
author has a selling record behind him,
or a selling name —he promotes the book
by pre-publication propaganda.
Famous people who enter the book-
game from other fields can often self-
advertise by using their own medium,
like Jack Paar placing his own book
conspicuously before the camera during
his TV show, or alluding to it. Running
ads in either newspapers or magazines
is generally conceded to be a sop to an
author’s vanity without any real pull
behind such advertising.
Publishers’ instincts for new talent are
a subject of constant controversy. One
editor in a prominent New York pub-
lishing house waded through scripts sent
in for a non-fiction contest and was able
to see that book with a Brooklyn setting,
cut down to a quarter of its length and
presented in fiction form, would make
a best-seller. This became Betty Smith’s
A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Another
publisher recognised American suburbia
in the mess of Peyton Place and prompt-
ly tried to repeat this success by getting
Grace Metalious to write a sequel,
Return to Peyton Place, which sold in-
differently. It scarcely needs adding
that best-sellers are neither necessarily
great nor even good or lasting books.

If you stop to think about it, nearly half
the children's books or stories all over the
world are about animals who can talk
with human children, particularly in the
realm of legend and fairy-tale. It is
natural therefore that some early Aus-
tralian stories for children that will live
on should also be about animals.
“Snugglepot and Cuddlepie”, written
and illustrated by May Gibbs, a series
first issued in separate volumes, is gath-
ered up as “The Complete Adventures
of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie”. These
Gum Nut babies come from the honey-
scented flowering gums like the blood-
wood, whose nuts form after flowering.
They have hair-raising escapes from the
wicked Banksia-men (covered with a
prickly-looking growth). The fat naked
little Gum Nuts and feminine Blossoms
wearing the creamy stamens of the
flowers as ballerina skirts, appear on
every page, natural to the country and
without explanation. When Snugglepot
and Cuddlepie run away they send letters
home by bird-post. There are Kangaroos
and Nuts playing cricket: Gum Nuts in
a football scrum—fat behinds well to
the fore-—a Kangaroo race; Sea-dragons
(Sea-horses really) under the sea with
Obelia patting them, or Gumnut and
Ragged Blossom racing home on them.
After Mr Nut has rescued Cuddlepie
from the bad Banksia-men carrying him
home, there was Mr Lizard relaxing in
a curvy easy chair with a pipe. Mr Nut
began to make cakes using the Sun's heat
for an oven, as all Nuts do. Cuddlepie
wants to help, so w ; as given some honey
and dew to mix; the picture show's him
sitting fatly on the floor w'ith his mixing
bowl. Mr Nut has some Serve Ants to
help him. They think Obelia might turn
into a “Lish Lolk” under the sea. “Can't
the Lish Lolk come out?’’ asks Mr Lizard.
“Goodness no, they'd dry.” “Go deadi-
bones?” says Mr Lizard. “Quite,” says
Snugglepot, who thought of going down
to fetch her up. “I'll come too,” roars
Mr Lizard, smacking his tail and picking
a spray of native rose to flip the fiies
off with.
The pictures, like the story, are en-
tirely original.
“The Little Black Princess,” by Mrs
Aeneas Gunn, was first published in Lon-
don; the latest edition issued by Angus
& Robertson with the original photos
and drawings, in 1961. The endearing
little mischief Bett-Bett, who became one
of Mrs Gunn's domestic helpers at the
homestead in the Northern Territory,
taught her hostess a great deal about the
native people, Bett-Bett and the lubras
turned all work into a laughter-making
game. There was Washing Day: “And
we were all delighted and so would you
if you'd been there.” Breakfast at sun-
rise, and immediately after, a wild
scramble among the bundles of soiled
clothes followed by a race to the billa-
bong, “Bett-Bett last with the stocking
bag”, and her pup Sue. At the creek
each one dropped her bundle, stripped,
and took a header into the water. Their
mistress on the bank joined in the fun by
throwing big pieces of soap after them,
for which they all dived wildly with
shrieks of laughter. “Wash the clothes
very clean today,” she says. “You eye
Missus,” they shout back as Bett-Bett and
another had a tug-of-war with a sheet.
The six lubras then sat on the bough of
a tree soaping the clothes which they
rolled into balls, then pelted each other
with them. There is the blackfellow who,
finding his trousers too hot —“him bite
me longa knee”, took them off to work
in the garden, and wore them fixed to
his belt, dangling in front of him. As for
the Coronation Playabout for Edward
VII, it must be read in full. Mixed with
such entertainment are native legends and
social customs, preparations for a Debbil-
Debbil dance.
Neither this nor Ethel Turner's “Seven
Little Australians" ever seems to have
been out of print. The latter has so
much action, so many escapades among
a family of high-spirited children that
its excitement never palls, in spite of a
faint aura of the class-consciousness of
the 'nineties. Harsh the father may be
towards his seven resourceful children,
but fathers were, and can still be, harsh;
there is a standard of behavior taken for
granted, and if an unhappy little boy is
whipped for telling lies or trying to
wriggle out of a situation through fear,
though the others may sympathise and
try to “beg him off", they know he was
wrong. And Judy, sent to boarding-
school and not allowed home for the
holidays, Judy who ran away and walked
or got lifts to come home for one glorious
week, hidden in the stable loft. How
many children have shed tears over her
illness and the tragic end to the picnic
among ring-barked timber on the station
up-country! This story won't die be-
cause it is not sentimental, it is full of
action, and the family so devoted.

for children would be incomplete without
mentioning Norman Lindsay’s “Magic
Pudding”, with his own riotously funny
drawings which only he could do. Child-
ren and grown-ups alike can only laugh
with self-recognition as they read this
very Australian fantasy.

Wild Black Country
Our Stone Age Mystery. lon Idriess. Angus
and Robertson. 425.
It is not surprising that lon Idriess has
come to be regarded as a sensational
author with tendencies towards exaggera-
tion. Since the days when his only
writings were regular contributions to the
old Bulletin, he has written 43 books;
some like “Lasseter’s Last Ride”, written
because it appeared likely that they
would sell; some very sound and written
with a solid basis of knowledge gained
by painful experience in the times when
the knowledge was there to be picked up
first hand.
Anybody born among blackfellows—l
like the friendly word —and privileged to
have been their infant playfellow, sharing
with them the hunt for bees’ nests and
lizards, the dragging of billabongs for
yellow bellies and crays (“yabbies”) will
find “Our Stone Age Mystery” a refresh-
ing recapitulation of things once known
as of nature. Mr Idriess of necessity
has had recourse to the remote Westra-
lian tribes of the Leopolds and Kimber-
leys for his examples and illustrations.
When I was a boy the eastern border of
native semi-civilisation was round
Cooper’s Creek; of wild blacks, the
Northern Territory border in the Centre.
The wild black country began somewhere
out beyond Alice Springs, but within
reach of it, in the centre and at the level
of the Roper east of the OT Line in the
North. Now it is doubtful if anything is
left save for one or two desert tribes that
could be called by any stretch of imagi-
nation worse than semi-civilised. So one
can be grateful to Mr Idriess for pre-
serving a picture of the past and all that
it stood for, as a base from which to
view the problems of moulding the future
of the native race.
His ow'n trend of thought on develop-
ments to come seems a little nebulous,
but leans towards a commonsense policy
of ultimate integration of Aborigine
with white and the blending of the two
into part of the Australian race.
It is clear that the Aboriginal race can-
not be retained pure, preserved by
national charitable effort as a curiosity.
Blending has gone too far already.
Because of the nature of the Aborigine
and his ability to blend his blood with
that of white men repeatedly without
throwing back to original stock, however,
he does not present the dangers which
beset the blending of Negro blood with
white blood.
Many an Australian grazier of the out-
back has sent his native half-white sons
to public schools and never felt reason
to regret it. And though the white-Abo-
rigine combination may never produce
men like General MacArthur (who had
Indian blood in his veins) or some others
on a par among distinguished white-
colored Americans, there is no reason to
be afraid ultimately of integration. Noth-
ing is apt to make the friend of the Aus-
tralian black more annoyed than the
spectacle of men of good intent exhibi-
ting octoroons not distinguishable as
carrying black blood in them, on plat-
forms where they play Negroid airs on
Hawaiian guitars, and are held up as
examples of what the missions are doing
for the “Aboriginal”. Most of the half-
caste agitators who call themselves Abo-
rigines as they beg for “justice” for their
race, are looking backwards to a world
against which the gates are shut by pro-
gress. They should be looking forward to
racial unity.
Mr Idriess has something to say about
the mysterious origins of the Australian
Aborigines, about their legends and sym-
bolism, about the strange and advanced
drawings of faceless men first noted by
George Grey 124 years ago. But he
brings us no nearer to solution of the
problems associated with them than those
who have gone before. He is fishing in
an almost bottomless lake in which scraps
of evidence whirl about like leaves in a
whirlpool, but there is no connecting evi-
dence.

Time Stood Still
A Moment in Time. H. E. Bates. Michael
Joseph. 265. 6d.
Bates really does succeed in re-creating
in glowing capsule form those few
months in 1940 when France fell and the
Battle for Britain began, but he sees it all
through the eyes of a remarkably “short-
sighted” 19-year-old girl who lives with
her equally remarkable but “long-sighted”
grandmother in a coastal rural district
in southern England. Telescoped into a
few brief weeks comes the girl’s meeting
with and marriage to an RAF officer and
her speedy widowhood.
The atmosphere of those days when
time really did seem to stand still and
when the golden harvest in the fields
gave the lie to the rain of death from
the skies is vividly captured. “Flying
Officer X” Bates can clock up another
successful mission.
MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Nostalgic Acres
London Has a Garden. Clemence Dane.
Cassell. 38s. 6d.
Clemence Dane feels most at home in
the past. She loves people, but admits
that no gathering is ever quite complete
for her since in it she would like to
include Shakespeare, Baron Munchausen,
Solomon and the Recording Angel. She
has lived through five reigns, three major
British or World Wars, the transition
from horse-drawn vehicle to motor car,
from steam engine to aeroplane.
Her book is about Covent Garden, the
little area in the heart of London which
was once a monks’ graveyard. Though
entertainingly slight, it is a scholarly
book, full of those fragments of historical
information that sharpen the appetite for
a more substantial meal. The narrative
moves at a pleasantly leisurely pace,
wandering from one period to another as
Miss Dane introduces us in a delightfully
intimate way to the host of famous occu-
pants of the “Garden”. We meet writers,
singers, statesmen, dancers, actors and
actresses. These people make a story
in themselves and we might be satisfied
if that was all Miss Dane set out to
do. But she promises us a tale of
“country and town, commerce and
romance, art and cabbages, not to
speak of present and future”, and the
fact is we just don't get it. Lost in dalli-
ance with her two loves again, she pulls
herself up from time to time to throw
in some homely Market personality, but
mostly she sees only the most exotic
flowers and fruit on the stalls and the
odd cabbage leaf or humble spud seems
to have got there only by accident. Again,
she assures us that “everything that hap-
pens in big to the whole island seems to
have happened in miniature to the
Garden”, so we expect to get a picture
of Britain in her small mirror. By skim-
ming over the poverty, squalor and vice
of the 18th century which she sees chiefly
as material for the masterpieces of
Hogarth, Fielding, Dickens, and happily
disregarding the untidy, noisy and un-
lovely huddle that the Garden is now,
Miss Dane conveys a Britain sighing over
her past. This is not fair or true of a
nation which, better and more tranquilly
than most, has accepted and absorbed
change and made it solidly her own.

Vanity Cast Down
Lost Worlds. Leonard Cottrell. Elek.
£6 10s.
This is the Christmas book: a magnifi-
cently illustrated, ably written account of
the vanished civilisations: Mr Cottrell is
the doyen of popular historians of the
antique eras, and he writes with a quiet
but unmistakable relish about such
cheerful breakfast topics as the method
by which the Egyptians were interred
and their journey into the underworld or
the sacrificial rites of the Indian tribes
of Central and South America. Only Rose
Macaulay’s beautiful “Pleasure of Ruins”
can be said to surpass in eloquence this
monumental hymn to the tons of dead
stone that once marked the triumphs of
empires. But, unjustly, it is the pictures
that will sell the book, and that make it
a superb and indispensable possession:
from the brooding faces of Angkor to the
winged bulls of Assyria, from the gorge-
ous ornaments of the mysterious Tutank-
hamen to the marvelled terracotta sarco-
phagus of an Etruscan aristocrat at Cer-
veteri. Alas, of the Hanging Gardens and
the Tower of Babel at Babylon only dull
mounds remain. Sybaris, too, is so utterly
vanished that it can find no place even in
this volume. But perhaps it is better to
dream of their foundered beauty than to
look too long at the shattered head of
Pharaoh by the pyramid, or the tendrils
crawling over the faces in the jungles of
Indo-China.

Dutton’s Drysdale
Russell Drysdale. Geoffrey Dutton. Thames
and Hudson. £7 7s.
Most people get their art education from
books of reproductions. It accounts, I’m
sure, for a kind of Top 40 attitude. (“1
much prefer Degas to Monet”, etc.)
Personally I never went much on Rem-
brandt until I saw his self-portrait as an
old man in Melbourne’s gallery. Indeed
why not? I only knew him as a painter
in reproduction and to me he seemed to
inhabit a world bathed in golden syrup.
Fortunately a taste for Drysdale’s paint-
ing won’t depend on meeting him through
this book and it’s certain he’s no cocky’s
joy. He’s available at almost every
State Gallery so buyers of the volume
will be able to turn the pages remember-
ing gladly that his paintings don’t look
like that.
Continuing the idiocy of using over-
seas engravers to reproduce paintings
they have never seen, Thames and Hud-
son have made one slight improvement
over their Dobell book: there is not so
much reflection from the paintings repro-
duced in the color plates. Perhaps it’s
because they used more photographers.
Many of the color plates have not been
reproduced before and the black and
whites are excellent. There is a fascina-
hog tape-recorded interview and an ex-
cellent bibliography.
Geoffrey Dutton’s introduction with its
examinations of the “ ‘Real’ Australia
which so often wastes the time of all
concerned, but which nevertheless in ex-
pert hands are so necessary as a form of
national stock-taking”, is long winded
and self-contradictory. Having said that
it’s always a dangerous thing to try to
spot the influences in Drysdale, he then
proceeds to do just that. He compares
paintings to Degas, Bacon, Gaugin,
Moore and Sutherland. He is unpardon-
ably condescending when, having quoted
at length from Drysdale’s extremely arti-
culate writing on the Centre and what it’s
like to be there, he then proceeds to
paraphrase it. He talks of composition
“Mount White’’ and “Mother and
Child”—when he can only mean subject-
matter. It makes one wish for a book
made up of Dutton on the painter’s life
and Australia if he must, with the in-
terpretation of the artist’s philosophy left
to Drysdale’s own very moving and self-
explanatory writings.

No Wooden Horse
Phar Lap: The Story of the Big Horse.
I. R. Carter. Lansdowne. 28s. 6d.
Mrs I. R. Carter achieves novelty among
the pile of Christmas books on my table:
she has written the biography of a BIG
HORSE. Not the Wooden Horse of Troy
or one of troica horses of the Kremlin:
but the Big Horse, the pride of Austra-
lasia, an equine hero ranking with Ned
Kelly, Ben Hall and Governor Bligh in
the Australasian hall of fame. Need I
mention his name: Phar Lap.
It is a name that seems to have a Sans-
crit base and to mean Swift Horse, or
Lightning Horse or something of the sort.
Like a lot of other historical heroes his
male parentage seems a bit doubtful
even on Olympus that was bound to hap-
pen. But it did not prevent his deification,
for did not that High Priest of the Race
Track, the Venerable Jim Pike, primate
of the ten jockeys who rode him in 51
starts to win 37 firsts, three seconds and
two thirds and nearly £67,000, utter his
divine verdict: “Often I have heard what
a great wonder horse Phar Lap was. It’s
sacrilege, really, to ride some horses after
once having been on the back of Phar
Lap.”
Phar Lap indeed was a prodigy among
horses and one can rejoice that the
school children of the future will have so
complete a record of the birth, upbring-
ing, importation, and career of this great
Australian, including details of the
tragedy which cut short a life so useful
to punters and so frustrating to the
bookies —the natural enemies of right-
thinking mankind.
It would take a Harry Messel with
two computers to find anything left out
of the details of Phar Lap's life, as set
out by I. R. Carter. Everything that he
ever did, every pup he befriended, every-
thing that any jockey, stableboy or critic
ever said about him is there if not in
words in portraiture Phar Lap with
Bob Parler, Jim Pike, Billy Elliott up;
Phar Lap “at left, Stan Boyden who
drove the float for him during most of
his Melbourne career”; Harry Telford,
bis trainer, “giving one of his rare
smiles”; and, alas, after he had con-
founded the talent of Agua Caliente in
America, the dreadful denouement that
proves that all horseflesh is at best prime
oats, represented by: “Louis Paul Jones
putting finishing touches to Phar Lap’s
life-like effigy”. This is supported by
pictures of Phar Lap’s skeleton and Phar
Lap's 141 b heart (with a triangular wed-
ding cake piece cut out of it) set for
comparison beside the puny six pound
pump of an army remount. It is all there,
detailed with commendable particularity
even to descriptions of the sad state of
his stomach walls and what the breakfast
food advertisements describe as his
“regularity” on his last day of life, for
those who wish to decide whether the
v/icked Americans poisoned him. To
quote the Oracle Mr Pike again: “There
couldn't be another horse like him, and
I don't care where you went to find him.”
And that is saying something. John Gals-
worthy once wrote to me that Nat Gould
Was “quite the worst writer in the world,
only redeemed by what he writes about,
horses, the which are the pink of crea-
tion.” And Mrs Carter writes better than
Nat.

Fishes of the Great Barrier Reef and Coastal Waters of Queensland.
Tom C. Marshall. Angus and Robertson. £lO 10s.
It must be nearly a decade since the ichthyological community
in Australia and abroad began to look forward to the produc-
tion of this book, but the wait has been worthwhile. If fluctu-
ating fortunes of the manuscript caused the delay then this
is a lively instance of the truism that you cannot keep excellent
work from publication. Nothing as comprehensive has been
published in this country.
The subject is, of course, inexhaustible; a hundred years
from now new varieties of fish will still be caught in Queens-
land waters, but Mr Marshall's work (a life work, for he was
until recently the Queensland Government ichthyologist) pro-
vides the most substantial basis yet for study and amplifica-
tion. The scope of the work is wider than the title suggests;
the area is perhaps the world's richest, and many of the
varieties described here are found in other oceans, tropical
and temperate.
This is an easy book for the layman. There are separate
indices of scientific and popular names and a glossary; and
classification principles are plainly set out, simple, and easy
to use. If I can judge the average layman by myself he would,
I think, have appreciated more discursive descriptions of habits
and habitats, something after the style of David Graham’s
“Treasury of New Zealand Fishes”. Mr Marshall is a little too
grudging with these, though it is true that if he had not been
his book would have reached enormous proportions.
Illustrations are excellent. No artist has yet consistently
caught the colors of fish in their true intensity. Anyone who
has watched within seconds of capture, the swift deterioration
of the blues and greens of a New Zealand blue cod, or the
air’s ravishment of a dorado’s cloth-of-gold, realises the diffi-
culty; and there are few fish which are not, in some lesser
degree, affected from the moment they leave their own element.
So the slow and patient work of the artist is expended on a
subject already lost; yet the artist, for many reasons, is better
than the photographer in color for this work, and the repro-
duced paintings of George Coates, of Townsville, are excel-
lent. Since there are so many it is inevitable that a few do
not come up to the quality of some of T. C. Roughley’s, in
his “Fish and Fisheries of Australia”. But they are faithful
works, and their range is impressive. Most convey the beauty
of the subject.
The physical presentation of this book matches the high
quality of its contents. The paper is a Burnie Special Offset;
on it, illustrations and type alike have a royal setting, and it
feels good. The gold-blocking on the case alone is a superior
work of art, and the binding promises that each copy will have
a satisfactory permanence, even if it is to be subjected to the
rough handling which institutional libraries sometimes cannot
avoid.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Psychological Restraint
I /~v verseas influences are having a dampening effect on
II the Australian economy even if only in the psycho-
, logical sense.
The increased bank rate in England, followed by a
round of similar increases elsewhere, has caused Austra-
lian businessmen to wonder if the interest rate structure
in Australia will rise still further, thus creating even dearer
money at a time when basic costs are being pushed higher
by a spiralling wage structure and a more competitive mar-
ket for available goods.
I With the overseas scramble for additional exports to
(counter the inevitable balance-of-payments problems, Aus-
tralian manufacturers are having greater pressure placed
upon them.
Meanwhile, Australia’s export earnings come under a
harsh spotlight. The need for other countries to solve
itheir balance-of-payments problems and to finance their
imports under a higher interest rate structure naturally
[tends to restrict any tendency to stockpile commodities
like wool.
Wool values dropped sharply when UK buyers withdrew
their support on news that bank rate had been raised in
the UK. Other buyers also tended to hold off in the hope
that prices would fall further. The implication from all
this is that Australia's export cheque will be lower in the
1964-65 financial year, at a time when Australia’s over-
seas reserves will need to be bolstered against heavy defence
'purchases.
At this stage it appears that wheat sales will continue to
)e buoyant—not because Australia has earned this posi-
ion but rather because of starvation in certain areas.
If on top of the current situation the Commonwealth
jovernment decides it is necessary to impose further
Restraints (to offset its accelerated defence and public
|vorks spending), the outlook is cautionary, to say the least.
Ilf overseas economies were booming and buyers were
lentiful for Australia’s exports, there could be real justi-
cation for credit restraints to contain an inflationary
oom. But overseas growth is tapering off in several areas.
[ The current situation in Australia is one of cost inflation,
aggravated by the need for heavy Government expenditure
a time when the labor situation is tight. Under these
ircumstances businessmen are inclined to curb any opti-
mistic plans for rapid expansion, unless specific circum-
' tances encourage them to do so.
Against this background it is obvious that the solidly
entrenched companies, whose assets were purchased at
cheaper monetary levels, must have an edge on those who
are attempting to break into the same manufacturing field
today.
A continued weakening of share market prices, therefore,
will be watched carefully by the shrewd investor who wants
to take advantage of the setback in sound industrials.
Even so, he must be prepared for further setbacks. It
is the old story where the investor is admonished to be
patient and not look for quick profits. If Britain manages
to convince the rest of the world that sterling is safe (by
putting her house in order), and if America continues its
record peace-time boom in 1965, there could be a resur-
gence of market activity in the early part of next year.
Saved by the Banks
'JU'ow that Britain has bolstered sterling by a 3,000 million
dollars loan from foreign central banks, everyone is
curious to see what policy the Wilson Government will
implement to stave off another crisis.
Britain has a breathing space to correct what is, after all,
a long-term trend in the balance of payments. The Labor
Government, forced to follow a banking policy to avoid
devaluation, is now in debt to those who want to maintain
a strong international currency.
The temporary measures of a 7 p.c. bank rate and a
15 p.c. imports tax are regarded rightly as stop-gaps. More
trouble will be encountered with trading partners if the
blanket 15 p.c. imports tax is maintained or if direct
export subsidies are introduced.
But it is clear that if Britain is to solve the existing
problem, she must consider some method of boosting ex-
ports. To do this it is being suggested that she will need
to introduce an export incentives tax which cannot be
classed as a subsidy. One of the popular methods used
in some countries is a turnover tax, to provide a concession
to exporters by remitting tax according to the volume of
exports.
There are many side issues, of course. For example,
Britain’s defence partners have been grumbling that the
current crisis will cause the UK to cut back on its defence
commitments.
The Wilson Government also has been embarrassed be-
cause it was forced to follow the bankers’ line—a situation
that was thrust upon it but which bore the reality of com-
monsense rather than adding to the crisis by adhering
strictly to Labor platforms. Yet there is grave discontent
within the Labor Party on the political assumption that
Labor was pressed into a corner by moneyed interests who
placed unnecessary pressure on sterling.
The unions are restive. Although they are willing to co-
operate with the Government in solving the present crisis,
they have shown they are impatient at the vague policies
so far outlined. They want a specific programme from

the Government which indicates what sacrifices will be
necessary.
Labor is hostile that the economic policy of the country
can be dominated by speculative raids on sterling. This
has already prompted fears that Labor supporters could be
pushed too far the other way into retaliatory socialistic
attitudes.
It would be unfair to expect the Labor Government to
solve its financial problems overnight. Some of its obvious
solutions (such as export subsidies) are against the rules
of GATT, while capital controls also would be unpopular
with its major trading partners.
Unless it shows within the breathing space of the next
three to six months that it has devised adequate remedies,
there undoubtedly will be another raid on sterling.
Export Action Needed
YUith quite a few sources already predicting a drop in
export income for the current 1964-65 year, it
should be distressing to discover that Australia is failing to
hold its share of a close and familiar market the South-
West Pacific. Two eager, übiquitous trade rivals in parti-
cular, Japan and West Germany, are steadily gaining pene-
tration, even throughout Papua-New Guinea.
The region comprising these two territories, the British
Solomon islands, the New Hebrides, Fiji and New Caledo-
nia has actually yielded Australia an increasing income
from trading over recent years. Yet Australia’s proportion
of a healthily expanding market continues to retreat.
Only 36.6 p.c. of the area’s total imports were pro-
vided by Australian exporters during 1962-63. Any
monetary uplift seems merely to mirror the market’s
natural growth and not a better export activity.
The countries concerned have largely been calling for
foodstuffs and consumer goods, in the quick supply of which
Australia might surely possess reasonable advantages. Our
expansive industrialists should also be keen to cultivate a
rising demand for capital equipment, building materials,
agricultural and automotive products.
Yet in the face of such opportunities, ground lost in
Papua represents a drop from 68.8 to 63.3 p.c. of the
available market between 1958 and 1963, in New Guinea
from 65.2 to 54.5 p.c. during the same period.
Each of the other areas
mentioned exhibits smaller,
though very perceptible falls.
All six countries combined
have a population totalling
about 2f million and an im-
ports bill now exceeding £75
million a year.
Thankfully, Australian ex-
porters will soon be unable to
excuse their relative neglect
of greater promotive effort. A
trade ship under the auspices
of Australian Export Promo-
tions will cover the territories
next May and June. AEP is
a non-profit body organised by
the Associated Chambers of
Manufactures and the Associ-
ated Chambers of Commerce.
In the interval, of course,
there’s nothing to prevent a
spot of action by individual
companies!

a moment or two to spare, I've got some great ideas for

Italian Trade Link
Sponsored by the Italian Government and including five
officials from the Ministry for Foreign Trade, a 31-
man trade mission arrived in Sydney last week to promote
Italian exports, notably machinery.
Trade between the two countries is improving, but Italy
is importing at a faster rate than she is exporting to Aus-
tralia, Dr P. Mazzarini, commercial counsellor, told The
Bulletin at a trade reception given by the Italian Chamber
of Commerce in Sydney.
Although the trade balance is about £.33m. in favor o
Australia, Italy is not interested in cutting imports because
she needs Australian products, particularly raw materials
such as wool, Dr Mazzarini claimed. Australia is recog-
nised by Italy as a very desirable trading partner because
of the solid and fast growing economy.
All this seems reasonable enough with a rapidly expand-
ing Italian population in Australia, a popular Italian fashion
trend in clothing items for both men and women, furnish-
ings, etc. But the trade mission is keen to promote
capital items like machinery, machine tools, textile equip-
ment, packing machinery, concrete pipe-making and brick-
making machines, road-building equipment, machines for
the confectionery, beer and wine industries, and, of course,
cars. In nearly all cases, however, agents are established
in Australia already.
Directorships Unlimited
Tn her attempt to capture two seats on the board of the
Australia Hotel (Sydney), the leader of a group of rebel
shareholders, Mrs Y. Rentoul, has not pulled any punches.
One old complaint against Australian directors in general,
the multiplicity of board positions held, has come in for
solid attack.
Collecting board memberships, even by men of consider-
able business ability and experience, is assuredly to be
deprecated if insufficient time can be spared for an indivi-
dual company’s affairs. The problem is acute enough in
Australia, for a recent survey of 240 NSW and Victorian
companies shows that nearly three-quarters of outside
directors in the survey sit on more than one board.
Another and important slant on the situation is contained
in the October issue of the sober Brisbane Stock Ex-
change Journal. Speaking
editorially, the Journal says:
“We often wonder if there
ever will be an underwriter or
promoter courageous enough
to launch a new company
whose board of directors will
comprise men selected purely
on their ability in the par-
ticular industry and not on
their ‘Who’s Who’ list of
directorships.”
This editorial had begun by
pointing out the well-attested
difficulty of a man “without
any previous directorships
being appointed to the board
of a listed public company in
Queensland”. More’s the pity. 1
wherever such a difficulty
occurs; and even more so in
a country crying out for
vigorous and fresh-minded ifl'
dustrial development.

Focus on the Capital Market
Trading banks the odd men out
rHE growth and sophistication of the
Australian capital market have been
at such a pace in recent years it is high
time we had a full survey of the position.
Not since the Royal Commission on
Banking in 1937 has a conspectus of this
ioarket been attempted. Nobody needs
reminding that the Commission’s report
is now extremely old hat.
We have, of course, had a lot of
essays on the subject since then, but
nothing on such a grand scale as those
[bow put together in book form by F. W.
Cheshire under the joint editorship of
R. R. Hirst and R. H. Wallace, two
economists at the University of Adelaide.
Appropriately enough, Cheshire re-
leased this book the day after it joined
hands with Wilke and Co. and Inter-
national Publishing Corporation, a move
'diich gives the firm its first channel of
access through a listed company to the
-kill facilities of the capital market, and
(one which should help to pave the way
for additional supplies of working capital
(urgently needed to facilitate its expansion.
| It is rather a pity space wasn’t found
|in this book to present the part played
by the trading banks in the capital
)uarket. This was a conscious omission,
(prompted by the availability of other
ip-to-date literature on this aspect. It
is partly atoned for by several of the
uthors weaving into their scripts on
)ther capital market institutions the
nter-related activities of the trading
Wiks. For rounding-off purposes it
would have been preferable to see some-
ling more specific on the trading banks,
Even, say, to the sacrifice of some of the
ihapter on the savings banks, which gets
ibout seventy of the 470 pages in the
ook, a disproportionate weight, perhaps.
.
Impart from this the book also suffers
i from being a collection of essays by a
tries of writers working independently,
jather than an integrated book. This
deficiency could have easily been over-
feme had the editors essayed a con-
fiding chapter, bringing together the
•'lain points from the various studies and
tempting some sort of synthesis. As
lis there is no easily discernible pattern
5 presenting the studies which, excellent
1 diough they are in themselves, leave no
' : fear impression of where the capital
1 market is heading. A round-up of points
°r the consideration of the monetary
uthorities, for instance, would have been
stremely useful. Plenty of these are
beaded through the texts.
Further, if, as the rather heady intro-
duction says, the emphasis has been put
on the structure and scope of the market,
rather than on a diagnosis of monetary
policy, the reader has to work out for
himself how all the parts fit into the jig-
saw. For that reason the book will
probably seem rather a jumble to the
general reader, if not to the money
market expert.
That said, this book is a notable effort.
It has been written mainly by Adelaide
University economists (M. R. Hill, of
the Reserve Bank, who contributes the
chapter on Housing Finance Institutions,
A. B. MELLOR
Professor J. Me B. Grant, of Tasmania,
on Life Assurance, General Insurance
and Private Superannuation Funds, and
Michael Schneider, of Monash Uni-
versity, on Trade Credits, are the excep-
tions). Yet its flavor is far less academic
than might have been expected. If
Adelaide can hardly be considered to be
one of the hubs of the capital market in
Australia, the studies have no trace of a
parochial approach. All the writers
clearly know what they are talking about
and have taken pains to get into the
market place itself to ferret out the facts
and sequences. So each of them has been
able to come up not only with a faithful
picture of his allotted segment, but also
with many searching comments on
specialised and general aspects of the
market.
No attempt has been made to make
this a Radcliffe-type report. Nonetheless
some very pertinent observations are
made on the outworkings of monetary
policy. For instance, on the 30/20 rule,
unlike his fellow economist Dr R. F.
Henderson (see The Bulletin, Decem-
ber 5), Professor Grant sees virtue in
the taxation concessions associated with
it. “Unless the rate of interest on Com-
monwealth bonds is going to be more
responsive to changes in market forces
in the future,” he says, “taxation induce-
ments may be essential for life office
support of investments in Commonwealth
securities.” After the last loan result
the authorities will probably keep to their
captive devices such as this for their dear
life. Indeed the book has some hints
on possible new ones.
"C'or example, Grant considers the gen-
■*" eral insurance companies are for-
tunate to have escaped the 30/20 legisla-
tion, whose severest impact (despite the
protests of the life assurance companies)
he thinks falls on privately administered
pension funds. It is rather ironical, he
says, “that as the 30/20 rule is likely to
widen the yield differential between
public authority bonds and other securi-
ties, the general insurance companies will
be encouraged to invest a smaller pro-
portion to their assets in public authority
securities.” This is a point for Mr Holt.
I see no reference in the book, though,
to the suggestion that hire-purchase com-
panies should also act as agents for the
Government and contribute a proportion
of their funds to the loans programme.
On the other hand, a very strong
chapter on hire-purchase institutions,
written by Neil Runcie, is full of other
ideas to bring them under closer control.
Most of these depend, however, on
whether the Commonwealth Government
could acquire the necessary powers.
Runcie dismisses the idea of the admini-
stration of the control of hire-pur-
chase terms by the Reserve Bank in
favor of the establishment of a National
Instalment Credit Commissioner. Until
something of the sort emerges, he thinks
the prospect is for a less effective
monetary policy than would otherwise
be achieved. That is right.
At the end of a first-class descriptive
piece on the functioning of the Stock
Exchanges and their general role in the
capital market, Professor R. L. Mathews
launches into a controversial discussion
on the question whether the Stock Ex-
changes should be more strictly con-
trolled. He comes out on the side of the
angels. Despite their strong sense of
tradition, he says, the Australian Stock
Exchanges “have shown an agreeable
readiness to adapt their procedures to
the changing needs of institutional
finance”. So he considers “it may be


that regulation of the securities markets
and of company activities in Australia
can be more effectively undertaken
within the framework of existing institu-
tions than by establishing agencies along
the lines of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission”. This, of
course, is straight in line with the Stock
Exchanges’ own views recently expressed
by Mr A. B. Mellor, the Melbourne
Stock Exchange chairman.
The key role played by savings banks
deposits in the provision of Government
loan and private housing finance is recog-
nised in several places In the book and
the chapter on savings banks scouts
possible additional courses open to the
authorities should these become less
attractive to investors. There was a sharp
falling-off of the rate of increase in
savings bank deposits in October, so it
may be time for the authorities to be
thinking about some of them.
It is extremely unlikely, Wallace says,
that the increase in deposits will continue
at the rate experienced in 1962-63, since
in part this is due not so much to a
positive reappraisal of the virtues of
savings deposits, as to a reaction to the
alternative investments and a reduction
in the new issues of the private sector. It
would, however, be worth the effort to
try to maintain and expand the public’s
patronage of the savings banks by in-
creasing the rate of return on deposits.
This could be done in various ways.
Probably the book’s most skilful ex-
position comes from Hirst in bringing
us right up to date on the official short-
term money market, tracing the story
from the beginning, with flashbacks to
the less-sophisticated days when buy-back
arrangements were a lone and unofficial
substitute for what has since become and
will, hopefully, become increasingly
more so, a potent instrument in monetary
policy. He looks forward to a widening
of the eligible securities available to the
market on now generally accepted lines.
Although it stops short of discussing
the Government's two latest measures to
facilitate housing finance (the £250 sub-
sidy and the Housing Loans Insurance
Corporation), a most useful chapter is
provided on housing (covering the whole
structure of private and Government
finance in this field) by M. R. Hill of
the Reserve Bank. For the first time, to
my knowledge, we also have an excel-
lent survey of the provision of finance
for farming, specially related to the
activities of the pastoral companies.
Finally, something quite new, an attempt
is made to assess the significance of trade
credits in Australian business, a subject
worth returning to on some future
occasion. By that time, however, most
readers of The Bulletin’s business
section should have a copy of the book
themselves.
CROESUS
Treading on Overseas Toes
National interest and foreign capital
countries have attracted such a
A spate of private overseas investment
as Australia in the last five years. So it
is fitting that the Stock Exchange of Mel-
bourne should have invited a distin-
guished representation of overseas invest-
ment experts to join with investment and
political leaders here in a symposium next
February to discuss the general subject of
“Investment in Australia”.
It could perhaps have been expected
that this would not be made an occasion
to argue whether overseas investment is
good for Australia, a subject on which
there are a range of opinions in the com-
munity, but more one to listen to what
overseas people think about Australia as
an investment proposition and, if you
like, to discuss possible improvements in
capital market machinery here and par-
ade the attractions
of our investment
climate.
However, in their
desire to get as
broad and compre-
hensive a coverage of
the subject as pos-
sible within the com-
pass of the three
days (February 17,
18 and 19) of the
symposium, the
sponsors look to
have fallen into a
trap by mixing hot,
controversial local
issues in a pro-
gramme on which
papers will be read by distinguished
overseas speakers from the countries
providing most of the overseas capital
coming here.
For instance, is this the right occasion
to air our differences on the question
whether Australian industry and mining
is in danger of foreign domination? A
Cabinet Minister, Senator Gorton, is
down to read a paper on this subject.
Perhaps Senator Gorton can be relied
on to give the “right” impression to the
overseas visitors and send them back to
their various countries keener than ever
to invest here. My preference, however,
would be to have omitted this subject
altogether. Whatever the senator may
have to say about it, the discussion could
flare up awkwardly on a subject about
which public opinion here has not yet
crystallised one way or the other.
We don't want to pull the wool over
anybody's eyes, of course. Nor would
we have much chance of doing so with
G. K. FUNSTON
the guests down to present overseas views
on the question whether Australia is
attractive to overseas trade and invest-
ment. One, who will be giving the United
Kingdom view, is Michael Shanks, a top
London journalist now economic corres-
pondent of the “Sunday Times”. Another,
giving the US view, will be Mr G. Keith
Funston, currently president of the New
York Stock Exchange. The European
view will come from Dr Jur. Hans Wutke
from West Germany and the Japanese
from Mr H. Komuro, managing director
of Mitsui and Co. Australia Pty Ltd.
With so much heat being generated by
defence, overseas investment failed to
arouse any worth speaking about in the
Senate election campaign. Nonetheless it
is still smouldering below the surface. A
group of Labor Senators reminded us
of this on the Labor
Hour in Melbourne
recently and Mr
Holt was jolted
about it at a busi-
nessmen’s lunch in
Perth last week.
In answer to a
question, Mr Holt
took a point from
The Bulletin, say-
ing that critics of
overseas investment
overlooked the fact
that Australia al-
ready had an equity
of at least 40 p.c. in
profits of overseas
companies through
company taxation, not to speak of the
15 p.c. withholding tax on dividend re-
mittances. This is a much better way of
sharing the equity in their companies
than obliging foreigners to sell part of it
to Australian investors or for the Govern-
ment to acquire shares through a
national trust as recently advocated by
Mr Whitlam (see Croesus, September 12).
A much more useful series of sug-
gestions from the Labor side has recently
come from the Federal executive of the
Australian Council of Salaried and Pro-
fessional Associations, which is emerging
as one of the more intelligent trade union
voices. Its list commands the more atten-
tion as it seems to be inspired by an
objective approach, being prefaced with
a tacit recognition of the contribution
which direct overseas investment has
made to economic growth, to the balance
of payments, to the level of domestic
capital formation and to improvements in
technology.

The executive presents a formidable
(list of aspects on which it considers the
Federal Government should take stock of
overseas investment in relation to the
national interest. We have heard some of
these before, such as that the Govern-
ment displays an indiscriminate enthusi-
asm for all types of foreign investment
irrespective of their special value or spe-
cific economic implications. About that
it’s possible to say that the Government
has recently been mending its ways but
still has a long way to go. Also mentioned
is the failure to restrict competition be-
tween State Governments to attract for-
eign investment in their own States, irres-
pective of its value to the economy as
a whole. There is certainly room for more
co-ordination in this direction, though
such competition is not necessarily un-
healthy.
lather old chestnuts include the question
of export franchises. Then, there are
unjustified tax and tariff concessions, es-
pecially the former when continued after
the establishment of profitable operations,
and the latter when granted “to overseas
jlrms who intentionally build unprofitable
‘plants as a means of securing monopolis-
tic control of the domestic market.”
Again, the executive is not satisfied with
the present degree of disclosure of opera-
ting results by subsidiaries of overseas
firms. Admittedly improvement in all
these directions is slow, but perceptible
nonetheless. There is no harm in re-
minding the Government that more is
'required.
The executive has also been looking
into the possibilities of making industry
less dependent on overseas technology.
It thinks the Government should investi-
gate “cheaper means of purchasing tech-
nology and managerial know-how over-
seas”. Looked at broadly, as one must
here, these seem desirable objectives.
More controversial is its pointing the
hone at the Government for its “failure
to deal with monopolistic and price rig-
ging conspiracies which occur throughout
'he Australian market”,
j The executive thinks this failure, coup-
led with its other points on the inade-
quacy of our surveillance of overseas
investment, “enables United States firms
}o earn profit rates in Australia far in
Icxcess of their domestic rates or of the
yates earned by the United States in
fther countries”.
1 At least Mr Snedden is still struggling
|°n, even if nobody on the Labor side has
shown much enthusiasm for his proposed
legislation on restrictive practices to date.
More positive than all this, the execu-
tive suggests the Government should de-
mand equity participation in return for
subsidies to overseas firms engaged in “oil
parch and similar activities”. This idea
•eems worth exploring further.


The Making of Many Books
Australian publishers watch takeovers
fTh-iE recent Odhams-Wilke takeover of
Melbourne publisher F. W. Cheshire
has met with mixed reactions in Aus-
tralian publishing circles. Odhams, of
UK, and Wilke, of Melbourne, paid
£847,000 in the move, which gives them
both publishing and retailing facilities.
The deal thins the ranks of wholly-
owned Australian publishers. Wilke re-
cently acquired Brisbane's Jacaranda
Press and Cheshire itself absorbed Mel-
bourne’s Lansdowne Press not so long
ago. Now all these are to come under the
watchful eye of Cecil King’s powerful
Odhams empire. All these changes mean
that wholly Australian-owned publishers
can now be counted on the fingers of two
hands.
Even the biggest local publisher, Angus
and Robertson, contains a British interest,
William Collins of Glasgow. The interest,
25 p.c., does not allow Collins any mana-
gerial rights.
Publishers The Bulletin spoke to felt
generally that the Wilke-Odhams take-
over would not harm Australian publish-
ing provided it did not remove or restrict
“the peculiarly Australian flavor” of
local publishing.
There was talk, too, of stemming a so-
called “American invasion” of Australia.
Most of this talk came from outside the
trade. Those actually in the business said
there was no need to worry about an
influx of American publishers. Some even
felt the Americans had left their run too
late, that to set up in Australia now
would mean starting from scratch.
“There’s hardly anyone left to take over,”
one executive said. “And most of the
publishers remaining want to stay purely
Australian.”
There were some rumors of an urgent
need for Cheshire’s to find capital. This
was apparently needed because the com-
pany had been extending 18 months
credit to schools. With so much capital
tied up in stock, a consequent shortage
of working capital is supposed to have
developed. A Cheshire spokesman denied
these rumors but admitted that a sale was
necessary to raise cash for financial com-
mitments outside the business. He em-
phasised that the sale was not made for
the sake of the business itself. “The move
was made after a long period of nego-
tiation and we felt there was no sense in
holding things up until our fortieth
birthday in March.”
On the “American invasion”, the
spokesman said that, although moves be-
ing made by US publishers could not be
termed an invasion, “there is a certain
dangerous element in them.” The extent
of the influx would depend on whether or
not they were prepared to co-operate
with local firms. If they did, all would be
well. But bookselling profits would ob-
viously suffer from reduced margins on
their American lines.
“However, if the cut-throat tactics of
the American book trade are adopted,
then there could possibly be a time of
trouble and some dire consequences. Up
to date the most likely keynote will be
co-operation,” the spokesman added.
A publisher important on the local
scene and without foreign interests is
Ure Smith Pty Ltd. Managing director is
Mr Sam Ure Smith, who is also president
of the Australian Book Publishers’ As-
sociation. Mr Smith has just returned
from a 10-week world tour and said it
would be interesting to see “whether
Cheshire's would be able to retain their
indigenous Australian approach to pub-
lishing.
“Nevertheless, one has to look at the
growing interest in Australia of overseas
publishers. I don't think there will be a
great deal of actual American publishing
in Australia at first, though there will be
moves to arrange distribution of the
goods. The American business in Aus-
tralia at present is mainly educational
books. The American textbook, at the
tertiary level of education, goes down
well here. The only trouble is that they
are higher priced than the British. They
are trying to cut the price down. I hope
it doesn’t reach the cut-throat stage be-
cause it would mean there’d be no text-
books. And we can’t have, in a country
of this nature, educational books subsi-
dised by overseas governments.
“The American publishers are showing
a much stronger interest in the Australian
market, as I found when I was in the
US a couple of weeks ago. They are
beginning to take notice of the fact that,
per head of population, Australians and
New Zealanders are the greatest book
readers in the world.
“The Wilke-Odhams move will meani
greater co-operation in co-publishing in!
Australia. Until now there has been
little or no use made of Australian edi-
torial talent when a foreign book is sent
here for publishing. One instance I can
think of is a book on horses of the world
we were sent last year. It had sections
about horses in America, in Argentina,
the UK, Europe, in fact almost every
country but Australia. Now if we’d been
told, we could have easily prepared a
section of Australian horses, with photo-
graphs, and it would have sold much
better than it did. Proper co-publishing
means the use of Australian editorial
talents to alter books from overseas for
the Australian market.
“IT'he Wilke - Odhams deal will also
A mean a good thing for the Australian
author now that more capital is avail-
able to purchase manuscripts. It will
mean greater competition for his writings.-
The Australian author today has a better
chance of being published than he has
ever had.”
One leader in the Melbourne publish-
ing trade felt that the takeover was un-
desirable on many counts. First, because
“Odhams would speak louder than any-
one else—‘Daily Mirror’ companies all
have this characteristic. Secondly, it lS
completely ridiculous to believe that
Cheshire will go on as before without

“When I travel I don’t want to waste time.
I can’t afford to. That’s why I flew Pan Am
on my last trip.”
—says Mr. Clare Higson of Sydney, President, A.S.E.M. Export Association.
“I like to see my overseas customers,
then get right back home to my office.
I need an airline that flies everywhere—
without unnecessary changes of plane
and wasted time. An airline with world-
wide connections. Like Pan Am. I flew
49,000 miles with them on my last trip.”
As Mr. Higson found out, world-wide
connections make a world of difference
on a long business trip. Pan Am’s con-
venient schedule lets the busy executive
leave when he wants to, arrive when he
has to. The reason? Pan Am flies more

change. The main aim now must surely
be to make money and to keep food
flowing into Wilke’s publishing mouth.
You’ll find the firm catering more for the
mass market, I bet, and turning out color-
ful cookery books, etc. All this will be at
the expense of ideas books and books
with a truly Australian flavor. Of course
there are many ways to look at it, but
if one places any value on the nation
having its own publishers, controlling its
own publishers and publishing Australian-
flavored books then the move is undesir-
able and we have lost all this, plus a
wonderful little firm, to English control.”
In contrast to this a Melbourne book
authority said the takeover was “sad, but
not necessarily bad. I don't think Che-
shire's volume of quality production will
drop, so long as the present executives
keep their positions. When they go, the
shoe may be on the other foot. In the
meantime the firm’s good name will pro-
bably be maintained even though the
volume of mass-appeal books will pro-
bably increase. If and when the produc-
tion of quality books is reduced or com-
pletely stopped, I’m quite sure that one
of the other publishers, maybe Angus
and Robertson, will step in very smartly
to fill the gap. But don't forget that
while they retain the present respected
image, books on things like cookery
would probably sell all the better with the
valuable Cheshire name attached to
them.”

of Horwitz Publications Inc. Pty Ltd (“a

the Inc. after our name we’re American,
but we’re not, we’re wholly Australian”),
said if the Americans intended a mass
entry into the Australian publishing busi-
ness, they were making a late run. “They
are trying to recover a little bit of the
ground they have let slip.
“The long-term results of this takeover
in Melbourne will be interesting. Foreign
ownership is not necessary, per se, a
bad thing. It could have a stimulating
effect on publishing as long as Odhams
lets Cheshire continue to retain the in-
digenous Australian flavor of its pub-
lishing. It will not be worth their while
to stop it.”
Mr Horwitz said overseas competition
in general books was much more
noticeable than it was in educational
books. “There is little competition from
overseas in Australia for primary text-
books and for secondary education
books. The Australian publisher
has an advantage over foreign publishers
in these fields, as the books are written
solely for Australians.
“However, at the tertiary level there is
quite strong competition. On the edu-
cational side of the business there is a
high growth rate. This has been Hor-
witz’s biggest change in the last ten years
and the most successful.**
Horwitz is a keen book exporter, botf
of its educational and general books. 4i
big help on the general side of the busi-
ness has been the Carter Brown (written
by Australian Allan Yates) series, which
is now printed in 14 languages. “The
Australian publisher today, to publish
profitably, must export in one form oi
another. He can either sell rights, pub/
fish jointly with overseas firms, or expo]
books directly.
‘‘l don’t think it is sufficient to publish
for the Australian market alone. Somt.
times this means printing overseas. Asi
result of our Hong Kong branch, we ar>
now selling an Australian textbook tran*
lated into Chinese and printed in Honj ;
Kong. But I think the Australian indus /
try prints as little as possible outsid:
Australia.
“Publishing is probably the onl[i
secondary industry where there is m
tax or duty on the finished product, biife
there is a duty on the raw materials
If you bring in paper blank, unprinted,;
there is a duty on it, but if you bring 1?
in printed it is duty free. This is a ven
serious problem for Australian
The fact that materials and labor arp
cheaper overseas is almost an inducement
to Australian publishers to print over-
seas. This is not the solution, though,
because if we are to have a virile,
indigenous publishing industry we musl|
have printing and production facilities!
conveniently located.”
Mr G. A. Ferguson, a director I
Angus and Robertson, said he could se§:
no reason for the Cheshire image ti|
change with the introduction of Odhanis'/
capital. “But with the Odhanis’ finance!
they may do what they have been!
going to do a bit more quickly. It wil
change the rate of progress rather than/
the direction. It is better for
book publishers to be majority-owned!
from within Australia.
“In principle I think it would have
been a better thing for Cheshire’s to have
remained wholly Australian. This raises
the question of who is going to owni
Australian publishing—us or foreigners?!
“The British are very sensitive at thee
moment about American activity all over)
the world and this is probably one of the
reasons the deal was made so quickly- j
They are sensitive, too, about the grow-
ing competition in markets they have
regarded as traditionally theirs. Ameri-j
cans were rather late comers to the bcoAi
export market. It is only since the war,
that they have really begun to export.
“Their exports have been increased
by post-war literacy programmes and
most of their exports are educational
books. In the field of general or non-
educational books American export activ-
ity is not very strong because rights, not
the books, are disposed of to other
countries.”

Expansion with Price Rises
Manufacturers , and reserves, under pressure
T atest national income figures for the
September quarter, although show-
ing an increase of 8.5 p.c. in the gross
national product over the previous
quarter, nevertheless showed a decelera-
tion compared with the 10.3 p.c. increase
in the previous quarter.
Growth of the economy is still strong,
but if allowance is made for price in-
creases the real growth is more like 6 p.c.
Projecting this a little further and
giving credence to the fact that the in-
creased rate of imports will put pressure
on manufacturers as well as overseas
reserves, there is no justification for as-
suming that Australia has a boom on its
hands.
The overriding factor remains that
labor supply is still short and that Aus-
tralian industry must contend with in-
creased costs next year.
★ ★ ★
Oanks must still play a huge part in
Australia’s development and, with
the trend towards higher interest rates at
the moment, it is hard to go past them
when considering long-term investment.
Anyone in doubt about placing funds
at the moment could do worse than take
shelter in the banking section, despite
the prospect that the Reserve Bank could
squeeze harder.

ANZ Bank has indicated it does
not want to be left behind in the
commercial bills market.
It has formed ANZ Discounts Limited
in Melbourne. The Reserve Bank has
shown some reluctance to push an offi-
cial bills market at a time when the
Treasury has indicated it is anxious to
contain credit.
Nevertheless, it is worth keeping in
mind that the banks are in a strong
position to take advantage of this when
it does occur.

financial observers have been
telling investors to tread softly with
car distributors. The same applies to dis-
tributors of automotive components, but
to a lesser degree. A tightening of mar-

like the recent bids for Automotive
Components.

TQrylec Limited, distributor of Hoover
products and electrical appliances,
says it is likely to make a return of capi-
tal after it loses the Hoover franchise on
June 3 next.
Directors claim that, so far, no suit-
atffe avenue has been found for continued
employment of the company’s resources,
which could be construed in some quar-
ters as inviting a takeover offer.
The market values the ss. shares at
around Bs. and, with assets backing of
10s. 2d., someone could find this organ-
isation an attractive vehicle for a merger
of interests. But nothing spectacular
should be expected.

Echoes from the Recent Past
Resurrecting Stanhill Development Finance
The fate of Stanhill Development
Finance, the chief borrower of pub-
lic funds in the Korman group of com-
panies, is still a matter for substantial
speculation, even though shareholders
approved a scheme to resurrect the com-
pany at the recent annual meeting in
Melbourne.
The day before, it had been revealed
that the Attorney-General intended taking
the company to the Supreme Court in
order to have it forcibly wound-up on the
suggestion of the State Government’s
investigator, Mr Peter Murphy, QC. At
the meeting, directors pointed out to
shareholders that, once in court, the
company’s representative would have a
much stronger case to fight if they would
vote overwhelmingly for the scheme.
They got their vote after much carry-
ing on and went one step further than
they promised by writing to the Crown
Solicitor last week and asking him not
to proceed with the plans to wind the
group up. The letter pointed out that
this would avoid the dissipation of pub-
lic funds and added that any Court case
could mean lost money to the share-
holders, who had already voted over-
whelmingly to keep the company on its
feet.
It is unlikely, however, that the Crown
Solicitor will back down. Quite apart
from the condemnatory nature of Mr
Murphy’s report, it is believed in many
circles that, by winding the group up,
it will be much easier to get at a better
view of the Korman group’s past. On
the other hand, several critical observers
have put to The Bulletin the theory
that the likely result of any reconstruc-
tion scheme would be to avoid the prob-
ing of the Supreme Court rather than
giving shareholders a chance of recover-
ing their lost moneys.
Where and if any merit lies in either
of these arguments is not a matter to
discuss here. The fact remains that
shareholders cannot possibly be any
worse off than they are at present through
their acceptance of the scheme. Provi-
ding they don’t part with any more of
their money, of course.
It will be extremely interesting to see
what the receiver’s opinions are on the
scheme. These will be put forward when
the debenture holders, unsecured credi-
tors and note holders are asked to ap-
prove it. At the annual meeting he re-
mained quite non-commital and rightly
so. The position is vastly different for
these people as they stand to collect a
definite something if the wind-up goes
through. Supreme Court sanction is
finally necessary before the scheme can
be implemented and this, in turn, depends
on the approval of those people who are
to be guided by the receiver’s wise words.
Canny Gadsden
Although J. Gadsden Australia Ltd,
canister and packaging group, man-
aged to lift sales 13.5 p.c. for the first
four months of the current financial year,
it will be interesting to see the effect the
rise in the price of tinplate (which has
been relatively stable for some years) in
March, 1965, has on the next group
result.

shareholders at the annual meeting that
BHP, the sole tinplate supplier in Aus-
tralia, could not meet demand and the
company had been forced to import—a
move which would cost the industry
“many thousands of pounds”. He said
that, because the company was a con-
verter and not manufacturer of materials,
it was faced with increases which could
not always be passed on.
For instance, the price of kraft paper,
one of the company’s chief basic materi-
als, had increased twice during the past
six months. However, directors are opti-
mistic that the full year will show good
results. The knowledge of increasing
costs and tinplate shortages only tempers
their optimism.
The market took a rational view of
Gadsden’s position, marking the 10s.
shares down only Id. to 13s. sd. on the
announcement. There they yield 5.2 p.c.
on dividend and 9.6 p.c. on earnings.
Faith in CSR
oversubscription of CSR's £5 mil-
-*■ lion debenture issue is yet another
indication of investors’ faith in the com-
pany. Although the company indicated
it was willing to accept extra subscriptions
of £2 million, the market must have
given rise to genuine astonishment by
subscribing £l6 million.
The issue, which offered rates of
61 p.c. for five years and 7 p.c. for 10
and 15 years, opened and closed in the
one day. Applications for amounts up
to £5OO will be allotted in full, while
applications over this figure will be en-
titled to £5OO or 40 p.c. of the amount,
whichever is the greater.
The issue lifts CSR’s outstandings to
£9.8 million, of which only £200,000
matures in the current year.
Recovery and Record
Tt looks as though 1963-64 is to be the
A year in which the extensive British
Tobacco group makes its full recovery
from the setbacks suffered in 1960-61
and pushes consolidated profit past the
£2} million mark for the first time ever.
Last week it was announced that the
parent company’s profit for the year to
October 31 had reached a new high of
some £2,074,000. The consolidated re-
sults are not due out until early January.
If past years can be taken as any
sort of a guide, group profit will be well
in excess of £2i million. Last year, the
difference between the parent and con-
solidated results was around £474,000,
the year before that £352,000 and the


year before that £306,000. The difference
is obviously a growing one and the rate
of increase could be even bigger for
1963-64 if the wide expansion undertaken
in the year shows up to any marked
extent.
Such a result would represent the third
year of recovery since 1960-61. In that
year the group profit slipped badly from
£2,480,000 to £1,924,000 and necessi-
tated a cut in the long established 10 p.c.
dividend to 8 p.c. Recovery to £2,260,000
in 1961-62 enabled a 91 p.c. payout and
in 1962-63, with the £2,473,000 result
being only just below the profit level be-
fore the setback, dividend was completely
restored to those old familiar levels.
For 1963-64, payment is again to be
10 p.c., although the cover should be the
best for some time. Earning rate last year
was 12.6 p.c. about the same level as
existed in 1959-60. The dangers of such
a narrow cover have been well learnt
by shareholders, who had to take less
than 10 p.c. dividends in those two years
when earnings were 9.7 p.c. and 11.5 p.c.
respectively.
Odd Business
Tt is about time that something was done
to curb the carryings-on which the
directors of Sulphates seem to impose on
their shareholders so readily. Last April,
The Bulletin pointed out the folly of
their ways as regards dividend policy,
but latest developments surpass even this
and move into realms of complete dis-
regard for shareholders.
In the financial years ending in 1961,
1962 and 1963 losses were incurred, with
dividends being paid from reserves. In
fact, the payout in 1962 was lifted from
5 p.c. to 6 p.c. despite a heavier loss.
This policy cut reserves from £228,000 to
£90,000. An asset revaluation of free-
hold in 1962 resulted in an actual re-

ADDRESS BY TOE CHAIRMAN OF
OSTI HOLDINGS LIMITED
MR. F. W. THEEMAN
TO THE FIFTH ANNUAL GENERAL
MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
DECEMBER 4, 1964
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I welcome you to this, the fifth annual
general meeting of stockholders of Osti
Holdings Limited. You will all have
received and read the directors’ report,
so I would like to take this opportunity
of bringing you up-to-date on the cur-
rent trading position, and elaborating on
points made in the directors’ report
concerning the company’s basic strength.
Excluding the new subsidiary, which
was acquired in September, sales of the
group in the five months to November
30 are approximately 15 per cent higher
than in the corresponding period last
year. Taking into account the new sub-
sidiary, total outside sales were more
than 24 per cent higher. Due to the
vertical integration of member compan-
ies, a true assessment of the group’s
performance must include inter-com-
pany transactions, and I am pleased to
be able to tell you that on this basis,
the production picture is even brighter
still.
Profit figures to date are in line with
sales.
Forward orders, indicated and in hand
for the winter season, are greatly in
excess of those at this time last year.
To cope with increased production we
have added considerably to the number
of knitting, finishing and sewing mach-
ines in our factories. In addition, new
knitting plant, of the most modern kind,
will arrive from overseas early in the
New Year.
This plant is extremely versatile and
will enable the company to extend its
range of fabrics to include types at
present being imported, with a conse-
quent saving on foreign currency, and
to produce others which will be entirely
new to this country.
The significance of the new machinery
will become apparent when I tell you
that in the past five months we have
found it impossible to satisfy the demand
for garments made from newer-type
fabrics.
It is, of course, your board’s policy to
keep abreast of the very latest advances
in technology in our field overseas. To
do this our senior executives, including
myself, make regular trips abroad a
practice which is paying dividends in
the truest meaning of the word.
Further improvements have been made
in our standard costing and produc-
tion control systems and, although
budgeting has become easier by virtue
of greater forward sales, stock has
risen owing to the greater varieties of
yarn and fabric required to meet
increased production.
I would like to point out that barely
10 per cent of our total stock figure at
any moment consists of finished pro-
ducts, 90 per cent or more being raw
materials and work in progress. We have,
therefore, the great advantage that
stock write-downs due to fashion changes
are negligible, while price fluctuations
in raw materials in the synthetics field
are uncommon and rarely of major im-
portance.
I would also like to draw your atten-
tion to the fact that physical stock is
checked twice yearly under the supervi-
sion of independent auditors.
Our styling in both under and outer-
wear continues to enjoy ready accept-
ance and our thanks and appreciation
go to our director and chief designer,
Miss Dulcie Quin, and also to Mr. Eric
Strasser for their excellent work in this
important field.
In summary, your directors regard the
whole trading outlook as highly satis-
factory and are confident of bettering
the 1964 result in the current year.
There is no doubt that the funds we
have retained in the business as the
result of our acquisitions of tax losses,
have been a significant force in the
success of the group. Your directors
believe that the legislation recently en-
acted by the Federal Government in
regard to tax losses will not affect the
company’s future performance, as the
losses available will be fully utilised this
year and the continued rise in profits
which we foresee will more than offset
any additional tax.
I must emphasise once again that,
while in the public eye we appear purely
as a garment manufacturer, the bulk of
the company’s- resources is employed in
fabric production which, at the rate of
more than 5,000,000 square yards a year,
is sizeable even by overseas standards.
A further pointer to the advanced
technologies employed by our group is
That about half the output of our dyeing
and finishing plant represents work done
for other mills.
The directors would like to place on
record their thanks for the loyalty and
service given by the executive officers,
staff and employees over the past year.
For and on behalf of the Board,
FRANK WILLIAM THEEMAN
Chairman of Directors.
December 4, 1964.


HIGHLIGHTS FROM NATIONAL BANK
CHAIRMAN’S 1964 ADDRESS
Mr. J. A. Forrest, Melbourne—2s/11/1964
GOVERNMENT STABILIZES ECONOMY. Faced with possible inflation, the Government
is to be commended for having taken early action to dampen spending before boom
conditions appeared. Recent budget restraints have this objective, and the ratio of statu-
tory reserve deposits has been raised from 10.8% to 15.8%. But the very low interest
rates paid on these compulsory funds with the Reserve Bank means that banks and their
customers are meeting part of the cost of the monetary management of the economy. No
build up of inflationary pressure from excess purchasing is yet apparent, the June basic
wage decision undoubtedly being the prime factor in the recent upward drift of prices.
THOUGHTS ON MONETARY POLICY. A few years ago supervision of money and credit
through the banking system was thought to be sufficient, but greater attention is now paid
to ways in which money and savings outside this 'system are used, and the resultant ef-
fects on business activity. For example, spending can be increased without approaching
the banks by borrowing from financial intermediaries which, in turn, obtain funds from
public savings, normally bank deposits. The view now is that this kind of activity can
increase spending similarly to a rise in bank lending.
NEW PROBLEMS FACING THE BANKING SYSTEM. The new outlook has created new
problems and added further complications to the Reserve Bank’s onerous task of mone-
tary management. Anti-inflationary measures have led to restrictions being placed on
the banking system, and the vital trading bank section has been seriously affected. The
major trading banks now provide less than 30% of new lending each year after pro-
viding about 60% prior to 1940. Although partly a result of the development and matur-
ity of our financial system, this decline has been inordinately severe.
NEW IDEAS STILL UNDER DEBATE. Non-bank financial intermediaries perform useful
functions, and their overall effects on the economy are still subject to debate. This
year, a Canadian Royal Commission on Banking radically suggested that direct central
bank control should be extended far beyond the banking system. But only last year a
strong U.S. Government Committee on Banking said there was no real evidence for this
need in the U.S.A. This Committee wisely added that it could not pretend to have re-
solved the deep issues involved, and the forthcoming report of Australia’s own Commit-
tee of Economic Enquiry, with Dr. J. Vernon as Chairman, may well have something to
say on these matters.
BANKS’ UNIQUE ROLE IN STABLE GROWTH. The banking system still retains its
unique position because banks alone are repositories of money. Financial institutions or
other groups outside the banking system could not function without the services banks
provide. The banking system, led by the Reserve Bank, is also the major instrument (out-
side the budget) for steadying business activity. That at present the banking system is
almost wholly responsible for saving employment from spilling over into a boom may well
be no exaggeration. But to ensure a nationally responsible employment of the commun-
ity’s savings to the best advantage, trading bank lending in particular should progressively
play a much greater part.
ACCOUNTS. A record increase of £76m. brought consolidated balance sheet assets to
over £500m., to which the trading bank contributed £s4m. and the savings bank £22m.
Consolidated gross earnings at £15,221,000 were £1,406,000 higher than last year, and
expenses rose by £836,000. After increasing taxation provisions by £360,000 net profit
for the year increased by £209,000 to £1,457,000.
STAFF THANKED. The Bank’s staff in Australia and London was thanked for the very
high standard of service maintained over the past year.

serves figure of £317,000 in the 1963
balance sheet.
Having regard to this policy, it seemed
rather odd that the interim dividend was
omitted last April for the first time, des-
pite the fact that profits had at last re-
turned to the company during the half-
year to December 31. Directors said it
was necessary to conserve reserves a
necessity which should have been con-
sidered three years earlier.
The greatest surprise of all time arrived
recently with the news that 1963-64
ended up by producing a loss of some
£43,000. Of course no dividend will be
paid.
The reporting of a bigger loss than any
of the earlier ones (after it was known
that the first half had seen profits) is
surely a matter for serious protest. It
would also be interesting if one could
ascertain how much of the loss was
attributable to the fact that not enough
liquid capital was on hand to finance
business capital which would have
been available if dividends had not been
paid in earlier years.
The loss and the payment of a divi-
dend for the past year would have just
about wiped out unappropriated profits
completely, so there is actually no cash
available to pay another dividend even if
the company wanted to. If the directors’
policy was to pay dividends out of past
profits until the cash ran out, then this
should have been made clear to share-
holders earlier than now. The policy is
a misleading one to start with if it lacks
explanation. The position is still unclear
and it is only the facts of the case which
point so definitely to the existence of
such a policy.
Better Interest
TJire-purchase financier Custom Cre-
dit Corporation has offered attrac-
tive long-term rates on its latest £5 mil-
lion debenture and unsecured note
issue.
While the highest rate of 7 p.c. equals
the previous greatest return, it is for
debentures of five -years compared with
the previous term of seven years. The
latest issue offers £2 million in debentures
and £3 million in unsecured notes. No
oversubscriptions will be accepted.
On long-term notes the maximum in-
terest of 7 p.c. has been cut from a
term of five years to three years.
Shorter-term rates for both issues are
also increased. The money raised will
be used partly to redeem maturing de-
bentures and notes and to meet an in-
creasing demand for finance.
Barest of the Bare
Tt will indeed be a wondrous occasion
if the Melbourne-based car dealer, Re-
gent Motors, maintains its 12i p.c divi-
dend in the current year. Last week it
was revealed that the 1963-64 payout
had been lifted to this level from 10 p.c.,
despite the alarming fact that the year's
earning rate had taken a slide from 16.1
to 12.8 p.c.— providing the barest of
bare covers.
Moreover, the result is after a very
low tax provision, thanks to the past
losses of some subsidiaries. Whether these
will continue in the current year is un-
known, but they have to peter out some-
time. The seriousness of this situation is

fortunately offset to some extent by the
fact that, while tax has been almost
halved, depreciation has been almost
doubled, owing to the charges made for
the first time against some new premises
in South Melbourne.
This does not exonerate the effort
from its mediocre status by any means.
The optimists among us may decide that
the very existence of such a narrowly
covered dividend indicates that directors
are expecting bigger things this year.
However, in this case, it seems more
likely that payout has been made in an
effort to avoid hitting the shareholders

nounced a higher profit for the first half,
declared the bigger interim payment and
implied that all would be well for the
rest of the year.
Another Tin Miner
Yet another mining company is con-
A sidering working tin deposits. Latest
to join the ranks is Loloma (Fiji) Gold
Mines NL which sees tin deposits in
North Queensland as of “major import-
ance”.
Chairman Mr M. J. Cody in his report
accompanying the annual accounts ex-
pects production to start late in the cur-
rent financial year. He said although in-
vestigations into tin-bearing lode forma-
tions were long-range work the results to
date were encouraging.
Because of higher tin prices work is
being accelerated in the Atherton-Irvine-
bank district in the search and develop-
ment of ore bodies.
An Issue from ISAS
'EVrthmoving and construction equip-
ment distributor ISAS (NSW) Ltd
plans to raise additional capital with a
New Year share issue. Only details
directors will give is that it is to be
a one-for-four at par. The finance will
be used for the company’s development
plans and will raise paid capital from
£400,000 to £500,000.
Announcement of the issue was con-
tained in the interim report. There
directors said record sales had been
achieved and, consequently, profits had
improved. They have decided to pay
an interim dividend of 4 p.c., confirming
last year’s higher rate of 8 p.c.

CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to place before you
the Directors’ Report, Balance Sheet
and Accounts of the Company for the
year ended 30th June, 1964.
It is pleasing to report that con-
solidated net profit after tax for the
year was £842,936 compared with
£601,974 the previous year. This
resulted from increased sales, improv-
ed efficiencies, and from a much
lower charge for bad debts.
Depreciation charge is increased
from £399,407 in 1963 to £478,425
this year, this being a consequence of
the considerable amounts which we
have spent on new plant. The year’s
result partly reflects the benefits of
this expenditure which was mainly
financed by the issue of unsecured
notes including the 1973 and 1978
notes issued earlier this year.
In the Directors’ Report accompany-
ing the Balance Sheet, we drew at-
tention to the fact that we continued
to rationalize administration of the
group by liquidating non-operating
subsidiaries. Since 30th June, we have
pursued this policy and we believe
that lasting benefits will accrue from
the steps so taken.
You will notice from the Balance
Sheet that stocks on hand and in
transit were some three-quarters of
a million pounds lower than twelve
months earlier.
Being converters of other firms’
materials, chiefly kraft paper and tin-
plate, we are faced with increases that
cannot always be passed on, especial-
ly to those of our customers supplying
to the keenly competitive export
markets. Kraft paper has increased
twice during the last six months and
tinplate, whilst being stable for some
years, will increase in March, 1965.
We have additional concern as
BHP, who is the sole Australian sup-
plier of tinplate, cannot meet the cur-
rent demand, with the result that we
are urgently forced to purchase from
overseas at higher prices. This will
cost the industry many thousands of
pounds.
As sales for the first four months of
this year are 13.5% above last year
we are optimistic that the full year
will show beneficial results.
However, knowledge of increased
material and labour costs and short-
ages of tinplate somewhat temper our
optimism. Despite the higher profit
this year, your directors have decided
to adhere to the decision of strengthen-
ing reserves announced in April. Ac-
cordingly your directors recommend
payment of a final dividend of 4%,
making 7% for the year.
At the last Annual Meeting it was
reported that Australian Packaging
Industries Pty. Ltd., in which we have
a half share, was operating profitably.
I am pleased to report that their net
profit for the year ended 30th June,
1964, was £129,080. However, as it
is not defined as a subsidiary it is not
shown in the consolidated results.
We regret losing the services of
three of our Executive. Mr R. S.
Morton relinquished his position with
the Company after 32 years the
last 6f years as Managing Director.
We feel that the outstanding results
attained during the year must, to a
great extent, be accorded to his
endeavours.
Mr J. K. Ormsby, a Director and
Secretary of the Company for many
years, has just returned from an ex-
tended well-earned trip overseas. After
37 years with the Company,
Mr Ormsby retires at the end of the
year. His close association with Top
Executive of the Company will be
keenly missed.
Mr C. Sumsion, an Associate Direc-
tor, also retires from our Service.
The history of our Company will
record that he was mainly instrumental
in the initial production of high speed
Can manufacture.
We wish all three happiness, good
health and contentment in their retire-
ment and record our gratitude for the
loyal service which they gave over
the years.
To all our staff, we express our
sincere appreciation of their fine ef-
forts.
N. C. GADSDEN,
Chairman.

magnitude, the issue which directors are
planning for shareholders next year may
also entail a cut in the 14 p.c. dividend
rate. In 1963, the profit equalled 19.3 p.c.
on capital. An issue could cut this per-
centage back considerably, depending on
its size.
However, as the current dividend has
been paid for 14 years, it's hard to see
the directors making any moves which
would reduce it. Such being the case, con-
clusions can be drawn.
They are either that this and next
year’s profits will lift earnings on the pre-
sent capital to 25 p.c. or higher, or the
issue will only be a small one. The ans-
wer will be much more accessible when
the 1964 results come out next February.
Engineer Recovering
Tt appears that Melbourne-based In-
x dustrial Engineering could see a full
recovery to former earning rates in the
current year. At the annual meeting,
the chairman told shareholders that
directors were considering a further issue
of unsecured notes in order to finance
the increasing business which was coming
the company’s way. He also “antici-
pated” that, going on the first three
months of the year, earning rate would
improve considerably for 1964-65.
Earnings have been somewhat down
in the dumps since 1961-62, when the
already uninspiring performance of
14.1 p.c. in the year before crumbled
catastrophically to 5.7 p.c. Fortunately,
recovery set in early, so that the 10.9
p.c. earned in 1962-63 enabled the
steady dividend of 10 p.c. to go out
covered. It had been reduced to this
rate from the 121 p.c. paid in 1960-61.
The chances for a return to this rate
in the current year are quite good. Profit
in 1964-65, up from £201,000 to
£248,000, would have just about covered
such a payout. If the earnings move
back to 1960-61 levels this year, and
there is every reason to believe that they
will actually do better than this, then
there will be every cause for share-
holders to expect a dividend lift, if not
a full return to the former rate.
Something in Stafford
HThere could be something in Stafford-
Ellinson’s ss. shares at present. They
are selling for about 2s. lid. and yielding
more than 8 p.c. from the 5 p.c. divi-
dend. The annual report from thi
Melbourne-based manufacturer of men**
clothing said sales and profits in the first
quarter of the current year were con-
siderably higher. A satisfactory six
months is expected, subject to the usual
seasonal conditions, and forward orders
for next winter are bigger too.
Investors generally do not think very
highly of the company; first because of
its trade and secondly because 1963-64
saw a fall in earnings from 11.2 p.c. to
8.3 p.c. and a dividend cut from 8 p.c.
to 5 p.c. This was only the second year
on the public lists. Although dividend
expectations were upheld in the first year,
the 11.2 p.c. earnings were still rather
low, having come back from 12.3 p.c. in
1961-62.
Nevertheless, a return to 8 p.c. divi-
dends this year should at least warrant
market sales at par. Although the com-
pany is not one to pin any great hopes
on, its present and future dividend pay-
ing capacity will make it a good income
stock as long as one is prepared to sell
out when it next becomes apparent that
the fluctuations which periodically harass
the rag trade are about to take their toll
again.

Fibre Containers’ share price anticipations
During the calendar years 1962 and
1963, the shares of Fibre Containers
Ltd sold within the range of 255. and
17s. In November, 1963, it was
announced that the remaining interest in
Hercules Fibre Containers Pty Ltd would
be sold to Carlton and United Breweries
Ltd (who had been an important custo-
mer of this subsidiary for many years
and a part-owner since 1960). This sale
of a major asset seems to have lifted the
share price levels of Fibre Containers
Ltd, for, during 1964, prices have ranged
between 265. and 19s.
The implications of the sale of this
subsidiary are known only to the com-
pany, because it seems that a proportion
of Hercules’ business will remain with
Fibre Containers and it may well be that
this will be the most profitable portion.
Nevertheless, it is clearly set out in the
1963-64 report that Hercules’ trading
profit for the first five months of the
fiscal year amounted to £71,402. This
sum represents no less than 21.2 p.c. of
the total net profit from trading in that
year (including Hercules’ five months’
profit). If we assume that proportional
profits would have been made by Her-
cules in the remaining seven months, then
group net profit from trading for the
whole year would have been about
£436,000. This figure compares fairly
closely with the £451.000 approximately
of the previous year and is £lOO,OOO
more than the actual profit in 1963-64.
These figures would suggest that Her-
cules would have been contributing
nearly 40 p.c. of the net profit from tra-
ding. Because of other income, and
perhaps differing taxation, Hercules
would only have contributed just over
26 p.c. of the net after tax.
interesting statistic which can
be deduced from the last three years’
profit statements is the profits which
would appear to have been included in
the total in respect of Hercules in each
of the three years. This deduction is
based on the assumption that the pro-
portionate share between the majority
and minority shareholders in Hercules
would not have changed from year to
year but would have remained the same.
This suggests that the earnings for the
group excluding Hercules would have
been as follows:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964
Estimated earnings
excluding Hercules £190,000 £212,000 £193,000
Adjusted earning rate 18.2% 20.3% 18.5%
Earning rate unadjusted 22.5% 25.9% 22.1%
There are good reasons for believing
that these figures are too gloomy. As
mentioned before, a portion of the Her-
cules’ business will remain with Fibre
Containers. While I can only be guess-
ing, I would estimate this at about 45
p.c. of the total business. This estimate
is based on the assumptions that the net
worth of Hercules when acquired by
Carlton was about £370,000. The shares
actually sold appear to have cost
£200,000 and a profit of £101,667 was
made on the sale, so Fibre's portion of
the Hercules’ business was valued at
£301,667. This share of the business
received about 8H p.c. of the total pro-
fits, so presumably the portion receiving
18i p.c. was valued at £68,333 approxi-
mately. However, if lam correct in esti-
mating that annual earnings were of the
order of £70,000, the return on net
worth would be nearly 19 p.c. This
would be an exceptionally high return
and I have guessed that the return would
be nearer to 10 p.c. In other words, the
expected profit from Hercules after the
other business has been removed is ex-
pected to be about £37,000 and “the
other business” will produce about
£33,000 net profit. This proportion is
nearer to 47£ p.c. but some allowance
must be made for error.
Tt must be emphasised that the fore-
going is only guesswork and it may
well be that by the time this article is
published the whole position will have
been clarified at the annual general
meeting.
In the meantime, it is appropriate in
my view to estimate the current year's
earnings at about the level of £234,000
and to use this figure, which is slightly
higher than the published earnings for
last year, in making calculations regard-
ing earnings yields. The problem now
remains to assess what should be paid
for a share that has a potential earnings
of about Is. lid. but which hasn't
exhibited any growth in earnings over
the last three years. In my view it
would be generous to be prepared to pay
fifteen times earnings and this multiple
would price the shares at only 16s. 101 d.
Over the last five years, the market
growth, earnings growth and dividend
growth have been as follows:
1960 196 V 1962 1963 1964
Market price 100 107 138 185 149
Earnings 100 107 102 116 87
Dividends 100 100 142 159 170
These indices show that dividends per
share have shown the most sustained
growth over this period, while in the
preceding five years the pattern would
have been something as follows:
1956 1957 1958 1959 1960
Market price 100 106 144 197 252
Earnings 100 125 139 190 194
Dividends 100 100 100 123 123
Here the earnings grew more rapidly
than dividends and the market price even
outstripped the earnings.
No doubt the price of Fibre Containers
will be sustained at and above its present
level for some time to come, on the
assumption that some “powerful over-
seas paper interest” will pay an out-
rageous price for the shares. It may
well be also that the growth pattern of
the second half of the 'fifties will be
repeated in the second half of the ’sixties.
As long as the purchaser realises that he
is paying a price based on the full anti-
cipation of either of the above specula-
tions, 20s. is reasonable.


You may close your factory,
but can you afford to close your mind
to Advertising in January?
If your point of view about advertising over
the holiday period is . . . “Don’t advertise
in January . . . nobody is home . . . every-
body is on holidays”, you could be missing
out on the best-selling months of the year.
HERE ARE THE FACTS ON JANUARY
Every year many commercial and industrial
organisations close down for three weeks.
At this time of the year the whole family is
free to go out buying. Their pockets are
loaded with holiday pay. They have nothing
but time on their hands to shop.
Retailers have realised this fact. January
is the month of big Summer Sales, Below
Cost Bargains, Specials, Save, Save, Save.
Retailers spend up big in January to grab
a share of this holiday money spending
market.
WHERE DO NATIONAL ADVERTISERS
FIT IN THE JANUARY SPEND UP?
Many advertisers and their agents be-
lieve people stop drinking coffee, buying
cigarettes, using soap, washing clothes, buy-
ing petrol. It certainly seems this way
because they don’t bother to advertise during
this holiday season. The actual fact is more
coffee is consumed, more cigarettes smoked,
more washing powder used because more
clothes get dirty, and more petrol used be-
cause people on holidays have more time to
go places. But are they using your products?
What would happen if you stopped adver-
tising and your competitors did not for a
month or more in the middle of the year?
The answer undoubtedly is that your share
of market would decrease. The same over
the Christmas and New Year holiday period.
Not all advertisers stop advertising only
the ones that think they can afford to lose
a share of their market. These progressive
advertisers kept on advertising right through
the holiday period last year. They are big
advertisers who know the worth of January
selling.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Holding for Expansion
The success that Brown built
TPew companies have proved as lucrative
to shareholders as Brownbuilt Ltd.
Since 1950-51 there have been seven
capital issues—three at par (55.,) two at
a premium and another two under the
bonus label. Despite the big increases
which ordinary capital has seen over this
period, dividends have never suffered (in
fact, they are now at a peak of 15 p.c.),
earning rates have been generally main-
tained at more than 30 p.c. on the aver-
age, and share prices have moved con-
stantly higher.
The scrip is fairly priced around the
present level of 245. 6d., which yields
3 p.c., after brokerage, from the dividend.
Buying should be only for the medium
to long term, during which time the
extremely rosy future should be well
evidenced by further upward swings in
the market valuation and more issues to
the shareholders.
Although the company’s public history
dates from 1936, its earliest beginnings
can be traced to 1885, when the late
E. T. Brown set up an engineering work-
shop in Clifton Hill, one of Melbourne’s
inner suburbs and the location of the
present head office. Plants and offices
are now operating in most States. Actu-
ally, the present title has only existed
since March this year, when shareholders
approved the change from E. T. Brown
Ltd. Directors expect the new name to
eliminate possible confusion and assist
marketing operations. For many years
now the five subsidiaries have traded
under the name of Brownbuilt, while the
parent has been clinging to memories and
tradition.
with the name change came the
* decision to concentrate group activities
into two basic divisions. The steel equip-
ment sector handles office furniture and
storage equipment. Some of the bigger
contracts in 1963-64 included shelving
for the University of WA’s library,
mobile shelving at St Vincent’s Hospital
in NSW and double-deck shelving for
a Qantas storeroom, also in NSW.
Although the group does excellently in
the office trade, it is in this bigger indus-
trial field where competition is stiffest.
However, the wide ranges, years of ex-
perience and an excellent advisory ser-
vice keep the company in front as one
of the leaders in this field.
In Sydney during the year, the division
installed its own metal cleaning, phospha-
ting, painting and baking plant, causing
a certain amount of disruption and loss
of operating efficiency. Things have now
settled down and profits should benefit
from the activities of this plant in the
current year. In Canberra, an office,
showroom and warehouse have been
built to serve the growing demand in the
ACT and to more firmly identify the
group to the market there. Premises in
SA were expanded.
The new premises in Canberra will
also handle the local business for the
group’s other sector, the metal sections
division. This manufactures roof deck-
ing and cladding as well as the recently
introduced ‘'general purpose” metal sec-
tions. These can be applied to a very
wide range of usage, from television
switchboards to trailer chassis to plastic
coated stainless steel decorative trim for
domestic appliances. However, decking
is by far the most important product in
this division and mills are operated in
Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Bris-
bane. Expansion in the past two years
has increased total output from 10 mil-
lion feet to 16 million feet in 1963-64.
The keys to the company’s extremely
successful year were the continued expan-
sion in the building industry combined
with new products and, as usual, strong
marketing promotion in each field. For
the first time, sales topped the £5 million
mark. Considerable finance was spent on
expansion and further efforts were made
to develop an export market, mainly in
SE Asia and Papua-New Guinea. Sales
here improved but, as yet, the business is
still basically in the embryo stage.
What, then, of the current year and the
future generally? It seems inevitable that
profits will rise, although not to the same
extent as in 1963-64. Last year’s expan-
sion and the continued buoyancy in the
building industry must all leave their
mark. In the four months to the end of
October, sales were up by 19 p.c. Pro-
fits had also gained, but not by quite as
much, thanks mainly to increasing costs.
The directors’ policy has always been to
absorb these as much as possible, chiefly
through greater mechanisation.
Around £550,000 is to be raised for
expansion in the current year. Of this,
£400,000 will be through an unsecured
note issue and the rest by a mortgage
loan. Shareholders have no complaints
that they are being overlooked, even
though earning rates are so high and
dividend is twice covered just now. Barely
twelve months ago they took part in a
one-for-five bonus issue, on which they
collected the final 7i p.c. dividend for
1962-63 even though that year had closed
more than four months before they re-
ceived their shares. On this higher capital


Too Much
Warmth
This can certainly break up friendships.
Especially in Summer. The answer is
more coolth. The office building is a
good example. Everyone wants better
air conditions, especially if accompanied
by low costs. This is vyhere controlled
mechanical ventilation comes into its
own. It removes all stale air, smoke,
cooking odours and the like, replacing
continuously with clean filtered air. No
need to do the whole building at once—
have a test area treated first.

they have also received the bigger
1963-64 dividend, lifted from 12} p.c. to
15 p.c.
The money raised will be used entirely
for the financing of expansion. A new
factory on 21 acres at Nunawading (Vic.)
should be completed sometime in
December and be producing in February.
The metal sections division will be trans-
ferred to and consolidated on this site.
The whole project will absorb about
£217,000. The Thornbury (Vic.) steel
equipment building will be extended and
developed at an estimated cost of
£lBO,OOO. The cost of a new plant to
make decking in WA will be £65,000 —
this project will mean the saving of trans-
port costs involved in delivering from
SA.
The accompanying table illustrates in
figures the successful ’sixties and the
currently strong financial position. Des-
pite last year’s bonus, reserves are still
well ahead of paid capital. Another
issue could be made now with little
trouble, although it is extremely unlikely.
Working capital is at a best-ever level
and shows a high degree of liquidity.
Fixed assets show a constant history of
growth and intangibles have finally been
written away. (There have been no asset
revaluations since 1950-51, which is as
far as our records go.) Ordinary capital
growth reflects all the issues of the past,
while points must be scored for keeping
loan capital down, even though the posi-
tion will have changed somewhat since
balance date. The rising share price
trend illustrates only too well the huge
increase in status which the scrip has
enjoyed over the past few years.
To sum up: present prices are good
for those buying to hold for at least a
year. Between now and the interim
report, the lull of Christmas may well
provide even better opportunities for
moving in. The current year should
see higher profits, steady dividends and
steady share prices on the whole. But
1964-65 may see another issue, depend-
ing on the progress of expansion plans.
Whatever happens, those who buy with
the long term in view would be hard
pushed to find a stock offering better
capital growth prospects, barring those of
a more speculative nature.

MAICO INDUSTRIES LTD
Anniversary Coming Up
current 1964-65 financial year
A could well provide shareholders of
Malco Industries Ltd with “additional
benefits”, for 1965 marks the 50th anni-
versary of the formation of the original
company, Malleable Castings Pty Ltd,
which is still the largest operating com-
pany of the group.
However, any special bonus issue to
mark the event is subject to an improve-
ment in current earnings, for although
the company’s reserve position is strong,
the earning rate over the past few years
has given only a moderate coverage to
the dividend requirement.
Malco Industries Ltd, the present
company, came into existence in 1950,
following the merger of Malleable Cast-
ings Ltd and E. W. Fittings Ltd, two
associated companies. Paid-up capital at
this stage was £400,000 in 20s. shares.
These were split to ss. units in 1960.
Since then, capital has been almost
doubled, principally by takeovers, al-
though-shareholders have participated in
a 2-for-9 issue at par in 1951 and a
l-for-4 issue of 8 p.c. notes, convertible
into ordinary shares at par on July 1
next year.
The takeovers have all been in allied
fields and the group now operates
through eight different subsidiaries. The
largest of these is still Malleable Castings,
which is now one of the biggest foundry
organisations in Australia. It recently
negotiated a contract with the Federal
Government for the supply of bodies
for mortar bombs.
Current demands on the group’s
foundry are high, which will necessitate
expansion of production capacity in the
near future.
One of the largest takeovers by the
group was the acquisition of Hasemer
Crane and Engineering Ltd, by the ex-
change of seven Malco shares for every

i The acquisition of this subsidiary,
completed in February, involved con-
siderable development work, as well as
the revaluation of that company’s stocks

tional liabilities. As a result, trading
results for the period to June were not
as satisfactory as expected. Results
Should show an improvement in the cur-

Though below directors’ expectations,
profit for the group for the latest year
showed an increase of more than 50 p.c.,
{from £83,434 to £126,132. The profit
jis by far the best of any year since list-
ing. However, earning rate in the latest
pear did not show a corresponding in-
crease because of the higher capital em-
ployed. The earning rate rose only

almost for a l-for-2 bonus issue. In
addition, the greater part of the freehold

tion or earlier.

During the current year, the company
faces a comfortable increase in earn-
ings. As in past years, directors plan
to maintain the drive for export sales.
While the problems of costs remain,
they do not expect earnings from this
source to play a significant part in group
earnings. The two subsidiaries which
incurred deficits in the 1963-64 financial
year are already showing an improve-
ment in the current year, which should
aid the overall result.
The shares are currently selling
around 7s. 6d., at which price they show
a dividend yield of 6.7 p.c.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Fifth Annual Report
Good growth rate on drab market
T adies and Gentlemen:
It is with considerable satisfaction
that this fifth annual report and accounts
covering the 12 months ended Novem-
ber 30, 1964, are laid before you. As
has been our practice in the past, every
effort has been made to present these
accounts as quickly as possible. In this
regard, we are proud of our record both
for this year and for previous years.
PROFIT. Directors are pleased to
report a profit of £3652. This is a little
less than last year’s record of £4253. At
first glance the growth rate of 37 p.c.
on the end-of-the-year value may appear
disappointing when compared with
previous years. The directors, however,
are very pleased with this result, as we
consider two factors materially affected
the result. First was the fact that the
stock market is still at the same level as
it was last year (it rose 20 p.c. in the
previous year). And the second reason
is that the portfolio is becoming rather
unwieldy, so that the law of diminishing
returns is starting to make itself felt.
The history of growth of the diary
since it was started with an initial £2OOO
five years ago is:
End of year Growth
Value Rate
1960 £3115 64 p.c.
1961 £4867 55 p.c.
1962 £7400 54 p.c.
1963 £9953 74 p.c.
1964 £13,605 37 p.c.
TRADING REVIEW. As usual
directors spared no effort to maximise
profits. Towards the end of the year
our efforts were frustrated by the dull
state of the market. While this is dis-
appointing, directors consider that the
present low level of the market provides
an excellent base for medium-term in-
vestment.
Realised profits for the year included
Tableland Tin (£677) and Hanimex
(£330). The remaining Hanimex left in
the portfolio are showing a paper profit
of just under £250. Another paper profit
over the £2OO mark is Treloar. Return-
ing to realised profits, other stock trans-
actions which showed over £lOO gain
included Elder Smith, ODE, Paynter
and Dixon, and New Broken Hill.
If 1963 was sugar year, then 1964
can rightly claim to be tin year. The
most ironical “mistake” made during
the year was the sale of 400 Renison
shares and 400 Renison rights at a loss
of a few pounds. The shares had been
purchased cum the issue at 365. in
February. If held, they would now be
showing a £l6OO gain!
Paradoxically the largest realised loss
was a tin share. Ardlethan Tin sent £74
down the drain. On the industrial side,
Aeron topped the list with a loss of £67J
Only small profits were shown onl
the two completed shorting transactions
(Marcus Clark and International Foot,
wear). Nevertheless, a certain amount
of satisfaction was gained as both shares
continued to fall heavily.
THE PAST AND THE FUTURE.
The diary has been in operation for five
years. In this period it has managed to
increase the original investment of
£2OOO to £13,605.
The present chairman has held his'
position for the last two years. Untill
now his task has simply been to try and/
accumulate funds. But by August this!
year it was realised that the portfolio
size was getting out of hand. Prompted,
then by a personal plea from Dr Coombs!
to withdraw some of the diary’s strength
from the market, he met the challenge!
head on. All but £2OOO has now been’
given to the Central Bank. Never let it
be said that trading banks are the only
ones to heed central banking policy!
Thus the diary starts the new financial
year with a £2OOO portfolio. /
FUTURE PROSPECTS. The smaller'
portfolio should not be taken as an j
indication of a lack of investor con-!
fidence. On the contrary, the future,
especially in the medium term, seems
bright—provided that you stick to the
broker’s favorite cliche, “selective buy-;
ing”.
Gas Peak
/Commonwealth Industrial Gases
Ltd earned yet another record profit
in the year to September 30. The fourth
new peak in succession, it rose from
£1,406,978 to £1,500,666 and moved;
earning rate up from 27.5 p.c. to 28.8
p.c. The company still pays an 11 p.c.
dividend.
Both tax (£1,263,519) and depreciation J
(£1,199,928) were significantly higher j
than the previous year's provisions. At j
the shareholders’ meeting on January 22
directors will seek permission to split
the 20s. shares (currently priced around
1025.) into 10s. units and to amend the
company’s articles of association to bring
them into line with more modern com-
pany practice.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Other Side of Woolmark
More than just a quality symbol
Most woolgrowers concede that the
provision of an international trade-
mark denoting quality woollen merchan-
dise —the Woolmark—is a good idea in
theory and one which should at least be
given a reasonable tryout. There is much
more to Woolmark, though, than the
quality symbol itself.
The textiles manufacturer (that is, the
spinner and the weaver of the cloth) who
qualifies for Woolmark also qualifies for
an IWS subsidy to his own private
advertising and promotion campaign.
This is the other side of the picture and
this is the crux of the criticism levelled
at the IWS.
The woolgrower and the general
public are completely in the dark about
this handout of IWS moneys (that is,
woolgrowers’ and public moneys) that
goes along with Woolmark. The con-
figuration of the symbol itself is neither
here nor there. The shape, to be sure,
should be artistic and original and easily
recognisable. Let us say, then, that the
Woolmark that has been arrived at does
fulfil these requirements, and let us leave
it at that.
But let us take a closer look at what
goes with Woolmark.
It is a situation really quite without
parallel. It is like Broken Hill paying
for the advertising of Holden cars.
No one is told which firm gets what.
'And the IWS (International Wool Secre-
tariat, sponsored largely by Australia with
assistance from New Zealand and South
Africa) will not tell. It will not tell be-
cause it believes that if it did so it would
be revealing secrets which the synthetics
could capitalise on.
Yet the contention —by the IWS —that
the synthetics people do not know
exactly hardly stands up to investigation.
The textiles manufacturer who takes
! Woolmark, and the money that goes with
j it, is in no way debarred from processing
(synthetic fibres at the very same time.
I Many, in fact, do just that.
| These manufacturing firms are natur-
ally in pretty close contact with the
suppliers of all fibres which suit their
spindles. This includes synthetics sup-
pliers. If the firms are not actually pro-
cessing both synthetics and wool, they
are assuredly in contact with colleagues
who are. It would not require the ser-
vices of a super-spy to find out what goes
on.
There is no possible way the IWS can
stop the manufacturer entitled to use
Woolmark on his woollens also pro-
cessing synthetic fibres —or, indeed,
blends if he wants to. All it can do is
ensure that the actual symbol is fixed
only to the woollens.
There may be even some doubt about
that as far as the American manu-
facturers, currently being wooed by the
IWS, are concerned. American manu-
facturers may very well insist on being
allowed to fix Woolmark to blends. What
heightens this possibility is the uncom-
fortable thought that some of the biggest
textile manufacturers in the US are sub-
sidiaries of the giant synthetic fibre pro-
ducers such as du Pont.
The IWS can inspect the quality of
woollens and worsteds, insisting that they
be of a certain standard before bestowing
the blessing of Woolmark. That is as far
as the IWS can go. It cannot, for in-
stance, insist on a certain percentage of
a particular mill’s output being woollens
and worsteds.
The IWS is now getting funds from
woolgrowers (plus taxpayers’ money in
the form of a grant from the Australian
Government) to the tune of £l7 million
a year. Most of this, on the admission
of the managing director, Mr W. J. Vines,
will be allocated to the Woolmark pro-
gramme.
The IWS does other things, of course.
Many woolgrowers would agree that
some of these other things, particularly
in the technical sphere, are extremely
valuable. They do not cost anything like
£l7 million a year to run.
We might assume, therefore, that about
£l5 million a year will go to Woolmark.
Some woolgrowers are arguing that this is
not promotion at all, but a form of dis-
counting—at the rate of £l5 million a
year—in a not particularly efficient form.
As the IWS will not tell how many reci-
pients of Woolmark moneys there will be,
it becomes an interesting exercise to try
to arrive at some figures without their
help.
The best way of deciding how many
manufacturers (important ones) there are

VOBICa,
in the world is to go back to the Inter-
national Textiles Organisation meeting in
Germany last year. This meeting brought
together the major wool textiles firms of
the world. There were, in all, 550 dele-
gates (people) present. As a delegation
usually consists of three, it might appear,
then, that there are about 180 to 200
major manufacturers.
The claim of the IWS that the Wool-
mark symbol will be seen in 90 countries
eventually is invariably misunderstood.
The IWS does nothing to correct the
altogether false assumption of most
people that this means hundreds of
manufacturers in 90 countries will be
using Woolmark. It means nothing of
the kind. There are not 90 important
textiles manufacturing countries, to begin
with.
All it means is that textiles manufac-
tured by 180 to 200 firms in Britain,
Japan, USA and some half dozen other
countries will eventually find their way,
as exported goods, on to the counters of
shops in 90 countries. Naturally they will.
So we have about 180 to 200 firms
whacking up about £l5 million a year
between them, which works out at around
£75,000 each.
There is another claim made by the
IWS in relation to Woolmark which has
never been properly explained. It is
said that the makers-up of woollen tex-
tiles (i.e., the tailoring and retail firms,
etc.) will be licensed. As there would
be literally thousands, possibly even mil-
lions, of these, the question of really
licensing every one becomes a task clearly
beyond the powers of the IWS, even with
its 600-odd staff.
What will happen is probably this: a
shop selling clothes made from certified
Woolmark fabrics will be permitted to
put up a Woolmark sign in the window.
It will be a “licence” similar to the
arrangement whereby a shop selling
Rothmans cigarettes, for instance, puts
up a Rothmans sign. Likewise, thou-
sands of volume tailoring and dress-
making firms throughout the world will
be able to sew Woolmark symbols into
their products, provided they are made
from certified Woolmark cloth or, in the
case of knitwear, Woolmark wool.
There is another way of arriving at
the approximate number of likely recipi-
ents of Woolmark subsidies. The IWS,
in expansive mood, announced that 86
entries had been received for the compe-
tition to find a suitable configuration for
Woolmark. As this was one of these
competitions that no one knew about
until it was over, it may be concluded,
perhaps, that the 86 advertising agencies
that submitted entries were the very ones
most likely to benefit. The winner does,
in fact, handle advertising for one of
Italy's largest textiles firms.
It may well be, then, that 86—and not
200—manufacturers are dividing up
£l5 million a year. This would work
out at around £200,000 each per year.
We might split the difference and come
up with, say, about 150 getting about
£lOO,OOO each.
They may, of course, pass some of it
on to the maker-up of suits, or dresses,
or what have you. That would be their
business.
Latest shot in the spending spree is to
hire Miss World at £12,500 a year to
promote wool. This makes the demure
Miss World nearly as well paid as Mr
Vines himself.
Presumably Miss World will influence
the females of the species to buy clothes
similar to the ones the IWS will rig her
out in. It’s a risky proposition, though.
Being capricious creatures, a good many
females can be expected to wear any-
thing but the clothes Miss World will be
promoting.
Let’s give the girl a chance, though,
•by all means. She is apparently a very
business-like young woman.
It is said that when she was first
approached with the idea of working
for the International Wool Secretariat her
reply was: “Oh, no. I feel I can do
much better than secretarial work now.”
It would be all' good fun except that
wool prices are now, as of writing, about
20 p.c. down on the same period last
year. Official textile sources in Japan
have hinted strongly that, for a number
of reasons, the growth rate of their in-
dustry, 7 p.c. over the last five years,
must recede to about 2 p.c. And the
new British Labor Party’s economic
policies may force UK buyers to limit
their purchases also.
Then there is the little matter of the
pending Court challenge to the validity
of the promotion levy on woolgrowers.
The IWS does not appear to take this
very seriously. Obviously some wool-
growers do. They have ascertained
already from the Minister, in reply to a
question in the House, that should the
challenge prove successful then moneys
levied for promotion will be refunded.
The money will not automatically be-
come available for any alternative method
of collecting it. (It is the method of
collection which is the basis of the court
action.)
New Look for UK Promotion
Manipulating Australia’s standard image
some years Australia has boasted,
A possibly with justification, that the
methods it has developed for promoting
the sale of commodities in its biggest
market, the United Kingdom, are
matched by those of no other country.
Even America, it has been claimed,
studies Australia’s promotional tech-
niques.
Yet there has always been a risk that
this very distinction will be its own un-
doing, for there has been nothing to stop
competitors from imitating the system
and then going one better. Now, how-
ever, Australian trade promotion in the
UK is about to undergo a change which
should ensure that, in terms of promo-
tional equity, what it earns it keeps.
Commodities involved include dried
and canned fruits, apples, and pears,
fresh meat, canned meat, frozen eggs,

their promotion is Ken Jarvie, who
parted talking about a new plan with the
various trade and commodity boards soon
(after his appointment as Trade Commis-
sioner last February. Jarvie is not just
a n eager new boy, for he had already
(rubbed shoulders with the British market
luring an earlier spell in the same job.
He does not apologise for the methods he
js reforming, but regards them as having
,een a natural step towards something
jetter.
At the same time, drawbacks in the
previous system are clear. One is that
money and staff were tied up in organi-
sing an exhibition months before it hap-
pened, at a cost out of proportion to the
[benefits that followed. Now, the work of
she Australian Government Trade Pub-
licity Directorate’s staff will be reframed
so that it is concentrated in only two
directions: liaison with head offices and
.branch offices of importers and agents,
(and liaison with the head office manage-
ment of chain groups.
' Under the old system there has been a
'tendency for the Directorate’s campaigns
fo move off under their own steam, with
a result that importers do not participate
pso fully or get so much out of them as
they should. Now, instead of just being
told an Australian trade promotion is in
(the offing and co-operating only during
the event, importers and agents will work
closely with the Directorate at the plan-
ning stage so that activities can be
tailored to suit them as well.
The day of provincial exhibitions,
jwhen Australians arrived like a travelling
(circus with boomerangs, canned food and
[placards, set up shop for a fortnight and
Iwere forgotten about almost as soon as
[they left, is over. In the system that is
'replacing it, officials will expect more
help from British trade partners, more
'residual effect with consumers, and more
'value for the £l| million spent annually
on pushing Australian food and wine
into British mouths.
W/hereas most promotion in Britain has
hitherto been organised regionally,
Australian fortnights erupting here and
there all over the country, from now on
organisation will be central and co-
operation with merchandising groups and
other collaborators will be permanent.
Promotional activities, instead of being
switched on and off with perhaps a year
or two between exhibitions at any one
town, will now be idling over all the
time, to rev up whenever required in sup-
port of a specific commodity or in re-
sponse to the needs of a season, accord-
ing to plans worked out with importers
and merchants.
Under the new plan, instead of going
from one door to another, leaving each
to close after it or be opened by some-
one else, Australian trade promotion will
have a foot in many doors continuously.
Under the old system many of the most
important doors were denied to it, for
the big chain groups were virtually ex-
cluded from area promotions because in-
dividual branches could not make isolated
plans.
T>y working in advance with other par-
ties to promotion, the Directorate,
whose spending money comes from in-
dustry funds matched £ for £ by the Gov-
ernment, hopes to make the spending of
any additional sums more effective by
enabling them to be applied within the
framework of an already sound pro-
gramme. Conversely, co-ordination of
spending in advance can prevent over-
lapping and waste of funds.
Plans for 1965 envisage many more
chain promotions than have ever been
staged in a single year before. The
scheme’s continuity is expressed in the
design of the advertising that will go with
it. A theme has been chosen. It will
remain constant throughout all adver-
tising, only the detail changing according
to the product in question.
The theme, which will probably stand
for at least the next three years, is that of
surf and sun. This is not new, of course.
Many an Australian in Britain has been
depressed by the flogging given to
lantern-jawed lifesavers and fun-loving
sun-nymphs. But Jarvie and his men are
not deterred. They think that for a
grey homely place like Britain, sun and
surf still make the best appeal—and point
to the jump in migration figures during
the English winter to prove it.
So the ads that have been mapped out
have a constant motif of a tanned surfer
shooting the breakers, now with cans of
fruit balanced on his palm, now pouring
a glass of wine as the foam chases his
heels, now with some packets of “sun-
sational” Australian “Kangaroo” butter
on a tray. In this way, while the standard
image is making a cumulative Australian
impact, the product and brand name that
share the glory can be switched as often
as required to coincide with delivery
seasons and the overall promotional plan.
It has been decided that for produce with
such sharp seasonal peaks as lamb, the
programme can be augmented by hard-
hitting TV advertising.
