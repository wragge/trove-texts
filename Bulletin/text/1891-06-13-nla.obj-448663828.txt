The extraordinary reputation of Rowland's Macassar

offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle or. which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Howland & Sons, of 20,

necessary to buy no Macassar Oil, Kalydor or Odonto

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that how bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnece;sary expence. ThSs
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be fofmd a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which Will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Boir lof N.S. W. Lite House Sur-
geon to the Great Northern Hospital, Londnt.
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the t; eatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown, by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov-
6th 7th and Bth. 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what Is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified .lien entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from the>e diseases, who are scattered over oil parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises,
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My Qualification* I invite the fullest investigation into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observing the many phases of the Nervous and
bexua'. System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether X can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

JUNE 13, 1891.
The Key of Australia.
The Australian colonel, that martial dealer in
cheap shirts and pants who keeps this land in a
constant state of frenzy, is suffering just
now from a new seizure. Within the last
few months a universal desire for forti-
fications has set in, and a sudden demand for
ramparts and entrenchments has arisen all over
this harassed continent. Nearly every seaport
in Australia is now fortified, more or less, and
everywhere the alleged Australian soldier is
fooling with some ponderous iron object with a
hole in the middle of it; but this is apparently
only the beginning of the trouble. The Military
Commission, now sitting in Victoria, has evoked
the surprising fact that Melbourne, despite its
ponderous defences, is practically about as help-
less as it was in the early days when there was
not a single cannon in the whole province,
and when the invader would have had to be
brained with the 'butt-end of an old fowling-
piece. The visitor who wanders in the dark
around the shores of Port Phillip is perpetually
falling down with a whiz and a crash over
£lOO,OOO worth of big guns, but these guns, it
seems, are badly placed; and are not big enough,
and there aren’t enough of them ; and therefore
it is held by the best military authorities that
the harbour should be spotted over with torpe-
does as a further measure of protection. Then,
if the invader ever comes, he will be blown up,
and when he doesn’t come, a P. and O. liner
Avill probably be blown up instead, and by these
extreme measures, combined with some more
forts and a further assortment of big guns, the
“Key of Australia,” it is hoped, may be pre-
served from falling into the hands of the alien.
But while the Victorian Government is dealing
with this problem the authorities in Queens-
land, acting under the advice of another im-
ported officer, are considering the advisability of
erecting a series of ponderous ramparts at
Thursday Island, because that dreary, lone-
some little place is likewise the “ key of Aus-
tralia,” and must be defended at any cost. Also
yet another gang of Imperial officers have
proved conclusively that Albany must be forti-
fied without an instant’s delay, because it is the
only undeniable “key of Australia,” and its
loss would be fatal to the security and happi-
ness of this continent. Some more “key” of
the same description has lately turned up at
Fremantle, which is also in want of cannon and
entrenchments, lestjts loss should burst up this
rising nation ; and another British general has
issued a report within the last month, by which
it appears that Port Darwin is the one genuine
and original “key,” and, therefore, it is
eminently desirable that Port Darwin should be
made impregnable without an instant’s delay.
Further, the Age is of opinion that the Austra-
lians should bear a hand in the defence of India,
because the only authentic “key” of this
country is Herat, and all other keys are only a
base imitation and an infringement of copy-
right.
* # #
In addition to all this, about a dozen places
of more or less importance have been fortified,
to a greater or less in the past, because
each of them was the key of Australia; and
whenever each place was fortified it gave up
being a key there and then, and some other
place had to be fortified immediately afterwards
because it had somehow started to be a key,
and whenever the defences there were com-
pleted the new key of Australia also knocked
oft being a key. Each of these alleged
fortresses furnishes a job for another im-
ported officer and some more inspectors and
colonels, and commanders, and miscellaneous
warriors. Each of them requires some more
standing army to look after it, and each addi-
tion to the standing army furnishes more jobs
for still more colonels. When a new “key of
Australia ” is discovered and fortified, then the
cheap, unimportant warrior in charge hunts up
another key, and makes a job for his brother, or
Ins uncle, or his military grandfather, in looking
after it; and each new key leads to commissions
and percentages on the purchase of guns,
ammunition, torpedoes, and other swindles.
Then the multiplied colonels commence to drift
into Parliament and form a military party
there; and the army is used to hunt down
labourers who are dissatisfied with their wages;
and Australia begins to assume the airs of a
cheap, broken-down Great Power, and to make
an ass of itself generally. And the sum of all
this bellicose drivel is that every place on the
whole Australian coast is the key of Australia
if an enemy gets hold of it, and no place is the
key if the enemy doesn’t get it, while, in the
strictly military sense of the term, there isn’t
any key to Australia or to any other place, and
there never was a key to anywhere. The chief
object of the whole scheme, in short, is to
create a military spirit in Australia, and to
promote that tendency to big guns, reviews,
autumn manoeuvres, and warlike whoopings for
Britain’s gracious monarch, which is the surest
guarantee of the permanence of the empire.
* # *
The projects for the defence of Port Darwin,
Fremantle, and Thursday Island are fair
samples of the garish pig-headedness of the
average colonel. While Port Darwin is left un-
defended no enemy is likely to come there, for
there is practically nothing to get. The place
is the entrance to nowhere, there is scarcely
any population, there is hardly anything to
plunder, and if the town is captured the said
enemy can’t walk overland to Adelaide or Bris-
bane, so that for all practical purposes he might
as well be in the interior of Africa. No invader,
except one fresh from a lunatic asylum, is ever
likely to interfere with such a place for the next
century, for the job wouldn’t pay expenses.
But the imported general has a vague idea,
built up on European precedents, that a sea-
port must be defended simply because it is a
seaport. He knows that in Europe such a place
would be fortified to protect the shipping and
the inhabitants, and he is incapable of realising
that a seaport with no shipping or inhabitants
worth mentioning is in an entirely different
situation. And when Port Darwin is fortified
it is quite probable—should war break out—
that an enemy will come there. He will come
to steal the guns, in the first place, and to
knock out the garrison in the second. If this
country is insane enough to leave half a million
pounds’ worth of guns lying about in an exposed
situation where there is practically no one to de-
fend them, somebody is almost sure to come for
them, and the same thing would happen if a
bank-note was left hanging on a tree. If enough
fortifications are put up to protect the town
then it will require several times the present
population to protect the fortifications, for a
gun can no more defend itself than can the
same weight in old iron. Therefore, it will be
necessary to raise some more standing army to
watch over the guns, and more colonels will be
wanted, and more military demonstrations will
ensue, and some fresh ironclads and torpedoes
will be necessary to “co-operate” with the
fortifications, for, when a new fort is put up, an
ironclad is always wanted to keep the enemy
from getting too near it. Also, there will be
an urgent demand for a “strategic railway,”
because under present circumstances the
garrison would have to run a thousand miles to
reach a place of safety, and reinforcements
would have to walk a thousand miles in order
to come to their assistance. The railway will
be a dead loss, but if an enemy should come it
will be handy for him to travel by. All these
troubles could be obviated by leaving such a
place severely alone, but—in the strategic drivel
of the period—it is a “key,” and must be de-
fended accordingly.
* * #
Unfortunately, the bulk of even the most in-
telligent nation is exceedingly credulous, and
when any Jingo states that the key of Australia
is in danger it generally believes him there and
then, without asking for evidence. It never
stops to reflect on the mouldiness of this ancient
wheeze, or considers the eminent absurdity of the
whole theory. It is impossible for 4,000,000
people to fortify a whole continent, and it is
useless to waste the national wealth in fortify-
ing a few detached spots, for if the defences in
these scattered localities are sufficiently strong
to keep out an enemy, then the enemy—if there
is one—will land somewhere else, and if they
are not strong enough, then the same enemy—if
he exists at all—will capture them, and it will
cost another heap of money to recover them.
The common assumption is that the key of any
country is some mysterious and undefined spot
one or two miles square, and looking exactly
like any other spot, which, for some deep mili-
tary reason, must be defended at all hazards,
and when this place is lost it is all up with
everything and everybody. Yet experience has
knocked this theory into shivers every time the
two have come into contact. Herat is nominally
the key of India, but it has been captured over
and over again, and yet nothing has happened
to India, and Herat has proved a death-trap to
whoever entered it. Calais was the key of
France for centuries, but the English held it for
three hundred years and made no progress, and
now Calais is an undefended town, and nobody
has any use for it. The same rule holds good
all through history, and therefore when
some imported soldier drivels about the neces-
sity for fortifying some remote uninhabited spot
on the ground that it is the key of Australia, it
may be safely assumed that lie is either boom-
ing the great Imperial conspiracy, or else is
looking out for a profitable job. For Australia
hasn’t any key, and it doesn’t matter much
whether it has one or not, and it doesn’t want
one; and when it is inv.tcd to put up ramparts
on some desert spot and then hire a standing
army to look after them, and hoist the British
flag and holler for its beloved Queen, it would
prefer to stand out. And if at any future time
Australia should chance to have a key and some
enemy should capture it, the circumstance
really doesn’t amount to much, for if the enemy
is strong he will do just as much damage to the
country when he has captured the key as if he
had captured some other place instead, and if
he is weak the national forces will knock him
out of the key just as easily as they would
knock him out of any other locality.
The Orange Pot and the Roman Kettle.
The speech delivered by President R. T. Yale
at the annual congress of Victorian Orangemen,
held at Warrnambool, appears in extenso in the
local Standard, and is a fair sample of what
men will say when once inoculated by that most
deadly of all poisons—the virus of religious and
racial prejudice. It is strange that such a
speech should have been delivered at all;
stranger that it should have been spoken when
every library supplies infrangible proofs of its
virulent misstatements ; strangest of all that it
should have been spouted in a land whose
national motto is, or ought to be, “ Down with
your miserable re-incarnation of old-time
Romanist and Protestant feuds. To Tophet
with those who, while the morning twilight of
the twentieth century crimsons the horizon,
show their love for their adopted country by
planting and tending a crop of rank religious
weeds that have done so much in distant
lands to conceal and smother the fair tree of
Humanity.”

The toast of the evening was “ To the memory
of William, Prince of Orange, who freed us
from the tyranny, of ungodly men.” In pro-
posing it, Mr. Vale is reported to have said ;
They had bitter experience that the Church of Rome
was a church of greed and dogma—a church beyond their
conceptions in its social and political connections. . .
If he had time he would draw their attention more fully
to a fact which could not be denied—that the progress,
material comfort and general happiness of the people was
inconsistent with the full power of the Church of Rome.
For a thousand years the Church of Rome had controlled
the destinies of France—could send her men to the
gallows and her women to the stake. It had one-third
of the real property and one-third of the population. . .
The lords and the clergy claimed privileges and exercised
them, and these were not abrogated until the recent
period of the revolution. The Church did not raise one
finger to destroy these abominable claims of the feudal
laws of France. Coming to the present they should keep
in mind and never forget the essential differences between
members of the Catholic Church and members of the Pro-
testant Church. They, as Protestants, claimed the right
of private judgment, and they considered that no
priest and no bishop had the right to decide one
solitary question on their behalf. . . . Contrast the
position of the people under Catholic domination and
under Protestant freedom—take parts of Ireland and
priest-ridden Spain and the result was unmistake-
able. . . Take the positions in the colony of Scotch-
men and Englishmen—bank-directors, mine-managers,
members of stock exchanges, leading tradesmen, mer-
chants of every kind, and for one Catholic they could
name ten Protestants. Then turn to the names of those
who had joined the great majority, and to the record of
the wealth they had acquired and left behind, and they
would And men with thousands and tens of thousand's
who had belonged to the Protestant churches. He did
not desire to speak with any feeling of bitterness toward
the Catholic Church, and they had no wish to destroy it,
but he simply wished to point out to them these facts.
Protestants did not persecute. [Ours the italics.]
There was talk of abbeys and churches having been
destroyed, but these were not destroyed by men who had
been educated as Protestants, but by those who had been
brought up in the Catholic Church. In Spain, Italy and
other countries, the destruction of churches had not been
caused by Protestants, but by the Catholics themselves.

The foregoing excerpt does not contain all or
nearly all that the chairman said in proposing
the toast of the Dutchman whose advent freed
England from the “tyranny of ungodly men.”
But it contains enough to show how the simplest
historical lessons may be distorted or read back-
wards when anything is to be gained by doing
so. For the Church of Rome we hold no brief.
Wc do not belong to her communion ; it is im-
probable we ever shall, unless second childhood
should overtake us prematurely; our chief
motive in the matter now under discussion is
the cynical interest we feel in the doings of the
humbugs and fanatics who enslave wage-earning
mankind by making it fight for the shadow
while they themselves eat the meat and gnaw
the bone.
* # #
The world contains no impartial history.
Perhaps the nearest approach to impartiality
was made by the Englishman Hallam. As for
such writers as Hume, Alison, Macaulay,
Froude, and a host of others among our own
countrymen, not to mention the great con-
tinental historians, their productions, although,
in some instances, exquisite as works of art,
are too obviously one-sided to do more than
engender distrust. Still, there are certain
salient facts, the proofs of whose occurrence are,
in one sense, as strong as those of pons asinornm,
or of the impossibility of finding two determi-
nate numbers to represent the diameter and the
circumference of the same circle. In spite of
Archbishop Whately’s ingenious paradox, for
instance, he would be a bold controversialist
who denied that, on a certain June day in 1815,
a French army, commanded by one Napoleon
Buonaparte, was worsted in Belgium. How
that defeat was brought about is quite another
thing—the fact of the disaster is incontestable.
.So with the death of C.esar, the decapitation
of Scotch Mary, the murder of Henry of
Navarre, and the assassination of the present
Czar’s predecessor. The evidence for all these
occurrences is, in its own way, as strong as
for the existence of a large city on the shores of
Port Jackson. Nothing like the same evidence
exists regarding the life and works of Hercules,
of Homer, or of Christ. This brings us to Mr.
Vale’s remarkable statement, that “Protes-
tants did not persecute.”
* * #
We make bold to say that all Christian
Churches—the Quaker and, perhaps, a few
other obscure sects excepted—persecuted when
they had the power, and, in all likelihood,
would do the same again but for being muzzled
by advancing Secularism and widespread scep-
ticism. When Roman Catholicism was in power
it seldom hesitated to draw the sword. It
prompted the slaughter of the Albigenses, of
the Morescos, of the Huguenots. It showed no
mercy to the Lollards in England or to the
heretics in Flanders and in Spain. The abomina-
tions following on the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes were not disagreeable to it, nor were
those which desolated Germany during the
thirty-years’ war. But how did Protestantism
behave when it got in the saddle in
Northern Europe ? The very men who
proclaimed an open Bible and the right
of private judgment were those who muti
hated and massacred their fellow-country-
men who presumed to open the Bible and exer-
cise that right of individual opinion on its
bewildering contents. Of Elizabeth’s reign a
late writer says —“ The gaols swarmed with
recusants. Indeed, it is on the whole hard to
say why Queen Mary should have a monopoly
of the epithet ‘ bloody.’ ” Considering the
savage efforts made by English Protestants
during the ignoble Stuart dynasty to force
Episcopacy on the Scotch Protestants by means
of the bullet and the boot; the sufferings of
English Dissenters who, like Bunyan, failed to
recognise the necessity for bishops, and the long
dark nights of bondage that spread as a pall
over Papist Ireland almost to our own day, it is
difficult to read with calmness the statement in
this our time that “ Protestants did not perse-
cute ” —as if they were not to this hour only less
cruelly persecuting in Wales, because the power
to use axe, sword, thumbscrew, and firebrand
has been wrested from them.
# # *
To find creeds that did not persecute it is
necessary to fall back on some of the old Eastern
beliefs which, unlike Christianity, brought peace,
not the sword, among men. Even religions
derived from Christianity, such as Mahom-
medanism, have adopted persecution as the
shortest road to success. Mr. Yale’s assertion
that abbeys and churches were never destroyed
by men “who had been educated as Protes-
tants ” would be delightful reading in a camp
of Cromwell’s Ironsides or of French Hugue-
nots. The soldiers of the Commonwealth had
even less regard for old churches or stained
windows than the French Republican dragoons
who stabled their horses in Italian shrines and
bestowed moustaches on male and female saints
with a fine disregard of sex. There was some
excuse for the Frenchmen; there was no excuse
for the iconoclasm of the Roundhead saints who,
to use a vulgarism, “travelled” on religion
just as others endeavour to do to-day. All
this goes to show that fanaticism is much the
same whatever guise it wears. Masquerading
in the garb of Catholicism, it prompts men to
starve and scourge themselves in lonely cells, or
to fling women and children into the flames, as
Alva’s butchers did in the Low Countries ;
when labelled “Protestantism,” it burns and
racks and boots its opponent and hates its neigh-
bour for the love of God.
# # #
Mr, Vale accuses the Catholic Church of
greed, of not only permitting but abetting the
horrors of the feudal system in France, and of
raising no finger to abate those horrors till the
Revolution came and made short work of
feudalism and Catholicism alike. Yet this
very Revolution—this magnificent attempt to
rid the land of the monster whose three heads,
Monarchy, Aristocracy and Priestcraft always
belched in accord when heretics had to be burnt
or provinces desolated—this grandest of popular
uprisings in favour of oppressed mankind found
in Protestant England its bitterest and most
unrelenting foe. It was a decree of Napoleon’s
that put an end to the Spanish Inquisition, and,
but for the insensate opposition of mad George
the Third, such wedges of liberalism and secu-
larism would have been driven into Spain and
Italy as would give an uncomfortable squeeze
to the sacerdotalism which was ruining both.
As for greed—a celebrated historian once rose
from his books and proclaimed to the world that
for greed and meanness, he knew of no two
histories to equal those of the Church of
England and of the University of Oxford.
What has that Church through its bishops in
the House of Lords ever done to ameliorate
the condition of the people or lend a hand in
pulling the Car of Progress ? Is it not notori-
ous that the spiritual peers (the very term is
blasphemous) from time immemorial have pas-
sionately opposed all movements whose objects
were to raise or educate the masses? Sydney
Smith, himself a staunch churchman, wrote of
them : —“ It is a melancholy thing to see men
clothed in soft raiment, lodged in a public
palace, endowed with a rich portion of other
men’s industry, using their influence to deepen
the ignorance and inflame the fury of their
fellow-creatures. ”
* * *
If the Roman Church did nothing to abate
the abuses of French feudalism, what has the
Anglican Church done to forward British
liberty ? We are reluctantly obliged to inform
Mr. Vale and his confreres of a few things
it has done in the cause of “Pro-
testant Freedom ” —the words are his own.
In 1807 it was sought to establish rate-'*
supported schools in poor English districts.
The proposal was rejected without a division,
the Archbishop of Canterbury saying: “ Their
Lordships would feel how dangerous it might
be to innovate in such matters. Their Lord-
ships’ prudence would, no doubt, guard against
innovations that might shake the foundations
of our religion.” The faith that might be
shaken if Hodge were taught his ABC cannot
be said to be particularly robust. In 1810,
when an endeavour was made to punish the
larceny of five shillings by transportation for
life instead of death—there were then 223
offences punishable by strangulation the
bishops to a man voted against the proposal as
an innovation “that might shake the founda-
tions of religion.” In .1821, when an effort was
made to allow Roman Catholics to sit in Par-
liament ; in 1822, when it was proposed to let
Catholic peers sit in the Upper House ; in 1829,
when the Emancipation Bill was passed ; in
1831, when the Reform Bill was introduced, the
Anglican successors of the Apostles were venom-
ously hostile. Regarding the last measure,
the Archbishop of Canterbury declared that
it was “mischievous in its tendency, and
would be extremely dangerous to the fabric of
the constitution.” Mainly through episcopal
opposition, it took twenty-five years for the
Jewish Disabilities Repeal Bill to become law,
Archbishop Howley holding that: “ The


moral and intellectual capacity of the Jews
disqualified them for all legislative duties.”
The bishops voted to exclude Protestant Dis-
senters from Protestant universities ; to keep
popular education in the disgraceful condition
ni which it was 50 years ago; to retain religious
tests at universities ; to retain Church rates,
deeming them “ essential to the permanent
welfare of the Church;” to confer on churchmen
alone the privilege of having funeral services
performed over them in churchyards ; and to
disallow marriage with a deceased wife’s sister*.
These are but a few out of many examples of
“Protestant liberty,” as understood by the
princes of the Establishment. To give a man
an open Bible with full liberty of private judg-
ment, and then punish him for exercising the
latter, is not such a great boon after all.
Indeed, if the English hierarchy had had its
way, not only would the British people be now
the most ignorant on earth, but a large portion,
if not the bulk of Mr. Yale’s brother Orange-
men, would find the doors of British universities
slammed in their faces.
* # *
We have said nothing of English divines of
the 17th and 18th centuries—how they licked
the shoes of the pedantic slobberer, James 1.,
and attributed universal knowledge to the
greatest dunce in Christendom—the "dedication
of Mr. Yale’s “ open Bible ” is enough to leave
a bad taste in any honest man’s mouth ; how
they condoned the offences of the lecherous
Charles 11. and preached unquestioning
obedience to his bigot brother James till the
latter attempted to lay a heavy hand on their
ecclesiastical perquisites, when they promptly
turned against the Lord’s anointed; how,
during the regime of the brutal Guelphs, they
crept up backstairs to obtain promotion by
pouring gold into the laps of trulls. These
things are matters of history with which Mr.
Vale is or should be acquainted. At the pre-
sent moment the English bishops draw about
£170,000 a year in salaxhes, &c., besides
possessing the patronage of 2649 benefices valued
at sonxething like £890,000 annually. If Rome
then is greedy, dogmatic, and opposed to edu-
cation, her young English sister is a veritable
chip of the old block. Assuming that, on the
whole, Protestants are less superstitious and
bigoted than Catholics, that is but in accord-
ance with the fitness of things. It is but meet
and natural that a great religious or political
convulsion like the Reformation or the Revolu-
tion should end by leaving both parties, parti-
cularly the party of innovation, less x’eligiously
and politically superstitious than before. So
far as Liberalism is concerned, every Church is,
or should be, axx ad stance upon its predecessor.
Even before our eyes a xxew Protestantism is
being developed which is farther from that of
the Tudors than the latter is from Rome.
Dogmas once thought essential, such as eternal
punishment, and the efficacy of prayer, are
being quietly ignored or ostentatiously denied.
It is far from improbable that our children will
see a Protestantism which will regard Mr.
Yale’s as that of a small, ignorant, and bigoted
sect.
* * *
The Dutch William of the Orange society is
not the monarch of history. The former “ freed
us from the tyranny of ungodly men; ” the
latter gave us continental wars, the national
debt and an oligarchy unequalled for servility
and greed. He was uncultivated, sullen and—
he signed at top and bottom the warrant for the
cowardly massacre of Glencoe. His hungry
followers, like those of George I. subsequently
fell with sharp beaks and talons on the land.
To one of his mistresses he gave 95,000 acres of
his father-in-law’s land which she held till the
Parliament forced her to disgorge. In all Mr.
Vale’s address, however, there is nothing
droller than his charge against Catholics of
dying poor while Protestants die rich. The
very essence of Christianity is not alone to die
“without money and without debts,” but to
live in poverty. In dozens of places in Mr.
Vale’s open Bible he is told in language it
would be impossible to mistake that poverty is
peculiarly grateful to God, and that men should
take no thought for the morrow. To what has
“ militant Christianity ” sunk when its votaries
claim credit for dying rich, the very thing
which, of all othex-s, so stank in the nostrils of
Jesus? To proclaim one’s self a follower of
the ragged Socialist of Galilee and at the same
time rejoice at the prospect of dying rich is
magnificent in the stateliness of its absurdity.
Vale & Co. should read their Bible.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Standing Army.
At the present time, when one hears so
much loud and vociferous nonsense about
the necessity for a strong standing army,
it is worth while for the Australian people
to keep an eye on the course of events in
Chili, where too much army has brought a
prosperous little republic to unspeakable grief.
And having considered the results that have
arisen in that country through too many
colonels and a superfluity of warlike drivel, the
Australians might reasonably consider whether
it isn’t safer after all to run a Commonwealth
with no standing army at all, and trust entirely
to a citizen soldiery for defence against outside
enemies. Apart from its unhappy tendency to
fool around with guns and other destructive
implements, the Chilian republic is about as
well-constructed as any reasonable State could
be. It has a Parliament, both Houses of which
are elected on a much more liberal suffrage
than that of England or New South Wales, or
many other countries which run in democratic
reality behind it. It has a system of Local
Government which is nearly perfect, and a
President who is elected by the male population
on a basis which comes about as near to the
One-Man-Onc-Vote principle as any thing can do
without actually getting there. The qualifica-
tion of the elector is based on wages, and is
fixed so low that any man who works at all—
not being an absolute idiot, or deprived of both
legs —has a vote. When they fixed up their
constitution the Chilians wisely observed that
the snag on which many republics come to grief
is the excessive power of the President, where-
by that gentleman sometimes refuses to
quit at the end of his term, and there-
fore the presidential power is shared by a
Council, nominated by the Legislature, and no
single act of the President is lawful except with
the consent of this body. Education is compul-
sory and absolutely free, and law is so cheap
that almost any Chilian, however poor, can
run a big lawsuit if he wants to. ' Though
Chili is smaller and less fertile by far than
New South Wales, the country has an
immense railway system from which the
Government makes a profit of over £500,000 per
annum; the national debt is only about sixteen
millions, and the surplus has run as high as
£1,000,000 per annum. Barring Switzerland, in
fact, Chili was, for its size and resources,
almost the most prosperous little common-
wealth on earth. But, in addition to its other
advantages, it has a respectable standing army,
and after the great war with Peru, in which
this force covered itself with gore and glory,
it began to put on a considerable amount of
style. It was a splendid force, in its way, and
well-disciplined—which meant that it would
obey any order given by any brutal madman
who was in legitimate authority over it; and it
was full of martial ardour—which meant that it
would brain its own father, when directed to
do so, without the slightest compunction, in
the firm conviction that God would send in the
Government. Also it was enthusiastic,
courageous, and in every other way reliable—in
other words, it was filled with a certain hog-
like callousness and insensibility which comes
of much drill and military exercise, and would
go anywhere and disembowel anybody, or die
in the attempt. When President Balmaceda
went off his elevated chump and broke the
constitution all to shivers, and turned this
splendid machine against the nation and the
Legislature, it was a woeful surprise to Chili.
The army was just what a standing army
ought to be; it got its orders from the Presi-
dent to burn and pillage and destroy, and
because it had got its orders it went straight
ahead. Its members were Chilians, and like
other Chilians were proud of their country ;
but the first essential of an array is unquestion-
ing obedience, and they filled the bill to per-
fection. Any other army, properly trained,
would go the same road, and when the Austra-
lian Commonwealth is floated—if it ever floats
at all— : and the soft-goods colonels have fixed up
a Federal horde of homicides, that force will do
exactly the same thing should the occasion
come. If it doesn’t, then, as an army, it is a
hopeless failure. The one reason Avhy the
gouty, imported generals and commodores
prefer a small permanent force, rather than a
large citizen army, is that the citizen troops
never acquire that servile callousness which
makes them fit instruments for jumping on the
nation—they always feel that they themselves
are the nation, while the regular soldiers’
nation is the army itself, and nothing beyond
it. The country that pays for a big gang of
permanent assassins is simply sustaining a loose
tiger which may eat it up at any moment. It
supports the animal so that it may scare the
tiger next door, but as a rule both of them end
by eating their respective proprietors, or else
they sit on these proprietors, and wipe them
out by slow suffocation. And when one of the
animals fails to do this, it is a sure sign that it
isn’t big enough to be of any use whatever.

A Dirty Trick.
The Victorian Crown Law Department has
decided to let Colonel Templeton personally
meet £4OOO of expenses incurred in the earlier
stages of the Premier Building Association
prosecutions. The official liquidator, believing
himself entitled to act for the P.B.A. in that
affair, ran up a £4OOO bill ere the Government
sulkily took over the work which they could no
longer hold aloof from with safety. In the
meantime, a shareholder in the ruined society
had succeeded in stopping Templeton with a
Supreme Court injunction, and, if the public
had thereupon been content to let the scandal
die a miserable death, it is probable that the
Government would have paid all costs up to
date, and said no more about it. Everybody
knows that the legal ruling by which Mr.
Templeton was prohibited from going on,
except at his own expense, had the effect of
forcing the Government to go on in his place.
Gillies, Deakin, Peaeson and Cos. objected
to the prosecution of their former colleagues
and the Age’s blood-relation, on the ground
that it was “ misguided,” or uncalled-for, and
now Muneo, Shiels and Cos. may point to the
fact that the Age’s blood-relation wasn’t
actually convicted of anything, and say —
“ What did the other Government tell
you all along?” The conspiracy trial aborted,
as a matter of fact. Two of the defendants
were not found guiltless of the bare-faced
swindling alleged against them, but the present
Government refused to institute further pro-
ceedings, and so the long drawn-out agony
lapsed. Even on the main issue, then, the
official liquidator of the P.B.A. showed suffi-
cient cause why the Crown, and not he, should
have initiated these notorious prosecutions.
Furthermore, it must be remembered that a
considerable portion of the costs charged to
Colonel Templeton represents the legal price of
two actual convictions, because the trouble
started with the minor indictments of Mxeams
and Doherty, both of whom are now in gaol.
They were jugged for transgressions of an Act
of Parliament which the Crown is bound, by all
that is financially upright and holy, to maintain
in its integrity. True, the Crown does not
maintain the aforesaid Act. The Crown’s bosom
pals (always supposing that Gillies, Munko,
and such people possess bosoms) are alleged to
have offended against the Act in all directions,
and to be still doing so. The Crown is, at this
very moment, sleeping with one eye open whilst
Mr. J. A. Wallace brings an action against
the “ Premier ” directors to recover a £6OOO
deposit, accepted by them in contravention of
their rules and in defiance of the poor old down-
trodden Act. But the Government’s methodical
neglect to do the right thing is no excuse for
this obvious doing of the wrong thing towards
Colonel Templeton. He prosecuted and ob-
tained the conviction of two men whom the late
Government refused to toiith, after having taken
out warrants for their arrest. Had the Crown
Law department not taken out warrants and
tlien dropped them there might be some shuf-
fling excuse left open to the Attorney General,
who now declines, “after long consideration,”
to pay the expenses incurred by a private
person in the performance of Government duty.
Readers of The Bulletin don’t require to be
told again that the Premier Building Society
scandal was not confined to the cruel wrecking
of that institution, but extended over the whole
history of the trial which resulted from it.
Purves, Q.C., was a prime mover in the prose-
cutions, and although he ultimately became
counsel for the Crown it is quite generally
known that the prosecution was secretly cursing
his zeal all the time. Purves and his juniors
once stated that they would work for nothing
rather than have Colonel Templeton “let in”
by the Crown, and now the Crown is dishing
them out of that £4OOO, or some of it.

A Problem.
The New South Wales Parliament closed up so
suddenly last week that Jersey’s valuable
opening speech was practically wasted and
thrown away. No doubt, however, the poor,
little, washed-out oration can be boiled down
and used over again, and, provided Jersey
leaves out one conspicuously idiotic clause, it
will answer very well. This is the clause in
question :
Angry and evil feelings have been engendered between
men, although they have never had any personal cause of
quarrel, and a cruel weight of widespread misery has
fallen, not upon the leaders, but upon the helpless, inno-
cent members of the workmen’s families. A commission
has been sitting for several months past inquiring into
this difficult and painful subject.
No doubt the families of the workmen did
suffer through the strike, but the constant
inference put forth by the monopolistic
hypocrite that, because they suffered, the
cause was necessarily a bad one, is three-
parts lies and one part slimy idiocy. Can
anyone tell of any cause, good, bad, or indif-
ferent, which did not entail suffering on ‘ ‘ helpless
innocent families?” The early Christian martyr
generally left his wife and children to starve
after his death whereas if he had remained a
respectable pagan he might have lived and kept
them in comfort. Nine-tenths of the individuals
who have died for the glorious British flag have
left their offspring—when they had any—
destitute, and if they had let the glorious
British flag go to blazes this disaster might have
been avoided. Hundreds of thousands of
obscure, unnoticed individuals perished to build
up Britain’s colonial empire, and their deaths
entailed an untold amount of suffering upon
their families which would have been averted if
they had told the British royal race to go out
and throw green apples at itself and build up
its own empire. Hardly anybody ever
sacrificed himself for independence or
liberty or the freedom of religion or any
other noble cause without leaving his family
in the lurch thereby, but no washed-out
driveller rises to curse the famous Six
Hundred because they charged at Balak-
lava without the slightest regard for how
their children would get on after they had
been hashed up by the Russians, or abuses the
men who relieved Lucknow because some of
them got killed leaving their grandmothers
entirely unprovided for. In fact, anybody
may go and get slaughtered in the most
purposeless and idiotic way in the interests
of the most idiotic monarch alive, and he
will be held up to public admiration
even though he left 26 starving infants behind
him ; but if a labourer goes on strike, and his
family grows hungry in consequence, the case
is entirely different. His cause must be a bad
one because his family suffered on its behalf,
and yet almost every other man’s cause is a good
one for exactly the same reason, and.why these
things are no one can tell.
The Standing Railway Committee of Victoria
has bettered the present betterment principle.
It proposes the abolition of Government com-
pensation for land-severance, and will ask
Parliament to sanction the imposition of dif-
ferential rates against the landowners imme-
diately benefited by anew line— i.e., these
persons are to be charged higher rates than
ordinary, so as to make the railway at once
nearly burdenless to the State. The man who
declines to allow a railway to pass through his
land is to have his wishes ignored and must
look to the local authority for any compensa-
tion. If compensation is awarded, the com-
mittee proposes that the local authority should
be empowered to meet it by imposing a special
local rate. If Parliament declines to adopt
these suggestions, the committee is prepared to
resign en bloc. Reforms in railway details are
to follow these reforms in principles. All this
is decidedly cheering. If equal progress were
made in other directions, it would not be long
before it wouldn’t be worth any sane man’s
while to become a large freeholder in Victoria.
Graham Berry’s evaporated boast of “burst-
ing up the big estates ” is coming gradually
within measurable distance of its accomplish-

Dear Bulletin, — Is it not a singular fact that,
despite the general outcry in N.S. Wales
against dummyism, all attempts to suppress it
have hitherto failed? In no instance of prose-
cution has a conviction been obtained. The
clauses of the’9o Act relating to homestead leasing
encourage rather than decry dummying. The
powers conferred upon the homestead lessee, to
rent or mortgage his country from the very day
of its being gazetted, make the conviction of a
man for dummying almost a legal impossibility.
Until land is thrown open for selection under
more reasonable conditions, the hond-Jidt man
will continue to be crushed out by the monopo-
list, and dummies will increase and multiply.
In my opinion, the acreage should be enlarged,
the rent reduced, and the • conditions modified
before the bond-Jide man can hope to compete
with the rich employer of dummies. On the
station from which this letter is dated, there
are 13 homesteads; one assessed at 2d. per acre,
and the other 12 at 3d. per acre, while the
station only pays about 1 fib per acre. How
can a 10,240-acre man pay the ruinous rent of
3d. per acre, and hold his own despite natural
drawbacks—drought, rabbits, etc. ? The ’9O
Act is said to have been helped through the
House by men who connive at wholesale
dummying. It is a fact that not 10 per cent,
of the homestead lessees, who have obtained
their lands under the ’9O Act, could prove their
hond-fides if called upon to do so. The land is
being selected by hundreds who, so soon as their
five years’ period of compulsory residence has
expired, will quietly transfer their lands to the
holders of their bogus mortgages, from whom
they are now receiving 30s. per week and
rations,—Yours, H.L.
Considering that “ honours were easy ” in
that ponderous religious farce, the trial of the
‘ Lord ” Bishop of Lincoln for illegal ecclesias-
tical practices, there doesn’t seem to lie much
necessity for the congratulations which some of
the Australian Anglicaiis have effusively for-
warded. And it is not easy for a godless out-
sider to see what would have been gained if the
Loi’d Bishop had won, or what, except costs,
would have been lost if he hadn’t. The chief
conundrum submitted to the Bench was as to
whether it was lawful to mix water with the wine,
or whether it was better “neat.” Their Lord-
ships, after quoting many incomprehensible
authorities, which don’t seem to be of any use one
way or the other, came to the conclusion that
mixing the wine and water is like kissing the
choir-girls— no offence unless it occurs while the
congregation are looking. Upon the point
whether it is the ecclesiastical cheese for a
parson to stand with his back to the communi-
cants, the decision is that this is not illegal :
whether it is a sign that the parson afore-
said is ‘‘ no gentleman ” their Lordships
don t trouble to affirm. Another matter
gravely discussed was the habit that Lincoln
had of drinking all the wine that was left over
after the communicants had had theirs. This
practice was declared to be not unlawful, but
it certainly doesn’t resemble what is known
in cultured circles as “square dinkum.” It
was possibly on account of his not doing the
fair thing in this regard that the Bench
refused to give Lincoln any costs whatever.
Ihe case occupied nine days in hearing, and its
expanse of legal drivel of reported argument
and judgment would swamp about 120 columns
of nonpareil. The net result is that both sides
are landed for costs and otherwise are as they
were. But the Church owes them its gratitude,
for if it were not for these occasional ecclesias-
tical prosecutions the people would forget that
there was any State church in England, or that
there was such a thing as ceremonial religion in
the realm. The nation is reminded of the
Church whenever a big scandal or clerical
rough-and-tumble brings Christianity into
prominence.
Melbourne Age advances the old Tory iiyp<
thesis that “ anyone who refuses to honour the
Queen’s name (on her birthday) should remem-
ber that those who have no loyalty to existing
institutions are not likely to prove the most
reliable supporters of whatever may be substi-
tuted for them in the time to come.” This is
equivalent to stating that any Australian—
native or British-born—who protests against
the monarchical system, because he believes it
to be full of hereditary evils, would be always
sighing for a king if he were to shift his quar-
ters to America. That rooster will not fight,
David Syme. The man who hisses a bad show
is ever enthusiastic in praising a good one.
Also, the supposition that those who now gusli
over Her Gracious would prove the most loyal
supporters of a Republic carries with it the
assumption that they are either greasy time-
servers or out-and-out fools. The Age forgets
that it is constantly referring to the fiscal policy
of Victoria as an established institution. Then
why didn’t the majority which had abolished
Freetrade immediately turn round and vote
against Protection ? In short, why has any
order of things been improved upon since the
Flood ?
There is nothing valid in the sentimental
objections urged by Greer, M.P. (N.S.W.),
and men of his kidney, against the employment
of females in liquor-selling. If a woman
so engaged does occasionally hear coarse
language, on the other hand her presence
frequently—in fact, nearly always—restrains
men from loose behaviour and ribald talk.
Morality gains quite as much as it loses by the
employment of barmaids, and it is a gross libel
to assert that a girl is bound to fall if she
follows such an occupation. In extinction of
that slander it is only necessary to point to
many of our worthiest matrons, married to
foremost men, who at one time of their lives
deftly pulled the beer-pump handle and
smiled into the thirsty man’s glass. The
naturally-virtuous girl would be virtuous in far
more trying circumstances than she would ex-
perience in her position as barmaid. She would
still be virtuous as housemaid at a coffee-palace
inhabited by deacons and teetotal politicians.
Creer’s motion for the abolition of barmaids
takes for granted a number of scandalous and
foundationless assertions. Its wording, more-
over, is not restricted to barmaids—it provides
for the abolition of all female labour in hotels,
so that the cook, scullery, kitchen, and
chamber-maids, &c., &c., &c., would have to
vanish before this onslaught of the godly man.
Paragraph from Melbourne Age, printed under
the heading, “Peculiar Case of Theft.” We
quote it in full, because, as it stands, it has a
simple matter-of-course air which we could not
hope to reproduce in a condensed form :
At the City Court yesterday, Tiros. Aitkex, a well-
dressed young man, was charged on remand with having-
stolen a till from the coffee-shop of Mr. John Tilbotson*
on the morning of the 10th May. The police found the
prisoner in the street carrying the till, and suspecting
that ho had taken it from somewhere, took him into
custody on suspicion. They subsequently found the
owner of the till, who deposed to the prisoner having
been in his shop drinking coffee after 12 o’clock on the
night that he was apprehended. For the defence it was
contended that it had not been proved that the prisoner
had come into possession of the article wrongfully," Mr.
Paxton, P.M., said the majority of the Bench considered
the evidence was not sufficient to convict. It was probably
a foolish trick, and they hoped it would be a lesson to the
accused. In some of their midnight walks the vomw
fellows of Melbourne did things which a little more know'-
ledge of the world would make them more cautious over.
In this part of the world young men often obtained more
money than brains. The prisoner was then discharged.
Mr. Panton lias not spoken so prettily since
Lord Beerthirst came before him a long time
ago. He says that “in this part of the"world


young men often obtained (■sir) more money
than brains.” There would be nothing sur-
prising in this if brains had to be carried away
in a till—or rather a skull—by stealth at dead
of night. Otherwise, we fail to see the appli-
cation of the remark. But the majority of the
Bench who “ considered the evidence was not
sufficient to convict,” what genial humourists
they must have been ! If the fact of a young
man being caught in the street at midnight
carrying a till which he had taken away from a
coffee-shop, wasn’t sufficient evidence that the
till didn't belong to him, and that he was—not
to put so fine a point upon a vulgar theft as
Mr. Pa nton and his fellow-magistrates thought
right to do in this case —xfealiiifj it, we would
like to know what they would regard as suffi-
cient evidence ! We fancy they would have
had no doubts about the affair, and there would
have been no mention of foolish tricks, know-
ledge of the world, &c., if the absconder with
the till had been a poorly-dressed young man
without friends. But as the offender was the
son of a lately-deceased and highly respected
Melbourne potentate, lie was discharged with
good advice by these Justice Shallows, who
remembered their own youth and what terrible
fellows they were then.
Don’t let the N.S.W. electors forget for one
moment that if Parkes comes back with a
majority, to a certainty the Government will be
committed to the Draft Federal Constitution.
Parkes, Bruce Smith, and M‘Millan have now
said that the policy of the Government with
respect to Federation is defined by the resolu-
tions of which the Premier gave notice at the
opening of Parliament. Just here we will
quote the essential compilation :—
That this House re-afflnus its opinion in favour of the
federation of the Australian colonies ... it hereby
approves of the scheme for an adequate federal constitu-
tion embodied in the draft bill of (he Convention, but
reserves to itself the right to propose ommissions and
amendments to be fully set forth by the proposer in each
case in a schedule, and to be finally considered if deemed
advisable by another Convention.
Xow this, the Ministers repeat, and we repeat,
is the Government policy. But observe that
the Convention will only be appointed “ if
deemed advisable,” and the amendments and
omissions to be proposed by the Parliament of
the province are to be included in a schedule,
which may, “if deemed advisable,” be con-
sidered by another Convention. There is abso-
lutely no precision of obligation here, nothing
mandatory ; and if Parkes returns with a
majority he will carry his resolutions in spite of
any promise of unlike tenor and in the face of
any belief on the part of the constituencies that
the amendments made in the House are to go
before the next Convention as the sole con-
ditions on which X.S. Wales will join the
Federation. “Me must have a second Con-
vention !” were words never uttered by any
Conventionist till The Bulletin affirmed the
need of holding one. And r could be
more repugnant to the e ■ i.i.ffi Parkes
went into ah < came ’ ban the
holding of a revising, and p< vising,
and re-re-revising Conventions.
Labour Champions.
' v ' UI * LA.ui writes from New Zealand
K.Mviian Knglish paper what he thinks of the
ki-ht nr troubles in Australia, He girds at the
working classes for the “ insensate selfishness ”
with which, “ for the merest trifles, almost with-
out a reason for any dissatisfaction, they throw
themselves out of employment, inflict shocking
privations on their wives and families, utterly
dislocate trade, and throw the whole country
into confusion.” Charles says he has always
championed the cause of the workers, but now
he is utterly ashamed of them, when he sees the
follies of which they are guilty and the gross
and casehardened selfishness which dominates
their dealings. Untaught by experience, “ they
plunge afresh into the excesses which have
wrought their misery and hardened their hearts
against the sufferings of their own flesh and
blood. ” This same pity for the poor families of
the masses is always a strong card with the
spokesmen of the classes—during a strike. We
hear precious little of it at any other time. There
is no inconveniently excessive overflow of bene-
volent sympathy with the suffering wife and
children of the hard-working mechanic when
the labour-market is overcrowded, and “ the
sacred principle of freedom of contract ” is in
full swing, and work is scarce and wages are
dead low. The sufferings of his flesh and
blood come in for a very scant show of
capitalistic commiseration then. But once let
those very sufferings drive him to talk of a
strike, and a wave of godlike pity sweeps over
the land. A chorus of tear-broken voices
beseeches him to pause before taking a step
that will inflict misery on many thousands of
helpless women and babes, and utterly dislocate
trade. And if he doesn’t pause accordingly,
the disgust of the self-styled champions of the
working-classes finds vent in a long discordant
bray.
* # #
Now, how and when and where has the smug
and well-fed .Reverend Charles Clark played
the part of champion of the working-classes ?
What did he champion them about ? Was it
because they had something to complain of ? If
not, what did they want a champion for?
If it was, what did his championship
amount to ? How much was it worth ?
Did it right their wrongs ? Hid it win them
any privilege that was heretofore denied them ?
We could point to a good many noisy cham-
pions of the Labour Party who are always to be
found in the other camp the moment any
trouble arises. So long as the patient working
man puts up with his horse-like lot, he has a
horde of glib sympathisers to praise him for his
exemplary thrift and contentment and industry,
and to discourse finely about the dignity of
labour and the unfortunate inequality of social
conditions and the precious prospect in the
future—always in the dim and misty future—of
a new and lovely regenerate society, in which
all men are to be equal, and the human
rare will bask in the sunshine of universal
brotherhood and peace. We have met these
champions of the working classes before.
Whenever their hearers take them at their
word, and make up their minds to push a step
on the journey towards the promised land, the
doughty knight errants always get in front and
wave their arms wildly, and scream that the
road isn’t made yet, and that there are several
bottomless pits right ahead, and that the only
thing for the Labour army to do is to be good
and virtuous and do their duty in the station
of life to which it has pleased God to call them,
and that the kindly monopolist only wants to be
left alone to make a nice, broad macadamised
highway to the flowery land of the millennium.
The Rev. Charles Clark doesn’t approve of
the present tactics of the working classes.
Will he describe the tactics he does approve ?
Has he anything to suggest except that they
should go on patiently bonding their backs to
the whip as they have done any time the last
few years ? It’s a cheap game to find fault with
proposed methods of reform. You can’t size a
man up by the schemes be doesn’t believe in,
you want to know what he does believe.
*' ~ * *
Taking Clark’s letter as his text, another
individual who signs himself J. Trowbridge
Critohell writes-to the Pall Mall Gazette
to deliver bis soul of a wail on the gloomy con-
dition of affairs in Australia. “ Heaven only
knows,’ be says, “ what will become of Aus-
tralia, unless the working men there can be
brought to their senses.” Trowbridge is
mistaken. It doesn’t require omniscience
to know .what will happen unless the
working men are brought to their senses.
W e will tell him. The country will continue
to be run in the interests of monopolistic rings
and land-grabbing capitalists. Property votes
will increase and multiply, and manhood suffrage
will go on becoming a more and more trans-
parent mockery every day. Bloated, red-faced,
short-winded men with big gold watch-chains
will still be seen at the club dinner-table ex-
ploding in puffy indignation at every new exhi-
bition of the gross and casehardened selfishness
that dominates the dealings of the pampered
bricklayer or coal-lumper ; the yellow-booted
Treasury clerk will, as the years go by,
develope a more aggressive haw-haw in his
boasting description of the way the dis-
affected lower orders subsided meekly when
he turned out with a badge and - a
baton in the year of grace one thousand
eight hundred and ninety ; and creatures of
the J. Trowbridge Critohell type will speak
of themselves with a patronising air as haying
always been champions of the working, classes,
you know. All these things , will happen in
Australia unless the working men are brought
to their senses. But J. Trowbridge, etc., may
make himself easy. They are not going to
happen. The working men are coming to their
senses—by degrees.
The People’s Opportunity.
Sir Henry Pahkes has rushed the N.S.W.
elections, hoping, by swiftness of strategic manipu-
lation, to take his opponents unawares and return
to Parliament with afresh majority. Under pre-
sent electoral conditions, where Broadacres,
Mortar and Co. have a few dozen votes apiece,
while Thew and Sinew have but one each and are
often disfranchised altogether by reason of being
compelled to wander afield in search of means of
livelihood, a very large amount of success for the
proletariat cannot be reasonably expected. > Yet,
if the Labour organisations hold their forces well
together, and strike a united blow at the polls,
they should make a distinct impression on the
personnel of the next Parliament At present then-
chief danger lies in the self-importance of many
of their leaders, who seem to regard their
own election to Parliament as a matter of the first
necessity. Still, this is the beginning of a new
epoch in N.S. Wales. A large majority of both
parties are pledged up to the chin to support the
introduction of one-man-one-vote, which reform
will be the precursor of the real battle and victory
heralding the Government “of the People, by the
People and for the People. ”
* # #
By the end of next-week the elections for 35
constituences will have taken place and 75 mem-
bers will have been elected to the new Parliament.
For these 75 seats there are no less than §48 can-
didates —a fact which is eloquent in its own trans-
parent absurdity. With such a splitting up of
votes, no other result can be possible than a
general representation of minorities. In any such
representation the single voters must go to the
wall while plural voters triumph. It is to be
expected that many of the announced candidates
will be weeded out ere nomination dates, but, as
the first Dominations do not come off until Mon-
day next, it is useless here to indulge in specula-
tive prophecy.
* * #
Of next week's elections the nominations fall in
this order :—On 15th, 21 nominations; 16th, 5 ;
17th, 8 ; 18th 1. Besides these, for elections that
follow after next week, there are—on 17th 1 nomi-
nation ; 18th, 3; 19th, 9 ; 20th, 10. Nominations
later than next week fall—on 22nd, 3; on 24th, 13.
* # #
The absurdity of over-candidature is most
keenly defined in such electorates as—Morpeth,
with 13 candidates for 1 seat; Goulburn, 8 for 1
seat; Hartley, 12 for 2 seats ; Paddington. 18 for
4 seats ; Central Cumberland, 17 for 4 seats ; Cam-
den, 12 for 3 seats; Hawkesbury and Carcoar, 8
candidates each for 2 seats : Hunter, Shoalhaven,
Macquarie West, and Wellington, all single elec-
torates, with 4 candidates apiece.
Arthur Barton Paterson, solicitor, one of
the most cultured and talented of young Austra-
lians, will stand for Yass Plains in the democratic
interest. He is identical with no loss a personage
than the horsey-poet “Banjo,” whose “ Old
Pardon, the Son of Reprieve ” and “ Clancy of the
Overflow ” are known to all men. The Bulletin
hopes to have the pleasure of welcoming to the
new Parliament so bright and downright a son of
the soil.
At the time of writing, the newly-organised
N.S.W. Labour Electoral Leagues have accepted
the following candidates Central Cumberland :
Cook, Terry, Marshall, and Lennie ; Murrumbid
gee : Arthur Rae (Shearers’ secretary); Nepean:

A tremendous house, including twelve
rows of reserved stalls, greeted “The Gondoliers ”
on first night at Sydney Royal, when all the old
favpurities, especially thedivino William, received
warm welcome, the little man being quite
staggered with the warmth of his reception. A
rough passage over from Melbourne and lack of
rehearsal, caused tilings to go slackly, however,
and interest flagged so immistakeably on the first
few nights, at intervals, that it was rumoured that
the management had serious thoughts of getting
the “Old Guard ” or “Marjorie” ready for the
latter half of the season, but business, so
far, has been so big (money going away
every night from all parts of the house)
that rumour has, no doubt, rendered her-
self liable to action for libel. Gilbert-and-
Sullivanish pabulum is apparently an acquired
taste, for at first sight this opera was universally
voted slow and too quiet by those for whom G.
and S. had not catered for some months, but
their fare is toothsome, and the appetite for it
grows with that it feeds on, and “ The Gondoliers”
(now much better handled than on first night) is
gradually playing itself into public favour. The
overture does not strike us as being a very bril-
liant piece of composition, and none of the music
is particularly catchy, the chief favourites up to
date being Guiseppe’s “Royal duties” patter-
song; the matrimonial “Contemplative fashion”
quartette, and the gavotte quintette. Charles
Ryley's graceful dancing, easy style of vocalisa-
tion and shapely limbs placed him witli one bound
on the pinnacle of public favour, but he has
not, so far, as in Melbourne, been bombarded
with bouquets. Elsie Cameron (who, in appearance
and speaking voice, reminds, us of Effie Liston)
does the little she has to do in a fashion that
makes folks wish her opportunity greater.
Florence Young, with a good stage presence and
sweet voice, advertises herself as an amateur
every time she moves foot or hand, but she has
got lots of time, and apparently heaps of ability.
Elton, as big a favourite as ever, has only to open
his. mouth to get a roar, and his dancing is
universally reckoned a feature of the show. As
for the. “ tiny twins,”. Flora Graupner’s voice
seems to want a rest badly, but Violet Varley has
made big strides, histrionically and vocally, since
her last appearance at this house. So much
cannot be said for Syd. Deane, in whom no
marked improvement, in either direction, is
visible. Henry Bracy has not as yet been able to
do very much with Marco, though his “Sparkling
Eyes” song narrowly escapes nightly encore. A
stronger orchestra and chorus have been heard
in this house since the company last appeared
here. Phil. Goatchef’s Piaxzetta scene has some-
what dissappointed folks who had been led to ex-
pect a .scenic revelation from his brush, and
Brunton s Pavilion, though acknowledged to be
clever,'is voted more suitable for pantomme in
critical circles.
** * *
“ The County Fair ” is simply a chunk out
of New England life for whose full appreciation it
is necessary that- the auditor should have been a
student of Judge Haliburton and Miss Wetherell
and be thoroughly conversant with “Sam Slick,”
“ Queechy,” the “ Wide, Wide World,” and later
works of a similar character. It is difficult to
classify Neil. Burgess’s play; in the main it is
village-drama, but here and there an incongruous
farce element is introduced, while the concluding
and only sensation belongs to the region of melo-
drama. Sadie Stringham plays Abigail Prue—
tlie character originally impersonated by the
author in America—in ain angular, high-dried
fashion and rips out her garrulous nasalities
at such a rate that it is difficult to
follow her. She gets most of her laughs by
a liberal display of white flounce and shoe-strings,
and her fall downstairs attired in a bedgown only,
is most artistically hair-raising. Otis, handled
ably by Frank Currier, is a dry, old-fashioned,
reticent bean-pole, whose clothes fit him nowhere,
and who, despite his stage dialect, makes every
syllable clearly understood. The genial Currier is
likely to become a general favourite, and it is a
pity that “ The County Fair” does not afford him
better opportunities and does not give more
legitimate chances for the delineation of the novel
type of character represented by him and Miss
Stringham. Virginia Earl plays Taggs, a tomboy
Bowery-reared sort of creature, in a purely arti-
ficial style, and her chief success is made in a
song and dance in the corn-shucking, barn
scene. Roland Watts Phillips lias one of those
artless maiden parts which she has successfully
handled hundreds of times, and is as easy to her
as eating pie. Arthur Greenaway’s farmer
is bright, easy, picturesque, and free from his
usual tendency to monotone. Frank Harcourt
plays Hammerhead, a chuckle-headed, inferior
sort of villain, ably ; and Frank Ayrton’s jockey
is all right, though smelling more of the New Ciit
than the Bowery. The racecourse-scene on first
night secured a big ovation from a noisy and
demonstrative house packed to its fullest capacity,
but there is heaps of room for improvement, and
some contrivance—a ground-border, for instance—
is badly wanted to preserve the illusion by con-
cealment of the mechanism. “ The County Fair ”
is not, to our mind, much of a play; a man
recovering from brain-fever might turn out one
with a stronger plot, smarter dialogue, and better
curtain tableaux ; nevertheless, judging from the
laughter and applause of first night, it is destined
to have a long and favourable run.

“ The New Magdalen at Sydney Garrick
on Saturday night did not quite “ break the eel’s
knee.” Neither drama nor cast was new to Sydney,
and Oven the weather wept at the joint prospect
and furnished absentees with a conscientious
excuse for keeping away. Far-fetched in senti-
ment, the drama’s emotional ideality was never
vitalised. Janet Aohureh, as Mercy Merrick,
sometimes erupted into spasms of tortured
writhing, and flashed out jets of unsuspected fire,
but these errant beams were about as electrically
artistic as tlie gasps of agutteriiig-outcandlcwick.
Charles Charringtou s Julian Gray was a parsonic
nullity—a nou-bhamelconic study like nothing on
earth' or in the waters above and below the earth.
Mahcit Flemmin"' needs lessons in spooning
baby, if his efforts ufr Horace Holmcroft are
'tli m i.-.t persuasive lie can employ toward d
his best girl ; he never rose to even
.commonplace jealousy, and he kissed Mercy Mer-
rick as if she were his grandmother’s half-sister’s
aunt. Meta Pelham’s Lady Janet Roy furnished
the only dash of vivacity and light-comedy
sprightliness in the general tameness. Emma
Bronton, as Grace Roseberry, was forcible in
clamour and scorn, but her implacable and unfor-
giving hate was never magnificent. Yet a humor-
ous public insisted upon calling the principals
before the. curtain at every opportunity, and the
dramatist’s touches of high-falutin were heartily
applauded. “The New Magdalen ” was to have
been replaced on Wednesday by Pinero’s “ Money
Spinner,'’ introduced to Sydney’s notice by
Wyberc Reeve some years ago, and that comedy-
drama will probably be followed after a brief
season by “ A Doll’s House,” whose performance
at last Saturday’s matinee crammed the bright
little theatre to its capacity, all the stalls being
reserved and the gallery filled at two shillings a
head by undergraduates. The Women’s College
Fund has thereby benefited to the extent of nearly
£2OO. “ Our Flat ” goes up on the 27th.
H? » -:tf -;K-
“Jauo” continues to cram the Criterion
nightly ; if not the success of the theatre’s history,
it is certainly one of its greatest pecuniary
triumphs, and looks good for another month yet.
Nevertheless, prior arrangements compel its with-
drawal on the 19th, and “Evangeline” goes up on
the 20th. By the way, a message comes from Com-
poser-Conductor Rice to say that the Melbourne
management have been arrested for overcrowding
the theatre at a performance of his opera,

Melbourne Princess’s carried a full load
every night last week, nor was a seat allowed to
go begging at the “ Camille ” matinee. Two per-
formances of Dumas’ well-worn drama, four of
“La Tosca” and two of “Fedora” formed a
sufficiently severe test of the “star’s” powers of
attraction, and the phenomenal advance booking
for this current week of “Cleopatra” set the
managerial mind at rest entirely. Evidently the
lamp of Bernhardt will burn brilliantly in'Mel-
bourne until June 27, when the Gaiety company
will substitute leg for the legitimate, mash’em for
passion, gagedy for tragedy, and frisky wench -
ways for frisky French plays. There is so much
genuine delight in the great artiste—so much real
thunder from the amphitheatre, and hoorooing
from the stalls—that the few vacant stares dotted
around the circle are not worth considering. Men
in a certain “spear” must be present at such
functions, and to know that they suffer torment
between the refreshment intervals is some small
comfort for us of lower grade. But we
are irritated when we find that lords of
broad acres and “ shindycates ” contrive to
escape the responsibilities of wealth by linger-
ing behind the intervals, or, in some cases,
neglecting to come back any more. Alike as a
thing of beauty, a producer of sweet sounds, and
a mistress of lovemaking, Madame Sara has, up
to time of writing, won the largest amount of un-
qualified admiration for her Camille, on the first
night. She was more than usually nervous, they
say, and when Madame gets excited she keeps the
house tingling under the shocks transmitted by
that big battery of nerves which constitutes her
whole being. She is a pictorial triumph directly
she appears upon the stage with her arms ex-
tended like angels’ wings, or divine danger-
signals, expressing her gratitude for the applause
she seems to deprecate. Then she is such a deli-
cate, fading-away sort of Camille, and her voice
through each stage of the pulmonary affection
reminds one of the bells that the sexton sets ring-
ing for Sara when the evening sun is low. This
is' not vulgar and irreverent, we hope. If our
father’s son is low likewise it’s because his heart is
in the right place. When a subject is very
serious the world yearns for comic relief, there-
fore these ghastly jokes are allowed to drop
with a sickening thud into the middle of
the notice. Bernhardt varies much her aspect
and manner of speech with each character, seem-
ingly, so that her admirers might feast on
forty plays for forty nights without finding the
banquet monotonous. As Fedora, she is a nice-
looking, but not very juvenile princess, whilst her
La Tosca has an air of being young and winsome,
rather than lovely and alluring. True to the text,
she represents an operatic divaoi mountain growth,
who holds sassiety cheap—an amorous girl trans-
formed by circumstances into a tigress. After
becoming a tigress she reverts back to her original
state, during the short prison-scene with Cavara-
dossi. In her anxiety for her lover she seems to
forget that she has just slunk from a chamber of
horrors, where, in the mingled lights of wax-
candles and cold grey dawn, the corpse of Scarpia
lies with a crucifix upon its gory bosoni. Which
is perfectly natural, no doubt—anyway, the in-
fallibility of Madame Bernhardt as an actress is
good enough to abide by. Her “ make-up ” and
“ get-up ” are certainly open to occasional critic-
ism, however. If women admire all her costumes
in “La Tosca,” the men do not. They may be
high art, like Holman Hunt’s pictures, but one or
two of them are incomprehensibly ugly. Finally,
Madame is erratic in her treatment of her face for
this part. Sometimes the pigments are laid on with
a careless hand, as though she had been pushed for
time, and on these occasions the effect is more
patchy than pleasing. Metis, asscz lien, as we used
to say in l aris when we went on a Cook’s excur-
sion. The prevailing characteristic of the com-
pany is quiet— i.c., quiet as the race go—natural-
ness. They are not continental barn-stormers by
any means, and Munie, the chief comedian, doesn’t
invariably tell his funny stories to the orchestra.
The men, excepting Fleury, the jeun 'premier, are
apt to look old for their characters, and most of
them, Fleury very much included, are common-
place in modern clothes. But they are picturesque
enough in “La Tosca,” and will cut satisfactory
figures in the ancient historical productions.
Duquesne (the Scarpia) is a strong leading man,
and of several more or less young ladies Mme.
Jane Mea is the one for whom a fellow would
prefer to die if death were an unalterable clause
in the contract. This, as goes without saying, is
exclusive of Madame Bernhardt. They keep on
dying for her all the time, figuratively speaking.
It’s only fair. She herself dies to slow music in
every character.

“ Cleopatra ” has disappointed many high
expectations. Bernhardt is, in this instance, a
beautiful and costly show, and fine French taste
distinguishes many of the appointments, but it is
certain that the public looked for more solid mag-
nificence. Only the third scene, which is poetical
without being .expensive,;gained applause when
tile curtain rose on it.' Sardou’s work has
striking situations and occasionally rapid action,

yet it does not display Sardou’s abilities to the
full. The actress harps too often on one string,
and she herself says that Cleopatra is not a very
great part for her. On Monday night, for
the first time, she failed to keep the house
always under her spell, and the gods very
properly protested against those weary intervals
for which Sara is so famous, and during which
she ib supposed to be writing her memoirs on the
sliding roof of the Princess’. Dreadful cries of
“ Roll up, Sairey !” were heard, and the boys also
explained that Britons never shall be slaves, while
a spirit of unrest manifested itself once or twice
in the dreamy third act, when the low comedian
came on disguised as the heathen who brings news
of Antony’s marriage. His comic tones upset
some people’s centre of gravity, and the serpent
of old Nile looked angry, and exclaimed
“0, enough ! ” in the purest English.
Rumour had it that Sara afterwards grew
scornful in her dressing-room, saying that
folks who objected to long waits need not wait at
all, and some of them did depart without getting
their full money’s worth—they would not lose
their last tram even on Sara’s account. Never-
theless, the great artiste must have listened to
reason, for the two finishing acts were rushed
through in time to send everybody away by 11.30.
Cleopatra died of her live-asp bite in about 20
seconds, and the ending of this historical occasion
was as tame as the little snake. The
Roman portion of the company shone to
great advantage, looking their characters
in every case, and a surprise was given
by the Antony, who was impersonated by
a haughty, handsome personage named Darmont;
his acting is neither subtle nor powerful, but his
aspect accounts for his privileged position in this
particular bill. Every reserved seat is booked for
the week, and “Cleopatra ” will be put on at the
Saturday matinee.

“ Poor Jonathan,” an American version of
a Herman comic opera by tire “Beggar Student’s ”
composer, broke out at Melbourne Opera House last
Thursday. The inauguration of this novelty was
an apparently aimless enigma, but by Saturday a
real sense of humour had begun to struggle through
the gloom, and the reason of Jonathan’s success
in New York stole gently o’er the understanding.
Vanderbilt (a person much esteemed by the Yanks
on account of his inherited dollars) is here skitted
under the thin disguise of Yandergold, described
on the programme as a “ pessimistic millionaire.”
Jonathan is head cook to this morbid monument
of unearned increment, and gets cast from the
kitchen because he tries to fabricate toothsome
confections with a bar of yellow soap and make
delicious side-dishes out of night-lights. Vander-
gold, being biliously enamoured of a maiden who
holds off a little, decides to swap fortunes with his
discharged hash-brewer, and makes over his
wealth to that low-born idiot on the understanding
that they shall both die like dogs directly
either of them ehoses to sing a certain dreamy
melody. In the next act, whilst Jonathan is
wallowing in wealth at Monte Carlo, his bene-
factor turns up in a two-guinea suit and
endeavours to warble the song of destruction, but
his “ear” is at fault, and after wandering about
into several wrong keys he retreats, whereupon
Jonathan comes out again from under the table
and everybody goes on living as before. Finally
Jonathan and Yandergold resume their original
places. The millionaire, no longer pessimistic,
marries his merry maiden (she in the meantime
has figured as prima-donna to a gaudy im-
pressario), and Jonathan returns to the bar-of-
soap business with his wife, Molly, an exalted
scullery lady, who certainly made the “pieces”
fly during her interlude of grandeur. The idea
of the opera is distinctly Gilbertian, but the
librettist (or adaptor) has fallen a mile short of
that idea. At first sight, too, the spectacle
strikes cold to the male chiest in consequence of the
costumes —allowing for theatrical license—being
built on every-day lines, and nothing in the shape
of legs or ballet getting a show. But this objection
wears off considerably after a second visit. In
fact, “Poor Jonathan,” pulled together and
written up, might grow on the public
taste, if given a fair chance to take
root. The airs are tuneful and catchy
in many places, and the whole score is
respectable from a musician’s point of view. Also,
the company are settling down comfortably into
thsir parts, with the exception of Woodfield, who
represents the dyspeptic Yandergold, and has
little to do beyond trying to settle himself. Miss
Clara Merivale negotiates .all but the top notes in
good style, and her comedy, especially the eye-
play, is arch and pretty. Miss Ida Osborne comes
out well everyway as the promoted Molly, whilst
Leumane, after a tiring attempt to be funny in
his cook capacity, becomes a humorous Jonathan
later on. Moreover, his bit of mock-tragedy sug-
gests that Providence possibly intended him to
shine as Macbeth. There’s no telling. Snazelle,
with a new, bright variety of topical song, is the
beau ideal of an impressario, and the rest do
nothing in particular indifferently badly. Money
has been spent on the mounting, and spectators
who can overcome an impression that the supers,
came from the “first part” of a variety show,
will find some points in “ Poor Jonathan ” if they
search for the same.

At the Bijou they were to withdraw “The
Idler” on Tuesday, to make room for “The
Profligate.” The Prof, was an Idler in his time,
Satan found mischief for him to do, and his sin
rises up against him when he wishes to be respect-
able. The play is accepted as Pinero’s finest
effort thus far in his literary career.

The Royal and Alexandra manage to hold
their own against the Bernhardt boom. “Bridget
O’Brien” has another clear fortnight to rage away
at the former house before the Firm’s lease falls
out, and “ The Scout ” will last over Saturday at
the Alexandra, unless they start a new Wild
West drama, with even thrillinger effects, on that
date.

The return of the Halles to Melbourne
Town Hall lias not excited the populace in any
marked degree, and the enthusiasts who couldn’t
satisfactorily account for their emotion last time
seem now to have forgotten that life wasn’t worth
living unless “ the Knight and his lady ” were
Interpreting somebody’s loftiest conceptions.
Fashion is no longer a factor in the attendances,
and only the people who enjoy sonatas and so
forth are scattered amidst a large expanse of deso-
lation —the dead-heads invariably being well to
the fore. Lady Hall 6 and her husband make
glorious music when they choose to minister to
the multitude instead of to a cult—a cult that
never by any chance pay for their seats ; and
Mdlle. Fillunger, the vocalist, is a favourite.

Mr. Jude, a well-known song-writer and
“musical evening” entertainer, whoso name
advertises itself, was to open a season at the
Athenaeum on Monday last, and is sure to be
appreciated. He will revive memories of John
Parry and Henry Russell on five nights of the
week, but the Lynch Family Bellringers, long-
absent from Melbourne, have secured the
Athenaeum for a term of Saturdays. They started
ringing last Saturday, and had a great reception,

At the Waxworks there is a promising
novelty in an engaging young creature who sings
prettily, ties ropes round people, photographs a
list of names on her memory, and makes herself
agreeable all round—a bewitching monologuist, in
fact. Things are getting very toney at the Wax-
works nowadays, and a new sacred group, “The
Widow’s Mite,” is much more of a work of art
than one expects to meet in any gathering of
effigies. The music-halls are not much affected by
French play competition, and othe'r matters main-
tain their equilibrium.

The Darrells have quitted the Adelaide
Royal, finishing up a most successful season, from
a pecuniary point of view, with “ Potter of
Texas,” which was preceded, however, by that
tale of woe—“ East Lynne.” The Adelaide people
seem fond of the tearful and emotional sort of
thing, for they rolled up to witness it in large
numbers. The Darrells have gone to Broken

Sara Bernhardt’s engagement is based on
the assumption that she can, within a given
period, draw a larger proportion of the population
in Australia, than in any other country. A fort-
night has been the limit of her American seasons
in cities considerably more peopled than Mel-
bourne. As for England—well, we never heard of
Sara performing out of London (like the Christy
Minstrels), and her visits there are as short and
sweet as the angels’. The knowledge that she has
been, practically speaking, backed to beat her
record may inspire the actress to do ditto in an
artistic sense. Williamson, who has watched
Sara acting scores of times, said that he never
saw her so great as on the opening night at the
Princess’s.
At Poverty Point.
There is a rumour, which seems to be gaining ground,
to the effect that Alf. Blank is acting better than he used
to. Which possibly means that he isn’t acting at all just
now.
Lady Dunlo was playing Venus round the English pro*
vinces when she became Countess of Clanoarty., It is to
be hoped that she will stick to her lofty position and
improve a noble race. The late Earl of C. was generally
regarded as an idiot, and the youthful Dunlo is'anything
but dazzling.
A week of Sara Bernhardt must produce about £2400
befo 'e the managers begin to get a look in. At anything
below those receipts they look out, but it’s financially ail
j,he same to Sara.
01 arles Danby, of the Gaiety burlesquers, appears to

Everything is going wrong with poor Mrs. Langtry.
Latest advices tell how her stage husband’s moustache
dropped off in the middle of a pathetic scene, shortly after
which the drop-curtain refused to descend, whilst the
Lily was stuck in the act of registering a solemn vow with
the forefinger of her left hand pointing to Heaven. After
waiting a bit, she took down her arm and walked off,
Stanley’s American trip netted him £22,000.
Charles Clark lately denied Fiat he had written to
England denouncing “the selfishness of the Australian
working man.” Charles, after completing his Australian
show season, scoots with Fie dollars in the Lusitania, and
right here in the Middlesex County Times wo find a long
tirade against the workmen for going on strike “almost

Edward Terry, reputedly the “nearest” man in the

Lady Halid has trained a bullfinch to whistle a section

George Kignold’s rival as a beauty (the New York women
were divided into two camps over the pair), died in a
New York garret.
Sara’s garments are built round her, like Sardou’s

Jamraoh, the menagerie-importer, used to have great

with his thumbs, while an attendant smacked him over
the forehead with a crowbar - then sold him for £3OO.
Playing at London Strand many years ago, Jennie Lee
lost half-a-crown bearing the inscription “Jo,” which she
had kept hitherto as a mascotte. The coin turned up the
other day in Auckland, and it once more jingles in her
pocket. Some other versions of this yarn are in circula-
tion, but this is just as true as any of them.
The two Duvals, father and son, in “ Camille,” were, in
one sense, never so well depicted as by the Holloways,
with their wonderful resemblance. They reminded one of
the Brothers Webb, wdio used to make up for the
Dromios as perfectly as the Holloways did for the Anti-
pholi.
The Bernhardt books of the play are all flam, and the
press is much to blame for cracking them up. They don’t
give the text, only what is called the argument—a lot of
bosh. Y r et the covers say, “Only version authorised
by Mdme Bernhardt.”
The insuperable drawback to the Melbourne Royal
these times is the vestibule, lined with bars, past which
all the patrons have to go, save those of the dress-circle.
Coppin seriously considers gutting the whole scandal cut,
assimilating the house to the Opera House, Bijou, Prin-
cess, and Alexandra, where such things are banished —
shadows of the old era when the “ Vag-.” slaughtered the
Saddling Paddock. Here is the sole sinful reason why the
Royal has sunk to be the fifth Melbourne playhouse.
W, and G. are sure that Bernhardt’s hit will fetch over

You will see the journalist in the gallery, and the can-
vasser in the dress-circle.
“Next to the great artiste I sign with pleasure”—sc
wrote Sara Bernhardt in a London scrap-book, where bet
name followed Ellen Terry’s.
Concerts have been terribly overdone in Melbourne:
HallC and Neruda, Albus, Hutcheson, Burvett, Victorian
Orchestra, treading on each others’heels.
Miraculous women, of about the same age: Bernhardt,
Terry, Farren, Patti. When the operatic manager,
Lumley, arranged the pas dequatro, of Taglioni,Carlotta
Grisi, Cei ito, and Grahn, there was a squabble as to who
should dance last. Lumley: “ The oldest, please.”
Hennings and Goatcher have been whipping up the
scenery for Sara’s Theodora. No one comes up to John in
architecture, and Goatcher colours luxuriously. Bernhardt
has not been able yet to visit the Royal, Opera House,
Bijou, or Alexandra.
Bernhardt has acted three male parts with distinction.
The first is Pierrot, the second Zannetto, the minstrel
boy, in Coppee’s “Le Passant,” and the third one of the
young princes in Casimir Delavigne’s “Enfants d’
Edouard.”
A jocular letter from Bellew to an old Melbourne crony,
when he first took to the stage, led to the belief that be
was identical with the H. B. Conway then springing into
notice, but he acted as Harold Kyrle. He said he had
taken the name of his old friend jack Conway. As Kyrle
lie was the Osrio of Irving’s first run as‘Hamlet, 200
nights.

They are saying in theatrical circles that when a man

that he and she are enemies.
We read that “Mrs. Hector Wilson, of Vectis Station
nee Eugenie Legrand, was a fellow-pupil of Sara Bern-
hardt’s at Paris Conservatoire.” So! Eugfenie certainly
possessed many of the amiable traits popularly attributed
to Sara.

Fillis’s Circus is expected shortly in Australia, from

Thespian belief in the horse-shoe is universal, and even
theatres are designed horse-shoe form, for luck. Mrs.
Bancroft stuck up a gilt horse-shoe 2 feet long in her
attiring-room, London Haymarket Theatre, and they
figure in all playhouses.
Toole acted in three theatres one night—Surrevo
Adelphi, Sadler’s Wells. Had to change hastily in the
cab, from the clockmaker’s boy, in “ Janet Pride,” to
old Master Grinnidge, in “Green Bushes,” but whe’h he
got out the jarvey was frightened, wanting to know what
he’d done with that ’ere boy.
A week or two ago we hazarded a prediction that the
failure of the new London Olympic would drive Wilson
Barrett to Australia, and now it is definitely announced
he is coming. The fact is he got rated too high, for “The
Lights o’ London” and “Silver King” fixed his limita-
tion.
Sara has occupied the sumptuous, bronzy-papered
dressing-room fitted up for Nellie Stewart, and is in
raptures. As the flowers don’t bloom in the spring tra-la,
just now, they couldn’t furnish her with her favourite
big bowls of white roses, and the clinging stephanotis.
But she cries “ Vive Melbou-r-ne !”
Dr. Neild: “She is indeed divine.” James Smith :
“ What aje ne sais quoi!” Frank Stuart: “ What a—
oh!” Councillor Bill levers: “Just the same as in
Parry.” Williamson; “By jing, what a child she is!”
Fitzgibbon: “Sara, toi qui j’aime !” Garner: “Forgive
me, Jimmy, over Johnny Toole.” James MacM.: “Bet
you there’s more money in ‘ The County Fair.’”
When Jenny Lind first acted Alice in “Robert Le
Diable” there was terrific excitement as she clung to the
big stone cross, and Bertramo, the Mephistopheles, tried
to drag her away. A friend asked, “ Oh, what were you
thinking of at that time?” “Well,” said she, “I was
thinking how’ I’d trim my old bonnet.”
Thus an Anglican clergyman : “The splendid reception
accorded Sir Charles and Lady Hall6in Melbourne may be
regarded as a triumph of pure art as against the siren-like
fascinations of the unholy woman who is just now drawing
so many Melbournians within her meshes.”
Williamson and Garner’s placardy reticence over Sara
has been admirable, reminding you of Nat. Austin, ring-
master of Cooper and Bailey’s Circus. Nat. used to expa-
tiate with magnificent adjectives on each new-comer to
the ring until the last, when he threw up his hands and
simply exclaimed, in a despairing tone : “ R-Robinson !
The Champ-ion 1”
The quietude of Bernhardt’s style is quite startling to a
Melbourne audience. Williamson and Garner advised
Rignold, Warner, Toole and everyone else that they must
be more painty in Australia than London—colour thicker.
But Sara won’t walk an inch off the plank for anyone.

Paper.
O tame result! O’Callaghan,
For weeks we have been thrilled
With horror of the wretch who gave
To you an apple filled
With deadly 7 poison. Since the Strike
Deluded primal man
No apple-yarn made such a stir
As yours, O’Callaghan.
No incident throughout the striio ,
Bloody, and mad, and tierce
As many were, so wrung our heart,
So melted us in tears.
We heard with grief the deeds of men
Splashed with that evil chrism
The shuddering daily papers name
As the “New Unionism.”
We heard that labourers who called
Each other Bob or Jim
Seeing an Officer would cry
Profanely “ Joe !’’ to him :
We knew that troops had been received
With storms of oaths and howls
While in their hearing —insult dire—
Someone had mentioned “ fowls.”
We learned from various sources that
Machiavellian plans
Were being hatched, and dynamite
Concealed in billy cans ;
We read from documents secured,
After a struggle tough,
The writers wished to be supplied
With “ more of the same stuff.”
We heard about a scoundrel who,
Yet roaming earth unhung,
When others cheered our Gracious Queen
Put out his ribald tongue ;
And that damned miscreant who scared
The North out of its wits
By saying that the shearers yet
Would give the squatters “fits.”
These things were horrible, and we
Groaned audibly to read
Of each, but your affair was of
A more demoniac breed ;
They troubled us beyond belief
Yet nothing that we felt
Approached our anguish at your tale,
O miserable Celt !
One afternoon, as you strode dov/ii
The street, a joy to see,
In the full regimentals of
The Gym pie Infantry,
Some murderer a pippin on
H is coward hand outstretched,
You grabbed it and did eat thereof,
And then, poor wretch, you retched.
You took it unsuspectingly
And placed it in the chasm
That intersects your features, and
Chewed on till many a spasm
Shook your great frame —we here assume
That you are strongly built—
Then down you dropped, and up you curled,
And out you yelled—“l’m kilt!”
They gathered round you, pale, aghast
And trembling, one and all,
And everyone declared the deed
Was diabolical;
“Our special correspondents ” wired
To that effect—like birds
That hunt for worms, they saw a chance
Of several hundred words !
And some who felt the honour of
Old Ireland was at stake
Made preparations so that you
Might have a roaring wake ;
While others brought two doctors, who
At once hauled off their coats
And emptied you with stomach-pumps.
Filled you with antidotes.
With scientific skill they sought
To baffle Union hate,
And searched you through for traces of
Corrosive sublimate;
They tried for prussic-acid ; then,
Believing that you might
Have, after all, been only dosed
With modest aconite,
Prescribed for that, and, to make sure.
Full many a sped -fie
They gave you against cyanides,
N ightshade, and arsenic,
And, fearing that the venom might
Not have been one of these,
They did their best to shore you up
Against cantharides.
They thought of digitalis, and
For Indian hemp looked out,
“Precipitates” they grappled with.
And quickly put to rout.
In puzzling over what had brought
You near to Kingdom Come
There even flashed across their minds
The thought of Queensland rum.
But, finding that the Unionists
Were not, with all their faults.
So fiendish as to give you that,
They probed for fatal salts.
Carbolic acid never once
They let get out of view,
They meditated seriously
Concerning Prussian blue.
For spirits of salts they found a balm.
And, with perplexed brows,
Tried on a little thing of theirs
for “ Don’t-Die-In-The House
For morphia one might fairly say
That they were “on the job,”
While strychnine at the very start
Received one on the nob.
To show the murderer that ho
, Had not to deal with flats,
They made you safe and whole against
Tlu- fiercest “Rough On Rats;”
They slew all agents strong to slay
Or elephants or bugs,
And pulled you through, O’Callagh.n,
With stomach-pumps and drugs.
our comrades vowed to have revuige
I’or all you had gone through,
Upon the hell-hound who had wrought
_ His base design on you,
For (wery drachm of nauseous stuff
You topic that day, they swore
To have a fair Imperial pint
Of his false heart’s black gore.
1 lie main camp was surrounded by
Their most unfearing braves,
A ho straightway haled before your Led
Some guilty-looking slaves.
But all iu vain; the miscreant
You said, was not of these—
He had escaped to perpetrate
Yet further villanies !
Ah ! well, the press might warn the world
About the dread abysm
Society is being led
To now by Unionism ;
And well might law-abiding men
At every failure quake;
And mutter that our liberties
Are once again at stake !
We trembled then, O’Callaghan,
But nourished still the hope
A SUFFICIENCY.
TROOPER: “Come along!”
STRIKER: “What for?”
TROOPER: “I heard you hollerin’ out; ‘We don’t want no more Queen I'”
STRIKER: “Well we don’t, ’cause we got more’n enough already.”
That your most fell assailant would
Be surely brought to rope ;
We knew the long arms of the law
Would seek him far and wide
When once ’twas known what he had sought
To place in your inside.
We waited hungrily to hear
What devil’s mixture had
Been hidden in the pippin which
Made your poor iu’ards bad,
And now we know precisely what
Caused you to squirm and twist—
You’ve luoled yourself and us, but not*
The Public Analyst.
He says the apple was all right, ,
And, speaking as a judge,
Dedans your fearful poison yarn,
O’Callaghan, was fudge.
You’ve soared to fame by a mistake,
And made us spoil our “ wipes ”
With grief for—what? Alack, but this—
A Private with the “ gripes !”

W. G. Spence, President of the A.S.U. '
“In future, the people will select the candidate.;
for Parliament, instead of the candidates selecting
the people.”
A Melbourne child’s epitaph :
NELLIE MUNROf
Her little frame lies chilly
Beneath the green sod,
Her soul is a white lily
By the white throne of God.
Sometimes you can’t beat cross-examina-
tion for eliciting facts. When they were enquiring
in Melbourne the other day about the loss of the
Craigburn, a witness was asked —“ Where was the
vessel when she struck ?” and the answer came
short, sharp and decisive —“ On the rocks.”
John Hart, the Tasmanian M.H.A. just
re-elected for Deloraine, is locally known as “ the
Silent Member.” His longest Parliamentary
speech was made last session, during the debate
r.”.,0%“5f y ,Tjn,e ! ss ,8 HoS:
hushed itself into breathlessness at the unwonted
spectacle and thrilled with tremulous expectancy.
The orator rose to the occasion Mister
Speaker: I’m agen ’em all.” Then he sat down
and mopped his dank forehead with a bandana.
Miss Evelyn, going against the venerable
Ilurlbert, alias Wilfred feurray, for breach of
promise in London, read out of her diary in the
witness-box. Here is the purple patch about their
first ‘ Rode in ’bus to Sloane-street.
After shopping, got into ’bus going to West
Kensington, in which I saw a gentleman. An
inexplicable feeling seized me. It was as though
an electric shock passed between us, and as I
could see he was experiencing the same sensation
as myself, I was greatly agitated. He never took
his eyes off me. When 1 got out, Faust followed
me.” This Romeo is 64, and stout. Bearing in
mind, too, how sexagenarian Duncan mashed
M iss Knowles, it must be allowed that the gay old
birds are having their innings, becoming rejuve-
nated Fausts, without knowing it. When, oh
when, will Mrs. Grundy be turned into Juliet ?
It is not very likely, we think, that phono'
, . J , •Q, .i V i 1 ,
graphic w,Usreproduced from the cylinder, will be
valid in English law. In the first place nobody can
swear to the identity of a phonograph voice eon-
seqnentiy the wicked nephew, who was really cut
off with a shilling, might turn up after the funeral
with a mysterious ey inder bequeathing him every-
thing. He could talk uncle’s voice down the tube
for himself and get a crooked solicitor o s vear k
neard the old gentleman do it. Secondly the
disappointed relatives might oppose probate, on
the ground that any man who has a will drawn up
by a lawyer in order that he might speak it into
the telephone instead of signing the document, is
of unsound mind. Or that a man who delivers his
last testament extempore must be madder still.
No, the phonographic will can be never more than
a beautiful dream, legally speaking, and all idea
of forming a family circle round a sort of sewing-
machine, which will proceed to grind out legacies
and add codicils relating to the residue, must be
unwillingly abandoned. We shall never get be-
yond the dried-up old geeser in spectacles who
drones forth the bequests of his deceased client,
and bows to each legatee as his or her name is
mentioned. He is a rasping kind of institution, is
the will-reading lawyer, but there’s human nature
in him after all.' He regulates his bows according
to the legacies and gets almost emotional over the
big amounts, like a secretary reading the list of
subscriptions at a Benevolent Society’s dinner.
Mrs. E. S. Phelps writes: “There is an
indescribable something in a modest girl’s eye,
distinguishing her from the matron.”
The non-legal public is refreshingly tickled
by hearing “ that one of the reasons why the
N.S.W. Law Institute prosecutes Solicitor Henry
Scott Harden, is because it fears that Harden will
‘ pile up the costs’ against those whom the Trade
Protection Society, which he represents and which
is alleged to consist chiefly of himself, prosecutes.”
Also, because “the whole proceedings are calcu-
lated to bederogatory to the profession.” Which,
being interpreted non-legally, means that the
Institute is wroth with Mr. Harden for doing
legal work cheaply : for, since his costs against the
potted defendants would always be taxed by the
Courts, there can be, little or nothing in the “piling-
up” allegation. Though the Law Institute has
been “ moving in the matter for several years,” it
declares that it does “not desire to punish,” but
simply “have it definitely settled whether such
class of business is permissible.” The Protho-
notary is to enquire “whether Harden is solicitor
to the society, or whether he is simply solicitor to
himself.” The public doesn’t care a dump which
he is, as it wants to sec the monstrously privileged
legal ring burst up.
Men are digging trenches “by contract”
for Brisbane Waterworks Board, at from 2s. Gd.
to 3s. Gd. per day, working ten hours a day. This
is “freedom of contract.”
As Sir George Grey’s broad principles
wisely carried out would make a great Federated
Australia, so Marshall’s Tonic Nervine taken as
directed would give strength to all the enervated.
A Presbyterian minister examined in a
Victorian court lately, solemnly declared that he
didn’t know the meaning of the saying—“l’ve got
a head on me this morning.” Buir whusky, mon,
yon.
An old-time Sydney police-court solicitor
was “Jim” , to secure whose professional
services was the delight of the “talent” when
“in trouble.” But Jim had a little trouble him-
self once. Something about fees or clients-money,
or one of those things that cron up often as “In
re a Gent, one,” &c., &c. The Supreme Court
called up “Jim” to explain, and Jim’s explana-
tion was at once novel and successful. He had
just lost Ins wife and brought the whole of his
children, seven or eight in number, dressed in
sombre black, each with a white handkerchief
carefully displayed and ready for use, to the
Supreme Court. Alfred Stephen, Hargraves, and
Peter Faucett were on the Bench. Jim’s appeal
was pathetic. He hoped their Honors would take
into consideration his motherless babes and give
him another chance. This was the cue for the
kids, who set up an unearthly yell and flourished
the handkerchiefs. Sir Alfred sternly gave his
judgment, “To be struck off.” Hargraves, in-
clined towards mercy, went for “another chance,”
while kind old Peter Faucett’s heart went out to
the motherless children—he voted with Hargraves
and Jim was saved. Coming out old Bill Roberts
said : “Well. Jim, I never thought you could turn
on the tap so well.” “Go to ,” said Jim.
“ Had you been in my place”—but we won’t finish
the sentence as James did.
The Marquis of Lome and
the Princess Louise are, it is
repeated, “ willing to come to
Australia for the Governor-
Generalship.” The Bulletin
cordially wishes them and all
the other members of the Royal
family health, wealth and pros-
perity so long as they stay away
from here, and it hopes that
they will grow fat and increase
and multiply until, magnifying
to the proportions of a back-
block rabbit - pestilence, the
people of England offer
each for their scalps. But
we trust that they will all
be struck by lightning ere a
single member of the Mon-
archical brood is permitted to
infest Australia permanently.
Parkes boasts that he is
going to the constituencies on
the Eederation question and on
the Convention Bill. This is
more than he can do. Notice
a few “test” questions which
various political leagues intend
making a sine qua non each for
its own members’ votes ; Free-
trade Resurrection! sts, Free-
trade absolutely ; Protection
and Political Reform League,
protection; Good Templars,
prohibition without compensa-
tion ; Single-taxers, their own
sweet fad ; Labour Leagues,
labour reform ; Soeialists, State
nationalisation; All-sorts, one-
man-one-vote ; and with almost
everybody in favor of some sort
of Australian Federation, but
dead against the Convention
Bill as it stands. The more the
mixed-up situation is considered
the more clearly it becomes ap-
parent that the only reliable
method of ascertaining the
opinion of the people on Federa-
tion is by the referendum. So-
called representative govern-
ment is about the most un-
representative system under the
sun.
Lord Hartington was to have gone through
the ceremony of marriage with the widow of our
old friend Manchester sometime in Apri l . The
joyful event hasn’t been announced yet, however
Rev. Howard Macqueary, a priest of the
Protestant Episcopal Church of America (in com-
munion with the Anglican Church) lately wrote a
treatise denying the immaculate conception and
the resurrection. His Bishop, Dr. Leonard, of
Cleveland, appointed a Court of five eminent
ecclesiastics to try Macqueary as a heretic, and
that Court has just found him guilty—by a
majority of one! So that two of the foremost
Episcopalian authorities in America have judi-
cially ru'ed that the denial of Christ’s virgin-birth
and resurrection are not inconsistent with C. of E.
doctrine ! Dogmas are cracking visibly on all
sides.
The latest American perjury is about a
gentleman in Chicago whose skin falls off him
every year. About July his last year’s hide
begins to wither and break up, and presently it
comes away entirely, and for a week he has to sit
around in his flesh and bones, without any clothes
on, and with his vitals considerably exposed.
Then a new outside grows on him by slow instal-
ments, and he is all right for another 12 months.
This is regarded as very remarkable by the local
departers from the truth, but if they saw how
Parkes’ programme shrivels up every year, and
saw him shedding withered Bills and Acts of Par-
liament till at last he sits around with nothing on
him but a Dead House scheme and an “ h,” they
would probably realise that their phenomenon
doesn’t amount to much after all.

Before Melbourne Royal Society, Rev. J.
H. Read read a paper in which he adversely
criticised the style of Rudyard Kipling and com-

elegant diction of his own ghastly sermons!
Miserable wretch !

George Augusta Sala says, in a congratula-

or even in Brisbane, where the recipient now
resides :—“ Ever so many years ago, I was an
artist myself; and, old and purblind ns 1 am, I
hope that I have not altogether lost my love for,

one incomparable painting of his own —his nose.
A current mistake about Duncan Gillies is
that he rose from being an “ordinary” Ballarat
working miner. He was “a man of education
as Frank Clark sings—although he did work in
the mine with Peter Lalor, but Duncan was not
heard of in any way in connection with the
Eureka. Some friends gave him a start with a
big subscription, and shares in the Nelson mine,
which didn’t turn out much.

Mr. Hurlbert, who lias failed to disprove
certain allegations of obscene letter - writing,
brought against him in a disreputable breach-of-
promise case, is the smart Yankee who professed
to have seen the original Parnell letter. The

cock-and-bull story at the time, but now the man’s
character has gone—taking the mythical Parnell
letter with it.
When Tom Russell was N.Z. Minister of
Defence, says a Maoriland paper, a naval lieu-
tenant applied for command of one of the gunboats
on the Waikato. He was plainly dressed, and his
physique was not that of an Adonis, so Mr.
Russell said, “Well, you don’t look like a naval
officer.” His interlocutor calmly “ eyed over ”
Mr. Russell, who had as few claims to be called a
beauty, and said, “Well, you don’t look much
like a War Minister,” Russell shipped him at
once.
London Hawk says that A. L. Gordon’s
verses wei’o very poor «tuff indeed —a mixture of
sour Swinburne and bad Bret Harte. There is in
this perhaps a colour of truth, but, nevertheless,
Gordon wrote one or two purely original things
which, of their kind, a> e unexcelled in the English
language. Tell us of a better ballad than “Where
shall we go for our garland, glad at the falling of
the year?” Swinburne would not be half-an-
inch short of his present fame had he written
“ The Rhyme of Joyous Guard.” Robert Brown-
ing would have been a little taller had he been the
author of “ How we beat the Favourite.”
W. Kinnaird Rose, editor of Brisbane
'Courier, leaves for England shortly, and speaks
somewhat ambiguously of returning after a six-
months’ absence. Rose is a Scottish advocate
and a Queensland barrister, and is understood to
have been war-correspondent for the Scotsman
when “Fourteen-Flags” Maclver was serving
under General Ignatieff in Servia and Bulgaria.
„ Rose is a passionate lover of Burns and Milton—
rather a curious blend for even a Scotchman. He
is also credited with being deeply versed in
theosophy and esoteric Buddhism, and, when
patriotically engaged in preserving Hogmanay
from getting mouldy, he tells glowing anecdotes
of Madame Blavatsky, who has just departed to
thellenceness to see wdiet her her particular Nirvana
has been reached.
Says Mojicure Conway in the “ Open
Court”:—
In all matters relating to sex and marriage, Bradlaugh
was not merely chaste personally, but exceptionally con-
servative in opinion. Yet he was cruelly slandered in
relation to a refined and eminent lady. The gossip was
all the more cruel because, as I happen to know, these
two leaders of Freethought had deliberately sacrificed
their happiness for the sake of their example and the
honour of their cause. The lady had been driven out of
her home by her husband because of her heresies, was
legally separated, though not divorced, and left dependent
on her own energies for her own and her little daughter’s
bread. Bradlaugh’s wife had long been in an asylum.
Morally divorced, their union might have been pardoned
by society in any but so-called “Infidels.” Any intrigue
was impossible to either, so with love in their hearts they
continued apart to the last. In speaking of this matter
Bradlaugh once said to me: “If I know myself, I have
not a passion I would not crush like an eggshell rather
than stain the honour of ray cause.”
There are a thousand individuals in the
U.S. w’orth more than £200,000, while a good half-
dozen can boast of being the owners of £20,000,000!
The present fortune of the Vanderbilts totals to
the respectable sum of £50,000,000. Roekfeller,
President of the Standard Oil Company, has an
annual income of £3,000,000, or £BOOO per day. By
compounding this income at six per cent, semi-
annually, it will be seen that at the end of 25
years his fortune would amount to £160,000,000.
Astor’s income, which is even larger, would, at the
end of 25 years, amount to £175,000,000. Jay
Gould has £1,000,000 a year, so that in 25 years
he would be worth only £55,000,000. There are
36 individuals worth over £2,000,000, while there
are 87 more worth over £1,000,000. All of these
fortunes are, however, not held by men, many
women being high in the list. Mrs. Hettie Green
heads the list with £6,000,000, there being 15
others who own over £1,000,000.
St. James’s Gazette, one
of the howlingest organs of English
Toryism, wants to have flogging
re-established in the army as the
only means of putting down dis-
affection. The curious thing about
the Tory is that he always wants
flogging re-established in some
locality where it won’t affect him
personally. If flogging will pro-
duce a feeling of contentment in
the mind of asoldier, why shouldn’t
it lead to the same results in the
case of a Tory journalist, and if the
soldier's boss should be pennitted to flog him
when things don’t go smoothly why shouldn’t the
proprietor of the Gazette come down and
administer a breezy walloping to the editor of
that paper when matters don’t seem to be going
right ? Then the world would be edified next day
by noticing the difference between the views of a
Tory editor who had been whaled, and the same
individual in his former unwhaled condition. A
system of universal military service, with abun-
dant flogging throwm in, ivoiild convert almost
every Tory in England in one act—provided there
was enough flogging, of course.

GENTLEMAN wishes position, office. Salary no
question.
Should Women Vote!
We think they should ! Because a woman
has more good, hard, common sense than a man.
Because she makes less bluster about her rights,
hut quietly maintains them all the same,
and much better than a man does. Because
she don’t give thirty shillings for an article
that she knows very well she can get for
eighteen. Because she does not stalk loftily
from the counter without her change, because
the shopman is a bit reluctant about counting
it out. Because she will hold her money tightly
in her dear little right hand for two hours until
she first gets a receipt for it from the fellow
who made her husband pay the same hill three
times last year. Not any “ Just give you credit
for it ” for her. Women have the most brains,
and by all that is brave, self-reliant and sensible
they should vote and run the government.
They have the hardest part of nature’s tasks to
suffer, they labour harder than men and more
continuously, and with less complaint. Let a
man suffer a little toothache and he will rave
and scream and turn the world upside down,
but a woman will suffer ten times the misery
without complaint. A woman has to bear ten
times the physical strain that a man does, and
it is only natural that they should be more
prone to weakness, debility, liver complaints,
headache and such simple ailments which
though, perhaps, not fatal in themselves are
liable to terminate in serious disease if not
promptly checked in their early stages. Thou-
sands of women have been rescued from suffer-
ing and misery by a timely recourse to Clements
Tonic, a remedy specially suited to the ailments
of women, being specially suitable for anaemic,
hysterical, and hypochondriacal constitutions.
A lady well known in Parramatta, N.S.W.,
writes under date September 10th :—“ Sir, —
Four years ago I caught a severe cold which
settled in my head and chest, and caused an
incessant cough and copious discharge of
phlegm ; this brought on great weakness and
debility. After considerable attention and
doctors’ treatment, the cough was relieved and
finally cured, but the debility remained and
seemed to defy the skill of the medical men and
the power of medicine. I had no appetite, and
could scarcely eat a particle of food, and was
almost reduced to a skeleton, having entirely
wasted away. I had taken pints of cod-liver
oil, malt extracts, and other medicines with-
out relief, when I was recommended to take
Clements Tonic. I procured a bottle, and am
thankful to say that I immediately began to
improve; I could eat better, and relish and
digest what I did eat. I gained flesh every
day, and my strength rapidly returned, and
after six weeks’ treatment with Clements Tonic,
I felt a new woman altogether. I took Clements
Tonic six months ago, and have never had any
sickness since, and am only too glad to add
my name to your list of grateful sufferers.—
Yours sincerely, Mary Kellett.” And Mrs.
John Taylor, 24, O’Connell-street, Newtown,
N.S.W., says :—“Dear sir, —This is to certify
that I have been suffering from neuralgia and
debility for the last twelve months, during
which time I endured the most excruciating
pain. I tried many advertised cures without
avail, until I used Clements Tonic, when after
the fourth dose I got relief and after taking one
bottle the effect was wonderful. I shall recom-
mend Clements Tonic to my friends as a good
and safe cure, and would advise others suffer-
ing as I have done to use it.” Clements Tonic
is sold everywhere, but sufferers must be care-
ful to get the genuine as many injurious and
useless substitutes are frequently offered for the
sake of extra profit by unscrupulous vendors.

At this time of the year the hair is apt to
fall out, but, instead of wasting their combings,
ladies should send them to Mr. G. Van Brakkel,
82 King-street, where they can have them made
up, no matter how matted and tangled they may
be. Mr. Van Brakkel has also invented a won-
derful hair-restorer. It is composed entirely of
vegetable matter, therefore, in using it no fears
for ill-effects need be entertained. It completely
restores grev hair to its original colour.

The ugly religious “ precedence ” question
has again arisen at N.S.W. Government House.
Gov. Carington, following Wales’ precedent, gave
first place to Cardinal Moran, by right of the
latter’s “rank;” Gov. Jersey, it would appear,
declines to concur in this, and, like Gov. Loftus,
awards first place to the Anglican bishop. In
Governor Jersey’s private house he should be per-
mitted to do as he pleases ; in his official house he
should be bound by the fact that no Australian
State has any official religion. Nor should he, in
The Bulletin s opinion, ever consider an ecclesias-
tic’s personal “rank,” as “ rank ” is easily manu-
facturable by any sect in the race for the head of
the table. Official local seniority should determine
all questions of precedence, and should the head
of the Jewish Church, oi% for the matter of that,
the head of the Particular Baptists, be senior, he
should be accorded precedence. In any case, it is
most disgusting, considering Biblical example, to
see alleged Christian gentlemen squabbling over
such a matter.

The luckiest people in Sydney just now
are said to be the crowd interested in the Last
Call mine at Croydon (N.Q.), which, up to date,
is being described chiefly by the aid of the
adjectives erstwhile owned by Mount Morgan and
(in its turn) Taranganba. The new thing—based
on the effects of an alleged thermal spring—is
absolutely believed in by those concerned, and
their faith is fortified by the favourable opinions
of Mr. Mark Hammond, who has been there and
seen for himself, and of a well-known Victoriar
mining-expert. One or two of the people “in
it ” have of late been somewhat below financial
water-level, and if you had looked in on them
recently during the wet Weather you would have
found them moodily resting their feet upon the
office-table, while their coats were drying before a
feeble fire. But now the order of the day is tall
hats, cuffs down to the second joint of the thumb,
gold-mounted walking-sticks—and they tell you
the time of day with saucer-sized, gold stop-
watches. The holder of each original share (£l5
actually paid) is entitled to consider himself worth
£15,000.

The young lady, not unknown in Govern-
ment House circles, who, late the other evening,
performed an Irish jig outside a fashionable Sydney
restaurant, with so much spirit and abandon, to an
appreciative audience of naval and military
officers, is earnestly advised to go for the variety
stage. Johnny Sheridan will jump at her.

Last Saturday, after the dissolution of the
N.S.W. Assembly, an ex-member, travelling on a
Sydney tram, when asked for his fare lovingly
pointed to his “pass.” His next neighbour, when
asked for his fare, pulled out his gold chronometer,
mildly asking the conductor if “ that would not
‘pass’ him?” The “member” then had to
“part.”

A man came thumping at the door of
Government House, Melbourne, the other day,
and told the Jeameses to fetch out Lord Hope-
toun, as he wanted to ask that young man why he
had condemned him (the angry individual) to be
executed at 10 o’clock next morning. “ Can’t you
see I’m hopelessly insane ? ” enquired the man.
As he seemed a little that way, they said “Cer-
tingly,” and hid behind the door until'a policeman
arrived. A policeman always turns up just as
things are getting funny at Hopetoun’s establish-
ment. Only a few days before the condemned
prisoner came there was a lofty sort of lunatic
who buttonholed Secretary Wallington and de-
manded “the privileges and distinctions of a titled
aristocrat.”' “ What are they ? ” said Wallington.
“ Bed and tucker at the expense of the country —
just as if you didn’t know ! ” said the lofty party.
He was run in, although there were letters of
introduction sticking out of his boot.
While Jackson v. Jackson shows how a
spouse can kick up her heels, Stephen v. Stephen,
in Melbourne, shows how a Mr. Jackson, divorced
from Mrs. J., has to pay for her keep after she
has married another man. This is too low down ;
it amounts to keeping the new husband.
Coroner You], of Melbourne, observes that
“ if a man shot at everyone he found in his house
at night, the result might bo that he would even-
tually shoot his daughter’s sweetheart.” If they
were taking a last tender farewell in the dark, it
would be difficult to put a bullet into Adolphus
without winging Angelina, we fancy.

The Bulletin hears that a newly-married

A certain Australian Tramway Co. employs
detectives—-technically known as “ spotters ” —to
keep tally of the passengers carried on certain
trips. The billet seldom lasts more than a fort-
night, as the first time the “ spotter ” reports a
greater number of passengers than the conductor’s
trip-slip records, there is an enquiry, and the
“spotter” being “spotted” by the tramway
employes, his usefulness is over; whereas, the
first time he reports a lesser number he is incon-
tinently dismissed as incompetent. The Bulletin
hears of a “spotter” who broke the record by
keeping his place for five weeks. He kept out
of troubled waters by stealing a glance at the con-
ductor’s trip-slip at the end of each journey and

she is down by the ’ead an’ won’t steer, and he’ll be blow’d if he can make

we present gratuitously to those who aspire to

A fearfully practical man advertises in a
Victorian paper :
\v OUNG GENTLEMAN wishes to correspond with a
Young Lady, with a view to matrimony. After-
wards, to go on a station for two years as a married
couple.
We should say, on a rough estimate, that the
advertiser is Scoatch, ye ken. If he had been
English he would have married her without going
into particulars, and then he would have hauled
her away to be a married couple on a station just
the same.

Yet another stone has been erected in
honour of Burke and Wills. This makes the third
now in Melbourne —but why all for Burke and
Wills? The inscription tells of no one else. What
about Gray and others who lost their lives in that
ill-fated and mismanaged expedition which came
to grief chiefly because Burke was so execrable a
bushman ? The business reminds one of the marble
erected over one of England’s generals by his
grateful country (he died much respected, of old
age). The grateful country quite forgot to erect a
stone to the memory of the brave fellows who fell
in the charge that made his name.
A noteworthy trophy of the Salvation
Army died in Melbourne last week —a woman
who murdered another with a hatchet, 20 years
ago, was sentenced to death, but received a com-
mutation. She had no friends when liberated,
about four years ago, but the Army took her up,
and she became a remarkably useful and kindly
officer in a humble capacity.

Alice Cornwell, so the cable says, is again
at work in London on the Largs Bay (S.A.)
Harbour scheme, but it is extremely problematical
that anything will come of it. Princess Midas,
The Bulletin is sorry to hear, has lost most of her
money through unsuccessful speculations. ’Twas
ever thus with women in business. Her first coup
with the Midas mine made her rich, and at once
all sorts of more or less doubtful Australian ven-
tures were thrust upon her by so-called friends.
If the Princess had stuck to mining—which she
understood fairly—it is probable she would have
come out right, but she dabbled in all sorts of
things—land, timber, electric light and newspaper
ventures, and dropped money in nearly all of
them. Poor Princess !

An old-time lawyer’s clerk tolls us a little
incident of the borrowing career of a certain dis-
tinguished (N.S.W.) legislator—who once waited
upon Mr. William Barker, a well-known solicitor,
and effected an exchange of cheques to the amount
of £lOO. The solicitor’s was, of course, met, but
the legislator’s was, like many others, returned
“N.S.F.”- The clerk was sent morning after
morning to make demand for the money but with-
out avail. The legislator went on a stumping-
tour, and in his first speech managed to speak of
“ his distinguished friend, Mr. Barker, one of
the ablest lawyers in Sydney, 'whoso advice in law
or polities I have always sought,” &c. An early
post brought the distinguished legislator a pleasant
note from Mr. Barker “ Dear , don’t mind
that little cheque; we will consider it settled.
Yours, &c., .”

Munro’s proposal to enfranchise all rate-
paying Victorian women has been received with
much applause at Toorak, as is only natural in
the case of any scheme enabling every wealthy
Tory to magnify his influence at the poll by con-
ferring a cottngcVupon each of his nearest and
dearest family relations in consideration of their
solemn promise to vote hard aginst the working
man. Lovely woman requires even less induce-
ment than this to plump for the candidate who
seems most “superior,”, and has the highest
instep, the instep, in such cases being, perhaps, a
stronger testimony to moral rectitude than soft
white hands with filbert nails.

Five new barristers and eleven new
attorneys were “called” at Sydney Supreme
Court last Saturday. How these people will man-
age to exist is indeed more than a mystery. The
Court has lately struck off the rolls an attorney or
two for permanently pocketing clients’ trust funds
and there such matters have ended, though were
a layman the culprit the criminal law would have
been invoked. People are now beginning to en-
quire whether the Law —the State—when it makes
a man “ an officer of the Supreme Court,” should
not solidly guarantee his honesty—or make him
find solid security therefor himself.

The imprisonment of Ellen Jays for
“ fortune-telling ” robs Sydney of the imaginative
genius of five well-advertised and well-patronised
personages—Ellen Jays, Madame Cora,” Mrs.
Lacey, Mrs. Wallace and Madame Lennox.
Judge Docker seemed to be silently grieved
because the Act under which the prosecution was
brought compelled him to sentence Jays to a year’s
imprisonment for the picturesque offence disclosed
in the information, but hinted that there were
esoteric crimes masked by this ostensible calling.
This at once suggests the question : If Ellen Jays
kept a disorderly house and was a decoy of the
most infamous kind, why not honestly prosecute
her for her alleged crimes ? Why advertise for-
tune-telling as a superstition important enough to
be suppressed ? Like every other superstition, it
is a matter of “ blind faith ’’—which is interpreted,
according to taste, to mean eithcrblind gullibility,
or an obedient, unquestioning and conscientious be-
lief in supernaturalism. And the State is not sup-
posed to interfere with “individual faiths.” The
clergyman who tells you that under certain condi-
tions you will go to Sheol and accepts money for
trying to keep you out of Sheol is guilty,
logically considered, of a graver offence than is the
old woman who tells the young woman that she
will marry a young man with blue eyes and have
eleven children.

As a matter of human experience, the
broad rule may safely be laid down that every
woman of 30 years of age, who has had the oppor-
tunity, has, at some time or other, had her fortune
told (generally scores of times) by either profes-
sional or amateur diviners —professionals for
choice. Fortune-hearing is the darling supersti-
tion of the feminine mind, which can always
furnish you with a list of wonderful instances of
miraculous prognostications. Notwithstanding
the constant recurrence of the fair man who is to
woo, and the dark woman who is to be a source of
jealous danger, and the long journey over water to
be shortly undertaken, and the long separation
from, but subsequent reunion with the Apollo
of her heart—the feminine belief (we now
speak of all women, from the Judge’s
wife down to the tobacco-twister) can’t be
shaken; whether these portents are read in the
lines of the hand, or by the disposition of cards,
or in the sediment of a teacup, or by trance-clair-
voyancy, or anyhow, or nohow. The old heathen
auguries from the entrails of a slaughtered beast
were not more reverenced than are the modern
babblings of glib and*shameless fortune-tellers.
# # *
It is not worth while to attempt, and it is
impossible fully, to put down this silly feminine
fetish. With each prosecution like Ellen Jays’, a
fresh stimulus is given to the fortune-telling en-
terprise. What is required is that where the
“ dens of the mystic ” are veiled hells of vice and
vortices of entrapment, the law should fearlessly
prefer the serious charges necessary to deal with
the odious crimes said to be perpetrated therein.

They say now that woman’s spitefullness

A Melbourne publican condemns the “jug-
trade ”as a source of misery and vice. He says—
“ If the publicans would unite and refuse to allow
so much jug-trade we would take the first step

almost noble, until the gentleman goes on to
explain that the jug-trade doesn’t pay.

PROSELYTISM BY POST.
What sweet and pious guile !
This note suggests, almost
A new Salvation Style
Of Proselytism by Post.
Eor any one can seize
At once—it seems to us —
The possibilities
That it contains. As thus
You spot a man of wealth
You say, “ His sin is Greed,
His spiritual health
Is pretty bad, indeed.”
And, being poor yourself,
Without the least remorse
You rob him of his pelf,
All for his good—of course !
And with it start in style
A little business, say,
And, in a certain while,
Grow rich in your own way.
Then, through the post (it’s best)'
You send it back, you know,
But not with interest —
And write him as below :
“ Dear Sir, —This life’s a sham !
I was a man depraved,
But now, thank Gawd, I am
(0 sound the trumpet !) saved.
“ The coin you’ll find herein
Uf you I did deplete—
Repent, 0 Man of Sin,
Hell yawns beneath your feet I” 1
This ought to make him dread
The rich man’s future grim :
If, when you write, he’s dead—
Why, all the worse for him.
Thus you may when you die
Remark, though sinners carp,,
“ I’ve done fny duty by
My neighbour—pass the harpT”

Consumption v. “ Microbe
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co. Gentlemen,—]
wish to add my testimonial to the many others as
I have been suffering- for the last twelve months
with lung disease. Have tried all medicines for
the lungs, but all failed to do me good, and I have
been with doctors for a long time; but I got
weaker every day, and my doctor told me my left
lung was no good to me, and that I should never
get any better. I got that weak I believed I could
not live long in such a state, but was recommended
to try your Microbe Killer, and ever since I have
been improving ; in fact t the change is wonderful.
I have taken one jar and part of another, and I
begin to feel quite strong again. I believe a few
more jars will make a certain cure of me. I
recommend it everywhere I go, as I know the
value of its use, and will be glad to give anyone
information who likes to see me, as I believe it
will cure all diseases ; not only that of the lungs,
but all if taken in time. I am yours truly,

has returned in perfect health and strength, and

Because we think of then,

Gov. Hopetoun “honestly believes that
his residence in Victoria lias added 20 years on to

For absent was his wife,

To his prospective life.
Stay on, melud ! Keep up your “ larx ;”

One of the little Miss Jerseys performed
the ceremony of christening the baby monkey at
Sydney Zoo the other day. It is well, under the
circumstances, that the Governor, the li tie lady’s
father, does not come to N.S.W. with delegated
powers as head of the local Anglican church,
otherwise the monkey-christening announcement
might lead to misconception.

During the progress of a now famous
recent N.S.W. divorce-case (in which no moral
misconduct is charged and the unravelling of the
Gordian knot is sought on legal grounds only) a
learned Q.C. repeatedly referred to the priest who
gave evidence as to the celebration of the marriage
as “the co-respondent,” much to that genial
cleric’s disgust. The Court smiled consumedly,
and the erring Q.C. excused himself on the ground
that “ he was not so accustomed to the atmosphere
of a Divorce Court as his learned friends.” Some
queer definitions were elicited during the trial :
“ Your father was a R.C., I believe, Mr. ?”
“No, sir, he was not.” “ What was he ?” “He
was an Englishman.” A female witness was
asked “ Whether So-and-so was a young man ?”
“No.” “ Was he an old man ?” “Yes.” “What
do you call an old man, then ?” “ Why, a man in
the prime of life, sure.” Another witness, who,
two previous witnesses had sworn, had knelt at a
font, cheerfully asserted the contrary. “Do you
know what a font is ?” asked his Honor. “Yes.”
“What is it, then?” “It’s the steps in front of
the altar.” The same witness swore that “he had
never seen Jones alive at any time subsequent to
Ins death, at least, not that he remembered.”
In connection with the approaching Laun-
ceston exhibition, at the head whereof is Joubert, a
prize of ±llO is offered for the best inaugural cantata,
not to exceed 100 lines, on Tasmania, and if the
successful poet be a Tasmanian, the prize will be
made ±ll5. The successful poet is pretty sure to
be a Tasmanian. The peaceful little island is
about the only place iu Australasia where every-
body has a hobby and is free to, collect grubs and
write verses. The busiest man iu the busiest
street of Hobart is always ready, in his busiest
hours, to courteously and exhaustively discuss an
original stanza or a new species of worm with the
most absolute stranger.

It is cabled that the British Admiralty
thinks it unsafe for the newly-built ocean-going
Australian Auxiliary Squadron to go to Australia
via the heaving seas of the Leuwin. That such a
thing should have been published in Sydney is a
ghastly disaster ; for almost every little boy on
the shores of the Beautiful Harbour would be
quite ready to sail his canvas dingy round Cape
Horn in mid-winter.

Incorporated in the motto of the N.S.W.
Womanhood Suffrage League are Tennyson’s
lines :
These lines cut both ways, and are rather stronger
as an argument against Women’s Suffrage than
for it.
SARA’S CRITICS.
FIRST: “Well, what do you think of her - isn’t she lovely?”
SECOND: “Don’t know yet, can’t see enough of her.”
The prospectus of the North Sydney In-
vestment and Tramway Co. is denounced in Lon-
don by the Financial News. The company’s
balance-sheet, if you have a hard look at it, is a
most interesting document.

“ Bara Bernhardt’s little dog was,” says

The other evening a bank manager at
Toorak gave a dinner-party, and among the guests
were another bank manager, a parson, a building
society directoi’, and a sharebroker. They were
.smoking cigars, and passing round the flowing
bowl, and having a high old time generally, when
suddenly the host’s small boy gave a yell of
delight from his seat beside the window, and
vociferated “Oh, pa, there’s a p’liceman coming
in at our gate!” Then .a sudden coldness fell
upon the company, all except the parson. The
host nervously put the lighted end of his cigar iu
his mouth and swallowed nearly a foot of hot
ashes, and then he seized a small dog off an
adjacent chair and tried to pour it into his glass,
evidently under the impression that it was wine.
The other bank manager turned ghastly pale and
hurriedly put his burning cigar in his pocket, and
solemnly emptied a whole decanter of port on the
table-cloth. The sharebroker rose suddenly to
his feet and made an unaccountable break for the
door, but when he was halfway across the room
lie seemed to recollect himself and came back in
an embarrassed sort of way, and sat down but
missed his chair and lighted on the floor instead.
No one seemed to notice him, however. The
building society man seemed all at once to lose
the thread of an anecdote he was tolling, and
began to make strange and unaccountable asser-
tions. “It wasn’t the influenza, after all, as it
happened,” he said huskily, “ only a pol'eeman —I
mean only a cold, so I put my head in gruel and —■
I mean I drank the bed and sat down in the gruel
—that is, I ate a porous-plaster, of course, and put
my feet in the bank as security, and dep sited
the gruel to my credit, and next morning I awoke
in gaol—in a perspiration I mean.” Just here the
other bank manager began to combust visibly
owing to the cigar in his pocket but no one paid
any attention at all. Then the boy at the window
suddenly screamed again: “Oh, pa, it isn’t a
policeman ; its only a postman ! ” and all at once
the four men woke as if from a horrid dream, and
the sharebroker arose from the floor, and the
burning banker extinguished himself, and the
host gave up crowding the dog into his glass, and
there was a great calm. But they all looked side-
ways at the parson, and the parson looked hard
at the roof.

The Californian Indians, we read, used to

Drunkenness appears to be terribly on the
increase in the female division of Sydney high
society.
* * *
A N.S.W. editor is wroth because folks
don’t rise to their feet and remove their hats in
public places when “God save the Queen” is
played. The Bulletin goes further still. It is
indignant that they don’t haul off their pants and
substitute kilts, in recognition of the “widow’s”
Scottish proclivities.
* * #
At high-toned English weddings it is hoav
regarded as the correct thing to drop that old,
improbable statement that the bride will “ obey ”
her husband, seeing that she has long since given
up all intention of obeying him, and the law has
decided that she isn't called upon to do it. She
confines herself, therefore, to the naked assertion
that she will “ love and honour ” her fellow-con-
spirator, though even that looks a rather sur-
prising announcement, and he adheres to the
ancient fable about endowing her with all his
goods, though he knows that he really wants to
annex her goods, only her father won’t let him.
Also, they both state that they will hang together
till death, which is altogether too unlikely. Still
those anomalies will doubtless be removed some
day, now that the reform has once started, and
sooner or later the agreement will be fixed on a
plain, hard basis. The sentiment and the astound-
ing snake-lies will be knocked out of the service,
and the solid facts of the case will be crowded in
ins! cad. Then the parties will simply state that
they intend to stick together, barring unforeseen
accidents; that they will love and honour each
other so far as the circumstances allow ; that they
won’t make any rash promises about their goods ;
that they will cleave together to a reasonable
extent, and that they will be oneas far as possible,
Too much metaphor and too little reliable fact are
just the things that are wrong with the marriage
ceremony, and when these are put right it will be
as good a ceremony as anybody need want.

The two principal actors in the latest
N.Z. story were a member of Miss Jennie Lee’s
Dramatic Co. and a barmaid who dispenses smiles
and liquors at the principal hotel in one of the
big cities of the South Island. He fell in love
with Hebe. She, everyone believed, was just as
“gone” on him as he on her. They became
engaged, the marriage-day was fixed, and numbers
of friends were invited to the breakfast. The
“boys,” intent on giving the fair one a good
send-off, lavishly furnished the hostelry with
flags and greenery, the ring was bought, the
parson waiting; but, at the last moment, she gave
out that she was only having a lark, and that he
was not the man the Fates had set apart for her.
He has since sworn a vendetta against all bar-
maids.
* * »
The Age truly remarks that the profession
of licensed victuallers condemns them to see much
of a peculiar and by no means elevated phase of
life, and leaves them quite unconscious of the
great forces which are moulding society. Yes,
they mostly consider that the machinery of the
world is worked by beer-engines, and their notion
(jf the popular spirit of the times is the stuff that
happens to be in most demand at sixpence a
drink. As for barmaids —well, did anybody ever
try to draw one out on such mundane matters as
Capital and Labour, or Land Nationalisation?
Hebe is not fond of political economy, although
on broad (not to say suggestive) principles she
prefers Capital to Labour. She is not a keen
judge of capitalists, mark you, but still she likes
the chappie who wears a flower in his buttonhole
and never seems to do much during the week.
But the seedier fellow, who wears no flower
and steadfastly refrains from doing anything at
all, is her heart’s best love, as a rule.
* * *
English society, according to the London
Star, has resolved at last to drop the term “ lady ’
for good and all, and the English lady of the
future will be a woman—only that and nothing
more. When will Australian “ sassiety'” go and
do likewise? The difference between a lady and
a woman is har’d to define; and somewhere in
between the two classes comes that indefinable
individual commonly described as a “female,”
who is generally too shabby-genteel to be a woman,
and too thin and-shrill and socially obscure to be
a lady. Perhaps the handiest definition of the
three classes is this : a lady is a woman that lives
in a villa, and has wine and a fat husband who
swears; a woman is a person who lives in a
timber cottage and chops her own wood ; and a
female is either of them who lives in lodgings and
has a tendency to religion mixed with cats.
Things are a good deal confused, however, among
all these sorts and conditions of humanity, and if
one of them can be abolished it would make things
a good deal easier.

Judge Manning’s (N.S.W.) judgment in
the Fischer bankruptcy case is to no inconsiderable
extent an indictment of Mr. B. R. Wise’s Bank-
ruptcy Act. It also contains a very graceful and
Well-deserved compliment to the plucky lady con-
cerned, with whom The Bulletin sincerely
sympathises in her misfortunes.
The woman’s cause is man's ; they rise or sink
Together, dwarf’d or godlike, bond or free.

10 THE ELECTORS OF NEW SOUTH
WALKS.
Gentlemen,- Sir Henry Parkes pledged himself
to submit the Draft Bill of the Convention for
your approval. Jiis supporters have wisely forced
him to abandon that course, and to appeal to you
upon an abstract idea—a mere platitude—“ federa-
tion or no federation ; ” an issue upon which
nearly all on both sides of the House are agreed.
He has sent one unfounded telegram to the Pre-
mier of Victoria that he had got the approval of
the Legislative Assembly to that unjust measure,
a measure fraught with danger to every great
right of the Australian people, and particularly
unfair to the people of New South Wales. Now
that Sir Henry Parkes is face to face with you,
his masters, put it out of his power to send another
imaginative telegram to the Premier of Victoria
claiming that you have also approved of the Dra't
Bill because you are in favour of a just federation.
Leave no room for shuffling. Get straight answers
to straight questions. May I respectfully suggest
three questions which every candidate should be
asked : •
1. Are you opposed to the Draft Bill as it
stands? Yes or no.
2. Are you opposed to the powers ovt r money
bills it gives to the proposed Senate? Yes or no.
3. Do you pledge yourself that any scheme you
approve of will be submitted to the people?
Your faithful servant,
G. 11. REID.

The waterbury watches.
are so cheap that anybody can afford to own
one. A watch, however, to be cheap must be ser-
viceable ; it must be both accurate and reliable,
and in all other ways perform the functions of a
first-class timekeeper. In these particulars the
wonderful Waterbury Watches exactly “fill the
bill.” There r ore, because cheap, do not think
they are only toys or “ good enough for children.”
They have all the traits of the best makers, and as
they add to these unusual strength and durability,
besides cheapness, they are essentially the watches
for the mechanic, the farmer, the clerk, the work-
ing man and woman —in a word, The Watches
for the People.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Parkes-Barton. Coalition ahead.
Parkes and promises. Dibbs and deeds ?
Muzzle-loader v. magazine-rifle ; Workers’
vote v, allotment-vote.
Sir Thos. M Tlwraith has declared against
one-man-one-vote. That is Ills political epitaph.
Queensland Parliament meets 30th June.
The Government is at its wit’s end to raise
money.
Question for prohibitionist candidates :
How about the future of the great Australian
wine-industry?
Candidates who do not run in the straight-
out Democratic interest are candidates on behalf
of the Employers’ Union.
At the British elections of ’B6 there were
Scotch illiterates in the proportion of 1 to 74,
English 1 in 64, Irish 1 in 5.
Ex-Commissioner Good-chap retires from
politics—firstly because he finds he is no politician,
secondly because of ill-health.
Vote for the t flicially-chosen Labour can-
didates. The plural vote can well take care of
the Employers’ Union nominees.
Parkes: “ No Australian Parliament can
touch a letter or a comma of the Convention’s Con-
stitution Bill.” But any of them can put a full-
stop to it.
London Financial News advises the
Imperial Government not to allow British trust-
funds to bo invested in Australian Government
securities.
Parkes abandoned Freetrade for the Con-
vention Bill; now he abandons the Bill for
Protection, which he calls “ Freetrade and
Federation.”
A noGceable N.S.W. general election
feature is that almost every Single-Taxer who
has written a letter to the newspapers is a candi-
date for Parliament.
The question is whether in a Parkes-
Barton coalition Turveydrop could keep the Attor-
ney-Generalship. If so, where would Toby be ?
Colonial Treasurer ?
R. A. Price, a “ straight ” man from the
toenails upward, is out again for Gloucester, where
he was defeated at the last N.S. Wales’ general
election by seven votes.
Reynolds remarks that one feature of the
American Constitution is unfortunately absent
from the Australian Commonwealth Bill— i.e.,
the clause forbidding titles.
The N.S.W. Ministry gave but ten
days between the dissolution of Parliament and
the metropolitan elections. You can’t ripen eggs
to election-point in ten days.
Parkes now refuses to go to the con-
stituencies on the Commonwealth Bill,; but should
lie get a majority he will claim that N.S.W. has
accepted that Bill holus-bolus.
This time the pastoralists to a man will
vote with the Government. They will not lose
sight of the labour-question, which is to them a
matter of monopolistic life or death.
Parkes was wise to force a dissolution.
To let Parliament die a natural death would have
been easy, but a N.S.W. shearers’ strike might be
a very awkward introduction to a general election.
Parkes, the fox of many tricks,
Pipes his trebly tabor;
Labour is in politics—
Politics in labour.
Let it never be. forgotten that Parkes,
when he first proposed Federation, held forth, as
one of its advantages, the establishment in Aus-
tralia of a magnificent Court, presided over by
Royalty.
Parkes' plea for holding the metropolitan
elections on Wednesday instead of Saturday is
that “ the Jews must be considered.” That’s the
curse of it. Parkes has always had to “ consider”
the Jews.
There are 304,000 electors on the new
N.S.W. rolls, which means, with 141 members,
one representative to every 2865 voters. One
Man One Vote would make a wonderful altera-
tion in the totals.
Two candidates forfeited their deposits at
the recent Tasmanian elections—Duggan, in South
Launceston, and Falkiner, at Evandale. The
latter, who was the former member, only polled
45. votes out of 513.
Burnsby Horns, Parkes’ ex-Treasurer?
speaking, on 18th May, to the electors of St-
Leonards, announced himself as opposed to One -
Man-One-Vote. Yet Parkes bunches him with at
the general election !
Sydney’s Customs receipts for the first five
months of ’9l were £812,377, an increase of
£70,571, over the corresponding months of ’9O.
What a lovely and consistent free trade port
Sydney is, to be sure !
Lo; pcally or illogically, there is the fact
that the N.S.W. Freetrade Party is the capitalis-
tic party. The. Australian Freetrafle party is the
capitalistic party. Look at the men, go over their
names, and then deny it if you can !
Some Sydney papers are wasting space by
printing inconsistent speeches by Parkes in
parallel columns. The Bulletin vainly searches
for something really interesting—two speeches in
which Parkes does not contradict himself.
It is stated that an order lies in the
Railway Commissioners’ office, Sydney, for the
discharge of 300 men, but that this order is not
yet being acted upon, in view of its probable anti-
Parkes influence on the pending elections.
The Tasmanian Government will almost
inevitably have to face a want-of-confidence motion
shortly after the meeting of Parliament, which
will take place this month. Both political parties
claim to have secured a majority at the late elec-
tions.
The Chinese in Victoria have decreased in
10 years from 12,123 to 8137, and the aboriginals
from 780 to 584. In 1881 there were in Victoria
9049 uninhabited houses; now there are 17,461,
and yet there is many a man who has no place to
lay his head.
Bishop Webber (C. of E.), of Brisbane, calls
‘ the Church ” “ the greatest of all labour unions.”
Which church? And what is the amount of the
entrance-fee—we mean, the pew-rent? St. John’s
Cathedral, Melbourne, recently put the entrance
tax at £25.
During 1890, the N.S.W. Government
service was reduced by 560 officers in the name of
economy and reform ; and was increased by 1071,
in the names of their brothers and cousins and
uncles and patrons, and for the sake of efficiency.
Total increase, 511.
The Age, speaking for Victoria at next
general election, declares that Duncan Gillies shall
never again hold office as a Minister of the Crown
in Victoria. Brave words ! But, then, the poor
Age couldn’t even keep Hancock out of Parlia-
ment for Collingwood.
“Federation and Freetrade is the em-
bodiment of a lie.” — Traill. “ For N.S.W. to go
into federation with the other colonies, four of
which are actually pledged to Protection, is not to
allow Freetrade to take its chance, but to hand it
over to be slaughtered.”—S.M. Herald.
Premier Munro “trusts” that Gov
Hopetoun “will be the first Governor-General of
the dominion.” What does Munro mean by
“trust”? Is it a new land-fake or an auction
boom? And what’s the matter with “Common-
wealth ” that he should dub the future union a
“Dominion ”?
The N.S.W. Freetrade Association plat-
form, it will be noticed, does not, like that of the
Labour League, provide for the abolition of the
Foreign Agreements Validating Act, which, as
may be seen from the history of the Queensland
strike, is one of the greatest scourges that at
critical times can be applied to Labour.
It cost about £5O to repair the seats, &c.,
of Sydney Protestant Hall after M‘Millan’s meet-
ing. It was endeavoured to get the pretty Cen-
tenary Hall, York-street, for the meeting which
followed, but the management thereof knew too
much. The rents of Sydney halls are expected to
be doubled during the general election campaign.
The Foreign-trade press is sarcastic about
Dibbs having no policy to disclose, and points
proudly to the definite policy disclosed by Parkes.
If disclosing a policy were everything, Parkes
would be an archangel of a Premier. He is never
at a loss for a policy to disclose. Disclosing a
policy is merely giving a political p.n., to be duly
dishonoured and sued for.
What is a true labour candidate ? The
candidate who, whether from the ranks of manual
labour or not, sympathises with the wage-earner
who has to keep a wife and children on less than
£2 per week, and who is prepared to make per-
sonal sacrifices to get him a higher wage-rate and
a greater purchasing power at the expense chiefly
of the monopolistic and hoarding classes.
Up to date, N.S.W. Minister of Justice
Gould is the only unchallenged Parliamentary
candidate. —
Call it “ goold,” or call it “ gold,”
’Tis the same old story told ;
Rags or raiment, “ run of Dover
Be it dirty, be it clean.
Still the same result is seen
Gold secures a free “walk-over.” : t
“ Parkes’ action in making the election in
the constituency of the leader of the Opposition
five days later than anywhere else, so that if, by
any chance, Dibbs lose his seat he can get no seat
at all, is the most petty instance of malignity on
record on the part of any man pretending to be
great.”— Traill. Yes, especially considering that
under like circumstances, Dibbs treated Parkes in
a generous and even chivalrous way.
Premier Munro suggests that if per-
mission were given to a voter who had property in
more than one place to choose which place he
would vote iu, it would facilitate the passage of
the one-man-one-vote bill through the Victorian
Legislative Council. Very likely. But in this
matter no concession must be made. The
principle of one-man-one-vote is that not Property,
but flesh and blood alone, shall be represented.
Sydney Echo calmly says that, “ with the
exception of Sir Henry Parkes,” Sir George Grey
“is the only man w]uo could get such a welcome
out o>f hisp oWn province,” Now, when on earth
did Parke# oV any other man who has set foot cm
Australia, from the days of Ub Quire* down, ever
get such a welcome, in or out of his own province,
as that lately ekteifded to Grey in Australia?
Pkrkes is not personally popular, and; never was.
A regnpfcable thing is that the N.S.W.
Labour party has no daily paper and no patient
self-effacing organiser. It has no unselfish, whole-
souled enthusiast, content to drudge in obscurity
with the maps before him. All want to cover
themselves with glory in the open field. There is
no One able'and content to play Schnadhorst, like the
indefatigab’.emen who led the old Victorian Liberal
Party years ago, and in a single month made a
phalanx out of a mob.
For South Sydney r there are four seats
three of which were, until the dissolution, held by
strongly democratic Protectionists (Traill, Toohey,
and Edmunds). The Labour League has now
nominated two candidates which—should four
Employers’ Union candidates be put up, will lead
to four men’s votes being split among five, and
may possibly result in the ousting altogether of
the democratic party from the representation of
South Sydney. Some arrangement should be
made.
George Black, one of the parliamentary
candidates selected by West Sydney Labour
Electoral League, is an excellent, all-round
journalist, a convincing platform-orator, and a
close student of political economy. Mr. Black
has long been attached to the staff of The Bul-
letin, which tries to be modest when speaking of
itself or staff, but which, on the present occasion,
sees no reason why it should refrain from com-
mending to the favourable notice of electors a man
of Mr. Black’s vigour, ability and democratic
sincerity.
With that delightful cocksureness which
is his special characteristic, B. R. Wise said
recently that “ Nowadays the word ‘Liberal ’ in-
cluded freetrader, and they would no more call a
man a Liberal who was not a freetrader than they
would call a man a Christian who did not believe
in the existence of a God.” This reminds us that
John Bright once asked an American if Greeley
still “clung to the idiotic doctrines of Protec-
tion? ” Another American who had heard of this,
meeting Bright afterwards at dinner, found an
argument on tariffism inevitable, and opened the
ball thus; “Well, Mr. Bright, when I talk on
protection with a freetrader, I always begin by
admitting that I am an idiot.”
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. Richardson, lies
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while transferrable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away or
given as security, while bearing interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £lO upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 6 months, 6
par cent.; 3 months, 5 percent. But special rates
can be procured for longer or shorter periods.
The Bank on fixed deposits allows for 3 years,
per cent. ; 12 months, 8£ per cent. ; 6 months, 7t
per cent.; 3 months, per cent., and during the
last four years a bonus of 1 per cent, has been paid
to all depositors in addition to the current rates on
their deposits. This is the only Bank in Austra-
lasia that thus divides its profits.
Give the London and Sydney Tea Co. one trial.
They guarantee satisfaction.
THE VERY BEST
A single pain is often the fiist indication, and
tlie last throe, in one, of a physical climax, and
the climax is death. That St. Jacobs Oil has
again and again wrought its miracles just in the
nick of time, has bridged over (lie critical
emergency, and lias
SAVED MANY LIVES
at the point of death, is fully attested by the
record of many extraordinary cures in which this
fact of saving life is duly set forth.
If to its remarkable virtues in the permanent
cure of chronic cases of Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
Lumbago, Sciatica, after years of endurance,
wherein everything else proved valueless, fortunes
were spent in vain, and crutches and crippled
limbs were the manifestations, is to be added its
supreme sovereignty over pain, even unto death,
it is wholly entitled to the appellation of
THE VERY BEST.
Its specific action is especially adapted with a
curative penetration and soothing effect to arrest
any pain at the acme of its worst influence. St.
Jacobs Oil applied externally is now known as the
best specific to arrest the fatal tendency of any
aggravated pain.
A MOST REMARKABLE CASH
can be cited in proof, which is thoroughly verified.
It is in its main features taken from a leading
Liverpool journal as follows: “Two years ago, ’
states Mr. William Buchanan, residing at No. 8,
St. John’s-road, Kirkdale, Liverpool, and twenty-
four years in the service of the Cnnard Steamship
Co., “ I was taken down with a most excruciating
pain in my head, which was followed by
ONE YEAR OE TORTURE.
All physicians believed that it would lead to
softening of the brain and death. Six of the most
eminent attended me; but gave no relief. Iliad
to be held down, and my screams were heard out-
side. My case was deemed incurable. My wife
procured a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil, and applied it

Jackson’s Second Wife:
A SOCIAL SKETCH.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
JagksoN had been crying on his way up to Tap-
kins’ house. But even without the evidences of
weeping, Jackson would have presented an aspect
of abject woe as he stood nervously an the edge of
Tapkins’ verandah.
Jackson was pale and thin and sunken-eyed;
and certainly looked 35, though yet barely 30.
But hard work and a disposition to make himself
miserable on the slightest provocation had fixed
upon him the mark of the additional five years,
which he did his best to preserve by never looking
happy—not even in a moment of forgetfulness.
He had come about his wife, and this it was that
made him hang about at Tapkins’ door undecided
and half ashamed of his errand.
He was helped considerably out of his embar-
rassment by the sudden and unexpected appear-
ance of Tapkins, who, in evident surprise,
exclaimed : “ What!- you, Jackson ?”
For reply, Jackson’s face took on a sickly grin,
which really meant nothing, and must only be
taken as Jackson’s apology for being at Tapkins’
door. For the next moment his countenance
assumed an expression of utter desolation, and he
blurted out:
“My wife left me last night; she went back to
her mother’s!”
Now, though this desertion of his wife had been
a terrible blow to Jackson, and had caused him to
give way to tears, for very shame, every time he
had thought about it—which was very often—
during the 24 hours that had elapsed since her
flight, it is a fact, that, as he made the announce-
ment to Tapkins, he experienced a manifest sense
of satisfaction in being able to impart a piece of
information, of such tragic consequence to him-
self. And he had come to Tapkins in his distress.
Tapkins was a short, perky little man, with
round protruding eyes, who bestowed his friend-
ship upon Jackson in a patronising kind of way,
since he (Tapkins) was a retired di’aper, and Jack-
son, a grocer, still carrying on in a small way.
Jackson had but recently married a second wife,
a young woman who had given up school-teaching
for housekeeping and the collateral advantages of
a ready-made family, which she doubtless felt she
was specially fitted to manage by virtue of her
experience with the children of the State. From
housekeeper she had been promoted to the position
of wife and stepmother, but it Avas evident that
the “ place did not suit.”
Jackson had brooded over his trouble all day,
till at last he could stand it no longer and Avas
obliged to commune Avith someone. So he had
come to Tapkins.
It gave Tapkins a positive pleasure to listen to
Jackson’s story. They had had a few words—■
Jackson and his Avife— and she, “getting nasty,”
had shamefully deserted him, leaving her husband
helpless, Avith four small children. It was enough
to make a man cry— or curse. And Jackson, being
a weak-minded man, had cried.
“ And she took the baby Avith her,” the latter
added in conclusion.
Tapkins had listened throughout Avith the rest-
less imj ati mce of a Avater-dog waiting for the
thrown stick.
“Well, now, do you know what you have to
do,” he said to the miserable, long-faced husband,
“Avhen she comes back —and your Avife Avill come
back, you needn’t be afraid on that score —just
you give her ” (it Avas terrible to hear Tapkins
swear) “ a d d good hiding, and tell her to go
back to her mother, or stay—as she pleases.”
There Avas more practical good sense in Tap-
kin’s cold-blooded advice than will, perhaps, com-
mend itself to the mind of the serenely Christian
reader. It Avas difficult to get the iveak and tin-
ner A'ed Jackson to enter into his friend’s vieiv of
what was the right course to pursue Avith the re-
calcitrant Avife, and more particularly Avhen the
question of its physical, not to say moral, practic-
ability came to be considered from Jackson’s
point of vieAV. But by dint of energy of manner
and an unbounded enthusiasm in the virtue of his
plan and specious arguments that made Jackson’s
self-respect the point in question and at vital
stake, Tapkins finally Avon him over, and ho
returned to his Avifeless homo a much more deter-
mined man than Avhen he set out from it, an 1
filled with a stern resolve to make his wii'a
“ smart for her little holiday ” Avhen she returned.
A Aveek later, exactly falling in with Tapkins’
prediction, Jackson’s Avife returned. It Avas
toward the end of the day, at dusk, that she
walked into the store, Avith her baby in L?? arms.
Jackson at the time Avas weighing out sugar for a
customer who stood by intently watching the
operation. The husband looked, if anything,
more sunken-eyed and pale, and, Avithout doubt,
more miserable than ever. His eyes were weak,
and red —but he had not been crying ; not since
Tapkins’ instruction to him as to hoAV he was to
treat his wife upon her return —should she be so
audacious or so repentant. That injunction
revolving daily in his mind, as a duty to be per-
formed, had given to him a firmness that saved
him from an occasional snivel. And he had gone
about his shop-duties, and Avashed and dressed
his children each morning Avith a quietness of
purpose and preoccupation of mind that Avas a
matter of constant wonder to his eldest child.
And now his wife had returned. She smiled
good-humouredly towards him as she passed up
the shop. He made no sign of recognition in
response, but only looked at her —he Avas like a
spectre standing in the shadoAv—Avith solemn
melancholy. His hands trembled very much, and
he fumbled most stupidly with the scales; and
when the customer drew his attention to the fact
that he was using the half-pound Aveight instead
of the two-pound, he smiled and feebly apologised,
and took up the quarter-pound in rectification of
his error, till he discovered this new mistake,
which he corrected again Avith humble excuses.
It was not for some minutes after the cus-
tomer had left him alone in the shop that
he turned towards the glass-door opening
on the little parlour behind the shop, and
into which his wife had retired. Within
that room a duty lay before him, not an agreeable
one, it must be admitted, to Jackson of all men.
But for days he had been nerving himself to it.
Tapkins’ injunction weighed upon him with de-
pressing effect as something that must be done.
“ He must teach his wife a lesson,” he kept on
urging to himself.
He was now at liberty to follow her into the
room. But he thought he would go to the shop-
door and look up the street. He did so with a
secret longing that a customer might be coming
along, and so save him. There was no one in
sight, however, so he was obliged to go in and per-
form his part with his foolish wife. He walked
hurriedly towards the parlour-door, trembling all
over, and his throat choking—though not with
rage.
H e turned the handle, and before him on the
opposite side of the room, Avith her back toAvards
him, his Avife stood munching a biscuit that she had
taken from the chiffonier. She faced round as the
door opened, with a smile—ready prepared—upon
her face.
She was not the woman whom imagination
would have pictured as being drawn by love
towards a man of Jackson’s stamp. She was
young and good-looking, with large, mild blue
eyes, and a decidedly pastoral figure, that is,
it was full, if not round. She appeared more
youthful than her years. Her face was that of a
great schoolgirl, but she was 24. She would have
been prepossessing, but for a look of evil temper
that expressed itself, when she turned her head
quickly, with an appearance of surprise.
“Well, Harry, you see I have come back again
to be a good girl,” she exclaimed, as her husband
stepped into the room. Then happened what
Jackson had determined should not happen, and
what perky, officious little Tapkins would have
forbidden in the most energetic terras. The wife
advanced smiling, with the baby in her arms, and
Jackson advanced, too, with a mollified smile—
and the two embraced; and five minutes later,
when the shop-bell rang, Mrs. Jackson said to her
husband: “Nevermind, Harry, you keep baby—
I'll go and attend in the shop.”
The next evening Jackson found his way round
to Tapkins’ house. When the latter entered his
front room he found Jackson sitting there grinning
privately to himself, and when disturbed in this
felicity by Tapkins’ voice he rose from his seat
with a broad smile upon his lank features, and his
sunken eyes glistening and blinking.
“What! You, Jackson?” was Tapkins’ greet-
ing. “The wife?” he added, with ironical en-
quiry.
Jackson nodded. “Yes,” he said, glibly, “she
came back last night, and we have made it up.” •
Tapkins seemed taken aback, then he recovered
and said heartily, “Well done, I am glad to hear
it. I hope you taught her a lesson ? ”
“ Well, I don’t think she will clear out again,”
Jackson evasively observed.
“ If she does,” Tapkins remarked patronisingly
in reply, “ remember my advice !”
Jackson returned to his house filled with con-
tentment and joy. Without doubt a wife, if she
wills, can make herself a power for immense good
or equally great evil, she can be an inspiration of
gladness, or source of the keenest bitterness and
sorrow. Here was Jackson, the smallgrocer,
HENRIK IBSEN (Author of “A Doll’s House,” &o.).
naturally a weak, nerveless creature, stepping out
on his way home as if he held the fee-simple of the
whole of the township in which he dwelt, and
why?—Simply because lie knew that when he
gained his home he should find a smiling young
wife comfortably ensconced in the rocking-chair
in his little parlour, or else, perhaps, tucking
some of the children into bed.
When after the lapse of a week, followed by a
fortnight, and then a month nearly, without any
display of her “tantrums,” Jackson concluded,
with much comfort of mind, that his wife would
give him no further trouble. In fact, on reflection,
he was rather glad she had gone to her mother’s.
He had certainly benefited. His meals were
always ready for him, and in every way his wife
now showed a cheerful concern for his comfort,
under the benign influence of which he began to
contest with her in rotundity of figure. Indeed,
Tapkins himself felt a qualm of conscience when
he saw the improvement in Jackson, and remem-
bered that he had told this same husband to
chastise the wife who had wrought the happy
change.
# * *
A month and more had gone by, and Jackson
was to be found busy in his shop. The clock
pointed to six, and he was waiting to hear his
wife’s voice calling him into the little parlour to
tea; as was her daily and regular custom.
That morning, they had had a slight difference,
so slight indeed as not to be worth recounting to
the reader, who may not have had a personal
acquaintance with the Jacksons. Such differences
occur in every household where there are a hus-
band and wife, though to be sure—and it is a
matter for sincere congratulation—all the wives
do not exhibit the peculiar temper possessed by
Mrs. Jackson. Many wives, it is safe to assert,
would declare the state of matrimony to be in-
tolerable were it not for an occasional “breeze.”
As it was, Jackson had acted the meek man, and
allowed his wife the last word, rather than “raise
a row;” and to prevent the impending catas-
trophe, retreated to his never-failing refuge—
the shop. His wife had bestowed a very ugly
parting look from out those white corners of her
eyes, but lie had not observed it, and was there-
fore unprepared for any malice.
The clock jogged along, five, ten, fifteen
minutes ; then the unsuspecting husband’s patience
Le:ame exhausted, and he went ins .a to see what
had upset the household machinery. He felt a
little taken aback upon finding his young wife,
with her groat schoolgirl face, seated calmly at
the table, enjoying the repast spread out before
her, and which he was in the habit of sharing.
His children sat around ominously quiet. _ Doubt-
less they had been forbidden to acquaint their
hungry father of the meal awaiting him.
“I think you might have given me a call,
Sarah,” was all he reproachfully ventured to re-
mark.
She lifted her large, mild blue eyes to him, and
stared. “You should have come in,” she said,
with a nasty inflection of voice; “you knew the
time. ”
The husband had no reply for such a speech.
His wife was too much for him, he felt, so he
meekly took his seat, and the meal was begun and
ended in silence. Then Jackson rose from his
chair, and walked across the room to the cradle,
wherein his baby lay kicking up its heels. He bent
down and lifted it up in his arms.
“Leave that child alone —it’s mine ! ” the voice
of his wife sounded peremptorily in his ears.
Jackson nearly let the child fall in astonishment.
What nonsense for his wife to utter! The hus-
band’s spirit was not wholly gone.
“ Well,” he ejaculated, though quite staggered
by this new move on the part of his wife, “ isn’t it
mi ?” but even to Jackson’s somewhat dull wit
the argument was too absurd to pursue ; and he
showed a lingering sense of his position by stoop-
ing again to pick up his child (he had weakly put
it down at his wife’s sharp bidding). But his
purpose was frustrated by the mother, who darted
forward and snatched it herself from the cradle,
striking the father’s overhanging face with the
baby’s foot as she swept it up in her arms.
Jackson affected a weak laugh, pretending he
didn’t mind. “ Have it your own way, my good
woman,” he remarked sweetly.
Possessed of the baby, his wife walked haughtily
out of the room, leaving poor Jackson standing
gaping at her, and trying to take in the situation.
When the door had closed upon her he began to
whistle, and then slunk out of the room and into
the score. Master here, at any rate, he began to
rummage about among the shelves by the aid of
what little light was shed frcm the parlour. By
and by he got tired of poking about, with no par-
ticular object; and as it had become late he
thought he would go to bed. No doubt, ere going
to sleep, his wife would come round again and
they could make it up.
The little parlour was quiet and deserted when
he re-entered it.' This was rather to his liking,
for he would then go straight up to his room and
he could speak to his wife as if nothing had hap-
pened. It was not his place to make the advance,
he knew, but rows of any sort he could not
endure ; they upset him and made him miserable.
He put the lights out and trusted to find his
way in the dark. This was easy, and he safely
gained his bedroom door and opened it, or rather
he turned the handle for that purpose.
“ Good Heavens!” she had locked him out of
his —their room, in her temper. He tried it again;
it was locked. Then he called out “Sarah.”
No answer ! Then he shook the door, and
called again—and waited ; then shook it again,
and held his breath. Was she speaking? Yes!
“Go away and let me get to sleep !” The words
reached his ears, muffled, of course, for she had
scarcely taken the trouble to lift her head from
the pillow, but the cruel, spiteful hardness of the
tones could not be mistaken; so Jackson retreated
in hopeless dismay, without another attempt, to
gain his room. He found his way along the
passage, and into the room where his children lay
asleep. Dreaming, perchance, of a world where
all was joy, and happiness, and smiles, and
harmony. He threw himself upon the bed, beside
one of his sleeping children, with the feelings of
an outcast. It did not occur to him that it was
his duty to go and throw his whole weight upon
his bedroom door, and break it down, and so get
into the room and bring his wife back to her
senses. But, then, he could not have called up
spirit enough to have done such a thing, had the
idea occurred to him. He slept but little that
night, and it was small credit to him that he rose
so very early in the morning, as to be able to take
his shutters down before his rival in the trade —
Chalker across the road —who made it a boast
that he always caught the first worm stirring in
H
Jackson procured his own breakfast, as well as
that of his children, for the excellent reason that
his wife was apparently indisposed for that duty,
seeing that she did not appear upon the scene, and
with the recollection of her conduct of the night
before, still fresh and keen in his mind, the hus-
band was far from being in the mood to lead his
wife to a better state of mind, or possessed of the
will to insist upon her behaving as a woman, and
wife, instead of sulkily acting the part of a child.
As the day wore on, and customers visited the
shop, Jackson’s face began to lose its sombre
expression, and his spirits likewise began to
rise, under the stimulating and diverting discus-
sions that arose upon the question of the “high
price for grain ” and “ extraordinary weather for
the time of year.’’ He had forgotten for the
nonce, whilst chatting with Frogley, the trouble
with his wife.
“ Good morning, Mrs. Jackson,” Frogley called
out with jocular civility.
It was in the afternoon, and Jackson had not
observed his wife enter the shop from the little
parlour.
1 ‘ Good morning, Mr. Frogley, ” she responded,
with a pleasant face, not looking at her husband,
whose eyes were fixed upon her with a bewildered
look ; as she held her baby in one arm, while with
the other she carried a carpet-bag.
She had to pass close to both men on her way
out of the shop. She glanced across the counter
to her husband, and gave him a hard, meaning
look.
“I am going off now, to mother’s,” she said,
with a smile intended to deceive Frogley.
“What, homesick already!”—the latter chaf-
fingly exclaimed; and turning so as to address
both the husband and wife, added, with a broad
laugh, “ They are all alike—the women.”
Mrs. Jackson made no reply, but hastened on.
Frogley evidently did not notice anything, for he
turned and watched her to the door, and then
observed bluntly ; “ Your wife looks well, Jackson
—what have you been doing to her ? ”
As the latter only mumbled out something to
the effect that “he supposed the old woman was
all right,” Frogley in the absence of any en-
couragement to continue that topic, or any other,
gathered his packages together, and took his de-
parture from the store.
Left to himself, Jackson’s spirit collapsed ; then
as if an idea had suddenly come to him, he rushed
round the counter, and ran to the door.
In the distance he could just make out the
figure of his wife hurrying along, her bag hanging
at her side. She meant to leave him, then, it was
no childish trick, that going out of the shop ; and
the remark. He seemed at last to realise the con-
duct of his wife in the spirit of the average, and
therefore, of course, human husband, for he raised
his clenched fist, and shook it at her. “You—
you—you she —you she-devil ! ” he gasped out,
after which he returned to his place at the counter.
It was only a passing burst of indignation that
had seized upon him.
Anyone speaking to Jackson five minutes later,
would have conversed with a woe-begone, sad-
dened and spiritless object of humanity ; from
whom, each moment, he might easily have ex-
pected a copious flood of tears.
Jackson behaved like a fool in his shop for the
rest of the day. He made the most funny mis-
takes, in excuse for which, when pointed out to
him, he said, in a devil-may-care fashion, “Mis-
takes, you know, will occur in the best regulated
families.”
As soon' as he had put the shutters up in the
evening, he made straightway for Tapkins’ house.
Tapkins must have seen him approaching, for he
opened the door before Jackson could knock, a
look of intelligence and expectation beaming
eagerly upon his little countenance.
“ What is it, Jackson ?” he said, extending his
hand ; “ the wife again, eh ?”
Jackson bowed his head in a forlorn manner.
“What! —you don’t say so?” Tapkins jerked
out, with happy inconsistency,
Then Jackson’s tongue fulfilled its office, and
he fervidly narrated, under a deep sense of injury
and affliction, the story of his wife’s second flight
from her home. Tapkins listened with animated
interest. He thrust his hands deep down into his
trousers pockets, and kept them there, and pushed
his little stomach outwards ; and when Jackson’s
story was finished, he burst in with so much vehe-
mence as almost to make Jackson think he was
angry with him.
“Now, then, do you know what I would have
done with a wife like that?” he said. “I would
have thrashed her.”
Which, by the way, was the last thing in the
world Tapkins would have done, or dreamt of
doing. His wife would have wrung his small
neck had he even hinted at such an outrage.
However, as Jackson had no knowledge of Tap-
kins’ marital status, the moral effect of his
language was in no way impaired in consequence.
“But what am I to do?” enquired Jackson
bluntly and helplessly, coming direct to the point
of his own real trouble and little interested in a
problematic one of Tapkins’ suggestion.
“ Do about it?” the latter exclaimed in assumed
astonishment—“ do what I have said, of course.”
And standing back after the delivery of this
short but pointed speech, Tapkins contemplated
Jackson, as if conscious of having sounded the
note of deliverance of all wife-deserted husbands.
Certain it is he did not perplex the unfortunate
man by the utterance of any useless phrases of
cant that might have come trippingly from the
tongue under such tempting provocation.
After some reflection, with his eyes cast upon
the ground, whilst Tapkins eyed him with con-
siderable interest, Jackson looked up and said
simply ; “Do you think it would do her good ?”
“You would have the best wife in the world
after you had done it,” the other replied promptly
and confidently.
Holding out his hand and keeping his eyes still
fixed upon the ground, and without speaking but
looking deeply abstracted, Jackson walked away.
Nor did he lift his head till he bumped himself
against Tapkins’ gate.
When he gained his little parlour once more he
found three of his children fast asleep, whilst the
eldest was awake, keeping watch and endeavour-
ing to act up bravely to the position of responsi-
bility placed in her keeping by her father before
he had set out to Tapkins’ house. At sight of
this, which brought home to him his desolate
position, Jackson gave way completely and cried
like a child.
A long and wretched week passed for him.
Each day he acted the part of wife, mother and
father in his home, tending to his children in all
their personal needs ; dressing, washing, and pro-
viding their meals. At the end of the week, feel-
ing sure that las wife would never return, he
penned a laboured letter to her—which circum-
stance he withheld from Tapkins, otherwise abso-
lutely in his confidence—wherein he begged his
wife to return to him and his children ; and he

would forgive all.
The letter was a pitiable specimen of maudlin
affection, qualified by meet, and would-be stern
reproof. She did not so much as condescend to
acknowledge its receipt. Yet, as each day arrived,
Jackson started with hope and expectation, at
every shadow that darkened his shop door. Had
his wife at any one of these moments walked in,
and gone up to him with the baby in her arms,
and a smile upon her face, Jackson would have
tried to look stern and forbidding, and the next
moment taken the child and mother to his heart.
’Lapkins’ behaviour now became remarkable.
Every day he dropped casually into the store to
have a talk with Jackson, and every day he ended
up with the enquiry—“Any news?” To which
Jackson responded by a solemn shake of his head.
One afternoon —a good three weeks after Mrs.
Jackson had left her home —Tapkins was in the
shop paying his daily visit. He was at one side of
the counter, Jackson at the other, neither speak-
ing, both thinking very deeply to all appearances,
but they had ceased talking for want of something
to say. A step at the door and a shadow aroused
both, and both turned to see the cause. Both got
a surprise. It was Jackson’s wife come back. Her
baby was in her arms, and in all respects she
might have returned after no more than an hour’s
absence instead of an absence measured by weeks.
She nodded with a frank smile to both men, as if
indeed she had only parted within the past hour.
Jackson was speechless, and he looked at his
wife with a vacuous expression, his eyes following
her into the little parlour into which she passed
with an easy coolness and indifference to the situa-
tion that would have been sublime in its assump-
tion only that it was genuine.
Tapkins got frightfully red in the face and his
round eyes protruded terribly with excitement.
He leaned across and looked at J ackson hard.
“ Well,” he said.
Jackson looked like one who looks and sees
nothing, then his head moved round as if seeking
something that he did not want to find.
“Take this,” said Tapkins, in a voice that his
wife would not have recognised just then, and he
handed across the counter a light, handsome
malacca cane; which Jackson took as he might
have taken a knife to kill himself with.
Amd then Tapkins wished himself well out of the
business.
“Of course, do as you like, Jackson,” he ob-
served as a precaution, pointedly disclaiming all
responsibility in the transaction; “it is for you
to act —perhaps it is going rather far.”
“ I know —give me the stick,” Jackson said, not
heeding the latter part of the sentence. Tapkins
glanced down at Jackson’s hand, nervously grasp-
ing the stick he had called for ; Jackson’s watery
sunken eyes followed the glance and became in-
telligent ; and acting upon a sudden impulse, he
darted towards the little parlour, and then, as the
glass-door closed behind the grocer, Tapkins,
became seized by an equally sudden impulse, that
carried him in an opposite direction —he fled preci-
pitately from the store.
“ Heavens—oh Lord !” he exclaimed to himself,
with a little laugh, “I believe the fellow means
to do it.”
Outside the shop he almost ran into an
acquaintance approaching from the opposite
direction. “Hollo, Tapkins, you seem to be in a
hurry,” his friend observed, halting.
“ Oh, no! —l’m just getting home, that’s all—
nice day, isn’t it?” And getting a few yards
away, he called back, socially,
“ I think it looks like rain though.”
Gaining his home he sought out his wife, whom
he gazed upon with surreptitious glances, ap-
parently having discovered a new interest in her
person. “If he has,” he exclaimed audibly to
himself. 1
“ What are you referring to, Thomas,” his wife
enquired.
“Oh, I was only thinking about something,’’
Tapkins replied with a start.
“Not .much, I’ll be bound,” Mrs. Tapkins
retorted, in a tone of voice that plainly indicated
habitual indifference on her part to anything
that might interest Tapkins.
Next day the latter received a visit from Jack-
son. The two men met, as two who had mutually
shared and passed through some terrible danger—
and come out safely. Tapkins’ face wore a sneak-
ing expression, which he tried to smile away.
Jackson’s air of triumph and self-restraint was
most unusual with him. He began immediately :
“I have to thank you for your advice, Mr.
Tapkins.”
If Jackson had brought a love-message from his
wife, Tapkins could scarcely have shown more
astonishment.
“It was the right thing to do,” he continued,
with an approving and intelligent nod.
“What?” asked Tapkins, uneasily.
“The stick —you know,” Jackson answered.
“ But I didn’t use it upon her after all,” he added
quickly.
“ But you meant to ?” Tapkins nervously inter-
posed.
“ But I couldn’t do it again for the Crown of
England,” Jackson continued, fervently, appar-
ently following out a mental scene and ignoring
Tapkins’ enquiry.
Then he told the latter all about it. “ She was
putting the baby in the cradle,” he said, “ when I
went in, but she didn’t look round—and that’s
just what settled it, Mr. Tapkins. By God, that
did make me mad. I went straight up to her.
‘Now, missus,’ I said, ‘this is for you,’ and I
shook your cane at her.”
“You have brought it with you?” Tapkins
interjected anxiously,
“She was down on her knees in a moment—
‘ Oh, my God, Harry ! —you can’t mean that!’ she
said to me, and caught hold of my hand. ‘ Very
well, Sarah,’ I said, ‘I won’t.’”
“Quite right, Jackson,” Tapkins observed,
patronisingly.
“Just then the shop-bell rang, and between
you and me and the cat, there, I was glad to get
out of it. When I went into the room again she
was crying like a child. ‘ Well, Sarah, you have
only yourself to blame,’l said. ‘Yes, I know,’
she said. ‘lt is my temper, but I’ll never leave
you again.’”
“What I told you, you see,” Tapkins inter-
rupted, conceitedly.
“But, I hope no man will ask me to lay my
hands on a woman again,” Jackson next said,
after a pause, as if trying to solace his conscience
for a not altogether exalted act of wifely correc-
tion, and when he had gone, Tapkins walked
about the room, laughing with that deprecating
inward expression natural to the man, who, having
advised a mean action, discovers that it has re-
dounded to his virtue and credit. “ Well —well,”
he several times muttered to himself, “/couldn’t
have done it—no, not if I had been asked !”
Three years have passed by since Jackson
administered the moral castigation to his pastoral
wife, of the mild blue eyes and great school-girl
face, yet, in all that time, nothing has ever trans-
pired in their household calculated in the smallest
degree to ruffle their marital harmony, or to lessen
the moral of the stick as a deterrent to wives of a
restless disposition.

who will forward the Pamphlet by return mail.
We would respectfully refer as to our reliability to the Editor of this paper.
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and-private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7 :
“ *** Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying, I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. 1 sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ I would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of. disease.’ I
can say -for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than,when I bought your pamphlet.—Your brother in
Christ, Milks Grant.”
'Dr. J. W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes :
■“Dear Dr. Hall, —After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
so delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that 1 at once ordered six of my
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. lam happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You have doire a
great work for afflicted humanity.—Your fraternal friend,
J. W. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nicld, Livonia, Ind , writes ;
.“At the time I received your pamphlet on Health and
Longevity, I was suffering from internal piles. After
putting your treatment into practice three times I bade
my trouble good-bye, and have not felt it since. I have
only ,to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that I have more faith
in your system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all the doctors on earth combined.—Yours very truly,
Thos. NucLd.”
Rev. A. L. Cole, D.D., M.D., Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pam-
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment,- as follows
“ Dear Dr. Hall,—l have nothing to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms
of disease and removes it by aiding and abetting nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This I call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-five years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
all candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment. I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and I honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The $4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of my whole life. You are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. God bless you in
your beneficent work.”—A. L. Cole.
Rev. Geo. Cook, of Millican, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamphlets, and writes :
“ Dear Friend, Dr. Hall,— lnclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed. My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
all are pleased with it. I will report further soon, and
send for a number of pamphlets.—Yours truly, George
Cook."
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate coiistitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a ‘‘Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only' means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be ma’ntained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice, 1
providing.they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N.J., and who admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes :
“ Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. I read it with avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be
and more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have i derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. Pebbles, M.D.”
• [Dr. Peebles is a graduate of several medical colleges)
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefully”—a
work which we have read with profound interest. The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
Rev. M. Fernsler, Scliafferstown, Pa., writes :
“Dr. A. Wilforo Hall. Dear Sir, —Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years I have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost anew man ; and
I can never pay the debt of gratitude I owe you for the
blessing you have conferved upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you will
send me some blank Pledges of Honor I will let my
afflicted neighbours know about the great remedy that is
in store for them.—Yours very truly, M. Fernsler.”
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. . In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
* * * * * “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that tifne. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time—forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to. him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.—R. F. Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smith, pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Inch Ter., writes :
“Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. W. H.
Hicks, our Congregational minister, and the money fm
his pamphlet. * * * I am not a bit 1 surprised to see in
the June ‘Microcosm’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. I want to tell you wdth tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up as incurable. She had patiently and reso-
lutely tried all sorts of medicines recommended by
different friends, when your pamphlet arrived. She at
once read it with me, and we became fully convinced as
to the soundness of your reasoning. Withoutloss of time
she proceeded to adopt your remedy, and now what words
can I employ to express our happiness over the result?
* * * She commenced to improve in strepgth and flesh
immediately, and so marvellous has been the change that
she now weighs as much as ever she did! Praise God,
and thanks to you, Dr. Hall. The dark cloud has been
lifted from our sky. — Your grateful friend, M. A. Smith.
Alison C. Roe, Esq., Buchanan, Mich., writes:
“Dear Dr. Hall,— l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity. I am very
thankful that 1 was somewhat acquainted with your
writings, having read the 1 Problem of Human Life ’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the ‘ Microcosm.’
Had I not known of you through your previous dis-
coveries in science I fear I should have given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
which is destined to do so much for suffering humanity.
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours
Alison 0. Roe.”

Dear Bulx.etxn,—ln a recent Bulletin tale,
“An Angel Unawares,” an incident is recorded in which a
journalist extracted himself from the clutches of his land-
lord’s bailiff by compounding with that gentleman and
removing his furniture to another house. As fiction
worthy of the name should at least have the merit of
truth in regard to essential details, and to caution such
of your readers as might be inclined to adopt the expedient
of '‘Creeve Roe” I would be glad if you would publish
the fact that Creeve Roe has vitally erred on an important
legal point. The law stands thus: —Any land.ord can
follow the goods of his late tenant to wherever he may be
enabled to find them within the period of 30 days and
distrain thereon just as though they were upon his own
premisis. Thus if I shift my furniture into another house
owing rent at my late abode my present landlord is liable
to lose his rent should the first landlord track me up.
Further, should I have sold out to an auctioneer and he
in turn have disposed of my goods, the landlord can claim
the sold property and leave the auctioneer and purchaser
lamenting. The sole exception to this rule applies to
time-payment goods, which the landlord can levy upon
only on his own property. Once shift time-payment fur-
niture and it is safe. Experto credo. Yours, Charles
Junor. [This letter, which actually presumes to give an
old and talented, we need not add experienced, Bulletin
man advice on the bailiff-question, is so presumptuous as
to verge on blasphpmy. “ The landlord may follow your
goods, it is true, but he has to find them,” remarks Creeve
Hoe.— Ed. B.]
The Victorian “ Freetrade Democratic
Association ” has burst suddenly from hollowness
and internal gas, and there is nothing left but two
or three disconnected apostles and a pamphlet full
of disjointed horse-reasoning. The association
broke up because it wasn’t democratic, and none
of its members knew what Freetrade really was.
There were about seven of them in their best days,
and they used to sit huddled together in the
corner of a vast, empty, desolate hall, and make
surprising declarations to each other about the
progress of their great principle. The memb 1 rship
increased 14 per cent, the first month owing to
the fact that a red-headed person of weak intellect
joined the society under the influence of a misap-
prehension, but that was its firs 1- , and last success.
When the cold weather came the statistics froze,
and most of the dogmas burst, and the new
member, who had hung on from a convicticn that
there was a horse-race somewhere on the pro-
gramme, grew discouraged and turned the whole
thing up. And at last there was only one active
member left, and he grew tired of delivering
exhortations to himself in the empty hall, and
stopped coming.
Sir W. C. Windeyer still continues to
suppress the list of causes coming on in his—we
speak advisedly when we say his —Divorce Court.
Now, how many causes, criminal and civil, have
been decided on evidence volunteered by people
who had seen from the press that a certain cause
was coming on? How many gross injustices have
been done by the suppression of evidence ?
There has been some discussion of late over
the choice of paintings for Melbourne Art Gal-
lery. Why must the gallery perforce be Eng.

that pictures twice as good can be bought in Paris

No. VIII.—Bob Warphy’s Kindly Deed.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
-The low, black hull of the Meander,
prison-hulk, Woolwich, was, on a September even-
ing in 183-, bustling with life and ringing with
sound. She was an inert and silent mass an hour
ago; now she was vivid with motion and noise,
lor within the hour she had received into her
’tween decks and the barred recesses of her hold
120 ironed convicts. From the metropolis about
80 had come, and by a coincidence there had
arrived at the same moment a couple of consign-
ments of like sin and misery from the rural dis-
tricts. The summer Assizes and the Old Bailey
Sessions were working harmoniously together in
the good work of freeing Merrie England from the
rabbit-poachers, the turnip-stealers, the pocket-
handkerchief-“ and similar hardened
ruffians; and between them those justly-lauded
Institutions of British Law had succeeded in
cageing, at the rate of two a minute, six-score of
the said ruffians on the Meander hulk as a
preliminary to despatching them to Port Jackson.
One of the coasting contingent is a short,
sickly-lookmg fellow of 35 or 36 years of age.
I here is a week’s growth of brownish hairiness on
his pallid cheeks and chin; his linen, or the frag-
ment of it visible, is encrusted with dirt, and in
that respect resembles his hands, which are
manacled —one to a chain, and the other to a
brother-convict’s handcuff. Still, unkempt and
unshaved as he is, he looks what, in the cant of
the Hulk Reports is termed “Superior.” And
the man who could look “superior” after a
seven-days’ tramp on the chain from an assize-
town to the shipment port would easily pass for a
gentleman when attired in clean clothes of a
respectable cut and freed from disgraceful sur-
roundings. Seven days in a transport-gang
would have made the First Gentleman in Europe
look like a costermongering cad, and there is some
excuse, therefore, for the failure of Mrs. John
Griffiths to identify her gentlemanly-looking
husband with the sickly and disreputable convict
to whom reference has been made.
It is between-decks. Hustled up the gangway,
hustled down the hatchway, the chained and
manacled group, eighteen or nineteen strong,
to which the sickly creature is literally attached,
has flung itself down in a tired, reckless, and des-
pairing heap to wait its turn at the anvil-block
where the “ land’’-irons are to be unriveted and
ship-irons put on. And the woman Griffiths,
pretty and well-formed, with the wholesome
aspect of the countryside lingering about her,
though the strain of a great anguish is burdening
her as palpably as does the child she carries in her
arms, pass by not perceiving that her husband is
among the huddled wretches.
“I don’t—see—him !” she gasped, with a tone-
less hoarseness, to the constable who was guiding
her in the semi-darkness.
The constable had been aggravated by the sud-
den inrush of prisoners. The old black hulk had
been empty of an infamous cargo this month past,
and here all at once, just the day, too, that he had
arranged to enjoy a long-shore outing, she had
filled up. No wonder he was irascible and out of
temper. British Law expected him to be vigilant
and punctual for the sum of one pound three-and-
fourpence weekly stipend, but there was no con-
dition in the bond as to humaneness or kindliness
of temper. He snorted in reply: “Then, you
jade, ’ow the devil can I see ’im if you can’t?
An’ ’ow can I waste my time ’ere on ye a-lookin’
for ’im unless you pay me ?”
“I haven’t anything, sir—at least, sir, not
much .”
“You’ve got ’miff to buy your dicky-man
sum’at,'l know, an’ you’ll have to fin’ me sum’at,
too, or off you go ! I ain’t no time to waste
a-lookin’ for hussies’ men !”
Trembling, the girl changed the arm on which
the child, a bonnie boy of two years, slumbered,
and tremblingly drew from her pocket a netted
purse. She was extracting one of the paltry store
of seven-shilling pieces which it contained when
there was a sudden movement among some of the
London portion of the newly-arrived cargo, and,
in a moment, the purse had been snatched from
her hand. The thief flung himself back into his
gang—and a jeer of derision signalled that the act
had been perceived by others and was aoplauded,
r “My purse, my purse 1 ” shrieked the woman.
The cry was unavailing; the constable, addition-
ally angered by the loss of the anticipated bribe,
knew it was useless searching for the offender for
the stolen article, and pushed the woman insolently
towards the hatchway “ ’Ere, get ’way with you.
Sarves you right losin’ your mopuses, a-takin’ up
my time to no purpose, an’ me so much to do.”
The woman turned and prayed to the quarter
whence the thief had emerged. “Oh, sir, who
took my purse, please give it me. I’ve nothing
to get home with, or to get food for my child ! ”
The appeal was in vain. Still, it gained the
object with which she had visited the hulk. Her
voice reached the ears of her husband, over the
infernal noises of the place. He was lying on the
deck apathetic, craving for the death which
would not come, and endeavouring to drown in
sleep the consciousness and the remorse which
crushed him with a weight more terrible than that
of his irons.
“Mary!” he cried. “Mary! Is that you ? ”
He pulled himself up by the chain and a staple
in the bulkhead. “Oh, Mary, this is good of
you—and what is the matter dear ?” He dragged
his share of the chain and the body of his chain-
mate with him, towards where she was standing
in the half-light of the hatchway. And at his
words, the girl, forgetful of her money loss, and
mindful only that her husband was there, whom
she had never thought to see again, turned to that
dear soul and embraced him. What to her was
it that a hundred curious glances were resting
upon them —that she could not be clasped in his
arms because they were iron-gripped—that every
tender word that welled from her clinging lips
was overheard by a score of contemptuous ears ?
She turned and passed her disengaged arm
round his neck. “My John! I’ve found you at
last!” And she fondled him, pressing the little
one to his face, murmuring the while soft love-
words. But—
“ ’Ere—time’s up ! Come along now I” The
constable so interfered-.
“Oh, sir, leave me just a few minutes longer !”
“ None of that, now ! I can’t leave you—there’s
others ’sides you want to see their aneas [men],
an’ I ain’t no time, unless you pay me.”
The mention of payment recalled to her the loss
of her purse. She had nothing beside its contents,
and now they were gone! Sixty miles from home,
and not a penny to reach home with —God !
But the Lord-Commissioners who, at this junc-
ture had something or other to do with the hulks
(what, in the plenitude of their wisdom, was
never precisely defined), had made a provision for
exigencies of the kind, and if she couldn’t find the
wherewithal to remunerate the Lord - Commis-
sioners’ representative, the constable, to wit, for
his loss of time in guarding her —“ Can’t leave you
alone here, missus; you’re too purty!” said the
leering fellow—well, she would have to go forth-
with. And, with scarcely a word of her love
spoken, and not a syllable uttered of the trust and
faith and hope for the future which she had
designed to bestow upon her unhappy husband,
she was being torn away, half-fainting, from his
side, when the constable remembered her wed-
ding-ring,
“ You’ve a fawney, ain’t you !” enquired the
constable.
“ A what, sir ?”
“A fawney—a weddin’-ring? Ain’t you a
honest ’ooman ?”
Too sore for indignation, the woman thrust
forth her left hand. The thin band of gold rested
upon the proper finger.
“ Oh, I sees, you’re right, missus! Well, jest
you give me that, an’ I’ll let you stay a ’ole hour
with your ol’ man. ’Tis against rules, you know,
but I don’ mind jest onst, as you won’ see ’im for
a long time agen, unless you go out to Botany Bay
yourself.”
The constable’s chuckle was contagious. Several
of the neighbouring prisoners laughed—laughed
the more heartily as they saw the officer, the
trusted Representative of My Lord - Commis-
sioners, attempt to pull the wedding-ring from the
Woman’s finger.
She drew back her hand, affrighted. “Not
that!” she said —“here, my shawl!—anything
but that!”
“That, or you go on shore this minit! ’Ow
d’you think I’m agoin’ to waste my time on you
without sum’at? Come, no nonsense, or
else
John Griffiths (real name), convict, under 14
years’ sentence for embezzlement, tried under the
style of “ John Jasker.” was as morally weak as
he was physically. Still, there was one virtue in
which he was not deficient, and that was the love
of his wife. He forgot himself in the moment
which succeeded the hulk-warder’s words. Linked
to the chain on one side, and coupled to his twin-
rogue on the other, with irons on his legs, he had
but one weapon of offence—his head. He pro-
pelled it forward, and caught the constable sharply
under the chin, thereby achieving two things—
the downfall of the officer, and a very bad “ hulk
report ” for himself.
And the last look that John Jasker, otherwise
Griffiths, had of his young wife and child, before
he left for the New Britannia of a Southern
World, was as she was hauled rudely up the tem-
porary ladder to the upper-deck.
She tarried as the constable pulled her to the
foot of the hatch, and cast a look of tearful affec.
tion to where her husband had stood. It flashed
through the inner gloom to the bulkhead like a
lightning streak into the core of thunderous
mountain gorges. Her husband saw her action
and heard her words, though she could not see
him.
“11l never let it go, John, never!-—not if I’m
starving ! When I can’t wear it, John, I’ll not be
—be an honest woman ! ” As she spoke, she flung
out her left hand so that her wedding-ring was
visible.
#• • •
In a month’s time John Jasker was on
board the ocean transport-ship and sailing away
from Woolwich to Botany Bay. With him went
that hulk-report: “ A dangerous character.”
The hulk-report was as simple a device as was
ever invented for driving a man, and a woman,
too, completely and entirely to the devil. If in
one of the hulks controlled by My Lords the
Commissioners, “a system of extortion and petty
tyranny went on by which the hulk-constables
oppressed the convicts waiting transport,” My
Lords the Commissioners were happy to inform
the Majesty of Parliament “ that their Lordships
were in ignorance of the facts. ” Which was not
at all a surprising thing, if their Lordships would
only have understood so. It would, under the
circumstances, have been rather surprising if they
had known anything of the matter. Notwith-
standing, a system of extortion and petty
tyranny did exist, one consequence being that a
man or a woman who resented the latter and had
not the means to satisfy the former generally
earned a vile “report.” In the magnanimity of
the Law, no record of a transport’s crime and
conviction was “ sent out ” with him. That was
to give him a chance in the new world. But
what never failed to go with him, once he passed
outwards over the hulk gangway, was a “ report.”
And woe betide him if when a tenant of a hulk-
plank he had shown an independence of spirit or
a complete emptiness of purse.
“ Constable, ” asked the Hulks Superintendent
as he was compiling reports a day or two before
the Ocean dropped alongside k« take im her cargo.
“John Jasker, No. 7 mess?”
“A werry bad ’un, your Honor—werry violent
an’ insubordinet, sir. Saluted me onct, your
Honor ’ll remember—dark cell seven days.”
“ Yes, I remember. That’ll do. Next!” And
while the constable was recalling the “next’s”
conduct, the Hulks Superintendent penned three
words against John Jasker’s name: “A danger-
ous character.”
Such was the routine for which Mjr Lords were
responsible, but of which they were in refreshing
ignorance.
# # #
It clung to Jasker always, did that report.
It won him classification during the daily exer-
cise-hour with a crew of villains which included at
least two murderers and a resurrectionist. It
procured for him the privilege of specially-
weighted irons, and the scarcely more desirable
enjoyment of peculiar exhortations from the
religiously-disposed Surgeon-Superintendent. And
it docked his water-allowance by a quantity equal
to one pint per week.
It clung to him on arrival at Port Jackson. He
was sullen and desperate when the clerks from the
Principal Superintendent’s Office came down to
check-off the manifest and to ascertain the parti-
culars of the convicts, The Surgeon-Superin-
tendent could supply them with no further
details respecting each man than -were endorsed
in his Hulk-report except such additional
character as the transport had gained for good or
ill during the voyage. In Jasker’s case this latter
record was simply : “Bad.”
With a “ dangerous ” Hulk-report, and a “bad”
ship-report, and a lowering sullenness of the
features when the clerks addressed him, it was
only to be expected that these gentlemen were
prejudiced against him, and that on their report
he was not put down for assignment, but was
merely ordered into the gaol-gang.
• # •
He was still in the gaol-gang when, four
years later, his wife with her boy, now a sturdy
youngster of nearly seven, arrived in Old Sydney.
By infinite pains and by surpassing economies,
the woman, moved by that intensity of unselfish
devotion which inspires so many of her sex to
heroic exertions for what in the world's sight is a
trivial object, had earned and saved money enough
to procure her and her child’s passage to Aus-
tralia. She had expected to have found her
husband free. In the one letter which he had
sent home, he had told her he was in a fair way
to obtain his liberty as a ticket-of-leave, and was
not very uncomfortable. His statement was a lie,
but its motive was to ease her anxiety on his
account, and hence we may not condemn it. But
when she arrived and found that he was still in
the gaol-gang, condemned thereto by sentence after
sentence for insubordination and insolence, sundry
scowlings and shruggings of shoulders, were so
called, it was a shock to her. All the greater, of
course, that she had looked to receive a free
or partially free man’s welcome. Permitted to
speak to him once, he informed her that unless by
influence of a more or less honourable kind she
could obtain a pardon for him, he would have to
serve another five years_ for his “ticket.” That
had been the effect of his later sentences—and of
the hulk-report.
It was his hulk-report always. “What is the
pris’ner’s police-report? ” a magistrate would ask
as Jasker was presented before him. “ Bad, y’r
worship ! ” the prosecuting officer would reply.
And then would he begin the repetition of Jasker’s
offences from his endorsed parchment, with the
hulk-report always heading the list. A “ good ”
hulk-report counted for little with any magistrate;
a bad one for much whether or not it was con-
firmed by subsequent conduct. And Jasker’s
later conduct had been marked by repeated acts of
insolence and so forth. A “bad hulk” stamped
the whole after-prison career of nine out of ten
convicts who were unfortunate enough to earnest.
In Jasker’s case it had prevented his assignment
and postponed the issue of his ticket. The greed
and malice of an illiterate hulk-constable had
ruined the transport’s nature. It would have
been a tragic if it had not been so commonplace
an incident of the System.
With her husband powerless to aid her, with a
growing boy hungry for food, what was Mrs.
Jasker or Griffiths to do ? Free from the tie of the
lad, she could have earned a living for herself, but
the necessity of earing for the boy handicapped
her. Free seamstress’ work, with so many con-
vict women available, was naturally ill-paid, and
many a week, after the cost of her material and
the rent of her poor room were defrayed from her
earnings, the remainder barely sufficed to find
food for the boy, let alone for herself. At last
someone of her few employers suggested she
should apply for her husband’s assignment to her-
self, and promised to back up her application. It
was refused by the Board of Assignments ; “appli-
cant had apparently no means of supporting the
prisoner applied forand besides, “ the prisoner
applied for is of very bad character, his police
report being notoriously bad, and it is essential to
his reformation and the protection of the com-
munity that he should be kept under strict super-
v sion in the gaol-gang.” That settled it for a
time.
Then she got a hint from a junior in the Board’s
office that if she could find £lO to fee himself and
one Timothy Pounce, the matter of the assign-
ment could be arranged. They would make the
terms very easy—would only ask for half the sum
down and the balance in six months after her hus-
band’s assignment. Pounce, for his half of the
money, would forge an application from an (ficti-
tious) inland settler, and he, himself, would put
the necessary papers through the Principal
Superintendent’s Office and the Board’s Office.
Mary J asker, however, could not raise ten shil-
lings, let alone ten pounds, and the liberal offer
of the Board’s Junior Clerk was reluctantly
refused.
She was at her wits’-end when Mr. Robert
Warphy introduced himself to her. Mr. Warphy
—albeit he was a Treasury official—was not above
doing a kindly deed, and being by chance present
one day in the Principal Superintendent’s office
when she had called to importune that high
authority to grant her husband’s services to save
her and her boy from starving, he had been
interested by her manners and her still pretty
face. “ Who’s that woman ?” he had asked of a
Prim Sup. ’s clerk.
“She wants to get her husband assigned to
her.”
“ Are you going to grant him ?”
“No—there’s an objection—she can’t support
him .”
“S’posenot. What should a woman like her
want her man assigned for except to support
her ?”
“ Well, that’s not all. The pris’ner’s of bad
record. Very bad hulk report, and a dozen or so
insubordination convictions.”
. “ Oh, that’s it, is it! Well, she’s still a pretty
piece of goods, and it might be worth while helping
her. ”
“ You’re too good, Warphy, you are ! ” laughed
the other. “ You want another chire amie so
soon ? Why it’s only a couple of months since
you got the Lynn woman her huskararl’s freedoms
isn’t it?”
“ Yes, her and him. \ caught a Tartar in
each of them, but this little woman’s different,
I’ll wager. She’ll keep open bouse for me for
longer than a couple of months if I do anything
for her.”
From which observations may be inferred the
nature of Mr. Robert Warphy’s kindly intentions.
• * *
He called on Mrs. Jasker, otherwise Grif-
fiths, at her miserable lodgings in Kent-street.
“You are Mrs. Jasker, ma’am?” He bowed
courteously, for he was the very pink of affability
was Bob Warphy, of the Treasury.
She curtsied assent, as she, dropping her sewing
prepared a chair for her visitor.
“ And you wish, I’m told, to get your husband
assigned to you—he’s in the gaol-gang now. ”
Oh, sir, I do ! I can’t make a living for my-
self and my boy, sir, unless ” —she stopped, the
tremors of her starved frame revealing at once her
weakness and the excitement of the hope which
had already leapt up within her, for she felt that
this gentleman’s call meant that something w^qld
“ Unless he is freed ?”
“Yes, sir, that is it. Oh, sir, will you get his
pardon or a ticket for him. If you only knew how
we—that is, my little boy, sir, suffers from want
of food and clothes !”
‘‘ I can understand !” he said, sympathetically,
but never swerving one jot’s breadth from his
purpose. The Satyr is always relentless. “Well,
I think I can get him his pardon—or, at least, his
assignment to you.”
“Oh, sir—God bless you* sir ’’she broke into
a rush of tears. “ Oh, sir, how can I thank you?’*
“Oh, well, you know,!’ he said, “these little
services are always paid for by an equivalent!”
“ Pay—equivalent ! ” she repeated the words
aimlessly. How could she pay aught ? And the
tears came again, this time the acrid drops of
disappointment.
“ Oh, yes—you know it’s always done when a
Woman wants her husband’s freedom. Why, I’ve
had three women when it was only a case of
tickets, not of pardon—but seeing as it is for you,
dear —and that you’re young and pretty ’’ —he
stooped to kiss her—“ I’ll get him his pardon.”
Till this moment, his meaning was not clear to
her. Now, there could be no mistaking it. She
pushed him away with her utmost strength,
and threw at him a glance in Which there was
hatred of the suggestion and scorn of the man who
uttered it.
“I thought you were—a gentleman!” With
her thin hands beating down the tumult in her
breast, she forced herself to speak. “You take—
advantage—of my cruel necessity—of my starving
child !”
“ H’ay nothing of the sort! It’s purely a
matter of bus’ness—done every day here —quite
the regular thing ! You Want your husband and
I want —Well —you !”
“ Sir, my husband shall die in chains first, and
my boy and lin the gutter. Go, sir, go !”
‘ Oh, well, if you think better of my proposal,
you can always hear of me at the Treasury—
Warphy’s my name—Mr. Robert W-ar-phy !” He
turned to go, but paused on the threshold to say
one parting word.
“ And, look here—l’ll oppose any assignment
and any pardon—application for which doesn’t
pass through my hands !”
“ I shall go to the Governor, sir ”
“ Do, my good woman, and tell him what I’ve
said. Do you think he’ll believe, you—you,-a
transport’s wife ? _ Take care he doesn’t imprison
you for blackmailing and slandering an officer of
the Government. That’s my advice, and good
day; !”
That was his advice—the advice of a thoroughly
experienced man of the Old Sydney world. A.nd
she knew enough of Old Sydney to act upon it.
* # *
With breaking heart she struggled on fox
a few weeks longer, when her boy cried for food.
Then, one day, taking her boy for a walk in the
Racecourse, from whence they passed by the, as
yet, roofless walls of St. Mary’s Chapel to the
Domain, she saw her husband ih the chain-gang
working by the Wooloomooloo embankment.
She drew as near as she could to him for fear of
the guards—to speak to the men of the iron-gangs
was a misdemeanour punishable by imprisonment
- and, scourging herself into unnatural calmness,
asked how he did.
In a brief whisper, that seemed, so acute was
its pain, to have sucked its bitterness from his
entrails, he begged her to get him “out of that.”
“ I shall die else —get me free—anyhow.”
Stunned, she had but one thought. That her
husband had learnt of the ways in which Freedom
could be bought and sold, and that he wished her
to tread that path of humiliation and sorrow.
“ How could he ! ” she thought. “If I had been
he, I’d have died first!” But Jasker.did not
know; his appeal had been simply wrung from
him by the utter misery of his condition.
From the Domain she went to the Treasury and
asked for Mr. Robert Warphy. She was shown
into his room.
“If you will gain my husband's pardon, sir—
when you will ! ” She looked into his face urn
blushingly. It was not for her to blush, she
thought. If the transaction was nefarious, it was
still a business one according to Old Sydney
notions, and she at least considered she was not
free of its infamy.
• • #
There was this much to be said for
Warphy. He was a man of his word. Other,
men of the System had entered into similar bar-
gains, and they had not invariably carried out
their part of the contract. Very religiously
Warphy, however, did. Within a few days, John
Jasker, per Ocean, received a conditional pardon,
Warphy did not do things by halves.
On the night of his release, Jasker sat in his
wife’s little room, and moaned out to her his
thankfulness that she had succeeded in winning
his pardon.
“But you have not told me, Mary, how you
managed it! You had no money, I know ! ”
For answer, she lifted her left hand to the lino
of his vision. He looked up wonderingly, for he
did not guess her meaning. She had to make it
plainer.
“Do you not remember, John, my last words
on board the hulk ? ”
“That I do, wife ! They’ve saved me many a
time from despair, and all that despair means ip
the gangs. ”
“ I said that I’d never take my ring off so long
as I was an honest woman ! ”
“ You did ! ” And he looked at the hand again
—and saw the ring was not on it!
She passed to the mantel, and taking a tiny
packet wrapped in paper from it, unfolded the
sheet, and held out to him her wedding-ring.
Then he understood; and insisted upon the
whole story being told him.
* * *
On the next day, he earned ten shillings,
and on the next day but one, he went into
Simpson’s hardware stores, opposite the old gaol
in Lower George-street and bought a horsewhip.
TBbe ’Brearswy was in Geerge-street als®. Thither
from the store he passed, bat Mr. Warphy was
out—had gone to the Club in Bent-street. Thither
then he went.
And on the steps of the Club-house he saw a
number of gentlemen standing.
* * *
He went up and saluted them. One and
all stared at his effrontery, for “ Lag”’ was written
if not on his face, at least in the dragging of his
left leg. They were amazed to the degree of
wrathfulness, as, not content with saluting, he
addressed them :
“May I ask if either of you gentlemen is Mr.
Robert Warphy?”
“Ha, ha, Mr. Warphy,” condescended to jocu-
larly remark his Excellency General Ralph Dar-
ling. “This the usual stamp of your Club-
callers ?”
“He, he—not quite, your Excellency,” re-
sponded Warphy, annoyed. “If you want to
see me, my man, you had better sail at the
Treasury !”
“This is a better plaae than the Treasury, yopj
Honor. You did me a kindness, Mr. Warphy, dr
wife one—and a kindness done to my
wife is one to me.”

Dr. PATERSON has been engaged for over
Twenty Yeaks in the study and practice of
CLD
HRONIC,
NERVOUS,
AND
Special Diseases
Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and
Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Look Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and nead,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. 6d. he will forward his book on the “Male
Generative Function in Health and Disease,”
or of Is., his book on “Nervous Debility."

“ Tush, my man, I don’t know you, and if I did
f our wife a kindness, it is—he-he ! —I trust what
’m ready to do to anyone. ”
“ But, sir, this kindness is an exceptional one—
and should receive exceptional thanks. And, sir,
this is how I thank and repay you !”
Uttering the last words, Jasker stepped for-
ward and, with the whip, struck Warphy sharply
across the face, and as sharply repeated the blow
before the bystanders could arrest his arm.
“ That’s how I repay the kindness of the man
who obtained my free'dom in exchange for the
debauching of my wife !”

At Charlotte Place Police Court within an
hour he was arraigned, and his police record —in-

evidence of his desperate character, he was ordered
.300 lashes. At the seventeenth stroke the weakli-
ness of his nature mastered his'resolution. He
died.
PRICE WARUNG.
A RAY OF SATISFACTION.
I love my Lottie dearly,
Though ’tis now a year, or nearly,
Since first I ’gan a»wooing on a chilly Autumn
night;
That she likewise loves sincerely
Is apparent rather clearly—
But she has another fellow whom I wouldn’t care
to fight.
I hate this low intruder :
He declares as how he “ knew’d her ”
Before I came across the little beauty on the
Block,
And nothing could be ruder
Than the way he has pursued her
Since he parted us one night with an ungentle-
manly knock.
In a manner gay and dashing
Luscious Lottie I was mashing,
And administering kisses to her lips so ripe and
red,
When my nose he started smashing,
And a lot of lights came flashing
In my eyes, quite unexpected, till I fancied I was
dead.
I yelled, but on the spot he,
With a sudden grip garrotty,
Very solemnly suggested that I’d better soon
retreat ;
I was silent, sick, and “ dotty ’
As he skipped away with Lottie—
And left me with a sense of having suffered a
defeat.
I am constantly complaining _
Of the way that chap’s behaving,
But it never seems to matter, for he doesn’t care a
cent;
I always have to cave in
To that prototype of Slavin,
And he’s “taking out” my darling with her
family’s consent.
I throw her tender glances
When he gives me any chances,
Yet it’s only now and then I’ve opportunities to
to look ;
And while I’m weaving fancies
On the scene my rival prances,
And with a cry of agony I softly take my hook.
My love is true and tender
For the sweetest of her gender,
Although my cup of sorrow runneth over at the
rim;
If Lottie, lithe and slender.
Weds this muscular pretender
There’ll be comfort in reflecting that I’ve got the
laugh of him. •
The Magazine of Art for April prints an
attack on the infamous Sydney “Post-office
carvings.”
A Melbourne housemaid lately went to
her master and declared there was a burglar in
the house. “Pooh, pooh !” said the boss; “it’s
only your follower,” and the girl was so indignant
that she gave notice on the spot. Meanwhile the
burglar stripped the hall of all the coats and
umbrellas.
Premier Parkes says the Queen has con-
ferred upon him “the highest honours in her
gift short of the Garter.” Now peerages, P.O.’s,
“The Bath,” “Thistle,” “St. Patrick,” and
“ Star of India,” are all above the tawdry Order
of Michael and George, which was only instituted
** to oblige crawling colonials.”

Melbourne Corporation fixes on electric-
lighting. Prime cost, £75,000 ; annual cost,
£20,000, —just about the same as gas, but to put
the wires underground would involve £400,000.
Only two of the original Victorian police-
force are in harness —Inspector Pewtress and
Sergeant Manson. Both date back from 1852.
Manson has been Sergeant for over 25 years. He
is a steady, well-educated man, and has had the
satisfaction of seeing dozens climb over his head.
Boehm’s Jubilee caricature of the Queen’s
head is to be replaced by something more lifelike
on the gold and silver coinage. Perhaps they will
give the job to a radical British sculptor, capable
of producing the image of a singularly disagree-
able, not to say sour-looking, old lady, without
any neck worth mentioning.

HUDSON’S EXTRACT OF SOAP reduces the Hours of Labour.
Tom Glassey, M.L.A. for Bundamba (Q.),
advocates the election of Judges by the people.
Tom is the typical working-man’s member in
Queensland, but he has managed to do very well
out of politics. Two of his sons have been
“ placed ” in the Civil Service since he blossomed
into a Parliamentarian.
It is cheering to note that the Australian
census is a failure as regards religion. The whole
column is a trick, as in England, by certain
dominant sects to sweep into their net a host of
people who really belong to no church. The census-
takers appear to have been sent out without any
definite instructions, and have failed to probe
people properly on religious details.
The Adelaide branch of the A. N. A.—like
a good many other branches —is slowly dying, and
the local authorities, who see that something must
be done, think of merging it into an Australian
Patriotic League to advocate Australian Federa-
tioh : all Australians, native-born or not, to be
admitted. The “Australian native,’ i.e., the
A.N. A., seems to be exotic outside of Victoria.
The U. S. going to interfere in Chili.
Right. Pan-America. You will see, if you live
as long as Parkes, a glorious Confederation of
America, beginning with a close-up of all the
South, under Brazil and Chili, after which the
North will whelm, with its U.S., Canada and
Mexico, for naught can resist the all-conquering
Union, which alone should have 500 million popu-
lation in 1991.
Whoever had the management of Sir
George Grey’s meeting in Melbourne sadly bun-
gled it. The sum of one shilling was spent in
advertising it, and that went to the Age. Yet
the old hero had a good attendance and a splendid
reception. Mr. J. T. Sitch should never mix his
votes of thanks with announcements of concerts
and prize-fights, no matter for what good purpose
they may be intended.
Sir George Grey’s Sydney Town Hall
speech got exactly a column and a quarter in the
S.M. Herald, and the description of the pro-
ceedings another quarter-col. ; total, col -and-half,
not so much space as Granny usually devotes to a
church bun-chewing contest. In the same issue
Dan. O’Connor got nearly half a column for the
adjectival bosh he slung at Sara Bernhardt, and
Single-tax Foxall was allowed two columns of self-
advertising space.
Parkes : “ My great office, high as it is in
honour, and the privileges it gives now and then
to do a gracious and kind thing, is not a particu-
larly attractive office for me, and it never has
been.” Toot—
Hi fancy Hi’ve ’eard that hafore, hold man,

But halways come back—

How to Grow Rich.—Invest in land at
Perth, W.A. Plans from Intercolonial Invest-
ment Co., Limited, 96 Bathurst-street, Sydney.
The inflated Colonel Tom Price, in re-
sponding to the toast of the health of the Victorian
Rifle team in London, declared that “ no popula-
tion in the world revered Queen Victoria more
than the Australians did, and that Australia
would always willingly assist the mother-country
in upholding the integrity of the Empire and the
honour of the sovereign.” We don’t need to con-
tradict this much - we only need to print it.
Never another State shilling or private soldier
from Australia for any Imperial war. Civil war
first.
As Parkes is “going to live to 120,” let
us put this on record : —
Gentlemen opposite said that in the Commonwealth
Protection would be certain. If that were so he (Si 1 '
Henry Parkes) would be banished from public life to the
end of his days, because he could never take part in a
Protectionist Government. He did not pretend to foresee
events, but he knew this from the best of the light with
which he was endowed by his Maker, that no law or policy
which hindered the freedom of individual life could be
sound or in accordance with the Divine teaching of Jesus
Christ. (Cheers.)
Parkes here not only swears never-failing antago-
nism to Protection, but insinuates that he will
not sit in Parliament, except as a holder of place
and pay.
The Bulletin predicts that the Queens-
land “ conspirators ” will not serve their three
years’sentences. Judge Harding, in his zeal for
“law and order,” has sadly overdone it. Had he
given each man six weeks’ gaol without hard
labour, and threatened bigger penalties next time,
he would have taken the diplomatic course and
the one most conducive to the welfare of Vested
Interests. The three years’ sentences simply
mean a battle-cry for associated labour. Judge
Harding has been rubbing nitric acid into the
cancer—equally by his absurd sentences and the
method in which he conducted the trial. He has
proved himself unfit to be a judge and should at
once be removed from the bench.
The kernel of the recommendations of the
N.S.W. Labour Commission is the establishment
by statute law of a Board of Conciliation and
Arbitration. In the conciliation branch of ad-
ministration, the recognition of the tribunal by
the parties to the dispute is to be purely optional;
in the arbitration branch it is to be gwcm-cornpul-
sory. Conciliation is to precede arbitration where-
ever possible. The Board is to consist of permanent
and removeable members. The permanent mem-
bers are to be the Arbitration Board proper ; the
whole.of the members —viz., the permanent ones
and others chosen by the parties disputing—are to
be the Conciliation Board. The permanent mem-
bers are to be not less than three in number —the
chairman to be appointed by the Government and
to be a neutral man ; the remainder to be chosen
equally by employed and employers, or committees
chosen by those parties to select their respective
judges.

EVERY HOUSEHOLD-especially where
there are young cnildren—should be provided
with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use of
which has saved innumerable lives. Its effect
is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough-Cure
in the world, it has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup, and tho sudden
"pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
in the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an un-
foreseen and sudden emergency.

The Shoe.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Battered and worn on the wayside lay
A shoe, unseen by the busy throng
Of passers who, through the dusty way,
From morn to eve had hurried along.
The sight bt that shoe to me had brought
A host of fancies, merry and snd,
Of a heart that struggled and toiled and wrought,
With never an hour of its life made glad.
Of a joyous and happy and winsome maid,
With mind all free from thought of guile ;
Of a soul with sin's black sorrows lade,
Of a face that ne’er was lit with smile.
Had the shoe been worn by any of these?
Was the wearer of it young and fair?
The answer is one, I hope, will please—
It was torn from the hoof of old Brown’s mare.

Old Yon Moltke, who recently died, will,
wo fear, continue to be a standing nuisance in the
matter of obituary drivel, and it will probably be
twenty years before the world realises that he was
not a great man after all, but merely a man who
came within an ace of greatness and missed it.
As a general, Moltke only once met an opponent
of first-rate ability, on equal terms, and on that
occasion he was licked. He made a considerable
name in ’64, when he turned dog on the country
which educated him —Denmark —but the odds
against the gallant Danes were twenty to one,
and anything short of an idiot or a corpse could
have led the German armies to victory under such
conditions almost as well as did Von Wrangel and
Moltke. He rose to fame when he defeated the
Austrians in ’66, and staked the needle-gun
against the ancient muzzle-loader—a weapon
which was as useless in such conditions as the
bow-and-arrow or the crossbow. Also fortune
was with him in other respects, for he had two
armies against one, and the Red Prince and the
recently - deceased Frederick — both reasonably
good generals—against Benedek, who was as
obsolete at his own guns. The poor, fossilised,
blue-moulded Austrian had the courage of a
whole shipload of lions, but otherwise he was
merely another sample of the great "Shook of Gam-
pridge” fraternity, and there was a strange pathos
about the grand old muddled hero, when he had
lost all save his indomitable pluck, charging like
a common soldier into the thickest of the carnage
in the hope that a Prussian bullet would send him
to join his slaughtered troopers. third
great show was against the French in 1870, and
there also his luck stood by him, for the French
only mustered some 250,000 men to oppose
over twice that number, and they gave the
command to the apoplectic Bazaine. Moltke
gained a lot of credit by doubling up that ancient
sham, but Bazaine had been doubled-up long
before that time, in Mexico, by a certain Indian
lawyer named Juarez, and there were lots of
generals scattered over Europe who could have
wiped out the old, fat Marshal, with his harem,
and his caravan of liquor, and his other appur-
tenances. A few months later Moltke nearly met
a man of his own size in the shape of Chanzy,
but missed him. That brilliant Frenchman, with
his army of ploughboys, clerks and farmers, broke
up Moltke’s plans so effectually that it had
actually been resolved that the siege of Paris must
be abandoned; but just at the fatal moment
Bazaine surrendered Metz, and 200,000 Germans
who had been besieging that city rolled down like a
torrent on the new hero and headed him off by
sheer weight of numbers. Once in his early life,
however, the deceased marshal met a man of genius
on equal terms, and the man of genius smashed
him up. Moltke formed the new Turkish army in
the reign of Sultan Mahmoud, and went into
Syria as virtual commander of that splendid force
to wallop the despised Egyptian and reconquer
Egypt. But though one Turk was better than
two Egyptians, Mehemet AIL and his adopted son
Ilbrahim made up the difference. Moltke con-
fined himself after that to fighting fifth-rate men,
and built his reputation by reviving the military
organization of Frederick the Great, with modi-
fications, and passing it off as his own. And as
Frederick got most of his organization from
Leopold of Dessau, and passed it off as his own, it
was a square deal all round.

Earl Granville died much impoverished; he
had had to give up his London mansion, confining
himself to Walmer Castle, where he succeeded
the Iron Duke of Wellington as Warden of the
Cinque Ports. His losses were caused through
the strikes, and Tory cronies asked hitn how he
liked his Tom Mann and Ben Tillett. But he
smole everlastingly.
From Berlin conies the story that the
little Crown Prince of Germany, aged 10, saw a
soldier on guard without his rifle, and ran off to
tell the sergeant. Whereupon the poor private
was punished, whilst Emperor William placed his
hand upon the head of his royal heir, and told
him he would make a splendid officer when he grew
up. In the meantime he must be a perfect little
beast of a boy.
At a Queensland station, the blacklegs
struck work because the manager put on two
freshly-recruited blacklegs who had been unionists.
This, of course, is that holy thing “freedom of
contract,” of which both squatters and their
servile tools boast. The manager promptly
recognised it as such by “sacking” the two
individuals in question, thus yielding to a score
of blacklegs what the pastoralists refused “on
principle ” to the Shearers’ Unions.
The Georgetown (Q.)P.M. lately told one
Mow Hen, boss-man at the Georgetown Joss
house, that he suspected the sacred edifice was an
opium-den and a snare for black boys _ and gins
worthy only of the Cities of the Plains. The
Queensland police might do worse than look up
the records of the reports in last American mail’s
papers about the shameful discoveries in the Joss-
dens of ’Frisco, and the smash-up crusade in-
itiated by the police, these Josses and demijosses
and altars all being alike iconoclasted as often as
they are erected.

“Soapy Sam,” Bishop of Oxford, was
travelling in a luxurious railway carnage, with
his holy legs on the opposite cushion, when a
gentleman looked in, asking, Is that seat
occupied?” “Yes,” said Soapy. . At the
station the gentleman looked in again with A o\ ,
reverend stranger, you’ve been fibbing, that seat
ain’t taken.” “ Never said it was, replied Soapy.
The lunatic King Otto, of Bavaria, ap-

bed-ridden —incapable of crawling round Ins state

keeper’s leg. The unfortunate monarch now
never tries to play marbles with his Prime Mims

very sad to such as remember how he used to
enjoy trying to pull out his private chaplain s wis-
dom-teeth with a silver-handled cork-screw.
George Bourne, an old Queensland ex-
plorer, for the last 10 years a Queensland Ciyd
Service clerk, has died of heart-disease in Bns-
bane. Bourne accompanied the late Billy Lands-
borough in his expedition across the continent in
’61, in search of traces of the Burke and Wills
exploration, when all Landsborough’s party lost
the numbers of their mess save the leader, and
Bourne and three blackboys. In 1887, the Royal
Geographical Society conferred the ‘ Murc.uson
grant ” for that year-a gold chronometer and a
certificate - on Bourne, who was then a hard-up
police-clerk, venturing towards embonpoint and
sporting faded dandyism of the Dundreary type.
George was a Gippsland native, youngest son of
Robert Bourne, who afterwards migrated to Bris-
bane. He was educated at a Sydney college till
he was 16, and then went jackerooing. He tried
his luck on the Victorian diggings in ’52, and
afterwards got ruined as a squatter on the Lach-
lan, N.S.W., by a drought. Then he took to
exploring.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctivc Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
nr.d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New’ Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of-the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
, The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
' tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

To 11. F. Kugel.mann, Esq.
Dear Sir —This is to certify that, I, Patrick Keenan, was
t aken ill about three years ago with a severe cold which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I ben-an
to .spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
©nd of three months I was taken bad one morning and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
Phlegm. From that time I commenced to improv e and
was gaming in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s

County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.’
