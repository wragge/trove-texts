National Notebook
Will
ITarold de Vahl Rubin, who died
in Brisbane recently, made a most
involved will. His solicitor, Mr F. G.
Forde, has estimated that it may be five
years before probate is granted. Few
people knew much about his financial
activities and those who do are not
talking.
He is reported to have given £500,000
to charities, art galleries and other
causes, including a £75,000 sheep
station to St Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney.
His estate may be well below the £1
million mark.
Essences
At the offices of Horwitz Publications,
Sydney, the finishing touches are
being put to the biggest project in the
company’s 40-year history: an encyclo-
paedia in one volume of Australia, New
Zealand, and Papua and New Guinea.
The work, entitled “The Modern Ency-
clopaedia of Australia and New Zea-
land”, contains 11,000 succinct entries,
will run to over 1200
pages of “Who’s Who”
size, and is due to go on
sale next month at a price
of £AB/15/-. Unlike other
encyclopaedias that are
available only on a sub-
scription basis from hard-
selling door-knockers, this one will be
a straightforward bookshop item.
It was snowing proofs when we visited
the wideawake offices of the encyclo-
paedia one evening recently; a late fall
of V's and W’s for the attention of a staff
that has been working back for many
months. Mr Stanley Horwitz, who is the
company's managing director, and Mr
Victor Barnes, the editor of the encyclo-
paedia, told us that the job has been
done in less than three years by a staff
of 13, not counting contributors and
special consultants. Everything in it has
been researched and written indepen-
dently of other encyclopaedias, including
the Grolier Society's 10-volume “Aus-
tralian Encyclopaedia” (first published
by Angus and Robertson), which has
been used only for cross-checking at the
proof stage.
The Horwitz encyclopaedia is written
in a highly condensed style that aims to
get down to what Mr Barnes called “the
essence of essential information”. There
are essay-type articles for subjects like
aborigines, art and literature, but most
entries are thumbnail descriptions with
references for further reading. “We don’t
guarantee a transitive verb in every sen-
tence,” Mr Barnes told us with a smile.
The encyclopaedia seems to have cast a
wide net. We took two quick looks at the
proofs and observed that Harry Messel
(science book and all) precedes a refer-
ence to Dally Messenger, and that Lyn-
don Dadswell duly takes his turn after
Dad and Dave.
No More Rise
HThe Shannon Rise, the phenomenon of
the annual hatching of innumerable
snow caddis in a few hundred yards of
river in Tasmania’s Central Highlands,
is doomed. Since the Miena dam was
built across the end of the Great Lake
50 years ago, the caddis have multiplied,
and the Rise draws countless voracious
trout, and hundreds of excited anglers.
The opening of Poatina power station,
drawing water through tunnels to the
north, will dry up the little Shannon
and the Rise. Anglers protested, but
Premier Eric Reece told them that the
water required to maintain the caddis is
worth a third of a million a year through
the Poatina turbines.
This information set the angling
writer of the Launceston
“Examiner” to calcula-
tions. “During the years
I’ve fished this wonder-
ful river I must have seen
about £l3 million worth
pass under the bridge,” he
\vrote. “I have even seen
people use it to boil the billy. If I had
£l3 million, I would gladly buy another
34 years of it.”
Sync, or Swim
“Oarracuda back pike somersault with
a full twist” sounds like a hard,
high dive. In fact it is one of about a
hundred stunts performed in and under
the water itself by girls who have taken
up a new sport called synchronised swim-
ming. Spectators at the Australian swim-
ming championships at North Sydney
were given demonstrations. After the
stopwatch tension of racing it was
strange to see these other swimmers
paddling about at the deep end as gently
as goldfish, submerging and surfacing to
the recorded sound of Hawaiian guitars.
Synchronised swimming is not water
ballet. Its stunts and routines all have
ratings of difficulty and are the basis of
competition by individuals and teams.
Even so, good performers have the air of
dancers, with great muscular and breath
control plus apparent unsinkability. They
seem to float upside down and half out
of the water as easily as marker buoys.
Mrs Maisie Freeman, who compered
the North Sydney displays, said after-

Joy Joy Joy
Tn Melbourne the police have let it be
known that the art of le strip has
had its day. The news has caused some
gloom at Sydney's Kings Cross, where it
is feared the Victorian notion might
spread. The Cross is suffering a rash of
small night spots featuring Girls! Girls!
Girls! and called by such fetching names
as The Pink Pussy Cat and Striperama.
Contrarily, the restaurant known as Les
Girls offers an all male revue, with
“Josie” and “Lilac Haze” and others.
This information is calculated to elicit
the query, has the old arty, bohemian
Cross with its sometimes odd but always
avid seekers after Truth vanished in the
new neon jungle? To which we can
answer that much of it has. The beards,
sandals and bulky sweaters seem fewer
now, or perhaps they have just become
less noticeable among the sweatshirt and
jeans set who swirl in and out of a
movie house converted to a palais de
stomp called Surf City.
The Cross’s celebrated foreign popu-
lation seems lost in the wash, too. Apart
from The Girls, there are more show
business people, and more of the chic
ones who walk their French poodles. As
you can sense, Kings Cross is changing
and sometimes there seems none of the
old Cross left. And just when you’ve
decided that is so, along comes some-
thing to prove it isn’t.
At least, that is the experience of
one of our friends who awoke late on
a Sunday, after a jarring night of surf
sounds, transistor radios, horn-blowing
cars, screaming jean-agers, and crowds,
crowds, crowds. He went out on to quiet
streets to buy his Sunday paper, and on
one corner found that some enterprising
person had dumped orange cases filled
with second-hand books on the pave-
ment, and was offering them for sale, with
scores of buyers. As he passed, a lady with
a poodle’s leash in one hand was using
the other to wrest an old copy of “Ginger
Mick” from a stout, bearded man in
shorts. Our friend walked on refreshed.
And only a little further on he found
another enterprising man with an upright
stand filled with glossy paperbacks, and
a sign, Buy a Book in Your Own Langu-
age. Our friend counted 25 distinct
languages in the collection, and there
seemed to be buyers for books in every
one of them. Our friend gave his beret
a twist, set his pipe at a higher angle,
and sauntered on, a happier man. He
was even constrained to reach out and
pat the head of the smallest of the five
Chinese children who were singing “Joy,
Joy, Joy” to the piano accordion ac-
companiment of the Chinese minister
who preaches from the Kings Cross
Woolworths entrance on Sunday after-
noons. Somehow, it suited his mood.
The Ad. Men
George Patterson’s whose activities
as our landlords always engage our
closest interest has long been re-
cognised as Australia’s leading advertis-
ing agency, notching up a £7,000,000
turnover last year. The company has now
joined four other leading Australian
agencies in being foreign-controlled.
Patterson’s sold a controlling share for
an undisclosed but doubtless handsome
sum to Ted Bates & Co. New York’s
biggest agency and third largest in the
US. This leaves only Jackson Wain,
among the top agencies, which is still
locally controlled.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Premier, the Commissioner
and “The Bulletin”
T'HE BULLETIN was astonished
A to read in the Press during the
week that the NSW Premier,
Mr R. J. Heffron, drawing on the
report of an investigation by Police
Commissioner Norman Allan, has
denied that the city of Broken Hill
does not break the State’s drinking,
gambling and betting laws. What
was even more astonishing was the
Premier’s statement that the Police
Commissioner on investigating an
article in THE BULLETIN of June
last year by Mr Bob Bottom, which
described Broken Hill’s unique
mores, had established that Mr Bot-
tom wrote his. article before taking
up his position in Broken Hill, had
no personal knowledge of the prac-
tices described, and had simply re-
hashed similar (presumably inac-
curate) articles by other writers,
tossing in a few extra details pro-
vided by “an informant”.
Now THE BULLETIN bears no
grudge against Broken Hill, at least
on the matters under dispute. When
one considers that it has the lowest
crime rate and the smallest police
force of any town of comparable
size in NSW, then its “lawlessness”
over drinking, gambling and betting
only go to suggest that perhaps
the law applied in the rest of NSW
is an ass and should be remodelled
on Broken Hill lines.
It is a different matter, however,
when the Premier of NSW and his
Police Commissioner announce to
the world that THE BULLETIN
has published an article by an un-
reliable, unprofessional and per-
haps, by innuendo, a dishonest
reporter. The facts are, as Mr Bot-
tom points out, on page 10 of this
issue, that he was born and
bred in Broken Hill, that he wrote
the article while in Broken Hill, and
that he had made personal ob-
servations of everything that he
wrote about. Further the former
Police Commissioner, Mr Colin
Delaney, had himself confirmed
Mr Bottom’s report.
The unprofessional, the unreliable
figures in this story are Premier
Heffron and Commissioner Allan.
THE BULLETIN does not parti-
cularly care what these gentlemen
say on most matters, but before
they attack THE BULLETIN they
could well take lessons in accurate
reporting perhaps from some of
THE BULLETIN’S reporters.
Confining Indonesia
T AST week the Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, Sir Garfield Bar-
wick, gave Parliament and nation a
sober and restrained report on
foreign affairs. Among other topics
he devoted some time to examining
the implications of France’s recog-
nition of Red China, to the perils
of General de Gaulle’s seductive
doctrine of neutralisation of South-
east Asia and to Indonesia’s con-
frontation of Malaysia. It is parti-
cularly to the Government’s credit,
and to that of their professional
advisers, that the Minister managed
to mix tact and firmness in his re-
ferences to Indonesia. He reflected
a great deal of Australian feeling
in saying that he had sought to
promote the friendship of the Aus-
tralian and Indonesian people but
equally he represented a great deal
of Australian feeling in saying
“... but Indonesia cannot expect that
Australia can do other than con-
demn breaches of accepted norms
of international conduct.” He then
went on to say “... We have publicly
stated our support for Malaysia and
our disapprovals Indonesia’s poli-
cies and courses of action towards
Malaysia. We have made Aus-
tralia’s position quite clear through
diplomatic channels and by direct
communications on the part
either of the Prime Minister or my-
self with Ministers in Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines,
Britain, America . .
This is a clear statement of com-
mitment. It is therefore mischie-
vous of the Government’s “hard
line” critics to call for increasingly
bellicose statements against Indo-
nesia. If the Government’s policy
towards Indonesia a series of
firm but friendly warnings of the
future consequences of military
action against Malaysia has no
effect it will be because Djakarta
despises both our military potential
and our friendship or because in
desperation it can see no way out
of internal disaster except through
external adventure. It will not be
because it is in any doubt that we
mean what we say.
“The Group”
AT first sight the decision by Mel-
bourne booksellers to withdraw
from sale Mary McCarthy’s famous
novel “The Group” seems a new
turn in Victoria’s ludicrous censor-
ship history. We are used to Mel-
bourne’s police the best smut-
hounds outside South Africa and the
Soviet Union suddenly seizing
books from shops and proceeding
to destroy them. Now they are more
“civilised” and warn booksellers
before taking any legal action, with
consequent unpleasant publicity and
fines.
In fact, however, although this
seems a more “civilised” procedure,
it avoids the issues. Australian
booksellers and publishers have a
special duty, with the support of
their customers, in this field and
the duty is to fight every case in
the courts, until the police and reac-
tionary Governments are taught a
lesson. American and British ex-
perience and quite a few Aus-
tralian cases show that this is
the way to establish freedom from
censorship, not by meekly with-
drawing books from Melbourne and
sending them interstate for profits.


THIS AUSTRALIA
DEFENCE—!
Fairbairn Confuses
the Issue
The Pensions Fight
O. E. FAIRBAIRN
Misleading?
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
HThe Members of the House of Repre-
"*■ sentatives listened with interest this
month as they were told of a man who
will draw £35,872 for the payment of
only £4830. The Minister for Air, Mr
D. E. Fairbairn, was not describing a
wonderful, new lottery in which every
ticket-holder won a valuable prize, but
was outlining the operation of the De-
fence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme
known as the DFRB under which
Service pensions are paid. He was reply-
ing to Mr Turner (Liberal, NSW), who
had stated the previous day that “there
is seething discontent” in the Armed
Services over the DFRB.
The operation of any superannuation
scheme is almost incomprehensible to any
person who is not an accountant with
specialised insurance training. So, in
reducing the DFRB Scheme to simple
terms, Mr Fairbairn gave the House of
Representatives a somewhat incomplete,
and so misleading, description of the
scheme. The main complaints raised by
the “Critical Group-Captain” (Bulletin,
22/2/64), and other servicemen, were
glossed over rather than answered.
Of the retired serviceman’s pension
cheque, 773 per cent is paid by the
Government from revenue, and the re-
maining 221 per cent comes from the
DFRB Fund. The cause for complaint
is not the Government's 773 per cent
share, which servicemen regard as gener-
ous, but the 223 per cent from the DFRB
Fund. The servicemen claim that not
only do they contribute far more to the
fund than will be required to meet 223
per cent of the cost of their pensions
but also they have had to pay heavily for
past maladministration.
During a serviceman’s career, his
DFRB credit accumulates from his con-
tinuous contributions. In addition it in-
creases as the result of the compound
interest his DFRB credits earn for the
fund. In the case quoted by Mr Fair-
bairn, the serviceman contributes £4830.
But at his date of retirement the total
DFRB credit would be swollen by com-
pound interest to £9500.
When the serviceman retires, he is
not paid his total credit in a lump sum,
but commences to draw on it at an
annual fixed rate. This means the bal-
ance of his credit continues to earn
interest, which prolongs the period re-
quired to use up all the credit. The case
quoted by Mr Fairbairn was that of an
aircrew Group-Captain retiring on
£l,BBB per annum. But of this, the
DFRB Fund only provides 221 p.c., or
£425. To offset this payment, the fund
has the serviceman’s credit of £9500
currently invested at 5| p.c. The
interest from this investment yields £5lO
per annum. But only £425 of this is
required to provide the fund's portion
of the pension, so the remaining £B5
is profit for the DFRB. In other words,
no matter how long the serviceman, or
his widow, survives, his DFRB credit is
not reduced. When they die the £9,500
does not go to their estate but remains to
swell the DFRB Fund, which at the
moment stands at over £l9 million.
Therefore, the very case quoted by Mr
Fairbairn to try to show Parliament that
there is nothing wrong with the DFRB,
actually proves the servicemen's claim
that they are required to contribute at
a much higher rate than necessary. The
only other case quoted by Mr Fair-
bairn was that of an aircrew Squadron-
Leader who contributes £2,900 and
draws a pension of £1165 p.a. At
retirement his DFRB credit is £4,865.
At 51 p.c. this earns £262 per annum.
The fund has to provide £262 of his
annual pension. Hence his DFRB credit
is never reduced.
To prove their claim that they had
to pay heavily for past maladministration
of the DFRB Scheme, the servicemen
recall the immediate past history of the
fund. During 1959, the DFRB Board
discovered that the contributions during
the ’fifties had been too low. After the
necessary legislation had been passed,
the rates were sharply increased. In many
cases they were doubled, in some cases
even trebled! Servicemen unable to pay
these increases, which averaged between
£5 and £lO per fortnight, were permitted
to defer some payments to a later date,
but charged interest.
The patchwork nature of the scheme
has led to many anomalies. In one
case where two officers joined the RAAF
at the same age, and face retirement at
the same time on the same rank to get
the same pension, one of them will have
paid £BOO more than the other.
Many more such anomalies exist. The
Regular Defence Forces Welfare Asso-
ciation knows of more than 100 anoma-
lies which have arisen under the opera-
tion of the DFRB Act. In these circum-
stances, would not Mr Fairbairn be
better advised to launch a full inquiry
into DFRB, rather than to confuse the
issue?
DEFENCE - II
The Retiring Jet Pilot
Army pay and conditions changes?
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
Tt may be some months before the
A legal question of the right of Service
officers to resign in peace-time is re-
solved. It is now certain that the test case
of Captain Marks versus the Common-
wealth will not come on during the
current sitting of the High Court at
Melbourne.
Last week the fact that an RAN
officer had issued a similar writ became
public after service had been accepted
by the Commonwealth. The officer in-
volved is Lt R. C. O'Dea, a jet pilot
instructor, stationed at HMAS Albatross,
Nowra. His resignation was first sub-
mitted last year.
His challenge rests on Section 13a
of the Naval Defence Act (1910) which
has a similar three months’ notice clause
to Section 17 (i) of the Defence Act.
Because of legal procedure, Lt O'Dea
will not be able to apply to the High
Court in Sydney for a date until April
10. As the Court is due to return to


Melbourne in time for May 5, it is
unlikely that his case will be heard for
some time.
If the Marks case does not come on
before the Court leaves Melbourne at
the end of its sitting beginning May
5, some of the Army officers involved
are speaking of issuing a writ in Queens-
land to try and get their case heard.
While the Government has remained
outwardly unperturbed by the recent
criticism, there have been moves in the
Defence Ministries in Canberra. A pro-
gramme of changes in the Army pay
code and conditions has been prepared.
It and other matters were discussed at
a meeting earlier this month between
the three Service Ministers, the Minister
for Defence, Mr P. Hasluck, and the
Prime Minister. A few hours later, Mr
D. defence of the
DFRB Scheme in the House, using, one
supposes, the same brief that he had
taken to the ministerial meeting earlier.
THE CONFRONTATION
Aid for Malaysia
" We mean what we say ”
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
Sir G. BARWICK
Clues
Commonwealth departments, having
been told that the Government
meant what it said when it said it would
assist Malaysia to maintain the integrity
of its territories, are studying the prob-
lems that this could bring in its train.
The Clues mission is back from Mal-
aysia after studying how Australia can
assist Malaysia with its military supply
problems. It has recommended a four-
phase operation. Phase one was the
supply of automatic weapons, light
equipment and ammunition which was
immediately available. Phase two was the
supply of heavier equipment. Phase
three was the seconding of Australian
personnel to the Malaysian forces to
assist in training. Phase four was the
bringing to Australia of Malaysian de-
fence personnel for specialised training.
But the ink was hardly dry on the
recommendations when the Malaysian
announcement of conscription came,
and officials immediately assumed that
help would have to be speeded up and
expanded.
The supply position was not the one
concerning officials nearly as much as
other problems.
So far there has been no actual con-
frontation between Australian troops in
Malaysia and anti-Malaysian forces.
Neither Britain, which is supporting
Malaysia, nor the Malaysian authorities
have yet asked that there should be
such a confrontation. But there is a
normal rotation of troops within the
Commonwealth reserve in Malaysia.
Australian troops are part of this reserve.
In the normal course of events Australian
troops would, as their turn comes up, be
brought into confrontation with the In-
donesian infiltrators into Malaysian ter-
ritory.
Australian authorities hope that
before Australian forces are brought by
the march of events into direct contact
with Indonesian forces, the Indonesian
Malaysian problem will have been settled
by a firm stand on the part of either
the United Nations or the United States.
ROADS
Carve-up in the Dark
How to find priorities
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
'The only Victorians one could find last
JL week who seemed satisfied with the
outcome of the finance carve-up in
Canberra were at the Australian Road
Federation, whose national Executive
Director, Mr P. J. Scales, said that all
would be solved through the medium of
the new Commonwealth Bureau of
Roads, whose establishment the Federa-
tion has been plugging for ten years or
more. Mr Scales told me that not only
would the bureau open up new channels
of providing more finance, say through
borrowing, for roads but would also
solve the vexed question of deciding
national priorities for road expenditure.
This complacent long-term view is
apparently also shared by the Federal
Treasurer, Mr H. E. Holt, who the day
before tacitly admitted to the premiers
that the Government has been flounder-
ing around on the road question for lack
of co-ordinated expert advice. “We are
being called upon every so often to make
major decisions as to how much of the
nation’s resources should be allocated to
roads,” said Mr Holt, “but we cannot
properly handle such a situation and
make such large decisions unless, we,
ourselves have an adequate understand-
ing of the problem.”
The most outspoken comments came
from Mr Bolte who sought to change the
formula for the Commonwealth’s alloca-
tions to the States for roads to allow
more for the heavier concentration of
vehicle ownership and traffic in the more
highly populated States but was firmly
rebuffed. “I’ve been outvoted, out-
gunned and outmanoeuvred,” he boomed
after-the conference.
The £350 million to be allotted to the
States over the next five years may seem
a lot in round terms but in fact this
amount is less than a third of the £l,lOO
million which it is estimated will be
spent on Australian roads in the next five
years. Last year total Australian ex-
penditure on roads come to £l5B million
of which only £54 million came from
Commonwealth funds. This year the
Commonwealth is allocating £5B million
and the grant will rise in stages from
£65 million next year to £B5 million
in 1968-69.
Mr Bolte stated categorically that these
increases in Commonwealth grants will
do no more than look after rising costs
and he unsuccessfully pressed the Federal
representatives to increase petrol fax as
a way to make more funds available. As
he also said after the conference that he
refused to increase taxation (an election
is coming up in mid-year) to find more
funds for roads. Presumably he is content
with the stalemate, which means that
with 40 per cent of Commonwealth
grants still to be spent on rural roads,
Melbourne’s fiasco will continue in-
definitely while Canberra’s ambitious
road building programme to serve a
population of only 70,000 compared with
more than two million in Melbourne
proceeds apace.
One-of the first things the new bureau
should do is to ask the question whether
Australia’s road expenditure matches the
needs of the time. There is little doubt
it does not, though it must of course be
looked at in terms of national aggregates
of capital expenditure on public works.
Roads have to take their proper place in


the order of priorities for all avenues of
capital investment in the public sector.
With roads there has long been a
sort of “make do” mentality so far as old
roads are concerned. Failure to scrap
and rebuild many of these, places a drag
on the efficiency of the economy which
is just as serious as that which results
from the failure to build new roads
where they are needed.
RELIGION
Two-thirds of the Mass
in English
The bishops’ secret decision
FROM MATHEW VAUGHAN IN SYDNEY
CARDINAL GILROY
Reform
HpHOSE critics within the Catholic
Church, who have been expressing
misgivings about the extent to which the
liturgical reforms permitted by the
Vatican Council would be introduced
in Australia, will now have reason to
eat their words. But they should do so
with good will because decisions taken
earlier this month, but still secret, look
like making Australia the leader in the
implementation of such reforms in the
English-speaking world.
The changes will touch the lives of
about 1,750,000 Australians, i.e. the
two-thirds of the Catholic population
who regularly attend Sunday Mass. The
decisions were made at a national con-
ference of bishops meeting in a secluded
retreat house in the Sydney North Shore
suburb of Wahroonga. At the close of
the conference a vague statement in
flowery ecclesiastical language was issued
stating that a decision had been made
for some use of English in the Mass,
but not indicating the extent of the
change. It was stated that the Australian
bishops’ decisions would have to be re-
ferred to Rome for approval, and that
only after that could Catholics be told
the extent of the projected changes.
What the bishops did decide in favour
of was the use of English for two-thirds
of the Mass leaving only the Canon,
the central third, in Latin. Their con-
ference also opened the way for the use
of English in the administration of sacra-
ments, including of course, Confession,
and Marriage.
In making that decision they took the
fullest advantage of the changes allowed
by the Vatican Council votes on the
liturgy. As part of the general trend
for greater responsibility to be given to
local bishops the Council had laid down
the permissible limits for use of the
vernacular but left it to national con-
ferences to decide what changes would
be made within those limits.
While the Australian decision is to
be submitted to Rome for approval any
veto of it, or any other national confer-
ence decision, would seem unlikely.
However, opposition within the Roman
Curia, as all the world now knows, is
still a possible force to be reckoned with.
One of the talking points among the
bishops at their meeting was a docu-
ment issued in the name of Pope Paul
in January which contained some strange
rulings which were opposed, at least in
spirit, to the actual Council Liturgy
Constitution.
Between the return of the bishops to
Australia from the second session of the
Council and their meeting this month
there were a number of statements
which seemed to indicate that Australia
might go-slow on the introduction of
English. Cardinal Gilroy, in an interview
published in the Catholic Press, said
that there would be no radical changes
and virtually hinted that the introduction
of English might be limited to Epistle
and Gospel readings.
But at the same time the Cardinal
circularised all his diocesan priests
(younger curates as well as parish priests)
to ask their opinions on the use of Eng-
lish. He also asked parish priests to
sound their laity. A handful of churches
went as far as to take a public vote. The
priests’ opinions are said to have favor-
ed extensive changes by a big margin.
Where the open votes were taken the
laity were overwhelmingly for change.
(At one church in a new suburb on the
southern side of Sydney in a full con-
gregation only half a dozen stood out
for Latin.)
The bishops at their meeting also had
before them a carefully worded petition
prepared by a group of laymen con-
nected with the “Catholic Worker” in
Melbourne. This petition, perhaps a
little too verbose, was circulated to a
limited group of laymen for signature.
Apart from the influence of his own
soundings on the Cardinal the most de-
cisive factor at the conference (and in
the lobbying before it) was the advocacy
for change of the Archbishop of Hobart,
Dr Young, who tactfully but firmly led
the campaign for maximum use of Eng-
lish.
Significantly last week the appointment
of Dr Young to an international Com-
mission to work out reform of the liturgy
was announced. This Commission will
decide on proposals for changes in the
structure of the Mass and sacraments.
When the Rome approval comes the
Catholic Church in Australia will have to
get under way a well-organised and
planned educational programme for the
change-over into English, which is, of
course, to be accompanied by responses
from the congregation. The actual im-
plementation of English will probably
have to wait until the English-speaking
countries agree on common translations.
The Catholic Church in Australia, except
in limited sectors, has not yet been
touched by the spirit of renewal that the
Church in much of Europe has known
since the last war. But the sweeping
changes in language will bring it into a
new era that is, always providing the
changeover isn’t bungled.

LAW
The “Immunities” of
Broken Hill
A reply to Mr Heffron
BOB BOTTOM
Born and bred
FROM BOB BOTTOM IN BROKEN HILL
T>roken Hill does not break the State's
drinking, gambling and betting
law's, the NSW Premier, Mr R. J. Hef-
fron. said last week. This has given
Broken Hill its biggest laugh for years.
Mr Heffron made his denial in a
letter to the State Opposition leader, Mr.
R. W. Askin, who had asked the ques-
tion last year following a complaint
made to him by the Rev. G. S. Martin,
of the Broken Hill Methodist City Mis-
sion. Mr Heffron based his denial on
an investigation and report made by the
Police Commissioner, Mr Norman Allan.
Mr Heffron's statement has Broken
Hill people puzzled, for nearly every-
body knows that Broken Hill's two-up
school (in the heart of the city in
Crystal Lane), SP betting in hotels and
clubs, two gambling houses in Argent
Street and drinking hours that extend
beyond 1 a.m. on some w'eek days and
operate from 10 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on
Sundays are not myths.
They exist and have existed prac-
tically ever since Broken Hill came into
existence 80 years ago. In fact, the
former Police Commissioner, Mr Colin
Delaney, acknowledged this at the time
of his retirement. As> quoted in my
article in The Bulletin (June 8, 1963),
referred to by Mr Heffron, Mr Delaney
said: “Broken Hill received certain im-
munities from the Government of the
day 25 to 26 years ago. The concessions
were never incorporated in the law, but
they exist!" If he knew, surely Mr Allan
and Mr Heffron know.
It is patently absurd for Mr Allan to
say that I, a reporter born and bred in
Broken Hill, wrote the article before I
went there. Mr Heffron said: “As to
the article which appeared in The Bul-
letin on June 8, 1963, I am advised
by the Commissioner that as a result of
police inquiries made at the time, the
author, Mr Bottom, stated that the
article was written prior to his taking
up his position at Broken Hill; no part
of the article had been based on any
personal knowledge or observations by
him; it was largely a rehash of similar
articles which he had read from time to
time and any additional material in-
eluded consisted of allegations as re-
lated to him by an informant.”
■ It-us quite untrue to say that I had
no personal knowledge of what I wrote
about. I went out of my way to stress
to the Police Superintendent from
Parkes that I had seen everything I
wrote about.
While it is true that the article was
published just prior to my taking up a
new appointment in Broken Hill (where
I had lived and worked all my life apart
from 14 months I had just spent with
a newspaper in Casino) the article was
actually written while 1 was back in
Broken Hill on holidays.
Mr Heffron was right on the mark
when he said the Police Superintendent
from Parkes saw no evidence of any-
thing contrary to the laws during a re-
cent visit. Was this because two-up pro-
prietors, hotelkeepers, bookmakers and
others were instructed beforehand to “go
by the book” for that weekend?
NEW ZEALAND
No Takeover for
“The Dominion”?
But a stranger on the board
FROM AN AUCKLAND CORRESPONDENT
\l7hen, a day before his 33rd birthday,
Mr Rupert Murdoch, managing
director of News Ltd, Adelaide, an-
nounced that he had acquired slightly
more than 25 per cent of the shares in
the Wellington Publishing Co. Ltd, the
takeover battle for the proprietor of
Wellington’s morning newspaper, “The
Dominion”, seemed to be over.
For with Mr Murdoch holding 25 per
cent, Wellington Publishing directors
controlling an estimated 20 per cent and
a hard core of “we'll never sell” share-
holders estimated at another 20 per cent,
it seems certain that no newspaper
organisation, however high its bid, can
wrest control from the present board. It
seems likely, however, that this board
will be augmented by Mr Murdoch, or
his nominee, and that the Adelaide group
will help to put some zip in what New
Zealanders call “The Dom".
By no stretch of imagination could
the “Dom” be called a good paper. Its
layout is bad, its local and national news
coverage poor and its editorial content,
in general, dull. Small wonder that the
paper has lost in popularity, with a
consequent loss of advertising revenue.
Yet, profits did not look too bad with
10 per cent on average funds and 31.1
per cent on capital in the' latest year
to September 30. The explanation: low
depreciation (£29,692) on outdated plant
and little spending on staff. Compared
with other metropolitan dailies, however,
the “Dominion” seemed to lag behind.
It was ailing and people knew it.
First indication of a take-over threat
came in November, when the company
announced a one-for-three bonus issue
and, for no apparent reason, a cash issue
in the same ratio at a premium of
£2 10s. a £5 share.
Clearly, the object was to push up the
shares—and up they went indeed, from
£lB to £25 cum rights and bonus, in-
vestors expecting that the 10 per cent
dividend rate would be held.
Then, on January 16, hidden, typically,
right at the back of the paper, the
“Dominion” announced a takeover bid
by the London Thomson Organisation.
Straight away, the bid of £l6 10s. a
share—only 10s. above the market price
-—looked far too low, putting a value of
only £1,650.000 on the newspaper.
New Zealand newspaper proprietors
were shaken from their complacency.
Aghast about the audacity of a
“foreigner” wanting control of a “fine”
New Zealand paper, they ran to the
Government for protection. And soon
it became clear that the Government
would even be prepared to introduce
emergency legislation to keep the “Dom”
in New Zealand hands.
Mr Murdoch flew to Wellington and
was seen to visit the Prime Minister,
Mr Holvoake. Rumors abounded. Be-
fore News Ltd could put in a “Notice
of Takeover” (as now required under
recent legislation), Wilson and Horton
Ltd, publisher of the NZ “Herald”, put
in a defensive bid, mostly in shares,
worth £l9 13s. 6d. a share. News
followed with £22 a share cash. NZ
Newspapers Ltd, Auckland, not keen to
see its rival get entry into Wellington,
sought to add the “Dom” to its chain
of two metropolitan eveningers, two
large provincial papers and a number of
giveaways by offering shares and a little
cash to a total value of £23 4s. Ha
share. The value of the “Dominion”
had by now risen to £2,320,000.
In a late development Thomson
made a fresh offer increasing his bid to
£stg23 a share. But unless the hard-core
“never sell” holders are shaken the


chances of the man from Fleet Street
don’t look promising. Perhaps to meet
this he has offered guarantees of local
control on policy.
The local proprietors never liked com-
petition and operated several agree-
ments which, while making the industry
more economical for the small fry,
restricted foreign news coverage, ham-
pered development and caused a lot of
frustration.
But Mr Murdoch played his hand well.
Quietly, he bought thousands of shares—■
both through the Stock Exchange and
privately —at around £22. There are
indications that the Wellington Publish-
ing board, adverse to any takeover,
knew about this and silently agreed.
UNIONS
Unity Tickets
A NSW lesson for Victoria
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
YlJhatever policies have been decided
" upon to refurbish the Party’s im-
age, the NSW Executive of the ALP is
obviously keeping them quiet. But its
attitude concerning Unity Tickets was
made perfectly clear at a meeting on
Friday, March 13. After deliberating
for over a month on charges concern-
ing a Unity Ticket in the recent acrimo-
nious elections of the Federated Engine
Drivers’ and Firemen’s Association, the
Executive expelled from the ALP
Messrs W. Lane, FED & FA State Pre-
sident, D. Rees, union organiser, and
FED &FA State Executive member
N. Hockney.
This is what happened. The FED &
FA has long been accused of following
Communist Party policy. After the 1959
elections the officials thought all oppo-
sition was smashed and they were com-
placent about the 1963 elections. Until
nominations were opened it was thought
that the Unity Ticket would be unop-
posed. But at the last minute four
ALP members decided to oppose
the Unity Ticket. These four were
Messrs R. A’Court, J. Cooper,
K. Smith and F. Wells. A’Court, a
long-time member of the ALP, is an
executive member of his branch. Smith
is another long-time member who had
opposed the union leadership before.
Cooper, a relative newcomer to Austra-
lia, is an Englishman who was former-
ly nationally prominent in the British
Labor Party, while Wells is a former
Communist who has been a target for
Communist Party abuse because of his
active opposition to that party.
From then on the full force of what-
The Bulletin, March 21, 1964
ever and whoever backs Unity Tickets
was thrown at them. They were all
branded in speeches and leaflets as will-
ing tools of Santamaria, DLP stooges,
etc. The four men attempted to answer
these charges in a roneod leaflet but
lacking the resources and support en-
joyed by their opponents the task was
beyond them. They were all defeated.
Charge and counter-charges were
then made to NSW State ALP Secre-
tary Colbourne. Charged with stand-
ing on a Unity Ticket were Lane and
Rees (facing their third such charge)
and Hockney who had last year defied
an ACTU ban to attend a meeting of
the Communist-run World Federation
of Trade Unions in East Germany as
an accredited FED &FA “observer”.
In return Hockney and Lane laid two
charges against Wells in that “he dis-
tributed a leaflet purporting to have the
official endorsement of the ALP” and
that he “distributed a roneod leaflet
containing business transacted at a
meeting of the State ALP Executive”.
On these charges Wells was suspended
from the ALP for three months.
But the more important matter is the
determined stand taken by the Execu-
tive on the Unity Tickets. The deci-
sion must have some effect on the bla-
tant state of affairs in Victoria and
should certainly influence events in
several union elections due to be held
this year, one of which is the Waterside
Workers’ Federation.
The only point at which one can
cavil is that permission is still withheld
for suitable ALP unionists to run as
official ALP candidates in union
elections.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Curious Letters
Father, son . and dumping rubbish
FROM AN ADELAIDE CORRESPONDENT
Tt sounds like a trivial matter but be-
hind the decision lies a story which
has rocked political circles in South Aus-
tralia: the decision was the one taken late
last month by Marion Council in subur-
ban Adelaide not to rescind a Health
Committee recommendation adopted by
the Local Board of Health that Mr
B. T. Walsh be prosecuted under Section
783 of the Local Government Act.
The Council had decided last Novem-
ber to prosecute Mr B. T. Walsh for
dumping rubbish in an unauthorised
place. Mr B. T. Walsh is, however, the
son of the State Opposition Leader, Mr
Frank Walsh. On January 29 the
Council, after receiving two letters from
Mr Frank Walsh, had decided to recon-
sider that decision.
The first letter read: —-
“Knowing that you undertook to de-
lay a certain recommendation that was
made by council concerning the above-
named” (Mr B. T. Walsh) “for having
emptied his garbage tin in an unauthor-
ised place, would it be possible for coun-
cil to reconsider its decision and not
proceed with court action in this matter?
“I now take this opportunity to men-
tion that B. T. Walsh is my son and that
the matter of having disposed of the
garbage has caused him a great deal of
concern.
“Further, I desire to inform the coun-
cil that if they nominate a fee the one
that is likely to be involved in this mat-
ter I am prepared to make a dona-
tion accordingly to the District and Bush
Nursing Society”.
The second letter said: —
“I now request that no further con-
sideration be given to any representation
that was made in my correspondence.”
In the event none was given.
There were many upraised eyebrows
in SA in October, 1960, when big, slow-
talking, 63-year-old Frank Walsh became
Leader of the Opposition. Soon after in
a television interview, Frank Walsh was
asked whether he would automatically
become Premier if Labor were elected.
He replied, “They would grab me
with both hands. They would say
‘Frank, you did a mighty job in the in-
terests of South Australia’.”
Despite his shortcomings, Frank Walsh
just missed becoming Premier. The
Labor Party went within one seat of
Government at the last election and
many people believe that if it had had
a young, aggressive leader like Don Dun-
stan, a solicitor whose ability is respected
even by the prominent people he attacks,
the long reign of “Old Tom” Playford
would have ended.
BUSINESS
The Three-party
System
Is it legal?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
T\espite stern warnings from the State
” Attorney - General, Mr Rylah,
stamp trading is expected to break out
in Victoria any day now. This could
be a prelude to its introduction in other
States. Trading stamps are as familiar
as sliced bread to shoppers in the UK
and the USA where the business has a
turnover running into millions of
pounds and dollars annually. It is a
late-comer to Australia, mainly because
of legal prohibitions in most States
particularly in Victoria.

When you choose industrial rubber products durability
is of prime importance. Illustrated are seven striking
examples of the lasting qualities of Goodyear products.
But that is only part of the story. The
choice of a Goodyear product may
begin with many other aspects of its
use: extreme temperature conditions;
the need to withstand prolonged ex-
posure to weather; an unusual use
calling for a special design.
Goodyear meets such demands with
unrivalled world-wide experience in
industrial rubber. It comes to you
through the G.T.M. (Goodyear Tech-
nical Man). He is trained to give you
immediate, expert advice on any pro-
blem, and he is as near as your tele-
phone. When you need the answer to
a question about rubber, call him, or
write to the Goodyear branch in your
State.

ROYAL CEYLON BLEND
UPTON’S: TEA MERCHANTS TO THE WORLD FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY
LIP. 321 B.
The trading stamp in its simplest
form is known to most Australian house-
holds. It is the coupon you save from
a tea packet and when you have a score
or so, these may be exchanged for a
free gift. A similar sales promotion
device is the single coupon clipped from
a packet which entitles the purchaser
to buy a saucepan, salad bowl or some
such object at a concession price.
In the jargon of the stamp business,
these schemes are known as “two-
party” systems because only the custo-
mer and the manufacturer of the goods
are involved. Such schemes are legal
in Victoria, NSW, and Tasmania, but
not in SA, WA or Queensland.
However, the stamp business which
has made such an impact on the retail
trade abroad, not to mention its contri-
bution to newspaper advertising, is the
slightly more complex “three-party
system”. The new party is the trading
stamp company which produces the
stamps, the catalogues of free gifts and
the gifts themselves, as well as organi-
sing the business. The stamp company
sells its stamps to retailers and the re-
tailer gives the stamps to customers in
ratio to their purchases. In Britain a
stamp is given for each 6d. spent, but
the Victorian venture is based on a
stamp for each 2s. expenditure. The
retailer will pay £2 per 1000 stamps
under the Victorian system.
Before Mr Rylah warned that these
schemes were illegal in Victoria, there
had been rumblings from the Associated
Chambers of Commerce in Canberra,
which must have suspected something
was looming up. Early this year it
warned in its newsletter that three-
party schemes were undesirable as they
did not convey free gifts to the con-
sumer, but merely raised distribution
costs.
The Victorian operation is plan-
ned to start any time now and the com-
pany running it has opened a shop in
the Southern Cross Plaza, just along
from Tom the Cheap Grocer, where the
gifts are on display These are mainly
household articles towels, electric
toasters, pots and pans, barbecue tools,
cutlery and toys. The Bulletin was
only able to inspect them through the
window, since the premises were not
open. It is understood that about 600
retailers will be issuing stamps when
the operation gets under way.
However, these three-party schemes
are banned in all Australian States ex-
cept NSW. This was the point of Mr
Rylah’s warning last week and for good
measure he said that if the present law
was inadequate his Government w'ould
consider amending it to drive the stamp
companies out. The operators of the
scheme still believe that they have been
able to draft an agreement with retail-
ers which makes their scheme legal.

If Something’s Big Enough...
Why intellectuals jump on the Beatles 9 bandwagon
From PAUL JOHNSON in London
Mr William Deedes is an Old Harro-
vian, a member of the British
Cabinet and the Minister in charge
of the Government’s information services.
Mr Deedes, it will be remembered, was
one of those five Ministers who inter-
viewed Mr Profumo on that fateful night
and were convinced by him that he had
not slept with Miss Keeler. Now any
public relations man, even a grand one
who sits in the Cabinet, can use a touch
of credulity; but even so I remember
thinking at the time: “Jf Deedes can
believe that, he’ll believe anything.” And
indeed he does! Listen to him on the
subject of the Beatles:
“They herald a culture movement
among the young which may become
part of the history of our time . . .
For those with eyes to see it, some-
thing important and heartening is
happening here. The young are re-
jecting some of the sloppy standards
of their elders, by which far too
much of our output has been gov-
erned in recent years . . . they have
discerned dimly that in a world of
automation, declining craftsmanship
and increased leisure, something of
this kind is essential to restore the
human instinct to excel at some-
thing and the human faculty of dis-
crimination.”
Incredible as it may seem, this was not
an elaborate attempt at whimsy, but a
serious address, delivered to a meeting
of the City of London Young Conserva-
tives, and heard in respectful silence.
Not a voice was raised to point out that
the Emperor wasn’t wearing a stitch. The
Beatles phenomenon, in fact, illustrates
one of my favorite maxims: that if some-
thing becomes big enough and popular
enough and especially commercially
profitable enough—solemn men will not
be lacking to invest it with virtues. So
long as the Beatles were just another
successful showbiz team, the pillars of
society could afford to ignore them,
beyond bestowing the indulgent accolade
of a slot in the Royal Variety Perform-
ance. But then came the shock announce-
ment that they were earning £6,250,000
sterling a year and, almost simul-
taneously, they got the stamp of approval
from America.
This was quite a different matter: at
once they became not only part of the
export trade but an electorally valuable
property. Sir Alec Home promptly
claimed credit for them, and was as
promptly accused by Mr Wilson of
political clothes-stealing. Conservative
candidates have been officially advised
to mention them whenever possible in
their speeches. The Queen expressed
concern about the length of Ringo's hair.
Young diplomats at our Washington
Embassy fought for their autographs.
A reporter described them as “superb
ambassadors for Britain”.
Of course, our society has long been
brainwashed in preparation for this
apotheosis of inanity. For more than
two decades now, more and more in-
tellectuals have turned their backs on
their trade and begun to worship at the
shrine of “pop culture”. Nowadays, if
you confess that you don’t know the
difference between Dizzy Gillespie and
Fats Waller (and, what is more, don’t
care) you are liable to be accused of
being a Fascist.
To buttress their intellectual self-
esteem, these treasonable clerks have
evolved an elaborate cultural mythology
about jazz, which purports to distinguish
between various periods, tendencies and
schools. The subject has been smeared
with a respectable veneer of academic
scholarship, so that now you can over-
hear grown men, who have been expen-
sively educated, engage in heated argu-
ment on the respective techniques of
Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington. You
can see writers of distinction, whose grey
hairs testify to years spent in the cultural
vineyard, squatting on the bare boards
of malodorous caverns, while through the
haze of smoke, sweat and cheap cosmetics
comes the monotonous braying of savage
instruments.
One might, I suppose, attribute such
intellectual treachery to the fact that, in
jazz circles, morals are easy, sex is cheap
and there is a permissive attitude to the
horrors of narcotics. Men are, alas, some-
times willing to debauch their intellects
for such rewards. But I doubt if this is
the real reason. The growing public
approval of anti-culture is itself, I think,
a reflection of the new cult of youth.

Bewildered by a rapidly changing society,
excessively fearful of becoming out of
date, our leaders are increasingly turning
to young people as guides and mentors
—or, to vary the metaphor, as geiger-
counters to guard them against the perils
of mental obsolescence. If youth likes
jazz, then it must be good, and clever
men must rationalise this preference in
intellectually respectable language.
Indeed, whatever youth likes must be
good: the supreme crime, in politics and
culture alike, is not to be “with it”. Even
the most unlikely mascots of the Estab-
lishment are now drifting with the
current: Mr Henry Brooke, for instance,
finds himself appointing to the latest
Home Office committee the indispensable
teenager, who has, what is more, the
additional merit of being a delinquent.
Before I am denounced as a reaction-
ary fuddy-duddy, let us pause an instant
and see exactly what we mean by this
“youth”. Both British TV channels now
run weekly programmes in which popular
records are played to teenagers and
judged. While the music is performed,
the cameras linger savagely over the faces
of the audience. What a bottomless
chasm of vacuity they reveal! The huge
faces, bloated with cheap confectionery
and smeared with chain-store makeup,
the open, sagging mouths and glazed
eyes, the hands mindlessly drumming in
time to the music, the broken stiletto
heels, the shoddy, stereotyped, “with-it”
clothes: here, apparently, is a collective
portrait of a generation enslaved by a
commercial machine.
Shrewd elders at work?
T eaving a TV studio recently, I stum-
bled into the exodus from one of
these sessions. How pathetic and listless
they seemed: young girls, hardly any
more than 16, dressed as adults and
already lined up as fodder for exploita-
tion. Their eyes came to life only when
one of their grotesque idols scarcely
older than they—made a brief appear-
ance, before a man in a camel-hair coat
hustled him into a car. Behind this image
of “youth”, there are, evidently, some
shrewd older folk at work.
And what of the “culture” which is
served up to these pitiable victims?
According to Mr Deedes, “the aim of the
Beatles and their rivals is first class of
its kind. Failure to attain it is spotted
and criticised ruthlessly by their many
highly-discriminating critics.” I wonder
if Mr Deedes has ever taken the trouble
to listen to any of this music?
On the Saturday TV shows, the merits
of the new records are discussed by
panels of “experts”, many of whom seem
barely more literate or articulate than
the moronic ranks facing them. They
are asked to judge each record a “hit” or
a “miss”, but seem incapable of explain-
ing why they have reached their verdict.
Occasionally one of the “experts” betrays
some slight acquaintance with the ele-
mentals of music and makes what is
awesomely described as a “technical”
point: but when such merit is identified
in a record, this is usually found to be
a reason for its certain commercial
failure.
The Ritual
Tn any case merit has nothing to do with
A it. The teenager comes not to hear
but to participate in a ritual, a collective
grovelling to gods who are themselves
blind and empty. “Throughout the per-
formance”, wrote one observer, “it was
impossible to hear anything above the
squealing except the beat of Ringo’s
drums.” Here, indeed, is “a new cultural
movement”: music which not only cannot
be heard but does not need to be heard.
As such I have no doubt that it is, in
truth, “first class of its kind”.
If the Beatles and their like were in
fact what the youth of Britain wanted,
one might well despair. I refuse to
believe it—and so I think will any other
intelligent person who casts his or her
mind back far enough. What were we
doing at 16? I remember the drudgery
of Greek prose and the calculus, but I
can also remember reading the whole of
Shakespeare and Marlowe, writing poems
and plays and stories. It is a marvellous
age, an age of intense mental energy and
discovery. Almost every week one found
a fresh idol—Milton, Wagner, Debussy,
Matisse, El Greco, Proust—some, indeed,
to be subsequently toppled from the
pantheon, but all springing from the
mainstream of European culture. At 16,
I and my friends heard our first perform-
ance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony; I
can remember the excitement even today.
We would not have wasted 30 seconds of
our precious time on the Beatles and their
ilk.
Are teenagers different today? Of
course not. Those who flock round the
Beatles, who scream themselves into
hysteria, whose vacant faces flicker over
the TV screen, are the least fortunate
of their generation, the dull, the idle, the
failures: their existence, in such large
numbers, far from being a cause for
ministerial congratulation, is a fearful
indictment of our education system,
which in 10 years of schooling can
scarcely raise them to literacy.
What Mr Deedes fails to perceive is
that the core of the teenage group—the
boys and girls who will be the real
leaders and creators of society tomorrow
—never go near a pop concert. They are,
to put it simply, too busy. They are
educating themselves. They are in the
process of inheriting the culture which,
despite Beatlism or any other mass-pro-
duced mental opiate, will continue to
shape our civilisation. To use Mr
Deedes’ own phrase though not in the
sense he meant it, they are indeed “re-
jecting some of the sloppy standards of
their elders”. Of course, if many of these
elders in responsible positions surrender
to the Gadarene Complex and seek to
elevate the worst things in our society
into the best, their task will be made
more difficult. But T believe that, despite
the antics of Cabinet Ministers with
election nerves, they will succeed.

Making Greek theatre
live again
By CHARLES SRIBER
A ncient Greek drama is hardly every
Australian's cup of tea. News that
visiting Athenian director Costis
Michaelides has reached agreement with
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust for an
Australian tour probably has created
only a minor ripple. But it would be
a shame if only dedicated theatre ad-
dicts were interested. Any of the many
Australians who have witnessed produc-
tions at Epidaurus's ancient theatre or
the 2000-year-old theatre of Herod
Atticus in Athens were probably sur-
prised at the enjoyment they got from
the experience.
Costis Michaelides at 51 is considered
among Greece's leading producers. Long
with the National or Royal Theatre, he
struck out with his own company last
year and many of the Royal people join-
ed him. A quiet-spoken man whose
English is limited, he becomes heated
only when lashing out at hidebound
notions of producing Greek drama. His
wife, Mary Aroni, is still with the
National company and he stresses that
his relations with Greece's number one
official theatre are not acrimonious.
When I spoke with him agreement
had been reached in principle for an
Australian tour and talks with Trust
director Stefan Haag revolved only
around dates.
Stocky, blue-eyed and with a youthful
energy, Michaelides is no pompous im-
presario. “If anything really remains of
our drama,” he said, “it must be the
heritage of the ordinary people. They
continue it in their customs and habits.”
Then he thought again and corrected
himself, “Perhaps not all the people
not so much the city dwellers. Even
Athenians are very much like the resi-
dents of any other city, although the
poorer quarters still hold on to some-
thing.”
As he sees it, the lives of the villagers
and islanders carry on traditions to be
found in drama written 2400 years ago.
“You see it in their ritual and their feast
days and dances,” he said. “When they
hold a ‘panagia’—you know, the country
festival dances, songs and the stories
still follow a pattern. Even the threshing-
floor scene of so many of these feasts
is similar to the round chorus area
which in turn developed from the ancient
threshing floors.”

Alice in Wage Land
Big problems in basic pay increases
By J. C. HORSFALL
rVTo my mind all the arguments
raised by the unions about whether
the economy has the capacity to
pay a higher basic wage are secondary
to the prime consideration of keeping
whatever rise in the basic wage is
awarded by the Arbitration Commission
within the limits of what would, through
its independent effects, result in a
higher general level of prices.
Equally it seems that employers’
arguments that a wage increase would
raise costs are also of secondary im-
pbrtance, so long as the adjustment to
the basic wage does not warrant them
passing it on in prices.
As counsel for the employers put it
last week, “the Commission has the
opportunity, and perhaps at the most
appropriate time in the history of this
tribunal, to establish a pattern of wage
fixation that will win the approval of
responsible employers and unions alike
and which will enable the growth in the
economy to proceed at stabilised prices
to the benefit of all sections of the
community”.
In his turn, counsel for the Common-
wealth also put the emphasis on main-
taining stability: “Perhaps the main
queries about the forward situation are
whether, on the one hand, demand in
the shape of overall expenditure will
rise to a point at which shortages of
labor become highly acute, various
branches of productive capacity are
strained, and imports rise to insupport-
able levels; and whether, on the other
hand, stability of prices and costs will
give place to inflation. Though men-
tioned separately, these two possibili-
ties are to a large extent inter-related
aspects of one course that developments
could take. It is against the background
of these two main queries that the pos-
sible impact of a basic wage increase
has to be considered.”
During the 1950 s it was more or less
expected by the community that retail
prices would rise. We became tolerant
of a degree of inflation until, in 1960,
prices looked as if they might run away
and ordinary people found it difficult
to keep in the race to maintain their
real incomes. Since then there has
been a 12s. a week rise in the basic
wage (1961) and a 10 per cent rise in
margins (1963) to assist the mainten-
ance of spending power.
On top of these adjustments to the
minimum wage and margins there have
been increases in over-award payments
resulting from the interplay of supply
and demand forces in the labor market.
The upshot is that while retail prices
have been relatively stable, average
weekly earnings have risen quite a lot.
For instance, in the twelve months to
June, 1962, average weekly earnings
rose by 3.9 per cent and in the next
twelve months to June, 1963, by a
further 2.8 per cent. The latest figures
indicate that in the September quarter
of 1963 average weekly earnings were
3.7 per cent higher than a year earlier,
and that over that year the consumer
price index rose by only .8 per cent.
On this showing, average weekly earn-
ings have risen sufficiently to provide
an increase in real incomes for the
average worker, who can consider him-
self to have taken his fair share of the
increase in productivity over the period.
But the same doesn’t necessarily apply
to those on the minimum weekly wage.
For instance, whereas average weekly
earnings per male employed rose by
17s. 7d. in the twelve months to last
September quarter, the average mini-
mum wage for adult males increased by
less than half that amount, actually
Bs. sd.
Tt is a reasonable conclusion that
A since there was little change in the
hours worked by labor in all industries
in the year to August, 1963, the latest
figures available, over-award payments
rather than overtime accounted for.
most of the increase in real average
earnings over the period, and that those
on the minimum wage naturally missed
out.
The paradox of the current case, as
for many of the previous ones, is that
whereas the unions are applying for an
increase in the basic wage, any increase
awarded will not only apply to mini-
mum wages, for which a rise seems to
be warranted, but it will also go to
practically every wage-earner in the
country, most of whom on the above
figures have enjoyed their fair share
of the rise in productivity that has taken
place and, thanks to this and also to
the stability of prices, whose real wages
have risen substantially since the last
increase in the basic wage in 1961.
In saying this, one is not denying
that there is room for argument as to
whether in fact a fair share of the in-
creased productivity since 1961 has
accrued to the work force, or even as
to whether, on equity grounds, the work
force is entitled to a bigger share of the
gross national product. One is argu-
ing simply that, minimum wages aside,
the bidding up of wage payments in
the open market has already reached a
stage in the current upswing of employ-
ment where the margin of increased
productivity available for distribution in

higher wages, either through market
forces or through the Arbitration Com-
mission, has been greatly narrowed,- and
that despite rising company incomes we
are approaching the stage where employ-
ers would be obliged to pass on sub-
stantial new additions to company wage
bills in higher prices to consumers.
Furthermore, the additional income
so distributed in wages could well push
effective demand to levels which would
lift prices of goods on that account also.
So the threat to price stability is posed
from both supply and demand sides.
If this view is taken, then the crucial
consideration for the Commission is to
determine the sensitivity of current
prices to various rates of increase in the
basic wage. This, in effect, requires an
exhaustive examination not only of the
current and potential money-goods
balance in the economy as a whole but
also of the present potency of the fac-
tors which have been keeping prices
stable over the last three years and of
profit margins over the whole of indus-
try to show what scope existed in in-
dustry for absorbing higher wage bills
without increasing prices.
Counsel for the Commonwealth assist-
ed the Commission on both these
grounds but, probably wisely, did not
attempt to lead it too firmly, contenting
himself with the final observation that,
taking into account all the circumstances
now facing us, it would be “incautious”
to take any decision except on the as-
sumption that a wage increase would
have an effect on the general level of
prices, the effect being related to the size
of the increase.
Indelicate balance
TJS/hat he was saying, in effect, was that
a wage increase of an unspecified
magnitude would produce inflationary
effects in a situation where effective de-
mand and goods were in delicate balance.
One might have put it a little more
strongly and added that, going on pre-
vious periods of flush export income,
and even discounting a strong change
in spending and saving habits, an infla-
tionary potential already exists in the
economy; and for that reason it would
be injudicious, to say the least, to spark
off any translation of this into an in-
crease in effective demand by a big in-
crease in wages when already increases
in productivity over the last three years
(since the 1961 increase of 12s. in the
basic wage) have already been absorbed
by average earnings throughout the em-
ployment structure.
Despite the fact that prices have been
stable thus far in the current swing to-
wards the full employment of resources,
it would be silly to deny the existence of
this inflationary potential or the possibi-
lity that a big rise in the basic wage
would bring it into action. The inflation-
ary potential is there all right, and not
all of the factors which have been pre-
venting its emergence in the last couple
of years are still effective.
As the Commonwealth's counsel point-
ed out to the Commission, certainly
trading is still very competitive and im-
port competition is still very much in
evidence, but demand for goods and
labor has become very much stronger.
“Overtime working, as well as other over-
award payments, are now very wide-
spread, and it would not be wise to
assume that the cost of the extra week's
annual leave granted in 1963 has been
absorbed. It also seems probable that
the scope for special economies achieved
during the recession has been more or
less used up. Even though the margin
increases and extra week’s annual leave
do not seem to have had so far much
effect on prices, it would be testing for-
tune to assume that if there were loaded
on to them a further general wage in-
crease at this stage the conditions of
price stability that we have known over
the past few years would be likely to
continue”.
Obviously, he said, much would de-
pend on the size of the increase, and he
proceeded to show what the Govern-
ment thinks would be the scope for pass-
ing on the added cost of a wage increase
in higher prices. As he said, neither the
exporting industries nor local industries
facing import competition would be able
to pass the increase on, whatever its size.
The implication here would be a re-
duction in competitiveness for both these
categories of industry, with, at the mo-
ment one must presume, rural export
industries, which are now enjoying very
high prices having far greater scope for
absorbing an increase than local manu-
facturers facing import competition. N
However, the point was made later that
export prices are subject to wide fluctu-
ation and current high prices could well
be only temporary . . .
“It is well to remember that, not only
can conditions affecting both rural pro-
duction and rural exports change quickly
and drastically for the worse, they are
in the position, by contrast with indus-
tries exclusively serving domestic mar-
kets, that they cannot pass cost increases
on. While productivity in these indus-
tries will doubtless continue to improve
and while with larger volume of produc-
tion there is a tendency for unit costs
of output to fall, they are continually
being overtaken by the rising trend of
factor costs like wages, interest on capi-
tal, and so on. While, therefore, these
industries or the great majority of them
have been having a favorable run, the
Commonwealth submits that it is still
highly necessary to pay particular re-
gard to the effects a wage increase may
have on the fundamental conditions
within which they have to produce and
sell”.
Overstating the urgency
npuRNiNG to other industries, counsel
A said that for some there might be a
matter of necessity that an increase be
passed on and for others it might be a
matter of choice. “If an increase were
relatively small they might decide for
marketing or other reasons to carry it
against profits. If an increase was larger
the decision might be to pass it on, either
wholly or in part. What part producti-
vity would play, only those engaged in
the heart of industry could know, and
then probably after the event.
“In industries where productivity is
rising or where, jwith increasing scales of
output, unit costs are tending to fall,
there would be an offset to the wage in-

crease. Not all industries by any means
would be in that position but, even for
those who are, the size of an increase
would be important for the decision on
pricing. Clearly there are many factors
in the problem which cannot be judged
with any confidence. It would be incau-
tious, taking account of all the circum-
stances now facing us, to take any de-
cision except on the assumption that a
wage increase would have an effect on
the general level of prices, the effect be-
ing related to the size of an increase”.
However, it seems to me that the Com-
monwealth, being probably more anxious
to preserve stability than either of the
parties to the current wage case, has
rather overstated the urgency with which
the majority of companies would move
to raise prices in the event of a wage in-
crease, always assuming the Commission
acts sensibly and makes a tolerable
increase. My personal fears of the pos-
sible emergence of inflation following an
increase in the basic wage lie more on the
side of increasing effective demand be-
yond containable levels and on the pos-
sibility that a rise in prices by that route
would induce a change in spending and
saving habits which would accelerate the
rise in prices.
This aspect was also commented on
by the Commonwealth’s counsel. “Turn-
ing now to the direct effects of a wage
increase on demand, we can take it that
this would be something less than the
total amount added to wage and salary
incomes. Part of the increase would
be taken in taxation and part would go
to repayment of debts. Part also would
be saved, at least for the time being
although it might be spent as time went
on, on the strength of the increase in
earnings. Some would doubtless seek
to buy more on credit, and that would
add to expenditure.
Canberra inadequacy
“As to how far an increase would cause
an early lift in spending, no one
can really be sure. We can, however, be
sure that there would be some addition
to the demand for goods in the period
following a wage increase, and this would
have some cumulative effects both on in-
comes and further expenditure; again,
however, its economic significance would
depend, first, on the size of that increase
and, second, and perhaps most import-
antly, on the trend of demand in general
at the time. If this were already tend-
ing to rise to excess, even a relatively
small addition to it could have serious
effects”.
From this it seems that the Common-
wealth is not as concerned about the
build up of effective demand as it should
be, and it seems to have missed an op-
portunity to make out the full case
against increasing wages from this vital
aspect, when, one would have thought,
its economic experts would have supplied
the Commission with a more definite
prospectus of the money-goods situation
instead of simply reciting an unco-
ordinated series of statistics relating to
it.
This possibility shows up the inade-
quacy of the departments responsible in
Canberra, where one would have thought
there would be a team of experts con-
tinually engaged in examining this vital
aspect, vital both to the Arbitration Com-
mission and also for Treasury budgeting.
In view of this failure to press home
before the Commission indisputable
arguments that the main threat to stabil-
ity is from the side of effective demand,
it is a pity that the employers have spent
so much time in the present case arguing
the claims of the total wage concept,
which, for all its merits, the Common-
wealth itself refuses to accept and the
unions are hostile about. It is the more
a pity because, on the showing of the
authorities thus far in their efforts to
contain excess liquidity and general
determination to prevent price inflation,
the economy stands a very good chance,
in the absence of a big wage increase,
of going along on an even keel and
reaching into higher realms of solid
growth.
The dual process of bidding up the
price of labor in the market and estab-
lishing progressively higher platforms
through increases in the basic wage and
margins, from which labor can increase
its price in step with the growing short-
age both of skilled and unskilled labor,
is a luxury that an economy searching
higher vistas of growth can’t afford. For
in the conditions of vigorous investment
now operating, and which must be con-
tinued to achieve growth targets, the
resultant wage inflation from the dual
process can only lead to diseconomies
in the industrial structure which them-
selves will prejudice growth.
In an article on the ABC of inflation,
a recent issue of the “Economist” says
that the worst type of inflation occurred
in a situation where the last few hundred
millions of effective demand can actually
push the real national income down
through the creation of industrial bottle-
necks created by the pressure on re-
sources to satisfy the excess of demand.
We have to face the fact that this could
become the situation here in the event of
a big increase in effective demand created
by a large increase in the basic wage,
because income generation along the
whole front has never been stronger and
a huge reserve of spending power re-
sides in the massive accumulations of
savings resulting from cautious spending
by the public over the last three years.
The third stage
HPhe second worst stage in inflation,
stated the “Economist”, is when it be-
comes easy for individual businesses to
pass on prices or to accept without
serious resistance increases in costs. This
situation is reached also through demand
being excessive. But as well as being
a function of the level of total demand,
these courses also depend on the level
of competition in the economy. Happily,
and this is a by-production of the re-
cession here as well as of a generally free
competitive system and success achieved
thus far in preventing excess liquidity
being translated into excess demand,
neither of the above courses are yet pre-
valent in this country, but, as counsel
for the Commonwealth emphasised, they
could well follow an increase in the
basic wage.
It would seem that we are near what
the “Economist” calls the third stage of
inflation, when booming demand leads
to shortages of unemployed labor,
which in turn leads to the bidding up
of the price of labor in the market.
“It has become almost taken for grant-
ed”, says the “Economist”, that (in
Britain) an inflationary spiral is likely
to set in first, with rises in the price of
labor, before demand is necessarily high
enough to trigger off major rises in the
prices of manufactured goods. The
trade unions manage to set a basic rate
for rises in money incomes each year
(this is what the employers here are try-
ing to do through their total wage con-
cept!) and normal bidding up through
the market then takes place on top of
that base level. The two together then
exceed the rate of rise in total output
and price inflation results”.
Without being in that situation yet,
it would seem that we have the appropri-
ate economic setting in which it could
develop.

The Dreadful Riddle
Of Dallas
Did Oswald kill President Kennedy?
From MORDECAI BRIENBERG in Los Angeles
(Mr Brienberg, a Canadian Rhodes Scholar, lectures in Sociology
at Berkeley, California)
THhere are two widely held interpreta-
tions of President Kennedy’s assas-
sination and the events in Dallas. The
“liberal” position contends that Lee
Harvey Oswald was a product of the
hatred and the violence preached by
“extremists of all kinds”. In this view,
radicals of the right and the left are
responsible for the assassination. The
“conservative” interpretation traces re-
sponsibility for the assassination to “left-
ists and Communists” alone; for, they
contend, “was not Oswald a professed
Marxist?” But more crucial than the
differences in these two postures are
their similarities. Both presume that
Lee Harvey Oswald was, in fact, guilty of
the murder of the President; both by-pass
an examination of whether or not this
assertion is demonstrable.
Some very few Americans have taken
seriously the tradition that a man is
presumed innocent until proven guilty.
These individuals have attempted to
assess the evidence in the case. My
purpose in this article is to summarise

their minority inquiries, in order to make
more widely known some pertinent
information.
The complete case against Lee Harvey
Oswald is contained in the FBI and
Secret Service report submitted to the
Warren Commission, which is unavail-
able to the public. However, the essence
of the “water-tight case” against Oswald
was presented in a nation-wide radio
and television statement made by the
District Attorney of Dallas, Henry
Wade. This statement was made after
Oswald was murdered, while still in
police custody. The FBI and the Secret
Service have themselves “leaked” to the
news media information from their own
subsequent investigations. What follows
is a brief resume of the official recon-
struction of the assassination.
Lee Harvey Oswald, positioned at the
sixth-floor window of the Texas School
Book Depository building (TSBD), fired
three rifle shots at the President’s car
as it was moving away from the building.
The President was struck twice, once in
the neck and once in the head; Governor
Connally of Texas was struck once.
This occurred between 12.30 and 12.31.
Oswald then walked down four flights
of stairs to the second floor of the build-
ing, where he took a coke from the
coke-machine. A policeman who rushed
into the building immediately after the
shooting approached Oswald, selecting
him from among several persons
gathered around the coke-machine. But
the owner of the TSBD, who was ac-
companying the policeman, intervened
and stated that Oswald “works in the
building”. Presumably satisfied by this
comment, the policeman discontinued
his interrogation and ran to the sixth
floor. It is only after this brief en-
counter with the law that Oswald is
alleged to_ have fled the building itself.
He supposedly walked several blocks to
catch a bus, which he rode for several
more blocks; he then hailed a taxi and
rode four miles to his apartment. After
taking a jacket from his room, he left;
and some time later he shot a police-
man, Officer Tippit. Finally, it is
alleged, Oswald entered a movie theatre
where his “suspicious movements”
caused the cashier to call for the police.
It was in the theatre that Oswald was
arrested.
The official account of the Kennedy
assassination consists of assertions about
(a) the murder weapon; ( b ) the place
from which the shots were fired, and
the number of shots fired; (c) the escape
of the alleged assassin; and (d) the mur-
der of Officer Tippit. I will critically
examine each aspect in turn, question-
ing the plausibility of the official account
and pointing out the significant dis-

crepancies that appear when earlier ex-
planations are matched against the final
account that I have just outlined.
(a) Weapon
HThere is on file in Dallas an affidavit
by the police officer who found a
rifle on the sixth floor of the TSBD.
That affidavit states that the weapon
was a 7.65 mm. Mauser. Wade, on
November 22, stated that this was the
murder weapon, and that Oswald’s
palm-print was found on the weapon.
The next day the FBI released a report
that Oswald had purchased a rifle in
March under the alias Hiddel. But this
rifle was a 6.5 mm. Italian carbine. After
this report, Wade reversed his position;
the rifle he had in his possession was now
an Italian carbine; it was no longer a
Mauser. It was also after this FBI
report that Wade announced that he
knew Oswald used the alias Hiddel
because he had found an identification
card in this name on Oswald’s person
at the time of his arrest. But Wade
did not explain why this alias was not
released the previous day when he had
asserted that Os-
wald used the alias
Lee. The omission
is most puzzling
when one considers
that the alias Lee
was not immedi-
ately accessible to
the Dallas authori-
ties (as was the alias Hiddel), but had to
be uncovered by a separate investigation.
Aside from questions about the rifle
itself and the alias under which it was
purchased, what evidence is there that
Oswald fired the rifle? The results of
paraffin tests, administered to Oswald
to determine whether or not he had
recently fired a weapon, are on record
in Dallas. While positive results in
such tests can be produced by contact
with substances other than gunpowder,
negative results definitely indicate that
a person has not recently fired a wea-
pon. The firing of a rifle leaves gun-
powder traces on the hands and face,
if it is fired from the shoulder. And
it would seem rather ridiculous for a
person to have fired a rifle with tele-
scopic sights from the hip. The results
of the paraffin tests were positive for
Oswald’s right and left hands. The
paraffin tests on Oswald’s face proved
negative. Moreover, contrary to Wade’s
assertion on November 22 about palm-
prints, the FBI now states that “no
palm-prints were found on the rifle”.
(b) Scene of the Shooting
The crucial question here is to reconcile
the nature of the wounds inflicted
on the President with the unwavering
contention that the shots were fired
from the Texas School Book Depository
building. Let us follow the changing
official reports as they attempt such a
reconciliation.
The three doctors who attended the
President at Parkland Memorial Hospi-
tal immediately after the shooting stated
to reporters at the hospital that one of
the bullets had entered the President’s
throat “just below the Adam’s apple”.
There is a great difference between an
entrance and an exit wound, and all
three doctors claimed to have dealt
daily with gun wounds. The bullet,
these doctors further stated, ranged
downward without exiting. If the Pre-
sident had been shot as his car ap-
proached the TSBD along Houston
Street, then the nature of the throat
wound would be consistent with the
allegation that the shots were fired from
the sixth floor of that building. This
was the first FBI interpretation. But
all the witnesses as well as the photo-
graphs of the shooting make clear that
the car had already made the turn and
was heading towards the overpass when
the first shot was fired in the President’s
throat. Photo-
graphs indicate his
car was seventy-five
to one hundred
yards past the
building. The FBI
next argued that
the President had
turned his head
around (almost 180 degrees) and was
looking back when the first shot was
fired. Mrs Connally contradicted this
by stating that she was speaking to the
President immediately before he was
shot and she was sitting directly in
front of Mrs Kennedy. The films also
show the President facing forward as
the first shot struck him. How, then,
can a bullet shot from behind enter
Kennedy’s throat from the front?
If the place of the shooting is fixed,
if the posture of the President is fixed,
then the consistency of the final account
can only be achieved by altering the
initial interpretation about the nature
of the President’s wound. After the
three physicians were questioned by the
FBI they issued a statement reversing
their earlier view on which they had
been unanimous and definite. The
throat wound, they now say, is an exit
wound. These doctors state that they
are, however, unable to talk to reporters
or to discuss the matter further.
But there remain other pieces of in-
formation which officials have not re-
conciled with the latest statement of the
doctors. The first police bulletin, over-
heard by a reporter waiting for the
President’s motorcade at a point farther
along the route, was that “all firing
appears to have come from the over-

pass” in front of the car. The first
radio account of the assassination stated
that a policeman rushed to the overpass
and was seen chasing two persons on
the overpass. Ominously, nothing fur-
ther is ever mentioned about this report.
The front windshield of the President’s
car had a bullet hole in it. The Secret
Service prevented reporters at the hos-
pital from coming close enough to de-
termine the direction of the bullet. The
car was then flown back to Washington
and remained in the custody of the
Secret Service. Eight days later, the
windshield of the car was replaced. (It
is not known whether the shattered
windshield was destroyed.) Finally,
four reporters of the Dallas “Morning
News”, witnesses to the assassination,
who were standing between the overpass
and the TSBD, all claim that the shots
were fired from in front of the Presi-
dent’s car.
How many shots were. there alto-
gether? According to the official re-
port three shots were fired. But there
appears to be five bullets. A frag-
mented bullet was found in the car (this
is most likely the bullet which struck
the President in the head and then
exited); there was the bullet that
“struck” the President in the throat;
there was the bullet that struck Gover-
nor Connally; there was the bullet
found by the Secret Service on a
stretchei, presumably the President's
(although its origin is by no means de-
finite); and there was a bullet found by
a Dallas policeman in the grass at the
point where the other shots struck the
President and the Governor. Did
Oswald now fire five shots in five and a
half seconds, when rifle experts are
highly sceptical that an excellent marks-
man could have accurately fired three
shots in that time?
(c) The Escape
Ts it possible for Oswald to have done
A everything the official account attribu-
tes to him between the time of the shoot-
ing and his arrival at his apartment?
The shooting took place between 12.30
and 12.31. Oswald arrived at his
apartment, according to his landlady, at
12.45. Another account states he
arrived at 1 p.m. This report also
mentions “choked downtown traffic”.
According to the official version,
Oswald’s taxi ride was about four miles.
In uncongested traffic, the taxi could
average twenty miles per hour, and the
journey would then take twelve minutes.
Thus, if Oswald arrived at 12.45, he
would have had two minutes to («) hide
the weapon; ( b ) walk from the sixth to
the second floor; (c) find coins and get
a coke from the machine; (d) converse
with a policeman; (e) leave the building
and walk four blocks to a bus; (/) ride
the bus several blocks; and (g) get off

the bus and hail a taxi. But if the
traffic were congested, a taxi could only
average about ten miles per hour. Even
if we allow that Oswald did not arrive in
this case until 1 p.m., he would still
have not more than five minutes to
accomplish these same acts.
It does not seem too plausible that
the alleged sequence of events could
have taken place within the allotted
time. But official reversals cast even
further doubt on the validity of their
interpretations. According to Wade’s
first account, the taxi-driver who picked
up Oswald was named Darryl Click.
But when private investigation indicated
that Mr Click had never driven a taxi
in Dallas, District Attorney Wade re-
versed his statement. The name of the
taxi-driver was now given as one Wil-
liam Walev.
If Oswald were the assassin, what
motive would he have for returning to
his apartment? Was it only to pick up
his jacket, which is the police account?
Mrs Kennedy complained that after-
noon of the “sweltering heat”. If
Oswald was returning to facilitate his
escape, why, then,
did he leave 150
dollars in the dres-
ser of his room? He
only had thirteen
dollars in his pocket
when he was ar-
rested. For a man
who had sup-
posedly planned the assassination and
carried it out so successfully, he was
remarkably “unplanned” and chaotic in
making his “escape”.
(d) Murder of Tippit
/"Oswald, it should be remembered, was
first arrested for the murder of
Officer Tippit. This, too, was a “water-
tight case”. District Attorney Wade
claimed that he had sent twenty-three
men to the electric chair on less evi-
dence than that which he had against
Oswald. After making several con-
flicting statements about where Tippit
was shot, Wade ultimately acknow-
ledged he didn’t know the scene of the
crime. The one witness of the Tippit
murder has sworn an affidavit descri-
bing the murderer as “short, stocky,
and with bushy hair”. I would describe
Oswald, from the pictures I have seen,
as slight, balding, and perhaps short.
And what of the pistol with which
Tippit was murdered? No statement
was made by the police as to whether
the pistol found on Oswald at the time
of his arrest was the pistol which fired
the shots killing Tippit. A strange
omission in a “water-tight case”. Wade
did claim, however, that the police had
a marked bullet which “mis-fired” when
Oswald supposedly tried to kill the
arresting officer. The policeman him-
self gave a different account of *the
arrest, stating that he prevented Oswald
from firing the pistol at all by placing
his finger behind the trigger before
Oswald could pull it. Confronted by
the contradiction, Wade yet again
changed his version to accord with that
of the policeman. Thus at one moment
Wade claims to have a marked bullet
in his possession; the next moment he
denies he has such physical evidence.
In the Tippit case, as in the Kennedy
case, there is distortion, a reversal of
interpretations and a mishandling of
crucial physical evidence.
It might be argued in defence of the
investigating agencies that in the atmos-
phere of excitement that followed
Kennedy’s assassination contradictions
and imprecisions were due to “honest”
confusion. Granted that confusion
existed, why, then, should the officials
be continuously certain of one thing,
Oswald’s guilt? Why is Oswald’s pre-
sumed guilt the constant in this sea of
incomplete and conflicting evidence?
Now, supposedly, the confusions have
been clarified into a single consistent
and convincing ac-
count. But if the
case is convincing
and consistent, why
should witnesses re-
fuse to comment to
the Press after they
have been ques-
tioned by the FBI?
Why has Marina Oswald been held in
the custody of the Secret Service since
the murder of her husband more than
two months ago? She has had no
direct and personal contact with any of
her friends, with her mother-in-law, or
with any reporter. Every communica-
tion to her, and every statement by
her, first passes through s the hands of
a public-relations officer and a lawyer
appointed “in her interest” by the
Secret Service. Why, if the case is so
convincing, has physical evidence, such
as the windshield of the President’s car,
been unavailable for public examina-
tion? An alternative hypothesis to that
of “honest” confusion is the hypothesis
that the initial confusion and the pre-
sent secrecy are attributable to incon-
gruities between the presumption of
Oswald's guilt and the inadequacy and
intransigence of the evidence which
would validate such a presumption.
And if the evidence is “intransigent”,
as a critical examination of the official
account seems to demonstrate, why
have the Dallas police, the FBI and the
Secret Service been so unrelenting in
their efforts to prove Oswald's guilt? In
the pressure for an arrest, did the Dallas
police consider Oswald an appropriate
scapegoat because he was first on their
list of “subversives”?
The Federal agencies may have
different motives. One hypothesis,
which certainly cannot be conclusively
demonstrated, suggests that Oswald
worked for Federal investigatory agen-
cies such as the FBI and the CIA. This
hypothesis seeks to account for other-
wise unexplained incidents in Oswald’s
life. While Oswald was employed he
worked at minimum wages; but more
frequently he was unemployed. Yet
somehow he had the financial resources
to travel to Mexico, to print political
literature privately, and to pay a steno-

grapher to transcribe a book critical of
the Soviet Union which he was writing.
The FBI early acknowledged that
Oswald regularly received money
through the mail; but it has not yet
stated the source. If the money came
from a “left-wing” organisation, what
reason would the FBI have for keeping
this secret? Oswald had in his posses-
sion the private phone number and the
automobile licence number of the FBI
official in charge of “subversives” in
Dallas. This information is not ob-
tainable from the telephone directory.
Moreover, the agent had contacted
Oswald several times before.
Passports are not quickly granted;
and Cuban sympathisers have found
them particularly difficult to obtain.
But despite Oswald’s “defection” to the
Soviet Union, despite his activity in the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, he Was
able to obtain a passport “within a
single day”. With this passport he tra-
velled to Mexico City to try to obtain
visas for Cuba and the Soviet Union.
Both countries refused entrance.
Most striking is the fact that Oswald
was not under surveillance during the
President’s visit. Supposedly, the great-
est security precautions ever taken to
protect a President were instituted in
Dallas. (The night before Kennedy’s
arrival, posters were pasted which
showed front and side views of the
President under the caption: “Wanted
Dead or Alive”.) People who advo-
cated integration of Texas schools were
under surveillance, but this “Marxist”,
“defector”, “pro-Castroite” was un-
watched. One is led to ask: is the FBI
trying to close the case in order to hide
the fact that Oswald was in their em-
ploy, or in the employ of another in-
vestigatory agency?
The Warren Commission which
includes Allen Dulles, former head of
the CIA; John McCloy; Senator Russell
of Georgia; Congressman Boggs of
Louisiana; Senator Cooper of Kentucky;
Congressman Ford of Michigan
might be a source of some consolation
if it were probing for an answer to these
worrisome questions. Ironically, the
Commission provokes more questions
about its own operation than it allays
about the operation of other agencies.
Its hearings are conducted in secret;
and it appears to be restricting itself to
a re-examination of the FBI and Secret
Service evidence. The accused’s con-
stitutional rights to due process of the
law, to public trial, to a defence attor-
ney, to the cross-examination of prose-
cution evidence and witnesses all
these safeguards institutionalised in
court procedure have been ignored in
the hearing of this Commission. Why,
one must again ask, does the Warren
Commission judge in camera, and by
such arbitrary procedures?
The Cyprus Cauldron
Hatred, prejudice, unrealistic demands
From IVAN YATES in Nicosia
The United Nations is inheriting an
intractable problem in grisly cir-
cumstances. The fear and distrust
in Cyprus is almost palpable. Rumors
and false reports fly from village to
village. Each community blames the
other for starting every incident. Each
regards the motives of the other in the
worst possible light. Even the most in-
telligent rational men see things in black
and white.
This climate hardly makes for a speedy
solution. Yet time is not on the side of
a settlement. The longer present attitudes
are allowed to harden, the more difficult
will be the search for a way out.
As it is, the peace force comes in the
nick of time. The British forces, who
have thanklessly held the ring since the
troubles began in December, have in-
creasingly fallen foul of the Greek com-
munity—and thus of the Cyprus Govern-
ment. A month ago Archbishop Makarios
publicly went on record as wanting an
international force under British com-
mand. This is not politically possible
today.
This is not the fault of the British
troops; it is a measure of their success
in playing fair by both sides. They have
refused Greek demands that they should
assist the “lawful forces of the State”,
i.e., the Greeks, to keep order and have
insisted on their strict neutrality even
where that has meant appearing to favor
the Turkish demand for separation.
The new UN force is certain to come
under heavy pressure to reverse this
decision. It may benefit from a sense
of exhaustion with the fighting. When
the leader of the Turkish community, Dr
Kutchuk, visited Famagusta recently, his
speech, full of death and glory, con-
spicuously failed to rouse his audience
in the main square of the Turkish quarter.
Two bursts of handclapping was all the
response he got.
However difficult the task'of the force,
it will be nothing to that of the mediator.
The prospect for a settlement looks very
remote. The Zurich agreements, which
set up the independent State of Cyprus,
broke down because they forcibly yoked
together the Greek and Turkish com-
munities while at the same time stressing
their distinct separate positions. To have
worked this formula would have needed
more goodwill than either could muster.
The result is that one community—
the Turkish —now demands to be com-
pletely separate by means of partition.
The other the Greek demands the
opposite: the absorption of both com-
munities in a single unitary State. There
is not much room for compromise here.
But perhaps the parties are merely
bidding up their claims and will be ready
to back down in the course of bargain-
ing? If they are not, deadlock is cer-
tainly complete. Unfortunately, on the
Turkish side, it is the extremists who are
in control. It is the strong man behind
Dr Kutchuk, Mr Denktash, who is
making the running. (And now the
Turkish Government has issued “a last
warning” to Makarios.)
On the Greek side the Minister of the
Interior, Mr Georgadjis is having a
good deal of success in bringing the
armed bands of irregulars under the
umbrella of the State. He is not doing
this in order to disarm them but so as
to justify the Government in enforcing
its claim to rule a unitary State. After
all, majorities have their rights.
However justified the Greek case for
simple majority rule within a unitary
State may be, it would be too much to
expect the UN mediator to accept it just
like that.
To accept the Turkish demand for
partition, however, would be not just
unrealistic but inconceivable politically
and, even more, geographically. So many
people more Greeks than Turks
would have to move their homes to carve
out a zone for the 18 per cent Turkish
part of the population. No Greek would
wish to move and the Turks have never
produced evidence to show how many of
their community want to move.
Nonetheless the mediator should cer-
tainly probe the possibility of encoura-
ging as many Turks as are willing to move
to do so, for the concentration of the
Turkish population (with or without
separate government) would at least
lessen their fears of vengeance at the
hands of the Greeks. That done, he
should try to see what powers of govern-
ment could be decentralised locally in
“cantons” so that the island became a
sort of confederation.
Whether the Greeks will entertain
either or both these possibilities will pro-
bably depend on how things go in the
next three months. But whether they do
or not, there are two elements which must
subsist in any new settlement. There
must be safeguards for the Turkish
minority and there must be an umpire
to whom appeal can lie in the event of
those safeguards being breached.


Around Melbourne
TO MOOMBA OR NOT TO MOOMBA?
A Mr Ronald Kirk, of Kew, who
created the little figure used as
the symbol for Melbourne’s Moomba,
seems to have been prescient. What
looks like a cheerful little man at first
sight proves on closer inspection to
be wearing a dainty ballet skirt
between the boomerang that is his
arms and the boomerang that is his
legs. Such characters, I am told, are
likely in real life to suffer acute
internal tensions and to have dif-
ficulties in their relationships with the
outside world. This crazy mixed-up
feeling at the moment is about all we
have left of the Moomba spirit.
The finale of the 1964 Moomba
was a fireworks display in which 800
quids’ worth of aaah and oooh was
fired. Some local youth put on their
own display, a brawl-’n’-bash with
beer - can orchestra. The balletic
movement of screaming larrikins
through a 100-yard line of ladies
queuing at the 100 was in the best
traditions of Melbourne choreography.
This ding, however, is not why
organisers of our annual “get together
and have fun” are warning that in
1965 we may have to go to other
places and have fun in other ways.
The sad truth is that in the 10 years
of its would-be playful existence the
Moomba Festival has never managed
to convince enough people that it
should exist at all. It hasn’t con-
vinced Premier Henry Bolte, for one,
as the festival chairman, Mr T. A.
Pettigrew, has discovered.
Perhaps the events of the 10-day
carnival proved too abstract and
ephemeral for the Premier, who
believes that what is progressive in
Victoria is the concrete. Anyway,
Mr Bolte was not lured this year to
the Japanese Symphony Orchestra, to
the water ski-ing, to the brass bands,
to a street parade starring leda Vargas
(Miss Universe), who smiled at every-
one, to a hill-billy season, to the
Mardi Gras, where a petrol-driven
dodgem car exploded and beer was
on in booths to 6 p.m. or anything.
So Mr Bolte does not see why he
should increase the Government con-
tribution of £2OOO to a sum closer to
the £15,000 coughed in by the City
Council, or the seven or eight
thousand put up by business.
This led Mr Pettigrew to say
angrily that Mr Bolte was not a city
man. As Opposition leader Stoneham
has been saying in the country that
Henry is not a country man either,
this leaves the Premier somewhat in
the position of having no world, like
those Samuel Beckett characters who
have to live in dustbins.
Mr Bolte, however, is a sharp
fighter, sharper than Tom Pettigrew,
who came to Moomba from Myers
as the festival’s fifth chairman. Henry
declared that more people are
attracted to the Ballarat Begonia
Festival than to Moomba.
Ballarat, need we add, is in Henry’s
electorate. There are few occasions
that the Premier cannot turn wittily
to a political coup.
A N annual row over Moomba is a
steady event. The arguing began
even before the first Moomba set out,
years ago, its eyes filled with mist, as
it announced its ambition to out-
Edinburgh Edinburgh, to out-Nice
Nice, to out-Rio Rio, and to make
Melbourne a cultural centre, whatever
that is, of the world.
We had a shemozzle when the City
Development Association pulled out
in a huff. We got together and had
fun when there were so many beauty
queens at once that arrangements got
tangled at the Town Hall and no one
was sure who was paying allegiance
to whom or for what.
We still have a Moomba Queen,
but actually the only one to achieve
later fame has been Honi Freger
(1959), and that was because she got
into a mix-up three years later and
someone set fire to her flat and put
her in fear of her life and all that
sort of thing.
Astrologists and others can now
detect in the Melbourne year a dis-
tinct Moomba cycle. This begins with
the announcement that we will have
another one. Then comes the period
of planning. The word culture is
mentioned so often that, if we reached
for our guns, it would be like six
episodes of “Gunsmoke” all at once.
Next follows the period of construc-
tion, with models of bunyips, etc.,
while pretty girls appear in quests.
All newspapers then take up the cry
as Moomba itself draws near.
Then it’s over. The questioning
starts. Was it any good? Why don't
people get more excited? Why don't
they laugh and cheer and dance?
Come now, is it really necessary?
Should we have another eh, really?
Deep sociological questions are in-
volved in this, as to whether such a
well-fed, complacent, conformist and
inhibited society as ours can ever be
expected to Moomba properly. But
basically, no doubt, it’s a question of
money, and Mr Pettigrew is right.
As the American guitarist Eddie
Condon said in Melbourne this week
after playing with his band at that
Moomba - type Bacchanalia in
Adelaide: With enough publicity you
can promote cyanide.

LIFE IN THE NAVY
Sir,
The letters from officers of the Army
and the Air Force in your recent issues
are, I submit, inadequate contributions to
the airing of the problem of dissatis-
faction among officers of the Services.
Let there be no doubt about it, most of
us are in the Services because we like it,
and few of us have any real desire to
leave our chosen profession. One of your
contributors suggests that many of us
were brought into the Services under false
pretences, implying that we were not old
enough to know our own minds. Of
course, this is true. I joined the Royal
Australian Naval College at the age of
13 with all sorts of exotic ideas. What
is more to the point is that by the time I
was old enough I had no doubts about
my career, nor did my colleagues.
The time when loyalty is stretched
hardest comes later, when officers are
trying to match the needs of their families
with their personal happiness. No wife
can be expected to share her loyalty in-
definitely. It is absurd to expect her to
be happy moving from State to State,
hunting for a cheap flat until married
quarters “come up”, making yet another
lot of curtains, taking the children to yet
another new school. It takes on the
average about eight years for the tarnish
to wear off.
In the Navy about half of the officers
“make the grade” and serve until they
are 50 or 55. The rest are retired at 45,
unwanted and unqualified - except in
things purely naval. We in the Navy
really don't know if the gamble we are
taking with our families makes us loyal
or just plain wet.

INDONESIAN “WAR LORDS”
Sir,
So long as Prof. John Legge was dis-
posed to reply to Dr Knopfelmacher’s
strictures on his interpretation of the
Indonesian situation by way of cloudy
generalities, I was most unwilling to enter
this dispute. But now (Bulletin,
7/3/64) Prof. Legge has seen fit to
challenge a statement attributed to me.
“Name a single military commander,”
Prof. Legge says, “to whom the descrip-
tion (of ‘semi-independent war lords’)
could reasonably be applied today?”
I am delighted to oblige but, before
supplying not one but several names, I
should like to say that for me this
description relates to the power structure
and in no way necessarily means that I
disapprove of the man. For example,
the admirable Ardjie at Bandung appears
to experienced observers to fit this
description, though they believe him to
be an excellent and fair-minded admini-
strator. Suharjo in East Kalimantan
similarly fits this description but his
behavior, especially towards Western
technicians, has been extremely arbitrary.
A third military governor who would
fit the description is Yusuf in South
Sulawesi.
Prof. Legge seems to be implying that
military command is equivalent to that
obtaining in, say, Australia. This implica-
tion is grotesquely misleading. Apropos
of “war lords”, the description would
seem to fit the Head of State himself
with delightful accuracy in point of be-
havior and surrounding entourage; there
aren't many States which can boast of
having as constitutional No. 4 a man
who has retired from banditry to become
predator-in-chief of the capital city.
Pace Prof. Legge, “a determination to
keep open the door to negotiation and
understanding” is not a policy at all;
which is one very important reason why
we are today in this dangerous predica-
ment. In modern terms, Indonesia is
at present waging war against Malaysia,
politically, psychologically, and by tested
guerrilla methods. It is doing this because
of the half-demented ambitions of its
“Warlord-in-Chief” and because its Java-
centric administration is so inefficient
that Djakarta fears a prosperous and
united Malaysia would attract, by its
example, those non-Javanese constituent
units, particularly Sumatra, which have
caused so much trouble in the past. The

DEFENCE
Sir,
The articles you have recently published
on war policy point, I suggest, towards
three conclusions they do not explicitly
state:
1. The Cabinet and the Minister of
Defence need a general staff service
capable of thinking in terms of grand
strategy—of war as a political and
economic operation as well as a military
one.
2. Grave discrepancies exist between
our foreign and war policy when, in fact,
the two ought to be complementary parts
of one policy—of what might be called
our survival policy.
3. Our public attitude towards our
survival policy would more befit a blessed
backwater of a nation, quarantined from
history by some prepotent force such as
the Royal Navy used to be.
The provision of a general staff service,
transcending the general staffs of the
armed forces, is primarily an educational
problem. We need a higher school of
war which will take the brightest officers
of the Services at an early age say
25 to 30 and put them through an
appropriate course of several years’
duration. There is no other way to
provide the Cabinet and the Minister
with a body of advisers and executives
which can help them to make war policy
and carry it into effect. Secondarily it is
a problem of preventing the jealous
civilians of the Public Service from
denying the general staff immediate access
to its political chiefs and a necessary
modicum of executive function. The
public servants of the Department of
Defence should have a purely ancillary
role.
Since the fall of Singapore in 1942,
Australia has been a European outpost,
far beyond the shrivelling periphery of
Europe's power and influence. Since the
Indonesian take-over of western New
Guinea, she has been in the technical
sense a “marcher” State having a land
frontier with an alien civilisation. Out-
posts are always expendable, especially
weak ones. As an outpost and a marcher
State we need a system of national ser-
vice as closely integrated into the
nation's social fabric as Switzerland's
and as capable of keeping up the strength
of the “force-in-being” as the United
States’.

THE EICHMANN TRIAL
Sir,
In his review of Hannah Arendt’s
“Eichmann in Jerusalem” (7/3/64) Dr
Knopfelmacher’s exposures of the fuzzy
mediocrity of what currently passes for
liberalism, especially that affected by
academics, are a major contribution to
intellectual discussion in Australia. But
Dr Knopfelmacher does not quite make
his attitude clear on two basic lesions in
Miss Arendt’s book, although he refers
to them in a way that certainly suggests
he would not agree they are flaws
at all, let alone serious ones —her
acceptance of the kidnapping of Eich-
mann as a civilised way of justifying the
law and her complementary, but yet quite
extraordinary, arrogance in finding Eich-
mann guilty in her own terms and sen-
tencing him to execution.
Dr Knopfelmacher lowers his stan-
dards, and embraces the “liberals” when
he speaks of objections to the procedures
surrounding the Eichmann affair as
“legalistic squabbles”. Indeed, these pro-
cedures were of a piece with the in-
human practices of the Nazi thugs and
“judicial” officers, and make a mockery
of Miss Arendt’s theme of the banality
of evil; Israel, in assuming gratuitously
the terrible right to act on behalf of man-
kind, has made of Eichmann anything
but “an ordinary chap”.
Often, to preserve the law, a guilty
man has to go free, exposed and bearing
his shame and guilt. Hard as it may
seem, this is what should have happened
to Eichmann. Humanity has suffered yet
more blows in his kidnapping, “trial”,
and execution.

WOOL AT PORTLAND
Sir,
The article “Bolte and the Wool-men”
(22/2/64) gave a fair presentation of
Portland as a wool-selling centre except
for one aspect. Any reader would have
been left with the impression that prices
obtained at Portland were markedly
below those obtained at other centres.
Comparisons of the kind made in the
article are relatively meaningless unless
you can point to wool that has come
from one property and classed into one
lot, half of which has gone to Portland
and half of which to another centre.
Even then, to be valid, the split lot would
have to be sold probably within the same
week. Such comparisons, for obvious
reasons, are very difficult to make, but
on the day of the first Portland sale I
met one very happy customer who had
split a lot of ten bales—five bales had
been sold at the previous Geelong sale


SELECTIVE VIEWING AND LISTENING
A new heart for Graham In homes across the nation, a
human heart lay bare to the surgeon’s scalpel. To a background of operating theatre sounds,
and the words of the surgeon, ABC viewers shared the drama and inspiration of the life-
giving operation that mended the hole in a child’s heart. This was the 60-minute docu-
mentary—“A new heart for Graham”—produced in Australia by the ABC as a contribution
to mature, thoughtful TV viewing. To the hundreds of thousands who watched it,
meant a unique opportunity to observe and evaluate the miracle of modern surgery through
the intimate eye of the TV camera.
Such commentary on the world around us is typical of the selective programming offered on
ABC television and radio. It is not necessarily material with mass appeal. But it is
of absorbing and vital interest to those who must choose their programs with care. Your
taste could run to music or drama. Or controversial panel discussion. Whatever it is, the
ABC caters for the selective viewer and listener. Check the daily programs carefully . . .

you will find new values, new pleasures
when you tune ABC.

and five bales at Portland. The Portland
wool brought the higher price. However,
this was two or three weeks after the
Geelong sale and prices, I admit, had
risen.
The best comparison of prices between
centres is provided by the Australian
Wool Board’s statistical service. This
service provides each week for compari-
son of prices at different centres worked
out on a clean basis. A difference of
Id. or of 2d. on so much per lb. clean
would be greatly reduced if greasy com-
parisons were available.
At the last Portland sale, which was
held in the week ending February 7, 64’s
good made 144 d. at Portland and 145 d.
at Sydney, 58’s good made 126 d. at
Portland and 127 d. at Geelong, 58’s
average made 124 d. at Portland and
125 d. at Sydney and Geelong. In each of
these examples I have quoted there has
been one penny , difference on a clean
basis. If this were quoted on a greasy
basis the difference would, of course, be
much less than the penny. It will clearly
be seen that the very great differentials
quoted in The Bulletin article do not
give a fair or just comparison of the
margins between Portland-sold wool and
that sold at other centres.

NEED FOR OPTOMETRIST?
Sir,
I feel that I should attract your atten-
tion to the apparent lack of Federal
political knowledge of your Launceston
correspondent (29/2/64). When describ-
ing an advertisement by the Country
Party he referred to it in this manner:
“The candidates have been introduced
in big newspaper advertisements. ‘Here
are my teams’, 1962 world champion
Graham Hill says, beaming down from
the top corner of the page across the
ranks of candidates’ ‘pictures’.”
The only remark I make is—if your
political correspondent in Launceston
sees any likeness between Graham Hill
and John McEwen, he certainly needs
a visit to an optometrist.

THE GULF COUNTRY
Sir,
We are spending £4OO million on the
Snowy River scheme and, although it is
a good one, land settlement in the Gulf
country would pay eventually a much
higher dividend. We have what might
be called a pilot scheme here on the
Upper Burnett, where 2000 men were
settled on small areas in 1924. I was
one of them. That was in the horse-
plough days. Today, machine methods
require machine finance.
Western Cape York and the Northern
Gulf country, good land with good rain-
fall, offer the best opportunity in the
world today to a worker to become
independent. There is room there for
100,000 settlers on small holdings. We
only need some good all-weather roads
and a good method of settler finance.
We have in Queensland two million
acres of brigalow scrub, trees with no
tap root, growing only on top of clay,
very often with coal underneath; the
biggest and best coalfield in Australia is
around these parts. The Government is
knocking down the brigalow around
Rockhampton and giving it out in
10,000-acre blocks. The whole 2,000,000
acres at this rate will only settle 250
men, and they cannot handle this area,
except to graze a few cattle. Bureaucrats
have the knack of doing always the
wrong thing, like British Army generals.

WORKING MOTHERS
Sir,
As a mother capable of earning £.BOO
per year, I feel compelled to express
dismay at suggestions by your Melbourne
correspondent (15/2/64) that Victoria
take “a lesson from the Soviet Union”
and establish nurseries at places of work.
Such nurseries are the expression of
Communist denial of parents’ rights and
duties regarding children; they are much
more than an idiosyncrasy of the Com-
munist State.
What is happening to the ideal of
family life when a leading magazine’s
article suggests we adopt the Communist
characteristic of withdrawing a woman
from her family and home, and handing
children over to the employer’s custody?
If farming-out children for Communism
is wrong, it is wrong to do so for the
sake of getting a TV set, vacuum cleaner,
or such. Surely a child has more right
to full and proper care by its mother
than a parent has to any luxury item.
Demands on the modern father are
usually heavy enough for him to have to
make a conscious effort to spend time
with his family, without a mother run-
ning away from her infants.
Finally, I would like to ask how Vic-
toria or any State can provide work for
“tens of thousands of working mothers”
while so many people (including bread-
winners) are unemployed.

Sir,
In your excellent article on Bob Santa-

errors and include among them the
“secrecy” of the Movement. That error
was never Santamaria’s. He opposed
secrecy at all times. He recorded his
vote against it. Some of those who later
accused him of “sinister secrecy” were
among those who had voted against him
when he tried to have the Movement
run without it.

Sir,
What would be the state of Austra-

the fight against Communism in Austra-

doors and almost plead with fellow Aus-
tralians not to throw away their free-
dom by voting for Reds and those who
help them? It is safe to say that with
no organised opposition, complete vic-
tory in the trade unions would be en-
joyed by the Reds long before this.

ROBERT MITCHELL
Sir,
May I draw your attention to an error
in M. H. Ellis’s review of Mr McPheat’s
book on John Flynn (22/2/64). Mr
Ellis writes: “He (Flynn) was not the first
in the field. Young Frank Rolland had
been the pioneer and the great and great-
hearted Mitchell had followed.”
The facts are that the Smith of Dunesk
mission, which is now the AIM, was
solely the brainchild of Robert Mitchell
and the appointment of Mr Mitchell as
the first missioner was made by the 1894
Presbyterian Assembly. Mr Mitchell
worked and developed the mission until
1899, when he became the minister of
the church in Goodwood which still bears
his name. The Rev. Frank Rolland was
inducted on August 15, 1905.
John Flynn’s contribution, and it was
a great one, was the “mantle of safety”
in which his vision of a Flying Doctor
service for the outback was translated
into reality. Nevertheless, none of this
would have been possible but for the
pioneering work of Robert Mitchell.

EMOTIONAL OUTLETS?
Sir,
I should like to point out to members
of the League of National Welfare and
Decency that independent studies in Aus-
tralia and Britain have been consistent
in their findings that, in both literature
and cinema, sex and violence do not
cause any imbalance in the child or in
the adolescent. “TV and the Australian
Adolescent”, by Campbell and Keogh,
and “TV and the Child”, by Himmel-
weit, have proved beyond doubt that the
child’s interest is an effect of something
in his personality make-up. They proved,
and related the same proof to literature,
that films provide an outlet for the child.
If this were not available he would find
some other expression, perhaps less
socially acceptable. To repress this
need for an emotional outlet is to create
an unhealthy climate of shame, guilt,
repression and mental and physical
frustration.

OUT AND ABOUT
Adelaide The Third Time Up
Or is the Festival too much of a good thing?
By PATRICIA ROLFE
At the last moment there was a
hitch. What should one wear for
“Henry the Fifth” in a tent
theatre? White tie? Black? Or some-
thing else? What else is worn in
Adelaide? Adelaide debated the ques-
tion. Old men in the Adelaide Club
were woken up and asked an opinion
out of the richness of their experience.
The producer of “Henry the Fifth”, Mr
Tom Brown, finally said he would wear
a black tie but that people could come
in anything they pleased as long as they
came. (As it happened the best choice
would have been parka, fur coat and
snow boots.) But a stand had been
taken and Adelaide, that perfect, pro-
vincial city with its perfectly provincial
people, was ready for its third Festival
of the Arts.
But this is hardly fair. The Adelaide
Establishment and Adelaide snobbery
are as stale an institutional joke as Chloe
in Young and Jackson’s. Adelaide is not
the only city in the world where people
choose their theatre entertainment by
the official guest-list rather than by the
cast, or where your view of paintings is
obscured by atrocious millinery. But
Adelaide manages to keep its statistical
average high and you can treasure the
exchange between two women in full
evening dress at the opening of “Night
on Bald Mountain”: “Have you ever
read anything of Patrick White’s?” “No.
What has he written?”
But an enormous, almost incalculable,
amount of devoted and detailed work
went into the making of the Festival.
This came from everybody from the
artistic director, Professor John Bishop,
and his staff, down to the last woman
pressing pompom dahlias into a floral
carpet. All this good-mannered effort
seems directed at giving you pleasure.
If these people can rise above the over-
whelming, overdressed Adeladies, the
rest of us should be able to, too. There
just remains the fleeting thought —is
the Festival too good for Adelaide?
There is also the thought: Is the
Festival too much of a good thing? The
Festival’s publicity officer, Mr George
Farwell, said that this time there were
165 performances, involving 2500 artists,
1400 of these of serious intent. The
others appeared at Festival Fair, the
popular entertainment in Elder Park.
Mr Farwell said about 7000 people
were involved in Festival performances
when stage-crews and others were
counted. Eighty thousand tickets were
available for public performances. There
were 20 art exhibitions and the estimated
figure of 100,000 visitors to galleries
could easily be conservative.
There is such a lot to see and do that
it induces that manic state that is
supposed to overtake shoppers in duty-
free ports. These wake up in the middle
of the night and want to rush out and
do some more shopping. So in Adelaide
you wake up in the morning and are
caught momentarily with the thought
that you must rush off at 9.15 a.m. to
a UNESCO seminar on music for films.
Audiences must inevitably make
choices, but for artists it is more dif-
ficult. It is a Festival of the Arts, but
there is almost no interchange between
artists, musicians, actors and writers.
You must except Mr. Sidney Nolan, a
one-man festival, with the exhibition of
his African paintings at the Bonython
Gallery, set designs for the ballet, “The
Display”, for which Robert Helpmann
has done the choreography, and an
entree to Writers’ Week on the strength
of dust jackets for Alan Moorehead and
George Johnston.
Tf the Festival is basically purposeful,
aimed at bringing the arts to the mass-
es, painting led the way. The art exhibi-
tions may have been the most exhilarat-
ing segment of the Festival. At many
times of the day there were queues out-
side the National Gallery, which had
nine exhibitions. These included six
Royal portraits lent by the Queen, the
James Michener collection of modern
American art, and Gothic art from the
London Victoria and Albert Museum.
Although nine exhibitions for 2s. was
the best value in Adelaide there were
also always large crowds at the Russell
Drysdale exhibition in the gallery of
John Martin’s shop across the street
from the National Gallery. While the
crowds at the Bonython Gallery for
the Nolan exhibition were indistinguish-
able from fashionable art crowds any-
where, at the Drysdale there were prams
and pushers.
Through all accusations that music
dominates the Festival, Professor Bishop,
who is head of the Elder Conserva-
torium, has remained smiling. But this
time orchestral performances did not
begin until the third day of the Festival.
In nearly everything Adelaide had to
rely on outside help. This came mainly
from the ABC and the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust. The Musica Viva's
contribution was notably the Deller
Consort which gave recitals and also
appeared in the local production of
‘‘The Play of Daniel”.
Juggernauts, such as the Elizabethan
and the ABC, seem the best way of
distributing artistic endeavor across a
large country with a small, scattered
population, and they certainly moved in
to reinforce the Festival's efforts. We
are all very used to the ABC, and its
marvellous efficiency is taken for
granted in a way that the Commission
might accept as a sort of compliment.
Flowever, stage presentations offer
more varied problems even than trans-
porting a whole orchestra from Sydney.
The Elizabethan Theatre Trust still
often has to stand up to a good deal of
criticism, but at the Adelaide Festival,
the Trust really “came good”. It might
be unfair to say that the effectiveness of
its contribution should be credited to
its relatively new director, Mr Stefan
Haag. The answer might be that the
Trust has now been going long enough
for some of the unsuitable people to be
eliminated and some of the mistakes to
have been made. But on the other hand,
it might be equally unfair not to give Mr
Haag some of the credit.
The trust staged two operas ,“Troilus
and Cressida”, and “Macbeth”, during
the Festival, and “Carmen” right at the
tail end of the fortnight. It also pre-
sented the Australian Ballet in two new
ballets, “The Display” and “Jazz Spec-
trum”. It also handled the visiting Black
Theatre of Prague. The Adelaide Festival
met some of the cost of “Henry the
Fifth”, “Troilus and Cressida” and
“Macbeth”.
What the cost might have been might
be guessed from the fact that “Troilus’*
alone meant 111 costumes and three
sets. “Henry the Fifth” meant, not only
a tent which cost £40,000, but an . Eliza-
bethan-type stage weighing eight tons,
which was made in Sydney and trans-
ported to Adelaide. Eighty-three cos-
tumes and 30 sets of armor were made
in Sydney for “Henry”. The cast of 45

rehearsed for a month in Sydney before
going to Adelaide.
“Troilus” had two imported principals,
Marie Collier, returned home from Lon-
don for the occasion, and English tenor,
Richard Fewis.
The Trust has tried to make Adelaide
a sort of fanfare for its year’s activities.
Forty members of the opera company
now have annual contracts. This is the
first time the Trust has managed this.
The 34 dancers in the Australian Bal-
let are also under annual contract. After
Adelaide they will go to Sydney and
Melbourne for the Fonteyn-Nureyev
season, but a whole year’s activity is
planned for the company.
However, the tent theatre, in which
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust is one of
five shareholders, is not an unqualified
success. Our ancestors moved out of
caves because these were cold and
draughty. For the same reasons they
later moved out of tents into bricks and
mortar. In Adelaide, in early autumn,
audiences nearly froze. You could also
take it a certain that, say, in the inland
areas of Queensland in summer if
the tent, which has a permanent crew
of 12, is really an economic proposi-
tion for country tours —audiences would
nearly suffocate. At any rate the tent
will be useless for six months of the
year. Then there is rain. If Sydney has
a wet Easter and when didn’t Sydney
have a wet Easter? the tent will be
awash in Rushcutters Bay park.
Tf a physically cold audience were not
A enough disadvantage for actors to
face, there was the added fact that the
seats are uncomfortable. Even the Trust
people admit that the tiers of seating
should begin from the edge of the apron
and not from about 12 rows back. The
tent is supposed to give audiences a
feeling of participating in the action.
However, from the front rows, you get
only an occasional glimpse of the actors’
faces behind the feet, legs and buttocks
of Henry’s brave Englishmen storming
the walls of Harfleur. No audience wants
to participate in quite this way.
Audience participation seemed to be
achieved much more cheaply and much
less effortlessly at Writers’ Week. If
writers’ get-togethers never make a
writer write a better book, they may
achieve what is no less important. They
may make readers read with more enjoy-
ment. On this basis the Writers’ Week
at the Festival must have achieved some-
thing. It would be hard to believe other-
wise, after watching perhaps 500 people,
including about 100 little convent-school
girls in the madly chic hats that Adelaide
school girls wear, sitting in the sun on
the University lawns, listening to David
Campbell, Nancy Keesing, Rosemary
Dobson and Geoffrey Hutton reading
some of their poems.
If he had been less charming and
sensible, the choice of Alan Moorehead
to open Writers’ Week might have come
close to embarrassing. As Mr Moorehead
would know, there is no ratio between
effort and return, and although one must
agree with him that conditions for
writers in this country have improved,
high reputation still too often goes with
low income.
Mr Moorehead, not entirely unexpect-
edly, began by saying that he didn’t
believe in writers’ conferences. Writing
was a lonely job. A writer should avoid
publishers’ cocktail parties, TV appear-
ances and meeting other writers.
However, Mr Moorehead admitted, as
he grew older he began to see that there
might be value in writers meeting, par-
ticularly in a country like Australia.
If he did not have family, friends_and
home in Europe, he would come back
to Australia to live “like a shot”. As
it was, he hoped to work out some way
of commuting. (Just as Catholics say
there should be a separate church for
converts, so we might eventually have
to establish a separate state for- repatria-
ting expatriates).
But the Adelaide Festival is not all
poetry on sunlit lawns and dedicated
performance. The Festival is assuming
a character, but it needs careful tending
if it is not all going to slide off into
“fringe” activities and semi-amateur per-
formances. The fringe is now as thick
as a Beatle’s. This is a sign of vigor, but
it is also something which can swamp the
main endeavor.
By 1966, the next Festival year, it is
expected that Elizabeth, 30 miles from
Adelaide, will have a new theatre for
stage presentation. Enthusiasts will be
expected to go as far afield as this for
the Festival, but there is no likelihood
of Adelaide itself having more than one,
full-sized professional theatre. This lack,
which means alternating opera and ballet
at Her Majesty’s and compromises such
as tents, seems to threaten the Festival.
A nother lack is good criticism. Actors,
singers and producers get the
feeling that they are performing
in a void. They have to wait one
or two days for the Sydney and
Melbourne papers to find out if they
were any good. If writers, singers and
actors can be imported for the Festival,
it might break new ground to bring a
critic, in any field, of world standing to
Adelaide in 1966.
But 1964 was the third Festival, and
the third time should prove it. Recently
Adelaide’s Festival was threatened by a
takeover bid from Sydney. This can
hardly be taken seriously. One can be
perfectly certain that you couldn’t impose
a Festival of the Arts on the cheerful
vulgarity of the Waratah Festival.
Adelaide is entitled to its festival, not
particularly because the city is the
“ideal size” (Paris and Athens have
festivals) but because it thought of it
first. Fair’s fair.
Both Adelaide’s leading guests of
honor, Sir William Walton and Mr Alan
Moorehead, said they did not like festi-
vals. They may not like festivals, and on
their level of eminence they may not need
them. But they do need the sort of
people who go to festivals and the sort
of people who make them.


REVIEWS
ART
A Brilliant Adelaide Festival
Arthur Boyd , Nolan and Drysdale at their peak
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
nPHE 1964 Adelaide Festival of Arts,
after some doleful prognostications,
has turned out to be the greatest success
of aff the three Festivals held so far. The
art exhibitions in particular have
achieved that balance of local and im-
ported, familiar and strange, miniature
and heroic, which alone provides that
basis of critical comparison which makes
a festival contribute something more
than entertainment to the community.
The music and drama of the Festival
justify Max Harris’s remarks in the West
Australian “Critic” (heavily and selec-
tively misreported in South Australia)
that the Festival runs the danger of be-
coming an exercise in cultural snobbery.
Fine things have been brought to Adel-
aide in both these fields, but no Aus-
tralian music or drama has officially
been allowed to compete, and the gene-
ral effect is of other times, other
glories, other countries.
But in art the field is broad and fair,
and the high hills in it are Australian
as well as American and European.
There are large retrospective exhibitions
devoted to Russell Drysdale and Arthur
Boyd, and Kym Bonython is showing a
solid selection of Sidney Nolan’s African
paintings. At the SA School of Arts
Gallery an excellent local painter, the
late Horace Trenery, is given the benefit
of a large exhibition. Then at the National
Gallery, as well as the Boyd, there is
a selection from the Michener Collec-
tion of Contemporary American Paint-
ing; the Peter Stuyvesant Collection of
Contemporary Art from a large number
of countries; a very impressive selection
of Contemporary American Prints;
Eskimo carvings; a superb gathering of
Gothic art; an often unintentionally hil-
arious bunch of “Famous Australians by
Famous Australian Artists” (Longstaff’s
twittering Nellie Melba is a peach); a
selection from the undistinguished Archi-
bald, Wynn and Sulman Prizes; and a
pretty decrepit sextet of pompous por-
traits lent by HM The Queen. There
is a large ceramic exhibition from Aus-
tralian and New Zealand potters at the
RSA Society of Arts, which illustrates
the basic problem of utility versus
aesthetics associated with the medium.
Then there are smaller exhibitions, not-
ably that at Ailsa Osborne’s Gallery
which has a catholic if predominantly
figurative selection of contemporary art
with some particularly good work by
Ray Cooke and Donald Friend.
This is by no means all. It is only
by enumerating the various exhibitions
to be seen that the Festival atmosphere
can be conveyed. (At least, one element
of it, as really the most invigorating if
subsequently debilitating element in the
Festival atmosphere is the talking and
drinking, miraculous revivals being ef-
fected every morning, while old feuds
are healed and new friendships formed.)
It is all very well to say that one can
sit and wait in Sydney or Melbourne
and most things at the Adelaide Festival
will arrive in good time. This may be
so, but the cumulative and comparative
effect will be lost, as also will all the
people who have come together for a
special occasion.
rjIHE Arthur Boyd show, beautifully hung
in three large courts of the National
Gallery, establishes his stature as never
before in Australia. Boyd has had plenty
of admirers (and not a few detractors),
but his range, imagination and technical
brilliance are reaching a vast audience
with this collection. Those not fortunate
enough to have seen Drysdale’s retro-
spective exhibition in Sydney in 1961
will be able to catch up (on a smaller
scale but no less representative) at the
show at John Martin’s. It is disgraceful
that we still have to wait for a big
retrospective show of Nolan in Australia.
Boyd’s progression from the land-
scapes painted when he was in his late
teens, where the paint is thick as driven
sheep but the total effect is of air and
peace, to the twisted forests haunted by
hunted humans, to the marvellous
warmth and clarity of the Wimmera
tempera landscapes has illuminated as
much of the face of Australia as has
the work of any other of our painters.
Not content to stop here, he has dug
deep into the human condition, joyful
in love or disbelievingly cursed by guilt.
From the muted colors of his youth he
has attempted the widest tonal contrasts,
to retire in recent paintings to closer
variations, in some cases with a distinct
falling off in the value of his color. His
most recent work, in ceramics, has been
a good deal subtler and more tautly
handled than his painting. One feels
that he is ripe for a change, although
in his early forties he has already made
himself a life’s monument.
Drysdale’s retrospective show at John
Martin’s once again confirms his place
in our national history. Here is a great
painter who has weathered some ex-
tremely difficult years and is now with-
out doubt ready to go even further.
Sufficient evidence is here, from the
exquisite Matisse- and Picasso - like
works of his student days to that early-
found and never-lost individuality which
has been consolidated with maturity. At
this exhibition the paintings are particu-
larly well reinforced by drawings, at
which Drysdale excels.
The Nolan African paintings are
exciting and sometimes startling in ways
unexpected from Nolan. Great bands of
brilliant color vibrate around the drama
of the animals so that the total effect
has something of the razzle-dazzle of
the circus, as if Nolan were a delighted
and astonished spectator at the greatest
show on earth, which is surely that of
the Almighty in Africa and not that
of an American showman. But, except
for a few gill-like heads, or an elephant
dominated by sheer dignity, Nolan is
refreshing himself with new imagery
rather than recreating imagery funda-
mental to his own deepest experience.
Drysdale and Nolan have gone their
own way; influences do not matter. Boyd,
in another perfectly legitimate tradition,
has drawn from and reshaped in his
own image the work of several great
masters. In the abstractions at the Mich-
ener and Stuyvesant shows the dominant
mode is all powerful: the regional is
abjured influences come by jet. However,
the original article does not come often
to Australia; we are familiar with many
of these artists in reproduction, but it is
splendid to see Jackson Pollock (a little
piano), Kline, Lacasse and such like on
the wall. In a touching little programme
note, the American director of the
Michener collection explains that aero-
planes do not have freight hatches large
enough to accommodate America’s best
paintings.
There is, unfortunately, no large col-
lection of Australian abstract work at the
Festival, though a solitary Brett Whitely
holds its own comfortably in the Stuy-
vesant collection. But the basis of com-
parison is there. If Drysdale seems a
little old-fashioned, so, one is told, was
Renoir in 1910.

MUSIC
Festive Sounds
rpHE Adelaide Festival organisers settled
for a predominantly musical festival
in 1964, and drew a good deal of criti-
cism from the champions of legitimate
drama on that account. There are various
reasons for this musical emphasis, not
the least of them being the fact that
some of the nervous burghers of Adel-
aide fear the controversial potentialities
of the spoken word.
But it is also true that music has very
practical charms for the long-range
organisers of a festival. It comes mainly
in prepared packages, pretested and
guaranteed, labelled “Deller Consort’’ or
“Sydney Symphony Orchestra”. Even a
musical score, though subject to some
uncertainties in its interpretation, is a
far more specific commodity than a
written play which has to be cast, design-
ed and produced and depends in its
ultimate effect on a multitude of chancy
factors.
But in its initial stages the Festival
has provided relatively little standard
concert activity. The main musical
events of the first few days were theatri-
cal: two opera premieres and the open-
ing performance of something that is very
like an opera, though it anticipated the
official invention of that form by about
400 years the medieval music drama,
“The Play of Daniel”.
The visiting Deller Consort formed
the nucleus of “Daniel” but did not
give its first formal recital until the fifth
day of the Festival; the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra, which is later to give
a concert of works by William Walton
under the composer's direction and take
part in the first Australian performance
of Britten’s “War Requiem”, has yet to
make its debut at the time of writing.
Opera is the most glamorous and
colorful of the branches of music and
therefore tempting material for the
launching of a festival. But it does lack
that certainty of effect mentioned above;
it shares the chanciness of straight
drama. The first of the operas contribut-
ed to the Adelaide Festival by the Eli-
zabethan Trust Opera, Walton’s “Troilus
and Cressida”, was a glowing succes;
the second, Verdi's “Macbeth”, was a
curate’s egg, though there was enough
dramatic force in John Shaw's interpre-
tation of the title role to earn it as
enthusiastic a reception as an Adelaide
audience is likely to give to any un-
familiar work.
For anyone unacquainted with Wal-
ton’s music the relatively “popular” (and
often second-hand) idiom of “Troilus”
will be a strange preparation for the dis-
sonant and tumultuous First Symphony

—a work that is about 20 years older—-
which is to be played later in the Festi-
val, or even for the cheerful satire of
the 40-year-old “Facade” (another Fes-
tival offering).
The forward impulse of Walton’s cre-
ative spirit seemed to depart somewhere
around the end of the 19405; everything
that has come since has consisted mainly
of memories of old Walton. “Troilus” is
quite frankly an opera written for the
audience, and here the borrowings from
old Walton are joined with recollections
of Richard Strauss and Puccini. But
forgetting all this, it cannot be denied
that the opera does what it sets out to
do effectively enough at least when it
is driven forward by an alert conductor,
a resourceful producer and a good cast.
The Adelaide production has all these, in
conductor Joseph Post, producer Robin
Lovejoy, and a remarkably consistent
cast led by Marie Collier and Richard
Lewis.
If there are any novice operagoers
unacquainted with the music of Verdi,
“Macbeth” would be just as deceptive
an introduction as “Troilus” is for Wal-
ton. It was written years before any
of the Verdi operas now on the regular
repertoire, and although Verdi’s melodic
vitality and dramatic sense are unmistak-
able the work is still very much part of
the rather trivial Italian operatic tra-
dition that Verdi himself was to trans-
form.
If it is to seem anything more than
a period piece to modern audiences it
must have singers of thrilling quality, and
the only one to fulfil this requirement in
the Adelaide production was John Shaw;
Tais Taras, the Lady Macbeth, fell well
below the requirements of what is in
fact the most important role in the
opera.
“The Play of Daniel”, produced in
the ornate Bonython Hall by Colin Bal-
lantyne, was a disappointment to those
who had seen the Sydney production of
the same work by James Lang, though
the Gothic freshness of the conception
seemed to come through to those who
were seeing and hearing it for the first
time.
It was too theatrical, too realistic and
too elaborate in its devices; it missed the
simple, stylised directness of the Sydney
production. The presence of the mem-
bers of the Deller Consort (who prefaced
the performance with some wonderfully
disciplined and stylish singing of medi-
eval part songs) was not a crucial ad-
vantage to the performance, since in this
simple, monophonic music the technical
skill of the singers is not of great
importance.

atmosphere which is refreshingly differ-

Of all Shakespeare’s plays, “Henry
V” is the one that most needs an Eliza-
bethan playhouse, because the Chorus
makes scenery redundant. In the Tent
Theatre, with its open stage, Tom
Brown has endeavored to give us a
production such as an Elizabethan audi-
ence would have seen. On the project-
ing stage, without scenery, all attention
is focused upon the actors. Their promi-
nence is further emphasised by the
splendor of their costumes. These,
beautifully designed by Desmond Digby,
also serve to distinguish the opposing
sides: browns and gold for the constant
English, colors of the earth and sun;
different shades of blue for the flighty
French, colors of the sea and sky.
Tom Brown’s production is workman-
like, honest and solid. There is nothing
flimsy or meretricious about it, nothing
skimped or makeshift. A strong support-
ing cast which gave some very sound
performances helped to create the im-
pression of solidity: Stewart Ginn’s
relaxed yet lively Chorus, John Llewel-
lyn's contentious but soldierly Fluellen,
Gordon Glenwright’s puffed-up balloon
of a Pistol, Owen Weingott’s watchful
Exeter and Alexander Hay’s tough,
leathery Constable of France. Anna
Volska is altogether delightful as Kather-
ine, excellently supported by Doreen
Warburton as Alice.
But, in spite of many excellent scenes
which remain vividly in the memory,
the production as a whole does not catch
fire. Although he gives a very accom-
plished performance, John Bell as Henry
V fails to set it alight. He has obviously
been strongly influenced by Olivier’s
playing of the role in the film. Mr
Bell's facial resemblance to the younger
Olivier makes the influence even more
noticeable. But, although John Bell re-
produces many of Olivier’s mannerisms,
smiles and gestures, he does not repro-
duce the character that Olivier created.
Olivier’s Henry, although flamboyant,
essentially a man of action, was also a
subtle man. Olivier's performance was
marked by the variety of moods he gave
to Henry, but whatever the mood he was
always the strongest and most colorful
character in any scene. With a voice of
extraordinary range and power, he put
an individual stamp on every word he
spoke.
John Bell’s Henry V is a much quieter
performance. He is princely, but not
quite kingly. He has not Olivier’s range
of mood or voice. But neither does he
appear to have Olivier’s conception of
the character. His Henry is colder, more
constricted and more pious. It is true
that Henry is depicted as pious, but

his God is a God of battles. Of course,
it is difficult for the modern temper to
accept that a war of aggression against a
neighboring country should be not only
patriotically but divinely sanctioned. But
this is a lusty, martial play which needs
to be approached robustly and played
with gusto. The whole production should
cry “God for Harry, England and Saint
George!”.

Genet. Union Theatre. Sydney.
T last saw Jack Benny during the
A Pacific war, on some island or other,
out front of one of those enormous
15,000-soldier audiences in the tropic
outdoors. He only had his violin and
Rochester along; he seemed to do abso-
lutely nothing—and yet, for what mem-
ory says, was a stretch of two hours,
he took that enormous, demanding mob
and did exactly what he wished with it.
Benny of twenty years ago had his
nervous moments, the times he had to
help his gags along a little, the occasional
moue straight from good old vaudeville.
Not any more, though.
Mr Benny gives you a quite unfor-
gettable night, and he is surprisingly well
supported by Lorrae Desmond and
Johnny O'Keefe, to whom I must admit
my heart went out. He came out to face
an audience of middle-class dowagers and
their escorts; belted out his usual wild
numbers and by the third item had
this notably frosty group actually joining
in the fun, clapping out those naughty
rhythms, rocking in intimate time with
Mr O’K's active hips. That, ladies and
gentlemen, takes real talent.
The new entertainment out at the
Music Hall you should enjoy much as
usual. Since my last visit there the food
and atmosphere has improved and the
expertise of the stage company has cer-
tainly not regressed. But I cannot recom-
mend the Genet plays produced by Syd-
ney University Dramatic Society at the
Union Theatre. These are two salon-
length dramas, dealing with a ferocious
sub-surface life alien to our comfortable
environment, and therefore demanding
exceptional richness of experience, tech-
nical range, and acting bravura from
the company essaying them.
None of these qualities was forthcom-
ing, and the whole evening was miser-
able.

Fractious Beast
The Playboy of the Western World,
J. M. Synge. Melbourne University
Dramatic Club. Union Theatre,
Melbourne.
The Naked Island. Russell Braddon.
Independent Players. St. Martin’s
Theatre. Melbourne.
Tt is a long way from Melbourne to
either Changi or the west coast of
Ireland, and neither of these productions
makes the distance. In the case of “The
Playboy of the Western World”, the
beautiful but fractious beast of a play,
capable of the journey if anything is,
proves too difficult for its handlers, and
simply sits down before our eyes. The
case of “Naked Island” is rather more
complicated and problematical: one
thinks of the play as a vehicle more than
as a living thing, and suspects that though
it might, if more skilfully driven, get
further along the way than it does on
this occasion, what it really needs is to
be extensively redesigned and refitted for
the journey.
The essential failure of Graeme
Henry’s production of “The Playboy”
lies in its inability to tap or its refusal
to trust the power of dialogue. Synge’s
characters are all marvellous talkers;
Mr Henry’s actors are not. If the
rhythm of these long sentences is to be
caught, they must be taken rapidly, and
then they will be not merely intelligible,
but also delightful; but if, in the interests
of clarity, they are slowed down, and
broken into bite-sized chunks, their
rhythm will be destroyed, and they will
fail even to hold the attention. This is
what happens here, with the result that
a great deal of attention-getting “busi-
ness” has to be improvised, pulling the
play badly out of shape, and cheapening
it. Undoubtedly this play would test the
best professionals in Australia, and so the
failure is an honorable one. To his credit,
Mr Henry manages a few good passages,
especially in the second act, and his
setting is very attractive.
Russell Braddon’s play deals with a
group of Australian prisoners in Changi
during the last days of the war. These
men are the news-gatherers for the camp.
On paper, their situation is a very
dangerous one: if their radio is dis-
covered, they will be executed; there is a
possibility that they will be executed any-
way, along with all of the other prisoners,
when the Japanese realise that they have
lost the war. lan Westcott's production
fails to convince us of the reality of this
danger. More generally, it fails to hold
the balance between the play’s serious and
comic elements. Changi is allowed to
approach the condition of a holiday
camp.
The trouble seems to begin with Paul


Kathner’s set, which may look right, but
does not feel right. The acting of Colin
McEwan, lan Boyce and Peter Podesta
is good up to a certain point, but they
all fail to convince whenever they are
called upon to emote or philosophise.
They are not assisted by a production
which saves its subtlety and emphasis for
the jokes, and consigns the serious
passages of the play to a series of abrupt
fortissimos.
But it is clear that Mr Westcott and
his cast have the play against them to a
large extent. Mr Braddon’s comic
writing is skilled and assured; his serious
writing, though it manages a few impres-
sive images, is, on the whole, much less
interesting. It is possible that another
production might find better ways of
underlining the themes and tightening the
suspense. But clearly what is needed,
if Mr Braddon is really convinced that
Changi is his subject, is a thorough-going
revision of the text, on the basis of
theatre-workshop experience.

FILMS
Lonely Boy
The Loneliness of the Long-Distance
Runner. Director, Tony Richard-
son. Embassy Theatre, Sydney.
A part from the recurrent financial
crises, the English film industry had
for many years to contend with an atti-
tude of condescension. Movies, it was felt,
were a poor relation of the arts some-
thing that actors and directors only
turned to when they chanced not to be
busy in their real sphere, the theatre.
Only rare exceptions like “Love on
the Dole” or “Millions Like Us” treated
the underdogs as people rather than
members of a class who ought to know
their place.
Tony Richardson, Karel Reisz, Bryan
Forbes, John Schlesinger, Lindsay An-
derson these are the names cited as
the apostles of “neo-realism”. But de-
spite their vociferous espousal of the
cause of the provincial lower classes,
the old class-consciousness is often very
apparent in an inverted form.
Richardson and Reisz in particular
have an air of slumming; however “neo-
realistic” their work is, there’s an un-
dertone of “Look, I’m not a bit snob-
bish”. Forbes and Schlesinger, by making
films about people who just happen to be
poor or working class, avoid this false
humility.
Tony Richardson (“Look Back in
Anger”, “A Taste of Honey”) has won
himself a reputation as a director which
seems to me largely unjustified. Not
that any of his films has been without
value he chooses strong plots and
casts them well but they seem to me
pretentious, gimmicky and awkwardly
constructed.
“The Loneliness of the Long-Distance
Runner” is a typical Richardson film.
Its plot is valid, its performance strong
and in one case brilliant; but the direc-
tion is arty and tiresome.
Tom Courtenay is stunningly impres-
sive as Smith, the sullen newcomer to
a reform school whose governor (authori-
tatively played by Michael Redgrave)
believes in athletics and the team spirit
as a cure for delinquency, never suspect-
ing that his is a team and a game that
his charges don't and can’t join. Smith,
a hot contender to win a cross-country
race against the local public school boys,
throws the race at the finishing line rather
than score a victory for established
authority.
Courtenay’s wonderfully subtle per-
formance presents Smith as the very
embodiment of dumb insolence yet at
the same time as a confused, lonely boy
who must cleave to his own wrong-
headed integrity.
But Richardson’s direction does
everything possible to spoil the impact
of the clear and simple story. The
flashback technique is not only inept
here, but is used with extraordinary
clumsiness; and during the final race
there is an interminable montage sequence
showing (several times over) clips of the
boy’s past life to explain why he must
forfeit the race which Courtenay is
very well able to do without directorial
assistance
Richardson’s use of camera is affected
and fussy. He has a passion for point-
ing the camera upwards, and there are
endless upside-down shots of trees
against the sky, which evidently have
some significance for the director which
he fails to communicate. His use of
Blake’s hymn “Jerusalem” as background
music is no doubt also profoundly sym-
bolic of something or other, but I’m
hanged if I know what.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
TELEVISION
Beatledom
Two of a Kind. Channel 2. Sydney.
Beatlemania. Channel 9. Sydney.
Big Night Out. Channel 7. Sydney.
Beatles are already a myth. Their
popularity, or rather adulation, and
the attention they are receiving are now
simply taken for granted so that any
recitation or attempted explanation of
their quite phenomenal success has be-
come superfluous. All that remains is
curiosity.
Three television programmes, two of
them Beatles’ performances and the third
a coverage of their hectic American tour,
did little to satisfy that curiosity. On
the ABC’s very funny comedy pro-
gramme, “Two of a Kind”, they sang
three of their top hits, “I Wanna Hold
Your Hand”, “That Boy”, and “All My
Lovin’ ”, each of them a million seller.
The songs, in their idiom, are good; cer-
tainly, they are better than the great
bulk of hit parade trivia. Musically,
they are far more accomplished, involving
very sophisticated and very effective
harmonies, key changes and chord pro-
gressions. But that is all. The Beatles
themselves seemed to me almost totally
innocuous. Their delivery was smooth
and polished, but only occasionally did
they approach the exuberance of their
sound. Surprisingly, and disappoint-
ingly, the Beatles showed less animation
or personality than so many of their
contemporaries and imitators. That
such an exciting sound does come out
of four such unimpressive and perfunc-
tory performers is difficult to under-
stand they looked as though they were
miming, and miming unconvincingly.
They stood throughout almost immobile,
except for a vague bow-legged bounce
and a toss of that hair every now and
again; they stood and they grinned. Cer-
tainly they grinned amiably enough,
they were in fact very likeable, but they
just did not look like the most sensa-
tional success in show business history.
Admittedly, both in “Two of a Kind”
and in Channel 7’s awful English variety
spectacular, “Big Night Out”, they were
most unimaginatively presented. They
were given little freedom to move and
precious little time to do anything but'
sing. In “Beatlemania”, which consisted
mainly of a frenzied hand-held camera
coverage of their airport receptions, Press
conferences and the fan reaction, some
of their much-quoted fun and wit
emerged through the general chaos.
They are intelligent and vivacious young
men, happily aware of the havoc they
are responsible for and seemingly find-
ing the whole circus rather amusing.
The Beatles are a symptom of modern
taste and their music is its anthem (“Roll
Over Beethoven” is more than the name
of a song, it’s a statement of belief).
They are, I would say, a new and un-
ambiguous focus for the growing “camp”
complexion emerging in all the arts and
in the general tendency of society.
Apparently television, or at least stodgy
English television variety, does not do
them justice. Their records reflect their
musical education and their humor and
excitement. Brief newsreels seen here
suggest that their live performances in
some part justify the hysteria with which
they are received, something which none
of their television appearances has done.
Evidently there is no Beatle like a live
Beatle, a fact which their June visit here
will decide.

POETRY
On Going Free
(To Leo Kelly )
Thunder. Cleavage. My minute and negative
Electron is set buzzing into space
Among uncharged hills and buses, and is anger.
I tell you, malnourished flowers are not alive
Nor is light light nor is green green to my hunger
Harrying inertia for the point and place
That is yourself not chair but. nucleus,
Pivot and all location for gyre and grace.
A little while ago I passed a gap
And there Canobolas hung couchant, new:
Stone and a zither of glitter and a singing
And huge veiled knees of blueness and a cap
Of cloud and leagues, and all that long hair clinging.
I stood and begged my homing, and there grew
The Child, the Pinnacle hovering into view
Frowning me on my way and on to you.
To Wild Dog Creek: a green-syrup fatigued gesture
At feckless dopy flies. One harlequin hill:
What quip of the jovial God-atom could toss
Such a lewd hill into nicely bourgeois pasture?
But to its randy shoulder clung a tree
Saintly, askew, prostrating itself to the boss
Of that hill, to gust and rain, with qualms of moss
At arms and head: charismata, aureola, cross.
I cannot know what queer heavens you inhabit
Nor what whimsical impetus fixed my sheer absurd
Shoulders around your disoriented root;
But you were my banal near-rebellious robot
Within that Ward, those walls, skittering in brute
Patternless circuits of habit at a word.
You bore the spirit in your branches like a bird.
My slackened shoulderblades creaked whenever you
stirred.

Death's in Subordinate Sydney
Now Railway Square, new sleek escape
In box cars to the suburb’s boxes,
Sand Hills Cemetery has landed safe
Between the bay and La Perouse.
Lines lay unrepenting, where
Tombstone's words are crypts
Themselves, shades of what went on
Before Judgment Day. Simeon Lord
Still dreams of emancipated kingdoms,
Although financial strings no longer
Halt his last transporting. Yet
Death crumbles, easy as these words fade,
Whose enscription holds us well on earth:
‘Prepare to follow, Will, your only love.’
BARRY ELLIOTT
Leftover Lines
Love lasts almost a life, when it's alloyed
with things far different from its goal of pleasure:
how often do we treasure
the irrelevant gift, the useless element,
time afterwards, or time we thought we wasted.
ALEXANDER CRAIG
Vision's Edge
Untalked-of fantasies dwell beyond the thinking
depths,
And quairy images of impossibilities hang in the
backdrop of the blue.
The red exerts itself in brilliant form.
Racing hot with daring strength to the fore of
vision’s edge.
The wisps of violet ether entwined in intricate
lonic grace,
A conglomerate of forms unleashed,
Elastic in their compass,
A whole of parts imperfect and unreal.
JOSEPH SERWETARZ
The Last Evening
Never again will your hand press
its comfort on my own.
There's nothing of your mortal dress,
except this motley thrown
lightly away, this piecemeal cloak
lying unmoved at last
under the hand of time that broke
bread with us in the past,
enacting day by day our long
happiness. Tears contract
to salt for ever on my tongue.
Pitying nurses act
‘‘Leave them alone'’ in starchy mime.
Evening comes close. A screen
hints at the hospital’s worst crime:
no one shall make a scene.
Evening: when sorrow walks abroad.
Vagabond shadows wake,
and, wandering in the spotless ward,
enter the heart, and shake
hopelessness like a leper's bell.
Never. Never. No sign
is given, no grace, no miracle.
Vain, all dreams of a fine
ending, a florid cadence wreathing
your life’s close, with the heart
buoyant, the deathless spirit breathing
delight that we must part
on earth for a short time to seize
our rich reward. I see
God on the crucifix, and He’s
dead. Who will comfort me?
Longer than time is the mind's passion,
and far beyond eyes’ field
nebulae stretch. In human fashion
our human speech will yield-
right answers to the questions asked
on death, on love. But you
lie quiet, ask nothing. Death has masked
like snow the world I knew.
Evening: caught in a shaft of rose
he hangs from his pieced hands,
hero or god, whose silence flows
over earth’s darkening lands.

RED PACE
Brief “Encounter”?
Triumphs and failures of a famous magazine
By PETER COLEMAN
Encounters. An anthology from the
First Ten Years of “Encounter”
Magazine. Edited by Stephen Spen-
der, Irving Kristol, Melvin J. Lasky.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. 60s. 9d.
npHERE is no concealing one’s disappoint-
A ment with this book. A selection
from the first ten years of the famous
British monthly, “Encounter”, it serves
only to make One think again about the
magazine itself.
“Encounter” was launched in 1953,
when English periodical journalism was
in the doldrums. “Horizon” had folded
in 1950, “Scrutiny”, well past its heroic
period, was soon to fold, and, as in
France, the only serious monthlies were
leftist, philistine, with an angry-smug in-
difference to such “illusions” as freedom.
Even in America “Partisan Review” had
also passed its great days.
Besides, English intellectual life gene-
rally was in a period of occasionally
charming but usually quite terrifying
self-satisfaction—hard to recall now after
the years of debate about the State of
England Question and the Angry Young
Fogies. Edward Shils caught it in his
1955 essay on “British Intellectuals”
(reproduced in this anthology):
“Continental holidays, the connoisseur-
ship of wine and food, the knowledge of
wild flowers and birds, acquaintance with
the writings of Jane Austen, a knowing
indulgence for the worthies of the English
past, an appreciation of more leisurely
epochs, doing one's job dutifully and
reliably, the cultivation of personal re-
lations —these are the elements of the
newly emerging British intellectual class.
“Outside the China of the Mandarins,
no great society has ever had a body of
intellectuals so integrated with, and so
congenial to, its ruling class, and so
combining civility and refinement. The
consensus thus achieved is remarkable”.
But its cost was “a narrowing of sensi-
bility and imagination”.
“Encounter”, in this atmosphere, was
something new and exciting. It was,
for one thing, committed to criticism and
to reversing what it considered the new
treason of the English clerks their in-
difference to world totalitarianism. It
seemed then (leaving Right-wing lunatics
aside) the only English magazine to take
Communism seriously; it had a wide-
ranging curiosity about the unexamined
England; it was avid for information
about Russia; it became an organ of
Gaitskellite discussions in the Labor
Party; it publicised the idea of European
unify; it encouraged new writers, espe-
cially Russians; and in a decade of sui-
cidal anti-Americanism it was pro-
American.
I>ut at the same time it has never quite
fulfilled its promise. It knew what it
wanted well enough, but seemed too much
a victim of Shils Disease to be able to do
it. It is significant that so many of its
best writers have been foreigners, especi-
Americans Shils, Daniel Bell,
Dwight Macdonald, Theodore Draper,
Mary McCarthy, Irving Kristol, Richard
Lowenthal, Herbert Leuthy, F. R. Alle-
man, Arthur Koestler, Raymond Aron.
But. despite editorial policy, many of its
writers, particularly the English ones,
seemed unable to come to grips with any
of the issues it raised.
Take, for example, C. P. Snow’s Two
Cultures controversy. “Encounter”, with
characteristic enterprise, was the first
magazine to carry Snow's ideas to a wide
audience, but it also seemed incapable of
profiting from the controversy. It gave a
lot of space to the shortcomings of the
literary intellectual, especially in the
fields of science, technology, and know-
ledge in general, but having got a kick
out of the affair, “Encounter” then pro-
ceeded as if nothing at all had happened.
Science is still as alien to its pages as
ever even though, on purely market
terms, magazines like “The New Scien-
tist show that the demand is there; only
the editorial flair is lacking. (At the other
extreme, one must also add that religion
is as alien to it as science: serious dis-
cussions of this have hardly ever cracked
the literary-political monopoly of its
pages.)
Again, take censorship (one of its
favorite themes, four chapters on which
are in this anthology) especially the
“Lady Chatterley’s Lover” case. On the
one hand it saw clearly enough the
absurdities of the wilder Laurentians
and published Katherine Anne Porter’s
criticism of the book’s literary merits and
John Sparrow's exposure of the blind-
spots of some of those who gave evidence
for the publishers of the book (publishers,
incidentally, who deserved better wit-
nesses). But it soon became clear that
more than this was needed, that the Chat-
terley movement—bishops who saw the
“Lover” as a sacred Protestant work,
Catholics who saw Lawrence as a Catho-
lic seer, Socialists who saw him as a
Left-liberal hero, and intellectuals gen-
erally who, out of anti-censorship ritu-
alism, were able to see one of Lawrence’s
lesser works and an uncharacteristic
attack on marriage as great literature and
a criticism of marriage—that this move-
ment was more than an aberration, and
was a new orthodoxy in which com-
monsense and rigorous criticism were
alike confounded. Fortunately on this
occasion it was against a stupid act of
censorship, but how could one ever rely
on them again in any other intellectual,
social or political question?
“Encounter”, in the end, belongs to
this movement. It is a dissident member,
a superior member, its enfant terrible if
you like but still part of it. Except
for occasional, evasive, ironical com-
ments it joins in. It was still only
F. R. Leavis, erratic, unreliable, ageing,
scornful of "Encounter”, who remained
unmoved by this new, if minor, treason
of the clerks.
Perhaps a symbol of "Encounter’s”
real failure is that on the one issue where
it was impossible to be evasive the
State of England Question it left it too
late and then abdicated in favor of a
guest editor (Koestler), inviting him to
bring out a special number. (That the
issue was so bad it finally killed the
Question off is another matter.)
Having said all that it seems ungrate-
ful, remembering the excitement with
which one read its good numbers, not
to emphasise again its triumphs. What
would we have done these last ten years
from the death of Stalin through the
Hungarian Revolution to General de


Gaulle’s No—without its commentaries
on international affairs? Where else
were there accounts of British intellectual
and social controversies (Trevor-Roper
on English historians, Colin Clark v.
Peter Wiles, Colin Welch against Enid
Blyton, etc.) and the long list of general
discussions from Oakeshott on Burck-
hardfc to Trilling on “Mansfield Park”?
My complaint is simply that it is these
things which are not fairly reflected in
this anthology, with its emphasis on
belles-lettres and famous names even
when they are represented by inferior
work. We get in this anthology a num-
ber of first-class travel articles, for ex-
ample, Melvin Lasky on India; some
excellent off-beat reporting (Robert
Graves on the Whitaker Negroes) and
informal sociology (Wayland Young on
London prostitution); good accounts of
past thinkers (Isaiah Berlin on Herzen).
But there is nothing from Angus Wilson
or Richard Lowenthal, some second-rate
conversational pieces from Arthur Koest-
ler, Mary McCarthy and Daniel Bell.
There is hardly a word about world
affairs, and one-third of the book is
verse and fiction an extraordinary
proportion when one remembers that it
is one of the good things about “Encoun-
ter” that verse and fiction have to be
good to get in which means very
little gets in.
This book, for all the good things in
it, has to be criticised because it could
have been so much better. One only
hopes its belle-lettrisme doesn’t represent
“Encounter's” New Direction for the
19605, for in that case its often predicted
decline will become a certainty.
Comedians
The English Comic Characters.
J. B. Priestley. Bodley Head. 16s.
English have two national literary
institutions. One is Shakespeare;
the other the gallery of comic portraits
to which Shakespeare himself made so
notable a contribution. When the Eng-
lish pride themselves even today on their
sense of humor, they do so with the
calm superiority of those whose ancestry
is beyond suspicion. How can a nation
fail to be superior (not in wit, perhaps,
but in humor) when it can admire on its
family tree the names of Sir John Fal-
staff, Sir Toby Belch, Uncle Toby, Sam
Weller, Mr Micawber, and a host of
minor relatives?
This is Mr Priestley’s domain the
great comic world of the English drama
and novel. Falstaff and Sir Toby Belch
are here, and so too are some of the
lesser Shakespearean “drolls” Bottom
and Touchstone, Shallow and Silence.
Then we have Fielding (represented by
Parson Adams), Sterne, Austen (Mr Col-
lins), Dickens, and Peacock (whose
Prince Siethenyn surely does not rank
with the rest).
“The English Comic Characters” was
first published nearly forty years ago,
when, as the author tells us in the pre-
face to this new edition, he was a young
man “hard-pressed and desperate”. It
is a wonder, he feels, looking back, that
he could ever have written it at all, so
miserable were his personal circum-
stances; and he makes no bones about
the fact that he wrote because he needed
the money a goad which many wri-
ters know, but relatively few acknow-
ledge.
But this is 1964, not 1924 (the year
of its writing), and “The English Comic
Characters”, whatever its history, has to
be seen in its present, not its past, per-
spective. A modern reader is likely to
be surprised, not that a miserable young
man was able to write with zest about
comedy, but that he had the courage to
tackle the subject at all. I do not think
many young critics or literary men to-
day would lightly plunge into a book of
essays on the major figures of English
comic writing; and they would reject the
subject not necessarily through coward-
ice but because literary comment is now
a business and profession and not (for
most people engaged in it) a hobby or
pastime. Moreover it is a highly specia-
lised business, and there are many cri-
tics who would not feel competent to
cover the area so cheerfully traversed by
Mr Priestley, and at the same time main-
tain the standards which the best
modern criticism demands.
In short, the republication of this
book makes one acutely aware of the
change which has taken place in English
literary studies in the last forty years.
Priestley’s essays are readable, graceful,
and require no effort of concentration,
and little knowledge of the subjects dis-
cussed. No one who was not at least
in a general way interested in English
comedy would bother to read them, but
those general readers could include a
good many people whose memories of
the text are dim. They would be at
no disadvantage: for neither their general
knowledge of the text nor their general
background would be put to the test.
In his preface, Mr Priestley rather
surprisingly confesses that he has been
reading the early reviews of his book,
and he makes a point of informing his
readers that only about one in eight were
at all “sour or dubious”. (Is this in-
tended as a warning to modern review-
ers?). He does though quote one critic,
and a very distinguished one Leonard
Woolf who pointed out that he had
concentrated on entertainment rather
than on serious analytical criticism. At
the same time he insisted that more seri-
ous criticism need in no sense be less
entertaining. Here Woolf has put his
finger on the weakness in all these
essays one more obvious now, per-
haps, than it was then. Priestley says
nothing about his characters that could
not be said by a reasonably intelligent
reader (not student) of the texts. Apart
from the fact that he has clearly enjoyed
meeting his team of funny men, he does
not seem particularly well qualified to
write about them. One of his models
in this exercise in character analysis and
comment is Hazlitt, to whom, with
A. C. Bradley, he frequently refers. But
Hazlitt demonstrates an individuality and
critical acuteness that are not evident in
Priestley's writing. Nor is there to be
discovered any view about comedy as a
form; so that while at first glance his
scheme seems to be an enormously am-
bitious one, in fact his ambitions are
modest and his examinations cursory.
He writes apparently with little know-
ledge of the background and critical
material which might have sharpened his
own opinions; more particularly he
writes as though this knowledge were
unnecessary.
In criticising the vagueness of these
essays and their failure to come to
grips with the literary issues they raise,
and their more serious failure to distin-
guish between kinds of comedy, I am not
demanding that the book turn itself into
something it was never intended to be
namely, a scholarly dissertation, care-
fully bled of enthusiasm, and deadly
pale from its efforts at dedicated de-
tachment. I do not pine for the missing
footnotes and the learned doubts. But
I do question the value of a book of this
kind today. The modern critical essay
(and I am not thinking of articles in
scholarly journals) is altogether more
exploratory, more alert and disputative
than any in this collection. Further, so
many good minds have applied them-
selves to these subjects since 1924 that
it would take an intelligence sharper and
more incisive than Mr Priestley’s to meet
their challenge. Hazlitt survives, but his
disciple is eclipsed.
There are several reasons for this. For
the most part, Priestley stands between
his comic characters and his audience
not as an interpreter but as a demon-
strator who points out what is plainly
to be seen by all but the totally blind.
When he does occasionally attempt
something more like interpretation, he
seems to me to go astray. For example,
his attempt to reconcile the character
of Parson Adams with Fielding’s com-
ments on the ridiculous is plain indica-
tion that he has not begun to see where-
in Adams’s comic significance lies.
But chiefly one is aware in these
essays of the divorce of the characters
themselves from their manner of pre-
sentation. Only occasionally does
Priestley remind us in a passing remark

that Falstaff and Sir Toby and the rest
of them were made and not born; and
that they were made by that most com-
plex and intricate of instruments,
language. Though, to be sure, we recog-
nise Falstaff by his belly and his be-
havior, we recognise him too, and in-
deed come to know him, by his habit of
speech. Though Priestley quotes some
of the speeches of his various characters,
it is for their content not their quality.
No one can talk significantly about any
great writer without at some point test-
ing the flavor of his language. Mr
Collins appears to us as he does not
just because he expresses certain opin-
ions and adopts certain attitudes but
because the tone of his voice tells us
what lies behind those attitudes. Most
particularly is this the case with Sterne,
whose syntactical tricks, interpolations
and even extravagant pauses are part of
his exploration of human beings. So
that when Priestley quotes one of Mr
and Mrs Shandy’s bolster conversations,
without drawing attention to the pace
and tone of their speech, he has found
for us only part of their character and
part of the comedy.
This is perhaps the respect in which
Mr Priestley’s criticism seems most
dated. It moves along with enthusiasm,
neatly paraphrasing and appreciatively
expounding. But it moves only on the
surface of its subject, and while he per-
suades us of the virtues of his good com-
panions, he does not bring us any closer
to them. Yet he has one gift which
some of the more rigorous and percep-
tive critics of 1964 could emulate with
profit he writes as though above all
else he wanted to write. He measures
his skill against formidable subjects, and
it he does not meet their challenge
triumphantly, he at least makes one mar-
vel yet again at the unparalleled richness
of the English comic spirit.

Melbourne Churches, 1836-1851.
J. M. Freeland. Melbourne Univer-
sity Press. £5 ss.
This somewhat ornately conceived
volume, enclosed in a case which,
alas, is too small for it so that the copy
I have needs to be prised from its shell,
is described by the author on his title
page as an “architectural record”.
If it were merely that, it could be dis-
missed as something in the much-ado-
about-nothing class; for architecturally
most of the churches of Melbourne in
the period covered did little credit to
their architects; and some may be said
to have had no architects at all.
There are 56 buildings dealt with in
the book, from the pioneer shack which
was called a church put up in 1836 to
the first tabernacles of the era of the
gold rushes. Only five remain as
churches and two of them, St Peter’s,
Eastern Hill, and St John’s, Heidelberg,
alone are roughly as their designers left
them. The earliest that conformed in
any shape to the standards of church
building was Russell’s strange pepper-
box-topped St James’s Pro-Cathedral in
William Street, built in 1839. It has
been, so to speak, since translated to the
heaven of King Street (Melbourne) in
something like its original semblance.
One of the surviving original churches
is a storeroom today and others are a
warehouse, a box factory, a knitting mill,
a motor garage and service station. All
these functions are in keeping with their
shapes and nature.
However, Mr Freeland’s essay is not
quite what it purports to be. Well pro-
duced in type, with excellent paper and
the illustrations grouped and captioned
with the date and the name of the archi-
tect, the book is rather a survey of the
modes of living, the limitations and range
of materials, the difficulties of architects
and builders in the raffish years of Mel-
bourne’s burgeoning, than a mere archi-
tectural essay. From this point of view
it is a very excellent piece of historical
exposition of a type that historians will
find more useful than architects.
There is very little about it even for
the most captious to criticise, though one
might be inclined to differ from some of
Mr Freeland’s judgments in the biogra-
phical section, e.g., that Charles Laing
was superior in architectural status to
Russell and Jackson because he drew
meticulous plans in contrast to the two
pioneers who “preferred to direct by
verbal on-site instructions and whose
drawings were bare outlines devoid of
all but the most basic dimensions or
information”.
After all, Greenway, who was pro-
bably a pupil of Repton the younger
and possibly also of Nash and who was
eminent enough to be supervising archi-
tect of one of the most famous of Western
English churches, St Mary Redcliffe in
Bristol, followed the method of Russell
and Jackson. By trial and error and
walls and windows sketched for the
master mason on stone, he achieved such
buildings as the Sydney Convict Bar-
racks, St James’s Church, Sydney and
St Matthew’s, Windsor.
Some of the finest of the world’s
mediaeval buildings owe their origin to
architects who gave “on-site instruc-
tions” but who had the advantage of
being expert carvers, stonemasons
and brickmakers who could take a chisel
and do their own fashioning to instruct
an artisan, or settle down and experi-
ment with a lovely collection of stone
to carry changing light along a wall and
bring out the mottle of shadows at even-
ing. These were artists rather than
draftsmen, and even men like Blackett
and Verge were not devoid of practical
capacity in the arts.
Mr Freeland’s book will certainly be
a collector’s piece, apart from the fact
that it adds something useful to the
fabric of early Australian history.

Procrustes’ Bed
The Book of Fub. Michael Frayn.
Collins. 20s.
The task of a humorous newspaper
columnist is notoriously Sisyphean.
Once or twice a week, sometimes even
daily, he’s condemned to “say something
funny.” Most columnists soon master
the art of stretching a thin idea to fit an
allotted space (a further law for Profes-
sor Parkinson perhaps?), the effect being
to give an illusion of humor rather than
of actually capturing humor itself. Fortu-
nately, a complementary process in the
reader leads him to an innate sympathy
and understanding of the columnist’s role


ana ne necomes conditioned to judging
the offering on those terms.
But when the columnist’s pieces are
collected in book form, as Michael
Frayn's pieces from the “Manchester
Guardian” have been in “The Book of
Fub,” the greater obtrusiveness of the
material, removed from the competition
of surrounding world news, letters to the
editor and weather reports, together with
the plea for lasting recognition which is
inherent in collections between hard
covers, prompts a judgment based on a
different set of criteria.
Judged by these latter standards, “The
Book of Fub” doesn't quite come off.
In spite of the promises of the jacket,
Frayn is not really a satirist. Nor is he
the sort of humorist to move his readers
to outright laughter in bus or train. His
ridicule never strikes very deep. His
targets are the predictable ones
politicians, advertising, public relations
men, TV interviewers, rock and rollers;
on the rare occasions when he does touch
on any subject that might be considered
controversial, religion, loyalty, the Estab-
lishment or clearly recognisable poli-
ticians, we are led by the conciliatory
tone of his prose and his extremes of
fantasy to the conclusion that he is not
seriously complaining and it is difficult
to imagine his quarry finding him more
than a minor irritation.
His favorite targets, for the most part,
are the sham and phoniness inherent in
mass culture. But if Frayn's humor lacks
bite, his genteel little nibbles do have a
whimsical charm that tends to be cumu-
lative. His world is a highly individual
one revolving around typically English
towns such as Screwe (“that beautiful
gem of industrial England”) and Twice-
ster (with its seat of learning, Twicester
U). It is peopled by politicians such as
Mr Nigel Sharpe-Groomsman; Christo-
pher Smoothe, the Minister of Chance
and Speculation (who firmly believes in
the “fundamental Conservative principle
of leaving all human affairs to the free
operation of chance"); his public re-
lations consultant Rollo Swavely and the
Michael Michaels advertising agency
(handling the Harris-Harris account).
These and other inhabitants of Frayn’s
world direct their lives on the guiding
principles contained in the “Book of
Fub,” a kind of bible of sham and
trickery.
Among the pieces I liked best, the
following come to mind: “Head to
Head,” about a Latin country where
successive revolutions change Presidents
four times in as many minutes, because
it was more of a “natural” than most of
the pieces; “Lloyd”, “a historical tragi-
budget” in Shakespearean style; some of
“Marginalia” because it came closest to
satire; and “Ha Lo and the Electric
Talker”, about a Chinese trying to make
a telephone call, because I found it the
funniest —though there is room for doubt
whether Oriental readers would find its
pidgin-Chinese quite as amusing.

Berlioz
Evenings in the Orchestra. Hector
Berlioz. Penguin. 17s. 6d.
Music Criticism. Eduard Hanslick.
Penguin. 19s. 6d.
T>erlioz took up music criticism in 1829
because he needed the money, and
never ceased to detest the occupation in
the thirty-five years he practised it. At
best, it kept him away from composition;
at worst, it forced him “to write nothings
about nothings, to bestow lukewarm
praise on unbearable insipidities”, to
squander his time and energy on the
impossible task of reforming the de-
cadent musical standards of the Paris of
his day.
Notwithstanding this, Berlioz was a
brilliant writer: “Evenings in the Orch-
estra”, which consists partly of previously
published reviews, displays a fluency,
command of ideas, wit and poise that no
other writer on music, Shaw included,
has ever matched. In this book Berlioz's
world comes vividly to life—the world
of claques, of tenors, of opera producers,
of ninth-rate operas, of Paganini.
Dominating it is Berlioz himself, now
subjecting some luckless contemporary
to a devastating burst of sarcasm, now
telling a Hoffmanesque story, now
describing the ideal musical society.
Berlioz makes no pretence • of being
“objective” about things: his judgments
are supported not by argument, but by
sheer force of personality; nevertheless,
his assessments are never merely idiosyn-
cratic: he is a detached and dispassionate
observer, and his enthusiasms and dislikes
are the natural outcome of a great artist's
love of good art and contempt for bad.
“Evenings in the Orchestra” is a
fascinating book, whether regarded as an
introduction to the mind of a great
musician, as an historical document, or
simply as literature. It is therefore re-
grettable that a number of passages have
been needlessly omitted from this new
translation of it—a fault which should
be rectified in any future edition.
Hanslick was Berlioz's opposite in
almost every way. He was by choice a
professional music critic, and had
enormous influence in his day (Verdi
called him “the Bismarck of criticism”).
Deeply conscious of his responsibility, he
avoided all hint of bias or partisanship;
his reviews are sober, judicious, carefully
argued. He was a conservative, critical
of the “new music” of Berlioz, Liszt and
Wagner.
This collection of his musical journal-
ism contains much of great interest—
notices of a recital given in Vienna by
the ageing Liszt, of the first performances
of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony and
of Brahms’ symphonies, and a memoir
of Adelina Patti. But Hanslick’s concern
for objectivity makes his reviews rather
dull reading compared with Berlioz’s.
Moreover, it does not keep him free from
the kind of dogmatism he wanted to
avoid. His essays on “Tristan and Isolde”
and on Tchaikowsky’s “Pathetique”
Symphony make use of some quite out-
landish arguments against those works.
For these reasons, the book is of more
interest as an historical document than
as an addition to literature, critical or
otherwise.

Innocence
The Battle of the Villa Fioretta. Rumer
Godden. Macmillan. 265.
The Path of Dalliance. Auberon
Waugh. Chapman and Hall. 265. •
A n air of tenderness pervades this book
by Rumer Godden. Against her
principles, almost against her will, Fanny
has come to love another man. After
the divorce he has taken her to a lake-
side villa in Italy until the decree is made
absolute and they can marry. Taken for
granted by her husband for years,
Fanny's unaccustomed delight in being
tenderly looked after is shown with
delicacy and truth. The story revolves
round the effect of the divorce on her
young family; the two younger children,
Caddie (11) and Hugh (14), decide to
follow her from London. Having achieved
this, they arrive dirty, tired and hungry
one evening; their mother is out, they
explore the empty house. When Fanny
returns she finds the atmosphere of peace
and delight, of sparkling lake, olive grove
and singing birds has receded.
Once again Rumer Godden has shown
her gift for getting inside the mind of
children of this age; the same quality
appears here as in “The River” and “The
Greengage Summer.” Fanny and Rob
are both tender, honest and sensitive
people, and. the situation has an un-
expected ending described without senti-
mentality and with great delicacy.
If innocence surrounds the children of
the Villa Fioretta, it is completely absent
from Auberon Waugh’s “Path of Dalli-
ance.” The emotional experiments of
immature undergraduates, their college
escapades and sometimes laughable mis-
understandings become simply boring. So
are the earnest (or would-be earnest)
discussions on life or politics with the
ribbon of sex running through them,
especially when an Inner Cell group holds
a social evening. The general effect is
one of confused superficiality and heart-
lessness.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Not-so-rosy Interims
A cautious rate of new lending by the trading banks, the
freezing of additional liquid funds .by the Reserve Bank,
and some not-so-buoyant interim company reports last
week gave the Australian share markets food for thought.
Malaysian conscription call-ups created further nervousness
and, as a result, share prices lost some of their recent buoy-
ancy.
Reserve Bank controls and the use of a flexible interest
rate, as reiterated so often, are far preferable to sledgehammer
blows at the economy if expansion rushes ahead too quickly
and in the wrong direction, with much-needed growth ham-
pered or curtailed by rising costs. So the share market
wasn’t too dismayed at the bank call-ups.
But interim company reports are a different matter. They
must be analysed on the grounds of performance and re-
lated to the likely prospects of the remaining months in the
1963-64 financial year. After reading reports of steady ex-
pansion in the economy in the half-year to December, it is
important to note that there was still a sprinkling of com-
panies to report that trading was “difficult”.
Tancred Brothers Industries, wholesale butcher and meat
exporter, last week reported substantially reduced profits from
higher turnover. The company put the major part of the
blame on higher livestock prices.
Amalgamated Chemicals Ltd, which spent increased
amounts on research in the agricultural field, reported a sharp
drop in earning rate, but lifted its dividend for the year to
December.
Marco Productions Ltd, a
manufacturer of men’s clothing,
after passing its final dividend
last October, also failed to pay
an interim dividend after diffi-
cult trading.
Even the giant Myer Em-
porium retail group managed
only a 6 p.c. rise in sales in the
half-year to January but, because
of careful control of expenses,
achieved a higher profit.
York Motors, vehicle distri-
butor, reports that turnover rose
but trading profit margins were
lower because of increased com-
petition.
This cross-section of com-
panies, representing five indus-
tries, illustrates that the public
is still gaining the benefit of
price stability and price com-
petition. If inflation is kept in
check, there are good grounds
for forecasting sound growth this
In general, world commodity prices continue to boom, as is
illustrated by the above graph of wholesale price indexes cover-
ing materials and foodstuffs. (Source: The Statist, of Lon-
don.) Among base metals, copper and tin have provided most
of the recent excitement for the Australian economy. Wool
has remained firm, while sugar has retreated. The situation
for sugar and tin is discussed on this page and the next.
year, despite the threatened basic wage increase. It is to
be hoped that price competition also is retained in the build-
ing industries where some cost strain is appearing.
Resistance to High
Sugar Prices
THhe recent decline in London sugar prices to around
A £stg6s per ton emphasises that adjustments can be just
as sharp after a period of over-enthusiasm. Open market
prices in London were around £stglos in early November,
when Britain blandly announced it would continue to pay
Commonwealth producers the same price in 1964 as in 1963,
namely £stg46 Os. lOd. per ton. At that time, Australia’s
quota was lifted 5 p.c. to 330,000 tons per annum and she
was free to go on the open market for any surplus production.
Nations who were forced to buy on the open market at
that time were hostile at the sharp jump in prices and a
natural consumer resistance occurred. The Canadians, for
example, resented bitterly that they had to pay twice as much
for sugar as their American neighbors.
Meanwhile, the sugar producers rubbed their hands glee-
fully as they chortled over reports that sugar demand would
be 2i million tons in excess of supplies in 1964.
Figures now coming to hand indicate that higher sugar
prices have caused a revision in
the anticipated two million tons
annual increase in world con-
sumption; also that synthetic
sweeteners have received a big
stimulus, particularly in the US.
As a result, a Department of
Agriculture spokesman in the
US said last week that the US
market for sugar had ceased
growing at its usual rate.
This doubtless comes as a
surprise to sugar producers who
have made vigorous efforts to
increase output to take advantage
of the price boom; so much so
that the world productive capa-
city should be substantially
higher by the end of this year.
The US Foreign Agricultural
Service quotes Australia, Brazil
and Mexico as three important
producers with long-range plans
to increase productive capacity.
It also points out that many


near-self-sufficient producers have embarked on programmes
to meet local demands for sugar and, if possible, earn a little
from exports.
All this clearly suggests that a sustained demand for sugar
will depend on a reasonable open market price for the
commodity. Producers have been sobered already by US
statistics which show that production is running at a higher
rate than earlier forecasts.
Traders claim they still expect a recovery in prices, an
opinion statistically stronger than when prices were in the
high seventies. In a nervous market, where buyers are hold-
ing off, prices have dipped lower than expected, and opera-
tors claim that strong buying must occur, because Italy is
known to need 300,000 tons and Russian buying (long awaited)
could be a signal for a sharp recovery.
In this atmosphere, market conditions have not been helped
by reports that Ceylon bought a large quantity of Thailand
raw sugar for £stg64 a ton and that some second-hand cargoes
of sugar have been unloaded at prices well under the market.
It must be reasonable to assume that the lower prices will
attract those buyers who have been resisting higher levels
of between £stg7o to £stglos a ton and the testing period
probably will come in the May-July period when supplies
are tight because of the gap between the two world harvests.
But the lesson is clear. Those in need of sugar obviously
are prepared to do without when prices go too high.
Tin Prices Well Braked
by US Stockpile
Speculators, and not users, were principally responsible for
the wild oscillations in world tin prices a fortnight ago,
though users bought quite solidly in both London and Penang.
With levels pushing around £stgl24o a ton, the US stockpile
authorities felt it necessary to curb some of the violence.
After 2765 tons left in the current pool sold very quickly
in America (the United States Steel Company, for instance,
buying stockpile tin for the first time), a further 5000 tons
were immediately made available. They came ahead of and
separately from the new release programme to start on April 1.
Though it is improbable that all of the latest release can be
speedily absorbed, speculative ardors have certainly been
cooled. Most observers don’t expect another mad price burst
for a long time.
One thing is becoming clear: Australian producers are not
the only ones trying to fill the gap between current supply and
demand. More mines are being reopened in Malaya, where
the number now in operation approaches the high 1957 total.
Retail Price Maintenance
in Britain
A pparently few bills in Britain have had as tortuous a draft-
ing path as the Retail Prices Bill which the UK Govern-
ment hopes to get passed before Easter despite strong back
bench opposition. Its aim, of course, is to abolish retail price
maintenance and in the event of the restrictive practices pro-
posals being implemented here, one would trust there would be
similar compromises as in the UK bill in the interest of preserv-
ing the main structure of orderly marketing. Without it a chaotic
situation would emerge in industry and commerce.
It seems incredible that Australian business is being let into
a similar legal wilderness in the interest of justifying theoretical
conceptions of free competition. If not from the main British
rules, then business here may take some heart from the per-
mitted exceptions to the abolition of retail price maintenance
there.
Apart from the clause dealing with “loss leaders”, which
says, virtually, that a manufacturer may cease to supply a
retailer who, apart from seasonal or clearance sales, has been
selling goods at below wholesale prices, it is possible under the
Bill for manufacturers to obtain complete exemption. (They
will have three months after the Bill is passed to decide whether
to apply for it.)
Those who seek exemption will have to show reasons why
the abolition of retail price maintenance would be to the
detriment of the public. Three reasons are permitted under
the Bill. These are that abolition of RPM could lead to a
substantial reduction in the variety or the quality of the goods
sold; a substantial loss of retail outlets; or the cessation or the
substantial reduction of necessary services provided with or
after the sale of such goods.
Among those liable to be worst hit by the Bill are the small
ironmonger and kitchen equipment salesmen. The retail mark-
ups on several well known brands of kitchen and household
goods and domestic equipment in Britain, as here, are quite
high and very keen price-cutting is expected if manufacturers
are debarred from withholding supplies from retailers who sell
below recommended levels.
No Easy Market for
WA Iron Ore
QJtill another mission from the Japanese steel industry is due
to conduct a further examination of Western Australia’s
capacious iron ore deposits next month. Hopes for firm
contracts run high, with the name of CRA-Kaiser Steel well
to the fore.
Too much optimism should not be engendered by these
periodical visits. Any foreseeable contracts can hardly be
expected to make much impression on the huge, already
proven reserves.
Japanese steelmakers act together in their ore (and coal)
purchases, taking full advantage of new sources discovered
all over the world in recent years. Current quotas in the
buying programme projected to 1970 do not allow a great
deal to Australia.
One advantage Australia does possess, however its poli-
tical stability. Bargain prices negotiated with some South
American States, for example, may not prove so advantageous
in the long term.
Aircraft Industries Grow Shy
of Supersonic Race
sorry plight of a once-ascendant British aircraft industry,
A built upon a narrow home market and struggling against
better founded American competition, is examined in an article
on page 57.
Rivalry, of course, culminates in the rather feverish race to
produce a supersonic transport the next technical step in
air travel. But the financial and other problems involved seem
lately to have changed the basic shallowness of a “get-there-
first” approach.
Though the Americans have yet to choose their final design,
the US industry has already complained that it cannot really
bear 25 p.c. of the costs as envisaged by the Government,
which itself was to shoulder 75 p.c. Something more like
10 p.c. is being suggested for private investment.
Some US sources also depreciate the idea of trying to put
the American SST into the air too quickly after the Anglo-
French Concorde. The airways can probably absorb both and
in any case must attempt to avoid the financial fiascos accom-
panying introduction of the early jet models.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
What Limits to the Housing Boom?
The growing shortage of skilled labor
Qpeaking at the annual conference of
the Federation of Co-operative
Housing Societies of Victoria, at Lome
last w'eek, Mr • Leslie Bury, the first
Federal Minister for Housing, gave the
impression that as an economist he
might be apprehensive about a building
boom putting an intolerable strain on
economic resources later this year.
Naturally at a conference of dedica-
ted housing people the emphasis was
on the need for more, better, and
cheaper houses, but there are already
indications of a growing shortage of
skilled labor in the building industry
and of rapidly rising investment in
other sectors of the economy, posing
the possibility of eventual strain on
material resources as well.
Mr Bury certainly starts his ministry
with not only an embarrassment of poli-
tical housing promises but also an em-
barrassment of rich housing statistics.
What with the £250 gift scheme and
support from savings bank lending be-
ing sustained throughout 1964 at the
much higher rate reached in the last
half of 1963, Mr Bury would appear
to have ample financial ammunition to
hit even higher targets.
However, in saying that one of the
several problems facing his department
was the flow of finance in relation to
the stability of the economy, he was
obviously going beyond the strict ques-
tion of the availability of money for
housing, and thinking of the gearing of
investment in housing into the general
structure of a rising investment platform,
housing’s claim on the overall flow of
resources available for investment, and
also its effect on the level of effective
demand.
three aspects are all of funda-
• mental importance in charting the
future course of the economy, and it
is probably just as well that the two
keepers of the new Ministry for
Housing are, in fact, tw'o acknowledged
economic experts. Both Mr Bury and
Mr J. F. Nimmo, the Secretary of the
Department, served long periods in the
Treasury under Sir Roland Wilson.
Going on his resignation from the
Ministry over the Common Market
issue, obviously Mr Bury is not going
to let his economic horse-sense be over-
ridden by any political ambitions he
may have in forcing the pace of housing
or, for that matter, that of the develop-
ment of his department. (At Lome he
spoke of the difficulties in finding
trained personnel for his department
and also of the need for a great deal of
collation of already known housing
data, a scheme for overcoming the
shortage of building apprentices, and
for much more intensive research into
housing itself.)
Happily for the economy, his attitude
seems to be in marked contrast to that,
say, of Mr R. W. C. Anderson, the
Federal director of the Associated
Chambers of Manufactures, who has
recently been plugging the case for
pushing the economy to the limit
“now is the time we need to be coura-
geous and push the economy to its
limits" . . . “reap the fruits of rapid
growth and not let them wither away
on us”.
IThe December, 1963, quarter estimates
of national income and expendi-
ture indicate pretty clearly that up to
the end of last year the platform of
overall investment in the economy could
be lifted a good deal higher without
causing excessive pressure on resources.
In saying this, it has to be taken into
account that resources for local use
could be increased substantially by im-
ports in current circumstances by draw-
ing down overseas funds, which are
now well over £BOO million, the highest
ever, and also the fact that many in-
dustries are still working below capacity
here.
Although the £521 million total gross
fixed capital investment in the Decem-
ber, 1963, quarter was below the re-
cord amount of £537 million spent
in the June quarter. 1963, account
should be taken of the fact that the
June quarter, being the last quarter in
the financial year, its fixed capita!
spending in the period is invariably
accelerated in order to get budgets
spent.
A more realistic comparison is be-
tween the December quarter’s £521
million with the December, 1962, quar-
ter's total of £482 million, an increase
of about 8 p.c. However, despite this
increase the proportion (21.6 p.c.) of
gross fixed investment to GNP was
slightly lower in the December, 1963,
quarter to that in the December, 1962,
quarter, when it was 21.7 p.c. As a rule
of thumb measure taken in conjunction
with the stability of prices during the
quarter, this comparison suggests that
the rise in fixed capital investment has
been comfortably accommodated with-
out causing undue strain on resources.
It is presumed Mr Bury will have al-
ready noted that percentage-wise the rise
of 9.8 p.c. in fixed investment in hous-
ing in the December, 1963, quarter over
December, 1962, was the second highest
of all the Commonwealth Statistician’s
categories under this head, and that the
biggest increase was one of 16 p.c. by
public authorities, with public enter-
prises a good third with a rise of 9.6
p.c.
TjkoUBTLESs Mr Bury will get some en-
couragement from the fact that
(again taking the December quarter com-
parison) fixed investment in building and
construction other than dwellings show-
ed only a small increase of 4} p.c. on
the year, because clearly he has ulti-
mately most to fear from the competi-
tion for resources from non-dwelling
construction.
nobody is suggesting that,
except for labor, the present competi-
tion for resources between the two arms
of building is intolerable, this is where
the amber light could first show up for
the new Federal Department for Hous-
ing, and it would almost certainly start
flashing long before any strain of total
fixed capital investment on resources in
general become patent.
Some observers seem to think that we
have still a good way to go before private
investment in plant and equipment puts
a strain on resources and, as Mr R. W. C.
Anderson did the other day, compare
danger signals of pressure on building
resources with the general situation of
fixed investment where unused industrial
capacity is a deterrent to a breakaway.
Despite that, going on the Statistician’s
figures, investment in plant and equip-
ment at £l7l million was pretty nearly
a record in the December, 1963. quarter,
having only been exceeded in the June
quarter last year, which, as has been
stated, reflects seasonal influences.
Obviously many firms which would
normally go to the capital market for
funds for this purpose are well enough
pursed up to finance their current fixed
capital needs without recourse to the
market, despite rates of interest being
more attractive for borrowers than they
have been for some years.
It would be expected that this situation
will change more because fixed invest-
ment is rising steadily and company re-
sources are being gradually absorbed by
it than because of possible changes in
interest rates.
Even in the event of such changes be-
ing against borrowers, I would still look
for a further strong increase in invest-
ment in plant and equipment, and this
would, in turn, possibly squeeze resources
available for housing—but not yet awhile.


Digging Graves for Management
Sir Walter Puckey one of the worst culprits
llThy is it that so many books on man-
agement are rambling and woolly,
imprecise, tentative, vague almost, when
management itself, whether it be top
management or in the lower industrial
echelons such as foremen, is usually such
a cut and dried business demanding clear
and unequivocal decisions, each with a
commercial label on it?
Is it too much for writers on the sub-
ject to express management’s functions in
hard and fast terms without the usual
embroidery of abstraction and general-
isation, W'hich for the most part is only so
much pseudo-scientific drivel?
It is almost as if many writers on the
subject are fearful of admitting the exis-
tence of scientific management lest such
a preciseness put an end to their verbose
speculations on what management is all
about.
One of the worst culprits in this re-
spect is assuredly Sir Walter Puckey,
whose UK publishers, Hutchinson & Co.,
have just sent his latest book “Organisa-
tion in Business Management” to Aus-
tralia. In this book, which is meant to
be a sort of primer for young managers
but to my mind only succeeds in confus-
ing a whole lot of issues, Sir Walter, as
in his earlier “Management Principles”
reviewed in The Bulletin last year, digs
more graves for management as a study
than he opens useful doors for it.
I have always been sceptical of the
efforts of management teachers like Sir
Walter and also business consultants
ploughing furrows for their subject,
and after reading this one I am more
suspicious than ever. What could be
more w'ishy-washy than the definition
Sir Walter accepts of Scientific Manage-
ment, which says “it means thinking
scientifically instead of traditionally or
customarily about the processes involved
in the control of social groups who co-
operate in production and distribution”.
TTow far from the everyday business of
management can you get? It is hardly
very encouraging for young managers to
learn from Sir Walter that although in-
dustry is taking a growing interest in the
study of scientific management, and al-
though “it is true that machines impose
a mental discipline which seems an essen-
tial requirement for those who wish to
think scientifically about management”,
neither of these two “industrial qualities”
has so far enabled us to provide an ade-
quate scientific foundation for better
management.
Further, “research into management
on a scale anything like research into
‘things’ has so far removed only the top
layers of scientific excavation, and it is
my view that management, like other
widespread and important developments,
must have a deeply dug scientific founda-
tion before a better structure rises into
common vision and use”.
One of Sir Walter’s biggest complaints
concerns the misunderstanding in indus-
try about who comprises “management”.
When so many subordinates in industry
say “we will see the management about
it” they are denigrating the term
“manager” which in his view should be
personalised at every opportunity.
“The depth of the management team in
most businesses is not a precise dimen-
sion and the statement just quoted is
often made by a subordinate because he
is not sure whether he is in the manage-
ment team himself. He may have been
told that as, say, a foreman, he is a man-
ager but circumstances compel him to
disbelieve it.”
course, in Australia the lower eche-
lon “managers” in the sense used by
Puckey have no great urge to be linked
with the “boss” classes, and this feeling
will die only very, very hard here. But
this is not to say that on the higher flights
of management here, as in Britain, to
become a director has been, and is in-
creasingly today, the ambition of many
managers even though, as Puckey says,
paradoxically director status may be hol-
low in terms of professional competence.
There are no exams for directors either
here or in the UK, many directors hold-
ing their directorships “solely on the
grounds of nepotism and other non-pro-
fessional reasons”. (Foi chapter and
verse for this country read “The 60
Families who Own Australia” by E W.
Campbell, published in August last year.)
Maybe we should have a look at (in
this country) what Puckey sees as “a
status gap near the top end of the pro-
motion ladder which managers are ex-
pected and hope to climb” in Britain. He
thinks the lack of professional standards
for directors there militates against the
more wholehearted acceptance of the
study of scientific management in that
country.
“Why,” many people ask, “is it neces-
sary to introduce higher professional
standards into management when the
next step upwards is into a realm where
professional standards are too often re-
garded as a disadvantage, or at least have
not so far been an essential qualifica-
tion?”
It is a good question, though I can’t
see much sense in Puckey’s answer to it.
This runs “the higher the professional
status of managers generally, the higher
the status of directors will become”.
One would have thought the two have
little to do with each other, and that the
solution might preferably be found in
shareholders of companies demanding
more exacting qualifications in the people
they elect to boards.
But I see precious few signs. of that
happening in this country where only a
small minority of directors are put up
by shareholders outside the interests
which in effect control companies (their
best chance of election has usually been
in times when a company’s affairs have
gone sour).
The fact remains that here, as in
Britain, directors as a whole pay only
lip service to the need for the study of
and research into scientific management,
whatever the cause of their general in-
difference. (This is not to belittle the
efforts of an enlightened minority of
directors who have succeeded not only
in getting summer schools of business
administration going, but also in estab-
lishing full-time courses at two of our
universities.)
T>uckey is, of course, one of the few en-
A lightened people in Britain seeking the
same ends, but he says he isn't optimistic
“about the greater acceptance of scientific
management among a sufficiently large
body of people. But we are living in
a world which more than ever before
requires better management and I am
convinced that there are many young
managers able and willing to catch the
mood and break down the barriers if
they are given reasonable guidance and
opportunity.”
Increasing numbers of young and old
managers in Australia have certainly
been catching on to the idea in recent
years, and the Australian Institute of
Management continues to whip them up.
I wish I could say that their study of
management will be greatly enhanced by
reading Sir Walter Puckey’s latest, but
really, I find it too fluffy for words.
J. C. HORSFALL
Profit Up, Div. Down
Otocks and Holdings Ltd has decided
to hold on to a greater proportion
of profits and has cut the dividend rate
from 20 to 15 p.c.
Earnings for the first half of the year
work out at an annual rate of 31.3 p.c.,
but directors consider it prudent to con-
serve funds for the increasing number
of projects on hand.
Directors say that cottage, home unit
and land sales were considerably greater,
and the housing and construction subsi-
diaries were working to capacity, thanks
to easier finance.
A yield of 5 p.c. is now available
from the market price of 15s.


New Trends in Packaging Industry
Increased costs are a danger
The Australian packaging indus-
try, following a setback in 1961-62
as a result of the credit squeeze,
appears now to have recovered
completely, and during its present
period of stability is anticipating a
high rate of growth.
The development of the industry
over the past ten years, with some
techniques borrowed from overseas,
some created here, has been re-
markable and Australia is becoming
a very packaging-conscious nation.
Over-capacity is a problem with
some companies in the field but not
all, and there was talk of narrow
profit margins when The Bulletin
interviewed executives last week.
An integral part of Australia’s manu-
facturing industries is packaging and
the companies involved seem to be
sharing in present prosperity.
Two companies have recently reported
higher sales and profit. Reed Paper Pro-
ducts (Holdings) Ltd’s directors say sales
and profit for the half-year were higher
than for the previous corresponding
period, and National Bag reports similar
good news. Vigorously competitive, com-
panies in the field plan expansions and
new developments.
Unfortunately, figures available from
the Commonwealth Statistician are only
as recent as 1961-62, but in nearly all
cases the value of materials used and the
packings manufactured has risen. It
could be assumed, not unreasonably, that
the rising trend has continued, but actual
statistical data for the year 1962-63 will
not be available until September.
For instance, the value of kraft wrap-
ping paper used rose from £12.2 million
in 1960-61 to £13.2 million in 1961-62.
The value of polythene sheet and film
rose from £740,958 to £901,215 in the
same period. The value of boxes and
cases rose from £4.1 million to £4.8
million and polythene bags and packets
from £3 million to £4 million.
On the other hand, the value of paper
bags and multiwall packets (the type used
for cement bags) fell from £3.7 million
in 1960-61 to £3.5 million in 1961-62.
The value of hessian bags fell from £1.2
million to £1 million.
Indications now are that the production
has stabilised and that all classes of
packaging are increasing in volume.
"jV/fR Lionel Abrahams, managing direc-
tor of National Bag Company of
Australia, said there was a marked trend
towards clear flexible packagings (such
as polythene film).
“People are becoming more and more
aware of the advantages of being able to
see what they’re buying, knowing it to
be hygienically packed, and having a
reasonably durable covering,” he said.
“Housewives in particular find the plastic
bag an advantage since it can be re-used.”
The company, with a ten acre site in
Sydney and 6i acres in both Brisbane
and Melbourne, is experiencing higher
sales and production compared with the
same period last year. Most sections of
the plant are working at full capacity.
National Bag manufactures cardboard
cartons, paper bags, multi-wall paper
sacks, polythene bags, hessian and calico
sacks. It also prints dress fabrics.
Mr Abrahams said National Bag used
some of its production for export but
declined to say how much or where it
went. “We are trying to expand our
exports and have been looking at a few
markets. We’ve met with some success
in our efforts.
“The future of the packaging industry
holds great promise. We are putting up
new buildings in three States and we
have just placed orders for nearly
£250,000 worth of new machinery to
cater for what we believe will be a rapidly
expanding market.
“Australia is developing a complete
personality of its own with regard to
packaging. We use overseas techniques
and buy our machinery outside Aus-
tralia, but styles and types of packaging
are purely local. What an American
would like, an Australian probably
wouldn't, so we cannot rely on overseas
companies for market trends.”
Despite rising costs of labor and
materials most companies have contained
the cost of their products and there has
not been a significant increase in price
for some years.
Increased production in nearly all in-
dustries has caused an increase in the
packaging industries’ output. A significant
increase in agriculture has meant a big
demand for sacking and sacks. Corre-
sponding increases in the non-durable
consumer goods industry has increased
orders for paper bags, sacks and card-
board cartons.
The announcement by the Sydney
City Council recently that it intends to
use paper bags instead of rubbish tins
has given the packaging industry’s future
a fillip. If the trial is successful the
Council may expand the system beyond
its test area and other councils could
follow suit.
The City Council’s decision follows a
visit by four of its aldermen to the Mel-
bourne suburb of Springvale where 314
homes have been using the paper bag
system for a trial period of 12 months.
South Perth Shire in Western Australia
has also been Y using the system and
several Sydney councils are interested in
testing it. It has been used successfully
in England, Europe, America and New
Zealand.
The approximate cost of the bag is
Bd. to Is. and with 2,817,270 dwellings
(at the 1961 census) in Australia, each
of which would require an average of
two bags per week, the interest that paper
bag manufacturers are showing is not
surprising. If the system were adopted
nationwide the manufacturers would have
to supply approximately £234,772 worth
of paper bags each week.
National Bag has already prepared
pamphlets explaining its “Wastebag Gar-
bag” garbage system and, if the system
is introduced, plans to sell both the bags
and the metal holders to councils.
4V/S"R Derek Hill, managing director of
Reed Paper Products Ltd, said the
market in Australia for packaging was
expanding at about 7 p.c. a year. The
market for packaging had grown from
£65 million in 1950-51 to £144 million
in 1960-61. He believed that the market
for packaging would continue to expand
faster than the economy generally.
“We have to watch very carefully the
trends in demand,” he said, “because
some sectors of the economy are moving
forward at a faster rate than others.
Multiwall sacks are an instance the
prospect in growth there is at present
about three to five p.c. But if there is
a change to the paper rubbish bags the
demand for them could be greater than
all the other uses put together.
“There is evidence that in the last six
months there has been a greater expan-
sion in the packaging industry. I think
the sudden expansion has been due
mainly to the complete recovery from
the 1960-61 credit squeeze.”
Reed has branches in Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, Launceston, Newcastle
and Brisbane. Its activities cover corru-
gated cartons, cigarette-type packet manu-
facture and paper bags and sacks. It
does not make any packages from poly-
thene film.
Mr Hill said because of the upsurge
in demand Reed expected its year’s
results to be better than the previous
year’s. He would continue to get results
outlined in the company’s interim reports.


“In volume of sales,” he explained,
“corrugated cartons are our biggest single
item. We are the largest manufacturers
of paper bags in Australia and we only
manufacture the cigarette pack-type of
packets in our Sydney works. The pros-
pects in cigarette packets are good, but
there has been a lot of marginal pricing
in this field which has led to a reduction
in profitability.
“The carton industry has been pricing
its products far too finely and is now
faced with the prospect of increasing
costs. These costs will apply through-
out the industry.”
Mr Hill’s remarks apparently fore-
shadow an increase in packaging prices,
probably a significant one and the first
for years.
“We are faced with a wage increase
and we have already had to cater
for three weeks’ annual leave”,
he said, “the general trend .in.
wages is rising and will continue
to rise.
“Raw material prices have
risen, in the case of paper bags
by more than 6to 7 p.c. The
price of bags has remained
relatively steady, but while
APPM has been doing a great
job, if wages go up one doubts
whether the company will be
able to hold its prices.
“In the last three years there
has been a significant reduction
in the price of packaging, but
it looks as though it won't con-
tinue. This has been due to
excess capacity in the industry—manu-
facturers have been chasing after not
enough orders. The position is pretty well
stabilised now and I doubt if there is
any excess capacity at this moment.”
Mr Hill said Reed exported to the
Pacific Islands but he could not release
precise details of a proposed venture.
“Suffice it to say, we are keeping in mind
the necessity to manufacture in the
islands to meet future demand,” he went
on.
“We are very active at the moment in
trying to increase exports to the Pacific
Islands. One of our salesmen has just
returned from there with some handy
orders. We will be able to supply Fiji
with items they have, until now, been
importing from Holland, Canada and
Czechoslovakia. We haven’t got any
firm plans for exporting to South-east
Asia, but if the opportunities and market
are right we would consider it.
“Another item which is exported,
although it is not intended specifically
for export, is playing cards. We make
quite a lot of them with Australian motifs
and designs which people take overseas
with them or send as souvenirs.”
Australia is tending more and more to
the American idea of unit packaging.
This has stemmed from the supermarket-
type retailing where the person wants
to see what he is buying, either through
clear windows or on the outside of
packages. Unit packaging also enables
the purchaser to buy exactly the amount
he wants and no more or less.
This has been going on since the war
and has reached a very highly advanced
stage in Europe, England and America.
“It is pretty advanced in Australia
now but pressures to use this type of
packaging have not been as great here
as they have been overseas,” said Mr
Hill.
“This has also called for packages to
be designed to give protection to the
contents of the package and prevent
deterioration and wastage. They must
be designed to give maximum protection
whether you are packing flour or deter-
gent, motor parts or cigarettes, to make
sure the product arrives in marketable
condition.
“Television has brought about a lot of
these changes in packaging. The manu-
facturer has to display his product to
best advantage both on the screen and
on the shelf. There is also a trend towards
using color photographs of the product
on the outside of the packet to give the
buyer some idea of what it looks like.
“Of course, it may not always turn
out exactly as the packet shows it, but
it definitely does help sell. The packaging
of breakfast foods is rapidly becoming
similar throughout the world.
“And Australians have begun to expect
a certain level of packaging with the
products they buy. The quality of the
package should reflect the quality of the
product. This is most important to
cultivate the customer's return for more.
“Another development in the packag-
ing industry is the crash lock-bottomed
carton. It automatically seals itself when
the sides of the package in the flat are
pushed towards each other to make a
square container.
“The future of the industry is very
sound and, providing costs do not in-
crease too much, it will continue to
grow,” Mr Hill added.
Mr A. White, managing director of
Australian Sisalkraft and Bates (Aus-
tralasia), which is partly owned by F. W.
Williams Holdings Ltd, said his com-
pany’s sales were up “by a reasonable
percentage”. He said the Australian
packaging industry, like most other in-
dustries, had over - capacity over-
capacity in that they were not using
their equipment to full advantage.
“Surplus capacity in the industry has
been caused by too many entrants into
the field and too much equipment.
Because of this some companies have
reduced quality to offset the competitive
pricing.
“In the last five years there
has been an increasing number
of people getting into the
packaging business, and they
have consequently increased
capacity,” Mr White said.
“In the next five or ten years
there will be improvements in
packaging itself. The trend will
be to greater use of new
materials, and there will be more
rapid changes in forms of
packaging.
“A notable development has
been in the packaging of biscuits.
First they came in tins, then in
cellulose film which, although
it protected them slightly better
than the tins, still allowed
moisture to enter. Then came the
laminate—cellulose film coated with a
polyethylene film which offered greater
protection.
“Many products which are subject
to deterioration by moisture vapor are
now being packed in polyethylene film.
Other laminates, such as paper and foil,
film and paper, are becoming increas-
ingly popular with manufacturers be-
cause of the protection they offer. And
there is going to be continual searching
for ways to improve this and other types
of packaging.
“This is directly associated with a
growing trend to prepackaging, or unit
packaging. We are seeing developments
such as one in America where motor oil,
instead of being packed in cans, is being
packed in a spirally wound laminate of
tin foil and cardboard. It's cheaper than
the can. Another smilar trend is towards
milk being packed in polyethylene coated
cart ons rather than bottles.”
Mr White said the cost of packaging
over the last five years had decreased
because of improved techniques. If there
has been any increase it has not been
really significant.
“There have been upward movements
in some segments of the industry but

these have been offset by reduced costs
in other sections,” said Mr White. “This
has been due partly to improvements in
packaging rather than many basic in-
creases in material costs. Prices in the
industry have been fairly static.
“There is a delicate balance between
cost of production and sale price, due
to surplus capacity and over-com-
petition.”
The opinion of some executives was
that competition was going to force
some companies to the wall, but not
those who make a quality product at a
commensurate price.
Mr White said the industry would face
competition in the future from three
sources: the small company which enters
the field with know-how or patents, the
company which switched from buying
packaging outside to making its own,
and the foreign company which bought
an existing company.
“I can’t see too many new packaging
companies starting up in Australia with
Australian capital, but the packaging in-
dustry will continue to grow because
people are going to demand better
packaging. The whole question of the
profitability of packaging companies I
feel is tied up with the management —-
it is the only variable in the industry
which must buy at the same price and
pay the same award rate as its com-
petitors.”
Footwear Firm Steps Ahead
'C'xtinction of accumulated losses this
year means International Footwear
Industries Ltd has to earn a higher gross
to equal last year’s 37.7 p.c. earning rate.
In the first half of the year the com-
pany has reported that sales were higher
and profits comparable with the previous
corresponding period.
A £300,000 long-term loan was ar-
ranged to assist development. At last
balance date (June 30) the company
already had £330,000 odd in loan capital,
as against £405,852 in share capital.
The ss. shares currently yield 6 p.c.,
from the market price of 10s. 4d.
Tasty Cheese
Shareholders in Melbourne’s Italiano
Cheese Industries must be smiling
as they think of the possibilities of an-
other dividend increase this year. The
company, which makes Continental-type
cheeses, lifted profit in the December
half-year. The actual rate of increase
was not given.
Local sales rose 10 p.c. but export
sales showed “significant expansion”. In
fact, the increased overseas market has
prompted directors to see that trips
abroad are introduced soon to explore
the possibilities in various countries.


Stealing a Mach on Britain
UK aircraft industry hit by American challenge
CONCORDE-1966?
BOEING 733-1967?
From ANDREW WILSON in London
TTas the British aircraft industry a
future? Is there a market for it?
Is it taking a nosedive to disaster by
trying to compete with America in pro-
jects for which it lacks the means?
Recent blows to the prestige of the in-
dustry have given these questions a
new urgency.
Two weeks ago Mr Thorneycroft an-
nounced that an American aircraft, the
McDonnell Phantom, had been chosen
for the Royal Navy. At the 'same time
he told the Commons that an American
helicopter would be bought for the
Army’s brushfire war requirements.
In November, amid bitter exchanges,
an American supersonic strike aircraft,
the TFX (which has not yet been built)
was chosen by Australia in preference
to the much-advertised British TSR 2.
Two months later it emerged that
the de Havilland Trident had lost to
the American Boeing 727 in its
strenuous battle for the Japanese airline
market.
But this is not all. Next month the
United States Federal Aviation Agency
is due to announce its choice of a Super-
sonic Transport design to compete with
the Anglo-French Concorde.
The Concorde is still likely to be a
year or two ahead of the American
SST, with a prototype flying in 1966.
But last weekend President Johnson dis-
closed that America had a 2000 miles
per hour military jet, the A-11. The
A-11 is certainly not a prototype for an
SST, but it will provide American SST
designers with important information
about Mach 3 flying which was not yet
thought possible. (Mach 1 is the speed
of sound.)
The Concorde will be built of alumin-
ium and, to avoid over-heating
through surface friction, will be given a
speed of Mach 2.2 (about 1450 miles
an hour). Its economic range will be
about 3700 miles the flight route
between London or Paris and New
York. It will not fly Frankfurt-New
York or Rome-New York, and is there-
fore unacceptable to German and
Italian airlines.
The American SST will be built of
steel or titanium and have greater
range at speeds up to Mach 2.8 (about
1800 miles an hour). Ultimately—and
this is the point being heavily stressed
in America it will be capable of
development to greater speeds and pay-
loads. This costs money a possible
development bill of £.300 million and
a selling price of £9 million per air-
craft according to current American
estimates.
It is, of course, possible that the
Concorde and the SST will be com-
plementary and that the Concorde will
establish itself before the American air-
craft arrives. But no airline wants to
incur the expense of running a mixed
fleet.
Lower down the scale the British Air-
craft Corporation is turning out the
VC 10, which goes into service with
BOAC next month. The VC 10 is a
comfortable, silent jet in which you can
balance a sixpence on the edge of a
martini glass. When more is known
about recent crashes involving jets with
under-wing engines, the VC 10 with its
tail-mounted engines may be shown to
enjoy an unadvertised safety factor.
"Out nobody is excited about its intro-
duction—least of all BOAC, whose
pilots prefer the Boeing 707 and whose
board faces a £250,000 bill to cover
the cost of bringing each new VC 10
into service. Nor are limited sales to
Commonwealth airlines likely to show
a final profit on the VC 10’s production.
While some failures of the British
aircraft industry have been brilliant
projects poorly exploited, others are the
simple result of out-of-date thinking—■
such as the initiative which went to
developing the Britannia, a giant four-
engined turbo-prop, when the turbo-
prop age was quickly giving way to the
jet.
But civil aircraft are only part of the
story. More than 60 p.c. of the British
aircraft industry is engaged on military
work, with lucrative export markets in
Latin America and Asia. And it is in
military aviation that the British in-
dustry now faces its greatest difficulties.
In the past the industry’s spokesman,
the Society of British Aircraft Con-
structors, has bitterly criticised the
Government for erratic changes in
defence policy and specifications for
weapons systems. But as aircraft be-
come more sophisticated and costly the
problem appears more and more simply
as the difference in the military market
which enables the Americans to prepare
a production line of nearly 2000 for
the TFX, compared with a possible 120
for the TSR 2.
With the United States manufacturers
enjoying the benefit of such a large
home market, the prospects of British
industry look thin. Some pessimists
foresee the day when it may withdraw
from the manufacture of aircraft alto-
gether and turn to making engines and
components for American airframes.
/Certainly it makes military and com-
mercial nonsense to order aircraft
and tailor military requirements not to
the needs of strategy or profitable air-
line operations but in order to stave off
unemployment in Bristol or Belfast.
But, in fact, the major non-American
successes in the world civil aviation
market have been by modest aircraft:
the Vickers Viscount and the- Fokker
Friendship.
The next success is likely to be won
by Britain’s short-haul jet, the BAC
111, which is already on order by three
major airlines in America alone. I
asked the technical vice-president of a
leading American airline why he had
chosen the BAC 111. He said simply
that the makers had studied all his re-
quirements and he couldn’t afford to
wait for American industry to catch
up with it.
Many Americans, and a number of
British aircraft specialists, believe that
Britain should concentrate on the short-
haul field and make a break-through.
Certainly the demand for short-haul
aircraft is growing almost weekly as
new “feeder” airlines come into service
to feed the big jets. Subsonic jets are
also expected to provide more than
two-thirds of the world’s market after
the introduction of the SST—assuming
the SST can overcome the great safety
and technical hazards which remain to
be solved in supersonic passenger flight.

MARKET POINTERS
Look Before You Buy
A s suggested last week, when writing
before the market fall, it’s a tough
proposition trying to pick stocks when
the market is notching new peaks. For
those who insist on investing at such
times, a good plan to use might be the
“comparative” technique. In other words,
some shares are better buying now than
they were recently.
The trap here, of course, is that the
stocks which suddenly fall out of favor,
because of poor results, could fall further.
★ ★ ★
'll7’hen Wall Street reached a new
" all-time high last week it was 21 p.c.
above the figure of a year ago. The recent
peak established by the Sydney ordinary
share price index was 24 p.c. higher
than a year ago. But both Stock Ex-
changes were topped by West Germany
which, in the same period, rose by
30 p.c.
The three Exchanges were well in
advance of other prominent world Stock
Exchanges, with Canada the next-best
performer with a 16 p.c. rise over the
year.
★ ★ ★
Ohakeouts in the share market usually
provide the opportunity to pick up
shares previously considered too dear.
David Jones and Myer Emporium
have achieved a remarkable record
in the retail business and the
recent low market yields of 2.7 p.c. and
2.2 p.c. are the penalty of success.
To those who believe Australia’s ex-
pansion will continue steadily in the next
few years, these two stocks, although
looking very high in price, stand to bene-
fit from general economic growth.
The market downturn already has
shaved a little from recent high prices
and the long-term holder could console
himself by taking advantage of any
slackening.
These are lock-away propositions, of
course, and the time to buy them was
during the depressed markets of 1961
and 1962.

fpuNGSTEN prices, after rising on the
London metals market from 75 5.
sterling last October to around 115 s.
sterling a ton in February, slid back again
in March to a range of 90s. to 955. when
producers (including some in the Com-
munist bloc ) took advantage of the
higher levels.
This steel-hardening metal, used for
tool tips and other special purposes, was
in the doldrums last year when more
than a third of the market was being
supplied by low-cost mines in China,
North Korea and Russia. Demand has
strengthened, however, and costs are
creeping up, even for the Communist
bloc.
★ ★ ★
A consideration for Australian pro-
'*"*• ducer King Island Scheelite is
that supplies are interrupted in war-
time. The Korean war, for example,
caused the price to skyrocket.
With this in mind, some of the specu-
lators will be keeping a close eye on
King Island Scheelite shares at around
10s.
★ ★ ★
'VToting that North Broken Hill has
' come down from around 39 5. to 32 5.
this stock possibly could qualify as a
“comparative” buy.
Those who studied the strong, sustain-
ed surge in base metal stocks in the past
year, however, might feel that it is tempt-
ing fate. But “ Norths” has proved itself
as a stock for the long-term and its un-
doubted reserves and internal strength
have justified its inclusion in many a
portfolio.
More than a few optimists were pur-
chasing six months’ options on “Norths”
at levels of around 375. and 38s. a month
or two ago. So purchasers at around
325. or less will be that much better off
than the stock buyers.
From Rubber to Coffee
TT'oitaki Para Rubber Estates Ltd
has bought a producing coffee
plantation in the New Guinea High-
lands, which directors consider has de-
velopment potential.
Rubber prices are lower so that al-
though production was greater in the
first half of the year to June 30, 1964,
the company had to draw on reserves
to continue last year’s increased divi-
dend of 25 p.c.
At 16s. 1 Id., compared with last year’s
price range from 17s. 6d. to 11s. 9d.,
the shares look rather vulnerable.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Investment Advice in Volumes
Brokers provide choice of hardy annuals
Tnvestors need never complain about
A any shortage of printed material to
help (or hinder) them in their task of
share selection. Brokers in particular
continue to produce a veritable flood of
monthly newsletters and hints for special
occasions.
Around this time of the year, too, it
has become natural to look for a few
traditional, more comprehensive annual
reviews surveying a large collection of
companies and summarising market per-
formances.
Much of the information contained
therein is just a convenient rehash of
balance-sheet and Stock Exchange re-
search detail. The would-be speculator
must still largely make up his own mind
on the value of all this retrospective
analysis.
Perhaps these reviews are short on
urging the very necessary alliance between
pure investment results, the quality of
company management and the state of
the outside economy. Investors should
be on their guard to obtain some back-
ground on the two latter crucial points.
The combination might then lead them
to understand, without panic, such
features as the current and almost
historical March market drift. Under
present economic circumstances there’s
no necessity to thrust upon a semi-
seasonal index retreat the additional
burden of overall weakness.
After all, Ord, Minnett’s “Australian
Equities” did furnish a just summary of
1964 prospects: “The probability of a
rise of about 15 p.c. in corporate profits
after tax during the current financial year
suggests that there is scope for apprecia-
tion in the market as a whole in 1964.
It seems likely, too, that this favorable
trend in company earnings will be accom-
panied by a resumption of activity in new
issues to the public, particularly as finan-
cial institutions have provided private
fixed interest finance on a very substan-
tial scale in the past few months.”
The ordinary investor may then find
that King and Yuill’s “Investment Re-
view,” taking in 228 Australian com-
panies, contains a less sophisticated style
of individual analysis than the above-
mentioned Ord volume. It is especially
clear and straightforward on capital
growth and income improvement.
These two tests are applied over the
five-year, 1958-1963 period. Curiously
enough, the highest capital gains have
been displayed by a group of good quality
stocks which almost subjectively were
awarded continuous market approval.
The well-known names include Roth-
mans, Amalgamated Chemicals, John
Fairfax, Publishers Holdings, Big Sister,
Mount Isa, Television Corporation,
Allied Mills, James Hardie and Life
Savers. Actually Lend Lease led the
bunch, though its present market position
is reacting to specific circumstances.
The industry groupings which head
capital gains are: (1) Food, drink and
tobacco; (2) banks, insurance, trustee; (3)
retail trade and services; (4) building
materials and construction. Not sur-
prisingly, retailers finish second on in-
come improvement as well, the winner
here being fuel, light and power.
HCS Still Consolidating ?
T ast October, the chairman of H. C.
Sleigh described the company’s
1962-63 year as one of “consolidation”.
He pointed out that large sums had been
invested in new projects which were
suffering from a natural delay in reach-
ing profitability.
The latest interim report for the six
months to December 31, shows not only
that these projects are apparently still
ailing, but, perhaps more importantly,
that the normal operations of the group
are also suffering from inadequate profit-
ability.
Profit before tax was “considerably
reduced” from £1,622,000 to
£1,317,000. This was despite a 12 p.c.
rise in the sale of petroleum products,
a 20 p.c. sales rise in tyres and other
rubber products, and higher sales in the
export sector. Profit from petroleum
products actually dropped because of
extra and keener competition, while
export profit margins were reduced by
the same factor. Fortunately, rubber
activities produced an improved result.
Judging by these reports, it may well
be that the group has expanded to the
stage which economists call “diminishing
returns”.
Nevertheless, directors anticipate that
earnings will be more than sufficient to
cover the 12i p.c. dividend for the ninth
year in succession. They say that petro-
leum and rubber products sales are still
rising, the former at a rate which will
maintain the present lower profitability,
while export earnings are expected to
increase as a result of new contracts and
other negotiations.
In addition, the Dominion Line ship-
ping service to Japan is expected to show
profits “soon”. The cost of establishing
this line (one of those projects which
have been “consolidating”) affected the
half-year’s earnings, but more passengers
and improved cargo earnings are ex-
pected.
Another “consolidating” investment is
the new refinery at Kurnell, which is
expected to be on stream some time this
month.
All in all, it looks like these new pro-
jects will be needed (if they prove success-
ful) to help pull the earning rate out of
the nose-dive it has been in for some
years despite rising profits. Back in 1957
it was 32.7 p.c., and after touching a
low of 14 p.c. in 1961, it was 15.8 p.c.
last year.
Directors are obviously very conscious
of this poor record, which probably ex-
plains why they are currently arranging
for a private placement of £1! million
in unsecured notes to finance further
expansion
No Moans from Myers
YlfiTH some relief we find a company
that is not moaning about increased
costs, higher wages, intense competition,
etc., etc. In fact, Melbourne’s Myer Em-
porium reports an “improved” net profit
for the six months to January 31 through
a “careful control over expenses.”
Sales rose only 6 p.c. during the
period, compared with 10 p.c. in the full
1963 year and 17 p.c. in 1962. This effort
is not as weak as it appears at first glance.
Australian retail sales gained only 5 p.c.
in the samb period. Moreover, no new
outlets were added whereas the 1963
result was boosted by new stores at
Gordon (NSW) and Toowoomba (Qld)
and the 1962 figure by the acquisition of
Farmer’s and Western Stores.
On this evidence, it is reasonable to
expect a better than 6 p.c. sales increase
for the full year because of a new outlet,
the Miranda Fair shopping centre, in
Sydney.
Even if this centre adds nothing to the
“improved” result so far, shareholders
can expect earning rate to show a small
increase over last year’s splendid 31.4 p.c.
They may even hope for an increased
dividend as this figure abundantly cover-
ed the 16f p.c. dividend.
Mover Settles Down
/"Ine of Victoria’s large furniture re-
movalists, Wridgway Auburn Hold-
ing, has at last settled down to a success-
ful trading basis, and will soon be
operating in all States. Its activities
include general transport and storage
facilities.
The 1962 maiden year on the SE lists
returned shareholders only a 4 p.c. divi-
dend. But last year profit recovered to
earn 17.3 p.c. on capital and the pay-

out was lifted to 10 p.c. A one-for-one
par issue was made to finance expansion.
This expansion is apparently proving
successful as the half-year’s trading pro-
duced an “appreciable” profit rise after
a 15 p.c. sales increase. According to
directors this trend is continuing in the
current six months.
Under these prosperous conditions, the
group has expanded rapidly. Last year
new stores were finished at Queanbeyan,
Bankstown and Perth, while agencies
were established in Mt. Isa and Alice
Springs. Further extensions have been
made or are being planned in Brisbane,
Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra as de-
mand increases.
Expansion like this makes a constant
call on liquid funds and, as the 1964
earning rate will at least be maintained
on the increased capital, shareholders
may benefit from another cash issue.
Tancred Topheavy
HThe rise in profit of Tancred Brothers
A Industries Ltd for the year to June,
1963, from £129,875 to £217,440
was evidently a freak performance.
Profit for the latest six months to
December is reported as “substantially
reduced”, although turnover showed
“satisfactory increase”.
Tancred echoes Conkey and F. J.
Walker that trading conditions in the
meat industry are increasingly difficult,
but Tancred says it louder. Higher
livestock values are the chief sources of
trouble.
Perhaps it' was too much to expect
Tancred to maintain its phenomenal
earning rate of last year (51.2 p.c.), but
many shareholders who held tight last
week when the ss. shares hit 225. are
going to be disappointed.
The 15 p.c. dividend rate is not in
danger, and the price has settled to a
more reasonable 19s.
More Generous Handout
T7ormulator and distributor of agri-
A cultural chemicals, Amalgamated
Chemicals Ltd, feels a higher dividend
is warranted although net trading pro-
fit in the year to December 31 actually
receded.
The tax provision was increased from
£245,785 to £268,235 and deprecia-
tion from £64,386 to £82,014, while
the profit fell from £495,721 to
£445,300. An additional capital pro-
fit of £59,080 was made from the sale
of investments (1962 £12,781).
Capital was increased by issues to
shareholders (one-for-four at 2s. 6d.
premium), to Kiwi Polish for takeover
of Parco Chemicals Pty, and to direc-
tors to cancel profit-sharing contracts.
Several small plants belonging to the
many members of the group have been
closed down, and production facilities
centralised. This involved heavy ex-
penses in 1963-64.
Directors must consider this expen-
sive period is over to recommend the
dividend increase from 12} to 13i p.c.,
when earning rate slid from 30.2 to
22.8 p.c.
The market let the ss. shares fall be-
low 16s. (15s. 3d. in Melbourne), which
must represent exceptional value in
these days of low returns.
At 16s. a purchase renders an income
return of 4.3 p.c., and an earnings yield
of 7.1 p.c. From the particulars given
to the general public, there seems no
reason for the present scepticism.
Agricultural chemicals is a continu-
ously developing industry, and produ-
cers of sugar, wool, meat and wheat
are all enjoying good seasons and buoy-
ant prices.
Country TV on the Move
Tt was pointed out in The Bulletin
A of January 11 that many country
television stations could be joining the
dividend lists this year. First evidence
of this cropped up last week in an in-
terim report from Goulburn-Murray
Television, operator of GMV6 North-
ern Victoria.
Profit in the half was £24,805, com-
pared with £3989 in the full 1962-63
year. Evidence that operations were
becoming fully established was reflected
in the advertising revenue which rose
57 p.c. above the figure for the first
half of that year.
However, a payout to shareholders
may be deferred until 1965 because
directors are planning to spend
£32,000 on a videotape recorder to
be installed in April.
But this does not alter the fact that
earnings could support a dividend this
year. On the other hand, directors
would be following a sound policy if
the machine was financed from net pro-
fit. It will help boost results no end
in the 1965 year and internal financing,
while reducing the possibility of a 1964
dividend, ensures that creditors and in-
terest charges will not reduce the 1965
result.
Freedom from such burdens could,
in fact, produce earnings which will
cover a much higher dividend than
that which would be safely covered this
year.
Ten-Pin Bowling Slump
A disappointing public response in the
summer months brought profit of
Newcastle Ten-Pin Bowling Ltd down
from £16,337 in the six months to
December, 1962, to £4353 in the simi-
lar period for 1963. The company is
therefore omitting interim dividend.

Prospectus forecast a 10 p.c. annual
dividend. This was fulfilled in the nine
months of 1961-62 when a 7+ p.c. was
paid, but last year shareholders got
only an interim 5 p.c.

A Hand in the Biscuit Tin
loss of £52,000 by Nabisco Pty
• Ltd in the year to November 30
could just manage to renew the Ameri-
can parent’s interest in the Australian
biscuit market. Nabisco is one of our
largest manufacturers of breakfast
foods and it is controlled by the
National Biscuit Co. of New York.
The better known lines include Vita-
Brits and Weeties. As well as break-
fast foods the company also handles
macaroni, McLintock’s jellies, Turban
coffee essence and Wundawax floor
polish.
The American group’s interest in our
£3O million a year (wholesale value)
biscuit market w ; as first revealed last
June when Arnotts and Brockhoffs
merged into the Australian Biscuit Co.
Pty Ltd, as a defence against takeover
from overseas as w 7 ell as for economic
reasons. National was believed to be
looking over the three major groups, the
third being Swallow 7 & Ariell.
The dominant Arnotts would not
have welcomed a takeover of the
smaller Brockhoffs by the US giant any
more than Brockhoffs would have wel-
comed the reverse situation. Their
merger gave them 70 p.c. of the market
and apparently scared off National.
This left only Swallows who held
around 8 to 9 p.c. National w'as pro-
bably rather uncertain of any move
here as this small percentage could go
even lower once the merged company
really gets under way. On top of this,
Peak Frean (UK owned) and George
Weston (Canadian owned) had not done
particularly brilliantly in nibbling under
10 p.c. each of the biscuit market.
However, rather than have Australian
operations running at a loss, the US
company could easily be reconsidering
a lash at the market. Swallows must
still be interesting bait and there are
many small private firms which could
be used to get a hand in the biscuit tin.
Short-term View on ARI
Shareholders of Associated Rural
lndustries Ltd must be stout-
hearted. They have been fairly w'arned
by directors that a loss is anticipated
for 1963-64, although profit in the first
half showed considerable improvement.
Last year to June, earnings were only
0.8 p.c. on capital, and the 8 p.c. divi-
dend was paid from reserves, as this
year's will be, too.
The reasons given for this year’s ex-
pected loss are a change in shearing
dates so that only six months’ growth
of wool will be available for sale, heavy
depreciation being taken into account,
and tax-deductible improvements being
written off.
The carrot for shareholders this time
is that the Thursday Island cultured
pearl project is ahead of schedule, and
a substantial profit is expected in 1964-
65 and subsequent years.
The Kimberley grazing and agricul-
tural projects operated profitably in the
December six months.
Certain investors can be patient with
a company w 7 hich keeps paying divi-
dends w'hile showing only nominal pro-
fits, but that company must show pro-
fits to lure fresh capital.
Associated Rural had over £BOO,OOO
from the sale of Parsons Foods Pty to
General Food Corporation in 1961,
which it has invested in the Kimber-
leys and in pearling. Last year’s ba-
lance sheet showed an increase in liabi-
lities, so shareholders hope that the
years of heavy capital expenditure are
over.
The ss. shares continue to hang 6d.
or so below par, and nobody can blame
investors for taking the short-term
view.
No Rock of Gibraltar
Tnvestors are still regarding Victorian
quarrying shares somewhat warily.
Despite the flood of optimistic interim
reports from the group, prices have
moved only fractionally as if to reflect
disbelief in the apparent solidarity of

In fact, the difficulty in measuring
the permanence of the recovery from
last year's heavy comebacks is the exact
reason why the shares have not risen in
accordance with what one would expect
after such a buoyant half-year of oper-
ations.
Investors are obviously waiting for
the full year’s results before taking

prices drastically up or down. And
they cannot be blamed for this attitude.
Although most interim reports talked of
big sales gains, many showed caution
when discussing profit margins. This
caution turned rapidly to vagueness
once predictions on the current half-
year were brought to the fore.
Another dampening factor is the
general belief that the quarriers, as a
whole, produce more metal than Vic-
toria needs at present. This is true, but
precisely how over-supplied the market
is provides a controversial point.
Judging by the keen competition be-
tween the companies, one could safely
assume that the over-supply situation is
serious. Earthworks and Quarries re-
cently found it necessary to sell or lease
all its quarrying land and plant to Con-
solidated Quarries. Undoubtedly Con-
solidated will make better use of these
facilities than Earthworks managed to,
but this will only add more metal to the
market.
All this uncertainty as to the future
is sufficient reason for holding share
prices back at present. But in addition
investors can still recall the disturbances
of last year.
Expansion had been too fast and, in
an attempt at rationalisation, the quar-
ries tried to fix prices. The scheme
blew up in their face. A great hue and
cry arose from many quarters. Some
local councils actually awoke from their
slumbers and threatened to establish
their own quarries. Even Mr Bolte
came to the party by launching an in-
quiry into the industry.
In the end, conditions stayed as they
were. A slight rise in prices and the
buoyant building industry were the
main reasons for the prosperous half-
year but what will happen to results
once this cycle passes and competition
moves to an even keener basis?
The Good Seed
Shareholders of Andersons Seeds
Etd were advised in December last
year that negotiations were under way
which could materially advance future
trading results.
This now turns out to be an alliance
with the London based Australian
Estates Co. Ltd, whereby that company
subscribes for 110,000 ss. shares at a
premium, and advances funds on attrac-
tive terms for Andersons’ expansion.
Andersons recently made a one-for-
two par issue, the first since 1949. To-
gether with the issue to Australian-
Estates, Andersons should have about
£lOO,OOO for development purposes.
Towards the end of last year, the
company issued 80,800 ss. shares at a
premium of 2s. 6d. as part payment for
the acquisition of Duranbah Pastoral
Co. Pty Ltd and its subsidiary Terra-
nova Tropical Pastures Pty.
Australian Estates will act as special
distributor in Queensland and Victoria
for Andersons products, and is now a
preferred distributor of Terranova sub-
tropical and tropical seeds and for agri-
cultural seeds generally.
Andersons’ shares leaped Is. 6d. to
10s. when the market heard of the liai-
son. The company has been public for
30 years but at last balance date its
capital was only £102,500 and profit
£17,064.
Issues announced have brought paid
capital to £211,550, and focused at-
tention on the business.
Australian Estates, whose shares are
listed only in London, has a paid capi-
tal of almost £stg2.6 million, and at
December 31, 1962, had investments
approaching £stgl.9 million. The
association promotes Andersons in
public favor.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Pastoral Leaders Compared
At present prices Dalgety's seems more attractive than Elder’s
Tust as we have seen a considerable
" revival of interest in bank shares, so
we have seen a revival of more recent
origin in the shares of the pastoral
finance companies. Even so, the rise in
the price of Elder Smith Goldsbrough
Mort Ltd shares seems to have been
much greater than the others and with
a current dividend yield of 3.5 p.c. from
a price around 275. 9d. we must look for
other factors apart from the improve-
ment in wool prices.
While the shares of UK-based com-
panies are always rather less attractive
to Australian investors, it seems at first
glance that Dalgety's shares, which show
a yield of 4.4 p.c. on current prices of
around 645., should be a rather better
buy than Elder’s shares. Elder’s activities
are confined to the Australian continent,
while Dalgety’s cover New Zealand and
South Africa as well.
During 1962-63 Elder’s sold 1,339,207
bales of Australian wool and Dalgety’s
1,109,105, but Dalgety's also sold
360,171 bales of New Zealand wool.
Other activities seem very similar but,
following the merger. Elder's is rather
more deeply committed in the running
of properties than is Dalgety's.
From the point of view of size, Elder’s
plans to have 276 country branches and
sub-branches, whereas Dalgety’s had 268
branches, sub-branches and representa-
tives (excluding 12 controlling and
regional branches) in Australia with an-
other 107 branches and sub-branches and
40 agencies in New Zealand.
Putting the last consolidated balance
sheets side by side the picture is as
follows:
Elder's (£Amillion) Dalgety's
Current assets 45.7 63.5
Current liabilities 31.2 34.3
Net working capital 14.5 29.2
Fixed assets 12.4 22.5
Investments 6.7 1.4
33.6 53.1
Loan capital 5.7 21.1
Minority interests 0.2
Pref. capital 4.1
Ordinary capital 12.0 11.8
Reserves 15.9 15.9
figures indicate that with a slight-
ly smaller ordinary capital Dalgety’s
are controlling nearly 60 p.c. more assets,
while the net current assets are more than
100 p.c. greater. Naturally, Dalgety’s is
more highly geared.
Looking at the last profit statements,
we find that a direct comparison cannot
be made since the accounts of Elder’s
include 15 months’ profit for the Golds-
brough group, but guessing at the profit
of Goldsbrough for the three months
from March 31, 1963, to June 30, 1963,
it should have been said that the earn-
ings of Dalgety's were between 20 p.c.
and 25 p.c. greater than Elder's.
With a view to deciding whether or not
the past record of Elder’s warrants the
present yield of 3.5 p.c. it may be in-
structive to consider the position of am
investor who on the last day of January,
1955, purchased 400 Elder Smith & Co.
shares and 250 Goldsbrough Mort shares
at an approximate total cost of £lO7O.
Prior to the amalgamation he would have
received rights issues on the following
dates and bases:—
Company Books close date Details
Elder Smith 2/2/1955. 3 for 5 @lB/-
(par 12/-)
Goldsbrough Mort 15/2/1957 1 for 5 @ par
20/-
If he had maintained a constant invest-
ment by selling his rights and purchasing
old shares, by the time amalgamation
was completed he would have held 1263
shares in Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort
which today would be worth approxi-
mately £1768. This represents, on
average, a capital appreciation rate, of
about 5 p.c. compound over the nine
years.
record of dividend income is not
such a happy one, although it must be
admitted that, with the proposed increase
in the rate to 10 p.c. for the 1963-64
year, the 1964 dividend income will be
23 p.c. higher than the 1955 dividend
income. Unfortunately, this annual
income has fluctuated fairly markedly
and the index (using the 1955 year as a
base = 100) is as follows:
Dividend Wool Prices
Income approx.
1955 100 100
1956 98 87
1957 116 111
1958 87 87
1959 87 69
1960 106 82
1961 95 75
1962 97 80
1963 98 85
1964 123 105
These figures indicate a “growth” rate
of 11 p.c. per annum which is, of course,
considerably less than the rate of in-
flation.
None of the foregoing need have any
application to future prospects, but it is
difficult to see at this stage how the pat-
tern has changed so that Elder's share*
have been promoted to the growth stock
class.
In the directors’ interim report they
say . . higher prices for rural primary
products have produced buoyant trading
conditions for the half-year, and al-
though savings from integration have
been largely offset by increased costs, a
higher net profit has been achieved”.
Perhaps the most significant part of
the statement is that savings from inte-
gration have been largely offset by higher
costs.
/Aver the years, Elder's have acquired a
variety of investment interests. The
company has fairly substantial share in-
terests in the Commercial Union Assur-
ance Co. of Australia Ltd, in Group
Holdings Australia Ltd (a company
with several activities, including official
short-term money market operations),
and in Lensworth Finance Ltd. However,
too much emphasis could be placed on
this aspect.
Income from investments totalled
nearly £466,000 in 1962-63, represent-
ing about 26 p.c. of earnings and about
5.7 p.c. in the market value of the total
investment portfolio. As nearly 60 p.c.
of these investments were in Australian
public securities, this investment income
must have been subject to a certain
amount of tax which would mean that
the comparison with after tax earnings
is rather spurious.
To return to the comparison with
Dalgety's, the index of dividend income
of that company would Be approximately
as follows:
1955 100 1960 134
1956 100 1961 134
1957 100 1962 134
1958 .118 1963 151
1959 118 1964 ?
The interim dividend for the 1963-64
year will not be declared until early
April, and even then it will probably not
give any indication of the likely total
dividend for the year, since in the past it
seems to have been the final dividend
which has been increased. Nevertheless,
from 1955 to 1963 the dividend income
has increased by 51 p.c. and represents
an average annual rate of about 4.7 p.c.
On the basis of past performance, then,
Dalgety's seem much more attractive
than Elder's. Regrettably the companies’
standard of reporting prevents a worth-
while appraisal since a per share earnings
trend cannot be produced in the case of
Elder's. Both companies are undoubted
leaders in their field and by their size
seem to dominate the pastoral finance
sector. At present prices, Dalgety's seem
rather more attractive than Elder's.
N.B. —- Because of the mergers and the non-
comparability of earlier figures, no summaries
of accounts ore produced on this occasion.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Ferris’s Battle for Profits
A small company with big opposition
TfcECLARATroN of an interim dividend
of 4 p.c., suggesting an increase of
2 p.c. over last year's annual payment,
and hints of a one-for-five par issue next
November or thereabouts, have support-
ed the ss. shares of Ferris,lndustries.Ltd
to around 65., a height which this stock
has not seen for several years.
As one of the smaller manufacturers
of television receivers, Ferris was unable
to continue their production economically
when the TV boom waned. Manufac-
ture ceased in September, 1960, but
Ferris is now making TV sets under
contract for one company.
The current range of operations is
from the manufacture of car radios to the
installation of television aerials and the
manufacture of telecomponents both for
the company’s own requirements and for
outside customers.
Accent now is on self-sufficiency in
the processes of manufacture. Since May,
1963, the company has been able to
make all its own plastic components, and
at the end of October an electroplating
works was installed. Other processes will
be introduced to further this trend, which
promotes efficiency and economies.
A one-third interest is held in Channel
Master (NZ) Ltd, which traded profitably
in its first year and declared a dividend.
Shareholders were informed that to date
this company had operated on a small
capital, but that it might be necessary
to increase the capital shortly.
Ferris also had a 50 p.c. interest in
Ferris Industries (Malaysia) Ltd, repre-
senting an investment of £14,700. It has
sold some of its holding to General
Electric Co., which now has the majority
interest.
Results of trading for the last June
year were an improvement from £26,331
to £34,289 in profit, after providing
£7,819 more for tax at £23,294. De-
preciation was virtually unchanged at
£10,400.
Dividend was lifted from 5 to 6 p.c.
paid in one sum. The existing rate crept
up from 10.0 to 13.0 p.c. on capital
unchanged for the last four years.
The 2s. 6d. uncalled on 200,000 ss.
shares at last balance date was paid up
in July, so paid capital is now £278,500,
net of the £12,000 held by a subsidiary
company.
A loan on second mortgage of £25,000
was obtained during 1962-63 from the
Manufacturers’ Mutual Insurance Co.
Ltd, and this was apparently sufficient,
with internal funds available, to extend
the Brookvale (NSW) plant by 16,000
square feet.
Over the rough patch of trading ex-
perienced from 1959 the company was
able to keep afloat thanks to deposit
money. Ferris is anxious not to increase
share capital sharply, so deposits will still
be relied on for working capital.
(The £20,150 in 8 p.c. registered
deposits maturing on August 23, 1963,
and the £43,669 term deposits maturing
before June 30, 1964, though included
by the company amongst deferred
liabilities, might have been more strictly
defined as current liabilities.)
By careful management and a sensible
and realistic dividend policy, directors
predicted they would eventually be able
to reduce the company’s dependence on
loan funds because of a build-up in ac-
cumulated and undistributed profits.
The chairman (Mr G. I. Ferris) told
shareholders at the annual meeting in
November last that more fixed capital
was desirable, and the board had in mind
an issue to shareholders a year hence of
around £50,000.
By this announcement and a drawing
of attention to the 6 p.c. dividend paid
last year in a final and the possibility of
a 4 p.c. interim (which came to pass),
directors were obviously conscious of
the need to improve the share price.
Long advance notice of a share issue
is a good carrot for investors, but they
should decide objectively whether the
carrot is worthwhile.
Interim report of record sales in the
December six months, with turnover well
in excess of budget, was indeed welcome
news.
The trends are encouraging, but a
small company in a highly competitive
business wages a continuous struggle
to preserve profitability.
The financial position is still precarious,
and investors should remember that after
ten years of public operations, accumulat-
ed reserves are only <£123,914 against
which should be offset intangibles of
£90,715.

ADVERTISER NEWSPAPERS LTD
Newspaper’s One-for-One Bonus
fTVtE success of its own operations and
that of its investments has enabled
Advertiser Newspapers Ltd to take the
momentous step of making a one-for-
one bonus.
Issued capital after the bonus is
£4,799,966. Assets revaluation reserve
was the major source for this capitalisa-
tion.
The investment in Herald and Weekly
Times Ltd (of 1,875,000 ss. shares)
now stands in the books at 235. 4d. each.
As their present market value is around
545. 6d., there’s plenty more where that
comes from for Advertiser shareholders.
Advertiser Newspapers publishes the
only morning paper in Adelaide, the
“Advertiser”. Its circulation is now
firmly established above 200,000 in a
State where the population is just over
one million. (It also has a half-interest
in the “Sunday Mail”, the only Sunday
paper in Adelaide.)
The company's Adelaide radio station,
SAD, is now on the air 24 hours a day,
and the chairman (Sir Lloyd Dumas)
told shareholders at the last annual meet-
ing that every survey showed it was the
most popular station in Adelaide. The
three country stations, SMU Murray


Bridge, SPI Crystal Brook and SSE
Mount Gambier, have no competition in
the areas they serve. The broadcasting
network made substantial contribution
to 1963 group profit.
Television Broadcasters Ltd, opera-
ting ADS 7 (in which the company owns
40 p.c. of the capital) paid 8 p.c. again
in 1963.
In January, 1961, Vardon Price Ltd,
printer of labels, wrappers, booklets and
cartons, was acquired. In 1962 this was
merged with The Griffin Press, formerly
a department of Advertiser Newspapers.
All printing activities have now been
integrated in a new factory at Netley
covering 154,000 square feet, which
makes it one of the largest printing
houses in the country.
Two companies in the packaging busi-
ness sought refuge from interstate
marauders in the arms of the Advertiser.
They were National Paper Industries Ltd,
with the largest paper bag factory in SA,
and Vuepak Holdings Ltd, which mostly
prints transparent and flexible packaging.
The National Paper takeover in-
volved the issue of £125,000 in share
capital. The Vuepak deal took place
in 1964, and Advertiser shares issued
are ex-bonus. In both instances the
existing management remains.
Advertiser directors believe these take-
overs will give the group a broader base
and greater diversification.
Profit for the year to December 31
rose from £523,035 to £711,241,' after
providing for tax £330,430 (1962
£221,594) and for depreciation
£224,909 (£183,889).
The £1,008,000 in 8 p.c. notes con-
verted to ordinary shares on January 1,
1963, so the earning rate receded from
43.1 to 30.9 p.c. Ordinary dividend
commitment (on a steady 15 p.c.) rose
from £177,447 to £339,064.
Since 1960 about £4 million has been
spent on plant and buildings. Part of
this, of course, was provided by the note
issue late in 1959, a little by premium
issues to employees, but the major part
was financed from internal sources
a considerable achievement.
Directors feel the company can now
afford to be more generous to its share-
holders, although the annual expenditure
on plant will continue to be substantial.
Apart from the investment in the
Herald and Weekly Times and Television
Broadcasters, the company also has a
substantial holding in Australian News-
print Mills Holdings Ltd, and a much
lesser investment in Queensland L?ess
Ltd.
The company's accounts reflect the
conservatism of management, yet at the
same time it has been imaginative and
skilful in building up the assets and
earning power of the group.
The chairman said in his annual
address that “on the basis of one bonus
share for each share held, with a divi-
dend of 10 p.c. instead of the 15 p.c.
recently paid, shareholders will receive
an increase in their income from this
source of 33J p.c. Unless something
entirely unforeseen happens, directors
are confident that this rate of dividend
can be maintained”.
Ex-bonus, the ss. shares are now
around 28s. 6d. where the yield on a
10 p.c. dividend is only 1.8 p.c. Some
newspapers are still yielding Advertiser
shares on a 15 p.c. dividend, which is
probably responsible for the excessive
market valuation of the shares.
If there were no improvement in pro-
fit rate this year (taking a conservative
stand) the earning rate on doubled capi-
tal would be 15.5 p.c., so it would be
out of character for directors to exceed
the 10 p.c. rate which they have stipula-
ted for 1964.
As largesse has just been distributed
it seems entirely unreasonable for the
market to be already looking for more,
and intending investors should look
elsewhere in the newspaper field.

H. OLDFIELD AND SON H’GS LTD
Small Capital Tightly Held
TJ. Oldfield and Son Holdings Ltd
has maintained market popularity
due principally to the smallness of its
capital and the fairly tight holding of its
shares.
The company began making paint
brushes in a small way in 1916 and now
operates from a factory at Leichhardt.
Two of the executive directors are a son
and a grandson of the founder.
Stock Exchange listing was acquired
early in 1960 with a public placement of
160,000 ss. shares at ss. 3d. plus charges.
Paid-up capital has remained at a
well-held £120,000, all in fully-paid
ordinary shares.
Profit in the first year of listing was
£30,935, equal to 25.8 p.c. on capital,
but with the advent of the credit squeeze
earnings fell to £18,053, equal to 15 p.c.
on capital, rose slightly the following
year, and in 1962-63 came out at
£17,366, equal to 14.6 p.c. on capital.
Directors, therefore, have had no trouble
in maintaining the prospectus forecast of
10 p.c. dividends.
Last year's drop in earnings was due
to an increase in the cost of bristles
which represents a large proportion of
costs. Turnover for the year rose.
Increased prices for finished paint
brushes did not come into effect until
the current year after consultation with
other manufacturers. Profit for 1963-64
should reflect the benefit.
The 1962-63 accounts show a healthy
position at last balance date. Stock was
down from £149,571 to £137,891, while
debtors remained almost stationary at

£32,093 (down £539). More than half
the stock figure was represented by
bristles, of which the company keeps
about a year’s supply on hand in order
to obviate delays caused by late deliveries
from overseas.
Increased liquidity was evident. Credi-
tors were about steady at £28,349, while
bank overdraft was down from £31,449
to £21,396 and short-term deposits at call
were reduced from £26,893 to £17,315.
A long-term loan of £30,000 appears
in the books, being a loan from members
of the Oldfield family made at the time
of the public placement.
The reserves position is strong, the

The market is currently pricing the
shares around Bs. 6d. near the best point
since early 1960.

HARPER DAVIDSON IND. LTD
Stepping Up the Ladder
TTarper Davidson Industries Ltd,
. A Sydney-based ladder maker, made a
bad slip when it incurred a loss of
£12,887 in 1952-53, the first full year
of listing, but since then its profit history
has been good with earnings giving a
wide coverage to the dividend payout.
Although Sydney based, the company
has since 1949 operated a ladder-making
factory in Victoria. It has its own saw-
mill, and operates a full-scale timber
yard and joinery works at a leased
factory at Rydalmere. It also established
a brick factory at Abbotsford in Victoria
in 1955.
The group’s profit history has been
good. Profit rose from £14,148 in 1954
to a record £30,532 in 1960, fell to
£21,812 in 1962 and recovered to
£25,841 last year equal to 19.4 p.c. on
capital after preference charges.
Dividend has risen from 8 p.c. in 1954
to the 12} p.c. rate paid for the past
four years.
The balance sheet at June 30 last
revealed a very strong liquid position
following the sale of freehold property
and the move to leased premises. Over-
draft was reduced from £41,667 to
£19,287, creditors were down from
£17,165 to £14,187 and unsecured loans
from £38,000 to £29,000.
Stock was up only slightly from
£72,556 to £76,168, but debtors showed
a sharp increase from £48,714 to
£87,956. Reflecting the sale of freehold,
this item was down from £134,352 to
£84,371.
The reserve position was quite good,
with each ss. ordinary share having a
tangible assets backing of 7s. 9d. Intan-
gibles are in the books at £35,694.
The current year has begun well, with
record sales in the half-year to December,
and a 20 p.c. lift in profit.
Higher production costs have been
offset in some areas with price adjust-
ments, while additional price changes are
planned.
The shares are currently selling around
10s. and at that level they should prove
good buying.

[?]PECULATOR’S DIARY
Leaving Growth for Income Class?
Amalgamated Chemicals produces sense of disappointment
Over a period of time an active investor
becomes much more closely as-
sociated with some companies than with
others. Such is my case with Hanimex
and Amalgamated Chemicals. Both are
selling about the same price and both
made announcements last week, but from
there on their paths separate.
Amalgamated Chemicals announced
an 8 p.c. fall in net profits for the year
ended December 31, 1963. Following
increases in capital through takeovers,
earning rate on average capital fell much
more heavily from 28.8 to 22.8 p.c.
Tax provision was again apparently low.
The curious outcome of this performance
was that directors decided to raise the
final dividend from 6£ to 7i p.c.
Those shareholders who have to wait
for the public announcement of the
year’s result must have been bewildered
by the steady fall in price from 18s. 6d.
at the beginning of the year to 15s. 6d.
on the day before the announcement. It
has, after all, been a generally strong
market. Chartists would have recognised
the stock’s weakness last month.
The other company, Hanimex, issued
an unobtrusive but optimistic interim
report. Initially cloaked in the statement
that profits before tax would not be less
than those for the previous year, direc-
tors then went on to tell about the
proposed increase in projector produc-
tion, the success of the Perutz film pro-
cessing plant and the considerable growth
in exports. Also of importance is the
news that the shares are being listed in
London.
If I’d been a shareholder in Amal-
gamated Chemicals then, now would
seem to be the time to make the switch
into Hanimex share for share. As
I’m not, I simply bought another 500
Hanimex.
Almost as dear to me as Hanimex is
Tableland Tin. Last Monday week this
latter company announced that 129 tons
of tin were mined for the 4 weeks ended
March 4. While this does not sound
very much against metal production
figures at Mt Isa, it is a most significant
announcement viewed in the light of the
chairman's address last year.
He said then that it was proposed to
move the dredge to the Finches Area
by January. He estimated that 3134 tons
of tin could be recovered in the next
three years to give an after-tax profit
of £571,000 (the world tin price was then
under £900). The calculation was based
on a recovery rate of 12 oz. of tin per
cubic yard. This latest production report
shows a recovery rate of 17 oz per cubic
yard.
A big question is what is to happen
to the world tin price, now at £llOO.
An announcement by the GSA about
the future disposal of the US tin pile
is due very shortly. In recent months,
normal weekly releases from the stock-
pile have had little effect on the tin
price and only a massive release would
capsize the present tin price level.
So back into Tableland Tin I went
with a purchase of 400 at 365. 6d. It
probably sounds like a reversal of face
when I tell you that I sold my Renison
rights at 17s. a profit of £9. The
400 old shares still hold their position in
the portfolio.
Other sales this week were the 200
Philip Morris at 395. 3d. and the 1500
Prasby at an average price of 3s. Id.
Both share prices seem to have become
static. After last week’s reversal, the
profit of £2O between them was quite
gratifying.
The week’s transactions were:
SOLD
400 Renison Rts 17/- £333
1500 Prasby 3/1 £2lB
200 Philip Morris 39/3 £387
BOUGHT
500 Hanimex 14/11 £3BO
400 Tableland Tin 36/6 £742
The result in my account after these
transactions is a debit of £484. This
state is a fair indication of my confidence
in the market after the fall.

Moulded’s New Form
/Ald favorite in the plastics industry,
Moulded Products (Australasia) Ltd
has redeemed itself with a 1963 trading
result on a par with that produced in
1959.
It still falls short of the 1960 peak of
£406,821, but a profit of £385,325 in
the last year to December, giving an
earning rate of 19.3 p.c., is a creditable
performance.
There seems little doubt that the 13-
year-old 14 p.c. dividend will be repeated
once more, although why directors can’t
say so in their preliminary profit state-
ment is hard to understand.
Investment allowances relating to new
installations of productive equipment not
only gave tax relief this year the pro-
vision was only £134,905 but
should equip the company to compete
effectively in future.
The trading improvement took the
market by surprise, and the sale price
leaped Is. to 12s. 9d.
As the programme of reorganisation
and consolidation, with elimination of
unprofitable lines, has proved its worth
already, the ss. shares should appreciate
further to something like 14s.
Having survived the 1961 year when
reserves had to be drawn on to keep
pace, shareholders may not have the
same sense of security about their in-
vestment, but at least newcomers should
be willing to accept a 5 p.c. income
return in this market.
Investors in the Dark
/Construction and civil engineer Mc-
Donald Industries Ltd could have
been more informative about the im-
provement in results for the first half
of- the 1963-64 financial year.
In 1961-62 it shocked followers with
a profit drop to about half the usual
level, and earning rate of 10.6 p.c. gave
little margin for the customary 10 p.c.
dividend.
Now shareholders are told that work
in hand is much larger in volume than
in previous years, but that margins are
still low. This does not give them
much of a line on what 1963-64 profit
might be, or what the profit was for the
first half.
The ss. shares are now traded around
10s. lOd. where income return is 4.6 p.c.
Of late the company has added road
construction and real estate develop-
ment to its range of activities in design
and construction of industrial building,
civil, mechanical and electrical engi-
neering, heavy erection, machine manu-
facture and merchandising, plant hire,
sand supply and pipe fabrication.

Color Television Crusader
jy|R C. O. Stanley, the forceful yet genial chairman of
British Electronic Industries (the Pye and E. K. Cole
group), used prolific Irish charm to fence with Press questions
concerning exact financial relations between his company and
Australia’s quite separate Electronic Industries.
But he joined charm and crusading enthusiasm to hymn
the virtues and forthcoming conquests of color television
without any concealment.
A local invasion is not early on the cards, though manu-
facturers, happy enough with country expansion now, can
rejoice that color will probably call for a two TV set home.
Shades of a Government inquiry must undoubtedly impose
themselves first.
America has operated color TV, albeit with fairly short
projection times, for about 10 years and BEI is in close
technical touch with the US system. Britain, on the verge
of going into color, will almost certainly adopt this method
in preference to the rival French and German systems.
Retrospective Dumping Measures?
HPhe present machinery for dealing with dumping is slow and
cumbersome, says Mr C. P. Puzev, director of the Aus-
tralian Industries Development Association, in his March
report.
He suggests that dumping be removed from the jurisdiction
of the Tariff Board and placed in the hands of an authority
similar to that handling the Emergency Tariff procedures. The
Minister would then receive quick advice of dumping, or sus-
pected dumping, or end-of-season sales, and be able quickly
to take remedial action.
Mr Puzey thinks that any dispute about the authority’s
findings could then be made subject to appeal to the Minister,
who would refer the appeal to his department for more
thorough investigation.
Importers are well aware that they are importing dumped
goods. AIDA previously suggested to the Minister for Customs
that dumping duties should be retrospective. This is more likely
(together with The Bulletin’s previous suggestion of amend-
ing the Act) to curb dumping than any other measure.
AIDA believes it is urgent that adequate measures to control
dumping be formulated. Increasing production capacity in
industrial nations will bring an increase in dumping, particularly
in industries of high capitalisation.
Gallaher Attacks Filter Field
■VTone of Australia’s cigarette makers appears to be unduly
taken aback by the US Surgeon-General's report on lung
cancer. With echoes of the findings barely fading away, the
latest newcomer to the scene is just launching its first locally
manufactured product.
The old and celebrated Gallaher Ltd, of London, made an
organisational bow to Australia in September last year through
Gallaher International (Australia) Ltd, formed for the group’s
initial international venture. Other manufacturers have keenly
awaited the start of what promises to be extremely lively
competition.
Gallaher moves into action with “Edinburgh” king-size filters,
because the filter market has “increased by 500 per cent in
the past five years and now represents nearly 75 per cent of
total cigarette consumption”.
The home company (sole owner of the Australian establish-
ment) lifted pre-tax profits from £stg24- million to £l6l mil-
lion between 1954 and 1962 and claims 35 p.c. of the UK
cigarette and tobacco market. The two accepted Australian
giants and their smaller companions will need to call on great
skill to withstand Gallaher’s proven and vigorous selling ability.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
“Big Bill” Gunn and his Visit
to Red China
Will it be followed by Federal politics?
T ike Richard Nixon and the US Presi-
dency, Sir William Gunn has con-
sistently denied that he has any ideas
of entering Federal politics. And, as in
the case of Nixon, some astute observers
consistently ignore these denials.
“Big Bill”, they say, will throw his
wide-brimmed hat into the arena when
he is good and ready. And he may be
ready soon.
His latest coup, the visit to Peking to
talk with the Red Chinese about bigger
purchases of Australian wool and train-
ing for Red Chinese technicians, is an
indication of Gunn's political acumen.
The “big fellow” has a flair for coming
up with the right thing at the right time.
The Peking visit comes at a time when
both the Australian Wool Board and the
International Wool Secretariat (he is
chairman of both) are under fire from
Japanese and local critics who have
alleged, with considerable backing, that
the quality of the Australian merino clip
has deteriorated.
The point is that where the Japanese
want quality wool for fashionable
sweaters and other more glamorous
apparel, the Red Chinese will want
ordinary to average wool for socks, over-
coats and, fairly obviously, military uni-
forms. And they will want plenty of it.
As economic geographer E. J. Donath
has pointed out, an extra pair of woollen
socks a year for every Chinese would
mean an extra million bales of wool
worth £6O million.
Tn the light of this emergence (or is it
a reminder?) of such a potentially
enormous market the fears over Japan,
justified as they are, may be expected
to recede somewhat.
Credit where credit is due ... Sir
William has a way of winning. The
“Gunn for Canberra” movement does
not go in for blowing trumpets. Rather
it takes the form of quietly persuasive
argument (in the right places, of course)
that here is a man too gifted to be
relegated forever to running the Wool
Board. And where else at the present
time is there a man so suited for political
office?
It is agreed that he could have had
Country Party endorsement long ago.
But what his supporters want for him is
not any more than a start as a Liberal
back-bencher. (No one has ever suggested
he is a likely ALP candidate.)
If, and when, Sir William enters the
Federal sphere it will be pretty much as
Sir Garfield Barwick did with a blue
ribbon seat and a certain job lined up.
That is about the only similarity between
Sir William and Sir Garfield.
Barwick, despite his brilliant legal
career, has never captured the public
imagination. He remains a somewhat
obscure figure to the great majority, of
Australians and this has nothing to do
with the job he does.
Gunn, on the other hand, definitely has
the common touch. When he talks any-
one can understand him, or —and this is
more to the point—they think they can.
He is the straight shooter; the dinkum
bloke, the sportsman. (He did, in fact,
play football rather well—Rugby Union,
naturally).
Even his most bitter enemies, the wool-
growers who pelted him with eggs and
flour during last year’s up-the-promotion
levy campaign for example, admire Gunn
as a man.
If he does surround himself with a
strangely assorted group of advisers, in-
cluding Eric White and Associates PR
types, so what? Isn't that playing it
smart? The average Australian has a
strange affection for rough-hewn types
who can beat the city slickers at their
own game.
A thing which points strongly to a
move into politics for Gunn is, simply
enough, the matter of his age. He is
49 which, on today’s standards, makes
him almost a bright young man.
He has had the wool job for quite a
time now and for a number of reasons
a change at the top may be desirable.
If he does not go into politics what
will he do? He has a son to take care
of the family property at Goondiwindi.
He enjoys the “big time” of the wool
game and, because of his frequent trips
abroad, is better known in many countries
than the great majority of politicians
(maybe even Sir Garfield).
He has, from the beginning, shown an
appreciation of what PR and the pro-
jection of the personal image can do to
a degree which makes many older poli-
ticians almost rank amateurs by compari-
son. And with it all—whether on TV
or in person —he conveys the impression
of the good bloke, the no-nonsense,
down-to-earth boy from the bush who
can crutch a sheep with the best and
also, when the occasion demands, handle
a cocktail glass in the approved manner.
How the Peking visit works out is
anybody’s guess. All that is definite is
that Red China would like to buy more
wool, has the money to pay for it, and
would like to have training for tech-
nicians provided within the International
Wool Secretariat scheme.
/Critics who argue that we are putting
our heads in the mouth of the
dragon because of our increasing wool
(and wheat) exports to Red China do
not get much of a hearing.
Sir William Kent Hughes gets letters
published occasionally and appears now
and again on TV but, ha'ving made his
point, gets little support from anyone
who matters.
Mr B. A. Santamaria has openly called
the offer of technical help to Red China
a political stunt primarily, but has not
said why it is political. He has, how-
ever, raised some good points:
• It would involve the use of public
and woolgrowers’ money.
• Who would provide a security
check of technicians trained here?
• The Wool Board has no more right
to embark on such a scheme than would
the Waterside Workers’ Federation in
the sense that such action must help
shape Australia’s foreign policy.
Mr Santamaria weakened his case,
however, by referring to Red China’s
“currency problem”. What impresses
the majority is the fact that the Red
Chinese are, to date anyway, not only
buyers but payers and often in ad-
vance.
After Britain, Japan, and the US, Red
China is now our fourth largest export
market taking nearly half our wheat,
about £ll million of wool, plus skim
milk, oats, hides and tallow.
After Russia and Canada we are now
Red China’s third largest supplier. Wool
could move us up to second. In the

Moscow and Peking being extended to
trade, we could even find ourselves in
first place.
Red Chinese consumption of wool is
low about 0.2 lb. a head a year.
(Japan 2.5; Australia 10.) The climate
is cold in many regions and the stand-
ard of living, we are told, is rising.
Money to pay for wool would come
from increasing Red China exports of
cotton textiles, heavy machinery, che-
micals and so on backed by reserves of
silver and other minerals.
Current advertisements in Australian
newspapers for the Chinese Export Com-
modities Fair in Canton in May are
interesting as are, on a much smaller
scale, the gloves and jackets appearing
in Australian chain stores.
The picture looks bright for vastly
increased wool sales to Red China ex-
cept for one question. They are not
fools and there has been nothing to
stop them buying as much wool as they
wanted any time they liked. It will be
interesting to see how hard a bargain
they drive on the other part of the deal
technical assistance.
Security, as Mr Santamaria sees it,
might not be involved really. But how
many technicians do you train? Ten,
twenty, a thousand, or twenty thousand?
And what might the US attitude be
to an IWS scheme to build a bigger pilot
plant in Red China than, for instance,
in India?
(Mr Santamaria’s further point that
this sort of thing is the responsibility of
the Federal Government will undoubted-
ly please the Gunn-for-Canberra move-
ment.)
Sir William’s answer to these questions
is: “While the Board hopes to provide
China with technical assistance and ad-
vice, any request will have to be care-
fully considered and be subject to an
on-the-spot examination by experts”.
Nearly two years ago Sir William and
the IWS director, Mr William Vines,
had talks in Hong Kong with Red
Chinese representatives on similar mat-
ters.
The invitation to visit Peking has
been open for some time. It is difficult
to disassociate the Peking visit from the
impending crisis in Sir William Gunn’s
spectacular career.
The long awaited report on wool
marketing is due soon and woolgrowers
made it rather clear during last year’s
campaign to get their support for a
higher promotion levy that they are
expecting changes in marketing. Indeed,
many woolgrowers stipulated that they
would agree to a higher levy only on
condition that marketing changes were
forthcoming.
This, to his credit, Sir William did

Remarkably enough Sir William is
not a member of the committee studying
marketing.
He is himself apparently convinced
that changes in marketing are necessary.
He has never exactly said this but has
gone rather close. On this there is no
reason to doubt his sincerity.
Should the coming report advocate
little or no change and the rumors
are gaining ground we might expect
to see Sir William involved in. a Rugby
scrum from which, being Sir William,
he could emerge holding the ball and
upwards.
India’s Fuel Problem
Cakes that are made to he burnt
From RONALD ANDERSON in New Delhi
PP-o the man on the farm, in Australia,
A cow-dung is an invaluable natural
fertiliser which helps to improve crops
and pastures alike. But in India, where
five-sixths of the population lives in
villages and three people out of four are
totally dependent on agriculture, cow-
dung is first and foremost a fuel.' It’s
too precious to be used as a mere
fertiliser.
Outside almost every house in India’s
840,000 communities, flattened “cakes”
of dung, each about 8 inches in diameter,
can be seen plastered on every sunny
wall. Where there are no walls the cakes
are carefully stacked in the open, so
that sun and air can get at them.
Dung-cakes are the only fuel used
for cooking and heating by the over-
whelming majority of India’s 440 million
people. The cakes, burnt four to six at
a time on an open fire, give off a surpris-
ingly strong and even heat. They are
almost smoke-free ... a good thing in
a land in which millions of crude mud-
huts have no chimneys.
Women make the dung-cakes by hand,
squatting in the sun outside their houses,
in a bullock or buffalo yard, or on the
roadside.
India has 160 million head of cattle —
more than one to every four humans.
The Indian Ministry of Food and Agri-
culture and State authorities are, there-
fore, trying to convince millions of
illiterate farmers that all animal manure
should go back into the soil.
To help drive home its point the
Government has built in some villages,
concrete compost pits for manure, straw
and other refuse. But the campaign has
made barely token progress. The reason
is plain to any person who travels through
India the absence of any alternative
fuel.
In some areas there is still sufficient
wood to fire charcoal cookers. But over
the greater part of the sub-continent wood
is scarce and fuels such as kerosene are
hopelessly out of the reach of a man
with four or five children who earns the
equivalent of 15s. a week.
In a few villages the authorities have
urged all cow and buffalo owners to put
their animals’ dung into a closed pit. The
gas from the decaying manure is then
piped off for cooking.
The cost of piping the gas throughout
even a small village, the uncertainty of
the supply and the difficulty of getting
conservative and wary villagers to co-
operate, makes the success of this project
doubtful.
The Government is hopeful that its
campaign will prove more effective as
electrification of villages progresses, but
I find it hard to agree. I have visited
scores of so-called “electrified” villages
in the sub-continent and have found the
power used only for lighting and some
light machinery, and then only in a few
homes. Usually it is far too expensive
for cooking.
Even in the wealthier sections of quite
large cities kerosene, rather than electri-
city, is used for cooking.
At least for the foreseeable future,
then, it looks as if Indian housewives
will go on burning the cakes!

MOW
£50m. More “Vegies” in 30 Years
We may then have cabbage millionaires
■JI/lonashville, believe it or not, is the
name of a planned housing estate
not far from the impressive and futuristic
skyscraper that is Victoria’s new Monash
University.
While the homes to be built at Mon-
ashville are unlikely to equal the Univer-
sity building in design, they will, no
doubt, afford shelter and comfort for
those who inhabit them.
Writers of the calibre of Robin Boyd
(“The Australian Ugliness”) may discuss
Monashville and all the other “villes” in
more detail architecturally. Our point is
relatively easy to make.
Ten years ago the site of Monash, and
Monashville, was part of Melbourne’s
market garden. The plain between Mel-
bourne proper and Dandenong produced
much of the daily intake of vegetables
of the metropolis.
There is not much left of it now to
grow cabbages, caulies and beans and
peas.
It is not true that the vegetable grow-
ers have been forced off their land. Many
have retired on the undreamed of pro-
fits of the sale of their lands to the sub-
dividers. But the city is growing and
the vegetables will have to come from
somewhere.
The same thing can be said of Sydney
and will be seen in Brisbane, Perth and
Adelaide probably.
It is estimated that in the next 30 years
Australia will have to increase the pro-
duction of vegetables by about £5O mil-
lion (today's values).
The CSIRO believes that at least 25
p.c. of the increase could well be
contained within the Murrumbidgee Irri-
gation Area and Coleambally. It would
be reasonable to see a vegetable pro-
duction increase of £250,000 to
£375,000 annually in that area.
Australia’s population is expected to
rise by 2.5 million over the next 10
years. In the next 30 it should double,
and by that time food production will
have to have increased by 70 p.c. if we
are to continue to produce our own food.
The southern irrigation areas appear
to be the most reliable source for the
increased growing of vegetables. But it
will assuredly be a different kind of vege-
table farming.
The accent will be on mechanisation
and large-scale operations. We will pro-
bably see that US phenomenon, as yet
unknown here the cauliflower or the
cabbage millionaire.
Instead of breaking his back on 15
acres, he will control acreages of 400 and
up, and will work with a telephone and
private plane rather than a hoe and
wheelbarrow.
Fruit, too, must expand although
not as much as vegetables—and this
will hearten those fruit-growers who
have been hard hit by the falling off
in exports. At least a 20 p.c. increase in
fruit will be necessary to cope with in-
creased home demand over the next 30
years.
Providing, of course, our population
does increase as expected, other rural
industries should also benefit. There
will be a need for 60 p.c. more dairying
and 40 p.c. beef.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Producing Better Wool
Sir,
I read the very good article (Bulletin,
29/2/64), “Is The Wool Board Doing Its
Job?” and agree with everything except
one statement, and that is “It takes four
years at least for anything really to
show”. This statement referred to the
time it takes when changing rams to
produce better wool.
I started woolgrowing in 1905 and was
followed 30 years later by my son. From
the start I was lucky in getting some
good ewes and rams and many times got
top price at Sydney wool sales. On one
occasion I got top price of the season
which held for some weeks. I cut for
years from 90 to a few over a 100 bales
annually.
Thinking to improve the weights the
sheep were cutting, on the advice of a
sheep classer and a stud I bought some
rams which utterly ruined my wool. They
produced what must have been the worst
wool in Australia and I have now many
samples which I kept of this awful stuff,
doggy and numerous other varieties.
I thought it would take me years to
get back on the rails but I was wrong.
On my own judgment this time, I bought
some rams from a stud which bred from
within itself and in one cross completely
eliminated all bad wool by reason of the
fact that the rams were extremely pre-
potent, a virtue that rams must have to
breed good, even quality wool.
We have now used this strain for 37
years and last year my son won 21
prizes at a country show (many of them
firsts) and two champions.
I have no time for sheep shows as
no matter how good a ram looks and
how good his wool, if he has as many
strains in his blood as there are colors
in a rainbow he is likely to breed all
sorts of faults in his progeny.

Woolgrowers Must Aim
at Quality
first of a series of pamphlets on
the subject of Merino wool improve-
ment, titled, “The Importance of Con-
tinual Improvement in Merino Wool,”
emphasises that, in the face of man-made
fibre competition, one of the greatest
needs to-day is to lessen the gulf between
stud and commercial flocks.
“If wool and, in particular, Merino
wool, is to hold its place in the fibre
markets of the world,” the pamphlet
states, “continual improvement must be
the watchword of the industry.
“Applied to Merino wool, ‘quality’
reflects all the characteristics in the staple
that will make a quality cloth. A wool
possessing evenness of length, regularity
of spinning count, softness of handle and
soundness of fibre can well be described
as possessing quality. This must become
the ultimate aim for the producers of
Merino wool in Australia.”
