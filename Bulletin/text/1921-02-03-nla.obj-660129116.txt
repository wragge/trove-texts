Falstaff in Fleet-street
While Belloc passes from the records of
Romance to roaring satire or ridicule of
some Tariff Reform, Chesterton with pro-
digious laughter cheers him on. Together
they treat the subject of their dislikes with
unfailing ridicule. They caricature their
contempts. They mock their own theories.
They pelt philosophy with epigrams and roll
pedantry in the gutter, laughing hugely at
their own smartness. Shaw called 'this
collaboration the “Chesterbelioc—a very
amusing pantomime elephant.” Chesterton
replied with one of tiis wittiest books,
“George Bernard Shaw,” jeering at Shaw’s
vegetarianism, denying his democracy, and
deciding that on the whole he was a good
republican. J
Gilbert Keith Chesterton, the son of a
West London estate-agent, was (born in
1873. He once sat on a high stool adding
up the figures of a ledger and drawing gar-
goyles on his blotting-pad. But at the end
of the 19th century, when the Yellow Book
epoch was being quietly buried, he launched
his first book, "Greybeards at Play,” against
the “crapulous exoticism of contemporary
literature.” His onslaught on Fleet-street
was sudden and fierce. Fantastic verse,
romances, pictures, paradoxical essays and
criticism were poured out in a perpetual
stream before he was 30. And to-day the
output continues of an astonishing fertility
in daily, weekly and monthly papers. He
has restored the elementary virtues to litera-
ture. He has written a fairy-drama called
“Magic,” detective stories, “Manaiive,” and
“The Club of Queer Trades.” His book on
Browning and Dickens and the Victorian
Age in Literature ranks with the best criti-
cism of the epoch.
He is the fattest man in Fleet-street. He
dresses with the distinction of a circus-boss,
lie is fond of comfort, cabs, controversy
and beer; and he prefers the homely fare
of a tavern meal “to decorous malnutrition
at two shillings a mouthful.” The universe
is his toy. Life is a kaleidoscope of primal
colors. Time is an accident. Tie clings to
the visions of his childhood, where the visible
world is a fairyland and adventure the only
reality. He has a proneness for pantomime
and paradox, and is never tired of tomfool-
ery. While pelting his adversary with puns
he laughs loudest himself. And when he
has nothing else to do lie talks about God.
All his thoughts are collected into a mirth-
ful splutter of epigrams till his hearers are
uncertain whether he is firing off a barrage
of arguments or a farrago of magnificent
nonsense. That is why Chesterton is gen-
erally conceived as a chuckle.
sOf his wit there can be no question; and
he himself has a firm belief in Lis serious-
ness. He has entered the lists against
McCabe and Biatcbford on the question of
Christianity, because he regards atheism as
a worse dogma than belief, and because he
is capable of believing. anything that reason
repudiates. ' The mem before‘Chesterton who
formed the Yellow Book team rejected life:
tfiey regarded art as the only escape. Ches-
terton’s attitude is one of thorough accept-
ance, He is chief priest in the'cathedral
of conformity. Wells and Shaw decry pre-
sent _ civilisation: the former dreams of
Utopia > the latter calls for the elimination
of the yahoo and the breeding of the super-
ipan. But Chesterton has none of the
reformer’s impatience with society. He tilts
qlike at Fabians and Freethinkers, at Jews
hud Puritans, for he loves robustness, noise
quel natural things. His temper is that of
the artists of the Middle Ages: “the men
who carved gargoyles out of jollity, sitting
iiu the sun and drinking ale like brothers.”
Perhaps he himself had laughed heartiest at
(jlie vision of his own adiposity clinging to
tjb.e face of a cathedral, chiselling and per-
spiring in the cheerful sun.

A Belated Biography
i Chance brings into iny hands a volume
entitled David Urquhart (Basil Blackwell),
which is in brief an account of one who died
in 1875 and is now completely forgotten, or
ir remembered at all only as tin? introducer
to England of the Turkish bath. It is a
Curious turn in the whirligig of Fate that
makes the strange revolt in Russia prove how
accurate were the prophecies of this man
nearly a hundred years ago. He travelled
widely in what is in England now called the
Near East and published at least 14 bulky
works about it. the first being “Turkey and
its Resources.” which he wrote in his 28th
year—it ran to five editions. The biography
js surprisingly well done by Gertrude Robin-
son, but some of the facts of interest to the
large clan of Urquharts are omitted.
The clan comes from the north of Scot-
land and is well represented in Inverness,
Banff and Aberdeenshire.' The branch which
owned Meldrum House, Old Meldrum, near
Aberdeen, was considered the head of the
(dan until the owner fell in the fight on tile
jUbara River against the murderers of
General Gordon, when the property passed
into other hands. A younger branch, of
which David was a younger son, were the
owners of Craigston Castle, close by, but
that family during the past few years also
dwindled down to a ’vert to Rome, who died,
leaving the estate to the Catholic Church.
Roth branches had a famous ancestor in the
person of Sir Thomas Urquhart, who is said
to have spoken 16 languages and who
translated the works of Francois Rabelais ;
the French monk’s witticisms still reappear
in edition after edition of Sir Thomas’s
translation. He was a fighter for King
Charles 1.. and on hearing that Charles 11.
was restored ordered a bottle of champagne
to drink a loyal toast, and choked to death
on a grapeseed therein. A merry lot were
the ancestors, if there be any reason to be-
lieve their records. One, Patrick, went forth
to war with 17 of hi : s own sons behind him.
and nine only returned. There is a pretty
little original manuscript now in the hands
of the Scottish Historical Society, dated
October 4, 1457, from King James 11. of
Scotland to William Urquhart, Sheriff of
Cromarty, granting a “remission of ail
action” against him for all “Rapines, Thefts,
Homicide, Fires and Transgressions com-
mitted and perpradated, murther and com-
mon theft only excepted,” which seems as
though William had a fine mediaeval taste
in everyday pastimes.
David Urquhart was born 10 years before
the battle of Waterloo. Being very delicate
as a child, his mother took him to France as
soon as the Napoleonic warfare was over,
and put him to the College of Soreze, which
was famous on account of Lacordaire. Here
he worked from 5 a.m. till 7 p.m., often
studying till midnight and rising at 3 a.m.
He went to St. John’s College, Oxford, but
after matriculating at the age of 16 had 10
leave it for the South of France on account
of his health. He was a friend of Jeremy
Bentham, of King William TV., at the battle
of Navarino held a lieutenant’s commission
in the navy, and finally was appointed First
Secretary in the British Embassy at Con-
stantinople. He became a fierce anti-Rus-
sian and quarrelled with the English Ambas-
sador and with Lord Palmerston, the Premier,
came home again, got into Parliament as
member for Stafford, made friends with the
Chartists, with the result that many joined
him, thundered unceasingly against Russia
and more than any other man brought on
the Crimean War —in fact, was an active
political fighter for nearly 40 years. His
health was never good and he was again and
again compelled to leave England for warmer
climates. As a speaker he had a sort of
magnetism which enabled him to hold large
audiences spellbound for three or four hours.
He was usually right, as witness the de-
nunciations of secret treaties between nations
—treaties which the Great War is said to
have killed at last. But his enemies accused
him of being a megalomaniac, and there
seems to be some ground for the charge.
There is a deal of interest in Urquhart’s
relations with the Chartists, and the names
of some of them —Place, Feargus O’Connor.
Hetherington, Sir Francis Burdett and
others —appear in his biography. His per-
sonal power over most of these men was re-
markable. He made great friends with Karl
Miarx, the socialist leader, and held his
foreign communications in high esteem. In
later years Urquhart made his home at the
Chalet des Melezes in Savoy, and he died at
Naples on his why back from Egypt in 1877.
A remarkable man, very clever and far too
long-sighted to have been successful as a
politician even 50 years ago.
H. H. CHAMPION.
Machine-made Fiction
The new system of building a whole town
of concrete buildings by using the same
moulds for the lot effects an enormous saving
in the cost of construction; yet the designs
are so varied that no two houses in the street
look alike. Every separate building is made
up of parts that are common to all; yet the
individual parts are never put twice in a
similar place. Half the drawing-room wall
of one house is the front kitchen wall of the
next; the bath-room of one becomes a small
t upstairs vestibule in another; and the gable
‘to the east of 45, sth-street, is part of the
north-western end of 69, 31st-street. The
design of a house is no longer a matter call-
ing for thought and original ideas. The
architect simply sits down with the models of
the parts before him and juggles them into
shape like a child putting together puzzle-
blocks.
Something of the same kind is happening-
in popular fiction. Take 50 books and
examine the alleged characters represented
there; and you w T ill find the same types
repeated over and over again by different
authors with only a variation in their rank
and surroundings. Take the situations, the
descriptions, the details of the plots; and
there again the story is almost entirely a
matter of arrangement of material common
to all. Of course, there is the daring novel
with the heroic bigamist and the deeply re-
ligious lady of easy virtue walking in an
atmosphere of purple roses and daffodil
underwear to splendid heights of self-
renunciation and unusual adjective; but pull
the tale apart, set the separate sections out
in classes and compare them with the similar
sections of the wholly respectable romance
about three spinsters and the new' curate.
It will astonish you to find how many of the
parts will dovetail into either book without
altering its apparent tone or individuality.
The minor ornamentation is not always on
a plan, though there also merely mechanical
variation is quite frequently seen; but there
is a lot still to be done with paint and gilding.
This is very valuable for purposes of dis-
guise. The hardest worked female character
in fiction would appear somewhat new if the
author declared that her eyebrows w r ere a
pale green and kept on emphasising the
pallor and the greenness every time the girl
looked in. Similarly the large, rude man—
the vast lout with the bear squeeze and the
silent compressed jaw who has grown so
dear to the factory in its lunch-hour—can be
made to look almost new by a reiteration
of the statement that he wears yellow buttons
on his number 12 boots. Little details fre-
quently repeated save an immense amount
of thought; and a saving of thought in fic-
tion-making is equivalent to a saving of cost
in house-building.
Of course, there is local color. Popular
novelists sometimes go on long journeys with
a notebook and pencil to find this; some-
times they merely sit down with the note-
book and pencil and leave the journey
out. The results are not very different.
The writer who cannot imagine a bit of
local color is not very likely to see it. Charles
Kingsley, on the statement of travellers in
northern South America, wrote better of the
tropical forests before he saw them than
after. But the great advantage of local color
is that it enables a writer to tell an old tale
without even readjusting the different parts.
The same characters can do exactly the same

GEARED-TO-THE ROAD
UNIFORM MILEAGE
The tread with
the cog=like feet
Miller Tyres are geared-to-the-road. Like so many
caterpillar feet gripping the road surface, their
cog-like tread meshes with road depressions,
neutralising shock and ensuring positive full-
powered traction.
The Miller Tread keeps the wheels from spinning
when the car is started. This saves both petrol
and tyres.
THE SPEEDOMETER TELLS THE STORY.
In August, 1917, Mr. C. Marmaduke Deane, of
Sydney, fitted Millers to the rear wheels of his
car. The Speedometer read 5 760 miles. After
travelling 2388 miles (Speedometer 8148) he
changed them to the front wheels.
In July, 1920, the Speedometer (13,796) showed
that the Miller GeaVed-to-the-road Tyres had
covered 8036 miles, having been in continuous
use since 1917. That record needs no comment.

The Bargaining.
I carried my secret through the world.
How the greed through the deference cried
aloud
As over the grasping hands they bowed,
Merchant sly in a dull red gown
With a tight black fez o’er tiie black brow s
frown.
And little bald men of the yellow robe
Where the gold-fish swim in a crystal globe,
Counters of lacquer and sandalwood,
Flattering me, as a buyer should!
Wut never they named a price so high
The secret thing in my soul to buy.
The Persian spread at my feet his mats,
Wonderful woof that a dream had spun.
I smiled, but 1 spurned them every one,
Where the air was heavy with fumes of
spice,
His turban shook as he salaamed twice.
And the diamond merchant, a jet-eyed Jew,
Flashed *me jewels like fire and dew,
Emeralds gfeen as the untrod grass
And he caught at my cloak as x tried to
pass;
For the trade is ever willing to buy
The liiddqn thing with a price too high.
I carried my secret through the world.
One wept for love as he otiered me
A villa down by an opal sea,
A wealth of roses in gardens grey,
A home to rule and a court to sway.
Awhile all humble, awhile all boast —
1 paused to probe, did he want the most
The woman herself or the victory,
Or the pride of solving a mystery?
I carried my secret through the world.
They chinked their coin, but I held it fast
And' cried “ ’Tis mine to the very last,
This secret sealed in my close-locked heart.”
They reached their hands, but I moved
apart,
And some of the hands were brown and
strong,
And some were miserly, lean and long;
And none of the hands were empty, yet
Not one had offered the price I set.
I carried my secret through the world.
There was not even a moon to light
The long black sea in the starless night;
And out on the sands in a silent place
We met and I could not see your face.
As a blind man feels with his finger-tips
I felt your arms and I found your lips.
You did not question, nor yet command,
But I laid my soul in your empty hand.
Carpets woven of rainbow silks,
Rubies heaped in a bright red cone,
Yellow sapphire, or fine white stone,
Filigree of the palest gold—
, A world of barter, the bought and sold,
Gleam in the hot bazaar to-day.
I have naught to sell as I pass that way
And the merchants mutter behind each stall:
“She gave, for nothing, after all!”
For how can a huckster understand _
The price I found in an empty hand?

Bell-birds.
Hear them fluting!
Birds that house
In the shady hollows
Of the leafy boughs,
Wells of summer pleasure
Where a golden finger
Probing hidden treasure
Is enticed to linger.
Hear the tender chiming!
Hear the wild, sweet calling,
Echo after echo
Into silence falling.
All the noontide listens,
Every tree is dreaming.
Quiet water glistens
Through the rushes, gleaming
In a mute enchantment,
On each cadence dwelling,
On the floating magic,
On the aery knelling.
Soft the calm is cloven
By each elfin cry;
It is glamor woven
To a lullaby.
They are priests of slumber,'
Telling silver vows
In the twilight hollows
Of the holy boughs.

Penelope’s Husband.
Before the storm’s furious lashing the waters
are broken
And hunched in great heaps as they thun-
der in terror along;
The lightning’s white flash seems the lash
of a God who has spoken
Too often in patience, and now vents His
wrath in the thong.
Whipped, stung, like a top in the thongs of
the winds of the Ocean
A tiny craft scuttles and scuds through the
thundering waves.
Penelope’s husband is in it, and this is his
potion:
To labor in fear of the Might that he,
laboring, braves.
While, far, in a house near the shore of th£
Ocean that bears him,
Penelope waits for the little craft, flurried
and flung
By the Might that her husband prefers to the
One Thing that 1 scares him—
Penelope waiting, impatient, and icith her
her tongue!

THE BOUNDLESS CHEEK OF
EDWARD GRANVILLE THEODORE.
Premier Theodore, of Queensland, made a
recent pilgrimage outside his own dominion,
in the course of which he strongly advocated
a deviation of the South-to-North (Port
Augusta to Darwin) railway into Theodore
territory. The more closely the transcon-
tinental railway case is examined, the more
like piracy Theodore’s aspirations look.
Ten years ago South Australia handed over
to the Commonwealth 523,620 square miles
of country, of which miles are
blessed with- a yainfall of from 15 to over 40
inches per annum. It might have less than
nothing per annum for all the Commonwealth
has made of it, but that isn’t S.A. s fault.
The State also handed over 624 miles of rail-
way (much more payable than it is now),
which only required completion to be a trans-
continental line cutting across Australia at
its narrowest part and reducing the distance
from South to North by one-half. Nothing
was paid for the 523,620 square miles of
countrv. It was the only birthday present
of importance the Commonwealth ever re-
ceived from a State. But it took over the
debts, mostly incurred in the construction of
the railways and —which was the real con-
sideration —it promised to finish the great
work S.A. had begun, the main clause of
the Act reading thus : —■ ,
To construct or cause to he constructed a iail-
wav in South Australia proper, from any point
on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the
northern boundary line of South Australia proper
to connect with that part of the transcontinental
railway to be built in the Northern Territory from
Darwin southward to the northern boundary of South
Australia proper, and to maintain and work such
railway when constructed.
Thus the Commonwealth was pledged to
spend a large amount of money, though
mostly on its own property, for which it
had received 523,620 square miles of con-
sideration, though not so much money as it
spent on the Ivalgoorlie line, for which it
received no consideration except a strip of
earth to build on and which was on other
people’s property. And straightway most
“respectable” State sharks and politicians and
moral city papers hunted for ways to break
or evade the bargain and divert this money
into their own territory and to their own
profit. All of them proposed to rob the
Territory, and those who were specially
heated over the interests of Melbourne and
Sydney proposed to rob S.A. also.
* * * *
The first of these pirate propositions was
that the railway should not be a real trans-
continental affair at all, but more of a coastal
line, going as straight as possible from Dar-
win into Queensland and then to N. S. Wales
and Victoria, connecting with Brisbane, Syd-
ney and Melbourne, and joining up the
western lines of the first two States. S.A.,
which paid the price for the line, was to be
ignored. Another proposal was that the
line should go from Darwin through Western
Queensland and Western N. S. Wales, and
then wander into S.A. to .save its face. So
the pioneer State wasn’t to be quite ignored,
but the bargain that the line, already built
by S.A. nearly to its northern border, was to
pass out of S.A. across the northern border
was to be torn up. Either scheme was vil-
lainous : yet there are few allegedly high-
minded papers in the East which didn’t (and
don’t) either directly favor the fraud or talk
of it as a matter open to the consideration
of citizens who are still out of gaol.
* * * *
The diversion scheme to which Theodore
lends his support on the other hand has
only this to be said against it: Where the
Act says that the S.A. section of the work is
to connect via the northern border “with
that part of the transcontinental railway to
be built in the Northern Territory” he pro-
poses to read “with that part of the trans-
continental railway to be built partly in the
Northern Territory but very largely iu
Queensland.” It could hardly be what was
meant, as Queensland wasn’t even mentioned
in the agreement. The scheme promises no
special benefit to any State save Queensland,
and it is hardly apparent why the Common-
wealth should go to great expense, and make
great sacrifices in addition, for the sake of a
big country which claims to be rich, or for
love of Theodore. The plan is this :
(1) That at Marreo (S.A.), about 183 miles north
of Port Augusta, on the partially-built transcon-
tinental road, a new line should be started On the
eastern instead of the western side of Lake Eyre,
pointing towards the northern border of S.A., as pro-
vided, but crossing into Queensland and not into
the Northern Territory—into private instead of
public property. This would leave 247 miles of '
the Federal railway no longer part of a main line
but as a purposeless branch ending nowhere, and
a dead loss.
(2) The new line, crossing cheerful places marked
on the map as “stony desert,” would extend for
750 miles through Queensland, to the great improve-
ment of land values and the making of profit gen-
erally for Queensland, and the Commonwealth would
pay for the lot.
(3) Meanwhile, for a similar distance, the Com-
monwealth’s own big property alongside would re-
main undeveloped.
(4) Finally, the line having traversed at the
Commonwealth’s cost about as /touch of Theodore’s
State as it could without falling into the sea, would
traverse as little of the Commonwealth’s land as
it could just to comply with the law, and thus
reach its destination.
* * * *
These arrangements would certainly be
very pleasant for Theodore’s State and a
valuable advertisement for himself. But
apart from the fact that he seems the in-
effable sort of person who would ask for the
British crown jewels if he wanted them and
be scandalised at a refusal, there is no reason
why the Commonwealth should pay this
gigantic bonus. The new line would be
longer than the old one, and to throw away
247 miles of completed work and build afresh
into the stony desert doesn’t look good busi-
ness. The Macdonnell Ranges country would
be left out —a place where rivers (of a sort)
arise and which possesses mineral possi-
bilities. The development of a huge area of
the Commonwealth estate would be aban-
doned. And no capital except Brisbane would
be brought much nearer to the North. The
plea constantly advanced is that the devia-
tion would “link up” with certain Queens-
land lines —in fact it would go at the Com-
monwealth’s expense to meet them instead of
their going at Queensland’s expense to meet
it. But they don’t appear desirable lines to
meet —not while Theodore is alive anyhow,
and responsible for their condition. It
is a common argument that the country in
the old South-to-North survey is a poor pro-
position because the two unfinished bits of
line don’t pay. But on the same reasoning
Western and Central Queensland must be
the abomination of desolation and a howling
waste of dry bones. Some of the figures are
rather behind-liand, but they are complete
for the year up to June 1919 :
Year’s Loss ox the Unfinished Sections of the
Port Augusta-Darwin Federal Railway.
Port August-Oodnadatta . . .. £132,735
Darwin-Katherine River . . . . 79,623
That is in the alleged desert. And this is in
the region which Theodore and his sup-
porters boost as a Garden of Allah or EdeN
with the rose of Sharon and the apples of
the Hesperides as plentiful in it as cactus:
Year’s Loss on Some Queensland Lines with
which it is Proposed to “Link up” by an
Expensive Deviation.
Southern system .. •• .. £738.350
Central system .. . • • • 211,922
Great Northern system .. •• 160,771
These are the systems which stretch furthest
out, so that if Theodore’s deviation idea is
adopted they will be there waiting m the
West —the three nearest deadbeats, ready to
salute the Commonwealth line and show it
how to earn money. The results suggest that
the Queensland west is an awful place, or
else that Theodore is a man of such bad
management that his advice on railway, mat-
ters should be avoided. In other words,
statistics imply that the Commonwealth
railway builders had better stick to the
comparatively solvent route they are on, and
develop their own property, and live in hope
of finding minerals of their own in new ground
away from the partly-worked-out N.Q. fields.
It really isn’t worth while for the Common-
wealth 'to smudge its character with mean
and doubtfully lawful proceedings in order to
deprive itself of 750 miles of its own railway
and get into bad company at the same time.
To fall among thieves is bad, but to become
a thief and fall among oneself is ridiculous.
THE COMPLEX WHICH IS GARDEN.
“Is the working class ready for the change that is
coming? Everybody believes the revolution is with
us. Individualism' and the competitive life are dead.
Things will happen so suddenly that it is essential
that we get ,our machinery in motion now.” — J. S.
Garden, on the occasion of the 'presentation of the
annual report of the Labor Council of N. S. Wales.
such as those quoted above are
being shouted hopefully in many parts of
Australia just now. The speakers all pre-
suppose that the revolution will be an agree-
able affair, and that the death of individual-
ism and competition (which at present,
despite enthusiasts like Mr. .Garden, are
very much alive) will produce the Millen-
nium. It should be superfluous, at this time
of day, to counter the suggestion that a revo-
lution is a pleasant, even a bearable, thing
for those who participate in it. It is war,
with war’s usual horrors doubled or trebled.
But there are prizes worth tremendous sacri-
fices. Anaesthetics, the printing-press, a
certain cure for all forms of cancer, a
method by which venereal disease might be
eliminated from the human race —any of
these would be worth the misery and blood-
shed that revolutionary countries have* to
endure. The question arises : Is the aboli-
tion of nationalism and the substitution in
its place of a governmental system of small
communities, unarmed and hence dependent
on the goodwill of one another and of the
outside world —is this worth the chaos that
Russia has known of late years? It is the
only question really. If the Tory would get
it out of his head that the advocacy of com-
munism or internationalism is a crime, much
heated and confused argument leading no-
where would be .avoided. Burke originated
this proposition in 1790; he claimed that
our forebears having pledged us to uphold
the Constitution, the obligation to do so is
consequently on us for all time. But it is
absurd. If it is better to abandon arma-
ments and parliamentary government and go
back to soviets and inadequate defence, or
none at all, then in the name of eommonsense
and business let us do it. “Go back to
soviets’’ because, as a matter of fact, they
are as old as arquebuses. They belong to
what we call the Dark Ages.

Guildism was Sovietism of a more success-
ful nature than anything which has appeared
in modern Europe. The reason may have
been that the binding force was a religious
sentiment sincerer than the arid creed of
revolution. Anyhow, m scores of centres
throughout England men lived and worked
communistically in town quarters which still
stand, as do the marvellous fruits of their
labors. They were not free, as an Australian
ship-steward or wliarf-lumper understands
the term under Capitalism. They had very
few rights ; fewer even than the conscripted
toilers in the Bolshevik labor trusts. It
was a bleak and prospectless existence on
the whole, but as often as the communists
complained there was some high authority
interested in the completion of the cathedral,
abbey, or what not, who pointed out that this
life was merely a vale of tears and a prepara-
tion- for Paradise. On that understanding
the members of the soviet picked up their
tqols and resumed toil. The mediaeval world
could afford this leisurely and segmented
industrialism, just as the Japanese could less
than a century ago. War was not a national
affair, and neither was trade competition.
There were no airships, battleships or mer-
chant ships. A Kentish craftsman might
live and die without realising that in his half-
century of existence there had been four or
five wars just across the Channel. All sorts
of reasons have been given to explain the
overthrow of the guilds and the coming of
individualism, and not the least convincing
is the theory that the working-classes wanted
the very thing that men of the Garden stamp
claim they will only achieve by reverting to
communism. That is to say, their freedom.
But a very powerful cause was the growing
feeling of nationalism. Men were ceasing to
te simply Devonshire lads, and were becoming
Englishmen. This was partly because their
hereditary enemies, the French, were ceasing
to be Bretons and Normans, and were becom-
ing Frenchmen. The world began to trade
overseas, to discard the old monkish sec-
tionalism, to become individualist and nation-
alist, and finally to arm, because it had little
option in the matter. It was impossible
for the English and the French to live the
perfect industrial life, spiritually speaking,
working in common and harming nobody,
when the Spanish and the Portuguese were
beginning to dream of foreign conquest. Had
the English done so for a little longer the
Spanish Armada would have landed troops
at Plymouth regardless of storms. Austra-
lia is in just that position. In the present
state of world politics it will go back to the
social conditions which England began to
abandon seven centuries ago, at its immediate
peril. There is an Asiatic Spain infinitely
nearer to the Commonwealth than Old Spain
was to England. Its inhabitants have no
use for rechauffes of mediaeval recipes for
achieving the Golden Age. They eat work
as individuals; and their Government has
just allocated haj.f the total revenue to naval
and military defence. Russia, the giant
whom no one has ever thrown, can make the
experiment which Mr. Garden and his kind
are anxious to see made here and survive
nationally. However, the very fact that
the Russians are determined to survive as
nationals proves them impostors as inter-
nationals. There are no true internationals
in the world to-day, and those who advocate
internationalism for weak countries are
simply working for their enslavement.
It is characteristic of the soap-box type of
revolutionary that, while continually calling
on the working classes “t© get ready for the
change that is coming,” and urging them to
“get our machinery in motion now, no con-
structive scheme is ever submitted to put the
proletariat on the alert or get the wheels
turning. Invariably there is a whirl of
words designed to create the maximum of
hatred between class and class, coupled with
suggestions that if the rich are treated as
in Ilussia the poor will be prosperous and
happy. It is a crude appeal to assassina-
tion and robbery in the name of justice and
humanitarianism. The contrast is so mon-
strous that an alienist’s opinion would be
useful in the case of many who draw it.
“How,” asks Edward Holme in The Cos-
mic Commonwealth, ‘‘does a complex cause
insanity?” :
By drawing to itself more than its share of the
man’s thoughts and emotions, and so impairing the
inward harmony of the soul. More especially is this
the case \yhen the complex has a morbid origin,
when it has no right to be a sub-centre, as, for
example, when a man broods over a wrong that has
been done him.
The Gardens of this distracted world spend
three-parts of their time brooding, w’hich is
a very different thing from thinking. They
do not want communism because they be-
lieve it will make the worker richer, freer
and more leisured: its effects wherever it
has lasted any time have always been the
opposite. They call for it in order to haVb
the joy of seeing the wealthy made to suffer.
They do not want disarmament because they
love peace: they hate peace. What they
yearn for is the spectacle of the abhorrent
capitalist being separated from his gold by
a blood-thirsty invader. That will certainly
happen in Australia a short time after the
revolutionary day dawns. However at the
same time as the rich are deprived of their
wealth the poor will be robbed of their lives.
THE GAOLING OF CAPTAIN
GRANGER.
The recent arrest and imprisonment in a
military gaol of- Captain F. G. Granger is
an event which would have stirred freedom-
loving British hearts to fury in the days
before the world was won for freedom. He
was charged with “having been absent from
duty without leave wihile the Commonwealth
was at war.” Technically speaking, Aus-
tralia is still at war. It apparently always
will be —technically speaking. Captain
Granger is one of the 32 Duntroon officers
who have got to realise in the past two
years that peace-soldiering in Australia (or,
as the Hughes Government and the military
authorities style it for punitive purposes,
war-soldiering) is a melancholy imposture.
Most of these young men have had four
years’ training for war, followed by from
three to four years’ service at the Front.
They wete among the officers whom lan
Hamilton alleged to be “worth their weight
in gold.” They have come back to Australia
holding in many cases field rank to find them-
selves required to live, in the Army phrase,
“like officers and gentlemen” on the £275
per annum of a pre-war subaltern. The
work demanded of them is not soldiering:
it is, in fact, wthat was damned in the A.I.F.
as lead-sw T inging. The keenest have to be
loafers because the Army, being practically
non-existent as regards other ranks, there
is nothing for them to do. The signing of
futile memos, at the instance of bored
n.c.o.’s is what now occupies vigorous minds
which once -controlled the movements of full-
strength fighting battalions and even bri-
gades. It is not remarkable that the whole
§2 put in their resignations.
•f. * . * *
Captain Granger was one of the first to
leave Duntroon for the Front, and he was
severely wounded. Many months after the
fighting had ended —palpably for good as
between our late enemies and the British
Empire—he got a chance of a lucrative job
in Adelaide; and failing to get released from
his duties at the II.Q. of a more or less
mythical Victorian infantry brigade, he went
to S.A. without permission, and was there
arrested. Now no one is going to deny that
his conduct was biamable. He had con-
tracted, in consideration of the free educa-
tion and other advantages offered by
Duntroon, to serve in the Australian
Permanent Forces for 12 years. He
was in the wrong, morally, inasmuch as
he broke that contract. However, it might
be pointed out in extenuation: (1) That he
was a minor when he made the agreement :
it is questionable whether any boy of 18
should be allowed to sign away the whole
of the formative years of his life; and (2)
that whatever benefits he got from the coun-
try he has repaid many times over by
his work in the field. Under peace condi-
tions —when, namely, the nation is no. longer
in danger from declared enemies—an
officer is at liberty to resign. If he
commits the offence charged against Captain
Granger he stands only to be placed
under open arrest until he appears before a
court-martial, which, incidentally, can do
no more than dismiss him the service. There
was not a reason in the world save military
arrogance why he should have been haled
across three States by a military guard and
locked up without even the ordinary accused
person’s privilege of seeing visitors. No one
can leave Australia without a passport. He
had not disguised himself or changed his
name in Adelaide. In fact, it was admitted
at his court-martial in Melbourne on Friday
that he liad kept H.Q. notified of every
change in his address right up to his arrest.
When a standing army was first instituted
in England almost any punishment, short of
loss of life and limb, could be summarily
inflicted by the military, whether in peace or
in war, for a.w.1., which in those days, was
indistinguishable from desertion. There
were cases of soldiers who had unauthor-
isedly gone to * the next village, on some
domestic or business matter, suffering years
of penal servitude for it. The excuse was
the same as was proffered in Melbourne last
week- in connection with Captain Granger :
that it was necessary, as our late Allies
say, “to encourage the others.” Under the
Mutiny Act which followed, any offence
savoring of desertion was punishable “by
death, or such other punishment as by a
court-martial should be inflicted”; and no-
thing so scandalised the military mind
or made it feel so hopeless of the future of
the race as the stubborn, hatred felt and
shown bv the English against this measure.
It remained on the Statute Book for about
a* century find three-ouarters. always upheld
by fihe party of reaction and always occupy-


ing in the estimation of the people a status
analogous to that of a bad drain m an other-
wise pleasant locality; but it was not
allowed to extend to the overseas dominions,
it had to be repealed every year it was in
operation, and in 1879 it lapsed or was
cleaned up for ever.
Australia has never been cursed with a
Mutiny Act in application to Australian
soldiers, and it was not under the British
Army Act even during the late war. Assum-
ing the Commonwealth has been at peace
during the past two years, as by every rule
of eommonsense it has, then no military
authority possesses the power to seize Cap-
tain Granger or any other man, drag him
from his civilian calling and immure him
in a military gaol. Assuming the Empire
has not been in danger from the ruined Hun
and ibis abject allies between the time when
they surrendered and now, then a habeas
corpus writ would have been enough to free
Captain Granger within a very few hours
of his incarceration. But it was neces-
sary, as a matter of military politics, to
terrify the other Duntrooners who might have
followed Granger’s example. To meet this
situation a swindle was worked which is
becoming common all over an Empire that
was once the freest the world has known,
a swindle that was perpetrated in England
only a few weeks ago in the case of Lord
Bryce’s sister-in-law. It was claimed that
when Captain Granger went to Adelaide
Australia was “at war.” In other words,
that this officer who had already been re-
turned to Australia as unfit for active ser-
vice—a circumstance which in itself, under
the Regulations, should have caused him to
be retired—might have been required to go
on active service abroad at any moment;
and that his action indicated a craven and
dangerous reluctance to face the embattled
hosts of Prussianism. On this fiction his
rights as a citizen—which he enjoys none
the less from the fact that he is a peace-
time officer—were-taken away, and he was
gaoled without the ordinary criminal’s
privilege of bail for the purpose of attending
to his defence. It is a state of affairs that
the English declined to stand as far back
as Henry IV. ’s reign, in which period the
Curia Regis (the forerunner of our courts-
martial) began to usurp powers greater than
those of the civil courts. How a system
which proved too reactionary for 14th-cen-
tury England should be considered forward
enough for 20th-century Australia is a
mystery that few but the militarists who
are winning the peace for us here can under-
stand.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Political Loot.
The High Commissioner’s salary has been
raised from £5OOO to £6OOO a year, and the
Nationalist dailies, and notably the Sydney
Telegraph, which should know, insist that
the increase has been made for the benefit
of Joseph Cook. If so, it will constitute
one of the most brazen political jobs of the
century. The late Samuel Griffith did
something of the sort on a memorable occa-
sion. But he put a unique mind, at full
strength, into the scale. No one denied that
Griffith was more than worth the added
money, whatever opinions were held as to
his methods of getting it. Cook is one who
has talked and thought platitudes for 40
years, and will do it till he dies —revolu-
tionary platitudes during the less successful
part of his career, Tory platitudes during
the rest of it. He is everything that is con-
sidered dull, undistinguished and un-Aus-
tralian in the place to which he is going. The
blatancy and noisiness of Hughes scan-
dalised Londoners, but, anyhow, he never
bored them; Cook' has actually wearied
Parramatta. It may be argued tliat mental
qualities are not called for in our High
Commissioner; that the last admitted there
was nothing of value to be done by him, and
that W. M. Hughes endorsed the opinion
by sending deputies to do all Australia’s real
work overseas, or by doing it himself. It
is not the custom for the High Commis-
sioner to advertise Australia by entertain-
ing extensively, or for that matter at all.
He can live at Bermondsey if he chooses and
lunch in an A.B.C. shop ; . and in fact Mr.-
Fisher lived something after that frugal
style, to the great advantage of his banking
account. The increase, then, if it has
nothing to do with either social or intellec-
tual qualities, is a tribute to past services.
This suggestion comes unfortunately at a
time when a Melbourne court-martial
has disclosed that about half the Dun-
troon officers who served in the A.I.F.
are anxious to get out of the service and
take their chances in civil life,' because they
can’t live on the pay which the Hughes
Government insists is enough for them. It
is, in part, through the devotion and skill
of these young men that there is a High
Commissioner’s job available at all. If any
future Government decides to dare what a
Government which numbered Mr. Hughes
amongst its most progressive members once
did and organise the land defence of Aus-
tralia on serious lines, then these officers
will again be worth to their country what
they w r ere worth on Gallipoli and in France.
But whether they remain practically unused,
as at present, or whether they are given an
opportunity to do the work they have been
trained for, their remuneration will remain
the same if Hughes, CooK and the rest have
any say in the matter. These gentlemen
haAm saved themselves financially: their
saviours they will not save. If a Duntroon
officer has no right, owing to the financial
disabilities of the country to any increase
at all on five guineas a week (out of which
he is expected to house, feed and clothe him-
self and keep a wife if he is mad enough
to forsake celibacy), then the next High
Commissioner plainly has no right to a
£lOOO a year increase on an income of £lOO
a week; more especially as there is an
almost unlimited number of politicians ready
and eager to take the billet at practically
any figure in reason. What the transaction,
therefore, amounts to is a political ramp
which isn’t even capable of justification.
The taxpayer sees himself penalised, as in
the salary-increase matter, and, worse,
robbed of all confidence in those who have
the handling of his money.
Soviets at Sea,
A bright scheme for ending the marine strike
and replacing it with an unlimited number
of new strikes was evolved last week by
Garden, of Sydney Labor Council, and ap-
proved warmly by the inevitable Walsh, of
the Seamen’s Union. Briefly, the idea was
that the stewards should go back to
work, without being penalised m any
way for the loss and misery they have caused.
Then the shop or job committees which
already exist are to be enlarged and re-
organised, the stewards and all hands being
represented. When a ship is ready to go to
sea the committee is to present sudden ‘■de-
mands” and unless they are granted the crew
won’t take the vessel to sea and no other
crew will be allowed to. The committee is to
enjoy “full local autonomy,” and the vessel
will be a floating republic on which every-
body will have a vote except the owners,
passengers and presumably the officers. It
will be hardly worth while taking passengers
and freight, especially at a fixed rate, on
board a vessel which will only start by
accident and on terms that won’t be known
till the last moment, but which may even in-
clude a half or whole interest in everything
from truck to keelson. Presumably the idea
is that suspense and uncertainty and the
constant dropping that wears away a stone
will in some way lead to the stealing of the
ships. However, if that end is achieved they
will belong, not to the men afloat even to the
extent they do now, but to the union bosses
ashore, and prompt obedience will be exacted
as it i.s at present when a strike command is
issued, or when the Caucus orders a member
to come to heel or be expelled. The individual
who looks askance at the new skipper will
not only go out of the ship but out !of the
union and out into the social and industrial
wilderness. Labor bosses are poor payers
and hard taskmasters, as was found by
(among others) Con Wallace, the dupe who
gave away his sure Federal seat to Ryan
and was rewarded with a very minor job and
wages cut down to the least the law would
permit. Plainly, if this scheme for “taking
over” the ships should come off the floating
soviets are likely to be run on the best avail-
able imitation of Leninism. The baser sort
of Russians are enduring that tyrannous
system with difficulty: it is unlikely that free
Australians would stand it, in the developed
form which is proposed, even for a sufficient
period to allow the economic fallacies lurking
in the background to be exposed.
+
A Legal Convention Which Encourages
Illegality.
In the Brisbane District Court, the other
day, two youths were charged with stealing.
Taylor declared that when lie told the constable
he knew nothing of the matter the latter punched
him in the face and caught him by the throat, and at
Pinkenba Police Station another constable punched
him. Rice stated that he received very much similar
treatment.
After it had been established that one of the
constables had already been reported for
violence to a prisoner the Judge commented
adversely on the behavior of the policemen,
and the jury brought in a verdict of Not
Guilty. Rightly or wrongly an impression
was left behind that the third degree had
been used. The suspicion was the more
readily created because most people know that
third-degree methods have become common
throughout Australia of late years. It is
the logical and inevitable outcome of the
practice of allowing policemen to privately
examine prisoners and subsequently depose to
the result. Wherever counsel can produce
evidence reasonably suggestive of the fact
that this Yankee method of extorting a con-
fession has been employed his client is safe.
Which is a fair measure of the general
abhorrence of it. The first step to reform is
to entirely prohibit the examination of
prisoners by the police; and the next to
decree that no communications between police
and accused shall be given in evidence. See-
ing, however, that the object of criminal in-
vestigation is the detection and punishment
of crime and the exculpation of ttie innocent
there is no reason why examinations of
suspects should be barred altogether. W hat
is needed is tlfat they should be conducted
in circumstances which make terrorism im-
possible. A provision that examinations
should in all cases be made by specially
qualified magistrates, sitting in open court,
would effect this. The accused would be
bound to answer the questions, so. it might
be advisable to allow .him the assistance of
counsel. On the other hand, counsel’s rights
would be limited to seeing that the proceed-
ings were correctly recorded, that the
accused understood the questions, and that
his answers were correctly transcribed.
Theoretically the law is most sensitive on
this phase of an accused person’s rights, as
is indicated by the magistrate's attitude on
committal. The act commands him to say:
“Having heard the evidence do you wish to
say anything in answer to the charge? Y r ou
are not obliged to say anything unless you
desire to do so, but whatever you say will
be taken down in writing and may be given
against you in evidence at your trial.” After
which the cadi has to “inform the defendant
and give him clearly to understand that he
has nothing to hope from any promise of
favor and nothing to fear from any threat
which may have been holden out to him to
induce him to make any admission or con-
fession, but that whatever he then says may
be given in evidence against him upon his
trial notwithstanding such promise or
threat.” The caution is comprehensive
enough. But it is absurd, inasmuch as it is
only given after one, two, or perhaps a dozen
policemen, either separately or in mobs, have
privily catechised the accused and related to
the Bench their version of the secret in-
quisition, or as much or as little of it as
they think expedient.
A Word for Ireland.
H. B. O’Hagan (late R.F.C.) releases his
cargo:—
“J.E.” (B. 20/I/’2l) in the role of “Embittered
Scot,” makes a rare lot of mis-statements about
Ireland for the space he fills.
He speaks of her as “our worst enemy’s [Germany]
friend.” That is a propagandist phrase worthier of
a Castle cable-framer than of an enlightened com-
mentator. Let us see how'lreland’s “friendship for
Germany expressed itself. Statisticians who have
gone carefully into the figures are of opinion that in
the first two years of the war Ireland did consider-
ably better than Australia, and that in proportion
to population Ireland had only to provide 235,000
recruits to equal Australia’s 350,000. This she did —
not in five years, but in three. By the end of 1917
Ireland (according to Sir Auckland Geddes, Minister
for National Service) had contributed 170,000 men
to the Imperial Army, not including 22,000 in the
British Army when the war began, and 30,000
reservists who were called up, making a total of
222,000. To this can be added 80,000 who had
volunteered and were rejected—a total of over
300,000 “friends” of Germany. And that by 1917 1
If we allow for the difference of population (Aus-
tralia has about 600,000 more people than Ireland),
the higher percentage of old-age pensioners in Ire-
land (total 198,938), the higher death-rate and the
lower proportion of Irishmen between 20 and 40,
the astonishing thing is that Ireland did so well.
And no mention is made of the thousands of Irishmen
in Australia, M.L., Canada and U.S.A. who fought
with the forces of their respective countries and
helped the common cause. “J.E.’s” reckless state-
ment that Ireland was Germany’s friend may have
bee.i based on the recent ex parte statement of the
British Government (inspired by Carson, Smith and
Bonar Law) that “Sinn Fein was hand-in-glove with
the Hun.” Neither Colonel Repington (“Times”
military correspondent) nor General Sir Bryan
Mahon, 0.-in-C. in Ireland, concurred in this view,
and, according to Repington’s diary, Mahon in May
1918 informed Lord French of his scepticism—
and he was in a better position to know than most
people. On the other hand we know this, from a
cable which arrived a week ago: that the Irish
response to a German call to arms against the Allies
was 52 recruits.
Because Roger Casement, a Protestant Irishman
and ex-civil-servant, turned traitor, all Irishmen
are tarred with the same brush. Which is as much
as to say that all Englishmen are traitors because
Aubrey Stanhope, the renegade' English gentleman,
became Germany’s ardent champion and edited an
anti-British journal in Berlin. Or because Houston
Chamberlain, another Englishman of position, turned
pro-Hun.
“Scotland,” says “J.E.,” “supplied many English
Prime Ministers and Ireland supplied only its petted,
potted grievance.” The reason is that ever since
Ireland was granted representation in the Commons
the Irish members have consistently refused io
accept office in any British Government, as their
presence in the English Parliament was a standing
protest against a form of government imposed on
their country against the will of its people and by
force jOf arms.' The record of Irishmen as adminis-
trators and statesmen in other parts of the world is
sufficient answer to “J.E’s.” sneer.
Finally, “J.E.” refers to Father O’Donnell as an
Irish cleric. As “J.E.” knows, or should know, he
is no more an Irish cleric than Henley is. He is
an Australian born and reared, and as such is surely
entitled to love the land of his fathers. In the
Conscription campaigns and on the battlefield he did
his share, and, after all, that was the acid test
of his love for Australia. As for the “blazing
ingratitude for hospitality received,” the shoe is
on the other foot. If their love for this fair land
is sincere (as I am sure it is), “J.E.” and others
should be grateful to the present generation of
Irish-Australians if only because they are the
descendants of those sturdy pioneers, exiled from
their homeland, who have helped to make Australia
the great country she is, and whose blood and spirit
are in some degree responsible for that touch that
made the Digger famous —and the envy of most
other armies.
In a word, it is laudable in Australia to love
one’s native land, if one is a Pole, Slav, Chink or
Hottentot; but for an Irish-Australian to love the
land of his fathers is a criminal act worthy of the
most opprobrious censure.
The Coining of Cocky.
The Country-party movement, in some
respects the most significant political de-
velopment of the decade, had its origin in
Westralia. It arrived in that State at the
general election of 1914, and has made such
progress that, with a reasonable allotment
of luck and tact, there will be an Agrarian
Government in otlice attgr the Mareu pleb-
iscite. When the Assembly closed down
the Country Party held IS seats in a
House of 50. The Official Laborites
had 15, the National Liberals 11, the
National Laborites five, and there was one
Independent Labor man—he generally voted
with, but has been disowned by, the Official
Labor group. In the light, of the Kalgoorlie
Federal contest, there is no prospect of Phil
Collier’s party being returned with a
majority. It may wrest two seats from the
other Labor faction and two or three from
the Liberals, but if it comes back 20 strong
it will have done well. Nor have the Lib-
erals any earthly hope of regaining their old
ascendancy in March. They were greatly
weakened in the last Parliament by seces-
sions to the predominant partner, and they
will go to the country with the dismal cer-
tainty that further trouble is in store for
them. Theirs is a party without a future,
and with no particularly glorious past, and
although the Maiion incident has prolonged
the existence of the National Labor faction,
its expectation of life is not great. The
present Ministry is composed of four Lib-
erals and four members of the Country
party. Manifestly the Liberal element is
over-represented, and even if the alliance
survives the election, one of the Liberal
Ministers will have to step down in favor
of a C.P. man. But Cocky’s obvious policy
is to make it easy for Mitchell and
George —both represent rural constituencies
—and other sympathetic Liberals and Na-
tional Laborites to come over, as Lefroy and
Scaddan have done. If this can be arranged
—and it should not be difficult —Westralia
will have a Government independent of city
interests, and that will be something new
in this Commonwealth of exorbitant coastal
capitals. And the experiment is worth
trying. A truly rural Ministry couldn’t be
worse for Westralia than some past tribu-
lations, and it might be a lot better. At
the worst it would represent a protest, how-
ever blind and inarticulate, against the fool-
policy which has crowded nearly half the
population of the continent into five huge
parasitic cities. And the experience would
be useful to Cocky as well as to Westralia.
It would take him out of his brooding con-
centration on the crop and the cow-pad-
dock. It would compel him to realise that
man, considered as a political being, does
not live by bread and butter alone. Of
course, Labor, in its own fashion, is just
as depressingly materialistic as Cocky. In
fact, the great need of each of these parties,
to which the political future of Australia
belongs, is a soul —or some efficient substi-
tute, 'if there is any such.
A Financial Boilermaker in London.
The explanation given for John Storey’s
long and costly visit to London is naturally
a financial one. The bill falls due so often now
that the need for a three days’ air service
to London becomes overwhelming. There
are sums variously estimated at from
£50,000,000 to £70,000,000 falling due in Eng-
land and Australia within the next few
years. The idea of such big doings, and the
vision of an inexpert man dabbling among
them, is calculated to give the community a
cold sensation behind its food. John Storey,
though a Premier, has never held the
Treasurer’s portfolio or any other portfolio.
He has been in office only about 10 months
in very unimproving company. His private
occupation, when he had one, gave him no
chance to learn high finance. He hasn’t
lived among financiers; such folk don’t herd
at Balmain. He goes to London strong in
his innocent conviction that “it is easy to
govern a country if one is honest,” oblivious,
seemingly, of the fact that the persons he
meets in London may not be honest. No
more unsophisticated-looking countryman
ever went there on a bigger errand at a
worse time, for it is a day of slump and
disillusionment, and the harassed and war-
worn and hard-up hub of finance is talking
10 per cent. now. The Storey Government
has already smitten or touched London for
£6,500,000 of new loans insidd six months, and
it notoriously wants more new loans, so its
credit is unusually threadbare. It doesn’t offer
to pay off out of savings a big part of the
bill falling due, as Victoria recently did", in
fact it has nothing to pay with except a
record half-year’s deficit. Its difficulty with
its local borrowing and the record of its'
Three Mad Bills —Profiteering, Lands and
Rent —have given it a dissipated, rakish air
which even the Premier’s stolid front and
Pickwickian spectacles will hardly counter-
act. Its lavish raising of its own salaries are
poor advertisements, and so are its proposed
Motherhood Lottery, the repudiation policy
of some of its supporters whom it dare not
sack, and the stop-work policy of its irre-
sponsible masters. Still, despite the need for
a swift air service, the most urgent affair in
London, unless a reckless effort is being made
to raise new money to find jobs for the un-
employed and others, is a sum of about
£7,000,000 which has to be repaid there next
year. There was no need to send any elderly
and inexperienced but beaming person to
gambol, like Daniel the prophet, among the
lions of a famine-stricken’ money-market over
a matter that is still 12 or 18 months ahead.
The position could hardly grow worse for wait-
ing. If the Premier, to justify his existence,
also starts providing for renewals for 1923,
when £2.000,000 falls due, and 1924, when
nearly £17,000,000 is repayable in a lump
—and these things are suggested—he will
probably be buying money needlessly and
prematurely on top of a panicky market and
on the strength of the worst reputation that
any N. S. Wales Ministry ever sent to Eng-
land for inspection. What the Ma State
really wants at present is not the trusting
head of a very stony Government viewing
with surprise the Tower of London and the
Waxworks and the Zoo. The demand is for
a disillusioned financier in Sydney with a
hard resolve that by the time the £7,000,000
loan falls due at least half the money will
have been saved out of the wonderful
£30,000,000 revenue or raised by lottery or
got together any old how, and that the public
credit will be good enough to prevent the
children on whom Minister McGirr pastes
his sordid advertisement being outrageously
fleeced over the other half. In the brief space
1921-2-3-4 the State has about £12.000.000
falling due in Australia and £26,000,000 in
London, and in addition some milllions of
oddments—cadged trust funds, floating over-
drafts and sundries —falling due all over the
office. It has never been in such a situation
before, nor has it ever before been so short
of money and reserve taxing power, and never
before has it had to rely on quite such an
irresponsible, self-indulgent crowd of frivol-
lers to deal with the case. As regards the
£26.000,000 in London, ht all events, N. S.
Wales, in the absence of the slightest pro-
vision for the redemption of the pawn-ticket,
must accept the best terms its persuasive
boilerman can get for it. The chief hope
stems to be that the creditor even in_ his
worst moods will never ask for more than
all the people have got, for fear of getting
nothing.
Coddling the Plutocrat.
The Queensland Government poses as an
essentially Anti-Fat combination. By word
of mouth and through its subsidised press it
has cursed the money-lending capitalist unto
seventy times seven. Men who put their
means into War Loan were abused as “Four
and a half per cent. Shylocks,” and it was
hinted a day was coming when the obliga-
tions of the State towards these gentlemen
might have to be thrown overboard. If
one thing was made clear it was that the
Queensland Labor Government was the
sworn foe,of Capitalism in all its sorts and
shapes and sizes, and that any attempt at
coddling the Fat Man would meet with in-
stantaneous execration. Consequently it comes
as a double shock to find that this Govern-
ment has passed a ukase to the effect that a
man with an income of £6500 per annum from
an investment is to be exempt from the tax-
ation which presses so heavily on the man who
has only his hardly-earned £6OO per annum.
The plutocrat with his handsome £l2O a
week coming in is singled out as being the
one who needs relief from The imposts of a
period of unprecedentedly burdensome taxa-
tion, while at the same time ever-increasing
land and income taxes are levied on men
whose income is not one-fourth of that
amount. If Ephraim Goldstein approach
Treasurer Fiiielly at the present moment
and offer that politician £IOO,OOO in return
for bonds in the present 6-J per cent, loan,
then Treasurer Fiiielly will lift Goldstein
out from among them who groan under in-
come-tax and super-tax. It matters not what
calamity overtakes the land —drought, floods,
earthquakes or war; this gilt-edged pet is
to remain untouched, and the Brisbane
Trades Hall looks on approvingly. For in
the bright lexicon of Queensland Socialism
it is a thrice-accursed thing to make £2OOO
a year out of any developmental enterprise,
but thrice-blessed to make £6OOO or £IO.OOO
per annum out of the taxation of a land

that is rapidly bleeding to death. What
has happened to that immortal principle
so often mouthed from a hundred Labor plat-
forms about “putting the taxation on the
shoulders of those best able to bear it”? Do
Theodore and Fihelly think that people
whose salaries run from £SOO to £ISOO form
the class in their State best able to bear
taxation? What claim has this £6OOO per
annum gold-bug to all this coddling and
cuddling and .special consideration? What
claim, that is to say, apart from this —that
he furnishes Ministers with the means to
continue that corruption of the electors upon
which they depend for their political exist-
ence.
Tammany in Two Cities.
“Jarraii” : The Bulletin’s remarks about
Tammany in Sydney remind me that the
New York institution of that name is suffer-
ing from one of its periodical visitations of
unpopularity. The New York correspondent
of London Daily News, a paper friendly
to Labor and Ireland (both Tammanies are
noted for their emotional, but somewhat
irrelevant, sympathy with Ireland), refers
to the regrettable incident thus:—
The housing and building scandal in New York is
an event that develops daily. Organised Labor
staggers under the disclosure that, in one year,
Brindell, the union official, received in dues and
bribes and blackmail a known 500,000 dollars, apart
Pom whatever may be unknown. Major Hylan is
shown to be heavily involved, at least by collusive
carelessness, and every local taxpayer, as I know
to my cost, is paying enormously increased rates to
meet the bill. As long as Labor is guilty of corrup-
tion on a scale so colossal as this, involving six
million people in domestic loss and distress, it is
useless to argue for the closed against the open shop,
or even to discuss the right of combination in terms
customary to the British.
Since Bobs Tweed reigned in the ’seventies
similar explosions of popular fury have
occurred at intervals. In 1870 Tweed, by
methods curiously resembling those of Syd-
ney’s Municipal Labor party, made himself
master of New York. He had the same fond-
ness for “discipline” and secrecy, he was a
sturdy democrat of the sort that is apt to
grow maudlin about the wrongs of Ireland,
and he had strong views about the right of
the 10-minute resident to vote. What followed
Tweed’s advent to power is described by the
Encyclopaedia Britannica :
A system of official plunder then began which has
had few' parallels in modern times. How much was
actually stolen can never be known; but the bonded
debt of the city, which was 36,000,000 dollars at
the beginning of 1809, was 97,000,000 dollars in
September, 1871, and within the same period a float-
ing debt of 20,000,000 dollars was incurred, making a
total of 81,000,000 dollars. For that vast sum the
city had little to show. The method of plunder
was the presentation of excessive bills for work
done. The bills were ostensibly paid in full, but
in reality only in part, the rest being retained by
Tweed and divided among his followers in proportion
to their importance. The total cost of the court-
house to the city was many times the cost of con-
struction. The amount paid in two years for the
city printing and stationery was nearly 3,000,000
dollars. The end came through a petty quarrel over
the division of the spoils.
Sydney has not achieved the usual Tammany
scandal—yet/ However, given a ruling
clique that derives its power from irrespon-
sible electors, that wants lodgers of a
month’s residence to be given the vote, that
decides things by secret caucus, that doesn’t
allow its members the right of private judg-
ment, that bars the press from deputations
to the Mayor, that was with difficulty re-
strained from paying £75,000 for an undevel-
oped hole in the ground, and that yearns to
involve the reluctant ratepayers in schemes
costing millions, remarking passionately,
when questions of finance are raised, “that
the money must be got somehow” —given all
these factors, there is no telling what may
happen.
Ashworth on Hughes.
In Melbourne one recent day Secretary Ash-
worth of the Employers’ Federation made a
few remarks, the burden of which was that
“the head of the Commonwealth is a born
spendthrift.” To this very mild attack on
Hughes Treasurer Joseph Cook replied, for
Australian politicians are strangers to the art
of silent and dignified indifference, largely
practised by bloodhounds, St. Bernards and
Great Danes, but unknown to the small
prowling dog that keeps irregular hours. Yet
Ashworth spoke only one-tenth of the truth
or less. Quite a large proportion of the
allegedly serious politicians of to-day, includ-
ing such men as Hughes. Pearce, Holman,
Scaddan and others, were reared in an
atmosphere of blast and blither, circulating-
round the destruction of capital and industry,
the nationalisation of everything regardless
of expense, the raising of everybody’s wages,
the borrowing and spending of all that could
be laid hands on, a veiled contempt for
national obligations (the capitalist who takes
up our loans being an enemy with whom no
one need keep faith in any lavish fashion),
a hazy sympathy with the brotherhood of
men (especially foreign men other than com-
petitors in the wage field) and voluble fever-
ishness and unrest in general. (Joseph
Cook! is something of an exception, for he
took his limited abilities out of the Labor
narty before it was the drunken vicious pro-
digal it afterwards became and didn’t
quite learn the art of making every day
an All Fools’ Day). The only reason
why Hughes, Holman and co. are
not to-day in the same camp as Theo-
dore of the busted nine-million loan, and
McTiernan of the crazy Profiteering Bill, is
that they were pushed out. The drunken
crew ejected these captains for beinsr only
half-drunk, and it was to their credit that they
weren’t any worse. However, their only
partially “swiped” condition was no reason
why they should get command of sober men’s
ships. They got command because they were
brought up in an academy which, though it
didn’t teach either the value of economy or
the virtue of solvency, was a whale at the
kind of tricky organisation which builds up
parties and collects votes. They were
“Parliamentarians.” But their change of
sides didn’t mean that they were born again
or went to school again to unlearn their past.
Nobody could imagine any body of men, such
as the policy-holders of the A.M.P. Society,
appointing any of them to manage or sub-
inanage or deputy-manage or even cashier the
institution. No one could picture any of

them being appointed to control any concern
which had to float without taxes or loan
funds to stop the leakages. Now the Aus-
tralian Government mechanism isn’t a de-
bating society like the U.S. Congress, but one
of the most comprehensive and inclusive uni-
versal provideries on earth, including all sorts
of activities from a transcontinental railway
and a merchant fleet down to meatshops,
pubs, joineries and quarries. Also it is a
gigantic loan and discount co. and a
benevolent asylum. Yet it falls more and
more into the hands of men of the Hughes
class, for whom there is no cure except death
or removal to some dignified sphere where
they will never see money or hear about
monetary affairs. They haven’t the glimmer-
ing of an idea of their own deficiencies any
more than Adam in his unawakened state
knew that he lacked a bathing costume. The
only thing that is really wrong with Ash-
worth’s description of Hughes is its
courteous inadequacy.

A Proposed New Stratum of
Legislatures.
As dear to the fossil soul as the House of
Peers itself is the inviolability of the five
huge . political estates which sprawl their
mismanaged bulk over Australia. Labor
fossils, who despise the House of Peers but
reverence the peerage of the Trades Hall,
apparently love these hulking properties just
as much as the older type of Tory. So both
crowds put “decentralisation” on their pro-
grammes and leave it there, haunted end-
lessly by uneasiness lest the thing should
come. Whenever the menace looks more
acute than usual, professed decentralising
papers like the S. M. Herald and Mel-
bourne Age begin to utter words of warn-
ing or discouragement. The Herald simply
warns, but the Age, which professes to have
some constructive instincts, is now agitating
for a complicated lumpy scheme of compro-
mise to divert attention. The idea is to set
up a new terrace of “councils,” intermediate
between existing layers of administration—
something that won’t be exactly man or
precisely beast or bird, and is free from
the suspicion of being fish. About 15 of
these, it is suggested, would be enough for
Victoria —enough, anyhow, to draw a red-
herring across the track of thought—and
presumably the other States could have as
many as they liked. Thus there would be
four layers of government quite apart from
the Imperial connection —the municipal or
local government bodies, the drove of new
“councils,” the State Legislatures and the
Commonwealth Parliament. The reason
assigned for establishing this herd of anom-
alies, instead of simply cutting Victoria into
three and N.S.W. into four or five, is
expressed thus: —
As for a .new State, the suggestion goes straight
in the teeth of present-day Australian sentiment.
Meaning, of course, One Big City senti-
ment manufactured by the Five Big 'City
papers:—•
It would mean the duplication of vice-regal sym-
bols, social formalities, departments and officials.
The Commonwealth has seven vice-regal sym-
bols now —seven for 5,000,000 people. In
the general revision of things, when the five
continental States are increased to 15 or
20, with power to add to their number,
patriotic folk hope to get down to one vice-
regal .symbol, which is the number in Canada
and the South African Union. The others
would be local deputies, no more vice-regal
than mayors. The title would simply be
Governor—if not “Gov.” In the U.S. there,
are 48 of these officials —roughly one to efvch
2,000,000 people. Many of them are
neither social or formal —yet they answer.
Australia could quite easily support 15 or 20
such men to supervise as many small legisla-
tures. But that is not the Age's idea at
all. It wants to abolish nothing of the Com-
monwealth’s existing vice-regal pomp and cir-
cumstance, but to superimpose on it a new
stratum of splendor and expense. The
effect would be to leave the old State boun-
daries unchanged and the superfluous vice-
regalities still superfluous. The Parliaments
in the Few Big Cities would still control rail-
ways, ports and harbors and all the things
which make the Big Cities such bloated con-
cerns in proportion to the surrounding empti-
ness. It is not decentralisation: it is not
even sense, and it is only in a country gone
crazy with over-indulgence in loan money
that sijch a proposition could be seriously put
forward.
Britain, America and Japan are all contri-
buting to the vague and futile talk of the
nations about the limitation of armaments •
and in the meantime Japanese military
experts are openly discussing the prospects
of a scrap with America. Among others,
one Kojiro Sato, a Lieutenant-General, has
been weighing the possibilities of an Ameri-
can invasion in a series of articles in the
Tokio Hociii. On figures, he admits, Nippon
is no match for Jonathan in point of mili-
tary strength, but he banks largely op her
inaccessibility, and says that “even if Japan
had no navy it is highly improbable that
any foreign country could land troops on
her shores, however strong that foreign coun-
try might be.” But Japan has a navy, and
he calculates that it would seriously harass
American bases—like Guam and the Philip-
pines. He goes on :
Even if they succeeded in landing all classes,
young and old, would unite against the invaders, and
it is unthinkable that they could hold the conquered
territory for any length of time. The American
troops would find the greatest difficulty in resisting
the Japanese, and it is probable that they would
ultimately be compelled to evacuate by the almost
insuperable difficulties attending the transportation
of munitions.
Sato ends with a remark that should make
Australia prick up its ears:—
Putting Japan in the place of America she would
not shrink from waging war in the face of these
difficulties, but I do not think that America can
summon up the courage to disregard these obstacles
and send an expedition to a country so far removed
from her as Japan.
What Lieutenant-General Sato says of
the difficulties of the invasion of Nippon
applies exactly to the invasion of Aus-
tralia, from the Japanese point of view;
yet we have his word for it that “Japan
would not shrink from waging war in the
face of those difficulties.” And in the mean-
time, there comes a cable that “the Japanese
•Government is planning a revision of the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance which will free
Japan from its obligations.”
A plaint from the Far North :• —
One of the several tragic comedies of the Northern
Territory is the Aboriginal Department. All the
32 police are protectors of abos. and receive extra
pay as such. Thus Darwin has eight of them.
The managers of Government stations are also paid
protectors. A protector gets £4OO a year, an
allowance for his wife and free housing and free
rations, his total cost being roughly £BOO per
annum, and the special qualifications for the posi-
tion are precisely nil. Now consider some happen-
ings of the past three months:—
Two abos. found dead alongside some cans on
railway property; water in cans contained arsenic.
They were not protected in any way. The nigs,
had been dead over two months when found. There
was no inquest.
Two young half-easte girls enticed from their
homes by white men. The whites were charged with
getting the girls to leave their employment and
fined £ 6 each !
Half-caste woman and her husband made serious
charges against a protector. At the time of writing
the case had not been brought before a court nor any
►inquiry held.
Anyone who suggests that some kind of law should
be enforced in the interests of these unfortunates
has the whole community against him, or much of
it, and the Department, south. We have a strong
man as a Judge who deals drastically with offenders
against abos. when he gets a show, but it is only
extreme bad luck that lands anyone before
him, and even then if it is a jury case no anxiety
need be felt by the accused. Weakness here and want
of knowledge of N.T. conditions in Melbourne are to
blame; and as such conditions . inevitably act and
re-act on one another, the social outlook for our abo.
brother is almost as dark as his skin.
“Quirk” on a withered Arm : —-
I recently attended an Aero Club meeting com-
posed principally of ex-flying officers, many of whom
I knew on the other side for efficient pilots and
instructors. They are still keen; but each, on
being asked if he would care to take up a “fighting
’bus,” replied: “No, not straight off. I’d want a
‘try-out’ first.” They have all (or nearly all) lost
their “touch.” If the Defence Department intends
to let all this priceless flying personnel become ineffi-
cient through non-association with the tools of their
trade, it is going the right way about it. And
once gone the asset can never be replaced, while
the officers’ experience in the greatest school of all
—actual warfare —must be lost to the new genera-
tion of flying men. As to their fitness, their pres-
ence in Australia is enough guarantee of that. The
aerial arm proVed the truth of Darwin’s rule more
conclusively than any. The Defence Department
officials should lose no time impressing on the
Government the necessity of immediately instituting
some system whereby this unique material can he
saved for Australia. The establishment of school
aerodromes where pilots could occasionally get their
hands on a “joy-stick” would go a long way towards;
the desired end. It may mean nothing that Japan,
according to a cable which arrived last week, '“is
concentrating on the training of fliers under Euro-
pean instructors with war experience.” On the
other hand it may mean a lot.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Right up to the hour of his departure N. S.
Wales Premier Storey lost few opportunities
of assuring all and sundry that his party
would never repudiate the public debt. Too
much protestation is a mistake. When a
lady stands in the middle of the street pro-
testing that she is a lady one begins to
suspect for the first time that she isn’t.
By 16,000 votes to 10,000 the A.W.U.
has declared in favor of arbitration as
against strike. It is one sign of returning
sanity, for a desperate attempt has been
made to drag the shearers’ union over to
Direct Action, and some of the liberated
I.W.W. prisoners, who owe their freedom
largely to the A.W.U., have been foremost
in the frenzy. In his presidential address,
Arthur Blakeley, M.H.R., declared solidly
against the general-strike lunatics and the
other maniacs “whose dearest desire is to
see the streets flowing with blood” —but not
their blood. “Ballots are better than bul-
lets,” said Blakeley. Lincoln made the same
remark 60 years ago, but it can do with
repetition.
A constant worry to a Cabinet with a
microscopic majority is the pained voice of
Austin Chapman, M.H.R.. braying about
“the scandalous neglect of Canberra.” Aus-
tin has been more or less vocal about his
chronic grievance since the Reps, went into
recess, but the other day an extra roar
startled the Cabinet out of its lethargy,
and two Ministers and an Advisory Com-
mittee were hurriedly ordered to go out
to the capital and choose sites for a hostel
and a hall. Chapman is now calmer, and
his temperature has gone down, but the dark
suspicion that the Government is Going Slow
is liable to bring him to his feet in a condition
of bleating ferocity at any moment.
When putting in a word for the National-
ist candidate at the Goulburn (Vie.) by-
election the other day, Premier Lawson col-
lapsed and had to be hurried to the seaside
for a spell. Lawson is a hard worker, but
his powers , are unduly tried by the load of
Ministers whom he has to think for and
help through administrative difficulties.
Peacock and Robinson, of course, need no
nursing, but one or two others of Lawson’s
colleagues can make life a burden to a will-
ing man. Lawson, by the way, is credited
with Federal ambitions, and if Hughes drops
out the Vic. Premier will make a big endea-
vor to get the Nationalist' nomination for
Bendigo.
After he had exhausted the salary possi-
bilities of the job, Andrew Fisher frankly
admitted that he didn’t see much use for
a hugely-paid High Commissioner in London.
There is almost always a Federal Minister
in London doing the work, if there is any
work, and, anyhow, the run-to-seed, down-at-
heel institution has got to such a pass that
there is hardly a man on its staff who has
ever seen Australia, or takes the trouble to
know anything about it. so no work is done.
Therefore, most people will agree with
Fisher. But another ambassadorial loafer
follows, all the same.
From a man who knew Jacob: —
A mild and inconspicuous old man was Jacob
Stumm, who died at Gympie (Q.) last week. He was
M.H.R. for Lilley (Q.) from 1913 to 1917, and sat in
the State Parliament before that, and I cannot re-
member his making a speech that was given more
than a couple of lines in the dailies, or was not
ticked off with the fatal “Mr. Stumm also spoke.’’
But I recall an awful night in the Reps, when Stumm,
sitting forlornly through a dead debate, became the
subject of a limerick competition that had been
improvised to end the boredom of three virtuous
scribes. I forget the actual words, but one of
the geniuses dealt with Stumm in a manner some-
thing like this: —
There was an old person named Stumm,
Who was canny, peculiar and glum ;
But one night he grew kindly,
And, acting quite blindly,
Gave the poor baggage-usher a “thrum. ’
The allegation that Stumm never tipped the baggage-
usher who carted inter-State members’ luggage to the
railway station caused the verse to be disqualified
on account of the “hyperbolical absurdity’’ of the
last line. But later on we came to know Stumm
better, and found him rather a benevolent old chap.
THE FISHERMAN, THE BOTTLE AND THE GENH.
A light and airy politician stands revealed
in this telegram from Westralia:
In his pre-election policy speech at Northam
the Premier, Mr. Mitchell, claimed that his policy
is gradually reducing the deficit, which would be
under £400,000, as against £668,000 for the
previous year.
Mitchell, who has got rid of quite a swag
of shortage by adding it to the permanent
debt, doesn’t mean by the above that he has
paid off £268,000, but that he is going to
the dogs for another £400,000, making
£3,065,000 for two years. He is in the posi-
tion of the man whose character is rapidly
improving because he only means to commit
four murders this year, whereas last year
he committed six.
The two simultaneous monarchs of Sparta
weren’t a circumstance to the double-
barrelled Ministries which Labor has lately
evolved in Australia. There is the osten-
sible Cabinet, consisting of an office-hungry
Premier and as many office-hungry colleagues
as can find room on the pay-sheet. They
may possibly mean well and be sobered by
the sense of responsibility. But behind is
the party boss who has power but no respon-
sibility. Lord Mayor Lambert is the man
in N.S.W., and he is violent enough, but the
corresponding man in Queensland, who sits
on a throne at Maryborough, is reputedly
worse. The boss and his private Parliament
and Cabinet order impossible things, just as
the old prophet ordered the old Persian king
to live for ever, only with this difference—
that the king wasn’t threatened with deposi-
tion and loss of salary if he didn’t immedi-
ately live for ever, while the wretched Pre-
mier is. Poor John Storey was commanded
to open Parliament in February and run it
successfully without a majority, and to
appoint 20 trades-union organisers to the
Upper House when he hadn’t power to
anpoint one. The sack may still overtake him
for not doing these deeds. Theodore was
evidently ordered to bring back that unpro-
curable nine millions from London and to
return with the full moon under his arm.
It is practically a return to the nefarious
system of unpaid members, for the phantoms
at the back of things, who are the real legis-
lators, aren’t paid (not ostensibly at least),
so there is nothing that the nation can

It might as well threaten an unsatisfactory

Cain was the first teetotaller —at least, on
. account of the slaying of Abel, he must have
been about the first arrival at a place where
they don’t drink. Nobody gives 'him much
praise for swearing off. There is now almost
a rush to see which Australian Premier will
be the first to swear off foreign loans, for
the same reason that Cain had in the matter
of liquor—because he has a corpse (the
corpse of credit) on his mind. He won’t
get much praise either. Seeing that the
stoppage is obviously coming near, it seems
strange that there isn’t one man big and
strong enough to abjure and legally abolish
loans without waiting to be damned, and
thus snatch all the glory. It would be a
unique distinction, but there are few cheaper
ones in the market, all the same.
“Bildad”: In the course of a long and
wandering reply to some things I said and
many I didn’t allude to Bedford, of the
Queensland House of Lords, stated apropos
of nothing: “It wasn’t Britain made Aus;
tralia: Australian gold made Australia.
Made it tvliat? . .
One of the old inhabitants of Australia is
the Cost of Living Commission. Nothing
much is expected to come of it, for the cost
of living is agile and not to be overtaken
by any slow-moving body. It is like ascer-
taining by profound astronomical and mathe-
matical observation the latitude and longitude
of a flea. Long before the figures are worked
out the flea is gone. At latest advices the
members were in receipt of 68s. per sitting,
as if sitting was any use in pursuing a pro-
blem like that. Galloping would be too slow.
One of the results of Theodore’s visit to
the South was a sort of official statement
that “Queensland believes that the interests
of Australia will be best served” by the
Commonwealth abandoning the direct South-
to-North Line, to which it is pledged, and
building 750 miles of transcontinental rail-
way with Federal money through Theodore’s
State while its own Territory is left un-
developed. If any artist has an idea for a
life-like picture of Theodore considering the
best interests of Australia as apart
own State he is invited to submit it to The
Bulletin, which will purchase it, if satis-
factory, at current rates.
From a gallery-man :
The Federal Cabinet is not particularly cheerful
just now. The alleged possibility of Cook follow-
ing Fisher in London (though the matter is by no
means settled) has set Joe’s colleagues considering
the imminent return of Millen with unexpected am-
bitions burning* within him. A while back it was
mentioned that Senator Pratten would stand for
Parramatta (N.S.W.) if Cook retired, but now
Millen is making for the prospective vacancy, hur-
ried on by the stirring yarn that Watt and Hughes
are going to shake hands and forget the disturbance
that drew them apart. The Cabinet professes io
scoff at the idea of a rapprochement between Watt
and Billy, but, all the same, it isn’t fond of a
rumor that gives any extra impetus to Millen, who
is already moved by the suspicion that Hughes will
return home via America this year and create for
himself a Cocked Hat at Washington, Hughes may
decide to remain in Melbourne, but that won't pre-
vent Millen tearing home to become Billy’s lieutenant.
The strangeness of the whole position is Millen s
announcement of the Cabinet’s yearning to have him
back. He stated through the cables lately that
Hughes had urgently requested him to return, but,
judging by the Cabinet’s attitude on the matter,
the little man must have been dreaming.
“Griffith Moses” : Some more of the awful
roads around Sydney, which was in danger
of becoming accessible only by air or cross-
country camel, are to be repaired. In fact,
Sydney may yet become a place with billiard-
table approaches. But the work isn’t being
done so mudh because a city should be
accessible, but “to absorb the unemployed.”
Nobody concerned wants to have the unem-
ployed back on his hands any sooner than
he can help, and everybody wants as many
unemployed off his hands as possible, so some
of the repairs are said to be costing £OOOO
a mile of loan money. When the young
fathers live on loans, and the old and invalid
ones on pensions, and the elder children on
the motherhood endowment, and the baby
on the bonus, and the baby’s mother partly
on Dooley’s pre-natal allowance, and the
temporary unemployed are rationed in strike
time, then everybody will dwell in brother-
hood and take in the next-door person’s
washing unless the house famine is so bad
that there is no door next door. It has just
transpired that in the N.S.W. State coal-mine
the tramways that are to carry the coal
whep it comes out of the hole have been
building for six months, but nobody has
dug the hole that the coal is to come out of.
There was hardly enough money for both,
and the tram supplied more work for the
unemployed than the hole. It will be a
beastly bore if there is no coal in the hole.
“Myrtle Green” : While Watt was Premier
of Vic. he described Hughes, then Attorney-
General under Fisher, as “the trick monkey
of the Labor menagerie.” Since he parted
company with the other William he has
thought, if not said, harder things. In the
circumstances a reconciliation between the
ini eresting pair, even on the ground of
political expediency, seems the wildest
absurdity, although, of course, a study of
political history in Australia shows that
the apparently impossible is possible.
As a rule the expensive “experts” whom
•Hughes has poured into the Commonwealth
service are content with paying out gener-
alities of a gaseous and fatuous description,
but the other day the gentleman who runs
(for £l5OO a year) the Bureau of Commerce
and Industry had a brain-wave on the sub-
ject of boots. He advised the benighted
manufacturer to go in for exporting boots.
“South Africa,” the Columbus of commerce
said, was “a potential market for Austra-
lian boots.” Whereupon the secretary of
the Victorian Boot and Shoe Manufac-
turers’ Association arose and wearily re-
marked that South Africa was “reeking with
Australian boots.”
In a comparatively brief period, Australian manu-
facturers have built up a gigantic overseas trade.
They ship footwear to South Africa of the value of
more than ,LlOO,OOO per year. Our total exports for
1919-20 swelled to nearly £1,000,000, notwithstand-
ing the burdens of an adverse tariff and a heavy
increase in the cost of production.
That ended the controversy, and the Direc-
tor of Commerce and Industry returned to
his preposterous Bureau, whence, no doubt,
he will emerge, after a decent interval, with
an elaborate proposal for establishing the
dairying industry in the Macdonnell Ranges
by crossing the eland with the Angora goat.
The cheapest railway in N.S.W. (Parkes
to Condobolin), built over pretty flat coun-
try, was finished in 189 S, the cost being
£2135 per mile. The repair or reconstruc-
tion of the once splendid Sydney-Parramatta
road, spoiled by 13 years of neglect, is said
to' have cost £6OOO of loans iier mile. That
country is as flat as the Treasurer’s elo-
quence, but they do the thing properly these
days, and Posterity’s money is no object.
It wasn’t so much a road that was wanted
as a job for the unemployed, and it just
lasted till the Government escaped into
recess.
A PROGRESS OF SOCKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“During the month of November New South YV tiles
imported woollen goods to the value of £321,917.”
Within some valley of the Apennines
Or little island of the Grecian Sea
Life went on very primitive plain lines;
The people laughed and all the air was free.
They had some gardens and a little fruit,
Sheep that climbed up the hill and then came down,
Some bows and arrows that skilled men could shoot
And some nice buildings in a little town.
I dream about those ancient times with pain;
I sorrow for them always when I think
How little they regarded loss and gain
And what good things they had to eat and drink.
Their lives obscure and straitly circumscribed
Were pitifully pleasant all the year.
They laughed together lightly. No one gibed
At the full waistcoat of the profiteer.
I almost weep for their benighted state;
I feel their sad condition give me shocks.
Owning their sheep, it was their bitter fate
To always make and wear their native socks!
No, they imported nothing. I regret
To state their shame in such a public way ;
They had no commerce and they had no debt
And everybody went to see the play.
We live in shabby houses, paying rent
For a close wall to hide us from the light;
Our heritage is a vast continent;
We go to foreign picture-shows at night.
We don’t read many books, see many plays;
But we are owners of huge herds and flocks.
What would they say, those heathen of old days,
If they but knew the story of our socks?

The £21,554 shown as written off was applied
in reducing the book value of Government
securities to market level. The net profit
disclosed was thus £57,733, so reserves were
tapped to the extent of £7207 to provide the
124 p.c. div. Considering the severity of the
drought, which lasted practically the whole
of the financial year, tiie co. did very well,
particularly in view of the heavy taxes it is
now called upon to pay. In pre-war days
the A. M., L. and F. handed over to the
Treasuries between £7OOO and £lO,OOO per
annum; last year taxation called for
£61,001. “Special drought expenses” during
the year took £49,806, which indicates what
a wonderful time the concern would have had
if weather 'conditions had been favorable.
Though the co.’s venerable managing-director
declares that the drought was the worst in
his 50 years’ experience, the co. suffered
lighter stock losses than formerly, partly be-
cause greater attention had been given to
water conservation and also because of im-
proved transport. The drought broke just
prior to the closing of the accounts, but
almost immediately the wool-pooling scheme
lapsed, and this and other cos. are again
thrown on their own resources to finance
their own and their clients’ stocks, for which
there is at present little demand. Though
at the June balance the co. had about
£850,000 in Government securities, cash and
sundry debts (not including advances), and
in addition a pile of fixed deposits the extent
of which is hidden by their inclusion with
fixed assets, it has been decided to get in
additional funds.
For many years paid capital has stood
at £520,000, 80,000 £25 shares paid to £5
and 40,000 paid to £3. A £2 call on the
latter is to be got in, making both classes
rank alike. This will leave 40,000 £25 shares
unsubscribed; but the directors propose to
split this parcel into 200,000 of £5 each, the
uncalled liability being restricted to the old
scrip. For a start 60,000 of these shares
are to be issued, giving, with the calls on
old shares,, a paid capital of £900,000. In
other times when the A. M., L and F. wanted
additional funds it issued debentures, but
cheap money can no longer be got. The co.
still has command of a large volume of old,
perpetual debenture stock : at June 30 last
its own funds totalled £1,092,282, and it was
working on £1,898,640 of debentures,
£lOO,OOO carrying 3 p.c., the balance 4 p.c.
For some years visible reserves have ex-
ceeded paid capital, so though the dividends
look fat the return on shareholders’ funds
is nothing out of the way. The directors
have also come to the conclusion that 15 p.c.
divs. are liable to be misunderstood, so they
recently got shareholders to agree to an
amendment of the Articles to permit of the
capitalisation of reserves. But probably
there will be no bonus issue until conditions
become more settled. Meantime, shareholders
have been weighing the dividend prospects on
capital when it has been increased from
£520,000 to £900,000 by the call on _ old
shares and the new cash issue. The direc-
tors declare that “resefwes are now ample,
and do not see why they should be further
increased.” So that shareholders may gauge
prospects for themselves the directors set
down the results of the past 10 years’ opera-
tions in this way :
Those 10 years include two very severe droughts.
We have paid an average of 124 p.c. and we have added
to reserves, out of profits, £250,000. We have also
written off all losses, including £125,000 written off
for depreciation in the price of gilt-edged securities,
now nearly all short-dated, and therefore more likely
to appreciate than to depreciate further.
Some of the additions to visible reserves,
however, represented handsome surpluses re-
sulting from the sale of old properties, and
these profits will not recur. For that reason
the growth of reserves in the introductory
table is not altogether a reliable guide.
But things would need to go very badly with
the eo. before shareholders were denied a
X’easonable return on their money.
Owing to the lumping of cash with fixed
assets the 'balance-sheet figures *are not
illuminating, but this comparison over five
years can be given for what it is worth :

Reserves are now £33,500 less than five years
ago, but the writing-down of securities,
most of which will probably not be realised
on before they mature, has to be taken into
consideration.

Though the poor ship-owner is supposed to
have had a very rough passage during the
past couple of years, owing to strikes and
other troubles, this co. did so well during
the 12 months to Dec. 31 last that the div.
rate has now been taken to 10 p.c. for the
first time. For 1919 the directors disclosed
profits which left a margin of only a little
over £llOO after distributing a 9 p.c. div.,
but in addition to the disclosed profits of
£28,805 the accounts revealed a further
£22,115 which had gone directly into re-
serves. For the past year the directors
admit having earned £41,468, but that does
not include £10,962 additions to reserves for
insurance and repairs. The year’s surplus
shown by the accounts is thus £52,430.
giving a visible return on capital of almost
134 p.c. It is thus clear that increased fares
and freights have fully covered the heavier
expenses due to increased wages and higher
cost of fuel and stores. But there is nothing
very fat about this N. S. W. coastal shipping
co.: during the whole course of the table
above there has been no reconstruction or
capitalisation of reserves, and on visible
total funds the 10 p.c. to shareholders repre-
sents a return of under 7 p.c.
• •••••
Still the co. may be doing better than its
published accounts admit. No P. and L;
account is submitted: one entry alone is
made to give the year’s results. • So no in-
formation can be gleaned as to whether the
amount provided for depreciation was over-
liberal or otherwise. A little more light
can be thrown on the co.’s position, though,
by comparing balance-sheet figures over a
number of years:—
1910. 1915. 1919. . 1920.
Capital . . £218,750 £300,000 £315,000 £390,714
Liabilities . . 23,618 28,631 34,098 52,945
Ships.. .. 244,107’ 248,979 244,'529 302,944
Freeholds, etc. 23,612 26,809 28,835 29,945
Liquid . . 49,975 144,055 201,165 260,282
The feature of that comparison is that,
though the s.s. Noorebar was sold to Fiji “at
a satisfactory price” and no new vessel was
added to the register, .the book value of the
fleet is £58.000 more than 12 months ago.
This increase has been due mostly to the heavy
expenditure necessary to effect the extensive
structural alterations required by the regula-
tions of the amended Navigation Act, an
outlay which probably did not improve the
earning power of the fleet, though, perhaps,
when the directors revised fares and freights
they had an eye on this expense as well as on
additional working costs. During the_ past
year capital account increased by £75,714,
portion of which no doubt represented an
issue of shares against the acquisition of an
interest in Langley Bros., a smaller coastal
shipping concern. In the previous year
Allen Taylor boats had also been acquired.
The North Coast S. N. now wholly owns 22
vessels and a score of tugs and lighters, a
total tonnage of 16,535, with a book value
of £302,944, or slightly more than £lB per
ton. Of the liquid assets shown above,
£64.066 represents shares in other cos.,
which, of course, includes interests in other
coastal packets. Including these interests
with liquid assets, the liquid surplus moved
from £26.357 in 1910 to £115,424 in 1915, and
to £207,337 at the latest balance. The book
values of fixed assets at the same dates were
£267,719, £275,788 and £332,889, respectively.
But capital account increased by £81,250
between 1910-1915 and by £90.714; since, the
net improvement shown by the balance-sheets
for the five years to 1915 thus being £Io,SS6,
and for the five years since £68,300. During
the latter period the div. rate averaged about
half a point more than in the former. The
directors propose to add new vessels when
prices become less prohibitive; and the co.
is in a good position to finance additions to
the fleet, for at the balance it had £157,424
in War Loan, cash and sundry debtors, or
over £83,000 available after paying current
divs. and after providing for all liabilities.
That is, of course, if no further alterations
and repairs to existing vessels tap this cash.

Though City Council electricity has cut
into this co.’s field, the northern suburbs
have expanded so greatly that 70,970 tons
coal were carbonised last year compared
with 52,345 tons in 1915. Costs have
mounted so rapidly during that period that
the total expenditure per ton coal has
advanced from 425. Gd. to 575. lOd. But
soaring costs have not worried this and other
N. S. Wales gas cos. much; they are work-
ing under Government regulation, and an
obliging Act gives them easy access to the
Court—there is no indefinite wait on the
mat as in the Industrial Courts —which pro-
claims the price they are permitted to
charge. The Labor Government in 1912
set out to cheapen gas by fixing the stan-
dard price at 3s. Gd. per 1000 ft. and limit-
ing divs. to 10 p.c. The cos., however, were
first permitted to capitalise their reserves,
visible and internal, a move which dispelled
any possibility of anything like the maxi-
mum 10 p.c. For 1917 5 p.c. was the best
this co. "could do. Then an amending Act
fixed the standard rate of div. at 8 p.c., and
when the cos. can prove that this rate can-
not be earned the Court is asked for an
increased selling price. Thus the 3s. Gd. of
1914 got to over 4s. in 1918 and to 4s. lid.
in Dec., 1919, the price which ruled during
10 months of the period covered by the latest
accounts. But in November the price was
further increased to ss. sd. Gross income
has advanced 30 p.c. in two years, but the
latest net profit disclosed was almost £5OOO
less than in 1918. This comparison shows
how the printcipal figures have moved:- —
1915. 1918. 1919. 1920.
Gross receipts £149,461 £197,480 £215,548 £256,812
Total outgoings 93,714 120,546 140,501 183,684
Gross profit £55,747 £76,934 £75,047 £73,128
Less interest 6,995 8,126 7,614 7,864
Depreciation 17,588 20,216 21,315 21,644
Net profit £31,164 £48,592 £46,118 £43,620
The year’s £43,620 was £430 short of the
amount required for the 8 p.c. div. How-
ever. that is not likely to worry shareholders,
for the increase in price granted in Novem-
ber is helping current earnings, and if things
do not appear to be shaping towards that
8 p.c. there is always the Court to fall back
upon. Old shareholders can well afford to
smile at the blundering of the cheap-gas
politicians who, in 1912, allowed the co. to
reconstruct before applying the hobbles they
had designed. At the time paid capital was
£195,060, but when assets had been written
up bonus scrip for £145.000-odd was handed
out. So to the old hands the 8 p.c. is very
sweet, and notwithstanding that money has
become dearer that rate should still be suffi-
ciently tempting to new-icomers. The amount
which the co. is permitted to set aside for
depreciation and “special purposes” is also
fixed by the Act. Since 1917 £63,175 has
been appropriated, but replacements during
that period have called for only £2521,
leaving a balance on hand of £60,654. It
will be interesting to watch this accumula-
tion and what eventually happens to it.

The C.F.S. presents two sets of accounts
each year, but divs. to shareholders and
bonuses on sales are distributed only once
annually. The whole of the profit for the
half-year to Sept. 30 remains in P. and L.
until the results of operations of the current
half are available. Though the term covered
by the latest accounts included the tail end
of the severe drought, owing to the splendid
prices products have been fetching there is
every prospect of the value of the C.F.S.’s
turnover for the current year eclipsing all
previous records. Sales exceeded a million
for the first time 10 years ago; by 1917 the
figures reached, 2J millions; and for the T-
months to March, 1920, bounded to ov
millions. For the Sept, half of the current
year the turnover exceeded two millions, and
sales since indicate that when the books close
on March 31 the year’s turnover will have
been worth at least four millions. As usual, the
feature of the accounts is the small propor-
tion of book debts and of amounts duje to
consignors in relation to turnover. Total
sales for the month of September gave
£341,780, yet only £128,20V was owing to
producers, representing the value of less than
a fortnight’s supplies. This; performance is
made possible only by selling on practically
a cash basis: though ove r two millions
worth of products was handled during the
half, book debts at the balance totted up
only £242,519, a little more than two-thirds
of the turnover for the month of March.
Another feature of the C.F.S. has been its
small funds, but high costs and an expanded
business have lately necessitated getting in
additional cash, which has not been forth-
coming as rapidly as it should have been, and
the management has been put to some ex-
pense conducting a canvass which should have
been unnecessary among co-operators who
have had almost every penny of profit the co.
has earned. Two years ago paid capital was
£46,038; at the latest balance it had grown
to £82,429. But this increase has not been
ample to meet the co’s. refiuirements, and the
management has been inviting deposits.
£12,512 had been entrusted to its care at
March 31. The proposal, to amalgamate the
C.F.S. and the Berrima co. is still under con-
sideration. Meantime, the Australian 1 ro-
ducers’ Wholesale Co-op. Federation, the con-
cern promoted by co-op. societies throughout
the Commonwealth, is getting to work in
London, and is already finding markets for
some products, while others will pass under
its wing when freed from Government con-
trol.

The other day a N. S. Wales Labor mem-
ber. part of a deputation that was clamoring
for public works, barked at a Labor Minister
the hackneyed advice: “Take possession of
the banks: it’s the only way.” Talk of rob-
bery and repudiation is so common m the
party now that the Minister didn’t turn a
hair. Incidentally the December returns
contained some information for these heaps
of human ignorance who think banks are
rolling rivers of “splosh” and that if they
are seized all taxation will be superfluous
for ever. There was in the
N. S. Wales banks; at the end', of 1920 divided
like this :
In English-owned hanks .. £4,151,971
In banks fif other States .. ••
In Maoriland banks . . . . • • &°0,717
In the Commonwealth Bank .. •• 1,330, 42S
In N.S.W.’s own banks . . • • - • 12,490,908
So there is rather over £12,000,000 which
might be taken possession of without a fight
against overwhelming outside forces, though
the Commonwealth which controls banking
might fuss even then. But half of it is in
Federal notes —£1000 notes which nobody r
seriously proposes to pay and smaller notes
which the Federal Treasury would probably
refuse to pay. That leaves a possible six
millions less expenses of seizure, and at the
present rate of expenditure that would keep
N. S. Wales going for two months with care.
The infinite jest is that the State gets all
this money (bar the £lOOO notes which never
shift) about twice a year without any violent
and rowdy and bloodshedy iseizure. Prac-
tically all the money in the State wanders
into "the Treasury and out a .gain every six
months like the 12 supers who walk round a
tree till they count up to thousands, and the
banks stage-manage the processsion. To grab
the coin once and dislocate the- whole busi-
ness seems poor management, not to say
poor drivel.

Robert Reid and Co., Ltd., having dis-
placed its old English-subscribed capital
with Australian money when it shifted its
headquarters from London to Melbourne two
years ago, is now giving the local investor
another opportunity. This time a quarter
of a million of 8 p.c. second cum. prefs. are
offered. The co.’s business has expanded
rapidly in all States, and the directors
declare that much of the increased trade is
likely to be of a permanent nature. At pre-
sent there is £609,035 of ordinary capital
helped by £200,000 of 7 p.c. first prefs.
After providing covering assets for the first
orefs. and deducting all liabilities, there will
be net assets of a book, value of over li
million to protect the quarter-million of new
prefs. Security and interest prospects are
thus excellent. ✓

DORR PATENT CLASSIFIER.
LIMITED, George Street, Camperdown (City), Sydney
Australasian Representatives of the Dorr Company.
. N. S. Wales southern collieries in which
cinder-coal shows up are nowadays finding
a ready market for that product. Cinder-
coal is fuel which has been affected by vol-
canic agencies, and which in consequence
has lost much of its volatile contents and is
proportionately high in fixed carbon. In
the days when the stuff first showed up in
some of the southern collieries it proved a
curse, for there was no market for it.
Then it was discovered that it was well
suited for tne forced-draught conditions in
Sydney’s old steam-tram locomotives, par-
ticularly as it was practically smokeless.
When the electric system displaced the
steam-tram, the collieries lost a good mar-
ket. During recent years, however, cinder-
coal has been proved excellently suited for
producer-gas plants and for manufacturing
calcium carbide, and the collieries contain-
ing cinder-coal are now kept busy feeding
producer-gas plants and the Tasmanian car-
bide works.

A Melbourne syndicate is at present pros-
pecting the Wipgello deposits of aluminous
iron ores, near Moss Vale (N.jS.W.), with a
view to manufacturing metal aluminium on
a large scale. Deposits in France and Ire-
land, the world’s principal producers, are
showing signs of exhaustion, and though our
local stuff is not high-class, still it should
fill the bill, after allowing for contained iron
values. A marketable material should be
readily obtained, particularly since good
oxides are in keen demand by paint-manu-
facturers. Apart from metal aluminium, the
Wingeilo ores should prove a source of pro-
duction for sulphate of alumina, an essential
constituent for paper-manufacture. The
local demand for this article would pro-
bably approximate 1000 tons per annum,
with a present market price of ±25 per ton.

The lucky fossicker still pulls out an occa-
sional golden plum in N. S. Wales. r Ehe
“nugget” recently unearthed near Nobby’s
Yards, in the Bathurst district, went into
A. W. Dye’s Sydney furnace last week and
will yield the finder nearly £6OO.
According to geologist Harper the mass of
gold was not an alluvial nugget, but probably
represents an accumulation of the yellow
metal set free by the oxidisation of metallic
sulphides, chiefly iron. The slug resembled
a large potato 7in. long by 3in. thick, the
“eyes” being represented by buds of solid
gold which stood out from a matrix of gold-
spangled iron-oxide. Harper’s theory is that
the auriferous pyrites not only left free
gold in the oxidised matrix, but a proportion
of the gold contents was dissolved by per-
colating solutions and redeposited on certain
portions of the spongy gold, thus causing
the solid external eyes. The original weigm
of the slug was 142.120 z., and the weight of
the smelted cake 115.40 z. The assay stan-
dard of gold contents was 972, only 28
points below pure gold standard. Tne gold
will thus probably realise over £5 per oz.

Westralia has just lost the services of two
important gold-producers. One, the Lance-
field, through the foolishness of the A.W.U.,
and the other, the Sons of Gwalia, by fire.
The syndicate of Kalgoorlie and Perth min-
ing-men who run the former mine, declaring
their inability to pay the increased rate of
wages fixed by the Arbitration Court, offered
to let the property and plant to the men at
a royalty of Is. per ton ore treated. On
the basis of last year’s output this would
give the syndicate about £3500, out of which
it undertook to pay lease-rent, rates, taxes,
’insurance, etc., and provide for interest and
depreciation of plant. It is estimated that
if the men labored as much for themselves
as they did for the syndicate they would
earn at least the same rate of pay as last
year and divide from £BOO to £lOOO a month
in addition. But the union rejected the
offer, and the mine has closed down. Sons
of Gwalia, which with the Boulder, Horse-
shoe and Ivanhoe, has for a long time past
propped up the gold yield of the State, had
its battery and most of its power plant burnt
the other day. Operations will probably
not be resumed for several months.

Another attempt is being made to get the
public interested in McCahon’s leases, Mt-
Monger (W.A.). This time shares are
offered at Is. each in a co. which is being
formed to develop and prepare the property
“with a view of its ultimate - flotation in
Great Britain.” As an additional induce-
ment, it is stated that there are to be “no
further calls or liability.” According to
geologist Honman, the show still has a
chance. So has every other block pegged on
the Westralian goldfields, but though many
might pay in the hands of three or four
working miners, only one in a hundred is
good enough for a co. to tackle.

Hampton Properties, Ltd., had a meeting
in Edinburgh in December, and the best of a
rather drab outlook was made by chairman
Slater. He said that the Board was still
hopeful that good permanent results would
ultimately be obtained from the numerous
encouraging, if scattered, indications so far
secured on the co.’s properties, and that
before long they would assist in augmenting
the world’s supply of gold. The accounts
to Dec., 1919, showed £70,000 cash in hand,
including £5222 received from the sale of
53 Celebration City blocks, but during the
year it had dwindled to £51,000. In addi-
tion, the co. held 19,500 Celebrations, and
was owed about £2OOO.

usual, and sufficient to meet exes. Another
reconstruction scheme is being attempted,
but as the co.’s holdings are not valuable

fail.

From the General Chemical Supply Co.,
Ltd., which owns the manganese deposits at
Horseshoe Range (W.A.) :
“Awaruite’s” comments on.geologist Montgomery’s
report on the Horseshoe manganese deposits and his
comparisons of the deposits with those at Tchiaturi
(Russia) are somewhat misleading. The report
shows that, with rail and loading facilities, the
estimated cost, including quarrying, transport and
port charges, is about 255. per ton, f.o.b. nearest port,
and that includes a charge of 4s. per ton to redeem
the capital outlay on the railway, etc. This com-
pares very favorably with the f.o.b. cost of £1 6s. 2d.
per ton Russian ore in 1913. The million and a
quarter tons, valued at £13,000,000, to use Mont-
gomery’s own words, is the “estimated quantity of ore
in the superficial crust which was alone taken into
account in this figure,” while a reliable independent
report estimates the quantity and value available as
over double this amount. In quoting the analysis
of ore and average value of samples taken at 46 p.c.
metallic manganese, the report states that “the
samples are probably less clean than would be
obtained by breaking the ore, and that there is no
question that large quantities of ore could be
selected which would give much better manganese
ore for shipment than bulk samples indicated in
the preliminary examination.” As a matter of fact
three bulk parcels (two supplied to the Royal Mint)
gave an average of over 52 p.c. metallic manganese.

An agitation has been started in West-
ralia to abolish the present system of spas-
modic Departmental assistance to prospec-
tors and make an annual grant to each gold-
field for that purpose. Local boards
with authority to grant loans and provide
equipment for prospecting would, it is
argued, be better able to select the right
men than a Minister or a Board sitting in
Perth, neither of whom in most cases can
know practically anything of the men seeking
assistance and less about the country to.
be tried.

Ronpibon tin, which has put some of T.
W. Horton’s selections into concrete form,
is out after more cash. It increased capital
to £150,000 by the issue of 65,000 shares
in August last to get money to put a big
plant as designed by J. S. Henry on its
ground. The contract went to Ruwolt’s, but
payments to date represent only 20 p.c. of
the cost. To finance the balance the direc-
tors propose a £50,000 issue of 9 p.c. three-
year debentures, and since the tin market
has flopped the Ronpibon property, the co.’s
half-interest in Ronpibon Extended, the
Talerm leases and the dredge are offered
as security. As a further inducement deben-
ture-holders are to have the right of conver-
sion within two months after the declara-
tion of the first div.

Cash is being sought for the Talisker silver-
lead mine, a mile or two from Port Victor
(S.A.). More than one good man has gone
down over a belief in Talisker. which has
a big shaft sunk to 400 ft. and no plant. The
lode is credited with a width of 10ft., and
the shoot of ore with a length of 200 ft.
Assays are 20oz. silver, 35 p.c. lead and
19ioz. arsenic, which should pay easily if
there is enough material, but that point isn’t
at all clear in the invitation sent out to
investors to put up £50.000 in £1 shares.
There is talk of divs. ahead if £ll,OOO or
£12,000 is spent on jigs and crushers, but
will somebody first testify to the actual ore
proved and probable reserves?

“Geologist” on Queensland oil prospects:
“J.L.5.,” in stating that Queensland is a has-
been oilfield (B. 20/l/’2l), relies on the following
facts: (1) That samples of inspissated petroleum
(i.e., solid residual petroleum) had been found in
bores there, and (2) that the geological structure
is unfavorable for present-day oil reservoirs. He
is. of course, mainly quoting Cunningham-Craig’s
opinions of two years ago, and much evidence may
have furnished enlightenment in the interim. West
Queensland is covered largely with a vast cretaceous
formation, as stated, but that has no influence beyond
masking the attitude of the underlying petroliferous
formation on account of the stratigraphieal uncon-
formity between them. Cunningham-Craig stated
that “the geological -structure so far as is known is
not adapted to the concentration of petroleum, liquid
or gaseous, towards any definite or restricted loeali-
ties,” but this was clearly based on the information
that the series were disposed as an acline or very
gentle monocline, i.e., that there were no reverse
dips forming anticlines and .svnclines, of which the
former represent reservoirs for gas- and oil-accumu-
lation. The statement is fortified with a very clear
reservation.
Now for counter facts. (1) Partially or wholly
inspissated petroleum is found generally in producing
oilfields, although usually nearer the surface than
in Queensland; liquid petroleum has been found
in borings from three Queensland bores, including
Springleigh at 6700 ft., while it is to be noted that
this bore supplied an inspissated product at 3000 ft.
(2) Despite the thick overburden of cretaceous sedi-
ments, there is practically conclusive evidence that
the geological structure will not be unfavorable for
the occurrence of reservoirs. Geologist Cameron
proved the existence of a large syncline in the Win-
ton district in the Jurassic artesian beds, which
constitute the petroliferous series. The western anti-
clinal limb of this series outcrops for 100 miles
south of Cloncurry. This is also proved by the
gradually-decreasing depths at which artesian sup-
plies are met with proceeding to Cloncurry from
Winton. Jensen’s work north of Roma has revealed
an arrest of dip in the series, and boring is recom-
mended there. The same formation which extends
east to the Darling Downs and Moreton districts
shows in these localities reversed folding of a gentle
type, so that over the whole of the vast area in
which the Jurassic exist there is evidence of the folds
and terraces required for the arrest of oil, thus
bringing about favorable conditions for the concen-
tration of the petroliferous constituents of these
sediments. The committee in control of the develop-
ment of the Roma field favors putting further bores
down in that centre to test below the gas horizons.
“J.L.S.’s” remark inferring that the Queensland
Government has had a poor run at Roma is point-
less, and likely to create an erroneous impression.
The impeding tool is still in the bore, and has pre-
vented the prospecting of the field below the gas
horizons, and oil, as “J.L.S.” knows, is always
found when present at a lower level.

The latest entry in the £50,000 Oil Stakes
is the Melrose Petroleum Prospecting Co.,
capital £20,000. Leading shareholders are
the Kockhampton men who landed on a
winner when they bought into Ulam marble.
The area on which the co. proposes to
operate is in the Fitzroy Valley, from Mel-
rose (out Morinish way) to the lower Daw-
son Itiver country, and northward to the
carboniferous country on the Mackenzie. In-
flammable gas is known to exist in the pools
and lagoons handy to the sites selected for
boring, and this gas can be stirred up and
lighted with a match at any time. Whether
this gas comes from payable oil is another
matter.

A very fine surface show of copper was
recently discovered near Bajool, in the Rock-
hampton district (Q.), and as it is only over
the range from Mt. Morgan local prophets
are foretelling that it is a chip off the
famous old lode. The Warden considers it
the finest copper lode outcrop he has struck.
At the surface it is 14ft. wide, while it
has been traced over 100 ft. Picks are now
in, and a shaft is being pushed down to see
what it looks like below. There seems to
be a chance of its turning out a copper-gold
combination. It has been christened the
Ajax.

The Queensland sapphire fields at Anakie
have brightened up in consequence of the
arrangement made by the Government with
a Paris and Bombay firm for the purchase
of stones. This only applies, however, to
the blue sapphires, and a market has still to
be found for the really handsome “fancies”
in yellow, amber and pale green. The
European antipathy to these colors is based
on the large .synthetic manufacture of gems,
most of which are in these shades, while it
is difficult to produce the true sapphire blue.
The field will go a long way if only the
market remains reliable, as there is much
virgin wash-country.

The Queensland State arsenic-mine in the
Stanthorpe district appreciably increased its
output in the latter (mrt of last year, the
figures for the four quarters being progress-
ively 5G tons, 54 tons, 110 tons and 70 tons
of white arsenic, valued at £15,960 at cur-
rent market rates, although most of the pro-
duct is retailed at £lO a ton. Reserves of
ore appeared to be diminishing during the
year, and the lode in sinking thinned dowffi
to from 2ft. to 4ft., while in the higher levels
Bft. was not uncommon. Rumors got about
that the ore was pinc-lhing out, and a State
geologist has recently been looking for re-
serves. Driving has recently encountered a
junction with the Jibbinbar lode, carrying
4ft. of ore averaging over 20 p.c. arsenic.
As this lode has been exposed some 300 ft.
away, the State will not go short of arsenic
for some time to come.

South Glanmire and Monkland, Gympie
(Q.), which has been hanging on desperately
for the past three in the hope of some-
thing turning up, has given up the ghost,
the owner having decided to sell the pro-
perty. Tributors are after an advance from
the Government to purchase the machinery
and winding plant, and wild keep the show
going down to water level if successful.
Silverspur (Q.) is having a better run
than for many a day past. The chief de-
velopment last year was a new lode of gos-
san ore struck at the 120 ft. level, and new-
country is being opened up and prospected
as a result of the find. The last shipjhents
of ore to Kembla totalling 74 tons ehrried
xOOoz. of silver, an average of 91oz. per
ton, and there were 15oz. of gold with it.

Bright Hope tin, at the Soldiers’ Settle-
ment near Stanthorpe (Q.), which was
ushered into the public notice with an intro,
by the Brisbane press that the lode was
seven miles long and contained 75 p.c. tin in
places, has been jogging along on a Govern-
mebt subsidy. A considerable amount of
driving and sinking has been accomplished,
but no rich shoots have so far been un-
earthed.

Up to the commencement of the recent
strike trouble at Mt. Mulligan, the new pro-
specting tunnel was opening up very satis-
factorily. It has been driven 125 ft. from
the mouth, and the face shows a seam sft.
thick of good coal, it being considered as
good as the top seam now being cut in the
main workings.

and be allowed c n^ e p Mercantile World, both in Australia and England, and for some time past the
businesses have shown a large increase in volume of trade of a permanent and .t is on account of this, combined with the advance
in the nrice of eoods that the need of additional Capital has been realised by the Company s Directors.
P Capitalisation (out of the net profits of the year ended 19th July, 1920) into Ordinary Shares haying been already effected to
the extent of £l6l 551, With an increased addition of £30,926 to reserves, it is anticipated that the above issue of 250,000 8/* Second
Cumulative Preference Shares will provide sufficient for all further requirements. _ T , imn i_ .u. ju
g disclosed by the last balance-sheet of the Company, namely, that at the 19 th July, 920, show that over and above
assets covering the Company’s Debenture Stock Issue of £150,000, the First Cumulative Preference Share Issue of £200,000, and liabilities

The North Britons who helped, Governor
Stirling to found the Swan River Settlement
in 1829 were a tough breed. One of them
1. MORRIS,
Rabbi of the
Jewish Syn[?]jogue
of Tasmania.
was James Drum-
mond, whose
daughter, Mrs.
Mclntosh, died the
other day at t'he
age of 94. She
was the last of the
Parmelia pioneers.
A great-grandson
of James is Peter
Drummond, who
has been working
out landing-sta-
tions in prepara-
tion for a Cape-
Cairo flight. Peter
was a Perth
schoolboy when
the war broke out,
but before the
guns ceased he had
become the most
famous air-fighter
that either side
had on the Pales-
tine Front.
Isaacs, J., of the High Court, who has gone
to the Cold Country to spend part of his
year’s furlough, is one of the surviving mem-
bers of the 1897 Federal Convention. He
was Vic. Attorney-General when elected with
the other nine to represent his State. Quick
(practising law at Bendigo), Peacock (Min-
ister of Education), Higgins (High Court)
and Trenwith (living in retirement at Oak-
leigh and looking particularly well) are the
survivors. Deakin, Turner, Berry, Zeal and
Simon Fraser have gone hence. If Isaacs
brings back a Privy Councillorship with him
from London few will be surprised.
The wife of J. J. Long, who was one of
Tasmania’s six in the Senate until he heard
Flemington calling, or something of the
kind, has become the licensee of a pub at
Drouin, Gippsland (Vic.), where the tall
trees grow. Jim himself ran a caravanserai
near the racecourse that was the scene of
his punting triumphs, but a custom of
being too obliging to thirsty folk made him
unpopular in official quarters. He is going
to look after a stock and station agency
while Mrs. Long attends to the inn.
W. J. McKell, Minister of Justice in
the Storey Government, recently passed
his intermediate law exam, and looks like
being fully qualified before the next elections
come round. When Hughes. Holman and
Dave Hall studied for the Bar they were
strenuous politicians on £3OO a year, and
with difficulty found time to wrestle with
“Byles on Bills” and “Addison on Torts.”
Politics aVe an easier and more lucrative
business nowadays; it must be so when a
£l9OO-a-year Minister can chew law at his
leisure.
Captain Charles Travers Butler, one of
the Hobart clan who will chase Costs with
Butler, Mclntyre and Butler, followed first
war and then law, and both mixed, in three
continents. He enlisted in London and saw
service in Gallipoli, Libya, Egypt, Pales-
tine and Syria. Since the Armistice he has
been busy trying Turkish criminals for the
slaughter of Armenians.
A first-class engineering expert was lost
in T. E. L. Moncrieff, who went under to
appendicitis in Adelaide last week. The
son of a Queensland parson, who was sta-
tioned in S.A. in the ’eighties, Moncrieff
went straight from St. Peter’s College to
a motor factory, and then moved on to Scot-
land, training at Glasgow University and
working at the Argyle Motor Works there
at the same time. He had two years in
Sydney as agent of t'he co., and then got
back to Adelaide, to build up a big engineer-
ing co. bearing his own name, and to die
at 32.
Passed out suddenly from heart trouble
at Ballarat, Doctor William Morrison. He
had been on t'he staff of the Ballarat Hos-
pital since ’B5, was a major in the Army
Medical Corps and a cousin of the late
Dr. “Chinese” Morrison, who, after being
Times correspondent, was political king-pin
in Pekin for many years.

“Yoyang”: I question whether the Black
Dog Creek Hotel at Chiltern (Vic.) was
the first brick pub erected between Sydney
and Melbourne (B. 27/l/’2l), and put in
a claim for the Yass Hotel, Yass (N.S.W.).
In 1841 this “fine new inn,” as the Sydney
Gazette called it, was built at Yass by
Moses Moses, who ran it for many years.
After his death it was taken over by Chris-
topher Alt. Barnet Moses, the wealthy
Manlyite, is a son of Moses Moses. The
Golden Fleece at Yass was older than
Moses’s inn, but went out of commission
years ago, and is now the residence of Dr.
English. The Yass Hotel still provides
refreshment for man and beast.
“Smike” : Death has been hard on S. Aus.
representatives in the Federal Parliament.
In 1908 Kingston’s life flickered out, and
next year Jimmy Hutchison and Speaker
Holder went west. E. L. Batchelor got his
issue in 1912, and Alfred Roberts in 1913.
Senator William Russell was the next to go,
and Senator Guthrie has joined .his old pals
in the Valhalla of political fighters. Bar-
ring Kingston and Holder, all were Labor
men, and they all died suddenly except King-
ston and Russell. Hutchison had a fatal
seizure on the Adelaide express. The same
fate overtook Holder while sitting on the
front Ministerial bench. Batchelor died on
a walking tour with the Vic. Wallaby Club;
he collapsed suddenly when climbing a fence.
R berts’s end was even more tragic. After a
warm argument with the Chairman of Com-
mittees he went into the Queen’s Hall, and
they found his body at the foot of Victoria’s
statue.
“Philistine”: Two clever young persons
from the Windy Islands are showing London
that M.L. can produce brains as well as
mutton. “French Leave,” now running at
the Globe Theatre, is the work of George
Berkeley, an Auckland Uni. man. His play
is described as “quite the best of the latest
productions” by at least one critic. And
the initials, “K.M.,” have been appearing
at the foot of some Athenaeum reviews.
They belong to Katherine Mansfield, of
Wellington, who has landed a position on
the reconstructed staff of the Athenaeum,
now edited by J. Middleton Murray. A book,
“Bliss and Other Stories,” is announced for
early publication.
Ralph Segnit—he dropped a final z when
he enlisted —is a Broken Hill boy who was
studying at Adelaide School of Mines when
the war-dogs broke loose. Since the Armis-
tice he has been at Oxford, done a three-
years’ geology course in one, and won a
Burdett Coutts scholarship in that subject.
The latest news of him is. that he has been
appointed assistant geologist to an Oxford
University expedition just about to start for
Spitzbergen.
Roy Bridges’s brother Leslie, serving be-
hind the counter in the ancestral sports
supply shop at Hobart, found himself gazing
into the muzzle of a revolver which he had
just shown a prospective customer how to
load. The demand from the other end of the
weapon was for the contents of the till.
Les. edged along towards the cash-drawer
and bobbed down behind the counter, where-
upon the up-sticker bounded into the street
and fled for his life, with young Bridges in
earnest but fruitless pursuit. Next day the
robber walked into Hobart police station
and gave himself up. He subsequently
explained to the beak that when the shop-
man disappeared below the level of the
counter he (the amateur Thunderbolt) con-
ceived the fiorrible idea that perhaps the
dive was for a loaded weapon, and—well,
he left hurriedly.
JOHN HARRISON STORY, M.H.R. for
Boothy (S.A.).
“Centurion”: Mention of the Duke of
Westminster’s D.S.O. in a recent Bulletin,
and the remark that it was “not acquired
on a staff, but in action,” set me recalling
the actual happening. It was at the end
of the campaign in N.-W. Egypt against
the Senussi that the giddy dook received the
once-prized riband. The skipper and crew
of a submarined steamer had been wander-
ing about the desert in the enemy’s hands
for some months, fairly well-treated by their
half-starved captors. After the final combat
the prisoners were sent in under friendly
escort to the British camp. At the news
of their coming Westminster, with his fleet
of armored Rolls Royce cars, dashed out into
the desert—very hard going there —“dis-
persed” the unresisting friendlies and
“rescued” the prisoners. Owing to the dis-
temper occasioned by a prolonged dietary of
desert snails, the skipper and crew took a jaun-
diced view of their rescuers’ achievements.
Their remarks on the subject to members of
the composite L.H. Regiment serving in that
campaign are the basis of this yarn.
Alfred Snow, a bushranger of the ephemeral
sort, died the other day in Long Bay prison.
In 1902 he stuck up a coach near Broken
Hill for an expected opal cargo, but struck
a duffer. There was an epidemic of sticking-
up that year, coaches being robbed on three
other occasions, and in one instance the
robbers got away with £3OOO worth of opal.
Ordinarily western tracks make dreary travel-
ling, but in that brief period there were
spasms of thrills in several directions that
made coaching interesting. On one trip near
Wanaaring several passengers became wildly
excited when a man stepped from behind a
tree with a rifle, and stopped the coach. Om
man hurriedly transferred a roll of notes
from his pocket to his boots; another ripped
a cushion to hide his watch. Then they
waited in breathless expectancy. The blood-
thirsty highwayman wanted to know the time.
His watch had stopped. He was a kangaroo-
shooter.
“Jar”: The first Mayor of Perth (W.A.),
which recently celebrated its municipal
jubilee, was tfie late George Shenton, then
the proprietor of a departmental store (or
what passed for one in those days) at the
corner of Hay and
William streets.
Oddly enough
Lathlain, the pre-
sent functionary,
passed into the
mayoralty from the
same store, to be
knighted as Shen-
ton was. A few
days after the co-
incidence had been
completed the old
building went up
in smo k e. witfi
a bout £70,000
worth of goods to
keep it company.
The double event
had evidently been
too much for it.

0. S. ■ McPherson (Chief Secretary’s
Department), R. T. Lewis (Law Depart-
ment) and G. Glowser (Public Works) are
the three new permanent heads in the Vic.
service. As chief clerks they were the
official heirs to the retiring men in front of
them: Callaway, Anderson and Drake.
McPherson got no promotion when he trans-
ferred from the Education to the Chief Sec.’s
several months ago, but was given a lift of
£lBO a year when the reclassification list
came out before Christmas. Now he will be
paid £lOOO a year. Clowser is the luckiest
of the bunch. • He was a second-class officer,
with mainly accountancy duties, till Novem-
ber. In two strides he has nearly doubled
his screw in a few months. Lewis is in the
prime of life, has heaps of energy and knows
his job.
“T. 0.1.” : The old Sir Joseph Banks Hotel,
recently under the auctioneer’s hammer, was
built in tihe middle ’forties by Thomas Kel-
lett, originally a baker in Upper Kent-street
but later canteen-keeper in the old Soldiers’
Barracks in George-street, and licensee of
the Crispin Arms in Clarence-street (the
Central Coffee Palace is on the site). Kel-
lett was first licensee of the Sir Joseph
Banks, to be followed by William Beaumont,
who, from 1847 till the close of 1861, held
the house. In the latter year it was offered
for sale by Richardson and Wrench, one
of that firm’s earliest sales. In years gone
by it was occupied by Frank Smith, who
also kept the Burrangong on the south cor-
ner of George and Hay streets, a house wiped
out to widen the roadway.
“H.H.” : The suicide of James Crouc’ner,
the Westralian hangman, was an episode.
He was aged 66 and had recently married
a fairly young wife without telling her he
was Dennis, and when she discovered his
occupation trouble set in. The old man
didn’t go out by the road of his profession
but tied boulders to himself and dropped
into the Swan River. Seeing that Westralia
had only three executions in five recent
years there seems to have been little
save the theory to make a fuss about.
Many a doctor in large practice has a worse
record. As a point of logic, the Judge’s wife
didn’t complain and the Judge didn’t drown
himself. The- status of Dennis is variable.
In not so very remote times a Prussian
executioner said that by reason of low wages
and the H.C.L. his billet wasn’t worth hav-
ing but for its social status. In a land of
officialdom it was better to be a scragging
official than none at all. And in some times
an countries the public finisher has really
ranked high and been more of a hang-gentle-
man than a hangman. In Hungary he used
to have apprentices. In Serbia even early
in the present generation he went about in
pairs (but not; “male and female after their
kind”) and broke the joints of the condemned
alternately with clubs.
The widow of W. H. Dodery, who gave
his name to the Speck’s Leg. Council, has
entered upon her second century. Her hus-
band was in the ’nineties when fie died, and
the old lady is still able to take an active
interest in flower-gardening. Longford, the
little town wffiere she lives, has given the
Speck two Premiers—Lee and Solomon.
MADALENE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One girl of all whom I have known
Had Heaven in 'her smile:
She reigns on recollection's throne
A goddess, free from guile;
She showed in all she did and said
A nature sweet and clean—
A modest maid, yet not afraid,
Her name was; Madalene.
Of evil things I never thought
When she was standing nigh:
She came, and saw, and smiled, and brought
A sense of chivalry.
Incapable .at such a time
Was I of .action mean,
As when one hears old church bells chime.
Her name' was Madalene.
Fair friends she had: their beauty shone
The brighiter in her gaze:
I knelt to n one, save she alone,
In those halcyon days.
They all were bright, and sweet and fair,
Or plump, or lithe and lean —
. But she! she rarefied the air:
I breathed 1 naid Madalene.
I do believe that women can
In some sex- subtle way
Exalt the natu re of a man
Who never 1 earned to pray;
Some women w itch with humor quaint,
And some wi.'ih charm of mien:
This one I wor shipped as a saint—
An haloed Ma dalene.
Maybe some fool of common clay
Obtained her l!or his bride,
And dragged her down his earthly way
Until her true self died;
For I, who know not of her fate,
Have once in fancy seen
An angel form at; Heaven’s gate,
So like young Madalene.
A lofty type of lcvely face
May pass me in. the street,
Matched with a form of artless grace,
And smiling wondrous sweet;
Then will I raise my hat to God
And taste of joy serene:
The girl may think the old man odd,
She’ll know not that my friendly nod
Was meant for Madalene.
VICTORIA.

“D'ye hear that Maud gave her age as 25
when she married old Goldhags?"
“Knew he'd want a discount for cash, I
suppose."
“P. Pawnticket”: Moved by the curiosity
of their sex a group of Sydney girls arranged
that one of their number should communicate
with an “agony” advertiser who desired the
“acq.” of a “bright dom. y. woman, v. above.”
She sent along another damsel s photo, with-
out the permission of the original, and a
faked name; and to the delight of the
frivolous gang a letter came back. It ran
Pear Miss, —Youre letter received and' duley notid.
1 think from youre photo you will suit, but before
making a meet would be glad to know of one thing
which is imporetint. Are you used to milking
cowse ?
Satisfied with *this revelation of the soul of
the cow-cocky seeking a bride, the young per-
sons let the matter drop ; but it had an un-
expected development. The original of the
photograph began to be pestered by a hairy
and pertinacious individual who stopped her
in the street, claimed her acquaintance and
declared himself aggrieved because she had
not written to him. He added, to the lady’s
mystification, that it didn’t matter about
the cows. For the space of two weeks he
pursued his queer courtship, tracking the
object of his passion to her office and grin-
ning bovinely at her when she emerged for
lunch. Finally the distracted damsel confided
h£r trouble to a policeman, who got the odd
story from the hairy bloke and waved him
back to the bush.

corresponds with your own, has been borne
in on an Adelaide man. Saying goodbye to
a lady, a casual train acquaintance, he added
pleasantly, “Well, be good; and if you ean’t
be good be careful.” He assured the Court
that he was in the habit of springing this
jest of the.last century on all and sundry, and
that as a rule the victim regarded it as ex-
cellent. But this time the lady objected, and
told a friend that she had been insulted; and
the humorist got a horrible hammering.
“Bav”: The best revolver-shot I ever
struck was a Tommy sergeant in the North
Russia business. We were out with a
party of “white” Russians on a job that
consisted mainly of putting up a machine-
gun position of logs. 8010 had been trouble-
some and was sneaking past our outposts
at night; the gun was designed to keep
him out. Our liusskis had the wind up
badly. They wanted to break away and
run back to the rest of their company. We
had no interpreter with us, and could not
make them understand that they wouldn’t
be allowed to go back till" the job was
finished. At length they knocked off and
began to fade away. The sergeant stood
resolutely in the track. He picked up a
chip of wood, threw it into the air and
split it in two with a shot from his Webley.
Our gallant allies’ jaws dropped, and they
began to wobble at the knees. The “sarge”
put the other five shots into a bean-tin about
25yds. away. Then Muscovy grabbed his axe
and saw and hoofed it to the gun-position.
It was finished in half-an-hour.
“Callan Park” on the Flight from Sydney’s
open spaces:—
Sydney has long been one of the world’s most
notable places for al fresco lovemaking. The terrain,
with its numerous parks and beaches, is suitable, and
the climate invites. Of late, however, the theatres
and picture-shows have been looking up again at the
expense of the people who sell patent devices for
removing grass-stains from clothing. The Sydney
lover and his lass are mostly of the breed that
produced the Anzacs; yet are there limits even to
their hardihood. The following notes, culled from
the diary of a youth who thought recently to pass a
couple of hours in sentimental dalliance with the
girl of his heart in Centennial Park, suggest one of
the causes of the slump:—
8.30 p.m.-—Sat down.
8.40. —Heard sounds in bushes behind. Rising to
investigate, stepped on back of young man’s head.
He apologised, put his periscope back in its case,
and went away.
8.50. —Heard another noise, and was confronted by
elderly man with revolver, who demanded friend’s
handbag. She hit him from behind with umbrella
and he fled.
9.10. —Arrested for mis-use of park and other
offences by young man who claimed to be a ranger.
While proceeding to the police-station he said it
might be squared by present of friend’s handbag.
Growing suspicious, she struck him over the head
with umbrella and he fled. .
9.15. —Sat down again.
9.20. —Revolver shots.
9.22.‘ —Herd of horses and cattle stampeded over
us, one badly wounded.
9.40. —Heard soffnds in bushes. Rising, was con-
fronted by policeman with electric torch and revol-
ver, who said, “Put up your hands, Chiller. It’s a
fair cop.” Explained that lame was Wiified. “Ain’t
you Chiller the Mouser?” he asked incredulously,
still aiming his revolver at my brain. At this
stage another policeman appeared. Having gone
through my pockets and read several letters,
the newcomer said: “It’s all right. It ain’t him,
Bill.” They then went away without apologising.
9 .4s.— Revolver shots from direction of lake.
9 50 —Revolver shots from direction of Padding-
ton ' Town Hall, bullet oTlsing through friend’s um-
brella. , , ,
10.15. —Heard sounds m bushes and was con-
fronted by villainous-looking young man who said:
“Put up your hands. I want all ver both got.” Friend
was just' reaching for her umbrella when, with a
cry of “That’s him!” Bill and the other policeman
burst through the undergrowth. After a sharp
interchange of shots Bill dropped wounded in the
chest, and Chiller fled, also wounded, pursued by the
otiier officer. We went off in search of help and,
meeting an ambulance containing a dead policeman
and two wounded suspects, led the driver to where
Bill lay, and left the park.
The diary goes on to note that the young lady,
while insisting that she had had a thoroughly
pleasant evening, elected to pass the rest of it in
the Elizabeth-street tram-shed. “For own part,” the
entry concludes, “had same feeling as experienced
when troop-train steamed out of Amiens, December,
191 S ; namely: ‘Deserve all coming my way if ever
near the place again.’
OH, BOTHER!
MABEL'S VISITOR: “What's the surfing like down here?"
MABEL: “ Very decent .”
MABEL'S VISITOR: “ What a bore! How, I suppose, I shall have to alter my costume."
“Omocha”: How do these airmen do it?
Several times lately they have fallen through
big stretches of nothingness to a mercilessly
solid earth, and got off scot free. Last week
at Windsor (N.S.W.) one came down 100 ft.
and, though his passenger was badly hurt,
he wasn’t scratched. The very same day
at Ityde (N.S.W.) a bricklayer toppled off
a chimney-stack—and gat'e the coroner a
job. Why, a cousin of mine, dismally sober,
fell backwards off a horse-trough and broke
his neck!

The maxims of “0.K.” :
A girl who retires before a man’s advance always
has rising ground behind her. The further she goes
back the higher she stands in his estimation.
Two sorts of man are trying creatures to converse
with—the too-drunk and the too-sober.
The best friends to virtue are not people who
are ever longing for “a good time.”
Success in life is largely a matter of taste. One
man’s meat is another man’s poison.
Somebody says that Enough is always a little
more than you’ve got. Quite so. No man is so
contented with his lot that he’d refuse a lot more.
Never find fault with a self-respecting capitalist
or an honest working man. The" one regards your
criticism as impertinence: the other calls it “dirt.”
All people say we are bound to die sooner or
later, but only some people feel the force of their
own remark. The rest are parrots.
One swallow doesn’t make a summer, but has
made many a sinner.
The handsomer a woman’s back the more likely
is she to be spoken ill of behind it.
No man is a hero to his wife’s most intimate
friends.
Most women are more in love with Love than with
their lovers.
A man must be very old before he ceases to be
struck on somebody. The least susceptible are most
apt to be struck on themselves.
It is impossible to please everybody. This alleged
truism is ever on the lips of persons least disposed
to please anyone.
The incredulous will remain scoffers as long as
the dogmas of Christian faith doom incredulity to
damnation. “Unless ye believe ye perish,” or words
to that effect, can make no impression on the sceptic
who sees that in worldly affairs easy believers come
invariably to grief.
Civilised society is in a conspiracy to disown its
secret desires and speak of the careless sinner who
gets found out as one “unnaturally depraved.” No
vice is more natural than hypoerisy.

“Machete” : That yarn of the pub hireling
who wanted to sing the imported tenor for
a quid recalls a Charters Towers (Q.) hap-
pening of long ago. Two musical Cousin
Jacks had got into holts in the White Horse
Hotel, and after being separated continued
to hurl challenges at each other. “I’ll sing
’ee.” yelled one of the Tres, Pols and Pens,
“for a nued. I’ll sing ’ee for five qued.
so Ah week Dam’ ’ee. I’ll sing ’ee stan’in’
on tw-o-o beer bottles!”
“Gregor”: The daily newspapers “fea-
tured” the American Dr. Reiser’s remarks
about the progress being made at Molokai
in the treatment of leprosy. Yet three
months ago, when the official announce-
ment was made in Queensland that
a number of former lepers had been released
as cured from the lazarette, near Brisbane,
the only condition attached to their release
being that they should report at intervals
for examination, in order to guard against
the remote possibility of a relapse,
the same papers were singularly frigid.
The Argus had nothing to say con-
cerning the skill and sacrifice of the Aus-
tralian doctors whose patient work had re-
sulted in the effecting of the cures, nor did
it remark upon the research into the etiology
of leprosy by its own countrymen in the In-
stitute of Tropical Medicine at Townsville.
The Age dismissed the matter with a
five-line paragraph and a single heading,
alongside the report of a country race-
meeting half a column in length. And this
notwithstanding the fact that the ex-lepers
at Brisbane were probably the first in the
world, certainly the first in the Southern
Hemisphere, to be discharged from the living
charnel-house of a lazarette. Nobody who
is familiar with the horrors of leprosy would
decry the work of the Americans at Molokai
—-any man who voluntarily enters a leper-
station with the intention of helping the
inhabitants, white, yellow or black, is en-
titled to a full issue of Victoria Crosses with
SUITED HIM EXACTLY.
“ You'd be the last man in the world Ed fall
in love with."
“Well, that’s all I ask—l’d hate you to
love anybody after me."
a bushel of Military Crosses for good measure
—but it would be a fair thing for the
Argus and S. M. Herald to make the Aus-
tralian doctors feel that their efforts were
appreciated before enthusing over the work
of foreigners five thousand miles away.
Note received by a district nurse from an
indignant lady living in a humpy on the
banks of the Darling:—
Miss O Helen [O’Halloran] —1 am sending back

FOR THE DEFENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There have been many poignant scenes owing
to women serving on juries in London. One wife,
accused of misconduct with her cousin, appealed to
women jurors, saying: ‘I know you will
a mother’s feelings even if men cannot.’ ” Cable.
Mr. Bunkum, K.C. :
Ladies, I will not controvert the oaths
Of those who, avid for my client’s life,
Have spat their venom in yond’ witness-box.
He did, as has been mentioned, slay his wife —•
An undomesticated fashion-plate,
Who, draped in jewels rare and costly dogs,
Jazzed nightly in the city’s gilded halls.
But, ah! The provocation that he had!
The ruined dinners that she flung at him !
The dust-embedded furniture! The drinks
Which never, never were upon the ice!
And so at last he called on her to die,
And, finding her reluctant of the step,
Explored her weazand with a carving-knife.
Now turn we from these secondary things
To what I hold the crux of all the case.
Forget his slip and only ask yourselves:
Was he a 'man xoho loved his mother well?
And all our testimony, ladies, proves
That he was just that very type of man.
What said the witness Brown? “A mother’s boy.”
Miss Jones: “The apple of his mother’s eye.”
The Rev’rend Smith: “The Mother-light was there.
It, as it were, illumed his countenance,”
Now, ladies of the jury, Mrs. Briggs
That once was wife to him who fills the dock
Sleeps sound within the soothing arms of Death ;
But Mrs. Briggs, the gentle mother-heart,
The dear old soul who watched his infant steps
And smoothed his childish doubts and fears away—
Old Mrs. Briggs is very much alive.
I do not wonder, ladies, that you weep:
The briny outflow does you more than proud.
Almost I had collapsed in tears myself.
The simple point I seek to make is this:
You all have mothers’ hearts like Mrs.. Briggs.
Will you condemn her as the sun goes down
Upon the evening of her blameless life
To live deprived of her adored boy ?
Well may you sob “No! No!” and drown the shout
Of “Silence t” from the tipstaff with your cries
Of “Shame!” “Not guilty!” “Set him free at once !”
Yer ’onner, with all deference I claim
The jury’s spoken, and I ask for Briggs
A prompt release from durance more than "Vile.
I thank yer ’onner. Briggs, my boy, your hand.
True Justice has arrived to bless our land.

MOTORING in SAFETY
TWO things are essential in motor tyres —safety and
service. They should grip whether the road be
wet, muddy or slippery—and hold the car in it s.
path!
The non-skid quality is claimed for many makes of
tyres; but you will find that the anti-skidding feature
of most of them soon wears off, and the protection
against accident goes with it.
Thousands of Australian Motorists have freely acknow-
ledged the “BOOMERANG” pattern superior to any
other make, because no matter what the nature of the
roads, skidding is arrested whichever way the wheels
tend—they produce less suction—and on wet roads the
mud does not clog up the grooves and eliminate their
anti-skidding qualities as is the case with many other
fancy and so-called non-skid tyres, but as the wheels
revolve, the mud is cork-screwed out and every
“BOOMERANG” does its work.
“BOOMERANG”—
“There and Back Tyre.”

“Dido”: Conan Doyle, according to the
sacred honor of a brother spiritualist, was
waited on during his stay in Melbourne by
a tall, thin, black-garbed, melancholy
stranger with a sad tale to tell. He was
a haunted man and wanted to know from
an expert what he should do about it. His
wife had died some 18 months earlier, and
within the last few weeks had commenced
calling him up at night and giving him a
bad time about his past sins and his pre-
sent intentions. He had been compelled to
break off an intended secohd marriage by
reason of the fierce and unreasoning oppo-
sition of his first wife’s spirit. “She says
she’ll go to church and forbid the bans!”
wailed the widower. Conan Doyle gave
advice, more medical than moral, but it was
not at all satisfactory, and the visitor grew
truculent. “You ought to do something,”
insisted the disturbed widower. “I ought.”
demanded Doyle; “but why?” “Well, it’s
entirely your fault,” said the man, wagging
a long forefinger against Sir Arthur’s nose.
“She never dreamed of haunting a man till
you came along.” Then with biting em-
phasis: “You put it into her head!"
* * * *
“Spare Corp”: The use of “blank” (B.
20/l/’2l) was so universal in the Army
that sometimes, involuntarily, as it were, it
slipped out of holy mouths. I remember
a padre, a manly fellow, who rebuked the
Diggers for swearing—he said it was a
species of moral cowardice. “You repeat a
word,” he admonished the 'boys, “which
belittles yourselves and slanders your own
mothers —I call it a disgraceful habit. What
do you silly blanks do it for?”
“Snell”: The craving for houses in Mel-
bourne has bred a peculiar wolfishness in
the ! hunters. Take the case of Fallow and
the Fierce Female. The Fierce Female, a
large, well-dressed, determined-looking woman
who might have played Nero without a
touch of make-up, had apparently taken a
great fancy to Fallow. She began to haunt
THE REAL TEST.
“I tell you my people can afford
to pay for anything!”
“Poof! Nothing! Mine can afford NOT to
pay for anything."
the poor man. She was continually on his
mat. Every time she thought of a fresh
argument she raced away to Fallow’s place
and re-opened the old dissension. Finally
-ihe creature abandoned all restraint. Com-
ing out of Fallow’s front gate after the
failure of another most logical contention,
she turned on the householder and called
him things that brought all the neighbors
hanging over their gates. “A pig-head, if
you like!” she shrieked. “Never did I meet
such a disobliging brute. The swine
won’t listen to sense.” Then she turned and
addressed the heads over the gates. “What
do you think of him?” she squealed, shaking
her fist at the front window. “He won’t
sell his house! He simply won't sell his
house!"
“Pips” on the way of the Army:—
The Tite Barnacles of military departments are
at their best in the Medals section. The essentials
are (1) to keep the game going, and (2) to pro-
duce a deceptive appearance of keenness and energy.
The handling of the 1914-15 Star affords an in-
THE COMMON LOT.
“You old fellows think you are great flirts .”
“We do; hut usually some simple little girl gets us all the same."
stance of the ingenuity with which both problems
are tackled. . There is no such difficulty here as
confronted the officials who had to make up pay-
books and settle on them with reference to deduc-
tions for crimes, overdrafts and all sorts of other
entries. The number of men who qualified for the
Star is small, and no research, adjustments or cal-
culations are required so far as they are concerned,
since practically every soldier who was in a theatre
of war up to the end of December, 1915, is en-
titled. No offence short of dismissal with ignominy
from the service cancels his right. Yet the Medals
people (1) have not issued Stars to more than
about half those who are prepared to take them,
and (2) are continually advertising for officers and
men who have no desire for the decoration —in
several eases for the good reason that they are dead.
As regards the other service medals, it will evi-
dently be years before they begin to be issued in
any numbers. Up to the present not one ex-A.I.F.
man in a hundred has so much as seen one. There
is but a single reason why the whole business
wasn’t disposed of within a year of the Peace. On
one pretext and another it is protracted simply to
keep a number of gentlemen fussing about in uni-
form.
“Sixenate”: A curious adherence to the
ordinary forms of correspond-
ence is maintained by some of
the frenzied people who write
letters, which, because they are
frenzied, get into the evening
press. A clerk who admitted
that he had stolen the money
and announced his intention of
destroying himself finished up
with the conventional “I re-
main -——But he didn’t re-
main ; he was found dead before
the letter was opened. A union
secretary who turgidly informed
the employers that they would
be slugged with the strike blud-
geon if they didn’t capitulate
was still “Fraternally yours”;
and a man who did not marry
the girl wound up his last letter
to her before she wept on the
solicitor’s table with “Yours
faithfully.” But the most out-
rageous example of this sort of
of thing was perpetrated by my
worthless friend Feddup in a
threatening letter to his missus.
He wrote: “The first time I
meet you you are a dead woman.
Hoping you and the children are
well.”
“Murkah”: The resourcefulness of the
Australian breaks out in astonishing places.
During the visit of Edward P. no secret
was made of the fact that he was at all
times carefully guarded by the pick of the
detective force. Under the circumstances
who would think of the Royal train as an
unauthorised means of transport from Kal-
goorlie to Port Augusta—a trifle of 1100
miles? Reasoning that the total un-
reasonableness of the project was its
best guarantee of safety, an ex-Digger
chose that very train. Before it gathered
too much speed after clearing Kalgoorlie he
swung aboard and climbed on top. There
he sat awhile and watched the desert go
by. Getting cold he prospected along the
roof and struck the warm chimney of the
cook-house. But in an hour or two the
fire went out. Dropping down at the end
of a car, the adventurer entered the train
and found all hands asleep. Noticing a
ladies’ lavatory, and knowing that ladies never
—well, hardly ever —travel on royal trains,
he went in and locked the door. Except
that he sat in that confined space for two
days and a half without a bite to eat, there
ia nothing more to tell. Arrived at Port
Augusta, he waited till the hubbub had sub-
sided and walked out unquestioned.

“Billy T: Dr. W. G. Price, Melbourne’s
city organist, was practising industriously
at the great town organ one hot morning
when a cough called his attention to the
fact that he had an audience. There were
two men sprawling on the seats in the back
gallery. Their attitude suggested that they
had got up as soon as possible to avoid as
much as might be the stringency of the
early-closing act. The musical doc. took no
further notice for the time being, and went
on with the catch-as-catch-can contest with
a tremendous composition for the 100-ton
organ ; but presently he found his two audi-
tors had made their way to the platform,
and one was searching about the player’s
small enclosure with two coppers in his
hand. Presently, failing in his hunt, the
seeker got peevish. “Say, Jock,” he snorted,
“where is his tin?”

“Wodgil”: Whence came the ugly and
insanitary habit of licking ice-eream in
public out of wafer cones? From America,
no doubt; most of our follies drift across
the Pacific nowadays, whereas the solid
Yankee virtues stay on the other side. The
bush and the minor Australian cities have
so far managed to avoid the abomination,
but the average Sydney picture-show at inter-
val-time reminds one of a colony of praying
mantises getting to work on flies. Hundreds
of red tongues dart forth to their full length
and are suddenly withdrawn, having cap-
tured their prey. The process is repeated
until all the frozen toothache has been
licked up, whereupon the cone on which the
ice-cream boy has imprinted his perspiring
and germ-laden fingers is hastily scoffed and
the item is encored. Needless to say the
young female of the species is the most
persistent offender, but her ma and gran’ma
are almost as bad, and in gran’ma’s case
the procedure is more deliberate —an un-,
sightly concave lump of meat slowly pro-
trudes and sinks back, smeared to the root
with ice-cream, into a hideous mouth. It
is a spectacle that would sicken a scavenger.
A dentist tells me that the calamitous prac-
tice is ruinous to the teeth. But as a rule
gran’ma has no teeth to ruin.

An old landmark of Speck history is
disappearing with the pulling down of
Horton College, near Ross. It was opened
in 1855, and for years drew scholars from
all over Australia. But the development of
the big public schools in the cities killed
it, and the shutters had to be put up in
1892. For years it has been standing in
lonely desolation, and the Methodists, who
owned it, were glad to sell it for a song.

“The Pip” recalls a bull’s-eye:—
The Calverley Revolver School gave me an insight
into one of the ways they have in the British Army.
Representatives of all commissioned ranks, from
colonels to subalterns, did the fortnight’s course;
and amongst the crowd were two Aussies—my battal-
ion C.O. and myself. . Daily during our lessons to-
gether did Colonel Bangs, D. 5.0., demonstrate his
incapacity with a weapon which, despite the popular
impression of war, gained from film plays, was little
used in Flanders. The day dawned for the examina-
tion, and I entered serene in the conclusion that
whoever else beat me I was certain, subaltern though
I was, to lick the Colonel. .
The convincing ground was a trench along which
each competitor crawled with a dozen rounds dis-
tributed between his drawn revolver and his pockets.
At intervals dummy Germans flashed from the walls
or up through the floor, while dummy bombs went
off in unexpected places. A bull’s-eye counted 10,
and the checking was done by an n.c.o. who followed
each shooter and called the results to the instruc-
tors (and also, on this occasion to the U.O. of the
Training Brigade and the G.O.C. of the district)
as they walked along the parapet. We shot in alpha-
betical order, and I came just before Colonel Bangs.
“Fower!” shouted Corporal Loamshire as I scored
what I could have sworn was a bull’s-eye. “Foive,”
he announced as I seemed to land a riddled present-
ment of Hindenburg fair in the forehead; and again
“fower” and even a couple of twos. I retired with
an aggregate that suggested either myopia or drink.
“God help old Bangs!” I reflected. “There’s evi-
dently more in this than either of us thought.”
Simultaneously, his revolver cracked, and was fol-
lowed by a resonant “Noine!” Another shot. “Noine
again, zurr! ” Peering into the trench I saw the
Colonel stumbling through the smoke, his revolver
waving freely in defiance of all the rules as to
safety that we had assimilated during the preceding
fortnight. Crash came the Crown Prince out of a
traverse, and a smoke bomb landed at Bangs’s feet.
As his revolver exploded there was an enraged cry
from the G.O.C. and a large piece of wood splin-
tered out of a post a couple of feet from the great
man’s head. “Bull’s-oie,” roared Corporal Loam-
shire impassively, and then at last I understood.
The convention was that 'officers should emerge
from these affairs in their order of seniority, Colonels
at the head of the list and so on downwards. My
leader, despite his narrow escape of shooting a
brigadier, got within six of the “possible,” and was
issued a first-class certificate.

“P. Pawnticket”: Some day when I am
not busy and the pubs are closed I intend
to worry the courts with a test ease. If a
finger lightly placed on anybody who resents
it can be a technical assault, what would
you call a policeman’s protracted and invidi-
ous stare? I was standing at a street corner
with three other reputable citizens when a
massive John Hop approached and fixed the
four of us with his steely eyes. We hadn’t
been doing anything except defy the liquor
laws—which doesn’t matter as long as you
get safely off the premises—we were not in-
tending to do anything, unless it was to go
home; and until that policeman came along
with his insulting stare we had been
supremely happy and careless of the fact
that it was 1.30 a.m. I am not surprised
at Jones having been instantly reminded of
SHE KNEW WHERE TO GO.
HE (just accepted ): “ Ai’m aw flay fond of
naive cake, doncherno. Are you—ah—
a good cake-makah?”
SHE: “Well, Ai've nevah traied; hut there

could take a pattern from — aren’t
there?”
his home duties, for his wife looks extremely
like a big policeman when she is annoyed
(she is never any other way when I am
with Jones), but it hurt for Smith and
Robinson to say, “Well, we’ll have to do a
bunk.” Frankly, it hurt. And it angered
me all the more because, in spite of myself,
I felt the compelling influence of that mas-
sive brute’s stare. It reminded me of my
wife, of my promise to be home at 5.30 p.m.,
of six or seven debt-collectors, of an unpaid
gas bill and of the landlord getting offensive
about the rent. I lighted a cigarette care-
lessly, and tried to carry it off —nodded
affably at the Robert and said it was a
rotten night, and hoped he had only just
commenced duty and had all the night before
him—but I felt as if he had assaulted me,
and hundreds of perfectly respectable citi-
zens have had the same experience. The
day will come when laqjk of heavyweight
recruits will necessitate undersized men
being admitted to the force, and then —ah,
then!

By Brown’s neat grave to take her stand,
And hold a metaphoric hand.
She diligently drove away
The sorrel springing every day.
When Mrs. Robert Wittle died
Poor Bob would sit her grave beside
On Sunday afternoons, and shed
His briny tribute to the dead;
And dimpled Mrs. Brown and he
Had quite a bond of sympathy.
But presently, I understand,
’Twas Bob who held the widow’s hand.
She decked herself in orange spray,
And all her weeds she cast away.
Now where the sorrel sheds its seeds
Brown’s grave is thick with widow’s weeds.

THEY’VE HOT THEIR USES.
DAD COCKY: “I see by the paper, mum, that
our Bill's sheep won the highest en-
comiums.”
MUM COCKY: “I’d sooner 'ave the money
meself; but anyhows they’ll come in
’andy fer ’anging on the walls.”
“Tena”: The year we started dairying on
the Richmond even the local cockies said was a
wet ’un. The yards were mostly muck three feet
deep, and we had to lever the cows out of the
corner bogs with a sliprail. Mum and Dad were
in the muck so constant that their feet got crook
—sort of rot set in. The paspalum grew till it
threatened to smother us. It twined through the
floor and threw us down when we moved about. The
potatoes all got second growth, and Sis’s young man
slipped and broke his leg. I used to curse cows,
dairying and milk with all manner of curses when
I had to struggle through slushy grass 10ft. high
at 3 o’clock each morning. The cows themselves
used to groan about it. Even Mum reckoned there
was too much rain. The last straw that broke
the camel’s trunk was when Findlay, the owner,
reckoned as how the rent was too low for such a
well-grased place. Dad called him a something with
adjectives in front of it, and Findlay summoned
Dad for assault. We left the farm then. I got
a job in a hide store. It’s some satisfaction to be
reminded that all the cows ain’t alive.
“Ragar” : When the sardines move up to
the warmer waters of Torres Strait the islanders
have no trouble in getting a cheap feed. I have often
called a native and told him to “go catch ’em,”
and have had a couple of hundred of the tasty little
fish brought up to the house in about ten minutes.
Black Brother simply walks up a cocoanut-tree, cuts
one of the eight-foot leaves, splits it down the
midrib and quickly weaves it into a basket. Armed
with the basket he wades out into the water where
the sardines are so thick that he can scoop them
up literally by the basketful. Heads and tails are
cut off, the fish gutted and then fried, and they
make a dish that takes some beating; even up there,
where one can get some of the finest fish that were
ever caught.
* * * *
“Euro”: I have never seen the wedgetail-
eagle carry off a lamb, but he will remove full-
grown fowls. I once watched an old white hen
taking the trip. On a tableland sparsely littered
with stunted bushes I saw two of these birds cap-
ture a big wallaby. When he ran they pecked at him
with their beaks and buffeted him with their great
wings, and when he sheltered in a bush the wings
came into play again. He never had. any sort of
a chance against them, and I don’t think he at-
tempted a defence.
* * * *
“Scrub-dasher”: Ever use spurwood for
mauls? I find there is no better timber on God’s
green (etc.) earth. It stands out on its own. Some old-
time splitters swear by lignum-vitae, but spurwood for
me every time. 1 have split thousands of posts, and
the maul looked like a newly sawn-off piece of timber
at the finish. This vegetable grows plentifully on the
Atherton tableland and around the Cook district
(N.Q.). Of our northern hardwoods it is second to
nothing.
* * * *
“Algie”: Can kangaroos swim (B.
6/l/’21)? Well, I won’t answer for kangaroos, but
wallabies can. A couple of years ago, while boating
on the salt-water river at National Park (N.S.W.), I
noticed what appeared to be a dog swimming in mid-
stream. As we got closer the animal headed for the
bank, and soon revealed his identity by hopping away
on hind legs and tail. The river here is tidal water,
deep, and over 100 yards wide.
* * » *
“Abbotsford”: “Digger” (B. 6/l/’2l)
wants to know how to corn mutton. The morning
after killing, when the carcase is cold, cut up
with the chopper, putting aside ,parts wanted
fresh, such as legs, a few chops, etc. Take the
rest and rub coarse salt in for a few minutes;
then put in a clean sugar-bag, throw a handful
of salt in for luck and tie up under a shade. The
moisture drawn out by the salt will drip away,
and the mutton keep good for a month.
* * * *
“C.A.L.”: Here’s my bush tragedy. Jack-
son, a neighbor of ours, on his fortnightly jaunt
to the township, took the
family teapot, a huge tin
affair, to have the spout,
which was leaking at the
joint, soldered. When the
missus rounded him up in
time to start for home Jack-
son was pretty full, so she
let down the tailboard of
the spring-cart and assisted
him in, to lie on the bottom
and sleep it off during the
journey home. Amongst the
numerous parcels, also lying
on the bottom of the cart,
was the teapot, duly repaired.
By some evil chance Jack-
son’s jugular rested against
the sharp lip of the spout,
and in 20 miles of jolting
over a rough road it rubbed
through the skin and the wall
of the great vein. When
Mrs. Jackson pulled up in
the stable yard at home she
was a widow.
“Griffith Moses”: The wild-dog trouble in
Western Queensland and N. S. Wales becomes so bad
that these places may yet lose their Parliamentary
representation through the canines eating the candi-
dates. Eagles multiply almost as fast as dogs. Be-
tween the two sheep country is being transformed
into cattle country because the bullock, though less
profitable than the sheep, is better at an argument.
But as the sheep retreats east the faithless hound
follows him. The hound apparently doesn’t keep
down the rabbit, because that animal takes refuge
underground, and if a • subterranean sheep could be
evolved the position might be improved. So far,
however, the sheep is a helpless, unprogressive un-
adaptable creature, who doesn’t even show much
capacity for climbing trees, and that would do at a
pinch.
* * * *
“Eddyson” : We had put in a water-wheel,
and owned a mill of five stamps, and were bent on
making the leaders of Muffin Hill profitable. Dan
Martin, a hatter of the most bigoted description, was
working the leaders along the rise about a quarter of
a mile from us, through thick scrub-gums and across
a rock-tumbled gully precipitous enough to be called
a gorge. Dan lived in a small, well-built log hut,
and worked the veins in open cuts, most laboriously,
but apparently in perfect content. He did not even
keep a dog, and neither parrot nor magpie shared his
solitude. Most of the leaders would go a couple of
ounces to the ton, but a ton took so much gouging
that twice the yield would have offered no great re-
turn for time and trouble. There were, however,
occasional rich patches that strung men on —patches

of crumpet gold, squeezed between the walls of rock.
It was not our luck to get any, but they accounted
for the fact that the whole face of the rise was
pitted. Just now, as it happened, we had no neighbor
but Dan Martin, and X fraternised with him. We had
a common weakness —we both tried for blackfish along
Dill Creek. We became friends of a kind, and one
day Dan astonished me with his confidence. He had
something on his mind. He showed me what it was.
In his hut was a sunken zinc-lined case which served
as a cellar. Here he kept his food. But the case
lifted out, and revealed a candlebox. In the candle-
box were various cakes of gold like miniature crum-
pets—s-00 pounds’ worth, I estimated. Dan explained
that he had struck it in a tunnel along the rise two
years ago. “What’m I goin’ to do with it?” he asked
complainingly. I suggested selling, but he was sure
Cfollins, the storekeeper at Cassilis, could not buy
so much. “Bun it in to Bairnsdale, and sell it to the
bank,” said I. Dan took my advice. He went up
next time the Colbar teams passed, and returned
in due course. But I had only increased his diffi-
culties. He next showed me four bundles of notes in
the sunken eandle-box. “Now, what the devil am I
to do with them?” he queried. “The damp’ll get
at ’em, and they’ll go mildewy.” I advised spending
them. “But ’ow?” wailed Martin, “I don’t want
nothin’ ’cept a bit of bread and a bit of meat and
a bit of ’bacca and tea/ I bought a new rug on’y the
other day.” A suggested trip to Melbourne flabber-
gasted Daniel. “Me in Melbin!” he gasped, “Gor-
struth, I never lived in a street in me life!”
Eventually we went higher up the range and I did
not see him again for eight months, but when passing
back with the teams from Colbar I looked him up.
He was much easier in his mind. “I got rid of ’em!”
he explained gleefully, and I gathered he referred to
his bank-notes. “I sent ’em, a bundle at a time,
to the horspitals and asylums.” He paused. It
seemed to occur to him that this was folly that needed
excusing. Then he added: “The damp did get at
’em” —and, after another pause—“l knew they
wouldn’t keep.”
* * * *
“Satellite”: “Two Seas’” talk (B.
23/12/’2O) of instinct in sheep reminds me of a
rather remarkable exhibition of it in 1914 by an old
ram and two ewes. A mob of sheep had been moved
from Drymma down to the south of Yorke’s Peninsula
for transhipping to Kangaroo Island for feed. About
50 of the mob got away and were lost. Nothing
could be heard of them. A month later word was
sent to Drymma that a ram and two ewes bearing the
station’s registered brand had been seen at Lochiel,
4C miles from the place where they were lost, making
northward. As there was not a blade of grass on the
roads, the wonder was how they did it, and interest
was aroused in the homeward trip of the wanderers.
They still had 25 miles to go over a barren road and
the days were red hot. Their progress was keenly-
observed for the last 10 miles. They travelled by night
and camped by day in the shade of anything avail-
able. Early in the morning of the last day’s touring
they crawled slowly to the home gateway, where they
lay down, and when they were let in made slowly
for a partly-used old straw stack. They had been
over a month on the road ; water could be got at the
various troughs, but of feed there was none to be
seen anywhere. About 25 of the lost mob were found
at South Hummocks, 46 miles south. These had to
be brought home in a spring trolly and were just
about on the point of collapse when unloaded. This
makes the old chap’s jaunt with his two lady-loves
all the more remarkable. They all lived, and each
of the gins reared a family.
* * * *
“R.W.”: I heard a wail recently about
the neglect of the cattle kings in allowing the dingoes
to get the upper hand. The merino coves are as
much to blame in Queensland. We have a Court
award that station-hands shall receive £3 7s. per
week, with a scale of rations. This being a hit in
the eye for those who had previously paid £1 or 305.,
they straightway reduced the hands. I have in mind
one station which employed 40 hands all the year
round. Now there are seven or eight. The score of
boundary-riders has been reduced to two. The
fences are attended to in a very indifferent manner
by the musterers or the horsedriver or the general
rouseabout. A musterer will ride one paddock some
25 miles round before dinner and do a second in the
afternoon. In the old days the boundary-riders would
keep the dogs in check. It’s easy to do that if the
job is stuck to, but nowadays everyone is far too
busy to bother. One station in this neighborhood is
starting on the erection of a hundred miles of dog
fence. But as the dogs are already in the fence
will merely stop them from getting out.

“C.L.M.” : “Ragar’s” belief that pawpaw
trees growing in the vicinity of houses arc a menace
to health is generally accepted, but why the exhala-
tions from this useful tree should be more dangerous
than those from other trees is a mystery to me. My
idea, after having allowed one of these trees (male)
12 months’ lease of the ground outside my bedroom
window, with no bad results to my health, is that
“Ragar” should look farther afield for the cause of
the illness in the family—unless, of course, we can

YANGAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The misty hills of Yangan were arched above with
skies
Rose-white as white-rose pallor, rose-red as red-
rose fire;
O’er Sturt’s grey peak e’er watching with still and
stony eyes
Of old the dawn flame broadened, a blinding color
lyre.
Leaf-brown with pools that mirrored the changeful
eyes of Spring
The glamored creeks of Yangan were cool with
green and gray;
Drowsed in the white, white noon-hush with willows
whispering,
They loitered down to Yangan to dream the hours
away.
Youth-haunted, aye, youth-haunted, the roads of
Yangan gleamed,
And far and far beyond them my eyes of old
would gaze—
Ah, rainbow gold of vision! Ah, dreams so vainly
dreamed!
For me no more forever those glad enchanted
ways!
Across the maize at dawning, across the windy
wheat,
About one Yangan homestead the magpies sang of
old,
And one would rise and hearken their magic silver-
sweet —
A blue-eyed girl with tresses of flame and flying
gold.
Love-haunted, ah! love haunted, the roads of Yangan
grew
For twain who fared beyond them, to goals that
lovers know!
l'ear homestead white with blossom, dear vanished
eyes of blue,
I lost my heart at Yangan, ah, twenty years ago!

“Jim Carew”: “Scrub-dasher” (B.
6/l/’2l) asks if Mr. Hawk took in a housekeeper or
re-married when Mrs. Hawk paid the extreme penalty
for fowl-stealing. If “Scrub-dasher” had watched
the actions of the bereaved husband he would have
seen some interesting things. On discovering the loss
of his spouse, Mr. Hawk proceeded to the residence
of his nearest friend and invited the friend’s wife to
elope with him. Of course, the friend objected, and
a fight ensued, in which the objecting husband was
beaten, if not killed. In this case the widower had an
early victory, as he was soon back home. Had he
been beaten in the first fight he would have continued
on his wife-corrupting expedition, until he found a
hawk he could thrash, or until the hawk fraternity
got so tired of his mischief-making that they attacked
him en masse and killed him. P.S. —The hawk whose
wife he stole probably got another by the same means,
but he had too much sense to try to get his own
back. And, anyhow, perhaps she wasn’t much of a
cook.

“W. Blister”: “Sandfly’s” eyesight being
naturally affected, he didn’t notice that I stated in
my par re Doubtfire’s ’rooing performance that
“Doubtftre visited a tank in the Wilcannia district.”
His object would of course be to secure ’roos by what
is known as tank-shooting, and it was thus that he
put up the record—not by paddock-shooting, as sup-
posed by “Sandfly.” As there are doubtless thousands
ignorant of tank-shooting, I will explain. Having
selected a tank or waterhole where ’roos are water-
ing, you pick your hiding-place, and, armed with a
shotgun, take up your position, about sundown. Soon
the ’roos begin to arrive, and if the weather is hot
and the feed dry there will be little time to spare.
Large shot is used, and experts rarely miss. Moon-
light nights are preferred, but many shooters work
on dark nights. ’Roos rarely carry shot more than
50 yards; an odd one may be found three or four
hundred yards away. At daybreak you wade in and
peel them. No horses to hunt, no tiresome stalking
of your quarry, and, as your work is right at home,
your damper and meat are cooking whilst you work.
Experts in this district reckon a man a drone who
cannot skin and peg 12 average ’roos per hour, and
Doubtftre was a remarkably fast skinner and pegger.
By the way, a man .who uses 60 pegs per skin is a
mug. Thirty will be found just as effective: I have
proved that by actual returns received.

“Orwell”: Binghi is probably the hairiest
man on earth. Instead of paying extravagant prices
to be shorn, he takes pride in encouraging nature.
Near the Fitzroy (W.A.) I have frequently seen a
buck in his best three-piece suit. He had woven
his own hair into cords, one of which was twined
round the head, another round the right arm, while
the third served as a girdle. The armlet was
almost purely ornamental, and monotony was avoided
by working into it pieces of broken bottle, nails and
bone. He sometimes carries dry grass for kindling
under it in wet weather. In the waistband is room
WASTED ENERGY.
“But it ain't no use, Bill. He’s too
drunk to (hie) stan' still a minute so's
I can ’it 'im!"
for a variety of objects that would make the school-
boy, limited to trouser pockets, sick with envy.
Besides the tomahawk and throwing-sticks that are
always there, I once saw dangling round the loins
of a successful hunter three cockatoos, a ’possum,
two snakes and a gohanna.

MISTRESS McCAGAN ( mistaking Mr. McCagan’s home-coming for the milkman) : “Is

“Pongo”: “Jim Carew” (B. 6/l/’2l)
wants to know whether ’roos can swim. Dunno
about ’roos, but I once, with some others, endea-
vored to head a wallaby on the flats at the head
of Middle Harbor (Sydney), and when we thought
we had him cornered he turned and took to the
water. He swam across to the other side, 40yds.
off, and we fellows, all speedy swimmers, hadn’t
the ghost of a chance of catching him, though
we started almost on his tail. I didn’t notice
whether he wet his ears or not.

“Bad Australian”: Tell the Digger who
wants to know how to corn mutton to
soak a couple of thick cornsacks in water
and lay them out on a bench or the
ground. Then kill and dress his
“monkey” and divide it longitudinally;
place the warm meat on the cornsacks,
with the outer side downward, and cover
the whole of the upper surface with a
liberal layer of salt. This done he is at
liberty to go on with the corn-shelling
or that job on the nippers’ boots. By
the time the chickens are getting off the
roost the meat will be well and truly
corned. Beef should be cut into handy
junks before salting. This is a sure
method of saving meat, no matter what
temperature the water-bag registers. I
have seen excellent bacon made from
porkers up to 1201 b. treated in this
manner, the whole process of salting,
smoking with damped chaff and deliver-
ing to the local storekeeper being com-
pleted inside four days. If the Digger
cares to vary the menu let him cut the
legs and other lean parts in strips about
lin. by 2in., sprinkle them with pepper
and salt to taste, and sling them over
the clothes-line. In a few days he will
have a supply of jerked meat that will
keep indefinitely. When properly dried
it should be as brittle as a biscuit, and
may be used either boiled into soup or a
stew or eaten “raw.” Either way it is preferable to
salt tack.

“Dido”: Here is Sir Harry Johnston,
anthropologist, addressing the big “World-Brother-
hood” movement in London and talking of our dis-
position to assimilate with the aboriginal type : “Many
a white Australian born of purely British parents,
like the late Sir Harry Parkes, differed from the
Australoid only in skin-color and not much in head
form or hairiness.” Of course, “Sir Harry Parkes”
is our old friend Henry, who, as it happens, was
not an Australian, but brought his head-shape and
his hairiness to this country from England. Apropos
’Enry’s resemblance (more or less) to the abo., I
once wrote a yarn for The Bulletin bearing upon
the creed of King Billy, “Go down black pfeller,
jump up white pfeller.” Parkes was the hero who,
dying an aboriginal chief, “jumped up” reincarnated
as the bleached, white-haired Henry whom Bulletin
readers knew so intimately.

“Ewa”: I saw a N.Q. binghi do a trick
with his toes that will take some beating. Si*
pins were thrown on the roadway
and he was to ~pick them up.
He had only one try at each, and
never missed. He had two ways
of going about it. Either he
buckled the big toe so that the
pin stuck in the skin or he
caught the pin between the big
toe and the one next-door and
lifted it up that way. I haven’t
seen a nig thread a needle with
his feet, but I believe this fellow
could have done it.
“Two Seas”: Some years ago England’s
old nobility were not met so frequently in the bush
as they are now, so when I handed in my wire,
“Lord Essex and Duke of Norfolk leaving in coach ;
meet them at Gunnedah,” the lightning-jerker ex-
claimed “Strewth, I never saw a duke in me life—
where are they?” I told him they were in the
coach up at the pub, and when he expressed his doubt
about lecognising “the toffs” I assured him that
he couldn’t make any mistake, as the whole of the
inside seats had been reserved for them. Ten minutes
later he was gazing indignantly at two Havilah stud-
rams that lay snugly on their straw bedding regard-
ing his overheated countenance with well-bred indif-
ference. They had got tired of walking with a low-
bred mob of wethers, and I was glad to get them
off my hands. They had tried hard to be left
behind in peace, and I was sick of having to go
back and poke them out from behind bushes when-
ever I had taken my eyes off them for a moment.
The driver of the coach, impressed by the amount
of passage money paid for “two stinkin’ sheep,”
regarded his passengers with a dubious expression.
He had been told there were no passengers this trip,
and on the strength of that information had taken
a green colt to break in on the road. What was
going to happen to him, he asked, if the blinking
coach got upset at the crossing and these two noble
stinkers were injured or drowned? I f e Jt a bit
dubious myself when the coach departed in a cloud
of dust and profanity, with the green colt’s hind leg
over the pole, but I hoped for the best, and prayed
that if the woolly 'noblemen were jolted through the
window the driver would notice the fact. I was
relieved of my anxiety a few nights later when the
coach-driver pulled up at our camp and informed
me that he had delivered the aristocrats safely at
Gunnedah. “But, by cripes,” he added, “you won’t
catch me taking any more of those jokers as pas-
sengers. They scared seven devils out of me at
Smeltzer’s wine-shanty.” “How did that happen?”
I inquired. “Well, as a matter of fact, I nearly
lost them there,” he replied. “It was like this.
I pulled up for a drink, and old Smeltzer says, ‘No
passengers to-night, Bill?’ and I says ‘Yes,’ two
inside.’ ‘Won’t they come in?’ says he. ‘No’
says I. ‘Why?’ says he. ‘No money,’ says I. ‘Who
are they?’ says he. ‘Two aristocrats travelling for
their health,’ says I; ‘come out and I’ll gi ve you
an intro.’ He comes round to the back of the
coach, and I says, ‘Wake up, me noble lords, and
meet Count von Smeltzer.’ The old chap laughs' and
says, ‘They look a bit crook; you ought to take
the straps off ’em and let their blood circulate a
bit!’ So we lifts ’em out of the coach and takes
the straps-off, but bum me if they could stand on
their feet! Every time we held them up and let
go they flopped like a wet towel. I felt a bit
scared, but Smeltzer, who knows. all about sheep,
said it was because they wanted a drink badly!
‘lf that’s all that’s wrong with ’em,’ says I, ‘bring
out a couple of stiff nobblers. I’ll shout for the
poor blighters as they are both stiff.’ After I had
poured a nobbier into each of them we left ’em
lying on the ground and went inside. I felt that
1 could do with another myself after messing about
with those noblemen. Well, after a bit of a yarn
I says I must get my passengers aboard and be
moving on. Smeltzer comes with me to give me
a hand to lift ’em in, but when we gets to the
coach, bust me if they hadn’t cleared out! ‘They
must have been shamming,’ says Smeltzer. ‘No
fear,’ says I ; ‘it’s that blinkin’ strong wine o’
yours, and if we don’t catch ’em before they gets
on to Wild Goat Mountain and joins up with the
mob there I’m a ruined contractor, and you’ll lose
your blanky license.’ Old Smeltzer rushes into the
house and rouses out the two boys and his missus.
He wouldn’t give ’em time to dress, and there we
were, the old woman with a jacket over her night-
dress, and the two kids with their shirt-tails flying
in the breeze, all scooting after two drunken rams
on the loose. Lucky for us it was a clear night
and a full moon, or we’d never have seen ’em; as
it was, we tracked ’em a mile before we ran ’em
on to the stock-route fence. They must have got
on the scent, for they were headed straight for Goat
Mountain. We hadn’t much trouble catching ’em
once we got ’em against the fence, for those two
Smeltzer kids would run an emu down, much less
those blue-blooded wool-bales that are too proud to
raise a gallop. Of course, we could neither drive,
lead nor carry the blighters back to the coach, so
the Smeltzer family had to sit on ’em until I
brought the coach up to their royal hides. No
more of your perishing pedigreed passengers for me,
boss!” exclaimed Bill, and after another dip into
the tea-bucket he resumed his lonely drive west-
ward, whilst I retired to my tent to ruminate upon
what Bill’s generosity in shouting for his passengers
might have cost me, and made a mental note to
send the Smeltzer kids two of the best bridles I
could buy on my return to civilisation.

when he is hungry. During the last bad drought
in the Inverell (N.S.W.) district the native dogs
were most savage, and lean mobs roamed the
country looking for prey. Nearly every other
thing had died, so they were in a pretty bad possie.
Coming late along the lonely stretch of road that
connects Copeton with Inverell we were often shad-
owed by a pack, which would have attacked if their
natural cowardice had not prevented them. My
mate was a sharp-shooter, and often carried his .44
Winchester with him, but the dogs were as cunning
as a sewing-machine canvasser and as wary as a
two-up spy. One night about 20 of the half-starved
brutes howled along behind us, always breaking
into the scrub when we halted. We tried a little
subterfuge; I walked on whilst my mate slipped
into the shadows. The mob _ was clearly puzzled,
and the leaders threw up their noses and a doleful
wail echoed on the breeze. It was followed by the
sharp crack of the rifle, and one toppled over in its
tracks. All that we could find three minutes later
was a smudge of blood on the ground, some hair
and a solitary paw. The pack had eaten their
wounded mate, bones and all.

unsatisfying substitutes made for sale, not
for SERVICE.
Keep this in mind: Gillette has a world-
famous name and reputation to maintain.
Every Gillette product must conform to the
standard which has made this razor the
favorite of more than 20,000,000 men the
world over.
When you buy a Gillette Razor, and Gillette

things under exactly the same circumstances
if you take them from Sussex and put them
in the Polar regions. This, too, is an
immense saving of thought, because the Polar
color is comparatively easy to get from
works that are only recognised as fiction by
a few exploiters, whalers and other persons
unlikely to say much about it. Some stories
are all local color and nothing else. A few
persons with arms, legs and revolvers flutter
through, and some are alleged to be male
while others have female names; but for all
the character any of them develop in the
pages the authors would be hard put to it to
prove that they were human at all. The best
adventure books are among the very highest
efforts of fiction; the worst are a little
thinner even than the average successful
novel.
Observing the general trend of the books
that continually stream from the press, the
one conclusion to which everything points
is that fiction will very soon be outside the
range of literature altogether. There is no
reason at all why an intelligent publisher
should employ a young lady who has a type-
writer but little knowledge of punctuation
or grammar to arrange the sections for him.
All he has to do is to make an infinite
number of cuttings from existing novels,
number and classify them and get a person
of taste to place the numbers in their right
order for the next book. In the end the
arrangement may be left to machinery; but
the time saved when mere hand labor is
employed will be great. Even the most
illiterate young lady probably takes three
months to produce masterpiece. After
that the whole has ’(o be sub-edited and
punctuated. But a goUd man under the new
scheme of arranging numbers could probably
get out a couple of novels a day ; and the
punctuating and sub-editing has already
been done. Also, the royalties to the illiterate
young lady would be cut out; and so the
book could appear in a better form at a lower
price. The final phases fiction would be
wholly mechanical. A machine to arrange
the numbers so that several hundred new
novels could be produced eyery day would
not represent the very last W9M; for enter-
prise could go farther and place a machine
in every home. Then the reader could have
the incidents and characters exactly as she
liked them, or spring surprises upon herself
by putting the numbers in an unusual
sequence. Playing the fiction machine would
be an accomplishment at once quieter and
more exciting than playing the piai?o.
C. O. M.
James Joyce
During life the poet, unlike the prima
donna, usually escapes the penalty of pub-
licity, though his artistic achievement is
occasionally placed on the critical platter
and served up hot with the sauce of pom-
pous pronouncement in the quarterlies. This
has been the case with James Joyce, a
young Irish writer, once a student of theo-
logy, but lured from the pyx by the pen.
His repertoire is small; it consists of an
opalescent offering in verse, an experiment
in autobiography, a handful of Dublinesque
anecdotes and a play. Joyce suffers from
the assumptions of his egoism, but he has
the courage of candor. Ilis speech is often
rank in its frankness. He never sits con-
tentedly on the carpet of convention; but,
under the influence that prompted the shrill-
voiced Swinburne to spout insult and point
scornful fingers at a broad-backed mid-
Victorian Mrs. Grundy, Joyce has his shies
at the peanut piety of Puritans. Like
Maurice Barrfes lie has vivisected his soul:
in flexible prose he tells the tales of strange
blasphemies, dotting the “i’s” of indecencies
with punctilious precision.
Like most beginners Joyce’s early attempts
were derivative. He played upon a bor-
rowed lute. The poems in his book “Cham-
ber Music” .vacillate from Herrick to Fran-
cis Thompson. “A Portrait of the Artist as
a Young Man” is one of the most striking
books of its kind since Huysmans pub-
lished the confessions of his conversion in
“En Route.” The book is a self-portrait in
the nude. Joyce pulls off his shirt and ex-
poses the warts. He is as truthful as
Tchehov and as brilliant as Barrfes. A
Zolaette in realism, he never beats about
the moral ambush :
He scorns to drape the truthful nude
In smooth decorous platitude.
And he describes a public convenience with
the verve and verbal virtuosity of Huys-
mans alone. In penetrating prose he ex-
plores the primordial darkness of his soul,
sprinkling the salt of satire over the raw
turpitude of his experiences. From the
coarse revelry of his youth he emerged
into a militant Catholic; but, with a mind
too speculative for the acceptance of spirit-
ual dogmas, he barked his shins on the
stones of disbelief and fell away from faith
—the associations of which lie smarting
under the sting of his cerebral whiplash.
From cradle to college, from the brothel to
the confessional —often running knee-deep
in nastiness —he has fashioned the sombre
symphony of a soul that lusted after its
own destruction.
“Dubliners” contains a series of short
stories of the mean and dusty commonplaces
of middle-class life. With the clear, con-
cise technicalities of an etcher Joyce has
made some wonderful plates of servant-girls
and slackers, middle-aged clerks and cele-
bates who eventually fall into the matri-
monial trap laid by the landlady’s daughter.
It is a book of aspects executed with the
same power of observation as the paintings
of George Luks. Gorky-like scraps of
humanity drifting into vile streets and gen-
teel restaurants, grotesque women and noc-
turnal waifs, children dancing round a
wheezy barrel-organ—all the flotsam of the
great city’s life have come under the artist’s
scrutinising gaze in this book.
Russia, France and Italy have their eman-
cipated novels, but English fiction has for
many years been petticoated in absurd pre-
judices. George Moore, by continually
splashing his oar in the Sargosso Sea of
British rectitude, has cleared the way for
new works; and it remains for James Joyce
—a dealer in corrosive verbal values—to
sail in with an emancipated novel. Though
an Irishman, his work, so far, has had no-
thing to do with the strange vistas of Irish
folk-lore, with the dim dream-figures of
Deirdre and Duna and the mighty chieftain
Cuehullain ; neither with the lyric pantheism
of AE nor the languorous legendary plays
of Yeats. Surely a perverse comet suddenly
broken into the melancholy charm of the
Celtic twilight.

The Prize Novel that Isn’t
A first prize of £3OO was offered by Mr.
C. J. De Garis for the best Australian novel
written by an Australian. The Ashes of
Achievement, by Frank A. Russell, is now
published as the winner—(first out of 423
stories submitted. Good or bad, this place it
is disqualified from holding. The novels
were “not to exceed 100,000 words.” This
story exceeds the limit by a very wide mar-
gin. In a competition of the kind this
objection must be fatal; for the other 427
competitors have the right to claim that
with another 10,000 or 20,000 words they
might have beaten the winner.
The offering of a literary prize like this
involves serious obligations. A book is not
written in a day; and in this case 428 Aus-
tralians have devoted months of effort to pro-
duce work which has not been judged accord-
ing to the conditions laid down. Mr. De
Garis offered a total of £550 in prizes, de-
claring that he did so for the “gratification
of a personal hobby.” But the work done by
those competing was not, as a rule, done as a
personal hobby. Averaging the stories sub-
mitted at only 80,000 words, and averaging
the value of the writing at the low rate of
£1 per thousand words, the competition has
called out more than £34,000 worth of Aus-
tralian effort. A mass of genuine trying of
that kind creates a responsibility on the part
of the person offering the prizes. Whatever
he may think of the merit of the work
submitted, he must abide by the standard
of length w r hich he himself fixed. For-
tunately Mr. De Garis will have no diffi-
culty in rectifying his mistake. No cash
has been paid. Mr. Russell has accepted
royalties instead of the first prize, and the
second and third have not yet been awarded.
The Ashes of Achievement might very well
have done without the additional words which
entitle it to disqualification. A conventional
story, which holds the attention fairly well,
it is overweighted, with discursive crudities
that have little bearing on the tale. The
main characters are not badly drawn, but
they are those of dull people who make little
appeal. The style is rather wooden; the
incidents are of the kind already worked hard
in popular fiction; and the idealism is that
of the Methody classroom. As an Australian
novel, its major fault is the absence of any
intention on the part of anybody to do any
useful job. Photographic representation of
people and scenes is the author’s mainstay.
Tongues Across the Pacific
Every once in a while C. J. Dennis or
Bernard Cronin or some other body is de-
nounced for making Australians talk Yankee
slang. If'they do they are, in many cases,
only getting a bit of our own back. The
American slanguage is a very mixed brew,
but it Has in it a strong dash of old-time
Australianisms. There is little doubt that most
of them were carried across the Pacific by
the “forty-niners,” who rushed by thousands
from Australia, especially N. S. Wales and
Van Diemen’s Land, to California.
It was easier then to get to California
from Australia than it was from the
eastern States of America. To reach the
Pacific Coast from the east meant either a
slow crawl of nearly 2000 miles across the
prairies and over the llocky Mountains,
through a wilderness infested by Indians and
other obnoxious animals, or a sea-voyage of
over 10,000 miles round Cape Horn (cut
down later by crossing the Panama Isthmus).
And the Americans who came to California
were largely backwoodsmen, “Pike County”
men from Missouri, Hoosiers from Indiana,
“blue-grass” Kentuckians and the like, who
must have been strongly influenced bv the
crowds of sophisticated, far-travelled “Syd-
ney coves,” many of whom had at'the back
of their Australian experience all that Lon-
don could teach them.
No one can read some pre-diggings Austra-
lian publications—the Port Phillip
Patriot, for instance —without noticing the
remarkable American flavor of many words
and phrases. In those days one James
Hardy Vaux occupied a temporary banish-
ment to Newcastle (N.S.W.), in compiling
a brief dictionary of the “flash” language,
which he thoughtfully dedicated to the Com-
mandant, Skottowe. It contains such
choice Americanisms as “bender,” “dippy,”
“bum” (in combinations like “bum-trap,”
“bum-bailiff” )s “crap,” “galloot,” “kid,”
“lamps” (= eyes), “patter,” “nuts on it,”
to “croak” (to die), “leafy,” “fake.” How
permanent .slang really is, in spite of its
apparent evanescence, is shown by the num-
ber of modernisms, pot specially American,
that Vaux records. Amongst them are
“chats” (any returned man knows them),
“cheese it,” “chiv,” “chum,” “conk” (nose),
“cove,” “gammon,” “grub,” “his nibs,” “push”
(in the slang sense), “ringing in” and “ring-
ing the changes,” “making a stink about
it,” “tatts” (which meant dice in those
days), “titter” (the female young of the
species), “togged up to the nines,” “whack
it up,” “spin a yarn.” According to one
American writer the adjective “nobby” goes
back to the time when the high-fliers of San
Francisco were called the Nobs. But the
word “nob” was used in Australia before it
reached California. So some of our bor-
rowings from U.S.A. are really coming
home.

“Croson”: Glad I’m not building just now.
Strolling through a yard to pick out a piece
oi seasoned timber for a mantelpiece I
noticed some of the hands apparently swat-
ting flies on a load of 3 x 2 hardwood.
It was nice green sappy stutf, and had pro-
bably been growing on some Warburton
(Vic.) hillside the week before.' Gut the
insects the men were killing weren’t flies
but white ants, and after they had settled
all they could see the quartering was nicely
stacked on top of a pile of similar stuft.
The man who buys that hardwood will be
sorry. , . »
“F.C.”: When the Repat. puts a re-
turned Digger on the land it should keep
a fatherly eye on him until he has proved
himself. In one day, within 11 miles of
Melbourne Town Hall, I passed three
orchards, all now occupied by returned men,
which produced thought. A year or so ago
all three supported families, and were handed
over in first-class Condition. To-day they
are all overgrown with weeds and grass
and badly in need of the spraying they
should have had during the last three
months. Two seasons of that sort of treat-
ment and they will be gone beyond recall.

ister Massy Greene has promised to put up
£4OOO if someone else will make it up to
£lO,OOO. The N. S. Wales and Vic. Forestry
Commissions are each throwing in £lOOO ana
it is reckoned that the newspaper proprietors
will do the rest. The Forestry Commissioners
are ready to guarantee adequate supplies of
pulping-timber if the tests prove that hard-
wood can be made to fill the bill. Theje is a
horrible risk that some of the fiercest foreign
trade-journals will yet be printed on paper
made in Australia from Australian material.

were responsible for introducing faked dogs’
teeth for use in the currency of Northern
New Guinea. In ’O9 it seemed to me that the
country must at one time have been over-run
by billions of wild dogs. The farther inland
we went the more dogs’-teeth necklaces did
the villagers parade. All the old men and
women possessed at least one necklace
apiece, and each was composed of about 100
dogs’ teeth. I had the curiosity to examine
one of these valuable relics. Then I found
that the teeth possessed no nerve ducts. t»it
■were solid; in a word they were frauds.
The next German settlement cleared up the
mystery. In the plantation store were piles
of boxes containing these porcelain fakes.
And they were days when the Japs weren t
allowed to do much trading in those parts.
“Dido”: We were watching a yacht-race
at St. Kilda, myself and a well-known
physiologist, when I drew his attention to
Pretzel lounging in a car as commodious as
a hearse, with Madame Pretzel and the
little Pretzels. Pretzel was fat, and Madams,
lounging back in the cushioned seat, showed
above the top of the car like the more elevated
parts of a large mass of rising dough. I ex-
plain to the Professor that Pretzel had
had three, fires, very nearly four, in nine
years, and was not quite happy because he
was doing so w'ell now that further spon-
taneous combustion was unnecessary. _ Then
Pretzel discovered me. He was most friendly.
He introduced Madame and the little Pretzels.
He dwelt upon the perfections of Morris, his
son and heir, aged 11. “Morrith ith a
good poy,” said Pretzel, “dere aind’t a better
poy. lie’s as goot as a servinkt aboud der
owze. He vill alvays ged oop und light der
fire ven der strike iss on.” “What did you
tell me?” murmured the Professor. “Another
instance of the influence of heredity.”
THE HAPPY FLATITE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were living in a flat; it was number eighty-
three.
At eighty-four the Barleys lived, a fearsome man
was he.
He had a wife and numerous kids. We heard them
rip and cuss,
Some three feet and a quarter off, across the hall
from us.
And when the Barley boys broke out, and ended
up in fight,
Or when the Barley baby read the Riot Act at night,
And on the balcony their cat put up an eerie moan,
The fearful Barley family might as well have been
our own.
When Barley after parting with some others of the
ilk
Came panting up the narrow stairs, and drank our
jug of milk,
Then broke out at his missus, and as fiercely answered
she —
Where was the great advantage of our marked
sobriety ?
When Barley bedded early he would shake the com-
mon floor
And fill the gulf of night with an intolerable snore,
And people in the other wing at us their bluchers
threw—
What good if we slept soft as snow and silent as
the dew ?
This Barley when unoccupied would fill my study
chair,
And utilise much time, and take up space I could
not spare,
To tell me of the 'deeds he’d done, his drinkings deep
and vast,
And ladies who had loved him in his sanguinary
past.
And Mrs. Barley dropped in—in the morning, as
a rule —•
And stayed till lunch and chattered like a ladies’
boarding-school.
Then she borrowed bread and onions, and wondered
if she might
Leave her little Willie with us. She was going out
till night.
Our little flat’s forsaken; we have left St. Kilda-
road;
We knew not where to go to, and we haven’t an
abode;
But no flat in any building that we’d suffered in
was worth
The comfort ’of a camp-out. So we’re flat upon
the earth !

A'Great’Car
To ride in a Wolseley Fifteen is to
experience those thrilling delights that
only a “great” car can impart to the
fullest degree.
As an undoubted triumph of the best British engineering
practice, it instantly draws forth the highest praise from
the motor expert. As a thing of beauty, it appeals to
the finest artistic sense, and its multitude of modern
travel-in-comfort devices provide luxury in abundance.
The purchaser of a Wolseley Fifteen naturally expects
great things of it, and in no case is he disappointed.
The Wolseley Fifteen is equipped with the most modern
system of suspension springing yet devised; only the
best grade materials and the finest Vickers steels are
used in its construction. This assures the smallest pos-
sible expenditure for repairs.
Complete weight is under 23cwt.; taken from the
stripped chassis weight of 1 6cwt. and brake-horse-power
of 45h.p., the power-weight ratio equals 3h.p. to the cwt.
The equipment includes—Patent Canvas Hood, Adjustable
Windscreen, Upholstered Best Leather, Buttoned Cushions,
Electric Starting and Lighting Equipment (full set of lamps),
Spare Wheel and Tyre on Carrier, Electric Horn, Speedometer,
8-day Clock, Bulb Horn, Dashboard -Lamp, Folding Luggage
Carrier, and Number Plate with painted number at rear.

“Baree” : We were so used to Bill wallop-
ing his wife that it was rather a shock when
she issued a summons for assault. Her
mother let the cat out of the bag. “O’
course,” ma explained, “any man ’as a right
to ’ammer ’is missus, but it’s goin’ a bit too
far w’en ’e gets the haxe to do it with.”
“Skipper”: A shell exploded near Pongo
and dented his face. When the little Eng-
lish sister saw it she offered some of her own
fair skin to the face-quack and that camou-
artificer used it to cover the new tip
he’d made for Pongo’s nose. Nowadays
Pongo drives a stripper on the banks of the
Murray, and the sun has burnt him brown
—all but the tip of his nose. That goes crim-
son, and then skins, unless it gets its full
ration of face-cream and powder.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” on the Rocks:—
One of the oldest pub signs in Australia will dis-
appear presently, the result of the Reduction Board’s
inquiry. It is the Hit or Miss, and the original
groggery was built on a site on the Rocks given by
Governor Macquarie in 1819 to the foundei of the
Stevens family. When the property came into the
possession of the late J. M. Stevens, the musical
composer, he demolished the old house and built
another. Interned in the brickwork over the bar
door is a glass jar containing a number of old copper
coins and tokens, the accumulation of the earlier
years of bar trade. When the Government took over
the Rocks Area after the outbreak of plague,
Mr Stevens —who built the first flats in Syd-
ney close by the hotel—obtained compensation
for both buildings, and went with his family to Eng-
land, where he and his wife died. Their eldest son
Jack a sub-lieutenant in the Flying Corps, was killed
in France. The Harbor Trust is going to build bond-
stores on the 6ite.
“Mero”: About five months ago I wrote
two letters, one to the professor in charge
of a scientific department of one of our Uni-
versities, the other to an American Univer-
sity, the second being addressed simply to
the Registrar. In each I asked to be sup-
plied with some recent scientific details,
which, apart from academic interest to the
professional man, were of considerable value
from a practical point of view, bo far I have
not heard from our own University, distant
bv post a few hours; but last month a reply
reached me from the American institution.
It consisted of voluminous data, including
clippings, bulletins, typed extracts, and
a list of other sources from which
I might extract additional information. Ac-
companying it was a two-page letter, acknow-
ledging receipt of my communication,
thanking me for having written, and contain-
ing a brief commentary on what was being
done in America in the matter in which 1
am interested,' and an intimation that my
name had been placed upon the University s
mailing-list and that I would be forwarded
future data which might come to light., ine
letter concluded by wishing me success in my
research work, and a request that I would le
the writer, the Professor of Chemistry at the
University, know the result of it. Meantime,
the University in my native country has not
even paid me the courtesy of acknowledging
my letter, or a later one sent on the
same subject, despite the fact that I am a
graduate of it. Do you wonder the Ameri-
cans make such progress in those industries
that are based on the newer developments ot
science?
“Gregor”: A recent suggestion, which
emanated from members of the N. S. Wales
Medical Board, that the finger-print system
be used to identify medical practitioners who
qualify in one State or country and seek
registration in another, has its prigm in
the fact that the Ma State authorities have
fallen in badly over bogus doctors. Until
the last few years almost anyone who blew
in, allegedly from another land, and presented
a diploma in N. S. Wales, with no accom-
panying evidence that it had not come Irom
a printer in Melbourne, succeeded in having
his name placed upon the list o
allowed to practise. The profession natu-
rally acquired some strange members. une
was an ex-ship’s steward, who, deciding that
medicine paid secured a diploma from
somewhere, was registered, and settled down
in a Sydney suburb to dispense pills and
salts. Six years later he was detected and fle
the country. Another was a pleasant-spoken
young man from the U.S., who, after exhi *
ing his credentials from a New York medical
university, was told to go ahead and cut em
up. He had been doing so for only a week
or so when somebody discovered that there
was a slight irregularity in his diploma m
fact, the university which granted it
gone out of business 20 years previously.
But finger-prints won’t explain why Austra
lia should, unlike other countries, admit to
registration without examination anybody
who drifts in.
“Moe” about our job in New Guinea:
In spite of a good deal of hot air to the contrary
it is undeniable that the natives of ex-German »ew
Guinea have not much of either love or admiration
for their new boss. In fact, during the periodl of
the Military Occupation, lack of respect o
reached the point of obvious dislike. Instances
the natives helping the Germans were not lacking-
One of the most prominent was the concealment f
four years of a German officer who had refused
surrender. With the help of the mgs. he was
enabled to live within 12 miles of the Morobe o
station. Almost daily natives from the tillage
which he was concealed visited Morobe, where t
picked up what gossip they could from the na i
police, nearly all of whom, with the excep io
half-a-dozen Solomon Islanders from Buka, wer
the joke, and later passed on the information to
Hun. Frequently, too, a district-officers " e
plans to catch a German missionary at sometning
forbidden went astray, because the police .*
warned Hie Hun. In 1917-18 German mlsslon * rie
from Fmchhafen carried out extensive gold-nuning
onerations along the Warriar River, such bam
strictly forbidden, and were able to do so wit
once being caught, simply because their
the native police were thick as flies. Also, n ■
when the Sepik River villages organised a rev
against Australian rule, every German for miles
around knew of the threatened trouble before
Australians at Madang heard anything of i ,
when the information did reach them it ca ™®
friendly German sources, or, rather, from ® ;
who were not desirous that suspicion of fol "®™ ’
the trouble should rest on them. lor these
there is a good deal of soundness in the policy
the new Administration to send all Germans out
the territory.

Every woman learns that during
these troublous and expensive times
one of the greatest blessings is good
health. She also learns that to
obtain and maintain such a condi-
tion of health it is necessary to take
care of herself and keep the system
in proper working order. Constipation is probably
responsible for most troubles, and if a suitable
medicine is taken as required or, better still, at regular
intervals, much discomfort and suffering will be
avoided. For purposes such as this Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are specially suited. Every day,
women are learning of the admirable qualities of this
medicine and telling their friends.

“Pelton”: Melbourne Argus is ready to
give a neat little illustration of the advan-
tages of water-power if the next strike shuts
off everything else. A Pelton wheel has been
put in to drive a little turbine, and a four-
iuch stream from the fire main with a good
fall can be used to drive the wheel. This
will give power enough to bring the paper out
if all else fails. It would be an expensive
way of getting hold of water-power, but no
one knows what strike the next day will
bring forth.
“T. 0.1.”: The basement of the N. S.
Lands Offices in Bridge-street holds some
queer old iron safes or strong boxes, one
of them being the Treasury Chest of the
settlement’s infancy. In those days the
Treasury was in George-street. This chest
is a weighty affair, the lock of it in the lid.
Another, of more modern build, is chokeful
of unclaimed title-deeds of old days, the sub-
ject lhnds of which have no doubt been long
since “jumped” and in that event are now
held under possessory title.
“Private Boxer” : I wonder if prohibition-
ists ever patronise picture-shows! I don’t
see why they shouldn’t —most of them are
dry enough. If the anti-everythings dropped
in, say, to see the new screen version of
the old favorite farce, “What Happened to
Jones,” they would, I imagine, open their
eyes. The Whole business is given away—the'
moneyed man with his store of whisky, the
trade in the stuff, the “bootlegging” and the
generally squalid behavior of high and low
in their endeavors to get drink. This picture
evidently mirrors accurately what is going
on, and it is pitiful to see to what depths
of hypocrisy a free country descends when
cranks start interfering with its freedom.
“Mara”: The records of the Defence De-
partment contain few stranger stories of de-
sertion than that w'hich forms the military
history of a member of the Tropical Force
doing garrison duty in German New Guinea
during 1910. This soldier, Bill by name, was
in Rabaul. The monotony getting on his
nerves, he applied for a transfer to one of
the out-stations. His application having
been approved, he was sent to Morobe, where
he was presented by the District Officer with
a job which consisted mainly of keeping in
order the bush tracks of the district. After
a time Bill became again afflicted with ennui,
with the result that the New Guinea bush
swallowed him up. For a time his absence
passed unremarked, his failure to report being
taken to mean that he was away somewhere
superintending repairs to a track. Finally,
however, a search was made for him, the
current belief being that he had gone down
to an attack of fever and passed out. When
no sign of him. was found after an exhaustive
search by D.O. and Native Police, Bill was
posted as missing and his relatives in Aus-
tralia were informed. Soon he passed from
memory, and all might have been well had
the s.s. Morinda, with the D.O. from Morobe
on board, not put into Port Moresby, south-
ward bound, nearly a year later. Un-
fortunately for Bill, the D.O. recognised him
in the person of one of Port Moresby’s
butchers. Inquiries revealed that Bill had
walked right across New Guinea, living on
the country as he went, and, incidentally,
crossing one of the highest mountain ranges
in the island. He was returned, under arrest,
to Rabaul and received 12 months from a
court-martial. But “Sammy” Pethbridge, then
Administrator and a kindly soul, was so
filled with admiration of Bill’s capacity as
a cross-country traveller, that he suspended
the sentence and returned Bill to duty. \
CRITICISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir Conan Doyle, referring to his ups and downs
in Australia, writes of a press boycott, “caused
partly by an ignorant want of proportion and partly
by moral cowardice and the fear of finding later
that they had backed the wrong horse or given the
wrong horse fair play. They are very backward, and
far behind countries like Iceland and Denmark in a
knowledge of what has been done in spiritualism.
It is the unliveliness and spiritual deadness of this
place which gets on his nerves.” — Cable.
I am a very modest man,
A literary genius; I,
With book and bell and candle, ban
This low and mean community.
I, the inventor (after Poe
And all the writers I have read,
And Sue and old Gaboriau,
And many others who are dead) —
I, the inventor of the ’tec
Who wept on Dr. Watson’s neck.
I suffer boycott of the Press —
They print but half a page a day
(On Sundays it is often less),
And interviews once in a way;
The moral cowardice and fear
Of these Australian papers seem
To say they worship not me here,
Nor listen to my opium dream.
These laughing people of the sun
Just breathe and work and sleep and play ;
They do not know I am The One
Who’ll put the tag on Judgment Day;
They listened to my tales of spooks,
And all the “facts” my cult can find,
But, judging by their puzzled looks,
Dear Denmark they are far behind.
For here the sunlight makes them laugh;
They will not heed the medium’s moans;
They surf, and lager beer they quaff,
They do not love churchyards and bones;
And oh, to be in Iceland now,
Happy with eldritch screams and snow,
And joyous death-damps on the brow,
And blithesome bears upon the floe!
In Denmark, when the butter’s made
And still and silent is the churn,
Then, by the cheerful cypress shade,
A man may talk of ghosts, and yearn
To meet them ! But this southern land,
Where surfing girls display their curves,
Where boys and girls dance to the band,
Is surely getting on my nerves.
Ah, land that knows not the Unknown,
That cannot plumb the bottomless!
Ah, people listen to my moan, .
And shun the surfing girl’s caress!
Find out the thing you cannot find,
Solve the unsolvable, and then
Import icebergs and winter-wind,
And know true happiness of men!

Justice dated the 6th November, 1916, made
in the matter of the Estate of William
Sharpe, deceased, Sharpe v. Hood (1910 -S.
No. 2285). whereby the following inquiry
was directed :
“An inquiry whether Thomas Smith (a
Nephew "of the Testator, William Sharpe,
deceased) named in the Testator’s Will is
alive or dead, and if he is dead whether he
died under the age of 21 years or without
having been married under that age, and if
he attained that age or married under that
age, and is dead, then who are his legal per-
sonal representatives.”
Notice is hereby given that all persons
claiming to be entitled under the said inquiry
are personally or by their Solicitors on or
before the 30th day of April, 1921, to come
in and prove their claims in the Chambers
of Mr. Justice Eve and Mr. Justice' Petersen,
Room 248 at the Royal Courts of Justice,

will be peremptorily excluded from the bene-
fit of the said Order. Friday, the 6th day
of May, 1921, at 12 o’clock noon at the
said Chambers (Room 246) is appointed for
hearing and adjudicating (upon the said
claims. ’ n
Dated the Bth day of December, 1920.
PRETOR W. CHANDLER,
Master.
Note. —The said Thomas Smith was born
on the 3rd January, 1871. It is believed
that he left England for Brisbane in Decem-
ber, 1885, was apprenticed to a Coachbuilaer
in Charters Towers, Queensland, Australia,
and left Charters Towers about 1891.

“The Maid of the Mountains,” with its
elusive form, amiable disposition and melodi-
ous character, is set for a long innings at
Melbourne Royal. Picturesque melodrama-
tic comic-opera never fails when tuneful
enough, and this artless melodrama set to
music has strains of Gilbertian feeling in
its cofnposition, also purple patches of mixed
fooling and a strange lack of chorus and
ballet numbers which, somehow, aids its
attractiveness. A gaily apparelled crowd is
there —on the stage, or waiting at- the wings
—but the choristers get little to sing. In
the brief last act the young women do
practically nothing except wander up and
down the mountain side with fish-baskets
on their heads, whilst the young men merely
rush bare-legged into the briny canvas deep
to Pull boats on the beach. The weakness
or the final act really calls for more apology
than the music offers. It provides a con-
ventionally happy ending for two couples,
but leaves Governor Stigant in ignorance of
.6 fact that he is an utterly forsaken
widower. It throws no light, either, on the
question as to what became of the unseen
other Governor who was captured by the
brigands and robbed of his uniform. And
the fleeting appearance of Frank Freeman,
as Baldasarre, the Terror of the Mountains,
emphasises the feebleness of the closing
scene. F.F. is not the sort of desperado to
frighten an aged aunt, even though he said
Boh As a scanty-bearded Baldasarre on
the hilltop he is as mild as a maidenly pro-
test—-and, for that matter, the clean shave
in Act makes him no milder—but as
prisoner on an island whence escape is easy
Freeman has no surroundings to support
im. lie has to play the bold, romantic
adventurer in cold blood, so to speak. The
situation is four sizes too dramatic for him
it is in spite of .'her professed infatuation for
Baldasarre that Gladys Moncrieff cuts so
much ice in the name part. Given a more
impressive figure to be struck on, Miss Mon-

crieff would herself
command more rever-
ence, whereas the Gov-
ernor’s daughter
(Violet Yorke) is not
expected to want full
justification for giving
the glad eye to Free-
man. Violet will do
very well in her showy
little part when she
acquires a more reti-
cent manner. It
would be in vain to
recommend a reticent
manner to Phil Smith.
Smith is a farcical
identity who buffoons
at his own expense.

“Humpty Dumpty,”
the brightest of Mel-
bourne pantos, is try-
ing hard to live down
its evil appellation at
Melbourne Majesty’s.
Handicapped with a
bad title the story of
the misguided so r-
ceress and the green-
haired village idiot is
almost hidden from
view under a mass of
irrelevancies, but it
has to come to light
occasionally, and
when seen it is dis-
approved of. Other-
wise “Humpty” de-
serves well of this
generation. Even its
oldest little jokes earn
the respect due to age.
King Brett, for in-
stances, gives Prime Minister ' Maurice
.Dudley a lesson in the art of keep-
ing a bank, and then every bald-headed
man m the audience falls a-thinkinsr of the
long, long ago, when the late Harry Rickards
imported a very tall and a very short com-
edian who invented that banking business
I he memories of panto audiences, however,
don t go back to the long ago as a rule,
nor does the average matinee nipper take a
burning interest in banking. The nippers
are more interested in Maggie Dickinson
and the minor poets of motion.
At Melb. Tivoli last week a relaxed throat
kept Styan out of the bill, and Laurence
Harding masqueraded as terrible Chu Chin
Chow. Harding was passable in the part,
but not so effective as Styan, and Styan
isn’t an ideal Chu by any stretch of imagina-
tion. All the same, it is always easier to
see shortcomings in an individual perform-
ance than to name anyone who might do it
better. In the case of Workman, as Ali
Baba, the management seems to have got the
best man for the job. After a period of
huskiness Workman has improved in all re-
spects. lie is less insistent on being funny,
and therefore more convincing. Workman
is the mainstay of the comedy section of the
noble show, but Vera Pearce sets a fine
example of earnestness to everybody. In the
Oasis scene, where a dim, religious light
mercifully tempers the massivity of her form
divine, Vera’s work is high-class, and thence-
forward she gets so completely inside the
character that it adapts itself to her physical
proportions.
‘ Sir,bad,” at Melbourne King’s, has been
altered to the extent of appointing Margot
Lester leader of the Sennet girls and giv-
ing her the song to sing about them. For-
merly the damsels were bunched behind
Elsie Parkes on the “Saucy Sherbet,” but
Elsie’s fine physique robbed them of their
advertisement and tended to make the scene
a one-girl show. Moreover, a newly-reno-
vated Hassan is directing the Cat’s move-
ments and making him behave with super-
feline intelligence.
At Melbourne Princess’s “Cinderella” is
still driven to appear twice a day by the
whim of Public Approval.

Dorothy Brunton and hey colleagues are
still appearing at Sydney Criterion in

Irish-American-English comedian and ex-

obstructing crowds, pressing to get into the
other show, give him a chance.

“Lilac Domino” ditties are now being
played as digestion-music by all the tea-shop
orchestras. Before the summer’s over they
will be tentatively tackled by the Manly-boat
bands, and in 25 years’ time the “Domino”
waltz song will be ground out on the George-
street barrel-organs, as a companion-piece to
“Annie Rooney” and “After the Ball.”
Meantime Rene Maxwell, Jamieson Dodds,
Ivy Shilling, George Gee, Marie La
Varre and others continue to earn what-
ever the management pays them at Mcln-
tosh’s Tivoli, and the work of the chorus-
ladies and ballerinas makes the audiences
muse pleasantly on the infinite variety of
the Australian girl.

The blast in the first act of “Welcome
Stranger” continues to make the Palace the
most popular place in Sydney these Turkish-
bath nights. Some people say it is as good
as a visit to Kosciusko.
“Pinafore” has been anchored all the week
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and the Skipper’s
Daughter and the Tar continue to stick to
each other in spite of melodious efforts to
tear them asunder. But “Princess Ida” is
returning after a long absence.*
Paris must have been looted to supply
the plumage and jewels necessary for Gaby
Deslys to prove herself favored of “The God
of Luck.’’ Poor Gaby’s part is that of the
injured wife of a French husband and the
true love of a Scottish engineer. Hus-
band is in the motor business, and, getting
into financial difficulties, makes Gaby seek
Scottie’s financial aid, and Kilts imagines
that the lady has been playing with his well-
meant affections. However, the lady de-
nounces the husband, who shoots himself,
and thereafter the course of love is as true
“BABY BUNTING,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Frith meets a vampire.

There are horse-races, aerial flights and
woodland dancing among the film’s side-
shows, and the Crystal Palace is its
temporary home in Sydney. At the
same house Jimmy Burke is dis-
covered to be the “Someone in the House,”
but is changed from a diamond-thief to an
honest man in the good old Yankee fillum
way. At the Lyceum Madge Kennedy
achieves a new dollar, a share in a busi-
ness and a pastrycook’s heart in “Dollars
and Sense.” At the Globe and Haymarket
Mae Murray has a strenuous time proving
her “Right to Love,” while at the Lyric
gum-trees and ’possums and young Australia
disport themselves in Kate Howard’s “Pos-
sum Paddock.”

Harry Carey has resumed the massacre of
his fellow-creatures in “Bare Fists” at
Hoyt’s, Melbourne. Harry pulls out his
Colt in the first chapter, and soon he and
other heroes are spraying saloon walls and
the prairies with lead. Hall Caine gets a
footing on Hoyt’s screen as the author of
“Darby and Joan,” in which his son, Der-
went Hall Caine, swaggers in the scenes of
peace and provides the agony for the violent
situations. In “Yes or No,” at the Majestic,
Norma Talmadge repeats the old movie de-
lusion that a woman’s virtue diminishes as
her husband’s salary grows larger. It is
an absurd tale, decorated with glaring
Lotharios, and only Norma’s acting makes
it tolerable. The other Majestic subject,
“Brothers Divided,” is a bit of bother that
comes to a pleasant ending in the worst-
regulated studios. At the Britannia Con-
stance Talmadge in “The Love Expert” is
causing an outbreak of matrimony among
her simple and trusting relations. The
Melba has “The Silent Barrier,” in which
the Swiss Alps nrovide a setting for one of
the longest suicides on record.

Arthur Greenaway, who has the idea of
developing a regard for Shakspeare in Vic-
torian schools, has collected a party of
players who will give a trial run of “As You
Like It” at the Playhouse one night next
week. Greenaway will appear as Orlando;
Norma Campbell will do Rosalind; and
George Bryant will deliver the gloomy re-
flections of Jaques. Simple curtains will be
used for scenery, and will be easily handled
in the subsequent tour when “Hamlet.”
‘ Julius Caesar,” “Coriolanus” and “The
Merchant of Venice” will be added to the
repertoire.

present exhibition at the Vic. Artists’
Society. Various Italian sculptors have
knocked bits of marble into shapes which
are conventionally sweet in expression and
pose but weary one in the mass with their
monotonous triviality. Most of the busts
and nudes belong to the unfair sex. They
generally wear a look of Madonna-like calm
and gaze upward or downward ip the manner
of heroines in Family Herald fiction. No
doubt the works are beautifully-chiselled,
and the use of colored marbles for fabrics is
clever, but there are two roomsful of Beat-
rices. Ruths, Joans of Arc and so forth,
which is overdoing it. A Bacchante by
Manucei is the nearest thing to a companion-
able damsel in the show, but she hasn’t an
atom of devil about her. The best bit of
work in the exhibition is Bessi’s “Glory Kiss-
ing a Dying Soldier.” Bessi has also a tall,
upright Beatrice in delicate grey marble,'
and there are other fine examples of model-
ling. The tigers, lions, horses, bulls and
other beasts are not always convincing, nor
is their anatomy exact, but their muscular
energy is vigorously depicted.
From Adelaide:—
Adelaide Art Gallery, tvhich does not go in much
for the Old Masters, gets its first look at a Thomas
Lawrence (P.R.A. in his day) in a “Mrs. Eliza-
beth Fry and Child,” lent by Governor Weigall.
It is a study in white and black, posed against a
heavy red curtain after the manner of the period.
It was that fresh-air-hating time when mother and
child both had to have their heads tied up in
muslin caps, leaving only the oval of the face show-
ing. The coloring is marvellous—so bright and
apparently recent, in fact, as to suggest a modern
“restoring” process having been used.
By the death of a half-brother Alick
Matheson, one of the original Westralian
Senators, recently came into a Scottish
baronetcy, but it brought no joy to the sad
old man. His three sons perished in the
war.
“T.E.”: There was some talk recently of
“Ruddigore” being given during the present
G. and S. season in Sydney. Rather a co-
incidence that the piece, after having been
shelved for 30 years, has been revived by the
D’Oyley Carte company in England. It
was received with enthusiasm and is to keep
its place in the repertory henceforth.
Once more the cables suggest that Lenin
is dead. He is pretty well the most killed
man in cable history. But one day a report
that he has come to a sudden and unpleasant
end will probably be unusually correct. It
is the sort of end that seems inevitably to
be waiting round the corner for his type.
Louis Kimball, one of the best and bright-
est mummers ever imported from America
to these parts, is forging ahead towards star-
dom in his native land. When last heard
from he was being featured in N’Yark in a
new comedy, “Daddy Dumplins,” by Earl
Carroll.
“C. Ockney”: James Mathews, a son of
Julia Mathews, the Australian prima donna
who stormed London in 1867 as the Grand
Duchess in Offenbach’s opera, passed out in
December at Charing Cross Hospital. He
was a well-known theatrical business mana-
ger, and as such officiated for Charles Froh-
man at his London headquarters, the Duke
of York’s, for 18 years. Mathews was born
at Dunedin (M.L.) in 1865.
“The Right to Strike,” by a new drama-
tist, Ernest Hutchinson, has already beeh
secured for Australia. It is a very seri-
ous industrial play which argues out the sub-
ject of the title, was refused by various
managers, and made a sudden and marked
success in London when someone took a
chance with it. Presumably Australia will
see it in its proper Lancashire setting; but
the American manager who bought the
rights of it for his country made it a con-
dition that he should be allowed to alter the
scene of the action to some U.S. factory
town.
“Arphos”.: Whitechapel, where the costers
come from, is to have a cinema theatre cost-
ing with the site the mere trifle of £170,000.
The unpretentious edifice, which is to be
decorated in the Louis XIV. style, and will
have a white marble facade, will hold 3350
people, _ inclusive of a thousand “standers,”
and with gross takings of £l5OO per week —
said to be a conservative estimate —is ex-
pected to show a net profit of £48,000 per
annum —enough to pay 20 per cent, on the
capital of £200,000 and leave a bit in hand.
The managing directors (who are also the
vendors) bear the good old Anglo-Saxon
names of Moses Cohen and Isaac Lewis,
and the builder and contractor, David
Morris, is presumably another ancient
Briton.
“0.K.” : One of the new cardinal sins is
to attempt to be funny at the expense of a
Labor union. Recently Melbourne Call
characterised one of the Melbourne coun-
cillors as “brutish,” and a lot of other things,
because he wrote to the Age saying that the
latest demands of the Seamen’s Union, as re-
gards menu and comforts, reminded one of
the luxurious life of the crew of the “Mantel-
piece” in Gilbert’s Bab Ballad, and also of
the awful had in the old “lime-
juicers” 40 or 50 years ago. Atkins was
writing from his own early experiences
and knows the a.b.’s trade from A to Z, but
the Labor organ hotly accused him of ignor-
aPc*Lal c l asse d him with pampered darlings
of officialdom born to travel first saloon. But
it wasn’t Atkins’s statement of facts which
hurt the Call so much as his quotation
from W. S. Gilbert. Gilbert’s picture of
conditions on the “Mantelpiece” was funny,
-and no organ of unionism approves of a sense
of humor.

“Film Up”: Saw Billy Hughes on the
screen t’other night and don’t agree with
“Billy T.” (B. 20/l/’2ll that he (.Billy H.,
not Billy T.) is “a great little picture
actor.” The film showed Billy (H.) on
a visit to a returned soldiers’ motor-
building works, and for a man who
has had (as he asserts) stage experience,
the Priminister showed up as a pretty poor
mummer. He was all restlessness and self-
consciousness, ■■ tugging at his bit of mou-
stache, adjusting his clothes, posing his hands
etc., and —worst fault of all—looking straight
at the camera. No. Billy (H.) wouldn’t
earn salt as a movie artist. Producers
wouldn’t be bothered with him. But then,
of course, he’d want to do the producing him-
self.
“C. Oekney”: Though the score of “The
Maid of the Mountains” was, in its original
form, the work of a young and previously
untried British composer, Fraser Simson,
four numbers which have become popular
are interpolations. They were composed by
James Tate, who has been writing music-
hall songs for nearly a quarter of a century.
Pie is also the “That” in “Clarice Mayne
and That,” a familiar top-of-the-bill act in
vaudeville. Clarice is Mrs. Tate and sings
to Tate’s accompaniment. The combination’s
biggest hit of late years was the maudlin but
money-making “Broken Doll.”
“H.M.S. PINAFORE," AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY’S.
Bill Bobstay (John Ralston) and Dick
Deadeye (Albert Kavanagh).
“M P.A.”: “Daddy” Bohr’s passing was
painless. He went to bed at Waiwera
(M.L.) on New Year’s Eve and never woke
up to hail another year. A month or two
before the finish I had a chat with the old
showman in the lounge of an Auckland hotel,
and tried to induce him to have a look at
“Tilly of Bloomsbury.” “No, my boy,” he
replied. “I never go near the theatre these
days. The people of my time have gone, and
the young ones don't know me.” He looked
better than he had done for years—far better
than when he left Inverloch (Vic.) to go to
Waiwera —but he was 70, and the end was
swift and merciful.
'‘Ancient Prompter”: Reynolds Dennis-
ton, the Maorilander who, with Harry
Plimmer, made an heroic attempt to run a
comedy company in Australia on Brough-
Boucicault lines, and almost succeeded, is
now touring Asia and having better luck
than he had in his own land. When last
heard from Denniston’s company was play-
ing “Eyes of Youth” and another American
piece, “Up in Mabel’s Room.” at Calcutta.
Rege Wykeham and his wife, Pressy Preston,
are members of the east, and “Denny” him-
self uses the grease-paint as well as telling
the Anglo-Indian reporters what fine fellows
they aiA.
“T. 0.1.” lowers the curtain: —
Exit George Darrell, at 75, and by his own act.
When I knew Darrell first he was “generally useful”
in a hat shop in Bourke-street, Melbourne. Stage-
struck, he appeared occasionally as an amateur, and
developed into a dresser or valet to Walter Mont-
gomery, the tragedian—that was in the ’mid-sixties.
They quarrelled in Adelaide, and Monty haled George
before the police-court for “deserting his hired
service.” The dispute was settled, and Darrell, for
a time, resumed his duties. Then he went to Maori-
land, where he met John Bennett, the old-time
theatrical manager, and the widow of Robert Heir,
who, as Fanny Catheart, had come out with G. V.
Brooke in 1855 (not with the Keans, in 1863, as
stated in S. M. Heuald).
Darrell married Mrs. Robert, and after considerable
experience in Maoriland the pair crossed over to
Sydney. When John Bennett leased the old Vic.
in 1871 Darrell became stage-manager, and later
Mr. and Mrs. Darrell went to America, where the
lady was a success, but managers would not look at
Darrell. Returning to Australia, Mrs. Darrell died
and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery,
where George erected a memorial with a remarkable
inscription over her grave. Afterwards Darrell went
to South Africa and England with his own dramas,
some of which, notably “The Sunny South,” were
successful; others the reverse. In the ’eighties he
toured South Africa with Cissy Peachey, who became
his second wife and brought him a son, Rupert
Darrell, formerly an actor with one of the William-
son companies, and now in the U.S.A. In South
Africa the second Mrs. Darrell died.
I last saw Darrell in Hunter-street, Sydney. He
complained of neglect, but by whom he did not say.
Though not much of an actor he was versatile
and enterprising, but he never made the fortune that
was several times almost in his grasp. In his
old age his want of means induced despondency, and
spiritualism brought no relief. So the veteran mum-
mer “went on a long voyage” (his own sad words,
written to a friend), and his body was cast up by
the Pacific on Dee Why beach.
“S.S.”: Once upon a time a play was pro-
duced at Melb. Royal in which the good
young woman rounds upon the bad woman,
who is not so young, takes her by the throat
and shakes her for the drinks. It was an
impressive moment, but one night, when the
shaking was at its climax, the wicked lady’s
set of artificials flew out into the drapery .of
the aggressive heroine, and the latter fouiid
them suspended in her neckwear while she
was still waiting for the villainess to take
up her cue and rave a bit. Naturally the
vamp’s powers of articulation were not equal
to the occasion, and a most distressing two
or three minutes followed, while the good
lass was making surreptitioifs efforts to pass
back the missing fangs. Then a boy in the
gallery cut in: “Take a spell, Agnes, f and
wedge your grinders in. We can wait.”
“Rienzi”: In the English production of
“The Maid of the Mountains,” now at Mel-
bourne Royal, Jose Collins, daughter of the
cheerful Lottie of yore, had the leading part
for 1350 nights without a break. Arthur
Wontner, who appeared with Julius Knight
and Maud Jeffries in “Resurrection,” “The
Holy City” and other dramas in Australia,
was also another bright spot in the show.
Pop Cory was another; he is the husband
of Winifred O’Connor, who warbled bril-
liantly in “The Chocolate Soldier,” produced
by Meynell and Gunn at Melbourne Royal.
“Smike”: “Victoria Cross” won’t be
worried by the initial failure of “The Greater
Law,” mentioned by “Fax” (B. 20/l/’2l).
Her 15 plays are to be collected in a “reper-
tory” and unrolled before the public until the
bitter end. Victoria, by the way, is a lady
of culchaw. Besides chattering in 10 lan-
guages she holds a B.A. degree. W hen she
writes her inevitable biography she will have
to recall that her dad was a British cavalry
colonel and that her great-grandad fought
with Nelson at Trafalgar. Victoria has
already mentioned these facts at great length
but we are bound to get them again. And
that will leave only about a thousand pages
for herself.
“Fax” : In Melbourne the other day died
Alfred Harford, a truly interesting stage
identity. Socially, and as an assistant-
stage-manager, he was an estimable fellow,
but he was a hopelessly wooden actor, one
of the sort that never improve. He put in
many years under Bland Holt’s management,
and in middle-age he was just as crude a
mummer as he had been in his young days.
Bailey and Grant had him for a while, and
he will be remembered as a particularly un-
convincing Billy Bearup in “On Our Selec-
tion.” At the end he was associated with
E. J. Carroll in the movie business. Har-
ford was a striking illustration of the fact
that no amount of practice will make an
even fairly good actor of one who has no
natural aptitude for the stage. But decent
and likeable as ; he was, he always managed
to keep his end up, and never sank to the
level of the “always unemployed,” to whom
J. C. vVilliamson used to say: “Why don’t
you try to find a job in some other line?
“Once an actor, always an actor, Mr. Wil-
liamson,” the haughty deadbeat would reply.
J.C.W. would eye the applicant for assist-
ance sadly as he answered: “But you never
were an actor, my boy; you only thought
you were.”
“Norbell”; I foregathered with the Shock
and Scalem Dramatic Co. at the only hash
foundry in Bullswool, The cd. had just
arrived by the afternoon train* and was
pessimistic as to its chances of a bumper
house. After tea it was sprawling on the grass
ih a gloomy frame of mind when Shock—or
perhaps it was Scalem —proposed going round
to the hall. “Got all the props ready for
to-night, Syd?” he demanded. “Yairs,” was
the drawling reply, “all except the squirt.”
“Good God!” exclaimed the manager, “No
revolver! How can I shoot Geoffrey Ware
without a revolver?” “’lt ’im over the ’ead
with a bottle,” suggested Syd. “No,” said
Shock —or Scalem—"l will not descend to
faking. I must have a revolver. Have you
tried the bank and the police station?”
“No!” said the tired Syd, “the John’s
outer town, an’ the bank’s shut.” “And this
is how I’m always treated,” said Mr. Shock
bitterly. “Look here, Syd, suppose. J. C.
Williamson’s manager was told by his pro-
perty master that he’d neglected to borrow
a revolver from the police station of the
bank, by frost, sir, what d’ye think he’d
say?” But Syd. was picking his teeth with
a pocket-knife, and there was no reply.

I can remember
when they ran a

Rivers (N.S.W.),
i n 1885. John

G 1 o u c e s-
ter, which at that
time comprised two
pubs, a police sta-
tion and a post
office, and gave a
performance a t
Gorton’s Hot e 1.
The audience was
composed of a few
station hands, the
hotel employees,
the local policeman and the writer, Wb
paid a bob apiece at the door, and it was
a good, honest show.
It was at Melbourne Princess’s not very
long ago, and a man in the back stalls had
developed a noisy turn. Persuasion, bribe
and threat had proved in vain, so a husky
employee was told off to fire the disturber of
the peace and quiet of an almost empty
house. He was dragged forth, and a police-
man in the vestibule butted in. “What are
you doing with the man?” he asked. “Throw-
ing him out,” was the reply. Robert gravely
scratched the bridge of his nose. _ “Ar-re ye
sure ye can spar-r-e him? ’ he said.
“Oid Pot” : “Princess Ida” was first seen
in Sydney on April 14, 1888, at the Theatre
Royal, and could scarcely be called a suc-
cess. Howard Vernon was King Gama;
Edwin Kelly King, Hildebrand ; and Leonora
Brah am, the London original, Princess Ida.
The massive Alice Barnett was Lady
Blanche; Duncan Young, husband of Leon-
ora Braham. was Hilarion, and Walter
Woodfield (the original Pooh Bah in “The
Mikado”) was Cyril; Aggie Kelton, wife of
the conductor Harrison, May Pollard, Katin e
Potter (Mrs. Arthur Hunter) and Maggie
Melrose, who afterwards married Sid Deane,
were also in the cast. Since then it has
been revived twice in Sydney—in 1893 and
1905 at the Lyceum and the Criterion re-
spectively. In the lutter production Vernon
nlaved his old part; Dolly Castles was Ida;
Frank Wilson, Hildebrand; Walter Whyte,
Hilarion; Charles Kenningham, Cyril;
Celia Ghiloni, Lady Blanche (Celia had not
then discovered the secret of keeping thin) ;
and Vinia De Loitte, Lady Psyche. The
first production at the Savoy was oil
January 5, 1884, and in the cast were Henry
Bracy as llilarion, and Charles Ryley as
Florian. George Grossmith was Gama.
AMATEUR ETIQUETTE.
LADY AMATEUR: “Do you ever get anything
in the exhibitions?"
GENTLEMAN AMATEUR: “Generally a head-
ticket
The London reception of “The Sentimen-
tal Bloke” was different-from that of “On
Our Selection.” It was shovyn last month
at the Alhambra as “Australia’s first great
screen classic.” The usually severe Referee
says: “The film makes an instant appeal to
high and low, rich and poor. . there has been
nothing quite like.it before wholesome,
humorous, pathetic the sort of thing one
feels the better for having seen.” The paper
kindly adds that “the quaint locutions are
quite understandable,” and that the acting
of Arthur Tauchert “is beyond all praise,’
his style being compared with that of Albert
Chevalier.
“Rienzi”: Frank Fi-eetnaii, who has been
freely dispraised for his performance of thfi
leading bandit in “The Maid of the Moun-
tains” at Melbourne Royal, was taking his
'ticket for England when the Firm rushed
him with a fresh contract, an increase of
salary and an uncongenial part. There are
two or three men in Australia who could
have made Baldasarre a more harmonious and
picturesque ruffian than Freeman does, but
the misfit mummer is a valuable juvenile
lead, and is wanted for more suitable roles
later on in the year. And it would have
cost money to bring him back.
“Stargazer”: Dot Boucicault was produc-
ing “Mutch Ado About Nothing,’; and wanted
a man for a small part. His want was
made known, and produced many appli-
cants, among others a youth who proudly
claimed to have been trained by Dan Barry.
“Have you ever acted in ShakspeareV asked
the actor-manager. “Oh, yes, often,’ was
the airy reply. “In What, for instance i
“Oh, ‘Pygmalion ahd Galatea’ and LCah the
Forsaken.' ” “To be sure,” said BoudiCault,
“I’ll send for you if I want you,”
“Nella” has the last word
i am chastened, but gratified, that a mere casual
remark of mine to the effect that “The Yeomen of the
Guard” had its kick-off at Melbourne Princess’s, oh
April 20, ISB9, and that three of the principal
performers, Nellie Stewart, Billy Elton and Leumane,
were pretty good, should have goaded such a respect-
able authority as “0.K.” into delivering; a half-
column sermon on my bad judgment (B. 27/1/ 21).
I quite agree with most of his remarks, but when
he says of Nellie Stewart’s Elsie Maynard that “She
was soon replaced by May Pollard, who did at least
put some tenderness into the character,” “O.KJ is
in danger of spraining his critical faculty. “The
straight sentimental part of Elsie,” he asserts, was
quite out of Nellie’s operatic line in those days.”
“In those days” was 1889, and at the Princess’s the
year before Nellie Stewart had starred as Marguerite
in Gounod’s “Faust,” with some eclat, singing the
part, by the way, at nine consecutive performances,
a feat never equalled in Australia before or since.
Does “0.K.” seriously contend that as Marguerite
Nellie Stewart was “without tenderness —charmingly
artificial —decoratively theatrical,” or that “straight,
sentimental parts were quite out of her operatic line
in those days ?” I think, and always thought, that of
Elton and Lauri, Elton was the better artist; but it w
a curious fact that of every comedian who has juggled
with Jack Point it is said that the playing of that
particular part is his greatest achievement. Possibly
this is because in a serious effort your clown must
cease from clowning. Thus Walenn is admirable as
Jack Point, but his dummy-clown antics in other
Gilbert and Sullivan roles—for instance his witless
effort to keep down his persistently protruding big
toe in “The Mikado”—make- the judicious want to
kick him hard.
“WHEREFORE ART THOU ROMEO?”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
i sec thee still in doublet wide,
And hose well kept, a world too slack,
b long and lean thou wert allied,
It struck me, with that curious hack,
The Zoo giraffe. Thy brow was black,
Thy speech was awkward, action stow.
I whispered at thy first attack:
“And wherefore art thou Romeo?”
Thou wert then fifty and cross-eyed;
For acting never hadst the knack.
With stilted bow and Irving stride
Thou tookst the stage, and Jill and Jack
Both sniggered, when with damned clack
Thou talkedst of moons, and wrecked the show.
And here, by Heaven, thou art back.
Oh, wherefore art thou Romeo?
This fellow was a lad of pride,
No prinked-out fool, with just a snack
Of bounder, and by Fate allied
To pale effeminates who smack
The rouge about. Thou art a quack!
Thy treatment brings the lover low.
Thou’rt living still our hearts to crack;
Oh, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Envoy.
No egotism dost thou lack,
Great scorn hast for the rival pro.,
And talk’st thou of thy art. Alack !
And wherefore art, thou Romeo?

When proof substantiates claim
MUCH has been claimed by
Goodyear on behalf of Good-
year Belting. Goodyear
knows not only from factory tests
and trials, but from the long scroll of
public performances, just how high is
its merit and efficiency.
But, Goodyear rests the case for
Goodyear Belting but little on claim.
It marshals evidence and arrays un-
impeachable testimonies in support.
The proof, herewith is exemplary of
the attitude of technical men toward
Goodyear Belting.
At the works of the Rockhampton
Co-operative Dairy Co. Ltd. there are
about 800 feet of belting in use. With
small exception it is Goodyear Glide
or Klingtite. The plant operates usu-
ally for from 16 to 24 hours per day
—averaging 16 hours.
On the Brine Pump, there is a 3 inch
x 4 ply Glide Belt. The engineer-in-
charge considers this the mo&t severe
drive on his plant, as the splashing of
the brine ruined all belts used previ-
ously. The Glide Belt, however, has
given 18 months’ service and is still
.in excellent condition. The Brine
Pump and belt is shewn in illustra-
tion and the specification is given be-
neath.
Similar excellent service has been
rendered on all other drives—from
the main drive down—by Goodyear
Belts, properly specified and applied
after investigation by our trained
representative.
The value of plant-analysis cannot be
over-estimated, insuring as it does
the exactly suitable belt. The result-
ant service has . become proverbial.
Where complete data are furnished,
or where an investigation is made by
the Goodyear Technical Man (who is
at your service for the asking) con-
sistently high and sustained results
are forthcoming.

Dear Sirs: —
We wish to advise you of the excellent service that is being
obtained from the Goodyear Belting, Glide and Klingtite Brands, which you
supplied us with about two years ago, and may say we are now using these
Brands practically throughout our Plant.
Your Belts are operating our Main Drive, Air Pump, Circulating Pump,
Double-Acting Centrifugal Pump, Brine Pump, Chum, etc., etc., under very
wet and severe conditions, and the service we have to date is more than
double the service secured from either Leather or Camel hair previously
used, and your Belts are still in good condition.
We consider the conditions under which the Glide Belt operates on our
Brine Pumps to be particularly severe, and previous to installing a Goodyear
Belt, we had purchased two Leather Belts in one season of nine months,
while the present “Glide” has been in service for over eighteen months and
still has a lot of life in it.
We have not had the slightest trouble with either of the above brands
with stretch or slippage.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) J. W. NUTT ALL, General Manager.

MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Nine Australians have already been picked
for England, and in The Bulletin's opinion Ryder,
Mayne, Park, McDonald and Andrews will fill five
of the remaining places, whilst the second wicket-
keeper’s billet is now in the balance between Carter
and Ratcliife. Winser, of S.A., was favored for
the last-mentioned job, but as he couldn't get leave
to play with his own State against Victoria, the
selectors had no chance of confirming their strong
suspicions regarding his ability. Park, who was a
doubtful passenger for England, has with Ryder
made his selection almost a certainty. Despite
recent performances there has been no likelihood of
Mayne staying behind; and McDonald has to go as
a relief for Gregory. Andrews’ chances have im-
proved by his recent all-round work in Adelaide and
Sydney, and he satisfies the demand for a medium
bowler with a spin which the Solomons of cricket
have been urging since the third Test match.
O’Keeffe, Forssberg and E. Trenerry were
included in the N.S.W. team that beat Victoria by
six wickets last week and incidentally won the Shef-
field Shield. The selectors, in picking them, over-
looked some better men—notably Punch. Ratcliffe
did splendidly with the bat and behind the stumps.
He is a bit “showy,” but the way he took the erratic
Trenerry on the leg stamped him as a master.
Hendry showed the brightest batting for N.S.W.
He fairly let himself go after being missed twice
before he had got a dozen. Liddicut got the best
bowling figures for Vic. His length, however, went
to the dogs when Hendry started to lay the wood
on. Ironmonger was always difficult, though he reli-
giously kept them away from the leg stump.
McDonald, even with a roaring southerly behind
him, proved a long way short of Gregory’s class as a
fast bowler. He has no direction where his expresses
are concerned, and his slow ball usually means a
new paling in the leg fence. The Vic. fielding was
wretched, Mayne and Liddicut alone scintillating to
any marked extent. Mayne, Keating and Sandford
opened well in Vic.’s second innings. The latter is
a particularly taking bat who relished Gregory and
was quite at home to Mailey. Ryder made a free
and blameless 135 (n. 0.) as an offset to his poor
bowling. Taylor’s fielding was a feature, although
the whole of N.S.W.’s work in this department was
above the average.
* * * *
Armstrong easily heads the Sheffield
Shield batting averages with 132 runs per innings.
Bardsley, who is runner-up with 108, has actually
scored 120 runs more than the Australian captain.
It’s a big drop to J. M. Taylor with 83, followed
by Ryder with 77. The other first-class batsmen
are pretty well bunched. In bowling, Mailey (15.53)
just beats Liddicut (15.83) ; also, he has taken more
than twice as many wickets. Armstrong (16.85)
is in third place, and McDonald (22.17) has a
better average than Gregory (23.33), and has taken
22 wickets against the giant’s 9.

In Sydney grade cricket on Saturday
Petersham felt pretty safe declaring at last Saturday s
score of 5 for 470 against Norths. With a little
help, however, Punch (207) might have made them
sit up. Armstrong (61 not out), picked for his bowl-
ing, was the only other batsman besides Punch who
made light of the bowling. Scott (4 for 64) did
best of the eight Petersham bowlers tried. Pite
against Gordon was unplayable; his five victims
averaged but four runs apiece. The Boneyarders
should have been sports enough to give Gordon
another smack at Pite and incidentally try for an
outright win. All the Balmain batsmen got runs
against Glebe before the declaration, Love’s 74 being
the best effort. Storey made Ratcliffe appear a
stonewaller while he rattled up 33. Glebe were given
a second knock on the off chance of something
startling happening in the bowling line, but there
was nothing doing and ’Main won on the first innings.
Gee (152) and Donovan (57), of Middle Harbor, with
little help from the other bats, narrowly beat 'Varsity.
Garner bowled well for the students, and with decent
luck would have had both the village cracks caught
early. Cranney is easily C. Cumberland’s most con-
sistent, if unorthodox, batsman, and his 35 and 51
against Wests helped to stave off complete destruc-
tion. C.C. went down, of course, but not as heavily
as they might have. Wall (6 for 97) again bowled
well for Wests.
Richmond had the biggest win in Mel-
bourne district cricket on Saturday. They beat Uni-
versity by 172 runs on the first innings.' Richmond
made the unexpected total of 300 (Dean 80 and
Bartholomew 67), and the, students’ response was
128 and 6 for 73. P’ran, without Lampard, Willis
and Ellis, were too good for Melbourne, who lacked
the mighty assistance of Armstrong. P’ran totalled
203, but Melbourne could only manage 149, the bril-
liant P’ran bowler, Grimmett, getting 6 for 61.
Grimmett’s performances have been asking for recog-
nition in bigger cricket for months, but so far he
hasn’t had a chance to play for his State. Hartkopf,
with 7 wickets for 93, did more than his share in
Northcote’s win over Carlton by 69. Northeote
closed with 4 for 284 (Woodbury 135 n.o. and Sherry
67 n. 0.), and Carlton patted ‘up 215. St. Kilda,
closing with 2 for 235 (Cohen 109, Hotchin 54, and
Ponsford 58 n. 0.), tried for a straight-out win against
’Wood, who had scored 86 on the previous Saturday.
But the Magpies finished the afternoon with 3 for
168, and Saints had to be content with a first-hit
win by 149. Fitzroy lost to South by 104, South’s
total of 343, including a capital 81 n.o. by Leonard
and a good innings of 59 by Brereton. Essendon,
closing with 7 for 310, wgs rewarded with a mere
draw against East. East finished with 6 for 197,
the elderly McAlister saving the side with a care-
ful 85 n.o.
* * * *
England, playing a Geelong XV last week,
gave Hobbs a chance to improve his aggregate by
138, made by sound and brilliant cricket. Makepeace
also got 98, Rhodes 68, and Waddington was next best
with 53 in a total of 457. Geelong batted pretty
confidently, and at the finish had knocked up 260 for
10, Sharland, a local champion, scoring 102. Woolley
was the most dangerous of the English bowlers, and
the most effective in the Geelong attack was W.
Eason with 4 for 115.
The Bananaland cricket colts’ sides at
Brisbane last week were captained by Roger Haitigan
(one time of Australian XI) and' J. S. Hutcheon
respectively. E. Stanley (47 not out and 2 for 29),
R. K. Oxenham (46 and 3 for 57) and C. R.
McDonnell (39 and 3 for 47) shone as all-rounders;
and W. D. Graham (39) and G. Burns (32) batted
well. Hornibrook’s left-handers upset five wickets for
62. The brightness of the batting is suggested by
the fact that 453 runs were knocked up for 18
wickets.
* * * *
Last mid-week Kealoha took the S. Aus-
tralian 100yds. championship in the moderate time
of 58sec., and Langer showed the way home in a
500yds. handicap wherein his nearest opponent had
a start of 30sec. On Saturday Kealoha was just
headed by B. Bywater off the lOsec. mark in a
110yds. handicap. The
Hawaiian covered the
distance in 62 l-ssec.,
lowering his Sydney
time of 63sec. and the
Australian record by
4-ssec. Langer on the
same day won the
880yds. South Austra-
1i a n Championship,
with Spencer Major and
Reg Beaglehole second
and third, and at the
same time smashed
Norman Ross’s world’s
500-metres record ol
6min. 55 4-ssec. put
up in the Sydney Do-
main enclosure last
year by one-fifth of a
second. .To the un-
initiated there may ap-
pear to be something
wrong here, as Ross
covered 500 metres in
6min. 50 2-ssec. at
Coogee, and even bet-
tered that at Auck-
land, where he swam
the distance in 6min.
44 2-ssec. last season.
The apparent mix-np is
occasioned in conse-
quence of the Amateur
Swimming Union of
Australia recognising
two sets of records,
viz., (1) long bath
50yds. and over, and
(2) short bath, under
50yds. ; the Auckland
and Coogee pools be-
ing less than 50yds.,
and the Sydney Domain
and Fletcher’s Dock,
Adelaide, enclosures
being 110yds. long.

The Hawaiians continued the cleaning-up process

Ivan Steelman, Australian Olympic swim-
ming representative, lifted the 100yds. Victorian
title last Saturday in 58sec.— r State record. “Bogey”
Beaurepaire was second in 58 2-ssec. (his fastest
time to date), with young Hans Robertson third.
Tom Logan, now in China, equalled this time
(58sec.) last year, when he stoushed both Beaure-
paire and Stedman in Melbourne Club’s 100yds.

N.S.W. swimming reps, for the Austra-
lian championships at Hobart and Melbourne are Sid
Beck (back- and breast-stroke), Moss Christie, F. S.
Cotton and Dick Eve (diving). Beck could only
finish third to Sid Springfield and W. Morahan in
100yds. free-style event in Q. last week. Eve won
a 50yds. handicap in 33sec. at Wellington (N.S.W.)
about the same time.
The American Lawn Tennis Assoc, has
notified all concerned that Davis Cup nominations
must arrive before March 15 “only valid extenuating
circumstances excusing lateness.” Spain, India and
Japan are already entered for the vessel, and Aus-
tralasia. France, the British Isles, S’Africa, Belgium
and Holland arc practical certainties.

“15-30”: Comparing Tilden and Brookes
on their play in Melbourne, and judging by the
results of their battles (single and doubles) in
Sydney I am wondering whether Tilden will be as
good as the present Brookes 20 years hence. Con-
sidering how Beals Wright, McLoughlin and other
hard hitters have faded out during Brooke's career, I
feel that Tilden’s energy and temperament will be
fatal to any long supremacy in international tennis.
Just now he is wonderful. But the amount of venom
he gets into his service and hard driving shots is
bound to use up his resources of youth and power
and retire him from the world-beaters in a short
term of years. His temperament will also . hasten
his finish, for apparently it is only the impassive
champion who endures. Consider Brookes,’ imper-
turbable in any -disaster, and hoarding his nerve and
courage for the crisis in a game. Even at his age .
his wrist work and delicacy of touch can drive
Tilden to desperate manoeuvres to avoid losing posi-
tion. The way Brookes played with Tilden in the
doubles in Melbourne, ironically'Emphasising Tilden’s
dictum to keep worrying the weaker man, was a
revelation of the genius of the true place-hitter
opposed to a stroke-player of the newest school.
Tilden is at his top as a stroke-player now, but the
enormous amount of ginger required for his game
will inevitably weaken his wallop at a stage of
development when our own Brookes was still the
wonder of the world. If Brookes were 10 years
younger, which would be still giving the Yankee" two
or three years, I believe he would beat Tilden under
any conditions. Apart from his strength and tech-
nique, he would knock out the Yank by his superior
brains.
J. R. Hooper has evidently mastered the
ivories, as he said he would just before leaving
Australia. In his third round match against Seaman,
* oSo h< L defeated b Y 2000 to 991, lie made a break
ot 228 off the red —an amateur record off that sphere
—and strung together 130, 99 and 92. H. C. Virr
has to his credit the best amateur break, 255 in
England, and G. B. Shailer the best in Australia,
268 (bonzoline balls). S. H. Fry, regarded as
Hooper s most dangerous opponent, made 230 in
“0.K.”: The unsportful practice of run-
ning unripe horses in minor handicaps a few weeks
before a big meeting gets open encouragement in
a Melbourne daily: “At present the Autumn racing
carnival is seriously jeopardised. It should begin
at Caulfield about a fortnight hence. In any case
homes must be prejudicially affected in their
preparations by the inability to have a run in
public before the big handicaps come on for decision.”
lo suggest that a racer’s satisfactory preparation
for a coming event must necessarily include one
or two, or more, gallops with the colors up is the
merest nonsense. The old racing term “a dark
in° r n e ,’ir sed Sl £ n u ify , one . that had not yet appeared
in public. English classic races in the past were
won by three-year-olds that had never previously
faced a crowd. The hottest favorite that ever won
a Melbourne Cup Revenue—had not rafced for more
than a year before he did the big trick. How about
the unbeaten Ormonde? He had no runs in public
to assist his preparation.

fiiwh 6 treasurer Lang’s desire to
fill the A. S. Wales State coffers out of the pockets
of lacegoers is seen in the slower revolution of the
turnstiles. The attendance at the two day 3 of the
A.J.C. Anniversary meeting was some thousands less
than last year, though the tote took several thousands
more in cash. The Treasurer, with liis 9 per cent,
cut, is doing well; not so, however, the clubs. It is
already rumored that Gosford will be converted into
a pony course. Kembla Grange lias virtually ceased
to exist as a registered club, owing to taxation and
heavy train freights. The Leger and Flat are prosper-
ing as the result of defections from the paddock to
the Leger on the part of patrons who would rather
spend the cash wagering with the machine than pav-
ing it out for admission fees.
. OI J Saturday at Riccarton, near Christ-
church (M.L.), where the silvertails chiefly compete,
the principal race, the Middle Park Plate, for two-year-
olds, 6f., went to Baronet George Clifford’s Winning
Hit (Autumnus —Winning Way), with Greenwood’s
1 etuma, a colt by Absurd—Bronze, second, 10
lengths back, escorted by the All Black filly Princess
Pat. There are seemingly a splendid crop of young-
sters in the Dominion, and the next Derby should
be full of interest. Absurd is the fashionable sire
at present in M.L., and is responsible for the crack
two-year-old Mermin.

Sydney’s 85th Anniversary Regatta was
a record for casualties owing to a 50-m.p.h. south-
ei'ly which hit the harbor about mid-day The
morning race for 16ft. skiff's under P.J.S.S.C. went
to Winona (J. Clare jun.), with Furore (Dick
rennell) second. The other six entrants were lost en
voute. Out of 14 starters in the 14-footers’ race
Warn'gal, well handled by E. D. Wall, was the only
one to finish—and she turned turtle soon afterwards.
For the afternoon race in this class there were
no starters. Only two completed the course in the
12ft. skiff event, namely Shamrock (P. Griffith)
first, and Peggy (H. Waterhouse) second; and the
winner capsized after the finish. Desdemona, 44rnin.
(A. C. Roberts), excellently pigged for the'day,
was first home in the 18-footers’ afternoon event,
with lmin. to spare fiom Mississippi, 2jmin. (R
Budnick).
• * * *
The success of the day in the conclud-
ing event of the inter-State 18-footers’ tourney was
Kismet (W. J. Duncan), which, from scratch, worked
through the fleet at an alarming rate and finished
third. Advance (4min.), well handled by H. E.
Thompson, was first home, with Desdemona (A. C.
Roberts), second. Twenty-five started, the
only absentee being Chris Garland’s Westralian
Eileen, which sprung her mast prior to the start.
Vision (Colin Clark’s champion) and L.F.H., the
other Bananalander, finished 17th and 18th respec-
tively, with the Westralian Eurus (Cyril Bellion)
dead last.
Bona notched her second win this season bv land
ing the Jenny trophy off the mark of honor Sun
beam was well suited by the free-sheet opportunities
the day provided, and was not headed until the fleet
came abreast of Watson’s Bay. The Maorilander
ultimately crossed the line with an advantage ■of
ljmin. from Crane’s craft, with Scotia rr t
Brockhoff) third. x ’

The Northcote Cup candidates Awanni
111. (A. C. Saxton), R.S.Y.S., The Rip (W S
Bagg), Brighton Y.C. ; Rawhiti 11. (p Alhprfl'
R.P.A.Y.C.; and Killara (P. Damrnan), 'st Kilda
Y.C., did a preliminary spin last Saturday over the
Manly-Shark Island course, under the ausnices nf
Sydney’s R.P.A.Y.C. Rawhiti was first away to a
rotten start, Awanui not crossing until 30sec later
However, after the pinch past Bradley’s Saxton’s
craft began to pull the leading trio back and
rounded the village mark with 30see. in hand’ from
The Rip, which preceded Rawhiti by 40sec. Near
South Reef Rawhiti picked up the leader, but with
eased sheets the Cup-holder again cleared out cross-
ing the home line 2Jmin. ahead of the Rip with
Rawhiti further astern. Awanui’s re-
cently-acquired Marconi mast was a success and
Rawhiti would also appear to have benefited bv
the alterations to her bow and rigging. The Rip
sailed better off a wind than on it, but Killara was
hopelessly outclassed in the light sou’-easter that
prevailed.
“DIGGER” EVANS.
The Frenchman Dupre encountered Digger
Evans at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night and
gave an imitation of a learner in the hands of a
somewhat severe professor. Evans distributed his
cat-like smacks about every portion of the Gaul’s
anatomy, and Dupre responded with swings and
swipes which usually missed by feet. After 12 rounds
the referee declared for Evans and the crowd de-
parted murmuring that it was the “rottenest match
in years.” It was so, but the Stadium authorities
weren’t altogether to blame. Practically any match
made for Dupre outside the gymnasium of a suburban
pastime club would be a failure.
Dick Arnst (M.L.) last week claimed the
world’s sculling championship from Barry by default.
Paddy Hannan (M.L.) came along with the first
challenge to Arnst, and they will probably row in the
Dominion. Hannan previously met William Webb
for the title on the Wanganui in 1915, and more
recently he defeated Fogwell (N.S.W.) for the M.L.
title, but had to forfeit in a return match through
an injured knee. Alf Felton has also dashed a
challenge at the extensive feet of Arnst, and if
Hannan drops out the N. S. Welshman will get the
race.

Leichhardt reps, had a beanfeast in the
rowing section of the postponed Anniversary Regatta
on Saturday. They won the junior fours (Bmin.
46sec.) and maiden fours (Bmin. 48sec.), while L.
Bull took the single sculls handicap (lOmin. lsec.)
from his clubmate Lewis. In the Gladstone Skiffs S.
Porter (Balmain) won in llmin. 15sec. The pro-
fessional handicap gave Milton Kent (llsec.) an easy
win from Billy McDevitt (2sec.) and George Towns,
junior (45sec.). Towns is a 16-year-old son of the
old-time world’s champion.
Twelve teams of two started in the six-
hours’ bike race at Sydney Sports Ground on Satur-
day. After the first hour a bad spill serit the un-
lucky Hans Ohrt and Lewis off the track. At
11 hr., when 45 miles hgd been reeled off, J. M.
O’Brien-R. J. Hazelton and G. Staples-Ernie Tamme
started out to lap the field, which in a couple of
miles they did after the most brilliant bit of com-
bined riding ever seen on the ground. The advan-
tage meant that in all sprints the leading teams were
in the premier places. Then Alf Grenda (whose mate,
Bill Erskine, had a bad spill) and Jackie Clark be-
gan to shake things up, and in 19 remaining sprints
Grenda won 12 arid Clark seven. The leading teams,
however, plugged along', and Staples-Tamriie (49
points) won from O’Brien-Hazelton (41), Grenda-
Erskine (18), and Clark-Papworth (12). The dis-
tance covered was 129 J miles.
Auckland (M.L.) is enthusiastic over E. V.
Cunnold, a 15-year-old youth who defeated Leo
Kronfeld for the half-mile swimming championship
recently in 12min. 2sec. The spurt clipped
15 l-ssec. off the M.L. record. Kronfeld made
amends, however, by taking the “furlong” title in
2min. 35 2-ssec., and knocked 2 2-ssee. off the
record.

The English Jockey Club, a most conser-
vative body, is considering the wisdom of taking one
more tip from Australia and insisting on every horse
having a name before it starts racing. At present
it can go on indefinitely as the child of its mother,
as in one long-ago case where “the Mineral colt”
grew up to become a Derby favorite without having
had a christening.

Brown’s life has somehow lacked the pageant touch.

Whence comes
all that is
exclusive
Navy-Minister Laird Smith put in part of
the Christmas holiday under chloroform.
The trouble traced back to an election row
in the Speck at the end of 1919, when Smith
was assaulted with boots and bottles. A
few weeks in bed set him on his legs again,
but there was still something out of place
at the back of his head, and it has had to
be straightened out.
Mrs. Blackstock—she used to play about
Government House while hubby was private
secretary to our former G.-G.—(is visiting
Melbourne for a while with Mrs. Robert
Harper as hostess.
A fierce outbreak of matrimonialities be-
fell Melbourne in the heat wave, which must
have hatched the germ. One of the first to
yield was big Charlie Cunningham, brother
of the Argus editor. His fellow-victim is
a gilt-edged Riverina widow named Jackson
with good looks and a 10-year-old daughter.
Charlie, who uses his war rank of major
for every-day purposes, left a lucrative job
on Hansard to get into khaki; but he was
dumped down in charge of the Anzac letter-
boxes. first in Egypt, then in France, and
wound up !his military career in the local
Repat. Office. His pretty wife, who was a
Bendigo Bewick, passed out from heart
trouble some years back. There are three
Cunningham offspring, two flappers and a
schoolboy son.
The Women’s Automobile Club, which has
swaggah but expensive rooms in Collins-
street, is becoming anxious. It is feu/ifully
exclusive, but new members are being beaten
up. The club has dragged in a business
male or two to help with financial affairs.
Mere money matters have to be seen to, don’t
you know, even though it is a fea/tful bore.
Old Kyneton folk claim that Warwick
Armstrong inherits the cricket knack from
his mother’s folk. From that stock _ came
Tom Flynn, prominent in field sports in the
old days in Kyneton, and afterwards a sub-
urban cricketer of note. Kyneton is a great
place for growing people who do things or
pass on the faculty of doing to posterity. If
Dave Maling, the Argus leader-writer, were
asked to prepare an honor board for
Kynetonians who have scored in the world
he would ask for a slab as tall as a telegraph
nole and as wide as a church door.
Strike restrictions have scotched the trip
to Adelaide the Vic. Parliamentarians and
their wives (a party of 70) intended to take.
The politicians had proposed to play cricket,
bowls and other games, and let the S.A.
Government play host for a week or so.
There has been no outburst of sympathy
with the disappointed trippers.
It is proposed to erect a triumphal arch
on St. Kilda-road, close to Prince’s Bridge,
as a war memorial. Gaud Mayor Swanson
intends to launch a public appeal at a big
meeting in March, and talks of raising
£250,000. The balance left over from the
Commonwealth button fund, £823, is all that
is in hand, and there have been no whispers
of £lO,OOO or £5OOO contributions. The Mel-
bourne Uni., St. Paul’s Cathedral Building
and other appeals made recently have been
frosts. It might be well to wait for quieter
times.
Peace is killing off the Digger V.C.’s. The
third of them to go since the Armistice is
Sgt. Maurice Buckley, V.C., D.C.M. (four
times), who, having been discharged from
the army under his own name, re-enlisted as
Gerald Selton in May, 1916, and explained
matters when he had covered himself with
glory. His V.C. was won when, at the
head of a handful of men, he rushed a nest
of machine-guns which was holding up an
attack, and made prisoners of 30 survivors.
And after emerging unscathed from an exploit
like that he died from a fall received while
trying to jump a pony over a fence at'Mor-
well.
Mothers of the type that bred Anzacs and
R.R.C. nurses are still about. Mrs. Charles
Jones, mother of eight kiddies, who lives up
Costerfield way, near Heathcote, hearing that
a boy, Arthur Renowden, while bathing in
the Bombay dam, had gone under, dived in
and brought the youngster up. She was an
indifferent swimmer, but neither that nor
thoughts of her own squad of eight, most of
whom are of an age to want minding, de-
terred her. In future Costerfield will have
something more to be proud of than its
antimony-mine.
The William Dalrymples’ bachelor son Sid
and the Arthur Moules’s attractive eldest
chick, Nancy, plead guilty to a charge of
intending matrimony. Sid had the job of
convoying Edward P. through the Italian
clouds during the final lap of the great big
scrap. Nancy’s dad, a solicitor, is a brother
of Judge Moule, and her mummy is a sister
of medico Hooper.
His Gaiters Hindley, of St. Paul’s, joins
in the fine leg parades that are adding zest
to life at Queenscliff and Portsea this year.
He and his lady are sojourning at the first-
named for a spell.
For six weeks James Davies, secretary of
the Commercial Travellers’ Association, will
have to lie up “patiently” in a private hos-
pital to allow repairs to be effected. While
riding at Marysville his gee tripped and rolled
qn him. The drummers’ brigade was much
relieved to hear that James was repairable.
The worst of his injuries was a fractured
thigh
Sybil Nichols —a flower-girl whom all
Melbourne knows for her talent in decorat-
ing—is bound for the altar with Harold
Watson Deane, of Doncaster (Vic.).
The Alfred Hospital is making a solid
appeal to Melbourne for help. Carlyou, of
the Esplanade Hotel, St. Kilda, intends to
do his bit in helping. The new jazz ball-
room which is being built in the general re-
modelling of the hotel will be completed on
February 17, and he will give a dinner-
dance that night in thanksgiving at seeing
the last of painters and decorators; and the
gross takings will go to the Alfred Hospital.
Tickets at one guinea each may be got from
the St. Kilda Appeal Committee.
Mrs. Dyer gave a good-bye luncheon at the
Lyceum for the two Patersons —Esther and
Betty—who light out for Fogland this month.
The Jack Ritchies’ elder daughter Blanche,
one of our crack “goffers,” met her fate when
smiting the little white ball across the Flin-
ders links. It (the Fate) is a visit-
ing sailorman, Commander Beattie. The
confetti will not be brought out just yet.
The newly-created fiance should be able to
keep the wolf from the future doorstep, as he
already owns a fine car.
Mrs. Frank Fraser has done Trojan work
in Victoria for blinded soldiers. Therein she
follows the fine example set by her sister-in-
law, the wife of Sir Arthur Pearson, of St.
Dunstan’s, in Eng-
land. Mrs. Fraser
helped to remodel the
house in South Yarra
which has been
turned into the Lady
Helen Red Cross
Club for Blinded
Soldiers. Before
that was established
she and her daughter
ran a depot for re-
ceiving and selling
all sorts of goods
made by blinded sol-
diers. Much of this
work is now done
at the new Club,
where Mrs. Fraser
is an ipdefatigable
helper. She has
turned the Collins-street depot into Curios,
Ltd., and still uses it as an exchange for
ex-soldiers’ work. In the spare time which
she devotes more or less to her own affairs
Mrs. Fraser employs a genius for architec-
ture in remodelling Melbourne homes. She
will readjust a house for flats or for more
comfortable living, and has a little army
of returned soldiers to turn on to the work.
Another group she has organised to take
over all things incidental to a moving; and
this battalion is getting all the work it can
handle and the blessings of relieved house-
fathers in addition.
“After all, give me the sunshine,” sighed
Mrs. Booklover Champion as she refolded
the frost-bitten budget which last mail
brought her from sister Vida Goldstein.
After this winter, and probably a year fol-
lowing to be spent in Boston, Vida expects
to strike the trail for home and sunshine,
where she intends to direct her energies into
channels other than Parliamentary.
Unsuccessful in displacing Greenwood in
the Boroondara electorate, G. R. Palmer,
formerly president of the Soldiers’ League
in Vic., has accepted a job in the Solomon
Islands. Possibly he will be back in time to
have another try at next State elections.
Marjorie Huggins (pronounced Hiigins, if
you please) daughter of the Sandringham
Gawf Club sec., has plighted her troth to
a young woolgrower named Blythe. Mar-
jorie, who can hole out as skilfully as any
of her sister gawfers, is equally skilled as
a bridge-player. She is half-sister of Mrs.
Jack Joshua. Jack and his wife lately wel-
comed the Hansens and their son back to
the Wattle. Mrs. H. is Jack Joshua’s sister
and a notable amateur violinist. With her
English hubby and son she has unpacked
at St. Carol’s in Caroline-street, South
Yarra.
A man-visitor from up North has been
doing Collins-street in the loveliest tropical
linens this hot spell. Said another Islander
jealously: “Oh, yes —he has a wife who will
slave over the ironing-board for his wretched
duds; but laundry prices in Melbourne, at
four bob a suit, cut out a poor bachelor s
parade!” The visitor should wear a placard,
“My wife irons ’em.” Nobody would get
Mary Ann to tackle the job.
Outliving her husband many years Mrs.
Annie Richardson passed out a few days ago
at her daughter’s home, Burke-road, Haw-
thorn (Vic.). She was in her 88th year,
and had often harked back to the time when
her John, a Geekftig man, in the ’sixties and
’seventies was a member of the Legislative
Assembly. He dropped out of Parliamentary
life nearly 44 years ago.
The Russell Grimwade pair are off to
India en route to a colder country. He is
an authority on chemical research, but he
showed an unsuspected literary flair in a
book all about Australian gum-trees, illus-
trated with a set of first-grade colored
photos for which he was also responsible.
The medical Reggie Weigalls are making
ready to hand their unmarried chick Helen
over to Edgar Walton on March 9. Also,
they are preparing for a trip to Mrs.
Weigall’s native London. Their bungalow in
Hawthorn has been hired for their absence
by the new Consul for the Netherlands, who
is married to Dr. Mary Delprat.
A dinner-jazz at the Oriental is billed for
Feb. 9 to give a kick-off to the Lord Mayor s
appeal on behalf of the Alfred Hospital.
The chief item of hospital help of these
jazzers will be the new operating theatre
planned to perpetuate the name of Florence
Young—she of beloved memory. Guinea
tickets, of course —the Naicest never dine and
jazz at less. Prayers are going up for a
cool spell.
Hilliard, an ornamental person without
much work to do in Tliq, Maid of the Moun-
tains, has just been imported from Fogland.
Ilis papa is an English clergyman with a
swaggah church in Mayfair, London. The
rev. dad has two sons and one daughter,
and much to his amazement the whole..bunch
are on the stage.
The Sorrento Hindsons got news from
Sydney last week of the death of son Wil-
liam Francis from ptomaine poisoning. He
had waved farewell to his wife in New Zea-
land, and was heading for this city to join
his mother, who was harbored at Delgetti
after a spell of anxiety, both her daughters
having been ill. Misfortune crowded on the
family. All arrangements for the funeral
were complete and the coffin was due to
arrive by express from Sydney; but the
train steamed in without it. Someone had
failed to see that it was transferred to the
Melbourne side at Albury. Mrs. Hindson
was a Miss Henty, daughter of the original
Portland Henty.
Lady Allardyce is giving the Girl Guides
a boost in the Apple Island. Daughter Keva
Allardyce had some experience of Girl Guide
work in the Bahamas, and she and sister
have been told off to tutor officers from
among the younger members of the G.-G.
society of the Speck.
The P. J. Falconers (she was Dora Kent
before the wedding bells) are here from their
home in Hongkong visiting mamma in
Toorak. A trek to South Africa and then
to England is on the holiday programme.
Doadie has had a chance to air her prettiest
tropical dresses in the accommodating Mel-
bourne climate.
Why are large sums of stage money, in
coin, always in bags not large enough to hold
a pound of chocolates? The Maid of the
Mountains is handed her share of unlawful
swag in a bag-purse that wouldn’t pay for
a trip to New Zealand and back if it were
stuffed with sovereigns—and it isn’t even
stuffed with anything. Ali Baba, in “Chu
Chin Chow,” waddles into his brother's
harem and throws at Kasim’s feet h small
bag of tokens said to represent 40,000 pieces
Everybody knows the price of Ali’s son’s
best girl cannot be possibly be crowded into
that paltry receptacle. There is never any
attention to detail about cash settlements on
the stage. A very old theatregoer says that
payments in specie are still as unreasonable
as when he was a boy. The villain used to
demand 5000 crowns for somebody’s ransom,
and the hero would fling un undersized wallet
on the ground, crying “Here is the amount
you ask, twice told!” One cannot expect a
stage person to come along on pay-day with
40,000 pieces in his pocket—he’d want a
dray to carry the money—but these large
debts can surely be settled in a fairly con-
vincing way and less suggestive of a mani-
pulator of the racecourse purse trick.
Frank Talbot, the most graceful showman
Australia has ever produced, has just re-
turned from a long tour of Africa, Britain
and America as an ambassador of E. J. Car-
roll. Talbot first took Harry Lauder through
Africa, and then turned to the Cold Country
to introduce picture-managers to “The Senti-
mental Bloke.” With Machiavellian diplo-
macv Talbot did not mention the merits of
the film with the help of a brass-band and a
couple of banquets, but casually—even care-
lessly—invited the trade to a private view of
Bill and Doreen at a London hall. Unpre-
pared for fine story in an Australian
setting, the film merchants of the Fog had
the surprise of their lives. Anyhow, there
was vigorous competition for the British
rights, which Talbot eventually sold to the
Gaumont Co. for a very high figure.
Doctor Lilian Alexander —the intellectual
pictured here by Alice Mills—is president of
the Women’s Medical Association, which has
just ceased a frivol in Melbourne on its
2 sth anniversary.
Dr. Lilian, who was
a magnificent, silver-
haired presence at
the various meetings,
is a real Australian
—born and bred in
the Commonwealth—
and has been a mem-
ber of the W.M.A.
from its beginning.
When she first
wished to take a
medical degree the
Melbourne Univer-
sity lifted its eye-
brows and wouldn’t
hear of such a thing
—quite an unsuit-
able profession for
women, y’know. She
took an arts degree and bided her time;
then, when medicine was at last grudgingly
opened to women, she was one of the first
to get through. Now the medical women
are lpgion. At the beginning of the war
the Women’s Medical Society offered its ser-
vices, which were politely refused —once
more women need not apply. However,
most of Melbourne’s women doctors sprinted
off and offered themselves in England in any
capacity. Some came out with as high
honors and rank as men dobtors; all did
Trojan work. Doctor Lilian was one of the
seniors. She went to England and America
to do war work, but particularly to give an
eye to her three nephews—the doubly-
orphaned sons of her sister, Mrs. Cudmore.
These warriors were made as fit as the advice
and care of a doctor aunt could make them.
Doctor Lilian did fine pioneer work for medi-
cal women in Australia, but now she has
slackened off her practice to a Collins-street
guardianship of some older patients who
will not let go their hold of their long-time
medical adviser.
Ironmaster Lord Airedale, a Leeds mag-
nate, with his dame and their two chicks,
Enid and Thelma, comes from England,
accompanied by Lady Kensington. Their
objective is the home of Oscar Nevett, the
young lawyer, now practising at Ballarat
and Camperdown, who, after distinguishing
himself at the war, wooed and won Evelyn,
a daughter of the visiting peer. The
Nevetts’s baby was the magnet that drew the
relatives from Yorkshire. Lord Airedale
was in the Commons before he became a
baron. Lady Kensington (he is now Sir
Alfred) is a daughter of the late Maj.-Gen.
H. C. Johnstone.
A word or two from Adelaide: —
The cricket germ is still on the rampage. On
Wednesday his Ex. and his eleven played a team
representing the Land and Estate Agents of Adel-
aide. This week they play the Unley City Council,
the latter, married and rotund, should prove easy
victims for the vice-regal athletes.
There was some talk of the Agent-Generalship
going to his ex-Ex. Sir Henry Galway, but the
Executive Council has now re-appointed Sir Edward
Lucas for three years, and granted him four months’
spell on full pay. Lady Lucas and family are now
in Adelaide on a visit, and Sir Edward is anxious
to come hither, too.
The Roman Catholic Church has bought the late
Sir Edwin Smith’s residence, “The Acacias,” at
Marryattville, and removed the Loretto Convent there
from the Norwood Parade. Many erstwhile guests at
“The Acacias” find it hard to picture it as a nun-
nery.
The Y.W.C:A. completed the purchase of the
Shierlaws’ beautiful home, close, to the Mount Lofty
railway-station, just before 'Christmas, in time tn
have a joycusly-full house of working girls spend
their holidays there in comfort and delightful sur-
roundings.
Mrs. N. MacDonald has returned to Adelaide on
a brief visit. After being associated with patriotic
work in the Cheer-up Society in the early part of
the war, she went oversea and did more patriotic
stunts in London and in France. She is returning
to London shortly to reside with her brother, General
Mitchell; and as she expects to spend much of her
time in France, she has expressed her willingness
to visit Australian graves and perform any service
for relatives in Adelaide. An afternoon tea has
been arranged at the Cheer-up Hut next week to
enable her to meet parents and friends.
Peter Waite, feeling the cares of old age, has
resigned the chairmanship of Elder, Smith and Co.
in Adelaide, though he retains a seat on •'the Board
of Directors. The new chairman is Tom Barr Smith,
son of one of the founders of the firm which grew
into the co. and nephew of the other.
John Sprod, a quiet suburban doctor of Adelaide,
just dead, was the doyen of all S.A. practising
medical men, though only 71. His removal leaves
J. C. Verco and W. T. Hayward to share that honor.

THE NEW LIGHT-SIX is Here!
A shipment of these famous Studebaker Cars has arrived aboard s.s. Kathlamba.
The new Studebaker LIGHT-SIX is here—on exhibition
now in our salesrooms! And what a beauty it is! You
really must see*it to appreciate its rare grace of line and
mechanical excellence. The big weather-proof crates that brought
these new cars safely across the water are being torn apart and
the cars are already on display, so that your early visit will find
us thoroughly prepared to assist your inspection in every way.
Gone are the days when even in a light-weight car one must sit
cramped for knee room. This new Studebaker has changed all
that. It is unusually roomy for a car of short wheelbase, and, in
fact, carries the same appearance of luxurious roominess as you
would expect to find only in cars of at least fifty per cent, higher
price. Yet this is only one of the many surprising features of the
greatest light-weight car value in the world.
The new Studebaker LIGHT-SIX is manufactured complete in
the world s newest and most modern automobile plant— a plant
constructed especially for this car at a cost of 20,000,000 dollars.
It follows that the LIGHT-SIX must be a car of exceptional
quality, performance and reliability. And, because it is almost
entirely a manufactured car, parts-makers’ profits are virtually
eliminated.
Built out of the experience of sixty-eight years of earnest endeavor,
the new Studebaker LIGHT-SIX truly represents t .1 last word in
motor-car construction. It sets a new standard of achievement
in automobile engineering for refined and improved design,
scientific distribution and exact balance of car weight (2400
pounds evenly distributed over the entire chassis), quick
acceleration and power, smoothness and quietness of performance,
ease of operation and control, economy of petrol, tyres and
maintenance.
SEVEN FEATURES OF LIGHT-SIX SUPERIORITY
mm
24-Horsepower Engine.
3J x 4$ inch detachable-
head engine (79mm. x
114 mm.) ; cylinders and
crank-case cast integral;
generator, water pump,
oil pump, magneto' and
relay mounted in one
accessible and demountable
unit; horizontal feed car-
buretter with warm air
connection. To insure
smooth, quiet operation
and perfect balance of
reciprocating parts, crank-
shaft and connecting rods
«a machined all over.
SPi
H
Internal Hot Spot.
The Internal Hot Spot is
the result of combining
the intake manifold with
the motor head so that in-
let passages are directly
over each combustion
chamber at point where
head is not cooled by
water-jacket, and is very
hot. Manifold passages
are inclined slightly down-
ward and so arranged that
unvaporised petrol is car-
ried directly to heat areas
of intake walls, where com-
plete volatilisation occurs.
f
Inclined Valves.
Valves are inclined at a
20-degree angle, making
possible a freer passage of
gases to and from the
cylinder, reducing beat
losses and giving quicker
and better combustion and
entirely eliminating poc-
kets which store up dead
gases. By multiplying
action of the bell cranks,
a 5/16-inch lift of the
valves is obtained from
3/16-inch cams, thus insur-
ing quiet valve action.
d
Semi-Elliptic Springs.
Both front and rear
springs are semi-elliptic,
underslung in the rear.
Front springs are 38 x 2
inches with 7 leaves; rear
are 52 x 2 inches, with 7
leaves. Drive is of the
usual Hotchkiss type
through the rear springs
without troublesome torque
arms or radius rods. All
spring eyes are bronze’
bushed; rear springs are
provided with flanged
bushings, which are
machined to exact width
to eliminate side play and
reduce rattle and wear.
ďf
Cord Tyres.
The NEW LIGHT-SIX is
equipped with 32 x 4-inch
Cord Tyres both front and
rear, which means not
only welcome freedom
from tyre trouble, but,
even more important, bet-
ter roadability and higher
tyre, mileage. Incidentally,
Studebaker is the largest
user of Cord Tyres in the
world.
d
Upholstery.
The upholstery of the
NEW LIGHT-SIX is char-
acteristically Studebaker
in every respect. Seats are
wide and roomy and cov-
ered with French-plaited
genuine leather, built up
over long spiral springs,
heavily padded. Note the
wide-opening door, robe-
rail, and ample leg-room.
ď
Accessories.
Standard equipment in-
cludes rain-vision, slant-
ing windshield; built-in
thief-proof transmission
lock: electric horn, electri-
cally lighted mahogany-
finished instrument board,
on which are mounted
carburetter choke, light
and ignition switch with
lock, oil indicator, speed-
ometer driven fro'm propel-
ler shaft ammeter and
fuse box.
See this wonderful new Studebdker-—ride in it—and let us prove to you by any test you may suggest that
this is, indeed, the World’s Greatest Light-weight Automobile.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
It’s a pity the A.J.C. doesn’t keep a few
camels on tap. Then the Anniversary Day
meeting would have been worth seeing. In
the midst of the simoom at Itandwick the
caravans of the desert would have bowled
along as joyously as if on their native heath.
And what an innovation for the punter, who
might then have picked his fancy not by
points but by the hump, a thing he has a
much closer acquaintance with. Through
the clouds of dust and debris that were at
their thickest by 2 o’clock could be seen
a regular barometer of dressing—thinnest of
summer wear that told of an early-morning
start, then the jersey silk and taffetas that
had cast a cautious eye on the falling tem-
perature of half-past 11; and lastly the
few wise virgins who about 1 o’clock decided
to Jet good old tailor-made brave the blast.
The poor organd' muslins and what there
were of georgettes got a rough passage; but
for the most part Randwick looked as
though it had gone to the Summer sales and
bought a straight up-and-down striped Fuji
with a narrow belt, and let it go at that.
The chemise frock that the girl in the
suburbs is making from the pattern of her
best Magyar nightie was well to the fore —
‘‘so easy to make, my dear, and no fasten-
ings”—and in the cup of fury of Wednes-
day’s Randwick the wearers can be assured
the dress looked all they claim for it.
However, there were some real clothes
present, as, for instance, the cream tailored
skirt that was entirely composed of thick
white silk braid, and worn with a loose fit-
ting hip-length black-cloth coat. Two of
the prettiest girls—just flappers in organdi
—were chaperoned by Mrs. Floyd. One
was Margaret Ewan Fraser, just arrived
from England on a visit with her doctor
dad, and the other, her friend Nancy Free-
land. Margaret, though lacking the height,
is still very like her mother, and Nancy is
a pretty, tall, dark girl. Alison MacCor-
mick was there in navy, and the MacCor-
mick lady wore the usual black and white.
Mrs. Henry Ilill Osborne wrapped herself
to the chin in a soft fawn cloak, above
which was worn a nigger brown silk hat, and
below nigger brown footwear. Mrs. Sep
Levy, the embodiment of “Cherry Ripe,” led
the official stand dressing. Mrs. Fred Paine re-
presented the quietness of Melbourne in black.
Pretty Mrs. Vivers was all white softness
and flop hat. The Bertie Watson lady was
a bit of pink and black smartness, and
Una Clift defied the god of chance in jade
green.
Captain Saltmarshe, who came out here
with the Davidsons as A.D.C. but gave the
job up after a year and returned to England,
has just been appointed A.D.C. to the
Governor of Newfoundland, at the David-
sons’ old home.
Dorothy, only daughter of State ex-
Treasurer J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., has
engaged herself to Eric Rainbow, of Peter-
sham.- Eric, whose father was until his
death some months ago entomologist at
Sydney Museum, wears the Digger’s badge.
The drama and literature held most of
the seats the other afternoon at the mon-
ster round table at the Wentworth at which
Ola Jane Humphrey Broadwood had the
chair of honor. Mrs. Nelson, who hostessed
the tea-drinking, wore peacock green with
the skins of a few beavers hung about it,
and Mrs. Broadwood was clothed almost
entirely in marvellous Egyptian embroider-
ies wrought in gold and garnet on a ground-
work of black silkiness. The skirt was in
two layers, the under finishing off in tiny
harem fashion, or really more like the old-
time pantalettes. There was also a string
of pearls—sisters to the ones Cleo used to
lap up with her wine—some rings that made
the sunlight look pallid, beaten gold Egyptian
earrings, and a black satin cloak with gold
chrysanthemums blooming on it. Mrs.
Stewart Dawson sat next but one, and
Marian Marcus Clarke was opposite wear-
ing a high trig stock and one of the new
straight-brimmed sailor hats. The literary
Quinns were there, and a sonnet or two in
her handbag didn’t prevent Marjorie from
taking a healthy interest in the ices. Cap-
tain Nobbes’s pretty little wife sat beside
handsome Mrs. Townsend, and Marjorie
Bennett (the film-star’s sister) looked in
on the party between the jazzes.
Timothy Coghlan’s only daughter, Eden,
the small girl with the smooth black head
who danced through all the Jellicoe festi-
vities, has engaged herself in London to
John Nesbitt Dupont (and that sounds like
two Allies and a Highlander thrown into
one).
At half-past eight last Thursday night, in
all the rain, Betty Dalrymple Hay and her
three bridesmaids, sister Margaret, Heather
Linsley and Marjorie Milson, arrived at St.
James’s Church all in the one limousine,
looking like a storm-caught Flora and her
maidens. The three slim bridal assistants
grouped their pale blue and mauve and prim-
rose taffetas in the porch, and when they
were all set, Betty hopped up the steps on
her tall dad’s arm and was ready to be
handed over to Lieutenant Arthur Grigson,
of the Australian Flying Corps, son of
Doctor Grigson, of Macquarie-street. Lieu-
tenant Stewart Hay,' M.C., was best man,
and two more lieutenants, K. D. Hay and
Jack Gregory, were the groomsmen. Betty’s
dress was short and simple, the noteworthy
feature being a bit of old lace that 'draped
the skirt —that was some Point de Flanders
lent by the bridegroom’s mother. The cor-
rectness of the Queen’s Club enveloped the
wedding reception.
Mrs. .T. P. Franki has returned from a
visit to France on that saddest of all mis-
sions, looking for the grave of one’s dead.
Her husband kept his keen eyes on her
beloved rose-garden at Balmain when Mort’s
Dock could spare him.
A back room of the 1.0.0. F. temple be-
came a little corner of Sweden the other
night when singer Agnes Jansen, over from
Melbourne, exhorted her countrymen to send
exhibits of anything and everything to the
big _ Gothenburg Exhibition to be held in
1923. Many polite little speeches, always
preceded and followed by little quick bows,
and Mrs. Jansen received a basket of
flowers at least six feet high and a blue
and silver enamel brooch making her a mem-
ber of the N.S.W. branch of the Swedish
Society. There was much singing, apd
just as the evening was growing late the
famous Carmen of her day got home to her
own people. Sitting at the piano she played
and sang in a minor key something in Swe-
dish. The effect was electrical on the little
audience who sat tightly, seeing Heaven alone
knows what visions of far-away home towns.
Is there any old inhabitant who didn’t
hear Emma Wangenheim between 1879 and
1890? She was the operatic prima donna
of her day, and was under-studied by no
less a person that
Nellie S t ewart
Emma’s dad ran the
old Cafe de Paris in
King-street, where
Albert’s music-shop
now stands, in its
day the swank eat-
ing-house of Sydney.
Its marble-topped
tables often bore
striking caricatures
of celebrities drawn
by Proprietor Gus,
who, before he de-
veloped the habit of
acquiring hotels, was
a black-and-white
ar t i st. In those
days the cafe shel-
tered all the artistic
talent. Madame Christian, then Sydney’s
leading songbird, the enchanting singer Mrs.
Palmer, and Carlyle Smythe’s dad, “the
much-travelled,” were a few of those who
called on Gus for bed and board. In that
long ago, the little Emma, always a musi-
cian, used to play Madame Christian’s
accompaniments. Her earliest musical
knowledge was gained under Madame Bush-
elle, sister of Vincent Wallace, of Maritana
fame, and later, in Italy; the elder Garcia
and Lamberti developed the voice that be-
came the magnet of Kelly and Leon’s opera
house at the corner of York and King streets,
where McArthur’s warehouse now stands.
Later on. ijnder the management of her
second husband, .T. A. Carroll, son of a
deputy-governor of Darlinghurst Gaol, Emma
pioneered opera into the small towns with
D. Flohm as musical conductor and the ill-
fated Jules Simonsen, uncle to the famous
Francie Alda, as tenor. Among Emma’s
later good deeds was the discovery of Marie
Narelle.
Last week Fanny Du rack became Mrs.
Bernard Gately. Bernard is interested in
racing—turf, not aquatic.
Lucy Windeyer's wedding dress deserves
a par. all to itself. It is of white satin
shaded in diaphanous pink, the whole cov-
ered with the most exquisite old lace, and
the tint acquired by the combination is soft-
est apricot. To go with this is a train quite
three yards long, and a veil that seems spun
of foam. It. is a Russian weave, and the
particular blend has not been made for over
300 years. The Winde.yer family is famous
for its collection of lace, and cousin Mrs.
Gordon Wesche shares the honors with them.
Last Thursday Sister Minnie Chapman,
daughter of Rev. A. Chapman, of Mosman
and formerly of Brisbane, made matrimonial
promises at Mrs. J. Stitt's house to Lt. Boy
Wilkinson, only son of Mr-, and Mrs. J. Wil-
kinson, Albion. The bride, who was one of
our finest war nurses, was given away by
brother Peter, late captain of the Seaforth
Highlanders. Maisie Wilkinson was brides-
maid, and Captain Frank Phillips was best
man.
The Matrons’ Ball, at Moss Yale on Fri-
day night, netted its annual glittering catch
—big fish and little fish, but all with silver
scales. The decorations of the hall had been
keyed into a nasturtium symphony by artist
De Mestre. The wonderful flowers, with
their reds and golds and browns, flaunted
gaily everywhere. Around the pillars were
arranged tubs out of which grew orange-
trees surrounded with nasturtiums, and the
whole thing formed a scherzo of happiness
that won applause for tone-color Roy. Mrs.
Frank McDonald looked well-thought-out
in rose-pink; and Mrs. Rodney Hangar made
her blue taffeta impressive with good lace
and pearls; Joan Rolin went to the party
in emerald green, and Ethel Campbell saved
her pink taffeta frock by not sitting out
once. Barbara Westmacott, in a green
bodice and gold skirt, propped up her part-
ner’s head with her fan, which she carried
at an oblique angle; and Muffle Layton’s
ankle wasn’t ashamed whoever saw it.
Winifred Watson, in pink and grey, was
like a little China girl out of a cabinet, and
Mrs. Watson Holdship contrived to look
as though she had never heard that the Syd-
ney Hospital had an auxiliary. There was
the usual crowd of men and girls; the whole
Fuller family; Mrs. Throsby, of Throsby
Park, in soft black satin; and Mrs. Tony
Hordern, looking terrifically expensive in a
crop of black ostrich feathers. Innumerable
small children were brought by mother to
hear the jazz band from Sydney; and when
the bandsmen gave the long drawn-out wail
in the middle of the first number, the scan-
dalised oldest inhabitant protested against
bringing “even the babies of the family to
a grown-up dance, even if they were housed
in the dressing-rooms.”
Little Colleen Cohen, one of Sydney’s
cleverest musicians, owns a fine diamond
engagement-ring. She secured it a week or
so ago from Dr. Rich, of Darling i'oint,
He is one of the clever Riches who know so
much about all the arts, and he met Colleen
just four months ago. Her dad is solicitor
Keith Cohen, and her uncle is the Judge, so
she’s no stranger. Address for congratula-
tions, the Savoy, Darlinghurst.
Marian Marcus Clarke is very elated over
having bought up the world’s film rights in
dad’s “For the Term of His Natural.” Under
the mother’s will Marian and her sister in-
herited the family interest in the novel and
the drama, but the film rights became the
property of picture-man George Smith. How-
ever, when death overtook George, Marian
saw her chance, and silently set about
acquiring the World’s film rights for her very
own self.
Mrs. Arthur Scrivener, who returned to
Sydney by the Naldera last week from
India, where she had been visiting her elder
son, Captain Herbert Scrivener, brought
news of his engagement to Dorothy Jeans,
daughter of Mr. J. A. Jeans of Dorset
(Eng.). After losing a leg at the war
Captain Scrivener got an Indian appoint-
ment as a Government House A.D.C., and
then his present job of Assistant Comptroller
of Grass Farms at Peshawar.
Married quietly last week, the popular
Topsie Kelynack, who made Robert Fitz
Evans (the Fitz is a front name with all
the Evans family) the happiest man in two
States. The Fitz Evans family are among
our largest landowners, and Robert’s littld
bit, Merriwa, on the border, cuts a chunk
out of both Queensland and New South
Wales. _ Topsie, who has been living up the
river since barrister dad’s health grew so
uncertain, made the usual promises at St.
Stephen's, and wore a beautiful cream tailor-
made that tucked under its coat a ducky
cream silk jumper, and a smart cream hat
for the occasion. A strictly family party
gathered after the ceremony at the John
Atkinsons’ house in Rockwell-crescent, just
a stone’s throw from the Arthur Kelynacks’
old home, where Commodore Dumaresq is
camped for the present.
Dunsany, the literary baron, arrested in
Ireland the other day for having ammuni-
tion in his lordly possession, is linked with
us in that he married the youngest daughter
of Lord Jersey—Lady Beatrice, who was
about 10 years old when dad was Governor
of N.S.W. He was a lieutenant in the Cold-
stream Guards, then captain in the Royal
Inniskilling Fusiliers, and was wounded on
the anniversary of the Gallipoli landing in
1016. One of his most powerful plays, “A
Night at an Inn,” gave the audience the
creeps at the actors’ corroboree at Sydney
Criterion in 1918.
Florence Watson, only daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. F. R. Watson, now of Manly and
recently of Katoomba, was picturesquely
married to Mr. L. G. Christie, of Roseville,
at St. Matthew’s Church, Manly, last week.
The bride was known in Katoomba as the
girl with the perfect complexion, and was a
prime favorite. The service was choral and
the bride struck a novel note by havin'*- her
gorgeous dress trainless. After the “I wills”
a reception was held at Dungowan. Ocean
Beach. Honeymoon at Kosciusko.
If only Olive Kelso King had been an
actress on the wane the Serbian campaign
would have ensured her star parts till she
was wrapped in her winding sheet. Yet
another banquet and illuminated address
have been flung at her, this time by the
Serbs in Sydney, the cloth being spread at
Adams’s Hotel. Dad and stepmother Kelso
King supported Olive, who, thank goodness
did not appear in her sergeant-major’s uni-
form. Surely Serbia must be the home of
the spotlight. Joffre, French and Birdwood
have slipped almost to oblivion, but the
Serbian heroines continue to be dogged with
festive meats and columns in the papers.
When Charlie Bean went off to write Aus-
tralian history in the solitude of Quean-
beyan, he little gtiessed that Dan Cupid had
paired him off with the very young acting-
matron of the
Queanbeyan Hospi-
tal. But there you
are—a man thinks
he is setting out to
make a history and
finds himself think-
ing of making a
home. So Ethel
Clara Young, re-
named for domestic
purposes “Effie,”
became Mrs. Charlie
Bea n, the most-
envied bride of last
week. Charlie’s
best girl for life is
the daughter of
Police - Sergeant
Young, well known
in his day in Wagga,
Narrandera and Tumbanunba as a crack
all-round cricketer. She got her training at
the Goulburn District Hospital, and nearly
died through nursing influenza patients in
the ’l9 epidemic. St. Andrew’s saw the
strictly family wedding, Dean Talbot boomed
out the blessin'g, and Doctor Jack Bean was
best man. The bride was all in white, but
dispensed with the all-over tulle cascade,
and wore a veil thht fell a tiny rivulet of
tulle down her back —something like the
Court debs, of Victoria’s day or the ladies
of Josephine’s set. Charlie’s four-year-old
niece and godchild, Barbara, looking like a
high-class French doll, and little Mabel
Young, a pink rosebud, helped Charlie and
his bride do the deed. The address, after
the honeymoon, is the homestead on Cun-
ningham’s estate at Queanbeyan. The new
Mrs. Bean is herewith photoed by Harris.
Violet, the tall fair daughter of the
McKays, of Annambah, Maitland, and of
Bedleaf, Double Bay, is going to take pos-
session of one-half of the Walker twins
(Monty) for -pkeeps. Violet’s other sister.
Emily, became Mrs. Turnbull, of Melbourne.
A _ Sydney girl in New York declares the
fashions are just as ridiculous as Vogue.
“If you hold your cape around you close
to your little Mary,” she says “you will have
the most fashionable wrap and angle of wear-
ing it. All the girls and women at the foot of
the skyscrapers look as if they are about to
appear on the stage, very much made up,
very short skirts and silly shoes. They wear
their hats straight on, with the hair mar-
celled and standing out all round.” And
here’s a picture of the famous Board Walk
of Atlantic City. “It is eight miles long and
60ft. wide and has huge hotels jutting on to
it, not counting hundreds of smart little
stores —and all this over the beach. There
are four huge piers jutting seaward, and one
is called the Million Dollar Pier so that the
stranger may not imagine it cost tuppence-
a’penny.”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our new Gov. is a patron of the Arts. The other
day he sought out Herbert Jervis, assistant Govt.
Ethnologist in his workaday hours and a fine
water-colorist any old time, and paid good cash for
three little gum-tree sketches.
Wednesday saw a large and cheery mob at Ascot,
for the Foundation Day meeting. His Ex. came
along- with CoL Parsons and Capt. Lukin as body-
guard, and as far as" possible shunned the vice-regal
pen. Mrs. Mayoress Maxwell wore navy georgette, and
Mrs. Theodore looked smart in a brown silk jersey
frock. Mrs. J. Fihelly wore mole crepe de Chine,
Mrs. G. H. Irving was in white, topped with a
stunning black hat, and Mrs. Lachlan Wilson smiled
happily above sand georgette, embroidered in navy.
Ivy Tritton, daughter of the Clayfield Trittons, has
a diamond ring which was purchased by Roy Shaw,
late lieut. of the 14th F.C. Engineers. He is the
youngest son of the late G. S. Shaw, of Rockhampton,
and Mrs. Shaw, of Ashley, Clifton Gardens.
The recent big social event was the wedding of
Major Tom Maeleod, C. de G. (with palm) and
0.8. E., to Ruby Shannon, youngest daughter of
John Shannon, of Wyalla, Toowoomba, and of Salt-
bush Park, Mackay. The wedding was in Too-
woomba, and the Sydney mail on Wednesday morn-
ing was packed with Brisbane guests. Canon
Oakeley tied the knot, and John Shannon gave Ids
daughter away.

They get shaken and tossed

perfectly safe to send them in this

For the British-made Onoto
cannot leak. When you close it,
with a turn of the finger and
thumb, it becomes a sealed tube.
Not a drop of ink can possibly
escape.
When you open it again, you find
the finger - hold dry, though the

The Camel: Yarn walks too heavily and
lacks point.... A.P.N.: No hope while you muddle
your ideas in that way.... Alice M.: A thin little
picture of a scene painted in the same phrases that
have done duty a million times before has no
chance. ... A.L.L.: Nothing there.... J.A.H.: Stagger
and bump verse that gets to nothing. ... P.A.N.:
Very dull stuff... .John H.: “The Riders” is chiefly
distinguished by bad rhymes, bad grammar and
absence of meaning... .A.T.lt.: Not up.... Alf J.:
It doesn’t strike us. .. .F.A.D.: Try to find some-
thing to write about... .Mary T.: Compare Shaks-
peare’s sonnets with Wordsworth’s “Westminster
Bridge” and you get the difference; but the sketch
may have three rhymes.... Leery: Far too many
words to say that small thing... .V.V.: Very bad
verse. . . .P.A.S.: Take it away and burn it. In a
well-regulated community the job would be left to
the hangman. .. .A.J.L.: Here’s one of the gems: —
Silk-stockinged maiden fair, what art
Of giddy Terpsichore,
If, perchance, art queried to impart
Thy ankle’s knowledge dost employ ?
I wonder more and more.
My eyes held captive by the toy.
Wherefore fain would I ask the hour,
Oh, goddess! Through my vest
Contains a watch. Maud Allan’s power
Is sure outrivalled —wondrous feat!
1 stand and watch with zest
Thy mad gyrations in the street.
~ . . J.S.S.: Not up.... Beryl: Doesn’t get anywhere
near.... Frank R.: A sonnet has got to be a long
way better than that....A.S. (Petersham): The yarn
is about nothing that matters to man or beast....
Energy: Futile mass of words. If the thing is
dead, what’s the use of killing it some more?....
Calix: Cairo sketch too slight L.L. (Parramatta):
Verse staggers all over the place. ... J.A.A.: It has
a flat-footed movement ending in violent bumps.
....Peter S.: Worse sonnets have been written—
also better.... .C.H.H.: “Charles” is a dull sort of
person, and what happened to him when drunk is
of very little interest. .. .F.M.C.: “Socialistic
Sausages” a bit too crude.. . .8.A.L.: Nothing in
it....A.F. (North Sydney): It isn’t verse; it isn’t
prose; it doesn’t mean anything... .0.C.T.: “Furnace
Number Three” wanted better telling... .J.M.A.:
Not for us. . . .Florence L. : Poor little thing without
point or interest... .J.J. (New Farm): Don’t like

right at the start!... .Arthur N.: Too many bumps.

bad a doing in Australia as the skylark in England.
Give the emu or the buff Orpington a turn....

us 11.G.C.: Not up....8.C. (Milson’s Point):
Not well enough t01d... .S.H.G.: “Soul of a Violin”
fails badly.... Ted R.: No, you “don’t know much
about poetry,” as you say. .. .E.M.E.: Not enough in
“Sylvan Lament”... .W.F. (Elsternwick) : “Open
Road” fails. .. .W.M.C.: Too slight. .. .Bellerive:
The “Last Game” wins:—•
I’ll quit for ever—
You treacherous men.
Never more will I enter
Your evil den.
Mv master’s trust I
Did boldly defame.
Adieu to the table—
I’ve played my last game.
At dawn in he’s room
The gamester lay dead.
Pistol in hand and a
Bullet wound in he’s head.
Inscribed on a note was —
He’s ruination and shame,
With death before prison.
I’ve played my last gam6.
.... Kepa: Being dead, let it rest.... Darby: Too
attenuated. .. .Mamie: Subject has been torn to shreds.
.... Six-and-Eight: More compression needed.... Ole
Kell: Ole warn. . . .Skyrider: Shooting yarn too
wordy... .11C: Just misses... .Annie Philaxis:
Writing on both sides of paper rules it out.... Alex:
Space outruns interest... .Top: Wish you would
use more paper and fewer words... .Cuss: Every sub-
editor has a special ftxe for the miscreant who vamps
pars from the dailies. .. .C.C.: Your “Blank and
Blanky” article fails at its very base. The “Great
Australian adjective” is used, and commonly, by
members of “the best London clubs,” and it has
been the favorite curse for generations at both
Eton and Oxford... .Spider: Ford story 01d.... Mary
P.: Yarns told, with variations, many times before.
D.D.: Old.

“Thirty-one”: Spent 10 days’ leave in
1917 with Johnny. Johnny was a Yank
who had worked his passage to Australia
and enlisted in the infantry. “My country
is too proud to fight,” he explained, “but
I ain’t.” We had had a great evening to-
gether. Johnny knew where good beer could
be got at any hour, and about 2 a.m. he
took me to a Chow joint in Regent-street.
When the food arrived the waiter (a Dago
of sorts) gave me a pair of carved ivory
chop-sticks to eat with. I didn’t want the
tucker, but I did crave those chop-sticks.
So when the bill came I told Johnny to pay.
He put in a fiver at the desk, and the boss
Chow placed it carefully on the ledge and
counted out the change. That was when
I dived out of the door, but the Chow'
glimpsed the chop-sticks and left Johnny,
the fiver and the change to go in pursuit.
He could run, too, and I was only a hundred
yards in front at Liberty’s corner, where I
turned and ran bang into a big policeman.
“I’ve pinched a pair of chop-sticks off a
Chow,” I said as he grabbed me. “Go on,
get,” replied Robert. My lead was only
25 yards now, but when the Chow came
round the turn J. Hop gathered him in
and kept him arguing until I was out of
sight. I often wonder what Li Hung Chang
said when he got back to his restaurant and
found that Johnny, the fiver and the change
had-chased him out of the joint. He must
have been as wild as I was when some dirty
thief pinched the chop-sticks in Horseferry-
road.

GREEN hill, round, and sunlit,
ZJ Above the ships and town;
y M From realms of radiant spaces,
Slow breezes singing down
To stir the earth-warmed grasses
And touch a girl’s soft gown.
The Chief came round at midnight:
"We’ll burn the oil and coals
And raise South Head ere Morning
Her ruddy light unrolls.”
Through engine-room and stokehold
The word half-muttered flew,
It spurred men in the bunkers,
And loud the forced draught blew,
To leave two trails behind us,
Brown smoke and snowy foam.
Oh. proud beneath night’s glory
The good screws drove us home!
Sharply the shovels rattled
By brawny muscles swung.
The songs the engines shouted
Were as high anthems sung;
Chained harmonies that quivered
Until they broke their bars
And rose in music splendid
Brave-throated to the stars.
Slow notes were there and gay ones,
That touched the heart and cheered
As through the night’s vast spaces
For Sydney port we steered.
Oh, rovers’ hearts are happy
When they are outward bound —
Nor’-east away from Brisbane
Sou’-westward from the Sound!
Roll northward out of Auckland,
You restless mothers’ sons!
Yet there’s a trail awaiting—
Unseen its pathway runs
Through ocean’s lonely places,
Beneath a rimless dome,
And when the helmsmen find it
The trail will lead them home.
At eight bells of the morning
The watch below came on.
They guessed without the telling
Just why the spun steel shone.
Because the crossheads twinkled
And every dam’ thing danced.
They knew ere lights of morning
Across the waters glanced,
The bluff, black Heads of Sydney
Would mark the ocean’s bounds.
The new watch were not sluggards—
The steam crept up two pounds.
It was a greaser’s singing
That stirred a* tired man’s dreams
And bore him to a hilltop
Where golden sunlight streams;
A crest that in his roaming
Was always far away,
Yet one that he remembered
Because of eyes of grey.
Grey eyes, grey years, grey waters!
The flood of dreaming came
Until one stood beside him,
Grey-eyed and spoke his name.
The Chief spoke in the dawning:
“The ruddy day is come.
Ye’ve walked her home, ye loafers,
Ye’ve made her vitals hum.”
On his hard lips was fashioned
A smile like a grimace;
Through engifie-room and stokehold,
It spread to every face.
Amid the heat and thunder,
’Twas like a silent cheer,
Because the port of Sydney,
Our own home port, was here.
Oh, grey eyes may be gentle
And grey eyes can be hard,
But her eyes for her sailor
With lovely lights were starred,
As though he’d chanced on Heaven
And found the doors unbarred.
MAOBILAND.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Captain William Dampier,
R.N., was on his voyage to New
Holland in the last year of the
17th century—that curious voyage in which
he meant to do so much and achieved so
little —lie wrote, as in duty bound, from each
port of call to my Lord of the Admiralty.
One of his letters was dated from “In
Bahia harbor on ye Coast of Brasile,” April
22, 1699. It gives his point of view about
his first lieutenant, and it is strange that
the writer of the very truthful “Journals”
could have been such a liar. At least, that
is what a number of his brother post-captains
in the Navy subsequently considered him to
be. Abridged, it ran this way :
And j'ett all these happy circumstances, were not
sufficient to our ease and quiet, while I was daily
plagued by the insolence of my Lieut. Georg Fisher.
At my first coming aboard I was importuned by
Lieut. Fisher to enter two little boys as officers’
servants. On refusing this request (it being against
their Lordships’ orders) he ceased not to importune
me, and began to quarrell with my Purser. At the
Canary Islands he began to be more Boisterous, and
asked me why I suffered none to go into the Pin-
nace. I told him that I had commanded otherwise
for fear of shaking her too much. Then he shaked
his Fist att me, Grind in my Face, and told me
that he cared not for me. However, on
being threatened with confinement, he apologised in
my cabbin and promised not to be guilty of the like
for the future.
Coining from St. Jago I heard him complain-
ing in Publick of the badness of the Bread, and that
itt was not fitt for men to Eate. On viewing the
bread I could not find one Bitt not fitt to Eate,
att which he seemed much Displeased and Muttered
his mind to some of his Accomplices. On ye 9th
March Last, he sat in the Steeridge and there
Exprest his grievance about the Beer.... and like-
wise said that it was not Lawfull to let them
[the hands] drink it within seven inches of the
Bottom, I could not imagine that he designed
less than to set up for a Patriott amongst my men
Soon afterwards, when I had occasion to speak
to him about the broaching of a casque of beer
he grind at me after his usuall Manner and I thought
he would Collar me. But his frequent affronts
had so baffled my Patience, that I prevented
him bv striking him with my Cane, which I
had then in my hands, att which he turned to me
called me Old Dog, Old Villain, and told my men
“Gents, take care of that Old Pyrating Dog, for he
designs to Run away with you and the’ King’s
ship.” I confined him to his cabin, and called
all hands aft to Encourage them to Obedience but
while I spoke he interrupted me by Preaching his
own Doctrine loading me with 'all the Crimes
that could incense my men Against me as Piracy
and Murder. He continued railing at me Severall
hours together, and behaved so outrageously that
on the 16 I was -forced to put him in Irons lest
he should cause my men to mutiny. After I
anchored here [in Bahia Bay] his Curses and scur-
rilous Language continued daily, although he was
a prisoner; so that I was obliged either to return
home or get ridd of him. I went to the Governor,
who had heard of my Misfortune (which any body
could tell him of that had once been aboard here,
such unusuall noise the Lt. made) and he prevented
my Request by proffering to secure my Lt. ashore*
So on ye 28th I sent him ashoare when he was put
in prison until this fleet savles for Lisbon. At
Lisbon, Mr. Fisher will be delivered to Mr. (Paul)
Methuen, his Majesty’s Envoy, to whom I writt
to send him home. I have sent ashoare four months
provision for Mr. Eisher and his servant, because
the Portugese are loth to part with. any provision.
Mr Fisher is no quieter in prison than he was
aboard. He has tried to incense some Dutch Mer-
chants against me, telling them I was a pirate,
had taken a Dutch ship, tyd the men back to back
and hove them overboard.
One would like to make a long footnote
about the incident that is probably referred
to here, but there is not room. Mr. Fisher
exaggerated a little. Quite naturally.
Since then he has been working on the Priests and
Friars, and the Ghostly Padres have given him a
writ against me. The Governor of Bahia has asked
me where we are bound, so told him I was bound to
Benculi on the Island Sumatra. I send with this my
officers’ evidence against Fisher, only my purser’s
and chirurgeon’s I have not sent because the Lieuten-
ant and they were at difference, and they might be
partially * * *
The Bay of All the Saints (Bahia de
Todos los Santos) might more appropriately,
in summer-time, at any rate —and there was
not much difference in the winter—have been
called the Bay of All the Devils. It was
so hot, humid and unpleasant in its climate
that, whilst the Roebuck lay at anchor on
its broad bosom, her crew were unanimously
of opinion that they breathed something at
least of the atmosphere of Hell.
In the opinion of her commander, the
climate was suitable, indeed, to that malig-
nant devil, his First Lieutenant. The I irst
Lieutenant’s idea of it was that his inhuman
devil of a captain had raised the heat from
his own domain in order to torture him into
death or insanity. It certainly is very won-
derful that George Fisher did not go per-
manently mad.
Captain Dampier walked the poop—back
and forward along the rail above the
quarter-deck, from ladder to ladder —with
what was a very black and discontented
look in his usually gentle, philosophic face.
He was in his shirt-sleeves and carried !:us
telescope in one hand. Every now and then
he focussed it upon the landing quay out
across the gleaming waters, as though he ex-
pected a boat to put off towards the ship.
The white houses of the town, their line
broken by clumps of dark green foliage, were
dazzling in the sunlight. Overhead the hot
skv was blue enamel. No breath of air
moved across the bay, and the flag of St.
George drooped above the big lantern on the
high stern rail of the little ship, draping it
in white and red.
From beneath the deck which Cap-
tain Dampier moved restlessly to and fro
there came an intermittent uproar of com-
plaint. Sometimes it broke out in hoarse
be!lowings of blasphemy and obscenity ; some-
times deep meanings, that came through the
planking as a murmuring rumble, varied the
bellowings. Occasionally would come a
silence that never lasted long. Mr. Fisher
was in confinement in irons in his cabin, and
Mr. Fisher did not take kindly to his duress.
For’ard, under the break of the forecastle,
a number of the crew lolled on the deck in
shadow that shifted as the ship swung with
the tide, and between some of the guns the
men had rigged multi-colored rugs as awn-
ings, and gasped and sweated beneath them
—a few smoking clay pipes, some sucking
limes and oranges, two or three asleep, a
group of four who played cards listlessly.
The heat was intolerable.'
“Pass the word for the bos’n, some of you,”
called Captain Dampier down into the waist.
“Mister Corbin! Mis-ter Corbin!” was
bawled about the ship, and down the open
hatch into the ’tween decks..
At the sound of the Captain’s voice the
First Lieutenant’s outcries renewed them-
selves.
“Ye bloody-minded villain!” he roared.
“Would ye stew a man to death in this
stinkin’ hole? Rot ye—ye’ve th’ bowels of a
griffin! Pirate, Thief! MURDERER!
Let me put of this, ye devil of Hell. Ah-h,
God have pity on me!”
I-lis shouting died away in sobbing groans,
and for a little while there was peace
throughout the ship. Dampier stood at the
head of the larboard poop-ladder, awaiting
vhe coming of the boatswain.
Presently the round red face of that trucu-
lent mariner of East Kent appeared above
the combings of the hatch. He blinked at
the sunlight, as though he had been asleep.
“Dick!” cried Dampier when he saw him
—“come up here. I’ve a word for to say to
ye.”
“Ye fat rascal!” howled Mr. Fisher, as
the boatswain waddled aft. The First Lieu-
tenant’s dark and wrathful face was pressed
against the little square window- of his cabiu
that looked out upon the quarter-deck. He
spat at Mr. Corbin as that worthy ap-
proached. “Ye barrel of bad ale! For
th’ love o’ God, send me in some water,
bos’n,” he w-himpered pitifully.
Mr. Corbin took no notice of him, but
hauled his broad bulk up the sloping ladder,
and stood beside the captain.
“Ay, ay, sir. Ye’re wishful for to see
me, Cap’n Dampier?”
“Bos’n,” said Dampier, “hark at that
fellow!”
Mr. Fisher had broken out again, and was
howling like a dog.
seen men — men, I said, sir, not
officers —I’ve seen ’em quieted down wi’ a
w-ooden gag. Cap’n. Mighty useful them
little gags be—for to stop such a hulla-
baloo as that.”
“Oh, a gag. Yes, useful enough at times,
Dick—but he’s a pestilent fellow. I’ve been
a-thinking of more than that, bos’n. We
must get rid of the rascal. There’ll never be
any peace in the ship else. We must be rid
of him for good.”
Mr. Corbin walked to the starboard side,
spat into the glassy water, and looked out to
sea for a few moments. With folded arms he
came back to Dampier, and stared at him
solemnly.
“Well?”

WHY ZAM-BUK IS
* UNEQUALLED.
Totally different in character from other oint-
ments, Zam-Buk is immeasurably superior to
them in having a threefold action on the
skin. First it allays pain and irritation;
secondly it kills harmful germs, and thus
removes all danger of a cut or sore
taking “bad ways”; and lastly, when the
bad place has thus been purified, it
grows a fresh layer of perfectly new
skin.
Because of its unique healing value,
1 Zam-Buk should always be kept
handy in the home, workshop,
and on the cattle station, sheep
run, or farm up country; it
may be necessary to apply
some at any moment, and the
balm is so pure and whole-
some that it can be used
with perfect safety on the most
delicate skin, whether bruised,
broken or diseased. A pot of
Zam-Buk ready for instant use
will save many hours of pain
and anxiety, as well as pounds
in doctors’ bills. A cure by
Zam-Buk can always be regarded
as permanent and lasting. Don’t
delay, but obtain a pot of Zam-Buk
at once, and always keep it handy.
Zam-Buk is not a mere ointment. It
is “something quite different. It is a
superior healing balm, a necessity to
humanity, and the quickest allayer of the
ills that afflict the human skin.
Zam-Buk is invaluable for Cuts, Burns, Bruises, Pimples,
Blackheads, Scalds, Scalp Troubles, Piles, Poisoned Wounds,
Festering Eruptions, Boils, Psoriasis, Eczema, Abscesses, Face
Blotches, Eruptions, Rheumatism, Stiffness, Bad Legs, Ulcers, Ring-
worm, Barber’s Rash, Blisters, and injured and unhealthy conditions
of the skin. From all Chemists and Stores, 1/6 and 3/6: or post free from

“Well, sir, by y’r leave, there be a main
o’ stone ballast i’ th’ ship’s hold. Two sacks
sewed together over head and feet, and a
few bits o’ rock —’tis six fathom deep where
we’re a-lyin’ here, Cap’n. After dark, now
.■* —an’ who’s the wiser?”
Dampier started, and looked at his petty
officer. Momentarily, a queer gleam of
savageness came into the brown eyes—but
was gone in the instant.
“No, no,” he said. “’Tis a King’s ship,
Dick Corbin. ’Twas different when we was
with Captain Sawkins by Panama. How
long d’ye think this fellow would ha’ lasted
in the Spanish Main —in those brave days?
Pst!” he snapped his fingers—“not that
long! But now ’tis different. I’m re-
sponsible to my Lords o’ the Admiralty, now,
Dick —not to the Devil.”
“Ay, Cap’n, an’ Master Fisher he don’t
forget it. How many tunes ha’ we heard
him prate o’ courts-martial? A round dozen,
at the least. ’Tis a pity we was not bucca-
neers again for a day and a night. I doubt
me if ye’d maroon him, even now, Cap’n?
An’ yet, there’s islets off this coast —a-plenty.
What was you thinkin’ of, then—might I
make bold for to ask, sir?”
Mr. Dampier paced up the sloping deck to
the stern rail, and back again, before he an-
swered.
“I was thinking, Dick, that we might
leave him here. v To that end I’ve writ a
letter to the Governor of Bahia, Don Manoel
da Silva., begging accommodation in his
calabosa for this rascal, until he can get ship
to Europe. Mr. Biddlecombe hath ta’en it
ashore, and will bring the Governor’s reply.
T>— n him, he should be back by this. ’Tis
nigh five hours since he went away.”
Mr. Corbin looked towards the town.
“Boat a-comin’ off now, sir—mebbe ’tis th’
purser. Will ye not take a look through th’
perspective glass, will—l do baag y’r honor’s
humble pardon, I mean Cap’n Dampier’s,
sir ?”
Dampier levelled his telescope towards the
landing-place. “Yes,” he said. “ ’tis the
pinnace. With the blessing of God, we’ll be
rid of the fellow soon. Dick”—he lowered
the glass and spoke earnestly, and in a low
tone, a kind of beseeching expression in his
face—“ Dick, ye’ll stand by me in this busi-
ness. We was good shipmates and comrades
when we crossed Panama after a-Davinsr
Bartholmew Sharp—ye’ll remember how I
saved ye from the alligator in the swamp, old
Dickon? ’Tis likely, if this fellow reaches
England—which God forbid ! —and we re-
turn safe from New Holland, that he’ll make
some trouble for me. He’s a proper Navy
officer —not like us, who are but new to its
ways—and he knows well how to set about
a-getting up one o’ these pestilent courts-
martial. Please God he may die of a fever
in the calabosa here. Indeed, that the
plague may carry him off in this stews of
a place is my great 'hope. But if the
worst should hap, and we find him await-
ing us with his court-martial when we
roturn to England, I can count on you, old
Dick?”
Tears positively welled in the boatswain’s
blue eyes as he held out a horny and tarry
hand to his comrade of the old pirating days-.
“Bjl God’s bones, to the last word, Cap’n!”
Presently the pinnace reached the ship,
and a cadaverous and sallow gentleman
climbed up the side, bowed with great cere-
mony to Captain Dampier from the quarter-
deck, and, mounting the ladder, handed him a
letter on the poop. Mr. Biddlecombe was
nothing if not ceremonious,
“Well, then, Mr. Biddlecombe, what saith
Don Manoel?”
“ ’Tis all writ down, sir; but as ’tis in
Portugee ’tis not possible for Christian men
to comprehend it. But he says that he will
receive Mr. Fisher, provided that you send
provisions for his sustenance, and will
despatch him to Lisbon, by the first ship, to
the charge of King William’s Envoy there.”
“fhv <r o od r We will ho wpII ,-id nf
fellow.’ Com'e down, bos’n, and we will in-
form him as much. Damme, I’ve a weight
oft my mind. Mr. Biddlecombe, do you see
to his effects, as well as to the provision the
Governor demands. Let the pinnace lie
astarn. He shall go ashore this afternoon!
The sooner the better—God knows ! Come
bos’n. AVe will see the fellow.”
Str«irur»lv or,u nnnnfr ,-„n* • , ~
Fisl u ha i hee for in v, M ?‘
. sner naa been tor some time. His howl-
mgs and cursings had not disturbed the
peace for half an hour. When Dampier and
the boatswain stood outside the barred door
°f his cabin, there was no sound from within,
“The dog cannot have escaped?” muttered
Dampier, a little anxiously. “Open the door,
Dick. Something must he amiss.”
As indeed there was.
The stench that wafted out of the tinv
low-ceiled, foetid cabin was such as to make
Dampier fall back a pace when the door
was opened. He drew a handkerchief hastilv
from his breeches pocket and held it to his
nose.
Stretched out across the deck, face up-
ward, hiy the unfortunate First Lieutenant
— "is mouth gaping with cracked lips and
a dry and swollen tongue protruding from
between them. Beside him stood his empty
water-ewer and an earthenware mug. He
was manacled both by wrists and ankles—
the Cruel bilboes of the time. The place
bad not been cleaned out for many days. It
was little wonder that the sufferings of Mr.
Eisher had at last been silenced by a bout
of unconsciousness. It was a merciful thing
that this relief had come to alleviate his
misery.
. But there was not much pity in Dam-
picCs usually kindly countenance.
.“Drag the out, Dick, and sloosh him
with sea-water. He has but swooned. Then
fetch the ehirurgeon. Tell him to let a little
blood, and to give him some wine. ’Tis all
he needs. By God”—he laughed cruelly-
“this will teach him ’tis unwise to name me
‘old pirate’ and ‘old dog’ ! But I’ll wager
he’ll wish he were back in his cabin aboard
the Roebuck when the plague gets him in
the calabosa of Bahia.”
• • • . .
Two years later, all but a month, her
Majesty’s unworthy ship Roebuck sank at
her moorines at the island of Ascension
whilst on her homeward voyage, and Mr.
Dampier took passage thence for England
in. the Canterbury, East Indiaman. Queen
Anne was rid of a bad bargain. ...
Many things had happened in that two
years. For one thing, Captain Dampier
had discovered to his dissatisfaction —and
the great libelling of this island —that Aus-
tralia was “a barbarous, useless, inhospit-
able and utterly worthless country, peopled
by an uncanny race, the members of which
were a kind of cross between monkeys and
demons.” And, for another, Lieutenant
George Fisher had finally got himself home
to England, and had there moved Heaven,
earth and the Lords of the Admiralty to
bring his late commanding officer to a
court-martial when he should have returned
from his voyage. You may picture that
sallow and bitter gentleman sitting up at
night—in mean lodgings * in Portsmouth qr
in his cabin at sea —to hate Will Dampier.
It is quite certain that by the time the trial
came off Mr. Fisher had his evidence by
heart. There was no point in it that he
did not know the just value of. There
were no possible reply on Captain Dam-
pier’s part which he was not prepared to
counter with enthusiasm. The gallant officer
had but one aim in life, one hobby, one
earnest pre-occupation—the undoing of the
late commander of the Roebuck.
And so we come to the court-martial
which sat aboard H.M.S. Royall Souver-
aine, lying at Spithead on the Bth of June,
1702.
On the whole, as he faced his judges—
five of those hard-bitten captains who were
beginning to make the Royal Navy the
great service it is to-day (they had largely
been assisted in this by Admirals Van Trump
and Blake) —Mr. Dampier felt fairly con-
fident in his cause. Perhaps a little censure
—possibly some indemnity to Mr. Fisher —
but hardly anything serious. Th’ese old
sea-dogs—especially the President of the
Court, Captain Sir Harry Prothero —were
too sensible of the value of discipline to
condemn readily a brother officer who had
merely been indiscreet in his application of
it to a malcontent subordinate.
Besides, he had several very reliable wit-
nesses. There was the purser of the late
Roebuck, Mr. |siddlecombe —a poor crea-
ture but dependable. There was Dick
Corbin, his boatswain and old comrade of
the Caribbean Seas in the pirating days—
his only difficulty with him had been to
restrain the exuberant enthusiasm with
which he proposed to testify on behalf of
his commander in the Roebuck. There was
Jan Pentraeth, a gunner’s mate whom he
had punished very severely and had been
on the point of marooning at Shark’s Bay
in New Holland —-surely his perjury would
count as unbiased evidence! He' really
felt that whatever Mr, Fisher might say
those three witnesses at least would be
capable of confounding him.
But Mr. Fisher’s clear, concise and effec-
tive statement plainly made an impression
upon the Court. It. seemed to bear the
impress of truth, and Mr. Dampier’s ques-
tioning of the dark-faced, bitter officer —
whose head was almost hidden between the
overhead of the Great Cabin of
the Royall Souveraine, as he stood to testify
—jdid not shake it much. A long list of
witnesses confirmed what he said very cir-
cumstantially.
Mr. Dampier read his reply to Mr.
Fisher’s charges. It was a powerful docu-
ment, and through it ran the keynote oi
“discipline must be maintained.”
Then he called his witnesses —and from
that hour Will Dampier lost all faith in
human nature that goes to sea.
Thomas Biddlecombe—that scurvy, cheat-
ing, hypocritical wretch, whose peculations
the captain of the Roebuck had winked at
—said, in effect, that owing to the peculiar
temper of her commander, the ship had been
a hell afloat, all through her long commis-
sion. Jan Pentraeth made him out a mon-
ster of vindictive cruelty, and detailed-his
own sufferings very minutely. But when
his old friend Dick Corbin gave such evi-
dence as follows, Will Dampier came to a
conclusion that there was no God in Heaven.
Question by the President: “You consider, Mr. Cor-
bin, that, on the whole, Captain Dampier did use
Mr. Fisher despitefully ?”
Answer: “Shockin’, if it please your high Honor.”
Question: “Can you give us some instance?”
Answer: “When we lay in Bahia Harbor, y’r
Honor, th’ Cap’n did propose to me that we should
drownd the First Lufftenant. Very cruel he spoke.
But I did persuade him to set him ashore instead.
W r i’ great trouble, an’t please y’r Honor.”
Question ( Captain Brazenose ) : “Did you see Cap-
tain Dampier a-beating of Mr. Fisher?”
Answer: “If it please ye, sir, he did kick him in
ye ribs as he lay swounding in his cabin, where ye
great heat had overcome him. When th’ First Luff-
tenant did recover his senses, before he was sent
ashore, Cap’n Dampier did strike him some sev’ral
times wi’ his rattan, over ye head and back, and
did call him ‘ ,’ and other ill names.”
Question Qby prisoner) : “What is your present ser-
vice?”
Answer: “I am Master’s-Mate in ye sloop Mary of
Fowey, commanded by Mr. Fisher.”
And so on, through several pages of the
minutes of proceedings. It was little won-
der that after his return from his retire-
ment whilst the Court considered its verdict
Captain Dampier should have found the
point of his sword and not the hilt —which
would have been significant of acquittal—
directed towards him as it lay upon the
table. Not that he was compelled to listen
to their damning document, which the Pre-
sident read aloud :
The Court having strictly examined into all the
particulars of their severall Informations: It is of
opinion that it has appeared to ye Court by Evidence
upon oath that Captn. William Dampier has been
guilty of very Hard and cruel usage towards Lieu-
tenant Fisher in beating him on Board ye sd. Ship,
and confining him in Irons for a considerable Time,
and afterwards Imprisoning him on shore in a
strange country, and itt is Resolved that itt dos not
appeare to ye Court by ye Evidence that there has
been any grounds for this ill usage of hirn, and that
the sd. Captain Dampier falls under ye 33rd.
Article for these his Irregular proceedings, and the
Court dos Adjudge that he be Fined all His Pay to
ye Chest at Chatham exclusive of about Fifty
Pounds stop’d in ye Treasury of ye Navies Hand
for indemnifying the Queen, # as to a Bill drawn on
ye Navy Board by Lt. Fisher from Lisbon: And itt
is farther the opinion of ye Court that the said
Capt. Dampier is not a Fitt person to be employ’d
as comdr. of any of her Maty, ships.
And the Court is of opinion that the Informa-
tion sett forth by Captn. Dampier against Lt.
Fisher have not been made good, and therefore the
Court dos Acquit him from that charge.
As they rowed him back to Portsmouth
in the evening the coxswain of the Royall
Souveraine’s boat, to his great glee, over-
heard Mr. Dampier mutter: —
“Damn the Royal Navy; damn New Hol-
land !”
