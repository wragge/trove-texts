A PAGE OF LETTERS.
Some time ago it was suggested that idle
rhymesters might glean a straw from “the
honeymoon train,” which five days a week
at 5.25 p.m. leaves Sydney for the mountains,
bearing in the season an O-so-precious freight
of all-but-happy lovers. Not many rhyme-
sters responded, and none of their rhymes
were worth print. So a poetical bill on
posterity has been drawn on the premises.
Alas ! how many poetical bills posterity will
have to dishonor !
This is not bad, in a tricky, semi-Thacke-
rayan way ; but the subject might have stimu-
lated better. Literature ought to fascinate
at the furthest whisper of a sex-cell union.
There is a good book, and an easy one, wait-
ing to be made with the title “ Hew it is
Done ; or, Different Ideas on a Delicate Sub-
ject.” Agnes Stevens has attempted some-
th'ug of the kind in “ How Men Propose ” ;
but she is a very wooden chooser of romances,
she supplies no sympathetic commentary,
and she mixes her authors horribly. Arbetter
compiler would have taken Meredith, say,
as a whole, and distilled the essence of his
exquisite love - passages ; then gone to
Dickens, and Thackeray, and George Eliot;
then over the channel and across the border
to Deutschland, and round to America, and
so every where—an Ariel among the blossoms
of Love’s literary garden. This isn’t the
order; you must go by periods, and schools,
and nations ; but there waits the book.
Not that the compiler would reap
much Australian harvest. Rolf Boldrewood
doesn’t know in the least how it is done ;
Marcus Clarke doubtless knew, but he
doesn’t tell; and even among the women,
Ethel Turner, from whom better things
were expected, merely brings Meg in with an
exquisite flush and dewy eyes after it’s all
over. Louise Mack is much more satisfac-
tory. This is Louise Mack :
He realised that Jean was in his arms, that her
head lay against his breast, and that his safety
was of strange account to her. . . . And he
put one hand under her chin, and turned her face
a little, and caught one brief glimpse of her eyes.
“ Jean, Jean, tell me, tell me. You love me.”
Her head fell back a little, and all the beauty of
her face was under his gaze, tlie eyes with a
strange new look in them. The little babyish
curls of hair, the pure soft skin, the tender half-
smiling mouth.
“ You love me,” said Musgrave.
“ I didn’t know,” said Jean childishly. She
caught her breath in a little sob.
“ My saint, my saint,” he was whispering.
He bent his head nearer, nearer. And then
through the fog two lovers kissed each other for
the sweet first time.
* • * *
This has very fair cloy for a young
author, and there is more where Jean goes
on “kissing his hair, with her arms round
his neck, and his head so close against her
heart that the little paste buttons of her
gown were cutting into his cheek.” De-
cidedly, Jean should have pasted on her wall
-—instead of “Nulla dies sine linea”—“ Every
gown sine buttons;” also, “To u jours girl
sans bones.” There is much to be said for
“l’admirable beauts de seize ans, l’expres-
sion angelique de cet age, Fame timid e et
neuve, qui consacre a l’objet de son choix
les premiers sentiments qu’elle ait jamais
Sprouves,” but, as a rule, Seize-Ans in Aus-
tralia is shockingly unpractical and squealy,
and careless how the buttons stick into you.
If N.S.W. Education Department will
add another subject to its girls’ high-schools
curriculum (Jean seems to have been a high-
school girl) The Bulletin is ready with a
professor. He might be called M. le Pro-
fesseur des Petits Soins de S’Amouracher.
* * * *
Jane Eyre is one of the English heroines
who explain most intelligently how it is done.
Jane is represented as plain and unattrac-
tive, but she nevertheless manages to secure
three proposals. True that two are from the
same man, and the third from a missionary
who does not love her—still, proposals. Jane
is a most matter-of-fact girl, and occupies
page after page with logical pros and cons
before she gives her final decision. But
here is the pith of her first pop :
“Jane, accept me quickly,” added Mr. Roches-
ter, wildly. “Say Edward—[how badly men
always want the girl to say Edward!] —give me my
name—Edward —l will marry you.”
“ Are you in earnest?—Do you truly love me?
—Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife ? ”
[This is the practical kind of girl that our High-
Schools should nourish. 3
“I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy
you, I swear it.”
“Then, sir, I will marry you.” [Jane’s doubts
are solved by the oath—she evidently believes in
“lovers’ oaths.”]
“ Edward ! [still on the same point] my little
wife ! ”
“ Dear Edward ! ” [Ah !]
“ Come to me—come to me entirely now,” [note
the “ now ”] said he; and added, in his deepest
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on
mine, “Make my happiness—l will make yours.”
“ God pardon me ! ” he subjoined ere long ;
“and man meddle not with me: I have her, and
will hold her.”
“There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no
kindred to interfere.”
“ No—that is the best of it,” he said. [Roches-
ter’s prescient mind had apparently foreboded a
mother-in-law.]
» * * *
The scene begins, by the way, when
Rochester calls Jane to come and look at a
big moth. What an aid to love is the fas-
cinating sport of insect-catching ! They dis-
cuss the moth for a time—then a nightingale
comes and sings to them—then Jane weeps
—then the rain falls. They get wet through,
which cools their ardour, and they go to bed.
It has all happened in an orchard at the foot
of a horse-chestnut tree: time, twelve
o’clock at night. Next morning Jane is
informed ‘ ■ that the great horse-chestnut at
the bottom of the orchard had been struck
by lightning in the night, and half of it split
away.” No wonder !
• * • •
Yet Jane doesn’t get married, after all.
She is led to the altar, but the marriage is
stopped by a brother of the mad first wife
whom Rochester keeps locked up. Jane
flees, and is protected by a clergyman about
to go as a missionary to India, “ who wants
a wife to be his helpmeet and fellow-laborer.”
He does not love Jane—not the least bit in
the world ; in fact, he loves another girl
devotedly ; but he thinks Jane would make
the better missionary. He wants her “as a
conductress of Indian schools, and a helper
amongst Indian women.” Jane respectfully
declines this thankless billet, and presently
gets on with the old love again. After more
argument, and any amount of unnecessary
verbiage, the third proposal comes along :
“Jane,” said Mr. Rochester, “I want a wife.”
“ Do you, sir? ”
“ Yes ; is it news to you ? ”
“Of course; you said nothing about it before.”
“ Is it unwelcome news? ”
“ That depends on circumstances, sir—or your
choice.”
“ Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will
abide by your decision.”
“ Choose then, sir— her who loves you best."
“ I will at least choose— her I love best. Jane,
will you marry me ? ”
“ Yes, sir.” [This promptness and decision are
wprthy all praise. Why will not every girl say
“Yes, sir,” as respectfully, without hesitation,
blushes, &c. ?]
“ A poor blind man, whom you will have to
lead about by the hand ? ”
“ Yes, sir.”
“A crippled man, 20 years older than you,
whom you will have to wait on ? ”
“Yes, sir.”
“ Truly, Jane ? ”
“ Most truly, sir.”
“ Oh, my darling ! God bless and reward you ! ”
* * * *
Tolerable, tolerable ; yet on reconsidera-
tion Jane seems a little too matter-of-fact.
Perhaps a shade more intoxication is desir-
able—of the kind that is made in France,
Vbici, par exemple :
La reduction de l’univers a un seul etre, la dila-
tation d’un seul Atre jusqu’A Dieu, voilk l’amour.
O printemps ! tu es une lettre qui je lui ecris.
Oh ! Atre couches edte a c6te dans le metric tom-
beau la main dans la main, et de temps en temps,
dans les tenebres, nous caresser doucement un
doigt, cela suffirait k mon eternite.
S’il n’y avait pas quelqu’un qui aime, le soleil
s’eteindrait.
These are extracts from the love-letter
which Marius puts under the stone for
Cosette, what time l’idylle Rue Plumet
lightens for a moment the gloom of “ Les
Miserables.” And then the meeting ! Poor
Marius is pale and hungry-looking, and has
lost his hat. Cosette holds on to a tree to
keep herself from falling, while Marius ex-
plains himself in an impassioned oration.
“ Si vous saviez ! je vous adore, moi.”
* # * *
Let one of Mr. Routledge’s intelligent
translators continue
“Do I offend you? ” said Marius.
“Oh my mother ! ” said Cosette. [“ Que diable
allait-effe faire dans cette galere? ”]
And she sank down as if she were dying. He
seized her in his arms, and pressed her to his
heart, not knowing what he did. He supported
her while himself tottering. He felt as jf his head
were full of smoke (!); flashes passed between his
eyelashes ; hisfideas left him, and it seemed to him
as if he were accomplishing a religious act, and
yet committing a profanation. [Then there is
omitted the little bit which proves Hugo a French-
man—Du reste, il n’avait pas le moindre desir de
cette femme ravissante dont il sentait la forme
contre wa poi trine—modest translator !]i
She took his hand and laid it on her heart; he
felt his letter there, and stammered :
“ You love me then? ”
She answered in so low a voice that it was
almost an inaudible breath :
“ Silence ! you know I do.”
And she hid her blushing face in the chest
[dans le sein—O humorous translator!] of the
proud and intoxicated young man. He fell on the
bench, and she by his side. They no longer found
words, and the stars were beginning to twinkle.
How came it that their lips met ? How comes it
that the birds sing, the snuW melts, the rose
opens, May bursts into life, and the dawn grows
white behind the black trees on the rustling tops
of the hills? [This is the sort of thing we want
from Australian writers.] One kiss, and that was
all; both trembled and gazed at each other in the
darkness with flashing eyes. [Ah, Victor knows;
he has been through the mill.]
* * • •
Then they take hands without knowing it,
and de temps en temps le genou de Marius
touchait le genou de Cosette, et tous deux
freinissaient, and par intervalles Cosette
begayait une parole—son &me tremblait a ses
levres comme une goutte de ros4e a une fleur.
Decidedly, Hugo was a great man. And by-
and-by, when they are about to be parted,
Cosette weeps for more than two hours by
the side of Marius qui songeait; and finally,
“ without saying a word, both fell into each
other’s arms without noticing that their lips
were joined together, while their upraised
eyes, overflowing with ecstasy, contemplated
the stars.” Unluckily Hop. is too busy to
make a picture of this interesting embrace,
but readers may practise it for themselves.
The Bulletin guarantees satisfactory results.
Just try : lips joined, and look at the stars.
* * * •
After all this, some lines from Lowell’s
pretty picture of how it is done Down-East
will come as a pick-me-up.
THE HONEYMOON TRAIN.
Hark how the chill westerly rattles the windows !
I’ll draw up my chair to the side of the fire.
That new book, I fancy, must wait till to-morrow —
I’m lazy, and old eyes so easily tire.
By George ! good cigar, this ! Nell chose it, and
lit it,
And thrust me in here till she clears things
away :
A nice little dinner she gave me this evening—
Soup, fish, p&te, salad and cheese—all O.K.
Dear Nellie ! Heigho, as I stare at the embers,
The years roll away down their dusty old track:
I mind well the first time I saw her —at Harry’s—
Her father was dead : she was still wearing
black.
All black, with an old-fashioned brooch made of
silver,
And chatelaine of silver, and quaint silver belt,
She looked —how she looked 1 . . there, that
coal in the centre !
That’s she !...*h, the picture’s beginning to melt.
In three months we married —let’s see—eighteen*
ninety :
Just forty years gone—how the time slips away 1
The thirteenth—no, was it? —the fifteenth—yes,
fifteenth :
Why, hang it! we’re forty years married to-day !
Whew ! now je comprends—all those little side-
glances !
Her color, her chatter, the dress that she wore !
The wine, this cigar ! why, I smelt something
extra —
Old duffer I was not to see it before !
All years ago ? Nonsense! it happened this morn-
ing—
The wedding, the breakfast, the table all set
And people all glarirg—O Lord ! they encored
me!
A dream ! no, I feel the rice down my back yet.
And then comes a mist, but I know at the station
I wrung the guard’s hand : did he think me in-
sane ?
Then handk-reluefs waving—“Good-b.ye and God
hb as you ! ”
A whi-tle ! we re off by the honeymoon train !
That journey ! O, Paradise holds nothing sweeter !
(What bliss can be bought for a twelve shilling
fare !)
With Nell on my knee (she got off at the
stations)
Pretending to scold when I let down her hair.
And now we’ve arrived, and had welcome and
dinner,
And Nell for a moment has gone to our room—
Our room ! O delicious !—I think that’s her foot-
step :
We’ll sit—not too long—and spend love in the
gloom.
“ Cigar out! No gas lit!" My dear, I’ve been
dozing ! . . .
How well you look, Nellie! your eyes shine
again.
What, kisses! Hang grey hairs! I’m gay three-
and-twenty—
God bless us! we’re off by the honeymoon train.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was .confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney'.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. 1 tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. . .
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances vvhich
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in bis
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tendernessof the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow' discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

BEFORE YOU
T ■ E -A- F !
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. • There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer —for you to plead : There would have

A VISION OF THE GRUESOME.
In a humpy, where at noontide came a breathing
of Gehenna,
And you couldn’t see the rafters for the dust
and smoke and flies,
I was pondering what paragons the “ bushy ” type
of men are,
When a fine old bushy specimen before me did
arise.
I really can’t describe him, for each second seemed
to change him: _
One moment he was giant-like, then dwindled
to a dwarf;
He tried quite hard to stop it, but a second would
derange him,
And he muttered “ Don’t you mind me if 1
seem a trifle off.
“ I’m the chap the poets talk of : I’m a stockman,
I’m a shearer;
I appear in many stories of the wild and woolly
West;
And the more they write about me I feel queerer
still and queerer,
For I feel in solid earnest what they talk about
in jest.
“ For, you know, I’ve no existence save in dark
imaginations
Of the poets and the proseists in their stories
and their rhymes;
They make me work at mining, and at droving,
and on stations,
And between the lot of them, you bet, I have
some awful times.
“ They kill me in all sorts of ways to give a dismal
finish
To the yarns they tell about me, and 1 sadly
apprehend .
That these writers have a notion —which I hope
will soon diminish —
That in order to get pathos they must kill me
in the end.
“So I save all sorts of people in all sorts of rivers
daily,
But always die because of it—l drown or hit a
snag;
I often ride like hell—awake a big buck jumper
gaily
To bring a doctor in from town—and then I
crack my scrag.
“ Excuse the language that I use, for that’s
another trouble,
For sometimes I’m a languid swell from Eng-
land’s whitewashed hills,
And sometimes I’m a bullocky whose voice is full
of rubble,
Or a native spitting curses with the juices from
his gills.
“ All day and night they’re at it, reeling off all
sorts of stories,
(All pure imagination, as I said to you before)
Of my comings and my goings and my life and all
its glories, _ . ,
Till it’s my opinion, mister, that the thing s
become a bore.”
Then again the twitching took him, and he mur-
mured “ Here’s another;
He is writing a new story ” —here the squirming
features sneered —_
“ He wants me on a station where it’s hot enough
to smother: _ . .
I’m coming ! Oh, I’m coming ! ” And the vision
disappeared.
Sydney.
ZEE.
RUSTY.
Rusty the trusty, heel up the cattle !
That white calf sulks till a man would swear ;
But you only snap at his heels and hustle
The little devil who stands to stare.
Nip at the heels of the weary stragglers,
So - not too far or a breath too near ;
You won’t be brained by the dun pea-eater
As your foolish brother was brained last year.
Perils many have oft assailed you —
You come of a danger-loving breed,
But you keep well clear of the new-chum flopping
From neck to tail of his plunging steed.
“ Rusty the lusty ” I used to call you
When the world was young and our hearts
were light,
And I carried you for a league before me
On my saddle bow thro’ the day and night.
You would play when I camped at noontide,
squealing
For very joy of your careless youth ;
With your big, soft eyes and ungainly body,
You weren’t a beauty, and that’s the truth.
And now I work for my keep and wages
Thro’ heat and cold, for the times are hard ;
You work as well for a little kindness
And a few old scraps from the killing yard.
“ Rusty the fusty ” some might call you—
That stiff hind leg gives your walk a slew—
But you save me many a weary gallop,
Old dog, I’m thinking the world of you ;
Not only because in a bygone summer
White hands I loved would your head caress ;
Not only because you have never left me,
But just a little of both, I guess.
Rusty, your day’s work is nearly over,
I soon would tire of this world alone,
And I would ’twere so that we might change
places
When the green star-grass o’er your bones has
grown.

city, have placed upon this market at a Price Hitherto XJll-
knowil Here a Cigar of exceptional quality. ” '
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.!! —will at first no doubt
be prejudicial y but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note- Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

The Borrowing-Boom.
The borrowing-boom shows signs of breaking
out afresh in Australasia. Within the last
few days no less than three loans have been
more or less definitely announced by as many
different provinces. Maoriland proposes to
borrow £1,000,000, partly for railway-con-
struction and partly for road-and-bridge and
miscellaneous purposes, and the old curse of
You el, -ism is apparently coming back by in-
stalments upon the land. A few years ago
Maoriland—then wrecked and desperate and
almost insolvent—swore-off borrowing and
set itself to live honestly. Then it resumed
borrowing in a small way, and unobtrusively,
in the local market. Then it began to float
large loans in an indirect sort of fashion —2|
millions on behalf of the Bank of New
Zealand, and millions for the State Land
Bank—and apologised for them on the ground
that they were not for public works purposes
and therefore did not indicate a reversion to
the great borrowing-disease of the Yogel
days. And now, as Maoriland purposes
going in undisguisedly for a big loan, it would
seem that the old garish times are coming
back, and that the aggregate national hog is
returning to his wallow. N.S. Wales also
proposes to float a loan within the next few
months—amount not yet stated. Westralia
contemplates a loan of about £5,000,000,
which, in proportion to population,
will be the biggest financial operation
ever dreamt of in Australia, and on
the strength of it the Red Dust Land
should have such an orgie as no province in
this part of the world ever heard of before.
Tasmania is also said to be contemplating a
loan, and probably one or other of the
remaining three provinces will rise up and
borrow manfully within the next twelve
months. So far as present appearances go,
the financial year which has just commenced
promises well in the borrowing line.
* * * *
It is a curious circumstance that, in fifty
years of continuous loan-mongering, none of
the Australias has defined by statute the
items of expenditure which it is lawful to
defray out of loans, and those which should
be met out of current revenue. This matter
has been left entirely to the honesty or dis-
honesty of the Government which happened
to be in power, and its majority. In N.S.
Wales, at one time, it was the habit to bor-
row for “ reproductive works,” which was a
vague terlii and of great elasticity. Souie-
times it was supposed to mean works which
Were directly reproductive in the sense that
they brought in actual cash to the Treasury.
Sometimes it covered works that were in-
directly reproductive, inasmuch as they were
held, on no very certain evidence, to make
the country richer, and by doing so were
supposed to swell the drink or tobacco tax
or other sources of revenue: The present
Government changed the term to “repro-
ductive and permanent works,” which could
be made to cover almost everything, and
under this heading it shoved in works which
were purely temporary and not visibly pro-
ductive in any sense—wooden bridges, new
roads, gaols, homes for the aged, alterations
to old dredges, and all manner of things. In
New South Wales, there is absolutely nothing
which it is unlawful to pay out of borrowed
money if the Treasurer feels so inclined, and
the country isn’t looking.
* * * *
The tendency to charge everything to
loan-expenditure that can, with any sem-
blance of decency or even without it, be put
there, is distinctly increasing in N.S. Wales,
though it is hardly noticeable in the other
provinces. In 1887, New South Wales
owed £41,000,000, and of this nearly
£36,000,000 was invested in railways, tram-
ways, telegraphs, and other works which
gave a direct return to the Treasury, leaving
only £5,000,000 sunk in unproductive or
almost unproductive investments. In 1895
the productive works represented £47,000,000
out of a total debt of 56| millions, therefore
in eight years the amount of borrowed money
spent in undertakings which yield no re-
venue, and which should justly be defrayed
out of taxation, was about £4,500,000.
Queensland, in 1887, had a debt of 26| mil-
lions, of which eight millions was buried in
works which returned little or no revenue ;
in 1895, out of a debt of a little over 30
millions, the amount that was unproductive
remained almost exactly the same. In S.A.,
during the same period, things grew no worse,
and in Victoria the amount spent on non-
revenue-producing works only increased
between 1887 and 1895 by about £1,000,000.
Therefore, it would seem that this joyous
style of financing belongs almost solely to
New South Wales among the four principal
provinces of the mainland, and is one of the
chief sources of its revenue surpluses when
it has any, and of the apparent prosperity of
its Treasury under a very moderate system
of taxation.
* * * *
When there is no definite limit to the
variety of works, or even of salaries, that
may be charged to loan expenditure, it is
obvious that any kind of Treasurer can pro-
duce a surplus out of almost any kind of
material. When the Retd Government
brought down its loan estimates a year ago,
and announced its intention of spending
£450,000 on railways and £1,100,000 on
roads, bridges, miscellaneous repairs, and
non-productive works generally, it broke
even the bad record of New South Wales in
this respect, and showed itself, on a rough
estimate, considerably worse than the worst
of its bad predecessors in the matter of
“ faking ” the national ledger. If it had
done, in this matter what Victoria and
South Australia and Queensland have been
doing, almost all these £1,100,000 worth of
works would have been charged to revenue,
and there would have been a glorious deficit
of at least £500,000. Yet it only went where
a bad system led it, and where the same
system will inevitably lead the other pro-
vinces by-and-bye if they once get started
on a large scale upon the same road.
The business of every N.S.W. Treasurer, as
affairs are now understood, is to do three
things. The first is not to increase taxation
and to reduce it if possible. The second is
to keep in repair all the public roads and
bridges and other works, which grow more
numerous and, therefore, more expensive
every year ; to make new ones which cost
money for construction now and add to the
bill for maintenance later on ; and generally
to keep every branch of the public service in
good order. And the third is to produce a
surplus out of a revenue that is diminished
by reduced taxation, and with an expendi-
ture which must keep increasing despite all
economies. And as the country doesn’t
trouble about how it is done, and the press
hails the man with a surplus, no matter how
bogus, as a heaven-born financier, and asks
few questions, and the Government party
supports him, and the denunciations of the
Opposition count for very little, because the
Opposition is there to denounce in any case,
the surplus is almost always made in the
same way. The honest Treasurer who tries
to make the country pay its way must either
increase taxation or retrench enormously, or
do both at once—or else have a deficit; and
he is generally wrecked either way. ’ The
dishonest one who makes his £309,000 sur-
plus by charging perhaps £900,000 of his
ordinary expenditure to loans, is a brilliant
success. And as it doesn’t pay to be an
absolutely honest Treasurer in New South
W ales there has been no such person in that
province for a very long while. There have
been Treasurers of various degrees of dis-
honesty, and that is all.
* * ♦ »
Obviously some reform is called for The
Government of the moment is the’ party
with the majority, and the majority, under
the party system, votes as the Government
bids it. Therefore, it is practically left to
the Government to “fake” the public ac-
counts as it pleases. The self-evident remedy
is to declare, by the most hard-and-fast
statute which can be devised, exactly what
things and no others may be charged to loans.
In The Bulletin’s opinion, borrowing, ex-
cept for renewal purposes, should be alto-
gether abolished, regardless of cost; but,
recognising that it is at present in a hopeless
minority on this question, this paper suggests
that the flotation of loans should be allowed for
three purposes only—the conversion of old
loans as they fall due, the defence of the
country in case of actual war, and the con-
struction of works that will yield a direct
and permanent revenue which seems likely
to equal at least 3 per cent, on their cost.
This third proviso would admit of borrowing
for tramway, railway, telegraph and tele-
phone construction ; for the purpose of es-
tablishing a State Bank, State Land Bank,
or similar profitable undertakings ; and for
water-conservation and irrigation purposes,
provided a portion at least of the values thus
created were permanently appropriated by
the State per medium of a betterment-tax or
otherwise—in fact, it would cover many
things and be almost too elastic. But,
at the same time, it would shut
down hard on the practice of charging
roads, bridges, fortifications, guns, dredging
operations, and many other like items to the
loan estimates. If it was too elastic it would
at least be less elastic than the present sys-
tem, which has practically no end or limita-
tion whatever.
* * * *
The change above suggested ought to do
something, though perhaps not much, towards
promoting political honesty. In Australia
of late years more Governments have been
wrecked by their real or apparent financial
incapacity than by any other cause, but so
long as the alleged surplus is the only
measure of financial capacity matters are not
likely to improve. It is necessary to do
something towards putting all Treasurers on
a level; the system which ejects the man
with an honest deficit, and makes a small tin
god of the one with a dishonest balance on
the right side of the ledger, is wholly
nefarious. Moreover, the introduction
of such a measure would at least make
the country consider where it is going. It
is one thing to silently acquiesce in the
charging of current expenditure to loans when
it is practically certain that the country will
pass the circumstance unnoticed, and quite
another to move and openly vote for an
amendment to the effect that the bill for
patching decayed wooden bridges and the
like is a fair thing to pass on to posterity.
Even the most aggressive and unscrupulous
roads and bridges politician would probably
draw the line at thus openly committing
himself. And, in any case, if such things
are to be charged to posterity, it should be
done with all possible publicity, so that as
much of posterity as is within hearing will
know what lies before it, and the person who
lends the money may be informed by statute
what kind of people he is lending it to.

sent to the Australian press, which gives the
result to the public well mixed with imagina-
tion and a strict defiance of facts. U.S.A.
news in the Australian press is a fine proof that
the Well of Truth is the bottomless pit. It
also suggests what a dangerous thing it would
be to have a direct cable to San Francisco.

The cable now says there is a big U.S A
rally on behalf of “free coinage of silver’”--
and it may be true, nevertheless. A consider-
able minority of the Republicans, and a con-
siderable majority of the Democrats are
hustling themselves to put silver on its “ proper
basis’’—and The Bulletin finds itself in the
invidious position of discussing the accursed
currency question. The Prophet Amos some
time since, cursed the people who went in for
making the ephali small and the shekel
great . that they might buv the poor
for silver and The Bulletin is disposed to
agtee with that gentleman’s curse in a general
i,ig ° ted “““i* <»

Mexico Were d ° Sed in 1893 ’ To-day
Mexico is the only country of any importance
which will coin silver “ freely he., on the
same terms that Sydney or Melbourne Mints
will coin gold. The Populist-parly in the
States cries aloud that silver is t,iie people’s
money—and that, it is refused admission to the
people s mints because the gold-bugs of Wall-
street and the naked farmers ol India’s cholera
strand wish it to be so. The demonetisation of
silver—says the Populist-party—paralyses all
the forces of production, shuts out labor from
employment, increases the burden of public and
private debt, and sends desolation to the homes
of the poor. Early in 1895 the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture found that the average
value of improved farm land in Nebraska (the
“boy orator’s” state) bad fallen 25 per cent, in
the previous 10 years—similar figures being
given for other agricultural states. The farmers
suffering from low prices readily unite with
the miners from closed mines when the cry
goes through the land that it is the closed Mint
that is doing the mischief.
« * * *
Suppose the Populist-party wins? Suppose
the Mints at Philadelphia, San Francisco, New
Orleans, and Carson invite citizens to bring
silver to be turned into dollars?—millions of
dollars will immediately get into circulation,
and local prices will rise. These are generally
admitted propositions. Further effects postn
lated by the gold-party and fervently scouted
by the silver-party are—that gold will leave
the country ; that silver will flow into the
country unless stopped by a tariff; that the
States would, like India and China, have a
silver currency alone ; that public credit would
be smashed up, many private concerns being
driven insolvent ; that the States would be left
with a depreciating currency, and with no more
outlet that at present for its silver product.
One argument for this latter statement is that
the States have purchased (under the Acts of
’73, ’75, ’7B and ’9O) no less than 496,984,8890 z.
at a cost of ,£101,000,000 sterling. On the
other hand, the very plethora of silver in the
currency, and the enormous cost of keeping
gold-reserves (by the sale of gold bonds, etc.,
in a doubtfully legal manner) is advanced by
leading financial journals in London as a reason
for frankly going over to silver.
* * * *
Altogether, The Bulletin is very glad that
it is one of its fixed principles to say as little
as it can about the currency tangle.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Not Before Pa.”
There is now a Bill before N.S.W. Parliament,
which, if passed, will prevent the near relative
of any Judge practising before him. The Bill
has a good chance of becoming law ; the Lower
House will pass it, and the Upper is not likely
to stand in t he way. Some of the lights of the
profession, who are not personally affected,
have spoken strongly against the tendency of
Judges’ relations to monopolise the legal work
in certain courts, while it has for long been a
source of irritation and complaint amongst the
“juniors,” who are affected. The Bulletin
does not for one moment suppose that any
Supreme Court Judge would knowingly allow
himself to be influenced in his decision by
the fact that his son, or any other relative,
happened to be appearing for one of
the suitors before him ; but it would not
undertake to say that even a Supreme Court
Judge would not be unconsciously biassed by
that fact. The main thing, however, is that
many people do think the Judges tire amenable
to such influence, nor can they be blamed for
so doing. The idea is encouraged bv attorneys
who, while they brief, and even insist on their
clients briefing, a junior barrister when (say)
the father of that barrister is to hear the case,
take good care to seek out more experienced
counsel if “pa” is not going to preside over
the trial. The Bulletin has heard of a case
where, on the very morning of the trial, the
plaintiff’s attorney rushed a third brief round
to a Judge’s son. Why ? Because that morn-
ing the Judges changed their Courts, and the
case was to lie heard by that junior’s progeni-
tor. Again, it is palpable to both profession
and public that the incomes of some coun-
sel, who made a very “good thing”
when their relatives were on the bench,
fell off astonishingly when their relatives
retired—or w'ere granted leave of absence.
No English Judge permits his son to practise
before him ; botli bench and bar have sternly set
their faces against such a proceeding. The
Judges there were not so thick-skinned as to
refrain from taking action in the matter till
their hands were forced by the threat of legis-
lative prohibition ; and it is greatly to he
regretted that the Judges of N.S. Wales as a
body have not followed their English “brothers”
in this respect “ as a body,” for it is an open
secret that at least one N.S.W. Judge on his
elevation to the bench intimated to his son
(who was at the bar) that he would not sit in
any case in which he (the son) appeared ; and
that son never did appear before his father.
This custom also subjects the other members of
the profession to undue and unfair competition,
and so cannot fail to react prejudicially on
the public. It may be objected that such
an enactment will press heavily on the
numerous offspring, connections, and relatives
of the Judges. This is questionable ; at
any rate, these gentlemen will only be in the
same position as every other member of the bar,
and will have to depend for their success on
their knowledge of their work, and not on the
adventitious position of their kinsmen. An end
must be put to what may soon develop into a
great scandal, even though ending it does mean
cutting-down the earnings of some of the
members of the bar. The Bulletin would
consider that a far less evil than that the
slightest pretext should be given for casting a
slur on the holders of any judicial office, or for
suspecting the purity of the administration of
justice.
The Ballad of Brunner Mine.
[On March 26, ’96, an explosion of collected in uncared-
for workings of Brunner colliery, M.L., entombed some
60 miners. Nearly all were married men, with large
families ; none of them came out alive. The accident
was regarded as a national disaster; and Premier Sedd ,
travelled to be present with the brave and generous mu l


G Keid’s Pacts and Fantasies.
When Premier Re n, of N.S.W., presented his
■ recent budget, he ielt moved in his inside to fire
off his usual statement about the liouois o
Protection as evidenced by the present state o
■ things in Victoria, and the beauties of Free-
rtrade as evidenced by the present state of
■ things in New South Wales. And, as ls
■ usually the case when he touches statistics, the
old man fell in miserably and abjectly, tie
■ presented a list of 121 articles which are
included in the stores purchased by the ( *o vern
meats of both provinces, and pointed out that
•owing to the awful way prices were swelled by
Piotection these articles, which cost in JN.o. -
a little over £lO,OOO a year, cost m \ ictoria
over £21,000. The Foreign-trade papers of
Sydney announced next day that this was an
indubitable evidence of the advantages of the
itnported-shoddy policy, and Premier Reid
stated joyously that it was “a piece of cola
iron for Protectionists to chew. Since then,
however, things have gone very badly with this
beautiful legend. In the first place, a reference
to the Victorian tariff shows that a large num-
ber of the duties quoted in the list are wholly
and idiotically wrong. Further, the fact that
less than one-tenth of the stores bill is dealt
with apparently shows that Premier Reid
didn’t attempt to institute a fair all-round
comparison, but merely picked out the
very few items which supported Ins
tle.rv, and meanly suppressed those that
told against it. He also suppressed the
fact that in Victoria the contractor pays
the cost of delivering goods to all parts of tli
province, while in Sydney this charge is borne
by the Government, so that Victorian pi ices
include carriage and New South Wales prices
do not. Further, the Victorian Government
reports that it is engaged in carefully checking
t he alleged Melbourne prices, and that so tar as it
ltas gone the figures supplied by Premier Reid
are merely an unmitigated ANANIAS or words
to that effect. Some of the figures which the
Vic. Government is alleged to pay for goods m
large quantities are higher than the ordinary
retail prices in Melbourne, and, in a general
r rli the Victor™,

One item of sealing-wax, put down at i.bo, is
said to be really £343 ; one ink-bill is alleged to

from £337 to £531. On 19 items out of the 121
it is solemnly reported that Premier Skids

is therefore that he is deliberately perverti g

The Spirit of Wild Cat Production.
Westralia, according to a Mr. TV. TV. Gar-
lile, who wrote a paper which has been read
to the Sydney Economic Association, hasjts
views of economics; and naturallj , m
lia’s present condition, they are wildly amusing.

therefore, it seems, can live m Westralia with

production is due to this new factorr;
W W. Oarlxle is astonished that senu #
mental moralists and Labor-party politicians
should regard “the spirit of enterprise, of specu
lation, of g gambling ”in the light ? f “
since Westraliaprovesitto be Labor s ’
Then the Economic Association went borne

The new light that comes from the TV est to the

Dear Bulletin,— You say in a recent para-
graph • “The principal adversary of the
woman-doctor is the woman who, perhaps all
unknown to herself, is influenced by the subtle
sex instinct.” That is true of communities in
which ' be male doctor—thanks to the monks of
old. who professed leechcraft-has long been
accented as a common necessary of lire. Llieie
the women, as a rule, are not yet quite prepaied
to renounce the faith of their foremothers and
their conservatism is strengthened, no doubt,
by t-lie sex instinct, which custom has cor-
rupted. They are apt to regard sickness as a
form of dissipation—a decent excuse for being
pawed, examined, or talked to on delicate su -
iecls by a creature in trousers. He is their
licensed libertine, holding a cerlif. bom
Mrs. Grundy. His presence at their bed-
side gives them a novel nervous sensation.
But in countries where the woman-doctor is
the only doctor for women the “ subtle sex in-
stinct ” retains its original modesty, and scorns
the thought of prostituting itself to medical
men. Circumstances have caused the female
instinct as regards doctors to act one way in
Asia and another way in Europe. American
women, with 3000 of their sisters already
qualified to treat their ailments, are rapidly
reverting to the modest Asiatic instinct. Aus-
tralia will follow suit.—E.E.
The Truck Bill—to abolish, as far as possible,
the practice of compelling employes to deal at
the boss’s store and buy at the boss s prices
which practically amounts to the confiscation of
a large part of the nominal wage—and the Shops
and factories Bill, two measures which the
Reid Government is urging through JN.vb.VV.
Parliament, are matters on which a dig tight
with the Leg. Council may be expected, tliey
are both distinctly democratic ideas, and tne
Council, where Premier Reid’s ten nominees
are fast becoming fossilised like the rest, is now
almost as Tory as it used to be. One g aring
defect in the Shops and lactones Bill is worth
noticing. Like the Maoriland law, it prohibits
employes taking their meals in the work-room.
But unlike the Maoriland law', it doesn t
compel the owner to provide a dining-room, so
presumably the shop-girl and faetoiy-gnl wil
be fired into the street in the name of reform
and progress, to eat her lunch publicly on the
edge of the pavement. The Maoriland system
is logical. The -N.S.W. idea isn t ; it goes
half-way and then stops.
A CORRESPONDENT writes as follows :
Premier Dick Sbddon, of M.L., is bringing in a Bill
intended to prevent usury. Maximum interest payable
or recoverable to be 8 per cent., and when no rate of
interest is specified, then 6 per cent. only. Loans to be
full cash without deduction, all loans renewable at same
rate and payable at one month’s notice or one months
interest But what Sbddon forgets is that usury cannot
be so put down ; in fact, it actually increases the interest
bv increasing the risk to Ikey Mo, and, as Ikey Mo has the
bank balance and Emptyfur.se has
“ I tout vont to lent money my vrent, but t M'u musr
bate it vv look at the risk I run. lean tdo it toi less
than two huntret per shent.” And Emi'typußSE has to
pay or go without.
This is the common view 7 of the case, but the
Bulletin disagrees with the common view,.as
usual The man who borrows from L Mo
almost always ends in the Insolvency Court.
If he can’t get money from Isaac Mo-owing to
the usury laws, then he will simply go to the
Insolvency Court before he has been through
Mo’S hands instead of going there after. I het e-
fore, there is no hardship m the client
having to go without. The usury law can t
well make things worse for the borrower ; the
average Mo. now takes everything he lias, and
however much lie wants to raise Ins rates to
cover extra risk, be can’t take more than that
As things are he almost always drives lus client
into bankruptcy ; under the proposed usury
law it will be far less safe to do so because
then the story of the 200 per shent will be told
to the Official Assignee, and lie will make \ery
bad trouble for the usurer. In other words.
Mo will have quite a new incentive to keep
bis client out of bankruptcy. It is all very
good to say that the change will make the
lender more exorbitant than he is; the writer,
as a person who has borrowed from many Jews
and others in many lands, confidently reports
that he can’t be more exorbitant than lie is
You might as well try to make a corpse deader
than it is.

More About State Audits.
A certain Parliamentary inquiry which is now
proceeding in Melbourne is beginning to grow
interesting. It started as an investigation into
the doings of a shoddy little friendly society,
and from this point it is gradually branching off
into life-insurance matters in general, and the
necessity for a reform in the laws relating
thereto. So far as the trouble has gone the
chief question dealt with has been that of State
supervision or State audit of life-insurance
offices, and round this point the- inquiry has
raged exceedingly. A number of experts have
given evidence—most of them persons connected
with life-insurance; and these people have been
asked their opinion of State supervision, which
means the appointment of a Government autho-
rity to overhaul their balance-sheets, and value
their securities, and ask all manner of unplea-
sant questions ; and they have been tolerably
unanimous in replying that State supervision
was of no earthly use. Secretary Teece, of
the A.M.P. Society, one of the bitterest oppo-
nents of State interference, put the case for the
present loose method as follows :
The effect of the American system where there was
State supervision had been to lead the people to rely on
the certificate of the superintendent as a proof of sol-
vency, and the public caution had been lulled into a false
security. It was assumed that every society which had
the State certificate was solvent and worthy of support.
Some years ago he investigated the matter, and found
from his own inquiries that no less than 109 life assurance
companies, with the State certificate of solvency, had
gone bankrupt. He did not have the fullest sources of
information, but he would hand in a pamphlet published
in America, which gave the names of 822 life companies,
of which only 48 were in existence in 1888. A number of
them never went into business at all, but they all had
State authority to do business. The principle of British
legislation was to require every company which solicited
public patronage to give the fullest publicity to its pro-
ceedings. In America, the returns were made to the
superintendent, and published in a large volume annually,
which the public never saw. The superintendents, being
political appointees, were frequently corrupt He was
personally acquainted with a company in America which
produced its securities for the inspection of the superin-
tendent, and next week those securities were lent to
another society, and produced to the inspector again. It
was a most dangerous thing to give the public the idea
that they were not to look after their own interests. All
that the State should do was to insist on the fullest
publicity. In that respect the West Australian Act was
perfect. An actuary could make figures prove anything
so long as he was not compelled to give the basis upon
upon which he made his calculations. But in West Aus-
tralia the societies were required not only to state the
principles upon which the valuations were made, but to
give actual examples of each class of premium upon which
the calculations were made. The Victorian Act was
defective in that respect, and easily evaded. The experts
will expose anything wrong so long as the material is
supplied, and the press, which is free and independent,
will also guard the public safety. The Insurance and
Banking Record, published in Melbourne, has probably
not a superior in the financial world as a sound critic.
* » * *
This is a vigorously-expressed but wholly one-
sided view of the case. In the first place, the
publicity which Mr. Teece demands is appar-
ently with regard to the actuarial calculations
only. These are mysterious and unfathomable
things bristling with x and z , and wandering
amid great wastes of logarithms, and with
decimals and strange geometry sticking out all
over them. The press doesn’t expose these if
they are wrong. As a rule, the said press isn’t
one-hundredth part so free and indepen-
dent as Mr. Teece alleges—in fact, it is
mostly a servile and incompetent thing
which is governed by advertisements, and
which no more dares to criticise so stu-
pendous a concern as the A.M.P. Society
than it dares to throw road-metal at the Al-
mighty. But, even if it was absolutely free
and independent, it is doubtful if there is one
editor or sub editor in Australia who is quali-
fied to fully understand and criticise the pro-
found calculations which JMr. Teece suggests
should be made public. An actuary could do
it ; but most actuaries are in the same business
themselves, and may have good reason for not
exposing each other. Moreover, if an expert
did ciiticise the actuarial calculations of any
society and allege that they were wrong, and
another expert rose up as a matter of course
and alleged that they were right, and other ex-
pel ts joined in and raged tumultuously over the
question, the public would remain practically
as unenlightened as before. And, in any case,
it is not in the actuarial calculations that the
trouble wholly lies. When they have been
effected they show that the liabilities of the
office are so much, and the management pro-
ceeds to show' that the assets are so much and a
little over. And here the free and independent
press doesn t come in, and public opinion is
practically useless.
* * * »
The press can’t make bricks without straw -
neither can the public. If the assets have de-
preciated to such an extent that they don’t
nearly meet the liabilities, the press—if it was
free and independent— might expose the fact if
it knew what the assets were, but it doesn’t.
!buch great slabs of information as “ Mortgages
£i, 000,000,” give no information whatever’
lhe press, on which Mr. Teece throws the
responsibility of exposing anything that is
wrong, doesn’t know where these mortgages
are, what the securities are, what is the amount
lent on each security, or anything else about
them. It has absolutely no facts—not the
shadow or semblance of a fact—to go upon.
Also it has no possible means of getting suffi-
cient facts. And if it had them no paper could
undertake to send experts all over seven pro-
vinces to check the information supplied.
Under these circumstances the press must needs
decline with emphasis to be any guarantor of
the solvency or insolvency of any life-insurance
society. The public, as a guarantor, is still
more futile. The public is the man in the
street—the bald-headed person at the back of
the omnibus—who gets his information from
the press, and the press has little information to
give save what the societies supply about them-
selves—which is always good, or about each
other which is generally bad and libellous and
unreliable.
* * * *
The fact that the A.M.P. and all the other
leading societies are run on the mutual prin-
ciple means practically nothing. Their members
are scattered from Perth to Fiji, and from the
Blufl to Port Darwin, and in many other coun-
tries besides. About one in 1000 of these get
together in a room once a year and elect the
directors and auditors (it is, on the whole, very
much like a lot of Italian Cardinals located at
Rome electing an Italian Pope), and two or three
in 1000 send proxies for the same purpose. Very
few of them personally know anything about the
directors or the auditors or anybody else. They
judge them by previous results, and they judge
the previous results by the balance-sheet, and
the balance-sheet is mostly the work of the
same directors and auditors. The auditors, in
many cases, make no serious pretence of know-
ing the value of the widely-scattered assets,
and don t allege that they have made any ex-
haustive valuation—in fact, it doesn’t definitely
appear that they make any valuation at all.
Ihe directors are presumably, in many cases,
the same as other directors—and the average
director, when the trouble comes, says that he
trusted entirely to the manager. There seems
to be no definite obligation upon anybody to
have an independent valuation made of the
assets at any fixed intervals, nor any guarantee
that the valuation, when it is made, is so in-
dependent as it should be. If the press or the
public, however, should grow suspicious it can
undoubtedly bring about an independent audit
and valuation of the whole business. But
things have, in most cases, to be irredeemably
bad before enough information leaks out to
cause serious suspicion. And then the only
means of doing anything is to work up such a
panic as will move the great, slow, inert public,
and to do that would practically mean wrecking
the whole society which, as the suspicion miijht
prove unfounded, is a responsibility that hardly
one reputable person in a continent would care
to risk. What is wanted is a system of imle-
dependent investigation which will work auto-
matically, without panic or wreckage, and
which will be at work constantly, so that it
will find out any signs of insolvency long before
the insolvency becomes so aggravated as to
obtrude itself on the public gaze.
* » * *
The American system of State audit is cer-
tainly imperfect, like everything else, but at
the same time it is hardly so imperfect as Mr.
Teece represents it. The fact that many com-
panies have gone bankrupt under it is not an
evidence of its uselessness ; it is rather a strong
proof of the value of the system. In the United
States an insurance office must conform to a
certain fixed standard of solvency, whereas
there is no fixed standard in Australia; its
liabilities are checked by the State auditors,
and its assets valued to see if they are sufficient
to provide for these liabilities. As it is im-
possible that all State auditors can be wholly
corrupt, this periodical overhaul must be worth
something, however little. If the society proves
solvent, no matter by how small a margin, its
license is renewed until next audit. If at the
next audit its assets have dropped below the
line of solvency, its license is not renewed, and
it is compelled to suspend operations before
things become any worse. The fact that so
large a number of offices have been closed up
shows that the State audit has at least some
good points. Then the concern has either to
wind up, or to write down the value of its
policies to a point which the assets will cover
and go on, or to transfer its business in this
written-down condition and its assets to some
other office. In Australia an insurance society
which has got down below the limit of solvency
can go on getting worse, or getting better, or
remaining the same for fifty years or any other
period, so long as it successfully over-values its
assets or under - estimates its liabilities and
thereby makes the balance-sheet look solvent.
Despite the fact that State auditors may be
often corrupt and incompetent, and that they
may be fooled by cute and dishonest managers
and directors, still the American system is
vastly better than the Australian one, if only
on the ground that two audits can hardly be
worse or less reliable than one.
* * * *
The American system, at all events, has the
great merit of publicity.. The State reports
are published and presented to the Legislature,
so that the local Chick can get at them and
criticise them, and they are accessible to
whoever cares to pay for them, though probably
few people do care. These reports set forth the
assets in detail and the value of each—a piece
of information which is wholly unobtainable in
this country—and, therefore, everybody can do
something towards satisfying himself” of the
solvency of the concern merely by inspecting
those assets which come under his immediate
observation. Even supposing the U.S. De-
partment is corrupt, that fact has no bearing
on the case of Australia. If there are in this
country, as Mr. Teece implies, a large number
of men of such spotless honesty that they can
be trusted to run the insurance-business with
no supervision worth mentioning, then this
is such a beastly honest country that it
could easily supply insurance - auditors who
are not corrupt, and these auditors, even if
they are wholly superfluous to-day, may come
in handy by-and-bye. And the insurance busi-
ness, above all others, needs to be beyond all
suspicion. The rotten bank reveals itself,
despite the concealments of managers, directors
and auditors, when the inevitable run comes,
though, as recent evidences have shown, half
its alleged assets may have vanished before
then. The rotten insurance society, not being
subject to runs by depositors, need not reveal
itself, except by accident, so long as the new
premiums are sufficient to pay claims, no matter
where its alleged assets have gone. The ques-
tion is not one of reliance upon the State verms
reliance by the public on itself. The public,
under present conditions, doesn’t rely on itself;
it has to rely blindly on the management and
the balance-sheet.
* * * *
These remarks are not directed against any
particular society, least of all against the
A.M.P. which this paper regards, from force
of habit and on no particular evidence, as by
far the best institution of its kind in Austra-
lasia—the Maoriland Government office alone
excepted. They are based on very little direct
evidence, for the rottenness of the insurance
system here lies in the almost complete want of
evidence. From the little it can gather, The
Bulletin believes that there are offices in this
country which an honest State audit would shut
up on the instant as insolvent, but the system
makes it impossible to prove this or anything
else. One thing is certain : the largest item in
the assets of all the Australian offices is loans
on mortgage, and considering the tremendous
fall that has taken place in land and brieks-and-
mortar this item can’t be quite so good as it
was. The excess of mortgage business has
arisen partly because the Governments have
persistently sold their securities in England,
and the Governments have done so portly
because the insurance offices here wouldn’t buy
reliable or 4 per cent, securities in the good
boom days, but rushed after a more precarious
business which yielded from 7 to 10 per cent.
Ihe insurance offices did this partly because
the public demanded big, sensational bonuses,
and high interest was necessary to pay them.
A periodical rigid State examination would at
least settle any doubt as to the soundness of the
mortgage business. Also, it would do a lot of
good to the sound societies by shutting up un-
sound ones and thereby lessening competition,
for which reason every sound office should
encourage the idea to the utmost.
The Wild-Cat Column,
At the Mildura inquiry last week Stephen Cure-
ton, one of the original founders and directors of the en-
terprise, climbed into the witness-box and told about the
most wildly-humorous story that the boom has yet pro-
duced. Cure ton, according 1 to his own evidence, first
came to Australia to get out of the way owing to a shoot-
ing difficulty, somebody in the land of the screaming eagle
having been too free with his gun. The Chaffeys, whom
Austiaha took to be great American capitalists, came out
with £lOO of their own, and money had to be borrowed
for their living-expenses. “ Our object,” said the cheerful
,s*"’ "; a y° set the public money.” He thought
that W. B. Chaffey should have known something about
irrigation, but George Chaffey knew very little. Con-
sidering- how Australia fell down and reverenced these two
lrrigationists on no evidence in particular, this allegation
is interesting. The extent to which the firm wanted to get
the public money appears in the fact that it at first
asked for 500,000 acres of land and £200,000 in cash.
. "’e got, say, 250,000 acres we meant to sell 50,000 and
re .^ a " lon S ourselves.” From this, which as
regalds the Chaffeys may or may not be true, it would
seem that the firm intended having a real good time at
the expense of the guileless Australian. Cureton put no
money into the concern-** In fact, I don’t believe any one
u h<3 Col \ lpa / V at all ”- but he annexed
m all AJSOO out of it, so the Canadian gentleman who
utn e „ ;° re 1° ie ,, ow t ! 11 , his shooting episode was over did
Weil enough on the whole. “We took in Mr. Levien ”
said Cureton; “we would have taken any one in—with
money.” J
t r^ hen went on to tell how they thought

decided that Deakin wasn t approachable. After he

scheme to foreign papers, and apparently blasted his ex-
partners prospects for a salary. An expert whom lie
induced an English paper to send out reported that the
works were a monument of mechanical ignorance and
wasteful folly.” Cureton, taking him all round, was are
Ss hT' HIS own vi ® w of the case, spoken can-
rr tuou t r b his nose, seemed to be practically that the
Chaffeys were not capitalists and not very brilliant irriga-
tiomsts; that his own object wasn’t to irrigate but to
take in a young and confiding country ; that he presumed
the other peoples object was much the same ; and that
he was surprised and saddened to find that the Gillies-
nfp ak l! abU ‘n t ! WaS ” * P re P ared to take a share in
the boodle and have a good time. Chiefly through this
beastly arid unexpected honesty he was in low curcum-
then Cureton, as a grieved Canadian in a
plug hat, retired from before the Board and was lost to
view, ana a good deal of the Australian’s reverence for
the foreign expert went with him

n,C,o fU,,d I “ c ,''. eased durin g: 1895 from £3,224,785 to
£3,2/0,442— an addition of £45,657. The net nrenmim
income for the year was £226,342, and interest on invest-
ments amounted to £128,022. The total management
expenses were only £22,634, equal to the exceedingly
sl ' la f obai'g'e of 10 per cent, on the premium income or
about 6g per cent, on total income. The annuity business
is kept separate, and the funds in this department in-
M £1,382,352, an expansion of
ald e eratl e on fo f new annuities granted
was £317,666, and interest on invested funds, £48,801 •
and. the total management expenses were onlv It npr
cent on receipts. Taking the life and annuity business
together, the expenses are less than 4 per cent, of the
receipts—bjr far . th . e iowest average among the life
offices doing business in Australasia. S
The most striking feature about the L.L and
G. Co., however, is the assets. Out of £9,708,000 only
about 1| millions is invested in mortgages, and less than
1£ millions in land and bricks and mortar. The balance
is in Government, municipal, and railway securities and
other assets whose value is easily ascertained. And the
auditors’ certificate is a comprehensive document such as
is rarely seen in Australasia. It sets forth distinctly that
‘‘ the present aggregate market-value of the securities is
in excess of the amount at which they stand in the balance-
sheet ”—which, as distinctly alleging that the funds
haven't gone into the abyss of “depreciation,” is the thing
above all others that the public wants to hear about. It
is also the thing above all others which the average auditor
passes by in solemn silence, merely saying, as a rule, that
the balance-sheet is correct “according to the books.”
If by any unimaginable possibility the L.L. and G. did
“ go bung” there would at least be somebody who could
be held responsible, which is a rather unusual circum-
stance in Australia.
* * * *
* Treas. Fysh, of Tasmania, advances a scheme
for an immediate and profitable conversion of the public
debts of Australasia, It is very simple, very beautiful,
and, save in one respect only, it is feasible enough. The
great demand in England just now is for long-dated secu-
rities ; everybody fears that interest may keep dropping,
hence the rush for even low-priced securities which are
fixed for a long term. A 3 per cent, stock with a long
date fetches a far higher price in proportion than a 4 per
cent, stock with a, short one. Therefore, Fysh proposes
that all the provinces of Australasia should offer to con-
,vert their miscellaneous stocks into a uniform 3 per cent,
liability fixed for 50 years certain, and thereafter redeem-
able at the option of the Government. Each holder of
the present stocks would get its market-value in the new
securities ; the holder of £lOOO in N.S.W. 4 per cents, due
1933 would receive £1220 in 3 per cents, instead ; the
owner of £lOOO in S.A. 4 per cents, due 1916 would receive
£ll6O in the new stock, and so on. On these terms it is
quite probable that the vast majority of the stock-holders
would convert. This arrangement, if successful, would
save the worry and expense of any more conversions for
half-a-century. It would add, most probably, about
£30,000,000 to the nominal debt. And in the meantime
it would save, on a rough estimate, about £700,000 a year
in interest Treasurer Fysh, who is a sanguine man, puts
the saving at over £1,000,000 a year.
Then comes the weak point of the scheme.
Fysh proposes that part of the amount thus saved should
be set apart as a sinking-fund to pay off the £30,000,000,
or whatever it may be, which the conversion process
would add to the principal of the debt. This is a brilliant
idea, provided that the sinking-fund could be chained up
where no Treasurer could possibly get at it, and the Trea-
surer and Legislature could be so securely fastened to
something that they couldn’t suspend the annual pay-
ments to the fund, or dodge them, as they do in Maori-
land, by borrowing the amount of the annual payment,
then it is sufficiently obvious that, by Fvsh’s conversion
process, the country might put, say, £400,000 a year'to
the sinking-fund, and he £300,000 a year better off in the
meantime, and the increase of the debt would be a gain
all lound instead of a loss. But where does Fysh propose
to put the sinking-fund so that it can’t be borrowed?
And how does he propose to fasten up the Treasurer and
the Legislature? The Bulletin knows of no place on
earth where an Australian sinking-fund could be placed
so that an Australian Government wouldn’t get at it, and
nothing smaller than Chimborazo that a Treasurer could
be chained to in order to keep him from breaking loose
and seizing that fund the first time he wants it

Things are complicated in Maoriland. The
Lower House—or, rather, the Govt, majority therein—has
appointed a committee that is almost wholly Ministerialist
to inquire into the B.N.Z. amalgamation business, and
presumably to decide through thick and thin that the
Government was strictly honest. The Council has ap-
pointed another and almost wholly Oppositionist com-
mittee to inquire into the same thing, and presumably to
decide, regardless of everything, that the Government
wasn t honest. And the President of the bank refuses to
give evidence before either of them, on the ground that
to publicly rip up the private affairs of the customers will
rum business. For this the Government has fined
the President £5OO. Result: deadlock, chaos, and general
howl of execration. Either the banking inquiry should
t V€ £i_ >een fudges of the Supreme Court, or
else there should have been no hanking inquiry at all.

The N.S.W. estimates of expenditure for the
new financial year are £9,620,508—ab0ut £400,000 more
than those for last year. This is the natural result of the
cash basis as applied to the public debt. Last year only
a half-year’s interest on a considerable part of the debt
was provided for, the other half being shunted on, but
this year the whole 12 months’ expenditure must he faced,
therefore the revenue for the present financial year needs
to be a lot better than that for the one just finished to
square the accounts.

Maoriland Public Trust Office presents a good,
solid argument in favor of compulsory State Fire Insur-
ance. It has £lBO,OOO worth of insurable property. The
average premiums paid are £1240 a year and the 'average
losses £415. With a private co. things pan out something
like this : Receipts from premiums, £1240 ; expenditure-
fire losses, £415 ; commission, travelling and other ex-
penses, office rents, &e., perhaps £5OO ; dividend to share-
holders and reserve fund, all the rest. Compulsory State
insurance would save the dividends, commissions, and a
great part of the salaries and office rents, and the State
would own the reserve-fund. That is where the differ-
ence comes in.
* * * *
The Vic. Ministry considerably weakened its
Companies Act by not insisting on a clause to the effect
that dividends should only be paid out of profits arisinf>-
from the ordinary business of the co. It proposed to
penalise a director who wilfully paid divs. out of what he
didn t know were profits, but after M’lntvre and Shiels
and others had darkened the subject with'much verbiage
the Govt, allowed the clause to read that no manager or
director should pay divs. out of what he knows are not
profits, which was the same thing turned learnedlv up-
side-down. Of course the manager or director who pays
are not earned will unanimously state that he
didn t know. And as it is hardly possible'for one man to
prove that another man knew something or hadn’t for-
gotten it, this will cover about everythin--. Why not
apply the same principle all round ? If a careless captain
runs his ship on the rocks, his certificate, by this kind of
logic, shouldn t be suspended unless it is proved that he
knew his ship was going on the rocks. The law insists on
the skipper and the engine-driver and the railway signal-
man knovymg their duties because they are paid for
knowing them—if they don’t know them and disaster

The Ion" section of S.A. transcontinental rail-
wav from flergott to Oodnadatta—the line where the
mixed train runs once a fortnight—costs £lO,OOO a year
for working-expenses and £45,000 a year for interest on
the borrowed money with which it was built. The total
receipts are under £6OOO, so the loss is £49,000 a year.
Now a British syndicate offers to complete the trans-
continental line if the State will guarantee 3% per cent,
interest on cost for 20 years, after which period it is to
buy the line. Herein the modesty of the syndicate is
conspicuous. The State can borrow the money itself at
3 per cent., and build the line and £et the profits if there
are any, while the other way it is to pay % per cent, more
if there is a loss, and if there are any profits the syndicate
gets them. Also, by the syndicate’s proposal the State
will have no control over the cost of the line ; if the syn-
dicate makes it twice as expensive as it need be, by paying
huge salaries to its brother Bill for supervision and so on,
the State would really find itself guaranteeing 7 per cent.
Which would be a truly beautiful situation for any State
to get * * *
“I know an institution,” said Johnny Isaacs
(Isaac A. Isaacs’ little brother) to Vic. Assembly, “in
which three-fourths of the total advances are loans to
directors at a less rate of interest than is being paid on
the money to the depositors.” Then Higgins amend-
ment on the Companies Bill, prohibiting any directors to
lend the money Of the institution to themselves, went
through suddenly and in silence. And not a director of
them all asked Isaacs for the name of the institution. Ihe
general tendency seemed to be to accept the amendment
without further comment, lest Johnny might be aggra-
vated into giving the name. For one glorious moment
Isaacs’ little brother was boss of the show, and the desire
not to irritate Johnny was the prevailing sentiment.

if there was there never will be again, so why waste legis-

The Vic. and N.S.W. Railway Commissioners
are about to take joint action for the suppression of the
ticket-dealers or “ scalpers.” At present, these gentry
make quite a little pile over Cook’s excursion-tickets.
Cook’s excursion leaves each capital one day a month,
when the return fares are £3 and £2 first and syoond-
class—but a passenger can return per ordinary train any
time within a month. The ticket-scalpers issue single
tickets by these trains at 355. and 225. 6d., which are
quickly bought by people going one way only, the other
halves of the tickets find a ready sale during the month
at £2 10s. and 355., as the ordinary single mterproyinoial
fare is £4 Is. and £3 os. Bd. Hence on every ticket that
passes through the dealers’ hands either £1 ss. or 17s. od.
is made, and fully 100 tickets go through these agents
each excursion. The difficulty in dealing with the intei -
provincial ticket-scalper so far has been that a Melbourne
ticket sold in Sydney, or vice-versa, is subject to the by-
laws of the province where it was issued—not where sola;
lence a local prosecution fails. The railway authorities
are getting over this ditficulty by some system of recipro-
city in regard to the issue of future tickets, so that
they will be as much one province’s as the other’s.

Melbourne stock-and-station agents have at
last unitedly put their feet down on what has been for

donations will be given to no shows outside of Melbourne.

Men and managers at Broken Hill snarl. The
union has been warning men in the Victorian mining dis-
tricts to keep clear of the Hill, asserting the existence of
a crowd of unemployed four or five hundred strong The
managers reply that miners are still wanted, and that the
men available'are not miners. The rejoinder is that the
men who are unemployed are largely practical miners
who are blackballed for three months for refusing to ac-
cept contract-work at the co.’s prices. But nothing in
the shape of striking is thought of, though the work of
rebuilding the unions is quietly but very slowly pro-
ceeding. „ , *

B H South is getting the reputation which was
once (in the bad old days) the possession of the Junction.
It has been on the of dividends the last 15 months,
but the shareholders have not yet got anything. Tiie
Bulletin has once or twice spoken of the mine as one of
the biggest lead properties now being worked; and so it
still is. But, at the best, there isn’t a big profit to be got
out of lead, especially when it occurs as sulphides ; much
more can be made out of the market when you knowhow.
And a few of the biggest shareholders in the South ought
to know how by this time. As printed a few weeks back,
it was the Adelaide people who wanted to sell (mostly
people who bought at big prices and hoped for divs., but
now see more money in Westralian stuff) while the Melb.
crowd—the aforesaid people who “ought to know
didn’t want to sell, having possibly a good thing on, divs.
or no divs. Meantime, the much-talked-about increase in
concentrate product has not taken place to any extent
worth talking about, simply because the additions to the
plant have been counterbalanced by the more compact
nature of the sulphides worked. The next thing will be
to increase the rock-breaking and crushing plant, in
which these works, like most of the others on the Hill,
are deficient. *
* *
The Burnham (English) syndicate’s offer to lease
the British B.H. Co.’s furnaces and buy its concentrate
output was, it now transpires, provisional,
doubts if the provision can be fulfilled. Atoo-mea o re
cable-message, which implied no conditions, appears to
be responsible for the Australian directors’announcement
made six weeks ago, „
At the middle of last quarter, when the B.H.
co’s started in earnest on their sulphides, it was promised
that profits would go on increasing as the men got used
to the work and as the machines were modified to the re-
nuirements. The promise, after 12 months, has been ful-
filled to only a small degree. Constant changes in the
nature of the ore (accompanied, of course, by the con-
tinued low prices of silver and lead) are the bugbear, and
must continue so while reliance has to be placed upon a
mechanical process. „ *

as anybody about the profits in sulphides. His mine,
Block 14, is equipped with a well-furnished concentrating
mill on the mine, and with roasting and smelting furnaces
at the seaboard, all connected by rail. In addition to its
sulphides, it produces regularly also a small quantity of
carbonates, for blending. Yet, though it puts through
the mill up to 3000 tons of sulphides per week, it can’t pay
a shilling div. every alternate month. Even the B.H.
Proprietary pays no div. this month.

The latest N.S.W. diamond - development-
“Nundle, Monday.—Owing to the recent receipt of a
cable from London re the recent discovery of diamonds
and zircons at Hanging Rock, some hundreds of acres
were pegged by miners and others on Saturday night and
Monday morning. Considerable excitement prevails.
Numbers of persons are arriving at Nundle and starting
for the field. Until reliable information is obtained as to
the value of the discovery, miners should not come here.”

Dear Bulletin, — Who was it wrote the very
exhaustive report on the splendid resources of the White
Rock silver-mine? And who was it that had the arrange-
ment of the machinery erected on it at tremendous cost
some years ago? No doubt the many small veins “are
expected” to merge into a great and rich central lode, but
I don’t recollect seeing any greater tendency that way
than to continue as they were. However, the “are
expected” is the spirit of mining, but I like to have it on
some solid-looking foundation. Let’s hope it will come
true. —N.W.

News that looks as if a W.A. correspondent had
settled on the field comes from Tumbarumba, N.S.W.
Some stone—tonnage unstated—has gone 50©z. to the ton,

to be one mass of gold, and there is in consequence very
great excitement.

The owner of a famous Australian mine was
once visited by an English “ mining expert,” who wanted
to see some of his gold. Some very fine colors were pointed
out. Then the haw-haw expert exclaimed, “That’s not
gold, my deah fellah; I’m a graduate of the London
School of Mines, and I ought to know. That is galena.”
Then Wilson, in the expert’s large ear : “ Maybe it isn’t.
But don’t give me away to those chaps down at the Mint,
for I’ve been selling this stuff to them as gold all along.”

That silver-scrip forgery was detected only
through the largeness of the parcel; had the forger
cut it up it would probably have passed from hand to
hand for a long time and not been sent to the office.
The counterfeit' was most convincing, and affords a
strong caution to those who handle “big” shares.

Clarke & Co., of Adelaide and Melbourne, have

News “There is a splendid supply of water here now

The so-far mild collapse in ihe W.A. market
boom is largely caused by the number of realisation orders
from London suddenly placed on Adelaide and Melbourne
markets. As a big buyer. Bull soon makes a boom, but
when he becomes a seller on the Australian market he
breaks it right up. He bought tens of thousands of
Bayley’s Rewards before awakening to the value of the
mine. He is not thoroughly awake yet, as he gives it a
market-value of t’loo,ooo. Nearly all the shares are held
in England and France. What price Bayley’s if the shares
were all held in Melbourne and Adelaide ?
* * * *
Perth: “ The assays from the reef at the New
Caledonia have returned 1340 z. to the ton.” The assay-
fiend lives and flourishes only on new mining camps. The
press is his chief accomplice, and often innocently helps
him to rob the public by deception. “ Assays, 1340 z.”
When will papers see the folly of the whole
thing? If such a statement appeared in a Charters
Towers or Bendigo paper, it would be laughed at, and
people would assume that a new city editor was on the
job. The dense mining ignorance of the big Australian
dailies is an appalling circumstance.
After a long rest comes the news that some
more gold has been found quite near the great “ Wealth
of Expectations ” mine, W.A. “It is thickly impregnated
with galena, and, after putting in a shot, gold could be
seen with the naked eye.” But why this long-continued
silence about the marvellous mine itself ? The good old
Plunderderry, too, had a crushing some weeks ago, and
not a word was wired over about it ; 85 tons for some
50oz. Why, too, are not the weekly returns of all the
batteries around Coolgardie published now that there s
plenty of water to keep them running?
At last a good crushing on the Murchison.
Mainland Consols, 275 tons for 12760 z. Good enough for
anything if it can be kept up, say, once a month.
Of course, Alick Forrest has been banqueted in
London. He promised that no one who had been lucky
enough to get into the Forrest Exploration Co. would ever
reo-ret it, and that he will be able to give a good account
of the enterprise within a year. Zeh. ■ Lane was there.
His speech was characterised by its extreme modesty :
“ When he (Zeb.) and others went to explore, they followed
the track of the Forrests and then found tne gold, and
there was no doubt whatever that W.A., assisted by such
men as the Forrests, would certainly be the biggest gold-
producing country in the world.” *
A great many persons who were induced to buy
Croesus Extended shares, in anticipation of the sale of
the mine, are now amazed and enraged to find that the
cash is only sufficient for a humble “ bob ” dividend. An
investigation of the whole business is demanded by those
who bought shares up to 7s. and Bs. each.

Characteristic letter received by Bulletin from
one of the Coolgardie fields (written by a man who signs

stand in half the money got for the consideration of the pro-
perty and paid-up shares. There is a reef on this property

Which is much better than the average and good enough

before it had a railway. Yet the difference in the two
places is inappreciable.

Latest W.A. sensation—2ooooz. dollied in half-

if one mine can turn out2ooooz. in half-an-hour the whole

Good old wire liar ! But the 2000 oz. yarn has gone ahead

In W.A. more gold is produced by lying than crushing.
A smart Jewish youth returned to Australia
the other day as private sec. to a YVestralian gold-

plover, who caught him in the wild state, as it were,
didn’t think very much of him until he happened to take
him (or be taken by him) to a London evening-party (at a
rabbi’s house) consisting mostly of South African Hebrews,
who naturally sneered at the alleged gold-resources of
Westralia. The discussion at length grew acrimonious.
“ Look here,” said one of the South African gang, your
place may be all very well for a conscienceless gamble, hut
none of our race will join with you in believing in it as a
field for real investment.” “No, perhaps not, said the
ex-scribe, “the Jews are an unbelieving lot—tney
wouldn’t even believe in Christ.” And this at a rabbis
evening-party! t t

good reasons, viz., that they can only pay divs. (if any) on

The revival of mining in Victoria has produced
as one result an increased interest in the lore of water-
rights, races, flumings, and other such skeletons of
deserted diggings. In the N.E. district, it is said, several
parties of miners have taken possession of separate sec-
tions of a long water-race seemingly ownerless hitherto,
with the result of awaking sundry local Councils, mining-
boards, defunct co.’s and the like up to the * legal advice
point. So that the ordinary dry pages of the mining law
are likely to be illustrated with “ riparian rights, the
law of waters,” “servitudes,” and “mills on the 1 loss

Towers tailings run from 4dwts. to Sdwts. per

The sort of thing which “cruels” mining. At
a meeting of Mt. Lyell Minerals Co. it was proposed to
issue 100,000 shares of £1 to shareholders and sell 100,000
to London at 10s., thus ticketing the mine as worth
£150,000 ; and Mr. G. A. Lawson thought that by send
ing the shares to London at 10s. they depreciated the
wain anf thpir nroDertv.” !! ! Dr* Fulton tb&t tbo
leases should- be prospected by costeenin# before being
placed on the London market. They did not know what
tliere was there yet; at present there was nothing dis-
covered, hut it might prove to be the very valuable
property they expected it to be.” Both gentlemen
were elected directors. The Argus report winds up
humorously : “ A protracted meeting was brought to a
conclusion by an ex-director selling a share (200th) foi
£35 to a new director.” After all the light raillery and
airv persiflage of a “protracted meeting, two persons,
who ought to know the present value of the unexplored
blocks, assessed the mine’s value at £7OOO, and they are
going to try and persuade the sleepy British public to
pay them £50,000 CASH for half the Mount Lyell Minerals
Co. ! ....
Dr. E. D. Peters’ estimate of Mount Lyell ore,
lath May, ’93 :—Copper, 41 per cent. ; silver, 3oz. ; gold,
2idwts. Metallurgist R. Sticht’s actual smelting returns,
oil 15th July, ’96 Copper, 41? per cent. ; silver, 3foz. ,
gold, 2dwt. St. Peters the prophet!
Though Mt. Lyell’s pyritic smelting appears to
he a dead cert, the bullion value of the 420 tons treated
by one smelter, and trotted out as reliable data
scrippers to figure-wrestle with, somehow fails to fill the
sneculative eye. It is whispered from the field that the
yield is from poor-grade ore, and that something bettei
wasshownby the initial 14-day smelting reputedly on
™nd average ore. During the latter run the smelter,
going at about half-speed, must have treated over 1000
tonsfand with such a mass of stuff put through it sounds
peculiar to hear it officially yelled that, being ot
a preliminary character,” the run did not afford rehab e
( } a t, a ” —and, therefore, the returns are withheld from
shareholders. In the absence of the metallurgists detail
figures the exact profit on the 420 tons ore cannot be got
at, but rough estimates tot it up at well over £T a ton.
Feelers are being put out suggesting monthly clean-ups,
but shareholders are starting to buck for weekly returns
—the proper thing, of course.
Apropos : a very powerful and well-informed
crowd are cheerful in the belief that they will pull the
stock back to £3 10s.
Broker “Billy” Jones scored on his six months’
option over a Lyell director’s 5000 shares at £6 each ! He
halved with “ Saide” Millar for £lsoo—option only cost
him £looo—and when the stock rose to £9 he closed the
deal and let the Britishers have his 2500 to play with.
The director’s profit was worth handling, seeing he got
his scrip for a song.
A goodly slice of Age gilt is in Mt. Lyell.
Nephew Joe planked a lot of uncle David’s purchase-
money into the big mine, and he was rewarded with a
directorship.
In a month the market-value of Mt. Lyell had
slumped nearly a million. Taking in the “ pups,” one big
scripper’s interest dropped £40,000 last week. Big
figures!
The one really brilliant feat of the Mt. Lyell
board was the late issue of shares to tempt debenture-
holders to surrender their debentures for the scrip-
equivalent. They were tempted, and not more than half-
a-dozen debentures are now afloat. Co. thus relieved of a
heavy liability in one swoop.
Tas. people hold about 50,000 Mt. Lyells; Vic.
(with a few in the other provinces), 80,000 ; and the Bri-
tishers, close on 62,000.
Metallurgist Sticht tossed his hat in the air
when the assay of the slag showed him the smelting was
all serene. He has much coin in the Mount.
Extract from an aged American cable to the
Mt. Lyell board : “ Dr. Peters has had no experience with
the latest methods of copper reduction.” Peters based
his calculations on the roasting process,, not nearly so
effective or as economical as Sticht’s method.
A strong section of the Mount Lyell coterie is
horribly “narked” over Jacks, M.P., joining the South
Mt. Lyell’s London board, which includes Gus. Imroth, of
the inner South African capitalistic ring. Jacks was
originally on Mt. Lyell’s oversea board, but cut the con-
nection with the crowd over the debenture-issue business.
To see Jacks in with a rival co. is gall and wormwood to
the Mt. Lyellites in question, some of whom never lose an
opportunity of abusing him in terms that might draw
blood if stated in cold type.
* * * *
Most people buy into mines to sell out on the
first return, with the idea that at that time the shares
will be at the top of the market. Few hold off to buy at
this particular time, and the necessity of buyers is never
thought of. Mt. Lyell stock fell heavily after the
first return. The success of the new smelting process, on
which all hung, seems to have been established, the ore
is running right up to official anticipations, and in face of
all this stock came down like a load of bricks for the
aforesaid reasons. Moral: If you buy to sell, or cant
hold, be sure and sell before the first crushing. Good is
is the Mt. Lyell return, it is much below what papers have
worked the public to anticipate, and 99 times in 100
anticipations are bigger than realisations.

An effort is to be made to amalgamate the
Volunteer, West Volunteer, and one or two other mines
adjoining at Lefroy (Tas.). Much money might have
been saved had this been done three years ago. Better
late than never.
* * * *
As an illustration of the size and character of
the present boom, it is worth noting that a leading firm
of Melb. brokers had 100 Tasmanian mining “ properties”
offered to them for flotation last month, and 98 per cent,
of the good things were not reckoned good enough to
deal with.
In a scheme of arrangement made by an Eng-
lish co. with its creditors, provision was made for a call
on shareholders for stiff amounts extending over periods,
power being given to liquidator to accept payment of
whole amount at a discount at any time. A dispute
arose as to whether “discount” meant true discount in
tne sense of the ascertainment of the capital value at the
time of payment of a sum payable at a future date, or
“ commercial discount ” in the sense of a rebate of in-
terest on the amount. A rather fine judgment of
Vaughan Williams, who based his decision in favor of the
true discount theory on the principle of treating all
shareholders as on ah equality, was reversed by the Court
of Appeal, which held that the “ scheme ” being a “ com-
mercial ” document, the term “ discount ” must be taken
to mean “ commercial discount.” A distinct score for
oily Dives.
If it is true, as cabled, that a goldfield likely to
rival the Rand has been found in the Orange Free State,
the Boers and their next-door neighbours will probably
soon be engaged in a death-grip with Bull, for whose sole
use and benefit the Almighty unquestionably made the
earth and all that is therein and thereunder.

Some of the life co’s are pursuing a catchpenny
policy in their canvassing. The regular canvassers are
played out—everyone has “other business” when those
gentry appear. So the societies are “laying for the out-
of-work bank-clerks and civil servants. To draw these,
nearlv every ad. for a canvasser has a clause “ previous
experience not necessary.” The C.S. has always a large
circle of acquaintances, and the co’s argue that many of
these will throw a “coin” in the poor devil’s way in
memory of old times. So he is instructed to work among
his pals, and when results begin to tail off, the manager
know-s that his friends “ know him no more ” and he gets
the sack, and another man is taken on, to infinity.

More-or-less democratic London County Council
has emphatically rejected a motion for the establishment
of municipal pawnshops. A mere instance of arrested
development. A national or municipal bank which ad-
vances on the security of houses and land must in every
country include an establishment where the hand-to-
mouth worker will be able, under equal State protection,
to obtain an advance on his humble personal possessions.
What ails the London Council is that it has tried to begin
at the lowest end. Had it begun with a municipal bank,
or w-ith bank and pawnshop simultaneously, vision would
have been clearer.

It is recorded that an exceedingly wealthy

Ex-attorney Meagher threatens further
revelations ” in connection with the Dean case.
“HE KNEW HERN
“I hear Mrs. Blankity Blank's husband has been eaten by a tiyer.”
“ Hum! Well, now, that was not much of a change for poor Blank. ”
Can these be the same revelations which Attorney-
General Want assured N.S.W. Parliament were
volunteered to him during the conspiracy-trial ?
Had these tardy revelations been given then, they
would have been called by the better-known name
of “ Queen’s evidence.” There have been so many
revelations up to now in the case that a new version
of a twice-told tale would not cause a thrill even
to a novel-reading maiden of lfi. Too late now for
revelations which must give the lie to one or other
of the many previous versions of this remarkable
affair.

“ Some of -the most humorous institutions
at present conducted in Australasia ” (writes a
Bulletin correspondent) “are among the ‘private
hospitals and nursing homes,’ and the time has
fully arrived for bringing these places within the
sphere of Governmental inspection through the
central Board of Health. 1 hear on undoubted
authority of one down-North institution the fees
of which are stupendous f r mere board and
lodgings and nursing- medical charges, of course,
all being extra —where the nurses are very fre-
quently (and not as a matter of special emergency)
on duty from 8 o’clock to 4 p.m. next day, with a
Sunday off once a fortnight. Those nurses pray
doubtless —‘Give us this - day our daily death,’
because with a vacant bed there is at least
a temporary surcease of duty. The nurses
when off duty are entitled to sleep if they
can get a bed. Some nurses have turned in
to beds just vacated by patients more or less
cured, or by corpses. Regular beds, much less
bed-rooms, they have not. One nurse the night
of her admission, and for a fortnight or three
weeks afterwards, was quietly accommodated with
a shake-down under an ambulance-stretcher in a
passage-way, and on remonstrating was politely
told by the matron that space was too valuable to
devote to nurses’ bed-rooms. ‘ Rents are so high,
my dear, you see ! ’ ”
* * * *
When it was publicly stated that the nurses
in Melb. hospital work 12 hours a day —and very
often 15 or lfi hours—the hospital trustees gave
the statement a loftily scornful denial, and said
that they (the nurses) worked, on an average, not
more than 8|- hours a day. The public took the
trustees’ assurance, and was, after its burst of
virtuous indignation, about to settle itself to sleep
again, when a traitor in the hospital camp wrote
to the papers, stating that the 81 hours average
was ingeniously arrived at by counting in as
working time the nurses’ Sundays off duty, and
their annual fortnight’s holidays !

Dr. Leith Napier, the newly-appointed
Medical Supt. of Adelaide Hospital, will probably
have a hot time at the hands of the local medical
ring. One leading medico recently called him a
“ cur,” and at various times he has been described
as “a medical blackleg ” and a “ traitor.” Strange
to say, the Tory press, instead of upholding
Napier as a noble example of “medical freedom of
contract,” has merely re-echoed these sentiments.
Adelaide Hospital honorary doctors, who struck
because Kingston would not dismiss nurse Graham,
have lately been treating patients (who would
ordinarily have gone to the Hospital) at private
hospitals for nothing and paying for their board
in addition,' rather than let the cases go to the
Hospital. Premier Kingston is delighted at this
arrangement, which means a great saving to the
taxpayer!

Melb. girls wonder why the warbling Earl
has so suddenly gone into country seclusion.
Melbourne authoriti es are
trying to take a larr ikin census.
The Commissioner of Police
has called on his subordinates
for information about “the
push ” in their respective
neighborhoods the distin-
guishing name of the push, its
characteristics (including, pre-
sumably, its particular method
of stoushing), how long it has
existed, how it came to be
formed, the number, names,
ages, and occupations of its
members. Unfortunately, the
prosaic constable isn’t the right
man to deal with such a pic-
turesque subject. If a Zola-
esque observer were put on tire
job what a'blue-book he might
produce about the ways and
aspirations of the crowd that
spits on the pavement and
incidentally calls on Provid
ence to strike it blind —its edu
cation, clothes, ambitions, i
“Moll,’’its feuds with adjacen-
pushes, its geographical limits,
its literary and dramatic tastes,
its emotions, its wonderful
boots, its sources of revenue, its
internal discipline, where it
comes from when it is young,
where it goes to when it grows
old, the legends of defunct
pushes and the signs of new
ones springing up, whether the
push is hereditary, the occa-
sional solitary larrikin as' dis-
tinguished from the gregarious
one, and many other matters.
The most distinctively Aus-
tralian volume on record would
be the one which gave a bright,
intelligent and accurate history
of the push.

Miss Buxton, daughter of £,A. Governor
XXX Buxton, is to be married this week to a
certain Rev. B. Hawker. The last vice-regal
marriage which took place in Australia was dis-
figured by a fearsome row about payment for
certain gravel allegedly ordered by the bridegroom
to be strewn upon a road on the way to church.
The merits of the shindy are quite incomprehen-
sible to outsiders, but it is known that the row
was about unpaid-for gravel. If there is any
uproar about gravel this time it is to be hoped it
will come off privately.
* * * *
Lady Clarke has said there is no need for
a reduction of the hours of the Melb. hospital-
nurses, as the nurses have not agitated for it. A
nurse who tried to agitate for anything, especially
in the Women’s Hospital—which is managed by
fashionable women who pose as benevolent—would
soon lose her position. The fact is that these
nurses are scandalously overworked—and the wail
of the hospital-managers, that if Premier Turner
insists on a reduction of hours so many more
nurses will have to be employed, only affords ad-
ditional proof of the fact. The benevolent dames
urge (1) that the nurses are not overworked ; and
(2) that, if fair limitation of hours is insisted on,
very many more nurses will have to be employed.
The arguments answer each other; they cannot
both be true.
* * * *
Melb. medicos are cutting into the friendly
societies by means of medical clubs. Various
doctors throughout the suburbs have canvassers
out soliciting members, entrance fee, Is. ; pay-
ments, (id. weekly afterwards. This covers medi-
cal attendance on and medicine for each member,
his wife and family (no limit to latter). The
navvy at ss. a day and the man getting £') weekly
are alike accepted, and if special attendance is
wanted, £2 2s. yearly covers everything. This
sort of thing is calculated to swell the death-rate
considerably ; no doctor can be expected to take a
serious interest in a case, or do anything save
throw in the cheapest drugs promiscuously, at fid.
a week. Also, it is calculated to make the shoddy
medico multiply exceedingly. How much pro-
found scientific knowledge can be expected for
fid. a week, less the canvasser’s commission ? When
a doctor lives on 300 sixpenny patients, all of
whom call him in on every possible occasion to
get value for their sixpence, he will simply take a
telescopic view of the crowd, as certain Sydney
doctors were reputed to do of the patients on the
Faraway in the smallpox-scare days. In these
times, itisalleged, theinvalids who were being burnt
up by the most raging of fevers came on deck naked
early in the bleak morning, and the doctor lay off
in a boat and looked at their spots through a field-
glass, and yelled to them that they were coming
on nicely but must be careful to avoid a chill.
Then they went below and died. The sixpenny
dodge is very like that.

Melb. Town Hall was crammed, and hun-
dreds of raging religious persons fought furiously
around the doors striving to get in, when the
Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Association held its
anniversary the other day. The speakers on the
occasion held forth eloquently, earnestly, patheti-
cally on the charitable work done by the Associa-
tion, mentioning the number of meals given to
the hungry, and of beds to the homeless, and
winding up with an appeal to the audience for
contributions to help the good work along. The
result was that from all that vast concourse the
sum of o£Bl 7s. 3d. was collected. From which it
Would appear that the old shellback parsons,
who think that the new movement is taking money
out of the collection-plates, have not so much to
be jealous about, after all.

One of the institutions of Sydney is the
“Drunks’ Train ” —the midnight train for Parra-
matta on Saturday night. All the Saturday night
drunks who live in the railway suburbs take a zig-
zag course for this train, and are helped in by
their friends, or the railway officials, or by other
drunks. Then the porters bang the doors care-
fully, for at nearly every door some excited person
has his head in the road, and the heaving mass
of beer and song and blasphemy rolls away into
the darkness, with its feet in its hat, and its collar
burst, and the ash from its pipe getting into its

eye. Most of the inmates are regular passengers,
and when the sleeping drunks reach their respec-
tive stations they are generally identified, unless
they are unrecognisable through mud, and dragged
out by the guard or by the hand of Provi-
dence. The strange or unknown drunk goes right
on to Parramatta, and is thrown out there because
the train goes no further, and hangs over a rail
till morning trying to identify himself. Parra-
matta is a more interesting place at 2 a.m. on
Sunday than at any other time, owing to the
inebriated strangers from down the line fore-
gathering outside the railway-station and lighting
matches to try and find out their own names and
addresses, and endeavouring to undress under
trees. A few hours later, about daybreak, a sad-
dened procession discovers its whereabouts by
reading the board at the railway-station, and starts
for home in various ways more or less circuitous
and wobblesome, and those who are left behind
ascertain their names by finding them on the
charge-sheet on Monday morning.

Some Chow fan-tanners, who put their
defence into the' hands of Premier Turner’s firm,
caught it hot at Melb. Police-court, the other day.
Ah Sin and Co. had been told by some Little
Bourke-street authority that the Crown wouldn't
think of pushing a case hard against the clients of
Lyons and Turner, so when a =£loo fine, &c., was
registered the astounded heathens poured out a
volume of Chinese language which nearly made
the interpreter turn black.

Nearly all the Townsville publicans employ
Chinese, Javanese or other colored men as cooks,
and this has set a movement afoot to socialise a
public-house and employ only Europeans to cook
for and sell grog to Europeans. In several Char-

for the especial use of Chinese customers.

The story goes that a Chinaman lately
worked a free first-class railway passage from
Lawrence to Dunedin (M.L.), including refresh-
ments at all the best places on the way down, by
simply remarking “Me leper” when requested to
pay up. It was only when he reached Dunedin
that a new-chum from Kilkenny ventured to catch
hold of him, and pulled away an arm and part of
the shoulder.

A very ugly move is being worked by the
Selborne chamber barristers in Melbourne, helped
by the old and “ respectable ” firms of solicitors.
They fear the effect of the newly-organised
“ amalgam ” ring, and propose to have a Bill in-
troduced into Parliament, and, with the help of
the numerous lawyers there, engineered quickly
through, the effect of which will be to abolish the
amalgamation principle before anyone is aware of
what is being done. The public don’t know yet
whether amalgamation is any good, but the very
fact that the lawyers hate it like poison is fair
prima facie evidence of its utility.

The newly-formed Vic. Barristers and
Solicitors’ Association is allegedly intended to
further the aims of the Legislature' in amalgamat-

to checkmate the designs of the old bar’ and
solicitors against the gentle client world. One of
the principal -members of this new philanthropic
society is Matthew Davies.

The N.S.W. Orangemen are trying to
revive the ancient Anglican Primate v. R.O.
Cardinal Government-House-precedence question.
The whole thing was settled long ago on the more
or less common-sense basis that whichever of the
two dignitaries happened to be of the longer local
standing should take the pas. But, thank Heaven,
there is in Australia no State church, and as
theoretically all religions are officially equal here
there really can be-no reason why the Rabbi, or
the Wesleyan representative, or the head of the
fire-worshippers, or the Salvation Army, if he
happens to be the senior local boss-ecelesiastic,
should not head the procession and sit on the
Governor’s extreme right. Why should the Angli-
can and the R.C. faiths alone be considered in this
matter ?

A baleful glimmer was shed on the still-

turned up at a recent very high-toned Sydney
Spiritualistic seance. He, or it, claimed to have

and, in reply to interrogations, stated that he was
a member of the ill-fated Lamont Young’s boat’s
crew. He said the whole party were shot by an
individual who still resided in the district, and
that the bodies were buried in the sand close to
where the stranded boat was found. If that .£lOOO
reward is still hung up, and the common or table
sort of spook was not such a gifted liar, there
should be a rich beach claim somewhere in the
vicinity of the spot indicated.

Sydney Benevolent Society paid in June
last on behalf of its ordinary batch of destitutes
more to landlords than to bakers, and nearly half
as much to landlords as to all other purveyors
taken together. Happy landlords ! Economists
who hold that rent should never exceed one-eighth
of income even in prosperous times should note
that pauperised Sydney pays its landlords nearly
half of all the takings of the eleemosynary hat.

The mysterious disappearance from Sydney
of Armand Jerome recalls the escape of a well-
known bank-defaulter a few years ago. He took
into his confidence a cabby who was under obhga-
gations to him, paid cabby well, find lived for nine
months in his house; allowed his beard to grow
full, dyed it red, and, when the scent was cold,
shipped for South America.

A mysterious agency seems to be at work
with certain Melb. women who are--well, say,
inclined to emhonnoint. Lady X. and Lady Z.
are visibly losing their circumference in a manner
which has puzzled the average male, for even
excessive bicycling would not account for the rapid,
change. At a recent swell function the secret that
they were all under a new treatment leaked out.
The Education Minister having given notice
of the withdrawal from the N.S.W. Art Society
of the £5OO a year subsidy it has hitherto enjoyed,
and announced that art-classes are to be estab-
lished at the enlarged National Gallery, under
departmental supervision, there is much specula-
tion in artistic circles as to who the instructor is to
be. The capable Mr. Gordon Coutts, who has just
been appointed art-instructor to the Art Society,
conies from Melbourne only to find that the funds
reckoned on for his salary have vanished into thin
air. _ *

The Cook blacks the other day murdered
a squatter and plundered the stores. Mistaking
arsenic for baking-powder, they mixed the poison
with flour, and.when the police arrived they found
no fewer than 14 corpses scattered over the coun-
try. The troopers did not cut any fresh notches
in the carbine-stocks this time.
The Man from Australia.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The man standing on the pavement of
a busy London street had “ Australia ”
stamped alt over him—in his grizzled
hair, his deep-set eyes, his tanned face and
frame. Bow he got there is, maybe, a
long story, but he had, at last, come to
the end of his resources a,nd was penniless.
He was staring into a chemist's window, and at last he walked in.
“ I want yon to do me a favor," he said to the small, thm, bald-headed pro-
prietor behind the counter.
“I regret began the chemist, politely.
“ Oh, it isn’t money," said the man-, “it isn’t money. Bat, you see, Im
from Australia!"
“ Well ? ” 7.77/ ni
“ Well, I’m homesick, so I dropped in to ask you to let me have a smell at

The large corpse of Albert Norman cum-
bers the stage of Sydney Royal this week, while
Cosgrove looks through the window with a horror-
stricken yellow eye at the results of his evil deed.
Last time “A Woman’s Revenge” was staged in
Sydney the corpse on the floor was Cosgrove and
the baleful eye at the window, that looked like a
lamp on a wreck, was Baker’s ; also, whereas for-
merly Baker helped to clean out Sass and wreck
his happiness'and drive away his wife and child,
now Baker is the hero, and is ruined and laid
waste by Norman. Another change is that the
hangman’s rope, which was solemnly greased by
Baker for the fair white neck of Henrietta Wat-
son, is now greased in a rather less efficient man-
ner by Cosgrove for Henrietta’s sister Elizabeth.
The general result, however, is about as good as
before. “A Woman’s Revenge” is a rather
ordinary drama with a great moral in it, the
said moral being that it is bad policy for
the two villains to begin quarrelling about
the plunder. Up to the point where these
two men in tall black hats and long black coats
commence disembowelling each other over the
takings, things go well enough with them. But
when the corpse of Norman is left one wet night
in the house of Baker’s wronged wife; and Cos-
grove begins to gibber as h 3 walks, and whisper to
himself, and see the bloodstained hat of his victim
running after him, and he meets his deceased
accomplice unexpectedly at street corners, and he
commences to grab at imaginary things floating in
the air, it is obvious that the complication is going
to be cleared up. The trouble hitherto has been
that the misunderstood people won’t meet and
explain things to each other, but a lady who has
had a dead body left in her house can’t keep her
address secret any longer, and a lawyer with a
mangled remains on his mind must gibber
foolishly to somebody and thereby cast light on
the mystery
* * * *
There are two big sensations in the drama
—one when the remains of Norman are unlawfully
left on the premises, and the other when Miss
Watson is tried on a charge of gunning that un-
principled man to his doom. The present Miss
Watson, in the latter scene, is, on the whole, a
failure. She wriggles too painfully in the dock,
and the plain black frock of the wronged and
despairing female—the despairing female never
wears a collar or cuffs—looks unkempt and objec-
tionable. Only the upper part of the heroine is
visible above the dock, but her aspect seems to
suggest that she has holes in her stockings and that
her shoes are trodden down at heel. The Bulle-
tin hereby urges the wronged heroine to brace up
and wear a collar in the dock. Cosgrove, who is
manifestly improving all round, is a better wicked
attorney than this paper expected, but it is obvious
that Baker should have had the part. Miss
Frances Ross plays with more energy than she
used to do, and is a wholly satisfactory adven-
turess in beautiful clothes and adorned with a
dazzling smile ; and little Brightie Smith does
Baker’s daughter with great success. The only
objection to this very small actress is her stage-
name—there is nothing poetic about B. Smith.
Mr. and Mrs. Holt, Brown, and Norman make up
the rest of the show, and the public seems satisfied
with all of them. There is nothing very unusual
about the “ Woman’s Revenge”; it sticks to the
safe old lines of the wronged woman in a cottage,
and the bad man who wants her to elope with him,
and the other recognised props and circumstances.
But it seems to fill a large want somewhere, judg-
ing by the business, which is even larger than
Norman’s dead body on the floor.

The large “musical trifle” at Sydney
Lyceum is now in its fourth week, and the infinite
variety of Bessie Clayton’s back kick has not
faded in the least. Lawton’s amazing whistle,
too, shows no signs of decadence, though The
Bulletin firmly believed that he would ere this
have blown his “innards” right into the orchestra,
and the limbs of the widow, when she has her
short frock on, have not palled on the bald-headed
man’s opera-glass. Nothing is yet reported as to a
change of programme, so presumably any such
event is still a long way off.

The present is absolutely the last week of
Charles Godfrey at Sydney Tivoli, and when he is
gone the city will presumably have to fall back on
Crackles a little more than heretofore by way of
consolation. Crackles isn’t a bad person to fall
back upon either. Godfrey’s benefit was fixed for
Wednesday, and that great occasion was to intro-
duce one Sally Holmes, said to be a whistler of
renown. The Frantz Family of acrobats is to
appear at the Tivoli shortly, to assist in filling the
gap caused by Godfrey’s departure and to help
Crackles in sustaining the heat and burden of the
day.

Last week the curse which has hung so
long and heavily over Her Majesty’s (Sydney) got
into good working order and started on a career of
devastation. On the morning of his benefit
Manager Woods was arrested for contempt of
court or something—he had been so busy fixing up
the scenery that he didn’t appear to answer some-
body s demand for arrears of wages, and the court
got its hair off in consequence. As a result of this
unexpected incident Woods had to get out on bail
to attend his own benefit, which was quite an un-
usual experience. The bench finally let him off
arrest; probably it had tried to fix up scenery
itself some time or other, and realised that a man
with such a thing as that on his mind couldn’t
be expected to remember anything else. Then
Woods was re-arrested, at the instance of sundry
other people who wanted their wages, before he
had time to get round the next corner. After that
u y orr ‘ ec * manager got away and filed his
schedule, and was arrested again for an alleged
breach of the Bankruplsy Act, and at time of
writing - he was again out on bail and probably ex-
pecting to be arrested some more. So far Woods’
partner doesn’t seem to have been arrested at all;
and the enthusiastic manner in which the creditors
all rallied round Woods as soon as the partnership
expired is a touching evidence of friendship. The
fact that the firm played for three months with a
bailiff continuously on the premises is an evidence
of pluck that deserved to have panned out better.

The Brough Co. has done excellent busi-
ness at Brisbane Opera House. “ The Passport ”
went up for the first time on Saturday. The
season closes on the 25th, the co. opening at Rock-
hampton on the 27th. All seats for the whole
season of one week in that town have been booked
three weeks in advance—a record for the city of
sin, sweat, and sorrow. A three-night season may
eventuate there on the return trip. Charters
Towers, with the reputation of being the best
show-town in Queensland, ought to produce the
record treasury for the co. this trip. Brisbane also
gets a short return season.
The Potter-Bellew season at Melbourne
Princess’s was to end with a mixed bill on Wednes-
day, and to-night (Thursday) the theatre will
be closed for rehearsal of “ A Gilded Fool,” unless
something happens to alter arrangements made at
time of writing. Three nights of “ Trilby ” were
to have come between the departure of the twin
stars aforesaid and the production of the new
arrivals from America, but, owing to an outbreak
of irreligious mania for “Trilby” in Adelaide,
that partially naked young person stayed there
two days over contract time, and will make only
one last consecutive appearance at the Princess’s,
to-morrow (Friday), previous to sailing for Maori-
land. By the way, the Land of the Moa is ex-
pected to take very kindly to “ Trilby,” inasmuch
as public opinion there was antagonistic to Prof.
Kennedy, and ought therefore to derive special
gratification from Svengali’s corpse.
* * * *
The Australian debftt of Nat Goodwin and
company in “A Gilded Fool” is fixed for Satur-
day khe Princess’s. The importation of
Mr. Goodwin and a full co., to play comedies
written by Americans for Americans, is un-
doubtedly the most un-English experiment ever
ventured by the firm, on which account The Bul-
letin wishes it all the good luck that such a bold
new enterprise deserves. The leading man brings
a very great name from his own country, and he has
come here at a comparatively early period of his
career, instead of waiting till the back of his
humor is bent with age.
* -X * *
; There is nothing fresh to remark of the
Trilby ’ burlesque, at the Royal, except that
Svengah s nose is an uncertain quantity. Some
nights the soiled genius makes a larger demonstra-
tion of Hebraic boko than on others, although the
rest of his personality remains always the same as
usual. Also the question whether Maggie Moore’s
show is a travestie mingled with pantomime, or a
pantomime supported by travestie, is not less open
to dispute than before. It still crowds the house
and will go on repeating the offence until July 3l!
A farewell benefit to M.M. is announced for
the 30th mat. One or two of the lady’s previous
farewells were false starts, so to speak, but the
absolute genuineness of this next benefit can be
guaranteed.
** * *
Fun on the Bristol seems to get along
cheerfully enough at Melb. Bijou, in spite of an
undue tendency to sentimental ballads and a
rather weakening change in the cast. On Satur-
day there was a new and unimpressive Count in
place of the tall, Family HEKALn-looking figure
who pursued Widow O’Brien at the outset, and
although the first nobleman was not indispensable
his successor’s sudden disappearance would be
more gladly received. One great point about the
present Widovv and her daughters is the wondrous
splendor of their millinery. As far as one
can -.,rJ ud g;e through opera-glasses, the quality
of Mrs. O Brien s satin exceeds anything hitherto
accomplished by Mrs. Potter. Moreover, the
underclothing of the Irish she-male has such a
great private reputation that it might as well be
washed every evening in the second act, and hung
across the stage to dry. A chance to witness a
number of lace-edged etceteras displayed on a
clothes-line would—for some reason which The
Bulletin feels quite unable to explain—probably
excite a rush for the early door. Under present
conditions the Bijou depends considerably upon
Miss Luella s tights, and “ Fun on the Bristol ” is
likely to last another week.

Charles Godfrey returns to Melbourne
Opera House on Saturday as a consolation for the
loss of the Frantz Family, and several other recent
arrivals will stay to assist Charles in softening this
blow. Meantime a distressed community draws
some comfort from the Food and Health Show at
the Exhibition Building, where the solemnity of
cooking competitions is relieved by theatrical per-
formances, concerts, bicycle quadrilles, and other
giddiness.

There are said to be 80,000 barmaids in
London, most of whom are tempted from virtue
by gaudy presents, flattering tongues, or strong
drink especially drink. The “ square ” barmaids
are almost invariably teetotallers.
It is coming gradually. In suspending
from practice for 12 months an attorney who had
appropriated his client’s money, Vic. Judge
A Beckett mentioned the frequency with which
these applications had come before the court of late,
and thought that instead of a month’s suspension
it should be a month’s imprisonment, to meet the
case of a simple appropriation of money by a
solicitor. It may go even further still. Jack
Lade proposed to hang all lawyers. Metaphorical
suspension only goes half way.
Melbourne’s latest light - refreshment re-
treat was opened with music and song the other
afternoon, at 23 Little Collins-street, under the
style of the Treasury Luncheon, Tea, and Supper
Rooms. Conducted by ladies for ladies—not to
mention children and the other sex—the new
tea-shop ” will be found a desirable place for
assimilating the innocent draught of milk, the
pious muffin with tea, or the dissolute oyster in
the shell, any time up to 11.30 p.m.
Parson Haskett Smith’s uncharitable sum-
ming-up of Armenian character harmonises with
some recent intelligence from Asia Minor. A
wealthy Armenian, who had refused to contribute
money to the anti-Turk fund, was murdered by a
band of compatriots in the quite usual course of
things. One of 'the murderers being arrested, he
was shot dead by his pals on his way to gaol. It
was their simple Christian method of closing his
mouth. The Armenians, turbulent, treacherous,
cowardly, and altogether contemptible, are what
oppression and the Bible have made them.
Brunswick (Melb.), the scene of the Orange-
and-Green faction-fight, is inhabited mostly by
laborers—brickmakers and other hard-grafters—
and is about equally divided in “color.” The
Orangemen started the row by obtaining permis-
sion from the local civic authorities to “procesh ”
(thereby endeavoring to over-ride the Religious
Processions Act), though the police had distinctly
forbidden the proposed parade. A notable feature
of the insensate row was the fact that some of the
processionists blasphemously used golden wattle-
blossom, the Australian floral emblem, as an
Orange symbol. The Bulletin cordially hopes
that the next man who tries to convert wattle-
blossom to base Irish uses will have his nose
knocked off by the Mickies.
As The Bulletin goes to press, the very
latest story about Premier Reid’s “ faked ” statis-
tics re the Government stores that were 50 per
cent, cheaper in Sydney than in Melbourne, is
that G. Reid disclaims all responsibility—he took
the figures trustfully, like a little child, from the
Controller-General of Stores, and for everything
that is wrong that unhappy person is wholly
responsible. The Controller-General, according to
Age and Argus, explains that he unfortunately
took a very old list, belonging to days when prices
were much higher than they now are, and that he
didn t know there was any newer list in existence
The Melb. papers allege that the Stores Depart-
ments of the two provinces exchange lists regu-
larly, that the new lists were sent as usual, and
that the Controller received an extra copy of them
on his recent visit to Melb., when he was making
l *P h ls comparison of alleged prices ; consequently
they consider the explanation a great deal more
remarkable than the trouble itself. Anyhow
Premier Reid gets out, as usual ; it was all the
fault of the other fellow.
The following letter, from the N.S.W. ex-
Sheriff, appears in Bathurst Advocate of a recent
date, and, following upon the famous letter by the
same gentleman in Sydney Daily Telegraph,
shows that the writer will lose no time in taking
the scaffold that is to say, the hustings— to
demand that the body of the Bathurst elector
shall be delivered to him :
Sir,—Jurors, as a rule, complain that they are summoned
too often, and cannot get excused. Now is the time to
state their grievances, and have them redressed The
Minister for Justice is introducing a Bill to consolidate
and amend the jury laws. It is their opportunity now
or never to meet and discuss the subject. I propose they
hold pubhc meetings, and send their suggestions to me' •
I will look after it in Parliament. Recollect, “ United
ye stand, dissevered ye fall.” A long pull, a strong pull,
and a pull together, and you will obtain a hearing
Twenty years ago I proposed jurors’ fees should be in-
creased. Raise the cry, “ Justice to jurymen” when vou
can ; if you pull together rest certain of obtaining- your
just demands.—l am, &c., Charles Cowper. I intend to
visit Bathurst shortly, and discuss the matter.
The ex-Sheriff isn’t in Parliament yet, but he
evidently assumes that he can’t help getting there
Meanwhile, his old profession sticks out con-
spicuously. His metaphors about a long pull and
7™ , other kinds of pull savour of the rope.
United ye stand is quite correct; it comes
after the pull and suggests the erect position of
the body at the end of the rope when the pull is
finished. Dissevered ye fall ’’—naturally. The
gentle Cowper was possibly thinking of cases
much di h op head C ° meS ° ff the sub J eet through too

tale lines of the year, and renews the delicate

The suicide, last week, of N.S.W Under
Sheriff Morgan, immediately after his official pro-
motion has been variously attributed to a love-
affair, to extra official work forced upon him, and
to the deceased gentleman’s horror of the ghoulish
duty of superintending executions. Apropos the
writer not long since had an interesting talk with
a certain Australian sheriff, addicted to going about
his hanging-work in a most practical way He
was, he explained, wont to drop in upon the
deceased -that was-to-be — the day before 11,.,
gallows, while the hangmen were greasing the
rope and mention to him that it was a really
painful situation for—grim humorist!—the officers
of the law, and that said officers were greatly dis-
tressed about themselves, and that the hangee
could make things much more pleasant for them
if he would attend to certain hints as to the
manner of being executed, which hints-including
instructions as to toeing the hangman’s chalked
line and so on-the kindly old sheriff then S

London Evening News is still stealing
original Bulletin stories and palming them off as
its own. Its two latest thefts are “ Spicer’s Court-
ship,” by Edward Dyson, and “Waiting,” by
Henry Eletcher.
Sydney D.T., in its article on the Burns
centenary: “ The poet’s father was a man of
deep-seated religious convictions. So, indeed, was
his mother.” Later on: “In his outer man the
poet resembled his mother.” Surely an Irish
gentleman hath done these things?
At Rangiora (M.L.) a zealous church-per-
son has been fined Jss. for prodding a lady with the
collection-bag to induce her to subscribe. Some
day the energetic individual who carries the chief
symbol of Christianity on the end of a stick will
extinguish somebody’s eye with it, and then the
collection will be run in for manslaughter.
In a Melb. County Court case, last week,
it transpired that the defendant, a dentist, had
commissioned plaintiff to write him an advertising
pamphlet into which he was to weave certain bits
of bright literary material, such as “ two-thirds of
his beard fell on the floor with a sickly thud.” The
author protested against the idea of anybody’s
hair being capable of a thud, but he wrote the
pamphlet. Also, he got a verdict for £2 a column.
A deputation of holy men waited upon
Vic. Mines Minister Foster the other day to
request him to insert a Clause in the Amended
Mines Bill, prohibiting miners from undermining
the churches. Pawky Brother Balfour was
“ awfu’ ’ shocked at the idea that peradventure
some Sunday a minister of the Gospel would
drop through the church floor with his pulpit and
never be heard from in the flesh again. This com-
plaint comes rather late. The churches are
already hopelessly undermined.
Prof. Anderson Stuart, the great N.S.W.
official Pie Biter, has thought fit to resign the
post of Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Stuart’s deter-
mination to draw in future only one fat salary in-
stead of two is possibly coincident with the
general opinion that any man who enthusi-
astically discharged his duties as a university
professor would have no time left to act as presi-
dent of the Board of Health. Prof. Stuart is
succeeded as Chief Medical Adviser by the ener-
getic and competent Dr. Ashburton Thompson,
who has long done most of the work attaching to
the position.
N.S.W. Public Service Board has pretty
well erased the biggest blot in its retrenchment
scheme so far, by annulling most of its Educa-
tion Department reductions and giving the
teachers fairer play. Teachers want all the fair
play the country can give them. True that their
routine work covers only about five hours a day
for five days a week, and they have a couple of
months’ vacation per annum as well; but if they
would advance in their profession, and do justice
to their scholars, they must work much longer
and harder than these figures imply. Their men
tal strain is considerable; their duties are most
important; yet their pay is small, and promotion
comes slowly. If the Education Department
wants bright spirits, and not mechanical drudges,
it must make its service tempting. And—on
second thoughts—the Public Service Board sees
this.
Butler, the notorious criminal, on his trial
in Melbourne for sticking-up and housebreaking,
told the jury that if the evidence given against
him was true he was such an ass that in the event
of their finding him guilty they should recom-
mend him to mercy on the grounds of insanity.
This address was smart and logical, and, guilty or
not guilty, he showed himself to be the victim of
the old outrageous abuses of the system of con-
ducting a case against a Crown prisoner. The
papers had filled the country with prejudice before
a word of evidence was taken, he said. “ The
police and the Crown had every facility in working
up a ease against him, while he had not even been
allowed a morsel of paper, and had not been
allowed to see the directory to find the address of
a witness.” The old trouble—-trial by policeman
for policeman. The whole system bolsters the
constables’ cherished convictions. Woe betide
the wretch who is guilty in the eye of the police-
man !
The Argus, in a recent ponderous leader,
abuses Premier Seddon for “ associating himself
with private enterprises of magnitude, the success
or non-success of which was likely at some time or
another to be affected by some action of the
Government.” Half-a-column is devoted to man-
handling Seddon for this, and another half-column
(same article) is taken up with a malicious ridicul-
ing of Premier Kingston, apparently because he
absolutely refused to be associated “ with a private
enterprise of magnitude,” and fired Watt out of
his office. The moral is that no Democrat can do
right, and when he does the thing that seems right
he is only a little more awful, and debasing, and
utterly unworthy than when he glories in open and
unblushing iniquity, and anyhow there is no health
within him. _ The drop from twopence to a penny
has not satisfied the prodigal instincts of the
Argus—it now persistently gives itself away.
Lambert Bros., the N.S.W. ironfounders,
write to the papers about the way in which the
Reid Ministry proposes helping local industry
over the steel-rail contract. According to their
report, the terms are that the rails are to be made
locally, with local coal and iron ore ; that the
Govt, reserves power to appoint some person—
who possibly knows nothing about steel-making—
to supervise the work and give orders which may
wreck the whole business ; that this same official
may order the immediate dismissal of any person
engaged on the job, so that he may actually sack
the hrm s expert and leave everything stranded ;
that the Govt, also reserves power to vary the
specification as the work goes on, which may mean
an enormous increase of cost; that despite this
interference the firm is responsible for the perfec-
tion of the work; and that even after rails have
been examined and accepted, the Govt, reserves
u \ to reject them on after consideration,
and throw them back on the makers’ hands. And
the firm asks m a deep voice if the Govt, runs its
English contracts on this basis, or reserves these
terms for the discouragement of local industry.


Of Australian producers, the manufacturer
of wines and spirits has, in all markets, been com-
bated by so strong a prejudice that it seemed vain
to hope for the ultimate awakening of the discrim-
inative faculties of consumers. Long patience
and perseverance have at length, however, won
due recognition for Joshua Brothers, whose now
well-known Victorian distillery, costing AloO,OUO,
is one of the three finest in the world. Their
Boomerang brandy, after crucial tests, has been
recently adopted by the British Amiralty, War
Office, army hospitals, and House of Commons.
Also, it won highest award at the exhibition qi
Bordeaux, beating the famous products of that
Cognac centre. And in Germany, by its convinc-
ing merit, it has evoked praises from the national
palate. In N.S.W. and Q. the control of
Boomerang Brandy is in the capable hands of
that wealthy firm, Messrs. A. Hoffnung and Co.,
who will doubtless push it in a degree commen-
surate with its value. The latest credential: ‘ In
Coolgardie, Perth, and all through Westralia the
sick and the well universally swear by Joshua
Brothers’ Boomerang Brandy.”

“ PSYCHE AT THE WELL”
The first “ Sir” to set foot on Australian
soil was Henry Brown Hayes, who had been sen-
tenced to death in Ireland for forcible abduction,
but was sent instead, title and all, to the An-
tipodes.
There died at South Yarra last week, aged
82, an old Maitland, N.S.W., identity in the per-
son of Miss Grace Frances Rusden, daughter of
Rev. E. K. Rusden, first colonial chaplain on tfie
Hunter.
The daughter of Stuart Donaldson, the first
N.S.W. Premier under Responsible Government,
was recently married to a Bethnal Green curate,
the son of a peer. It is 40 years since her father
bossed N.S.W. politics.
It has been put about that Lord Hopetoun

The ex-Gov. is in fair running for the Canadian

Only the most brazen audacity or the most
ineffable stupidity could have put up Minister

Duffy pere has had at the expense of the Victorian
taxpayer.
Tasmanian Parliament adjourned for a
week out of respect to T. Reibey, M.H.A., whose
wife has just died. “I suppose, says an irreverent
correspondent, “that when Mrs. Reibey s husband
dies—Thomas is the oldest member of the House
—Parliament will adjourn for at least six months.
Henry Lucy is allowed to publish in S.M.
Herald details of the quarrels between the
Ingrams and Watkins, of England—which quar-
rels were purely personal and family, and yet the

nalism is a class of work to which it will never give
countenance.

punished for blasphemous interference with Upper
Crust privileges.”
J C. F. Johnson, who recently sold tfie
Maritana mine in London, was originally a Regis-
ter reporter, afterwards editor and proprietor of
Adelaide Punch, long dead. In fact, it was dead
when it was alive. Johnson maue a fortune by-
selling a Woodside mine, the Bird-m-Hand, and
afterwards entered S.A. 1 arliament.
N.S.W. ex-Sheriff Cow per, like Governor

practically retired from that vocation.
Comment at the French National Fete, m
Correy’s Gardens, Sydney, at the close of B. R.
Wise’s French speech : ‘ ‘ Why is it that most men

ing of generalities? Is a tendency to generalize
a note of not-quite-at-homeness in the particular
language used ? ” ,

Premier Reid’s snoring is about on a par
with Yic. Chief Sec. Peacock’s laugh. Coming
down Tweed River (N.S.W.) recently, the Pre-
mier fell asleep and snored so terrifically asi to
scare away two swallows that had lived on the
little river-boat for years. [This is an excellent
perjury.] (1.13. also possesses the faculty of

with this very moderately - prized distinction.
Putting aside the lafe Parkes, no man in the front
rank, however, received the title. Clockm iker
Tornaghi, Museum Ramsay, Immigration Wise,

for native Italians and the other for foreigners,
but publicly and socially the distinction is the
same.
A somewhat young but very bald Melb.
barrister had a painful up-country experience the
other week. Whilst he was talking, with his
hat on, to a solicitor in the court
corridor, the father of his client came
up and lamented the brainless ap-
pearance of counsel engaged for the
defence. The young barrister, in the
anxious parent’s opinion, had “a
nice face, but no intellect.” Warn-
ing coughs from the solicitor were
ignored by the third party, who was
still deploring the emptiness of the
advocate’s moulting skull, when
somebody hailed the owner by name.
“ Are you • ? Let me see you
again with your hat off,” said old
Mr. Blank, whereupon the bar-
rister meekly doffed his bell-
topper and stood revealed.
The impenitent critic,
by way of not offering
an apology, _ remarked
that the practice of cover-
ing up a bald head is a
delusion and a snare, from
which poor was at
liberty to infer that he
would inspire more confidence
if he wore his hat in court. However, in due
course he made a favorable impression on the
irreverent gentleman by getting his relative ac-
quitted.

tralian scrip.
Parkes’s fine old house at Fauloonbridge
has been turned into a boys’ school; Dailey’s
“castle” at Manly (now the residence of a
squatter’s widow) was turned into a girls school.
Parkes and Dailey were their own architects in
the devising and arrangement of the buildings,
and each intended his edifice to be the abode of
high thinking and ripe experience. All things
end where they began.
Meagher alleges that, in his recent hotel-
shindy with Crick, he was badly handicapped by
an abscess on his jaw. There was no abscess on
his conversation, anyhow, judging by the inter-
views ” which appeared in next day s papers.
While Meagher is thus crippled he ought to fight
through a telephone, or else wear boxing-gloves o
his mouth. The man who recklessly charges his
enemy with his best fighting organ crippled courts
defeat.
Coalfields-Examiner Mackenzie, who now,
at the age of 63, retires from N.S.W. public ser-
vice, fought the stormy petrels of Parliament
during many sessions. About 10 years ago, the
Radicals of that day made it an article of faith to
“ dish ” Mackenzie, and night after night his dis-
missal hung in the balance. And Mackenzie,
though a public servant, fought hard and openly,
and beat his opponents, most of whom are now
either dead or out of Parliament.
Melb. : “This city is the worst teetotal
sermon ever known. Never a teetotal moneyed man
in it who did not burst to shivers. Premier Heaies
led the way for Munro, as the luckless ones in
politics. It was argued that teetotal building-
societies could not fail to nick the com, but Munro,
Mirams, and all the promoters came croppers,
scattering ruin. Meanwhile, the good °Ww ns y-
picklers, who cannot be named with such freedom,
keeptbeir building-societies going, though launched
long before the water-irruption.
“The Boy Orator of Nebraska” makes
S.M. Herald think as loudly as it can without
mentioning names of Australia sJ. I. au-
field and Sydney’s Labonst Holman. Of course
the Herald treats such prodigies as barely
tolerable nuisances, and in some respects it is not
far out. But is not the Nebraska boy-orator as
opposed to M‘Kinley the latter-day counterpart
of Henderson Africanus as opposed to Oraham
Berry ? And the Tory press of the Berry day did
not take Africanus as a nuisance.
The name “ M. Bulot,” which appears on
“ The Romance of a Fair Girl’s Bathroom, is one
of anarchist Andrews’s pen-names. He wrote the
novel at Roolcwood, Sydney, in evil days, for a
pittance to subsist upon. It seems to have brought
in several hundred pounds to the booksellers, but
all that he got for it was three or four pounds, a
few shillings at a time. It is fair to say that, it
Andrews were put on his honor, he would probably
admit that the book isn’t worth a penny more.
The “ sell ” is all in the title.
Apropos the Vic. criminal-libel case of
Leader v. Tuthill, a somewhat similar case excited
much interested in S.A. in 1876. W. Villeneuve
Smith wrote two letters to S.A. Advertiser,
exposing the errors, etc., of the local magistracy.
One letter was admirably judicial m tone, but the
second was thought to have overstepped the mark,
involving, as it did, serious charges of nepotism
and favoritism against the prosecutpr, who was
the presiding magistrate in the leadnf|g local court.
The case came on before Judge Stow and a jury,
who found W.V.S. guilty as regards the second
letter. An enormous number of law points were
raised, but were all over-ruled both by Full Court
and Privy Council. Even after the sentence
habeas corpus points were raised. So we may
expect a legal treat in the coming tussle with such
an old police-court adept as the late member tor
Gobung.
There has recently been placed in the hall
of Yic. Parliament House a painting of a singular-
looking personage, in the costume of a comic-opera
duke, wearing white tights, a scarlet robe, padded
calves, and ballet-dancer shoes, with white bow s
on them. Speculation has been rife as to whether
this is a portrait of Joe Tenor Tapley in Ihe
Gondoliers,” an object from Kreitmayers Wax-
works, or Alfred Deakin as he will be if he goes on
progressing in the wearing of Court uniforms. Iu
turns out, after the Labor corner had almost
resolved to move for a Royal Commission of inves-
tigation, that the thing is supposed to be a portrait
of the gentleman who officiated as husband to Queen
Viotoria and was known as Prince Albert, there
is a bit of blue ribbon round the knee, upon which
is some gilt lettering. The only word clearly
visible is ‘ ‘ Mai. ’ ’ Descriptive.
THAT STEAK AGAIN.
“ Waiter.”
“ Yessir.”
“This steak is much smaller than the one I had
yesterday. ”
“ Yessir! It’s off a smaller box!”
Probably the best testimonial ever received
by any Australian politician was that given to
Deakin by Stephen Oureton, the gaudy, flashy,
cynioal Yankee who came to Australia because
he got into a shooting-scrape in America, and
incidentally started the Mildura irrigation settle-
ment. Said Cureton in his evidence :
He fought us inch by inch, telling us that he must frame
the concession in such a shape that, if we failed to fulfil
our obligations, the land must revert to the Crown. I rom
first to last he was too much for us. . . Mr. Deakin did
his duty thoroughly. His one desire seemed to be to do
the best he could for his native land. We never tried to
“ influence ” him, though we had discussed it among our-
selves. The man was unapproachable. . . Mr. Deakin
was as steadfast as the Bock of Ages.
Only one man in 100,000 earns such a character as
that. Gillies’ old-time colleague has had many
political successes, but the brightest moment m
his life was when the Amurrikin person, who came
over here on account of a shooting-scrape, lounged
into the witness-box with his store-clothes on, and
carefully placed his shiny plug-hat on the ledge,
and stated on oath through his nose that even the
Chaffey firm didn’t dare to so much as hint at cor-
ruption to Alfred Deakin.

One James Dunham, 30 years old, put up
a murder-record at San Jose, California, in May
last when he manufactured six corpses m about
5 mm. Dunham lived with his wife at a farm
belonging to his father-in-law, Col. M Glmchey,
and began operations by carving up Mrs. D. with
an axe. The sound of the blows brought a ser-
vant-girl to the room, and the keen blade broke
her skull the moment she appeared at the door.
Dunham then chopped his mother-in-law exceed-
ing small, and continued to chop her until the
colonel and his 16-year-old son knocked at the
front door. With characteristic courtesy Dunham
immediately threw open the portals, and downed
his father-in-law with a neat cut on the side of the
head. Stress of work, however, had rendered his
hand unsteady, and the colonel lost only his right
ear and a bit of his cheek. Meanwhile, the boy
grappled with Dunham, and succeeded m getting
the axe from him. But the murderer was a
man of resource, and before his brother-in-law
could raise the axe, he drew a revolver and shot
him dead. M‘Glinchy, senior, had meanwhile
scooted, and Dunham set off in pursuit. Meeting
the hired man in the yard he incidentally shot
him dead, and followed M'Glinchy to a stable,
where the latter barred the door. A few pot-shots
through the keyhole did no good, but an attempt
at a bolt by the colonel during the momentary
absence of the murderer gave the latter the chance
he wanted, and a second later a sixth corpse was
added to the list. Dunham then made a careful
search of the whole premises for the sole remaining
occupant, another hired man, but the latter hid
under a bale of hay and escaped. Ihe murderer
got clean away and had not been found when the
mail left.


Reference was made at the public meeting held
in connection with the recent 12th of July celebra-
tions to the fact that precedence wa3 given at
Government House to Cardinal Moran in connec-
tion fcith certain functions the\e over thb Primate.
1 On inquiry at Government House, we learn that
this matter was settled by a previous Governor
some time ago, when it was decided that the head
of either the Church of Efngland or the Roman
Catholic Church should talco the first place accord*
]ing to the date of appointment.

SEVERAL SMALL MATTERS.


It was a',
confidence man who defrauded her. Karlv
in the week he waited upon her, and with
the guileless manner of a countryman said
• he proposed to go to the races and would
like to be informed whether he would .be *
lucky or unlucky./ The fortune-teller con»
suited the cards with much deliberation,
and ceremony, and eventually informed the
stranger that “ he would have a good win—
he would be very lucky.’" Much gratified
mparcntly the stranger paid the usual fee
and departed. On Friday night he re-
turned and smiling happily said he had
had a good win as she had predicted, and he
wanted to give her a small present. Pro-
ducing a £5-note he bade her take £2 out
of it for herself. She willingly complied*.

The Edinburgh Scotsman, in its review of
Paterson’s “ Man from Snowy River ” (price,
ss. 4d. post free, from Angus and Robertson,
Sydney, and all booksellers), says : “It has good
‘go’ of its own. It has the saving grace of
humor. . . . Will have a hearty welcome
here. . . . It is worth a dozen of the aspiring,
idealistic sort, since it has a deal of real laughter,
and a dash of real tears in its composition.”
The Literary World says : “We turn to Mr.
Paterson’s roaring muse with instantaneous grati-
tude, and we hope to meet him again.” “ The
Man from Snowy River, and Other Verses,” by
“ The Banjo,” may be had post free from Angus
and Robertson, Sydney, for ss. 4d. in stamps of
any colony.
A. B. Paterson’s “ Man from Snowy River ” has
proved one of the successes of the season in Eng-
land. The London Times referred to “ its stir-
ring ballads with lilt and swing in their rhythm ”
and said : ‘‘ At his best, Mr. Paterson compares
not unfavorably with the author of ‘ Barrack
Room Ballads.’” The eighth-thousand of “The
Man from Snowy River ” is now ready, and may
be had from Angus and Robertson, Sydney, and
all booksellers.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
All odds on Mason for Vic. Speakership.
A N.S. Wales M.P. is understood to have
assigned his estate for the benefit of his creditors,
but has not resigned his seat in Parliament.
One section of N.S.W. Cabinet favors
prosecutions in certain of the big dummying-
cases. But that section isn’t going to prevail.
u Thus Vie. Tory M.L.A. Murray Smith :
The first obligation of a citizen is energy, his
first danger apathy.” Thus does Toryism un-
knowingly sharpen the weapon of Democracy.
Premier Reid at Kiama : “In Sydney and
suburbs there were only 1500 unemployed.” And
yet Sydney Benevolent Society has ' about 1200
unemployed on its books Are all the unemployed
being kept by the Benevolent Society ?
At length the Lords have passed the
Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill. What about the
mental calibre of a ruling chamber that has taken
50 years to discover the advantage of more than
one marriage and only one mother-in-law ?
“ What on earth has Mr. Brunker ever
done that he should be N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary?” Well, Mr. Brunker is a bland and holy
cow-merchant who writes a lovely copper-plate
hand. He is also brother-in-law to the S.M.
Herald.
S.A. National Ass crowd, in addition to
being torn by internal dissensions, has now lost
Willcox, one of its nominees, who was unseated
for holding Govt, contracts, and on a re-election
defeated by Randall, a Govt, supporter. The
“ intelligent phalanx ” grows smaller daily. jj*
The Tas. House of Landlords naturally
favors the “wealth” tax proposals. Treasurer
Pysh declares that the Govt, will fight the Upper
House for the taxation of land-values. A real
battle between the two Houses in Tas. would be
a greater surprise than a snowstorm at Brewarrina.
In Vic. Assembly the other day Prender-
gast alluded to railway-boss Mathieson as the
“cast-off ”of another province. Inasmuch as the
aforesaid “cast-off” has just cast off ,£3OOO per
innum for the increased salary of £3500, he will
probably bear these little slights with equanimity.
The Irishmen of Australia have decided to
send delegates to the Convention which meets in
Dublin in Sept, for the purpose of making peace
between the Irish Parliamentary factions. What
weapons the Australian representatives will carry
is hot stated, but the fight should be an elegant
one.
The Villiers and Heytesbury election,
Vic., has resulted in the return of J. M. M‘Arthur,
a hardshell Tory of the Staughton school, whose
great object in emerging from his native obscurity
is to prevent the accomplishment of the damnable
heresy of one-man-one-vote and to kill customs
duties, excepting as a means of revenue.
Argus rages over the cost of the Sangster
Board as a grave waste of public money, induced
by the carping of a wretched Labor-member. The
Argus is always chock-full of saving grace when
it is proposed to spend money in exposing the
little weaknesses of its cliques. The country can
never afford the rope to hang any of these.
Talk of Kingston voluntarily abdicating
the Q. Premiership is scoffed at by a Sydney poli-
tician who has had correspondence with the
Northern “Cactus” (so-called because of his
prickly manners). Nevertheless, Nelson’s retire-
ment was decided on, and only Attorney-General
Byrnes’s defeat at N. Brisbane has postponed it.
A serious danger in Bananaland lies in the
fact that the number of employers of aliens is in-
creasing in a much greater ratio than the number
of aliens themselves. The heathen is become more
widely distributed. In ’94 there were 774 em-
ployers of aliens ; in ’95 no less than 1001. (This
estimate takes no account of the Japs., hundreds
of whom have recently landed.)
Hardly a year ago an effective Protectionist
meeting in Sydney was impossible; while the
other evening a huge crowd packed the Protestant
Hall and cheered two very dull speeches by Lyne
and See, full of figures which nobody understood,
not even the speakers, but which everyone
applauded for the reason that in some vague way
everyone felt that they were agin the Reid Govern-
ment.
The death of Queen Victoria was pro-
phesied at a very fashionable Sydney spiritualistio
seance, last week, as being due about the middle
of Aug. next. This should stir up poet Neild to
attack Parliament anew with his Commissions
Extension Bill. What will happen to several
portions of the N.S.W. Constitution when Her
Majesty drops off is quite unknown to subjects at
large.
Barrister Fisher is vigorously pointing out
the anomalous position of Vic. Crown prosecutors.
These functionaries, compelled both to decide
whether a case is fit for prosecution and to prose-
cute it, are virtually forced to strain every nerve
to secure some sort of a conviction, instead of
seeking to aid the court to obtain justice, which
is, according to the highest legal authorities, their
proper function. In no place more than in Victoria,
where the Attorney-General, the person nominally
responsible for the initiating enquiries, is often a
mere figurehead from the legal point of view, is
the English system of a Director-General of Prose-
autions desirable.
At Kiama, N.S.W. Premier Reid loudly
shouted that “as long as he was Treasurer his
name would never be associated with a deficiency.”
Very likely: according to precedent, it won’t be
until the next Treasurer arrives that the “Reid
deficit ” will become manifest. That’s the way
Treasurers are built.
The Truck Bill
now before N.S.W.
Parliament comes
ninety years after
the Macarthur re-
bellion, which really
began in a truck-
feud of that distant
time. Macarthur
and other worthies,
who had possessed
themselves of the
means of production
and distribution in
the infant settle-
ment, practically
swindled laborers
out of their hire by
obliging them to
take goods instead
of wages, and the
injustice became at
last so flagrant that
Gov. Bligh issued
his little Truck Act.
This Governor sim-
ply demanded that
men should be paid
in coin and left free
to spend it after-
wards where and
how they liked. But
Macarthur was a
power in those days,
and, complicating
the issue with one
or two other griev-
ances, he succeeded
in wrecking the
Government. Bligh
was put under ar-
rest, and, though
afterwards the Brit-
ish authorities ap-
proved of his official
actions, employers
of the Macarthur
type were left free
to go on paying wages in rum and calico.
When Treas. Reid alludes to the “ O’Sulli-
Austin Chapmans” there’s just that sus-
P'cion of adroitly twisting the Yellow Pup’s tail
which was one of Parkes’occasional master-strokes
in cases of necessity. After all, Reid has been a
close student of Parkes’ methods; and the old
man lived long on a lynx-eyed fear that Protec-
tion was somehow or other associated with Popery,
brass money, wooden shoes, &c., and opposed to
the glorious Dutchman who crossed the Boyne
with J. C. Neild and John Haynes.
ANCIENT HISTORY IN THE BUSH.
JACK: “ Now , Moses appears to me as the greatest general of all time.”
JOE : “ How? ”
JACK : “ Well, look how he led those Jews for forty years from Egypt to Canaan.”
JOE : “ Yes! He may have been a great general, but he was a blanky bad bushman. Wouldn't
do for this country, Jack. Ye Gods, forty years!”
The recent N.S.W. Financial Statement
contained, besides the usual figure-juggling, a
good deal which belongs properly to an elec-
tioneering speech. For example, the proposal to
hold an International Exhibition has not much to
do with a balance-sheet, unless as a means of
squandering the alleged surplus. The last Exhi-
bition in 1879 was merely a glorified sample-room
for the world’s bagmen, and though the reputed
object of it was to show' all nations of the world
what Australia could sell to them, they mostly
had the best of the deal. There was a modified
boom for nine months or so, and then an ebb
tide, which has gone on ebbing ever since.
Premier Kingston’s pet measure, the Early
Closing Bill, passed its second reading in S.A.
Assembly by a majority of 15—illustrative of the
strength of the Democrats in the new Assembly.
Last year the Bill was rejected by six votes. Most
of those who then helped to defeat it are now poli-
tically extinct.
QUITE EASY.
(Local Police-court. Assault on a Chow.)
JAYPEE (to prisoner): “Well, Clancy, ye are a namesake o’ mine, hut, thank
God, ye are no relation. I’d rather he related to the Chinamam.”
CLANOY (winking at policeman) : “Sure, thin, why don't ye marry him to
wan o’ yer daughters? ”
The little Bill of Hancock, M.L.A., to
authorise lotteries in Victoria provided they are
run by Friendly Societies, has moved the Cham-
pion to publish some figures about the last Druids’
art-union. According to this statement, the public
subscribed £7072 Bs. and got back just .£1333 16s.
—whereas Tattersall, whom the law has kicked
out of Victoria, would give <£6300. If these
statistics are correct, and this art-union is a fair
sample, Hancock’s Bill was about the most fathom-
less piece of cheek on record, and Friendly Society
art-unions are hardly one remove from spieling
pure and simple.
Dear Bulletin, —One of your correspon-
dents asked, the other day, why the native Aus-
tralian was always politically hustled out of the
w-ay by the Tommy-Dodd-Rosa-Joe-Cook crowd
of new-comers. One reason I advance in good
faith, viz., that the native-born Australian seldom
has a good church connection, a powerful factor in
politics; and, moreover, comparatively rarely
belongs to a seeret society of any color; and with-
out these necessary aids I don’t know of any pro-
vince where they succeed, except Victoria, where
the Australian Natives’ Association has scotched
sectarianism by establishing a new sect for the
native-born.—Yours, Cornstalk.
The N.S.W. Protectionist bosses should
explain how it comes that the Australian Star,
of which financially-successful speculation several
of them are influential directors, imports, at low
British-syndicate prices, nearly all the purely-
literary matter that it doesn’t clip. Is there a
leading Freetrade paper in Australia more con-
sistently Foreign-trade than the Star in this par-
ticular respect ?
South Queensland, the head of whose in-
flamed pimple is Brisbane, is against Australian
Federation; Central and Northern Q. seem in favor
of it. Possibly, for one reason, because Federation
may be a step towards the division of Leperland
into states, whereby Brisbane would lose its privi-
lege of robbing the Central and Northern areas,
and the latter would have the fun of spending
their own revenues on themselves.
Salmon, M.L.A., pleaded successfully for
an amendment of the Vic. Dog Bill, whereby an
owner will be allowed to register one dog free of
tax. To butcher Wilkins’s objection that valu-
able lives were sacrificed to vagrant curs, the
medical Salmon replied that the contagious sausage
was just as dangerous. “In the form of sausage,”
said Salmon, ‘ ‘ the stray dog is a menace to the
public meal.” Wilkins collapsed.
Duncan Gillies’s term as Vic. Agent-
General is almost through. The Argus presumes
that the return of the florid little man to local
politics will not be without its effect in hastening
the restoration of confidence. Duncan, the boom-
Premier who scattered borrowed millions to the
four winds, is the smartest political-confidence
man Victoria has known, and he never yet won
the confidence of the ingenious elector without
violating it.
Something like this scheme may shortly be
presented to N.S.W. Government. Taking Han-
sard to cost ,£7OOO a year —shorthand, £2500 ;
printing, binding, paper, &c., £4402, as per a late
return —a master-printer is prepared with that
subsidy to issue a daily sheet, newspaper size, on
fair paper, containing all the Parliamentary busi-
ness of each session, and to sell it at Id. per copy.
In addition to reports of Parliamentary business
he will print all advts. relating to Govt, affairs,
thus enabling the colossal expense of current-
newspaper advertising to be avoided. To prevent
fear of deficient publicity his proposal is that
Govt, should notify in a couple of lines in the
ordinary journals where the detailed ads. might
be found.
Treas. Reid knows the value of phrases
and nick-names. For some years he used the cry,
“Dibbs deficit,” with great advantage; though
the deficit thus christened was anyone’s deficit, or
rather was the accumulated delinquency of
previous treasurers “ converted ” into one stock at
Dibbs’s expense. But now Reid, the adroit
dabster, begins to talk of a “ Lyne deficit. ” Soon
the Dibbs deficit and the Reid surplus will mean
precisely the same thing.
Goulburn, N.S.W., Land Board, on the
14th July, gave notice of its intention to hold the
formal inquiry as to fulfilment of conditions, prior
to issue of certificate, in respect of nine conditional
purchases. Of these, six stand in the names of
different banks, and only three in those of indi-
viduals. The area going to the former is 791 a.,
and to the latter 130 a. Of 19 appeals against pas-
toral rents assessed by the Wilcannia Land Board;
14 are in the names of financial institutions.
H. : “ Trenwith, in England, will make a
far better impression than any of our previous
exportations, and is already getting to work on the
oratorio. Here is a man with stuff in him, able to
get it out, a combination hitherto unknown, popu-
larly, in Australians at that end. Berry hardly
ever came before the English public, save in a
little parish-vestry glorification at Chelsea, where
some said he had worked as a tailor —others
said he hadn’t. Deakin, in London, only managed
to shine in a confab with Salisbury and others, and
receive an assurance that the House of Commons
panted for him.”
Vic. Bar waking up. M‘Cay, of Castle-
maine, addressed a democratic crowd on a
late Sunday afternoon, at Richmond market,
on voting duties and responsibilities. Robin-
son plugged away at a suburban church de-
bating society the other day to
cries of “ Yarra banker!” “An-
archist!” etc., on advanced
socialism. Eagleson enlightened
the Yackandandah farmers
lately on the significance of the
political Higinbotham. Mackey
(who has still unfortunately got
the Hirschian measles) is con-
tinually at work on land reform.
Higgins is the centre of gravity of
a hopeful sort of philosophical radicalism. And
Irvine is willing to go further lengths with his
employers’ liability and land-tax proposals than
the Vic. democracy is likely to let him. Where is
Deakin ? And where is Shiels ?

M‘Cracken’s Brewery, Melb., promises to
achieve an export trade, as well as a local popu-
larity, for its Emu brand of light bitter beer. In
point of fact, the Emu Pale Ale is about the first
formidable rival to “Hinglish bittah *' that Vic-
toria has produced up to date. It is pale and
bright, hop-flavoured, free from sediment, and
devoid of headaching qualities. When first put
upon the market, last year, the demand ran it off
the market in a few weeks, so the present year’s
brew is now filling a long felt want. Compared
with the Melb. “ fighting beers ” of times not so
very long departed, M'Cracken’s new tipple marks
a really great advance in malt liquor manufacture,
and deserves a good word accordingly. *
There are few places in the N.S.W.
country districts where great difficulty has not
been experienced in securing a prompt and satis-
factory cash-purchase of the skins of our game.
Thousands of people could make a decent sum out
of these skins, and, at the same time, provide
themselves with good sport, if they knew where a
Sydney buyer could always be found. A house,
specially devoted to the purchase of skins of the
kind mentioned and dealing direct with the trap-
pers, &c., has been opened at 9, 11 and 13 Young-
street, Circular Quay, Sydney, where Messrs.
Geo. Wilcox and Co. notify that they are buyers
of kangaroo, wallaby, rabbit, opossum and bear
skins, and will deal with equal readiness in small
or large parcels. G. W. and Co. are cash buyers,
and furnish price-list free on application so that
the consignor knows “ where he are,” in a manner
of speaking The firm sends the money by return
of post.*

Maggie Moore’s weakness in “Trilby” is the weakness
6f her sex behind the lights. Old and young, small and
bulky, with very few exceptions they will sacrifice art to
their unreasonable anxiety to look nice. Maggie can be
excruciatingly funny in low-comedy when she loosens
laces and lets herself go (as witness the influenza-ed slavey
in “ Our Flat”), but when “ on her own ” she insists upon
smart frocks and struggles to look well, and —
S.S.: “ Brown-Potter, who generally over-acts, under-
acts Violet Gresham in ‘ David Garrick,’ and her
restraint is not more convincing than her paroxysms are.
Physiologically and psychologically, the actress is angular ;
her knees and elbows and shoulder-blades are always in
evidence, and in her style there are no soft gradations and
voluptuous curves ; its knees stick out, it is angular and
hard, so that Mrs. B.P. cannot say ‘Dear daddy!’ to
Father Cathcart and sit on his knee without suggesting a
clothes-horse. It was said of David Garrick by a contem-
porary, ‘ Damn the fellow ! he could act a gridiron.’ I
believe Mrs. Brown-Potter’s interpretation of a hat-rack
would be an effort of genius.”
In “Trilby,” at Brisbane, one night, Miss Nagel, with a
bad cold, started to sing “ Ben Bolt,” and had got as far
as “Don’t you rememb” when she broke down ; but
Miss Cleveland was standing by, and at once took up the
word and sang the song through without the audience
being any the wiser. Next night the pianos got mixed ;
and when Gecko started to play in the last act, he struck
disjords, while the girl who always plays behind could
not get a sound out of her instrument, the wires being
disconnected. Then the assistant stage-manager had a
bad time.
Cockaigne: “Bellew’s Garrick is truer than Sothern’s
or Wyndham’s, inasmuch as he is always an actor. The
others were too much of the gentleman, the conception
too refined for a player.”
Miss Olliffe—a clergyman’s daughter, by the way—has
an offer to return to Australia, which would welcome her.
Though she made such an impression, with Willard, in the
“ Rogue’s Comedy,” the piece did not take.
Olga Nethersole, artistically, has mightily changed from
the bread-and-butter miss known in Australia. Her
Carmen in London, dramatic version, is talked of on every
hand as degrees coarser than Calve’s, and her portrait, in
the character, is that of a lovely, leary larrikiness.
Notices of Marie F.lster, in the English provincial papers,
get more flowery as she tours along. The Leigh Chroni-
cle said of her “Maritana” performance : “Miss Marie
Elster, the Australian prima donna, who, of course, is the
chief attraction, took the title-role in a superb manner.
She possesses a rich and very powerful voice of excep-
tional compass and extreme, &c., &c. Her acting, too, is
all that could be desired, &c., and the natural result was
a wonderfully fine impersonation.” Elster, no doubt, has
improved in every way during her travels with the Neil-
son Opera Co. A pity that she wasted so many of her
best years in Melbourne. Bertha Rossow, another Aus-
tralian who was quite an old-established matron before
she went ’Ome, appears to have won a piano in a musical
competition at London Agricultural Hall.
Re the dulness of theatre audiences, young Roberts,
the burlesque Svengali, tells a story about the late Teddy
Ryan, a good actor with a splendid thirst. Teddy was
cast for a small part in “ Master and Man,” or another of
Bland Holt’s dramas, and he had to come on unobserved
during a quarrel between two of the principals. Where-
upon he would say : “ It’s no business of mine ; the least
said the soonest mended,” and walk discreetly away. The
sentiment was popular, and Teddy also got a half volley
of applause for it. One night, having gone through a
very trying course of beer, the actor got his poor old
maxim rather mixed. “The least mended (hie) the
s-soonest said,” grunted Teddy. It made no difference.
He was applauded as seriously as usual.
“Eye-glass”: The first act of “Fun on the Bristol”
ends with a wild midnight burglar-alarm, or something
like that. At Melb. Bijou the splendid Marie Luella
strides calmly on when the commotion is at its worst,
and poses with evident pride in her bust and arms in a
magnetic night-drape. Art!
Henry Weir, the professional tenor who monopolised all
the solo-singing in Sydney a few months ago, fell in love
with a wealthy widow, married her, and bore her company
to England. It is announced that he has been studying
in London under Shakspere, and that he will soon be
warbling in Australia again.
Concert doesn’t catch on properly in Brisbane. The
English Concert Co. failed to fizz, and Trebelli, sup-
ported by local mummers, met with somewhat meagre
support.
Future engagements at Brisbane Opera House are Bland
Holt, Aug. 8 to 28, playing over Exhibition-week, and a
probable three lectures by Charles Clark on his return
from the North.
Alice Rees-Vogrich, the Australienne, hates the stage,
but her husband proposes to fetch her out, in London,
with his new opera. Bad line.
“ Locky ” M'Gowan is to have a benefit. He was in the
cast of “ The School for Scandal ” when old Melb. Royal
first opened, and is the last of that old school.
Reuben Fax says that the “ Trilby ” Co. liked Sydney
better than Sydney liked them.
Mrs. Potter and Bellew hope for a good season in
Sydney, on the fact that they did large business there six
vears ago, after having been rather coldly received in Mel-
bourne.
A. H. Gresham (A. H. Gee) should be getting along in
London. He is advertised by a big music-firm as intro-
ducing a new song by the fashionable Tito Mattei—who
doesn’t give his new songs to failures. Ada Crossley is
advertised as introducing a new song by Arthur Cecil,
“ Three Days of Love.”
The late Augustus Harris was a superstitious man, who
thought peacock’s feathers his bane. Melba was opening
her letters one day at Covent Garden on her birthday. A
card dropped from one. Harris stooped to pick it up, and
was horrified to see a design of peacock’s feathers. In
two seconds he had torn it into minute fragments.
Maggie Moore will, at the end of Aug., positively leave
for America, and there do a four months’ tour. Then she
returns to rejoice Australian hearts once more. She
already has Yankee dates fixed.
Trilby and Svengali were recalled to mind at the recent
Melb. Liedertafel concert. The manner in which clever
little Mdlle. Yvonne Leverrier(of Sydney) was accompanied
on to the platform, and her performance, supervised by
her teacher, and more especially the dazed manner in
which she makes for any part of the stage to go off until
her hand is seized by the watchful professor, gave the
audience a quite creepy, though, of course, unfounded,
impression of hypnotism in the air.
The Farnese Palace, which is a scene in “La Tosca,”
was built by Card. Farnese, who showed a Mendicant
Friar over it. Friar : “This money, brother, should have
been given to the poor.” “So it was, brother, but I made
them work for it.”
H. H. Vincent, our Englishman from Australia, gets
special kudos as Sir Oliver Surface, at the Wyndham
London Ben. In Melb. he was Sir Peter Teazle, to
Warner’s Charles and Anson’s Crabtree.
Gronow relates that Signora Catalani always knelt and
prayed at the wing before going on the operatic stage,
and he saw her do it, from a box. The same is alleged of
De Murska.
A man who is “ compelled by force of company to im-
bibe sometimes more freely than he would wish ” wrote
to Melb. Herald for an antidote to intoxication. The
journal gravely advised him to avoid temptation, or —if
he must frequent hotels —“ stick to soft stuff.” One
solid idea of an antidote is salt-and-water. That’s
what a certain mesmerist administers, after the perform-
ance, to the unfortunate subjects who have swallowed his
horrible compounds.
A movement is afoot in London to place a monument
on the grave of the Dacres.
“ The Boys of Australia” is the title of Clement Scott’s
latest jerry-built Jingo jingle.
H. : “The autobiography of J. C. Lambert, comedian,
seven vols MSS., is understood to be in the possession of a
nephew in Melb. Long ago a pressman was asked to edit
it, but decided it wouldn’t pay. What an extraordinary
idea actors have of the supreme importance of theatrical
politics ! ”
Blue-Tail Fly Barlow made some public appearances at
Melb. Exhibition, last week. He is endeavoring to trade
off his autobiography, but another generation arises,
indeed two more, and it is caviare to the general.
Mrs. Pat. Campbell and Forbes-Robertson are under
negotiation for the Australian trip.
Henry Howe, of the Irving Co., who died the other day
after 60 years’ continuous stage work, was in the original
casts of “ The Lady of Lyons ” (1838) and “ Richelieu ”
(1839).
“ The positively last appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Coppin
on any stage ” was advertised in Melb., June 18, 1846.
Bellew’s Marat voice is a reportorial memory of C. G.
Duffy.
Haresfoot : “ Talking of Brooke’s prompt-books. At
Cole’s Book Arcade, amid Harwood’s professional library,
I picked up the prompt copy, signed ‘ Hardy Oates,
Prompter,’ of ‘ Azael the Prodigal,’ as produced by Brooke
at the Melb. Royal, with Harwood, I believe, in the cast.
This scriptural drama gave Rignold and Walters the hint
for ‘ Joseph in Canaan.’ ”
In “ A Mother of Three ” the writer—a lady—has struck
a tolerably novel idea. An astronomical father goes to
Peru to observe the transit of Venus, and likes the place
so much that he remains there observing Venus for 20
years. A month after his departure his wife gives birth
to three daughters. She never ventures to break the nqws
to the parent in Peru. The girls grow up with no visible
male parent, and the explanation about the old man in
Peru is voted by society as too thin; in fast, society
decides that they have no producible father at all, and
practically shunts them. Finally, the mother proves the
absolute respectability of the family by personating the
father herself, and jusf when she has settled down com-
fortably in the part the Peruvian absentee turns up.
Consequently, after 20 years of scarcity, there is quite a
superfluity of father, and things are a good deal worse
than they were before.
One of the chief uses of encores at amateur concerts
appears to be that people may get something they can
understand after the “ fureign ” songs.
“Gulliver,” Williamson’s next Melb. Xmas Panto., is a
subject only done there once before, just 30 years ago, at
the Royal, by Akhurst, with Stewart as Gulliver, and
Harwood as Scrumpsheissa, a mock fairy in book-muslin
Scot Inglis is the youngest successful Silver King up to
date. 5.1., though looking older, is only 26, having been
born Nov., ’69. He is a Vic. native, and was intended for
the law.
Jennie Lee, interviewed in London : —“ lam sure there
is a great future coming for Victoria particularly. Yes, I
know money is rather scarce in that part just now ; the
people have lived too fast, but Victoria is full of gold.
Why, it actually lies on the surface in many places.” And
the mining prospectuses ! Some of them lie on the sur-
face. Jennie says she will make another tour half-round
the world and then “settle down for good in dear Aus-
tralia.” What has dear Australia done to deserve this ?
The “Mr. Money,” who figured on the Princess’s pro-
gramme as Charlotte Corday’s executioner, was Bellew
disguised. Marat, having been stabbed, washed off his
make-up and came along in a mask to take his assassin to
her doom. Mrs. P. wouldn’t trust the pinioning of her
fragile arms to an ordinary super.
Emily Soldene is evidently “up to snuff ” and doesn’t
pretend not to be. This is how the “ night out ”on the
Great Wheel in London—the “16 hours up among the
stars” that some 70 people experienced lately—struck
Emily’s imagination : —“ It was too dreadful. Soldiers
and sailors and policemen anxious to get to their duty.
Ladies out with other people’s husbands, and gentlemen
out with other people’s wives,..anxious to get back to
their duty. Hungry, thirsty, cold, miserable, frightened
to death.” How is it that Emily so naturally places the
agonies of a found-out conscience first, and physical hard-
ships and fears a poor second and third ?
Tommy Hudson shortly visits Melb. and Sydney to
organise a new variety co. for Westralia and India in Aug.
Hudson owns three theatres, one in Adelaide and two in
Calcutta.
Charles Hoyt, the man responsible for “ A Trip to
Chinatown,” is said to be worth £ 150,000. “ Chinatown ”
has given him £50,000.
A well-known Sydney mummer, during a period of
adversity, met, in a hotel bar, an old friend who gave
him a shilling or two, and, on leaving, admonished him
to be sure and spend the money on a square meal. Some
hours later the benefactor again called at the same hotel,
when the barman handed him a toothpick, remarking :
“Mr. told me to give you this, sir; he said he
reckoned that you’d know what it meant.”
Re recent Bulletin reference to the mango-trick, a
correspondent quotes that Jocolliot, who wrote an
elaborate treatise on the occult science of India, was of
opinion that some of the fakirs’ tricks might be explained
by a more thorough knowledge of electro-biology than we
possess. There are magicians, for instance, who by a
motion of the hand can so far influence a casual passer-
by as to prevent him from moving or speaking, and by a
super-position of both hands, more or less prolonged,
can so firmly fix a light chair to the floor that no effort of
the person directed suffices to remove it.
Theorbo : “ Stupid, this Blackwood article on singing
making women ugly. Why, have not the cantatrices
been noted for beauty, or, at all events, fascination ? All
of the present day on the operatic stage are handsome :
Patti, Melba, Calve, Eaines, Nordica, and so on, and the
public will not have aught else.”
A theatrical manager out there somewhere is a past
master of economy. It is necessary for several of the
characters to smoke cigarettes in scene 1, act 1., and three
boxes of 4d. smokes were included in the stage “ props.”
Presently a minion broke it to the boss, ever so gently,
that those cigarettes were all burnt. “ What!” bellowed
the boss, “already? Pour boxes of cigarettes smoked
already ?” So the manager went to each pro., asked
what was the smallest number of cigarettes he could do
with in the scene, and now three-a-penny poison tubes
are dealt out to the actors nightly. The performers
generously return the butts. The other night a malicious
pro. circulated a report that the cigarettes were not to be
lighted for that occasion, as it was a frosty night, and the
characters could breathe hard and imitate smoke.
Even the “loyal” cockney critics begin to gibe at the
tomfoolery attached to the opening of each grand opera
season at Covent Garden Theatre. All the artists assem-
ble on the stage round a plaster bust of Her Gracious and
sing the precious Anthem. They are mostly un-1 English
artists, who haven’t even a remnant of early reverence for
the Cjueen in theircomposition, and they sneer contemptu-
ously behind the curtain when the function has been put
through. It was introduced long ago by Michael Costa.
n affiliated Britisher of lackey instincts, and through
his musical mummery, more than by virtue of his ability
as a conductor, he became a knight.
The night of Sheet Anchor’s victory in Melb. Cup,
Horace Bent was playing with a nigger-minstrel co. in
Boomburstville. The holiday audience rose to one of his
topical songs, and yells of “encore’’rent the air. Bent
bowed, smiled effusively, waved for silence, and remarked,
“Yes! Sheet Encore.”
Very funny is Polly Emery’s Selina Sowerberry in
“ David Garrick,” and strengthens the little woman’s posi-
tion as the leading female humorist of the Australian
stage. When will she get a really big chance in a strong
low-comedy character ? It would pay a smart manager to
create the opportunity.
The 3d. gallery has come in Melbourne. Admittance
for the gods at the Cambridge (old St. George’s) to a de-
cent variety-show is 3d. per god. Baleful influence of
Protection again !
Next year will be the jubilee of Flotow’s opera,
“ Martha,” so it isn’t surprising to read in a recent
London notice that “ the interpolated ‘ Last Rose of
Summer ’ did not rouse the audience to the same
enthusiasm as in former days.”
“ Chattel-ton,” the new opera by the composer of
“ Pagliacci,” is a brilliant success, both as a musical work
and a poetic drama.
Maud Valerie’s “ Devout Lover” is being rushed by the
baritones of Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne.
Keith Macklin, Rickards’s new tenor, was born in
Dunedin, M.L. He goes to England and the Continent at
the end of the year to study. t
Rickards should warn each and every “ instalment ’
of his London stars to cultivate their H’s before perform-
ing in Australia. ‘‘ My ’umble ’ome,” “ I ’erd the ’urricane
’owl,” and so on, add new horrors to music-hall heroics
and bloated pathos.
Interviewer : ‘ ‘ And then?’ ‘ And then my friend Lord
Nozoo persuaded manager Craulflat that I would he a
valuable member of his company.’ ‘ And next ? ’ ‘ Next,
the Duke of Sapphira led to my engagement with Mr.
Woodlouse, the London manager, with whom I am
thoroughly satisfied,’ &c., &c.”
Circus-inan Chiarini would not have cream or piebald
horses, thinking them unlucky.
New York Times on a now world-famous singer in
whom Australia takes an interest: —“ What has
contributed to the dignity of operatic art in this
city ? Her frivolity on the stage cannot escape the notice
of the most casual observer. She giggles, makes faces,
nods to acquaintances in the opera club’s box, and gener-
ally comports herself in a free and untrammelled manner
in the most serious scenes of the roles. She knows less
about the technique of acting than the merest tyro in one
of our dramatic schools. But she is thoroughly satisfied
with herself, and her public is thoroughly satisfied with
her. All that is asked of her is to make sweet sounds,
and that she can certainly do. The technique of her
singing is the antipodes of that of her acting. She sings
like a bird, with a beautiful birdlike voice that fills the
whole atmosphere of the Opera House with the vibrancy
of its silvery tone. Her voice production is beyond
criticism, and her phrasing alone is open to question, and
that only occasionally. It is a pleasure to hear such
lovely tones projected with such consummate ease and
certainty. But when that is said, all is said. There is
nothing - else in -’s ‘ art ’ which so gets ‘ the start of
the majestic world.’ ”
“ Kendal would be an admirable comedian if he was
divorced.” — Bernard Shaw.
Dolores Drummond talks to a London interviewer. She
and her mother came to Melbourne 40 years ago, as
portrait-painters, but she had to take to the stage, under
the name of Dolly Green. Her enthusiasm over G. V.
Brooke is yet vivid.
Two promising Melbourne songstresses, who have still
much to learn, but don’t lack the necessary intelligence,
are Miss Topsy Cohn (a sweet soprano) and Miss Odell
Fawcett. The latter damsel has a strong, somewhat
hard, yet thoroughly musical contralto voice, and she
sings with enough dramatic expression to delight her
teacher, Buzzi. Also, she has apparently acquired from
the accomplished signor sundry small faults of pronun-
ciation. Buzzi reckons that Miss Fawcett has in her the
makings of a great operatic artist—the voice, presence,
and soul are all there. The money is not there at pre-
sent, but amiable Lady Clarke has engaged the young
artist to sing at an at-home, and so society may take
steps towards sending her to Europe for further educa-
tion. Sassiety, however, doesn’t show much unselfish
enthusiasm for encouraging good voices to go ’Ome and
stop there.
Nelly Farren could not be her own Maggie Moore, in
“Trilby,” and therefore dropped her coin.
The proper climax to “ Cavalleria Rusticana” (drama)
was omitted on the first night of its performance at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, and Mrs. Potter lost a rich “bit of fat”
for that occasion only. It was all there afterwards.
According to the June number of that in-
teresting little quarterly, the Scientific Austba-
lian, the Rontgen rays are being used in France
for the investigation of packages suspected of
dynamite.
Ex-Treas. Ward, in that blasting oration
with which he bade good-bye to his portfolio, told
M.L. Parliament that he had been hounded down
and ruined by his political enemies. Premier
Seddon is understood to endorse this hair-raising
statement—which is true, in a sense. Ward’s
political friends tried to hush up his dreadful
Farmers’ Association muddle, but his enemies
persisted in printing the facts and figures, a.nd
thus wrecked any chance he ever had of getting
through in the unobtrusive silence of 9d. in the £.
But if Ward hadn’t supplied the busted co. his
enemies couldn’t have exposed it. Ward says
they exposed it from low, unpatriotic, grovelling
motives, which is probably true. Also his friends
probably tried to avert the exposure from very
similar motives. Altogether the spectacle of
Ward biting promiscuously in his last moments
isn’t edifying. Better for him and them had his
colleagues smothered him privately, instead of
letting him do his final howl in the House of
Representatives.
Old bushmen have it that, if tick-stricken
cattle be taken into ant-infested country for a few
weeks, the ants soon settle the ticks, which they
deem dainty delicacies.
The Argus linotypes have chased away
the “ grass ” hands, and many “ stab ” hands
have been notified of coming ejection. The owners
intend to divide <£looo among the fired-out “ stab”
hands according to length of service. David
Syme employs his ejected comps, and their fami-
lies on his Lilydale farm.
Yic. justice. For stealing £lO4O by means
of forgery a Yic. bank-manager was sentenced to
six months’ gaol. The following week in the
same city, Geelong, a man who had
£3O straight out, without the added crime of
forgery, got twelve months’ gaol. Moral —it’s
best to be a big robber. Also, the bigger the steal
the less the gaol.
Melb. demise: A. W. Robertson, of Robert-
son & Wagner. Freeman Cobb was the founder of
the great coaching firm, and the whole system was
named after him, though not with much more
justice than America after Amerigo Vespuccius, for
Cobb retired in 1858. As the bush coaches came
first from America, so did the Melb. city ones, and
the trams. Robertson was, as much as one man
could be, the backbone of the development.
Seddon’s desperate loyalty to Ward may
yet bringhim down along with his fallen colleague.
Rigger Dick doesn’t know when to judiciously
throw a broken friend overboard. This would be
a grand occasion to clean up whatever scandals
there may be in the record of the Seddon Minis-
try, and prove that they were all done by “ the
man that’s dead,” and then the rest of the Govern-
ment could start with a beautiful white record for
the elections. But Richard of Kumara isn’t built
that way.
The fierce struggle in the dock at the Old
Bailey between Fowler and Millsom and the gaol-
warders, when the Muswell Hill murderers were
found guilty, recalls the conviction of Jenkins and
Tatterdale in Sydney Court House for the murder
of Dr. Wardell in 1834. The former jumped upon
Tatterdale, nearly strangling him ; it took six
constables to separate the men. On the scaffold,
Jenkins said that he shot the doctor because he
was a tyrant and as a warning to tyrants, and ad-
vised the convicts, who were massed to witness
the execution, to do likewise when they took to
the bush.
The common Australian tick is polyandrous
and (comparatively) unfertile. The new-fangled
Northern tick is, however, addicted to but one
husband at a time, who may be descried nestling
beneath his spouse, secure and cosy. Wondrously
fecund is she also —populating a country at very
short notice. And extremely adaptive is the
Northern tick. Finding the skin of the average
bullock made perfectly untenable by cotton-seed
oil and other hideous compounds, he bores his way
inwards, and takes up his abode in the tender
juicy beef. Thousands of ticks have been found
browsing happily in the “ innards ” of a slaugh-
tered bovine.
Butler, the M.L. recidiviste, sentenced to
12 months in Melb. the other day for being illegally
at large and committed for trial for other offences,
professed the utmost piety before his arrest. He was
living with distant relatives, who believed him to
have been in America for the last 10 years. Every
meal the discharged burglar and supposed mur-
derer would deliver a lengthy grace while the
food got cold, and he nearly became estranged
from one of his female relations owing to the
strong stand he took on finding that her children
did not attend Sunday-school !

Dear Bulletin, —You say ipecacuanha-

At Bendigo a man found guilty of stealing
nine pigs from a widow was allowed to go on his
own recogs, to come up for sentence when called
upon. It was on the same day at Numurkah that

station, as food for her sick husband and eight
hungry children, was fined £5 and costs, or gaol.
At a dinner and reception held at the

dant, however, agreed to settle £3OOO on her.
The coronation of the Czar, at Moscow,
Was embellished with considerable religious mum-
mery. When the potentate and his young wife
came to the little chapel of the Iberian Madonna
they bowed before the sacred paintings of Saints
on the outside walls and venerated the Holy relics.
Russian faith in the Ikons amounts, among the
ignorant populace, to heathen idolatry, and a
Czar who didn’t pretend to worship these ancient
daubs might be urdered on the spot.
“ There ” writes to The Bulletin :
“Yes, Wo Fat always shows himself kind to
women. He was kind to the writer’s hired girl.
After five years’ kindness she was helping to
whiten his yellow children. He was kind to the
hare-brained lady pietist who undertook a
Mongolian conversion. Trying to discourage his
opium-habit, after much disputation, she smoked
a pipe to show it could be practised, then discarded.
She smoked several other pipes afterwards, and in
a few months apparently was the unconverted but
kindly Chow’s life-partner. In Australia the rich
man defends employment of Chinese. He has
little to lose when the Chow’s victim is generally
the worker’s daughter, the shop-girl, or the
domestic servant.”
The Pope blesses the English fighting-
ships. The Archbishop of Canterbury has
solemnly blessed an ironclad, at its launch, with
sacred fizz. Form of prayer : “ Lord, we thank
Thee, for Thou art a Man of War, that Thou
hast enabled us once more to construct an engine
for despatching souls to hell by the hundred, with-
out a moment’s thought. Lord, bless this ram !
Grant that its plough-like plunge, with its sancti-
fied spur, may be such that even prayer cannot
repair.” And so on.
Many Sydney people preserve as curiosi-
ties footprints of extinct creatures found in the
sandstone at. Cockatoo. There were a few very
curious ones found in digging out the bottle-
shaped silos intended for storing wheat, but these
mostly found their way into museums and such
like. There was such demand for these that the
convicts manufactured a lot a great deal more
curious than Jhe genuine article. It is these
mostly that are displayed to wondering visitors.
The aforementioned silos were dug in the solid
rock for the purpose of storing wheat, in case of a
second famine, but the water penetrated the soft
sandstone and the whole store was destroyed.
Two men nearly lost their lives through descend-
ing the shaft and being overcome by the fumes of
the decaying mass.
There is no harborage at Norfolk Island,
and in the convict days it was usual to tell off a
squad of the best swimmers (convicts) to be ready
in case of an incoming boat upsetting in the surf.
The brig Governor Hunter, Captain Boyle, had
arrived from Sydney, among her passengers being
a civil servant, Mr. Robinson, whose dress was
not unlike a priest’s. The boat capsized in land-
ing, the ready swimmers plunged to the rescue,
and Robinson was dragged ashore safe and sound,
but with empty pockets. But his rescuer felt
horror-stricken at the thought of having robbed a
priest, and the lost valuables were mysteriously
returned to their owner same evening. Unprint-
able language was used later on when the holy
father appeared in a short coat and Panama hat.
“ Timotheus ” on high in the Argus,
gushing over Robert Harper as the man who
should be Treasurer, but isn’t, and isn’t likely to
be :
Pick out the hall-dozen men in the Assembly whom a
citizen would trust with the care of his money and of his
family, and those are the half-dozen members most re-
moved from the chance of office.
This loses effect because of everybody’s knowledge
that a few years ago the Argus, if asked to pick
that trustworthy half-dozen, would have picked
six boss boomers, and gloried in their righteous-
ness. A hundred eyes count for nothing when
they’re all blind.
The Bill for shutting out Asiatic immi-
grants was lost in M.L. Leg. Council by the
casting vote of the Speaker. Premier Seddon has
re-introduced it in the Assembly, and if it doesn’t
pass this time there is to be war. Maoriland
M’sL.C. are now appointed for seven years, but a
lot of the old life-members haven’t yet died off,
and they constitute the obstructive element.
Seddon threatens a measure to shift these ancient
fossils at once, and as the fossils probably won’t
pass the Bill for their own extinction, there is just
a chance that the Council has supplied Digger
Dick with a first-class war-whoop for the approach-
ing elections.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Betting on the Stanbury-Harding match must
have been very limited, one supposes. It seems incredible
that the Britishers, quite accustomed to the defeat of
their professional scullers, could back Harding, at even
money, against a5O per cent, heavier man. By the way,
The Bulletin has a good mind to give a prize one of
these days for competition among Thames and Tyne
scullers—with the object of encouraging sculling in Aus-
tralia.

Stanbury has challenged Jacob Gaudaur to row
for the championship of the world and £lOOO a-side either
on Thames or Parramatta. Jacob Gaudaur ! Good old
Jacob ! We are 90 now, and we went to school with him
when we were a boy.
* * * *
Gaudaur’s refusal to row on the Thames or Parra-
matta is characteristic of the Canadian. Stanbury would
have a nice chance of winning at Vancouver if a miscel-
laneous assortment of tug-boats took part in the race.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —Last week you have a par. as
to alleged “drugging” of the Maoriland rowing-repre-
sentatives, and you inquire what the crew themselves
have to say about it, and opine that this statement in a
Marlborough paper is very bad from a beaten team. The
M.L. crew when here never attributed its defeat to this
incident, and I am far from believing that they do so now.
The occurrence happened over a week before the race, and
was known at the time to three men in Sydney beside the
crew —two pressmen and a prominent rowing - official.
After consultation with the crew it was decided that, as
nothing could be proved, nothing should be said of the
matter, and so all knowledge of it was suppressed. The
crew did not mention it as affecting the race, and its
drifting into a Marlborough paper must have been through
some casual remark. The affair occurred in the city of
Sydney, not at the crew’s rowing - quarters.

Stanbury never rowed on Sunday when training
for his match. The river was too full of boats. The
champion fixed on long buggy-drives as a substitute,
engaging two of the hardest “ pullers ” procurable in order
to give his arms some work. Stanburv’s shell weighed
301 b. ; Harding’s 101 b. less.

The news of Trott winning the toss grew so
monotonous that Melb. Argus opened its tale of the
match against Lancashire with, “The Australians com-
menced batting.”
* * * *
Apropos the offer of <£365 a year and quarters,
made by Sussex County Club to Ernest Jones : Ferris re-
ceived £3OO a year, and a house rent-free, from Gloucester.
S. A. Cricket ing Association cabled when too late to engage
Jones as an Adelaide Oval ground-bowler, at £2OO a year.
*-* * *
The cricket-ground at Brammal Lane, Sheffield,
gossips an Australian abroad to The Bulletin, is notori-
ously the worst bit of turf in England. Hirst and Jones
were absolutely dangerous to batsmen in the Australians
v. Yorkshire match, and the Broken Hill man had seven
of the county men writhing on the ground at different
times. Donnan’s hands were knocked about so badly that
it was all he could do to play in the Lancashire match,
and he was obliged to take a rest at Oxford. When Peel'
returned to the pavilion after being bowled first ball, a
sympathiser remarked, “ Well, you’re soon out, old man.”
“ Aye,” replied Bobby, “ and d d glad too.”
“ The English press does not relish the decisive
opening victories of Australia. The opinion was freely
expressed t.hat Yorkshire would beat them, and critics
were obliged to fall back on the excuse that ‘ funk ’ of
Jones was the reason of the defeat of that county,
although Giffen got most of the wickets.
“ There are two or three very careful men in the
Australian XI., and one is reputed to have so far only
spent a sovereign since he left Down Under. The manager,
of course, settles all expenses of living and travelling
down to the veriest details, so that a completely mean
man need not really spend a shilling out of his pocket on
the entire trip.
“ Gregory, though complaining of feeling much
‘ off-color ’ from cold before going in for his innings at
Manchester, batted in his best style when once there, and
made his runs by most energetic'hitting. Strange to say,
Trumble, too, complained Of being far from well on the
day he bowled so well against Oxford University, taking
6 wickets for 17 runs.
“ The Australian team are flooded with social
invitations from all sorts and conditions, and it is easy to
understand how, when flushed with victory and flattered
by hangers-on, other elevens have gone on a spree. The
present lot have fortunately a few steady-going members
that nothing can tempt astray, and these ‘ leaven the
whole.’ But some there are who will want a lot of leaven-
ing and watching to get through as well as they have so
far. Even now it is not such a serious earnest set of men
as it was on arrival.”
* * * *
The story is told that on the occasion of the big
England v. Australia match at Lord’s in 1891 a certain
Australian cricketer, then playing for his native land, was
approached by the Prince of Wales as he left the pavilion.
“Well, ,” said H.R.H. genially, as the crowd
grouped themselves around to form an historical tableau,
“ I wish you luck. ■ How do you feel?” “Oh,” replied
, with a confident grin, swinging his bat on to the
turf, “I ain’t too blanky stinking.”
* * * *
All-England Eleven in the last test-match was
seemingly adapted to the very pardonable expectation
that Grace would win the toss, leaving the Australians to
get the worst of unsettled weather. But Trott’s luck still
stuck to him. The Australians went first to bat bn a hard
wicket, and then the mistake of putting Briggs alone into
the bowling-gap left by the two Surrey men—Lohmann
and Hayward—must have set the Manchester crowd curs-
ing in choice Lancashire dialect. Had Grace won the
toss, the batting strength of the home team, with Mac-
laren and Ranjitsinghi replacing Lohmann and Gunn,
would have been played for all it was worth. Given first
innings, on a good wicket, such a collection of strikers
can’t very well get beaten in a three-days’ match. The
other side might make a draw of the game—even a draw
in their favor—but a win would be almost out of the
question.
* * * *
The true history of the second test-match is
somewhat as follows. The Australians, by carrying their
first innings well into the second day, compelled the
Englishmen to attempt a rather faster game than usual,
with the result that they lost 14 wickets for 340 runs in
about two hours less time (allowing for two intervals
between innings) than our men took for making 366 runs
for eight wickets on the first day. These figures, con-
sidering that Grace & Co. never got the bowling collared,
and were subject to six more waits for incoming batsmen
(say another 20 minutes loss of time) than the Australians'
had on the first day, indicate that their play was rather
reckless. Again on the third day the Englishmen
in genera], and their coloured ally, Ranji, in
particular, were bound to play fast to give
themselves a chance of winning, so they made
things lively again. This put the Australians in
the predicament of having to play pretty freely to pre-
vent a draw, and when they sacrificed some of their cau-
tion they got out—seven of them—pretty rapidly. To
argue that the Englishmen would have been got rid of for
231 in their first innings if they had won the toss is
absurd. They would then have tried to set the other
fellows a big score to beat within a given time, and the
other fellows would have played steadily for a draw, so
steadily, perhaps, as to bring themselves to grief.

The movement to present a testimonial to
bowler Turner has been favorably commented on in the
English press. In Yorkshire particularly the matter has
been taken up with enthusiasm, and Lord Harris and
other notable figures in English cricket have eulogised the
object of the movement and subscribed liberally to the
fund.

Public appreciation of Galway’s extraordinary
win at Caulfield last Saturday was all the greater because
the horse fell at one of the three jumps - the middle one
—opposite the grand-stand. Jockey Smith was tumul-
tuously cheered in the first instance for his smartness in
getting back to the saddle and taking Galway over the
next obstacle before he had recovered the use of his
stirrup-irons. Thereafter the crowd had very few eyes
for anything but the favorite, and when at last the lee-
way was made up, and Galway beat them all in the
straight run home, the shouting did justice to the occa-
sion. Even Ikey Mo roared approval along with the
lucky punters who were about to draw his coin. Every
man on the course contributed to the noise, and nearly
every woman waved her handkerchief, or brandished a
race-card.

At Cooktown, the other day, two horses were

The disinclination of sweep people to submit to
blackmailing caused 18 Canterbury Handicap horses to be
struck out on Saturday. Backers fell heavily on Valiant
and other last-minute-fancies, Messmate settinga winning
pace all the way. The interference Gozo’s son had met in
his races latterly induced Gough to try field-leading
tactics this time with success. Short-of-work Valiant
gave 14b. and two years to the victor and raced a good
second under the circs.

Man of Honor, who cantered over The Officer
at Caulfield on Saturday, is half-brother to Freedom, a
top-notch M.L. money-winner for Dan O’Brien. A 231 b
concession by The Officer may have given him the race,
but his easy win will cause serious consideration of his
Derby prospects. When he won his first race recently,
Man of Honor wasn’t backed for a cent., and Redfearn
didn’t enter him for the Cups.
Twenty-eight outside mares at 200 gs. each, and

City tote and double-layers fatten extensively
on stay-at-home punters who can’t afford a late wire

fancied picks. Laying ’em for cash is a profitable biz.

V.A.T.C. National first acceptances disclose a
representative lot, but the absent Maorilanders were ap-
parently left in by mistake. Some tender-legged neddies,
in the hospital since Flemington, still grace the lists, so
the ring has no cause for complaint. Manifold’s double,
Dungan and Waterloo, is now a short-price pick.
Weight of public opinion has made the danger-
ous, well-bred Marusa favourite for Caulfield Cup.
Though five years old, he has not yet won, his best runs
being second to Cobbity in Caulfield Guineas, and third
in a Toorak Handicap.
* * * *
Examine the quality of a really successful
paper “ tip ” for the G.N. Steeplechase in Melbourne : “ I
expect whatever beats J. 0.1. to win, with a reservation in
favor of Dungan should he go to the post. I place as
follows—J.O.l. or Dungan 1; Taylor’s best 2 ; Miller’s
elect 3.” Dungan did go to the post and win, also one of
Taylor’s finished third. But neither Taylor nor Miller
had a best, or elect, in their respective pairs of candidates.
So, on the principle that anything good enough to get a
place is good enough to win, a punter would need to hack
six horses on the “ tip.” This, apart from the absurdity of
selecting two horses for the first place, and another" for
the second place, is a common newspaper practice.
The metropolitan - country Rugby match at
Sydney ranks first on the season’s record for scientific
and almost perfect play. The rural kickers weren’t as
green as their jerseys indicated, and astonished an appre-
ciative crowd. Splendid passing, dashing rushes, and
fine kicking furnished an attractive display. The first
spe Iwas 5 to 3 in favor of the cityites, whose superior
trickiness in the last term landed a23to 8 victory. The
extremely fast play winded the referee, who called the
ball “ dead” and lay down to pick up some stray air.

Leading Rugby men now see that wing forwards
are really not wanted. Yet no attempt is made to abolish
them. The “ wing” is about as foolish as the four three-
quarters system.
Melbourne Rugby is now practically dead. Its
recent revival, after all, was only the last splutter of the
expiring flame. Though promising really to catch on
the men who could have engineered its popularity, when
most wanted, left Victoria, got married, and otherwise
disappeared. The valuable Nash trophy is either to be
melted down or returned to the donor, and most of the
players have decided trying the almost moribund Asso-
ciation game.

Saturday’s Melb. football leaves Collingwood
and Essendon (who stood out of the contests) exactly
level on the premiership list. Collingwood beat Footscray
7g. sb. to 4g. 5b., mainly by establishing a three goals’’
lead in the first quarter. Collingwoods play hard from
beginning to end, finish like lions, and should make a
very hot game with Essendon when they meet in Aug.
S. Melb. men are much improved since being defeated by
the two leading clubs, and their Carlton win on Saturday
promises the infusion of new life into the premiership
struggle. The best football of the day was provided in
the St. Kilda v. Port Melb. match, where the erratic but
brilliant “ aristocrats ” were downed 6 goals to 3 goals.

Translation from a Chinese report (supplied to
the Sydney Chinese paper by Mr. James Lee Chung, of
Ballarat) of a local Chinese charity football - match :
There was a European band and a Chinese band at the
match. The gardeners, who were all full-blooded Chinese,
wore white jumpers, and the miners wore blue jumpers.
Some of these were half-castes. The umpire wore Chinese
slippers, but the players wore boots. The gardeners got
the first score, but some of their pig-tails came down
and the half-castes pulled them. This was wrong,
because the half - castes should have remembered
that their fathers were Chinese. This caused a
disturbance, because Yet Way’s pig-tail was pulled
too hard. While the gardeners were shaking hands
because they had got a score the miners kicked a goal and
the gardeners were angry, but the miners then kicked
another goal, and when the game was - over the miners
had won by four goals to three goals. The gardeners’
captain should not have smoked cigarettes while he was
playing. Mr. J. Lee Chung, the treasurer, was at the
match in white clothes, blue sash, and a smoking-cap.
The match realised £l3O for the charities.

People who spend ss. on a full, ticket in a more

that there is an equal chance, comparatively speaking, of
netting a big return in Tatt.’s sweeps lor the same money.

A bailiff recently seized a country horse previous
to the race it was engaged in, but was outwitted by the

Reminiscent of an incident in M. L. many years ago. The
bailiff’s instructions were not to let the horse start. But
he relented at the instance of the tearful owner, who said
the prad would either win or bust. Mr. Bailiff put a
pound on, and had the mortification of seeing his horse

choice, I should never wear a skirt for cycling a>>ain.

way, than the skirt; with the former, you see everything

Somebody has started a bitter cry in the;
Smellbourne press against the wretched quality of
kerosene sold by local grocers. It is indeed bad

“ British operations against the Mata-
bele,” as reported in the Cape Times, make plea-
sant reading from the essentially British stand-
point. The unspeakable heathen is being chased,
cannonaded, cut up, and generally dismembered
with great glee and glory. The account of the
latest ‘ ‘ Battle near Bulawayo ” states that—
After firing one volley the rebels fled, and the whole
column chased them four miles until their horses were
knocked up, and the rebels were scattered. We killed
from 200 to 250. [British casualties numbered three —
none serious.] . . . We then charged into the enemy,
killing upwards of 300, the rebels flying in all directions,
many trying to hide in the long grass and bush, and some
climbing trees. Many were shot down like partridges.
. . . Their speedy flight is much regretted, as every-
thing was planned splendidly for a decisive engagement.
. . . Yesterday was spent in a fruitless chase after the
rebels, who were running for dear life. . . . There
was no display of bravery on the part of the rebels. It is
generally believed that they will never make a real.stand.
Our men speak of the engagements as “ a hunt,” and
came back to dinner after a few hours’ absence.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
The resourcefulness of the Western (N.S.
Wales) squatter when making an ad misericordiam
appeal for rent-reduction, was illustrated the other

that his holding was over-run by pigs.
The Epidemic Spreading.
There are to-day more than a thousand developed
cases of this dread malady, Bright’s Disease, in
Australia ; and, in spite of the untiring efforts of
physicians, this scourge is spreading with alarming
rapidity, threatening every home. With many,
the first symptom of alarm is that dreadful “swel-
ling,” which comes unannounced in the feet,
hands, under the eyelids or in the throat. Others
suffer with dull, indefinite pains in the various
parts of the body, and feel unaccountably weary,
feverish, have loss of appetite, and general feelings
of melancholy. These simple symptoms are the first
indications of Bright’s Disease of the Kidneys,
which, unless promptly checked, are certain to
result in serious illness or death. A short time
IN THE HOSPITAL,
in the city of Ballarat, an old resident, and highly
esteemed citizen of that city, lay rapidly sinking,
struggling in the toils of this dread monster—
Bright’s Disease. In spite of the best treatment
they could suggest, the dropsical swelling was
rapidly increasing. With the usual profound
shaking of the head, the deprecatory shrug of the
shoulder, the uplifting of the eye-brows, which to
the poor patient means a sentence of death, they
recommended the removal of one kidney as a last
resort. What a dismal return to the home fireside.
Could nothing be done to save ? Is there no help
for victims of kidney disease ? Must he give up ?
—No ; he remembered that Warner’s “ Safe ”
Cure had cured others, why not him? He im-
mediately commenced using it. and the result is
given below in his own words :
“ While working in a mine near Ballarat my
back suddenly gave way, with a report something
like that of a pistol, and I was assisted home. In
place of water, pure blood commenced to pass
from me. I first used simple remedies ; then at-
tended the hospital as an out patient. The doc-
tors diagnosed Bright’s disease of the kidneys,
and, getting no better, I then became an in-patient
for five weeks. Rapidly failing, a consultation of
six doctors was held which resulted in their recom-
mending an operation to remove one of my kid-
neys. To this I objected, and left the hospital
worse than when I had entered it.
“ Although I derided the idea, my wife, acting
upon the earnest recommendation of a neighbour,
sent for a bottle of Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure, and, by
the time it was used, my water was clear ; im-
provement was uninterrupted, sixteen bottles
cured and actually enabled me to resume work.
This was five years ago, and I have not lost a
day’s work through illness since nor felt the
slightest symptom of my old complaint. Why,
the doctors whom I have met since expressed sur-
prise that I was living. My case was well known
in Ballarat, and the health which I now enjoy
after such a tedious and serious illness, is quite
sufficient to make me very grateful, and for that,
and for no other reasons, I give this testimonial.”*

A fantastic phantom-horse yarn comes from
Maoriland, where it has oft been heard before, but never
told abroad. Two jocks., schooling hurdlers beyond Wai-
pawa (Hawkes Bay), once crashed on a fence, and both
riders and horses were killed. Every anniversary (June
13), at the exact time of day, shadowy jocks, mounted on
shadowy horses (visible) line up, rumble along, take their
hurdles, moan, and disappear. Last month a photo-
grapher went out with a party and took a shot, the de-
velopment showing the phantom, and through it the
spectators on the other side. One thing about this appa-
rition, anyway, is that it happens in broad daylight in-
stead of at night, and people don’t have to say their
prayers. If Shadowland runs its own little stables, it’s a
wonder other jocks, killed whilst riding don’t go through
similar annual performances. But perhaps there aren’t
enough neddies to go round.

There is much misapprehension re the use of
loaded dice, an expert told a Bulletin man the other day.
They are never made nowadays to throw high—the safe
“joey” turns up low every time. Moreover, it is used
both by the “talent” and by the mugs—once it is rung
in it stays there till the game is over. In fly-flat circles it
is believed that the cronk “ tat ” is rung in and rung out
by the expert. But this is hovv it is worked The “ joey ”
having been introduced, say in a flutter at Yankee-grab,
there are two square tats and one cronk one, aren’t there ?
Well, the mug takes his three throws, and the “joey
turns up “one” every time, so that he can’t throw more
than 13 to save his soul. The expert just swaps the joey,
say at his second throw, for one of the square tats, arid-
well, it’s 2tol on him every time that he beats 13. The
loading of the tats is done with dentist’s-gold, and the
best of them used to be made by a man in Maoriland,
who afterwards became an evangelist.

A queer Melb. identity is the old fellow
With the big military moustache and a sort of
cockade on his chest, who hangs around the
theatre-entrances at closing-times and acts as
carriage-caller for the aristocracy. Originally a
butt for small boys’ridicule, this unattached flun-
key has come to be regarded with awe. Standing
at the doorway of any place of entertainment,
he is the visible sign of a sassiety gathering
within. The great have him on duty when they
give a ball or garden-party, and the business-cards
which he carries in his ulster-pocket proclaim him
carriage-attendant by special appointment to the
flight Hon. Lord Brassey, K. 0.8. Four years
ago the old fellow happened to be standing outside
the Masonic Hall, one dance-night, when a gent,
gave him the number of a cab and asked him to
call it up. Which he did and pocketed a half-
crown tip for his pains. From that eventful night
the old warrior dates the beginning of his unique
career. The face of his first patron and the number
of the cab that he fetched from the rank are photo-
graphed on his immortal soul. His own weather-
beaten phiz, and aggressive mb. must be almost as
familiar to people as the serene countenance of
tall Turner, who guards the dress-circle door at
the Princess’s and watches over the members’

The Bulletin receives a pamphlet con-
taining an eloquent addresson “Commerce’' by the
silver-tongued Colonel Bell, U.S. consul at Sydney.
I his paper has a certain admiration for the
elocutionary aspect of the U.S. consul, but it
doesn t fully appreciate either his facts or his logic
or his reverence for the great art of buying and
selling. He speaks of the ancient Mexicans as
communists, like the old Peruvians, and talks of
the ease with which they were swept out
of existence;” and when one reads the
history of those grim old Aztec fighters who hung
on with their teeth to the enemy’s throat
until the very last act, and who are not “ swept
out of existence ” to this day, one feels that the
Colonel doesn’t know his own continent. Also,
the Colonel includes the Mexicans among South
Americans, which reads very strangely. Later,
tie says: “ Show me the records of trade, and I
will give you the wages of the people, the style of
their habitations, the character of their clothps,
the degree in which they are educated, and how
low they bow in the presence of some local booby
who was accidentally born silver-tipped.” On
e v stimate ’ Holland should be twice as free and
enlightened and progressive as any other place on
tins earth, barring Hong Kong, and Singapore,
but somehow it isn’t; and the United States
should be far poorer and more grovelsome
than Belgium, Holland, France, Britain,
Germany, Australia, Singapore, or Hong Korin 1
whic h is rough on the Colonel. He also points
out that Russia’s small external trade is a proof of
barbarism, and that the small external trade of the
U.S. isn t, because her vast inland commerce
should also be considered. The vast inland com-
merce of Russia apparently doesn’t need to be con-
sidered. Altogether the eloquent Colonel’s rever-
ence for trade leads him into a lot of curious
bye-ways, which even the pleasant flow of his
beautiful language can’t wholly excuse.

(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

To Herb Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a %-ery
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. “You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E,
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY,
Witness : Edward Hardy, proprietor Town-

Sir,- —I hereby beg to certify that having been
a sufferer from General De.biiitv of the Nervous

without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,

Several different theories have been ad-
vanced to account for the late suicidal epidemic
in Sydney. The real cause :
They had to choose ’twixt Freetrade' Reid
And suicide ;
They went and out their throats with speed—
And so they died.
On May 23 Sydney Daily Telegraph
printed a letter addressed to Mr. J. Tighe Ryan,
signed Charles Lilley, and dated Brisbane, sth
May, 1896, dealing with Australia’s relations to
Britain. Interviewed on May 26 by Brisbane
Courier the Q. ex-Chief-Justice was reported to
113. VG said i
The communication which Mr. Ryan had handed to our
lenpr ey hMf n " P °? wa f’ he stated > not one consecutive
letter, but a compilation from several letters which he had
written to Mr Ryan. He did not find fault with its pub
lioation, nor to any extent with its contents, but our
representative gathered that it did not embody all the
points which he had dealt with. Mr. Ryan’s communica-
tion was apparently a free condensation of his letters.
Apparently neither the Courier nor the ex-Chief
J ustice altered or contradicted this statement, and
the following paragraph appeared in Bulletin of
J une 6 :
lett;r e tn° « ie Mv J U StlCe i> Lille y. he write that
lettei to My dear Ryan. He wrote several letters,

apparentPwhoeie t 0 the Sydney P™« as an
Mr. Ryan complains that this is “absolutely
false ; and this paper, which Las no desire to
misrepresent Mr. Ryan or anybody else, referred
to his distinguished correspondent, who states that
he was and is still under the impression that the
original letter was a compilation from two or three
letters written by him ; that there was more in
the letters written to Mr. Ryan than the latter
P u J‘l s ie 7, but that he has no reason to complain
and Mr. Ryan acted with perfect honesty on his
unconditional leave both as to the matter and
form of publication This sets the affair in a
different light from that of the original statement,
and Ihe Bulletin accordingly’publishes it as a
matter of justice, m order that Mr. Ryan’s posi-
tion may be made perfectly clear; regretting- if
under the circumstances, his conduct as a jour-
nalist may have been the subject of any uninten-
tional misrepresentation.
Vic. Full Court has again sat down with a
well-earned thud on Chief-Justice Madden. The
case was as follows: The Railway Department ap-
a gatekeeper. The latter deputed a small
child to open the gates instead of doing it herself •
an accident ensued, and an action for damages. Mr.’
Madden held that the department wasn’t respon-
sible because the negligence was not committed by
its servant, but by her unauthorised deputy; if it
had been the servant’s own negligence, it would
have been responsible. The Full Court holds that
not attending to her work, and leaving an un-
authorised small child to do it, was negligence
and expresses mild surprise that its learned brother
Madden couldn’t understand a little thing like
that. Madden is the most absolutely hopeless
C. J. m Australasia just now. Still, even he has
his uses When there are three alternatives, his
decision that one is right narrows the field of dis-
cussion by making it practically certain that the
correct thing must be one of the other two. But
contraries?* cll3aper to let his decisions go by
Dear Bulletin, —If you were negotiating
for a lease of new premises would you think it
square to have to pay a year’s rent in advance, and
then wait from eight to twelve months before you
eould use the building owing to your landlord’s
dilatoriness? I don t think many people are built
that way. Yet that is what the young man who
gee i on the land in N.S.W. has frequently to put
up with. I know men who applied for C.P. and
0.8. land six months ago, yet the date of their
preliminary exam, is not even fixed yet which
means that it will be at least a year before their
selections will be surveyed and confirmed. Mean-
while, the squatters are crowding thousands of
sheep on to the land applied for so as to eat it
bare. These selections are withdrawn from the
squatter’s lease on the day the applications are
lodged. So the selector pays for a year’s grass for
the squatter’s sheep, and, when his selection is
confirmed, he has to wait until spring-time fetches
the grass up again before he can stock his run.
The remedy. Hent to commence from date of
confirmation, instead of application. The delay
in getting settled on the land is quite exasperating
enough without having to pay for it. This is only
one grievance. It cannot be repeated too often":

THEIR CRITICISM.
SYKES: “Say, Bill, dat ‘Charlotte Cor day ’
is a great play. A young gal rushes in
an stabs the villain in a bath tub.”
BILL: “ Well, that’s wot he got for washin'
hissdf.”
SIZE AND STRENGTH NO DEFENCE .
Here’s a point for you to think over: Size and
development have . nothing to do with health. A
man may stand six feet two inches in his stockings
and have the muscles of a prize fighter, and yet be
an essentially unhealthy man. His frail-looking
wife may be really the better of .the couple; shf
may easily do more work, endure more exposure
bear more grief and worry, and outlive her big
husband. Ihereis a mystery in this that nobody
can see into. It is a matter of vitality and organi-
sation—not of dimensions.
Take, for example, the case of Mr. T. B. Staples
of Oakwood, Ont. He is a blacksmith ; and I
well remember how, when a boy, I used to regard
a blacksmith with awe and wonder on account of
his strength. It was fearsome to see him swing
those mighty hammers and pick up a heavy cart-
wheel as though it were a child’s hoop. Yet I saw
only m part and understood in part.
“ Some twelve years ago,” writes Mr. Staples
I became aware that the dreadful disease, dys-
pepsia, had chosen me for one of its many victims
ii: s ; i h ( f dly i n ; c t ssary or me to tr y to describe ali
the different feelings that came over me. I have
talked with many people suffering with dvspensia
and they have all had about the same experience’
Among the symptoms on which we agreed are the
following : Bad taste m the mouth ; fullness and
deadness in the stomach after eating ; getting no
good from one’s food ; headache and palpitation of
the heart; gas and sour fluids from the stomach •
dizziness, especially when one rises up suddenly’
He b nh?t OVei i w® r rk !?™ 0f a PP e *ite ; pains in
the chest and back, and the weakness that comes
from not eating and digesting enough food to keep
the body going. All these things I" had ; and you
can imagine how bad they are for any one ; par-
ticularly for a man who has got to earn his living
by daily hard work, as in my case. °
“After I found out what was the matter with
me I consulted a doctor at once, and began to
I ?. ed I lcme he gave me. lam sorry to say
it did me little or no good. Although there is a
common opinion that stomach troubles are not
very serious, and never dangerous, I must say
that is not my opinion. No man who suffers from
dyspepsia as long as I did (about six years) will
ever talk foolishly or lightly about it. "' Even the
doctors admit it is the hardest of all diseases to
keep track of and to cure. If it does not kill a
man right out of hand, it spreads the shadow of
death over him all the time he has it, and takes all
the laughter out of his days.
“Well, after the doctor’s medicine failed I kept
on taking anything and everything that was
recommended to me in hopes of relief. Yet none
of them went to the root of the trouble. Some-
times I would feel a little better and sometimes
worse, and that’s the way things went on with me
year after year, a dreary and miserable time
I here s no money could hire me to live it over
again.
I was still in this condiiton when a friend that
I had been talking to about myself, advised me to
try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. I didn’t
know the merits of the Syrup then, but being
anxious to try anything that might help me I
bought a bottle from Messrs. Hogg Brothers and
commenced taking it. All I can say is, that I
found relief immediately, and by continuing with
it a short time, all my bad symptoms abated one
by one, and I found myself con pi ;tely rid of the
dyspepsia. Since then I have never had a touch
of the old complaint. If there is any other medi-
cine in the world that is able to cure indigestion
and dyspepsia as Mother Seigel’s Syrup does it
why I have never heard of it. I have recom-
mended the Syrup to other sufferers, and they
have been more than pleased with it; and I write
these hasty lines in hope the publication of them
may come in the nick of time to be useful to
others still. Yours very truly (Signed) Thos. B.
staples, Oakwood, Ontario, February 25th, 1895. ”
We need add but few words to Mr. Staples’
nAeUigent and manly letter. The disease which
afflicted him attacks both sexes, all ages, and all
classes and conditions of humanity. Neither
youth nor strength is proof against it. It imitates
other complaints, and so leads to fatal mistakes in
treatment. If you are wise you will acquaint
yourself with its character, as described in Mother
Seigel s almanac, and know what to do in time
of need.

The serum of the blood of an ordinary
healthy horse has lately been found by a. Barcelona
doctor to act as a most powerful tonic, fornall
doses injected into weak children daily for three
or four weeks made the red corpuscles of the
blood rapidly increase in number; weight was
gained, and the children visibly became stronger.
Sixteen cases of St. Vitus dance were thus cured
in, on an average, fifteen days. For this reason,
if for no other, horses will not be allowed to die
out in the epoch of bicycles and motor cars. |
A leading Paris doctor has been trying to
demonstrate, and with some success, that the usual
way of sleeping with pillows under the head, and
the head higher than the feet, is all wrong. His
argument is that the head should be level with or
lower than the feet, and that, if pillows must be used,
they should be put under the feet. He claims that
this is a sure cure for insomnia and a great relief
for sufferers from lung and kidney troubles. lhe
present writer, who has suffered much from in-
somnia, has during the last year always found it
easier to get to sleep by throwing the pillows over-
board and lying curled up on the right side with
the head resting only on the upper arm.

The despatch by the Salisbury Government
of an Egyptian army to commence the re-conquest
Of the Soudan, calls up memories of that other
Egyptian army, with which Hicks started on the
same errand some ten years ago. It was probably
the most wonderful army that has been, seen this
century outside China. The officers included a
few Turks, Americans, British, Irench and
Italians, and there were one or two hundred
Turkish soldiers to stiffen the great limp mass.
The rest were mainly raw Egyptian peasants just
dragged from their fields. They had never seen a
battle and many of them didn’t know what such a
thing meant. Some of them had never even seen
a gun until they were started on this gruesome
expedition, and when they got away into a strange
land that looked quite unlike Egypt they lost
heart, and wept and prayed and gave way to
panics and stampedes. For months this awful
army lumbered further and further into the desert,
the officers and the Turkish soldiers rounding up
the great, sheep-like mass, flogging and cursing it
onwards, men trailing the guns along by hand
because the horses, were mostly dead, dragging
sick camels and cart-loads of sick soldiers—mostly
sick from broken hearts —and busted shoddy
waggons, and a sound of wailing and lamen-
tation went up from the disjointed array that
made it seem more like a penitential procession
than a military expedition. The army carried the
plague along with it and a cloud of vultures kept
pace with it overhead, and the officers exhorted
their mob of alleged troops to keep up their hearts,
and executed a few now and then to encourage the
others. Presumably, Hicks and his officers knew
they were committing plain, unadorned suicide,
but they trailed wretchedly onward none the less.
When they struck the Mahdi’s army near El
Obeid the'Egyptian force collapsed almost on the
instant like a thunderblasted blanc-mange. Before
the fighting had lasted half-an-hour niost ot it
started to run for Egypt, a thousand miles or so
away, and the business was practically ended.
The European and American officers, the lurkish
soldiery and the few negro troops, fought to the
end and died unanimously m one picturesque
heap; and the rest was hard running and massacre.
There are a lot of pleasant things for the new
army to think of as it plods into the desert where
Hicks and his friends went a few years ago and
didn’t come back.

Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
T
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased bv fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple m con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

Parson Milne, of Sydney, Agrippa-like, is
almost persuaded that the abolition of capital
punishment would be a good thing, but hobbles
his soul to the strangulating present with oracu-
larisms, thus :
Only when the Spirit of the Cross animates more the
life, bringing men to acknowledge the beauty of holiness
and the glory of self-sacrifice, only then will the com-
munity be ethically prepared for the abolition of capital
punishment.
Only then will they need no laws, no penalties,
no police; for only then will they all be good.
Only then there will be no community at all;
because, only then, man will be extinct. Theol-
ogical logic is a vapor.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
23 of this issue.*
In an Eastern township, recently, they
formed a syndicate to speculate in gold-shares.
Early purchases panned out well, and eventually
the secretary, a church deacon of irreproachable
character, was sent west to buy a mine. This was
in Aug. last, but since his departure no news has
come to hand. Rumours, however, are afloat that
the sec. was in Melb. in April last in the company
of a lady, and the articles of association only refer
to golden mines and not to gold-washed hair.
The passing over of Dean Cowper time
after time when the Sydney bishopric became
vacant is attributed, and with abundant reason,
to the prejudice which until yesterday existed in
English ecclesiastical circles against elevating an
Australian native to episcopal office. Broughton,
Barker, Barry, Smith—Cowper preceded the lot,
and at every vacancy was put forward by friends
as in every way eligible, but was invariably and
without apology coldly passed over. The theory
of the English authorities has all along been that
unity is best secured by filling the chief office from
the centre of the Service.

THE BALLAD OF THE BROKER’S BOY.
(A MELBOURNE YARN)
He was a broker’s office-boy, and only ten years old;
His eyes were blue, his suit was too, his hair was gleaming
gold.
His little name was Willie, and his little face was mild.
He looked, in short, an innocent if meditative child.
There was not on his marble brow nor in his limpid eye
A furrowed line or doubtful sign his parents could descry,
To lead them to suspect a gambler’s weaknesses in Will,
None thought (apart from leap-frog) he would stoop to
back a Bill.
Will went, of course, to Sunday-school, and patiently
would sit
Whilst taught that speculation led directly to the Pit.
The teacher saw his look of awe, and ventured to condole,
But did not think the iron could have entered Willie’s
soul.
The poor boy bore up bravely, but, alas ! as time went by
His cheek grew pale, his body frail, and dim his gentle
e .ve.
He gave no thought to marbles, and for tops he didn’t
care,
And threads of silver mingled with the gold of Willie’s
hair.
He never smiled, but mooned about a prey to secret pain,
And was often seen of evenings, when his mates were
raising Cain,
Enthroned alone upon a stone, and there he’d sit till late,
Engaged in adding endless sums of money on a slate.
But subterfuge was useless, and there came an awful
crash,
And the city was excited, and the city men said “ Dash !”
Along the wires the tidings went, they passed from
tongue to tongue,
And all men knew the story true—Bing’s office-boy was
bung.
Willie tried to go insolvent. Lawyers badgered him and
swore.
No word he said, but bowed his head, and all their anger
bore.
To Banks, Associations, and Societies a score
He owed a heap for calls—he had a ton of shares or more.
Little Willie’s liabilities told up in figures round
To two million seven hundred and eleven thousand pound,
And they counted up his assets, and the creditors looked
glum
At a piece of string, a parrot’s wing, and a hunk of chewing-
gum.

The fall in interest which is making things so
bad for the banks and building and insurance societies of
Australia isn’t unprecedented, even in this country. In
1894, for example, the A.M.P. Society only realised 5.60
per cent, on its funds, which was then regarded by many
as the lowest on record. But 1872, ’73 and ’75 were all
worse. In 1873 the interest earned was only 5.13 per
cent. The record year, however, for utter badness, since
the society got fairly started, was 1854, when the funds
only returned 4J per cent. Interest on bank deposits
averaged 4 per cent, in ’62 and ’69; from ’74 to ’7B it
averaged only 3|, and it was only a shade above 3 per
cent, in ’Bl. There have been a good many lean years in
Australia—almost as lean as the three just passed, bad as
they have been

Dear Bulletin, —“Nothing has come down ”
in price under the Freetrade regime of N.S.W., “toany
serious extent by way of compensation, save Brussels
carpet and jewellery,” say you. Touching that same
Sydney “ jewellery.” There is not a bigger, more wide-
spread, more unblushing fraud than the sham and
“ brummy ” jewellery offered for sale in Sydney, and by
hawkers all over the province—and beyond its borders.
I know a man who went to a wholesale Sydney house and
bought 20doz. mixed “ gold” rings and “ gold ” brooches
for £l4—that is, 14s. a dozen! He paid £1 deposit,
balance “ on terms.” He went straight away to the
Syrian crowd of hawkers in Redfern and sold them this
lovely rubbish for £3O or 30s. a dozen. Those Syrians
wandered over the country, and disposed of their
jewellery, ring by ring and brooch by brooch, at whatever
they could get for each, from ss. up to 305.! All gold, 9to 18
carat gold, of course ! There is no such protection in
N.S.W. as “hall’’-mark. The London “hall’’-mark is
impudently imitated. I was acquainted with a brilliant
working-jeweller, who was an adept in all branches of his
trade, a first-class lapidary, a wonderful designer, moulder
and engraver, and a champion alloyer. He became (as
warranted by his undoubted talents) a daring “ fence.”
Take him a stolen chronometer. He would buy it and
ask no questions. In a twinkling the inscribed cases
would be off, the “jewels” would betaken out and others
substituted, the “number” would be altered, the very
flourishes and even initials and names would sometimes
be marvellously varied. Within an hour or two the
article would be another watch altogether from that in
the “ stolen-property list,” and anybody could safely pre-
sent it to the “Mount of Piety.” Why, onetime, for a
wager, this artist somehow inserted a plug of lead and
copper inside a gold nugget and passed it off on one of
the smartest Sydney Hebrew “uncles” as solid gold!
But what I started to remark was that Sydney jewellery
is a suspicious quantity and of suspicious quality, and
some sort of legislation is needed to protect the glitter-
loving public from frauds in this line. —Yours, The D.
The downward movement of property in N.S.W.
has been very marked of late. From ’9l to ’94 the value
of lands and improvements in Sydney decreased from
£55,716,900 to £55,470,000-a decline of £246,900. From
’94 to February, ’96, it further dropped to £47,225,800—a
drop of £8,244,200. From ’9l to ’94 the capital value of
the suburbs went up from £51,174,200 to £53,481,000.
Then by February, ’96, it fell to £49,466,400 —a drop of
£4,014,600. In two years, therefore, over £12,250,000 of
values have disappeared in Sydney and suburbs alone —
the S.M. Herald reckons the decline up to June, ’96, at
£13,360,000. The question now is : How much further is
the drop going? In other words :Is the depression about
ended, or is this about the middle of it, or is it only fairly
commenced ?
* * » *
Of making estimates there is no end. The pro-
bable N.S.W. gold-product for 1896 may be reckoned on a
basis different to that adopted for another par. on the
same subject. The N.S.W. gold received at Sydney Mint
for half-year ended June 30 was 103,7210 z. A nominal
amount of 43Soz. was received at Melb. Mint, but it need
not be reckoned on, as it might (probably not ) be reckoned
in the exports of uncoined gold, which are large, though
not as large as last year, owing to the short-sighted draft-
ing of the Sydney Mint regulations. The uncoined gold
exported for the six months amounted to £153,482, or,
say, 39,0000 z. This weight added to the mintage gives a
total of 132,7210 z. for the half-year—leading to an esti-
mate of 265,0000 z. for 1896. Another method is to take
the difference between imports and exports of coined and
uncoined gold. The quantity imported was £925,146;
exported, £1,523,532 —the difference being £598,386—5ay
150,0000 z. or 300,0000 z. for the year.

A Melb. stockbroker, who is said to have cleared
over £90,000 on several successive- recent mining-stock
deals, once gave as his reason for dismissing a clerk, that
he (the clerk) “ was too fond of speculation.”

When are there to be, in the Australian pro-
vinces, Public Trustees Acts, on the M.L. model, to relieve
the public mind of the fear of fraudulent solicitors, &c. ;
to take charge of the public trust-funds, such as Savings
Banks deposits, and so relieve impecunious Treasurers
from temptation; to give debtors, mortgagors, &e., a
ready method of fulfilling their engagements with ab-
sentee creditors and mortgagees; and, not least import-
ant, to take charge of the large amount of unclaimed
dividends, deposits, and interest now exploited by banks,
companies, &c. &c. ?

The other day a well-known jury-squarer was
threatened by a certain “ D.” with prosecution. Quoth
thesquarer: “Go ahead, my boy. If I fall, you and a
good many more of you chaps will fall with me. You
remember that little affair at ———, and Sarah ’s
trouble, and —&c., &c., &c.?” Jury-squarer prosecutions
are off for the present.
The Wasn’t Beef
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were many stories told in the
smoke-room of the s.s. Mararoa that voyage,
Maoriland to Sydney. The one which fol-
lows was related by a suave, elderly man,
wearing such beautiful clothes, and such
lovely crumb-cloths over his boots, that he could
not possibly bave said the thing which wasn’t.
He looked and ordinarily spoke like one who had
sat in a bank-manager’s room, refusing overdrafts
all his life. He hadn’t. He had trodden many
wild, whooping war-paths and crimsoned many
strange towns in his day. The sea-salt was still
in his blood, and when he “ talked sea,” the con-
ventional bleat dropped away from him, and his
voice became the voice of a man who had shaken
hands with death.
* * * *
We were maundering about flogging in the
army and navy. He chipped in. “Eloggingwas
an unpleasant spectacle,” he remarked, medita-
tively. “ The sight always made me first sick,
then mad—-mad to murder someone, preferably
the presiding officer. A military flogging was
nastier than a naval. The seaman, weather-
tanned and wiry, strips brown and hard; the
soldier, always buttoned up, has shoulders white
as a woman’s. The first one or two lashes
did little more than humiliate the spectator —to
see another human being subjected to such
infamy. But soon the flogged man’s flesh
began to twitch and shiver anticipatively—
to creep and crawl over his bones, and,
as it were, entreat mercy of the snake-like
things writhing in the air—not mercy of the
wielder, understand; those I have seen flogged
were either dumb or merely cursed the uniformed
butcher in charge of the parade. After the first
few lashes, which whistled as they fell, great
crimson weals started into view; these purpled,
and then the blood oozed, as from a hard-
beaten steak, and the now soggy cat made duller,
deader sounds and —splashed a little. Later, gouts
of flesh and blood spattered the triangles, and the
man’s back (not the man, mind) sobbed. And,
from that to finish, his outraged shoulders looked
like dead cow—cancered cow! Yah ! it was
beastly—obscene ! Bah ! —waiter, bring me a
whisky ! ”
* * * *
Presently he continued : ‘ ‘ The first
punishment parade at which I assisted ended
peculiarly. Here is the story.
“ The Indian Mutiny was booming. The
cry was, ‘ Help, or we perish! ’ Duncan Duncan’s
ship, the Cospatriek—she was afterwards burnt,
you remember —was bound from Portsmouth to
Calcutta with mixed detachments of troops,
mostly unripe roughs raked from city slums and
shipped before they had assimilated sufficient
commissariat rations to counteract semi-starvation
and city filth. As we ran into the tropics they
dropped like rotten sheep—died of sunstroke,
moonstroke, heat apoplexy, blue funk, and nothing
in particular. There was a big mob of them in
’tween decks, and, in the orlop, a weird concourse
of soldiers’ wives—chiefly, though they didn’t
know it, widows going to meet husbands dead
and crow-picked on the plains of Bengal. Superior
officers being scarce those days, the officer in
charge was only a captain. There was a decent
lot of soldier-officers aboard, and, when British
officers are good, they are white indeed. When
bad, nothing meaner wriggles in Jehannum. Gap
tain Strutt, commanding the military, was bad-
vain, spinsterish, and spiteful, incompetent to
command a corporal’s guard. Eternally nagging,
asserting his dignity, and hurting someone, the
suspicion he was laughed at perpetually haunted
him; and he was laughed at —from Portsmouth
Hard to Hooghli. He had, for henchman and
spy, his color-sergeant, one Quigley, loathed fore
and aft the ship, an Irishman of the variety that
spawns informers. He carried his patron the
gossip of the cook’s galley and the lee-scuppers,
supplemented by pernicious Celtic imagination.
• * * *
“ The Cospafcrick was, for her day, a big
ship—l2oo tons, half - clipper frigate - built at
Moulmein, strong as teak could make her. Con-
sequently, her skipper was smart. Not that old
Scott looked smart. Strangers took him for the
ship’s cook in shore-togs, or a South Sea missionary
in uneasy circumstances. He wore, in all lati-
tudes, the same snuff-colored suit, bagged from
clew to earring, a baggy stove-pipe hat, speaking-
trumpet, and, in his countenance, a bulged cheroot.
Yet, long before we struck blue water, all men
knew who commanded that hooker. Handle a
ship ! You should have seen him ! And they were
ships and carried sails those days. None of your
footy little double topsails, but acres of vast belly-
ing canvas, with four rows of" reef points. And
stun’sails wherever you could rig boom or get tack
aft. Scott interfered little. But, in an all-hands
squall or special hanging-on, he’d wobble up and
take charge, and then the music ’d begin to play.
Off the Gulf of Guinea down came—the glass
giving no warning—a howling harmattan, a sudden-
death squall. Most men would have up helm and
ran, thanking God for the chance. But old Scott
just sniffed once or twice and then gathered in,
without starting one rope-yarn, our clouds of
canvas smoothly as an old lady picking the wash
off a line. And carry on ! I smile ! Why, just
south and to westward of the Cape, he began
running his bit of easting down before a big
Western buster, and it freshening. He clapped
on fore-topmast and lower stun’sails square
lowers—both sides —lit an extra baggy cigar and
invited her to rip. And it freshened—and fresh-
ened—and it freshened ! And the green seas
roared and ravened behind her. And when every-
thing groaned and creaked and squealed and
shrieked, and she with the blind paralytic staggers,
he rigged preventer lifts and braces and told the
ship to snort for all she was worth, while he
squatted, serene as a scented seraphim, on the
poop-rail well to windward, so’s to come up
on her keel if she turned turtle. The gale
grew wickeder and more wicked. All the
devils came up out of the bottomless pit and
sat on the waters, and howled at moon and
ship. And when it seemed no miracle even could
have saved the whole bag of tricks from going by
the board, old Scott stretched himself, yawned,
picked up his old trumpet, called the hands, and,
in a brace of shakes, that great ghostly heap of
canvas fluttered inboard soft as snowflakes.
Excuse me, gentleman, but I like to think of that
grand old sailorman, of a breed extinct now as the
moa!
* * * *
“Autocrats like Strutt and Scott couldn’t
revolve in the limited orbit of shipboard without
collision. We were a swagger employ, and
fancied ourselves and put on side. Therefore the
Cospatriek carried ten midshipmen, to look pretty
in harbor and wear as much gilt button as could
be sewn on their clothes. At sea they were

generally tarring, except when they were slushing
down. They worked the mizzen and saved
owners seamen; yet it cost each of them about
£ jOO for three voyages. Little Jacky Willoughby
danced down the mizzen rigging one day with a
slush bucket and crossed the poop tvvixt the wind
and Strutt’s nobility. Also Jacky, a pretty boy,
winked at a young lady Strutt admired, and the
girl winked back at Jacky.
“ Strutt, twirling a flaccid, wan moustache,
snapped out, ‘ Here, you d d boy ! ’
Jacky smiled like the cherub he wasn’t and
said softly, so’s the girl mightn’t hear, ‘•Who the
blanky blank do you call d—d boy ? ’
“ Up came old Scott:
“ ‘ What is the matter ? ’
Strutt blasphemed till the weather leeches of
the tops’ls stopped shaking to listen.
‘ I m annoyed by these dirty boys who walk
about the poop when I’m here. These young
blackguards should be warned off a place where
gentlemen are.’
What’s your name ? ’ said Scott to Jacky.
“ ‘ Willoughby, sir.’
“ ‘ What’s your father? ’
“ ‘Admiral, royal navy, sir.’
“ ‘ Thank you, Mr. Willoughby ; that will do.’
You see, sir,’ the old man said, ‘there’s a
little blackguard ’ who’s a bigger gentleman even
than you. He’s more useful to this ship than you
are, sir ; and he’s an officer of this ship, and you’ll
please treat my officers with respect, sir.’
“Strutt foamed, ‘ What d’ye mean by— ! ’
“ ‘ Don’t swear on iny poop, sir. The weather
side of this poop belongs to the captain of the
ship, and his name’s Scott. Get to leeward,
sir ! ’
“Hereafter there was war between the two
commanders, and somehow the midshipmen fre-
quently dropped coils of rope, tar-pots, and mis-
cellanea from the mizen top, just when Strutt
happened to prance beneath.
“ There was a private soldier aboard
named Harry Beaumont—a smart, good-looking,
merry fellow with some education and a genius for
caricature. His comrades: adored him, and the
midshipmen made him: free of . their berth and
tilled him up with ship’s rum and loot from the
'•uddy pantry. Almost every noon he stuck on
the mainmast a .clever caricature of some member
of the floating community ; nearly everybody in-
spected and grinned over these works of art,
Strutt and Quigley hated .the. artist. He had
severely caricatured the latter, ; while Strutt sus-
pected that Beaumont frequently caricatured him
for the private delectation of his (Strutt’s) foes,
the middies.
* * * *
“ In an evil hour Beaumont stuck up for
public inspection a caricature of Strutt. Quigley
spying it, howled for Beaumont.
“ ‘ Take that thing down and destroy it ! ’
“An order is an order. Beaumont removed the
sketch and put it in his pocket,
u < to destroy it. What d’ye mean ?’
“‘lt is my private property, color-sergeant.’
Quigley made the man a prisoner for ‘ direct
disobedience of orders ’; Strutt, delighted, put
him back for a detachment court-martial. He
was tried and sentenced to fifty lashes!
* * * *
“ ‘ Captain Scott, I have to inform you, as
master of this hired transport, that I intend the
day after to-morrow to hold punishment-parade.’
Thus Strutt, with ineffable pomp.
Well, parade away—if it will do you any
good,’ said Scott, continuing his quarter-deck
tramp.
‘ But I will require your assistance to rig the
gratings.
To rig—wh-a-a-t ? ’
1 he gratings—that fellow Beaumont has been
sentenced to be flogged. 5
“‘Onboard MY ship?’ The old man, green
with suppressed bile, chewed hunks off his
cheroot.
“ ‘Most certainly, Captain Scott.’
‘ I’m damned if you shall! 5
“ But Strutt had the skipper in a cleft stick,
knew it and gloated over it. He produced his
copy of the charter-party, the regulations, and his
instructions, and, in the presence of his adjutant,
formally demanded, in the Queen’s name, Scott’s
co-operation.
‘ ‘ The latter—an old hand a t trooping--perceiving
Strutt held the ace, and that refusal of assistance
might entail serious . consequences, went on
another tack. There were ladies aboard—it was a
Pity to ruin a smart youngster like that Beaumont
he (Scott) had never seen a flogging—had sworn
no man should ever be flogged in a ship of his—
&c. —&c.
‘ But the reptile was unassailable by any argu-
ment. He gloated over the idea of working-off
several grudges upon Beaumont's back. Eventu-
ally Scott sang out for his chief mate. ‘ Ac-
quaint this officer with your wishes, sir,’ he said
to the now over-swollen Strutt—and flung below.
* * * *
“ Of course, the news that there was to be
a flogging-match leaked out. The gaiety of the
sh iP was straightway quenched. Old soldiers
sulked about the decks with louring looks, and
actually neglected three-card brag ; some of the
younger ones began to be sea-sick again, while
others loafed on. the spars and snivelled surrep-
titiously ; the few ladies on board petitioned
Strutt, without avail; the soldiers’ wives, opined
they’d like to get ‘ the mane little Scutt (Strutt) in
a barrick wash-house for ten minutes, bedad ! ’
Ihe crew debated the propriety of shoving the
gory lobster over the side ; the midshipmen
tiling sharp-pointed iron marline - spikes in the
mizzen-topmast rigging, to drop, should favorable
opportunity offer, ‘accidentally,’ on Strutt’s head :
•Jacky Willoughby, who was fourteen and sensi-
tive, and the young lady, who was nineteen and
sympathetic, mingled tears over the taffrail in the
second dog-watch, and the girl, to comfort Jacky,
and though Jacky smelt tarry, kissed him a good
deal— as a mother might,’ she explained to the
youth.
Strutt knew the sensation he had caused and
enjoyed it. But he didn’t walk under the mizzen-
top, or go on the forecastle, or take any other
risks. Scott wouldn’t speak to him, but" Strutt
found comfort in the attitude of the chief mate
who was almost oppressively urbane. There was’
by some horrid mischance, no cat-o’-nine-tails on
the ship. ‘ Never mind, leave it to me ; I’ll soon
knock you one up, sir,’ said the mate. And with
his own hands he made a thing out of shark-line-
heavy enough to have flogged an elephant. ‘ Why
it would kill the man ! ’ explained Strutt. The
mate was very sorry, and constructed out of
soft rope-yarns an instrument which wouldn’t
have injured a wet-nursed baby. Then Strutt
laboriously and at great length explained exactly
the kind of cat sanctioned by regulations. The
mate seemed disappointed, and "went to work
again. He found, however, such difficulties in
construction that he had perpetually to go to
Strutt for advice, so that the latter could neither
read nor rest. And tlie mate called Strutt several
times at dead of night to ask whether he had not
better work some wire in with the whip-cord
whether bits of lead hitched on to the tails
wouldn’t be more effective—whether he should ask
the ladies for some green velvet to make a bag for
the cat in place of baize ; ‘ velvet, or, say, satin,
would look prettier ’ —and so on. Strutt cursed
mate and cat categorically ; but next day the
mate was as affable and in as much need of in-
formation as ever.
* * * *
“ Also that next day Scott made another
appeal to Strutt, who answered :
“ ‘ Sir, by God, I command the troops. I shall
flog the man. Nothing can prevent me ! ’
* * * *
“ The morning came. The wind must have
shifted, for at 9 a.m. the ship was close-hauled.
At 9.30 the bugles sounded the ‘ Warning ’ for
general parade. Presently the troops marched on
and were packed like herrings each side of the
quarter-deck. The crew, under the second mate,
were on the forecastle. The middies, in uniform
and wearing black crape upon their arms, studded
the lee poop ; the chief mate stood at the break of
the poop ; Scott paced the weather-side.
* * * *
“ ‘Parade—’tenshun ! Pay attention to
the proceedings of a detachment court-martial—
stand-at-ease !’
Phus,Strutt, sumptuous in scarlet stateliness.
Beside him the Adjutant. At his front, on the
after-hatch, the accursed gratings. Near them
the escort and prisoner. Behind these a big
drummer with a small green bag. The soldiers,
glumly, looked straight to their front. A beautiful
morning of splendid sunshine, the breeze balmy,
the sea a divine blue ! Only man, as usual, vile !
-The Adjutant began to read ; the skipper
conned the ship. In the otherwise oppressive
silence the military and nautical phrases mingled
strangely.
“ ‘ For conduct to the prejudice of good order
and military discipline,’ read the Adjutant.
“ 1 Keep your luff, my lad—she’s off the wind ! ’
from the skipper.
“ ‘ Direct disobedience of an order .’
“ ‘ No higher—keep her so ! ’
“ ‘ Sentence ’ —and the adjutant paused while
Strutt snapped out:
ci rn/ <;n i^ um • Pay attention to the sentence ! ’
Ihe drummer mechanically loosed the strings
of the bag ; the surgeon nervously pulled out and
returned his watch ; the chief mate looked hard at
the second, who looked steadfastly at the chief :
every face was set; the sailors forgot to roll their
quids.
The adjutant continued: ‘The court sen-
tences the prisoner to receive—fifty lashes ! 5
“ Strutt: ‘ Tie up the prisoner ! 5
. Ihe latter threw off his jacket and shirt. They
triced him up. The surgeon held his watch in his
hand.
‘‘Then Strutt snarled, ‘Drummer, do your
duty ! See that you do it properly, or I’ll try you
and flog you ! ’
“The drummer drew the cat, threw down the
green bag, bared an arm brawny and supple by
reason of much banging of big drums, measured
Ins distance by the eye, took the cat in his right
hand, shook it with peculiar turn of the wrist, and
ran the fingers of his left hand through to clear
the tails.
“ ‘ Keep her rap full now, my man ! ’
The infernal cat hisses as it rises in the air.
A sound, neither all sigh, sob, or groan, trembles
fore and aft and mingles with the soft soughing of
the sails. The cat—it seems an hour since it was
raised —is fall !
“ ‘ -Breakers on the bow ! Breakers close ahead ! ’
“ Then old Scott, through his speaking-trumpet •
Hard down'! Let go everything! Hands save
ship ! Clear away your boats ! ’
In a moment, like uncaged tigers, crew
middies, ships’ officers - even cooks and stewards—
were swarming all over the ship. Braces were let
go ; yards swung round with a shriek ; the head-
sheets flapped and battered in the wind ; .the fore-
topsail came down with an awful run; the seamen
uttered fearful sea shouts, and the confusion of
death and judgment reigned.
“For one instant the parade stood firm. The
next officers and men were swept aside by the
apparently frantic seamen, - two of whom were
without ceremony, cutting the prisoner down.’
Strutt, almost paralysed between rage and fear
attempted to assert himself.
“Then roared old Scott : ‘Captain Strutt, the
ship s m danger. I order that man down. If
you interfere, it s mutiny. By God, sir, I command
this ship 7 ’
“ Strutt gave one agonised glance round; saw
that the boat s crew were already lowering tho
port cutter; and with a yell flew up the poop
ladder, launched himself into the boat, and
screamed to the men at the falls to lower away !
The little adjutant, who stood firm, looked after
him,, then turned to the other officers who clustered
around and remarked, ‘ The damned coward ! ’
“ Then a light seemed to break on adjutant and
officers simultaneously, and they grinned. ‘Go
quietly below, men,’ said the adjutant, ‘the dan-
ger s quite over ! ’
“ But the parade had nearly melted away, the
soldiers, at first scared, laughing—the sailors had
whispered things to them. \Ye- -we weathered
that—that reef, gentlemen ! ”
* * * *
Someone asked, ‘ Was the man flogged
afterwards ? ”
“No, gentlemen ; there was never any flogging
aboard that ship. 6 °
A rather dense-looking but nautical person in
the smoke-room inquired, “ What was the latitude
and longitude of that reef, sir ? ”
“ About 28 South and, say, 5 West.”
Suffering sailor ! There isn’t a reef within a
thousand miles of it.”
“Think not? Well, it isn’t on the chart, per-
haps; but it was a very fine reef, all the same.
We christened it ‘ The Wasn’t B,eef.’”

AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
CURES
Indigestion, Sleeplessness, Loss of Strength and
Appetite, and Nervous Disorders.
m
The following letter from Mrs. S. Gash, of Kent Town, So. Australia,
whose portrait is given above, is additional testimony to the remarkable
health-giving power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla:
“For two years or more I suffered considerably from indigestion,
sleeplessness, and loss of strength and appetite. When I did sleep I was
not refreshed, and I always had a severe headache in the morning. I was
induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and was more than pleased at the
result, for after taking three bottles my complaints disappeared, and I
have been in the best of health ever since. 1 can strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to any one afflicted as I was.”
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervat-
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that imitation is the sincer-
est form of flattery, and be sure that you get AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
which has stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world’s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. No other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.
