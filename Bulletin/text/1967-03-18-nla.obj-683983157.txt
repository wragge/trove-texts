If a celebration
is worth celebrating
it deserves
thebest
Minchinbury makes it memorable!
When we say "deserves the best"
you must naturally assume that there
are Not-Quite-Best and Not-Best-
At-AII Champagnes. And this is
true. Champagne made the tradi-
tional way (as Minchinbury is), is
the only wine worthy of your cele-
bration. So if it's worth celebrating
it does deserve the best. And that
means Minchinbury. Marvellous
party wine specially a party just
for two. Minchinbury White Seal
Champagne the most famous of
Australian Champagnes. Minchin-
bury Brut Champagne very dry,
superb quality. Minchinbury Spark-
ling Burgundy light in character
and ruby red in colour. Minchinbury
Sparkling Moselle a light, sweet
sparkling wine, Find a reason to
enjoy a Minchinbury sparkling wine
tonight. You may simply want to
celebrate the fact that you like
champagne !
Be wine-wise, choose Minchinbury.
After all, 122 years experience
makes a difference you can taste.

FOR YEARS the mention of Brisbane
evoked in Southerners the memory of
houses on stilts and tram conductors
with Foreign Legion hats. Alas, the
Legionnaire hats have long gone and
modern Brisbane housing is as charact-
erless and earthbound as elsewhere.
But traditionalists can take heart.
In the recent Bligh Plan it is proposed
to put the entire centre of Brisbane
on stilts shops and shoppers aloft,
traffic below.
Tradition
“PLUNDERING SONS,” a pictorial
history of Australian bushranging, has
just been published by Lansdowne. It
seems to give due weight to an import-
ant aspect of the Australian tradition.
But it was printed in Hong Kong.
The Message
SOME SYDNEY BUSES are now
equipped with badly designed and
badly placed rubbish containers, on
which is printed the mysterious legend
“Be Tidy. Be Healthy.” We can’t see
that putting our discarded bus tickets
into bins, although a good thing in
itself, can have any effect on our
health. If we wanted to do anything
for our health we would probably give
up bus tickets and walk.
New Growth
THE BOWL OF PEARS which the
Duke of Edinburgh accepted in Tas-
mania may be taken by the optimists
as a hopeful sign. Britain has in recent
years shown a marked reluctance to
accept Tasmanian apples and pears.
“Blessing in disguise” is always a hard
saying, but in the long run Tasmanian
fruit growers, who lost their trees in
the January fires, may benefit by new
plantings of varieties in greater de-
mand.

ROSS CAMPBELL is a very funny
man, but business is a funny business,
too. In this week’s piece, on the de-
cline of the picturesque in business
names, he writes: “Even if it is ulti-
mately taken over by a giant like
Broken Hill Proprietary, I hope
Delicious Sponges will retain its
identity.” Even as Campbell was writ-
ing, British Tobacco was busy swallow-
ing Sunkist Foods.

WE SOMEHOW FEEL there mightn’t
be so much fuss about the use of VIP
aircraft by members of the Prime
Minister’s family if they didn’t look so
good in bikinis.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
This is a
fine state
to be in
YOUR CORRESPONDENT is most
fearful about the steady deterioration
of relations with New South Wales.
Perhaps the most dangerous feature is
the new Melbourne attitude. Up to the
bank crash in 1893, Melburnians never
had the slightest doubt that they were
the finest gift to mankind and that
“marvellous Melbourne was perfection
in itself.” Celebrated writers such as
Anthony Trollope wrote of this at
length.
However, the disastrous loss of money
in the ’nineties gave us an inferiority
complex about New South Welshmen.
They never suffered quite the way we
did, and only in the past five years
have we got over it.
Symptomatic of our new breed is the
letter that appeared in our “Herald”
the other night. It is worthy of a decent
quote: “How sorry I am for those pam-
pered pets of Port Jackson. Sorry not
for the position they are in fear of
losing, but for the petulant attitude they
are adopting now that Melbourne is
taking its rightful place in the inter-
national air network. For years now
they have had first call on millions
of air travellers of all types who have
passed through Mascot in their droves
every day.
“How wonderfully easy it has been
for them to take their leisurely break-
fasts and stroll out to their midday
departures while we have been obliged
to rush out to Essendon at the crack of
dawn and make a hurried trip to the
harbor city to begin our overseas
travel. Let’s face it. Sydney has got
away with it for far too long.
“Victoria, the nation’s most progres-
sive State and financial capital, has
had to stand aside and watch the
Kingsford Smith complex grow into the
only major international capital. I feel
it\ now time for these men of Botany
Bay to bow gracefully to the winds of
change. While not expecting them to
look further than their own very obvi-
ously limited horizon and recognise
Tullamarine as a meaningful boost to
the country’s progress, I do feel that
these men should at least acknowledge
we in Melbourne should have our
share.”
Sir Henry Bolte, too, is our
Sir Galahad. He is so easy to report.
There are no self-doubts. He said New
South Wales concern was just a “big
joke.” It was inevitable that Tulla-
marine must become the major airport
in Australia because of its geographical
position. But his best line, and again
reported in the “Herald,” was this:
“ ‘However, Sydney will always be im-
portant,’ he added with a smile.” Ah,
yes, can’t you picture that Boltonian
smile.
Another view on this comes from a
representative of Victoria’s Tourist
Development Authority. He said: “I
have no doubt, not the slightest, that
Tullamarine will become Australia’s
greatest airport. You have only to look
at the figures. Right now 40 percent
of all international travel from Aus-
tralia is initiated in Melbourne. There
is no reason why, with Tullamarine
fully operative, we should not get 40
percent back.”
All this has been described in Sydney
as a Melbourne plot. Of course it is.
Look at the forces we have had on our
side. It was hatched during the Menzies
era. On our side we had the Prime
Minister. We still have under Harold
Holt. We' have the Country Party
Leader, Mr. McEwen. We did have the
Leader of the Opposition in Arthur
Calwell. The Minister for Civil Avia-
tion under Sir Robert was Senator
Henty, Launceston-born. It is obvious
that he had to be on our side. Then
do you remember who was the Minister
for National Development at this time?
—Mr. David Fairbairn, an old Geelong
Grammar chap. All Fairbairns from
time immemorial have been Geelong
Grammar chaps under Dr. Darling.
And Dr. Darling “with • his ABC
clique” has been accused of ruining the
Sydney Opera House. Is this plot all
starting to come clear to you? There
are just two key figures in the plot who
do not quite fit into place, Mr. Swartz,
“So they kept extending the
runways. Now it’s only a short hop
from Sydney to Melbourne”
the present Minister for Civil Aviation
and the Federal Treasurer, Mr.
McMahon.
Ahhh, but your correspondent has
been doing some research here. Mr.
Swartz comes from Toowoomba.
Toowoomba always has had -a
deep affinity for Melbourne and vice
versa. It is high, over 1000 feet, and
the climates of the two places are
similar, too hot in summer and too cold
in winter. What’s more see the in-
famous nature of the plot? Too-
woomba has a branch of Myers and
Myers has its representatives on the
Victorian Promotion Committee. As for
Mr. McMahon, one had to do some
real digging, but eventually it was pos-
sible to come up with the answer. At
first his record seemed fairly impec-
cable, born Sydney, educated Sydney
Grammar and St. Paul’s College, Syd-
ney University. But wait, according to
“Who’s Who,” he is a member of the
Melbourne Club. Why? Can’t you
imagine what would happen to him
there? Oh, it has all been devishly well
engineered by Sir Henry.
But as mentioned earlier, your cor-
respondent is very concerned about the
deterioration of relations with New
South Wales. As U Thant pointed out
regarding Washington and Hanoi, the
basic trouble is distrust and fear. Mel-
bourne people think Sydney people
rather slick and slightly untrustworthy.
Sydney people think Melburnians, are
cold, dull, and shamelessly ruthless in
money matters.
Much of the trouble stems from the
fact that there is utterly no contact
between the two States. On a Govern-
ment level we are closer to odd places,
like Monaco, Rhodesia, and Peru. At
least there is diplomatic contact. The
only diplomatic contact we have with
Sydney is through tourist bureaus. We
opened a tourist office in Sydney in
1936, but you did not consider it neces-
sary to open a government tourist
office here until four years ago. The
only entries under N.S.W. in our tele-
phone book are N.S.W. Accom,modation
Travel Service, N.S.W. Wire Products
Pty. Ltd., and N.S.W. Monte de Piete.
The Monte de Piete is valuable, but is
it enough?
Now, this would be my solution.
There should be a meeting between the
N.S.W. and Victorian Cabinets. This
could take place in two railway
carriages, one Victorian, one N.S.W.,
parked on the standard gauge at the
fruit-fly inspection base halfway across
the border at Albury-Wodonga. Then,
after the earlier problems had been
straightened out, we would start a great
getting-to-know-you process. We would
appoint a High Commissioner to New
South Wales and vice versa.
Mr. Askin and his lady could come
on a goodwill tour of all Victorian
cities, and we would be much nicer
to him than we were to Marshal Ky.
Then Sir Henry Bolte and Lady Bolte
could tour all N.S.W. cities- You would
find Sir Henry an awfully good chap
on closer acquaintance.

When a Rugged
Brown Sits Next to
An Amber Gleam
STEPHEN MOORE is a 32-year-old
Englishman of the “Alfie” stamp, slight,
handsome, and witty, with a good head
of dark brown hair, all his own, which
has been every color from blond to
brunette, but is at present untouched.
Mr. Moore has just opened Sydney’s
first “men’s amenities centre,” a some-
what unattractive name masking such
activities as hair tinting, permanent
waving, or permanent straightening,
hair-spraying, wigs and toupees, and
hair-conditioning.
As well as being a world hairdressing
champion (in 1960 Moore was in the
top British men’s hairdressing team),
he has 47 British hairdressing titles,
and is a member of the Haute Coiffure
Masculine Internationale.
This is all very reassuring to his
clients. So is the bar which is installed
in his 600 square feet of salon and
from which he dispenses drinks, by
courtesy of the management, to his
clients. Handily, he once owned a
couple of cocktail bars in London. He
has also delved into Buddhism, judo,
yoga, and black magic, but that is
neither here nor there. He has been
in Sydney for two years.
His 600 square feet of salon include
a sauna bath, massage rooms and
shower, rest room, drying, cleaning, and
pressing service for those gentlemen
and there are many who want the
full treatment. The price? “I don’t
think my clients worry about it un-
duly,” Mr. Moore said, “but it might
be round $4.50.”
He has some interesting ideas on men
and hair. “We have as large a number
of tints for men as for women, but in
a far narrower range,” he said. “You
rarely find a man wanting a pink rinse,
for example. Men’s hair coloring ranges
from light brown to dark brown, and
we have to be careful what we call the
colors. Rugged Brown would be OK;
Amber Gleam wouldn’t.”
“You don’t say you’re giving a chap
a permanent wave, either. You talk
about giving his hair more life, more
body, long lasting vigor. We’ve been
testing a new hair straightener lately.
Very good product, but we have to
think of a name for it. Hair shaper?
Hair strengthener?”
We tried to think of a manly name
for hair straightener. “You mustn’t let
them think you are mucking around
with their hair,” Mr. Moore went on.
“Nothing cosmetic, nothing fake. You’re
always improving whatever’s there.
Tints only ‘bring out the real color.’ ” I
What about the undeniable falseness
of a toupee? “We stress that a goodi
head of hair is necessary for a force-
ful, dynamic, youthful image. Neces-
sary to keep a chap in line for promo-
tion. We make sure that they don’t have
to fiddle around with the hair-piece. I
can fix it so that it stays in place for
about a week, even at night. That way
they almost forget about it.”
Mr. Moore has developed a “blow-
dry” technique. He first cuts the hair,
then shampoos it, then cuts again with
a razor. Then he picks up each strand
of wet hair and dries it with a hand-
dryer, sometimes using a finger as a
roller to give height in front, sometimes
twisting a strand around in a curl,
When each strand of hair is dry it falls
neatly into place.
Why don’t other hairdressers use this
technique? “Takes too long,” Mr.
Moore said. “You have to be on the
spot. When you stick a few rollers in
you.can shove the client under the hair-
dryer to burn for half an hour while
you deal with other clients.”
This is one reason why Mr. Moore
is more expensive than the general run
of hairdressers. It is also a reason why
so many women go to the men’s
amenities centre. “They’re welcome,”
Mr. Moore said. “They are women
who know how important cutting is to
a hairstyle.”
Wasn’t there some embarrassment
when a Rugged Brown sat next to an
Amber Gleam? “Not at all,” Mr.
Moore said. “They chat away quite
happily. Liven the place up no end.
The other day two stunning blondes
had appointments for tinting, cutting,
and styling. One of my regulars came
in and, as usual, started by looking at
his watch and saying, ‘Look, I’ve only
got 15 minutes, you’ll have to do me
right now.’ Then he saw the women.
‘l’ll wait,’ he said. In the end I had a
row of men sitting waiting pretending
to read their papers. Every time the
girls recrossed their legs eyes would
appear over the top of the newsprint-
Everyone enjoyed it.”
Will this jolly atmosphere prevail
when the sauna bath opens in a couple
of weeks? “Men only there,” Mr,
Moore said regretfully. “Otherwise it’d
be a real old bit of Bacchanalia,
wouldn’t it?”
It would. Many a rising executive
might be late back to the office after
a lunchtime haircut under those circum-
stances. .Even so, it is inspiring to think
of the men who will hurry off at 5.30
p.m. to restore themselves for the eve-
ning ahead.
After a session with Mr. Moore they
will emerge freshly shirted, cleanly
suited, shaved, showered, saunaed,
massaged, tinted, and with their hair
shaped and blown dry.
Heaven help the girl who doesn’t
notice the difference!

This girl is able to handle 25 external lines and hundreds of internal extensions, with smooth
efficiency . . . and still look after the petty cash.
The first thing you notice, when you
install the STC Pentaconta Pushbutton
PABX, is the staff saving. One girl can
supervise a large board, like this 200-line
extendible unit, with ease. You'll also
notice the gain in communications effi-
ciency.
Your customers will notice it too. They
will discover that calls into your business
are always answered promptly, never
cut off. You will find inter-departmental
and outside calls all go through faster.
Fact is, you now have working for you the
most advanced business telephone system
there is: STC Pentaconta.
The STC Pentaconta does more for you
than any other system. For example, any-
one in your organisation receiving a call
will be able to transfer the caller direct to
any other extension, simply by pressing a
button, without recalling the operator.
Anyone, on any extension, can hold an
outside exchange call while making a
second call, inside or outside. You can
even dial from any extension direct to
your mobile radio vehicles. These features,
speed and reliability, make the STC
Pentaconta much more than a telephone
system: it's an investment in overall
business efficiency. And more and more
companies, large and not-so-large, are
finding how well it pays off.

ON THE
MARGIN
Making a
name for
oneself
A SADDENING FEATURE of the
business world is the decline of partner-
ships. I acquired a respect for them
early in life in Melbourne, where part-
nerships used to flourish greatly. The
drapery shops there were a roll-call of
famous paired names Foy and Gib-
son, Hicks Atkinson, Ball and Welch,
Buckley and Nunn. They were institu-
tions, brooding presences of enormous
power and dignity. As a boy I felt a
perverse compulsion to Spoonerise
them, and would walk down Flinders
Street muttering, “Nuckley and Bunn,
Wall and Belch.” Wall and Belch had
a very satisfying sound.
After years of exposure to a revered
partnership, one becomes incapable of
thinking of the members separately.
The idea of Foy without Gibson was
as improbable to me as curry without
rice or William 111 without Mary. So
it was a shock, when I came to Syd-
ney, to see a shop called simply Mark
Foy’s. I soon learned that this go-it-
alone spirit was common among Sydney
retailers. Men like Jones, Farmer, Foy,
and Snow were robust individualists.
Although it is true there had been
the historic alliance of Nock with
Kirby, partnerships were less frequent
than in Melbourne.
Today, in all capitals, businesses
named after people are mostly old-
established ones. The trend is toward
impersonal nomenclature. Industrialists
often choose something grand and im-
posing, like Australian Consolidated
Industries or Universal Excavations.
Other firms prefer a name that will
advertise their product and enhance its
image, like the Lovable Brassiere Co.
or Penguin Ice Cream Ltd.
The family-type name, with its “and
Sons” or “8r05.,” is becoming a thing
of the past. Only the companies mak-
ing foodstuffs try to provide a touch
of domestic sentiment. Thus we find
operating in this sphere such concerns
as Aunt Mary’s Pty. Ltd., the Mother’s
Choice Flour Co., and Big Sister Foods
Ltd. No business, so far as I know, has
yet called itself Big Brother.
Partnerships survive mostly among
solicitors, brokers, and accountants. In
the legal field, Melbourne’s flair for
sonorous names is evidenced by the
matchless combination of Hedderwick,
Fookes, and Alston. The legend goes
that there never was a Fookes in this
venerable firm, but that the other part-
ners inserted the name for its haunting
effect on the ear. If this is true, the
ruse was successful. Nobody who hears
the name of Hedderwick, Fookes, and
Alston ever forgets it. This fact has
doubtless contributed to the firm’s pros-
perity.
A good partnership name for solici-
tors should have a Dickensian, Dodson,
and Fogg flavor about it. There used
to be a pleasing quality in repetitive
names like Smith Smith Smith Dill-
wood and Smith (where Dillwood was
either dead or married to a Smith).
Sydney still* has two noted representa-
tives of this school in Allen Allen and
Hemsley and Stephen Jaques and
Stephen; but the tradition is dying.
To confer distinction, at least one
name in a firm should be more uncom-
mon than the others; Jaques, for ex-
ample, gave a needed touch of variety
to the Stephens. The partnership of
Marshall Marks Dezarnaulds and Jones
is a good illustration of the" principle.
Without Dezarnaulds, Marshall Marks
and Jones would be close to the hum-
drum.
Among architects, advertising agen-
cies, and public-relations consultants,
the word “Associates” has come into
use. To my mind it has a frigid sound,
lacking in the shoulder-to-shoulder
spirit of a partnership. You feel that
Associates are just chaps who use the
same office.
I do not decry altogether the de-
personalisation of commercial names.
Some of the modern ones are vividly
descriptive, like Delicious Sponges Pty.
Ltd. Even if it is ultimately taken over
by a giant like Broken Hill Proprietary,
I hope Delicious Sponges will retain its
identity.
What I regret is the passing of the
special magic attached to great partner-
ship names. British firms excel in
creating it nothing could surpass
the grim purposefulness of Dorman
Long, who built the Sydney Harbor
Bridge, or the luxurious aura of Fort-
num and Mason. In Australia this
potency characterises the names of old
woolbroking firms, with their back-
ground of sunlit plains extended. Doug-
las Stewart drew attention to it in the
fine poem he addressed to one of them:
Schute Bell Badgery Lumby,
How’s your Dad, and flow’d your
Mum be?
I don’t believe anyone could write a
poem about a firm called Schute and
Associates.

The pleasure of any possession that is the product of
genius is worth a lot of money. In Parini suits, this is
what you buy. Luxurious fabrics, selected regardless
of cost, wherever they can be found. Craftsmanship
upon which that expensive commodity called time is
never allowed to impinge, because Parini tailors are
perfectionists. Craftsmen of the old school now
all too few around the world.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Combining late
breakfast with
early lunch
ONE OF THE MOST memorable
meals of my life was served to me many
years ago, at about 9.30 a.m., while I
was still half asleep. A silver tray,
red rose, two glasses, a bottle of cham-
pagne in an ice-bucket, and a little',
plate covered with slivers of hot toast
covered with pate (with truffles). There-t
she goes again with her expensive'
tastes! But remember it was the
most memorable breakfast of my life,
and it only happened once.
This is not to say that something
rather good cannot occasionally be made
out of breakfast, a late breakfast which
combines the virtue of both breakfast'
and lunch, and which has been called
brunch. I’m thinking now of weekends,
and particularly Sundays. No one likes
to get up too early, but on the other
hand you sometimes feel quite hungry.
And yet a late breakfast may spoil your
appetite for lunch. So think in terms l
of a brunch party one of these days*
—perhaps on Good Friday or Easter
Sunday. Ten to ten-thirty is a good
time to ask people to brunch, with the
idea of eating by eleven.
You shouldn’t worry about pre-
brunch drinks, unless you feel like
running to black velvet. And even this
doesn’t cost too much, if you only
serve each person one or two glasses.
The Guinness makes even the most!
naive domestic champagne taste re-
markably presumptuous. Personally, I
prefer my champagne neat or mixed
with something more interesting, such
as a few crushed strawberries steeped
in brandy; put a tablespoon of the mix-
ture in each glass before topping up.
Or orange juice and champagne.
A glass or two of this and everyone
will be ravenous. So you can let your-
self go on the solid food. Grilled kid-
neys in rich, brown gravy laced with
sherry; lamb’s fry and bacon; or . try
that old-fashioned recipe for kedgeree
that your Scottish grandmother used to
talk about an appetising fish-and-rice
mixture.
For a change, follow the main event
with pain perdu instead of toast and
marmalade. Literally translated, it
means “lost bread,” or stale bread that
would normally be thrown away. For
six slices of bread (preferably thick),
bring f cup of milk to the boil and
add 1 tablespoon of sugar and | tea-
spoon vanilla extract.
When slightly cooled dip the slices

of bread briefly into the milk and let
them drain. Beat up three eggs and dip
the soaked bread, making sure each
slice is well coated. Fry the slices
quickly in hot butter, until they are
golden on both sides. Sprinkle with
sugar and cinnamon and serve warm.
One of our favorite brunches we
picked up from a Canadian couple in
England .flapjacks and grilled pork
sausages or bacon, with maple syrup
poured over the lot. It sounds revolt-
ing, but the combination of flavors is
.superb.
The flapjack mixture can be made
the night before and kept in the
refrigerator until needed. It’s simply
Boz. of self-raising flour, 1 tablespoon
of baking powder, 2 eggs, \ pint of
milk, and | teaspoon of salt, all beaten
together. (This batter should be thicker
than ordinary pancake mix; if it’s too
thick by next morning, add a little cold
water.) The flapjacks are best made in
an electric frypan, which will take
about half a dozen at a time (one per-
son’s portion). Before starting to cook
stir in about 3oz. of melted butter and
beat well. A tablespoon of the mixture
is the ideal size, cooked fairly slowly on
both sides until brown, and served in a
pile. Insert a nut of butter between
each flapjack before pouring over the
hot syrup.
One of the best brunch dishes, sur-
prisingly enough, is Chili con came,
served with split hot buttered rolls. It
is well worth making' your own the
night before, rather than opening a
can. Brown in oil for five minutes an
appropriate amount of minced steak
(although ordinary mince will do),
breaking the lumps with a fork or
spoon, and transfer to a heavy sauce-
pan with a lid.
For each pound of meat add six
chopped, ripe tomatoes, 1| tablespoons
of chili powder, 1 green pepper cut
into strips (minus seeds), 1 cup of
kidney beans soaked previously in cold
water for at least 12 hours, and 4
tablespoons of water. Chop two onions,
fry lightly in a pan with two crushed
cloves of garlic, and add to the pot.
Finish with salt and black pepper and
cook the whole lot very slowly for an
hour or so, stirring frequently to pre-
vent sticking.
In the morning reheat the pot care-
fully. Mix 2 teaspoons of flour with
1 teaspoon of finely crushed or pounded
caraway seeds; make this into a paste
with a little juice from the pot, and
stir it into your chili to thicken it
before serving. (A bit of cream, though
not essential, is gorgeous.)
When your guests have had enough,
hit them with a Marguerita as well as
coffee or hot chocolate (which is what
the Mexicans seem to drink with
chili). Margueritas are made with
tequila, now obtainable here. Chill the
tequila, add a good squeeze of lemon
juice (proportion about 4:1) and a
dash of cointreau, shake or stir well
with ice, .and pour into glasses whose
damp rims have been dipped into a
saucerful of salt.

the new
Kodak Carousel ‘S' Projector
An improved Carousel Projector at a
new low price. Up to 80 slides ride
on a circular slide tray and are gravity-
fed automatically as it turns. Gravity
itself would have to fail for slides to
jam! A tough, transparent cover keeps
slides safe from dust and scratches
right through the show, and when it’s
over the whole tray simply lifts off
cover and all for storage.
Inside, there’s another revelation. A
24V, 150 watt quartz-iodine lamp.
Little bigger than a flashbulb, it gives
an astonishingly brilliant, ultra-white
light yet lasts twice as long as old
fashioned bulky lamps. Projector
operates on 240-250 volts A.C.
The lens is a superb 100 mm Schneider
“Procolar” with a standard of defini-
tion which will surprise you no matter
what you’re used to. And remote
control comes as standard, with pro-
vision for tape synchronization too!
Built in Germany where the “Retina”
precision cameras come from, the
Carousel S is undoubtedly one of the
finest 35 mm slide projectors ever
made by Kodak or anyone else.
You owe it to your slides to see the
Carousel ‘S’ Projector at your Kodak
dealer’s. Price, including lamp: $174
or £B7.

AUSTRALIA
The Duke’s visit:
feeling the way after LBJ
THERE WAS SOMETHING very
moving, quite appealing, and pleasantly
surprising about the opening of the
recent visit by Prince Philip, Duke of
Edinburgh. From the moment he faced
Australia from the stage of his tele-
vision conference room in Canberra, he
began to project a new image of what
used to be called “the Palace” — a
relaxed, friendly, “good chap” image —
with, somehow, an air of pathos about
it.
“We are not in the Middle Ages;
the monarchy is not a personal posses-
sion,” the Duke said briskly. “If it is
of value, we should keep it; if not we
should get rid of the system or change
it.”
There it was, out in the open, and
coming best from someone who spoke
for royalty, showing how much it had
changed, recognising how much Aus-
tralia might have changed toward it.
Princess Alexandra was about to leave
us after a private visit which hardly
anyone had noticed. The Duke of
Edinburgh was here for ten days in
which he might also have gone almost
unnoticed but for television.
His reason for being in Australia was
to arrange final details for his third
Commonwealth Study Conference, to
be held next year. But one of his first
acts was typically “old Royal,” the
visit to the stricken area, the interest
shown, the sympathy expressed, and
the response forthcoming from the
most “old Australia” part of our land,
Tasmania.
The Duke was at his easiest there,
talking to farmers, visiting a pub, de-
clining champagne and calling for beer,
chatting to schoolchildren who had
come to the airport to see him off.
Then on to Melbourne for a Study
Conference luncheon, a few waves to-
ward any heads that turned (two
Moonee Ponds Mrs. Everages wheeled
their prams in front of the Duke’s car
without a glance), on to Government
House to present 16 medals to girls
and youths, a State dinner that night,
away to Sydney to see the Opera
House, take the tiller of the “Dame
Pattie,” attend a State luncheon, pre-
sent more youth medals, and explain
the Study Conference for the ABC.
It was “modern Royal,” trying to be
helpful, and visible but not too obtru-
sive, feeling the way after LBJ. As the
Duke had said on arrival to the ques-
tion (sharply put and cheerfully
taken), did he foresee a Republican
Australia? “I would not be surprised at
anything in Australia.”
In Sydney, if the crowds were thin,
the 350 guests at last Thursday night’s
Study Conference cocktail party made
up for it. The men of Sydney, as repre-
sented by business and industrial
leaders, professionals and senior public
servants, all vied at shaking the ducal
hand while the women stood apart
(had Australia changed that much,
after all?). The Duke stayed an hour,
this time declined the beer, and the
prawns, for gin and tonics. He flew off
to Brisbane next day for more State
dining.
Probably the visit had turned out
better than expected. The Duke had
had an excellent Press and had made
as good an impact on television as
LBJ or Premier Ky. He had been, if
anything, over-feted and over-dined.
The only notable absence among his
possible courtiers was that at no stage
did Harold Holt appear, to encourage
and support. For most of the visit
Mr. Holt stayed submerged, this time
not undersea but in Parliament dis-
cussing the use of VIP aircraft and
other such matters.
Victoria
Elections
SIR HENRY BOLTE has no fears
about hanging being an electoral
liability in this year’s Victorian elections.
He underlined the point by issuing a
challenge to Labor anti-hangers, such
as Barry Jones, to stand against him in
Hampden: a shrewd move to try to
decimate the ALP vote in the conserva-
tive western district. So far the ALP
has not fallen for the trap.
However, ALP leader in the Legisla-
tive Assembly, Mr. Clive Stoneham, has
already declared that hanging will be
a major electoral issue.
In the Higinbotham (Legislative
Prince Philip, 1967
Assembly) by-election last month, the
Liberal Party increased its vote by
about two percent at the expense of
Labor, proved that hanging is not of
electoral significance. It also indicated
that the Liberal Government can expect
to retain the Treasury benches in April.
The Liberal Party has 38 seats in
the Legislative Assembly, the ALP has
18, and the Country Party 10. In
the Upper House the Government has
16 voting members (after providing a
president), to Labor’s nine and the
Country Party’s eight. Following a
recent electoral redistribution, seven
seats have been added to the Repre-
sentatives and one to the Council.
The Liberal Party is confident that
it will return with at least 40 seats
out of 73 in the Assembly. In the
Legislative Council the Liberals have
a chance of regaining the majority.
Sir Henry is now more generally
popular than he was in October, 1964,
because he has managed to convince
the electorate that the Commonwealth
Government is to blame for Victoria’s
impecunity and that his measures to
raise money are the result of Federal
Treasury meanness.
The Country Party claims it has good
prospects of picking up six seats. In
1965, it hired six new organisers and
is hoping to pick up votes by con-
centrating on local issues. Its chances
of making substantial gains will depend
on the allocation of preferences.
There is really only one issue on
which Labor could hope to slice into
Bolte’s majority. The natural gas deal
which the Victorian Government is
negotiating could become an explosive
issue if the charge was set off astutely.
However, the Victorian ALP is better
at dropping clangers than igniting
political fuses.


Rocking the boat
Trouble in the Senate
from ALAN REID in Canberra
WPIEN SENATOR Clive Hannaford
(S.A.) resigned recently from the
Liberal Party on a matter of conscience,
there were those Liberals who sug-
gested that Liberal Senator Reg Wright
(Tas.) should do the same.
A Wright shift from the Liberal
benches to the loneliness of independ-
ence would not resolve an absurd posi-
tion. This is that the Holt Government,
elected with an all-time record majority
in the House of Representatives, has
lost control of the Senate.
Even with Wright it has only 28
supporters in a chamber numbering
60. The Labor Opposition has 28, and
the Democratic Labor Party has two,
and there are two Independents,
Senator (“Spot”) Turnbull, from Tas-
mania, and Hannaford.
But a Wright resignation would, I
think, provide for the electors a more
realistic (and healthier) view of what
is the actual position in the Senate. It
would justify Wright in his attempts
to force upon the Government courses
of action which neither it, as a Govern-
ment, nor the Liberal and Country
want to take.
For Wright is a man who opposes
the Government and its proposals in
the Senate often more embarrassingly
than the Labor Opposition; and who,
because of the delicately balanced
nature of the Senate, can thrust his
viewpoint upon the Government despite
its overwhelming majority in the House
of Representatives.
As I see it, Wright, a lawyer and
sonorous phrasemaker who can make
a minor mistake by the local dogcatcher
sound like an attempt to overthrow the
State by armed insurrection, is willing
to have himself elected to the Senate
on the Liberal ticket, but once there
wants to conduct himself as an Inde-
pendent.
If Wright were in the House of
Representatives, his attitude would not
be so important. At least he would
be taking his political life in his hands.
House off Representatives members are
elected as individuals as well as mem-
bers of a Party. If they take strongly
individualistic iines, they expose them-
selves to correction at the hands of the
electors.
But Senators, with very rare excep-
tions (Turnbull is one), are elected
not because they are Wright or some
other individual but because they have
No. 1 or No. 2 on their Party’s ticket.
They enter the Senate almost anony-
rqously. The electors cannot chastise
them without swinging away nationally
from the Party the elector wishes to
support.
For health reasons, Hannaford does
not intend to contest the next Senate
elections. But if he had, he would be
in a completely clear-cut position vis-a-
vis the voters. He would have had to
get himself re-elected as an Indepen-
dent and not as a number, a place-
holder on a Liberal Senate ticket.
There are those in the Liberal Party
who advocate that Wright, whose dis-
agreements with his party seem in some
cases as fundamental as Hannaford’s,
should be expelled from the Liberal
Party for what Mr. Holt recently
described as a lack of Party discipline,
which could have the long-term effect
of eroding the strength of the Govern-
ment parties from within.
The Senate Government Deputy
Leader, Education Minister John Gor-
ton, a tough, realistic political operator,
clearly believes that Wright should be
outside the Liberal Party.
Wright would then be exercising a
right of independence that he had won
for himself, not because of Liberal
endorsement, and at least a disintegrat-
ing influence within the Party would be
removed.
Wright undoubtedly draws such in-
fluence as he exerts within the Govern-
ment Party room by flattering the
vanity of his fellow Senators. He keeps
telling them that they should be more
important in the scheme of things than
their position as Senators, elected
almost anonymously, justifies politic-
ally.
Personally, I do not think the
Liberals will grasp the Wright nettle.
Their Senate vote in Tasmania re-
presents only 37 percent, which Senate
Government Whip Malcolm Scott told
a Government Party meeting last week
was almost certainly due to Wright’s
“rubbishing” of his Liberal colleagues.
The Liberal leaders will be fright-
ened of rocking the boat to the extent
that this vote declines even further.
But in not wanting to rock the boat
they could be producing a situation in
which, eventually, they will not be able
to prevent the Holt Government sink-
ing. Such a possibility is not so widely
improbable as it may sound. Previous
non-Labor Governments have disinte-
grated because of lack of internal
discipline.
Election promises
A countdown
Treasurer McMahon
WITH ONLY ABOUT a dozen work-
ing weeks gone since the elections, the
Government has moved quickly to
fulfil its election pledges. There were
14 of these, and eight have been im-
plemented.
The new Commonwealth Depart-
ment of Education and Science is
established. Legislation has to be passed
to bring the old Commonwealth Office
of Education within the new department
and get its core staff from Sydney to
Canberra, but already the two are
operating together.
The new money to independent
schools for science laboratories will
soon be flowing, the legislation having
been one of the first pieces of busi-
ness before the new Parliament. Senator
Gorton has toured the States and come
back with a program of aid for the
new teacher-training colleges.
Four Social Services pledges are in
the process of being honored: a small
liberalisation of the means test for
pensions, subsidies for aged people’s
houses, grants for sheltered work-
shops for disabled people, and support
for voluntary social welfare agencies.
Homes savings grants are being given
more flexibly. Three other promises
are not due to be honored until the
next financial year: additional finance
for wool promotion and research, extra
beef road money (Queensland has a
definite promise of $35 million) and
assistance to State departments of agri-
culture in their farm extension activi-
ties. Mr. McMahon has promised that
he would soon announce an institution
to mobilise Australian capital for ex-
ploiting minerals. Proposals for a
national water development program
are before Cabinet. And finally, a bill
to establish an Australian Tourist Com-
mission is being drafted.


Television
Hooligans
EARLY LAST WEEK the ABC’s
“Four Corners” embarked on what it
described as “an investigation, in
depth,” of the hooligan problem in
Sydney. The sketch, with John Pen-
lington as interviewer, consisted mainly
of a grilling of Government psychia-
trist Dr. McGeorge, who had made
conflicting statements about his own
preferred brand of applied psychology
(the birch, or the lash).
For “depth” the documentary team
plunged into darkest Kings Cross, the
usual habitat for Sydney TV teams,
interviewed a newspaper seller, and
raced a half mile to Taylor Square,
Darlinghurst, where teenagers grumbled
that their favorite nightclub might be
closed because of bashings in its
vicinity, and others told of “mod v.
sharpie” gang fights in Paddington.
With three Sydney areas mentioned,
it sounded like a busy week for Mr.
Penlington, until one realised that all
three were within a short walk of the
ABC headquarters in Darlinghurst.
Also, “in depth” meant a discussion of
punishment and deterrent, but not of
cause or remedy.
This and similarly “deep” newspaper
reports lead to comments such as one
in the South Australian Parliament last
week that “we should be thankful we
haven’t Sydney’s problems,” during a
debate on powers of the police, in
which the orator mentioned an incident
in which eight boys armed with bicycle
chains disrupted the start of a girls’
gathering ... in Adelaide.
Late last year, Melbourne had mid-
city “mods v. sharpies” fights, girls were
being attacked in railway carriages.
Our point is not to turn the accusing
finger elsewhere but to suggest these
are phenomena of the times and not
of any particular place.
Perhaps the matter is serious enough
for a more thorough treatment by the
“investigators” of TV?
New Guinea
Storm in a teacup
THE MINISTER for Territories, Mr.
Barnes, spent much of last week ex-
plaining. with the help of Mr. Holt,
that he did not really say it would be
a long time before New Guinea became
independent, if at all.
Those last four words caused all the
furore. But a worse hubbub may be in
store for the hapless Minister when or
if the tea interests, including the tea-
drinking public, awaken to what else
he said.
For in a Melbourne newspaper’s
report, which Mr. Barnes has declared
Territories Minister Barnes
accurate, he said, “The trouble is we
in Australia are conditioned to drink-
ing the worst tea in the world. We will
have to be educated to drink the new
tea.”
The subject was the same New
Guinea. He was speaking of “one of
the most promising industries in the
Territory . . . tea production in the
highlands,” which by 1972 would be
looking for an annual market for 6000
tons, mostly in Australia.
The Minister said it would be 6000
tons of “top quality” tea or, in
statisticians’ figures, 13,440,0001 b.
Whether he had tasted it before de-
claring on its quality, he did not say.
At present we import a mere 26,7461 b.
from Papua-New Guinea, a tiny
fraction of the 67,285,0001 b. we brew
each year.
If New Guinea planters hope to gain
about one-fifth of the present tea
market for their product in five years’
time, who will they have to supplant?
We buy half our tea each year from
Ceylon (38,000,0001 b.), with Indo-
nesia next (12,000,0001 b.), and India
(10,000,0001 b.), with another
7,000,0001 b. or so coming from up to
20 other countries, ranging from
Argentina to Uganda (and including
mainland China, about \\ million
tons).
It would seem that Papua-New
Guinea could find its place in the tea-
pot easily enough, provided that its
“top quality” did not demand too high
a price. Best-quality Ceylon and Indian
teas, unaided by subsidies which keep
our f.a.q. brews below the $1 a pound
mark, sell at up to $2 a pound but
do not sell anything like the
13,000,0001 b. New Guinea will have to
offer.
Perhaps it remains for Mr. Barnes to
say what the Government proposes to
do in the next five years to help New
Guinea break into the “top quality
market,” which the Ceylon and Indian
tea bureaus are spending large sums to
create here; or if not that, to improve
our f.a.q. “worst in the world tea” by
arranging for local importers to blend
it in, improving the average “cuppa.”
It seems that Mr. Barnes’ casual few
words on the subject of tea were much
more pregnant with meaning for the
Australian tea-drinker, which is most of
us, than his more celebrated discussion
of New Guinea independence.
Tasmania
After the fires
WHILE CLEARING up after the
Hobart fires, is going on at full speed
(one family, a builder’s, was in a new
home raised on the ashes within three
weeks) southern Tasmanians are con-
cerned that tourists may be deterred
from visiting the disaster area.
The Tourist Minister, Mr. Atkins,
appealed last, week for Launceston
families to help billet about 3000 march-
ing girls from all States, due in Hobart
at Easter for their Australian champion-
ships. He feared adverse publicity if
some could not be billeted in time.
Naturally enough, plenty of confusion
remains in allocation and distribution
of relief funds and loans. Even Con-
stitutional difficulties came into it when
a six-day period had to pass before the
State Parliament could meet last week
to pass some necessary legislation. But
many district farmers’ groups were
organising self-help campaigns to get
the fences up and stock enclosed.
Animal and wildlife organisations had
their own problems to sort out. Dogs’
homes were crowded with strays fled
from the fires, and wildlife officers
were making surveys of their losses.
In the midst of the current assess-
ments some men, such as Senator Mar-
riott of Tasmania, were looking to
dangers ahead, not of more fires but of
a boom in building soon followed by a
workforce with nothing more to do.
To cushion that, he appealed to the
Government in the Senate to consider
replacing its Hobart buildings, 18
months from now. Describing a PMG
building in Hobart as a slum, and
Repatriation and Social Services build-
ings as “World War I” timber fire
traps, he said their replacement would
“let the boom down lightly.”
Design
Bank emblem
PERSONAL SATISFACTION and
publicity throughout Asia would seem
to be the only worthwhile rewards
to be won in the new Asian Develop-
ment Bank’s contest for an emblem
design, to be used on its flag or seal.
The money is not much SAB9S-
- prize, down to $B9 for third.
The contest is.open to artists from
19 countries in Asia and the Pacific,
including Australians and New Zea-
landers, and closes on April 10 (see
your local Sub-Treasury).


To quote from a recent newspaper,
the Asian Development Bank is a
“necessary but not sufficient” institution
for an area where most of the problems
are non-banking, although banking-up.
Could that be a motif for an emblem?
South Australia
Leap forward
WHATEVER ELSE South Australia
may have by the end of its sudden
leap forward into line with other States
in liquor licences, TAB betting, and
lotteries, there is one department in
which you would have to cross the
Tasman for a parallel—it will not have
barmaids.
This and elimination of suggested
Sunday trading were the only two
recommendations of the S.A. Liquor
Without barmaids
Commission to be omitted from the
new Act. There is agreement in the
State Labor Government with the
Liquor Trades Union’s assessment that
barmaids are “women exploited.” In
debate, the Opposition was invited to
“frolic with barmaids if they wished.”
South Australia’s concern for bar-
maids, however, does not extend to the
women who will be employed by the
State’s TAB, the ticket-sellers who will
meet much the same clientele and work
the same spread of hours and just as
hard.
Arbitration
Responsibilities
FOR ALL ITS reassurance on the
good work being done by the Arbitra-
tion Commission in unobtrusively set-
tling disputes about over-award wages,
the annual report submitted by its
President, Sir Richard Kirby, to Par-
liament last week gets us no further on
the vexed question of how to allow for
wages drift in the determination of
award wages.
With another wage case coming up
so soon after last year’s basic wage rise
and the recent interim increase in mar-
gins, it is urgent that the Commission
find some formula to make the allow-
ance. Pushed to its logical conclusion
of an incomes policy, the employers’
total wage concept would embrace over-
award payments. However, in the
limited shape in which it is to be re-
submitted for consideration this year,
it stops short of meeting the require-
ment. So once again the Commission
will go through its annual rule-of-thumb
ritual of fixing award wages in virtual
isolation from over-award payments.
It is not that Sir Richard doesn’t
recognise the problem or even the
absurdity, only that he takes the nar-
row view. Sitting back on its recognition
that award payments and over-award
ones can (and certainly do) co-exisf in
today’s full employment economy, the
Commission’s only venture into the
over-award payments area has been in
helping to resolve ad hoc disputes in it.
The hidden message in the President’s
latest report is that although the deeper
problem is vexatious to him, he has
not found the answer to it, presumably
even in theory.
Given this failure, for the time being
we have to settle for something less, and
it is salutary therefore that the Com-
mission at least take a positive and
helpful line on its responsibilities under
the Act in the narrower sphere. It
refuses to take the view sometimes
expressed that once it has performed its
functions of prescribing minimum wage
rates and conditions of employment, it
becomes, as it were, functus officio, and
should have nothing to do with par-
ticular cases of bargaining about over-
award payments.
On the contrary, as Sir Richard ex-
plains: “In my thinking, the working
of the Act and achievement of its chief
objects, particularly that of promoting
goodwill in industry, and the emphasis
the Act gives to conciliation, require
Waiting for an Arbitration judgment
the Commission to play a role in this |
area. Its importance is not diminished
by the fact that service is not forced >
but given when sought, and may be in
the nature of a good office rather than
an arbitration.” (
Last year when 309 out of 1451
notified disputes about over-award pay-'
ments were settled through the Com-!
mission’s good offices, 95 percent
originated from employers and only five
percent from the unions. Nearly three-
quarters were disputes in the metal 1
trades. Oddly enough, only two had
an interstate connotation. The Commis-
sion is giving a hand in settling indus-,
trial disputes wherever and whenever it
is called on, despite the apparent
jurisdictional limitations.
This work is catered for under Sec-1
tion 28 of the Act, and, to emphasise (
the important role of conciliators in i
performing it, the records show that
since 1956 they have handled about 4
three-fifths of the over-award disputes ,
notified. The Commissioners did the
rest. Sir Richard wants more of both.
Notifications of disputes on all subjects 1
were just short of 1000 last year. This
brisk business strained the Commission’s
facilities, particularly in Sydney.

The airports
THE LATEST Sydney - Melbourne
dispute over whose international airport
will be No. 1 for Australia misses one
point: in a few years both the Mascot
and Tullamarine airports could be
found wanting by the international air
carriers.
At present no one knows for sure
what runway lengths will be required
for the next advance in airliners, the
so-called “jumbo jets,” which will carry
between 300 and 600 passengers. This
aircraft something to go on with
before the supersonics arrive will be
subsonic, will cost about $lO million,
and may halve trans-ocean airfares.

hall designed to handle only 2000 an

Tullamarine would be worse off, with
an arrival hall designed for 1500 an
hour. Both airports are said to be
capable of expansion in most ways—
except that Sydney does not have Tulla-
marine’s extra 5000 acres for larger
terminal halls and more runways. But
possible expansion is only a concept.
The fact is more likely to be a scream
of “no money,” the DCA’s current
reason for not extending the Sydney
runway to 10,000 feet.
There is no doubt that Australia will
benefit tremendously from the coming
jet tourist age; nor any doubt that, like
any business, Australia will have to lay
out the capital to reap the profits.

Expired maids
PART OF MELBOURNE’S
“Moomba” frivolities procession,
“King” Robert Morley and all—was to
have been the presence of three Gold
Coast-style meter maids dressed in white
woollen mini-skirts with a red sash
advertising the city’s Motor Show.
The girls were to put courtesy five-
cent coins in expired meters, but drivers
seeking parking space complained to
the City Council, which ruled that the
“maids” were infringing by-laws.
So the festivities went on without
them, while a Motor Show spokesman
complained, “The City Council doesn’t
seem to be entering the spirit of
Moomba at all.”

In the ‘Best Luxury Compact’ section of Modern Motor’s

COMMENT
Should we loot the universities?
"You stay clear of youthful violence
or I'll belt you over the earhole."
IT IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY how
you measure the efficiency of anything
at all, but it is particularly mysterious
how you measure the efficiency of uni-
versities. Not only are there contradic-
tory ideas about what universities are
supposed to be doing, but the various
roles suggested for them are almost
impossible to measure. Statistical
approaches can tell a quite false story:
the number of graduates, the number
of words produced annually in research
projects, and so forth, are mere figures,
saying nothing, and in more qualitative
approaches it is usually impossible to
speak in sharp cause-and-effect terms.
Whatever it is that you think uni-
versities should be doing, however,
and whether or not you think their effi-
ciency in doing it can be measured, it
seems hard to imagine that the present
cuts in expenditure are going to do
anything but harm efficiency. It is
logically possible that this puritan
housekeeping will, by its shocks, lead
to a resurgence of greater creative
effort, but in a fun society such as ours
this seems highly unlikely. What the
present system means is that the uni-
versities are being looted of public
money, which will now be spent on
something else.
When our spending on education is
already less than in other nations of
comparative prosperity, or of lower
prosperity, it could, of course, be a
bold move of Australia’s to shift off in
another direction, deciding that the
rest of the prosperous world was wrong
and that high education expenditure
was a waste of money. This does not
seem to be our policy. With that inter-
est in new buildings that appears to
have become an absorbing concern of
our city culture, we are going ahead
planning new universities and new
teaching colleges, but, just as with the
Sydney Opera House, it is the concrete
building itself and not its uses that has
absorbed us, so with the institutions of
tertiary education we seem to have for-
gotten that we shall have to train people
to staff them. It is through postgradu-
ate work that such staff are supposed to
be trained. Already we are not keep-
ing up with demand. The cut in ex-
penditure will now make the position
worse.
In reply, the universities have not
put up much of a case. So much uni-
versity publicity over the past ten years
has been concerned with the language
of money that university spokesmen
seem to have forgotten how to explain
why we should have universities. Their
present protest is confined mainly to
statistics of expenditure and employ-
ment, as if universities were factories
and vice-chancellors works managers.
It is to be hoped that the present
shocks might now arouse some interest
in the role of universities and how
they should be run, and that university
people do not simply sink into an
acquiescent dismay. Here one might
make a criticism. The quality of intel-
lectual life in Australia has been rather
low and to some extent cribbed and
alienated; at the same time there has
been something of distrust or even
hatred among many of our elites to-
ward originality or even a simple con-
cern with excellence. This may suggest
that many or most of the graduates of
universities have not been much good.
Perhaps our universities should now
think about why this is so. It’s not just
because of a lack of money.


KINGS
OF THE
KITCHEN
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Graham Kerr ... the taste of success
"People want good food, good wine, good
music, good clothes. It's world wide."
GRAHAM KERR has done a lot
for food, not only for the toffee-
nosed people but the ordinary
people, too,” said one of his staff. “They
see him do something on television and
say, gosh, that’s not difficult, I’ll try
that.”
Food has also done a lot for Kerr.
His gastronomic success in Australia
has been nothing short of spectacular.
From being No. 1 television idol in
New Zealand, beginning there ten years
ago, he has become a household name
here. His earning capacity is probably
about $120,000 a year.
“But don’t forget he’s got to shell out
a lot from that, like wages to staff,
etc.,” said an informant, who, for the
record, was not his business manager,
Harry Miller. The most Mr. Miller
would say about Kerr’s earnings was
that he is the highest paid television
personality in Australia by far, and
that he may be a millionaire in ten
years.
Kerr certainly began his assault on
Australia at the right moment. Len
Evans, the Director of the Wine
Bureau, believes that what he calls “the
gracious living bit” is a world-wide
movement, and has not flourished here
because of migrant influence. “It’s
happening all over the world,” he said.
“People are beginning to want to enjoy
their money. They want good food,
good wine, good music, good clothes.
It’s the full James Bond thing.”
But the toffee-nosed people who
may have long had a taste for good
food, good wine, etc., could hardly
reject the finer things of life just be-
cause Graham Kerr and television be-
gan to spread the message at many
levels. In the wake of Kerr there has
been something of a boom in gourmet
cooking and the teaching of haute
cuisine. Most of the people in this line
in Sydney were well established before
Kerr arrived, but they might be the
first to admit that Kerr on television
has produced a new competitive spirit
which has enlarged their businesses a
good deal.
Graham Kerr has an incredible capa-
city for work. It is doubtful whether he
ever stops. He once rang Harry Miller
in the middle of the night and with
great excitement said, “Listen, Harry,
I’ve just perfected the most incredible
sauce for pigeons, and I want you to
come over and share it with me . . .”
Mr. Miller, who had been asleep, did
not share Kerr’s enthusiasm, and sug-
gested he put it in the refrigerator until
a reasonable hour next day, when he
would then consider sampling his
culinary achievement.
Graham Kerr’s business ramifications
are fantastic. He does a weekly tele-
vision show, “Entertaining With Kerr,”
a daily radio morning program called
“Graham Kerr’s Kitchen,” he writes a
cookery feature for the “Sunday Tele-
graph,” and is beginning one in THE
BULLETIN; he also supplies other
magazines with articles, writes his own
TV scripts, and has written two cook
books.
The last one, “Graham Kerr’s
Cookbook,” sold 12,500 copies at $7.50,
and a reprint of 15,000 is being rushed
through; the one before that, “Enter-
taining With Kerr,” sold 27,000 copies,
and was second best-seller of the year
(including, says Mr. Miller with relish,
the Bible); Kerr also wrote a rehash
of his TV show last year, “Graham
Kerr’s Studio Kitchen,” which, at 50
cents a copy, sold 25,000 copies in 4J
months and is now out of print.
He has a share in a factory that
makes expensive, high-quality omelet
pans, and runs a cookery school at the
Food and Wine Centre in Wellington,
New Zealand; he is also consultant to
major New Zealand food produce
boards, is regularly on television and
radio, and syndicates colu,mns there. He
has made a deal with a New Zealand
company for production of kitchen
equipment designed by himself, includ-
ing a non-skid mixing bowl, Rota-tray,
and a line of crockery.
“I was against the idea of a rubber-


Johnnie Walker... 30 long years
based mixing bowl,” says Mr. Miller.
“It sold 14,000 in one week.” Kerr
also makes television commercials.
“. . . but only for the best products.”
Manufacturers come into Mr. Miller
and say how much does he want for
Mr. Kerr’s name to be connected with
their product, and people get upset
when he says money is not the point.
“Half the stuff that comes in I wouldn’t
dream of showing to Graham. It’s just
rubbish.”
We are to see even more of Mr.
Kerr. Coming shortly on our television
screens is a once-a-week vegetable mar-
ket report, in which he will be seen
in the midst of potatoes and cabbages
recommending the week’s best buys.
In order to see that he achieves all
this work without a breakdown, there
are (1) staff who research his cooking
and help him in the preparation of
food for TV shows. They pre-test the
recipes, probably a couple of months
in advance; (2) two secretaries who
answer his letters; but Harry Miller says
Mr. Kerr casts his own personal eye
on them before they leave or, at
least, is supposed to and (3) Mr.
Miller himself, who handles the man-
agement side. “I sit down every two
or three days and we go over things.”
For this, Harry Miller receives a per-
centage, reputed to be 40.
For Johnny Walker, who, early in
his own wine-appreciation days, once
made a champagne called Sparkling
Spango, which blew up in his face, the
present boom in good living has come
after 30 long years in the restaurant
business. From 60 to 600 seats is his
proud claim at the Bistro.
At the Bistro, from which many of
Sydney’s gourmet corps have gone
into the field, Mr. Walker has a
continual flow of men and women
attending the Special Hostess Courses
and his Wine Club. They pay $10.50
for a course of five Continental Cook-
ery lessons, and sit at tables sipping
coffee at the morning demonstration
and wine (as suggested suitable accom-
paniment to whatever dish is being
cooked) in the evening. At the end
everyone is given a taste of whatever
has been cooked.
His Wine Club costs $2 to join, plus
$2 per year, but Mr. Walker says the
club does not operate for profit. “Last
year, for instance, each member re-
ceived three or four bottles of wine
worth about $5.” The aim is to intro-
duce people to the joys of wine via
such enticements as bottling parties,
when members can take their own
bottles and buy wine economically in
bulk.
He sent us a massive itinerary cover-
ing club events until June, and we
quote items such as “French Provincial
Evening, classic menu with imported
wines, $7 a head,” and “Italian
National Evening, with an Irish flavor,
$6 a head.” On both occasions, guests
are bidden to attend from 6.30 p.m.
for aperitifs. “And,” says Mr. Walker,
“by golly! they do.” Club membership
runs to 1000, the cookery school sees
900 pupils through a year (including,
on one course, a professor of Sydney
University, and also the Governor of
the Reserve Bank, Dr. Coombs).
Less spectacular are the activities of
the gourmet cooks. This began, in Syd-
ney quietly enough about ten years ago
when ladies hired thejnselves out as
casual cooks. In those early days they
were employed not so much to impose
their taste in food on the woman of
the house but to save her the business
of slogging over the stove when guests
were expected. The resulting meal
would be out of the rut only in that
it catered for extra mouths.
The shortest cut to perfect party-
giving today is the simple one of hiring
a gourmet to do the whole thing from
beginning to end. The only exertion
required is to lift the telephone, dial
the gourmet’s number, and tell her on
which date her services are needed. And
on the day, the hostess can stay in bed
all day if she likes, rising only in suf-
ficient time to bathe, dress, and greet
her guests for cocktails. Everything

food, staff, down to the flowers —is
taken care of.
This is the sort of service that Sue
Du Val, doyen of the Sydney gour,met
brigade, aims to provide. She is a
formidable 50-year-old who, despite her
brusqueness, has become the most
sought-after cook in the business. Her
name adds tremendous cachet to a
party, and for this reason no one tries
to pass Sue Du Val’s food off as their
own. People announce that they have
obtained her services as if they had the
Queen out there in the kitchen. Per-
haps they have, for what embarrasses
Mrs. Du Val more than anything is the
way hostesses insist on her joining the
guests. “But I have one strict rule, and
that is never to mix. The only trouble
,is they all come into the kitchen to see
me and get in the way.”
Her services are not cheap. She
charges $2O an hour “for thinking,
shopping, delivery, and doing,” reckons
Dr. H. C. Coombs ... classes
to charge $3.50 a head for a cocktail
party; for this she provides the very
best food available. She has what she
calls “a thing” about cocktail parties,
and will never use bread. People eat
too much of it. Raw beef rolled in
mayonnaise, perhaps, but no bread.
Disgusting stuff. After much fumbling
in the back of her diary she produced
an aide memoire to the effect that
dinner might cost $lO a-head. She
read that for two parties of 60 people
recently she charged $l2OO dollars, of
which she spent $BOO herself. “You
see,” she said, “I never do anything on
the cheap. To some people Boeuf a la
Mode is just a stew; to me it takes
days of preparation and marination.”
The way she works is to prepare all
the food in her home at Woollahra, take
it in her red-carpeted grey van to the
client’s house, and there, with her own
staff, trained by herself, she arranges it
all. She stays to the end of the party “to
make sure nothing walks out,” and is
vague about the number of hours she
puts in, reckoning, perhaps, to arrive at
about 4 p.m. for a dinner-party for 60.
Sue Du Val is very particular whom
she cooks for, and quoted as an example
the woman who telephoned and asked
how much a dinner for four would
cost. She dislikes cooking for four,
anyway, preferring eight, but worked
out an estimate. Oh, well, what about
my doing the pudding? asked the
woman. And that, Mrs. Duval said,
finished her. She suggested that the
woman go elsewhere.
Sue Du Val also teaches. She charges
$6 a lesson, with a minimum of four to
be taken. For this fee pupils are taught
a three-course meal, provided with
materials, and they down it all at the
end. She says she is a strict disciplin-
arian (one ex-pupil said her lessons
were “a riot,” so here is a conflicting
view), and if a mayonnaise curdles the
pupil stays until he or she gets it
right. She once told the editor of
“Vogue Australia,” Sheila Scotter, to
leave the room for talking clothes with
another pupil. “They come to learn
about cooking and food besides, it’s
bad manners to talk when being
taught.” She also insists on homework,
and everyone must practise what she
Sue Du Val... doyen
preaches at the lessons. But for all her
sternness, pupils travel miles to join her
course. One came from Canberra twice
a week, another from a town 350 miles
away.
Sue Du Val started cooking for a
well-known school in London that she
would rather we did not mention be-
cause it was so terrible. She became
the first woman guest chef at the Dor-
chester in Park Lane, through an intro-
duction from friend gastronome Andre
Simon “do you know, there was one
man there who did nothing but cut
grapefruit into segments, year in, year
out, and another who placed the glace
cherries on them?” then returned to
Australia in 1958, where her talent, in-
herited from a French grandmother,
launched her on the gastronomical
road.
Her kitchen, unsmart but comfort-
able, is designed for teaching, and the
walls on one side are covered with sig-
natures of famous people, i.e., Nureyev,
Fonteyn, Andre Simon. On the other
side is a picture of a fat, nude woman,
and when the ladies from the North
Shore come for their lessons she points
at it and says, “That’s what cooking

does for you.” They giggle and think
it’s her.
We sampled Mrs. Du Val’s cooking
(she cooks rich food all day, prefers
to eat simple grills on her own or
when out, but when entertaining does
“the full bit”) and remarked that the
quennelles, oysters, beef, pears with
strawberry sauce were superb. Mrs.
Du Val said it was all disgusting. Her
maid had left the oven door open at a
crucial stage and ruined it all.
In the telephone book Sue Du Val is
listed as “Gastronome.” This was a
joke played on her by her son, who
put it on the telephone directory form
when she wasn’t looking. Madeleine
Thurston, on the other hand, is not
listed at all, and getting her services
for a dinner-party is somewhat compli-
cated: one has to leave a message for
her at Jarman’s, the Edgecliff wine
merchant.
There may be a method in this
Mr. Len Evans... a touch of flamboyance
apparent madness, for on sale, sugges-
tively near the wine, is a new arrival
on the gastronomic scene: Mrs. Thurs-
ton’s frozen French food, attractively
packed in foil containers on which are
stuck her “Itinerant Cook” black-and-
white labels. Each pack contains suffi-
cient for two people, and the range
(six in all: Boeuf a la Mode, Coq au
Vin, Boeuf Bourguignon, Poulet a la
Creme, Blanquette de Veau, and Vic-
toria Mussels selling from one dollar
to just over two dollars) is purposely
chosen so people don’t have to fix lots
of accompanying things either rice,
baby potatoes, or salad. Mrs. Thurston
thinks the Australian palate has
changed and that those not of the
sausage-and-mash brigade do not re-
quire huge plates filled with half the
garden.
She began production after Christ-
mas, psychologically timed when people
would be sick of turkey and plum
pudding, and their palates ready for
the sophistication of French food. How
to capture these palates appeared some
problem until, passing friend John Jar-
man’s shop, she thought that where the
taste for wine had developed so the
taste for French cuisine will. What is
more natural than if they buy wine
to follow through and buy her food,
too.’ (Mr. Jarman reports a weekly
sale of at least 100 units. Mrs. Thurs-
ton reports his mark-up the usual
33 1 -3rd percent, her own a 100 per-
cent “though there are some in the
restaurant trade who say you should
work at least at 200 percent profit, but
I am not greedy, and think 100 percent
jolly good.”)
Ten years ago this food would not
have been packaged and sold (another
gourmet cook, Mrs. Elah Lowe, is
launching her frozen haute cuisine
under “Elah Lowe’s Gourmet Delica-
cies,” so there may soon be umpteen
culinary delights for non-cooks to pass
off as their own) and, as well as Jar-
man’s, Mrs. Thurston has two other
Double Ray outlets and a couple more
on the North Shore. “It’s not that
women are lazier in the kitchen, they
are bored silly with having to produce
meals three times a day,” she asserts.
To keep up her output she works
solidly from nine to three in the kitchen
of a Paddington restaurant every day.
She has twin 17-year-old sons who
come home from school and stick on
labels, and one four-year-old at kinder-
garten who comes home and gets under
everyone’s feet.
Mrs. Thurston’s party-cooking experi-
ences do not sound the gayest on
record. She never emerges from a

fidence in herself would hire a person
to cook for her.
Her own confidence in her ability
as a cook was shattered when, as a
much younger woman (she is now 46),
she went to France. She did the prac-
tical course at the Cordon Bleu, travel-
led to New York, London, Italy, ended
up cooking at the Bistro. “Restaurant
cooking is exhausting, my shoulders are
so broad now from automatically lifting
pots weighing 20 to 301 b. I’m as strong
as an ox. But I left all that when
customers asked me to cook private
dinners.”
She has no idea how many people
are on her books, but always seems to
be “on the go.” Her system is to sug-
gest two or three menus, then she shops
for food, returns, and cooks it in the
client’s kitchen. Her charge is $2 a
head, plus cost of food, for a small
Margaret Fulton. .. cook’s tour
party, less for larger ones. A party of
30, for instance, would be about 85
cents per head, when dishes are the
easy-to-eat “mushy” kind: bacon things,
with rice and strips of beef.
The biggest headache for the gourmet
cook is keeping up a continually
fresh repertoire. One man said his
heart sank when he saw Madame X
with her white-coated minions rushing
through a front door because it meant
ghastly chicken and rice again. A
woman we know went to six functions
in a fortnight and at every one had the
same veal dish.
"Someone like Margaret Fulton, who
writes for “Woman’s Day” and also
teaches cookery twice a week at a
bistro, is able to travel and gain inspira-
tion. She has been east, west, north, and
south of the globe and is off again
shortly in quest of new dishes. We are
not too sure where, she speaks (like
most gourmet cooks) so rapidly. This
is probably an occupational hazard that
comes from continual lecturing. She
has either just been or is just going
to Finland, Tahiti, Mexico, Spain,
Honolulu, but doubtless not in that
order. She thinks Mexican food the
next to be in fashion, but had we
tried a raw Tahitian fish salad? It
was delicious. And people who kept on
serving Chicken a la King were just
behind the times, and terribly staid in
their ways.
For the good of everyone’s digestion
it is vital that the whole of Sydney
do not become inundated with one pop
menu, as seemed the danger last year
when the do-it-themselves hostesses all
went mad about Filet de Boeuf, fol-
lowed by Strawberries Romanoff.
Despite this point of view, or per-
haps because of it, crash courses in
cooking coupled with wine apprecia-
tion flourish in Sydney. The more
courses there are the merrier, we hope,
everyone will be. Gretta Anna, who is
formally known as Mrs. Teplitzky and
is the wife of a doctor of psychology,
returns to the field of teaching haute
cuisine “by popular request.” She ran
a school of cookery for seven years in
the city, also did a couple of television
shows for four years, and a radio pro-
gram for two years. She then rested for
two years, looking after two young
children, but with 4000 old pupils on
her books clamoring for her return
she can resist the urge no longer. She is
reopening her classes in the restaurant
Gretta Anna at Killara, named after
her when she had a share in it, but with
no connection now. Her charge, for five
lessons, has upped from $9 to $lO.
Mrs. Teplitzky thinks of herself as
a French cook, but has no diplomas.
She has worked in kitchens of 20 well-
known restaurants i.e., 21 Club, New
York; Caprice, London; Doro’s, San
Francisco and embarked on, but did
not finish, a Cordon Bleu class in
Paris. What struck her about the Cor-
don Bleu was “the jolly waste of time
it was for most people, how impracti-
cal. What housewife has the time and
patience to do all those steps?” she
said.
She plans two courses, both new:
Winter and Summer Courses, providing
menus for both seasons. As before, her
pupils will sit at tables and sip coffee
while she demonstrates before them. In
the old days she had the room wired
for sound and spoke into a microphone
round her neck. “One other lass demon-
strating cooking got throat cancer from
non-stop talking. I thought that was very
interesting, and got myself a mike.” In
all seven years she had only one flop,
when the egg-whites wouldn’t beat up
and she had to send for more.
Mrs. Teplitzky achieved discipline
without, she said, being a schoolmarm.
The secret was to work flat out, from
the time they came to the time they
went, and always, in case of emerg-
ency, have something up her sleeve to
get their attention back.
Len Evans, who is leaving his job
as Director of the Wine Bureau at the
end of May, has also risen to affluence
in the culinary world certainly not
as rapidly as Mr. Kerr, but he is doing
very nicely all the same. He is an

English-born Welsh ex-golf professional
who, eight years ago, washed glasses
in the Ship Inn at Circular Quay,
Sydney. After a month’s holiday with
his parents in England next June, he
returns to Australia to become what
he calls “an entrepreneur of wine and
food.” He says this means he is going
to co-ordinate wine and food to give
value and make money.
“The first thing I am going to do is
to be retained as a wine consultant by a
brewery to advise on purchasing and
merchandising in their hotels,” he said.
“They have 40 or 50, and I will teach
the managers how to sell and co-
ordinate sales. This is very similar
work to what I did at the Chevron
Hotel (where he became assistant
general manager). I then become a
wine merchant around August. I will
also become a wine negociant, which is
new in Australia. This means that I
sell and promote quality wines to
restaurants and retail outlets, not
necessarily the ones I am handling.
And I shall also continue to be a wine
writer.”
As far as the wine bit goes, sales
have increased enormously in the past
ten years. John Jarman, president of
the Retail Spirit Merchants’ Associa-
tion, compares 1,935,000 gallons of
table wine sold in June, 1955, with
5,836,000 gallons in June, 1965. Where
he was taking at his own wine shop
$lOO,OOO five years ago, he now takes
over $260,000. The trend is going up
continually. In 1965/66, 22 percent
more wine was ordered compared with
the previous year.
“Women order it on the telephone
as a matter of course when they’re
doing the weekly shopping list,” he
says, but warns that as demand in-
creases so does the search (presumably
his) for good wine. People who keep
wine as a hobby have to search really
hard. Where do they find it? “They
need to have friends,” he replies enig-
matically. It is worth while noting,
then, John Jarman’s tip that the wine of
the future is Rose.
The climate, he says, is just right
for it.
So,- with acknowledgements to John
Betjeman:
Phone for the gourmets, Norman,
I feel the urge coming on
To give a party for Sonia,
Who returns after two days in Hong
Kong.

And I know our overdraft’s grim;
But now Our Set lives graciously
We must tighten our belts and give
in.
Remember, it’s worth it, Angel,
Whatever the bill at the end.
Without Gracious Living at home,
dear,
How on earth can we count on a

TRADING WITH OUR NEIGH-
BORS, II —SECOND OF A SERIES
OVERSEAS
We should give the Indonesian
Economy a fair go
By PETER SAMUEL
WE CANNOT EXPECT to begin trad-
ing on any large scale with Indonesia,
or to find a mass market among her
100 million people, until the Indonesian
economy recovers from the effects of
the “old order.”
But in my recent visit to Djakarta I
found ample evidence that this time
may come sooner, perhaps, than many
of us think.
There was, for instance, a conver-
sation with an economist of the “New
Order.”
“Yes, sometimes I think it is all a
dream,” he exclaimed, as I took the
conversation out of the present and
future tenses and switched it back to
the Sukarno era.
I had expressed surprise at what
seemed utter transformation in the
political outlook of the Indonesian
people in the past 18 months.
“Of course, it was never quite the
lunatic asylum it must have looked like
from the outside,” he said, backtrack-
ing a little.
“Plenty of people made jokes about
those stupid monuments which Sukarno
inflicted on Djakarta and the enthusi-
asm for Confrontation was very arti-
ficial.
“We must remember also that the
last year has seen a giant exercise in
national education. The new order had,
of course, developed its slogans and
simplifications, but it has released, in
small digestible doses, a huge amount
of information on the old regime.
“People knew the country was run-
ning deep into debt, but they were
still shocked when the figures were
worked out. People suspected that the
leaders of the old order enriched them-
selves, and lived well, but now they
have been given estimates of the
amount these people have in Swiss
bank accounts.
“But you are right, the change in
the political climate is amazing.”
The visitor to Djakarta is struck by
the ascendancy of “New Order” think-
ing, as expressed by men such as Adam
Malik, Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX,
and their followers. Their attempt to
make a break with Sukarno’s economic
frivolities goes impressively deep.
They have implemented two series
of very severe and therefore unpopular
austerity measures designed to put a
halt to six years of spiralling economic-
degeneration.
The first wave in October last year
was designed to stop things getting
worse. Inflation, which had been tun-
ning at 30 percent a month, was ex-
pected to approach 100 percent unless
action was taken. Government revenues
only covered a quarter of its spending,
the shortfall being met by calling for
greater efforts from the printing presses
a reason perhaps why it has been
found impossible to produce any tele-
phone directories since 1961. Severe
credit restrictions were imposed, bank
interest rates going up threefold to 15
percent a month. Tax collection was
taken seriously and revenues for the
calendar year 1966 got just over half-
way to covering expenditures. Foreign
exchange rates were made more realis-
tic and obstacles to exporting removed.
Some Government businesses put up
their charges, but the basic problem re-
mained. They were still ridiculously
low. You could rent a telephone in
Djakarta for less than five cents a
month, and there was no charge for
individual calls. If you could put up
with the milling crowd you could travel
by train from one end of Java to the
other for three cents. Petrol was the
equivalent of a cent and a half a gal-
lon. And so you could go on.
The result of this was, first, a gross
distortion of the price structure, with
disproportionate demands being put on
Government businesses. The use of
privately produced fuels was being
abandoned in favor of highly subsidised
petroleum products, for instance, and
the exportable surplus declined. Public
transport operated at an immense loss,
undercutting and putting out of busi-
ness any private companies that might
have supplemented its services. On top
of this the Government had to find
the money to subsidise or cover the
losses involved, and this was a major
element in the yawning Government
deficit. This year it was estimated that
subsidies to Government business under-
Foreign Minister Adam Malik
takings would cost 20 billion rupiahs,
as much as the 500,000 army and the
bloated bureaucracy together.
The second wave of the stabilisation
came on February 10 this year Gov-
ernment business charges going up from
200 percent to 800 percent. These
measures really hit the ordinary people.
Kerosine, the nation’s main cooking and
lighting fuel, went up 250 percent in
price, bus fares and inter-island ship-
ping fourfold, and so on.
Officials say that with this latest
round of price rises the business enter-
prises of the Government should cover
their costs, and they insist that any
which do not will simply be closed
down.
When it is remembered that for
years Indonesia has been portraying
foreign business as the root of all evil,
its new liberal attitude is remarkable.
It has enacted a foreign investment law
as encouraging to investors as any. This
reserves some public utilities, the mass
media, and defence production to local
capital and provides for joint ventures
in mining, but otherwise places no ob-
stacles in the way of foreign business.
Sensibly, it insists that Indonesians be
employed wherever possible and other-
wise that training facilities be provided
so that locals may eventually occupy
responsible positions. Generous tax
concessions and import duty exemptions
are offered.
And to prove its good intentions to-
ward foreign capital, negotiations are
going on to rectify grievances which
arose from Sukarno’s expropriation
policy. A settlement has been reached
with the Dutch, providing compensatory
payments over a period of years for
the estates taken from them, and most
industrial firms are being handed back
to their owners. The Naspro factory
owned by the Australian Nicholas firm
was the first settlement, and all foreign
properties are to be returned by April 1.
Indonesia’s foreign policy, being a
manifestation of Sukarno’s Chauvinism,
has been transformed into a pragmatic

means to the predominant national
ends rehabilitation and development
of the economy. Following the Com-
munist coup attempt, anti-Communist
feeling has naturally run high, and
there has been a good deal of advocacy
of Indonesia joining ASPAC or other
military alliances. The present Govern-
ment has not ruled this out, but for
some time to come its foreign policy-
looks like being firmly “economy
oriented.” That will dictate, among
other things, tolerably good relations
with the Russians and East Europeans,
who have $1.4 billion of credits over
Indonesia’s head and are a potential
source of future aid. Relations have
already been made difficult by the
suppression of Communists, the ban-
ning of the local party, and a law
against the “propagation of Marxism.”
Any military alliance could be the
last straw.
I was told on good authority in
Djakarta that the Government has re-
cently concluded an agreement with
Russia almost identical with the agree-
ment with Western creditor nations on
the rescheduling of its debt repay-
ments. This provides for a postpone-
ment of current repayments until 1971,
with an understanding that uncomplet-
ed civilian aid projects will be resumed
after a period. No publicity is being-
given to this agreement at Soviet re-
quest, for they fear that this would
provide the Chinese with yet another
Indonesian women transplanting rice, pre-Bimas
propaganda stick to beat them with, in
intra-Communist polemics.
Indonesia still has to repay the $2.4
billion debt run up by Sukarno, and
this will involve her in an annual loss
of over $2OO million in the 1970 s and
early 1980 s. Since export earnings are
currently running at only $550 million,
this represents a very considerable
drain.
In 1967 there are pressing immedi-
ate problems. The new agreements with
oil companies should enable oil pro-
duction to be increased a bit, and the
drastic rise in domestic prices should
lead to some reduction in local con-
sumption, producing a worthwhile in-
crease in the exploitable surplus. But
otherwise theie is little piospect fot
increasing expoi t income,
On the other hand, imports have to
be maintained if rehabilitation of the
economy is to begin. The World Bank
sent a survey mission to Indonesia in
October last year and they published
a list of recommended imports for
three key sectors. It is a cheese-paring
report. It provides nothing whatsoever
for development in 1967; that is, no
new projects are to be begun. In


addition, replacement of old plant is
to be kept to an absolute minimum.
The emphasis is entirely on providing
the foreign exchange to get spare parts
for equipment which is out of oper-
ation, and providing the raw materials
which cannot at present be produced
locally but which are essential for
existing equipment to be fully used.
Thus no new motor vehicles are to be
imported, but sllm. has been recom-
mended for spares and tyres to get the
70,000 out-of-action vehicles on the
roads again.
It also selects some quick-yielding
projects which also save foreign ex-
change. The most spectacular example
is support for the so-called “Bimas
Project,” started on a small scale by the
Indonesians in 1966. It is raising rice
output spectacularly by an intensive
application of seed selection, fertiliser,
and insecticides, the whole project being
supervised by Agriculture faculty
students. The World Bank mission sup-
ports the Indonesian Government’s
plan to increase the area covered by the
project to 1,000,000 hectares from the
300,000 hectares last season. It calcu-
lates on the basis of Last year’s results
that one million tons can be added to
the nation’s rice harvest if this is done.
This would be a ten percent boost in
food supplies, and it would eliminate
entirely the need for imports. It would
save $l4O million of foreign exchange.
The cost of the project, however, is a
mere $23,250,000 slBm. for 200,000
tons of fertilisers, $4.5m. for insecti-
cides, and $750,000 for 25,000 sprayers.
Some 700 jeeps and other equipment
are required for extension officers, but
the Indonesian Army will provide these.
On the advice of the IMF and the
World Bank, the Western creditor
nations of the Tokyo Club have now
agreed that Indonesia needs aid this
year adding up to $2OO million. (The
Indonesian Government had asked for
$295 million.) This is apart from
emergency relief aid already given.
The Tokyo Club had its third meet-
ing last week in Amsterdam, and the
Indonesian Government was hoping
that it would be a pledging session
from which it would be able to get a
definite commitment.
Unfortunately, it turned out to be
mainly a review of the progress being
made in the Government’s stabilisation
program. Officially no promises were
made. Unofficially, however, the Ameri-
cans announced they were prepared to
put up $65 million, or half the amount
of all the other free-world countries
combined. The next meeting will be
held in late May.
In the normal course of events, our
Government would not need to decide
what it will give until then. A late
decision would also fit in with the
annual budget-making timetable, as laid
down by the Treasury.
But to an outsider, an early and
imaginative decision seems to be attrac-
tive. In private diplomatic negotiations
our Government has been taking a lead
in organising the Aid-Indonesia Club.
Whatever we rriay think of his domes-
tic performances, there seems to be
almost unanimous praise for our Minis-
ter for External Affairs for his behind-
the-scenes efforts on Indonesia’s be-
half. Diplomats in Djakarta say our
people have played a very significant
role, and Indonesian officials endorse
this view.
An early offer of Australian aid
would capitalise on this goodwill. Of
course it would have to be a generous
offer of, say, $l5 million or $2O
million but an offer of this size
made well before May would have a
certain “multiplier effect.” It would
put a good deal of moral pressure on
the other members of the club to add
to America’s $65 million and make up
the total of $2OO million required.
We could adopt one of the projects
recommended by the World Bank. The
Bimas project at $24 million would be
outside the range mentioned, but with
the help of New Zealand, say, it should
not be too great a burden.
The World Bank experts said the
Bimas project “should be whole-
heartedly endorsed,” and was “of top
priority.” Of course, even if Indonesia
gets its $2OO million foreign aid this
year, it is only part of the way to eco-
nomic recovery. Despite the series of
stabilisation measures, inflation has not
been halted. It has, however, been
slowed, and there is a good chance
that when adjustments are made to the
new Government, prices will be reduced
further.
There is a critical problem of extend-
ing adequate bank credit to business
for its normal operations while keeping
on the credit squeeze. The estates have
to be revived, and farmers frightened
by years of galloping inflation attracted
into the money economy to grow cash
crops for export. Frighteningly large
under-employment must be tackled, and
stupid anti-Chinese bigotry eroded
away. And the Army used for civil
construction, and the huge bureaucracy
gradually tidied up.
The hopeful factors are in the single-
mindedness with which Indonesia's
leaders are tackling the country’s econo-
mic problems. Suharto has always been
interested in development—while in the
Army he was prominent in the Civic
Mission, the Civil Aid branch of the
military. On assuming full powers in
August last he gathered around him a
team of prominent economists. Himself
chairman of the Economic Stabilisation
Committee, he meets these men each
Wednesday morning. A series of
specialised technical teams work for this
committee. No one can doubt the
seriousness with which the leadership is
concentrating on its economic problems.
They deserve to be helped to have a go.
Hong Kong
The Long-Range Question
HONG KONG’S commission of in-
quiry into the riots last April could
well have dedicated its report last week
to “the Red Guards, without whose
absence this report could never have
been written.” The point is that the
Hong Kong riots, unlike the Macao
riots in December, were in no way
organised or exploited by local Red
Guards or by mainland China. They
arose from the ferry company’s decision
to increase its first-class fare by a
penny. They extended over three days,
a curfew was imposed, one rioter was
shot dead, and three wounded, ten
policemen were injured, and nearly 300
rioters were jailed. But there was no
outside intervention of any kind.
The post-mortejn testifies gloomily to
the fact that young people grow up and
that, even in well-ordered colonies,
they do not necessarily grow up with
the same ideas that their parents had.
For the first time an official body in
Hong Kong concedes that the colony’s
government is “to some extent” out of
touch with the people. And at last a
recommendation has been made for the
decentralisation of local administration.
Without doubt a generation of locally
born Chinese has emerged in Hong
Kong which does not share its parents’
sense of escape from harsher conditions
on the mainland. Nor do they share
the consequent sense of gratitude for a
sanctuary which, whatever its continu-
ing hardships and glaring disparities of
wealth and poverty, does offer work,
security, education, and an improving
living standard.
Hong Kong, as a British colony, re-
mains useful for Peking. Direct and
entrepot trade from the mainland
fluctuates, but the dips hurt China
more than they hurt Hong Kong. The
colony is currently increasing its pur-
chase of water from Canton.
But the haunting long-range ques-
tion, which the riot report tacitly ad-
mits, persists: how long will Peking
maintain this line? If or when it de-
cides to make trouble in Hong Kong,
the elements are all there waiting. Per-
haps the Chinese intervention in Macao
in December was a dry run. In any
event, all that Chinese Hong Kong can
do is to pursue its hard-working resili-
ent life a borrowed place living on
borrowed time. The great but unavoid-
able gap in the riot investigation was
the lack of evidence and testimony from
Chinese sources. The commission’s
access to the thoughts, hopes, and fears
of the great mass of Hong Kong’s
population was negligible. The Chinese
people do not care to bare their inner
opinions in public, under either colonial
invitation or Communist compulsion.

The Dimensions of
Poverty in Australia
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
In Australia there is now beginning
to emerge a feeling that the problem
of poverty can be solved in the context
of our present resources and administra-
tive skills.
Two important contributions have
been made to locating the dimensions
of poverty in Australia in the past few
months. The most widely known is John
Stubbs’ book “The Hidden People."
The other is a project being conducted
by the University of Melbourne In-
stitute of Applied Economic Research.
Under the joint directorship of Pro-
fessors Downing and Henderson the In-
stitute is investigating the adequacy of
income and the extent, nature, and
causes of poverty in Australia.
They have defined the area to be
surveyed as identical to the metropoli-
tan area of Melbourne used by the
Bureau of Census and Statistics in the
1961 census. The area covers 46 local
government areas and 2111 census col-
lectors’ districts.
The inquiry is only into poverty w'ith-
in private dwellings. Poverty in insti-
tutions will be the subject of a separate
and differently planned inquiry.
The investigation is restricted to the
adequacy of income in relation to the
nature and size of the family for whose
needs it has to provide.
Stage 1 of the survey has consisted
of approximately 4000 randomly
selected households. These have been
interviewed using a relatively short
questionnaire which has identified those
in or near poverty at the time of the
interview. This survey is essentially a
“snap shot” picture recording the cir-
cumstances in households during the
week in which the interview took place.
The stage 2 survey consists of a ran-
dom selection of those found to be in
or near poverty. They are being re-
interviewed, using a much longer and
more detailed questionnaire inquiring
into their economic circumstances dur-
ing the past year and also factors in
their background that had combined to
bring them into poverty. There will be
more than 400 completed stage 2 inter-
views.
A remarkably high percentage of
interviews into household needs and
income were completed, about 90 per-
cent, a figure w'hich is indicative of the
professional quality of the investigation.
The survey suggested that nearly
134,000 people in the Melbourne area
are living on or below the poverty line:
about one person in 16 of Melbourne’s
population.
These figures were released by Mr.
R. J. Harper, one of the senior planners
of the project, who claimed the survey
also suggested that: Melbourne has
17,000 w'omen over 60 - spinsters,
wddows, deserted wives—trying to live
on incomes less than a poverty line of
$l4 a w'eek; 7700 men over 65 receive
less than a poverty line income of $l5
a week; Melbourne has an estimated
4000 w'idows and deserted wives trying
to keep themselves and their children
on incomes below poverty line set at
$2B a w'eek in the case of a mother
and two children; 3600 large Melbourne
families had incomes below a poverty
line fixed around $45 a w'eek in the
case of a family of husband, wife, and
four children.
Mr. Harper said last week that while
some of the results were predictable,
many investigators had been surprised
by the extent of the poverty of deserted
wives and at how often illness was a
major contributing factor amongst im-
poverished families. He added that the
survey so far suggested that mismanage-
ment, booze, and spendthrift habits were
much less common factors in contri-
buting to poverty than some people
seemed to believe.
The follow-up interviews and further
analysis of the findings is now proceed-
ing through the agency of social
workers, statisticians, and computers. A
comprehensive book will be published
on the survey in a couple of years.
The results so far, however, offer
plenty of material for Federal, State,
and local governments and private
charitable organisations. It is clear that
the blanket coverage of certain groups
through such welfare measures as hos-
pital benefits, endowment, and the
like are often uneconomical, much of
them going to the wrong people and
not enough to those in need. Equally
certain is that an immediate and sub-
stantial rise in old-age pensions for
pensioners paying rent and in widows'
and deserted wives’ benefits would slice
heavily into the present pockets of
poverty. Higher child endowment pay-
ments to large families, after a means
test screening, is another obvious
measure of economic relief.
Properly applied, such increased
Social Service payments should not be
so high as to strike terror into the upper
rooms of the Commonwealth Treasury.
The situation in Australia is rather dif-
ferent from that of the United States,
where poverty tends to be centred more
in geographical areas and racial groups.
President Johnson’s attempt at a war
against poverty faces much larger
obstacles than would a similar admini-
strative program in Australia.
The American Congress has so far
responded generously to the finances of
the Great Society and its Office of
Economic Opportunity. It should not
be beyond Australia to construct a
fairly good society, or at least a mod-
erately charitable one. Research,
imagination, and money are needed to
conquer poverty in Australia, and the
hist two are relatively more important.
The last, however, may prove the hard-
est to procure. As the advice goes to
widows in the “Beggars Opera": “Do
like other widow's. Buy yourself weeds
and be cheerful.’’
As an emotional backing for such
considerations we can remember the
kind of case histories given by John
Stubbs. Mrs. Sarah Murphy, for
example.
According to Stubbs, Mrs. Murphy
lives in a dark, narrow', terrace house
in a Sydney suburb. She is often
hungry, sometimes cold, and almost
blind. She is not always sure what day
it is. She hopes that it is not a public
holiday, because she is expecting lunch
from the Sydney City Council’s meals
on w'heels service.
Now 72, Mrs. Murphy lost her hus-
band three months ago and depends
entirely on an old-age pension of $l3
and Supplementary Assistance of $2 per
week. When her husband was alive
they could afford the rent of $9, and
even had a small savings account, but
the latter vanished in funeral and medi-
cal expenses for her husband, and now
she has only $6 a week left for food,
clothes, light, gas, and wood. Travel-
ling is beyond her hopes and desires.
Buying a newspaper to read is presum-
ably a major economic decision. She
is not mentally or physically capable of
organising new lodgings. If it w'ere not
for meals on wheels she would prob-
ably die in 12 months of malnutri-
tion. Without company, entertainment,
locomotion, adequate warmth, and food
her life is only on the border-line of
the human.


How do you steer a cable ship
with your arms folded?
Automatic navigation at work. C. S. Mercury is just one of the ships in the Cable
& Wireless fleet fitted with automatic steering equipment made by S. G. Brown
Ltd. It incorporates the Arma-Brown gyro-compass, the smallest of its type in
existence. The accuracy and speed of response of this equipment simplifies the
complex manoeuvres called for in cable work.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
S. G. Brown —that’s the name for automatic steering
gear. It sets ships on the selected course and keeps
them there. No hands needed. Hawker Siddeley build
this equipment at the S. G. Brown factory in Watford,
England. Ships throughout the world rely on it.
The world relies on Hawker Siddeley in many
other ways, too —through the wide range of tech-
nological products that make Hawker Siddeley a
world-size industrial group.
These products go down on the farm —haul trains
—probe space—build and equip power stations —
power ships—roll roads —fly people—store heat —pack
food —transform electricity—fuel aircraft —and main-
tain a daily turnover of over $A2| million.
Navigation equipment is part of this turnover, but
only part. That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a
group. With group power.

The QUESTION of NED KELLY'S
PERRUME
In a footnote to a recent letter to Charles Higham, Norman
Lindsay wrote: “P.S.: By the way, I noticed, in a newspaper some
time back, an assumption by Mr. Sydney Baker that there was
evidence of homosexuality in Ned Kelly because of the use of per-
fume. If you would care to have it I will send you a comment on
this matter of perfume which disposes of the use of it by Ned Kelly
as any evidence of homosexuality
We invited Mr. Lindsay to give us his observations.
AS I live outside the postal delivery
area, which also includes deliver'}
of the daily newspaper, I rarely
see one, unless it arrives as tradesmen’s
wrapping paper. It was, therefore, only
by the courtesy of my butcher that I
read of Mr. Sydney Baker’s stigmatisa-
tion of Ned Kelly as a homosexual
which so justly outraged the citizens
of Jerilderie, a township which reveres
Ned as its national hero.
I have not read Mr. Baker’s work on
the new Australian Language, which
contains his assumption of Ned Kelly’s
homosexuality, but if, as I understand,
it is based on the use of perfume by
Ned, and that the Gang was given to
selecting each other as dance partners,
then Mr. Baker is accusing a very large
section of the male population of the
Kelly era as homosexuals.
I was born in that era, being, I
think, about the age of eight when Ned
was hanged, but I am not to be relied
on in respect of dates. And I don't think
BUSH LIFE: INSIDE A TAVERN: “The Queensland Bush tavern is a terribly fascinating
spot to the shepherd or stockmen who have led a solitary life for many months, drinking nothing
stronger than tea. The shepherd’s wages are paid him by cheque; he tramps many weary miles
to the nearest bush tavern, places the cheque in the proprietor’s hands and often does not leave the
establishment until every halfpenny of his earnings has disappeared. This is called ‘doing his pile ’”
any trial at law, before or since that
of Ned Kelly, has taken possession of
the Australian people with such a pas-
sionate intensity. It touched on a con-
tent of the national ego which is as
potent today as in Ned Kelly’s time,
and that is the amalgam of reckless
man and dangerous man, which be-
comes heroic man when a people is
threatened by war or conflict with other
nations. This is in part the theme of
Douglas Stewart’s superb verse drama
Kelly.
And no section of the population of
this country was more obsessed by the
exploits of the Kelly Gang than the
small boys of my generation. With us
the eternal game of cops and robbers
became that of Police and Bushrangers,
We played it to the exclusion of all
other diversions, though with consider-
able grudging from the junior mem-
bers of my nonage, of which I was
one, for we were forced to sustain the
role of police, while our elders took
over that of the Kelly Gang, who, with
the unerring marksmanship of cork-
popping pistols, shot down the ignoble
police to a man.
We had the whole saga of the Kelly
Gang from my father’s groom, Dennis
Denny, who claimed to possess Dan
Kelly’s saddle, though how he came
to inherit this historic relic was not
revealed. I see him now, seated on the
chaff bin, surrounded by an admiring
group of small boys, while he recounts
to us how the police would have had
Kate Kelly for what that era solemn-
ised as a fate worse than death, and of
how Dan Kelly, nobly defending his
sister’s honor, shot a policeman in the
arm. Or was it that the policeman
shot himself in the arm in order to
prove a case of criminal assault against
Dan, forcing him to take to the bush
and join his big brother Ned, who had
already fled there to escape a pumped-
up charge of horse-stealing by the
malignant police?
I have reverted here to the bio-
graphical, as it is essential to refuting
the charge against Ned Kelly of homo-
sexuality because he used perfume.
Nearly all men of that era, irrespective
of class, used perfume. My father, an
Irishman, a horse and buggy doctor,
and as dominant a male as ever wore
whiskers, always finished off his morn-
ing toilet by dabbing his handkerchief
freely with perfume. When my parents
gave a dinner party it was the men
guests who loaded the atmosphere with
perfume and hair oil. It was, in fact,
almost a male prerogative, for women,
or those who classified themselves as
ladies, used very little perfume. At
most, a lady dressing for any social
event dabbed a little eau-de-cologne-


By NORMAN LINDSAY
“How else work off the exhilaration of liquor ...?"
behind her ears. A woman who over-
did the use of a scent bottle was con-
sidered “fast.”
Men had other rituals which if prac-
tised today would make them suspects
of a sexual kink. They wore a con-
siderable amount of jewellery, heavy
signet rings, jewelled tie-pins, watch-
chains from which dangled lockets,
medals, charms, and other trinkets.
Also they wore flowers in the button-
hole, nosegays they called them, and
some perfectionists, to keep the
flowers fresh, had their stems inserted
into a small bottle of water fastened by
clips under the lapel.
Here I have dealt only with the
gentry. Let me turn, then, to the toilet
of one of our many grooms, for, like
most tolerably decent small boys of
that era, the stable was for me a
chosen domicile within the home and
the company of grooms preferable to
that of other members of the home
circle. The groom I have in mind was
a notable member of the local football
team, and, in his own estimation, an
amorist of distinction among the pro-
fessional tarts from Ballarat who fre-
quently weekended at a sort of bor-
dello run by old Jimmy Ah Wah at
our Chinese camp. Herewith is his
Saturday night’s toilet, for that was
the week’s gala night, when shops and
pubs remained open late.
It began with a stiffly starched white
shirt, a polo collar, and a narrow, red
tie fastened to his shirtfront with a
brass clip. He then inserted his stock-
inged feet into a pair of bell-bottomed
pants which were too skintight at the
knees to permit the passage of boots.
His boots were very elaborate, with
high heels, decorative toecaps, and
brass lace-up tags. His coat was of the
flash pattern known as a ducktail, be-
cause it had two buttons designed to
cock its tail upwards, while its very
small lapels made another class dis-
tinction from the long-tailed coats of
the gentry with their wide spread of
lapels.
But the culmination of his toilet was
the way he brushed his well-oiled hair.
This was parted at the side and brushed
down in a curve over his forehead.
With that he placed a forefinger about
midw'ay on the curve and brushed the
ends of the hair upwards in a curve
over his finger. When this was ad-
justed to his satisfaction he carefully
inserted into the curve the tail feathers-
of a drake to preserve its upward curl.
His high-crowned boxer hat was ad-
justed about an inch above it so that
the brim should protect this final per-
fection of his toilet. It need hardly be
added that the perfume bottle was up-
ended on his handkerchief that he
might go forth imposing on all noses
an aroma of the barber’s shop.
I am not implying a lack of erudi-
tion in Mr. Baker that he failed to dis-
cover that perfume was a propem
common to all men of the period he
deals with, because I had forgotten it
myself till he called it back to memory.
When digging up material about any
past period the hardest data to unearth
is that of the trivialities which writers,
in the period rarely record, because
they are conventions accepted as under-
stood by their readers.
The reason for a lavish use of per-
fume all through the Victorian era is.
not far to seek. Anyone who reads
"Bleak House" or Henry Mayhew’s
documentation of London life during
the ’fifties will realise how much the
squalor of the slums impinged on all
main thoroughfares. Even in those the
open drains were clogged with refuse,
so that the whole atmosphere must have
been equally clogged with stenches,
carrying with them the germs of
typhoid and cholera. In such a miasma
men, hurrying about their affairs, had
no other resource but to clap a hand-
kerchief loaded with perfume to their
noses.
In answer to Mr. Baker’s other infer-
ence of homosexuality in men dancing
together, I have appended to this article
a couple of woodcuts from journals of
the 1870 s one of an exclusively male
bar-room and another of men dancing
together at a pub. How else could
they work off the exhilaration of liquor,
lacking women to dance with?
The use of perfume by men petered
out with my father’s generation. The
custom had been inherited from Eng-
land and the generic cause for it for-
gotten, since there were no city
stenches in Australia to demand a pro-
phylactic against them.


Harold Holt's Way
By PETER SAMUEL
MOST Prime Ministers work them-
selves to the grave. Menzies was,
of course, the great exception.
Holt, being a less extraordinary man,
has to work at a more evenly hard pace.
He sees a great many more detailed
papers and spreads himself over a
greater range of subjects than Menzies.
Being so much less assertive, he is
unable to bluster his way quickly
through meetings. He also spends more
time seeing people, listening to them
and expounding his views.
Menzies was naturally a loner, not
making continuous demands on his per-
sonal staff. For Holt, staff are of critical
importance, given the greater workload
he takes on. Until recently he had
numerically only .the same collection of
personal staff as other Ministers. Typi-
cally these consist of “a bag-carrier to
hang up his coat and open his letters,
a public-relations man to keep out
intruders, and a couple of girls to do
the typing,” to quote one senior public
servant.
That caricature is not to be taken
very seriously, because it lumps to-
gether very unlike individuals, and it
is not only unfair to most, but com-
pletely inaccurate about others. But
it does contain grains of truth. The
great majority of staff to Ministers
are public servants seconded from de-
partments. They have a bureaucratic
background, and they expect to go
back into the departmental stream when
they finish with the Minister. They
see their term with him as an inter-
lude, a short “special assignment”
which takes them temporarily out of
the department. Their career and
for them the idea of a career is terribly
important is with the public service.
As a result of these attitudes, most
staff avoid any real commitment to
their Minister. By temperament and
experience they are usually unable to
advise him politically. Only depart-
mental heads and a few second division
officers are experienced politickers.
Personal staff are generally recruited
from the third division. Only very few
can help creatively, suggesting new
ways of articulating policy or anticipat-
ing where the hurly-burly of general
politics may be involving the Minister
six months or a year hence. Such staff
are more an extension of the service
the department provides and a liaison
with the department than specialist per-
sonal staff. They are not specialist
politicos, they are not dedicated to the
Minister, the Party, or its philosophy,
and they are not ideas men.
Other Party leaders have broken most
from the public servant staffing tradi-
tion—Whitlam, in Menadue, Cullen and
Freudenberg, has three personal fol-
lowers, all of whom have been active
in the Labor Party and Gair with Kane
and Strangman has politically experi-
enced assistants. None of Mr. Holt’s
assistants are members of the Liberal
Party. While they say they have no
important disagreements with Govern-
ment policies, they feel no impulse to
promote the Party line.
The Prime Minister’s Press secretary,
Mr. T. Eggleton, still retains his posi-
tion in the Navy Department. He is
director of-public-relations, and officially
he is on leave from there. The PM’s
new private secretary, Mr. Peter Bailey,
as a first assistant secretary, was equal
third rank in the Prime Minister’s
Department. Regarded as an outstand-
ing public servant, he must be a strong
contender as positions of departmental
head become available through retire-
ment. After a period with the Prime
Minister he seems certain to go to one
of these jobs.
While head , of the Cabinet and
external relations division of the de-
partment, Bailey is said to have come
as near to being Mr. Holt’s speech-
writer as anyone. But Mr. Holt has
so far insisted on doing most of the
work himself. He decides on the theme
for his speeches. His Press secretary
usually goes to the department for some
notes. On more important occasions,
the Sydney or Canberra Liberal Party
office may throw something in. His
staff may weed out irrelevant material,
but Mr. Holt usually writes the finished
speech himself, taking some notes late
at night and dictating them first thing
in the morning. It is usually left late,
nothing being done more than ten days
ahead, any drafting being left until
two or three days beforehand.
Mr. Bailey will continue to con-
tribute to the speechmaking process,
but his main job will be to improve
liaison with other Ministers and help
in the office.
Mr. K. Sinclair, the other new
appointment, is in a somewhat am-
biguous position. He is a “consultant to
the Prime Minister and the Prime
Minister’s department.” He has an
office not with the personal staff in
Parliament House but in the depart-
ment, and he is said to be going to
specialise in “cultural affairs,” as well
as help with ideas for general speeches.
The first function brings him close to
the department, which has a cultural
affairs section, and the second to the
Prime Minister personally. This dual
and somewhat ambiguous role is being
criticised heavily in Canberra. The
point is made that it is quite right
and proper for Ministers to enlarge
their personal staffs, but that they
should be quite clearly officed with
them, and be unambiguously respon-
sible to the Minister direct.
In this case there is a feeling that
the department may have been done out
of a new senior staff position in order
to find the money for Sinclair. The
department is already sparsely staffed.
When the Johnson visit was on all but
two of its three dozen officers had to
drop everything in order to work on
the tour. Those two were involved in
making the arrangements for the
Manila talks. In cases such as this the
department’s routine work ceases,
including the important functions such
as resolving interdepartmental disputes,
organising joint meetings, and provid-
ing a stream of general information
and advice to the Prime Minister.
Mr. Holt has only ynade a tiny step
forward. He has none of the sort of
men with whom most national leaders
surround themselves these days. But it
is a beginning.
NEXT WEEK, from Alan Reid —a full-scale cover
story report on the changes in Holt’s Canberra.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMFNT
The Pied Piper plays again
By PATRICIA ROLFE
ONE OF THE great successes of the
radio age, “The Pied Piper” program,
is now being produced for television.
The television program, made by the
Willard King organisation, is being
shown in four States. The program is
compered by Keith Smith, who devised
the original radio program and who
thinks he is probably the “last of the
ad-libbers.”
There were, in fact, two similar pro-
grams “A Word from Children,”
which ran for about ten years on the
ABC, and “The Pied Piper” program,
which also ran for about ten years,
overlapping “A Word from Children”
on commercial radio. It is still, in fact,
being replayed, perhaps to the occas-
ional embarrassment of former partici-
pants, now adult, at various places
around the Commonwealth.
The style of the two programs varied
slightly, but the basis was Smith’s
ability to beguile children into speak-
ing naturally and frankly into a micro-
phone. Smith believes he had a formula
for this and that his formula wall work
for television, too. But he will not say
how he does it. “If I did there would
be Pied Pipers all over the place,” he
said. There was, of course, another Pied
Piper Art Linkletter in the United
States but Smith says he had never
heard of him until “A Word from
Children” was several years old.
“People in this country always think
that if you get a good idea, you must
have stolen it from overseas,” he said.
The radio program over the years
built up a vivid and varied picture of
Australian domestic life, one which
could tell you more than a dozen
sociologists’ surveys. Smith feels part of
the appeal of the program for adults
was reassurance: if a child said that
Dad sometimes got boozed and hit
Mum, then thousands sighed their re-
lief that their behaviour wasn’t so
unusual after all.
Smith began his career in enter-
tainment writing wartime comedy
material, specialising in the elusive
“blackout” sketches. He then wrote
comedy material for Bob Dyer and
spent 10 years writing material for
and performing with the late, legendary
Jack Davey.
Rather, Smith might have called
Jack Davey “legendary,” but a recent
experience would give him pause. He
was in the offices of a television pro-
duction company. The company had
been searching diligently for some
months for a compere for a new quiz
program. Now a young executive burst
in with, “Hold everything. I’ve found
the man we want. I was listening to
2CH this morning and I heard him
compering a show. I made a note of
his name. Jack Davey.”
The young executive had been listen-
ing to a long-playing record of one of
Jack Davey’s old programs. It seems
something of a source of bewilderment
to Keith Smith that television learnt so
little from radio, although both are
part of entertainment, a profession
which generally carries such a strong
feeling of continuity and tradition. And
also there is bafflement that there are
inevitably, one supposes, now' that
television is 10 years old people
working in it who have never heard
of Jack Davey.
“Television learnt nothing from
radio,” he said. “And it could have.
If you can get 400 people in an audi-
ence for a radio show laughing their
heads off, you can get thousands of
people sitting in their living-rooms
w'atching television to laugh, too. What’s
the difference? And it is no use saying
audiences are more ‘sophisticated. Aus-
tralian audiences haven’t changed. They
still laugh at low' that is technically
low, not morally low comedy.
“And comedy remains the same.
These days, if the television script isn't
funny they say they are ‘playing it for
pathos.’ Or that it is ‘satire.’ If anyone
can write comedy, they’ll write it.”
Smith learnt comedy-writing in a
hard school. The scripts for the weekly
comedy show he did with Jack Davey
w'ere written by Davey, Smith, George
Foster, and Alexander Macdonald. It
seems that any combination of two
could produce a script. Often, Smith
recalls, he and Davey would begin
working at about midnight at Davey s
Bellevue Hill flat and work through
until morning. Davey would go to
Station 2GB and do his early morning
session, then the comedy program
would be recorded and they'd sleep off
their exertions in the afternoon.
For a time Smith had a television
program “Instant People.” However,
he continues to work in radio, with a
tenuous desk-and-telephone relationship
with the ABC. He does a large number
Keith Smith
of news and feature programs anc?
handles interviews with a precision
and brevity which make the average
television “in depth” interview' look
fairly ridiculous. He is too old a hand
to risk over-exposure on television and
will let the fleeting procession of chil-
dren occupy the screen most of the
time.
He has filled in a few more cracks in
the freelance’s career with writing.
His riddle books, published by Rigby’s,
have sold around 25,000 copies. They
are collections of plain, old-fashioned
“What is the difference?” riddles. “Why
should everything for children be edu-
cation?” Smith asks.
He has also written a novel, pub-
lished by Ure Smith and now in paper-
back. This is “Ogh," which he describes
as a send-up of life in the suburbs and
the way in which Australian novelists
write about life in the suburbs. For
heaven’s sake, don’t call it satire, he
implores.
Dressing the part
By CEDRIC FLOWER
NOW THAT TV is delving further
back into the Hollywood past, it is fas-
cinating to rediscover how stylised
movie clothes were. What the stars
wore was often more revealing than
the captions or the later talking. 1
remember those matinees at the old
Southern Cross, and how quickly we
picked up the clues.
Good girls had cloudy hair and wore
cotton. Bad girls had glued-down curls
and wore satin.
In Westerns you could tell by the
blouses. Heroines staved decently


buttoned up. Any girl who had one of
those off-the-shoulder affairs was
morally loose and probably had
colored blood. One bare shoulder was
bad enough. Two bare shoulders meant
sexual abandon or, in extreme cases, a
rape victim.
Men who wore waistcoats and arm-
bands were crooks or Broadway produ-
cers. (If they wore eyeshades, too, they
were in a newspaper office.) Stars like
Clark Gable would sometimes start
this way, but would be persuaded in
the end to don a coat by one of the
cotton-clad girls.
Polka dots were ambiguous. A dress
of polka dots was OK. With an
apron it signified domestic bliss. A
polka-dot blouse worn with a black
skirt was something different again.
With a beret and neck scarf it was
bound to be Claire Trevor under a
lamp-post, abandoned to sin. With
singing stars like Alice Faye it just
showed they were dead common. By
the time Alice made the big Broad-
way show she’d be all in organdie with
one tasteful diamond clasp and Don
Ameche straight from Skid Row aglow
in the wings.
Betty Grable made a regular tran-
sition from black net stockings and
honkytonks to better-type entertain-
ments and organdie. You could come in
any time during the film and know
what stage she was at by what she
was wearing.
Girls with glasses had intellectual
pretensions. They never got kissed
until they took them off.
Designers learned to do wonders
with meagre material. Early musicals
spent a lot of time on rehearsals, with
the stars tap-dancing in rompers and
blouses while the director screamed
“No, no, no!” The variations on this
costume were a test of ingenuity, but
the designers came through triumphant.
You knew at a glance that Ruby
Keeler was a shy virgin and Joan
Blondell a tramp just by the frills
on the blouse and the shine on the satin
rompers.
Male stars of the ’3os indulged in a
minor form of striptease. Once each
film they would be disclosed in
singlet, baggy underpants, black socks
and suspenders. It was no guide to
character, as nice boys like Dick
Powell were seen in deshabille as well
as sexy types like Raft and Gable.
Biblical spectacles had their own con-
ventions. The Romans were wonderfully
wicked and glamorous in rhinestones
and gold lame. The Christians shuffled
about in sacks. The Christian heroine
wore a full-sleeved nightgown, carried
a pitcher, and lived in a cellar with
a lot of character actors. Once in
every film she was abducted by the
wicked Roman and taken to an orgy.
She then wore a vaguely Grecian gar-
ment of chiffon with her hair up. But
she was back in a sack for the finale,
virtue intact. Nobody liked the Chris-
tians, especially the designer and direc-
tor. I sometimes speculate on the part
played by religious spectacles in
emptying the churches.
The problem of covering the stars
with symbolic apparel came to an end
with the big bust (circa Jane Russell).
With all eyes glued to the cleavage it
didn’t matter much what else was
worn, or even whom she was supposed
to be. These days, when the co-stars
are likely to spend most of the film
wriggling naked under the sheet, it has
all become very confusing.
There’s one thing about foreign
films. If the clothes are by Balenciaga
it’s going to be very long, sad, incon-
clusive, and have captions. If the
clothes are by Givenchy, Audrey Hep-
burn is the star and it’s in English.

A Serious Matter
By ELWYN LYNN
Architecture Without Architects. Art
Gallery of N.S.W., Sydney.
Orange Festival Prize. Community
Centre Hall, Orange, N.S.W.
THE SPLENDID EXHIBITION of
photographs at the N.S.W. Art Gallery,
first shown in November, 1964, at New
York’s Museu,m of Modern Art, were
selected, says the organiser, Bernard
Rudofsky, as a rapid review of non-
pedigree, vernacular, anonymous, spon-
taneous, indigenous or rural architec-
ture that is practically unknown, be-
cause, declares Rudofsky, architectural
history has skipped the first 50 cen-
turies and presents a formal architecture
based on great names in that art.
There are photographs of troglodyte
and tree dwellings, of eyries, of houses
mimicking rocks, of tightly packed
houses without the clogged arteries of
modern cities, of shadowed, silent
arcades, of wood and cane in vernacular
buildings, and of the windscoops of
Hyderabad Sind that keep the tem-
peratures down and are also used as
intramural telephones. Such ventilators,
like periscopes, can also be found at
Broome, and it would be interesting to
know how they arrived there.
Though the exhibition is quaint and
exotic its aim is frankly polemical,
arguing and illustrating the case for a
communal and co-operative architecture
of live and let live and for buildings
that embody social aspirations; Rudof-
sky goes so far as to describe the monu-
mental granaries as quasi-sacral, extols
the rare good sense of traditional
domestic architecture and asks why we
make our streets deserts instead of
oases. When he reminds us that Bologna
has almost 20 miles of arcades or por-
tici, we are ready to accuse the modern
architect, who wants his creations to
soar unimpeded by verandas or awn-
ings, of conspiring to have us drenched
by rain or soaked in perspiration.
One suspects that Rudofsky exag-
gerates: he suggests that a study of the
non-pedigreed, vernacular architecture
may help us with our problems, which,
since he concentrates on external
appearances, must include for him
the lack of a planned and significant
environment; but the photographs at-
tract in the same way as do Vart brut
and brutalist architecture, and though
both sides of the Opera House ven-
detta might find something in his
“Architecture is too serious a matter
to be left to the experts. Although
good architecture is occasionally con-
ceived on the drafting board, it is
truly born in the conscience of the
community,” one doubts the existence
of a community conscience when one
flips the pages of Don Gazzard’s Out-
rage or Peter Blake’s similar indict-
ment of America’s ruined environment
called God’s Own Junkyard and sub-
titled The Planned Deterioration of
America’s Landscape. The country-
side is rendered ugly, and freeways and
speedways divide the cities into office
ghettoes, industrial ghettoes, apartment
ghettoes, shopping ghettoes, and amuse-
ment or culture ghettoes. Though
Rudofsky’s fascinating photographs re-
veal a vernacular architecture that is
so necessary and efficient that it makes
much of ours look muddled, provisional
and merely expedient, can it really
indicate a way out?
Recently at Lithgow and Orange
there were Cabinet-level ceremonies to
celebrate the erection of the first traffic
lights in those towns; the glaring, yellow
totem-poles were taken as signs of
development and progress rather than
portents that the days of leisurely rural
life were drawing to a close. It was
perhaps ironic that the installation
closely preceded the Orange Festival
of Arts, which is symptomatic of the
desperate desire for country towns to
share in city culture a desire deeper
and more widespread than one
imagined; Anthony King, director of
Adult Education in Orange and its
district, has compiled a map of drama
and art groups there are over 40 of
the latter in country towns, and
they are a heartening sign of local in-
itiative, though Mr. King is justly
haunted by all those dilapidated and
usually empty Schools of Arts and
Mechanics’ Institutes decaying in
country towns.
What Orange is seeing in painting
prizes went to Jean Isherwood and
Henry Salkauskas, the latter’s dark, sus-
pended forms generating and dissolving
their own presence is a sudden
plunge into modernity with Kitching’s
lights in a disc plaque, Leach-Jones'
multi-focal disc of writhing forms, Rein-
hard’s blow-up of a headless, topless
nude photograph amid boxes, and
tough hard-edge from Vickers, Tre-
weeke, and Wendy Paramor. Vickers’

line and Roy Jackson’s roughly car-

Unheroic
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Khartoum. Director, Basil Dearden.
Is Paris Burning? Director, Rene
Clement.
TWO SPRAWLING, expensive block-
busters this week try with indifferent
success to recreate epic periods of his-
tory, but perhaps both the siege of
Khartoum and the liberation of Paris
are too big to capture even on enor-
mous screens within three long hours.
Instead of the surge and sweep of
history, the inspiration of human cour-
age and endurance, the two movies
give us some impressive photography
and a memory of admirable inten-
tions.
“Khartoum” is a highly competent
piece of film-making, with its beauti-
fully colored Cinerama photography of
the Nile and the desert and its lively
action sequences; but these are too
often interrupted by Robert Ardrey’s
prosy and didactic script. This is par-
ticularly noticeable in the scenes of
confrontation between General Gordon
and his enemy and alter ego the Mahdi.
(Incidentally, I don’t think they ever
did meet except in battle.)
Charlton Heston, who seems to be
cast automatically whenever a heroic
figure is required, is not a particularly
profound actor, though he has an un-
deniably imposing presence; but he is
hampered by the stodgy lines he has
to speak and by his own evident con-
viction that he is not a man but a
symbol of something or other. Laurence
Olivier’s lively portrait of the Mahdi
is considerably more entertaining, with
the actor communicating his own relish
in the performance to the audience.
Ralph Richardson too easily outclasses
Heston as the irascible yet believably
statesmanly Gladstone.
For all its lengthy and impressive
cast list, “Is Paris Burning?” has only
two real stars Paris herself and
photographer Marcel Grignon. They’re
a pretty impressive pair, and manage
to engage the interest considerably
more than the scrappy, fidgety plot. By
trying to say too much, Rene Clement
has dissipated the dramatic drive of
this story of the liberation of Paris,
when Hitler’s vengeful order to burn


the city to the ground was foiled as
much by the commanding German
general as by the Allies and the Resist-
ance.
Gert Froebe, who is most helped by
the script, gives a rounded and sym-
pathetic characterisation as the General.
The rest of the cast either appear as
heroic recruiting poster symbols or else
barely appear long enough to be recog-
nised, much less to establish a charac-
ter; the dubbing of much of the dia-
logue removes any hint of realism.
Theatre
Not adroit
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Left-handed Liberty. John Arden. Syd-
ney University Drama Society. Union,
Sydney.
“LEFT-HANDED LIBERTY” is a
play about Magna Carta which was
commissioned by the Corporation of
the City of London in 1965 to com-
memorate the 750th anniversary of the
signing of that document. John Arden
certainly cannot be accused of pander-
ing to his patrons, for the Lord Mayor
of London is a merchant who is con-
cerned solely with the security of trade,
while the King-curbing barons whom
he supported are an uncouth lot. But
King John emerges as a colorful per-
sonality who, when he is not being a
slippery politician, is forceful and plain
in his speech and possessed of a sense
of humor and a good measure of royal
authority. This is a very different pic-
ture from the traditional one.
However, in spite of the brightening
of King John’s image, I found this a
tedious and wordy play. There is an
unconscionable number of long speeches
punctuated by a few set pieces, such as
the scene of the three prostitutes and
the barons, or the King dispensing
rough justice to the goldsmith, his
adulterous wife, and the ballad-singing
priest who is her lover.
Then finally, after the characters
have been explaining themselves at
length throughout the play, the King
steps out of character and, by a con-
vention which seems fashionable in
modern plays, explains directly to the
audience what the play has been all
about. Someone will say this is Brech-
tian, but it could be just incompetence
in conveying the message through action
and dialogue.
Unfortunately, the play is not helped
by the production. Apart from the per-
formances of Victor Emeljanow as the
expansive John and Geoffrey Borny as
the subtle, precisely spoken papal
legate, the large cast is not up to its
task. The bearded young men who play
the rebellious barons look as though
they would be more at home in a coffee
shop than dicing and whoring in
medieval London.
Music
Singing strings
By JOHN CARGHER
Osipov Balalaika Russian Orchestra.
Her Majesty’s, Melbourne.
APPLAUSE for “God Save the
Queen,” that’s news, indeed. But then
no staid Melbourne audience has ever
heard the old dear played by “one
thousand and one singing balalaika
strings,” to quote the appropriately
pop-style advertising. The Osipov
Balalaika Orchestra is probably the
Russian equivalent of Mantovani and
His Orchestra, but the standard of
musicianship among its players is so
high that it may be admired without
shame by serious music lovers, no
matter how much they may deplore
the music chosen for us backward
Australians.
The entertainment is aimed at mass
audiences and as such it is an un-
doubted success. Yet to justify the
inclusion of singers from the Bolshoi
Theatre at least one or two operatic
items would not have hurt. To bring
Ivan Petrov, one of those gigantic
Russian bassos of whom we hear only
in legend, all the way from Moscow
to sing the “Volga Boatmen” is tanta-
mount to importing the New York
Philharmonic to play “Pop Goes the
Weasel.” As it is, the billing of “Stars
of the Bolshoi Opera and Russian
Ballet” is gravely misleading. Valentina
Levko has a most beautiful mezzo-
soprano voice and the two dancers com-
pletely capture their audience’s heart
during their two short appearances.
The stars of the Osipov Company
are its many players and their superla-
tive expertise in a field completely new
to Australia. Their range of dynamics
has to be heard to be believed. They
produce the quietest pppp I have been
fortunate almost to have heard and
the coloring obtained by the masses
of balalaikas, domras, and various other
curious but delightfully tuneful instru-
ments is quite incredible. The pro-
gram is devoted to the traditional
popular music of Russia up to and in-
cluding the school of Zhivago, pleasant
enough but certainly capable of im-
provement by better programming and
stage management.
One aspect of Osipov should bring
comfort to us: English-speaking nations
are not alone in embracing the second-
rate and gimmick in the modern pop
idiom. Ludmilla Zykina is, we are
assured, a Russian top-pop idol. Though
she looks like a traditional prima
donna, she is otherwise little different
from most members of our own pop
fraternity. In her one short group of
songs she achieved the remarkable feat
of singing, if one can call it that,
apparently with her mouth shut.
The Americans gave the world the
electric guitar. Our Russian friends
are more ambitious. The electronic
accordion, played extremely well by
Anatoli Belyaev, is equipped with all
the paraphernalia of the monsters which
used to regale us at the Regal during
the intervals between films.
Two conductors
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Con-
ductor, Moshe Atzmon, soloist, Leon-
ard Pennario. Sydney Town Hall.
LEONARD PENNARIO must be one
of the most prejudged, underrated,
and damned-with-faint-praise concert
artists of the decade. While Campoli
has finally overcome the unjustified
stigma attached to his playing, Pen-
nario—“guilty” of the same flaw of
recording commercial pop-classics
seems less fortunate. What if he re-
leases an LP entitled “I Love Beet-
hoven.” Don't we all? Last week’s per-
formance revealed that whether he loves
him or not, Pennario can play Beet-
hoven very well indeed.
From the opening solo bars of the G
major (No. 4) Concerto it was evident
that this was to be a distinctly indivi-
dual reading. They were smooth, fresh,
and immediately gripping, holding one
in tantalised anticipation throughout
the long orchestral exposition which
follows. Pennario’s shimmering re-entry
fulfilled the promise of his curious, un-
finished opening. The entire movement
was brimful of the subtle textural shad-
ings which mark a strong and cohesive
interpretation.
Unfortunately, Atzmon and the Syd-
ney Symphony seemed unwilling to
accommodate Pennario. The young
Israeli conductor chose to assert his
approach to the work on every possible
occasion and the inevitable confusion
which resulted at entries was an insult
to any soloist, particularly to one senior
and more experienced. Differences in
tempi were often so great that Pen-
nario was forced into the ridiculous
posture of having constantly to watch
the baton while playing. Torn between
what amounted to two conductors, the
orchestra compromised with hesitant,
untidy accompanying.
It was not until the second half
that Atzmon showed the qualities one
was led to expect from this up-and-
coming. While the performance of the
early Schoenberg Chamber Symphony
was notable primarily for Walter Sut-
cliffe’s virtuoso bass playing, the Schu-
mann First Symphony which followed
was very much the conductor’s affair.
Vigorous and crisp throughout, Atz-
mon’s reading injected the work with
attractive drama and vitality.

BOOKS
The Worst of Everything
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Valley of the Dolls. Jacqueline Susann.
Cassell. $4.20.
Any God Will Do. Richard Condon.
Heinemann. $3.15.
JACQUELINE SUSANN’S “Valley of
the Dolls,” critically a disaster and
commercially a gigantic success, seems
to me an unusually adroit example of
a pop novel. It is a book into which
the authoress has obviously poured a
great deal of her own experience.
Miss Susann’s heroine, Anne, is as
good-looking as Miss Susann herself; she
comes to New York looking for excite-
ment and experience. She has rejected
her staid New England background and
the only thing she is sure of is that she
doesn’t want to go back to the pro-
vincialism of her upbringing.
She goes to work in the office of a
theatrical attorney and falls in love
with Lyon Burke; as well as ,movie-star
looks Lyon has the additional charm
of an English accent. Lyon is the white
hope of the office; however, he has come
back from the war discontented. His
real wish is to write a novel about
his war experiences, and he regards his
work at the office as an impediment.
Anne is taken up by Helen Lawson,
the queen of the Broadway musical
stage, as her confidante, and her hand
is also sought by one of the wealthiest
men in New York. (All this admittedly
seems a little too- sugary and wonder-
ful.) The friendship of Helen Lawson
(otherwise known as “Old Ironsides”)
and Anne seems too easy and improb-
able. However, Miss Susann rapidly
pricks the bubble. Lt turns out that
Helen Lawson has only been interested
in Anne because she leads to the father
of the wealthy young man who is pur-
suing her. When Anne dumps him for
Lyon Burke, the dashing theatrical at-
torney, “Old Ironsides” quickly termin-
ates her friendship with Anne and shows
her ugliest aspects.
Anne forms friendships with two
other women who also become central
characters. She gets to know young
Neely, a member of a vaudeville song-
and-dance team. Neely is completely
unsophisticated and unspoilt, naive but
enthusiastic about sex, and is devoted
to the theatre. She appears at first to
be an excessively cute young thing
straight out of “Annie Get Your Gun,
but when she becomes a phenomenally
successful film star, she becomes a mon-
ster, jettisoning her closest friends. She
becomes completely dependent on
“dolls” or pills to sedate her and to
stimulate her. The savage encounter
between her and Helen Lawson in later
life is excellently managed.
Neely eventually lands up in an
asylum, but is able to make a come-
back and keeps herself on the straight
and narrow until success goes to her
head and her egomania breaks out
again.
The other girl whom Anne meets is
Jennifer, not gifted with the mercurial
talent of Neely but is a responsive,
highly sexed woman unremarkable
except for her body. She has numerous
abortions and at the moment when she
is closest to fulfilment tragedy inter-
venes rather melodramatically.
Jacqueline Susann’s chief talent is as
a realist. She begins by looking through
rose-tinted spectacles, but quite early
in the piece the reader is jolted into
a much harsher and crueller world.
Some of the people in this world are
innately corrupt, and success merely
triggers off the basic rottenness inside
them, while others, like Anne and Jen-
nifer, are fundamentally decent, but the
cold, hard logic of this glittering world
whittles away their illusions until little
is left.
“Any God Will Do” is not nearly as
good as Jacqueline Susann’s book. It
starts off more promisingly, because
(Mr. Condon obviously has more liter-
ary expertise, but while warmth and
real experience come through in her
Jacqueline Susann
book, they are completely lacking in
Mr. Condon’s elaborate artifice.
The book begins with the suicide
of the president of a mammoth bank-
ing corporation. The hero (or anti-
hero) of the book, Francis Vollmer r
imagines that he is the son of noble
parents and that when his identity is
revealed he will occupy an illustrious
position in society. To accomplish this
destiny he methodically acquires pro-
digious skill in cooking, love-making,
and French so that he will be able to
live up to his position, and he also
acquires a phenomenal but completely
useless and disorientated general
knowledge. He then dumps his beauti-
ful wife and absconds with bank funds
to Europe in such a way that it is
almost impossible to trace his fraud.
His departure for Europe is also pre-
cipitated by the fact that his wife
reveals that he is the child of dwarfs
and not nobles as he firmly believes.
Vollmer is of course insane and in
Europe he mixes up his fantasies and
reality and races about the Continent
displaying his prodigious prowess in
bed and at the stove. All this becomes
rather boring after a while. Condon is
not really a very accurate observer, a
lot of the satire lacks point, and the
whole thing finally becomes rather a
pretentious jeu d’esprit.
Kafka's Passion
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Mistress to Kafka, Margarete Buber-
Neumann. Seeker & Warburg. $6.1*5.
TWO YEARS BEFORE his death
Franz Kafka wrote in his diary: “What
have you done with the gift of sex?
The answer is that you have failed. But
you might easily have succeeded. M.
was right. Fear is the misfortune.” This
fascinating biography is the story of
Kafka’s “M.” the daughter of a rich
tyrannical Czech plastic surgeon
Milena Jesenska, who, for a short time,
succeeded in becoming Kafka's mistress.
Succeeded seems the only appro-
priate word, for he always remained
revolted by physical love, calling it a
form of “sinister black-magic, a hocus-
pocus, a philosopher’s stone” of which
he had no need. Yet he was obviously
deeply in love with the wild, passionate
24-year-old and found in her a com-
plete intellectual appreciation for his
then virtually unacknowledged literary
genius and a sensitive insight into and
full understanding for his extraordinary
personality. Because Milena was un-

able to accept a platonic meeting of
minds Kafka finally forced himself to
break with her.
Milena liked to reason later that
had she not already been married
(though unhappily) to Ernst Polak,
and had she been free to live with
Franz openly, she might have been able
to drive away “the fear.” This is, of
course, a matter for conjecture, but
Kafka’s own writing seems to render
this conclusion questionable: he loved
his fear, and at the same time hated
it, considering it, in calmer moments,
as the best part of himself, probably
the creative part.
On the other hand, no one recog-
nised this as clearly as Milena, who
predicted his early death, seeing him as
too pure, too good for this imperfect
world, with an insufficient desire for
life, while Kafka appears to have
acknowledged Milena as the personi-
fication of life itself, offering him the
strength to go and seize it. Fully aware
of what he was doing, he turned his
back. Death probably appeared less
frightening than the monstrous “Trial”
of everyday existence, so fraught with
hidden traps and dangers, peopled with
anonymous enemies, and paved with
opening abysses. His heavily loaded
self-question with its deliberately oracu-
lar overtones, “Choice between life and
death? How can you hesitate?” is
symptomatic.
So negative met positive with fore-
seeable results: Kafka succumbed to his
lung complaint in 1924, and Milena
went on to new loves and a new life as
a celebrated Prague journalist, to die
some 20 years later in a Nazi concen-
tration camp which in itself might have
been a figment of Kafka’s imagination.
In the camp she met the third remark-
able personality in this intellectual
triangle, Margarete Buber-Neumann,
the author, a former German Com-
munist who had been handed over to
Hitler by Stalin to seal his friendship
pact. Like many good biographers, Frau
Neumann is “in love” with her subject,
though she delicately hints between the
lines that her deep attachment to Milena
had no lesbian overtones. She learnt her
story in hurried and forbidden conver-
sations, during hours snatched together
at odd places in the prison, and on that
mythical day of release they planned to
write a book together.
Life in Ravensbrueck and the psy-
chology of the camp forms a grim
continuity throughout. Both according
to this biographer (and even more
recently according to a male inmate
of d’Harcourt) the deadliest enemy was
not so much the SS itself as the more
powerful of the fellow-prisoners who
informed on the others, dispensed
favors and rations, and so held the
means of life and death in their hands.

sioned Communists, were especially vul-

good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.
SINCE 1753
The extra mild Amphora in the brown pouch is
the regular blend. The mild aromatic is in the
blue pouch, while the full aromatic Amphora
comes in the red pouch.

nerable. Drawn together by circum-
stances, they crammed an intensity of
friendship into a few short years.
Kafka and Milena’s real association
was even shorter, but as Arthur Koest-
ler points out in his admirably succinct
preface, this portrait of Milena reveals
Kafka himself in a clearer light. Some-
thing essential is added, “his reflection
in Milena’s eye,” which not even his
own “Letters to Milena” or his pub-
lished diaries could supply. Milena’s
letters to Kafka are lost and he had
left instructions to destroy all his un-
published MSS, including “The Trial,”
after his death. (Max Brod has de-
fended the posthumous publications by
explaining that he had told Kafka
bluntly that he had no intention of
burning all his work, and thank heaven
for that!)
The Milena who emerges is surely
one of the most colorful characters
outside fiction the true bohemian in
every sense of the word, rebellious, out-
spoken from early childhood, dramatic,
flamboyant, unconventional in dress,
flouting conformism, at odds with her
cruelly insensitive, anti-Semite father,
spending money including other
people’s—like water, and also generous
herself.
When her husband gave her nothing,
which happened often, she acted as a
casual baggage-porter. She went
through a stage of drug addiction, but
had the strength of mind to effect a
complete cure; she loved too much and
too often, because she had an abundance
to give. She moved through the
mysterious old city of Prague and
among the awakening Czech intelli-
gentsia of the ’twenties, to use Kafka’s
own description, like a “living fire.” She
inspired love or hate and for her there
was nothing in between. Later, as a
famous political journalist, she wrote
anti-Nazi articles in leading newspapers
in occupied Prague which were so
cleverly worded in her native language
that it took quite some time before the
Germans understood what was going on
under their own noses. Though she
possessed that big handicap to great
courage a vivid imagination she
drove herself on to the end. At the time
of her arrest she was running three
resistance papers and smuggling black-
listed patriots and Jews across the
border.
The author believes that Milena and
Kafka first met over some disagreement
in her translations of some of his books
into Czech (although born in Prague,
his parents were German-speaking Jews
and he wrote in his mother tongue).
And however remarkable Milena was
in her own right, her name will mainly
survive through her association with
Kafka, through whom she has touched
immortality. Her obituary for him in
1924 began: “The death occurred the
day before yesterday ... of Dr. Franz
Kafka, a German writer known to few
. . .” and concluded with “All his works
describe the horror of secret misunder-
standings and innocent guilt in human
beings. He was a man and an artist of


such scrupulous conscience that he
remained alert where the others, the
deaf, felt themselves already secure.”
Margarete Buber - Neumann has
tackled her difficult subject with taste,
tact, and truth, always managing to pull
up in time as she reaches the brink of
sentimentality or blatant heroine-
worship. She can create atmosphere in
a few sentences and catch the essence
of a personality in as many words. This
is a fine piece of writing, rendered into
excellent English, which makes it the
more regrettable that the translator is
nowhere acknowledged by name.
The Thistle Muse
By NORMAN TALBOT
The Company I’ve Kept. Hugh Mc-
Diarmid. Calder and Boyars. $4.45.
WHEN HUGH McDIARMID moves
into autobiography the world should
sit up and take notice. After all, he is
known as one of the great poets of the
century, one of the best Scottish poets
ever (a peer of Burns and Dunbar). He
stood as a Communist in Sir Alec
Douglas-Home’s blue-ribbon Tory seat
in the last elections. He is a Border
warrior whose Nationalist fervor and
anglophobia are legendary. He has been
a Social Creditist since the ’thirties. In
fact, he’s the sort of committed poet
who should be able to show us the tur-
moils and decisions of a unique person-
ality in a time of transition.
But he’s even more extraordinary
than he sounds, and contains so many
contradictions that the world he lives
in remains mostly unclarified. As a
Communist, he rejoined the Party after
Hungary, when so many left it. As a
Social Creditist, he despises the moral
and religious developments of his allies.
As a Nationalist poet he considers his
country’s culture appallingly provincial
and meanminded. Once you’ve worked
out these problems, two deeper contra-
dictions remain, raising issues crucial to
our understanding of this century and
“Western” civilisation.
McDiarmid the Communist and
Nationalist relies for his faith and his
arguments on the quality of the people
oppressed by the capitalistic Anglo-
Saxons, yet the poet, admiring Sorabji
(a composer who will not allow his
enormous works to be performed),
quotes and writes tirades against the
doltishness of all audiences, the natural
hatred that both mediocrity and talent
have for genius. He goes further than
praising stubborn genius that defies its
audience’s standards; he becomes a com-
plete hero-worshipper in both art and
politics. In poems like “The Skeleton of
the Future (at Lenin’s Tomb)” he can
make sense of this, but not in this book.
McDiarmid is a revered, confident,
egotistical writer, yet he spends about
half his time quoting. Certainly, he
designs the book around the friends who
have seemed important to him, but to
quote at page length or more all the
time, from those friends, from anyone
else who comes to hand, and a great
deal from his own earlier verse and
prose, seems self-defeating. The last
paragraph is quoted (of course) from
Norman Lindsay, and claims that
people are imbeciles, and no wise man
bothers to find common ground with
others.
He endeavors to find himself at no
matter what cost, and to be true to
that self when found, a worthy
occupation for a lifetime.
McDiarmid knows very little of him-
self, though his blurb claims that this
sentence is “marvellously apposite” to
him. His book is not a self-discovery but
a grab-bag of arguments, admirations,
prejudices, mutterings, and diatribes.
It seems odd that McDiarmid knows
very little about the personal lives of
the friends that the book is about but
this is more than the impersonality of
the man. He is writing about public
and important men, and believes that
external actions are more important
than private lives. This is a sensible
attitude, and if the book resembles any-
thing it is the night-long Scots argument
(or sometimes monologue) called “a
guid crack,” where intelligent conver-
sation is preferred to gossip.
Impersonality is a device as well as
a tendency. For example, Ezra Pound
is made the excuse for McDiarmid to
discuss expic-scale poetry, the per-
nicious effect of Christianity on art, the
nature of modern Capitalist “Usury,”
and so on. What ruins the book is
that this doesn’t work. The discussion
dies in a welter of quotations from D.
G. James, Denis Saurat, Edwin Mor-
gan, Gilbert Cannan, McDiarmid, and
others, with plenty more names and
references thrown in. The chapter ends
inexplicably with a long quotation from
a reviewer hostile to McDiarmid. The
issues are interesting and McDiarmid is
the man to discuss them (especially
the hyprocrisy about money and sex he
says “underlies every facet of English
life”), but he doesn’t do it.
Apart from anything in what it says,
it is a diagnosis of McDiarmid’s world,
which is an important one. The contra-
diction between brotherhood of man,
contempt for man, and hero-worship,
and that between egoism and imperson-
ality, are symptomatic of the great
gap between artist and audience.
Though he uses quotations when he’s
out of his depth, like lifebelts, and has
lived in a “strong solution of books”
all his life, though he even plagiarises
heavily in his later poetry, yet
McDiarmid isn’t dishonest or cowardly
he seems the reverse. In the Mod-
ernist writers (and other artists) there
developed the conviction that the old
world and its art forms were played out
and had to be replaced. A modernist
might reject Wordsworth, the Queen,
Liberalism, Francis Bacon, and so on,
because that Culture was moribund,
but when a man, a cultural fact, or an
ideology was not easy to reject like this,
it became a small island of depend-
ability in a vast sea of flux. If Pound
revered Mussolini, Wyndham Lewis
revered Hitler, Eliot revered Dante,
and so on, McDiarmid reveres Lenin.
Eliot’s “Waste Land” is full of frag-
ments shored against his ruins, Chinese
ideograms freckle the pages of the
Cantos, in the same way as “The
Company I’ve Kept” tries to rely for
its nutrition on quotations from its
heroes. It is mainly because there is
no immediate relationship of writer and
audience that no efficient digestive
system develops for this foreign matter.
The book is interesting (especially
in a country where it may seem inex-
plicable that an intelligent man should
revere Lenin), but no one could com-
pare it with the best of McDiarmid’s
poetry. The brief lyrics, “A Drunk
Looks At The Thistle” and “First
Hymn to Lenin,” are heroic where this
prose is belligerent, subtle rather than
evasive, moving rather than sentimental,
intellectual rather than argumentative-
Landlady
She told us she was going blind; the plastic roses
In her cluttered lounge wanly attested the fact.
A Persian tom-cat (doctored) ruled the house,
Owning soft cushions and the scarcely resisted right
To brush the simpering china cherubs from their shelves.
We trod cat-soft, reluctantly taken boarders
A typical whim, or really needing the motley?
And watched her fussiness bloom, her yearning
For culture expressing itself in C.A.E. groups
And the hanging of gilt-framed Gainsborough prints;
While her concern for us gradually tangled
The thorn-free path she had chosen towards death.

A.P.M. Research looks
at a small world
Fibres in paper, micro-organisms in soil, the cellular structure of trees.
This is the world of the incredibly small that A.P.M. scientists are
investigating every day.
In the 1920’s Australian scientists set out to find a method of making
paper from Australian eucalypts. These methods are the basis of our
industry today and the pulping of hardwoods is now well established
in all paper-making countries.
The research being done today in A.P.M. laboratories will pay off in
better products, and greater industrial growth tomorrow.
A.P.M. is the leading paper maker in the southern hemisphere. It is
an Australian company owned by over 35,000 Australian investors, em-
ploying over 5,800 people in eight mills throughout the country.
A.P.M. is a forward thinking company which regards scientific research
as the basis of future progress.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Sterling Exit
WE could perhaps have been a little bit more tactful
when six months ago we questioned the Government’s
policy of keeping the overwhelming proportion of its
foreign exchange in sterling. Our timing was rather impolite.
Sterling was in trouble, and any withdrawal on our part
might just have been the straw which broke the Bank of
England’s back. But the situation is completely transformed
now. Mr. Wilson’s austerity measures have been successful
beyond the most optimistic expectations, Britain’s balance
of trade has swung into quite uncharacteristic surplus, and
it has just been announced that all Britain’s short-term debts
have been paid off. The boat has grown steady and stable
now. We need not fear about rocking it.
The Sterling Area no longer exists except through the
unilateral adherence of countries like Australia. Free con-
vertibility was the advantage we bought with our pledge to
keep our reserves in London. That was whittled away in
Britain’s Budget of 21 months ago, and withdrawn in last
year’s regulations. We now see the effects in the rapid
decline in capital inflow into this country and the rundown
in our reserves at a time when the trade balance is in healthy
surplus. When we wrote last there was one positive advantage
in holding reserves in London. Interest rates were extra-
ordinarily high. Now they are down, and will probably go
lower.
It is worth pointing out that there are some simple prin-
ciples which should govern the geographical disposition of
our reserves. First, they should be distributed roughly in
proportion to our trade so that transactions are simplified.
This would mean a switch from sterling into yen and
dollars. The second principle to be followed is that our
reserves should earn interest. It would be irresponsible for
the authorities to have funds flowing madly back and forth
chasing the highest rates of return. There is no case for a
governmental hot-money policy. This does not preclude
adjustments to our reserves disposition based on an 18
months or two years perspective.
Another consideration is important. Britain’s short-term
problems may be solved, but the Labor Government’s bold
1964 plans for modernising the country are only now begin-
ning to be implemented and now only faint-heartedly. A
recurrence of the payment crisis would quite likely be met
by devaluation; in that we would suffer heavily if we stuck
by our present policies. Many English observers also predict
devaluation in another possible circumstance in the case
of Britain failing to enter the Common Market.
It’s high time we got the hell out of old sterling.
The Easy Option

poration, whose new issue department he heads,
Harper treated the Australian British Trade Association con-

MEN AND MATTERS
BRITISH Tobacco has its well-
publicised soft spots —but soft
drink is not one of them. Probably
the most successful of its diversifications
out of the cigarette business has been
into Shelley’s Drinks Pty. Ltd., a move
quite against all the rules of how to do
this sort of thing. In the first place, it
paid a fortune for the company when
the price of the shares was already his-
torically high; secondly, it bought into
an industry that appeared highly com-
petitive; and, thirdly, it not only-
acquired a family company but also left
the family firmly in control.
Four Shelley brothers and a brother-
in-law are executive directors on the
board, with two representatives of
British Tobacco, which owns 73 percent
of the capital. Since the Shelley family-
sold their shares to British Tobacco
three years ago profits have increased
140 percent.
Grandfather “Jam” Shelley started
the soft-drink business in thirsty Broken
Hill in the ’eighties, and it was his
eldest son, Matthew, father of the
present managers, who started up in
Marrickville in 1929. The four brothers
now in charge, known affectionately to
employees as Uncles John, Bert, Bernie,
and Fred, don’t ever remember a row
in the family, even though it embraces
cousins galore in Broken Hill, Adelaide,
and Melbourne. Their sons are now
learning the business—one is marketing
manager, two are “witch-doctoring” in
the syrup room, a son-in-law is the
accountant.
This genius for harmony and happy
co - existence al-
lows Shelley’s to
compete in N.S.W.
with the house-to-
house peonle and
the national
and international
giants. At the
same time, Shel-
ley’s holds the
Cottees franchise
i n Wollongong
and the Schwep-
pes franchise in
Broken Hill. (The
soft-drink trade is more complicated
than it looks. British Tobacco’s other
subsidiary, APD, sells Coca-Cola in
Perth and Melbourne, Marchants in
Melbourne, and its Helidon Gardner
subsidiary sells Kirks and Cottees in
Brisbane.)
The Shelley brothers all live in close
proximity to one another in southern
Sydney suburbs and enjoy boating
together.

journey got a bit bogged down in the
more inclement economic weather last
year, but this hasn’t deterred Hino from
wanting a further cementing of its
tie-up. Its distinguished president, 59-
year-old Masanobu Matsukata, the
grandson of a Japanese Prime Minister
in the Meiji era, has just spent a fort-
night here making the arrangements.
Doyen of the Japanese motor indus-
try, Mr. Matsukata also took in talks
with other industry representatives,
Government and consular officials dur-
ing his stay, doubtless with the idea of
giving a push to Japanese sales in
general here. An economics graduate of
Keio University, he has been with
Hino, a hive-off from Tokyo Electric,
of which his father was president, since
taking his degree in 1932, reaching the
chair in 1960. He became director of
the Japan Motor Federation in 1962,
and has held the same office in most of
the country’s national automotive
bodies.


of frankness ,; et about the finance of foreign firms here. We
hadn’t possibly realised, though the suspicion was there, the
full extent to which overseas subsidiaries relied for expan-
sion on the provision of funds within Australia and so little
on the genuine importation of capital. Also, apparently, it is
usually only when an overseas subsidiary has exhausted the
possibilities of bleeding our local banks and institutions that
the question of selling some of the equity to Australians is
really taken seriously.
Assuming, say, that original capital emanates from over-
seas (there are some shining examples of companies, such
as GM-H, where precious little of it has), the first source
of funds to be tackled here would be the banks. At least in
the case of British-owned firms, Mr. Harper inclines to think
they are a pushover (“Some banks have stronger London
connections than others, and the power of a word dropped
while strolling back from a city club should not be over-
looked”). Banking practice here is so accommodating. Once
established, an overdraft becomes almost a permanent part
of a company’s capital structure. And bank managers are
so compliant “in an economy where bank money is rela-
tively cheap and where pressure as applied by the banks
to seek even fluctuations, let alone permanent reduction, in
the level of an individual company’s overdraft, is best des-
cribed as gentlemanly,” he stated. As for getting money on
commercial bills, “These bills as they are used in Australia
are, in the main, but not entirely, an extension of the over-
draft facilities banks can offer.” This money can be turned
round and round pretty conveniently also.
Getting money from institutions can be much more diffi-
cult say a private placement of a long or medium term
security. In fact, unless a prospectus is filed you will be
scratching. Then follows a familiar rigmarole to open the
hearts of the life companies and the pension funds managers.
It runs from giving a morgage on a building or, better still,
offering a floating charge, and ends at the Reserve Bank,
making a case that “the company’s contribution to exports or
employment or some such politically good objective is vital.”
But companies can’t expect the market to move in a
hurry. The machinery works painfully slowly compared with
the London capital market; Harper should know 7 , because he’s
worked both there and here in the business. “In London the
handling of the mechanical side of issues is a wmnder to be-
hold,” he said.
If, he went on, a company has used funds from the
banks and institutions pretty fully, two of its toes being in the
water so to speak, and finds itself short, “trouble really sets in,
for there is almost nothing left to do but sell some equity.”
BHP's Export Whirligig
IT is perhaps a little ironic that many investors will turn
first to those pages of BHP’s fine supplementary report
which deal wfith the group’s oil and gas activities (under
the conventional and unexcited head of Raw 7 Materials and
Exploration). At least equal immediate economic interest
attaches to Sir Colin Syme’s summary of the more traditional
operations.
The company is plainly straining against its existing steel
and pig iron capacity to supply what it expectantly describes
as a “continuation of the upward trend in local orders.
Looking slightly ahead to larger demand from resurgent
primary industry in particular, it sounds rather disarming to
call this a “return to more normal levels of consumption.”
What that may really indicate is a probable lessening of
BHP’s steel exports. Erratic as these are from period to
period, depending as they do on the oscillation of domestic
demand, such exports are a valuable aid to Australia’s balance
of payments.
Sir Colin, of course, is forced to observe that export prices,
although improving in certain areas, “are likely to remain
generally unattractive.” So his company has to have no
financial inhibition in yielding to local requirements. It
would be nationally desirable that a reasonable export level
coud be held, and competed for, at all times.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy ; In a fairly quiet statistical
week rain meant the best news, for there seemed agree-
ment at last that the drought had been completely broken
. . . February’s exports, at $264m, looked just as cheer-
ing in achieving their best level since April 1951; with
$234.1 m of imports, a $29.9m favorable trade balance
was thrown down, against January’s $19.1m deficit.
The eight months to February leave a $30.7m visible
deficit.
The December quarter’s gross national product ad-
vanced by about 5.5 percent in real terms.
For the markets: Hesitancy reigns over the
Australian share markets, which have fluttered down a
little further. Clear-cut decision, however, struck copper
miners and a few companies with poor interims.
Bursts of energy among industrials in London seemed
chiefly inspired by hopes of lower interest rates . . .
Wall Street became extremely busy as well, although
many individual gains were reduced by chilly thoughts
on the economy.
For companies: The ripely comprehensive
“supplementary report” from BHP is naturally required
reading in toto. After mentioning many “near capacity
levels of output,” directors add: “A continuation of
the upward trend in local orders in 1967 is expected.”
Rejoicing in its 150th anniversary, the Bank of New
South Wales gives “proprietors” a bonus present at 8
cents a $2 share, taking $2,107,200 (the share market
apparently expected more). The president’s special re-
port carriers generosity further by remarking on “a
favorable trend in profit.”
Excitement has not been entirely lacking elsewhere
. . . British textiler Viyella International is offering 40
cents a 50 cent ordinary for the 81.7 percent of Davies
Coop capital it doesn’t own, keeping the bid open four
months. In quick rejection, Davies Coop’s directors
brand the offer as “unrealistic” . . . Board unanimity
launches a proposed merger between Sydney retailers
Buckinghams and F. J. Palmer in a new holding com-
pany which could control 31 stores in N.S.W. . . .
Board disagreement is leading British Tobacco to
acquire the outside half of Sou’West Frozen Food
Packers Ltd.; the tobacco group plans careful review
of some problem food diversifications.
Controversial Ansett Transport Industries produced
a 13.7 percent profit advance (from $1,929,829 to
$2,194,128) for the December half-year and drew
attention to “a significant increase in revenue” of the
television subsidiary.
Tax allowances aided diverse Boral in bringing the
December period’s profit up by 34.4 percent to
$2,311,065 and comfortably to hold the 10 percent in-
terum; anticipations for the second half suggest easy
recovery of 1965-66’s decline . . . Boral’s 56 percent
owned Petrochemical Holdings fell back $65,090 to
$219,246 over the December half . . . Expansion is the
word for ACF and Shirleys Fertilisers, to build plants
costing $7.5m. at Gladstone and Townsville; portion
of the finance is to come from shareholders.
Considerably more optimistic about the pastoral opera-
tions (which come to account in the second half), L. J.
Hooker Investment Corporation bettered all other
activities to December and sees the improvement con-
tinuing . . . More wholly rural, Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort went “somewhat higher” for the half-
year, revenue gains countering cost increases.
Civil engineering looked up through Thiess Holdings,
where substantial profit increases allow dividend to come
on to a 10 percent annual rate; the contract position is
buoyant . . . Heavy engineer Tulloch will probably lose
again in 1966-67 on indications up to March.
Paper group Reed Consolidated earned at a 35 per-
cent annual rate (previously 24.8 percent) to the new
December balance period . . . Fire protection engineer
Wormald Brothers must pass its interim.

A Jump for Joy in Trade
By CROESUS
TAKING note of our slimming over-
seas reserves kitty and the glowing-
prospectus being drawn for the
domestic economy with its implications
of a rising imports bill, we should all
jump for joy at February’s highly satis-
factory overseas commodity trading.
The month’s visible surplus of $29.9
million was the best since May last year
and compared with a deficit of $l.l
million in the same month last year. It
reduced the cumulative eight months’
visible trade deficit to $30.6 million, a
striking contrast to the $225.6 million
deficit for the same period last year.
These figures are strongly in the right
pattern for the balance of payments,
but, unfortunately, in face of a markedly
reduced rate of net capital inflow they
are not strong enough to have pre-
vented a loss of roughly $l6O million in
overseas reserves in the eight months
to the end of February. In fact, despite
the good trade out-turn last month,
overseas reserves fell $22 million, bring-
ing them down equivalent to less than
five months’ supply of imports at the
average rate of importing over the past
three months. Nor is that rate of im-
porting ($246 million a month) high by
the standard of some months this year.
For instance, in January itself (one of
those months) the imports bill was $284
million; last August it was $291 million,
and in September, when $34.1 million
for the HMAS Hobart was included,
$286.4 million.
Happily, but for reserves not happily
enough, imports came back to $234.1
million in February, some of the drop
being accounted for by the lower num-
ber of working days on the wharves in
that month. On a daily rate basis, the
fall from January is not so striking as
the way, despite the lower number of
working days, exports were pushed up
to $264 million, within coo-ee of the
highest monthly figure ever, established
in April, 1951, during the Korean com-
modity boom.
February’s were only $3.4 million
higher than January’s exports of $260.4
million. In appraising the performance
of these two months, allowance must be
made for seasonal flushness. Unfor-
tunately there are no official details of
trading items to hand for either month,
the latest being for December, which
were only released last week, two
months after the end of the month.
They used to be much more up to
date; now they are apparently held up
to get out all the helpful classifica-
tions. The question arises whether in
the interests of up-to-dateness these
classifications might be issued later and
the bare trade details earlier. Any-
way, apparently bumper wheat and
steel exports had a lot to do with the
good performance. So did minerals,
notably iron ore, which should continue
to figure prominently in the returns,
even if high steel exports may not, as
the revival in home demand for steel
proceeds further.
With such excellent export and lowish
import figures in front of us, perhaps
this is not quite the ti,me to cry wolf on
the balance-of-payments front. But
there’s no harm in thinking about the
possibilities should exports start sliding
from their present heights, say, at a time
when imports were moving in more
vigorously in response to resurgent
domestic demand here. One can envis-
age a situation where wool and metals,
albeit on higher volume of exports,
were bringing in less because of lower
overseas prices and, concurrently, a
faster rate of economic development
and industrial output generally could
be demanding substantially higher im-
ports of capital goods and producers’
materials. One can exclude for the
moment the likelihood of overseas de-
fence purchases taking a bigger toll of
overseas reserves and also the proba-
bility of a rise in imports of finished
goods resulting from more buoyant per-
sonal spending. I’ll consider the latter
two later on.
one sees it at the moment, fixed in-
vestment is still in the doldrums, but
given a sustained lift in personal con-
sumption, it could pick up fairly
rapidly, especially in manfacturing. In
that case, being imposed on present
high demands for capital goods by the
mining industry and governments (in-
cluding overseas defence purchases),
the imports bill would rise significantly.
Allowing for a degree of supporting
capital inflow to a revival of private
fixed investment, overseas reserves
would have to take most of the strain.
Items of capital equipment, including
transport, provided 29.1 percent of total
imports in the twelve months to June
30 last, pushing up not only to their
biggest share ever of the imports bill
but also to their highest money value.
However, since February last year, their
share of imports and their average
monthly value have dropped signifi-
cantly, reflecting the malaise in fixed
private investment. Of the total drop
of $42 million in imports in the
six months to December, compared with
the like period 1965-66, $25m., or well
over half, was accounted for by a drop
in capital-equipment imports from
$432m. to $407m., reducing their per-
centage of total imports to 28.4. The
most laggard item was equipment for
farms, so with investment hormones in
that direction now in the process of
being revitalised after the drought and
with a revival of fixed investment in
industry and transport certainly on the
cards, the imports bill for capital equip-
ment could well be much higher from
now on.
What about imports outside the capi-
tal goods range? To start with, an
upsurge in personal spending would
entail an increase in the imports of

many raw materials and components
required for producing consumer goods
(including durables and cars) and not
obtainable or in short supply here.
Since rising imports of such things
boosted the imports bill uncomfortably
in the 1960 boom, imports replacement
has gone a long way in filling the supply
channels of such items. But the list is
still long; from many components and
parts of motor vehicles to tobacco, rub-
ber, and petroleum, the number of con-
sumers is so much bigger, making the
potential imports demand for them the
higher. This is the imports area where
we are most likely to see the biggest
increases in the event of the current rise
in personal consumption proceeding fur-
ther. They seem bound to occur what-
ever happens to fixed private invest-
ment.
Such materials constitute by far the
biggest segment of imports, although
their percentage of the total bill has
been coming down in recent years. It
was as high as 53.5 percent in the boom
year 1960-61 and 51.2 percent in 1964-
65; last year, 1965-66, it fell to only
46.9 percent, a figure bearing the mark
of a subdued year. In the six months
to December last it was down to 45.2
percent, or in value terms compared
with the like period 1965-66 from
s7lBm. to $662m. Needless to say, this
area of imports has a high potential
(the highest of all areas, I should think)
for adding to the total bill in the event
of a strong internal revival in activity.
'J’HERE’S food for thought in all this,
and it takes on an even sharper
flavor if we now bring defence and
finished goods briefly to the table, as
we must to get the full picture. Defence
imports crept up from a tiny decimal of
the total bill in 1963-64, then jumped
to 1.6 percent the next year, and in
1965-66 to 2.8 percent. In the six
months to December, 1966, the bill of
$72 million for these was 3J times
bigger than for the same six months of
the previous year and represented 5.1
percent of the total. Enough said.
As for finished goods the last
and upper, as it were, layer of imports
which most countries try hard to keep
cut to the bone, but usually find they
can’t in the light of spending sprees
to come it is significant that, compared
with the like period 1965-66, they, of all
the big groups of imports, increased
their value in the latest December half-
year, and, pro tanto, their percentage
of total imports also increased to 17.4
percent from 16.4 percent last year. In
the five months from last July they’ve
averaged about $45 million a month, or
s6m. more a month than in 1965-66,
and as much as $l3 million more a
month than in the boom year 1960-61.
So much for the net effect of import re-
placement on import requirements for
fjpished goods of a rapidly growing
pppulation. Looking ahead to another
ppssible boom, it is well worth remem-
ppring that in the boom year 1960-61
jfnports of finished goods leapt by close
on 20 percent.

Not So Bad for Softwood
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
INVESTORS with an eye to the
future should be pleased, indeed,
that the market is very sad about
the halved profit from Softwood Hold-
ings Ltd. This could be one occasion
on which the situation looks worse
than it really is. There is a real prospect
of recovery—and the Federal Govern-
ment last week was full of enthusiasm
about the economics of growing soft-
wood in Australia and how it should
be encouraged. Nevertheless, there was
a touch of bad luck in the timing of
a strong recommendation from one
Sydney broker to buy Softwood Hold-
mgs shares that he sent to clients only
a few days before the dreadful interim
report came out. ... ,
The broker suggested clients buy at
$2.45, lust before the market lopped
the shares to $2.20. He had predicted
a slightly lower declared profit for the
December half-year, due to the stub-
born recession in the S.A. building
industry. But as several new ventures
begin their contribution to profits in
the current year, he expected that
declared profit for the full year would
approximate last year’s $843,000 and
33.3 percent earning rate,
As it happened, the company
announced slightly higher sales, but
profit reduced from $446,000 to
$255,000, due to increased costs and
difficult marketing condition. Profits,
which had been virtually tax-free in the
past because of calls paid on afforesta-
tion subsidiaries and tax losses acquired
f rom Kauri Timber, attracted $70,000
tax in the latest half year. This was
mor e than for any full year since 1960.
The ticle board plant insta i led in
the first half is in pro duction and per-
forming “according to expectations.” So

are for S reat lncreases m th,s
Th e broker was probably right about
the long-term prospects of Softwood,
despite his short-term mistake. Fore-
casting a critical shortage of timber in
the years ahead, he estimated that Aus-
tralia’s likely supply of timber in the
year 2000 may meet only 63 percent
of our requirements, maybe as little as
40 percent.
Softwood Holdings, as a grower of
radiata pine and a manufacturer, is in
a category different from others in the
timber industry and deserved more
investment attention, he argued. The
lengthy dissertation on the qualities of
radiata pine (it will produce 30 times
more useful wood per acre than
eucalypts and has six times the eucalypts
growth rate), and its high investment
return, make an impressive story, but
for the long run. The 4.6 percent
income return is very modest and the
1966-67 earnings could cut the earn-
ings yield to 8 or 9 percent. If the
shares get below the $2 level they could
be appealing.
RECOVERY” is not such a dirty
word after all. There are still
plenty of companies in the
recovery class that the market has not
really given due credit to: Boral, Thiess,
BMI, and Email interim profits should
have whetted the appetites of market
players for this kind of stock that has
been so out of favor in recent times.
Even Davies Coop now seems to have
flown from the depressed areas. But if
the interim report is anything to go by,
BMI should be in for even better times
in the future, even though it has been
a most unimpressive performer in recent
times—and even though the most attrac-
tive thing about it is its half interest in
Ready Mixed Concrete.
But there is probably even greater
significance in the BMI result for
Pioneer Concrete, whose share prices
have been unnaturally depressed by its
takeover activity. There are a lot of
Pioneer shares around following its
curious F. W. Williams deal.
NO matter how expensive Mauri
Bros, may still look, the present
retreat in its share price as the
market eases back could provide good
opportunities for buying a stock that
has some special appeal right now.
Mauri got as high as $2.27 last month
and is now creeping back above

the $2.15 mark. But the destruction of
the Cascade Brewery in the Tasmanian
fires has added another potential cus-
tomer for Mauri’s large brewery supply
business. The company no doubt
already has its eyes on the Courage
group’s Melbourne plans and will be a
contender for the contracts to supply
a great deal of the equipment there as
well as in the rebuilt Cascade brewery.
This should more than offset the dull
appearance that was settling over this
section of its business as a slackening
rate of Australian beer consumption
was slowing down the rate of develop-
ment in this industry.
On the other hand, Mauri Bros, have
a large New Zealand operation cover-
ing the same widely diversified field as
in Australia and this operation could
well be affected by the economic climate
there.
The Chartist says:
THE downtrend of many years’ duration followed by OIL SEARCH LTD. now
shows promising signs of reversal. It can be seen from the chart reproduced
back to 1960 that this stock is capable of very steep intermediate trends.
Volume has been particularly heavy since the steep decline which took prices to
a low point of 8 cents in December, 1966. The stock could be safely bought once
the 20 cents resistance level is broken on high turnover and the overall base
consolidation suggests a target for the longer term of about 48 cents. Last sale price
on 10/3/’67 —16 cents.
Nylex to Grow
By PELIAS in Melbourne
AT the risk of losing money when
Nylex Corporation announces its
final dividend for 1966 at the end
of this month, one can’t help but see
growth in the shares at their current
1967 low of 71 cents. Their high point
for more than a year was 88 cents,
touched on the last day of 1966 trading.
Ironically, the name change from
Moulded Products, effective from Janu-
ary 1, coincided with a steady drift in
the shares down to their present price.
This was despite the record annual pro-
fit announced in mid-February. Admit-
tedly, it returned only 12.8 percent on
capital hardly a respectable sort of
cover for another 10 percent dividend.
The interim in the year to Decmber 31
was a steady five percent and share-
holders are obviously having doubts over
whether the final will be the same.
However, if 10 percent could be dis-
tributed in 1965, when earning rate was
only 12.2 percent, there is no reason
why that should not be the payout
again. In point of fact, the outlook for
the company is currently much better
than it was a year ago, despite the in-
creased capital which it must service
from 1967, right through until 1971,
following the issue to ICIANZ.
The outlook appears to promise

growth in the long term, with a hand
some dividend yield of seven percen
on current market prices in the mean
time. The company should find a biggei
and more profitable market for its'
P.V.C. products as a result of the agree:
ment recently negotiated between the
Australian and the Japanese Govern-
ments. ICIANZ left the field to Nylex'
last year in a move to rationalise
industry and counter the crippling com>
petition from imports. Fortunately for,
Nylex, Japan has now agreed to drasti-.
cally limit its coated P.V.C. exports to
Australia in exchange for a removal of
temporary duties previously imposed on
its imports to this country.
One only has to glance at the chair-
man’s past complaints over import com-
petition to realise the significance of
this. He has said that the group needs
protection from the imports which have
provided such severe body blows to
turnover and profit. Mr. Fitzpatrick
has often pointed specifically to the
difficulties caused by heavy imports of
Japanese vinyl products. Local manu-*
facturers have really had to struggle
to get a decent share of the market and
they have been prodded in the back
more and more by rising costs. The
latest agreement should go a long way
toward loosening the vice which has
been squeezing Nylex tighter every
year.
'J'HIS is not the only favorable pointer
to the future. One could hardly
deny that the 20 percent share interest
currently held by ICIANZ will do more
good for the group than harm in the
long run. The deal which brought about
this holding left Nylex in a strong posi-
tion, even without the current help
from the Japanese. It removed its most
dangerous competitor in vinyl-coated
fabrics and plasticised vinyl sheet and I
film. Apart from getting an open go
at the market, the acquisition of the
ICIANZ operation will give output
greater overall efficiency and a more
effective use of the knowledge and ex-
perience of the two companies.
The current 12 months should also
see first benefits from a number of
new products which the group has
been working on. These include an
exceptionally strong vinyl sheet, electri-
cal cables, blow-moulded crates, and
continuous print flooring. In the floor-
ing market the company should do
much better now that it has smoothed
out operations on the new production
line.
All in all, it is hard to conceive that
the company will go downhill. For
shareholders, the vital thing at the
moment is the final dividend; there
seems only one reason why it should be
reduced, and that is the perhaps over-
bearing presence of ICIANZ in the
company. However, ICIANZ itself is
a notorious payer of narrowly covered
dividends, so it should not object to
Nylex following suit, especially as the
latter’s outlook is rather bright. These
are the surface facts at least. The
shares should prove good buying at
current prices if the final dividend is

maintained. It is only the doubts over
this which are holding the shares down
at present. The stock is a market
leader and cannot yield seven percent
forever.
ANOTHER high-yielding front rank
stock is Cyclone. At $1.48, the
yield from dividends is 6.8 per-
cent. Market price is only a few cents
above the level ruling before the interim
report was released. This reflects the
apathy in the market at this time of the
year; apart from revealing some vastly
improved figures, the report confirmed
that the group is now in a recovery
trend which should last for at least two
years. One broker in Melbourne has
suggested that the market price will
reach $2 within this period, so there are
capital gains to be made.
In 1965-66 profit fell from $1,600,000
to $1,000,000. This returned 13.1 per-
cent on capital, a much narrowed cover
for the 10 percent dividend. There were
two reasons for the setback. First, the
drought (about 40 percent of the com-
pany’s revenue comes from rural areas),
and, second, losses in the steel-making
and scrap metal subsidiaries. Therein
lie the reasons for the recovery expected
this year and in 1967-68. Rural areas
should be boosting revenue in the cur-
rent year, the scrap metal interests have
been sold, and the steel-making business
has been closed down. Both made losses
in 1965-66.
There are factors apart from these
which make the shares worth buying.
The steel-making subsidiary, which has
proved a drain on group profits almost
from the day it was acquired in 1960,
will soon be completely off the board’s
mind. For the first time in seven years
the directors will be able to devote all
their efforts to the profitable lines of
business, and this must have some effect
on turnovers. More important, how-
ever, will be the extra cash generated
by the sale of the plant and stocks.
Proceeds from stock sales and the
disposal of scrap metal interests have
lifted liquidity substantially and given
the group much .more room to move.
As well as releasing money tied up in
stocks and working capital of these
activities, the sales have enabled the
company to redeem $618,000 in un-
secured notes on the market. There will
probably be further redemptions.
After seven years the company is
finally removing the parasites from its
back. This will give it every chance of
returning to pre-1961 days; share-
holders then were used to seeing
steadily increasing profits as well as
regular cash and bonus issues. Market
prices for the shares in 1961 ranged
between $2.20 and $2.80. Current prices
may provide investors looking to the
medium or long term with the
cheapest entry price they are likely to
see in a long time.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
More Escalation at
Elec. Equipment
NO matter which way the economic
winds blow, Electrical Equip-
ment of Australia Ltd. always
seems to have comforting news for
shareholders. Despite warnings last
October of a difficult year ahead (owing
to higher raw materials costs, particu-
larly copper, and higher wages), direc-
tors have now reported that profits were
only slightly below those for the half-
year to Demember, 1965.
They were sufficiently confident of
the final result to announce a dividend
increase to an annual rate of 17 per-
cent, so maintaining the tradition of
dividend progression since the 10 per-
cent of 1960 and anyway the 1965-
66 earning rate gave more than double
cover for the 16 percent paid that
year.
Catering to the public as well as
private sectors gives the company some
immunity from economic ups and
downs that affect industry. After steady
development, the company is still
modest in size. There are no signs that
it has reached maturity, nor that it will
suffer the growing pains of inadequate
space or finance. The doubling of
N.S.W. electricity consumption every
six or seven years (10 percent a year,
compound) shows the scope for Electri-
cal Equipment’s growth. The PMG has
been expanding rapidly, too. The
company says its growth has been in
all fields, from hot-water services to
electrical distribution; it sees its future
development in the growth of the
nation itself. (Yet it admits that the
demand for electric motors for con-
sumer durable may fall off now.)
r fHE chairman (Mr. G. B. Kater)
said in 1961 that “in the past 10
years we have appropriated for divi-
dends roughly 50 percent of profits after
tax. Our policy has been so to arrange
it that any alteration in dividends has
increased the amount distributed.” And
so it has been, although capital to be
serviced has increased by the one-for-
nine par issue of June, 1964, to s2m.
Meanwhile, substantial sums have been
transferred to general reserves each year,
totalling $1,659,000 since and including
1960.
The business began as Acelec Pty.
Ltd. in 1937, and this original section
is now called Australian Line Materials.
It also incorporates F. L. Kirkby, taken
over in 1958 for $BB,OOO cash. Estab-
lished at St. Leonards (N.S.W.), it sells
to State and municipal departments,
and to heavy industry, switchgear, con-
nectors, pole-line hardware, etc. Perhaps
the most important manufacturing sec-
tion is GMF Electric Motors Pty. Ltd.,
of Arncliffe, which was taken over in
1956. Other firms were taken over in

the ’fifties—Swiftsure Pty. (1954) with
its hot water systems and Transmission
Products Pty. (1955), of North Sydney,
which makes telephone equipment for
'the PMG, amplifiers, etc. Australian
Time Recording Co. Pty. Ltd. was the
last addition to the group in 1961. The
parent company imports and merchan-
dises meters, micro-switches, etc.
Although some of the businesses ac-
quired were paid for partly in shares
to the vendors, there was usually a cash
element, if not total consideration in
cash. This was managed from liquid
funds or existing shareholders were
asked to subscribe to new issues on
generous terms. Apart from the 1964'
issue previously mentioned, going back
to 1957 there was a two-for-five par
issue in April, 1957, a one-for-four par
in September, 1958, and in December,
1959, a two-for-five bonus which cut
the 1 2j percent dividend of two years
standing back to 10 percent. Then there
was a one-for-four par issue in Septem-
ber, 1960.
The company has always enjoyed a
high level of liquidity, and even today
has no fixed term liabilities. The busi-
ness is now well spread throughout the
field of electrical equipment. Although
in the past couple of years it has had
no new products on its inventory, some
have been redesigned or are more
sophisticated.
T'HE very small provision for bad debts
($5500) on trade debtors of $1.7
million is an indication of the repute of
the customers, who, are, in the .main,
government or semi-government depart-
ments and major commercial firms.
The company is proud of its collections;
only in the hot-water service depart-
ment, selling to hardware stores and
builders, are there any bad debts to
speak of. The 70 percent growth in
trade debtors since the $1 million mark
in 1962 is not necessarily a true reflec-
tion of turnover (never revealed) as,
particularly in the past couple of years,
the old morality of 30-day terms has
gone and 60 days payment is now com-
mon for commercial firms. (The 11
percent reduction in Electrical Equip-
ment’s own creditors in 1965-66 may be
only coincidence, but it seems a credit
to them.)

the company, also tax benefits from
exports, mainly to New' Zealand, of

pretty close to theoretical tax. It has,
on occas i orls improved profits despite
reduced sales, and the high earning rate
on total funds (16.8 percent at last

a tribute to managerial efficiency,
In J une i ast yea r the Chartist said
that Electrical Equipment shares (then
$2.40) had been unable to rise above
$2.55 since the 1965 break in the ris-
ing trend, and the stock was likely to
have a sidewise movement until this
level was decisively broken. It appears
that Electrical Equipment is once again
escalating. Investors might as well
clamber on for the ride,

IS GEARED TO THE GROWTH OF AUSTRALIA
Through transport and power and many other means, Olympic products and services are making a
tremendous daily contribution to Australian agriculture.
It is a far cry from the days when Australia's first wheat crop was laboriously hand-hoed near Sydney,
to the eighteen million acres put under wheat in recent years. Since the first few sheep began to graze
here soon after wheat was first cultivated, Australia has come to lead the world in wool production.
Whatever aspect of agriculture one studies, the story of expansion is one of great advances.
In modern times, the all-Australian Olympic organisation has been closely geared to this growth, and
to similar development in other industries. It is proud to serve Australia by making what Australia needs,
to the satisfaction of a fast-maturing nation.

MINING
NAUC's Tungsten Operations
KING ISLAND SCHEELITE
LIMITED has been very much
in the public eye, as it is Aus-
tralia’s largest producer of scheelite,
an ore of tungsten which is at record
levels on overseas metal markets. But
for various reasons the other local pro-
duceis of tungsten ore, Abeifoyle
Holdings Limited and North Aus-
trahan Uranium Corporation N.L, have
been bypassed by those wanting to
speculate in this metal. Aberfoyle
Holdings produces only a small quantity
of tungsten ore in the form of wol-
tram; tin, the price tor which has been
r , r , • r
tatling, still torms the ma or part ot
„ T incc CAn “ r r . •
its output. In 1966, 609 tons of tin
}.j 1 • .
concentrates was produced against 162
r ir 7 „ r
tons ot woltram concentrates. In
addition to this, Aberfoyle has a con-
trolling interest in Ardlethan Tin N.L.,
which has not been doing very well. It
also has a large interest in Green-
bushes Tin N.L, which has also been
in difficulties.
These reasons do not £xist in the
case of North Australian Uranium
Corporation, which is itself a subsidiary
of Aberfoyle Holdings. NAUC operates
a mine in which wolfram is the pre-
dominant ore. Its mine at Storeys
Creek, in Tasmania, produces about
three times as much wolfram as tin.
In addition to this mine, the company
operates a tin dredge at New Dorset,
also in Tasmania, but the inclusion of
the tin produced by the dredge still
leaves wolfram in first place,
Xhe dredge has been going through
very poor g roU nd until recently. In
1965, average production of tin con-
centrates per four-week period was 12
tons; in 1966 this fe n to 7 tons per
period and the dredg ing operations
lost $52 000 . This uneconomic ground
persisted through to Jan last, and
1 ided one reason to avoid the
, f , ir
shares, in spite ot the woltram pro-
,,. T , ,
duced by the company s underground
. TT 1 j ?
mine. However, dredge production
r , T ’ & , 1 . ,
figures for anuary were at better levels
, ~
(12./5 tons), and production figures
ebruary m T amtam improvement
° f 15 : 0 . 5 tons ‘ lt 1S to ° late in the year
for \ tbl f improvement to overcome a
P»'°bable repetition of last year s loss on
dredging operations, but at least the
outlook is better now.
A more salient reason for the com-
pany’s unpopularity as a tungsten ore
producer is the fact that it has not
been able to reap the full benefit of
higher tungsten prices, due to the in-
cidence of a short-term sales contract
on part of its wolfram production. This
contract is believed to expire shortly
and, although there remains only three
months till the end of the company’s
year, some additional revenue may be
expected from this source in this 1
financial year, and rather more next
year, depending on the actual price
of the metal.
Other items which are favorable to
the company are the reversion to a
one-shift operation (in 1966 the run-
ning of two shifts increased operating
costs), and a capital profit earned from
the sale of the Mount Cleveland min-
ing right by the Aberfovle Tin Develop-
ment Partnership, in which NAUC has
a one-quarter interest. This item is
worth $25,000 to the company this
year.
With 1 ower operating costs, improved
grades of ore for dredging, and higher
tungsten prices for all of its production
in the near future, NAUC is likely to
have quite a good year perhaps
approaching the 1965 figure of
$273,000, but certainly better than last
year’s $139,000. Continued high prices
for tungsten and its ores should improve
the outlook even further.
THE closure earlier this month by
Loloma Mining Corporation N.L.
of its Stannary Hills tin-mining
operation in North Queensland comes
as no surprise, as it was foreshadowed
last December by the company’s chair-

man, Mr. N. B. Theodore. Even so,
it serves as a salutary reminder of the
facts of life in mining ventures.
The area of Stannary Hills, some dis-
tance from Irvinebank, was originally
estimated to contain approximately
800,000 cubic yards of alluvial wash,
assaying ljlb. of tin oxide per cubic
yard. In actual operations the grade
turned out to be only slightly more than
half of this figure, and the operation
lost $190,000 in its first year (of forty-
five weeks) to June 30, 1966. In the
period from that date to the cessation
of operations earlier this month it has
probably cost the company a similar
sum.
The considerable error in estimation
of grade was aggravated, of course, by
the decline in tin prices since the ven-
ture commenced. When the first ship-
ments of tin concentrates were made in
September, 1965, the London Metal
Exchange tin price was £stg.lsos per
ton; at present it has been fairly steady
around the £stg.l2oo mark since
November last year. The combination
of these two factors meant that it was
not worth while treating the original
ore reserves to their full extent, although
even if the price of tin had held at its
former levels the operation would still
have lost money. It appears that about
270 tons of tin concentrates was pro-
duced (an estimated figure as total pro-
duction has not yet been announced),
and if the company had received an
extra £stg.3oo per ton its additional
revenue would have been slightly over
$200,000, not enough to offset the reduc-
tion in ore grade.
JF the operation had been a large one,
requiring a considerable amount of
capital for extensive plant and equip-
ment, the failure of the original esti-
mates to come good would be regret-
table; fortunately the plant, which is
fairly small, can easily be dismantled
for use in other areas the company is
testing, perhaps more thoroughly than
the Stannary Hills lease.
It is paradoxical that new mining
ventures appear to carry less risk when
they are initiated in times of relatively
low metal prices than when metal
prices are buoyant. Of course, there
are plenty of marginal mines which
operate profitably when metal prices
reach a high enough figure, and for that
matter all mines rely on metal prices.
There are, too, many mineral deposits
which are waiting on price increases to
be commercially feasible. But recent
Australian experience has contained
an undesirable proportion of new min-
ing ventures which appear to have re-
lied too much on buoyant metal mar-
kets and not enough on geological and
metallurgical preparation. Desirable as
this is, it is not always within the re-
sources of those willing to provide a
small amount of risk capital on a specu-
lative basis.
The fact remains that the element
of risk can only be reduced by testing
and development, such as close drilling
of ore bodies, pilot treatment plants,
and so on.

Surplus for Copper
THE picture of weakness in the
copper market is rapidly becom-
ing clear. A slowdown in growth
of U.S. non-military consumption has
been the latest development.
Net copper consumption by U.S.
fabricators in January was 180,140 short
tons well down on the January,
1966, level of 211,551 tons. Unfilled
sales contracts were also down, from
383,658 to 361,707 tons. And stocks of
copper were up from 512,362 to
553,627 over the year.
The U.S. market has been the under-
lying strength in copper for almost a
year, as European and other consumers
switched to aluminium and demand
generally levelled out, reflecting eco-
nomic trends. For instance, in Ger-
many, which has been worst hit of all
major consumers by the world short-
age, the amount of copper used for elec-
trical conductors fell 12 percent last
year, while aluminium use in the same
field rose 43 percent.
Although the .motor industry has
been in trouble, the main cause of the
U.S. consumption weakness is not
general economic trends but substitu-
tion, despite the low producer price in
that country.
The latest estimate of the overall
situation by London dealer Philipp
and Lion is that there is now “a defi-
nite surplus of the order of 5000 to
10,000 tons a month.” This is with
Zambian output at 75 percent of
normal and most of the rest of the
world’s producers at full blast. This
“surplus” (although some would not
agree that it yet exists) is being taken
up in stock building, the dealer believes.
Until the U.S. wage contracts for
copper workers are re-negotiated in
mid-year, this is likely to continue a
factor, as consumers have had some
very hard times in recent years from
unexpected supply cuts.
THE figures on London Metal
Exchange lead stocks revealed a
drop from 8500 tons to 6125 tons
in the latest week available. This is the
basis for the unexpected lift in prices to
around £stg.B3 a ton against the £7B
it touched a few weeks ago. Forward
buying by a U.S.-connected dealer has
kept the, three months’ price up also.
Most of the metal leaving the LME
warehouses went to China, and a fur-
ther 7000 or 8000 tons is believed to
be contracted to go east. China was
about the only market left for the pro-
ducers’ operators, and sales have been
pushed in that direction—thus enabling
U.S. producers to maintain their profit
margins by holding the producer price.
However, this is only a temporary
situation, and the market shows little
sign of having reached a longer-term
plateau. As the production-consumption
pattern becomes clearer a more definite
trend will develop—the forecast surplus
for this year was, after all, only mar-
ginal.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
c o me anticipation of BHP’s packed “supplementary report,”
Marlin’s commercial declaration, brought the shares up
toodly 8 cents to $6.36. No such happy reaction greeted the
ik of New South Wales bonus dividend: here the discontent
(s measured by a 2 cent drop to $5.16. The markets punished
Wormald (down 23 cents to 72 cents) and Tulloch (down 13
cents to 39 cents), but held out some hopes to Davies Coop by
raising prices 7 cents to 36 cents. Not all the miners took their
key from Western Mining, which reached $6.86 by a 42 cent
leap; Mounts Isa, Lyell, and Morgan came back.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
The Latest Group of Five
IN the course of writing about a
group of five companies over a
period of six weeks, a number of
things can happen, especially at this
time of the year when half-yearly re-
ports are being published in quantity.
Shortly after the introductory article
was written, the share prices of the
five companies were as shown in
Column A of the following schedule and
the latest prices at the time of writing
this article are as in Column B:

There have been some considerable
variations for stocks such as these, whose
prices would not normally vary more
than a cent or two either way. APPM’s
price has risen 9 cents (6.9 percent),
Clyde has fallen 5 cents (5.8 percent),
Email has risen 6 cents (12.5 percent),
Olympic has risen 7 cents (10.3 per-
cent) and only H. C. Sleigh has failed
to show much variation, for the rise
has only been 2 cents (3.6 percent). The
“investment index” is, however, down
2.8 percent, so most of these stocks
have moved in a contrary direction, and
two of them quite substantially.
Associated Pulp & Paper Mills:
So far as I can see, nothing new has
occurred since the article was written
on this company and the shares then
were priced at $1.30. The reduction
in the interim dividend (particularly
when the final has never been the same
as the interim) makes the likely divi-
dend for the full twelve months of
1966/67 a good subject for a guessing
game. Will it be 9 percent, 8 percent,
or some other percentage? There are
also some stories around that APPM
is going to have a very good second
half; in this event, earnings and divi-
dends could well be in excess of the 10
cents and 9 cents respectively that I
had suggested.
Clyde Industries:
The assessment of this company
should not be materially affected by the
interim report, but the drop in the share
price is just a little disconcerting. Short
of any major calamity, it would seem
that anyone who bought the shares at
current prices could only make money
in the short to medium term.
Email:
The announcement which has just
been made indicates that 1966 profits
recovered completely to the levels
which have existed since 1958. It looks
as though shareholders can expect the
earning rate to fluctuate between 5
cents and 6.5 cents per share, with
perhaps an occasional fall below" this
level. Looking at the average earnings
per share for the last nine years, the
present price seems about right still. I
would guess that there is a strong
possibility that the dividend rate will
be put back to 5 cents per share (10
percent) and, in this case, the dividend
yield will be attractive. Some may still
be concerned about the 1965 lapse in
the dividend rate after all, it is pos-
sible to get a secure return of between
7 and 8 percent.
Olympic Consolidated:
The interim report says that profits
were up about 15 percent after pro-
viding for tax and for copper price
fluctuations. The latter provision sug-
gests that the cable operation may be
much more important than was sug-
gested in the article, which based its
conclusions on the probable trends in
motor-vehicle registrations. The con-
clusion seems to have been about right,
even though it could have been for the
wrong reasons.
H. C. Sleigh:
In the case of H. C. Sleigh the posi-
tion has become quite complicated. On
the face of it, H. C. Sleigh has sold a
profitable operation to provide the cash
to buy an unprofitable one, but this
would be a phoney over-simplification.
Firstly, there is a strong indication that
Phillips Oil has been improving quite
steadily over the period since the
shares were listed, and with the help
of H. C. Sleigh’s local expertise, there
is obviously every prospect that the pro-
ject will be profitable shortly. Accord-
ing to the last balance sheet, losses
totalled $686,000 at June 30, 1966. The
“taxable” losses may be more or less
than this figure, but it is possible that
these losses are worth about 1J cents
per share to H. C. Sleigh.
Apart from this, Sleigh seems to be
buying Phillips at several cents above
net asset backing and this is rather
strange in the circumstances. There may
be very good reasons for paying well
above market price, but one wonders
what sort of price Phillips Petroleum
would have got for its holding without
a ready buyer. The effect of this
acquisition cannot be assessed at the
moment, since there is no way of know-
ing what benefits will arise from bring-
ing Phillips under Golden Fleece.
I T is probably fair to say that no one
is expecting sudden and dramatic
growth in either dividends or earn-
ings per share from any of the five com-
panies which have been covered in this
series. Clearly this depends on the view
that any one person may have taken
about the dividend rate at any time.
The problem regarding the 1966/7
dividend has already been mentioned
so far as Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills are concerned, and there are
many who may well have been assum-
ing that Email’s dividend would hardly
exceed 3.5 cents per share this year
after the declaration of the interim
dividend.
A basis which is useful (but no means
infallible) is to assume that the current
dividend is always the sum of the last
declared interim and final dividends. I t
the case of Email, the dividend woulc
then have been 10 percent prior tc
October, 1965, 8 percent from October,
1965, to May, 1966, 6 percent from'
May, 1966, to October, 1966, and fronj
October, 1966, until the 1967 final ij
announced, the rate will be 6| percent.!
Of course, if the rate is going back to/
10 percent this year, with a percent!
final, there is going to be substantial*
growth in dividends per share in the!
short term. Even if the final dividend
should be only 5 percent, the full year’s
dividend will rise by over 30 percent
from 6J to percent, and it will cer-
tainly be taken for granted that next
year will be a 10 percent year again.
The only point to make here is that,/
for the next month approximately,
dividend yield, which is usually the one
definite factor in the assessment of a
share, cannot be precise in the case of
Email.
Because of this precision in relation
to dividend yields, it is often suggested
that a comparison of the average divi-
dend yield as measured by an index'
figure and the dividend yield available
on a share included in that index will
show whether a share has become over-
or under-priced.

Olympic 107 86 102 98 123
H. C. Sle gh 109 118 122 133 144 (
It is fairly clear that any reduction
in the rate of dividend seems to have a
depressive influence on the relation-
ship, but if so,me attempt is made to
eliminate this influence when the reduc-
tion in the rate was only temporary,
then the following relationships between
the yields on the individual stocks and
the 50 Leaders yield may be reason-
able:
APPM 15 percent higher
Clyde no clear relation-
ship
Email 25 percent higher
Olympic equal to the index
H. C. Sleigh 45 percent higher
This would suggest that only Email
is under-priced if the 10 percent divi-
dend is restored. Some under-pricing
still seems to exist in the case of Clyde
and Olympic, and these shares seem
preferable because of the stability of
dividend income over the last five
years.


THE CHARTIST SAYS:
Look to Sleigh, Email
for Recovery
HC. SLEIGH shows the best recovery potential on
current market action, with consideration possibly
given to Email for the longer term. The charts repro-
duced on the stocks under review can be identified with the
overall trend of the market on index No. 15 in terms of
“bull and bear” phases since 1961. Certainly they could not
be recommended on the past performance of the past six
years. The Security Analyst in the issue of February 4, 1967,
listed the ideal way to make an appraisal of a company in
terms of past trends: assess the likely future growth in the
demand for the product, make some judgment of the com-
pany’s share of that market, examine trends in the price
which had been previously obtained for the product, and
again estimate the likely trend in the future. There was,
however, no mention of probably the most important trend:
that of the supply and demand in relation to the company's
price movements in the stock market and to relating this to
the particular phase in the life cycle of the stock and the
overall trend of the averages.
Email and H. C. Sleigh have represented recessive phases
which are reverting to recovery situations, Olympic Indus-
tries cyclical, and APPM and Clyde Industries are both
now beginning to show a recessive tendency. None of the
stocks has been really able to move against the general
trend, and investors who bought near the high points - in
1960 would all show a capital loss. Dividends must be poor
compensation in some cases.
The Security Analyst also suggested that the Chartist
may well be best able to judge future market movements,
but there are times when it can be difficult to assess a chart
formation before completion of the pattern. It should be
pointed out to the investor unfamiliar with charts that some-
times years of consolidation are necessary before a situation
can be accurately assessed and a prediction given. However,
they do illustrate downtrends when they exist. It is much
safer to wait until there is an actual break in the downtrend
before buying stocks because they look “cheap” in relation
to the price range over a given time.
APPM was reviewed in March, 1966, and at that time
appeared to be forming a base after breaking the down-
trend in January of that year. However, the technical posi-
tion deteriorated in August and a break in the support levels
back to 1961 indicated that the stock was more likely to
resume a downtrend. It was indicated in October, 1966,
that prices could eventually fall close to the $1 level. Sales
have already been recorded as low as $1.23 this year, and
the stock should be avoided at present. Last sale price on
7/3/’67 $1.38.
CLYDE INDUSTRIES: At current prices of around 80
cents, this stock appears to be “cheap” when compared to
the top levels around $2 in 1960. There certainly is no tech-
nical reason to buy at present, as a strong major down-
trend exists and the chart suggests that the decline could
continue even further to approximately the 60-cent level.
The best performance was the two-year 25 percent uptrend
which broke early 1965. Last sale price on 7/3/67 81
cents.
EMAIL was included in the appliance group in July,
1966. At that time it was suggested that 37 cents could be
the low point. Consolidation has since taken place above that
level, and although prices have been as high as 54 cents in
recent weeks, it would be more likely to expect Email to
improve gradually with the general market toward the end
of the year. Resistance would be very strong about 70 cents
due to the four years of trading above that level before
the sharp decline which commenced in 1965; it would be
unlikely to expect Email to rise above the 70 cents resistance
level. Last sale price on 7/3/’67 52 cents.
OLYMPIC CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES LTD. has
shown more cyclical tendencies, and investors who sold on
the break in trend about $l.lO in 1963 would have avoided
considerable erosion of capital. The current technical posi-
tion does not indicate very much strength; if prices recede
below 60 cents in the short term the decline could possibly
continue to between 45 cents and 50 cents. Last sale price on
7/3/’67 - 73 cents.
H. C. SLEIGH is again a clear case of selling on a break
of the 10 percent uptrend in 1964 about the $l.lO level prior
to the commencement of the recessive phase. The steep
decline eventually took prices to a low of 54 cents at the
beginning of the curent year. The stock could be safely held
providing it stays above this level; the present base suggests
that prices could recover close to the $1 level. It appears to
have slightly above average market strength and has been
able to move against the general trend over the past two
weeks. Prices have moved up to 60 cents on fairly high
turnover. Last sale price on 7/3/’67 59 cents.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Coping with
the Drab
March Blues
ALTHOUGH THE MARKET con-
tinues to be apathetic, interim reports
are generally very good. With interest
rates significantly lower than a few
months ago, the market must ultimately
reflect the better performance of com-
panies. Maybe it will be later than
sooner, but it’s bound to come. What
impresses me is that the trading of
most companies in the second quarter
is better than the first quarter.
A few years ago the small company
with the high earning rate was all the
vogue. The tables have now turned,
and this type of company has fallen
out of favor. Perhaps it’s time that this
type of stock is considered again. Take
Protector. Although earnings have risen
steadily over the past four years and
shareholders have been duly rewarded
by both issues and dividend increases,
the share price has fallen 25 percent
in the past year.
Closer to home is Eglo Engineering.
This week directors announced an in-
creased profit and a rise in the interim
dividend to 6 percent. Yet the share
price could barely hold 84 cents. These
shares deserve to be much closer to
$l.
Apart from the bevy of interim re-
ports, there has also been the occa-
sional takeover or merger. Being a
shareholder of Buckinghams, I was
naturally interested in the proposed
marriage to F. J. Palmer. As the share
price of each company so well illus-
trates, both Buckinghams and F. J.
Palmer have barely kept their heads
above water in recent years. Perhaps
directors are working on the mathe-
matical principle of two minuses
making a plus. But to ,me, what specu-
lative appeal Buckinghams had has
gone. Selling out of the stock at 15
cents at least results in a few dollars’
profit.
Apart from Buckinghams and F. J.
Palmers, there are few listed retailers
that are not moving ahead strongly.
One of the most impressive performers
in the industry must surely be Waltons.
Ever since Marcus Clark was taken
over, the market has been cautiously
marking Waltons’ shares. The interim
report would seem to effectively remove
these doubts.
Another industry on the way up is
the appliance industry. In grand style,
Malleys continues to surge ahead.
However, the prize for the most spec-
tacular current performance must go
to Email. Profits of this company
are expected to double for the year
just past. Way back in the appliance
field is the Adelaide-based Simpson
Pope. Hit by the H. G. Palmer col-
lapse in 1965, bad debts write-off
totalled almost slm. last year. Coming
on top of a generally restrained con.
sumer market, it’s a wonder that they
were able to scrape up any profit at
all. The last report by the company
was at the annual meeting in Novem-
ber, when the chairman stated that
sales were in line with the budget.
There seems at least some room for
recovery in the present share price of
28 cents. I bought 1000 shares.
The interim report of Simpson Pope
is unlikely to provide too much hope
for the immediate future. Nevertheless,
it should be better than Wormalds.
Passing the interim dividend is a pretty
dismal measure, but probably not
quite as dismal as the market believes.
With Rothmans’ price movements fresh
in the mind, I’m hoping that there
will be some reaction to the 25 cents
fall. So far, I’m premature in my
thinking, because the shares have fallen
a further five cents. Oh, well!
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
ICCO Simpson Pope 28 $287
SCO Wormalds 75 $241
SOLD
1000 Buckinghams 15 $147
There is still $251 left in the
account. If I can last through the
March blues, I’m sure we’ll be enter-
ing better times.

Man on the Land
Vertical Integration May Link
Beer and Broilers
CHICKEN AND BEER go well
together on the table. They also would
appear to go well together as a business
operation. This is hard to see, at first,
but the point is that each, as a com-
modity, is ready-made for vertical
integration.
Breweries, through the tied-house sys-
tem of retailing and the contract pur-
chase of hops and barley from the far-
mer, have for long indulged in vertical
integration. Indeed, they were function-
ing in this way before the economists
even invented the words to describe it.
The strong rumor that a large brewery
is considering going into the broiler
business in a big way in Australia could
be close to the wingbone. The time for
such an entry is ripe.
In the past two years the broiler busi-
ness, for all but the largest suppliers,
has been getting worse.
Among the big processors the com-
petition is intense, with some doing
better than others, and a few doing
badly. The APPU has recently con-
ducted a survey into the broiler busi-
ness in Victoria and claims that at least
$175 per thousand birds is needed to
cover normal running costs, interest
charges, and principal repayments, and,
at the same time, to provide the owner-
operator with a reasonable but not
extravagant living allowance to cover
his labor and managerial skill. These
costs do not include the cost of land.
The survey claims that, in fact, the
top broiler sheds in Victoria are only
returning $l6O per thousand birds.
The average is returning between ,$lOO
and $l4O and some as low as $5O per
thousand. The APPU survey warns
that unless the owner-operator has a
reasonably long-term agreement for
the supply of broilers to a processor
then his financial position is most in-
secure. Some growers, it is claimed,
are seeking advances from processors
in lieu of future payments for broilers
in order to pay day-to-day living
costs. In spite of this the broiler mar-
ket in Australia is expanding, says the
APPU report.
As a producer organisation the
APPU is concerned with what appears
to be loopholes in the contracts issued
by the processors. It is claimed that
some newcomers to the business have
raised only one or two batches of
chickens, not enough to pay off their
sheds, and have been simply advised
that their services are no longer re-
quired. Yet two years ago processors
were running advertisements seeking
new contract farmers and were prom-
ising secure contracts.
The APPU (and we have had our
differences with this organisation) is to
be congratulated for moving quickly
in observing and recording these moves
in the broiler business as they happen.
None of us knows where vertical inte-
gration is going to end. In some re-
spects it could be the best thing that
ever happened to farming but, as in
everything else, much depends on the
imponderables. Unless there is a rapid
change for the better it is going to be
difficult to convince broiler growers
that the contract system has any ad-
vantages and no one could then blame
them if they sought a producer board
control of broiler marketing.
What is happening in broilers right
now is therefore of vital importance
to all farmers. It is by no means a
phase peculiar to Australia. The im-
ponderables of vertical integration are
worrying farmer organisations in many
countries.
The International Federation of
Agricultural Producers and the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organ-
isation recently financed a study on
vertical integration by Professor John
Higgs. In his report, just published,
Professor Higgs says that it is clear that
the “onus is on the farmer and his
associations to prepare for it. At the
same time, old-fashioned and some-
times archaic institutional apparatus
(producer boards?) has no place in a
modern economy.
“Many farmers are still substantially
traditional people; it is less that they
are unwilling to face change than they
do not know how to. It is here that
research, investigation, and enlightened
thought must play a part. Without im-
petus the farming community alone
may fail to find the way; particularly
does it need help in the development
of forms of associations and co-
operation. Such help does not imply,
however, massive financial aid, for this
can and should be found both within
the agricultural industry and the inte-
grating industries.”
Higgs says that the nu,mber of com-
modities wholly suited for integrated
production is limited as is the present
market outlet for integrated production.
There are numerous uncertainties about
types, forms, and extent of integrated
production, but one thing is certain
integration will play an increasing role.
He says it is abundantly clear that the
choice or decision may not rest so
much with the far.mer as with the retail
chains and the large-scale firms in the
processing, feedstuffs, and distributing
industries. Keenness of competition
within these industries could lead to
a greater development than now seems
probable.
Although Professor Higgs’ study is
based largely on observation of trends
in U.S.A. and Europe, it is appropri-
ate to what is happening in Australia.
The APPU survey is a good start here.
As we have so many symposiums on
so many subjects it strikes us that one
on vertical integration (now, while it
is happening) could pay dividends. In
many ways Australia could give a lead
to the rest of the world.
Compared with other countries we
have a high standard in agriculture;
Australian farmers have (despite their
differences) achieved a relatively high
degree of organisation and we do not
have the problem of chronically un-
economic, peasant-type farming com-
munities. The part of Professor Higgs’
report which needs stressing is the
bit about the onus being on the farmer
to prepare for vertical integration and
that the role of Government should
be to guide and help him.
In the past, in Australia, it has
been so very simple. When in trouble
the farmer calls for a board and a
subsidy. It is not going to be that
simple ever again. Farmers’ organis-
ations, the universities, the Govern-
ment, maybe even Prince Philip’s study
group, but somebody, should be examin-
ing this trend in detail now even if a
firm conclusion is not in sight.
In one or two countries, says Pro-
fessor Higgs, there is a possibility of
integration between the producer and
consumer co-operatives. It will occur to
many farmers that, in part, some of
these systems have existed in Australia
for years, and this further strengthens
our point that an Australian-based
study of vertical integration could be
welcomed by observers in many parts
of the world.

Cheddar Makers
CHEDDAR, A VILLAGE of perhaps
3000 souls on the flank of the Mendip
hills in Somerset, has been making
its famous cheese for longer than
history relates. The first mention
of “Cheder” cheese in the litera-
ture appeared in 1666. The refer-
ence clearly implies that even then the
little town was already renowned
throughout England for its cheese.
Bailey in 1721 broadly outlined the
method of manufacture evolved by the
villagers. His description tells us that
the process employed in his day to
make “large, fine, rich, and pleasant
cheese” has remained substantially the
same until now.
Indeed, the biggest change in the

village in the intervening years has
been wrought as a result of Cox’s acci-
dental discovery of the fascinating caves
that interlace the limestone, sometimes
only a few feet below the footings of
the factories in the village. People flock
to Cheddar these days to view the
beauty of the stalagmites and to eat
strawberries and cream. Nobody goes
there any more to study their peculiar
method of cheese-making.
For this they are now coming to
Highett, on the outskirts of Melbourne.
There, in the CSIRO Division of Dairy
Research, reigns the recognised master
of cheddar cheese making Mr. J.
(“Joe”) Czulak, a fast-talking expatri-
ate Pole who came here in 1951.
Back in the mid ’sos Joe started
studying the traditional process, and in
particular the changes taking place in
the curd while it is being cheddared.
This is the curd-fusing stage during
which the loose granules of curd are
compressed into slabs, which are
stacked laboriously by hand one on top
of the other and turned and re-turned
while the whey drains from them. He
learned that the repeated compression
and deformation under its own weight
gave the curd its smooth, fibrous
character, and realised that the tedious
and heavy martual labor could be
mechanised and the time allowed for
the cheddaring process shortened.
He then considered the next stage
in which the great slabs are milled into
finger-size pieces to allow salt, in pre-
cise quantity, to be mixed in very
thoroughly. He devised another
machine to do all this painstaking
work. Then for good measure he went
back and studied the very first stage
when the milk is curdling in the vats
and the degree of acidity, speed of curd
formation, and resultant release of
whey must be carefully regulated. To
facilitate this he developed an auto-
matic control system. By 1958 he was
able to make, on a pilot scale, the first
chedctar cheese ever to be made un-
touched by human hand, as the phrase
has it.
Over the past several years he has
been busy co-operating with the engin-
eering firm of Bell Bryant to build
commercial models of his original
gadgetry. Last week he was ready to
demonstrate mechanised cheddar-cheese
making on a factory scale to the in-
dustry. The wraps were taken off the
main machine, the first of its kind and
the last of the three to be made, before
the curious gaze of a large crowd
comprising cheesemakers from Aus-
tralia and the world.
It is a monstrous thing measuring
some 55ft. long, 14ft. high, and 9ft.
wide, and reputed to cost around
$150,000. But it enables cheese to be
turned out continuously at the rate of
60001 b. an hour when coupled with the
milling-salting machine and the curd
controller. The latter costs about as
much as a large car, and the salter is
priced in the vicinity of $60,000.
Nearly two dozen salters have been sold
already by Bell Bryant to factories in
Australia, New Zealand, England, and
the U.S.A. A New Zealand factory
bought the plant at Highett before it
was even washed down after the demon-
stration. Bell Bryant confidently expect
many more quick orders for the vital
cheddaring machine. Those factories
which have already installed the salter
will need it and the control unit to
attain automation.
Joe’s enterprise has not only intro-
duced a new epoch in cheese-making,
but has given Australia a novel machin-
ery manufacturing business which
should become a valuable foreign
money earner. Our lead in automated
cheese-making could give the dairy
industry a much-needed boost. We
have won an export market worth $l3
million from a surplus of 24,000 tons
of cheddar made by the old-fashioned
method. The cheese produced by the
mechanised system is of at least equal
quality.
FOLLOWING THE DROUGHT, a
plague of locusts is forecast. Entomolo-
gists consider that this year the east-
ern States, and perhaps South Austra-
lia, are facing one of the period
major outbreaks of locusts. The next
few weeks will be decisive, when the
second - generation fliers begin to
appear. If the weather continues
favorable, a third generation over-
lapping with the second could be pro-
duced this year. As a result pastures
and crops could be subjected to con-
stant predation throughout the autumn.
Serious damage to young cereal crops
and the new season’s pastures would
carry over into the spring. The ento-
mologists are, in effect, warning us
that the stage is being set now for
another calamity.
Mr. R. M. Watts, the Director-
General of the New South Wales
Department of Agriculture, has already
appealed to the State’s landholders to
rally to the defence! The Tasmanian
tragedy has provided them with an
object lesson in neighborliness. By
responding to Mr. Watts’ call the
farmers and graziers of New South
Wales can play the good neighbor to
Queensland, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia. The Australian plague locust
(Chortoicetes terminifera) multiplies
mainly in north-central and north-
eastern New South Wales, but Queens-
land also has some fairly extensive and
active breeding grounds of her own.
Preparations to meet the expected
onslaught are in hand. Supplies of
insecticide (lindane) have already been
sent out to the Pastures Protection
Boards. Farmers can obtain their
requirements free from their local
Board. They should watch for hatch-
ings so that they can be ready to
launch an insecticidal assault when
the hoppers emerge.


LETTERS
The Family Farm
Allow me to congratulate the writer of
your article “Threats to the Family
Farm” in “Man On the Land” (8.,
Feb. 25).
He is perfectly right in stating that
many farmers oppose subsidies more
from a knowledge of what lies at the
end of that economic road than from
sheer die-hard independence.
I believe he has missed two most
important points in the clinching sec-
tion of his argument:
1. The early and steep rise in the
income tax assessment rate.
2. Death duties.
On the first count it does not need
an actuary to see that with properties
priced in the $lOO,OOO to $250,000
range, while not of a size nor income
earning capacity to be rated as more
than family farms; and the income tax
rates reaching 50 cents in the dollar
as early as $9OOO annual net income,
any purchaser wishing to make a pro-
perty pay for itself is going to have a
hard time of it.
Say he buys a $lOO,OOO place and
makes 10 percent or $lO,OOO net income
taxable. Income tax will be $3402.
Estimate $2600 for living expenses of
family and he has $4OOO left to provide
fresh working capital and amortise his
debt. If he wants to keep his opera-
tional or working capital up to date
he has $2OOO a year to pay off his debt;
a 50-year job. If he doesn’t keep it
intact he eventually won’t be able to
make his 10 percent.
However, he accepts the position,
we’ll say, and lives a hard and frugal
life for 50 years and then dies. Tax
law has allowed him to spend $BOO a
year on life assurance, so he could have
about $15,000 to pay death duties of
some $23,000, and as some of his family
have gone from the farm but are bene-
ficiaries, the person taking it over, even
if a beneficiary, recommences the task
of consolidation.
To consolidate land holdings into
sufficiently large units for really eco-
no,mical operation it is likely that lessee
management and operation companies
could be formed. In some cases they
could possibly employ their own land-
lords as well as specialists in the vari-
ous phases of the farm operations.

British Sea Power
After Julian Amery’s article (8., Feb.
18) giving cogent reasons why Britain
needs to maintain a military presence
East-of-Suez, the article “Harold Wil-
son’s Australian Shadow Play” (8.,
March 6) is short-sighted. The reason
for creating a military base in Singa-
pore was, and still is, to provide a
means for exercising sea power (includ-
ing its air component). The same
applies to Cockburn Sound and the
construction by Australia of a naval base
there for the RAN is some 50 years
overdue.
Granted that Singapore is unlikely
to bite the hand that feeds her, but it
would be foolish for Britain or Aus-
tralia to rely in the years ahead on
using a base in territory over which
they have no political control.
Britain’s stake East-of-Suez may
merely be her investments and trade,
but Australia’s stake could be her future
as a nation. She should cut the cackle
and get on with the construction of
her base at Cockburn Sound which her
friends will need to use if they are to
help her.

Anti-Tanner
I have never seen such an insulting
cartoon which you allowed to be pub-
lished (8., Feb. 18) anent the Queen
and the Duke of Edinburgh. Attack the
Duke, but please do not attack the
Queen. “Tanner” should hang his head
in shame.
All of your cartoonists are “Third
Raters.” '
Is your magazine anti-English? The
Queen has no way of defending her-
self.
I have been a subscriber to the
Bulletin for so long and so many years,
but I shall never buy another.
And would you mind printing this
letter? It would please me greatly.

Catholic Schools
I would like to comment on some
aspects of John Manning’s interesting
article “Are Catholic Schools Really
Necessary” (8., Feb. 4). He says that
“for the pundits, the defeat of Mr.
Allan Fraser, a long-time ALP cham-
pion of State Aid around the Goulburn
district, was pertinent evidence that
State Aid registered a poor rating at
the polls.”
Hundreds of Mr. Fraser’s previous
supporters particularly those who ad-
mired him for his work within his
party on the school aid question
would have felt obliged to vote against
him for his attitude to our commitment
in Vietnam. A majority of Catholics
throughout Australia felt that in this
election they had no other choice but
to put the welfare and security of their
country before the welfare of their
schools, and surely this is a tribute to
the schools in which they were edu-
cated.
It should be clear to politicians that
under different circumstances parents
would vote 1 for education. This was
evident in both the last N.S.W. and
Queensland State elections, and will
almost certainly be the major issue in
the next elections in N.S.W.
Mr. Manning suggested that the
Catholic parochial schools should close
and .that we could manage quite-well
without them. Perhaps this is so, but it
seems that we would solve one problem
merely to give the State an impossible
one. We know that Australia is des-
perately short of educational resources,
so surely we should make the best uses
of all existing resources for the good
of all. In spite of Mr. Manning’s tilt
at septuagenarian teachers (brothers
and nuns) there are thouands of excel-
lent teachers in the parochial schools
who would be lost to the Australian
education system if the schools were to
close.
I agree with Mr. Manning that
Catholics, along with most other Aus-
tralians, are getting fed up with State
Aid politics, but the way is now open
for all this to end. All major parties
now agree on the principle of State
Aid and it is up to politicians and the
Bishops to arrive at some sensible
formula which will be of benefit to all
Australians.

The Devil's Advocate
Having read your critic’s exposition
of “The Devil’s Advocate” at St.
Martin’s Theatre (8., Feb. 25) I was
forced to question whether anything
of value could be gained by your
readers from such a prejudiced piece
of writing.
The dictionary definition of “critic”
is given as “a person who attempts to
judge the merit of works of art or
literature,” but in this article your
critic was so embroiled in his loathing
of the novelist’s personal “success” that
his entire interpretation of the play was
colored.
Too often I find when looking to
this column for guidance as to the
worth of current productions one must

on the personal tastes of the critic,
and the inevitable judgment that if the

The Melbourne See
Henry Grant’s suggestion (8., Feb. 25)
of a public debate to assess the most
suitable successor to Dr. Simonds in
Melbourne deserves to be taken up.
THE BULLETIN’S long tradition and
established position in Australian his-
tory makes it a reasonable place to
begin such discussion.
Bishop Fox must be given great
credit for the way he has looked after
the Archdiocese lately. One fears that
he has a very good chance of carrying
on but Melbourne would be too big
a job for him.
To appoint Archbishop Knox, who
has spent his life in the enclosed
atmosphere of the “Properganda” col-
lege in Rome and in the artificial world
of diplomacy of Apostolic Delegations,
would be ridiculous.
The most obvious successor is Arch-
bishop Young, who has proved himself
in winning the priests of Tasmania to
accept his liturgical and ecumenical
ideas, his positive contribution to the
university and intellectual life in
Hobart, and his happy ability to meet
people and to handle the new theology
and to initiate new ways at a parish
level show him to be outstanding
among the Australian bishops.
However, why transfer a Bishop who
wears a ring as a symbol to the reality
that he is wedded to his diocese and
his flock. Theologically it is surely
more sound that a priest of the dio-
cese should be selected by the Christian
community as was Ambrose by popu-
lar acclaim. Can’t we trust the inspira-
tion of the Holy Spirit? Many Mel-
bourne priests have the ability to be
outstanding bishops.
Melbourne is an outstanding diocese,
thanks to the masterly way Daniel
Mannix ran it. He encouraged the
priests and laity and trusted them. I
think the greatest tribute to him would
be that a priest of his diocese would
carry on his work. The above sugges-
tions indicate that there is material
available apart from the “episcopal
club/’
The recent sacking of Father Her-
bert McCabe, OP, from the editorship
of the “New Blackfriars” for expressing
his honest ideas on the Charles Davis
issue is sufficient reason and tragic
evidence why I must remain anony-
jnous.
