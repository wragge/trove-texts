The Red Page
An English Randolph
A remarkable travel book by an author
who makes Foster Fraser look like a dead
suburban grocer is The Shadow-Show, by
J. H. Curie (Methuen). The author’s life
has been as interesting and adventurous as
Marco Polo’s, and he knows how to suggest
description by a phrase instead of a chapter.
In fact, he is another Randolph Bedford—
now, alack, playing at detective stories. Like
that temporarily deceased Bedford, Curie is
a mining engineer. “I have led a glorious
life,” he crows, and rightly; for to travel
every by-way of the world, and appreciate
every footstep of the way, is a freedom not
lightly bestowed upon mortals. Born in
Scotland, this red-headed boy was unable to
go to a public-school owing to “an over-
charged nervous system.” He was sent, in-
stead, to Australia, a youth of 14. After a
short sojourn here, he went to Cambridge.
He had decided upon becoming a mining
engineer, a profession the value of which he
had seen in Australia, but he had not heard
of the existence of a School of Minem and
the Cambridge professors had apparently
never heard of mining. He left the Univer-
sity completely ignorant of his chosen profes-
sion. Germany, the Passion Play, and Wag-
ner followed; then to the Transvaal he went.
There, one of the engine-drivers of his mine
got three fingers crushed to pieces. The
author, at that moment rehearsing an ama-
teur production of “The Mikado,” was hur-
riedly called to assist.
The doctor gave chloroform, but the man’s
heart was weak, and he had to be shaken
back to consciousness. In a drowsy, sodden
voice he said to me: “Sing the Mikado’s
song”; and Dr. Nixon, hearing, took up the
scissors. Holding with both hands the
poor wretch’s head, I sang out: —
A more humane Mikado never did in Japan
exist, .
and in place of that staccato chord which
follows, the scissors snapped, and a finger
fell off. There was a shriek of agony and
writhing, and the binding up of the stump.
Then I went on:—
To nobody second, I’m certainly reckoned a
true philanthropist. ,
Again comes that staccato chord, and again,
in perfect tempo, a ‘ finger dropped. After
more shrieks’ and more sewing up, I sang
on, and at the words —
A source of innocent merriment,
the third and last finger disappeared. The
operation was over; I went out on the veldt
and was violently sick.
&
For six years Curie worked at his profes-
sion in Johannesburg. At Klerksdorp he
stayed in the house built by an earlier man-
ager—the notorious Deeming
I slept in the room that was his. One
night, about two, I awoke trembling. Close
to mv bed, in the clear moonlight, stood a
shrouded white figure. I got up and moved
towards, it; but at a spot by the wall it
seemed to sink through the floor and vanish.
I went slowly to the spot and looked down.
It was a cemented fireplace. . . .Fifteen years
later I told this. Among those who listened
was one- who made entry in a note-book.
“That mine and house belong to me now,”
he said. “I’ll have the cement up some day.”
Curie gives a delicious account of his par-
ticipation in the abortive rebellion that was
smashed by the fiasco of Jameson’s too-pre-
vious raid. In 1897 he left Africa to set out on
his extraordinary travels. Since that date he
has inspected more than 500 mines. “To-
day, at 40, I have seen the world from end
to end.” In his review of the nations of the
world, he places the Scandinavians as the
most advanced. “They belong to what we call
the ‘minor powers,’ but in the value they ex-
tract from life are altogether ahead of Eng-
lish and Americans.” His chapter on women
needs more extended quotation than can be
given in this article. His journeys included
a trip up the frozen Amur on a sledge—l 9
days and nights—22oo miles, all over Persia
and through the Russian Caspian provinces,
visits to the ruins of Babylon, the whole
range of the East, every almost inaccessible
corner in South America, and every interest-
ing city in the world. And he carried with
him a seeing eye and a humorous, philosophic
pen.
<2*
It was while at Stevenson’s grave in
Samoa that Curie thus moralised :
Why did he never use Australia? He was
there, once, at least. All that material, too!
Did the bushrangers leave him cold ? Did
he never hear of Fisher’s Ghost? Nor of the
Bunyip?. .. .Did he never meet a certain
police magistrate of Albury? I can fancy
such one saying: “Mr. Stevenson, our best
romances are Geoffrey Ilamlin, For the
Term of His Natural Life, Moondyne, and —
ahem ! — Robbery Under Arms. Read these,
I beg of > you, and such other material as I
shall delightedly put before you; then write
and make Steve Hart, Gardiner or the Jew
Boy immortal.”
The Bulletin! Why was he never asked
to edit “The Red Page”? Or was he asked,
and did he refuse? He could have done the
work from Vailima. Perhaps he didn’t
like The Bulletin; there are many very re-
spectable people who do not. But Stevenson
was not very respectable—he was great.
The blushing modesty of this page forbids
quotation of the author’s eulogy upon The
Bulletin. But the reason-—or, rather, one of
the reasons —why R.L.S. was not asked to
edit “The Red Page” was that at the time of
his three visits to Australia t (February,
1890, January, 1891, and early in 1893)
there was no "Red Page” to edit. And if
there had been, Stevenson was always a sick
man during his stay in Sydney; and the sug-
gestion that he could have done the work at
Vailima shows no knowledge of the condi-
tions governing the issue of a weekly paper
In a brilliant chapter Curie sums up the
English. The prestige of the English rests
on their balance, built up of respect for the
law, a strong sense of justice, liberty and
fair play, a fairly high standard in money
matters, and good common-sense. And it is
Eherely a quarter of a million, or, maybe, a
million, of the English who count. The rest
is mediocrity. The Englishman has charac-
ter, but he is neither brainy nor brillia'nt.
Here Italians and Frenchmen walk round
us.; by the side of educated Russians we are
children, and in the United States 10 new
thoughts are seething for one in England ; as
a nation we are mentally low down, the mass
of the people dull and narrow. The English-
man is insular, that is to say ignorant, and
intolerant of others. . . .England is the one
country, and God Himself probably sprang
from the county families If the English
had brains as well as the governing faculty
they would be politically irresistible. But
they have not... .Luxury is rampant in Eng-
land. It calls for an army to minister to
it—-an army of parasites. Your railway
guard, who hangs round for his tip, is a
parasite; he was once a self-respecting man.
„• . . .The village lives on the rich man's char-
ities, or on liis sports. Everywhere one sees
troops of specialised servants.... Purveying
to the rich is to-day the greatest industry in
England. . . .Honeycombed by parasites,
native and alien, where would England be
to-day in a great crisis?. .. .In the colonies
it is different.. . .Ir the Anglo-Japauese alli-
ance was explained in all its bearings to Aus-
tralian statesmen, and received their ap-
proyal, well and good. If not, Britain did a
toolisli act; Australia mc&ns more to her
than LO Japans. It was tlie colonial, thrown
into the balance, who won us the Boer war.
Behind the brilliant descriptive writing,
the shrewd humor and the interesting anec-
dotes, one feels a delightful personality—
another Randolph Bedford.
How Japan Manufactured her
Religion
W e expect deceit from Japan, but surely
not such a tremendous lie as her religion. If or
the exposure of this bureaucratic intrigue
that is responsible for the invention of
Mikado-worship, Bushido, and the Shinto
cult, we are indebted to Professor B. H.
Chamberlain, of the Imperial University of
Tokyo, llis pamphlet, The Invention of a
New Religion (R.P.A. 3d), shows us a new
religion in the making—to subserve practical
worldly purposes. The Japanese religion of
loyalty and patriotism is quite new. And
not only is it new, it is not yet completed ;
it is still in the process of being consciously
or semi-consciously put together by the offi-
cial class, in order to serve the interests of
that class, and, incidentally, the interests of
the nation at large. About the year 188 S
Japanese officialism grew affrighted at the
nation’s worship qf foreign ideas. It sud-
denly became necessary to invent patriotism.
.Shinto, a primitive nature cult, which had
fallen into discredit, was taken out of its
cupboard and dusted. The governing classes
insisted on the Shinto doctrine .of the
Mikado’s descent in direct succession from
the native Goddess of the Sun, thereby prov-
ing the present Mikado a god. Also, the officials
of government are not public servants, but
executants of divine authority. So Shinto,
adopted as the official religion, was furbished
up. The rights of burial and of marriage
were granted to it, and the practice was
established in all schools of bowing down
several times yearly before the Emperor’s
picture.
Unfortunately, Shinto mythology is of a
kind that “would be apt to shock even the
Japanese mind at the present day.’* So the
mythology was quietly dropped.
“Far different is the case with so-called
historical facts,’ such as the alleged founda-
tion of the Monarchy in 660 b.c. For the
truth is that, instead of going back to a re-
mote antiquity, the origins of Japanese his-
tory are recent compared with that of Euro-
pean countries. The first glimmer of genuine
Japanese history dates from the. fifth cen-
tury after Christ, _ and even the accounts
of what happened in the sixth century must
be received with caution. Japanese scholars
know this as well as we do. Bu r the Japanese
bureaucracy does not desire to have the light
let in on this inconvenient circumstance.
While granting a dispensation re the na-
tional mythology, it exacts belief in every
iota of the national. historic legends. Woe
to the native professor who strays from the
path of orthodoxy. His wife and children
will starve It is furthermore officially
taught that, from the earliest ages, perfect
concord has always subsisted in Japan be-
tween her beneficent sovereigns and a grate-
fully loyal _ people. ; t . .while the Japanese
nation, sharing to some extent in the super-
natural virtues of its rulers,' has been dis-
tinguished by a high-minded chivalry Called
Bushido, unknown in inferior lands.
“The sober fact is that no nation probably
has ever treated its sovereigns more cava-
lierly than the Japanese have done.... E-
mperors have been deposed, emperors have
been assassinated. For long centuries the
government was in the hands of Mayors of
the Palace, who substituted one infant
sovereign for another, generally forcing each
to abdicate as soon as he approached man’s
estate. .. .Even in the present reign there
have been two rebellions, during one of
which a rival Emperor was set up in one
part of the country, and a republic pro-
claimed in another.”
As for the far-famed Bushido, it was ab-
solutely unknown until a decade or two
ago! “I'he very word appears in no dic-
tionary, native or foreign, before the year
1000.. . .Bushido, as an institu ion or a code
of rules, has never existed. The accounts
given of it have been fabricated out of wtiole
cloth, chiefly for foreign consumption.”
So, in the space of a short life-time, the
new Japanese religion of loyalty and patriot-
ism has emerged. And, judged by the prag-
matic test, it works. But, in its present
state, it still lacks one important item —a
sacred book. “Certain indications show that
this lacuna will be filled by the elevation of
the more important Imperial Rescripts to
that rank, i. .In fact, a volume on the whole
duty of Japanese man, with selected Im-
perial poems as texts, has already appeared.”
Chamberlain finds in this religion, founded
on lies, the reason of the rigors of the Jap.
bureaucracy against the native liberals, who
appear in its eyes not as political opponents,
but as sacrilegious heretics. But surely not
even officials could be so stupid as to believe
this elaborate lie they have themselves in-
vented? People can always believe what it
is greatly their interest to believe. “We be-
lieve in it,” Chamberlain reports one official
saying to him, “although we know it that
it is not true.”
Clever people, the Japanese!
Compton Mackenzie
Worth remembering,, this novelist’s name
He has got only so far as a second novel, bu
each of his books, The Passionate Elopemen
(Unwin, per Hymock’s Library, publishec
last year) and (Jarnival (Bell, per Hymock’s
Library), is tremendously interesting. The
J’assionate Elopement is a dainty miniature
of au artificial age, done with delicate hu
mor, some artifice, and a delightful geniality
It is the'story of the days of the beaus a;
the Wells; and the reader cannot be offendec
by the affectatk ~s of antique type and spell-
ing, and the mannerism of carrying a wore
at the bottom of each page to be repeated
m the manner of those days, at the top ol
the next page. For the whole pretty plol
is in keeping. His hero is a dandy in beau-
tilul clothes, and his passion is as mannered
as himself. His heroine is the sentimental
innocuous maiden of Richardson’s works
and there is much of that sentimental paint-
ing of nature so common in the novels of
that time. His beaus and his ladies of the
Exquisite Mob are always in the picture.
The description of ‘‘The Publick Breakfast”
is genuine rollicking humor. And the
elopement is depicted in the epic manner of
high romance. Only at the last is there a
rude breath of actuality, with a duel whose
ending is fatal to the hearts of hero, villain
and die lady. But the author recovers himself,
and shows us his beautiful hero returning to
the artificial life as, the reigning beau at Cur-
tain Wells, “whose eccentricities would ex-
haust another volume of description. He
was the famous Beau who appeared on the
first of the month in a light-colored suit that
gradually deepened until, on the last day of
the month, it always achieved blackness.
When asked by somebody the reason of this
mode he replied that he was mourning the
flight of time : when asked farther why he
was not perpetually funereal in his costume,
he replied that the first day of the month
always_revived his hopes of immortality.”
But in his second novel, Carnival,, all this
artificiality of plot, conduct and manner is
gone. Instead of the swooning vagueness of
his‘sentimental heroine, he gives us a modern
ballet girl, drawn with an up-to-dateness and
a realism that is astonishingly vital. Gone,
too, is the neatly dove-tailed, pretty little
plot. Compton Mackenzie, after writing his
first book, seems to have discovered life; and
this story is as inconsequent, as lavish, as
discursive as life. Jenny Pearl, with her
slang, her pertness, her ignorance, her am-
bition, her ready tongue and careless, empty
heart, breathes riotous life into this delight-
ful book. Her parents, the old clown who
secretly teaches her to dance, her various
lovers, her friends in the ballet, her grotesque
husband, are all subtly, humorously, vividly
drawn, And her drifting life, her inchoate
mind, her heart perplexities, her immature
code of honor, her sufferings, her inconse-
quences, her renunciations, her trivial hap-
pinesses/are told with a very human under-
standing and a delicate sympathy. Especi-
ally subtle is the author’s analysis of Jenny’s
attitude toward mefi:,and over all is the
tragedy of the thwarted life of this beautiful
thing of youth and desire. Pictures of the
ballet-girl’s life, of the studio life of her first
lOver, of the dressing-room at the theatre, of
her home life, are done with a vr r! d realism
and a frankness that does not offend.
The book starts out with a. high heart and
a gay step : it drifts on to the girl’s maturity
with occasional glints of sunshine, but a lag-
ging sten: it has one perfect hour of pas-
sionate happiness; it lapses into just the
sort .of marriage that such a girl would
make; and it ends in a useless tragedy. But
Jennv lives through it all, an astonishing,
lovable, deliciously cheekv and high-spirited
specimen of the modern Cockney girl. Comp-
ton Mackenzie’s name, as I have hinted, is
worth remembering.
For mild, meek, mawkish, sentimental
misses, The Myrtle Reed Year Booh (Put-
nam, per George Robertson, Sydney, ss. 6d.)
should provide many a gentle, ladylike sigh
of happiness. Here, for each day of the flap-
per’s year there is a Myrtle epigram or a
Myrtle platitude. Also, a biographical sketch
and critical appreciation of the late author,
from which we select this charming para-
graph : “One day, we were discussing a
criticism of one of her books, in which it was
charged that her men characters were not at
all natural; that such men never did, nor
ever could, exist, only as they existed in
novels written by women. ‘But even if it
were so,’ she said, ‘am I not justified in
creating such characters? lam not demand-
ing any more of my men characters than real
men demand of real women ; and if by creat-
ing through my ideal characters a standard
that is above the real, which may help in
ever so small a degree to elevate the moral
standard for both men and women, have I
not in so far benefited my generation?’ ” Just
the book to harmonise with the furniture of
a lavender drawing-room.
8000 Wars
Arguments against war are about as effec-
tive as arguments against a thunderstorm.
For a nation whose emptiness invites con-
quest, national defence is a condition of
national existence, and Geese Societies and
parents who object to their sons being trained
to defend their own homes are traitors. We
may deplore war, just as we may deplore
the existence of a shark or of a typhoid
bacillus: but as long as sharks and disease
germs exist we are compelled to make previ-
sion against them. Australia dislikes war;
and if every fleet and every army were dis-
banded to-morrow, we would joyfully add our
toys to the scrap-heap. But the nations of
the world show no signs of that millennium.
Yet the arguments against war stand. If
Norman Angell can convince the nations that
their self-interest insists on the disbanding
of their armies, Australia would not protest;
and for the military training of our youth
we should merely substitute a compulsory
physical training. J. Novikow’s little work,
War and Its Alleged Benefits, with an intro-
duction by Norman Angell (Heinemann),
neatly sums up the case aeainst war. reach-
ing the same conclusions, though by a differ-
ent road, as those of the author of The Ureat
Illusion. Angell says : “Bess than a third
of the size of my book, it more ar-
guments against war in the abstract than
anything I know.” But arguments “in the ab-
stract” against such a concrete thing as war
can have no practical value.
However, here is the case nresented by
the Russian sociologist. War is a means,
never an end. Humanity wars to kill men
for food, to collar their women or their goods,
or to impose a religion, certain ideas, or a
type of culture upon them—cannibalism,
spoliation, intolerance and despotism—none
of which have ever been held to be beneficial.
But if a nation, such as Australia, did not
resist these evils, it would no longer be a
nation. Novikow’s appeal is solely to the
nations who have the power of aggressions
his arguments cannot affect the position of
the under-dingo. It is, however, his criticism
of war as a solution of evils that is most
valuable. From 1496 B.c to a.d. 1861, in
3358 years, there were 227 years of peace
and 3130 years of war, or 13 years of war to
every year of peace. In that period more
than SOUO treaties of peace meant
to remain in force for ever were
concluded. The average time they re-
mained in force is two years. “If war
is able to decide differences, how is it that
8000 wars have settled nothing, and that in
this year we feel the necessity for the 8001st
war?” And war invariably eliminates the
individuals physiologically the most perfect,
and has allowed the weakest to survive. And
in the army itself the bravest are the most
likely to get killed. And in Europe the sol-
dier spends in barracks the very years when
he is most fitted to become a father. At
present we are told in the press that Italy’s
little war with the desert is costing two
millions sterling per week. Novikow esti-
mates the maintenance of European armies
to cost over £212,000,000 a year. War can-
not, therefore, enrich “with the least expendi-
ture of labor and energy,” since the capital
employed in war is greater than that em-
ployed in nearly all undertakings. And~ the
economists admit that war never is lucrative.
Noting the fact that neither the people of
Europe nor their rulers desire war, the
author puts down the failure to disarm to
conventiqn, the dead hand of routine. May-
be ; but with Australia there is no motive
but a deep national conviction that our lives
depend on a paramount necessity for imme-
diate and effective defence. Novikow re-
marks: “I challenge anyone to cite a single
campaign consciously undertaken for the
ourposo of upholding the interests of a race.”
In a few years we may be able to provide the
Russian writer with a terrible example.
A thousand-page Catalogue of the Com-
monwealth Library has been compiled by the
librarian, Arthur Wadswor h. The library
is now classified on the up-to-date decimal
system. The method of cross-indexing is
satisfactorily carried out, and the produc-
tion of the book is typographically good. The
•ompiler states that the library committee is
devoting special attention to works connected
with Australia.

The past year has again been an active one in Australian trade, and though drier
weather prevailed during part of the year, somewhat diminishing production, the result
was, on the whole, favorable. Present trade conditions are satisfactory, but more rain
would be welcome.
During the year branches have been opened at Bowraville, Comboyne, Culcairn and
Lockhart, in New South Wales, and those at Maldon and Wonthaggi, in Victoria, have
since been closed.
The Director retiring under the provision of the Bank’s Articles of Association is
Mr. David Quixano who, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
The Bank’s Auditors, Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co., retire, and again offer
themselves for re-election.
The warrants for dividend * less Income Tax, will be issued, payable on and after the
2nd May next, to those shareholders whose names appear on the register on the 15. h inst.
By order of the Board.

“W.C.M.”: Great is the Australian postal system
and the carrying of the mails thereof. Observe: Tarago
to Braidwood (N.S.W.), 30 miles ; motor with passen-
gers, two hours ; mail coach,- live hours. Glen limes
to Inverell, 42 miles; motor, 24 hours; mail coach,
eight hours. Glen limes to Grafton, 110 miles, motor,
nine hours ; mail coach, 21 hours. Casino to Tenter-
field, 86 miles; motor, nine hours; mail coach, 15
hours. And there are other instances. Yet, when ten-
ders are called for mail-carrying, the old horse vehicle
is specified by the Department, and the enlivening
spectacle is seen in many’- towns of a transport con-
tractor hurrying passengers forward by motor, and
hurtling the mails per omnibus .through space at the
velocity of four snails an hour.

“Te Babarantiko”: According to “Chasuble” (B.
2/5/’12) :—“The Bible Society sells a complete Bible
for 6d., but it only gees back 7s. Ud. in the £ of
its whole expenditure .... As a matter of fact, the
lowest price the missionary charges is one dollar
(in the Pacific the U.S.A. dollar is always reckoneu
as 4s.), and I have, known him take 16s. for a Bible.
The price for a hymnbook is never less than 2s., and
other books are charged for in proportion. There is
no reason 1 'why brown brother, who takes up religion
as a hobby, should not pay a still' price for his reli-
gious literature, especially as he can very well afford
it, but there seems to be some justification for asking
why money, under the circumstances, should be
cadged from poor white people to keep the Bible
Society going.
* # * *
“Quarry Hill”: A pretty quarrel is being fomented
between Ballarat and Bendigo, because Bendigo asked
Minister of Mines McBride to put up £ for £ to help
a local company prospect some of the Bendigo side-
lines. The audacious request was reported side by
side with a paragraph showing that the Central
Barber’s Pole on the lied, White and Blue reef had
paid £80,000 in dividends, on a total paid-up capital
of £4000. Even admitting that this was a fluke,
why do the Bendigo mining speculators not raise
the money amongst themselves to test the side-lines
at shallow depths? Simply because such efforts have
failed time and again. And why have they failed?
Because the method of mining in Bendigo is wholly
and utterly bad. Directors, managers and miners
are uneducated and unscientific. They are old-
fashioned and antiquated, like their shafts and their
machinery. For years a small ring of directors
has controlled all the best mines on Ben-
digo, and the rush for the spoil when the guinea is
put on the board table in shillings and sixpences is
only equalled by the dash for supper when Society
attends a Government House ball. Directly the fees
have been divided, the chief aim of the directors is
to sign the cheques, make the next call, and hurry
away to another meeting up the street. Bendigo
managers are expected to work for' £4 to £7 a
week, and the companies in some cases get exactly
whaf they pay for—ignorant men who know nothing
of modern mining or its appliances, as scientifically
used elsewhere. In the rest of the cases they deserve
to get what they pay for. Look at the pipes called
shafts, the out-of-da,te - signal system, the ancient ar-
rangement of the battery stamps, the use of oil and
candles i-n place of electricity! Where is there a
proper installation of electric plant for driving the
machinery and lighting the mine below and above?
Not one Bendigo mine has Thought of buying a recent
make of suction-gas producer, which can supply power
for one-tenth of one penny per horse power per hour !
Go down below and see the plan of mining and tim-
bering ! It is economical certainly in first cost, and
leads to an excessive wages bill in the end. Too
many miners are employed, because work is not
systematic, and they work under conditions which are
a disgrace to the mining community—directors,
managers and shareholders. The death-rate from
phthisis in Bendigo is 88 per 10,000 miners, and it
should not exceed 28, if proper ventilation was pro-
vided and other improvements effected. Bendigo
mining is merely hand-to-mouth, and no mine man-
ager ever attempts to measure his ore (not his re-
serves, because the poor devil never has any ore in
reserve). He is told to stop dead work and put all
hands on to rip out whatever gold-bearing stone he
can see, and when he can’t see it, he sacks half the
men and puts the other half on to look for specks,
the way pigs find truffles with their noses. Bendigo
is the greatest and most permanent goldfield on earth,
or rather it will be, if it is not driven into decay by
bad office and worse underground management.
Even the little encouragement they get doesn’t
hinder Australian machinery manufacturers from
tackling a big thing when they get the chance. The
Brisbane Water and Sewerage Board called tenders
throughout the world for the huge pumping machinery
it wants—to lift 18 million gallons of water per 24
hours to a head of 475ft., ■ and for a distance of
4000ft. —but the reply of -Thompson and Co., of
Castlemaine (Vic.) was the only one received. The
price was £108,000, said to be the largest single
contract ever made in Australia for that class of
work.
“Vic.”: It is not correct that Victorian gold was
first discovered by Aberdeen in 1851. Believed to
have been found as far back as 1847. Anyhow, there
seems to be proof that a sheoherd brought a nugget
from Campbell’s Creek to Walsh, the Collins-street
jeweller, in 1848. The squatters hushed the gold up
as far as possible. Californian gold was first dis-
covered on the ranch of Augustus Sutter, the richest
squatter on the Pacific Slope. The miners ate up
his cattle and sheep without payment. They came
like a horde of locusts. Sutter was ruined, and died
a pauper in San Francisco. Victorian squatters
didn’t want to perish like Augustus.

When every advertising space is covered with
shrieks about linoleum polish that makes ancient
floor coverings look like something only two days out
of the warehouse, face-powder that lends the bloom
of youth to countenances on which Time has prac-
tised chip-carving, and the million other devices and
frauds whereby a sinful and ramshackle world is
made to look a darned sight younger than it is—
amidst all this it is refreshing to read that a Vien-
nese has , invented a process whereby the bright,
young cheese, fresh from the dairy, may be suddenly
stricken with extreme age—-or everv appearance of
it. No particulars are given, but it is understood
that at one stroke the fresh-complexioned cheese be-
comes a crumbling ruin, with a vast congregation of
old inhabitants, who cling tenaciously to their sacred
traditions and IJnncr Houses, and never cease. crying
out that “the time is not yet ripe.” It isn't what
you could call a healthy and moral invention, but it
is tremendously interesting and novel.
OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND, EGGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IJggs yesterday were a little brighter.— Produce
mat Ice t report.
No! No eggs this morning! They’re too expen-
sive ! — Any housewife’s report.
Eggs were a little brighter 1 Thus you see
All was not gloom in busy Sussex-street!
Poultry was dull; a sort of lethargy
Had fallen on the best of Johnson’s wheat.
Then Cheese had not arrived! I dare not say
How many buyers waited on the pier,
But when the boat arrived they turned away
When sailors called, “Cheese? No, ain’t got
none ’ere!”
But their sad hearts were made two quarters
lighter
When someone said,
Bending the while his head:
“Heggs is a little brighter!”
Eggs were a little brighter! With glad yells
The men who love them made a joyous rush;
They looked amazed upon the once-pale shells,
Each now suffused with a most perfect blush.
“W’y so they is! Thank God, this ’appy day!”
Maize might be weak and Butter almost ill,
Onions could sink, and Pollard fall away,
There’d still be joy on fragrant Sussex hill,
And song and drink ! Each sturdy market fighter,
Quite done with grief,
Proclaimed with wild relief,
“Heggs, friends! Dear Heggs! Heggs is a
little brighter!”

Do
You
Want
ĸ
Long, Heavy Hair?
Then treat your hair well. See
that it is properly fed. Growth
of every kind demands proper
food. Starved hair splits at the
ends, turns prematurely gray,
keeps short and dry. Then feed
your hair. Feed it with proper
food, a regular hair-food. Feed
it with Ayer’s Hair Vigor. Thus
help nature all you possibly can
toward giving you rich, heavy,
luxuriant hair. Ask your doctor
about your hair and about Ayer’s
iHair Vigor. Follow his advice.

VARIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Triple Expansion Rhyme.
With silken flank the ample cow
Is lolling in the meadows green;
Large perspiration damps the brow
Of toiling emperor and queen ;
The little daisies bob and bow
Their homage to Evangeline.
White is the hoof, and smooth the horn,
The sun to milking time drops low;
On splendid axles proudly borne
The royal chariots come and go ;
The dog-rose prating to, the thorn
Pink as her blushes seems to blow.
The cow-boy carols down the lane,
His care chews on with solemn jaw;
The pomp of gilded trappings vain
Upholds the majesty of law;
Oh, happy kisses, call again
The love-light yesterevening saw.
(To make it clear just what I m’ean,
I stay my music to explain:
The cow is not Evangeline;
The kingly pageant gives me pain ;
Though blushes do not dye the queen,
The milkmaid may be kissed again.)
The white milk bubbles in the pail,
The sun has dropped below the trees;
The bombs of Anarchists shall fail
To shake the court detective’s ease;
But one pink girl shall count the tale
Of pickings warm as homing bees.
The hour is late, the growing night
Sheds coolness on the quiet cream;
The palace chambers are alight,
A thousand lamps on flunkeys gleam ;
Some soft ghost, flutteringly white,
Beside the sliprails seems to dream.
With silken flank the ample cow
Is lolling in the meadows deep;
The king unfurrows half his brow
And puts his greatness by to keep;
The fair Evangeline, I trow,
Has been a blushing hour asleep.
(Before I close I, must explain,
To make it clear just what I mean:
A golden day in rhyme is slain
In terms of purple, pink and green,
But weary morn shall wake again,
Cow, king and young Evangeline.)

CURSE O’ MOSES.
Everyman.
I am Adam and I am Cain,
I’m of the old, old men;
And I am the Son of the new made man,
And the son of him again.
I am the hate of the ruthless man,
I am fear in the young child’s eye;
I am the splendid heart of him
Who smiles when he falls to die.
I am the maiden whose soul of love
Floats heaven and earth between;
And mine is the blood of the buccaneer.
The shame of the Magdalene.
I am the bird in the snarer’s net,
The hawk on the mountain peak; ■
The August bud, and the Autumn pod, *
And the mystery that you seek.
On me are the chains of the galley slave, i
Who perished long, long ago;
I fell with Nelson, with Caesar fared,
I am Michael Angelo.
Mine are the savage lips that yelled
When the long hot spear tore flesh,
And up in the church in the hills away
I fight my wars afresh.
I am Abel and Ham and Saul,
I wail with the damned and lost;
[’m up in the heaven of high St. John,
In eternal Pentecost.
I am one with Satan, and one with Christ,
My soul is the soul of all;
The shuttle of ages has made the robes
That over my shoulders fall.
For grey old Ti|g.e, with needle and bowl,
And armed with blessing and curse,
Hath charged my veins, ay, drop by drop
With the blood of the universe.

So I am Adam, and I am you,
And the moods of every man;
I am the product of Chance or Fate.
The chaos and the plan.
I am ruler, and I am ruled,
I thrill to the whole world’s cry;
I love the robber, I love the robbed,
And I hail whate’er comes by.
From out my flesh, and my jealous soul,
I east you both small and great,
For I am you, and you are I,

With Flowers.
Through the gay city when the noon was sped,
Moved the long, dark procession of the Dead,
Rebuking life with sad and solemn pace ,
It went slow-footed to the burial-place, 'j
With arching necks, plumed heads in grave array,
Four coal-black steedsjin pairs did lead the way.
Silver and cedar, polished mirror-wise,
Hid the still figure from my watching eyes. .
Heaped flowers were round it, sweetening the air
With scent of violets and roses rare.
Upon the hearse were lilies tall and pale,
All velvet-mouth’d and tremulously frail.
I said: “Some Lilith, pure as Winter’s snows,;
Horiored and loved, to her lone burial goes.
“Some maid, perchance, perchance some noble* wife
Who lived a gracious, richly life.” t
“Good riddance !” said a voice beside me theri—
“To yon gross hawk that ate the hearts of men.
“He robbed and grasped, and plundered alii his
hours. i *
And now..-. God laughs! they bury him with
flowers.”

How to Address Letters.
Conespondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
papa (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/’ is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE WHITE MAN STARTS FOR
HOME.
One or two belated Tories —notably Dr.
Creed, of the Cornstalk Upper House —have
lately spoken a sort of Last Hopeless Howl
in the cause of nigger labor for the Northern
Territory, and recited a final lament to the
effect that “the white man can’t work in the
tropics.” Nobody seems to have lent an ear
of any importance to this ultimate cry, and
when it was uttered the eye of faith had an
urgent appointment elsewhere. On the other
side of the case, a number of Federal Labor-
ites and Liberals, returning from a visit to
the Lost Province, speak of it kindly, but
with an air of patronage and apology that
is quite uncalled for. They say—practically
every man who has been there —that it is
a great, rich country, with vast possibilities,
and -that the white man who leads a sen-
sible, temperate life can live and work
in it without difficulty. In this state-
ment of the case they are backed up
by every habitual inhabitant of the North
who has given his opinions to the press.
But, after all, even these Laborites and Lib-
erals appear, to some extent, to miss the
point. They have heard, over and over
again, the stereotyped and platitudinous lie
that the white man is naturally the child of
cold regions, and the calamitous old yarn
has soaked in. So they start: witli the as-
sumption that when the white man goes
into the tropics—not only when he goes
into a region like India, to be a sort of boss
loafer amid insanitary niggers, and unpleas-
ant nigger diseases, and unclean nigger
cities, but even when lie goes into a clean
tropical country to lead the healthy life of
the worker—he is departing from * the na-
tural order of things. They fancy that he
wilt require special treatment and a very
special course _of acclimatisation. They
imagine that his conduct calls in some mea-
sure for defence and explanation. Yet, it is
much more logical to assume that he is an
exile sroing home to his natural environment
that he is a person who, after a brief and
compulsory spell amid alien snows and ex-
traneous frosts, is returning to the sunshine
that is his by right.
* * * *
The argument with which the Tory
always starts the case for colored labor in
the North is that Providence, at the very
beginning of things, when Chaos was still a
hoy, put the white man in cold countries
and the colored man in warm countries, and
that Providence presumably knew its busi-
ness. This obvious lie has been told so often
that most people accept it as gospel, which
shows the effect of frequent repetition on the
uninquiring mind. As a matter of fact,
Irovidence did nothing so foolish. If it
did commit itself at all it was rather
in the opposite direction. Providence was
never the ass that many allegedly pious
people seem to imagine, nor did it ever go
braying and eating thistles among the stars
in the manner alleged. When we look back
as far as the glimmer of history will allow,
we find that there were, as there are now,
*° ur distinctive cool, or cold, regions south
ot the line. In Maoriland there was a
brown race. In Tasmania and the cooler
sections of Australia there was a pitch black
race, and even the gigantic snowdrifts of the
Gippsland mountains didn’t bleach this race
worth a cent. In the cool regions of South
Africa there was a race the color of an ink
blot. In the bitter cold of the tip of South
America there was a dark reddish race. On
the other side of the line a very dark red-
dish or brownish race filled the cold regions
of North America right up to the home of
the glaciers and the appalling frosts of
Alaska. And a yellow race occupied the bit-
terly cold wastes and wildernesses of north-
ern Asia and the north-east —the coldest
section—of Europe. As for the white man,
he . seems to have been a comparatively
limited circumstance at the beginnings of
known history, though he was one day
to hold the fate of the world in
his hands. He appears to have oecu-
pied, in a scattered sort of fashion, the
milder regions of Middle Europe, but to
have had his principal strongholds in the
warm regions round the Mediterranean. A
race with brown hair and blue eyes spread
right down as far as the southern boundary
ot the Great African desert. Even to this
day a white race occupies the desert, and the
men with blue eyes and brown hair still
hold their own, and anything else they can
steal, amid the Atlas Mountains. The 'white
man held Lower Egypt. The white Hebrew
was_ not yet due in Palestine, but he was
coming, and from his country was to come
the wonderful legend of the White Christ.
The white Phoenician and the white Persian
were just developing. The white Greek and
the white Roman were among the world’s
possibilities. Owing to the fact that the
century which ended yesterday looks longer
than the thousand or two thousand years
which ended very long ago, it is difficult to
realise that all save a scrap of the white
mans history is the history of white men
who lived in warm climates—climates more
or less resembling the Northern Territory.
Also, it is not easy to realise that the white
man, as a dweller in cold climates, is still in
the experimental stage.
* * * *
The ill-luck that ultimately came upon the
white man of the warm regions was the re-
sult of his situation. The reason why the
black Ethiopian fell on Egypt instead of Eng-
land was that one was accessible and the
other was not. The Arabs and other hor-
rors rushed Phoenicia and Northern Africa
in the full flush of their strength because
these places were more adjacent than Ger-
many or Denmark. The Greek became a
mongrel, and the, once all-conquering Italian
a half-bred failure, and the Spaniard a sort
of Christianised Arab, and the Portuguese a
kind of mulatto, and the Russian a semi-
Tartar because they had always to stand the
first shock of more or less colored in-
roads. The pure white man established
his headquarters in the colder sections
of his original empire because of com-
paratively recent invasion. But there is
no evidence that he was ever meant by na-
ture to belong to these sections any more than
the export of Nihilists to Siberia shows that
Nature specially fitted Siberia for the Nihi-
list constitution. Before his misfortunes,
commenced and he went into exile, so to
speak, his great cities, like Carthage and
Memphis and Damascus and Tyre and An-
tioch and Athens and Rome and Constanti-
nople and many more clung close by the mar-
gin of the warm water. He only built nlaees
like Edinburgh and Stockholm and St.
Petersburgh, or even places like London and
Paris and Berlin, when he was to a
great extent hunted out of his pre-
vious habitations. There were barbar-
ous white men in the North —what mis-
fortune had chased them into regions which
Providence apparently intended for the
Mongol and the Red Indian no one knows —
at a very early date, but even then they
were plainly dissatisfied with their environ-
ment. Some of the earliest troubles of
Ronie arose out of the fixed desire of these
white men to get further south and get com-
fortably warm, and the earliest known
troubles of Carthage arose out of the desire
of the white Roman to get further south
also. And in much later years the dissatis-
faction of white races with their cold cli-
mates kept Europe in a turmoil. It brought
the Norseman to Ireland and Normandy and
Sicily and many other places, and it led other
peoples to regions where they were wholly
unwelcome. The white man of a good few
centuries ago discovered that he wasn’t
strong ■ enough to reclaim his heritage in
Western Asia and Northern Africa, so for
the time he put up with his narrow quarters
as best he could. But he never took kindly
to them, and the struggles of the people in
the colder regions to climb on top of the
people in the warmer ones were very ener-
getic. The people .of the warmer regions
often came off none too well in these dis-
agreements. having their hands full of
trouble with the colored neighbors who came
at them out of Asia. The Northman, when
he started south, had no live enemies in his
rear except whales. The Greek, with the
Northman &n one hand and the Saracen on
the other, was a man of many annoyances.
Where the real white man had a run for
his money—excluding, that is, such places as
the Turkey of to-day, where tne religious and
racial quarrels of mixed peoples make even
040 acres of Paradise of little value—he
seems to have had doubts, right from the be-
ginning of things, about his special suit-
ability for cold climates. He may not have
known that he had doubts, but he had them
all the same. His colonisation of Greenland
was admittedly a failure, and that of Ice-
land wasn’t much better. Norway and Swe-
den are two of the best governed countries
rni ur °P e —and the most thinly peopled.
Ihe northern section of Russia is even a
more complete blank. The British Isles are
thickly peopled in the aggregate, and the
population is increasing in the aggregate,
but the cold bracing north is steadily losing
its inhabitants. The white man put up with
it and dwelt there in his kilts when he didn’t
know of any other place to go to and had no
money to go with, but now that he can get
away he is leaving. Canada and the United
States are dubious problems. They had so
many advantages to otter in the way of
cheap or free land, gold, coal, iron, free and
easy government, light taxes, absence of re-
ligious troubles and revolutions, and com-
parative freedom from racial difficulties,
that the white man has put up with their
climatic disadvantages. Still, he has so
far expressed his views on the subject that
the population of the warmer United States
is about o() per square mile, and that of the
colder Canada about two. Also, population
is already beginning to backwash from the
Canadian north-west. It has been tried and
has failed.
When the Englishman first began to rush
Australia, the gold discoveries—not the cli-
mate-decided that the great bulk of the
early settlement would be in the south. Yet
even in going to the south the newcomer was
supposed then to be committing a rather
wild experiment. The man from Edinburgh
or Condon who went to Adelaide or Sydney
sweltered and fainted in a summer tempera-
ture from nine to 12 degrees higher than he
was accustomed to, and in Brisbane the rise
was as high as 1G or 17 degrees. At least
he was supposed to faint and swelter, but he
didn t. He lost his allegedly bracing winter,
which braces so many people into the grave.
But even that did him no visible harm. He
went to inland places with higher heat records
than the coastal cities, and things, persistedt-
ly went well with him. He pitched his tent
further and further up the coast, till he got
as far north as he could go—further north
than even the most northern part of the Ter-
ritory—-and the results, after several genera-
i,ns are even more remark-
able. Ihe death-rate of the white man in
Queensland—the one State of Australia
which is mostly tropical, and the one notable
example which the world possesses of almost
purely white _ settlemenf on a large scale in
the tropics is about 40 per cent, below that
°f. Weak and unwholesome England, and
still further below that of hyperborean Scot-
land—a locality quite unfit for any white
man s occupation. It is below the rate of
Australia in general, and in many years it
is very notably below the rate of the com-
paratively cold island of Tasmania. The
birth-rate is above the Australian average
and above the British average; and the
population increases by excess of births over
deaths nearly twice as fast as it does in
England. A great many strange narratives
are told about the unfitness of the climate
uMj WOmen and children, but women and
children survive to an extent unknown in
the inhospitable land from which their an-
cestors came. It is also said (hat in many
cases the women lose their h°autv earlv.
Against that it may be truly alleged that, in
the colder parts of Europe, very few of them
have any beauty to lose, early or otherwise.
The great aggregate unloveliness of the
women and girls in the bleaker regions of
Europe is a standing evidence of the unfit-
ness of the environment for the daughters of
the white neonle. It is onU in the warmer
regions of Europe that comeliness becomes a
habit.
* * * *
All the evidence tends to show (hat when
the white man gets to a tropical or semi-
tropical rbgion, which can be reserved for-
purely ivhite settlement, he is simply going
home. He is returning from the unnatural
exile to which the bulk of his race
was driven by political complications a,
while since—not long since as the age of
this old globe goes. Australia is the onlv
mace in the world where a white man with
intelligence, and a steamboat or railway fare
in his pocket, can take his choice of living
in the tropics or in a land of heavy winter
snows, without leaving his own country, or
his own people, or his own Government.
And, the choice being thus open to him it
's worth noting that the coldest of the
States is the most consistent exporter of
population, and the second coldest is the
second insistent evnorfer. while the
pleasant North is a consistent gainer these
day®. To nr*- the matter shortly, there is
no Northern Territory problem at all, exceot
in the imaginations of liars, bigots nod fools
Tffiere was once the problem of Northern
Australia m general, hut the experience of
GueensUnd has already furnished the an-
swer. Said answer is that the white man
'"ants to go there. He would rather be
there (so soon as he learns the real merits
of the place) than in the cold countries he
came from. And the extent of his rush there
—assuming (hat he knows.of the place, and
has been able to scrape up the fare, and
hasn’t physically degenerated in tb° hyper-
borean regions of his fathers to such an ex-
tent that he ha® become a prohibited immi-
grant—is only limited by the action of tlm
Government in providing land, railways and
the other essentials of settlement.

ANOTHER CONVERSION IMMINENT.
On all the available evidence Liberalism is
preparing- for a change of front, or complete
somersault, in regard to the Referenda
questions which the Australian Government
is pledged to re-submit to the electors —a
change comparable to the neat handspring
which a vast majority .of the party has
already executed on the naval defence issue.
TT ere. for example, is what W. H. Irvine,
M.H.R., is reported by Melbourne Age to
have said to the Australian Women’s Na-
tional League last week :
lie believed that it would be necessary that the
restrictions placed in the Constitution on the power
of the Federal Parliament to control trade and com-
merce would, for many reasons, soon have to be re-
moved. Some of the most important issues with
which the people would have to deal in the imme-
diate future were issues that were only capable of
being dealt with by a Parliament that had the
authority to speak for the • whole of Australia...
There must be legislative regulation of monopolies
and combinations of capitalists to deal with the in-
jurious use of their powers. Sooner or later they
must be prepared to vest in the National Parliament
the powers that were necessary to achieve great
national objects. . .With regard to the power of in-
dustrial control, greater difficulties arose. lie had no
hesitation in saying that ultimately the control of
industrial relations must rest with the Parliament
which controlled the policy of Australia.
It doesn’t leave much of the allegedly
pestiferous proposals of April, 1910, for the
champions of Liberalism to oppose. The
main objection, the vear before to the
Fisher Government’s, ambition to “remove
the restrictions placed in the Constitution
on the power of the Australian Parliament
to control trade and commerce” was that
the Australian Parliament if given this
power (a power, by the way, which the
House of Commons has held for centuries)
might misuse it in an insane and malignant
fashion. It was seriously represented by
responsible politicians and newspapers that,
if the trade and commerce clause in the
Australian Constitution were deleted or
amended in such a way as to validate the
New Protection, etc., the Government would
go quite mad and nationalise everything.
One representative of a Sydney constitu-
ency “took his hearers’ breaths away,” as
Sydney Telegraph admiringly put it, by
citing 122 (or it might have been 1022) in-
dustries that would be liable to be seized by
the Government under tne proposed new
order of things. An anti-Refetfendum
argument which was exploi.ed with
damnable iteration in those days re-
posed broad-based on the theory that
if the Australian Parliament were given
full power to control the trade and com-
merce of Australia every successful fruit
and sweet shop in the land would be social-
ised, nor would Private Enterprise be left
the handling of so much as one soundly
established rabbit-vending or bottle-adcumu-
lating concern. Ily the present look of
things these time-hallowed old yarns or men-
dacities are due for burial.
And so with the Fisher Government’s
proposals concerning Federal control of
monopolies. “There must be legislative re-
gulation of monopolies,” cries the voice of
Liberalism to-day. Less than three years
ago the same voice might have been heard
confidently asserting that there were no
monopolies in Australia, and that any sug-
gestion to the contrary amounted to sheer
demagogish cant. Where Liberalism didn’t
starkly deny the existence of vends or com-
bines it took the point that the few which
did obtain were altruistic concerns whose
continuance was, more or less, vital to the
prosperity of Australia. And, finally, it
was claimed that the proposal to give the
Federal Parliament control over monopolies,
benevolent or otherwise, was utterly super-
fluous, anyhow, since the different States
were in a position, under their Constitu-
tions, to protect themselves from inequit-
able treatment. It would seem that in the
opinion of at least one of
soundest lawyers all these old-timm rallying-
lies are due for the ash-heap ; which should
make the task of the National Party a good
deal lighter.
As regards the Common Rule question, the
Victorian Iv.C.’s pronouncement that “ulti-
mately the control of industrial relations
must rest with Parliament” is not likely to
arouse, wild surprise anywhere. Some of
Australia’s _ staunchest Tories jtaken
the same view from the moment practically
that the last Referendum t was
started. Speaking in N. S. Wales in March,
1911, ex-Minister Garland, K.C., observed:
The second requirement of the Federal Gove'riiment,
as stated by Mr. Hughes, was “power over indus-
trial legislation to cover those matters only par-
tially covered or altogether neglected by State legis-
lation. ’ In so far as giving the Federal Arbitration
Court power to make a Common Rule y here again he
was solid behind Mr. Hughes ; it was only an act of
justice.
This speaker was also in favor of the Fisher
Government’s New Protection policy. If this is
the attitude of the Freetrade variety of
Fusion supporter there is small likelihood
of a quarrel _ on the New Protection score
with the Tariffists of the Party. As a mat-
ter of fact the New Protection policy was
Opposition leader Deakin’s original politi-
cal property.
It is evident from the above that some of
Liberalism’s best legal brains are prepared
to swallow so much of the Government’s
Referendum programme that'the residue will
be hardly discernible to the naked eye. A
particularly cheering aspect of the position
is Irvine’s change of heart in the matter of
the trade and commerce clause. It is a
whole menagerie of lions in the path of pro-
gress. It killed the well-intentioned Excise
Act which imposed on looally-menufactur°d
goods an excise duty remittable on the
manufacturer showing that he had paid his
employees fair wages. (The High Court
decided in Rex v. Barger that this Act
“was bad because it infringed upon the im-
plied prohibition in the Constitution against
interference with the internal trade and
commerce of the States.”) It also killed
{vide Appleton’s case) what W. H. Ir*
vine terms “legislative regulation of mono-
polies.” In brief, speaking generally, it has
slain pretty well all “the powers that are
necessary if the National Parliament is to
achieve great national objects.’’ The pro-
bability of such measures as the New Pro-
tection, a Federal Common Rule and Com-
monwealth Control of Monopolies being
effectuated will, of course, elicit the custom-
ary shouts of annoyance from the chronic
irreconcilables who fight every projected re-
form to the last ditch, on principle. Foolish
and mostly illiterate old Liberals—the local
prototypes of the “wild” or “backwoods”
politicians of Britain —will dash agitatedly
around, as heretofore, proclaiming irration-
ally that such changes mean spoliation and
anarchy, and threatening to foment a revo-
lution if they are accomplished. But with
the intellectual leaders of their party
against them they should not carry much
weight. In fact, there will be something
rotten in the- mental condition of the coun-
try if they carry any weight at all.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Oracle from Central America.
Among the members- of the Federal party
which recently visited the Northern Terri-
tory the one conspicuously discordant voice
—the one voice loudly raised in the nigger
labor interest —was that of Pearse, of the
Pastoralists’ Review, and the Pastoral-
ists’ Review might possibly have been much
disappointed in its Pearse if he had lifted
his voice otherwise. Said he, among other
things, according to a Sydney paper report
(the remarks in brackets are not his, but
are mere directions to the printer) :
The visit had been paid at the best time of the
/ear. Let them go up during the hot months
then they Will find out I [very large “I,” please]
have been in the West Indies, Central America and
Mexico, where I [exceedingly large “I,” if the
printer will be so kind] lived for a number of years.
I [immense “I,” or the printer will lose his job]
have never known a white man capable of doing the
hard work required. . . .It is lowering the standard of
the whites to put them in a tropical country and ask
them to do a black man's work.
And apparently it never occurred to this
notable “I” individual, with his wide
knowledge of countries quite unlike the Ter-
ritory—countries with a dense colored popu-
lation —that all his inferences drawn from
Central America and the West Indies are
wholly' irrelevant and superfluous. The tro-
pical region which is almost exactly like the
Territory in climate and conditions —the
one which proves or disproves the case —
isn’t in Guatemala or Honduras or Jamaica.
It is right alongside, in Queensland. And
Queensland badly wrecks Pearse’s theories.
There is something superb about the idea of
any sheep-and-cow-newspaper person from
Central America delivering lectures on tropi-
cal settlement to the only race which has
atterflpted to establish a purely white com-
munity on a large scale in the tropics—and
has succeeded. If people go up north dur-
ing the hot months, Pearse reckons, “they
will find out.” It sets one wondering where
he thinks the average North Queensland r
lives during the hot months. Then Pearse
had another reason to adduce in favor of
nigger labor in the Territory : —•
They must have all the rough work clone by tropi-
cal labor, and indentured labor at that. There are
two reasons for this. First of all, when the rainy
season is on in the Territory, the flush of weeds is
terrific, and every man I spoke to up there said
that it was beyond the capacity of the white man
to keep them down.
Curiously enough, among all the visitors to
the Territory, and there have been dozens
of them, who have given their opinions to
the press, Pearse appears to be the only
one who has heard about this weed diffi-
culty. It would be a shocking thing to sus-
pect that he invented it; possibly he was
simply more observant than other visi-
tors and inhabitants. Still, he doesn’t ex-
plain why white men can’t keep down
weeds as well as niggers. And despite the
lack both of white men and niggers the
weeds haven’t grown up and suffocated the
Territory, even after millions of years of
sun and rain. Also, when Pearse, of the
sheep-and-cow publicalion, talks in this
fashion he is apt to create an impression
that the rainfall of the Territory is some-
thing special and incredible—which is quite
wrong. A bit of the Territory has under
lOin. of rain per annum —about the same as
Broken Hill (N.S.W.). A big, elevated and
fairly cool section has between lOin. and
20in. the same as, say, Condobolin
(N.S.W.). There is a 20in. section which
answers to Mudgee or Singleton (N.S.W.)
or Ballarat (Vic.). The dampest corner
registers 40in. to 60in. a year. Now around
Geraldton (re-christened Innisfail) in tro-
pical North Queensland there is a patch of
country where the rainfall reaches as high
as 130 in. per annum, yet even there the
white man lives, and makes money, and
keeps his head above the weeds. Also, there
is a section of Tasmania with a lOOin. rain-
fall. Therefore the new and weedy reason
why the white man can’t inhabit the Terri-
tory calls for more explanation than Mr.
Pearse has given it. An aspect of the
question which hasn’t been touched on is
that many Fatmen are said to be so anxious
to get some kind of labor that won’t have a
vote or a voice in the control of the State,
that they are willing to fill the country with
any kind of nigger, however dreadful, and to
do any kind of misrepresentation, however
clumsy and outrageous, in order to get the
nigger. Perhaps some of these have been
talking to Pearse, and have misled him.

Manifold’s are Thy Mercies, O Lord.
Victoria, it seems, is making great Liberal
strides towards the rescue of the Common-
wealth from Labor’s “blighting tyranny”
(the words are those of Willie Watt). A
recent issue of Melbourne Argus led off
with gladsome tidings of great joy:—
It is very satisfactory to find that Mr. Chester
Manifold has consented to stand as the Liberal
candidate for Corangarnite. Mr. Manifold was the
first member for the electorate in the Federal Parlia-
ment, but he retired because of the pressing duties
imposed upon him by the management of his pro-
perty. Now that he is once more in the field Liberal
electors have every reason to anticipate victory. . .It
is a ridiculous and discreditable anomaly that such
a constituency should be represented by a Socialist.
There is a call and an opportunity for other men of
the standing and calibre of Mr. Manifold to redeem
the constituencies of Wannon, Indi, Corio and
Gippsland from the misrepresentation which they
have suffered since last general election.
With a Manifold in the van the march of
Liberalism should be irresistible. “Charge !
Chester, charge!” will be his battle cry
when the trumpets sound, and his tenants
may possibly remark that he has done it
already. The Manifold family owns so
much of the earth in Victoria that the first
member for Corangarnite had to retire from
Parliament, in order to devote his Liberal
patriotism to the management of his vast
estates, and then his old constituency took
a preposterous fancy to be represented by
an. advocate of land taxation and everything
else that no Manifold could possibly ap-
prove of. The gallant Chester had to squat
and bear it as best he could —in fact, he is
still squatting and bearing it—but at last
he sees his way clear to fight for his country
in general, and bis own lump of it in particu-
lar, as a Liberal politician. If the example
of this self-sacrificing member of a proud
squat'ocracy inspires other large landed
proprietors to arise and stand for other
constituencies, that are now suffering from
misrepresentation and blight, the cause of
Liberalism will be greatly advanced, or
ruined or something.

Sea Defence in a Serious Spirit.
Maoriland has been seized with another of
those spasms of purely British “loyalty” to
which it is so much addicted. Amid a con-
siderable blaze of glory, and with a rush of
fireworks to the head, it has agreed that its
one lonesome warship shall be permanently
stationed in British waters. This craft, in-
deed, can hardly even be called Maoriland’s
one lonesome ship, for that country pre-
sented it to J. Bull in the first instance,
and the original bargain was that it was to
be attached to the Bull fleet on the China
station. Maoriland has, roughly speaking,
one-fortieth of the population of the British
Isles, and if it proposed to carry a propor-
tionate share of naval defence it should, in
a perfectly unostentatious way, maintain
about a dozen good vessels, and replace them
steadily as they become obsolete; also, it
should supply its fair proportion of ship-
yards, of shipbuilding capacity, of capable
seamen and officers, and of naval ability
and resources generally. The presentation
to the British Government of one ship built
in England represented the maximum of
fuss and advertisement with the minimum
of achievement. It didn’t make Maoriland
more serviceable to the empire in a fighting
sense, and it heaped upon Bull an unpleas-
ant load of gratitude. When Maoriland
nobly cast its naval contribution into the com-
mon stock it thereby implied in the most dis-
tinct fashion that it expected to be defended
out of the common stock. Whereby Bull
received a small present, and was invited to
carry a huge responsibility, coupled with a
sort of obligation to whoop something extra
about the benefits he had received and to
throw a title or two around in addition. It
was, on the whole, a rather lop-sided bar-
gain. Still, if Maoriland had agreed to join
Australia in a scheme of combined local sea-
defence there would have been a lack of the
furore and the advt. and the decorations,
and these things have to be Considered. The
matter would have been mere plain business.
Ward’s islands apparently don’t take sea
defence seriously. Probably they reckon
that Australia lies so much closer to the
point of danger that it will keep the assail-
ant busy for a while, and in the meantime
Maoriland will have time to cry out to Bull
for assistance. Australia is not at all likely
to follow Maoriland’s example in this mat-
ter. It wants all its small vessels right
here, to patrol its northern coast and prevent
the altogether too handy Asiatic smuggling
himself and his opium into the country. It
knows that because of its situation it, and
not Maoriland, is likely to be rushed by a
surprise attack the first time Britain is in
serious trouble in Europe, and it wants to
have at least some semblance of defence on
the spot. Then, again, because of its situa-
tion, and also because of its great empty
spaces, it is, much more than Maoriland, the-
goal of the Chow and Jap immigrant. When
Japan demands free admission for its people
to Australia, Britain, which is a nigger-loving
place because the nigger is afar off, may be
half-disposed to assent, and .then it will
much better that such ships as we have are'
definitely on the White Australia side. If
they were presented to Britain White Aus-
tralia might find its own vessels serving in
T the Black Australia interest. One way and
another Australia has to take its naval de-
fence seriously, and can’t afford to regard
its few vessels as a mere device wi'h which
to buy glory and titles for people of local im-
portance.
A Glance at Liberalism in the Making.
Tiie extreme Tories, or, as they humorously
term themselves, the Liberals of Australia,
have adhered doggedly to one routine prac-
tice for as long as ihe memory of man reaches
back. It has been their invariable custom,
in regard to all progressive legislation, to
begin by damning the innovation, lock, stock
and barrel; to pass from furious assault to a
sort of sulky acquiescence ; and so, by gentle
gradations, to a stage where they blandly
claim the reform as their own. For ex-
ample, Federal Old Age Pensions. When
Austin Chapman, M.P), started to push
this measure, about 10 years ago, he was
politically anathema to Liberalism as repre-
sented by G. H. Reid, J. Cook, the S. M.
Herald and the Melbourne Argus. This
combination reprobated Chapman’s proposal
as unalloyed Socialism; which, of course, it
was. Yet, last week, we had the bizarre
spectacle of Kelly, M.P., announcing, at
Goulburn (N.S.W.), that Liberalism was re-
sponsible for Old Age Pensions. Ten years
ago there were not enough reproaches in all
the lexicon of Liberalism to express the folly
of Arbitration Courts. To-day, the credit
for Arbitration and Conciliation legislation
is widely claimed, both in the Common-
wealth and in the States, by Liberalism. And
now, seemingly, the essentially Laborite
policy of Australian Defence is to be
adopted. At a political meeting in Mel-
bourne, last week, a Mrs. Morton, in the
course of an address in which she called
upon her hearers to “get up with her on to
the mountain top, and take a broad outlook
from a national standpoint,” said: —
The present Government, in regard to immigra-
tion and defence, stood utterly condemned. It was
true it had done something for defence - -
Mr. Robert Best: In carrying out the policy of
the previous Government. (Applause.)
A day or so later W. 11. Kelly, M.P., deal-
ing with Senator Pearce’s reasonable claim,
that the Laborites were responsible for Aus-
tralia’s Defence system, such as it is, said:
I do not know which I admire most about that,
its innocence or audacity—(applause)—Senator
Pearce's innocence in supposing that the electors
could so soon have forgotten, br his audacity in
thinking it could remain uncontradicted for any
time.
Coming from a politician who, till a couple
of months ago, held blatantly (1) that the
only sound way to defend Australia was to
strengthen Britain’s North Sea Fleet, and
(2) that a local navy could never be an ade-
quate substitute for a subsidised squadron of
British ships, the above may be described as
a fairly good sample of nerve, not to say
hide. Liberalism’s position on the Defence
question is painfully clear. Two years ago
the leader of the Federal Opposition or Lib-
eral party, in the Australian Parliament, was
Joseph Cook. Here is the party’s policy, as
stated bv Cook in Sydney Town Hall
(26/3/’10)
Their duty was to offer a Dreadnought—(cheers)
—and to give a greater naval subsidy to the old
country year by year. They were hearing much
about “nailing their colors to the mast” ; well, he
nailed his flag, there and now, to an increased sub-
sidy. (Loud and prolonged cheering.)
The citizen who scouted this view, the year
before last, was regarded by Liberalism either
as a traitor or a fool. Thus Sydney Tele-
graph remarked (29/3/TO) :
Apparently there are still some people in this
country who have failed to grasp the real issue in-
volved in the present conflict of opinion with regard
to the naval situation in this country. That issue is,
briefly, whether the Commonwealth shall render sub-
stantial assistance to the cause of British sea suprem-
acy, or whether it shall epneentrate its resources on
an attempt to build up an Australian navy. If it
can be shown— as it can be conclusively that there
is no possibility of Australia being able to con-
struct and man an Australian navy strong enough to
resist even the weakest of the navies of the
Powers, the issue would appear to be settled for all
reasonable minds.
As a matter of fact, papers like the Tele-
graph, and most Liberals, still proudly
stand, as regards naval defence, where they
did two years ago. They aren’t due to take
a favorable view of compulsory military
training or of the local navy idea for bait a
dozen years at least; and they will probably
be surprised and extremely exasperated \o

untimely conversion.

The Howling Hosts of Belfast.
Though Irish Home Rule is a long distance
away from Australia it is still a subject of
general interest, and the howl of Ulster—
or the howl which professes to be the howl
of Ulster —has attracted attention here as
any other loud and unusual noise might do.
Therefore it is worth while to inspect the
disturbance and to draw attention to the
fact that the opinion of the man in the
street is likely to be as far wrong on this
subject as it is on so many others. . As a
rule the man In the street believes in (he
loudest row, and pins his unquestioning
faith to the statement he hears oftenest.
That is why he is never anything more than
the man in the street. The shouting of cer-
tain individuals who profess to be, in their
own persons, the angry and disloyal pro-
vince of Ulster has gone up to the blue em-
pyrsean until it has become a matter of com-
mon belief that the place is a Protestant
and anti-Plome-Rule province, which is
going to shed its blood like bilge water in
the cause of Unionism, unless its’ patriots
are put in gaol before the campaign begins.
No impression could' be more erroneous.
Ulster consists of nine counties and returns
33 members to the House of Commons. Of
these members 17 are Tory or Unionist, and
16 ire Home Rulers. There are three
borough constituencies. Belfast has four
members, one of whom is a Home Ruler.
Londonderry, where the Flames of Smith-
field come from, has one member, a Tory
who scraped in by 105 majority over a
Home Ruler in a poll of 4725. Newry has
one member, a Home Ruler. Among the
county districts some of the Unionist mem-
bers hold their seats by rather shaky ma-
jorities. Gordon, the Unionist person- -of
North Londonderry, scrambled in by 333
majority in a poll of 7357 ; 'and Feather-
stonhaugh, at Fermanagh, had 347 votes
to the good in a poll of 4457. These are the
figures of the latest election. But for the
fact that the proportion of persons qualified
to vote is smaller in Ireland than- in Eng-
land or Scotland, it is quite probable that
Ulster would return a solid Home Rule
majority. In Ulster Protestants are in a
small majority when all the' sects are added
together, but if the three great sects, Roman
Catholics, Anglicans and Presbyterians, are
taken separately, then the Iloman Catholics
stand first. The great point in favor of the
Unionists is that they are in a majority in
the biggest town, and thus control the big-
gest newspaper. But “Protestant Ulster”
and “Unionist Ulster” are equally-a fraud
based on effrontery, hard lying and vocifera-
tion. The Unionist push only manages to
show the barest majority in Ireland’s north-
ern province nowadays, and the narrow
franchise is largely responsible for even
that. The claim of that almost impercep-
tible majority in a province which stands
for one-fourth of Ireland to run the whole
country is interesting mainly to collectors
of dried perjury and stuffed bumptiousness.
Still, in a world where the brass drum is the
loudest instrument and the cry of the howler
monkey can drown the remarks of every
other living creature, it is worth while to
note how the delusion of “Protestant Ul-
ster” and “Unionist Ulster” has been im-
posed upon a great section of the English-
speaking race. The threatened insurrection
of the Irish North against Home Rule is
almost certainly a jest. At the first sign of
the embattled hosts of Belfast lumbering
into the field half their own province would
throw clods and potatoes at them.
Liberalism for the Ladies.
At St. Kilda (Melbourne) Town Hall, a
few days ago, a large gathering of nicely-
dressed women listened approvingly to the
“Liberal” reflections of W. H. Irvine and
others on the reckless expenditure of the
Labor Ministry. Irvine, who is not so
much an iceberg as a cold douche, rained
much criticism on the awful scandal of Old
Age Pensions. Said that earnest, gentle-
manly “Liberal”: —
He would regard it as a national calamity if the
principle of providing for the aged destitute by
gratuitous doles from the public treasury of Aus-
tralia were to be made a permanent part of our
policy. (Applause.) He was not affected in the
least by the knowledge that the principle had rc-
recently been adopted in Great Britain. (Painful
silence.) If public money were to be provided for
old age, why not also for invalidism and unemploy-
ment? It would be better for the people to make
up their minds to provide for those already entitled
to the pension, and those who would shortly qualify
for it, and at the same time endeavor to arrive at
some really sensible scheme, based on the principle
of contribution and co-operation.
Irvine, in short, is in favor of the principle
of National Insurance Societies, run by a
paternal Commonwealth. He would have
all workers sufficiently waged to be able to
contribute insurance premiums whilst they
are in employment, thereby entitling them-
selves to relief whilst they are temporarily
unemployed, or permanently disabled. He
thinks:—
it should be possible for the Government to help
in building up co-operative bodies so that they
would be able to take up the work of relieving their
members.
Which is not to say that what Irvine would
have the Federal - Government help to do
couldn’t be better done by the Government
entirely on its own. Liberalism, it seems,
cannot bewail the sinful extravagance of the
Labor Ministry in raising the expenditure
on old age pensions to £2,000,000 per an-
num without admitting that the growing in-
crease is justifiable at present, and will con-
tinue to be justifiable until the Government
substitutes a system of national insurance.
Liberalism professes to look forward to a
time when every worn-out worker will be
his, or her, old age pensioner (though Ir-
vine, by the way, forgets to mention the
non-wage earning woman), but it protests
against any extension of Socialism by a
Labor Government. The nicely-dressed
ladies of St. Kilda must find the nath of
Liberalism difficult to follow, especially when
they are wearing high-heeled shoes. Also,
as battlers for the rights of their Sex, they
must wonder why they applauded Irvine for
denouncing the principle of old age pensions
when he had no alternative suggestion to
make for the benefit of aged women who
will not have been privileged to take part in
“some really sensible scheme, based on the
principle of co-operation and contribution.”
Liberalism for the Ladies is equally narrow
and slippery.
[Edmund Fisher, Bulletin Office, 369 Collins-
-1 street, Melbourne.]
Some day, it is to be hoped, a N.S.W.- Gov-
ernment will make time to consider the Ma
State’s rotten laws relating to companies.
A couple of years back a co. was formed in
Sydney to amalgamate three or four carry-
ing concerns, and shares in the tiling were
whooped up on the Exchange. Things soon
went wrong, however, and a week or more
ago the co. notified pressing creditors that a
receiver had arrived on the premises in the
interests of the debenture-holders. Appar-
ently these debenture-holders were the bank
which had given the co. an overdraft, and
had then protected itself by getting a mort-
gage over the whole outfit. How long the
debentures had been in existence isn’t men-
tioned, but the last balance-sheet was as
dumb as a fresh-boiled crayfish on the ques-
tion. And the fool law doesn’t mind. Any
old co. can issue debentures to any old bank
or other creditor, giving a first mortgage
over everything, and it needn’t mention the
circumstance to the other creditors or the
shareholders. The first they are liable to
know about it is when the directors step out
and they get the cold eye of the other party’s
bailiff turned upon them from the doorstep.

Federation of Labor has overlooked the

Worker, continues its lonely wail against

country, so that, if shooting has to be done
in defence of the lives of men and the lives
and honor of women the shooters will know
how to do it. The scheme, says the publica-

in order to keep the Federation going for
this purpose, amongst others, it blossoms
thusly:—
Would that we could make every Federation mem-

Making Her Womanly.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lieut-General Baden-Powell. who was simply at-
tired in a khaki suit, 8.-P. hat with ornamental
feathers, and all his war medals, said (Sydney Tele-
graph report) : “The girl guides, or aids, I have met
everywhere—in Prussia. Holland, America and Can-
ada. We try to make them womanly creatures. We
teach them not to show themselves off, but to go to
their destination by back ways. Their business is to
keep quiet, and not swagger. AVe have games for
them and teach them to row boats, but we are all
against them parading and all that sort of thing—-
it leads them on to suffragette lines and swank.”
We teach her to be humble and respectful
in her ways;
We urge her to obliterate herself from
human gaze;
We like to see her scurry when the public
heaves in sight,
And bolt for cover, bluslifully, with all her
main and might,
Remembering that swank and show and
military fuss
Are luxuries that appertain exclusively to
Us.
Her headgear must be drab in hue and
destitute of plumes;
(The Girl who wears a feathered hat far,
far too much presumes) ;
Her costume, to be seemly, must be faded,
old and worn ;
No stern rebukes are hurled, in fact, if it is
frayed and torn.
If striking dresses are required, or hats
bizarre and gay,
We men are competent to meet the order,
any day.
We strive to keep her leisure moments use-
fully employed.
We make her work in them —whereat she s
simply overjoyed;
Or else we foster in her heart a love of
manly sport
By teaching her to handle boats of ev ry
size and sort.
And as we sit, within these craft, and
watch her while she rows,
Her honest face with gratitude —or some-
thing—fairly glows.
We have not, so far, laid it down that Fe-
male Scouts shall wear
The Yashmak, or be gagged, or sacrifice
their flowing hair,
Or polish up our spurs and swords and
boots at close of day,
Or otherwise abase themselves —yet this is
not to say
That all these worthy customs of another
age and clime
May not be forced upon the lady-warrior
in time.

Dear Food—God Bless It.
The Werriwa (N.S.W.) Federal election
campaign raged along in an indefinite fashion
during its early stages. Liberalism was
short of ammunition. It lacked the courage
to say that, if returned to power, it would
abolish old age pensions, or wipe out the new
defence system, or sell the new warships, or
hand back the Northern Territory to S.A.,
or stop the Transcontinental railway. Nor
could it denounce the Fishek Government’s
borrowing policy, for it wanted to borrow
very much more than Fishek is doing; and
it couldn’t prove that Fisher’s Federal notes
are a failure; and it wasn’t game to heap
o kjurgation on the silly Yassberra capital;
and having put up an antiquated Freetrader
as its candidate it hadn’t a ghost of a
chance to denounce the insufficient character
cc th e Protection afforded by the present
tariff. So for quite a while it could do little
save chew soap in a general way, and make
the baseless semblance of a froth. But at
last, if the S. M. Herald is to be trusted,
something tangible has emerged. According
to that paper:—
Undoubtedly the point upon which the battle will
turn is the increased cost of living. The country is
reeling it just the same as the city, and the electors
are being harangued daily on the subject. As the
Liberals are largely using this live question to attack
with, they are probably gaining much more success
among those whose opinions are not of the fixed
order in favor of the Labor cause than the others
who are acting on the defensive, and there are many
such.
This is great news for Werriwa. In that
bushy locality rents have not gone up as in
the congested city, and the alleged “in-
creased cost of living” thereabouts is really
the alleged increased price of food. Labor,
it seems, has shoved food up, and Liberalism
is going to shove it down. Naturally, the
farmer, who sells, perhaps, 20 times, or 40
times, as much food as he uses, will rejoice
exceedingly to hear that he is to get a much
lower price for his goods, and when the news
soaks in he will probably fall on the Liberal
neck, and perhaps break it in several places.
It is a foolish party which preaches cheap
victual to a country with a great surplus of
u , for sale - That sort of doctrine
should be kept for a food-buying country.
Great Britain would gladly see the little bit
ot tood that it grows go down to half its
present value, if the very large quantity that
it imports would go down to correspond. It
™ ld then be about £100,000,000 a year
better off than it is now. But the countries
which supply the goods, and Australia is
°« e ’ T? uld . be that same *100,000,000 worse
olr. Consider the joy of the agriculturist
who, perhaps, sells material for 1000 loaves,
as compared with each loaf he uses, if the
j 6 i. b^ess t n S of Cheap Bread came along,
and he got the one loaf he uses Id. cheaper
(gain Id.), and had consequently to sell
material representing the other 1000 loaves
Id. per loaf cheaper also (loss £4 3s. 4d.).
It a barrister in a large way of practice
(Alfred Conroy is a barrister) was told
tha.t the price of law was going to be reduced
one-half, and that he ought to be glad, be-
cause, if his dog bit anybody and he ap-
peared for himself as defendant, he could
then charge himself only half as much as
before the reduction, and thus save himself
a lot of money—if such a barrister received
such a proposition, would he give way to
wild rejoicing, and build a bonfire, and'ring
the dinner-bell like thunder, and throw his
belltopper up three storeys high? Probably
not. The habitual buyer of law wants a
cheap article—not the habitual seller. It is
the same with the habitual buyers and sel-
lers of food, and Australia is the habitual
seller. In this country, times of cheap food
are always times of gloom and misery, and
so long as it is a food-exporting country
Australia wants no more of these times.
[James Edmond, Bulletin Office, 214 George-
street, Sydney.] s
“Shellback” makes a most reasonable pro-
position :
■ ,X er< fict N.S.W. Admiralty Judge Street
m the Nera-Taviuni ease, induces me to make a hail
on behalf of harassed sea captains and mates. Last
Eight Hour Day the Messageries Maritimes steamer
Nera was leaving, its wharf when the Union S.S.
Co. s Taviuni came into collision with it, and was
so damaged that it sank in half an hour. Each co.
sued for £70,000 as damages. But, first of all, the
Court of Marine Inquiry went into the causes of the
collision, and came to the conclusion that it was
brought about by the wrongful act or default of
Captain Beighton, master of the Maoriland-owned
boat, whose ticket was thereupon suspended for six
months. That time has elapsed, and now Justice
Street bursts upon the scene with his judgment that
the French mail steamer was wholly to blame for the
collision, and orders the M.M. Co. to pay damages as
assessed, and all costs. So that, according to the
Court of Marine Inquiry, Beighton is to blame, and,
according to the Admiralty Court, he isn’t. Which
is very interesting to everybody but Brighton. He
had 30 seconds to decide what he should do when he
turned a corner and met the Nera clawing round in
a narrow channel, and although the judicial tribunals
have had nearly as many weeks to think it out,
they haven’t been able to decide yet. Nevertheless,
the unfortunate skipper was severely punished. Now,
how about a fair deal? Either the Judge and
assessors of the Marine Court or the Judge in Ad-
miralty have made a prodigious error, and I move
that a committee of shellbacks be appointed to de-
cide which horsehair shall have its license cancelled,
its reputation crippled, and its pay stopped for six
months.

“0.K.” on the Bull situation:—
Britain’s diseased body politic is erupting again
in the same old place. The opposition of arrogant
Capital to unionism in Labor has now taken a
negative, rather than a positive form. At one of the
London docks Labor was challenged to strike by the
pig-headed persistency of the bosses in employing a
non-unionist watchman. When the challenge was ac-
cepted, and the lightermen were involved in the
dockers’ grievance, a question arose as to whether
they had not been locked oujt before their union called
them out. The -masters declared that they were not
accountable for the stoppage of lightering, but seeing
that thousands of dockers had been practically com-
pelled to knock off work in defence of the union prin-
ciple, the masters might as well have admitted their
responsibility fdr the whole trouble. The one non-
unionist watchman was employed as a test of union-
ism’s strength. He was the thin edge of a wedge for
opening the way to “free” labor at the docks, and
the refusal to withdraw the wedge amounted to an
attempt to starve the unions out of existence. A
strike thus forced upon the workers is a lock-out in
poor disguise. Only in a community of ingrained
Toryism, where Capital is still thought to be en-
titled to do as it darn well pleases, could this state
of things exist. Public Opinion— i.e., the mind of
the middle-classes —is not yet educated up to the
point of understanding that Capital’s long day for
flouting Labor unionism is quite done. And the
British “Radical” Government (so-called) trifles with
the lamentable stupidity of Public Opinion by “ap-
pointing a court to inquire into the circumstances
of the dispute among the transport workers in the
port of London.”
♦
Someone has taken the trouble to cable from
London to the effect that: —
The Pall Mall Gazette considers that Maoriland
in assenting fo Mr. Churchill’s request to allow
the battle cruiser New Zealand to remain in British
waters, has bqen more clear-sighted than those Aus-
tralians who think that the withdrawal of the New
Zealand leaves the burden of Australasia’s defence on
Australia alone. That defence, it points out, is as
much the whole Empire’s concern and the concern of
the Empire’s whole navy as the defence of London.
Leaving out the question as to the identity
of “those Australians,” the verdict is that
the Pall Mall is wasting time. Of course
Britain is pledged to defend Australia, just
as it was pledged over 100 years ago to de-
fend the “loyalists” of the United States,
whom it abandoned to the vengeance of the
new Government, and just as another em-
pire, with its headquarters in Italy, was
once pledged to the defence of Britain itself.
Italy left Britain to the wolves, after 350
years of defence, because there weren’t
enough forces left to guard all the empire,
and the farthest-out section had to be aban-
doned to its own defence ; and when that sort
of thing happens, and the farthest-out sec-
tion has no defence of its own, it is bad for
the farthest-out section. Another aspect of
the case is that the White Australia ideal
will almost certainly have to be fought for
some day. Then this country will be in a
position to ma]re one of two remarks to
its father Bull. It may be able to say:
(1) “If you decide for White Australia you
will get all the aid the Australian fleet can
give, as some sort of a set-off against Chinese
or Japanese hostility.” Or it may have to
remark: (2) If you decide for a White Aus-
tralia you get no special advantage at
sea, for you have our fleet already,
so you will probably find it easier
and cheaper to declare for the free
admission of Asiatics to this country,
and thus keep out of trouble with your
yellow friends.” No. 2 isn’t a pleasant re-
mark to have to make, but it represents the
position which certain traitorous “loyalists”
want this country to drift into.
♦
Cuba is enjoying all the blessings of cheap
and reliable colored labor. The black popu-
lation has risen against the whites with a
view to forming a purely Uncle Tom Gov-
ernment, and that proud Spanish grandee,
Don Manuel Garcia Rodriguez Pinto y San-
tiago, is fighting for his life against General
Sambo, a disembowelling sort of person
whose military methods are not pleasant.
.The recent clamor between N.S.W. and
Victoria over the American immigrants is
•boilable down to a very few words. Trea-
surer Watt, of Victoria, conceived the idea
of attracting to his State some of the U.S.
farmers who now drift towards Canada.
The N.S.W. Government was asked to share
the cost and make it a scheme for the bene-
fit of both States, but it declined. Yet
when Watt’s first contingent of Americans
came, attracted by the eloquence of the paid
Victorian emissaries, to look at Victorian
lands, they were besieged by N.S.W. agents,
and these agents wanted to deluge them with
literature to the effect that the only fit
place in all Australia Was N.S.W. Then
Watt’s lid blew off, and in his rage he
chased the N.S.W. agents with an axe.
“We are trying,” said Victorian Minister
for Works Edgar, the other day, “to recover
what. seems to be a lost art —that of ship-
building.” It was a promising art once,
in the days of wooden craft. Fair-sized
vessels were built at all manner of Austra-
lian outports, which now exist only to put
a trifle of cow-produce on board a little
imported steamer. The first little Austra-
lian-built vessel was launched 123 years ago.
The first Australian-built ship of size was
launched 107 years ago. Australian-built
ships traded to India, China, America and
even England. But the period of iron
vessels arrived, and for lack of Protection
this country had no iron industry worth
sneaking of. so a greaj business practically
died out. Nfiw there is need of a 30 per
cent, duty on imported ships to revive it.

her first few soft moments. Lat§r on, how-
ever, the guilty woman’s sleeping soliloquy
shows that, when fairly started, all moods
are alike to him. The three witches are
brought so close that a hurried society re-

makes the blasted heath scene as real as a

when he takes the hell-broth ingredients in

one by one into the bubbling cauldron, the
smell of demented cooking is strong in the

Laube whistles, and Will H. Fo% talks. The
dancing Casselli Sisters and Monie Mine
provide the most agreeable of the secondary
turns. Emerson and Baldwin, the brisk
club jugglers, depart at the end of the week.
A week or so back the Adelphi announced
that its next attempt would be “Hearts are
Trumps,” but it has changed its mind, and,
at the moment of writing, “Brought to
Ruin” is promised. However, the manage-
ment has still until Saturday to again change
its mind, if further inspection of its present
mind leads it to the belief that almost any
other sort of mind would be an improvement.
The safest thing to do is to go along and
chance it. “Brought to Ruin,” by the way,
sounds like another attack of galodrama-
“I’ve done me duty to Australia,” says
Mrs. McSweeney, at the Sydney Palace,
which is more than six masters of foreign-
going ships could say at the Water Police
Court last Monday. In the lady’s case it
was twins; in the seamen’s case it was
Chows and niggers, 14 of whom had been
allowed to enter the Commonwealth. Mrs.
McSweeney’s recompense rests in steady
business at the theatre; but the recompense
of the alien-losers was all too inadequate.
They were merely fined £l4OO. Judgment
on Maggie Moore as Mrs. McS. may be
passed at the Palace for another week, but,
alas, judgment on ship captains who let
loose Ah Pong and Rham Shirtail on a
white community can be passed only once.

“The Root of Evil,” at the Colonial No.
2, was the biggest encouragement the J. D.
Williams theatres offered during the week.
It was a good dramatic story in which the
villain, for the 38th time this year, fell in
when he tried to play tricks with a will.
“Ruins of Egypt,” at the same theatre, was
an interesting picture in colors, and included
cheerful views of the Pyramids and Sphinx,
as well as several exhilarating tombs; and
PathAs Australian Gazette showed some
scenes in the University Commem. disturb-
ance. “It was Written,” a well-mounted
Italian drama, and Path6’s European Ga-
zette, were the star items at the Lyric.
“The Law and the Lady,” a Vitagraph film
which showed some flaws in the saying that
“every man has his price,” and the Gaumont
Graphic were the most tempting of the baits
at the Colonial No. 1.

The last nights are announced of Wirths’
Circus and the Wild Australia show. The
buckjumping section will be folded up and
packed away in its moth-balls on Friday
night, and the rest of the show will manage
without it for another week, when it, too,
will quit Sydney for parts unknown. The
final buckjumpioo- championship was an-
nounced for last night, but, as this paper
had to get to Adelaide and other foreign
parts, it couldn’t vmit to hear who won.
Probably it was some cab-driver or postman.
Datas, a kind of human history-book, is
arousing loud murmurs of amazement at the
National Amphitheatre just now. Stowed
away behind a sufficiently commonplace-
looking visage, he has pretty well every hap-
pening of interest to the human race, with
the date attached, from the flight out of'
Eden to the death of Freetrade. Alf Chester
is rumored to be in his last week; but Harry
Sadler, Emerald and Barton and Bob Grieg
are going great guns.
The recent monsoonal disturbance made
no impression on “Sinbad the Sailor,” at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). Though hurri-
canes be raging this mariner pushes off at
7.45 every evening (and twice weekly at
1.45 p.m.), and reaches port some hours
later, richer both in reputation and hard
cash. He has been at this practice for five
weeks now, and the Lord only knows when
he will desist.
With ice and snow at the Sydney Glaci-
arium, West’s Pictures in Sydney are now
located at the firm’s own theatres, the Prin-
cess, in George-street, and the Olympia, in
Oxford-street. The programme at West’s
always reminds one of a menu—it is made
pp of items to catch every taste. The best
is “A Love of Long Ago.” It is a story of
the days when men wore laced coats, knicker-
bockers, buckles on their shoes and feathers
in their wide-brimmed hats. There are an
archer, his pretty daughter and a handsome
stranger. _ The officer with the mutton-chop
whiskers is ordered to arrest the handsome
stranger as a spy, and he is taken to the fort.
The archer’s daughter shoots an arrow to
which is attached a piece of string, and at
the end of the string is a rope, and down
the rope slithers the stranger. The captffin
with the chop whiskers doesn’t interfere, be-
cause he also loves the girl, and because of


STECK
One of the World’s
Great
PIANOS
*«• - ' . mmmrnmm
The name STECK on a piano is a guar-
antee that the instrument represents the
greatest possible value at its price. The
STECK is one of the finest examples of
modern piano construction. In 1876 Wag-
ner wrote of it as “a magnificent instru-
ment,”' and further stated that Liszt ex-
pressed the liveliest satisfaction after he
had played upon it.
To-day it represents all that results from
50 years of experience in manufacturing.
More STECK Pianos are being manufac-
tured and sold to-day than at any previous
period of its history—surely the best kind
of proof that the STECK Piano realises all
that is claimed for it.

Ben Hur, whose address is Sydney Royal,
has helped by now to row the galley several
miles; also, he has chariot-raced Messala
some 45yds., and won at least ss. in bets.
The silver miracle confetti that drop from
the sky in the last act are poured out by the
same saving hand, while the stallite. impati-
ently snaps his watch and does lightning

At Adelaide Royal, “Miss Gibbs” is exer-
cising her unfailing charm. It is just part
of the luck of things that the music should
be familiar to staleness before the play
arrives among the wheat stalks. There is
even in existence a plaintive song called
“Don’t Sing Yip-I-Addy.” People’s sense
of humor varies, and it is just as well. The
present writer, for instance, finds unfailing
delight in Leslie Holland and Fred Leslie,
but only feels annoyed when Bertie Wright
yells “Give me my Bag” for the 18th time.
Yet it is certain that the house in general
finds Wright the funniest of the three, and
the 18th dreadful repetition more side-split -
ting than the rest. The Tivoli has a Paxton
troop, new to Australia. The two men and
three boys merely take off their “walking”
coats before they get to their acrobatic busi-
ness, which is clever and sometimes start-
ling. The strong point of the collective
Paxtons is the absence of apparent effort,
and the sureness of the result. The three
Sisters Sprightly are back from foreign
travel and not greatly changed. The Prince
Charles ape is drawing crowds to the
King’s. He has had vice-regal patronage,
limited in a marked manner to this turn
only. West’s and Wondergraph and the
Empire keep on presenting good picture-
programmes, and are beginning to show a
commendable willingness to encourage films
of plays written and acted in Australia.

Stripped of its richly gaudy scenery and
occasional suggestions of Kismetian bar-
barism, the structure of “The Cingalee” is
a sorry thing. The musical comedy, re-
vived at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), last
Saturday, is as bare of originality and desti-
tute of human color as the common or hen-
laid egg-shell. Its story and the whole form
of its first act are stolen from “Florodora.”
The btown Boobfiama Bhoy, described as a
Noble of Kandy, brings amalgamated remin-
iscences of the ‘Rajah of Bhong and the
Mandarin in “San Toy.” The soubrette,
Peggy, was lifted from “The Geisha.” And
of the variety items in the second act, the
“Gollywog” turn has the longest chain of
ancestry, for it can be traced in direct
descent from Gilbert’s “The Mountebanks.”
Perhaps Chambuddy Ram, the Babu lawyer
who bears much the same relationship tc
this medley as Professor Tweedlepunch bore
to “Florodora,” is distinctively humorous,
but otherwise the show is without a joke of
its own. The first essential to keen enjoy-
ment of “The Cingalee” _ is a profound ig-
norance of all the musical comedies that
have gone before. Anyhow the music, save
for one or two sentimental ballads, is notably
tinkly, and not even ear-biting at that.
# * * *
Any of the strictly home-made musical
comediefe, which flourished ere the Germans
restored comic opera to the English stage,
might have served for a sermon on. the de-
generacy of social sentiment in the Smart
Set. “The Cingalee” would supply the
meatiest text of the long series. A Ceylon
tea-planter, of noble British birth, is bent
on marrying a hybrid Ceylon girl, who
babbles of herself as “Nanoya,” and is about
half as civilised and intelligent as the late
Mrs. Butterfly or the Queen of the Red-
skins, just now battling at the Princess’s.
The titled sister of this solemnly inane and
love-sick Honorable Vereker comes to Cey-
lon, to expostulate with him, and there meets
the inevitable “Bobbie” Johnnie of her
heart, from whom she had parted in London,
because he referred to his rival —her lady-
ship’s pet pug dog—as a little beast. The
British High Commissioner of Ceylon is a
blithering old ass, named Loftus, and Peggy,
the giddy young Belgravian spinster of the
piece, is tearing round the world in pursuit
of a colored prince. When she finds he
isn’t a prince, but merely a Babu liar in the
employ of _ a preposterous potentate, who
wears a ring in his nose, she adores the
little horror just the same, and takes him as
her gollywog for life. Any other characters
in “The Cingalee” are admiring friends and
hangers-on of the deplorable creatures afore-
said. What a dainty dish to set before loyal
subjects of the King on Empire Day, or
thereabouts!
Talleur Andrews, as the heroic simnleton,
took his Nanoya quite seriously, and sang
like an artist on Saturday night. Miss
Arundale shone moderately in song and
conversation, as the wondrous tea-girl
who talks broken English and is for-
ever putting a name to herself, and
was brilliant in a Cingalese war dance, or
jump-de-joy. Roberts was a loud, emphatic
Bobbie, and Miss Toung, as the lady who
preferred him to her pug, sang indifferently
some songs that didn’t suit her voice a little
bit. Victor Prince was the Rajah. The
“fattest” section of the farce fell to W. S.
Percy and his bright young colleague, Miss
Dorothy Brunton; whilst Jack Cannot im-
parted some sort of character to his sketch
of the High Commissioner, by making him
like Fred Kaye, of yore. If he had issued
peremptory instructions to “Bring along
the tea, bring along the tea,” he would have
sounded exactly like Kaye up-to-date. # Miss
Vivian Talleur and others frisked inciden-
tally, and the scenery and fittings merited
much applause. The “Cingalee” is for two
weeks only, for on Saturday (June 8) the
Quinlan Grand Opera -Co. starts what is
truthfully proclaimed “the biggest and costli-
est enterprise that has yet visited Aus-
tralia.”
“ KISMET ” AT MELBOURNE ROYAL

Wasir Mansoor.

dancer.
Having failed on the first night to dis-
cover in u Queen of the Redskins & single
incident which was not preposterous, this
paper again looked in at the Princess s dui-
ing the week. The rational interlude, if it
exists, continues to hide its light beneath a
bushel of dead leaves or inside .Wahneetah s
wigwam, which is not illumined by the
fierce rays which usually beat upon the
sleeping apartment of a heroine. The ab-
sence of a “bedroom scene” is the most note-
worthy feature of a blithersome production.
A liaison between the paleface villain and
his uncle’s missus, and the said villain's
offer to sell his lawful wedded squaw to an
undersized millionaire (in return for coin
which the latter promises him on his “word
of honor”) are the only sops thrown to
lovers of the spicy in dramatic art. Wah-
neetah, although her claim to the title of
Queen of the Redskins is as doubtful as
would be that of the daughter of George V.
to the designation of Queen of the Pale-
faces, wears the linen feathers of a blameless
life with a certain amount of dignity; but,
all things considered, she fails to rise to the
level of her scenic surroundings, which are
the noblest work of Mann. Also, the vil-
lain’s mental altitude must be measured by
the fact that when he has murdered his uncle
in the middle of his back, from afar off, he
puts his revolver in the corpse’s hand and
calls it an obvious case of suicide.

The present bill at the Opera House is a
power in the land. Rinaldo, the magnetic
violinist, is back for a few nights, and the
juggler and the musical clowns who earned
the goodwill of this column a week ago have
not disimproved on acquaintance. Also, in
the middle distance and background of
novelty are massed the forces of the Keeley
Brothers of the punch-ball, the Amaranths,
Blake and Granby. Niagara and Falls,
Frank Sidney and Co. and Ronald George.
This is a time when the Rickards programme
holds out very little inducement for a rush
to the refreshment bar.
Among the traffic across Spencer’s sheet
in Melbourne last week was “You Remem-
ber Ellen,” a matter containing two wander-
ing lovers and a hunk of bread. As conven-
tional as a Bruce Smith oration was “Willie
on Horseback,” and another undistinguished
traveller was the comic item, “Wifey’s Ma
Came Back.” “Love Finds a Way” was
the best matter in the show.

Melbourne is losing its picturesque batch
of Bagdad immigrants, just as the city is
getting to know their nicknames by hearc,
and speak of them with undue levity. The
leading characters in “Kismet” are familiar
in the local mouth as household words. The
Sheik Jawan is commonly called Old
Shaker”; Hajj is “Hadjective,” on account
of his bad language; whilst his Slice : of-the-
Moon,” Marsinah, is ticketed ‘ Maizena.
The Caliph has been translated into Calf-
lymph,” and his fraudulent prime minister
will long be remembered as the W owser
Monseer.” These people are passing out of
view on Friday, and on Saturday the glories
of “Othello” are to be revived. It was
stated, on official authority, that The Vir-
gin Goddess” would follow “Kismet, there-
fore Oscar Asche’s sudden determination to
throw the Goddess over warns The Bulle-
tin to qualify its announcement ot
“Othello” with the letters D.V.
** * *
The outstanding defect of “The Chance
of a Lifetime,” resuscitated at the Ivin S s
on Saturday night, is that the gifted author
(one Nathaniel Gould) has drawn a villain
of such arresting psychological interest that
he is apt to absorb the attention which
should be spread out upon the hippodrama
as a whole. In his tragic incompetence
Captain Clinch stands alone. The stark
foolishness of his attempt to steal the mare
Trixie seems sweetly reasonable compared
with his sublimely fatuous effort to get at
the noble jock in the crowded saddling pad-
dock at Ascot, and both of these primitive
attempts at crime pale beside the subsequent
doings of the brainless malefactor. The
captain has an intellectual rival m the
hero, Dick Douglas, who makes a fatheaded
wager with Clinch that his (Richards)
nag will win the Astjot Gold Cup, and that
he (Richard) will drink out of the utensil
the night after. Seeing that Clinch himself
lias a noddy which is regarded as a serious
rival to Trixie, and in view of the further
uossibilitv of one of numerous outsiders
romping home, the wager seems a bit over
the odds in the way of absurdity, even for a
racing drama. Clinch’s knavish tricks aie
frustrated, partly because of the mnate no-
bility of Jockey Ames, and partly thi ough
the efforts of Mrs. Edgar, a lady whose pre-
sent attractiveness is rather enhanced by
the delicately modulated suggestion of a not
wholly blameless past.
* * *
In nearly every respect the present cast
is an improvement upon the one previously
associated with the piece The
young characters are played by less mature
performers than before, when both the hero
and his girl carried weight for age. Herbert
Bentley acts easily -as Dick Douglas, and
makes that fatuous young sport as likely as
the Diana of Miss Beatrice Holloway is
likeable. The Joe Robson of Charles Brown
is not wholly unworthy of the love ,' v y 1 “ I c A li a
graceful Mrs. Edgar (Ada Guildford) with-
holds from him until the last act. The
superciliousness of Clinch is only slightly
overdone by Hilliard Vox, and Tom Cannam
is good enough as the Hon. Bob Lovett, al-
though he differs from most persons with an
impediment in the speech. In moments or
excitement he forgets to stutter. Wingfield
Stirling, as the custodian of the blessed
Gold Cup, deserves a Hal Gye drawing all
to himself, and the mare behaves in an un-
impeachable manner, even when addressed
by her owner as “old man.”
“Mary McC.”: Came across a remarkable
passage in an address delivered to some
English curates about the latter end of the
eighteenth century by a divine of repute who
wrote about Christian evidences and other
things without much economic value. The
archdeacon person warned his hearers
against the snares -of women, and told them
that it was neither a comely nor a Chris-
tian thing to be too often drunk about the
village alehouses. Evidently the piety ot
that day was of a quiet order. Even saints
were allowed to get glad in moderation. It
is almost shuddersome to contemplate the
dizzy moral heights on which the curate or
to-day stands. I can’t help feeling that it
would do him a world of good to come down
every now and then' to the human level, an cl
be taken home at la.m. by an intoxicated
crayfish under the light of two-and-a-halt
moons.
A member of this paper’s literary staff
has been getting passionate letters ot late
from total strangers of the female Persua-
sion. The ladies want to know why the
addressee doesn’t behave like a gent, and re-
sume friendly relations; they also inquire
where he is anyhow, and what he means to
do about it. They invariably explain that
they have only dared his anger by writing
to the office, since they were unable to get
any answer from the P.O. address The
elusiveness of the prey, is due to the tact
that, qua journalist, he is non-existent. Just
as the female roysterer, when hauled before
a police court and charged, invariably re-
presents herself to be an actress., so, for
some weird reason, it is the habit ot the
cheap or money-saving amorist to pose as a
pressman. Incongruous though it may ap-
pear, the members of The Bulletin staff
are not young and picturesque bloods, har
from it. Mostly they are married, or bald,
or hopelessly religious, or all three. -the
wisest plan for any Melbourne or Sydney
citizen who is pitched a glozing tale ot love,
insolvency or what not, by an alleged I>ul-
LETiN-ite is to proceed with the glozer s
name, description and private address to the
office. The odds are that the next move will
be with the police.
AT POVERTY POINT.
From the office dog-fancier: “I saw ‘The Blue
Bird’ for the first time a couple of nights ago, and
herewith beg to dissent in strenuous fashion from
the encomiums that have been lavished on the actor
who plays Tylo. As I read it, Maeterlinck intended
the Dog to be the Hero of the play—a benign god
in the car, who swoops down opportunely from time
to time, and rescues Virtue in distress. The devoted
animal is limned at Sydney Criterion as a gyrating,
half-witted mountebank. Of course there are dogs
who behave in this fashion—Scotch terriers, cocker
spaniels, poodles, and such-like small fry and canine
dust. They habitually express their devotion by
bounding frenziedly against their owner s legs, and
whirling purposelessly round and round. But also
there are dogs which are dignified and self-restrained.
Newfoundlands, mastiffs and bulldogs are in this
category. They would scorn to debase themselves by
such antics as Tylo indulges in at the Cri.; and the
same remark applies to almost any sizeable dog.
Had I had the job of producing ‘The Blue Bird, 1
would have insisted on Tylo being presented, not as
a gambolling puppy, but as a staid and business-like
watch-dog. If Maeterlinck didn’t intend the children
to be protected by that sort of bow-wow, he might
just as well, for all dramatic purposes, have sent
them forth under the eye of a Schipperke.
• “Floater”: I have noted with amazement —almost
I had written with incredulity—in numerous news-
papers that Lily Brayton has worn her absolutely
priceless necklace of black opals for years, without
experiencing the jabs and stabs of outrageous ill-
fortune. All 1 can say is that her experience has
been different from mine. A while back my wife gave
a keg of the ebony gems to the baby to play with.
An hour afterwards the infant swallowed a handful of
them, and died in convulsions. A favorite dog bit
the undertaker in the resultant excitement; and it
also died. The day after, my grandfather tripped
over the keg and broke his face in two places; our
only son got converted by the Chapzander mission ,
and the cook sent in her papers and left our service.
In despair my wife gave the opals away to the dust-
man, not even daring to use them as top-dressing
for the garden lawn. The dustman was arrested
next day and got a long sentence. I might say that
we decline to have anything about the place now
but diamonds and emeralds, and I would earnestly
implore Lily to do the same. Anyhow, I would ask
her not to wear her costly opals so often. Their
influence is dire, and they are really not safe out of
a burglar’s keeping.
“Harrison O” : The bellowdrama villain makes me
tired. Here’s his latest freak. Tn “Queen of the
Redskins,” at Melbourne Princess’s, the malefactor
is desirous of sending the heavy father to meet his
Maker, and so hisses to his skirted accomplice (who,
by the way, is the wife of the ancient) : “En-gage
heem in conversation and I’ll do it! I’ll make it
look like a case of suicide 1” The villainess per-
forms her part of the job, and her partner enters
the room behind the pair with a revolver and evil
intentions, and shoots the old chap in the back.
Then he crosses the victim’s arms on his chest and
decamps with the newly-manufactured widow. And
in the next act everybody except a comic servant
has taken it for granted that the old boy died by
his own hand, and so far as I can see the audience
doesn’t make so much as a fidget of protest.
“Private Boxer”: I’m for a White Australia all
the time, and I don’t suppose my friends, the thea-
trical managers of these parts, love our colored
brother —or sister —any more than I do. It is, how-
ever, a rather remarkable fact that the present shows
at all the principal Melbourne play-houses are pie-
bald —tarred with the same brush, so to speak. At
the Royal we have “Kismet”—a “great _ Oriental
dramatic spectacle,” to be followed by “Othello.
At Her Majesty’s “The Cingalee,” a pictute of the
golden glowing East” (vide the golden glowing
advt.) ; and at the Princess’s there is “the beautiful
Red Indian romantic play, ‘Queen of the Redskins.
“Adelaide”: The unknown writer of a par. in B.
23/5/’l2, goes out of his way to say that Sara Bern-
hardt “nowadays is merely a very long bone stood
up on end.” Let him go and see el c^ n §
“Camille” in the picture-shows, and he will find
that nowadays she is plump, not to say matronly.
Sara was thin 30 years ago. So was G. 11. Reid.
The villainess of “When London Sleeps” repents
in the third act, and is commanded by the hero to
“Go, and sin no more.” These things are allowed
to the Founder of Christianity and the hero of melo-
drama.
“10-2-4”: The cheap bellowdrama of these parsons
makes me dead, dog tired. The latest outburst
occurred last Sunday in Goulburn (N.S.W.), where
a clerical sensation-monger, observing that a news-
paper belonging to one of the opposition creeds had
published some remarks derogatory to Empire Day,
proceeded “to hurl the foul allegations back con-
temptuously in the editor’s teeth.’ According to
Sydney Telegraph (28/5/’12): “By way of
emphasising his protest, the preacher flung the
offending journal out of the pulpit. There would
be general disapproval if a mere lay-preacher m
(say) the butchering trade started flinging a business
rival’s meat among the faithful by way of emphasis-
ing his disapproval of the wares; and there would
be unfavorable comment if some fishmongermg
Wesley or Calvin made a practice of scornfully
dashing mullet, squid, prawns, etc., purchased from
the opposition oyster-saloon, on to the floor of nis
place of worship. The principle is the same in the
Goulburn case above-mentioned, but since it is an
Archdeacon who performs the absurd act, criticism
is stifled.
Thus Hilda Spong at the conclusion of her Maon-
land tour: “I have not been impressed WithChnst-
church audiences. I feel that they go to the theatres
to enjoy themselves at their own sweet will, and in
whatever way they like. If they feel so inclined
they will whistle during a performance. They are
the worst audiences I have ever played to in any
part of the world. They seem unable to understand
at its true value anything staged. The capital of
Canterbury will now pour ashes on its head and take
a back seat.
The fact that Wellington (M.L.), with a popula-
tion of 70,000, has opened its eighth big flicker
theatre suggests that the time is ripe for a return
showing (1) how many picture shows there are in
Australasia; (2) how many people they provide a
crust for; (3) what is the total amount of capital
sunk in them; (4) the average attendance at flicker
theatres per month.
Novelist Vachell’s play, originally christened The
Kangaroo,” has been successfully produced at Wynd-
ham’s (London), under the brief title of Jelf s.
The change was due to the fact that there is a piece
called “The Kangaroo” running in America, and
shortly to be transferred to the London stage, Rl eh ar d
Jelf, the hero of this play, was nicknamed The Kan-
garoo” at school, because he was a bit of a
bounder.” He goes knocking about the world for a
year or two in California, Australia and else-
where. Returns a “rough diamond,” to find himself
the principal partner in the old-fashioned, highly-
respectable Jelf’s Bank. Love and complications
ensue There is a remarkably realistic run upon the
bank, one of the best stage-crowd effects seen for a
long time. Gerald du MaUrier, who shines in rough
diamond rSles, scored as usual. Cyril Keightley, the
Australian, is praised for “a polished bit of acting.
“C. Ockney”: Australia’s „ old footlights friend,
William Hawtrey, was, by latest advices, piling up
the dollars in the land where they mint them, with
a comedy called “Dear Old Billy.” His’ brother
Charles has just started a season in N Yark with
“Dear Old Charlie.” William’s “Billy” and Charlie s
“Charlie” are one and the same piece—an adaptation
of a torrid French farce adapted by British play-
censor “Charlie” Brookfield, in his unregenerate days,
before his writings wore a neck-to-knee costume and
he didn’t mixed-bathe in print.

“Petrol” explodes
The narrow escape in Port Jackson, the other day,
of a man and woman from a blazing" motor-launch,
leads me to blow my horn in the ear of the marine
authorities, and demand to be told what they are
going to do about it. The law as it stands cannot
interfere with petrol-driven vessels or electric-pro-
pelled craft, although the Harbor Trust makes some
attempt to control those plying for hire in Port
Jackson. No interference is attempted at places like
the Hawkesbury, Jervis Bay and Brisbane Water,
where motor-launches are the common means of
transport. At Woy Woy, some of these vessels
convoy as many as 80 people at a time; and no
precautions are enforcable, as in the case of steam
craft, for saving life. This, despite the fact that
the motor-launch is more prone to ordinary accident.
But the greatest danger is that of fire. All mineral
spirits exude a gas which mixes with the air and
becomes a dangerous explosive. It collects inside
the floors and timbers, and, should a spark set it
off, the launch is almost at once ablaze from end to
end. I was not long ago on a launch, making a 50-
nnle run down one of the northern rivers. The
boat was strewn with sleeping children and women
at 11 p.m., and we were miles from any settlement,
when a fatuous dad struck a match to look at his
kiddy, who was moaning with too much picnic in his
interior. Instantly there was a blue light and a
‘ whoosh” from one extremity of the boat to the
other, and some cushions at the far end of the launch
burst into flame. Alert passengers madly flung
cushions, coats, baskets, etc., overboard, and after
two minutes of dreadful anxiety, the fire was got
under. At the time we were in midstream, with
nothing but the launch to save us, and, had we not
beaten the fire out as quickly as it started, we might
all have been marked “roasted meat” on the coroner’s
menu. Poss'bly some of the party would have leaped
overboard, and the coroner; would have had to go
short in their case—provided, of course, he couldn’t
warn the sharks off in time. Finally, I reckon some-
thing ought' to be done.
“Australasian”: Better hurry up that kid
array. I say that, because I am at Singa-
pore, and hear quite a lot of things that are
apparently not dreamed of in Australian
philosophy. Here’s something to chew from
the Singapore Free Press (23/4/T2)
There is reason to think that the Chinese Govern-
nient regards the question in Java as very serious.
If it can—and it seems to entertain IPM » doubt on
the subject—force the Dutch Government to accept
the Chinese on equal terms with the Japanese, the
first step will have been taken, and the most diffi-
cult. It is probable that the Australians will then
come in for attention, and England will be asked to
bring pressure to bear on the colony. The Chinese
are very hopeful of success up to that point, but
they consider that “Uncle Sam” will prove a tough
customer, when his turn comes.
The point is that the Japs have obtained
recognition in Java as “Europeans,” and
you can take it from a man who knows
that they are going to have a try for similar
recognition elsewhere. In this case, Else-
where will probably have Australia on top
of the list.
Death has been working long hours in the
family of Queen Mother Alexandra. Whilst
she was in Copenhagen waiting for the
funeral of her brother, the late King of
Denmark (who had dropped dead in the
street at Hamburg and been taken to the
Morgue to be inquested) her nephew George
—sister Thyra’s son—was killed in a motor
accident. One tragedy had caused the other.
The unlucky George was tooting at full
speed to his uncle’s funeral when the car
came to smash. r If the rules of Chance are
strictly enforced there will be one more sud-
den calamity in the royal family of Den-
mark before the month is out. The ghost
of Hamlet, senior, must be prowling hard
around the battlements of the castle at Elsi-
nore.
A Parramatta (N.S.W.)
landlord is recovering from
shattered nerves, caused by the
behavior of 'a tenant from Vic-
tdria. The man from Weary-
land took the house, paid a
fortnight’s rent —perhaps about
50s. —-and promised to pay
some, more' in another fort-
night. But when the landlord
had got round .the next corner
the tenant leaped to the near-
est agent and told him that he
was leaving the State, and had
a place to sell cheap. The
building was worth £6OO, but
he would take £4OO cash, or
1200 deposit, and the rest could
stand on mortgage. A buyer
soon yawped along, and bought
the house, just as an ordinary
person would buy an evening
paper. Apparently he didn’t
stop to inquire if the vendor
really owned the premises, and
had any right to sell them, nor
d d lie demand a preliminary
view of the deeds. He just put
up the £2OO, as any trustful
citizen might, and went to
dwell in his purchase till de-
tails were arranged. Mean-
while the seller left all his
bills behind him and ran like
the wind. He is said to be still
cantering hard. It is reported that he' is
known to have sold several houses after
the same fashion in his own State, yet the
long blue minions of O’Callaghan apparently
never overtook him. Perhaps if he sells
Government House and its contents, includ-
his Ex.’s cocked and golden hat, to a youth
from the bush, the Law will really get after
him in earnest.
THE SAFE OLD WAY.
"We've been nodding to each other for such a considerable time that I resolved to speak to you
this morning. Er—can you lend me half a crown?"
“I think we’d better stick to the mading system.”
A. .T. Ambrose lodges a protest against the
Defence Department.
Consider the furious speed with which Australia’s
Defence Department does its business. At the beginning
of last year Ulan (N.S.W.) decided to form a rifle
club. On March 8, 1911, the acting hon. sec. of the
embryo institution wrote to headquarters, and in due
course received a letter from the officer supervising
rifle clubs, asking for a parish map, so that the range
could be inspected. Towards the end of the year an
inspector arrived. This official was so maddened at
missing the Test match that he could hardly, sum-
mon up the energy to inspect anything. However,
he did his duty ultimately, and departed. Then a
period of profound peace and inaction set in. The
original sec. resigned in despair after a while, and
another was appointed. He tried the local member
(W. J. Johnson), and later Senator Pearce. On
18/3/T2 word came, from Pearce that the construc-
tion of a rifle range af, Ulap'jwayld „receive attention.
Nothing has been done since' then, and by the look
of things nothing is going to be done.
We have 33 men here. The small places round
would make the'number up to 50.' They are mostly
farmers or sons of farmers- —tough,, sturdy bushmen,
keen of eye and strong of arm, anxious to help de-
fend their country. Isn’t it good national business
to encourage such citizens ? I pause for a reply.
The Victorian railway authorities are
much exercised over an irregularity that hap-
pened lately, and has hitherto occurred but
twice in a blue moon, or thereabouts. The
other morning the driver of the engine on
the melancholy little, Glen Iris line left the
terminus without coupling up. When he
pulled up at the next station the waiting
passenger naturally asked him if he had the
train in his pocket, or where it was, and
then he looked back and found nothing be-
hind him but scenery and atmosphere. As
the driver returned for the rest of the out-
fit, and ultimately reached the city up to
time, no harm was done to anybody, especi-
ally as the line, being a ndn-paying, boom-
built affair, doesn’t do enough business to
pay the driver’s wages. But some busy-
body must needs mention the matter at head-
quarters ; and the officials woke up and
looked round for someone to “carpet.” Un-
fortunately, they couldn’t find any one of
the 2000-odd departmental regulations that
would fit the case, that great railway genius
Tait having overlooked the possibility of
such a happening. It seems to be in the
main a reflection on the time-table. The
fixed official speed was so slow that it was
possible to go back for the lost train, and
then make up arrears without turning a
hair.
The community that starves its education
vote inevitably falls behind. On top of the
scarifying reports of thriftiness as regards
primary education in Victoria, comes a blis-
tering report on the inadequate provision for
higher education, at Melbourne University.
The lecture rooms and theatres are' over-
crowded, ill-ventilated and ill-lighted, and
the class rooms are insanitary. Instead of
providing for the immediate future as it
goes along, the State hasn’t even made pro-
vision for the present, there having been
CHILDREN IN ARMS.
I most strongly object to night drill for boys of
tender age—and I have my youngest son now 'drill-
ing- at night.
Not one of my other sons has been out at night
at his young age without their mother or father.
Drilling after tea, at night-time, will cause bitter
sorrow in many an Australian household.
—“A Country Father,” in S. M. Herald.
Following out “Dad's" suggestion, why no
train the mothers with the sons?
practically no development for the last 25
years. Now the Senate asks for six new
theatres, each accommodating 200 students ;
12 new class rooms, each to hold 60 stu-
dents, with a private room or study adjoin-
ing each, and a laboratory for experimental
education. The sum required is £60,000, and
if any liich Landlord feels disposed to ad-
vertise his patriotism, Treasurer Watt will
pass him the glad hand and the attractive
smile, and will doubtless mention his name
in those regions where K.C.M.G.’s are
manufactured. And if all the Rich Land-
lords speak at once Watt will doubtless sus-
tain the shock.
THE SINNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My objection to missions is that they are wrong
from beginning to end. They start upon a wrong
basis. First of all, they try to make people believe that
they are far greater sinners than they really are. They
make them think that their imaginary sins are lead-
ing them to an imaginary hell, and to save them
from imaginary damnation they make up an imag-
inary scheme of redemption. —Statement by the Ilev.
George Walters, of the Sydney Unitarian Church.
I never smoked a cigarette, nor spent my hard-earned
tin
In treating Popsie to. a glass of lemon-flavored gin.
\et I am Lost. High Heaven waits; nor can I enter
in.
I never dined down town at night on prawns and
pickled pork,
Nor balanced Popsie’s shining shoe upon a silver fork.
1 never tasted bitter beer —stay! once I smelt a
cork.
1 never ogled Loo and Liz upon a Manly boat;
Some other fellow always is the sinful, lucky goat.
(The sins of golden hairs and brown rest heavy on
his coat!)
I never backed a racehorse. And I always shall
refuse —
Unless I get the office straight by some cute stable
ruse.
(It’s very wrong to back a horse, and then to .see
him lose.)
I never walked the beaches with a siren-seeking
look ;
I turn my back toward the surf, my eyes upon a
book —-
But stay ! One day, I grieve to say, a little glance
• I took.
I, never played a hand at cards, my downfall to
proclaim,
Nor threw the dotted squares until the light of
morning came.
(Though “once, or twice, to throw the dice is a
gentlemanly game.”)
So I have sinned too, deep for words. My character
is tost,
As so much shattered wreckage, on the Maelstrom of
the Lost;
I sinned my sins exceedingly;—and I must pay the
cost!
But if the lesson of my life shall make salvation
plain
fo you whose still untempted souls bear no un-
seemly stain,
I’ll not regret my life of sin. I’ll not have sinned
in vain.

A FAVORITE SWEATER
Last week we illustrated our New Coat Sweater
with the turned-down collar.
To-day we draw attention to the improvements
made in our first introduction —-the Vest Sweater.
For this Season we have added two roomy pockets.
Also, the material is better in quality. The su-
perior finish is another decided step forward. The
shaping conforms more to the figure.
We feel that we are offering a particularly fine
value in our Vqst Sweaters for the 1912 Winter.
The colors are White, Brown, Grey or Navy pure

“Public Servant” writes:—
The NSW Public Service has cause to thank
Labor Minister Carmichael for the stand he has
taken in connection with the appointment of Public
Librarian. This office is the only decently-paid one
which is open to the library staff, and on the staff
Service Board, and when a vacancy occurs the trus-

the Minister in charge with the expectation that the
nomination will be accepted. But, the other day,
when the trustees. nominated Dr. Watson, one of

going strong, and the Public Service, which is not

Superintendent. Webb, of-the Sydney Fire
Brigade, writtag to Aet and ArchitectUßE
to protest against the herd of skyscrapers
now bound in" up from the Sydney streets,
says that even with the most up-to-date en-
gxues, when buildings rise 200 ft. High and
over, the attempt to fight a serious fire would
be almost abortive. But the point in his illu-
minating remarks which calls for more par-
tionlar notice is here
The law in this State ‘(N.S.W.) limits the height
of any building to. Iooft< f y.6t look around and see,
through the apathy of tfre pYopk. the hundreds of
buildings here where .the law has -been evaded.
But what about the apathy of the law—
where does that lohg.-eared quadruped come
in, and who is the party responsible for its
debut. Webb seems to have s opped short
on the brink of a vast' opportunity to un-
load some valuable information. Anyhow,
now that attention has been drawn to the
matter so publicly, what does the law pro-
pose to do about it?

An otherwise uninteresting case about a
dog in Adelaide last week was enlivened,
more or less, by some legal humor. 1 lain-
tiff, who had bought the pup, said it was a
mongrel. Defendant, who sold it to her,
maintained that it was a pure-bred Pomer-
aman—and eventually the Court though so
too. An expert mentioned that a “Show
dog” has two coats, an under and an over,
Said the Bench: “This is one of the cases,
then, where you can’t tell a thing by its
overcoat.” Said the Bar: “That is not the
only resemblance between a dog and a saus-
age.” (Laughter in court.) But nobody
seems to have taken the obvious chance of
saying that both may he half-bread.
PROOF POSITIVE.
“Do you mean to tell me that the canary died
a natural death? ”
“ Yes mum. I see'd the cat eat it with my own
eyes this mornin ’!”
“Nemo” : The death of W. A. Zeal, who
was one of tne engineers on the Melbourne-
Bendigo railway, brings to mind the vast
lawsuit, Cornish and Bruce v. the Queen,
that followed the big job. It was the firsc
trial at bar ever heard in Australia, and I
don’t know that there has been one since.
Trial at bar meant a vast legal scuffle before
the Full Court and a jury of 12. The Judges
in Cornish and Bruce v. the Queen were Sta-
well, Redmond Barry and Williams; and
among the counsel were Dick Ireland, T. H.
Fellowes, R. A. Billing, J. D. Wood, George
Higinbotham, C. A. Smyth and Henry
Wrixon —all big men. The hearing lasted
60 days, and each juror drew 300 guineas
as fees. I remember calling round at the
old Supreme Court in Latrobe-street, on the
night the case was finished, and helping to
spend part of his little lot with John Pear-
son, leather merchant ancl tanner, who had
been one of the dozen.
“Bindley”: The Melbourne playbill of
“Sergeant Brue” (King’s Theatre) alleges
that “The Production is Produced in Lavish
Style.” Yet the man who wrote that had
at command aR the resources of the most
copious language under the stars —a lan-
guage of some 250,000 words. It reminds
me of the junior reporter who writes “A
sad occurrence unhappily occurred.” The
other day I heard the question: “Have the
blokes got that bloke yet that murdered that
bloke?” The speaker had all the earmarks
of a bloke himself, and so had the person
addressed. This economy of words is
heroic. It recalls the old Punch picture of
a British yokel reading the Crimean War
news at the time when things were tem-
porarily looking up for Russia. In a puzzle-
headed fashion he spoke thus: “W’y, ’stead
of 'era’s heatin’ ’em it seems that ’era’s beat-
in’ ’em.” Perhaps a lot of our language is
superfluous.
A recent court case in Melbourne dis-
closed the champion transient couple of the
Commonwealth, in the shape of a .man and
wife who had dwelt in 57 different houses
during the six years of their married life.
The wife sued for maintenance, and she
seemed to have an idea that the eternal
move-on business was evidence of her hus-
band’s neglect, though some women would
have welcomed it as that variety that is the
£pice of wife. She said he would hire a
house, furnish it on time-payment, and then
disconnect himself from the matter entirely,
with the result that each time she was
turned out into the street. She seems to
have had a consider-
ab 1 e experience at
little cost. There was
always the joy of
speculating what the
next house would be
like, whether it would
have a gas-stove, or a
fire-stove, whether the
copper and wash-
troughs would be in
the yard or in the
front bedroom, whether
there would be any
locks on the doors and
cupboards, or whether
there would be no cup-
boards at all, and only
half a door, whether
the yard would be
large enough to run
fowls, or small enough
to hang oneself in.
Then she had the fun
of interviewing hun-
dreds of house-agents,
and getting Ihe keys
and inspecting the
mansions, and then the
joy of coming back
and saying she would
take the place if they
would paper and paint it
throughout, and stop the
leaks in the mof. Also,
she had the luxury of
sampling dozens of con-
signments of new time-
payment furnifure, and
pawing it over, and ex-
p'aining to dozens of sets
of new-made acquaint-
ances that various ar-
ticles were wedding pres-
ents, while others had
come to her as heirlooms,
or something similar, the
while the said acouaint-
ances turned green with envy, and im-
mediately went and indulged in a
new bedroom suite at the t.p. furni-
ture shop. Besides all this, there were
at least 57 new butchers, bakers, milk-ohs !,
wood and coal providores, grocers, etc., to
interview and engage, or otherwise, as she
felt inclined. That woman could have had
an awful lot of happiness if she didn’t miss
her chances, but the appearances are that
she did. Hubby swore she was weary
and shiftless, that he had earned 365.
a week most of the time, and had only kept
2s. a week for himself- —“the rest she had
spent on lollies and fancy wafers at Is. 6d.
a box.” There was obviously some slight
exaggeration about the narratives, so the jus-
tices adjourned the case for eight weeks, to
give them a chance to set up a permanent
home. But there is little hope. After 57
enterings-in and. 57 heavings-out, the wan-
derlust or shifting habit has got into tlmir
veins, and they must just trapse round for
the rest of their days.

“Snell”: As I anticipated when drawing
the attention of Wowse to the growth of the
camping-out habit (B. 2/5/’l2), the good
and godly are now down on the infamous
custom of mixed peoples going down to the
sea or out to the trees, and living the simple
life in tents, hollow logs, gunyalis, humpies
and other unsanctified places. The Melb.
Presbyterian General Assembly was particu-
larly wroth over the matter at its latest
cackling. The chief accusation against the
evil practice was that it kept the young
people from church. What dreadful reflec-
tors upon the Church these Church people
are! In their opinion there apparently is
nothing on earth that isn’t strong enough to
keep folks out of the tabernacle.
UP TO DATE.
Although the whirlwind campaign of Vedrines in
his candidature for Limoux did not secure his return,
the tempestuous aviator, with the sole aid of
a monoplane, and his intensely patriotic extem-
pore speeches, succeeded in securing 0927 votes
against his opponent’s 7690. He flew from place to place
in the 152 communes which make up the division,
and wherever he stopped, the machine was surrounded
by a large crowd, and whenever he held a meeting
in the same place as his opponent, the latter wasted
his persuasiveness upon the desert air. —French paper.
The Hon. Member addresses his constituents at

Some Adelaide jester who loves to see
the stout citizen puffing along under a plug
hat to spread his futile coat-tails and swell
up at a reception, last week telephoned
round inviting many of him to hurry along
to the Town Hall and meet the Gaud Mayor
of London. He generously allowed him to
take his choice of morning or evening dress;
also, he magnanimously refrained from lur-
ing a wild or country mayor from the back-
blocks, by commanding him to come down
in all his rabbit skins and be made a
K.C.M.G. in front of a large and representa-
tive gathering of Adelaideans. If he had,
tne large and representative gathering would
have fallen on the perplexed bush mayor with
foolish speeches of welcome and inquiries
as to how London was looking when he left.
And if the mayor was a large, raw-boned
specimen, who fairly hungered for his knight-
hood, and suspected his leg was being pulled,
he might have kicked the most prominent or
protruding citizen, and caused a riot in
which many bellto’ppers would have been
crushed underfoot like peanut shells.
Consider the possibilities of the passenger
on the colored labor ship when his nigger-
manned vessel collides on a dark night with
the gate of Hell, and the lights go out, and
half an ocean pours in, and it is realised all
in an instant that there are only 30 minutes
between the bump and the sea bottom. One
big liner recently tried to go to sea from an
English port with a csew of 326, of whom
only ten were able-bodied white seamen, and
there was trouble over the matter. The
spectacle of 10 able seamen —if five of them
weren’t killed or maimed in the collision — 1
trying to get out about 20 boats with one
hand, and get a herd of women and
children into these boats with the other,
and allay the panic of perhaps 300 pas-
sengers with the other, and keep off about
150 maddened niggers with the other, while
with the other hand they sent up rockets,
and brought provisions for the boats, and
tried to work the pumps in order to gain a
little time —well, it would be a strenuous
time for these 10 able-bodied seamen, wbo
would possiulv consist of four assorted Bri-
tons, two Germans, a Swede, a Norwegian,
a Spaniard and an Italian. At times like
these Britain rules the waves with some
difficulty. One of the side issues of the
Titanic trouble was the fact that, though
there were plenty of stewards, cooks’ mates,
wasliers-up, bearers of afternoon tea, dish-
wallopers, deck-sweeps, coal-passers, brass
polishers, greasers, funnel-painters and other
artisans there were so few men who really
knew the sea that some of the boats had to
go away with potato-peelers or such folk in
charge.
“C.A.8.”: Judging by an article in the
S. M. Herald (16/5/’l2), the Government
means to start tuberculin dispensaries for
the treatment of consumption. The idea
emanated originally from Dr. Camac Wil-
kinson, then of Sydney. Chiefly owing to
the jealousy and conservatism of a number
of his confr&res, he failed. So he went to
.London and established dispensaries there.
It is a quaint circumstance that the success
of these London dispensaries is now being
cited as a reason for inaugurating the sys-
tem here, and by several of the identical
doctors who damned the idea fivfe years ago,
when it was a purely Australian idea.

Boulder (W.A.) City Council was con-
fronted with the Yellow Peril, the other
night, and was mightily impressed there-
with. A recommendation had been made by
the Works Committee that the Government
should be asked to amend the Health Act
in the direction of empowering local bodies;
to refuse licenses to Japanese laundries..
Generally the view taken was that “this was:
a far-reaching question,” and “that the time'
was not ripe.” One sanitary statesman:
said:—
He agreed that this was a far-reaching question,,
and interference on the part of the council might,
give rise to international complications. The Jap-
anese, further, were the allies of Great Britain, and',
after their admittance to the Commonwealth it;
would be an unjust practice to brand them as unde-
sirables, or in any way discriminate against them
by the means of hasty legislation. It was a far-
reaching question indeed, and he for one should not
like to take a thoughtless hand in the adoption of
the recommendation.
And the Council was so impressed with the
Sanitary diplomat’s solemn warning to do
nothing which would lead to the withdrawal
of the Japanese Ambassador from London,
that it hastily shelved the matter for a fort-
night. Thus narrowly are wars evaded.
That section of the community in Maori -
land which wastes its time arid ruins some-
of its nice girls in teaching Ah Sin the Ten:
Commandments and the Ten Thousand Pre-
cepts, occasionally obtains a glimpse of how
the good work progresses. The other day,
at Auckland, a party of police officers
rushed a collection of shanties known as the
Northern Club, and found Sin and the rest
of the family hard at work on pakapu, fan-
tan, dice, cards and other religious matters.
Among the arrested were “twenty who had
been to church and who are professed mem-
bers of the Christian Chinese community.”
Some little time ago, at Mastertop, a Chow
who was a shining light of the Scotchby-
terian variety, was sentenced to three years
for arson. His particular prayer depot
could have put up with that shock, perhaps,
if it hadn’t been knocked clean out by dis-
covering that its pet Pong had been, living
in adultery with a white man’s wife. :

Watch Bracelets
have superseded the long chains of
late fashion, and very fetching
they are.
Extremely handsome as Brace-
lets, sensible and useful as
Watches. They appeal to a
lady in these days of “no
pockets.”
To be of use, however, they
must be reliable works —an ordi-
nary movement will not stand
the constant jar of wear.
All our Watch Bracelets are
specially made for hard wear.
And they are not only rel'able,
but are profoundly accurate.

“Warrumbucca”: Have found that black
brother’s fatalistic beliefs can be overcome by judi-
cious treatment. A boundary-rider (full-blood) com-
plained to me last week that his leg was very bad.
His sister (dead 15 years) had come to him in a
dream and placed her hand oh his knee while he
slept. “No more good now,” said Jacky; “I die
plenty quick”—a belief which the other blacks shared
implicitly. I carefully examined the leg, and de-
clared it. sound as a limb could be, as it really was,
but Jacky was not to be comforted. Next day he
was hobbling on a crutch; the following day he took
to his blanket, and would not stir. I decided to give
Jacky a fitting send-off, so lined up his three darky
mates, two bottles of whisky being requisitioned for
the job. Of course Jacky was persuaded to have a
taste, and, after three good nips, he was once more
taking a slight interest in earthly affairs. Boori,
one of the other darkies, was proclaiming, as is his
custom after he has had a taste, that he was ready
and willing to fight any bloke that could be dug up ;
so I gave Jacky an extra stiff ’un, and whispered in-
sinuatingly: “Boori chucking off at you, Jacky.”
Jacky bounded out of his blanket, and for five minutes
the two black, squirming figures defied identification.
Jacky is riding his boundary again this week.
“Les”: At time of writing (6/5/T2)
myriads of caterpillars are swooping down on the
dairy farms a few miles from Beaudesert (Q.), and
swallowing everything before them, including fences.
The pest appeared in a mysterious manner, and de-
fies the most ancient inhabitant to recollect a similar
visit. The favorite dish of the curse is grass, and
the cow lord is in a terrible rage about it. Every
blade of the vegetable is required to see him
through the winter, and the horned goddess utterly
refuses to have anything to do with the bill of fare
after pa Caterpillar has dragged the missus and the
kids over it.

“Wal”: I would rise to remark that one
“Lodington” (B. 29/2/’l2), in his version of a
Papuan pig-butcher, is not correct in saying that the
porker’s life is extracted per medium of an axe. I
have, also, “travelled extensively amongst the moun-
tain tribes of Papua,” and can truthfully say that 99
out of every century of pigs get their ticket signed
with a spear. The method is brutal. The victim is
tied to a pole and slung on a couple of forked sticks
or between the posts of a house; a fire is made of
dry cocoanut leaves, and torches are used to re-
move the bristles, while the pig makes remarks on
the parentage of the operators at the top of his
voice. Then the happy child of nature with the spear
comes forward—an artist with the blood of a thou-
sand hogs waiting to rise up against him on Judg-
ment Day—and inserts the point of the' implement
under the left shoulder of the victim, who becomes
more violent than ever. The butcher then rests from
his labor and has a smoke, after which he jabs the
spear an inch or so deeper, giving it a gentle twist
that causes a flood of awful language from the un-
fortunate hog. More tobacco follows, then the spear
goes deeper until it enters the heart. For real, or-
ganised torture, the killing of a pig in this style is
hard to beat.

A cry from Emmaville (N.S.W.) : —The
drought has got this district fast in its grip.
Already Bourke’s Hill Mine and the No. 1 Britain are
closed down, and it is merely a question of a month
or so until the Y and the rest are in the same plight,
unless a heavy fall of rain occurs. The Y, it is
said, has almost come to the end of its water re-
sources by pumping from the Severn. No. 2 Britain
has probably a month’s water ahead by pumping.
Stuttridge’s has been pumping for months from the
abandoned Elsie workings at Tent Hill. Altogether,
the outlook is exceedingly gloomy. The oldest in-
habitant has never experienced such a water famine
in Emmaville, and it is feared the inhabitants will
have to take to beer, which is altogether against
their moral principles. The town depends mainly on
the tin racket, and if this collapses there are hard
times ahead. In fact, they are hard now for a
large portion of the community. With tin as high
as £l3O some of the buyers, I have been told, do
not average more than scwt. per week. And there
are not many buyers. The pastoralist outlook is even
more gloomy. Everyone who can is shifting his
stock. You could hardly give a horse away. Chaff
is £8 10s. per ton, if you can get it. Corn, 7s. 6d.
or more, when to be got.
A LARGE ORDER.
MANAGER (to playwright): “You touch up
plays, I understand—introduce new busi-
ness, and that sort of thing?”
PLAYWRIGHT : “Oh, yes!”
MANAGER: “Very well, I'm doing the smalls
next week with 'Hamlet,' and I want you
to re-write the play so as to bring in a
bushranger, a couple of blood-hounds and a
baby.”
“Leo Lear”: Re plugged-up gun-bores
and their relation to firearm explosions. You need
not go past Bananaland for insect masons that en-
danger life in this respect. It always pays to take
a glance through the barrel of your pistol or cannon
before you set out Too shooting on Sundays. It is
a favorite residential site for mason wasps, who plug
the aperture with mud, making the mass as hard as
the Salvation Army. Other localities much sought
after by the same beasts are pipe-bowls, keyholes and
boots. I have never been stung by a mason wasp,
but his cousin, who constructs a small, circular nest
suspended from wire, is boiling hot about the tail.
He is also a devil on rose foliage, and chews at the
leaves of your garden beauties until the bush re-
sembles a bunch of railway tickets punched every
league on a journey from Longreach to Oodnadatta.
But worst of all in the stinging line are the gentry
whose honeycombed nests, two or three feet long, are
attached to the bark of tall trees. Experts say
these beasts of prey are descendants of a direct cross
between Rehoboam’s scorpions and the thumb-screw.
A HINT.
THE BOSS (conversationally inclined): “What would you do if you struck first horse in
Tatl.'s, Pat?”
PAT (promptly): “Buy your woodheap a new axe.”
“Leo Lear” : Have just been toiling in one
of those “blackfellow’s ovens,” mentioned by “Mall-
arapoonie” (B. 25/4/’l2), and cannot agree with his
theory that they were formed by mud springs. These
mounds are often found on alluvial flats, where the
soil has been deposited long since Satan gave up
pushing his surplus products through the local bung-
holes. So, notwithstanding the unreliability of the
Oldest Inhabitants, I prefer to think that Black
Brother had a large say in the formation of the
ovens. The most ancient of the remnant of the Lake
Condah tribe informed me the ovens were in reality
mud houses, where a limited supply of Binghi shel-
tered from the Polar blasts of July. They were built
by leaning long sticks up against one another in the
form of a circle. Bark and leaves were then placed
on top, and earth heaped liberally over the whole
show. After. an age of years the wood rotted, or
was burnt, and the house collapsed. The decayed
wood and leaf mould would partly explain the pre-
sent richness of the oven soil. Petrified odor of in-
numerable Binghi accounts for the rest. A residence
that had fallen in was often used as a burial-ground.
I have often dug out skulls, bones, tomahawks, etc.,
when pursuing bunny to his basement floor in one of
these mounds. The “ovens” were not only used in
Western Victoria. They are also found in the north
of that State, and on certain islands in Bass Strait.

“Matrix”: Re “Mallarapoonie” (B.
2/5/’l2), on the deserted Peak Downs or Copper-
field (Queensland), I tear off a rag of history. Like
any other place of note the mine had its rival alleged
discoverers. But, at some more or less assured date,
specimens reached one Manton at Rockhampton. He
had a look at the show, and eventually went off to
Sydney and formed a company of 100,000 shares at
£1 per head. Two-thirds of the proceeds
( £66,666 13s. 4d.) went to the promoters, and the
balance was to develop the great wonder—at first
called the Eureka. Manton was appointed manager,
and in his report to the directors he spoke of “a lode
12yds. wide on the Surface,’ traceable for 1140yds.,
and opened to a depth of 4ft., said to contain 27,800
tons of 25 p.c. ore.” There was nothing small about
Manton. With copper at £95 a ton, the estimated
value of the mine to 4ft. was £660,250! ! And each
foot of sinking was to add to this. Raising the ore,
smelting, and cartage to the coast (300 miles away)
were supposed to cost £187,650, leaving a profit of
£472,600! And nobody asked questions. It was
a trustful period. The first ore was smelted in ’64,
and six furnaces were in blast by ’66. Dividends
totalling £215,250, were paid, one of them alone
being £lOO,OOO. It was this great effort that
caused all the trouble, for the money was paid out of
bank advances on blister copper in transit. But (so
the excuse goes) transit was tedious and slow, copper
values dropped down while the metal was wallowing
on tlje water, and the directors dropped in. Then
the reckless work started. To work off the decom-
posed" horse there followed a policy of picking the
eyes out of the mine; development was neglected,
and eventually the co. died. In much later days it
was thought to get money by precipitation from the
water ,so long standing in the mine, but when the old
water) was baled with some slight profit, the scheme
fell through. The new water was little better than
ordinary or drinkable fluid. As some evidence on
“Mallarapoonie’s” point that “there isn’t another
idle mine perishing under better auspices in the
State,” it may be stated that the Mount Morgan
people had an option over it, and after close exami-
nation, turned it down. Perhaps they thought that
perishment was all it was good for.
Apparently they take tlieir lunatics seri-
ously in the Cold Land. A Londoner lately handed
High Commissioner Reid an imposing document
dealing with the prickly-pear. Reid transmitted it to
the Prime Minister, who sent it to the State Pre-
mier, who handed it to the Minister of Agriculture,
who tossed it to the director, who looked into it.
The London genius proposes to eradicate the pear by
first boring a hole in the top of the plant, inserting
some salt, sulphate of copper and calcium carbide,
and then corking up the orifice and the mixture. The
plant’s juice or perspiration is to produce gas, and
the gas is to force the salt and copper sulphate down
into the plant and poison it. Alternately, he sug-
gests grafting the S’African rubber plant on to the
curse, so that it may grow a more tenacious, though
somewhat spiky, sort of rubber, very suitable for
motor tyres. Why does Yes-No waste the time of
highly-placed officials in forwarding humorous out-
bursts of this sort ? Hasn’t he got a dust-bin and a
chucker-out ?
THE ADC OF SCIENTIFIC FARMING.
Method of protecting the young crop from an

“Dinkum” : I want some reliable informa-
tion about the water-sensing propensities of cattle
and other animals. We ran short of the cheap drink-
able once in the Taylor Ranges (Q.), and were hard
pushed until we came upon a dry water-course. Dug
into the sand about two feet, and got a good supply.
It was cold as hail, and, after a little time, quite
clear. But before it had settled, one of the lady
bulls in the party came straight for it, and had to be
invited with a sapling to leave. She was followed
by others at regular intervals, and before we could
get the billy filled we had escorted a dozen off the
premises. That night the place was visited by
snakes, wallabies, dingoes and gohannas by the tram
load. Can animals smell water? We couldn’t; at
least, not before the beasts had a pull at the spring.
After that we could smell it three miles off.
THE DRUNRWICK RACES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Logan, who described his business as that of
a backer of horses and ponies, declared, “as a
backer,” in favor of the bookmaker. When, two
months ago, he went to a totalisator meeting at Taka-
puna, Auckland, he was astonished at the number
bf drunks on the course. The explanation was that
there was no excitement, and nothing to do except
to get drunk. — Naive item from Totalisator Commis-
sion report.
I wandered on the Drunkwick course;
It was the year the Tote came in:
I’d just gone out to back a horse,
Although I knew it was a Sin !
My conscience cut me like a kn'fe,
But —I’d been sinning all my life.
And so the fight was not severe,
Or very long; nor great the cost;
Let it suffice if I make clear
The painful fact that Conscience lost.
Ye5....1 was there in hope to win—
It was the year the Tote came in !
I noticed, as I walked about,
That deadly silence seemed to reign ;
The old-time, joyous Hebrew shout
I yearned to hear —and yearned in vain....
“Oh, woeful day! Ah, me!” I said;
“For me the joy of life is fled.”
The Drunkwick Racecourse, long ago,
Had been a garden of delight!....
Now, all the Ikes I used to know
Were vanished from my tear-dimmed sight;
A secret sorrow seemed to dwell
About the spot they loved so well!
Gone were the graceful, god-like shapes
That thronged the Drunkwick sward of yore—
Gone the pure faces, bunched like grapes,
With > shining virtue running o’er —
The melting eye, the kindly smile,
Were gone 1.. . .1 paused and wept awhile
Nay, sneer not, gentle reader mine!
Have you not known the force of woe?
Sorrow is sacred —half-divine!—
Can one rejoice when old friends go ?
Can you restrain the starting tear
When noble spirits leave this sphere?
Enough! I tore me from the scene....
E’en as I turned, I there beheld
A great, grim, noiseless, new Machine
Which did not sweat-—-and never yelled—-
Or on the fallen ’chaser gloat—
Or curse the winners ! ’Twas The Tote 1
With trembling hand I risked my pound
On that dark horse, the Rising Sun. ...
And then, in silence most profound,
We watched the race — and my horse won !..
Some thirty pounds did I collect—
A price which I did not expect!
There was small gladness in the place....
The silence got upon my nerves.
I won, upon the second raee,
Nine pounds odd, if my memory serves;
It seemed a profitable game,
But ah! it was so sad and tame!
The cold, hard persons in the Tote
Just flung my winnings coldly down!
And, as I checked each five-pound note
I missed the old, familiar frown —
The pleasant oath, the playful curse,
Old Mo gave forth at each reverse!
I missed the friendly, old disputes—•
The jocund snarls that used to be....
The people mooned about like mutes —
I said: “This is no good to me !
This is too easy—one can’t lose!
I’ll go and have a good old booze !”
The same thought seemed to strike the
crowd,
We all moved off towards the bar !
And there we liquored long and loud —
You know how thirsty some thirsts are!
As there was no excitement near,
We sought it (naturally) in Beer!
I never saw so many drunks!
The Tote itself began to reel!
The horse-boxes were used as bunks,
Where squiffy blokes could lie and squeal!. ...
I said: “Thish■ — hit I—-’sh1 — -’sh a ’shgraceshful sheene !
’Sh all the fauttsh tha’ dam—hie ! — M’schine !”
I saw, of course, what all must see—
This fact, quite easy of belief ;
That, once the hind, old “bookies” flee,
The Public will get drunk for grief!
And, since then, I have never been
To Drunkwick, with its vile Machine!

“Isaac Gumboil,” J.P., seeks enlighten-

“H. Ilorsecollar” Esq.’s item on octopuses (B.
25,/4/’l2) leads me to believe him somewhat expert
in certain branches of the fish (including Stinking
Fish) department, and I fain would have his assist-
ance in identifying a strange sea insect that I dis-
covered whilst fishing off the east coast of Australia
with my aunt Becky and some green prawns. It
looked like a limp, lifeless, three-inch square of per-
ished rubber, or a Wowser's soul or something equally
sodden. Soon it appeared to be making some head-
way against the current, and left an almost impercep-
tible ripple in its wake ; so I concluded it was alive.
I reached forward with a piece of board, intending
to steal under it, undermine its moral support, then
send it hurtling into the boat. Alas! when a foot
within reach, to my polite amazement it unfurled a
pair of wings, rose into the atmosphere, flapped along
a few feet beyond reach, then dropped, and before
I could cut the cable or lower away the lifeboat it
had escaped. The last I saw of it, it was heading
for Torres Strait.

“George Street” : The discovery of a pre-
h’storic man in Britain, a man who has been lying
dead where he fell through countless ages, would not
have created so much interest if it had not been
for the fact that the skeleton was wearing at the time
of his death what was practically proved to be a
20th century skull. The ancient person gave up
living before the Glacial Period, and is conse-
quently much older than Freetrade, and the House of
Lords, and probably, if the subject was capable of
investigation, a good deal older than the Devil. The
discovery is not one to fill us with enthusiasm. If
it has taken man with a full brain all this long
time to get where he is, how long is it going to
take him to get anywhere else that is worth while?
There are a lot of lessons to be derived from that
old person who once wore his hat over a sufficiency
of misused brains, but the first and clearest is that
a race which Nature took millions of years to de-
velop may give place to a second-rate article through
its own indifference to its own ex'stence. The
race inhabiting the land of the Ancient Britons imme-

diately after the Glacial Period has left a few
bones lying about also, and it is well known that it
wasn’t much better in type than some of the black-
and-tan peoples that Bruce Smith and his friends
would like to introduce into Australia to-day. So
apparently the man with the large head had some
very, poor successors. Exactly how he fooled away
his chance isn’t known.

Dear Bulletin.— The technicalities of
“Wal” (B. 9/5/’l2) make me tired. What matters
it if Papuan houses are floored with bamboo, as
“Mallarapoonie" said they were, or with split palm,'
or mangrove poles, as “Wal”
says they are? As a matter
of fact, there are more than
two or four, or six or 11
houses in Papua, and some
are floored with bamboo, and
some with mangrove poles,
and some with slabs, and
some with split palm, and
some with just ordinary
wooden or tree timber.
Others again aren’t floored at
all, affecting rather the
naked earth. But, sooner
than not have any floors in
Papuan houses, and to avoid
frivolous argument in con-
nection with them, we will
have the lot done in polished
silky-oak if “Wal” will ■ bear
the cost. As for dogs not ,
being kicked in Papuan vil-
lages, I may say there are
many villages, and great and
varied is the brand of mong.
in Papua. “Wal” and “Mall-
arapoonie” may not be allud-
ing to the same Papuan
villages or to the same dogs,
hence the utter futility of
“Wal’s” disputation on the
subject. Further than this,
I may say I have booted
Papuan dogs regardless of
their value, off villages and
elevated houses, with my own
large hoof. Also, I have given
orders to have them booted off,
and seen that such orders Were
obeyed. I have, in fact, person-
ally supervised the booting off
of dogs. In setting out to raise
a controversy, “Wal” seems to
assume that the Papuan he knows
is the whole Papuan, and the
Papuan house he knows is the
only houses and the dog he knows
is the entire, complete, bound-
less, unlimited, finished, ultimate
dog of the globe. But beyond
the uttermost fringe of the dog he knows may lie
the dog I know, and it may he a wholly different
dog, and my dog may in every way controvert and
extinguish his dog, and thus raise a new dog-issue
which he has not considered. Speaking as a dog-
kicker of some experience, I ask “Wal” to think
bitterly over these points at the top of his voice.—•

“At first my boy was attacked with a bad cold
in the chest and throat, which threatened to be a
bad case of diphtheria,” writes Mrs. Burnham,
William Street, Lutwyche (Q.). “After trying

berlain’s Cough Remedy, and I must say I certainly
would have .lost my bov if I had not used it, for he
was on the verge of diphtheria.”*
“Hobs of Hades”: If “Tamumu” (B.
4/4/’l2) wants to experience a bit of the dreary side
of station life, let him come to Queensland and take
on boundary riding. The dreariness of the life is
awful, especially if you are camped out with nothing
but your dog to swear at. If a man were getting
£2 a week, and all the plain and wholesome food,
etc., it would take the whole of his wage to buy
reading matter to keep his brain balanced. Day in
and day out he turns out at dawn, catches his
horse, and eats a bit of damper and mutton. Then
he does the lizard act along a fence, and pulls up at
water by noon, boils his quart pot, and has a drink
of tea to wash down the bit of dry brownie. Next,
a shady tree and a sleep ,(if the ants are agreeable)
for a couple of hours. Later, back to the hut.
After supper (more mutton and damper) the boundary
rider lights a stinking slush lamp, and forages around
amongst the old papers to see if there is anything he
has missed reading 10 times backwards, or else he
puts a patch on the keel of his pants; or pastes news-
paper over a crack in the wall of the hut to kill
time and keep draughts out; ' or reckons up
how much money he has coming. This doesn’t
take long, and about 9 p.m. he turns in,
but he doesn’t trouble to put on his 1 py-
jamas, or see if the sheets have been aired. He
just ■ rolls himself up in bis blanket and goes to
sleep, or remains awake. Unfortunately, he can’t do
both at the same time, or the night would be more
interesting. In fact, the life is a fair cow. No
good dragging in Maoriland stations. If they were
all lumped together, an Australian boundary rider
couldn’t get lonely if he tried. They are merely
cockies’ selections, with a pub and a picture show
within short l’ve been there.

do not light numbers of them in any way, not even
at the end. At Denial Bay, the other night, the
steamer Rupara was guided in by the local agent
of the Adelaide Steamship Company, who stood on
the jetty and lighted matches at intervals. Passen-
gers, horses, sheep, cattle and goods from the holds
are dumpe'd out in a jumbled mass, and get to the
shore as best they can, while embarking passengers
and stock are also coming from the shore, for
steamers get away as soon as possible. Horses and
sheep tumble over the side very often in the dark-
ness, and humans have to walk warily to escape a
similar fate. In the 300 miles from Cape Borda to
Denial Bay, along the West Coast, where many reefs
and other dangers exist, there is not a single light
of any kind, and no beacon visible at night. Cap-
tains have just to feel their way.
“Boswell”: The Tweed (N.S.W.) Shire
Council has of late shouted very earnestly about the
necessity for exterminating the lantana. Arsenical
spraying was tried at one time, but, as it slew cows
as well as vegetation, it was abandoned. Since then
nothing has been done so far as I am aware. I
know one mansion that is surrounded by lantana.
The vegetable is climbing over it like an advancing
army of green apes. Lantana cumbers the soil all
round. There is only one narrow track for entrance
and exit, and the owner has to fight for possession
of that. And the inmate of the premises is a shire
councillor.
When you’ve been talking all day in a stuffy room
it usually results in a headache. It needn’t last but
a few minutes. Stearns’ Headache Cure relieves it.*
“Ben Telbow” writes :—-
We have just formed the “Freedom League of
Asstraitor,” and we earnestly exhort your entire staff,
from Printer’s Mephistopheles to Religious Editor, to
join without delay. We stand for freedom, and our
primary object is to strike off our most recently added
shackle, to mock and set at nought the pernicious
’ Conscription Act, which defiles the fair face of our
Statute Book, and incites our carefully nurtured sons
to acts of violence and legalised murder. Our method
is to encourage cadets to defy their officers, and so
bring the /aw into ridicule, and to assist martyrs on
the Sacred Altar of Liberty, by paying their fines for
them.
But, sir, we have other aims. Our motto is:
“Trust the people. Give them back their liberty.’
In the name of the people (meaning US), we insist
upon the repeal of the compulsory clauses in all
taxation Acts. A voluntary subscription is worth
three unsatisfied judgment summonses, and the cost
of government could easily be defrayed by means of
unlocked subscription boxes, placed conveniently at
street corners, and bearing the legend, “Remember
the Poor Government,” or words to that effect. Trust
the people! Look at the overflowing treasuries of
the voluntary subscription hospitals, and have no fear
for thv salary, O trembling M.P. Bills for the
abolition of locks and window catches and disband-
ment of the police are in the forefront of our pro-
gramme, and we would make attendance at reforma-
tories, prisons and lunatic asylums purely voluntary.
The prnciple of freeboard, enjoyed for so long m
our mercantile marine, we would extend to hotels,
restaurants, fish joints and hash towers. In the
words of the poet:—
“We want free life and we want free air.”
Also, free trams, free clothes, free love, free work
and free beer. But we don't insist upon free love ;
and, in any case, let us remember that, like free
work, it will be purely voluntary. You see we are a
genuine freedom league, formed to throv* off the
handcuffs and leg-irons of a civilisation founded upon
the confiscation of the sacred rights of the individual.
Our members are all right thinking people, and we
have nothing to do with anarchists, I.W.W. people,
dynamiters or counter-lunchers.
“Radium” : The Bulletin remarks
(25/4/’l2) that it has “A profound disre-
spect for the conscientious scruple which
throws a double job on to some other man.”
So have we all. But it is the law of the
land which is really responsible for the
double-banking iniquity. Clause bl of the
Defence Act says that the Governor-General
may by regulation declare what persons shall
be exempt from military service “provided
that persons whom the doctrines of their
religion forbid to bear arms or perform mili-
tary service shall be exempt upon such con-
ditions as may be prescribed.” This provi-
sion is a direct incentive to those who, be-
cause they happen to be cranks, or bad
patriots, or what not, are desirous of dodging
the business of defending their country, to
develop “conscientious scruples” as a means
of claiming immunity from service. Thus it
would be quite feasible for “Comrade”
Goatte (say) to invent a new religion em-
bodying amongst its doctrines the Quaker
idea of non-resistance to assault, while
leaving everything else so indefinite that all
objectors to compulsory service could join
it. That would deal the Defence scheme a
truly staggering biff. In addition to people
with conscientious scruples priests, parsons
and even “theological students” and also
members of Parliament are exempt from ser-
vice or training under the Act as it stands.
The principle is rotten. If there is trouble
the reljgious objectors and the clergy and
their theological apprentices, and the wives
and families of all these classes will yell as
loudly for help at the first prod of the in-
vading bayonet as any pagan. Everyone
should be made to learn to defend the
country just as everyone is now legally forced
to do various other things for the welfare
of the community : and Australia’s Defence
system can never be wholly effective till the
Act is amended. If a man’s religious
scruples are so bad that he can’t fight in
defence of his home then I guess they must
be so bad that he can’t pay anyone else to
fight. If the Act wants to be consistent it
should either make him do his military or
naval drill or else let him off his military
and naval taxes.

London Express :
CONCERNING TRADE RETURNS.
Sir, —An English firm borrowed some old printing
blocks from a firm in Sweden, made use of and re-
turned them, being obliged in order to do so to fill
up a Customs declaration form, specifying their value,
etc.
More British exports!
The same goods entered this country, of course,
as imports. Good ! Put them down in the trade re-
turns. Add the import and export values, and you
get—statistics of trade!
There was no trade at all, not a penny earned on
either side.
No doubt many of your readers can give from
their experience other instances of fallacies in those
trade returns so venerated by Freetraders.

FREETRADE AND NO WORK.
Sir, —Being out of employment, I am free to walk
about, so one day last week I took a walk round
the free park. I had a drink of water from a free
fountain. I went to the free library and had a free
look at the Daily News, where I saw the splendid
figures of our increase in trade.
I have been out of work for four months, and
although I have answered every advertisement where
I felt I could give my hoped-for employer fair value
for his pay, and have been registered at the Labor
‘Exchange for six weeks, I have not yet had a single
answer.
I am debating in my mind, if I do earn another
penny, how I shall augment the Freetrade figures—-
by buying a penny loaf made from flour imported
free from America, and so prolonging the agony; or
by buying a Freetrade looking-glass from Germany
and watching myself starve.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh i I dwelt in a shadowland mystic.
In dark hills afar and unseen.
And the moon shone in peace on a trickle
The mist-muffled ridges between.
A musical trickle that murmured
Through shades intermingled and cool.
From the soft, drowsy greenness outslanted
O’er boulder-strewn shallow and pool.
The long spurs slid down from the mountain,
Gaunt, haggard and ghostly. They drank,
And straightway bloomed out on the river
Wild brushland and moss-covered bank.
So, dreaming, I wandered in Eden
Till the stars in the East faded out,
And I woke to the old, stunted gum-trees,
The white heaps of bones and the drought.

According to a recent Age statement:
“There has been living in Ballarat for many
years an old soldier named William Crow-
ley, who was engaged in the American War
of Independence.” It was commonly sup-
posed that the last Waterloo veteran blew
out years and years ago, and behold ! there
turns up a man who was fighting under
Israel Putnaifi and Washington and Greene
and Gates 40 years before Waterloo was
heard of. If lie was even 20 years old when
he humped his musket in that buried scrum
of the century before last he would be nearly
100 in the Indian Mutiny days, and they
didn’t happen yesterday.
D. S. K. Miller, who has been appointed
manager of the Commonwealth Bank, is to
get £4OOO a year for seven years. The Gov-
ernment had £3OOO on offer ; but most private
banks have pension funds, and it needed the
other £lOOO to induce a first-class man to
pass out into a cold place with no pension
prospects to warm it. Miller, who is just
past the half-century, has for years past
been at the right hand of general manager
Russell French, of the Bank of N. S. Wales;
and as that potentate hasn’t time to fool
around at social functions, or decorate any
public shivoo, “Denny” Miller, as “general
manager’s assistant,” has had to do the job.
The B.N.S.W. gave him a good salary to
do it on, and, while he was doing it, you
could have sworn he was born in a duke’s
palace at the very least; whereas, in fact; he
was born in a small N.S.W. country school-
building. Still, he wasn’t merely decora ive,
and if Russell French knows how to general-
manage a bank, Denison Miller by this time
probably knows it too.
THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION

tely, prospects for the winter were very bad indeed.

had a 94th birthday last week; and inquir-
ing pressmen found him in his office, hard at
work on a catalogue of his pet “York Gate”
library, which cultured Adelaide has bought
and imported whole from London.

Probably the oldest medical man in Aus-

old, and has been drawing a pension from

surgeon-major, for a good proportion of that
time. A few months ago he broke his thigh,
and the doctors feared that that wou’d be
the end of him, but he has made a marvel-
lous recovery, and is now able to get about
on crutches. Soon he is to walk again. He

butts once a year, to get his marksman’s
badge. This year, under th° Defence De-
partment’s new shooting conditions, he onlv
managed to , pull through; but to even
pull through when the man behind the gun is
past 80 is a pretty fair excuse for giving
three cheers.
ALEXANDER,
Of the firm of
Chapman and
Alexander (as he
struck a S.A.
artist).
By The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant
Reminiscences of Alexander Berry have just been
published by the widow of John Hay, who, under
certain conditions, inherited the immense Berry
estates. Alexander Berry first struck Sydney in
January, 1808, when he came as supercargo of his
own ship, the City of Edinburgh, witn a large cargo
op wines and spirits. Then he encountered Governor
Bligh, who sent for him and sought to obtain the
substance of any conversation which he had with
John . Macarthur and others, who were antagonistic
to Bligh. There was an informal cross-examination
at Government House, at which Judge Advocate
Atkins was present. Eventually Berry was peremp-
torily ordered to store his wines and spirits with
Robert Campbell, of the wharf, who was not only a
trader, but was Naval Officer (practically Collector
of Customs). Berry left his cargo to be disposed
of by Simeon Lord, who subsequently paid him by
bills on London. He then entered into a contract
with the Lieutenant-Governor —Bligh having been
deposed—-to transfer all the inhabitants of Norfolk
Island, free and bond, to Hobart Town, the Im-
perial Government having determined to evacuate the
island. Eventually Berry sailed for Maoriland for a
cargo of spars,, and when loading heard of the seizure
of the Boyd,, from . Sydney, which had put into
Whangaroa,’ and the massacre of crew and passengers,
with the .exception of a woman, two female children
and a boy. These Berry rescued. One of the chil-
dern was Betsy, daughter of Commissary Broughton,
who, in course of time, became the wife of Charles
Throsby, of Throsby Park. The old lady—she was
86 at her death —sleeps in the quaint little rural
cemetery attached to the old church at Bong Bong.
Berry met his future brother-in-law, Edward Wool-
stonecraft —so spelled by himself—on The Tagus.
They came to Sydney together in ,1819. Prospects
were so good that Berry hastened again to London to
enlarge his connection. When he returned he found
that Woolstonecraft had secured a grant of 500 acres
at North Shore from Governor Macquarie, on
which he built a cottage which he called “The
Crow’s Nest,” from the altitude of the place. This
historic cottage and site John Hay presented to the
Presbyterian body, and a church is now on the
spot. It is understood that Macquarie offered Wool-
stonecraft a big slice of Woolioomooloo, but the
Englishman selected the North Shore as being more
healthy. Macquarie then gave the partners grants of
2000 acres each at Shoalhaven. While in London,
Berry heard of the appointment of Brisbane as Gov-
ernor, and immediately offered to convey him and
his family to Port Jackson, at a price, no doubt.
His offer was accepted, and he chartered the Royal
George for the purpose. On the arrival of Bris-
bane, Berry and Woolstonecraft offered to take and
maintain 100 convicts, on condition that they got a
grant of 10,000 acres at Shoalhaven. Brisbane
jumped at the offer, and the foundation of the fortunes
of Alexander Berry was laid. Berry speaks very
bitterly of attempts made by Dr. Lang to injure him
in his holdings at Shoalhaven. The Doctor
preached against Berry, and “made his tenants
dissatisfied.” Berry fathers the exploded slander that
Bligh hid under 'll feather bed when the soldiers
invaded Government House to arrest him, and alleges
that there were fluff and hens’ feathers on the
Glorious British uniform.
A STL END ID UPHEAVAL.
At "a meeting of strikers one speaker expressed
the opinion that any unionist who purchased beer
from the publicans during the strike was a scab.
—News item, from Port P[?] (S.A.).
BEER STRIKER (a syndicalist): “A penny a
pint off that beer , Mister Bung, or by 12
o'clock to-morrow Jive undred millyun
thousand men drops their tools.”
An extract from a recent printed bellow
by Inclement Wragge, the man who didn’t
get the Federal Meteorologist’s billet, and
who is still nagging at H. A. Hunt, the man
who did get it:—
If Mr. Hunt would forecast Australian seasons, as
the man can who knows how. . .his body may rest
in his office chair, but his mind must be tossed
midst the seething photosphere, and his spirit must
play with the hydrogen flames and the corona; of the
sun. . . Fiat lux! Meantime the drought will con-
tinue.
Wragge’s word-picture conveys a vague idea
of a blazing meteorologist prophesying about
the weather, amid flames 90ft. high. If
Wragge ran his office- —in the days when he
had an office —after this combustible fashion,
one can understand why he is no longer in
the Government service. His presence viti-
ated the fire insurance policy.
Vice-Admiral King-Hall was made a full
Admiral last week, and, at the tail-end of
the period, the Drake undertook the lengthy
job of saluting his new flag. On Wednes-
day the millinery was flying at the flagship’s
masthead; but that was purely an informal
flutter, and on Thursday the business had to
be done officially. First, the old Vice-Ad-
miral’s flag was resurrected and hoisted, and
the new flag pulled down. Then the new
flag was rowed across to H.M.S. Psyche,
which, was leaning wearily against Garden
Island, whereupon the Drake proceeded to
make an expensive noise' about it. After
that the trimmings were removed from the
ship that was leaning against the island,
carted back to the Drake, and hauled up
there for good.
Reuben Keirl, said to have been one of
the classic acquaintances of the late T. Bent,
drifts into the limelight again. A while ago
Reuben and his missus aired their differ-
ences in a Melbourne court, and Reub
emerged from the argument with little im-
provement in his reputation. Subsequently
an inoffensive youth was mistaken for Reub,
and was sTushed by an outraged gent, on a
railway platform. The old person had to
pav much cash with costs for his thoughtless
violence, but he said enough to leave an
impression that he didn’t like Keirl. Doubt-
less even the latter now realises that his re-
nown has paled since the days when he was
the pet of the defunct Bent.
Big, rufous Bowes Kelly has got out of
the chair of Mount Lyell, the Common-
wealth’s biggest copper co., after sitting in
it for 20 years, during which he has pro-
posed dividends totting up to a trifle over
two and a half millions. With his big, red
brothers, Bowes Kelly was something finan-
cially small in a sheep-and-saltbush way, in
the Far West of N.S.W., when Broken Hill
gave him and the other squatters a lift; and
Wm. Orr and Schlapp later on smelt out
Mount Lyell for them. While the Wilsons
and the Brodribbs and some of the others
were pouring their little bit out on the turf
and elsewhere, Kelly stuck to his job of mak-
ing a trifle more, and is probably now the
richest of the Australian mining clan.
“Chasuble” about Mrs. Chapzander:—
Somebody writes about the rich wives of Chapman
and Alexander. I don’t think Mrs. Chapman is rich ;
but Chap, himself is warm; Millionaire Converse
left him £30,000. He was a widower, with a
grown-up son and daughter, when he married last
year. Mrs. Alexander is very rich; she came into
the whole property of her father, one of the Cad-
bury brothers, of Birmingham. Since her marriage
her mother died in tropical seas, through falling
down a companion-way. The family mansion, Uff-
culme, near Birmingham, has been re-christened by
Alexander, the captor, as Tennessee, after his south-
ern State. They excuse Alexander by saying that he
did not know who the lady was when he fell in love
with her. Sniff ! When Grattan Guinness was in Mel-
bourne, Joe Symes had a picture of him in the
Liberator, as a monkey playing a cornet (he used
to tootle this machine). A member of the Y.M.C.A.
wrote to the Southern Cross: “Contrast Mr. Guin-
ness with Mr. Symes ! Mr. Guinness is always smil-
ing and happy. Mr. Symes always looks miser-
able.” Whereupon Symes: “Yes! I am like Jesus,
a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. I un-
derstand Dr. Guinness is going to marry a young
lady with £20,000. If I was I would be smiling
and happy, too.” Poor old Joe! No twenty thou-
sand farthings came his way.
In terror lest
the Com m o n-
wealth might
claim the heavens,
the liard-up Ma
State Government
appointed an offi-
cial astronomer
the other day at
a salary of £BOO a
year and quarters.
The applications
for the job were
examined by an
English commit-
tee which upper-
cut the Austra-
lian stinking-fish
party by choosing
W. E. Cooke, of
the Perth Obser-
vatory. Ernest
Cooke was a bril-
-1 i a n t Adelaide
youngster who
won a S. Aus.
Government travelling scholarship during
the few years when that fairly rich prize was
offered, but turned it down to go into the
local star-gazing business under Charles
Todd —the astonishing old gentleman who
was Postmaster-General, Superintendent of
Telegraphs, Meteorologist, Government As-
tronomer, and chief punster all at once.
While he was assistant in the local Observa-
tory Cooke took his M.A. degree, and then
in 1895, when Westralia became suddenly
affluent, he was invited to Perth to organise
and run an Observatory there. He is 48
now, and is probably as good a mathemati-
cian as there is in the business.
About a favorite mummeress:—
Florence Young’s marriage, 15 years ago, to a
party named Rivington, has been restored to public
recollection by the husband’s petition for a divorce.
He tells the old familiar story of the remittance gen-
tleman who induces a self-supporting actress to be-
come his bride. They lived together at various hotels
in Melbourne, ere proceeding to London, where they
lived at some more hotels. The lady got one profes-
sional engagement in London. She got an engage-
ment in S’Africa, and took her husband to look on
whilst she fulfilled it. Then back to England and
back to Melbourne. In Melbourne, in 1901, she
settled down again to her work as a self-supporting
actress, and after a year pr so, the company of her
not very helpful husband was tiresome to her. She
lived apart from him, without giving him the un-
compromising “chuck.” Finally she “chucked” him
altogether, hence his suit for a decree nisi, on the
ground of desertion. The foolishness of this marriage
was mostly on the wife’s side. She possibly thought
she was making “a good match,” in the financial sense
of the term, whereas it was good only from Riving-
ton’s point of view. He captured the actress he
coveted, but she secured a Johnnie who neither
made it worth her while to retire into private life
nor put her into theatrical management on their own
account. Successful stage ladies who make that
mistake have long ceased to be matters for astonish-
ment in journalistic circles. The stage is a school
where women learn pretty well everything, except
wisdom in matrimonial speculation. A girl behind
the hotel bar is hardly a more misguided match-
maker than the actress who chooses a husband from
her admirers in the front stalls.

THE MINISTER FOR LABOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Weary, having been proved almost too
tired to live, has resigned the Premiership of Vic-
toria, and been created Minister for Labor.
The people tried in many ways
To make him serve the nation ;
He softly passed his working days
In peaceful meditation.
No zeal in him occasioned dread,
There was no need to curb him ;
Whene’er his native country sped
To call on him he was in bed,
And no one must disturb him.
She gave to him the highest post,
With languid spine he shone it,
And when she needed him the most
She found him leaning on it.
What work might come it was his whim
To fasten on his neighbor.
So now with sheer disgust made grim
They’ve seized upon and branded him
As Minister of Labor.
Thus Lib’ralism makes it clear
It’s Fat no man may flurry,
Entrenching him with nought to fear,
Behind this drifting Murray.
Labor may dress itself in black,

The bigger an insurance office gets the easier it is
for it to get bigger still, provided nothing unpleasant
happens such as happened a while ago to the swollen
American offices. This Colonial Mutual isn’t so big
as it might be, and it isn’t fashionable. Almost everv
Jt / ets it , has t 0 fi & ht for i very few flow
bodv 4 0rce °V family habit or because some-
body who isn t a paid canvasser has been overheard
barracking for it. Also it made mistakes at the time
of the big land boom, 20-odd years ago. Other and
bigger offices probably made very bad mistakes" to™
but they could hide them behind their bulk, while
this leaner concern couldn’t. Further, until a very
vTu. y ® ar - s bach, there didn’t seem much enter-
prise behind the counter. There wasn’t much of a
stream of new policy-holders coming in, so the bulk
concern was old and doddering, and that sort
of bulk naturally got the same sort of management.
,™L n men somehow got charge, and things
r e f a ? to „ ha PP® n - Among them the office decided to
t!3?, I? ■ i f ,rdlnar y business by pushing the
Industrial. But it was only climbing through the
when ° th f r c 9 ncerns ha<J ploughed half the
paddock, so after looking round it decided to buy a
ready-made business, and it got one, the Standard’s,
and paid a very stiff price for it. A much more
vigorous canvass for new business was started in
Australia, and that and the good times between them
have sent the income up with a jerk. In 1909 the
new-premium revenue was £47,510; last year it
was £105,012. That means a hustle somewhere,
f °2f. wa y ’ no doubt, the policy-holders have to pay
lor this. New business costs money, and the bigger
lt if, ln Proportion to total income the smaller the
Pii J b e > as a rule. For instance, assuming
that it costs 7 p.c. of the premiums to manage this
offices old business and 3 p.c. to do the annuity
business, then the new business last year cost 135
p.c. of the new-business premiums. On that basis
of reckoning, it actually cost the office a third more
than the first year’s premiums to get the new poli-
cies and manage them for the year. No doubt this
is chiefly why the old system of annual bonus pay-
ments has been hung up for a time. The actuary
finds a surplus of . £149,731, but “in the best in-
terests of the society” he recommends that there
shall be no distribution until 1913. And the actuary
is right. The drought is here, and the bursting of
the borrowing boom isn’t far off, and behind it is
the slump ; and nobody knows just how a slump is
going to hit him. This office has total assets of
nearly 3 5 millions, and it hasn’t got any deprecia-
tion fund whatever; consequently it was a wise
actuary as well as a plucky one who said, “No bonuses
for three years.” If the money isn’t called for to
make good a depreciation of securities, it will be
there at the end of the three years. If depreciation
has to be made good, it will have to be made good
whether a bonus is declared or not. The Bulletin
consequently lifts the office up a peg. Security is
the first consideration in life insurance; and the post-
ponement of the bonus shows that the management
recognises it.
Expenses have been very heavy. This shows the
rate on one basis:—
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1902 ..£lB 17 5 p.c. 1907 ..£22 3 2 p.c.
1903 .. 19 19 10 „ 1908 . . 20 210 „
1904 .. 20 18 7 „ 1909 .. 18 0 7 „
1905 .. 21 17 10 „ 1910 .. 20 16 4 „
1906 .. 22 8 8 „ 1911 .. 26 16 8 „
But, as hinted before, nearly everything depends on
the vigor with which new business is pursued. A
toothless old gentleman could probably do the job
for 7 p.c. if he merely sat in the office and collected
the premiums on as much of the old business as
didn’t drift away. By one method of reckoning it
has been already figured out that last year’s new
business cost 135 p.c. In 1906, though the expenses
compared with total income were much smaller, the
new business by the same method of reckoning cost
173 p.c. In other words, the increase in the figures
in the last table is due solely to the bigger propor-
tion of new business got recently; and either that
business or the old business has really cost
a great deal less. Still there is room for
a lot of improvement yet. When the new-
business rate has been brought down to 90 p.c.,
the office will be just about entitled to take 2min.
off and buy itself a drink. Until that happens,
policy-holders are not going to be overwhelmed with
bonuses from this source.
And though things are improving, policy-holders
are not likely to get very fat on bonuses earned
through big interest receipts. This is the recent
record: —-

Freeholds and leaseholds represent over one-fourth of
the total funds; and these are, as a rule, a depress-
ing item in an insurance co.’s accounts. Usually the
money has been sunk in office premises, which bring
in about 2 p.c., or in sick securities which have had
at last to be foreclosed. And on the figures there
hasn’t been much improvement in the 10 years.

This n „ P r b l P T ° ut of the depositors,

troubled with the uncomfortable conviction that the
aid re that P thi J" 8 ?" tended t 0 Protect the deposits!
and that the depositors had a right to a good deal
of consideration. Consequently the directors offered
the depositors as much as U p.c interest on the
locked up money ; and in view, of that sizeable re-
tur? ij lere , naturally wasn’t much of a rush to con-

taL Of close upon £4,750,000 of fixed deposits in
the early 90s, only £171,930 was exchanged for a
fixed interest in the reconstructed concern. This was
regarded as rather a slap in the eye at the time but

banks have been loaded up with more capital than

d ?f e re"oe— it couW pay off the unconverted
deposits if it had the cash and couldn’t use it to
advantage, whereas pref. capital isn’t to be got rid
Jv that handy fashion. For a while, of course
the .4* p.c. interest was a heavy drag, because most
f A^ as re P r ,esented by assets which had slumped
and _ had ceased to be worth 20s. in the £, and a
good many of the properties were bringing in no
return at all; hence the ordinaries got no div. for
a good many years, and even now they are getting
only 5 p.c. Prefs., however, get 7 p.c. ; but there
is a special reason for paying them more than the
ordinaries. When the concern was reconstructed
prefs. were offered 5J p.c., with a right to a further
division of the profits; but in return for this right
they agreed to leave off being prefs., so far as divi-
dends are concerned, when they had got five divs of
7 p.c. or more. This is the second 7 p.c. ; so in
three years, if this rate can be kept up, the pref
shares will be entitled to step in ahead of the others
only in case of liquidation.
The turn of the tide helped this bank wonderfully.
1 irst of all, it had a heap of dead or water-logged
assets on hand. As values improved rapidly it was
able to get rid of these securities, and with the pro-
ceeds pay off old debt carrying a burdensome 41
p.c. interest. In June, 1894, the old deposits stood
at £4,744,766 ; five years later they were down to

As the bank paid off old 41 p.c. deposits, it appar-
ently got a lot of the money back at 1 or 11 p c
u®T° r lf i<: . didn,t £ et that money it got some other
which was just as good. This shows how things
have gone m 10 years:—

The deposits, new and old, are in the aggregate
£1 ’ 194 > 177 greater than they were 10 years ago
while the advances are only £308,569 more. Prac-
tically all the balance is represented by increased
liquid assets. This has strengthened the bank
though no doubt it needs a bigger proportion of
liquid reserves now, having more current account
money. The 10 years’ growth of advances doesn’t
look very cheerful from the outside. From the in-
side, though, it probably looks better, inasmuch as
the £4,065,454 of 1901 pretty certainly included a
lot of stuff that the management would have been
glad to get rid of at a few shillings in the £. True
the £4,374,023 of to-day may also include a lot
of stuff that the management a few years hence may
be glad to get rid of_ at a sacrifice ; but that’s all a part
of the banking business in a droughty country, which
has been too busy borrowing and talking about its
great natural resources to do two lots of necessary
damming—one to keep the little rain that does fall
from flowing into the sea; the other to keep the sea
from bringing in the foreigners’ manufactured iron
and wool and other goods.
The figures for the 12 months show better how old
assets have been got rid ox and new ones have taken
their place:—

Ca P ita } amounts to £548,227 ; and, apart from the
old debt of £602,160, the bank owes £5,664,622.
Ut new debt there is thus about £8 3s. for every £1
or capital and reserves; and that suggests the wisdom
eitner of sitting 1 down hard on divs. and building up the
reserves rapidly or of calling in more capital. There
i A lO3 - ordi " ary shares, paid to £7 10s. ; another
£2 10s. is callable at the option of the directors,
and £l2 10s. is a reserve liability. The bank pro-
bably hesitates to make calls on shares on which it
is paying only 5 p.c. ; and, anyhow, the old deposits
are practically as good as capital until 1917. By
that time it doubtless hopes to have paid the prefs.
their five 7 p.c. divs., and then it may be in a posi-
tion to do something better for the ordinaries before
calling on them for more capital.
As things have improved and the old 4* p.c. debt
has been got rid of, the surplus available* for share-
holders has jumped ahead fast. On capital and re-
serves combined the return has moved like this;.—-

suggest that all the cake hasn t gone into that corner
—there hasbeen a crumb or two left for the virtuous
investor The co. started with a capital of £50,000,
of which £15,000 represented goodwill. As the re-
sult of three years operations the deficit, represented
by this paper item, has been wiped out, and a re-
serve of £10,647 established. In addition to the
dividends, averaging 15 p.c. p.a., the co. has in the
t c r 1 e o e Z,p ar l ma l e a proflt . of £ 13.147, and a further
£12,500 has been received as premiums on new
vsffonn Tb ® j a ? ital is now £100,000; the last
£50,000, issued in two lots, has gone to the original
shareholders at a premium of ss. per share. In order
to mop up last year’s profits it was necessary to pay
a bonus of 10 p.c. on top of the regular dividend of
10 p.c., making 20 p.c. for the year; and probably
because 20 p.c. divs. are liable to attract unfriendly
notice, shareholders are now bejng given the chance
to take another 25,000 shares at par. There cer-
tainly doesn’t appear to be any urgent demand for
t A < L^n? ey 7, because while the total liabilities are
£29,886, the cash in hand on March 31 was
£25,334, besides shares in other cos. at cost
( £5100) and £36,576 of book debts. To pile up
capital, even when you don’t want it in the business,
is of course a handy way to make the dividend look
respectably moderate in good times; but the excess
capital is liable to be a nasty drag in bad times.
So far as can be traced, the only investments are the
before-mentioned shares in other cos.; yet the return
on investments is given as £4856. Possibly a trifle
was got for money on deposit, though the whole lot
is said to be on current account; but in any case the
unspecified share investments appear to be amazingly
profitable—for the time being, anyway. Of the total
assets ( £155,533), £66,010 is represented by liquid
assets, investments (at cost), and book debts;
£73,409 is in stock, work in progress and plant;
and the small balance of £16,113 is in workshop
and other freehold and leasehold. The stock and
work in progress are said to be priced at or under
cost; and as the year started with £lOO,OOO of un-
finished work, there is room there to push a tidy
lump of profit into this current year’s accounts.
Just how long this kind of thing will last is another
matter. The drought has come; along with it has
come the income-tax assessments, which have made a
few people button up their pockets tighter; and the
fact that the Government can’t go on borrowing and
booming is pretty strongly hinted at by the two facts
that locally the Treasury is yelling for money and
offering 4 p.c. for it, while in London it has bor-
rowed a couple of millions on a 12 months’ bill,
much in the spirit of the desperate person who drops
in and asks you to swap cheques till to-morrow
morning.

Seven years ago, after the co.’s Sydney wharf pro-
perty had been resumed by the Government and paid
for, the co. had £43,000 in Treasury bills and de-
posits; and the capital was £58,096, in 16,599 shares
paid to £3 10s. The old co. was then wound up,
10s. per share was divided among shareholders and
£24,898, representing chiefly profit on the wharf
sale, was capitalised. The capital was thus brought
up to £74,695. Since then a few unallotted shares
have been issued, and the capital now stands at
£75,000, in 100,000 £1 shares paid to 15s. Since
March, 1905, when the new co. had taken the thing
over, the principal movements have been as follows:
_. ...... Mar.,’os. Sept.,’ll. Mar.,’l2.
Liabilities .. ..£1,165 £19,057 £21785
Ship property .. 40,393 84,708 75 376
Liquid assets .. .. 45,863 6,684 18’923
Other assets .. .. 2,667 5,522 5*738
The nature of the security represented by this co.’s
shares has thus changed very much during the
past seven years. In 1905 more than half the assets
were liquid ; now the co. has hardly any liquid assets
apart from an insurance claim. Meantime the per-
ishable ship property has been largely added to,
partly by using up the liquid assets, partly by going
into debt. Beyond showing this ehatlge in the nature
of the security, the accounts don’t throw much light
on the co.’s behavior. With a shipping concern
almost everything depends on whether enough of the
earnings is written off to counterbalance the wear
and tear of the vessels. A ship’s life is a compara-
tively brief thing; and, unless the owner is to be in
the soup presently, he must put aside enough out of
his earnings to replace the ark; and what he puts
aside, or writes off, isn’t profit, though he sometimes
thinks it is. This co. doesn’t mention the amount it
writes off; hence the profits may be understated or
overstated—it all depends on whether the provision
for renewals is too liberal or too mean. If the direc-
tors think they are doing just a fair thing, then it
is plain that, taking one year with another, the
co. isn’t quite earning the 7 p.c. div. which it pays.
Lately there have been some changes in the manage-
ment, on the Board and elsewhere; and probably
this may mean an improvement. The co. serves the
most dull and cow-like district in the State, and that
has been a handicap; but its own conduct hasn’t
been such as to make the average cow blush for her
lack of energy.
Adelaide’s counterpart of Sydney’s Greater
J. D. Williams Co. is the Greater Wondergraph Co.
There used to be a Wondergraph Co. that wasn't
Great, but it sold out to this concern for £3OOO in
shares. The new concern then bought a Hindley-
street ljlock for £22,500, and paid another £3805
to get rid of the old lessees; so it started with
£6805 of its capital represented by paper and hot
air, plus flotation exes., which ran to another £955.
The issued capital is only £30,000, of which £13,500
(10s. per share) was uncalled at the date of the last
balance; and the co. was humping a mortgage of
£15,000 on the land and a debt of £lOB3 on other
accounts before it put a brick on the new site. As
the new building won’t be available till Easter, 1913,
the co. is keeping its name in the public eye with
Town Hall shows in the winter and open-air shows
on North Terrace in the summer; and it is making
some sort of profit out of them. But the interest on
the £15,000 runs on, and that and a few other
trifles are not reckoned among the expenses, so there
will probably be a tidy deficiency to wipe out when
the new hall is opened. Meantime, shareholders are
officially assured that “the picture business is un-
doubtedly going ahead by leaps and bounds.” It is
going ahead; but it is one thing for a concern to
pay big divs. on a small capital, invested in films
and the like, and quite another thing for a concern
to pay big divs. on a big capital invested mainly in
freehold. The person who wants both the compara-
tive security of a freehold investment and the glitter-
ing return of a show speculation, is going to be dis-
appointed, unless a miracle happens. And miracles
don’t happen often —since the Labor party got into
power.

It isn’t much use digging far into the co.’s accounts
this half-year, because a strike shut up the mine
and works for the first two months, and it took a
long while after that to get things running again
in the old way. In the half-year ended March 31,
1911, the co. handled 183,335 tons of ore; in the
past half-year only 63,770 tons. Costs per ton of ore
run out this way: March, 1910, 16s. 4.61 d. ; March,
1911, 17s. 8.04 d. ; March, 1912, 275. 5.41 d. Apart from
the strike and its consequences the least satisfactory
feature disclosed is the further shrinkage in ore
values, especially at Mount Lyell. Here is a com-
parison :
Copper,p.c. Silver, oz. Gold, oz.
Average since ’O3 ..0.84 1.95 0.062
March, 1910 .. ..0.79 2.15 0.057
March, 1911 .. ..0.60 2.00 0.043
March, 1912 .. ..0.54 1.92 0.041
Luckily, the North Lyell at 1000 ft. and 1100 ft. “con-
tinues to open up in a most gratifying manner.”
The reserves are now estimated as follows:
Tons. Copper, p.c. Silver, oz. Gold, oz.
Lyell ..2,457,429 0.53 1.96 0.028
North .. 998,457 6.0 1.33 0.005
In the past half-year 39,583 tons came from Lyell
and 24,068 tons from the North.
The co., besides its copper business, runs super-
phosphate works at Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth;
but it effectively hides its profits from this source.
Its works at these places are valued at £182,535.
If it made out of the chemical-manure business any-
thing like the profit it is credited with, the net profit
from the mining business last half-year must have
been nil or thereabouts. Last half-year wasn’t nor-
mal, certainly; but in view of the rising costs and
the shrinking values, the management evidently sees
the need for hunting up economies from somewhere.
The big scheme at present in hand is to harness the
water power at Lake Margaret, seven miles from the
reduction works, and use electric- instead of steam-
power for all mine and works’ operations. The money
for this big job is to come from an issue of 100,000
£1 shares at a 6s. premium: this will bring the
share capital up to £1,300,000. With a liquid sur-
plus of £420,581 the co. could have financed the
new works easily enough; and there was certainly
better justification for issuing new capital to provide
the superphosphate works than there is to thus
supply a plant to do the work that an existing nlant
is doing.
British Broken Hill accounts to De-
cember 31 arrived from London by this week’s mail.
The six months’ profit was £68,392, of which £3060
was written off for debenture redemption (there
are £30,000 6 p.c. debentures to wrestle with) and
£3422 for depreciation; balance, £61,910. One
2s. div. ( £30,000) was paid during the half-year,
and a 3 s. followed it. The position on December 31
was: Liquid assets, £76,189 (this is exclusive of
stores, £16,124) ; liabilities (including debentures)
£45,932 ; surplus, £30,257. Of the half-vear’s re-
venue, £15,172 is credited to slimes (sold to the
Junction North) and £13,333 is on tailings account-
the latter is independent of the £29,839 derived
from the sale of zinc concentrates produced on the
premises. The profit is thus not wholly derived
from the half-year’s actual operations. The ore out-
put was 81,076 tons sulphides and 701 tons carbon-
ates (the latter sold crude) ; and the ore reserves
are estimated at a certain 1,000,000 tons and a pro-
bable extra 1,000,000 tons above the bottom level.
General manager Woodhead, who wrote his report in
London, is “confident that the tonnage mentioned
above will be exceeded.” Tonnage, however, is not
everything. What about grade? On this point the
report is beautifully vague. For instance: “No. 136
diamond drill, No. 9 level: 0 to 4ft., good ore; 4
to 26ft., low-grade ore; 26 to 43ft., schist, with
specks of sulphides; 43 to 73ft., average to low-

grade ore; 73 to 85ft., schist.” The ore bodies are
irregular, and they are broken into by intrusions of
garnet sandstone and rhodonite which to the mill-
man are the devil. It is a wise manager who refuses
to give an estimate of the quantity of reserves in a
mine like this, and it is a still wiser one that keeps
dead silence about values. Which means that, of
all the bigger mines at Broken Hill, the British is
about the most speculative. In good times hitherto
it has been able to flash out big profits and con-
siderable dividends; in bad times it has mostly shut
up. The future will probably be much like the past.
Broken Hill Junction North, which for
years past has made a hobby of miscalculating things,
is up against the problem of raising the wind.
When the co. decided to go in for treating slimes
purchased from other mines, which did-n t want to
have the offensive stuff on their consciences, it
thought it could get the money “partly by a tem-
porary bank overdraft, and parjy out of the profit
of the mine.” Then everything began to go the
other way, as usual. The expected money hasn t
been earned from the mine; and the plant has been
delayed, wherefore that hasn’t been able to earn
anything either; and instalments on the purchased
stuff have had to be paid; and, altogether, the co.
is “up against it.” So the Board proposes to offer
shareholders 3600 bonds of £25 each for £l5
apiece, redeemable in 20 quarterly instalments of
255. each, the first to be paid in October next, in
other words, the co. proposes to pay *1“ for the
use of a sum diminishing from £l5 to £1 ss. tor
three years. If the co. didn’t pay a cent of the
£l5 back for three years, the interest would be at
the rate of 22 p.c.; taking the repayments into ac-
count the rate runs up to about 45 p.c. Ihe direc-
tors probably know best what the co.’s credit is like,
but if this is the best it can do, the worst must be
pretty dreadful.
The Block 14 offspring at Torrington
(N.S.W.) has not turned out equal to representa-
tions. According to the first report of the co., the
quantity of ore available at Fielder’s Hill is 72,000
tons, which is considerably less than was originally
estimated. However, prospects are judged good
enough to erect a mill on. This plant is to have a
capacity of 800 tons a week. The deeper workings
show the ore to be refractory, as it contains wolfram,
bismuth and cobalt. Wolfram is more valuable with-
out the bismuth, and the elimination of the cobalt is
likely to give trouble. From 1170 tons of ore. about
11 tons of concentrates were obtained, bringing in
£1022, at a cost of £1067, which doesn’t include
renewals and administration, £1232.
* * * *
A few of the mines at Hillgrove (N.S.W.)
that haven’t been able to scratch along in their in-
dividual capacity are to be incorporated as the
Eleanora Mines, Ltd. The capital (£60,000, in
shares of £1 each) is divided up into 25,000 con-
tributing, 10,000 reserve shares and 25,000 fully
paid-up vendors’ shares. The Styx River power
rights and some plant are to be thrown in with the
bargain. The Eleanora south shaft is to be deepened,
and future prospecting work conducted from the one
starting point. Development has been going on foi
over a year, and results are considered to warrant
the splashing of some cash above ground. lhe pre-
sent milling capacity is to be increased from 800
tons to 5000 tons a month, and the cyamding plant
is to be enlarged accordingly. The mines concerned
are the Eleanora, Garibaldi, Hillgrove and Golden
Gate. There may be irregular dividends in the
bundle, but there is also a heap of worry for cer-
tain. *
No work has been done on Mount Drys-
dale (N.S.W.) for some time, and a scheme has been
afoot for an amalgamation with its neighbor, New
Eldorado. It was reported lately that this amalga-
mation had been agreed to, but no details have been
given as to relative holdings of shares, etc. lhe pro-
spects of the amalgamated show are not brilliant.
The balance-sheet of Mount Drysdale last December
showed liabilities £5343, against sundry debtors
£953 and outstanding calls £421. lhe Eldorado
liabilities totalled £1628, against outstanding
calls of £l6B. Other assets, such as stores,
etc., may be disregarded. The position seems
to be that Mount Drysdale hasn t got any
ore in sight worth mentioning, and if the Eldorado
has any it would need a new shaft and new plant
without the amalgamation. Suspension of labor con-
ditions for both cos. expires this month.

were paid in the West during

Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) treated the
record quantity of 243,109 tons in 1911 for a return
of £307 275. The net profit was £48,459, and this,
with the balance brought forward from the Previous
vear minus a small amount for depreciation in in-
vestments, provided £67,052 for jrotmatwn but
nrpcip'nt there is no dividend, ine maeoteu
ness to the co’s bankers (£48,289) has been liqui-
dated and the broken-ore reserve increased. The
Board explains that the unexpected falling off in the
value of the ore treated during the past few months
delays the payment of a dividend, but one is pro-
mised as soon as possible. Working costs have been
reduced to a shade over 18s. Id. per ton, which
figure is said to be the lowest on the Kalgoorlie field.
In the general manager’s report the reserves are esti-
mated at 514,684 “actual” tons of 255. 3d. ore, and
292,980 “probable” tons of 21s. Bd. ore, making alto-
gether 807,664 tons, of an average value of 235.
lid. Developments on the Lake View lode in the
bottom of the mine have, it is admitted, failed to
expose payable ore; but bearing in mind what hap-
pened in some of the higher levels, hopes are enter-
tained of good values being eventually met with in
this part.
* * * *
Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) is erecting
the first unit of a new type of ore-roasting plant to
deal with 30 tons a day. The funds in hand are be-
lieved to be sufficient to give this process a fair trial,
and if it succeeds where others failed, shareholders
are to be asked to subscribe towards the installation
of a bigger plant.
# * * *
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) held its annual
meeting in London on April 16, when the chairman
announced that apart from the £78,000 in hand, the
co. had a profit in sight underground of £390,000,
making £468,000 in all. This, coupled with the be-
lief that the directors had clean hands and clean
consciences, was, he contended, inherent proof of
soundness. Inevitable causes and adverse circum-
stances were respectively blamed for costs going up
and outputs coming down; but while it was pre-
dicted that the expense of production would never
again be as low as it formerly was, a little improve-
ment on last year’s average was looked for in the cur-
rent year. Recent developments were vaguely de-
scribed as being good enough to satisfy the most ex-
acting, but a definite statement as to how the pro-
perty was shaping in the bottom level, and what
the actual underground prospects for the ensuing 12
months were, was not given. The forgetfulness of
the chairman in this respect is unfortunate, par-
ticularly as a deeply-rooted feeling prevails in some
wide-awake quarters that the mine is seriously ail-
ing at depth. #
Golden Ridge (W.A.) recovered £32,240
during the half-year ended March, and after docking
working expenditure and setting aside £5247 for de-
velopment and depreciation, it had £8722 left.
Out of this and the unappropriated balance from the
previous year, two Is. 6d. dividends were paid, leav-
ing £2296 to be carried forward. Cash assets are
estimated at £11,962, and there are also 7600 tons
of assorted mill residues on hand of a supposed value
of £4885. The manager sorrowfully reports that
the past six months’ developments have been disap-
pointing, and refuses on account of the “impracti-
cability of measuring the ore and the erratic distri-
bution of values,” to give any estimate of reserves.
Apparently the beginning of the end.
* * * *
North Kalgurli (W.A.) is still content to
subsist on royalties. The total value of the gold
won by tributors since 1907 is about £120,000,
of which the co. has received over £lB,OOO. Ihe
present monthly output averages about £2OOO.

John Morgan has completed his examina-
tion of Chaffers (W.A.), and cabled the result of his
sampling to London. He estimates the reserves at
74,682 short tons of 30s. 6d. ore, and recommends
sinking and development in the bottom workings in
preference to the manager’s proposal to spend money
on additions to the mill. Morgan’s estimate is ex-
clusive of some 30,000 tons of partially-developed ore
at the Nos. 15 and 16 levels, the value of which is
computed at 28s. 2d. per ton.
8., M. and Co. are about to lose a good
man in J. A. Agnew. Agnew took control of the
firm’s business in the West when Loring left, and
has since proved himself one of the ablest mining
engineers and mineowners’ representatives ever asso-
ciated with the industry in Australia.
“Main Shaft”: Have just had a look at
Mount Oxide (Q,). The ore occurrence is in a
crushed zone of altered slates, with quartzite flank-
ing the footwall country and specular iron on the
hanging-wall. The ore channel, judging by a cross-
cut at 200 ft., is of great width —probably over
500 ft., if the quartzite bar showing on surface is to
be taken as footwall country. Ore has been found
for a distance of 1500 ft. along the outcrop, which
rises 300 ft. to 400 ft. above the level country, and
about 100 ft. north of the north prospecting shaft
the lode butts into a mountain of hematite, where
a big body of lower-grade stuff may be found.
Northerly, beyond these few million tons of iron,
the copper shows again as veins in a silicious iron,
30ft. of it bulking 4 p.c. Henry’s developments
were begun on an outcrop of very rich ore 10ft. wide
and 60ft. long, and all this outcrop has been shipped.
This shoot lengthens rapidly and northerly ; at sur-
face it was 60ft., at 200 ft. it was 200 ft. long, and
the best ore struck in the level is in the face at
165 ft., 6ft. of it bulking 39 p.c. At surface costeens
have been entered every 140 ft., and the No. 2 tunnel,
which is 68ft. in ore, struck a rich make of ore at
60ft. in, and they are now winzmg on it. these
surface workings show 5 p.c. ore over great widths,
and the existence of rich shoots in a channel of such
width and length is fairly certain. The two richest
points of the mine are the bottom of the winze,
273 ft. below the collar of the mam shaft, and the
face of the north drive 170 ft. froin the adit cross-
cut At surface this shoot was about 60ft. long,
worth 30 p.c. ; at the 200 ft. level the shoot is nearly
200 ft loner, never under sft. wide, as shown by the
drive, and in places 20 ft. wide. Although the mine
has been opened up for ore exports and not for the
development of tonnage for smelting, it is surprising
how little rabbit-warren work there is about it.
Winning mainly from development, up to the present
Henry has exported nearly 2000 tons of ore, bulking
35 p.c.; and the last few weeks’ work in the winze
and the north drive has won 460 tons of 43 p.c.
The one trouble is transport, and that will be largely
removed by the use of road trains. To take away
that 460 tons would call for 920 horses, and the
horses once gone from the mine are lost for two
months. Transport to the Gulf is now £8 per ton
of ore; it is estimated that road trains would do
it for £3 a ton, bringing back loading of coke
against the starting of a smelting campaign.

The half-yearly meeting of the Hampden-
Gloncurry (Q.) added a few further details to the
recently-published report. The Scalper lease, which
is the latest purchase, was acquired because it pre-
sented promising surface indications of basic ore,
the needful and valuable (because scarce) flux for
the more common silicious ores. The rails to the
Duchess mine have been laid to the 25 mile
while the earthworks have been completed to the 32
mile peg, leaving only four miles to go. lhis
time the line is expected to be finished in June; but
expectations don’t count for much when past records
are taken as a guide. Time was when the co. ex-
pected to start smelting at the end of last year.
The total cost of copper production, including reali-
sation, is estimated not to exceed £35 per ton.
The financial position is weak, for the co. has a
“deposit at call” amounting to nearly £40,000;
but the exercise of the Baillieu option over the
50,000 shares at £1 is darkly hinted at as a means
of relieving the stringency.

With a long purse and a keen eye for a
bargain, Mount Elliott has bought the Trafalgar
mine, which contains a sft. vein of good grade. The
Limestone has been re-named the Selwyn, and is
being vigorously opened up to get out some high-
grade ore, while the price of copper is high. Work
is also being pushed on at Hampden South Consols,
and ore from the dump (6 p.c. to 10 p.e.) is being
railed to Mount Elliott. At the Elliott itself latest
developments at the bottom (500 ft.) are such as to
make general manager Corbould feel very comfort-
able.
* * * *
“Rangan”: Mount Chalmers (Rockhamp-
ton), for so many months idle, has started again.
The old company has been wound up, and the
Great Fitzroy Mines, Limited, registered with
a capital of £225,000, in 900,000 ss. shares.
The unfortunate shareholders in the old com-
pany get an equivalent of 2s. a share, being
entitled to one share in the new company paid
up to 25., for every old share held. The ore is plenti-
ful, but scattered, and requires economical working,
neglect of which brought about the downfall of the
old Fitzroy co. The reserves are estimated at 60,000
tons, averaging 3 p.c. of copper and 2.sldwt. of gold
to the ton.
Now that the Great Fitzroy (Q.) is in
swing again, Glassford Creek is to get another
show. Ores will be carted to Many Peaks, and
trained to the Fitzroy, which will make an exhaus-
tive test of the stuff as a flux.
* * * *
Ravenswood (Q.) keeps in a good mood;
4145 tons were treated in April for £11,930. The
Sunset, owned by the New Ravenswood Co., was
responsible for just on half —2728 tons for £4469.
The London North, with 515 tons for £893, con-
tinues to justify its purchase. The New Ravens-
wood Co. took it over about 12 months ago on
terms—74 p.c. of the gross yield of gold, with
the right to buy for £7OO within a year. The
option was exercised in five months, and the mine
paid the bill in next to no time.
* * * *
Bluff Colliery (Q.) had a sixpenny divi-
dend (6000 shares) the other day—the first since
May, 1908. Present total Is. 3d. Shareholders
needed some balm to heal the wound made by the
report of the Admiralty test of the Mammoth coal,
the Mammoth being an offspring of the Bluff.
* * * *
No. 3 Columbia North, Gympie (Q.), had
a crushing of 254 tons the other day for 4090 z. On
the strength of the luck it shouted itself a three-
penny dividend. Its score to date is 2s. 4d. on
80,000 shares, paid to 3s. But the co. has
had to dig deep to catch its sprats; the present
hopeful looking workings are at and below 1656 ft.,
where the streak is from Bin. to 18in. wide.*
Natty John Brandon has donned a new
pair of gloves to face the Collins-street winter, for
he and partner Rollason have got the legal manage-
ment of Mount Jasper. It isn’t disclosed why this
shift has been made out of the office where little
Langford sported his oak for so long. Perhaps the
flogging of shares from £l7 to £5 in about 48
hours may have ended in a dust-up inside. Brandon
and Rollason seem to want a first-class expert to
overhaul the claim, and the market is just in the
mood to back up any such request. There has been
a bit of a preliminary press scrap over the non-
publication of the assays got at the Mount Stewart,
due, so the winds whisper, to some “made in Ger-
many” agreement. But why howl about such a
trifle when the man-in-charge reports having cut a
eosteen 50ft. long on the new find, adds that some-
thing not altogether specified is “still going on and
is strong,” and mentions that the lode carries rich
chalcopyrite for the 500 ft., and that it is a monte
it will junction with the Jasper lode! It may be
comforting to have such a neighbor; but still that
doesn’t do away with the need to call in an expert
to put the tape over the Jasper.

The Mineral Separation and De Bavay
Process 00. is to have its head office in Melbourne.
Various Broken Hill cos. will pay royalty to this
central concern, which will also collect revenue from
the Wallaroo and Moonta. (S.A.), and the Great Fitz-
roy and Einasleigh (Q.). The capital is nominally
£300,000 in £1 shares, with some in reserve.
The Mineral Separation Co. takes a 55 p.c. interest
and the Amalgamated Zinc 45 p.c. The Zinc Cor-
poration and the Elmore people stand out.

Some funny stuff got into Melbourne
print over the North Nuggetty slump. Ihus the
Argus let E. L. Vince proclaim on May 20 that
manager Gullock had reported to the Board that
there had been no unfavorable change at the mine
until this last fortnight, when the quality of the
stone had decidedly fallen off.” Perhaps; but the
market had shot a javelin long before. Then the
local correspondent thumped out that the clean-up
“may be regarded as satisfactory, in that nearly an
ounce to the ton was secured.” Seeing that the re-
turn was for six weeks, and that the previous
month’s crushing of 940 tons gave 14680*, this
complacency hit folk on the raw, especially when the
news got out that instead of a 3s. dividend no pro-
fits were to be cut up. The job now talked of is to
shift the office and stir things up lustily. If so,
what a chance for a commission to make up a search-
ing inquiry, even to the extent of overhauling the
man who iit out first when shares flopped from 88s.
A lot of the small fry at Bendigo are
having a flutter because the return to the upper
saddle and spur formations has ended m some
blocks of stone being picked up. United Hustlers
and Redan were tipped to go'to 15s -°f u g^ e in feef°is
bevond the break north at 365 ft. Still tne reel is
a 'small thing, and the knowing ones preferred the
good old Bendigo practice of making their profits
out of the market. Golden too have got on
the move on the strength of their 447-632 ft. develop
merits. Old diners are very dainty, though, over
Bendigo fare. It can’t be impressed too hard that
these old-new shallow makes don t carry the tonnage
to 6 provide a long succession of .dividends; and a
tricky market shadows most Bendigo “investments.
* * * *
Mount Lyell has, it is said, made a deal
with the Lyell Comstock to take over that co. s
delectable show. It lieth against the Peaks and the
Blocks and has served to fee directors and e mpl°y
mining engineers sinee the Crotty days of the field.
Bio- talk was once heard of what concentration was
to °do for several thousand tons of the Comstock
schisty rock; but Robert Sticht always smiled at
the idea, and doubtless knew that the big co. would
get the whole outfit for its smelters by waiting long
enough. Not that the' Comstock was, or is ever
likely to be, worth much unless kind Providence
has heaved the North Lyell shoot o ore into b
depths. It certainly is credited with possessing
450 000 tons of ore, ranging froin 24 to it P-c.
copper; but this is mostly poor stuff, and thewhole
bin of treasure is to pass over to Sticht s hands tor
£20,000 —so it is rumored. * *
An old ghost with a history woke up the
other day. Away back in ’Bl and ’B2,theGalawa,
near Rockhampton (Q.), was o ™ d h - v o " e . t
Morgan. Sandy Gordon worked for him, and it was
from there that the pair and Morgan s brother set out
on the journey which ended m the P ar &, tr *? p i h f
over Mount Morgan. There is nothing left of the
Galawa ghost now but tailings, and the other day
36 tons were put through for £37. Having yielded
up that handful, the ghost went to sleep again.
* * * *
The once-dazzling Croydon (Q.) mine, the
G.G. 3 and 4 South, turned over to its last page the
other day when the machinery was offered for sale.
The first crushing was taken out in ’97, when 56
tons gave 89oz. After that the mine produced
88,5460 z. for its original proprietors, and 33710 z.
for tributors —in all 91,9170 z. from 31,960 tons.
Though worked only to a depth of 260 ft. the ground
is now abandoned, and there isn t anything in the
bottom to make an unprejudiced party want to tackle
it again. * #
For the half-year closing March 31, Tong-
kah Harbor (Siam) produced 794 tons 13ewt. of tin
oxide, which, after paying royalty, returned £84,779,
or an average of £lO6 12s. per ton. This average
price compares poorly with the price obtained for
tin oxide in Australia, and suggests that the tin
concentrates contain less than 70 p.c. metallic tin,
which at 365. per unit, is at present worth £126 per
ton in Sydney. For March —the last month of the
half-year—Tongkah Harbor scored a revenue of
£14,480 from 133 tons 6cwt. of oxide, which pans
out an average of £lOB 17s. sd. per ton. During
the half-year, 1,647,634 cubic yards of washdirt were
dredged and treated, so the return of £84,779
amounts to a fraction over Is. per yard. Costs, so
far as can be made out from the last annual report,
are below 4d. per yard, so the gross profit is, roughly,
two-thirds of the value of the tin oxide produced.
“Will the undertaking pav?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleichert
and Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeways work-
ii g in Australia, or in course of erection, and will
soon have at work, near Sydney, one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants in existence. Special
electric and other cranes and mono-rail conveyors
can be procured from the same firm.*

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for
steam-pipes and boilers has been exemplified by a re-
cent scientific treatise of the principles of steam
conveyance. Tests made have established the fact
that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this
material, at a pressure of 2001 b. per square inch, and
coal at 16s, per ton, will save £7 per year, ana
prevent loss of pressure equal to 13.84 B. Th. U. per

ducting Composition, supplied in cwt. bags, or

After considerable discussion on the advantages and
disadvantages of the mechanical stonebreaking as
against the handbreaking, the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council (Vic.) decided in favor of the mechanical
method, and, on comparing the various makes of
machine, decided that the one most suited to their
needs was the Bigelow Patent Stone Crusher. They
purchased a 16in. x 9in. portable machine, and from
their engineer’s various reports on the matter they
are more than satisfied with it.
From June to September the Council crushed and
spread 3000 cub. yards of road metal at an average
cost of 2/6 per cub. yard; and the cost of spalls per
cub. yard averaged 2/4, making a total cost of 4/10
per cub. yard broken and spread. Their last con-
tract under the hand-breaking system amounted to
6/3 per cub. yard, stacked on the roadside, and
spreading 1/-; total 7/3, as against the 4/10 of the
mechanical system. Saving, 2/5 per cub. yard. These
figures speak for themselves to those interested m
the matter. , .
The Bigelow breakers, which are also largely used
by the mining companies of Australia, are manu-
factured by the Austral Otis Engineering Company,
South Melbourne, who will be glad to answer en-
quiries.* L 3

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 27, 1912.
My Deae Akini, —
When the mortal remains of that kindly
old Bohemian, Emily Soldene, were con-
signed to Mother Earth, a parson named
Mould was “amongst those present.” Emily
would have jibbed in her life at the idea of
anything so close in nomenclature to the
final sod, sniffing the funeral baked meats
at the last appearance of a friend of her
own. But the ghostly curtain rings down
with a bump, and the chief performer has
no time to choose his (or her) chorus in
the pick-and-shovel act.
A correspondent drops in from Jerusalem
to say that Miss Florence Menk-Meyer, ac-
campanied by her eldest sister and her oug
dog Xenophon, is (or was) in the Holy
Land. If Xenophon, by ill-chance, should
meet the hoof of an enraged Syrian camel
in some crowded alley, would he howl in the
Greek language, I wonder, or merely lick
the part in Sanscrit?
The youthful singer, Leah Myers, got
away with £SS as the profits of a recent
complimentary sing-song. Mrs. Francis
Cohen gave the girl the cheque the other
day, and Mrs. Trefle (another committee
woman who scratched the four corners of
this city to sell concert tickets) took charge
of the thanksgiving service.
The Eva Mylott reception committee is
reported to be reduced to 19in. round the
waist. This is the result of hunger. As a
matter of fact, the bony visage of starvation
stares the committee in the face, because the
feverish rush of arrangements to receive
Eva makes it difficult to spare time for even
a mid-day snack. The event is to be a great
one. All sorts and conditions of ferry-boat
will be snatched from their accustomed
wharf, and sent outside the Heads to blow
the horn of plenty and wave the banner and
hanky of welcome as the lady ap-
proaches, and she is to be received with
000 cheers or more. Saturday, July 6, is
the date of the expedition. Sunday will be
devoted to contemplating the solidity of dry
land. Monday, noon (July S), has been
seized by Mayor Clarke as a convenient mo-
ment to Town Hall the wanderer. The com-
mittee will then give Eva five minutes to say
her prayers, and whisk her off to a tea party
at the Australia. July 9 will be set apart
as a day of suspended animation. The lady-
mittens will then let down their back hair,
roll all over the privacy of their bedroom
floors, practise deep breathing, skip two
dozen times before stopping to see what
they’ve smashed, and perform all the other
hard-labor antics which Beauty specialists
call ‘rest-cure.” This done, they will bound
into the byways to sell Eva Mylott concert
tickets.
Journalist Florence Baverstock, who lost
her sister, Miss Emily Blair, last week, has
had some hard knocks of late, from that
mmx, Blind Chance. Ink ran in the Blair
family in a steady flow, inherited from their
father, the late David Blair. But only Florence
shouldered the pen as a regular tool of trade,
bhe was a worthy successor of the lamented
Sappho Smith” (.Miss Ina Wildman) on
this page, but left it on her marriage, being
called upon by that brute Circumstance to
settle in Melbourne. Later, she returned to
Sydney, and her informative nib lifted the
lelegkaph’s women’s columns for a time
out of the deadly, dreary ruck of long dress
reports and the lists of those who “also ran”
at miscellaneous functions. But the ruck
resumed business, as presumably better suited
to the genteel lady reader, who eagerly
chases the tales of interminable tea-fights at
the breakfast table, and reads with starting
eyes that “Miss Jones looked pretty as
usual, and that Miss Robinson wore a gar-
niture of brown bombazine trimmed with
pale black, and was so tightly laced that she
could only breathe by deputy. Now, after
some minor _ misfortunes in the House of
Baverstock, it has lost the clever, humorous
Emily, a female Mark Tapley with the
brains that over-rated optimist mislaid in his
first youth.
The Misses Fowlds, daughters of the ex-
Mimster for Education in the ex-Ward
Cabinet, passed through this town-
ship, for Melbourne, by Sunday’s express.
Speaker Arthur Guinness, of Maoriland,
will (possibly) onen his lips and break his
Jong silence in Sydney in a day or two.
He s going to hurry back to his horsehair
fixmars after an agreeable jaunt through
N.S.W. and Victoria. Wife and daughter
have shared the Great Australian Silence of
non-Speaker Guinness.
Government Astronomer Adams (M.L.)
and his lady are expected to strike the
pavements hereabouts in a few days.
Mrs. Walter Hall first hit the public
imagination in a vulnerable place, by her
munificence to her late husband’s relations.
She added, if I remember aright, various
substantial sums to the modest legacies left
by the Money-spinner to his own people.
These amounts she considered more in pro-
portion to the towering character of his
accumulated hoard. The woman who sets
?■. kyjhcr financial value on her husband’s
kinsfolk than he does himself is not only
above rubies in price, but as rare as a Cui-
linan diamond. The million which Mrs
Hall hands over to charity doesn’t dazzle
her own sex in comparison with the gener-
ous gifts she showered on those whom the
Affluent usually consider as good an invest-
ment as the bottomless pit; i.e., poor or
moderately poor relations.
Mr. Stuart, the smart young manager of
the Dutch packet line, is a Dutchman with
Scottish forebears. He speaks English with
a Dutch accent, but there’s a “canny” ex-
pression about his silence in the middle of a
conversation that is a whole Highland
gathering of discretion.
The Medical School of Sydney Uni. lost
an ornament last week when typhoid killed
Dr. Ethel Talbot. She was one of the tribe
of graceful daughters that came out of the
Randwick Scotchbyterian manse, and, after
getting her license to kill or cure, the shy
girl surprised her chums by deciding to
specialise in mental diseases. She put in
some time at Callan Park, then left it, but
presently got back to her absorbing study.
It didn’t last long, for the light went out at
Empire Day shed its wet bunting under
weeping skies. At the Royal Exchange,
where the city merchant cracks corn and
other fodder, a mixed service took place in
the morning. St. Andrew’s Cathedral con-
tributed a small slice of its tuneful boy choir
to cheer Britannia on her weary tramp in
search of bread for her submerged tenth. The
choir hustled into its place on a deal plat-
form, wiping the rain out of its ears and
slapping itself dry about its chest, before
the Elect trailed into their selection on the
dais. Joseph Massey conducted the boys'
sweet treble chirp through a programme
studded with the atmosphere of flag-flapping
and cock-a-doodle-doodle-doodle-do. The best
item, “An Empire Call,” was written long
ago by the meek negative person who signs
himself “Anon.” He is one of a family of
three, the other two being “A Voice,” so
well known in the political world, and Sun-
dries, the eminent cricketer. The work of
“Anon” was set to charming music by
Henry Bishop. Kipling’s jingo ode, “Lest
We horget,” which followed the peaceful lilt
of dead and gone “Anon,” sounded very thin
swashbuckle by comparison.
At last year’s Exchange bunting rally,
the Admirable King-Hall astonished the Em-
pire native by manfully expressing his be-
lief —guarded by technical preservatives—
in an Australian navy. He was then prac-
tically the first big naval gun—certainly
the first who has heaved officially on
the surface of these waters —who hadn’t
exploded with laughter at the thought of a
Commonwealth section of the Fleet. I re-
member the sniffy and expressive glances
that passed between various buttresses of
the Empire, the Royal Exchange on May 24
being the last terminus on earth where any
good thing would be expected to come out of
Australia. Many things have happened in
a year.. “I am more convinced than ever,”
said King-Hall, R.N., this year, speaking of
an Australian-owned and Australian-manned
and Australian-managed fleet, “that no other
policy is possible.” Baronet Joseph Ward’s
more circuitous speech on the advantages of
trusting wholly to Britain lost its punch by
reason of the Ancient Mariner who com-
mands 11.M.5. Drake and other British sea-
fowl in this port, getting on his legs again
with a back answer. “I cordially agree
with part of So-and-So’s remarks,” etc. A
veteran or backstay of the Exchange handed
Mrs. Joseph a plump cushion covered with
the Union John Bull bunting. Secretary
_B. Millin looked after the damp proceed-
the Police Band played “God
Save” on the wet steps with raindrop varia-
tions.
I hope the Empire will remember Thomas-
street (Newtown) when it’s giving away
nice new suburban villas or other handy
presents, for Thomas-street remembered the
Hemp-ire with much bunting and several
Boy-Shouts the other afternoon. One of
these .warriors who put his muscle into the
flag display at the Free Kindergarten School
in the narrow by-way of Tom-street, ad-
mitted, under severe cross-examination, that
he d been one of the Baden-Powell guard of
honor. Then he said nothing more that
could be used against him.
Students who are passing through the
Kindergarten College (Roslyn Gardens),
where the brisk Miss Dumolo presides over
the ethics of Froebel, and smart young
teachers from the various Free Kindergarten
Academies in this, city, gave the Thomas-
street show to Britannia. In the morning
infants ranging from about three to six
years had expressed their firm conviction in
every child garden, that Britain ruled the
seas. They had retired on bribes of cake
and heavy slabs of bread and jam—the day
being full of mud and water —when a hand-
some Britannia (Miss Gardiner, a daughter
of the late. Scotchbyterian shepherd of
Manly) got into action. She was defended
by two youngsters in spangles, etc., and
paced the Thomas-street school floor be-
hind a large brass shield. English roses
(white muslin and floral display), Scottish
thistles, armed with tartans, golf sticks and
other useful gifts, and Irish colleens dumped
down all the things (such as Irish crochet
etc ) that our aged North Sea parent is
likely to want when she clears her decks for
action.
.As a display of attractive tableaux the
Kindergarten damsels did all and more than
Britannia expected of them. Curator
Maiden s pretty daughter was one of the
fern-draped Maorilanders. A Hottentot and
Indian squaw (two tall Brown sisters), Miss
Laing (leading the Irish crochet contin-
gent), Miss Nicholson (beating the air with
a flag), and Mrs. Dane as the Southern
Cross, were really clever counterfeits. Aus-
tralia did some hurried shearing with a pair
of garden clippers on a toy lamb, and
handed t-he proceeds to Mrs. Britain, who
can stop her ears with the wool when the
cry of her hungry children gets on her
nerves. . Committee ladies, Mrs. Charles
MacLaurin, Mrs. Ross, and that surprising
youngster, Mrs. Curnow (aged 83), turned
out in the wet to explore the inner recesses
of the Thomas-street bunting. Gen. Sec.
Ellen Desailly, Miss Louisa Atkinson and
other lovers of small fry watched the adult
competition for the Empire Stakes.
“Winchie,” writing from North Queens-
land, enclosed a contribution to be for-
warded to the brave little girl of 14 who
mothered an orphaned brood of brothers
and sisters at Green Ponds, Tasmania. De-
tails of the mothering, while the wolf
yapped on the doorstep, strayed into page
16 of The Bulletin of May 2. The Little
Mother has, by this time, assimilated the
unknown friend’s postal note. “If you can’t
make out what ‘Winchie’ means,” says he,
“ask a wharf-lumper.”
The ice-season for skates was broken open
by the first falls or preliminary slither of
winter at the Glaciarium last week. The
gathering was by invitation only. That
lure dragged the Very Best Feet off the
tender rail, and a huge gathering of the Ex-
pensively Shod splashed through mud and
rain to be present. The falls were chiefly
amongst the regular brigade, for beginners
were warned off the ice-pack.
An exuberant style of male dresser always
breaks out in mustard-colored gloves at any
social clatter of more noise than usual.
Elderly young men and frivolous youths in
the sere and faded circumstance of 70 or so
invariably paw the Glaciarium atmosphere
with hands like mustard plasters. They
were all present the other day.
The tall Anderson girls in black wore
twin hats that shook rival plumes like long
bottle brush flowers —one red, the other pale
mouse —and mostly skimmed the ice together
in the vicinity of the vice-freezall enclosure.
This was inhabited by the G.-G., heavily dis-
guised in the snug Silver King type of over-
coat in which Julius Knight always returned
amid a stage thunderstorm, shedding tears
of. joy on the astrakhan rovers. But he
toilet of his. Ex. was extinguished by Her
appearance in a black gown that swept the
earth, under a coat of ermine which is
alleged to be without a mate in this State.
It’s the new ermine, with no black tails on
its short milk-white fur. Perhaps this high-
class pelt is descended from some family of
Ermine that quartered a Manx cat on its
crest, or its bust, or whatever you would na-
turally quarter a cat on. Only mayors and
kings and other unfashionable persons, I’m
told, can now be seen abroad in ermine with
tails all over its face. A black hat with the
chief ostrich feather of the last S’African
plucking floating over its roof, completed
this sartorial splendor.
A.D.C. Nutting seemed to be moulting at
the Glaciarium revel, and only grew a small
red and white tip in the middle of his cocked
hat. He swallowed his tea on the uneasy
edge of his State chair, and looked as com-
fortable as circumstances permitted, under
the combined glare of about 500 female eyes.
Chamberlain Nevill hovered on the official
edge of the Silver King coat. Mr. Tom
Hughes buckled on his skates late in the
afternoon. Miss Hypatia Monk slid across
the freeze with brisk attention to business.
Nellie Stewart looked on in black velvet,
under the rim of a great raven hat of Sweet
Nell dimensions. And Society tackled the
ice with an inch or two more in its skirt
measurement than it permitted its lean
calves last winter.
As the State Government is at present
biting its nails in perplexity as to the ulti-
mate end of Government House (Mac-
quarie-street), and as no one seems to want
it acutely except the Governor-General,
may I offer another suggestion. Why not
turn it into a hay and chaff conservatorium
for the. aged ’bus horse? This long-suffering
beast is in need of an old-age pension.
Where could he chew the evening of his life
in greater comfort than in the grey old pile
that faces the rising sun? The ball-room
would accommodate many down-at-fetlock
gentry, and cosy winter quarters could be
fixed up in the main hall at small cost. Mr.
Montagu Rothery ought to lead a forlorn
hope in this matter, and attack each Minis-
ter separately. Mr. Carmichael is always
open to new ideas—why not try him with a
Chaff Conservatorium?
Re the Admirable King-Hall (who now
leaves the “Vice” off the official handle to
his deep-water frontage), a friend who
knew them slightly in the old days at Malta,
says: “In those happy times when I was
young and full of the joy of life, the King-
Halls were on the Mediterranean station.
The then Mrs. K.-H. was full of good
works and missionary zeal, having caught
religious fervor and prayer-meetings from
her husband. When other officers’ wives at
Malta were capering round at dances, etc.,
we used to see the fragile Mrs. K.-H. drag-
ging herself wearily home from the slums
where she had been struggling to improve
the minds of the poor. She had a pretty,
graceful head, and her only vanity was nice
millinery.” Even saints may be fidgetty
about the hang of their imperishable white
robes, and Lady King-Hall is still addicted
to charming hats. She broke the Union
Jack outside the Stock Exchange on Em-
pire Day in a cream gown top-dressed by
an elegant black-feathered chapeau. The
day being too wet for really good feathers
to come out with safety, I suppose it was a
sacrificial offering to the august memory of
Victoria, whose excruciating taste in bon-
nets was almost a vice and a good part of
a nightmare.
The Denmans had to lay a City Mission
foundation stone on Saturday afternon (a
serious rite) instead of going to the ’Varsity
Undergrads’ circus in the Great Hall of the
Uni. A dark suspicion that the G.-G.
would much rather have missed the Chan-
cellor’s annual dreariness on Thursday and
substituted the Undergrads’ gay perform-
ance on Saturday, is oozing through Philis-
tine circles. It is whispered in Gath, and
the Askelon Sunday paper mentioned it.
The presentation of the Longstaff portrait
of Professor MacCallum at the Senate’s gilt-
edged Commem. was the only item of in-
terest. This picture of MacCallum in his
Academic frills was, perhaps, the best of
the series of portraits painted by the famous
John during his hurried 1911 gallop through
oils in this city.
Another feature of the Senate’s solemn
service in the Uni’s Great Hall was the
leading up of the Denmans to the pictures
of Benefactors. Her Ex., in the latest no-
tail ermine coat, confronting the oiled like-
ness (I think) of the late Mrs. Russell
(wasn’t she the wife of Peter?), who stared
back in another ermine coat (the old-fash-
ioned kind with black tails), was a quaint
parable in peltry. The Painted Lady, for
obvious reasons, was unable to excuse her-
self to the Flesh Lady for being out of the
fashion.
Yours in mere tweed,
VANDORIAN.
ROBUR
When you’ve been selling
food-stuffs for years, as 1 have,
you get to know the things that
are good and those that are
not, for you’ve not only your
own judgement to depend on
—but the hundreds of customers
who come in every day tell you
what they think, and should
you happen to put a line into
stock that’s not up to the mark,
it’s not long before they let you
know about it. Likewise, when
an article is good, somebody
will be sure to mention it.
Now “Robur” tea is one
of the best selling lines I’ve
ever stocked, the quality doesn’t
vary, the flavour is always good
and the same people seem to
buy it from one year’s end to
another, excepting now and then
when a new customer has to
be added to the list. It’s the
hardest tea to change people
from, and you can bet I’ve tried a
good many times because the
profit is less upon it than any
other tea 1 sell.
Some customers say the No.
3 Grade is good enough for
anybody and whilst there’s no
doubt about its being good, if
1 had to recommend I’d say
for everyday family use take
the No. 2 Grade.
The Grocer.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, May 27, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The rehearsals of the Empire Pageant last
week were hindered by the distinguished
friends and relatives of the illustrious ama-
teurs engaged, who crowded along to watch
and criticise. The stage management stood
the infliction for a time; then one morning
it closed the doors in the faces of the in-
vaders, and turned a relentless ear to the
pathetic outcry they made on the mat.
The precious Pageant, which took the
form of a benefit performance in aid of the
Empire Union—l beg pardon, League— was
dressed largely in the alleged fashion of bad
Queen Bess’s day, and its designers are
whispered to be waiting for their furious
loyalty to be recognised by the British
Authorities. The spectacle itself was let
loose at the Princess’s on Friday afternoon.
Everybody whose existence Toorak admits
came along in his or her best clothes to
stalls or circle. The gallery was packed
with Boy Scouts and other small loyal nuis-
ances who shrilled patriotic songs during
the intervals. One big improvised box in
the centre of the circle contained all the
official people. The Fuller lady, in black
drapings and a hat wreathed with white
flowers (rather a funereal guise), was in
sole command of half her blue-clad house-
hold infantry. John Madden sat and beamed
alongside his dame, who flaunted a gay and
coquettish toque of pink roses. Mrs. Davey,
enveloped in a magnificent sealskin coat, had
daughter Mrs. Charlie Armstrong for com-
pany. That neat, navy-tailored young
woman’s place in the audience was marked
by smart white aigrettes which shot into the
air like white rockets or frozen fountain-
jets. Mrs. Albert Miller and Miss Secre-
tary Chomley were also packed into the
capacious social stockyard, the inmates of
which all went along to the Alexandra Club
for tea after the thirsty show.
Enid Derham was responsible for the talk-
ing part of the play. The principal charac-
ter naturally was Mrs. Britannia, and she
got through much excitement and high falut-
in’ before she mounted her property throne.
The tall and handsome Vera Deakin, in
trailing robes and silver armor, filled the
part and spoke the lines in a way befitting
the daughter of Alfred. Lesly Madden posed
as Newfoundland, and Vavi Dodds as
ITrance. Vanda Clarke, the tall Mt. Schank
heiress, acted for Canada. The Pinschof
girls both had good roles, and Miss Brem-
ner, as India, did a good deal of singing.
Mrs. Collins made a magnificent America.
Pretty little Marie Stirling warbled as a
Maoriland shepherdess, with flautist Ama-
dio, arrayed in a sheepskin, at her feet.
Gerald Fitzmaurice (a youth with such a
name simply could not be omitted from an
Empire function) baritoned finely as Dis-
covery. Mrs. Ewart’s music, with jingo
tunes entwined, set the crowd on fire, and
at the end 1000 kids frantically waved flags
and shrieked “Gorsave” and “Fool Britan-
nia that she still rules the waves.” At least
that is what might have been safely bel-
lowed under cover of the awful noise. As
usual, the loyal, cheap and well-inflated bun
rewarded the red-faced infants at the con-
clusion of their shriek.
The fashionable Alexandra Club was
shaken to the very depths of its muff at a
recent committee meeting. It appears that
the temporary members (who only pay a
miserable ss. per month for their privileges)
have been entertaining their friends in the
cosy quarters, and generally using the place
as a tea saloon instead of a salon. Someone
urged that these outsiders should only be
allowed to entertain themselves, and be
asked to pay 10s. Mrs. John Madden and
the ethereal Mrs. Harold Kent hotly de-
bated the point—the former vigorously de-
fending the Five-Bobbers. However, she
lost the day, and the outsiders, in future,
are to pay half a sovereign, and feed their
friends elsewhere.
Caulfield, where Mrs. Fisken is mayoress,
is to have a dance of great splendor on
July 16. Presumably it has been signalled
early, in order that the frock builder may be
given due warning.
The women associates who enjoy a limited
run of the Melbourne Golf Links have been
indulging of late in tournaments. Mrs.
Theil, the big, handsome wife of Dewar
Theil, won the Elder last Wednes-
day, after a hard batlle with May Bell, who
is a good match player. Dr. Deravin’s sis-
ter was also in the finals or thereabouts, and
Miss Tolhurst was not far away. Mrs.
Theil’s win caused a wild waving of brassies
and other agricultural implements.
A daring society charmer says joyfully
of the Arabian Nights dance: “It is the
chance I have been waiting for to show off
my figure, and I ? ll use it!” You will have
to wait until next week for the description
of her dress.
Captain Bowwater, brother to London’s
Gaud Mayor and nephew to G. M. Davey,
arrived in Melbourne last week, and fled
straight through to Sydney. He will be
back here in time for the Arabian Nights
dance and a heavyweight mayoral reception.
After these festivities, our civic couple will
make for Sydney.
Lady Duff-Gordon (“Lucile”) who, by
all accounts, was taking no unnecessary
chances in the Titanic wreck, is a sister of
novelist Elinor Glyn. The fancy names she
bestows on her champion efforts in the gown-
designing line suggest that she shares her
literary relative’s eye for the sensational.
A garment of bronze satin, purple chiffon
and gold and silver embroideries staggered
London society under the somewhat medi-
cinal title “Herb Moon,” but “Vain Re-
grets” (which was not built of sackcloth
and ashes, although you might think it),
“Apple Orchard,” “Beacon Fires” and
“Dawn of a Happier Day” ran it pretty
close.
There recently arrived from India a tall;
burnt-up official called Judge Russell. He
selected Connac, Toorak, as a promising
place to rest in and restore his impaired
liver. Connac, which used to add rental to
the well-filled Baillieu exchequer, is now the
property of Mrs. James Collins, ma-in-law
to manager Quinlan, of the Opera Co.
Mrs. Rubber Edwards had a fall the other
day and injured her back. By doctor’s
orders she is now lying quite still, and has
cancelled a prospective Sydney trip and a
birthday party in honor of the two babies.
Half the nurseries of Melbourne broke out
into open mutiny when the doleful news
went round.
In the first week in June, the sporting
Herbert Power will support his white-
tailored niece Jessie to the sacrificial altar
of matrimony, and stand by while she is
made Mrs. Wood. The subsequent feast will
be spread at Coolullah, the Jack Grices’
Toorak place, and only the family will eat
of it. Mrs. Grice is one of the Power clan,
so she will not be excluded.
Rupert Clarke, accompanied by 10 black
steel trunks, has departed to Papua to have
another look at his rubber and fibre invest-
ments. The Clarke lady meanwhile is com-
fortably secluded in Lanark, the old Wal-
lace house in Queen’s-road.
Erciidoune, the Lady Sarah Wilson sta-
tion which has sheltered Melba and various
vice-regal tenants in the long intervals be-
tween the owner’s Australian visits, is to be
let again. The wealthy Gardiners, of Bal-
larat, are likely to move in very soon and
take possession of the garden, birds and two
miles of carriage drives.
Mrs. Phyllis Clarke-Power, wrapped in a
platypus coat and carrying a ditto rug, de-
scended on Melbourne the other day from
the Murray-side station dad bought her. She
had with her, in addition to the furs, pretty
Dorrie Parker, who has just regretfully
turned down the offer of a trip abroad to
join the travelling Powers. The Arabian
Nights dance is the business they have come
about.
Poor Freddie Beard never lived to hear
the odes of welcome his women’s choir was
practising against the day of his return.
He developed appendicitis on the homeward-
bound liner, where an operation probably
would have entailed too much risk. He
was treated until he could be put ashore at
Colombo, but the surgeon came too late to'
save him.
A bride, whose nice, fat dowry was bagged
during several successful potato and onion
seasons, has struck a sad experience at the
outset of her housekeeping. She sent all her
presents, valuables and spare clothing to the
new home at Geelong, while she and hex-
bridegroom wedding-tripped. During this
period, the burglar pounced hawklike with
several vans and absolutely cleaned out the
place! When the pair arrived, they were
met by a thin, shocked cat, which inquired
in a peevish way when it was going to be
supplied with a hearthrug and a fire to purr
at. Somehow, one does not expect this sort
of thing in Geelong.
The “Talma” Weedon family will enliven
the dull month of June by marrying off one
of their sons, Alfred H., to Miss Vere Henry,
daughter of Dr. Louis Henry, of this city.
The ceremony will transpire on the 10th,
and will be celebrated in the evening at the
Paris cafe, where victuals will be torn until
a late hour.
Lalla Miranda, who was a slim girl when
she left here 16 years ago, has returned a
woman of fine physique. Blue-black hair
(glossy and parted in the middle), bright
blue eyes, and a red-tinted olive complexion,
make her a picture good to look at. And, of
course, she talks interestingly. She has not
sung in English for years. French and
Italian are her usual singing languages;
but she. never attempts German. Once, ac-
companied by her inseparable companion,
Mrs. Henrikson, she went to Berlin to study,
and was offered a good engagement to sing
there and in Vienna. But the necessity for
using the guttural tongue resolved her to let
the contract go. “It is so easy to sing in
Italian,” she pleads in extenuation. But,
then, Lalla is one of the fortunate ones who
can pick and choose. She is engaged per-
manently at the Grand Opera, Paris, from
which she has been granted leave of absence
for six months. She wanted to make it
eight, in order that she might visit South
Africa. But it could not be arranged. The
singer’s home-coming has been full of excite-
ment, despite the fact that her relations have
left Australia. Her very English mother
has returned to her own country, where
sister Beatrice, now married, is also located.
Since her arrival, she has been motoring
about in all directions, looking at Australia.
The Gaud Mayor and his Gaudess lured
Lalla Miranda, last week, into a corner of
the incomplete Town Hall, where some 40
enthusiastic friends were gathered together
to tender her an informal welcome. The
Best knight, who was engineer-in-chief of
her Melbourne send-off concert in the long
ago, turned up with a friendly speech full of
reminiscent anecdote. Few people know that
Best himself has a voice with which musical
sounds as well as political speeches may be
made. There is such a thing in his posses-
sion, and David Miranda was his trainer in
the long ago.
At the friendly Town Hall function, Lal-
la’s .fine neck was encircled by a Marie An-
toinette collar (a spiky lace thing said to
have been worn by the late uncomfortable
and. amputated Queen), which some adoring
Parisienne presented to the songstress re-
cently. On her dress (a dream of mole color
and rose du Barri brocade) were historical
buttons—brilliants that once belonged to
Louis XV. The shining buttons seemed to
wink at the. unrelenting collar with a sort
of ‘‘Such is life!” expression.
It is rumored that Melba is going to adopt
pretty Sylvia Ffrench, her constant com-
panion for many moons.
The whirligig of time has brought pung-
ent topical interest to one of the verses of
a duet that Florence Young and Roberts
sing in “The Cingalee.” On Saturday night,
whilst duetting in “You and I,” they broke
up the house with an allusion to the de-
lights of getting one’s name into the papers.
Ihe titter started at the back of the d.c.
and spread into a laugh all round. The
singers seemed to be comparatively late ar-
rivals at the point of the joke, and even then
their faces never relaxed further than a
faint smile. If Florence did actually wink
at Reginald the movement of the eyelid was
brief and business-like. When they took an
encore they didn’t repeat that verse about
newspaper reports. By the way, the looked-
tor Lalla Miranda was not spotted by her
old admirers on Saturday at Her Majesty’s.
Iwo adjacent boxes contained the inevitable
Whitings and the Bland Holts—the head-
gear of Mrs. B. 11. looking like a notion
tor the Kismet Ball—but the prima donna
was not with either party.
Most people know by experience that the
marriage feast is now not a thing to ap-
proach with a healthy appetite. It consists,
in many cases, of 45 cheers, two sandwiches,
a glass or so of champagne, and a heap of
contusion. The other day, at a big society
marrying, where the food was spread at a
big hotel, the usual small sandwich turned
up brightly, and with a little help from jel-
lies and cakes put up the bluff of being a
banquet. . The muttering multitude sat
down to this fare and ate it sullenly. Cham-
pagne fizzed expensively; but glasses were
scarce, and the less pushful men in the back-
ground had some difficulty in getting the
means to drink the healths. One or two are
said to have shouted dry-mouthed and
quaffed like chorus hands from empty
glasses. The guests finally rushed away full
of nothing but fury.
The prevailing food shortage looks like
causing trouble in another department of
somal life. That rare and beautiful animal,
the dancing man, is now striking for less
capers and more vittles. Lie positively re-
fuses to bound and hop unless he is given
shorter hours, less bounding and more fod-
der. A recent dance had to be cancelled be-
cause he wasn’t sure that the refreshments
would be adequate.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Mr. T. S. Reed, who is, at the time of writing,
hard at work at the Public Library, rearranging the
books of the York Gate Library, reached the tidy age
°i 9 f on Wednesday. He is a keen fisherman, and trots
on to Tasmania by himself, on angling bent, every
year, like the mere boy he is.
Talking of the Public Library, the place has lately
captured some Government House despatches, dated
from 1837 onwards.
A . business-like variety of jester is prospering ex-
ceedingly. I mean the sort who wears a mask and
a jemmy. Almost every day houses are being
burgled, and citizens held up at the point of the re-
volver. . Capital is changing hands at a terrific rate.
The police seem about as much use in the matter as
so many corpses.
From Shanghai comes news that Mrs. Godfrey,
daughter of the Imperial Owen Smyth, is doing glit-
tering things as a golfer. Shall I be accused of
over-booming my native land if I mention—a tear
of pride dimming my eye the while—that the lady
learnt to “goff” at the Adelaide Golf Club?
The Mayor’s Ball is booked for the Exhibition Build-
ing on July 10. The Denmans and Brigadier-General
Gordon, who has a host of friends here, will be
present, under the protecting wing of the Bosanquets.
F. K. Archer, an old St. Peter’s boy, has just
taken a First Class at the Lincoln’s Inn Bar exam., and
was third in order of merit. He was to have been
“called” on May 1.
Our high-tariff new Grand Central goes one better
than the mere published list of “guests.” It fol-
lows that conventional bit of puffery with “Arriving:
So and So.” The first notice (or thereabouts)
bundled things together in a delightfully frank man-
ner: “All the leading members of the J. C. William-
son Comic Opera and Chapman-Alexander com-
panies.”
The Chapman-Alexander troupe has suffered dire
loss. No less than three of the stars are laid up
with accidents and so on. These humble bringers of
Salvation are lodged frugally at the Grand Central
Hotel. They would probably have slept under a
hedge, or in a haystack, but none are available just
now.
There died at Woodville, on Sunday, the Rev. T.
Blackburn, 8.A., scientist and theologian. He was
well known to students of natural history, and ranked
high as an entomologist.
Preparations are afoot for the Flower Ball, which
is dub to roll in the Exhibition Building on June 26.
There will be 29 sets, each with its own herald, and
the final march past of these gaudy persons is ex-
pected to paralyse all observers.
Miss Gladys Box has gone for a visit to Sydney.
Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell Fowler returned there on
Monday. Mrs. A. McCulloch and Miss Eileen Beres-
ford have returned from Melbourne.
Mrs. Lungley gave a smallish dance at Lexden,
North Adelaide, on Thursday evening. Mr. Lungley
ig away in England, and his brother-in-law, Mr.
Frank Irwin, did the honors in his place.
The Rev. W. H. Winter staged some scenes from
his play, “Queen Elizabeth,” at the Lyric Club, on
May 24. Clever Mrs. Powis Stuart took the name-
part.
The Mayor has issued invitations for a Children’s
Ball on July 12.
W. T. Stead, whose Julia must have been
asleep when he sent her his wireless while
the Titanic was sinking, is making up for
the lost journalistic scoop by communicating
with Mrs. Charles Bright, of East Mel-
bourne. His latest message sets at rest any
doubt as to the destination of Stead’s soul.
Not only has he arrived safely in Paradise,
but he was received, apparently, with a
band and a full guard of honor of cherubim
scouts, and “the whole phalanx of angels
and friends,” and triumphantly “led to a
home that had been preparing for me all my
life.” Evidently the doings of Stead on
earth had been keenly followed by the readers
of the Paradise for in this
palatial home there were “on the walls re-
presentations of everything I had done in
earth life, of help to unfortunates, help in
reform. The help in spreading the great
fact of immortal life was represented more
fully than anything else.” Let me see, was
it Stead, or a Carpenter in Nazareth, who
spread that information? N« matter! The
main fact is that he is now Saint Stead. He
was interviewed, of course, and naturally he
interviewed Heaven. “Angelic beings had
evidently been instructed to meet me, and
every question I asked was answered by an
angel guide into whose care I was placed.”
And there is no false modesty about the new
saint. “Here we realise what it is to be
among our spiritual peers.” But wait till
Saint Stead starts publishing “The Cheru-
bim Tribute of New Jerusalem”! And I
hope there will be no scandal in Paradise
when he meets Julia.
Yours affectionately,

The latest Grand Guignol (Paris) “shocker” claims
to be the record in thrills. A vaccinated regiment
has all been inoculated with plague by mistake!
There is only one thing to be done. Another regi-
ment is called in, the barracks doors are fastened,
and the whole of the first lot are shot down in cold
blood, making such an unarmed fight as they can
meanwhile. The authors, being French, have placed
this pleasing incident in a German setting.

fOR THE BENEFIT
OF DYSPEPTICS.
This Woman Speaks of Treatment that
Cured Her.
Couldn’t Eat the Lightest Food Without
Suffering—Became Pale and Weak
with Attacks of Neuralgia.
This is an account of a woman who suf-
fered agony with indigestion; whose blood
was thin and watery and who had bad at-
tacks of neuralgia. Of course the thin blood
was the cause of all the trouble. After she
had tried many medicines that did her no
good, she began to take l)r. Williams’ Pink
Pills. She found that they increased her
blood supply, and that at tne same time the
indigestion, neuralgia and heart palpitation
disappeared. Other people have found the
same thing. It shows how the health of
the whole body depends on the richness of
the blood, and how curing the cause of the
trouble cures the complaint. This woman,
Mrs. Matilda Randall, of Crombie Street,
Milton, Brisbane, made the following state-
ment for the benefit of other sufferers:
“After an attack of pneumonia,” she said,
“I began to suffer a great deal with indiges-
tion, and the food lay heavily on my chest.
I took only the lightest of things, such as
soups and milk foods, for all solids seemed
to choke me and they wouldn’t go down for
hours. My limbs hadn’t any strength in
them, and I felt as if they were giving way
under me, and I also felt so weak, heavy
and drowsy. All the color went out of my
face and-lips. I fell away and got very thin
and sallow; I craved for acids, such as
lemons and vinegar and water. My blood
itself seemed nothing but water, for when
I cut my finger hardly any blood trickled. I
got twinges of neuralgia in the face and
temples that made me perfectly wretched
and so unstrung. I mostly lay down when
I could, and had to get outside help, for 11
weeks. I was too weak to do a hand’s turn.
My heart would start to race furiously, even
when I was lying still, and I had to avoid
all exertion and excitement. My ankles
swelled with standing, and my feet always
felt stony cold. At times I fainted riaht
off. At last I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
and a steady course strengthened my nerves
and enriched my blood. I took three a dav.
and even the neighbors remarked how much
better I was looking. I shook off all the
weakness, my appetite picked up and the
. headaches and neuralgia disappeared,., I re-
gard this medicine as a grand tonic.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by all
dealers, but if in doubt send to the Dr. Wil-
liams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia, Ltd.,

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Curse o’ Moses”: It seems as if Provi-
dence has been going out of its way recently
to impress upon the inhabitants of Austra-
lasia the absurdity of Party Government.
In N.S.W. we saw the desperate engineer-
ing of the Labor crowd to hang on to office
with a majority of one, or, at best, two
votes, while the business of the country was
shelved. In Maoriland the Pawnshop multi-
tude was saved by the casting vote of the
Speaker from being pitched out, and there
also business has been hung up. And now
the foolery is going to be exposed some more
in Tasmania.
THE COW IS GREATER THAN B.-P.
(Scene: Inspection of boy scouts at Cow-country
railway siding.)
COWBOY SCOUT: “ Please, Mister , we was all
that could come. The other blokes sez would
yer mind callin’ some time they ain't
milkin'?”
A condensed statement of the case:—
The Victorian Political Labor Council is picking
candidates for the Senate, with a good chance of get-
ting three in again. Senior Edward Russell (there
are two Russells, the other being William of S.A.)
is the only Labor man who retires. The other two
are Tories —McColl and Simon Fraser. Simcm of
Nova Scotia makes his final and complete exit. He
is 80 years of age, so it may be described as a fair
thing. The Political Labor Council has 30 names
among its Senatorial nominations, with Russell at
the bottom of the list. There is a certain prejudice
against him on the ground that he has already col-
lected about £3OOO in salary, and it is time for
somebody else to have a show. That is a foolish
sort of argument. The fact that he has collected
£3OOO or so in salary only signifies that he has had
time to collect experience. If a limit is set to the
aggregate salary a man may earn in the public ser-
vice the country’s only good general might reach
the fatal figure in the middle of a battle, and be
promptly retired by the auditor, who would hand him
his last day’s pay, and bid him make all possible
skurry to the rear.
[James Edmond, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
PARTY POLITICS CONDENSED.
PARTY POLITICIAN: “ What are you—a sheep or
a goat?”
THE KOOKABURRA: “I’m neither; I'm a bird.”
PARTY POLITICIAN: “Don't be ridiculous; you
must be one or the other.”
“Mr. James’s” young men give the show
away sometimes. Thus the Sydney Mail,
talking of J. W. Ivirwan, of Westralia, mar-
ried the other day, in Sydney, to ex-Speaker
Quinlan’s daughter, mentioned that, “al-
though a pronounced Freetrader, he has
strong Democratic tendencies.” That young
man struck an immortal truth when his
boss wasn’t looking.
“Geofred” : Meek, M.L.C., of the A.M.P.,
has just announced that “Though the cost
will be enormous (some thousands of
pounds) the A.M.P. has decided to give
each and every one of its clerks a small in-
crease in wages.” The reason given for this
step is that clerks “have no redress
against the ever-increasing cost of living,
for, whilst primary producers and merchams
can put up their prices, clerks have no way
of meeting the high living prices.” This is
the same Meek who, in the N.S.W. Upper
House, last year, worked hard and success-
fully to throw clerks out of the schedule of
the' Arbitration Bill, on the ground that
their pay was excellent and they had no
grievances.
The biggest present idea of the
Victorian Watt Ministry is its
Main Roads Bill. The local land-
owner who constitutes most of the
local government bodies hates so
much to tax himself that rather
than pay even a moderate rate he
is steadily allowing many of the
highways to drift towards com-
plete obliteration. In fact, he ap-
parently wants to get back to
savagery. So the Watt Govern-
ment proposes to create a Central
Road Board with subsidiary Dis-
trict Boards, to rescue 17,380
miles of public pathway from ob-
livion.
For the first time in nearly 22
years there has been a contest for
the Upper House seat for the
south-western province (Vic.).
The ancient deadness of the House
of Rich Landlords is such that when
a Fossil gets a seat he generally keeps
it unmolested for life. And if the
lion, member were stuffed he might go
on keeping it even longer than that —-
with careful dusting, of course. In
fact, unless thieves broke in and stole
the stuffed gentleman during the re-
cess, he might last for centuries.
“G.V.W ” : An influx of Chinese to Christ-
church (M.L.) has threatened the local
cabinet-making business with devastation.
To keep the trade “white,” employers and
employees have formed themselves into a
joint army of protection. And a number of
the alarmed persons who are shouting for
the expulsion of the Chow cabine.-maker, on
the ground that he is a danger, are aggres-
sive opponents of the compulsory military
defence scheme for the preservation of the
country from the armed Chow soldier. He,
it seems, isn’t a danger.
A recent article in the Oxford and Cam-
bridge Review, written by one Sir \\ lliiam
Bull, a Tory M.P., tells the listening ear of
England that at the election of 1911 a new
Australian House of Reps was formed con-
sisting of 41 Laborites, 30 Fusiomsts,
and 20 Independents. This well-informed
person didn’t even get the date of the elec-
tion correctly.
Liberalism is up against a tough problem
in S.A. Senator Josiah Syrnon, always an
unmanageable horse in the team, has bolted,
with the harness dragging behind him. He
has apparently decided not to Fuse any
longer, and will probably run as an Inde-
pendent. If the Liberals put up three
Fused candidates Symon will then make
four, and the splitting of the vote may be
fatal. Yet it will be gall and wormwood
and a grievous walking on all fours to put
Symon on the Fused ticket if he scorns the
ticket and all its works.
“Comrade” Holland, who
was fined £lOO for refusing
to permit his son to attend
drill as a cadet, has failed
in an attempt to persuade
N.S.W. Full Court to upset
the conviction. He appealed
on seven grounds, and the
Court blew him out on six.
The seventh was that he
had been fined £lOO by the
magistrate, in the erroneous
belief that he had no power
to make the penalty less.
The Court found for the
“Comrade” on this ground,
but pointed out that it was
Holland’s own counsel who
insisted on the magistrate
imposing the maximum fine
under the Act, though he
(the beak) had proposed to
charge only £lO. Yielding
tn the nremments of COUU-
ro me argumems or coun-
sel, however, the magistrate raised the
contribution to £lOO, when Holland had the
gall to plead by counsel that this mistake
on the part of the Bench was sufficient to
upset the conviction. The Full Court re-
mitted the case back to the magistrate, with
an intimation that a fine of something less
than £lOO would meet the bluff.
The British revolution, or whatever the
affair is called, still goes on. At latest ad-
vices 120,000 transport workers have struck
in London, that port is completely tied up,
and an all-round railway strike is among the
possibilities of the near future. The rail-
way worker of the United Kingdom is
always on the verge of strike. Here is a
brief summary of liow he has been getting
on during the last four years, for which
figures are available :
Companies’ Number of Average
Net earnings. Employees. Weekly Wage.
1907 .. £44,939,729 478,690 £1 ss. lOd.
1910 . . 47,355,889 463,019 1 ss. 9d.
More traffic, fewer employees to handle it,
and less wages per employee—these three
things sum up the trouble. And when the
average wage is 255. 9d. per week, what kind
of wage does the man at the bottom get?
THE ALLY OF LIBERALISM.
Thus William McMillan at Sydney Cafe
on Empire Day :
If British people were to maintain anything worth
calling an empire, they must be absolutely consoli-
dated. There could be only one navy.
There is something rather splendid about
the spectacle of this lonely little linen-
draper ranging himself on the local navy
question in stark opposition to the British
Admiralty authorities and pretty well every
other naval expert of any eminence that has
discussed the matter.
Australia is not in the least degree likely
to follow Maoriland’s example and attach
its big warship to the British fleet in the
North Sea. Andrew Fisher doesn’t want
either a peerage or a baronetcy, so far a?
this country is aware.
THE LATEST AND THE BEST
Remedy for Chest Complaints is Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery for Coughs and Colds. It is effective
when all else fails. Price, Is. 6d. and 3s.*
Tom Mann, while awaiting trial, was the
hero of a vast demonstration in Trafalgar-
square, London, where he was described as
“the man who made Australia what it is.”
And there is no evidence that the useless and
thundering old Beer-Thomas objected to
the amazing lie.
WATT,
VICTORIA’S
NEW
PREMIER.
In Tasmania’s House of Ass. just now
the Lewis party and the Larle party are
equal, or will be when a Speaker is ap-
pointed, and Norman Cameron is the odd
man. He has great ideas about Ins position
as the solitary Independent. He asks for
the Premiership vice Neil Lewis (to be de-
posed), the Lands portfolio for himself, and
the Treasury for his friend Whitsitt. The
other two billets the rest of the party can
have. If his demands are not complied
with, Enormous Cameron will put the Labor
men in power, and if they don’t act to suit
him he will put them out again. It is a fine
programme. But suppose the House grew
tired, and a temporary Lewis-Earle Minis-
try was formed with just one item on its
policy:—
That Abnormal Cameron be honorably expelled
and disqualified on a charge of well-meaning im-
practicability and unavoidable swelled head!
In short, he might be charged with being
a big man in his own estimation that
he was making the island tip up. Another
method would be to combine the present
Council and Assembly in one body and
create a new Second Chamber consisting
solely of Norman Cameron. There is a pre-
cedent. The Hungarian House of Magnates
once got down low that it consisted of a
single Magnate, and he had to mag single-
handed, so to speak.
THE GOOD SHIP AUSTRALIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Storm upon the open sea, camerados!
I see the good ship, Australia —clipper built, full-
rigged, copper-bottomed, £300,000,000 at
Cohen-Lloyds !
The good ship Australia is under all sail; everything
is set alow and aloft!
All plain sail, to’gallant sails, royals, moon-rakers,
skyscrapers and angels’ wings!
Starboard and port, her studding sails are boomed
out, camerados!
Every extra jib in the locker is rigged, and still
the skipper and the afterguard yell: “All hands
make sal!”
Is it not madness, camerados —sheer, blithering, mid-
summer, marine lunacy ?
Hark to the chantey, echoing up from the decks of
the good ship Australia!
Oh, shake her up and shake her free !
Yeo-110 ! Yeo-ho !
A reckless, feckless crew are we!
Ye-o-o-o-110 !
It’s mainsail haul, my bully boys all!
We’re bound away where the Cohens call!
(All together— Yeo-IIo! Yee-llee !)
And Davy Jones may collect our loans,
Or boil Posterity down for its bones •
In the deep Financial Sea!
See, camerados, the watch on deck is hoisting another
loan !
Yet there is storm upon the sea!
The good ship Australia is making heavy weather of
it —
What will she do when it begins to blow?
Will the watch below reduce sail?
Or will it emulate the lunatic watch on deck?
Somebody will have to save the ship!
Will you save the ship, camerados?
Or will you let the crew clap on more sail until
the squall strikes her, and she lies dismasted
at the mercy of the waves?
Where are the owners of the good ship Australia?

THREAD WORMS EXPEDITED.
BY COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
Mrs. M. Johnson, 135 Elizabeth Stfedt,
Wellington, N.Z., writes“Permit me to
express my grateful appreciation of the value
of your Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pel-
lets. My little girl, aged _ three years, was
very bad, continually picking her nose, ■ and
jumping about in her sleep at nights, till she
was afraid of being left alone night or day.
My husband, after bringing home different
so-called remedies and ‘certain cures,’ all of
no earthly good, decided to give Comstock’s
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets a fair trial. I
smiled when I saw what he had, as I was
sick and tired of trying to cure the poor
child. After taking the first dose, the result
was marvellous; she must have been simply
alive with worms. I continued the treat-
ment, giving her a pellet in the morning and
a teaspoonful of castor oil at night, and I
am pleased to say that she is thoroughly
cured, and has had no return of the symp-
toms.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal _ preparation for
the eradication of Worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 2s. 9d. per packet, or will be
sent post paid at the same price by the W.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
What in thunder is the matter with the
newspapers? Take the style of headline we have
been getting of late, headlines that shriek: —
COLLAPSE OF THE AUSTRALIANS.
Foiir Men Make Nine Million (more or less).
The Rest, 15 (One Short),
or words to that effect. It is not the Australian
Eleven but the Australian daily newspaper that dis-
plays capacity for “rot.” When a few of the
earlier batsmen have hoisted a mountain of runs on
the board in the first innings, it is‘ sheer folly for
the others to take up a big proportion of the very
limited time available under a tnree-days limit, in
piling up unnecessary and cumbering runs for the
sake.pf the individual averages. In many cases it
would mean throwing away a certain win. If the
Australian XI were merely a gang of average-grab-
bers,,-instead of a combined and disciplined team out
to win as early and as often as possible, despite the
limit ■of three days for at least three innings, then
the -bjoques who followed the heavy scorers might
bat their darndest. And the result would be colossal
scores; with the word “Draw” at the end of things.
Twice already Gregory and Co. have been represented
in howling; headlines as “eollapsers,” and the ancient
crowd which called itself “The Players” has sobbed
loudly over the “awful string of failures.” Rabbits!
Also,. balderdash! In each case runs were not
wanted from (he failures or anybody else —but what
was Wanted most urgently was time in which to
scora a comfortable victory, even if the opposition
stuck, hard. And the “failures” succeeded brilliantly
in playing up to the occasion by not performing
beyonfi it. No doubt it was in accordance with the
instructions of “General Syd.” And that they did
the tiring that tactics required of them, argues well for
the discipline of the team. There have been Australian
teams in which batsmen wasted precious time in
doggedly pursuing the flash “average.” Roy Min-
nett,: in his first three innings in England, made 18,
11, I,' and then stood out of two matches. Jennings
started with 3, 51, 17, 26 n. 0., and 11. Yet Minnett
was picked against M.C.C., and Jennings was
dropped. In that match, limited to three days,
Minnett contributed a first-innings blob, and the air
was filled with sobs over his lost form. Charlie
Kelleway, prior to the M.C.C. inatch, had presented
Australia fidth 1 and 0, just when little or nothing
was required of him but to get out quickly. But
in the M.C.C. match he made 24 (run out), his side
having already about 300 on the board against the
Club’ff 169. In the second appearance Australia’s
stars rfell cheaply, Bardsley dropping from 137 to
27 in the match, and Macartney from 74 to 20.
Gregory had vanished for a blob, and Mayne for five,
so runs Were wanted. The eollapsers of previous
turns' had their chance, and rose to the occasion.
Minnett made 64 ; Kelleway 30 n. 0., and little Mat-
thews, of St. Kilda, Vic., chipped in with 18 n. 0.,
and, despite the early crash, Australia won with the
loss of five wickets. It is excellent generalship. By
the, end, with reasonable luck, it may be found that
the (“non-representative team,” the “crude crowd
with Buckley’s chance,” etc., will be among the most
successful ;of the Australian Elevens. Anyhow, the
menC\are playing the game the occasion demands.
Tfie Australian record, up till Tuesday last, was
won five and lost one. The solitary defeat was that
by Notts, by six wickets. The wins are North Hants,
by an innings and 64 runs; Essex, an innings and
132 runs; Surrey, seven wickets and two runs;
Marylebone Cricket Club, five wickets and three runs;
Oxford University, 10 wickets. Incidentally, Aus-
tralia had scored 448 in the first Test v. Africa; and
downed one African wicket for 16. On the other
hand, the South 'African, team has won three, lost
one, andj made drawn games of two. , It
beat Derbyshire by seven wickets; Surrey by 52
runs; and Worcester by an innings and 42 runs. It
was defeated by Marylebone by 108 runs, and drew
with Yorkshire . and Oxford University. The Aus-
tralian averages are better in both bowling and bat-
ting .than those of the Africans. Macartney, after
the Oxford match, had played nine innings, carried
his bat once, and held as his average 85.75. Bards-
ley had carried his bat twice, and made 74.57 for
each of his lost wickets. Nourse, at the top of the
African list, had in 11 innings carried his bat twice,
but had made only 38.88 for each wicket, and Harti-
gan had played in eight innings, kept his timber
once, and made 32.57 for each wicket. Macartney
and Emery, the best of Australia’s bowlers, had
taken their wickets for 11.57 and 14.76 runs respect-
ively, while Faulkner and Pegler. the crack. Africans,
had 13.94 and 14.09 scored for each of theirs.
Cricket expert Joe Davis summed it up in this form:
Runs. Wickets. Average.
Australia .. .. .. 2467 71 34.60
S’Africa ' 2180 #95 22.94
English versus Australia . . 2266 113, 20.08
Epglish versus Africa .. 2266 196 21.37
Or exactly the same number of runs scored against
both teams, with a difference of seven wickets in
favor of Australia. All of which is eminently satis-
factory.
The one weakness of the Australian team is its
tendency to give away “Sundries.” It is a fearful
leaks and must be blocked up somehow. In the half-
dozen matches Australia has presented the other
teams with 248 runs, and received in return but
113—which, is deplorable.
•**- * _ *
Sydney Telegraph has had wretched luck
wiith its cricket prophecies. When the team went
smash in the first match the Telegraph heaved a
brick, but before the brick reached its mark the
team had begun to do wonders. Last week, when
R,oy Minnett fell for a duck in the first innings
against the M.C.C., the paper remarked: “The match
has again exemplified that Minnett, from whom a lot
was expected, has again, failed to fulfil expectations.”
But its ink wasn’t dry when a cable came through
that the M.C.C. had been squelched, and Minnett
had put together a brilliant 64 out of a total of 169
for five wickets. The cricket tipster has as hard a
row to hoe as fie who pickets an ’orse, and his path
is dogged by as many dangers as that M the Masked
Burglar.
* * * *
, As this issue goes to press the first Test,
Australia versus South Africa, is raging at Man-
chester (England). The Australians went to the
timber first, and made a magnificent start, scoring
runs at the rate of about three for every two
minutes. The Australian innings ended for 448, of
Which Kelleway hoisted 114 and Bardsley 121.
Gregory contributed a reasonable 37, Jennings 32,
Whitty 33, and little Matthews carried his bat for
49. The S’Afrieans sent in Taylor and Hartigan.
Hazlitt and Whitty bowled, and Whitty, in his first
oVer, got Taylor, who just touched a ball, and was
caught at the wicket by Carkeek. Nourse came out
to Hartigan, and together they saw the day to the
end with 16 on the board for the loss of one wicket.
But, all the same, great as was the Australian glory,
African bowler Pegler was the man on whom the
real limelight fell. The cables say that the Aus-
tralians collared the bowling; but Pegler certainly
was not collared. He sent down 45.3 overs, of which
nine were maidens, and wrecked six wickets for 105
runs —an average of 17.6. Excellent work for a Test
match! Schwarz was a bad second in bowling
honors. He sent down 32 overs, with not a maiden
among them, and bagged three wickets for 142 runs,
an average of 47.33. Sundries helped the Australian
score by 24, made up of Pegler’s one wide, 14 byes
and nine leg-byes.
The fourth round of League Rugbv in
Sydney finds the premier team (Eastern Suburbs)
still on top, with eight competition points to the
six held by South Sydney and Newtown. Glebe and
North Sydney have four each, and Annandale and
Balmain two. Western Suburbs has lost the whole
four games played. The star match of the day was
the bumping between Eastern Suburbs and Glebe,
which drew 22,000 people to Sydney Agricultural
Ground, and was expected to be a struggle grim and
great. It wasn’t. It was a battle of long-range
artillery, and the mighty hoof of Messenger kicked
Eastern Suburbs’ way to victory. The hoof of
Messenger is a great asset to Eastern Suburbs. In
this ease it won by 10 points to two, and not a
single try was registered by either side. The hoof
of Messenger did it all. Eastern Suburbs is now the
only League team that has been able to avoid even
one defeat. For the rest, Newtown downed Annan-
dale by seven to three; but the difference in the
points does not represent the difference in the play.
Annandale put up just as good a game as the other
team, but the luck inclined to Newtown. The really
horrible affair was that between South Sydney and
Balmain. South got the Ragged Suburb down, and
clawed it by 29 points to five. North Sydney also
made a fairly big splash, overthrowing Western
Suburbs by 21 to five.
In the Rugby Union division, University and
Western Suburbs are at the top of the pyramid with
eight points each. The others are far behind —New-
town, Glebe and North Sydney being the nearest
with five points apiece. It will be noticed that
where the League is weak or non-existent, the Union
clubs are strong. Eastern Suburbs, St. George and
Manly have only three each, and South Sydney and
Balmain have not yet broken their egg-shells. At
University Oval the Students gave St. George a
most unholy clawing, winning by 21 points to three;
which, under Union rules, is an alarming business.
Western Suburbs, the other undefeated Union team,
just managed to scrape through, beating South Syd-
ney by only three to nil. The surprise of the day
was Manly’s win, its first this season, over Glebe.
Heavens, how have the mighty fallen! The men
from the village by the sea flashed the butchers by
11 to three; and it is rumored that no man in
either team has been heard to speak since. Newtown
kicked 15 points out of Balmain, and the Tattered
Suburb only managed to kick three in return.
Eastern Suburbs won with comparative ease over
North Sydney, the scores being 11 to three.
In the Australian League division, the premier
team (East Sydney) again went under, being
stamped flat by Y.M.C.A. (66 to 43). Paddington
is now the only undefeated team on the list. On
Saturday Sydney tried to pull it down, but went
down itself by 59 points to 25. North Sydney
found the baby team from the Rail and Tramway
Department a tougher problem than it anticipated,
and just managed to struggle through by 29 to 11;
which is not an overwhelming defeat in the branch
of football which goes in for cricket scores. New-
town and South Sydney each scored 74 points, so,
presumably, it was a tie. The result of the upheaval is
to leave Paddington in its old place at the ton with
20 points, to give North Sydney the second rank
to itself with 16 points, and to throw Sydney
and Y.M.C.A. together in the third with 12 each.
Below that are only single figures.
The Soccer crowd has now no less than three
First Grade competitions-—the Rawson Cup, the
Association Cup and the Gardiner Cup. The first
round of the Gardiner Cup was played at Wollongong
between the Corrimal and Y.M.C.A. (Sydney) 0 teams.
The Svdney crowd was defeated bv four goals to
one. Six clubs struggled for the Rawson Cup, and
Sydnev downed a team from H.M.S. Drake by five
goals to two. Balmain beat Canterbury by four
goals to three, and Granville and Newtown drew
with three goals each. For the Association Cup six
teams also battled. West Svdney and Balmain drew
with one goal each, and Northern Suburbs downed
Glebe by one goal to nil. Newtown beat the Police
(which it used frequently to do at nights) by four
goals to two. So the tangle works out: For the
Rawson Cup Glebe is in the van with six competi-
tion points, and its nearest competitors are Balmain
and Svdney, with four each. Newtown has three,
Granville and Canterbury two each, and the Drake
one. The Association Cup shows a closer struggle,
for West Sydney and Balmain have each seven points.
Garden Island, Y.M.C.A. and Northern Suburbs have
each four. Newtown has two, and Glebe and Police
have so far not won a game.

N.S.W. Rugby League will put up the
shutters on the Premiership Competition next Satur-
day, the occasion being an inter-State scrap with
Bananaland. The Northern State has so far failed
to score in inter-State League Rugby, but the team
that is coming contains so much new blood that a
surprise is quite possible. Still, the Queensland
crowd is unfortunate, inasmuch as the N.S.W. team
will consist of the “Kangaroo” 13. And a Kangaroo
13 is a very, very tough proposition.
The League Council took down the sharp-
est and heaviest axe it could find on the premises,
and killed off a junior team which had pounded and
kicked a referee a couple of weeks before. The
whole 18 players who took part in the scrap have
been biffed out for “life” ; and quite a crowd of
others suspended for short periods. The council has
also announced that in future it will take even more
drastic action against any of its players who assault
an umpire. The League umpire is going to be like
the Roman citizen —and the bare announcement that
he is will protect him. In future umpire-baiters will
not only be tossed right out. but prosecuted to the
uttermost rigor of the law. The League Council has
done itself proud !
* * * *
Saturday’s Melbourne hoofball provided a
change in the existing trend of affairs, as Fatman
would say, in the shape of a copious downfall of
moisture throughout the afternoon. There was also
a change in the spirit of the dream of at least one
club, inasmuch as the mighty Essendon, meeting the
despised Geelongeese on its own East Melbourne
ground, went down wallop and spoilt the, symmetry
of its spotless record, in a manner of speaking. So
far nobody has been able to account for the disaster.
The weather conditions were adverse, but the ’Dons
were the lighter team, so should have had the ad-
vantage of the heavy going. Anyhow, before they
sized up the catastrophe that had struck them, the
seasiders had put up 26 points to their nine. Try
as they would they could never get quite level, and
were • three points in default when the bell rang
49 to Geelong’s 52. On the Metropolitan Cricket
Ground, Melbourne and Carlton indulged in a fierce
scrimmage up to half-time. Then the .Red Legs fol-
lowed ’Wood’s tactics of the previous week, kept the
game open and the ball all over the shop, and piled
on 25 points while the massive Carltonians, plung-
ing round in the mud, could only score two, and
didn’t make up the leeway. Scores—Melbourne, 50 ;
Carlton, 44. The winners’ goal-shooting was gaudy,
considering the conditions —eight goals two behinds
—but that was mainly the result of playing the ball
to the right man. ’Wood’s collision with Richmond
was a humorous episode for the first quarter, when
the scorer notified: ’W’ood, 34 points ; Richmond, nil.
After that it became wearisome, and few of the rain-
soaked spectators waited to see the end —’Wood, 72 ;
Richmond, 40. Richmond, thus early in the season,
has struck the internal trouble that spells disaster.
Many of its best players have left, and half of the
present 18 won’t speak to the other half, while
most of them are not on visiting terms with the
committee. St. Kilda put up a hefty struggle
against South, and at half-time had scored 33
points to South’s eight; but thereafter the Red-and-
Whites, seeing another thrashing impending, took
complete charge of the proceedings, piled on 42
points to the Saints’ two, and won handily by 50 to
35. It was a pleasing example of what South can
do when it has the mind. ’Varsity, possibly un-
nerved by the fact that one of its players had been
reported by a steward for “jobbing” an opponent,
and suspended for four weeks, made a poor show
against ’Roy, notching only 32 to the Maroons’ 59.
The mightiest Ass. struggle was between the rising
’Scray team and Brunswick—a strenuous, exciting
episode, ending in favor of the Brickies by one point
only—4s to ’Scray’s 44. P’ran achieved its first
victory this season by upending ’Town in the slush ;
but the feat was nothing to brag about, a more or
less lucky goal in the last quarter giving it the neces-
sary points—44 to ’Town’s 38. P’ran possesses a
fairly good team, but there seems to be something
wrong with it somewhere; possibly, being a shop-
keeping suburb, the advent of the winter sales has
upset its balance somewhat. Port and ’Cote in-
dulged in a genteel encounter, Port coming out on
top by 75 points to 45. The undefeated North
walloped Brighton by 70 to 45, and Essendon
handed Melbourne City its customary thrashing—77
to 25 being the measure thereof. One doesn’t like
to speak firmly to these novices as yet, but there
comes a stage at which forbearance ceases to be a
virtue, and that stage, for Melb. City, is not far off.
The fourth round of the Sydney lacrosse
gamble left Eastern Suburbs alone at the head of the
competition with eight points, and Petersham and
Sydney running close with six. Stanmore, Iroquois
and Mohicans have four each, and University, Bal-
main and Manly comprise the tail. Last week’s
moist weather made the ground heavy, and turned a
game designed for a hard-frozen surfaoe into heavy
labor. Petersham’s eight goals to Sydney’s four
was the widest gap of the day. Balmain smote
Manly by eight to five, while some o t M 'e M, e" 11 v'*
students so far recovered from the morning drunk as
to be able to go down to the Mohicans ... gu....
five. Eastern Suburbs received a forfeit from the
Iroquois owing to the latter’s “extensive casualty
list.” Which is not a good testimonial for any
brand of sport.
When not battling for Australia at lawn
tennis, Norman Brookes finds time to reap a bauble
at golf; and last week he raked in the Royal Mel-
bourne Club’s championship. His opponents were
W. J. Riddle and C. Petley, both men of tonnage
and tall fellows of their hands.

The fallacy that bowls is an old fogey’s
game struck trouble at Parramatta (N.S.W.) re-
cently, when 16 “grandfathers” tackled a similar
number of boys, to see who should pay for a leg-o’-
mutton supper. The grandads gathered the first rink
by 22 to 10, and then senile decay fell upon them,
and they went right under —74 to 53. The aggregate
ages of the ancients was 1050, while that of the boys
was just under half.
The Langford-Flynn fight in Melbourne
was not such a one-sided affair as most fight-fol-
lowers expected it woulV be. “Porky” held his own
better than anybody expected, and it was not till
after 14 rounds that Langford got the victory.
Flynn’s trouble was simply that he couldn’t hit
hard enough. He proved that he could take quite a
lot of punishment, and over and over again he
showed that, as a boxer, he is Langford’s superior.
Langford is not a boxer —he is a boring slugger.
And had the boxer opposed to him been able to hit
hard enough he would have won the fight. But he
couldn’t, and after 14 rounds of battery Flynn was
in a bad way, while the bounding negro was fresh
and strong as ever. As Flynn had absolutely no
hope, and to continue the fight meant a knock-out in
short order, the referee very wisely stopped the pro-
ceedings, and gave Langford the verdict. There s
only one way to beat Langford. No single blow that
anybody, except, perhaps, Barry could give, would
knock him out —and Barry can’t get that wallop
home. So the scheme is to do as McVea did before
he dropped his bundle —fasten on to the weakest spot
discoverable, and hammer at it all the. time. And
if the negro’s wallops can be avoided, it is only a
matter of time till that concentrated bashing will
break even the hardy Langford up. #
The Totalisator broke out again last week.
At Helena Vale (S.A.) Jolimont’s third place paid
£34 10s. on a 10s. investment. Tarsus Eva ran
second at Brisbane (Q- ), and paid investors £lO 6s.
At Rosehill, near Sydney, two nags which finished
second, were recorded by the bookmaker at any
price between 33 and 100 to one. But, needless to
say, Christian Abrahams never pays seconds. It s
awful to ask him to pay firsts, sometimes. #
Another highly-trained athlete cracks up
early. A. J. Rudd, just dead at Pinnaroo (S.A.),
was a Victorian who settled in Adelaide and made a
name at lacrosse. Goal-keeping was his strong
point, and he played for Australia against the
murderous Canadians when they were here. When
his' insurance do. was swallowed by a bigger one, he
went and died on the land: #
From London: —No less than four new
cricketing books are announced for early publication
here. “England v. Australia,” by P. F. Warner,
is described as an official history of the recent tour
of the Englishmen. J. B. Hobbs, a professional mem-
ber of the team, has an unofficial book appearing
under the auspices of Pitman and Sons. It will be
largely a reproduction of his letters from Australia
to the London Evening News. A. A. Lillev, Eng-
land’s wicket-keeper for many years, is bringing out
a volume of reminiscences, padded with practical ad-
vice to young cricketers. And C. B. Fry contributes
a volume on cricket to Nash’s “National Library of
Sport.”
W. J. Buzolich, a well-known Victorian
cricket enthusiast, is shifting his_ commercial cares
from Melbourne to Sydney. Buzolich, in conjunction
with the late James Thompson and others of the old
Vic. Cricket League, pegged away for years at the
Association, until at last a scheme of district cricket
tournaments was adopted. As an active combatant
in pennant matches,' Mr. Buzolich played with the
Essendon club. # #
It is of interest to learn that the well-known tyre
manufacturers, the Michelin Tyre Co., Ltd., have
established a very efficiently equipped touring office
at their London premises, 81 Fulham-road, Chelsea,
S.W. This is placed gratuitously at the disposal of
colonial motorists, irrespective of the make of tyre
they may use. Guide-books for all the principal
European countries, containing detailed itineraries,
have been carefully compiled, and may be had for the
asking. In addition to these there is a varied selec-
tion of guide literature provided for reference, and
large-scale road maps are always available for con-
sultation. Information can be obtained upon any
tour you propose, but Continental touring is a
speciality, and complete itineraries are mapped out
for any route desired; also, of course, free of charge.*
Two different sections of Labor in Maori-
land don’t love one another overmuch. This
is how the official mouthpiece of the Trades
Council’s faction refers to the opposition
camp h
No group of men at any time in the history of the
world have ever displayed more arrogance, more
bigotry, more intolerence, more dogmatism than the
small group of Anarchists who, registering them-
selves as the “Federation of Labor,” have set out to
bring Maoriland under their heels.
The opinion of the Federation concerning
the other viper is equally scalding.
H. F. Dickens, the foreman of the jury
that found the YVagga butcher a fraud and
not Sir Roger Tichborne, recently died, and
his will has been proved at £347,000. He
was not related to novelist Charles—was
merely a big draper of Regent-street, Lon-
don. He must be nearly the last of the
people prominently concerned with the
amazing trial. It is noteworthy that the
Walls of Derry and the Flames of Smith-
field had a share even in that squalid ro-
mance. Some of the people who hung most
desperately to A. Orton did so because of
his assurance that all the evidence against
him had been devised by the Jesuits.
By The Bulletin’s Most Illegible Lon-
don contributor: —
Came across a curious and little-known pamphlet
in the British Museum the other day, entitled, “Sir
Henry Parkes and Mr. Chamberlain, M.P.” The
writer, J. Bussell Endean, was a London shopkeeper,
and a sometime member of the London School Board.
He was angered at a laudatory reference to Parkes
by Chamberlain, when the latter, as Secretary of
State for the Colonies, introduced a Bill enabling
Australia to federate. Endean wrote to Chamberlain,
strongly objecting to “such a man as Parkes being
enrolled among the worthies of the Victorian age, and
presented to posterity as an example worthy of imi-
tation.” Then he went on to inform Chamberlain of
his unsatisfactory business relations with the bearded
old Sydneyite. Parkes, when last in London, went to
Endean and introduced himself as late Premier of
N.S.W. Among various articles he selected was a
handsome morocco album, which, he explained, was
to be filled with photographs of Australian buildings
and scenery, and presented to Gladstone. Endean
declares that “Gladstone would have rejected the gift
with sovereign contempt if he had known that the
album was not only not paid for, but was never
intended to be paid for.” Parkes wrote for his ac-
count ( £25 in all), but shipped himself out of
London without liquidating—which was so like
Hairy Henry. On the voyage he wrote that the ac-
count had been mislaid, and requested that a copy
should be sent to his Sydney address. The long and
the short of the pamphlet is that six years elapsed
before the money was dragged out of Parkes, and
then only under the threat of public exposure by let-
ters to the leading Australian papers. Endean sums
up Parkes as an “expert swindling cheat.” He al-
leges another case in which Parkes did a brother
tradesmen out of £5 Bs., and adds: “How many other
swindling acts he perpetrated in London I do not
attempt to say, but it is not likely that his pirate
proclivities were content with these two cases only.
The trading community of Sydney knew him too
well. His reputation in Australia will be remem-
bered. His reputation is too patent in Australia to
be redeemed by any laudation anyone may attempt
to give him in the House of Commons.”
WHY THEY MAFFICKED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For close upon two hours on Sunday night great
excitement prevailed at the Deutscher Verein, the
German Club in Phillip-street, where, from some
source or another, the belief gained confident cur-
rency that war had been declared between England
and Germany.- —Sydney Telegraph (28/5/’l2).
What caused the German Club to boil
With Anti-British hate?
Why was the dinner left to spoil?
Why did the members rate
Perfidious Albion, and proceed
To howl the “Wacht am Rhein,”
And brag about the “sauer-kraut breed”
’Midst “Hochs” ! yelled nine times nine?
What was the reason of the din?
Methinks the answer’s clear,
’Twas that which is the origin
Of all such rot—just Beer.

It is a mistake to expect any lasting benefit from the use
of ointments in the treatment of Piles. At the very best they
can do no more than give temporary relief, as they only moder-
ate the symptoms but do not expel the cause.
Andrew Murphy’s Pile Pills are Nature’s own remedy.
They not only give immediate relief, but also ensure, a speedy
and lasting cure in all cases. They remove all impurities from
the blood, tone up the general health, and make life worth the

“C. Ockney” : When “Kismet" was being played in
Dublin, a month or two ago, a weird claim was put
forward by the Irish author, Padraic Colum, who
wrote to the local Freeman’s Journal, suggesting
that there were certain curious resemblances between
Oscar Asehe’s money spinner and his (Colum’s)
“The Desert,” written in 1908. Padraic alleges cer-
tain “psychic phenomena” as responsible for these
similarities, and has formed, without consulting
Knoblanch, the author of “Kismet,” a committee to
inquire into the matter. Knoblanch meanwhile re-
mains calm and unafraid, one reason being that he
was hawking “Kismet” round for years prior to 1908.
“Carmine”: Enjoying a newspaper contribution by
Artist Ashton, on “Kismet,” I yet found a point to
cavil at, where he said that G. Gordon, as a scene-
painter, was in advance of anything else known in
Australia. Hennings, with a different genius, was
his equal. Gordon excelled all in landseape, but Hen-
nings was to the fore in the architectural line. Nor
would I say that W. Pitt was below Gordon. Pitt
came, in 1854, from being scenic artist to Mrs.
Vestris and Mathews at the Lyceum, which was ahead
of all London, except Beverley’s painting at Drury
Lane, for its scenery. Coppin brought Opie from
Tasmania to Melbourne in 1845, and he was a mighty
good artist. Next may be noted Hollies, and Iry,
who was scenic artist to the Melbourne Royal when
it opened, in 1855. Pitt had done a new Shaks-
pearian drop-curtain for Brooke’s opening at the
Qaeen’s. W. J. Wilson came from England in 1855,
and it is superfluous to expatiate on his long career.
Habbe the Dane, was later. Painstaking, but not
in the very first line. Hennings’s last important
works were “Antony and Cleopatra for Miln, and
“Theodora” for Bernhardt. Brunton was much in the
Hennings style. Goatclier and Coleman stand high
all the world over. Altogether, Australia has been
quite mighty in scenic artists.
The horrors of London after dark, according to a
Bilanderson notification :■ —
But when Big Ben, with solemn pealing,
Proclaims .its dreadful night has come,
Fighting, cursing, killing, stealing,
Swarms brass-browed shame —the city scum ;
Swells and women singing, talking,
Through the shadows a burglar creeps,
A soream of “Fire,” gaunt murder stalking ;
Vice rules supreme, when London sleeps.
The author’s name is not given, but Michael Joseph
is under a cloud ©f suspicion.
“Londoner” : Marie Wainwright, who played Desde-
mona to the Othello of the fierce and fiery Italian,
Salvini, has been giving some rem.mscences. In
the final act, where he professed to smother her, he
sometimes went near to actually doing it. He would,
she says, “jam the pillow over my face and make
breathing almost impossible.” Once, not content
with the ordinary business, he climbed into the bed
and knelt upon her chest, and, after the curtain fell,
he had the lofty Roman cheek to ask her why she
was so silent in her last moments. He was surprised
when she replied that one has to breathe before one
can speak, and that it is almost impossible to breathe
with an Italian leaping on your prostrate form In
the opinion of the Times dramatic critic (A. B.
Walkley) , Beerbohm Tree also overdoes this smother-
ing business. He has introduced what Walkley calls
a “ghastly innovation.” He has brought the bed-
stead (a magnificent piece of furniture) close to the
footlights, so that the murder is perpetrated within
full view of the audience, instead of the lady being
obliterated in the dim background of the stage, as has
hitherto been the case. And after he has ferociously
smothered Desdemcma, Tree intensifies the horror by
snatching her up, whirling her round, and then
furiously flinging her back among the bedclothes.
Possibly a time will come when the most realistic
Othello of all will drag his deceased wife round the
stage by the hair, and then cast her remains into the
orchestra.
Ada Crossley seems to be elbowing the massive and
majestic Clara Butt off her pedestal as “leading Eng-
lish contralto.” Both sang to a huge crowd of
60,000, in the Crystal Palace, on Good Friday. Lon-
don Telegraph gives first place to the Gippsland
girl, and says: “Madame Ada Crossley’s singing was
particularly appealing. For sheer beauty of tone
and depth of feeling her version of ‘Fac ut portend
in the Stabat Mater was on a higher level than any
that was reached in the rest of the concert.” Clara
Butt was only casually mentioned at the end of the
■notice.
“H.C.R.”: Re “Parisine” and the Fall of Robes-
pierre (B. 2/5/’l2). It is surmising to hear that the
drama “Robespierre” failed in Paris because the Re-
publicans were annoyed at the lack of respect shown
to the memory of thei,r hero. Robespierre was never
the idol of the French people, except, perhaps, for a
few months when a member of the Committee of
Public Safety. Search the public places and streets
of Paris to-day and you will find no monument or
memorial of that indefinable being. The real hero
of the Revolution is Danton. A splendid monument,
erected by the Municipality of Paris in 1889, stands
in the Boulevarde St. Germain, near the Luxemburg
Palace, on the site of the house in which he lived
when arrasted. Camille Desmoulins lodged in the
same dwelling, a flat above that occupied by Danton
and hm wi f e. /"other monument can be seen at ins
birthplace—Arris sur Aube. Inscribed on the former
monument are the eoncluding words of his most
famous speech: “Pour vafncre les ennemis de la
patrie il nous fait l'audace, l'audace, et toujours
l’audace.” Then there is the Rue Danton in the Quar-
tier Latin. According to Hilaire Belloc —surely &
supreme authority—it was a colleague of Danton’s
(Gamier of the Aube) —I write from memory of the
name, as I have not the book (“Danton,” by Belloc)
from which 1 quote—who called out across the floor i
of the Convention to Robespierre: “The blood of
Danton chokes you.” Anyhow, the scene in the Con-
vention, probably the most graphic of our historical
records, should be well worth seeing, and I much re-
gret it is not likely to reach the far country town
from which I write. Thanks to “Parisine” for the
paragraph, I had often heard of Sardou’s “Robes-
pierre,” but had no idea that it was a failure in
Paris. Surely the reason advanced by your corre-
spondent cannot be the correct one.
“Hullo” : A remarkable play, “The Terrible Meek,"
recently produced at The Little Theatre, New York,
is a shocker. Its author is Charles Rann Kennedy,
author of “The Servant in the House,” a play in
which Christ figures to much more dramatic effect
than He does in Jerome’s “The Passing of the Third
Floor Back.” “The Terrible Meek” is a one-act
play, acted in partial or total darkness till its aston-
ishingly effective climax. There are only three char-
acters —a woman, a soldier and a captain—all, from
their speech, modern Londoners. The curtain rises
on utter darkness. The wailing of the woman is
heard, and then the captain and the soldier begin to
talk. They wonder what the executed man had done
to warrant his fate. The soldier only knows that
“some log-faced old jossers” hadn’t liked what lie
had said, and had kept after him till the magis-
trate had found him guilt.v. But everybody con-
cerned, they decide, had merely done his duty. A
ray' of light pierces the darkness, and the woman's
face is seen. She tells how she had borne him and
brought him up; and now lie’s dead ; “hung up in
the air like a slaughtered beast." The captain asks
the mother to forgive him for his part in the tragedy,
and tells her that “the earth is her son’s. The meek,
the terrible meek, the fierce, agonising meek are
about to enter upon their inheritance.” All this in
the dark, with the audience getting more and more
sensitive. Then a sudden blaze of light shocks the
people dumb. For they see three gibbeted figures,
stark against an expansive blue, with the mother
bowed and weeping at the foot of the cross. The
three modern characters had all the time been dis-
cussing the Crucifixion.
Henry Trotter, whose songs sold by the million,
has just passed off in London at 57. For professional
purposes he Frenchified his name into Henri Trotcre.
His best known song, “In Old Madrid,” had an enor-
mous vogue, and it was almost equalled in popularity
by “Asthore.” ' Among his other ditties were “The
Deathless Army,” “My Old Shako,” “Within Your
Heart” and “Sweet Content.” A. tune would come
into Trotter’s head, and then lie would hunt up a
poet to fit it with words. Judging by results he was
a poor hunter.
“Rosna” : Singer Kate Rooney awakened one morn-
ing during the recent Dickens centenary scrimmage
to find her house famous. The contralto and her hus-
band own Ailsa Villa, a charming place at St. Mar-
garet’s on Thames. It turns out that Dickens in-
habited the place for years. He wrote “Nicholas
Nickleby,” entertained Thackeray and did various
other thrilling and noteworthy things there. There
are lots of celebrities in the neighborhood ;
amongst others, Marconi, M. E. Braddon, ex-Queen
Amelie, and Manoel, Portugal’s swiftest son.
THE SUPER STAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A royal betrothal is promulgated with the dead
body of a young Anarchist lying in the apartment in
which the ceremony takes place. In addition to the
incongruity which the presence of the corpse engen-
ders in the action of the play, it also seriously ham-
pers the actors in their work.
—Extract from recent critique.
When managers are blind to Art,
No wonder they disgust me!
They said I couldn’t play a part;
With one they’d never trust me.
The actor-chaps took up their oue;
They sneered at my ambitions;
Jealous of me they were, I knew—
Nervous for their positions !
I got, in spite of all, one day,
The chance for which I'd waited.
A corpse it was I had to play—
An Anarchist, ill-fated,
Whose bomb had burst too soon—poor dear!
The Hero moaned about him ',
And then produced the corpse for fear
The audience should doubt him.
I loved that part! On to the scene —
Dead centre —I was brought in,
And lying there, calm and serene,
The limelight I was caught in.
I was the blooming star —in fact
The mummers all I’d hocussed —-
No matter how they tried to act,
On me all eyes were focussed !
I heard them curse me ’neath their breath —
I’d “spoilt the show” —they swore it —
But lying cold and still in death,
I simply grinned and bore it!
I was in ev’rybody’s way—
Not one had room to act in,
And all the notices next day
The whole crowd was attacked in !
Mine was the part that scored —my word !
’ They said the play was shoddy,
But ev’rywhere you went you heard
Praise for the blessed “body.”
That’s how I starred —with naught to say !
And now, to my detractors
Say I: “Give me a corpse to play,
And I’ll corpse all the actors!”

EAT AND BE
STRONG
To be well and strong you must eat food, and having
eaten it, you must digest it and so turn it into the material
of your own body. You cannot be well if your body is not
properly nourished, and it cannot be nourished if your food
does not digest perfectly. Indigestion (imperfect digestion)
will make you weak and ailing, subject to headaches,
stomach pains—very likely constipation, and certainly
discomfort after eating. Matters do not end there, for the
poisons, formed in your stomach from the stagnant mass of
food, will be drawn into your blood and carried to every
part of your body, thus weakening your system and
rendering you liable to more deadly diseases. Don’t hesitate.
Take Mother Seigel’s Syrup. It so strengthens the stomach
and liver that indigestion becomes impossible, and it
cleanses your system of all impurities.
STRENGTH COMES FROM FOOD
BUT IT MUST BE WELL DIGESTED
"My life was a misery. Everything I ate caused nv' r "ore or less pain
and trouble. 1 also had pains in the che3t, together u ith a sense of
great weight and oppression, as well as heartburn, wind, and other
distressing symptoms.
“ 1 tried all sorts of medicines, but with no good results. After a few
days’use of Mother Seigel’s Syrup 1 began to feel better. What I ate
began to nourish me instead of causing pain and distress. Six bottles
banished every trace of Indigestion, so that I have not suffered since.

Bilbax: To take the first of your state-
ments about Tom Mann as a sample, you say: “In
Victoria he organised the Political Labor Party.”
The first Vic. Labor member was elected in 1859.
Then there was a gap. There were two Labor mem-
bers in the Parliament of 1889. John Hancock was
added in April, 1891, and two months later the
Political Labor party was organised. At the 1892
election 10 Laborites were returned. In 1894, the
party numbered 16. The movement was in full
blast before Mann was heard of here. And
you have the front to say that he made
a success of “the late Sydney wharf laborers’
strike.” As it happens, he was in England
then. The rest of your story is about equally unre-
liable. ... Ivan M. L.: The condensed story of a lady
with a prohibition order is declined. Please note
that when the Maoriland court issues a notice that
Maud Ethel Muriel Courtenay Cavendish, of 10
Bilker’s Alley, is no longer to be served with gin, it
doesn’t give the lady the document to take care
of.... Downy Bird: Your statement that the animal
“11.J.E.” described doesn’t look in the least like
his description, and has different habits, and hangs
out in a different place, makes us suspect that you
are thinking of a different animal. If one man
describes a desperate struggle with a large cod on
the Queensland coast, and another man says he is a
liar, because the creature mostly lives up a tree, and
is only found in Africa, that is the same sort of
discrepancy W. R. Reynolds: You fill two pages
with the news that the joke attached to that picture
is a chestnut, but in your haste and flurry and whirl
of asterisks, you forget to mention where it for-
merly appeared Kane Maker: The State Statisti-
cian lumps together “baskets, wickerware, matting,
etc.” According to the latest returns we have re-
ceived, the whole three industries and the “etc.”
employ 98 people in Sydney, and none in any other
part of the State. It seems a humble sort of job. .. .
Pierre: Too horrible. Also impossible. .. .Tura:
Carefully note your statement that you have fre-
quently met in the bush an animal half-cat and half-
rabbit. Presume you will call it the crabbit, just
as the son of the camel and the leopard is the
cameleopard, and the descendant of the eland and the
sycophant is the elephant. Send along any further
details about the bunnykitten that may come your
way. It must be interesting.... Cheri: A smashing
penalty for contempt is one of the things we would
score as a result of publishing your assault on the
C.S.R. Co S. E. Nightingale: A typical music-
hall poem. It may sound harsh, but this is one
of our truthful days Taranaki: Well, what did
the land cost? You say there is nothing in the
way of soil to be obtained in the district under
£25 an acre for cow worship, yet, according to the
evidence in the case you mention, 8000 acres were
bought at 12s. 6d. an acre quite recently The
Traveller: The argument in favor of only one class
on the railways, just as on the tramways, is enjoy-
ing a well-earned holiday. .. .Cog: What an earnest,
humorless person you are in regard to Soldene. . ..
P.S.: (1) Don’t know, (2) can’t read it anyhow....
H.G.: “If the Tom Manns of the world were de-
stroyed, what would take their place?” Does any-
one want anything to take their place ?. . . . Victim:
You make a lot of very serious charges, and give no
name or address. Presumably you expect us to pub-
lish the yarn and shoulder a dozen expensive libel
actions without even knowing where to find you when
you are wanted as a witness. .. .F. 0.: Brown’s moon-
lit lady basketed with some regret. If her literary
hair had been done with more skill we might have
presented her with a print dress. .. .E.R.: Gracefully
done, but it’s the sort of weak-backed, unoriginal
verse that needs to be propped up in a poet’s corner.
._. ..M.8.5.: Tell your boy that the ink is not yet
ripe. .. .G.H.: “The Heifer in the Team” is a slow,
creaky poem, but we will watch it while it does two
verses:—
Necessity once compelled a man to yoke a heifer
With a steer
She wild rebelled against his plan, but many
blows engendered fear
Till at last without a word being spoke
She pulled fair share nigh equal yoke for five
months of the year.
’Twas her owner’s trade with loaded dray his
team to drive the country round
And all open land through which there lay
His lone bush rounds no fence to bound
Or check or block his wandering stock
Where once unyoked would his efforts mock
To find where oft for days not found.
And hereabouts the dray stops, having strayed into
thick scrub.... Mick C. (V.): You have written on
both sides of the paper. And you are the sort of
person who shouldn’t write on either... .E.W.: It is
a rather raw medical poem, which needs to be ampu-
tated at the waist for a start.. . . J.A.: Guess it is the
first attempt you ever made to canter in verse....
V.H.H.: Heave away
THE MAN OF THE SEA.
See a noble ship standing there by the Quay
A great floating palace already for sea,
As we stand, we’re lost in admiration
To think such a vessel belongs to our nation,
And as the shades of evening are falling
We listen and hear the pilots calling
We hear the sound of the bells being rung
And that great floating palace from her moorings
is swung
Why, who’s that singing so hearty and free?
I know, lads, ’tis the man of the sea.
The other six jolly verses, commencing “Come
now, lads, and join in a song” and “One glass more,
lads, and then we’ll be right,” are reluctantly jet-
tisoned owing to want of space. .. .Percy M.: Sort of
bright, green yarn which usually ends up, “Written
by Percival M., age 16.” You write like 16—or 116.
... .M.H.W.: No name —no address. Just “M.H.W.”
As it is attached -to the most desolate and broken-
toothed Titanic poem yet received, we will translate
your three-letter brand to mean “Member of the
Howling Weepers.” Warn the rest of the pack to
keen off. .. .A.A.A.: Your initials suggest the sounds
emitted by a desperate fat man when pursuing a dis-
appearing ’bus. That is exactly what has happened.
.... Unemployed King: Best poem yet contributed to
this paper by a crowned head. Still it won’t pass. The
standard of royal verse seems to be very poor
D.E.D.: “Three Women” quite unsensational. Care-
ful work rather dull no surprises basket.
D.E.A.D. in fact. . . .W. S. Brownjohn: You seem
quite angry, Brownjohn. And why don’t you append
your address, Brownjohn ?,... G.A.W.: “0.K.” in
his par. (B. 9/5/’l2) cast no reflections on the methods
of Wirth Bros., and he did not suggest that Wirths’
Park, Melbourne, was other than a vast improvement
on the same place six years ago, when the Prince’s
Court syndicate held it. All he claimed was that
Wirths’"Park, well-conducted though it is, offers an
ideal site for an experiment in State ownership of
land ; and in that view this paper is with him
Braithwaite: “The Schicker’s Dirge” drew a tear
from every eye in the office.... Dri: The manuscript
is to hand, but the jokes are missing Slow Ahead:
Don’t go much on the searchlight idea Old
Reader: In 1899 the British Government grew
tired of the fluctuations of the Indian rupee,
and, rising ’ with a club in its hand, it fixed
the value of that wandering coin at Is. 4d. —
fifteen rupees to the £. It was told at the time
that it was playing the devil with the law of supply
and demand, but the scheme has worked well enough.
....Yalgun: The nigger said his aunt was a black
tracker. ° If that’s where we laugh, permit us to say
we will see you fried first. .. .James Murner: James,
if we told you what we really think of it you’d be
struck dumb.

‘Semelle’ Non-Skid.
Two things this cover reduces to a
minimum:—the possibility of side-slip and
the amount of wear.
It does not, like many so-called non-
skids made wholly of rubber, wear down into
an ordinary smooth tread, to begin skidding with

ject well above the tread, with their bases deeply
embedded in the rubber, ensure a firm hold on
the greasiest surface.
The band of stout chrome leather renders
the tread practically immune from punctures,
and extends up the walls far enough to
provide amply for their protection.
It is effective in every way and

“Van’': You can’t boat our sex for attention
to the small details of a business matter.
Two or three months a widow whom
Misfortune has been trying for years past
to crowd into the gutter was in an Eliza-
beth-street tram. Luck seemed to have
turned her way at last, and she was passing
through Sydney to a good billet in Banana-
land. The conductor told her to get out the
other side, please—and the next thing she
knew clearly was that she was in the hos-
pital. The Good Samaritan, who had been
in the car, went with her, and said that it
was all the tram’s fault, and if a witness
were needed presently she, the Good Samari-
tan, would be glad to be It. Then the Good
Samaritan went about her business or her
pleasure, and the mangled widow went on
being a hospital patient (she is still one, by
the way), and the mangled widow no more
knows who the Samaritan was than she
does the real state of the Turko-Italian
unpleasantness. There ought to be a law
compelling Good Samaritans to have their
names and addresses printed on their collars,
haloes or other furnishings.
The news that the China will be with-
drawn by the I\ and O. people from the
Australian service, after this trip, awakens
old memories. A whole sheaf of reputa-
tions went on the rocks when the big ship
hit the earth in the vicinity of the Straits
of Bab-el-Mandeb a decade ago. Rightly or
wrongly, a birthday party given by the Hon.
Mrs. I reeman-Thomas (wife of the Bras-
sey’s aide) was alleged to be primarily re-
sponsible for the disaster. Mariners who
should have been peering over the side in-
quest of reefs were said to be doing nothing
more useful than imbibing that which bites
like the gadder—that is the adder. When
the great bump transpired, and a sharp,
jagged fragment of Africa appeared in the
middle of the dining-saloon, a most un-
sightly panic set in, and it was here that
the above-mentioned reputations started fall-
ing to pieces. The ruined liner stayed for
many months where the careless folk in
charge had piled it up, and during all that
time it was a byword to the passing shipping
and a discreditable monument to the P. and
O. Co. So it was salvaged at vast ex-
pense, and repaired and set going again ; not
that it was good economy to do so, but on
something the same principle that a man
doesn’t care to have the remnants of a.
motor-car that he has smashed up lying
about his front gate.
Hr. Hoyle, of N.S.W., one of the new
Beeby-Holman-McGowen M’s.L.O., is from
Newcastle. The mystery of his nomination
is set at rest by the discovery that he was
the local leader years ago of the famous
Prudent Federation Party, ivhich held that
Australia was a foreign enemy bent on de-
vouring poor old Ma State root and branch.
Eminent members of the Party were
Hughes, Pilcher, K.C., Holman, A. Nugent
Robertson and the Sydney Telegraph.
The S. M. Heraldi, then under the tem-
porary direction of Gullett, made the only
big fight of its life on that occasion, and
was on the national side for tfie first and
last time. The memory of the palmy days
of the Prudentialists was apparently suffi-
cient to drag the Newcastle doctor from his
obscurity and land him in the Upper House.
Melbourne’s art culture is radiating from
a nrm of wholesale chemists and druggists.
Ihe late Felton’s bequest to the local Art
Gallery will eventually make it the Mecca
ot students and connoisseurs in the Com-
monwealth. and the late Grimwade is to he
represented at St. Paul’s Cathedral (Melb.)
hj an altar screen of carved Tasmanian
blackwood, with a central arch and decora-
tions from ancient models. Sculptor James
\N lute has the £ISOO. job in hand.
Poor old General Booth, in defiance of his
doctors, went on Good Friday to the London
Congress Hall and spoke to a big crowd that
he could not inspect. Said he: “My imper-
fect vision prevents me from reading; what
I write I cannot read ; and I cannot see the
countenance of a single individual here.”
He incidentally remarked: “Whatever you
will do without me when I pass away from
lieie Ido not know. Other people have
also wondered. General belief is that the
Sal. Army will burst up and perish.
“E. P. Cure”: A cry of indignation has
split the atmosphere in Melbourne since the
announcement of the Hotelkeepers’ Ass.
that the counter-luncli would probably be
oft before long. The free food is a heavv
charge. One publican recentlv stated that
the cost in his case amounted to £l5OO a
year. Australia is the only place, or one of
the very few places, where food is dis-
pensed gratis. In London the counter-
lunch has to be paid for. In every hotel
stale sardines, old cake, ancient hard-boiled
eggs and dusty sandwiches are on sale at
tuppence a plate. But in Australia a man
can buy a pint of beer for threepence and
tall heavily upon a gallon of wholesome food
to nil in the crevices.
Thus “10-2-4” :
• the rj ’^ a ’ lic catastrophe, my only wonder
is that there wasn t sufficient panic aboard to stagger
w •° r centuries -. The capacity of some pebple
r° r bceoming pame-smitten is amazing. F’rinstance
1 ° ffere(1 > th e other night, to drive a friend and his
wife down a quiet, level, broad and well-lighted'
™i eet J n ~ l lotor- c ar - They stood on the kerb in a
palpably broken state, waiting for the devastation to
begin. As I advanced on the machine they seemed
to be taking a farewell of one another, and of all
that is fair and charming in life. They did not
speak—tor the same reason, doubtless, that the con-
demned are not usually chatty in the vicinity of the
gallows. they stepped into the vehicle as though
it had been a tumbril. I started the engine, climbed
into my* seat, and prepared for action. And now a
<kil rai i!!% e happened. The engine, owing to the
throttle on the steering-wheel being insufficiently ad-
vanced, emitted a faint sigh, like unto the suspira-
tion of some sleeping infant, and stopped. To mv
surprise a bass roar or howl of dismay instantly tore
the atmosphere apart, over against lhy back' hair
likewise a piercing female scream. Out of the corner
of one astounded eye I saw a male form hurl itself
frantically over the side* of the car. Arrived on thte
ground, the owner of the form fell upon the door
which separated him* from his- wife. The handle
came off with a curse, but the door stayed shut
(The ear during all this uproar remained as dead ami
silent and passively inoffensive as a ruined tomb.)
To bound’ from the gutter, gallop round to the unin-
jured d'oor, tear it open and rescue the lady, was to
the husband a matter of seconds. When my’head had
stopped.swimming I pulled myself together, and went,
in search of them. T did not find them, nor have I
found them since, though I understand that the J. C, !
Williamson firm, one of whose directors witnessed
the’ occurrence, is, prepared to pay uif well to incor-
porate the act in the current pantomime. Imagine the
plight of a ship’s captain, with his vessel in trouble
and a couple of hundred nervy characters like the
above aboard. It would be grim, indeed.

IN BANANALAND
The just completed Assembly elections
were conspicuous for two things—the num-
ber of close shaves and the number of awful
blunders. The initialling and numbering of
ballot papers were problems clean beyond
the intellectual returning officers, hence de-
lay and worry, and, in two cases, probably
appeals to the Elections Tribunal. Why
doesn’t Home Secretary Appel make these
geniuses pass a simple qualifying exam.?
The completion of the Port Alma line will
bring grief to certain quarters of Rockhamp-
ton. A big lightering trade up and down
the Fitzroy has flourished for years, but it
was stipulated in the agreement made by
the Kidston Government that all goods for
Rockhampton should be carried via Port
Alma when the railway was completed.
Lighters should now, therefore, be purchas-
able at two a penny.
N.S.W. Premier McGowen is not the
onlv member of the Labor party who is
not prepared to rush the nationalisa- ‘
tion of hospitals. In 1906, the Kid-
ston Government introduced a Bill to
compel Brisbane to‘support its embarrassed
infirmary by the imposition of a land-tax.
To the surprise of everyone, David Bowman
voted with the Tory crowd against this mea-
sure, though nationalisation of hospitals has
always been a plank of the Labor platform
in Queensland.
The final recount at Port Curtis (Q.),
which finished the election squabble (barring
possible appeals), was an interesting event.
A.s belated postal votes wandered in the re-
sults bobbed back and forward. Some dmes
one man was about a vo.te ahead, and at
other times the same man was a vote or half
a vote behind. Then there was a dead heat.
Then there was a recount. Finally, the old
Labor member gets back by two votes —
1590 against 1588. Partly through bad
wicket-keeping, our old friend Sundries
(called “Informal” in this case) scored 39.
Denham has now 47 supporters in the As-
sembly, and Bowman 25.
“Politicus’s” warning:—
How serious is the eye trouble in Western Queens-
land may be judged from a recent report of Dr.
Eleanor Bourne, who was appointed by the Govern-
ment to inspect the vision of Western children. One-
half of the children examined had had an attack of
eye disease, and in 30 per cent, of the cases defective
vision had resulted. In 18 per cent, of the children
examined, so serious was the impairment of sight
that intellectual progress was materially hindered.
But here is the most alarming remark in the report:
“Probably 11.3 per cent, of the Western boys will
be unable to handle a rifle efficiently when they grow
up.’’ If this be so, and present writer (who has
seen a great deal of Western school children) be-
lieves it to be absolutely true, the sooner the Aus-
tralian States, in the interests of defence, provide
the backblocks kiddies with the cheapest possible
medical attendance for the eyes, together with suit-
able salves and glasses, the better for us all. The
townsman is mostly too soft to be a really good
soldier, and if the Westerner, who is usually all
greenhide and whipcord, is disqualified by his de-
fective vision, then the defence of this country is
likely to drift into a parlous predicament. The
“ability to shoot” must be every nation’s first line
of defence nowadays, and the ability to see must
necessarily be the first qualification of every efficient
rifleman.
Free Food.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Freetrade means Free Food. —Current British sup-
position.
O striving multitude!
Why do ye sadly brood?
Have ye not got a joyful lot—
Freetrade, Free Food ?
O striking multitude!
Why then this bitter mood?
Do ye not know how blessings flow —
Freetrade, Free Food ?
Rebellious multitude—
Rail not in fashion rude ;
Your ports are full of com and wool,
And, lo ! —Free Food !
Slum-wizened multitude
Drop now your ravings crude ;
On ev’ry sea your vessels be—•
Freetrade, Free Food!
And, starving multitude,
Rise up, with strength renewed,
And praise the Lord who spreads the
board
With food —Free Food !
Let no unholy thought
Of discontent intrude,
But still your pain with this refrain—
Freetrade, Free Food !
QUEENSLAND.
F.B.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 25, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Governor Macgregor has been bogging in
at Sapphiretown in the search for hidden
wealth, and a few days ago had sundry loads
of wash-dirt treated at one of the local
plants. No rush has yet set in for the
vicinity. His Ex. is due to leave the field
on Monday, and on Tuesday he will try his
luck at Rockhampton.
Another Parliamentary wedding has oc-
curred, the participants in this ease being
Bernard Corser, the new member for Bur-
nett, and Miss Glissan, whose mamma, by
her second venture into matrimony, is Mrs.
Hamilton Kelly. Kosciusko is the present
abiding place of those who were two but are
now one.
A NECESSARY INGREDIENT.
DROVER: “Can't you cook anything but meat and damper? How about some blanc-mange?”
NEW COOK: "Bloo monge, Boss ? Why, there ain't a bit o' fat in the (amp.”
Mrs. Barnes, wife of the Minister, has
been very ill, and, though slowly recovei.ng,
is not yet sufficiently well to greet the many
friends who hover at the front door for news
of the invalid.
On Wednesday, Mrs. Barlow entertained
about 20 of the younger set at a novel tea,
which was spread within the • seclusion of
Wanstead. A guessing competition was
won by Miss Winnie Denham, whose father
is Premier of this State. Luck seems to run
in the family. The old man guessed that he
would win the election, and he did.
Last Saturday a very quiet little wedding
happened at St. John’s Cathedral, when
Harry Cupples, manager of the London
Bank of Australia, married little Miss
Muriel Horton, the youngest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. N. Horton, of Eagre -i unc-
tion. The bridegroom hails from Maori-
land, and he has conveyed his lady away to
show her how the moon shines thereabouts,
it being notorious that until you see the
moon they have in Auckland you don’t know
what a moon really is.
Another spasmodic attempt is being made
to rope in Souls and brand them W.C.T.U.
Delegates to the mustering were met to-day
by Mayor and Mayoress Raymond, who fed
them in the Museum Gardens. The soul-
drive commences on Monday.
A series of teas, in honor of pretty and
popular Doris Cohen, who weds one Cowan
very soon, has entered upon the 120th edi-
tion or thereabouts. On Wednesday the
Qualtrough sisters were the scone publishers,
and to-day Miss McNab issued free copies of
Hot Tea to women only. More to follow.
On Thursday Miss Alice Missing and her
sister. Mrs. Huby King, of Mackay, enter-
tained a number of their friends at Eschen-
hagen’s. Mrs. Pennefather hostessed an-
other party downstairs on the same after-
noon. Owing to a slump in that essential
creature, Sarahmaryann, it is the fashion
to eat in public nowadays, and the caf6
keepers cordially approve.
On Wednesday a. merry dance was got
under weigh at the Yeronga Hall in order to
raise some money to pay off the ravening
debt on the building. The ruse was suc-
cessful, and everybody had a good time, in-
cluding the creditors. The debt, in fact,
was surprised by a flank movement, and
routed with great slaughter. When last
heard of it was fleeing in disorder.
The various needlework guilds on Tues-
day gathered at Mrs. Frank Corrie’s, and
with just pride spread out the mass of gar-
ments they have made during the year. In
between notes of admiration, notes of music
were bandied round, and tea and cakes
added their fragrance to the joyous occasion.
Same day the Presbyterian Women’s Mis-
sionary Union entertained Mrs. Hey and her
husband. He is a reverend from Mapoon, a
place where black brother is taught the
Scriptures, and black sister is, on occasion,
admonished on her bare shoulders with some-
thing flexible. James Allan, M.L.A., lent
his grounds, and the Anti-Sinners’ Union
was present in force. Lady Macgregor was
amongst them, but, alas, the Chiel was miss-
ing. In this regard I dare not set down
my feelings, Thargomindah.
Last Saturday afternoon Noel Elliott, a
fine lad of 23, met with an accident on the
football field, and died in the hospital a few
hours later. He was a son of Gilbert Elliott
of the Harbors and Rivers Department, and
a specimen of the right kind of young Aus-
tralian. In token of regret and respect no
Rugby Union matches took place to-day,
and the University ball has been cancelled.
The lawn during the race meeting both
yesterday and to-day was uncomfortably
crowded. Miss Celia Cooper, Mrs. and Miss
Real, Mrs. Barlow, and a host of country
visitors were present on both days, and the
envious, rags were all that could be desired.
One Brisbane dressmaker, at least, has sown
trouble. One of our richest daughters, who
had hied her racewards, feeling secure in a
new and well-fitting gown, experienced the
agony of meeting a twin garment, draped on
the shapely form of a country cousin. Color,
style and trimming were in entii ' sympathy
with the scowl of deliberate animosity which
the two irate females exchanged.
Next Saturday the great tennis event, the
Metropolitan Championship, will be played.
The bauble hanging to it is a new Courier
Cup, St. John having won tl.o other last
year. This time it is expected that his old
opponent, Turner, will make the pace so hot
that St. John will wish he had taken to
work as a hobby.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Queensland got a political Constitution im
1559, and three years later —just 50 years
ago—Mr. Henry, owner of a Far Northern;
station, imported three donkeys, male,»fe-
male and gelding. It has never been neces-
sary to import any since then.
Bananaland has achieved another record::
in the four weeks ended May 18 it built 31A
miles of new railway, including something
over nine miles in one week. For some'
mysterious reason Cohen is expected to be-
tremendously pleased when he hears it. The-
chances, however, are that Cohen will turn-,
up the records and find that, even before'
this railway-building mania started, every
142 people in the State had to hump the'
weight of one mile of line; and Cohen may
then begin to wonder how long the backs;
will be before they crack with the extra
weight.
The S.A. Educational Commission was
so impressed with Queensland’s itinerant
teacher system that it is recommending its
adoption in Crow-eater Land. One of
Queensland’s travelling instructors, who has
to cover a district of 25,000 square miles,
narrates how he encountered one man wh6
had won £BOO in a Tattersall’s sweep. This
lucky wight could only count up to 200 —
didn’t know there were numbers beyond
that. He offered the teacher £5O to teach
him to read and write. It is, however, very
rare to find an Australian-born backblocks
man who can neither read nor write. This
specimen was imported.
The Commonwealth’s Sugar Commission
happens just 50 years after the first sugar
was made in Australia. An old Courier
reports the experiment. Director Hill, of
the Botanic Gardens, had some cane growing,
and he supplied a quantity to John Buhot,
who had been in Barbadoes. The canes
were “green and imperfect,” but Buhot
chopped them up, boiled them in three small
iron pots hung in the open, and got a suc-
cessful granulation.

Suits Abstainers and
Non-Abstainers
O.T. is derived from fruits and herbs having nutritive and
beneficial properties. Agreeable to the palate and distinguished for
favorable effects on the constitution, it is a drink that can be taken
in any quantity with the feeling that it is conducive to perfect
health.
It blends perfectly with all other drinks —moderating the
intoxicating effects of alcoholic liquors, the “flatulent” effects of
aerated drinks, and acting as a corrective for drinking water. O.T.
is a beverage that appeals to all conditions of men, women and
children in all countries.
Good for Colds 8 Influenza
The stimulating effect of O.T. improves the circulation and pro-
motes the warmth in the body necessary to ward off colds, chills and
influenza. Taken in time, it will counteract the effects of a chill
and drive out a cold that may be coming on. It is invaluable to all
engaged outdoors.
A Substitute for Alcohol
O.T. has “life” and “bite” like spirits, and is the nearest
substitute for alcohol ever produced. After alcoholic excess it
restores vitality, appetite and nerve, while satisfying the craving for
alcoholic stimulants. It is a splendid “pick-me-up,” and has a tonic
effect if you rise with a bad taste in the mouth or a disordered liver.
Most Beneficial for Ladies
O.T. has some similar properties to Gin, and is most beneficial
for ladies when needing a stimulant. If all ladies really knew the
merits of O.T. no home would be without it.
Relieves Indigestion, Colic
etc.
O.T. is a true digestive, and is the only after-dinner liqueur in
the world without alcohol. Tt ensures complete digestion, and pre-
vents indigestion, flatulence, and “full feeling” after meals.
The warm flavor of O.Tis derived
from certain fruits, highly
esteemed in Tropical countries for
safeguarding health .
O.T. is an excellent Stomachic, and a valuable aid for Colic
and other Stomach Troubles.

The new Edison “Opera” Phono-
graph has proved an instantaneous
success.
It is a magnificent machine —a
machine with Amberola features yet
not costing as much. Equipment in-
cludes a handsome Mahogany Cabinet,
Maroon finish body, and Mahogany
Music Master Cygnet Horn. A Crane
Support is unnecessary, as the Horn
is pivoted in a rigid Arm Casting,
allowing it to swing in any direction
desired.
The Edison dealer nearest you will
gladly demonstrate and explain the
merits of this new model to you on
reauest. If you do not know the
address of a dealer, write us direct,
and we will tell you, and also send
latest lists of Phonographs and Re-
cords.

Ingersoll—the watch with
the Quality in the right place
Do not buy a watch for its pretty case. It is the move-
ment or works that make it keep time. Seven-eighths of the
cost of every Ingersoll goes into the works to ensure quality
of material and workmanship.
In the cheap showy class, the cost is put into the case,
and little or no consideration is given to the accuracy of the
mechanism.
The only way to make sure that you get an accurate,
reliable cheap watch is to see that the name Ingersoll is
on the dial of the watch you buy.

ment, and the quality of the

accompanies each watch.

Made Sleep Impossible: Tried Cuti-
cura Ointment and in Incredibly
SHortTime Cure Was Complete.
About twelve months ago while residing
at Newry, Gippsland, I was very much
troubled with my feet. They were highly
inflamed and on raising the foot off the
ground it seemed as though someone were
seating the soles with a red-hot iron. There
was a constant itching which was very trying,
particularly at nights as it made sleep im-
possible. I tried all the largely advertised
remedies, such as ointments, soaps, etc.,
but all these acted only as so much water
might have done.
“I was advised to try Cuticura Ointment
which I did and am pleased to say that in
an incredible short space of time the inflam-
mation had disappeared and the cure was so
complete that I afterwards engaged in foot-
ball, an idea which in my former condition
was the height of absurdity. I have also
used the Cuticura Ointment for boils and
find that it is highly satisfactory and best
of all. completely eliminates the usual dis.
figuring marks. I have also used Cuticura
Soap and would not think of washing with
the old adulterated, impure rubbish which, is
wrongly called soap. I wish you would pub-
lish this letter so that other sufferers may
benefit by my experience ” (Signed) Gus
Forde Long, 282 Dorcas St. So. Melbourne,
Vic., Mar. 26, 1911.
Slcin-sufferers! Do you realize that to go
through life tortuted and disfigured by itch-
ing, burning, scaly and crusted eczemas, or
other skin and scalp humours is unnecessary?
For more than a generation, warm bathe
with Cuticura Soap and gentle applications
of Citticura Ointment have proved successful
in the most distressing cases, of
children and adults, when all else had failed.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold through-
out the world. A liberal sample of Cuticura
Ointment, with a ! 32-page book on the care
and treatment of skin and hair will be sent
free on application to R. Towns & Co., Dept.

IMMEDIATE RELIEF
•btained' by the use of Dr. Scheuble’s Samol, the
latest discovery for the treatment of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica, - Eczema, and kindred complaints.
The following is one of hundreds of unsolicited
testimonials received from people who have received
benefit from the use of this new treatment: —
York Road, Beecroft, Vic., June 7, 1911.
“Dear Sir,—My husband had suffered with sciatica
for over 18 weeks, and had been under Doctor’s
treatment*, but got no relief. I was looking at the
paper and saw your advertisement of ‘Samol’ being
good for Sciatica, and I sent and got a tube. The
first application gave relief and sleep, which he had
not had for 18 weeks.
‘‘l have recomended it to four different friends of
mine, and they all found it a great benefit to them.
“(Signed) (Mrs.) S. A. BOWERMAN.”
Samol is sold in tubes, price Is. 6d., 3s. 9d., and

A majority of the electors may not decide to vote
for the Liberal candidate to-morrow, but they may
find later on that the only way to get relief from
approaching ruin will be to give Liberalism a chance
again. —Cheery reflection by S. M. Herat, n, 17/5/’l2.
In that black hour when Ruin strides
About the blighted State,
And utter destitution rides,
Like some abhorrent Fate,
In ’bus and cab, on tram and train,
The crowd may turn to US again.
When judgment orders strew the streets
Like Vallambrosan leaves,
And every second man one meets
Has summonses in sheaves,
Then, at long last, our side may score,
And “Liberalism” reign once more.
>'
Writters are us-u-a-lly shunned ;
Yet, shall there come a day
When folks will hanker to be dunned
B’or debts they cannot pay.
For then the world will understand
That “Liberalism’s” hour’s at hand.
Meanwhile, let Labor have its fling.
Our day of Might will dawn
When nobody owns anything
Since everything’s in pawn,
And all the State with joy is wild
Because its schedule has been filed.

Who Will Hold the Gun?
Some absurd Australian cranks are clamor-
ing these days against the universal mili-
tary training idea, on the plea that it is a
scheme whereby a weapon is to be forged
for the use of capital. They hold that if
the boy of to-day is trained to use a gun he
will use it at the bidding of capital to shoot
the old man when the old man goes on
strike. And when the trained boy of to-day
grows up in a few years and becomes a
trained man, the cranks evidently fear that
he will shoot himself when he goes on strike,
or that his son, the trained boy of the next
generation, will shoot him, or that he will
shoot the boy, or that they will shoot each
other, or that they will both shoot the moon,
or the rapids of Niagara, or something of
the sort. In fact, the. great idea of the
Australian anti-defence individuals who
loom so large and numerously among the
trades unionists of Broken Hill and a few
other places, is that the rifle should be kept
out of the hands of the workman and the
workman’s son, because they can’t be
trusted with it or with the knowledge how
to use it. These people want the gun re-
served exclusively for a small, separate
military caste, made ufi of voluntary folk
who prefer shooting as a profession to or-
dinary industry. In some parts of the U.S.
the matter is viewed quite differently. There
the capitalist sees that compulsory military
training is an idea which puts the gun in
the hands of the worker, and he prefers the
voluntary, professional hired swashbuckler.
If the people are not trained 20,000 stipen-
diary soldiers, well-led, can keep down a
million of them, and it is easy for capital-
ists who have a million people to live upon
to maintain 20,000 well-paid and well-
armed professional fighting men. Also, it
is easy to find 20,000 athletic wasters who
wouldn’t scruple, for adequate hire, to shoot
down every unionist who ever talked elo-
quently about the doctrine of peace, non-
resistance and universal brotherhood. Thus
it was that the authorities of Portland
(U.S.A.) flatly refused to allow the propa-
gation of the quasi-hbilitary Boy Scout
movement thereabouts. The Boy Scout
business may be wild and hairy and sensa-
tional and ridiculous and Deadwood Dicky,
but it suggests the germ of universal mili-
tary training. “These boys will be the fac-
tory hands of to-morrow,’ said one affluent
person significantly. And if the factory
hand began to dream of carrying the gun
j himself by a process pf universal military
training, instead of leaving that weapon
solely in the hands of the military caste,
what a lot of things might happen!
Here are three shipping items clipped in
one week from the column where the ink
has a strong flavor of brine
Captain H. J. Johnson has been commissioned by
the Wallarah Coal Co. to proceed to Glasgow and
bring out their new collier, which is now being built
by the Clyde Shipbuilding Company. About three
years ago Captain Johnson brought out the collier
Beulah to Sydney for the Wallarah Coal Company.
Captain Sim, of the steamer Grantala, will leave
Sydney next Saturday for London by the R.M.S.
China, to bring out to Australia the Adelaide S.S.
Company’s second new passenger steamer, the Wan-
dilla, which is expected to leave about August next.
Captain Brissenden has taken command of the Gran-
tala.
Looking clean and trim after her successful voyage
from the Clyde, the North Coast S.N. Company’s new
steamer Pulganbar berthed at the Company’s wharf
yesterday morning, and throughout the day had many
admirers. She is without doubt a fine type of
steamer. Captain A. F. Hmb brought the Pulganbar
out. She left the Clyde on March 30, and met squally
weather right away. ,
Unfortunately there is nothing unusual
about the three captains or their jobs. They
are only proceeding to the other side of the
world to take the wheels of three more for-
eign-made vessels and bring them safely out
to join the cloud of marine imports that
make -smoke-trails round this sea-girt con-
tinent. Three classes of ship are _ repre-
sented in the group, viz., coaster, collier, and
inter-State liner. But Australia, which im-
poses no duty on foreign-made craft, is not
allowed to work up to that stage of ship
construction. Its noblest work of late years
has been the little harbor craft used by the
ferry companies. The old paddle-wheeler
Fairlight, which was brought out from Scot-
land 34 years ago, was towed to the ship-
breaker’s yard the other day, after a long
and honorable career of churning to and
from Manly with Billo and his tart. Now-
adays the son of Billo and the lat-
ter’s erstwhile tart , takes lli's bit of
skirt down to the Village in a locally-built
craft. But there the shipbuilding advance
of nearly 40 years ends abruptly; if he
foams down to Melbourne to see the Cup
j run, he does it, as his old man did before
him, in an imported vessel. This continual
exodus of captains is a reminder that the
time is ripe—if not actually rotten —for a
few Australian-built liners to shove their
cutwaters through the blue Pacific. It is a
degrading thing to have to admit, but the
Australian, in an industrial sense, has
hardly ventured outside the Heads for many
years.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad
to hear of a simple and scientific device which will
restore your hearing, no matter how old you are.
There is no mystery or secrecy about it; we describe
it fully and explain, just how it acts.
You' use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and in the
same way you may use this sound magnifier as an
aid to weak hearing. But, unlike spectacles, the
Wilson Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and.
comfortable. You can’t tell you are wearing them.
No one else can, either, because they are not sgen;
They rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off
them —the strain of trying to hear dim sounds.
What a blessed relief to have done with that
tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para rubber
they cannot be felt, even when the head rests on a
pillow. For the same reason, a blow on the side of
the head will not hurt the ear. In fact, they pro-
tect the ear, the tender inner parts that are so
senstive, from cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing
sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why these
facts are true, and why the Sound Magnifier restores
the hearing, we give an illustration of one as it lies
in the ear. You will notice that the Sound Magni-
fier is shaped
like a trumpet,
and so con-
veys even the
faintest sounds
right to the
natural ear-
dram. Being
of the softest
rubber, it can-
not hurt the
ear. It fits the
orifice of the
ear with preci-
sion and com-
fort. The di-
vision that
runs across the
mouth is to al-
low the remo-
val and inser-
tion of the
Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape
of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has
been chosen
after years of
experience a s
the best adapt-
ed to carry the faintest sound right down to the
natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not only
trying to have people shout at them, but it hurts
the ear-drum. When age comes the ear-drum some- ]
times gets thickened, or loses its tightness, and
shouting does not act properly on it. It only
makes a confused and tiring noise. But the
Sound Magnifiers concentrate the sound in the best
spot for perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-nerve
completely, or were born deaf, we cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could do that, in spite
of some of the absurd claims made to-day. But if
you can hear the faintest sound, do not despair.
You will never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people in
Australia and New Zealand, who have been cured,
and you can be cured, too. You may wear the Ear-
Drums day and night, and take them out whenever
you wish. Children can wear them (we have spe-
cial sizes for children from six to twelve). Even
a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit); This includes a pair of drums (they
are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover and
also an inserter. After the first pair is bought you
may purchase a single drum at any time for Bs.,
but the pair you get at first will last quite
two years. Do 'not ask for a trial pair. We do
not send them out on trial, and so they are never
secondhand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent you at once, with the fullest
instructions. Don’t delay, but have the comfort of
good hearing as soon as you can.

Don’t Throw Your
Safety Razor Blades
Away.
The reason most men will not continue the use of
Safety Razors is only on account of the blades being
blunt. While an ordinary razor requires stropping
before every shave, a safety razor blade only needs
sharpening every third shave, having a much finer
edge. It is really unnecessary to buy new blades
when the old ones become blunt. We guarantee to
sharpen and re-sharpen every blade sent to us, to
your entire satisfaction —to give you an easy, smooth,
delightful shave, You will find it is a pleasure to
use them.
Please note that our charge for sharpening your
blades, and guaranteeing them, is 1/6 per dozen, and
2d. for postage.,
P.S. —If you do not own a Safety Razor, secure
one of ours ; it is the most reliable and cheapest on
the market. Post free, 4/9 each complete.

Every Home
Needs Zam-Buk
10,000,000 MOTHERS
are realising to-day that a handy pot of Zam-Buk is a priceless boon.
Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its healing, soothing and
germ-destroying qualities, but gives us for the first time an ever-ready
“first-aid,” uniting simplicity, effectiveness and safety.
Because it requires no previous preparation, needs
1 simply to be taken out of the pot with the clean
finger-end and rubbed gently over the cut or sore, when the fine herbal juices
sink into the tiny pores in the skin and “get at” the harmful germs that
are lodging in the under-tissues.
Effective. Because Zam-Buk is prepared by methods entirely dif-
■ ferent and ahead of mere oint-
ments and cheap salves or “creams.” Because it
is composed of pure gums, juices and aromatic oils,
scientifically refined and skilfully combined. The
uniform success of Zam-Buk shows that the ideally
effective balm has been discovered at last.
Because Zam-Buk’» active constituents con-
i.,.* tain no trace of rancid animal fat, mineral
irritant or poisonous acid. Because Zam-Buk achieves its
exceptional results by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the frailest invalid and
the youngest babe. It is the one and onlv
Zam-Buk, as sold in sealed packages.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a
daily need ; and its instant applica-
tion on cut, sprain or sore is a sure
safeguard against blood-poisoning
germ diseases and all the common
complications of accidents and skin
diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BPK.
Mrs. S. M. Burgess, of 34Cambridge
Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says:—“For
such injuries as cuts, abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
always falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk should be kept on a handy shelf
In every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds, Zam-Buk is a splendid remedy.”

Jim-Jam Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, a wondrous land is the Jim-Jam
Land to one who has been there,
Where the Grim Past drags you by the
feet, and the Future by the hair;
Where the Ghastly Present grasps your
throat and sits on your stifling chest,
And Imps of the Blue-Funk prod you up
when you would seek your rest.
Ask anv man in the Public Bar. If he only
grips your hand
And says no word, it may be inferred that
he’s been in Jim-Jam Land.
When it’s Ten O’Clock in the Public Bar,
and you’ve left off Beer for Rum,
And the Landlord’s face is an evil place in
the lurid clouds that come.
When you seek to fight your dearest friend,
and you hug your foe instead;
When you sit down hard, and you find your-
self three miles away in bed —
And the bed swings round to its proper place
to the bang of the Fiend’s own band,.
And the door and the window waltz to theirs
—then you’re bound for Jim-Jam Land.
When the plastered ceiling’s centre-piece is
a Devil’s grinning face,
Ana round and round the skirting-board the
little Fantods race;
When your clothes behind the bedroom door,
no matter how hard you look,
Are either a man who has hanged himself
or a shrouded, skull-faced spook;
When a Caliban squats and glowers and
glows where stood the mild waslistand,
And the arm of the lounge is a coilsome
snake —’tis the Border of Jim-Jam
Land.
When a grisly Something nudges you in the
early morning mirk,
And yelps your name in your startled ear,
as you sit up with a jerk—
When a Something taps as you settle down
and try to sleep once more,
And a Lurk looks in with a cheerful grin at
your balcony bedroom door.
When a hairy arm comes reaching round
with a monstrous claw-like hand —
And its mate comes in through the nearest
wall —Oh! then you’re in Jim-Jam
Land.
When an old hen roosts on the rod o’erhead
with the face and the beak of a hag,
And in spite of the Jim-Jam chorus round
continues to nag—nag —nag ;
While the friends of your Dead Past bar-
rack for you—those dear old friends
long dead —
And your aunts, and the rest of your living
kin have a row behind the bed;
When the wife that divorced you takes you
back, and your future lot is planned,
And her friends come round to congratulate
—O-o-o-h!! then you’re in Jim-Jam
Land.
When you’re out, far out in the Mulga
Scrub (or you think that you are
there),
And you’ve blued your cheque at the Take
Down Pub, and you’ve lost your swag
somewhere;
When the Nothing slaps you on the back,
and your kick-out bottle’s done,
,And the Voices wail in your maddened
brain till you shed your pants and run ;
When the Jumps and the Screamers race
abreast across the burning sand.
And your feet are scorched by the floors of
Hell —Oh! then you’re in Jim-Jam
Land.
When the short, thick serpents pave the
ground, and they shoot their tongues
and hiss,
And their black heads wave to the sky-line
round—Oh! there is no land like this.
When you climb a tree and the limbs are
snakes, and you drop down in despair—
And they cross like swords, and your shirt’s
a kilt, and you dance the sword dance
there;
When you streak at last for the Edge of
Things, and chance their fangs—it’s
grand!
'You’re glad to catch up with the Leaps again
in the heart of Jim-Jam Land.
'Yet cheer, my friend, keep your pecker up—
in a week you’ll be all right,
And you’ll learn to know as the years go by
that the Jim-Jam snakes don’t bite.
And the Lurks and the Howls are a jovial
crowd, all born of the jovial cup,
And the little Fantods, if you only know,
are trying to help you up.
'You’ll come back fresh to the world again
with a Will at your command,
With a kinder heart and a clearer brain for
a night in Jim-Jam Land.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.
Jealousy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
storm centre of the local Bohemia
was Eulalia Gayle, a tall, beautiful
girl whose exquisitely chiselled fea-
tures were framed in a wealth of dark
-brown hair, and who all her life had been
worried by a multiplicity of admirers.
But it was not till she had attained woman-
hood and was living alone in the world that
.the full unpleasantness that invariably fol-
lows a superfluity of that sort was brought
properly home to her.
It was not casual admirers that worried
her. They were the creatures of an after-
noon, and although interesting, of no
Mere products of four o’clock tea
and evanescent emanations of social even-
ings, they served their purpose, which was
like that of mussels, to fill a gap in life’s
entertainment when the oysters were tem-
porarily off. .
These latter fish were three: The Busi-
ness Man, the Lawyer and the Engineer,
whom the first two called “The Other Fel-
low.”
Of the three the Business Man counted
for the least. He had once been supreme,
or as they said in Bohemia, “right bower”
hut the suit had changed suddenly owing to
This own unspeakable folly, and he became
.merely a knave.
The Lawyer, although more formidable,
had a hard row to hoe, for he was a rela-
tive by marriage, and the fact that it was
his own marriage made it all the harder. So
the stars in their courses and the morals of
the evening paper tragedy stories all told
against him. Still, he did not despair, and
by a thousand cunning devices sought to
enmesh her in natural but lawless passion.
The Engineer, the two considered, had far
the best of it. And so did he, but his pre-
eminent bliss was marred by the fact that he
could not marry her; for the Engineer had
a past, with a tall, grey-eyed woman in it.
Although he was never able to convince
her of the fact, the Engineer loved Eulalia
with all the devotion that his somewhat curi-
ous nature was capable of. Occasionally he
doubted if he was capable of anything like a
grand passion.
None of the three ever mentioned her name
to the others, but when they met, which was
mostly in her sitting-room, they read each
other like open books, and hated accord-
ingly. Both the Lawyer and the Engineer
despised the Business Man, knowing him to
be incapable of real affection for anyone but
himself. The love he bore for his. own un-
lovely body and even less beautiful soul
was hideously real, and the only sincere thing
about him. His adoration for her was just
plain, unrelieved selfishness. Eulalia was
beautiful, the most lovely woman of his
circle! And he wanted her just on account
of that loveliness, just as he wanted the
best pictures and choicest cigars, because he
felt that the best going was not too good
for him, and, in fact, only his due. He
knew that he would throw her aside, just as
he did a thrum smoke when someone hap-
pened along with a ninepenny cigar, and
some more beautiful or better endowed
woman happened along. And Eulalia knew
it. Also the Business Man was aware that
Eulalia knew it, and felt bad about the
neighborhood of his vanity in consequence.
In the meantime, prosaic gentlemen came
trooping along proposing marriages that
meant solid comfort and large social duties.
But the Girl, recognising that they hadn’t
a spark of poetry or romance in their com-
position, and being still romantic and a
believer in love, refused them all, vowing she
would never marry till her affections were
won. She was financially independent in
that she had a profession which brought her
in about £4 per week, out of which she could
always find the necessaries of existence.
So far, the only men who had interested
her were the three, and, looking the matter
calmly over, she realised that these three
were inextricably mixed up with her future,
and had acquired positions of importance in
her life from which it was unlikely that they
would be easily shifted. Of the three, the
Business Man was the only one free to
marry her, and, very naturally, was the
only one of the three she would never dream
of marrying under any circumstances. And
yet he interested her. She liked occasionally
to listen to his cheerfully cynical conversa-
tion for an hour or so after dinner, and
then see or hear no more of him for the best
part of a week.
Occasionally, during these after-dinner
talks, the Business Man’s conceit in his own
powers of attraction would rise superior to
the depressing knowledge that she knew him
as he really was, and he would try to resume
his old position of her affianced husband.
But it always ended the same way. Either
the Girl became brutally sarcastic or one or
other of the remaining brutes would arrive
and upset the apple-cart.
The Lawyer was gay. His idea of happi-
ness was a whirl of life and quick sensa-
tions. Brilliant company, champagne sup-
pers, motor-car drives, theatres and moon-
light excursions in fast launches made up
his ideal life. To attain some of them, or a
sprinkling, of them all, with the loveliness of
Eulalia to give it spice, he gambled desper-
ately and juggled with trust moneys in a
parlous way. The Devil looking carefully
after his own, he came out right every time,
and with the proceeds of his villainy he
sought to dazzle the Girl and sweep her off
her feet in a vortex of pleasure.
It all had its effect.
T(ie Girl became accustomed to these
things, and gradually they became almost
necessary, so that, without knowing it, she
clung to him because of them. But all her
life she had practised self-restraint, and the
Lawyer found that in spite of the whirl and
the dazzle she kept both her head and her
feet.
How much the memory of the Engineer
haa to do with it the Lawyer did not know,
but he blamed him for a lot. And he was
fairly right, too, for of the three Eulalia
liked him the best —sometimes she felt that
the regard she had for him had attained the
intensity that is usually dignified by the
name of Love, and there were days when she
longed to see him enter her room with the
news that he was free and anxious to link
his life permanently with hers. Everyone
told her strange stories of his career, which,
according to these stories, seemed to consist
mostly of a procession of fair women and
disgraceful scrapes. But against that she
placed the fact that the procession had
stopped since he had known her, and for once
in his life he had been content to worship
one goddess only.
So she went on practising self-restraint,
and waiting for something to happen that
would shape her future life for her. She
knew how dangerous it was to drift, but no-
thing else seemed possible. While she drifted
the Lawyer made the whirl revolve faster,
and she trembled to think she must be rapidly
approaching the vortex.
The Engineer viewed this self-restraint
with doubt. Occasionally he flamed into
wild fits of passionate jealousy, during which
he meditated the murder of the Lawyer. As
he ruminated over the position, he would
demand passionately why she continued to
place herself in positions in which she had
to continually act on the defensive, and he
ground his teeth, which were his own. The
Lawyer’s were bought out of the trust
money.
If Eulalia was content to allow Time to
settle matters, the Lawyer was not,. He
made a great coup, and also had an exceed-
ingly narrow shave, so close as to convince
him that in future trust moneys must be
held sacred. Anyhow, the coup had given
him, sufficient caoital to enable him to leave
the trust funds alone, and, incidentally, to
bring things with Eulalia to a climax. He
was somewhat Napoleonic in his methods,
and was a great believer of the wisdom of
an aggressive policy.

I AM ”
No one knows the suffering some women quietly endure.
They think it is only natural for them to have pain in the back,
throbbing headaches, dizzy spells, rheumatic twinges, irregular
heart, and to feel tired and worn out before the; day is half
through. And .so they bear up as best they can, in patience
and without complaint, never thinking they can be cured, never
suspecting the kidneys as the cause of their illness.
But it is not right for women to be always ailing, and the
best proof of this is given in the outspoken statements of Sydney
women who have been made well, and kept well, by Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, the great kidney and bladder medicine
for men and women, old and young. Doan’s Pills gently heal
the tired, overworked kidneys, and when the kidneys are well

BACKACHE, and KIDNEY TROUBLE CURED.
Mrs. T. Lewis, 133 Dowling Street, Woolloomooloo, Sydney, says : “For years I was a constant
sufferer from backache and kidney trouble. My back used to ache till I felt I could hardly bear it
any longer. Every movement gave me increased pain, and I could get nothing to give me ease. The
• kidney, secretions were much affected and very irregular. One day I heard about Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, so I got a bottle.* I commenced taking them, and in a few days knew they were doing
me good. As I continued with the remedy, my health rapidly improved, and I was soon quite free
of backache and every other distressing symptom of kidney trouble.”.
Nine years later, Mrs. Lewis says: “Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills permanently cured me, for
I have been free of backache for the last nine years. My lasting cure is all the more wonderful, con-
sidering my age —I am 83.”

He furnished a delightful cottage over-
looking the harbor, and placed in it every-
thing he believed she could reasonably desire.
The best of pictures on the walls, the most
artistic of furniture, her favorite tints in
the decorations, and in the silver caskets in
the bedroom the jewels her soul was hungry
for.
It would have been a colossal temptation if
allowed to soak in gradually, so to speak;
but his impetuosity spoiled everything. He
sprung his offer on her after a night of grand
opera, followed by a motor drive and a cham-
pagne supper in the cottage itself. The three
hours of Italian music had taken her out of
her own life, and caused her to lose a grip
on her own affairs. She was brought back
suddenly to find herself struggling in the
vortex she had always dreaded and deter-
mined to avoid.
Next day, when she tried to recall the
events of that amazing evening, protesta-
tions, pleadings, frenzied declarations of love
and frantic attempts to take her in his arms,
were all jumbled up together in her mind.
Amid her blurred memories she could dis-
tinctly recall that every time he tried to
reason, she had blocked him with the re-
peated and parrot-like repetition of “Don’t
talk to me like that. I’ll scream, I’ll
scream!” Which provoked him horribly,
and caused him to rage in impotent fury, till
he called in the housekeeper and bade her
try and calm the hysterical silly.
She remembered how the first breath of
the cool night air had braced up her shat-
tered nerves when he started to walk her
down to the tram, telling her in a low voice
all the way what he thought of her. Among
the epithets he applied to her the word
“harpy” was about the most refined.
And thinking it all over, she admitted to
herself that she had been indiscreet, and
vowed that she would never see him again.
She was at dinner with the Engineer. He
had made history, and had floated a syndi-
cate which had taken up some of his inven-
tions. He had stepped from a life of hard,
strenuous, unremunerative toil to that of a
captain of industry, and to a seat at the
council board of the Kings of Gold. Before
him he saw fame and wealth—if she would
link her life with his he would also see hap-
piness. Then he went on to explain how he
had gained his freedom. His wife was al-
ways short of money, no matter how much
she had, and he had made arrangements to
buy his freedom per medium of the Divorce
Court. It would be what the Judges call
collusion. And he smiled dreamily, and blew
a cloud of scented smoke towards the ceiling,
and looked the incarnation of happiness.
Then leaning there on her white arms, puff-
ing daintily at a mild cigarette, she told him,
as one tells of a nightmare, of her adventure.
Half-way through the recital she wished she
had not commenced, faltered, and stopped
suddenly.
“Go on!” said the Engineer, very quietly.
She went on to the end, and then looked
at him for sympathy.
Instead of which she saw an expression of
sternness that almost frightened her. He re-
garded the ceiling fixedly.
“How long were you there?”
“Oh, about an hour and a half, I sup-
pose—it seemed years to me. I could not
say. I felt angry with you that you did not
walk in and take me away. But it is all
over now. I shall recognise him no more.”
“Eulalia, it is not all over. You -will
think me unreasonable and unkind; but I
cannot help it. This thing would rise up for
ever between us, and it would grow. Why
did you persist in placing yourself in this
position. You must have known that this
married man was not likely to shower all
this gaiety on you without the hope of Some
ultimate reward, or unless he had a great
and abiding affection for you. In either
case, you had no right to accept. Even now
it makes me tremble with rage, and as the
days roll on it will irritate me more. If I
am to think anything of you, that man must
be killed —and even that would not undo it.”
Eulalia stared at him with unbelieving
eyes. \
“By your manner of speaking you seem
to think that I was something more tflan a
friend to this man. You are quite mistaken.”
Then she threw her arms round his
neck, and breathed out the things that
women usually do in such cases. The Engi-
neer removed her arms, and drew himself
away.
“It is worse than useless to talk of it. The
thing would grow and grow. I know I am
unreasonable —I know that without anyone
telling me. But it is my nature, and I am
myself, and cannot help it. When you are
ready, I will take you home.”
She rose instantly, and walked by his
side with a light, firm step that concealed
the inward tumult splendidly. He left her
at the door, and as he turned the latch-key
for her, the Girl remarked :
“He was a scoundrel. You are a mixture
of prig and fool. Seek out some woman of
superlative ugliness whom no one will tempt,
and then you will be supremely happy. In
the meantime, I’m tired of your whole sex!”
Then she shut the door softly, like a
woman who has had her say, and, stealing
upstairs, cast herself down on the sofa in an
agony of tears, crying and sobbing till, like
a child, she fell asleep.
Next morning, when she read the papers,
she found that, after all, the Engineer did
love her. He had killed the Lawyer first and
himself afterwards.
S~ there remained the Business Man.

Leeches.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HE doctor threw his hopes overboard
at last. Plainly enough now it was
iritis again. So the blinds were
drawn, and I settled down to wait for the
little devils that have charge of the torture
of the iritis-damned.
Four years ago I had found out the
difference between this and the common or
garden variety of sore eye; and then it
seemed to me, lying in the beautiful dark,
that the little devils were happiest when
they took the shape of two cats. One sat
on the bridge of my nose, the other on my
temple, and thus facing one another they
clawed at the ball of fire that floated be-
tween them in a sea of inflammation. This
time the little devils had apparently run
out of cats, so they sat on the edge of the
sea and shot fiery arrows into the quivering
eyeball. Sometimes the darts only pierced
the surface ; at others they sped on till they
collided, -with an explosion that sent elec-
tric sparks sizzling along the nerves to the
uttermost hair-root.
It was at the end of the second century
(other people said it w T as the second night,
but I prefer my own reckoning) that the
doctor said that leeches might be given a
chance. He didn’t appear to regard leeches
with enthusiasm. If he had been making a
professional call 50 years ago he would pro-
bably have prescribed leeches in the first
five minutes ; but the modern doctor regards
the ugly worm as a sort of unqualified prac-
titioner, to be called in in much the same
spirit as Kitchener would whistle up a
corps of Chinese stinkpot cavalry, or as an
Admiral would refer a question of naval
strategy to the bo’sun of the North Shore
horse-punt.
But it was one thing to say “Let there
be leeches” and another thing to let the
leeches be. The chemist on the first corner
said he was sorry but he had none. The
chemist on the next corner had none and
didn’t appear sorry. The third chemist said
we might have five for half a crown. As
an afterthought, he added that we might
have the rest of his stock for d shilling.
He seemed to have little hope of ever meet-
ing anybody else who would want leeches.
I had my own ideas about leeches. I
vaguely regarded them as ravenous beasts
that scented blood from afar and made haste
to the banquet, no matter what sort of flesh
it happened to be in. The leech of com-
merce is a different animal. You capture
him from his bottle with great difficulty—
unless he is dead, which he seems to be
pretty frequently. If he isn’t dead his one
aim in life appears to be to stay in the
bottle and avoid work. When you grasp at
him he is a 4-inch arch of wiry worm ; in
the twinkling of an eye he shrinks into a
shapeless blob, and your fingers’ close on
space. Having with diligence arrested him
you make a guess as to which is his busi-
ness end, and insert it into a glass tube.
According to your old ideas he should rush
down the tube and get to work. But he
doesn’t. You prod him, and he doesn’t
move. You smear the flesh with milk, and
he still despises it. You take him out of
the tube and hold his head against his ban-
quet, and he turns away in disgust. No-
body is ever really so contemptible as every-
body feels when he has newly-acquired a
bad eye; and the man with a bad eye never
feels quite so cheap as when a leech has
definitely turned him down. There is no
insult beyond that.
The trouble with the leech of commerce
is that he is no good unless he is hungry.
Ilis keeper, the chemist, is therefore in this
position: if he feeds the brute, the brute is
no good, and if he doesn’t feed the hrute the
time comes when the brute ceases to take
any interest .in food or anything else. Some
days afterwards, when the local supply of
leeches had been exhausted, the city shops
were ransacked. Four said they were sorry,
but all their leeches had died waiting for
customers. The fifth, which wore a crest,
said haughtily that it was a chemist’s shop,
and not a menagerie. The sixth said
briskly that it had three left. _ When it
came back to deliver the goods it confided
sadly that those three were dead too.
Still, you do occasionally find a leech ot
commerce with an appetite. When he has-
been prodded sufficiently the enraged worm
begins his meal. You feel a few sharp
stabs under the eye; then the pumps get to
work, and gradually a damp, clammy
sausage fills itself upon your cheek. With
a fringe of these I believe no patient can be
regarded as really beautiful. An energetic
leech will feed for just half an hour. But
if he has done his work well it is possible
that the wound he has made will bleed
gently for another 12 hours. Science has
tried to produce, a cleanly substitute ; but
science doesn’t know how. The ugly worm,
when he has sunk his artesian bore, lines it
with a substance which prevents the coagu-
lation of the blood; so it flows on gently
long after he has fallen off, a helpless,
swollen capitalist.
When that happens the leech of commerce
is mostly hurried to destruction. There is
no created thing which enjoys quite such
rotten luck. If he waits too long for a
customer he dies. If a customer comes
while yet he has strength to take in a meal
which would comfortably last him 12
months, he is hurried from his banquet to
his grave. He has no luck either way.
Yet he deserves a lot; for as he gets to
work and eases the congestion, the little
devils fall farther and farther back into the
darkness, and you slide softly into sleep.
It was six hours before the little, devils
came back and woke me with the horrid
suggestion that there might be something in
the idea of the transmigration of souls.
They wanted to know what were the odds
that I might not be this other sort of luck-
less worm next time!

A Cycle of Winds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the loud, soft winds are laughing free,
And the big, green rollers come from the sea.
Shouting in spray at the brown cliff’s knee
In jest of its rocky scorning,
When Susan’s dress is the young day’s sport,
And Mary’s hat has a list to port
Oho 1 for the laughing morning I
When the rolling dust-clouds sweep the street,
Where the ways are thronged with the countless feet,
And the horses sweat in the broiling heat
While the German band is tuning,
With a hint of roses drowned in snow,
Under breeze-kissed veils the girleens go—
Oho, for a pleasant nooning i
When the chill, sweet winds creep up the bay,
And the Night’s arms crush the yielding Day
To the sweet, low dirge that the waters play
As the stars in their depths are soaking,
It is good to sit upon George’s knee,
With his young scrub whiskers tickling me,
While the large tame beast is smoking.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no -need, how-
ever, of such 'conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True- Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the tirn’e
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-fir'' the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting- cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in \yith an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I ,jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming' forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm,.yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is-the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.
